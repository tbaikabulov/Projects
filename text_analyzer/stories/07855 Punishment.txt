Synopsis:  A sub pushes her Master too far






 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He met her at her car and stopped short at the sight of a baby seat in the back seat.&nbsp; He looked at her questioningly. �I'm... having a baby..� she said.&nbsp; His face froze; �Are you serious?� he asked.&nbsp; �No� she replied as she burst out laughing, �I've been babysitting but oh my god you should have seen your face it was hilarious!�&nbsp; His face became expressionless. �That wasn't funny� he said. �Oh yes it was!� she replied.&nbsp; As her laughter slowed he said �No, it really wasn't Rebecca....� Her laughter came to a stop and her body tensed as she heard her name and the seriousness in his voice. Quite quickly she knew that he was no longer speaking as a friend but as her Master.&nbsp; She bowed her head and swallowed trying to slow her breathing.&nbsp; �I'm sorry� she saiid, as she stood in front of him with her head lowered, knowing she shouldn't have played the joke.&nbsp; �You will be� he replied and her body went tense again.&nbsp; �You will learn not to push me Rebecca.�&nbsp;&nbsp; With the second use of her name in so short a time she knew she was in trouble. He continued. �Get inside.�&nbsp; �Yes Master� she replied quickly, with a trembling voice.&nbsp; She turned quickly and walked across the yard and inside, trembling as she went with a growing feeling of unease knowing that she had finally angered him enough to be punished.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As she walked inside, he closed the door behind her and locked it.&nbsp; She stopped unsure of where to go.&nbsp; �On your knees� she heard, and dropped to her knees immediately with her head bowed again, her hands at her sides.&nbsp; She clenched her hands and teeth trying to calm her mind; a useless task now that she was in a session with her Master and he most certainly wasn't happy with her.&nbsp;&nbsp; She heard the sound of leather moving behind her as he took off his belt and tightened her body.&nbsp; She saw him move and walk until he was standing in front of her.&nbsp; She could see the belt rolled up in his hand as he extended his hand and raised her face to look up using the end of the belt to nudge under her chin.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She looked up nervously as her faced is raised and trembles as she sees her Master's dead serious face. THWACK! Her face jerked to the side as he slaps her across the face once.&nbsp;&nbsp; �Now remember your rules. Stay.�&nbsp; he said as he walked away towards his room.&nbsp; She kept her body still not daring to move as her cheek stung.&nbsp; Her eyes teared slightly as she thought about the slap, having never been struck by her Dom before in punishment.. especially not the face.. only occasionally on her ass her during play.&nbsp; Being slapped in the face brought afresh the knowledge that before now she had never been punished.&nbsp; She knew that was now changing for she didn't believe that the single slap was the end of the punishment. No not at all.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She heard him walk back in but didn't move.&nbsp; He stood in front of her and said �Up. Strip.�&nbsp; It was killing her that he wasn't even yelling at her. Just softly spoken commands with a tone she knew she had to obey.&nbsp; As she stood shakily she began to strip and left her clothes in a pile.&nbsp; He waited a moment for her to finish then said �Come.� and walked back into the room he has just exited with her following in his wake.&nbsp; Once in the room, a soft order was spoken out.&nbsp; �Against the bed.�&nbsp; Quick to follow, she stood and pressed her stomach against the bed and leaned over.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She heard rummaging but knew better than to turn and see what he was getting.&nbsp; She was in enough trouble and knew she should be on best behavior so as not to worsen it.&nbsp; Soon after she heard him kneel and felt a strap latching around one ankle, then the other, followed by her Master standing again and going back to his things.&nbsp; She shifted then gasped as she realized there was a spreader bar connected to the straps. She wouldn't be moving easily until it was removed.&nbsp; Suddenly she gasped as she felt a wet plug at her ass. In a soft voice she said �Please I can't handle it I won't be able to keep it in, Master� but her pleas were ignored as it was worked in and out, her gasps of pain and tightness following until finally it slid in and she partially collapsed against the bed as her body held it tightly inside.&nbsp; Breathing deeply, she tried to concentrate and not think of that huge thing inside her, making its presence known.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He grabbed her hands and tied them tightly behind her back.&nbsp; She tested them once out of reflex.&nbsp; They weren't coming lose.&nbsp; But she already knew it wouldn't.&nbsp; Once he restrained her she didn't go anywhere.&nbsp; She lay there, bound and uncomfortable waiting, knowing he was standing right there but not doing anything.&nbsp; Thoughts ran through her head like wild fire, thinking of everything that could happen.&nbsp; She couldn't help herself from thinking of everything that her Master may do to her.&nbsp; Not knowing what was happening was horrible because it let her mind wander and torture herself with the lack of knowledge.&nbsp; She shifted slightly, as her ass became more uncomfortable, unaccustomed to having the larger size in her.&nbsp; She knew her body wanted it out but couldn't get rid of it while she was tied and restrained.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;TTTHWACKK! She screamed as the belt connected with her ass.&nbsp; It continued on and on over her ass and upper thighs until she was sobbing, feeling as though she was on fire with the burn and sting.&nbsp; As it stopped she lay there spent and crying as her body ached and burned.&nbsp; When she thought it was finally over and started to calm down a hand pressed against her lower back as the plug was slowly pulled out again, renewing her tears as her body had become accustomed to it inside and did not wish to release it. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He leaned down behind her and released her ankles from the restraints as well as the bar, then stood and unbound her hands.&nbsp; As he moved back, still crying, she sunk down to her knees in front of him. �I'm sorry� she said through her tears.&nbsp; He pulled her up, wiped away her tears. �It's alright, love� he said.&nbsp; With that he pulled her onto the bed and held her, soothing away her pain and cries.&nbsp; She lay his arms calm and quiet.&nbsp; �Forgive me?� she asked.&nbsp; �You're forgiven, little one. Just remember you're Mine.� he replied as he pulled her closer to him.&nbsp; She smiled and fit herself closer to him.&nbsp; �Always� she said. She stared at him for a moment before closing her eyes and resting, knowing she was safe in the arms of her Master.
