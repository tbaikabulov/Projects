1. 
It all started out so simply. 

Standing in front of the bedroom
mirror, pursing her red lips together, 
Catherine said, &quot;Matt says he has a new girlfriend.&quot; 

Lying on their bed, glancing through
the new copy of InTheater, Jeff 
said, &quot;Oh yeah?&quot; 

&quot;He's bringing her to
dinner.&quot; 

&quot;That's good.&quot; 

Catherine sighed. &quot;I hope this
one isn't a bimbo.&quot; 

&quot;Matt's the
one who has to date her.&quot; 

&quot;Yeah,&quot; Catherine replied,
&quot;but we're the ones who are going to have to 
talk to her.&quot; 

The fact that his so-sweet girlfriend
could occasionally be such a bitch 
caused Jeff to smile and he looked up from his magazine. She was 
standing with her back to him, putting on her makeup. Catherine Anderson 
was a tall, 18 year-old girl whose thick, blonde-streaked Pown
hair 
reached down to the nape of her neck. She wore small rimless glasses 
that sat on the end of a pert nose and she had a pretty face that was 
sexy simply because it appeared too sweet and innocent to be true. She 
was half-naked, wearing only blue cotton panties that molded perfectly 
into the curves of her luscious ass and a purple bra that held up the 
36D breasts that still sometimes left her self-conscious. Staring at her 
body, Jeff could feel his cock harden. 

&quot;I mean, why can't Matt just for
once, date someone with a brain?&quot; she 
asked, nonchalantly. 

Jeff stood up and, as he slowly
walked towards her, &quot;Maybe he doesn't 
want someone with a brain.&quot; 

Catherine saw Jeff approaching in the
mirror. Jeff Stern was twenty-five 
years old, shorter than her but still handsome with dark hair and 
piercing eyes that always left her feeling exposed whenever they fell on 
her. Catherine had grown up in a small, country town in West Texas - 
sung in the church choir, played in the high school marching band, and 
at her most wild, had left her few boyfriends occasionally feel her up. 
Less than a year ago, she had left for college and now she was living 
with an artistic Jewish guy who was seven years older than her and could 
fuck her with his eyes. Who would have guessed? 

He wrapped his arms around her bare
stomach and nuzzled her neck. 

&quot;Hi,&quot; she said, glancing
away from the image of them reflected in the 
mirror. She felt her pussy moisten and, as much as she wished otherwise, 
it left her feeling embarrassed. 

Jeff continued to kiss her neck as he
moved his hands down towards her 
cunt. As he reached the top of her panties, she said, &quot;Jeff, c'mon, I 
have to get ready.&quot; Gently but firmly, she grabbed his hands and slid 
out of his grasp. 

&quot;We can be a little late,&quot;
Jeff whispered in her ear. 

&quot;Matt's waiting for us-&quot; 

&quot;Matt'll
understand.&quot; 

&quot;That's what I'm scared
of.&quot; 

Jeff was silent for a few minutes and
Catherine feared she had upset 
him. Instead, he suddenly smiled and patted her ass, giving her a 
playful squeeze before walking back to the bed. 

&quot;You got five minutes,&quot;
Jeff said, lying back down, &quot;If you're not ready 
by then, I'm coming to get you.&quot; 

Catherine looked back at him and
smiled. &quot;Behave.&quot; 

Jeff simply smiled back. He knew he'd
behave. In the end, for all the 
smoldering looks and flirtatious innuendo, they always behaved. 

That was the problem. 

2. 

It actually took Catherine ten more
minutes to get ready but it was 
worth it. When they left the apartment for Bari's, she was wearing blue 
jeans that nicely showed off the supple curves of her hips and a tight 
blue shirt that stretched over her pert breasts. As he drove them to the 
restaurant, Jeff noticed the clear impressions of her luscious nipples, 
hardened by the night air, against the shirt's fabric. He knew it was 
something that would terribly embarrass Catherine if she noticed it but 
Jeff remained quiet. 

For what struggling college students
and starving artists could afford, 
Bari's was probably the best Italian restaurant in Mayland, Texas. As 
Jeff and Catherine stepped through the front doors, they saw Matt Welsh 
already sitting in the back of the smoking section. An open bottle of 
Michelob sat on the table in front of him. He was alone. 

&quot;Great,&quot; Catherine
whispered as Jeff waved to Matt, &quot;she dumped him 
already.&quot; 

As they reached the table, Matt
grasped Jeff's hand and then said, &quot;Did 
Catherine tell you about my new woman, yet?&quot; 

Jeff nodded, &quot;Yeah. She dump you already?&quot; 

Matt shook his head. &quot;No, she's
just taking a leak. See - there she is 
now.&quot; 

Matt pointed towards the ladies room
door, which was closing behind a 
young woman with curly brown hair. She stood around 5'4 with a slender 
body - a little too slender for Jeff's tastes. On the whole, he liked 
his women to have rounder hips. However, she did have nice, long legs 
and perky, if not extremely large, breasts. She was wearing tight denim 
shorts that seemed almost tucked into her cunt and showed off almost all 
of her legs. She was wearing a tiny, white tank-top that left her flat 
stomach and pierced belly button exposed. The thin fabric of her top 
revealed her black bra. Both bra straps hung carelessly off her 
shoulders, almost as if they were letting every man in Bari's know how 
easy it would be to unharness her tits. 

&quot;That's my Joey,&quot; Matt
said. 

Catherine leaned over to Jeff and
whispered, &quot;Oh yeah, he's going out 
with her for her mind.&quot; 

Jeff smiled and discreetly glanced
down at the impressions of 
Catherine's still hardened nipples against her shirt. Catherine's 
breasts were definitely larger and fuller than this new girlfriend of 
Matt's and Jeff, being a boob man, definitely preferred Catherine. As 
the new girl walked over to the table, the denim of her shorts showing 
every movement of her well-toned legs. Jeff couldn't keep his eyes off 
her - there was something about her, something so blatantly fuckable
in 
the way this girl moved. When she reached the table, she flashed a 
sudden smile across her kittenish face and gave Matt a long passionate 
kiss. She then turned to Jeff and Catherine. 

Extending her hand, she said,
&quot;Hi, my name's Joey. You can call me 
Joey.&quot; 

Catherine smiled briefly enough to
say, &quot;I'm Catherine.&quot; 

&quot;And you,&quot; Joey said,
&quot;must be Jeff.&quot; 

As Jeff shook her hand and noted that
she had a strong grip but her 
hands still felt soft and seductive, he said, &quot;I must be Jeff?&quot; 

&quot;Matt's told me a lot about
you.&quot; 

Joey sat down beside Matt and gave
him a quick kiss on the cheek. 

&quot;Joey's an actress,&quot; Matt
said, &quot;She's going to try out for the next MCT 
show.&quot; 

Joey smiled. &quot;I can hardly
wait.&quot; 

The MCT was the Mayland
Community Theater. Jeff, Matt, and Catherine had 
all first met when they were in a MCT production of The Importance of 
Being Earnest six months earlier. 

Catherine's voice was acidic as she
asked, &quot;So, how did you and Matt 
meet?&quot; 

Joey shrugged. &quot;Oh, how does
anyone meet? You know what I mean?&quot; 

&quot;No,&quot; Catherine replied,
&quot;I'm afraid I don't.&quot; 

Luckily, the awkward conversation
ended with the arrival of the waiter, 
who took their orders while staring down at Joey's breasts. After the 
waiter left, Catherine leaned over to Jeff and whispered, &quot;Why don't you 
put your eyes back in their sockets before the food arrives?&quot; 

Nervously, Jeff smiled. 

3. 

As usual, dinner was spent listening
to Matt brag. He had the greatest 
car in the world. He was going to write the greatest play of all time. 
Everyone in Mayland knew and loved him. It was the
usual Matt bullshit 
that so many women found to be strangely irresistible. Joey didn't say 
much except to occasionally agree with Matt. Sometimes, Jeff could swear 
that she was looking at him out of the corner of the eyes, giving him a 
flirtatious half-smile, but he also knew he had an active imagination. 

Besides, he was with Catherine. 

After dinner, when Jeff parked the
car in front of their apartment, 
Catherine said, &quot;I'm glad to see Matt's taste hasn't changed. He still 
likes them quiet and stupid...&quot; 

Jeff laughed. &quot;God, why are
women always like that?&quot; 

Sitting in the parked car, only the
dim light of nearby street light 
illuminating her pretty face, Catherine looked at him and asked, &quot;Like 
what?&quot; 

Jeff laughed again. &quot;Evil.&quot; 

&quot;How are we evil?&quot; 

&quot;The stuff you say about each
other. I mean, if women hate each other 
that much, why don't you all just have a war and whoever's left alive at 
the end can decide how everyone should dress and look and then you won't 
have to spend so much time talking about everyone behind their back.&quot; 

To Jeff's relief, Catherine smiled.
&quot;That's a little extreme, don't you 
think?&quot; 

&quot;It'd work.&quot; 

&quot;Jeff, we may be bitchy but
we're not murderers.&quot; 

For some reason, that statement
turned him on. Jeff leaned forward and 
kissed her moist lips. As he moved his tongue into her mouth, he ran his 
hands over her chest, stopping to cup her right breast and rub her 
hardened nipple between his thumb and forefinger. He heard the sound of 
her gasping breath as his left hand glided up her thighs, finally coming 
to a stop at the crotch of her jeans. 

&quot;Jeff,&quot; she gasped in his
ear, &quot;anybody can see us-&quot; 

&quot;So?&quot; 

She pushed away from him and, smiling
sweetly, said, &quot;Let's at least go 
inside.&quot; 

4. 

By the time he followed her into the
bedroom, his cock was already so 
hard, it felt as if it was exploding out of his jeans. She gave a small 
cry of pleasurable shock as he grabbed her arm and twirled her around to 
him until her back pressed up against his chest and her ass against his 
crotch. He pulled up on her shirt until he managed to get his hands 
under the fabric and he wrapped them his arms around her warm belly, 
squeezing her and inhaling the fragrance of her hair. Slowly, she kicked 
off her shoes. 

&quot;Jeff,&quot; she gasped,
&quot;what do you want to do?&quot; 

&quot;What do you want me to
do?&quot; 

&quot;I want you to fuck me.&quot; 

Something about the sound of her
sweet, almost innocent voice, uttering 
the word &quot;fuck&quot; in the heat of passion - it
did it to him everytime. He 
twirled her out of his grasp and she gracefully landed on the bed. She 
propped herself up and pulled her shirt off over her head, revealing her 
bountiful breasts held up by her green brassiere. She unbuttoned the top 
button and then unzipped her jeans and raised up her
hips to allow Jeff 
to pull them off. When she was clad only in her underwear, she fell back 
onto the bed, her breasts softly bouncing as she did so. 

The expression on her face was one of
pure lust. &quot;Please, Jeff - fuck 
me.&quot; 

Quickly, Jeff undressed, leaving his
clothes scattered across the room. 
He slipped off his boxers, allowing his nine inch erection to spring to 
life, pointing towards Catherine's pussy like a heat seeking missile. He 
climbed onto the bed and soon, he was holding his body over Catherine's. 
He lowered himself down to kiss her mouth. As his cock rubbing against 
her moist cotton panties, she bit into his lower lip and sent a pain 
through his body that only aroused him more. She arched up her back to 
allow him to reach underneath and unhook her brassiere which he greedily 
pulled off her, freeing her magnificent breasts. He lowered his mouth 
onto her right nipple, sucking on it until it was red and hard and, 
almost pleading, she gasped, &quot;Kiss me, Jeff. Kiss me-down there.&quot; 

Still sucking on her breasts, he
reached down and, with her help, ripped 
down on her blue panties, yanking them down to her knees and then 
letting her kick them off. Slowly, he ran his tongue down her body, over 
her breasts, over her belly button, and down over her dark pubes. He 
rolled his tongue over her clit for a few minutes and he inhaled deeply, 
taking in the smell of her pussy. Jeff loved the way pussy smelled - so 
dirty, yet so real. Finally, as she spread her legs, he placed his lips 
of over her hole and licked the wet inside of her pussy. 

&quot;Oh God, Jeff,&quot; she said,
&quot;please, please fuck me now...&quot; 

Her pussy was hot and wet and it
seemed to suck his cock right into her. 
Entering her was always his favorite part of fucking her - she always 
gave off a small yell of pleasure, her reserved facade crumbling as he 
rammed his huge cock into her body. Once he was in her, he thrust back 
and forth as she wrapped her legs around his back. Their sweat-bathed 
bodies pressed together as he continued jamming into her and her entire 
body shook with each thrust of his cock. Behind her glasses, her eyelids 
fluttered open and shut with pleasure. She was making the high pitched 
squeals he only heard whenever he was inside her and he knew he was the 
only man to have heard those squeals. He kept thrusting into her until 
she let out an almost anguished scream that let him know she had an 
orgasm. That scream always got him off. He finally came inside her and 
he felt his juices spurting out of his cock and into her. 

She unwrapped
her legs and her arms fell to her side in exhaustion. He 
slid his cock out of her and then rolled off her - their sweat-sealed 
bellies made a loud THWOCK as they separated. Lying beside her, he 
looked over as she took off her glasses and, still gasping, started to 
wipe off the steam-covered lenses. 

Finally, he started,
&quot;Well-&quot; 

Before he could finish his thought,
she suddenly jumped out of bed and, 
completely nude, ran from the bedroom and into the bathroom, closing the 
door behind her. 

&quot;Catherine!&quot; he shouted
after her. 

From inside the bathroom, he could
hear her pressing down on her asthma 
inhaler. 

Good sex always gave her an asthma
attack. 

5. 

The next afternoon, Jeff and Matt
went down to the Mayland Community 
Theater to help paint the sets for an upcoming production of a Streetcar 
Named Desire. In between, they stepped out to the theater's back alley 
and smoked a cigarette. 

&quot;So, what did you guys do last
night?&quot; Matt asked. 

Thinking about a nude Catherine
running for her inhaler, Jeff smiled to 
himself and said, &quot;Not much.&quot; 

&quot;Sorry to hear that,&quot; Matt
smirked, &quot;What did you think of Joey?&quot; 

&quot;She seemed nice.&quot; 

&quot;That's not what I'm asking,
man. Let me tell you something about that 
girl-&quot; Matt leaned towards Jeff and whispered, &quot;That girl is perfect.
I 
mean - she is, like, addicted to giving head. I mean, when she sucks my 
dick-&quot; 

&quot;Matt,&quot; Jeff cut him off,
&quot;that's more than I need to know-&quot; 

&quot;She swallows, too. Can you
believe that? She doesn't make you put on 
some fucking rubber, she doesn't make you pull out, and she doesn't 
spit. What do you think of that?&quot; 

&quot;I think that's more than I need
to know.&quot; 

&quot;You guys are such prudes.&quot;


&quot;What do you mean 'guys?'&quot; 

&quot;You and Catherine,&quot; Matt
snorted, &quot;I mean, shit, buddy, when was the 
last time Catherine sucked your dick? I mean - has she ever sucked your 
dick?&quot; 

Jeff smiled nervously. &quot;I don't
have to prove anything to you-' 

&quot;Hey, she's a sweet girl. I'm
not saying a thing against Catherine. But 
sometimes a man need something more than sweet. And
you know I'm right.&quot; 

Before Jeff could answer, they heard
a female voice behind them say, 
&quot;Hey, look - its the theater faggots.&quot; 

Jeff and Matt turned around. The Goth
girl was walking down the alley. 
&quot;The Goth Girl&quot; was the name a few members of the MCT had given to a 
teenage girl who apparently lived in the alley behind the theater. She 
was a small, waifish girl who was somewhere between
fourteen and sixteen 
years old. She had pale, deathly white skin with an apparently flat 
chest and straight, jet black hair that fell down to her ass. Her lips 
and her eyeliner were coal black. She wore a dog collar around her long, 
thin neck and a low-cut, almost transparent black dress that fell down 
to her knees and revealed the black slip she always wore underneath. She 
was barefoot and a black pentagram was tattooed on her right ankle. As 
usual, she had an expression of affected contempt across her face. 

&quot;Why don't you two get a
room?&quot; she said. 

&quot;Fuck you,&quot; Matt snapped
back. 

&quot;Ignore her,&quot; Jeff said. 

&quot;You couldn't fuck me,&quot; the
girl said. 

&quot;I could do whatever I fucking
want to you!&quot; Matt's voice rose. 

As the girl walked past the two men,
she said, &quot;My cunt has teeth.&quot; 

&quot;FUCK YOU, BITCH!&quot; Matt
screamed, holding up his middle finger. 

&quot;Jesus Christ, Matt,&quot; Jeff
said, &quot;calm down-&quot; 

&quot;I DON'T HAVE TO TAKE THAT SHIT
FROM THAT CUNT!&quot; 

The Goth Girl laughed as she turned
out of the alley and onto the 
street. 

&quot;Goddamn bitch!&quot; Matt said.


&quot;She's just a kid, Matt,&quot;
Jeff said. 

Again, Matt snorted. &quot;If she
keeps giving people shit, she's going to be 
a dead kid!&quot; 

With that, Matt tossed his cigarette
to the ground and reentered the 
theater. Jeff stood in the alley and sighed. It was a fucked up world. 

6. 

Two hours later, when Matt returned
to his one bedroom apartment, Joey 
London was half-naked. She was standing in front of the wall-length 
mirror Matt kept in the bedroom, admiring her body. She was wearing a 
red bra that held up her small but firm tits and small, white panties 
decorated with red hearts. An ex-boyfriend whose name she could barely 
remember had given them to her last Valentine's Day. Joey liked her body 
- she knew that every man who saw her athletically perk figure became 
turned on. She didn't have a lot in the world but she knew she was sexy. 
To be honest, Joey didn't like fucking that much. Most men didn't know 
what they were doing - they just shoved their cocks into her and got off 
while she faked a climax. Afterward, when they were either asleep or 
taking a shower or calling their wives, Joey would touch herself until 
she had the only orgasm that actually felt right to her - one that she 
had given herself. No, sex didn't excite her. It was the power. It was 
the fact that she could make a man hard just by smiling at him. 

She had been a cheerleader before she
had dropped out of school and she 
was still limber. She kicked forward her right leg and, leaning against 
the drawer, held it up as high as she could, admiring the sleek muscle 
tone of her thigh. Caught up in herself, she didn't hear Matt step into 
the apartment and she didn't notice him in the doorway of the bedroom, 
watching her. 

&quot;Joey,&quot; she muttered to her
reflection, &quot;you are so hot.&quot; 

Suddenly, a large hand roughly went
over her mouth and a rough voice 
hissed in her ear, &quot;Don't you fucking move, you bitch.&quot; 

Oh shit, she thought, Matt wants to
be a rapist again. It was one of 
Matt's fantasies and he demanded to act it out nearly every night. Joey 
didn't enjoy it but she usually went along if just to keep him whining 
or, even worse, kicking her out to the street. 

In fact, Joey hated playing rape. 

&quot;Do you know what I'm going to
do to you?&quot; Matt snapped at her. 

Trying to whimper fearfully, Joey
nodded. 

&quot;What am I going to do,
cunt?&quot; 

He moved his hand and allowed her to
scream out in her best anguished 
voice, &quot;PLEASE DON'T RAPE ME!&quot; 

&quot;SHUT UP, CUNT!&quot; 

He shoved her down onto the bed and
she landed on her stomach. 

&quot;BEG ME, BITCH!&quot; 

&quot;Please don't rape me...&quot;
she whimpered. 

&quot;BEG ME!&quot; 

&quot;please...&quot; 

&quot;CUNT!&quot; 

&quot;oh god...&quot; 

&quot;CUNT!&quot; 

Jesus, she thought, this is getting
tedious. &quot;please don't hurt 
me....i'll do anything....&quot; 

&quot;DO YOU KNOW WHERE I'M GOING TO
FUCK YOU, BITCH!?&quot; 

&quot;...god...&quot; she tried to
fake some tears but they weren't coming. 

&quot;God ain't got nothing to do
with this, cunt.&quot; 

Roughly, he grabbed her hips and
pulled her ass towards him. He grabbed 
the sides of her panties and roughly yanked down and Joey cringed as she 
heard them rip. 

Fuck, she thought, those were my
favorites. 

&quot;BEG ME! SCREAM!&quot; 

&quot;I can't scream...&quot; she
said, &quot;...I'm too scared...&quot; 

&quot;SCREAM!&quot; 

As Joey screamed, Matt unzipped his
jeans. He pulled out his erect but 
small cock and then said, &quot;I'm going to fuck you like you've never been 
fucked before, cunt.&quot; 

&quot;...god in heaven...no...&quot; 

&quot;SHUT UP, CUNT!&quot; 

He reached down and pulled apart the
cheeks of her ass. He shoved his 
tiny dick up her ass and started to rhythmically thrust into her anus. 
As Joey waited for him to finish, she could hear him gasping as he 
continued to call her a cunt. After five minutes, he came inside her and 
Joey could feel the small trickle of his discharge running down her 
inner thigh. Joey screamed out once to convince him he had actually done 
something for her. 

He pulled out his limp dick and said,
&quot;Thanks.&quot; 

She turned over onto her back and
looked up at him. 

&quot;Did you enjoy that?&quot; she
asked. 

He zipped up his jeans. &quot;You
bet, babe.&quot; 

&quot;Good. Now, go buy me some new
panties, you pervert.&quot; 

7. 

When Jeff returned home frustrated.
He knew that he and Catherine 
probably had better sex than Matt or anyone else at the MCT could even 
begin to dream about. He also knew that no one else would ever know it. 
People would look at Matt with girls like Joey and they would 
automatically assume he was having the fuck of his life later that 
night. They looked at Jeff and Catherine and would say, &quot;What a sweet 
couple,&quot; or &quot;Aren't they cute?&quot; but they'd never believe Jeff
Stern 
would be getting any that night. As much as he hated to admit it, that 
bugged the Hell out of him. 
When he stepped into their bedroom, Catherine was sitting on the bed, 
reading an English textbook. She was wearing a red sweater and blue 
jeans and she barely glanced up as Jeff entered. 

&quot;Hey,&quot; she said, &quot;how
are things down at the theater?&quot; 

Without a word, Jeff walked up to her
and took the textbook from her 
hands. He closed it and tossed it down to the floor. She looked up in 
surprise as he leaned forward and kissed her luscious lips. She kissed 
back as she caressed the back of his head. 

They broke their kiss apart but
continued to hold each other as she 
whispered in his ear, &quot;Did you miss me?&quot; 

&quot;Catherine,&quot; he said,
&quot;I need you.&quot; 

&quot;I need you, too.&quot; 

&quot;I want you.&quot; 

&quot;I want you too, Jeff.&quot; 

&quot;I want you to do
something.&quot; 

&quot;What do you want me to
do?&quot; 

Jeff hesitated, wondering how one
politely asked this. Finally, he 
decided to be crude and direct. 

&quot;I want,&quot; he paused,
&quot;I want you to suck my dick.&quot; 

Automatically, she let go of his head
and sat back on the bed. Not quite 
looking into his eyes, she started, &quot;Jeff-&quot; 

&quot;Catherine, please. I'll never
ask again.&quot; 

Her cheeks flushed red and she looked
away from him. &quot;Jeff,&quot; she said, 
&quot;you know I don't like to do that.&quot; 

He sat on the bed beside her.
&quot;Why not?&quot; 

&quot;Its just - its not me,&quot;
she said, &quot;Its not something Catherine Anderson 
does. I'm sorry - sometimes, I wish I could but - I can't.&quot; 

&quot;Catherine - I love you.&quot; 

&quot;And I love you. But - I mean,
you're the first guy I've ever been with, 
Jeff. Its not that easy for me. Its just - I can't. I'm sorry.&quot; 

&quot;I'm sorry I asked.&quot; 

&quot;Its just - my mother always
used to tell me something,&quot; Catherine 
looked over at him and, for the first time, Jeff saw the tears running 
from her eyes, &quot;She'd always tell me that once you start down a certain 
road, you can't turn off it until you reach the end. Do you understand 
what I mean?&quot; 

Jeff nodded. &quot;Yeah.&quot; 

&quot;Really?&quot; 

&quot;Yes-I'm sorry, Catherine.&quot;


She leaned forward and kissed his
cheek. 

&quot;I love you, Jeff,&quot; she
said. 

&quot;I love you, too.&quot; 

Suddenly, without another word, she
reached down and unzipped the fly of 
his jeans. She pulled out his erect cock and placed her lips on its 
head, giving it a kiss. Jeff could feel the juices rushing into his cock 
as Catherine opened her mouth. She placed her lips around the head and 
quickly took the entire shaft into her mouth. To Jeff's shock and 
embarrassment, he came almost immediately. 

Releasing him Catherine sat back up
and wiped the semen off her chin. 
She ran into the bathroom and in a few minutes, Jeff heard her spitting 
up. 

8. 

Two months later, on Valentine's Day,
Joey London was fucking with mall 
security. 

If she had any sexual fetish, it was
for herself. She loved her body and 
she loved standing in front of mirrors in various states of undress. 
Ever since she her first training bra, Joey had enjoyed staring at 
herself in her underwear. Being a small Southern Baptist Texas town, 
Mayland only had one mall and that mall only had one
place to shop for 
sexy underwear - the Lingerie Store. Joey made it a point to go to the 
store at least twice a week. Even though she couldn't afford much of 
what they had, she liked to look at the various undergarments and 
imagine them on her body. And she liked to go into the dressing rooms 
and try on various things, knowing she was being watched by some hidden 
security camera and some horny guard somewhere was probably jerking off 
to her. 

Valentine's Day was no different. She
was standing nude in the Lingerie 
Store's dressing room, looking at herself in a mirror. There was a tiny 
smirk on her face as she imagined Bubba the Mall Cop yanking and 
spanking his inbred dick. She ran her hands over her flat stomach, down 
to the auburn triangle of hair between her legs. 

Still smirking, she leaned forward to
pick her selections for the day up 
from the floor. With her ass in the air, she gave it a seductive shake, 
just to make Bubba wonder. She lifted her left leg as she slipped on 
some black satin panties. She then lifted her right leg and pulled them 
up over her pussy, enjoying the way the satin clung to her cunt. She 
then put on a black bra, carefully placing each pink-nippled
breast into 
each cup and then fastening it in back. 

She looked again at herself in the
mirror. 

Alright, Bubba, she thought, here's
your Valentine's gift. 

Slowly, she slid her right hand
underneath her panties and, as she 
touched herself, she gave off an exaggerated, almost campy gasp of 
ecstasy and threw her head and shoulders back, thrusting her tits 
forward. 

She removed her hand and then looked
straight into the mirror and 
smiled. 

&quot;Happy?&quot; she asked the
reflection. 

9. 

Ten minutes later, as Joey London
stepped out of the Lingerie Store, the 
first person she saw was Jeff Stern. He was standing in the middle of 
the crowded mall corridor, staring almost sheepishly at the Lingerie 
Store. In his hand, he held a bag from Waldenbooks. 

Joey smiled as she walked up to him.
&quot;Hey, Jeff.&quot; 

He jumped as he heard her voice as if
she was snapping him out of the 
most distant of thoughts. &quot;Hi, Joey,&quot; he said, nervously,
&quot;where'd you 
come from?&quot; 

&quot;Oh, I'm just doing a little
browsing.&quot; She glanced down at the bag in 
his hand and noticed the title of the book inside - The Love Poems of W. 
B. Yeats. 

How quaint, she thought. 

&quot;Are you shopping for
Catherine?&quot; she asked. 

&quot;Yeah,&quot; he nodded - God,
his voice was so nervous. Joey had to smile. 

Joey glanced over at the Lingerie
Store and then back to Jeff. &quot;And let 
me guess,&quot; she said, &quot;you're thinking about something that could be a

gift for you as well.&quot; 

Jeff's cheeks turned red as he said,
&quot;Well, yes-&quot; 

&quot;You feeling shy?&quot; 

&quot;What?&quot; 

&quot;Are you feeling shy? Do you
need my help?&quot; 

&quot;Well-&quot; 

&quot;Follow me.&quot; 

Firmly, Joey took Jeff's hand and led
him into the Lingerie Store. 

10. 

As they stepped into the store, Jeff
noticed that all the sales clerks 
(female all) rolled their eyes at the sight of Joey. It was true that 
Joey wasn't exactly dressed for success - she was wearing a white tank 
top that hung low on her breasts and tight white shorts imprinted with 
the outline of her thong panties. As Jeff followed behind her, he 
couldn't help watch the firm, sexy movement of her ass and he knew he 
was probably getting far too obviously aroused. Fuck it - he loved 
Catherine and Matt was his best friend but he couldn't deny that Joey 
London was a sexy lady. 

From behind a counter, a tall blonde
wearing a black dress said, &quot;Did 
you forget something?&quot; 

&quot;No,&quot; Joey smiled even as
her voice was catty, &quot;I just decided to come 
back earlier than usual.&quot; 

She turned to Jeff and whispered,
&quot;That's Lisa. She's a snobby bitch so 
let's find a different sales clerk. What are you looking to get for 
Catherine?&quot; 

Jeff shrugged. &quot;Y'know -
underwear.&quot; 

&quot;God,&quot; Joey smiled,
&quot;men always think these things are so simple. You 
want bras, panties, teddies, dominatrix gear - what?&quot; 

&quot;No dominatrix gear.&quot; 

&quot;Not your thing?&quot; 

&quot;Afraid not.&quot; 

&quot;Never knock something 'til you
try it,&quot; Joey replied. 

&quot;Bras and panties,&quot; Jeff
said. 

&quot;What size bra?&quot; 

&quot;36 D.&quot; 

Joey looked incredulous. &quot;36
D?&quot; 

&quot;Yeah...&quot; 

She shrugged. &quot;She carries it
well. Most girls that big always look like 
they're about to fall over. I'm happy with my B Cup.&quot; 

From behind the counter, Lisa said,
&quot;Well, what can I help you two 
find?&quot; 

Joey leaned over to Jeff and her
breasts briefly brushed against his 
arm. &quot;Leave this to me,&quot; she whispered before walking to Lisa. 

As Jeff watched, Joey leaned across
the counter and talked to Lisa. 
Staring at the two of them, an image suddenly flashed through Jeff's 
head. Joey and Lisa. Naked in a jacuzzi. Licking whip
cream off each 
other. JESUS CHRIST, WHAT WAS WRONG WITH HIM!? It was Valentine's, he 
was getting underwear for the woman he loved, and all he could think 
about what his best friend's girl fucking some snooty sales clerk. 

Lisa nodded and then went to the back
storeroom. Joey walked back to 
Jeff and said, &quot;She hates me because I always come in here and I never 
buy anything.&quot; 

Jeff looked over at her and smiled.
He could see down the front of her 
top and indiscreetly, he scanned the top of her tits - a little small 
for him but still nice... 

Lisa stepped out of the storeroom,
carrying a black bra and a pair of 
black thong panties. 

&quot;Is this what you wanted?&quot;
Lisa asked. 

&quot;Catherine doesn't wear
thongs...&quot; Jeff started. 

&quot;She'll love it,&quot; Joey cut
him off. &quot;Fuck me.&quot; 

Jeff looked over at her, surprised.
What had she just said? 

Joey smiled at him and repeated,
&quot;Trust me.&quot; 

11. 

After Jeff purchased the underwear,
Joey asked if he wanted to get lunch 
with her. He agreed, even volunteering to pay. Joey smiled as he offered 
- men were always willing to pay for her. 

As they ate a lunch of Mexican food,
Joey said, &quot;So, how did Catherine 
and you end up together?&quot; 

Jeff shrugged. &quot;We were in a
play together. One thing led to another.&quot; 

Joey nodded. &quot;I just have a hard
time imagining you two together.&quot; 

Shocked, Jeff laughed. &quot;What do
you mean?&quot; 

&quot;Catherine seems so - well,
don't get me wrong. She seems like a sweet 
girl but - well, I don't want to make things awkward.&quot; 

&quot;Well, how did you and Matt get
together?&quot; 

Joey sighed. &quot;Shit, I guess I
brought this on myself.&quot; 

&quot;That good a story, huh?&quot; 

&quot;Look, I had been in Mayland for a week and I didn't have any place to 
live,&quot; Joey shrugged, &quot;You have to understand - I tend to move around
in 
a hurry. I met Matt in a bar and we started talking and he offered to 
let me move in. The rest, as they say is history.&quot; 

Jeff nodded as he started to feel
distinctively uncomfortable. He 
wondered what Catherine would say about this - well, he could guess. 
Finally, he said, &quot;I see.&quot; 

&quot;I know that makes me sound like
a whore.&quot; 

&quot;Not necessarily-&quot; 

&quot;No, it does,&quot; Joey smiled,
sadly, &quot;Maybe I am in whore. I know that. 
Listen, Jeff, you're a sweet guy so let me tell you something. This is 
the most important thing you'll ever hear. You ready for it?&quot; 

There was something intense in her
eyes and Jeff couldn't look away from 
her. &quot;I'm ready.&quot; 

&quot;There's only one terrible thing
in the world, Jeff,&quot; Joey said, &quot;you 
know what that is? Everyone's got their own good reasons.&quot; 

Sweetly, she smiled at him and then
stood up and walked away. Jeff 
watched the hypnotic sway of her ass and suddenly, he felt very guilty. 

12. 

That evening, when Catherine stepped
through the front door and dropped 
her collection of textbooks to the floor, she yelled out, &quot;Jeff, I'm 
home!&quot; 

Silence. 

&quot;Jeff!?&quot; 

Silence. 

She looked around the living room and
saw a small note sitting on the 
coffee table. She read it. 

&quot;You've got fifteen minutes to
get ready. I left something for you 
outside the bedroom.&quot; 

Catherine put the note down and
quickly went up stairs to the bedroom. 
Sitting in front of the closed door was a plain brown box. She knelt 
down and lifted up the led and, almost despite herself, smiled when she 
saw the black underwear waiting for her. 

&quot;God, Jeff,&quot; she muttered,
&quot;you have got such a one track mind.&quot; 

Still, she wasn't disappointed. She
reached into the box and took out 
the bra. According to the tag in bag, it was her size but the cups were 
padded. She ran her finger across the padding and then looked down at 
the front of her gray shirt and the impression of her ample breasts 
trying to break free. Jesus, the last thing in the world she needed was 
padding - then again, Jeff was a guy. What did he know about buying 
lady's underwear? 

She then pulled out the panties and
held the thong up to the light. 

&quot;Jesus,&quot; she said, &quot;is
this underwear or dental floss?&quot; 

She hated thongs, hated the way they
rode up her ass. She knew Jeff 
liked them but Jeff never actually had to wear them. 

Still... 

She stared at the thong for a minute
and a sly smile came to her face. 

13. 

Fifteen minutes later, when Jeff
knocked on the apartment's front door, 
he was wearing a suit and tie and holding a bouquet of roses in his 
hands. 

When the door opened, Catherine stood
in the doorway and smiled. &quot;You 
better be careful, Mr. Stern, or else my boyfriend's going to start to 
suspect something's going on.&quot; 

She was wearing a tight, red dress,
the skirt of which fell halfway down 
her thighs. With her hair teased and her face fully made up, she was 
breathtakingly beautiful and Jeff didn't know what to say. 

Finally, he said, &quot;You look
great.&quot; 

She looked down at the roses.
&quot;Are those for me?&quot; 

&quot;Yeah.&quot; 

&quot;Can I have them?&quot; 

&quot;Oh, sorry.&quot; 

He handed her the flowers. She
sniffed them and smiled. 

&quot;Did you get my present?&quot;
he asked. 

&quot;Oh yes,&quot; a small smile
came to her lips, &quot;I got them.&quot; 

&quot;What-&quot; 

&quot;What did I think? You'll find
out soon enough, Mr. Stern. I'm going to 
put the flowers in water.&quot; 

She turned around and strode into the
kitchen. Standing in the doorway, 
Jeff watched her backside move underneath the velvet of her dress, 
wondering if she was wearing his gift. As she turned the corner and 
entered the corner, she gave her ass a sultry shake. 

Jeff smiled to himself. &quot;Happy
Valentine's Day.&quot; 

14. 

They had dinner at Bari's and afterward, Jeff and Catherine went to the 
Royal Motel - a small, cheap motel that sat out on the edge of the 
highway leading out of Mayland. It was something they
did regularly 
before moving in together. Walking behind Catherine as they headed to 
their room, Jeff felt like he had gone back in time, when every move 
with her had promised a new discovery. 

When they entered the dark room, Jeff
grabbed her from behind and turned 
her to him. As he kissed her, he ran his hands over clothed breasts. 
Gently but firmly, she pushed him away. 

She smiled at him. &quot;Eager, Mr.
Stern?&quot; 

Jeff smiled. &quot;Are you wearing my
gifts?&quot; 

&quot;You know I don't wear
thongs.&quot; 

Jeff's smiled disappeared. &quot;Oh.
Couldn't you make on exception-&quot; 

As he spoke, Catherine climbed up on
the bed and, standing with her back 
to him, hiked up her skirt to reveal that she wasn't wearing any panties 
at all. The sight of her bare ass, the fact that she hadn't been wearing 
underwear the whole night and he'd never realized - it all caused Jeff 
to lose his voice as all of his thoughts were overwhelmed by animal 
lust. He unzipped his fly and pulled out his stiff cock. He jumped up on 
the bed and, wrapping his arms around her waist, he penetrated her wet 
pussy from behind. Catherine let out a pleasured gasp as she fell to the 
bed. Jeff pounded himself into her, her cunt consuming his dick like 
some ravenous beast. He pumped himself into her as she loudly fought for 
breath and, when she could speak, begged him to fuck her harder and 
harder. Jeff kept pounding into her until he heard her scream out in 
climax and he felt his juices explode into her. 

&quot;Oh God, Jeff...&quot; she said.


He rolled off her and ran his hand
through his sweat matted hair. 

&quot;Oh Jesus,&quot; he muttered
under his breath, &quot;I love you, Joey...&quot; 

SHIT! He sat up and looked over at
her, lying on her stomach and still 
breathing hard. Had she heard him? Oh fuck.... 

&quot;God, Jeff...&quot; she gasped
again, &quot;I love you.&quot; 

He kissed the back of her head and
said, &quot;I love you, Catherine.&quot; 

Suddenly, she jumped out of the bed
and ran into the hotel's bathroom. 
Cursing, Jeff fell back onto the bed. Why had he said Joey's name? He 
loved Catherine. He wanted to fuck Joey but he wanted make love to 
Catherine...fuck...and now, she was in the bathroom...pissed.... 

Suddenly, he heard the sound
Catherine sucking on her inhaler. Relieved, 
he smiled. 
Asthma attack. 

He was safe. She hadn't heard Joey's
name. She wasn't mad. 

She was just having her after sex
asthma attack. 

15. 

While Jeff was accidentally gasping
her name, Joey London spent her 
Valentine's Day with a blindfold over her eyes. Matt had her sit in an 
uncomfortable wooden chair while he tied her hands behind her with rough 
twine that cut into her skin and hurt and aroused her at the same time. 
He made her spread her legs so he could stare up her skirt and her 
flaming red panties. When he ordered her to piss on herself, she did so 
and listened as he jerked himself off, high on his power. And as he 
hissed, &quot;You're a fucking cunt, aren't you?&quot; in her ear, she wondered
if 
a rent-free apartment was really worth having to endure this bullshit. 
And after he lightly slapped her a few times, he proceeded to rip off 
her blouse and, using scissors, he cut the straps off her purple bra, 
allowing the cups to fall free from her tits. He sucked on her nipples 
like a newborn baby and then held her close and cried as he told her she 
was the first woman he had ever loved. 

&quot;I love you too, Matt,&quot;
Joey whispered back, &quot;Now untie me.&quot; 

To her relief, he actually did so and
was actually gentle as he caressed 
her in their bed. He went to sleep resting his head on her right boob 
and she ran her hands through his hair and actually found herself 
envying Catherine Anderson - even if she wasn't living a life of 
adventure, at least she had a halfway stable boyfriend. 
Up until a few months ago, Joey London would have said she had no 
interest in stability, that she enjoyed pushing every limit, whether it 
be fucking another woman or letting some stranger shoot heroin into her 
veins. Just recently, she would have said that if she was going to have 
to die eventually, she might as well die when she still was a hot piece 
of ass. 

But as she looked down at the rope
burns on her wrists, all she could do 
was mournfully say, &quot;You can't keep living like this, Joey. You
can't.&quot; 

She looked down at Matt and said,
&quot;I'm sorry, Matt.&quot; 

He started to snore. 

16. 

Catherine and Jeff took a shower
together and then lay in bed and 
cuddled. She fell asleep with her arms around his neck, her nude body 
pressed into his. It was the way they had both always fantasized about 
falling asleep together except that Jeff couldn't sleep. He couldn't 
stop thinking about how he had nearly said Joey's name. Joey London had 
been on his mind ever since that first night at Bari's.
He loved 
Catherine but Joey - JESUS! What was wrong with him? 

Something in Joey London's eyes.
There was a sadness there and for some 
reason, that always drew Jeff in. He wanted to discover where that 
incredible sadness was coming from and he wanted to be the one to help 
solve it. 

Finally, after two hours of trying to
fall asleep, Jeff gently slid 
Catherine's head off his chest and gently lay it onto the pillow. He 
heard her mutter loving words in her sleep and felt like shit. 

He got out of bed and quickly
dressed. He needed to walk outside. 

He needed to think. 

17. 

&quot;FUCKING BITCH!&quot; 

Jeff heard the rough, male voice
coming from a red pickup truck parked 
out in the motel parking lot. 

&quot;Its not my fault!&quot; a girl's
voice shouted back. 

&quot;SHUT UP! I'LL FUCKING KILL
YOU!&quot; 

The passenger side door to the truck
opened and, as Jeff watched, the 
Goth Girl from outside the theater, dressed in her trademark black 
dress, fell onto the hard pavement. A rough-looking, bearded man with a 
pot belly stepped out after her and stood over the Goth Girl. The zipper 
of his jeans were down. 

&quot;Fuck you!&quot; the Goth Girl
yelled. 

&quot;YOU CUNT! YOU FUCKING
CUNT!&quot; 

Suddenly, the Goth Girl yelled,
&quot;HELP!&quot; 

&quot;SHUT UP!&quot; 

Jeff quickly walked towards the two,
yelling, &quot;Hey!&quot; as he approached. 

The man looked at Jeff and said,
&quot;This doesn't fucking concern you...&quot; 

&quot;What the Hell's going on?&quot;
Jeff demanded. 

The Goth Girl stared up at him - her
face streaked with tears of black 
mascara. 
&quot;He said he'd give me fifty bucks to suck his dick,&quot; the Goth Girl
said, 
&quot;but he can't get it up.&quot; 

&quot;Shut up, you cunt!&quot; the
man snapped. Then, to Jeff: &quot;I suggest you move 
on, buddy. This is between me and her.&quot; 

&quot;Its not her fault you can't get
it up,&quot; Jeff replied. 

&quot;You looking to start some
shit?&quot; 

Jeff shrugged. &quot;Maybe.&quot; 

The two men glared at each other as
the Goth Girl remained prone on the 
cement, slowly managing to hold back her sobs. 

Suddenly, the man's fist came
forward. Jeff ducked out of the way and, 
as if he was in a dream, he felt his own fist make contact with the 
man's nose with a loud crack. The man staggered back, holding his bloody 
nose. 

&quot;YOU BROKE MY FUCKING
NOSE!&quot; the man shouted. 

Jeff stared at him in shock - how the
fuck had he pulled that off. 

Finally, Jeff said, &quot;Unless you
want me to do worse...&quot; 

&quot;I'm calling the cops!&quot; the
man cut him off. 

&quot;Go ahead,&quot; Jeff smirked,
&quot;I'm protecting a young lady. You're the poor 
impotent bastard who has to pay to get a blow job.&quot; 

&quot;Fuck you.&quot; 

Still holding his bleeding nose, the
man climbed into his truck and sped 
away. 
The Goth Girl slowly stood up and looked over at Jeff. 

&quot;Jesus,&quot; she said,
&quot;how did you do that? How did you break his nose?&quot; 

Jeff looked down at his hands - they
were stained with the man's blood 
but they weren't shaking with rage or nerves. They were dead calm. 

&quot;I don't know,&quot; Jeff said. 

The Goth Girl stared at Jeff and then
suddenly looked away. &quot;Listen,&quot; 
she asked, &quot;I'm hungry. Can you buy me something to eat?&quot; 

Jeff kept staring at his hands - he
barely heard her voice. 

The Goth Girl pleaded,
&quot;Please?&quot; 

Jeff looked up at her. &quot;Why were
you with him?&quot; 

&quot;I need the money, okay? Please,
man - I'm hungry.&quot; 

Jeff looked at her. The Goth Girl's
eyes were so sad. 

&quot;What's your name?&quot; Jeff
asked. 

&quot;None of your business-&quot;
she started. 

&quot;You want me to buy you food?
Then you tell me your name.&quot; 

The Goth Girl looked down at the
ground and then back at Jeff. &quot;Lenore,&quot; 
she said, &quot;Call me Lenore.&quot; 

Jeff nodded. &quot;Well, Lenore - let's
get some food.&quot; 

18. 
There was an open 24-hours International House of Pancakes across the 
street from the motel. Jeff and Lenore got a seat in the back of the 
smoking section and while Lenore ordered and then ravenously devoured a 
huge bacon, egg, and pancake breakfast, Jeff sipped from a cup of 
coffee. 

Finally, Lenore looked up at him and
said, &quot;So, is there were you start 
preaching?&quot; 
Jeff smiled. &quot;I'm just drinking my coffee.&quot; 

&quot;Save your breath,&quot; Lenore
continued, &quot;I've already had all the 
preaching in the world. My father was a preacher.&quot; 

&quot;Oh yeah?&quot; 

&quot;Yeah,&quot; she said, her voice
unemotional, &quot;He'd spend every Sunday 
morning fucking people out of their cash and then he'd spend every 
Sunday night just fucking me for free.&quot; 

The coldness of her voice caught Jeff
off guard and he said, &quot;Are you 
telling me the truth?&quot; 

&quot;No, I'm making it up,&quot;
Lenore said, her voice sarcastic, &quot;I think its 
really cool to pretend that my Daddy used to rape me.&quot; 

Jeff didn't know what to say.
&quot;I'm - I'm sorry.&quot; 

&quot;Yeah, so am I,&quot; Lenore
shrugged, &quot;So, I started dressing like a ghoul 
just to piss him off. Of course, all it did was turn him on even more. 
Now, he had to discipline me and he loved that. So, I ran away from home 
and now, I don't know who he's fucking.&quot; 

&quot;Don't you have anywhere to
go-&quot; 

&quot;If I have to choose between a)
starving outside that fucking theater or 
b) going back to that bastard-&quot; Lenore paused and then said, &quot;-well, 
let's just say sometimes you say that sometimes a girl has to go with 
Plan C - no matter how much she hates it.&quot; 

&quot;But Lenore-&quot; 

&quot;Oh shit,&quot; Lenore said,
standing up, &quot;here comes the preaching.&quot; 

&quot;Just listen to me-&quot; 

&quot;I don't want to listen to you.
I mean, thanks for the food - maybe I'll 
make it up to you someday if I can but that still doesn't mean I have to 
listen to you preach.&quot; 

&quot;But-&quot; 

Lenore turned around and walked out
of the restaurant. 

Watching her leave, Jeff let out a
discouraged sigh. Joey London, Lenore 
- shit, there were a lot of sad people out there. 

&quot;You can't save them all,
Jeff,&quot; he muttered, &quot;Can't save them all.&quot; 

19. 
Three days later, the Mayland Community Theater held
auditions for its 
upcoming production of William Shakespeare's Julius Caesar. Directing 
the play was a newcomer to the theater - a 30ish woman named Veronica Sanders. 
Despite having thick brown hair and a really nice pair of tits, Veronica was 
a self-proclaimed lesbian who saw the play as a terrific example of 
man's naturally murderous and violent ways. 
Neither Jeff nor Matt cared to audition for the sexy woman they called 
&quot;God's Worst Dyke Joke&quot; but they were both talked into it by their 
respective girlfriends. Catherine thought it was great to have a chance 
to finally work with a female director. Joey thought Veronica had a pretty 
nice ass and reminded her of the woman she had shared her first lesbian 
&quot;experiment&quot; with. With Matt's continual demands, sometimes Joey
thought 
returning to the wonderful world of lesbianism might not be such a bad 
decision. 

To Jeff and Matt's strong irritation,
neither was cast in a lead role. 
Instead, they both got to play nameless conspirators who got to plunge 
their knives into Caesar and then presumably died off stage. Jeff 
thought the role was way too small for him to have to put up being 
directed by a woman who continually talked about how much penises 
disgusted her. Matt, however, was happy because he got to handle a real 
knife for the role. Veronica Sanders wanted realism - hence, only the main 
conspirators, the ones that would actually be seen killing Caesar, used 
fake theater knives. The rest of the conspirators, Jeff included, were 
wielding actual butcher knives. 
One night, during rehearsals, Matt walked up to Jeff backstage and held 
up his gleaming knife. 

&quot;You know what I just
realized?&quot; Matt asked. 

Jeff looked over at the knife.
&quot;You do realize Freud would say that's a 
phallic symbol?&quot; 

&quot;I should play Norman Bates in
the remake of Psycho. Not that Vince 
Vaughn.&quot; 

Matt laughed and then, yelling,
&quot;MOTHER, BLOOD! BLOOD!&quot; he ran off to 
terrorize a few stagehands. 

Catherine got a much bigger role -
she played Caesar's wife Calpurnia 
and even got to cry on cue as she talked about her prophetic nightmare 
in which Roman Citizen bathed in her husband's blood. Everyone agreed it 
was the best performance Catherine had even given and Jeff had to agree. 
He also had to agree that she looked damn good in a toga. Even Matt, who 
tended to politely dismiss Catherine as a prude, agreed to that. 

As for Joey London, everyone agreed
she gave a terrible audition and 
when she went home afterward, she actually cried. However, Matt would be 
a major pain in the ass if she wasn't cast and so Veronica reluctantly gave 
her a silent role. Joey played a prostitute who watched Caesar's murder. 
While Jeff, Matt, and ten others pretended to stab Caesar, Joey and 
another actress, Rachel Mattson, would cower in a corner while wearing 
only sheer belly dancer costumes. 

&quot;T and A!&quot; Veronica
explained it one night to Catherine and Jeff, &quot;Gotta
give 
the man what they want.&quot; 

And while Catherine rolled her eyes,
Jeff silently thought to himself 
that maybe Veronica wasn't so clueless after all. 

Every night, after rehearsals, Jeff
and Catherine would go out with Matt 
and Joey and have a few beers. (Well, Catherine didn't drink but the 
other three more than made up for it.) While Matt made crude jokes, Joey 
would be even cruder and when Jeff laughed, he was only barely aware of 
Catherine glaring beside him. 

After two months of rehearsals, they
went into performance. Everyone in 
the theater agreed it was one of their weaker recent plays but the 
audiences seemed to love it. Especially on the third night when during 
curtain bow, Joey London's left tit fell out of her costume and she 
smiled as she tucked it back in. 

Afterward, on the way back to the
apartment, Catherine said, &quot;She did 
that on purpose.&quot; 

Jeff laughed. &quot;You're being
paranoid. You think she's actually flash 
half of Mayland on purpose?&quot; 

Catherine looked over at him.
&quot;What is it you guys see in that whore?&quot; 

Jeff shrugged. &quot;Maybe that she
only looks like a whore. Inside, there's 
something else.&quot; 

Catherine didn't respond back.
Needless to say, Jeff Stern didn't get 
any that night. 

20. 
On the next-to-final night of the performance, Catherine stayed in the 
girl's dressing room after the end of the show. A small room, the walls 
were lined with mirrors and counters for placing makeup. A door on the 
left wall led to a small bathroom. Catherine always felt strange in that 
dressing room - it was so small and far away from the stage that it made 
her feel like she was in a different building and usually, it scared 
her. But tonight, she had other things on her mind. She waited until all 
the other actresses had changed and left and then she slipped off her 
toga and stared at her body. 

She couldn't wear a bra with the
costume so she was nude except for her 
cream white panties. She hated wearing white panties. First every girl 
wore white panties, it seemed. Second of all, she had extremely dark 
pubic hair and she could always see the shadow through the material and 
the vulgarness of it made her feel dirty. But, any
other panties with 
that white toga would have been visible to the audience so she wore the 
white panties and hoped no one looked at her crotch. 

She stared at her body. She wasn't
ugly. She wasn't some super model 
with an eating disorder but the fullness of her curves suggested a 
ripeness, as if her sexuality was some piece of fruit just waiting to be 
plucked. In many ways, Jeff had plucked that fruit - he had been her 
first lover and had even kept his head when she panicked at the sight of 
blood running down her inner thigh. He could be gentle, even tender but 
he could also be wild whenever she felt like a good pounding fuck. Oh 
yes, she had no illusions - often times, she and Jeff made love but a 
lot of other times, they were fucking pure and simple. 

But sometimes - sometimes she
wondered if she could handle only one 
lover for life. She was hot - she could attract other men and sometimes, 
she wondered if she was assuming too much with Jeff. 

Suddenly, she heard a toilet flush
and Joey London stepped out of the 
bathroom. She was wearing a black push-up bra and black thong panties - 
nearly identical to the outfit that Jeff had given Catherine for 
Valentine's. 

Hmmm, Catherine thought, Jeff and
Matt have similar tastes. Should that 
worry me? 

Joey looked at Catherine and said,
&quot;Wow.&quot; 

Embarrassed, Catherine moved her
hands over her full breasts. 

&quot;I thought I was alone,&quot;
she said, looking around for her clothes. 

&quot;You have got a great
body,&quot; Joey said, walking up to her. &quot;Why do you 
hide it?&quot; 

&quot;I-I don't hide it.&quot; 

&quot;Move your hands.&quot; 

&quot;What?&quot; 

&quot;I want to see your boobs,&quot;
Joey smiled. She gently took Catherine's 
hands and lowered them to her side. 

Joey looked her over and said,
&quot;I wish I had tits like yours.&quot; 

Catherine smiled, nervous.
&quot;Well, thanks...&quot; 

&quot;Jeff's a lucky man,&quot; Joey
said. 

Joey then went over to a corner and
grabbed a small orange dress. She 
slipped it on quickly as Catherine grabbed her teal bra and slipped her 
breasts into each cup. 

Suddenly, she felt a soft hand on her
back. 

&quot;Let me help you,&quot; Joey
said, fastening the back of the bra. 

&quot;Uh, thanks...&quot; Catherine
said. 

&quot;Least a girl can do.&quot; 

Joey smiled and then kissed
Catherine's cheek. Catherine felt a rush of 
excitement surge through her body. 

&quot;I'll see you later,&quot; Joey
said before turning around and walking out of 
the dressing room. 

Catherine placed her hand up to her
chest - her heart felt like it was 
about to explode. Suddenly, she realized her panties were damp. She was 
wet. Joey London had made her wet. 

Wetter than she ever got with Jeff. 

21. 
As Joey drove back to the apartment (Matt had already headed back), she 
allowed herself to fantasize. What would it be like - a threesome with 
Jeff and Catherine? She wanted to fuck Jeff she knew that. She probably 
never would because she would hate to lose his friendship but in her 
mind, she sometimes imagined giving him everything Matt claimed 
Catherine couldn't. But seeing Catherine in the dressing room - there 
was something more to her and suddenly, Joey was very interested in 
discovering just how much was waiting to burst out. 

As she stepped into the apartment,
her plan was simple. She would tell 
Matt that it was over, load her stuff into her car, and then drive over 
to Jeff and Catherine's and blow their minds. 

However, as she opened the door, the
first thing she heard was Matt 
yelling, &quot;SUCK IT, CUNT!&quot; 

Matt was nude in the kitchenette, his
back against the refrigerator. 
Joey's fellow Julius Caesar hooker, Rachel Mattson was also naked. She 
was kneeling down in front of him and she had Matt's inadequate little 
dick in her mouth. 

&quot;WHO IS YOUR FUCKING
DADDY!?&quot; Matt yelled. 

&quot;Matt?&quot; Joey said staring
at them. 

Matt looked up and smiled. &quot;Hey,
babe - you want to join in?&quot; 

Joey stared at him. She had been
planning to dump him, planning on a 
threesome herself but those were her plans - he wasn't supposed to be 
making plans of his own. 

&quot;FUCK YOU, MATT!&quot; Joey
shouted. 

She walked out of the apartment,
slamming the door behind her. 

His cock still in her mouth, Rachel
managed to ask, &quot;Should I stop?&quot; 

&quot;KEEP SUCKING, CUNT!&quot; Matt
screamed back. 

Joey would be back. Shit, he thought
as Rachel ran his tongue over the 
head of his penis, where else was she going to go? 

22. 
When the phone rang, Jeff and Catherine were lying in bed together. 
There was an awkward silence between them because they were both 
wondering what it would be like to fuck Joey London. 

Luckily, the phone rang. Jeff said,
&quot;I'll get it!&quot; and jumped out of 
bed. He ran downstairs and answered on the fifth ring. 

&quot;Hello?&quot; he said. 

On the other end of the phone, he
heard a woman sobbing. 

&quot;Hello?&quot; Jeff repeated. 

&quot;Jeff, this is Joey...&quot; 

&quot;What's wrong?&quot; 

&quot;I'm sorry - I didn't know who
else to call.&quot; 

Jeff was quiet for a minute and then
said, &quot;What did Matt do?&quot; 

&quot;I'm at the theater, Jeff. Could
you please come down here?&quot; 

&quot;Yeah, sure-&quot; 

&quot;Come alone, okay?&quot; She was
still crying, &quot;I mean, don't even bring 
Catherine, okay?&quot; 

&quot;Yeah, I'll come alone,&quot;
Jeff said, &quot;I'll be right there.&quot; 

&quot;Okay.&quot; 

Joey hung up. 

Jeff yelled upstairs,
&quot;Catherine, I have to go the theater!&quot; 

He heard Catherine get out of bed and
soon she was standing at the top 
of the stairs. 

&quot;Why?&quot; she asked. 

Jeff hesitated and then said,
&quot;Joey's in trouble.&quot; 

&quot;Hold on,&quot; Catherine said,
&quot;I'll come with you.&quot; 

&quot;She asked me to come
alone.&quot; 

&quot;Jeff-&quot; 

&quot;Catherine, I promised.&quot; 

As Jeff left the apartment, Catherine
Anderson, the hot 
honorary-if-not-actual virgin of the Mayland
Community Theatre, muttered, 
&quot;Fuck.&quot; 

23. 
When Jeff arrived at theater, it was a few minutes past midnight. He 
parked in the alley behind the theater and as he got out of the car, he 
quickly looked around to see if Lenore was around. 

She wasn't. Nobody had seen her since
that night Jeff had bought dinner 
for her and a part of him hoped his kindness had made some difference in 
her life. 

&quot;JEFF!&quot; 

Jeff turned to see Joey London standing
in the open back doorway of the 
theater. Her curly brown hair was a tangled mess and her face was 
tracked by tears. However, she was wearing a small orange dress that 
showed off her figure. As Jeff walked over and gave her a friendly hug, 
a flash of a fantasy of him sticking his huge cock in her wet pussy 
flashed through his mind. 

Jesus, Jeff, he thought as he hugged
her and felt her body press against 
his, control yourself. 

&quot;Come inside,&quot; Joey said. 

He followed her into the theater. The
door closed behind them. 

24. 
They went to the girl's dressing room and Joey hoisted herself onto the 
counter and told Jeff what had happened. As Jeff listened to her, he 
attempted to nod sympathetically but he soon realized that every time he 
looked down, he could see, between her parted thighs, her black thong 
panties - the same type Catherine refused to wear for him. 

As Joey finished her story, she
started to cry again and said, &quot;And you 
know what's really bad?&quot; 

&quot;What?&quot; Jeff asked, wishing
he didn't have an erection. 

&quot;I was going to do the same
thing to him,&quot; she said, &quot;I'm no better than 
him.&quot; 

&quot;Yes, you are, Joey,&quot; Jeff
said, &quot;Matt never deserved you.&quot; 

&quot;No, but I deserve every Matt
Welsh out there!&quot; 

&quot;Joey-&quot; 

&quot;Face it, Jeff, I'm a
whore!&quot; 

Jeff placed his hands on her
shoulder. &quot;You are not a whore.&quot; 

&quot;Everything Catherine says about
me is true.&quot; 

&quot;What?&quot; 

&quot;I know what she says. I know
what every girl in the world says. And 
they're right.&quot; 

He wrapped his arms around her back
and held her head to his chest. 
&quot;They're not!&quot; 

&quot;Why are you so kind,
Jeff?&quot; Joey asked. 

&quot;I'm not that great-&quot; 

&quot;Yes, you are. Catherine's very
lucky,&quot; Between her tears, Joey actually 
laughed. 

&quot;Do you believe I envy her? I'm
jealous of her - who would have ever 
guessed?&quot; 

She laughed again. Jeff laughed with
her and then suddenly, he felt her 
lips kissing his neck. 

&quot;Joey-&quot; he started. 

&quot;Please, Jeff-&quot; she said,
kissing his chin. 

&quot;Joey, I can't-&quot; 

&quot;Please, I just want to know
what love feels like.&quot; 

He looked down at her and then,
almost as if in a dream, he leaned 
forward and kissed her parted lips. She rolled her tongue into his mouth 
and ran her hands down his back, finally grabbing his butt and pulling 
him close and suddenly, Jeff felt like he was about to explode. 

&quot;Oh, Jeff...&quot; she said as
he nuzzled her ear. 

&quot;Oh, Catherine-&quot; he
replied. 

She let go of his behind and pushed
him back. 

&quot;You really love her, don't
you?&quot; she asked. 

Jeff kept his hands on her shoulders,
not replying. 

&quot;I'm sorry, Jeff,&quot; Joey
said, &quot;I'm sorry I ever tried to steal-&quot; 

Suddenly, he lunged forward and
kissed her hard on the mouth, snuffing 
out any words in her mouth. She tried to squeal his name as she vainly 
hit at his shoulders, trying to push him off her. 

&quot;Jeff, no...&quot; she said. 

He shifted the full weight of his
body onto hers and she fell back onto 
the counter, her skirt hiking up enough to expose her tiny panties. As 
he continued to roughly kiss her neck, he ran his right hand over 
struggling thighs. Finally, he grabbed the waist band of her panties and 
tried to yank them down. 

She screamed, &quot;NO, JEFF,
PLEASE!&quot; 

&quot;SHUT UP!&quot; Jeff yelled. He
was going to fuck her because he wanted to 
fuck her, because she had nearly lost him Catherine, because she had 
spent months fucking tempting him and now she thought she could just 
blow him off. 

He continued to pull at her panties
as she tried to grab his hands and 
pull them away from her sex. She continued to bed as he bit into her 
neck, tasting her flesh and as she begged him for mercy, he could feel 
his cock, as huge as it ever had been, pressing against his jeans, 
almost begging to be plugged into her wet hole... 
Joey managed to get one knee up and hit Jeff in the groin. As Jeff 
yelled in pain and shock, Joey managed to roll off the counter. She fell 
to the floor, banging her forehead as she did so. Dazed, she struggled 
to stand up even as she heard Jeff, breathing like an enraged beast, 
forcing himself back up. The back of her skirt had flown up, revealing 
the black thong disappearing into the smooth contours of her ass. She 
felt Jeff slapping her ass and instinctively, she ran for the open 
doorway. 
As she went forward, Jeff tripped back to the floor. Underneath one of 
the counters, as if left there as a sick joke, was one of the knives 
used to kill Caesar. Jeff grabbed it and then jumped up. Joey was nearly 
towards the doorway and Jeff suddenly felt more adrenaline than he had 
ever felt in his entire life pumping through his body. He jumped up and 
just as Joey reached the doorway, he placed his hand over her mouth and 
roughly spun her around. Her back hit the wall with a dull thud as he 
quickly closed the dressing room door. 

Joey's eyes were wide like a
frightened doe and she stared down at the 
knife Jeff was gripping in his hand. Tears ran down her cheeks. 

&quot;Jeff, please, no...&quot; she
said. 

Her pleading made him harder. Jeff
stared at her, not a shred of remorse 
in his usually kind eyes. 

&quot;Please don't rape me,&quot; she
begged. 

Jeff continued to stare at her.
Finally, he stepped forward and placed 
the blade of the knife to her neck. 

&quot;Please, my uncle raped
me,&quot; she sobbed, &quot;Please, I can't go through it 
again...&quot; 

Jeff stared at the blade against her
neck. With one quick movement, he 
could kill her. He liked that. 

Finally, he said, &quot;I'm not going
to rape you.&quot; 

&quot;Please, Jeff - I'm sorry. If
you just let me go, I'll leave town 
and...&quot; 

&quot;Take off your dress.&quot; 

&quot;OH, GOD, PLEASE!&quot; 

Jeff leaned forward and spat in her
face. &quot;If you don't take off your 
dress in ten seconds, I will kill you. I will slit your throat and I 
will fuck your corpse.&quot; 

&quot;Jeff...&quot; 

&quot;DO IT, YOU FUCKING WHORE!&quot;


Still sobbing, she reached behind her
back and unzipped her dress. She 
shrugged it off her shoulder and then stood in front of Jeff in her 
black bra and panties. 

&quot;Please...oh God...&quot; Joey's
entire body was quivering. 

Jeff looked her over and then said,
&quot;The rest.&quot; 

&quot;GOD, NO! DON'T RAPE ME! PLEASE
- I'd rather you kill me-&quot; 

&quot;I'm not going to rape you,
Joey.&quot; A strange smile came to Jeff's lips 
and suddenly, his once handsome face was evil and twisted. &quot;I just want 
to look at you.&quot; 

&quot;please...&quot; 

&quot;I want to see you. Let me see
you and you can go. I promise.&quot; 

Slowly, Joey slipped off her bra and
then her panties. There was none of 
her usual sultriness, just defeat and fear but the defeat and fear made 
Jeff's heart race. He looked over naked body - at the small but firm 
tits and the auburn triangle of pubic hair. Joey attempted to place her 
hand over her sex but Jeff slapped it away. 
Jeff reached out and touched her. He moved his hands over her body, 
squeezing her breasts and her clit. While he shoved his right hand 
between her thighs, making her jump, he used his left to squeeze her 
nipples until she squealed in pain and closed her eyes, obviously 
praying for an escape. Jeff kept squeezing until he saw her eyelids 
start to flutter. 

Quickly, he placed his hand behind
her head and roughly shoved her down 
to the floor. She hit the floor with a thud and lay still as tears 
streamed from her eyes. 
Quickly, Jeff undressed. Naked, he knelt down and placed the knife to 
her right cheek. 

&quot;Spread your legs,&quot; he
said. 

&quot;Oh please...&quot; 

&quot;NOW!&quot; 

Joey spread her legs. Jeff's cock
twitched at the sight of her compliant 
body. 

&quot;You close them and I'll kill
you,&quot; he said. 

He clenched his fist and punched her
in her right eye. She cried it in 
pain as the eye swelled shut and her legs quivered. Jeff pressed the 
knife against her throat and said, &quot;Keep them open, bitch.&quot; 

He grabbed her hips and pulled her to
him. He rammed his cock into her 
terror-dry pussy and immediately started pumping as she continued to 
cry. As he fucked her tight pussy, Jeff dropped the knife to the ground 
and placed his hands around her throat and, as he continued to pump into 
her, he imagined squeezing her throat until her windpipe collapsed. He 
imagined watching her struggle for breath before suffocating. He was 
lying on her back, taking her from behind, fucking her the way he always 
wanted to fuck Catherine, like a beast without any worry about what was 
right or respectful. She and her tight little body were all his. 

As he rhythmically pumped into her,
he yelled, &quot;Matt ever fuck you like 
this!?&quot; 

She continued to cry. Jeff felt
himself starting to cum and he pumped 
even harder as it gushed into her pussy. Joey cried out - no words, just 
a desperate plea for it all to end. 

After Jeff came, he lay on her body
for a few minutes. 

Between sobs, Joey said, &quot;You
promised you wouldn't rape me.&quot; 

Jeff pulled his limp dick out of her
and said, &quot;I lied.&quot; 

He stood up and, leaving her on the
floor, he walked over to the mirror 
and looked at himself. Slowly, it dawned on him. He had fucked Joey 
London. He had raped her. He was a rapist. When he was doing it, it was 
like he was in a dream and now as he stared at himself, he realized it 
was real. 

He had held a knife to her throat and
raped her. 

He was an evil man. 

In the mirror, he saw Joey slowly
standing, her face red and bruised. 
She stumbled around the dressing room and finally, found her underwear. 
As she slid up her thong panties to cover her violated sex, Jeff turned 
to her. 

&quot;I'm - I'm sorry,&quot; he said.


She stared at him. &quot;You bastard!
You raped me!&quot; 

&quot;Joey-&quot; 

&quot;I begged you -&quot; Suddenly,
rage replaced her fear. &quot;You're not getting 
away with this! This isn't happening to me again!&quot; 

Jeff stared at her and realized she
was right. He had committed a crime 
and it didn't matter that he was a talented actor and writer or that he 
was usually a good man or that he loved Catherine Anderson. He was a 
rapist and he could go to jail. 

&quot;YOU BASTARD!&quot; she shouted.


Jeff looked over at the knife, lying
on the floor. Joey followed his 
gaze and when she saw the knife, she lunged for it. Suddenly filled with 
another rush of power, Jeff lunged after her, knocking her to the floor 
as he grabbed the knife. 

They both stood up at the same time
and stared at each other. Jeff, 
nude, with his knife. Joey, in only the black thong underwear Catherine 
wouldn't wear, her eyes darting wildly around the room looking for 
escape. 

Suddenly, Joey sprinted for the door.
Almost on some suppressed impulse, 
Jeff thrust the knife forward and shoved the sharpened blade into Joey's 
pierced belly. 

Joey opened her mouth and squealed in
pain, as her hands reached for 
Jeff's hands, trying to grab the knife's handle. Jeff looked down. Up to 
the hilt, the entire blade was in her belly. Joey opened her mouth and 
coughed blood that landed in specks on Jeff's face. 

Slowly, she stepped back as the
bloody blade slipped out of her stomach. 
A river of bright red blood flowed down her legs, forming pools on the 
dressing room floor. Slowly, Joey placed her hands over the gaping wound 
and looked at Jeff, her eyes no longer scared or angry but confused. 

&quot;Why?&quot; she gasped. 

She fell onto her back and struggled
for breath as blood continued to 
bubble from her stomach. Jeff sat on her chest, his dick momentarily 
dipping into her blood. 

She stared up at him. 

&quot;please...&quot; 

Jeff brought the knife blade down to
her throat. 

She started to gasp, &quot;N---&quot;


With one quick slice across her neck,
he silenced her. He watched as 
blood started to run out of the narrow wound. She placed her hands on 
her neck and her eyes rolled up into her head. 

He heard her gasp one last thing.
&quot;I love you, Johnny.&quot; 

Jeff stared down at her. &quot;Who
the fuck is Johnny?&quot; 

Her eyes slowly closed and her arms
fell limply away from her throat. An 
odor spread through the room as Joey's bladder released its contents and 
she drew one last breath. Blood continued to trickle out of her mouth. 

Jeff stood and stared down at her
sprawled body. 

She was dead. 

He wasn't just a rapist. He was a
murderer. 

&quot;Oh crap,&quot; he muttered. 

25. 
His mind worked quickly, never questioning why he was murderer, just 
accepting that something had to be done. Quickly, he went into the 
bathroom and washed off Joey's blood. He got dressed. He knew the 
theater still had a shovel from last season's production of Hamlet and 
he ran to the scene shop and grabbed it. 

As he turned to leave, he saw a
Polaroid camera sitting on a counter. It 
was the camera used to take back stage cast pictures. 

Jeff stared at it. 

He was going to bury Joey. He knew he
should convince himself she had 
left town, that this was all just a dream. But deep down, in a part of 
his soul that scared him to death, he knew he didn't want to forget. He 
grabbed the camera and seeing it still had film, he ran back to the 
dressing room. 

Joey was still lying on the floor,
nude but for black thong panties 
soaked with urine and blood. Blood was still running from her stomach, 
her throat, and her open mouth. Her eyes, puffy and bruised, were still 
closed. Thank God for that ... he knew there'd be no way he could bury 
her if she was looking up at him. 
Jeff stood over Joey's bloody corpse and took a quick picture. The 
picture shot out of the Polaroid, hitting the bloody floor. Jeff picked 
it up and though he knew he needed to be getting rid of the body, he 
watched the picture develop. He watched her corpse slowly come into 
focus and it filled him with a sick thrill. 

Once he had the picture, he took
another from a different angle. After 
that one developed, he quickly grabbed the camera, pictures, knife, and 
shovel, and ran out to the back alley. He put them in the back of his 
car and looked around for witnesses. Seeing none, he reentered the 
building. 

He picked up Joey's limp body and
could almost feel the heat in her body 
being replaced with cold death. Holding onto her shoulders, he pulled 
her out to the alley, leaving behind a trail of her blood as he did so. 
He'd have to return and clean. 

Shit, what had he done? 

What would Catherine think of this- 

He forced any thoughts of Catherine
from his mind. He loved Catherine. 
He wasn't an evil man - he loved Catherine Anderson. 

As pulled Joey's body into the alley,
he heard a tiny gasp and footsteps 
running away. Jeff dropped the body and turned to see a petite figure 
with long black hair, wearing a transparent black dress, running for the 
street. 

Lenore. 

SHIT! 

Before he knew it, Jeff was running
after her. He caught up to her just 
as she stepped out onto the deserted street. He grabbed her by her hair 
and pulled her back to him. He spun her around. 

She stared up at him.
&quot;Please,&quot; she said, &quot;I'll do anything.&quot; 

Jeff could barely hear his own hard
voice say, &quot;Suck my dick.&quot; 

Quickly, Lenore knelt down. Jeff
unzipped his fly and pulled out his 
limp penis. 

&quot;Make it hard and you might
live,&quot; Jeff said. 

Lenore took the head in her mouth and
slowly sucked the shaft into her 
mouth like some sort of vacuum. She curled her tongue around his 
hardening cock, running the tip over his balls while her saliva massaged 
his erection. 

Jeff closed his eyes and suddenly, he
could see the scene in his head as 
if it was in some sick film that Matt would have liked. A dank alley. 
Lenore sucking his dick while Joey's violated corpse lay close behind 
them... 

In the distance, he heard a police
siren. Suddenly, Lenore pulled away. 
Jeff opened his eyes and quickly put his erection back in his jeans. He 
could still hear the sirens but didn't know where they were... 

&quot;SHIT!&quot; he spat. 

He looked down at Lenore. She was
still on her knees, her eyes now 
looking like the eyes of a scared 16 year-old. 

&quot;Please...&quot; she started. 

Jeff was so sick of hearing that
word. He grabbed the back of her dog 
collar and, in one solid motion, smashed her head into the theater's 
brick wall, knocking her out. 

He let go of her and her petite form
collapsed onto its back. She was 
lightly breathing but had a huge, bloody gash across her forehead. 

Still hearing the siren, Jeff grabbed
Lenore's form and dragged her over 
to the car. He put her in the passenger's seat. Quickly, he popped open 
the trunk, grabbed Joey's body, and shoved her in. He closed the trunk 
and ran over to the driver's seat. 

The sirens were in the distance now. 

They weren't after him. 

Yet. 

26. 
Mayland was a country town. Even though Texas was
being rapidly 
industrialized, there was still a great deal of open space out there 
that few people ever bothered to see. Jeff had never been more thankful 
for that fact than that night. 

He drove out of Mayland,
getting on the highway and eventually exiting 
onto an access road next to miles of empty plain. Jeff pulled over to 
the side. He got out and looked around. No one was around. 

First things first. He opened the
passenger's side door and pulled 
Lenore out. She muttered incoherently in her unconscious state as he 
laid her out in the field. He then ran back to the car and got the knife 
and camera. 

He returned to Lenore's body and
looked down at her. She was twitching, 
probably struggling to wake up. Her body was underdeveloped but she was 
just a kid really. Eventually, Jeff guessed she would have been as hot 
as Joey London. 

&quot;Well,&quot; he said, &quot;at
least she can be as dead.&quot; 

He laughed and then stopped. 

Why was he joking? Jesus Christ, what
was he doing? 

Jeff knelt down and raised the knife
above Lenore's chest. He wanted to 
sacrifice her like in some cheesy horror movie but he couldn't bring the 
knife down. He wanted to see her. 

Her black dress was fastened in front
with rusty spider-shaped buttons. 
His hands trembling with anticipation, Jeff quickly unbuttoned the dress 
and slipped it off. She was lying before him in just a black slip that 
she probably considered to be very gothic. She had a slim body. Flat 
chested but some girls developed later than others.
But Lenore wasn't 
unattractive. 

Using the knife blade, Jeff quickly
cut the straps of the slip. He held 
her up and let the slip fall off her body. He then lay her back down and 
stared down at her. She wasn't wearing a bra and her tits were tiny with 
nipples that stood up like bullets. She was wearing blue cotton panties 
and Jeff suddenly smiled. Catherine owned a pair just like those. 

He grabbed the camera and took a
picture of her, nude except for her 
panties and a dog collar. Sounded like a New York art show in the 
'80s... 

He laughed again and stopped. He was
a murderer and a rapist and perhaps 
a child molester. He shouldn't laugh. 

Suddenly, Lenore's eyes flew open.
She realized she was undressed and, 
wildly looking up at Jeff, she gasped, &quot;Please, don't rape me!&quot; 

Jeff smiled. Just like Joey. 

&quot;Oh please...&quot; she begged,
her undeveloped chest heaving. 

Jeff's smile disappeared. He didn't
have the strength to rape her. 

&quot;I'm not going to rape
you,&quot; he said, raising the knife. 

She opened her mouth wide and
screamed as he brought the blade down into 
her blue panties and the cold, bloody metal tore into her teen age 
pussy. Howling like an animal, Lenore clasped her hands over her bloody 
panties and tried to roll to the side. Jeff grabbed her and rolled her 
onto her back. 

&quot;OHNONONONONO! PLEASE NO!&quot;
she screamed as he brought the knife down 
again and the blade went through her hands and caused more damage to her 
cunt. 

&quot;SHUT UP!&quot; Jeff screamed at
her, suddenly enraged by her begging and 
fighting. 

She thrashed her head wildly.
&quot;IT HURTS! OH GOD, IT HURTS!&quot; 

He reached down and yanked her hand
away from her bleeding cunt. He 
brought the knife down again, hoping it was slicing straight through her 
clit. When it entered her and her screams again pierced the night like a 
coyote, Jeff didn't pull the knife out. Instead, he slashed upward, 
gutting her from her crotch to her sternum. Blood sprayed from her 
wounds, drenching his face as her howls of pain became gurgling moans. 
Jeff yanked the knife out of her and watched as Lenore's eyes glazed 
over. Her body slowly stopped moving. 

She was dead. 

He was hard. 

Quickly, he pulled down her panties
and stared down at the shredded 
remains of her pussy. He pulled out his heavy cock and plunged into the 
bloody hole that was once her crotch. Her warm blood seemed to greedily 
pull his penis into her wound and, within a few minutes, he came inside 
her corpse. 

Jeff pulled out and quickly put his
blood covered dick back in his 
jeans. He grabbed the camera and took another picture of Lenore, gutted 
like dead game, her crotch in bloody tatters. 

He went back to the car and got the
shovel. It took him two hours to dig 
a grave he felt was deep enough and far away enough from the highway. 
His body covered in dried blood and sweat, Jeff wiped his forehead and 
then went over to Lenore's body. 
Her petite corpse was light and easy to drag. Quickly, he rolled her 
body into the grave and turned to get her clothes. 

And Jeff Stern, rapist, murdered, necrophile, threw up. 

It was lying near the grave - a
circling, thick cord of intestine. It 
must have fallen out of Lenore's body as he dragged her. Quickly, he 
kicked it into the grave. He then gathered both girls' clothes and 
dumped them in, effectively covering Lenore's body. 
He went and opened the trunk. Joey's bloody body, now the bluish color 
of death, waited for him and again, Jeff realized he was a murderer. 

&quot;Please, God,&quot; he said,
closing his eyes, &quot;Let this be a dream.&quot; 

He opened his eyes. He wasn't in bed
with Catherine. He was out in the 
middle of nowhere, staring down at a corpse. 

Quickly, he pulled Joey's body out of
the trunk. It was stiff now and he 
had to stop to catch his breath twice on the way to the grave. When he 
did reach the grave, he shoved Joey in. She landed on her stomach and 
Jeff took one last look at that perfect ass wearing that forbidden 
thong. 

He got the camera and took another
picture. 

He then filled in the grave. 

27. 
When Jeff finally got back to the theater, it was nearly five in the 
morning. 

Catherine would be worried. 

SHIT! 

What if she had come down to the
theater? What if she had seen the 
blood? Fuck, what if she was waiting in there - what would he do? Kill 
her? Kill the woman he loved? 

&quot;You're not an evil man,&quot;
he assured himself, &quot;This will never happen 
again.&quot; 

He got out of the car and nervously
walked up to the alley door. He 
stuck his head into the theater and shouted, &quot;Catherine!?&quot; 

Silence. 
Please, he prayed, please, God, don't let her be here. 

He entered the building and searched
around - no sign of Catherine. As 
far as he could tell, nobody had come by. Quickly, Jeff went to the 
janitor's closet and got a mop and a pail of water. For a half hour, he 
mopped up the pools of blood that Joey had left behind. He washed up in 
the bathroom and then stole a pair of jeans and a tee-shirt from the 
costume room. He put them on and threw his bloody clothes into the 
dumpster outside. 

Then, he left. 

28. 
When he arrived home, Catherine was sitting in the living room. 

&quot;I was worried,&quot; she said,
&quot;Where have you been?&quot; 

&quot;Talking to Joey,&quot; Jeff
said. 

&quot;For six hours!?&quot; 

Jeff told her about Matt and Rachel
and that Joey told him about the 
time her uncle had raped her. Finally, he explained, he could tell she 
was suicidal so he took her down to the IHOP across the street from the 
Royal Motel and got her some food. 

Catherine stared at him. &quot;And
then what happened?&quot; 

Jeff sighed. &quot;She got in her car
and she left.&quot; 

&quot;What do you mean left?&quot; 

&quot;She left town. She said there
was nothing left for her in Mayland.&quot; 

&quot;Jeff, are you telling me the truth?&quot;


&quot;Catherine, I will never lie to
you. You know that.&quot; 

&quot;Please, Jeff - just be honest.
Did you - did you fuck her?&quot; 

The question caught Jeff off guard.
&quot;No, of course not. I love you, 
Catherine.&quot; 

Suddenly, Catherine started to cry.
&quot;She's so much prettier than me, 
Jeff!&quot; 

&quot;You're beautiful.&quot; 

&quot;No, I'm not-&quot; 

He hugged her and held her close as
she cried. 

&quot;I love you, Catherine,&quot; he
said. 

29. 
It shocked Jeff how easily things worked out. Lenore, of course, no one 
missed. But Joey - she still had one more performance of Julius Caesar 
left. That afternoon, after a brief nap, Jeff called Veronica Sanders and told 
her Joey had left town. 

On the other end, Veronica cursed and
said, &quot;That fucking whore.&quot; 

Luckily, since Joey's role was nonspeaking, her absence wasn't a major 
crisis. 

Jeff then went to Matt's apartment
and told him Joey had left. 

&quot;Fuck!&quot; Matt replied,
&quot;What am I going to do with all that bitch's 
shit!?&quot; 

In the end, Matt ended up donating
all of Joey's clothes and other 
possessions to the Goodwill. 

Two weeks after the final performance
of Julius Caesar, Matt and Jeff 
got a cup of coffee and Matt said, &quot;Well, it had to happen. I'm leaving 
Mayland.&quot; 

&quot;What?&quot; Jeff said. 

&quot;I'm going to go down to
Dallas,&quot; Matt said, &quot;Stay with some friends of 
mine.&quot; 

&quot;What about your
apartment?&quot; 

Matt smirked. &quot;I'll break my
fucking lease. I gotta get out of this 
town.&quot; 

&quot;Why?&quot; 

&quot;Its obvious,&quot; Matt said,
&quot;Mayland women are fucking nuts.&quot; 

30. 
As for Jeff, he kept the pictures of Joey and Lenore hidden in a 
notebook. Some nights, if Catherine wasn't in the mood, he'd masturbate 
to them and in his mind, replay every scream of terror and every useless 
plea. 

And some nights, he'd look over at
Catherine sleeping next to him and 
realize all he had to do to kill her was place his pillow over her face 
and smother the life out of her. 

But he knew he wouldn't. 

Or at least he hoped he wouldn't. 

Sometimes, if the urge got too much,
he'd slip out of bed and go into 
the bathroom. 

He'd stare at his innocent face in
the mirror and Jeff Stern would ask, 
&quot;Are you an evil man?&quot;
