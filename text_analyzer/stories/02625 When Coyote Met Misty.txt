Synopsis: Coyote captures some Crinolinas, swiftest and prettiest of land fays.  Who in the end will get the upper hand?WHEN COYOTE MET MISTY   
By C  
Part I  
For the Mythican hunter in a hurry, there are few manuals more clearly written&ndash;and
  more informative&ndash;than Crinolina: A Brief Guide for Busy Predators  .
  Every paragraph is a little feast in itself. Let me share with you a few of my  favorite
  passages:  
&quot;No land fay in Mythica is more winsome, or more flavorful,
      than Fatamorgana Crinolina--Crinolina for short. Unlike other fays, she
      always wears a sleeveless dress with full skirt and petticoat. The petticoat
      is a veritable baffle of brilliant white crinolines&ndash;sometimes a hundred
      or more. A pair of magic high heels, always matching at least one color
      on the dress, completes her ensemble and enables her to run at speeds daunting
      to most predators . . . .&quot;    
&quot;She has other defenses besides her speed: for example, her
      crinolines are not just a lure for prospective mates; they mask her scent
      quite effectively, so that she is easily the most difficult fay to track.
      And mature crinolinas command a number of glamors and enchantments . .
      . .&quot;   
&quot;She is not, however, uncatchable. For instance, she is as
      vulnerable as any other fay to those predators that sit and wait . . .
      . &quot;   
   
The covey of crinolinas had spread out through the valley in their search
  for wildflowers, so that none was closer to another than thirty feet. Such
  an arrangement lessened the chance of quarrels over food. Misty, a blonde,
  beautifully mature crinolina in a white dress with red polka-dots, was standing
  about dead-center in the valley. She had found an especially scrumptious cluster
  of bluebells and was glancing over toward her friend Jenna to see what the
  other girl might have discovered. Just then, a clump of grasses in front of
  Jenna flew apart and out jumped a giant trapdoor spider. Jenna screamed as
  she fell back in the high grass, the monster on top of her. Her lemon-yellow
  skirt flew up. Her yellow heels kicked, again and again. At this point, Misty
  and the others began to run. &quot;Don't panic!&quot; she heard up and down
  the line of fays. &quot;Don't panic!&quot; Then another girl screamed, and
  yet another, both of them claimed by spiders. &quot;They're everywhere!&quot; someone
  shouted. The girls now galloped off in every conceivable direction. About ten
  feet ahead of Misty, a green-clad girl was taken from behind. Thick black legs
  enveloped her, drew back her petticoat, and pulled her, thrashing and shrieking,
  into the monster's lair. Within seconds only her legs could be seen, the panties
  already at her ankles. Then she was gone. Misty heard more screams and held
  her ears to shut them out. &quot;Just . . . let me . . . get away&quot; she
  said to herself as she dashed along, her red pumps flashing.  
&quot;If the covey in which crinolinas customarily travel is scattered,
      its members become a good deal more vulnerable . . . .&quot;   
   
Where were the others? Misty couldn't tell. Unable to think of anything else
  to do, she kept on running. Soon she came to a wood. Zooming along would be
  dangerous in this tangle of trees, so she slowed to a walk and moved cautiously
  in. After what seemed like an hour, she found a clearing. Stepping out into
  the open, she saw that she was not the first arrival. Standing in front of
  a big rock in the middle of the clearing were three other crinolinas. As she
  got closer, Misty saw they were a trio of young adults from her covey: Barbi,
  a blonde dressed in sky-blue; Buffy, a brunette in pink; and Bonnie, a redhead
  in key-lime green. Misty groaned inwardly: she had never thought much of these
  three; but familiar faces were familiar faces, so she joined them.  
&quot;Misty!&quot; said Barbi. &quot;How are you?&quot;  
&quot;A little tired,&quot; said the older fay. &quot;We should probably
  rest, and then go looking for the others. I think . . . .&quot;  
Before she could finish, Buffy interrupted: &quot;Bad luck about those spiders,
  hunh?&quot;  
&quot;I'll say!&quot; said Bonnie. &quot;One minute, we're talking about
  who to take to the big fay dance; the next, we're running for our lives!&quot;  
&quot;The boys wouldn't want to see us all mussed up like this!&quot; said
  Barbi as she straightened out a wrinkle in her skirt.  
&quot;Well,&quot; said Misty. &quot;If you don't want to get really 'mussed
  up,' I suggest we give some thought to getting back to the . . . .&quot;  
&quot;Say,&quot; said Barbi to Buffy, &quot;Do you think Merovech would like
  it if I squirted some clover honey behind each ear?&quot;  
&quot;Honey, Merovech isn't interested in your ears!&quot; Buffy said with
  a laugh.  
&quot;Is anyone listening to me?&quot; said Misty.  
&quot;We're listening,&quot; said Barbi. &quot;By the way, Buff, do you still
  have that nail polish?&quot;  
And so it went. Misty sighed and checked their surroundings for suspicious
  clumps of grass. It was just then that Bonnie let out a shriek. &quot;Mouse!&quot; she
  cried. &quot;Oh dear God! Oh dear God!&quot;  
&quot;Some of nature's humblest creatures undergo a strange alchemy
      when fays are near. The most remarkable example of this phenomenon is the
      lowly field mouse, who becomes a fierce and lethal hunter whenever a crinolina
      is unlucky enough to cross his path. Undaunted by her crinolines, he darts
      straight up her leg and then bites her where she is most tender. Unless
      she can quickly pull him free, his little nips will soon overcome her.
      Her crinolines are now a hindrance to her as she struggles to grasp him
      and toss him away . . . .&quot;   
   
Misty looked over and saw the mouse, just a few feet from Bonnie. She and
  the others turned to run, only to realize that the big rock was surrounded
  by a gang of the evil little creatures! They were resting on their hind legs,
  blinking their beady little eyes, and licking their lips. Gasping and crying
  now, the four fays jumped up onto the rock and tucked their skirts between
  their legs. &quot;Don't move,&quot; said Misty. For once, the others paid attention.  
Minutes passed, and nothing happened. Misty looked down at the nearest mouse,
  and for the first time her keen crinolina eyesight perceived something very
  strange: on the creature's belly a word was stenciled: ACME. &quot;What the
  fuck is this?&quot; she said.  
&quot;A diversion, if cleverly engineered, can be very effective
      . . . . &quot;      
Misty examined the other mice and saw that all were marked in exactly the
  same way. What's more, aside from blinking and licking, the little monsters
  were not moving at all. With further scrutiny, it soon became clear that their
  blinks and licks had a distinctly mechanical rhythm. &quot;They're not real!&quot; said
  Misty. &quot;Hey guys, they're not . . . .&quot; Just then she realized she
  was alone on the rock. Where had the others gone? She heard a moan, coming
  from beyond the far edge, so she walked over to take a look. There, on the
  ground below her, lay Barbi, Buffy, and Bonnie. Their dresses looked . . .
  disheveled, as if something had been pawing at them. Each girl had a bite mark
  high on her left breast. Clearly, some critter much bigger than a mouse was
  responsible. The girls appeared to be semi-conscious: they moaned, and kicked
  spasmodically, but otherwise produced no sound or movement. Misty was about
  to jump down to take a closer look, when she heard a noise behind her. She
  turned. It was Coyote. His right paw was extended, and in it was a little heap
  of gray powder. &quot;Acme's patented Sleepy Dust,&quot; he said. &quot;Just
  the thing for quiet captures!&quot; Then he blew the powder into her face.  
Part II  
   
&quot;A careful predator will take pains to secure his prey . .
      . .&quot;   
When Misty came to, she had no idea how long she'd been out. She was lying
  on her back next to her three younger companions. Her left breast was stinging.
  When she tried to move, she realized that her wrists were bound beneath her. &quot;He
  doesn't take any chances,&quot; she said to herself. Groaning, the three younger
  girls awoke shortly after she did.  
&quot;W-what happened?&quot; Barbi asked.  
&quot;We were caught,&quot; said Misty. &quot;By Coyote.&quot; (At this news,
  the others gasped in horror.) &quot;The mice&ndash;that was just a trick .
  . . to get our guard down. Needless to say . . . it worked.&quot;  
&quot;W-what's going to happen to us?&quot; asked Buffy.  
&quot;What do you think is going to happen?&quot; snapped Misty. &quot;Honestly,
  if you three aren't the dumbest crinolinas I've ever met . . . .&quot;  
&quot;You don't have to be nasty about it!&quot; said Bonnie. &quot;Why don't
  we put our heads together and think . . . think of a way out?&quot;  
&quot;Right!&quot; said Barbi and Buffy together.  
&quot;Good lord,&quot; said Misty. &quot;You really are as clueless as you
  sound. For you three, there is   no way out. I   might
  have a chance, but if I do, it's a ticket good for only one.&quot;  
&quot;What do you mean?&quot; said Bonnie.  
&quot;It won't do you any good, so you don't need to know about it.&quot;  
&quot;You are such   a bitch!&quot; shouted Barbi. &quot;Screw
  her&ndash;let's use our heads, girls. We've always been able to lead Merovech,
  Chlodovech, and Guthlac by their noses. How much harder can one old Coyote
  be?&quot;  
&quot;Right!&quot; said the other two.  
&quot;Heaven help us,&quot; said Misty.  
Just then, Coyote reappeared. &quot;I couldn't stay away!&quot; he said as
  he shrugged off a knapsack and placed it on the ground.  
&quot;Uh . . . uh . . . hi,&quot; said Barbi. &quot;Gee, you sure . . . got
  the drop on us.&quot;  
&quot;I did at that,&quot; said Coyote with a smirk.  
&quot;You know,&quot; she said, &quot;You're very handsome . . . for a coyote.&quot;  
&quot;Why, thank you.&quot;  
&quot;M-maybe we could . . . come to an arrangement . . . .&quot;  
&quot;Arrangement? What do you mean?&quot;  
&quot;Well, don't you . . . don't you think we're pretty?&quot;  
&quot;I surely do.&quot;  
&quot;Well, couldn't we maybe . . . have a . . . a relationship?&quot;  
&quot;Oh,&quot; said Coyote. &quot;I think I see where this is going. If
  I understand you correctly, that's a nice suggestion&ndash;but there are problems.&quot;  
&quot;P-problems?&quot; said Barbi.  
&quot;Yup,&quot; said Coyote. &quot;A long-term relationship with fays tends
  to be short-term&ndash;very short-term&ndash;for the non-fay. So . . . I'm
  going to say thanks, but I'll stick with our initial arrangement.&quot;  
&quot;Initial a-arrangement?&quot; said Barbi.  
&quot;You know,&quot; he said. &quot;The one where I pull your petticoats
  back, take your panties down, and kill you.&quot;  
&quot;Predators have different opinions regarding crinolines. Some
      find them a bother and a distraction. Others love a leisurely game of slipping
      them back, one after another, until at last the pretty package they conceal
      is unwrapped. It's a great way, too, for a predator to get better acquainted
      with his prey . . . .&quot;   
The three girls screamed, and wailed, and pleaded for their lives, of course,
  but it made no difference; on this subject, Coyote was adamant. He started
  with Barbi. First, he drew her big blue skirt past her waist, as far as it
  would go (its hem reached her chin). Then, slowly, patiently, he pulled her
  crinolines in the same direction, one by one. As he did so, he hummed a little
  tune. Crying all the while, Barbi twisted and kicked, but, weakened by the
  heady mix of Sleepy Powder and Coyote venom, she accomplished nothing. More
  than once, her crinolines fell back into place, and Coyote started all over
  again. Once, he got his snout tangled in them and started to sneeze. Barbi,
  Buffy, and Bonnie all shrieked in response.  
&quot;It's not the sneezing that's going to kill you,&quot; Misty said under
  her breath.  
   
After about fifteen minutes, Barbi cried out: &quot;Enough! Enough already!
  Just get it over with!&quot;  
&quot;Very well,&quot; said Coyote and yanked back her crinolines all at
  once. Now all that protected her from her captor was a pair of white panties,
  dotted with little bluebells. Barbi and her friends sobbed even louder now;
  Misty turned her head away.  
&quot;Never mind!&quot; cried Barbi through her tears. &quot;I can wait!
  Really . . . really.&quot;  
&quot;Ahhh,&quot; said Coyote. &quot;So can I.&quot; He returned the crinolines
  to their proper place and started over.  
&quot;Then down come her panties. Expect the tears and begging
      to intensify. Remember that you must be firm . . . .  &quot;  
How long it took was impossible to say, but at last he pulled back the final
  crinoline and gently flattened it out on top of the others.  
Barbi was beside herself: &quot;Please don't take my panties down,&quot; she
  whimpered. &quot; . . . oh please, please, please, please, please!&quot;  
&quot;But I want to have my fay and eat her, too,&quot; said Coyote. So he
  gripped the girl's underpants in front and drew them down her violently trembling
  legs. Soon they lay in a little heap next to her feet. Then, gently but firmly,
  he pulled her legs apart. Beneath its V of damp blond hair, her snatch was
  pink and very tight. When Coyote saw it, his big Mythican tongue grew long
  and stiff. It had a sharp tip and was rough to the touch, like a cat's tongue.
  Confronted with this appendage, Barbi screamed with even more gusto than before. &quot;No!&quot; she
  wailed. &quot;It won't fit! It won't fit!&quot;  
&quot;It alwayth hath before,&quot; said Coyote as he slipped it in.  
   
Once again, Misty turned her head away. But there was no escaping Barbi's
  pain-filled squeals, or the anticipatory shrieks of her two friends. &quot;Oh,
  what the hell,&quot; she said. It might well happen to her&ndash;she preferred
  to know exactly what she was in for. She turned back, just in time to see Coyote
  draw his tongue&ndash;now slick with blood&ndash;from Barbi's pussy. He then
  started nipping. &quot;Ouch! Ouch! Ouch!&quot; cried the luckless girl as her
  snatch was assailed. Then he worked the tongue back in; Barbi gave a surprisingly
  deep groan when this happened.  
It went on like this for the next several minutes. Mostly Barbi cried; but
  in one interval between tongue and teeth, she spoke. &quot;It . . . it was
  g-going to be all right. M-Merovech was g-going to meet me at the dance. I
  was . . . I was going to let him have his way tonight. H-he'd think he'd g-gotten
  me, but . . . I'd have him! Do you understand? I'd have him! H-he'd have to
  stay with me till my . . . my belly swelled, till my eggs were ready. Then
  he'd . . . have to give himself to . . . to a predator. That's our law! He'd
  have been all mine! All mine! We'd go out . . . every night and . . . seduce
  some stupid humans into killing themselves. They'd die . . . not me! Not me!
  It isn't fair!&quot;  
&quot;Sucks to be you,&quot; said Coyote, then nipped her once more. &quot;Ouch!
  Ouch!&quot; she replied.  
At last, her final tremors began: she thrashed, bucked, kicked, and moaned
  with the strange, hurtful pleasure that Coyote brought to all his victims.
  And then she was through. &quot;One down, three to go,&quot; he said.  
Buffy was next. Coyote had evidently tired of the crinoline game: he thrust
  her petty back with little ceremony. &quot;Not so soon! Not so soon!&quot; she
  shrieked as her panties&ndash;white with red hearts&ndash;were bared. Down
  they came, exposing a little brunette muff; and soon, like Barbi before her,
  Buffy was groaning and crying &quot;Ouch! Ouch! Ouch!&quot; It wasn't long
  before another pretty pussy had given up the ghost.  
   
Then came Bonnie's turn. Her panties were pink. Her muff was bright red.
  She groaned and died just like her friends. Part III  
   
&quot;Beware a mature crinolina; her enchantments are   very powerful.
      Never turn your back on her . . . .&quot;    
For some time, Coyote just gazed at the three dead girls in a kind of reverie.
  Then he looked at Misty and said: &quot;Ahhh, an older woman! My favorite kind!&quot; With
  these words, he turned his back on her and began rummaging through his knapsack. &quot;Now
  where did I put my coyotagra?&quot;  
Misty saw her chance and modulated her voice for a tone of maximum scorn: &quot;Ugghh!&quot; she
  said, &quot;you're so arrogant; you're so . . . male  !
  You strip three foolish children of their panties, and you want to strut! I'm
  not such an easy conquest.&quot;  
&quot;Why's that?&quot; said Coyote, turning towards her again. He had a
  pill bottle in one paw.  
&quot;Look into my eyes and I'll tell you.&quot;  
He did so. Her eyes were blue, and somehow cold, reminding him of the sky
  in winter. There was a . . . deepness to them. The pill bottle fell to the
  ground, but Coyote didn't notice . . . .  
It was a quick, fevered courtship. &quot;Hey honey, let's get hitched,&quot; Coyote
  said. Misty brushed away a few tears and kissed him on his fuzzy cheek. Then
  they jumped into his convertible and took Route 666 all the way to Las Vegas
  Mythicas. At the Chapel of Bliss, the minister (ordained in sixteen different
  denominations) took their vows and pronounced them coyote and wife. It was
  a small wedding: just Coyote, Misty, the minister, and the bridesmaids: Barbi,
  Buffy, and Bonnie. As they left the chapel, Misty threw her bouquet and Barbi
  caught it. Coyote thought it odd that Barbi had blood on her dress, but he
  wasn't going to let it spoil his happy day.  
Next stop was the Inn of Desert Delights. After he had tipped the bellhop
  and sent him on his way, Coyote took his bride in his arms. She squealed with
  pleasure, and her crinolines rustled. &quot;Now there's a promise of delights,&quot; Coyote
  said. Just then, the couple heard laughter outside the window. Coyote went
  out to the balcony. Below him stood Barbi, Buffy, and Bonnie. &quot;We want
  to serenade you!&quot; Barbi said, and without further ado the girls launched
  into a light pop medley. Coyote couldn't help noticing now that all their dresses
  were streaked with blood. He and his bride stood arm in arm till the singing
  stopped.  
Barbi then tossed the bouquet up to Misty. &quot;Keep it,&quot; she said. &quot;I
  won't need it; a predator got me! Buffy and Bonnie, too!&quot;  
&quot;Oh you poor things!&quot; said Misty.  
&quot;You're right about that!&quot; said Barbi with a laugh. &quot;You're
  a lucky girl, Misty: you've got the love of a good coyote. We on the other
  hand . . . .&quot; Just then, all three lifted up their skirts and crinolines.
  Their groins were bare and bleeding.  
&quot;Ouch!&quot; said Misty. &quot;Well, thanks for the serenade.&quot; She
  ushered Coyote back into the room.  
&quot;Did I tell you I love you?&quot; said Misty to her husband.  
&quot;Yes. Tell me again.&quot;  
&quot;I love you. I'd slip into something more comfortable, but this is the
  only thing crinolinas wear.&quot; She rustled her skirt once more as she said
  this, and Coyote thought he might swoon.  
&quot;It's just fine,&quot; he said. &quot;It's more than fine.&quot;  
&quot;Well then, lover, let's go to bed.&quot;  
&quot;Sure thing. Now . . . where did I put my coyotagra?&quot;  
&quot;You silly beast; you already took it! Come to bed!&quot;  
&quot;I . . . did, didn't I? My mind just isn't working lately.&quot; She
  had already lain down on the big king-size mattress. Coyote slipped in next
  to her and took her in his arms once again.  
&quot;But won't this, uh, kill you?&quot; he asked.  
&quot;No, silly; I took coyotagra, too. It really is a wonder drug! Say,
  would you . . . pull my crinolines back one by one? I love it when you do that.&quot;  
&quot;Of course,&quot; he said. It took a while, but at last he had them
  all back. Misty's panties were a dazzling, spotless white. She wiggled her
  hips invitingly, and a little whimper caught in her throat. &quot;Oh, do it,
  lover, do it,&quot; she whispered. Coyote reached for the panties.  
&quot;Are you sure  I took my coyotagra?&quot; he asked.  
&quot;Yes!&quot; she cried. &quot;Your mind really is going. On my word of
  honor: you took it, and you can take me! Please, honey, while I'm young . .
  . do it!&quot;  
&quot;Okay,&quot; he said. &quot;Okay. I'll . . . ow!&quot;  
&quot;What now?&quot; Her exasperation was palpable.  
&quot;My arm's falling asleep.&quot; Earlier, while searching through his
  knapsack for his medicine, Coyote had unobtrusively tied a string tightly around
  his left forearm. It cut off the circulation, and now the arm was throbbing
  and stinging, as if jabbed by thousands of little needles. Without the victim's
  full involvement, Misty's enchantment dissolved like snow in the midday sun.
  Coyote came to and saw that he had never left the clearing. Barbi, Buffy, and
  Bonnie lay there, unquestionably dead. Misty was just as she had been before--except
  that her skirt and petty were now thrust back. &quot;It was . . . quite an
  illusion,&quot; said Coyote, as he picked up his pill bottle.  
&quot;Oops,&quot; said Misty.  
&quot;The most dangerous way to dispatch a crinolina is by sexual
      intercourse. Her fay magic will surely prove fatal unless her captor has
      fortified himself with effective protection. The only 100 % guarantee of
      safety comes from Acme's new drug, coyotagra. Be absolutely sure that you
      have taken a full dose of coyotagra no more than twenty minutes before
      intercourse. And keep track of the expiration date!&quot;   
&quot;A crinolina's nether regions are more delicate than those
      of any other fairy. Intercourse with a non-fay will kill her if the non-fay
      lives long enough to bring her to orgasm . . . .&quot;    
&quot;Can't we discuss this?&quot; said Misty. &quot;I mean . . . we had
  a great time in Las Vegas Mythicas, didn't we?&quot;  
&quot;Yes we did,&quot; said Coyote.  
&quot;We could work something out . . . I mean: if you just bring me off
  without getting inside of me, we'll both be safe. And mixed marriages are getting
  more common all the time. It could work . . . really it could.&quot;  
&quot;But I can't trust you,&quot; said Coyote.  
&quot;Well, you do have a point there, but you're so darned smart! I can't
  see how I'd ever get the better of you.&quot;  
&quot;Given enough time, I think you would,&quot; said Coyote. &quot;You
  almost pulled it off today. I'm sorry, sweetie, but it's over.&quot; He then
  shook two tablets into his paw and swallowed them.  
&quot;O-over?&quot; she said. &quot;Oh lord, it r-really is over, isn't it?&quot; Coyote
  nodded. &quot;Oh my. Oh my, oh my.&quot; The tears began to pour down her face. &quot;You've
  v-vanquished me . . . just like the others. I played the best trick I knew
  . . . and you w-won anyway. You're . . . Coyote the Conqueror!&quot; And with
  that, she began to sob. Gently, ever so gently, Coyote slipped her panties
  down.  
Misty was almost as tight as her younger companions. When Coyote first entered
  her, she filled the clearing with her screams. The hurt didn't go away, but
  in a short time it was matched and then surpassed by spasm after spasm of pussy-rending
  pleasure. No male fay had ever given her delight like this. She groaned deeply
  and loudly and kicked out hard with every tremor. After more orgasms than she
  could count, something at last gave way inside her. She uttered a final groan,
  kicked a few more times, and then was still. &quot;Wow,&quot; said Coyote.  
Part IV  
When Coyote met the spiders that evening, they greeted him with unfeigned
  warmth. &quot;It worked just the way you said it would!&quot; said the Spider
  Queen. &quot;We caught a dozen of them!&quot;  
&quot;Location, location, location,&quot; said Coyote. &quot;And you sent
  four very nice ones right to me. Any doubts now about the value of a cooperative
  venture?&quot;  
&quot;Not a one,&quot; said the Queen. &quot;Have your lawyers call mine
  and we'll draw up a contract.&quot;  
&quot;Great,&quot; he said. &quot;In the meantime, I'd like you to accept
  a little gift. He pulled a book out of his knapsack and handed it to her.  
She looked it over. &quot;Hmm, Crinolina: A Brief Guide for Busy
      Predators  , by W.E. Coyote! Why thank you!&quot;  
&quot;Glad to be of service,&quot; said Coyote. &quot;Is, uh, dinner ready?&quot;  
&quot;Of course, you furry rascal!&quot; said the Queen. &quot;We know our
  guest very well. Let's dig in!&quot;
