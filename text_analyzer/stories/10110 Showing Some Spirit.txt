&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �We are going to be late, Grant!� Brandy called out as she closed the door to their small home.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Brandy had just finished a shift at the bank where she was a teller and was still dressed in her �professional� cream-colored blouse and grey skirt.&nbsp; She wore her blonde hair up and the reading glasses that dangling from a chain around her neck made her look more like a young librarian than anything else.&nbsp; However, her transformation from employee to bound serial-killer victim was just minutes away.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �I laid your costume for tonight on the bed,� Grant hollered from the bathroom.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �And that is why I moved in with you�, Brandy thought to herself as she made her way down the short hallway to the closed bedroom door, �at least one of the reasons.�

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She smiled to herself.&nbsp; It hadn�t taken very long to get to that big step in their lives together; only a month after the Halloween �Invasion� the previous year at The Farm.&nbsp; That is what all the bondage club members lovingly referred to it as.&nbsp; A fetishist oasis on the outskirts of town where perverts like her gathered for their shared lifestyle.&nbsp; It was an older farmhouse and barn that had been outfitted for their needs, part of a larger farm that Ed and Cindy owned and worked.&nbsp; The Farm transformed itself into �The Body Farm� every Halloween to raise money for the club and club members were encouraged to participate.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The blonde shivered with excitement.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Brandy opened the bedroom door and lying there of the bed was her black latex bodysuit, a pair of seamed, black stockings and her thigh high spiked-heeled boots.&nbsp; This was not the bloodied and torn Hooters girl outfit she was supposed to wear.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �Grant,� she hollered, �What the fuck?�

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �Change of plans, sweetheart,� Grant smiled as he came into the bedroom still drying his hair with a towel.&nbsp; 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Brandy turned around.&nbsp; Grant was naked, his large, muscled frame still glistening from the shower.&nbsp; His manhood wasn�t at attention yet but Brandy was sure that would change.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �What change?� Brandy asked, a bit pissed off by this �change.�, �I pulled coffin duty tonight and you KNOW how much I enjoy that!�

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �I think you�ll enjoy this just as much,� he flashed his toothy smile, �I have been planning it for a while.�

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Brandy narrowed her green eyes, �I am sure you have.&nbsp; It better be good.&nbsp; I have been nearly tearing myself out of my skin waiting for my turn in the coffin.&nbsp; You know, my panties are fucking soaked with anticipation.�

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �Then we better get you out of them and into something more comfortable.� 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Grumping, Brandy undressed, laying her blouse, skirt, nude-colored stockings and bra neatly on the bed.&nbsp; She knew Grant was watching her, admiring her lithe, six-foot model�s body.&nbsp; She knew he was a particular fan of her large breasts and their pale pink nipples already stiff from the day�s imaginings about this evening.&nbsp; She purposely turned away from him as she picked up her outfit for tonight.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The glossy black bodysuit smelled wonderfully of rubber as she held it up.&nbsp; It looked more like a risqu� one-piece than anything else.&nbsp; The suit had a lace-up front that exposed her cleavage and a zippered crotch so Grant could work his magic once she was dressed.&nbsp; Brandy stepped into it and pulled it up her long, slender legs before hooking her arms through it.&nbsp; The outfit hugged her wonderfully and looked as if she had painted it on.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Brandy glanced back.&nbsp; Grant�s manhood had completely come to attention.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �Better get ready, Big Boy,� Brandy purred.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ignoring her boyfriend, she sat down and pulled up each of her stockings, making sure that the seam was running straight up the back. She unzipped her shiny, spike-heeled boots and slipped them on, again luxuriating in their encasing feeling.&nbsp; The blonde got up off of the bed and looked at herself in the mirror, letting down her hair.&nbsp; She used to have it short but Grant had a ponytail fetish so she put up with the tangles and long brushings to please him.

&nbsp;&nbsp; In the mirror�s reflection, she saw her boyfriend come up from behind and embrace her, his kisses warm on her neck.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �God, I love you,� he whispered in her ear.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �I know,� she replied, turning to kiss him back.&nbsp; Their tongues danced over one another�s as he held her tightly to himself.&nbsp; He was still undressed and the smell of Irish Spring tinged the air.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �You are still not ready,� she smiled, �at least, not to go out.�

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �And neither are you,� Grant replied as he stepped away from her and to their toy drawer in the dresser.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Brandy should have guessed but deep down, she knew she would get into some bindings sometime tonight.&nbsp; She had been lusting after them all day in anticipation of coffin duty tonight.&nbsp; The remembrances of that first night that Halloween still could make her shiver with need.&nbsp; It was almost impossible for her to keep her mind on her job today knowing what she thought was in store for her this evening.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The black leather collar was the first restraint and he fastened it around her throat as if it was a string of rare pearls.&nbsp; The chrome studs and �D� rings sparkled as he tightened and locked it into place.&nbsp; Next came the head harness with the red ballgag which he eased between her lips.&nbsp; She didn�t protest that she hadn�t eaten anything since lunch but her pent-up desire eclipsed any other hunger she may have had.&nbsp; He tightened each strap lovingly as she closed her eyes and just �felt.�&nbsp; When all was snug, he pulled her hair through a metal ring in back to form a long ponytail.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �And now, for the surprise,� Grant grinned.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Brandy watched as he went to the other side of the bed and produced a large black gift bag and set it down in front of her.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �Happy early anniversary,� he whispered as he kissed her on her cheek.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Brandy pulled the bag open and took out the red tissue paper covering up her gift.&nbsp; His gesture almost brought her to tears.&nbsp; She hadn�t really thought of Halloween as their anniversary, but it was.&nbsp; She would have to be extra-special nice to him tonight when they retired to their bedroom.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The smell of new leather assaulted her as she found the black leather something residing in the bottom of the bag.&nbsp; Pulling it, she immediately knew what it was and squealed into her gag.&nbsp; It was a single-arm sheath.&nbsp; They had both wanted one for some time but they were expensive as hell.&nbsp; He must have saved up for a while to afford this.&nbsp; She threw her arms around Grant and hugged him as tight as she could.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �Let�s see how it fits.�

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Brandy handed it to her boyfriend and spun back around to face the mirror, her hands clasped in back.&nbsp; She felt him pull the leather over her hands and up her arms, sheathing them loosely as he fastened the straps over her shoulders.&nbsp; Grant then began to lace up the binder, tightening it as tight as he possibly could until he knotted it at the top.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The effect was stunning.&nbsp; It forced her already large breasts forward, making them look even larger as they strained against the latex and lacings.&nbsp; You could even see her nipples poking against it.&nbsp; Grant noticed too and reached around to give them a playful tweak. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A rush of pleasure filled her and Brandy moaned into her gag.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �We�re not done yet,� he said, turning her back around and guiding her to her small make-up table and chair.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Grant eased her into her chair and produced an inexpensive vampire make-up kit.&nbsp; Brandy never had a man do any cosmetics on her before but she trusted her man.&nbsp; He took out the applicator and ringed her eyes with a charcoal-colored eye shadow.&nbsp; After he was satisfied with the result, he trailed a little fake blood out of the corner of her mouth.&nbsp; She wondered why he hadn�t asked her to use the set of vampire fangs included in the kit.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Grant saw her eyeing the teeth, �Because the gag wouldn�t fit.�

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Brandy looked back into the mirror and saw a vampire hooker staring at her.&nbsp; She loved it.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �One last thing.&nbsp; Stand up.�

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With his help, the blonde stood up and he eased her away from the table.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �Spread them.�

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like a good obedient sub, she did as she was told, spreading her legs a far as she dared to.&nbsp; Even though she had gotten really good at walking around in spike heels while bound, she didn�t want to push her luck.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Grant knelt down and reached between her legs, pulling the zipper open and exposing her shaved puss.&nbsp; It was already glistening from her over-active imagination and ready for anything Grant would want to do to her without aid of lubrication.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her boyfriend fetched out of their toy drawer her pink butterfly vibrator, the one with a really long plug-in controller.&nbsp; He gently opened her swollen lips and nestled the butterfly in.&nbsp; Brandy felt the clips of the vibrator clamp onto her labia, making sure that it wasn�t going anywhere.&nbsp; She then felt Grant pull the cord between her ass cheeks and up the low back of the body suit.&nbsp; His warm hands reach down her back and pulled the cord tight before zipping her up again.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Grant hooked a stout chain leash to the back of her collar and fed the vibrator�s cord through the links.&nbsp; Brandy watched as he did this.&nbsp; A casual observer would miss seeing the cord within the lead.&nbsp; Last, Gant plugged the controller in.&nbsp; Her boyfriend could hold the end of her leash as well as the small controller in the same hand.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A shot of pure bliss ruptured through her as Grant turned her butterfly on.&nbsp; She sighed loudly as he went through each of the vibe�s settings before settling on a low, pulsing one.&nbsp; Brandy knew it would drive her nuts; keeping her on the edge for as long as Grant wanted her to be.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Without a word, Grant dropped the leash and began to get dressed himself.&nbsp; Brandy moaned as she closed her eyes.&nbsp; Her encased fingers were just inches from the controls as they dangled behind her.&nbsp; She could feel the tingle of her orgasm lurking just around the corner.&nbsp; She needed to unleash it; to let it run rampant through her, but she was helpless to do so.&nbsp; She couldn�t get to the controls. The vibe coldly continued its low, pulsating humming torture. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �Ready?� Grant asked as he picked up her chain.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Brandy nodded.&nbsp; She saw that Grant had dressed simply in a black pair of jeans, western boots and a black t-shirt proclaiming in bold white letters �VAMPIRE HUNTER.�&nbsp; An Indiana Jones type hat and a bandolier of wooden stakes completed the picture.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Grant guided his beautiful blonde girl out the door and towards her new Nissan.&nbsp; Normally, if he was driving they would have taken his truck, but tonight her car was more practical.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As she walked, Brandy could feel the latex pulling at her skin with every little movement, especially her nipples.&nbsp; Each tug sent flares of pleasure, not enough to set her over the edge but just enough to tease her.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Opening the door, Grant eased his captive vampire in and buckled her safety belt.&nbsp; He then produced from his back pocket a black silk scarf which he blindfolded her with before shutting the door.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her little Nissan purred to life as Grant drove.&nbsp; The blindfold intensified everything, helping the vibrator do its cunning work.&nbsp; She wondered what other people thought as they looked at her sitting there, a silk-scarf over her eyes.&nbsp; Did they avert their stares or wishing that they had her or were her?&nbsp; The thought caused her to simmer more.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �You remember what you were doing when we met?�

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �Getting tied up and mauled by you,� Brandy answered in her mind.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �You were taking a tour of the local haunted houses.&nbsp; The Body Farm just happened to be your last stop. . .lucky for me.&nbsp; I thought tonight we would do the same.&nbsp; Hit a few creepy places and check them out.�

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The thought both delighted and horrified Brandy.&nbsp; She loved to be scared within the walls of some holiday horror chamber but the thought of being seen like this. It was different being a �victim� at their own 
Haunted farm; People expected to see helpless targets of some depraved monster.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Brandy felt the car slow and stop.&nbsp; Grant removed the blindfold, revealing that they were stopped at a former Target now turned into �The 13th Mausoleum�.&nbsp; Customers, both costumed and not, stood waiting in line.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �Come on,� Grant said after opening her door and gathering her chain leash.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Brandy was hesitant but her boyfriend urged her out by pulling on her lead.&nbsp; Slowly, they made their way towards the line.&nbsp; The bound blonde could feel the ravenous eyes on her, drinking in all of her curves.&nbsp; Her �costume� left little to the imagination.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A sudden burst of pleasure tore through her as her vibrator leapt into high.&nbsp; She caught her moan before it left her throat but she stopped in her tracks just shy of the end of the line where a group of teenage couples were staring at her.&nbsp; She recovered quickly as the vibrator died down and took their place in line.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �Be glad that I didn�t put a sign on you saying �Have I sucked you yet?�.�

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Brandy frowned at him.&nbsp; Grant replied by turning the vibe on high for a moment.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The line moved quickly and soon Grant produced their tickets from his wallet.&nbsp; From the looks of it, there were several more pairs of tickets in there.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Past the front doors was a foggy cemetery complete with moss covered tombstones.&nbsp; Distant moans and screams filled the air as they walked the path.&nbsp; Brandy�s eyes were wide and she screamed as rotting arms erupted from a grave right next to her and tried to grab her.&nbsp; She screamed again when Grant turned her butterfly on high.&nbsp; A rush of burning ecstasy flared through her.&nbsp; She felt Grants hands steady her as she was being engulfed in pleasure.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then it stopped as he urged her forward.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A corpse lurched forward towards them as they continued down the fake stone path and into the open gates of a decaying mausoleum.&nbsp; The crypt was lit in a deep, bloody red as hands clawed at partially open coffins.&nbsp; One burst open at the same time Grant turned the vibe on high.&nbsp; Fear and passion churned together as Brandy writhed in her bonds, held up by Grant.&nbsp; Branding flames of pure bliss erupted in her as she moaned and bucked in her restraints even as the vibrator had stopped its buzzing.&nbsp; She recovered, looking up into Grant�s dark eyes and realizing where she was.&nbsp; They had just started what she knew was going to be a long, long evening.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The vibrator began its slow, torturous pulsing as they passed the puzzled corpse and deeper into the haunted house.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By the sixth surprise scare, it was obvious Grant had gone through this place before.&nbsp; He had timed the vibrator to go off every time a deranged maniac came at them or a spider dropped from the ceiling before them.&nbsp; The mixture of sensations was as potent as Everclear and wave after stymied wave of pleasure threatened to overwhelm Brandy, sending her into a writhing whorle.&nbsp; But Grant knew when she was about to orgasm and pulled her from the fiery brink.&nbsp; She would moan her displeasure every time.&nbsp; By the time they had gotten through the 13th Mausoleum, Brandy was ready to do ANYTHING to get into Grant�s pants and feel him inside of her.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As he buckled her moaning form into the car and put her blindfold on, he grinned.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �Only 5 more places to go.�

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One haunted house blended with another.&nbsp; She now WANTED the scares to come.&nbsp; With them came the all-too-brief bursts of pleasure.&nbsp; She was sure the smell of the rubber didn�t cover her arousal.&nbsp; The hot, prickling need swarmed through her like an army of wanton butterfly trying to burst out.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But Grant didn�t help her.&nbsp; He only tortured her more.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Brandy felt the car stop again and mewled knowing what was in store.&nbsp; He undid the scarf blindfold and revealed their next stop: The Body Farm.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �I think there is an unused coffin in the basement, sweetie, I think I can squeeze you in.�

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Brandy moaned with tired joy.&nbsp; She was getting coffin duty after all.
