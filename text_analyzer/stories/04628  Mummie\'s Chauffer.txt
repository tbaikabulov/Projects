MUMMIE'S CHAUFFER

&nbsp;

Robertson
Russell's cell phone rang as he was haranging Ned Crawford his chauffer from
the back seat. &quot;I want this car polished more, Crawford!&quot; Robertson
lectured. &quot;You're not working&nbsp; hard enough,
man.&quot;

Ned Crawford
nodded his broad black face, trying to hide a grin, as Russell continued his
screed.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;&quot;You
aren't supposed to just sit around in the corporate parking garage waiting for
me to call you to go somewhere. What a lazy Negro you are!&nbsp;It seems as if
ever since you've developed this odd relationship with my mother, you're lazier
these days.&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;&nbsp;I'm the one in charge,Crawford. My father
left the company, the money the car to ME.&quot; The chauffer nodded his head.
&quot;Yessir, Mr. Russell...Ain't that your phone?&quot; Crawford&nbsp;said
innocently.

&nbsp;

Robertson Russell answered the
phone. &quot;Robertson Russell here...oh, hello, Mummie.
I'm coming home now, we're pulling in. Crawford? But I thought it would be just
us tonight, I was going to send him home for the weekend...Yes, ma'am. I'll
tell him. Goodbye, Mummie.&quot; 

&nbsp;

Russell
harrumphed loudly as he shut off the cell. &quot;Crawford, my mother wants you
to join us for the evening, as I'm sure you knew. So we'll go in.&quot;

&nbsp;

Crawford looked
behind him, scratching his Afro as he turned off the key. &quot;Actually, Mr.
Russell, you're to change into your other clothes, there's a package at your
feet. I'll go in now, and you're to come in in about half an hour in your
little suit.&quot; As Crawford said &quot;little suit&quot; he enunciated it
with an effeminite sneer.

&nbsp;

Russell remained
silent as the black chauffer shut the car door and went into the Russell
mansion, whistling. Russell pulled the package from the back seat, and pulled
out his hated sailor suit.Slowly he began removing his business clothes, and a
tear rolled down his cheek slowly.



Robertson felt around in the
bag for&nbsp; the horrible outfit, the one with the knickerbockers and the tie,
but what came out of the bag was an even more peculiar outfit, attached to
which was a note.

&nbsp;

�Dear Bobbie�you
complain so much about your sailor suit, that I have decided that you don�t
have the maturity for such a manly little suit, so I had Ned purchase you an
outfit� for even younger boys the Buster
Brown suit. 

&nbsp;

You have been
behaving like a toddler, so you are going to wear a tunic�it�s a nice smock
which little boys were allowed to wear just before they were old enough to wear
breeches�in other words, it�s like a little dress with pantaloons. I hope you
enjoy it!&nbsp; Your sister Danielle picked it out for you in Chicago and sent it here! &nbsp;Mummie.�

&nbsp;

Oh, Danielle such
a wicked baby sister!...Bobbie was so glad that she'd
moved out of the house when she had. It had been so humiliating,
the way Mummie had so favored his younger sister. When Bobbie had been twelve
and Danielle only nine, Mummie had insisted that Bobbie be put to bed first, at
seven-thirty, right after his warm milk, while she and Danni would sit up late
and watch all the fun situation comedies. 

&nbsp;

And Danni would
be dispatched to make sure Bobbie&nbsp; was in his
jammies at seven-fifteen, while the other children were still playing in the
street. &quot;Hurry up and get&nbsp;your pajamas on&nbsp;Bobbie, I want to get
back out to play Kick the Can.&quot; This had caused Bobbie no end of
humiliating tears and resentment.

&nbsp;

But later, in
high school and college (which Mummie had insisted Bobbie attend as a commuter,
from home) Danielle became even more of a dominating influence in his life.
Whenever Bobbie had gotten upset with Mummie for not allowing him to go to a
party or watch an R rated movie, Mummie would quell his tantrum by ordering
Bobbie to strip and wear diapers. 

&nbsp;

She'd lock
all&nbsp;&nbsp;the bathroom doors and Bobbie would be forced to spend anywhere
from three days to two weeks in nappies, and his baby sister would be allowed
to change his diapers and give him hot baths and enemas.

&nbsp;

&quot;But it's
not fair, man!&quot; Bobbie would kick his legs as Danielle leaned over him,
her pink tube top bouncing. His little sister had had such a hot body, but
Bobbie'd never seen her naked, but she saw him in the&nbsp;&nbsp;buff
&nbsp;lots of times. &quot;Shut your face, Bobbie!&quot; Danielle would say.
&quot;Or I'll tie a pink ribbon to your wee- wee before re-diapering you.&quot;

&nbsp;

Oh, Bobbie could
remember&nbsp; how Danielle's elegant little white
hands with the &nbsp;long purple nails looked, rubbing baby oil around his
shaved cock and balls. If Bobbie got excited, Danielle would often pour boiling
water on his Bad Thing, as Mummie called it, to calm him down.

&nbsp;

Once, when Bobbie
had rebelled against infantilization, Danielle and her best friend Paige had
tied Bobbie to Mummie's big poster bed and had taken turns thrashing Bobbie's
bare rump with willow switches that they'd cut from the tree in the back yard
and&nbsp; soaked in the bathtub. Bobbie had screamed and cried in frustration
and agony--at the time he was twenty-one and they were eighteen...

&nbsp;

Then Paige had
forced poor Bobbie to stand in the corner with his pants down while Danielle
called their friends over for a sorority frat party...oh the agony! Bobbie had
that one thing to cheer him up...Danielle wasn't living here anymore...Mummie
and Ned would be enough. But why, oh why had Danielle purchased this
humiliating outfit?

&nbsp;

Robertson nearly
cried as he stared at the frilly collar, the pink and blue velvet jacket, and
the baggy Raggedy-Ann underwear. To replace his wing-tips, Mummie had included
lace up shoes and stockings. Robertson sighed, and began dressing.

&nbsp;

Half an hour
later, Bobbie climbed out of the big car and trotted into the house like a good
boy, entering Mummie's parlor quietly in his sailor suit and Mary Jane buckle
shoes. 

&nbsp;

Oh...there was
his beloved Mummie, her pretty, long hair askew, leaning into the arms of that
bad black &nbsp;man, Evil Uncle Ned. She'd taken down
her strict bun without him.

&nbsp;

Normally, Mummie
wore her beautiful hair in a bun all week long, tied up tight, and only on
Friday nights did she take it down, and allow Bobbie to brush it, as long as he
was a good boy, and didn't let his Bad Thing get too excited. 

&nbsp;

Mummie NEVER let
anyone but Bobbie take down her hair, but here it was all over her shoulders,
and that evil nigger, &nbsp;Uncle Ned was running his
fingers casually through Mummie's long pretty locks, and rubbing his fingers on
Mummie's bosom, encased as it was in her pretty gold lame dress.

&nbsp;

Mummie didn't
seem to see Bobbie as she breathed into Uncle Ned's face. &quot;How nice it was
for you to take down my hair for me,honey! Do you like
stroking it...it sure feels good!&quot;

&nbsp;

Bobbie was
enraged, but what could he do? He didn't want to disturb Mummie and Uncle
Ned...the last Friday night that Uncle Ned had stayed over, Bobbie had thrown a
bit of a tantrum, and Mummie had tied Bobbie down and run steel needles through
Bobbie's nipples while Uncle Ned had pushed a series of larger and larger steel
balls into Bobbie's rectum, and then enema'd them out as Bobbie'd squealed for
hours!

&nbsp;

Now Bobbie
watched Mummie sigh deeply, and kiss Uncle Ned's moustache.

Although Bobbie
was a big grown up boy, well past twenty-one, Mummie wouldn't let Bobbie grow
any facial hair, and didn't shave him either--just took poor Bobbie to the
depilatron center where all his bodily hair, including his crotch, Bad Thing
and legs was removed... 

&nbsp;

This way Mummie
could not only have Bobbie clean shaven, but once in a while, they'd play
dress-up and Mummie'd take Bobbie shopping, both ladies in miniskirts that
showed off their smooth legs! How Bobbie hated those outings, but Mummie was
sure that he really had a need to be in touch with his feminine side.

&nbsp;

But now, Bobbie
pouted as he watched his Mummie kissing hairy uncle Ned. Oh, and watch Uncle
Ned running his fingers in Mummie's cleavage!

&nbsp;&quot;Mummie&quot;Bobbie
said loudly as his hands clenched into fists, which looked a bit ridiculous in
his sailor tunic, &quot; Mummie turned from Uncle Ned
and smiled at Bobbie. 

Bobbie bit his lip
and stared into her eyes. &quot;You-you said tonight I could brush your
hair--that it would just be us!&quot; Bobbie blushed hotly. It&nbsp; was Bobbie's privilege for Friday nights, and he
might lose it...now that Uncle Ned was here.

&nbsp;

Mummie looked up
at Bobbie, her head resting on Uncle Ned's shoulder. &quot;Dear, dear
Bobbie...how cute you look in your tunic and bloomers! Doesn't he, Ned?&quot;
Uncle Ned grinned at Bobbie, who stomped his foot and stared down at his
high-laced patent leather Mary Janes. 

&nbsp;

This was a stark
contrast with Uncle Ned's black jeans and combat boots...Bobbie felt like such
a sissy, though it was better than the time Mummie had him parading about in a
sleeper pajama with a buttoned up flap in the back! 

&nbsp;

&nbsp;After a
long week of driving Master Bobbie about and listening to his chatter, Uncle
Ned was happy to see Bobbie subdued in his tunic.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;But he said
nothing, he just took Mummie's face in&nbsp; his
rough-hewn hands and gave her a deep tongue kiss. Uncle Ned took his left and
and toyed with Mummie's full, milky breast, rubbing it in and out of the dress.

&nbsp;

&quot;Look at
him, Ned&quot; Mummie motioned towards the scowling Bobbie. &quot;Pouting,
sulking. Here the boy is lu cky to have a Mummie who loves him, who knocks
herself out to provide a wonderful clean and comfortable house.&quot;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;Bobbie's
mouth dropped open. Here he came home every night and did the home
chores--Monday nights was dusting and vacuuming the house,,
Tuesdays, scrubbing the five bathrooms and kitchen.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;Mummie went
over each toilet bowl with a mirror, just to make sure her little darling
wasn't slacking off, of course. and carried her strap
with her to each room.

&nbsp;

Wednesdays Bobbie
had to scrub the walls and baseboards--and did Mummie check those over
carefully!

&nbsp;

Last week there
had been a slight mark or smudge on one baseboard and oh, there had been hell
to pay. Mummie had caned Bobbie's bare buttocks in front of his friends from
the Camera&nbsp; Club. Mummie had moved on to a short
horsewhip and raised some vicious welts and marks on Bobbie's naked cheeks, oh
so harsh.

&nbsp;

At the end of
Mummie's loving correction, Bobbie had been blubbering and weeping in front of
his sniggering- so-called friends.. &quot;But those
men didn't really care for you dear&quot; Mummie had comforted poor Bobbie
later, as she'd tended to his gluteal wounds. &quot;Real friends would have
appreciated Mummie's efforts to teach you responsibility..to
make her boy more manly, yessir.&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Why don't
you avoid those bad boys from the Camera Club, and your Stamp-Collector's
Society too-- I took the liberty of resigning for you over the phone...you can
spend more time with your beloved Mummie&quot; she'd said as she'd rubbed
Bobbie's viciously welted buttocks with soothing liniment, God bless her.

&nbsp;

&quot;Though you
certainly do cry rather easily, sweetheart...it's babyish, really.&quot;

&nbsp;

Thursdays
Mummie's after-work cleaning schedule for poor Bobbie had focused on cleaning
the windows. particularly her big picture window in
the living room. 

&nbsp;

To make sure
Bobbie didn't lollygag at this duty, and that he'd clean it as soon as
possible, Mummie had him wear a rather humiliating costume. She'd forced Bobbie
to wear the Merry Widow negligee that she'd worn on the wedding night to
Bobbie's daddy,&nbsp; now long dead.

&nbsp;&quot;I
know you hate wearing that when you're cleaning the windows darling&quot;.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;She'd once
told Bobbie &quot;But it helps you avoid dawdling at the task...the faster you
get it done, the sooner you can get your little nightgowl clad body out of the
picture window, darling.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;I know you
blushed terribly last week when those visiting Mormon girls on the street were
laughing&nbsp; through the window at you.

&nbsp;

A&nbsp;big
grown-up man who has to wear ridiculous nighties because he can't be trusted to
clean the picture window quickly otherwise.&quot;

&nbsp;

But of course
Bobbie always had to do a very thorough job there also, because Mummie, if she
found even one little smidgen of dust on the picture window after he'd cleaned,
quickly or otherwise, would be quite wrathful.

&nbsp;

Bobbie recalled
once in his senior year of high school, when he'd been forced to clean the
window wearing a bra and panty set covered with lovely bright red hearts.

&nbsp;

He'd cleaned oh
so quickly because his teammates on the varsity football squad and their
friends had been laughing over the fence at him...

&nbsp;

Mummie had found
a speck of dust and had taken poor Bobbie out into the yard and forced him to
pull down his panties, covered with hearts, and take a nasty lashing with a
thorny branch from her prize rose bush!

&nbsp;

&quot;Oh, oh
Mummie...&quot; Bobbie had screamed, bending over the fence, his panties around
his knees. WHACK LASH SWACK! Mummie's thorny stick had slashed vicious red
streaks up and down his pale buttocks and how painful it'd been!

&nbsp;

&nbsp;How the
pretty girls had laughed with their boyfriends watching the star quarterback of
James Buchanan High getting lashed like a three year old in hearts lingerie!
&quot;You are such a pathetic geek, Bobbie!&quot; Pam Collins, captain of the
cheerleading squad had laughed at the poor boy as he rolled around on the
ground in the front yard!

&nbsp;

And to think he'd
gotten so close to asking Pamela out...it had been difficult because Mummie's
bedtime for Bobbie, even at age nineteen was seven-thirty.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;Perhaps he
might've taken Pamela to an afternoon movie though...but not now...not ever!
What kind of a girl can respect a grown man who lets his mother take down his
undies and whip his buttocks in the front yard?

&nbsp;

&nbsp;And how the
guys had &nbsp;razzed him about it the 

next day&nbsp;in the locker room! A couple of
them had actually turned Bobbie over one of the benches and corn-holed him
because all he was was a pathetic sissy!

&nbsp;

But of course
Bobbie knew that Mummie only did these disciplines for Bobbie's own good, and
he was trying to learn to be more grateful for it. 

&nbsp;

On the weekends
Bobbie had been forced to work in the yard wearing a ballerina tutu, with
Mummie giving him nasty punishments for every missed weed&nbsp;
or leaf!

&nbsp;

So now Bobbie was
disbelieving when he heard Mummie telling Uncle Ned that she was responsible
for keeping Bobbie in such a lovely and comfortable clean house!

Bobbie tried to
reason with his Mummie. He knew that pointing out that she
didn't clean wouldn't help...he had to reason on her good side. &quot;But M-Mummie.&quot; Bobbie said patiently, even as he
felt his lower lip trembling, 

&nbsp;

&quot;This is our
night...I-I thought we--I would brush your hair and
then we would have cuddly num-nums...&quot; He smiled, thinking of the rare
occasions when Mummie would take her Bobbie to her bosom and let him kiss and
huddle up in there...what fun that was!

&nbsp;

&quot;Darling, as
you can see, I have company tonight.&quot; Mummie said, smiling at Bobbie.
&quot;Why don't you amuse yourself some other way...go play with your paper dolls.&quot;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;At this,
Uncle Ned burst into laughter, and Bobbie's face burned.

How could Mummie
tell Uncle Ned his secret? Bobbie didn't need the world to know that he liked
to relax and enjoy his Rita Hayworth and Esther Williams cut-out doll toys. 

&nbsp;

Mummie, despite
everything else, had always kept Bobbie's secret.

&quot;Goddamn it, Mummie!&quot; Bobbie
stamped his foot. &quot;You can't air my dirty laundry in front of my chauffer,
whatever else you do!&quot; Bobbie kicked an end table and Mummie's 1883
Egyptian vase fell off of it, and broke on the floor.

&nbsp;

At the same time Bobbie stopped,
paralyzed. Ohh God. &quot;Bobbie! Can't you control yourself better than that?&quot;
Mummie asked. &quot;To think I was going to let you brush and comb my hair
after Uncle Ned left...and I might even have allowed you to kiss my full
breasts tonight...you've been trying to be such a good boy that I might've let
you suck on my candies..but not now! Forget
it!&quot;&nbsp; Bobbie hung his head.

&nbsp;

As Bobbie stared at Mummie, she rubbed
her full breasts and smiled demurely at him. &quot;You poor thing, you'll never
get to touch my honeys now...you just don't know how to act, smashing up my
crockery, you know that?&quot; 

&nbsp;

Uncle Ned looked at Bobbie sharply.
&quot;You've upset your mother, young man...you need some correction, that's
for sure!&quot; Uncle Ned looked at Mummie and she nodded sadly, and he stood
up and began removing his belt.

&nbsp;

At first, Bobbie looked at Uncle Ned
officiously. &quot;Ned, put your belt back on, this farce has gone far enough.
I appreciate your relationship with my mother, but it doesn't give you license
to...&quot; Mummie chortled, and waved her hand to Uncle Ned. &quot;You see
what an impertinent boy my Bobbie is? You should give him a few extra licks for
that, darling Neddie.&quot;

&nbsp;

Bobbie noted that Uncle Ned now had the
belt looped in his right hand, and began pleading. &quot;P-please, don't make
Uncle Ned h-hit me...Mummie, he's the chauffer...I can't bear being punished by
him.&quot; Bobbie backed up as Uncle Ned advanced on him. Mummie shook her
head. 

&nbsp;

&quot;What a bad boy. Ned, I can't bear
to see you do this. Why don't you take Bobbie into the other room, and take
down his bloomers, and do him proud...and bring him back, darling. See if you
can enforce some sort of obedience.&quot;

&nbsp;

About midnight on the same
evening, Robertson Russell limped out of his mother's house, with Ned Crawford,
his faithful chauffer, behind him. &quot;Mister Russell, sir, it was so nice
seeing your mama again...&quot; Ned&nbsp; smiled.
&quot;I hope I didn't lay it on too hard with the belt.&quot; 

&nbsp;

Robertson Russell looked bitterly at
his chauffer &quot;Goddamnit Crawford, shut your mouth and drive me home!&quot;


&nbsp;

&quot;Sir, you know I am still wearing
my belt&quot; Crawford's white teeth gleamed in the night. &quot;I might want
to use it again...care to re-phrase your question?&quot;

&nbsp;

Burning with blushes, Robertson Russell
murmured. &quot;Uncle Neddie...please take me home now...if you want, I'll suck
your wee-wee in the front seat, Sir.&quot;

&nbsp;

The chauffer laughed. &quot;Thass mo'
like it!&quot;
