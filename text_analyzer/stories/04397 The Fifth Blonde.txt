The Fifth
Blonde

(by Eve Adorer)

&nbsp;

Chapter 1 -
Muffled

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Spindon,
the Midlands, England, once upon a time�.

&nbsp;

The presto
staccato clatter of high heels echoed the lonely all-but empty street: the
tympani of an erotic symphony played solo by a duet of dainty feet.

&nbsp;

Spindon
was as warm as Spindon ever is. Rain had reigned not
long since, with Thor�s bass drum rolls aperitif to jagged strokes slashing the
sky blinding blue-white.

&nbsp;

Prolific
litter, latterly scattering the sidewalk, now cluttered the gutter, washed
there by nature�s hopeless attempt to power-hose the Spindon
Soho district clean.

&nbsp;

The
northern hemisphere sun claimed ascendancy over the town�s slatternly summer
season. To be this dark therefore needed the early hours, with dawn, borne on
and born of the earth�s rotation, starting its post gestation parturition.

&nbsp;

There were
lights, street, jaundice-yellow, apologising for
their inadequacy. There were lights, shop, palsy-white,
left on for security and to display the tawdry wares of this locale of
despairs.

&nbsp;

Boarded
windows said shops that did not pay protection money, or else had died of
market force�s divorce from custom, and custom�s practice of now going
elsewhere.

&nbsp;

In such
shoes she could not run even though she wanted to. So she made onwards, head
down.

&nbsp;

By her not
looking up, her hallow haloed blonde head played ostrich without the sand for
such an inward outlook.

&nbsp;

In a
doorway ahead: silent shadows shouted their threat and shivered her spine. The
hairs on her slim neck rose in reflex ripple. Thank god it was only two drunken
girls drinking each other�s kisses.

&nbsp;

But fear
had demanded she assess if threat threatened, so she had dared to look
up.&nbsp; The girls she saw in the doorway, would be called �fat� by
unflattering standards that did not see the cream of their complexions, and did
not sympathise that to be so tired of life so young
spoke of society�s deepest evil.

&nbsp;

In so
looking up, she saw that, shadows despite, it was
safe; but stayed too long in stare, so the call echoed before her as she
hurried toward the kissed-in doorway:

&nbsp;

�Whadda you fuckin� starin� at?�

&nbsp;

And the
call echoed behind her as she hurried by:

&nbsp;

�Seen
enough den �ave yer?!�

�����..

&nbsp;

Spindon
Police had taken this one here as a summer casual: her and her equally pretty
friend. They were still at university. Just nineteen.
She was innocent of so much of life and, more so, of so much of love.

&nbsp;

Why me; I
don�t know.

&nbsp;

She was
tall, when I like them petite. She was blonde when I like them brunette. She
had pale blue eyes, when I love them brown. She had a full bosom for a girl
with such a slim frame, when I prefer them to contrast, not more than match my
own. But she had the cutest bum, and she knew I could not help but watch her
swing that thing when she was busy-bee about the office floor.

&nbsp;

Plain
clothes were allowed civilians like her. Me too now I was a detective sergeant
in the Criminal Investigation Department � the CID.

&nbsp;

She was a
sunny honey, with love in eyes that gleamed dreams.

&nbsp;

Why me; I
don�t know, but I knew from the fact that she and her redheaded fellow-student
silenced their chatter when I came near, only for its sweet music to charm the
air when I had gone by, that electricity was current.

&nbsp;

It was DC,
one-way, till the day she wore the dress.

&nbsp;

Angelina,
for this was she: Angelina in her tight cotton, blue cotton, cool cotton,
dress. The station house echoed bedlam as we busied with our business, but
still the hush of Angelina�s dress� hem on her sin-black nylons, as she slinked
past my desk, charged me with ecstatic static.

&nbsp;

On she wasn�t it trying, when she delivered my mail. Perhaps
that was because she was shy without her friend to goad her to exceed her confidence�s
certain competence.

&nbsp;

Her voice
was bright silk-honey with a tease of giggle.

&nbsp;

�Only two
letters today, Miss Winsome: you must be losing your popularity�.

&nbsp;

In that
instant she blushed scarlet. She was so embarrassed that the intended joke she had
rehearsed, had sounded so rude now it was delivered, that she duly flushed pink
dew rose from her forehead to her nape, and dropped her sweet eyes to say
�sorry�.

&nbsp;

Acutely shy
in pink-faced consequence, she lingered only momentarily by my desk, but the
brisk soft swish of her black nylons brushed by her dress� tight skirt, was
scent-in-sound in the sensuality with which the noise of its silence rose above
the office fray�s bray.

&nbsp;

�Truly�, I
said. �Please call me �Truly�; not �Miss Winsome��

&nbsp;

I was disappointed
at being so prosaic. DC was translating to AC currently. I was eleven-years
older than this honey-pie, but she still made me shy,
and my words thus stupidly inadequate.

&nbsp;

As she
turned away: �Thank you for the letters Angelina�, I said, following-up one
inadequacy with another even worse, for which I mentally kicked myself again.

&nbsp;

She turned
and her bottom-of-her-bottom blonde flow, momentarily curtained one shy eye as
she whispered: �You�re welcome Miss�.. Truly�, and blushed again. And a name I
had always hated, mine, had just sounded heavenly. 

�����..

&nbsp;

Angelina
was, next day subsequently, both wrong and right in her assessment. 

&nbsp;

Subliminally
sublimely she had sounded out, she thought, what had aroused my senses. That it
had been the shush of static from her tight dress on her stocking tops topped
thighs that had sent �scent� to my ears, she had not realised.

&nbsp;

She now
stood, talking to her redheaded co-conspiratorial co-concupiscent, the titian
tease Emma Eyeful. 

&nbsp;

As I walked
by, Angelina stood chatting self-consciously with her friend and fellow
student. Angelina stood in a miniskirt with her long slim legs displayed from
her ankles all-but to her nave. She stood in what I guessed must be the first
ever pair of heelless tiptoe-walk en-pointe-shoes she
had ever worn. She stood thus on tiptop tiptoe with her legs, her calf muscles
not least, in a tension of taut curves impossible to give inattention.

&nbsp;

Angelina
was thus both wrong and right in her assessment. Sublimely subliminally she had
sounded out, she thought, what would arouse me. That it would be and had been
the hush of the hem of her tight skirt on her nyloned
thighs that had sent sweet music to my ears, she had not realised;
but she was not wrong in concluding that I was a legs girl.

&nbsp;

A
significant silence descended over the vacation students� chatter as I got
closer.

&nbsp;

As I drew
close: �Good morning Truly�, an angel whispered, with
a voice that spoke too of longed-for greater confidence.

&nbsp;

�Good
morning Angelina�, I answered, as I caught her eyes, eyes that said �please
don�t hurt me�.

&nbsp;

The two
student-girls� silence continued as I carried on by to my desk. Then a sigh,
Angelina�s, and a sympathetic giggle, Emma Eyeful�s, told of love�s leaning to
keening longing.

�������..

&nbsp;

What
courage it took for Angelina to come to my desk later that morning, I only
thought about in retrospect.

&nbsp;

She
lingered by my desk, till I looked up at her shy eyes avoiding contact with
mine.

&nbsp;

�Please
could you spare a moment Truly?� Angelina concerned.

&nbsp;

From the
nervous tone of her voice, I thought she had made a huge error in her work, and
my heart went out to her.

&nbsp;

�Of course Angelina. How can I help you sweetheart?� I asked.

&nbsp;

I think I
might have misplaced them somewhere in the historic records storeroom, Truly. Honestly, I�ve searched high and low! �..� Angelina
honeyed. �I thought maybe with fresh eyes on the job we might find them� It�s
so stupid of me: they were there earlier this morning�. I�d swear they were!
��..�

&nbsp;

I pushed
aside the files I had been prioritising on my desk,
and followed her willow wand wonder, as she wove and weft her mystery before
me, her breathtaking slim legs a little unsteady, because she was constantly
tiptoe topped like a ballerina in the heelless pirouette shoes she was not yet
used to wearing.

&nbsp;

Her
sensuousness was sensational to my nose and my ears. The scent from her
burnished blonde rippling fresh washed hair, blessed the air. The �scent� of
her miniskirt caressing crisply on her nyloned thighs
sent a swish wish to my aural nerves and my clit.

&nbsp;

Angelina
let me go ahead of her into the storeroom where she had been working alone,
filing. 

&nbsp;

When
within, turning to the sound of a well-ordered well-oiled �click�, I enquired:
�What exactly is it that we are looking for Angelina?�

&nbsp;

Of course
she had locked the door. It should never have been left unlocked in the first
place. She should have locked it for security after she had broken off from her
work in there to come to my desk.

&nbsp;

Angelina
started shyly, seeming startled a little, taken by surprise.

&nbsp;

�I�m only
too happy to help; but we are very busy at the moment as you know. What exactly
are we looking for sweetheart?� I asked again of Angelina, who still stood with
her back to the locked door, and with her head momentarily lowered.

&nbsp;

When
Angelina looked up, the huge black pupils middling her China-blue eyes, were
compellingly demanding of tutelage, as she whispered, sidling slowly leggilly shyly toward me, while she blessed the air with
her sensuous sweet soprano supplication, offering me her mouth: �I think I�ve
lost my panties. I�m not sure if I�m still wearing my panties. Will you search
me Truly? �� Please ��

�����..

&nbsp;

It was time
for me to return to full duty. My twisted ankle, the ankle that had held me
deskbound, was now mended. I would like to claim injury in the line of fire,
but my tomcat would call me liar.

&nbsp;

I love to
wear heels. �Tom� loves his fish. He got his wish that day, a month ago, after
I had winced with the sharp pain. He had run and purred and weaved between my
ankles as I was walking in my kitchen with his opened food can. And, in my fear
of stepping on him, I had stumbled in my 12-inch-heeled sandals. Such is the
risk for a girl paying the dues due to her beauty.

&nbsp;

It was time
for me to return to full duty. I woke just before the aid of the alarm
sounding. It being no longer needed, I pressed it to �off�.

&nbsp;

Bar
panties, I was already naked for the shower to baptise
me. Being but for butt naked, I was cool without the bedclothes too. Perhaps
that was what had awoken me before the alarm went off.

&nbsp;

As I moved
to leave the bed, Angelina, deep asleep though she was, mumbled protest at the
disturbance, and snuggled the duvet she had already monopolised,
further over her exquisite body. Yet half her bottom was still cheekily bare,
so I leant over and gave it another kiss, and she sleep-talked a slurred, �MmmNo!�, that even yet confirmed,
�Yes�.

&nbsp;

I left my
love tumbled in the crumpled bed. It was not that she needed any beauty sleep.
But she did have her first day back in her new term at college to face that
day.

�����..

&nbsp;

Later that
same morning, at the police station �.

&nbsp;

�Welcome
back to full duty Detective Sergeant Winsome�, the Chief Inspector called from
the front of the briefing room.

&nbsp;

�Thank you
ma�am�, I answered, controlling my hatred of that jumped up tart.

&nbsp;

Fucking university graduates. What did they know about real policing? Book bashers!
Frigging useless the lot of them! Had they ever tried to control the girls in
the crowd when Spindon Vixens were playing Muncester Dikes in the soccer premiership? Had they seen
the unemployed minegirls hanging around the street
corners, living off handouts since the last colliery closed two years back? Had
they walked the beat in Spindon Soho,
and seen the skinny drug-dazed prostitutes, desperate for the money for another
fix, being eyed-up for being ripped-off by the rich bitches out for a fling
with �a bit of filth�? No. Of course they hadn�t. The cushy pen-pushers never
went out unless it was in a chauffeuse driven car!

&nbsp;

She could
have been a catwalk model too. Perhaps that added to why I hated Chief
Inspector Sonia Berkley-Hunt. She had graduated MSc
at only sixteen of course. Her doctorate had followed six-months later. Her
mind was sharper than a laser razor and her beauty could have centred the fold of �Pussy Cat� or �Slit� or any other of
the nudey girls� magazines that were top-shelf back
then.

&nbsp;

But I
begrudged her flight to height without the shite I
had had to plod through. The shite had started for me
as a mere constable eight-years since. My mother could not afford to send me to
college. I had worked behind the counter at Woolmart�s
from leaving school till I was twenty-one, and old enough to sign on with the
police force.

&nbsp;

�Now listen
up please!� Sonia called, and an attentive silence, punctuated only by
Constable Divine Legges-Walker�s nervous cough,
descended on the collegiate collectivity.

&nbsp;

�Operation
Moist Quim: you all know what it is about, and you
all know its gone total rats�, Monica began, using the condescending �common
touch� phraseology that I found another reason for my unreasonable hatred of
her.

&nbsp;

�Operation Moist Quim. Three girls have disappeared now.
We know the pattern. They are all under thirty-five, all around five-nine, all
of them blonde, all with blue eyes, and all very beautiful��.

&nbsp;

�And all
well endowed ma�am�, a sweet voice called from the back.

&nbsp;

�Just so
Constable Legges-Walker: an important common factor.
Indeed, none of the girls gone missing was less than a thirty-eight double-D or
E-cup�, Sonia agreed, with a look of embarrassment that this point � these
points? � had been raised, when she would have
preferred it � them? - inferred rather than actually said.

&nbsp;

�Of course,
they were all in their majority�, Sonia went on. �I mean they were all old
enough to vote, and thus to vote with their feet and leave Spindon
behind them.�

&nbsp;

�But we
know this is more than a mere �missing persons� matter. We know, because all
these girls were either happily married, or had a close partner. And we know,
because the wives or girlfriends they left behind, are
bereft shocked and distraught from the inexplicable disappearances.�

&nbsp;

�A French
girl, one Papillon Etalage, is the latest lovely to disappear. And this time we have
fallen slightly lucky. We have got two witnesses who saw a girl answering her
description, walking through the Spindon Soho area at three yesterday morning.�

&nbsp;

�But first,
her wife has loaned us footage, so we can see what Ms Etalage looks like�.

&nbsp;

�Constable!
�.� The constable thus nodded to by Sonia Berkley-Hunt, began to play a
wall-screen projected DVD of a stunning girl playing basketball.

&nbsp;

Sonia added
commentary to break the eerie silence: �As you�ll see, Ms Etalage perfectly fits the common
description of the uncommonly beautiful girls that have disappeared in their
turn before her�..�

&nbsp;

��..She is
keen on indoor sports ��

&nbsp;

�If that
means lovemaking, my god I bet she is!�, I thought, as I watched the brief
flickeringly visitation of the vision of loveliness that flashed onto the
screen, leaped high sky, and netted the ball, before being surrounded by the
other girls in her team, who seemed just to long to kiss her, as she shyly
giggled, putting her sweet fingers on her lovely mouth.

&nbsp;

�Unfortunately,
the footage of Ms Etalage is very brief�, Sonia confirmed, stating the obvious, �So
the constable will replay it in slow emotion �. I mean slow-motion � for you.�

&nbsp;

Of course Papillon�s face was adorably lovely, but we
all watched open mouthed, as her long strong legs loped slowly on to the
screen. And too as the bounce of the ball that announced her approaching the
net, was trounced by the double dive, and double-rebound-rise, of her heavy
heaving breasts, in the effortless flow of these, her prodigiously provocative
prominent eminences.

&nbsp;

And the
power of her legs when she leapt to basket the ball, shaped her calves to
curves beyond categorisation, bar that they were the
curves of a girl.

&nbsp;

Papillon�s breasts flowed up to heaven with her leap, and dived and
bounced within her top when the angel disappointed heaven as she reappointed
heaven on earth by landing kitten cat with her svelte lightness.

&nbsp;

The look of
joy on the faces of her teammates as they ran to kiss her,
showed how deeply she inspired love, despite that her beauty shaded every other
girl in the arena.

&nbsp;

�Thank you
constable�, Sonia�s curt tones intoned as the film clip ended again, and as:
�Thank you Papillon!� went through my mind.

&nbsp;

�Common
factors with the previous two to Ms Etalage�, Sonia announced, indicating with a pointer, a list
she had, pinned on a wallboard.

&nbsp;

�Each
received a gold garter through the post, addressed to them by name and with a
letter with the epithet: �To the most beautiful girl in the world�,
accompanying it.�

&nbsp;

�The letter
included a phone number, a different number each time, inviting the recipient
of the garter to call for an appointment at a model selection interview.�

&nbsp;

�The
condition for admission was that the garter be worn on the left thigh, and that it be displayed for the purpose of absolute
certainty of recognition by the interview team�.

&nbsp;

�The phone
numbers were untraceable beyond Buenos Aries, which they reached through god
knows how many circumlocutions, and were anyway, dodo dead by the time we got that
far round the world.�

&nbsp;

�The
interviews were at a restaurant. The restaurant was always the �La Belle
Filles�, in the French
quarter, and, lets face it, nobody in this room could afford to dine there
unless she could spare a year�s wages!�

&nbsp;

�You could,
you fucking overpaid overrated tart!� I thought.

&nbsp;

�The letter
also included free admission to a cinema. The cinema was always �Les Demoiselles�, also in the French quarter, and,
as we all know, on the edge of the Spindon Soho area.�

&nbsp;

�The
victims wore their garters, dined with their interviewers at the restaurant,
and went with their interviewers to the cinema afterwards, presumably to relax
and get to know each other with the film as a mere backdrop.�

&nbsp;

�The reason
for the invitation was stated in the letter to be: �The celebration of your
exceptional loveliness. And, above all, the honour of your overwhelming beauty gracing the pages of our
magazine�.�

&nbsp;

�They were
from non-existent addresses. A different fake address,
and a different unheard-of magazine title each time.�

&nbsp;

�We�ve
checked out the restaurant. A different name footed the bill every time. The
bill was always paid with cash, long since banked, and well beyond forensics
being able to get anything from it by now, even if we could trace any of it.�

&nbsp;

�As for the
cinema, they have a twenty-seater room they hire out
regularly to cine-enthusiasts, at one-hundred dollars a night, for a private
showing of a chosen film. Whoever hired the IntimMateLips
Studio on these two occasions, now three, did so over the internet, and left no
traceable traces.�

&nbsp;

�The films
shown there are on DVD. There is no projectionist. The customers play the film
as and when they choose. They can watch it ten times over if they wish to, as
long as the room is on hire to them for the time it would take. Meanwhile there
is a bar as a place to chat and network.�

&nbsp;

�The
pattern has been the same. The girl with the garter went into the cinema with a
gaggle of other girls. These were, presumably, her so-called �interviewers� for
the modelling assignment for the new start-up
magazine. The garter girl never came out.�

&nbsp;

�I say
�never�, but of course we have the security-cam footage of Ms Etalage coming out of the cinema. We also have footage of
other areas around the cinema and restaurant, but none that positively identifies, the previous girls, the mock-interviewers, or Ms
Etalage. The locations seem to have been chosen for
the minimality of camera surveillance.� 

&nbsp;

�Ms Etalage must have somehow evaded the girlnappers.
Maybe she excused herself to the ladies� washroom, and evaded their security by
simply not returning to her seat. She is the only one not somehow disappeared
inside the cinema itself. But they clearly got her later, in the street.�

&nbsp;

�Only after
the second disappearance did we get told. With the first one, the partner of
the missing girl concluded that her love had wanted to disappear for some
unknown reason.�

&nbsp;

�The first
two happened a week apart. This latest, only two days after
the second.�

&nbsp;

�Till we
came on the scene, nobody saw that there was a pattern.�

&nbsp;

�Unfortunately,
the report of these events happening, and our investigation and conclusion
there was a connection, came too late for a warning to have gone out that might
have saved Mademoiselle Etalage.�

&nbsp;

�Now: our
new witnesses�, Sonia went on. �Our new witnesses are two public spirited
citizens of Spindon Soho.
I�ve promised them anonymity, as they are married; but not to each other.�

&nbsp;

�Unfortunately,
our new witnesses can tell us little. They saw a girl matching the description
of Ms Etalage walking very nervously through Spindon Soho, coming from the direction of the French Quarter of Spindon. That�s all.�

&nbsp;

�The route
Ms Etalage was on, was her
way home. She never made it home. The girlnappers
must have caught up with her.�

&nbsp;

�We appear
to be talking girlnapping to order: hence the
similarities in the hair-colour complexion height and
vital statistics of these gorgeous young women.�

&nbsp;

�The constable
on the beat there was asked to retrace Ms Etalage�s
route from the cinema. She did so, and had the good sense to look for evidence,
in the unlikely places as well.�

&nbsp;

�In a
trash-can on one of the lampposts not a quarter-mile from the �Les Demoiselles� movie house, she found some
panties. They were thoroughly impregnated with the dried evidence of heavy
petting.�

&nbsp;

�Even as I
speak, these are being flown to France for the intimate DNA they contain
in abundance, to be profiled against that of Ms Etalage�s mama, a retired supermodel, now
living in Paris. We expect confirmation that the discarded panties are
indeed Ms Etalage�s.�

&nbsp;

�We have no
idea who cast them into the trash-can�, Sonia concluded.

&nbsp;

�Any ideas
about the case?� she queried.

&nbsp;

�Ideas?! �.
Anyone?� �.

&nbsp;

There was a
pregnant silence, till �.

&nbsp;

�How about
the Midnight sisters, ma�am�, I called out.

&nbsp;

�I thought
their name would come up�, Sonia dismissed.

&nbsp;

�As we all
know, Eve and Dawn Midnight flew in from New Edingow
in the USA a year since, and have had the
former Manor House in the Spindon Soho
district refurbished, to make it into a home.�

&nbsp;

�As we all
know also, Eve and Dawn have a reputation for big-time crime. But the FBI assure us that they are cleaner than a hound�s tooth.
Reputation is just that and nothing more. Besides, and, okay we did check it as
a precaution, all the evidence is that they were out of town on every occasion
of one of these occurrences. So, reputation or no reputation, Eve and Dawn
Midnight are out of this.�

&nbsp;

�And, as
for you, Detective Sergeant Winsome: you keep off the Midnight girls� grass. They�ve complained
about you snooping around near the Manor House. If you want to continue a fine
career, cut that out�, Sonia warned.

&nbsp;

�Any worthwhile ideas? �.. Someone? Anyone?�

&nbsp;

If shop
dummies could have turned their heads to give each other dumber looks than my
colleagues had on their faces at that final invitation, I would have been
surprised to see it.

&nbsp;

The
briefing fell into a shambles, and we all shuffled out, dispirited.

&nbsp;

Meanwhile,
Sonia Berkley-Hunt called me to her office, and had me
read a warning letter from Mesdames Grimm, Gavel, and Grave, Eve and Dawn
Midnight�s solicitors, complaining of harassment by an off-duty plain-clothes
police officer: to wit, me.

&nbsp;

�Whatever
you think you can achieve by poking around near the Midnight�s patch, forget it Truly�, Sonia insisted gently. �Forget it; or if this letter
gets a follow-up to the Chief Constable herself, on the same theme, I won�t be
able to save your career�, she warned.

�����..

&nbsp;

Home after
the day, feeling ultramarine, tired, and weary, I turned the key in the door of
Angelina�s apartment, only to have my heart mind and deepest soul lifted by
Angelina rushing to kiss me.

&nbsp;

�Guess
what?� she giggled and teased, without being able to wait for me to answer her,
as she danced around and spun like a top in her hyper-high excitement, and
instantly answered her own question:

&nbsp;

�Tonight!
This very night!! What do you think of �La Fille Aux Cheveux De Lin� the original movie, as
directed by Eutille Joanbergen
her very self; not the American remake but the rediscovered Eutille
Joanbergen silent original!!?�

&nbsp;

�Preceded �.. wait for it �..�, she pleaded, as she put her
pretty forefinger on the tip of my nose to tease me, taunting me with her sweet
touch to give punctuation to the point she wished to make in her lovely playful
way, and telling me thus that I risked spoiling her joy if I even so much as tried
to answer.

&nbsp;

�Wait for
it!� she teased again, this time putting her lovely finger to shush my mouth,
even as I felt tears come to my eyes for my love of this wonderful girl
prancing excitedly around me.

&nbsp;

�Preceded by dinner at �� �tara�, �tara�, �tara�, she trumpeted, in silly imitation of a triumphant
fanfare, �Preceded by dinner at �La Belle Filles�!!�

&nbsp;

�I�m going
to be a model! �I�m going to be a model! �I�m going to be a model!� she sang as
she jigged about the room flashing a letter, she teased me by not letting me
fully see.

&nbsp;

Her angelic
face frowned a little as she saw my serious look.

&nbsp;

But then
she brightened and frightened the sun�s supremacy, as she whispered: �Isn�t it
just so gorgeous?!!�, as she innocently whisked up her pleated miniskirt to
reveal a pure gold garter gently pressing the supreme wonder of her bare,
unbearably lovely, slim left thigh. Then she teased me by dancing a silly
knees-high foot wiggle cancan, before purposely falling helplessly into my
arms. 

�����..

&nbsp;

�What we
got here then?�

&nbsp;

It had been
totally stupid of me to go it alone.

&nbsp;

I had left
Angelina to get ready. I had kissed her, and lied to her, that I was going into
work later, adding that I was sure she would bowl them over at the interview.

&nbsp;

�Hope you�ll
still want to know poor little me, when you�re rich and famous!� I teased.

&nbsp;

She hugged
me, kissed me, and sighed with surrender.

&nbsp;

Back in my
own apartment, three floors up from Angelina�s, it had been decision time. 

&nbsp;

Did I tell
Angelina not to go to the interview, or did I let it go ahead so we could get
the bitches carrying out this girlnapping?

&nbsp;

How certain
was I that the Midnight sisters were behind what was going on?

&nbsp;

If I was
sure I was sure, there was no use in my telling Chief Inspector Sonia
Berkley-Hunt. My boss had already warned me to keep away from them. I would get
no support from her. Yet, if I was convinced of Eve and Dawn Midnight�s
involvement, this was my chance to prove it for once and all.

&nbsp;

I had, of
course, not been prepared to risk my love. I had made an anonymous call to a
police helpline, and followed it up with a call to a trusted colleague.

&nbsp;

Constable
Divine Legges-Walker assured me that they had had a
tip-off and would be following it up.

&nbsp;

The word
they had received � the word I had passed on anonymously � was that another
beautiful blonde would be abducted that very night:

&nbsp;

�You might
recall her�, Divine prompted, �In fact you must have come across her since she
left us to go back to college. She lives in the same apartment block as you do,
sarge. Remember those two student tarts that filled
their vacation working in our offices. The redhead and the
blonde. Well, it�s the blonde of course. The tall one?
The one that seemed to have the hots
for you. Angelina Dream?�

&nbsp;

�How are
you going about it?� I enquired, trying to disguise my anxiety, and change the
subject, as consciousness of the risk for Angelina struck me with fresh doubts
about what I was doing.

&nbsp;

�We got
everything on it we�ve got available. That includes you sarge.
The Chief Inspector wants you here pronto or sooner. We�ve been trying to raise
you this last hour or more. Where the hell have you been?�

&nbsp;

�You�re not
going to believe this, Divine, but that bloody ankle of mine has gone on me
again, damn it!� I lied.

&nbsp;

�I�m sat
here with a pack of friggin frozen peas over the
swelling. I can hardly get to the bathroom, let alone out of this apartment�, I
elaborated.

&nbsp;

�Bloody
hell sarge! We need you here right now!� Divine
moaned, as much because she preferred others to do her thinking for her as to
think for herself; unless she was being called upon to think with the mind she
had between her superb thighs that is of course.

&nbsp;

�No can
do�; I answered, �It�s bloody agony. No more high heels
for me. That�s twice I�ve twisted the same damned ankle�, I further lied.

&nbsp;

�Okay sarge. I�ll tell Sonia, but she ain�t
going to like it. For god�s sake, can you at least be ready by the phone?�
Divine pleaded.

&nbsp;

�Yes. Yes
of course. I�ll help in any way I can. You�ll have to get me on this landline
though. My mobile�s gone too. Battery won�t take a charge. I didn�t take a police-issue radio
with me either�, I was heading for a �best unsupported actress� award with
these further elaborations of my fundamental lie.

&nbsp;

It was true
that I had not got a police radio with me. My mobile I had merely turned off so
it wouldn�t give me away.

&nbsp;

I had a
plan. Now I was as sure as I could be that Angelina was safe, I had a plan.

&nbsp;

I had the
highest regard for my colleagues. I would trust Angelina to them. I had been on
such operations before. The maybe-victim was bate and no more. There would be
cops in the restaurant and hidden in the cinema. Angelina wouldn�t be touched.
The pincer would close in before anyone so much as laid an eye on one of her
lovely legs, or so I assured, and then reassured myself.

&nbsp;

But the
pinch was bound to be in the locality of the French quarter. My colleagues
would therefore probably only get the monkeys. The organ grinders could only be
tracked if one of their dogsbodies cracked in
interrogation. That could take hours or, more likely, days.

&nbsp;

The chances
of the Midnights being nabbed by my colleagues I rated slim to scintilla. I
was going to get the bitches I was certain sure were the mistressminds
behind what was going on. I was going to nail Eve and Dawn Midnight myself,
before they got word they�d been rumbled, and fled the country.

�����..

&nbsp;

�What we
got here then?�

&nbsp;

The Spindon Town Hall clock was chiming half-past the
hour as I struggled unavailing in vain with my captors.

&nbsp;

The
familiar peaceful sound of that clock knelled the end of my freedom as I was
frog-marched into Spindon�s old Manor House, the
house refurbished as a home by the Midnight sisters in an attempt to gentrify
the sewer that was the Soho district of Spindon.

&nbsp;

�What we
got here then?�

&nbsp;

I had been
grabbed from behind. I had been snooping in the garden of the Manor House, and
had been grabbed by two gorgeous strong and fit negresses keeping guard on the Midnight girls� English residence.

&nbsp;

I was now
kneeling. My arms were out straight behind me. Each of the guard girls had a
wrist and had twisted that wrist with one strong hand,
while she held me above the elbow to keep my arm locked straight with her other
hand. I had then been smart-marched into the Manor House, and my arms levered
up behind me, to make me kneel.

&nbsp;

As I knelt
leaning forward, my long blonde hair had cascaded around my face, my heavy
breasts were plunged within my white blouse to point profoundly to ground, my
micro-skirt was ridden up my strong thighs, thighs given enormity by my squat,
thighs revealing my sin-black stocking tops, and my blind-bat-black suspenders.

&nbsp;

�What we
got here then?�

&nbsp;

With my
dark-blue micro-skirt having sighed high, I felt pleasured-eyes admiring the
feminine flow of the lines of my folded legs. Somehow I then felt them stop at
the tops of my wicked-widow-black-stockings, and the exposure of my suspender
clasps on the fronts of my thighs. The eyes, I sensed stopped to ponder if I
wore panties, before adoring my breasts as they heaved heavy huge within my
shirt with my fear.

&nbsp;

�Let�s have
a good look at her�, silked
the same voice as before.

&nbsp;

One of my
captors pulled my corn crop into a stook on top of my
head, and forced my face up, despite my pulled-up arms forcing my shoulders
down.

&nbsp;

�Gorgeous! Absolutely gorgeous!�

&nbsp;

I looked up
at the feline source of the purring voice, and saw to adore, the long slim
exquisitely shapely legs of Eve Midnight.

&nbsp;

Eve wore a
black leather micro-skirt and a black leather jacket. The jacket zip was open
and her size thirty-eights D-Deed the insides of a tight black tee-shirt,
testing its tensile-strength to the precipice of asunder-rip. Her nipples were
prominent nibs, readied for scribbling love-notes in white ink, if only her
breasts had been charged with milk. The hem of her tee-shirt was fashionably
tatty, torn-off at a 45-degree diagonal, so that her smooth firm belly was half
bare.

&nbsp;

Her cute
concave navel guided my eyes up between her deep cleavage
to her imperious face. Her dark-brown eyes shone with vitality and viciousness
in competing measure. Her raven hair tumbled in helix ringlets, in the ordered
disorder that could only have originated from the most exclusive of
hairdressers. Her Everest-high cheekbones poured scorn on lesser majesty. And,
oh god, her mouth, with its negress�
lips, posies pout-poised in permanent pose proposing: �kiss me�!

&nbsp;

A door
opened behind this astounding vision, and another girl walked in, talking on
her mobile phone: �They�re all three sedated, bubble-wrapped, and crated. All
we need now is Angelina Dream, and we can get then on the truck for the
airport. That lucky Russian bitch will soon have her matching team of four blonde
ponygirl-prancers�.�

&nbsp;

This
speaker purred kitten too. This was Dawn. This was Dawn Midnight, the perfectly
identical twin, of the equally perfect Eve.

&nbsp;

These
astounding girls were twins of twenty-two, but had different birthdays. They
had been born either side of midnight, two minutes apart. Eve had been
born the day before Dawn and after dawn. Dawn had been born after Eve and
before eve.

&nbsp;

Never had
the surname �Midnight� been given more wonderful meaning and reason. It was in
their genes. The Midnight family had its genealogy, and their tree told of
many midnight births, giving the derivation of the surname of these
stunning beauties the same validity as the surname �Day�. One or both of the Midnight girls� parents bore the gene, and
they had been born around midnight as a consequence.

&nbsp;

Dawn and
Eve Midnight, both now stood before where I was still in enforced kneel, as if
in worship of them. And I saw the full majesty of the truth that was beauty,
and the beauty that was truth, as the white Eve in her black, stood alongside
the negress Dawn in her
identical clothing of contrasting white. For that too was true of these vixens
of the demimonde, that they were completely identical twins, save the grace
that had granted that Eve was white and Dawn a negress.

&nbsp;

�What we
got here then?� whispered Dawn�s divine lips, echoing her sister�s rhetorical
interrogative, as she clicked off her mobile.

&nbsp;

�What a
beauty. If I didn�t know better, I�d have thought they�d delivered blonde
number four.

&nbsp;

�You don�t
have a chance the place is surrounded by cops!� I painfully
clich�d.

&nbsp;

�I don�t
like to see you getting hurt like this�, Eve whispered as she cupped my chin in
her gentle hand, and ran her thumb sexually inquisitively over the soft lips of
my petulantly pert, firmly closed, love longing, mouth.

&nbsp;

�I�m going
to tell my heavies to let go your arms Truly, but I
don�t want no trouble from you: Okay?�

&nbsp;

I felt the
pain in my shoulders increase, as my arms were forced further up, and me
further down, to remind me of the power held over me and: �Okay, okay, okay!� I
gasped, my tone intoning: �Oh god let me go!�.

&nbsp;

I was then
released. As I rose to stand on my twelve-inch heeled booties, two exceptionally
lovely hands, one black and one white, took one each of mine.

&nbsp;

After the
twins had helped me rise, I stood, rubbing my arms, in alternate turn, at their
respective triceps, to ease the ache from my being girlhandled
so forcefully.

&nbsp;

�I am
Detective Sergeant Truly Winsome of Spindon CID. I am
spearhead of a raid on this house. You would be wise
to surrender yourselves to me!� I winced unconvincingly.

&nbsp;

Then the
rest of my intended words were lost in an intense mumbled struggle followed by
a silence enforced by a gentle black hand that caressed my face, and then held
my neck at back to force me to kiss Dawn Midnight, and by my melting utter
butter, as she moulded her mouth around my
unwillingly willing lips, till the thrilling tingle in my racing pulses made my
eyes close in complete surrender, and my mouth answer with all my heart�s
passion.

&nbsp;

�You�re a
girl first and a copper way second�, Dawn taunted, confident in her alarming
sexual charms, as she let me go and Eve took over the kiss. And the wanton wetness
in my tunnel of love told the tale of my feminine betrayal, even as my clit
tolled too like a wedding bell�s knell.

&nbsp;

I was
losing it fast. I had to get a grip on my physical and spiritual body. I had to
have command over my heart from my head and not from between my legs.

&nbsp;

Anaesthetised by their kisses I was in serene stun, as Dawn ran her inquisitively
enquiring hands over my blouse and then patted my buttocks.

&nbsp;

�She�s
clean. She�s only got her girl�s weapons�, Dawn teased, as she looked at my eyes:
eyes misty with mystification that I could so surrender at the behest of two of
the best kisses I had ever tasted, and more so at my longing for more such, and
a tonguing.

&nbsp;

�You are
under arrest�.� I reflexed from somewhere in my
subconscious, only to have Dawn lean forward and gently kiss my forehead to
keep me poleaxed.

&nbsp;

�Of course
we are sweetheart�, she teased.

&nbsp;

�What about
the snatch?� Eve pointedly reminded, �She might have a shooter hidden up her.�

&nbsp;

�Yea� Dawn
agreed.

&nbsp;

�Okay
Truly, I want you to lower your panties, and no quick moves, cos if you do got a gun holstered up there, we�ll use it on
you for sure�, Eve drawled.

&nbsp;

As I slowly
lifted the hem of my skirt up my thighs, to reveal my potent-purse-pouched
translucent white thong, I watched the twins exchange affirmative glances
confirmatory of their admiration of the longing of my legs, the sighs of my
thighs, and their joy at seeing, through my panties, that there was nothing to
see, but that I was shaven as smooth as a pre-pubescent innocent.

&nbsp;

I was now
proud that my body was arousing these heavenly satans to the parallel of the passion that their
compassionate kisses had encompassed me hopelessly lost within for them.

&nbsp;

As I
stepped out of my thong after lowering it to my ankles, I prayed they would not
feel me to find if or not I had a pistol hidden in my she, as I knew they would
find the moisture, portrayal of my muff�s betrayal, as it prayed I might fall
prey to these delectable devils.

&nbsp;

�Are you
packing a rod in your cunt, Truly?�
Eve insisted.

&nbsp;

�No� I
answered.

&nbsp;

�Shall she
show us her pink, so we can be sure?� Dawn asked her elder twin.

&nbsp;

�No. I
think she knows where we�re at. You wouldn�t be so
stupid as to lie, would you Truly?� Eve insisted.

&nbsp;

�No. I�m
not armed�, I hoarsed with my passion for another
kiss unbidden unhidden.

&nbsp;

�Why don�t
we give her the old �spit-roast�? She�s begging for it� Dawn drawled, licking
her lips to moist beacons beckoning for the reckoning of
reckless reconnoitre of my betraying body.

&nbsp;

�Yea�
smoothed Eve, as she eyed me top to toe and toe to top, while I shook my blonde
mop to let her see the grace of my face, and lowered my light-blue lamps in
shame at the fevered feelings I was fermenting.

&nbsp;

�You�ve got
it coming you horny bitch. We�ll teach you not to nipple-in where you�re not
wanted,� Dawn sneered, but with a slur inferring her own desires were as
aroused as my own, even though, with me, it had taken the actuality of my
captivity to make me realise my sexuality�s fullest
capacity had this category of catalyst.

&nbsp;

�Get
yourself stripped bitch, but leave the heels on, so we can see your fucking
beautiful legs at their very best�, Dawn ordered.

&nbsp;

I was slow
to obey. It was not out of rebellion or lack of wanting to be their slave. It
was out of need to savour the flavour
of the moment: the moment of my realising that I was
submissive, and longing for a lesson to be taught me.

&nbsp;

But new fervour entered my fever as my dilatoriness caused Dawn to
rip my blouse asunder so that, with buttons ballistic, my gentle breasts were
flung softly wide aside and side-to-side, exposing the super-erect stature of
my nipples, confirming my growing arousal.

&nbsp;

�One each?�
whispered Dawn, and their mouths were on me and suckling on my virgin-firm
breasts, even as I gently put my trembling hands on the backs of the exquisite
raven curls of the twins� pharaoheon heads, while I
sexually mothered their desire for my body, by letting them suck my nipples to
new lengths of height, and new heights of length, new peaks of stiffness, and
new stiffness of peaks.

&nbsp;

They could
take the time they wanted in sucking my nipples. It would never be too long or
too short a time for me. If they went on long or short it showed they had mistressy over me, and that was
what I wanted in deed, and needed indeed.

&nbsp;

I wanted
these girls to rape me. I needed these girls to rape me. I wanted them to use
me, abuse me, and discard me. I needed them to use me, abuse me, and discard
me. If they wanted to slap me around, all the better.
I wanted the rape to last forever and yet, at one and the same time, for it to
be nasty brutal and short.

&nbsp;

If they
wanted to give me pleasure I would cum. If they wanted to deny me pleasure I
would enjoy it just as more.

&nbsp;

I wanted to
be broken by them. I wanted to be soiled and sullied and slapped like a
slattern slapper.

&nbsp;

As Dawn
undid the buckle of my belt to drop my skirt to my ankles and rip off the
remnants of my blouse, I longed that she might whip me with the buckle across
my bare back till it bled, but I was silent other than to utter the moans that
utterly uttered the true meaning of me, as my nipples were sucked to eternity�s
rapture by their second suckling from the eager Eve�s capture.

&nbsp;

�Let�s have
her mouth then� came Dawn�s honey purr from behind me,
as Eve bade me step out of my ankle encumbering dropped skirt, and turn.

&nbsp;

Somehow,
despite my impassioned irrational arousal, even as I turned in eager eyes-closed
dream, I heard the Spindon Town Hall clock chime the present hour, only
to cream as I screamed with astonishment when I saw Dawn�s hugely erect cock.

&nbsp;

Dawn had
fifteen-inches of erect cock she was masturbating to attention, whilst gorging
on the glory of my body! She wanted me bent forward so her cock could taste my
hot virgin mouth.

&nbsp;

Oh god I
had not known this! I had not known the Midnight twins were hermaphrodite! They were
girl-boys, more girl than boy except where it mattered right now. I was an all-girl
girl, and, faced with Dawn�s massive matter, I backed away in shock and awe,
but to no avail.

&nbsp;

Eve took my
hair and grabbed it to hold my head till Dawn�s cock was on my lips, and I was,
microseconds later, choking as Dawn rammed it over my tongue and deep down my
throat.

&nbsp;

I struggled
for air but my fight only excited Dawn the more as she worked my mouth with her
cock, whilst her sister spat in my anus, to ready it for her cock�s intern in
turn.

&nbsp;

As Dawn
grabbed my hair and twisted it to a knot in her fist, to hold my head steady so
she could use my mouth as a tool for her sole pleasure, never had I felt such
pain as Eve�s fifteen-inch penis forced open the tight ring of my sphincter.
But my scream was muffled and only served to service Dawn�s end�s ends, as her
end was still deep down my throat.

&nbsp;

I was being
�spit-roasted�. I was on the �spit�. I had one cock down my throat and another
in my anus, and it was, and I was in, ecstasy.

&nbsp;

Eve and
Dawn took my hands and gently hammerlocked my arms at
my shoulder blades as they played seesaw in slow session in their possession of
my passion holes, with first Dawn down my throat and back to my tongue, and
then Eve up my bum and then back to the rim of my sphincter.

&nbsp;

And then
they united to fill me in unison, so that I had their cocks down me and up me
in union, and up me and down me as two and one, using me as a classic
�spit-roast� host.

&nbsp;

I tried so
to tell them I had lied, but my cries were muffled by my garbled gargled
gurgles, as I choked and garble gabble gargled in reflex with Dawn�s huge cock
with its rolled back foreskin filling my glottis with its throbbing head, so
that its withdrawal drew the wind from my lungs, and my pretty nostrils flared
in despair of air.

&nbsp;

Yet, even
as Dawn�s withdrawal drew up vile bile and I wretched with the shear size and
length of her invasion, I wanted my mouth to please.

&nbsp;

When my
bile was sucked up, I wanted her cock out of my mouth so that I could spit this
sickening salty saliva out. But I knew she was still going to ride inside me
despite my protests, and even more so because I fought. So I must suffer as my
hot tongue caressed the endless length of Dawn�s penis when it pumped back into
me and drove my hot bile out of my nose.

&nbsp;

My tears
teetered brink my eyes as Dawn rode me without mercy let alone a chance to say
what needed to be said about my lie.

&nbsp;

With Dawn�s
cock past my tonsils, I rose above the fear I would choke, even though she held
my head hard up with her cock right down my neck so that I began to fight for
my right to breath, as my tits shook and shuddered
with my leaving of consciousness.

&nbsp;

But, even
as I thought I was dying, my tongue knew new pleasing measure for Dawn�s pleasure,
as my head swam and my mind floated to knew heights of consciousness of the
treasonous pleasures treasured by my sexual-self from my asphyxiation.

&nbsp;

I knew I
was being deliberately choked to a half-death to make me compliant with
pleasuring the client that was using my mouth as if it were a she, so that my
tongue would dance like an ululating snake on Dawn�s erect state as it plunged
and plundered down and up, and down and deeper down my helplessly willing
throat.

&nbsp;

�Oh fucking
shit, she gives great head!!� Dawn said as she wiped my wet and willing mouth
lips with her dark red warhead, before plumbing new depths of my throat to
choke me once more.

&nbsp;

My mind
blown by my slow asphyxiation, I felt the heaven of Eve�s cock sliding measuredly within my colon as balm and bliss as against the
blitzkrieg kiss of the cock in my mouth.

&nbsp;

Eve�s love
was elemental and gentle as her cock savoured the
chocolate flavour of the hole she favoured
in me.

&nbsp;

My bum had
not known love before, and my sphincter was tight, even after it had given up
the fight to stop the persuasion of Eve�s pleasure-ground bound fifteen-inch
invasion.

&nbsp;

My lovely
bum had always excited the girls. And how jealous they would be to see that Eve
had the tool with which to take toll on the hole that all of my girlfriends had
lingered long in, longing with finger, as they wished they had Eve�s pole with
which to rule and tell my bum not to be so sexy, if it didn�t nextly want to have a shit coated cock forced into my mouth
to punish me for my wanton wriggle wiggles when I walked.

&nbsp;

But even as
Dawn fucked my mouth as if it were the she of a streetwalking trollop she would
use without concern as a depository for her sperm, I longed for Eve�s more
gentle penetration in my oral orifice and Dawn to slap my bum with her balls as
she raided my anus like an irate pirate.

&nbsp;

My bum and
my mouth were not made for this kind of love. And yet, because they were not
made for what they were being used for, they were just the right holes two too
for the Midnight�s to take, to teach me my mistake of thinking I could take
them alone: a thought I had soon forgotten as they continued to savage my mouth
and my bottom, raking me with rape for my mistake�s sake.

&nbsp;

The second
round of bile pulled up by Dawn�s plunder of my mouth, was viler than the
first. And yet the state of my surrender by now was such that I welcomed the
foulness, as her cock syringed my throat again, and the bile pissed
nauseatingly out of my nostrils.

&nbsp;

And I began
to wretch and my tongue to flicker like a dervish at death�s door.

&nbsp;

�Oh god
she�s a fucking horny whore!!!� Dawn hollered.

&nbsp;

�Ride her
cowgirl!! You got your cock in her saddle! What�s her beautiful fucking bum
like for fucking? Fucking beautiful?� Dawn gasped between-whiles as she enjoyed
my half-death choking on her poking pole far down my throat hole.

&nbsp;

Eve�s cock
still made cockhorse whore of my anus as she rode the range spurred on by her
longing to jerk and spurt inside my sexy pert bum with her potent seed cum.

&nbsp;

�She�s as
smooth as satin and silk. She needs to be rode fucking bucking bronco pronto!!�
Eve opined to insult my mind.

&nbsp;

�You take
her saddle while I feed her chocolate sauce as her next course!� Eve sneered,
intentionally for me to have heard every word, so as to turn me on to the slut
I was being taken for and used as: to abase me, and rouse me as they knew now
my want to pleasure, was from my massive submissive need to please.

&nbsp;

My need to
tell that I had lied was forgotten as my plunderers withdrew, and I gasped for
air: air that had never had more wonderful fragrance, as my swimming head was
still filled with the circling sparkling stars that danced before my eyes from
Dawn�s penis throttling me with its relentlessly deep and ever deeper choking
poking.

&nbsp;

I was unphased by the switch around. I was only too eager to
taste my brownie.

&nbsp;

As,
lubricated by my spittle and bile on her hugely distended cock, Dawn slid slap
deep into my bum to ride me hard, bareback bronco break, holding my hips, as
Eve let me know what she intended, and what it impended, by up-ending her cock
so I could smell my fresh shit on her shaft.

&nbsp;

Eve swung
her hips side to side and her cock slapped my face cheek as she hissed: �Lick
it you whore. Lick your shit off my shaft!�

&nbsp;

And where
once I would have recoiled with nausea, I now moaned with joy.

&nbsp;

Eve did not
need to order me to be eager, for my tongue was on the tense tautness of her
issue tissue, and my lips kissing the brownie off its tip, finishing with an
extra succulent kiss to suck the shit out from the recess of her septum.

&nbsp;

�There�s a
good girl�, Eve menaced, to knowingly arouse me more, as she slid her now
pristine clean shaft down my throat, and the twins once more seesawed and
jointly worked me �spit-roast� once again.

&nbsp;

As Eve and
Dawn Midnight rode me, time stood still; for what bestrode me was more
compelling than love alone. I had grown to thirty-years and yet only now
discovered that I needed this. This physical hell was physic of heaven. All I
wanted now was that they cock my she.

&nbsp;

All I
wanted now was that they cock my cunt. I was pouring
my musk in excess of largesse, but I knew I had no right to ask that they enter
my sin.

&nbsp;

In the hour
for which the Midnight twins had been �spit-roasting� me, an hour I knew only
as an eternity I wanted to have endlessly without end, I had learned that mine
was to be used and abused, and that the divine rights belonged only to these
hermaphrodite queen-kings.

&nbsp;

I could not
define what I wanted. I had to pray they would divine what I wanted, and that
what I wanted coincided with what they decided I needed divided, in their free
choice of my three tight orifices. 

�����..

&nbsp;

At the
bursting open of the doors, and the shout of: �Armed police: Freeze!� an
angelic beauty with a gold garter around her tear-rendingly-beautiful
slim left thigh, saw me eagerly bent over, in just my devil-black-suspenders,
blackguard-black-stockings, and twelve-inch heels, with Eve�s fifteen-inch cock
right down my eager throat, and Dawn�s just withdrawing from my red-hot
bum-pot.

&nbsp;

�Truly!
Oh god Truly! How could you?! How could you?!�
Angelina screamed, as she saw, and then ran straight back out of the door and
into the distant shiver of the velvet night.

&nbsp;

�Armed police: Freeze!� Chief Inspector Sonia Berkley-Hunt shouted once more.

&nbsp;

At which
call, as Dawn reflexed upright, her hugely erect
enormity, held on the verge of at long last entering my she, slid into my sluts
slaverings and met with the cold resistance of the
butt of my secreted one-shot derringer: the illegal pistol I carried for self-defence: the seat and site of my lie. And the muffled sound
of the explosion within my muff, told of the lead-semen that had
instantaneously ejaculated from the barrel of that pistol, its cock-sure
hair-trigger all too eager to complete my intense intercourse, by deflowering
me with a bullet, so that I fell to the floor screaming, writhing my beautiful
legs eye-compelling orgasmically erotically, in
agony, even as I rode the rough road of my unrivalled unbridled unbearable cums: a cum for every stroke of the Spindon
Town Hall clock, as it chimed out the coming of, and my cumming
too, to murderous midnight�

�����..

&nbsp;

Outside in
the background-silent cold distant, the presto staccato clatter of high heels
echoed the lonely street: the tympani of an erotic symphony played solo by a
duet of dainty feet, as Angelina, her face an ocean of tears for her
emotionally imagined miserable years, wonder-wiggled, wandering lonely into the
bite of Spindon�s empty night�

The Fifth
Blonde

(by Eve Adorer)

&nbsp;

Chapter 2 �
Etiquette

&nbsp;

My stay in
hospital was brief. As part of the diplomatic hushing-up of the incidents in
the Spindon Soho Manor
House, the Midnights paid for the operation I needed to remove a bullet.

&nbsp;

The �Corps Diplomatique� plates on the front of the Midnight twins� her and his / his and hers
matching Ferraris saw them granted immunity, where persona non grata should have played trump card.

&nbsp;

However
tentative the connection of Eve and Dawn Midnight with the US Embassy in
reality, the English government again deluded itself that England mattered to the USA, and wanted no boats rocked, for
risk of ties broken.

&nbsp;

The two
English Rose blondes, and the superlatively lovely blonde French girl, Mademoiselle
Papillon Etalage, were
released from the wooden crates in which their exquisite naked bodies were
crouched foetus.

&nbsp;

Bandaged in
bubble-wrap so that �the fruit� would not be bruised in transit, they had been
injected to make them sleep for the road, flight, rail, and road again journey
to St
  Petersburg. Had they and my lovely Angelina Dream been delivered by
freight as per the Midnight twins� contract, the four stunning blondes were to
have been broken to harness, and made to pull a countess� ponygirl-sled,
naked in the Russian winter snows.

&nbsp;

My stay in
hospital was brief. As part of the diplomatic hushing-up of the incidents in
the Spindon Soho Manor
House, the Midnights paid for the operation I needed to remove a bullet.

&nbsp;

My surgeon
assured me that I was �a lucky wee girly�, as her
cheerful Scottish accent announcedly pronounced it.
Indeed, I had been lucky. Though at first the surgeons had concluded that they
would have to infibulate me, microsurgery proved possible, and there was no
irreparable damage.

&nbsp;

Swimming
and daily use of a vibrating dildo, to stimulate my nerve endings, were
recommended for my recovery to full fitness.

&nbsp;

And only
that, almost only that, was how I found myself, my full-on bosom threatening to
overspill my blue bikini�s bra, my breasts and my bottom as brown as my legs,
since I had also sunbathed naked, lounging at the side of a pool in Neliga Spain: the pool of yet another of the Midnight
girls� residences.

&nbsp;

Recuperation
was one reason for my being in sunny Spain; the other was a visit I had had
when in hospital.

&nbsp;

Chief
Inspector Sonia Berkley-Hunt began her bedside chat with me, with the
understatement of any year:

&nbsp;

�I know you
and I have not exactly hit it off with each other, Truly,
but I hope you know I respect your good old fashioned copper�s gut instincts�.

&nbsp;

�You were
right about the Midnight girls. But you were wrong to go it alone like that.
I know it was only because you are the consummate dedicated copper that you did
that silly solo on me.�

&nbsp;

�You should
have trusted us. We had it tabbed. I didn�t want you involved because we knew
of your relationship with that lovely creature, Angelina Dream. I wanted you
based at the police station so we wouldn�t have your understandable emotions
getting in the way.�

&nbsp;

�What do
you mean, �we knew�? Who is �we� ma�am?� I challenged, as my heart pinged a
pang of pain at the thought of my loss of sweet Angelina.

&nbsp;

�MI8�,
Sonia replied, casually.

&nbsp;

�What the
hell would Military Intelligence be doing in on this?�
I challenged.

&nbsp;

�When we
raided the Manor House, we had a squadron of the SGS on hand. The Special Girl
Service troopettes were going to freight the Midnights out in two of the Midnights� own crates, to a destination they
would never reach, because their crates would, unfortunately, fall out of the
aircraft halfway over the Atlantic.�

&nbsp;

�But that�s
just evil!� I whispered, aghast.

&nbsp;

�No more
evil than the Midnights. Sometimes evil is necessary in the defence
of democracy�, Sonia responded in a resigned tone.

&nbsp;

�If you
hadn�t got wounded, we could have carried it through. As it was, the SGS
arrival helicopter was diverted to fly you to hospital instead�, Sonia
semi-concluded.

&nbsp;

�With it
all becoming public, the Midnights were forced to leave England for a while. Because of the
diplomatic stink, they were obliged to pay your medicare,
as the least gesture they could make.�

&nbsp;

Sonia
paused, but I knew I should not interrupt the gap. It was a conversational lull
but a meaningful lull. Significance can often be communicated non-verbally. I
sensed she was about to impart import. I was not wrong.

&nbsp;

�To come
straight to the point, we want you to do an undercover for us Truly. We want you to do a Jane Bond for us�, Sonia
continued, as if I should have expected her to ask, indeed as if she had been
easing me toward this, instead of her springing it on me mousetrap.

&nbsp;

�Officially,
you�re out of the police, retired on medical grounds. Not that there are any
real medical grounds thank god. But that�s the front. In reality, you�ve got
yourself a transfer to MI8 if you want to take it. I know we can rely on you�,
she flattered to succeed, she hoped.

&nbsp;

�They need
someone on the inside gathering data on the next major caper the Midnight twins have lined up. You get to
know the where, when, who, and why; and we, MI8 and the police that is, will
catch those bitches red-handed.�

&nbsp;

�You�ll
have some training from MI8, and be taught how to communicate feedback. They�ll
explain�.�

&nbsp;

�You surely
want your own back for the Midnight bitches raping you like that.
You�ve got an intro to their circle. They�re advertising for a chauffeuse. The interview is in London Saturday week. You�re old enough to
have learned to drive before the petrol began to cost a life-savings per
gallon�.�

&nbsp;

�That was
no rape�, I thought as I recalled my eagerness for the aggressive ingress and
egress of the Midnights� cocks shafting my front and rear. Nor, I thought, would
the Midnights want anything more to do with me, unless they were convinced I
was a convert to their side, or at least they could see through anything I
might be set up to try.

&nbsp;

But this
�medical-grounds enforced retirement� scene just might wash with them. They�d
think it was at one with the diplomatic cover-up. They would be likely to
conclude that my �retirement� was a cover-up in itself: that I was not so much
being retired, but dismissed from the police service for �conduct unbecoming a
serving officer of the law�.

&nbsp;

After all,
if the police threw me out in a blaze of publicity, that
would create the diplomatic stink that the English and US authorities were trying to avoid.
Was this a double-bluff or a triple one? Whatever. It
just might work!

&nbsp;

Furthermore,
the Midnights, if they thought about it at all, could easily conclude
that, after all my years of service, I would be bitter at this disguised
dismissal from the force: a dismissal being a dismissal no matter how it is
excused. And that, in consequence, they could use me in their service without
concern. It just might work!

&nbsp;

It was not
difficult to work out that Sonia Berkley-Hunt had reached the same multi-bluff
style conclusions, even if she was saying everything else but.

&nbsp;

�Okay�, I
said. �I�m your girl. When do I start?�

�����..

&nbsp;

Spindon
was once more a railway town.

&nbsp;

The
coalmines had closed two-years since. It was not that coal had run out as well
as the oil. England had plenty of coal. It was just
that English Collieries Incorporated found the cost per tonne
of extracting coal was greater in Spindon than the
market sale price. The seams were too difficult for the miner-girls to get at
with the pickaxes and shovels it seems.

&nbsp;

The closure
of the �Spindon Rump�, and �Spindon
Minge� tunnels had thrown a lot of girls out of work.

&nbsp;

But
government investment in re-establishing the steam railway-engine building
factory at Spindon, was just beginning to bring benefits. One day, its
trickle-down effect on the Spindon economy might even
lift the depression in the Spindon Soho area; but it was better not to hold one�s breath in hope of that one.

&nbsp;

Petroleum
gas had become the new nectar for the gods. Nobody but the rich could afford it
anymore. Even the English queen rode in a carriage pulled by a team of twelve ponygirls. It was not, of course, that English royalty
could not afford gas, but rather that they must show their subjects that they
too were sharing the suffering from the fuel shortage.

&nbsp;

Spindon
City Station was busy with commuter-girls, many in their Ahanemi
styled business suits, with pinstriped jackets and matching micro-miniskirts.

&nbsp;

Exposed
stocking tops and visible suspender clasps were the new fashion.

&nbsp;

I just
loved the new fashion, especially since tiptop-tiptoe heelless ballet shoes,
also now �in� fashion-wise, had got all the girls walking permanent pirouette
en pointe on the squared-off toes of their shoes.

&nbsp;

At thirty,
a girl can choose to look maturely beautiful or take the risk of going with the
sweet young teens. I had the legs for the en pointe
squared-toed tiptoe-top shoes, but I preferred my underwear under where it was
a mystery, rather than have my suspenders running down the front of my thighs
for all the world to see.

&nbsp;

For my
interview, I�d raided my wardrobe for a scarlet woven-wool jacket and matching
miniskirt. This went with a pure silk blouse in saffron. Okay, so I was wearing
no bra and only an itsy-bitsy scarlet thong, but you don�t need to tell the
world about that, unless you really want to make me blush!

&nbsp;

I could at
least follow the new fashion panties wise. Madame Aesop�s fabulous underwear was all
the rage. Whether I was wise to wear one of her little apologies for a thong,
such as I had on for the first time that morning, was something I was wondering
about though.

&nbsp;

It was too
late now. I�d taken a rickshaw to the station, a rickshaw pulled by a stunning
brunette incidentally, and it was too late to go home and change. My train was near
due. I had to get this service or miss my interview.

&nbsp;

But back to
my thong: I knew the teenaged girlies loved to wear these daring baring little
strips of material, with the crutch that was worn inside one�s she lips, but
when you�re fully shaven, as I always am, and it�s a cool breezy morning, one
might as well be without panties at all as wear one of these so-called
diphthongs to keep one�s purse warm.

&nbsp;

I�d upped
my hair into a ponytail. It enhanced the view of my high cheekbones. Girls have
told me that to have my hair up like that makes me look haughty or severe, like
as if I were a dominatrix. I do so hope not. All I intended was to look as if I
was what I was, a mature and experienced woman seeking to pass an interview to
become a chauffeuse.

&nbsp;

Okay, so I
was now working for Military Intelligence 8, the number eight�s curves telling
the tale, that MI8 looked into the shapelier problems in the world: naughty
girls. 

&nbsp;

But I was
relaxed about my undercover mission. If I�d thought about it overlong, I�d have
given myself away by acting nervous and obvious, as if I were on a lie detector&nbsp; already, even without actually having my nipples
wired up to one.

&nbsp;

The best
choice for me was to relax. I had been to the gymnasium yet again that morning
and worked off my worries boxing the punch-ball and running the treadmill. I
was in great shape now. My injury from the bullet gave no problems at all. I
was in great shape: and what a shape my shape was. My shape was all woman.

&nbsp;

Now I was
thirty, though I was still an all-oestrogen girl, I
needed to exercise more to keep my figure the full dizzy eye site for the
eyesight. Though I say it myself, no roller coaster could match the hills and
dales the pupils would ride over my body. And none of my curves were in the wrong
role.

&nbsp;

Walking my
natural feline swing-step along the station platform above the rail line that
morn, my eye caught brief sight of the longest of long legs on the stoker in
the cab of the engine pulling my intended train.

&nbsp;

Charged as
she was with loading coal from the tender into the fire to create the steam for
the driver engineer, hers was hot physical work.

&nbsp;

So hot and
sweaty was she from the furnace she faced feeding with her shovel-loads of
coal, she had stripped to just her g-string. Resting while the train was in the
station, she presently had her coal-dirtied tee-shirt around her neck. As I
passed by, her smile was adorable. Her face and near-naked body coated with the
smears of coal and smoke mingled with her sweat, she was using her tee-shirt to
wipe perspiration from her forehead; her thus uplifted breasts waved a warm
welcome as I slinked cool-cat past her. 

�����..

&nbsp;

I had
forgotten it was the school vacation.

&nbsp;

She was on
her way home from living-in at a private school. I saw the badge over the holy
hillock of her gentle left breast. I willingly reminded myself of a familiar
school motto scribed in red gothic script in a diagonal strip across the
shield-shaped badge, embroidered on the vestal vest invested by her chest: �Non
Possumus�. Under it, was the institutional name: �Thornyclit College�

&nbsp;

She was �gaol-bate�. She was �old enough to know, but not old enough
to go�.

&nbsp;

She was a
teenage teaser too. She was asleep with her ravishing red curls tumbled into a
coiled copper whirlpool outshining lovelight on the
spare seat alongside her.

&nbsp;

A glimpse
showed she wore no bra, nor needed one: she was affirmatively firm. Moreover,
that glimpse saw too that her vest was not tentative about the tents that her
tits and nipples teased taut tepee materially in its material, twice over.

&nbsp;

If the
girls in her class had been competing to see who dared wear the shortest skirt,
she had surely won hands down and hem up.

&nbsp;

Like me,
she wore steel toecapped ballet-shoes. Her white
smooth slim curvaceous legs were bare, and so, oh god, so were most of her
fulsome thighs.

&nbsp;

She wore
only nature�s makeup. Her face was a frolic of freckles, her mouth a rosebud,
with mirror moist lips: those lips the coral one just knew matched her nipples.

&nbsp;

She was
half asleep, or pretend-asleep, in the seat opposite mine, but I knew she had
seen me slide into my place in the train carriage for the journey, and that she
liked an older girl ogling her, because she reached up the loveliest of hands,
and lifted her curls aside from curtaining one of her momentarily half-opened
honey-coloured eyes.

&nbsp;

And, as she
did so, she smiled knowingly to herself and the world, and crossed her legs to
show me her full left thigh, right up to where it became very cheeky. Was this
to tease me, please me, and raise the question my fore-mind would not admit I
was asking: the question whether she was wearing any knickers?

&nbsp;

My pretence
that I was not admiring this kitten only told her subliminal consciousness that
I was captivated, and the smile that crossed her lips said she knew I was
smitten.

&nbsp;

I took out
my book. I must pay my attention emphatically to it, and not the clit-tease!

&nbsp;

I was
reading an Eve Adorer novel: �Belgian Handmaid�. I�d read several of Adorer�s
works. They were alright after a fashion: a bit of light reading; nothing
special. I had problems with her use of English. More like abuse if you ask me!

&nbsp;

And,
talking of abuse, the tortures that the poor girls in her stories suffered!
They were imaginative true; but hardly believable. I mean, for goodness sake,
you would never come across that kind of thing happening in real life. Nothing
like that would ever happen in downtown Spindon for
sure. I mean, for example, such things would never happen to an ordinary girl
like me!

&nbsp;

I was just
finishing the orgy chapter where the heroine is dipped head to toes in
chocolate, so that her two-dozen lesbian lovers can lick her clean. I must
admit that the idea of the Turkish delight in her mouth, the hazelnuts on her
nipples, and the nougat in her she, was an incredible turn-on.

&nbsp;

But
concentration is impossible when one�s mind sees the chocolate coated heroine,
not as the jade haired Japanese schoolgirl of the book, but as the titian tressed, ghost-pale, frolic freckled English schoolgirl,
dressed in white vest and almost non-existent uniformly-school-uniform-grey
miniskirt, sat opposite you.

&nbsp;

And it is
more difficult still to concentrate, when you are just compelled to look for
the evidence you want not to find any of. I was desultorily compulsively eyeing
the stunning gaol-bate honey, when I could not keep
my eyes on my book, which was mostly, to look for any sign that she wore
panties.

&nbsp;

The absence
of the slightest sight told me too how tiny they must be if she did sport any. And
the site would be shaven smooth in honour of her
virginity. That was undoubted. Thornyclit College rules demanded it, I knew. I knew
also that she would be severely caned and thrown out onto the streets naked if
she ever let herself be touched. And I knew true too, that she would be
additionally caned between her legs if she was ever caught touching herself.

&nbsp;

Her hem was
so short that, if she did not wear panties, she must be anointing the seat with
her lick snick, and, for me, the thought of her honeysuckle-sweet virgin aroma
leaving its subtle scent on that seat was causing love�s labias
lust.

&nbsp;

I�m sure
she did it on purpose. The flash. I gasped. It was
reflex. I cough-covered after, and pretended it was something I�d read in my
book that had shocked me.

&nbsp;

Her station
came. She awoke fully. She did not look at me. She was all concentration to
find her school satchel. She did not look at me, and so I now doubted she had
been teasing me after all at all.

&nbsp;

She had
uncrossed her legs, and now kept her knees tight together as she gathered her
glorious hair over her left arm. Then she was on the edge of her seat as she
looked out of the window and parted her legs.

&nbsp;

Oh god, she
looked out of the window and parted her thighs. She showed me her keyhole. She
showed me the gates of heaven. I knew her hymen was hymning guard as she
flicked a flash, and then rose a pure English rose on
her taut tiptop tiptoe standing ballerina shoes, letting her copper curls float
off her arm to the ground, so that after they had swung side-to-side, they hung
intricately swirled, inescapably breathtakingly coiled cape.

&nbsp;

I could not
help but stare at her hair and her wonderful legs. I am only a girl; she the
saint. As she turned to ensure she had left nothing bar her aroma-Arabic on the
seat, physiognomy revealed her light honey eyes alighting nowhere near mine, as
she flicked her eyelashes and then turned to depart.

&nbsp;

I watched
her struggle to get her suitcase from the rear compartment rack. A brunette businessgirl, getting off at the same stop, helped her by
carrying it to the platform for her. Oh god how I wanted to be the carrier of
this sweet miss sweetmeat�s burdens.

&nbsp;

I turned to
the window: �Thank you miss�, I heard the schoolgirl lisp, and watched her bob
leggy curtsy to the totally enraptured businessgirl.

&nbsp;

�Well
really!!� snapped an older woman sat across the carriage corridor, expressing
disgust at my blatant lust. And I turned toward my critic, and I blushed. And
by the time I had turned back to the coach window, the schoolgirl was gone. And
that I concluded would be the last I saw of that devastating Delilah.

�����..

&nbsp;

Oh yes. The interview. I passed the interview. No problems there.

&nbsp;

I got a
steamboat trip to Spain and now, here I was relaxing
off-duty, a servant in the household of Eve and Dawn Midnight.

&nbsp;

I mentioned
the stunning schoolgirl, because I was having girl trouble out here in Spain too.

&nbsp;

I had
expected never to see Angelina Dream again. But she was here at the Midnight�s Spanish villa. Angelina was here,
and so was her redheaded friend, Emma Eyeful.

&nbsp;

Angelina
was taunting me. She was sweet. She was sensitive. She had been deeply hurt by
what she saw me indulging at the Spindon Manor House
bust. Now, somehow, she was Dawn Midnight�s girlfriend.

&nbsp;

I didn�t
know how that had come about. All I knew was the way Angelina clung ivy around
the fantastic negress, Dawn
Midnight. So too did Emma clothe Eve Midnight veneer. But that did not hurt me
as it did to see Angelina ever ready for yet another kiss. And the thought of
Angelina riding slide on Dawn�s fifteen-inch pole, hurt me inside more than it
must have hurt sweet Angelina when she was deflowered by it.

�����..

&nbsp;

�And just
where do you think you are going with her?�

&nbsp;

In charge
of the household staff was the Midnight�s butler Regretta
Grieves. She was no more than twenty, but had the outlook of a woman thrice her
age.

&nbsp;

She wielded
her cane with consummate skill. I�d had one taste of it, and decidedly wanted
no more. For but one millisecond, I�d dared to defy her command for me, the chauffeuse, to take crated bottles of wine down to the
cellar: something I did not consider to be my job.

&nbsp;

For my
cheek, she lashed me in the crease where my right thigh turns into my bum
cheek, and oh god did it bite!

&nbsp;

The Midnight twins had a huge cool cellar
stocked with fine girl-wines, the most precious among which were vintages from
the French wine growing districts in southern England.

&nbsp;

Global
warming had prompted the French to move north to England. The chalk soils of the South Downs now sported and supported the
finest grapes. English girls fed on these grapes and distilled pure rainwater
were a rival for their French and Italian counterparts in the superb wine they
peed.

&nbsp;

Of course,
for the finest wine, the pee had to have been drunk by the girls so that it has
passed through them a minimum of ten times. That was where the French girls
still scored. Their wine-producing ancestry was somehow implanted in their
genes.

&nbsp;

The Midnights even owned ten bottles of a fifty-times single-girl-malt vintage 35. The appellation
contr�le label
confirmed it to be the wine of the legendarily incredibly beautiful French negress Olion
De Crecy, back in the early twentieth-century. Fed on
the finest red grapes and her own resulting pee till it had passed through her
a certified witnessed fifty times, when she was thirty-five years of age. It
had fetched twenty-thousand dollars a bottle at Girlages
Auction House in London.

&nbsp;

Girl-pee of
that quality was rarely consumed. It became an investment. In another ten
years, a 35 Olion De Crecy
would double in value. Ten years on again, and it would have doubled again.

&nbsp;

A lately
identified single bottle of 35 Olion De Crecy double-red 50, produced during one of her monthly
bleeds, was practically priceless. It alone would have sold for several times
the Olion De Crecy red ordinaire.

&nbsp;

�And just
where do you think you are going with her?�

&nbsp;

The crates
I had been ordered to move that day, were of girl-perry:
the cider-wine produce of girls fed solely on pears, pear juice, and their
resultant pee.

&nbsp;

It was for
a dinner-party that evening, and I was to take it out of the crates, and stock
it in a bank of six tall refrigerators, to chill it after its exposure on a
delivery cart, hauled incidentally, by a charming se�orita with her black curls tumbling
tumultuously from under one of the huge straw hats the ponygirls
were given in Spain to shade their lovely complexions from the sun.

&nbsp;

�Not that
fridge, and not the two either side of it either, you stupid girl!� Grieves had
moaned resignedly, while I held two bottles of the perry
looking dumfounded.

&nbsp;

The
refrigerators had all looked the same to me, as I busied with unloading the
bottles. I now assumed, now that I had spotted them that is, that the padlocks
on the three fridges Ms Grieves forbade me to stock, were to protect against
theft of the finer girl-wine.

&nbsp;

However, I
could not see the sense of that since the cellar itself was already always
locked, and only Grieves had a key. But, I assumed some idiot might mix a
precious vintage with a mixed-malt that had no pedigree. A Cecile Dumauriere18
was unlikely to be mistaken for this comparatively cheap girl-cider, but the
cellar was dark, and servants were unreliable readers of ancient labels I supposed.

&nbsp;

�And just
where do you think you are going with her?�

&nbsp;

Grieves was
encyclopaedic on proper etiquette. She had charge
over everything, from the dining table, where she tape-measured even the spaces
between the laid out cutlery for precision, to the hareem,
where she would beat the eunuch-girls savagely, if she found they had been
letting the hareem girls make love among themselves.

&nbsp;

Later that
same day, in the afternoon, I had, since I was near to hand, at Grieves�
command, readied a girl from the hareem for Eve
Midnight�s bed in the coming evening. I assume Eve was planning a threesome
with Emma Eyeful, or had decided on a change of perspective, with the little
tart from the local Volmart that I had by her pretty
hand.

&nbsp;

�And just
where do you think you are going with her?� Grieves had snapped as I led the
pretty creature toward the Midnight�s sleeping quarters.

&nbsp;

The only
places Grieves� rule and rod were not law, were the kitchens, where Mademoiselle
Papillon Etalage, yes
the exquisite French girl, was in charge, and the stables, where the ponygirls were trained and exercised by Jocelyn Trotter, an
English ex private-schoolgirl and a delightfully shapely tomboy. 

�����..

&nbsp;

Regretta
Grieves, the butler, was devastating. She was six-feet tall and of model model�s build. She wore her gold-blonde hair in a high
ponytail that curved up and then back and down from the crown of her head. That
ponytail swished emphasis for her silent �yes� or �no� nods and headshakes as
she eyed command over the table servants working to serve food and wine in the
chandeliered banqueting room.

&nbsp;

Her face
was never visited by a smile, save from the young girls who lusted after her,
and there was no shortage of those.

&nbsp;

Her haughty
demeanour was only enhanced by her black tailcoat,
with its wide lapels, her crisp white shirt, with wing collar and white bowtie,
her tiptoe-top heelless black ballet shoe shod feet, and the fact that her
mystery was only just covered by the black thong she wore over her black nylon
tights.

&nbsp;

To see
Grieves about her duty, must inevitably show the sight of her jacket�s
swallow-tails swinging, with her beautiful bum, bold and bare bar the hug of
her tight tights, a site to behold.

&nbsp;

My chauffeuse uniform was in crisp coarse white, save that the
Midnights loved to see my full-grown woman�s legs in black stockings.

&nbsp;

I too wore
a white bowtie. My bowtie was a bit of a cheat, being preformed rather than
performed as far as the act of tying it was concerned. It formed a choker
around my neck, for I wore nothing on top bar a double-breasted uniform jacket,
double-breasted also by the thrust of my bust, all 38 double-D-cup of which was
uplifted by a cantilever brassiere putting all of my
bosom on display within the V of the lapels of my jacket.

&nbsp;

And you�ll
be pleased to know that I wore black suspenders with my thighs, at the tops of
my stockings at front, fronted, but not affronted, by saucy echoes of my
necktie in the little white �bowties� on my suspender clasps.

&nbsp;

At my back,
my suspenders took a decidedly cheeky route. They stretched over the mountains
of the moons of my monumental rear, pressing on the firm smooth complexion of
my bare bottom.

&nbsp;

You can say
that my stockings, black as crime, were exactly how they seemed, for my seams
followed the flow of the backs of my long legs all the way to my witch-black
suspenders.

&nbsp;

It was
wicked to expect me to drive in en pointe shoes. But
the Midnight twins were wicked. They had hired me for my legs. They
wanted my legs long. I did as I was told. I wore black en pointe
ballet shoes and walked about on constant tiptoe in consequence.

&nbsp;

My blonde
hair tumbled down to the top of my bottom. I wore it long below my airline pilotess� style white chauffeuse
uniform peaked cap.

&nbsp;

Oh, and I
nearly forgot my uniform�s skirt.

&nbsp;

That would
not be difficult to do, there was so little of it. I am a full-grown girl with
a bountiful behind. The skirt was no more than a white wisp whisper of a
creation, just down to just above the crease where the flat back of my thighs
becomes the foothills of my moon mounts.

&nbsp;

It belonged
on the tennis court, and, when the breeze blew, caught me shouting that I was a
girl, without speaking, my lips being tight closed. Indeed, when the breeze
would blow along the crease of my interned love-lips, it would carry my musk on
its zephyrs, because I was forbidden panties.

&nbsp;

�And just
where do you think you are going with her?�

�����..

&nbsp;

The black
vintage limousine I drove as chauffeuse for Eve and
Dawn Midnight, I was also to maintain.

&nbsp;

I have a
mechanical bent, and was bent over very cheekily, doing my daily duty by the
oil and water checks, when I heard Angelina�s incredibly sexy innocent giggle.

&nbsp;

I must
about my duty, and even though I could sense two sets of eyes running the
marathons my legs� lengths outran on their curvy course, I could not look up
from where I was eased over the open bonnet hood, showing everything a shy girl
likes to hide.

&nbsp;

�It�s a
beauty. It�s so smooth and shiny�, Angelina�s sweet voice
opined.

&nbsp;

�Yes. It�s
got huge headlamps with the sweetest bulbs you ever saw too. I love the more
mature models�, Dawn Midnight responded.

&nbsp;

�Is she
powerful?� Angelina innocented.

&nbsp;

�Yes. She�s
naturally aspirated with big pistons. With that broad beam she floats along
with the grace of an ocean liner. She has a muscular structure, but is every
inch very much a she. Those superb lines are so streamlined.�

&nbsp;

�Of course
she needs firm handling. She is a bit wayward unless you keep a strong grip on
her and steer her right. She also needs a good thrashing once in a while to
keep her in tune. She�s a greater runner, superbly smooth in full stride�, Dawn
drawled�.

&nbsp;

��. And so
is the car�, she then suddenly teased. And I heard Angelina hit Dawn with her
gentle fists, followed by a silence I knew was another kiss.

&nbsp;

My
immediate duties done, I rose and turned to face my employer and her
girlfriend. 

&nbsp;

Angelina
completely ignored me. Leaning her long youthful slimness on Dawn, Angelina had
her glistering blonde-downed arms around the negress� waist, and looked lost in love and to love,
as she lingered her head on Dawn�s shoulder her face a daydream, but her mouth
ever ready for the next kiss.

&nbsp;

�You�re
doing a fine job with the auto, Winsome. Well done�, Dawn praised.

&nbsp;

�Thank you
my lady�, I responded, as I dipped a reflex long-leggy strong-leggy curtsy to
my two mistresses, for Angelina, as Dawn�s lover, was now my mistress as much
as Dawn herself.

&nbsp;

�How would
you like a ride in one of Hispano-Suiza�s finest
creations sweetheart?� Dawn whispered to the wrap that embraced her with her
innocent powerful passion.

&nbsp;

�I�d prefer
a kiss�, came Angelina�s soprano solo, so low it was
less than a whisper.

&nbsp;

Dawn moved
to kiss the stunning blonde honeychild again, and
then remembered I was there.

&nbsp;

Dawn at
least recognised that I was there to be seen, even if
Angelina treated me as indivisibly invisible.

&nbsp;

�You can go
Winsome. See Grieves if you would�, Dawn ordered.

&nbsp;

�Yes ma�am�
I obediently responded, dropping another leg shaping deep curtsy.

&nbsp;

As I
slinked away to find the butler, and see what duties she might have for me, I
felt appreciative eyes, Dawn�s at least, on my swinging bottom, and the curves
and swerves of my luscious legs, following the seams of my stockings from my
ankles to where they seemed to promise to lead: the promised land with the
divided dividend.

&nbsp;

Then: �Come
back here please Winsome�, came Dawn�s purr. �We�ve changed our minds. We want
to go for a little spin in the auto after all�.

&nbsp;

�Yes ma�am.
Of course ma�am� I responded, as I walked back toward my mistresses, and then
dipped them the obligatory curtsy, before wiggling to the car to start her.

&nbsp;

�And just
where do you think you are going with her?�

�����..

&nbsp;

I had to
swing start her. I had the starter crank handle to swing in order to turn the
engine over. It hung in its �L� shape out from the bottom of the radiator
grill.

&nbsp;

Eyes never
left my full-grown woman�s handsome legs, as I walked to the driver�s door, put
my cap on the seat, and turned the auto�s ignition on.

&nbsp;

Then too as
I walked, all legs that was not legs, to the front of the auto, where I must
bend over, standing en pointe in my ballet shoes,
straight curvy legs legged, to whip the starter-handle round.

&nbsp;

If I had
been a free girl rather than an employee, I would have politely signalled that for me to bend whilst I was watched would be
embarrassing for me. But I had no right to prompt my audience to move, and I
knew that Dawn Midnight loved to watch my beautiful body just as too, I sensed,
Angelina was enjoying my subservience to her.

&nbsp;

As I bent
over to wind the crank handle to start the vintage limousine, my huge breasts
knew no compromise from gravity as they swung to try and escape my jacket. And
my skirt knew no difference from a stage curtain as it rose on the show of
shows, with my bum bold and beautiful giving a wow as I took a bow at the
beginning rather than at the conclusion of my cabaret display.

&nbsp;

But,
although the horizontal curtain of my hem rose to reveal the players on my
stage, the leading lady remained tight-lipped and protective, keeping her
vertical virtual-curtains closed over the florid pink of the flower within her
bower.

&nbsp;

She was the
magician and the top act on my stage, but she was going to keep the secret of
the rose she secreted. Instead she was performing like a tormenting striptease,
keeping close-closed what the compelled eyes feasted to see if she would
feature, her flash of red. She that was the she of me, was centre-stage and
worthy of the applause her act of secreting her secrets and her secretions
merited, the applause being for the shear magic of her existence, and her entry
on my stage, centre-stage, as a dramatic entry in herself into myself.

&nbsp;

I was blushing the deepest of deep scarlet with embarrassment as I
bent over, thankful for the curtain my gold blonde tresses provided for my
distresses.

&nbsp;

As their
elasticity was tested, I felt my rear suspenders making sexy hallowed hollows
hello below where they caressed and pressed into my impressively bare bottom.
The pulling up of my black stockings on my smooth strong thighs, gave me the
coolness and calm of the balm of the breeze as it kissed my zipped lips� now
exposed. My lips, scented sentinels centre signalling
my indisputable beautiful sex, were siren to sucking,
succubus to searing, lacking licking, but not onlooking
leering, as my mistresses� eyes were transfixed by the sight of the site of the
tight doors of my girl gate.

&nbsp;

On tiptoes
in my balletic shoes, I bent and sent the signals
from my sex, straight strong legged, long legs longingly parted, as I gripped
the handle and whisked the auto into vibrating life.

&nbsp;

Standing
with the crank handle now removed, I curtsied to my two poleaxed
mistresses, and wiggled to the rear door, to open it for Angelina to enter the
limousine, my skirt still high on my bum, and my bum not shy to show its twin
inverse moonrises.

&nbsp;

�Thank you
Winsome�, Dawn whispered, with a tone that strongly signalled
her thanks were for my display that day as such, as much as for my holding open
Angelina�s door, as was my duty anyway.

&nbsp;

I curtsied my still fully-bare-bar-stockings legs, as my
slid-up skirt still insisted it make my bum a flirt. I then wiggled my
half-bare behind, before the divine Dawn, to open her door on the other side of
the auto, before which I curtseyed submissively once again.

&nbsp;

Once Dawn�s door was closed, with yet one more curtsey, I lissomely leggy-legged back to the driver�s door, managing
to pull my naughty hem down over my escaping moonscapes, after I had stowed the
crank handle in the auto�s boot trunk.

&nbsp;

�And just
where do you think you are going with her?�

&nbsp;

I then
opened the driver�s door, donned my chauffeuse�s cap,
and took my seat.

&nbsp;

It stuck up
right up into my she like a round-knobbed penis. I
felt every vibration of the auto�s motor through it. Dawn had watched me
straddle it with my coot-bald pussy with quiet pleasure.

&nbsp;

In the
driver�s seat I was surrounded by mirrors angled, so that those on the rear seats, could enjoy my cleavage and the adage that �longing
is longer when it comes to shapely legs�. For they could see my black-stockinged legs reaching dimple-kneed down to the pedals,
my ample handsome thighs not despised by the leather of the seat also kissing
my bare bum, as my skirt had betrayed me, and thus displayed me disporting my
legs without disappointing.

&nbsp;

Oh, and
that between my legs and up my sin? That was the gearshift.

&nbsp;

The gearstick came up through my seat. I could only just reach
the accelerator, brake or clutch pedals of the auto even with my
tiptoe-stretched feet, without sitting square in my seat. But I could not sit
square in my seat without the gearshift inside my purse, within my sin, such was the tight spot I was in.

&nbsp;

The
wonderful vintage Hispano-Suiza had been modified so
that the gear stick stuck up my she. The length of its
lever, vibrating with the tick-over of the motor, was high and deep within the
divine lips of my lovely love box.

&nbsp;

�And just
where do you think you are going with her?�

&nbsp;

My
predicament was with a stick meant as a vibrator to drive me as I drove and
strove not to have the road to which I came a cause of
my cumming.

&nbsp;

As I looked
down the long bonnet hood of the auto, it seemed the horizon met the silver
figurine of the pretty girl with her skirt supposedly blown up off her
delicious legs by the rush of the forward motion of the car: the mascot on the
radiator top yet to come to this bliss, as we were still stayed in stasis.

&nbsp;

This motif
mascot model, the Midnight twins had had sculpted in mimic of the shear beauty
of my legs. The silver mascot, had my legs, and my
she, and my torpedo tits: a model of the marvel of my streamline breasts,
breasting the wind with her ra ra
skirt up-blown Monrovian.

&nbsp;

As I sat
with the enormous power of the majestic limousine communing with my body
through the gearshift throbbing in the cause of my sighs between my thighs, I
was only too aware of the willing struggle on the back seat, as Angelina had
reached inside Dawn Midnight�s panties, and was now working Dawn�s mighty cock
up to hard rock.

&nbsp;

My mouth
opened as I felt my musk ooze, thinking of the prowess of the Midnight twins
and of the girl that Grieves, the butler, had had me prepare for Eve�s bed this
coming evening, just after Grieves had whipped my right thigh with her cane
that afternoon.

&nbsp;

�And just
where do you think you are going with her?� Grieves had demanded as I had begun
to take that pretty little innocent shop girl to Eve Midnight�s bedroom.

&nbsp;

My pain and
jealousy as I sat awaiting my orders, when I could see from the emotional
motions of her blonde downed arm, that Angelina was fisting Dawn�s cock, were
only increased by the misery of my knowing I had lost Angelina forever, and
that I was virtually a slave.

&nbsp;

�My ladies?� I intoned, politely, querulously, for guidance as to where I was to
drive.

&nbsp;

I could
feel Dawn�s eyes in the mirrors enjoying the shimmying of my heavy breasts
never at rest from the auto�s vibration, my bosom made more huge seeming by the
uplifting from my bra, giving me cavernous cleavage too with my two, as my bare
nipples, excited by my tits� joggling, jousted with the rough material inside
my chauffeuse jacket.

&nbsp;

�Oh. Just
take us for a spin to the other side of town and back here again please
Winsome�, Dawn instructed dismissively.

&nbsp;

�Of course
my lady�, I replied obediently.

&nbsp;

And I
pressed the clutch with my beautiful left leg. And was left no doubt what the
lever up my she was about. As I eased my body and
pushed it fore to first gear, we rolled road. My she
astride the lever inside me, I legged leggy on the pedal once more, and pulled
the lever back toward me, and into second. And I gasped as the lever gapped my she and parted my soft lips. And I long-legged the clutch
pedal yet again, and reached my pretty hand between my legs to ease my pain
from the lever, as I must now wiggle work it fore, side, and then fore again,
to gain third, as if it was a cock I was grinding. I watched Angelina�s head go
down on top of Dawn�s hard knob, her tiny mouth only managing to envelope the
huge head it its hot box. And in reality as well as in the wicked mirrors, my
cantilevered tits, displayed splayed splendid with cleavage, danced tantalising vibrato, with my nipples, ripe strawberries,
rubbed raw on my inner coat, as the lever in my she smote, when I hauled it
into fourth and top with my she. And my she spoke with
moist mouth. I was being masturbated massively by she the auto, as the she who
was my love, licked long a black cock that she longed would spurt sperm. And
the mirrors positioned to display me played both ways. And as I shifted the
limo into top gear and steered her on her course on the coarse roads, I could
see Angelina�s tongue in the septum of the semen seeping crack of Dawn�s, whose
cock she grasped with her dainty little fist, as she played mischievous miss
with her innocent mouth and tongue. And I longed it was Angelina�s mouth on
mine, and Dawn�s cock was up my she, instead of this steadily vibrating gear
shift, giving me all the journey of the automobile; all the journey of arousals
espousal; and none of the arrival of my rival, whose salt pearls Angelina was
now sucking thirstily, to miss none and savour them
oyster on her sweet young tongue, even as for any, but any, relief from my
arousal without arrival I longed. And I once again thought of Grieves the
butler and the girl I had had to ready from the hareem
that very afternoon for Eve Midnight�s bed. And, as I thought of Ms Grieves mistressy over me, and the pretty little girl I was taking
straight to the bedroom, till Ms Grieves had put me right on proper etiquette,
the gearshift vibrating up my she at last made good its threat, and I jerked as
with a millenarian�s kingdom come, with a cum I must not let my mistresses know
I had won, as I replayed voices:

&nbsp;

�And just
where do you think you are going with her?�

&nbsp;

�To Miss Eve�s boudoir ma�am�.

&nbsp;

�You stupid slut Winsome. Strip her naked and lock her in one of the padlocked
refrigerators. She has to sit for six-hours minimum in
a refrigerator. She�s a blonde not a redhead or brunette. Brunettes are served
hot, redheads at room temperature, Miss Eve always has her blondes served
properly chilled�.�

&nbsp;

[to be continued�..]

The Fifth
Blonde

(by Eve Adorer)

&nbsp;

Chapter 3 �
Profound

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

I found
myself, my full-on bosom threatening to overspill my bikini bra, my breasts and
my bottom as brown as my legs, since I had also sunbathed naked, lounging at
the side of a pool in Neliga Spain: the pool of yet another of the Midnight girls� residences.

&nbsp;

I knew it
was overdue that I made contact with MI8 headquarters.

&nbsp;

It had been
as Sonia Berkley-Hunt had said. A group of SGS soldierettes
disguised as workers had repaired a ponygirl corral in
a distant corner of the Midnight twin�s estate. One new fence post
included a solar-charged-battery-powered receiver and microphone. The wire of
the new fence was one long antenna. A geo-stationary satellite would beam my
message to London. All I had to do was to get to the
literal listening post and report or ask as I chose.

&nbsp;

The
particular corral was used for breaking new girls to pony. I knew the Midnights traded ponygirls.
They had some of the finest Irish fillies in their stables. The corral�s
location was chosen for its distance from the stables. The sound of a
fellow-girl screaming with the pain of a whipping when she had put a hoof wrong, could be very disturbing to the high-strung fully-trained
ponygirls in their stalls.

&nbsp;

I had
watched Jocelyn Trotter patiently training a new girl to reins. She had the
poor girl, new to her big toe gripping hooves after all, trot around and around
and around in a circle over and over and over again.

&nbsp;

The girl
was fresh from school and clearly an innocent, shocked and horrified that, for
merely failing her school examinations, she was condemned to be a pony for the
rest of her existence.

&nbsp;

Stripped
completely naked and on open display in public for the first time in her young
life, the poor girl had yet to take in that she had said goodbye to clothes for
eternity.

&nbsp;

Her lovely
little virgin�s titties jumped up and down in unison
as she trotted to get used to the hooves she would now wear forever.

&nbsp;

She was a
copper-tressed freckle-faced schoolgirl, with coils
of cupric gold that rolled mesmerisingly miraculously
shining sun-mirror, from her head to her heels. Her snow-white thighs were red
weal striped where she had been caned for stepping out of line, her rosebud
mouth filled with a bit, her honey eyes filled with tears.

&nbsp;

She was, I
instantly knew, the schoolgirl from the train.

&nbsp;

She was
finding it hard to learn, yet she knew in her heart of hearts she was going to
be trained to reins no matter what it took to break her human spirit and find
the natural pony within her subconscious soul.

&nbsp;

Indeed she
was going to be broken, for English ponygirls were in
high demand. A delicious delight of a virgin like her would fetch a premium at
market. She would probably spend the next twenty years as a decorative
pony-pull for some incredibly lucky rich bitch�s gig.

&nbsp;

Having been
worked all day since crack of dawn, the poor schoolgirl was at a distance to me
now, in yet another corral, being dragged around at a trot on an automated
pony-trainer rotator. It had her lovely legs working as it dragged her by the
rein from the bit in her mouth around and around on her fresh-fitted hooves.
And as I passed I saw the evidence for the particular distress of this poor schoolgirl
steed, in the red on the insides of her thighs indeed, for she, poor she,
completely naked in public for the first time in her very young life, was
oozing her shaming monthly bleed.

&nbsp;

I knew I
too was due on. I knew I too was due on, and it was as if the sight of this
delectable Delilah suffering her pony-training, naked as nature, and bleeding
her girl-confirmatory scarlet in open public shame, had drawn me on in sympathy
and empathy.

&nbsp;

But I was a
week away that day and I was thus in randy week, when I was hot not from the
ferment of my period, but from the high hormone fire that was this stage of my
feminine cycle.

�����..

&nbsp;

Wiggling
out to the fence post I knew had the microphone in it, I was hardly dressed as
an MI8 operative, in just my blue bikini and my balletic
shoes.

&nbsp;

To skirt
the endlessly trotting naked schoolgirl, and hide my intentions from any prying
eyes in the distant house, I decided to go through a field used for grazing
cows.

&nbsp;

Let me the
first to admit that cows terrify me. There is just something about their big
eyes and their lumbering stupid relaxedness that makes me want to turn my
pretty bum and run.

&nbsp;

The timing
of my mission to send a signal to London could not have been worse where
that day was concerned. I had opened the gate where the Midnight�s prize dairy cattle grazed, and
turned to close it, before I turned again, to see the whole heard of cows
slowly lumbering toward me.

&nbsp;

The timing
of my mission to send a signal to London could not have been worse. The herd were heading to gather at the gate I was at, in
readiness to be let from the field to the nearby barn for their evening
milking.

&nbsp;

As the cows
drew ever closer, I struggled and fought with the bolt on the gate, making the
simple act of opening it to exit, the impossible challenge for even Hercules,
had she been on hand.

&nbsp;

Then
something touched me, and I squeaked with pent-up fright,
and my body goose-pimpled passingly.

&nbsp;

As I dared
to turn my head toward the touch I was staring into the big brown eyes and long
lashes of a languorous cow, still chewing on some grass she had some strands of
protruding from her mouth.

&nbsp;

�Hi
beautiful�, she mumbled.

&nbsp;

I looked at
this sun-blessed brown tanned ruminating cud chewer and her huge breasts like
massive raindrops hanging from her chest to below her hips.

&nbsp;

The fine
filigree of sensitive veins centring on her nipples were of supreme delicacy. The nipples dammed to stop her
milk seeping, she must surely have been in pain from
her gallon-sized mammaries. And yet, in some way, she
had become her tits. She was no more than a beautiful carrier of those
enormously expanded breasts that swung pendulum with her every cloven-bootie
shod step.

&nbsp;

How old was
she? Maybe twenty. She too must have failed her school
examinations. But her fate had been different to that of the delightful
Delilah, the choice of this girl�s post school future being set down by the
original natural size of her chest.

&nbsp;

Made to
strip naked and stand in line side-by-side with the other school failures, she
would have trembled with fear as the headmistress and her deputy went along the
line and she heard: �Pony�, �Pony�, �Pony�, �Carthorse�, �Pony�, �Bitch�,
�Cow�, �Pony�, �Carthorse�, �Bitch�, �Bitch�, and learned thus the harsh lesson
that her tits, the tits of which she had been so proud, would soon be injected
with hormones to bring her to milk.

&nbsp;

To make her
breasts expand, for months on end they would only have milked her on alternate
days, so that her dammed breasts were damned agony to her, and her nipples
hugely sore. And this would continue until she could produce two gallons of
milk per day, a gallon from each tit.

&nbsp;

�Hi
beautiful� she said.

&nbsp;

�Oh. Hello�
I answered as, at long last, I was able to open the gate as well as my mouth,
and escape.

&nbsp;

I felt so
sorry for the poor dairy-girl, but I just could not relate to her as still a
fellow human being.

&nbsp;

As I turned
to look at her again, I saw tears in her eyes, and I knew I had caused her
pain.

&nbsp;

�Sorry!� I
called softly, and then turned to find I was facing the butler, Grieves, with
her cane readied for my backside.

&nbsp;

�Get back
to the house Winsome. Miss Eve and Miss Dawn want to talk to the servants.
There is a spy in the household, and we are going to expose her for the traitor
she is!� Grieves gloated. 

�����..

&nbsp;

My fear
that I was the suspect: that they had discovered I was undercover for MI8, played darkly within my mind. Yet, somehow, the
prospect I had been discovered and would be uncovered, quite literally if the Midnights decided to take revenge on my body,
made me reckless.

&nbsp;

I am a girl
who needs sex. I constantly crave another girl adoring and exploring me. The
reckless mood was therefore prompted, or at least promoted, by my randy state.
I was horny for a honey. Papillon Etalage filled my daydream hours.

&nbsp;

There is
just that something the French girls give to the English language that no other
nationality, unless also natively French speaking, can gift.

&nbsp;

English is
so cold and cool and calm, till a French girl accents it with the scented
boudoir. A French girl speaking English says �bed�, and not for the purposes of
sleeping. In her intonation, a language of cold calculation becomes the
alluring lingua franca of love. A French girl speaking English is sex.

&nbsp;

Whenever
the household was to assemble, it was not as instantaneously as Grieves had
implied when she had diverted me from among the dairy-girls back to the house.

&nbsp;

As she had
caught me out and about I could hardly continue my mission to make first
contact with London. I would have to find another
chance, or hope London would somehow make contact with me.

&nbsp;

It was not
that I had anything to report. I had no knowledge of the Midnight twins� plans, or even if they had
any, in the criminal line. I just wanted some contact with the outside world,
as relief from the pressure of my secret mission.

&nbsp;

Again, it
was not that I had anything to report. There was nothing about the life the Midnights were leading in Spain that was in breach of local or
international law or, therefore, that would be illegal in England.

&nbsp;

The ruling
in the �Bengal-Beauty� case at the International Court at The Hague, where that
stunningly gorgeous Asian-Indian girl, conducting her own case with ease
elegance and eloquence, pleading that her employers had no right to make her
into a ponygirl, had removed the last vestige of
doubt.

&nbsp;

The three
female justices had declared that, in international law as it now stood, employers were one and the same as owners. By
accepting employment, a girl therefore transferred the rights over her mind and
body to her employer. She thus became property. As property she could not plead
successfully in court. Courts only dealt with human affairs. By definition
property is not human.

&nbsp;

Furthermore,
the question whether a girl remained property when her employment ceased with a
given employer, or whether the ending of her employment returned her to human
rights, was not the thorny question �Bengal-Beauty� (previously known as the
high-flying lawyer Ms Padinda Panita)
had tried to argue before the court. As property, a girl could be sold or
transferred to the ownership of another employer: period. The question of the
girl giving consent did not arise. There was no case in law for an owner to
seek the consent of her property, for anything, at any time.

&nbsp;

The Midnights had all the appurtenances of the
wealthy. A full stable of ponygirls, a herd of prize
dairy-girls, homes in England, Spain, and the USA, and the vintage automobile for
which I was their chauffeuse. All of these were reputedly
ill-gotten gains, but nobody had ever proved it.

&nbsp;

To all
appearances so far in my undercover mission, the Midnights were content with what they had,
and had no plans to go for more. The farm was for fun. Their investments were
their real assets, and those were making a million dollars a day. 

�����..

&nbsp;

I changed
from my bikini into a black bolero top and flame flamenco skirt. I decided to
wear one of my chauffeuse�s uniform uplift bras, no
panties of course, and slinked to the kitchens to try and attract the attention
of the adorable Papillon.

&nbsp;

I lingered
over some melons ready waiting for some dish to be prepared from them. I was
happy to show off my own melons, and leant purposely forward, trying to catch Papillon�s startling blue eyes, by taking a gentle interest
in the feel of the two melon fruits, as an unsubtle message that my fruits were
free to be felt if she wished to caress them.

&nbsp;

Papillon
blushed when she saw me. And I knew instantly that my mission had failed before
it had really begun. It took only a few moments more to show that, lovely
though she was toward me, I was getting in the way of Papillon
directing the preparation of the Midnight�s evening meal. 

�����..

&nbsp;

Disappointed
but still ravenously randy, I decided to take the air once more.

&nbsp;

There was
still no sign of the gathering. I had recovered my confidence too, on the
question of whether I had been discovered. Nobody had troubled me in the least.
Surely, if I were a suspect, Grieves would have been despatched
to round me up and keep me till the Midnights could be bothered to deal with me.

&nbsp;

The sun was
in a cloudless sky. I decided on a walk.

&nbsp;

In the
distance, I could see the dust rising from the hay harvesting.

&nbsp;

If nothing
else, to go and watch what was going on over in that distance was something to
do for the rest of my free day.

&nbsp;

The
alternative was to try and make it to the signalling
post once again. But with the revelation of an alleged spy in the offing, I
considered it foolish in the extreme to show I was one. That was still assuming
of course, that I had not been found out anyway. If the latter were the case of
course, to get myself caught trying to contact London would be the ultimate shit on the
cake.

&nbsp;

Still in my
black bolero jacket and flame red and yellow flamenco, I added a silly straw
sombrero to shade my balconied bosom from the searing sun.

&nbsp;

Walking
wonder-wander-ass-wave as my construction dictates, I tiptoed in my balletic shoes drawing ever closer to the idyllic bucolic
scene. And as I did so, I found the shear relaxing beauty of what I witnessed,
cooled and calmed my desire-fires.

&nbsp;

From the
nearer distance I had now wiggled to, I could clearly see the harvesting
machine, with its rotating scythe blades, slicing the grass,
that was already hay hue, off at near base.

&nbsp;

The patient
ponygirl in bit and reins seemed the personification
of relaxation, as she plodded, her feet on tiptoe in the heavy iron hoofs on
each big toe. Her legs were supremely dreamily strong and extremely shapely
too, as she planted each footfall a measured distance and time between, walking
on the stubble her previous passage had produced.

&nbsp;

A pretty
teenage schoolgirl, walking behind, held the reins of the ponygirl.
The schoolgirl, perhaps helping out on the farm for money to buy a present for
her girlfriend, had little work to do, as the ponygirl
clearly loved her task.

&nbsp;

A steel bit
ran east-west across the ponygirl�s mouth. From the
reaper, with its blades rotating at the sides, a taut chain ran to another cold
steel bit, that ran north-south. That was the she-bit.
The ponygirl patiently pulled the reaper by her she,
a labyrinth of intricate straps holding the bit up into her intimacy.

&nbsp;

She-bits
were in common use. They calmed a ponygirl, keeping
her mind on her task, instead of letting her dream of romance and sex, as most ponygirls were reckoned to do when they were not being
worked hard enough.

&nbsp;

At the end
of the row just reaped, the ponygirl was turned to
walk back the other way, so the blades on the other side of the reaper took
their turn at scything.

&nbsp;

The teenage
schoolgirl had fashioned a switch from a stick to beat the older girl in
harness, and gently tapped the bewitching bottom of the gorgeous pony, because
it was such an irresistibly wonderful target. She was not hurting the ponygirl. But the tapping on the ponygirls
bum reminded the pony how lovely she was, and encouraged her in her steady
plod.

&nbsp;

Having now
reached the edge of the field where the hay was being reaped, I listened to the
peaceful tinkling of the tease-bells dangling from the ponygirl�s
nipples, and watched her ample breasts beat time with her gracious steps, as
she walked with the �clump�, �clump� of her heavy hoofs toward me.

&nbsp;

Her dark
Asian-Indian complexion was flawless. Her deep-brown eyes, though showing she
was relaxed and resigned to her fate, somehow conveyed high intelligence.

&nbsp;

A sudden
shock ran down my spine: the shock of realisation and
recognition. This incredible beauty was the London lawyer I had been reading about
during my enforced stay in hospital.

&nbsp;

It was
surely she. I strained to read the name on her headband, and the sight of me
looking intently at her, seemed to remind the ponygirl
of another life, and to excite her.

&nbsp;

I heard the
whistle of the schoolgirl�s switch, and the �whack� of its impact on the Indian
girl�s potent posterior, and I felt the pain for her, as she regained her
reminded submission to her ponygirl lowliness, and I
moved away to leave �Bengal-Beauty� to her slow slaving.

�����..

&nbsp;

She was
stripped naked; the negress
wore a white g-string. The willowy blonde with the hair down to her buttocks,
swung the hay up to the shapely negress
who worked atop the haystack they were building.

&nbsp;

The blonde
was music to my eyes. She was tall, slim, and extremely feminine in face and
limb, with tiny titties. Her chest was almost boyish;
but nobody could possible mistake her for other than a girl.

&nbsp;

Her hair
was more straw in colour than the straw she was
stacking. Indeed she had breeze-blown straws caught up in it. Her eyes were
laser blue. Her face, was youthfully full of disarming
charm, with an alarmingly inviting ripe-raspberry lipped mouth. Was she twenty?

&nbsp;

She was
busy as was her companion, and did not notice my approach. Her bare body, brown
as proverb, she swung her straw loaded fork lissomely
with long slim arms to go with her long strong legs.

&nbsp;

In her
tiptoe ballerina shoes, her legs went from zero to eternity, or at least from
earth to the moons that glowed globe as her delightful
side-dimpled derriere.

&nbsp;

And then I
saw it, and audibly gasped with astonished joy. For this creation�s pubic hair,
blonde and as sun-kissed as her tousle-tumbled corn gold head, dangled down,
all the way down, to her pretty ankles. Her she was in there somewhere, hidden
within the jungle of spun-gold-spirals that was this adorable honey�s pubic
curls.

&nbsp;

�Careful
with your pitchfork Aneedlina!� the Jamaican lilt of
the charming negress called from the stop of the
stack as I drew near, and the sweet honeychild with
the amazing pubic twirls stopped her work, turned to me, and curtseyed.

&nbsp;

�Good
afternoon my lady� the blue-eyed angel whispered. �We are making progress as
you can see, it was very good of you to loan mummy
�Bengal-Beauty�. My little sister over there is doing the reaping. She loves ponygirls. She wants to be one herself when she�s graduated
from college. Moonanza and I are stacking the hay so
that mummy�s dairy-girls will have winter food�.�.

&nbsp;

And then it
dawned on her, the look on my face telling her: �Oh. I�m so sorry. I thought
you must be one of the Moonlight twins. I�m so sorry. You see I haven�t met
them, but they have been so kind to mummy with lending her a ponygirl for harvest and ploughing�.
I�m so sorry. I�ve just come over from Oxton University in England to help mummy out with the hay
harvest�..�

&nbsp;

Her voice
trailed off as she followed my eyes.

&nbsp;

�I�ll put
my panties on if you find it repulsive�..�

&nbsp;

�No.. No Aneedlina��? Aneedlina�.?� I began my response and turned into a query,
just dying to know this incredible girl by her full name.

&nbsp;

�Oh yes: of
course. Over there, with �Bengal-Beauty� is my, our, kid-sister Minoka, she�s just about to go to college. Up there is the
middle of the three of us, our, half-sister, adopted
really, Moonanza, and I�m the oldest: Aneedlina. We�re the Rickfound sisters ma�am. I�m Aneedlina Rickfound ma�am. � shall I put my
panties on?�

&nbsp;

�No.. No Aneedlina. Please no. Your
love-hair is the most beautiful sight�.�

&nbsp;

Aneedlina
blushed profusely, and I caught the eye of Moonanza
who was clearly on the verge of teasing her beautiful sister, but for my
presence.

&nbsp;

Reluctantly,
I turned to go back to the Moonlight�s farm. I had not realised
till now that I had gone beyond its bounds. In fact I had not. The Rickfound family were tenants of
the Moonlight twins. They farmed land they did not own.

&nbsp;

As I walked
away, I heard Moonanza call down to her sister in
gentle taunt: �Who�s a pretty girl then?!�

&nbsp;

�She was
very nice�, came Aneedlina�s
still embarrassed reply, as Moonanza giggled her
sisterly love for the willow-wand wonder with the spun-gold head-spinningly-erotic ankle-length-long pubic coiffure...

�����..

&nbsp;

�Where in hell have you been Winsome?!� Grieves demanded
as I reappeared at the Midnight�s house.

&nbsp;

�I told you
there was a household staff assembly. Nobody gave you permission to wonder off
again�, she intoned quietly threateningly.

&nbsp;

�Get
changed into something respectable, and then into the banqueting hall. And
don�t take more than half-an-hour about it�, she concluded, with an inference
that I would have tasted her cane, if she were not busy elsewhere. 

�����..

&nbsp;

Looking in
the mirror after a swift shower, I realised I needed
a shave. My she had a sex o� clock shadow. The fine
blonde stubble felt softer to my touch than its appearance would suggest it
should.

&nbsp;

That touch
was a mistake. I gasped. A flash vision of the incredible pubic hair of the
wonderful willow Aneedlina Rickfound
made me cream instantly.

&nbsp;

I took my
hand away and went down on my shapely haunches, the fire of desire burning
through the hole that leads to my very soul. If ever a girl needed, but needed,
her vibrator, I was then she, as my she cried banshee.

&nbsp;

I rubbed my
enormously shapely huge thighs together, and then hugged my thighs against my
tits with my arms, and rocked on the toes of my bare feet, fighting to get
control over my second mind, the mind mid my thighs: my minx.

&nbsp;

Rising
slowly, thinking I had regained control, I stood, and then grasped a doorframe
as a pain in my tummy doubled me over. My she was
telling me she needed me. She that was me was ordering me to give her
attention.

&nbsp;

I stayed
bare-legged. I donned a cool cotton micro-micro-skirt and matching
short-sleeved shirt, both in white. Another passage of pain passed mildly as I
strapped on my ballet-shoes, and wrapping their long ribbon-laces criss-cross around my lower legs, tying them off with bows
just below my knees.

&nbsp;

Rising to
tiptoe, I looked myself over in my full-length mirror. My braless breasts were
fancy free as they danced in my blouse when I slinked to the mirror. My legs
seemed never to have looked longer nor more
full-grown-woman in their powerful beauty. I tousled my blonde locks. I had no
time for brush or comb.

&nbsp;

I turned
and looked at my reflection over my shoulder, pleased to see that my bum looked
big in my micro-micro-skirt, as I smoothed my hands over it to stop the hem
rising such that it showed sickle-moons.

&nbsp;

I was
ready. 

�����..

&nbsp;

I was
ready, but I was not ready.

&nbsp;

I was ready
dressed to take my place in the front row on one of the banqueting room chairs.
The table, huge and hugely heavy oak though it was, had been moved aside, and
we servants sat, in chairs arranged in a curve, as theatregoers
might, so we could see centre of the floor.

&nbsp;

I was not
ready for the device that was placed where the table had been.

&nbsp;

Okay, so it
was only an anvil. The anvil was raised on a wooden plinth. But, what was an
anvil doing in the banqueting hall? The Midnight girls used a visiting blacksmith to
shoe their ponygirls, so the anvil was used only once
or twice per week. But, what was an anvil doing in the banqueting hall, why was
it not in the blacksmith�s forge?

&nbsp;

I put my
pretty hands on my bare thighs as I heard the sound of Papillon�s
supremely sexy voice.

&nbsp;

I had
turned around to try and see who was missing from among our number, when I
heard: �Non! Non! Non!!� and
witnessed the exquisite Papillon Etalage, naked as the day Paris first saw her, crawling with
two bitch-collars around her neck, pulled by two leashes, one each being held
by Eve and Dawn Midnight.

&nbsp;

The poor
girl had had her hair twirled into two pigtail plaits, and these were roped to
her big toes, so that her lovely head was pulled hard back, and her fabulous
legs were folded tight in a shape profoundly soundly only found with girl: a
shape that redefined the curve.

&nbsp;

Her bright
blue eyes were unnaturally wide-open with the pull on her hair. Every step she
took she took like a bitch. Bitch-tied girls were commonplace pets even in the
poorest households. Their legs were tied ankles at top of thighs so they had to
crawl just like poor Papillon, but their hair was not
used in this savage way.

&nbsp;

�Mon dieu! �Av mercy on me! I no spy!! Mon dieu! Non! Non! Non!!� she called as she crawled with her knees as her
rear �paws� being exhibited to us as an example of what would befall those
caught even only allegedly spying on the Midnight twins.

&nbsp;

I was not
ready for this. Nor was I ready for the reaction of my she
to the sight of the stunning French girl.

&nbsp;

My eyes
feasted and my she fed from her body. Her hourglass
shape was unmistakably fully-formed in form female.

&nbsp;

I knew for
an absolute fact, that her lovely hair was genuinely fine blonde. And yet the
hair of her she was the most exquisite titian auburn. Her head was blonde but
her pubic hair was red instead, and with no reason to conclude that this was
not the entirely natural state of things with this stunning wonder.

&nbsp;

I looked
too and feasted on the site of Papillon�s adorable
slim arms. She was double-jointed at her elbows, and her lovely arms bowed
inwards incredibly erotically as she crawled seeming all the more girl for her
arms being so femininely formed.

&nbsp;

Her huge
firm tits swung belle bells to knell her road to hell as the sweet French doll
crawled before an audience appalled by her being pulled along like an animal.

&nbsp;

Yet my she was moist. Looking at Papillon�s
blonde hair and redhead�s minge, her incredibly
shapely legs, her beautiful bowed arms, her swinging breasts tolling totally
silently beau-bell, my she distinctly dampened, and I
longed to cross my legs and squeeze my lemon.

&nbsp;

The
midnights led poor Papillon to the anvil, and there
they made her rise so she was �stood� on her knees, her head hauled back by the
pull on her corn-gold plaits and with her hugely handsome bosom resting
platform on the unyielding cold of the evil anvil.

&nbsp;

Grieves,
the butler seemed only too eager to girlacle Papillon�s dainty wrists behind her and take one of the
leashes, whilst Jocelyn Trotter took the other, to hold Papillon
in place.

&nbsp;

�Mon dieu! �Av mercy on me! I no spy!! I no spy!!� Papillon, incapable of
escape, sexied the air with her inescapably
potent-potion pronunciation of her Parisian�s broken English.

&nbsp;

The Midnight twins stood either side of the
anvil, each wielding a whippy Sarawak cane.

&nbsp;

Then Eve
Midnight walked behind Papillon and used her cane to
gently tap Papillon�s she on its lips.

&nbsp;

From where
I sat, I could only be sure that that was what she was doing from the clear
reaction of Papillon�s nipples.

&nbsp;

Non!! Non!! Non!!!� Papillon
gasped in rising seductive intonation, inducting further as Eve used the cane
to slide slowly back and forth between the lips of Papillon�s
red haired she.

&nbsp;

Papillon�s
nipples danced the devil�s jig as Dawn�s cane was slid along between the lips
of her slice.

&nbsp;

Eve played Papillon�s violin with the cane as bow till Papillon�s nipples had betrayed her by displaying their
full flower, and the music from Papillon�s mouth was
the sighs of fiercest fire�s desire.

&nbsp;

Such were
her crisis cries, still boudoir embellished by her cute, acutely sexy, Parisian
accent. Papillon was now emitting and transmitting
the international language of love, in moans of a tone intimating that she was
virtually ripe for a cum.

&nbsp;

Content
that the orchestra on which she was about to play percussion, was fully tuned
to Fuck-major, Eve lifted her cane, gifted with Papillon�s
intimate scent, and sniffed the parfum-Arabic Papillon�s seeping
willow had wept on the wicked weapon.

&nbsp;

Grieves and
Jocelyn Trotter now took tight grip of the leashes to hold Papillon�s
chest at rest on the cold of the old anvil altar, and the Midnight girls whipped her tits without let
or mercy.

&nbsp;

It was
sudden; swift; savage; and followed by silence.

&nbsp;

Two stokes
across the middle of one breast each stroke spoke. A left and
a right in separate duet. The swift strokes compressed the soft flesh of
the breasts, opening the nipples like roses. But the silence was eerie. The
silence came from the pain of the cane. The whistle of their wipes through the
air, followed by the �wap�; �wap�
of the slaps on the bare tits, was followed by silence from the violence, till
the pain, from strokes initially anaesthetising,
fully told, full toll, and Papillon screams unfolded
and rolled raw roar.

&nbsp;

From after
the first two strokes and the pause for the pain to gain, the canes now
whistled wickedly down on the proud flesh of Papillon�s
bare breasts in alternation, with such rapidity of viciousness that Papillon could not scream as she wanted and was wonted by
each wanton whip, but screamed unintelligible terribly in one long cry of
agony�s agony as her tits were slapped hard down onto the unyielding bitter
cold of the anvil and each cane stroke bit her flawless breast flesh afresh
into vivid stripes of livid living pain.

&nbsp;

Papillon
was lashed long and hard and harder by the infuriated Midnight girls whose
cocks popped out of their panties, as their fifteen-inch love-meat burst
proud-giant out to meet match with the stiffness of the canes with which they
whipped Papillon�s paps.

&nbsp;

And Papillon�s cries of miserable horror from the hellfire of
the stripes from the Midnight�s ire,
were turning to tune tentative and then full-on sexual moans of the most
lustful wanton wicked burning desire, as her fires caught higher and her she
dripped her love lust lick-cream down her inner thighs till it pooled on the
ground.

&nbsp;

Then, in a
moment of silence was heard the shameful shaming hiss, as Papillon pissed herself with her fear. And
the canes whipped down on her poor striped tits twice more. And, so suddenly
and shockingly ecstatically unexpectedly, she came with a scream of the joy of
absolute joy in her pain of pain of pain.

&nbsp;

And then a
look of shock and horror flashed across Papillon�s
gorgeous face. A look of total incomprehension at the tension she felt in her
brutally whipped tits as the whipping was paused. For a flow was filling and
fulfilling a function at a conjunction from the whipping�s unction. The
whipping had cracked Papillon�s already high oestrogen octane to a gain of even higher refinement, and
was having its fulfilment in that which was filling Papillon with white-hot fuel.

&nbsp;

And the
canes whistled down the while, and Papillon came
multiply upon multiply complexly with her milk suddenly sputtering, teetering,
trickling, and then spitting from her nipples even as her girl-wine pissed from
her she and her honey pooled around her knees.

&nbsp;

And they
whipped her tits twice more, and the proof that Papillon�s
heavenly body had been wholly hormonally transmogrified by her unholy flogging,
shot two merging white streams from her nipples straight up my
micro-micro-skirt onto me and into me, into my she, as she came again and I
came too with her fresh hot tit milk as demon�s semen in my cunt,
looking at her thrashed breasts at long last at rest, with her milk pouring
under where they rested on her chest, forming tributaries of a single white
river that gathered in her naked navel, before it rolled down to her betraying
she and into her parted love-lips as if, if it could not flow to the sea, it
would be would-be semen too for she as well as for me, before it dripped to
ground to join her piss and her love-honey. ��.And then she fainted. 

�����..

&nbsp;

In their
khaki-coloured sweatshirts micro-miniskirts and
panties, with olive-green stockings and suspenders, soldierettes
of the Special Girl Service suddenly burst through the door.

&nbsp;

Emma Eyeful
and Angelina Dream, metaphorically and physically MI8 �sleepers�, assisted in
the capture of Eve and Dawn Midnight.

&nbsp;

Papillon Etalage, revealed as French Surette, was untied and wrapped in a wrap
akin to a kimono.

&nbsp;

�We can�t
get you in the �copter for this trip Truly!� Angelina
called, as the hit team dragged the Midnights out for the mid-Atlantic dump
planned for them, albeit that it would now be the mid-Mediterranean. 

&nbsp;

�We can�t
get you in the �copter for this trip Truly, but
there�s a follow-up backup, and a couple of the SGS will take care of you
meanwhile my love!� sweet Angelina sincered.

&nbsp;

But then
the hand of Regretta Grieves silently slipped into
mine, and I knew that, if only we could sneak away, I would not be there when
the next helicopter arrived�.

&nbsp;

The End
