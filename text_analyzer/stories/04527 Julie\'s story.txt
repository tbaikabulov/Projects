ONE

&nbsp;

�I have to get to Tonga
today!� Can�t you help me?�

&nbsp;

My name is Julie Hudson.�
I am a freelance photographer and I�ve been hired to do a photo shoot on
the small island of Tonga.� If I don�t get there today, the job will go
to someone else.� To say that I am
desperate is an understatement.

&nbsp;

The person I am talking to is Jim Carmichael, the pilot of
the local air service here in Brisbane.� He is a tall, handsome man, about thirty,
with sparkling gray eyes and a mouth that is in a perpetual smile.� If I had more time, I would have liked to get
to know him more intimately but I don�t.�
I repeat my question.

&nbsp;

�Please, Jim, I really need to get there!�

&nbsp;

�I don�t know, Julie.�
There�s a pretty bad storm brewing just South
of here.� Can�t you wait until it passes?�

&nbsp;

�No, I must be there by this evening!� I�ll pay you double if you�ll take me now!�

&nbsp;

�OK, but it�s against my better judgement.� Get your gear and let�s board.�

&nbsp;

The twin engine Cessna took off easily and in moments we
were over blue water.� I gazed down at
the expanse of nothing as Jim gained altitude and then I settled back and
closed my eyes, hoping to take a little nap.

&nbsp;

I was awakened by the violent shaking of the aircraft and
found Jim fighting to maintain control of the plane.� All around us were dark clouds and rain was
pelting the windshield.

&nbsp;

�What is this?� I asked.

&nbsp;

�That storm I warned you about.� I�m trying to find an altitude we can get to
without using oxygen.� Didn�t
think to add any canisters so we�re stuck to something under 10,000 feet.� Even that�s risky!�

&nbsp;

My stomach was doing a real number now as the plane dropped
what seem a thousand feet and suddenly rose up again.� I clasped my arms across my chest and hugged
myself to keep from shaking.

&nbsp;

The engine on the right side suddenly sputtered and
coughed.� Jim looked over with troubled
eyes while trying to restart the idle motor.

&nbsp;

�Uh Oh!� We got real problems!�

�

The plane began to descend at a rapid rate and I strained to
see something outside but everything was getting darker and darker.

&nbsp;

�Where are we?�

&nbsp;

�Not sure,� he replied, �but somewhere between Brisbane
and Tonga.� This wind has blown us way off course and my
radio doesn�t pick up any signals.� Got
to find something we can land on before too long, though.�

&nbsp;

As we descended, I could see the sweat break out on Jim�s
forehead as he fought the controls.� The
storm increased in ferocity and the plane was buffeted about like a dandelion
in the wind.� I began to shiver and I
wished I had worn more than a T-shirt and khaki shorts.� Suddenly the clouds parted a bit and I could
see a small island beneath us.

&nbsp;

�Jim!� There�s
land!� We�re over an island!�

&nbsp;

�Yeah, I see it.� Now
if I can just ease her down on that beach!�

&nbsp;

The waves were crashing on to the shore and I wondered how
Jim was ever going to land in this horrific wind.� We were still bouncing around like a yo-yo
and we couldn�t have been over 100 feet above the water.

&nbsp;

�Hang on!� Jim shouted, seconds
before the plane struck the water.� I
flew forward and banged my head on the instrument panel, causing me to black
out.� I was dimly aware of being in the
water and being pulled from the plane.�
After that, I couldn�t remember anything.

&nbsp;

I came to, laying face down on the beach with waves gently
breaking over my legs.� I felt a warmth on my back and slowly realized that it had quit
raining.� I raised myself up on my elbows
and looked around.� As far as I could see
in either direction, the beach ran with a jungle beginning some fifty yards
back from the water.� Jim was nowhere to
be seen.

&nbsp;

I sat up and surveyed myself to see what, if anything, was out of place.�
Aside from a torn T-shirt, I appeared to be uninjured.� Shakily, I stood up and brushed the sand from
my face.

&nbsp;

�Hey!�

&nbsp;

I was startled at the sound of the voice and turned to see Jim
emerging from the jungle.� He was
carrying a bag in one hand and a big knife in the other.

&nbsp;

�Good to see you�re up and about.� Feel OK?�

&nbsp;

�Yea, I think so.�
What have you got?�

&nbsp;

�I was able to grab a few supplies from the plane before it
sank.� I missed the beach about a hundred
yards before that wave grabbed us.� A
couple of trips back, after I got you ashore, was all
the time I had.� I�ve been looking
around.� Looks like
we�re the only ones on this place, as far as I could see.� The good news is there is plenty of fruit
around and I found a small fresh water stream about a quarter of a mile into
the jungle.� Hungry?�

&nbsp;

�Starved!� So, what are our chances of getting rescued?�

&nbsp;

Jim handed me a couple of bananas from the bag while he
proceeded to carve up a mango.� 

&nbsp;

�Well, I�m not sure where in the hell we are.� If we�re in the shipping lanes, we should be
able to attract attention with a bonfire.�
Maybe they�ll send out search planes looking for us when we don�t arrive
in Tonga.� Until then, we�ll just have to make the best
of it.�

&nbsp;

Jim had salvaged a parachute from the plane and we used that
to erect a shelter just inside the jungle.�
Wet, afraid and hungry, I spent my first night.

&nbsp;

As the days passed, I began to give up all hope that we
would be found.� There was no sign of any
passing ships or planes overhead.� I must
confess that I was not uncomfortable living on the island.� Jim was a good provider of food and water and
the shelter he had constructed protected us from the monsoon rains that came
every evening.� He had not attempted any
passes toward me which left me a bit confused but I enjoyed his company.

&nbsp;

As time passed, our clothing became more and more
disreputable.� With the combination of
sun and rain, my T-shirt was little more than a few shreds of cloth.� Likewise, my shorts had torn in the most
revealing places and did little to cover my ass.� Jim had long since tossed his shirt and was
down to his trousers that he had removed the legs from.� His muscular body was on display and I
couldn�t help but stare at him constantly.�
I thought of taking a piece of the parachute to make a sarong out of but
it was rapidly deteriorating as well.

&nbsp;

After we had been marooned for more than a month, I was down
to my thong panties and a T-shirt that barely covered my tits.� When it would rain, I may as well have been
completely naked.� Jim pretended not to
notice my nudity but I could tell from the lump in his trousers that he was
well aware of it.� Finally, one night I
was awakened when Jim�s hand began to massage my breasts.� Half awake, I moaned as the pleasant
sensations filled my brain.� When his
hand touched my stomach and began to stroke it gently, I whimpered and searched
for his lips with my own.� His tongue
explored the inner recesses of my mouth as we clasped each other tightly.

&nbsp;

I felt his fingers grasped the top of my panties and I
raised my hips as he pulled them down my legs.�
I opened my thighs and gasped when I felt his stiff erection poised at
the entrance to my pussy.

&nbsp;

�Yes!� Yes!� I moaned,
lifting my body to meet his.� With one
thrust, he buried his cock in my sopping wet cunt, sending me into a frenzy of
ecstasy.� Slowly he moved in and out of
me while his lips caressed my nipples.� I
was overcome with lust and wrapped my legs around his body, grunting with each
thrust of his cock.� The two of us came
simultaneously with my scream and his shout echoing through the jungle.� Exhausted, we lay still connected and fell
into a deep sleep.

&nbsp;

After that evening, we decided it was foolish to attempt to
cover our nakedness.� Our clothes were in
such disrepair anyway, we simply abandon the silly conventions and spent our days nude.� When Jim
would look at me and smile in a certain way, I would smile back and the two of
us would fuck until we couldn�t move.� It
was an idyllic setting and we were once again Adam and Eve in the Garden of
Eden.� It seemed that we had everything
we needed and rescue was a distant dream.

&nbsp;

I don�t know how long we had been on the island before the
day I decided to do some exploring. �Jim
and I had made love that morning to the accompaniment of my screams of
pleasure.� With his cum dripping down my
thighs, I laughed and ran down the beach, splashing in the gentle waves that
washed the shore.� I had seldom roamed
far from our little camp but that day I decided to see more of our island.

&nbsp;

You see, I looked at it as our private little world,
undisturbed by the witless demands of the world we had left.� Our days consisted of sleeping, eating,
drinking and fucking.� What more could a
person want?

&nbsp;

I have no idea how far I wandered from our camp.� I had been gone well over an hour and
developed a ravenous appetite.� Wandering
into the inner jungle in search of some fruit I soon became disoriented and
couldn�t find my way back to the beach.�
The further I went, the more lost I became until I became terrified that
I wouldn�t find my way back.� The jungle
was so dense, the sun was virtually hidden from view,
making it impossible to determine my directions.� The undergrowth tore at my flesh and I began
to bleed from several small scratches on my hips and breasts.

&nbsp;

Suddenly I stopped.�
Staring at me from behind a large bush were two large eyes.� The face behind them was painted in several
colors but the underlying flesh was black.�
I turned to run but I was greeted with another pair of eyes.� Each direction I turned I found myself
surrounded by these painted faces, staring silently at me.� I decided to make a dash for it and darted
through the brush, ignoring the scrapes and abrasions from the undergrowth.� I had not traveled more than a few yards
before strong arms grasped me around the shoulders. As I opened my mouth to
scream, a hand clasped over my lips, muffling my cries for help.� More hands grasped my ankles and lifted my
legs from the ground until I was held in the air, parallel to the earth.� I felt rough ropes being wrapped around my
wrists and ankles, tied so tight that I cried out in pain.� A long pole slid between my arms and legs and
I was hoisted into the air, slung by my arms and legs like a bundle of
wash.� Off we went through the jungle at
a rapid pace, the brush tearing at my exposed back and butt.� I was bounced up and down, my tits flopping
obscenely and my breath coming in gasps.�


&nbsp;

After what seemed an eternity, we cleared the jungle and I
saw that we were once again on a beach.�
Two dugout canoes had been pulled up on the sand and it was into one of
these that my body was thrown.� With a
shout, the natives pushed off into the water and began to paddle
furiously.� Frightened and exhausted, I
fell into a dark hole, seeking comfort from unconsciousness.

&nbsp;

LATER

&nbsp;

I have no idea how long I lay in the bottom of that
canoe.� I was brought back when arms
lifted me and the pole once again placed between my arms and legs.� Again we started back through the jungle,
with me bouncing up and down lewdly.�
After a while we came to a clearing and I could hear the shouts and
murmurs of others.� When I was lowered to
the ground, I saw dozens of natives gathered around me, staring down at me with
curious eyes.� There were both men and
women, young and old, and even several children surrounding me.� All of them were as naked as I and their dark
skin glistened as if they had bathed in oil.

&nbsp;

I was lifted to my feet and, for the first time, could get
an impression of my surroundings.� I was
in the middle of a large clearing in the jungle with small huts lining the
edges of the clearing.� It was obviously
a campground of the natives as several small fires were burning here and there
and the smell of food cooking filled my nostrils.

&nbsp;

For some strange reason, I was not particularly afraid,
although the stares I received from both the men and the women did nothing to
reassure me.� I tried to indicate that I
was hungry and thirsty, but my pantomime was unsuccessful.� Gratefully, I held up my arms as the rope was
cut from both my wrists and ankles.� I
rubbed my arms to restore some circulation but was instantly seized by my
shoulders and half pushed, half dragged toward the other side of the clearing.

&nbsp;

I was taken to an area that was apart from the huts, just at
the edge of the clearing.� Two posts
stood a few feet apart and it was between these that I was taken.� Ropes once again encircled my wrists and my
arms were raised from my sides and lashed to the two posts.� More ropes were tied to my ankles and my legs
pulled wide apart to be secured to the posts.�
I was now securely tied in a spread position and fear finally overtook
me.� Expecting the worst, I was surprised
when the crowd of natives dispersed, leaving me hanging between the posts
alone.

&nbsp;

Left to my thoughts, I wondered about Jim.� Would he come looking for me?� As far as I knew, I could be on a completely
different island.� My idyllic world had
suddenly come to an end.� Tears ran down
my cheeks while I awaited whatever fate these strange
people had in store for me.

TWO

&nbsp;

I hung there all day while the natives went about their
business, ignoring me completely.� A
dozen or so of the men began building a small scaffold near the center of the
clearing, covering it with palm leaves and flower decorations.� It appeared that some sort of celebration was
going to take place and I wondered if I was going to be the feature attraction.

&nbsp;

Toward dusk, six of the women came to me with small jars of
oil and began to rub it all over my body.�
The oil smelled like orchids and felt warm against my flesh.� Their hands covered me completely from neck
to toe and the longer they worked, the warmer my skin got.� It also had the effect of making me extremely
horny and I squirmed uneasily under the touch of these women.� One of the women held a stone flask to my
lips and I drank deeply of a bitter potion, seeking only to satisfy my
thirst.� I grew a little dizzy at first
and then felt a warmth surge through my body that was almost overwhelming.� My animalistic inner being took over and I
yearned for sexual release.

&nbsp;

Finally, they were satisfied with their efforts and left me
alone once again.� It was growing dark
now and the men started a huge fire in the center of the clearing.� Drums started to beat and a chant rose from
the natives as they gathered about the fire.�
All of them were bouncing up and down to the rhythm of the drums and
chanting some words that I couldn�t understand.�
The rhythm flooded my brain and hypnotized me until I was almost in a
trance.

&nbsp;

This went of for at least an hour until everyone was in a frenzy as they circled the fire pit.� With a shout, they broke the circle and
started toward where I hung suspended between the two posts.� My wrists and ankles were freed and I was lifted
high into the air, supported by dozens of hands that held me horizontally.� Still chanting loudly, they carried me aloft
as they trotted in huge circles around the fire.� By now, the oil on my flesh was beginning to
get really warm and I was in a high state of lust. 

&nbsp;

Around and around the fire we circled, chanting and dancing
while I was bounced up and down in sync with the movements of the hands holding
me aloft.� My tits were all over the
place and I wanted desperately to hold them but my hands were not free.� The world was whirling about me and I felt as
if I was going to explode.

&nbsp;

The dancing suddenly stopped but the drums continued their
beat as I was lowered toward the ground.�
But it was not the earth that I lay upon but the scaffold that I had
watched them construct that afternoon.�
My arms were raised over my head and I felt ropes tie my wrists to the
two upper corners.� My legs were spread
wide apart and tied to the other corners.�
My butt was barely on the edge of the scaffold and I realized that my
pussy was wide open and easily accessible.�
It was then that I understood the purpose of this ritual.

&nbsp;

It was obviously the chief that appeared between my thighs;
his headdress his only article of clothing.�
I raised my head and stared at the biggest, thickest cock I�d ever seen
in my life; throbbing with a life of its own and poised to enter me.� Two women came and stood at my side,
massaging my breasts and rubbing my nipples.�
At that point I was so overcome, I could only
swallow hard as the chief moved forward.�
When he entered me, I cried out in delight. My pussy contracted and
pulled him into me with a force that surprised me.� The muscles in my stomach began to clinch and
relax as he moved in and out, sending wave after wave of desire to my brain.

&nbsp;

The drum beat and the chanting brought me to the edge of
delirium and my body was rising to meet the forward thrust of the native�s
cock.� As his seed spilled inside me, I
screamed to announce my orgasm.�
Everything became blurred and my only sensation was of overwhelming
lust.� Strange sounds were coming from my
throat while my body continued to bounce up and down.� I whimpered as he withdrew, longing for more.

&nbsp;

I was not to be disappointed.� Another took his place and another after
him.� I could hear myself shrieking but I
was consumed with pleasure.� Sweating
heavily, I fought for my breath as orgasm after orgasm exploded inside me.� It seemed as if every man in the tribe was
fucking me.� Someone grabbed my head and
I saw a cock hovering above my face.�
Instinctively I opened my mouth and received it between my lips.� I was now impaled upon two cocks, enmeshed in
the most erotic experience of my life.�
Two cocks were placed in my imprisoned hands and I began to milk them.� I had become an animal, seeking release in
any way possible.

&nbsp;

I felt the cock in my mouth begin to throb and quickly my
mouth was filled with cum.� I swallowed
as fast as I could but felt some dribble from the corners of my mouth.� With a loud grunt, the man between my legs
shot his sperm deep inside me while my pussy gripped his shaft tightly.� Warm strings of cum shot over my stomach from
the two men I was milking.� The women at
my side bent down and began to suck at my nipples, sending me into a paroxysm
of desire.� I couldn�t get enough.� Another man entered my pussy and still another
entered my mouth.� I was experiencing one
continuous orgasm that threatened to render me unconscious.

&nbsp;

My ravishment seemed to last forever.� Just as I was on the verge of hysteria, my
arms and legs were freed and I was once again lifted into the air and carried
horizontally.� Bouncing up and down to
the beat of the drums, I was transported around and around the clearing to the
unearthly chant of the natives.� Cum
flowed from my sopping pussy and covered my face and belly.� My cunt burned with the flame of a thousand
fires and I grew weak from exhaustion.�
After several minutes, I was carried back to the two posts and my arms raised to be tied once again above my head.� Unable to resist, I allowed my body to once
again be spread between the two uprights.�
Totally exhausted, my chin fell to my chest and I passed out.

&nbsp;

LATER

&nbsp;

I awakened sometime later to find that the sun had come up
and two of the women were washing my body with a cloth and water.� One of them held a jar to my lips and I once
again drank the bitter liquid that they had fed me the previous night.� Instantly a warmth
surged through my body and the sensuous feelings that overcame me last evening
started again.� Dazed and confused, I
felt one of the women grasp my left tit.�
Expecting her to massage it, I screamed as she thrust a long needle
through the meat of my breast.� Wide
awake now, I stared down at my injured breast and found a needle that appeared
to be made of bone protruding several inches on either side of my tit, just
behind my nipple.� Before I could
protest, she had grasped my other tit and speared it with a similar needle.

&nbsp;

�Aaarrggghhhhhh!!!� I screamed, my
body shaking within the tight restraints.�
In complete shock I stared down at two pieces of bone piercing my
breasts.

&nbsp;

Calmly and unperturbed, the two women took crudely fashioned
rings, also made of a material that appeared to be bone and that had been
bisected at one point, and bent them just slightly so that one edge was offset
from the other.� Working the bone needles
that pierced my flesh, they replaced them with the rings, carefully burying the
broken edges deep inside my bosom.� I was
breathing so hard, they had to hold my breasts firmly until they had finished
their work.� Finally they stepped back
and I stared down at two large rings, hanging from my tits.

&nbsp;

When they grabbed my chin, I screamed once more as one of
the women approached one more time with one of the bone needles.� Incredulously, they held me tight in a
vise-like grip while the one with the needle pierced my septum.� The pain was so bad I blacked out.

&nbsp;

I couldn�t have been out long before I regained
consciousness to feel something being affixed to the lower part of my
nose.� With my tongue, I explored the
upper part of my lip, to find the shape of a ring hanging there.

&nbsp;

�Ohhhhhhh, God! NOOOOOOOO!!!!� I
screamed.� Permanently marred, I sobbed
in desperation.� The native women paid me
little notice as tears flowed down my cheeks.

&nbsp;

For the next hour, I experienced the ultimate degradation as
the two women proceeded to pluck all of my pubic hairs from my body.� With each tug, I cried out and shook but it
did not deter the work of the natives.�
Finally, they finished and I could stare down at my denuded pussy.�� Strangely, I felt a wave of wantonness sweep
over me while I viewed the two rings hanging from my nipples and my naked sex.

&nbsp;

The women released me from the two poles and I rubbed my
wrists to restore some circulation.�
Having been restrained for so long, I found it difficult at first to
stand but soon gathered my strength and took a couple of steps.� To my consternation, one of the women took a
long strip of leather and tied it to the ring in my nose.� Grasping the other end like a leash, I was
led around the clearing like an animal, on display for the rest of the
tribe.� The men laughed as they watched
me paraded about, and I suffered the worst humiliation of my life.� When everyone had seen the work of the native
women, they took me to one of the grass huts and tied one of my ankles to a
rope attached to the main support post of the shack.� I was left alone for the rest of the day,
except for an occasional visit by one of the women who would bring me some
cooked meat and more of that vile liquid they kept offering me to drink.

&nbsp;

That night was a repeat of the first night.� The drums started to beat about sundown and
several of the women came in the hut and began to anoint me with oil.� My body began to throb with passion as the
oil warmed my flesh.� Then several of the
men came to the shack, untied me, and hoisted me in the air as they had done
before.� Again I was carried out into the
clearing and marched around in a circle for several minutes before being
carried to the small stage where my arms and legs were securely anchored.� For the second night in a row, I was
plundered by every man in the tribe until I lay exhausted with cum covering my
body and dripping from my newly bared pussy.�
Again, after I was paraded around the clearing they hung me up between
the posts where I spent another exhaustive night.

&nbsp;

Days passed and the routine never varied.� I spent my day inside one of the huts, tied
to a post and at night I was fucked until I collapsed.� My pussy was so sore I couldn�t bear to think
about another bout with the tribesmen but invariably the drums started their
imposing message each evening at sundown.

&nbsp;

Time became meaningless in my life since each day was no
different from the last.� When I noticed
that my stomach was beginning to swell and I experienced nausea daily, I began
to wonder if I were pregnant.�
Eventually, I had no doubt:� I was
going to have a baby!

&nbsp;

My delicate condition was no determent to the nightly
ceremony.� Only until I was near delivery
did they spare me the evening ravishment.�
When the labor pains began, I cried out and two of the native women came
to the shack to minister to me.� While I
lay on a crude cloth blanket with my legs spread and raised in the air, a
little black boy popped out of my uterus.�
The native women laughed and caressed my cheek as they placed him on my
stomach. �I felt the strangest sensation
as I gathered my newly born son to my breast and allowed him to suckle.

&nbsp;

The days following the birth of my son were spent happily
holding him and allowing him to feed at my breast.� The native women were very attentive and even
allowed me some freedom to move about the camp grounds.� I was never out of eyesight, however, and the
thought of escape really never occurred to me.�
You may think it odd that I was comfortable in my surroundings but I had
not been harmed in any way since my capture.�
To the contrary, I had experienced a sexual satisfaction that, before I
was captured, would have never been achievable.�
Yes, I enjoyed Jim�s company (I wonder what happened to him) but the
gratification was fleeting, unlike my experience with the natives.� In short, I was at peace with myself and my
environment.� Motherhood had brought out
a side of me that I was never aware of.

&nbsp;

Months went by without incident and soon we were back to the
nightly rituals.� I wondered why none of
the other young native girls were used as I and with the smattering of words
that I had learned from one of the women, I found that
they considered me to be a white goddess.�
Intercourse with me was to guarantee immortality.� Of course, they could fuck me to death but
they would live forever!� Nevertheless, I
accepted my role and even became to look forward to it.� It was as if my prior life had never existed.

&nbsp;

My contentment was shattered one day when I awoke to the
sound of gunfire.� I rushed from my hut
to find a dozen white men with rifles leveled at the tribe.� Zooma, the tribal
chief, was arguing strongly in his native language and gesturing fiercely
toward the whites.� Suddenly, one of the
white men raised his rifle and shot Zooma.� I screamed and ran to him, cradling his head
in my arms.� His eyes were dazed and
blood poured form a wound in his chest.�
I moaned as I rocked his body back and forth, holding him as he drew his
last breath.

&nbsp;

�Well, look what we have here!�

&nbsp;

The voice behind me brought me back to reality and I
suddenly recognized that I was naked in front of a group of white men.� I screamed as my arms were grasped and I was
lifted from the ground.

&nbsp;

THREE

&nbsp;

While I was
held tightly by two men, I watch in horror as, one by one, members of the tribe
were executed.� I screamed as my son was
shot in the head and lay dead at my feet.�
For more than an hour the slaughter continued until only five other
young women and myself remained alive.

&nbsp;

We were
lined up in a single file and stood while ropes were tied around our
wrists.� We were then put in coffle with
rope around our neck and, at the urging of whips, began marching through the
jungle.� A glance back revealed the camp
blazing with the dead strewn about in the center ground.� I sobbed in despair as my final vision was of
my dead son, resting with the other tribal people.

&nbsp;

For more
than an hour we marched through the undergrowth, frequently prodded by a rifle
butt or whip to move faster.� I could
hear some of the women in front of me crying softly as we marched and struggled
to hold back my own tears.� What fate
awaited the six of us I didn�t know but I was sure that it would not be pleasant.

&nbsp;

Finally we
reached the beach and I was startled to see a sailing ship anchored a few
hundred yards off shore.� A two masted schooner, it seemed a relic of the past.� We were shoved into a large row boat that had
been pulled up on the beach and sat silently as the men began rowing toward the
larger ship.

&nbsp;

A large
cargo net was swung over the side of the ship and the six of us were thrown
into it.� Unceremoniously, we were lifted
high in the air and swung onto the deck of the schooner.� After disengaging myself from five sweating
bodies, I stood and surveyed my surroundings.�
My hands were still tied behind my back and I wanted very much to cover
myself.� I decided that modesty was
simply a state of mind and so I thrust my body forward defiantly at the same
time a cabin door opened and a large man strode onto the deck.

&nbsp;

He was
huge!� His arms that protruded from a
dirty white T-shirt were as big as my thighs!�
His face was almost hidden behind a black, bushy beard but his black
eyes were like knives that penetrated my very soul.� He adjusted an equally dirty Captain�s hat on
his head and stared at the six of us for several long minutes.� I had never felt more naked than when his
eyes covered me from top to bottom.

&nbsp;

�The name�s
Hawk!� Captain Hawk!�� His words were lost on all but me as my
companions stared at him curiously.�
Sensing that, he directed his eyes toward me.

&nbsp;

�Where are
you taking us?� I cried, boldly.

&nbsp;

�To the
slave markets, whore!� he bellowed.� �I
expect you will draw a pretty penny, compared to your negra
friends here!�

&nbsp;

�You are a
monster!� I shouted. �Killing poor innocent people!� You despicable ,
loathsome. . .�

&nbsp;

My head
snapped back as his hand struck my cheek with all of his strength.� My vision blurred as tears formed in my eyes
and I felt a trickle of blood seep from the corner of my mouth.

&nbsp;

�Shut your
mouth, whore!� You will learn your
station or suffer the consequences!�
Shark, teach these slaves what happens to those who resist orders!�

&nbsp;

Tamara was
the first of us taken and lashed to the main mast.� She looked back in terror as the man called
Shark unfurled a black bull whip and positioned himself a few feet behind
her.� His arm shot forward and the
leather band seemed to uncurl in slow motion, burying itself between Tamara�s
shoulder blades.� She screamed in agony
as a vivid red welt suddenly sprang up where the whip had touched her.

&nbsp;

Again Shark
struck with the whip and once more Tamara screamed in agony as her body surged
forward against the mast.� Another red
welt appeared parallel to the first and she shook in a frenzy of pain while
sobs echoed from her throat.

&nbsp;

A third
lash crossed the first two and Tamara threw back her head and shrieked the most
unearthly cry I have ever heard.� Sobbing
uncontrollably, her body sank and she hung suspended by her wrists.� One of the crewmen untied her hands and she
collapsed to the deck, curled in a fetal position while continuing to wail her
distress.

&nbsp;

Uta was
next and she started screaming the instant they began to tie her arms around
the mast.� Her cries continued unabated
as she received three strokes of the whip and fell to join Tamara on the deck.

&nbsp;

Down the
line they moved, each girl being lashed to the mast to receive three blows of
Shark�s whip.� I was the last in line.

&nbsp;

As my hands
were being tied while I hugged the wooded shaft, I heard Captain Hook�s orders.

&nbsp;

�Turn this
one around!� I want her to see it
coming!�

&nbsp;

I was
turned with my back against the mast and my arms raised high over my head where
they were tied to a hook above me.� I
glared defiantly at the Captain as Shark unfurled his whip.

&nbsp;

I can�t
describe the incredible pain of a whip against bare flesh.� My vision blurred into a red haze while I
clinched my teeth; determined not to give these slavers the benefit of my
torment.� I wondered if my flesh had been
torn as the leather snaked around my waist, leaving a vivid trail of pain in
its wake.� My legs began to shake and my
breath came in huge gasps.� I had barely
recovered when the second stroke buried itself across my thighs.� My legs collapsed beneath me and I swung
limply by my wrists.� Sweat poured from
my body and I found it almost impossible to fill my lungs with air.� Snot dripped from my nose and I shook my head
in astonishment that something could hurt so much.

&nbsp;

What I
found was that the first two strokes were simply a prelude to the real
agony.� The third found my quivering
breasts and I was certain that my nipples had been ripped from my body.� My resolve disappeared and my screams echoed
throughout the ship.� I lost control of
my bladder and pissed all over my legs and the deck.� I shook my head frantically waiting for the
pain to dissolve.� When my hands were
released, I fell to my hands and knees, unable to stand.� My breath was coming in gasps.� My hair hung down over my face as I cupped one
hand against my injured tits, sobbing despairingly.

&nbsp;

�Crawl, bitch!� Crawl over here and hug my leg!�

&nbsp;

My brain
was swimming in a pool of suffering as I, without thinking, began to crawl
across the deck, mewling like a sick calf.�
When I reached the Captain�s boots, I wrapped my arms around his lower
leg and hugged him with all of my strength.�
My reaction, I later realized, was like a punished child attempting to
gain favor with her father.

&nbsp;

�Get these
slaves to the cages!� the Captain shouted, as he kicked me away.� I felt hands grabbed me under my arms and
lift me from the deck.� I was dragged to
a hole in the deck and sensed that I was being lowered.� Another set of hands took me by my hips and
carried me a short distance where I felt myself being placed inside a metal
contrivance.� At that point exhaustion
overcame me and I passed out.

&nbsp;

LATER

&nbsp;

The metal
contrivance, as I found when I awoke, was a steel cage; no more than three feet
square and six feet long.� Stacked one on
top of the other, they were the quarters for slaves.� If you were unfortunate enough to be beneath
one or more of the cages, as I was, you were the receptacle for all bodily
waste of the ones caged above you.� A
glass container affixed to the end of the cage was equipped with a straw
through which I was able to drink rank water.�
We were handed pieces of hard bread and tough, stringy meat once each
day.

&nbsp;

The first
day of our captivity we were taken to the ship�s blacksmith where we were
outfitted with steel bands around our wrists, ankles and throat.� Small rings attached to the bands were joined
by lengths of chain that connected our wrists and ankles.� The ring was removed from my nose but those
hanging from my breasts were left in place.�
The chains were an additional reminder that we were slaves and would be
treated as such.

&nbsp;

For thirty
minutes twice each day we were allowed on deck to parade around to the
accompaniment of hoots and jeers from the crew.�
Our job was to scrub the deck with small brushes while Shark encouraged
us with a riding crop.� Mindlessly, I
labored like a robot; memories of that awful whip still fresh in my mind.� Days passed without significant change and
the six of us were soon submissively conditioned to our adversity.� Although several of my companions were
sexually assaulted during the brief stay on the deck, I, fortunately, was
spared of this degrading experience.

&nbsp;

Over a week
into the voyage toward our destiny of slavery, I was summoned in the middle of
the night from my cage by Shark.

&nbsp;

�Cap�n wants to see you!� he remarked as I extricated myself
from the cramped quarters of my cage.�
Someone above me had pissed all over my back and Shark hosed me down
before leading me up a ladder to the main deck.�
I was led to the Captain�s room where I found him sitting in a large upholdstered chair.�
He was completely naked.

&nbsp;

I stared at
him indifferently although I was taken aback by the amount of body hair
covering his immense body.� Nestled
between his fat belly and huge thighs was a thick cock.� 

&nbsp;

�Come here,
whore!� he shouted, spreading his thick legs apart.� �I need servicing!�

&nbsp;

The thought
of taking that cock in my mouth was so repellant, I shouted back without
thinking.

&nbsp;

�Go fuck
yourself!�

&nbsp;

His face
turned red as he stood up from his chair.�
�You will learn not to defy me, slave!�
Shark!�

&nbsp;

He must
have been listening at the door because he entered the room immediately.

&nbsp;

�Aye!
Aye! Captain!�

&nbsp;

�Haul �er!� And make sure
the rest of those bitches watch!� I�ll
show them not to disobey!�

&nbsp;

Shark
jerked me around and pulled me out of the Captain�s quarters and onto the main
deck.� I was half pulled, half dragged
over to the main mast where the chain connecting my wrists was looped over the
hook high over my head.� I expected the
whip again but Shark left me hanging there for the rest of the night.

&nbsp;

As dawn
broke, I heard a commotion and, looking over my shoulder, I saw my companions
being led up on the deck.� They were soon
joined by most of the crew who stood in a semi-circle around me.� Shark came and unhooked my wrists from the
mast.� He had a long length of rope that
he used to tie one end around the chain binding my wrists and the other end
around the chain binding my ankles.� With
several of the crew following, I was manhandled to the bow of the boat and
watched as Shark threw the length of rope across the bow and into the
ocean.� I instantly felt a tug against my
wrists and ankles and turned to stare at Shark in surprise.

&nbsp;

�Say hello
to my relatives,� he grinned as he gave me a shove.� Stunned, I felt myself falling off of the
ship and into the water.

&nbsp;

The rope
tightened and I was stretched taut against the hull of the ship as the waves
pounded against my body.� Slowly, I felt
myself being pulled across the hull by my feet.�
The rough wood and barnacles cut into my flesh but I was only aware of
my inability to breathe.� Panicky, I
struggled to hold my breath as long as I could while I continued my journey
across the bow of the boat.� Just as I
reached the point where I could hold it no longer, I felt my feet clear the
water and soon I was hauled back up on the deck, gasping and retching.� 

&nbsp;

Before I
could recover, the rope yanked against my feet and I was over the side once
again.� I inhaled a lung full of air as
best I could but the force of the waves beating against me knocked much of it
out of me.� An eternity passed before my
head broke above the water and I was hauled up again on the deck, gasping for
breath.

&nbsp;

Once more I
felt the tug against my wrists and I screamed as I dove over the side of the
ship and began my third journey across the hull. I fought and struggled to no
avail as the water hammered against me and my body scraped against the rough
surface of the ship.� I have no
recollection of my final passage until I came to lying on the deck, puking up
salt water.� At that point, I would have
fucked and sucked every man on that ship. Anything to avoid
another trip across the hull. Instead I was carried to the bowsprit and
lashed to the bow just a few feet above the water line.� Each dip of the bow sent water spraying
across me as the ship sailed onward.� For
the entire day, I spent as the maiden of the bowsprit, puking and retching
until I hung exhausted at day�s end.

FOUR

&nbsp;

The voyage
lasted three weeks.� After my ordeal of
being keel-hauled, I was the most submissive slave on board.� Anytime the Captain or one of the crew even
glanced my way, I flopped on my back and spread my legs.� I was fucked at least a dozen times a day,
frequently in full display of the rest of the crew.� Strangely, I took some pleasure from these
experiences and often displayed wild and uncontrollable orgasms as I was raped
in full view of the crew.� I would be on
my hands and knees, my tits bouncing wildly beneath me as my rapist would pound
his meat into me while I screamed my pleasure.

&nbsp;

As the
ship�s main whore, I avoided many hours in the cages below decks for which I
was thankful.� This did not mean I
escaped unscathed.� Aside from the sexual
assaults, I was strung up on the mast each day and received five strokes of the
whip.� Even this became something I
almost looked forward to as the pain sent me into a state of mind that bordered
on the erotic.� The first time I had an
orgasm while being whipped stunned me.�
My body was rubbing against the post while the whip tattooed my back and
I screamed; not in agony but ecstasy.�
When I was let loose, I lay on the deck gasping; my body covered in
sweat, and my pussy sopping wet as well.�
My mind was awhirl with conflicting sensations.� What was happening to me?� Julie Hudson, professional photographer was
now no more than a pain slut?� I was too
confused to sort out the answer.� My hand
unconsciously crept between my legs and stroked my swollen clit.� I lived only for the moment.� There was no past, no future.� Julie Hudson, sex slave, pain slut, whore,
fuck meat, cock sucker, masochist and exhibitionist.� I even learned to take it up the ass and
enjoy it.

&nbsp;

This is
how it began:� I was in the Captain's quarters
for my nightly fuck soon after my ordeal beneath this ship's waters. Down on
all fours, I was rocking back and forth in rhythm to Hawk's thrusts, grunting
like a sow in heat.� My tits were swaying
back and forth like a sack of marbles and sweat dripped from the tips of my
nipples to puddle on the floor beneath me.

&nbsp;

Suddenly
Hawk paused, withdrew his cock from my sopping pussy, spread my cheeks and
poised the head of his cock at the entrance to my puckered hole.

&nbsp;

&quot;NO!� OH, GOD!�
PLEASE DON'T WAIT!� OH, GOD. . .
.&quot;

&nbsp;

But he
didn't wait.� Hawk plunged his cock into
my dry ass hole as I screamed in anguish.�
God, it hurt!� It hurt bad!� I was sure he was going to tear me apart as
he began to pump in and out. I was sobbing unmercifully while my insides felt
as if they were on fire.� But, gradually,
my sphincter muscles began to relax and it no longer hurt as much.� My lasciviousness returned as I felt his
belly slap against my butt and soon I was rocking back and forth as before,
grunting with each stroke.� When Hawk
reached under me and flicked my clit with his thumb I went over the edge.� I shrieked in pleasure at the precise moment
I felt his cock erupt and send his load of cum deep into my bowels.� Hawk continued to pump into me as my orgasm
gradually receded.� I was gasping for
breath and my heart was beating ninety miles an hour.� Finally I collapsed on my belly with Hawk
lying on top of me.� A faint groan of
satisfaction from his throat was echoed by me.

&nbsp;

From that
moment on, I wore the knob end of a belaying pin stuck up my ass wherever I
went, only to be removed when the Captain or one of the crew was fucking
me.� After a brief period my sphincter
stretched until I was able to accept most cocks without difficulty.� A new Julie Hudson: bunghole jumper!

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

�Land ho!�
came the cry from high up the mast and everyone scurried to the ship�s
rail.� I was in the midst of my afternoon
scourging and was left to seek release by rubbing my pussy against the mast.� The crew began to bustle about, hauling in
some sail and raising others while I was left hanging on the mast, ignored in
the preparations.� Finally, the other
five women were brought up from below and I was released from the mast.� The six of us were lifted up on the rigging
and lashed there as trophies to be displayed as we sailed into port.� With my arms and legs spread wide against the
ropes I watched as the ship docked.� 

&nbsp;

We were
apparently in a fairly large city, the nationality of which I couldn�t
determine.� There were hundreds of people
on the dock, both men and women as well as a few small children.� Their dark skins glistened as ebony and the
whitest teeth I�d ever seen appeared in open mouths They were laughing and
pointing at the six naked women hanging from the rigging as our crew made the
ship fast.� 

&nbsp;

Finally we
were released and lowered to the deck.�
Our hands and ankles were once again joined by links of chain and an
additional link was used to join our collar to the chain binding our wrists.� We were then marched off of the ship, down
the gangplank, and onto the city�s streets.

&nbsp;

In single
file we marched through the city while scores of people stared at us, making
obscene remarks in a language I took to be Italian.� Some of the children threw small rocks at us
to the enjoyment of their parents.� By
the time we had gone three blocks, all of us were sobbing in a mixture of
despair and humiliation.

&nbsp;

Through the
streets they took us until we reached what appeared to be the town square.� A large fountain occupied the center although
no water flowed from it.� Behind the
fountain and on one side of the square was a huge edifice that reminded me of a
bull ring.� There were banners and flags
flying from the top which stood at least four stories tall.� An entrance faced the square that was guarded
by steel bars.� It was here we were taken
as the gate swung open slowly and we entered.

&nbsp;

I could see
through a passage what appeared to be a large arena but we were taken to a
flight of stairs leading down beneath the building.� Down and down we went until I guessed we were
at least four flights below the street.�
What greeted me as we arrived there was overwhelming.

&nbsp;

A huge
enclosure lined with steel bars filled almost all of the space.� Inside were at least two dozen people, both
men and women, all naked and chained as I and my five companions.� We were pushed inside the huge cage and the
door clanged shut behind us.

&nbsp;

I glanced
around.� The area was lit by torches that
flickered dimly but gave enough light to easily see our dire surroundings.� The barred enclosure was void of any
furnishings as far as I could see.� The
inmates, who are what we were, were free to move about except all of us bore
heavy chains that clanked against the stone floor whenever we took a step.

&nbsp;

I saw one
of the male slaves fucking one of the women over in a corner and no one was
paying them much attention.� I couldn�t
help but stare at them and I felt my pussy growing wetter by the moment as I
watched.� Unconsciously, my hand crept
between my thighs and a finger slipped inside my lips.

&nbsp;

�Need some
help with that?�

&nbsp;

The voice
behind me startled me so I jumped a little.�
Turning, I found myself face to face with a very handsome man.� In fact, he was an Adonis with broad
shoulders, muscular chest, narrow waist and hips, and . . .wow!

&nbsp;

�I�m sorry,�
he said, �I didn�t mean to startle you.�
My name is Boris.� And you are. .
. ?

&nbsp;

�Julie. .
.I�m sorry, I guess I was sort of lost in thought.�

&nbsp;

�Yes, I
noticed that.� They make an interesting
couple, don�t they?� They�ve been fucking
each other since I arrived here two days ago.�
You would think they would rest once in a while, wouldn�t you.�

&nbsp;

�Hmmmm. . .
.well, they certainly are oblivious to the rest of us.� Anyone who can make the best of this
situation should be applauded.� Or at
least, left alone.�

&nbsp;

�If the
guards catch them, they will be punished.�
They have already been caught once but it doesn�t seem to bother them
all that much.� I watched them being
whipped early this morning and now they�re back at it again.�

&nbsp;

I realized
my hand was still over my cunt and I jerked it away nervously.� A silly grin passed over my face as Boris
smiled at me.

&nbsp;

�How did
you happen to be brought here? I asked, hoping to divert his attention from my
obvious embarrassment.

&nbsp;

�Slavers
kidnapped me last week while I was vacationing in Southern France.� I was drugged and woke up here day before
yesterday.� I have no idea how long I was
unconscious or where we are except this is an obvious slave auction.� What about you?�

&nbsp;

�I was
kidnapped on an island in the South Pacific and brought here on a slaver�s
ship.� I am, or was, a professional
photographer who happened to be involved in an airplane crash somewhere on a
deserted island.� Slavers took me after
I�d been there for more than a year, living with natives.� Five of the native girls were taken with
me.� You can see them over there.�

&nbsp;

�You are
very beautiful, Julie.� I expect they
will demand a high price for you in the auction.�

&nbsp;

�How does
that work?�

&nbsp;

�You�ll be
taken into the arena and displayed.�
Perhaps they will whip you so that you will show them how you react to
the whip.� They will make you degrade
yourself.� Then the auction will begin
and the auctioneer will do things to you in order to raise the bidding.� After what seems an eternity, you will be
sold.�

&nbsp;

I shuddered
involuntarily.� Clutching my arms across
my breasts, I inhaled sharply.

&nbsp;

�After what
I�ve been through the last year, I can�t imagine doing anything more to degrade
myself.� You said you�ve been here two
days.� How often do they hold these
auctions?�

&nbsp;

�Once a
week, I�m told.� The next one is
tomorrow.�

&nbsp;

�Good!� They wouldn�t dare whip us the day before the
auction, would they?�

&nbsp;

LATER

&nbsp;

I awoke in
the arms of Boris and sat up, unsure of where I was for a brief moment.� Around me were the sleeping bodies of the
other slaves.� I heard grunting sounds
and gazed over into the far corner where the same couple were once again
enthusiastically making love.� I smiled
and looked back down at Boris, still asleep.�
The two of us had matched the other couple with loud obscene noises last
night.� I stroked his bare chest and
wished that our circumstances were far different.

&nbsp;

I looked
about for some means of relieving myself but found nothing.� The urge overcame modesty and I found an
empty corner of the cage where I crouched and emptied my bladder.� I saw several of the others doing the same
and realized that we were nothing more than animals, waiting for someone to
take us in.

&nbsp;

Boris was
awake when I returned to his side.� He
smiled up at me and I saw that he had a huge erection.

&nbsp;

�I thought
we took care of that last night!� I exclaimed, wrapping my fingers around is
throbbing shaft.

&nbsp;

�To see you
as you are in the morning stirs my senses.�
I wish our circumstances were different.�
I would like a thousand nights like last night.�

&nbsp;

I was about
to respond when a loud clanging interrupted my thoughts.� I looked up to see several men dressed in
white togas banging on the steel bars that enclosed us.� They had plates of bread and bottles of water
and were throwing them through the bars.�
I suddenly realized I hadn�t eaten since I had left the ship and was
ravenously hungry.� There was a mad
scramble for the food and several fights broke out.� I was pushed about by angry people and thrown
away from the supplies.

&nbsp;

Just when I
gave up any hope of getting something to eat, Boris appeared with two rolls of
bread and two bottles of water.� A thin
cut dripped blood from his arm but he was grinning as he sat down beside me.

&nbsp;

�Desperate
people do desperate things!� he said as he bit into the roll.� I glanced back at the others just as someone
screamed at the top of their lungs.� A
woman staggered out of the circle of people holding her hand between her legs.� Sobbing, she fell to her knees, still
clutching her pussy.� I turned away, unable
to watch her suffering.

&nbsp;

As the
morning wore on, the occupants of the cage began to mill about, talking in a
myriad of different languages.� I
recognized some were Hispanic, some were Asian and others were European but I
did not find any other Americans in the group.�
About noon, the doors opened to the main building and people began to
file in.� Men and women circled the
cages, peering at us curiously and making notes on little tablets as they
moved.

&nbsp;

Despite
myself, I found the experience erotic.�
There is something about being naked in front of fully clothed people
that is at once humiliating and at the same time arousing.� A woman of obvious European ethnicity stood
staring at me for several long minutes.�
In response, I thrust out my breasts and spread my legs.� She stared at me for a few more moments,
smiled and made a note in her book.�
Others passed by and seemed startled to see an American in with the
myriad of other nationalities.� An Asian
man grinned at me and made several notes on his tablet.

&nbsp;

After an
hour or two the people filed out and a number of guards circled the cage.� Two of them entered the enclosure and grabbed
the couple who had been so industriously making love.� The girl cried out and tried to pull away but
she was no match for the guards.� The
couple disappeared from the room, struggling but to no avail.

&nbsp;

Gradually,
the cage was emptied until there were only four of us left.� When the guards came and took me, I looked
back at Boris and he smiled at me, giving me the �thumbs up� signal.� I could hardly agree with his optimism.

&nbsp;

I was taken
to a small room on the same level as the cage where two women oiled my body
until it glistened.� The chains were
removed that bound my wrists and ankles but they left the chain hanging loosely
from my collar and it brushed against my breasts as I walked.� The guards returned and I climbed the long
flight of stairs to my destiny of slavery.
