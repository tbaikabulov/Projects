Synopsis: A woman's sinful past  finally catches up with her






JUSTICIA



Helena Martin stepped off the plane with a huge smile on her face. And, why not, life has been very good to her lately.

Flying first class, she had just landed in Ibiza for a fun weekend with friends at her lover&#8217;s palatial villa, were she expects him to announce their forthcoming engagement, after exclusively dating for the past year.

 Her hoped to be fianc�, was the young, ruggedly handsome and extremely wealthy Juan Antonio Rodriguez de Cuellar, a renowned financial genius, who also happens to be the scion of one of the Spain&#8217;s wealthiest families.&nbsp; Given his sophisticated bearing and impeccable social standing, Juan Antonio Rodriguez de Cuellar had earned the name �El Conde� or �the Count�, from his numerous friends and admirers alike, and would indeed be the catch of the century for any prospective bride.

A few weeks back, Helena was alone in the bedroom of the Conde&#8217;s penthouse suite when she accidentally knocked over his brief case, spilling its contents onto the floor. As she frantically tried to put things in order before the Conde came back from the shower, she noticed a Bulgari ring box among the items that fell out of the brief case. 

Curious at what the box contained, Helena opened it and was amazed to find the biggest and most beautiful diamond ring she had ever seen. Mesmerized by its beauty, Helena took the&nbsp; ring out of its box.&nbsp; As she held it up to examine it against the light, she&nbsp; was almost blinded by the&nbsp; sparkle of the gems and the glitter of its platinum setting.

 Not able to resist, Helena put the ring on and found, to her delight, that it fit her finger perfectly. After admiring the ring on her hand for a couple of minutes, Helena reluctantly took it off, to study it even more closely. 

When Helena read what was inscribed on the inside of the ring, her heart suddenly stopped for a second, and began palpitating wildly. For etched on the inside of the ring were the words: � H.M. . . Mi&nbsp; Amor. . . J.A..�.&nbsp; Which, to Helena could only mean, that the Conde really did love her, and would be proposing to her really soon.

Extremely happy at this development, Helena&nbsp;&nbsp; replaced the ring in its box and returned it to the brief case, lest the Conde discover that she had found him out.

 It was with extreme difficulty that Helena was able to overcome her excitement and urge to smother the Conde with love, when he re-entered the room. She just managed to keep cool and collected around the count, and act as if she was no more the wiser. Their love making though that night was the most passionate ever, to the pleasant surprise and utmost enjoyment of the Count.

After a few weeks had passed, Helena was getting impatient that the Conde had not yet brought up the matter of the ring. As she was about to confront him about it, the Conde called her to his lap and while lovingly running his fingers through her hair, told her he would be throwing a little party in Ibiza this week end , where he hoped to make an announcement. Their lovemaking that followed was just as hot and torrid as when Helena had found the ring.

As arranged, Helena would make the trip to Ibiza alone and would meet up with El Conde at his villa, where the party would be held. The Conde had an important&nbsp; meeting in Madrid to attend to first and would get to Ibiza&nbsp; on his private jet with a few friends later than Helena. 

As Helena stood by the airport&#8217;s carousel for her luggage, the smile which had earlier adorned her pretty face slowly faded, as unbidden memories of her past came to fore.

You see, life had not always been so kind to Helena.

 Her parents both died in a car accident while she was young, and having no known living relatives, she&nbsp; was raised by nuns in the convent. 

As Helena grew older, so did her beauty blossom. From a gawky pre-teener, Helena evolved into a beautiful raven haired young lady with the angelic face of a Madonna but with a body even Helen of Troy would have died for. She stood around five feet six inches tall and simply oozed with sex appeal. 

She was vivacious, vibrant and to be crude, sexy as hell.&nbsp; Even in her youth, she seemed to attract the attention of both men and women, some of whose interest in her were not innocent at all. This caused the Mother Superior to once remark that Helena was simply not cut out for a cloistered life, and must be therefore prepared for life outside the convent. The good sisters were able to arrange for Helena to take a secretarial course, to enable her to seek gainful employment outside.

After completing the course, Helena was able to find employment in one of the leading banks of Madrid, no doubt aided by the&nbsp; glowing recommendation written by the Mother Superior, in her behalf. Not content with remaining a lowly personal assistant to a low level bank officer, Helena hit the books at night and managed to pass the exam for one of two vacant positions as Accounts Officers of the bank.

On her first day as an accounts officer, Helena met the other one who passed. Her name was Luisa Sevilla, an equally beautiful girl, who was taller than Helena (she stood around five feet eight inches tall) but just as &#8216;simpatica�. In fact were it not for the height difference, they could have been mistaken for twins.

The two immediately hit it off and became close friends. From the first day they met, the two weresimply inseparable and helped each other with their accounts. After work, they would often go out and spend the night sharing intimate tales about their lives. During their outings Luisa would sometimes talk about her fianc� Tony who was now in the United States for a&nbsp; Masteral Degree. Helena mostly talked about her money problems and how she wishes to marry a millionaire to solve all of it. 

Both Helena and Luisa were equally good at their work. When a higher position suddenly became available, the Bank was really at a quandary which of the two girls to promote.

As it so happens, both girls wanted the promotion. Helena, more so than Luisa. Being on her own and not having any money to begin with, Helena really needed the extra income the higher position would provide. Luisa on the other hand, being from a rather well off family, really didn&#8217;t need the money, but wanted the job though to add to&nbsp; her resume. 

When the girls got wind that they were the ones being considered for the promotion, On the surface, they both&nbsp; made it appear that the new job wasn&#8217;t all that important to them, and tongue in cheek even wished each other luck.

Despite her friendship to Luisa, Helena tried everything, and I mean everything, to get the job. However, when one of the managers intimated to her while they were both&nbsp; in bed, that Luisa had the inside track for the promotion, she got desperate and did a very nasty and mean act.

At about that time, Luisa was being sexually harassed by one of the bank&#8217;s senior officers who, just so happens to be married to the daughter of&nbsp; the bank&#8217;s Chairman. After being incessantly badgered by the lecherous lothario, Luisa finally gave in and agreed to go out on a dinner date with him at the hotel suite he always books for occasions such as this. She told Helena all&nbsp; the details of her date in order&nbsp; to let her know where she was, thinking that as a very dear friend, she would not tell a single soul about it. How wrong she was.

After being told by Luisa of&nbsp; the details of her date with the senior officer, Helena made an anonymous phone call to his wife, informing her of&nbsp; husband&#8217;s assignation with a beautiful young lady this evening and divulged to her exactly, the where and when the&nbsp; rendezvous would take place.

As Helena&nbsp; expected, the Chairman&#8217;s daughter immediately stormed the hotel where the supposed lovebirds would be&nbsp; having their fun, What she didn&#8217;t expect, however, was that she made the assault with a battalion of paparazzi hoping to catch her husband and the slut he was with, in flagrante delicto.

After having the door to the room broke open, the Chairman&#8217;s daughter barged&nbsp; in just in time to witness Luisa stepping out of the bathroom wearing just the hotel&#8217;s guest robe, while her husband was laying in the bed, presumably naked under the sheets. That was the scene likewise captured by the dozen or so paparazzi vultures who accompanied her, which made its way to all national and local dailies and tabloids, and even internationally, through CNN and the BBC.

(n.b. Although the adage �a picture is worth a thousand words� may be true, things were really not what it would seem in this case. Luisa had no intention of sleeping with, or of even performing any sexual act with the senior bank officer. For the whole evening she had been able to successfully fight off any and all advances he made till he finally conceded defeat. However, when he proposed a toast to the only girl who had supposedly successfully kept her virtue intact from him; he somehow �accidentally� spilled his drink all over her one piece dress. Because of this, Luisa had to remove her ruined dress and slip into the hotel robe while she washes the stain out, not knowing that the devious lech had stripped completely naked and got under the sheets, in an underhanded bid to get her to bed.) 

What got worse for Luisa, was that the chairman&#8217;s daughter peremptorily attacked her without warning and managed to whisk the robe away from the surprised young lady. This Pearl Harbor attack caused her utter lack of underwear to be exposed to the whole world (She had to take both her bra and panties off as well, since the wine had seeped through her chiffon dress), thanks once more to the pack of paparazzi hyenas present. 

(Fortunately for Luisa what appeared in the syndicated news networks as well as the major broadsheets were images of her with her private parts pixilated. However, when it came to the tabloids, no such concession was allowed her, as she appeared on the front pages, in all her naked glory. Thank goodness most had gotten&nbsp; her name wrong and simply referred to her as �La Mysteriosa Mujer�. Although one particularly trashy tabloid did have her completely nude body prominently on display in&nbsp; its front page with her face clearly visible, and with the caption �Srta. Luisa Sevilla, La Puta Otro No?� [whore or not])

In all fairness to Helena, she did not expect nor intended for things to get so out of hand. All she only wanted was to knock Luisa from the running so as to get that promotion. Like how would she know that the outraged wife would be such a harridan as to publicly humiliate her husband&#8217;s supposed paramour in front of the world wide media. 

As a result of the media frenzy brought about by this sordid affair, and the fact that countless nude photos and video clips of a very naked Luisa, were circulating in the internet as well as the cellular phones of most of the bank&#8217;s employees, the bank had to let Luisa go. The bank had to come up with such drastic action, not only to protect its image, but did so upon the insistence of the Chairman&#8217;s daughter, who by the way had forgiven her errant husband and they were now on their umpteenth honeymoon, but would never forgive the shameless hussy who had tried to take her loving husband away from her.

&nbsp; Needless to say, Helena got the promotion.

Helena tried to get in touch with Luisa to console her for what had happened to her, but her friend seemed to have disappeared from the face of the earth. After slinking away from the office with all her stuff, Luisa moved out of her apartment without any forwarding address. She simply vanished from the face of the earth. After a few days, Helena stopped trying to look for Luisa, as she settled in to the rigors of her new job,and simply all but forgotten about her. 

With the departure of Luisa, Helena inherited most of her accounts. She diligently&nbsp; poured herself into her work and pretty soon, she&nbsp; slowly but surely&nbsp; made her way up the corporate ladder. 

Much to Helena&#8217;s delight, among&nbsp; clients she inherited from Luisa was the Conde. At first, everything was just business between them, but her constant flirting&nbsp; managed to catch his&nbsp; eye&nbsp; and they&nbsp; began&nbsp; dating. After being together for about a year, Helena fervently hoped their relationship would move on to the next stage, as the Conde was the answer to all her dreams.

The smile returned to Helena&#8217;s face when she saw the chauffer driven Rolls Royce awaiting her. She could not help but fall in love with the beauty of this idyllic Balieric isle as they made their way to the Conde&#8217;s Villa.

When they got to the Conde&#8217;s Villa, Helena could not help but marvel and be in awe of the grandeur of the Conde&#8217;s palatial home away from home. She could not suppress the thought that someday, this palace would soon be hers and she would imperiously rule over it, like a queen.

Helena was met at the door by a tall, ravishingly beautiful and voluptuous blond woman. After a brief introduction, Helena learned that her name was Annika, that she was Swedish and that she looks after the villa&nbsp; while the Conde&nbsp; is away. She was casually attired in a tight floral print sundress, which was not your typical housekeeper&#8217;s uniform. ( Helena made a mental note to get rid of her as soon as the Conde and her get married, as it really would not do to have such delicious eye&nbsp; candy readily available for her dear husband�s Viewing and other pleasures) 

Before she had a uniformed&nbsp; servant take Helena&#8217;s&nbsp; bags to her rooms, Annika handed over a folded piece of paper to Helena. When Helena opened the paper, she&nbsp; saw that it was a letter from the Conde, telling her that&nbsp; he had something for her in the room , and would she please wear it to the party.

Thinking that at it must surely&nbsp; be the ring, Helena hurried after Annika and the servant. When she got to her suite, Helena looked all over for the Bulgari box, but it was not there. What instead caught her eye was the smallest and most indecent string bikini she had ever seen, lying on top of the bed. 

Helena could only shake her head in disappointment and disbelief. 

For all the veneer of sophistication the Conde exuded, he had this childish quirk of wanting to see Helena put&nbsp; in rather compromising situations that would definitely prove embarrassing to her. Once, he suddenly called a staff meeting at his penthouse suite one night without telling Helena and she was caught by all his associates wearing only a sheer, almost see-through nightie. Another time, he invited her to the country club&nbsp; for a swimming party, but when she got there and had already changed into her bikini, none of the other guests were even remotely&nbsp;&nbsp; in&nbsp; suits, and she had to spend the whole of the party entertaining the guests clad only in her bikini, and she was the only one at that. There were more, much more.

Helena found herself deeply embarrassed whenever the count played his little pranks on her. However, despite all the humiliation she was forced to undergo, Helena tolerated the count&#8217;s perverse delight in her degradation, since she did not want to lose him and gave in to all his �requests�. Looking forlornly at the bikini, Helena wondered whether this was another prank El Conde&nbsp; was playing on her.

Helena&#8217;s musings were cut short when Annika, informed her&nbsp; that the Conde was now on line and would like to speak to her. She was made to face the room&#8217;s gigantic plasma screen on the wall, when all of a sudden the Conde&#8217;s smiling face appeared. He was seated at his desk smiling at the image of Helena appearing in his monitor.

�Hola Helena, how was your trip, mi amor?� He cheerfully said.

�Muy bien, mi Conde, the trip was fine. About the. . .�

Before Helena could say another word, the Count interrupted her.

�Si, it is beautiful no? You will look ravishing in it. I will be the envy of every man and every woman there will be jealous of you.�

�But don&#8217;t you think that it&#8217;s a little too revealing to wear at the Party?� Helena tried to reason.

�So, what if it is, I&#8217;m sure you will be smashing in it.�

As Helena was about to plead her case further, the Conde put an end to all further discussion � Basta mi amor, I would love to see you in that suit for the party.�

The Conde having spoken, Helena could just nod her head in resignation. Nobody could say no to the Conde. Whatever&nbsp; he wanted&nbsp; he got it. 

After dispatching the matter of Helena&#8217;s wardrobe for the party, the Conde turned his attention to Annika and inquired about the party&#8217;s arrangement. After Annika told him that everything was arranged as he instructed, the count turned his attention back to Helena and apologized to her for his absence. He told her to just&nbsp; enjoy the villa on her own for a while, and why not break in the suit and grab some sun, to ensure an all over tan. Although said jokingly, Helena knew this was more of an order than a request. With that, the tele-conferrencing ended.

Annika made her exit to allow Helena some privacy as she tries on her suit. She told Helena to come down for lunch whenever she was ready., before she gets her tan.

Left alone in the room, Helena spent&nbsp; long minutes just staring blankly at the bikini. 

Upon close examination, the bikini appeared&nbsp; to be indecently small&nbsp; even by Ibiza standards. Although not exactly a micro-kini, which only offered coverings for the areoles and vaginal slit, this bikini was just as bad and scandalous.

It had no lining whatsoever and would surely turn transparent at the first sign of water. Its two triangles for the top were so small that they would only be able to cover the front of Helena&#8217;s breasts but not the sides. Likewise for the bottom, its front triangle would only just about cover Helena&#8217;s slit, leaving the rest of her crotch exposed. (It&#8217;s a good thing Helena had the foresight to get a full bikini wax before she left.) As for the back, it came just short of a g-string, and consisted of a very thin strip of cloth running between the cheeks of her ass, leaving both globules fully exposed.

Seeing as there was no way out, that is if she still wanted the chance to be the future �la condesa�, Helena stripped herself of all her clothes and proceeded to put on the suit.

If the bikini looked&nbsp;&nbsp; intimidating just lying spread out on the bed, on Helena it&nbsp; was simply&nbsp; devastating. 

Skimpy beyond belief and about two sizes smaller, the suit was taught against Helena&#8217;s skin and seemed to highlight more the naked flesh around it, rather than serve as a covering for what lay beneath. As suspected, the two triangles that formed the top merely covered about a fourth of Helena&#8217;s breasts, leaving the rest exposed. As for the bottom, the front managed to just about cover her slit, but the back offered no covering whatsoever, as the strip of cloth there found itself firmly lodged in between the cheeks of her ass. It&#8217;s a good thing for Helena that the Conde has her sunbathe in the nude, otherwise she would have very revealing tan lines on show. (Oh yes, there was a time Helena was sunbathing&nbsp; in the patio of the Conde&#8217;s penthouse when he suddenly stepped out with a bunch of workmen, knowing very well Helena would be there. It took all of Helena&#8217;s will power to keep her eyes shut and pretend she was sleeping as the workmen tried to go about their work while trying to avoid ogling her with lustful eyes, at the same time. )

Modeling the bikini in front of the mirror Helena could not help but feel both pride and shame at how she looked. Deciding&nbsp; to provide herself with a little more dignity, Helena put on a pair of open toed high heeled sandals and her long white silk robe, which she often used as a cover up when sunbathing . She belted the robe firmly around her, effectively covering up from neck to toe. Later at the party, she could simply&nbsp; un-belt it and allow the robe to drape on her shoulders, to still&nbsp; be in compliance&nbsp; with the Conde&#8217;s wish that she expose herself in the bikini later at&nbsp; the party. Helena could not help but smile at her cleverness.

After doing a last minute check of her appearance, Helena left the room looking for Annika. She dispensed with wearing any jewelry or other accessories on her, as she wanted the attention of everyone to be directed at the ring on her finger, when the Conde gives it to her&nbsp; this evening.
Helena found Annika at the huge banquet hall were a buffet lunch was set. Helena felt Annika appraising her from head to toe with a disapproving look as she approached, but this was quickly dispelled when the tall Swede gave her a warm smile and complimented her on how beautiful she looked.

Despite the number of gastronomic delights laid out before them, Both Helena and Anneka just had a simple salad and cheese for lunch. They did have wine to go with it, which they had a lot more of than the food. 

During lunch Helena tried to pry Annika for some details about the party. She, however, remained tight lipped and always answered that �it&#8217;s a surprise� with a smile on her face. Otherwise, the lunch went very well with the girls happily chatting it up and exchanging gossip, that Helena started reconsidering her future plan of&nbsp; getting rid of Annika.

After the girls had eaten their fill and declined any dessert, Annika led Helena to the veranda to get some sun. As Annika opened the double glass doors leading out to it, Helena saw that the veranda was huge and offered a panoramic view of the ocean. It could accommodate a full party load of guests for dancing under the stars, together with the full orchestra as well. At the moment the veranda was empty except for two chaise lounges and, and in between, a glass round table with an umbrella on top.

Annika offered to rub oil on Helena as soon as they got to the loungers. Feeling quite relaxed after their repast, Helena nodded her head and took of her robe, finally exposing herself in the bikini to the other girl for the first time. Annika took a sudden intake of breath at the delicious sight of Helena&#8217;s all but naked body. It&#8217;s a good thing she was wearing real dark Chanel sunglasses, which allowed her to openly stare at Helena with hunger and longing in her eyes, without the other girl knowing. 

Annikas hands trembled slightly as she lovingly slathered the oil all over Helena&#8217;s naked flesh. Once she had Helena thickly coated all over, she led her to one of the lounges and helped remove her sandals before laying her down on her back.

After applying some oil on the soles of Helena&#8217;s feet, Annika asked her if she would like a little massage. Being&nbsp; light headed from the heat of the sun and the fullness of her belly, Helena could just manage to purr out her assent. She&nbsp; drowsed&nbsp; off to sleep with Annika&#8217;s magical fingers rubbing her all over.

The sun was much lower in the horizon when Helena was shaken awake. Still a bit groggy from her slumber it took a while for Helena to register Annika&#8217;s smiling down on her, telling her to wake up as the party was starting.

Returning Annika&#8217;s smile, Helena slowly sat up and stretched her arms up to loosen her&nbsp; muscles. It was then that Helena noticed that there was another girl with Annika also smiling at her. She smiled back.

Feeling a bit grungy and sweaty from all the excess oil lathered onto her and from being out under the sun, Helena said she had better take a shower first before she joins the party. However, when she looked around for her robe, it was nowhere in sight. When she asked Annika where it was, the beautiful Swede just laughed and told her that she&nbsp; had put Helen&#8217;s robe and shoes away, since she was sure&nbsp; the Conde would not&nbsp; like the look he planned for&nbsp; her&nbsp; ruined.

Annika then told Helena that she had no time for a shower since the Conde was expecting her already. Annika then took hold of both of Helena&#8217;s arms and pulled her up from the lounger. Once Helena was on her feet, the other girl with Annika took hold of one of Helena&#8217;s hands and she was marched in between the two women towards the party..

As she was being pulled along between the two girls, Helea noticed for the first time that Annika had apparently changed for the party. Like the girl with her, Annika was in some sort of sailing outfit complete with wind breaker and top sider shoes. When asked why she was dressed so, Annika told her that the theme of the party involved&nbsp; sailing or yachting, so everybody would come dressed accordingly. She also revealed to Helena, that in her case, the Conde wanted her to come as a sunbather, body all sweaty and glistening with oil, which surely would make her the toast of the party.

While being so led, Helena could not help but notice the difference in sound the slip-slapping of her bare feet made on the cold granite floors, as compared to the squeaks of the other girl&#8217;s rubber soled shoes. She could also not help but pray there would be others dressed in swimsuits too, so she would not be the only one feeling undressed and&nbsp;&nbsp; out of place.

Alas, it was not to be.

 To Helena&#8217;s utter dismay none of the other guests were even remotely in swimsuits. In fact as she scanned the twenty five guests scattered around the huge ball room, comprising of ten men and fifteen women, every one of them were stylishly garbed from neck to foot, in the latest of nautical fashion. Helena could not help but despair at how&nbsp; inappropriately (un)dressed&nbsp; she was&nbsp; as she was escorted into the room.

Helena was in a daze as she was being circulated around the room to meet the guests. She recognized most of the men as friends and associates of the Conde and kept her eyes downcast in shame, as she tried to avoid any eye contact with them whatsoever. She did feel their ravenous and lust filled stares roving all over her all but nude body, which made her involuntarily cringe as she made her rounds.

 As for the fifteen women in attendance, she recognized some of them as the girlfriends of some of the men present, while the rest were all strangers to her. To a woman though, except possibly for Annika, none of&nbsp; the other women appeared&nbsp; even remotely friendly towards Helena. Some acknowledged and eyed her indifference when introduced; while most of them just stared back at her in silence with&nbsp; a most distasteful and utterly contemptuous look on their face.

Helena finally caught sight of the Conde standing at the far side of the room, talking to a slender brunette dressed all in black, whose back was turned. He was wearing his commodore outfit, complete with admiral&#8217;s cap. Before Helena could call out to the Conde, he fixed her with a smile and&nbsp; signaled over to Annika to bring her over.

With her heart fluttering at the sight of her man so virile and handsome standing&nbsp; so close by, Helena&nbsp; was just about to break free from her escorts and rush pell-mell over to his waiting arms when the Conde did the must unexpected thing. He leaned towards the woman he was talking to and gave her a long and lingering kiss on the lips. 

Taken aback by the Conde was doing, Helena stopped on her tracks and stared at him in disbelief. She&nbsp; had to be virtually dragged the next few feet before she finally stood before the Conde and the woman he was kissing. The Conde looked at her with a mischievous gleam in his eyes, as he broke the kiss to whisper something in the other woman&#8217;s ear.

As the room grew silent in anticipation, the woman in black slowly turned around to face Helena.

�Hola, Helena its been quite a while,&nbsp; si? � The woman in black said to Helena with the phoniest of smiles. � I hope you still remember me, because&nbsp; I have never forgotten about you in all these years.�

If Helena was shocked to silence after seeing her lover kiss another woman, she was now petrified with fear upon realizing who the other woman was.

�Luisa?� . . .Helena tentatively whispered, desperately hoping that was mistaken.

�Si.� Luisa answered back. �I am Luisa, your former colleague and best friend. . . The girl whose confidence you broke all those years before. . . The girl whose life you&nbsp; screwed over for the sake of a promotion.�

Helena just hung her head in shame as a litany of her sins were being thrown to her face by the aggrieved party. She tried to block off all of Luisa&#8217;s righteous indignation from her consciousness, that Helena almost did not get the last of Luisa&#8217;s admonition. 

�The girl whose lover you tried to steal�. . .

Caught by surprise by Luisa&#8217;s last statement, Helena looked up to her to protest her innocence. However, before she could even open her mouth, Luisa threw her drink at Helena&#8217;s face, catching her mostly in the eyes.

Temporarily blinded by the sting to her eyes, Helena failed to see Luisa charge at her and grab onto her hair with both her hands.

�Hija de puta!!!� Luisa screamed. �I&#8217;ll teach you for messing up my life.� Luisa continued as she savagely yanked&nbsp; on Helena&#8217;s hair, shaking her brains thoroughly.

Despite having had her hands released as soon as Luisa&#8217;s drink was thrown to her face, Helena did little to protect herself as her hands flew up to try and break Luisa&#8217;s hold on her hair, to no avail. It was only then that Helena tried mounting an offensive of her own by latching onto Luisa&#8217;s hair also and a hair pulling match began.

Meanwhile, the crowd gathered around the combatants to get a better view of the fight. Everyone cheered as the woman in the black hoodie and tight long black
pants gave a vicious tug to the other woman&#8217;s hair. While everyone jeered as the woman in the bikini screamed out in pain.&nbsp; From the crowd&#8217;s reaction you could very well tell that everybody was rooting for Luisa and none at all were for Helena.

The girls got their feet entangled while pulling at each other&#8217;s hair, causing them to both fall to the ground. This did not, however, cause them to lose their grips on the other&#8217;s hair as they continued to battle, while rolling all over the floor. 

At one point in the fight, Luisa found herself lying on top of Helena. She was able to extricate one of her hands from the other&#8217;s hair and used it to slap, punch or otherwise beat the other girl all over her head and face. Helena could only scream with pain at this new assault, as her plea for the Conde to save her seems to have fallen on deaf ears. In fact, the Conde was immensely enjoying the match and would not have, or allowed any one else to interfere. 

Due to the beating she was getting Helena was forced to let go of Luisa&#8217;s hair and tried to use both her hands to cover up with. This allowed Luisa to now straddle her clearly outclassed opponent, in a school girl pin ,and pitilessly&nbsp; beat down on Helena&nbsp; with both fists blazing, to the raucous cheers of the appreciative audience. The Conde included.

Luisa had Helena helpless and in tears when she decided to humiliate her further. With a most evil smile, Luisa ripped off Helena&#8217;s bikini top. As Helena&#8217;s naked breasts were unceremoniously exposed to the world, the room filled to a cacophony of cruel taunts and shrill wolf whistles, as the crowd feasted on Helena&#8217;s once hidden delights. 

This encouraged Luisa to pay special attention to Helena&#8217;s breasts and she spent the next ten minutes or so principally&nbsp; attacking them. She sadistically pinched them all over and pulled and twisted on each nipple as far as they would go. She slapped them to and fro, making them look like a pendulum. And, she even used them as punching bags, alternatively driving her fists into them.

As a result of all this special attention, Helena was reduced to a sweaty lump of quivering flesh begging and crying for mercy. This was not to be.

Getting a bit bored of the torture she was inflicting, Luisa came up with an idea which she thought would be so much&nbsp; fun. She grabbed Helena by her hair with one hand and painfully dragged her&nbsp; to her feet by the hair. She thereupon got behind Helena and put her in a full nelson. Once she had the poor woman&#8217;s nakedness helplessly put on display, that is except for her remaining bikini bottoms, Luisa led Helena towards the encircling audience, inviting them all to join in the fun. They all obliged.

Of the two sexes, It was the women in the group who proved the most brutal. While the men mostly contented themselves in twisting Helena&#8217;s tits a bit, the women went way beyond. Like sharks on a feeding frenzy, the women attacked Helena as a group, slapping and punching her all over her face and upper body. Some even latched their claws on to her swollen breasts and sadistically dug into their soft flesh. It was a miracle that Luisa was able to keep her hold on Helena who all the while was yelping out in pain and begging for mercy.

� AAYIEE. . .ENOUGH PLEASE ! ! ! . . . NO MORE POR FAVOR! ! !�

Unfortunately for the poor Helena, the more strident her please for mercy grew, the more rabid the women became in torturing her helpless body.

After a minute of having the women enjoy Helena&#8217;s company, Luisa moved her along to come face to face with the Conde, who was calmly sitting on a chair. Helena was fervently pleading with him for help as she was being presented to him, but instead of saving his paramour, the Conde eyed her with a wry smile and tweaked both her nipples.

Although what the Conde did was not the most painful of punishment she received by far, to Helena this was the cruelest blow yet, since it was dealt by the man she&nbsp; loved. She just broke down and cried as she was led away, but not before she was made to witness the Conde&#8217;s face break into a huge grin when he saw her tears start to flow.

After her stint with the Conde, Helena was then brought back before Annika. Luisa said something to her in Swedish and the tall beautiful blond woman sexily sashayed over towards Helena.

When she was face to face with Helena, she gently put her hands on her and started to massage away the pain from her aching flesh. She also planted little kisses on Helena&#8217;s lips and neck while running her hands all over her naked flesh.

As the all but naked Helena stood sandwiched between the two fully clothed women, her traitorous body slowly began to respond to Annika&#8217;s expert ministrations. She gave out an involuntary moan when the beautiful Swede deeply kissed her on the neck, and her hips started to undulate as the circles Annika&#8217;s probing fingers were making were getting closer and closer to her crotch.

When Annika&#8217;s hand reached its destination, she gently massaged Helena&#8217;s&nbsp; pussy through the cloth of her bikini bottoms, before suddenly wrenching the last remaining covering Helena had on her body. Helena was now utterly and totally naked. This however did not elicit the usual raucous reaction from the crowd, who just stood there in silence, absolutely mesmerized by the show taking place before them.

After she had bared Helena nude, Annika contemptuously discarded what remained of Helena&#8217;s bottoms, and started caressing the other woman&#8217;s glistening slit. At this point Luisa let go of Helena and stepped back, leaving the now compliant nude to the expert and loving hands of Annika.

Annika helped Helena to the floor and started kissing and loving her all over. She stuck a finger into her pussy and rhythmically sawed it in and out, causing the naked woman to purr out in ecstasy. Once she had the other woman going, Annika added more and more fingers into Helena. She had already gotten four into her and was just about to add a fifth, planning&nbsp; to fist the naked beauty beneath her,&nbsp; when Helena c ame to an explosive climax.

While Helena was being made to cumm&nbsp; in public, Luisa went over to the Conde and asked&nbsp; something from him. He readily agreed and removed his belt, handing it over to Luisa. It was an Armani belt and it was a gift from Helena. Menacingly, Luisa approached the bucking naked form of Helena on the floor who, was just on the verge of cumming.

As soon as Helena started cumming, Luisa brought the belt down hard on Helena&#8217;s breasts. Helena&#8217;s eyes batted wide open in shock and pain at this new assault, as Luisa rained blow after blow on her with the belt, intent on denying the naked woman&nbsp; the afterglow of her climax.

As soon as Luisa resumed her attack, the crowd erupted back to life as they cheered on Luisa as she continued to whip Helena with the belt. Annika meanwhile busied herself wiping her hands with the remnants of Helena&#8217;s bikini.

Helena tried scampering away to escape Luisa&#8217;s wrath but the crowd just got in her way. She got tripped by one of the women, and fell down allowing Luisa to catch her and flog and kick her all over without mercy. Unable to escape the punishment meted to her, Helena got into a fetal position, and remained that way until she mercifully passed out from the pain.

When Helena came to, she found Luisa seated on a chair in front of her with her legs demurely crossed. Seeing that Helena had finally awoken, Luisa straightened up and imperiously addressed her.

�So, you are awake, cono. Are you ready to do all that I say? Or would you prefer some more of this?� Luisa raised the belt she had earlier used to chastise Helena with, which the other woman immediately recognized as her gift to the Conde.

In total fear, Helena immediately agreed to do whatever Luisa said. She also stole a glance towards the Conde and looked with sadness as he looked back at her with the widest grin ever.

�Bueno� Luisa said and she motioned for Annika over.

Annika brought with her a stack of papers which she then dropped on the floor beside Helena. Helena was then told to sign them, and did so without even bothering to read them when a pen was handed to her. Wiping away her tears with her left&nbsp; hand, she used her right to busily write out her signature. 

When the papers were all signed and were taken away by Annika, Luisa commanded Helena to get up on her knees and sit back on her crossed feet. She had a tale to tell and wanted Helena&#8217;s full attention.

To Helena&#8217;s mounting discomfort, Luisa told her that she had found a way of embezzling billions of pesetas from Helena&#8217;s bank, but the papers she had signed would point to Helena as the culprit. The money of course would end up in Luisa&#8217;s secret Swiss account as compensation for the humiliation she underwent at the hands of the bank Chairman&#8217;s daughter&#8217;s .

�Of course,� Luisa chillingly added matter of factly � the Chairman would have to resign in disgrace for such huge a loss, and most likely shoot himself.� 

Luisa also told Helena that she had just signed over authorities allowing the closing of all her accounts as well as the selling off of all her possessions, the proceeds of which would again find itself in Luisa&#8217;s account, again as recompense, this time&nbsp; for Helena&#8217;s crimes against her.

�So you see chika, after today, you have nothing. . . nada. . . all you have will be&nbsp; mine now. . . and soon, you will not even own the clothes on your back.� Luisa evilly gloated at the naked woman cowering at her feet. Helena could only look back up at her, in horror and despair.

After allowing Helena time to digest the direness of her future, Luisa called out to her to lay on her lap. Like a zombie, the naked woman crawled towards the clothed Luisa and settled herself gingerly on her lap, with her hands and legs outstretched on opposite sides of Luisa, and with her ass the highest part of her body. 

Everybody was expecting Luisa to give Helena&#8217;s ass a well deserved spanking. However, instead of an immediate&nbsp; spanking, the expectant audience watched as Luisa merely playfully rubbed Helena&#8217;s ass, while the Conde&nbsp; made his way towards them.

When the Conde stood before them, he gave both women his most dazzling smile. He then genuflected and took out what appeared to be a Bulgari ring box and presented the ring not to Helena, but to Luisa, together with a proposal for marriage.

�NO . . . El Conde. . NO. . . WHY ARE YOU GIVING HER MY RING! ! !� Helena cried out in dismay.

This elicited a sharp and loud slap on her ass from Luisa, which echoed through the silent room.

�Your ring? What makes you think the Conde would ever give a low class puta like you a ring, cono?� Luisa asked.

�But the ring has my initials H.M. engraved at the back!� Helena insisted.

�Ah, the initials H.M. You thought them to mean Helena Martin, did you not pendeja?
For your information my full name is Helois Margaux Lavalin y Sevilla. My father was French and I stopped using my full name&nbsp; when he divorced my mother and returned to France. I hispanized my name and adopted my mother&#8217;s surname as my own, so I became Luisa Sevilla. � Luisa explained.

�However, my boyfriend Tony, insists on calling me Helois, saying it sounds more classy. So you see puta the initials H.M. does not refer to you at all. They stand for Helois Margaux and the J.A refers my boyfriend Tony, Juan Antonio.�

As tears overflowed from Helena&#8217;s eyes, El Conde lovingly put the ring on Helois&#8217;s finger. It was a perfect fit. With&nbsp; the ring now snug in her finger Helois started wailing at Helena&#8217;s naked ass.

Blow after blow Luisa&#8217;s&nbsp; be-ringed hand landed on Helena&#8217;s doomed posterior, as she kicked her feet helplessly in the air and wiggled her butt around, to try and escape the cruel blows administered to her.. Her boobs too were bobbing about obscenely on the other side, as Helena cried out, not only in pain, but&nbsp; in sorrow as well.&nbsp; for her lost love. The crowd mercilessly jeered Helena as she cried out and even began clapping and counting along the number of spanks she had received so far.

Finally after around fifty hard spanks which turned Helena&#8217;s bronzed ass red as a beet, Luisa pushed her from her lap down to the floor where she allowed the bawling Helena to cry her heart out for her misfortune.

When Helena was able to compose herself, she found the room empty except for Annika and three other women. When Annika saw Helena was no longer in hysterics, she grabbed Helena by the hair and pulled her to her feet. She thereupon promptly marched the naked woman out of the room from behind, with the three other girls strolling behind, enjoying the view of Helena&#8217;s naked red ass as it swished from left to right. 

Annika led Helena up to her room, where she was told to repack. Thinking that her ordeal was finally over and that she would be allowed to leave, Helena quickly repacked all her stuff, except for the outfit she would wear during her departure. However, when Annika told her to pack them as well, a sinking feeling started to come over Helena, that her travails would not be over yet.

Having packed everything, Helena was told to carry all her bags down. The four girls with her offered to help out by carrying Helena&#8217;s small shoulder bag, leaving Helena the two big luggage to manage on her own.

Helena just managed to lug around her bags, helped no doubt by the incessant prodding of her four escorts, one of whom was overly burdened with her shoulder bag. However, instead of showing her to the front door, she was led to the back of the villa to an open air mini Greek mini-amphitheater, complete with tiered marble seats arranged in a semi-circle. There she found the rest of the party goers comfortably seated with Helois and the Conde, in the place of honor. There was a bonfire roaring in the middle of the stage.

When Helena came into view she was told by Helois to get on all fours in front of her like a dog. She was told, that since the money that would be raised from the sale of her property would not be enough to compensate for what Helois underwent, she would now have to auction off all her personal stuff, with the money of course going to Helois.

Helois also told her that should anything remains unsold, it would immediately go to the fire. With no other choice available, Helena just weakly nodded her head in assent.

The auction of Helena&#8217;s clothes was quite lively and festive. The bidders particularly enjoyed having the naked Helena pick up items of her clothing one at a time for display, only to have them either handed over to its new owner, or burned to a crisp, lost forever in the fire. 

 There were spirited bids on Helena&#8217;s jewelry and some of her clothes and shoes, the winning bids, more often than not, were mere pittances of what they were actually worth. The&nbsp;&nbsp; vast majority of Helena&#8217;s clothes made its way to the fire, though since the bidders seemed to enjoy the look of anguish on Helena&#8217;s face every time&nbsp; she was made to burn her clothing on her own.

Finally after the last item in her luggage, as well as the bags themselves were either sold&nbsp; or&nbsp; thrown to the fire, leaving Helena nothing whatsoever to wear for her journey home, the Conde signaled to one of his uniformed servants. A number of them came out bearing more bags which they placed beside the naked Helena, opened.

 Looking inside the bags, Helena found all her personal belongings in the world, every piece of clothing, shoes&nbsp; and accessories she owned, her photo albums and diary, her personal memorabilia, in fact everything she owned were in those bags.

When Helena gave Helois a puzzled look, the other woman smugly told her that she had had all of Helena&#8217;s stuff gathered and brought here. She then asked the party guests whether they would like to bid on this lot or have Helena just throw them to the fire. It was unanimous, everyone wanted them consigned to the fire and eagerly awaited Helena to do so.

When she hesitated a bit, Helena was immediately threatened with the belt. Again, faced with no other choice, Helena got on with the task of destroying everything she owned, truly leaving her with absolutely nothing, not even the clothes off her back.

When Helena was done with the destruction, Helois once again ordered her to her knees. Once Helena got into position, Helois told her that now they were even and that she may go. Helois then asked Annika to escort the naked Helena out.

Realizing that she was about to be thrown out naked to the world, framed for a monumental crime she did not even commit&nbsp; and without a thing in the world to call her own, Helena did the only option available to her. She groveled at Helois&#8217;s feet, piteously begging for her to stay. Helena even offered herself as a slave, so long as she be allowed to remain.

From Helois&#8217;s stoic appearance you would not believe, that inside she was ecstatic and quite excited at this development. Now she had the bitch were she wanted her, and would surely have her pay for all the embarrassment she had to undergo. (Helois was so traumatized at having her nakedness appear in the media, she had to undergo therapy for about a year, just to come to terms with it.)

Helois made Helena fervently beg some more before she agreed to Helena&#8217;s serviture. Rather than have a document drawn up (which would be illegal any way) Helena&#8217;s terms of indenture were dictated to her&nbsp; by her new mistress, as she prostrated herself before her. Helena qas then made to seal the compact&nbsp; by having Helena lick Helois&#8217;s shoes all over, including the soles.

Also, to remind the new slave of her new station in life, Helois&nbsp; had the Conde pull out a cheap ring box from his pocket. Inside was a cheap copper band which Helois jammed in Helena&#8217;s ring finger, sarcastically telling her that this is the ring she deserves and the only piece of clothing she will ever wear from now on. Helena broke into tears as she read what was inscribed on the ring.

What followed next was a night of pure orgiastic debauchery for the new slave. After everybody returned to the ball room, El Conde and Helois made her a gift to the rest of the party goers. To do with as they please.

To start off, she was given over to the nine men. She was g to the nine men at the party to fuck with as they please. She was fucked singly, in pairs or in any other combination. Once she had to do all five men at once, one each in her mouth, pussy and ass, while two were being given hand jobs.&nbsp; 

 None of her holes were left un-violated by the sex hungry men who were greatly aroused by the endless humiliation Helena had been forced to undergo, thus far. The men ended their abuse of Helena by giving her a bukkake shower, with&nbsp; all the&nbsp; nine of them stood in a circle around the kneeling Helena,&nbsp; and bathed her with all their semen&nbsp; all over her face and hair.

Following the men,, it was the women&#8217;s turn to amuse themselves with Helena. They had Helena eat each and every one of 
 them out while she was being fucked by a wine bottle at the same time. Round and round Helena went licking the pussies of every woman at the party, almost gagging as female cum flooded her tongue. After Helena was able to complete her task, Annika approached her and, and with a smile, told her that it was now time for her reward. However, instead of the gentle caresses Annika had dispensed with earlier, she took a second wine bottle and fucked Helena in the ass with it, at the same time her pussy was being fucked by another wine bottle.

Helena collapsed in exhaustion (or pain) to the rhythm of the two wine bottles fucking her.

The next day, the Conde and Helois were married in civil ceremonies by the Mayor of Ibiza. There was&nbsp; a much grander church wedding planned&nbsp; in the cathedral of Madrid when the couple get back from their honey moon, consisting of a world tour on their yacht.

&nbsp; The marriage took place in the same ball room were the night before Helena met her ordeal. There were a lot more people in attendance, including family and relatives of the bride and groom. Also in attendance, but hidden from the other&#8217;s view behind a partially drawn curtain, was a lone naked woman chained to the pillars with a ball gag in her mouth. She witnessed the whole ceremony and&nbsp; even wept copious tears when the Conde and Helois were declared man and wife.

Helena was likewise allowed to partake of the wedding banquet, in honor of the bride and groom.&nbsp; Although not actually allowed to be present at the banquet hall, Helena was&nbsp; was allowed&nbsp; a ring side view&nbsp; via closed circuit television, as she knelt naked and on all fours before a specially hooked up tv monitor, in the wine cellar of the villa. Also, when the sumptuous feast was served Helena was made sure to share in the blessings by having a dish of dog food served to her, which naturally she would have to eat like a dog. As for wine, Helena was given a bowl of tap water which suspiciously smelled and tasted like urine. Helois had a camera trained on Helena the whole time, to ensure she gobbles up her food and drink properly, otherwise there would be hell to pay.

When the cake was cut, Helena was allowed a small piece also. Unlike the ones served the guests, Helena&#8217;s slice was decorated by the word PUTA on it.

Even during the couple&#8217;s first night, the naked Helena was not forgotten. After consummating their marriage, the Conde and Condesa had Helena brought to their suite, were they&nbsp; consummated their absolute and complete&nbsp; domination of her. The Condesa&nbsp; made the servile wretch eat her out thoroughly and give her ass a total rim job, while the Conde fucked Helena in the ass. Later after&nbsp; the Condesa came , the happy couple exchanged places and now it was the Conde&#8217;s cock that&nbsp; Helena was sucking, straight from her ass; while the Condesa was now fucking her ass with a strap on dildo, which was a lot bigger than even the Conde&#8217;s&nbsp; well endowed member. Poor Helena had to lick the humungous dildo clean as a whistle before she got kicked to the floor, and sleep there.

 After the wedding, the Conde and Condesa got underway for their world tour in their yacht. As they stood side by side happily waving to friends and well wishers, they were joined by Annika, who was the Condesa&#8217;s best friend, long time confidante and now major domma to her household.

Likewise joining them, but kept out of sight crouched inside a specially made dog cage somewhere within the holds of the ship,&nbsp; was a weeping, naked woman wearing&nbsp; a cheap copper band&nbsp; on her finger which had the words � HELENA LA CONDESA DELA PERRA� (Helena The countess&#8217;s bitch) stenciled on it.

We regret to say, whatever life may hold for our poor Helena in the future, it would surely be one not even the Marquis de Sade would wish upon his most hated enemies.&nbsp;&nbsp;
