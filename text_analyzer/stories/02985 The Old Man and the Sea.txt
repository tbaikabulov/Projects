Synopsis: An old man vanquishes three wicked mermaids.THE OLD MAN AND THE SEA  
By C  
 Once a small village along the great Southern Sea was afflicted by an especially
  cruel, lustful tribe of mermaids. They were beautiful, with luxuriant blond
  hair, full round breasts, and slender waists. Their skin was pale, nearly the
  color of snow. The human (somewhat human) half ended in a gently swelling,
  hairless mons  , broached by a little cleft that made
  a rosy contrast to the white skin surrounding it. Farther down, they had the
  tails of dolphins, with powerful flukes that drove them through the water at
  great speed, when needed.  
 Beautiful they were, but each had an ugly cinder for a heart. Their chief
  delight was seduction, followed by murder. They began at night, luring young
  men (or young women) into the water to be drowned. Soon, they grew so bold
  that they attacked during the day, and the fishing and whaling on which the
  village depended for its life grew impossibly perilous.  
 Then came the final outrage. One day, shortly before noon, as the villagers
  were preparing for their siesta, thirty or forty mermaids appeared in the water,
  just yards from the huts. They bobbed there, smiling and waving, their faces
  full of cruel mirth. Three young men headed for the water. The other villagers
  tried to stop them, but discovered that their feet were rooted in place. All
  they could do was stand and watch in helpless horror. The men entered the sea,
  swam out to the beckoning women, and were then pulled beneath the surface.
  Their bodies were never found.  
 An old man, a retired fisherman and whaler, saw all this from the wharf.
  He cursed his helplessness, and he resolved that, however he had to do it,
  he would bring at least some of these wicked sirens to justice. He knew that
  mermaids were dangerous adversaries, and he blessed what he once had thought
  a great misfortune: he had absolutely nothing to lose. (He had no children,
  and his wife had died years before.)  
 As soon as the spell of immobility had passed, he hiked inland to the hill
  country, where a wise woman, reputed to be a great sorceress, dwelt alone.
  When he got to her hut, she welcomed him in and let him explain the little
  that he knew.  
 &quot;I have nothing to pay you,&quot; he said. &quot;Tell me where I can
  go to hire myself out and I will; then I'll come back with money.&quot;  
 She laughed at this. &quot;I get all my food from your village, or from
  the farmers who live near it. If you perish, the farmers will perish, and so
  will I. It would be unseemly, and unwise, not to help you if I can.&quot;  
 She then got down to business. &quot;Now, if I remember everything you've
  told me correctly, I know very well the mermaid coven that's descended upon
  you. Here's the bad news: they'll batten on your village till they've sucked
  the life out of it. Now for the good news: they're not invulnerable.&quot; She
  started to rummage through her supplies. &quot;In  
fact . . . I have somewhere . . . here it is!&quot; She pulled out a great
  length of what looked like fishing line. At one end, it branched into three
  lines, each tied to a silver hook. She laid this on the floor in front of the
  old man.  
 &quot;They are ruled by three sisters, the wickedest of the lot. Your only
  hope is to capture all three, and then their followers should be no problem.
  This line can do it. Tie one end down securely (and I mean securely!) and cast
  the other into the water. With a little luck, it'll snag all three in a place
  they don't like to be snagged! If you catch them, be prepared for a fight:
  when they're hooked, they'll have some vulnerability to weapons, but the only
  way to subdue them completely is to tie their wrists behind them. I guarantee
  it'll be hard work. Now, if  you catch them, and if  you
  bind them, they'll use every wile they have to escape. They'll offer you three
  wishes for anything at all you desire, in return for a promise to let them
  go. If you make that promise, and don't honor it, you and your village will
  be blasted from the face of the earth. Need I say that mermaid wishes are always
  dangerous? Since you want them dead, it's hard to see why you'd go the wish
  route.&quot; She told him a few more things he needed to know; then he prepared
  to leave.  
 &quot;I'm grateful for all your help,&quot; he said as he picked up the
  magic line and carefully placed it in his knapsack. &quot;But how do I bait
  these hooks?&quot;  
 The woman's face was grim. &quot;With a human life,&quot; she said. &quot;Nothing
  else will draw them. Good luck.&quot;  
 He thought long and hard on her words as he trudged back to the village.
  By the time he got home, he had the beginnings of a plan.  
 As soon as he'd worked out the details, he went down to the water, to a
  place where they were known to congregate, and where they'd taken at least
  four victims. It was about midday. He brought with him several lengths of rope,
  a small harpoon from his whaling days, and, of course, the magic fishing line.
  When he got there, he tied the line as securely as he could to an old tree
  stump. He then tossed the business end into the water. Now he waited.  
 In what seemed like no time at all, three particularly beautiful mermaids
  appeared in the water in front of him, about thirty yards away. &quot;Hello,
  old man!&quot; one of them shouted. &quot;Would you like to die today?&quot;  
 &quot;To be honest with you, yes I would,&quot; he said. &quot;I have nothing
  to live for any longer. My village was all that mattered to me, and it's obvious
  that you, with your irresistible magic, will soon destroy it.&quot;  
 &quot;You're right about that,&quot; said another. &quot;'Out of your league'
  would be an understatement in these circumstances.&quot; As they mocked him,
  the tide carried them nearer.  
 &quot;So kill me then,&quot; he said, and came as close to the water as
  he could without going in.  
 &quot;OK, but you're going to have to come in,&quot; said the third.  
 &quot;Could I get a closer look at you first? You're all very beautiful.&quot;  
 &quot;Why thank you!&quot; said the first one. &quot;You have a good, long
  look.&quot; With this, they swam to within a few yards of him and raised themselves
  as far out of the water as they could. They were breathtaking. The sun made
  their hair look like gold fire. Their breasts stood at proud attention, the
  pink nipples erect with bloodthirsty lust. He could see their clefts. (Was
  he imagining a pleasantly musky scent coming to him over the water from this
  source?)  
 &quot;Feast your eyes,&quot; said the first mermaid, and then her expression
  changed. Where there had been malicious pleasure, now there was a look of pained
  perplexity. &quot;Ow!" she cried, "What in the seven circles of . . . ?&quot; She
  looked down, and he looked with her, and at just the same time both realized
  what they were seeing: a big silver hook, firmly embedded now in one of the
  lips of her cunt.  
 She clutched at her groin, threw back her head, and screamed, a long wail
  of hurt and humiliation. Just then, her sisters, not knowing what was happening,
  were snagged as well, in exactly the same way. Two more high, hurt-filled screams,
  and then all three disappeared below the surface.  
 Now it was time to sweat. The wise woman had explained that when the hooks
  found their resting places, the victims would be unable to remove them, because
  the metal magically curved in on itself. But these were still powerful swimmers,
  and within moments the line that held them was stretched to its limit. Would
  it hold? The old man had no idea. Instead of worrying about that, he ran to
  the tree stump and wrapped length after length of the line around it. His quarry
  fought him for every inch. He thought at one point he might collapse from exhaustion,
  but he took a deep breath and just kept at it, drawing the wicked trio slowly
  but inexorably in.  
 Luckily, they were tiring. After several minutes, he actually had them out
  of the water, thrashing madly, smacking the sand with their powerful tails.
  He pulled them up onto a dry spot (he guessed that they drew much of their
  power from water), then ran up with the harpoon. They shrieked and yelped as
  he jabbed them in their breasts, their bellies, their rumps, their tails. &quot;Let
  me tie you, and I'll stop!&quot; he yelled. At first they screamed defiantly
  at him and kept on fighting, but, before much longer, fatigue gained the upper
  hand. At last they submitted, with surprising meekness, trembling and weeping
  as he bound them.  
 He lined them up, still crying, retreated to a safe distance, and tried
  to regain his breath. Every now and then, a tail would thwack the sand explosively,
  but that was about it. When he'd recovered somewhat, he came back and admired
  his catch. Even though they were less than half-human, they were the most beautiful
  women he had ever seen. Gazing at them, he felt both pity and desire, both
  of which he struggled hard to suppress.  
 The first mermaid had regained some of her self-possession. She glared at
  him with proud contempt and said: &quot;Well, what do you plan to do with us?&quot;  
 &quot;I thought I might kill you . . . .&quot;  
 &quot;Easily said!&quot; she sneered.  
 &quot;But I have another idea. If the stories I've heard are true, you may
  have three things I want.&quot;  
 The mermaids now smiled, and it wasn't nice to see. &quot;These three things,&quot; said
  the first one, &quot;might they be wishes?&quot;  
 &quot;That's it. Can you help me out there?&quot;  
 She laughed: &quot;Yes, I think we can help. It goes like this: you can
  have anything: gold, a crown, beautiful women, even immortality. But you must
  first swear an oath to release us unharmed. You'll swear on the true name of
  the Dark Master whom we serve. That's the most terrible oath of all. Break
  it, and your village, your life, and your soul will be forfeit.&quot;  
 &quot;Sounds good to me,&quot; said the old man. &quot;Show me what to do.&quot;  
 So she took him through the ritual of swearing and revealed to him the Name
  that Should Not Be Spoken. And he swore, and so did they.  
 &quot;By the way,&quot; said the first girl. &quot;My name is Tritonia.
  This is my sister Propontia, and this is our little sister Kiki.&quot;  
 &quot;Pleased to meet you,&quot; he said.  
 &quot;Now,&quot; said Tritonia, &quot;what's wish number one? Do you want
  to start with cash, or lovely ladies, or what?&quot;  
 &quot;All right,&quot; he said. &quot;Here's number one: you and your mermaid
  followers will never again do any harm to my village or its inhabitants.&quot;  
 Tritonia pouted. &quot;That's a downer! But if that's what you really want
  . . . .&quot;  
 &quot;I do.&quot;  
 &quot;Very well,&quot; she said. &quot;I'll handle this one.&quot; She took
  a deep breath and then groaned as if her insides were being churned. &quot;Devil,
  that hurts more than I thought it would! Well, I've given you your wish. I
  hope you're happy.&quot;  
 &quot;I'm starting to be.&quot;  
 &quot;I'll handle the next one,&quot; said Propontia. &quot;What do you
  want now?&quot;  
 &quot;All right,&quot; said the old man, &quot;my second wish: within two
  weeks, you'll hand over every one of your mermaid followers to the villagers
  for punishment.&quot;  
 &quot;What?!&quot; they all shrieked. &quot;Fuck you! Not a chance!&quot; shouted
  the imperious Tritonia.  
 He simply smiled and said: &quot;Didn't we all just swear a terrible oath?
  What'll happen to you if you don't hold up your end?&quot;  
 &quot;He's right Sis,&quot; said Propontia. &quot;We can find new girls,
  though I have to say these were the best.&quot; (Tritonia just scowled and
  ground her teeth.) &quot;Here,&quot; said Propontia, &quot;let me get it over
  with.&quot; She took a breath, then emitted a pain-filled wail. &quot;Oh my,&quot; she
  gasped, &quot;it's like laying a thirty-pound egg! You've got your wish, you
  bastard.&quot;  
 &quot;Thank you.&quot;  
 &quot;My turn now,&quot; said Kiki. Tritonia broke in: &quot;If you want
  a treasure or lovely ladies, here's your last chance.&quot;  
 &quot;Indeed,&quot; said the old man. &quot;I want the prettiest treasure,
  the loveliest ladies I've ever seen. A week from today, at this time precisely,
  I want to catch all three of you again.&quot;  
 For a moment, they just stared at him in horrified shock. Then, in a voice
  of barely controlled hatred and rage, Tritonia hissed: &quot;Have you forgotten,
  old man, that you agreed to let us go without harming us?&quot;  
 &quot;I'm going to let you go without harming you. And next week I'm going
  to catch you again. Either grant my wish or try explaining to your Master how
  you took his name in vain.&quot;  
 Kiki burst into tears. &quot;He's right! He's right! she cried. &quot;The
  prophecy . . . the wise woman warned us we'd be snared by our own magic! She
  warned us . . . .&quot;  
 &quot;Shut up! Shut up, you little tramp!&quot; shouted Tritonia at her
  weeping sister.  
 &quot;No, you shut up!&quot; said Propontia. &quot;It's the truth. We've
  been . . . caught on our own hook!&quot; With this, she dissolved into bitter
  sobs.  
 Tritonia now began to shake. It was all too much for her. Her arrogant facade
  collapsed, the tears gushed down her face, and she wept like the helpless,
  caught fay that she really was.  
 Despite all his efforts, the old man felt pity for the doomed trio. &quot;The
  sooner you grant my last wish,&quot; he said, as kindly as he could, &quot;the
  sooner I can let you go. You want that, don't you?&quot; In response, Kiki
  took a deep breath and screamed as if she were being torn in two. &quot;It's
  done,&quot; she whimpered.  
 He saw that the hooks with which he'd captured them had returned to their
  original shape, so he gently removed them. Then he carried each girl right
  to the water's edge. Next, he cut their bonds with a knife. As they pulled
  themselves painfully into the water, he said: &quot;Don't forget: this time,
  a week from today.&quot; Within seconds, they were gone.  
 Over the next week, no mermaids appeared and no villagers died. Here was
  the first evidence that the old man's plan was working.  
 A full week after the first encounter, he stood on the same shore at about
  midday and cast the silver hooks back into the water. He didn't have long to
  wait. The three mermaids appeared, just thirty or so feet away. Instead of
  flaunting their beauty as they had the week before, they were quiet, subdued.  
 &quot;You came back,&quot; he said. He wasn't entirely sure they would.  
 &quot;Our Master was most displeased with us,&quot; said Tritonia, all the
  belligerence gone from her voice. &quot;If we diverge the slightest bit . .
  . from what we agreed . . . .&quot;  
 &quot;You chose a bad master,&quot; he said. &quot;Well, how do we proceed
  now?&quot;  
 &quot;We won't fight it,&quot; said Propontia.  
 &quot;I still don't trust you. I'll have to hook you again.&quot;  
 &quot;To be sure,&quot; she said, with all the bitterness in the world in
  her voice. Kiki, of course, was crying softly. The tide brought them a little
  closer, closer. All three screamed again when the hooks found them: long, desolate
  wails. They quivered like speared fish, and they wept like little girls, but
  they didn't resist as he drew them in. In just moments, he had them beached.
  When he ran up to bind their wrists, they turned their backs to him to make
  it easier. He then used the magic line to drag them to a meadow behind his
  hut, which was not far away. When he got them there, he slipped out the hooks
  and, for a while, just stood looking at them.  
 Tritonia found her voice again. &quot;You've c-caught us twice. We can never
  harm your people again. Our lieutenants will be washing up on shore over the
  next few days. Surely, oh mighty fisherman, it's time for mercy? If you send
  us to the underworld now, with our Master as displeased as he is . . . .&quot;  
 &quot;I see,&quot; he said. &quot;If some time goes by, you may again become
  his concubines. You don't regret the evil you've done, you regret having been
  caught. And the evil you've done . . . .&quot;  
 &quot;We can serve you!&quot; said Propontia.  
 &quot;And we can give ourselves to you!&quot; said Kiki.  
 His rejoinder was swift: &quot;All out of wishes, then? I'm sorry, ladies.
  I'm only human and I'd love to have you. But even if you can't hurt me and
  mine anymore, you'd have to hurt someone else. I see now that it's just your
  nature. During my talk with the wise woman, she spelled out for me that you're
  creatures of both water and land, and nearly unkillable when in contact with
  either. So . . . .&quot; He got three lines of heavy rope, each ending in a
  noose, and cinched them around the girls' necks.  
 &quot;No! No! No!&quot; they cried, then fell into incoherent sobs. He threw
  the ropes over the strong bough of a tree at the edge of the meadow. When he'd
  hoisted the fays up so that they couldn't touch the ground, he tied the ropes
  to a post he'd installed for just this purpose.  
 They thrashed their tails, their big breasts heaved, the tears poured down
  their faces. When at last it was over, he saw that a thick, clear liquid with
  the aroma of honey was dripping down from each cleft. &quot;The sweet death,&quot; he
  said. The wise woman had told him of this, too.  
 The sisters were true to their word. Over the next week, dozens of mermaids
  were beached on the shores around the village. They clearly didn't want to
  leave the sea, but the sea would no longer have them. On advice from the old
  man, the villagers hung these ladies, either by the neck or by the tail. In
  the latter case, they finished them off with harpoons.  
 The old man took the magic hooks and line back to the wise woman. A few
  months later, they were married.
