&nbsp;

&nbsp;

She stepped into
her spacious bathroom, hearing her heels click on the gleaming marble floor
with a delightful echo.� The water was
gushing out of the glistening taps and just about finished filling the large
claw-footed tub that stood out in the centre of the room, dominating.� This bathroom, her personal one, was the size
of some typical apartments but it suited her�
perfectly and fit into the scale of her sprawling castle
delightfully.� The tall, arched windows rose
up nine feet above the floor, and the flowing sheers billowed lightly with a
gentle breeze.

&nbsp;

She drew down the
zipper of her fitted leather top, exposing her flawless porcelain flesh and her
firm breasts, smiling softly to herself as she ran a fingertip across a crease
that her top had left imprinted in her skin.�
She hung the top on the wooden valet that stood beside the screened
dressing area.� The zipper on her skirt
was a slightly harder tug, as it drew the lightly elasticized fabric tightly to
her sculpted derri�re. She lay the skirt aside as well, and sat on the antique wooden
chair roll to unclasp her garters and roll the vintage silk stockings down her
legs.� 

&nbsp;

She strode to the
tub, swung her petite frame gracefully over the edge, and let herself slowly
sink into the steaming water and mound of bubbles.� She felt the water wash and flow over her,
drawing her into a separate world of relaxation.� As she lay her head back against the molded
pillow fitted to the end of the tub, her eyes closed and she let out a soft
purr of a moan.

&nbsp;

Her day, while
having been supremely satisfying, had been a tiring one, and her respite was
well-deserved. Perhaps it had been a slightly more trying day for her slave,
but that was to be expected, the thought, as her lips curled into a silent
smile.� In the quiet, with only the soft
rustle of the breeze and song of an occasional bird, she could let the
experiences and memories of her day float over her, reliving them in
toe-curling detail. 

&nbsp;

She let each
individual highlight have its own spotlight in her mind�s eye: the first look
on his face when she made him strip completely as he stood only steps inside
her doorway, watching him struggle into the stockings and garters, his groans
as she tightened the corset around his waist, pulling and pulling the laces,
the blush on his face as she stuffed his bra with the breast forms, then
watching him fight to wiggled his entire body into the form-fitting rubber
dress, the way his lips stretched around the ball gag, the way that same gag
made his groans a gurgling blubber when she bent him over and plowed the giant
plug up onto his ass.� She had been so
strict with him, making him clean her entire kitchen, bottom to top, in that
condition.

&nbsp;

Watching each of
these acts had been wonderful and reliving them now in her mind was just as
sweet, especially as she knew his torment was still continuing, for even now,
he was waiting in the torment she had left him in: trapped in a cage that was
little more than an upright tube of cast iron bars, the dildo stuffed inside
his ass mounted to a pole on the floor of the cage, keeping him standing on his
toes on the steel deckplate of the cage�s base, barefoot in his stockings,
drooling and moaning around his gag, his wrists cuffed together in steel
shackles, behind his back.

&nbsp;

She pushed at the
taps with her toes, letting fresh hot water pour into the tub, as she thought
gleefully about his predicament, his humiliation and his transformation from
the normal, if nervous man she met not so long ago.� She could think of him now only as her whore,
her slave, her big-titted slut in shameless clothing, doing any and all of the
shameless things that floated into her mind.�


&nbsp;

There were times
she feared the place that he had carved out in her heart, for she loved him
with a kind of pure burn. She loved the way he moved, both when free and when
laden down with heavy chains.� She loved
the way he talked, when he tried to express his thoughts and dreams, when he
struggled in fear to give honest answers to her interrogations and still avoid
punishments, and even the gurgling mmpphhhs that he forced out around
gags.� She knew, in her love of him, that
he still tried to reject what he was, what she had help make him, and� while that conflict in his mind made his
humiliations all the more powerful, it also made her think he might one day try
to flee from her again.� She could barely
stand the thought of being without him, so she put the unwelcome concept out of
her mind.� After all, if he tried to
leave her his own needs and addiction would bring him back, like a 10 year old
boy who runs away from home, only to come toddling back in time for lunch.� She brought her mind back to him now, as he
was, and smiled widely, even if a question still lingered in her mind: was she
as much his as he was hers?

&nbsp;

She concentrated
on his trials, current and past, and let his embarrassments thrill her even
more, letting her thoughts circling around them.� As she did, she felt as though she could
actually start to imagine his thougths, the reactions of his mind and body,
almost feel the burning redness he must feel on his cheeks when she shames him
before her friends, or in front of strangers. His thoughts, his dreams, his
desires, his deepest needs seemed to wash over her and cover her as completely
as the bathwater.

&nbsp;

Relaxing there
more and more deeply, reclined in the scented water, she could almost
physically feel the tightness of the clothes she put him in, she could almost
feel the cool air up his short skirts, almost feel the boucing of his slutty
fake tits in those low cut tops, and how the latex or leather would just cling
to his body.� She could almost feel the
sensations of helplessness and of being completely controlled that he must feel
when his body was trapped by the cages or bandage she put upon him, or the
internal and external torment from the toys use upon him.

&nbsp;

The link between
their minds was so strong, and she was sure that this was what allowed her to
feel these things almost as if they were happening to her herself, as is she
was standing there in his place, feeling the complete dominance by another
almost overwhelming.� That image, that
experience, that near-perfect link between the two of them, allowing his
thoughts to flow into her like never before, filled her mind as she drifted off
into a light sleep.

&nbsp;

The rich and real
world of her thoughts transformed into dreams, and she saw and felt herself
fully in his place, but with subtle changes she became aware of as she felt her
body squirm.� Instead of being in a small
cage in a darkened basement storage room, she was in the centre of the castle�s
spacious library.� Her wrists were drawn
high over her head, chains from cuffs at her wrists disappearing up to the
ceiling.� Instead of being up on her toes
in bare feet, she felt the tight grip of leather ballet boots holding her feet
pointed in an extreme point.� She wasn�t
balanced atop a dildo pole, but she felt the intrusion of large phallises
inside her pussy and ass, though all she could see of them was the rubber thong
that sealed them inside her.� 

&nbsp;

Just like she
left him, she wore a tightly laced waist cincher, but in place of the full
coverage bra holding his latex breast forms, she wore a demi cut bra
constructed of fine lace and ribbon, barely covering her nipples.� The part of her mind that knew she was
dreaming filled with strange joy as she felt his fantasies almost guiding hers,
as she was able to look down at her own breasts just as cartoonishly large as
his were made, but in this dream hers are completely real, and she felt her
flesh tingle and her nipples stiffen as stray breeze flowed across her
body.� 

&nbsp;

She felt and
tasted the dominating presence of the penis gag in her mouth � it pressed down
on her tongue with the strong smack of both her own pussy and his cum.� It was a taste of submission, and it gave her
a high that she had never felt in that way before.� 

&nbsp;

She squirmed,
pulling at her bonds, not to truly to try to free herself, but rather to feel
their strength, to feel how tightly they held her, to give her body the full
release of being able to throw all she had at them and know they would still
hold her tight.� She felt her body
stretched tight, pulled long and taut, and she felt the sensation of it growing
in her shoulders and her sides.� The
weight that she was able to transfer to the floor made her toes ache with their
enforced posture, and she felt the boots to tight and hot around her feet.

&nbsp;

As the experience
of her position intensified with the passage of time she began to shift her
weight from foot to foot, not only to give her body some relief, but also, she
realized with a blush, because she wanted to feel the rigid toys inside her
move.� She could feel her pussy so wet,
so hot, reacting to everything she was experiencing.� Her thoughts were changing; it wasn�t like in
the tub, where she was aroused by watching him struggle, or imagining him
undergoing these things for her, but she was tingling from the sensations
themselves, the mental experience as well as the physical one.� She could feel the toys up inside her,
teasing her, and she could imagine what she looked like, writhing to feel them
more intensely, but she wanted it, needed it at that moment. 

&nbsp;

She stopped after
a few minutues, with a groan of frustration.�
It wasn�t enough!� She couldn�t
make them move the way she wanted them to, needed them to.� It was exasperating, feeling her arousal grow
and grow until she wanted so badly to bring herself to release, but being held
back by the control of another.� She wanted
just be back in her bath, to feel her fingers freely splay between her thighs,
to bring herself off, but she just couldn�t make herself wake up.� 

&nbsp;

At the same
instant, she realized that her desire to be free wasn�t quite complete.� She wanted to feel this slow rolling boil of
sensation last longer and longer, not wanting it to end just yet.� Even more powerful, more affecting on her
mind, was the realization that it didn�t matter what she wanted.� There didn�t seem to be any way she could
change her situation, her sensations, she was trapped, a captive of these
strange new dreams.

&nbsp;

She leaned her
head back, closing her eyes and letting out a soft moan of pleasure and
frustration and desire, all wrapped up in one.�
In that moment, in that temporary darkness, she felt his touch.� She could tell instantly that it was him, her
slave, even though he had an unfamiliar confidence to his motions. He was
behind her, pressing his body up against hers, grinding his stiffness against
her as he slid his body downwards. Then she feels his hands � had they always
been that strong? � pushing her legs apart. The strain at her arms and
shoulders only increased as her legs were spread, at least two feet apart, but
if he noticed her anguish he didn�t let on, as she only felt this new position
forced upon her by a spreader bar he was locking onto her ankles.

&nbsp;

She let herself
feel it, let the sensations sink in, both painful and the arousing, letting
them mix together. She kept her eyes closed, as his unseen touch now moved up
her body, letting his fingers graze up the insides of her thighs, along her
stocking seams, over her ass, curling over hips, up her sides, curving to her
front, over the tight waist cincher, until he cupped her breasts in her bra
firmly and lovingly, but also with a tangible, inexplicable tone of ownership.
She felt their strange new fullness, the weight of her breast in his grip, and
his kneading made them feel alive in his grip.

&nbsp;

She felt his
fingers slide over her breasts, making her tingle.� Her nipples responded, stiffening the moment
his thumb and forefinger gripped them, and they only grew stiffer and more� sensitized as his pressure increased,
pinching and rolling them, until her eyes jerked open, looking down to see his
fingers closing gleaming steel clover clamps upon them. They stood out stiffer
and farther than she�d ever seen them, poking out over the top of her bra cups,
the clamp device weighing them down and the linking chain swaying in a gentle
arc between her massive new tits.

&nbsp;

The clamps hurt,
shooting a kind of intense shooting pain into her body, but hey also made her
even hotter, and the way her own motion caused the chain to sway and tease her
nipples only made her wetter. There didn�t seem to be words she could put to
this sensation even in her silent thoughts. They hurt, yes, but the buildup of
sensations over her entire body, from her aching feet, her stiffening calves,
the maddening invasions of her ass and pussy, the hugging grip of her waist
cincher, and even the pulsing pain at her nipples and soreness at her
shoulders, they all just seemed to give her the ability to feel everything with
a new intensity, like the volume had been turned up on her nervous system. 

&nbsp;

It made her want
more, just more, more of everything. More pleasure, more pain, more of anything
to feed her growling need. She became aware that she was moaning non-stop
around her gag, and that slick ropes of saliva were trailing down her chin and
making thick drops upon her heaving breasts.

&nbsp;

She got an answer
to her needs, thought it wasn�t the answer she would have chosen. Her moans
were shocked into screams as without warning she felt the cheeks of her ass
explode in near blinding pain. She could tell, in the panting seconds after the
strike, that she was feeling her leather flogger first hand � the way the
leather tails spread and curled around her curves as they slapped at her. She
wasn�t given much time to contemplate that strike, however, as it was quickly
followed with another, and another, and another. He was building up a rhythm,
moving his arm and the flogger in the practiced figure-eight of an expert
tormentor. She was screaming against her gag, her spittle bubbling around it,
and her body jerked in a vain attempt to avoid each landing. Her spasming
motion only served to shake her nipple clamps, increasing that torture as well.

&nbsp;

He was guiding
the strokes carefully, changing his target so slightly each time, so that he
was� reddening her ass and the backs of
her legs completely and evenly. She couldn�t escape, she couldn�t avoid them,
as they rained down over and over, in a seemingly never-ending torment. 

&nbsp;

And then, and
quickly and as wordlessly as it began, it was over. She was panting, her heart
pounding, and she felt as though a fire had been lit under her skin, as though
it must be glowing and visibly throbbing. She slumped down, and could do
nothing but let herself be suspended by her wrist bondage. She was buzzing,
aching, and in disbelief. How could she be dreaming this, feeling this? She
never had dreamed of taking his place before, she had never had the slightest interest
it in, and yet here she was, not only dreaming it, but loving it, and seemingly
trapped in a dream that wasn�t near done with her yet. 

&nbsp;

She wondered, in
a haze, what would it would take to wake up? Was orgasm that much like a little
death? Would it take release to free her from the slavery of these thoughts?

&nbsp;

Her musing was
interrupted by the feeling of the strength of his hand on her body, a body she
only now realized was glistening all over. He had moved a piece of furniture in
front of her; it looked like those pommel horses from gymnastics, and it was
stretched out before her, lengthwise. Her hands were freed from the ceiling,
still cuffed together, but she could lower her arms, which she did with a
gingerly soreness. He took firm hold of her wrists too soon, and pulled her
forwards, so that she was laying down along the horse, and she felt its padded
surface beneath her from her belly to the middle of her chest, which only
pushed her breasts higher upwards, as they squeezed over the end and sides,
with her nipple clamp chain swaying, keeping the sensations of her nipples
fresh and raw.

&nbsp;

He used wide
leather straps in three places to strap her body immovable to the horse, and he
ratcheted them so tight that she though she wasn�t going be able to breathe. He
freed her left wrist from the cuffs, but only long enough to pull her arms up
behind her back, and lock them secure once more.

&nbsp;

She strained to
lift her head, to meet his eyes, but he seemed to move around her with the
shadows as his ally, always just in the dark our out of her sight, shielding
his face and expression from her pleading eyes.

&nbsp;

His motions were
quick and efficient, professional, as if he didn�t want to waste a single
motion or second as he prepared her for what was to come. For her part, she
felt so strange and unsure, feeling his hands move over her now with little
more expression or emotion that he might have had building something out of
wood. She felt cheap, exposed, helpless, frustrated, needy, humiliated � she
was so open, so exposed, hardly dressed and with mouth, cunt and ass stuffed up
with sex toys, while her thighs were wet with dripping need and her drooling
lips felt swollen and hungry. And in this position, this predicament, her
thoughts didn�t even seem her own, as they were telling her body that she loved
it. She craved nothing more that to be this for him, to be his sex toy, to be
placed and used to please him, visually and sensually. Her lust was boiling up
inside her, with a brazen need to cum, but at the same time if he wanted to
just hold her this way so he could look at her, she could wish for nothing
more.

&nbsp;

Watch her he did,
as his hands were suddenly gone from her body, and he was circling her,
watching her flesh strain, pressed between the tight bondage with each breath,
her breasts heaving, her nipples swollen around the cold steel grip of the
clamps, and he pulled down on the chain, only making them bite harder into her.


&nbsp;

He was behind her
once more, dragging his fingertips over the smoldering embers of her assflesh,
he seemed for a moment gentle, but then with a rip and jerk he tore her thong
from her and the integrated dildos were torn from her holes in a wet slurping
double pop. She screamed anew into her gag, with the pain and shame of it. After
wearing them inside her body for so long she felt as if she her holes must be
gaping wide open. 

&nbsp;

And as if testing
that assumption, he was suddenly inside her, driving his thick stiff cock up
into her pussy, slapping his body against her sore ass and testing the strength
of the straps holding her body in place. She felt him drive so deep; she felt
so full and so shamefully wet, knowing he could tell in an instant how much she
needed this. Five thrusts up into her soaked sex were all he took, however,
before he withdrew from her completely, sliding his slick shaft between her ass
cheeks, making her wait, agonize, before he refilled her, this time pushing
against the dildo-stretched rosebud of her ass, lubricated with her own nectar,
and his thrusts were no less deep and full, if only slightly slower, and she
feel his hands gripping her immobilized hips, as he thrust deep, over and over.

&nbsp;

She couldn�t
believe this, she couldn�t comprehend the state she was in. She was taking her
slave up her ass, taking his cock, taking him complete control. This wasn�t a
case of her giving him sex, but rather him taking her, riding her, fucking her
on his own terms, at his own pace and exactly how he wished to, and more than
just taking it or allowing it, she felt more lust and need than she could
remember. Her lust was rising off any chart she could think of. 

&nbsp;

But just as she
was fighting to accept that his warm wet cock in her ass, pumping, seemed just
about to make her cum, he was out of her again. She didn�t stay empty long, as
he clearly prepared for this transition, and twin dildos pushed into her at
once, so thick and deep into her pussy and ass � they were so big, and she felt
the patterns and ribs on their surface, but she was shamefully glad to be
filled up again, even by humiliating toys. And oh god, even as they started to
pump into her on their own, merciless alternating thrusts. Each dildo was
mounted on a steel rod, fixed to rotating wheel powered by an industrial
strength fucking machine, secured behind her, and it spand and ran and drove
the toys into her, slow and deep and non-stop. 

&nbsp;

She had been left
on the edge by his cock, on the precipice of orgasm by his fucking, so she
hoped to her own disgrace that this impersonal machine would grant her the
release she needed with every fibre of her being. But it wasn�t enough � it was
too slow, too methodical � it just made her feel like a whore, on display,
getting the most mortifying kind of fucking she could imagine. 

&nbsp;

At least it was a
dream, at least it was only in her head, at least no one could see her like
this, no one would know, none of them could possibly ever be allowed to know...
She knew as soon as the thought entered her head that she never should have
allowed it.

&nbsp;

She opened her
eyes and struggled to lift her head and look around the spacious room. She him,
her slave, so close, and his delicious cock still wet with her juices, he was
stroking it slowly and firmly while he moved around her. She looked around
more, struggling to see, and her fears were realized, as there, just at the
edge of the shadows, were the two other men. They were men she had allowed to
serve her as slaves; men whom she had sissified and humbled when it pleased
her. Now, even though heavy chains locked to metal collars around their
next� held them away from her, she could
could see that each had is own meat in his hands, jerking off ferociously at
the sight of her debasement.

&nbsp;

Her thoughts were
strange and alien to her once more, even in this horrifying moment, as she
realized that the sight of them, these three slaves now watching her trapped
and fucked, was only making her wetter. Her cherished favorite and these two
servants were clearly aroused, watching her. The sight of her body, her
torment, her use, it was stiffening their cocks, making them breath in quick
jerking gasps. Chained as they were away from her, they had no choice but to
take themselves in their hands, so great was the desire she was inciting in
them. How could this make her wet, make her aroused? She was a lady, a
dominant, a Mistress � not some common whore to be entertainment for men, but
her body was not accepting her reasoning, and she felt herself grinding against
the horse she was strapped onto, aching to fuck back against the pistoning
rubber cocks. She wanted them to fuck her harder, faster, deeper.

&nbsp;

He unbuckled her
gag and drew it from her mouth, letting it slide out in a long wet slurp. He
spoke to her now, finally, and the sound of his voice flowed over her like
honey.

&nbsp;

�Are you my slut?�

&nbsp;

She moaned in
shame. How could these thoughts be in her head, how could all of this be making
her body react this way. She tried to mumble in the affirmative.

&nbsp;

�Speak up!� There
was rage in his voice, something she had never heard, and it frightened her to
the core.

&nbsp;

�Are. You. My.
Slut?� Each word hit her like a slap across the face.

&nbsp;

�Yes!�

&nbsp;

�Are you my
whore?�

&nbsp;

�Yes. Oh god
yes.� There were tears rolling down her face with the rawness of it all.

&nbsp;

�Does my slut
want to cum?�

&nbsp;

�Yes! please
yes!�

&nbsp;

�Does my whore
need to cum?�

&nbsp;

�Oh yes! Oh god
please yes, please!� The sound of her voice in ragged pleaded was so foreign to
her ears.

&nbsp;

�Good girl.�

&nbsp;

She was confused;
was that yes, was that no? His stiff cock silenced her, and she felt him drive
fully into her mouth, sliding over her tongue, until she felt the spongy purple
heat hot against the back of her throat. He slide back, then into her again.
One more withdrawal, taking him nearly out of mouth, was met with the suction
of her lips, as she needed to feel him inside her, as the machine never stopped
filling her up from behind. With the third thrust, he spoke to her, only to
her, and commanded her, �CUM.�

&nbsp;

She felt the
thick heat of his explosion in her mouth and throat, and she tasted it filling
her up as her own release fell upon her like a crumbling wall. It ravaged her
completely, and screamed with her mouth full of him, bubbling jism all around
her lips. Her mouth gripped and sucked him with all she had, and her body was
gripping the mechanical dildos with such force that she managed to slow the
motor noticably. The orgasm just wouldn�t stop, and became not quite multiple,
but one that just seemed to last and last and last, until she felt lightheaded
and her vision began to blur and darken at the edges. She slumped motionless on
the horse as she lost consciousness.

&nbsp;

She awoke with a
jerk in the tub, sending water rolling out over the edges as splashing across
the floor. Her face was flushed, and she was breathing rapidly. She couldn�t
remember a dream ever being so so vivid. She ran her hand over her face, and
tried to calm herself, but there was something there. A taste, on her lips. Her
eyes jerked wide open in disbelief and shock. But there was no way it could
have been.

&nbsp;

She bounded out
of the tub, wrapping a bath sheet around her as she ran to him, barefoot, her
wet feet pounding down the castle�s corridors, until she reached him.

&nbsp;

He was there,
caged, trapped, just as she left him. She turned from him, breathed a long sigh,
and wonderfed if she would bother to explain her appearance, when she returned
again, properly dressed. One thing seemed strange, though, and she turned back
to him quickly. There, on his thigh, was his cum. She just couldn�t imagine how
he could have brought himself to release while trapped so completely.

&nbsp;

Even more
troubling was the knowing smile in his eyes, that bared her to her core.

&nbsp;
