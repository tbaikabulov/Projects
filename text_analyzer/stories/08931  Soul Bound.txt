Synopsis:    To save Kelly's life, she must enact a ritual with her lover, Sarah.






�Kelly, are you sure you want to do this?� Sarah asked me for the fourth time.
�Yes,� I replied for the fourth time.
�OK. Take your clothes off and stand in the circle.�
I stripped off my clothes and kicked them into a corner. I stood in the center of the pentagram on the floor and gazed into the full-length mirror hung on the wall. I had short red hair, C-cup breasts, very pale skin, and a thin frame. I tried to capture the image of my naked body in my mind.
After all, I wasn&#8217;t going to see it again for a while.
Sarah had disrobed by now as well. She dropped a latex catsuit at my feet, then started rubbing my body down with oil. It was extremely sensual, and it made my skin glisten. I moaned softly as she gently squeezed my tits, and when she slipped a finger into my pussy.
�I&#8217;m gonna miss this body,� she whispered into my ear. By now, my body was completely covered in oil. Sarah stood back to admire her work. Then she handed me the jar.
�Do me.�
I eagerly obeyed, making sure to cover every inch of her sexy body. When I was finished, I knelt in front of her and kissed her between her legs. She pulled me up and kissed me on the lips. I let my tongue slip into her mouth. It felt wonderful.
�It&#8217;s time,� she said, breaking the kiss.
I turned my back to her and slipped my legs into the bodysuit. Then Sarah stepped in, her slick breasts pressing against my back. Our legs were pulling the suit taut. I knelt and pulled it up over us. I wrapped my hands around Sarah&#8217;s back while she put her arms into the sleeves. Then she zipped us up. We were pressed tightly together. It was so intimate.
But nothing compared to what would happen next.
Sarah leaned her head forward so it was touching mine, temple to temple. She intoned the words: �Mind to mind, we are as one.�
�Mind to mind, we are as one,� I repeated. I became aware of her thoughts, her senses. It wasn&#8217;t the first time we had made mental contact, so it wasn&#8217;t a shock. But this time, our thoughts were completely in sync.
�Flesh to flesh, we are as one,� she said.
�Flesh to flesh, we are as one,� I repeated.
My flesh began to melt. Sarah&#8217;s breasts were no longer pressing against my back &#8211; they had bonded with my back. The same went with my arms and legs. And our heads were bonded at the temples.
I felt my arms disappear, followed by my legs. I looked down, and saw that the leggings of the bodysuit now looked normal. I was being absorbed into Sarah&#8217;s body!
Next was my torso. It was like sinking backwards. I was already aware of her senses, but now they began to replace mine. I saw my chest shift, my breasts enlarging. Only they weren&#8217;t mine &#8211; they were Sarah&#8217;s. Within seconds, my chest was an exact match of hers.
My head was last. I closed my eyes, and simply let it happen. My head disappeared into the side of Sarah&#8217;s head. I was now completely absorbed into her body.
�Soul to soul, we are as one,� she said.
Soul to soul, we are as one, I repeated inside her mind.
That was it. The spell was done.
The reason for all of this was my health. I had always been a sickly girl. I spent a good part of my childhood in hospitals. I eventually found out that I had an autoimmune disorder. The doctors said that I would probably be dead by the time I was 30.
But Sarah wouldn&#8217;t have any of that. For one, she loved me with all her life. For another, she was a witch.
She discovered a spell that allowed one person to sustain the life of another. If it worked, I would be healthy so long as she was healthy. I wouldn&#8217;t have to go to the hospital every month anymore. I could live a normal life.
There were three catches. One, the spell worked by leaving my soul in her body. If she died, I would die too. Two, the spell involved fusing the subjects&#8217; bodies. I would spend one lunar cycle absorbed into Sarah&#8217;s body. This was necessary to establish the link. Three, the spell was totally irreversible.
This wasn&#8217;t something done casually. It demanded complete and total trust between the subjects.
Kelly? Sarah asked. Are you there?
I&#8217;m here, my love, I replied. I had full access to Sarah&#8217;s senses. I could see through her eyes. I could hear through her ears. I felt the latex on her body. But I had no motor control at all. I was an observer, a passenger. I suppose you could have called me a prisoner, but I was completely willing. And I trusted Sarah. I was literally putting my life in her hands, and I wouldn&#8217;t have it any other way.
This month would be interesting, to say the least.
