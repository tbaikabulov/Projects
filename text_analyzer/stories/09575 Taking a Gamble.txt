Taking a Gamble

Synopsis:   Becky loses a bet and goes into a bondage club as her forfeit. She ends up forfeiting a lot more than just her evening.






About one thing, we must be absolutely clear. The club was not Becky's idea. She had lost a bet with some of the girls in her dorm, and the price was that the loser had to visit this club and gamble at least $100. To be honest, she couldn't even remember what the bet was about anymore. All she could remember was feeling like she couldn't let those bitches win, so she went.

Becky was shocked at the sight as she entered. There were people there in clothes she had only read about on the internet on the occasional curious night. Around the room, she saw many couples in which one partner was clearly owned by the other. She could tell because the slaves wore little to no clothing, and many of them were collared. She realized quickly that in her conservative blouse and long skirt, she was the one who looked out of place. 

She quickly made her way over to the counter and paid for some chips. The man behind the counter gave her a hungry look that she did not quite understand, and he made sure to let her know that if she ran out, the house would be happy to lend her more. She paid quickly and left, eager to be away from the leering man. She didn't think to ask why the house would lend her more chips, or what the rate of interest would be.

After a few quick games, Becky was out of chips. She was pleased when a member of the staff brought her some more. He made a mark on her hand to show that the loan was made. After she spent those chips, he came back, gave her more chips and made another mark. This time she asked.
"Excuse me," she started hesitantly, "But what do these marks mean?" He looked at her with undisguised glee.
"They show you are in debt to the house," he replied. "You can borrow as much as you want, but at the end of the night, you have to pay your debt."
"How do I do that?" she asked, a shiver making its way down her spine.
"It could be anything," he said. "You could accept punishment or offer favors." Her stomach coiled at the thought. She vowed to play more carefully and win back the money she had borrowed. "There is one more thing you should know," the man said as he began to walk away. "If your debt is too deep, you will have to make up the loss at the auction.&nbsp; We sell those who cannot pay and any subs sold to us by their doms. If you are auctioned off, you will be taken by your owner as their slave for the next year."

Steven watched the young girl at the Texas Hold 'Em table with interest. She clearly had no idea what she was doing, and she also clearly did not belong here. Intrigued, he watched her glance nervously around the room. He saw how she looked in morbid curiosity at women in bondage, and how she could not even bring herself to look at the more vulgar uses some doms found for their subs. He was pleased to see how closely her tastes aligned with his. 
He wondered what had brought her into this place. Was it curiosity? Had she simply taken a dare? Now that she was here, he knew in his gut he wouldn't let her leave. Her flashing eyes and curvy body were just too much of a temptation. He needed to have her. He had had many submissives before, but he had never taken on a full time slave. Already, he knew she would be his first. 

By a mere few hours into the night, Becky was deep in debt. She had always been a poor gambler, and of course she had forgotten the cardinal rule - the house always wins. If she did not win her money back soon, she was going to be auctioned off at the end of the night to whatever male or female was intrigued by her. Normally she was a rather clever girl, but in her desperation she kept borrowing more and more chips hoping finally to get lucky and win her freedom.
"I'll make you a deal," murmured a low voice in her ear, after she lost yet again, going all in on pocket queens when some other bastard had been dealt pocket aces.
"Excuse me?" she said, turning to the speaker. He was tall, with dark hair and brilliant blue eyes. Immediately she felt heat rush to the place between her legs. She might not be having much luck at the table, but in some way fortune must have been smiling at her because this man was precisely her type. Of course, God only knows what kind of man he was behind that beautiful face and body.
"You are losing," he stated. "You will continue to lose the rest of the night. It's clear you have no idea what you're doing. At 2:00 AM, you will be sold to the highest bidder. He or she will own you for the rest of the year. You will be their slave, with absolutely no control over what � unsavory uses they might have for you." He glanced significantly over to some women being used as human toilets in another part of the room. She shivered. "I've been watching you," he admitted with no shame. "I think being used like that would destroy you." Fear coursed through her, and not the good kind as she contemplated taking one of those women's places. "Furthermore, I think you have guessed by now that this is not the sort of place that will check up with your owner to make sure you will be released after you have served your year."
"Help me," she begged him, realizing he might be the only person in the room who would. She saw the disgusting things going on around them. Bondage, even extreme bondage, didn't bother her. In fact, if she was truly being honest with herself it kind of turned her on. But some of this stuff� WaterSport, Scatology, Bestiality� she just couldn't cope.
"I have a counter offer," he said. "You let me cover your debt, and then become my slave. Indefinitely." She shivered. This man stirred her, but indefinitely? She was only twenty years old! She had hardly had the chance to live yet, and now he wanted to take that from her? Then again, if she didn't give herself to him, who knows who would buy her? She certainly would not find a more physically appealing Master.
"I don't know�"
"Think about it," he said simply. "If you decide to take up my offer, just tell the dealer you are going to sign a contract with Master Steven."

Steven continued to watch her from his room as he read. He could wait. There was no doubt in his mind that she would accept his offer. Blood throbbed in his groin as he thought about how he would use her. She wanted to be used, he could see it in her eyes. He was going to have fun revealing that side of her to herself. His suspicion was that she had been brought up to be a prim and proper young lady, the kind that would never talk dirty or allow a man to touch her. He smiled at the thought. Within a week he would have her tied up on his bed, begging him to fuck her.

A woman approached Becky as she continued struggling valiantly to win back her losses. She said nothing for a moment, merely lingering nearby, appraising her.
"Do you want something?" she asked, annoyance clear in her voice. The woman smacked her across the face.
"Don't take that tone with me!" she rebuked her. Becky glared at her. It was clear no one was going to stop the woman from hurting her, but Becky hated women who walked around like they were better than her. She held her ground.
"Tell me, child," the woman asked, "How old are you?"
"I am twenty, though I don't see what business that is of yours," Becky snapped. She was quicker this time, and dodged the next slap. The woman licked her lips.
"Perfect," she said. "Very feisty. I think I will enjoy training you." Becky's eyes widened in horror. She had no desire to enter any woman's bed, and certainly not the bed of such a bitch. 
"Mistress Eva, I should tell you that Master Steven has already made an offer," broke in the dealer smoothly. "She is unlikely to be up for auction. Perhaps you could work out a deal with him for the girl?"
"Steven?" the woman said, curling her lip. "The fool has never had a slave before. He wouldn't know what to do with her." Becky stored this bit of information away, as the woman stomped over to another table.

Steven growled as he saw Eva approach his slave. That hellcat was not&nbsp; getting his little treasure. He watched their interaction from his private room. He was pleased by the flash of fire in the girl's eyes after Eva slapped her. It was quickly replaced by disgust. He realized Eva must have offered to make her one of her girls. The crazy bitch loved prowling around the tables, picking out new sluts for her harem. From the girl at the table's reaction, he could tell she had no desire to be one of them. The dealer discretely said something to Eva, and he saw her look over at his little room, contempt written all over her face. He paid no heed to her disregard. At the end of the night, he was going to have the girl. She could curl her lip all she liked, he had won.

An hour later, Becky was even more in debt. She partially blamed this Master Steven. She might have played better if she had been able to get him out of her head! Now, however, the night was over. A decision had to be made.
"Hey honey," said a man, grabbing her ass from behind. "You seem a little low on chips. Keep an eye out for me at the auction. I'm going to buy your pretty little ass and then fuck it until you tear in two." She yanked herself away.
"Get off me, you prick," she snarled. "I'm signing a contract with Master Steven." Saying it, she realized she meant it. Some part of her had known the moment she looked into those captivating blue eyes that she would allow him to own her. She planned to bolt as soon as she got the chance, but she had by this point resigned herself to the fact that she would not be able to escape before losing her virginity. If she was going to be forced to share someone's bed, it might as well be the man who made her wet just by looking at her.
"Slave, follow me to Master Steven's private room," said the dealer, folding the cards. She bristled at being called "slave," but none the less she trailed behind until they came to a comfortably sized room. There was a large window a long the wall, disguised as a mirror on the outside, so those in the room could watch the rest of the club. The man himself was there, sprawled over one of the couches, languidly reading a novel. He did not seem surprised to see her. He gestured to the table in the middle of the room.
"Please, sit," he said. She saw the beginnings of a written contract were already on the table. She read it quickly. Particular lines stuck out at her, such as Master Steven reserves the right to punish his slave in any way he deems necessary, with the following exceptions: WaterSport, Scatology, Lactation, Bestiality, and Fisting. She saw that she was expected to obey any and all commands. She was forbidden from making sexual contact with any other man or woman, and he had the right to "mark her as his own." Overall, the contract turned her on more than it scared her. She also saw that he had made some promises as well, such as keeping her healthy, safe, and satisfied.
"Do you have any additions you would like to make?" he asked. The staff look quite surprised that he had even asked.
"I don't want to be penetrated anally," she burst out, thinking of the man who groped her earlier. She had two other much more welcoming entrances to her body. There was no need for someone to take her up the ass. Master Steven made a quick note on the contract.
"I can accept that," he said. "Frankly, I find the practice rather disgusting." She was pleased to see his tastes were so in sync with hers. Maybe serving him until she could escape would not be so bad. She decided to see how committed he was to the relationship they were about to begin.
"Also, if I'm not sleeping with anyone else, neither should you," she said rather boldly. He smiled. On some level, she realized that she was, in effect, designing a very kinky marriage contract.
"Granted," he said. He made another note on the contract. She took the pen from him, and before she lost her nerve, she signed it. He signed it as well, looking perhaps a bit too satisfied with himself. He paid for her in cash.
"I wish to watch her processed before you ship her home with me," he said to the dealer who had brought her in.
"Of course sir," he said graciously. "Please, follow me."

In the basement, Becky was transformed. First, her body was scrubbed down, and then she was given a complete, and humiliatingly personal medical exam. She forced herself not to cry as she was examined. The doctor seemed particularly pleased to find she was a virgin - so was Master Steven.&nbsp; Neither, however, seemed surprised. She blushed with shame, thinking they thought her too ugly for men to have seen her as desirable. 
The whole experience was difficult for Becky. She had never been naked before any man before, let alone several. Still, she did as she was told, afraid if she didn't that they would add her to the auction still continuing upstairs.&nbsp; She had seen the young men and women being auctioned off when they led her downstairs. They had been stripped naked and blindfolded, with their arms bound behind them. Prospective buyers were feeling them up before the auction, slipping their fingers into all the slaves' holes, and running their hands over the most intimate places. Becky had no desire to join their number, so she kept quiet. 
The doctor removed almost all the hair on her body with some sort of laser. He left only a little bit of pubic hair, and her long golden tresses were secured in a tight braid. Next a metal collar was snapped around her neck. She felt heat on the back of her neck, and then smelt smoke. She realized that they were soldering it on. Tears began to stream down her face. There was something so final about the collar - it finally sunk in that she had gambled her life away. The chance that she could escape now was slim.
"Do you want any other modifications, sir?" asked one of the staff. "We will do whatever tattoos or piercings you desire."
"Just one," he said. "Tattoo 'Steven's Slave' right here." He ran a finger over her mons. She trembled, and for the first time she began to fight as she was tied down. Of course, there was no way she could get away. 
"How dare you, you bastard!" she screamed as&nbsp; one of the staff members pulled out the equipment. No one paid her any heed. She was bound firmly, and the tattoo was on her mons by the time she was unbound. Finally it was all finished. "When will she arrive at my home?" he asked the staff.
"We will deliver her to you tomorrow evening, if that is convenient," said the attendant.
"Perfect," he said. He leaned over, and lightly kissed the top of Becky's head. "I look forward to your training, angel," he said softly.

She arrived at Master Steven's home in a crate. They had hogtied her, and buckled a ball gag around her head. She was still naked. She couldn't tell how far Steven's home was from the city, but she sensed he lived in a more rural area. After the box was still for quite sometime, she felt herself being picked up and carried. The box was set gently on the&nbsp; floor, and she blinked at the sudden light as it was opened. She felt someone undo the bindings around her wrists and ankles. It was Master Steven, she saw, looking almost painfully beautiful in black slacks and a black sweater. He also undid the ballgag. She pulled herself up to her knees, but for some reason it didn't occur to her to stand. She had been seen naked by so many men that she didn't even bother to cover herself. She simply left her hands at her side.
"Very good," he said approvingly. "When you come into my presence, always kneel and wait for orders." He adjusted her position slightly, straightening her back, and spreading her knees. Her hands he had her clasp docilely behind her back.
"Tell me how you feel, angel," he asked her. She thought about it for a moment.
"Exposed," she said. She saw no reason to lie. This was a relationship, albeit an unconventional one, and she had always believed that strong relationships came from honesty. She continued, "Alone, trapped, and a little bit frightened."
"When you address me, call me Master," he said absently. "Are you sure that's all you feel?"
"A little bit � excited, Master," she admitted after a moment, with a slight blush. She was rewarded by his knowing smile.
"Tell me, angel," he said, "have you ever been naked with a man before last night?"
"No, Master," she said.
"Have you ever sucked a man's cock?" he asked. She was startled by his rough language.
"No!" she burst out. She wasn't a slut! He raised a reproving eyebrow.
"No, Master," she quickly corrected herself.
"You will be punished for that error later," he said, then continued his questioning. "Have you ever been with a woman before?"
"No, Master," she said, wrinkling her nose in distaste.
"Exactly how far have you gone with a man?" he asked, apparently satisfied that she was not a lesbian.
"I've never even kissed a man," she said with some bitterness. He raised a brow again, and she quickly corrected herself. "I have never even been kissed, Master."
"Why not?" he asked, curious.
"I guess I never met the right man, Master," she explained. She hid her own self-esteem issues under the guise of being chaste, as so many women do. "Also, I wished to save myself for whatever man I might one day marry, and making out with strangers or casual sex felt like cheating." She was again rewarded by his pleased smile.
"You did well, angel," he praised her. "Everything is now ours to share." He sat down at a nearby armchair. "Come here, angel," he ordered. She stood and walked over to him. In one fluid motion, he turned her over his knee. He positioned her legs so that they were trapped under his left leg, and her body was bent over his right with her ass in the air. She began to squirm as he spanked her. She had a lovely ass, and the flesh of it turned a delicious pink as he smacked it. He stopped after twenty strikes. From her reaction, he suspected she had never been spanked before. He slipped a hand between her legs, and sure enough, it was wet. He showed her his glistening fingers.
"You were born to be a slave," he praised her. "See how your body reacts to this punishment? You crave it." He spanked her some more until she cried out. "Do you know why you are being punished?" he asked.
"Yes, Master," she said. "I forgot to refer to you properly."
"Have you learned your lesson?"
"Yes, Master!"
"Good." He allowed her to leave his lap and then as she moved to kneel beside him, he caught her in his arms, and pulled her onto his lap. Gently he brushed the tears off of her face. He saw no fear in her eyes, as he grabbed the back of her neck and pulled her to him in a possessive, passionate kiss. He started light, but soon took complete control of her mouth, ravaging it with his tongue. She reacted well. He could tell his touch was affecting her. She wrapped her arms around his neck. He repositioned her so that she straddled his lap. He knew she could feel the bulge of his erection through his slacks. Unconsciously, she pushed her sex into it. He heard her gasp of amazement when he stood, still holding her. He knew she must be realizing how strong he was. His hands held her by the ass and neck, while she clung to him with her arms around his neck and her legs around his waist. His lips never broke contact with hers, and he moved unerringly to his bedroom. He dropped her onto the bed as he began to strip. She watched him, hungrily.

"Raise your hands above your head," he ordered. She obeyed immediately. He bound her hands to the bed board. Then he forced her knees apart and bound her to the bed, opened wide. She was completely exposed to him, but for reasons she couldn�t understand, she wanted it. She wanted him. He stood over her as he began to play with her clit. She began to moan as sensations she had never felt before began to build. He slid two fingers into her wet pussy.&nbsp; She closed her eyes at the pleasure. 
"Look at me," he ordered her, he wanted her to be looking into his eyes as he pleasured her. She bucked against him as she came. The sensation of her virgin pussy spasming in his hand was unbelievable. He kept at it, teasing her and torturing her as she came again and again.
"Please, Master," she finally begged. He doubted if she even knew whether she was asking him to stop or urging him on. He paused only long enough to unbutton his slacks. He pulled out his cock and thrust into her. She cried out with the pain, but he calmed her, kissing her gently.
"It's all right, angel," he murmured in her ear. She finally relaxed and he began thrusting in an out of her. He found his release deep inside of her as she came once more, milking his cock with her rapidly contracting muscles. 

After he finished fucking her, he lay quietly on top of her for a few minutes. She slowly began to breathe normally again.&nbsp; Before today, Becky had had no idea that she could feel that way. The man clearly knew what he was doing. She sighed contentedly to herself, glad that he had offered her his deal. Being with him was so much better than being with anyone else at the auction would have been. Soon he had recovered, and he began to unbind her. Tenderly he massaged her sore muscles. When he finished, he pulled a plain button down shirt from his closet.
"You can wear this," he offered, handing it to her.
"Thank you, Master," she said, figuring that was probably the expected response. The man was unbelievably sexy, and she preferred his rewards to his punishments.
"There is food in the kitchen, angel," he said. "Make whatever you can."

She made them pasta. Master Steven quizzed her about her life as they ate, learning what skills she did and did not possess.&nbsp; She was intrigued by his questions. It seemed he intended to mold her into his own personal courtesan rather than just a simple fucktoy. He was going to make her into exactly the woman he wanted, mind and body alike. When dinner was over, he had her do the dishes while he read a book in the living room. When she had finished cleaning up, she joined him in the living room and knelt at his feet in the position he liked. After a half hour, her knees were really giving her pain, but she did not say a word, determined to avoid more punishment. When he was finished, he ordered her to bed. She immediately scurried into his bedroom.
"Strip, angel," he demanded, closing the door behind him. She hesitated. It was silly to be embarrassed, he had certainly already seen every bit of her there was to see, but now that she was clothed once more, she did not want to expose herself.
"Now," he ordered, with a hint of steel in his voice. She quickly stripped off the shirt.
"Kneel on the bed," he continued. "Face the headboard." Reluctantly, she did as she was told. She felt even more vulnerable on her hands and knees, facing away from him so she couldn't see what he was going to do. She felt him crawl up on the bed behind her. He began to play with her breasts, first caressing her softly and then teasing her nipples into hard points. Against her will, she moaned. He slid a hand between then, and then began slipping his fingers in and out of her wet pussy. She moaned again, and he replaced the hand with his cock. Slowly, deliberately, he slid into her small entrance. As he thrust in and out, she began to buck against him, forcing him deeper and deeper into her body. Finally she came, harder than he had made her cum before. Her whole body seemed to go rigid, and she could no longer support herself. Master Steven's hands on her hips held her up until he found his own release, and then they both collapsed on the bed. 
Before they went to sleep, he chained one of her ankles to the bedpost and used a tie to bind her hands in front of her. Even in her sleepy, satisfied post-coital state, Becky noted this and realized there must be some way for her to escape. It wasn't a guarantee, but it was enough hope to keep her strong.
