Synopsis:  Freddie Clegg & Phil Lane tell the tale of Jenny and her journey in search of her BDSM self...         







Chapter 1:&nbsp;&nbsp; Board Meeting

Two people are in two offices, a hundred miles apart. By coincidence they are both looking at the same page of the same magazine.

Larry Ross, thirty five years old with sandy hair that just might be starting to thin at the back and a waist that is just a bit thicker than he would like, is one of them. Until recently Marketing Director of Clegg Enterprises Special Products Division, Larry has been given a new job by Clegg and a new challenge, too.

The other is Jenny McEwan, a post graduate student and researcher at a university in the English Midlands. 

The magazine is Second Skin, a glossy BDSM and fetish scene magazine.&nbsp; The page they are looking at carries an advertisement placed by a business called �Inward Bound�.

They may be looking at the same thing, but they each have very different interests. Jenny is studying it closely. She is telling herself that her interest is academic, but that might not be the whole story. Larry, on the other hand, already knows about Inward Bound; when he first heard about it he was so impressed he recommended that Clegg Enterprises buy the company.

Jenny is remembering times when a new issue of Second Skin was the thing she looked forward to most of all.&nbsp; She recalls how she and her lover used to read it together in bed using its fetish imagery and kinky articles as a springboard for their own imaginations. It is a pleasant memory, but right now that&#8217;s the problem: it&#8217;s only memory. She goes on looking at the advertisement. She is going to discuss it with her PhD supervisor, Professor Dawney, later. She is suspicious of Dawney&#8217;s motives for suggesting that Jenny look at the advert. She is determined that she won&#8217;t end up in bed with the Prof again. Not this time.

Larry is sitting at an empty desk in an empty office in an empty building. It&#8217;s the first day in his new job; his first day as managing director; the first day of the new business venture that Clegg has set up. He takes one last look at the magazine and then puts it to one side.

He allows himself a few moments to savour the luxury of an empty diary, an empty filing cabinet and nothing more than the ideas in his head and an open-ended directive from his boss as the starting point for what needs to be done.

The directive was Clegg&#8217;s quiet, �Just get things started, Larry. Go talk to the people in Huntingdon. See how you can move things along.� It is a change for Larry; but it is a change for Clegg too. He isn&#8217;t used to letting somebody else run things. It&#8217;s obvious that neither of them will find the change easy to deal with.

For Larry it is definitely a promotion. Today he is starting on �Project Willing�, the result of ideas that he himself had proposed to Clegg. They aim to take over �Inward Bound�, a business that specialises in giving submissives a chance to experience consensual slavery. Larry isn&#8217;t sure which is going to be the bigger challenge, doing the job, keeping Clegg happy or keeping the business legitimate! 

He is, however, sure about one thing. The whole enterprise is going to work better with a cup of coffee but, with no kettle, no coffee machine, no coffee, no milk, no secretary it will have to be Starbucks, he thinks. 

There&#8217;s so much to do to even get the basics in place. He stands up, runs his hands though his hair and looks out of the window. Unsurprisingly, he can see the green and black sign over a shop front less than fifty yards away. He looks down at his waist line. He promises himself that he&#8217;ll have a low fat muffin this time. He knows he&#8217;s lying to himself.

He is half way to the door when the phone rings.&nbsp; �Ha! Interruptions!� Larry thinks, �That&#8217;s good. I must be getting somewhere already. You always get interruptions as soon as you start doing something important.�

He picks it up. �It&#8217;s Larry.�

�Hi, Larry.� He recognises the voice at the other end. �It&#8217;s Sarah,� she says. �I&#8217;ve just had a message from Mr. Clegg. He wants you for a special board meeting at 10:00.�

�Did Freddie say what it&#8217;s about?�

�No, Sir, but I sort of had the impression that he has something on his mind. He was, er, very definite if you know what I mean.�

�Thanks Sarah. I know what you mean. I&#8217;ll be there.� Larry looks at his watch. It will only take him fifteen minutes to get over to the Brick Lane offices.

Larry puts down the phone. With an empty desk and an empty diary there doesn&#8217;t seem like there&#8217;s much preparation he can do. He was going to call the people in Huntingdon they were planning to take over. That was going to be the starting point for �Project Willing�. But now, well it&#8217;s probably best to wait until after the board meeting. He looks at his watch. 9:30. Larry thinks, �I might as well walk round. It&#8217;ll be better for me than the coffee anyway.� 

The Brick Lane office has a seedy, unkempt air. It is set on the edge of the City in a 1950s block of dirty brick, peeling paintwork and metal windows. The building has an anonymous, non-descript feeling to it that suits Clegg perfectly. He doesn&#8217;t much care for ostentation. At least not in his business dealings.

At 10:00, Larry makes his way up to Clegg's office. 

The room is comfortable rather than luxurious, but then Clegg's preferred business forum is his club or the restaurant alongside it rather than the Whitechapel offices. Sometimes, though, he needs an office base, and this is it. 

Clegg's management style is usually pretty 'hands on'. He finds it hard to delegate. Worse still, he finds it hard not get involved with the detail. Larry remembers stories of how Freddie insisted on taking part in &#8216;operations&#8217; sometimes.&nbsp; He isn't surprised that Freddie is looking to involve himself even at this early stage. He had hoped he was going to get through his first day without it, though.

It's not as though he's even keen on meetings,� Larry thought to himself. �He&#8217;s never been strong on the formal &#8216;running the business&#8217; stuff.� As a result, Larry is surprised to see the room almost full. There&#8217;s even one of the secretaries there to take minutes. Larry is astonished. Freddie doesn&#8217;t usually go in for taking minutes.

Larry looks around the room. It&#8217;s not quite the usual suspects. Freddie is there, of course, and Elly (his business and, everyone assumes, personal partner) in her role as group legal adviser. Pamela Jordan, the group&#8217;s medical adviser, and Connie Mbazu, recently appointed as head of training, are both there, too.. There are maybe a half a dozen others lurking at the back. Given that the office isn&#8217;t much bigger than a table that has room for eight, it&#8217;s pretty crowded.

Clegg smiles and waves Larry to the one remaining chair. �Hello Larry, glad you could come. I just thought it would be good if we all had a chat before you got yourself stuck into things with &#8216;Project Willing&#8217;. Give us all a chance to make sure that things go in the right direction. No treading on toes. No dead ends. You know.�

Larry nods. He knows. He knows exactly. What this says is that Freddie&#8217;s changing his mind about things.

�The thing is,� Elly cuts in, �Freddie&#8217;s has been re-reading your business plan and looking at the due diligence from the &#8216;Project Willing&#8217; acquisition. We&#8217;re wondering if maybe the �consensual� division might be more important for the future of the Group than we thought at first.�

Elly had always struck Larry as dangerous. She is an attractive woman, her hair jet-black and curly and usually, as today, combed back from her forehead. Her eyes are piercingly blue. Larry always felt there was much more going on in her head than she ever spoke out loud. On their previous encounters, she&#8217;d given him a fair hearing and when she&#8217;d agreed to support him, she&#8217;d always delivered. She is wearing a smart, fitted, white blouse, a black leather skirt, black tights and riding boots. Her outfit tells you she&#8217;s a powerful woman, a woman that means business, and one that doesn&#8217;t mind your knowing it. 

�Yes,� Freddie continues. �We have to have an eye to the social and political context we are operating in.�

Larry is immediately worried. &#8216;Context&#8217; is a word he doesn&#8217;t normally associate with Freddie. It means that he&#8217;s been talking to people. That is invariably a bad idea from Larry&#8217;s perspective.
 
�The thing is, Larry,� Elly chips in, �that our business risk is gradually increasing whilst the fees we can charge clients can&#8217;t rise in step.�

�You see,� it was Connie now, �your marketing efforts increased demand significantly and that has created a problem. Shipping. The business now has a far bigger export market than our home market. Now we have to ship across international borders �.�

�Well,� says Larry. �None of this is news to me. This is all stuff we looked at in the marketing plan, way back. I don&#8217;t want to be unhelpful, but what&#8217;s this got to do with my business? If I start by trying to solve the problems of your side of the business, I&#8217;ll never get it started.�

�Sure, Larry. Sorry.� Clegg sounds almost apologetic. �Let&#8217;s slow things down folks. Larry&#8217;s right; we don&#8217;t want to get things confused. Let me just explain the problem though. The problem as I see it is,� Clegg looked around as if defying any of the others to interrupt him again, �, one of transport. The police and customs are now very interested indeed in the illicit movement of people.&nbsp; Their primary interest is in terrorist operations, but they&#8217;re very aware that a lot of illegal immigration and drug trafficking is involved with people trafficking, bringing in sex workers. And, that&#8217;s how our slaves are seen.�

�And,� Elly came in again. Clegg shuts his eyes. �While our usual measures serve to keep most of the law enforcement people on-side most of the time, we have to sweeten more people and that&#8217;s expensive.�

�Elly,� Clegg interrupted with barely concealed impatience. �And, of course, when Tricia was discovered all crated up and en route to Moscow. Well, let&#8217;s just say it didn&#8217;t help.&nbsp; We&#8217;re going to have the problem of shipping for some time to come. Unless we take a radical look at the problem.�

Larry is feeling increasingly impatient. �And, this radical look relates to my business in some way?�

Freddie nods and looks to Elly. �Do you want to cover this?�

�Sure,� she says with a smile. Freddie sits back in his chair, his hands folded across his stomach. �So Larry,� Elly continues. �We were thinking that if &#8216;Project Willing&#8217; could find people who wanted to be slaves, they would cross borders willingly as legitimate travellers to their new owners. That would avoid a&nbsp; lot of problems, not to mention a&nbsp; transport cost. I&#8217;m thinking we could get to having no real involvement in shipping beyond maybe organising their tickets.�

�Erm, well,� replies Larry. He&#8217;s irritated that everyone wants to jump on his wagon. �Well, I&#8217;m glad you all feel that this is going to be more than a side show, but a couple of things. As of today, right now, this moment, we do not have an operation in this space &#8211; there are a few ideas in my head and the possibility of taking over this new business. So, maybe I can get on with that?.�

Dr Jordan joined in for the first time. �I think you might be missing a point here. There will be people who contact you for an adventure holiday of consensual slave training. During their training, some of them are going to find that the lifestyle is something they would like to continue for an extended period of time. Then who knows? Maybe even 24/7/365 and on into their indeterminate future.�

�What we think we could be looking at, Larry,� Connie continues, �is a complete revolution in the slavery business, with a substantial proportion of slaves in harness because they want to be. They&#8217;ll and are prepared to approach us for contracts after their training. In fact, if we train them properly, the physical and psychological changes they experience will lead them to the point where that sort of request is more than likely and ��

�Of course,� Elly takes up the thread, �we would have to negotiate honorariums, health insurance and pension contributions on their behalf with their owners, sorry&nbsp; - our clients, as part of the package ��.�

Larry is trying to keep his irritation under control. He hasn't even got this thing started and the rest of the organisation is already trying to hijack it. He is about to lose his cool when Freddie cuts in.

�But in short, Larry,� Freddie leans forward trying to reassert some control, at one time pleased and frustrated by the way that everyone has been pitching in. �If I can just sum things up.� He looks around the room. The others at the table get the message and sit back. �I think -&nbsp; we all think - that this project is important for our future. . If there is going to be a growth in consensual slavery, it will affect businesses like us that focus on the non-consensual kind. This company we're acquiring has got facilities and they've got know-how that we can take advantage of.&nbsp; So, Larry, old man, I want to see how quickly you can get them integrated into the group and how soon we can learn the lessons we need to from them. I am going to give this a fairly high priority. Everyone here is really committed to giving you any help that you need.�

�So, no pressure then?� asks Larry.

�No,� smiles Elly. �No pressure at all! We all have complete confidence in you!�

Larry is used to them behaving like this. He knows how to deal with it. �In which case,� he says, looking around the table and smiling back at Elly in the quiet way he uses to re-assert control. �Perhaps you can let me have your feedback on the contracts that the Huntingdon business is using, Elly. And, Connie, you might like to let me know what your people thought of the site that the Project Willing business is using for their &#8216;experience&#8217; sessions and when you&#8217;re going to finish with Sukie and Rachel, so I can have them as was promised? And, Dr. Jordan, you could update me on the psychological profiling you were doing on their training people. Now that we&#8217;re all working as a team. So to speak.� He smiles at the others, happy that he&#8217;s made his point.

Clegg chuckles as the others mutter their agreement and start to gather up their papers. He turns to Larry and throws his hands up in mock surrender. �All right,� he says, �you don&#8217;t have to ask me. I&#8217;ll get the CFO to finish his financial review on the &#8216;Project Willing&#8217; business as well. Like I said, let&#8217;s get on with it.�&nbsp; 

While Larry is dealing with the machinations of corporate office politics, Jenny is on her own. She is in the room she shares with three researchers at the university, thumbing through Second Skin. She is looking at the photographs of fetish club events and wondering if she could persuade her husband that they should go to one. She remembers how much fun she had when she went with one of her girl friends, way back in her student days. The only problem had been that others there had got her wrong. Most of the men had thought she was a dominant. It was being quite tall and slim, she supposed. Or maybe it was just the rubber cat suit she was wearing. That and wishful thinking.

She smiles and pushes a strand of her shoulder length, dark brown wavy hair back from her face. She remembers the man that had tried to buy her a drink at the bar. He had taken the drink from the barman and got down on his knees to offer it up to her. It was one of the more original chat up routines she had come across, even if it hadn&#8217;t worked.

She smiles again, 

Jenny smiles easily. When she does so, her eyes open giving her a wide-awake look. She opens her mouth a little wider than might be thought polite, showing even white teeth and a touch of gum beneath her upper lip. 

Her research colleagues think of her as cheerful, open, and straight forward. Jenny puts that down to her determined chin and the way that her nose tips up. Occasionally though, as her colleagues would tell you, she can seem a bit na�ve and a bit of a romantic. Jenny doesn&#8217;t have an excuse for that. 

She turns the page. There&#8217;s an article on how a corset fetishist has combined her enthusiasms with the philosophies from Laura Doyle&#8217;s book, the Surrendered Wife. Jenny knows she&#8217;s supposed to be thinking about her research programme and she&#8217;s pretending to herself that this might have something to do with it. When the article moves on to describing the erotic combination of tight lacing and submissive demeanour, Jenny&#8217;s hands stray to the crotch of her jeans. She&#8217;s fondling herself; looking at a dramatically lit, black and white photograph of a kneeling, corseted, woman. She hears someone in the corridor outside. She gives a strangled cough and drops the magazine. She manages to slide the issue of Second Skin under the latest copy of the Journal of Behavioural and Cognitive Psychotherapy as one of her colleagues comes in.�


Chapter 2:&nbsp;&nbsp; Acquisitions

�I'm puzzled, Mr. Ross.� Corinne Aimes, the founder and owner of two companies, Huntingdon Management Development Limited and Inward Bound, is talking amiably with Larry Ross, a man who claims he can inject a substantial cash investment into her business. They are sitting in the garden of a Cambridgeshire pub. Corinne is drinking white wine. Larry is enjoying a pint of bitter. 

�So your business, Clegg Enterprises Group, specialises in recruitment and placement,� says Corinne. �Sort of head-hunters?�

Larry nods. Corinne is right, although not in the way she thinks. Larry is impressed by Corinne. She&#8217;s smartly dressed, dark wavy hair worn short of her shoulders and a dark, almost middle-eastern complexion. Her eyes are fringed with long dark lashes and her features are soft. Although she might be easy to look at, she has obviously got a determined streak when it comes to business negotiation. She&#8217;s sitting there looking every inch the successful young business woman. She&#8217;s wearing a sober suit with dark grey jacket and trousers, black ankle boots and a black high-necked blouse. Around her neck she&#8217;s wearing a heavy silver necklace. It&#8217;s not obvious at first but looking at the design Larry sees that it&#8217;s formed from two intertwined keys. It makes a subtle and stylish statement about Corinne&#8217;s interest in the world of BDSM. 

�I guess there is a sort of fit with our main business,� Corinne says. �and I suppose I can see why you&#8217;d be interested. Recruitment and placement on your side, training and motivation on ours.�
&nbsp; 
�Exactly,� Larry responds disingenuously. �The Group Chairman has something of a background in the training and motivation business. He's been looking to invest in those areas. Sees them as a sector that is likely to grow. Building the knowledge economy. Competing on a global scale. That sort of thing. And then, there's your rather unique sideline....�

�I'd have thought that would be enough to put most people off. There's not usually much enthusiasm for companies to get involved with businesses which the general public might see as racy, to say the least.�

�Our chairman is a broader minded man than that. And longer sighted. He&#8217;s interested in looking at leisure markets, too.�

�Well Inward Bound certainly falls into that category by my definition. Though I&#8217;m not sure if some of my guests right now would think that what they are enjoying was a &#8216;leisure&#8217; activity.� Corinne toys with her necklace and glances across to her car. �Your interest in that side of the business still seems odd to me.� 

Larry watches her, wondering for a moment if she has one of her clients in the boot of her Jaguar. He realises that the rather cool and conservative looking Corinne might just have decided to amuse herself by bringing a customer along on this outing. He finds the thought an arousing one but reluctantly drags himself back to the problem at hand. Larry seeks to reassure her. �Let's just say he understands people and he understands how businesses can make money out of dealing with people. If I'm honest, I suspect he's a bit curious about the whole consensual BDSM sexuality thing.�

�Well, it's a common enough turn-on, you should tell him. Otherwise this particular business would have no foundation.� 

Larry thinks wryly, it's not the BDSM thing that's puzzling him, it's the consensual thing. He lets it go. �So, tell me how you set it up; the Inward Bound side, I mean. The corporate training and motivation I think I understand from the papers you sent through.�

Corinne sits back. �Well,� she says, �I'd just finished my degree in educational psychology. I was finding it hard to get work. I had a few short-term contracts on research projects. Then the Uni set up the science park and there were a whole string of little businesses springing up as the faculty tried to find ways to make their research �relevant� or at least get paid twice for their work. Most of them knew next to nothing about business. Truth be told, neither did I,&nbsp; but the first rule of education is that if you've read one more book than your student you'll be OK, so that was where I managed to set up Huntingdon Management Development.�

�But the other side of the business?�

�I was coming to that. When I'd been in my last year at Uni and cash was short, I made a little extra with the odd bit of paid dominance. There are plenty of opportunities for it around a university town. BDSM is the thinking person's sex, after all. And, one of my clients from then turned up as a client for the training business. He teased me a bit about it, which was fair enough I guess;&nbsp; Said that he hoped my courses weren't as painful as my sessions had been; suggested that students would pay more attention if I taught class in a gown and mortar board. That sort of thing. Laugh a minute &#8211; you can imagine.

�Anyway, I was at a theme park the following weekend; ...on one of those scary rides that throw you around the sky until you're not sure if you're going to get to the end before your breakfast. And, I thought, why isn't there a theme park for adults? A sort of BDSM Centre Parcs. I looked around in the UK and there are a few places that offer accommodation &#8211; bed, breakfast and bondage, that sort of thing. There didn't seem to be anyone trying for anything more ambitious; something that would be a real experience for those taking part. I guess the place that really fascinated me was the Other World Kingdom, but that's in the Czech Republic &#8211; I thought there was bound to be an opportunity for something closer to home. Well, it wasn't too difficult to see that I could rework some of our training centre accommodation. I had a few contacts from my Mistress Whiplash days and some of the boys and girls in the legitimate side of the business weren't averse to making some extra money. It sort of took off from there.�

�The Other World Kingdom caters mainly for men though doesn't it. Your 'Mistress Whiplash' clients must have been mainly male too, I'm guessing.� Corinne nods and gives him a half smile that seems to suggest that if Larry wanted to try that side of things out she wouldn&#8217;t mind obliging. Larry avoids the thought. The only time he&#8217;s been tied up by a woman it wasn&#8217;t at all pleasant. �How come you ended up with something that seems to appeal mainly to women?�

Corinne shrugged. �I'm not sure. We didn't plan it that way. I'd like to pretend it was all part of some grand strategy, but it wasn't. We started off offering a 'kidnap &amp; hostage' experience. You know the sort of thing, the 'victim' agrees to an approximate time and duration, we snatch them, take them to some unknown destination, keep them captive and then eventually release them. Virtually all the takers were women. Either that, or it was boyfriends giving their girlfriends a treat.�

�And customers liked it?�

�Oh yes. It's a common fantasy and we did a good job, if I say so myself. Some of the team got quite adept at snatching the customers and bundling them into the back of a van or the boot of a car. Others turned out to be really good at the surly guard part. You wouldn't realise what a level of skill there is in it!�

�I guess you're right.� Larry is thinking that some of his colleagues back at the office might well agree with her.&nbsp;&nbsp; 

�We built up a range of different offerings and we managed to find a few different places to keep our customers. Somebody had a house with a cellar; someone else knew a derelict farm with some outbuildings. We even used one of the old supply stores at the University for one client. Anyway, word got around. It's like any other business &#8211; personal recommendation is the best source of new customers, but it does tend to turn up customers like the ones you already have. Then, one of our clients had a fantasy that involved her being held prisoner for a couple of weeks. One of the 'guards' thought that while she was there, they could put her through a sort of slave training programme. Afterwards, the client asked us to set up something similar for herself and three friends and things grew from that. We don't advertise much. There seems to be a captive market, if you'll pardon the expression. �

�And now?� Larry is happy for Corinne to go on talking.

�Well, we've adapted some parts of the site in Suffolk. We alternate the use between Inward Bound and the Corporate Training events. We bought the site using business start up grants. Inward Bound runs five courses a year, each of one month - although we're thinking of increasing that- with five participants. Five is all we can manage at present. We charge �6000 for a month's course - which isn&#8217;t that expensive when you think about it, compared to a cruise, say.&nbsp; Also, the Inward Bound clients help to get the Centre ready for the next Corporate Training course, which provides our Inward Bound clients with work to do and reduces costs in our vanilla business. Inward Bound currently grosses around �150,000 a year give or take. Costs are negligible, as I&#8217;ve explained, and even the staff costs aren't high. Quite a few of the staff have a stake in the business. All right the business is certainly not as big as it could be, or as profitable. On the other hand, growing it would take a lot of time and effort. The thing is, Larry, this business is doing all right. I'm not even sure what we'd do with an injection of cash from your organisation, except maybe to let us handle more participants in each course.� She looks at her watch again.

�Do you need to get back?� Larry asks.

�No it&#8217;s fine. I do have another appointment.� She looks across at the car again. Larry is more than ever convinced that somewhere, either in the back of the car or wherever she&#8217;s going, there&#8217;s someone that&#8217;s waiting helplessly for her. �But nothing that won&#8217;t keep safe until we&#8217;ve finished.� 

Larry is happy to continue. �You talked about both operations in the same breath: tell me about the team you have. Do you have staff from one business in the other, for example?�

�Yes, we do. As it happens all of the core team from HMD help out with Inward Bound. I mean, both are pretty small operations and its not as if we are operating in different countries or anything like that.�

No, just on different planets, from the point of view of the clients, thinks Larry. But he lets Corinne carry on.

�Actually you do not need many people to run a training business and there are three of us: me Charlotte and Josephine. We were friends at university and had a shared BDSM Interest. We have all put cash into the business.&nbsp; We&#8217;ve all made contacts in the Scene that have been helpful. I suppose I&#8217;m spending more time on IWB because that&#8217;s �ah� more labour intensive, so to speak.� There&#8217;s another glance across to the car. �There&#8217;s Gerry. He&#8217;s an architect and that&#8217;s been really useful to help with pulling our HQ into shape and then there&#8217;s Celia, George Jonathan and Ylena who all have their own jobs too but come to provide specialist input when we are running an IWB course. Then some of the alumni from previous courses who live reasonably locally can also help out.�

�So, are all your colleagues on the payroll?�

�No, not really. At this stage we are not generating enough cash and quite a few of the Team have their own mainstream careers, as I mentioned but we are now at the stage were we can pay everyone&#8217;s expenses, although most of the profits get ploughed back into the business as investment for the future. I think this works because we all really enjoy what we do and participation is part of the reward we get. However, enjoying your job doesn&#8217;t pay bills and we have to be hard headed about this.�

Larry looks at the cool, confident, young woman he has been talking to. It&#8217;s hard to believe that she would be anything other than hard headed when it comes to her business. On the other hand, the suspicion that she&#8217;s enjoying the discomfort of someone, somewhere, is enough to convince Larry that Inward Bound is a labour of love as much as a money making enterprise.

�Well Corinne, regarding our investment; we'd like to work with you to discover what the opportunities are. Maybe the Suffolk site could benefit from additional capital investment? Maybe you could find ways to take more participants on a course? Maybe you could offer different styles of programme? Or a two month experience? Perhaps if you weren't dependent on the corporate side of the business, you'd have more time to develop this? Let's get some of our people working with your people. We ought to set up a visit to the Suffolk facility. Our chairman is very keen on a collaborative approach.� Larry was almost surprised at himself for his last remark. Actually, his experience of Freddie was that his view of teamwork was a lot of people doing what he said. 

�Well,� says Corinne. �I agree it's worth talking. I&#8217;d like to understand more about your business too, if we&#8217;re going to work out how to best work together. And anyway, I&#8217;d want to know where the money&#8217;s coming from. You&#8217;ll forgive me if I&#8217;m careful - In my experience potential investors don&#8217;t come wandering in off the street every day of the week. And, frankly, I&#8217;m surprised that you are as interested as you are in the Inward Bound side.�

�Perfectly reasonable,� Larry responds. �Let me see if I can reassure you. We&#8217;ve spent time working at it, getting our management strategy and procedures right. It&#8217;s also one of the reasons why we&#8217;re looking for a UK business to invest in. Get some of our eggs out of the international basket, to diversify so to speak. If I&#8217;m honest I think our chairman has been involved in some businesses on the &#8216;leisure&#8217; side of things in the past &#8211; video production, fetish photo web sites, that sort of thing. I think he sees us working with you as a way of getting back into an area of business he always enjoyed.�
 
Corrine feels reassured. �OK, I can understand that, I would like to be less dependent on the corporate side, if I'm honest. This side of things is a whole lot more fun and the cash flow is a whole lot better. I get so tired of trying to screw payment out of some of the corporate clients.�

�Well, that's just the sort of area we could help with in the short-term. We could take over your debt collection.� Larry wasn't sure how well Freddie's debt collection techniques would work in the corporate world, but the important thing now was to get Corinne on side.

�Aha,� says Corinne. �Yeah. Well, maybe I have been distracted from the stuff I want to do by the things I need to do. If this relationship lets me change that, it might be a good idea after all. Look I agree. Get some of your people to come up to visit the Suffolk site. You&#8217;ll get a better feel for how we do things and I expect we will both get a better idea of whether our businesses would be a good fit for each other.�&nbsp; 

�Sounds like a good idea to me,� says Larry. At least that way we get to keep on talking, he thinks.

Talking is something that Jenny isn&#8217;t doing. She&#8217;s sitting at the end of her bed, her dressing gown pulled tight around her shoulders. Her husband is sitting on the bed at the other end, staring out of the window. Jenny is staring at her feet. It hasn&#8217;t been a very successful evening. Jenny had tried to talk about some of the things she thought might make their love making more fun. Her husband hadn&#8217;t been very receptive. Sure, he understood what it was that she liked and no, he didn&#8217;t thing there was anything wrong about it. The problem was that either he didn&#8217;t want to act out any of it or that he didn&#8217;t think it would work and in any case he didn&#8217;t want to talk about it.

Jenny&#8217;s fantasies revolve around dark, silent, strangers and dark silent deeds. And, in the past, there had been more than fantasies. But, Jenny felt, silence wasn&#8217;t really what was needed right now. What was needed right now was a good hard fuck. She just wanted him to hold her, tell it would all be OK some way and then throw her back on the bed and fuck her. But she didn&#8217;t say anything and Joe kept staring out of the window. 


Chapter 3:&nbsp;&nbsp; Fond Farewell

About six months later, Jenny McEwan finally gets to start writing up the notes she will use as the foundation of the research proposal that she hopes will eventually lead to her doctoral thesis.

Jenny&#8217;s Recollections

I watch as Joe tosses his case into the back of the taxi. He turns back towards the house for a moment and waves before getting in. We&#8217;ve been together three years now and I&#8217;ve found the partings getting harder and harder. It&#8217;s difficult too know which is worse; the going away or the coming back again. The closer we get to his going away, the more I feel like I'm walking on egg shells when it comes to anything about us.&nbsp; 

Well, maybe it&#8217;s the work. This time he&#8217;s going to Cambodia, north of Phnom Penh, working with the Vietnamese, helping the Cambodians to upgrade the water supply network there, Joe says. He&#8217;s only to be away two weeks this time, but the trip after this will be for almost three months.&nbsp; I&#8217;m quite proud of him really. It&#8217;s sort of heroic, I guess. At least, I say to myself, I&#8217;ve got something to think about while he&#8217;s not here, on top of what I want our relationship to be, whether it is going where I want it to go. Assuming I know.

Maybe I&#8217;m just trying for too much. Most of the time we bump along quite happily, but I think we&#8217;re missing out on something. Joe is a loving guy but, well, sometimes it seems like he&#8217;s happy to let things just drift along. I like to have time to chill out and relax, but I just feel there ought to be more to it than that. When we got together I guess his steadiness and the quiet, determined, way he approached life were some of the things that attracted me to him. Now, I'd just like to see a bit of passion about something sometimes. Especially about me.&nbsp;&nbsp; 

There&#8217;s always plenty to think about outside of home. My job at the University is demanding, but I think I am good at it. I graduated six years ago. I&#8217;m working as a researcher in the department of psychology and I feel I am making good progress towards my doctorate. The only problem there is Professor Dawney and that&#8217;s my own fault. 

The two of us had a short, tempestuous, affair while I was working for my master&#8217;s degree.&nbsp; I&#8217;ve always had an interest in the BDSM lifestyle - well more than an interest I guess, if I&#8217;m honest - and we met by chance at a munch. We discovered that it was a passion that we both shared. The professor and I found that our drives fitted neatly one with the other; me submissive, Professor Dawney very much the dominant partner. Subsequently, we managed to run our relationship without upsetting the university. It was hardly the first time that an academic had got involved with a student and besides Dawney wasn&#8217;t one of my tutors.

Then, two things happened. I finished my master&#8217;s and got a junior teaching post at the university. Shortly after, I met Joe McEwan and found myself swept up in a romantic dream of a future life with him, even if things aren&#8217;t looking like turning out that way right now. That was when I told Dawney that I couldn&#8217;t go on with our relationship.

The professor seemed to understand &#8211; eventually.

When Joe and I started our life together it was fine at first. Well it still is. Fine, that is. It&#8217;s just that I&#8217;d like it to be better, more than just &#8216;fine&#8217;. Maybe part of the problem for me is that he gets really closed off before he goes away on one of his trips. It&#8217;s like he feels he&#8217;s already on his way and doesn&#8217;t want to be confused with stuff from around home. That hurts, because I really want to have a close and loving goodbye each time Joe goes away.&nbsp; 

Also, we never really found a way to make the BDSM thing work between us. He seemed &#8211; well - diffident about it. And, when I tried to raise it he&#8217;d back away, saying it wasn&#8217;t �appropriate� - whatever that meant. It wasn&#8217;t that he disapproved; he enjoyed the tales I used to tell him of some of my more outrageous escapades from before we met. 

One of my boyfriends was keen on fetish clubs and we used to go together. It felt great to be dressed all in rubber and led in chains into a room to sit at his feet all evening. Then there was the time a girl friend and I had decided to go to a fancy dress party as a sheikh and a harem slave. It had seemed like a great idea but she&#8217;d got hold of some slave manacles that she could lock on me. The bitch left me behind in our flat while she had a great time at the party with the guy I&#8217;d been planning to hit on. Then, when she got back, she left me chained up while she bonked the guy senseless in the next room. By the time he left, I was so hot for it that we just fell on each other. There were a few more times like that. Somehow it was always me that ended up in rope or handcuffs or straps. But, then, that was how I liked it. 

Joe found the tales a turn on all right. But they didn&#8217;t make him want to try any of it.

I guess it seemed more that he felt it wasn&#8217;t right for him, or for him and me. But it didn't matter. Or, at least I told myself it didn't matter. 

I guess that's why I didn't back away from Dawney's suggestion &#8211; even though maybe I should have. Joe always seems pleased to get home and sorry to leave, but in between? I very much needed to keep myself busy.

Dawney encouraged me into pursuing a PhD and helped me choose a research area. I shouldn&#8217;t have agreed to take on something that was so close to Dawney&#8217;s own area, but I needed a supervisor and the professor had always been very supportive. Now though, things were getting difficult and it was becoming worse as a result of the direction my research was taking. When Dawney suggested the topic, I should have recognised the problems that could arise, especially the fact that it was bound to venture into areas where Dawney was considered the authority. But, I didn&#8217;t. 

The basic idea was to explore the relationship between stress and play; analysing the role that play has in reducing stress. I thought it presented an exciting research opportunity. It was only as the work progressed, that I started to feel that Dawney hadn&#8217;t let go of what we had once enjoyed together. The Professor&#8217;s slant on the study of the subject matter was that I should focus in my research area to specifically examine the role of BDSM play and stress. It was a legitimate subject for such research. It neatly avoided the pitfall of an overly broad focus on play, in general&#8212;which was a good thing. But, I couldn&#8217;t help but feel that an alternative topic might have been suggested if I had been a male student, or if the professor and I hadn&#8217;t been previously been involved with each other in the way that we were.&nbsp; 

The phone rings. I pick it up. The professor&#8217;s voice sounds calming after the tension of the exchanges with Joe as he&#8217;d left. �I wondered if you&#8217;d be in this morning.�

�Yes, sure. Why not?�

�Well, you said Joe was going away again and ��

I interrupt. �It&#8217;s just his job. It&#8217;s what he does. One month on, two weeks back. It&#8217;s a routine. I&#8217;m used to it.� I guess my one time lover knew that I wasn&#8217;t.&nbsp; To make matters worse, next time he is going to be gone for almost three months. I&#8217;m not looking forward to that except that it will give me some more time to think about what I want from our relationship, and whether I stand any chance of getting it. �I&#8217;ll be in. I need to talk to you about my work. I&#8217;m not sure which way I should be going.�

�Of course. Just drop by. I&#8217;ll be happy to give you some direction.�

I put the phone down, remembering the insidious way in which Dawney had pushed our power games and thinking, �I&#8217;ll bet you will.� I gather up my papers and push them into the old, green, canvas shoulder bag I use. Last of all, I collect up the bundle of fetish magazines that I&#8217;d been working through. Once upon a time, they would just have been fun but, while the content still gives me a thrill, this time the purpose of my studies has been more �legitimate�. I&#8217;ve been cataloguing the various references to different forms of play and picking up on the occasions when some aspect of stress, either increase or alleviation was mentioned. A forest of yellow post-it tabs stuck out from the magazines. Then, there were the copies of printed material from a whole series of BDSM discussion boards and forums. At least there was a volume of material to start working on.

An hour later, I&#8217;m knocking on the door of Professor Dawney&#8217;s office. �Just a minute,� comes the voice from within. I stand in the corridor hugging my pile of papers to my chest, the canvas bag hanging heavily from my shoulder. More power plays, I think. I lean back against the wall, staring down the corridor and on out through the window across the park. I&#8217;d become used to these little demonstrations of control. �Come!� Even Dawney&#8217;s invitation to enter seemed designed to intimidate.

�Oh, Jenny, excellent,� Dawney&#8217;s greeting is fulsome. At once, I remember how I had been first attracted to the professor. Angela Dawney manages to combine a cool authoritative air with an almost Bohemian sense of the unconventional. The university is no longer the domain of the unconventional &#8211; the continued quest for funding and the need to make research �relevant� means that today&#8217;s departmental heads are as much business people as academics. But Angela Dawney is an eccentric oasis in a desert of convention.

Angela smiles as she pushes back a strand of hair. She&#8217;s only 38, maybe 10 years older than I, but her hair is already greying in places. Not that she cares. She is driven, and believes in making the best of herself, but I&#8217;m not sure that applies to the way she looks after her appearance. She can look a bit matronly, when she&#8217;s not careful. 

Her office is filled with the usual collection of piles of books and journals. Her desk is covered with them too. Her laptop is propped on a top of one of the smaller piles, a web cam clipped to the screen peering out at the room like the eye of the Cyclops. A message window blinks, irritated, demanding attention. The only things on her desk apart from that are three framed photographs of Angela with the other academics at the Psychology Research Conventions in 2005 at Denver, 2006 at Stanford and 2007 at St Petersburg.

The Professor prides herself on being at the centre of an international network of specialists. The result is that she finds herself sought out to peer review papers, edit journals and comment on research proposals. 

The rest of the office is buried beneath the accumulation of knowledge; a bookcase, a side table and two chairs are suffering in the same way as her desk as is a good three quarters of the floor. �Find yourself some space,� Angela calls, waving vaguely.

I look around and come to the same conclusion that many of Angela&#8217;s students do. There was nowhere else but the floor. I push a couple of the piles of books to one side and squat down, cross-legged, on the carpet, looking up at her. She likes that.

Angela swings her chair around to face me. She puts down the unlit cheroot she has been chewing on in, defiant against the college&#8217;s attempts to outlaw all forms of tobacco abuse. She brushes some biscuit crumbs from the lap of her calf length skirt. As she leans forward, my eyes are drawn to the Victorian style buttoned boots that the professor invariably wears. I remember a time when I would have wanted little else but to be sitting where I was then. I shrug to try to shake myself back to reality. �So,� Angela says, �tell me your thoughts so far.�

I launch into a summary of my progress so far, the material I&#8217;ve collected, the avenues explored. 

�There is very little firsthand objective observational data. I think this is understandable. On the one hand, BDSM play has only surfaced into the public arena in relatively recent years and on the other, I guess it takes time for it to become a �respectable� subject for academic research. Then again, objective observations of BDSM behaviour are difficult to make without disturbing the participants. Imagine: you are in the hands of a Domme who is giving your bum a good going over and in the corner there is someone writing every thing down and then asking a whole series of questions about how it feels.�

I look across at Angela, concerned that she thinks I might be trivialising the discussion. Of course, she would be the last one to put herself in that situation. She doesn&#8217;t seem worried. I carry on. �Also, male behaviour has been the first target for scrutiny &#8211; guys in high powered jobs going in for sessions of role reversal as a way of escape. And females? Well, there is not a great deal to be had about women under occupational stress.&nbsp; Again, it&#8217;s only in fairly recent years that one could find a significant number of women working at senior executive level and I think political correctness discourages the idea that some women might have a submissive sexual drive co-existing with a high powered management or technical job. And, of course, &#8216;super woman&#8217; can&#8217;t possibly suffer from stress and require a somewhat exotic way to deal with it.�

Dawney looks thoughtful. She reaches out and I pass her a pile of the research papers I have been working through. Dawney rifles through them. It is a field she is familiar with and one in which she herself is considered to be an authority. From time to time, she peers down at me over her gold rimmed half moon spectacles. �I think you&#8217;re right,� she says. �This looks like a thorough collection of the existing research and I&#8217;d trust your assessment.� I feel pleased. Angela&#8217;s praise has always lifted me up. �But you&#8217;re an ethnographer. You must feel you have the ability to do original research in this area. To observe, to analyse, to draw conclusions from observation.�

�That&#8217;s what I think is needed, professor,� I say, anxious to keep things on a professional footing, and conscious that I am also venturing into an area that my mentor considers very much her own. 

�Good� says Angela. �That&#8217;s why I asked you to look at the Inward Bound advertisement. I think it might be an interesting area of research for us. A sort of ready made sexual laboratory, I&#8217;d like you to go on one of their courses.�

�What?� I&#8217;m shocked by her proposition. It seems way out of line. Just another example of Dawney trying to restart our affair.

�Hear me out, Jenny,� she says. �This has got nothing to do with anything in our past. This is purely for research. Inward Bound&#8217;s courses offer a degree of immersion that you wouldn&#8217;t normally find. There&#8217;s a chance to observe genuine changes in behaviour and response. We couldn&#8217;t possibly reconstruct it in a laboratory.�

�That&#8217;s all very well, Professor,� I feel I want to get this onto a formal footing. �But it sounds like pretty dubious science to me. I don&#8217;t see how you can achieve much with an observer that is also a participant. And no matter what we got up to,� I look directly at her. Angela at least has the grace to look a little abashed, �I know that I&#8217;m hardly very experienced in BDSM and while, yes, I might find it a personal turn on, I can&#8217;t see how we would get any useful ethnographic results from it.�

�Of course, Jenny. You&#8217;re right. That&#8217;s not what I&#8217;m suggesting. What I think we should do is to try to establish if Inward Bound really would provide us with a suitable environment for a properly controlled research project. If you can get a real feel for what goes on there we could see if we really could answer the research questions that are coming out of your studies.� 

�Wouldn&#8217;t it be easier and more ethical just to have someone sit in on some of their sessions?�

�Easier, certainly. I don&#8217;t think it would give us the best insights though. I think it really needs someone that is there and part of it. Either as part of the staff or as a course member. I couldn&#8217;t see you as part of the staff though.�

That&#8217;s unfair, a cheap jibe, I think. I am how I am. I&#8217;m not ashamed of my submissive responses. 

Angela sees that I&#8217;m annoyed by her remark. �Sorry, Jenny. That was unkind. I do think that participation is an important element in allowing us to set the research agenda here. But of course, if you don&#8217;t feel that it&#8217;s something that you would like to do or feel able to do�.�

It&#8217;s the same old, manipulative, Angela. And when we were together I did enjoy it. Now it&#8217;s difficult. I really don&#8217;t want to get myself back into a relationship with her but, on the other hand, the Inward Bound idea is intriguing and it could turn out to be an area for really interesting research. A guaranteed doctorate! I feel myself being drawn to the idea. It&#8217;s probably unwise but I start talking through some ideas.&nbsp; 

�Well, I could try to record some direct first hand observations of the submissive experience that Inward Bound provides. I could use a quasi-ethnographic approach. Although we&#8217;d have to recognise that the value of the results would be very limited for anything beyond establishing a research framework��

�Of course,� Angela interjects. She can see that I am sliding myself in to the idea and she knows that she only has to oil the slope.

�Then I will see whether it&#8217;s practical to come up with a more scientific research programme.� 

�I like that idea, you&#8217;d treat participation as a sort of pilot � hmmmmm �,� Angela says, polishing her glasses. �Give it some thought,� she continues �I genuinely think it&#8217;s the best way to move your doctorate forward. I know you&#8217;ll be thinking this has something to do with what went on before but it&#8217;s really about your studies. I suggest you explore what is involved. I&#8217;ll find out what I can do about funding.�

I smile. As usual Angela assumes agreement. I offer her my thanks, pick up my things and start to leave. I&#8217;ve learned enough from my time with Angela to quit while I am ahead. Besides,&nbsp;&nbsp; I&#8217;m still not sure if I want to go through with this.

�Do you have to go?� Angela says. �With Joe being away, I thought you might need some company.�

�Sorry, professor, I have to go,� I say keen to return things to a professional footing.

Angela looks disappointed. �Perhaps another time,� she says.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

That&#8217;s exactly what I am worried about but, when I get back to my office, I spend an hour before going home thumbing through Second Skin again. There&#8217;s an article about enthusiasts for wearing fetish clothing in public. I&#8217;m fantasising about what it would be like to be dressed in rubber, following Joe around our local supermarket on a leash. Then I hear someone at the door. 

The fantasy dissolves instantly. I toss the magazine back onto my pile of work papers and head back to my empty home.

Chapter 4:&nbsp;&nbsp; First Contact

Jenny&#8217;s Recollections

A few days after my meeting with Angela, she sends me an e-mail: �Dear Jenny,� it says. Angela&#8217;s e-mails always sound like letters. �I hope you have been thinking about your proposed exploratory investigation.� So now it&#8217;s &#8216;my proposed investigation&#8217; I think. �Contact Inward Bound and see what they have to offer.&nbsp; At this stage, I think you should regard this as a pilot project as we discussed and I think you should approach them as an ordinary client. I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ll agree that their approach might be different if you state your academic interest right away. As I&#8217;ve always said the foundation of good field work is minimum bias and maximum objectivity. As far as funding is concerned, it will depend on their fees, of course, but I hope we can use some of my Endowment Funding. Best wishes, Prof.�

When I first looked at the Inward Bound website, I was amazed, curious, intrigued and delighted, in that order. From a research point of view I can agree with the Prof:&nbsp; it was fascinating. I have seen some similar sites, but they were in the USA or Eastern Europe and almost without exception they are focused pretty much exclusively on the fantasies of male submissives. Angela&#8217;s enthusiasm has made me more than a little nervous, though. From what we had shared together, I can imagine that her interest in Inward Bound might be more than academic and it wouldn't be with her joining in as one of the consensual slaves. I am still worried that she might see this as some opportunity to revive our personal relationship. 

On a personal level, Inward Bound could offer me the chance to fulfil the sort of fantasies that had been with me since I was a young teenager, things that I hadn&#8217;t shared even with Angela when we were together. Sure, I would prefer to be playing this sort of game with Joe, but he felt it was not �appropriate�.&nbsp; It&#8217;s strange. Joe and I have this really open relationship; we can talk about anything, but somehow when it comes to this the shutters come down. Maybe it's me or maybe it's him. I found it difficult to say what I wanted; he found it difficult to take the lead. What ever it is, it hasn't really worked out for us. The vanilla sex was fine &#8211; he was kind and loving and friendly and it was great. The trouble was it wasn't enough. But I would rather be playing with Joe. Wouldn't I?

I try to put my personal interests and my feelings about Joe to one side. In the context of what I am supposed to be doing, they aren't going to help with objectivity! Still, it&#8217;s hard not to think about him. And us.

I&#8217;m looking at the home page of the Inward Bound web site. �Inward Bound� it says in a professional looking style with sober colours. "The place to explore your submissive fantasies in depth. Join us for the chance to experience consensual slavery. Extended courses let you lose yourself in your wildest dreams.�

I must have looked at this site twenty times, or more. At first, I thought it was too good to be true;. Each aspect of what Inward Bound claimed to do pulled at my own desires and spoke to what I felt might be the&nbsp; research needs, too. I wrote notes on the site for discussion with Angela, but I kept being drawn back again and again. I almost knew the content by heart: the facilities that they had; the range of programmes they ran; the sort of experiences that the slaves, or as they called it �participants� could expect; the importance they saw in helping participants take each step along their own personal journeys. I guess you might think that showed more than professional interest, and I think you would be right.

I suppose that I just sort of fall towards a decision. I have the opportunity; Joe will be away for nearly three months over the summer. I have the motive; the chance to find out finally, if this flavour of sexuality is as exciting in fact as it is in my head.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Best of all, I have the alibi; it really will be pioneering ethnographic research. Won't it?

So here I am, looking at the Inward Bound web site again. I&#8217;ve told Angela that I&#8217;m prepared to do it. She has told me she can get the funding. She&#8217;s promised there no more to it than research. I still don&#8217;t think I believe her but I&#8217;m not going to stop.

At the top of the page it says, "Register For More Information Now." I'm looking at the on-line online form that I have just completed.

Name, age, e-mail contact and mobile number. It could be a holiday booking site.

Level of experience of BDSM. Sexual likes and dislikes. So, not like many holiday booking sites there.

There&#8217;s a part where they ask about my general medical history and rather some more specific questions about my sexual history. It&#8217;s embarrassing in one way to be exposing this, but the questions are very politely asked and the anonymity of the computer makes it easier.

�How long could I stay?� the form asks and then �What would I like to achieve?� That&#8217;s a difficult question and I&#8217;m not even sure I know the answer. Plus of course, I don&#8217;t want to say anything about the university. I look at what I&#8217;ve typed in. �To understand my submissive responses better.� It sounds a bit lame, but it will do. And it&#8217;s true. It&#8217;s probably not all of the truth, but it is at least true.

Finally, there is the inevitable �where did you hear about us?� I tick the box marked �Second Skin Magazine� and now the last box is gently and seductively blinking at me: ��Send?�, �Send?�, �Send?�, �Send?�

With a stab of adrenalin running through my body, I press the return key and send the form! 

At once I&#8217;m thinking, �Gee, what have you done, girl? Was that really wise?�&nbsp; Joe is not easy at all with my thoughts of master / slave games. What if I find out I really enjoy it as much as I enjoy my fantasies? Where does that leave Joe and me?

Before I can think too much about it, a new box opens on the screen. �Dear Jenny. Thank you for your enquiry. We&#8217;re delighted that you&#8217;ve decided to get in touch with us. This is an automated reply, but Charlotte will try to call you tomorrow and will leave you an e-mail if she cannot reach you. Best wishes and thanks again from the Team at Inward Bound.� 

And again, I&#8217;m caught between conflicting emotions. On the one hand, I&#8217;m taken aback to get a response so quickly, perhaps even a little uneasy that a reply came at all. On the other hand, I&#8217;m reassured by the tone of the Inward Bound reply; it seems friendly and very professional. And, now I feel I am in a corner.&nbsp; I am going to have to follow this through.

I go to bed. A large whiskey helps me into a deep sleep.
�
I wake up really rested. My mind turns over the jobs for the day and I&#8217;m asking myself why I feel so relaxed and good? At the back of my mind, though, I&#8217;m feeling that there is something difficult to do today. Then I remember Inward Bound and a stab of anxiety drives me out of bed, to the bathroom and then downstairs to breakfast. I&#8217;m fretting about whether I&#8217;ve done the right thing. The feeling is still with me as I leave the flat and start my journey to the university.

It&#8217;s 10 am &#8211; or just after. I have a lot to do today and I am in the middle of setting out the day when my mobile rings. My eyes are still scanning down my list of �work� e-mails as I casually answer, feeling slightly irritated about the early interruption. The unfamiliar voice on the phone jerks me back to full attention.
 
�Hi, is that Jenny?�

�Yes.�

�Hi, it&#8217;s Charlotte.� There&#8217;s a pause. �...Look, I&#8217;m sorry to catch you at work, but did you send us an enquiry form through our web site last evening?�

�Erm, erm, yes, I did, actually.� I feel embarrassed, as If I&#8217;d been caught doing something I shouldn&#8217;t have. Charlotte laughs. It&#8217;s friendly, understanding, a laugh that encourages me to let down my guard. 

�Great. Look, I was just calling to make a first contact.� Her voice is light and she sounds approachable. �If you would like to take your enquiry a little bit further, I would normally arrange to meet you maybe at your place or over coffee in town which is often best. I&#8217;m sure there will be other things you want to know. I can give you more information before you take any more definite steps. And I&#8217;ll want to make sure that our programme will fit in with what you are looking for, too.�

She stops. I can&#8217;t think of anything to say.

�Would you like that?� Charlotte says. �Just to find out more? Maybe next week?�

My mouth is a bit dry now and I&#8217;m sure my voice is shaking. �Erm, yes please, erm thank you. Yes. Yes definitely.�

So, a week later, here I am in a quiet corner of Caf� Nero and absolutely on cue a girl about my own age saunters in. Tall, slender, athletic looking. Blond hair, folded into a French pleat. Piercing blue eyes, pale skin; she could be Scandinavian, I think. Blue jeans and white blouse under a leather jacket. She has cowboy boots on and carries a rather informal,&nbsp; but smart leather brief case. The jacket, boots and bag all match, in the same soft tan leather. In a word &#8211; class. She pauses and calls a number on her mobile. My mobile rings. So, this must be Charlotte. Heavens: this really is for real, then?

Charlotte sees me reach for my phone. She smiles, comes over and puts her hand and rather familiarly on my shoulder. �Hi, Jenny, I&#8217;m Charlotte.� She sits down. �Good to meet you.� She looks at my still full coffee cup. �Do you want another she asks?� I shake my head. �I&#8217;ll get myself some water.�

Moments later she is back. She opens her brief case. Forms. The whole world runs on forms these days. Even people in the fetish world have forms. She can see I&#8217;m nervous.

�Look, I&#8217;ll start if that&#8217;s all right. Usually,&nbsp; it takes applicants a while to get their heads around the fact that this could really happen for them, so it probably easier if I lead off and then I&#8217;ll let you ask questions afterwards. OK?�

I nod, grateful that she&#8217;s taking the lead, pleased that in spite of her ice maiden looks, she's friendly and approachable.

�Well, there are one or two more things we have to know about you, mainly psychological outlook and some more medical. The thing is that the whole idea is for you to enjoy the course, but as it can be a bit demanding....� Charlotte smiles at me. I grin back. �As it can be a bit demanding it&#8217;s important we know were we are starting from with each of our applicants. We need to be able to exercise our Duty of Care and we can only do that on the basis of the right information. I hope it&#8217;s OK with you to go through this now?� I nod in response.��We do hold the data on computer, but we would rather not scatter your answers across cyberspace. We take data protection very seriously.�

As I make my way through the questionnaires, I can see why! Finally, I finish the forms and pass them across to Charlotte. �So what happens now?� I say.

�Well, let&#8217;s see.� Charlotte thumbs through some of the questionnaires. �OK.&nbsp; You are really pretty much a complete novice, apart from this,� she&#8217;s looking at the part of the form where I had to list previous relationships with details of any BDSM activities involved. �It sounds as though it gave you some experience of power exchange. Oh, I like this &#8211;�

�What?�

�This bit here: &#8216;I would like to find out if this type of sexual trip is as exciting in reality as it is in my head.&#8217; &#8211; that&#8217;s very helpful. I think you will find the answer is &#8216;yes&#8217;, by the way.�

Hmmm. Yes for me but is that good for Joe and me, I wonder?
�
Charlotte leans forward. �Jenny,� she says, �here is where we go now. We run the courses four times each year and the next will start in June. There will be other people on each course. There could be both boys and girls. You don&#8217;t have to interact,� Charlotte winks in a meaningful way, �if you don&#8217;t want to or if that is a Red Line Issue for you. You will experience what it is like to be a slave, to follow orders, to be punished if you fail to follow them, to have your freedoms restricted, to be trained to perform better.�

I gulp, a little uncomfortable. If I&#8217;m honest I&#8217;m a bit turned on at this point; sitting in these very ordinary surroundings with this attractive woman discussing these extraordinary ideas.

Charlotte gives me an encouraging smile. �It&#8217;s very important to us that you feel safe at all times. We will give you a safe word which you can use at any time to stop the action. However, one of the features of these courses is that they will help you to push against your limits, so we like to encourage participants to keep going as long as they can. To help you through, we give you a 10% financial rebate at the end, if you have managed not to use any of your lifelines so to speak.�

I nod.

�One other thing. We also need you to let someone you trust know where you are going and they get a contact phone number &#8211; a landline number which is traceable by the phone people &#8211; to get you in emergency. You get a �safe call� to them when you arrive to confirm you are OK. Again, that&#8217;s designed to help you to feel safe, but of course it&#8217;s a bit of an insurance policy for us, too.�

�Now, assuming you still want to go through with this. Sometime next week I will send you an e-mail consent form which you have to sign and return as hard copy to our business PO box and also a booking form to confirm when you would like to come. And also you&#8217;ll need to make payment! We need you to pay in advance for each month, so if you were following a two month course, you will need to tell your bank when to make the second payment. If you&#8217;ve any questions in the mean time you can just e-mail me. Use the questions@IWB as the address and don&#8217;t forget to give your name, so I can deal with it.�

It all seems pretty clear. I say, �Thanks. Yes, That&#8217;s fine. Yes.�

Charlotte starts to pack up her papers. �Well, is there anything you want to ask me now?�

I don&#8217;t really know what to say. I think for a moment and then blurt out. �Have you done the course?�

Charlotte smiles. �Oh, I&#8217;ve had a lot of involvement in the courses,� she says, �but not really as a participant. Some people are better at giving instructions and some people are better at taking them, don&#8217;t you think?� She looks straight into my eyes. 

I try to respond nonchalantly but it just comes out as a muffled whimper. Charlotte grins. �OK, Jenny that&#8217;s me done!� She leans forward and kisses me on the cheek: not a sexual kiss, more like two girl friends together. She smells nice. Something from Santa Maria Novella? �I really hope we meet up again soon! Bye!� And with that, she&#8217;s gone. 

One week later, to the day, I open my e-mail in-box and there is the Inward Bound e-mail from Charlotte, �Hi, Jenny. As promised, here is your consent form and booking confirmation form. Booking and payment is electronic &#8211; just click the link. The consent form has to be printed out, signed and sent as hard copy to the address you will see at the end of my note. Best wishes, Charlotte.�

Oh boy, what do I do now? This really is decision time. I know Joe will be away for the best part of three months from mid May. He gets back in early August. Inward Bound&#8217;s next course starts in early June. My teaching commitments will be over in June. And the financial bit is being paid for by Prof. 

Putting the research angle to one side, I ask myself how do I feel deep down? Deep down, I want to do it. To see how far it is. To find if I really am as I think I am �

Later that day, Prof has a few free moments and I take the e-mail and blank copies of the forms to her in her study. I don&#8217;t want her to see the version I finally signed. I could imagine the snide remark when she saw that I said I didn&#8217;t want to be involved in direct sexual contact.&nbsp; I also didn&#8217;t want to have to defend the fact that I&#8217;d consented to being marked or pierced subject to agreement at the time it happens, Angela had always been keen for me to have my nipples pierced but I&#8217;d resisted at the time. Now it sounded quite sexy but I knew that she&#8217;d be irritated.

She reads them through carefully. Fortunately she doesn&#8217;t ask me how much I&#8217;ve been prepared to sign up for. �OK, so it looks as if June is the time. I can manage to cover the fees from the endowment funds.� She peers at me over her glasses. �I guess I can rely on you to help the fund out by coming back with the 10% discount?� Angela smiles indulgently, but it&#8217;s going to be my bum on the line. I guess that&#8217;s why she is smiling. �How long do you need to be there?�

I hesitate, �Err, well, I&#8217;m not�� 

�Look,� says Angela, �I think we should send you there for a couple of months. You will be much better placed to take stock of the situation after that. You will find it easier to get immersed in things over the longer period. It will help with an objective assessment of the research opportunities and challenges.�

I can see the sense in what the Prof is saying, but what her motives might be worries me. 

�Actually, I like their approach.�

�How do you mean?�

�Well, they talk about Duty of Care, and they have seriously addressed the idea of Informed Consent. They leave you with a channel of communication to someone on the outside. I can do that for you, if you like. That&#8217;s good. Very well thought out. You seem to be in the hands of professionals.� 

I hadn&#8217;t thought about who would be my life line. The Prof is the obvious choice I guess. So I&#8217;ll be in the hands of professionals. Yes, and I will also be in the hands of Professor Dawney, my former lover, my life line to the outside, my link to the real world.

In the mean time, I can look forward to Joe&#8217;s getting back and working out how to tell him what I&#8217;ll be doing during his next trip. If I tell him what I&#8217;ll be doing during his next trip. 





Chapter 5:&nbsp;&nbsp; Goodbye &amp; Hello&nbsp; 


Joe&#8217;s been home for three weeks and he&#8217;s going back to Cambodia soon. This has been a good break. I managed to grab some time for us to be together out of the teaching and research schedule. We&#8217;ve even managed a couple of days away in this really cosy hotel up on the Yorkshire coast, not far from Whitby. Joe seems more relaxed away from home. Maybe, if you travel as much as Joe does at the moment, you just feel more comfortable in hotels? 
Whatever the reason, it's been good for us. We&#8217;ve walked on the cliffs and eaten good food and talked about nothing and shagged like rabbits and it&#8217;s been great. 

But, I nearly spoil it. I had told Joe that I would be away while he was, doing some field work for my thesis and I&#8217;m thinking how the accommodation at Inward Bound is probably going to be different from the slightly faded splendour of the hotel and I nearly tell Joe about what I&#8217;ll be doing while he is away. But then I can&#8217;t, I&#8217;m frightened to tell him straight and I get angry with myself and snap at him and Joe says what&#8217;s got into me and I can&#8217;t tell him and �. Oh, oh! This is all too complicated.


It&#8217;s OK in the end, though. And we manage a making-up shag! 

It all starts after lunch in the hotel when neither of us say very much and between us we finish a bottle of wine. When we get back to our room I say, �I&#8217;m sorry Joe, I didn&#8217;t mean to get mad.�

He says, �Don&#8217;t worry. Come here,� and takes me in his arms. He&#8217;s gentle but firm as he pulls me towards him. I always like it when he does that. My head fits on his shoulder perfectly. I nestle closer and kiss his neck. �That&#8217;s good,� he says. He&#8217;s just being nice but in my mind I&#8217;m hearing the words of a slave master. The only trouble is I want it to be Joe. 

�You know I only want to please,� I say, wishing that he would take me at my (unspoken) words.

�In which case, I&#8217;d better take you to bed,� he responds. He pulls off his shirt. I like his body. It&#8217;s fit; quite muscley. He smells sweet and musky. He takes my hand, steering me across the room. I let him lead me. As we fall on the bed I go to unfasten the belt of his trousers, it&#8217;s what a good slave girl would do, after all. Joe laughs as I fumble with it and says, �Here let me.� I can&#8217;t stop him. He unfastens it, unzips his trousers and pushes them off. I try to pull his boxers off. �No,� he says, smiling and trying to push my dress up, �let&#8217;s take yours off.�

We tumble together until I&#8217;m naked and so is he. We&#8217;re both laughing. Happy as kids. His hands are on my breasts, then sliding down around my waist, pulling me towards him. I&#8217;m kissing him. He&#8217;s kissing me.&nbsp; We&#8217;re both aroused and maybe a little drunk. He lays me back, kneeling between my parted thighs, his cock swollen and erect. He goes to pull on a condom but I distract him, reaching&nbsp; out towards his cock. �Its OK�, I say: �I&#8217;m safe just now.� Actually I don&#8217;t care if I am or not the way I feel at the moment. I reach out towards his cock but he takes my hands in his, lifts them to his lips and kisses them before he lays down on me, I&#8217;m giggling at his rather gentlemanly kiss; its more knightly and chivalrous than ravishment but then he kisses me on the neck, the ear and the lips and I feel his cock pressing up against me and the slipping inside.

He&#8217;s obviously enjoying himself. He&#8217;s stiffer, thicker, than he has been for quite a while. That arouses me more. I&#8217;m murmuring with pleasure and the murmuring gets louder and turns to more of a grunt. He likes that. He&#8217;s pushing into me, saying how much he loves me, how great it is to be in me, how hard I make him. My hands are on his back, my fingers digging into the muscles of his shoulders, squeezing him harder towards me. I&#8217;m gasping; the pleasure in my cunt; the feel of his body against mine; the closeness of the two of us. I wrap my legs around his bum, so he can&#8217;t get away. Can&#8217;t pull out. I want to feel him come inside me.

And then he comes, his words of love turning to grunts as he pulses into me. I&#8217;m not far behind him, my own cries merging with his as I press back at him, as if I could somehow prevent what I know must be the shrinking of his member. But then I&#8217;m there, squealing with delight as I gasp and groan into my own orgasm.

He rolls off me, laying back. I snuggle up against him. We lay together, cuddling, for what seems like hours. He gets up, pulls the bed coverings over me and walks across the room.

He&#8217;s in a reflective mood. �Are you happy Jen?� he says staring out of the hotel window across the windswept view of the bay.

�Mmm, of course,� I say. �Especially after that.�

�Not just shag happy,� Joe grins sitting down on the bed beside me. �Happy happy?�

�Of course.�

�It's just that, well, I don&#8217;t know, you&#8217;ve seemed a bit preoccupied. I know I get moody before these trips sometimes. I just wanted you to know it&#8217;s nothing you&#8217;ve done and I&#8217;m sorry if I&#8217;ve done anything to upset you. I know I can be a bit clumsy.�

�Like a bull in china shop?� I laugh and he joins in. �No, it&#8217;s OK. I&#8217;ve just got a project to work on while you&#8217;re away and it&#8217;s going to be quite difficult. And you&#8217;re going to be in the back of beyond and won&#8217;t be able to e-mail me and I won&#8217;t be able to speak to you. That&#8217;s the trouble really. Not enough time together.�

�You&#8217;ll handle it. I know it&#8217;s no good asking you about it; I don&#8217;t understand the psychobabble. I never got over that dinner with your professor where she managed to make all that kinky stuff sound so highbrow! But, you&#8217;ll handle it all right.�

�Was that dinner really so bad?�

�You know I can&#8217;t get enthusiastic about vegetarian food.�

I grab for a pillow and make as though I am going to hit him with it. �You know that&#8217;s not what I meant.� 

�Dawney&#8217;s got a different view of the world from me. She sees sex as something to analyse, part of some great transaction between the man and the woman, or in her case the woman and the woman. To me, it&#8217;s just something two people do because they want to or because they love each other or because they think it might be fun. All that analysis, classification, pigeon holing, labelling -&nbsp; what good does it do? And when she started to trot out that clap trap about - what did she call it? - &#8216;The psychodynamics of the dominant &#8211; submissive relationship&#8217; I thought &#8211; do me a favour, if that&#8217;s how people want to get their rocks off, why not just let them get on with it?�

And I almost bring myself to say, yes let&#8217;s. Right here. Right now. You and me. Fuck the psycho dynamics. Just fuck me. Fuck me again and fuck me hard and fuck me bareback and don&#8217;t be kind and friendly. 

But I don&#8217;t. And I don't know why.

And then, the moment is gone and he&#8217;s looking at his watch and saying, if I&#8217;m going to get a drink before dinner I&#8217;d better get in the shower right now.

I say, �Yes, Sir!� He grins. It&#8217;s the closest we get.

We&#8217;re back home. It&#8217;s two days later and Joe&#8217;s bag is packed. We've managed the last couple of days without the tensions coming back to the surface. The cab is waiting outside with its engine running.&nbsp; �Bye Jen,� he says and kisses me. �I&#8217;ll call if I can.�

I suddenly panic. If he does call, I won&#8217;t be here and I don&#8217;t even know if I&#8217;m going to be able to respond to e-mails. The Inward Bound site said things would be quite immersive and without contact with the outside world. �I know,� I say. �But I&#8217;m not going to be around much anyway. You know I said I have this project? It looks like I&#8217;ll be away from home quite a bit. The project has the people being studied isolated for observation, so we&#8217;ve banned mobile phones and PC&#8217;s from the site. So don&#8217;t worry if you don&#8217;t catch me, or I don&#8217;t get back to you. If there&#8217;s anything urgent, Dawney can probably track me down.�

Joe looks distracted. I don&#8217;t really think he&#8217;s taken this in. He grabs his coat. �Sure, hun, don&#8217;t worry. I&#8217;ll be back soon enough and we can do all our talking then. I&#8217;m going to be up country anyway and the communications are always dodgy. I&#8217;ll try to use e-mail.� 

�Keep safe, lover,� I say and kiss him back. I&#8217;m wondering if that will work either. Maybe I can get access to the Internet somehow.

�And, you too,� he says picking up his bag. And then he&#8217;s gone.

The phone rings. He&#8217;s hardly been gone five minutes and Angela is on the phone. It&#8217;s almost as if she were watching. �Jenny, how are you? Are you ready for your field-trip?�

Ready is probably not the word, but I&#8217;m as prepared as I can be. I&#8217;ve agreed with Angela that I&#8217;m not going to try to keep notes or write things up as it goes along. I can&#8217;t imagine that I&#8217;ll get much opportunity and I don&#8217;t really want to get caught with a notebook. I mean it&#8217;s not like I&#8217;ve told them that they&#8217;re my research project. 

The really important thing is to immerse myself in the experience, so I can understand how the stress of the adventure changes my reactions to what&#8217;s happening to me and those others I come up against. I&#8217;m going to have to work hard at making sure I commit to memory all my experiences, so I can write them up when I get back.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
�I guess so, Prof,� I say. �I&#8217;ve spent enough time telling my students that dispassionate observation is the key to ethnographic research. Now, I get to see if I can do it when I&#8217;m in the middle of it.�

�Well, I shall be away for a few days myself though I will be back just before you go and then I&#8217;ll be on the end of a phone if you need me. You&#8217;ve got that life line, if you need it. Although, as I said, I'd like to get the 10% discount back.�

Maybe she would, I think, but that was never going to be an issue with me. If I need to bail out, a few pounds more out of Angela Dawney&#8217;s endowment fund aren&#8217;t going to worry me.

There&#8217;s not much more I can do. All I know is that they'll contact me with my joining instructions and after that it's all a mystery. Two months of who knows what until I get back here again.

Two weeks later I am at home, on my own. My mobile phone pings to tell me a text has come in: �you&#8217;ve got e-mail� and when I open my inbox, there are my instructions. �.. Now, I know that it&#8217;s really going to happen. I really am on my way. 



Chapter 6:&nbsp;&nbsp; A Long &amp; Winding Road

Course 8 / Day 1: Course Progress Meeting

Josephine: All the team are briefed for today&#8217;s activities for the new Course 8 intake. There are five this time and they will arrive at the Centre around 19:00.

Jenny&#8217;s Recollections

Joe&#8217;s been gone for a couple of week. I&#8217;ve been working hard to prepare myself but now I&#8217;m sitting on the edge of the couch in the lounge at home staring at the papers I have just printed. I&#8217;m biting my lip and twisting a strand of hair between my fingers. Somehow, now that the time has arrived, it all seems a bit too real.

�Dear Jenny, here are your joining instructions,� the e-mail says. �Please follow them exactly in order to start your experience in the most successful manner. You will understand that an important part of your experience is concerned with receiving and following instructions. You should view this as the first part of that experience. Please do not bring any personal belongings with you apart from those items mentioned in this letter, you will not need them.�

Of course, it is what I had expected, but somehow it is still disturbing.

�Please do as follows:. Firstly, you are to take a shower and you will shave yourself. Dress in jeans, a tee-shirt and flip flops. Bring a towel and a swimming costume. Do not wear jewellery. Do not bring a mobile phone. You will need exactly �2.20 in coins. Do not bring money or credit cards. As a first step, you should go to the Sports Centre and swim. Be in the main pool at 11:30 exactly. You will receive further instructions there.� 

I take a shower, rummage in the wardrobe and put on my underwear. None of my jeans are clean, so I take a pair of linen trousers instead. A tee-shirt doesn&#8217;t really go with them, I think. So, instead, I pull on a white sleeveless top. As I put on a pair of sandals I think, �Well, it isn&#8217;t exactly what they&#8217;d asked, but it&#8217;s close enough.�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

Entry to the Sports Centre costs exactly �2.20 and, at 11:20, I am sitting on the edge of the pool, my feet dangling in the water. I look up at the large competition clock on the wall above the deep end of the pool. The minute hand clunks one step further towards half past eleven. As it clunks once more to eleven twenty seven I ease myself off of the poolside and into the water, setting out with a slow breast stroke for the middle of the pool. I roll over on to my back and kick a few times, pushing slowly up the pool. 

I roll over again and looked at the clock. Eleven thirty exactly. I am almost surprised that nothing happens. �But then,� I think, �they only said for me to be here at half past eleven.�

It is as I am wondering what to do next, that a woman surfaces beside me. �Hello, Jenny,� she says, and I know that things are starting. I don&#8217;t recognise the woman, even though she has recognised me. However, given that the woman is wearing a skin-tight white swim cap, goggles and a nose clip, it is hardly easy! �We need to swap keys: you have to give me your locker key,� the woman says.

Puzzled, I do as I am told.

�Thank you,� the woman says. �Now take mine.� She passes her own key over. �Stay in the pool another half hour. Then go and get changed into the clothes you&#8217;ll find in my locker. You&#8217;ll find your next instructions there too.� Without another word the woman swims away from me to the far side of the pool and pulls herself out. Picking a towel from one of the poolside couches, the woman walks away towards the changing rooms, wrapping the towel around herself. 

At twelve o&#8217;clock, I climb out of the pool wondering what the next step will be. I, too, grab a towel and head towards the changing rooms. Inward Bound is certainly setting the scene. I&#8217;m obviously going to have to get used to following instructions. It will be interesting to see how this conditioning affects the way that the stress of the situation builds up.&nbsp; 

As I take the woman&#8217;s things from the locker I find a pair of flip-flops, jeans and a white tee-shirt, exactly what I had been told to wear in the joining instructions. Well, as my jeans were not clean and as I did not know I would be swapping clothes anyway, I guess I made the right call to do as I did.&nbsp; There is no underwear here! Looking back, the letter had not said to wear a bra and pants, either.&nbsp; But then, I had not taken the note as literally as that. So I&#8217;m definitely sure I made the right call.&nbsp; There&#8217;s an envelope stuffed into the pocket of the jeans &#8211; and a mobile phone.

The note reads: �Hi, Jenny: Here is a mobile phone and we will be in touch with you soon. Meanwhile, you need to have your hair cut. You have an appointment at one o&#8217;clock with Isla at NX Hair in town. Ask her to give you a number four crew cut. And have another piercing put in your left ear.� 

I put my hand up to my left ear lobe. I haven&#8217;t worn earrings as the original note had said I shouldn&#8217;t wear jewellery, but I do have one piercing in either ear. I suppose that I&#8217;ve always thought anything more than that a bit unconventional, �But then,� I think, �what I&#8217;m doing is hardly conventional anyway. I&#8217;m not sure that I&#8217;ll go along with that though.�

I make my way out of the Sports Centre and off towards town. I am very conscious of the fact that I am naked beneath my tee-shirt, thinking that every man I pass must be staring at my nipples. The way that my jeans rub against my naked, shaved, crotch is even worse.

As I walk on, the mobile goes off.

�Jenny?� I don&#8217;t recognise the voice.

�Yes.�

�Hi. Are you on your way to NX?�

�Yes.�

�Good. The cut is on account and there is a message for you at reception. &#8216;Bye.� The phone goes dead, as whoever it was hangs up.

By the time I get to NX Hair, I am feeling discouraged and a little uncertain, but I overcome my fears and go in. �I&#8217;m Jenny McEwan� I say, �I&#8217;ve got an appointment at one o&#8217;clock. With Isla,�

�Oh yes. Take a seat,� the receptionist says.

Moments later a smiling, red headed girl appears, &#8216;Isla&#8217; is embroidered in red letters on her black, high necked shirt. �Come through,� she says waving to a seat at one of the sinks. �Cut and a piercing, wasn&#8217;t it?�

�Ah,� I say sheepishly, �I&#8217;ve changed my mind about the piercing, if that&#8217;s OK.�

�Of course,� Isla says. �Why wouldn&#8217;t it be? It&#8217;s your choice. Now, how about the cut. What did you have in mind?� Isla has picked up her electric clippers.

�Well, I wanted something shorter. With summer coming, I just need something easier to manage. Actually, something like yours would be good.�

�This isn&#8217;t all that short,� Isla replies.

�Well, it&#8217;s shorter than mine is now. I think it will look nice like that and it will be short enough for what I want.�

�OK,� says Isla, �let&#8217;s go with that.� She seems abrupt. I wonder how much of this has been all set up by Inward Bound, but I&#8217;m not all that brave at the hairdressers at the best of times. Isla sweeps a black sheet across me and goes to work washing the chlorinated water out of my hair before setting to with comb, scissors and clippers. It all feels odd to me, but it doesn&#8217;t take all that long and when Isla has finished combing and cutting I feel rather pleased with the result. 

I&#8217;m wondering what her next step will be, as Isla pulls the black sheet clear. �There you go,� Isla says.

I stand up. Isla is waiting, holding the sheet. �It&#8217;s on account,� I say, �it should have all been arranged.� Isla, evidently still hoping for a tip, looks across at the receptionist who pulls the earphones of her i-pod out of her ears.

�S&#8217;allright,� the receptionist says, dropping the copy of Hello! that she&#8217;d been reading. Isla looks maybe a bit disappointed, smiles and says she hopes to see me again before too long.

�Was there a message left for me?� I ask, beginning to get the hang of the game by now.

The girl appears to drag a faint memory from the depths of her consciousness. �Oh. Yes. Well there was this.� She pulls out another envelope. Inside is a note and a Travel Card good for a railway journey to London and the Underground. The note says �Warwick Station, London train 14:49� 

I get to the station with fifteen minutes to spare before the train. Thinking that I&#8217;ll pass the time with a cup of coffee, I almost get to the front of the queue in the station caf� before I realise that I have no money on me. Embarrassed I slip out of the caf�, feeling as though everyone is looking at me now, not just the men. I step back onto the platform.
 
I feel the mobile in my pocket and think at least I can report in to Angela. I dial her number. The phone replies that I need a top up. �Very clever, Inward Bound,� I think. �You&#8217;ve given me a pay-as-you-go phone with no money on it.� I can receive calls, but I can&#8217;t make them. I&#8217;ve been neatly tied to an electronic string�

The train carries me swiftly on to London and I spend the journey gazing out of the window. I&#8217;m feeling increasingly anxious as I am carried further and further away from home and safety.&nbsp; As the countryside begins to give way to the London suburbs I am startled by the mobile going off again.

�Hi, Jenny. You caught the train then.�

I&#8217;m startled. How does she know? Was there someone from Inward Bound at the station?&nbsp; Is there someone on the train watching me? 

�It sounds noisy.� Of course. She can hear that I&#8217;m on the train. �Anyway - more instructions! When you get in to Marylebone Station, I want you to go on to the Underground and go to Monument. Got that?�

�Yes,� I say, �and what then?�

But, by the time I ask the question, the caller has hung up.

I get to Marylebone Station and head for the Underground. The journey involves me my finding my way on to the Bakerloo line, to Embankment, changing and taking the Circle Line to Monument. As I emerge into the daylight, the mobile rings once more.

�Jenny?� It&#8217;s the same voice.

�Yes?�

�Not far now! Find Gracechurch Street, follow it into Fenchurch Street, and make your way to 
The Elephant. It&#8217;s up beyond Mincing Lane. On the left. Bye.�

A pub! That can mean food, drink and company. Things are looking up!

As I walk through the streams of City workers making their way home, I&#8217;m still anxious about being naked under my tee-shirt and jeans. But of course, they don&#8217;t really notice me. They&#8217;re all thinking about getting home. Comfortable, familiar, secure home. But what about me? I kept musing that as they journeyed to the security of home, I was on my way to a very different type of security!

Oh dear! I stop as I suddenly realise that I can see The Elephant. Just what is waiting for me only a few steps ahead?

 �The rest of you lot are in the function room,� the bar maid calls as I step into the almost empty bar. �It&#8217;s through there,� she nods. 

I go through to a room at the back to find four other girls dressed just like me. With them is Charlotte, whom I&#8217;d met after my initial enquiry, and a short black guy. He&#8217;s talking in an American accent to a rather fit looking guy that looks like he's taking time out from training for some sport or other.

�Hi, Jenny,� says Charlotte smiling, pushing a strand of her blonde hair back from her face, �glad you got here. How did you enjoy the journey?�

�Well, I guess it was an anxious trip,� I say. Laughter from the others suggests that anxiety has been a common experience. They all look to be about the same age as I am. There&#8217;s a mixture of shapes and sizes. A bunch of normal looking girls having a drink in a pub. Well what did I expect? If I&#8217;ve learned anything from my forays into the fetish scene it&#8217;s that you can&#8217;t tell that someone is into this just by looking at them.&nbsp; 

�Here, have a drink,� says Charlotte handing me a glass without asking me what I want. �It&#8217;s a good way to break the ice. This is Carrie, Sue, Anna and Judy.� She points to the other girls. �And these two are Gerry,� she points to the American. He returns a broad grin. �And, George.� George cheerily raises a hand. I see him smile, he's got a sort of Hugh Grant look about him, but tougher.

�Now,� continues Charlotte, �just a word to you five. This is your last chance to abort the mission.� She looks around at the four of us. Nobody says they want to bail out. The other four girls have got rather tense expressions. I guess I look the same. �OK,� Charlotte says, �so that&#8217;s us ready to roll.�

Gerry joins in, �the carriage awaits, duty and honour call us onward to our fate, so let&#8217;s go!�

The combination of the drinks and Charlotte and Gerry&#8217;s urgings mean that we get up in a more mellow frame of mind than we all probably arrived in, but I guess that the other four are still feeling as nervous as I am. Certainly none of us say anything as we follow Charlotte, George and Gerry to an NCP car park nearby. Gerry points out a smart Mercedes executive coach. �There you go, ladies,� he says jovially.
 
We take our seats and strap ourselves in. Still no one says anything. I guess we have all got used to following instructions on our journeys to London and now we wait for more. As we move off, things start to shift up a gear. 

Gerry is driving. George, sitting beside him, turns around in his seat.

�Now, ladies,� George begins, as the coach bumps out of the car park and into the late afternoon traffic, �you may have noticed that the coach has tinted glass so you will not be visible to passers by or other road users. We have to be a little confidential about our destination and maybe you all could use some sleep, so I think it would be a good idea for you to put these sleep masks on.� He passes them back to us. �You can make believe you&#8217;re in business class. The seats in this are just as good!� George is an effective salesman. We obey his request without question. 

A moment later, Charlotte comes to crouch down beside me. �It&#8217;s a good idea if you keep quiet for the ride,� she whispers. I feel her smooth a strip of tape across my lips. It&#8217;s just a small piece, and I guess I could easily dislodge it if I chose. It&#8217;s not exactly a gag, but it&#8217;s strongly symbolic. I hear her whispering the same thing to the girl next to me. I guess that she does the same to all of us. And then, Charlotte is back again to say softly �now don&#8217;t worry� before drawing my hands onto my lap and slipping handcuffs onto my wrists one on either side of the seatbelt lap strap.
 
So here we are, strapped into a strange car, blindfolded, gagged and handcuffed, all without protest. Ah the power of stress, hunger, alcohol and fatigue!&nbsp; And desire. After all, we&#8217;re all here because we want to be here.

Out of the car park and over the next ��hour, or was it two? We drive on heading for� where? Our fate I suppose, as Gerry had joked earlier. 

As the coach whirrs along my mind wanders to The Story of O, which I read years ago. It begins as O is driven through Paris with her lover, her naked buttocks against the seat of the taxi, while she sat there in gloves. I had found this first passage as arousing as anything in the book. Now, my own situation is not so different as I am driven through the English countryside, a restrained captive, made captive with my own consent.&nbsp; This, I feel is every bit as bizarre and what&#8217;s more it&#8217;s real.&nbsp; Damn, the effects of the drink are kicking in. I&#8217;m going to be desperate for a pee, if the journey goes on much longer!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

The slow stretching of my bladder begins to command my attention and the more it occupies my mind, the worse it becomes. Judging from the restless wriggling of my companions, the others are feeling the same!

Then, it&#8217;s Charlotte&#8217;s voice. �OK, girls I think we&#8217;ve got time for a comfort break. Does anyone want us to stop?� The chorus of �mmm&#8217;s� gives her the answer she expects. �Gerry,� she says. �Better pull off when you can.�

The coach stops. Charlotte takes our blindfolds off and releases our handcuffs, but not the tape across our lips. We get out to into the dusk on a lonely country road. It is silent and the trees all around cast deep pools of shadow.

�Just go on the grass,� Charlotte says, �You will all be OK. There shouldn&#8217;t be anyone around.�

I don&#8217;t make a habit of peeing in public places, but any port in a storm and it seems like we are miles from anywhere �..and oh the relief! - an emotion I could tell was fully shared by the others.

We get back in the coach and strap ourselves back in. Without being asked, we put our blindfolds back on. Charlotte slips the cuffs back on my wrists. �All ready, Gerry,� she calls and we move off. We resume our journey only to stop a few minutes later. The car makes a sharp turn and slows, turning this way and that until we can hear that we are driving on gravel. Finally, less than five minutes after our pee-break, we come to a halt. 

�It&#8217;s a pity you girls couldn&#8217;t hold on for a few more minutes,� George laughs.

We are taken out of the car again and the blindfolds come off. The tape stays across our lips and our hands are re-cuffed in front of us again. We stand on the drive outside a rather large house, surrounded by parkland, enveloped in the smells of a summer evening. 

As I walk past Charlotte, she is smirking and it seems to me that having the five of us relieve ourselves in the road has all been part of the script!

�OK girls,� says Charlotte again, �you have made it! You will get some supper. Next, you&#8217;ll get the chance to make your safe calls. After that, you&#8217;ll be taken to your rooms and given the chance to freshen up. Then, we&#8217;ll get you properly admitted. Welcome to Inward Bound.�

Chapter 7:&nbsp;&nbsp; Admissions Procedure


Course 8 / Day 1 Course Progress Meeting

Participant Notes: Fifty

Josephine: Fifty was somewhat surprised by her session with Celia after her admission, but took her initial challenge without protest. There is every sign is that she will quickly adapt to the Inward Bound regime. 


Jenny&#8217;s Recollections

We are taken into a rather well-appointed dining room. Our group of five is shown towards a separate table just for us. There are place cards at each seat with our names on. Mine has the number Fifty in brackets after it. The other girls all seem to have numbers beside their names too. No one explains what they mean. We&#8217;re left to sit ourselves down to eat. 

I&#8217;m trying to take it all on-board. Thinking about how I&#8217;m going to write this up for the research proposal.

Supper is on the table already, waiting for us. It&#8217;s fairly Spartan food and makes for an interesting contrast with our gracious surroundings. There&#8217;s a big bowl of muesli, a pair of stainless steel water jugs, a plate of oat cakes and another bowl filled with fresh fruit. We&#8217;ve each got a plastic beaker, a metal bowl and a plastic spoon. It&#8217;s all pretty basic, muesli with water, oatcakes, fruit and water to drink. This diet looks like it&#8217;s going to be good for us, if it goes on like this. One thing is certain; any spare fat will be history for me, if we eat like this for two months! 

Nobody comes to take the tape from our mouths. Carrie is the first one to peel it away and start spooning some muesli into her bowl. Her handcuffs clank against the metal bowl, as she reaches for one of the water jugs.

After the long journey and nothing to eat since breakfast, I am hoping for something, well, something more normal, and hot! Something like the richer and more indulgent meal being consumed by Charlotte, Gerry and George, at the next table &#8211; with wine! There are some none too subtle messages going out.

None of us say anything. I guess that the others are as nervous as I am. Having the tape and blindfolds on during the journey seems to have put us all into an introspective mood. I look around at the others. They all look about the same age as I am. Sue is maybe a few years older, a little more heavily built than the rest of us. Anna is quite tall and willowy; Judy slim, but with nicely prominent tits. One good thing; at least I&#8217;m not the only one that hasn&#8217;t had her hair clipped really short. Carrie has her hair done pretty much like mine. It&#8217;s such a beautiful auburn, I can see why she wouldn&#8217;t want to have it clipped. All the others do seem to have got their extra ear piercing, though. They all have a single gold stud in rather red looking ear lobes. 

At the other table �the Faculty�, as I&#8217;ve christened them to myself, are all chatting away; inconsequential stuff about the trip up, as far as I can tell.

Eventually the Faculty finishes, pushing away their plates, most of them leaving something. We&#8217;ve been waiting quite a while and even if we haven&#8217;t found it that appetising, we&#8217;ve managed to clear almost all of the food that they served up for us.

Two more Inward Bound staff arrive. One of them points at me and beckons me to follow her, out of the dining room along a corridor and down a flight of stairs of stairs to an office. She dials a number on the phone and hands the receiver to me. �Your safe call�, she says, �Just say you got here OK�. 

Eventually Angela&#8217;s voice mail picks up &#8211; it&#8217;s just as well that I&#8217;m not in any sort of jam! 

�Hi, Angela, it&#8217;s Jenny,� I say. �Just a quick call to say I got here safe and sound. I&#8217;m at �er�(I look down and realise that I can&#8217;t give Angela the number because there is no number on the phone) �at IWB. I am just checking in. &#8216;Bye.�

I hand the receiver back to the woman. As she takes it, I can see she is obviously very amused by my reference to �checking in�, as though I was at some grand hotel. Well, I&#8217;ll keep up appearances as long as I can.

We leave the office and further down the passage, get to what I guess is going to be my room, at least for tonight. 

I&#8217;m not sure that &#8216;room&#8217; is the right word.&nbsp; This is the first confirmation of what Charlotte had told me at the interview, �We try to push your limits and it can be quite demanding�. The room looks exactly like a prison cell. There are three solid walls, but the corridor wall is all bars, floor to ceiling.&nbsp; Inside I can see a couch with a blanket and towel folded up on it. There are en suite facilities, well sort of - a wash hand basin next to a French style squatting toilet with a shower head over the toilet tray. There&#8217;s one small window, barred of course, high in the outer wall. I presume it will admit daylight come tomorrow but there&#8217;s no way I can reach it so there won&#8217;t be much of a view. Maybe clouds if I&#8217;m lucky.

My escort engages in a real conversation for the first time. �Fifty, I&#8217;m your trainer and my name is Josephine,� she says. �You can call me Jo,� I hadn&#8217;t been expecting to be allowed such familiarity, �except when I tell you otherwise.�

�Pardon?� I say. �What&#8217;s with the &#8216;Fifty&#8217;? My name&#8217;s Jenny.�

Jo shakes her head. �No. Not here. Slaves have numbers, not names. You have left Jenny behind. As long as you are here, you&#8217;re &#8216;Fifty&#8217;. See, here&#8217;s your number on the door. Still, Jen-ny; Fif-ty &#8211; your number&#8217;s not far away from your old name!�

Jo waves me into the cell and takes off my handcuffs. �OK Fifty, get undressed, please, and have a shower and there&#8217;s a tooth brush by the basin. Be sharp!�

Her snapped instruction spurs me to action. I guess if I&#8217;m going to be a slave, I&#8217;m going to have to get used to doing as I&#8217;m told. The numbers thing is hardly a surprise but it certainly adds to the stress. I&#8217;ll have to think to remember my number. I can imagine there will be penalties for not responding when I&#8217;m called. This could be a focus for some of the research. How people respond to having their identities re-assigned and to what extent their behaviour changes as a result of changes in the way that they are identified.&nbsp; 

Of course, there are not many clothes to struggle out of, just the tee-shirt and jeans.&nbsp; I stand with my feet on the footpads of the toilet. The shower controls are within easy reach. The water cascades down over me, into the toilet pan and away down the drain. It&#8217;s very efficient. In short order, I&#8217;m washed, dried and my teeth are cleaned. I turn around to see that Jo has swept the clothes into a bag.

�Very good, Fifty,� she says. �The next job is to have you collared and cuffed. If you wondered why we wanted measurements of your neck, wrists and ankles, here is why.� She snaps five bands on me. They are flat polished metal and lined with black rubber and clip efficiently into place. �And, that&#8217;s you done for now,� says Jo.

�What about clothes?� I say, conscious that Jo is picking up the bag containing my tee-shirt and jeans.

�Clothes?� Jo seems genuinely puzzled, as though I&#8217;d asked for something extraordinary.

�Yes. I wondered what it was that you wanted me to wear.�

At this point, Jo breaks out laughing. �No, no clothes for you, Fifty. You didn&#8217;t follow your first instruction, did you?� I guess that my confusion shows on my face. �You know. About what you were told to wear in your Joining Instructions?�

�But �,� I start to try to explain, but Jo presses her finger against my lips.

�Shhhh!� she says gently. �It doesn&#8217;t matter why. These things happen, but the why never matters. We just think that the best way to help you avoid similar mistakes is to keep you completely naked throughout your time with us. All slaves get to go naked at some stage; it&#8217;s just that you will get to be naked right from the start. You might even get an all-over tan, if the weather is good. Well, apart from your neck, wrists and ankles.� She laughs again. �Enjoy!�

She stands back and slides the cell door closed with a clang. It seems to lock automatically.

And there I am, left all alone and wondering just what I have got myself into.
 
Another of the staff appears outside my room. She is tall with red spiky hair and blue eyes. She wears blue scrubs and white surgical clogs &#8211; and speaks with a lilting South African accent. It&#8217;s as if a member of the cast from �ER� has just walked onto the set.

She has all the breezy confidence of a doctor or a nurse. �Hi Fifty, just stand back and I&#8217;ll let myself in,� she says as she swipes a card through a card reader outside my �room�. 

The door unlatches and she enters, carrying what looks like the sort of utility box you can buy at Mother and Baby stores. She sets the box down on my bed and opens it to show various sterile packets.

�OK, Fifty. I&#8217;m Celia. I&#8217;m here to teach you a bit about personal hygiene.�

�Hygiene? But I&#8217;ve only just had a shower and ���

Celia is laughing, hands on hips. �No, Fifty. Internal hygiene, silly.�

Internal hygiene? What is the girl talking about &#8211; oh, but wait a minute, I have just cleaned my teeth, so she cannot be interested in teeth �..

�Fifty, when was the last time you went for a crap?�

I&#8217;m not really happy talking about this sort of thing, not even - especially not even - with Joe. I blush and fall over my words.

�Hmmm, well whenever it was, I bet you didn&#8217;t really clean yourself out, inside. Did you? Well, you see, Fifty, slaves have got to look after themselves inside and out. Owners expect it. And you are going to start doing it. Now, on your knees, over there, by the toilet.�

Celia&#8217;s not expecting any arguments and I&#8217;m going redder by the second. Obeying seems best, but surely �� surely not �..

I am facing away from my bed, but can clearly hear the sound of some of the packs being opened and then I feel Celia rubbing something on my anus. She is wearing rubber gloves. Instinctively, I clench my buttocks, and get a sharp slap on my bum for my pains &#8211; which really stings.

�Fifty ��!�

I&#8217;m sorry, it&#8217;s just �� well it&#8217;s just ��.

�You&#8217;re not used to having an enema?�

OH! Jeeze! OH! 

�Er, well no. I&#8217;m just not. Sorry. It&#8217;s � I �..�

�Well, it will be another first for you. And, I&#8217;m sure you will get used to it just fine. Now. I&#8217;m going to do the first one with you and I&#8217;m going to watch you do another one right after me. After that, And we will go on doing them till I&#8217;m happy you can do it. Then it will be down to you to clean yourself out daily. Got that?&nbsp; We&#8217;ll check, hmmmmm?�

�Oh, �..�

�No, the right answer is: &#8216;Thank You Mistress!&#8217;�

�Oh, look I&#8217;m sorry, err it&#8217;s just well, I&#8217;m just not used to �.�

But Celia is laughing and somehow that&#8217;s encouraging, but gee! High&nbsp; cringe&nbsp; factor, as far as I&#8217;m concerned.

Celia again: �So here&#8217;s what you are going to do. Put some warm water in this metal bowl &#8211; warm, NOT hot. Still as its going inside you, I guess I don&#8217;t need to labour that.� She fills a metal bowl from the hose tap next to my toilet. �Next, you fill this enema syringe like this?&nbsp; Now you &#8211; come on, it doesn&#8217;t bite.�

I reluctantly take hold of the very large metal syringe. The business end is about as wide as a finger and rounded at the open end.
 
�Now, I have lubed your anal bud, so take the syringe to your rear end &#8211; yes like that &#8211; feel it on your bud &#8211; do you feel it?�

�Yes, Celia.� I&#8217;m horrified by the whole process, by what she&#8217;s doing and by the fact that she&#8217;s there watching.

�OK. So now, we gently push it in. Make as if you are having a crap. Are you? Would another slap help?� I shake my head. It&#8217;s the last thing I want right now. �AHHH, there you go!�

The syringe feels cold and slippery �. but finally, it&#8217;s in up to the hilt, so to speak. A cold, rigid, finger up inside me.

�Now squeeze the plunger with your other fingers.�

I&#8217;ve got my forehead resting on the floor, knees apart, bum in the air, one hand on the barrel of the syringe and one hand free to squeeze �.. the water as it enters me is warm and comforting. I must have sighed with relief, because Celia replies with the well worn medical clich�, �There, that wasn&#8217;t so bad, now was it?�

No, it isn&#8217;t, except for my pride. But then perhaps the demolition of personal pride and self consciousness is one of the things I am going to be learning?

�OK. Now squeeze your bum tight shut. Slide the syringe out.� It&#8217;s a curious, slippery sensation as it comes away. �And get over the loo.� Anxiety must be showing on my face because Celia answers my unspoken fears. �Don&#8217;t worry, you won&#8217;t leak if you squeeze tight!�

I squeeze. Boy, do I squeeze!

�Now you are over the loo, Just let go ���

A stream of water&nbsp; - and other material pours out of me. Yeuch! This is so embarrassing! But, not so embarrassing as to prevent Celia making me go through the whole thing four times, till at last the water coming out of me is clear. We watch it passing across the toilet pan tray and down the drain.

�Now, that&#8217;s better, Fifty!� I will expect you to do that every day and after clean the kit afterwards. You keep it in this box.� She motions to the utility box. �It&#8217;s got to be spotless. Absolutely spotless. Always. You got that?�

�Yes, Celia. Sorry! Mistress.�

�Good girl!� She strips off her gloves and discards them along with the sterile wraps into the flip top stainless steel waste bin in the corner of my room. �Right: now go and wash your bum and hands and clean your teeth, if you haven&#8217;t done that already. I&#8217;ll leave that to you. Then it&#8217;s bed time.�

Celia reaches through the bars and swipes her card to gain her exit. I watch as she leaves. It&#8217;s been an oddly �veterinary� incident, leaving me feeling slightly less than fully human, somehow. I mean having someone else telling me how to look after myself, as if I could not be trusted on my own �..

�Stand away from the bars,� she tells me, as she reaches out to press a button on the wall beside the door. There is a quiet whir as an aluminium mesh shutter starts to slide down on the outside of the bars, cutting me off from the rest of the room. It eventually reaches the floor and a clunk announces that it, too, has locked into place. I am left completely alone, taken aback, indignant and shivery. I lay down on the couch. The surface is wipe-clean PVC, but at least there is a cotton cellular blanket. Shortly afterwards, the light goes out. It&#8217;s very dark. The only light is a tiny red LED glowing up in the ceiling. 

I am left alone to mull over the past few hours; the journey, the other girls, the &#8216;Faculty&#8217;, being collared and cuffed, being given a number, and then the humiliation of the enema. It&#8217;s odd. I&#8217;m here partly because Joe and I are not as complementary as I&#8217;d like us to be sexually and I am going to be trained by a girl called, Jo. Strange. Then I think, how will I explain this to Joe when I get back? Suntanned, but with white marks on my wrists and ankles and neck? I&#8217;ll have to think of something, though heaven knows what. But what would he feel if I just told him the truth?


Finally I find myself thinking about my safe call to Angela. I really wish that I could have spoken to her in person but I wasn&#8217;t surprised to get her voice mail. Also, I would have felt happier if I could have given an actual number. Do they allow the transmission of their number on outgoing calls? I called Angela&#8217;s university direct dial line. Does the university exchange record incoming numbers? That way, she can get the number. Could someone pick out the Inward Bound number from all the thousands which might be logged? 

Suddenly, as thought piles on thought, worry on worry, there&#8217;s a cold stab of panic in my stomach. I could be much more exposed and alone than I thought. Anxiety churns in my mind. I try to calm myself, thinking back to the project working out how I am going to describe this; trying to think how I can separate my responses from my observations; what it might mean for the research. It&#8217;s a good distraction. At last I am overtaken by sleep.



Chapter 8:&nbsp;&nbsp; A Problem With Puppy Fat

Course 8 : Day 2 Course Progress Meeting

Participant Notes: #50

Josephine: The first part of #50&#8217;s induction this morning should not present any serious problems. George and I will take care of her initial physical with the others. We&#8217;ll start with the standard introduction to the weight loss/ fitness programme and make an assessment of what she might need during the rest of her course.&nbsp;&nbsp; 

Jenny's Recollections 

Well it&#8217;s started. I&#8217;ve been anticipating and also dreading this for quite a while and now we&#8217;re off. After the tension of yesterday&#8217;s events, the worry about what would happen, the &#8211; yes &#8211; the stress of it all, it was quite a relief to be left alone in my&nbsp; - ah - room. I worried myself asleep thinking about my safe call &#8211; I would have felt a lot happier, if I had been able to speak to Angela in person.&nbsp; Anyway, when sleep finally came, I stayed asleep until the lights came on and the shutter went up.&nbsp; 

First thing this morning, we are all collected together and taken to a gym. I&#8217;m feeling really screwed up with embarrassment, being naked because of not following instructions! I feel fee so stupid! Completely humiliated! It&#8217;s a new building on the other side of a small courtyard just across from the building where we were kept last night. It&#8217;s awful having to go outside between the two buildings to feel the cool air on my naked skin for the first time.&nbsp; 

The gym is pretty well equipped. There are six treadmills, six cross-trainers and a serious collection of free weights, together with weights benches and some other weight training machines. I&#8217;ve never been much into keeping fit. The university has a gym, but I never really find time to use it. This stuff looks quite scary! Thinking back to why I am here, I can see that there would be plenty of opportunities to study a mixture of stress and play in here.

On the plus side, there&#8217;s also what looks like a rather nice pool which connects through a tunnel to an outdoor pool extension.

Jo and George tell us all to strip. I&#8217;m naked already along with Sue. Thank goodness I have a partner in crime, so to speak. We exchange a smile, recognising our shared mistakes. I can see that Sue is a few years older than me. She&#8216;s built more heavily than I am. She&#8217;s a bit overweight if I&#8217;m honest. What she does have is a great pair of breasts. I&#8217;ve always felt that mine were too small, Sue&#8217;s are substantial with large dark aureolas. Suddenly I&#8217;m conscious that I&#8217;m staring at them. She returns my look and grins. I guess we all know why we&#8217;re here.&nbsp;&nbsp; 

The other three are wearing grey track suits and one of them, Carrie, doesn&#8217;t like being ordered to undress. They ignore her objections and eventually she complies. Their whole approach is very matter-of-fact, assuming we&#8217;ll do as we are told, treating us as so many units needing to be processed. It&#8217;s all very impersonal, but not much worse than trying to check out a book at the university library!

We get weighed, measured and have the thickness of our skin folds measured with some distinctly aggressive looking callipers. They look nasty, but they don&#8217;t hurt. In fact, the sensation is on the pleasant side of strange. Jo and George note down the results without commenting on any of them. They just wave us to come with a click of the fingers, or wave us away as they need us for each stage of the process.
 
It&#8217;s only when they have obviously got all the details that they want, that George goes out with all the notes and Jo takes some time to explain what they are doing. She has us line up against the wall, facing out with our hands on our heads. �There are two things you need to be aware of as a slave. One, are you fit enough for the things you&#8217;ll have to do? And, two, do you look the way your owners &#8211; that&#8217;s us &#8211; want you to? We&#8217;re going to make sure you measure up on both counts. You all probably know about having your Body Mass Index worked out from your height and weight. However, muscle weighs more than fat and BMI becomes less accurate the more fat you lose and the more muscle you put on. At that point, it&#8217;s better to measure skin fold thickness and look up your Body Fat Percentage. For you girls, we are aiming for 20% of your weight as fat. That will let your muscles show through with lots of sexy definition. We like lean, well-muscled, slaves who look nice and are fit and strong. Unfortunately, this can&#8217;t be achieved in the time you have with us, but you are going to get a flying start and we&#8217;ll take you as far as we can - so there will be homework for you after you are discharged. We WILL be checking up on you after you get home, just so when you come back you won&#8217;t have to start from scratch. ����..�

Homework? Checking up on us? When we come back!?? Gosh, I had not expected that!&nbsp; It&#8217;s beginning to feel like being in the grip of some sort of secret society. Perhaps we are. But are they really serious? Best not ask, just keep my eyes and ears open. I need to try to remember all this for my thesis anyway. It certainly ups the stress levels, the way in which they assume they are in complete control of every aspect of our lives. But then, thinking about it, they are.

George comes back carrying a box which he places on the table at one end of the gym. One by one, he points to each of us and beckons for us to come forward.

First we get a rubber chest strap, which fits just beneath our breasts. This is part of a heart rate monitor and the monitor goes on our wrists. They are obviously taking care of us. Second, we&#8217;re told to put on a rubber G-string, which is pleasantly firm. Third, we get what looks like a swimming costume for each of us. It almost feels odd to have clothes on again.

George explains that these are �triathlon suits�. Mine fits firmly rather than tightly and it&#8217;s definitely snug between the legs on top of the rubber G-string but it&#8217;s not uncomfortable.

Once we&#8217;ve all got our suits on and we&#8217;re standing in a line across the gym&nbsp; - hands on our heads again - Jo begins to work her way along the line. She gives each of us a belt, which locks around the waist. There is a pouch, or a pocket at the back which I guess in normal circumstances would be for a sports drink bottle, but for us looks like it contains some sort of box. We can&#8217;t open the pocket. Jo takes a wire which issues from the pocket and pushes it through a small zip opening in the back of our suits to plugs it into some sort of connector on the back of the G-string. What&#8217;s that all about? Some other sort of monitor?

�OK, girls,� George calls us to order. �Slaves have to be fit and so we are going to begin to change the habits of a lifetime for some of you.� George looks across at the slightly overweight Sue. �You are all going to get a daily work out. We will always start with an aerobics session. We are going to keep you at your optimum heart rate for �fat burn�.&nbsp; But to help you do the best you can, as it were, your kit will deliver a little added incentive ����

George presses a button on what looks like a small TV remote. Carrie immediately yelps and rubs her crotch, as if she has been stung. George continues, �Your G-strings are made from an electroconductive rubber. It runs, as you can feel, rather snugly between your legs, over your anus and between your labia. If you do not keep up with the treadmill settings, or the supervisor thinks you are giving less than 100 % - well Fifty-two?�

�It really stings!� Carrie looks upset at being chosen as the guinea pig for this particular demonstration. 

�Yep,� George smiles, �it really stings and will go on stinging until you catch up and or start doing your best!

The juice comes from the power packs on your belts, so you are carrying the means to maintain your own discipline. OK, enjoy your session. Jo will look after you!�

George&#8217;s lecture leaves me feeling �� feeling, surprisingly, not surprised.&nbsp; I&#8217;m actually intrigued by the ingenuity Inward Bound is showing and glad that we&nbsp; - well, I - am going to be pushed and kept up to the mark. It&#8217;s all rather delicious and another interesting example of stress for me to remember. I must be crazy. In fact, I definitely am crazy, because I start to get wet between my legs. That, of course, is making for better electrical contact and I start to get even more wet at the idea of that. Yes, definitely crazy. In fact, certifiable.

George hands the remote to Jo, who takes each of us across to one of the treadmills. She goes along the line setting us off. She presses the �custom� button and the inclination of my machine rises and the treadmill&#8217;s belt begins to move. The display reads, �Inclination :&nbsp; 2%. Speed : 5 kph�, so its just a steady walk for now. I cast a glance to the others &#8211; we are not all doing the same, so the settings must have been made with some reference to what we said about ourselves on our application forms to join the course. 

After about a minute the treadmill speeds up. Every minute the speed rises again and every alternate minute, the incline increases until I&#8217;m walking at 6 kph on an incline of 5.5%. After 25 minutes the calorie counter tells me I have burned through the thick end of 300 calories, but now I&#8217;m starting to get tired. It&#8217;s not just me. Anna glances round and finds Jo with her back turned. She presses the speed control on her treadmill to reduce the speed only to find her G-string immediately delivers a sharp sting. She cries out and Jo is at her elbow at once.

�Getting tough?�

�Yes, Mistress. Please can you give me a break. I&#8217;m still stinging!� I&#8217;m surprised that she wants to quit. She doesn&#8217;t look much less fit than I am and while I&#8217;m tired, I can take this so far. I&#8217;m also surprised that she says �Mistress�. Well, not so surprised, I suppose, but it&#8217;s the first real acknowledgement of the �traditional� relationship between Doms and subs in a BDSM relationship. I mean, I know I&#8217;ve been handcuffed and stripped and collared and numbered and all, but somehow hearing Anna say that out loud makes it all the more real. 

�OK, Twenty-four, stand on the side of the mill and come off for a moment &#8211; you others keep going EXACTLY as you are.� We all keep on walking but we&#8217;re all watching what is going to happen to Anna too.

Jo slows the treadmill to a stop and lets Anna dismount.

Jo says, �Twenty-four, slaves have to learn obedience. Would you like six of the crop across your bum as a break from the treadmill?�

�Yes, Mistress. Please.�

We can follow proceedings because they are reflected in the floor-to-ceiling mirrors which line one of the walls of the gym. It&#8217;s the first time there has been any suggestion of punishment and while I knew that it was going to be part of things here &#8211; actually, I think part of me has been looking forward to that if I&#8217;m honest. &#8211; Nevertheless, I suppose I&#8217;m surprised by how casually it is being viewed as part of the normal state of affairs by Jo, how ready Anna is to accept it, and how captivated all of us slaves are by the spectacle, even as we carry on jogging to keep up with our machines. 

Jo delivers six strokes at one stroke every 30 seconds. Quite hard. Anna struggles to keep still and after the sixth, Jo springs her trap.

�Now, Twenty-four, back on the treadmill.�

�Mistress?� There&#8217;s a catch in Anna&#8217;s voice that tells us that she wasn&#8217;t expecting that at all.

�Yes?�

�But you said ��

�No, you thought a spanking was an alternative; I said it was a break. I prefer it to be an extra encouragement. You have had your break. Now it&#8217;s got to be paid for. Back on the treadmill!�

Jo fires the remote and Anna yelps. Immediately, she is back on the machine and jogging to keep up with it.

�Funnily enough, Twenty-four, you only had a couple of minutes to go anyway, so let&#8217;s give you another �.five.

Eventually, five sweating slaves, all breathing heavily are allowed to step back onto firm ground to listen to another short lecture from Jo. �This programme is going to be about losing weight and gaining fitness. It is really very straightforward: eat less, work more! We want you to lose fat, but gain muscle. The safe rate of fat loss is about a half kilo per week. We are going to take you through that by giving you 500 calories less each day than you need to maintain your present body composition. We will feed you 250 calories less and make you work 250 calories more, which of course adds up to 500.&nbsp; Simple. We will do treadmill work one day and weights the next day and every fifth day you get a rest day. Any questions?�

Nobody says anything. I think we&#8217;ve all come to conclusion that least said is soonest mended when the Inward Bound staff are around. Jo looks around at the five of us. She&#8217;s obviously sat through enough of these sessions to know what&#8217;s going through our minds.
 
�No? Fair enough. Don&#8217;t always be so quiet though, sometimes it might pay you to speak out.� I look at the others. They are all wearing rather impassive expressions. I don&#8217;t get the impression that they believe her. I don&#8217;t either. Jo continues, �Well, go wash your kit and then you can have 15 minutes in the pool and admire Twenty-four&#8217;s bum. Let me see.� Jo beckons Anna towards her and instructs her with a spin of a finger to peel off her kit and turn around. �Hmmm not bad. You won&#8217;t enjoy sitting on that for a while, girl. Oh, by the way.� She turns back towards us. �The rest of you girls take note. It will be harder for the next one of you that tries to wriggle out of hard work!�

Now that, I do believe, because anyone could tell that Jo had obviously enjoyed herself. But then, there is the luxury of the pool. The water is warm, but not too warm and the feeling as it slips up across my naked body is wonderful. I strike out from the side and the water streams between my legs and around my breasts. Ah, if only I could start every day like this. Could Joe and I find somewhere to go in the summer where we could swim naked: just us two �?

We are each taken back to our cells for breakfast. I say �breakfast� - it&#8217;s not much given how hard we&#8217;ve been working, but I guess that is the idea. It&#8217;s served on a tray pushed through a gap at the foot of the bars that close off my cell. There&#8217;s fruit, a high fibre cereal bar and some water. The fruit and the cereal bar are in a metal dog&#8217;s bowl. The water is in a bottle with a sports cap. I can&#8217;t get the top off. Sitting, naked, on the floor of my cell, eating out of the dog bowl, and sucking on the water bottle I feel very different from the person that started out to the Sports Centre yesterday.&nbsp; I wonder how different I&#8217;ll feel by the end of the day, the end of the week, the end of this whole programme? 

Never mind coming up with a research agenda; how is this going to affect me?

Suddenly, it seems like a long time to give myself over to these people. On the other hand, while I&#8217;ve got over the sensation of having the tight rubber strap between my labia lips and the thrill from the threat of the shocks, I&#8217;m sill feeling quite turned on by the whole situation. In fact, thinking about it I&#8217;ve felt this sort of low level arousal all the time I&#8217;ve been here. It&#8217;s like the background radiation in the universe; not very energetic, but there all the time everywhere. In some ways it&#8217;s quite tiring, in others quite relaxing. I feel abstracted, somehow, as if I&#8217;m not quite in the real world. (Well, maybe I&#8217;m not.) Is that a response to the stress of the situation? I guess I need to think about that. Although, I must confess, analytical thought is proving a bit difficult when the main recollection of the morning is how you felt with the threat of a shock in the pussy, if you dared to stop jogging! So, I&#8217;ll keep remembering what I can and I&#8217;ll try to work out the meaning later.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 


Chapter 9:&nbsp;&nbsp; Bad Hair Day

Course 8 / Day 2: Course Progress Meeting

Participant Notes: Fifty

Jo: Fifty will be a stretched by her encounters today. Everyone, please be aware of this, if you have any contact with her after her sessions this morning or afternoon, please refer to Gerry or Celia in order to check on how her sessions went.&nbsp; 


Jenny&#8217;s Recollections

I&#8217;ve got over the exercise session and I&#8217;ve finished breakfast. Jo appears.&nbsp; I&#8217;m handcuffed and taken out of my room.

As I am led through the building I see some of the other girls hard at work cleaning and tidying. I pass Judy. She&#8217;s on her knees, wearing some sort of grey track suit. She&#8217;s scrubbing at the floor. She looks up as I go by and I see she&#8217;s been gagged with a bright red ball. Jo tells her to keep busy and Judy responds with a �Hnng Hnngstregh� which I take to mean �Yes, Mistress.�

I wonder if something like that will be done to me. I suppose so. Suddenly I&#8217;m feeling confused. All this time I&#8217;ve been thinking about the course and I&#8217;ve no real idea what is actually going to be involved. I look back over my shoulder as I follow Jo along the corridor. Judy is working hard. She looks up again as we reach the corner. I can&#8217;t tell if she&#8217;s unhappy about what she&#8217;s doing or if she&#8217;s enjoying it. Maybe she doesn&#8217;t even know herself. I&#8217;m in two minds about most of what&#8217;s happened so far.

Jo takes me to see the genial and enthusiastic black American who was on the coach with us yesterday.&nbsp; As soon as he speaks, I think he could double for Eddie Murphy. �Hi, Honey. Nice to see you again. For now, just call me Gerry,� he says.

Why is it that if you have a bunch of Americans, there&#8217;s always one called Gerry? And of course, he calls me &#8216;Honey&#8217;. 

I&#8217;m still standing in the doorway.

�Well, come on in Honey. Come on in and sit right down!�

�Do I have a choice?� I&#8217;m finding the combination of his polite tone and the fact I&#8217;m handcuffed confusing, to say the least.
 
He laughs. �Gee, you Brits are all so droll. Nope, you ain&#8217;t got no choice at all. And, to make sure you stay put, you get strapped to the chair here, too.� 

So, he takes my cuffs off and clips each wrist to the chair. The chair is comfortable and heavy. As Gerry would say, the chair and I weren&#8217;t goin&#8217; no place.

He stands back and looks at me. It&#8217;s a curious stare, appraising but not sexual.

�Hmmm, so you just startin&#8217; out here, Hon?� 

�Yes, that&#8217;s right; I arrived here, er, yesterday, I think.� What am I thinking? He knows exactly when I got here. He was in the bus with all of us.
 
I have no watch &#8211; they said not to bring one -&nbsp; and there&#8217;s no clock in my room. Room? Actually cell, I guess, but I can&#8217;t quite bring myself to say that. I feel a bit embarrassed to be here. Now that is incongruous! Worrying about being here, when maybe I should be more worried about the fact that I&#8217;m naked and restrained in a chair. I have not been given any clothes, save for a collar which has been locked around my neck and bands around my wrists and ankles. The collar has a dog tag style ID disc which apparently says I&#8217;m Fifty. Number Fifty, I hope. Not age Fifty!

Gerry brings me back to the present. �OK baby: this is going to be a fun day for you. This is make-up time!� He takes a comb and draws it through my hair. �Say, weren&#8217;t you supposed to get this cut before you got here? Make your hair manageable?�

�Well, yes I did. It&#8217;s much shorter, it&#8217;s&nbsp; �����

Gerry interrupts, �Uh uh, no you didn&#8217;t, Hon. WE said ask for a number 4 buzz cut and you asked for a trim. Right?�

�Well, yes. I just thought a crew cut might be a little on the short side.�

�On the short side?? Gee, I just love the way you Brits talk about a crew cut. So navy! Well, babe, the thing is &#8211; do you read?� Gerry is looking really inquisitive now.

�Read?�

�Yeah, read, as in books?�

�Well, yes. I work at a university. Books are us!� Immediately, I worry about my flippant remark and how he will take it. 

�Works at a university!� Gerry furrow his brow. �Well, I just wondered if you had done any reading �. about DS relationships and how when the Master speaks to the slave what the slave is supposed to do is to just go and do ?�

�Well, yes. I suppose I, I didn&#8217;t know how literally to take things.�

�Literally???? You take literal things literally! Look, Babe: one thing we are going to teach you here is obedience. Obedience means doing what the master says, when he says it. Got that?�

�Yes, thank you.�

�OK, tell you what. As this is your first full day and all, I&#8217;m going to go easy on you. You&#8217;ll sure get to learn this obedience thing. Now jus&#8217; let me see this hair of yours.� He peers intently, then scoops up some hair with his comb and fans it out. �Uh uh: not good Lady. You&#8217;ve got split ends here. You do not look after your hair. I&#8217;m going to cure all of that. Right now! And, more than that &#8211; I&#8217;m going to make you one beautiful gal. See her?�

He leans a photo on the mirror in front of me.

�This is Miss Ramatoulaye Diallo. The Face of Africa 2001. Senegal&#8217;s Finest.�

A statuesque young lady (girl is not appropriate for her) gazes at me from the photograph. She is very African and very beautiful. Outstandingly beautiful. I look more closely. She smiles and shows wonderfully even white teeth �.. Oh! Oh! Oh! �.. I suddenly feel cold and very heavy in my tummy. Her head is shaven . Completely. Realisation! Gerry is going to shave me bald! It&#8217;s as if there is telepathy between us.

�You ready now, lady?�

I have lost the power of speech.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t even try to struggle on the chair. He picks up a pair of electric clippers and begins. First, at the back of my head. I can feel the cold buzzing metal of the blade. Then the right side. Then the left. Then, finally from my forehead back to the crown. I open my mouth to speak, but still no words come out. I&#8217;m completely without hair. I do not recognise the face looking back at me in the mirror any more. 

And he still isn&#8217;t finished.

The breezy banter continues to pour out of him as he picks up an electric razor this time and works the foil progressively down from the crown of my head, like peeling an apple from the top. Then he works gently upward from the periphery to the crown.

Finally, the massacre of my lovely hair is over . Nothing &#8211; nothing is left.

�There, lady. What&#8211;do-you-think-of-that????? Let me tell you, you got one cute scalp.�

Think? I can only feel. Cold and sick. What ever possessed me to put myself in the hands of these people?
 
Gerry rounds off his assault by rubbing some sort of moisturiser into my distinctly pink scalp. His hands and warm and the cream seems slightly warming in itself.

�Trouble with you whiteys is, that you have such pink scalps when they get to see the light of day! You&#8217;ll look a whole lot better when you get some tanning up there. To hurry up the improvement some, I&#8217;ve just given you a good rubbing with self tan.&nbsp; Come to think of it, you could use self tan all over.� For the first time, I&#8217;m conscious that he&#8217;s looking at my naked body. �You ever been to a bodybuilding competition?�

�No,� I say, weakly.

�Y&#8217;know you should go! I always think those muscular girls look so beautiful. Anyway, they all get pretty smart at the self tan &#8211; I&#8217;ll get it written into your programme. What do you think?�

�Thank you, Gerry,� seemed the safest reply.

�Well, guess I&#8217;ll let you run along now and get yourself a coffee. Try strong and black. And remember next time: an order is an order!�

Gerry reaches down and unclips my wrists from the chair. I put my hands up to my scalp and it feels strange. Gerry watches as I touch it and then takes my hands and locks my cuffs back together. I look at him in surprise. �You got a problem with that?� he says. �You can get a coffee with your bracelets joined up, can&#8217;t you?�

�Yes, Gerry,� I say.

�Great,� he says.

As I emerge from Gerry&#8217;s room I pass Carrie being led unwillingly along the corridor. She looks at my shaved head in shock, I look at her auburn hair and I can guess what&#8217;s about to happen. So doe she as she is hustled into Gerry&#8217;s room!&nbsp; 


Chapter 10: Piercing Questions 

Course 8 / Day 2: Course Progress Meeting

Participant Notes: Fifty

Jo: When Gerry has finished with Fifty, she has a session booked with Celia. This is likely to challenge Fifty more than anything else so far.&nbsp; 

Jenny&#8217;s Recollections

It is not long after my visit to Gerry. After my coffee, they handcuffed my hands behind me and put me back in my cell.&nbsp; Now an escort comes.&nbsp; He links my wrist cuffs together and I am taken to a new room.

It smells antiseptic and very clean. The floor is covered in a smooth non-slip pale green vinyl which sparkles as I walk over it. There are white cupboards on the wall, an operating light on the ceiling and what looks like a dental chair in the centre. It&#8217;s upholstered in pale blue and has matching pale blue restraining straps, which look faintly ridiculous. It makes me want to giggle. Except I guess that won&#8217;t be appreciated.

Facing me is Celia, the girl I first met when she instructed me on personal hygiene on my first day. She is dressed in the same blue surgical scrubs and wears white surgical clogs on her feet. The same South African accent greets me. �Hi, Fifty,� she says. �Nice to see you again.&nbsp; I&#8217;d shake hands but..� She nods at my arms. �Turn around and I&#8217;ll release you. Hmmm, love that hair!� She looks at my bald head. 

�Yes,� I say casting my eyes down, still embarrassed by how it looks and by the fact that it is the result of my own failure to follow my instructions - again. �Well, I guess it will have grown back by the time I&#8217;m released after the course.�
 
�Err, actually Fifty, it won&#8217;t. According to your training plan,� she looks over towards an open laptop, �ah�&nbsp; your going to be shaven daily till release! You know we like to push your limits a bit. Besides, quite a lot of girls go shaven now and you look absolutely terrific just as you are.�

Her compliments are no consolation. I&#8217;m actually a bit shocked at this news and it must show in my face. Celia puts her arm round me and guides me to the couch. �Can I just check something? You gave permission for piercings subject to agreement at the time. Is that right?�

Suddenly I&#8217;m feeling a little uncomfortable. �Err, yes,� I say warily.

�So you&#8217;ll be all right with this?�

After my experience with Gerry I realise my past must be catching up with me. I had been told to get an extra ear piercing and I had tried to skip the challenge. Now it looks as if I am going to have it done to me afterall.

I look around; the place looks clean and clinical. Celia has the confident air of all medics. It&#8217;s reassuring and even though I know it&#8217;s stupid I think, why not? I hear myself saying, �Well, I suppose so.�
&nbsp; 
�Just lay down and we&#8217;ll get on.�

�Get on with what?�

She sighs. �You all start off with so many questions. Get on with what we are going to do. You will find out, so just accept it and don&#8217;t worry.� She&#8217;s busy with the straps of the chair, pulling one across my chest another around my waist, more around my ankles. As she fastens them, tightening them securely I feel both a sense of panic and a thrilling feeling. I flex a little against the straps. She pulls them tighter until I really cannot move. Once she sees I really am secured to the couch she speaks again. �Slaves need to learn respect, obedience and trust, Fifty. I think you know that you have fallen down a bit in your first exercise in the obedience department. Due to your failure, you&#8217;re bearing the consequences.� She looks up again at my bare scalp and runs a finger across it. �Still, I&#8217;m pleased with the consequences! OK, open your mouth.�

�Are you a dentist, then?� I&#8217;m becoming more worried now. 

�No. I&#8217;m a nurse, but my field is head and neck surgery, so I&#8217;m good with mouths and noses and things.�

�Just what are you going to do?�

�Ha! So curious, Fifty. Well that would be telling. All you need to know is that I am here and you are there and that you were going to open your mouth? And without talking.�

I suppose I can say stop right now. Perhaps I should, but I don&#8217;t. Celia&#8217;s professional manner, my own desire to experience as much of Inward Bound as I can and the way in which I have already become used to doing as I am asked overcomes my reticence. I open my mouth. She examines me with a dental mirror. She is very gentle as she pulls my mouth this way and that with latex covered fingers. It&#8217;s surprisingly reassuring.

�OK: no gingivitis, or calculus, but a bit of plaque on your terminal molars. I&#8217;ll give your teeth a polish and get rid of that for you. More attention to detail young lady! Also a good virtue in a slave, consensual or not.�

�Are there non-consensual slaves?� It&#8217;s an even more scary thought than being strapped to this couch.

�There are, and maybe I&#8217;ll turn you into one, if you don&#8217;t do as you are told!�

I feel a stab of panic and also, strangely, a stab of anticipation. She&#8217;s surely not being serious? 

�OK Fifty, I&#8217;m just going to protect your eyes from the light now.� She straps a blindfold on me. So, not exactly like the dentist. She travels slowly around my mouth with a dental hand piece polishing my teeth, which once again feels reassuring as well as tickly and all the more so as she has strapped me to the couch and I cannot get away. 

�Right Fifty, just swallow &#8211; it&#8217;s only a bit of toothpaste and saliva in your mouth.� I gulp it down, coughing as the pepperminty, gritty paste slips down. �And, now open up again, please.�
 
I open, but this time she slips an instrument between my teeth and before I can react, I hear the clicking of a ratchet and I can no longer close my mouth. I cry out in surprise making a curious squawking sound. I am further panicked by the feeling of a strap being pulled across my forehead locking it hard back against the couch and then there&#8217;s Celia&#8217;s fingers in my nose.&nbsp; 

�Easy girl, easy. You are going to be just fine. Here&#8217;s some cream to go inside your nose��

I try to say something, but of course I cannot say anything except to make a sort of gacking noise. But then there&#8217;s the feeling of Celia&#8217;s hand on my shoulder and slowly I calm down.

�OK Fifty. Here&#8217;s another test for you.&nbsp; Like the obedient slave girl you are �hmmm, well that&#8217;s a bit optimistic just now���.&nbsp; Lets say, will be �� I want you to stick your tongue out and incidentally, if you don&#8217;t, I&#8217;m going to grab it with a surgical clip.�

I don&#8217;t like the sound of the surgical clip and I do as I&#8217;m told.

�Good girl, for a change. OK, so now, I&#8217;m just going to catch your tongue and gently hold it with this,� There&#8217;s a click and a strange pressure on my tongue. �So, now you&#8217;re still OK, huh?
Let&#8217;s just have a look at your lingual veins.� I feel an instrument pressed onto the top of my tongue. �Congratulations- you have normal anatomy. That was just a light source to transilluminate you.�

I feel her lift up my tongue and pull it a fraction further forward. �And, a mark here and a mark under here.� In a flash, I realise that she must be going to pierce my tongue and I make another cry and hear her say. �OK Fifty, now just take a deep breath in � and out �. and in and out and just a sharp touch here.� I feel as if she has pressed on my tongue with a sharp pencil. There is a momentary tearing feeling, then nothing and I hear a clatter as something lands in a dish. ��..and there you are. All done! Now, just keep your tongue just there. Good. And this goes through there. And this slides back out. And this screws on here. And you&#8217;re done! You have just had a tongue piercing! You really should have had that extra piercing put in your ear. But, do you know what, I&#8217;m really glad you didn&#8217;t. Disobedience from you means fun for me!� 

I&#8217;m horrified that they&#8217;ve done this because of my disobedience. But, I&#8217;m relieved too and stunned that it was so easy. I would have never had the courage to do that in �civilian� life. I feel instantly high and I relax into the chair with relief that it&#8217;s all over.

�OK Fifty. That&#8217;s a 20 mm barbell. I&#8217;ve pierced your tongue about ten millimetres back from the tip, so everyone will get to admire your shiny stud when you speak. Plus there&#8217;s room for me to give you another further back later on if we decide to.�

I give a whimper at the prospect of more ironmongery in my mouth. From Celia&#8217;s tone I can imagine her grinning.

�Now, you will have a sore tongue for two or three days, so you will be on a soft diet.&nbsp; Careful oral hygiene please. . I&#8217;ll have some chlorhexidine mouthwash left in your cell, which I want you to use three times each day as well as brushing. In a week the swelling will subside and I&#8217;ll be able to insert a 15 mm rod for you and a couple of weeks after you&#8217;ll be down to a 12. How do you feel? Ah, you can&#8217;t say because of the Whitehead gag. It will be out in a second. Now, let&#8217;s look at your nose.� Nose? I can vaguely feel Celia in my nose again and the presence of her fingers means I have to breath through my mouth, but I have no idea what she is up to ����..and then I feel something cold on my skin ��..and then a dull crunching (but nothing sore) ���.and then whatever it was clatters down and Celia&#8217;s fingers are in my nose again with something else. I think I sense her squeezing hard ���..

�Right, Fifty: you are beginning to look like a real slave girl now! Earlier, I put some local anaesthetic gel on your septum and I have just taken a dermal punch to your septum and taken a 5mm core out so I could insert a titanium grommet. Titanium is very tissue friendly, which is just as well, because it&#8217;s in two parts and when I squeeze them home it&#8217;s a perfect friction fit and will just not come out. Ever. At all.�
 
I let out a gasp

�And I&#8217;m now inserting a nice chunky septum ring! Don&#8217;t worry too much. We do know slaves have to back to the real world! The grommet is made from anodised titanium and it&#8217;s a dark pink, so difficult to see normally &#8211; unless you know what to look for. As for the ring, this particular ring can be removed &#8211; but we have others which can&#8217;t. Now are you going to be lucky enough to get one of those????�

I whimper through the gag.

�I&#8217;m going to give you an intramuscular shot of penicillin in your thigh, just to avoid any risk of infection. Now you now know why we give you a detailed medical history form to complete?�

I&#8217;m sweating and starting to shiver, even though the room seems quite warm.

�Hey ho, hard day, huh?�&nbsp; Celia wraps me in a blanket, which is tucked firmly round me and I start to feel a bit better. She removes the blindfold and pushes the operating light out of the way. I blink against the bright lights of the medical room. She loosens off the gag and takes it from my mouth. Gradually, I seem to recover. I can feel the barbell in my tongue and the ring resting on my upper lip. For goodness sake, what have I let myself in for from these lunatics?

Celia raises the back of the couch and holds a mirror in front of my face. �I like to pierce the septum a little further back than some people. I think it looks far better if it&#8217;s not hanging down under your nose tip like a dew drop. What do you think?�

I open my mouth &#8211; but, once more, nothing comes out.

�Here,� Celia says, �drink this ���.�

She releases the strap across my forehead and puts a drinking straw to my lips. I gingerly, then gratefully, sip on down what seems to be a sports drink. Shortly after I really do begin to feel better &#8211; but look at the state of me!

�Well Fifty, we are done with the tough stuff for today. You coped pretty well. No screaming. That&#8217;s good. So now let&#8217;s do the admin.� Admin! Here I am with ironmongery in my mouth and nose and she&#8217;s worried about admin! �Now, your general knowledge should have told you that you address me as Mistress, not talk to me like I was a colleague in your university department.�

�Sorry &#8211; it&#8217;s just &#8211;it&#8217;s just��

�Sorry what?�

�I&#8217;m sorry, Mistress, but �. �

�Mistress who?�

�I&#8217;m sorry, Mistress Celia.� 

�Better! At last. Right, Slave Girl Fifty, I&#8217;m going to have to give you some demerits for your earlier mistakes, but you can redeem yourself tomorrow. I think you have had enough for now.�

�Thank you.�

�Thank you what?�

�Thank you, Mistress Celia�

�OK. Well that was another demerit! Let&#8217;s get you back to your cell before you trip yourself up again!� She laughs and pats me on the shoulder and then gives me a hug. I laugh along, although I can feel tears in my eyes. 

I&#8217;m unstrapped from the couch. Celia reconnects my wrist cuffs behind my back and an escort leads me away, still helpless, back to my cell. I lay there for a while, staring at the ceiling, wondering if Angela&#8217;s ideas on the research could possibly justify this; wondering if my own enthusiasm to experience this hasn&#8217;t pushed me into more than I can handle.

Chapter 11: Why Weight?

Course 8 / Day 3: Course Progress Meeting

Participant Notes: Fifty

Jo: She coped well with her initial work programme yesterday. No concerns so far, but of course little has been done to stretch her beyond her treatment on arrival and her shaving / piercing sessions, which she managed to get through without more than expected levels of distress. The exercise training regime continues today to increase her level of fitness.
 

Jenny's Recollections 

At the start of today, I&#8217;m feeling strange. I can hardly believe that I consented to them piercing my tongue and my septum but I can feel the stud in my mouth and the ring in my nose every time that I move my tongue or shake my head. The piercings feel a little sore. Not painful just &#8211; well &#8211; there. It&#8217;s more than that though; more than the physical discomfort. I&#8217;m left wondering what they are going to ask me to do and what I will consent to. 

Jo arrives with an electric razor. She has me kneel and then watches as I shave my head. She tells me that I will do this every day to keep my head smooth and hairless. It feels strange. It&#8217;s not like the hair has even started to grow back, or at least, so it seems. When I say this to Jo she simply tells me that it&#8217;s part of my routine. It doesn&#8217;t matter if there is hair or not, shaving is going to be done every morning first thing.

After that I&#8217;m brought to the gym to find myself confronted by George and my fellow slaves. We&#8217;re put into the same rubber G-strings and triathlon suits and lined up at one end of the gym with our hands on our heads.

George has in his hand the remote control that he can use to shock us. As if we needed reminding!&nbsp; 

While George is thumbing through some papers, I sneak a look around at the others. Carrie has also had her head shaved - it&#8217;s a relief to find I&#8217;m not the only one - but no-one else has a nose ring, at least so far �� Those who notice mine smile and I risk a quick smile back. 

�So, Fifty,� &#8211; it&#8217;s George speaking &#8211; �no real weight training experience?�

�No � Sir.� 

He smiles, but narrows one eye. The �Sir� was obviously expected a bit earlier in my reply.

�Why not?� 

�Er, well, err, Sir, I mean it&#8217;s not a thing girls do really, unless you are very sporty ��

�And do owners like flabby slaves?�

Owners. That word again. I get an odd stab of pleasure hearing it applied to me. 

�Well, no, I guess not. But doesn&#8217;t weight training make you all bulky and not very attractive?�

�Fifty: that&#8217;s just a myth. Yes, you can get overbuilt, but you have to work hard and very long to achieve that and it does not come by accident. On the other hand, what about her?�

He shows me a photograph of a gymnast. She is beautiful in her poise and her physique. No fat. Toned body. Defined muscle. Beautiful posture. Serious eye candy for sure. I mean, if you&#8217;re into women.

�Yes, Sir. She is very �. Beautiful.�

�I&#8217;m glad you agree, Fifty. I will have her picture put on your cell wall, to remind you where you are going� 

Cell wall? I get another adrenalin rush at George&#8217;s reminder. I know that is how I feel about it, but it&#8217;s a charge to hear it called that.

�So, this is the start of quite a long road for you. Weight training gives you everything she has and the inner strength of knowing you have worked hard to achieve it. Also, pleasure at knowing you delight the eyes of others. You OK with that?�

�Yes, Sir.�

�Good. So this is what you are going to do with us. We have eight weeks and you get two programmes. We&#8217;ll change things after about a month to give your body another challenge. Otherwise, you&#8217;d just stop improving. We have time to lay a foundation, which you will build on after you are discharged �.�

Once more, it seems as if Inward Bound is determined that we shouldn&#8217;t forget them after we leave.

�The first thing will be to teach you a repertoire of exercises and get your muscles and ligaments used to training. We will work your arms, shoulders, chest, back, abs, bum and legs and you get one day&#8217;s rest in between sessions. Come with me.�

So that&#8217;s aerobics every day and on alternate days we get weights as well. This is going to be tough. George then puts me to work learning the exercises for each area. I do one set of each &#8211; but fifteen repeats of each one. George is very picky about technique. It seems as if the appearance of my exercising is almost as important as the weight I lift and the pace of the work: count two lifting, count three lowering.&nbsp; He chooses weights that are heavy (for me), but not so heavy as to prevent my getting right to the end of the set. Even so, by the time I get to the twelfth repeat my muscles are starting to burn. 

He seems to know instinctively when I am about to flag, appearing at my side with an encouraging wave of his remote control and, sometimes, a word of encouragement. It&#8217;s enough to help me to keep going. Some of the others aren&#8217;t so lucky. Sue, for one, seems to earn a series of shocks from the remote.

After forty-five minutes, I can hardly lift my arms past horizontal, but my program is over and I join my colleagues in some post workout stretching.

Then, we get to strip off and have time in the pool. Here we are all naked. The water feels wonderful as it did before, flowing languidly across my bare shoulders, down my back and between my legs, small eddies teasing my labia. I&#8217;m surprised that I feel no embarrassment about being in the pool. Skinny dipping with four other girls I hardly know causes me no problems. Even being watched by the others, people who have de facto some serious authority over us, isn&#8217;t a difficulty.
 
I would never feel this way, if I were back at home, in my own environment with people I know well. I think about Joe and me. Where could we go to do this? How would he feel, if I were to suggest we �went naturist� when we go on holiday next time? Would I feel able to ask him? That&#8217;s the main question �..

As we are swimming I see that both Anna and Judy have impressive tattoos on their backs; elaborate dragon designs that are far more dramatic than anything I&#8217;ve seen before on a woman. I don&#8217;t get a chance to ask either Anna or Judy about them. I wonder if they got them on their first visit here and I remember the question on the application form asking if I&#8217;d consent to being marked. I&#8217;m worried that I said &#8216;yes, subject to approval at the time&#8217;. What will I do if they ask me to consent to something like that? I can always say &#8216;no&#8217; can&#8217;t I? But would I? I&#8217;m not sure. I didn&#8217;t say no when they asked about the piercings and look what happened to me then. 

All too soon &#8211; given that this is the closest I&#8217;ve had to any relaxation since I got here -&nbsp; it&#8217;s time to climb out and get dried, to be ready for work, but it&#8217;s been a good session.

�Fifty!�

�Yes, Sir?�

�There will also be this book in your cell. I expect you to read it. And, of course, you will be tested on knowledge and understanding.� George holds up a book on strength training and points at me with the remote control to emphasise his words. The message is absolutely clear!



Chapter 12: Ylena Zhukova

Course 8 / Day 4: Course Progress Meeting

Participant Notes: Fifty

Jo: Fifty expects corporal punishment to form part of her experience and Ylena has proposed an introductory session today. We will also let her have the first of her e-mail sessions.

Jenny's Recollections 

I am in my room. My cell. An escort comes for me. When I stand, she smiles and places a broad leather belt around my waist. My hands are cuffed to the belt behind my back and then I&#8217;m plunged into a sweet musky darkness as she drops a leather hood over my head. She must clip a lead to the belt; I feel a tug at my waist. �Come on, Fifty,� my escort says, �Just come with me.�

I feel panicky at first: walking blind with just the guidance of the lead and the voice of my escort to steer by.

The floor beneath my feet is non-slip vinyl near my room, then stone. We&#8217;re in a corridor now, I guess. The one that leads to the stairs.

�Fifty, pause.� I stop. �Good. You are at some stairs. Now step and step and step. That&#8217;s it, keep stepping.�&nbsp; I keep going up the stairs which wind to the left. Then, there&#8217;s polished wood under my feet as we reach the landing and finally, carpet as I am guided into somewhere new. 

We stop, I hear a door open and then we move again. She pulls the hood from my head and I see that I am in a room with a desk, computer and a stool. The stool is shaped like a saddle. �Sit,� says my escort. I lower my backside gingerly onto the chilly seat but thanks to the shape I have to spread my thighs and the front part tends to press on my clit. It feels like leather or vinyl against my naked bum.&nbsp;&nbsp; �You get to send e-mails from here and you&#8217;ll get to check this e-mail account once a week,� she says. She unclips my wrist cuffs. �You can e&#173;&#173;-mail your safe contact or anyone else but we&#8217;ll check what you&#8217;re sending before it goes. Mostly the slaves just like to send a �Hi, I&#8217;m having a good time� note to friends, but it&#8217;s up to you. You get fifteen minutes.� She stands back from the desk. I&#8217;m obviously not going to be left on my own &#8211; but the sensations from the saddle stool are a definite plus.

I think about it for a while. There&#8217;s nothing I want to say to Angela and I&#8217;m not sure what to say to Joe. But, in the end I tap out a short e-mail to him saying that I hope he&#8217;s fine and that I&#8217;ve managed to get access to e-mail occasionally if he wants to send me anything.

Soon enough my escort is telling me that my five minutes is up,&nbsp;&nbsp; She cuffs my hands back behind me. 

At the same time Judy arrives. The escort turns to her and says, �You&#8217;re to take Fifty up to room number 19�. Without waiting for a reply from Judy, the escort pulls the hood back on over my head. I&#8217;m not sure where I am going now, but I follow Judy, drawn along by the leash, being led along another corridor and through another door until we stop once again.

�We&#8217;re here,� Judy says to me quietly, as she stops. We&#8217;re both standing still. Suddenly, I feel Judy&#8217;s hands stroking and squeezing at my breasts. I can&#8217;t do anything about it with my hands cuffed behind me. In once instant, I'm shocked, surprised and aroused. It's the first instance of any overtly sexual behaviour since I came here. In an instant I remember that there is almost certainly more to being a slave than being kept naked and washing floors. But, she isn&#8217;t supposed to be doing that I&#8217;m sure.

I hear the sound of a door handle turning. Judy&#8217;s fondling stops. A voice says, �Ah, you are here. Bring her in. Take her hood off and leave us.�&nbsp;&nbsp; 

Judy removes my hood. I blink in the light looking at her. She grins at me as much as to say, �Enjoyed that didn&#8217;t you?�&nbsp; I&#8217;m not sure if I did, or not. Judy drops the leash, so it hangs from the middle of my belt down between my legs. She smiles at me again and leaves. 

Before me is another girl, this one about my own height, with blonde hair and a happy open face. I&#8217;m not sure if I should say anything about what Judy did, but I decide to leave it for now. She smiles perhaps a little diffidently and says, �Hello, Fifty. I am Ylena, but you should call me Gaspazha.�

Her English is very good, but accented. I guess from having met colleagues from Eastern Europe at the university that she is from Russia, or possibly somewhere on the Baltic. She has a slim athletic build and she is wearing a fitted leather top, which pushes her breasts upwards just enough to be provocative, a very smart leather skirt (not cheap I guess), black tights and black loafers.

�Now,� she continues, �you have come to me to continue your education, so today is training! Come with me.�&nbsp; She leans forward and grasps the lead, pulling gently, but insistently forward. We go to an adjoining room. The curtains are drawn giving the room a rather secret air. It is decorated in scarlet red wall paper and a pale blue carpet in the centre of the room is a wooden frame, its middle covered with padded leather. I have seen one before at a fetish show. It&#8217;s a spanking horse. I feel a knot as tight as any that have bound me grip my stomach.
 
�Kneel!� Gaspazha insists.

I obey.

�Good! So, you are learning some lessons at last.� She walks around me looking at me from each side.

�Excuse me,� I say.

�Yes?�

�Is Gaspazha your name?�

�Gaspazha is my title &#8211; in Russian. So you are going to learn some very useful Russian!�

My guess was correct

�Do you like CP, little Fifty?� I&#8217;m surprised by her use of the &#8216;little&#8217;, but I know better than to contest it. 

�In my fantasies, but I haven&#8217;t had much experience. Well none actually. My husband does not think it&#8217;s respectful. And before him� Well no.�

�Hmm,� she looks unconvinced. She walks around behind me and runs her hands across my back as though searching for some clue that I am lying. �Well, I&#8217;m pleased with your lack of experience really, because I like to work with novices. That way, I can mould you to my ways more easily. Easily for me, that is.� She smiles. I smile back, but I do feel very vulnerable. I didn&#8217;t think that she meant it would be easy for me. �Well, so much to do! Where shall I start? It&#8217;s like being an artist and you, moi slooga, are my blank canvas. When we have finished today, you will be beautifully decorated in reds, pinks and purples.� She can see I look confused. �Moi slooga &#8211; 'my slave'. You say 'vash slooga' - your slave. Say it!�

�Vassh slooga,� I try to copy her sound.

�Not quite: say vash-shlooga with emphasis on the ooo.�

I try again. She smiles tolerantly. �Oh well, never mind for now. But, I can be very encouraging to students. Now. Kiss.� 

She offers me the tab of her riding crop to kiss and immediately I am frightened that I am completely out of my depth. Gaspazha sees me tense. She reaches forward, stroking the back of my neck, a reassuring touch. The crop has a red star at its tip. There is a knot in my stomach and simultaneously a hot wetness in my loins. Fear and sexual anticipation. The combination of sensations that has always drawn me back to this.

�Bend forward and kiss my feet.�

I lean forward eagerly. She must know from my application that I have a strong foot fetish. Or maybe she doesn&#8217;t mind whether or not I like it.

�That&#8217;s right. Good across the shoe. Around my ankle, then my calf. Now the other one. Good. Now my toes.� She has slipped her foot out from her shoe and her foot smells sweet and leathery. �Now that tickles!�

�I&#8217;m sorry,� I say pulling back.�

�She says &#8216;I&#8217;m sorry&#8217;? Good moi slooga, you should be sorry. But, what you say is &#8216;izhveneetie&#8217; OK? Say it.�

I look at her. �Ishevenetia,� I say, haltingly.

�Izhveneetie; try again.�

�Izhveneetie.�

�Better!� She smiles again, obviously amused by my attempts at pronunciation. �Your nose ring. It tickles me.&nbsp; You were pierced earlier in the week I think, so if the ring can roll and swing like that, Cynthia must have put a little grommet in your septum, yes?�

�Yes.�
 
�Good. Is your ring permanent?�

�No.� At least, I think it isn&#8217;t.

�No what?� I can see she is becoming impatient.

�No Gaspazha�

�Better. And you are?�

�Sorry.�

�Izhvenetie! Say it again.�

�Izhvenetie.�

�Hmm.� She reaches down and plays for a moment with my nose ring. �Not permanent? Not permanent yet!�

I&#8217;m appalled by another flush of sexual excitement when she says yet!

�Good, but now we must move on. Get up there!� She picks up her crop and points to the spanking horse. Excitement is now replaced by plain anxiety. The horse supports my torso , knees and lower limbs. She straps me down: my arms, back and calves. My bum and most of my back are now completely at her mercy.

�We shall start with a little hand spanking.� SLAP! I gasp and buck forward and there is another SLAP on my other buttock. The pain is bright and sharp, but not bad enough for me to want her to stop. She carries on for �.for �..I have lost count of the slaps: perhaps twenty or so and then she stops and rubs me, stroking my buttocks.

�Good, well that&#8217;s very nice. Your nice little virgin bottom all red and hot. How do you feel?�

�Hot! Thank you Gaspazha! It was not as bad as I thought it would be.�

She laughs. �No? But that&#8217;s because we are just starting! I have to break you in slowly.� I am afraid again. �What is your job?�

�I work at a university: psychology.�

Psychology? Then you will know statistics?�

�Yes. Some�

�Good, I&#8217;m an accountant. I like numbers too,,,,,�

�Accountant???� It seems an incongruous occupation for a Russian disciplinarian.

�Da! Slooga.�
 
�So do you work here and do the accounts?�

�Ha! No: I am now a full time Domme. So many of my old colleagues I now meet as clients. I&#8217;m in private practice, but come here on certain sessions.�

�Private Practice??? I bite my lip to stop laughing &#8211; it just seems so bizarre.

�Here are two dice, Fifty. What is the probability of any number combination?�

�Well there are thirty-six possible outcomes. If they are fair, all combinations should have the same chance of turning up, but the probability of certain numbers in particular is different: a �two� is one chance in thirty-six, a seven is six chances in thirty-six because you can make a seven in more than one way.�

�Very good, Fifty. You are right! And some numbers might be quite dangerous for a slave strapped down and awaiting punishment�..� Gaspazha rolls the dice�. A six and a four. �Aha ten! So your bum can now taste ten different instruments! You see, we have such a choice.� She opens a cupboard in the wall of the room revealing a range of punishment implements. �Let&#8217;s see, now. A small paddle; a large paddle; a strap; a tawse; a wooden spoon;&nbsp; a horse hair flogger; a cow hide flogger; a crop; a paddle with holes in it and ��. Another tawse! I am going to enjoy this and your poor bottom just cannot get away can it?� I think this is a rhetorical question, but Gaspazha insists. �Can it?�
&nbsp; 
�No, Gaspazha,�


�And, how many of each should you get? Just look at these very special dice.� Gaspazha comes close to me and I can see she has a handful of dice but there are numbers on each face, not spots and the numbers are in the twenties and thirties! �Hmm, perhaps these.� More dice, but this time lower numbers. I sigh with relief. 

�You have a safe word, don&#8217;t you?�

�Yes, it is �.�

And, as I am about to tell her she slips what I later learned was a pony bit gag into my mouth, fastening it firmly behind my head.

�Not anymore! No interference from safe words! Not for a beginner. Not needed so soon. You only may need it when things get difficult. So we begin ��..�

Gaspazha then begins to beat me with slow deliberate strokes, counting each stroke in Russian (at least I think that&#8217;s what she is doing) and I follow in my head in English. I am getting fifteen strokes from each instrument &#8211; that&#8217;s ten times fifteen &#8211; that&#8217;s 150 in all.
 
She shows me each implement before she starts. Each implement has a different feel: the horse hair whip is scratchy and tickly both at the same time. The floggers are bright and �peppery�, whilst the paddles and tawses are thuddy and stingy, depending on which one in particular.

Gaspazha is clearly a craftswoman when it comes to this: she alters her force and rhythm and timing and I manage gradually to scale the heights of 150 strokes. 

An accountant by day and a Domme by night, Dr. Jekyll and Mr. (Ms. in this case) Hyde. I drift off, seduced by the rhythm of the strokes. SLAP! Ouch! That was different. That hurt more.

�Aha: I&#8217;m not satisfied with that one. My technique was bad. Here it is again.� SLAP! And, it is sore and it does hurt second time round but better. So even in spanking, there is evidently correct technique to be mastered.

Eventually we are done &#8211; and my bum is throbbing and on fire, but a nice fire.

�There Fifty: you took that well: no screaming and no safe word used!� I grunt into my gag to indicate that I couldn&#8217;t but actually I didn&#8217;t ever want to. �Well done. What do say to your Gaspazha? Ha! But, let me help you.�

She unfastens the pony bit gag. I sigh a long sigh: I am covered with perspiration &#8211; and Gaspazha then picks up a long whippy cane and swishes it through the air. I thought we had finished!!?? ����

�Have you ever had the cane, Fifty? Hmm, probably not, I think.&nbsp; Actually, I like caning people, as you will find out. But, not for you today.�

Oh! Relief!

�Come.� She unstraps me from the horse. I stand unsteadily. �Here.� She hands me a fresh orange juice. It has never tasted so good. �Another?�

�Thank you, Gaspazha.� I nod.

�Spaseeba, Gaspazha. You should say &#8216;spaseeba&#8217;.&nbsp; I think you have earned a demerit for that last mistake and I will enjoy helping you to pay for it.�

�But I didn&#8217;t know the Russian for thank you. How could I?�

�No, I know you didn&#8217;t, but Fifty life is not always fair! Now: you have managed to earn er,� She turns to consult another laptop &#8211; every one here seems to have one. �Da! Yes, 100 demerits.�

�100???�

�Da, Da, Da! 100. And today you managed to pay back forty by managing your training well, so that&#8217;s sixty still to pay. Our interest rate on unpaid accounts is 10% per day, or ten strokes, whichever is greater.&nbsp; So assuming no more demerits, when I see you next week, you will have a debt of sixty plus seventy or 130 to clear!�
 
She sees that I am becoming distressed. �Now,� Gaspazha becomes reassuring, putting her arm around me, �the cane is worth more that paddles and straps, so I expect you will be anxious for me to give you a good caning next time?�

�Da Gaspazha &#8211; I think.�

�Good! That&#8217;s excellent! I shall look forward to seeing you again! And, just look at your bottom. That&#8217;s wonderful. Let me photograph you for your record. I like to keep a picture of my art.



Chapter 13: Is There Life After Housework?

Course 8 / Day 5: Course Progress Meeting

Participant Notes: Fifty

Jo: Fifty is showing reasonable progress with her work and slave training sessions and seems to be reconciled to being naked, pierced and shaved. Gerry, Ylena and Celia all report her responses are satisfactory and she seems to have settled into accommodation without difficulty. Introductory sessions have established her discipline programme, so we intend to continue with planned training / experience regime. 

Jenny's Recollections

I awake to find daylight seeping in through my room &#8211; no, let&#8217;s be frank - my cell window. There is no clock and so I don't know the exact time. I guess it&#8217;s maybe half past six in the morning.

I feel quite good considering what I went through yesterday. 

There's no mirror, either. I run my hand through my hair, only there is no hair, of course, just my bare scalp. My arm brushes my nose ring and when I swallow, my tongue feels swollen and tender. My buttocks are still sore from the attentions of Ylena, my Gaspazha.

The feeling that I had on waking of being rested is replaced by anxiety about the coming day; about what other challenges are in wait for me. � 

There is nothing to read, nothing at all in my cell except for the blanket that covered me for the night, a small towel, soap, toothbrush and toothpaste. There&#8217;s a razor and shaving cream too, which I had thought was just for my pussy, and an electric razor to use on my head.&nbsp; I lay in bed for a while thinking. Thinking about how natural this all seems to me now, how easily I seem to have fallen in to the routine here, how easy it's been to submerge myself in the rules and the rituals. Why couldn't Joe and I do any of this? Why couldn't we even talk about this? He always seemed kind, maybe just a bit preoccupied with work, but somehow whenever I tried to bring up the subject he'd fend it away. Even in bed, if I tried to get him to take a more dominant role, he seemed to shy away from it. It wasn't ever that he said he disapproved, more that he couldn't see how it related to him and me. Was it his fault? Was it mine? I don't know and I don't feel I'm getting any closer to that here.&nbsp; 

I get up and go to the toilet.&nbsp; At least, with the shutters down, no one can see me squatting or cleaning myself inside. I still cringe about having to do that, but at least I&#8217;m alone.

I have a shower: standing on the toilet foot pads, turning on the water and letting it cascade off my naked body and down the toilet.

I shave my pussy again, as they&#8217;ve told me. I shave my scalp, too.

I get dry. With no hair this doesn't take long and the towel is only just damp at the end of it. It's quite warm in my cell. The water was hot too., I'd half expected it to be cold; my gaolers obviously aren't being as unreasonable today as they could be.

I clean my teeth carefully&#8211; carefully because of my new tongue piercing.&nbsp;&nbsp; It's awkward trying to move the brush around my mouth without knocking the stud and besides my tongue feels swollen and bruised. Celia gave me some chlorhexidine mouth wash to help with the healing.

It's all I can think of to do. The light through my cell window is getting brighter. I guess it could be seven o'clock now but I don't have any way of knowing for sure. I sit on the edge of the bed.

There's a mechanical click and the shutter on the outside of the cell bars begins to rise. Josephine is standing there, smiling. I get to my feet. It seems appropriate.

�Good morning, Fifty!� Her tone is cheery. �Good to see you are up. Ready for the new day?�&nbsp;&nbsp; I nod. �Turn round.� I do as she asks. �Hmmm, nice red bum! I heard your meeting with Ylena went well. Now, turn back to face me. Good. Just look at you! A ringed, collared, and shaven slave. Very tasty! Suits you!�

I find myself smiling gratefully and feeling definitely aroused at the combination of standing naked for her appraisal and the backhanded compliments. 

�Well, Fifty, the first thing today is to take you for your gym session. You&#8217;ve been missing out.� Jo unfastens the cell door and slides the bars back. �Come!�

Jo leads me back down to the gym. It&#8217;s a weights session today. The others have got a head start on me. I&#8217;m finding it harder work than they are by the looks of it. I get quite a few shocks in my pussy when George &#8211; it&#8217;s him that&#8217;s supervising our exercise today &#8211; thinks I&#8217;m not working hard enough. He looks like he&#8217;s getting as much fun from handing out punishment shocks as Jo did. At the end of it I&#8217;ve lifted more than I would have thought I could and worked harder and longer than I thought was possible.

For breakfast we&#8217;re in the same room where we all last sat together on the first night

I look across the room at them sitting with their bowls in front of them.&nbsp; Sue is naked just like me. The others wear grey sweat tee-shirts and short skirts and Carrie's head has been shaved like mine. I guess that Sue, Carrie and I are supposed to be a dire warning to the others, or a promise of what's to come for them?

Anyway &#8211; I&#8217;m pleased to see that I'm not the only one in the wars, so to speak.

Breakfast follows the general pattern of the other meals I have had: aggressively wholesome! This time, though, they seem to have given me some consideration. In respect of my pierced tongue (maybe), we have been given porridge (with milk, so things are definitely looking up) yoghurt (low fat variety) and soft rolls. It still takes me ages to eat it. I apologise to the others. I explain why and they all want to see my tongue. I'm embarrassed and proud at the same time.

After we have finished breakfast, Jo appears again and takes us up to the main hall. She has us stand in a semicircle at one end of the room.

�Now, girls,� she says with the hearty tone of a school mistress welcoming a new batch of pupils, �you've had a quiet few days to settle in. Now, your programme really starts.� I'm thinking that the last few days have been anything but quiet for me. Imprisoned, kept without clothes, the hair from my scalp removed and with all this ironmongery put into my body; how is that quiet? �The purpose of a slave is to be useful. In order to be useful, you need to learn obedience, humility and discipline of course, but you need to learn to work, too. Today you will start to learn to be useful here.� 

I suppose when I'd thought about this, I expected the discipline and the obedience. I wasn't sure what she might mean by humility and I hadn't really expected that they would make us work. Mind you, I don't know what I had expected. A continuous round of sensual domination?

Jo went on with her briefing, �When the Centre here is not being used to training slaves, like yourselves, you might wonder what we do with the premises. Well, the estate is used for Corporate Management Training. That means that the place has to be made ship shape for the next course. Your job over the next couple of months is going to be to get it ready for use. Cleaned, polished, tidied. All useful domestic skills for any slave. After all, a slave isn't just for the bedroom, she's for life.� Jo smiles. The rest of us look less comfortable, I suspect as a result of the reminder that there will probably be some sexual aspect to our slavery. �Every day you will all have some 'Useful Time', time spent working on tasks that you have been assigned in addition to any training or correction. Today, most of you will be on cleaning duties.� 

Ingenious, I think to myself. We are paying to have a slave experience and Inward Bound get to simultaneously reduce the operating overheads for this other legitimate, vanilla, business!

�But, before we go on,� Jo hasn't finished with us yet. �Just a few words about your progress.
On your joining instructions, we said that an important part of your experience would be to learn to receive and carry out instructions? You all remember that?� We all nod. �Well, Carrie did not manage to get her hair cut as instructed, so we have helped her there and a little bit more. Sue did not manage to get her dress code quite right, as you may have guessed.� Sue blushed, pink spreading down from her face and across her naked chest. �And Jenny, poor Jenny, is clearly very new to the game, as you can see. She's naked because she didn't think we meant what we said about the dress code. She failed to follow instructions at the hairdressers, so she has this wonderful shaven head. And, she missed out on her extra ear piercing so - push your tongue out Jenny,� I do as she asks. �And,� Jo reaches up and grips my nose ring to pull me gently forward out of line with the others, �she has this delightful nose ring too. Doesn&#8217;t she look terrific?�

The others stay quiet. Maybe they don't agree, or maybe they are just waking up to what might happen to them.

�Well girls, should we sell our collared slave girl, or keep her as a reminder to you all?�
&nbsp; 
We all laugh and the tension is broken until Anna decides to add, �I think you should sell her!�

Once more, I feel an astonishing sexual thrill at the idea mixed with horror at the very idea itself and anger at being �betrayed� by a fellow slave.

Fortunately, Jo laughed, saying �No Anna. She has not been trained to a high enough standard &#8211; not yet anyway - but what about you? I&#8216;m sure your master could be persuaded to put you up for auction at the end of your course? I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;d fetch a good price.�

I don&#8217;t know what to think about this exchange. Part of me feels very sexually excited. Part of me feels shocked. Part of me feels Anna deserves it! I think the others are uncomfortable, too. There&#8217;s a nervous laugh from all of them.
 
Jo continues, �Anna and Judy have been before. This is their second training course. We&#8217;ll expect a higher standard from them, of course. Turn round you two and drop your pants,� she orders. �Show your bums to the others.�

The two girls turn around, lift their short skirts and wriggle their panties down over their hips in a flirtatious way that brings a sigh of exasperation from Jo. Both girls are beautifully, if that&#8217;s the word, marked with parallel cane marks across their buttocks &#8211; I count quickly and decide there must be twelve or fifteen tram lines. The wheals are deeper than anything that Ylena had inflicted on me.

�All right you two tarts, that&#8217;s enough. Now to work! Anna, Judy &#8211; you&#8217;ll clean up in the kitchens. Carrie, start in the study rooms at the end there. Jenny, Sue, this hall floor needs to be washed; you can deal with this. Stand over in that corner you two, face the wall and wait for me to return. Anna, Judy, Carrie can come with me.�
 
Presently, Jo returns.

�Now, you two,� she begins. �Two things. When I am training you, we will use your numbers, Fifty-three isn&#8217;t it?� Sue nodded. �And Fifty.&nbsp; You will call me Mistress.� She looked at us with a fixed stare. �Who am I?�

�Mistress Josephine,� Sue and I chorus together.

�Well done.� Jo gestures to the floor, Victorian mosaic tiles in beige and blue. �You will wash this floor. You will use a two bucket technique. One bucket has soapy water. One has fresh water. You wash with the soapy water and rinse with the clean water. This way, the soapy water always stays clean and the fresh water gets dirty and you change it as soon as needs be. You will find buckets, soap and squeegee mops in the domestic room downstairs. Now get to it. You have one hour to get the floor spotless. I will start you with fifty demerits each and let&#8217;s see how many you get to keep!�

Demerits mean more cane strokes and I have an overdraft already, so Sue and I set to with a will. It feels strange, the two of us, naked, mopping and cleaning, but by the end of an hour the floor is looking much better than before and I&#8217;m feeling pleased with what we&#8217;ve done.

Jo, needless to say, is not so easily satisfied. She kicks her shoes off as she comes into the hall and walks across to us barefoot. Just a glance at the soles of her feet shows that there is still dirt there. �Right. Fifty-three and Fifty. Possible demerits fifty. For this effort I will reduce that by ten each. That leaves you with forty each. Now, you have another chance to get this floor clean and if it&#8217;s not perfect I will be pleased to award to sixty demerits each.�

I&#8217;m getting better at mental arithmetic all the time. I have a debt of sixty and could be awarded sixty more if Jo is not satisfied with our efforts. That&#8217;s one hundred and twenty and with interest at 10% a day is going to add up to a very sore backside! 

Needless to say, we set to again with desperation at our elbows. When Jo comes back, she rewards us by accepting our efforts and confirming our score of only forty demerits for our morning&#8217;s work. Then, she adds on ten each for our initial failures!

�You see Fifty and Fifty-three, achieving high standards can be a painful process!� 


Chapter 14: How To Be A Gardener


Course 8 / Day 6: Course Progress Meeting

Participant Notes: Fifty

Jo: Time for Fifty to start getting involved in some outdoor activities and help with preparations for the garden party.


Jenny&#8217;s Recollections

I am waking up early and feeling refreshed these days.

I guess the (very) regular hours with nothing in the way of normal household or occupational responsibilities must be good for me, and but today it's rather before the usual time (as far as I can tell) when the shutter goes up and Jo is outside my cell. She opens the bars and comes in.
 
�O.K, Fifty; just get yourself ready and you can go to breakfast.�

�Er, Mistress, you have caught me before I have &#8211; you know &#8211; been to the loo. Could you, err, give me a moment?�

�Of course, off you go.� She goes on standing there with her arms folded.

�But, erm, I&#8217;d rather be alone ���.� I still haven't got used to the complete lack of privacy that the slaves are expected to endure.

�Mmmm, you probably would,� Jo is sympathetic but firm, �but life is different for you now. Off you go and squat.�

Her use of the word �squat� seems to carry a very odd sexual charge. I find it odd how some words have the way of turning a switch in my brain. For a second, I&#8217;m pulled between the sexiness of what she is telling me to do and the embarrassment of actually going whilst another adult watches.
 
�Er, do you have to? I mean, I don&#8217;t even go in front of Joe at home. I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m really at my best.�

�Fifty, slaves get to do as they are told and they also have to learn to think rather less about themselves. It seems to me that&#8217;s a lesson you need to take on board. If it makes you feel any better, look up there.� Jo points to the ceiling at the inconspicuous black ball and its little red light. �When you are in your cell, we need to watch over you. That&#8217;s a security camera; we have watched you 'go' ever since you have been here.� I know she's right of course, I'd suspected that it was something of the kind. �Now, I haven&#8217;t all day. Use the toilet and let's get on.�

For some reason, using the toilet when there is someone else actually there is still very awkward. I&#8217;ve got used to the likelihood of having a monitored camera in my cell and I don&#8217;t think about it anymore, but this is different. With a sigh I do as I am told and the only saving grace is that the squatting toilet makes the mechanics of everything somehow more effective. I can't look anywhere, but straight ahead at the floor while I'm doing it, but I'm sure that Jo is studying my every move closely. There is no toilet paper in my cell and I have to wash my bum with water from a hose placed just by the toilet pan (or should it be �dish�?) - all watched by Jo.

The hose tap is elbow operated and the water comes out at a pre-set temperature.&nbsp; It&#8217;s on the cool side of warm and there is no adjustment for it. To the side is a bottle of liquid soap with a pump-top which, once again, can be elbow operated. This has occurred to me before, but the whole arrangement in my cell has a sort of �animal husbandry� feel to it, even to the way my mattress has a wipe-clean surface and the floor of the cell slopes ever so gently towards the toilet dish, so that everything can be hosed down. &#8211; That last, being one of the personal house keeping duties I have to do every day. When I try to stand back and think psychologically, all these small things (plus the metal bowls we eat from) add up to deliver a powerful, unmistakable message; �You are not like us, you are less. You are animal. You are a utility.�


�At last, Fifty! Now shave your crotch and scalp and clean your teeth and face, please.� I do as she says, but she hasn't forgotten my earlier lack of enthusiasm for following orders. �Right, to help you be rather more obedient, you can have 10 demerits! We will obviously have to do this again regularly until you lose some of your inhibitions.�

�Thank you, Mistress,� seems the safest reply, although I'm not looking forward to that.

�You&#8217;re welcome, Fifty!� Jo responds, cheerily, ignoring my reticence.

After breakfast, the girls and I are taken out to the garden. One of the support staff &#8211; &#8216;the Keepers&#8217;, as I call them &#8211; tells us that it&#8217;s time we helped with the gardening. So, we are given hoes and all troop off to work on the flower beds, of which there are several very large ones.

It's my first really good look at the Inward Bound �Spa� from the outside in daylight.

The building is quite large, but extends much further back than the frontage suggests.
The garden looks rather �municipal�: all flower beds and banks of small conifers and rhododendrons. The main drive winds away and is very soon lost behind the trees. I glance round, but there are no other buildings in sight. Because of the shrubbery there's no view of any nearby houses, or come to that hills or even a boundary wall. It's just as well, as both Sue and I are completely in the nip! Fortunately, it&#8217;s a warm rather humid day and as my colleagues start to sweat, I&#8217;m left feeling really OK.

I wonder about the house and what it might have been. It's obviously an old house, perhaps from the turn of the last century, so it must have been bought or rented by Inward Bound. Our own accommodation isn&#8217;t something many landlords would want done to their property by a tenant, so I'm guessing that tends to rule out a rented or leased property. Buying a place like this in good condition in south east England would need serious money. and I get the impression that Inward Bound is a relatively young organisation, so I imagine that they bought it in a fairly run down state and have been busy upgrading ever since.

So, an old house? Hmmm, the kitchen area is a bit industrial for that. School?&nbsp; Not enough �class rooms� from what I have seen. A convalescent home or sanatorium or perhaps an asylum? A hospital would explain the large kitchens and the large gardens. Shielding the house from the surroundings would be appropriate for an asylum or sanatorium. I know a lot of sanatoria closed in when antibiotics became effective against TB in the 1950&#8217;s, but that&#8217;s too long ago for the way the place is fitted out, unless Inward Bound have done a lot of work. On the other hand, mental&nbsp; health reforms in recent years led to smaller inpatient asylums being sold off, and that would fit. So that&#8217;s it. I bet this was an old asylum. Ironic. It&#8217;s a sort of asylum again � That would be rich! You don't have to be mad to apply to come here, but it helps!

My suppositions are cut short by the arrival of lunch. It's a more lavish affair than usual for us slaves; sports energy drinks, sandwiches and fruit.&nbsp; Well, we are doing a pretty physical session today.

Towards the end of the afternoon, the Keeper in charge of us calls us together for a short break. Sue is sent in to deal with some domestic tasks, but then he tells the rest of us that the last job for the day is to mow the lawn... 

One of his colleagues appears with a large collection of straps which he passes out to us. We all don what looks like a climber&#8217;s body harness &#8211; it&#8217;s one of the few things that I have worn since I have been here! Once we have them on, the Keeper comes around and checks the straps, tightening those that seem loose. Then, he and his colleague fasten our wrists to the harness behind out backs and fits each of us with a rubber bit gag.

We are formed into a team of four, two by two, Carrie and Anna, Judy and me. We're led off to be harnessed to a mower. �OK girls,� the Keeper says, �you're going to pull this. Lets say it's your contribution to reducing carbon emissions. You can help to save the planet!� 

The mower has a small seat on top and the keeper climbs up onto it. 

I've fantasised about pony play sometimes, but it was always with the idea of me being some fine animal being paraded with a feather head dress. This isn't anything like glamorous and if you're looking for pony play, this is hardly what you would call �play�. The Keeper has a small flogger and the two girls closest to the mower are dangerously in range. 

�OK girls, here is how this goes,� the Keeper begins. �I will shout, 'Pull', 'Stop', 'Left',
'Right' or 'Straight On', and that's JUST what you will ALL do TOGETHER. You will pull as a team and watch out for each other. Anyone who doesn&#8217;t pull their weight gets whipped. Anyone who wrong foots their neighbour gets whipped. Any questions? No? Good. Then PULL!�

Questions are difficult to express when you are gagged, but the ground rules seem pretty straight forward and off we go.

Actually, the grass is reasonably short anyway and the mower glides quite easily over the lawn &#8211; but there is a lot of lawn and, inevitably, our legs start to tire. The Keeper&nbsp; threatens a severe whipping for the first one to slow down. The encouraging flicks of his whip are coming more frequently.

Then, the rain starts. At first one large heavy drop splats onto the drive just to our side as we hall the mower past, then another and another. The rainfall builds up in intensity astonishingly quickly. In hardly a couple of minutes the rain is pounding down on us. I glance up. The Keeper is drenched. The other girls are soaked; their grey sweat skirts and tops clinging to their bodies and hair laying lank and saturated across brows and shoulders and it's all horribly unpleasant &#8211; except for Sue and me! I am naked and shaven and the rain just cascades off me, like water off a duck&#8217;s back. As I look round I start to chuckle (as far as you can when you are bit-gagged) and as my colleagues look round to see what I am about, I begin to laugh and laugh and laugh.

Above the noise of the rain, the keeper aims a sharp glance at me, and flicks the tail of his whip across my naked, dripping buttocks.

�Just what is the matter with you, Fifty?�

He dismounts and squelches round to where I am hitched up in the team and removes my bit. �Well?�

I'm giggling hopelessly. I can barely get my words out. �It's -&nbsp; hurhh &#8211; It's just that &#8211; mmm - if you're naked, there is absolutely no problem with the rain! This is the first time I have been really glad about getting my Joining Instructions wrong! You should try it!�

He looks at he through eyes narrowed against the downpour and I&#8217;m wondering whether my frankness was really wise. He turns back to the rest of the girls. �All right, Team, rain stops play. Back to the garage.�

We all pull the mover off the lawn, onto the drive and round the back of the house to the forecourt of the garage -&nbsp; which in times past, has been thoughtfully roofed over with glass.&nbsp; We are all unhitched and unharnessed, except that I am taken right back outside into the rain by the Keeper. 

I'm attached by a chain run from my wrists to a metal ring in the wall about a couple of feet above my head. �Well, Fifty,� the Keeper says, �if you like the rain so much, I shall let you enjoy some more of it!�

So, there he leaves me, while he takes the others inside. I stand for what must be an hour, until the rain stops. I am cold and shivering when he returns.

�So, was it worth it, Fifty?�

�Pardon, Sir?�

�Laughter comes at a price!�

�I'm sorry, Sir,� I apologise but, inside, I think it's probably the only time I will have the upper hand the whole time I&#8217;m here! 

In the evening, I am taken to see Celia again. At first, I assume she is going to check my piercings are healing properly, as the first thing she tells me is to lay down on her medical couch. But then, I realise that there must be something else, because my bum is hardly on the couch before I am being strapped down and blindfolded....

Even in the present circumstances, her lilting South African accent has a reassuring calmness about it.

�OK Fifty, let me see how you are doing?� I feel her fingering the ring through my septum. �Hmm, healing well and that&#8217;s encouraging. Just open your mouth a shade more�. Oral hygiene up to speed�..good �..just a moment.�

I give an involuntary �gunghh!� as a hard, rubbery tasting bar is pressed across my mouth. Celia is putting a pony bit gag (as I remember from this afternoons exertions) in place and straps me down just a little bit firmer. As the straps grip tighter, my anxiety rises in step.

�Right, Fifty you are going to get two or three more tokens of slavery, lucky girl!�

I try to respond, but the gag very effectively prevents any coherent comments.

Celia chuckled, �Yes, I just knew you would be pleased!�

Was I going to say I was pleased??

Then, I feel her playing with my nipples. First right, then left. Then a pause. Then, the crackling of a sterile wrapper being opened. 

I feel a cold metallic touch as she grasps my nipple with some sort of clamp. There's a sharp crushing pain and I cry out - but that does not prevent the same thing happening to my other nipple.

Celia has pierced my nipples! Two tokens of slave hood. Am I surprised? No. In fact, it&#8217;s almost expected and I am pleased in a sort of deep-down, visceral, way.

She is back manipulating the right one: it stings a little and feels bruised, but actually not too bad and the procedure is again repeated on the left side.

�There! As always, you look wonderful! I just know you will agree.� There's a slight pause. I can hear her moving about.� Now, this next job will take just a little longer.�

Someone else comes into the room. The two of them start to do something to my right forearm. The first thing I feel is a stinging prick , like an injection.

�OK Fifty. I am just going to make your skin nice and numb.� Another pause. �You might feel a little pushing and tugging � there� nod if you are OK?�

I nod &#8211; hesitantly and anxiously.

�A little pushing now �. And, some pressing now �And, this is to stop a tiny little bit of bleeding.�

Bleeding? Is Celia taking my blood and if so, what on earth for?&nbsp; Now, I am getting frightened. I have rapidly stopped enjoying the session, but it is anxiety rather than discomfort that is driving my feelings. I start to cry, sobbing at my inability to stop what was happening.

�Now, now, Fifty,� Celia is trying to calm me. �Just be the good slave that you are and trust your betters. I&#8217;m putting a dressing on your arm now and you are done.�

Celia wipes my face with a warm damp cloth and I begin to feel better. She takes the gag off and blindfold too. I lift my head as far as the straps will allow and look down at my chest to see both nipples ringed. On my arm I can see a white surgical dressing covered by some sort of plasticky&nbsp; (presumably waterproof) bandage.

�Well, Fifty, what do you think?�

Celia is obviously very pleased with her efforts.&nbsp; The first thing I say, for reasons I don't understand at all, is, �But Celia, if I have babies, how will I be able to feed them?�

For a moment, Celia looks as though she is lost for words, then bursts out laughing as I start crying.

�Now, Fifty,� she chides, �for starters, we both know that if you got pregnant right now, you wouldn&#8217;t need to breast feed for nine months, by which time you will be well healed. Girls with pierced nipples can breastfeed just fine. You can always swap your rings for rods which baby will easily manage.�

I&#8217;m still sobbing. �What have you done to my arm?�

�I&#8217;ve given you an RFID.� She sees my blank look. �Radio Frequency Identification.� I look none the wiser. �You have been chipped. Supermarkets use these to keep track of their stock. Now, we're using them to keep track of ours! With this we will always know where you are and you can interact with the house security systems. It's really quite small and has been snuggled under your skin. I closed the wound over with skin adhesive, so there will be almost no scar and the best thing is after healing, they are very hard to remove. The chip will let you into places we want you to go, keep you out of places we don&#8217;t want you in and keep you in places where we would like you to be. It also it carries your Inward Bound slave number and your number on the International Register of Slaves and Submissives. Anyone with an RFID reader can tell who you are and what you are.� 

�But, nobody asked my permission! No one asked if I wanted to be 'chipped'! No one said anything about a register.� I'm angry, but at the same time aroused. How strange is that? To be walking around with this thing in your arm that would let someone point a device at you and have it tell them everything about you? It feels very unsettling.

Celia dismisses my annoyance. �Of course not, Fifty! Why should they? You are a slave. Of course slaves don&#8217;t get asked.�

"But, I'm only on a course! This is only for a couple of months!"

�Mmmmm, so you are. But, we all get changed by life's experiences. Short or long. One way or another. That's why you're here, isn't it?" 

Celia&#8217;s blunt exposition of the facts of life leaves me feeling aroused and angry at myself for being aroused by what's been done to me &#8211; not so much my nipples, as the RFID. I&#8217;m also left feeling very tired and a bit sick.,&nbsp; So, Celia and her colleague, a Chinese looking guy called Jonathan, look after me until I feel able to go back to my cell for the night. 

When I get there, I lay in bed missing Joe for the first time: feeling that maybe this is all too much, that maybe I can't take this, maybe I shouldn't take this, wishing for his more gentle touch. It's while I'm thinking about Joe that I fall asleep.

Chapter 15: The Garden Party

Course 8 / Day 6: Course Progress Meeting

Participant Notes: Fifty

Jo: No reason why Fifty should not be involved in today's �open day�. Her basic skills are sufficient for any of the service tasks envisaged for supporting the day, rather than any of the tasks for which we will use the more experienced, second-course trainees. Everyone is set up to let the people from Clegg Enterprises to see what we&#8217;re doing with their investment.


Jenny's Recollections 


Actually, now that I come to think about it, there seems to be something going on: I'm even more sure about my feelings later, when the shutter to my cell goes up and there is no communal breakfast, either. 

Anna comes with a tray that she leaves outside the bars of my cell. I have to kneel down and reach through the bars to get at the food; some fruit, a bread roll and a glass of orange juice. By the time Anna walks by with the next tray for the cell beside mine I've already finished eating. She smiles and picks up the empty tray without saying anything. And, I notice that Anna&#8217;s nipples are also pierced &#8211; though her rings have obviously been there a while, perhaps since her first visit here - but her arm is dressed like mine.

I wash and shave, It&#8217;s become a morning ritual. Nothing happens for quite a while. That's unusual. Usually we are out of our cells and working by now.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

Then, things get very busy indeed. Carrie, Sue and I are collected by Jo. There is no time for niceties. 

We&#8217;re taken out of our cells. As I go through the door of mine, I hear a short beep and I realise that there is a sensor on the door frame registering the RFID chip in my arm. I can&#8217;t get used to the fact that somewhere a computer can record each time I go from one room to another, noting down every time the chip in my arm passes one of their sensors.

�Right, you three,� she says when we arrive in the main hall. �We want twenty chairs put out in rows over there. Then we need five tables each with six chairs, laid up for lunch and another row of tables to hold a buffet out on the terrace. When you've done that Fifty-two and Fifty will be waiting at table for lunch. You, Fifty-three, are to report to Ylena.� I'm confused by what's going on and jealous that Sue has been chosen for Ylena, for whatever it is. Jo must know that Ylena is my Gaspazha. 

Jo can see I am hesitating. �What is it Fifty? Was I not clear? Or do you want some demerits?�

�Yes, Mistress, I mean, no Mistress,� I babble and scuttle off with Carrie and Sue to find the things that are needed. With the three of us working, it doesn't take us too long. By the time Jo returns, the room is laid out as she has ordered and we've laid up the tables on the terrace. As she comes into the room, the three of us stand waiting, our hands behind our backs. Ylena is with her. Jo makes a swift inspection of the room and declares herself satisfied.

�Well done, slaves,� she says. �Sorry, Ylena they've earned no more demerits this time.� 

Ylena smiles. �Never mind,� she says. �It's Fifty-three that's coming with me isn't it?� She reaches out, grips Sue by her wrist cuff and leads her away.

I want to yell out, �No! No, it's number Fifty, number Fifty is your slooga, it's me,� but I can see it would do no good. Sue just nods and follows Ylena as she leaves the room. 

Jo catches me watching them leave. �Is there not enough to interest you here, Fifty?� she asks. 

�Sorry, Mistress,� is all I can manage.

�Right. Now listen to me the pair of you.&nbsp; We have guests for lunch. People that are coming to see how we do things here. You two will be waiting at table as I said. This is what you will be wearing.�

She passes us each a box. I'm excited, I haven't worn anything since I arrived. Even some fetish waitress uniform will be a wonderful change, I think. As I open the box, I realise I shouldn't have got my hopes up. There's a pair of Greek looking sandals, a strappy thing I don&#8217;t recognise and a badge with the words, �Hi, I'm Fifty How Can I Serve You?�

�Put on your sandals and I will help you with your muzzles, Jo says. �And hurry up. Our guests will be here soon.� 

We do as she tells us. It doesn't take long. Then, Jo goes to work with the straps. First, she pulls a shaped leather piece across my mouth and the lower half of my face. There's a strap around my forehead, two others run up across the top of my head from just in front of my ears, two more straps go up either side of my nose to meet in the middle of my forehead and a single strap from there runs up over the top of my scalp. My head is caged in leather straps that hold the muzzle across my mouth very firmly in place. As Jo tightens the straps, it's clear that I can't even flex my jaw, much less say anything recognisable. It's a curious sensation. My whole head feels closed in, clamped tightly by the leather. This of course is typical of Inward Bound. Breakfast was quite a while ago, our tummies will be reminding us that we should be having some sort of lunch, mean-while we are going to be surrounded by much more interesting food that is given to us and we are going to be kept from temptation and even from conversation by a muzzle. Able to serve others, but kept securely in our places.

Once the muzzle is on, a belt goes around my waist and then she clips my wrists cuffs to it behind my back. I'm not sure how I'm supposed to wait at table, if I can't use my hands. But, with the muzzle across my mouth I can't ask, either. She follows this up with a strap around my elbows. Ouch! It's painful as she pulls it tight. It's good for my posture though, I guess, as it pulls my shoulders back. 

Jo looks at me and nods with satisfaction before doing the same to Carrie. She has the two of us stand side by side and looks us over. I see her look down at the boxes. She realises that we aren't wearing our name badges and picks them up.&nbsp; She clips Carrie's badge to her collar and then turns to me. She's about to do the same but then she gets a worrying twinkle in her eye and she grins. She reaches up and clips it to my nose ring instead; the badge is just dangling in front of my muzzle. I don't know why I should feel this looks any more ridiculous than the rest of my outfit looks anyway, but I do. I manage a grunt of protest which Jo, of course, ignores.

�Good,� says Jo. �Now we'd better get your trays.� She leaves us for a moment and comes back carrying two trays and a series of lengths of chain. She starts off by fitting a tray onto me. The arrangement is quite ingenious. Two clips on the back edge of the tray fasten to rings on my belt, chains from the front two corners of the tray run up and clip to my collar. Jo fits a tray on to Carrie as well. �Now,� she says. �Your job is simple. Just go to the servery over there. They will load your tray. You then walk out to the terrace and go around the tables, pausing at each to allow them to take anything that they want. I'm sure I don't need to tell you the consequence of dropping things, spilling things or upsetting our guests. I know you saw how disappointed Ylena was that none of you had earned any demerits yet.� There's the sound of people chatting from outside the hall. �Right. Out of here. Go into the servery. You're waitresses, go and wait.� 

The two of us shuffle out as best we can, the trays swinging awkwardly from the waist clips and chains. I'm sure we'll not be able to carry anything to the tables. In the servery food is being organised, bottles of wine are being opened. The two cooks look up with an approving grin as we enter. I watch Carrie walk up and down, trying to get the hang of keeping her balance and keeping the tray steady. I decide that's a smart move and do the same thing myself.

Through the door from the servery, I can hear a presentation going on. Jo and Gerry are talking, describing the regime that we have here and how they expect their charges to behave. There is another young woman that I have not met, although I have seen her in the house. She seems to be in overall charge. I try to get a bit closer to hear more of what&#8217;s going on. As I reach the door there&#8217;s a beep &#8211; another sensor, detecting my chip, I realise. Moments later, one of the �keepers� is at my side. 

�I don&#8217;t think you&#8217;re needed here, are you, Fifty,� he says. �Why don&#8217;t you get back to what you&#8217;re supposed to be doing?� I realise he&#8217;s been alerted by the RFID monitoring system. They really do know where I am and where I should, or shouldn&#8217;t be. He takes me firmly be the arm and leads me away from the presentation room.

Eventually, the presentation finishes. There's a round of applause. Charlotte appears at the door of the servery and gives a thumbs up sign to the cooks. One of them nods and beckons Carrie and me across. �Right, you two,� he says. �Time to go to work. I hope you've got the hang of those outfits.� He starts to load food onto my tray, bowls of tasty looking nibbles. It's all I can do to stop myself drooling, but my muzzle at least makes sure I don't. So much of the food we've had has been rather Spartan, still, I&#8217;m loosing my puppy fat and that can&#8217;t be a bad thing.

�Off you go,� he says, giving my naked backside a pat. �Come back when they've finished that lot.�

I start towards the door. It's difficult moving quickly and coping with the tray, but I manage it.&nbsp; A door from the servery leads into the hall. The door has been wedged open and a screen now stands in front to defend the servery from full public view. I snake my way through, managing to keep the tray steady and glad I do not have to push the door&nbsp; open with my shoulder. 

In the main hall some groups are still chatting, but most of the audience has moved out onto the terrace. I can sense that our visitors are watching me, as I make my way towards the French doors that lead out to the terrace. Groups are sitting around the tables, chatting away. The sun is shining. I feel it warm on my naked skin and I'm suddenly aware that I'm out in the open air, in full view, naked, bound, and gagged. I stop, startled for a moment by my situation. I look around. The terrace looks out across parkland. There's not another house in sight, just the shrubs and trees of the garden. It is,of course, just as I remember it from yesterday. I recover myself and focus once more on my task. It looks like there's two or three of the faculty on each table, two or three guests. I make my way to the nearest.

Jo and Gerry are holding forth whilst a blonde rather cool woman, is questioning them. �So, do you find there is much of a drop out rate?� the woman asks and then says, �Ah, good, food,� as I arrive alongside her. She picks a selection of snacks from my tray and puts them on her plate. She turns back to Gerry, ignoring me. �I'd have thought that might be a problem.�

�No, Doctor Jordan,� Gerry is his usual expansive self, �once they're here they seem to like it.&nbsp; We do try to make sure they know what they are in for before they come and we try to screen out those that we don't think will stay the course. I don't think we've had more than two drop out since we started.�

�Maybe you aren't making things hard enough for them,� the black woman says with a mischievous grin. I edge a little further around the table. Gerry takes some food. Jo joins the conversation. 

�Don't forget our participants are all here willingly,� she says. �There's a narrow line between giving them a stretching experience and having them feeling they're being abused.� 

�And, ah repeat business?� continues Dr. Jordan.

�Yep, we are now getting a trickle of slaves coming back for what you might call further training &#8211; in fact we have a couple of them right now., A second course is more challenging for us, because we have to be ingenious enough to work out some different moves and I guess this is one of the areas where we would place further investment.�

I've got as far as the woman Jerry referred to as Doctor Jordan. She helps herself from my tray. It&#8217;s getting lighter and that makes things easier as far as I'm concerned. I'm about to move on when she tells me to stop. She reaches up to the badge hanging from my nose ring and twists it so that she can see what it says. She smiles and lets it go. She turns back to Jo, �So, are all your programmes based on behavioural techniques, or do you ever need to use drugs in any way?�

Jo looks shocked. �No. No, nothing like that. It's all just based on conventional training approaches. It&#8217;s much like we use on the corporate side of the business,. with some adjustments, of course, as you've seen.� Gerry takes some food and my tray is more or less empty. I'm still standing by the table. Jo looks at me and waves me away impatiently. I head back to the servery.

Inside, my tray is loaded up again and I return to the hall and&nbsp; my shoulder and arms are stiff from being strapped as they are and my neck is stiff too from taking the weight of the tray. As I emerge from the servery, I see Ylena look up at me and instinctively stiffen my posture. I will show her what good slave I can be, how well I can do as I am told. I am sure there must have been some mistake that she took Sue this morning. She could not have forgotten that I am her slave. She must know how it makes me feel to see her with another slave. Or, perhaps she does... My rational, analytical, self resurfaces from the depths. I am not the only slave here. Ylena is here doing a job. She's not here as my personal coach. I am paying for this &#8211; well actually Angela&#8217;s endowment fund is paying for this -&nbsp; and I am an academic research worker doing under cover field work. There, I feel better for that! But I still feel jealous about Ylena... 

Carrie is working her way around a table, much as I had before. I take my tray to another table. Charlotte is talking with some of the guests. There's a youngish looking man, in his mid thirties, I guess, a woman in her late twenties and a very cool looking woman with piercing eyes. �Did you see all you wanted to this morning, Elly?� Jo says.

The cool looking woman responds. �Mm, yes, thanks. You've got an interesting set up here. It just shows that if you get what you offer right, you'll get people to sign up for it.�

�That's what marketing is all about, Elly,� the man chimes in. �I think that Corinne has got her product pretty much right.�

I move around to let Elly select some food. The younger woman, Corinne,&nbsp; - the one who seemed in charge during the presentation earlier - smiles modestly. �I'd like to pretend that we'd thought it all out before hand,� she says, �but really, it&#8217;s grown up bit by bit. One of the things this investment is doing is to let us think properly about the way we do things. And, I have been particularly careful to have the right people with the right sort of special expertise, for example Ylena and Celia.�

�Yes,� replies Elly, �I have been admiring Celia&#8217;s work. I do like your slave&#8217;s pierced nipples! Very neatly done. And, this one's nose ring, too!� She gestures at me. I blush, but I am almost proud to have been noticed. 

�Mmmm,� continued Corrine. �Well it seemed the right thing to do. I asked Celia to make sure they were all done for your coming.� She turns towards the man. �You know Larry, your people are all surprisingly well tuned in to all this. I'd expected them to be a bit shocked, I guess, but they're all taking it in their stride.�

Larry doesn't respond to this, but Charlotte gestures to me to take my tray around to the man. �Have something to eat, Larry,� she says.

The man smiles but shakes his head. �It all looks great, but this sort of stuff is a disaster for me,� he says. �I just have to look at it and I can hear the weight going on. I like the waitress though.� He reaches out and runs a finger down the outside of my thigh. I'm shocked by his casual acceptance of the way I'm standing naked, muzzled and helpless beside him. �How come she's naked while the other one gets to keep her clothes ? �

Charlotte grins. �Number Fifty here didn't follow instructions when she joined, I'm afraid, and now she's paying the price. We like our guests to see that what happens to them springs at least in part from their own behaviour. That was one of Corinne&#8217;s basic ideas when she set this up.� Charlotte catches me listening to their conversation. �You've finished here, Fifty,� she says. �Take what's left back.�

I make my way back towards the servery winding my way between the tables, catching snippets of conversation as I go.&nbsp; �Well, yes, the cells are pretty basic, but we think that's the best way to get them used to the idea of slavery early on.� ...&nbsp; �Yes, the extra investment will let us build another 5 cells, so we can double the number of participants on a course. We&#8217;ll start the construction at the end of this course.� � �We try to make sure that they are kept busy. Of course, we get the benefit of their efforts for the other business, but that's not really the purpose of it.� � �And, you're finding that there are enough coming forward to fill the places you've got?� ... �Yes, we&#8217;ve got enough enquiries, so that we can fill ten places on the next three courses and we&#8217;re finding that quite a few of our &#8216;guests&#8217; want to come back for a second course; it&#8217;s addictive!� � �Tell me about the RFID implants you have been placing. Have you always done that or is that new?� The two groups, the faculty and the visitors, seem to be getting on famously. As far as I can tell the event has been a success.

It&#8217;s evening now and I&#8217;m back in my cell, �officially� running through the day&#8217;s events in my mind in preparation for my research report, but actually looking critically at more personal feelings.

I really enjoyed today: being naked and noticed by the guests, being tempted by food but restrained from satisfying myself. Enjoying doing a simple job really well. Enjoying being obedient and being seen to be obedient. I could really be at home in this environment. But then, this could not last for ever, could it? It&#8217;s odds-on that sooner or later being a humble domestic would pall and I would pine for something more challenging. And then, there&#8217;s Joe. Wouldn&#8217;t it be wonderful if somehow I were doing it to please him? Or, he had sent me here and what I did for Inward Bound, I were really doing for Joe. 


&nbsp;&nbsp; 


Chapter 16: Getting What She Came For

FCE Internal Memo: 

Confidential:&nbsp; Elly to Larry

Freddie and I have just discussed the team&#8217;s views after the Inward Bound event.

We are all very impressed with what has been achieved. The infrastructure and investment are both very much in order, but the crucial issue is the quality and (in this case) the originality of the staff and that&#8217;s excellent. All in all, our visit confirms the feelings expressed at the Board Meeting: this is a very important initiative and we are happy to do what is necessary to protect and nurture this project. 


Course 8 / Day 12: Course Progress Meeting

Participant Notes: Fifty

J: She has handled the cleaning and domestic duties reasonably, It should be time for her to move her experience up a level. Further session planned with Ylena for today. 


Jenny's Recollections 


I'm told that I have to go again to see Ylena, my Gaspazha. I imagine it will involve another beating. But, somehow, I long to see her again; to hear her soft, insistent voice. One of the escorts comes to take me from my cell. He tells me to face the wall and draws a broad belt around my waist. He buckles it tightly. He takes my wrists and cuffs them behind my back.&nbsp; He slips the hasp of a padlock through the staple on the buckle and clicks it shut.

�Turn around, Fifty,� he says flatly.

I see he's holding a leather dog's leash. He clips it to my nose ring. �Are you enjoying this, Fifty?� he says.

I blush. The truth is that I am. He knows. I don't have to say. He's holding the leash in one hand, gripping my arm with the other. I can't help comparing his decisive grip with how Joe touches me. Where Joe is tender and gentle, this man's grip is firm: not rough, not violent just very controlled, very measured, and very determined that I should do as he wants. Why do I find it so hard to be really aroused by Joe's loving touch when this man's grip makes me so wet? 

He steps away from me, turns his back and says, �Come along, Fifty,� over his shoulder. I don't have any choice but to follow him as he leads me out of my cell and along the corridor back to the centre, the leash looping down from my nose ring to his hand.

He stops outside Ylena&#8217;s room and hangs the loop of my leash on a hook beside the door. Before he goes he takes my arms and sets me back, firmly, against the wall and then&nbsp; he leaves me. Why doesn't Joe treat me like this? Why can&#8217;t I ask Joe to treat me like this?

I stand there for several minutes, not knowing what to do. Eventually, I decide to try to attract some attention from within. I lean across and tap the door gently with my forehead.
 
The door opens. It's Ylena. �Fifty! Excellent. Come in.� She reaches up and unhooks my leash. Once inside the room, she unclips the leash from my nose ring. �Now let me see you!�&nbsp; I'm standing with my head bowed; partly because that is how I have been told to behave, partly because I'm afraid she will see a brightness in my eyes as a result of my encounter with the guard and my anticipation at this encounter.

She puts her hand beneath my chin and lifts my face. �Ah, you seem much more confident today. I expect you are getting used to your position here?� I don't think she wants me to answer. �Do you remember our last meeting?�

I nod, �Da, Gaspazha,� I say remembering to use the Russian.

�And do you remember what you are?�

�Da, Gaspazha. Vash slooga.� I drop my eyes. It seems the only thing to do, acknowledging that I am her slave.

Ylena smiles. �Bravo, little one, bravo. Do you remember what I promised you the last time?�

I bite my lip and nod. �Da, Gaspazha.� 

�Good. Today I begin to teach you how to take a good caning. Today. Now. How do you feel about that?�

�Nervous, Gaspazha.� I'm almost disappointed that I don't know the Russian word for how I feel. 

�Nervous? Good, that&#8217;s excellent. It will heighten your experience. Now, I think you know where to go.�

I make my way through to the red and blue room and over to the spanking horse. I lay myself down across it. Obediently. Without protest. Without even the need for further urging. I know that there will be pain. That this will leave me sore. Even so, I bend across the horse, trusting Gaspazha to take care of me.
 
She unlocks the padlock that holds my wrists to my belt, takes it off and methodically straps me on to the spanking horse. And, I lay there, my belly against the cool leather of the horse, and allow her to do it. Without protest. Am I just becoming chronically obedient or trusting or secretly looking forward to my ordeal? If I am honest the answer is all of them. I am greedy for sensation! Like having the largest box of chocolates, but knowing someone else has to choose them and pass them to me. 

Ylena strokes the nape of my neck. That touch alone is almost enough to make me whimper. I sense that she realises that too. �So, moi slooga. First, I shall warm your bottom because the cane on a cold unprepared bottom is very bad news indeed. Like when you exercise you must warm up your muscles, so it is with beating. Understand, moi slooga.�
 
She begins. First a hand spanking, short firm slaps then heavier blows, slow pats and rapid swats. Then comes a strap, then a tawse. Never hard blows, just rapid slaps, they hurt but not badly. 

Then, comes a small whip. �Look at this moi slooga, see how small this is.� And it is, the grip no bigger than her hand, the tail no longer than her forearm. �But, small things can be very effective can they not, moi slooga.� The blows come quickly, back and forth, hard then soft then hard again, left buttock then right, working up from the base working down from the top. Every one of my senses is tuned to what Ylena is doing to me.

After this preparation, I am gasping, squirming and enjoying it. I can feel sweat trickle down from my back around my belly and down onto the leather of the horse. I'm not just enjoying this &#8211; that&#8217;s not a strong enough word. I try to stand aside psychologically &#8211; to revisit my analytical self &#8211; and watch my reactions objectively &#8211; but I can&#8217;t be objective. I'm not just enjoying it. I'm lost in it. Abandoned to it. Unaware of anything beyond, Ylena, me, the spanking horse and Ylena's toys. The sensation is extraordinary and I know that this is why I came. I would not be anywhere else for anything.

�Ah ha! What a nice hot red bottom!� I feel Ylena's hand on my buttocks.

I can feel the results of her work and a large floor-to-ceiling mirror lets me see what is happening to me. I see Ylena wearing the same leather skirt and bustier that she wore before. I can feel what she has done, but I cannot see the results of Gaspazha&#8217;s efforts yet.&nbsp; And besides, she hasn't finished.

I watch with trepidation and anticipation as she picks a cane from the rack on the wall. She swishes it through the air.

�Well, Fifty, the cane! Have you been caned before? I think not?�

�No, Gaspazha.�

�Pardon?� Ylena's tone is indignant.

�Nyet spaseeba Gaspazha.�

�Better. This is not a good time to forget what I have taught you, is it?�

�Nyet, Gaspazha.�

�Nyet! So, I think I shall start with six of this light cane.�
 
She takes up a position behind me.

�Are you ready moi slooga?�

�Da, Gaspazha, I think.�

�Time to learn a new word, moi slooga. You know the word for 'please'? It's 'pazh&#8217;alsta'.�

�Pazh&#8217;alsta?�&nbsp; 

Before the word is out of my mouth, I hear the swish. I look up at the mirror as the cane connects with my bottom. It feels hot and bright, stinging and burning. But nice. I can't believe I think that. It feels nice. It's not nearly as bad as I feared it might be. I feel curiously light-headed, almost drunk.

A second, third and fourth stroke connects, each separated by perhaps thirty seconds of rest.
I am breathing in shallow gasps now. It may be pleasurable, but there is still pain and the pain is building into a wave crashing onto me. It's not unbearable, but I hope she will let the wave crash and recede &#8211;&nbsp; and she does.

Ylena walks around to my head and crouches down so she can look me straight in the eyes. �
Just two more, Fifty,� she says. 

She walks back to stand behind me. The first of two! AHHHHH! I bite my lip. That hurt. She waits and saws the cane slowly back and forth across my bottom like a violinist drawing their bow across their instrument. It feels good and the respite feels better.

The second blow comes without warning. AHHHH HHHHHA! I squeeze my buttocks together in response as the final stroke of the six burns its way into my bum. I realise there is no more to come. I relax onto the horse, breathing heavily, like an athlete after a hard run is over.

�Well. moi slooga? Did you enjoy that, little one?�

She has finished, but she doesn't unstrap me from the horse.

�Da, Gaspazha, spaseeba! It was much better for vash slooga than I thought it would be.�

�Hmmm. Better is not necessarily the sensation I was trying for. Still different canes feel different and after you have had a short rest you can try another.�

Another one? She leaves me strapped to the spanking horse, the leather padding sticky against my sweaty belly. The prospect of more caning should be really frightening, but I am amazed to find myself completely calm, as I think about what is to happen next. I shiver, my sweat evaporating has chilled my skin, but here is Ylena to warm it again.

I watch her in the mirror as she chooses from the rack, picking canes, one after another, weighing them in her hand bending them and testing their springiness. Replacing one and selecting another. Trying that and returning to the first. Trying another and deciding on that. I&#8217;m sure she is doing this to torment me, but as I watch in the mirror it's almost as if Ylena is in a different room and I'm looking through a window into another room not into a mirror into this one. I feel her choices have nothing to do with me; that what is happening now and what will happen soon have no connection.

Then she is standing beside my head, her skirt inches from my face, the smell of the leather filling my nostrils. She strokes my scalp. �This cane is heavier, moi slooga &#8211; see how the noise it makes is different as I swish it through the air. This is more, more thuddy. It will bruise you deeper, and it will make your bottom sore for longer &#8211; tomorrow and the next day.�

She says nothing more. Before I know it, the second cane has licked across my bum, and the sensation really is different. The difference makes it easier to bear. It burns too, but there is a deeper, broader, quality to the pain. Almost like a deep massage. Two, three, then four strokes each delivered slowly, deliberately. In my mind is the picture of waves gathering, ready to rush to shore and crash onto the beach.

Gaspazha waits.

The sea calms. It draws back from the beach.

A fifth stroke!

I am breathing deeply and heavily.

A sixth stroke!

The wave of pain crashes over me. I am clenching , unclenching , clenching my buttocks and squealing, whimpering, sobbing with the pain.

There's a hand on my neck and my back, rubbing soothing, calming ���..

�Well done, moi slooga. Well done, Fifty. Twelve strokes of the cane and moments ago you were a cane virgin.�

She wipes my eyes. Tears or perspiration? I cannot tell.

�Spaseeba, Gazpazha.� A sob escapes my lips.

�Pazh&#8217;alsta!� Ylena says, �It also means, 'you&#8217;re welcome'. Pazh&#8217;alsta. You took your cane very well. Fifty, I am proud of you! Now for pleasing vash Gaspazha, moi slooga has a reward.�
 
I feel Gaspazha loosen the strap across my back that holds me to the horse. She slides something between my legs.&nbsp; It feels like a sort of shield covering my pussy. It's firm, but not cold. Leather perhaps, or plastic. She fastens elastic straps to my belt to hold it in place. Then I feel her finger pushing the shield to one side, slipping her finger beneath it. Her finger&nbsp; - moist and slippery &#8211; spreads my lips out under the shield. I've never been touched there by a woman but even so, throughout this, I lay there, calm and passive. Accepting. Her slave.�

A moment later there is something cool on my anus and I feel as a rubber gloved finger circles my bud and presses inwards. Whether because of my caning or some animal arousal, my sphincter relaxes and I let her finger glide inside. She works her finger gently inside me around and around, side to side. This is very new ground and it feels so surprisingly good. Why did Joe never do this to me? Why did he never cane me? Did I ask? Would I have allowed him? Perhaps we were just too shy of each other?

Now, something else is gently probing my anus. Something harder. There's the sensation of a&nbsp; bump as something slips through. Then, another and another.

�Fifty, have you ever tried playing with electrics?�

�No, I&#8217;m sorry, Nyet, Gaspazha!� Her words pull me back from my reverie. It's as if I have&nbsp; suddenly woken up. I'm afraid, but somehow I feel that Ylena won't let her slave come to harm. �Er, what are you going to do?� I start to say, but coherent speech is abruptly cut off�..
 
�AaaAAAAHHHHH!� There's a delicious tingling, pulsing sucking feeling that runs across my vagina. I start giggling and laughing. The sensation runs through me again and again; gradually more and more intense.

Then, �AAAAAAHHHHH,� deep inside my bum another wiggling pricking pulsing exquisite sensation begins.

Ylena's voice is quiet and close to my ear. �Do you like that, moi slooga?�

�AAAAHHHH, AHHHH, AHHHH.� I can hardly speak, it's like a fountain gushing across my vagina and inside my rectum. �YES,YES, Yes,� I gasp, in time with the sensations.

Gaspazha chuckles, obviously pleased with my reactions. �A little more, I think.�

�Yes, please, please,� I beg. �AAAAAHHHH. Gaspazha?�

�Yes, Fifty.�

�Gaspazha, will you cane me again &#8211; AAAAAAHHHH &#8211; vash slooga begs you.�

�Pardon?�

�Will you cane me again? Please. Pazh&#8217;alsta. �

�Of course, perhaps next week?�

�No, please,� the sensations in my pussy and my arse continue. �AAAAAHHHHH, please. Pazh&#8217;alsta, Gaspazha, cane me now!� I can hardly believe I am saying this: the afterglow from Gaspazha&#8217;s previous attentions plus the astonishing sensations created by the electrical stimulation blend together and and and AAAAHHH, I just want to feel the stinging burning cane again!.

�Pazh&#8217;alsta, moi slooga, pazh&#8217;alsta.� She picks up one of the canes and stands behind me.
The waves of stimulation continue to pulse through me. I can't believe that I have begged her to beat me more, but the sensations she has provoked have made me throw any caution I had to the winds.

The cane smacks hard across my bum &#8211; and I love it!

�Oh!�

Another stroke; �OH!�

Another stroke; �OHH!�

And another and another and another!

I am pressing my bum against the straps which hold me, lifting it towards the fiery kisses of Gaspazha&#8217;s beautiful cane.
&nbsp; 
�There, Fifty! Another six. Would you like more?�

It seems impossible for me to say anything else. �Oh, yes please! Pazh&#8217;alsta Gaspazha.�

�Six?�

�Plea AAAAHHH. Pazh&#8217;alsta!�

�So, the heavier cane this time��� 

From somewhere far away or so it seems comes the sensation of another, six, slow, firm, burning cuts across by bum and once more, like a runner finishing a race, there is complete exhausting satisfaction!

Finally, Gaspazha completes my caning and powers down the electrical stimulation unit.
I hang tired, throbbing, burning across the horse. I am wet with sweat and even though the room is warm, I start to shiver again.

Gaspazha unstraps me, then helps me down from the horse. My legs have turned to jelly and I sink to my knees. She wraps a warm towel around me, crouching beside me, holding me close to her and whispering, �moi slooga,�

I have had, quite simply, the most erotic exhausting time I can remember. I know that I will do absolutely anything this woman asks me to do: lick her feet, wear her brand or tattoo, make love to another girl, be her slave for ever, just anything!

�I think moi slooga enjoyed herself?�

�Oh, Da, Gaspazha. Spaseeba!�

�Excellent, I think you are beginning to get what you came for. But, I think you can do more. We will have to see how far you can go, won't we moi slooga? You know you will be beaten for your de-merits, don&#8217;t you?� I nod, remembering that I had 130 points before today&#8217;s session started. Gaspazha hasn&#8217;t said that my beatings today have reduced the total at all. �Now, we know how you respond to beating we can punish you appropriately.&nbsp; Who knows where it will all end?�

Who indeed, I think. One thing I am sure of; I&#8217;m finding it increasingly difficult to spend time thinking about the research project. I&#8217;m swallowed up by everything that&#8217;s going on here in my life as a slave.
 


Chapter 17: The Tattooing Incident

Course 8 / Day 15: Course Progress Meeting

Participant Notes: Fifty

Jo: At yesterday&#8217;s review we agreed that Fifty was ready for her next experience. Charlotte has agreed to mentor her through this with Jonathan providing the technical input. We have scheduled Fifty&#8217;s tattooing for today, assuming she consents as we anticipate. It worked well for those on the last course, and like them, we expect this will help Fifty to confront issues of trust and the need to surrender to her new slave identity. She has given outline consent and Charlotte will begin by asking Fifty to provide a confirmation.


Jenny&#8217;s Recollections:

I am in my cell. The shutter is up so it&#8217;s open to the corridor through the bars. Charlotte comes.

She looks cool, calm; the epitome of Scandinavian elegance. She is dressed in a polo shirt, cut-off cargo pants and polished black thick soled leather loafers. There&#8217;s the heavy, sweet, fine, aura of Santa Maria Novella; the same scent she was wearing when we first met.

She unlocks the door with a swipe card, comes in and sits on my bed. She motions me to sit and I kneel at her feet.

She slips her feet out of her shoes, to draw them up onto the mattress, but instinctively (now) I lean forward and begin to kiss her feet. 

They are beautiful feet; lightly tanned, no calluses, nails carefully trimmed, a toe ring on one foot and an ankle bracelet on the opposite ankle. They smell warm with the scent of leather, from her shoes.

Suddenly, I raise my head and smile broadly. I am rushing back to the normal in control, analytical, me. �You know, Charlotte, I never dreamed ��

She cuts me off. �SHHHH, little one.� She lays one hand on my head. �Shhhh. Stay where you were. Where you were ��

And I&#8217;m back as a slave once again, but with tears in my eyes now. Charlotte pushes my head gently down and I resume: kissing licking, rubbing my lips against her feet.

�Now, that&#8217;s good Fifty. Doesn&#8217;t that seem good to you?�

And it does seem good. Appropriate. Safe. Correct. I'm always happy here, caring for my Mistresses. It's funny. I have no problem with this; crouching at the feet of Charlotte, or Jo. Some of the other girls find this aspect of their slavery the hardest. They can cope with the bondage or the beatings, but they find it had to submit at this intensely personal level. Sue collected ten demerits yesterday for being slow to massage Charlotte's feet when ordered. Anna earned punishment for defying Ylena over something similar. For me, though, these services are the fulfilment of everything else:, the reason for the bondage and the beatings, the reward for the household duties, the honour of slavery. And then, I think, �Why can't I do this for Joe?�

Charlotte interrupts my thoughts. �Well done, little one. Well done. Now ��

It takes a moment to realise that she is trying to attract my attention. �Yes, Mistress?�

�Fifty: we would like you to take a souvenir home with you.�

�But, surely it&#8217;s not time for me to go home?�

�No, but some souvenirs need time and occasionally some need special consent.�

�From me?�

�Mmmmm, even from you. You know we do nothing that you have not consented to.�

She's right, of course.

�For your souvenir, we would like you to be tattooed. Would you like that?�

My first reaction is, I'm not sure. Actually, it's something I had never thought of. Of course, I had noticed other girls with various tattoos, some very attractive, some a bit tacky, and there are the tattoos that Judith and Anna have, but I never thought of having one myself ���.

�Er, I well, well I mean I never thought of it ��..I mean it might depend on what, on where .... erm what did you have in mind?�

�Of course, Fifty, we come back to the 'trust' question now. Would you trust us to do the best by you?�

I think about it for a moment. Actually, I do trust them. Even so, it&#8217;s a big step. I think back to the tattoos that I saw on Judith and Anna. �Yes, Mistress. I do,� I say but I need some reassurance. �Would it be something like the ones that Judith and Anna wear?�

Charlotte understands my worries. �Fifty, we know that your consent has to be informed. I will tell you this. Whatever we do would be hidden under your normal clothes. Nothing in the design would be obscene or offensive in any way. It will be done by a professional tattoo artist who would be proud to point to his work afterwards.�

What she says reassures me. I can see that she&#8217;s waiting for my answer, The look on her face is at once understanding of my dilemma, accepting of the sense of my concerns and disappointment that I am not more ready to demonstrate my trust. 

�I&#8217;m sorry, it&#8217;s just not something I ever really thought of.�

�No, but we have thought of it for you. Will you trust us?�

�Yes Charlotte &#8211; sorry - Mistress.�

Charlotte leans forward and strokes my scalp. �Good,� she says. �Don&#8217;t worry it will be all right. I&#8217;ll send Jonathan to see you. Now you were �?�

I smile and lean forward again to kiss lick and rub my lips against her feet. In spite of the uncertainty, the tingle of apprehension, here I feel safe and right. 

After Charlotte has gone, I have another visitor. Jonathan. I saw him on my last visit to see Celia. 

He smiles broadly. �Hi, Fifty. I have come to talk about your tattoo. Stand up.�

I stand.

�Turn around �.. and again �.slowly. No stand up straight. Raise your arms. Now bend over. Hmmmmm. OK, let's do that again, and I&#8217;ll photograph you.�

I repeat the routine accompanied by clicks from Jonathan's digi-cam.

�OK, thank you, Fifty. I will work up a design on these and I will come for you later.�

�Sir,� I ask, �what will it look like and where will it be?�

Jonathan smiles. �To be absolutely honest, I haven&#8217;t decided yet. The very best and most artistic tattoos tend to be bold and simple. They're often quite a bit larger than their owners originally had in mind.� His eyes twinkle as he sees me bite my lip at this suggestion. �Although you have given your consent and you have agreed to leave the design up to us,. of course, I do remember you are a girl. Don't worry, Heavy Metal Biker or old fashioned Sailor imagery would not look right for you and cartoon characters are not appropriate for your personality either ��

Relief must have shown in my face, because he flashes a broad smile at me. �So I have to go and review possibilities. Positions and of course,� he pauses, �size. Then, I will know just what to create that will be right for a slave like you.�

I&#8217;m beginning to feel a knot of anxiety and anticipation somewhere between my tummy and my clit!

�I thought you used transfers from books and just tattooed over them?�

�That&#8217;s the way it always used to be. It is still used a lot. It's called Flash. Sometimes Flash can look really good. But, that's not what we're going to do for you, Fifty. I like to develop individual designs for my clients&nbsp; - you can be a client on this occasion.� He smiles again.

�How long will it take? Will it hurt? �

�Not compared to a session with Ylena!� he laughs and sees me blush. �Well, it will be uncomfortable in places. If I'm tattooing where the skin is thin, over bone, it can be worse and of course it can go on for a long time.&nbsp; Relatively small designs can be done in one session, but yours will probably take several sessions.� He must see how nervous that makes me feel, is he planning to cover my entire body? He ignores my anxiety and carries on. �I might decide to see you at my studio after you are released, depending on the final design.� 

After my release � I have had so much to think about that �release� and return to normal life seems a completely alien idea. But now there is this new idea that my &#8216;experience� won't end with release � that my time here will cast a shadow into the future. My hair will grow back, the pale marks from my cuffs and collar will fade, the scar from my implant will disappear, even my piercings could heal over but this will be visible always. Just how long will the shadow of Inward Bound actually be, I wonder? I am more than a bit concerned. I am actually feeling quite scared. When I started this I thought that the big problem was going to be coping with what ever they threw at me as part of the �experience�. Then I thought that trying to be objective enough to come up with something that would relate to a research agenda would be a problem. (All right &#8211; that has been a problem, I know). And I thought about the problems that I was going to have with Angela when I got back. And Joe. What I haven&#8217;t thought about, until now, was me and how all this was going to affect me&nbsp; And now that I do, I am scared.


The rest of the day and the day after follows the usual pattern here. Housework, kitchen duties, serving the Mistresses and gardening. The beeps from my RFID chip every time I go through a door. I do seem to be getting an overall tan. What will Joe think of it? Actually, how am I going to explain any of this to Joe?

Three days later, after breakfast, Jo tells me I have an appointment with Jonathan and the knot in my stomach returns in an instant. She cuffs my wrists together, clips a leash to my nose ring and takes me to Celia&#8217;s room. She hangs the leash on the coat hook outside the door &#8211; as Jo did when I last went to see Ylena &#8211; and I just have to wait until Jonathan himself shows up. He smiles his broad smile and goes in to the room leaving me outside for a while longer. After a few minutes he comes out again, unclips my leash and takes me inside.

�Now, Fifty, I need absolute cooperation. I can&#8217;t work properly with you strapped down, if you are to be decorated to the highest standards. I think you will understand that. Are you prepared to lay still for me?�

�Yes, Sir.�

�Good girl. Lay on the plinth.� He indicates a medical styled, lightly padded, adjustable &#8216;bed&#8217;, well to the side of Celia&#8217;s dental chair. The medical room is really rather bigger than I had remembered. The &#8216;plinth&#8217; is exactly what a physiotherapist might use &#8211; I suppose that was where they got the idea of it. It&#8217;s upholstered in a darker leather like material (as I learned later because the tattooing inks can be hard to remove from lighter coloured material.)

After I am flat on the plinth, Jonathan sponges my skin with warmish water to dampen it and lays a sheet of what looks like tracing paper on top and another adjoining and another and another. I can feel my panic rising as he covers more and more of my back, then my hip and finally the top of my leg, with the paper.

�These are stencils Fifty, made from the overall design which I then printed up to life size. Today I shall tattoo the outline and on later visits I can do the filling in. That&#8217;s the part which will take time and it&#8217;s probably best done at intervals over the next few months.�

�That&#8217;s a long time!� I&#8217;m feeling that I&#8217;ve been stupid to agree to this and that maybe I should back out now.

�Yes, but your skin needs time to recover between sessions. It&#8217;s not like spreading paint on a canvas. And I would actually like you to enjoy the experience as well as the end result.�

Jonathan&#8217;s remarks make perfect sense and they are reassuring too. My irrational rational self reasserts itself. �There,� I hear my stupid, rational, self say to my more cautious, irrational but sensible self, �he says it&#8217;s all right so it will be and you can see he&#8217;s concerned for your well being so what problem could there possibly be?� 

As so often, my stupid rational self wins out.

�So,� I say, �let&#8217;s get started ��.�

Jonathan peels each stencil carefully from me and begins by spreading Vaseline across the area of skin he intends to work on. His design &#8211; whatever it is &#8211; is frighteningly extensive. He starts at my shoulder and moves sinuously over my back, down to my buttocks and off down one leg. Gee, this is going to be so big, I&#8217;ll never be able to get this lasered off if I take against it. The sensation of being tattooed seems to depend on where he is working. Sometimes it's prickly, sometimes sharp, sometimes just a buzzing sensation and sometimes really not nice at all. He gives me regular breaks and from time to time, rubs the target area with more Vaseline. The rubbing is a great relief and feels very comforting. We even stop for tea on a couple of occasions, as well as taking short breaks. It feels like being in the real world once again.

After the second tea break, Jonathan gives me a progress report, �That&#8217;s the outline of the principle design done!�

�There is more?�

�Ah ha!�

�Oh ��

�Don&#8217;t worry, you will love it when it&#8217;s finally done. So will your Owner.�

Owner! I get the now familiar sexual stab of pleasure at the word: �Owner�! The only question is who is my owner? Is it Joe, or is it Inward Bound?

�The last thing I&#8217;m going to do today is to complete one section at the bottom of your back. It's your bar code. It matches the number on your chip.�

�Oh ��

�Don't worry, it's well integrated into the design and will not look at all out of place.&nbsp; In fact, it will look just like a part of the second level decoration unless you know what to look for. Now, let me just check.�

He takes a small pistol like device and points it at the scar on my arm where the RFID chip is buried. There&#8217;s a beep and Jonathan looks at the device. 

�Fine,� he says. �At least I&#8217;ve got the right number. It wouldn&#8217;t do for your chip to say one thing and your bar code to say another. That way lies schizophrenia!� he laughs. 

Well, I suppose it&#8217;s a relief that he thought of that but, even so, the bar code does not feel inconspicuously small to me, as Jonathan works on it. First he lays down another transfer stencil and then performs a check scan. The actual tattooing takes a long time. I suppose it&#8217;s got to be pin-point (Ha!) accurate if it&#8217;s going to scan properly, but I&#8217;m really glad when it&#8217;s done.
 
Jonathan sprays my skin with water again and places cling-film dressings over the areas he has worked on. The session is over and I&#8217;m very glad. Excruciating? No, but enough is enough! I&#8217;m sent off to my cell to rest up for the remainder of the day and towards the end of the afternoon, Jonathan reappears. He has me shower, and the cling film dressings peel away. He very gently soaps my skin (which feels rather rough and very tender now) and pats me dry with a soft towel before spraying on a final layer of skin dressing.

It is later on that I get the first reaction to Jonathan&#8217;s work.

�Jenny! �� bloody hell! Have you seen yourself?�

I&#8217;m having my evening meal with the rest of the girls and they are evidently impressed by Jonathan&#8217;s efforts. Even Judith and Anna applaud, which is worrying. 

�No, actually I haven&#8217;t.&nbsp; What&#8217;s it like?�

�It&#8217;s absolutely fantastic. You lucky sod!�

I finally get to see it later when I sneak a few moments to look in a mirror while I&#8217;m doing duties cleaning out Charlotte&#8217;s bathroom. It is impressive; a great abstract dragon design as though something from the Book of Kells has been lifted out and laid down on my back. I&#8217;m actually quite proud of it &#8211; which is just as well. Jonathan was right about the barcode, I guess. It is hidden away in the design but, even so, I know what it is and that it is there. I feel like a piece of meat in a supermarket. But then, I suppose that&#8217;s the idea. I find the idea arousing. I suddenly have this mental image of myself sitting in a wire trolley, being wheeled out of a girl supermarket by Joe, the check-out bleeping as it rings up my price and Joe hands over the cash willingly.

Let&#8217;s hope Joe agrees with the other girls about the tattoo. I guess I could remove my piercing jewellery (though I don&#8217;t want to) and my psychological state might even return to normal one day, (outside chance) but this tattoo really is forever ������

Chapter 18: Elementary String Theory

Course 8 / Day 22: Course Progress Meeting

Participant Notes: Fifty

Ylena: Fifty's last session with me seemed to make a deep impression. Of all those on this intake, she seems to lose herself more completely in beatings than any of the others. She continues to show a willingness to follow her chosen path and to gain as many experiences as she can during her stay.

Jenny's Recollections. 

I suppose I should have expected it. Thinking back it&#8217;s surprising that there hasn&#8217;t been any of it up until now.

Ylena and Jo appear outside the cells. We&#8217;re all waiting there for the assignment of the day&#8217;s duties. Ylena and Jo are talking quietly, pointing first to the cell next door to mine and then to one of the others further down the line. I can&#8217;t hear them. Then Ylena takes out a single dice and tosses it up. Jo laughs and nods. Ylena throws the dice across the table and the two of them peer at it.

At once Jo turns to my cell and says, �You are the lucky one, Fifty. Come with us.�

She opens my cell door, clips a leash to my nose ring and I follow her and Ylena up to the gym.

�Tell me, Fifty,� Ylena begins. �Have you had experience of bondage?�

�Da, Gaspazha,� I reply. �A few times.�

�Not simple tying, just a knot or two. I mean real bondage? So you are quite immobile? Locked in the grip of ropes?�

I can see that what Gaspazha has in mind is more stringent than anything I&#8217;ve experienced before. I shake my head. �Nyet, Gaspazha. Not like that.�&nbsp; 

Ylena smiles. �Good,� she says. �So, this is a new experience for you and some learning for Jo. She wishes to see what can be done and I, I am an expert, a nawashi.� Ylena evidently isn&#8217;t waiting for me to agree or accept her suggestion. She probably won&#8217;t be concerned that I haven&#8217;t the faintest idea what a &#8216;nawashi&#8217; is either. �Now, moi slooga,� she goes on. �Over there you see those ropes. Bring them here, the brown ones. Lay them out neatly on the table.�

The ropes are in hanks on a series of hooks on one wall of the gym. They have been coiled neatly and arranged by diameter and length. They are in several colours; white, red, blue and a natural brown colour.

There are four hanks of brown rope. They are quite thin, perhaps only half an inch or so in diameter. I lay them out on the table.

�No, slooga, not like that. Lay them two on each side of the table the short ones nearer me, The long ones beneath them. In two lines.�

I do as she says, putting them in place as neatly as I can.&nbsp; Precision seems to be important. 

Ylena smiles. �Good, slooga. I am pleased the dice chose you. You take care with things.� I feel proud; pleased that such a small act has attracted my Gaspazha&#8217;s praise. �Now lay down between the two lines of rope. On your face. Hands by your sides.�

I climb up onto the table. It is the last instruction she gives me, for the rest of the time her remarks are addressed to Jo.

�Shibari is not only concerned with immobilising the subject but also with the aesthetic result of the rope applied. We do not only bind but we aim to make the binding look pleasing and the form adopted by the subject as a result of the binding should be&nbsp; pleasing too. For me I also believe that we should seek to deliver the subject up to a state of detachment from the self; to a point where they are absorbed in the sensation of being bound at the expense of all else. This we do by intricate and exquisitely tight rope work. It is tradition to use the natural rope and that is what I will use now. I like the colours though.� She nods across to the other hanks of rope. 

�I see,� says Jo.

�Yes, Three good colours. Like the Russian flag,� Ylena says with a smile. �It makes a good look but for now we will follow tradition. See, we will start with the ankles and feet.�

Ylena goes to work. I feel her draw a length of rope around one of my ankles. She winds it around the other; taking a number of turns and drawing both together immovably. She is taking great care to lay the rope precisely, so that each turn fits snugly against its neighbour. Although I cannot see what she is doing I can sense the neatness of her efforts. She takes more turns of the rope under the arches of my feet. Then I feel her pull my big toes together. A single loop of rope is sufficient to lock them in place. It is a curious sensation; my ankles and feet completely fixed but the rest of me still free and able to move, though without a word from my Gaspazha, I don&#8217;t.

�So now, the wrists,� I hear Ylena say. She binds my wrists with my palms back to back, she threads a strand around the base of each of my fingers finishing off with a knot that holds my thumbs together. With my wrists tied so, my forearms are tensed and begin to ache almost at once. 

�Please help,� Ylena says to Jo, Together the two of them bring me to a sitting position. �Now we make a karada, a rope dress.� Ylena begins weaving rope around my body, across around and between my tits, fixing my arms to my sides. She positions the knots exactly, ensuring they sit symmetrically and the each length of rope is tensioned so that it pulls equally on the others. She works her way down my body until finally she pulls the rope between my legs. She looks at it carefully and then withdraws it and ties three lumpy knots, close to one another, in the rope. She puts it back and then pulls it taut. As she ties it off to the rope around my wrists, I feel the knots slip between my moistening labial lips and know that for every movement of my arms I will be rewarded with the sensation of the knots sliding across my sex.

�There are many traditional designs,� says Ylena. �You can try them. Like a recipe book. I like to do this, too.� She takes another length of rope and ties a large knot in its centre. She eases the knot into my mouth as a gag and then fastens the rope behind my head before joining it to the rope around my wrists in such a way that my head is pulled back and I am looking at the ceiling.

�Ah,� says Jo, �and now you can see the karada better. I think I begin to understand.�

�Exactly. This is the difference between simple shibari and kinbaku-bi, the aesthetic and erotic result. See how the rope remains tight across the body. The skill is in getting the tension just right. Now we try gyaku-ebi.� Ylena moves me carefully and firmly so that I am laying on my tummy again.

�Gyaku-ebi?�

�I think when you see it you will say it is a hog-tie, but this is a very traditional kinbaku tie.� Ylena continues with more rope. To me it certainly feels like a hog-tie as my ankles are drawn back towards my wrists. �With careful design of the harness, you can suspend the slave, tsuri.� I give a groan from behind my gag. The idea of hanging naked cocooned in ropes does not appeal at all. �But I think this is too much for my little m-jo on her first time.�

I agree with her. Ylena and Jo leave me on the table while they go over to the other side of the gym. I can see that Jo and Ylena are discussing the various lengths of rope and their colours and the challenge of working only with the traditional 7 metre lengths of rope, the importance of using only those knots that were traditionally used with hemp or linen ropes. They are, of course, completely unconcerned about my comfort. Locked in the harness of rope, each of my muscles begins to call out in discomfort. The only way that I can achieve any relief is to focus on each in turn trying to ease the tension from the rope by tensing one or other muscle.

The gymnasium disappears for me. I don&#8217;t even feel the table really. It&#8217;s as if I am suspended but suspended in some formless void where I can only feel the touch of the rope and the pain in my muscles and joints. Nothing else is significant, except the rub of the rope across my crotch.

I am suddenly aware that Ylena and Jo are watching me and I have no idea of how long I have been like this and how long they have been watching as I twist and strain within my, what did Ylena call it? Oh, yes, my karada Somehow I find that even more arousing.

Ylena looks across at me as I wriggle in the rope harness. �You see how she reacts to the ropes?�

Jo replies. �It&#8217;s very effective.�

�Let me show you some others,� Ylean says. �I have a book over here.�

I give a gagged squeal of concern as the two of them leave me again. I&#8217;m perched helplessly on the table while they go off to the other side of the room, standing with their backs to me and peering at Ylena&#8217;s book. I&#8217;m worried about falling off, trying not to move more than I have to. Somehow the more I try to stay still the more I feel aware of the rope across my crotch. The slightest twitch of my body seems to pull on the rope and drag the knots across my labia. I&#8217;m getting wetter as I get more aroused and the combination of the effects of the rope and my situation soon have me panting into my gag and twitching more to pull the crotch rope against myself. Suddenly I know that I can&#8217;t stop myself. My body falls into a crashing orgasm, my thighs and belly flex against the table in response and I try to keep myself from falling off. I give a whimpering cry, distorted by the rope gag as the waves of sensation crash over me. 

The sound attracts Ylena&#8217;s attention. She and Jo turn towards me. Ylena is smiling. I feel humiliated, strung up like this and laying on the table like some scientific specimen. And Ylena&#8217;s technique worked of course. She must be feeling very pleased with herself. Suddenly I&#8217;m angry with myself and angry with her.

Ylena lays a hand gently on my head. I try to shake it free. �Hush, little m-jo,� she says. �Enjoy yourself. It&#8217;s not your fault. This is the power of the rope. Now let me free you.�

She begins to unfasten the ropes. It seems to take even longer than when she was tying me. As each length of rope is removed she coils it carefully and hangs it back in place on its hook on the wall. Eventually I am freed. The gentleness with which she has treated me as she untied me has taken away my anger. Or maybe it&#8217;s just the relaxed feeling I always have after an orgasm. �You wear the karada well, m-jo,� she says.

�Perhaps I&#8217;ll practice on her,� Jo says.

�It is the best way,� Ylena says. �Only through practice can you know how the ropes will follow the body and how the body will follow the ropes.�

Jo nods. I can see she thinks it is a good idea. I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ll have much opportunity to disagree.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Chapter 19: Sex And The Single Girl 

Course 8 / Day 26: Course Progress Meeting

Participant Notes: Fifty

Jo: The shibari demonstration that Ylena provided gave us the chance to explore Fifty&#8217;s response to bondage. In common with her other reactions she was quick to sink herself in the experience and further shibari sessions could be beneficial. Overnight surveillance has also shown Jenny helps herself off to sleep by masturbation. It is probably time to start helping her to explore her sexual boundaries and the idea of being the sexual property of her Master or Mistress,


Jenny's Recollections. 

It is after breakfast that Jo takes me to one side. She takes me up to where I can make my weekly exchange of e-mails. I&#8217;d almost forgotten that it was time to do this again. This time, I decide to drop a note to Angela - it&#8217;s inconsequential stuff, but I feel obliged to say something. There are a couple of chatty mails from Joe. His trip seems to be having all the usual problems that he tells me about, but he seems happy enough. I send him an e-mail in reply. I finish well within my fifteen minutes limit and look up towards Jo.

�All done?� she asks. I nod. �I hope you find this helpful. We think it helps to have some link back to the rest of the world.&nbsp;&nbsp; We know it can be a bit of a pressure-cooker in here. You need a little time to de-stress.�

I don&#8217;t say anything, but it doesn&#8217;t really feel like de-stressing to me. Whenever I think about the world back at the university and home, I&#8217;m just confronted by the extraordinary difference between my life there and my life here and that feels pretty stressful to me. Mind you, I&#8217;m supposed to be thinking about stress, aren&#8217;t I?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

Jo begins again, �Fifty, before you start today's work, we need to talk,� she says. I'm puzzled. Normally, Jo waits until the end of the day before we have a discussion on what has gone on and how I'm feeling. Why didn't she talk about whatever it is last night?

Jo tells me to stand and then sits herself down. She logs in with a different ID and starts up a new programme on the computer.

�I want to show you something,� Jo presses a key on the laptop. A media player window opens and a video starts to play. It looks like it&#8217;s been shot in one of the cells, shot from high up, near the .... Oh, goodness! I realise that it's my cell; that it's me in the bed in the middle of the picture. I think of the little red light that blinks in the ceiling of my cell when they put the lights out. �I'm sure you remember my telling you that we keep participants under observation from time to time,� Jo says, �just to ensure your well-being.�

I bite my lip and shake my head. I know what's coming next.

The girl in the video pushes back the blanket from her bed. It's clear that she has her hands between her legs. She's naked; how could it not be?&nbsp; I know that it's me, but it's like watching someone else. The girl arches her back, pushing her crotch forward against her hands. It's worse, the camera zooms in, the girl's hands and her crotch fill the screen.&nbsp; Jo moves the mouse and the sound comes on, too. �Ylena, Ylena, Ylena,� I am repeating over and over again. And then, �Joe, Joe, Joe.� The girl in the picture gives a whimper. She, I mean I, obviously comes and then lays back exhausted.

�It's not like you think,� I start. I'm embarrassed, but I'm also angry that they've been filming me surreptitiously.

�Isn't it? Why not?�

�Because 'Jo', isn't you. It's my husband. It's 'Joe' I'm saying, not 'Jo'. Look in my file, you'll see.�

�And what was I thinking? You said, 'It's not what you think.' I wondered what it was that you thought that I thought.�

�I, I, I,� and suddenly I realise that I don't have the slightest idea. I suppose I expected Jo to disapprove in some way. To feel that I shouldn't be doing what I was doing. And, I've felt exactly the same way about Joe too; assuming that he was making judgements about me, guessing what he feels, when actually I don't really know, because I've never really asked him.

�Look,� said Jo with concern, �we are very anxious to make sure that nothing prevents you from achieving the goals you set yourself when you came here. We know that it&#8217;s possible for sexual urges to be heightened by the situation here and we want to be sure that you have every opportunity to act out any fantasies that you have as part of the programme. There really shouldn't be a need for secretive sexual activity.� 

�Oh,� I say. �I see.� I'm anxious for the conversation to end as quickly as possible.

�And if you must, Fifty, remember it's 'Mistress Ylena' and 'Mistress Josephine' just to be on the safe side.� Jo is smiling in a friendly way.

�I said it wasn't you, it was my husband.�

�OK, that's fine, Fifty.� I'm not sure if she believes me, or not. I'm not sure if I believe me, or not. �But, we still need to talk about this. In your application form, when you were asked if you were prepared to be involved in sexual contact with your fellow participants, you said 'possibly'. I just wanted to check whether your views had changed since you got here?�

�Changed?�

�Yes. Whether you had come to the conclusion that you definitely were prepared for such interactions, or whether you had decided that you weren't, or whether you still wanted to keep an open mind? We won't do anything that conflicts with your responses on the application form, you know that. But equally, we wouldn't want you to miss out on experiences, because of a decision that you made earlier that needs to be updated in the light of experience.�&nbsp; 

�I don't know, Mistress,� I say, biting my lip. That's certainly true. I'd forgotten about the application form. I filled it in so long ago, or so it seems now.&nbsp; I guess I owe it to the research to experience this, though.&nbsp; It's true that I have been fantasising about sex with the other participants and the staff - and Joe, of course. I haven't been with a woman since I married Joe, well since I broke up with Angela, but it's hard not to look at Ylena or Carrie or Charlotte without going weak at the knees. But, I want to do these things with Joe, I've always wanted to do these things with Joe. It's just that somehow I couldn't ask, or he wouldn't listen or, well, I don't really know. And, there's something about Gerry too, I could just imagine myself.....

�Fifty?� Jo interrupts my daydreaming. I jerk my attention back to her questions.

�Yes, Mistress?�

�Your mind seemed to have wandered off. I don't need an answer now, but I did want to give you the chance to reconsider your choice. All right?�

�Yes, Mistress.� I make my decision. I have to say 'yes' for the sake of the research, I tell myself, and for Joe and me. Maybe, if I work this out of my system we can find a way back? Or, maybe I can work out how to get us both to where we're both happy. �I've thought about it and I think you should change that answer to 'yes'. Definitely.�

�If you are sure, Fifty,� Jo says, caringly.

I nod. �Yes,� I say, �quite sure.�

�In which case, there needs to be a change of behaviour. No more masturbating!�

I'm surprised by this, but I know I have to accept what Jo says. �No Mistress.�

�Unless of course, you are specifically directed to by one of the staff. You will carry out any such sexual acts with the other slaves as you are directed. You will make your mouth, vagina and arse available, as required. You are the sexual property of your owners and you will behave as such. Do you understand?�

Jo says this so gently, smiling as she carefully enunciates the words. It sounds so reasonable and so natural. I am almost ashamed I held back when I made my original application. But, sexual property? Well, yes I, suppose that makes sense, a slave is property after all. My arse? I hadn't thought about that? I've never... Well no, never. Apart from when Ylena did that with the electrical probe. Oh! I hadn't even thought about that before.

�I said, did you understand, Fifty?�

�Yes. Yes, Mistress.�

Jo turns back to her computer. �All right, Fifty. I've updated your file on the system. The staff will be aware of the change in your profile.�&nbsp; 

�Thank you, Mistress Josephine,� I hear myself saying.

�That's all right, Fifty. We want to make sure that you get everything you can out of your stay with us. Now, what is planned for you today?� 

�I have to see Gerry, Mistress. He wants to check that I am shaving my head correctly. And then, there's domestic duties and... �

�All right, Fifty. Off you go.�

I make my way up to Gerry's room. He's not there when I arrive, so I sit myself down in the chair to wait. Minutes later, I hear his laughing voice in the corridor and jump up out of my seat. It would never do to be sitting down when he came in.

�Hey, honey!� He exclaims when he comes through the door. �If it ain't my white Diallo! I may have two of you ladies to shave, but you sure have the cutest scalp.�

I smile, pleased to be complimented.

�Here to have your daily smooth 'n shine?�

�Yes, Gerry,�&nbsp; I say.

�You getting used to it now??? That tan stuff working out?�

I nod. Gerry turns to his lap top. I know that the staff always check the files before they start a session, but this time I know what he's going to see. He doesn't say anything about that though, he just says, �Hop up on the chair honey. Let's get this done.�

I get back onto the chair.&nbsp;&nbsp; He swings me around and tips me back. He picks up his electric razor and there's a whirring sound behind me. There's hardly any stubble on my head, but Gerry insists I get the once over every day. Heaven knows how I'll explain it when I get home. �So, how are you settling in? Did you enjoy the garden party? Didn't you look cute with the straps across your scalp.� 

I hardly get the chance to answer. Gerry's chatter is as effective at keeping me quiet as the muzzle was. I'm barely paying attention.

�... and you've owned up to feeling just a bit sexy, I see.�

Now I'm paying attention.

�Well, that's pretty honest by my book. The way you move, you're every bit as sensual as Miss Ramatoulaye, believe me! So you should get the fun of it. Sex is the greatest game. You're not too bad looking, you know. For a whitey.� I feel him reach down and brush the ring in my right nipple. �You'll have a lot of fun, believe me.� He continues to stroke my ring gently. The teasing sensation convinces me that he is right. I give a quiet whimper.

He leaves the ring be and turns his attention to my head again. �Now, I ain't got no time to play with you - more's the pity &#8211; but, we'd better make sure your scalp doesn't dry out.� He's rubbing some moisturiser in &#8211; it feels as sexy as when he was playing with my nipple ring.

�They got you working out yet?�

At first I think this is some sexual innuendo, but then I realise he's talking about body building again. I nod my head. 

�I think that&#8217;s a really good idea. You'll be surprised how much you can achieve with just an hour or so a day. I'll have a word with Jo and talk about how you are getting on. When your muscles start to stand out, you&#8217;re going to look even better than you do now. And, they&#8217;ll help your stamina. Gonna need that now you've put yourself on the sexual carousel.�
 
I hadn't thought I was putting myself on any &#8217;carousel&#8217; - surely he is teasing me, anyway? But, maybe I&#8217;ve misjudged things again. Gerry tells me I can go. I have housekeeping to do.

I get as far as the corridor outside some of the staff offices. I see George's back as I pass the door of one. I've only just gone by his office when I hear him call me to a halt. �Fifty!�

I stop and turn back to his room. �Yes sir,� I respond, wondering how he knew I was there.

He gets up from his desk and walks over towards me. �I see that you've changed your status on sexual behaviours.� I see that he's got the RFID Tracker window open on the screen of his PC, explaining how he knew I was passing by.

He's not really asking a question, but I reply anyway. �Yes, Sir.� 

�Good,� he says. �You can help out with one of your colleagues. Follow me.� He sets off down the corridor. I have to scurry to keep up with him. He leads the way into a room where Carrie is standing waiting submissively with her hands behind her back and her head bowed.

�Right, Fifty-two,� George says to Carrie. �We'll try again now, but with Fifty here. Do you think you can do any better?�

�I'll try, Sir,� Carrie responds. She doesn't sound very convinced.

�Well, then,� says George, �you'd better start.� 

Carrie looks across at me shyly. �I'm sorry about this,� she says in an embarrassed tone. I'm puzzled by her words. She takes me by the hand and leads me to one wall. There's a ring set up above head height. Carrie points to it and lifts my arm. I understand that she wants me to reach up for the ring and I do as she indicates. She takes my wrists and fastens the clips on my wrist, cuffs together, so that they are linked to the ring. 

George is standing watching carefully. �Good,� he says, �go on.�

Carrie responds. �You know how difficult this is.�
 
�Of course. That's not important. The only important thing is that you do as you are told. You are owned. You are property. You do as you are told. In this, as in everything else.�

�But, I've never..�

�I know. That's why I'm asking you to do it. If it were easy, it wouldn't be worth doing. Would it?�

Carrie shakes her head disconsolately. I'm standing there feeling a little foolish. My hands are up over my head and my arms are aching already. I watch as Carrie walks across towards me. She's wearing the grey sweat top and short skirt that all the slaves that weren't dumb enough to get their clothing instructions wrong are required to wear. I take some comfort from the fact that her auburn curls were shaved the same day that my hair was taken off. She's still as bald as I am. As she gets to my side, she drops to her knees and turns to look at George.

He folds his arms. Waiting.

Carrie reaches out with one hand, stroking my ankle and I realise what it is that George has told her to do. As she runs her hand up my leg and on to the soft skin on the inside of my thigh, I wriggle a little. �Hey! What is this?� I call out redundantly.

Neither George nor Carrie show any signs of being interested in what I have to say.

Carrie uses her hands to part my thighs. Angela did something similar to me once. She tied my wrists to the head rail and kept me there for hours playing with me. Now Carrie's fingers are playing with my crotch. Running her hands across my belly, probing with her fingers between my moistening lips as I respond to her touch, aroused by the combination of her touch, my helplessness and George's dispassionate, appraising stare.

�Is she getting wet,� George asks without concern for my sensibilities.

�Yes, Sir,� Carrie replies. Her fingers probe deeper and bring a soft �Oh!� from me.

�Good,� says George. �You're doing better than this morning. Continue.�

I look down. Carrie is pushing my legs apart with her hands. She moves her head towards my crotch. I see only her smooth, hairless scalp but I feel her tongue beginning to probe at my sex. As she licks and probes with her tongue, I feel myself react, pushing my hips forward to press my crotch against her face arching my legs to lift myself up towards the ring that holds my wrists above my head.

George is looking on in approval as Carrie&#8217;s efforts bear fruit. I whimper as her tongue pushes deep inside me and then flicks back to skip across my clit. Carrie reaches up and grasps my buttocks, one in each hand, pulling me to her as you might press a peeled fig to your mouth. Each touch of Carries tongue, the prick of her finger nails against my buttocks, the heat of her head between my thighs, all serve to lift me towards an orgasm.

I'm standing on tiptoe now, my upper body writhing as Carrie busies herself between my legs.,&nbsp; My breathing is catching as the sensations well up from my crotch.&nbsp; 

George claps his hands. �Enough!� he calls and immediately Carrie backs away from me. I give an involuntary cry, desperate at being so close to coming and yet deprived of the touch that was driving me. �And you, keep quiet, Fifty.�

Carrie gets to her feet, a quiet smile on her face. I can tell she knows that has done what was required of her - although I have my own concerns!

�Well done, Fifty-Two,� says George. �That was a much better effort. It wasn't so bad was it?�

Carrie, clasps her hands together in front of her. She looks across shyly towards me. �No,� she says. �Not at all.�

�All right,� says George. �You'd better get on. We should have got this far in your earlier session, so don't waste time now.� Carrie nods and leaves while George turns to me. He reaches up and frees my wrists from the ring. As he does so, my knees buckle and I slide down the wall to the floor, still panting slightly from being so close to orgasm. He looks down at me. �And, you'd better bring yourself off, I suppose. You won't be any use to anyone until you do.� He sees me hesitate. �Do it,� he orders. �Your sexual activity is our property, so do as you are told!�

And so, grateful for his permission, embarrassed by my response to Carrie's attentions and humiliated to be masturbating as he watches, I set to work with my own fingers to bring myself release.

George watches with interested amusement until I&#8217;ve finished. I know I like to be the centre of attention sometimes, but I don&#8217;t enjoy the way he seems to be watching every move, grinning as the waves of orgasms crash over me and leave me catching my breath, propped against the wall of the room.&nbsp; �OK,� he says. �That&#8217;s enough fun for now. You&#8217;d better get on with � What are you supposed to be doing, Fifty?�

�Domestic duties, Sir,� I pant. �I should be in the kitchens.�

�Well, if you&#8217;re fixing some food you&#8217;d better get down there. Make sure you wash those fingers though. They look a bit sticky to me.�

I&#8217;m shocked by this and humiliated. Somehow, everything builds up inside me, all of the tensions and extraordinary experiences of the last few days boil over. I burst into tears, sobbing at his callous indifference to my embarrassment. �You can&#8217;t say that! You just can&#8217;t! It&#8217;s disgusting. It&#8217;s just� just � not � not .. fair!�

�Fifty,� George is crouching down beside me, lifting my chin up with his hand, looking straight into my eyes and speaking quietly and firmly. �I can say that. I know you&#8217;re just starting with this, but you&#8217;ll listen to it and you&#8217;ll learn to take it. If you think that a few crude remarks is the worst that can happen to you here, you&#8217;re going to be disappointed. You know that don&#8217;t you? All right?�

I&#8217;m still upset, but inside I know that he&#8217;s right. I&#8217;ve put myself here after all. I do what I can to pull&nbsp; myself together. Of course, he&#8217;s right. I nod. �Yes, Sir. Sorry, Sir.� I say.

�Very well. Now, off you go.�

Work in the kitchen takes up an hour, or so, and then there&#8217;s cleaning and laundry to do. We&#8217;re all kept pretty busy and there&#8217;s not much chance to talk to one another as we scurry around at our various tasks. 

It was as we were finishing our evening meal that Jo came across to our table. �Fifty, Fifty-two,� Carrie and I looked up. �For Useful Time this evening, you&#8217;ll both report to George, please.�

Useful Time! We&#8217;ve spent all day working. I&#8217;d been hoping we might have the evening off, but it seems like it isn&#8217;t to be.&nbsp; 

Carrie and I get to out feet, exchanging glances that share our concern about what awaits us. Jo tells us to turn around and put our hands behind our backs. She fastens my wrist cuffs together and goes to do the same for Carrie. As she grips her wrists, Carrie tries to struggle free, yelling, �No, please, I&#8217;ve had enough.� She almost breaks away from Jo. I&#8217;m astonished, it&#8217;s the first time that I&#8217;ve seen anyone do anything other than accept the treatment handed out to them. It never occurred to me that I could do otherwise.

Jo spins Carrie around. �Be quiet Fifty-two!� she is very firm.

�No!� Carrie calls, defiantly, �No! It&#8217;s too much, I can&#8217;t cope. I can&#8217;t! I can&#8217;t�

I watch as Jo nods to Celia, who&#8217;s sitting at the other end of the room. Carrie is becoming hysterical. Jo grabs her by the arms as she goes on calling, �No!� Jo puts her hand to either side of Carrie&#8217;s head holding it tightly. �Hush,� she says, insistently, �hush!�

I see Celia come up behind her, she pulls a bit gag across Carrie&#8217;s mouth and buckles it tightly. It only upsets Carrie further, inevitably. She&#8217;s shaking her head to try to dislodge the gag without any success. 

Celia grabs me and pulls me away. Jo puts her arms around Carrie and pulls her close. �Shh,� she says calmly. �It&#8217;s all right. Don&#8217;t worry. Relax. Take a breath. Sometimes, it gets too much. We know. Just relax. It&#8217;s all right. We&#8217;ll take care of you.� Her voice has an almost hypnotic quality. I can see Carrie calming. Jo is holding her close, stroking her neck and scalp and saying, �There. There. It&#8217;s all right.�

�Gnngh,� Carrie whimpers quietly over the rubber bar across her mouth. �Hhngh.� I can see the tenseness, flowing from her as Jo&#8217;s calming manner takes effect.

�Come, now,� Jo says firmly. �It&#8217;s all right, but you must come now.� Celia hands Jo a pair of leashes. Jo clips one to Carrie&#8217;s collar and one to mine. �Come now. Come,� she says to Carrie pulling gently on her leash. She tightens the slack on mine. We both follow her.

�Hhng,� Carrie whimpers again as Jo leads us from the dining room. Carrie and I exchange glances. Her eyes are filled with tears, but whether they are in regret at her current circumstance, her rebellion or her submission, I cannot tell.

We follow Jo along the corridor. She&#8217;s not taking us to George&#8217;s office, but to the accommodation block. I&#8217;ve been up here a few times on domestic duties. Each of the staff has one of the&nbsp; small suites; a bedroom, bathroom, sitting room cum study. Inward Bound must use them for the people on their management training courses. She takes us into George&#8217;s. It&#8217;s the same as any of the others I&#8217;ve been to. Maybe not quite as tidy. Perhaps, that&#8217;s what we&#8217;re here for; as far as I can tell �Useful Time� mostly means �Slaving For The Faculty Time.�

Jo has a few quiet words with George as we wait by the door, but then she leaves. I can see Carrie is distressed by Jo&#8217;s departure, but she still doesn&#8217;t say anything. George sits on his couch, looking up at us. He&#8217;s obviously considering what to do in the light of Carrie&#8217;s concern. He beckons to her and signals for her to kneel beside him.

�Are you all right now, Fifty-two?� he asks. �You know we want you to be happy here, don&#8217;t you?�

�Hhng,� Carrie nods. From the way she looks at George, I can tell she is happier now and I suddenly realise it isn&#8217;t that she was told she was coming here that was the trouble. It was that she was coming here with me. 

�Well,� George goes on, �you have to know that you must do as you are told. And, you know that you have to stretch yourself, don&#8217;t you? Are you ready to stretch yourself for me?�

�Hngh,� Carrie nods again; slowly this time. 

�Good,� says George. Suddenly, I&#8217;m thinking, hey, does this &#8216;stretching&#8217; involve me? And, if so, why isn&#8217;t anyone asking me how I feel about it. Then George gets up and starts to lead Carrie towards his bedroom. Her eyes have widened considerably. �Wait there,� he says to me.

Surely, I&#8217;m not expected to stand here and listen while he has his way with her. Anyway, I didn&#8217;t think that the staff were supposed to have sexual contact with the slaves. But, it&#8217;s only a few minutes before he comes back out of the bedroom. 

�Now you, Fifty,� he says taking hold of my leash. He takes me in the same direction as Carrie. When we get into the room I see that she has been laid out on George&#8217;s bed. She is still gagged, her wrists are fastened to the bed&#8217;s head rail. George turns to me. �You had the benefit of this young lady's attentions earlier,� he says. �Now it&#8217;s your chance to return the favour.� 

I&#8217;m not sure that I want this privilege, but equally, I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m being given the choice. George leads me to the foot of the bed and has me kneel there. He sits down on the bed beside Carrie. She has clamped her legs firmly together from thigh to ankle. George shakes his head, putting one hand on her knee and sliding it upwards towards the hem of her skirt. Carrie grunts through her gag angered by his attentions.&nbsp; �Come on, Fifty-two, open up, or I'll strap your ankles to a spreader bar,� he says, ignoring her protests and pushing her thighs apart. �You should enjoy it anyway, you'll be getting the attentions of an expert cunnilinguist. She spent a lot of time pleasuring her Mistress before she came here. So, if you're going to have a woman go down on you for the first time, you couldn't get a better.�

As he says that, I'm puzzled for a moment and then I think back to the application form I filled in when I first approached Inward Bound. Maybe, I'd gone a bit over the top describing the extent of my relationship with Angela. I mean, yes it was a dom-sub relationship, with me in the sub role, but it wasn't very physical, if you know what I mean. Angela was more into mental domination than anything physical, really and there hadn't been much sexual contact between us. She'd just be happy to have me sit at her feet, while she read a book and played with my hair. Sometimes, she let me massage her feet.&nbsp; But, if I tried to stroke her while sitting at her feet, she'd tap my hand away, saying �bad slave!�. The first time we went to a munch, she was so quiet that everyone thought I was the top. It was only when she told me not to be so excitable and called me back to her side like some naughty child that the others there realised what the relationship actually was. I did say on my form that I had a lot of experience of oral sex. Thinking about it, that was probably an exaggeration. And, that my Mistress had forced me to pleasure her with my wrists chained,. that was certainly an exaggeration. I mean, she did tie me up a few times and once we went to a fetish fair with one of my wrists chained to a ring on her belt. I'd loved it, following her around like a puppy, but she kept forgetting I was attached to her and she'd wander off without warning. 

I guess it would be misleading to call it a BDSM relationship, really. In some ways it was almost platonic. Really just a Domme and a sub in a relationship together, more than anything heavier. Certainly there was nothing like the sort of BDSM involvement that I could imagine now.

But don't think it was any the less a relationship based on dominance and submission for that. Angela very much wanted to have me under her control. It's just that apart from once or twice, it didn't involve much in the way of bondage or beatings, or even sex.

Anyway, now I'm going to have to demonstrate that I am at least competent with my tongue. I can just imagine the consequences for being caught out having lied on my form.

Carrie parts her thighs with a compliant whimper., George takes my leash and pulls me forward, guiding my head between them. In spite of Carrie's protests, she's evidently excited by the situation; her lips are warm and moist and musky smelling. I press my lips against hers, kissing and sucking focussing on doing to her what in my fantasies I would love to have done to me. Only, Joe never does. Maybe he would, if I asked him? Carrie responds with enthusiasm, pushing back as she braces herself against the head rail; her reaction drives my own.

�Very good,� I hear George say. �You two certainly know how to have fun.�

I run my tongue along each of her lips in turn. Carrie feels my tongue stud, hard against her labia. That brings an excited reaction. I respond by running my tongue up towards her clit. Carrie's gagged grunts get louder. 

As my stud flicks across her clit, she pushes her hips forward pressing her crotch against my face. I'm delighted to be getting such a reaction. My pleasure drives hers. Carrie squeezes her thighs together trapping my head, stopping me from lifting away from her.&nbsp; Carrie lifts her feet and plants them on my shoulders, she's tugging at the chains that hold her to the bed head and moaning louder as my tongue slides back and forth. I am hardly able to catch my breath with my face jammed up hard against her crotch, unable to move with the weight of her feet on my back and my wrists fixed together. Carrie bucks again thrusting forward with her hips and I give a muffled �oomph!� in return. Carrie's close to orgasm now, when all of a sudden her legs are prised apart and George drags me away. �That will do for now,� he says.

�Uhhhh!� I mutter as I reluctantly climb off the bed, panting and desperately aroused. Carrie's yelping in her gag, pressing her thighs together as she tries to bring herself to climax. George firmly moves her legs apart and cuffs her ankles to the bed rail so that she cannot close her thighs. She's yelping in frustration at the source of her pleasure being removed.

Slowly her gasping eases, her moans quieten and she becomes silent, her violent thrashing around calms and she is laying still. George sits down beside her on the bed and unfastens her gag. The first thing she says, as the rubber bar swings clear of her mouth, is, �Thank you, Sir.� And I'm thinking hey, how about some thanks this way, too!

�You see,� George says to her. �You can trust me to stretch you, Fifty-two and I think you've still got a lot further to go.�

I want to say that it was a stretch for me, too, but that would mean I'd have to admit I'd been less than honest on my form! Maybe I should have been more honest. Maybe I should have been more honest with Angela about what I wanted. Maybe I need to be more honest with Joe, too.

George unfastens Carrie from the bed and we are both led back to our cells; Carrie with a far away look in her eye, almost bumping into the walls as, we follow George along the corridors. Myself, with an aching absence in my crotch and face that feels bright pink, as though it's been locked in a vice.

I'm put back in my cell and the bars close and the shutters come down. The lights go out. I'm so aroused by the evening's events that my hands slide towards my crotch under the blanket. Then, I open my eyes and I'm looking at the little red light blinking in the ceiling of my cell. I'm not going to do that with them watching, even though I am burning with frustration. Sleep? It&#8217;s a long time coming�

Chapter 20: The Problem With Research

Course 8 / Day 27: Course Progress Meeting

Participant Notes: Fifty

Jo: I conducted an informal progress review with Fifty this pm. I'm pleased overall with her progress. After worries early on as to how well she would respond to obedience training (given her initial presentation when she started the course), I consider that those issues need no longer give concern. Fifty appears comfortable (or at least acquiesces) with the regime and her expectations from the course seem to be being met. HOWEVER: I wish to raise the question of her motivation for joining the course, which may not have been entirely recreational. See attached transcript from an extract of the review meeting.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 


Jenny's Recollections:

It's Usefulness Time, the day's training sessions are completed. Earlier, Jo decided that she would practice some of the lessons she learned about shibari from Ylena. My arms still carry the pressure marks from the rope. Ylena stopped by as Jo was finishing and nodded her approval. �Soon I think you will wear the colours of the Russian flag for me, slooga,� she says to me.

Now I am kneeling beside Mistress Jo's chair holding a tray with jug of water and a glass.

�How was your training today, Fifty?� Jo asks.

�I did my best, Mistress,� I respond, trying, and not quite succeeding, to suppress a smile, because things did not go too well; I have quite a lot to learn about which plants in the flower beds are actually weeds and which are not.&nbsp; Jo must have heard about this faux pas, because she narrows one eye slightly as she takes the glass from the tray and sips from it before returning it to its position. Flippant comments are clearly out of place tonight

�I wanted to talk with you about how you feel you are progressing; how you feel about your stay here.�

�I'm very happy, Mistress,� I reply.

�You can call me Jo, for now.�

�I'm very happy &#8211; Jo &#8211; really I am.� It is beginning to feel quite strange to use someone's proper name.&nbsp; A bit like being back at school and being asked by one of the teachers to call them by their first name. I am almost more used to being called&nbsp; �Fifty� or �slave�&nbsp; than I am to being Jenny. Funny &#8211; how strange that sounds ......

�In your application you said that you wanted to 'find out if this type of sexual trip is as exciting in reality as it is in my head'. Is that working out for you?�

I nod. �Yes, Jo,� I say. �More than I expected. Some of it is hard. Well, a lot of it, really. Even my fantasies hadn't got into some of the things that I have been doing here and...� I notice that Jo is peering at me from beneath arched eyebrows and realise that I have let my self sit back on my haunches. She grins as she sees that I have recognised my mistake and kneel up again.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

�This doesn't come easy to you, does it?�

�No, Jo. In my real life, I'm very used to thinking for myself. I have to be very independent and self sufficient.�

�That's not something we encourage here. You will have had quite a culture shock. Here you have to try to think what is that we want of you.�

�I know. Well, the, er, how should I put it? The change of lifestyle? That&#8217;s what I wanted to explore..� 

�So remind me what you did, what you do? In real life?�

�In real life? It&#8217;s funny: in many ways what I am doing now seems more like real life. Officially, I&#8217;m described as a Research Student. I work in a university. My post has me lecturing, giving tutorials to the students and researching. And, being run ragged. The popular idea of university life is people drifting along rivers in punts past wonderful medieval colleges and occasionally doing a bit of work. In fact, it often feels more like being a slave chasing all these different goals. Priorities always shifting. Everything needed at once. And, I&#8217;m married and with my husband away quite a bit, that can be difficult, too. So, being here with one thing to do at once and being told exactly what to do &#8211; is really wonderful, for a change at least!

�Well, that&#8217;s definitely not the reply I was expecting! So what&#8217;s your research area?� 

�You'd find it interesting,� I say. I'm always pleased to talk about my work. Most of the time people just glaze over and while I've been here the only intellectual stimulus has been trying to keep track of everything for the paper I'm going to write when I get back. 

Pleased to be asked about my work, I spill out more than I should say, really. �It's psychology. Mainly looking at people's reactions under stress. How increased stress affects judgement; whether the complexity of the stresses alters&nbsp; their combined impact on the individual; whether interpersonal relationships add to or reduce stress; what the impact of stress on sexual desire is; how much the environment contributes to psychological stress; that sort of thing.�

�Well, you'll see plenty of that here. This would be an ideal laboratory for that sort of �investigation.� Jo is looking at me with a quizzical expression.

Blast! What have I said?&nbsp; It's best practice in psychological research to be discreet with your subjects about the questions you are really interested in. It's supposed to help them give honest answers. The Inward Bound people are my �sample� and I have let the cat out of the bag. Blast! Blast!&nbsp; I try to recover the situation:

�No, No. This is very different. Nothing like everyday life. You couldn't compare this with people's normal stresses. Even if you thought that there were similarities.� Oh no, that's even worse. It sounds like I've been thinking about it. She looks like she doesn't believe a word I'm saying. I'm not sure what to do next. Perhaps diversionary tactics; �Would you like some more water, Mistress?� It&#8217;s feeble, but it&#8217;s the best I can do.

�No, thank you, Fifty,� she says. I notice she doesn't ask me to call her 'Jo' again and she brings the discussion to a rather abrupt close. �We always ask at these review sessions, if you wish to end your participation, but I'm guessing that you don't?� 

I shake my head.

�Good. Well that will do for now. This is still your Usefulness Time, isn't it?�

�Yes, Mistress,� I say. 

�Well go, and tidy my room, Fifty. And, when you've finished return to your cell for lock in.�

�Yes, Mistress,� I say again getting to my feet and bowing my head as I have been taught.&nbsp; 

It doesn't take long to tidy Jo's room, but I know that I have to have everything placed perfectly. She treats me fairly, but she won't overlook any mistakes and I don't want the demerits. With luck, she'll forget about our conversation. I hope. 

As I put the last of Jo&#8217;s things away in her room, George appears. �Have you finished, Fifty?� he asks.

�Yes, Sir,� I say respectfully. George seems preoccupied. 

�Hmm. Good. Well I have a further task for you. Come with me.�

I follow him down to a small room. He opens the door. Inside, Judy is standing, waiting.

�Here, you are, Nineteen,� he announces to Judy. �Here is the treat I promised you.�

Judy smiles, evidently in anticipation.

�Can I have her with her wrists cuffed behind her, please Sir?� Judy asks. I&#8217;m disconcerted. I&#8217;m used to being discussed this way by the staff at Inward Bound, but not by the other slaves.

�Of course,� says George, gripping my wrists gently, but firmly and fastening my cuffs together. I don&#8217;t struggle, naturally, but I do give him a puzzled look. �You&#8217;ve already shown your skills, Fifty,� he says. �Nineteen here has earned a treat. You are to serve her for an hour, or so. Do just as she says. As if I, or one of the other staff, were telling you to. Do you understand?�

�Yes, Sir, but�� I begin.

�No, Fifty, no buts. Do as Nineteen orders. I&#8217;ll return to collect you in due course.�

As he is about to leave, Judy lays back on the couch that stretches along one wall of the room. �Come here, slave,� she says, beckoning me.

I really don&#8217;t feel that this is right. She is a slave, just like me. She shouldn&#8217;t be giving me orders.

�Come here,� she says, more insistently, �come here and kneel.�

�Do as you are told, Fifty,� George says. He watches as I reluctantly approach the couch and kneel beside it. He nods with approval, as I stay still allowing Judy to play gently with my nipple rings. �Good,� he says, �keep that up.� And he leaves the two of us.

�What&#8217;s going on?� I say as soon as he has gone.

�Silence, slave,� Judy orders, placing a finger on my lips to reinforce her point. She is evidently enjoying her newly given powers. �You heard what was said. You are my reward. You are to serve me. I asked for you especially.� After they way that she groped me the first time that I was take to see Ylena, I suppose I shouldn&#8217;t be surprised. �Now, use your mouth on my feet. Kiss them!�

She waves me away towards the end of the couch with a gesture of disdain. It seems very unfair, but I suppose that I must do as I am told and besides with my wrists cuffed behind me, I don&#8217;t feel that I have much choice. I set to work following Judy&#8217;s orders kissing her feet and ankles, licking with my tongue between her toes. Judy certainly seems to find it arousing and her arousal contributes to mine. She leans forward to hold me by the back of the neck and guides my head up her calves, to her knees and the inside of her thighs, all the time insisting that I continue to kiss her. legs. ,

Finally, she draws my head between her legs. �Use your tongue, slave,� she commands. �Use your tongue.� I do as she tells me, aroused by her smell and taste and my sense of powerlessness -&nbsp; captive and obedient, the slave of a slave. Judy grips my head tightly between her thighs as my tongue licks and probes at her sex, her responses telling me that my every move is having its effect. Each time my tongue slips across the moist folds of flesh her hips press upwards, pushing back into my face. With her thighs pressing together I find it harder to catch my breath but I can&#8217;t do other than go on. As her excitement builds, my own mounts. As her hip thrusts grow in intensity the flicks of my tongue become more fevered. What else should a slave be doing?&nbsp;&nbsp; 

Delighted by my efforts, Judy decides to return the compliment. Ordering me onto my back on the couch and laying alongside me, she starts to fondle my breasts with one hand, while the other buries itself between my thighs. With my wrists cuffed, I can&#8217;t prevent her doing as she will and she is obviously delighting in teasing me. She traces a finger nail around my right nipple, not touching any other part of me for a while. She takes her hand away. She starts to kiss my neck again not touching me anywhere else. My eyes are shut. I&#8217;m not really sure about time any more. All I know is the feel of her touch on my body and now her fingers are burrowing between my thighs, parting my cunt and slipping over my clit. Every move drives my arousal up so that when she moves her hands away, I quake as much when she ceases her touching as I do when she starts.

As I almost reach orgasm, she interrupts me again to move my tongue down to her sex, giggling at my groan of frustration, and then giving a mewing cry as my actions push her over the edge.

It is, as she lays back, panting, that George returns.

�You seem to have enjoyed your treat, Nineteen,� he says. 

Judy laying back on the couch with a dreamy look on her face gives a simple, �Mmmm.� 

�Well, I&#8217;m sorry to have to bring play time to an end,� he says as he unfastens my wrist cuffs, �but it&#8217;s time for you to go back to your cells &#8211; in a way. Come with me, both of you.� 

We are both taken back to Judy&#8217;s cell.

�Right Nineteen: lay down please, legs apart,� George instructs.

Judy complies but with a quizzical frown forming on her face.

�And you Fifty: climb on top of Nineteen facing the other way.�

I kneel over Judy, looking down at her crotch as she lays beneath me looking up at mine. George connects my wrists to Judy&#8217;s ankles and Judy&#8217;s wrists to my ankles, using short leather straps run between the rings on our wrist and ankle cuffs. He smiles. �As a special treat, you two may now have as many orgasms and you wish &#8211; but you will have to work carefully together!�

The straps are quite short. Long enough for mouths to connect to pussies but not long enough to permit much freedom of movement. 

It&#8217;s clear that this development is not entirely welcome to Judy! She obviously doesn&#8217;t welcome this return to being as much of a slave as I am. I can almost sense that she is scowling at George but she doesn&#8217;t say anything. 

�We shall be watching you both and expect to see you both work hard for each other: clear Nineteen?�

�Yes, � Sir,� Judy replies to George a little reluctantly. The pause between the �yes� and the Sir� tells me that she still has the sulky look on her face.

�Off you go then!�

George stays until I begin to feel Judy&#8217;s tongue on my lips and of course I repay the compliment to Judy.&nbsp; Satisfied we are both working as directed George leaves, locking the cell behind him, closing the shutter and switching off the light.

We both know that if we pause there will be demerits and canings. We have to go on as we were told. It feels like it&#8217;s going to be a long night �

We keep at one another for what seems like several hours, both enjoying several orgasms. As we are in one another&#8217;s hands, so to speak, we each push the other along much harder than we might in normal circumstances (whatever that might be).

Suddenly the lights go up and Charlotte pads into our cell:

�I&#8217;m sorry to ruin your nights entertainment both of you , but Fifty has another engagement, and Nineteen &#8211; you look as if you can use some sleep at last�

We stop. I&#8217;m disappointed but perhaps relieved that our exertions are over &#8211; but what&#8217;s this about another engagement for me?

Charlotte undoes the straps and I climb down a little awkwardly from Judy&#8217;s bed. Judy smiles back at me in a predatory way, as if to say �and I&#8217;m not half finished with you.� I hope she&#8217;s not given the chance.

Charlotte clips a lead to my collar, locks Judy in again and guides me back to my own cell.
By my bed stands a large wedge of foam, shaped to fit someone who might lay over it. It&#8217;s covered with some sort of black cloth but has anchoring rings at each corner.

First Charlotte coats a gold coloured very phallic looking dildo with a lubricating jelly and silently hands it to me. There&#8217;s no doubt about what I&#8217;m expected to do with it. Thanks to Judy&#8217;s past efforts, it slides right inside me oh so easily, leaving me feeling pleasantly filled.

Charlotte motions me to lay down on my front. 

I am left with my legs spread and my bum up in the air, very exposed.

More straps! She gently but firmly secures me. I feel her lubricating my bud. She probes me with a gloved finger. I open. She replaces the finger with something which feels just like the anal electrode Ylena used on me.

�Fifty: lift yourself,� she orders.

I obey.

She passes a rubber strap around my waist and another over my pussy and my bud. Both straps get tightened. There is no hope of expelling either of the intruders filling me. She peels off her gloves and starts to connect wires to the butt plug and the dildo. Then she crouches beside me;
�You will enjoy this, Fifty. These plugs are connected to the power unit &#8211; the one Ylena used on you. The power unit is controlled by this laptop &#8211; see? Here?�

�Yes Mistress,� I reply nervously.

�Ummm. Well, let&#8217;s just say its going to hold your attention for the rest of the night. Oh and there&#8217;s a surprise feature you will find out about soon. Night night!�

With that, Charlotte plants a kiss on my shoulder leaves, locking me alone in my cell to await developments. I do not have to wait long. Current begins to flow through me, across my already sexually excited tissues.

First the dildo tickling, peppery, stinging.

Then the butt plug throbbing, pulsing.

Then the two of them together.

Then one at a time.

Slowly building. Slowly fading. Building quickly. Fading slowly.

I cannot help myself: I begin to moan: first softly then louder. I try to pull away from the wedge, but I am held fast. And then both intruders pulse, throb and sting together: I cry out in surprise. They repeat stronger. I cry louder. They reply stronger still! That&#8217;s the surprise! They must in part be triggered by the noises I am making and the laptop&#8217;s programme has been written to make sure I make as much noise as possible! I try my hardest to breath quietly through the sensory barrage. Gradually, excruciatingly slowly I manage to bring the situation under control. The stimulation begins to decay �.. Sleep begins steel into my brain � I relax � then both intruders burst into life once more. I gasp. The microphone hears me and feeds more power through me. I moan, cry gasp and cry again. The system responds implacably. I am now riding a wild horse! Tossing on rough sea!&nbsp; With the greatest of efforts I regain control. Sleep is once more casting its cloak over me when the anal electrode starts to pulse and my sphincter responds: I feel I am obscenely fucking myself with the electric butt plug as the dildo starts again to tease and tickle. I cry out again against the exquisite torment of fatigue and frustration &#8211; and I instantly begin to pay the price for my insolence! The night wears on but oh so slowly ��.

Chapter 21: Private Investigations

Corinne and Jo are watching Jenny&#8217;s sexual torment on the monitor fed by the camera in her cell. �What do you think we should do, Corrine?� Jo says. �Do you think she is actually researching us? It could equally be some sort of put up job by some of the tabloid press.�

 �Hmmm, well Fifty will not be the last person to try to capitalise on her experiences, I&#8217;m sure,� Corinne responds. �On the other hand again, if she has organised her visit was solely as part of a research project and did not tell us &#8211; that&#8217;s a bit rude to say the least.�

Jo points to the monitor. It is obvious that the electrical impulses and the feedback from the laptop&#8217;s microphone are having the expected effect. �Well, whatever she is up to, I think this little piece of erotic punishment is richly deserved.�

Corinne smiles slowly, �You&#8217;re right. I think we should keep the situation under review and see what happens.�

Gerry appears and joins in �What are we doing with Fifty now?�

�George served her up to Nineteen as a treat and then switched things around so that Nineteen was having to both give and take. After that we&#8217;ve put Fifty on a feed-back routine.�

�Nineteen? Oh yes, she&#8217;d been getting a bit full of herself. That will have helped.� Gerry looks at the monitor. �And now Miss Fifty seems to have something to take her mind off whatever else she might have been up to.�

While Jenny is paying for her careless remarks well into the early morning, Professor Angela Dawney has also makes an early start to the day and, back in the university, she is sitting at her desk.

She is working on a research grant application for a longitudinal project into the differences in play behaviours in young and mature adults. One of the down sides of the academic world is that it seems that the process of gaining the funding for research consumes almost as much effort as the research itself. One of the other downsides is trying to find quality time to do it.

She brews herself a strong&nbsp; black coffee and savours the warm, strong, black, liquid. Taking a few moments out from important business, she finds her mind wandering to one of her post graduate students. The Prof smiles as she thinks about Jenny McEwan; reflecting on how she managed to get Jenny herself to come up with&nbsp; the idea of going on a two month consensual slavery course as part of the research for her PhD thesis. 

What a brilliant idea!&nbsp; Useful for Jenny&#8217;s project; well perhaps. Useful to get Jenny back into the arms of Angela; almost certainly. Angela ponders how, with any luck, this exercise will drive a wedge between Jenny and her husband, Joe. When Jenny broke up with Angela, she gave the impression that he wasn&#8217;t comfortable with BDSM play. Since Angela happens to know that Jenny is rather keen on BDSM play, it seems unlikely she&#8217;ll be happy to go back to good old vanilla Joe after this episode. Angela smiles, wondering how pliable Jenny will be when she gets back. According to Angela&#8217;s analysis, Jenny should be anxious to prolong the sensations and experiences that she has undergone at Inward Bound and she should be more than willing to follow advice on the best way to do that. Angela&#8217;s advice, Angela&#8217;s carefully considered advice. Which will be that, by and large, Jenny should go on doing just as she is told. 

Angela&#8217;s mind begins to drift to what Jenny might have had to endure on her course. Spankings? Canings? Bondage? Nudity? Mmmmmm. �

Suddenly her reverie is broken by the &#8216;phone. She jerks back irritably into the real world, almost spilling her coffee. She has come into the office early precisely to avoid interruptions!

�Professor Dawney speaking.�

�Oh, hullo Angela, it&#8217;s Roy. I thought I saw you in the building and I&#8217;m glad I caught you.� It was fairly unusual for the Dean of Faculty to call. Mostly he preferred to drop by. It probably meant this was something urgent, and that, in Angela&#8217;s experience was rarely good news.

�Yes, Roy. What can I do for you?�

�Well, I have been in a meeting yesterday with the other Deans and the Vice-Chancellor about the Research Assessment Exercise.� Angela&#8217;s spirits dropped at the mention of the RAE process. �We&#8217;ve now had a date from the Department of Education for their visitation.&nbsp; Ministry Aparatchiks in the guise of colleagues from other institutions and their repulsive hangers on, as we all know, but a necessary evil of course. You will not be surprised to learn just how important the Vice Chancellor regards our preparations? Arnold is particularly keen that we put up a good show�

�No, of course not.� Angela is hardly surprised, quite apart from Arnold&#8217;s need to maintain the academic reputation of the University and the funding that brings with it., The Vice Chancellor has his eye on the next steps up the rungs of life&#8217;s ladder and a consistently high score in the RAE always helps.

�Well, at the risk of being tedious, I have been asked to take the message back to all the Professorial Heads. The University is determined to maintain its last grading and intends to increase its Star Rating this time.� Angela rolled her eyes: star ratings, gradings, assessments, approvals, why couldn&#8217;t they let them get on with the research and let the results speak for themselves? �There is nothing more important in the forthcoming year. All other considerations are secondary. You will do all in your power to see to it that all post grads get their degrees and write theses to the highest standard. We will expect you to take every opportunity to have work published: papers, lectures at conferences, poster demonstrations at meetings, you know the sort of thing.�

�Yes, Roy. Of course.� Angela feels exasperation rising, what does he think the department spends its time doing, anyway? 

�Erm, well now we know the dates for the assessment, we can all plan accordingly. Anyway, Arnold is also intending to meet with professors personally. Ginger things along, you know the sort of thing.� Angela knows well enough. A complete waste of time in her view. �Oh, and you should expect the Research Assessment Team to take a close interest in the thoroughness of PhD supervision. And, they&#8217;ll be taking particular interest in Research Ethics.&nbsp; So, for goodness sake, make sure that any of your students who might need Ethics Committee approval have got it before they do any experimental or field work.

Angela manages to produce a confident chuckle as she replies, �Yes, of course Roy. I will look forward to seeing Arnold. When does he to want to see me?�

�No idea at the moment. This is just a distant early warning, as it were. I&#8217;m speaking to everyone as soon as I can.&nbsp; Just so we can all have our house in order, get all the ducks in a row. You know.�

Angela does now. �Thanks Roy. Leave it with me,� she says.
 
�Good. Good. So please, can you make a preliminary sketch, so to speak, of what your final submission will look like? At your earliest?

�Yes, Roy. Of course. Just leave it with me.�

Roy rings off and as she puts the phone down Angela&#8217;s mood has darkened. Considerably. She&#8217;s thinking again about Jenny and a worm of doubt starts to wiggle in Angela&#8217;s brain. Angela hadn&#8217;t actually got quite as far as gaining Ethics Committee approval for Jenny&#8217;s jaunt. Without any doubt it should have been. This was after all research with human subjects (Jenny) and research involving a student as subject (Jenny) Damn! Damn! What to do?

Since Jenny broke with Angela, their relationship had been &#8211; strained. And, Angela&#8217;s eye had not been quite on the ball. She&#8217;d certainly slipped up with that.

Then again, how was her research actually going? And, was it really research at all at this stage? Thinking about it really, what Jenny is doing doesn&#8217;t really qualify as proper research, yet. It&#8217;s more a sort of experiential immersion, getting to grips with the subject matter rather than research per se.

Angela could always claim that she&#8217;d considered ethics approval would only be needed when they moved to a more detailed exploration of the subject.

What is needed is something that made this look sufficiently interesting to justify the work done so far, but sufficiently tentative as to leave aside the question of why she hadn&#8217;t gone for ethics approval. Was there anything which she could put in her Research Assessment Exercise submission which was worth writing and which Jenny would also put her name to? The RAE is a pain but the University takes it seriously. There has to be a way to get something into that. What else? What about an early publication?&nbsp; 

Angela shook her head. It was far too soon for a paper and that made it look like the whole thing was further on than she wanted it to appear, but what about something for the next British Association meeting? Some sort of short presentation maybe. Perhaps a flyer for the attendees outlining the areas that she is working on? That might be a possibility �

So, thinks Angela, what are we going to do?&nbsp; The first challenge is to get the little bitch back at her desk here and start to prepare the poster, that&#8217;s what! Her Inward Bound expedition was supposed to be a pilot project anyway. No, more like an exploratory observational exercise. Something to see if this was a line of research which could be followed. Now that sounds better, there wouldn&#8217;t be any issue over her judgment that the Ethics Committee would not be interested in it at this rudimentary stage. Rudimentary. Yes! That&#8217;s the right word. Rudimentary. Provisional. Yes� That&#8217;s more like it! Angela starts to feel more comfortable.

But, what to do in practice? How to get her back? And, not to raise Jenny&#8217;s suspicions?

Angela slowly assesses the problem. The line of attack seemed to be sound enough, but the issue is what to do next? How to find some reason for Inward Bound to end the sessions and send her back. But, thinks Angela, they&#8217;ll be happy just as long as they get their money.

Of course, Angela realises, money is the answer! Inward Bound is being paid from Angela&#8217;s endowment fund. What about a convenient cash flow problem? Inward Bound is a commercial outfit, after all. If the money dries up, they&#8217;ll want to terminate Jenny&#8217;s little adventure. Pity it could not have run a little longer, thinks Angela, regretfully. Still, this is now a survival exercise. Angela&#8217;s survival. She considers one final time. She decides. Finally.

Angela opens �Contacts� on her cell phone and dials the Inward Bound number. Corrine answers the phone.

At the end of the conversation Angela feels much happier, but Corinne doesn&#8217;t.

�Larry, can I have a word?� Corinne says, putting her head around the door of the room that Larry is currently using as his office. 

�Sure,� he replies, �come on in.�

Larry is enjoying his trip out to Suffolk. He hasn't seen much of the Inward Bound facilities in action so far and it has been useful to see how Corinne has spent some of Clegg's investment. 

�How can I help?�

�I'm not sure. It may not be a problem, I guess. It's one of the participants in the current programme. Here, have a look at this, first of all,� Corinne tosses a folder across Larry's desk. �See what you think.�

Larry opens the folder. It's the transcript of the discussion between �Fifty� and Jo and a collection of print outs of the e-mails between �Fifty� and Angela. Larry reads them through, with a furrowing brow.

�And on top of this,� Corinne says, �there is supposed to be a problem with her payments, too. Together it all makes me feel uncomfortable.�

�OK,� says Larry. �Lets deal with this &#8216;research&#8217; question first.�


�I guess the main worry,� Corinne says, �is what happens at the end of her course. If she is using her time here as some sort of research opportunity, I mean. I'm not concerned by the academic analysis &#8211; I suppose I'll be interested to see what conclusions she comes to. And I don&#8217;t think she&#8217;d go shooting her mouth off to the media herself.�

�I thought you'd got the participants tied down with a sort of non-disclosure agreement?�

Corinne nods. �Yes, that&#8217;s why I don&#8217;t think she&#8217;d blow any whistles. I suppose I'm more concerned about what happens when she writes up her research. You can imagine the sort of grief we'd get if one of the tabloids found out about her research, can&#8217;t you? Those trolls have a way of turning even the most academic papers into something sensational.&nbsp; Now, while some of our clients are pretty up-front about their interests most of them would rather what goes on here weren&#8217;t spread across the front pages of the papers. I think it's manageable, but I thought you'd want to know.�&nbsp; 

�And the payment problem?�

�Well yes, that&#8217;s odd too. I just took a call from Fifty&#8217;s &#8216;safe contact&#8217; &#8211; you know the person they have for their bail out.� Larry nods. �It&#8217;s a Professor Angela Dawney at Fifty&#8217;s university. She&#8217;s saying there may be some problem with the final payment for Fifty&#8217;s last four weeks.�

�I thought you took the payments as a direct transfer from the participant&#8217;s account. If Fifty is here with us she&#8217;s hardly in a position to stop the payment.�

�We do but it seems that the bank account that Fifty gave us is actually some university account. There hasn't been a problem until now but Dawney says that she thinks there might not be enough to cover the final payment. She tried to sound like she being helpful.�

�Do you think she was?�

Corrine shakes her head. �Not a chance. I had the definite feeling that she was in &#8216;spanner in the works&#8217; mode. What I&#8217;m not sure is whether she&#8217;s trying to throw a spanner in our works, or in Fifty&#8217;s. In any case there can&#8217;t be a real problem because I checked the bank statements and Fifty paid up front in full. Maybe, Dawney is worried in case we&#8217;ve discovered what Fifty is up to and she thinks that stopping the payment is a way to get her out. Maybe, she just wants her girlfriend back.�

�I thought Fifty was married.�

�Yes, but &#8211; well -&nbsp; there&#8217;s definitely something going on there.� 

�Mmm, yes,� Larry seems abstracted. �Well, yes. Errm. I need to think about this. We don't need to do anything right now, do we?�

�If you're worried, I can pull her out of the course and send her home. It will mean a refund, but we can stand that.�

�No. No need for that. Like I said, let me think about it. If you're going to do anything at all, I'd just make sure that Fifty has plenty to keep her busy and not too much time for thinking.�

Corinne thinks about it for a moment. �OK. Well, Jo has already set up some more sessions for Fifty. It's about time she had another visit from Ylena, too.�

�I'll leave it to you, you're the expert.� Larry nods to Corinne. �But,&nbsp; I do want to talk to Whitechapel about this. They might be a bit sensitive about it, but I'm sure I can square things. Like you say the results of any research might be useful, anyway. I&#8217;ll get this young lady&#8217;s background looked into and &#8211; what did you say her name was? &#8211; Angela Dawney - we will have a look at her too.&nbsp; The two of them seem to be at the middle of a rather sticky web and I can&#8217;t pretend that I&#8217;m happy with it. Let&#8217;s see what I can find out.�

Corinne leaves Larry to it and as soon as she leaves the office, he picks up the phone to contact Clegg.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

�Hi, Larry, what's up?� Clegg sounds affable, Larry assumes that business at the old firm is going well. �I've got some of the team here. Hang on, I'll put you on hands free.� 

�Great,� thinks Larry. What he says is, �Hi, everybody.�

�Hey Larry, how's Suffolk,� says Dr Jordan. 

�Hi, Larry,� it's Elly's voice.

�Larry,� Connie chimes in.

�Well Freddie, I'm sorry to interrupt your meeting, but I just wanted to run something past you.� Larry describes Jo's interview with Jenny.

�And, Corinne doesn't think it&#8217;s a problem?�

�No, but then, she's taking it at face value. I guess my concern is that some of the competition could be trying to check out what Inward Bound is up to. There are a couple of businesses like Inward Bound and I wouldn't put it past any of them to sneak in their own little ferret. If I were facing a competitor like Inward Bound, I'd probably do the same and I'd use someone like this girl &#8211; although hopefully one that had a bit more control over her mouth.�

�Why don't you just ship her down here?� It's Connie's voice. �I'm sure I can divert her interest; take her mind off her studies.� Larry can almost see the glint of Connie's sharp little teeth.

�I'd like to keep this contained up here if I can, Connie,� Larry says.

�There is another possibility.� This time it&#8217;s Freddie speaking. �Maybe, she's nothing to do with your competitors. Maybe, it's one of my competitors. There's always someone sniffing around. We put a lot of people's noses out of joint with the Kushtian contract and there are Eastern European start-ups, who would be keen to put a spanner in our works, too.�

�I really don't think it's anyone taking an interest in your side of things, Freddie,� Larry is concerned in case Clegg wants to get too involved.

�Not sure I can take the risk, old man,� Freddie says. 

Larry has learned that when Freddie says �old man� you'd better watch your back. �Freddie, I really don't want any of your team trampling over the Suffolk operation.�

�I don't think we need to do that, Larry,� Elly's voice offers sweet reason as ever, Larry thinks. �Why don't we do a little research of our own? Check out some more of your problem's background. Harry's boys and girls haven't got a lot on at the moment. If it looks like a problem that affects us, we'll fix it. If it&#8217;s anything to do with your side of things &#8211; competitor or not &#8211; we'll leave it to you.�

Larry thinks for a moment. �Sounds OK to me,� he says. �Just tell Harry to be discreet. I don't want to hear that half the women at the university have suddenly disappeared.�

�Larry!� it&#8217;s Connie sounding offended. �As if, we would!�

�Are we agreed, then?� Freddie interrupted.

�Sounds fine to me,� says Larry.

�One other thing,� says Doctor Jordan. �You might like to turn the wick up on your problem's training programme. Maybe, one possibility is that with a little extra encouragement, she decides to sign up for a long-term commitment at the end of this.�.

�Hang on, Doc. That's leaping ahead,� Larry says. �But, you're right about intensifying her training. I've already got Corinne doing that.�

�Let me know if she needs a hand,� says Connie.

�Thanks, Connie, but I'm sure Corinne's team will do OK,� says Larry.

Freddie, brings things to a conclusion and Larry hangs up. Larry feels he&#8217;s got off lightly. Later that afternoon, Larry catches up with Corinne. �I've given things a bit more thought,� he says. �There's probably nothing to worry about, as we said. I'm just concerned, in case some of our competition is trying to pull a fast one.�

�Does that sort of thing really go on? Industrial espionage in this sort of business?�

�You'd be surprised. Anyway, I'm going to get McEwan&#8217;s background looked into. Just so we're sure there's nothing odd going on, but for the time being, I think we've got the right approach. Let's just keep her as busy as can be and make sure she gets the ride that she's paying for. Or, Dawney&#8217;s paying for, or whoever!�

It takes Harry&#8217;s team about a week before they feel that they have a picture of what&#8217;s going on with Jenny. Even then, it&#8217;s pretty inconclusive as Harry explains over a beer.

�I can't say that I see anything very sinister going on, Larry,� he says. �Leastways, as far as your inmate is concerned. We've done a whole lot of profile checks on her and as far as we can tell, she's exactly what she claims to be. The only thing that is different from her application form is that she is involved in a research programme, as you suspected.�

�OK, so what's the background on that?�

�Well, we managed to get into her office at the college and we've got copies of her research proposals &#8211; she's looking at stress and its impact on sexual responses, much as you thought. There are a couple of odd things though. Firstly, her supervisor on the project is...�

�Don't tell me. Professor Dawney.�

�Yepp. Who was also your girl's main squeeze for some time. If some of the e-mails on young Jennifer's laptop are anything to go by, the Prof wasn't entirely happy that the relationship came to an end.�

�And, she's McEwan&#8217;s phone-a-friend on this course, too.�

�Which means that young McEwan could be a bit out on a limb. Especially, given that the university may not know the full details of the research she is doing just at the moment.�

�How come? I mean, how come we know?�

�Checked the files in her office. There was no record of an approval from the Research Ethics Committee for her stint at Inward Bound.&nbsp; Research on human subjects and especially on students (your young lass qualifies twice there) should be approved before it gets off the ground. McEwan is registered as a PhD student, but there was no record of the Ethics Committee&#8217;s approval for the Inward Bound expedition. That&#8217;s supposed to be important.

�Which leads us to suspect that Mrs. Jennifer McEwan is probably on the straight and level, but that Professor Dawney isn't.?�

�Well, yes, but I don't think there's anything to get paranoid about. Except maybe this....� Harry plays an ace as he pulls out a photograph and passes it across to Larry. It's a photograph of Angela's desk. Harry points to one of the pictures standing on it.&nbsp; 

�I'm not sure what I'm looking at,� says Larry. �This looks like some gathering of the great and the good. Some conference or other, I suppose.�

�Exactly. It's the 14th annual conference of the Foundation for Behavioural Psychological Research, chaired by one Professor Angela Dawney, last year in St Petersburg. That's her in the middle.�

�I'm still not sure what I'm looking at.�

�I thought you might recognise the gentleman standing behind her right shoulder.�

Larry peers at the photograph again and says quietly, �Oh, shit.�&nbsp; 

�Exactly. Or, possibly. That's Anatoly Kustensky, isn't it?�

Larry nods. �I didn't have him down for in interest in psychological matters.�

�Why not? We are. He saw what we can do when we tried to ship him your ex-girlfriend. He'll have been keen to get at some of the same expertise that Connie's folk are using.�

�I thought Freddie was collaborating with Anatoly's people these days.

�Well, yes and no. You know how it is &#8211; partners on this, competitors on that. The lines get a bit blurry.�

�And, you think Anatoly may be using Dawney to find out more about what we're up to.�

�If I'm honest, Larry, no,� Harry says bluntly. �The problem is that Freddie does. And, you know how Freddie is, when he develops an interest in things. He&#8217;s made up his mind that Dawney and Anatoly are bed mates and deeply embroiled in some sort of conspiracy.�

Larry nods disconsolately, �Yes. Freddie does look for the dramatic. I mean we&#8217;ve nothing to suggest that Dawney even favours male partners, have we?�

�Well, no, not really. I found some conference papers in Dawney&#8217;s office. Kustensky did write a big cheque for the Foundation and they did co-host the end of conference dinner and she did get the use of a dacha provided by said Kustensky during the conference and for a fortnight afterwards.�

�And, did the dacha come with hot and cold running Kustensky?�

�Ha! Well that&#8217;s the question! There is a limit to what you can find out from one burglary but I found some snaps. You know the sort of thing: Some of the other delegates by the swimming pool; Anatoly being very chummy, making sure everyone had a good time.�

�Well, it all sounds a bid strange. What is Freddie&#8217;s take on this?�

�He wants to pull your McEwan girl out of Inward Bound. Thinks it will be safer all round if your business isn't exposed to risks from Anatoly.�

Larry nods. So far, it makes sense. Ex-KGB hoods stomping over the Suffolk site would hardly be good for business. If Anatoly were involved in any of this, then Jennifer would be much better out of there for a while. 

�He wants to give her to Connie to see what she can get out of her. I don't think there's anything to be found out, but you never know.�

Larry nods again. �But, assuming she doesn't know anything about it, where does that get us?�

�Freddie is due to see Anatoly in a week in any case. We're going to do some more research into the Professor's activities and Freddie is going to talk to him about it, if needs be. Face to face. He'll decide then what's to be done, but he'd like to have his hands on all the pieces before the start of the game.�

�Does that include Dawney?�

Harry looks uncomfortable. �Maybe, but not if I can avoid it. I'll want something to come out of our research that is bit more than the circumstantial stuff we've got so far before we go round to her place with our collecting bag.� 

�OK,� says Larry, �but you'll need to let me get things squared off with the Inward Bound folk and I don't want Mrs McEwan appearing in Freddie's 'for sale' catalogue, unless it&#8217;s absolutely unavoidable. Can we try to make this look like it&#8217;s all part of her 'experience' if at all possible?�

�I'll do what I can, Larry,� Harry says. �But, you know I can't make any promises.�&nbsp; 

Larry heads back to Suffolk rehearsing in his mind what to say to Corinne. It could be a very difficult conversation. It&#8217;s not as if he has ever explained just how Clegg Enterprises makes their money or exactly why Anatoly is a problem. He can&#8217;t really tell her everything can he? But can he tell her nothing? That&#8217;s the question! He runs through his options once more � and then decides.

In the dead of night Larry is woken from sleep by his mobile: it rings louder and louder and louder until he shakes himself awake and answers.

�Larry?�

�Yes.� He&#8217;s still dozy. He&#8217;s not one of those people that wakes instantly ready for action. � � Is that Corinne?�

�Yes, Larry,� Corinne sounds impatient, worried and angry all at once. �There&#8217;s been a serious incident at the Centre. Can you come over right away?�

�Yes, of course, but what on earth is the matter? You sound pretty chewed up.� 

�It&#8217;s Fifty. A group of men turned up at the Centre and arrested her. They&#8217;ve taken her away. I&#8217;ve no idea where.�

�Arrested her?�

�They said they were from the United States Department of Justice. They had ID and everything else you would expect.�

�Well who were they? Why did they want her? Do we have anyway of contacting them?� 

�How the hell would I know who they are? They bowled in, waved their warrant cards, or whatever it is they have, around, and took her. They left us a card with a number to call if we were worried. Like we wouldn&#8217;t be!�

�So have you tried the number?�

�Yes. It&#8217;s a US number, Washington somewhere. There&#8217;s just an answer phone message asking us to &#8216;call in the morning&#8217;. So that will be what? Two o&#8217;clock tomorrow afternoon our time?�

�OK Corinne, I&#8217;ll be right with you.� Larry knows he won&#8217;t get any more sleep tonight. �But don&#8217;t worry. Our firm has had quite a bit of support from the Foreign Office in the past and I&#8217;m sure I could access our contact there. Sounds as if this is really going to be a Home Office or Ministry of Justice issue but I&#8217;m sure I can find out where we go next or who we need to speak to. Have you be in touch with your solicitor or Fifty&#8217;s Safe Contact yet?�

�No, no we haven&#8217;t. I mean it&#8217;s the middle of the night and to be honest I&#8217;m completely out of my depth �.�

�It&#8217;s OK Corinne. Sometimes it&#8217;s best to try to sort these things out quietly, if you understand me. Don&#8217;t do anything until I get there. I&#8217;ll come over straight away.�

After he hangs up, Larry smiles. He yawns, showers, shaves and cleans his teeth. After all, a white knight has to arrive looking the part.

Chapter 22: Extraordinary Rendition
Memorandum
From: Jo
To: Corinne
Subject: Fifty �Rendition�
Corinne, I don&#8217;t know what the hell is going on and I want to put on my file my concerns. Whoever these people are, I can&#8217;t see that they should be able to do this. I'll accept your assurances that this is all being done legally and that it has nothing to do with the suspicions about Fifty&#8217;s activities here, but I want it to be very clear that myself, and the rest of the other staff are unhappy with this situation. Jo.

Memorandum

From: Corinne 

To:� Jo, Charlotte&nbsp; &amp;� The Team

Subject: Fifty �Rendition�

Jo, Here's a formal response to your concerns. 

Yes, Larry and I are just as concerned as you are. It seems astonishing that the American authorities can act as if the UK was just another part of the United States, but we&#8217;ve had legal advice that this is all allowed under US Law and UK treaties. Larry&#8217;s people are using their contacts in the Government to reach someone who can tell us just what is going on and hopefully help. I will brief the whole team just as soon as I have anything to report.

Corinne.

Jenny's Recollections (Day 40):

I'm absolutely petrified. What on earth is going on? I'm studying stress, and this is terror.

Last night I was put back in my cell as usual after a tough shibari session with Ylena. She had been as good as her word about the Russian flag. Red, white and blue ropes, white making a sort of harness arrangement around my head; a gag and a blindfold. Blue around my body; an intricate karada. Red around my thighs, my knees and ankles. Ylena is pleased with the effect. I have the same sensations as before. I find myself totally caught up in what Ylena is doing to me, completely absorbed in the feeling that every movements is held back by the pressure of the ropes.&nbsp; Ylena declared herself pleased with her slooga and then I was put back in my cell.

The bars locked closed, the shutters came down, the lights went out. I climbed into bed and pulled my blanket over me. There's no point in not trying to sleep and they keep us so busy that I need the rest anyway. Sometimes, I turn over the day's events in my mind trying to make sense of it all for whatever it is that I'm going to write at the end of this. This night though, I fall asleep pretty much straight away.

I wake up. I've no idea what the time is. All I know is that it's still dark. There's some noise coming from outside the cell, voices arguing. The shutter of my cell starts to go up. Light streams underneath it. As the shutter goes up, I see the cause for the noise. There are five men, all smartly dressed, dark suits, white shirts, dark ties, crew cut hair, dark glasses. All of them are solidly built. They all seem to have one earphone, with a curl cord disappearing beneath their collars. One of them, he looks a bit older than the other - his face lined with experience, is waving a sheet of paper at Charlotte, while Jo is standing with her hand on the switch that opens the door to my cell.

�I'm glad you decided to co-operate Ma'am,� the man with the paper says, in an American accent with a tone that is both polite and clipped. Charlotte looks as though she's not happy with whatever is going on. Jo looks annoyed, as well.

One of the other men walks across to the bars of my cell and calls in to me. �We're sorry to disturb you at this time, Ma'am. Could you stand up, please?�

He holds up a chunky mobile phone towards me. He looks at the screen and looks at me and then looks at one of the other men. 

One of the other men disappears only to come back a few moments later. �Here is the picture modification from Langley, Sir.� He hands the first man another mobile. The first man holds it towards me and then nods to another of the group. �That's a confirmation, Sir� he says. 

Another man approaches. He holds up an official looking ID card. I can read the words&nbsp; Agent Elmer Black, Department of Justice. �Jennifer Alison McEwan. You are being detained in the custody of the Authorities of the United States.�

The American continues, �We have information that you and your associates are involved in activities prejudicial the interests of the Government of the United States and you are being detained for further investigation and questioning. Legal representation will be arranged for you at an appropriate time. I'm afraid that you have to come with us.�

�But why? Where? What's going on?� I'm pretty disturbed by all this. I can feel my pulse racing and it gets no slower when I realise that each of these men has a bulge in their jacket that suggests they are carrying guns.

�I can't explain that here, Miss, I'm afraid. You&#8217;ll be aware that we are at liberty to detain any foreign national suspected of offences against the US legal code. The Agency simply asked that we arrange with the people here for you to be transferred to our facility. I'm sure that it will all be sorted out there. You will appreciate that in matters of electronic espionage and sabotage, counterterrorism and Homeland Security the Western Governments and ourselves collaborate very closely.� Charlotte and Jo are looking on, mouths open in surprise.

I'm confused. �What do you mean, counter terrorism?� I'm thinking 'Agency'? What is this, the CIA, or something?

�You have links with Russia and certain individuals suspected of involvement with electronic sabotage.�

�No.� I say �No, I don't.�

�I'm sorry, ma'am, our information is that you are married to a Joseph McEwan, who was engaged in projects around the Sea of Azov prior to his current activities in Cambodia.�

�Well, yes.�

�And, you don't think that constitutes 'links with Russia&#8217;?�

�Well, no. But well, maybe, I suppose...�

�Don't worry, ma'am. I'm sure we can sort this all out.� He turns to Jo. �Open the cell doors, please,� he says. Jo shrugs and does as he asks. �Thank you Ma'am.� He beckons to me. �If you could walk this way, Ma'am.� I look at Jo. She shrugs again. There doesn't seem to be anything else for me to do. �That's very helpful Ma'am,� the older man says.
The men all surge in. Two of the silent heavies grab one of my arms each. Someone else passes and fastens wide belt round my waist and my wrists are clipped to each side of the belt. It only takes moments. Someone else again pulls a leather helmet over my head and laces it firmly, the laces at the back. I am blind and dumb and helpless.

I hear Charlotte say, �Is that absolutely necessary?�

�We don't tell you how to run your operation, Ma'am. I'm sure you'll agree we're best able to assess our own security procedures and approach. We carry out a strict risk assessment for every transfer.�

They're holding me tightly, but not viciously, although it&#8217;s perfectly obvious that if I try to make a sudden move there is no chance I'll be allowed to go anywhere. I can just hear the American speaking to Jo, �The Department of Justice is very grateful for your cooperation, Ma&#8217;am. I&#8217;m sure I do not need to remind you that these events should remain confidential.

The man continues, �and this is, of course, covered by the provisions of your own Government&#8217;s Official Secrets Act.�

I am marched out of my cell, one of the heavies on each side, up to the ground floor and outside. There is the sensation of cold air on my naked flesh as we go outside and I'm lifted into some sort of van. My hands are re-cuffed to one of the seats, doors slam and the car sets off. The whole incident has taken hardly any time at all.

I've no idea how long we drive for. It's hot and stuffy with the hood still over my head. Neither of the men touch me at all, but I'm wedged between them.

Now, we're going quite fast, at a steady speed and on a relatively smooth road. It must be a motorway or a dual carriageway; we don't slow down or turn sharply for quite a while. Then, we're on to stopping, starting, turning and bumping again. And then, we stop.

There's the slamming of car doors. I'm expecting to be pulled out of wherever I am but nothing happens for quite a while. They've forgotten me! Of course it's a ridiculous thought, but then, it's a crazy situation. Then there's a clunk, cold air on my flesh again and my hands are released from the seat, clipped once more to the belt and I am out of the van still with the hood over my head. 

�Mind your feet, Ma'am,� a voice says. �There's gravel here for few yards till we get to the Facility.� The gravel is sharp under my feet, but it&#8217;s only a few steps until I'm on stone and then through a door inside somewhere and there's wood or some warm surface beneath my feet.

I'm gripped by the arms again and hustled along again for a way, still with the hood over my head. Eventually, two sets of hands take me and I'm put down on the floor. Except, it's not the floor, I'm kneeling on cold metal bars. They push me forward from behind. There's a clang and a click. I try to move. My back and head bang against bars above me. I try to twist around and my shoulder hits against metal as well. My wrists are dragged behind my back and fastened together. My ankles cuffs are fastened too. The hood is unlaced, unstrapped and pulled off my head. I can see that I've been pushed into a tiny cage, not high enough for me to sit up in, not wide enough to let me turn around. There's a heavy padlock on the door. Even if I can get my wrists free from my cuffs, I couldn't get out of the cage. I'm in a dimly lit room. Two of the dark suited men that took me from Inward Bound, (or I suppose two other identically dressed men, how can I tell?) are standing looking down at me. One of them lifts his hand and gives a circling wave. I feel the cage start to move. In no time, it's ten or twelve feet off the ground, spinning slowly on a chain somewhere above my head. As the cage spins, I watch the men leave and I see that there are four other cages hanging from the ceiling of the room. What have I got in to? 

I'm in the cage for what seems like a lifetime. The bars are cutting into my knees, I cannot really get my feet into a position where they can help support me. I am cramped and cannot straighten out without banging into the bars. If I do try to move, the cage starts to swing. 

The next development gives me no comfort, either. Suddenly, the room is filled with light as lamps set into the ceiling inches above my head come on. It's dazzling; they're hot. At the far end of the room the door opens and in strides the most daunting looking woman. My first sight of her makes&nbsp; me catch my breath. She's dressed as conservatively as the men, dark suit, white blouse, sunglasses. I can see that she's black, darker even than the picture of Diallo Ramatoulaye that Gerry had, or so it seems in the harsh light. She strides down the room getting closer to me all the time. Predatory. In charge.

The woman approaches my cage, takes off her shades and peers up at me. She turns and clicks her fingers. I feel my cage start to lower, going down until she is looking me straight in the eye. She smiles, but I don't sense any warmth. Her teeth are as white as her blouse. She reaches out and prods the cage, watching as I spin in front of her.

�Hmmm. Interesting,� she's says, peering at me. �We're going to have a real interesting talk about you and how your friends in Russia are these days and what they are up to.�

I have no idea who she is or what she is talking about. �I don't know anything about this,� I say, �I've never been to Russia. I&#8217;ve got no Russian friends. Sure, my husband worked out there for a while, but he hasn't got anything to do with the Russians beyond that. He was just part of trying to fix some of their water problems. That&#8217;s the only thing he has to do with the Russians.�

�No, of course. We know that. This isn't about him.�

�Oh,� I say, �but your people said...�

She shakes her head. �No, it&#8217;s not about him. It&#8217;s about you.� 

I'm about to say something, but she carries straight on. �Now, don't interrupt Connie,� she says. It&#8217;s the closest she gets to introducing herself.&nbsp; She takes a final look at me. �We'll meet again soon. Don't worry, we'll have a long talk,� she says. I'm worried. And scared.

Connie turns on her heels and strides back towards the door, her heels tapping their way across the room. The lights go off. This time, it's pitch black. 

By the time they come on again, hours have passed and this time the dark suited men come back. My cage is lowered onto a trolley. They disconnect it from the chain that has held me aloft and I'm wheeled off, still in my cage. I'm rolled into a small room, one of the men unfastens the padlock on the door of my cage, the other helps pull me out. I'm so stiff that I sprawl on the floor at their feet.

�You'll get used to it, kid,� one of the men says.

�No, she won't,� says the other, with a laugh. 

I start to get some feeling back in my limbs, but all I can do is to stretch out on the floor. I'm groaning with discomfort, but my distress doesn't seem to disturb them. I'm worried that they think I'm going to be here long enough to actually get used to it and I still don't understand why I'm here.

I get the chance to learn more when Connie comes in. She's wearing black trousers, a white shirt and a tight black waistcoat that fits under her bust. All I can do is stare up at her as she strides into the room. Her whole presence radiates power. She turns to one of the men. �Can she stand?�

He shrugs, reaches down and unfastens my ankle cuffs. He steps back without helping me further. It's pretty obvious I'm going to have to do it on my own. I wriggle round and manage to get onto my knees. My thighs and calves are aching, stiff from being confined in the cage. My knees are grazed from the bars of the cage and my shoulders are bruised and scraped, too. Connie watches as I carry on trying to get up. It's not easy at the best of times with your hands locked behind your back, but I manage it. I'm not too steady on my feet and lurch over against the wall. 

Connie seems impressed. �Not bad,� she says. She takes a good look at me, turning me this way and that. �All right. She's not in too bad shape. Get her showered, clean up those grazes and scrapes. I want an assessment on my desk by the end of the morning. OK?�

�Sure,� says the taller of the two men quietly. Connie is obviously in charge here.

�Any difficulties with the collection?� Connie says.

�No. The people there were perfectly cooperative. They were quite happy with the paper work..�

Connie nods and goes, leaving me with the two men. One of them helps me to straighten up, warning me to keep quiet. I try to ask them why I've been brought here, what is to happen to me. They ignore my questions, telling me to shut up if I don't want my mouth strapped shut again. I take their advice.

They hustle me away to a shower block and then to see a medic who looks me over, dabs my cuts and grazes with antiseptic and then declares me fit. She gives me a sort of orange robe, a bit like a hospital theatre gown. It has a badge saying �Detainee�. I put it on feeling strange, it&#8217;s the first clothing I've worn for a long time. It all feels a bit like when I first arrived at the Inward Bound Centre, but this time it's all more brutal, more matter-of-fact, like I'm on some sort of production line!

I'm taken back to see Connie again, this time in her office. As I'm brought by one of the heavies in suits there's another girl &#8211; her secretary, I guess - giving her a folder. It looks like some I've seen in the offices at Inward Bound. Connie doesn't look at me, she just goes on studying the folder. 

�Well,� she says, �this is interesting. It's not often I get to deal with someone that has actually signed up for slavery.� She looks up. �That presents us with an opportunity. Sometimes, it can be a bit of a problem what we do when we've finished these interrogation sessions. There's too much focus on some of the Agency's detention facilities now. I'm going to need some advice. Depending on what comes out of these discussions, maybe when we've finish we can just extend this contract,� she pulls out a copy of the form that I signed when applying for the Inward Bound course, �or maybe we can sell you on somewhere. Save us all the embarrassment? Unless, of course, we have got this completely wrong and you can &#8211; well &#8211; go back.�

I'm confused. My emotions are swinging between abject terror and blinding anger. Who are these people and why do they think that the Inward Bound agreement gives them any rights over me? I think back to when I first got to Inward Bound, and Anna joking suggested that they should sell me. Surely, they didn't mean that sort of thing seriously goes on?

�Excuse me, but what right has anyone from the United States to come and arrest me and start threatening me with prosecution?� I say.

�I think we'll do me asking the questions,� Connie responds. �But to put your mind at rest, I&#8217;ll tell you just exactly how. First, thanks to your Extradition Act 2003, our people merely have to make an extradition request and off you go. No court hearing in the UK needed anymore. Second, as one of the people from our Department of Justice pointed out to some people from your Court of Appeal, if a suspect is apprehended abroad and returned Stateside, you go straight to jail pending trial and your kidnap in the UK cuts no ice with our Judiciary. You&#8217;re a suspect and my colleagues and I are intending see you safe behind bars as soon as possible. OK?�

Connie&#8217;s explanation of the state of the world leaves me gasping at the arrogance of it and terrified at the extent of my predicament. She nods at my escort. He grips me by the arm and forces me to the floor until I'm lying sprawled flat out in front of Connie's desk. He grabs the back of my head and pushes it around until my face is pressed against the wooden floor. He spreads my arms out so that my hands are in front of my head, palms down. He kicks my ankles apart, spreading my legs. �Thanks,� says Connie. �That'll do for now.�

I hear the suit leave, shutting the door behind him and then I hear Connie's chair scrape on the floor as she pushes it back. There's the tap of heels on the wooden floor as she walks around from behind her desk. I don't dare look up. From the corner of my eye with my face pressed against the floor, I can just see the tip of the toe of one of Connie's shoes. �Now let's talk about your&nbsp; travels on the internet and what you do at the orders of your boss and especially what you do for one Anatoly Kustensky,� she says.

�I don&#8217;t go on the internet, at least anywhere you would be interested in.�

�I have just explained the seriousness of your present situation.� Connie's heels tap on the wooden floor as she moves away from my head. �You'll really have to pay attention.� I feel something hard running up the inside of my thigh, like a stick or &#8211; Oh no! I realise what it feels like &#8211; one of Ylena's canes. The stick flicks at my robe, I feel it fall open behind me exposing my buttocks. Now listen to Connie and answer my questions. Tell me about your friends, the friends who ask you to hack our Department&#8217;s intranet�

�I told you I have never been to your site. Anyway, I couldn&#8217;t hack anything, I&#8217;m no computer specialist.�

�Try again.� Connie's tone is becoming irritated, but I don't know what I can say. 

�It&#8217;s the truth, I haven't.�

�I'll help you,� Connie says. �Tell me about Anatoly Kustensky�

�Who? No. I've never heard of him.�

�Well, what about this man? What did he ask you to do?� Connie stoops down and puts a picture on the floor beside me.

�Nothing. I have never seen him either�

�Well, I&#8217;m getting impatient because I know for a fact you see him quite often. Think carefully: twenty-five years without parole is a long time ��

�I&#8217;m sorry. I&#8217;m really sorry, but I have never seen him. �

�Tell me about your boss.�

�Professor Dawney?�

�Just how many bosses do you have?�

�Just the one.� I&#8217;m starting to get confused. �Professor Dawney - she is the supervisor for my thesis.�

�That&#8217;s all?�

�Yes.�

�What about Kustensky?�

�I told you, I don&#8217;t know him.� 

�I have to disagree, Mrs Jennifer McEwan. And, it&#8217;s going to be a long time before you see Mr. McEwan if these answers don&#8217;t get a lot more honest, because we both know that you and Professor Dawney used to share a bed and she was not pleased when you left&nbsp; to become Mrs. McEwan.�

�How do you know that?�

�It&#8217;s our job to know.�

�Well, yes but that was three years ago and ... �

�And, you continue to see her.�

�But, I can&#8217;t get out of it. I work for her.�

�Does Joe know about the two of you?�

�No, I well, he ��

�Do you love him?�

�Yes, of course. What&#8217;s that got to do with anything?�

She ignores my question. �But, not enough to be honest?�

�Yes, well no, well it was over between Angela and me and � �

Connie walks back towards my head, the tip of her stick trailing along my side as she does so. I'm terrified that she's about to lose her temper and start hitting me.

�You collaborated?�

�With Prof? Yes, I&#8217;m supposed to.�

�So, you and your lover collaborated to keep your husband ignorant of your affair? And, what else did this extend to?� She's standing by my head again. She rests one of her feet lightly on the back of my hand. There's no pressure, but it feels if she shifted her weight by the slightest amount she could punch right through it with the heel of her shoe.

�Nothing. Nothing at all. I meant she collaborated with me on my project, that was all.�

�And, back in your bedroom?�

�What?�

�In your bedroom. Was that 'psychological research' that went on there?�

�Nothing went on in my bedroom. She never came to my flat.� She's touching the back of my neck with her cane now.

�Oh, so you used to go to hers?�

�No. I told you there was nothing like that. Besides, I am now in another relationship.�

�We know. With Professor Dawney.�

�No, with Joe, my husband.�

�Did you find it easy, sharing?�

�Sharing! What on earth are you talking about?�

�You, Professor Dawney, and Joe. Very liberal minded, very intellectual.�

�No, it wasn't like that; it wasn't. I don't know anything about this. None of it is true!�

And, what about him? Connie taps the picture again, gently with the tip of her cane but her very gentleness seems so dangerous. You didn't meet Anatoly Kustensky with Professor Dawney?�

�No, never.�

I hear the tap of Connie's heels on the floor. She's returning to her desk. �You can get up now,� she says.

As I scramble to my feet, I see her press a button. One of the suits appears. 

�I've finished with her for now,� Connie says, without another word to me. �Put her back in her accommodation for now. And, see that she's safe.� 

He takes me downstairs in the building to a large bare room. He puts me in one of what they call the accommodation cages &#8211; they're bigger than the cage I was put in first of all and made of wire mesh rather than heavy bars. 'Seeing that she's safe' means 'cuff her hands, so she can't get up to anything and strap this gag on her so she can&#8217;t call out.' There's enough space in the cage so that I can sit up and move around a bit. There are eight cages in this room lined up along the walls, four along one wall, four along the other. A solid partition separates each cage from its neighbours. All the other cages are empty. Each of the cages has a water bottle with a tube sticking through the bars. I could get a drink if it wasn&#8217;t for the gag.
 
I'm still only wearing my orange �Detainee� robe, but at least they haven't chained my ankles. I've been here about an hour when Connie's secretary turns up. Her English voice is so calm and matter of fact, it sounds bizarre in these terrifying surroundings.

�Oh, I hope you're all right in there. It looks like you have enough room. Connie said to check. She likes to make sure things are done just so. Anyway, she says she wants me to take you down to her. She wants to have another chat.�

I don't like the sound of this. You here all sorts of things about what goes on in these sort of places, but there's nothing I can do as she opens the cage and helps me out.

�Anyway come along,� she says in a friendly tone. �I'll take you over there, if you like.� 

I'm not sure I do like, but with my wrists cuffed behind me I can't really object as she leads me out of the office. 

The room she takes me to looks like a gymnasium. Wooden bars line the walls to either side. Mirrors cover the walls at either end of the room. 

Connie is there waiting for me; she straps a leather blindfold across my face and I am manoeuvred into the middle of the room. My feet are pushed apart and there is the sound of furniture scraping across the floor. 

What feels like a plank is passed narrow side up between my legs. It brushes my labia. I have to raise just off my heels to avoid it. Various clicking noises follow. A strap is attached to the front of my collar and one behind. I cannot move either forwards or back. My ankles are loosely re-joined beneath the plank. I wince as someone spreads a cold jelly across my pussy.

Connie speaks again. �Well Ms Jenny. We can do this the hard way or the easy way. Easy is where you just tell us what you are up to? Huh? Hard is �� She pushes me down onto the top of the plank, which is rounded and smooth and at once there is a biting feeling in my labia. It's as if I have run my tongue across the contacts of a battery, but worse because it was so unexpected. I jump back onto my toes. 

Connie continues. �Hard, is your legs get tired and you sink down onto the pony and the pony gives you a bite. Up you go, back onto your toes and then you get tired and down you go and you get bitten again, maybe harder this time. Up you go again, but not for so long because your legs are getting so tired and maybe starting to cramp and down you go and BITE! Up you go and then you really start to ride, baby! Up, down, up, down, riding the pain from your muscles and the pain from your clit. Now, I can tell you don&#8217;t believe me, do you? Well, let's give you a chance to do some thinking.�

I want to call out, �No stop, there's nothing more for me to tell you.� 

Connie calls out to the others there, �Boys leave her gag and blindfold on. I don't want her to have any distractions! You, young lady, I'll give you oh, an hour &#8211; or maybe two. Enjoy!�

It all happens just as Connie said it would: my calves tire, I sink down, I feel the electric shock from the �pony� as she called it, I rise again to my toes and I am eventually forced through tiredness to sink down. Soon, I am sweating and writhing on the plank and mewing and crying and then someone comes: the electricity is turned off, the gag is unstrapped and my blindfold is removed.

Connie is there, sitting in a chair. She looks up. �Well?�

�I&#8217;m sorry,� I cry.

�Sorry for what?�

�Sorry for, I don&#8217;t know, for not telling you what you want to know.�

�We only want to know the truth.�

�Please, I want to tell you the truth.�

�The truth about what?�

�Why I went to Inward Bound, the truth about that, then you'll see there's nothing else in this.� 

Connie leans forward, �So, why did you go?�

�Well, ... well....�

�Baby, I haven&#8217;t got all day. Do you want more thinking time?�

�No, no please. Look, I wanted to do the things Joe and I never do and Angela had this idea.�

�Joe and Angela, huh? Joe is an engineer isn&#8217;t he?�

�Yes.� 

�What does he do &#8211; exactly.�

�I don&#8217;t know, exactly.�

�Don&#8217;t know exactly? Wrong answer.� Connie gets up and leaves the room. I try to call her back, but she ignores me. I had not noticed, but the plank of the pony had been lowered by one of the Heavies, so I could stand. He raises it back up. Ahead, I can see a green LED. It changes to red and the pony bites. I&#8217;m straight back up on my toes but really struggling to stay up. The red light fades to green. I sink down. Now it's just my labia crushed against the plank. It&#8217;s a faint relief. Suddenly, the LED is red again and I&#8217;ve been bitten, hard. I&#8217;m right up on my toes again � and so it goes on. I&#8217;m working between the inescapable tiredness in my legs, and the cycling of the current and just crushing myself on the plank. Tears begin to flow again. I&#8217;m really pouring perspiration and feeling very thirsty all at the same time.

Then, Connie comes back and relief comes, of a sort. �You were saying?�

�I, I don&#8217;t really know what Joe does. Not really. Not exactly.�

�Don&#8217;t know, or don&#8217;t want to know?�

�Don&#8217;t know.�

�Jenny, do you know how much of a threat cyber terrorism is to the economy of the United States and Europe? Especially, state-sponsored cyber terrorism. Do you realise how much of a threat to the financial markets identity theft is? No. You don&#8217;t, do you? Not surprising, I guess, given that your own government can&#8217;t keep its own data safe! Do you know what we think?�

I silently shake my head.

�We think that you were recruited by your professor, or the man in the photograph, maybe. We think this gave you access to the academic networks to get cyber attacks out into the wider web. Blackmail a legitimate business by threatening to shut down its website or its accountancy or its billing software. You collaborated, because you did not want Joe to find out about you and Angela. You can&#8217;t be honest about your sexuality and you can&#8217;t stand up to Angela&#8217;s blackmail either.

I am silently shaking my head, tears in my eyes, spilling down over my cheeks.

Connie stares at me and sighs. �And, unless I start to get some honest answers, you are going to jail for years and years and years. No plea bargaining with felons who won&#8217;t face up to what they have done. Nope. Just years in jail. Don&#8217;t suppose Joe will still be around for you when you get out, will he? I mean twenty-five years is a long time to wait for someone who can&#8217;t be honest.�

And all the time, I am shaking my head and silently crying. 

They take me off the pony; I am given water and then they put the gag back. They all leave. The door is locked. I am alone. Shaking. Sprawled on the floor, still blindfolded. Crying silently. Governments can&#8217;t let this happen to their own people, can they? Can they?



Chapter 23: An Uncertain Future

Inward Bound Files

Memo
 
From: Jo &amp; Charlotte

To: Corinne

Jo and I are writing this because of our continuing concerns over the recent incident with Jenny McEwan. While you may have received reassurances from the US authorities or whoever it is that this is all being done legally, we are both concerned that this organisation owes a duty of care to McEwan.&nbsp; We should be actively trying to either gain her release or be confident that these people have acted completely within the law.

It seems to us that we should take some legal advice on this matter because of our own involvement in McEwan's presence here. Have you had any contact with the Foreign Office, the Home Office, the Ministry of Justice or whoever this might come under that can give us any comfort on this? Should we as an organisation be trying to contact someone else that could help such as Liberty or Amnesty International or one of those other human rights organisations? Maybe even the media?

Corinne, we both think that we ought to be doing something about this and other members of staff are pretty worried, too, about one of the guests going missing on their watch.&nbsp;&nbsp; 


Memo - Confidential

From: Corinne 

To: Jo &amp; Charlotte 

You are right, of course. I&#8217;m concerned about Jenny too and worried about our exposure. There&#8217;s no need to involve any other agencies. Larry tells me that his contacts say that there should be a rapid resolution. Give it a couple of days and I should get some more details. We can discuss it then.

Larry, the whole business with Jenny McEwan is really upsetting things here. People are worried both about McEwan and their own position. I really need to be able to say something reassuring about what's going on and I can't go on saying �Larry&#8217;s contacts say it&#8217;s going to be all right�. Even if people believe it then there aren&#8217;t many that would be easy with the Americans being able to carry on like this inside our country.

I really need to be able to give them some practical comfort, or you need to get McEwan back here within the next day or two, at most.


Memo

By way of an update, see the copy of the attached from Corinne at Inward Bound. As you can see she's pretty concerned about her ability to keep the lid on things there. I'll talk to Connie and make sure she pushes on as quickly as she can. If we can make up our minds about McEwan quickly, then I think we can contain things. I really don't want a situation in which the Inward Bound folk suddenly discover a desire to chat to the media. The alternative is that we have to come up with some sort of alternative cover story for what we're up to and I don't want to start improvising at short notice. I'll go see Corinne and the team and reassure them.


Jenny&#8217;s Recollections (Day 40):

They take me from the gymnasium and put me back in my cage. I sleep fitfully. Sometimes I'd wake and I'd be aware of someone in the room watching me.

Daylight comes. They feed me. A dish of cereal and fruit pushed into my cage and then I'm left alone.

Someone comes to check my water bottle and refills it. I'm left alone again. I'm still the only one here; still in my orange robe with the badge, �Detainee�.

They let me out of my cage to use the toilet but they put me back in straight away. No one wants to talk to me. No one will tell me how long they intend to keep me here. Then there's more food.

It's later. Connie's secretary appears, looking slightly flustered.

�Oh, good you are here. I was sure you would be.� I'm thinking, where else would I be? �Anyhow, Connie wants to see you again.� She sees the look of fear in my eyes as I back away in my cage as far from her as I can get. �No, it's all right. She doesn't want to question you. I think they've done what they need to there. Why don't you come with me?�

Done what they want? But do they believe me? Are they just going to send me away somewhere? I am relieved that there may be no more questions and sick at what might happen now and the anxiety of just not knowing. Gingerly, warily, I climb out of the cage. Connie's secretary fastens my wrists behind me, clips a leash to my collar and leads me out of the room.

She chatters away as we walk down the corridor. I'm wanting to ask her what this is all about but I don't get the chance to break in to her constant stream of talk. �You'll find Connie very helpful. She's ever so good with all the detainees ... She works too hard really but she doesn't listen to me.... I suppose she really likes what she's doing. Well, you'd have to wouldn't you? Otherwise you wouldn't put up with it.&nbsp; And she's on call 24x7. I mean take you, turning up here at two in the morning. Of course she knew you were coming but you can't ever be sure what time Harry's people are going to arrive. Anyway, here we are, this is Connie's play room...�

Play room??? Now I am worried.

The room she shows me into has echoes of the one in which I first encountered Ylena. There's the same rather plush, comfortable feeling although this one has more of a Middle Eastern or Moorish feel to it. There's also the same disturbing array of paddles, floggers and whips in racks on the wall plus a lot of other stuff that makes one wall look like a display cabinet in the store that supplied the members of the Spanish Inquisition.

My escort sees the look of shock on my face at the array of 'toys'. �Now, don't you worry,� she says, �I'm sure that Connie will go easy on you, at first. She's not had such a bad day, today and you're new, of course.&nbsp; Well as long as you didn't upset her when she was questioning you. You didn't, did you?&nbsp; Sometimes, though, I wouldn't want to be in here for anything! Goodness you'd be surprised how irritable she can get. Takes it out on anyone that gets in her way. Now, I wonder how she'd like you?�&nbsp;&nbsp; 

In my mind, I'm begging this woman to chain me up and go away; anything to escape from the constant chatter. Eventually she comes to a conclusion. �This will do it,� she says guiding me towards a wooden pillory at one end of the room. She unfastens my wrists from behind me and strips off my robe. She positions me at the pillory and slides the wooden bar down fixing my neck and wrists in place. I'm standing, bent slightly forward, with my hands at shoulder level. The woman takes two lengths of chain and fastens them around my ankles. She pulls the chains through rings on either side of the base of the pillory until my legs are spread widely apart as far as they will go. 

The woman says, �That should do.� The chain is taut and I'm standing almost immobile. �I'll let Connie know you're here. I'm sure you won't have to wait long.�

There's no rush, I think, but before I can say she's gone, leaving me alone in Connie's play room.&nbsp; 

I don't know what I'm expecting next. Right now I'm feeling strange. It's almost unreal; as if I've been dropped into some bizarre fetish novel. I'd pinch myself to make sure I wasn't dreaming if I could only get my hands out of the pillory.&nbsp; 

Given my state of confusion I'm not sure how I expect Connie to look when she comes in to the playroom. As it is she turns up dressed just as she was in the office. I'm almost disappointed but she still exudes a sexual power. In spite of my being drawn to her erotic charge. I try to protest. �What is all this? I answered your questions. I've nothing more to say.�

�Don't be silly,� she replies, softly reassuring, as if sensing my true feelings. �That was work, this is play.� She looks across at me. �Oh, good,� she's says. �I can always rely on Sarah. That's just right. Mmm, we're going to have such fun.� Somehow, I think that the fun might be a bit one sided. Connie stands quite close to me. �I get so tense after a long day,� she says. �It's a real treat to be able to unwind in here.� She unfastens the waist band of her trousers and steps out of them, unfastens her waistcoat and slips that off. She unbuttons her blouse. I'm drawn to her every move, each action is performed with the deliberate, sensuousness of a wild animal. Some sort of cat, I decide. A panther, I suppose.

�They did a lot of work on you, didn't they?� she asks, reaching out and tugging gently on one of my nipple rings. �You didn't have these before you went to Inward Bound did you? Or,� she grips my nose ring, �this.�

�No, Mistress,� I say, almost surprising myself by calling her that. I don't know why I fall so easily under her spell. This must be outside any standing orders that she, or her agency had. They can't treat detainees like this. It must be covered by the Geneva Convention or something. It's barbaric, but I don't object.&nbsp; 

�Very good,� smiles Connie, �at least you've learned some basic manners.� She's looking straight into my eyes - I can't look away from her hypnotic stare. She moves behind me and runs her hand, slowly down from my neck, and the other down between my breasts, across my belly and down to my sex. By the time it reaches between my thighs to part my cunt, I'm lost. I don't try to fight her as she strokes the soft flesh. To my shame I find myself pushing forward as she moves her hand away. �And not just manners, I see,� Connie grins.

�Look at this, here!� she says. I feel her touching my buttocks. I know I still carry the marks of Ylena's last beating. �This was done by someone that knows what they were doing,� she says. �And you took it too, didn't you? Evenly spaced strokes, absolutely parallel. You weren't struggling, were you?�

It never occurred to me that I'd be betrayed by the marks of Ylena's cane, but it was true. �No, Mistress,� I say remembering how I'd lain so still, desperate for each successive blow. 

�This is very good work.� I feel a single finger tracing the line of one of my wheals. �In fact I think .... � She breaks off as if she's decided on something. She goes across to one of the racks on the wall, I'm worried that what she's decided is what she's going to do with me. �I shan't beat you,� she says over her shoulder. �It would be a shame to add to that pattern. Like painting on another artist's canvas.� It's only as she turns back towards me that I realise what she is going to do. She's smiling, licking her lips in anticipation. Her white blouse is hanging open, her white bra draws my eyes to the dark chasm of her cleavage. But then my glance travels down to the great white phallus she has strapped on with a harness about her hips. �But that doesn't mean there aren't other things we can do with that pretty little bottom.�

�Nnooo!� I say, recalling the confused mix of discomfort and pleasure when Ylena had penetrated me there, �no, please don't ... �

�Ah, don't be reticent, little one� exclaims Connie, �it's so good to feel filled. But, just in case you feel a little distress, we'll use one of these. She picks up something from the rack and advances towards me. It's a ring gag. I've seen them before but the Inward Bound people haven't used one on me. I'm shaking my head as Connie reaches me, but she's is not to be denied. She pushes the ring into my mouth and twists it somehow, so that my mouth is stretched wide open. I give a strangled �Gnnng� noise. She fastens the strap at the back of my head and from behind me I feel her stroking my back and buttocks.

�There,� she says. You can cry out all you like. I so like the sound you'll make with this. Lose yourself, little one, lose yourself.� She slowly wipes some tingly lubricant across my anal bud and, as she begins to press the dildo against the cheeks of my arse, I can make only a whimper but I know I'm already losing myself to this woman. I feel the dildo press inside me, filling me more than the probe that Ylena used on me. Connie's belly is warm against my back, the cool silk of her unbuttoned blouse, brushing against me as she leans forward. �Cry for me, little one. Learn to do your best for Connie,� she whispers as she presses herself close, pushing the dildo home. She reaches around to my tits, pinching and pulling at them. I'm dribbling around the ring gag. She pulls and then presses forward again, sliding the dildo inside me. I gasp at each thrust.

..............................................


It's much later, I've been taken back to my cage, but now they wake me up.

Connie wants to talk to me again. I'm taken to her office. This time, it's all much more relaxed. She's sitting behind her desk. I'm even allowed to sit, my naked backside cold against the stiff leather of the seat that faces her.

She doesn't mention our earlier encounter. I'm staring at her as she sits, composed and relaxed.

�Now, let's have a conversation about you and the Russians.� Connie has evidently decided that continuing down the track of pressing me about Angela isn't going anywhere. 

�I don't now any Russians.� I can't imagine that I'm going to be any more help to her than I have been so far.

�Curious, given that Professor Dawney is so cosy with them.�

That's true, at least. She's always off to conferences in St Petersburg, or Moscow. �She never involved me with any of her meetings.�

�Not even in the UK. She didn't get you to 'entertain' any of her Russian contacts when they were over here?�

�No!� I exclaim indignantly, although it's quite the sort of thing she might have done if she'd thought of it. �I've told you I don't know any Russians.�

�How about this man?� She pushes a photograph towards me. It&#8217;s the same photograph she showed me before. 

I look at it closely. He looks familiar but I don't remember meeting him. I shake my head. �I already told you, no. I might have seen him around the university but I don't recall meeting him. Ever. Who is he?�

�But, this is someone you see often!� 

�Where?�

He stands next to your Prof in the photograph on her desk. The photograph that&#8217;s been there for months. You are supposed be observant. You see, that sort of mistake makes me think you know exactly who Anatoly Kustensky is.�

It means nothing to me. I remember the photograph on Angela&#8217;s desk but I don&#8217;t remember seeing this man in it. He could have been there but I really don&#8217;t remember. I shake my head. 

Connie takes back the photograph and puts it on the desk. �Do you know, I would like to believe you but it just does not wash. At some stage you are going to have to come clean about what you have been doing for him. Either now or after we ship you to our secure facility at Guantanamo, Cuba. You must have heard of it. It&#8217;s that little tropical paradise that the press and those lefty liberals reckon is some kind of hell on earth. And by the way, it can take quite a while for your case to come to trial while you rot away there. And that&#8217;s before you start your sentence� she says. Not surprisingly I&#8217;m sick with worry as I am taken back to my cage.

Another night passes. I sleep fitfully on the floor of the cage. All at once, the lights come on. Connie marches into the room, followed by a small posse of her secretary and two heavies. Whenever she appears, there is no doubt just who is in charge. It's as if she distorts the fabric of space-time&nbsp; by the sheer gravitational energy of her personality.

I am in still waking up. She gazes through the bars of my cage at me, then crouches down, her face a few inches from my own. I can feel my heart sinking. What else can they want from me? What else are they going to do?

�Well, Miss Fifty, I have some good news and some not so good news. Langley has decided you might be clean after all. That&#8217;s the good news. What do you think of that?�

A very small voice comes out of me, �Can I go home now? Please?�

�Go home????�

�Well, can I go back to Inward Bound?�

�Well, maybe, that's the not so good news. You see, we might not have enough to take to Court but we have enough to make us very anxious and we just don&#8217;t feel easy about sending you back into the arms of Angela and Alexander. Then again, people are so critical of the work we do. So, we can&#8217;t just let you go and blab to the first newspaper you happen across, can we? They might not appreciate how important our work is here, mightn't they?�

I am shaking my head ��

�No, they won't. So, what's to do, Huh?�

�Please, let me go back to Inward Bound. I'll sign anything you want. I'll keep your secret. Why not?�

�Ooh, only a dozen or so reasons,� Connie smiles. �But maybe.� I don't get the impression that she's seriously considering it. �There are the other options we talked about though. Remember? Extending your contract? Finding a buyer? We know people that could put you right away from anyone you ever knew. That might be better than some of the other options. Decisions, decisions, decisions, just what to do ��� 

Connie&#8217;s speech has left me feeling as if I am going to wretch. �You're joking! You must be joking.�

Connie turns to her secretary.&nbsp; �Where are our friends with their next catalogue?� Connie asks her.

�I spoke to them this morning. Their sale is in two week's time, Ma'am,� she replies. �The catalogues have already gone out. They can put out a supplement, if you wanted to include this as one of the lots.�

'Sale' &#8211; maybe they are serious. 'Lots' &#8211; you can't talk about people as 'Lots', but they do. 'This' &#8211; she says, 'This.' Shouldn't it be 'Her'? I mean not that I'm encouraging them of course, but 'This'! 

Connie looks pensive for a moment and then makes a decision. �Arrange for her to be appraised and valued. Get the details entered up and we'll decide in a day or so.�

What the hell is 'appraised'? Appraised is what I used to get by my head of department. These people may use perfectly ordinary language but somehow I don't think they're going to be giving me points for �problem solving ability� or �leadership skills�. 

�Of course, Ma'am. One of their valuers said he could come out, if we wanted.� she responds. 

Connie turns to me. She motions to two of the ever present heavies. �Give her some better accommodation. See she's fit and rested by the time the valuer turns up. I'd like to see whatever they have to say then. Clear?�
 
�Yes, Ma&#8217;am,� replies one of the Heavies. He has come into my cage and is taking my arm, half lifting me as he steers me towards the door.

Connie calls after us. �And, tell that valuer we aren't looking for his usual bargain basement price here. If we've got the inconvenience of having this young lady around at least we might make a few dollars on the exercise.�

This time I am taken to a new cell which has a mattress of sorts and two metal bowls on the floor, one with water and one with more muesli and water. They must use the same cook book as they do at Inward Bound. My hands are free now and I can bend over the bowls to eat and drink and at last I am left alone to sleep �.

After the cage and the hard bed at Inward Bound the mattress is almost too soft but I'm soon asleep. When I wake I feel better than I have for some time. I can get up and move around; stretch my limbs, yawn and scratch without anyone looking in on me. It's a few moments bliss but then I remember why I'm here in these 'luxurious' surroundings. They can't really be planning to sell me can they? That sort of thing doesn't go on does it? And, even if it does, a government agency couldn't be party to it. Could it?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
There's the sound of a key in the lock of the door to the cell. I look up from my mattress as the door swings open with a crash. One of the heavies is standing in the doorway. �On your feet,� he says and stands back without waiting for a response to let a tall, quite heavily built man into the cell. He looks about forty-five with shortish curly hair. He's wearing a sports jacket over an open neck shirt and jeans. 

�Is this the one?� he asks. The heavy nods. �Hmm, not too bad at first glance, I suppose. I mean, normally, we like them a little younger, but there's sometimes a buyer for something a little more mature.�

His whole attitude is like he's looking over a car in a showroom. Whatever the appalling reality of the situation; that annoys me. Mature! I mean, for fuck's sake, I'm only 28! I tell him so.

He's not pleased with my reaction and turns to the heavy. �I thought you said she'd been through training.�

The heavy shrugs. �I can cuff her if you like. There's a gag around here somewhere, too, if that's needed.�

�Let's wait and see. Listen young lady,� - he turns back to me - �in our business almost anything past twenty counts as 'mature' so I wouldn't get too upset. Now, put your hands on your head, stand still and if you don't want to spend the rest of the day chewing on a two inch rubber ball, I suggest that you find a way of restraining that nicely pierced tongue of yours.�

I'm startled by his blunt approach and quickly do as he says. 

�Better,� he says. He reaches into his jacket pocket and pulls out a small hand held computer. He pulls a stylus from the side and taps the screen a few times, peers at it, and mutters �fucking technology� under his breath. He walks up to me and starts examining me, jotting down notes every few moments. He checks the movement of my arms and neck, opens my mouth and prods around inside it, feels my breasts and belly, stretches a rubber glove onto his hand and prods a finger into my vagina; all without comment. He waves for me to turn around. I feel his hands running across my shoulders and back down and around my waist, he feels my buttocks, and runs his hands over my thighs and calves. �Well, physically all right, I suppose, nothing special but fit enough. Tits aren't too bad, buttocks neat enough. Nice tight arse; that will be popular.� He's chatting away to the heavy as he examines me, making notes on his PDA. �Not sure about the shaved head; some folk like that, but it's better if they get to make the choice after they've seen what the lot looks like with their hair on. And that tattoo! Not my style but pretty dramatic. It'll have some appeal, but it needs finishing off.�&nbsp; Yes, I'm thinking, let me go back to Jonathan, he can do it. �She's quite intelligent, I understand. That may be a draw back of course, sometimes it means they learn quickly, mostly it just makes them stubborn. Don't kid yourself,� he says to me, �most of our buyers aren't looking for Scherazade, they're happy with a warm cunt that knows when to shut up.�

He makes some more notes on his PDA prodding at it with his stylus. He sees the scar on my forearm. �She's been chipped? Oh that's handy.� He waves the PDA over the scar. �OK, well she's on the register. Consensual, I see, but we won't let that worry us, will we?�

�Please,� I beg, �tell me this isn't happening. Tell me it's all some sort of joke.�

�It depends on your sense of humour, I suppose,� the man says with a smile. He turns back to the heavy. �I'll need to talk to your boss,� he says. �It's a bit hard to predict a price for a lot like this. I'm guessing though that the price isn't significant, you'll just be looking to move her on, so we won't bother with a reserve. Maybe you want to put a restriction on which territories she can be taken to and we need to know if it&#8217;s you or the buyer that's providing transport. Do you know?� The heavy looks blank, like he'd just been asked to explain Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs. �I guess not,� the man goes on. �I'll talk to your boss. Can you get some photos of her. Usual thing; full face, both profiles, full height front and back; close up on labia and arse bud; better do one of that tattoo as well.� The heavy manages to understand this. He nods. �Otherwise, I&#8217;m finished. Thank you very much young lady. Hope to see you in the Sale Room.� 

The man closes his PDA, tucks the stylus back in its case and returns it to his jacket pocket. He smiles and nods.
 
The two of them leave me locked in the cell; I'm more terrified than ever before.

It's late when Connie comes to my cell. She looks like she's been in her playroom, I'm glad it wasn't me she's been playing with. She's wearing a skin-tight leather cat suit, zipped open at the front almost to her waist, ankle top boots in the same white leather. Her skin by contrast seems jet black; it&#8217;s glistening slightly from the sweat of her exertions. I watch fascinated as a drop of moisture forms close to her neck and runs slowly down, diving into the crevice between her breasts. I'm almost compelled to lean forward and kiss each bead of sweat from her body.

She knows the effect that her appearance has on me. She doesn't comment or try to do anything to make it easier for me. She squats down at the foot of the mattress and smiles across at me. �I'm aware,� she purrs, in a voice smooth with the relaxation that only sexual pleasure can bring, �that we haven't talked about your options. 

�I didn't think I had any,� I say, sitting up, drawing my knees up to my chin defensively. Connie, undisturbed, continues to contemplate the line of my thighs.

�Mmm, of course. I thought I said that you had..�

�I thought you had decided to 'sell' me. Whatever that means.�

Connie smiles, as though she hadn't imagined that such an idea would be anything except obvious. �What it usually means. Someone parts with money. In exchange for which they get rights, usually exclusive rights, of possession, use and disposal.�

�Of a human being?�

�In this case, yes.�

�But that's slavery for real. It's illegal. Apart from anything else, you're a government agency. You're not above the law.�

�Well, no not exactly, assuming anyone came after us. But then, who would they send? Don't worry about legality. Lots of things go on that aren't legal. You just have to worry about reality. And besides there are choices, as I said.�

�Like what?�

�Places you go to willingly. An extension of your contract. Your life will be much as it has been lately, but you will have had some control over what happens to you. You will have made the choice.�

�Such as?�

�We have contacts with members of the Royal Household in a country on the western edge of the Hindu Kush. They are looking to employ someone to help teach the household English. Someone of your intelligence would be a suitable candidate. Of course, it is a less liberal culture than you find here, so your life would not be so different from now, but for a royal concubine there...�

�Concubine! And this is supposed to be better than being sold into slavery?� 

Connie shrugs. �Perhaps a role in their ministry of culture; they need English speakers. Of course your duties would include serving the Minister, as well as the Ministry, if you see what I mean...�

�No, not that. No.�

�There are other possibilities. We have contacts in Zimbabwe. I know someone looking for a house servant. In fact, they are specifically looking for an English woman. I think they quite like the idea of the previous colonial rulers in a position of subservience.� Connie licked her lips. �There are other contacts in Korea, The Gulf States, Colombia,.... If you prefer a more physical assignment there is .... �

�I'm assuming this is some kind of brothel?�

�Oh, no, actually, I was thinking of something else entirely, but if that were to be your preference than there are plenty of ...�

�No, no! How is any of this better than being sold?�

�You make a choice. You go willingly. That means flying in the cabin of an aircraft not unconscious in the hold. You travel with a minder, not in a crate. You aren't kept in restraints, as long as you show no sign of wishing to abscond or of not conforming to the terms of your agreement. You'd only be punished for a significant breach of rules. We'd stay in touch with your contract holder. Well, as long as we could. You probably wouldn't be sold on. �

�Only probably?�

�Well, we can't guarantee what happens in some of these places. Once you're out of our jurisdiction, there's not much we can do but, for what it's worth, we're talking about people that have an interest in keeping us happy, so they're not going to get too far out of line if there's an agreement in place.�

�And, if I'm sold?�

�Well, then it's down to whoever buys you. We don't control the auctions. You could be lucky and get bought by someone as a companion for their aged uncle in his twilight years.� I must have looked unbelieving. �No, you're right, it&#8217;s not very likely. Mostly it's for sex. Usually, somewhere primitive. Just for as long as it takes to get tired of you and then you're back in the auction room, with a slightly cheaper price tag going to a slightly rougher buyer and so on and so on.�

I'm staring at her in horror. It's true then. I can choose to be a slave or I can be taken as one. I can make a choice of my owner or have my owner choose me. I can accept that I am someone's chattel, or I will be taken as one anyway. I guess my bleak expression lets Connie know that I have understood the choices.

�I know it's difficult,� she says, standing up. The frisson of sexual desire I felt at her arrival has been dispelled by the horror of the situation. �But, you don't have to decide right now. We're getting the appraisal and valuation anyway. If you're not going to be sold at least that way we'll know what you would have fetched on the open market. Have a think about extending your contract. I probably shouldn't say this, but I think that might be the best way for you - being that bit older, you'll be starting off with a disadvantage. Oh, and if you could remember a bit more about exactly what your Prof and her mysterious friend wanted you to do, that would be very helpful indeed. To someone in your position.� 

She winks at me.

I nod. In this lunatic's discussion, of course I can see that her logic is impeccable. I cannot fault her analysis, but I still fall sobbing as she leaves my room.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Chapter 24: Some Restorative Justice

Jenny&#8217;s Recollections (Day 44):

The photo session is possibly one of the most humiliating experiences of my life. Worse than having Jo watch me on the toilet back at Inward Bound. Worse, maybe than when Jo showed me the video of me masturbating. At least, then, I felt I was still a person. This time I just felt like so much meat.

It is one of the heavies that comes in to do it. He doesn't even speak, just waves the camera at me like I am supposed to understand what he wants. He pulls me and pushes me this way and that. The worst part is when he wants pictures of my labia and my backside. He gets me to spread my lips and then to spread my buttocks while he takes the pictures. I'm pretty sure he takes more than he needs to. He takes some close ups of my tits, too, and he gets me to put out my tongue so he can take one of my stud. I don't remember the man asking for those either.

He ends up drooling almost as much as I did the time Connie put a ring gag on me. I'm glad when he goes and leaves me alone again.

I'm spending a lot of time alone. Plenty of time to think. Too much time. Time to think about what might happen to me.

Connie's secretary appears&nbsp; She's got a pile of clothes which she gives me and tells me to put on.&nbsp; I've given up being surprised by what goes on here. I just do as I'm told, although this feels really strange. I haven't worn clothes for over a month and they feel coarse and stiff against my skin. They're nothing special - just underwear, a loose skirt, a tee-shirt and a pair of sandals&#8211; but it feels extraordinary to put them on. 

One of the heavies is with her. It's the one that took my photographs. He gives me a grin of salacious recognition, as he takes me by the arm in a vice-like grip.&nbsp; 

�She's not very happy, you know,� says the secretary as the heavy manhandles me out of the cell and along the corridor. I assume she's talking about Connie. �Not happy at all. University friends of yours. Threatening to involve Amnesty International for heaven's sake. How absurd. They ought to worry about oppressive regimes, not bother with free western governments that are only protecting their citizens' interests.� Her rant against the liberal left continues all the way to Connie's office.

Connie is waiting looking as cool, collected and efficient as ever, although her tight lipped expression hints at annoyance. �Jeez,� she says, �you're one hell of a lot of trouble for someone of zero added-value.� I don't say anything. Connie goes on, �Did you think any more about our conversation of last night?�

No, I think, of course not. You just gave me the choice between being sold into slavery with some unknown maniac who thinks he can buy and sell women and giving myself up to the same situation. I just dismissed it from my mind. I imagine that sarcasm is not required at this point. I nod silently.

"Well, let me just go over it again. If I decide you are not being cooperative enough, we'll just dispose of you on the open market, no choices. You will be pleased to know that we had a good report about you from your valuation, so your sale will be reasonably profitable for us. I have to say that's our preferred option, frankly, easier for us anyway. We don't really have to worry about you from that point on, we can't really keep contact with someone once they&#8217;re into the sale circuit. Alternatively, assuming you are being cooperative we can get you a long-term contract with one of our contacts. That way we would still keep in touch with you. Check you are still OK. We would be a long way off, but still in touch.� 

She's presenting this as a benefit. I'm not sure whether it's a good thing for them to be in touch with me, or not. But she goes on anyway.

�There is the Contessa, for example. She likes to use her slaves for a sort of sex circus and she is in the market for someone to team with a wonderful hunky guy she has just bought. I just know you could create the most fabulous performance........And then there is a client of ours in Thailand. He wants someone to tutor his children and someone who could keep the young men of the household out of mischief. Nice climate. I expect he would keep you naked ......... He is very rich by the way, so your cell could be quite comfortable.�
&nbsp; 
Connie can see that I'm getting more and more distressed. 

�Alternatively again, if you are very, very, very cooperative, I might just send you back to Inward Bound.� She sees my look of hope. �Yes, it's back on the agenda. We've got a visitor and you get a chance to listen in on our chat. Maybe I'll need you to say something. If you want to have half a chance of going back to your friends at Inward Bound then you're going to be very well-behaved.� 

I'm thinking, why on earth should I believe you? But, then again, what does it matter?

�Now, little one, it seems like there are various possibilities here that we want to explore with your friend. First is the two of you are working with the Russians. Dawney is ex-KGB maybe; the Russians get her to recruit you to work for them. It wouldn't be the first time they'd used a dyke like her to get someone like you on board. So, there's you and her working as a cosy little pair.� She takes in my look of disbelief and ignores it. �Or, maybe, you don't even know you're working for her. Jenny, the innocent dupe? Do we believe that? Maybe, maybe. She seduces you, sets you up with Joe so she can put the squeeze on you later to get at him. That way, she gets you happily doing her bidding which at the moment is informing on certain commercial operations. Plausible, you must admit.�

�Only if you're completely paranoid. Oh, sorry, you're some sort of government agency aren't you? I forgot.� Connie's ramblings seemed bizarre to me and I was getting more and more angry but she ignored the sarcastic remark.

�Or, maybe it&#8217;s simpler than that. Maybe it's you, Joe and Dawney. A cosy little m�nage � trois with a little bit of spying on the side. Dawney gets to bounce with you, while Joe's away. He gets to bounce you both, when he gets home &#8211; hmm, less likely according to our information on Dawney but you never know. I know - Joe gets to watch you and Dawney. Not the most uncommon male fantasy, you'll admit. Maybe, he gets a kick out of being cuckolded by a woman?� I'm staring at her in disbelief &#8211; how can she just conjure this sort of wild speculation? �Anyway probably doesn't matter who does what, with which, and to whom, because there's the three of you all happily enjoying each other and feeding our Russian friend whatever tit-bits he asks for.� 

I&#8217;m angered by the absurdity of it all. �You seem to have overlooked the possibility that there's nothing going on. Or, doesn't that fit in with what your agency wants to believe?�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
�Luckily you don't have to worry about that. All you need to do, if you want to keep the chance of going back to Inward Bound on the agenda, is just to be as cooperative as you can be. If we need you to tell our visitor that you're perfectly all right, and that there's no problem, then you will. OK? Now stand there.� She gestures to her side. �Ah! Here is someone you know. Let's hear what she has to say...� 

I don't know if it is OK but I'm prepared to do as she says. Anything, to get out of the hands of the people here.

Connie presses a button on her desk and the monitor on the wall starts up to show a room somewhere else in the building, I guess. One of the heavies is standing beside a woman sitting on a chair. She's got some sort of loose leather hood over her head, but that doesn't seem to be interfering with her objections to her treatment. �This is ridiculous,� she complains. �It's just so melodramatic.� The hood is pulled from her head. It's Angela.&nbsp; She scowls at the heavy. She peers around the room and finally stares at the camera.

�Professor Dawney,� Connie begins, her voice, distorted by some electrical circuitry, echoes back from the other room. 

Angela looks up at the camera. �Who are you? What do you want?�

�Your assistance, Professor, in our enquiries.� The distortion of Connie's voice has a metallic quality, but Angela's responses are clear. 

�Enquire away. I'm doubtful that I know anything of benefit to the security services. Ours or anyone else's.�

I'm watching her closely. She seems so composed. 

�You're responsible for supervising research projects?�

�Yes. Of course.�

�Psychological research.�

�Yes.�

�And, all your projects are cleared through your ethics committee?�

�Of course.�

�You are a member of the Foundation for Behavioural Psychological Research? You attended their conference in St Petersburg last year?

�Is that what this is about? Russians? They are all academics. Our work is open to all. Everything is published. There are no secrets in my field.�

�None?�

�No.�

�Not even 'An Analysis of Sexually Induced Stress In The Female'?�

I'm puzzled. Why are they quizzing Angela about my project. She's seen nothing of it since the original proposal. All the data is here &#8211; in my head.

�Ah &#8211; that's more of a trial, some evaluation of possible approaches, nothing more at this stage.�

Now, I'm indignant. This is going to be my doctoral thesis.

�So that's why it&#8217;s not been cleared with your ethics committee?�

�It doesn't need to be at this stage. It would only be cleared, if there were significant work involved and a doctoral thesis might result. So far, it's just some postgraduate exploration. It may come to nothing. It only involves one member of the department working on her own initiative. I took the decision that there was little value in clearing it. I allocated some limited funding on my own authority.�

I'm more than indignant.

�So, you've not discussed it with colleagues from abroad? It's not formed part of the international debate?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

Angela shakes her head. �No, it's really only a codicil to some of the work I'm doing. Just some supportive research.�

I'm angry. She said this was important. That she'd discuss it with the Group. That I'd have the chance to make a name for myself with some really original work. It sounds like she was just using this to extend her own influence with the Group. That if there was anything useful, she was just going to absorb it. And, maybe she's encouraged me because of her and me.

�And you've not discussed it, shall we say, outside the academic community?�

�Why would I?�

�Maybe for some commercial sponsorship, perhaps? Universities always need funds. Seeking commercial applications for academic research would be part of your brief.�

�Yes, but not it in this case. I told you, it&#8217;s not important.�

Not to you, maybe, I'm thinking, but it was, is, to me.

Connie isn't deterred by Angela's obstructive manner. �So, maybe we'll talk some more about you and the Russians. Have you worked with them long?�

�Oh, maybe five years. They have always had a strong presence in this field.�

�We know. It's been of considerable interest to their security services and ours.�

�I wouldn't know.�

�Come on, Professor, you must be aware of their interest in the induction of psychoneurosis by conditioned reflex with stress? That work has been going on since the sixties.�

�I don't have any involvement with the security services. This conversation is helping me to understand what a good decision that was.�&nbsp; 

�So, you made a decision about it? When did they approach you?�

�No one approached me. I mean, not in so many words. I imagined that they were using their own work in those areas.�

�So, when they told you to recruit the girl and get her involved with Joe McEwan ...�

�They did no such thing. Nobody told me to get Jenny involved with McEwan. There isn't any they. I don't have any involvement with Russian security services and I didn't get Jenny involved with anyone.�

�So it was you and Joe, maybe?�
&nbsp;&nbsp; 
�Listen. Get this straight I have no involvement with the Russian security services.�

�Did I say security services? The Russians are like everyone these days. There are plenty of private agencies. Private enterprise is no longer a dirty word there. Maybe, some industrial&nbsp; or commercial espionage, perhaps? We get as interested in&nbsp; that as anything else. Very hard to tell the difference these days between state interests and commercial interests. I think you've got a lot more to tell us Professor Dawney and I'm not happy with what I've heard, so far.� 

Connie&#8217;s mobile rings.&nbsp; Connie says �Thank you, Professor. Please wait for a moment.� She flicks the microphone off and lays the mobile on the desk between us so we can both hear her conversation with the caller. I stare at the black rectangle which will declare my fate to me:

 �I've just come off the phone from talking to the boss. He's had a word with the Russians.�

�So do we have a problem?�

I'm thinking, never mind this. Please, what do you want me to say to Angela? I'll say anything to get out of here. It doesn't matter. I just want to go. Please. But, neither Connie nor the caller seem concerned with me any more.

 �No. The boss seemed quite amused by the whole exchange.� 

Amused! They are putting me through all this and this man is amused!

�He said that the Russian's exact words were, 'You think I need lousy English research on stress? When I have people who've lived through Stalin and Beria? Your country! You think stress is when your football team don't do too well. You come talk to some people from the Gulags, if you want to know about stress!' That&#8217;s pretty much par for the course with the Russian according to the boss; expresses himself forcibly, you could say.&nbsp; He definitely didn&#8217;t feel that anything being done over here was any sort of world-class operation. As for why he was involved with the Foundation, the boss is pretty convinced that his Russian friend was just using it as some sort of tax hideaway for a few roubles or dollars or whatever that he didn&#8217;t want to declare. Maybe, there&#8217;s something there we should be interested in, maybe not. Anyway the boss isn&#8217;t interested in your guest or Dawney. For now at any rate. Unless, something else turns up to change our views.�

Connie looks thoughtful. She reaches across to where I'm standing beside her and strokes the stubble on my scalp. �Well,� she says, �it sounds as though you're not too much of a threat to international security, after all. Maybe we should let you go back to your playground. At least, until we do find some further evidence.�

The mobile speaks again:&nbsp; �That was the boss's view.� I'm feeling hopeful now that these people will let me go after all. That they'll let me go back to Jo and Charlotte and the others.

�The appraisal and valuation was positive though. A good price at auction.� I'm scared again.

�How about Dawney....?�

 �I don't think there's anything else I want to ask her,� the mobile responds.

Maybe you don't, I'm thinking, but I do. I want to know what the hell she has been playing at.

�She's been a real pain though. Caused us a lot of trouble. She's even,� Connie reaches out to stroke my head again, �even caused this young lady some real problems. I think I'd like her to feel that she really hadn't ought to play these games.�

�Does that mean you're planning to play some?�

Connie raises an eyebrow. �Would you mind very much?�

�Not as long as you don't do anything inconsistent with the Agency's policies.�

�As if I would,� Connie replies, with the air of someone who feels that gives her a lot of latitude. She flicks off the mobile and turns on the microphone again. Angela is sitting on the chair with the hood back over her head. The heavy has one hand on her shoulder, holding her down in the chair. �Thank you, Professor,� Connie says. �That concludes our questioning &#8211; for the time being.� There's a muffled grunt from under the hood. �For the moment. We appreciate your cooperation in our enquiries. You've been a great help, so far. I'm afraid you'll have to stay here for a while until we have the chance to check out your statements.� There are more muffled sounds that I take to be Angela's protests. Connie's next remarks are addressed to the heavy. �Check the Professor into the accommodation suite,� she says. �And, see that she's well taken care of.� I get a glimpse of the heavy helping Angela to her feet, as the screen cuts out again. She's trying to make some sort of complaint but the sound has gone, too.

Connie's secretary appears. �This one needs to be made ready for shipment,� she says pointing at me and I'm quaking again at the prospect of what's about to happen.

�But, the sale room can't take delivery until the weekend,� the secretary says. 

�No, we're not going to do that now. She's to go back where she came from.�

I'm relieved. The secretary looks put out, but seems to cheer up by the time we've left the office. �You'll be pleased to be going back, I'm sure. Of course, the shipment is a bit uncomfortable but I guess you'll be happy when you get to where you want to be. I'll put you back in the room you had before. At least, that will be comfortable for now. We won't be able to do any shipments before the morning, so you should get a good night's rest and then we can sort everything out tomorrow.� Of all the things at the Agency I'll be keenest to get away from, it's the constant chatter of Connie's secretary.

I'm back in my room. It's quiet. I'm sitting on my mattress thinking about Angela and the things she said. Wondering if there has been any point to this experience as far as my career is concerned. If the university hasn't sanctioned it, then, maybe they won't let me publish. Maybe they won't consider it for a doctorate. But, the more I think about it, the less worried I am, the experience has been a lot more important than any research project could be. If I can survive all that has been thrown at me over the last two months, then petty empire building academics can't harm me.

I'm feeling more happy than I have been for a while, when Connie appears and immediately I'm quaking again. What if she's had a change of mind? What if Angela's said something that means they can't let me go? She simply holds out her hand for mine and says, �Come with me.�

She takes me along corridors to another part of the facility. I guess that we are near where I first arrived and was kept, suspended, in my cage. 

Connie sits down on the desk, leaving me standing. She looks across at me. �So, she's not very supportive of you, your boss, is she?�

I'm still angry about Angela's comments regarding my work. The more I think about it, the more of a betrayal it seems. Now, having Connie bring it up just makes the tears well up inside me. �No,� I say, tears running down my cheeks. 
 
�Hmmm, well being a bitch of a boss isn't something even we can intern people for. We think you're both clean as far as we are concerned.�

�Does that mean I can go back to Inward Bound?�

Connie nods. My relief is overwhelming. �Sure, you can go back to Inward Bound, but what are we going to do with her?� Connie gestures to a lap top. There on the screen is a picture of Angela, obviously a surveillance photo snatched, as she came down the steps of the University Library. 

�Can't you just send her home?�

Connie laughs. �Sure, baby, sure. You're very generous. I don't think I'd let her off so lightly if I were you. We thought maybe you two had something to do with some Russian activities that are &#8211; how does the jargon go &#8211; 'not compatible with their diplomatic status'. But, do you know what? We don't think you are, leastways not you. The question remains, though, what are we going to do about her? We want to be real sure before we put her back on the streets.� She has a sly smile as she looks at me. �I want you to see the Professor,� she says, opening a window on the screen of her laptop. I find myself staring at Angela again.

Angela is discovering the consequences of upsetting Connie. �Well, Professor Dawney,� Connie calls through microphone, �I'm sure your friends at Amnesty have said that the Agency is responsible for all sorts of despicable treatment of its detainees. I just want to reassure you that this is all being done with your best welfare in mind.�

I find Connie's reassurance hard to accept and I'm certain that the Professor will too. She's been strapped into a heavy canvas straight jacket, her arms crossed and then strapped down and the buckles locked off. A strap from the front runs down and beneath her crotch, but they haven't bothered to take her skirt off before fitting it and the skirt is all caught up in the strap, showing her legs.

�We know there's a risk for those in close confinement to self harm and we have to ensure that you couldn't do that. The hood is designed to prevent any risk of detainees gaining access to drugs. Perhaps you wouldn't think it much of a risk; but it is. Don't worry. You'll be given food and water regularly. Of course it may take a few days for us to finish our enquiries, but I hope you'll bear with us.�

The growled response from Angela convinces me that she's gagged under her hood.

Connie shuts down the laptop. �It doesn't repay her for the trouble she's caused you, but she may learn a little over the next few days,� Connie says.

I can't agree with her, it seems barbaric to me in spite of Angela's treatment of me. But, on the other hand, I can't bring myself to object, either. 

I can&#8217;t help it. I start to smile very broadly. Partly it&#8217;s relief and partly, well, it&#8217;s seeing Angela getting her just desserts. Connie sees my smile and raises her eyebrows. 

She turns to me. �So, little one, you are enjoying your boss&#8217;s discomfort are you?�

�Yes, I&#8217;m afraid I am,� I admit.

�So is she getting enough of what's good for her?�

�No!� I surprise myself with how emphatically I respond. I have to confess to feeling mischievous and more than a little vengeful after her remarks about my work. �She might be a bit too warm. With clothes on I mean.�

�Really?� Connie sounds amused. �So, what else should I do to her?�

�Er, well, I don&#8217;t know. Perhaps. Well, maybe she shouldn&#8217;t be able to move around too much. She might hurt herself, bang into something in that hood. Perhaps, she should be strapped to her chair or chained to the wall or� Well, I&#8217;m not sure, err, Mistress.� It seems the right way to address Connie, given the circumstances.

�It's different when someone else is the victim, isn&#8217;t it?

�Yes, Mistress.�

Connie chuckles. �Never mind, I'll think of something but I like your own suggestion at least for starters. �By the way:� She gives my nose ring a gentle tug. �Is this permanent?� 

�No, Mistress� 

�Well, maybe I&#8217;ll have to do something about that �.. a little souvenir of your time with us.�

She changes her tone. �Turn around, Fifty!� 

I turn immediately.

�Hmmm, your bum is returning to normal. Pity. What are you doing tonight?�

�Er, well Mistress. I mean, I thought you said you were sending me back to Inward Bound, I mean I don&#8217;t know ��..�

�It would be a shame to leave you all locked up alone on your last night, don&#8217;t you think?� I don't get the chance to reply. �I think we should spend your last night together ��. I&#8217;ll send Sarah to collect you. You can look forward to being marked by the experience,� she says with a smile.

�Thank you, Mistress!� I respond, though I'm not at all sure that I'm looking forward to it.

After my evening meal, I am taken down to Connie&#8217;s lair, and find her naked and clearly anticipating a good evening&#8217;s entertainment at my expense. 

Even naked, perhaps especially naked, her emotional gravity commands attention. Her body is athletic and tightly muscled. She is pierced like me, except the rings through her nipples and her nasal septum are gold.

She has Sarah strap me to a frame and takes down a flogger from the rack. Aesthetically, it&#8217;s very beautiful. The tails are made from blue, red, white, purple and black leathers. If I&#8217;m to be whipped, then this is what I want to feel across my skin.

She begins gently, bright showers of sparks of pain falling across my back, shoulders, buttocks and legs. Slowly and almost lovingly she increases the tempo &#8211; we have all night she tells me &#8211; until the sparks have been fanned into fiery kisses covering me from my ankles to my neck and I am lost in reverie! I am slowly climbing to orgasm. Gasps of surprise become cries of pain, which become whimpers of desire. She senses my growing ecstasy (who could fail?) and the whipping stops. I stand breathing hard (as if after running) and stand writhing and squirming, cruelly denied my climax. But then, erotic cruelty is her forte.

She takes me to a pillory. It&#8217;s like the one where I was secured before, but it isn&#8217;t as tall. She bends me over, bum out, body forward and locks me in it, my head down at waist level now. She lubes my bum and opens up my sphincter with a gloved finger, further and further. In time, her fingers are replaced with a butt plug. It opens me more and my sphincter swallows one ridge, then another and closes around a final small rim, keeping the plug secure. She is not finished, though. She weaves a rope harness between my legs and around my waist. �Must keep you nice and full for your trip back home, honey!� she says

I realize that there is a knotted cord in the rope harness which presses insistently on my clit. Her gloves are off and she walks round to look at me. 

�This ring?� &#8211; she tugs my septum ring &#8211; �it&#8217;s through a grommet. That&#8217;s nice! Let&#8217;s see &#8211; hmmmm a four millimetre grommet. You would look good with a thicker ring, not too large, but thicker. Try this &#8211; perfect! You know that should stay. Yes that should stay!� She removes the ring and returns the new ring which now carries a chemical smell with it. �Now honey: I&#8217;ve sealed it closed with epoxy.�

I give a squeal of alarm. I can guess what that means.

�That&#8217;s right,� Connie smiles, �You&#8217;ve guessed. That&#8217;s what you do to make them permanent. That is not coming out. Ever. And do you know the best bit? It&#8217;s the heat from your own body which accelerates the set! You could release it if you could get your hands on it, but of course, your hands are snuggled in my pillory, so just enjoy!� She can see that I&#8217;m distressed by thus turn of events but she takes no notice. �Now,� she says, �it&#8217;s time for you to pleasure me, don&#8217;t you think?� 

She draws a chair up in front of the pillory and slips down: it brings her cunt right opposite my lips.&nbsp; �So lick, baby. Let me feel that tongue stud gently play with my clit. Taste all of me. It&#8217;s the best! But, just make sure you take me all the way.�

She is asking? I can&#8217;t stop myself. I devour Connie, for the rest of the evening.


Chapter 25: Helping Others

Course 8 / Day 46: 

Corinne&#8217;s mobile rings: �Corinne? It&#8217;s Larry. I&#8217;ve got some good news at last. It seems the Americans have &#8216;eliminated McEwan from their enquiries&#8217; and she&#8217;s on her way back to you. Can you tell the others?�

�Larry, that&#8217;s a relief,� Corinne responds �Yes, I&#8217;ll tell the others right now &#8211; and thank your contacts for all their help. Are we ever going to get something approaching an apology for all this turmoil?�

�Er, well I wouldn&#8217;t hold your breath. Let&#8217;s just be glad the whole things over. If anyone needs an apology it&#8217;s Mcewan.� 


Memo (Confidential)

From:  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Corinne 

To:&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jo and Charlotte

Further to my last memo: I am relieved to be able to let you know that that McEwan is on her way back. However, I&#8217;m not at all happy with the explanations we have been given. The whole thing sounds odd to me and I think that once the course is over the three of us should get together to talk about this in confidence. There&#8217;s a few things I&#8217;m unhappy about including how Larry seems to have been in the middle of all of this. Maybe we&#8217;ll know more by the time the course finishes. 


Memo

From:  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jo 
To:  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Corinne

Extremely anxious about Jenny. She was brought back late evening today by whomsoever. 

Once in her cell, she wrapped herself in her blanket and curled up in the corner facing away from the door, weeping. She was disinclined to talk and initially declined food.

I took her up to the main accommodation wing and had her fed with what we had had for dinner after which her mood lightened, but only a little. Charlotte stayed with her overnight. We may find ourselves dealing with a real psychological casualty and have to seek professional help for her. I need not labour how serious this is.

Memo

From:  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Corinne 
To:  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Larry

Here is a copy of a report about Jenny McEwan just received from Jo. Just what the hell are we going to do now? If professional help is needed for Jenny, I&nbsp; - we - will have to provide a full account of what has happened to the medical authorities and I will not know where to begin. 

Memo

From:  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Larry 
To:  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Corinne

Corinne, I know there may be some problems with McEwan. Yes, it will take her a little while to recover, but I&#8217;m confident she&#8217;ll bounce back. 

In the meantime, I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ll do everything possible to get her back on an even keel and to keep your people onside too. My recommendation is that you should return her to the regime she was under as quickly as possible. This will create a sense of reassurance with her surroundings and enable her to adjust back to the Inward Bound �normality� before attempting to return to real life.&nbsp; 

Of course, the professional psychological help will be there if we need it. I&#8217;ve got someone that I&#8216;ll get to come up and see McEwan. Keep me in touch with the situation. 

Memo

From:  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Larry
To:  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Pam Jordan &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

Pam, our former �problem� got back home day but she is quite bruised by the interrogation. I think mainly psychologically but I expect physically as well as she has been through Connie&#8217;s hands. I&#8217;m getting angry e-mails from the Inward Bound staff. Can you take a trip up here and asses the situation if McEwan is still giving concern? How long should I give it? I was thinking 24 hours max? Would that be OK? 


Jenny&#8217;s Recollections

I&#8217;m still in the Facility. Two heavies come for me. The same thick set men in dark suits and shades. I am hooded and taken out of the facility. I know only because I feel my feet on an outside surface again. No one speaks to me. I&#8217;m pushed into their van and driven off. At first all I feel is relief, each passing moment taking me away from my nightmare. Then anxiety replaces relief. What if they are not taking me to Inward Bound? What if I&#8217;m just being taken away? After an eternity we arrive somewhere else. The van stops, I am taken out, across some gravel into a building and down some stairs. We stop.
 
�Stand there, please, Ma&#8217;am,� says an American voice. My hood is pulled off and my hands un-cuffed. My eyes protest at the bright light, after the darkness on the hood and I see I am back, facing one wall of my cell, away from the door.

�We are obliged for your co-operation, Ma&#8217;am,� says the voice, to someone and then there is the sound of receding steps �

I&#8217;m overcome with relief and curl up in one corner of the cell, trying to shut out the memories of the last few days.

When I wake up, I&#8217;m in a normal bedroom. Charlotte is there, too sleeping in an easy chair. The sun is coming through the window, and I can see the flowering shrubs in the garden�

Jo comes in. �How are you now, Jenny?� she asks. �We were all so worried about you...�

�Er, �� better than I was �.I&#8217;ve still&nbsp; got this headache and I just feel exhausted �.. But, I am so glad to be back � did the men say anything? Are they still here? Are they coming back?�

 �No,� says Jo with a smile, �they are not coming back and they didn't really tell us anything. Beyond that they had warrants and that they were anxious about a security situation and ....� 

�It was terrifying, the interrogation was bad enough but there was worse they talked about selling me. Jo, I really thought that I was about to be sold into real slavery. That maybe I would just � just �.. disappear.� My voice is beginning to break up as I try to tell what happened 

�That's all right. It&#8217;s all right now.� Jo sits on the bed and puts her arm over my shoulder �Let's get you used to being back here again. Stay here for now and perhaps you could join the others later today or tomorrow. Could you manage that?�

�Yes, thanks, Jo. I would like that very much.� The more I think about it the more I want to do just that to get back to the way things are here.

�OK Look I&#8217;ll get some breakfast sent up to you and we will get you back into routine as far as you are able. Let us know straightaway if you are not managing, OK?�

�Yes, OK. Thank you, Jo.� I stand up and cuddle her with relief at being safe once again. My back is reflected in the wardrobe mirror.

Jo says, �Wow! Someone has given you a good whipping, was that � was that OK by you?�

Connie&#8217;s efforts of the evening before last are plain to see; I began and ended the scene naked and Connie wasn&#8217;t for giving me any clothes back again. It seems she likes her work to get a public showing whenever possible.

The memory of Connie comes back in full force: a cocktail of terror and erotic desire, but I manage a smile and, bringing myself back to my position as a slave, say �Yes, Mistress, Thank you, Mistress. Thank you.�

By the time lunch has come and gone and I have been given permission to go down into the gardens, but Jo, or Charlotte, Celia, Gerry or George seem never to be far away.

As for me, I am feeling just enormous relief to be back in familiar surroundings, comforted by the familiar �beep� as my RFID chip is registered by a sensor on the building systems again. 

I'm ashamed to admit that I had completely forgotten about Angela. I wonder for a moment if it all hadn&#8217;t been some form of roller coaster ride organised by Inward Bound. But Angela would never have gone along with that would she? And Jo seemed genuinely confused and upset by it. And, it all seemed so real. I mean, I had seen Connie at the garden party. Does that mean she was involved with Inward Bound, or did it just mean that she was part of some surveillance team? It's all so confusing &#8211; maybe while I've been here I've lost my ability to think straight.

The Inward Bound people do everything to make me feel at home again, gradually I start to feel better. As far as I can manage. Eventually, I'm back in my old cell, and Ylena comes to the cell to examine me, and pretends to be outraged that I have been beaten by someone else. But then, she admires the marks of Connie&#8217;s whip and tells me that I can most certainly expect another caning shortly. Gerry comes by, shaves my head again and gives my scalp a massage with some soothing moisturiser. Celia drops by to check my piercings and Jonathan looks in on me to tell me that I am due for some more work on my tattoo soon, but only when I feel I can cope with it.

At last, Jo gives me my work assignments - more gardening, cleaning in her suite and work in the kitchens. I'm not going to have the chance to get bored. It feels as though I am where I am meant to be. When I lay down on my bed, I look up at the blinking red light of the CCTV camera. It almost feels like a friend. I am asleep almost at once.

At breakfast, the other girls are all anxious to know where I'd been and what had happened to me but Jo tells them all that they are not to quiz me about it. She warns that any idle gossip about things that may or may not have gone on outside the centre will incur substantial demerits. That certainly seems to dampen down their curiosity and, since I am pretty certain that demerits will be passed my way too, it serves to discourage me from talking about it, too. Not that I want to pick at recent painful wounds.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

It's Jo that comes to see me after breakfast. �How are you now, Fifty?� she asks. I go to get up, but she tells me to stay put. 

�I&#8217;m fine, thank you, Mistress,� I say.

�Good,� she says. �Are you ready to pick up where you left off?�

�Yes,� I say, surprising myself with my willingness. �Yes, I am.�&nbsp; And, in a curious way,&nbsp; I now feel ready for anything.

�Very well,� says Jo. �You&#8217;d better come with me.� She smiles a sly smile �..


Jo clips a leash to my nose ring and leads me through the centre. I follow, as I must. She stops to talk to Charlotte at one point. I wait silently, head bowed, hands clasped behind my back while they talk of some session, or other, that they have planned for Carrie and Sue. Neither Jo nor Charlotte even mentions me. Their conversation is soon finished and Jo sets off again with me in tow.

She takes me to Ylena&#8217;s room. I&#8217;m glad but, even so, I&#8217;m caught between a confused desire to see Ylena again and the dread of a further round of punishment after my experiences with Connie.

Jo leads me through into the adjoining room with its scarlet wall coverings and pale blue carpet. 

There is a small box on the floor. It&#8217;s got various jars and bottles and clothes in it.

�Work time, Fifty,� Jo announces. �Mistress Ylena needs to use this room later, but the equipment needs cleaning. You can make yourself useful with this.� She points to the box. �You&#8217;ll find saddle soap for the leather and polish for the wooden racks that the punishment tools are stacked in. Don&#8217;t use very much, just enough to take the dust off and shine them up. On the side over there,� she points to a small white trolley, �are Ylena&#8217;s electrical toys. They need to be cleaned with an antiseptic wipe. So do the whips and canes and any of the straps and cuffs that fasten around the body. The insertable toys have all been sterilized by Mistress Ylena and bagged with the number of the slave they are used on, so it&#8217;s essential you do not open the bags or break the seals.�

I stand nodding as she explains the task.

�Do you understand what need to be done?� Jo asks.

�Yes, Mistress,� I reply and she leaves me. I start on my work, taking the whips, canes and floggers down from their rack first of all. There is a table on one side of the room and I lay them out neatly there. That way I&#8217;ll be able to keep track of which ones I have cleaned and which are left to do and make sure that I put them back in the same place that they have come from.

I clean the wooden racks. The polish smells sweet and scented. The racks aren&#8217;t very dusty but I try to be as thorough as I can be. I know that if Ylena were to use her canes on me, the last thing I would want was dust and dirt being crushed into a wound by the blow of one of them. 

I finish the racks and start to clean off the canes, wiping each of them with an antiseptic wipe before returning them to their place, trying to remember exactly where each has come from. As I am doing it, I&#8217;m suddenly aware of how relaxed I feel. This simple task with the simple precision it requires is absorbing all of my attention, and I have already nearly forgotten the psychological pain of recent days. I&#8217;m feeling pleased with myself when I hear Ylena&#8217;s voice outside.

She appears in the room looking very firm and determined. Judy is following her with a smirk on her face. She looks at me in a way that I&#8217;ve come to expect from the staff at Inward Bound, but certainly not from the other slaves. I&#8217;m worried because she certainly took pleasure from ordering me about when I was told to please her before.

Ylena sees me. �Ah, Fifty! Moi slooga is back.�

I smile, pleased by her acknowledgement of my status. �Da, Gaspazha,� I say. 

Ylena says. �Have you cleaned all my toys?�

�Da Gaspazha,� I reply pointing proudly to the rack.

Ylena peers at it and seems to approve. She turns back to Judy. �Tell Fifty why you are here, Nineteen.�

�Corporal punishment, Gaspazha,� Judy says with a gleam in her eye.� Her use of Ylena&#8217;s title rekindles old jealousies. She&#8217;s my Gaspazha. I am her slooga, vash slooga, I say to myself, watching in dismay as the brightness in Ylena&#8217;s eyes tells me that she takes as much pleasure in punishing Judy as she ever had me. But Judy&#8217;s next words give me a shock, �It&#8217;s for a corporal punishment session with Number Fifty.� She sounds like she is looking forward to taking a cane to my backside.

�Very good, Nineteen,� Ylena says. �How do you feel about that, Fifty?�

The truth is that I&#8217;m not very happy with the idea. I suppose that if Ylena is ordering Judy to beat me, it&#8217;s just the same as if she is doing it herself, but somehow it seems wrong to be being beaten by another slave. �If that is what you wish, Gaspazha,� I say, uncertainly.

Ylena smiles with approval. �Good answer, Fifty,� she says. �Good answer.�

�And you, Nineteen, how do you feel?�

�What ever you wish, Gaspazha,� she says, taking her cue from me, but a self satisfied little smile is playing across her lips... 

�Very good,� says Ylena. �In which case we can begin.� She picks up one of the chains that she uses as a leash. I&#8217;m expecting her to clip it to my collar but instead she turns on her heel fastens the chain to Judy&#8217;s collar and pulls her towards her. �You, slave,� she says firmly, �have still to learn some important lessons.�

Judy is obviously started by the change of events. �Please, I&#8217;ve done nothing to deserve punishment,� Judy pleads.

�Do you think so?� Ylena says. She turns to me and orders, �Fifty, you will help me deal with this!�&nbsp; Ylena twists Judy&#8217;s chain in her hand until Judy&#8217;s face is brought up against Ylena&#8217;s fist. She simply rolls her arm over and Judy is forced to her knees at Ylena&#8217;s feet. Ylena turns back towards me. �Make the horse ready for her,� she says. 

I am slow to respond. Of course I know I must obey Ylena but I don&#8217;t like the idea that I am helping her to punish one of the other slaves. Ylena stills any objections I might have with a look and I set to unfastening the straps from the back and the legs of the horse. As soon as she sees that I have finished she has Judy get up from the floor and sends her smartly across to the spanking horse. �Strap her down,� Ylena orders. Then, without waiting to see if I am doing as she asks, she walks across, peers at the rack of whips and floggers and then goes out into the other room.

As she leaves, Judy begs me to help her. �It wasn&#8217;t my fault. I didn&#8217;t mean to seem disrespectful. Do we have to do this? Can&#8217;t you speak to Gaspazha?�

�You know I can&#8217;t do anything,� I say. �She&#8217;ll be back in a moment and she&#8217;ll want to see you secured. I&#8217;m sorry, but I have to. You must see that.�

Judy looks at me as though she doesn&#8217;t see anything of the sort. But she stretches herself out across the horse, reaching down with her arms to let me fasten her wrists to the legs of the horse and stretching her legs to allow me to do the same with her ankles. �All right,� she says reluctantly. I can tell she thinks I&#8217;m betraying her even though moments ago she was enjoying the prospect of my squirming under the cane that she would be applying.

I&#8217;m fastening the broad belt that goes across her lower back and fixing her helplessly to the horse when Ylena returns. I&#8217;m annoyed that Judy can&#8217;t see that I&#8217;ve got no choice. I pull the belt a bit tighter than is probably absolutely necessary. Judy grunts as I do so just as Ylena returns.

Ylena has changed out of the rather conventional blouse and skirt that she was wearing when she brought Judy in. Now she&#8217;s wearing a skin-tight, high-necked, black top, a pair of black leggings and high-heeled boots. She pulls on leather, fingerless gloves as she comes into the room. Her stern gaze is sufficient to reduce me to jelly. Judy cannot see her. Ylena says nothing. She gestures for me to stand beside the wooden rack and then walks around the horse checking that Judy is well secured and that the straps that hold her are tightly fastened. She stands up and grunts her approval. �Spaseeba, moi slooga,� she says. In spite of the fact that my efforts mean Judy is now helpless, I feel quite pleased with myself. Ylena gestures to a cabinet on the other side of the room. �Fetch a gag,� she says. �This needs to be kept quiet.�

I go across to the cabinet and open the drawer. It&#8217;s filled with an array of gags from balls in a range of sizes threaded onto straps to padded mufflers and rubber bar gags. Ylena isn&#8217;t giving me any clues as to the type that she wants. I pick one. It&#8217;s a bright red ball gag. I take it out of the drawer and offer it to Ylena.

�Oh,� she says with approval. �A cruel slooga.� She takes it from me and fits it onto Judy. It&#8217;s quite large for her. Probably larger than I had realised. Judy groans. I hadn&#8217;t meant to be cruel.&nbsp; 

Ylena looks pleased with the effect of the gag, stroking the back of Judy&#8217;s head as she whimpers from the discomfort of mouth filling ball. She runs her hands down to Judy&#8217;s buttocks, �This needs attention,� she says, not really to Judy, not really to me. �To improve its behaviour. To increase its respect.� Eventually, she turns back to me. �Pass me one,� she points to the rack.

I&#8217;m confused. I don&#8217;t understand which of the many floggers, whips and canes she wants. �I&#8217;m sorry, Gaspazha,� I say. �Which did you want?�

�You choose, moi slooga, you choose.� Judy gives a muffled squeak of protest. Ylena lays a single finger on the top of Judy&#8217;s head to indicate she should be quiet.

I don&#8217;t know what to do. I hesitate. Of course Ylena can simply walk across here and pick up whichever whip or cane she chooses. If I choose it makes no difference to the punishment that Judy will receive but if I do chose Judy will see me as complicit in her punishment. 

�Come on, make your choice,� Ylena insists quietly, looking straight at me. I know that she won&#8217;t threaten me and that when she says &#8216;make your choice&#8217; she doesn&#8217;t just mean from the rack. I blush with shame, knowing that I can&#8217;t disobey her. I select a leather tawse from the rack. It&#8217;s what I would choose for Ylena, if she asked me what she should beat me with. That seems the fairest thing I can do. I walk across to Ylena, kneel beside her and offer the tawse to her.

�Spaseeba, slooga,� she says as she takes the tawse from my outstretched hands. Judy growls. �Stay there and watch closely.�

�Da, Gaspazha,� I say. In an attempt to make my peace with Judy I say, �Gaspazha, could you beat me instead of Number Nineteen?�

Ylena smiles. �Nyet, slooga, nyet. That would not be right. This slave is due for punishment and so, she must be punished. And besides, I know that you take pleasure from your beatings, so it is hardly a penance is it?�

I blush with embarrassment.

�No, this must be dealt with.� She takes her arm back and lays a heavy blow across Judy&#8217;s back side. Judy yelps into her gag and turns her head to scowl at me. More blows follow, the tawse flicking down inches from my face, as I kneel beside the horse.

After perhaps a dozen strokes, Ylena pauses. 

�Now, Nineteen brought you to see me for our first meeting and she fondled you and took advantage of you, before you changed your Profile to accept that��.. Ylena leans down and whispers into my Judy&#8217;s ear � �didn&#8217;t she?�

�Yes, but I really did not mind,� I reply.

�That&#8217;s not the point, �continues Ylena. �What happens to slaves depends on their behaviour and the decisions they make. Nineteen acted without authority and it is time she paid &#8211; to help her be better next time, whatever her pussy tells her!�

She turns to me and holds the tawse out. I take it from her, expecting her to ask me for another implement from the rack. I&#8217;m wrong. �Now, you have learned about the power of pain. Show me that you can apply it.�

I&#8217;m taken aback. She can&#8217;t want me to beat Judy. That&#8217;s not right. I&#8217;m a submissive. Submissives don&#8217;t beat people. 

Ylena understands, of course, what she is asking of me. �Come, slooga, you have the tawse in your hand. Get to your feet and come here.� I look up at her begging with my eyes for her not to make me do it. Her quiet smile lets me know that there is no possibility that she will allow me to avoid this duty. She reaches out with one hand, the leather of her glove brushes against my cheek. �I know, I know,� she says. �Sometimes it is hard to be a slave.� She helps me to my feet and leads me gently to where she was standing at the back of the horse. Judy is struggling against her straps and squealing more loudly in her gag but all I can do is to stare at Ylena&#8217;s calm and smiling face. She points to Judy&#8217;s buttocks. �Let the blows fall here,� she says, �and here,� pointing to areas where her own work has not yet reddened the flesh.

�As you say, Gaspazha,� I say taking up the same stance that Ylena had taken before.

�I do,� she says. �And you,� she turns to speak again to Judy, �you should know that this is because you disobeyed the rules.�

Judy gives a quizzical grunt through her gag.

�Some time ago, number Nineteen, you were told to bring Fifty here to my room. When you did so, you were seen touching her sexually. You knew that you were not allowed sexual contact with another slave unless explicitly directed. You should know, too, that your every move is observed. Now you will be punished and number Fifty will carry out the punishment. Such delightful symmetry�&nbsp;&nbsp; 

Until Ylena mentioned, it I had forgotten all about the episode but she is right. I was standing hooded and helpless outside Ylena&#8217;s room. Judy had led me there. She must have been seen on the CCTV camera. Even so, it hardly seems fair for me to punish Judy now. 

 �Begin!� Judy is shaking her head and trying to shout through her gag. Ylena ignores her and urges me on. �Please, begin,� she says. I am staring at her. �I said begin. It&#8217;s necessary that you begin.� 

I lift the tawse. I&#8216;m staring at her. My brain and my body are working on different channels. I&#8217;m aware of my arm coming down and the tawse striking Judy&#8217;s buttocks but I&#8217;m not thinking about it. What I am thinking about is the Milgram Experiment. Ordinary people. Doing what they were told. Causing pain. Even apparently killing someone. Just because somebody told them to. The tawse comes down again. Judy lurches against the horse. Ylena is looking on with approval. The tawse comes down again. Judy squeals. I pause. Ylena says, �You have to continue.�

And I do. I&#8217;m sweating with the effort. Judy&#8217;s backside is red, swollen, and welted in places where I have failed to land the straps cleanly. I find myself watching the tawse come down, trying to think what I must do with my wrist, with my arm. And I realise that Judy is sobbing with the discomfort and humiliation of my punishing her for taking sexual advantage of me and that Ylena has said nothing more. And she hasn&#8217;t said anything except that I should do it. 

And I do.

And I enjoy it. Connie appears again in my mind: �It&#8217;s different when you are on the other side isn&#8217;t it?� she reminds me, smiling like a predator who still has me in her grip �

I&#8217;m suddenly horrified by what I&#8217;ve done. I drop the tawse and put my hands to my mouth. Ylena comes across and takes me in her arms. �It&#8217;s going to be all right, moi slooga,� she says. �Trust me to make it right.� Ylena tells me to release Judy from the horse. I unfasten the buckles on her straps. She climbs unsteadily to the floor and immediately makes to rub her bottom. 

Ylena reaches down and fastens one end of a leash to Judy&#8217;s collar and the other end to a hook on the wall. She goes across to her computer and taps on a few keys. She turns back to me. �Now, moi slooga. I shall make it right with you two. The horse. Now it is your turn to lie down!�

Of course I obey and as I position myself, I hear her say to Judy; � Nineteen, strap her down for me.�

�Da, Gaspazha,� Judy replies and soon has me helplessly restrained. So at least Judy will have the pleasure of seeing me beaten by Gaspazha, I think. 

But what Gaspazha says is, �Now Fifty and Nineteen. Slaves must be obedient and trust their owners. They must sometimes learn technical skills, as well as menial tasks. Today, Fifty began to learn how to give punishment and now it&#8217;s the turn of Nineteen. And, I am sure, Nineteen will enjoy her lesson! Hmmm?� Gaspazha leans down to me and whispers, �There, I said it would be all right, did I not?�

I glance up and catch sight of Judy with a broad grin on her face!

�Now, Nineteen. Fifty will say &#8216;thank you&#8217; for each stroke you give her. What would you like to begin with? The tawse perhaps? Perhaps this one &#8211; it&#8217;s heavier than the tawse you tasted but easier to control. Strike there &#8211; and there.�

My ordeal at the business end of Judy&#8217;s tawse takes quite a while. Ylena is very picky when it comes to technique and any stroke she is not happy with has to be repeated and all through I am careful to thank Judy for her efforts. Each blow cuts me and brings a gasp from my lips. I feel the cumulative effects of the pain. Each new blow seems to push me on, as though I am being driven up a flight of stairs. Each pause lets me slip back. Two up, One down. The pain climbing as my mind climbs the staircase. It goes on for some time. I am lost under the spell of the situation. I&#8217;m not struggling, just flexing my body. It&#8217;s almost as though I am trying to position my self so that she should strike me to best effect. I&#8217;ve lost myself in the waves of pain. And I&#8217;m helping my Gaspazha, I feel. Helping her educate another slave and suffering so deliciously!

�Enough!� says Ylena. �You will finish your tutorial with the cane! Now, take this one. Tell me about it.�

�Well, Gaspazha� begins Judy, �It&#8217;s very light�.

�Da! Moi slooga. It&#8217;s a thin cane. It will leave beautiful marks &#8211; in fact it probably leaves the best marks - and it feels bright and stingy. It&#8217;s a good cane to start with. Your mistakes will not be as bad for Fifty as they might be with the heavier cane. Aim for here then move slowly down to here. Try not to hit the same place twice. You should try to have the cane create pain and beauty at the same time. Don&#8217;t hurry!&nbsp; Strive to swing level in measured, parallel strokes. Begin!�

I am sweating profusely as Judy begins. Her strokes are not as accomplished as Ylena&#8217;s. But they sting just as bad. Ylena usually tells me how many I&#8217;m to receive. This time there is no such re-assuring target set and I am beginning to really feel sore.

�One &#8211; thank you, Nineteen.

�Two &#8211; ah! Thank you Nineteen

�Three &#8211; AHHH, thank you Ninettt �

�Four &#8211; thank&nbsp; AAHH AAHH thank you (I am gasping now and squeezing my buttocks to try and make the stinging go away) N - n - nineteen.�

�Now Nineteen. Saw the cane back and forward across her bum. MMMM like that. Give her a little recovery time. Actually this will allow her to enjoy her last two strokes. Now!�

�AAAAHHHH AAAAHHHH, thank&nbsp; thank you Nineteen.�

�Now, Nineteen. This will end your lesson &#8211; for today. A final cut. Aim here. Nice and firm. Full control. Keep your wrist straight. Now.�

I can hear Judy&#8217;s last stroke coming, hissing towards me. And then it lands, burning a hot track across my buttocks. I buck and writhe in the straps of the spanking horse&nbsp; 

�AAAAAHH AAAAAHHHH AAHH, thank you Nineteen.�

�Enough!� pronounces Ylena. �You have both done well. I think number Nineteen is quite gifted at giving CP. We shall develop this talent. And next time, Nineteen, you shall have another opportunity to learn more about the cane from the victim&#8217;s point of view before I train you on another of your colleagues�.

�Release her!�

Ylena turns to her laptop once more as Judy unstraps me.

�Now, slooga Fifty and slooga Nineteen. Go straight back to your cells. The doors will recognise you both.�
 
And, of course, Ylena is right. The locks on the doors open, programmed to recognise our chips.&nbsp; Judy goes into her cell and I pass further down the corridor to my own where I crawl on all fours across to my bed and collapse on it face down. My bum burns. After all within fourty eight hours it&#8217;s been whipped by Connie and thoroughly spanked by Judy. Welcome back! 


Chapter 26: I&#8217;ve Got You Under My Skin

MEMO (Confidential)

From:  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jo and Charlotte 
To: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Corinne

Charlotte and I agree: we have to talk through this business. The good news is that Fifty seems to be coming round, so to speak, with no sign of damaging after effects. One thing bothering us is that no one can have failed to notice the whip marks on her back, bum and legs. This does not look like some ham fisted interrogation beating. It looks exactly as though it has been done with erotic intent. Ylena would have been proud of it. If the Authorities are at the bottom of this business, it&#8217;s not only outrageous but it&#8217;s grotesque as well. If you combine that with everything else then we both share your suspicions of Larry and the explanations he has offered.


Course 8 / Day 47: Course Progress Meeting

Participant Notes: Fifty

Jo: Observation of Fifty overnight confirms that she found yesterday&#8217;s sessions particularly challenging. Her recent experiences have been very traumatic for her and she has found confronting her feelings about administering punishment distressing. Actions for today include further work on Fifty&#8217;s tattoo.

Jenny's Recollections:

I had a dreadful night. Tossing. Turning. Fretting about yesterday. It&#8217;s not often since I&#8217;ve been here that I haven&#8217;t slept well. Which is odd given all that&#8217;s happened. I finally manage to get to sleep but it seems like its only moments before the lights come on again and the shutters on my cell go up.

It&#8217;s the morning. Charlotte comes for me. She clips a lead to my nose ring and I silently follow. I pass by Judy&#8217;s cell. She&#8217;s on her knees obviously waiting for someone to come for her. I can&#8217;t bring myself to look her in the face, because even though I was richly paid back by Judy for my efforts, I still feel uncomfortable about punishing a fellow slave. Nevertheless, this is part of our education, Judy and me
 
Pretty soon, I realise that we are going to the medical room, which means Celia or Jonathan or both of them at once, I suppose. I&#8217;m not sure how well I will cope with this. I still feel tired. 

She swipes her key card through the door lock and we are greeted by Jonathan.

Well, I say �we are greeted�, actually Jonathan only speaks to Charlotte. �Hi, Charlotte. Great to see you. I see you&#8217;ve brought Fifty for her next session.�

I guess that they must have arranged this before hand. I realise that I have become used to being spoken about as though my feelings or concerns were not important. Or actually, now I come to think about it, being spoken about as if I were not even there.

Charlotte smiles and nods. Jonathan carries on talking to her. �OK Charlotte,� he says. �just to keep you informed of what&#8217;s going on... Today I am going to carry on with the in-filling of the design. I won&#8217;t be able to finish it, though. It&#8217;s quite a large design.�

I know. I think, it&#8217;s a lot larger than I thought it was going to be, but of course he&#8217;s not talking to me.

�Actually, there is too much to do in the time that Fifty is here with us. I shall have to see Fifty in my Studio in another month or so. I guess that will be all right with you, Charlotte?�

All right with you?? All right with Charlotte? What about me ? It&#8217;s me that&#8217;s getting the tattoo.&nbsp; It&#8217;s my back! I can hardly believe that I thought that. After all this time. Of course, I&#8217;m a slave and I&#8217;m having this done to me to please Charlotte. At least I guess that it&#8217;s to please Charlotte. Or is it that Charlotte thinks it will please me, eventually? Or is it that they just think that it&#8217;s good for slaves to have them submit to being marked? Or?

My thoughts are interrupted. Charlotte responds to Jonathan. �Sure. There&#8217;ll be no problem with that. Come along, Fifty.� 

Charlotte leads me over to the plinth and I lay on it, face down, obediently, like an offering on an altar. Finally Jonathan speaks to me as he arranges his needles in their sterile packs and sets out his inks, getting ready for the task. �So, Fifty how are you today?�

�I&#8217;m good, thank you, Sir,� I reply.&nbsp; As I speak it sounds almost robotic. It&#8217;s a curious response, almost automatic, answering with what I know he wants to hear rather than actually saying what I feel. It&#8217;s not an exchange between two equals. I&#8217;m not even sure it feels like an exchange between two human beings. It sounds like that special way a friend of mine talks to her cat. And Jonathan is taking less notice of my reply than she does of the cat&#8217;s purrs and meows. Am I still human? Have I become some sort of �other�? Is that what being a slave does to you? That you adapt to the way you are treated and your status as a slave hardens around you like a new skin? Actually, they don&#8217;t stop my asking what&#8217;s going on. I do it to myself, I realise. Time to re-assert my humanity, I think. Time to re-engage my ego, even if I make my response in the respectful tone that is expected of me. �May I ask what you are going to do today, Sir?�

Charlotte and Jonathan both start to reply and say different things. I start to giggle. We all dissolve into laughter. It breaks the tension. Suddenly, I feel a lot better.

�OK, I&#8217;ll go first,� says Jonathan, taking charge. I hear him snap on a pair of latex gloves. He is running his fingers gently across my back as though he is tracing the areas he is going to work on. 

He helps me to stretch out on the plinth. �How are you feeling about this?� he asks.

�Good,� I say nodding with a smile. �The other girls are jealous.�

�And so they should be, young lady. Your back is just the perfect canvas for this. You ready for some more?�

I nod again. He starts to sponge my skin and lays down some Vaseline over the area he will work on.. �This time, Fifty, we start to fill in some of the detail. I won&#8217;t do too much but we&#8217;ll try to fill in here,� I feel him touch me just below the shoulder blade, �and here,� he touches me again, this time just around where he&#8217;d put the barcode, �I want to put some decoration around this. Look, you can watch.� He points to a mirror just in front of me. It&#8217;s angled so that I can see another mirror. In it, there is my back with the design outline spread across it.

The tattooing process is still a bit scary. Perhaps if it had been my idea in the first place or if Joe had asked me to get it done, it would be something I would be looking forward to with delicious anticipation. As it is, it&#8217;s all mixed up with learning to trust someone else &#8211; my owners - to have my best interests at heart.

�I&#8217;m going to do some of the filling in on the areas where we need blocks of colour,� says Jonathon. �This will be a bit faster than what I&#8217;ve done so far, because I will be using a larger needle, but I&#8217;ll be covering a larger area.� The apprehension is obviously showing in my face, because Jonathan continues, �But, its OK, Fifty, it will not feel any worse than the last bit, really.You heard me say to Charlotte that I don&#8217;t think we can realistically have everything finished before you return home, so I will see you again on my home ground. My studio is in London. Will that be a problem?�

I find it difficult to think about things after I leave here. Will that be a problem? I don&#8217;t know. I&#8217;m so used now to not making decisions. Why is he asking me to make a decision like that? Suddenly, I feel it&#8217;s all getting too much. Then I get a grip of myself. �No Sir,� I reply. �I will be able to manage London. It won&#8217;t be a problem.� Thinking about things after being here raises another question. �Erm, Joe &#8211; that&#8217;s my husband - might well want to come. Will that be OK with you?�

�Of course. It&#8217;s fine by me but, well, I guess it depends on what he thinks about what you have been up to!�

Yes, it does and, for the first time in quite long time, I start to think seriously about what Joe actually will think. After all there is a limit to everyone&#8217;s credulity and there is only just so much that I can reasonably explain under the heading of �selfless devotion to research�.&nbsp; 

�So,� Charlotte takes up the conversation, �as you will not be going anywhere for an hour or two� �

�Or three!� chips in Jonathan. My anxiety levels start to rise again.

Charlotte continues, ��. I thought this would be a good time to have you tell me how you thought you have progressed and if your IWB experience has been good for you.�

She&#8217;s sounds the way the Prof does when she quizzes me on work I&#8217;ve been doing but this is very different. There&#8217;s no question in my mind about whether she has any right to know how I feel. No question of trying to keep my thoughts and feelings private. �Yes, of course,&nbsp; Mistress,� I say. I&#8217;m almost surprised at myself. Goodness, how easily the right response for a slave comes to me now and how correct it sounds. I&#8217;m not sure how I&#8217;ll get on when I&#8217;m no longer here. I&#8217;m damned if I&#8217;m going to talk this way to Angela, though, much as she would enjoy hearing it from me!

�Exactly, so let&#8217;s begin. Well, not quite begin. First �� Charlotte sits on a low stool and slips her feet out of her flip flops and puts them to one side. She lifts her feet and placing them on the plinth right in front of my face.&nbsp; I remember the beautiful cowboy boots she was wearing when we first met. I can still see the stitching and the decorative punching in my mind&#8217;s eye. The sandals are just as nice as the boots were. I try to think if I have seen similar in the shops, but I don&#8217;t think so. She must have them made up specially. Hmmm. Money well spent. Her sandals are perfectly shaped to fit. The soles are nice and thick, but also look soft to walk on. The thongs are just a touch wider than you would see on sandals in the shops. Perfect.

I see her flex her toes. It is clear what she wants. It&#8217;s what I want, too. I start to nuzzle, kiss and lick her feet, just as I did that time before. Once more, they are warm and have a lovely leathery smell. She has rubbed in some sort of skin conditioner, which adds to the delicious sensation and gives her feet a slightly pepperminty flavour.

Meanwhile, Jonathan has begun again. There is the buzz of his tattooing handpiece and a sharp sting as he starts work, but with tattooing the sting just goes on. I try to breath through the sensation, which interrupts my work on Charlotte&#8217;s feet. I look up. She smiles, and motions me to continue, which I do as soon as I can. That&#8217;s not as soon as I would like, because Jonathan&#8217;s attentions are taking up quite a bit of my mind.

�So Fifty: have you enjoyed your time with us?� Charlotte ignores what&#8217;s going on at my back and what I&#8217;m doing to her feet. 

�Yes, Ma&#8217;am �..I �.. I&#8217;m very glad I ��� came.� There are pauses as the pressures and stings at my back change.

�Enjoyed every aspect?�

�Well, ah �ha � ha �. Maybe � not every � aspect ��

�So what has been toughest?�

�Being arrested and � ha � Ha � aaaaahh � interrogated. And there was this woman��

�Was that Connie? You were sleep talking when you got back and kept calling out the name.�

�Ye �.ye �..&nbsp; yes. Co�.. Connie,� Jonathan has found a sensitive area. It&#8217;s hard to break my mind away from what&#8217;s going on behind me, hard to keep up the conversation.

�So what was she like?�

�Well, you know those pictures of how � how � How � Stars bend space-time because they have so much gravity?� The tattooing is not so bad here. My words all just tumble out as if they want to be said before things change and speech becomes hard going again. �Well, Connie is a bit like that except with her it&#8217;s emotional gravity.�

�Hmmm, scary!�

�Well �.aha �. Aha �. Yes.&nbsp; But I guess I also kept getting hot for her, too �..�

�Hot!�

�Well, yes, I&#8217;m sorry. I was just saying how I felt at the time.�

�No, don&#8217;t apologise Fifty. You have to be honest. That&#8217;s very interesting. So if she were here now and wanted to take you away somewhere, would you go?�

I&#8216;m worried about where this is leading. I feel myself tense. I sense Jonathan feels it too. He stops working for a moment. Even though I&#8217;m concerned, I can&#8217;t help the answer. �Er, er well, yes, I might want to go.�

�So suppose she said she wanted you to go be someone&#8217;s slave, maybe for quite a long time, what would you say?�

�Not her slave? Oh, er � well, er �.. I guess part of me would want to do it for her but mainly, �&nbsp; I mean I was attracted to her �. her&nbsp; �.. emotional power.�

�So it was really her?�

�Yes, I&#8217;m sorry. It was her.�

�No don&#8217;t be sorry. You are just telling me how you felt. And what else about Inward Bound?�

�Well, there is so much else. I will have to think carefully back on it all ��

�This is your research?� Charlotte has a sly smile on her face, as if to say, �And, just remember what trouble it got you into.�

I catch myself hoping that Angela has had a some taste of what I&#8217;ve been going through when she was left in Connie&#8217;s capable hands �

�Well, yes but I&#8217;m sure anyone would feel the same. There are just so many things I&#8217;ve done that I would not have had the courage to do otherwise ��

�You&#8217;ve done?�

�Well, I mean, things I have experienced. Mostly it has been things that were done to me, of course. Although I allowed it. I stayed here. I could have gone.� And I wonder to myself could I? I mean, yes, they would have let me go but could I have gone?

�Would you have been brave enough to do them for yourself? To find all this for yourself?�

�No, Mistress, I guess not.� I know that I couldn&#8217;t. Some of it, yes. But the tattooing? The beating?&nbsp; The shaving? The piercing? The sheer terror of the abduction and the interrogation? The sex? Well, maybe the sex!

�So, you are glad we pushed you just a little?�

Just a little? More than a little, I think, but I say, �Yes, Ma&#8217;am. I&#8217;m very grateful that you pushed me hard.�

�Hard?�

�Yes, Ma&#8217;am. Hard.�&nbsp; And, I smile. 

And she smiles back at me. And, at that point, I really am glad. The shaving. The piercings, The spankings, The tattooing ouch! Yes, even the tattooing!

�But your job? That must need quite a lot of initiative &#8211; you must have to work on your own. And then I suppose you must have teaching to do? That must need self-confidence �?�

�Yes, that&#8217;s a good summary, Ma&#8217;am.�

�So, was it difficult to put that all to one side?�

I think about what she&#8217;s saying. I haven&#8217;t really been conscious of &#8216;putting things to one side&#8217; it&#8217;s just how things have happened. Once I&#8217;d taken that first step. It&#8217;s like getting on a slide. You can&#8217;t decide half way down that you won&#8217;t go the rest of the way. Charlotte is looking down at me. I kiss her feet again but I know that I am going to have to answer. �Well, �er �.er, I think coming � here,� Jonathan has started work again. �Uhh�needed a sort of self confidence, but at the beginning � well, ..er � I mu� must say I did�I did�..think.. I was crazy�to come at all.�

�And, what will Joe say when you get back?�

That&#8217;s a question that pricks me like Jonathan&#8217;s needles. What will Joe say? The sensation on my back right now is a hot vibrating spot about a centimetre in diameter. Well, that&#8217;s what it feels like. It really is quite sore. I am squeezing my hands together and breathing out slowly and carefully. The result of all this will be beautiful, but the process really is quite tough. And what will Joe say?

AHHHH: I am breathing heavily now and conversation with Charlotte becomes impossible. If I concentrate on the pain of the tattooing I can just about breathe in a controlled way but if I am distracted by talking, the pain seems to slip out of control.

Jonathan senses I am just about all in and calls a halt.

�Well done, Fifty!� he says. �That will do for now.�

�I&#8217;m sorry Sir. I feel like a complete wimp.�

�No, not at all. You are having a huge tattoo done and backs are just sore.�

�It&#8217;s funny, but when I have been whipped and spanked, the pain was quite different �.�

�Yes, it&#8217;s very different. Different circumstances. Different tools. Different operation, if you will. Anyway, I think you have done very well and I think we should call it a day for now. Here: get up. As long as Mistress Charlotte over there is happy that her feet have been adequately cared for.�

Charlotte smiles. �Oh yes,� she says. �You are quite good at feet, aren&#8217;t you, Fifty?�

The way she says it, it&#8217;s almost like she thinks I enjoy it. Which of course I do. I blush. I climb a shade unsteadily from the plinth and notice I am shaking although the room is really quite warm. Jonathan wraps cling film over the area he has been working on, fixing it with micropore tape.

There,� he says, �at least that should stop your being beaten for a few days.�

�You&#8217;ll have to cover a lot more of my body to stop Ylena from finding a spot that she can spank,� I say with a smile. How on earth can I joke about that? I don&#8217;t know but I can. 

��Hmmm. Yes, but there will be plenty left and in any case, I have left Ylena&#8217;s prime areas untouched so she does not have to make any compromises,� Jonathan winks, as he says this and I chuckle in response. �Same general instructions as before, Fifty. Take off the cling film in the shower. Wash very carefully with some mild soap and pat dry. Your skin will feel rather rougher than last time. The area will scab over and in a week, or so, it will start to itch as the scab separates. NO SCRATCHING. Understand?�

�No Sir, I mean, yes, Sir!�

�Perhaps Charlotte or Jo will be able to put some skin cream on for you? Or have one of the other slaves do for you. After all we artists expect our canvas to be properly cared for!�

�Hmmm,� says Charlotte, �I&#8217;m sure we can manage that.� She&nbsp; raises an eyebrow towards Jonathan as if to say �Don&#8217;t nag!�

I wonder if Jonathan has a bit of the Prima Donna about him? Still, it&#8217;s good to feel I really am being properly looked after. During this last few minutes Charlotte has made tea &#8211; even for me - and the tea is just wonderful. We sit together and drink it from delicate china bowls. The tea&nbsp; is served without milk. Charlotte and Jonathan chatting; I&#8217;m happy to sit quietly. 

It&#8217;s almost normal until Charlotte picks up my leash and clips it to my nose ring. �Come along,� she says, as she slips her feet back into her sandals. 

A little while later, I am being led by Charlotte back towards my cell.

�Can we continue the debrief another day, please, Ma&#8217;am?� I ask, �It&#8217;s just that I&#8217;m all in now.�

�Yes, Fifty. That&#8217;s a good idea. I think you were wrestling with what your husband was going to say.�

�Yes, Ma&#8217;am,� I reply. �It&#8217;s not an easy call to make. Can I have my evening meal and sleep on it?�

�Yes, you may. Might be less of a problem than sleeping on your back?�

And she smiles. And I smile too. It&#8217;s been a good day. In my cell I lay down on my tummy. I&#8217;m asleep almost at once.


Chapter 27: Seeking Perfection

Course 8 / Day 48: Course Progress Meeting

Participant Notes: Fifty

Jo: My aim with Fifty was that on her return she should be reintegrated into the course as quickly as possible. There are still eight days before she completes the course and the time needs to be used effectively to minimise any detrimental impact of the �rendition� fiasco as far as possible. Anyway it is time for her to try to put what she has learned into practice in a more integrated way. 


Jenny&#8217;s Recollections


It&#8217;s morning. The shutters go up on my cell. Things are refreshingly normal again, I&#8217;m back into my routine; washing, using the loo without even thinking about it now. I get up and see Jo watching me. I&#8217;m not embarrassed. 

�Good morning, Fifty,� she says as she opens the cell door. �Before we start today, let&#8217;s talk for a few moments.� She sits on my bed and I kneel on the floor. �Tell me, what do you think are the characteristics of the ideal slave?�

It's a strangely difficult question, because it&#8217;s such a big question. I've been here so long now and that has been the entire focus of my training. But somehow it doesn't seem as simple as it does when I'm in the middle of a task I have been given &#8211; or on my knees in front of the Masters or Mistresses. And then there is the tension inside me when I think about Joe and me. The moments pass and Jo waits patiently, seeing that I'm considering my words carefully. 

�Well, Mistress, I&#8217;d say obedience, responding quickly to instructions and carrying them out properly. And respectful behaviour to her owners.&nbsp; And doing what owners want, not what the slave might want and to be content with thinking about what the owner wants first and what the slave &#8211; I&#8217;ll say me &#8211; I mean being happy to put what I want second. And not to be � er �disappointed by always coming second.�

I am still wrestling with my thoughts and Jo senses I&#8217;m not finished. She pauses and I go on:
�When I first came, well, I had no real idea what on earth was going to happen. I mean, how this whole experience could last two months but now I think two months is maybe not long enough �&nbsp; And I also think that&nbsp; it&#8217;s different if you are in a happy D/S relationship at home. The girls who are &#8211; I guess like Judy &#8211; are really lucky. Me? Well, I feel this tension inside about how I will get on with Joe when he gets back and when I&#8217;m at home again ��� �

Jo interrupts me. �Those are all good answers, Fifty. It&#8217;s interesting to see that you are moving towards one of the specially important things which is about anticipation. You were starting to tell me about relationships, which is key in consensual BDSM. But I was after practical things at the moment, in particular to do with anticipation. The best slave isn't one that just obeys orders. It is one that acts without the need for orders, one that knows what needs to be done to provide for the Master's or Mistress's comfort and does it, and spends every waking moment thinking about how to be of service and then putting that into action. Did you ever see that film Gosford Park? I&#8217;m thinking of the scene in which the Housekeeper says: &#8216;We aim to be the perfect servant. We know when they will be hungry before they do and have food ready in anticipation �&#8217;&nbsp; So she knows when her Master is hungry and the food is ready, she knows when he's tired and the bed is turned down, she knows what he wants before he knows it himself. You shouldn't just aim to be good you should aim to be the best, the perfect slave.� 

�I can see that Mistress. But, it's a big challenge.�

�Otherwise the slave is a little more than a robot or worse. She&#8217;s someone that is only indulging themselves; using her owner as her slave.�

�Yes. It would be more like the Stepford Wives than Gosford Park.� 

Jo lifts one eyebrow and then laughs. �That&#8217;s very good, Fifty and I think you are exactly right. I guess to really make the relationship work, there has to be some unpredictability and surprises coming from both sides. Now, to change tack for a moment. Tell me Fifty, have you come across the expression, 'topping from the bottom'? It's where the submissive takes control of the relationship and uses his or her behaviour to drive the dominant in the direction that the submissive wants to go.�

I nod. It's something that Angela accused me of a few times. I wonder again how she is getting on. I guess she must be back at the university by now, assuming Connie has finished playing with her. I allow myself a little smirk. She really did deserve something. Jo brings my attention back to the here and now.

�Well, you'll know it's quite common and it&#8217;s where quite a few D/S relationships come unstuck. And perhaps some more conventional relationships too. We can avoid that when you are with us because we have more control over you, but when you are back with your owner or partner �.. well it can be an issue.� I think that she&#8217;s trying to give me a subtle warning. �Anyway, Fifty, I would like to give you some practice at anticipation.&nbsp; For the next few days, your main task will be the personal servant of Master Gerry. He'll be living in the guest suite. You will look after him there and see to his every need. You will aim to be the perfect slave. Do you understand?�

�Yes, Mistress, but I'm not sure that I can live up to that.�

Maybe the model to keep in mind is the relationship Lord Peter Wimsey has with his &#8216;Gentleman&#8217;s Gentleman.&#8217;&nbsp; Of course Bunter would be an important step up from you because he is not a slave, but I'm sure you will give it a good try. Take yourself up to the guest suite after breakfast in the morning and start then. The security has been programmed to let you through. Now, before you get to work, something more personal. How are you feeling? I'm sure your back must be sore.�

I nod, grateful for her concern. �Thank you Mistress Yes, it does feel bruised and sore.� Not like a session with Ylena, though, I think to myself. �But, it&#8217;s not too bad.�

After Jo leaves, I think for a long time about what she has said. It makes perfect sense, of course. Why should the Master, or Mistress, have all the responsibility of deciding what needs to be done and when? Of course it has to be the role of the slave to see what is needed too, and then to anticipate the owner's needs. Maybe, that's the problem I've been having with Joe. Or, he has been having with me. Maybe I need to think more about what he needs and not always seem to be pushing him towards my wishes?

It's the following morning after breakfast &#8211; which includes much more admiration for the new areas of tattooing that Jonathan filled in yesterday. I head off to the guest suite, determined to do the best I can in looking after Gerry.

It's a small set of rooms; a bedroom with a large walk-in closet and en-suite bathroom, a small kitchen with a well stocked fridge and cupboards, a comfortable lounge, and a small bare room &#8211; not as big as the closet. I take the latter to be slave accommodation if required, especially given the rings set in the walls and the floor. There's a suitcase on the bed and a carrier bag on the floor beside it. Gerry's things, I assume.

I'm not sure what to do. I have a look around the rooms. There doesn't seem to be any sign of Gerry and no one has told me what to do. One thing I do know is that Gerry is very fastidious about his appearance, he'll want his clothes to be neat and tidy. Actually, he'll want the suite to be neat and tidy too so I decide to put his things away for him. I unpack his suitcase into the drawers in the bedroom and hang the shirts and trousers in the closet. I arrange his washing and shaving things neatly on the shelf in the bathroom. There's a book in his bag. I put it neatly on the table in the lounge. It&#8217;s called &#8216;External Works&#8217; and it&#8217;s huge. Curiosity gets the better of me and I leaf through it. Really, it&#8217;s more of a catalogue. The book is full of ads and contacts for things architects and builders might need to put outside a new development. Top soil, stone paving, cast iron bollards, it&#8217;s all here in astonishing variety. I guess that Gerry must be an architect in �real life�. � I close the book and turn to the job of putting his other things away.

Everything looks tidy and I'm feeling quite pleased with myself. Then I think, his shirts looked a bit creased from being packed. Perhaps I should press them, there was an iron and a board in the closet. I'm about to set the board up in the bedroom when I think, what if he came back now, he wouldn't want to have to watch me ironing, so I take the board and the iron and his shirts into the small slave room. There's just enough space for me to work. It doesn't take me long and when I've done his shirts are crisp and fresh. He'll be pleased, I'm sure. Actually I&#8217;m pleased with myself and then surprised and disappointed that I have never thought of being this careful with Joe&#8217;s things.

I'm wondering what else needs to be done, when Gerry turns up. He's looking a little stressed, which is unusual, he's normally so laid back. �Ah, Fifty,� he says. �They said you'd be here. Now, can you unpack my stuff and ...�

�I've done that already, Sir,� I say. Gerry looks pleasantly surprised, I feel smug. �Why don't you sit down and relax for a moment. Perhaps I could get you some tea or a drink. There's plenty in the fridge here. I'm sure I could find something that you'd like or I could go down to the kitchens.�

Gerry collapses on the couch gratefully. �Nice idea,� he says. �But tea! Jeez, you Brits think that's the cure for everything. I'll take some coffee if you can make something that tastes like coffee rather than that instant stuff. And don't go running off, I like to see you around. I'm still pleased with the job I did on your scalp. It suits you and I like looking at it.�

�Thank you, Sir,� I say, pleased by the compliment, but a bit taken aback by his revelation. 

I forcibly return my mind to practical questions. �There's an espresso machine in the kitchen and fresh ground in the fridge. How would you like it?�

�Oh,� Gerry says with a smile, �just like me, straight, black and short.�

I smile in response and disappear into the kitchen. When I come back with his coffee he's leaning back on the couch. I put the coffee down beside him on the table. �You look as though you had a hard day at the office, Sir,� I say. �Can I be of service? Perhaps, you'd like me to take your shoes off? Maybe a foot massage would help? Do you want to tell me about it? Sometimes, just talking can help you relax, too.� 

�Hey, slow down, Fifty,� Gerry says. �The last thing I need right now is an eager slave. I'm just going to chill out for a while, read my book and relax that way.�

�All right, Sir,� I apologise and suppress a giggle as best I can. He is right of course. �I'll kneel by the wall over there, if you like, until you need me.�

�That's very good, Fifty. The last thing I want at the moment is pressure.�

I do as I said and kneel down. I don't want to stare at Gerry or have him wearied by me fidgeting in the corner so I consciously cast my eyes down to look at the floor. I hear the clink of his cup as he finishes his coffee and the quiet flap-flap of paper as he turns the pages of his book. It is difficult to stay kneeling, still and silent but I focus on trying to make sure that I do nothing to distract Gerry. I suppose it is an hour later, I&#8217;m feeling stiff from trying to keep still for so long. I hear Gerry stand up and walk across towards me. He puts his hand beneath my chin and lifts my head up.

�Fifty,� he says, �that's been a great help. I really needed that chill out time.�

�Thank you, Sir,� I say.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

�And, right now, I'm going to take a shower.�

�Yes, Sir,� I say, �There are towels in the bathroom. And your washing things are in there, too.�

�Thank you, Fifty.� Gerry smiles and heads off into the bathroom.

I wait until I can hear the swoosh of water in the shower and follow him. I can see the dark shadow of his body behind the shower screen. I gather up his discarded clothes, place a bathrobe on the stool beside the wash stand, and scuttle out again.

The clothes go into a washing basket. I lay out a clean set on the bed and then I clear up the empty coffee cup. There doesn't seem to be anything else I can do at this point, I don't think that Gerry would welcome an offer to scrub his back, so I go to wait in the small slave's room. 
&nbsp;&nbsp; 
I am still waiting there, kneeling, when he comes to find me. He's still wearing his bath robe. �Come into the lounge,� he says. I follow him. He sits on the couch and beckons for me to kneel beside him. �Did you press my shirts?�

�Yes, Sir. Was that OK?�

�Definitely OK, Fifty, you're doing a terrific job and I feel much better after that shower.�

�I'm glad, Sir, I am trying to make things as comfortable as possible for you.�

�Well, you have been doing very well. I think you deserve a little reward, don't you?� He reached out and gripped one of my nipple rings. Even though the rings have been in for a long time now, my nipples still feel very sensitive if anyone touches them. I give a little gasp. �And, I expect that you like that don't you?�&nbsp; I nod. Gerry smiles in response and gets to his feet. Still holding my nipple ring, he leads me towards the bedroom.
 
�I like to see women enjoying themselves,� Gerry says as he encourages me towards the bed. He sits down alongside me. �OK Fifty, stay there.�

He leaves me. I wonder what is going to happen. I know that the staff aren&#8217;t supposed to have sex with us, but I find myself feeling that I might not mind if he were planning to break the rules.

I am wrong though. When he comes back he is leading Carrie on a leash.

�Now, Fifty-two,� he says to Carrie, �I hear you&#8217;ve been learning to improve your massage techniques. I want you to show me how well you&#8217;ve been doing.� 

Soon her fingers are gliding across my back, lubricated with some spicy smelling oil. Then she has me roll onto my back. She carries on with the massage, playing with every part of me. Well, almost every part of me. She carefully avoids touching me anywhere close to my sex but the more that she stays away from this, the more aroused I become. Her touch does become more sexual, however. Her fingers start playing with my nipple rings, twisting them in their piercings and brushing past them as her hands push my breasts upwards. Her hands caress my scalp. She rolls my nose ring through its grommet and then lets her hands slide down my neck, brushing along my arms to the inside of my elbows. With each touch I become more and more aroused, until I'm lifting my hips each time her fingers brush against me and her hands stroke across my skin. My hands start to stray towards my groin but Gerry leans over and takes them very gently. He puts them back on the bed, shaking his head and saying, �No, just enjoy her touch.� 

Carrie moves one hand between my thighs. I think for one delightful moment that she is about to continue her touching there. But, all she does is to part my thighs, before she moves her hands back to my nipples. I whimper with a combination of frustration and desire, until finally Carrie lowers her head and buries her tongue in my sex. After her attentions to every other part of my body it seems to take no time at all before I come.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

�Ohh, thank you,� I sigh, as I collapse back on the bed.

�That's for being a good slave,� Gerry says, taking credit for the kindness that Carrie has done me. �You Brits may not know anything about service in restaurants, but you can get the idea if you put your minds to it.�

�You're teasing me, Sir� I say, sensing that a little levity wouldn't be out of place.

�You're right, Fifty,� he says, with a grin, �it's one of my great pleasures.�

Carrie hasn&#8217;t spoken since she came in to the room and Gerry doesn&#8217;t want her to stay. He sends her back to her cell.
 
Slowly I regain my composure. It's curious, I think. Usually, you'd expect the slave to pleasure the Master but he has obviously delighted in watching Carrie&#8217;s pleasuring me. I reach out with my hand to his thigh, indicating that I'd be only too happy to do the same for him, whatever the rules say. But he just takes it in his, lifts it to his lips and kisses it. He shakes his head. �Not now, Fifty. I have some things to do.� He sees my look of disappointment. �Enjoy that for now. Maybe I'll have you play again later.�

We don't, but it doesn't matter. He goes out of the suite and I spend the time while he's gone cleaning up in the bathroom, straightening the bed and laundering the clothes that he took off. He comes back. I cook for him and wait while he eats. I clear the dishes and wash them, all without a word from him or me. I go back to see that he's watching TV -&nbsp; American football. Again, without speaking I kneel beside him, remove his shoes and socks and massage his feet. He smiles and lets me. When I finish I curl up at his feet like some pet cat. He reaches down and strokes my head for a moment before his attention returns to the game. I don't mind, I just snuggle myself closer to him, the back of my neck against his feet.

It's only later when the game is over and he gets up and says he's going to bed that I leap up and dash away to turn down his covers and plump his pillows. He comes in as I finish, watches as I hang up the dressing gown he had discarded on his bedroom chair, and lets me wait until he has climbed into bed. I say, �Good night, Sir,� and get as far as the door before he calls me back.

�Come here,� he says turning back the quilt. �Thank you, slave. You&#8217;ve done exceptionally well.� I can&#8217;t remember when I last felt so proud of myself.

I spend three days serving Gerry in the guest suite. He never beats me, never gives me an order, and never fastens my cuffs. Yet, at the end of it I am more of a slave than I have ever been in all my time at Inward Bound, lost in my desire to anticipate whatever it will be to bring pleasure to my Master. And yes he does make sure that I keep my head as smooth as a billiard ball, so there&#8217;s clearly no escape from that expectation!

I overhear Gerry talking to Jo, saying that he has to leave here today, that he won't be sleeping in the guest suite tonight. Almost without thinking, I am packing his case, folding his shirts, and gathering up his things from the bathroom. When he comes back to the room all is ready. He looks at the packed bags, smiles and puts an arm around my shoulder and kisses my scalp. All the while, I'm thinking why did I never try to do this for Joe?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

It used to be like this with us: when we first met. There was nothing I would not do for him, nor him for me. After marriage &#8211; well I suppose the pressure of our jobs and other �responsibilities� encouraged us to take each other for granted. 

Finally, I realise that this is what I want: our first relationship alive again. Somehow, whatever happens after I leave Inward Bound, I have to make this happen for me and for Joe.


Chapter 28: A New Beginning
Course 8 / Day 56: Course Progress Meeting

Participant Notes: Fifty

Jo: Fifty will complete her first course with us today. We can expect that she will need some level of ongoing support following her return to normality especially after her experiences with the rendition. Please direct any support request calls from Fifty personally to me or Charlotte for at least the coming 8 weeks.

Jenny&#8217;s Recollections:

It&#8217;s the end of final day of the course.

There are sorrowful goodbyes at the Centre. Jo, Corinne, Ylena, Jonathan, Charlotte and, best of all, Gerry are all there to see us off. But, just before I leave, there is one thing that reminds me that maybe things aren&#8217;t over.

As we&#8217;re standing in the hall waiting to be taken back to London, Jo goes to the small table that stands on one side and opens the drawer. She takes out a small pistol shaped handpiece and points it at each of our arms in turn. �There,� she says, �that&#8217;s checked all of you out on the system for now at any rate. It will stop the alarms going off when your tags can&#8217;t be sensed any more. Oh, and can we have our collars, wrist and ankle cuffs back, please?�

It feels very strange not to have them on, but I wonder if it they can be removed from our mind quite so easily? And what&#8217;s even stranger for me at least, is to be wearing clothes again, even though it&#8217;s just jeans, flip-flops and a tee-shirt!

As the tag reader beeps when it senses my chip I&#8217;m reminded that, whatever else, I&#8217;ll still carry quite a few mementos of Inward Bound. It will be quite a challenge adapting to everyday life again, especially since I&#8217;m going to have to relive it all in my mind; while writing it up and preparing the research proposals, whatever Angela says. I will have to tell the faculty at Inward Bound just what I&#8217;ve been up to. I wonder if I we will be able to go on with this after all that has happened?

We&#8217;re just about to leave when Charlotte emerges from the house with a flat, square, red, leather-covered box. She waves to Judy to come forward and calls for our attention. �I think you all know that Judy has been on her second experience here,� she says. �Well, her real life Master has asked if we can make sure that he can keep track of her after she leaves here.� Charlotte opens the box. Inside is a slightly heavier version of the collars we&#8217;ve been wearing at Inward Bound. She takes it out and clips it closed around Judy&#8217;s neck with a rather final sounding �clunk�.

�If any of your Masters or Mistresses are interested,� Charlotte goes on, �it works by reporting where it is using a Global Positioning System. It can be programmed to report its position every hour or more often, provided you plug the collar in for a re-charge on a regular basis. Or it can be set it up so that your Master or Mistress sends a text message to the collar and it will respond with where it is. Now you need never be worried about getting lost again. I think Judy&#8217;s Master was worried that she might wander off.� Judy doesn&#8217;t look entirely pleased with this development but she doesn&#8217;t say anything. She puts her hands up to feel the collar as it sits in place around her neck. �There&#8217;s no catch that you&#8217;ll find,� Charlotte says. She holds out a silver ring. �The collar has a magnetic lock. Your master will have this ring. He will be able to unlock it should he wish.� Judy drops her hands to her sides and nods submissively. Charlotte smiles. �There,� she says. �now you are all ready to go.�

A few moments later, I'm sitting in the same vehicle that brought me to the Inward Bound Centre with the same four other girls that were with me on the day we arrived here almost two months ago. But, this time, they are being a bit more severe with us &#8211; as a last fling we have been given discipline hoods to wear on the trip back. Well, I guess that&#8217;s progress. We were all chatting away together as we waited in the entrance hall but now we're all quiet -&nbsp; we cannot be anything else! However, I suspect each of the others, like me, is lost in thoughts of what has been and what has yet to be.

George drives us back towards London. Eventually, we stop. Charlotte has made the return trip with us and strips off our hoods. We&#8217;ve stopped on the Embankment, opposite the London Eye. It&#8217;s time to get off and finally go our separate ways. She embraces us individually.

�Well, are you glad you came?�

�Yes, Mm..� Charlotte stops me with a finger against my lips.

�It&#8217;s Charlotte now, not Mistress - now that we are back on earth,� she says.

I laugh &#8211; we all laugh &#8211; and at last head off back to our everyday lives. Well, except Judy, maybe.

In true Inward Bound fashion, I have been given an envelope with an Underground ticket which will take me to Marylebone and a rail ticket to get me back home. At least, this time they&#8217;ve also given me some cash to get something to eat on the way back. Mind you, I have lost absolutely all my spare fat and I&#8217;m not for putting it back in a hurry.

So, at last I am back, unlocking my front door. I feel strangely flat, lonely, aimless. Going into my own home at last, there are the familiar smells of home, but an odd, empty aura too. 

The message light on my answer phone is blinking. I had told people that I would be away so I wasn't really expecting much. Four calls. They all turn out to be from Angela.

�Jenny, call me as soon as you're back. You've no idea how anxious I've been about you and how keen I've been to hear about your research.�&nbsp; BEEP �Hi, Jenny. It&#8217;s the Prof. Really keen to talk to you. Call me.� BEEP �Jenny, I'm guessing you should be back soon. I really need to get to work on a paragraph for our Department&#8217;s submission in the RAE. I've done something, but you'll need to review it.&nbsp; Plus, I guess that you'll want to do a British Association presentation too. Call as soon as you can.� BEEP �Jenny. Sorry, but this is really urgent. Now I've got some Americans that want to talk to me about this. Call when you can.�&nbsp;&nbsp; 

I listen to Angela&#8217;s voice warily. Her insistence, her sense of urgency, contrasts sharply with the curious flatness that I feel. She hasn't once said anything that might show any sign of interest in how I feel. Then, I think about the dates and times. These messages are all two weeks ago. What was Angela thinking of? She knew I was supposed to be away for eight weeks. She suggested eight weeks, but she&#8217;s calling me after six weeks ��. Did she contact Inward Bound and ask for me back to work on the RAE submission? And then there is the sinister reference to 'The Americans' . That must have been the Agency.&nbsp;&nbsp; She hasn't called since. Ha! I guess she&#8217;s had something else to think about. A wide smile breaks out across my face. I&#8217;m sure I can rely on Connie! In fact I have never felt happier about Connie than I do now.

The phone rings. Against my better judgement I pick it up. It's Angela.

�Jenny, thank goodness, you're back. We really have to talk. As soon as possible. Are you coming up to the university tomorrow?� 

I listen to Angela without saying anything. She still doesn't stop to ask how I am and if she feels any remorse or even questions her actions after her encounter with Connie and the Agency, whoever they were, it doesn't show.&nbsp; I don't really have a chance to speak as Angela crashes on and actually I don't want to.

�So, how soon do you think you can get back to work on the RAE? I've done something, but you'll need to review it and I want to make sure that you've got a good structure for the presentation I mentioned too.� 

I don't say anything. I just drop the handset back onto the cradle and hang up. The phone rings again. I don't answer it. I know it will just be Angela and I don't want to listen to any more.

One of the things that Inward Bound offered to organise was to keep an eye on the place while I was away. The keys have been left on the kitchen table with a note, an envelope addressed to me - and a bag containing a pair of linen trousers, a white sleeveless top and a pair of sandals. I smile. The note reads, �Welcome back, Jenny. You'll find things a bit strange for a while. If you need to talk to anyone give me a call. You know where to reach me. Love. Jo. XXX�

'A bit strange' is something of an understatement. It's a nice thought but right now I don't want to talk to anybody, I just want to think.

A shower is always a good start. I head upstairs and strip off. I feel more comfortable naked these days. It is bliss to stand under the stream of hot water knowing that no one is watching me. The water feels good on my skin and tingles on my bare scalp. Even after all the time at Inward Bound that still seems strange, but only occasionally, now.

Once out of the shower, as I run the towel over my arms, I remember the RFID chip. The scar has virtually gone now; you wouldn&#8217;t know it was there. Unless you had one of those readers. I suddenly have a horror of setting off alarms as I go through supermarket checkout. Surely that can&#8217;t happen, I think. Perhaps I&#8217;ll call Jo and ask her. 

I look over my shoulder at my back in the bathroom mirror. My tattoo might not be finished but I still think it&#8217;s magnificent. I wouldn&#8217;t have thought I would like something so large but it&#8217;s so dramatic, so &#8211; well &#8211; beautiful. I hope Joe thinks so too.

I sprawl on the bed and flick on the television. I haven't seen any in two months and I can't say I've missed it.&nbsp; I thumb through channels aimlessly, then click it off and toss the remote aside. I stretch out on the bed and suddenly I'm really tired. In moments I'm asleep.

I wake up. Really awake. Really rested. It's still dark. I grope for the bedside clock and press the button. It&#8217;s only half past two in the morning, but I am awake. I haven't felt like this since the last time I flew transatlantic. It must have taken me three or four days in Denver before I got around to waking up at the right time. Only this time I haven't crossed any oceans, leastways not in the usual way.

I go to make myself some tea, padding downstairs, still naked. The message light on the answer phone is blinking. Two messages. I must have been sleeping soundly, I hadn't even heard the phone ring.

The first one is Angela. �Jenny, I'm so sorry if I caught you at a bad time when I called before. I do want us to get together soon. I'm really keen to find out how you got on, so why don't you pop around to my study tomorrow first thing.� I can think of a hundred reasons why not and not one reason why I should. She still hasn't mentioned her encounter with �The Agency�. I wonder if she ever will. I press the delete button.

The second one is Joe. �Hi Honey, just to let you know that I'll be back into Heathrow around seven thirty. Guess you're out enjoying yourself. Hope you haven't been too lonely. I've missed you. See you tomorrow.� I press the replay button and listen to it again and again.

The kettle boils, I pour water onto a tea bag &#8211; green herb tea seems like the best in the middle of the night &#8211; and take the cup through to the lounge. I curl up on the couch. I think back to my last few days with Gerry and I know just what I've got to do. I want Joe to have as good a home-coming as he possibly can have. I drink my tea and think through everything I need to do. It's going to be a busy day. 

I also remember the envelope, which is still waiting for me on the kitchen table. Inside is a letter and an �I might have known� smile breaks our across my face as I read:

�Dear Jenny.

Now you are back in your home environment, I&#8217;m sure you will want to keep the lessons you learned fresh so here is some home work for you:


We would like you to keep your head shaven if you can, although we realise this is some thing you will have to agree with Joe. For some slaves it can just be an imposition but we all thought it really suited you and it would be nice to think of you staying that way.



Keep up your training. Good physical appearance and strength are important for everyone as well as slaves. Remember, diet gives you muscular definition and exercise gives you strength and fitness. You will find a list of gyms local to you over the page. Join one!



Jonathan will be in touch to arrange another session with you, when you have had time to pick up the threads at work.



We expect you might want to see Ylena again before too long! Here is the address of her website. She will be looking forward to hearing from you. 



You will be able to contact your fellow slaves through the Inward Bound site.


Best wishes,

Charlotte�


I look from Charlotte&#8217;s note around my home. It&#8217;s tidy enough but it&#8217;s not kept to the standard to which I have just been trained! Maybe that&#8217;s why they had me doing so much housework! I stay naked&#8211; cleaning in the nip seems the natural thing to do now. Thankfully our home is not overlooked, especially not in the middle of the night. 

I set to with a will. Joe will be back tomorrow and I want everything to be just perfect. By and by all is to my satisfaction &#8211; right to the top of the Inward Bound scale, I reckon!

Next: food. I sketch out a menu for the coming week and a shopping list which buys to reflect what I&#8217;m actually going to cook &#8211; another first!&nbsp; 

It&#8217;s as I am cruising the aisles of our local supermarket early in the morning (with a shopping list that includes an electric razor, by the way!) that it occurs to me that I have not spent a moment worrying what other customers might think of this shaven headed girl with a ring in her nose.&nbsp; No one else pays me much attention. I&#8217;m now torn between conflicting emotions: first, surprise at not being �noticed�, second relief that no one else seems to mind and finally a surge of pleasure that I have absolutely no excuse but to keep my head shaven and my ring exactly where it is, Although, that&#8217;s something Connie took out of my hands. Thank you Connie!

As I get back home, a plan is forming in my mind. I check Joe&#8217;s travel itinerary: he will be landing back in London this evening, about 7.30 on a Thai Airways flight from Bangkok.&nbsp; A journey from London airport to the Midlands in the late evening is not much fun and very bad news after a fourteen hour flight. I&#8217;m going to book a hotel for us both &#8211; and the weekend in London &#8211; and no expense spared. Well, Angela&#8217;s endowment fund has saved our housekeeping expenses as well as kept me at Inward Bound. Time to take advantage of the opportunity.

The booking safely made, I rush upstairs to pack for the weekend: clothes for sight seeing and smarter clothes for going out, at which point I discover another little Inward Bound trick. A note from Jo this time:

�Dear Jenny:

We thought it was a waste for you to keep yourself cooped up in bras all the time &#8211; it&#8217;s not as if you need the support in any case. So we have removed temptation from you, but there&#8217;s a couple in case you have to go to some really formal do and a couple of sports bras. Also, Charlotte thought that as you enjoyed her bare feet so much, we would have you go barefoot more permanently, so we have only left you your sports socks, a couple of pairs of tights and some thicker socks for winter &#8211; and that&#8217;s all you will need.

Best wishes, 

Jo and Charlotte�

I can&#8217;t say I am exactly surprised at this turn of events and it rather confirms my earlier feeling that Inward Bound was going to be hard to shake off, not really that I want to. 

But at least it makes packing easier and I shall have to make sure I do not buy any �pinchy� shoes in future which will be much better for me! Funnily enough, going barefoot for two months has allowed my feet to spread and the only shoes I&#8217;ve got that are properly comfortable is a pair with flat heels and round toes &#8211; more suitable for a slave, I suppose� 

I am in plenty of time to meet Joe&#8217;s plane. I see him as he and his fellow passengers spill out of the Terminal Three Arrivals. He looks weary and has his head down as he wheels his case towards the lift down to the Heathrow Shuttle. I step out in front of him.

�Hi, Joe,� I say, putting my arms around him and planting a kiss on his lips. At first he is taken aback with surprise- I have not come to the airport to meet him before.&nbsp; Then his face breaks into a wide smile and he returns my kiss &#8211; and then steps back &#8211; and gazes at my septum ring (I have reduced the shock quotient by wearing a bandanna around my head). He is about to speak when I use the Jo and Charlotte trick on him: I press my finger against his lips and say, �Plenty of time for questions later! This weekend we are having a weekend to ourselves. No writing reports for you and no Angela, in fact, absolutely no Angela for me. Just us. I hope that&#8217;s to your satisfaction, Sir? Here, let me take your case�.�

I smile broadly as I say �Sir� and of course Joe completely misses the significance. But that doesn&#8217;t really matter to me any more. 

He smiles back and opens his mouth to speak, but again no words come out until he manages to say, �So, where are you taking me?�

Where are you taking me? Such a significant phrase for me over the past weeks �..

�A hotel. It&#8217;s obscenely expensive, but you deserve it &#8211; we deserve it. We have the room for tonight, Saturday and till lunch time on Sunday. And I have booked a show for Saturday plus dinner and then lunch Sunday before we go home.�

�Jenny, this doesn&#8217;t sound like you? What exactly have you been up to?�

�Well, I&#8217;ve been doing some fieldwork &#8211; it was a sort of close up observational project and (it&#8217;s now or never. As we pass through the tunnels to the train platform, I slip my bandanna off my head) I got really quite close up!�

Joe gasps and I laugh, then he laughs and suddenly it seems OK ���.

�Glory Be, Jenny I mean I, well I, I mean you, you&#8217;ve just never ��

�Never done anything like this?�

�No, exactly�

�No, you&#8217;re right &#8211; probably should have, ages ago. Well, I&#8217;ve done it now.�

�I&#8217;ll say! Yes, you have really done it now. But look you are going to have to tell me just what the hell Angela has had you up to���

We are now on the platform and the approaching train pushes a strong breeze ahead of it and the cool air playing around my bare scalp feels just wonderful. Gerry you don&#8217;t have to worry; I&#8217;m definitely staying shaven, I think to myself.

�Well, Angela (in a flash my memory has me back at The Facility. Connie is holding my hand. We are both looking at Angela on her laptop�� I wonder what Connie did with her? Whatever it was, I&#8217;m sure it was unforgettable, from Angela&#8217;s point of view!) Angela had me join this group which was providing � er � sort of extended BDSM adventure holidays and my job&nbsp; was to collect observations on the effects that the stress of the course had on the participants for a research proposal. And because this was the pilot phase of the project, we both thought it would be best if I was undercover as a participant on the course and these are some of the things that happened to me��

�Just some of the things?�

�Hmm, I&#8217;ll fill you in over the weekend.�

�Look Jenny is that bitch Angela manipulating you all over again?�

I turn and face him: �Joe, yes I think that was in her mind but I&#8217;m past all that now and I have learned the courage to be the person I want to be and I hope you will want to be with me as I truly am, too.�

�Jenny � I will always love you as you are.� Joe cuddles into me, anxious, protective. 

The hotel is very grand. The Portland is an off-the-scale Victorian building opposite the BBC, but it&#8217;s got just what I was looking for in the way of a special atmosphere for Joe&#8217;s homecoming. While he is in the bathroom I have his things unpacked, dirty clothes dispatched to the Hotel Laundry and fresh clothes laid out for him on the bed. 

So is this Topping-From-The-Bottom? No, definitely not. This is Energetic Service. I guess Joe will still feel uncomfortable about me being his slave. But what about playing at being his slave? In fact what about being his PA and leave the games for the bedroom and the privacy of our home? The PA does sound good, though. And, acceptable in vanilla company!

I&#8217;m undressed and getting out the clothes I shall wear to dinner when Joe comes in from the bathroom and confronts my tattoo. I hear him take a sharp intake of breath and I instinctively turn sharply to ask what&#8217;s the matter, thus quite unconsciously bringing my pierced nipples into view.

�Jenny! For goodness sake �.! Just what did they do to you?�

Joe comes to me and runs his hand gently over my tattoo: the skin is still rough and tender.

�It&#8217;s OK,� I say. �You will not be able to see it under this dress ��

�Well now that is a shame!� Joe replies. �Just stand away from me a little so I can get a better look at it, Jenny. I&#8217;ve never seen anything quite like it. I have always thought that tattoos were a bit tacky but this, this � it&#8217;s a work of art.�

�Hmmm, well it&#8217;s not quite finished yet. I&#8217;ll have to see the artist in his studio in London a couple more times at least.�

�Can I come?�

�Yes &#8211; I asked.�

�So is that where you have been? London?�

�No, we went somewhere in the country, I&#8217;m not sure where, it was to keep it all a bit confidential �.�

And so we are now in bed together. Joe is sleeping off the effects of his journey and I am laying awake, turning over once more the events of the past two months. There was a time when I would have been at Joe to make love as soon as we could, but now I am content for him to have his space. I begin to muse again about being a slave: anticipating the needs of my master, my owner; putting him first and being content to be second. Who would have guessed, on our wedding day that we would reach this point together? And then I begin to think about our wedding. The public vows we made. &#8216;To have and to hold. In sickness and in health. For richer, for poorer. With my body I thee honour. To cleave only unto thee.&#8217; The vows that I made to Joe and the vows he made to me. They don&#8217;t ask me to do anything different from what I want to do now.&nbsp; Except that the relationship is mutual, tender, patient, consensual.&nbsp; And, as I want to slave for Joe, I hope he in his way will want to slave for me and maybe we will both be able to say �the very instant that I saw you did my heart fly to your service; there resides to make me slave to it and for your sake�
 
Strangers often give little away about themselves. Lovers &#8211; especially married lovers have to trust each other with the knowledge of who they both really are: to be content and comfortable naked in each other&#8217;s presence. Physical nakedness is relatively easy because our sexual drives carry us forward like a fast rising tide. But to be spiritually naked and unashamed &#8211; that&#8217;s so much more difficult. I now think the unhappiness Joe and I felt probably had its roots in our &#8211; well my &#8211; inability to be honest about who I really was. My time with Inward Bound has at last given me the courage to finally let down my guard completely. I hope Joe likes the person he finds�

References

In this story, everyone seems to be doing research &#8211; Angela, Jenny, Larry, Harry, Connie and even Freddie&#8217;s  alter ego and name sake, Freddie Clegg, so we thought you might be amused to see some of the research Freddie ad I (writes Phil) did as we put the story together. We tried&nbsp; to give Thesis a sharper edge by writing as close to the real world as we could and we were surprised (to say the least) to find some of our own musings turned out to have very close parallels in the real world! We should also point out, by the way, that and neither Freddie nor Phil has any commercial connection whatsoever with any of the companies mentioned.

Chapter 1: Board Meeting


1. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Freddie Clegg Enterprises:

Readers who want to know more about this organization and about how Larry Ross came to be in their employ should read Market Forces, Freddie&#8217;s previous magnum opus!


2. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A University in the English Midlands:

There are several universities in the English Midlands. We have deliberately not been specific about which particular university Jenny Mc Ewan works at, but she lives in Warwick and there is one there ��


3. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Second Skin

This magazine was invented by Freddie but in the real world, you could always have a look at Skin Two! Their website is www.skintwo.com


4.  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Professor Angela Dawney 

Angela was inspired by Professor Madeline Dawnay, a character in the SciFi TV series &#8216;A for Andromeda&#8217; written by the noted cosmologist Fred Hoyle and broadcast on BBC Television beginning in 1961. Professor Dawnay was played by Mary Morris who sported a cutting-edge, short, butch, haircut when she played the part. Freddie and Phil are (just) old enough to remember the series! Sadly only one episode remains. The series is famous for being Julie Christie&#8217;s first screen role. It was remade in 2006 in an OK version for BBC 4 with Jane Asher in the role of Dawnay. (not really how we see the Prof at all, I&#8217;m afraid).


5. Huntingdon

A country market town north of Cambridge, England.


6.  Brick Lane

A commercial street in the Whitechapel district of the East End of London, near the old London Docks. It has always been a rather work-a-day area and after the docks moved to Tillbury became rather run down. Now, however, it is a centre for Indian food. If you like a good curry you can find one around here (with care). Also not far from where Jack The Ripper used to ply his grisly trade. You can find it on Google Earth, but we are not being drawn on which building is the HQ of FCE although it might be loosely based on an office that Freddie once worked in real life. 

Also the title of a proper (much hyped, shortlisted for the Man-Booker prize in 2003) novel by Monica Ali and more recently (2007) a feature film of the book. Probably more literary than anything Phil or Freddie aspire to. We&#8217;ll let you judge whether or not this is more entertaining.


7. Sarah and the characters at the Board Meeting

More about this desperate crew can be found in Freddie&#8217;s earlier story Market Forces &#8211; except for Connie Mbazu who first appeared in Freddie and Phil&#8217;s last story The Greenwich Tales. Phil had Connie just where he wanted her at the end of GT but this time ���.


8. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jenny&#8217;s surrendered wife fantasies.

Laura Doyle&#8217;s book attracted plenty of controversy when it was first published.

http://www.surrenderedwife.com/

Interestingly Wikipedia talks about a �surrendered wives movement� without providing any evidence for it at all beyond describing the basic tenets of the book. 



Chapter 2: Acquisitions


1. Kushtia 

Kushtia is a fictitious country somewhere between Afghanistan, Kazakhstan, Pakistan and Iran. It has got its own unique culture and you can learn more about it in Freddie&#8217;s tales Market Forces and Anthropology.


2. BDSM weekends

There really are one or two places you can go in the UK to spend a weekend in a BDSM guest house. Phil for one has never been to any of them and so we will not quote a web address except to say that you can look them up at: www.informedconsent.co.uk&nbsp; and then click the link to �services�. You might also want to have a look at www.ladomaine.com.


3. The Other World Kingdom

OKW really does exist and once again Phil has no personal experience to draw upon. However, their website makes it look as if the experience would be rather harsh, if you were a male sub. (But I guess that is the idea, says Freddie) If you dare, go to: www.owk.cz


4. Centre Parcs

A well known inland holiday resort company in the UK and Europe. Originally a Dutch firm, the Cambridgeshire village (as they are called) at Elvedon even used to have distinctly Dutch sanitary wear in the villas and the staff, including cleaners travelled around the site on bicycles.
Centre Parcs is very family friendly and vanilla but perhaps not completely. Phil read in the papers that the pool was open for adults in the late evening on a �costume-optional� basis. You might have to go to find out for real. It&#8217;s not mentioned on the website!

www.centreparcs.co.uk



Chapter 3: Fond Farewell


1. MUNCH.

Meeting of BDSM enthusiasts in vanilla venue. Especially good for new people to introduce themselves and take the measure of new acquaintances in safe surroundings.


2. Fancy your academic potential? 

�How to Get a PhD� from the Open University Press&nbsp; covers finance, choice of topic, and in particular, several pages about the relationship between the Phd student and their supervisor. Jenny and Angela would have found it useful &#8211; but if they had read it, Freddie and I might not have had a story to tell ��.

How to Get a PhD: A Handbook for Students and Their Supervisors. 4th edition
Estelle Phillips and Derek S Pugh. Available from www.Amazon.co.uk


3. Fetish Wear In Public?

Of course there&#8217;s a web site for it: http://www.publicfetishgirls.com/



Chapter 4: First Contact


1. Caf� Nero. 

It&#8217;s a large real-life chain of coffee bars in the UK : �the best expresso this side of Milan� they claim (�No,� say&#8217;s Freddie, �that&#8217;s mine!�) and they are actually very good! They are not known for their hosting of activities like these but you never know. Don&#8217;t you ever wonder what those people hunched over their laptops are actually doing?? :-)

www.cafenero.com


2. Santa Maria Novella.&nbsp; 

An up-market Italian firm of perfumiers . You can visit them at www.smnovella.it or Google Santa Maria Novella perfume to find an outlet near you. It is rather special.



Chapter 5: Goodbye &amp; Hello

1. Whitby.

Seaside resort on the north sea coast of Yorkshire, England. It&#8217;s very picturesque. A small harbour nestling in a steep sided estuary. Famous as the birth place of Captain James Cook and in the fiction of Bram Stoker, infamous as the port where Count Dracula arrived in England. 



Chapter 6: A Long &amp; Winding Road


1. Warwick. 

A university town in the English Midlands famous for its excellent castle.


2. Warwick Sports Centre

Warwick has several sports centres. This isn't based on any of them but it seemed a more likely venue for a swimming pool than Warwick Castle.


3. NX Hair

The shop; entirely fictional. The receptionist; entirely believable.


4. Hello! Magazine.

A glossy magazine available in the UK to keep you up-to-date with Celebrity Gossip,
a favourite of hairdressers and hospital waiting rooms.

www.hellomagazine.com


5. Journey Times.

We checked all Jenny&#8217;s journey times which were correct at the time of writing (least ways according to the timetables &#8211; we haven&#8217;t allowed for leaves on the line).

www.nationalrail.co.uk
www.tfl.gov.uk/tube


6. Marylebone Station

One of our favourite movies is the classic 1960&#8217;s spy movie The Ipcress File, which begins as two of the characters reach Marylebone Station. However, if you are traveling from Warwick to London, the train will indeed take you to Marylebone. There is one other Ipcress reference hidden in the story. Afficionarnos may spot it!

www.en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marylebone_station


7. The Elephant, Fenchurch Street

There is a brightly painted model elephant street sign hanging outside The Elephant and hence Jenny found her way to the meeting point easily.

http://fancyapint.com/pubs/pub2209.html


8, Gerry&#8217;s first speech.

Gerry paraphrases the speech from Jane Austen&#8217;s Pride and Prejudice given by the unsavoury Mr Wickham to The Bennets, just before he and Lydia leave for Newcastle where he will join his new regiment: �The carriage awaits, duty and honour call us to the North. Let us not say goodbye, but as the French have it, au revoir�. Blimey, sas Freddie, I hadn&#8217;t reaised we&#8217;d come over all literary.


9. NCP

National Car Parks has a facility not far from the Elephant pub.
www.ncp.co.uk


10. The Story of O

We&#8217;re guessing you know this already folk but in case you don&#8217;t:

en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Story_of_O

www.amazon.com/Story-O-Pauline-Reage/dp/0345301110



Chapter 7: Admissions Procedure

1. Collars and cuffs


There are a surprisingly (encouragingly??) large number of firms in this market. You might like to look at: www.slaveregister.com/listings/collars but what we actually had in mind were some of the Tollyboy products. Check out: www.tollyboy.com 

Once you are in the site, pick �jewellery� from the product index


Chapter 8: A Problem With Puppy Fat 


1. Body Fat Percentage.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_fat_percentage

www.topendsports.com/testing/tests/skinfolds.htm
 

2. Weight loss strategies 

Definitely Phil&#8217;s area of expertise. For more on this see The Greenwich Tales.

A helpful website is: http://www.anitabean.co.uk/weightloss.html but please bear in mind that this is a completely kink-free vanilla site.


3. Electro-conductive rubber

This really is available although the the kit used by IWB was entirely our&nbsp; own invention. Check out: http://shop.e-stim.co.uk/index.php?cPath=22_40



Chapter 9: Bad Hair Day


1. Ramatoulaye Diallo

�really was the Face of Africa. Here she is:

http://members.fortunecity.com/pete100/smoothoperators/id17.html


2. Inspired to shave your own head? 

For more information, visit: http://www.headshaver.org/&nbsp; Personally Phil suggests just having the barber or hairdresser give you a number 1 crew cut and then go over what&#8217;s left with an electric razor!&nbsp; (Alternatively, says Freddie, just wait for the advancing years and it does it on its own.)



Chapter 10: Piercing Questions


1. Chlorhexidine mouth wash

Sold in the UK as �Corsodyl�. The bottle cap doubles as a measure and has a mark on the inside to show 10 mls.


2. Celia&#8217;s Medical Kit

If you are into playing doctors and nurses you can get kitted out like Celia at: www.awbent.co.uk&nbsp; Pick up the link to scrub suits, for Celia&#8217;s blue surgical scrubs and www.westcountryclogs.co.uk&nbsp; for your own white surgical clogs.&nbsp; Alternatively Google search �toffeln�. 

Please remember that these are both completely vanilla, kink-free, firms, if you contact them.


3. Tongue piercing technique

As experienced in real life by one of us, but not in quite such an exotic way!!!!!


4. Medical Fun generally

If medical play is your scene you almost certainly already know about www.medicaltoys.com



Chapter 11: Why Weight?


1. Weight &amp; Strength Training 

There are dozens of books in the Amazon on-line catalogue and websites about weight training and the personal sites of bodybuilders &#8211; just do a Google search. However here are a couple of books Phil found helpful:

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;1. Weight Training for Dummies
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Liz Neporent, Susanne Scholsberg and Shirley J Archer . For Dummies Books: John  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Wylie

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;2. The Complete Guide to Strength Training
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Anita Bean, AC Black and Co.



Chapter 12: Ylena Zhukova


1. The bambach saddle seat

The saddle stool in the e-mail room was inspired by a real product which you can go buy yourself! Its called the Bambach Saddle Seat and you can find it at: www.bambach.com.au and www.bambach.co.uk

However, Bambach are not the only firm in this market.



Chapter 13: Is There Life After Housework?


1. Victorian Mosaic tiles.

These were very popular in their day and were often to surface the front porch of houses. And even the front path.&nbsp; Recently they have become popular again and two companies manufacturing the tiles are Original Style (www.originalstyle.com) and Maw &amp; Co.&nbsp; (www.maw.co.uk). 

The tiles are not too expensive but the trick is to find a tiler who can put then down correctly. The lines of tiles need to be ABSOLUTELY straight and the whole floor needs to be ABSOLUTELY flat.


2. The two bucket technique for washing floors 

This comes from �Is there Life After Housework?�, Don Aslett, Exeley Publications.

Don taught himself t be an expert cleaner to fund his was through college and remained in the business afterwards. His book is full of excellent advice on keeping the house clean yet reducing the work you have to do! (Assuming that you don&#8217;t have your own slave and even if you do this might help them free up some time for other activities)



Chapter 14: How To Be A Gardener


1. People chipping

When Freddie and I wrote The Greenwich Tales we were taken aback when two ideas we had invented for the plot actually came to pass in real life. The idea of chipping the IWB slaves seemed to be the sort of thing IWB might do but nature began to imitate art once more when we found a media report about a company in the United States which wanted to have some of its employees chipped: http://www.worldnetdaily.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=48760

Now visit this astonishing website: www.digitalangel.com and then follow the links to http://www.verichipcorp.com/ where you will find proposals for �wanderer prevention� and patient records data. In fact their Wanderer Prevention system is exactly what IWB seem to have installed &#8211; except that Freddie and I thought we were writing fiction!


2. The International Register of Slaves and Submissives

This can be found at: www.informedconsent.co.uk and follow the link to The Slave Register


3. Breastfeeding with pierced nipples 

Here are a couple of encouraging references: 

http://health.yahoo.com/experts/pregnancy/1957/can-you-breastfeed-with-pierced-nipples
and http://www.llli.org//llleaderweb/LV/LVJunJul99p64.html 

So if Jenny and Joe have kids in due course, Jenny&#8217;s pierced nipples will be one less thing to worry about!



Chapter 15: The Garden Party 


1. Naked slave waiters

This chapter was inspired by something Phil heard on BBC Radio 4. The COE of a Corporate Entertainments company was being interviewed and he disclosed that his most unusual request was to provide naked slaveboys and slavegirls to be waiters at a private party!&nbsp; 

So what on earth did you do? asked the astonished interviewer. 

Well, came the reply, I put it to the staff who were all very much up for it. We did the party and the staff were not naked &#8211; but they were not wearing much!

Unfortunately, neither Freddie nor Phil get invited to parties like that!


2. Jenny&#8217;s muzzle harness

This was inspired by an item available from Top-To-Bottom-Leathers: www.top-to-bottom-leathers.co.uk. When you enter the site follow the link to Products, then pick Hoods, then pick Muzzle Harness.


3. The Greek looking sandals 

The ones that we had in mind were from: www.pipersandals.com. Please bear in mind that this is a completely kink-free, vanilla, organisation, if you decide to contact them.

4. Jenny&#8217;s serving tray

This isn&#8217;t quite what we had in mind but if you wanted to re-enact the Garden Party, this would do the job:&nbsp; http://uk.geocities.com/voodoo_restraints/serving.html


Chapter 16: Getting What She Came For


1. E-stim things

http://shop.e-stim.co.uk/

Definitely kink-friendly and vanilla-free, this time! We also have it on good authority that some of the kit you can buy there and at other similar outlets could produce the effects enjoyed by Jenny!



Chapter 17: The Tattooing Incident


1. Jenny&#8217;s tattoo

There are lots and lots of tattoo sites on the &#8216;net. However you might like to look at 
www.tattoo.dk. Click to read the site in English, then click the link to see Erik Rieme&#8217;s work. His �latest� (as at May 2008) gives you an idea of what we thought Jonathan did to Jenny.



Chapter 18: Elementary String Theory


1. Shibari / kinbaku-bi 

Some useful information on shibari can be found at http://rare.ropemarks.com.



Chapter 20: The Problem With Research


1. Pump up the volume

You really can buy an e-stim kit which responds to an incoming signal such as music from a CD or moans and gasps picked up by a microphone!


2. Charlotte&#8217;s wedge for Jenny

Jenny was strapped to a �Liberator Shape� which you can find at: 

http://www.liberator.com/z_black_products_shapes_gamma.php



Chapter 21: Private Investigations


1. Research Assessment Exercise.

The majority of funding for British Universities comes from the Government. When Mrs Thatcher was Prime Minister, a scheme to assess the research quality and productivity of universities was devised and called the Research Assessment Exercise. It places significant demands on the university staff and the conversation between Angela and Roy could have taken place at any university in recent years! http://www.rae.ac.uk/


2. The Vice &#8211;Chancellor.

The �chief executive� of a British University


3. Research Ethics Committees

Exist to protect human subjects in clinical research. Many Learned Journals will not now accept articles and research reports for publication if the investigations have not been approved by a research ethics committee. The constitution and rules governing the committees will vary from country to country. Here is a link to the European Community arrangements which would apply to Angela and Jenny: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics_Committee_%28European_Union%29
and a more general reference: http://www.niehs.nih.gov/research/resources/bioethics/whatis.cfm


4. The British Association

Angela might have has one of a number of scientific societies in mind. An example of the species is The British Association for the Advancement of Science. Visit them at: www.the-ba.net


5. Harry

One of Larry&#8217;s former colleagues at Fredie Clegg Enterprises. Harry is in charge of what you might call �Black Ops�. You can read more about Harry in �Market Forces�, on Freddie&#8217;s Yahoo site.


6. Anatoly Kustensky

Another character from �Market Forces�. One of Harry&#8217;s Black Ops Team misidentified Anatoly&#8217;s daughter as an abduction target. Anatoly was not terribly pleased and Freddy has been trying to develop better relationships ever since!



Chapter 22: Extraordinary Rendition


1. Jenny&#8217;s Shibari Head Bondage

Phil didn&#8217;t think this was very credible so I found an example. I&#8217;m not sure that it&#8217;s an authentic Japanese form but I think it looks like the sort of thing Ylena might have done. (Check out the one named Basic Face Bondage.)

http://www.youtube.com/twistedmonkcom

2. Energetic CIA activity in London

Was suggested in the recent movie �The Bourne Supremacy� in a terrific scene which takes place in Waterloo Station.


3. UK Extradition Act 2003.

Now you might be surprised at how easily Jenny, Charlotte and Jo have been taken it by all this CIA hokum, but this Act was passed by the Government as part of its response to the �new situation� created by the 9/11 attacks in New York. The main purpose of the Act was to make the extradition of terrorist subjects easier but most extraditions from the UK have been to do with more routine criminal offences. A particular cause celebre in the UK was the case of the �Natwest Three�. Three former employees of the National Westminster Bank were extradited to stand trial in Texas on fraud charges. However they were British citizens who were alleged to have committed their crime in London against a British bank &#8211; which incidently declined to instigate a prosecution! However a fourth individual was an employee of the Enron Corporation which was what sparked the interest of the authorities in Texas. Formerly the United States authorities would have to show before a court that there was a case to answer, now after the Act ,they merely have to make a request for extradition and the British authorities are expected to comply. Which is what happened.


4. Connie's electric pony

This can be found at http://shop.e-stim.co.uk and follow the links to Electro Furniture and then to 
Very Alternative Furniture


5. �US says it has the right to kidnap British Subjects�

This was a headline in the Sunday Times, 2nd December 2007. The story continued� �a senior American Jurist has told Judges from the Court of Appeal that the United States reserves the right to kidnap british subjects and take them to the United States, if it suspects them of a crime in the United States�



Chapter 23: An Uncertain Future


1. Foreign Office, Home Office, Ministry of Justice

British government departments dealing with foreign relations, internal security (amongst many other things) and the Judiciary. www.foreignoffice.gov.uk www.homeoffice.gov.uk www.ministryofjustice.gov.uk


2. Amnesty International

A wholly admirable international non-governmental organization seeking (for example) the release of political prisoners: www.amnesty.com


3. Liberty

A British non-governmental organization concerned to oppose the abuse of power by the government and promote the defense of civil liberties. It was formerly the National Council for Civil Liberties. www.liberty.co.uk


4. Maslow&#8217;s Hierarchy of Needs

Abraham Maslow proposed (1943) the idea that humans prioritise their behaviour to meet their needs according to a hierarchy with Physiological needs (breathing, food, water, sex, sleep) taking priority over the needs for Safety, for Belonging, for Esteem and for Self-Actualisation. Although based on questionable research and by no means universally accepted it remains a popular way of explaining human motivation.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow's_hierarchy_of_needs

http://www.maslow.org/sub/lowry1.htm

&nbsp;&nbsp; 

Chapter 24: Some Restorative Justice 


1.&nbsp; Connie&#8217;s multi-coloured flogger.

We had the idea from the catalogue at Heartwood Whips of Passion.

www.heartwoodwhips.com



Chapter 25: Helping Others


1. The Milgram Experimemt

In the early 1960&#8217;s Dr Stanley Milgram showed that ordinary people tended to obey authoritative commands even when obedience was in conflict with conscience. 

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milgram_experiment

Jenny is probably being too hard on herself &#8211; Judy definitely deserved her spanking!



Chapter 26: I&#8217;ve Got You Under My Skin


1. Tattooing 

Tattooing has come a long way in recent years and there is no shortage of sites on the Net to give you pause for thought. However our ideas about Jenny&#8217;s tattoo came from Erik Rieme&#8217;s site:
www.tattoo.dk&nbsp; Click the link to read the site in English and click the link to Erik&#8217;s part of the site. One of our Editors did not think Jenny would easily put her trust in Jonathan &amp; Charlotte when it came to the design, but read the story of Torben&#8217;s Tattoo in Photo Collection 2 �..



Chapter 27: Seeking Perfection


1. Gosford Park

Gosford Park is an Academy award-winning 2001 film, directed by Robert Altman. The film is set in 1932 at an English country house and presents a murder from the perspective of the servants in the house. Rather than a simple mystery to be solved, the film uses the whodunit format to create a drama showcasing the tensions of the British class system. Many intertwining subplots detail the complex relationships among the characters, both above stairs (the wealthy guests) and below (the servants). The story is fictional, but features the composer and singer, Ivor Novello as a character. 

http://www.en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gosford_Park


2. Lord Peter Wimsey and Bunter

Lord Peter Wimsey is a fictional character in a series of detective novels and short stories by Dorothy L. Sayers, in which he solves mysteries&#8212;usually murder mysteries. Bunter was his ever faithful valet and &#8211; as required in all detective novels &#8211; sidekick. The novels are set in Britain contemporary to when they were written, from the early 1920s to the late 1930s; pretty much the time of another of Freddie&#8217;s tales, �The Golden Age�.

http://www.en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Peter_Wimsey


3. External Works

Gerry&#8217;s catalogue called External Works is real (of course). It has details of everything from traffic lights to tennis court surfaces and its quite interesting even if you aren&#8217;t an architect but are abit of an anorak like Freddie. You can find&nbsp; http://www.endat.com and pick up the link to External Works.



Chapter 28: A New Beginning

1. Keeping track of slaves.

The slave-tracking collar is really available. It&#8217;s really been designed for pets and the elderly but, hey, why should dog owners have all the fun? You can learn more about it at ... 

www.retrievatracking.com.

The magnetic lock on the collar is one that&#8217;s really available too. See it here at�

http://www.zip.com.au/~koroba/necklace/Neck0081.html

&nbsp; 
2. The Embankment 

This road follows part of the north bank of the River Thames in London, eastwards from The Houses of Parliament, it is a wide road and provides a dramatic stage for the final mile or two of the London Marathon. (and, says Freddie, �The Greenwich Tales�)
&nbsp; 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thames_Embankment


3. The London Eye

Is the tallest Ferris Wheel in Europe and provides wonderful views of London &#8211; its well worth a visit!&nbsp; 

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Eye

You can book tickets at the official London Eye website: www.londoneye.com


4. Thai Airways 

Their flight frm Bankok really does arrive at Heathrow at 7.30 pm &#8211; or it did at the time of writing!

www.thaiair.com


5. The Heathrow Shuttle

This is the railway connection from central London at Paddington Station to Heathrow Airport, although its correct name is The Heathrow Express. 

www.heathrowexpress.com


6. Jenny &amp; Joe&#8217;s Hotel

The hotel opposite the BBC was inspired by The Langham. See what you think at
http://london.langhamhotels.co.uk/


7. Jenny&#8217;s final musings 

The Shakespeare quotation is taken from Shakespeare&#8217;s The Tempest, Act 3, Scene 1.
