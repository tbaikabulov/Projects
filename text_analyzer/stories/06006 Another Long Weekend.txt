BDSM Library - Another Long Weekend




Another Long Weekend
Provided By: BDSM Librarywww.bdsmlibrary.com
Synopsis: Caroline and Alice set off for a break.






I knelt in the corner of her room and watched her move about. Her movements were always graceful and purposeful.



I had been by her side for three months. Her business was booming and I helped with her books. I spent my working hours behind a computer and my lunchtime, on most occasions, under her desk between her beautiful legs. 



Despite this, time together had been at a premium, and we decided to do something about it. We spent long hours planning a holiday, and the big day had finally arrived.



"Nearly packed, sweetie," said Alice.



I was not packing. Alice had told me it wouldn't be necessary. She told me to wait in the corner, and so that is what I did.



Our public games had come to an end, and for the most part we played in private now. Occasionally, Tim, Harold, or Robyn would drop in to have a bit of fun with me. We were one big, happy family. 



Unfortunately, like most families at one time or another, tragedy had struck us. Harold had been recently diagnosed with cancer. His health was deteriorating, and it had hung over our holiday.



"Go," he had said. "I wouldn't want to stop this little slut from getting what she deserves."



His voice had been surprisingly playful as he watched me, tied to a Sybian and being forced to orgasm over and over.



Finally, Alice stopped moving and locked up the bags.



"I love camping, Caz." She used my nickname. "The wide, open spaces, the clear blue skies, and most of all the privacy."



At the word �privacy� she looked at me and winked. She helped me up. 



"Come on. Let�s get you ready."



She slowly unbuttoned my top while I watched her. Her touch always sent waves of shock through my body. She slid the blouse down my arms, exposing my bare breasts. I no longer wore underwear.



She stroked her fingers over my nipples a few times. They hardened at her touch. She then placed her mouth around one and sucked it softly. I could have jumped her then and there, but I had learned some control.



Finally, she unzipped my skirt and it fell to the floor.



"Now let�s go down to the car," she said, taking my arm.



The trip in the lift no longer worried me. I knew by now that most of the people in the apartment block had been to at least one of Alice's parties. There wasn�t a single one of them who didn�t know me better than my gynaecologist.



We got to the car and Alice opened the boot of the big sedan. 



"In you get. Belly down." She gestured me to get inside.



I climbed in and lay face down. I had to bend my legs at the knee to fit in. Alice tied my wrists together, then my ankles. She pulled the two knots together and fastened them, holding me in a strict hogtie. She then rolled me on my side and placed a ball gag in my mouth. A strap around the back of my head held it in place.



"Now, little one." She looked into my eyes. "I hope you're not too comfortable."



She attached clamps to each of my nipples. As each one bit into my sensitive skin, I gave a little scream. She slid an egg vibrator inside my already wet sex, and switched it on low.



"See you soon," she said, and closed the boot.



The clamps on my nipples dug in. The vibrator in my sex was driving me wild. I felt every bump in the road, and I wanted to touch myself so badly.



In the darkness, I thought about that first weekend; the torment I had been put through; the denial of orgasm for so long; the moment when I had finally been allowed my release.



I knew Alice better now. I knew that she could deny me for as long as she wanted and I could do nothing about it. I also knew that she could give me pleasure that would send me to places beyond this world.



The car stopped moving. The engine died and there was silence, punctuated only by the tick of cooling metal. The suspension creaked as Alice got out.



The boot opened and sunlight shone in. As my eyes adjusted to the brightness, the silhouette slowly became Alice. I smiled as much as the gag would allow.



"Wipe that stupid grin off your face, slut," she said with a hint of laughter in her voice.



She untied my hands and feet and helped me out of the boot. There was no one around. The car was parked on the side of a dirt track. She took me by the arm and led me to the front of the car. I felt the rough ground on my naked feet and grimaced slightly.



"That�s the look I prefer," said Alice.



She laid me on the bonnet, face down and facing the front. The paintwork was hot from the engine underneath. She spread my legs and tied each ankle to one of the rear view mirrors. Another rope went around my waist and looped between my legs so that it rubbed against my crotch. Alice tied a rope between the waist loop and the back of my gag. When she pulled it tight, my head was forced up and back so that I now stared down the track.



Lastly, she took my arms and tied each wrist to opposite ends of the bumper. I was spread-eagled on the hood of the car like some grotesque ornament. 



My breasts were pressed against the warm hood, causing the nipple clamps to dig in more. The vibe still hummed away in my sex.



"I always wanted a Rolls Royce, with that flying chick on the hood," she said, looking down at me with a smile, "but you look so much cuter."



The sun shone down on my bare back. She started the engine and set off. She didn't drive too quickly, but it felt fast enough to me. The world came at me like I was on a rollercoaster. I was thrown about, pulling on my tied limbs, and the vibrations from the engine did funny things to my body. It was getting dark when we got there.



Alice pulled up and started to unpack, leaving me tied to the car. I watched as she put up the tent. She had done it before, I could tell, by the speed with which she did it.



She cooked her dinner. The smell from the barbecue was tantalising. She came over to me, removed my gag and kissed me passionately. I could taste the food on her, and felt my stomach rumble. She gave me a glass of water and replaced my gag.



"You snored pretty bad last night, angel. I don't want you waking up any animals."



I watched her go to the tent and saw her silhouette undress. Then the little light in the tent went out. I was left to squirm on the bonnet. The mosquitoes had a better meal than I did, and I couldn�t even scratch the itches.



I didn't sleep much. As tired as I was, it was never going to be easy tied like that. When, finally, the sun rose I was grateful to see Alice come out of her tent pretty early.



"Good morning, hun," she said. "I need you to kick start my day, sweetie."



She walked up to me and pulled up her t-shirt. She undid my gag and then pressed her sex to my face. I licked diligently and realised I was tasting something very sweet.



"Oh yeah, hun," she said, seeing the expression on my face. "I put your jam on there. We only have enough bread to make toast for me."



I licked hungrily at the sugary sweetness of her until finally I heard a moan of delight escape her lips. She backed away and went about making herself some breakfast.



She took her time eating, but at last she untied me and helped me off the hood of the car. She told me to go take care of my lavatory needs but not to dare cum, like I needed reminding of that rule.



When I came back she had laid some clothes out for me. 



�Get dressed, sweetie. We�re going for a walk. Don�t forget your backpack.�



I dressed, glad of some cover from the bugs that had been making a meal of me. Alice handed me the backpack. It felt heavy, and I heard a clanking noise as the weight shifted inside. I hoisted it onto my shoulders and we set off.



The track was fantastic. It was so peaceful up in the hills. We saw some wildlife and stopped for a picnic. Alice ate, while all I got was a glass of water.



Finally we came to a dead end and Alice turned to me.



"Through here, hun," she said. 



I followed her between two thick bushy trees into a small clearing, just big enough for the two of us. She grabbed me and kissed me more passionately than I could remember ever being kissed. Her tongue flicked against mine. My head was spinning, and I felt my sex stirring.



"Undress," she said.



I didn't argue and quickly undressed. She handcuffed my hands behind my back and lowered me into a kneeling position. She put a spreader bar between my legs and, unusually, she used padlocks to secure it in place.



With a small chain she locked the handcuffs to the spreader, trapping me in my kneeling position. She pushed a ball gag into my mouth and again used a padlock to secure it. I wondered why all this security was necessary.



I heard her moving about behind me for a while. She was whistling, which was a sure sign that I was about to suffer.



"Ok, hun," she said as she walked around in front of me. �Behind you is a lump of ice with a key frozen inside. When the ice melts, the key will fall to your hands and you will be able to unlock your cuffs from the spreader bar. The rest of the keys are back at camp. I'll see you there."



My eyes widened as I looked at her, not quite able to believe that she was serious. How could she leave me like this?



�What�s the matter, sweetie? Not quite mean enough for you?� She reached into the backpack and pulled out a jar. �This should help.�



She rubbed some honey on my sex and upper legs. I moaned at her touch. As she walked away, she kicked over an ant hill that was in front of me.



I watched as the insects crawled up my legs, and felt the small bites on my most sensitive areas. It itched like crazy, and I hoped the ice wouldn't take too long to melt.



The sun beat on my back. I felt the ants crawling all over my most intimate parts. Their tiny legs were amazing, their bites not quite so welcome. The pain kept my orgasm at bay.



Finally, after what seemed like hours I felt the key hit my back. At first, I couldn�t find it. I fumbled desperately and was just beginning to panic when I felt the metallic shape at my fingertips. I managed to get it in the lock and turned it. It opened with a click. I slowly got to my feet. My legs were stiff and sore.



I stood there, naked. My hands were cuffed behind my back. The spreader bar held my ankles about three feet apart, and the ball gag was locked in my mouth. I was going to have to walk back to camp like this.



I listened carefully. The only noises I could hear were birdsong and the wind in the trees. I struggled onto the main path. My movements were limited, and I knew I was going to need plenty of notice to get hidden if anyone else came along.



The stones on the path dug into my feet. My whole body had to move with every step. It was slow going. Dusk was drawing near, making it hard to see the track.



Despite my predicament, I was aroused. I thought of a group of guys finding me like this, then having their way with me. My sex was dripping. Some of the ants still clung to me, biting.



I saw the camp up ahead and started to move a little quicker. Then I saw something that made my heart sink. It was a car. Two more were parked behind it.



I heard voices, and tried to place them.



Slowly, I made my way closer, trying hard not to be noticed. I screamed into the gag when someone tapped me on my shoulder.



"Come on, hurry up." I almost died from relief. It was Tim. "You're the star attraction, slut."



He took me by my arm and dragged me across the rough ground. My feet felt as though they were torn to shreds. 



A camp fire blazed in the middle of the large clearing. Around it I saw Harold in his wheelchair, Robyn and Alice.



"About time, bitch," said Alice. "You've kept us waiting long enough."



I tried to say something through the gag in my mouth but it was useless. I looked at them, still feeling the ache in my sex, my juices flowing continuously down my leg.



"Time for some fun," said Tim.



He crouched down and undid the spreader bar on my legs. I shook them, enjoying the feeling of freedom. He placed a blindfold on me. As I stood in the darkness, I felt an occasional hand touch me. I heard giggling. Then I heard the unmistakeable sound of a hammer hitting something solid into the ground.



I felt their hands under my arms, lifting me. They pulled my legs apart and lifted me higher still. I screamed as they tipped me and lowered me onto a thick, metal object. It penetrated my sex, deep and deeper. Just as I thought I could take no more, my toes touched the ground. I tried lowering myself to my feet, but I could take any more inside me.



They removed the blindfold. I looked down and jumped a little, but I was well and truly trapped. I wasn't going anywhere, that was for sure. The dildo was deep inside me and the steel bar firmly entrenched in the ground.



"You like that, slut," said Alice. She gazed at me lustfully.



I stared back at her. The gag in my mouth stopped me from answering. I looked at the four of them as they smiled at my new predicament.



They left me there for a good hour or so. They ate, and drank, and enjoyed a laugh, usually at my expense. I was still unable to protect my naked body, and the bugs had a feast at my expense.



The food was driving me insane. Alice had cooked a roast on the barbecue, with all the trimmings. It looked and smelt like heaven. My stomach rumbled in protest. It felt like I hadn�t eaten in days.



The wine was flowing, and everyone was having a good time except the poor blonde with a dildo rammed up her sex. I felt a little left out, but that was about to change.



The four of them surrounded me. They wheeled Harold in front of me, a control box on his lap. Tim ran wires from it and attached them to the dildo inside me. I watched him nervously.



Harold turned a dial slowly and I felt the dildo come to life. The vibrations were deep inside me, slowly building. My jaw started to tremble, my head dropped as I tried to breathe. Then he turned it all the way back down.



I stood there, looking at him. I felt my juices still flowing and I wondered how the hell I could produce so much when I was so thirsty. I looked at him in his chair, this little old man, torturing a girl young enough to be his granddaughter.



He turned the dial again, slowly. The vibrations built. My head dropped back until I was looking up at the star-filled sky. My chest heaved and my eyes almost popped out of my head. I could feel my sex convulsing and I knew I was about to cum. Again, he slowed it right down. I screamed behind the gag. My eyes pleaded with him.



"It's funny, isn't it," said Alice, "how an eighty-year-old mute man can make you beg him."



My face was stop-light red. I looked into his grey eyes, the one part of him that was still full of life. He turned the dial again. My heart was racing. My whole body was alive. I moaned behind the gag. Again my body told him I was close and again he turned the vibe down. I was absolutely manic, begging loudly behind the gag.



Harold's body was shaking as he laughed at me. He toyed with the dial, teasing me. I begged him as best I could. He never stopped laughing.



They left me like that for a while. Robyn, Tim, and Alice ran their hands over my body. Every touch was like electricity through my body. The sweat beaded on me. My body was shaking.



Then I saw Alice. She stood there with her legs apart, a riding crop in her hand. Tim and Robyn stood next to her, also holding crops. They circled me.



They started to swat me all over with the crops. I squealed behind the gag. Harold started the vibe again. He quickly increased and decreased the vibrations. The crops hit me all over. I felt my body drifting, almost floating, then I almost launched myself off the dildo. My whole body was alive, and each time a crop hit me I felt another orgasm come. I went into subspace, and hoped that the feeling would last forever.



When I woke up finally, it was the next day. The sleeping bag was so warm I didn't want to move. The sun shone through the opening at the front of the tent.



I got up, and realised I was still naked. I stretched out my jaw. The gag was gone. 



I walked outside of the tent and stretched in the morning sun. Its warmth played over my naked body. I looked around and saw Alice walking towards me.



I noticed the other cars had gone. My friends must have gone home early.



"Morning, sweetie," said Alice. She kissed me gently on my lips.



"Hey," I said, realising I was pretty hungry and thirsty. 



Alice knew I would be, of course, and brought me over a bowl of cereal.



"Sorry, hun," she said, "that's all that's left."



I didn't care. I ate it quickly and washed it down with a glass of water that Alice poured for me.



We both sat and watched as nature passed us by. Finally Alice stood and took me by the hand. She led me into the tent, and zipped up the flap.



She stripped for me, slowly, and looked me in the eye as she lay down. I curled up next to her. I moved my body in close, pressing myself into her. I stroked my fingertips down her body and slowly across her sex.



I traced the tip of my tongue around her ear, listening to her breathing quicken. I looked down and watched as her chest started to move up and down.



I slid a single finger into her sex and started to stroke it around inside of her. I heard her inhale a deep breath, her body tensing up slightly, then relaxing.



"Christ, you know how to push my buttons, Caz."



I smiled inwardly as I kissed down her neck, occasionally flicking my tongue at her flesh. I nibbled gently along her shoulder blade. Alice moaned with desire.



I slid a second finger inside of her and moved both of them in and out. I was careful to avoid her clit. Alice pretty much always needed some clitoral stimulation to cum, and I knew how to avoid it.



I took her nipple in my mouth and sucked lightly on it. Her hips moved up, pushing at my fingers. Her breathing quickened.



I kissed down her body, feeling her rising and falling with her mounting passion. I kissed down her thighs, nibbling slightly, and removed my fingers from her sex.



I kissed along where her panties would normally lie. Her moans got louder. I could hear her almost praying for that touch. I slid the tip of my tongue between her labia, parting her sweet lips. I moved my tongue in circles like a building cyclone. 



"God! Please, Caz hun!" Another moan escaped her lips, the once-mighty Domme falling again.



I moved up to her hard little clit and flicked my tongue across it. My two fingers returned her dripping sex, opening her and moving quickly in and out.



Her breathing was ragged, her chest moving up and down quickly. Her labia were crimson, swollen and ready for the spasms that would soon flow through her. The scream came and I felt her juices fly past my cheek.



She shook for a while before finally coming to rest. I curled up next to her, my head resting on her chest.



"Caz, hun," said Alice, when she�d finally caught her breath, "will you marry me?"



I looked her in the eye.
