Synopsis:

After the First World War the Russian soldier Jurij Alexandrovich returns home from war imprisonment. Once he was a member of the most reputable family in his home-village, but now he has to discover that times have changed. After the Russian revolution the communists rule his country now. And to his bad luck it is his vengeful ex-girlfriend Alessia who had become the girlfriend of the lesbian political chief commissioner over his war-torn home-village.
As a member of the Zhenotdel (=Women's Department of the Party's Central Committee) Alessia has gained a lot of power herself and she's eager to use this power to take a bitter-sweet revenge for Jurij's former refusal against her. At first Jurij only loses his family's property to Alessia's red brigade.
He struggles despairingly to beware a rest of sovereignty, but Alessia has already developed a great appetite for taking a selfish advantage of her superior position over him. Within the depths of her soul, she truly wants her precious Jurij as her own. Thanks to the help of her influential girlfriend she starts to slowly "re-educate" Jurij into the new world order &#8211; into her world order!
With a combination of teasing hints, well-placed jealousy, wicked threats and pitiless denial he gets forced to go down into a very personal and erotic kind of submission to the steely will-power of Alessia and her friend. Alessia knows that she will have to confess how she really feels at some point, but she will hold out for as long as she can.

Suddenly the village gets re-captured by the anti-communistic White Army and the hero has to make a very crucial decision: Will Jurij become a traitor to free himself from Alessia's spell or will he keep her secret revealed and therefore accept her superiority over his fate?



[ INTRODUCTION ]

To understand the unsettling story of Alessia and Jurij you have to know a little about the history of their country and their own.

Alessia came into the world on May 11, 1892, in a small village of the western part of the Forecaucasus - quite close to the city of Yekaterinodar. She was the first child of the officer Igor Vasiliev and his wife Larissa. And she was also their last as Larissa died soon after she had given birth to Alessia.

Alessia grew up to be a beautiful girl. Her cautious father hired private teachers to ensure that Alessia would receive the best education that only a few women in that era possessed.

But when Alessia got twelve years old, Igor was ordered to fight for his country in the Russo-Japanese War. Although he adored his daughter more than anything in the world, he was forced to send Alessia into the custody of his friends Mr. and Mrs. Vasiliev.
Alessia's new foster parents owned a poultry farm with lots of brown chickens that kept them very busy during the day. Therefore Alessia spent a most of her time with her new step-brothers Michael and Andre.
Both of the boys got easily awed by Alessia's beauty and maturity as they were two years younger than there new sister. So it didn't take long until Alessia found out how she could exploit the growing interest of her step-brothers to her own advantage.
It just needed a little inklings and teasing to make them take over all annoying chores for her, while she still played the caring role of the older sister towards her credulous foster parents.
Two years later Alessia received an official letter that informed her about the honorable death of her father during an important military offensive against the Japanese forces.
As a war orphan Alessia felt that she was totally on her own now. More and more she gave herself over to the dark and bitchy side of her character. Although her step-brothers suffered terrible under Alessia's escalating tyranny, they never dared to squeal.
In an age of five-teen Alessia tasted for the first time the sweetness of total power, when she even persuaded her step-brothers to regularly tribute all their pocket-money to her. Without having any money on their own, her step-brothers needed to earn Alessia's high priced favor before they even could buy themselves a book of adventure stories.
One day Alessia decided that her favor would cost Michael a box of chocolates. At this time a box of chocolates cost five rubles - which was around the equivalent of 39 loaves of bread. Therefore the only way for Michael to let Alessia have her box of chocolates was to introduce her to his beautiful classmate Jurij Alexandrovich, who was the son of the owner of the local chocolate factory.
As Jurij turned out to be quite a smart and entertaining companion, Alessia allowed him to take her out. Two hours later Jurij was already head over heels in love for Alessia. And as Alessia loved to be loved it was the start of an exciting affair. For a couple of days Jurij was probably the happiest man in Russia.


But while Jurij's heart unconditionally adored Alessia, Jurij's mind kept always reminding himself that Alessia was just a member of the general crowd while he represented one of the most reputable families around Yekaterinodar. There was just no way how the relation between him and Alessia could be officially announced without hurting the pride of his high principled parents. In fact Jurij's affair with Alessia. But Alessia's spirit wasn't meant for the ungraceful role of a secret concubine.
She passionately cursed Jurij's cowardliness, but in the end she had to realize that Jurij would never bite the bullet. So she abandoned him with a courageous face-slap, leaving behind an utterly distraught ex-boyfriend.
Since that day Alessia and Jurij had never heard again of each other.

A few years later the dark clouds of the "Great War" (nowadays known as the First World War) came over Europe. While Alessia served her country at the local division of the Russian Red Cross, it was a matter of course for Jurij to take part in the real combat.



[ COMING HOME ] 

After the second year of war the Tsarist Russia started to experience famine and economic collapse. The demoralized Russian Army suffered severe military setbacks and many soldiers deserted the front lines. The Russians dissatisfaction with their Tsar Nicholas II and his policy of continuing the war grew until it fully escalated in two revolutions in 1917.
The Bolsheviks took over the political control. To relieve the still unsettled nation from the attacks of its external enemies, the Bolsheviks signed a peace treaty with the Central Powers on March 3, 1918, at Brest-Litovsk. The article VIII. of this treaty stated that the prisoners of war of both parties will be released to return to their homeland.
This article also affected the destiny of Jurij Alexandrovich who had stayed 723 dismal days in German war imprisonment since Russia's large but success-less counteroffensive in 1916.

On the foggy morning of April 15, 1918 Jurij trudged east down the endless road to the mansion of his parents.
Cursing and grimacing, Jurij hunched his neck deeper into the collar of his shabby coat. It didn't help much. The cold wind of the Russian April was insistent, plucking at his clothes and forcing its needling way inside.
With his pack on his back and his hands jammed deep into his pockets Jurij imploringly prayed to find a ride. And soon enough his prayers were answered when the carriage of his father passed by.
He hadn't seen his son in four years and it was an incredible hearty reunion.




[ A FATAL VISIT ] 


Jurij's safe return from this horrible war was commemorated with a great family celebration that lasted more than three days. For a short moment it seemed as if love, peace and harmony finally had found their way into the life of the Alexandrovich's. But at the afternoon of April 18, 1918 an ominous troop of around ten mounted soldiers appeared at the horizon.
As they approached the mansion of the Alexandrovich family it became clear that they were a small ridden force of the young Red Army.

Slowly Jurij recognized the silhouette of a woman moving along the riders. This wasn't .... No - that would be nearly impossible! But then the recognition of the mysterious woman hit him like a thunderbolt. It was Alessia!
Her voluminous brown hair was pinned up above a slender neck and pale shoulders, her cheekbones gave her face sharp features. Underneath her wool coat she wore a tight white blouse, featured by a silken neck scarf that flew in the wind. Her legs were clasped in brown trousers and knee high black leather boots.

All the memories of his unfulfilled love for Alessia flooded back into Jurij's mind although it had been ten years already, since he had seen her for the last time. Still it seemed that he had repressed how beautiful his former girlfriend had&nbsp; been. Jurij tried to compose himself as the group came closer, but it was impossible to stop his heart from beating wildly.
At the same moment Jurij was also recognized by this woman. Actually Alessia had been looking out for him as she knew he would be there. Now she began to have those feelings of unfulfilled lust in her loins. She once more started to&nbsp; think about all of the times they had spent together and how she had cried at that final night after slapping his face. If&nbsp; he only had not been so damn stubborn. A cruel smile crept over her face as she began to think about how stubborn she intended to become now in return.

"I am looking for Pjodr Alexandrovich?" the troop-leader shouted at them.

"Yes - that's me! And who are you?" Jurij's father answered in a brave voice - although his shivering revealed his raising insecurity.

"I am Vladimir Maximow - major of the Red Army! We have heard that you are hiding rifles from the revolutionary fighters. Is that true?"

"Who says that?"

"Just answer my question!"

"We have nothing to do with any weapons or any revolution. We just want to be left alone in peace."

"The Red Army fights for the evenhanded peace of all people Russia. Not just for yours! So we won't leave until you hand us over the rifles. Have I made myself clear?"

"Get lost!"

Without paying any more attention to the stubbornness of Jurij's father, Vladimir Maximow turned to his soldiers and ordered them to search the house.

Slowly Jurij's gaze wandered to Alessia. She had caught the eye of her ex-lover as well and sent him a slight smile. But before Jurij could say anything, Alessia had placed her gloved fore-finger over her smirking lips - indicating him that the secret of their acquaintanceship better kept unrevealed.
Jurij was confused but decided that it might be better to play along. The expression of Alessia's face didn't offer any explanation. She just continued to smile - knowing that this was just the beginning of a joyful game of female revenge she had in mind for her disloyal ex-lover.

He quietly stood watch from the corner of his eye, admiring how Alessia let her slender body slide down from her horse's back and followed her comrades into his home. Jurij and his defenseless family stayed outside - carefully watched by the steely eyes of Vladimir Maximow.

The sound of rough boot-steps and smashed boxes drifted out of the house. With teeth clinched Jurij remained breathless.
An endless amount of time seemed to pass until the soldiers finally moved out with their arms full of rifles. Jurij was flabbergasted. Where had his father had hidden so many weapons? And why hasn't he confessed his possession to the major of the Red Army???
Jurij took a frightened glimpse at Vladimir Maximow. He was smoking a relaxing cigar on the back of his horse - his expression one of total indifference.

Suddenly Alessia appeared. In the controlled attitude of a classy lady she stepped in front of Vladimir Maximow and saluted.

"We have seized twenty-five rifles, sir!" she reported. Jurij's spellbound eyes watched her pushing a streak of her curling hair from her forehead behind her ears. It were little details of bewitching cuteness like this that made his heart crush on her again.

"Thank you, comrade Alessia Vasilieva!" the major exclaimed, before his almighty look turned to Jurij's father.

"It's such a pity that you had to lie to me. Now I'm forced to reprimand you."

Slowly he took his gun out of his belt and aimed at Pjodr Alexandrovich.
Then everything happened very fast. There was a loud bang and red blood shooting out of Pjodr's legs. He staggered off balance and tumbled to the ground with a thud.

There was a sudden, deathly silence before Pjodr cried out in pain - the bullet seemed to had hit his left knee.

While everybody stand in shock, the major himself kept totally unimpressed by terrible Pjodr's screams. He just turned back to his troop, ordering: "Get back into saddle; we'll move on."

As Alessia has mounted her horse, she once more looked down at Jurij. A mischievous smile of satisfaction had appeared on her face. Not sure about its full meaning, Jurij decided to smile back at her.&nbsp; The troop moved on and half a minute later Vladimir Maximow and his soldiers went out of sight.

Every member of Jurij's family automatically run to help Pjodr. Every member except Jurij, who was too confused about the impact of the latest events. Lost in his thoughts he went back into the house.

A scarf lay on his table. Bewildered by is meaning Jurij let his fingertips rake through its silken cloth, getting it close enough to smell it's light scent. Alessia's desirable perfume pervaded Jurij's senses. As soon as he had closed his eyes, he saw Alessia's ambiguous smile again. It didn't take long until his mind also heard her soft voice, smelt her musky fragrance of arousal and felt her tender touches. Once more he relived the scenes of her sweet seduction and her bitter rejection.

But suddenly Jurij noticed that there was a book missing in his shelve. His diary! Alessia has taken the diary about his life between 1907-1914. The diary in which he had so openly admitted all his innermost feelings of effervescent adoration and the following desperate heartache towards his Alessia. Thoughts and feelings, that were private. Now it was Alessia herself that had captured these secret thoughts. Feelings of utter exposure waved over Jurij's defeated soul. But then strange feelings of a new inner connection with his former girlfriend rushed through Jurij, but unlike their last connection, this connection was somehow inevitable.



[ ASKING FOR A FAVOR ] 


At the next day the family council of the Alexandrovich's that the life around Yekaterinodar had become just too dangerous. Furthermore a quiet place was needed to cure the severe injury of Pjodr's knee. Therefore it was decided that would temporarily move into their secondary home. It was just a small dacha in the outskirts of the Caucasus Mountains, but they could reduce their demands for a cozy home as the summer was approaching.
Unfortunately the question, whether to take along the piano of Jurij's sister or the hunting equipment of his cousin, wasn't that easy to settle. Soon a passionate controversy between both of them broke out, while Jurij's dreams slowly wandered back to his ex-girlfriend.
With the assumptive acquirement of his diary Alessia had become an involuntary confidant of his most private thoughts. Maybe in exactly this moment Alessia's delicate fingers might flip through the pages of his diary. He would have given everything he owned for the opportunity to touch these fingers once more.

His thoughts were interrupted by his mother's sudden interjection: "What about you, Jurij?"

"I'm sorry, what have you just said?" Jurij startled from his day-dreams.

"I just argued that you're the fittest member of our family. Plus you are the most experienced in combat. So you would be the perfect choice for defending our property against pillagers during our absence!"

Jurij didn't have to think twice. This sudden prospect of occupying the family house for his own would give him the perfect opportunity to rearrange his relation with Alessia.
"Sure - I see it as my duty to protect the Alexandrovich's family during these troubled times." Jurij announced and so it was decided.
The family departed very early at the next morning under tearful farewell-rites that never seem to end. But finally Jurij was alone. Immediately Jurij saddled his horse for a fifteen kilometers long ride to the second gymnasium of Yekaterinodar. Jurij's cousin had told him that this gymnasium had recently become to local Red Army headquarter and therefore it would be the perfect place to start his search for Alessia, claim his diary back and maybe resettle their burdened relationship.

Forty five minutes later Jurij stood at the entrance door of the headquarters, but now his inner drive was somehow replaced by a repressive nervousness.
He took a deep breath to muster up the rest of his courage and forced his legs to enter the building.

The gymnasium had been totally converted into a provisional army camp. The entrance hall was crowded with armed revolutionists. Fortunately Jurij quickly discovered a small, basically-appointed reception desk at the other side of the hall. Behind a desk stood a gracile woman with a Bolshevik armband, who seemed to be a kind of porter here. Within a few big steps Jurij had approached her desk.

"Good morning. I would like to see Alessia Vasilieva!"

"And you are?" the porter mumbled, obviously bothered by Jurij's demand.

"Oh - sorry! My name would be Jurij Alexandrovich. I came to clarify a personal matter."

"Wait here. I am going to forward your request Commander Vasilieva!"

"Commander Vasilieva??"

"Yes. Comrade Vasilieva has been promoted to the rank of a Commander yesterday, as our former Commander Maximow left the city this morning to eliminate counter-revolutionary activities in the Northern Caucasus." the porter declared with a chuckle.

Before Jurij could even assimilate the full meaning of this surprising news, the porter had already left him alone through a door behind her. It was a strange feeling for Jurij to look at this door as this door was the only but still impervious obstacle that separated him from his adored Alessia. All he could do for now was take a seat and wait. Waiting for the return of the porter, Jurij couldn't prevent to overhear the rude talk of some Bolshevik soldiers standing nearby. They amused themselves by commenting aloud on whether it was preferable to shoot, hang or bayonet counter-revolutionist.
Suddenly Jurij felt very uneasy. He became sensitive to the appearance he might offer to them. Did he look too bourgeois? Were his clothes adequate to represent a revolutionary spirit?

"Commander Vasilieva is expecting you now, Jurij Alexandrovich!" The sudden calling of his name caused Jurij to nearly leap from his chair. Glancing at the wall-clock, he realized that a full ten minutes had passed since his entry into the gymnasium.

"Please follow me." the porter just ordered and already began to walk away. Hastily Jurij managed to follow her through several large rooms. Finally they arrived at a cozy office room in the back of the house. This room had definitely once been the well-furnished office of a slightly corrupt school-director. Alessia was relaxing herself on a noble leather-chair with plush cushions, while she mindlessly ate a shining red apple.
She already knew the reason for Jurij's visit. The only crucial question was, whether he would be freely willing to subject to her rule or if he would fight every step of the way.
So a curious smile filled her face as she noticed Jurij's entry: "Good morning Jurij. It's so nice to see you again."

"The pleasure is mine. I just came to ask you about my diary, which I am missing since our last encounter." Jurij instantly brought out his request.

The true reason for his forwardness was Jurij's doubt to resist Alessia's false pretenses once she had her chance to lull him with her possessive charms. Alessia on the other hand got visibly disappointed by this direct approach, so she didn't even bother herself to find a suitable answer. Instead she just turned to the porter: "Have you already assured yourself that my guest came unarmed, comrade?"
Startled, the porter looked up and swallowed dryly, before she had to admit sheepishly "...not yet, Commander Vasilieva."

"Then do it NOW!" came the daunting order from Alessia.

"Yes, Commander Vasilieva!" the porter blurted, careful to keep her eyes from Alessia's.

"Would you please remove your clothes for a security check." the porter dutifully muttered at Jurij. He just couldn't believe what was going on here. Quizzically he looked at Alessia, but her gaze remained untouched.

He kept standing there for a few more seconds, trying to decide whether he should leave the room under protest or he better obey Alessia's presumptuous demand. Finally he decided for the second option. As soon as he had started to undress his jacket, he saw her smiling. It was a mischievous smile, but nevertheless it was the most beautiful smile Jurij could imagine. It was this smile that made him understand beyond any doubt that he still loved her.

One minute later he was placing his neatly folded shirt over the jacket on the floor.

"The trousers as well!" Alessia insisted in a soft but haunting voice and took another creaky bit of her red apple.
Jurij didn't understand the reason for her humiliating acting towards him. Was it a part of a lesson she wanted to teach him? Still Jurij felt just too captivated by Alessia's feminine charms to disappoint her now. So he continued his undressing until he kept only wearing his socks and his white underwear (which was still clean to Jurij's relief).

The porter instantly started a 'physical scanning' of his nearly naked body. Jurij didn't know whether it was his humiliating nakedness or just the intimidating presence of Alessia, but he felt his cock gradually becoming hard. He also felt a rising heat in his cheeks as he desperately prayed that neither the porter nor Alessia would detect his cock pressing against his underwear.
A triumphal smirk on Alessia's face told him that his prayers were left unanswered.

"Your guest is unarmed, Commander Vasilieva!" the porter concluded at last.

Alessia kept smirking at Jurij for a few more seconds until she finally turned her attention back to the porter: "You may go now!"

"Yes, Commander." the porter quickly acquiesced and the left the room in a hurry.

"You are scaring me a little, Alessia." Jurij confessed to his ex-girlfriend as soon as the porter was out of earshot.

"I'll have to be a little scary, Jurij. After all I'm a Commander of the Red Army now."

"Yeah...I guess you are right. But why do you have to take it out on me? Don't you trust me anymore?"

"Oh, I still trust you, Jurij!"

"Then why have you let the porter undress me first?"

"Because I can make her undress you now. It's just for the fun!"

"For your fun maybe. For me it's no fun at all!"

Alessia just answered him with a wide grin, which made him feel more and more sheepish.
"What?" he inquired her weird happiness in an insecure voice.

Alessia just stood up and walked behind her desk, where she took out a very familiar book out of its top drawer. It was his diary!
Before Jurij could stop her, Alessia had already opened the book and began to read out loud:

"'14/07/1909 : Today it had been 35 days since I saw Alessia for the last time for real. But in my mind I still see her lovely smile every time that I close my eyes. It seems like the image of her grows haunting my soul the more I try to eliminate it out of my brain. I keep telling me that she is just a member of the general crowd which would disgrace the hard earned honor of the Alexandrovich's family and that the time will heal the pain in my heart. But the pain isn't getting any weaker. Right now I would to do everything I could to see her wonderful smile again. It was the most beautiful thing I had ever seen.'"

Looking up as Jurij, Alessia smiled sweetly at him: "For me this sounds like you would prioritize any effort that would make me smile over your own interests."

"But..." he mumbled, miserable with the knowledge that she spoke the absolute truth.
"But? But nothing, aren't these your own written words?" she implacably kept backing him into a corner. 
"...Yes!...But...that is...I mean....you were never supposed to read that!"

She raised an eyebrow: "But these are still the feelings you had for me, aren't they?"

"...ahem...I suppose...yes." he confessed.

She slowly stepped closer to him.

"I suspect you still have these feelings. You still want to have me back as your girlfriend, don't you?"

Jurij grew nervous. This definitely wasn't the way he had planned to settle the things that had happened between Alessia and him. Averting his eyes from Alessia's, he still managed to return a nod.

She drew the manicured nails of her right hand along his hairline, causing him to tremble visibly. She smiled radiantly - knowing the effect she was having on him.
"You understand that you owe me an extremely big favor if you want to compensate my hurt feelings after you weren&#8217;t man enough to own up to our relationship." She asked.

As Jurij felt her hot breath blowing over his cheeks, his brain finally stopped the clear thinking process. All of his senses were focused just on her. Lifting up his head, Jurij looked right into her sparkling eyes and admitted in a quiet but firm voice: "I will grant you any favor you ask me for!"

His response to her was making her feel wet between her legs and she knew that she just had to have this man back in her bedroom. It was the softest, warmest touch Jurij had felt for years when her hungry lips pressed against his. Still Alessia knew that the perfect time to show forgiveness hadn't come yet. Therefore she quickly turned away her lips in the same moment Jurij started to return the kiss.
"I will consider what we have discussed. Perhaps I shall send a guard for you tomorrow at sundown. You may dress again and then leave."
The look on Jurij&#8217;s face was that of bewilderment. He stood frozen in time for a moment. When she turned back to look at him, she lifted her eyebrows at him and coldly stated "Did you not hear me? Good bye."
"Yes. It just that I thought that... I mean...and what's..." Jurij shuddered.
"Spit it out, Jurij! My patience are wearing thin."
"...what's with my diary then?" Jurij finally managed to ask.
"Like I already said: Perhaps tomorrow evening I will send a guard for you and we can continue our discussion." 
Jurij was definitely not satisfied with this vague prospect, but it took only one look at her frosty face and he shrunk back like a child who had been scolded. 
"...ah....okay! Good bye, Alessia." he hastily said, reached for his clothing and walked himself out the door.
As soon as the office door had closed behind him, Jurij took a deep breath. As he was still only wearing his underwear, he decided to look for the next toilet, hoping to find a private place for getting re-dressed and thinking about this unexpected turn of events. Only twenty seconds later Jurij was seated on a public toilet, wondering about his situation. Why was Alessia teasing him so much, just to push him back at the last minute? Was she really just toying with him? The more Jurij recalled her ambivalent indications, the more he felt his loins begin to get that tingly feeling they get prior to erection. By the time he had replayed all the events in his mind�his cock was rock hard and he was stroking it with his hand. As he reached his orgasm, his lips uttered just one word aloud, "Al &#8211; Les &#8211; Si &#8211; A." 
With a sudden bang the toilet door was kicked open. Behind it appeared Alessia. 
"Jurij?" Alessia asked him in obvious surprise.
Lost in his thoughts Jurij must have totally forgotten to lock the door. Now the shock of hearing her voice again caused Jurij to freeze. There was stunned silence for a time before Jurij finally gasped: "W-what, are you doing here?" 
"Well, I might ask you the same thing. But from where I am standing it is quite obvious what you were doing." she stated with a devilish smile over the embarrassment shown on his face. 
Fully savoring her superiority over this awkward situation, Alessia let her gorgeous body lean against the opposite wall and went on in her most casual voice: "I would like to talk to you about that favor. I want you to enlist yourself to an experimental re-education program for our bourgeois citizens which are still convertible to become good communists. The program will be lead by me. So you don't need worry that you might suffer more psychological harms than absolute necessary. Do you accept?" 
"Yes."
She clapped her hands and smiled like a school girl as she said: "Great! So your first task as a participator of the program will be to set up a post on the outer edge of your field. Tomorrow evening I might send a guard for you and we can continue our discussion about your diary and the possibility of a future relationship between us." 
"I would like that."
She kissed his forehead and moved out. She was already out of sight when her beautiful head suddenly re-appeared behind the door-frame. Looking him directly into the eyes, Alessia asked quietly, "Do you always scream my name when you bring yourself to orgasm?" His eyes immediately went to the floor and he hesitated for a second. 
"Never mind for now Jurij, I have my answer already. Enjoy your way home!" she replied curtly, turned and walked out.
As he walked away and the door closed, Alessia reached down her pants and began to play with her clitoris ever so gently working herself up to being wet and her pussy lips swollen, almost getting herself to the point of orgasm�but not quite. She began to imagine how her poor Jurij would soon be sitting on his porch, impatiently watching over the horizon to see if a guard was on its way for him. But there would be no-one! Alessia intended to make Jurij wait until morning. Then she would send a guard for him with an invitation for a common breakfast with her to discuss the first steps of his �re-education.�



[ LONGING ] 

In the meantime a very confused Jurij was reaching his horse. In fact his visit at Alessia's office had tied up so many knots into his poor mind that he was only glad the gelding knew his own way home. Back at home he tried to keep focusing on caring for his family's estate: he changed the hay in the stables, lugged the water for bathing later and started to heat it over the wood fire he had kindled.
All night he tossed and turned, not really sleeping at all. Once more he was haunted by visions of her standing in his doorway. Then it occurred to him that he had just done the exact opposite of what his family left him here for. But that fact did not help matters any. And now she knew that he masturbates thinking of her.

When the sun came up, he continued his regimen of morning chores; changing the hay again, cleaning the barn and picking some vegetables for lunch. He even went out to the edge of the garden and picked a few wildflowers that had opened up, planning to bring them to Alessia. As he sniffed them, his mind wandered to his beautiful Alessia and he found himself daydreaming about her. In his mind, Jurij imagined how her smooth coffee-brown hair flowed down across her shoulders. The most striking feature about her, however, was her eyes. They stood out like shining green gemstones against the pale white skin of her face. But since Jurij had saw her again yesterday, it was no longer just the physical feature that took his breath away when he thought about Alessia. Since yesterday Jurij had felt a very special yet indescribable attachment to Alessia. The way she held herself, the slightly impatient, challenging, puzzled look upon her face, the unspoken questions of her eyes...
He needed to win back her heart &#8211; no matter what it would took! 
The day continued without event. As sundown drew closer and closer, Jurij began to get very nervous. He took another bath, got himself dressed in some of his best clothes and waited�and waited�and waited. Sundown came and went, the moon was soon up and moving, but no guard appeared on the horizon.
He wondered what could have happened. He couldn&#8217;t believe that she had not sent the guard to pick him up. He felt his heart breaking. When midnight rolled around, it finally donned on him that he was not going to be seeing his beautiful Alessia tonight. He started to imagine her pleasurably reading the written thoughts of his diary. Jurij remembered all his secret desires that he had only confined in this book. How could he only have been so stupid? No his diary had turned into an effective weapon in the hands of his beloved Alessia. Jurij realized that he just couldn't allow Alessia to keep his diary if he wanted to gain her back as his girlfriend. 
A look at his alarm clock told him that it already was 3 o'clock in the morning. The best time to break into her office and get his book back. At first Jurij was shocked about this bold plan, but the longer he thought about it, the more he concluded that he had no other choice. It was now or never!
One hour later Jurij was standing in the darkness of Alessia's empty office and eagerly tried to break to lock of her desk drawer. 
"Halt, state your business or I shall shoot." interrupted the sudden command of a Bolshevik soldier, who must have slipped into the room unnoticed. 
"It is I, Jurij Alexandrovich, and I was searching for my wallet that I must have lost here yesterday." 
"Please place your hands high above your head, Mr. Alexandrovich." 
When Jurij had completed this task, the soldier walked over to him, took one arm and twisted it behind his back, then came the other arm. A pair of cold handcuffs was placed on his wrists and he was escorted to some kind of prison cell in the basement of the gymnasium, that had been made as a temporary measure. To Jurij's slight relief it had been at least furnished by a plain chair, a wooden table and a quite uncomfortable looking bed. Once inside the cell Jurij had to torn off his clothing, leaving nothing but his undershorts and socks. As soon as Jurij were looked inside the cell the soldier headed away &#8211; probably to inform his commander about the actual turn of events.
The current commander in charge was no-one else but comrade Alessia Vasiliev, who was more than relieved to hear that&nbsp; her secret plan of using Jurij's diary as a bait for catching him red-handed had worked out this well. Outside of this walls the revolution of the Soviets was just turning the countries whole power-system upside-down. And thanks to her today's catch Alessia was determined to turn Jurij's former power over her upside-down as well. The next step this mission would require Jurij's awe &#8211; so awe was what Alessia was going to create!
After half an hour of pure boredom Jurij heard footsteps descending down the basement steps. With a load squeak the door was opened and Alessia entered the room. Her face was a mask of icy calm. Beside her walked in an escorting soldier, a young woman this time, who instantly began to secure Jurij to a chair. She did this job with an aura of confidence around her that intimidated Jurij to the bone.
Suddenly this unknown woman spoke up to Alessia: "Why are you going to permit undershorts and socks? This imperialistic agent could have a weapon in those items as easily as the rest, my dear."
Smiling cruelly, Alessia agreed with her friend and demanded that all of his clothing be removed and he be stood over in the corner. The guard performed the requested action and was dismissed. Alessia walked over to Jurij and smirked while standing close enough for him to smell. Speaking ever so quietly: �Jurij, be thankful she didn&#8217;t request a cavity search.�
Turning to Nastasija she declared: "A weapon in his shorts�please, all I see is a little agent's cap gun, we may have saved him some embarrassment had we let him keep his undershorts, but see now it&#8217;s getting bigger, I was wondering how long that would take Mr. Alexandrovich.� 
Then Alessia&nbsp; winked at Jurij: �You like being on display for me and my friend, don&#8217;t you?". 
By now Jurij&#8217;s face was a brilliant shade of red, his eyes looked at the floor and his cock was rock hard, his arms were still handcuffed behind him. He knew she already had her answer, but he also knew in front of this other woman was not the time to irritate her. How he knew that he wasn&#8217;t too sure, he just did. 
"Yes, Madam." 
"Madam? Have you just called me 'Madam'?" Alessia laughed. "That's so cute of you, Mr Alexandrovich. I simply adore how that sounds coming from your lips�but the choice of words still reveals your bourgeois heritage. You are really in need for a communistic re-education-program! Instead of 'Madam' you shall call me 'Commandress' from now on. Do I make myself clear?"
"Yes, Commandress." Were truly the only words he could speak. He was completely mesmerized by this moment and was sure if she touched him, he would embarrass himself and ejaculate all over the place, her feminine smell, her shiny hair, everything was such a turn on for him, he was unable to think of anything else. She turned on her heels and walked away. 
The two women began to whisper amongst themselves as though he was not standing in that corner with his cock rock hard. 
"Mr. Alexandrovich, I would very much appreciate an explanation as to why you got yourself caught in my office." 
" I was�um�well I was looking for my lost wallet." 
"Oh, really? But you know that breaking into a building of the Red Army is still a crime!? Now I am afraid I am left with two options�" she walked back over to him. Again stood close enough for him to almost touch, he could feel her hot breath on his skin and her aroma, was the most intoxicating scent his nose had ever smelled. 
"I can either seize all of your property, place you in jail and let the warden deal with you �or you can tell me where the rest of your family is now, after several Comrades have seen them moving southwards yesterday. In this case of such a co-operation your punishment for being a nosey little mal'chik [mal'chik = Russian word for boy] would be exclusively administered by me. Oh Mr Alexandrovich, decisions�decisions what is a Commandress of the Red Army to do�Would you like to tell me where your family is, or would you prefer I take your land by eminent domain?" 
"My family is at our dacha in the outskirts of the Caucasus Mountains, Commandress." 
"This dacha�you will draw me a map, Mr Alexandrovich, so that my men can go ask your family some questions about the connection of your cousin with several counter-revolutionary activities." 
Alessia&#8217;s escort walked out of the room. She was gone long enough for Alessia to whisper in his ear: "You keep being my good little mal'chik and I will reward you later." she licked his earlobe. She knew she was having the desired effect on him.
Now this was the one point at which Jurij was ready to protest, partly because he was so shocked by Alessia's demand to reveal the hidden place of his family and partly because of her boldness to address him - a fully-grown man - as her 'good little mal'chik'. 
"You can't do this to me!" he exclaimed in hurt pride, his face flushed.

"But I see no-one here who is going to stop me! Don't you agree, my little mal'chik?" she terrifying him. By calling him her little mal'chik once more, she slowly emphasized its intimidating effect on him. 
"Oh and the story of the lost wallet�I don&#8217;t buy it. It's more about your lost diary, isn't it?" Alessia smirked as she remembered one special section of his diary that she had read during the day. In this section Jurij had described how bewitched he had became by the sight of her wearing classy riding boots. Alessia gave it a try, lifted her right leg and placed her boot between his legs. The captivating scent of it's freshly polished leather entered Jurij's nose. And his secret confession in his diary proofed to be right indeed - when she looked into Jurij's eyes, Alessia saw nothing but desperate excitement. 
As she wanted to experiment with Jurij to make him as desperate as possible, Alessia began to press his cock against his belly and rubbed the hard sole of her awe-inspiring boot against the sensitive underside of his throbbing penis. A few moments later, Jurij was groaning in response and his arms bulged in the cuffs. 
"Please, Alessia! Please unlock the cuffs and we could have some nice moments together." he pleaded. 
She smiled at hearing him begin to beg. She put her finger into her mouth and released it with a suck and put it on his lips. Mocking his obvious desperation for her, she declared: "I am so sorry for you, my sweet mal'chik! But somehow I still believe that you are only interested in your own quick relief, aren't you? And you still haven't agreed to draw me the map, have you? If you are a good little mal&#8217;chik, I shall provide you ample opportunities to beg very soon." She really knew how to emphasize the right words to make him feel inferior at this moment. 
"But... Don't you remember the great time that we had once shared? Please give our love a second chance!" 
By then the female soldier who had escorted her re-appeared was back and Alessia changed back into a formal tone:
"Mr Alexandrovich, I intend to bring you over to the table to allow you to draw us a map to the dacha. What will happen to you after this, will depend on the quality of this information. Perhaps you go to jail, perhaps I deal with you."
"I am sorry, Commandress. But l cannot draw you such a map. I cannot betray my own family." 
"Isn't it cute, Alessia, how these imperialistic pigs always believe that they are still in a position to bargain with us?" the escorting woman laughed. 
"It really is, Nastasija!" 
Irritated by this cruel mockery about him, Jurij dared a short look at the woman who Alessia had just called 'Nastasija'.

"Take your greedy eyes down, you insolent imperialist!" she instantly barked at him.

Jurij stared at the floor, trying to burn the image of what he had just seen into his memory: This Nastasija was a dark haired woman who might be slightly taller than himself. She had an attractive face and a well-kept body of average proportion. Her age was difficult to guess, but she seemed to be even younger than Jurij himself. Still her composure bespoke plenty of confidence.
Her voice had become much warmer when Nastasija went on: "Not to worry, Alessia. We will get him to tell us. For now, let&#8217;s secure him to the cot and allow him ample time to contemplate the options presented to him�and later we shall try again."
"I guess you are right, Nastasija!" Alessia agreed.
Nastasija walked to the door and brought in two male guards.
"Secure him to his bed face up. Turn the heat down as well." came her harsh orders.
They nodded affirmation of their willingness to perform the requested task and set about their business. Within a few moments Jurij had been secured with his arms still behind him, under his back, his legs spread and attached to the steeled frame at the foot of the bed. There was a strap placed across his shoulders that held him laying down. He was powerless.

As soon as the guards had done their job, Alessia herself walked toward Jurij and leaned over his body so that her hair was bouncing in his face. She whispered into his ear: "My disobedient little mal&#8217;chik, haven't I already told you that I'll have to send you to jail if you don't show some co-operation?" 
"Please no! Don't send me to jail. You can't leave me!" Jurij pleaded in a whining voice.
But the cool air of the prison-cell and the adrenaline immediacy of this veracious moment, combined with the foolish sight of Jurij begging her so frantically while she hold implacable power over his fate were now stoking Alessia&#8217;s much-too-long-repressed, no-longer-forbidden inner fire to a level as unprecedented as it was indecent.
She made a cute sad face at him, curling her lower lip. 
"Please! Alessia! Don't leave me! I need you! More than I have ever needed someone else!" he cried out in rising horror.
Alessia was a bit taken aback by this revelation. In fact even Jurij was irritated by his own words as he had become more and more scared by Alessia's changed demeanor. But somehow this new demeanor also made him want to be around her even more.
"That's sweet! But I still don&#8217;t know what I am going to do about your lack of co-operation�" Alessia finally sighed.&nbsp; "For now, darkness is what you need so your eyes don&#8217;t get - shall we say - more full than they should get right now." 
With that her hands carefully lifted his head and tied a blindfold over his eyes, plunging him into complete darkness. While her breast rubbed against his right shoulder, she asked in her most enticing voice: "Jurij, would you like to kiss my boots for a last time before I leave you now? Quickly, yes or no?"
In fact Jurij would have preferred to lay his head on her shoulder and hear that she still loves him. But that scenario seemed very out of question, so Jurij only muttered: "Yes! ...please!".
"I thought so." Alessia just laughed at him. The fading sound of foot-steps told Jurij that Alessia were leaving the room - with her boots un-kissed.
But strangely Jurij didn't heard the sound of a closing door. Why wasn't Alessia locking it behind her? 
In the warden room right next to Jurij's cell Nastasija had already taken a seat on the couch. A wide smile appeared on her face at Alessia's return and proposed: "I think perhaps we should enjoy this relaxing morning while our imprisoned imperialistic agent might consider his options. Would you like a cup of tea, Comrade?" 
Alessia welcomed the offered refreshment and sat next to Nastasija on the couch and they began to converse about their ideas for the most promising 're-education'-methods for the pardonable citizens, who still withdraw themselves from the coming socialist spirit of Russia. 
Through the open doors Jurij was able to listen to every word and more than once a chilling shudder of terror run over his spine, when Nastasija debated about the way she would deal with suspects of political crime when she would came into power. But then their was a long pause and all of a sudden Jurij heard Alessia's sweet voice asking: "May I?" 
"Of course, Alessia! You know I love when your tongue touches me there." 
The rest of what Jurij heard consisted of moans and moisture noises. Shocked by the news that his Alessia was open for bisexual experiences, Jurij was left to imagine what was occurring so close to him. And this image filled his heart with utter jealousy. Yet he wasn't about to get angry at Alessia &#8211; instead it was Nastasija he despised. How could she even dare to steal Alessia from him? Jurij had just returned from four chasting years of war and war imprisonment. He had every right to get some erotic stimulation from a woman now. But instead this bitch called Nastasija was taking his hard earned prize. Who was she thinking that she is? Jurij felt in deep urge to walk over to them and kick Nastasija's ass out of this gymnasium. But unfortunately his chest was too effectively held back by the leather straps and there was just no way to stop Nastasija now. He felt his frustration rise to a level that he had never felt before. 
As Nastasija's moans became still louder, Jurij's blindfolded eyes could clearly see how Alessia was kissing every centimeter of Nastasija's creamy white skin before Nastasija wrapped her well toned legs around Alessia's head and Alessia's lips were settling in her pussy. When Nastasija was building to orgasm she loudly encouraged Alessia to lick this and suck that. Then they seemed to rest a bit before Jurij heard new moaning sounds from Alessia. Nastasija had started to return the favor and made love to Alessia's body. Hearing those moans come out of Alessia&#8217;s mouth, made him want to cry, knowing that someone else was causing them.
Slowly Jurij's mind began to accept that he had no chance against Nastasija in the competition for Alessia's love and tenderness. In this discipline a desirable woman like Nastasija seemed to be just invincible for him. After all Alessia didn't even let him kiss her boots. Surprisingly these thoughts made his cock grow hard as a rock again, only this time his nut sack had begun to shrivel with the cold air. 
It felt like hours to him, before he heard the women in the next room talk again. 
"Do you think, he is ready to talk to me?" Nastasija's cold voice echoed into his cell. Her question scared Jurij a little, he did not know this woman, nor did she know him. 
Jurij thanked god when he finally heard Alessia answer: "I think I might have better luck, let me give it a try." 
With that Alessia stood up and walked over to the room in which Jurij was confined. 
"Did you enjoy listening to me and Nastasija make love to each other? A good mal&#8217;chik would have been permitted to watch�not disobedient ones however. I truly only want to talk to your cousin, won&#8217;t you please show me how to find him." Her fingertips found their way to his hairline and pushed the hair from his forehead away from his covered eyes. 
"Alessia�" he began to say but was cut short by a sharp slap across the face. 
"What did you call me?" 
"I am sorry, Commandress." 
"Not as sorry as you will be if you call me that other name in public again. Will you tell me how to find your cousin?" 
"No Commandress, I can&#8217;t." 
With her long nails she began to stroke along his upper thighs keeping her eyes directly focused his eyes. She trailed her fingers all around it but never touched it at all. He began to struggle against the cuffs and tried to move his hips to meet her fingers. 
Alessia just smirked: "You are sure that you still can't tell me?" 
"Please! ...you know that I can't do that!" 
"Then I shall be forced to surrender you to the guards and allow them to make an example out of you until you tell us where your cousin is."
She called out for the guards. When they arrived, they physically carried him away. 
"But...Please...you can't just..." 
"When you are ready to talk�you may ask the guard to summon me, and I shall come and see you. In the meantime, enjoy your stay my little mal&#8217;chik." The last sentence was so filled with sarcasm, he knew enjoyment was the last thing he would be getting out of any of this. 
"But there is nobody but me to take care of our stables!" Jurij desperately tried to chance her mind. 
"Oh &#8211; there is no need to worry. The estate with including the mansion and the stables will be seized by the Red Army as your continuing refusal to co-operate with us reveals you as an enemy of the free, socialist people! Now I am entitled to draft an according petition for this 'acquisition' to the High Commander. Thank you very much for making possessing your property that easy to me!" 
Jurij's face went pale. She was not serious!? She was just trying to scare him?! Or was she not? After all Jurij was left behind by his family to defend the family's property. But it seemed like this task had already become too much for him to handle. 
Jurij tried to calm himself by the thought that Alessia feelings for him would soon grow again. Then she would willingly return the estate into the hands of his family. And until that day would come, his family's estate might be even better protected under her power than under his.


[ CRACKING WILL-POWER ] 

Two guards placed Jurij back into his cell, where he was re-cuffed to the bed and blindfolded. He had long since urinated in the cot. When one of the guards finally re-entered his cell, he simply laughed at Jurij's mess and walked away. Only this time he locked the heavy door behind him, sealing Jurij even off from any acoustic perception.

Gradually his shoulders and back and legs started to ache, but there was just no way to relax them. Jurij thought about his two options: betray his family's location or loose the most fascinating woman of his young life. Oh how much he wished that he wouldn't had made this nightly trip for re-stealing his diary! However slight part deep inside of him was curiously enjoying every minute of this disastrous adventure. Somehow he was crushed by Alessia's authoritative aura and her dismissive rejections.
In fact Alessia had blossomed over the last three days into his ideal version of a desirable, yet unreachable superior woman - that kind of woman that he had thought of ever since his very first wet dream.
Where could she be right now, Jurij thought to himself. While he was forced to endure the endless monotony of a bound and blindfolded prisoner, Alessia might be just having a nice walk with this Nastasija!? Or she might be enjoying herself by reading his diary at a sunniest place of the gymnasium's garden!? A loud sigh escaped out of Jurij's mouth.
Meanwhile, Alessia sat on her bed in her private quarters and continued to read over and over again the passages that Jurij had written into his diary. As she read one particular passage of how enthralled he had become the day they went out for a walk. Some other boys had been playing ball together along the way. Alessia vividly remembered how she had teased one of them, while Jurij stood nearby. And now she could read in Jurij's diary how showing off her nice ass to the boys had made Jurij desperately jealous indeed. It also made him horny, and his cock hard as rock, as he continued with his diary entry. With sadistic delight Alessia began to wonder how Jurij must have suffered since she had allowed him a deeper insight into her special relationship towards Nastasija.
A very long time passed before Jurij's cell door was unlocked again and Jurij heard the clacking sound of approaching boot-steps. Out of a sudden a very small gloved hand engulfed his ball sac. The hand massaged and lightly pinched the tight skin.

Jurij felt filthy. Jurij felt cold. Jurij felt thirsty and he felt hungry. But more than that he felt scared that Alessia might transfer him to a jail of her High Commander and that he would never see her lovely smile again. After the last four years of war and imprisonment, Jurij was ready to suffer further privations, but he was definitely unready to loose Alessia for a second time. So the first sentence which came out of his mouth was a softly whispered "I love you, Alessia.".

But then Jurij realized in horror that he couldn't be absolutely sure that the hand which he felt belonged to Alessia. Suddenly Jurij felt very foolish to make such an important declaration to someone that he couldn't even see. He prayed that the touching hand would be Alessia's.

Instead of any reply Jurij just heard the noises of someone hearty biting into an apple. Was it his Alessia? Why didn't she say anything? It took three more minutes of uncertainty until the eating of the apple was finished and Jurij's lips were suddenly spread by some gloved fingers. The remaining apple core - complete with its stem &#8211; was rudely shoved into his open mouth.

"Swallow it!" Jurij was hissed at by a cold voice that clearly didn't belong to Alessia. Jurij couldn't believe that he had just accidentally confessed his love for Alessia to his greatest rival Nastasija.

"It's... it's you!? I didn't know!" Jurij burred with apple core in his mouth and lots of confusion in this head.

"I didn't say 'Talk stupid!', but 'Swallow it' !" Nastasija sternly reminded him of her former command. To win some time for getting his mind clear again, Jurij decided to better do what she wanted and began chewing the apple core and stem. His efforts very instantly answered by a hard slap in his face.

"Are you really that stupid? I want you to swallow it! In whole!" she hissed. "You didn't get my permission to chew it!"

So he choked it down.

"There you go! So you're still in love with my new girlfriend Alessia?"

It was strange to answer such a question to a person that Jurij could not see. So he only nodded bashfully.

"So you might be stupid, but at least you have taste. She is really something, isn't she?"

Jurij was unsure how to react on this delicate question. But as he still felt his cheek burning from her recent slap, he decided to better stay by the truth: "Yes, she is quite special."

"Don't you agree that the way her whole body begins to shiver when you drive with your fingertips over her spine is unbelievable sexy?" Nastasija kept teasing, just to laugh out loud a moment later : "Oh - how insensitive from me, but I forgot that she won't let you touch her body anymore!"

A feeling of utter helplessness rushed through Jurij when he realized that he could do nothing but silently endure this further humiliation. Closing his eyes under the blindfold, he tried to just concentrate his mind on the feeling of his body laying on the cot and get ready for the inevitable.

"So it's a great pity that you still have refused to draw the requested map for her. In the case that she couldn't obtain the information from you, Major Vladimir Maximow had instructed me to try out my personal line of questioning and interrogation methods. So now you'll have the pleasure to deal with me. And you won't want to disappoint me, do you?"

Jurij vividly remembered his first encounter with this heart-less bitch, he knew that 'disappointing her' would mean real pain very soon. Still he couldn't surrender the well-being of his whole family to her terror. But how should he answer her?
Before Jurij came to a decision, his hesitation was answered by one of Nastasija's gloved hands that grabbed his balls and squeezed them firmly until he began to wince with pain.

"Do you?"

"No! No!!! It's just ... I just can't betray my own family!" Jurij yelled out.

"We will see!" Nastasija answered him in a most calm and unpredictable voice, that actually scared Jurij even more that her shouting.

Her hand released his balls and tied some kind of cord around them. Covered in total darkness, Jurij couldn't identify the obscure noises, which followed when Nastasija began to fasten the rope to a chain and slipped this chain through two hooks in the ceiling. After that Nastasija connected a 'S' shaped hook to the other end of the chain and attached a large metal bucket to it.
The empty bucket might have weighed around one kilogram, which pulled Jurij's balls up into the air. But this was just the initialization for Nastasija's improvised torture device. Leaving Jurij helplessly bound she walked out his little cell just to return a few minutes later with a pile of thick folders from one of the offices upstairs.

"How many folders do you think your balls can take before they rip off?" Nastasija asked, but the blindfolded and confused Jurij didn't even get the question. Only when she put the first folder into the bucket and let him feel its pull on his cock, Jurij painfully understood.

"So where again did your family go to?"

Jurij' face looked mortified but still he refused her to answer.

"You may deliver your information to me willingly or I will take it by force. Either way I will get my answer out of you."

"Do whatever you want with my body - but you definitely won't make a traitor out of me!" Jurij shouted out.

"I will work on it!" Nastasija just replied in a frightening controlled voice before a second folder was dropped into the bucket and intensified Jurij's pain. Jurij became terrified that after this punishment his poor balls would never be able to produce fertile seeds again.

The third folder made Jurij even feel like his balls would soon be totally torn from his crotch. He was definitely on a direct way to hell.
As Jurij was blindfolded no tear escaped down his face. Only the little wet spots on the cloth binding his eyes told Nastasija, that her victim had started to cry. A spiteful smile run over her lips.

Suddenly Jurij heard another person entering his cell. Jurij might not have been able to see her, but he instinctively noticed the presence of Alessia.

With a courageous tug Jurij's blindfold was removed. After he had stayed in absolute darkness for so long the bright light made it difficult for him to focus on her. But slowly the silhouette in front of him turned into her beautiful face with her red lips smiling at him in a most lovely way.

"Hello, my little mal'chik! I see you're still making it easy for Nastasija to find a reason for torturing you?!"

"Please, Alessia! This woman is going to emasculate me. You have to help me!!"

"Come on! You can help yourself! Just tell her where we will find the rest of your family!"

"I just can't do that!" Jurij just whined.

"Haven't I told you that he is incorrigible?" came Nastasija's biting comment from behind.

Simultaneously both of them turned to Nastasija &#8211; Alessia in anger, Jurij in fear. But Nastasija just kept casually leaning against the wall, tapping her right boot impatiently on the concrete floor.

"Would you please let me speak with him for a second, Nastasija?" Alessia hissed.

"Sure - I just needed a break anyway! But if you don't squeeze the location of his family out of him within the next five minutes, I want to continue ripping off his balls!" Nastasija snapped back.

"Fine! After five minutes, he will be yours!" Alessia sighed, turning her attention back to Jurij.

But he just kept starring into the inscrutable shining of Nastasija's eyes. It was as if he was her prey &#8211; and in fact her prey was exactly what he would become in five minutes.
Grabbing his chin Alessia turned his gaze back to her.

"I want you to keep looking only at me, mal'chik!" he was reprehended by Alessia, who secretly enjoyed to sense a strange state of mind in his face. He was full of terror and full of arousal at the same time.

Now she only had to increase his arousal a little more and his pride would break like an eggshell. Slowly Alessia leaned forward to Jurij, pushing a loose strange of her soft hair out of her eyes and brushing it behind her ears. Jurij couldn't believe how horny he was getting just at the sight of Alessia. And as her body moved closer to him, Jurij's sexual desires were additionally inflamed by the sweet scent of her perfume that began to fill his nostrils.
With the wickedest of smiles, Alessia gave him a tender kiss on his forehead. Jurij was in heaven!

But too soon Alessia broke the kiss again, whispering at him seductively: "I must admit that I'm a little hurt by the fact that you don't care for me enough to share this info."

"Alessia.... I can't.... I can't tell you where the dacha is.... But I promise to send word to my cousin Mikael that I require his assistance if you let me go home."

"That's not the deal!" Alessia stated coldly and withdraw her lovely body from him.

She flicked her hair back behind her left ear, before her gaze turned to his balls. They were still maximally stretched by the counter-weight of the folders, leaving his cock perfectly accessible to her from all sides.

The knot of his hard-on was quite obvious although Jurij fought hard to maintain composure over his body's betrayal. Fascinated by its throbbing, Alessia grabbed for Jurij's penis, only to retreat her hand a second later in disgust.

"Phew!" she said, wrinkling her nose and waving at the air. "Your cock stinks of piss."

Jurij had never felt so humiliated before.
Alessia got up and asked: "Nastasija, would you please loan me your gloves?"

"Of course, you're welcome!"

Her delicate fingers smoothing slid into the thin, black gloves which fitted her perfectly. She wriggled her fingers inside the soft leather and smoothed them up her arm, and let the cuffs of her jacket fall back over them.
Under the new protection of the leather, Alessia re-placed her fingers on his cock and slowly traced its outline.
When her fingers reached the head of his dick, Jurij gave a small moan and his teeth dug into his lower lip. But Alessia was starting to really enjoy her teasing and let her fingers run even faster over his sensitive skin. His hands balled into fists. Out of a sudden the movement of her hand stopped.

"Does this excite my wretched lover?" she asked, with an apparently quite genuine curiosity.

"Yes..s..s!" Jurij admitted, weeping gently.

"So are you ready to give me a map and receive your deserved 'release'? Or do I have to let Nastasija question you again while your poor balls keep confined to her cruel new device?"

Horrified at her merciless words Jurij only stared at her wide-eyed with dread and fear. While her hand slowly stared to stroke his cock again, Alessia put an angle-like look on her face and said in a most innocent voice: "It sure is a shame to have to let such a beautiful cock go to waste by Nastasija. After you have lost that part of you, you will become completely useless to me. So I guess, I'll better say 'Good Bye' to you now." She stopped her manipulation and got up to walk away.

That was just too much! Tears running down his cheeks as Jurij finally sobbed out the address of his family's dacha.

"My sincere congratulations, Alessia!" Nastasija started to laugh out at the pitiful picture of the fully broken Jurij. Blinded by the tears in his eyes Jurij could only hear the clicking of her heels as Nastasija walked towards him. She released the binds holding him to the bed, untied the cord from the chain and slowly let the bucket went down again.
After the she rudely grabbed Jurij by the hair to drag him out of the room.

Alessia stood back to have a good look at both of them.

"What are you doing with him?" she asked with a amused grin on her face.

"I will bring him to the inner court yard and order the guards to shoot him."

Jurij started to plead: "Oh Christ...no....don't do this..."

He was so terrified that he could only babble out not-understandable fractions of words. Only a vicious kick of Nastasija's knee right into his still aching balls could silenced him.

"Hold on, Nastasija! You'll need Major Vladimir Maximow's permission for an official execution first!"

"Come on! We both know that Maximow will give us his permission anyway &#8211; even afterwards!"

Looking Jurij deep into his eyes Alessia answered: "But after his resistance he might be the perfect material to test my re-education program."

"Have you forgotten that he had also broken into your office? This act marks him as an obvious criminal and an enemy of the free, proletarian people. His case is hopeless! You will find better candidates to refine your so-called 're-education-methods'."

"I guess you're right!"

Nastasija just grinned back in triumph and pushed Jurij to continue his last walk to the execution yard.

Alessia still didn't break her gaze at Jurij when she once more opened her red lips to ask: "What if the map he draw us turns out to be bull-shit? Shouldn't we at least validate his information before we get rid of him forever?"

"You really can't get your fingers from him, can you?" Nastasija smirked.

"So what? Are you jealous of him?"

"Me? Definitely not! But I feel rather pity with him. After all shooting him might be much less inhuman than letting him become yours to play with." Nastasija smirked at her cruel joke.

But then Jurij was pushed by a slap on his ass towards Alessia. Jurij felt nothing but relief and gratefulness. He was pushed so hard, he tripped and fell to his knees in front of his beloved Alessia.&nbsp; Alessia had just saved his life. From now on he would owe her his unconditional loyalty.

Alessia seemed to notice these feeling that were going on in his mind. Sending him a knowing smile, she spoke: "Let's go Jurij, you need to wash. You stink of piss and I don't want you anywhere near me until you have cleaned yourself up."

As if it would be the most natural thing to do, Alessia grabbed the cord which had stayed firmly tied around Jurij's balls. Leading him by the cord around his balls, Jurij followed her out of the room.


Jurij was still too overwhelmed by his last-minute-rescue through Alessia that he didn't protest when she leaded him naked and barefooted up to the ground floor.

Before Jurij could gather his wits Alessia had already opened a side-door to the inner court-yard of the gymnasium. Jurij instinctively shrank back as he noted some foreign people at the other side of the yard.

At the next moment Jurij felt Alessia hand grabbing him by the hair and dragging you out.
Disgraced by his exhibited nakedness, Jurij began to whine:
"Come on, Alessia! You don't have to embarrass me like this. Why do you keep treating me like this?"

"You shouldn't complain so much! If your complaining continues�I can truly embarrass you in ways you can only imagine, mal&#8217;chik. Remember that you can define yourself still as 'alive' after all, although we have substantiated that you are the offspring of one of the most viperous clan-ships of this region."

"'Viperous clan-ship'? What is it with my family anyway?"

"All these rifles that we have recently seized in your house originated from a raid of the white troops on a weapon depository of the former czaristic army! Therefore your so-called 'family' is either part of the counter-revolutionary conspiracy or a wartime-profiteer, who makes antisocial gaining out of this civil uprising. Either way your clan has to be marked as a traitor of the freedom-loving people of Russia.. Did they have all of those rifles in your house and you honestly had no idea they were there?"

"But I just returned from my war captivity in Germany. This alibi it the best proof that I have done nothing wrong!"

"Lenin has warned us not to become gullible in our fight against the enemies of the revolution. And Comrade Nastasija even claims that every members of an counter-revolutionary family have to be regarded as incurable infected by the imperialistic plague."

"Does...that...mean...that she wants to make me... liable for the crimes of my family?" Jurij stammered.

"No! She just says that you inevitably will become a threat to the socialist revolution as well some day and therefore should be executed presumptively!"

His eyes grow wide as his words strike your soul. "That's absurd! You can't punish me for a crime that I haven't even committed yet."

"Fortunately for you there is still me. I think that risky citizen like you can be put under quarantine and be converted into a valuable follower of our socialist dream. So from now on I will become the exclusive supervisor of your cure."

"Supervisor of my cure??? Have you forgotten that we had been lovers once? You will always be so much more than my supervisor!"

"I know!" Alessia sighed. "Your diary turned out to be very revealing when it describes the emotions that you had apparently developed for me. But I must warn you: I still might be entertained by your presence sometimes but my feelings of affection for you are gone. Now there is only one key to my heart left and this key is called C-O-M-M-I-T-M-E-N-T . And by commitment I don't just mean the kind of backup that you had once denied to provide me in front of your narrow-minded parents."

Short-taken by this presumptuous words Jurij could only stare at Alessia, but his astonishment even enlivened her demanding spirit

Taking Jurij by the hair she whispered into his ear: "This time I require that you will fully commit your soul to me. You must lay the destiny of your fortune into my hands and become completely M-I-N-E ! Do you think you can do that?"

Her sexy voice was just too on-turning for Jurij to reject her offer. Slowly he began to nod his head.
"Great! I will soon take you at your word - but first you need to be properly cleaned!" Alessia cheered.

During their talking Jurij had fully forgotten about the embarrassment of his public nakedness. When he finally became aware of the two fellows who were brazenly grinning at him, Alessia was already leading Jurij into a small garage at the remote corner of the yard.

Jurij was wondering what they were doing here as the inside of the garage looked quite neglected and ramshackle. The questioning look he sent to Alessia kept unacknowledged, as Alessia was already knotting a loop into the end of Jurij's ball-leash and casually threw it over a metal hook. The hook was part of a big machine that looked like a shabby old water pump.
And indeed there were a long arm and a hose coming out of the machine. Alessia just grabbed the end of the hose and ordered Jurij to start pumping.

He did as he was told and soon pressured water shot out from the hose. Without any warning Alessia aimed the water-jet at Jurij. The hitting water was so freezing that it felt like a thousand pricking needles on his naked skin.

Slowly the jet wandered down his chest and stomach until it nearly reached Jurij's crotch. Instinctively Jurij turned around, protecting his balls by his butt.

"Present me your front." Alessia gleefully chuckled.

"No please!"

"You better don't keep me waiting any longer, Jurij!" he was warned, her voice in a tone now, that assured him she meant it.

In deep despair Jurij looked at his ball-leash. It wouldn't be any problem for him to quickly take the loop from the hook and start running away now. But something deep inside him held him off.

His whole body was shaking in fear when he finally turned back to his front. He knew that the things that would come next wouldn't be pleasurable at all - but still he feared even more the things that would await him when he would defy Alessia now.

"Good, mal&#8217;chik! And now re-start pumping!"

It only took two more pushing of the pump arm until a new jet of cold water blasted on Jurij's unprotected crotch. The balls dragged against the firmly tightened leash and made Jurij moan out in pain.

"Don't dare to slow down pumping!" Alessia needed to encourage him, while she re-aimed the jet directly at his face until Jurij had to coughed and spit for every breath.

It should take two more endless minutes until Alessia finally aimed the jet down to the ground. Jurij's muscles were almost paralyzed by the frigid water, so that he was swaying a little when Alessia handed him a stiff bristled brush and soap.

"Clean yourself with this." she ordered him with a coldness in her voice that made him obey without any hesitation. Sobbing he began to gently run the bristles over his flesh.

"Wash like that." she ordered. Taking the hand in which he was holding the brush, she made him rake it hard and fast on his flesh. Each time causing searing pain.

Now that his hand had left the arm of the water pump, he tried to hug his trembling body. Inwardly Jurij wondered whether he was more trembling from cold or fear.
Therefore he didn't notice that Alessia had stepped forward and leaned forward to place a warm kiss on his head.

"Now that you've stopped stinking, I may touch you again!" she rejoiced.

Surprised by this sudden gesture of tenderness Jurij looked up into her shining eyes. But before he could reply any word, she already stepped back. Admiring the freezing shivers of his body she grinned at him mischievously.

"You're not cold, are you?" Alessia kept mocking his sufferings.

Jurij was now seriously considering to overpower his torturer. But suddenly her hands appeared behind her back, presenting him a fluffy towel.

"You want this?"

Jurij nodded.

"You can have it!" Alessia approved, only to draw back the treasured towel as soon as Jurij had reached for it.

"...after you have earned this towel! And the price of it would be a kiss on the top of my boots!"

Alessia teasingly folded up the furred collar of her uniform-coat as Jurij starred dumb-folded at her. Jurij couldn't believe what was happen to him. He considered to draw a final line here and stop to humiliate himself any longer. As he still didn't started to kneel down at Alessia's foot, Alessia aimed the hose back at his face.

"Once more?"

The prospect of another shower in this cold water crushed down the last bastions of Jurij's resistance.

"No more, please god no more..." he eagerly pleaded and knelt down at her feet.

As soon as his knees had touched the cold ground, Jurij cowardly gazed up at her.
"You better be careful. These boots are made of the most finest calfskin!"
With her arms folded over her breasts Alessia seemed to watch his inner struggles with nothing but sadistic enjoyment.
While Alessia's boots were indeed made of the softest leather, the heels and soles of the boots rested upon a solid platform and the round toecaps seemed to have been reinforced with steel.
A shudder ran down Jurij's spine as he thought about the frightening prospect of gaining a kick from one of them.&nbsp; So he just tightly shut his eyes and forced his head to lower over them. When his lips touched the soft and smooth surface of the boot, he could smell their overpowering fragrance of its leather. These boots must have been brand-new. Maybe Alessia had bought them especially to entice him? He might have lingered his lips on the boot a little too long, as Jurij heard Alessia's mischievous giggling from above.
�Is the sight of my boots making you nervous, Jurij? Maybe it helps if you stop just starring at them and start to show your devotion by kissing them instead?�
Jurij nodded his head, and he could feel his own arousal growing, even though he was cold, his cock was still getting rock hard. His balls on the other hand, almost hurt they were so cold.
But when he lowered his head to place a kiss on their smooth surface, Alessia suddenly retreated her boots.
�Wait &#8211; I think, it might be more appropriate for you to beg me for letting you kiss my boots first!�
Jurij's jaw dropped, and once again Alessia's delighted laughter rang out. But then her entire languid posture transformed into blazing, righteous indignation.
�I said beg me, mal'chik! Beg for the honor of your exalted Commandress&#8217; attentions!�
Jurij&#8217;s hammering heart actually started pounding away even louder than before. He remembered himself that his family was in real danger and that he still might need Alessia's help to rescue them. Confronted with the demon that had been unleashed within Alessia, this seemed easier said than done. But of course it was too late to back out now, Alessia would maintain her demanding, regal regard while he couldn't afford to loose any more time.
Jurij felt how his remaining resistance was collapsing while he dropped obediently into a position of shame-faced supplication.
�Please, Alessia. I beg you to take me back as your dedicated boyfriend and allow me to kiss your boots.�
Keeping his eyes properly down, Jurij listened for Alessia&#8217;s reaction with bated breath. He was literally weak in the knees here and as before a hot twinge of fear only enriched his excitement.
�Sweet!� Alessia drew out the silence an excruciating length, then spoke in a slow, musing tone. �But didn&#8217;t I hear you call me &#8216;Commandress&#8217; before? And swear to serve, worship, obey and adore me throughout all eternity? I want to hear all that again.�
Wholly caught up now, Jurij obeyed Alessia&nbsp; impeccably, forgetting his hallowed surroundings, his physically and emotionally exhausted state, banishing everything he&#8217;d seen and done and endured over the last few days.
�As my Commandress I'll place my fate into your hands. Please use my humble flesh and soul to your heart&#8217;s delight. I vow to devote all my skills and knowledge to satisfy your voracious needs.�
�Well said, my old, new boyfriend! Here's my boot for you to worship!�
Jurij has never kissed anything with more devotion. Later he would try to put the past into some kind of rational perspective that would somehow encompass the his recent weak acts &#8211; or even the loss of his freedom and relatives. But for now he was just going to go with the flow, allowing his amazingly strong and vital ex-girlfriend to take control and wring every last bit of ecstasy possible out of his sore, conflicted mind and body. Memories of grief, bloodshed and horror, along with guilt, regret and tortured introspection would have to wait until later.

Once Jurij lifted his head, Alessia threw the towel on the floor. After he had hastily dried off his wet body, the hose falls down beside him.

"Roll the hose back up, Jurij! And then let&#8217;s go back inside, where it is a little warmer.� came Alessia's harsh orders from above.
She removed the loop that was attaching his cock-leash to&nbsp; the fire pump and tugged slightly on it so that Jurij would follow. She walked into the main building, almost dragging him behind her. When they arrived inside, there were two more guards waiting. She smiled at them and said: �The prisoner and I will have a 'conversation' in my living quarters. I wish NOT to be disturbed!�
Alessia and Jurij continued their walk toward Alessia's quarters, when they were stopped once more by Nastasija. 
�What are you doing with that pathetic looking piece of imperialistic scum?� she asked Alessia, obviously trying to shame Jurij even more.
Alessia returned the question in the same disgusted tone Nastasija had used. �Why, I am taking him to teach him a lesson about the new balance of power in Russia. Now that he has been hosed down, I can teach him properly about certain advantages of communism.
"Do what you have to do! But please inform me as soon as you realize that this subject just can't be re-educated. I would love to help you to get rid of him!"
�I will! If you would excuse us for now?!�
Nastasija moved out of Alessia&#8217;s way, however, when Jurij stumbled along behind her, she took the opportunity to kick Jurij in the ass on his way by. He yelped like a scolded dog.
Nastasija walked away, obviously disgruntled. Alessia brought Jurij into her personal living quarters. Once inside the door, she closed it and raised her hand, the hand closest to him, as if she were going to greet someone, but instead of waving she turned to him and brought the back of her hand against his chest.

Her eyes were on him, curious, as if the gesture surprised her as much as it did him. Her touch was so unexpected and electrifying that he stood there for a moment not moving. Then he took her hand in his and lifted his gaze to her. Her lips were slightly parted and she was looking right into his eyes with that same, unsettling serenity and curiosity.&nbsp; She leaned forward ever so slightly, as did Jurij. Their lips touched, and then she slipped her tongue into his mouth, and they kissed passionately for several minutes. She broke away first, as she moved back, a tear filled one of Jurij&#8217;s eyes.

�First thing in the morning, we are leaving for your house. We will be spending some time there. Just the two of us - so that we can�shall we say manifest the new kind of relationship between each other a little.�
Alessia smiled at him and whispered: �But first I will require your services inside another room!�

Taking him by the hand she walked her new servant toward her sleeping quarters. When they reached the side of her bed, he was amazed, she had a four-post-bed, and the headboard contained several pieces of wood that had been decorated by a wood carver. Her linen was a crispy white color, with the scent of rose petals that Jurij could clearly smell.&nbsp; She had him kneel at her bedside and declared ceremoniously:

�I am going to take myself a hot shower�when I return, I expect you to be right here waiting for me. Oh - but first...� she said while she slipped her riding boots off her feet and placed them on the floor in front of him.

�You may polish my boots. There is apt to be many more opportunities for you to pay homage to my boots. In fact it will be your job to keep them clean. And by that I mean clean at every minute and without fail, Jurij! Should my boots get dirty, you will still be required to kiss them at my request.�

�Yes Commandress, as you wish.� Jurij replied &#8211; partly happy about the new chance of getting such an intimate access to Alessia, partly scared, because Alessia had so easily taken it for granted that he would accept the assigned job without even being asked.

While Jurij was still considering whether he liked the new, bossy way of Alessia or not, Alessia had already walked off into the bathroom and began to undress herself. He could see her reflection in the mirror and enjoyed very much watching her. His cock was still hard as a rock and had begun to seep a drop or two every now and then. He complied with her request and took a cloth and polished her boots. When she got out of the shower and dried herself off, she walked into the bedroom wrapped in just a towel.

�Jurij, will you help me with something?�

�What shall I do for you, Commandress?�

�I would like you to help me dry off. You may walk to me.�

He stood up and walked over to her. She handed him the towel she had wrapped around her and he began to dry her off, starting at the neck and working his way down the front and then up the back. When he had her dried off completely she smiled at him and teased: �I bet you would like a hot shower too, wouldn&#8217;t you?� 

He nodded his head.

�Well - let&#8217;s see what we can work out in trade. Would you eat my pussy, Jurij?�

The look on his face could only be described as horrified and humiliated. He started to stutter something but he just couldn't find the right words to explain. Alessia just looked at him, expressionless.
Then she inserted one of her fingers deep into her clitoris. When the finger was pulled out of her again, it was covered with her fresh juices. Slowly Alessia put this finger to Jurij's lips and gently parted them with it. He started to pull away as if to say something, but Alessia put the finger back to his lips as if to quiet him. She kept looking directly into his eyes.

"I think we need to talk here." she suddenly spoke out, before Alessia took her Jurij by the hand, led him to the bed and pushed him to sit down. Putting one leg on each side of him she maneuvered herself so that he could stare down at her very damp pussy lips.

"Would you prefer if I let Nastasija worship this glorious pussy instead of you?" she asked him. 
�Would you prefer Nastasija to taste me, to smell me, to be completely surrounded and subsumed in my cum as she brings me so much pleasure?�
 
At first Jurij just looked sheepishly back at her, but then he broke down: "No! Please no! Don't let her touch you like this! I'll pleasure you the best I can if you only promise not to let her lick you again!" 

As he spoke, Alessia removed her legs from around him, picked up a cigarette from the night-drawer and put it to her lips.

"I need the lighter and ashtray" she said and he looked at him as if to say "So fetch it for me!" which he promptly did.

"Aren't you going to light it for me?" ...of course he was! His hand was trembling as he lit her cigarette. Alessia inhaled deeply and blew the heavy stream of smoke directly into his face trying to pierce him with her eyes in a truly dominant way. With the cigarette in her hand, she began stroking his bare chest, gently pinching his right nipple. Noticing the intensity of his reaction, she casually took another drag from her cigarette and blew it toward his face. 

"You need to show me how much you love the taste and scent of me!" Alessia explained while she handed him the ashtray. Adjusting two pillows under her as a sat, she leaned back against the bed's headboard with her calves spread so that her little mal'chik would have unrestricted access to her pussy. 

His face went immediately and he began to explore her beautiful looking pussy with his tongue. 

After a moment of nervous hesitation Jurij placed the ashtray on the nightstand and laid down between her thighs, where he began to explore her beautiful looking pussy with his tongue. Alessia needed both hands to pull his head tightly into her. 
Now she could feel his tongue on her clitoris along with his warm breath as his nose was useless for breathing at that moment. ...and for many more moments to follow!
Soon she had discovered how to guide Jurij's face to reach even more exquisite places within her sex. Her efforts were rewarded by a maddeningly wonderful alternate sucking and licking of her pussy lips and clitoris.

Taking another drag of her cigarette, Alessia she spoke to him: "You seem to have a natural talent in pleasuring the most female part of a woman. Can it be that your surprising eagerness as my lover has something to do with your fear of getting replaced by Nastasija?"

His face reddened. "M... maybe..."

"She has really scared the hell out of you, hasn't she?" Alessia laughed. As Jurij had to pull his head up to answer her, she could use the opportunity to casually blew some smoke of down into his face.

"Yes, I'm afraid she has!"

"As long as you keep me happy, I promise to protect you from her! So that's one more good reason for you to do everything you can not to disappoint me again, isn't it?�

She continued to hold his head and his gaze as she took one more drag from her cigarette. She extinguished it in the ashtray, blowing the last bit of smoke into his face.

�And now you better get on with your job!" Alessia ordered before her hands forced him back into her pussy.. 

Soon she felt the familiar feelings of impending orgasm of the magnitude. She tried to draw him even deeper into her, but somehow she would need more than just the tender pressure of his lips. �Roll over onto your back!� 

Jurij was speechless but still did as he was told. She moved above him so that she now was facing his feet. Then she&nbsp; lowered her pussy onto his face, enveloping him within her. Alessia was literally dripping from my pussy by this point as she began to feel that savage animal within her again. She wanted to fuck his entire body as if it were a giant cock. while he struggled within her. Alessia was turned on by the thought that at this moment her mal'chik was utterly&nbsp; drowning within her sex. He still would please her to his last breath if that's what she would demand of him. His body was completely dedicated to her exclusive pleasure. 

Then, without warning, her orgasm hit her. An orgasm beyond anything she had ever felt before. But she still kept up pumping his nose into her pussy and soon was driven to another mind-blowing orgasm. She had become nothing but a lusty animal by now. ...an animal in heat that came three times!

She felt the desire for another cigarette as Alessia tried to catch her breath. She took out a cigarette and began to smoke casually as she laid there just resting from what had happened.
All the time Jurij kept just looking at his new Commandress with endearing hungry eyes. Getting the picture that he wanted nothing more than to please her, Alessia began to wonder how far he would go. 

She rolled toward him slightly and looked directly into his eyes. Then she slowly reached down between her legs and slid two fingers into her wet pussy. She crooked her fingers slightly and withdrew with them a glob of her sweet juices. 

"Open your mouth" she ordered as she raised her hand over his face. 
After looking into her eyes with reluctance, Jurij's lips dutifully parted a little. Alessia still seized the opportunity to slid her fingers inside. She slid them in so far that Jurij nearly needed to gag but he didn't. In fact he sucked her fingers like a baby goat sucking on its mother's teats.

"Not so fast, mal'chik. You may catch it all, but I want you to hold it in your mouth until I tell you to swallow." 

It took a couple of seconds until the taste of her juices had fully occupied every part of his throat.

"Okay, you can swallow now." 

Alessia took another drag off her cigarette and blew a thick stream of smoke into his face. His helpless coughing caused even more stirring in her loins. So she casually pressed her cigarette between her two lips and reached up to forcefully grab him by the hair and to pull his face inexorably down to her clitoris. With both hands she held it there until he started to struggle for some breath. She loved to see him struggle to suppress his very need for oxygen so that he could continue to please her. It made her feel so desired, so worshiped.

He licked, sucked and probed her pussy once more while Alessia laid down finishing her cigarette.

She definitely had passed the point of feeling squeamish about the feeling of his tongue and nose inside her sex.
Alessia realized that by becoming dominant, she was setting Jurij free. She saw that he wanted to worship a woman's body in ways which he had been too afraid to admit during his whole life-time, but that he nevertheless needed to feel complete.
And Alessia knew that she was the only women who could give him what he needed, because she gave it to him and let him feel good about it. She let him know that all those things he wanted to have a woman do to him, she wanted just as much. And by that she realized that her little mal'chik would always be completely loyal to her.

As tired as she had become by now, Alessia felt needing at least one more orgasm before she could sleep. So she pushed her Jurij off the bed and down onto the floor. Putting her leg over him, she scooted up and straddled his face. 

"You really need to clean that juices out of my pussy so I can go to sleep. Open up." 

He opened his mouth and her swollen, dripping pussy instantly lowered over his face.

�You feel like being a slave to my pussy now, don't you?" 

Alessia slid her pussy back and forth over his face as she began to feel another orgasm approaching. She let all of her weight settle on his face as she tried to get his nose even deeper in her sex. The closer she got, the more roughly she twisted his nipples - enjoying&nbsp; the feeling of him squirming beneath her in the mixture of pain and pleasure.

He began to beat if furiously as she ground the pussy harder into his face. His nose was literally buried inside her pussy. Alessia knew at this point that he absolutely could not breathe. He squirmed trying to get some air. But at that point Alessia didn't care whether he can breathe or not. All she cared was her need to cum and nothing no one else mattered. Fortunately for Jurij,her next orgasm exploded over her just at this time. When the orgasm passed, his face was deep red, as were his poor nipples, and he was choking on the amount of fluid that came out of her. Just then Alessia had the presence of mind to reach down and grab his hard cock.

�That was wonderful, Jurij. You have definitely earned yourself the promised hot shower.�

Jurij couldn't answer her, as he was still trying to catch his breath both from being smothered beneath his beautiful Commandress.

�But of course the privilege of a hot shower doesn't include the privilege of touching your penis more the necessary! Your penis fully belongs to me now and I will be right here waiting for him.� she stated as she rolled off his face, careful to keep holding his penis firmly inside her hand.

�Am I understood?�

He nodded his head, almost not believing his own ears.

�Good! Then go ahead and take your shower!�

Jurij was totally torn, he desperately wanted a hot shower, but he didn&#8217;t want to leave Alessia&#8217;s bedside. He felt everything leaving his mind except for thoughts of making her happy and hearing those moans of passion come from her tender lips. He so desperately wanted to hear those noises again, however, he didn&#8217;t want to anger her either, so he tore himself away and said �Thank you Commandress for allowing me the privilege of using your shower as well as the honor of worshiping your pussy.�

�You are welcome! ...and I thank you for doing such a wonderful job of worshiping my pussy. Now go take your shower before I change my mind.�

He immediately got up and headed to the bathroom and began to shower. Oh how nice the hot water felt on his skin and the soap that she had in her shower, smelled so good. He was oblivious to the amount of time he spent in the shower.&nbsp; When he was finished, he got out and dried off. Only to find his beautiful Alessia sound asleep on the bed.&nbsp; He didn&#8217;t want to wake her, she looked so breathtaking, lying there, naked. He softly and gently climbed onto the bed, and slept at her feet.









[ WHAT A BEAUTIFUL MORNING ]
When Jurij awoke at the next morning, it took him a moment to realize where he was.
"Well it&#8217;s about time to get up, sleepy head!" he was told by a soft, yet firm voice. As his eyes wandered to the source of the voice, he looked into the radiant face of Alessia. She was already up and dressed.
So he got up and went to the chair &#8211; getting his yesterday's cloths. He was just taking his underwear when he heard her determinant voice: "Put it back!�
Appalled he dropped the underwear and turned around. Alessia's charming smile was gone, instead she had folded her arms which gave he an even more rigorous look. Seeing his confusion she went forward, stopping right in front of him. She look him straight into the eyes, which had a quite scaring effect upon him.
�After last night some things between us are going to be a little different. As my new boyfriend I expect you to be unclothed at all times when you are alone with me! It will make you more vulnerable and always remind you that it's me who controls your body.�
What am I getting myself into, Jurij thought to himself. Listening to her speak like this was already making his cock get hard, and by now he knew better than to not fulfill her wishes without question. And after all he felt that his resistance had already been too crumpled by Alessia's beguiling beauty. When he finally nodded in acceptance, a smile returned on Alessia's face. She kissed him hard on his lips while her fingers pinched his cheek.
"Thank you!"
Slowly she grabbed his chin with her hand. The smile on her face began to get a cruel somehow, as she whispered �Jurij, I want you to look me into my eyes and tell me something!�

When she was convinced to have his full attention, she continued �Did you relieve yourself in the shower last evening while thinking of me?�

Her eyes drilled right through him. But without batting an eye, he spoke honestly, �No Commandress, I did not.�

She smirked and said: �My little mal&#8217;chik has pleased me. Thank you for your honesty, I am in hopes that I shall never have to punish you for lying. I will know, by your face, if ever you do.�

Uncertain what to say, Jurij just nodded at her.

�Still you owe me big time for sleeping that long in this morning.� 

"Your wishes will be my commands!" he said in a cheerful, jesting way.

�Well then, Jurij. I think for some compensation I want you to kneel at my feet and kiss my toes.�

Obediently he dropped to his knees and began to perform that task. Immediately Alessia could see that kissing her toes was turning Jurij on once more. What an odd but amazing effect! She couldn't claim that she fully understood it, but it was definitely something she could use to her advantage.

After a few minutes of watching him worship her feet, Alessia began to realize that it was not just kissing her feet that turned Jurij on. It was the fact that she "forced" him to do what he had secretly wanted.

She felt simultaneously sad for him, that he had spent his life tortured by this secret, and exhilarated as a felt butterflies in her stomach. She felt protective over this man while at the same time feeling more and more dominant. 
Suddenly she spoke again: �Now open your mouth Jurij, and place all of my toes into your mouth.�

He tried to accommodate all of her toes, but kept unsuccessful. He looked up her with a worried look on his face.

�I am sorry Commandress &#8211; I just cannot.�

She looked displeased and she said �You can! And you will! Go lie on the sofa and place your head at the edge, so it is tipped back. Move quickly or I shall become angry.�

She placed her toes by his mouth and quietly stated: �If my little mal&#8217;chik ever wants to put something into my mouth, he damn well better take what I give him to put in his mouth. Now open wider!�

He opened his mouth as wide as he could and she shoved her toes toward the back of his throat. She began to withdraw and insert her foot rather quickly, literally fucking his mouth with her foot. Each insertion went a little deeper, he was gagging and unable to breathe, but she continued not allowing time for him to catch his breath or relax his throat.

�WHEN I TELL YOU TO DO SOMETHING, MY LITTLE MAL&#8217;CHIK YOU DAMN WELL BETTER DO IT!�

She removed her right foot, allowed him a moment. Then she began again with the left foot, raping his throat with each insertion of her foot into his mouth. This foot, however, went in a little easier. His cock was rock hard, so she knew he was enjoying being punished this way. She stopped what she was doing and walked away for a few minutes, when she arrived back she smiled at Jurij and said: �OPEN WIDE.�

He opened his mouth and the toe of one of her oldest, most worn-out boots was stuffed into his mouth and down his throat. Alessia used a slim leather belt to secure the boot firmly to his head.

�I have to attend an assembly of the regional Soviet [=Council] now. But I will be back soon and in the meantime I want you to keep that boot in your mouth, thinking of me.�

With that she headed to the door. "Ah &#8211; and before I forget it: There is an armed guard posted outside the door, who might protect you from Nastasija. But remember: The guard is also going to keep you away from trying something silly, like running away or something. I expect an extra strong cup of coffee for the time I come back!" Jurij was ordered.
Then the door was closed and she was gone. Alessia hadn't even looked for Jurij's affirmation of her order anymore. He had become her dumb servant already. And indeed Jurij instantly walked into the kitchen to make some coffee, still very embarrassed at this point to be walking around totally naked and with a shoe sticking out of his mouth.&nbsp; However completely turned on, by what had just happened.

Once the coffee was made, he waited for her to return. She was gone for what seemed like hours. When Alessia finally arrived back, she seemed upset.
�Get dressed and ready to leave, Jurij! We are headed to your family's house.� was all she said to him.&nbsp; She walked over to him and took the boot out of his mouth and told him to be sure to pack it and went to get her cup of coffee.
Jurij began to dress and then he finally mustered up the courage to ask �Commandress, have I done something to upset you.�

She tried to smile at him and said �No, my little mal&#8217;chik, you have not.�

�Then why does your face look so upset? Please tell me what I can do to make you smile.�

�I think my boots deserve to be worshiped by some more kisses. You may take care of that as soon as you have finished dressing.�

So she waited patiently for Jurij to dress and then she stuck her foot out for him. He dropped down to his knees in front of her and kissed the top of the right boot in silent devotion. Soon Jurij smelled nothing but the powerful scent of its leather. Then came the left one. Wondering what he would do, if she makes the task more difficult for him, Alessia lifted her boot a little.&nbsp; Instinctively Jurij reached out to grab the boot, only to get immediately kicked by it one second later. He removed his hands and began to kiss only without touching with his hands.&nbsp; Every now and then she would move her foot and giggle a little as he stumbled.
But this little teasing didn't bother him. The only thing that counted for Jurij was the fact that he had put back the smile of Alessia's face.

�Thanks for cheering me up! But now we really got to leave!�

She had already packed a suitcase in the morning, so all Jurij had to do was carry her suitcase while he followed along behind her.

When they reached the stables, Jurij realized there was no horse left for him.

�Where is my horse?�

�Sorry! But it got seized by the local Cavalry unit of the Red Army!�

�...but...how am I going back to my family's house then?�

�You'll have to walk I'm afraid. This way you won't be able to run away from me &#8211; after all you are formally still my prisoner! And now get my horse ready!�

While he began to care for her horse, she watched his every move. Both of them knew that at this moment Jurij could have easily jumped on the back of Alessia's horse and ride away.
But something deep inside Jurij's mind kept him from trying to escape.
That was the time when he realized that he loved Alessia so much that he couldn't bear to lose her again. And if that meant him being humiliated and degraded, so be it. It is a strange feeling to explain and an even stranger rationale to understand. But knowing that by submitting Alessia would 1) be happy and 2) would still be in his life, his fate was cast; the deal was sealed.

The ride to the farm was peaceful for Alessia, it allowed her time to think about what she was going to do and how she was going to handle this situation�She really wanted to allow Jurij to put his beautiful cock in her pussy, however, she knew she needed to hold out on that as long as she could. She considered the probable impact of the decisions that had been made by the Soviet's assembly she had just attended. She realized that there would be a lot of work to do in order to show that Jurij's �re-education� program was working out, when she would return with him in two weeks. She decided that she must really want this, if she allowed Nastasija to assume her rank in her absence.

�What is your job within the Red Army?� her thoughts suddenly got interrupted by Jurij.

Her voice sharpened into a cutting edge, and she slashed at him with it. �Address me properly, mal'chik! Then maybe I&#8217;ll consider your contemptible question.�
�I am sorry. May I ask about the job you hold within the Red Army, Commandress?�
�Plainly it's just holding this town for the Red Army and wipe out all hostile activities.�

�And what is Nastasija's job then, Commandress?�

�Basically the same!�

�So you are competitors?�

�Stop asking too many questions, my mal'chik! Well &#8211; I still guess I should better share some things with you: One result of my meeting at this morning had been, that I have two weeks to convert you into a good communist. At this point your fate, lies in your own hands. If you are able to be re-educated, I will be permitted to keep you at my command &#8211; or shall I better say: at my feet. But if you should proof yourself not being able to convert, I must watch you die at the hand of Nastasija. If Maximow is not able to find your cousin, he will be coming here to punish you for lying to Nastasija and myself, you saw how your father was punished for lying. IF there is more, now would be the time to speak up.�

�I have told you the truth as to their whereabouts, Commandress!�

"Good for you! But now I have a question for you in return. Why didn't it seem to bother you that I haven't done anything so that you could relieve yourself?"

That was a tricky question! Jurij thought about trying to explain Alessia that he wasn't perverse, that he had no interest in pain, that he just felt the need to have a woman like her "take him" sexually, to force him to please her, to take all responsibility for her own pleasure so that for once he'd know that he could please a woman, that he could give her exactly what she wanted and be sure of it because she was taking exactly what she wanted with no regard for his pleasure. He could try to explain Alessia that knowing he'd pleased a woman like her completely and thoroughly would let him enjoy his own pleasure like nothing else ever had. But when Jurij finally lifted his head to give his answer, he said just four little words: "Because I love you!".
Alessia just laughed softly and gave her mal'chik a gracious pat on the head.




[ A DEVASTATING DISCOVERY ]

When they arrived at the house, the whole estate was utterly burnt down to the grounds.

�W... what.....� Jurij only stuttered in shock.

Alessia on the other hand knew that her rationality was mostly needed at this moment. Who could have done this? 

�Oh this damn Nastasija!� she quietly cursed into the emptiness of the scene.

Jurij began to cry out: �Nastasija?... Nastasija???&nbsp; But �you��

�I what?� Alessia asked back in innocent surprise while she swung her body down from the saddle.

�You were supposed to protect my property!� Jurij shouted.

�Your property?� she shouted back - obviously annoyed.

�... as far as I remember this property belonged to the Red Army since the last few days &#8211; and not to you anymore.�

�W... What? That's bull-shit! This estate had belonged to my family for centuries. It can't be just taken by a....�

Out of a sudden Jurij's protest got interrupted by a load W-H-A-P. Then he felt the sharp sting of her riding crop through the thin sleeve of his coat.

He starred at her in astonishment. Alessia's full lips had drawn into a tight line of anger and she closed her eyes for a moment; when she opened them again, they were sparkling in anger.

Through her clenched white teeth she hissed: �You better shut up right now!� 

Intimidated by this sudden outburst, Jurij could only look down and mumble a quite �Yes, Commandress.�

�Fine! So instead of starting accusing each other, we better go and see what the heck happened.�

As they got around the burnt ruins of the former stable building, they were greeted by the horrible sight of hanging corpses. Three pitiful fellows had been sent to the gallows here. One of them carried a sign saying �I have betrayed the glorious nation of Russia by co-operating with the Red Army!� around his neck.

�Who are these poor men?� Jurij wondered aloud.

�Probably just innocent citizen who had the bad luck to be at the wrong place at the wrong time. And now they have become the latest victims of General Denikin's regime. That means that his White troops must finally have arrived in this area! It is only typical for them that they immediately start mass executions and plunder.�

�General Denikin? Who is he?�

�You don't know General Denikin???�

�N... no...!� Jurij stammered.

�You really are just a naive little mal'chik, aren't you?�

�Well...after all I have been in German war imprisonment for the last months�

�Come on &#8211; there is no way you can excuse your lousy political knowledge. Anton Ivanovich Denikin has be maybe one of the most important Generals in the Russia's imperialistic war against Germany. In 1916 he was appointed to command the VIII Corps and lead troops in Romania during the Brusilov Offensive.

Following our Great Socialistic Revolution last year Denikin and some other Tsarist officers formed the counter-revolutionary Volunteer Army. As our brave troops have killed the first commander of the Volunteer Army, the forces came under his command. By now Denikin must be around 45 years old and his men are becoming bolder each day.

�But why should his troops burn down our estate?� Jurij wondered aloud.

He only got himself mercilessly mocked by Alessia: �Why? Why??? How about: 'To terrorize the region!' ? Or 'To destabilize our progress in forming a Socialistic society!' ? You definitely are not that naive, are you, mal'chik?� 

�But... My family is neutral. We haven't done anything to anyone. Why have the picked our estate to burn down?�

�Why don't you catch one of his soldiers and ask him yourself?� Alessia replied in a very sarcastic tone.

�Maybe I should better go back to my family and tell them! Now that our whole estate is burnt down, there is nothing left for me to protect here anyway.�

�You still haven't realized that you are nothing but my prisoner by now, have you?�

�...but ...but they are still my family! I must tell them, Alessia!�

Jurij didn't see it coming when her right gloved hand cut him off with a sudden slap to his face. It left his head spinning and his left cheek feeling swollen and red.

�Stop arguing with me!� Alessia shouted at him and viciously slapped his other cheek with a backhanded sweep of the same hand. This time Jurij almost lost his balance but managed to recover just in time to keep position. Anxiously biting his lower lip he could taste a little of his blood. 

�All you have 'must' do is following my orders. Beside: Wasn't it your family that haven't accepted me as your girlfriend? Why should I give a shit about them now!?�

�...but...dear Alessia� Please!�

�There is no 'dear Alessia' for you anymore! I am your Commandress. I know that you have enjoyed to be bossed around by me so far. Actually I think it's sweet that you still have devotee feelings for me. But now it is time to realize that this isn't a game. And definitely it is not your game! You are a prisoner of the Red Army hold in my personal custody and therefore it is only me who decides over your destiny. All you'll have to think of is listening to the things I ask from you to do. And then you will have to fulfill every of my commands eagerly whether you enjoy them or not. You better start to accept that very quickly if you don't want to get seriously hurt by me.�

Desperately Jurij looked out for a glimmer of hidden irony in her dark eyes. He didn't find any. She was serious. God-damn-serious! Confused by all the new thoughts rushing through his mind, Jurij didn't resisted when Alessia grabbed him by the arm and pulled him close to her.

�Our relationship is going to make rapid changes during troubled times like these. I don't have a clue where our common journey will end, but I want you to know that I really enjoy being your Commandress. I love you to be mine!&nbsp; As long as you stay loyal to me and obey my orders, I promise to take care of you and protect you the best I can. BUT you need to understand that I won't let you free ever again. If you really should find a way to escape from me, I will hunt you down without mercy. And then I will take care that you get executed by the rules of the Red Army.�

Jurij was overwhelmed by the impact of her words. Alessia had just confessed her new-found love towards him, hadn't she? The confession of love that he had craved for so much during the last days!
It made his cock twitch to hear her speaking like that. And as it was his cock and not his brain that was controlling his thoughts at this moment, Jurij heard himself answering: �Whatever you might demand from me, I promise to stay with you.�

Alessia's beautiful lips curled into a gleeful smirk of triumph.

�Good! Then we will now forget about all this non-sense of informing your family. Instead we will go back to Yekaterinodar to report the Red Army about the appearance of White forces in this region. But first I want you to undress your shoes.�

�My shoes?�

�Yeah. Without your shoes, you can't run too fast. And so you won't be able to run away from me, even when the time comes when you regret your decision to stay with me!�

Jurij needed all his self-control to repress his rising sarcasm. After all there hasn't been much of a decision for him to make, has there? But the more Jurij though of the prospect to walk the whole way to Yekaterinodar without shoes, the more his inner sarcasm got replaced by fear.

�But we are in the woods! The ground is wet and rocky.�

Alessia just stood still and motionlessly watched how terror and nervousness raised rapidly up his Jurij's eyes.

�That's not my problem, is it?� she smiled cruelly at him.

�Beside: such a little suffering might help you to understand that the control over your comfort and discomfort is mine now.�

Without loosing another word, Jurij unlaced his shoes and pulled out his feet.

�And now take down one of the hanged people and handle me the rope he was hanged with!�

Jurij couldn't believe her disrespectful order. But he had finally accepted that his believes and disbelieves didn't matter anymore. So he once more did what he was ordered.

Alessia took the rope from his hands and bound Jurij with his arms folded up behind his back. After she had convinced herself from the firmness of her knots, she mounted her horse and ordered:
�Now let's go! But travel careful to stay quiet: When the White Army find us with me wearing a Red Army's uniform, we are both dead.�
With that she slightly kicked her boots into her horse. Forcing her horse to trot directly towards her bound and sock-footed prisoner, she effectively impelled Jurij to start walking.
As expected it didn't take very long until Jurij had stepped into a puddles and his feet got painfully cold inside the wet socks. After only ten minutes of marching in front of Alessia's horse, Jurij's socks got its first holes. Now the bare soles of Jurij's feet had to step without any protection on the stones and sticks of the road. The wind picked up and it began pouring. The dirt of the road turned into mud. 
Still Jurij didn't dare to complain about his hurting feet. His mind had finally accepted the absolute irrevocability of Alessia's iron will. She had truly turned into his ultimate Commandress by now.
They were still more than five kilometers away from the Yekaterinodar when Jurij and Alessia discovered dark smoke rising at the horizon. The city of Yekaterinodar was burning!
Anxiously they further approached the city until they could make out the outlines of a check-point of Denikin's Volunteer Army. The unbelievable seemed to have happened: Yekaterinodar had fallen under the power of White forces. Now the poor people of the socialist city would have to face Denikin's revenge &#8211; and that would surely involve the horror of mass executions and plunder.
�So where will we go next, now that both of us have lost our home to the White Army?� asked Jurij in uncontrolled cynicism.

�The Red Army might have lost a battle here, but definitely not the war! Beside we haven't lost everything to the White Army: Fortunately there is still this!� Alessia declared, holding up his diary.
�In this book you mention an ominous 'Thinking spot' close to Yekaterinodar. Where is it exactly?� 

Jurij looked shocked: So Alessia knew all about the 'Thinking spot'. Still he didn&#8217;t really want to take her there as this spot held to much memories of his love-sickness that he had fought there before the Great War broke out...

�There won't be much left to see anymore!�

�We will only know what's left to see there, when we go and check it out!�

�But I haven&#8217;t been there in a very long time.�

�How long, Jurij?�

�Since the night you quite physically told me that our relationship would be over.�

Alessia smiled at him as she remembered this crucial day herself. At this day she had slapped his face 'quite physically'.

�I want you to take me to this 'Thinking spot'!�

�But it's a very personal place for me!�

�Haven't we already agreed on the fact that I am in charge of your privacy now?�

He knew he didn&#8217;t have much of a choice left. So he went forward and showed Alessia the way to this secret place.

Soon they reached an old broken-down shack: they have arrived! Alessia dismounted her horse and grabbed into the saddlebag. In the next moment she took out a dangerously gleaming knife that caused an uncomfortable feeling inside Jurij's stomach. Alessia glanced at him and smirked.

Suddenly he was pushed around and the rope that had tied him up so tautly was sliced apart with a swift but controlled flick of her wrist. Before Jurij had even realized that his hands were free again, Alessia had stepped back to his front and handed him the horse's harness. He took it in blind obedience and began to secure her horse to a hitching post.
When his job was done, he finally followed Alessia into the so very well-known shack. 
Inside it was as pleasantly snug and dry as it has always been in the past. An old oil-lamp lit the small room, illuminating his sweet Alessia who had found a relaxing place on a wooden box covered with hay. Jurij remembered how he had sat on this box during the endless hours of love-sickness he had felt for Alessia. That was four years ago, but still it felt like yesterday.
It felt so strange to realize that the woman of his desires was now being in this unholy 'thinking sot' herself.

Jurij just couldn't stop peeking at her out of the corner of his eye, silently admiring her neat waist and high proud breasts. Being at his old 'thinking spot' with her let all the memories of the past flood back into his head.
Suddenly there was a loud crack of thunder. One moment later heavy rain started to pound mercilessly against the roof.

�I guess we better stay here for the night. Tomorrow we will march southwards and try to catch up with the unit of Major Vladimir Maximow. They will probably re-organize themselves around the city of Saratovskaya. As Saratovskaya is around 50 kilometers away we might have to walk for two days. � Alessia declared while she lazily removed her riding gloves, one finger at a time.

Jurij didn't really care for tomorrow! His mind was transfixed on the sight of how the damp white fabric of Alessia's blouse clang to her skin. So he only nodded in agreement with her plan and hung his wet coat on a nail on the wall - just beside Alessia's sodden jacket that was already hanging there. 

When he returned to Alessia, he was greeted by her stretched out legs.

"Well, I am afraid my boots got filthy during the day. Come and assist me, my little mal'chik." 

Jurij went over to her and began to wipe her boots with some hay that lay on the ground. 

"Stop! That will never do!" she scolded. "You'll have to take them off first."

Nervously Jurij straddled her right leg, grasped the heel and began tugging. Alessia smirked down at him when she planted the sole of her other booted foot against his chest and shoving hard. Her right boot suddenly came loose and Jurij felt into the straw. Embarrassed, he scrambles at his feet, but as started to rise Alessia shouted: �S T A Y !" 

What could he do? He stayed - on all fours like a pet-animal.

With a mischievous grin on her face, Alessia slowly lifted her muddy left boot until its sole was pointing right at his fact.

�I want you to undo my next boot while kneeling at my feet!�

Before Jurij could even agree, Alessia had already planted her stockinged right foot firmly on Jurij's shoulder. His hands shook slightly when they grabbed the remaining boot and carefully removed it from her foot.

Alessia looked down at her eager mal'chik and smiled to herself. The sight of Jurij having fallen for her was priceless.

�Good! And now I expect you to polish my boots properly. But don't take just hay from the ground &#8211; it will only scratch the exclusive leather of my boots. They require the use of some soft cloth! Like your shirt for example!�

It took Jurij's only a short moment before his desire to obey Alessia won the mental battle over his remained dignity. After a silent nod Jurij removed his shirt and wrapped its cloth around his finger. Still kneeling bare-chested in front of Alessia, he started buffing both boots to a deep shine.
He did his work with utter dedication as the rich smell of the leather that kept him excited over the whole time.

�That's enough! Now put them back on for me.� Alessia commanded after a while. 

Feeling how Alessia's calves slid easily into the firm leather of the riding boots only increased Jurij's inner excitement. As he was finally finished
, Alessia casually moved the sole of her right boot between his open knees, barely touching his groin. An enormous thrill coursed through Jurij. He had an overwhelming desire to move himself a little forward so that his groin would rub against the boot. The very thought of it made his penis swell already. Surely Alessia would notice! But how would she react? Would she allow him to act such needy in her presence?
In a desperate attempt to hide his arousal, he looked up to check her mood. Thank goodness: she was smiling at him!

�You quite enjoyed polishing my boots, didn't you?� she even laughed back.

�I did!� Jurij confirmed honestly, while his mind got deeper and deeper lost in the beauty of her smile.

He realized that he still desired her like crazy - beside all her new aura of bossiness. In fact her new aura of bossiness somehow made him desire her even more.
And hadn't Alessia just confessed to him that she loved to be his Commandress. So she still holds tender feelings for him. There was still a chance that she would fall in love with him again, Jurij dared to dream.

�What's that lustful look on your face?� his thought got interrupted out of a sudden.

�Em... What? A lustful look?� 

�Don't try to fool me, mal'chik!� Alessia grinned at him. 

�You would like to kiss me on my sweet lips now, am I right?�

�Em...� Jurij only managed to say as he felt the touch of her boot against his groin. The heavy leather of its toe pressed through his trousers against the ever hardening bulge in his underpants.

�AM I RIGHT?� Alessia kept pushing him for an answer.

�Yes...I would!� he replied, fighting to get his voice under control, while his stomach was churning with a maelstrom of emotions.

Slowly his body leaned forward, graving for the promised kiss. But then Alessia lifted her leg and effectively stopped his approach by placing the sole of her boot on his shoulder.

�Oh what a pity.� she cruelly laughed at him. �I am afraid that I can't let a prisoner kiss my lips. Sorry, but my lips are exclusively reserved for lovers. And you are hardly in the position to be my lover anymore, are you?�
Alessia mocked in mischievous amusement while she let her tongue run over her red lips to tease him even more.

It took Jurij a few moments to realize what kind of cruel games Alessia was playing with his unfulfilled desires. His silly hopes that Alessia's former confession that she would love him to be hers would mean that she also would love to have him back as her boyfriend pulverized within this moment. They were replaced by the feeling of empty disappointment.

�But you know what?�

�Yeah?� he cheered up &#8211; instantly hoping for a new chance of a kiss!

�I like you to grave for my kisses &#8211; even if they have become unreachable for you. So I want you to close your eyes and just think of my sweet lips!�

What? Graving in front of her for something that she wouldn't give him anyway was just ridicules. He might be her prisoner but he surely wouldn't let Alessia make him her brainless addict. No - he would gather his remaining will-power and refuse to close his eyes, Jurij told himself

Noticing his sudden resistance, Alessia's smile started to freeze. 

�Mal'chik! If you don't want to play, maybe you are more useful working. At first you will fix this hole there in the roof! The sweeping raindrops are pissing me off!� she barked at him.

Alarmed by Alessia's sudden anger, responded without daring to protest. Ignoring the heavy rain hailing down against his naked chest, he went out to fetch the large iron plate that was standing at the backside of the shack. A couple of minutes later he had fixed it over the hole in the roof. The rain slowly wore off, so he even started to gather some wood for the fire. In fact he was quite happy about this little extra-work as it gave him the time he needed to think about Alessia's recent outburst. 
Jurij realized that his response of defiance when he wouldn't close his eyes for her had crossed a line that he shouldn't have crossed. Immediately he started to regret his stupid resistance. But it was too late now. He knew that he would have to work very hard to weaken Alessia's anger. He silently pleaded that she wouldn't make him to suffer too much.

But when he finally went back inside the shack, Alessia was gone! Where the hell was she?
What Jurij couldn't know at this moment was that Alessia had use the opportunity of being alone to look around a little.

That was when she found the tree, that Jurij was hoping was long gone�but there it stood, with a big heart and 'J.A. ljublit A.V.' [= 'J.A. Loves A.V.'] carved into it. She smiled looking at that. 
She now had found another sweet proof that Jurij had always loved her. Probably more than everything in his little world. And he loved her still! That was good. Alessia loved to be loved! But it annoyed her that Jurij was still just obeying her orders when he liked to obey them. And he had even shouted at her at the burnt-down estate of his family. She could hardly return his tenderness as long as he remained so disobediently, could she? Definitely not if she wanted to hold unlimited control over him. So she would need to find ways that effectively bridled his stubborn character, Alessia thought to herself. That was the moment when the �beast� inside her was coming out.
And then it made click &#8211; she had suddenly found the way to break the stubbornness of her little mal'chik. She just had to try this.

Jurij's job to fix the roof wouldn't take long enough for her to complete her preparations, so Alessia went back to the shack. Jurij was already sitting inside &#8211; waiting for her return without having the slightest suspicion.

As soon as he saw her, he stood up and spoke quietly asking �Commandress, what shall I do now?�

Alessia had to smirk at his eagerness. He even called her by the title &#8216;Commandress&#8217; instead of just &#8216;Alessia&#8217;! Surely he was stung by a guilty conscience. But it was too late to make amends for it now. She wouldn't spare him being taught a painful lesson.

She looked at him, smiling sweetly and spoke just as quietly as he did: �Let&#8217;s see: you have already collected enough wood for the evening! That is great! But we also will need some water up here to wash with. Go to the stream just over the bank and fetch us a bucket of water!�

�As you wish.�

He began to walk away and she spoke up �Jurij, when you get back, I want this place cleaned up and made suitable for me to sleep in. There is a blanket in my things, you may place that on the bed when you are completely finished cleaning this place up. Don&#8217;t disappoint me, I will be back soon.�

�But where will you�� 

�Don&#8217;t concern yourself with my whereabouts!� she interrupted him, not allowing him to finish his questions. �You only have to worry about NOT DISAPPOINTING ME AGAIN.�

�Yes Commandress.� was all that he replied with. Her secretiveness felt humiliating. But for some reason, it was also strangely exciting to be unsure what would happen behind his back, what it was Alessia wanted to do without him knowing. Confused by all these contradictory emotions Jurij rushed away to complete the tasks she asked him to perform.

As soon as Jurij was out of sight, Alessia walked out and got out her little knife from the saddlebag. Then she went back to the tree, to finish what she started. 

The rose bush beside the tree that had long since died had left nasty thorns behind, which she had considered leaving there, however she decided this would be better. She kept one fairly sturdy branch out in case he gave her a hard time. When she had completed all of her preparations she stood back and looked around, smiling at her accomplishments.

Jurij was still busy sweeping some old leaves out of the shack when he felt being watched from behind. Casually leaning against the door frame, Alessia was silently observing his work.
When he looked into her eyes, she presented him one of her most infamous grins.

�Are you finished in there, Jurij?�

�I nearly am!�

�Good! Then grab me my jacket and come out here please.�

Thinking to himself, if it&#8217;s cold enough out there that Alessia wants her jacket, why must I go out half-naked? He chose wisely in not mentioning his inner disagreement with Alessia&#8217;s obvious double-standard.

When they reached her horse, she grabbed a couple pieces of rope and smiled at him: �Would you carry that for me as well, please?�

Then he noticed that she was leading him to his special tree. The one with the big heart and 'J.A. ljublit A.V.' [= 'J.A. Loves A.V.'] carved into it. His face changed into a brilliant shade of red when they finally arrived.

�Now kneel up against the tree so that you are facing it.�

Jurij slumped to his knees and she silently thanked god she had guessed correctly and everything was lined up. The tree was just a few centimeters off now, with one sturdy-looking branch remaining on the shattered trunk.

�Place your hands above your head.� 

His arms went up. With no warning nor ceremony, she tied his wrists together, tossed the rope over the higher branch and pulled until his arms got firmly lifted. After she had secured the rope back around the trunk, Alessia walked behind him. Her hands grabbed around his belly and unbuckled his belt. Then Jurij&#8217;s trousers got yanked straight down to his knees.

"What are you doing?!?" he protested in shock.

"You don&#8217;t need to know that now!" she snapped "...but I can guarantee that you deserve every little step of it! And now I want you to shut up and kiss the word &#8216;ljublit&#8217;, Jurij.�

As soon as his lips touched the tree, he felt something going around his head and then around the tree, securing his face there. 

�I am going to let you fuck the little 'love-hole' that I have scratched into the tree for you, Jurij. Slide your knees closer to the tree.� 

His knees slid closer, difficult it was, but he managed. She grabbed hold of his cock and slipped it into the hole she had carved through the tree. Another piece of rope went around his hips and the tree, ensuring he couldn&#8217;t pull his penis out anymore. She walked in front of him and kicked his knees even more forward making sure that the head of his cock would poke out through the other end of the hole. 

Then began to gently run with her fingernails over the helpless head of his cock until Jurij couldn&#8217;t hold back his desires any longer and started to moan.

�Does turtle want to come out to play?� Alessia cooed, tickling the pinkish-brown head. She took care that his member was sufficiently fondled and squeezed by her hands, before she stood up and spoke quietly: �Now you get your lesson in the history of the Red Army. But make sure that your penis doesn&#8217;t get soft in the meantime. If he does I might have to keep him extended by pulling a rope around the head of your valuable penis and tying it to that tree. But you won't want that to happen, do you?�

His mouth firmly pressed against the trunk Jurij couldn't answer a single word, so he tried to shake his head instead. Alessia showed herself generous and accepted this kind of answer.

�Okay then: As even an unfilled head like yours might already know, our brave Bolshevik government declared that traditional Cossack lands were now to be run by all Russian people. This glorious gesture provoked revolts of the Cossacks. Although the Cossacks were betraying the ideals of the free people of Russia, the Cossacks managed to gather troops of lousy betrayers -&nbsp; the so-called 'Volunteer Army'. 

Unfortunately the signing of the peace-treaty with Germany in Brest-Litovsk resulted in direct intervention of the still imperialistic ruled states of England and France in Russia. England and France also started to arm the 'Volunteer Army'. In January of this year the bloody conflicts between the 'Volunteer Army' and our Bolshevik forces lead into a Civil War. Our Council of People's Commissars decided to replace our provisional Red Guard with a permanent Communist army &#8211; that was the birth of our glorious 'RED ARMY'! Everything understood?�
Jurij only moaned behind the tree. But the abounding flood of information of Alessia's lecture seemed to have soften Jurij's hard on. The head of his cock was already beginning to recede in the hole. As promised Alessia's slender hands grabbed a piece of rope. Not taking her own eyes off his she slowly tied a rope around the head of Jurij's penis and pulled the rope slightly around the tree.
Jurij's moaning became louder &#8211; like he was begging her to stop. But Alessia didn't want to show mercy. Instead she preferred to threaten her little mal'chik a little bit more, saying: �You better think about something to make him hard quickly or my next incentive would be a little cock-whipping with this sweet little rose twig here. I&#8217;m sure it plenty of thorns might leave some nasty sting on your sensitive skin.�
To Jurij's luck the touch of Alessia's finger and the firm tugging of the rope let his cock become hard again. As Alessia wanted to be a fair Commandress towards him, she stopped her little torturing and fixed the rope around the tree. Still she had to pinch the head of Jurij's penis between her fingernails when she spoke: �Seems as we got him hard again! Good for you! But remember, mal'chik, now if it goes soft again, it will hurt you.� 
Licking her lips, she noticed that his young legs were visibly quivering. How she loved seeing all the anxious fears now growing within him and reflected in his large terrified eyes.

�But you can still beg me to tickle the head a little if you want.� she cruelly laughed at him.
�Now let's continue our little history-lesson about of the glorious Red Army! Where have I stopped? Ah yes: The central figure behind the founding of the Red Army was comrade Leon Trotsky - the People's Commissar for War.
When it became apparent that a revolutionary army composed solely of workers would be far too small, Trotsky instituted mandatory conscription of the rural peasantry into the Red Army. Clever, isn't he? Of course not everyone wanted to risk his life in the fighting for the Red Army. So Trotsky created special detachments of the secret police "Cheka" and attached one to each Red Army in the field. These so-called Special Punitive Department of the All-Russian Extraordinary Commission for Combat of Counter-Revolution and Sabotage take an active part in the suppression of anti-communist peasant riots, punishment of deserters and the liquidation of persons believed disloyal to the Bolshevik government during the Civil War. Nastasija wants to join one of these&nbsp; Special Punitive Brigades &#8211; so you better take care never to annoy her!� Alessia smirked at the last sentence. Of course she would always protect her little mal'chik from Nastasija's sadism. But he didn't have to know that yet!

Enjoying the pitiful sight of the tied up Jurij, she stated: �I bet your penis hurts right now, it&#8217;s too bad you made me do that. Looking at me while fucking my love hole, should make it easy to you to stay hard all the time. The next time I tell you stay hard, I hope you listen to me. You will be here until dinner time. I will come back and ask you some questions about what I just taught you before I decide if you should be untied. You better understand quickly that any lecture that has to be repeated leads into a learning style which will feel much worse than the one before. So my hope is that I do not have to repeat too many of my lectures.�

She walked away without a glance back. Her pussy was soaking wet and seeing him there so vulnerable, fucking the tree because she made him, gave her an overwhelming feeling of power and lust. 
She went inside to prepare things for lesson two of her re-education process. She may have to come up with other methods for the program, but she was going to have as much sadistic fun as she could with this one.

An hour later she decided that it was time to look over at her pupil again. He was lightly rocking his knees, pushing his cock deeper in the hole to let up some of the pressure on his head, and then when the tree dug in too much to his balls, he would relax his hips. She was enjoying the sight of his silent suffering�this was what she had hoped would happen.

 She let this go on for quite a while, in fact it was almost dark when she walked over to him and untied his head.

�Your hips better keep moving while I ask you these questions Jurij.�

She spent ten minutes questioning him in what she had taught him, being careful to watch to make sure he was still fucking the tree. Fortunately for him, Jurij didn't make any mistakes this time.

�Very good, Jurij. I am pleased by your progress!�

�Are you enjoying my love hole?� she whispered into his ear, licking his earlobe ever so gently. 

�Yes Commandress.�

His cock jumped inside the hole.

�You like that Jurij?� She asked, licking one more time.

His cock jumped again, as he moaned �Yes.�

�I will be back for you shortly, I have a hunch you will need to urinate soon.�

He groaned and realized his own urge to pee. �But I have to pee as well.�

Looking back over her shoulder seductively, she spoke: �Good, but you are not permitted to! Still it is good to know that you have to�.

�...but Commandress, I really have to go.�

�Then you shouldn&#8217;t have any problem when I am ready to allow you to. I will be back soon.�

When Alessia walked back over to Jurij the sun had completely set and the fire had become just coals. She stepped around the tree; watching her bound mal&#8217;chik wary eyes. He looked so sore and tired.
In fact there was just one desire left inside Jurij: he desperately wanted to pee. Peeing was all he thought of over the last minutes. Fortunately the rope around his penis helped him to fight the urging pressure in his bladder. But now Alessia&#8217;s hand grabbed the head of his cock and started to untied it. Jurij had to concentrate much harder to let no accident happen.

�Jurij, are you ready to remain respectful when you talk to me?�

�Yes Commandress.�

�Good!� 

Now Alessia nestled herself against him and let her hand wander over his naked spine. Despite having been drained of its power his body still felt magnificently hard and full. His skin was smooth and slightly slick with the wetness of the woods.

�If you ever yell at me again, like you did when we discovered your house was burnt, I am apt to make you fuck my love hole again. Only the next time I will smear some sugar all over your prick before you go in the hole, and you can bet it will last more than a couple of hours. Are you going to yell at me again?�

�No Commandress, I will not yell at you again.�

�I have cooked supper for us. I will untie you now and then you will follow me inside to eat.�

�May I please urinate before, Commandress?�

�No, Jurij, you may not! You will hold it.�

�But...�

�There is no &#8216;but&#8217;! I don&#8217;t want to hear anymore &#8216;but&#8217; from you, Jurij.�

Somehow, he was not sure how, but somehow he was still able to hold it back.

After he was fully untied from the tree, Alessia demanded him to kiss her boots clean for her.

His head went straight for the ground and he immediately began to perform his task. When her boots were spotless, Jurij heard her voice ordering from above: �Crawl into the shack and I will give you your supper.� 

But along the way he was unable to hold his piss. He ended up pissing all over himself. 

As Alessia saw what happened, she went furious: �You dirty pig��&nbsp; 

Jurij lowered his head and groveled at her feet that he was sorry, he had tried to hold it as long as he could.

�You might as well roll in the mud now, Jurij! In fact I will make sure that my little pig gets plenty of mud to roll in. Lie down on your back!�

Then she began to pee all over his body. He writhed under her stream of piss, but it just kept hitting his face. The salty urine burnt inside his eyes.&nbsp; Some even got in his mouth.

�Roll in the mud you little pig. Oh and don&#8217;t&#8217; think you won&#8217;t be punished for disobeying my order.�&nbsp; 

"Commandress, please, I beg you!" he implored. 
But Alessia didn&#8217;t listen. She even placed the sole of her right boot on his face and pressed it deeply into a puddle of piss to intensify his misery. As she got tired of watching him squirming below her, she took away her boot and drove its top up between his legs, perhaps just a little more roughly than necessary. Jurij shouted out in pain.
Alessia just stated coldly �We are heading down to the south in the morning and I was in hopes to enjoy a nice evening using your tongue, but you have spoiled that. Don&#8217;t move mal'chik, I will be right back.�

She walked into the shack and a moment or two later, she came back. 

�Let&#8217;s go, Jurij! Back to the love hole.�

�Commandress, please.�

�Please what?�

�Please not that.�

�Too late, mal'chik! Move now!�

Producing a yelp, she grabbed a handful of his hair and dragged him to the tree. True to her word she smeared some sticky wet sugar all over his balls and cock. Jurij wondered where the sugar would come from. It must have been sugar for her horse that she had taken out of her saddle-bag.

His scared genitals seemed to retract themselves into his body, but that didn&#8217;t disturb her. All she had to do to make his soft cock go through the hole, was tying a little rope around it, run the rope through the hole and yank it firmly on the other side of the trunk. She smirked appreciatively as she listened to his slight gasping that had become so familiar to her.

Then she stood up, placed her boot against his ass and pushed his body forward against the tree. Now he was in the perfect position to get re-tied. It looked like he would actually be fucking the tree
Satisfied with her work, Alessia walked to the shack and left him.

[ NEW COMPANIONS ]
After Alessia had woken up at the next morning, walked straight out to the tree Jurij was tied to. 
Little ants had found the sugar around his genitals and built a little ant street. Alessia smiled at the wicked thought how thousands of little ant feet must have teased Jurij&#8217;s sensitive cock during the last hours. His body was shaking from the coldness of the night. You could see where other bugs had landed on his cock and balls and had bit him.&nbsp; 
Alessia knew that Jurij must be starving by now &#8211; the last time that she had allowed him to eat had been yesterday at noon. 

So Alessia untied him and spoke out in a gently caring voice: �Good morning, Jurij. Time to eat some breakfast. In fact I have brought you your supper from yesterday. It had become cold by now, but that is hardly my fault, is it?�

 He crawled over to where she sat, with an obvious frown on his face�

�You better get that look off your face, or I might decide that I don&#8217;t want to give you breakfast at all.�

He tried to change the look on his face and suddenly she grabbed a handful of hair forced his head up to look at her.

�It is only your stubborn behavior that had brought yourself into this situation. Now eat.�

... and Jurij ate.

When he was finished, Alessia asked: �Are you thirsty Jurij?�

�Yes.�

�Good! Then you should be able to clean this up for me. Open your mouth.�

She straddled his face and pissed down his throat speaking matter-of-factly: �You better swallow all of it. It&#8217;s all you get to drink for the next hours.� 

Over the night Jurij had accepted the inevitableness of taking her piss whenever his Commandress desired. He was unsure how, but somehow after making him roll in it, he was sure he would inevitably be required to drink it as well. He obediently opened his mouth and swallowed.
In fact Jurij couldn't help but still admire the fine trim figure of her silhouette that was standing above him. Alessia&#8217;s features were so elegant and regal that he just had to desire her no-matter how much humiliation he had to take. 

�I see you&#8217;ve learned that it&#8217;s better not to resist my wishes! I welcome that! I&#8217;m thinking about showing my gratefulness by giving you a new job. Not only are you responsible for keeping my boots clean, you shall also be my toilet from now on whenever I need to pee.�


�As you wish, Commandress.�

�You may go down to the stream and wash up! Should you need to pee, you may.�

�Thank you Commandress, but I also have to�um�well I have to have a bowel movement.�

She smiled and with her gloved hand, she produced some leaves for him to wipe with. He washed the muddy urine off himself in the stream and did his bathroom duty. When he came back to the cabin, she was dressed in his clothing. 

�Mal'chik, you will wear my Red-Army-uniform for the walk.�&nbsp; 

�But...? Why?�

�Actually it is quite simple: Should we met up with any of Denikin's troops, they would kill you first.�

Jurij was shocked by her answer. He would have never considered such cold logic from a woman like Alessia. But finally he had to realize that she got her point. Without him Alessia&#8217;s life might lack an enjoyable playmate. But without her his life would miss his purpose. Compared to her life his existence had become disposable. Letting the impact of these thoughts sink into his mind, Jurij laid in a daze for about ten minutes, just starring into the endless sky. Alessia let him generously have his time, while smoking a cigarette on her own. 
When she finally put it out, she smiled at Jurij and said: �I think your ass has healed enough so that we can start traveling again in the morning. We will leave at sun up.�

Jurij looked very confused, however he took her trousers and tried to put them on. One moment later, he hesitantly looked at her and mumbled: "They don't fit me.�

She looked at him and laughed. "Come on, mal&#8217;chik! You just have to take a deep breath in and then push them up your sweet hips!"

�Please don't do made me embarrass myself like that, Alessia!"

"Oh don't be a chicken! Beside: no one will know you where we will go anyway!"

He turned from Alessia&#8217;s gaze and looked at the path that laid before of them. He got to admit the more Alessia rationalized it all the more appealing it got.

They were very tight, especially in the groin area, but finally he got the trousers all the way up. Jurij&#8217;s balls were split down the middle and he feared that once he stood up they'd plop out on both sides. He pulled his dick up and placed it against his stomach before he tried buttoning the trousers. They were already getting swallowed in between his butt cheeks.

"There is no way I'm getting these buttoned."

"Come on, mal'chik! I know you can do it. Just suck that gut of yours in!" 

When he finally got them buttoned, Alessia handed him her uniform shirt. He put it on as well and once more there seemed to be no way to get it buttoned. Quickly Alessia got in front of her mal'chik and firmly tied her leather belt around the still open shirt.

�That will do!� she cheered. "Now turn around for me and let me see my cute little mal&#8217;chik in all his glory." 

And Jurij turned around for her. She let out another laugh, which made him smile. Beside the uniform smelled so pleasantly of her that wearing it seemed to be a great opportunity for Jurij to get permanently reminded of his Commandress. Still Jurij felt like if he took one deep breathe and everything he was wearing would just fly off of him. He was unsure how long he could wear them, however he resolved himself to not complain. Still Alessia noticed these silent doubts in her mal&#8217;chik. She deeply looked into his eyes and said �Do I need to cut down the tree, and bring pieces of wood with us?�

�No Commandress, I will not give you reason to require it.�

Alessia got a cruel smile on her face and said: �Somehow I doubt that, but I will take you at your word. Let&#8217;s go, so that we don&#8217;t have to be walking after dark this evening.� 

They began to walk together, her horse carrying nothing, until they reached his property.
They walked up to the hanged people and Alessia said, matter of factly: �You will get me those two ropes.�&nbsp; 

Jurij lowered his head in shame, and walked over to the tree the two were tied to and let down the ropes. They crashed to the ground with a thud. Jurij reluctantly removed the ropes and walked them to Alessia. 
Then another smile came to Alessia&#8217;s face, this time he was scared, he had never seen that smile before.&nbsp; �You might as well get the sign too Jurij, that is the truth now too.�&nbsp; 

Jurij&#8217;s brain wasn&#8217;t quick enough to stop his mouth from saying �you have got to be kidding me�, she lashed out with her foot and caught him square in the balls, a kick that for him came out of nowhere, however seemed to hold every bit of strength she had.&nbsp; It caused him to drop to his knees, gasping for air. Once&nbsp; he could form words and didn&#8217;t feel like his balls were in his throat, immediately he apologized to Alessia.
�Commandress, I don&#8217;t know what I was thinking I am so sorry, I will shut up now and do what was asked, I am sorry.� 

�Not as sorry as you&#8217;re going to be if you don&#8217;t hurry up and get that sign.� 

�Yes Commandress.� 

He walked over and picked up the sign.&nbsp; Alessia made him put it around his neck so it hung off his back, she took out a piece of black coal and altered the sign slightly. 

�I have betrayed the glorious nation of Russia by co-operating with the Red Army!� 

Then she took one hangman&#8217;s noose and placed it around his neck and tightened it up. The second rope she cut into 4 shorter pieces with her knife.&nbsp; 

�Hands behind your back, Jurij.�

He placed them behind his back and she adjusted them so his forearms where touching under the sign and she tied them there.&nbsp; �Let&#8217;s go now Jurij, I will want to take a rest when the sun is at its highest.�&nbsp; She climbed atop the horse and pulled gently on the rope, �Step up here Jurij and you better keep up.�

It wasn&#8217;t more than twenty&nbsp; kilometers of walking quickly to keep up with her horse, that he had this urge to scratch the backside of his balls and around his ass.&nbsp; The further he walked the worse the urge got.&nbsp; He discovered a way in those tight trousers to wiggle his ass a little so the trousers raked across his skin and the more he rubbed, the worse it itched.&nbsp; 

Alessia kept looking back noticing the way he was walking, but was impressed that Jurij had not said anything yet.&nbsp; In fact, for over an hour he walked beside her horse and not one time did he complain.&nbsp; When Alessia whoa-ed her horse; Jurij was not sure if he should say anything to her, or not.&nbsp; His itching had now changed to a burning sensation.&nbsp; Alessia climbed off of her horse and said �Jurij, I feel a little bad making you walk while I ride. You may get on and ride a ways and when it&#8217;s time to stop, we can switch.&nbsp; She helped him climb up into the saddle, secured his feet to the stirrups, and then tied his noose to the horse&#8217;s neck.&nbsp; Alessia took the reins and effectively gagged him with them, wrapping them several times around his head.&nbsp; She walked ahead of her horse for 2 solid hours.&nbsp; When she stopped, Jurij&#8217;s ass hurt so much he was in silent tears; fearful of irritating her, not wanting to tell her anything was wrong.&nbsp; She stopped under a big old oak tree with plenty of branches.&nbsp; When she came around to untie his neck and mouth, she reached to help him down.&nbsp; She noticed the tears, and asked, �Jurij whatever is the matter?�&nbsp; 

He shook his head and wouldn&#8217;t answer her.&nbsp; She gently touched his cheek and said quietly, �Jurij please tell me what is wrong.�&nbsp; 

Crying, he blurted out, �My groin and my rectum feel like they are on fire right now.&nbsp; May I please get up and take off these trousers, please? I beg you, Commandress.�

�You may Jurij, let&#8217;s see what is the matter.� 

She helped him down, and assisted him with removing his trousers, not untying him just removing the trousers. 

�Bend over Jurij, let me see.�

She slapped his ass when he didn&#8217;t move fast enough.&nbsp; When she saw his ass and the back of his balls, she began to giggle, �Jurij, I am so sorry, it seems I gave you the wrong leaves to wipe with, you have a poison ivy rash that is almost raw, lucky for you Jurij, you aren&#8217;t bleeding yet, but I suppose I will have to let you be naked right now, so that air can get to that and help dry it out. I am awful glad I didn&#8217;t need to have a bowel movement this morning. I must have remembered the wrong list�good thing I didn&#8217;t pick any mushrooms for us to eat.� Giggling more, and definitely not sounding sorry at all.

�But I do have to pee, so down on your knees mal&#8217;chik and take care of this full bladder for me.�&nbsp; He begrudgingly complied; she could see the look of disgust on his face.&nbsp; 

She took a few items out of her bag and sat down under the tree.

�Come over here Jurij, I want you to lie on your stomach right here in front of me, please.�&nbsp; 

Jurij, looked angry, but he did as he was told.&nbsp; She looked into his eyes and said, �We will need to stay here, until your ass heals, I can&#8217;t parade you around naked, and you can&#8217;t wear trousers right now, so you are going to take this canvas and make me a make shift tent for the night, and if you&#8217;re a good mal'chik, I will allow you to lick my pussy when you are finished.&nbsp; So you better start by getting that look off of your face.�
Jurij did what was asked of him and that night by the fire, she did indeed allow him to give her pussy pleasure.
For the next two days, Jurij and Alessia stayed by that oak tree.&nbsp; He spent many hours showing her pussy his gratitude for not having to move much.

During the night, the horse got spooked and ran away, there was high wind and a couple of loud crashes in the woods. When Alessia awoke she noticed the mare was gone. Now they would both be walking.&nbsp; She woke Jurij up and said �Come on, sleepyhead let&#8217;s get going we have a long ways to go today.�

Jurij slowly stirred and knew he must get right up or take the chance of angering her.
He began his morning ritual of going away from where they were, urinating and having a bowel movement. He washed up in the creek and arrived back at Alessia&#8217;s side.&nbsp; 

As he approached, he noticed that she had been squatting down half naked.&nbsp; �Commandress, I am thirsty, may I have something to drink.�

�No Jurij, you took too long at the creek, I have just wasted your morning fluid�now you will have to wait a few hours.&nbsp; Get our things packed up so we can go.�&nbsp; She didn&#8217;t seem angry but she didn&#8217;t seem happy either.&nbsp; 

Jurij obediently packed up their few belongings and they began to walk. He had to admit, his ass and balls did not feel as though they were on fire today. They walked for a few hours. The next break they took, Alessia had to pee again and Jurij eagerly drank his morning beverage. 

Despite the salty taste, it didn&#8217;t seem to be as bad as that first time. Perhaps it was the fact that he knew she loved when he drank it? He almost seemed to enjoy his beverage that his Commandress was providing for him. 

Alessia grew curious: �Tell me mal&#8217;chik : How do you like my salty nectar?�

�I must admit that although I'm disgusted by it, I also feel somehow bewitched by it. After all this liquid something has been inside your adorable body before and now it somehow &#8216;occupies&#8217; my own body. Like poison would do!�

�Better think of it as medicine, that Dr Alessia has prescribed, my dear! It might taste awful but not taking it will harm you much worse. 
I am trying to educate you. And I must work from the inside out as well as the outside in. The knowledge that my liquid is always inside you will make you feel more dependent to me. Oh &#8211; how I love that thought.�

�I can see that! In fact I am a little worried by the joy you seem to have when you have forced me to wear your uniform as well as to accept your pee. I'm starting to fear that you take me on a way where I will slowly loose my whole personality to you. What will be left of me in the end? Will it be still enough to be loved by you?�

�Where have you learned to get so poetic, my dear?� Alessia mocked in amused irony. �Still my honest answer would be: We will have to see how much will be left of your personality at the end! For the moment it is still enough to keep my entertained! But as your fate will remain in my hands, you better take care not to piss me off anymore!�

�You scare me!�

�And scared of me is what you should be, Jurij. Parts of me still want to be nice to you, but there other parts inside me that want to overpower you. Overpower you throughout your entire being. And these parts are actually getting stronger and stronger. And this parts of me will surely not tolerate any disobedience from you nor any disrespect.�










[ THE WOMAN WITH THE RED JACKET ]
Mikael shivered inside his coat as he trudged up the winding path to Pavel's house. Let the rest of the Alexandrovich-family hide cowardly in their dacha, Mikael preferred to stay in a real house. Of course Mikael would have even more preferred when this 'real house' would be one of his own ones, but here in the outskirts of the Caucasus, he couldn't be too picky. After all, Pavel was a great friend, who would let Mikael live in his home like a member of his own family.

So while Mikael's cousin Jurij was bravely protecting the family's estate against the chaos of revolution and while the rest of the Alexandrovich-clan was squeezing himself in their narrow dacha-asylum, Mikael was looking forward to relax himself by the fireplace with a hot drink in his hands.
Others might fight and die for their stupid revolution, Mikael would sell them their weapons and enjoy his life a little in the meantime.

But then his eyes discovered a tall stranger framed in the doorway pf Pavel's house. And this stranger looked female. She was obviously waiting for someone. But here? For whom? For Pavel? Quite unlikely!

Slowly Mikael came closer and gained a better look at her.
The woman was wearing a woolen red jacket, that was decorated with velvet bindings and a oversized pointed collar. The double closure of large tulip engraved brass buttons gave her jacket a sophisticated style. 
The outfit was completed by tight breeches that flattered her shapely legs before they ended in a pair of black boots.
In dangerous times like this, the occasions had become quite rarely, to see a woman wearing such stylish clothes.
What could such a magnificent young woman want from someone as average as like Pavel?
Mikael couldn't take his eyes from her beauty anymore. Everything within the range of his senses, from the shining sun-light to the haunted emptiness of the surrounding decrepit landscape, seemed to be nothing but an extension of this mystic lady.

Finally Mikael had reached the stairs to step up the porch. Now he was standing at the same ground with her. Still she could look down at Mikael. Mikael was amazed how impressively tall this woman was.

"Good morning!" he curiously greeted the unknown guest.

"Good morning!" was all that came out of her pouty lips in return.

Mikael looked at her, watching how the straight streaks of her shiny black hair easily breezed in the wind.
Her face was definitely cute, even strikingly cute. But - somehow - there was something more inside. Something perky that Mikael just couldn't find the right words yet to describe.
Although her short response had made him feel at little bit fooled, he urged to get more information about this woman.

"Can I help you?" he finally dared to asked.

For the first time the hazel eyes of hers turned to look at him. In fact Mikael felt being estimated by them. He got a little bit uncomfortable.
&nbsp; 
"Hmm..., maybe you actually might!" she answered in a quite and somehow very disparaging tone.
"I am looking for a man called Mikael Alexandrovich. Do you know him?"

"Yes, I do!"

"Really? Have you seen him recently?" Now Mikael had the full attention of the mysterious woman. He somehow felt proud about it!

"Yes!"

"Where?"

"I saw him this morning in the mirror, when I washed myself!"

Mikael's answer was supposed to be funny. The perfect introduction into some flirt-talk.
But unfortunately the young woman wasn't interested in a flirt.

Instead her eyes pierced seemed to pierce right through him when she said: "Alright, Mr. Alexandrovich, I need to talk to you. Would you let me in, please?"

"Talk with me? About what?"

"Business matters! Can we get inside NOW?" In her voice rang an insistence that he didn't expected from a young woman like her.

Intimidated by this pertinacity Mikael unlocked to front-door and let her in. Then he followed the click of her boot heels through the entrance lobby and into the large lounge.

Mikael hung his coat by the door and gestured his guest to a straight-backed chair. 

"Have a seat. I'll just light the fire and fix you something to drink!"

To Mikael's surprise, the woman did not even look at him when a cold and clear "Thank you!" came over her lips. From the corner of his eyes Mikael watched her unbuttoning her red jacket. Underneath appeared a sleeveless white shirt. The light of the starting fire softly gleamed in its silk.
Mikael had to remember himself not to stare too obviously to this sight of pure feminine beauty.

A few minutes later Mikael reappeared in front of her bearing a mug of steaming coffee laced with some drops of precious vodka. 

The unknown beauty sat down and took a healthy swig, quickly followed up by a second large gulp. 

"Aah, that really hits the spot. Thanks!"

As Mikael had planned, her cold aura of authority got slowly softened by the cozy atmosphere of the room and his warmed-up alcohol. For a short moment it even seemed to him that a smile rushed over her cute face.
Mikael became confident again.

"You're welcome. So, what's your name?"

Actually Mikael was more wondering about her age, which he still wasn't capable to guess. But no honorable man would dare to ask a young woman for her age, wouldn't he?

"I am Comrade Nastasija."

"Comrade? ...so you actually are a Bolshevik?"

"Sure! You have a problem with that?" she challenged him.

"God no! In fine with it! It's just...." Mikael wanted to say that he never saw a Bolshevik who was dressed that stylish and bourgeois. But then he told himself to watch his tongue before he would accidentally insult her political ideals.

"It's just WHAT?"

"Ah, nothing. So what kind of business brings you here?"

"The business of war." she said in a carefree voice that just didn't seem to fit to the seriousness of her answer.

"Oh, come on! Isn't the 'business of war' a too sad subject for a beautiful young lady like you?"

"No - I guess the 'business of war' contains just the perfect amount of sadness to keep me motivated."

Mikael didn't dare to ask her for what kind of motivation she would need the 'sadness of war'. Instead he wanted to change this awkward subject back into some easy-going small-talk.

"So is there already a smart, nice guy like me waiting for you to kiss your sweet lips when the sadness of this war is finally over? Otherwise I might still offer you my service."

"Are you still trying to flirt with me, Mikael?"

"Would you like me to flirt with you?" Mikael promptly asked back, somehow proud of his ready-witted response.

What he hadn't expected was the ready-wittedness of her answer: "Well, I guess I do! It makes more fun to wipe out the existence of a counter-revolutionist when I know that this bastard has a secret crush on me. It makes my acting appear so delightfully ruthless."

Mikael found himself speechless and confused. This answer was meant as a joke, wasn't it? Still Nastasija's averted eyes didn't give away any sign how serious she was. Mikael tried to stay cool, but deep inside he grew more and more uncomfortable.

Then out of a sudden she looked directly into his face and started to grin. Quickly the grin became a hilarious laugh, letting her sharp white teeth shine brightly in the surrounding gloom.
Although he knew that she was laughing at him, Mikael forced himself to laugh back at her - it just seemed to be the best thing he could do to get out of this awkward situation without loosing his face.

Once more he had this slight feeling of getting outsmarted by her craftiness.

"Is everything alright with you? I hope I haven't scared you off or something?"

"No! Of course not. I'm okay!" Mikael eagerly guaranteed. Still Mikael could barely meet her eyes after that joke. Beneath her smugness and overwhelming sexual superiority he was profoundly diminished.

"Okay then!" Nastasija took over the lead of conversation "Why don't you me about the things you do to earn the money for living!?"

"I do nothing certain. Mostly I just buy stuff that somebody else might need. And then I sell this stuff to him for a little service fee."

"What kind of stuff?"

"Oh - all kind of stuff that people require for their daily life. Like scythes and sickles for the up-coming harvest. Or a grinding stone for the local mill."

For a while Nastasija and Mikael continued this kind of easy-going conversation. Mikael calmed himself that Nastasija interest for his business seemed to be absolutely harmless. Maybe he could even convince her to buy some stuff from him?
But then Nastasija's acting seems to change somehow. Like she grew more and more anxious for something coming up.

"Why are you always looking at your watch?" Mikael asked. Trying to keep their small-talk in an easy-going mood he added half-ironically: "You don't have appointment with another date, have you? Otherwise you might want to forget about him. No second date can offer you more attraction than such a charming man like me!"

But Nastasija completely ignored his poor joke. Her hazel eyes just kept looking deep into the flames of the roaring fire.
Just as Mikael began to think about a nice remark that would re-start their conversation, Nastasija stretched out her booted legs and said: "I just realized that I've stayed here for one hour already. If I don't report back to my unit after one hour, the arresting forces have order to come and do their work. So they should be here be now."

Mikael’s eyes narrowed. Then they became wide with disbelief. 

"This is a joke, right?"

"Why would I joke about it?" Nastasija wondered in her most sweetly innocent tone.

Mikael's face went pale. Then he heard some noised coming from the outside.

"Oh - I suppose they are finally coming!" Nastasija cheered. Noticing the rising terror in Mikael's eyes, she calmly smiled: "Don't worry too much, Mikael Alexandrovich. They will just take you to the next Soviet. That's where your case will be investigated. After you have survived a few days of interrogation the rest will go pleasantly fast for you! They will bring the remaining of your body into one of the nearby woods, where you will be executed."

Mikael kept starring at her mouth. The tone that came out of these lips had stayed cool and without any compassion, as if he was no more than cattle to be slaughtered.

"Pleeeease!" Mikael finally started to whine. "You have to save me!"

"Sorry, Mikael! It's like I have already told you before: I really enjoy wiping out the existence of a lousy counter-revolutionist. But there is no need to cry! As I kind of like you, I promise to always stay around you and to take care that you won't have to suffer more than necessary!"

When her lovely smile slowly turned into a devilish smirk, Mikael suddenly realized that this woman was enjoying his misery just too much to help him out. Any more pleading would only waste his time - and time had become valuable now! At the next moment he turned and ran into the kitchen.

Mikael couldn't believe his luck when he actually managed to get out through the back-entrance of the kitchen without being hunt down by his persecutors. Should he really have a chance of escape this precarious situation, just because he had smartly used his advantage of surprise?
Mikael kept running. Running through the little wood and then further along the winding path back to the village. Didn't dare to look back. But while he had been concentrating on what lay directly ahead of him, his mind still got haunted by visions of Nastasija's smirking face. Those dark eyes really frightened him as much as they fascinated him.

Suddenly he heard the sounds of horses coming up. They set off after him.
Mikael kept sprinting as fast as he could, but the clip-clop of hooves still became louder and louder.
Finally he turned around.
Nastasija and three other riders were approaching him at speed. Although his startled eyes had hardly enough time to take in Nastasija's glorious sight, they still noticed the nasty looking crop which was already swinging in her hand.

Then everything happened very fast. With the uninhibited force of Nastasija's high speed the crop slashed against Mikael's head and shoulders. His whole body seemed to explode as the burning line of fire cut into his tender flesh. He winced in pain, but in the end he managed to keep his balance.

In the meantime Nastasija had already stopped her horse and turned it around. Once more the clip-clop of hooves signaled her up-coming approach. If Mikael wouldn't find himself a good protection within the next seconds, Nastasija's crop would surely knock him down this time. Then she would have won this game.

Biting his lip hard he staggered a little, before he run zig-zag across the field, seeking escape in the nearby wood. And indeed he managed to dodge Nastasija's nasty crop this time. Still the brute force of her attack made him fall down to the ground.
Panicking slightly, Mikael tried to rise, managed to stagger to his feet and take two clumsy steps towards the wood before his mounted huntress approached him for another attack. 
While Mikael was lucky enough not to be kicked by the horse's hooves, Nastasija's heavy boot slammed right against his head.
His knees buckled and he pitched forward onto his face as the world roared around him. Over the sound of Nastasija's triumphant rejoice he felt blackness descend.
[ THE ENDLESS MARCH TO SARATOVSKAYA ]
After their break Alessia and Jurij continued their long walk to Saratovskaya. They walked for two more hours before they ran into a group of several other refugees – all of them trying to flee southwards towards Saratovskaya before the White Army would catch them.
Alessia decided that she and Jurij would travel more secure if they join this track. In the chaos of the civil war nobody of the refugees was taking care about the joining of another young woman and his boyfriend. In fact most of the people looked so tired as if they wouldn't take care for anything anymore. It didn’t take long until Jurij recognized a familiar face between the refugees in the group and after a while of hard thinking he even managed to remember her name: Nadja Lukova! He knew her because she used to date his cousin Mikael. Inside him grew the urge to talk to her and find out what she knew, but he wasn't sure how Alessia would handle such an approach.

At high noon -&nbsp; while the sun was at its highest - the group decided to stop, take a break and cook lunch. Alessia actually used the opportunity to lay down for a short nap. As soon as Alessia seemed to be sleeping, Jurij went over to Nadja.

"Hello! You are Nadja, right?"

The woman smiled at Jurij as she obviously recognized him as well. “Right! And you are... Joshua right?”

“Nearly! I’m Jurij.”

“Okay – yeah: Jurij! I remember! Mikael’s cousin!” she explained. Looking at his weird outfit she asked: "Are you okay?"

Jurij let out a laugh and said: "Oh yes.... I am okay. It is just that... Well, let’s say: I had a tough time recently!”

“I see. It has been quite a troubled time since I saw you last time. So who is that woman you are traveling with?”

As Jurij didn't want to scare Nadja off, he just said: “That’s an old friend of mine, named Alessia. Our relationship has made a lot of changes in the last time, but that’s a very long story. In the end I guess I have become some kind of consultant for her.”

“That's sounds interesting! Maybe you have the time to tell me this long story sometimes?”

“Maybe! Have you heard anything about Mikael recently?”

“Me? Not much! After we have broken up, I have heard only very little about him. But maybe you know more – after all&nbsp; he is supposed to be your cousin?!”
Over the next minutes Jurij told Nadja everything he knew about Mikael, while she seemed happy to tell him all of the things that had happened to her over the last few months. Jurij listened carefully, moving slightly closer, until he could even see the fine dark hairs of her eye lashes and smell her subtle odor of femininity.
In the end more than hour had passed before Jurij realized the rest of the group was getting ready to leave. He excused himself to go awaken Alessia. 
On his little way he was thinking what kind of relief it was to chat with another girl beside Alessia. In fact it had been his first chat with a sweet, young girl since his war imprisonment. No – since his time as a soldier in war even! His last flirt seemed to be an eternity away. Well - chatting with Nadja maybe hadn't been a real flirt, but it definitely had been a very easy-going chatting with a very lovely girl. And the fact that it wasn't authorized – and not even known – by Alessia gave Jurij back his feeling of freedom and independence. His wild, boyish days surely weren't over yet!
Much to his surprise Alessia had already sat up and was watching him when he arrived back to her. She had a very annoyed look on her face, however she said nothing. When the rest of the group started walking, Alessia grabbed Jurij's arm to hold him back. 
When he looked at her with quizzing eyes, she just stated coldly at him: “Stay here with me. We will catch up with the group later!”

As soon as the group had left their sight, Alessia's face turned stone cold:&nbsp; “Why were you talking to that nerjacha [= slut].”&nbsp; 

“She has been the ex-girlfriend of my cousin. I just hoped that she might be able to tell me something about his remaining.” a visibly nervous Jurij tried to explain.

“So I hope you made her clear, that you already belong to me!”

“Ah... well... maybe not exactly.”

“NO EXACTLY?”

“Well, I told her that I am some kind of consultant working for you!”

“Before this afternoon is over, you will have told this nerjacha the truth about you unconditional dependency to me!” Alessia demanded with fire burning in her eyes.

“But... I... I couldn’t tell her the truth about us, as I had to win her trust.”

“For what?”

“To find out more about Mikael. After all Nadja told me that Mikael was involved in some dubious deals when they broke up in 1917. She said that Mikael had actually delivered goods to the Democratic and Socialist revolutionists, as well as to the Czaristic troops. Nadja thinks that he might actually be a wartime-profiteer - but she never saw him dealing with weapons.”

“Shut up, mal’chik! I don’t give a shit about Mikael or any other lousy member of your family. But I’m quite concerned about your attitude towards our relationship. Remember though that I could have easily just let Nastasija take you to the court yard and have you executed. But you are still alive, because I have saved your from death penalty. Now you owe me your life. You are mine to do with what I want. And you should happily carry out my wishes, as well as show your gratitude to me for taking the time and effort to teach you.
But instead it seems though that you still are unwilling to admit my superiority over you. Maybe you need more of my medicine. I will be sure to adjust your doses to reflect your attitude, Jurij.”

“Come on! Why are you so mad at me? I have just tried to be a nice guy and cheer up poor Nadja. So aren't you acting a little bit unfair towards me?”

“You poor baby! It almost sounds as if you are pouting. You should remember however that in love and war everything is fair! Still it won't do you any good to complain. It is evident, that I will have to use a firmer hand with you. As it appears to me now, I am not sure that I can trust you to do as you are told, if I should be absent. The next time we see Nadja, you WILL tell her the truth about your relation to me, or I will make sure your tongue hurts you so much it will be difficult to even take your medicine. Have I made myself clear enough?”

“Yes! You have indeed!”

“Good! Then let’s go. We will need to hurry to catch up with the track of refugees.”

Thanks to Alessia's strict rushing, they only walked for about ten minutes until they indeed caught up to the group of refugees. When everyone stopped for the evening, Alessia made sure their fire pit was far enough away from the rest of the group, so that the others would not hear any whimpering noises from Jurij.

“I will build a separate fire for us and set up a camp for the night. You, mal'chik, are going to tell the nerjacha the truth. Don’t be long or I will eat supper without you.”

Jurij nodded his head in silent affirmation. Quickly he found Nadja sitting in the middle of the group and asked her to&nbsp; walk off to the side so that he could tell her some delicate news. But then his confidence left him. Instead of giving her an open confession, he just managed to stutter and stammer, but never quite got the right words out. He also didn’t realize that Alessia had approached them from behind and stood only a few feet behind him.

When he couldn’t get the words out of his mouth, Alessia walked up behind him and said: “My dear Nadja, what Jurij is trying to tell you, is that he become my prisoner, after he got caught breaking into my office. I have saved this man from execution because he loves me so much that he'll do anything for me... including getting dressed like this. "

Nadja didn't really acknowledge Alessia. She just starred at Jurij.

Alessia kept talking as Nadja continued to stare at Jurij: “Now he is being re-educated. I am his Commandress and so he will do as I say when I say it or suffer punishment from me. ...or he can visit the firing squad. Speaking of which Jurij, my boots are dirty.”&nbsp; 

Hesitantly he dropped to his knees and began to clean her boots with his shirt. When Jurij had finished cleaning her boots, Alessia cleared her throat, which in Jurij’s mind suggested to him that he was required to kiss them as well, which he did. He was very red in the face when he performed the task, however his cock was hard as a rock. 
When he had finished she only commanded: “That’s enough Jurij!”

Nadja stood there in shock, so Alessia explained: "He loves polishing my boots and he'd polish yours as well if I asked him too." 

Her words got Jurij blushing even more.

Fortunately he heard Nadja answer: “No thanks! I think I can keep my boots clean for myself.”

“Fine! Then let’s go, Jurij. And don’t let me catch you talking with someone behind my back again.”

What neighter Alessia nor Jurij noticed was the fact that Nadja's nipples still had hardened underneath her shirt.

When Alessia and Jurij reached the fire area, she said: “Jurij, now let Me hear you say the words again. Who are you?”

“I am your prisoner and nothing but your prisoner.” 

“Well said, Jurij.&nbsp; What was so difficult about telling her that?”

Looking down, Jurij shook his head. “I don’t know.”

She walks up close to him, touches his cheek softly and whispers ‘You know I have to punish you for not telling her the truth.”

“Yes, Commandress.”

Her face never altered, he was unsure if she angry, but he assumed she must be.

“And what else have you learnt today, my mal’chik?”

“I understand now that as your prisoner it is not up to me anymore to decide who I might talk to. So please forgive me!”

“I don’t think that you have earned my forgiveness yet. But I will give you another chance to tell the truth: Does Nadja make you hard Jurij?”

That was a tricky question. But Jurij wisely answered: “Not as much as you do, my Commandress.’

Alessia smiled at her smart prisoner and said: “Now, let me make this question a little easier for you: Does she make you hard? And don’t back off this time – it is a simple yes or no answer!”

“Yes Commandress, she does.” He replied looking down at the ground.

That was the moment when Alessia thought she heard something in the bushes. Looking around, she spotted a swift movement behind the tree. Then she saw the silhouette woman, trying to hide. And this woman was wearing the silver bracelet that Alessia had just seen around Nadja’s wrist.

Alessia yelled: “If you expect to have any skin left on your back side, you better come out of the woods Nadja…right now!”

Nadja all but ran to her feet. “What are you doing here, nerjacha?” Alessia asked, while Jurij was humiliated beyond belief. His face was a brilliant shade of red while he sat wondering if Nadja had heard the entire conversation. 

“Well, I had heard some news to tell Jurij about Mikael, but then I lost my nerve.” Nadja answered with her eyes downcast.

Thinking for a short moment, Alessia said to Nadja with a cruel grin on her face: “I am about to make Jurij comfortable for the evening. You will wait right here for my return.”

“Mal’chik come over to this tree. And open wide.”&nbsp; She placed an old sock of her into his mouth and then secured his head to the tree, making sure the sock wouldn’t be dislodged. She tied his hands together behind the tree. Then she pulled down his trousers and left them around his ankles, but his penis was clearly visible.&nbsp; He was now deep red in embarrassment.

 “I expect maintaining an erection will not be difficult for you at this point.&nbsp; Nadja and I are going to have a fun filled evening…you will think about why that sock is in your mouth, you will be right here until morning…unless I have to pee.&nbsp; Good night mal'chik, sweet dreams.”

She walked over toward the fire and she and Nadja began to talk quietly, the entire time, while kneeling and Alessia's feet and never once looking up into her eyes. At the end of their very long conversation Alessia took Nadja’s chin in her hand and made her look up at her, said a few words and Nadja burst into tears, kissing Alessia’s feet, working her way up from the feet to the knees, and continuing up the thighs to Alessia’s pussy. When Nadja reached Alessia’s pussy, she made love to her pussy with her tongue, causing Alessia to moan repetitiously and audibly. Jurij continued to feel like his groin had been kicked, and even cried at one point while listening to Nadja lick and suck on Alessia’s pussy. The two women fell asleep giving each other pleasure. Jurij dozed off a couple of times, but was not really comfortable enough to sleep.&nbsp; 

When Alessia awoke, she came right over to Jurij and untied him, commanded him to his knees and gave him his morning drink. This time when he had licked her clean, he looked up at her and said “Thank you Commandress.”

“For what Jurij?” she asked him, smiling sweetly.

“For…um…well for allowing me the privilege of being your toilet.”

“Are you feeling threatened, Jurij?”

“Threatened? What do you mean?”

“I mean, do feel like you could be replaced very quickly? That perhaps Nadja might have given me more pleasure than you have?”

Eyes lowered, he spoke very quietly: “I... I deeply hope that there will always be something that only I can offer you.”

His bold answer made Alessia smile. She walked closer to him and grabbed his balls, squeezing them in her hand The strength of her grip was not enough to actually hurt him, but surely enough to let him know she had a firm hold on them.

“You're right. Nadja hasn't something to offer me like these, has she?” she whispered into his ear.

He shook his head no and Alessia let the fingernails of her other hand dig into the top side of his penis, which had grown fully fully erect again.

“And she surely hasn't one of these neighter !?” she whispered at him and again he shook his head no.

“Look at me, Jurij.”&nbsp; 

Without any inhibitions her hands played with Jurij’s cock, while her eyes never stopped looking at him and her mouth whispered: “As long as these work for me when I want them to work, you have nothing to worry about.”

In fact her words had quite the different effect. Now Jurij was indeed worried that Alessia might replace him as soon as&nbsp; she would find a better toy to fulfill her needs. So far Jurij had hoped that Alessia would also would want to keep him around her for his inner values like his charm, his wisecracks and his commitment to her, but now he wasn't so sure about that anymore.
Fortunately his worries got quickly distracted by the ongoing strokes of her warm hand. They felt so good! So good that Jurij had to close his eyes to fully take in the enjoyment Alessia's hand was causing. He felt that he rather should be grateful about this precious moment than worried about the unknown future.
But then Alessia's hand released his cock as suddenly as she had began to play with it.

“Go and get ready for the day!” was all Alessia said for an explanation. Jurij's whole body of course was still turned on by her previous tease. The bitter realization that he could do nothing to make Alessia continue her gentle teasing&nbsp; left him in a pure state of helpless frustration.
Alessia seemed to even enjoy the look of despair in his eyes as she widely grinned back at him. 

“You better hurry to get ready!” she reminded him.

“Today I want to get as far to Saratovskaya as we can. We are traveling with three of us now and you, my dear, are the bottom of the barrel. Therefore if Nadja tells you to do something, you are to do as she tells you.. Am I understood, mal’chik?”
Still sexually charged up by Alessia's recent gentleness, these iron words of her hit Jurij like a hammer.

“Yes, Alessia. As you wish.”

As Jurij began to walk away Alessia added: “And Mal’chik!? I don’t need to tell you to leave your penis alone, do I?”

“No, Alessia! Of course not”

Alessia smiled hearing him say those words. She also felt her pussy dampen a little by the thought that his pleasure was firmly at her will by now.
Half an hour later Alessia, Nadja and Jurij started walking. The first few kilometers they walked in silence, Alessia was the first to speak. “Nadja, pick up the pace and walk ahead two strides.”

Nadja did as she was asked, Alessia spoke very quietly to Jurij.

“Nadja wants me to make an exchange with her. She has offered me seven days of complete submission, in exchange for one day with you as her personal sex slave. I am considering the offer. What do you think about that?”

“What? She must have been joking!”

“She isn’t!”

“But who does this woman thinks she is? She can’t treat me like cheap meat after all I have done for her. And I am&nbsp; surely not for rent!”

“You soon might be!”

“What? But...&nbsp; She is still the ex-girlfriend of my cousin Mikael - so every intimacy between us would be absolute weird. You surely wouldn't accept such a humiliating offer! You should reject her and I promise I will never speak to the ungrateful bitch again.”

“Don’t tell me what I should do! All I have asked for was your opinion!”

“Sorry! It is just.... I mean, what would Nadja want me to do during this one day of servitude anyway? And what kind of use would you have for seven days of complete submission from Nadja? What could a unreliable woman like her offer you what you can not also get from me?”

“Oh – I have my ideas! Be sure of that! In fact I am indeed thinking this might make a nice arrangement. Of course you would be required to do anything she asks of you. So I was thinking you and I could make a trade: your obedience in exchange, I perhaps would allow you one orgasm, and if you were really a good mal'chik, I might even let you cum in my hand.”

“I don’t know. Somehow this whole deal scares me.”

“There is nothing to be scared of, my mal’chik. Actually it might help you to accomplish my superiority over your fate. And if you behave well, you might even benefit from this deal. Besides you don’t really have any say in the matter. Don’t forget, we will be seeing Nastasija again - you wouldn’t want to irritate me before that encounter, would you?”

“No, Commandress! I surely would not want to do that.”

They continued their walk in silence until they reached a small clearing.

Alessia spoke up: “Well – I think all three of us should leave the track of refugees behind&nbsp; now. Instead we will make camp here, at the back of the clearing by the wood line.” 

With that Nadja, Jurij and Alessia cleared a spot to make a fire and to place the makeshift tent. When that was completed Alessia looked at Jurij and said: “I want all of your clothes back, mal’chik.” 

He began to undress as soon as the words came from her lips. He handed all of his clothes to her and was told to go and find water. Again he did as she instructed. Nadja was sent with clothes to fetch wood, while Commandress began to make a fire.&nbsp; When both had returned, Alessia smiled at them and said “I have a couple of things I need to take care of, Jurij, get me your ropes from my bag.”

Jurij did as she bade and handed them to her.&nbsp; “Follow me Jurij.”&nbsp; He followed her to a tree and was tied to this tree, hands up above his head, cock hard as a rock.&nbsp; She grabbed his balls gently and said “You be a good mal’chik while I am gone.”

Then she turned and looked at Nadja… ”I need a babysitter nerjacha, you will watch him, but do not touch him and do not speak to him, you still have a few hours before he is yours.”
Nadja got an evil smile across her face and replied: “Yes Commandress, as you wish.”

Alessia was gone for hours, and Nadja did just the opposite of what she was told. Jurij just stood there, with his cock sticking straight out, hard as a rock.&nbsp; Nadja kept herself busy by the fire, awaiting Alessia’s return. But after about an hour, Nadja was bored, so she walked over to Jurij.

“Would you like to be untied?” she asked.

“No!” was his clear reply.

“Really? That is too bad, Jurij.”&nbsp; She walked closer to him and pinched one of his nipples hard, pulled and twisted at the same time until Jurij cried out. Then she did the same thing to his other nipple again. Once more he cried out.&nbsp; 

“Are you sure you don’t want to be untied?”

“Yes, I am sure. My Commandress won’t allow it.” 

“Oh – your Commandress won’t allow it! That’s sweet! Totally stupid, but still sweet!” Nadja mocked her bound victim, before she walked toward the fire and sat down to read a book.

Around one hour of mutual ignorance later Jurij spoke up: “I have to pee.”&nbsp; 

Nadja shrug his plea at first, but when he got louder the second time, she said: “NO! You didn’t want me to untie you…you can wait, or piss all over yourself! I don’t care which alternative you choose.” 

“Come on, Nadja! I NEED to pee! Please!”

With that she got up, walked over to him and punched her fist directly into his stomach.

“I said NO! Instead you better use this opportunity to re-consider the consequences of your reluctance, so that you maybe will be more agreeable towards me next time!”&nbsp; 

Jurij coughed and choked a minute, trying to gain his composure. The punch to the gut hadn’t made the feeling the fullness of his bladder any easier to bare, but he knew at this point he must await Alessia’s return or she would be very angry with him. He began to try to think of other things, however no thought could take his mind off his need to urinate. All he could think about was the last time he had peed without her permission.

He couldn’t let such a situation happen again! So once more he begged: “Please forgive me if I should have disrespected you in any way, Nadja! Just tell me what I can do to change your mind!”

His offer was answered by a hard slap across his face.

“Don’t you call me just ‘Nadja’ anymore. You will address me as ‘Miss Nadja’ from now on! And I think, I have a new name for you too, Jurij. From now on you will be the ‘Little cousin of an asshole’. “

As she glanced to his cock she added : “And believe me : When I say little, I do mean little.&nbsp; In the heat of the moment I might shorten your name to ‘asshole’s cousin’.&nbsp; But I will always be thinking LITTLE.&nbsp; No wonder she hasn’t let you fuck her yet. She has toys bigger than you. Don’t you agree?”

“I am afraid I have to, Miss Nadja!”

“Well said! So let’s still try to make it a little bigger!” she grinned and began stroking his member in her delicate hand. He looked down and watched her teasing his helpless shaft. Soon his whole body tensed, he felt so on edge of cumming as well as of pissing.

"Please!" he warned, "I am so close!"

“And so?”

“Alessia wouldn’t allow me to cum nor to piss!”

“That’s hardly my problem, is it?”

He couldn't help but thrust his hips, fucking her silken fist, the head of his cock was swollen and purple and weeping drops of fluid.

Then he saw stars. Roaring in pleasure he shot jet after jet of white foam onto Nadja's hand, 
dripping down Nadja’s fingers. She held that hand to his mouth and raised one eyebrow. In response Jurij dutifully licked her fingers clean. Fortunately he hadn’t also pissed on them.

Still he grew more and more worried about his committed crime of having an unauthorized orgasm.

“Please don’t tell Alessia about it!”

"Well, we will see how you will behave towards me in the future!” Nadja answered with a wicked grin, secretly enjoying any second of Jurij’s rising anxiousness.

“Why are you treating me this way?”

“Because I can treat you this way, Jurij! Just because I can!” she laughed and walked away. Jurij felt so desperate, still he somehow managed to at least don’t piss over himself.

It was already beginning to get dark again when Alessia finally arrived back at the campfire. Jurij was so relieved he almost wet himself right there. Alessia walked over to him and asked “Good to see you again, my mal’chik. I hope you have behaved yourself?” 

He needed to look at the ground when he answered: “Yes Commandress, I have! But I desperately have a certain need. May I please be untied so that I may?” 

It amused Alessia to see that Jurij got still embarrassed by such things in front of her. Nevertheless she wouldn't let him get away with it as easy as that. “You have a certain need for WHAT?” she dug.

“I... I... I need to pee!”

“So pee!”

“But...” Jurij stuttered so helplessly that Alessia decided it was time to show some mercy with him. She untied him and he instantly run off into the woods. When he returned back at camp, Alessia said to him with a big smile on her face “My boots are dirty! Will you please take care of that for me, mal'chik?”

As Jurij knew by now that this was a purely rhetorical question, he dropped to his knees in front of Alessia's boots and started to polish them with utter care. Five minutes later he finished his work with a devoting kiss on their leathern surface as by now he knew that was expected as well.

In the meantime Nadja had began to build up the fire and cook on several items of food that she had found in Alessia's saddle bag.

As they all gathered together to eat Alessia almost casually hinted at Jurij: “After dinner I have something for you. Something that will help you to remember that you are mine. It is also meant as a symbol to Nadja and anyone else that your flesh is already be claimed by me exclusively!”
During the rest of the eating Jurij couldn’t help but wonder what it is that Alessia would have in store for him. 

It still took more than one hour until Alessia sent Nadja away to wash the dishes. Left alone with Jurij Alessia looked over at Jurij and said "Jurij, come kneel here in front of me.” 

When he had dropped to his knees in front of her, she dropped her trousers, roughly grabbed his head and pull his nose right against the lips of her pussy.
“I would like you to lick me, right here.” she ordered and his tongue gently started to caress her swollen clitoris. Eagerly Jurij let his lips and tongue explore the hilly landscape of her pussy, but even after ten minutes she still had not reached an orgasm. 
“You're useless!” she quietly started to berate him. Her words were to quite for Nadja to hear, but they still stung deeply into Jurij's heart.
“If you don't hurry up to please me much better and&nbsp; make me cum, I will have to let Nadja suck my pussy instead.” Alessia's demanding voice threatened from above.
Not wanting to give Alessia a reason to turn to Nadja, Jurij desperately put all energy that was left inside him into his work. Still he was unable to make Alessia cum.

“ENOUGH, mal'chik!"&nbsp; It’s obvious you aren’t putting your heart in this. Go and stand by the tree, I have tied you to earlier.”

“But…”&nbsp; he began to intervene, just to get instantly interrupted: ”But nothing, mal’chik! I said GO stand by the tree. N-O-W!” 

Although Jurij didn't dare to say another word, he still tried to let his pleading look convince Alessia to give him a second chance. But all he archived was that Alessia got up and kicked her heavy boot sole right at his left calf.
Jurij stumbled a little as he felt the stinging pain of the kick, knowing that it would left a pretty blue spot on his leg.
After this total defeat he went to the tree. As soon as he arrived at his requested destination, he turned around to watch how Nadja moved in to the spot between Alessia's legs and began to suck on her pussy.
Jurij couldn't stop thinking about how her role as his supposed friend had dramatically changed within a few hours to his competitor for Alessia's favor. And Nadja didn't even seemed to have any problem with that fact.

Suddenly Alessia spoke up: “Do not look at me! You may stare at the tree I am going to tie you to…but as poorly as you performed tonight, you even don’t deserve my sight.”

Obediently starring at the structure of the tree, Jurij's thoughts moved back to the kick he just had received. Although Jurij hadn't actually seen it, he got aroused just by mentally picturing how Alessia's long leg must have kicked out at him and how the exclusive black leather of her boot rammed itself into his ass.
It only took a few more moments before he heard Alessia moaning.

“That’s it, Nadja... Right there… Make me cum.” she finally started to cry out in extacy. Jurij couldn't look at the tree any longer but had to catch a glimpse at his beloved Alessia. Like he had feared she was receiving a head job from Nadja. Her hands were buried under Nadja's long hair, pressing Nadja's head deeply into her crotch.

When Alessia had caught her breath from her climax she got up and walked back to Jurij. In her hands she hold her wet panties.
Without saying a single word she slipped her panties over Jurij’s head, making him look even more silly, but also effectively blindfolding him. Then she pushed him back up against the tree and tied his hands behind its trunk.
The noose was placed around his neck and pulled up over a strong branch until Jurij had to stand on his tippy toes.
During all that time Jurij's senses got maddened by the intoxicating scent of her panties and the all-too-close&nbsp; presence&nbsp; of her still unreachable body.

She reached out and grabbed his cock, which stayed disappointingly limp from Jurij's recent orgasm. Fortunately for Jurij, Alessia didn’t notice the difference yet. She just began to stroke his cock slowly and spoke. “Mal'chik, remember I told&nbsp; you I had a present for you…first I am going to allow you to orgasm in my hand…and then you will get your surprise, but I need your cock to be soft and since I have not permitted an orgasm, I don’t believe your cock will soften without one.&nbsp; So relax and enjoy my hand.”&nbsp; She stroked his member and after a while, when he still had not cum…the look on Alessia’s face began to change, she began stroking his cock, harder, trying to milk the cum out of him, to no avail. The longer she stroked him, the more her face changed.&nbsp; 

“You are pathetic Jurij…first you can’t make me cum, now you even can’t cum at my wish!”

She ripped off the blindfold and glared at him. Her eyes told him in a very direct way that she was totally pissed off. Knowing he still would have to tell Alessia the truth about his unpermitted orgasm left him nothing but scared. In fact he was so scared&nbsp; that he even began to loose his hard on. 

“See what I mean, mal’chik? U S E L E S S ! Oh well, you had your chance. But as your pathetic cock is limp now, I might change my plan a little! So here we directly go with the next step!” Alessia declared in a cold voice and held up the Kali’s teeth bracelet.

“What... What is that?” a visibly worried Jurij stuttered.

“That is a Kali's teeth bracelet named after the Hindu goddess Kali. It is a chastity device especially made for men like you and it consists of this lockable metal ring with these little spikes on its inner surface. I will secure it around the shaft of your penis. When you’re penis begins to erect, the spikes press into its soft
tissue and cause you the right amount discomfort to remind you that pleasure is only permitted with consent of me. As I hold the key, you can only get hard when I want you to be hard.”

Before Jurij could even think about an adequate form of protest, Alessia had already placed the KTB around his cock and locked it.

“But... But...” Jurij started to complain.

“Shut up, mal'chik!“ Alessia snapped back. “This is for your benefit as the teeth inside the KTB will always tell you of who this cock belongs to, even while your body gets borrowed towards Nadja. So I suggest you stop sniveling and get on with it.”

For a moment their eyes locked but Jurij was never going to be a match for Alessia. A moment later he dropped his head, silently accepting her judgment.
With that Alessia produced a small padlock and Jurij heard the click as it closed, locking the device on him. The padlock key was already on a fine chain and Alessia slipped it around her neck so that the key disappeared beneath the cleavage of her blouse.

“So we are done! You should have no problems going to the toilet.”

Jurij was speechless. The whole thing had happened too fast. As if in some sort of bad dream, he now found himself with his trousers around his knees and his penis clamped in this infernal device. His mouth opened and closed a couple of times but nothing came out.

“I see you like it!” Alessia mocked him in cruel triumph. “I even start to believe you will find the KTB quite comfortable, unless you get excited of course. So let’s see your face when your cock gets hard in there for the first time!” 

She grabbed his shaft and began to caress it until his cock was starting to swell. The ruthless teeth pierced the skin of his cock. Alessia noticed the desired expression of pain at&nbsp; Jurij’s face and smiled to herself knowing full well what was causing it. 

“Yes, that will do quite nicely.”&nbsp; Alessia spoke up “Now, we have wasted enough time sorting out your personal problems. It is to turn you over to Nadja for her 24 hours. But remember: Nadja is not to be upset in any way. Do I make myself quite clear?”

“Very clear. I won't let you down!” Jurij replied, wondering just what was going to be involved.

“Nadja, he is all yours…24 hours…and he better be returned to me unharmed.”

“Thank you, Commandress. Will you be staying here?”

“No Nadja, I will be going up the road a little. Good bye mal’chik, enjoy your time with Nadja and you and I will discuss, your orgasm, when you are returned to me.” 

“So welcome to my reign, little mal’chik! There are so many interesting games we could play. You’d like that, wouldn’t you?” were Nadja’s last words Alessia heard before she walked away into the night.


[ WAKING UP ]
At the same time, but at a very different place Mikael was just awaking. The bright light made him blink at first. Only slowly the room came swimming back into view. 

He appeared to be sitting on some kind of wooden chair. He had a sudden urge to stand up and get away from this foreign place, but his arms were tightly joint to the chair by some thick rope. The rope also wound around each leg, sealing ankles, calves and thighs to the chair legs.
Some softer cloth (a scarf or something similar) was encircling his neck, holding his head erect and still. Anxiously he let his gaze wander around as much as the cloth around his neck was allowing him to.

Off to one side Mikael saw another wooden chair. Behind it was a heavy iron door marked with a painted cross in black color. Beside the door stand an old wooden table. A grouping of sinister-looking laid on its surface. Mikael blinked, squinting across the distance and trying to pick out identifiable items in the odd conglomeration. Goggling at it, Mikael's imagination running riot, but in the end he just couldn't recognize what kind of objects were placed there.
The rest of the huge rectangular room was empty, just bare concrete floor and air-filled space. Mikael also saw boarded-up windows on the other side of the room, but they were too well away from him to look through.

Suddenly he heard the echoing sound foot-steps coming from behind the heavy iron door.
Then the sound stopped and the door opened slowly. Nastasija appeared back into Mikael's life. And so were those smirking hazel eyes. The woman seemed to be even more beautiful than he had remembered her.

Her slim waist was flattered by a wide leather belt with the Red Star of the Bolshevik shining on its bucket. This time she didn't wear a jacket. A crisp white blouse was cinched and gathered by the heavy belt instead. A pair of black trousers in the uniform style of the ex-Czaristic army completed her image.
In her hand she held a riding crop and a leather strap, both of them showing signs of use.
Mikael felt a new the urgent pulsing in his pants.

She walked right to the empty chair that stood next to him and sat down. 
Without paying any attention to him, she lifted her feet and let them rest right on his lap.

Marveled by the hurting impact she caused him, when her heavy soles dug into the soft skin of his upper legs, Mikael tried hard to control his breathing. Immediately he found his eyes dropping to her boots. They were of the finest grade of leather, a soft jet-black. Flat-heeled, they climbed nearly thirty centimeters up along her calves.

In a most casual gesture Nastasija leaned forward and started to undo the metal buckles of the boots.
Slowly her legs slid out of the boots. Nastasija made pretty sure that her prisoner got a good view when she got her feet out of her socks. And her effort surely had the desired effect, as Mikael got even more aroused at the sight of the lithe, tanned legs.

But then she just placed her bare feet back on his lap, grabbed a small bottle out off the pocket of her trouser and began to painting her toe-nails. One by one.
He wanted to talk to her, but behind the tightly bound scarf his tongue could only muffle. Nastasija didn't let herself disturbed by these noises. After he had seen the crop in her hands, Mikael expected all kind of physical torture from this woman, but definitely not being fully ignored by her. In fact he didn't even feel like a real captive, but more like a handy piece of furniture. Being just too unimportant to be even looked at. 
This was emotional torture at his worst.

When the last of her toe-nails was finally painted, Nastasija leaned back, lifted one of her long legs and hold its toes just directly under Mikael's nose. As his mouth was effectively gagged, he had to breathe through his nose and so his breathing would automatically dry the freshly applied paint of her toes. 

But the intimidating closeness of this feminine foot invaded Mikael's personal space. He shook his head in urgent denial, voicing unequivocally his objection to such a depraved intent, and for the first time he really began testing his shackles. They were remorselessly tight of course. In his current position all he could do was squirming. So he squirmed, but it only caused some malicious grin at Nastasija's face. Still she didn't care enough for him to even look into his pleading eyes. All she seemed to care of was the styling of her toes. Had his fate no meaning for her at all? Why didn't she want to ask him about his illegal weapon-sales? After all she wanted to talk to him about 'business-matters' when she had visited him in Pavel's house. So why didn't she ask him now? Still there was just this invulnerable aura of superiority around Nastasija, which made her indifference towards him appear as a natural matter of course.

After a few more minutes of enduring her smelling feet, Nastasija slid her feet back into her boots and walked out of the room - without even paying him a slight glimpse.

Then a dead silence invaded the room and Mikael started to worry who would come next into this room. Nastasija seemed to have enough fun with him already. But how long would Mikael have to helplessly wait here now? And who would be his next 'visitor'? Whoever it was - he probably wouldn't be so attractive. He pictured himself being inquired by an old and unpleasant commissioner. Or maybe a group of drunken and rude Red Soldiers who would torture him?
A very uncomfortable feeling rose up inside Mikael's body. In the same speed his hopes to be soon released in an unharmed state sank into insignificance.

The series of empty hours, waiting helplessly for someone to come, were endless. Nobody seemed to care for him in here. If his neck was not so tightly constricted to the chair, it would have drooped. The scarf had all but dried up in his mouth. His bladder was full. Welts patterned his arms. His muscles were sore from struggling and his joints ached from being sealed in place. Still silence and emptiness were the only witnesses of his misery.

Mikael didn't know how long he'd been strapped to the chair when the iron door finally opened again. Relieved of the boredom in his head, Mikael gasped behind his gag. Thank goddess, it was Nastasija again. He had never been happier to see someone. And she never looked more beautiful to him than before.

"Happy to see me again, my secret lover?" Nastasija grinned as she discovered the relief in Mikael's eyes.

Mikael nodded enthusiastically. She hadn't forsaken him! And this time she finally spoke to him again. Mikael felt unbelievably grateful to her.

"So let me take that mean old scarf off your mouth first!"

As she slowly peeled the silken cloth from his mouth, Mikael gazed longingly into her hazel eyes. Being at the mercy of such a woman with such cute eyes definitely couldn't be that bad.

"Ugh! What . . .&nbsp; Where am I?" 

She smiled at him with perfect teeth. "You are in the headquarter of the regional Soviet. But haven't I told you that already just before you got arrested? So welcome to our interrogation-room 3F!"

"But...? What will happen to me here?" 

"You are not really one of the brightest, are you?" Nastasija laughed at his question with genuine amusement. Her peals making his head throb with pain.

"I will ask you a couple of questions concerning your case. Then I write down a protocol of my interview with you and let the Council decide about the appropriate treatment of your fault." 

'That doesn't sound too bad!' Mikael found himself thinking. After all he regarded his 'fault' as rather minor. Nastasija had walked up to the table in the meantime. Slowly she turned around and smirked at him.
Mikael smiled back at her - at least until his gaze had wandered down and he had noticed that razor-edged hunting-knife in her fingers. She kept smirking at him for a while, observing his rising nervousness.

A moment later she moved toward her prisoner and sat on his unresisting lap, resting her full weight on his thigh until Mikael could feel the warmth of her buttocks radiating against him. She held her face close to his and idly played the knife-point across his cheek. 

Mikael started to tremble when his wide eyes locked on the blade.

"In fact it might be several hours before I will finish my interview, so why don't you get more comfortable?" She giggled, bringing the blade down to slice through his shirt. He felt the cold metal on the puckering point of his nipple. 

Mikael senses were lost in between fascination and fear towards her extraordinary torturess. And his breathing even quickened as the knife began to take away pieces of his shirt.

"So tell me, Mr. Alexandrovich: To which of your honorable customers have you sold the weapons that you could finagle within the last three months."

"Finagle??? I have officially bought them from the ex-czaristic army. Maybe for a very reasonable price, but still..." Mikael eagerly tried to claim his innocence. But Nastasija wasn't interested in his excuses at all. Except a short shrugging of her shoulders she didn't showed any reaction to his pleas. She just continued striping the exposed parts of his arms and back. Slits across the nipples. Slashes up the seams. The collar trimmed away.

Mikael started to panic: "So what do you want from me?"

"The names! Just the names!" his torturess calmly answered in her sweetest voice.

Although Mikael was tempted to share some details of his glorious deals with Nastasija her, he knew that he would have no more use for her after he had made his confessions. Then she had no reason to spare his life.
Therefore Mikael's lips remained sealed and Nastasija soon continued her playful tailoring. But this time her knife sliced slowly through the inner seams of his pants, exposing his strong pale thighs. As she trimmed the material away from his crotch, his penis flopped out, flaccid against the fabric of his white briefs. She grasped it and let the tips of her fingers slowly run over its surface.
Instinctively Mikael winced back, but her hand had already firmly grabbed its prey and wouldn't release it anymore. So all Mikael could do was to endure this intimate massage with a kind of embarrassed breathlessness. His mind felt abused and treated like cheap meat, but apparently his penis had no objections to being remotely controlled.

Nastasija indeed squeezed and pinched the sensitive skin of his penis with an amazing level of professionalism, grinding it between her fingers as though searching for the proverbial bone. But then she relented and pushed it down sharply. Pitilessly she held him there, smiling at Mikael's very first groans, and then quickly released the tension, snatching back her hand to observe and judge the eagerness and resilience of his spring back upright.

Mikael focused to strain skyward, silently begging for more gentle attention.

"Still want to flirt with me, Mr. Alexandrovich?" Nastasija marveled a little silkily. "Or should I say: Mr. Casanova?"

Mikael's brain wanted to resist this humiliating mockery, but his flesh was weak. And as long as he wouldn't answer her question, her pleasure-bringing hand would stay idle. All too soon his longings for her touch overpowered his mind and Mikael nodded his head.

Nastasija laughed at him in triumph: "I'm fine with some little flirting! But take care - sometimes I'm like a cobra: beautiful but also poisonous. And from time to time the cobra in me likes to bite. The ones who got bitten by me are always going to die by my poison!"

Mikael gasped in shock, locking into her eyes. Her voice was low and even. She wasn't joking!
Inside Mikael's head hundreds of thoughts were wondering what he could do to not bring out the 'cobra' in Nastasija. But despite his best efforts, Mikael's penis started to thicken inside her manipulating fist until it strained against her sharp finger-tips. 

"Hmm! This little thing of yours seems to enjoy itself." she smirked, pointing on his penis-head with the blade of the knife that still rested in her other hand.

Watching him jump and waggle, a giggle of almost girlish delight escaped her. 
But suddenly she released the fist around his penis and grabbed his balls instead, quickly wrapping them around the viciously gleaming blade.

"Even although I don't think that you have earned yourself any enjoyment yet." 
 
Mikael’s hips buckled as he fully realized of his extreme vulnerability. His tender gonads were at the mercy of her cold blade - capable or tearing them free from their thin external sack. His cock almost spasmed by this thought, but somehow Mikael managed to limit himself to a single strangled gasp.

Nastasija was already moving her attention down to his drawn-up and quivering balls, palpating each of his testicles. Mikael stopped breathing. His tempted mind was like in trace and all he cared for was his lust. His eyes ogled her breasts as she bent forward to roll his balls through her thumb and fingers. Bad luck for him that Nastasija caught this bold gaze of him. Promptly Mikael earned himself a roundhouse slap across the face. While he savored the flaming pain, he heard her hiss in a cold and deadly voice: 

“Show respect! I want you to treat my body like a great work of art and not some smutty cheap centerfold. If I catch you looking at me again and see crawling, greedy lust instead of admiring awe, I am liable to get exceedingly violent. So admire me, Prisoner! ...and admire well."

Awoken from his trance, Mikael looked back at her in sorrowful shame. He silently thanked god, when Nastasija nodded, provisionally satisfied with his reaction, and moved the blade away. She stood up, laid the knife on a table behind her and returned to her victim. This time she held a thin leather strap in her hand. Slowly she knelt down in front of him and began to wound the strap about the base of his genitalia.

“That should keep you from indulging in any unauthorized ejaculation during the upcoming interrogation.” Nastasija announced.

"But unfortunately for you, I desire more from my prisoners than just be excluded from any pleasure. I want to see a real play of emotion flitting across their stupid faces when they finally realize exactly that their body won't survive me treatment." 

Her words confused Mikael. What did she mean? Nastasija was going to show him. In utter calmness she grabbed both ends of the strap and pulled it even deeper into his sensitive skin. Mikael cried out in pain, feeling his balls being squashed like grapes.

"This is more like what I desire! Now the leathern strap is snapped so tightly into place that it prevents the passage of fluid in either direction. This serves to trap the blood, ensuring an erection of unlimited duration. But it also ensures that your cock will turn blue and slowly die off within the next five hours. Then you will know what it feels like to be a eunuch."

Mikael started to freak out: "Please! Take it off! Please!!!"

"Sorry, it's just too late to save your cock. But if you tell me the names of all your customers you still might save the other parts of your body!" Nastasija grinned back at him while she straddled herself on one of his bound thighs.

"The cock hurts, doesn't it?" she mocked. "So try to concentrate yourself this time and tell me what I want to know."

Although Mikael still couldn't really comprehended the full meaning of the prospect of loosing his valuable penis, he comprehended the absolute necessity of co-operating with Nastasija if he didn't want to end his life as a cripple. So he tried to co-operate: "Okay...okay... It's an ex-supplier of the Czaristic army called Shirkow. Igor Shirkow! After the revolution he has used his old contacts to sell the remaining weapons of the Russian Imperial Army to everyone who would offer him a good price. But after a few weeks he was sold out. That was when I asked for my delivery-services."

"You see: that wasn't too hard to tell, was it? So how many weapons have you sold him?"

"I don't know anymore. Maybe five-hundred rifles, some dozens of grenades and several boxes of ammunition."

"How did you get access of so many weapons?"

"I asked several people who asked other people again. But I don't remember their names anymore!"

She slid her hands inside his shirt, widening the rips until her fingers found his nipples. Then the cruel nails grasped and pinched until Mikael gasped in pain.

"Try harder to remember!"

Mikael kept silent and her cruel nails twisted his nipples hard. This time he had to cry out loud, causing Nastasija to smile again.

Perhaps it was the gleam in her eyes every time she made him scream that caused his growing fear.

"They are just average people like everyone. So they have everyone's name: Vladimir, Misha, Ivan, Andrew... It's impossible to list all of them up!" Mikael eager tried to save his skin.

Without the bat of an eyelid she leaned forward and tauntingly asked him: "Have you ever been whipped before?"

Mikael knew that this was more a rhetorical kind of question. Still his answer would have been 'No'. He only knew whippings from the old adventure books about the Romans which he had read as a small boy. It had been thrilling to imagine the helpless pain that the poor victim must had felt. But never would Mikael have thought that his own skin might be whipped some day. Now the shine of cruelty in Nastasija's eyes made him quickly understand that a hard whipping was approaching for him. Furthermore the discomfort of having his erection crushed by the strap and his body tied to the chair pitilessly remembered him of the fact that he would be absolutely unable to stop Nastasija's riot.
He shivered in anxious anticipation, trying to face the inevitable. How much pain would he be able to bear, before breaking and begging Nastasija for mercy? And of course, what would happen after that? 

But before Mikael could find any answers, his questions of the past and immediate future were flashed away in the white hot flare of Nastasija's first slash. Mikael couldn't remember how the long dressage-crop had come into Nastasija's hand, but it had left a rememberable stripe across his right hip and buttock.
Mikael gasped and grunted when Nastasija slashed a second stripe down, overlapping the first. Then another. And another. And another.

A first he just pressed his teeth together, trying to absorb each excruciating blow like persistently repetitive lightening strikes. As if to prove him wrong, they struck the same general spot again and again, sending out thrilling little tingles throughout his entire nervous system. His toes curled and his&nbsp; scalp began to prickle.

“How do you like it, huh, imperialistic prick?" grunted Nastasija, her crop whistling down.

Mikael managed to open his eyes between two more blows.

"It's rather unpleasant!" he downplayed the biting pain in biting irony. Then another successive smack sent him wincing back into himself.

"So how do you think the socialist people will like it, being threatened by weapons that you have sold to their enemies? You think any of them would think of it as pleasant? Well I think I owe you a little payback, my greedy war-profiteer. And I don't think just a simple whipping is going to do it."

Mikael tried to form the words that would defend himself. He tried to get them out. But each word
his trapped tongue shaped now came hissing out in a kind of strangled scream, as faster and more vigorous blows continued to fan the cumulative fire that had replaced his upper thighs and buttocks.

Nastasija loomed over him, her gorgeous breasts dancing as she wielded her crop. On her forehead Mikael made out fresh pearls of sweat. They made her look even more beautiful. Mikael could only adore her.
Still the endless blows continued to fall down on him. And despite the arousal in Mikael's brain, his sensible flesh tried eagerly to escape the outrageous pain.

“Hold still, Mr. Alexandrovich! Don't you dare to move or you will get this!”

The next vicious crack of her her dressage-crop exploded exactly onto his bound genitals. Mikael screamed in absolute despair. When Nastasija saw a red line of blood arising straight over his balls, she understood the endless pain Mikael must have suffered at this moment. Just as much as she needed him to suffer to quickly adapt his behavior according to her whims! Soon she would play him like a fiddle. 

But first her victim would have to take a few more arguments from her whip until his feeling of total defenselessness would be refined.
Nastasija closed her eyes and let an endless crescendo of percussive cracks hiss through the air. 

At first Mikael tried to field the slashes of her dressage crop with his inner sensation - savoring each strike as a 'special kind of kiss' from this awesome woman Nastasija. But too soon the fiery burns that each slash surging through his body couldn't be played down anymore. They kept what the were: just extreme fiery burns.

Nastasija on the other hand grew more excited with each strike she delivered. Even she was amazed how much she loved to hear to frantic sounds of suffering her vicious strikes produced. It felt incredible, that so much pain could be inflicted with just a simple leather
crop! As the cracks got louder, Mikael's cries got more tear-stained and her breaths got faster.

Soon Mikael was sobbing unabashedly, listening to Nastasija's contemptuous jibes through a kind of weird, floating, out-of-body haze. The crop swung and swung, for what seemed like an eternity.

“Don't complain, scum!"
Crack!

"You deserve every little strike!"
Crack!

"...because you are a measly..."
Crack!

"...perfidious..."
Crack! 

"...rotten..."
Crack!

"...and desperately fucked-up..."
Crack!

"...piece of imperialistic shit!"
C – R – A – C – K!

At this moment Mikael's tears started to flow without any inhibitions. His nose and mouth spilled out a mixture of snot and saliva. His whole face seemed to be already rubbed in it. Nevertheless, despite the unbelievable pain that Nastasija had caused him, Mikael's locked erect penis still remained a hard and needy constant. His brain might have floated off into detachment, his ravening erection however continued to exult. Nastasija needed to grin at she realized what a downright ridiculous piece of wretchedness Mikael had become under her treatment.

"Still, there is no reason for us to get ahead of ourselves." she calmed herself down. "So have you enjoyed our little flirt?"

"Definitely not!" Mikael hizzed through his teeth that were still pressed together due to the unbelievable pain he had to bearing.

"Why not? Am I not attractive enough any more to have a little flirt with you?" mocked in the sweet innocence of a shy girl.

Mikael realized that he had to be careful to find more pleasing answers to Nastasija's tricky questions, if he didn't want to loose the rest of his skin.

"You are one of the most beautiful women I ever met. I guess, I am just a little awe-strucked by the poisonous cobra inside you."

"Hmm! But is an awe-inspiring woman even more worth to risk a flirt?"

"Well... I suppose!"

"Then you still want to flirt with me?"

Beside all the fear he had developed towards Nastasija's painful flirting, he knew that a wrong answer on this question could mean only even more pain for him.

Mikael's voice creaked and croaked when he hesitantly responded. “Yes!”

"So why have you lied to me before?"

"I... I don't know!... Out of confusion, probably!"

"Confusion?" shot back in played consternation.

"No...! Not confusion!" Mikael quickly intervened. Eagerly trying to find a explanation that would suit Nastasija's mood. Finally he found his saving words: "Intimidation! I didn't dare to continue my flirt with you because I was too intimidated by your overawing beauty and personality!"

"Ah! Poor Mikael! There is no need be to bashful! I am a very kind person. So let me help you: If you want to flirt with a woman, you will have to impress her! Do you want to impress me?"

"Yes!" he spat out, his lips covered with his own blood that was slowly dropping from a fresh welt over his right cheek.

"Okay! Then how could you impress me? . . . You still have not impressed me yet by telling me, from whom you got the weapons you have sold to Igor Shirkow! Have you?"

"No!" Mikael admitted.

"And so?"

As his arms and shoulders were firmly cramped, Mikael's skin shuddered under the relentless assault of her crop. He knew that he wouldn't survive a second outrage of Nastasija. So he closed his eyes and confessed:

"Misha Komerov. Over the very last weeks of the Great War, he had peculated around two percent of every weapon delivery for the Imperial Army of Russia. Due to the struggles of war, no-one had the overview - so no-one was able to supervise him."

"And who else had bought weapons from Misha Komerov?"

"As far as I know I was his exclusive customer!"

"Well - I am indeed impressed by your information! So as your use for me got exhausted now, we can prepare your execution!"

"No!!! Please...."

"Please what?"

"Please let me live. I have told you everything I knew!"

"...and that is exactly the reason why the next step would be your execution!"

"You can't just let me get executed!"

"Oh - I can!" she laughed at Mikael. "What do you want to do about it?" 

"Please... Please let me live!"

The taste of his own blood only clarified Jurij's will of live. Despite all this burning pain inside him, he couldn't just give up now. He had to survive this interrogation! Nastasija however seemed to ruthlessly enjoy his struggling will-power. Slowly she leaned closer, her mocking eyes locked on his. He could feel the warmth of her breath.

"I tell you what: As I think you are kind of cute, I will allow you to postpone your death as long as you keep me entertained!"

Keep her entertained? Mikael wasn't sure what Nastasija meant. He tried to to snatch a peek at her face. He was simultaneously terrified, gratified, and exhilarated by what he saw. Her bright eyes were ablaze with unholy joy and unassuagable hunger. 

But suddenly his glimpse at her was taken, when Nastasija's left hand snaked around his head, found a fistful of hair and pulled his head back fiercely.

“Your body is mine now, imperialist! And that means mine to use in any way I see fit. And right now, I see fit to thoroughly revenge all my comrades who died from weapons that you have delivered."

While her left hand still kept firmly seizing him by the hair, her other hand peeled back Mikael's already stretched open lips, the sharp nails arming the deft fingers honed to the exact correct length to provide maximum dexterity and structural strength.

Mikael could tell that claws like those could rend a hell of a lot of flesh before finally splintering. Then they had just become dangerously jagged. They could rip out a man's throat in under a second. 

"So your only way to keep me from taking my rending revenge on you, is to distract me. And what could be a better distraction than bringing me pleasure?"

Her finger moved on to peering into his ears, sifting through his hair. Then it began to&nbsp; methodically test the shape of skin and muscle all over Mikael's scratch-covered body - a far more rough and fundamentally demeaning going over than any physician had ever administered.
Each time her finger past one of his fresh welts, Mikael felt a stinging pain. He strained to snap his bonds, but as all his thrashing could not dislodge the smothering hand, he forced himself to hold back his tears at least and endure the pain in silence.
When her eyes fixed on his tortured face, Nastasija shuddered by the sight of him pressing his teeth eagerly together. 

Finally she relented, withdraw her teasing finger and cheered at Mikael: “Very well! Apparently you are capable of hold back your own pain to not disturb my lust. That's good, because it is going to be an extremely essential skill for you if you want to enjoy the last moments of your life with less pain. 
Here is another essential skill for you: Tell me, that you love me!" 

Mikael couldn't believe this incredible request he just had heard from Nastasija.

As if to prove the sincerity of her request, Nastasija leaned in, grasped his face and kissed his silent lips. Her tongue run over his upper lip. When Mikael breathed in her perfume, he just had to close his eyes, taking in all the tenderness that Nastasija's warm mouth provided to him. Her touches were just&nbsp; breath-taking. And so bewitching. Soon Mikael's senses got fully lost in Nastasija's young beauty.

"I love you!" Mikael heard himself whisper in reckless dedication. He couldn't help it, as his mind seemed spell-bound by her.

A stinging slap against his cheek abruptly ended her kiss. Mikael's eyes opened in shocked surprise and looked right into Nastasija's crazy laughter.

"You think that you love me? That you really love ME? Oh - what an easy-manipulable fool you are! I might represent the most fatal twist of your poor fate, but I am definitely not for you to love!"

The shrilling sound of her scornful laughter made Mikael almost wince as much as the slap. He felt so utterly ashamed of his boyish manipulability. How could he have been so foolish to let her wrap his mind around her finger and break another fracture into his fragile confidence? He hated himself for that.

But Nastasija didn't care for the hurt emotions of her prisoner. All she cared for was her own enjoyment and so she straddled Mikael, who was too confused to show any resistance. With her other hand she positioned his cock and sank straight down onto it in one lunge. Now she had once more Mikael's full attention.

When she leaned forward to lick the salty wetness from his eyes, Mikael flinched as much as his bonds 
would allow. She laughed again. It was a soft, malevolent giggle that echoed in Mikael's mind when her sex slowly slid up and down his shaft.

"Isn't it a pity that the leathern strap is tied so firmly around your cock, Mr. Alexandrovich?" she purred. "Because now your cock will stay hard and ready for me even though will be so much harder for you to come!"

Just a moment ago Mikael had sobbed hard in his unfulfilled need for release; now his hurt pride made him suppress every outrage for lust.

Nastasija didn't care. She knew that despite the bound prisoner's objections, sooner or later his pathetic horniness would defeat his self-control and then she would have even more fun playing with his broken mind, taunting and teasing it until Mikael would be in sheer torture.
But first comes the 'work', Nastasija told herself and began engulfing just half Mikael's shaft with her warm pussy. Their glossy lips stretched eagerly around his most sensitive flesh. Small up-and-down rhythmic thrusts worked magic, stroking new life into her trembling toy. All too soon she heard Mikael moan out loud. Still the leathern strap denied him the final satisfaction.

Nastasija grinned: "On the other hand: You can be grateful that the strap only helps you to control yourself, because I would have to slice your cock off with my little knife, if I see you coming before I had found my pleasure!" 

Mikael starred at her with wide-opened eyes. Just to remind him of how much she was capable of making this threat come true, Nastasija took his ear between her teeth and bit down hard, the resultant scream making her moan and grind harder against him. 

“Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhh, yeah! That's it, my poor imperialist! Struggle to bring me pleasure! I just hope that this fuck feels as good for you as it feels for me.”

Mikael had never believed that a woman could actually rape a man, but from this moment on, Mikael knew differently.
After using him for coming a second time, it seemed as if she was wetter than she had ever been before. But now she needed time to relax. With a big grin on her face she let her pussy disengage from the cock, climbed off and appraised her well-broken prisoner.
And what a beautiful sight he gave! His still unsated penis glistened and throbbed as it jutted from the ruins of his underwear. A sheen of sweat covered his entire body. 

'Just one more little game I want to play with him.' she smiled to herself and walked behind the chair. Placing her booted feet at the base of the chair legs, she grasped his shoulders and levered the chair back, using her feet as fulcrums. As she lowered him to the floor, her grip slipped and the chair fell, cracking his head on the floor with a thunk. 

"Oops! Sorry about that! I hope, I didn't jolt you too badly?"

"Really? Oh, thank you so much!"

Mikael's irony was immediately answered by a hard kick of her boot.

"Shut up and wait until I have finished! I was going to explain to you, that I just might have changed my mind. I won't have you executed."

Although this information hit Mikael by surprise, he knew better than to say another word. A smile of triumph hushed over Nastasija's face when she noticed his submissive silence. But of course, Mikael couldn't see that from his inferior perspective.
All he could see was how one of her foot step over him so that his head got framed by her heavy boots from either side. Mikael couldn't resist the temptation to look up at her in awe. His gaze wandered slowly from the shining blackness of Nastasija's boots to her well-shaped legs, and her flat midriff and finally to her pretty face grinning down at him. She knew very well that from where he was lying, her body would look simply majestic.

“So instead of having you executed, I will keep you here in this room. I won't hurt you more than it is necessary to adapt your behavior. And I am even going to provide you with water and bread. So you actually will be able to survive my way of imprisonment for a long amount of time.”

Mikael just kept starring up at her, neither knowing was do say nor think.

”The sad part of the story is that I won't provide you with anything else. So like a sailing man of the Columbus-age, you will slowly but surely suffer scurvy. Due to a lack of essential minerals and vitamins, you hair will fall out , your muscles will weaken and finally you will also loose your teeth. Then your body will soon be just to wrecked and you will die under my supervision.
So long I will take care that no-one else lays a hand on you. You will become my favorite experiment! Isn't that just great?"

The light of the lamp sparkled in Nastasija's dark eyes. She looked like she would be the devil herself.

“But... that would take months. You... you just can't leave me here for such along time. People will look out for me?”

“Really? I hardly think so! You have no permanent address and your family that had spread itself around whole Southern Russia. No one will miss you. So you're nobody here! But why don't we just try out to keep you here for a couple of months and see who is right in the end?”

“Please! No!”

But Nastasija wasn't listening to him any longer. Instead her thoughts daydreamed away: “Have I already told you that my private quarters are right above this room? So when you finally die from scurvy and your poor soul wants to go to heaven, it have to try getting around me first. And I will take you soul with me into hell!" 

Full-throated and hearty, her mockery echoed in the empty room.

“Please! Have mercy on me!”

“Shut up and look at me!” She wanted his full attention now, he turned his gaze upwards again. She stepped backward and then lowered herself slowly, looking at him all the time. It was like she had hypnotized him, he was unable to do anything but watch this goddess over his life and death lower herself onto his chest. She pinned his upper arms with her shins, knelt over him, carefully placed each of his wrists in the crook of her knees and lowered her full weight onto his chest, thighs gripping his face. 
She sat there, hands on hips, her crotch a few inches from his nose. 

"Comfy, my love?" she asked, voice dark with menacing humor. "I hope so, since I am considering to keep you in this perfectly vulnerable position for the most remaining moments of your pitiful life."

Mikael wanted to speak up, but he was quickly shut up by her left palm firmly sealing up his mouth.

"You better don't utter another word. I still have my knife handy and the way those balls of yours are stretched out, they'd pop off very easily." 

This was the moment when Mikael closed his eyes in total surrender. He now knew for certain that he was going to die here. All hopes in him have died.


[ TWENTY-FOUR HOURS ]

Exactly twenty-four hours later Alessia re-appeared to the scenery of Jurij’s transfer under Nadja’s reign.

She found Jurij’s motionless body, bound by his wrists to the trunk of the tree and his elbows cinched painfully close by his bonds.
His head was bowed down like he was dead.

Quickly Alessia run to him and lifted his head. To her relief Jurij was quietly sobbing and moaning. He was totally outworn, but still alive!
His moaning were quieted by a horse bridle that was firmly locked around his head by a chain. Drool was flowing out of his mouth, mixing with tears falling down his cheeks.
Nadja must have just left him here to stew in his misery.

Alessia felt so sorry for him. Sorry that she had put him at the mercy of a foreign woman without even considering such fatal consequences. But it was too late now. All she could do for him was to untie his ropes and free him from his gag.
As soon as his bound arms had been untied, another shock waited for Alessia: Jurij’s back and ass were covered and criss-crossed all over with very painful looking welts. The welts must have been throbbing and hurting terribly on his flesh as they were still blazing deeply even now.

In the meantime Jurij found back his consciousness.

“Thank god, you are here!” he mumble through the horse bridle, as soon as his half-opened eyes had discovered his Commandress. “Do you have some water? Please! I am so parched!”

Alessia hurried to ungag him, but somehow the bridle wouldn’t come off. It’s solid chain was locked by a padlock to which only Nadja could have the fitting key. Alessia grew nervous. There was just no sight of Nadja nor of any water around. So how could she help him?

“Ah – I remember a little brook just a few minutes from here! Just let me help you up and I will bring you there!”

With his tipsy legs, she had to carry at least half of Jurij’s weight on her shoulders. He was much heavier than she had expected. Only with the mobilization of all her strength she managed to tow him to the brook.

Immediately Jurij dropped to his knees, dragged his whole head into the water and sucked it in even through the interfering bridle.

When his thirst was satisfied, a much more merciful Alessia wanted to free her Jurij from his KTB as well. With eager will she reached for his pants and yanked them down over his still burning thighs, revealing his swollen balls and tortured cock in its KTB restrainer. To Alessia’s horror she had to learn the her key didn’t fit into the padlock anymore. Someone seemed to have glued it with some paste.

“Oh – I see you have already re-found your prisoner! Thanks again for borrowing him to me – we had such a nice time together.” Alessia suddenly heard Nadja’s gleeful voice from behind.

Furiously Alessia turned around and barked: “What have you done?”

“Like I said – we just have had some fun together. No need to freak out!”

“But... What... What on earth did Jurij do to deserve such a rude whipping?”

“He was argumentative, refused to abide by my commands, and he is asshole’s cousin, what more reasons do I need.”

“And how could you leave him like this alone in the wood then?”

“I just wanted him to really appreciate the relentlessly growing burn from the thigh stinger of my crop. But as it’s pain will even slowly intensify over the next few hours before the burning might eventually ease, I needed to give Jurij a little time for himself.”

“Time to recover from the damages you have caused him, you mean! Why does is not surprise me that you have broken our deal to keep Jurij physically unharmed during your custody?”

“But he is physically unharmed, or at least nearly unharmed.”

“Shut your foul mouth! You have broken your pact, you ungrateful bitch!”

“Hey, hey, hey! There is no need to get rude. I haven't broken our pact. I just added a few more bargains to it!”

“If I was planning to be rude, I would have called you an ungrateful whore instead of an ungrateful bitch. Now give me the key to unchain the bridle around his head!”

“Sorry, but I can’t find it anymore.” Nadja replied with a smirk on her face.

“You are just playing for a nice bribe, aren’t you?” 

“Perhaps! So maybe giving me your mare would help me to remember where I have placed the fitting key?”

“What? My mare? You must be kidding? You don’t know the first thing about MY mare”

“I am afraid that I am not kidding, I know horses. You don’t have much possibility to negotiate here. I know that you secretly love your mal'chik more than everything else, I assume that your horse will be a very fair price, don't you agree? So why don’t you just give me your horse. Then you can unrestrain your weepy mal'chik and keep him for yourself. He wasn't such a spectacular toy for me anyway!”

“Fine, If, giving you the mare gets you the hell away from us, take her, but give me the damn key.
But...”

“Of course I also won't be able to spend seven days in your service as we now have become ‘business partners’!”

“Whatever! Just give me this damn key and then get the hell out of my sight!”

Jurij tried to tell Alessia about the glued padlock of his KTB. However Alessia gave him a look like he had never seen before, which to him meant shut up this instant. He wisely chose to not try to talk. Alessia petted him on the head as he quieted down letting him know she was pleased.

“Great!” Nadja cheered. “So bye for now and let me just add that it was a pleasure to make deals with you!” Nadja cheered and turned around – walking right to Alessia’s horse.

Alessia turned around to Jurij and smiled at him sympathetically. 

“Hands behind your hand, my mal’chik!” she gave her order, which was promptly obeyed by Jurij.

After she had unlocked the bridle, Jurij’s weak voice started to mumble: “Thank you, Alessia! Your help came in the last minute. I couldn’t have taken the misery any longer! But how are we going to get me out of the KTB? Nadja had glued the padlock!”

“Oh shit! I have totally forgotten!”

With that she placed her thumb and index finger around the KTB and studied his member intently.

“Maybe I can scratch out the glue with my knife?!”

"Yeah! That could work!" he answered with hope in his voice.

She placed the top of her knife in the lock and turned it around. Jurij’s cock was ready to be freed and his anticipation built up. But all that happened was a load clicking of the blade against the iron of the padlock. 

"Well it seems that we won’t free the padlock from the glue that easily. So I am afraid the KTB will have to stay on. Sorry, my dear!" Alessia suddenly concluded, giving his cock a good shake.

His frustration was showing, his eyes begging, pleading her to give it another try. But she was done with trying. The idea of keeping Jurij locked up without any hope for release was so much fun for Alessia.

With her knife still in her hand, her arms went behind his neck, pulling him closer towards her warm body. He felt the tip of her tongue on his ear lobe and slowly tracing up the outer edge, back down and she whispered in it: "You need to cum real bad don't you, my little mal’chik? You want to feel my hot pussy around that big hard cock don't you?"

“Yes!”

With that she rudely pushed him away and said: “So I better stop making you hot, because there will be only frustration waiting for you in the end!”

Jurij’s mind knew that she was right, still his body couldn’t get enough of Alessia’s teasing.

“Maybe you want to climb into the cold water and see if it ease your painful erection a little! Or are you already to continue our walk southwards?”

“Whichever my Commandress prefers!” was Jurij’s dutiful responded.

She walked over to him, looking him directly into his eyes: “You have few opportunities these days to make choices… Take advantage when a choice if offered.”

“Thank you, Commandress!” he mumbled and climbed into the water. Alessia was correct - his cock began to shrink inside the water. The bad part of the story was that his penis and balls tried to retract when he climbed back out. But there was no avail - the bracelet kept his penis out, painfully reminding him that even now, his cock kept firmly locked.

While Jurij was permitted to wrap up in her blanket, Alessia began to cook the remaining scraps of bread, cheese and dried meat for supper. Every now and then she would walk over to him and bring a new hot stone to put under his blanket to keep him warm. 
Still Jurij couldn’t find any peace. His bruised and battered backside made it hard to lay on his back whilst his locked penis made it hard to lay on his front, but, for all that these disturbed him they were nothing compared with his need for release. His hand strayed to the KTB at his groin but, however much as he tried, his attempts just made it worse.

When the food was ready, Alessia and Jurij sat together by the fire, eating their dinner in absolute silence.

After they had finished, Alessia spoke: “Jurij, I would like to have some nice moments with you if you are feeling up to giving me pleasure.” 

Mikael's cock was yet again starting to swell, but as it filled the KTB again the ruthless teeth bit into it and he sucked in air and grinded his hips. Alessia noticed the deliciously provocative jerking movement and smiled to herself knowing full well what was causing it. 

“I won’t order you to bring me pleasure this evening, but if you would like to, I would enjoy you doing it.”

“Yes Commandress, I would like that, but…may I ask you something first.”

“No you may not. I am not much interested in having conversation, I am however interested in you utilizing your tongue for something else though.”

He dutifully crawled up between her legs. Alessia’s hand firmly planted his head where she wanted it, crying out again and again as his tongue found its mark. After nearly half an hour and several long orgasms, Alessia pushed his head back and lay gasping in the grass that supported her body. 

He had just provided the best orgasms she could remember, even with a pained look on his face the entire time.

After Jurij had almost exhausted her from cumming so many times, she asked: “What’s the sour face for, mal’chik?”

He continued with his tongue service and refused to answer her. She grabbed a handful of his hair pulling hard&nbsp; upward so he was forced to look at her. Jurij’s face was covered in her wetness and his body trembled like it might explode very soon.

“Haven’t you learned by now, when I ask a question, I expect an answer?”

“I have! I really have! But I didn’t want to tell you that my penis hurts so much by the KTB.”

Smiling at his silent misery, Alessia tried to calm: “I know. But in a couple of hours we will arrive in Saratovskaya. There a Red Army unit is holding the town, so we might have a chance to get professional help to solve your little problem. So don’t you worry yourself too much about your locked-up cock. You should better use the remaining time to take some rest.”

Still it took two more hours of resultless worrying until the sheer exhaustion of his mind and body finally allowed Jurij to sleep, painfully on his side - his knees curled in a fetal position. 

[ WELCOME TO SARATOVSKAYA ]
A soft kick woke Jurij before dawn. 

“Wake up, sleepy-head! We have a long day ahead!” Alessia's quiet words came from above. He stood slowly, his entire body shaking. The arms were sore, his legs were stiff and it hurt painfully to move. 

“Hurry up! We’ll have leave now if we want to get to the city of Saratovskaya before dark!” Alessia urged him impatiently while she was helping him to his feet. At the same time she took care that her body would accidentally stroke his organ at every little opportunity there was, so that his swollen balls was soon urging for release and the ache in Jurij's legs became nothing compared to the ache in his testicles. That was the condition Alessia wanted Jurij to bear during their long march.

It was already late in the afternoon when Alessia and Jurij came over the crest of a small hill and finally looked at the roofs of Saratovskaya shining at the horizon. Just a few minutes later they entered the city gate and found themselves in the middle of a busy marketplace which was filled with hundreds of people desperately looking for food. The whole city seemed to be so crowded with begging refugees that the supply of food, water and living quarters must have run out very soon.

“Alessia?” a female voice suddenly shouted out from behind. Alessia and Jurij turned around in surprise and directly looked at a woman dressed in a sophisticated looking red jacket with brass buttons and an oversized pointed collar. Two uniformed bodyguards surrounded her.

“Nastasija! You’re alive!” Alessia cheered.

“I am! And so are you! I am so relieved to see you back! I have worried so much for you since the White Army had taken over Yekaterinodar.”

Grinning as Jurij she added: “And I see you also brought your toy!”

The taunting look of her eyes let Jurij know that he would have to face some very though days in the charge of Nastasija.

Stepping forward, she grabbed his chin and examinated him like a cattle. 

“Would you borrow me your toy someday, Alessia?” Nastasija asked in her most innocent voice. 

Only the though of being left at Nastasija’s mercy made Jurij whimper. To his relief he heard Alessia answer: “Sorry, Nastasija! But I haven’t made such good experiences with borrowing my toy to someone else!”

“Really? That’s a pity! Because I start to think, that Jurij looks even cuter than the Alexandrovich-toy that I got for myself.”

“You got yourself an own Alexandrovich-toy? Who is it?”

“Oh – as I won’t release him into freedom again, I don't care for his name very much!” Nastasija grinned back. Her grin even turned into a laughter as she saw the shock in Jurij's face that her rude comment had just caused! And Jurij was shocked indeed: A member of his family in the hands of this insatiable and unpredictable woman was just too much for him to take!

“What... I mean, how... Where... is this member of my family now?” Jurij finally stammered.

“As long as no-one allows you to ask questions, you better keep you mouth shut!” was Nastasija’s snippy answer before she turned her full attention back to Alessia, leaving Jurij at the mercy of her two bodyguards

The obvious strength and coldbloodness bodyguards intimidate Jurij. They really didn't looked like someone to argue with, at the same time the seemed to be very eager to follow every of Nastasija's commands without question.
Jurij was still thinking about the way Nastasija could have archived such mindless devotion when one of the bodyguards roughly grabbed him by the arm and pushed him to move forward.. Nastasija and Alessia had started a little walk and Nastasija's guards made sure that Jurij would follow them in a ‘respectful’ distance of five meters.
Alessia on the other hand didn't seem to care about Jurij's fate any longer. She was fully lost in her chat with Nastasija and all that was left of her was the sight of her back.
Due to the noises of the market, Jurij could only understand a few fragments of their conversation.

“What an unbelievable coincidence that I meet you again today. Just yesterday I though about you!” he still could Nastasija raving.

“You did? In which situation?” Alessia asked back.

“Oh – it’s a long story! But as we will still have to walk a while, it might entertain you. Yesterday I took my two guards and went hunting for pillagers. At random we came upon a lonely house. As lonely houses are an ideal hiding place for pillagers, I decided for a closer visit. And indeed the look of the front door was freshly broken. I creeped inside and caught a young woman grabbing all food from the kitchen into a wooden box. You should have seen her horrified eyes when I said ‘So you like to pillage…that’s against the law you know, punishable by death.’ !
Then the girl made a terrible mistake : she decided to run away. Quickly I threw her to the ground and tied her wrists behind her back.”

“Wow – she surrendered to you just like that?”

“No! Of course the girl tried to kick me, but soon she had to find out that I would not tolerate that. I stood on top of one foot and lifted the other one straight up. When she felt that she was going to split in two pieces, she started to shriek to not to do that again. So I allowed the foot to rest back on the ground, while I took another rope and tied her feet together. After I had tied her feet to her hands, I asked her whether she preferred a painful and slow or a quick and virtually painless death.”

“How generous from you to leave her this choice!” Alessia giggled.

“Of course there was a price to pay for a quick death. I ordered her to eat my cunt. If she would make me feel good, while I whipped the bottoms of her feet, I would grant her a painless death – otherwise she would have to suffer first.”

“So how has she passed your test?”

“You must know that the house had a porch with railing off its front – so I just had to seize this perfect situation! I picked the girl up by the ropes connecting her ankles and wrists and carried her to the porch. There I untied the connecting rope, pulled her pants down to her ankles and pulled up her half-naked legs upward to tie them to the porch railing. This way she had the optimal position to apply my riding crop to the bottoms of her feet. After twenty strokes I guessed that she would be sufficiently motivated to please me, so I sat down on her face and allowed her to lick my pussy. And indeed, she licked for all she was worth hoping to make me cum. 
Okay – she was not someone you would call professional licker, but as my hands pulled her head deep into me, she soon thought herself how to use her lips, tongue and even nose to bring me pleasure. I let her continue until I came for the third time on the girls face. The work has left her totally exhausted. Knowing that she wouldn’t be walking anywhere soon, I stood up and untied her feet. Without saying a word, I used the same rope to make a hangman noose, which I wrapped it around her neck. Now she began sobbing uncontrollably.”

“No wonder! You must have scared the hell out of her!”

“I did! But after all that’s the fun of it, isn’t it? So using that hangman’s noose I dragged her to my horse and placed her on top of its back. Then I just needed to pull the rope over a branch of the nearest tree so that the girl was already stretched sitting on the horse. It was a great fun to see how the young woman wanted to plead with me, to cry out to me, but her pride forced her to stay silent. A short application of the riding crop to the mares ass later and the girl’s body was pulled off the horse. Since this moment her corpse is hanging in the tree in front of the house she was pillaging. While her mouth is still filled with my sweet cum.”

“How fitting!”

“And you still haven’t heard the best of it: Inside the stables behind the house the girl kept a beautiful mare that looks just like yours. So I checked the saddle bags and found Jurij’s diary! At this moment I knew that I had just executed the girl that must have had stolen the horse from my best friend Alessia!”

“Really? Then... this girl must have been Nadja!”

“You know her?”

“Let's say, I had the doubtful pleasure to deal with her. She really is a little bitch!”

“Hm – so I am happy that I could solve this 'problem' for you!” Nastasija laughed cheerfully at Alessia - without any hint of sorrow for her dead victim.
The conversation had left Jurij really scared. Could Nastasija really kill someone just as easily as she just had told. He knew that any law would be obsolete during the civil war and the Nastasija had grown very powerful, but the idea that she might had gathered enough power to become a judge over life and death was a totally new thought for him. 

Lost in his worries he overheard the rest of their conversation. At least until Nastasija suddenly turned around and asked: "So could you already re-educate your little boy-toy into an obedient Socialist?" 

Though Jurij tried hard to show no emotion, this question caused much mortification in his poor soul. It took endless seconds until Alessia casually answered: "I'm still working on it, but I think we have made very good progress during the recent days." 

"Would you mind if I give it a thorough check?" 

A thorough check? Jurij wasn't sure what Nastasija might be meaning by this ominous phrase, but he was sure that it wouldn't mean anything good for him. Fortunately his Commandress would never hand over his fate into the cruel hands of Nastasija, would she? 
She would! Because just at the very next moment Jurij heard Alessia happy response: "Of course not! Try him out any way you want!"

But hadn't she promised to protect him from Nastasija's cruelty? 
When Nastasija reached out to grab him by his chin, he desperately cried out: "Alessia! Don't forget what you have promised me!"

His yelling left a scary silence. Alessia, Nastasija and the two guards just looked at Jurij with shocked, ice-cold expressions. Then, out of nowhere, Alessia's hand slapped Jurij hard across the face. 

"Have you lost your fucking mind to talk to me like that!?" she yelled in furious anger, that seemed to be very intended. She obviously wanted to save her reputation towards Nastasija by demonstrating a strict regime against her prisoner. 

"But...I..." he tried to calm his Commandress, but his words were lost as he winced in pain from the sting of Alessia's hand.

Nastasija started to grin by the long and unforgiving look that Alessia used to further intimidate her already totally intimidated mal'chik. 

Suddenly Nastasija's palm gently rubbed over Jurij's face where Alessia just had struck him. 

"Oh, I'm sorry! Did Alessia hurt you too much?" she mocked.

Then without warning, Nastasija's comforting palm reached out and smacked him again at the very same place. Jurij felt the urge to hit back, but then again he was too afraid of Nastasija's guards.

"Don't you think that Commander Alessia Vasilieva can decide on her own who gets in charge of her prisoners?" 

"Of course I do!" Jurij hurried to answer delicately, trying not to piss Nastasija off any further.

"I am glad that you agree. Comrade Two and Comrade Three! Would you guide this prisoner of Commander Alessia Vasilieva to my personal office rooms and prepare him for an interrogation for the ‘special cases’, please?" 

Alessia giggled: "Comrade Two and Comrade Three? Why are you calling them like that?" 

"Oh - a never can remember the real names of my guards. And beside: I also don't care for their real names!" 

"Where is Comrade One then?" 

"I had to kill him, because of his inadequate obedience. But enough about me! Let me show you your quarter for tonight - you must be still hungry from the long journey!" 

"Oh, I really am. And I could kill for a hot shower as well!" 

These were the last words that Jurij heard from his Alessia. There was no 'Good-bye' and no 'Take-care!” for him. She had just abandoned him to the mercy of Nastasija's rough looking bodyguards. Jurij's head was torn by conflicting thoughts. As Alessia was clearly breaking her promise to protect him, he as well wouldn't be bound to his loyalty-vow towards her any longer. So he formally had the right of trying to escape, yet escape seemed impossible as he was still guarded by Nastasija's guards, who were backuped by a whole unit of Red Army soldiers. 
Therefore he decided to better play along for now and wait for a better chance to escape. Alessia would surely try everything she could to hunt him down, so Jurij would also need people who could support him with food and shelter after he had escaped. He thought of his cousin Mikael, who should be hiding somewhere within this region, but he did not know where exactly he could look for him. But without Mikael's help, every plan of escape would be pure suicide.
So for now Jurij had to face whatever Nastasija would have in store for him and with a little luck he hoped to get some information about the destiny of his family out of Nastasija in the meanwhile.

Only five minutes later they came to an impressive mansion in classicist style. A silver sign at the main entrance told Jurij that this building hosted nothing less than the head of Saratovskaya's Red Army Unit.
Still the guards lead Jurij through a side entrance that was quite hidden behind some trees. Before the revolution this house must have belonged to a very rich and influential member of the Czaristic system as every little thing inside just looked exclusive. Through a labyrinth of long corridors and little stairs Jurij was lead deeper and deeper into this building.
When they must had reached the basement ground, Jurij and his guards crossed other prisoners who were lead through the corridors just like him. Then there was another prisoner. And another. It seemed that half of the town must have been taken into custody by the Red Army. The gloomy look in their eyes caused an uneasy feeling inside Jurij's stomach. This basement of endless prison cells was indeed wrapped in an oppressing atmosphere. When Jurij had lost any orientation the guards finally stopped Jurij in front of a red door and made him enter. Behind the door laid a kind of office room which was darkened by a thick, red carpet and&nbsp; velvet curtains in the same color. Every piece of furnish inside the room was made in a&nbsp; dark baroque-style. It looked like the conspiracy room of a queen. Instinctively Jurij knew that he was now inside the personal office of Nastasija. It was an indescribable way is was a very intimidating experience.
Jurij's two guards on the other hand didn't seem to have any problem of intimidation as they were pushing him onto the chair behind the heavy wooden desk in the middle of the room.
Within the next minute they reached in to the upper drawer of the desk, grabbed an old leather belt, wrapped the belt around Jurij's arms over his elbows and buckled it tightly to the chair. Then they did the same with his legs and just&nbsp; left the room, leaving Jurij alone with his worries. He knew that he now was facing Nastasija's torture and he also knew that he could withstand it. No torture could last forever, and when his soul passed he would go to heaven and meet his ancestors again. But Jurij still did not want to die. And he especially did not want to die at the hands of Nastasija and allow her to have a triumph over him in their competition for Alessia's affection.

But then again nothing happened. Instead of torture and death, Jurij faced only loneliness&nbsp; and boredom. Well, after some endless waiting the boredom started to become some kind of torture, but definitely the kind of torture Jurij had expected. It must have been hours before someone opened the room door and the silhouette of a woman appeared in the blinding-bright light that suddenly flooded through the door-frame. It was Nastasija. The leather of her polished army boots glittered dangerously in the light! Jurij was still hoping that Alessia would appear as well and protect him from Nastasija's wickedness. It was one of this hopes that ended in bitter disappointment.

“Well, I see you have already sat down and made yourself comfortable.” she mocked him with a childish grin. “Would you like a drink? Tea, or something stronger?”

“I... take a whiskey then.” Jurij answered, in hope that the alcohol of the whiskey would prepare him a little for Nastasija's sadistic games to come.
With a smile oozing charm she disappeared through a side door, that probably lead to an adjoining kitchen.

One minute later Nastasija reappeared with a tumbler a third full of whiskey. With gentle care she placed the tumbler against the lips of the still tied-up Jurij, who took a fair mouthful of the golden liquid. Nastasija grinned at his desperate thirst. She would made sure that Jurij had to earn every other sip of whiskey from now on. So she pulled up a stool opposite of Jurij's chair and took a seat.

“Now tell me, Jurij: Isn't Alessia an unbelievable hot girl?”

“Well... I guess...”

“Oh come on! We both know sexy she can be. And don't forget her incredible way to kiss!”

“I don't know if I want to talk about that right now.”

“Oh? Ups! I guess she isn't kissing you that way anymore. That's really too bad.” Nastasija mocked in faked sympathy. “But don't worry, I will take good care for her romantic and sexual needs. Right now, Alessia is peacefully sleeping in my bed and I must say, that I can hardly wait to let my tongue discover every curve of her body.”

Nastasija's cruel teasing didn't fail its purpose. Jurij's mind went crazy in jealousy. Why did Alessia gave her body to Nastasija so willingly? Why she trying to punish Jurij for his flirt with Nadja? Or was there really something in Nastasija's aura that made her so much more desirable in bed compared to him? Anyway - just the picture of HIS Alessia sleeping in Nastasija's bed was enough to drive him mad. With wide opened eyes he desperately looked at Nastasija - his successful opponent in the battle for Alessia.

But Nastasija didn't seem to care for his desperation anymore. In total calmness she asked: “So has Alessia's re-education-program for you shown any progress within the last days?”

“W...What?”

“Have you learned how to become a better citizen in a socialist society?”

As Nastasija's boots had already been perfectly positioned for a heavy kick against Jurij's defenseless legs, he
instinctively knew that this would be a question to answer with strategy instead of honesty.

“I have learned to a respect the authority of the socialist peoples commission.” Jurij declared, while he kept starring at black-marble-like shining of Nastasija's polished boots. He noticed that he was also directly looking into the reflection of his fearful face.

“Mind if I test your new respect towards the socialist people a little?”

Nastasija's boots actually seemed to be lurking for a reasonable answer to do kick out at him.

“Hmm...no...?!” he answered hesitantly, which must have been the right response as her boots still remained where they were.

“Oh – look at you. You are freaking scared of me! That's so cute!”

“I... I am not scared.” Jurij tried to state, although his voice didn't sound very confident.

His weak but stubborn resistance amused Nastasija. A playful grin rushed over her red lips when she answered: “Very well! Then let us find out how brave you really are!”

Jurij wasn't sure whether to feel relieved for passing her interview unharmed or to feel worried for the things that were about to come.

“Ah – and before I forget: You will have to remain silent from now on.” Nastasija added, while she bent down to him to kiss him on the nose, much to his shock. 

“But don't worry. I believe you will be wise enough to pass this test unharmed. And as I kind of like you, I promise that I will become a forgiving mistress to you.”

With that Nastasija stood up again and reached into the desk drawer for some set of ropes.

“Okay, first I'll take off the belt around your chest, but only so I can tie your wrists using rope instead.”

Instantly Jurij felt that this was his chance to escape!&nbsp; When he felt his body getting free from the chair he tried to flip Nastasija off him and take charge of the situation. She must have seen it coming, because she quickly turned around and kicked the heavy soles of her boots right into the groin. Jurij was too much in shock and pain to prevent Nastasija from digging her nails into the back of his head and pushing his face hard down onto the ground.

“You better understand that I'm in charge here and that it will be easier for you if you quit fighting. Besides it is useless, you will not escape if I don't want you to.” she hizzed while she slowly re-placed the belt around his neck. Jurij's shock got even increased by the firm contact of her lithe body and of restricting leather around his throat.

“There, that is better!” Nastasija cooed in Jurij's ear while he heard the leather stripe slip through the buckle of the belt.

“Now whenever you try to resist me again, I'll just have to tug a little at this belt and you will be cut off air. So better think twice next time.“ came the harsh threat from above.
As soon as Jurij stood up, Nastasija had grabbed the belt and pulled him towards the side door, using the belt around his neck like a lead. While he obediently followed her, Jurij was acutely aware of his senses, much more than normal. And terrified of what was going to happen next.
Behind the door laid a whitewashed room, empty, but well lit. Jurij's eyes swiveled around the room, drinking in the scene and only one moment later his attention was caught by a chair standing in the middle in the room. A foreign person had been tied to that chair. His whole back was bruised with the marks of a cane. In fact this person looked nearly as abused and violated as Jurij must have looked after he got his one day of 'special treatment' from Nadja. But as Jurij only could see his backside, he didn't had a clue about who this person could be. This all seemed so weird to Jurij.
Nastasija steered him to that chair, granting Jurij a closer look. Then they moved around and suddenly recognized the tied-up man. It was Mikael!!! For god's sake!
With his pale skin and bruised backside he just gave an awful sight. In total shock Jurij looked back at Nastasija. She just smirked at him as Jurij's mouth opened but no protests came out. He was well and truly in over his head. 
When Jurij finally made to say something, she stopped him by holding a finger on her lips.

“Psst! I said, be silent!” she reminded him. “Or I might have to give you the same treatment I have just given your cousin, here.” 

Jurij stood there with his legs together – tightly together – just as this gesture would protect him from the imagined and real hazards his body was just in. He was completely horrified, appalled and at the same time fascinated at this situation -&nbsp; all emotions came at once.&nbsp; And Nastasija's superior grin inside this scary room did much to emphasize his feelings that he was out of control. In fact it wasn't so much her grin that freaked Jurij out, but her look. It were her dark&nbsp; eyes that seemed to penetrate his soul. They were so dark, …so irresistible, ...nearly supernatural.
Underneath his trousers his cock became painfully hard inside the KTB-cage.

“Does it hurt?” Nastasija mocked, much to Jurij's surprise.

“Alessia has told me about your little 'issue' regarding your cock-cage and it's lost key.”

Alessia had told her already about the KTB? Jurij felt so betrayed! Why was Alessia treating his dignity in such a dismissive way? But then again, Jurij knew that he just couldn't afford to be mad at Alessia as long as he was in such delicate situation. No matter how much she would play with his feelings, he still fully depended on her favor. Because without it, he would be doomed to become another victim of Nastasija's malice.
And Nastasija was keen to ensure that Jurij would get quite a good impression of her malice during this evening. Slowly she placed herself before him and traced the tip of her crop around his caged penis. Jurij didn't dare look her in the face but hung his head. However his deep sense of shame couldn't prevent that his penis began to swell. As it filled the cage the stinging pain of the iron spikes came over him.

“So how does it feel to be locked-up without any chance of release?“ Nastasija grinned, obviously fascinated by the distress that she was just causing.

“It's... em... un... unpleasant!?” Jurij tried to find a fitting word that wouldn't satisfy Nastasija's mischievousness too much.

“You know... when I caught Nadja, I haven't only taken the horse from her?” Nastasija indicated with a knowing smile on her face.

What did she mean? Did she....? Did she really have the key to his KTB? Jurij was hoping.

“If you eagerly follow all my command through this night, I might be willing to grant you a present that you would find very releasing!”

Oh god! Nastasija has the key! Jurij thought.

“But first things first! As I have promised you already, you will&nbsp; now get your chance to prove to me that you have become a good socialist. As a good socialist you will have to love the Red Army and to hate any of it's enemies. In fact you have to hate them so much, that you are ready to fight them no matter how friendly or helpless the enemy appears to you. One of the enemies of the Red Army is this man on the chair. Until today you have known him as your cousin Mikael, but by today you will only know him as your personal E-N-E-M-Y!”

Jurij shuddered at her words, but that didn't impress Nastasija. Quickly she had selected a long whip from a rack on the wall and placed them into Jurij's hands

“I you are living under my command I will grant you the privilege to try out my favorite whip on your enemies back.”

Jurij took the whip, but didn't dare to actually whip his defeated cousin.

“I expect at least fifty heavy strokes. For every stroke that you don't deliver on Mikael, he will get two strokes out of my hand. So you won't save him any pain if you refuse to whip our common enemy. The only thing that will happen, is that your bad progress concerning your re-education pisses me off! And believe me: You definitely don't want to see me pissed off!”

Jurij took another look at Mikael. As he was firmly gagged, he couldn't say anything, but Mikael's pleading eyes were already enough to cause a feeling of sickness in Jurij's stomach.

“Don't forget who has the key to your KTB!” Nastasija warned, as Jurij still didn't showed any effort to start whipping. Then she stepped forward and let her forefinger run down his spine,&nbsp; just to his buttocks. Jurij shuddered and clenched. Nastasija did it again, while she whispered:
“I know that you don't want to hurt your own cousin because I want to remain yourself some dignity and pride. Anyway, I think your dick has a different opinion. To be pushed over your limits by a woman like me turns you on, you kinky man. You love to become my willing tool in this game! Am I right?”
He nodded his head. “Yes, Commandress Nastasija!” That was strange thing for him to confess, but the implements of torture hanging on the far wall were enough to prompt the correct response.
“So just relax and follow your cock. A little whipping won't damage Mikael more than he already is. And who knows? Afterwards your cock might even be able to enjoy my good-will!”

Slowly but surely Jurij raised his hand for his very first stroke.

Twenty minutes and thirty-nine strokes later, Nastasija stopped him: “Well done my eager socialist! But now I want you to deliver the last ten strokes directly across Mikael's face!”

“What? No way!”

“Actually I have saved Mikael' face especially for you. I think it is only appropriate to leave the destruction of his beautiful visage to a member of his own family.”

“But this is my cousin here. It's wrong! I mean: please don't misunderstand me. I am still a loyal fighter for our socialist ideals. But...”

Nastasija laughed aloud, a laugh full and hearty. "I have heard frogs croak in the muddy edge of a pond. I could not tell what they meant, but there was as much sense in their voices as in yours!”

Jurij just stood there like a block of frozen ice, so Nastasija explained him: “However – it is your choice. If you refuse to deliver the ten strokes on your cousin's face, I will get him twenty instead! And for you I guess, every chance to get out of you cock-cage again will be missed.”

The scaring prospect of staying locked-up in this cock-cage was just too much. Jurij couldn't allow that to happen! So after only a short moment of hesitation he stepped around Mikael until he stood directly in front of him. In the next moment he lifted the whip and let its end hit against Mikael's face.

“Was was that? You barely hit him at all! I've you want me to start counting at all, you will have to hit much harder!” Nastasija shouted at him.

A second hit against Mikael's face followed. Instantly Jurij looked out for Mikael's reaction. He was in a state of pure pain, but still conscious.

“HARDER!”

What? Even harder? Jurij wasn't sure how he should whip his cousin's face any harder.

“I want his face to always remember your whipping!” Nastasija clarified.

Jurij wasn't sure that Mikael would ever forgive him. In his despair, Jurij felt that he was close to tears. But after all, Jurij had been forced to whip his cousin like that, hadn't he? Jurij's hands began to tremble nevertheless.

Then he closed his eyes and whipped out with all might.

“That's it! So go on! And don't hold back! I want to see real scars on his face!” Nastasija encouraged.

But Jurij didn't even dare look Nastasija's face any more. He just closed his eyes and mindlessly let the whip lash across his cousin's face while counting to ten. After the last hit, he heard Nastasija cheer: “You have done it! So how did you like whipping the enemies of a Socialist Russia?”

Jurij had to force his eyes open, looking for the scale of his destruction. It was horrible. Mikael's face had become bruised, his eyes swollen. All his breath seemed to be taken with screaming, pleading, imploring all of which was lost as the gag had muffled Mikael's cries. Jurij felt sick.

“How did you like it?” Nastasija kept mercilessly repeating her unanswered question. Once more her dark eyes seemed to penetrate Jurij's soul, lurking for a complete confession. Not wanting to piss Nastasija off, Jurij shamefully started to admit: “Well... It's nothing I feel proud of, but I guess it was a necessary act in our fight for a better society!”

“That wasn't my question. I asked, whether you liked whipping your criminal cousin?”

“No! ...well ...of course I liked to punish a criminal, I guess. ...but...”

“Oh – shut up! Let's inspect your work instead of listening more of your crap excuses!”

When Mikael saw through his watery eyes that Nastasija was approaching him again, tears of despair were added to his tears of pain. 

For this moment though, Nastasija just strutted over to stand in front of him, her hands on her hips coldly regarded him with a callous smirk. But then she discovered Mikael's mounting fear and the pain in his eyes and she started taunting him: “Ah, poor little imperialist! Feeling the burn?” 

He just glared at her, his eyes blazing in brief anger and hatred then fresh tears of hopelessness.

“It hurts to be beaten so hard by his own family, doesn't it?” Nastasija kept mocking him. In return Mikael sobbed something into his gag, but Jurij couldn't really understand what his cousin was trying to say.

“Please, Nastasija! Don't you think that you have already relished enough misery to Mikael?” Jurij desperately plead to Nastasija, trying to save Mikael from his complete devastation at least.

This brave intervention earned him an ice-cold look from Nastasija's eyes.

“I said 'SHUT UP!'” she suddenly barked out much louder and angrier that Jurij had expected.

While Jurij was still recovering from his little show, Nastasija had already grabbed the whip and pulled it out of Jurij's hand.

“I am afraid that Alessia will really have to tighten her re-education methods on you if she wants to convert you into a useable socialist. Maybe I should help her a little over the coming days!” Nastasija hizzed at him in a most threatening voice. 
Instinctively Jurij slightly raised his hands in silent surrender. Fortunately this gesture seemed to please her anger a little. Holding the whip still in her left hand, Nastasija's her other hand grabbed the end of the belt that was tied around his throat and with a firm tug Jurij was lead lead into a dark corner of the room. Taking a long rope from an iron shelf she began winding the rope around Jurij's wrists. Then she cinched the rope through the middle, over and over until all the rope was used up. There was absolutely no give when Jurij tested the rope. The knots were way to high up his hands to even attempt to reach. To complete her tie, she ran a rope from the frame of the iron shelf and tied the other end around his ankle ropes. This would effectively kept Jurij tied to the shelf.

“And now: Say 'Ah'!” Nastasija half-whispered.

When Jurij saw the gag, he clamped his jaws shut. He struggled the best he could, but there was no slack at all.

“You asked for it.” Nastasija smiled as she pinched his nose. Eventually he opened his mouth a fraction to breathe. Within the next second the gag slipped in and was secured at the back of his head with a buckle. Then Jurij heard the snap of a padlock.

After Nastasija had inspected her work and double-checked the knots she finally spoke. “You will learn more about your fate in the morning. For now you will just have to endure night – sharing it tied-up in the same room as your cousin. And I am afraid that he still might be a little pissed about you! So behave!”

With despair in his eyes Jurij watched Nastasija's awesome ass walk towards the doorway while her mighty boots echoed over the ground. 

“Good night!” she laughed without even turning back.

Then she simply flicked off the lights and shut the door. Everything became black. Through the darkness Jurij could still hear Mikael's heavy breathing, He felt so sorry for what he had done to him. Being forced to injure his own family was really the most wicked way Nastasija could have tortured him. Still Jurij felt that, for the present at least, there was no hope of finding any protection from Alessia. He was totally at Nastasija's mercy now! Soon all kinds of thoughts were going through Jurij's head, but mostly just trying not to concentrate on the growing stiffness from his immobile arms and legs.

[ HAVING A 'GOOD NIGHT' ]
Meanwhile in a cozy room three floors above, Alessia was welcoming Nastasija with a enthusiastic kiss: ”You're back!”

“Yeah! I couldn't hold out any longer to come back here, knowing that such a sexy girl keeps waiting for me!”

And Alessia was looking sexy indeed. While Nastasija had taken care of Jurij, Alessia had relaxed herself under a Nastasija's personal shower. Then she had slipped into some more casual clothes that Nastasija had laid out for her.
Her new outfit consisted of red panties (which would sent older men's eyes darting away guiltily)&nbsp; and a silken shirt.
To Nastasija's silent delight the shirt couldn’t stretch enough to encompass the swell of Alessia's firm breasts and still cover her midriff, so Alessia's midriff was left exposed from the belly button almost right down to point where her pubic hair might start. Nastasija was determent to take advantage of this enticing beauty.

“So what do you think of Jurij?” Alessia nearly whispered into Nastasija's ear after she had given her lover another longing kiss on the earlobe.

“He is lovely, smells nice! I hope you will also let me play with him over the next days!?”

“Sure! As long as he enjoys you! My little mal'chik and I surely have very much to learn from you.”

“You're welcome!” Nastasija answered, but her mind already seemed to be distracted by the undoing of Alessia's panties. Her manicured fingernails were nearly finished with opening the first knot of the silken ribbon-belt when she got interrupted by Alessia.

“But, Nastasija?”

“Yes, my dear?”

“Do you think that I might damage Jurij's faith in me when leaving him to your hands without any explanation?”

“Hm... I guess I don't really know. But I do know that you shouldn't let his emotions take control over your actions!”

“You're right. But still...”

“Still what?”

“We still live in very troubled times. Maybe tomorrow the White Army takes over control again. Then Jurij would no longer be a prisoner of the Red Army and he wouldn't need my protecting guardianship anymore.”

“It borders on counter-revolutionary betrayal to even think about the possibility that the White Army could win this war. I never – ever – want you to speak like that! Still I see your point. Jurij is still very attractive, young man and as soon as he get's back his freedom he faces a promising future in our new society.”

“So what can I do to ensure his unconditional loyalty towards me.”

This question took Nastasija a few seconds of hard thinking before she hesitantly asked back: “You really want him to be yours for the rest of his life!?”

“Yes! Since the day I have borrowed him for one night to this bitch named Nadja Lukova I know that I miss him whenever he isn't at my steady beck and call. Therefore I also want him to find fulfillment only under my command.”

“Okay – here is a plan: Beside you the only backing Jurij still got left in this world is his family. If we cut him off from this network, he we be totally depending at your mercy. Originally I wanted to have a little fun with his brother Mikael for the next few weeks, but for you I am willing to organize Mikael's formal execution by firing squad by tomorrow.” 

Nastasija words came out quietly as a faint grin forming on her succulent lips. Alessia still didn't understand. How was Mikael's execution making Jurij's dependency towards her any stronger?
Seeing the quizzing look in Alessia's face Nastasija explained: “We will publish in every newspaper that Mikael&nbsp; Alexandrovich could finally be convicted as a criminal thanks to some very incriminatory statements from the witness Jurij Alexandrovich. This way Jurij's whole family will hate Jurij as a coward wimp who even betrays his own brother. I am quite sure that the partisans of the White Army will even set out a bounty on Jurij's head. He will have no other place of protection than in your custody!”

“And without the emotional backup of his family, Jurij will loose any rebellious spirit his spirit.” Alessia grinned back.

“I deeply hope so! In fact I am quite sure – if we do it right - Jurij will quickly loose any spirit of his own at all. Then the only purpose left for him will be to serve and cherish you.”

“You can be such a mean bitch sometimes!”

“Don't you like it?”

“Are you kidding? It makes me even hotter to be around you! But how can you initiate Mikael execution just like this? Hasn't there at least to be a trial or something?”

“Sure there has to be a trial! But fortunately I am the only young woman around a whole unit of needy soldiers. So it wasn't really hard to even entice the head of the military tribunal with my feminine charms. He is not a very attractive kind of man, but as long as I can keep him believe that he might have a chance to get me into his bed someday, he is eating out of my hand. It just takes me a little hint and Mikael's chances at the trial will be doomed.”

Alessia couldn't explain why this sudden evil streak of Nastasija turned her on so much, but she also had to admit that she was a little scared of it in this moment.

“So you really would give up your toy Mikael just for me?”

“Well, he isn't so fresh meat anymore, anyway!” Nastasija said with an indifferent sigh.”His balls even have started to rot since I cut them off from his blood circulation.”

“You are so desirably vicious! I just pray never to become on of your poor prisoners!” Alessia declared in fascinated awe.

“Don't worry! To such a beautiful prisoner like you I would be especially caring!” Nastasija just answered with a most ambiguous grin while her hand slipped underneath Alessia's silken shirt. It was the same hand that firmly pushed Alessia onto Nastasija's bed one moment later and initiated a wild night full of forbidden pleasure between the two women.

[ ALONE ]
Jurij was awakened by a dull sound and some gagged crying. It was Nastasija, kicking the heavy top of her boot into Mikael's rib-cage.

“Change of plans! Instead of letting you rot here like I have promised you and like you would deserve it, you will get the generous gift of a free trial to explain the crimes you have committed!” Nastasija explained this early waking-up to Mikael in a matter-of-fact-voice that surely allowed no argumentation. 
And as a barely conscious Mikael indeed didn't show any sign of resistance, his body was grabbed and dragged out of the room by two of Nastasija's guards. Without even taking note of Jurij, Nastasija walked back out of the room, not forgetting to carefully lock the iron door behind her. As if the tied-up Jurij would have had any chance of escape when the doors hadn't been locked!
Then Jurij was alone. In fact it was the first time that he was completely on his own since he had come back from war-imprisonment and met Alessia. And he couldn't remember a time when he ever felt so alone before. He missed Alessia. He knew that he should feel angry at her instead, but the more the loneliness of this cell overcame him, the more he longed to watch her voluminous brown hair flying through the wind again. ...and to hear again the sweetness of her voice when she called him 'her little mal'chik'. ...and to feel her fingernails again how they were playing with the sensuality of his skin.
But finally all of these thoughts and daydreams had only to end in the sad realization that Jurij was still bound on a iron frame inside a dark basement room. 
Somehow Jurij felt relieved that it was Mikael and not himself who was brought to a trial. Still he wondered, what kind of a trial Nastasija would have in store for his cousin. At least he wouldn't have to suffer such boredom as Jurij had to endure right now. Alessia wouldn't have had forsaken him, would she? Maybe she was enjoying herself with Nastasija and Mikael while Jurij was long forgotten. As the hours went by, Jurij felt the urge to scream out his frustration just to know that he was still alive. But unfortunately he was still effectively gagged.

[ THE POWER OF GIVING IN ]
It must have been already late in the afternoon when Jurij finally heard the sound of boot steps echoing from behind the door. They were followed by the sound of a key slipping into the lock of the door. The key turned around and the door opened just for a slide. Two hazel brown eyes curiously lurked into Jurij's cell. Alessia! Finally!
Still gagged Jurij could only let his eyes express how happy and relieved he felt when he saw her again.
Alessia still must have liked the picture Jurij gave her, because the pair of lips turned into a sincerely smirk
With a light kick of her right foot she casually eased the door shut.

The delight of seeing Alessia again caused him an immediate erection. All his bad moods about her recent indifference towards his fate were overpowered by the sight of her beauty.
As the erection developed, the spikes of the KTB bit themselves deeper into his tender skin and made him wince in pain.

‘Does it still hurt you, darling?’ Alessia asked, while she let her fingers stroke through his hair, making Jurij quiver at her touch. 

‘Hmm.’ Jurij only muttered thickly through his gag.

“I see!” Alessia cheered. “But fortunately I brought wonderful news for you, Jurij.”

During the endless seconds it took Alessia to release Jurij from his gag he thought about what these 'wonderful news' could be. When the gag finally plopped out of his mouth, he guessed joyfully: “You have got the key that will get me out of this mean chastity belt?”

“Oh yes! Nastasija returned them to me just yesterday!”

“Thank god! Please…take this thing off me!’ Jurij said, gesturing at the cage that enclosed his pulsing cock.

But Alessia just smiled and gently patted his head. 

“Sorry, mal'chik! But I really like you this desperately and I want to see just what happens if I deprive you for 
even longer.”

“What?”

“I said: 'I ain't gonna give up the fun to tease and denial your erotic senses a little bit longer!”

“But why are you telling me about 'good news' you have for me?” Jurij whined in powerless frustration.

“Because the news I have for you are even better!” was Alessia's short reply.

Even better? Jurij didn't understand. Alessia allowed herself to enjoy the quizzing look at Jurij's face for a few more moments, before she finally fished out a piece of paper from the inner pocket of her jacket and held it underneath Jurij's nose.

It was an official declaration signed by the Highest Soviet of Saratovskaya proclaiming that all charges held against Jurij&nbsp; Alexandrovich as obsolete. Jurij looked up at Alessia curiously, not really afraid but confused.

“Read on!” she promptly commanded him.

When Jurij followed her command he had to read that this total absolution was reasoned by his 'significant support' in the criminal charge against Mikael Alexandrovich. Without Jurij Alexandrovich's accusing statements Mikael Alexandrovich wouldn't be convicted of his capital crimes that were now to be punished by death. Death? Jurij read on. By the time Jurij had fully read the text his face had became pale.

“Mi...&nbsp; Mikael... ...is getting the death penalty?” Jurij finally re-found his words. “That's crazy! He never has done anything that bad!”

“Oh – the Trial of the Red Army thought so too unless you have accused Mikael for all these awful crimes!”

“What? But I haven't accused my dear cousin at all! Nastasija had forced me to whip him, but that's it!”

“Really? I guess Nastasija must have exaggerated your support in her yesterdays interrogation of Mikael a little.”

“A little??? We have to save Mikael! Please let me explain to the trial that my so-called 'accusations' were all lies!”

“Oh – I am afraid that it is already a little to late for that! The death penalty has been executed on Mikael just this morning!”

“No! Not Mikael! Why? Why haven't you told me?”

“I thought Nastasija would tell you.”

“She hadn't!”

“Well, you really missed something! To make the execution more interesting, Nastasija told Mikael that only one of six guarders would have a bullet in his rifle. Mikael had to pick five guarders for his execution. So if he would be lucky, he would randomly pick the five ones with no a bullet in there barrel. Nastasija's mouth curled into a cruel smirk as she saw the rapidly growing nervousness in Mikael's face when he realized that he had a chance of one to six to survive.”

“That's so cruel!”

“Wait – the best is still to come: Instead of letting the five guarders shoot at Mikael at the same time, Nastasija decided to let them shoot one by one, so that Mikael would have the chance to anticipate the fatal shoot over and over again. Just like a nice adaption of Russian Roulette!”

Jurij was disgusted by this unnecessary act of psychological torture, still his cock began to throb again underneath the trousers and tried to erect until the teeth of the KTB bit once more savagely into his flesh. Instantly Alessia had guessed what was happening as Jurij whimpered softly and smiled. She felt especially proud that her report of Nastasija's sadism was causing him so much excitement and misery. She was becoming aroused by his obvious distress herself as she smirked coldly at him and went on with her report.

“So when the first guarder pulled his trigger, Mikael winced in anxious fear. But he was lucky as no bullet shot out of the rifle. He was still trying to calm down when, Nastasija sighed in loud disappointment and began to rush for trying out the next gun. You should have seen Mikael's face at this moment! It was filled with pure terror. I have to admit that I felt my own excitement starting to leak between my thighs into my panties, when I saw Nastasija's grinning at Mikael with a look of ultimate power. Oh, how I love to witness this aura of superiority in her. She really is meant to rule over the fate of men!”

Jurij felt a little irritated by the unconcerned frankness in which Alessia indulged about Nastasija's questionable charms. Alessia however didn't seem to care very much about Jurij's worries, but went on:

“By the time the second&nbsp; guarder pulled his trigger, Mikael's leg muscles were already quivering almost uncontrollably. Once more the barrel of the rifle was empty. 'Congratulations! Just three more shoots left and you have survived this execution!' was Nastasija's only comment. And Mikael kept being lucky as there was no bullet in the third rifle as well.
'Let's see what the fourth rifle has in store for you!' Nastasija almost purred in mounting ecstasy, delighting in the Mikael's obvious fear. Much to my surprise, even the fourth rifle didn't contain the final bullet. So there was only one more rifle to shot. It was all or nothing. Freedom or death! Nastasija however kept teasing Mikael mercilessly with little jokes until he was nearly freaking out. The fifth guarder had already placed his finger on the trigger, when Nastasija suddenly took a look at her watch and shouted at the guarders to take their lunch-break as they had to stick on the&nbsp; official working rules. The execution would have to get postponed for this time. A few seconds later everyone except Mikael, Nastasija and me had left the room to take his lunch-break. Nastasija grabbed the rifle of the fifth guarder from the table and started to circle around Mikael menacingly, pressing the tip of the barrel casually into his ass and then dragging it around until it pointed at his hips. Her voice was low and measured, when she asked him if he had realized that this rifle contained the answer to his most urgent question. He quietly nodded, his face full of ice-cold fear. Nastasija continued to trace the tip of barrel down to his crotch as she walked around him. Then she made a surprising offer by asking Mikael if he would like her to shorten this execution up by letting her pull the trigger right now. Mikael glanced down as if to think about an appropriate answer, but Nastasija had quickly put the barrel of her rifle under his chin raising his head back up. Holding it there she stepped closer and coldly declared that she would take his silence as a 'Yes!'. Stepping back, she pointed the rifle's barrel directly against his forehead. One more time Nastasija licked her own lips in delicious anticipation before she ordered Mikael to make himself ready to receive the final truth. Mikael just swallowed. Finally he started to nervously whimper something but before I could understand a single word there was a loud BANG. And Mikael's body crushed down to the ground. His forehead was smashed by a bullet. He was dead.”

With that Alessia paused to watch Jurij's reaction on her words and smiled at him in supreme satisfaction when he returned her gaze with a look of horrified disgust.

“It sounds quiet ironic that your cousin died of the very last bullet before he would be free, doesn't it?”

“Yeah... It really does...”

“Well, when I told Nastasija about this irony she grinned back at me, just to tell me that there was no bullet in all of the six original weapons. When she sent the guarders to their lunch-break however, she quickly changed the fifth rifle with a loaded one that the had hidden behind a box. This way she made 100 percent sure that Mikael would be killed by the fifth rifle after a maximum amount of tension.”

“She... She tricked him?”

“Well, she hardly could return the freedom to a convicted criminal, could she?”

“But this way she broke a promise! This bitch surely have dishonored herself!” Jurij blurred out before he even realized the explosive power of his words.

Alessia glared coldly at him but didn't say a word. For a few minutes the only noise in the room was the loud clicking of her heels on the polished wooden floor as Alessia slowly walked around the still tied up Jurij. When she noticed that his body began quivering under the raising tension that her meaningful silence was causing, she declared: 

“A promise to a lousy criminal like him is surely less worth than the dirt below my boots. So you better keep your cheeky mouth kindly shut up before you call Nastasija a bitch again!”

 How she loved seeing all the anxious fears growing within Jurij and reflecting in his large terrified eyes.

“I'm sorry!” Jurij finally tried to apologize.

And indeed he managed to calm down Alessia's anger. In fact she even licked her lips in sweet triumph before she continued: “And besides: No-one cares for Mikael's fate anyway! All that counts is the fact that you are no longer a prisoner of the Red Army!”

“No-one cares for Mikael? My whole family will care! For them it will look like I am a most unscrupulous traitor who have even rat on his own cousin just to save his own skin.”

With superior indifference Alessia's cool gaze looked at him sideways over the collar of her military-jacket. 
“Well, your family might think so! Especially since you also have burnt down your family's house just to get rid of the responsibility to protect the family's estate!”

“What? You know that I haven't done that! That have been the work of the White Army.”

“Yes, I know that. But your family doesn't know! And it will be very hard to convince them of you innocence in both cases. It more looks like you have changed the sides.”

“They gonna kill me! And even if not, some partisans of the White Army surely will!”

“What a tragic loss to the world!” Alessia sighed, leaving Jurij doubtful how ironic this comment would be meant to be.

“Please! You got to save me!”

A soft intake of breath from Alessia let Jurij know that she was a little enjoying his up-rising despair.

“Have I? Hmm... why should I?”

“Please! Alessia! Don't keep he hanging here! After all I have done for you!”

“You did all you have done for me because you had no other choice!”

“So what do you want?”

Alessia loved to see Jurij whimper a little too much to release him off the hook too easily. Slightly moving her head from left to right she spoke in a doubtful voice: “Hmm... Well... I'm not sure if you are really willing to pay my price!”

“I'll do anything you ask for in return! Just name your price, for god's sake!”

She just smiled and walked to the other end of the room and sat down in a chair. She crossed her legs and a stared at him, a new expression on her face. Now I was getting concerned for while she still smiled, it was now a look of cruelty. 

“Okay – my protection will cost you nothing less but the surrender of your life. In fact I want you to accept a neurologist's diagnostics certifying that you are insane and that you therefore haven't the legal competence to incur any kind of liabilities.”

Jurij swallowed; this discussion clearly wasn't running well for him.

“I also want you to sign a formal document dated back two weeks ago in which you declare that in such a case you freely wish me to&nbsp; take over the guardianship over your life. By the power of this declaration I will become the official guardian in your behalf, not only in control over all your finances, but also over your health and over your time schedule without requiring any of your consent.
And as you won't be a Red Army's prisoner of war any longer but a medical patient in my custody, there will be no hope for release when the war is over, No matter which party will win this Civil War you will always stay under my control – just like my personal bond-servant.”

“But... what will happen if you ever get bored of me?”

“Well, honestly: I will have to find a way to get rid of you! So after you signed this document, you better take care that this will never happen! So how do you decide? Do you want to go home and wait to get killed by an ambush or do you prefer to stay under my sweet command until the day I have no more use for you.”

Alessia's latest sentence forced Jurij to gulp, feeling sick and unbearably turned on at the same time.

Xxx
By the lovely sight of how she pull a streak of hair back behind her ear, he knew that he still wanted to be with Alessia – beside all the fear that she loved to inflict inside him.

When he felt his pulsing cock pressing painfully against the hard mesh of the cock cage, he gestured down at his crotch and quietly asked: “And this thing?”

The awkwardness of his question made Alessia smile. “'This thing' will stay on of course until you have earned yourself an appropriate reward! You wouldn't expect me to relish control over your sexuality, would you?”

The obvious silliness of his question made Jurij lowered his gaze until he was just starring dumbly at her long legs.

“I guess not!” he finally admitted “...but...”

“But?”

“But maybe I can just free me just for five minutes, just for one little moment of relief!”

Alessia giggled. “And why should I do this? After all it's you who has to bear the frustration and not me!”

“Maybe my tongue can give you some relief in return?”

‘No!’ Alessia declared, closing her thighs. ‘My pussy is still&nbsp; a little tender from my yesterday's night with Nastasija. She really know who to satisfy a woman! God, she was so glorious, I came at least five times!’ 

Jurij grew instantly jealous but he knew that he couldn’t say anything the would make Alessia stop., Not finding any words to return, he kept staring longingly at that leathern straps at the top of Alessia's boots.

“Maybe I even should let Nastasija decide when to reward you with the next release. What do you think?” Alessia started teasing him.

“You're going to stay with Nastasija?”

“Why not?”

“She... she is … like pure evil. Please stay away from her. She surely is bad company for you!”

“Maybe I want to be surrounded by bad company!? Maybe I want to become 'bad company' myself!?”

These words made Jurij freeze. Alessia was surely enjoying her path onto the darker side of her character. It was this joy that scared him most.

“Please... Nastasija despises me. You can't force me to live with her!”

“Oh – I am afraid that you have not enough to bargain for any negotiation!”

“But...”

“No more 'buts'. It's time to make your decision!”

As Alessia still saw hesitation in Jurij's eyes, she leaned down to manipulate his visibly irritated senses a little more.
Her warm fingers began to cares the sides of his head. Friction melted his spine as her soft lips finally touched his dry mouth and her sweet perfume tantalized his nose. Adding these new sensations into the millions that were already swirling inside Jurij's head, her kiss turned his mind into a happy chaos
Jurij started to pull his legs up a little so he could counter-thrust into her more easily but his ties were to short, forcing his ass to fall back onto the hard ground.
Alessia used this opportunity to bend down over him and to grind her pelvis against his. By slowly raising the pressure of her&nbsp; hips, she made sure that Jurij was wishing even more desperately that his counter-thrusts would be more powerful. Still he could barely keep up with her.
His effortless struggles made her slightly smile in amusement. Slowly her grip on his head became harder, as she leaned down to kiss Jurij another time. Alessia was determined to keep him controlled in her kiss as long as she could and Jurij was only happy to oblige.
Then Alessia's lips suddenly broke off the kiss, leaving Jurij hanging with an open mouth and closed eyes. It took several moments until Jurij had fully realized the absence of her lips from his mouth and began to blink unsteadily at Alessia. Smiling down at him she whispered “So make your final decision!”
Her words were underlined by a patting of his cheek, which was surprisingly affectionately rather than aggressively. Still Jurij felt so squeezed under the weight of her warm soft body that his mind refused to work clearly. He knew that he better shouldn't make such a fatal decision under these irritating circumstances.
Unfortunately his silence made Alessia only keener to press a statement of surrender out of him. Dragging her nails over his shoulders she rose up her body until her nails could squeeze themselves into Jurij's chest. Slowly she stared to ride him. ...and to ride him harder and harder, pushing him further into lust-driven insanity. 
And then she suddenly stopped.

This time Jurij's body didn't care any longer for any rationalism of the mind. All it wanted was to melt in Alessia's warm embrace. To dissolve into her. To surrender to her fully.
And so Jurij couldn't help to hear the following words coming over his own lips: “Please! I'll sign whatever you want me to sign for you, Alessia. But... please...Let me feel you one more time.”
It were the words of the last free decision that Jurij ever made!
