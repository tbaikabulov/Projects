Synopsis: An unsuspecting male is kidnapped, tortured by a sadistic Mistress, and then sold into slavery.Executive Flesh 
By Ember Wolfdreams 
Act I 
Evening fell cool and crisp. Although Christmas had already come and gone,
  there was only a light dusting of snow on the ground and there was no hint
  of the bitter chill that should be in the air this time of year. A full moon
  hung high in the sky, illuminating the street with unnaturally bright silver
  light. 
As Steven leaves his office it seems like any other Friday night. He locks
  his door, heads to the elevator, pulls his coat and gloves on as he walks.
  He waves at the reception desk and flirts with the new lady security guard
  on his way out the door. As he turns the corner towards the parking lot he's
  thinking about what he's going to have for dinner, which club he'll go to tonight,
  which friends he'll go with, what sort of girl he'll hook up with while he's
  there, how phenomenal the sex will be later on. He has no idea that life as
  he knows it is about to end. 
~~~~~~~~~ 
The van creeps slowly around the side of the building, coming from the opposite
  direction to avoid being seen by anyone still leaving the office. It's a big
  greyish thing, battered and old. There are no windows beyond the cab except
  for those required to see behind the vehicle while driving. Inside, there is
  the blue-gray haze and acrid smell of cigarette smoke. The men inside tell
  jokes and snicker at their mark. Even if they hadn't done all of the research
  that the Lady asked, they'd still know he wasn't local. He was from down south
  somewhere. Texas. Arkansas. Louisiana. Wherever. It didn't matter. Everything
  south of Colorado was inbreeder land to them. It was pathetic the way he danced
  from foot to foot at the street crossing, puffing and rubbing his hands together. 
&quot;You'd think it was fuckin' forty below!&quot; one of them laughed as
  he lit another cigarette. 
The boys had  done their homework, though. They had been working
  on this project for months. The Lady was very specific in her tastes and would
  not be happy if they screwed this up for her. They knew that he only spent
  a couple of weeks in town every few months for business, so the grab had to
  be tonight. They knew that he had announced a much-needed vacation only days
  before. They also knew that he was single and that he had no other close family,
  him being an only child and his parents tragically passing away only months
  apart several years ago. They knew that nobody would be looking for him if
  he disappeared because he had left instructions not to contact him while he
  was away. And, most importantly, they knew that he was exactly what the Lady
  wanted, the wet dream she had described in complete detail when she had called
  on them. 
All chatter in the van stops now as the men turn into the far end of the parking
  lot. Cigarettes are hastily extinguished and the radio is silenced. There is
  the soft sound of seatbelts being unfastened, doors being unlocked, and equipment
  being readied. The van is slowly closing the gap between them and the mark.
  They're waiting for just the right moment to act, that precious few seconds
  when the mark becomes vulnerable. And then, there it is, like magic. That fatal
  moment of juggling briefcase, car keys and ringing cel phone. An instant of
  fumbling and it is all done. 
~~~~~~~ 
There is the loud screeching of tires on concrete as Steven tries to answer
  his phone. He looks up and sees the headlights of the van racing towards him,
  bearing down like some medieval monster. An instant later it's sliding to a
  halt beside him and the door is slamming open. Men are jumping out, racing
  towards him. There is the impression of black clothing, ski masks, and weapons
  in hand. He drops the keys, the phone, his papers. He tries to run, but they're
  already grabbing hold of his coat and dragging him back towards the van. He
  tries to fight, feels his fist connect solidly with flesh, and then all goes
  black. 
~~~~~~~ 
The loud slam of the van door being pulled shut heralds the return of consciousness.
  There is a loud ringing in Steven's ears and the side of his head is throbbing
  with pain. He carefully tries to move, to find out how badly he's hurt, and
  realizes that his arms have been pulled up over his head and somehow bound
  there. 
As he looks up he sees the shadowy form of one of the kidnappers standing
  in front of him gesturing at his face. He realizes after a moment that there
  is a ball of rags in the man's hand. The kidnapper is saying something then
  and holding the rags out towards Steven's face, but Steven still can't hear
  over the ringing in his own head. He opens his mouth to speak, to tell them
  that he doesn't understand, but the kidnapper quickly shoves the rags into
  his mouth before he can make a sound. The kidnapper then steps away for a moment
  only to return with a roll of duct tape. Steven's eyes widen in fear as the
  kidnapper pulls the tape over his mouth and wraps it tightly around his face
  and the back of his head. 
As the kidnapper steps away again Steven sighs with relief, somehow hoping
  that the worst is over. The dry fabric packing his mouth and the tape pulling
  at his skin and hair is uncomfortable, but bearable. He'll make it through
  this, he's sure of it. He has to believe that. 
A shadow falls over Steven's face and he looks up to see another of the kidnappers
  (or perhaps the same one... he's unsure in the dark interior of the van) standing
  over him. This time the kidnapper is holding a long strip of black cloth. This
  is quickly placed over his eyes and tied tightly, leaving him in total blackness,
  followed by something else. A softness pressing against each of his ears. 
As music begins to flood into his thoughts, Steven finds himself thinking
  that maybe he won't be alright after all... 
Act II 
It seems forever before Steven feels the inevitable rumble of the engine starting
  and the sensation of moving forward. He takes a deep breath and fights to concentrate
  over the blaring heavy metal and the fear. He has to remember where they go,
  to feel the turns and try to figure out where they are. And where they're going.
  He needs to escape. 
But time passes slowly. Each moment is an eternity, and the songs seem to
  go on for days. For a moment he is thankful for the blindfold, thankful that
  the kidnappers can't see the fear and frustration in his eyes as he comes to
  the sudden realization that he is hopelessly lost in a maze of invisible streets.
  There have been too many twists and turns; the van has covered too much distance.
  There is no way he could find his way back now. 
~~~~~~~~~~ 
The kidnappers follow the Lady's instructions to the letter, driving aimlessly
  for hours with the radio cranked up loud. They detour down crowded streets
  so they can gawk at the girls in their weekend club clothes, through dark back
  alleys where only the rats notice their passing, and over deserted dirt roads
  with the silver moon shining bright overhead. They hit the interstate just
  so they can push the old van up to 90 and scream out the open front windows
  before taking the twisting mousetrap exit to get off. They find deserted parking
  lots to wind their way through and residential neighborhoods so quiet they
  have to turn the music off completely to avoid notice. It didn't matter where
  they went, just so long as they kept moving. 
They took turns checking on the mark, occasionally turning the tape in the
  Walkman over or adjusting the headphones on his ears. The green lights on the
  van's radio clearly read 1 AM. Only another hour or so to kill before they
  were to deliver him to the Lady. 
~~~~~~~~~~ 
The van begins to slow and there is the distant vibration of the van door
  sliding open and the kidnappers getting out. Steven tenses. He isn't sure whether
  he is more glad that the ride might be over or terrified of what could happen
  to him next. He feels his arms being lowered from over his head and winces
  at the stinging pins and needles sensation as his circulation returns to normal.
  A moment later, strong hands have hold of his shoulders, dragging him to his
  feet, forcing him out of the van. Finally, the headphones are roughly jerked
  from his ears, and Steven finds the silence to be far more deafening and ominous
  than the music had been at it's worst. 
There is the soft sound of gravel crunching under his feet as he is forced
  forward. The kidnappers do not speak, and this silence also serves to make
  Steven's pulse race. Suddenly, they are stopping and there is the sound of
  a heavy metal door being opened. Then he is forced forward again. There is
  a faint echo of their feet on the floor. Tile, maybe? Or concrete? What sort
  of hell had they brought him to? 
~~~~~~~~~~ 
The kidnappers stood silently in the hall, waiting for the Lady's men to arrive.
  They glanced sidelong at their mark, almost shivering in his bonds, and marveled
  that he had retained so much self control. Most that they had brought here
  had long since broken down, sobbing behind the blindfold, begging to be released
  before the gag was securely in place, offering money or power or anything else
  they would ask if only they could be set free again. But this one was different.
  He had chosen not to cower or flee but to fight back. It was almost a shame
  to turn him over to the Lady. 
Almost. 
~~~~~~~~~~ 
Steven stands in the cold silence, his heart thundering in his ears, and wonders
  why his kidnappers are just waiting here like this. Shouldn't they be taking
  him somewhere? Or doing something to him? What the hell was going on here?
  Then, faintly, he can hear the sound of distant footfalls coming closer. He
  hears the kidnappers shifting their feet around him. 
It seems as if an eternity before the newcomers arrive, but to Steven even
  that is far too soon. There is the soft rustle of paper being handed over and
  then new hands firmly take hold of Steven's coat and shoulders. A voice hisses
  in his ear &quot;Don't even think of fighting us, boy, cuz you're gonna lose.&quot; Then
  he is forced forward again. Behind him he can hear the kidnappers walking away,
  and a moment later, the door slamming shut behind them. It echoes and in the
  hall like a warning of imminent doom. 
~~~~~~~~~~ 
As Steven walks with his new captors he becomes aware of the floor gently
  sloping downward and of the air becoming slightly cool and damp smelling. His
  mind races as he tries to determine where he may have been taken, but to no
  avail. This place doesn't fit any of the places he conjures up in memory, and
  the hours spent in the van had done their job well. It could be two blocks
  or two hundred miles from his office. 
After a time the floor begins to level out and Steven is forced around a sharp
  corner. There is the sound of a door being closed behind them and a soft breeze
  of warm air from an overhead vent. There is only a moment to ponder his new
  surroundings before Steven's new captors go to work. His hands are held out
  in front of him and there is the sound of tape being sliced through with a
  knife. Then his coat is roughly removed and his arms pulled out away from his
  sides. With the soft click of a metal padlock his wrists are secured in what
  feels like heavy shackles and held there. Next, his ankles are pushed apart
  and something is locked between them, preventing him from closing his legs.
  A moment later all activity has ceased. There is the sound of the door again,
  and then silence. 
As Steven waits in the darkness and is finally able to ponder what has become
  of him, he has a disturbing thought that chills him to the bone, causing him
  to shiver even in the warm room. These people - the kidnappers and these new
  captors - seem to know exactly what they're doing. How to grab him off the
  street, silence and bind him in the van, drive him about until he is completely
  lost, and then transfer him to another location and set of captors. They have
  obviously done this before. And since he had never seen anything about a kidnapping
  ring or disappearing persons on the news, they were obviously very good at
  what they did. 
Act III 
Steven stands in the silent room for what feels like an eternity. It could
  be minutes or it could be hours. He has by now lost all sense of time. 
He holds his breath and strains his ears in hopes of hearing.... something.
  After the long march down he feels as if he's been locked away in a tomb. But
  there is nothing. Not the echo of distant footsteps or the sound of voices
  in the hallways. Just the sound of his breathing over the gag and the pounding
  of his heart in his ears. 
And then.... something changed. Steven slowly realized that he was not alone
  in the room. He wasn't sure how, but he knew that he was being watched. He
  could feel eyes on him almost like a physical touch. He imagined that if he
  just listened closely enough, if he could just calm his beating heart, he could
  hear another person's breathing. 
~~~~~~~~~~ 
The Lady sat quietly in the large dungeon watching her new toy, waiting. And
  then, there it was. The signal she had been waiting for. The quickened breathing.
  The increased tension in his posture. All signs that he finally knew that he
  wasn't alone after all. Now it was time to begin. 
She carefully got to her feat, hearing the soft jingle of handcuffs at her
  belt, and slowly began crossing the room. She loved the way the boy's head
  jerked at the sound of metal chiming against metal. The way he turned his face
  this way and that trying to locate her by sound was simply delicious. 
She smiled as she got closer. This boy was exactly what she had ordered. He
  was tall with dark hair and fine, almost feminine features. He had a naturally
  pale complexion accentuated by long hours under fluorescent office lights.
  He was probably as much a slave to that job as he would soon become to his
  new owner on Nakrad. Only his new owners would extract what they wanted of
  him using much more effective tools than money or profit sharing or vacation
  time. 
~~~~~~~~~~ 
Steven's breathing quickened. He could hear the soft sound of them moving
  closer ... whoever they were. His heart was thundering in his ears and threatening
  to hammer it's way out of his chest. They were circling him, eyeing him from
  every angle like a predatory animal. And although he could not flee, he instinctively
  knew that they were stalking him. And then, suddenly, they were there, standing
  right in front of him. He could feel warm breath on his face, the warmth of
  another body, and those eyes measuring and appraising him. 
There was a soft tapping on the floor, the sound of something being dropped
  and then cool air against his skin. Then a second tapping, and more air to
  tease his flesh. And he realized the sound was that of buttons falling to the
  floor as they were cut from his shirt. Once again, time stretched and distorted
  in Steven's mind, and he was lost in the sound of buttons dropping to the floor
  as more and more of his skin was exposed until only the very top button was
  left. 
A moment later, Steven felt hands tugging at his shirt, pulling it out of
  his waste-band and pushing it open to expose his naked chest. He shivered as
  hands lightly traced over his naked skin, teasing with long nails. &quot;Not
  bad boy. You stay in pretty good shape for an office rat.&quot; A female voice
  said from the darkness. Then the fingers, which had been seductively teasing
  his flesh a moment before, seized his nipples, pinching, pulling, twisting
  until Steven was whimpering behind the gag. And then, just as quickly as it
  began, it was over. 
Long seconds passed as Steven sucked breath through his nose. He longed to
  pull his arms in close to his body, to curl into a ball and protect his throbbing
  chest. &quot;Awww. Poor baby. So weak.&quot; the voice came again. &quot;Let's
  see what else you've got for me to play with...&quot; Then her hands were tugging
  at his belt, unfastening it with quickness that bespoke long practice. Then
  she was opening his pants and easing them down over his hips, dropping them
  in an awkward heap around his spread ankles. 
Steven tenses as he hears her start circling him again, inspecting his body
  from every angle. He can't escape the feeling that he is being weighed and
  judged. What would happen if she somehow found him wanting? And what if he
  passed her inspection? Which fate would be worse? 
And then her hands are on him again, rubbing and squeezing his ass, sliding
  around his waist and up over his naked chest again then down toward his spread
  thighs and vulnerable cock, feeling him becoming erect under the thin fabric
  of his underwear. &quot;You like that, boy? Not for long....&quot; Then her
  hands slide down, roughly gripping his balls, pulling downward and squeezing
  until another pained whimper finds it's way from behind the gag. 
And then she is gone again, leaving Steven trembling and alone. He feels his
  knees shaking and for the first time feels grateful for the cuffs holding his
  arms aloft. Without them, he would no doubt be a crumpled mess on the floor. 
~~~~~~~~~~ 
The Lady stood back now, watching the boy's shivering body with a small smile
  tugging at her lips. There was a lovely sheen of sweat forming on his skin
  now. He was far more sensitive than she had imagined he would be. And much
  more afraid. It would be a pleasure indeed to break him to her will. &quot;Move
  him to the chair.&quot; she instructed the men standing guard at either side
  of the door. 
Leaving them to their task, the Lady then moved off to the side of the room,
  carefully examining trays of clamps and weights, spreader bars and floggers,
  gags and plugs until she had formed a plan in her mind. She then selected the
  toys that she would need. 
As she turned back to the room, she found that the men had already stripped
  her new pet of his pants and ruined shirt and were well on their way to forcing
  him across the room and into a waiting chair. 
These men had been carefully selected for their employment records, experience
  and discretion. They would do her bidding and they would not talk about what
  went on here once they left. Large sums of money and the knowledge of what
  would happen if they ever did ensured that. 
As the Lady returned to her work, she paused for a moment to pick up the boy's
  discarded tie from the dungeon floor. She had other uses for such pretty lengths
  of silk. She then watches closely as the boy is secured in the chair, his wrists
  handcuffed behind his back, his legs and thighs pushed apart and securely tied
  to the legs and seat of the chair using strong leather straps, and a final
  band of leather pulled across his upper chest. He was now completely helpless
  and at her disposal. Only one final touch remained. 
~~~~~~~~~~ 
Steven strained against his bonds, trying to force his spread knees back together,
  to pull his ankles away from the chair, to free his manacled wrists, but to
  no avail. The chair was sturdy and in good repair as were the leather bands
  holding him in place. He felt so helpless and exposed there in only his underwear,
  his knees forced wide apart over the sides of the chair. And then she was there,
  sliding her hands over his shoulders and down his chest from behind. Teasing
  his nipples with long fingernails, her hair falling down to brush against his
  cheek. &quot;Don't worry pet,&quot; she whispered into his ear, &quot;I won't
  hurt you too much.... This time.&quot; Then she stood and Steven felt the soft
  brush of silk over his nose and cheeks. It was suddenly warm and difficult
  to breathe. He felt something pulling tight about his neck and he fought to
  swallow. He shook his head, trying desperately to free himself from this new
  torture. Little did he know this was only just the beginning. 
Act IV 
The Lady stepped back away from the boy, admiring her handiwork. He looked
  so helpless there, securely bound to the chair, the hood drawn tight at his
  throat. &quot;It must be getting unbearably hot in there...&quot; she said
  as she began to circle her pet again, inspecting his body. &quot;And hard to
  breathe too. I bet you'd give me just about anything for me to take it off...&quot; The
  boy whimpers from behind the gag, his head lowering for a moment in defeat,
  and her lips are slowly curling upwards into another smile at this small sign
  of submission. 
~~~~~~~~~~ 
Sweat is beading on Steven's brow and slowly trickling down his face under
  the dark hood. His heart is pounding, his blood rushing through his ears, and
  he can feel his pulse pushing against the tight cord at his throat. He can
  hear the Lady, his tormentor, circling him, appraising him with her eyes and
  taunting him with her words. She is telling him how she will break him with
  pain, hang him and whip his flesh until he is screaming, bend him over and
  rape him with her fingers ... a strap-on ... whatever she has close by, how
  she will use him for her own pleasure, how she will give him pleasure but deny
  him release, how he will cum when she wants and be denied when it amuses her.
  And then she's there again, her warm breath on his shoulder as she whispers
  in his ear, &quot;Are you afraid yet, boy?&quot; 
Then she is gone again and there is the rattling of metal as if from across
  the room. There is no way to be sure, though, under the hood. 
~~~~~~~~~~ 
She returns to the side of the room, carefully selecting a tray of toys to
  use on the boy's virgin flesh. The Lady smiles, taking her time, imagining
  all of the fiendish tortures she could inflict on her new play-toy. 
~~~~~~~~~~ 
Steven hears the soft clinking of metal on metal as his tormentor returns.
  He tenses, afraid of what she might do to him next. There is a long moment
  as he waits, imagining the worst, praying that she'll change her mind and set
  him free. 
And then there are the hands caressing his skin again, almost lovingly, teasing
  his nipples to hardness. He feels his cock responding to her, growing hard
  between his legs as the hands are followed by her soft, wet mouth on his flesh.
  He moans into the gag as her tongue slowly moves over first one nipple, then
  the other. His head falls back, tightening the cord about his throat, but he
  doesn't care anymore. He knows this must be some trick, that he should be afraid
  of her, but gods he doesn't care anymore. It feels sooo good.... Her mouth
  is moving downward over his chest ... his belly ... her face nuzzling between
  his thighs. 
But a moment later Steven is screaming into the gag, his right nipple an explosion
  of pain. He tries to lean forward, to curl in on himself once more, but is
  held fast by his bonds. Tears fill his eyes and seep into the blindfold beneath
  the hood. He is gasping for air; the hood and gag making him feel as though
  he is being suffocated. And then, just as his breathing begins to return to
  normal, he is screaming in agony again as a second clamp is added. Steven's
  head falls forward now and he is sobbing beneath the hood. Were it not for
  the gag, he would be begging this demon to release him, he would promise her
  anything if only the pain would stop. 
~~~~~~~~~~ 
She pauses a moment, watching the boy's body shudder and convulse against
  his bonds as he tries to escape, tries to lean forward and protect his tortured
  chest. She knows he's begging her to remove those clamps. He's screaming into
  that gag and promising anything if she would just stop. But she knows that
  the pain of removing the clamps will be just as great. Slowly, she reaches
  out to touch him, tracing her fingers over his chest, around his tortured nipples,
  her painted nails brushing over the clamps to send yet another wave of pain
  through his body. He shivered so beautifully from the pain. 
The Lady's smiling to herself again as she returns to her tray of torture
  toys, lifting a cool silver chain from it's surface. Looping it loosely in
  her hand she reaches out, letting the cold metal brush against the insides
  of his spread thighs and slowly drags it upwards over his belly. She pauses
  a moment, moving the cold chain over his nipples. &quot;What do you suppose
  I'm going to do with this, boy?&quot; she asks, watching as he shudders in
  anticipation and fear. 
Another long moment passes as she continues to brush his skin with the loose
  chain, pausing to loop it around his throat, pulling it tight and then slowly
  pulling it off again like a snake slithering over his flesh. Then, she grasps
  hold of first one clamp and then the other, attaching the chain, holding it
  her my hands for a moment before letting it fall to his chest. 
~~~~~~~~~~ 
Steven's back arches and he desperately sucks air through his nose at the
  tug of the chain being dropped from the Lady's hand. Then he feels her finger
  tracing down the center of his chest, snaking under the chain, slowly pulling
  at the clamps. He whimpers softly as he feels her tug at first at one nipple
  and then the other, lightly at first and then with increasing force until he
  is bucking in the chair, begging her to stop from the other side of his gag.
  When she finally paused, letting the chain fall from her hand again, Steven
  felt himself almost sobbing in relief. 
&quot;Don't get comfortable yet, boy,&quot; he heard her whispering into his
  ear. &quot;I'm not done with you yet.&quot; 
He heard another soft rattle and then felt her taking hold of the chain again,
  pulling on it slightly for a moment and then letting it fall back to his chest,
  but this time it was much heavier. He groaned, feeling the clamps tighten and
  bite into his tender flesh. 
&quot;Trying to be tough now, are we?&quot; she teased. &quot;We'll se about
  that.&quot; And the chain was lifted again, and dropped, only much, much heavier.
  And Steven found himself gasping for air again. 
&quot;You want more, boy?&quot; She asked, taking hold of the chain again,
  pulling back on it until Steven was sure she was going to tear it from his
  chest. And he was sobbing into the gag again, tears seeping under the blindfold
  and sliding down his cheeks. He shook his head no, hoping and praying that
  she would stop. 
Act V 
The Lady stood up, stepping back from the boy. She found herself smiling again,
  listening to him sobbing behind the hood and gag. She could only imagine how
  it felt to be in there. Blind, nearly deaf, totally helpless. And between the
  gag and the cord at his throat and the stifling heat, he must feel suffocated
  ... strangled. It was almost enough to make her want to rip the gag from his
  mouth so she could hear him beg. 
Taking a deep breath, she crossed back to the far side of the room. Pausing
  for a moment, she takes a bottle of water from a small refrigerator on the
  floor. As she drinks deeply she begins surveying her toys again, and begins
  to decide what she will do with this poor, helpless boy next. 
She slowly run her hands over an array of strap-ons, vibrators, and dildos
  of all shapes and sizes, a smile playing across her lips at the thought of
  using them on him. Then she moves on to assorted paddles, floggers, and whips.
  But she is still unsatisfied. She needed something to push him over the edge,
  to leave him in a defeated heap, before she will end this day. And then she
  sees it, the answer to her dilemma. 
~~~~~~~~~~ 
Steven sits, fighting back tears and the throbbing pain in his chest. The
  weights drag mercilessly at his nipples and the clamps dig deeply into his
  flesh. He is sure that when he can finally see again he will see them permanently
  damaged, mutilated by this sadistic bitch. He can hear her, faintly, on the
  far side of the room. He wonders what she's doing, what she's thinking of,
  what she'll do to him next. 
And, then he tenses, hearing her boots on the floor as she returns. 
&quot;Would you like a drink, boy? I know it must be hot in there...&quot; she
  says into his ear. Then he can feel the wetness of her mouth at his neck, licking
  near the opening of his hood. Steven finds himself moaning behind the gag despite
  himself ... after so much pain, the pleasure is more intense than he could
  have imagined. 
A moment later he finds himself arching in the chair, the shock of cold water
  running down his chest, over his tortured nipples, soaking his underwear. And
  then that mouth on his skin, licking the water from his chest, probing around
  his clamped nipples, moving downward over his belly then lower, licking and
  nuzzling his thighs, moving higher to rub her face between his legs, teasing
  him with her teeth. 
And then she is gone, and there is no time to contemplate as his legs and
  thighs erupt in pain. He tries to flinch away, to close his legs, but to no
  avail. The leather holds him firmly in place, at her mercy. 
But just as quickly as the pain began, it's over and he can feel her cool
  hands lightly rubbing his thighs, her mouth softly kissing and licking his
  burning skin. 
~~~~~~~~~~ 
The boy whimpers beautifully beneath the hood and the Lady finds herself smiling
  once more. It was such a sweet, plaintive sound to her ears. A plea to be released,
  to be set free, to cum. Such a sweet sound it almost made her want to give
  in to it. To remove the clamps, untie him, soothe his hurts. 
Almost. 
Slowly, she slid her hands up along the insides of his thighs, slipping her
  fingertips under the thin cotton of the boy's underwear to tease his cock and
  balls. And her smile grew as she felt him growing hard again under her touch
  despite the pain. But this time she waited a bit longer, stroking his cock
  with her fingers, her mouth softly licking his thighs, until she felt him trying
  to thrust back against her. It was then that she stood again, taking the red
  leather whip from her belt, and beginning to methodically strike the insides
  of his thighs, watching his body arch in the chair ... only this time in pain.... 
~~~~~~~~~~ 
Steven sobbed into his gag when the pain stopped again. He didn't know how
  much more of this treatment he could take. The constant pain and fear was one
  thing, but this trading back and forth of pleasure and pain, bringing him close
  to the point of orgasm each time only to have it end in agony was more than
  he could bear. All he could do was hope that she would soon tire of this game
  and move on to something else even though he knew that 'something else' would
  no doubt be much worse. 
~~~~~~~~~~ 
She paused, watching the boy in his chair. She can hear him sobbing behind
  the gag again and knows that he can take little more of this treatment. After
  a moment of contemplation, the Lady decides that this will be her final, and
  most torturous, act. Then she could rest and decide what to do with this new
  boy tomorrow. And so, from her pocket, she produces a small pocketknife and
  leans down to tug lightly at the boy's underwear as she carefully slices the
  material away from his body, leaving him completely exposed. A smile plays
  across her lips again as she sees his body is already responding to her touch,
  anticipating the pleasure that it can bring. 
~~~~~~~~~~ 
Steven whimpers softly into the gag, feeling the cooler air of the room against
  his exposed cock and balls. He fights the arousal he feels in his body, but
  to no avail as he feels her mouth once again caressing the skin of his thighs,
  moving slowly higher. And although he fears her, hates her, wants nothing more
  than to be free of this demon woman, he also wants her in a way he'd never
  wanted any woman in his whole life. 
~~~~~~~~~~ 
She softly rubs her face against the boy's cock and nuzzles his balls with
  her nose, slowly taking in the scent of him. A moment later her tongue is lightly
  flicking along the underside of his cock, moving upwards toward the tip, and
  she can hear him moan within the hood. And then she's slowly circling the head
  of his cock with her tongue, swirling in slow circles as she takes him into
  her mouth, feeling him buck against her face. 
It only takes a moment to find his rhythm and then he's sliding easily in
  and out of her mouth while her hands deftly massage his balls, driving him
  closer and closer to orgasm. And then, as she feels his body arching in the
  chair and his cock beginning to vibrate in her mouth, she reaches up, her hand
  locking on the chain suspended between his nipples, pulling hard. And although
  she can hear him screaming into the gag, he is well beyond the point of no
  return.... 
~~~~~~~~~~ 
Steven feels his whole body shuddering as he cums. He doesn't even feel the
  pain anymore, all of his senses have blurred and he is lost. Time stretches,
  and moments feel like years. And then, over the rushing in his ears, he hears
  the woman's distant voice saying &quot;Take him to a cell. I'll deal with him
  some more in the morning...&quot; A moment later, there is the sound of the
  door closing behind her. 
Act VI 
Steven feels the leather straps quickly undone and then strong arms lift him
  from the chair. He tries to walk with them, to obey their silent command to
  move to another room, but he is completely unable. His legs shake beneath him
  and he is half dragged from the torture room and out into the hallway. The
  feel of the cooler air is a shock to his whole body and he whimpers beneath
  the hood. He feels his skin erupting in gooseflesh and within a few moments
  he is shivering. 
Finally they pause and there is the soft jingle of keys and then the heavy
  metallic sound of a lock being opened. He is dragged through the doorway and
  dropped heavily onto a narrow bed. His arms are quickly pulled over his head
  and cuffed there, a blanket is thrown over his cold body, and then there is
  the thud of the door being closed and locked behind them. 
~~~~~~~~~~ 
The Lady leaves the dungeon and heads down the long concrete hallway. Near
  the end she turns and presses the button next to the elevator. As she stands
  listening to the soft hum of the machinery beyond the heavy double doors she
  finds herself thinking of the new boy. He was everything she had asked for.
  Tall. Fair. Muscular without being bulky. And ever so sensitive. He had been
  a joy to play with tonight. 
There was a soft bell announcing the arrival of the elevator and she was distracted
  for a moment as she stepped through the open doors. Two of her guards were
  inside. She imagined they were either going home for the night or headed outside
  to check the grounds. She didn't really care either way. Managing them wasn't
  really her concern anyhow. 
On the ride upstairs her mind wandered back to the boy. Abducting a slave
  from Earth was risky business. The Terrans had funny views of slavery, believing
  that all of their kind deserved the right to manage their own destiny even
  if that destiny was war, famine, starvation, disease, or any one of countless
  other dismal fates. At least slaves had homes and were cared for. And at least
  on her home world of Nakrad there were few incidents of violent crime committed.
  The outrages of rape, incest, and child abuse had been eradicated among her
  culture a millennia ago. She didn't believe that Akasha had it too far wrong
  in &quot;Queen of the Damned&quot; when she surmised that eliminating males
  would eliminate much if not all pain and suffering in a given world. The only
  difference between her plans and theirs were that they simply enslaved males
  rather than killing them outright. 
The elevator stopped at last on the top floor. She punched in the pass code
  that would allow the doors to open and stepped out into her private quarters.
  It was a large penthouse apartment with spacious living room, lovely foyer,
  three full bedrooms in addition to the large master bedroom, four bathrooms,
  a complete kitchen, a well stocked library, her office, and a beautiful balcony
  that had been decorated with potted plants and expensive patio furniture. It
  was all quite lovely and expensive. She had worked for months with a decorator
  to make everything just as she pleased. If she had to spend time on Earth she
  might as well be comfortable. 
The Lady walked through the ivory tiled foyer and headed for her bedroom.
  Inside she collapsed on the deep blue velvet covers. She suddenly felt exhausted.
  A session like that always left her feeling completely drained, and for a moment
  she regretted the fate of this slave. She would have liked to keep him rather
  than ship him off to the auction houses back home. 
She groggily pulled off her boots, throwing them across the floor, then slid
  the soft leather of her pants down over her hips and kicked them off as well.
  She tugged the cotton T-shirt up over her head along with her bra and deposited
  them with the rest of her clothing. Finally she moved to the head of the bed,
  wrapping her arms around one of the soft feather pillows and heaving a deep
  sigh before falling asleep. 
~~~~~~~~~~ 
Steven lay in bed trying desperately to fall asleep. The hood was hot and
  unbearably humid. He had dozed off several times but always woke frightened
  and choking as the cord in the hood dug into his throat through the heavy silk.
  He had tried to turn over but to no avail as the metal holding his wrists over
  his head dug into his skin. The blanket, which had been so warm and comforting
  at first, had become too hot to bear as well, and in his attempts to kick it
  onto the floor it had become entangled around his legs. His body hurt, too.
  His nipples throbbed with each beat of his heart and the insides of his thighs
  burned where she had struck him. He whimpered softly in despair. 
~~~~~~~~~~ 
The next morning dawned gray and cold. It wasn't that the Lady hadn't seen
  snow before. It was just that she hated it. She hated the wet snow and the
  slippery ice. She hated the endless despair the colorless sky seemed to force
  into her very soul. She didn't understand how anyone could actually enjoy this
  season. 
She crawled unwillingly out of her warm bed, slipped into a soft, velvet robe
  and walked to the kitchen. Blessedly someone had thought to make coffee this
  morning. She didn't really like the bitter dark liquid, but had discovered
  that with the right amount of cream and sugary flavored syrup it could be made
  bearable. 
She touched a button on the intercom and instructed the guards to bring the
  new slave to her quarters around 10. That would give her time to take a proper
  bath and dress. 
~~~~~~~~~~ 
Steven felt as though he had only been asleep for a moment when the guards
  entered his room and pulled him up out of the bed. He felt dizzy and weak and
  hoped it was more from his sleepless night and not from anything that bitch
  had done to him. 
He was forced into a tiled stall that he guessed was a shower and his body
  was roughly hosed down with icy water. Then he was drug back into the room
  and dried just as roughly. A moment later he was forced into the hall with
  the guards. It seemed they walked forever before he was allowed to stop on
  a lightly carpeted surface. Then there was the familiar queasy feeling of an
  elevator rising beneath his feet. As the car stopped one of the guards roughly
  took hold of his neck and whispered into his ear, &quot;Better be good boy.
  Yer about to meet the Lady. Face to face.&quot; 
Act VII 
Steven was forced forward out of the elevator and felt cool tile under his
  feet as he walked along with his guards. He wondered how high up they had gone.
  It seemed warmer and less damp here. Was he above ground again? If they were
  above ground, he might be able to see out a window to find out where he had
  been taken. His mind was a storm of thoughts until the guards abruptly pulled
  him to a stop. He heard the sound of a buzzer and The Lady's voice as if coming
  through a speaker, �Bring him in.� His mind slammed to a halt and his blood
  ran like ice in his veins. 
~~~~~~~~~~
When the door opened, The Lady wordlessly motioned the guards to take the
  slave into her sitting room. She followed behind, watching the boy's weary
  steps. His night had not been nearly as restful as her own had been, and a
  smile curled the corners of her lips at the thought of him twisting and turning
  in the night, trying to get comfortable, to escape the pain she had inflicted,
  to escape the nightmare of his new life. 
As they entered the sitting room, she circled around the three men and took
  a seat in a comfortable, overstuffed leather chair. She then motioned to the
  guards and watched as they forced the slave to his knees in front of her and
  left by the same means they had entered. 
When she heard the soft click of the door closing behind them, she began to
  speak. �So, boy, did you sleep well? You look as though you are unsatisfied
  with my hospitality.� She waited for his answer, delighting in the frustration
  fighting to burst from his bound body. 
~~~~~~~~~~
Steven listened to her through the hood. Her voice was silk today, seductive
  and inviting. But he knew better than to trust it. She was just waiting for
  some excuse to torture him in some new, fiendish way. But still, he wanted
  so badly to scream at her. To tell her what a bitch she really was. To reach
  out and strike her, although he had never struck a woman in his life. 
There was a rush of air past his side, and he realized she had moved while
  he was lost in his own thoughts. Now he had lost track of her, and that terrified
  him. She could do anything now and he would have no warning at all. Suddenly,
  he felt her pulling at the hood that she had pulled over his head the night
  before. With one rough yank, it was removed and he felt cool air against his
  face and in his wet hair. 
�Better.� Her heard her whisper in his ear. It wasn't a question. It said
  that she knew exactly how unbearable the thing was. But then, that was obviously
  the reason she used it. 
He felt her hands on the back of his head next, and suddenly remembered the
  duct tape wrapping around his head. He gritted his teeth, waiting for her to
  rip the sticky material from his hair, but was surprised when she carefully
  peeled the tape away, slowly untangling his hair, causing a minimum of pain.
  She surprised him further by doing the same with his face, carefully removing
  the tape to avoid hurting him further. 
�Thank you,� he found himself whispering hoarsely once he had managed to push
  the damp wad of cloth from his mouth. Was this even the same woman from the
  night before? Or was this some trick? Something to lull him into complacency? 
Then, he felt her hands working at the knot behind his head, and his heart
  began to pound in his chest. She was going to remove the blindfold. Maybe he
  would be able to see out, as he had fantasized on his way here. But � first � he
  would have to see her  and that thought was terrifying. 
&nbsp; 
~~~~~~~~~~
The Lady smiled when he thanked her for removing the gag. She was certain
  he would not be thankful for very long. Because today he would find out what
  was to become of the rest of his life. And they were never thankful for very
  long when that happened. 
Her fingers tugged at the knot securing the blindfold to no avail. Between
  the kidnapper's enthusiasm and the boy's struggling, it had become knotted
  so tightly that trying to untie it was useless. Giving up on this, she chose
  instead to yank the blindfold upward over the boy's head, leaving him blinking
  in the sudden brightness of the room. 
~~~~~~~~~~
Steven found himself squinting his eyes in the sudden brightness of the room.
  For a long moment, everything around him was a white blur. Then, slowly, shapes
  began to come into focus. He realized that he was kneeling in a small sitting
  area. There were leather couches on either side of him and a large leather
  chair directly in front of him. And, he realized The Lady was standing directly
  in front of the chair. 
Act VIII 
She was very tall, easily over six feet. Her skin was very pale and she had
  thick blonde hair cascading down her back and over her shoulders. She was dressed
  all in soft, black velvet. Her feet were bare. 
She studied him for a moment, and then The Lady took a seat in the large leather
  chair. �Don't try to see too much right away. It'll probably take your eyes
  some time to adjust.� She crossed her legs in the chair and shifted to make
  herself more comfortable. 
�Your name is Steven Hazleton,� she began. �You work for Advanced Cosmetic
  Micro Systems as a consumer analyst. Your boss recently told you that you needed
  to take a long vacation or lose all of your built up paid time � a change in
  company policy, I believe. So, you announced this week that you would be gone
  for the next month. You have no close friends or family, so you will not be
  missed for at least that amount of time.� 
The Lady looked up and saw the boy's wide, horrified eyes. Doubtless he was
  frantically trying to figure out where she had gotten her information. 
She reached over to a side table and picked up a thick notebook that appeared
  to have been filled to capacity with papers. Opening the notebook, she began
  to read aloud. The first document in the folder was his birth certificate.
  After that followed his social security number and tax records. The notebook
  also held his employment history, his criminal record (empty save for a few
  parking and speeding tickets), and his old school transcripts. On and on it
  went until she had read through each page of the folder. 
�Do you realize what this is?� she asked pointedly. �It is everything in this
  world that proves that you ever existed.� 
He nodded numbly. He couldn't deny that she was right. 
�Do you know what I could do to you with the stroke of a key? I could make
  you disappear. I could make it as though you had never been.� She paused for
  a moment, one long painted nail tapping her lips. �No one would look for you,
  you know. No one would miss you. Well, no one but a bunch of loonies trying
  to pull a hoax on the cops by reporting someone missing who doesn't even exist� she
  mused. 
~~~~~~~~~~
Steven sat in stunned silence. His mind was reeling with what she had just
  told him. How could she have gotten that much information on him? How could
  she have access to those computer systems? Could she really  erase
  him? And if she did, what would she do with him instead? 
~~~~~~~~~~
There was a long silence as The Lady let what she had just told the boy sink
  in. There was always that stunned moment when they tried to decide if she was
  serious or not. It was always so hard for them to believe that she could erase
  them from the world with the touch of a few buttons. And she loved that about
  this world. Everything was so accessible. 
�I'm going to be brutally honest with you now.� She said. �You have already
  been removed from all of these systems. It was done last night, just about
  the time my men were picking you up from work.� 
His head snapped up, his eyes wide in horror and his mouth open as though
  he was trying to speak. 
�We used to fake our quarry's death, but that became bothersome. We could
  only count on so many natural disasters, and it gets more and more difficult
  to fake a murder on this world. So, now we just erase them the night they are
  captured. It saves us so much time and needless work.� She explained to him. 
�S � So, what's going to happen to me? Why the hell did you kidnap me if you're
  not going to kill me?� She could tell he was trying to sound angry, but the
  slight tremor in his voice gave him away. He was terrified of her answer. And
  she liked it that way. 
�I'm going to sell you, of course.� She answered as if she were explaining
  this to a two-year-old who should already know better. �This afternoon you
  will be sent to the auction house and sold to the highest bidder. I'll get
  a commission for my hard work and research. My men will get paid. And you will
  begin a whole new life as a slave.� 
Act IX 
Steven sat in stunned silence. He could think of no words to convey his thoughts
  and feelings. His heart was hammering in his chest. He felt the blood draining
  from his face and was sure that he would faint in a moment. 
He watched as The Lady picked up a remote control from the same table where
  she had picked up the notebook from. She pressed a button on the remote and
  waited quietly, studying the notebook. A moment later, there was the soft click
  of the apartment door opening. The Lady smiled sweetly at him as the guards
  returned and pulled him to his feet, dragging him away. 
It was strange finally being able to see his surroundings. He realized that
  The Lady's apartment was richly furnished in leather and marble and other expensive
  amenities. But, outside, it was all bare concrete and institutional tiling
  and flickering florescent lights. The place was chilling, reminding him of
  those insane asylums in old horror movies where the patients go wild and kill
  all of the nursing staff in horrible, bloody ways. 
Back in the dungeon, as he had come to think of it, the guards forced him
  back down the hall. He was taken into a room that looked like a high school
  gym shower with several different shower heads on the wall and sickly lime-green
  tiles on the floor and walls. 
One of the guards shoved a bar of soap into his hands while the other shoved
  him into the showers. �Get cleaned up. If you don't do it yourself, we'll have
  to do it for you.� A strange light entered his eyes at this and Steven thought
  it better to comply with them. There was no telling what they would do to him
  if they were �forced� to bathe him. 
~~~~~~~~~~
After the slave was gone, The Lady returned to her computer. There, she began
  to type out all of the needed papers for the boy's transfer to Nakrad. She
  filled in his given name, his approximate age, his physical description. She
  recommended that he be trained as a Pleasure Slave. His build would not do
  him much good in the gladiator ring or under the hard labor of the salt mines.
  And his good looks would be wasted in either pursuit. Finally she recommended
  a sale price for the auction master and began to print the forms. The sky was
  already darkening, and he was to be shipped at sundown. 
~~~~~~~~~~
After his shower, Steven was turned over to a team of women. While a guard
  stood by the door, he was guided into a chair in front of a large mirror. He
  was then carefully groomed, his hair cut and combed into place, his face shaved
  clean, and his eyebrows shaped. It was all done so quickly that Steven was
  left wondering what they were preparing him for. Certainly it was not for The
  Lady. She had already seen him at his worst, he was sure. 
Then, suddenly he remembered and the blood in his veins turned to ice. They
  were preparing him to be sold. He was going to be sold  to some new
  sadist. He did not exist any more. No one would be looking for him! 
He felt all the blood draining from his face and his head swam as though he
  would faint. He was vaguely aware of laughter in the room around him, and then
  a stinging slap on his cheek brought him back to reality. �None of that now,� one
  of the women said. �It's time for you to go!� 
~~~~~~~~~~
At sunset, The Lady began the journey to the transport room deep in the bowels
  of the building. There, in a huge concrete room, stood a strange metal contraption.
  It looked like a delicate hoop of shimmering silver wound about with delicate
  golden threads. Etched into the silver were intricate runes. Just the presence
  of it seemed to make the room hum with magical energy. 
She heard the sound of the doors opening behind her and looked back to see
  the guards escorting the slave into the room. He looked much better after a
  shower and a shave even though he appeared to be on the verge of collapse between
  them. His face was pale and he was beginning to sweat in fear. Apparently,
  it had finally dawned on him that she had not been kidding before when she
  had told him what would become of him. 
Turning back to the silver hoop, she raised her hands, palm out, and began
  to recite the magical incantation that would bring the gateway to life, filling
  it with swirling gold and silver energy. The light was incredibly bright at
  first, blinding all present for a moment before slowly fading again. The hoop
  now appeared to be filled with liquid quicksilver. The surface rippled gently,
  and sparks of gold glitter appeared from time to time as The Lady watched to
  make sure the connection would hold. There was not much magic on this planet
  and sometimes the gateways did not want to work properly. 
Satisfied that all was well, she turned to the slave. �This is the gateway
  to my world. Once you step through, there will be no way back. You will enter
  the auction house and be sold to your new owner. You will not be missed, except
  by those who actually knew you in this life, but they will never be able to
  find you. To the authorities of this world, you do not exist and you never
  did.� 
She was standing in front of him now and could hear his quickened, terrified
  breathing. She would almost have enjoyed keeping this one. She was sure he
  would be a delight to break and train. But that was not part of the deal. Her
  job was to find them and send them on their way. When she finished with this
  assignment, she could have all the toys she wanted, but not yet. 
She pulled her eyes away and looked at the guards. �Boys, help him through.� 
She stepped back as the guards drug the slave forward. He bad begun to thrash
  and try to fight them. They were used to this reaction, though, and soon had
  his arms twisted behind his back and were surely guiding him up the ramp leading
  into the portal. 
The cast one last frightened glance back over his shoulder at The Lady before
  he was shoved through the portal, never to return.
