The Shock of the View
Provided By: BDSM Librarywww.bdsmlibrary.com
Synopsis: After Pieter Breughel\'s adventures in \"Art for Art\'s Sake\" he is asked to investigate when artist\'s models go missing. It\'s another romp through the world of art with a BDSM background, though if you are seeking a lot of heavy stuff and grinding sex should look elsewhere - this is pretty light and closer to a mainstream detective tale.

1: Hunters in the Snow

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Brueghel_the_elder_-_Hunters_in_the_snow.jpg

&nbsp;

It was too bloody
cold. Pieter Breughel looked out across the wintry scene that he was painting.
He was already thinking he should have set up his easel closer to the inn and
the bonfire that was flaming so attractively outside
it. Sure, the view was better from here but it was, as he had already decided,
too bloody cold.

&nbsp;

The mobile phone
in his pocket went off. Its piercing ring tone, a rip from Hocus
Pocus by Focus, startled the hunting dogs as they
passed following their masters down to the lake. Breughel fumbled in his
overcoat for the phone and answered it. 

&nbsp;

�Ya,� he said, �is Breughel.� He
was famously abrupt and his telephone manner did nothing to dispel the
impression that answering telephone calls was not one of his great life
pleasures.

&nbsp;

�Pieter?� He recognised the voice at the other end
as Janine Schenk, the British super-realist.

&nbsp;

�Ya,� he said. �What can I do for you, Janine?�

&nbsp;

�I have a friend,�
she said. �He needs some help.�

&nbsp;

�We all need some
help sometimes.�

&nbsp;

�This is rather
specialised help. The sort of help you gave me recently.� Pieter felt weary.
The trip to London had taken a lot out of him. Nobody likes
seeing people killed and the business with Vallance
had been messy. He�d been pleased that Schenk had come out of it all right but
as for the trustees of the National Gallery and the Tate; well, they should
have seen it coming.

&nbsp;

�I dunno, Janine,� he responded warily, �I�m working on
�Hunters in the Snow�. It�s a commission for the Kunsthistoriches Museum in Vienna.�

&nbsp;

�Oh, come on
Pieter,� Janine sounded impatient. �Another of those genre paintings?
You know you don�t have to stand around out of doors to do them. You must have
enough snow scenes in your gallery to recreate the arctic. This will be more
interesting. And it will be warmer.�

&nbsp;

�Warmer?� said
Pieter. Suddenly the opportunity that Janine was presenting sounded more
interesting. His breath was already turning to ice in his beard. 

&nbsp;

�Come to Italy, Pieter, come to Rome. There�s someone here that wants to meet
you.�

&nbsp;

A group of small
boys ran past where Breughel was painting. Their snow fight managed to shower
him with cold white powder. His fingers were already getting numb. It had been
a stupid idea to try to paint this outside. It was alright for those
impressionists in their nice, warm, south of France sun but it didn�t work here in Breda. It didn�t take much more effort on
Janine�s part to make him agree.�� 

�

2&nbsp;:La Gioconda

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Mona_Lisa.jpg

&nbsp;

The �plane touched
down at Rome�s international airport. As Pieter stepped
across to the bus from the foot of the aircraft steps he looked across at the
terminal building. �Bloody hell,� he thought, �they�ve even named the airport
after him.�

&nbsp;

Janine was waiting
in the arrival hall when he had collected his baggage. She waved as he came
through the barrier. He smiled back. All right, he was probably old enough to
be her father but that didn�t stop him appreciating her dark, slight good looks
in a most un-fatherly way. He�d never gone in for painting women in the nude.
Maybe he was making a mistake, he thought. He pushed the trolley with his bag
on across to where she was standing.

&nbsp;

�Hi, Pieter,� she
smiled. �He�s sent a car. Just through here.� Janine waved a set of car keys
and pointed to the exit. Outside Pieter could see a Lamborghini Miura.

&nbsp;

�I wouldn�t have
thought that was his style,� Pieter said. �I had him down as more of an
aesthete.� Janine shrugged. Pieter guessed, given Janine�s current enthusiasm
for super-real pictures of classic cars, that she was more than happy with
their assigned transport. He followed her out to the car. She climbed in and he
followed suite, balancing his bag on his lap. It wasn�t an easy manoeuvre �
either the getting in or the balancing of his bag. The cockpit of the car was
hardly roomy. He just hoped they hadn�t far to go.� 

&nbsp;

Janine swung the
car confidently out of the airport and on to the A12 Autostrada
Azzura. They were heading north, Pieter decided. The
Miura growled as Janine slipped through the afternoon traffic. Comforted by her assured handling of the car, Pieter relaxed and
started to enjoy the ride. �Where are we going?� he asked.

&nbsp;

�Tarquinia,� Janine replied slicing between two enormous
trucks. Pieter looked up at the cab of the truck. The driver�s foot board was
above his head. The relaxed feeling evaporated. �He�s got a villa near there,�
Janine went on. �He�ll explain all about it when we get there.�

�� 

�If we get there,�
thought Pieter, clutching his bag tighter as Janine slipped though another
disturbingly small gap.

&nbsp;

By the time Janine
skidded the car to a halt outside the villa, Pieter was convinced he had lost
several pounds in fright-induced sweat but they arrived without a scratch on
the car or themselves. Pieter unfolded himself from inside the car,
straightening up with care, his joints still stiff from the flight. The warmth
of the afternoon was adequate compensation for the terrors of the drive. As he
looked around a bald man with a long flowing beard came bustling out of the
villa. �Hey, Pete, hey!� the figure called.

&nbsp;

�Leonardo!� Pieter
acknowledged. �Good to meet you!�

&nbsp;

�Please,� the
other said, �it�s Leo. To my friends it�s Leo.
Everyone else it�s �Mr Da V� but to friends it�s
Leo.�

&nbsp;

�Leo,� said Pieter
taking his hand. He looked around. �Nice place.�

&nbsp;

Leo was looking at
Janine as she bent over the car, pulling her handbag from where she had wedge
it between the seats. �Nice arse,� he hissed conspiratorially then, as Janine
stood up. �Come in both of you. Come in.�

&nbsp;

A rather effete
looking man was waiting at the door and offered to take their bags. Leo
introduced him as il Salaino. Pieter wasn�t sure what the relationship was
between them. Leo didn�t bother to explain.

&nbsp;

The building was
old but the interior was packed with electronics and other gadgetry. Leo showed
them though into a large sunlit lounge. He pressed a few buttons, blinds closed
the window and a screen dropped from the ceiling.

&nbsp;

�Here,� said Leo.
�Do you get to watch TV?�

&nbsp;

Pieter shook his
head. He had cable in one of the flats in Breda but there had never seemed to be anything
on that he wanted to watch. Besides he was pretty busy most of the time.

&nbsp;

�You should, you
should, Pete. You paint the man in the street � this is what he does; what he
watches.�� Leo thumbed a remote control
and the screen flickered into life. �Now this is one big show�.�

&nbsp;

�America�s Next Top Model� the title said over a
series of pictures of girls strutting along a cat walk.

&nbsp;

�Leo, you�re not
planning to launch a line of designer clothing are you?� Janine cut in.

&nbsp;

Leo looked puzzled
for a moment but then scribbled a note on a pad of paper. �Interesting thought,
Miss Schenk,� he said. �Interesting thought. No, just watch for a moment. It�s
not that sort of model.�

&nbsp;

The program went
on. A group of girls were sitting in a room, listening to a presentation by
another girl and then the scene dissolved to an artist�s studio. �Twelve
girls,� the commentary began, �one ambition. To be part of the world�s greatest
painting. This is the race to find America�s next Top Model!!!� 

&nbsp;

�World�s
greatest painting. Pah!� grunted Leo. �In America? Pah!�

&nbsp;

The programme
continued. Each girl was being asked to show her abilities to pose and to
remain motionless. The camera panned along the line. The soundtrack was giving
a short biography of each. Telephone numbers appeared on the screen inviting
the audience to vote for their choice. As the camera reached one girl with dark
waving hair Leo froze the frame. �Look,� he said pointing to the girl�s blank
look.

&nbsp;

�Very attractive,�
said Breughel. �She should do well, within the limits of the programme.�

&nbsp;

�That�s not the
point,� said Leo. �That�s my model. I am half way through her portrait. She
disappeared two weeks ago. Now she turns up there. Something must be done.� He
reached behind the couch on which he was sitting and pulled out a half finished
canvas.

&nbsp;

Janine looked at
it. Even in its current state it was impressive. The girl in the picture was
staring out of the frame at the viewer, a curious half smile on her lips. Leo
had obviously been having trouble with representing it; clipped to the
stretcher of the canvas were a series of sketches of the girl�s mouth as he had
tried to work out exactly how to show it. 

&nbsp;

Pieter turned to
Leo. �So, your model decides to take off. She turns up in the USA. She wants to find some fame and fortune.
Is that new? It�s difficult of course when you have a picture half finished
like this but what can we artists do? That�s models for you.�

&nbsp;

�It�s not like
that,� said Leo with a determined look on his face. He tugged irritably at his
beard. �No, something else is going on. There have been others. Not seen on
this show but there have been others. Ingres has lost
a model. Velazquez too. Perhaps
three or four more. There is the welfare of these girls to consider.�

&nbsp;

�And
the inconvenience of the artists too?� Janine interjected.

&nbsp;

Leo scowled at
her. �Of course. But you should understand that. Or do
you just work from photographs these days?�

&nbsp;

Janine nearly came
back with some remark to the effect that at least her paintings didn�t fade the
minute they got up on the walls but, in the end, ignored the jibe at the way
that she and many super-realists approached their work. Pieter cut in to stop
the thing descending into an argument over artistic technique. �So, Leo,� he
said. �What do you want me to do?�

&nbsp;

�Find her,� he
pointed to the screen. The programme had run on and now Leo�s model was draped
across a couch in a state of undress. The pose she was adopting didn�t really
fit with the prim individual in Leo�s portrait. �and
bring her back here.�

&nbsp;

�Maybe I can do
the first. The second? Who knows? I can try. What can
you tell me about her?�

&nbsp;

�She�s a local girl, Donna Vellani.� 

&nbsp;

�I�d heard you
were painting Lisa Gherardini � that�s not this
picture then?

&nbsp;

�I�m still arguing
with Francesco Del Giocondo about that one. He�s a
difficult man. You know what these Florentine�s are like!�

&nbsp;

Il Salino came back into the room clutching a telephone. �It�s
for you,� he said. �It�s �� He looked at Breughel and Janine, �well, it�s�.you
know.�

&nbsp;

Leo tutted and took the phone from him. �Hello, Pierre. Yes, I see. No. Well, that�s very
concerning. No, no I don�t think I can help. I�m very busy right now. Have you
tried Nicholas? Yes, Nicholas, Nicholas Poussin.
He might be able to help. He�d be worth a call anyway. � All
right. � Good bye, Pierre.��
He broke the connection. Leo turned back to Pieter and Janine.� �Lunatic!� he said. Brueghel
looked puzzled. �Pierre Plantard. His delusions about
the Priory of Sion will cause a great deal of
trouble. He wants me to be involved. I�ve told him no.�

&nbsp;

�So, it is all a
myth then? Just a hoax as many claim?�

&nbsp;

�Certainly for Plantard,� said Leo with a wink. �But what good would a
secret society be if you let people find out about it?�

&nbsp;

Breughel felt
himself warming to the man. Janine was sitting quietly listening to all that
was being said and watching the television programme as the various tasks the
girls were being given were played out.

&nbsp;

�Well, Leo, if I
wanted to help. I say IF. If I wanted to help, will the others talk?�

&nbsp;

�Perhaps. I will do what I can to persuade them.
Here,� he gave Pieter a paper with an address on it, �Donna Vellani
was staying in Rome, down on the Corso Vittorio
Emmanuelle. But there is one other you should see.�

&nbsp;

�Who is that?�

&nbsp;

�Victorine Meurent.� Janine sat up
at the sound of the woman�s name. She was a famous beauty, whose cool elegance
had transfixed Paris only a few months earlier. �She is the president of the Artistic
Posers Collective � it�s a sort of model�s union � she will have an interest in
this too. You�ll find her villa a little further down the coast.� 

3: Olympia

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Manet%2C_Edouard_-_Olympia%2C_1863.jpg

&nbsp;

Victorine Meurent lounged
back on her chaise-longue, looking towards Breughel
with barely concealed contempt. She was naked apart from a thin black ribbon
around her neck. One hand was draped decorously across her lap but her gaze dared
the man to look away from her pale body. �So,� she said, �suddenly the artists
wish to take an interest in our affairs. Freezing studios, weak absinthe, poor
wages were all good enough before. Now, though, now they want to give us a
detective!�

&nbsp;

�Mister Da V is very concerned for the welfare of the models,�
Pieter responded. �He is only trying to help.�

&nbsp;

�Mister Da V is concerned for the welfare of Mister Da V. He knows that without models he would have to go back
to painting fruit or, worse still, landscapes.� Breughel held his tongue; he
knew the girl�s taunt was directed at his own work. 

&nbsp;

Breughel shrugged.
�Well, perhaps you are right. If you don�t feel I can help then�.� He made to
pick up his cap and started turn to the door.�

&nbsp;

�No. Wait.� Victorine said. She reached out for a small bell on the
table beside her and rang it. 

&nbsp;

Her black maid
servant appeared clutching a vast bunch of flowers. �From Monsieur Manet,� the maid said. �He hopes you will see him later.�

&nbsp;

Victorine looked bored. �Perhaps,� she said. �I will
think about it, but for now I want no callers.�

&nbsp;

�Very good madam,�
the maid said, putting the flowers down beside Victorine�s
couch.

&nbsp;

Victorine swung her pale legs down from the couch
gathering her robe about her. As she did so she disturbed the black cat that
was sitting near her feet. It hissed and buried itself under the couch. �Come,�
she said, gesturing to a group of armchairs arranged around the fire on the far
side of the room. �I shall give you a hearing and we shall see. You�ll take
some tea?�

&nbsp;

Breughel nodded.
He gestured towards Janine. �I should introduce my associate, Miss Schenk.�

&nbsp;

�Associate?� said Victorine sceptically. �A new word for
it.�

&nbsp;

�I am an artist in
my own right, mademoiselle,� Janine responded feeling prickly. �Members of your
organisation have sat for my works.�

&nbsp;

�An innovation!�
exclaimed Victorine. �A woman
behind the easel instead of in front of it. Whatever will things come to
if the world is exposed to women�s views instead of views of women?� Her voice
was heavy with irony and she looked at Janine with an evident degree of
distaste.

&nbsp;

The maid arrived
with a tray of tea things and poured each of them a cup. Victorine
pulled her wrap more closely about her. �There have been six girls to my
knowledge. At least two of them have turned up on the programme that you talk
of but of the others, no trace. We have tried to get messages to them but there
have been no replies. There may be nothing to worry about. Mr Da V and the others have been inconvenienced but that is
hardly our concern. I am more worried about the welfare of my members, though.
If there is any suggestion that these girls have not gone of the own accord��

&nbsp;

�Do you believe
that to be the case?�

&nbsp;

Victorine shrugged. �It is hard to say. Our members
are often impulsive. The life of a model is hardly one of stability and
conventional morality.� She granted Janine an acidic look. �It mirrors that of
our employers.� Janine returned it. �I do know that at least one was planning
to be in Florence this week but is not there and another had
said she expected to be in Rome and is not there either. Let us say that I suspect
that all is not as it should be.�

&nbsp;

�Go on,� Breughel
urged.

&nbsp;

�One
of the girls at least.
I was surprised that she would go off without at least a word to others. She
was working with Buonarotti. In Rome. He was furious when she left.�

&nbsp;

Breughel felt no
enthusiasm for a meeting with Michelangelo. A mercurial figure at best, he was
too prone to solving problems with his fists for the quiet Belgian.

&nbsp;

�In fact,� said Victorine. �Two of the others were last heard of in Rome. It could be a good place to start.� 

&nbsp;

Breughel grunted.
�You�ll let me have a list?� he asked. �Names, employers, date and place last
seen.�

&nbsp;

Victorine nodded and reached for her bell. The maid
appeared again. �The ledger,� Victorine called. The
girl left and returned with a large black leather
bound book. Victorine copied out some details from it
and passed the paper to Pieter. He got to his feet and Janine followed suite.
�Do call me,� Victorine said to Janine, �if you ever
decide to hang up your brushes. I�m sure there are many that would love to �..�

&nbsp;

�Of course,� said
Janine in as sweet a voice as she could muster, �though I don�t think it
likely.� She and Breughel took their leave.������ 

&nbsp;

4: The Creation

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:God2-Sistine_Chapel.png

&nbsp;

Pieter and Janine
headed back towards Rome. If anything Janine�s driving was more aggressive
than before. Pieter winced as she carved the Miura between two small vans and
slipped down a gear to accelerate away from them, earning a growl of
appreciation from the gear box.

&nbsp;

�Bitch,� she
muttered under her breath.

&nbsp;

Pieter heard her
but chose not to be drawn. It was obvious that Janine and Victorine
hadn�t seen eye to eye. Whatever her views on the emancipation of women might
be, it was clear which side of an easel Victorine
thought a woman should be.

&nbsp;

They picked up the
autostrada just before Civitavecchia but the traffic was still too heavy to
allow Janine to take advantage of the V12, 4 litre engine.
The exhaust grumbled as she wove through the stream of cars heading towards Rome.

&nbsp;

At the edge of the
city, Janine took the circonvallazione north to pick
up the Via Aurelia. The Carabinieri were less than
impressed with the way that Janine swung the Lamborghini into St Peter�s
Square. A contingent of Swiss Guard approach them as
Janine and Pieter climbed out. �Friends of Mr Da V,�
Janine called as they reached the car. The guards stiffened at the mention of
the artist and engineer. She tossed the cars keys to the first guard. �Can you
park it please?� she smiled, winsomely. �We�ll be in the Capella
Sistina.�

&nbsp;

The guard smiled.
�Sure,� he said. �But watch out. We�ve got workmen in there. They�re doing some
stuff to the ceiling.�

&nbsp;

�Thanks,� called
Janine, leading Pieter to the door to the chapel. Pieter looked back to the
scene in the square. The guards were arguing about which of them would actually
get to park the car. Pieter thought there might be a few more kilometers on the clock than was strictly needed by the
time they got it back.����� 

&nbsp;

Pieter had heard
great things about the Sistine Chapel but right now the place resembled a
building site more than an artist�s studio. A large hydraulic platform stood at
one end of the chapel, its legs extended so that those working on it could
easily reach the ceiling 60 feet above the ground.

&nbsp;

�Hey Mike,� Janine
called up. �Are you going to be up there all day?�

&nbsp;

�Janine, hey!� the
artist responded with spontaneous warmth. �Hold on, I�ll be right down.� He
barked some orders to the others working on the platform alongside him, and
scrambled down the ladder from the platform to the floor of the chapel. He
picked up a cloth to wipe the paint from his hands and then embraced Janine
affectionately. �Still keeping it real?�

&nbsp;

�Better than
that,� she laughed. �Do you know Pieter?�

&nbsp;

Breughel extended
his hand. �It�s an honour to meet you,� he said sincerely.

&nbsp;

�Naturally,� Michelangelo
responded in the manner of a man known for his lack of modesty. Janine gave him
a scolding look. �And, of course, you. Your work with
the everyday is as great in its field as is mine with the divine.� 

&nbsp;

Breughel�s natural
tendency to the taciturn made him wary of the Italian�s over blown manner. �We
hear that one of your models ran off. Mr da V thought
it might help if he could find her.�

&nbsp;

Michelangelo
looked annoyed. �Inconsiderate slut!� he snapped. �If Eve cannot be relied upon
what chance is there for the rest of womankind? Look!� He pointed to a drawing
on a sheet of paper hanging on one wall of the chapel. In the picture the head
and shoulders of a woman were peering out from under the arm of God at the act
of creation. �It was almost complete, I was ready to
transfer it to the ceiling. The plaster was already applied and wet, She should have been on hand if I needed to check any
slight detail. And what do I find?�

&nbsp;

�What?� said Pieter.

&nbsp;

�Nothing! I come back from lunch to find she has
gone. No letter, no message, nothing. We�ve had to chip the plaster off again.
I don�t know what we will do if she doesn�t come back. Sure I can get on with
the rest for now but it will have to be done soon.�� 

&nbsp;

�You�ve tried to
find her at home?�

&nbsp;

�Of
course! At home, her parents, her � how you say � �significant other�.
No sign. None of them know where she has gone or that she was planning to go
anywhere.�

&nbsp;

�And
the police?� Janine
asked.

&nbsp;

�Why should they
be interested? She�s a model. They come and go, they say. How can you expect anything else, they say. They took the
details but I don�t think they took much notice.�

&nbsp;

�But you have
friends in high places. Didn�t you try Julius?� Pieter thought that the Pope
ought to have been able to help.

&nbsp;

�You think he can spare
his time worrying about one girl. You know what he said? Mikey,
baby, he says, you do the pictures, you worry about the fucking girls. I gotta church to run. You think you got problems with girls,
let me tell you how many nuns I gotta worry about. That�s
what he said. So I got a ceiling with a big hole in it right now. If you can find her, then great.� 

&nbsp;

Pieter listened.
He could understand why Luther was pushing things the way he was. �Can you tell
us where she was staying?� He�d already concluded that he wouldn�t learn much
from Buonarotti.

&nbsp;

Michelangelo gave
them an address for his model, Gina Perdice. She�d
been living in an apartment down near the Piazza Navona.
Pieter said he�d do what he could. He and Janine left the painter climbing back
up to the ceiling, haranguing his assistants and yelling at the plasterers for
putting up more than the painters could hope to cover before it dried. Back in
the sunlight that streamed down on St Peter�s Square. Pieter confided in
Janine, �I�m not sure this is getting anywhere yet.�

&nbsp;

She shook her
head. �No, the artists take little interest in the models apart from peering at
them when they are painting or fucking them when they�re not.�

&nbsp;

Pieter was
sometimes affronted by Janine�s language but he didn�t disagree with her
analysis. They walked together slowly. �I think we should try the addresses
that Victorine and Leo gave us,� Pieter said. �If you
take these three, I�ll do the others. Just try to see if anyone knows when they
went missing; if they remember anything odd about the girls; if they had any
callers. Let�s check these out and then we�ll go see Gina Perdice�s
place.�� 

&nbsp;

Janine nodded.
�Sure,� she said. �Where will I meet you?�

&nbsp;

Pieter thought for
a moment. �How about by the Trevi Fountain at seven o�clock�

&nbsp;

Janine said,
�Fine.� She waved and headed off across the street dodging between the hooting
traffic of the late afternoon.

&nbsp;

Pieter trudged off
in the opposite direction with his own list. He knew that leg work was the
heart of detection but that didn�t make it any more interesting. 

&nbsp;

When they met
again they were both feeling despondent. The views of those they had spoken to
were remarkably consistent. �She was a model. They come and go don�t they? How would I know where she is? No she hasn�t paid the
rent � either before she left or after. No I don�t remember any callers. I
don�t let the girls bring guests in here. What sort of a house do you think
this is?�

&nbsp;

�What we need,�
said Janine, �is to get closer to things. Listen. When
we get to Gina Perdice�s apartment let me talk to the
landlady. I�ve got an idea but you�ll need to go along with it.�

&nbsp;

Spontaneity wasn�t
Breughel�s strongest suit but he was happy to let Janine take the lead.

&nbsp;

The apartment
block was a big rambling building, the made their way through the warren of
corridors until they found an old woman carrying bundles of washing. �We�re
looking for Gina Perdice.�

&nbsp;

The woman
responded immediately. �She�s not here. I told Buonarotti
already. I don�t know where she is.��� 

&nbsp;

�I know,� said
Janine, �he suggested I could take her room.�

&nbsp;

The woman
shrugged. �I don�t mind who pays the rent.� She looked her up and down. �You working for Buonarotti?�

&nbsp;

Janine shook her
head. �No. For this man.� She grabbed Pieter by the
arm and smiled warmly at him.

&nbsp;

The old woman
grunted. �Another artist, eh?� She prodded Breughel
inquisitorially. �Is she going to earn enough posing for you to pay her rent?�

&nbsp;

Breughel, taking
his cue as promised, nodded.

&nbsp;

�What do I care?�
she said. �As long as she has the money! It�s that
room there.� She pointed across the corridor. �And you! Artist!� she waved at
Pieter. �You wanna fuck your model you do it
somewhere else.�

&nbsp;

Pieter doffed his
hat at the woman and muttered an assurance of probity. The two of them left her
and went into the room. Pieter looked as if he was sucking a lemon.

&nbsp;

Janine collapsed
on the bed laughing. �Your face!� she giggled.

&nbsp;

�I am not used to
being accused of sexual impropriety,� Breughel said stuffily.

&nbsp;

�Well,� said
Janine, �you have now installed your devastatingly attractive model in her
sordid apartment. You shall take a small studio somewhere. I shall model for
you. We shall see what happens. Maybe I will find things out from some of the
other girls.�

&nbsp;

�I am not a fan of
these under-cover operations,� Breughel said. �This could be very risky for
you.�

&nbsp;

�I can look after
myself, Pieter,� Janine responded.

&nbsp;

Pieter felt like
reminding her that she hadn�t been able to look after herself when she was
snatched from the Delacroix exhibition and that he�d ended up pulling her out
of that with the death of three of her guards. He looked at her determined
face. It was obvious that she�d made up her mind. �I�d better find some paints
and a canvas, then,� Breughel said. 

5: Odalisque With A Slave

&nbsp;

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Ingres%2C_Odalisque_with_a_slave.jpg

&nbsp;

Pieter Breughel
was taking a morning coffee on the Piazza Navona. He
winced at the sight of Janine Schenk as she approached him across the square. 

&nbsp;

She was wearing an
acid green blouse of a material that was sheer enough to make it plain she was
wearing a black bra beneath it. Her skirt stretched to below her knees but was
so tight that it provided all those watching with a perfect appreciation of the
line of her buttocks and thighs. The black satin material glinted in the
morning sunlight.

&nbsp;

He was sitting
outside the caf� where they had arranged to meet. We need to be seen, she�d
said. The artist and his model. He looked at his
canvases, brushes and easel, propped ostentatiously beside his seat. He looked
back at the girl advancing towards him. There wasn�t much risk that they
wouldn�t be noticed, he thought. Worst luck!

&nbsp;

Now she strode
straight up to him and sat down, giving the hem of her skirt an exaggerated tug
downwards as she crossed her legs. Seeing Pieter�s response, she smiled at him
and blew him a kiss. The smirks of the men and the scowls of the women at
adjacent tables told Breughel exactly what they thought about his companion.

&nbsp;

Pieter picked up
the tiny cup of espresso coffee and peered over it at Janine�s back-combed and
teased hair. �Very convincing,� he said quietly.

&nbsp;

�I thought so,�
laughed Janine. �Relax. It will do your reputation the world of good.�

&nbsp;

�I hadn�t realised
that �model� was a synonym for �prostitute� these days.�

&nbsp;

�You�re reading
the wrong papers.�

&nbsp;

She was right,
thought Breughel. He was feeling increasingly out of touch with the man in the
street. 

&nbsp;

Janine grinned at
Pieter�s discomfort. It got worse as Pieter realised that a girl in an
exceptionally abbreviated skirt and a low cut top seemed to be waving at him.
His relief was evident as he realised that she was waving at Janine rather than
himself. 

&nbsp;

�Ciao!� the girl
exclaimed as she arrived at their table. She sat down and tossed her capacious
shoulder bag onto the table. As she leant forward to pull a pack of cigarettes
from the bag, Pieter realised that he was being afforded a view of her cleavage
that practically allowed him to see her navel.

&nbsp;

�This is Francesca
Corone,� Janine announced. �We met at the apartments
and I�ve got a job!� Janine leapt forward and clutched Pieter around the neck
in an exaggerated show of affection. �We could have a clue,� she hissed quietly
in his ear as she hugged him.

&nbsp;

�Si,� said Francesca. �We have a real chance to be in an
important picture. For Mr Ingres.
You know him?�

&nbsp;

Pieter nodded. Who
hadn�t heard of the painter of the debauched pictures that had outraged Paris
in spite of his attempt to justify them as a sociological study of girls
involved in the sex industry in the near and middle east. �More
odalisques?� Pieter asked.

&nbsp;

Janine nodded but
seeing his concern said, �It�s all very proper. Mr Ingres
has assured us. We shall be chaperoned at all times.�

&nbsp;

�I�m pleased to
hear it,� said Brueghel stuffily. 

&nbsp;

�Come and see,�
said Janine, �we are starting this morning.�

&nbsp;

Breughel grunted
acceptance, downed the last of his coffee, tossed a few coins on the table,
picked up his easel and canvases and followed Janine and Francesca across the
piazza. In spite of himself, he found he was enjoying
the site of the two girls� backsides as they strode out as well as their tight
skirts would allow them.

&nbsp;

Ingres studio, in a tall Moorish building at the
back of the Spanish Steps, looked more like a Turkish harem than an artist�s
workplace but he greeted Breughel warmly. He shooed the girls away to change,
smiling at the way they giggled and grabbed at the bolts of brightly coloured
and embroidered silks that were draped around the room. �I�m surprised to see
you in Rome, Breughel,� Ingres
said.

&nbsp;

�It was cold in Antwerp,� Pieter replied, �and besides, I like
pizza,�

&nbsp;

Ingres gave him a sideways look, not certain
whether or not he was being humorous. Pieter noticed a rather serious looking
woman sitting in the corner of the room. Ingres waved
her forward, �Pieter, do you know Madame Berthe Morisot�

&nbsp;

Pieter nodded.
They had met some time ago in Paris.

&nbsp;

�Berthe will be keeping an eye on me to make sure I am not
taking any liberties with the girls. She is quite incorruptible, I am sure you
will agree,� Ingres said, evidently irritated by the
need to employ a chaperone as well as the models.

&nbsp;

�You are right. I
am sure that with Madame Morisot in attendance the
good reputation of the girls and yourself should be well assured.� Pieter took
his leave of Ingres, Janine, and Berthe
Morisot. He had work to do.

&nbsp;

He spent the day
trying to talk to some of the other girls that had worked for Michealangelo. Sure they knew �Eve� but no one had seen her
since she disappeared. Too many girls were going missing they said. It wasn�t a
safe job any more. They were all looking for other things to do, working in
cafes, jobs in the clubs or the theatres, anything was better than modelling at
the moment. 

&nbsp;

Breughel didn�t
feel that he was getting very far. It would probably be useful to see if Janine
had discovered anything, he thought and headed for the flat she was sharing
with Francesca. The place was deserted. 

&nbsp;

Pieter called
Dominique. �Dom,� he said, �Is Janine still with you? She didn�t show up at her
flat yet.�

&nbsp;

�I left her with
Francesca and Berthe They were
getting dressed, I had to be over here, I had a call to meet with some guys.
They didn�t show up either.�

&nbsp;

Now Pieter was
worried. �Meet me at the studio,� he said, �as quickly as you can.�

&nbsp;

The two of them
arrived at Ingres�s Spanish Steps studio at almost
the same time. Dominique fumbled with his keys trying to open the door. As soon
as they got in, the muffled moans coming from upstairs confirmed Pieter�s
anxieties. The two of them bounded up the stairs. In
the room that Dominique used to let his models change they found Madame Morisot.

&nbsp;

She had been
blindfolded, bound and gagged and tied to a large, heavy wooden chair. She was
struggling against the ropes that held her to the chair. Dominique ran forward
and tried to prise the cloth that gagged her from across her mouth but without
effect, it had been tied too tightly. He turned his attention to the blindfold
and wrenched it off. Berthe Morisot
blinked in the light with relief at the sight of her rescuers. Pieter pulled a
small folding knife from his pocket and managed to saw through the cloth. As he
pulled that clear he saw that another cloth had been tied tightly between her
lips holding further packing deep inside her mouth. He cut that too and pulled
the packing clear as Dominique fumbled with the ropes. Berthe
coughed and spluttered as the mouth filling wadding came clear. 

&nbsp;

�Oh, thank you,� Berthe gasped as Pieter removed the last of the gag.
�They�ve taken the girls. I couldn�t stop them.� Dominique had managed to untie
the ropes around her waist and across her lap and now started on her wrists. Berthe gave a groan as the ropes came loose. She pulled her
arms free and tried to massage some life back into her red raw wrists. 

&nbsp;

�Tell me what
happened,� said Pieter.� 

&nbsp;

�There were three
of them,� Berthe began. �Masked, carrying guns. They
burst in and made us all stand with our hands up. They wouldn�t let poor Janine
dress. They forced Francesca to tie me up on this chair and then Janine. Then
they tied up Francesca too. They gagged all of us and then they blindfolded me.
After that I could only tell what happened by what I heard.�

&nbsp;

�It must have been
terrifying,� said Breughel sympathetically, �please go on.�� 

&nbsp;

�Well one of them
said he thought there was only supposed to be one and one of the others said
they might as well take them both. There would be enough room in the truck, he
said. The girls were making a lot of noise in spite of their gags. I think the
men were pawing at them. They seemed to be waiting for something or someone.
They took quite a long time. Then there was another voice. A
woman�s voice. She was speaking in English but she was French, I am
almost certain. She sounded angry. Said that there should
only have been one of them and that one of them wasn�t really a model.
One of the men argued back saying what did it matter.
In the end the woman calmed down and they all left.�

&nbsp;

�What time was
this?�

&nbsp;

�Perhaps around six o�clock,� Berthe said.
She turned towards Dominique. �I am sorry Monsieur Ingres,�
she said. �I did what I could.�

&nbsp;

Dominic nodded. �I
am sure,� he said. �Please do not concern yourself. Herr Breughel here will do
all that needs to be done to obtain their safe return.�

6: A View Of the River Tiber

http://tinyurl.com/364vqa

Pieter was anxious to talk to Victorine Meurent once more. He
discovered she was in Rome, staying at one of the grand hotels on the Via Flaminia.
He took himself across town to meet her.

�Good afternoon, Mademoiselle Meurent,� Pieter was trying to be affable. �I hadn�t
expected to see you in Rome.�

�I go where my members� interests take me,
Mister Breughel,� Victorine replied.

�Of course. And where did they take you yesterday?�

�May I be permitted to know why you ask?

�Of course. I am enquiring into the disappearance of another model. At that time.�

�Ah, of course. Monsieur Ingre�s girls, I assume. I see.
Well, let me think. Yesterday, you say? I was here in Rome as it happens.
I had lunch with Signor Canale and Monsieur Claude
Lorraine Then I was shopping in the Via dei Condotti until perhaps 4 o�clock, Versace, Prada. You can ask them. After that I came back here to my
hotel. Signor Canale collected me from here at around
7 o�clock and we went to the Opera together. A performance of Mozart�s �Die Entf�hrung aus dem Serail� � rather appropriate
don�t you think?�

Pieter ignored her irony,
wondering about the excellent intelligence she obviously had about Janine�s
abduction. �And how about late that afternoon? Around
five to six o�clock?�

�Let me see,� said Victorine, �I�m sure that I should be more discreet about
my encounters but, since you ask, I was with Mr. Constable. An English artist,
you understand. He paints such delightful, bucolic scenes but has little call
for the services of my girls, I regret.� 

Pieter smiled
disingenuously. �And these gentlemen can vouch for your whereabouts? They will
remember your meetings with them?�

Victorine looked offended at the suggestion that anyone would fail to recall
an encounter with her. �I would felt I had failed if they did not,� she said.
�I have my personal reputation to take care of as well as concerning myself
with my members. Perhaps if we spent some more time together Mister Breughel,
you might discover why they would be unlikely to forget.� 

Breughel felt uncomfortable with her
flirting. �A delightful suggestion Mademoiselle but at present�� he shrugged
his shoulders. �You understand?�

It was clear that Victorine
didn�t but she tried to appear concerned. �Of course,� she said. �It must be
difficult for you. Mister Da V and
now Monsieur Ingres. No doubt they are both
anxious to continue their paintings.�

�I think they are also concerned for the
welfare of the girls,� Pieter asserted.

Victorine raised a perfectly sculpted eyebrow. �Perhaps,� she said. 

�One other thing,� Pieter began. �Do you
represent any girls in the United States?�

She looked puzzled for a moment. Pieter
couldn�t tell if it was affected or not. �No,� she said, eventually. �I have
had talks but it�s a very different place. So many amateurs! Little
room for professionals like ourselves. And the artists! All over the place. Not like here. Paris, London, Florence, Rome, Venice, Madrid, Amsterdam. Maybe ten cities and you have Europe covered. There the
artists seem to enjoy being as far as possible from one another. Who did I see?
Oh yes, O�Keefe. In the New
  Mexico desert for heaven�s
sake! How can an artist live like that? And what model would follow them? It�s
no wonder she paints rocks.�

�Did you see the TV show while you were out
there?�

�TV show?�

�It�s a sort of talent show - America�s
Next Top Model,� Pieter was watching Victorine�s face
closely. She shook her head. Pieter still couldn�t tell if she was lying or
not. That�s the problem with models, he thought, they spend so much time giving
face for the artists� you can�t see what
they are thinking for real. He let the remark hang in the air and waitred to see which of them would rush to fill the silence
first.

It was Victorine.

Her face remained impassive. �Oh yes,� she
said. �Now you mention it. They asked me if I could identify some European
girls that might be interested in travelling to the States to join the
programme. I passed their details to some of the girls and told them to make
their own contact if they wanted to. I couldn�t see any value in getting
involved.�

�Would that have included Donna Vellani, Mr Da V�s girl?�

�They don�t belong to the artists!� Victorine reacted with a prickly tone before composing
herself. �It may have done. I�m afraid I really don�t remember. It didn�t seem
very important to me at the time.�� 

�I can see that,� Pieter was trying to be
affable. He was sure that Meurent had more to reveal
and it was more likely that she would say something helpful if she was relaxed.
The conversation wound around the programme, US TV and the state of American
art for some time but Breughel could find nothing more of use. In the end,
frustrated in some ways but feeling he had made some progress, he took his
leave and headed back to his own hotel.

&nbsp;

7: The Bucintoro Returning to the Molo on Ascension Day

http://tinyurl.com/yd9e5u

Pieter thought about his conversation with Victorine. The more he did so, the more he felt sure that
she was involved. Possibly she was the woman involved in the abduction of
Janine and Francesca. There was little to be gained from trying to have her arrested,
though. Pieter couldn�t imagine that the Carabinierri
would get any more out of her than he had. �Besides, as Buonarotti
had said, the police had shown little interest in the affair. Pieter did,
however, have one thing to go on. He knew of Canale, Lorraine and Constable and he knew where to find the first two of them. That
afternoon he took a flight to Marco Polo airport. By early afternoon he was
standing outside St Mark�s in Venice. 

Giovanni Antonio Canale
was standing behind his easel in a gondola in the middle of the Grand Canal, cursing and waving
his fists as the wash of passing launches disturbed his painting by rocking his
own boat.

Being hailed by Breughel from the bank only
appeared to add to his irritation.

�Canaletto,�
Pieter called. �Mr Canaletto. I must talk with you.�

Giovanni looked upstream at the apparently
never ending flotilla of tourist barges heading towards where he was moored. It
was clear that his painting would continue to be disturbed for some time. He
wiped his hands on a cloth and signalled to his gondolier to make for the bank.
He clambered out and put his hand forward to Breughel,
evidently unclear as to who it was that had been calling him. 

�Breughel,� the Dutchman said, shaking Canaletto by the hand. 

Canaletto looked unimpressed. �I know your work,� he said. �It�s a cold
country, the Netherlands.�

�I�m looking for a model,� Breughel said.
�In fact I am looking for two.�

�I doubt I can help you,� Canaletto replied. �My art,� he gestured to his canvas,
�responds to the power of the place. The light on buildings
and the water. I have no need of models. There are sufficient passers by
to give my pictures the scale that they need. I do not think I can help you.�

�Mademoiselle Meurent,�
Breughel said. �You know her?� Pieter noticed that one of Canaletto�s
assistants seemed to react to the name as he continued to clear the artist�s
materials from the barge. 

Canaletto affected an air of disinterest. �We have met. She was in Rome last week. So
was I. We have mutual friends.�

�Lorraine? Constable?� Pieter asked.

�What of it?� Canaletto
responded.

Breughel shrugged. �I�m always interested
by people�s friends,� he said.

�They are landscape artists like myself. Victorine is more likely
to help you find your models. She has many on her books, I am sure there would
be some to suit.�

�Well, if you cannot help,� said Breughel
resignedly. 

Canaletto shrugged. �Good bye then,� he said and walked off following his
assistants out of the square. 

Breughel watched him leave and made his way
slowly back towards the hotel. There was a message waiting for him when he got
there. �Meet me in the Piazza
San Marco beside the Procuratie Nuove. Seven o�clock.�
it said. �There are things that you need to know.� Breughel asked the desk
clerk who had left it but a shrug of the shoulders was all that he got in
reply. Looking at his watch he saw that he had a little time before the
appointment. He grabbed his jacket and headed towards the hotel door. As he
reached it he saw that his old friend Vermeer had arrived. 

�Leave your bags,� Pieter said, taking him
by the arm. �We need to go meet someone.� The two men headed towards the Piazza
San Marco. As they turned into the square they could see a short man dressed in
a dark coat apparently waiting for them. Breughel recognised
him as one of Canaletto�s assistants. They hurried
across towards him.

As they reached him, he looked nervous.
�There are two of you,� he said. 

�Do not worry. I am Breughel,�
Pieter said. �This is an associate of mine. You can trust him.�

The man looked thoughtful and peered beyond
them, scanning the square anxiously. �There are no others?� he asked.

Brueghel shook his head. �No. What did you want to say? Can you help us find
any of the missing models? Miss Schenk? Or Miss Corone.�

It was the man�s turn to shake his head. �I
can say nothing about them. You just need to know you are dealing with
dangerous men.� He was looking furtively over his shoulder pushing past them as
he started to get away. He stopped and turned to face them, his back towards
Saint Mark�s �Go back to Rome, Dutchman. Listen to Benny. Go back to Rotterdam. That�s
what Benny�s telling you. Go back before something bad happens, before�.�

The man�s words were cut off by the crack
of a rifle shot. The first bullet hit the man in the back of his neck, pushing
him forward towards Breughel and Vermeer. The bullet
spat out through the man�s chest and slammed into the pavement, narrowly
missing Vermeer as it ricocheted away. Vermeer and Breughel
threw themselves to the side. As the man lay gasping on the ground a second
shot rang out. This time the bullet hit him squarely in the head, exploding his
skull with terrifying finality. 

Crowds were screaming, people cowering in
the shelter of the surrounding buildings. Spattered with gore from impact of
the second bullet, Breughel thought quickly. �The
Campanile,� he called to Vermeer, �the shots came from the tower.�

�Right,� said Jan,
diving towards the arcaded front of the Libreria Sansonvinia.

Breughel felt rooted to the spot. He knew that in moments the police would
be there. The man was obviously dead, killed before he could say anything of
use to the Dutchmen. Breughel quickly went through
the man�s pockets in an attempt to find any clue that might help them. All that
the man had was a wallet. Brueghel caught a glimpse
of a credit card with the name �B. Casey� on it. �I think that I had better
take that,� a voice came from behind him. He turned around to see a Carabinieri standing behind him.

�Of course,� said Breughel,
passing the wallet to the policeman and feeling pleased with himself that he
had managed to palm the small card that had been sticking out from it. He had
learned something from De La Tour after all.

Vermeer came
padding back across the square. �Missed him,� he said, frustrated and
disappointed. 

A man pushed his way through the gathering
crowd. �I�m a doctor,� he said. Looking down at the lifeless body spread on the
pavement, none of them needed medical qualifications to decide that his skills
would be of little use. Breughel and Vermeer spoke to
the policeman, giving him details of where they could be reached. The Carabinieri made a brief call on his radio and then nodded
to the two Dutchmen that they could go.

The two of them left the square and fell
into the first bar that they found. In the absence of Genever
the two of them ordered Grappa and gulped down the harsh liquor in an attempt
to ease the shock. �Did you see anything at all,� Pieter asked Jan.

�No,� said Vermeer, �nothing. There was
crowd leaving as I reached the door to the tower. All tourists by the look of
them but our man could have been with them. A pity that your
contact wasn�t more ready to talk.�

Pieter took another sip of Grappa. He
grunted and showed Vermeer the card he had pulled from the dead man�s wallet. 

�Il Giardinerra,�
Jan read. �The Garden?�

�Yes,� said Breughel.
�It looks like some sort of club. Perhaps we deserve an evening out.�

8: The Garden of Earthly Delights

http://tinyurl.com/3cdsj5

Breughel felt foolish. The elaborate mask he was wearing felt stiff and
uncomfortable on his face; the cloak awkward and heavy as it hung from his
shoulders. He looked across at Vermeer who was similarly dressed. Even behind
his own mask, he looked no more content than Breughel
was.

In a city renowned for its masked carnival
he felt that he should not feel out of place. Nevertheless, in spite of the
fact that all of the crowd milling around the doors of the building were masked
as well, he found the whole experience odd. 

A few discrete questions in their hotel had
prepared them for the venue and Breughel�s discovery
that it was run by one of his countrymen had made it easy to gain the promise
of entry. A thick set man in a dinner suit that made him look like an elegantly
attired gorilla was debating with Breughel whether
the pair of them would be allowed in. �Breughel?� the
bouncer said, peering at the list of names on his clip board. �How do you spell
that?�

�The regular way,� Pieter responded, taking a moments pleasure from the bouncer�s puzzled look.
�Hieronymus � Gerome invited us. He said there�d be
no trouble.�

�Don�t worry,� the bouncer responded,
making no move to let them through. �It�s no trouble to me.�

Vermeer leant forward and slipped a twenty
euro note into the man�s breast pocket. �Why don�t you give Mr Gerome a call?� The gorilla pulled the note from his
pocket, looked it for a moment and then put his head back inside. He reappeared
a moment later.

�Mr Gerome says
it�s OK,� he said, gesturing for them to come in. The two artists moved into
the lobby. Two women, naked from the waist up except for
their masks were emerging form the powder room. Another was being led on
a leash towards the main room It was just then that Gerome appeared. �Pieter, Jan,� he enthused. �Good to see
you! And so far from home.�

Pieter looked at the man from S�Hertogenbosch. He wondered what the other members of the
Brotherhood of Our Lady in Gerome�s home town would
make of this place.

�Come on through,� said Jerome. The main
room of the club was decorated like some outlandish green house. Enormous
artificial plants acted as pillars to hold up the ceiling. Green suede covered
couches were dotted around where the mainly male clientele sprawled, enjoying
drinks and the attentions of the club�s hostesses. All were masked,
all the women bare breasted, most of the men naked at the crotch.

�I hope you don�t mind our house rule,�
Jerome gestured to his own mask, an elaborate affair trimmed in gold and black
leather.

�Not at all,� Pieter responded. �We all
like to hide behind a mask at some time.� Jerome gestured to a couch. 

�Perhaps a drink?� he said. When Pieter
nodded, Jerome clapped his hands. A woman in a floor length velvet skirt, a
green velvet mask and nothing else appeared carrying a tray. 

�Yes, Mr Jerome,� she said, curtseying to
the three men.

�Champagne, please
my dear. And from my bin, please, not the usual pop.� The girl nodded,
curtseyed again and disappeared.

�This looks like a successful venture,�
Pieter looked around at the busy room. 

Jerome nodded. �Yes, it�s a bit different
from Aachen, though.�

Jan watched as one of the hostesses was
bent over a couch and her skirt was pushed up around her waist. The two men on
the couch seemed to be debating the finer qualities of her naked buttock. �Mind
you, I remember some of the Brabant Carnivals,� he said.

Their champagne appeared. As Jerome lifted
a glass as a toast, a violin started playing Spring
from Vivaldi�s Four Seasons. �Gentlemen, please
excuse me for a moment,� he said. �The show is about to start, I should make
sure�.�

�Please,� said Pieter, considerately, raising his glass. As Jerome left them, Pieter turned back
to Jan Vermeer. �It takes some nerve,� he said �to turn one of your paintings
into a night club.�

The girl returned to re-fill their glasses
and curled up on the couch beside the two men. �You have a nice time here?� she
said, smiling. �Mr Jerome likes you to have a nice time. I can do that for
you.� 

Pieter turned to the girl. �We have a nice
time sure. You work here long?�

�Not so long. Maybe three weeks, I�m not
sure.� Pieter could see she was out of her head on something. He didn�t think
it was likely to be the wine.

�You know a girl called Victorine?�
he said. 

�Sure,� the waitress replied. �She got me
this job. She�s been a good friend to me. Helped set me up in Venice, found me a
place, found me this. I�m just doing this between
modelling jobs. She�s OK.�

�Yes,� said Breughel,
�I�m sure she is.�

As the music got louder, Vivaldi�s intricate melodies gave way to a more urgent,
driving beat and the lights in the club dimmed apart from a spotlight on a
small stage at the front of the room, farthest from the bar. The waitress
slipped away. Dark green curtains parted to reveal a backdrop painted as a
replica of the centre panel of Jerome�s most famous work, The Garden of Earthly
Delights. Two women, clad only in green leggings but with ostentatiously died
orange hair and sporting large artificial phalluses, appeared from either side
of the stage and drew aside a panel in the backdrop exposing a large cage that
appeared to be crammed with naked, chained, women.

A round of applause went up from the
audience.����� 

The display began. The helpless women were
led from the cage in turn by the two women in green leggings and lined up
across the front of the stage for the audience�s inspection. The arrival of
each was greeted with more applause, whistles and cat calls. None of the
captives looked concerned by the behaviour of the audience; rather as the
audience became more raucous, so those on display became more aroused. Each was
brought forward in turn to engage in some tableaux of deviant sexual behaviour;
the first sucking enthusiastically on the phallus of one of the women that had
brought her from her cage; the second bending to take the phallus of the other
woman in her arse, the third and fourth encourage to engage in a round of
helpless 69, their wrists shackled behind their backs but their mouths well
able to pleasure the other. 

The women in green leggings began to invite
members of the audience to join them on the stage, some came up to take over in
the use and abuse of the helpless girls, others brought their own captives in
tow to be displayed to the rest of the club and to be put to the phallus or
forced into oral sex play. 

Breughel looked around at the others in the room. All were deeply absorbed,
either in the display on the stage before them or with whosoever was with them
on their couches. Even Vermeer was staring at the display of debauchery. Pieter
nudged him and nodded towards the door that Jerome had gone through. The two of
them left their couch and edged their way across the darkened room towards the
door. It led to a corridor that wound its way down into the bowels of the
building. There was no sign of Jerome or of anyone else for that matter. The
sound of the music from the stage still throbbed through the structure of the
building. Pieter and Jan searched through the rooms off of the corridor.

Pieter called to get Jan�s attention.
�Vermeer,� he said. �Over here.�

Jan joined Breughel
in what was evidently the dressing room� - or perhaps undressing room � used by
the girls before they went on stage. Clothes were strewn around the room but Breughel picked up an orange silk skirt. �Look at this,� he
said. �Francesca was wearing this in the painting that Ingres
was doing of her and Janine.� He rummaged in the pile again and pulled out a
grey silk gown with a gold lining. �And Janine, she was laying on this. They
must have been here or someone who has seen them since their abduction must
have been here.�

Vermeer studied the clothes. �Well, they
weren�t on stage.�

�No,� said Pieter, �but maybe they were
going to be. Follow me.� He dropped the pile of clothes and headed out of the
room and off down the corridor. At the far end was a door, wedged ajar with a
brick. He stopped and listened intently before opening it. 

Pieter and Jan found themselves on a small
platform jutting out over the canal that ran behind the club. Barges and
launches were puttering by. One gondola, its occupant peering up at the
buildings on either side as their gondolier drove the boat forward, slid by
barely an arm�s length from the platform. 

Breughel felt certain that the girls had been in the club and that, after
his arrival with Vermeer, they had been taken away by boat. Now they could be
anywhere though, lost in the maze of waterways that threaded through the city
and led out to the Lagoon.

Pieter and Jan made their way back to the
bar. The show was still continuing, a tangled heap of naked interwoven limbs
like some manic version of Twister in the centre of the stage. Breughel and Vermeer waved for some more champagne. This
time it was the low quality wine that the punters usually received. Jan and
Pieter sank a glass each but without enthusiasm. It was only as the pile of
bodies on the stage began to subside that Jerome reappeared.

�Gentlemen,� he beamed, �my apologies. Business. You know how things are. So many responsibilities
in a place like this. Did you enjoy the show? I could find you a girl or two if
you like.�

Pieter shook his head. �No need, Jerry,� he
said. �My last woman ran out on me. I�m still getting over her. Girl called
Janine. You come across her?�

Jerome�s face gave no flicker of
recognising the name. He shook his head. �We get a lot of girls through here.
They don�t always use their own names.�

�Do they all come willingly?�

�Sure, Piet, what
sort of place do you think this is? There�s no shortage of girls to play these
games. I don�t have to put a squeeze on anyone to play here.�

Breughel shrugged and got to his feet. �I�d better be going,� he said. Jan
looked puzzled but joined his colleague. �Oh, by the way.
Do you know Benny Casey?�������������� 

This time it was clear from Jerome�s
reaction that he did. �Sure,� he said, �short guy, dark curly hair,� Breughel nodded in response. �He comes in here sometimes.
He�s done some odd jobs for me. How do you know him?�

�We were talking, earlier on today?�

�Uh huh,� said Jerome, �how was he?�

�Not great,� Breughel
replied. Jerome looked puzzled. �Last I saw of him, he had the top of his skull
blown off by a rifle shell. He wasn�t looking great at all.� The blood drained
from Jerome�s face but he said nothing. �Good night, Jerry,� Breughel said, tapping Jan on the shoulder to get his attention
away from the last of the stage performance. �Look after yourself.� Breughel led the way out of the club.� 

9: The First Venice Set

http://www.tfaoi.com/mn/mib/mib108.jpg

No sooner had they left the club, than
Pieter had urged Jan across the square and down to the canal. The square was
filled with masked revellers and no one stopped them as they climbed down into
a motor launch that was sitting conveniently by a jetty. Jan cast off as Breughel started the engine and steered the boat out into
the canal. He motored up to the next junction turning into another canal that
he thought would bring them around behind the club. As he turned once more he
caught sight of the platform that he and Jan had been standing on not long
before. He steered the boat in behind a moored barge and the two men sat down
to wait. 

Some ten minutes later another launch
appeared in the canal and stopped alongside the platform. A figure appeared
from inside the club and stood on the platform apparently arguing with whoever
was in the boat. The man on the platform pulled out a cigarette. In the flare
of the match that he used to light it, Pieter could see that it was Jerome. He
flicked the match into the canal and leapt onto the boat. It took off along the
canal, passing only a few feet from where Breughel�s
boat was concealed.

Breughel watched them motor away, letting them get well clear of the barge
before pulling out to follow them. He wished Van Soest
was with them � he could do with someone who knew more about boats than he or
Vermeer did � the canals were much the same as Amsterdam�s but the
Lagoon was another matter. They managed to keep the launch in sight as it made
it way through the warren of the city�s canals and out into the Lagoon. There
was sufficient traffic on the water for Breughel to
keep himself hidden from the boat that he was following but he and Vermeer
watched as it drew up behind a large motor yacht. Jerome jumped off of the
launch onto the yacht�s bathing platform and climbed aboard. From where they
were Breughel could see three or four men moving
around on the deck of the boat, one scanning the lagoon with powerful
binoculars. He couldn�t see any opportunity to approach the yacht so they
cruised by trying to see what they could without attracting attention.

They motored on down the Lido until Breughel
found a pier where they could moor up and disembark. �What did you think?� he
said to Vermeer.

�Nothing suspicious on the face of it,� he
replied. �Sure, the guys on deck looked like they could handle themselves but
there�s no law against that.� The two men were strolling back towards where the
yacht had been moored. �The boat�s name was Metamorphosis IV, out of Naples. It looked
comfortable, and fast. Whoever owns it or chartered it has obviously got money.
There was an artist�s easel on the foredeck.� 

�Very good,� said Breughel.
They turned a corner towards the yacht mooring. �Ah, I was afraid of that,�
Pieter said watching as the boat left the pier. �They have been quick off the
mark. Let us hope young Miss Schenk is quite well.�

�You think that she is on board?�

�Almost certainly. And I think I know where that boat is probably going. We need to
get the team together again, Jan, and we�re going to be careful this time. We
have the advantage that our quarry almost certainly thinks he has given us the
slip. I don�t want him slipping away like the one in London.�

Vermeer nodded grimly. They hadn�t been
quick enough then, three of the opposite side had ended up getting killed and
the man they had been after had almost got away with it.

The two men took a water taxi back to the Molo and headed off to the hotel.

Jan spent the rest of the following morning
pounding the telephone, trying to make contact with the team that Pieter liked
to work with on these occasions.

Pieter did little apart from thumbing
through catalogues of recent art exhibitions. 

Jan had finished his work when the phone
rang again. Pieter picked it up. �Breughel?� the
voice on the other end of the line said. �This is Inspector Vassari
of the Venice Carabinnierri. I thought you might like
to know that we just pulled a body out of the Lagoon. One of your countrymen,
name of Jerome van Aachen, sometimes calls himself
Jerome van den Bosch or Hieronymous. Did you know
him?�

�I met him,� said Pieter. �Why?�

�Thought you might like to explain how he
came to be swimming in his suit. Plus, looking at what�s left of his face, we
wondered if you might know why someone in a big boat decided to run him over.�

�I really couldn�t say, Inspector,� Breughel replied, evenly. �I last saw him yesterday evening
just after he�d left his club � Il Giardinierra. I
had no idea he was aquatically minded, but I guess if you don�t like water, you
don�t come to Venice.�

Vermeer listened to the conversation,
amused by Breughel�s responses but concerned by the
evident ruthlessness of their foe. By the time Breughel
had finished with the Inspector, Jan was able to let him know how the team was
shaping up. Frans Hals and
Pieter de Hooch were both coming down and Vermeer had also managed to find Jan Steyning, whose nautical background would come in handy.
He�d also enlisted the help of Caravaggio. His local knowledge would be
invaluable. �So what next?� said Vermeer. 

�The Bay of Naples,� said
Pieter. �Get the team to check out all the yacht harbours between Naples and Salerno. My money�s
on Amalfi but I guess Positano
is a possibility or even Stabiae. I want to know
where that boat is.� 

10 : Relativity

http://britton.disted.camosun.bc.ca/escher/relativity.jpg

Pieter Breughel,
Jan Vermeer, Caravaggio and Frans Hals
were sitting outside a caf� in the small seaside town of Maiori. The four of them were each enjoying the warmth of the late morning
and the sharp caffeine boost from a large espresso coffee.

�Well done for finding the boat, Frans,� Pieter said. Hals
shrugged. He knew it had been a matter of luck. Any of them could have picked
it up. �And Caravaggio, my friend, what have you been able to find? You know
the men in these ports. What is being said about the splendid yacht,
�Metamorphosis IV� in the bars?�

�Too much money for their
own good. People think it�s maybe a Mafiosi boat
but nobody can point a finger at any particular family. The boat put in four
nights ago, late. There were trucks waiting at the marina when it came in.
That�s unusual, people expect a limo, a Diablo maybe for the owner of a boat
like that but no -�
three small, plain, white, trucks.�

�You�re sure about that? Three
small trucks? Not one big one?�

Caravaggio nodded. �People were sure about
that. Heavies off the yacht made sure no one was close enough to see what went
on or came off but come the morning the trucks were gone and the boat has sat
in the harbour for the last three days with nothing going on.�

Pieter looked thoughtful. The next bit was
going to be dangerous for all of them and for Janine too, if she was where
Pieter thought that she was. Pieter turned to Caravaggio. �I need to find their
place. It�s going to be somewhere around here. He pointed to the neck of land
between Amalfi and Sorrento. �In fact
my money�s on Ravello. Check out the large villas.
Folk up there may not have noticed new comers � there�s a lot of tourists and a
lot of artists too � but that�s what we need. Trucks coming and going may have
been noticed � the roads are narrow and the last thing the good burghers of Ravello will enjoy will be more traffic.�

�Its OK,� said Caravaggio, �I�ll find it.� Breughel had his reservations. The man was notoriously
unreliable but he knew the coast and the men in the ports and he was tough too;
a good man to have on your side in a fight. Pieter didn�t usually like working
with artists from outside the low countries but he was
prepared to make an exception here. 

A day later, Caravaggio had done his work.
They�d found the house Breughel was looking for. The
Villa Rafalla on the edge of Ravello,
was perched high on the ridge with stunning views of the Bay of Salerno. It
was cut off on three sides by steep escarpments.

The team mounted their assault mission that
evening. 

Pieter crouched down in the shadows. He was
happy for the team to take on the first part of the operation. They trained for
stuff like this. He�d managed to make his way through the maze of stairs and
passages that made up the centre of Ravello into the
far end of the Villa�s ornate gardens where he was crouching in the shadow of
one of the poplar trees that lined the edge of the cliff. Between Pieter and
the villa itself was the flood lit patio and the villa�s swimming pool. There
was no way that he could get beyond the lights without being seen and no way
that the others could get into the villa either. Fortunately Jan Vermeer was
expecting to take care of that. Pieter scanned the stone balustrade at the edge
of the patio through his night vision goggles. He caught sight of Jan crouched
behind it, busily fitting the cables that would allow the others to climb up
the steep escarpment. The suddenly Jan froze, motionless in the dark, evidently
startled by something.

Pieter swung his glasses around. Victorine Meurent had emerged
from the villa. Wearing a stunning, one piece, white, swimsuit
and carrying a towel she was evidently heading to the pool. One of the heavies
that Pieter had seen on the boat appeared at the door behind her. The two
exchanged words in an argument played out with emphatic gesticulation. Victorine seemed irritated by the guard�s interference, the guard appeared to be concerned about her
using the pool at night. Victorine�s view prevailed.
The guard shrugged and went back inside.

Breughel could sense Jan�s impatience but he knew that nothing could be done
while Victorine was in the pool. She dived in and
made a few lengths of the pool. Satisfied that she had made her point she
climbed out and headed for the shower post not far from the patio�s balustrade.
Knowing how Jan liked to work, Pieter wasn�t surprised by what happened next.
As Victorine showered under the stream of fresh
water, hands reached out from the shadows, grabbing her and dragging her,
silently, into the dark. Moments passed. Pieter continued looking through his
binoculars and saw Victorine�s towel pulled away from
beside the shower, disappearing into the darkness as she had. Now he thought
the team would make their move.

Within seconds the lights around the patio
and the pool went out. Through his glasses Pieter could see the distinctive
glow of infra-red lamps as well but within moments they were extinguished too.
From inside the villa came the distinctive thump of stun grenades detonating.
There was a short exchange of gunfire, the rattle of a
semi-automatic weapon followed by the crump of what Pieter knew would be a gas
grenade. Then it was over. Pieter saw Jan emerge from the villa and wave to
him, beckoning him forward.

Breughel made his way across the garden and into the villa. �All secure,
boss,� said Jan as Pieter crossed the threshold. �The lads are through there.�
He pointed towards the front of the building. In the next
room. Frans Hals,
Jan Steyning, Caravaggio and Pieter de Hooch were
standing guard over four men that sat on the floor, their wrists cable-tied
behind them.

Pieter recognised the first of them
immediately, �Hello, Herr Escher,� he said. The man scowled up at him, through
eyes streaming from the effects of the gas. The other three men, evidently
Escher�s paid muscle, looked no happier.

Jan returned to the room, pushing a
helpless, struggling Victorine. With her hands tied
behind her, strips of tape strapped across her mouth, and her white costume
streaked with mud and grass stains, it was obvious that she had been left
helpless in the garden after being snatched from her shower. Jan motioned to Steyning and De Hooch to keep guard of their captives. He
turned to Brueghel. �We�d better check the cellars,�
he said. Caravaggio led the way along a corridor and down through the slowly
dispersing smoke and dust of the assault and down an endless series of flights
of stone steps leading into the basement of the villa.���� 

The cellars of the villa held what they
were looking for. On either side of a central corridor were a dozen brick
arched recesses, the semi circular fronts closed by steel bars. In each of the
recesses two or three girls sat, chained by their wrists, ankles or necks to
heavy iron rings set into the back wall of their cells. �Please,� the two girls
in the first cell called out when they saw Breughel
and the others, �Please help us.�

Breughel made his way along the line of cells, to his relief Janine was
sitting in the third cell along with Francesca, the girl she had been captured
with. Janine was naked, Francesca wore the remnants of the costume she had been
wearing when the two had been taken, both wore ball
gags but still showed their relief at the appearance of their rescuers. Breughel pushed through to the end of the cellar. There on
a row of hooks he found a set of keys. He tossed them to Jan who set to
releasing the women. Breughel went on examining the
cellar, taking in the whips hanging from brackets at one end, the soiled,
stained mattress that he imagined had seen many rapes of the women by which
ever guard was on duty. He looked at the array of chains, shackles, gags, and
clamps all of which testified to the brutality of the conditions in which the
women had been kept. He turned to Jan Vermeer. �You�d better call the police,�
he said. The team went from cell to cell freeing the women from their chains
and comforting them as best they could.

Later, Janine Schenk, wrapped in a blanket
and with the sores from her shackles on her wrists and ankles bandaged, was
sitting on the terrace of the Villa Rufalla as she
and Breughel watched the flashing blue lights wind
their way up the narrow road from Amalfi. �Are you
all right?� Breughel said.

Janine nodded. �Yes,� she said. �Though I did wonder for a while if I would be. Victorine recognised me at the pick up. She must have know
that you�d come after me. That�s why they were shutting things down. They had
been using the Giardinera as a sort of auction house
for the girls. After you turned up they decided to move us on.�

�With fatal consequences
for Jerome.�

�I didn�t know. He was always OK with the
girls. At least the guards there didn�t rape us. How did you find us?�

�I saw the yacht � �Metamorphosis IV� � in Venice. I knew
who�d painted Metamorphosis I to III and I knew where he got the ideas for some
of his pictures. The more I thought about it the more it seemed like this was a
likely spot. Then Frans found the yacht.�

�Crazy,� said Janine, �all that trouble,
all that risk. And it�s not like they were making much money from the auctions.
Jerome reckoned he made more from his club. I heard them arguing.�

�This wasn�t about the money, Janine,�
Pieter said, just as the first police car pulled up in front of the villa.
Janine looked puzzled.

A carabinierri
got out, closely followed by Inspector Vassari. He
touched his hat to Pieter. �Breughel,� he said. �this looks like a mess.�

�Inspector,� Pieter nodded back in
acknowledgement. �You�re a bit off your patch.�

�Some friends of the Chief of Police
thought I should wander over this way.�

�Mr da
V?�

�The Chief didn�t tell me,� Vassari shrugged. �What�s the score?�

�Plenty of plus points for your lads,�
Pieter said to the Inspector. �There�s a boat in the harbour at Maiori that should have enough forensic evidence on board
to tie it to Jerome�s murder. If you�re lucky you might find the rifle that
killed Benny Casey. Inside here you�ll find Maurits
Cornelius Escher who�s responsible for all this together with a rather foul mouthed
young lady called Victorine Meurent
who�s been his main accomplice. You can start with trafficking women,
abduction, false imprisonment and sexual assault. Miss Schenk here can testify
to that.� Janine nodded. �The real deal may be a bit more difficult though.�

�The real deal?� the Inspector asked.

�Yes,� said Breughel.
�Give me a few days and there will be a few more people you�ll need to talk to.
Try to keep a lid on all of this. It would help a lot if nobody new about it
for a while.�

Vasari, nodded. �OK, Breughel,� he said. �I�ll do what I can.�

The following morning Breughel
and the team met up again in the villa. 

�The next bit is more of a challenge,� said
Pieter to the assembled team.

�I don�t understand,� Jan cut in. �We got
Escher. He was the man behind it. Victorine set the
girls up and Escher�s team snatched them. Jerome ran the auctions. What else is
there?�

�The real reason for all this,� said Breughel. �Sure the police will put the squeeze on Escher
but he won�t incriminate the others. If we want to wrap this up we�re going to
have to go after the rest of them.�

�The rest?�

�Yes. There�s at
least three more artists involved in this, if I am right. Maybe
more. Either way I want to make sure about things.�

�Who are we looking for?�

�Constable, Canaletto, Lorraine. They all gave Victorine
alibis for the abductions. Maybe they�re just her dupes but I don�t think so.�

�And what�s the angle?�

�We need to get in front of them somehow.
Get them to incriminate themselves, admit their involvement in the abductions.�

�Maybe you could offer them another girl?�
Janine said.

�What?�

�Tell them you can get hold of another
model. Somebody working on some important picture. All the time they had us they were saying things about how keeping
us caged would screw up Mr Da V, Buonarotti,
Dominique and the rest. They�d go for that. Set it up so they think
Escher suggested you contact them. If they take the bait, you�ve got them.�

�And who were you thinking of for bait?� Breughel was afraid that he already knew the answer.

�Me,� said Janine with disarming
simplicity.

�Janine, it�s too dangerous,� Breughel responded. 

�No, not how I see it. Those guys don�t
know me and I�m pretty sure they weren�t around at the club or when we got to Ravello. Caravaggio here would front it. They know he�d
have an inside track and he�s got a reputation as working on the seamier side
of things. He�d go in with me. He can handle himself. None of the three guys
you are talking about are up for much physical violence, as far as I can see. I
wear some sort of wire. Caravaggio gets them talking and there you are.�

Breughel looked sceptical. I�m not happy with this, Janine,� he said. �These
men are ruthless.�

�Maybe but maybe not. Maybe Escher was the muscle. I don�t have any of the guys you talked
of down for getting their hands dirty. Sure they could be the brains but I
think they�ll find it difficult to cope with the real world stuff.� 

�It sounds like too many �maybes� to me,
Janine.�

�She could be right, boss,� chipped in
Vermeer. �From what you�ve said we need to get an angle and this could be a
good one.�

�What do you think, Caravaggio?� Breughel asked.

�I don�t know the Englishman,� he said. 

�He�s put on a lot of weight the last few
years,� contributed Steyning.

Caravaggio continued �Canaletto
is a bright man but he�s no fighter. Lorraine, well, maybe. If
we could set something up, I�d be happy to sit in front of them. Do we know
where they are?�

Breughel nodded warily. �Yes,� he said. �I�ve been checking that out.
They�re in New York. They�re the panel of judges for the final of �America�s
Next Top Model�. The final programme goes out at the end of the week.�

�Sounds like we need a trip across the
pond,� said Hals.

Breughel looked glum. �Do you know how cold it is in New York right
now?� he said. �I only took on this job to get some sunshine.�

Janine grinned. �Well, you did tell Leo
you�d try to get his model back. I�m guessing that Donna Vellani
is still in the running.�

Breughel nodded slowly. �All right,� he said reluctantly, �but we�d better
have a good game plan.�

11 : Nighthawks

http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Nighthawks.jpg

It was so cold. Breughel
was walking down one side of the street, his hat pulled down, his collar up to
protect him from the wind. This hadn�t been the idea at all when he�d agreed to
take on this case. Why couldn�t they be back in Rome? 

Across the street, in the bar, Caravaggio
was sitting at the counter, staring into a glass of beer, waiting for his
meeting. Around the corner in the back of a van, three of the others were
monitoring the audio and video surveillance equipment. Breughel
watched as Canaletto walked down the street and into
the bar. Breughel walked on to the van. He pulled the
door shut behind him. It wasn�t much warmer inside the van than outside.

Vermeer passed him a pair of headphones. As
he got them in place he could hear Caravaggio�s voice. �I was told you were
interested in buying some of things I can get my hands on. Maurits
said I should contact you.� Breughel looked at the TV
screen. There was a flickering black and white picture being transmitted from
Caravaggio�s hidden camera.

�How is he? I haven�t heard from him for a
few days.�

�Enjoying the Villa Rufalla,
last time I saw him. Very good cellar he has there.�

�Yes, so I hear. Apparently you have a
contribution of your own to make.�

�Yes, I can get my hands on a case you
might be interested in.�

�Why here, why not talk to Maurits? Why not Ravello?�

�This is a New World vintage. I�ve no way
to ship it.�

�We�ve not really been very interested over
here before. Apart from some imports.�

�So I heard. How is the show going?�

Canaletto almost choked on his drink. He dropped his voice. �Be careful he
said, for heaven�s sake. We might be overheard.�

�Come on,� Caravaggio hissed, �I know about
Donna Vellani even if Maurits
doesn�t. OK so you�ve got a little scam of your own on the side. Hey, I�m cool
with that. How you square your boss is fine with me.�

�He�s not my boss, it�s more
.. well..�

From Canaletto�s
tone it was evident that, while Escher might have been brought in by him, Lorraine and
Constable, he was afraid of the man.

�So do you want me to pick up the case?�

Canaletto looked around over his shoulder, evidently nervous. He turned back
to Caravaggio and nodded. �Yes,� he said. �Sure. How much?�

�You decide. I�ll take the risk. I know
what the price on the stuff in Ravello was. I�ll show
you the case, if you�re happy, you pay me the same. If you�re not I�ll return
it.�

�The value depends on where the case is
from, you know.� Breughel was happy. That was exactly
the reaction he had expected. He was glad he�d insisted on Frans
working up the portrait.

�Sure,� said Caravaggio, �that�s what Maurits said. �I�ve got the work in progress. It�s a good
likeness maybe three quarters finished.�
If you�re happy with the picture and the case you pay me. If you�re not
happy I put them back. My risk. Can you make the
decision? Only Maurits said that the others might want
a say.�

�I make the decisions,� Canaletto
said. �What I say goes with Lorraine and Constable.�

�Sure,� said Caravaggio, �only I won�t have
time to set up another tasting if they suddenly decide it�s a case that they
are interested in. Just as long as you�re confident.� Breughel could see that Canaletto
looked uncomfortable. Caravaggio was good, there was no doubt.

Canaletto downed his beer. �OK,� he said. �I�ll get the three of us there.� Result, thought Pieter. Canaletto
seemed satisfied. �Can we do this before the show tomorrow night?� he said.

�Yes,� said Caravaggio. �There�s a car park
on 10th and West 34th, just near the Lincoln Tunnel.
You�ll need a van to take delivery. I�ll take cash. Eight o�clock.� 

Canaletto nodded. �OK,� he said, �we�ll be there.� He got up and left. Breughel breathed a sigh of relief.

They got ready for the exchange. Breughel was still unhappy about the role that Janine was
going to take as bait but she was insistent. She tried to placate Breughel. �Pieter, don�t worry. The boys will all be there
and I�m going to put on a bit of a disguise in case any of Canaletto�s
people have seen me before. Look.� She held out a long dark wig and then pulled
it on over her own mousey hair. Breughel had to admit
it was transforming but he still didn�t feel happy and his concerns grew as the
team taped up her wrists and ankles and carried her into the back of their
truck. �Come on, Pieter, I�m supposed to be Caravaggio�s hostage model. I can
hardly walk up and shake Canaletto by the hand and say,
good evening, can I?�

Breughel still wasn�t comfortable. It just seemed like there were too many
things that could go wrong. Now Caravaggio was putting
Janine�s gag on, stuffing her mouth with a wad of cloth and taping it over.
She gave an experimental grunt and then a stifled moan to show that the gag was
working. They put her in the back of the truck. She rolled herself from side to
side, struggling as she would have done in reality. Her pale cream skirt was
soon streaked with grease and mud from the floor of the van. She�d got a smudge
of dirt across her face and she�d managed to ladder her tights as well. Pieter
admired her attention to detail but then, he thought, what else do you expect from a super-realist! 

They headed off to the rendezvous. 

Breughel made his own way separately. He couldn�t
afford to be seen arriving with the others.

Canaletto was in the van checking out the helpless Janine. He seemed to be
making the most of it. Caravaggio was finding it hard to control his anger at
the way the Venetian was pushing her clothes around. Janine was squealing
authentically in protest. Canaletto saw the look
Caravaggio was giving him. �Hey,� he said, �I�m paying for this. I just want to
check the goods.� Lorraine was standing with the money looking bored. 

Constable was looking at the portrait
propped beside the van in which Janine was sitting. �I thought you said this
wasn�t finished yet,� he called out. 

�Yeah, sure,� said Caravaggio. �It�s nearly
done but it�s not complete yet.�

�How come the artist signed it then?�

�Fuck,� thought Pieter, Janine and
Caravaggio simultaneously.

�And who is this guy �Hals�
anyway?� Constable went on. 

In one swift movement, Canaletto
dragged Janine to her feet and had a pistol against her head. �Oh dear, oh
dear, oh dear,� he said. �I fear our friends here have not been entirely honest
with us. Mr Hals is an excellent painter. A splendid
portraitist but there is one important reason why the presence of one of his
works here gives me concern. He�s a close associate of Breughel.
And I fear Mr Breughel may not entirely approve of
our little enterprise.�

�Damn,� spat Constable, tossing the picture
to one side. Breughel was silently cursing the vanity
of Frans Hals. Imagine
signing it!

Caravaggio was watching the scene closely.
Things were getting sticky but at least no more guns had made their appearance.
There was no sign that Constable or Claude Lorraine were
armed. Canaletto pushed Janine towards the tailgate
of the truck. �She�s coming with us,� he barked, brandishing the gun. �Back off
you others.� He pointed the gun at Caravaggio and Vermeer. 

As they got out of the truck, Canaletto snarled at Janine, �Stupid bitch, you�re going to
suffer for this.� He grabbed her by the hair, intending to drag her towards his
own van. The wig came off in his hand. Janine seizing the opportunity presented
by Canaletto�s confusion,
hurled herself to the floor and rolled under the truck. She kicked herself
along on the ground struggling to get clear.

In the same instant, Caravaggio jumped, slamming
Canaletto�s gun hand against the truck. The pistol
fell from his grasp. Canaletto tried to dive after it
but as his head came down Caravaggio�s kick caught him in the ribs. He doubled
up in pain. Caravaggio hauled him around, pushing him against one of the
truck�s wheels. Canaletto looked as if he wanted to
make another move. Caravaggio slammed his forearm against Canaletto�s
throat, pulled his knife and pushed the point of it up against the Venetian�s
chin by way of discouragement. �You're
a big man, but you're in bad shape,� he said, quoting one of his
favourite movies. �With me it's a full time job. Now behave yourself,� 

Vermeer had his own gun out now and
advanced on Constable and Lorraine. The two men surrendered, raising their hands. Breughel
emerged from the shadows and ran to Janine�s side, dragging her from under the
truck. He pulled her up and sliced through the tape that bound her wrists. She
eased the tape from her lips and pulled out of her mouth the wad of cloth that
they had used to gag her.� �I told you
the wig was a good idea,� she smiled, coughing and working her lips. �Now are
you going to explain this? Why was Canaletto so
concerned to see a picture anyway?�

Breughel looked around at his assembled team. �Well, he said, �let�s ask Mr Canaletto here if I�ve got things right. Canaletto, Lorraine, Constable, Escher; what do they all have in common? Landscape painters. Me too for that matter but never mind
that. Sure we�ve all done a few portraits but landscape is what we are really
about. Only problem is it�s not so popular with the punters. It�s hard to make
a living. You end up having to do all sorts of stuff to make a crust.�

�Like solving crimes?� said Janine.

�Well, yes. But suppose the portrait
painters found their work disrupted? Suppose they couldn�t get models to work
for them? The clients couldn�t get their stuff; they�d have to buy landscapes
instead.�

�But that�s crazy,� said Vermeer. �It
wouldn�t work like that, would it?�

�No, I don�t think so,� said
Breughel, �but these guys didn�t think it through. This
whole thing was done to disrupt the portrait painters; prevent the painting of
people; force art into the outdoors; force artists to show the world around
them rather than painting their models. That�s why they had such little regard
for the girls � the appalling conditions at the Villa, the inhuman treatment on
the TV show here.�

�And Victorine? What was her motive? Surely she had everything to lose.�

�You might think that but she knew her time
was coming to an end. There�s not much work for an ageing model � I know
Rembrandt did that picture of his mother but that�s unusual. She was worried by
her fading looks, that her commissions would go and with that the reason why
the other girls came to her. She knew she needed something else. Trading flesh
for real was just the next logical step for her.�

�And what about �America�s Next Top Model�?� 

�I�m guessing that was Canaletto�s
idea. The aim was to set Donna up as their North American equivalent of Victorine. They needed a launch pad though. There�s was no way that they could produce anything like the scandal
of Manet�s Olympia portrait so
they thought they�d use TV. With the three of them as judges it wasn�t hard for
them to fix the outcome and with the fame from that they�d be well on their
way.�

12 : Vitruvian
Man

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Vitruvian.jpg

Pieter and Janine were sitting on the patio
of Mr Da V�s villa. Pieter was enjoying the warmth, a
considerable improvement over New
  York only days before. Leo
was sitting across the table from the two of them. Donna Vellani
had just emerged from Mr Da V�s pool and was wrapping
her long hair, turban style, in a towel. The sun sparkled on the drops of water
across her bare shoulders, the turquoise on her swimsuit, almost iridescent in
the bright light. She sat down on the floor beside Leo, reaching up to stroke
the old man�s thigh.

�I don�t know what they did to this young
lady,� Leo said, �but I can�t say I entirely
disapprove.�

il Salaino appeared with a tray of drinks,
peering with obvious disapproval at the way in which Donna was fondling
Leonardo.

Pieter didn�t feel entirely comfortable,
either. The girl had obviously been subjected to some form of conditioning that
exaggerated and promoted sexual arousal. But, as he�d said to Janine, all he�d
been asked to do was to get her back. He was just grateful they�d been able to
do it with the poor girl in one piece after seeing Escher�s psychopathic
tendencies.

il Salaino out Pieter�s drink down beside
him and turned to Leo. �The other young lady,� Salaino
managed to use the term as if it were one for the lowest form of animal life,
�is ready now.�

�Good,� said Leo, �you�d better bring her
up. I�d like my friends here to see what I am working on just now.�

Pieter raised an eyebrow. Leonardo was well
known to be secretive. It was most unusual for him to share anything about his
work. The young man left with a grunt.

�You see,� Leo continued turning to Janine
and Pieter, �one of the penalties of being a Renaissance man is that you are
expected to turn your hand to anything. Inspector Vassari,
he�s a clever man, he sees some of the things in Gerry�s club and he says, hey,
Leo, why don�t you see if you can improve on some of this? Help my boys out,
why don�t you? And I�m too soft hearted. So I say OK, Giorgio, I�ll see what I
can do. Still it�s an interesting problem.�

il Salaino guided Victorine
into the room. Pieter hadn�t expected that she would be pleased to see him and
he wasn�t disappointed as she favoured the entire room with a Medusa like
scowl. Leo�s �project� for Vassari appeared to be in
the area of personal restraints. Victorine was naked
but her body was locked into a metal frame. Metal bands at the forehead, neck,
waist, wrists, elbows, knees and ankles were linked by polished metal rods.
That passed though small ball shaped couplings on the bands.

�Mr Vassari has a
problem,� Leo said. �Too many prisoners, not enough cells.
With this you can use one large room for many prisoners. Each has their own
personal cell. Each of these connectors,� he reached for one of the ball shaped
couplings, can be set to allow a limited amount of travel for the rods or can
be locked to allow no movement at all. A few twists and the prisoner is able to
walk or is,� he snapped at the couplings on Victorine�s
wrists and ankles, �unable to move at all. For particularly
recalcitrant individuals - and I am afraid that Mademoiselle Meurent comes into that category � the head can be locked
in place as well.�

Victorine was struggling against the bands and rods with no effect.� 

�Leo, that�s positively medieval,� Pieter
said intending it as a remark of disapproval.

Leo took it as a compliment. �Thank you,�
he said. �I have used ideas from many sources.� He looked at his watch. �Still,
I must leave you. Vasari wished to see the prototype.
Please enjoy the villa for a few days. Il Salaino
will cater to your needs.� Donna was reaching up to Leo from the floor. He
smiled down at her. �No, my dear, you must stay here too. We will resume your
portrait when I return.� Leo reached out and twisted the connectors at Victorine�s hips, freeing them for movement. �Come along my
dear,� he said taking her by the arm. Victorine had
no choice but to follow, following with stiff legged steps. Donna watched him
go with tears in her eyes.

Pieter turned to Janine. �Well,� he said,
�you promised me some sunshine and warmth. I�m going to take advantage of Mr Da V�s hospitality. I think we�ve earned it.�

Janine smiled. �Yes,� she said, �but I�ve
got some work to do. I�m desperate to do a picture of that Lamborghini and now
my air brushes have turned up I can get started. The light on the chrome is
something to die for.�

�Well,� said Breughel,
grinning, �at least you don�t need a model for that.�
