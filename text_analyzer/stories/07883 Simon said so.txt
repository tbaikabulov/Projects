Synopsis:   She doesn't quite know how it happened but somehow she ended up on her knees in front of her boyfriend's brother.






WEDNESDAY

�So what did you make me for breakfast?�&nbsp; Simon, my boyfriend&#8217;s older brother who shared our apartment asked me. He snaked his hand underneath my arm and around my waist to get to the frying pan.&nbsp; A little too close as always. I mostly ignored him. But I have to say in the last six months after all us moving in together, nothing bonded me and Simon and I more than snarky banter. 
�Get off Simon. I don&#8217;t have time for this.� I upended the frying pan into the dish on the counter and rushed back into the bedroom to check if my hair straightner had warmed up. Camren, my boyfriend, was still in bed. We had been working opposite shifts which meant we hardly got to see each other.&nbsp; Whenever I complained about that within earshot of Simon, Simon always made it a point to say that if I just squinted a little bit I could pretend Simon was Camren. Which wasn&#8217;t entirely untrue. Besides certain strikingly different facial features, both were a little over 6&#8217;2, black, with these arms that you just wanted to do chin ups off of. Or of course, let yourself get swallowed into.&nbsp; But despite that, Camren was a serial monogamist and Simon, was in the Guinness Book of World Lechers.&nbsp; 

When I got home that evening around 5, Simon hadn&#8217;t come home yet and Camren had already left. I made dinner, ate and left some for Simon in the oven. Minutes after I went back into the bedroom I think I passed out because the next thing I knew it was 8 PM and I could hear the TV&#8217;s on.&nbsp; I doubted that he had the presence of mind to check the oven for food so I decided to go out and say hi. As soon as I walked out the door I could see the living room TV and on the screen was the worst kind of modern porn with people just going at each other and something gave me the feeling that Simon wasn&#8217;t just idly watching.&nbsp; I stepped back into my room unable to suppress a smile. After all how could I not do the whole snarky thing over this.&nbsp; I opened the door again and despite slight feelings of apprehension about walking in on him jerking off I got to a few feet behind the couch before I stopped. I half coughed before saying, �Simon, really it&#8217;s not like you don&#8217;t have a TV in your room. Do you really have to do that here?�
�The DVD player is broken,� Simon said rather simply without breaking attention from the screen. Not the response I was hoping for.&nbsp; I was hoping for more of a jumping out of his skin response. And plus being snarky just isn&#8217;t all that fun when he won&#8217;t play.
�Simon, seriously, ew, you can&#8217;t do that there. It&#8217;s more than a little gross.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Simon said nothing for a full minute, still jerking off.
�Simon&#8212;�
Still nothing but he turned down the volume of the DVD player.
�Do you really want me to stop jerking off?� he asked.
�I have no problem with you jerking off.&nbsp; I&#8217;m sure you have your&#8212;�
�Do you want me to stop jerking off?� he cut me off a little strongly.
�Yes,� I said starting to feel rather uncomfortable in this conversation.&nbsp; This was supposed to be �ha ha� funny.&nbsp; It didn&#8217;t seem to be heading in that direction.&nbsp; He just sounded like he was this odd sort of angry calm.
�Then come here,� he said.
�Excuse me?� 
�I&#8217;ll stop if you come here.�
�No.�
�I want to show you what you are missing out with little Camren with big Simon just a few feet away.�
�You are unbelievable.� I hesitated a little. That sounded more like him. Less serious. But I knew the only rational thing to do was&nbsp; to turn around, walk back in my room and complain to Camren later. But I hesitated for a few seconds too many. Before I could move towards my room I heard him get up. He almost never wore his shirt around the apartment and it wasn&#8217;t the first time I had seen him in his boxer briefs but there was something much more threatening about his face tonight. 
�Come here.� He said standing next to the couch.
The porno was still running in the background, but this time, I guess because his shorts were pulled up, this time I went. 
�Sit,� he said.
�I&#8217;m really not all that into porn&#8212;� I started before he cut me off.
�Sit.� He repeated a little more sternly. 
I sat.
He came and stood directly in front of me, trapping me in between himself and the couch, pushing against my knees, locking me into place. I could no longer see the porno but by the overly exaggerated sounds it was making I could involuntarily form a pretty good mental picture.
�Simon, you know,� I paused trying to think of something funny, witty, even antagonistic to say to break the weird vibe. But I couldn&#8217;t think. I could, however, smell him. He had been halfway through jerking off which was pretty obvious not just from the hard lump at my eye level but also from the smell of gathering precum and sweat. 
�Shh..,� he said, running his hand reassuringly down my face and squeezing my shoulders. I shivered a little at the lightness of his touch and tried to stop my body from inching into his hand as he ran it down my arm. He stood up tall. Or rather taller, arched his back looking up at the ceiling and then finally looked down at me again.&nbsp; I still hadn&#8217;t quite accepted my situation yet. He couldn&#8217;t be serious. Not that he had done anything yet. But hadn&#8217;t he? Any minute now he&#8217;d start cracking up and I&#8217;d feel like an idiot especially if I did something ridiculously dramatic like pushing him off me and jumping off the couch. And then he&#8217;d be able to tease me about it forever. 
But then I saw him reaching into his shorts and while looking straight at me he started rubbing himself. He slowly began to pull his cock out again.&nbsp; My eyes drifted down for a second on his cock and then glued themselves to the floor. He let me keep them there for a minute while threading his free hand through my hair and then suddenly jerked my hair by the fistful, pulling my face up.
�Look at me,� he stated.
�Simon this isn&#8217;t funny anymore.�
�Good.�
�Good. Then please move,� I said half-assedly pushing against his thighs. 
He jerked my hair again. Harder this time.�No.� 
�Simon, Simon please. This is not funny.� I repeated starting to panic.
�Open your mouth,� he said ignoring me.
For a fleeting second I thought about doing something ridiculously clich� like mentioning Carmen and how Simon was standing with his cock out in front of his brother&#8217;s girlfriend. But I figured stating the obvious would be insulting his intelligence and mine.&nbsp; I was starting to pant but as I hesitated a few seconds too long I felt him increase the pressure on my hair that he had just about let go off.&nbsp; I lightly tried to push at his thighs again trying to see if he would finally give. But he didn&#8217;t. Instead he increased the pressure on my hair stretching my neck upwards. 
So I opened my mouth.
He slid his cock into my mouth and four inches, about half of it, went in pretty easily. He started slowly moving in and out softly establishing a slow rhythm. He wasn&#8217;t any longer than Camren but he was thicker.&nbsp; And as he fed more and more in I could really feel the stretch on my lips. After a few minutes of a steady rhythm for some god awful reason I voluntarily, I think just to relieve some of the stress, put my hand on his cock and started pumping it as I started to bob my head at the rhythm he had established.&nbsp; I pushed him backwards and I heard the coffee table skid behind him has he made room for me on my knees between him and the couch.&nbsp; I had been giving head since I was 14 and in the last 10 years I had gotten pretty good at it. It&#8217;s odd to say I felt comfortable doing it. I could shut everything else out while I was going down on a guy and just concentrate on responding to the cock I had in my mouth. And that&#8217;s what I did because the situation I was in was too absurd to comprehend. I concentrated on just sucking his cock for a full 10 minutes.&nbsp; I varied the rhythm when I thought necessary, occasionally pulling it out and sucking on his balls. Then I&#8217;d start again by sucking the head and playing with it with my tongue and slowly letting more and more of his cock into my throat with each bob of my head. After about 10 minutes I felt his thighs as I was holding onto them get to a certain point of tightness that told me he was in the final stage before cumming when the muscles in your entire body go rigid with anticipation. 
I felt him suddenly tighten the grip on my hair and before I was ready for it he started thrusting forward into my mouth faster and faster. I tried to keep up till I knew I couldn&#8217;t and just let him use my mouth. I concentrated instead at pushing out against his thighs, instead of holding on to them. I tried everything I could to sneak a breath in.&nbsp; My hair felt like he was pulling it out in an effort to keep my face still as he violently drilled into mouth again and again till I felt his cock twitch. He held me down against his balls, stuffing as much of his cock down my throat as possible. 
 He seemed to be enjoying the spasms of my gagging throat trying to throw up, not throw up, and find a breath all at the same time, but with my throat closed off I could do none of those things. I couldn&#8217;t breathe at all and I had no reserve air left. I couldn&#8217;t breathe. I couldn&#8217;t breathe. Fuck fuck fuck I couldn&#8217;t breathe. I started to panic and what was only a couple of minutes of chocking felt like half an hour.&nbsp; His cum sputtered down my throat and even after he was finished cumming he held me down, his pelvis still thrust against my face, till his cock completely stopped twitching and stood still for awhile.
Finally he pulled me off his cock by my hair and as I came up for air coughing and sputtering. He let go of me backed up a few steps and lifted my chin so I was looking at him eye to eye again. He then proceeded to the most ridiculously inappropriate but somehow sensible thing. Smiling, he patted me gently on the top of my head and said, �Good girl.�












(read part one first for more clarity)



THURSDAY



The next day Simon pretended like nothing had happened.&nbsp; I had done a depressed job of pretending nothing had happened with Camren last night but Simon he did a smiling, jovial job of pretending nothing had happened. He was his usual larger than life self. At first I thought he was crazy and then that I was crazy. That maybe I�d dreamt it. But then I noticed that he didn�t stand too close to me this morning. And he didn�t �accidently� brush against an indelicate part of my body like he usually did twice a day.&nbsp; I wasn�t sure which one I preferred. Pretending nothing had happened or acknowledging something did. I decided to take his queue and do both. Afterall I was in no hurry to explain to Camren how I ended up on my knees in front of Simon.&nbsp; If Simon denied having done anything untoward I�m not sure whose side Camren would take. They were brothers and he�d been in Camren�s life a lot longer than I had been.





FRIDAY



It wasn�t till after I had gotten home from work on Friday that I remembered Camren was leaving for some work thing for the weekend. I had hoped that the fake buoyancy would be the worst of it but Simon greeted me in the livingroom when I got home with an icy smile that sent panic through my system.&nbsp; I decided I would spend the night at a friend�s house. There was no way I was going to spend a whole weekend with him alone. I left as inconspicuously as possible to go pack in my room. I put jeans, a couple of T-shirts and other essentials into a day-bag and opened my bedroom door. Simon was there in the hallway. Still smiling. My panic grew as my heart missed a beat and started pounding.



�I think you are mad at me,� Simon said, almost sounding concerned. He was wearing nothing but boxers again. They were the standard issue blue and white plaid. I thought I could see the tip of his half hard penis poking out through the flap. In his boxers, his wide shoulders were set off by his waist and somehow made him seem bigger. 



�No, I�m not mad,� I replied, �I was just going to keep a friend of mine company because she just got dumped.�



�Which friend?� he asked.



�You don�t know her.� I said unable to come up with anything more convincing in my panic.



�What about me? What if I needed to be kept company?�



�Well call one of your friends,� I said a little more boldly, full of sarcasm, �I�m sure there are 10 girls who�d love to keep you company.�



�See now that makes me think you are mad,� he said, icy again.



�Simon please, just let me leave.� I said, standing in the doorway, clutching my bag.



�No,� he said, paused, and then added, �I know why you�re mad and I want to make it better.�



�Why am I mad Simon?� I said, my nails digging into my hand from holding on to my bag for dear life. I had no idea what I wanted his answer to be.



�You�re mad because the other day only I got some and you didn�t get any,� he said soberly, �And I want to fix that. If you�ll let me.�



If I�d let him? If I�d let him? Really? He had moved in closer to block the door and I had refused to back down into my room so we stood close enough for me to smell his breath. Though there was nothing particularly rank about it I felt like throwing up. I dropped my bag thinking a smaller me would be easier to get past him. I ducked, muttering something about needing a glass of water, and tried to maneuver myself past him. It didn�t work. He pushed me back into the room and closed the door behind him.



�Simon I�m fine,� I said, my voice changing volumes all on its own, �You don�t need to reciprocate, or whatever.�



�But I want you to know I�m not selfish,� he said, full of sincerity. He grabbed a hold of my arm and the front of my jeans in one motion, �Now I don�t want to hear another word about it, okay?�



His hands first stumbled on the button and then got it open. I was very hot and even more uncomfortable. �Simon please don�t,� I muttered weakly.



He pushed me down on the bed then and I felt a sudden dull pain as he punched me in the stomach. Not too hard but hard enough to make me gasp for breath. �I told you I don�t want to hear nothing more from you. It�s your turn to get some.�



�Simon STOP,� I said yelling the word in full panic now, letting all the pretenses fall. I began to kick my legs at him without connecting to anything vital.&nbsp; I was going to get out of this. This was not going to happen.&nbsp; Why hadn�t I just left when Camren was still here? What the fuck was wrong with me.&nbsp; And what the fuck was wrong with him. What the fuck did he think he was doing, �GET OFF ME SIMON.� I said yelling.



Simon took his time getting my legs under control, trapping them as he had done yesterday between his massive body and the side of the bed and then he very matter-of-factly slapped me against the face and just as matter-of-factly&nbsp; said, �Stop struggling.�



The first slap didn�t hurt. Neither did the second, but the third and the fourth and the fifth � slap, Slap, SLAP � getting stronger and stronger on the same spot on my cheek started to cut and as my adrenaline died down so did my fight. I felt trapped and hopeless and I started to cry. I tried to stop but couldn�t.



Simon smiled down at me from above and kissed me under my eyes right where the tears were falling and said something that sounded so clich� and so threatening at the same time, �I don�t want to hurt you but I will,� and then he punched me in the stomach again to make his point. Hard this time. Making&nbsp; me double over, my ass rising off the bed. The pain made me clench my eyes shut and lose all other sensations.&nbsp; 



Simon used the opportunity to hook his hands on my jeans and pull them off.&nbsp; He lay half standing half lying on me for a few seconds not doing anything. His hand rested on top of my underwear. The heat from his hand combined with the heat from my crotch made me feel like I was burning. Like when you leave your hand in an oven too long. The pain from the punch had blocked out all sense of the situation but he had given me a few seconds to collect myself and I was panicking again.&nbsp; This was not right. This was not going to happen. What the fuck was I going to do. And more than that how was going to live with him after. Especially around Camren. Damn Camren. Why did he have to leave. 



Before I could form a complete coherent thought he slipped his hand inside my underwear and made slow circles with his thumb around my clit.&nbsp; I cried in earnest now. I was dry on the outside but inside, if he slipped a finger in it would be over. It would be over.&nbsp; He�d win.&nbsp; But Simon was content to finger my clit for a few more minutes, kissing my teary cheeks, my lips, the side of my neck and whispering in his most soothing voice, �It�s okay. I promise this will be fun. It�s okay. Just relax. I�ll make it good.�



I was still crying but I had stopped panicking. I had even started to relax a little as much as one could under the circumstances when suddenly he stuck one fat finger inside my pussy. I involuntarily made a guttural sound and he smiled feeling the juices that he had somehow elicited starting to flow . He forced another finger in making me groan again. He slowly pulled them both out, glistening. His smile grew wider and he seemed to be studying his fingers for a few seconds before he stuck them in my face and said, �Suck.�



When I didn�t open my mouth he put his other hand around my throat and squeezed lightly till I opened up. I had stopped crying mostly because I was too dazed. He put his fingers in and I sucked. I sucked hard like I had sucked his dick two nights ago. Ignoring the pressure on my neck. Ignoring him when he added, �See I told you this was your turn to get some.� 



He removed his fingers from my mouth. They were now wet with saliva and vaginal secretions and pulled down my panties. I had long since stopped actively resisting. He pushed his fingers back in my pussy, rubbing my clit faster with his now wet thumb.



�Simon, please � � I said, not bothering to finish the sentence.



He grinned. Actually grinned, and kissed me, pushing his tongue through my passive lips and into my mouth playing with my tongue which was trying to avoid his more than anything else.&nbsp; With his tongue still down my throat he felt my breath quicken and become ragged. He took that as a cue, pushed his boxers down and thrust the dick he had thrust down my throat, into my pussy. I made a wordless throaty sound as he pushed. 



He rested there and I felt my vaginal muscles contract around his penis several times as if willing more of it in. He grabbed me by the throat and pushed me further up on the bed so I was lying fully on my back now.&nbsp; He started pounding into, his hand still wrapped around my throat squeezing tightly now. It didn�t feel good exactly but it didn�t feel bad either. It felt better than it should and I wanted to scream but that would take too much air. I was breathing shallower and shallower as he thrust harder and harder and squeezed tighter and tighter. 



I started attacking his hand with mine as my vision got narrower and black started spreading around the edges. But even as I was trying to pull his hands off my throat I came. Noticeably . My back arched off the bed for a full ten seconds and I stopped resisting the hand around my neck pushing down on his dick as wave after wave of orgasm pushed me over the edge.&nbsp; As if he had been waiting for me to cum, he thrust a few more times before cumming himself. 



 His hand loosened around my neck and he collapsed on top of me. For a moment he just lay there breathing hard. Then, he started sucking and biting one spot on my neck. I felt him bruise the skin and I knew he had left a nice sized mark.
