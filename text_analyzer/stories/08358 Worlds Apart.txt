Worlds Apart

W. L. Telford

1

Ross Edwards walked from a good meeting into a bad day.&nbsp; More than a bad day.&nbsp; He stepped into hell.&nbsp;&nbsp; 

But as he moved along the corridor from the conference room to his private office on the 33rd floor of the TXK Building, facing south, overlooking the Straits of Singapore and a roadstead full of ships waiting to offload cargo, he had no inkling that in a few more minutes his life would change irrevocably.&nbsp; Instead he was going over the details of the deal he had just successfully concluded to license to a Chinese manufacturer technology developed by the year old start-up of which he was the President of International Marketing.&nbsp; 

It was a major breakthrough, and the reason his office was in Singapore, between the two rapidly growing Asian giants, China and India, where his and perhaps the world&#8217;s future lay.

He nodded to Li, his personal assistant, as he passed, then closed the door of his office behind him.

A corner office with walls of glass, the view was breathtaking.&nbsp; Beyond the dozens of anchored ships, were a few small islands that were also a part of the State of Singapore, and then open water on which a steady procession of more ships moved east and west in shipping lanes as if on a divided highway, and in the distance other islands, these Indonesian.

Ross Edwards kept his desk clear.&nbsp; It was a big desk of modern design, the top a smooth expanse of hand rubbed teak on which sat two laptops, a MacBook Pro for work, a personal MacBook Air.&nbsp; Checking the Pro first, he saw that Li, who had access to his business email accounts, had already dealt with the most recent arrivals.&nbsp; 

He opened the Air and logged into his personal Gmail.&nbsp; A little after 10:00 a.m in Singapore on Wednesday morning was just after 7:00 p.m. on Tuesday in San Diego, where Carol, his wife,&nbsp; an architect, had remained when he had to move overseas.&nbsp; Usually she emailed when she got home from work.&nbsp; However, there was only one email, and it was not from her.&nbsp; The sender was B. Tomalin and the subject:&nbsp; she called me.&nbsp; 

Ross did not know a B. Tomalin.&nbsp; Routinely he deleted such emails unread, but the subject gave him pause.&nbsp; Who was �she� and what did it have to do with him?&nbsp; 

After hesitating briefly, he opened the email.

The only text was an automated �From the office of Brad Tomalin.�&nbsp; At that moment Ross had no idea of the arrogance and insolence of those simple words.

There were two attachments:&nbsp; a jpeg and an mpeg.

This was a different matter.&nbsp; Perhaps if he had been using Windows, he wouldn&#8217;t have, but on a a Mac, again he hesitated only momentarily before opening the image, and then he froze, stunned.

The picture was of an office much like his own:&nbsp; spacious, lots of glass, to one side a sofa and two arm chairs around a low table, centered was a big gleaming black desk behind which sat a man, who again was much like Ross.&nbsp; Around forty years old, probably shorter and more solidly built, although you couldn&#8217;t really tell because he was sitting in a well padded black swivel chair.&nbsp; He was wearing an impeccably tailored dark blue suit, white shirt, maroon tie.&nbsp; His hands rested comfortably on each arm of the chair. Palms down.&nbsp; Fingers relaxed.

The camera angle was from one side of the desk, and the man had swiveled to face it.&nbsp; He was looking directly into the lens, directly at Ross, and he was smiling.&nbsp; As well he should be.&nbsp; For between his shining black tasseled loafers and neatly creased trousered legs knelt&nbsp; a naked woman.&nbsp; Her head was buried in his lap.&nbsp; Her face was not visible.&nbsp; But Ross Edwards didn&#8217;t need to see the face.&nbsp; He knew that body, the flair of those hips, the cleft of that ass, the narrow waist, the indentation of that spine--they had been married for seven years and lived together for a year before that:&nbsp; he had traced that spine with his fingertips a thousand times--the shoulder length light brown, almost blond hair.&nbsp; 

What in the name of the nonexistent gods?&nbsp; he thought.&nbsp; What in hell?

The intercom buzzer roused him from immobility.&nbsp; Reaching blindly to one side, his eyes still glued to the image of his naked wife sucking on another man&#8217;s cock--though he couldn&#8217;t actually see her mouth, it was obvious where it was and what was in it--he pushed a button and said, �Not now.�&nbsp; Then on the MacBook Air opened the audio file.


�Stop.

Don&#8217;t take another step.&nbsp; Don&#8217;t say a word until I tell you that my office is set up for video taping.&nbsp; I&#8217;ve found it useful dealing with staff and clients.&nbsp; There can be no confusion about what has been said or agreed upon.&nbsp; And I always let people know it is being done.&nbsp; I&#8217;ve already pushed the button.&nbsp; Everything you say and do is being recorded.&nbsp; You understand?�

Silence.

�It&#8217;s not enough to nod.&nbsp; Either say &#8216;Yes&#8217; aloud or turn around and walk back through that door.�

Ross heard his wife&#8217;s strained voice.&nbsp; �Yes.�

�Good.&nbsp; No.&nbsp; Stay there.&nbsp; You said over the telephone that &#8216;you had to see me.&#8217;&nbsp; So you see me.&nbsp; What do you want?�

Silence lengthened.&nbsp; Finally in a voice that began hesitantly, then became more determined, �I want...I want you...to make me feel something.�

A man&#8217;s laughter.&nbsp; �I knew you&#8217;d call.&nbsp; I just thought it would take longer.&nbsp; 

All right, then.&nbsp; I&#8217;ll make you feel something.&nbsp;&nbsp; Show it to me.&nbsp; Strip.

No.&nbsp; Stay there.�

Indistinct sounds, which Ross knew but could not yet really believe were Carol taking off her clothes in front of this stranger.&nbsp; But then he wasn&#8217;t a stranger to her.&nbsp; What was she wearing?&nbsp; Her clothes weren&#8217;t in the picture.&nbsp; She usually dressed so conservatively at work.&nbsp; Stylish suits with knee length skirts or slacks, hiding her spectacular legs.&nbsp; Low heels.&nbsp; Work was work and she did not want her beauty to be a complication.

�Just let it drop on the carpet.&nbsp; Rumpled is sexy.�

�Nice lingerie.&nbsp; When you put that bra and panties on this morning, you were hoping I would see you take them off. 

That requires a response.�

�Yes.�

�You are a great looking piece.&nbsp; I&#8217;ll give you that.&nbsp; Better even than I remembered�

&#8216;Piece?&#8217;, thought Ross.&nbsp; A deliberately degrading term.&nbsp; Piece of ass.&nbsp; Piece of meat.&nbsp; But Carol had called him, had not turned and walked out, had striped naked.&nbsp; This Brad obviously could call her whatever he wanted.

�I see you remembered what I said about liking it shaved.&nbsp; You thought about me while you were doing that too.�&nbsp; It was a statement, not a question.

�Yes.�

�Great tits.&nbsp; I love big nipples.&nbsp; Can you reach them with your tongue?�

�I don&#8217;t know.�

A short laugh.&nbsp; �You&#8217;ve never tried?�

�No.�

�Well lift them and try now.

See, I thought you could.&nbsp; Now the other one.&nbsp; 

Feel good?�

�Strange.�

�Turn around.&nbsp; I want to see the other side again.

Stop there.&nbsp; That&#8217;s good.&nbsp; Move your feet farther apart.&nbsp; Farther.&nbsp; Good.&nbsp; Now bend over and grab your ankles.&nbsp; Keep your legs straight.&nbsp; Beautiful.

O.K.&nbsp; keep your waist bent and reach back with&nbsp; both hands and spread your ass.&nbsp; Pull those cheeks as far apart as you can.�

For moments that lengthened the only sound was of labored breathing.&nbsp; Ross couldn&#8217;t tell if it was her&#8217;s or his.

�Do you remember how hard my cock got just before it spurted its load deep in your ass?�

Now it was obvious that at least some of the labored breathing was Carol&#8217;s.&nbsp; �Yes.�

But she doesn&#8217;t even like anal, thought Ross, who was completely unprepared for what came next.

�Do you remember how full your cunt felt with my fist?�

�Y..yes.�

�How you screamed when it went it?�

�Yes.�

�And how you screamed when you came?�

�Yes.&nbsp; Yes.�&nbsp; Almost desperately.

�Picture how you look at this very moment:&nbsp; naked in an office in the middle of a business day, bent over, exposing everything you&#8217;ve got to a man you&#8217;ve only seen once before.&nbsp; You know you are lost?�

�Yes.�

A cynical laugh.&nbsp; �You wanted me to make you feel something.&nbsp; Are you feeling something?�

�Yes.�

�What?�

�Embarrassed&nbsp; Humiliated.&nbsp; Uncertain.&nbsp; Frightened.&nbsp; Aroused.�

�Good.&nbsp; But we can improve on that.&nbsp; Come over here and suck my cock.�

So this is the source of the image, thought Ross, an opinion he would soon have to reconsider.

Sounds of a chair, clothes, a zipper.&nbsp; Wet sounds.&nbsp; In his mind Ross saw her lips wrapped around the man&#8217;s cock.&nbsp; Saw her head moving up and down as it so often had over him.&nbsp; How could she?

�Ahh.&nbsp; That&#8217;s good.&nbsp; Let me feel more tongue.&nbsp; Good.&nbsp; Good.&nbsp; That&#8217;s it.

You&#8217;re a pretty good cocksucker.&nbsp; Obviously you&#8217;ve had a lot of practice. Though you&#8217;re going to be better.&nbsp; Your husband should have trained you to take it all.&nbsp; So since he didn&#8217;t, I will.&nbsp; Hold still.&nbsp; Be careful with your teeth.&nbsp; Relax your throat.&nbsp; You don&#8217;t move.&nbsp; I&#8217;ll&nbsp; move your head with my hands.�

Sputtering.&nbsp; Gagging.&nbsp; A gasp for air.

�Not bad.&nbsp; Almost.&nbsp; Let&#8217;s try again.�

Again gagging.

�All right for now.&nbsp; But make no mistake, you will take it all.&nbsp; And soon.�

How can he be so certain?, thought Ross.

�It&#8217;s wet enough.&nbsp; Get up on my deck.&nbsp; On your back.&nbsp; Feet up.�

Sounds of bodies moving.

�Ohh.&nbsp; Not there.&nbsp; Please.�

A hand slapping flesh.&nbsp; 

�You don&#8217;t tell me where.&nbsp; You don&#8217;t tell me anything.&nbsp; You&#8217;ve already taken my cock up all your holes.&nbsp; Say one more word and I will take it out and you can get dressed and get out.&nbsp; 

No?&nbsp; I thought not.�

For several minutes the sounds of sodomy.&nbsp; Not flesh on flesh.&nbsp; As far as Ross could tell the man had not undressed.&nbsp; But rhythmic moans from Carol on each inward thrust.&nbsp; �Oh.&nbsp; Oh.&nbsp; Oh.&nbsp; Oh.�&nbsp; Heavier breathing, grunts from the man.

�I didn&#8217;t tell you you could touch your cunt.�

Half gasping, half sobbing, �But I want to come.&nbsp; Please put it in my pussy.�

�Cunt.�

�Cunt.&nbsp; Please.&nbsp; Fuck my cunt.&nbsp;&nbsp; I need to come.�

�You&#8217;ll get to come all you want this weekend.&nbsp; More than you want.�

Weekend? wondered Ross.

Abruptly the grunts and gasps stopped.

Someone shifted position.&nbsp; A chair squeaked.

�Come down from there.&nbsp; I want to finish in your mouth.�

Ass to mouth?&nbsp; She wouldn&#8217;t, thought Ross.&nbsp; She never had with him.&nbsp; He&#8217;d never even asked.

But from the sounds obviously she would.

�Ahh.&nbsp; Ahh.&nbsp; Ahh.&nbsp; That&#8217;s it.&nbsp; Cup my balls.&nbsp; Take it all.&nbsp; Take it.&nbsp; Take it.&nbsp; Swallow.�

And the recording ended.


For ten minutes Ross Edwards, trauma victim, sat motionless behind his beautiful teak desk.&nbsp; 

In other offices in the TXK Building and on the streets of the city far below, life went on.&nbsp; A predominately Chinese city, though founded by an Englishman whose name had become a hotel.&nbsp; A city of business that meant business.&nbsp; The cleanest, safest, most soulless city in Asia.&nbsp; A city that made nothing, but facilitated everything.&nbsp; Impossibly life went on.&nbsp; 

When Ross Edwards regained his senses, he telephoned his home on the other side of the Pacific Ocean.&nbsp; On the fourth ring, the answering machine picked up.&nbsp; �It&#8217;s me,�&nbsp; he said.&nbsp; �Call me.�

But she didn&#8217;t for two days. 









2

When the call finally came, early on the second afternoon, Ross glanced at his watch.&nbsp; It was almost midnight in San Diego.

�Hello.�

�It&#8217;s me.�

�I knew that from caller I.D.�&nbsp; He struggled to keep his voice flat, neutral.&nbsp; 

�Come back.�&nbsp; 

�Why?�

�I need you.�

�Is that why you&#8217;ve been fucking this Brad?

�Maybe.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t know.&nbsp; I asked you not to go to Singapore.�

�And I told you I had to.&nbsp; It is my job, and this is the place where it has to be done.&nbsp; You could have come with me.�

�I have my own career and it is here.&nbsp; I didn&#8217;t spend all those years at Stanford just to sit around playing bridge with a bunch of ex-pat wives.�

They both ran down and were silent.&nbsp; Finally she started again, 
�We&#8217;ve been through all that too many times already.�

�Yes, we have.&nbsp; What we haven&#8217;t been through is your telling me about the interesting little email I received the other day.�

�What do you want to know?�

�What the hell do you think I want to know?&nbsp; I see a photograph of you naked on your knees sucking another man&#8217;s cock and listen to him fuck your ass, and you ask what I want to know?�

Silence.

�Start with how you met this guy.�

�Last Saturday.&nbsp; At one of those charity things.&nbsp; It was my turn to represent the office.&nbsp; I went alone--if you&#8217;d been here this never would have happened--and was seated at a table with four couples and Brad, who is divorced and also was there alone.&nbsp; I only knew one of the other couples:&nbsp; the husband is with one of the engineering firms we sometimes use.&nbsp; 

During dinner Brad and I talked.&nbsp; He is very confident, very smart, and was amusing.&nbsp; It was nice to have someone take an interest in me.&nbsp; 

After dinner there was the usual charity blind auction and then a band for dancing.&nbsp; I was just getting ready to leave when Brad asked me to dance, and I thought why not?&nbsp; 

It was nice, and then there was a slower dance and he held me a little closer, nothing improper, and then by accident or on purpose, I don&#8217;t know which, another couple may have bumped into him, but his body pressed against mine and I felt his cock rock hard through his trousers and my dress,&nbsp; It was only momentary.&nbsp; He immediately pulled back.&nbsp; But it was electric.&nbsp; And when it happened again a minute later, we both knew that this time it wasn&#8217;t an accident. 

We were still dancing, and he was looking at my face to see what I was going to do, to see if I pulled away.&nbsp; But it felt so good.&nbsp; I&#8217;m so tired of masturbating.&nbsp; It was right there.&nbsp; I wanted a cock, and yours was seven thousand miles away.&nbsp; This one was only a few thin layers of fabric away.

When I didn&#8217;t pull away, he pressed a little closer.&nbsp; And I pressed back.

The song ended.&nbsp; He said, &#8216;Meet me in the lobby in ten minutes.&#8217;&nbsp; I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve said the event was at the Hyatt.&nbsp; He didn&#8217;t ask.&nbsp; He just said to meet him.&nbsp; That is one of his attractions.

I went back to the table, said good night, went to the lobby.&nbsp; He had taken a room.&nbsp; I felt the knowing eyes of the man at the desk on me as we walked to the elevator, but I didn&#8217;t care.

We went up to the room and I spent the night with him.�

�And you think that&#8217;s it?

You didn&#8217;t just spend the night with him.&nbsp; You let him fuck you inside out and stick his fist up your cunt.&nbsp; You did more with him in one night than you&#8217;ve done with me in eight years.�

�It all just happened.&nbsp; I told you he doesn&#8217;t ask.&nbsp; He just goes ahead and does things.&nbsp; Do you want details?�

�I already have more details than I want.&nbsp; I want&nbsp; explanations.�

�About what specifically?�

�Why you gave him your ass, for one thing?�

�I didn&#8217;t give it.&nbsp; He took it.�

�Not, from the sound of the recording I heard, against your will.�

�Look.&nbsp; We went up there, our clothes flew off, and we fucked.&nbsp; First missionary, then he turned me over onto my knees.&nbsp; Still in my vagina.

It felt so good.&nbsp; I was so hungry.&nbsp; So empty.&nbsp; And he is strong.&nbsp; Lots of energy.&nbsp; He made me come two or three times--I&#8217;m not sure--before he did.

And then we collapsed and lay there, still entangled.&nbsp; 

Finally he rolled away and got a bottle of white wine from the in-room bar, and brought me a glass.&nbsp; I was already a little drunk, but I&#8217;m not using that as an excuse.

We drank some wine and talked, and then he leaned forward and kissed me on the mouth, something he hadn&#8217;t done, and when we broke, his hand was behind my head, guiding it toward his waist.&nbsp; I let him.&nbsp; He had brought me pleasure; I wanted to please him.&nbsp; 

Our juices had dried on his cock.&nbsp; I could taste them, but I didn&#8217;t care.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I said that before, but that was it:&nbsp; that night I just didn&#8217;t care.&nbsp; I sucked his cock and he came.�

�You swallowed.�

�Yes.�

�You don&#8217;t like to swallow mine.�

�This was different.&nbsp; He was a stranger.&nbsp; I wanted him to like me.�

�And you don&#8217;t care if I like you?�

�You know that&#8217;s not what I meant.&nbsp; It&#8217;s different with someone the first time than with a spouse you can count on.�

�And the rest?�

�The rest?�

�You do recall his fist up your cunt?&nbsp; He said you screamed when it went in, so I assume it was memorable.�

�After he came in my mouth, he went down on me.&nbsp; 

I was a little surprised because his come was in me, but he only licked around my clit.

It felt good.&nbsp; I&#8217;d had more wine by then and was feeling it.&nbsp; I put my head back and closed my eyes and just enjoyed the sensations.

As he used his tongue on me, I felt him slip a finger in and began to move it in and out.&nbsp; That felt even better.&nbsp; 

After a while I sensed that he had added a second finger, then a third.&nbsp; And he was fucking me with them harder.&nbsp; I was feeling fuller and fuller. 

I was building toward orgasm.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t recall the fourth finger or his thumb, but he must have slipped them in, for suddenly, unexpectedly, there was this shock of pain and I screamed.&nbsp; My head jerked off the pillow.&nbsp; He looked up at me and said, �It&#8217;s o.k.&nbsp; It&#8217;s going to be all right.&nbsp; It&#8217;s in and it&#8217;s going to feel very good now.�&nbsp; I looked down and couldn&#8217;t believe that his wrist just ended at my lips, and I realized that his entire hand was in me.&nbsp; I think I whimpered.&nbsp; 

He said, �It doesn&#8217;t hurt now, does it?�&nbsp; And it didn&#8217;t.&nbsp; I nodded no.

&#8216;Put your head back and just enjoy.&nbsp; It will be phenomenal.&#8217;

I lowered my head back on the pillow and closed my eyes again.&nbsp; I&#8217;ve never felt so full.&nbsp; I mean you have a great cock; but nobody has a cock that thick. 

He began to move his arm slowly and stroke me from the inside with his fingers.&nbsp; There must be something inside me slightly off center.&nbsp; You know how hard I come when you fuck me with one leg over your shoulder, rather than two.&nbsp; Well, whatever it is, he touched it and stroked it as he fucked me with his fist harder, and I exploded.&nbsp; He said I screamed again.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t recall.&nbsp; I think I may have actually passed out from pleasure, have been for a few moments unconscious.

Well, you asked.�

�And your ass?�

She sighed.

�That was later.&nbsp; Sometime during the night.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t know when.

We finished the bottle of wine and fell asleep.&nbsp; I woke when he slipped the end of his cock in me.&nbsp; There was momentary pain then, too, but nothing like his fist.&nbsp; Nothing bad.&nbsp; I was relaxed and maybe still wet from lots of juices.&nbsp; For all I know he may have lubricated it with something.&nbsp; Anyway it slipped in fairly easily.&nbsp; And I just lay there on my side without saying anything, without moving, really without responding in any way.&nbsp; I just let him do it.&nbsp; 

He put his left hand at the base of my neck and the right on my hip--I was on my left side--and held me firmly and took me.&nbsp; His cock is long like yours.&nbsp; And soon it was thrusting all the way up me.&nbsp; It didn&#8217;t feel good or bad.&nbsp; You know I don&#8217;t come from anal.&nbsp; And even though he&#8217;d already come twice, his breathing quickly became ragged and I felt it get hard as cocks do when the semen is flooding from the balls; and he buried it all the way in me and held there.&nbsp; I couldn&#8217;t actually feel the come spurt out, but I did feel his cock pulse.&nbsp; 

After a minute or so, he pulled out.&nbsp; I didn&#8217;t say anything.&nbsp; Just fell back asleep.

And, so that it&#8217;s all out in the open, in the morning he fucked me again, or he had me fuck him.&nbsp; I was on top.&nbsp; 

Then he said he had to leave.&nbsp; He didn&#8217;t offer an explanation.&nbsp; He showered, got dressed, put a business card on my purse, and left.

And after a while I went home and soaked in a hot bath.�

�But you kept his card.�

�Yes.�

�And you called him.�

�Yes.�

And when Ross didn&#8217;t say anything, she continued.

�I wasn&#8217;t going to. 

I&#8217;m not going to lie to you.&nbsp; I felt good Sunday afternoon.&nbsp; My body was sore.&nbsp; But it was a good sore.&nbsp; I&#8217;d needed sex.&nbsp; I&#8217;d had some great orgasms.&nbsp; I was relaxed instead of tense.&nbsp;&nbsp; There was a post-coital glow.&nbsp; I went to bed early and had the soundest sleep since you flew away.

Monday morning I still felt good.&nbsp; But as the day went on, I became increasingly distracted.&nbsp; I was too aware of my body.&nbsp; My breasts shifting as I moved.&nbsp; My thighs rubbing together.&nbsp; It was as though my nerve endings were exposed.&nbsp; Everything was heightened.&nbsp; And it began to make me anxious.&nbsp; Driving home that evening, I was at a stop light and glanced over at the car next to me.&nbsp; My eyes were drawn to the man&#8217;s hands on the steering wheel.&nbsp; I didn&#8217;t even see him.&nbsp; Just his hands.&nbsp; I wanted them on me.

I didn&#8217;t sleep well that night.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the next morning, after telling myself countless times that I shouldn&#8217;t, I took out his card and called him.

You know the rest.�

�Are you in love with him?�

�No.&nbsp; And he is certainly not in love with me.�

�In the recording he said something about this weekend.�

�He told me to be out front at 7:00 p.m. tomorrow night.&nbsp; He made it clear that he is not coming up here.&nbsp; I&#8217;m to be down there waiting for him.&nbsp; He&#8217;ll drive by and if I&#8217;m not there, he&#8217;ll just keep on going.&nbsp; He has a place up in the mountains, somewhere around Julian, but on the side overlooking the desert.&nbsp; His father was a small farmer in the Imperial Valley and he likes looking down on where he came from.&nbsp; He&#8217;s going to take me up there to share with some of his friends.�

�What?&nbsp; A gang-bang?�

�I guess that&#8217;s what it&#8217;s called.�

�You&#8217;re not going.&nbsp; You can&#8217;t.�

�He was right when he said that I&#8217;m lost.&nbsp; Come back and save me.�

 �I have to be in Shanghai on Monday, and I couldn&#8217;t get there by tomorrow night anyway.�

�Someone else can go to Shanghai, and it will be enough if I know you are coming.&nbsp; That you&#8217;re on a plane.�

�I can&#8217;t send someone else.&nbsp; I&#8217;m meeting with CEOs.&nbsp; They would be insulted if I foisted them off with Ted or Jim.&nbsp; And I won&#8217;t be emotionally blackmailed.&nbsp; You can get on a plane as easily, more easily than I can.�

�Then it looks as though I&#8217;m going to have an interesting weekend.�

�Carol, don&#8217;t do this.�

�I don&#8217;t think I mentioned that he told me to wear just a coat and shoes.&nbsp; Nothing else.&nbsp; I won&#8217;t need clothes.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;From:&nbsp; The Office of Brad Tomalin

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Subject:&nbsp; call

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;619 433-8044&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 8 p.m. Friday&nbsp; our time


----------

Carol Edwards left the office early Friday.&nbsp; For over an hour after her telephone conversation with Ross the preceding night she hadn&#8217;t been able to get to sleep, and she wasn&#8217;t able to concentrate on work that morning.&nbsp; Fortunately nothing important required her attention.

Back at their condo on the crest of Point Loma, overlooking the city skyline and San Diego Bay, she mixed a martini and ran a bath.&nbsp; She seldom drank during the day; but this was not an ordinary day.

She leaned back in the tub.&nbsp; Was she really going to do this?

Nipples and toes were islands.&nbsp; Her hands started to slide down her body, then stopped.&nbsp; Brad had told her not to masturbate.&nbsp; He wanted to watch her explode into orgasm as the first of many strangers fucked her.&nbsp; She hadn&#8217;t come since last Sunday.&nbsp; She would explode. 

He had said she would come that weekend more than she even wanted to.&nbsp; That she would be fucked senseless.&nbsp; Literally.&nbsp; What would that be like?&nbsp; To come and come and come.&nbsp; To be unable to stop coming.&nbsp; To be fucked into oblivion.

She raised her hands from the water and reached for the martini glass on the wide tile ledge beside the sunken tub.&nbsp; She didn&#8217;t want her hands on her body.&nbsp; She wanted men&#8217;s hands.&nbsp; And mouths.&nbsp; And cocks.&nbsp; Her thoughts paused.&nbsp; Cocks?&nbsp; Plural?&nbsp; She had never been with more than one man at a time, and not even that many men.&nbsp; Only eight, including Brad.&nbsp; She had no idea how many there would be tonight and tomorrow; or how long it would last.&nbsp; And once she was there, she would be completely in their power.&nbsp; What would it be like to be naked in a room full of strange men.&nbsp; Their hungry eyes on her like a pack of wild dogs. What would they do to her?&nbsp; Whatever they wanted.&nbsp; Anything they wanted.&nbsp;&nbsp; She doubted they would be gentle.&nbsp; Her pussy spasmed.&nbsp; The prospect was frightening and exciting.

She was tired of being in control.&nbsp; Of always doing the right thing.&nbsp; Of always doing what others expected her to.&nbsp; Of being the good daughter.&nbsp; The good student.&nbsp; The good architect.&nbsp; The good wife.

Martini finished, she stepped from the bath and dried herself, before going into the adjacent master bedroom to check her laptop.&nbsp; Nothing from Ross.&nbsp; She hadn&#8217;t really expected there would be.&nbsp; She wasn&#8217;t even sure she was disappointed there wasn&#8217;t.

Still trying to convince herself she hadn&#8217;t made up her mind, she returned naked to the bathroom and proceeded to shave the stubble from her pussy--no, she thought, cunt as Brad insisted--and from the crack of her ass.&nbsp; The position was awkward and obscene.&nbsp; She studied her puckered anus.&nbsp; Will total strangers be looking at that in a few hours?&nbsp; Not just looking.&nbsp; Spearing with their cocks.&nbsp; Filling with come.&nbsp; It did not seem possible.&nbsp; Everything seemed vaguely unreal; her life a reflection in a hazy mirror.

On those infrequent occasions when she painted her nails she did so only in light pastel shades.&nbsp; Yet on the way home from the office, she had stopped and bought bright red polish.&nbsp; Leaning over to reach her toes, her nipples brushed her thighs.&nbsp; Oh, God, she thought.&nbsp; Oh, god.&nbsp; 

When she was finished, her fingers and toes seemed tipped with blood, as though she was preparing her body for sacrifice.&nbsp; 

She applied a matching deep red lipstick to her mouth, and wondered how long that would last?

Perhaps the martini was responsible for the giggle as she slid open the doors to the walk-in closet and thought:&nbsp; at least I don&#8217;t have to worry about what to wear.&nbsp; She stepped into black high-heeled backless sandals because they would be easy to slip off.&nbsp; Ease of removal, she realized, was likely to become a priority in her choice of attire.

She considered making another martini, but decided not to.&nbsp; She didn&#8217;t want to be drunk.&nbsp; She wanted to be aware of everything.&nbsp; To feel everything.&nbsp; If she went.&nbsp; If�&nbsp; It had felt so good last Saturday night and Sunday morning with Brad, and so intense in his office Tuesday.&nbsp; She craved that intensity.&nbsp; She needed to feel fully alive again.&nbsp; 

Pulling her Burberry trench coat from a hanger, she moved through the condo to the living room, where she sat on the sofa and gazed down at sailboats gliding across the bay far below.&nbsp; She and Ross had sat there side by side so often.&nbsp; Had made love there.&nbsp; Can I really do this? she asked herself yet again.

Time had moved unevenly for days.&nbsp; First it rushed, then it screeched to a halt and crawled.&nbsp; Now it crawled.&nbsp; Automatically she glanced down at her wrist, but she was not wearing a watch.&nbsp;&nbsp; Her eyes were drawn to her wedding ring, which Brad had insisted she wear.&nbsp; Men enjoy knowing they are trashing another man&#8217;s wife, he had said.&nbsp; &#8216;Trashing&#8217;&nbsp; His exact word.&nbsp; She realized that he liked being crude with her, more crude than he naturally was, certainly more crude than he had been at the charity dinner before they danced or all this never would have happened.&nbsp; But did she really want to be trashed? 

He had said that he wouldn&#8217;t let her be physically damaged, but that it would be a life altering experience.&nbsp;&nbsp; And she did want her life altered. Her beauty would not last forever and it was going to waste.&nbsp; She did not want to spend another weekend alone, watching tennis or a movie on television, and drinking too much.

Although she sat motionless, her stomach churned;&nbsp; and when she noticed that the digital cablebox display read 6:45, it did a backflip.&nbsp; For a moment she thought she was going to be ill.&nbsp; What if the elevator was held on another floor and she was seconds too late.&nbsp; In her mind she saw the back of his car disappearing back down the hill. 

Panicked she threw on the Burberry and, fumbling with the belt, dashed for the door.

The elevator came in a&nbsp; few seconds and, feeling foolish, she found herself standing on the curb much too early.&nbsp; 

A trench coat and high heels are not usual attire on San Diego&#8217;s almost invariably sunny evenings, and she felt conspicuous in a residential area of houses, other condominiums, apartments, eucalyptus trees, shrubs, grass, with the street looping up and over the ridge on which her building was poised.&nbsp; And after a few minutes, she became too hot, until a gust of wind blew beneath the coat and shockingly up between her naked thighs.

Without a watch she had no idea of the time.&nbsp; Surely it must be 7 by now.&nbsp; Maybe it is all a cruel hoax and he is sitting somewhere having a drink and laughing at the image of me standing here.&nbsp; Or maybe he&#8217;s caught in traffic.&nbsp; She was not carrying a cell phone, so he couldn&#8217;t call if he was.&nbsp; No cell phone.&nbsp; No watch.&nbsp; No money.&nbsp; No cash.&nbsp; Though she could have put them in a coat pocket.&nbsp; She knew that she had deliberately rendered herself helpless.

From behind her the sound of an opening door.&nbsp; She had hoped that none of her neighbors would see her, but she could not pretend not to notice.&nbsp; it was a small building, fifteen units, three each on five floors, and everyone knew everyone else.&nbsp; She turned and found the one she least wanted to see:&nbsp; Ravi, a small, skinny, twenty-something computer geek from India, who was always staring at her when he thought she wasn&#8217;t looking, particularly when she was in a bikini sunning herself by the swimming pool.&nbsp; He was accompanied by his small, ratty dog, and looked perplexed as he approached.

�Ah, Carol.&nbsp; You are expecting rain, is it?�

�No.�&nbsp; She couldn&#8217;t think of a plausible explanation, so didn&#8217;t offer any.

�It cannot be too cool for you.�&nbsp; His gaze trailed down to her bare legs and painted toes.

�I&#8217;m going to be out late and it will be cooler then.�

�I see.&nbsp; With a friend.�

�Yes.�&nbsp; 

At 5&#8217;8� she was taller than he and looked over his head to where she willed Brad&#8217;s car to appear.&nbsp; She didn&#8217;t even know what kind it was.

�And Ross is in Singapore still?�

�Yes.�

He rattled on, his eyes darting over her, trying to penetrate the folds of her coat, until she wanted to scream.&nbsp; 

Finally sounds of a car coming up the hill, and as she turned&nbsp; a silver Lexis pulled to a stop.&nbsp; Before she could get in, Brad stepped out.&nbsp; Somehow she didn&#8217;t think it was to open the door for her.&nbsp; He was wearing a dark blue short-sleeved knit shirt that stretched tight across his thick shoulders and light tan linen slacks.&nbsp; He was smiling.&nbsp; Ravi stared at him curiously.&nbsp; 

�Well, what have we here?�&nbsp; Brad said.

�This is Ravi, a neighbor.&nbsp; He lives in the unit below ours.�

�I&#8217;m Brad, Ravi.�&nbsp; And he put out a hand that engulfed the slighter man&#8217;s.

&#8216;Pleased to met you.�&nbsp; Ravi seemed suddenly to need to be somewhere else.

�As I drove up, I saw where you were looking and knew that you must be wondering about Carol&#8217;s coat.�

�No.&nbsp; Ah.&nbsp; That is yes.&nbsp; On such a pleasant night.&nbsp; When it will not rain, I think.�

�She is a beautiful woman, isn&#8217;t she?�

�Oh, yes.&nbsp; Everyone knows that.&nbsp; You cannot help but notice that.�

What is he doing, Carol wondered and then discovered.

�I asked her to wear it.&nbsp; She is naked underneath.�

�Oh, no!�&nbsp; said Ravi.

Oh, no!&nbsp; thought Carol.

�Oh, yes,� said Brad.&nbsp; And then instantly, as she knew he would.&nbsp; �Show him.�

�I can&#8217;t�

He just stood looking at her.

�Here?�

He still stood, smiling.

She was angry.&nbsp; Furious.&nbsp; I should turn and go back upstairs.&nbsp; Ross will return soon and we can go on.&nbsp; But her fingers moved as though of their own volition to the coat belt, and then to the top button, down to the next, until finally the last was undone and the coat fell open,&nbsp; revealing a narrow strip of white skin.

Ravi sucked in his breath.&nbsp; �Oh, My.�

�Show it all to him.�

Carol seemed to be viewing herself from a distance, from a point above and to the left, watching another woman from a window.&nbsp; She saw the woman&#8217;s hands pull the coat wide apart.&nbsp; What difference did it make if someone else saw her,&nbsp; if everyone else saw her.

�What is happening here?� croaked Ravi. 

�I&#8217;m taking her to be gangbanged.&nbsp; Clothes aren&#8217;t necessary.�

�I don&#8217;t understand.&nbsp; Who are you?�

�You know what &#8216;gangbanged&#8217; means?�

�Yes.&nbsp; She is going to have sex with many men, isn&#8217;t it?�

�It is.&nbsp; Lovely flesh.&nbsp; Bruiseable�

�Bruiseable?.�

�Great body.&nbsp; Great tits.&nbsp; Go ahead.&nbsp; You can touch.�

Hesitating, Ravi peered questioningly at Carol, who continued to hold her coat open, exposing herself like a flasher, and said nothing.&nbsp; But when his brown hand reached out and tentatively cupped her breast, she cringed.

�Oh, my.&nbsp; Oh, my.�&nbsp; Then gathering courage.&nbsp;&nbsp; �Can I participate?�

�No.&nbsp; The guest list is already full, though I suppose we could always make room for one more.&nbsp; Or,� Brad laughed, �Twenty.

�But everyone has to have a recent STD test.&nbsp; No rubbers.&nbsp; Flesh against flesh.&nbsp; Real holes filled with real cum.&#8217;

Carol winced as Ravi&#8217;s hand tightened.

�But I&#8217;ll tell you what.&nbsp; If you want, have yourself tested and send the results to me.&nbsp; Here&#8217;s my card.&nbsp; And I&#8217;ll give it some thought.&nbsp; Maybe something can be arranged.�

He talks about me as thought he owns me, Carol thought.&nbsp; As though my body is his.&nbsp; How can he be so sure of himself.&nbsp; Of me.&nbsp; But then look at me standing here.

�Close your coat.&nbsp; It&#8217;s time to go.�&nbsp; 

And, surprisingly, he did hold the car door for her.

The sun was setting behind them, but it was still light as&nbsp; the Lexus reached the top of the on-ramp and merged with traffic heading east on Interstate 8.&nbsp; Pulling into a middle lane, Brad said, �Lose the coat.�

She didn&#8217;t even consider refusing.&nbsp; She had climbed on the merry-go-round and there was no getting off.&nbsp; No more decisions to be made.&nbsp; Just do whatever she was told.

�No.&nbsp; Let it fall to your waist.&nbsp; Keep sitting on it.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t want you to leak on the leather, though,� he laughed, �I expect that will be a greater problem on the ride back when you will be gaping.�

�The shoes, too?�

�Doesn&#8217;t matter.&nbsp; They don&#8217;t hide anything.�

She kicked them off.&nbsp; The plush carpet felt sensuous against the soles of her bare feet.

For more than a half hour they sped east. moving beyond the fringes of the city into the darkening desert.&nbsp; He didn&#8217;t talk, so neither did she.&nbsp; 

She had been to Julian, but not often, and remembered that it took more than an hour.&nbsp; The first half on the Interstate; then the last on narrow, twisting state highway 79.&nbsp; She was surprised that the music coming from the multiple speakers was classical.&nbsp; Something Baroque she could not identify. 
 
Night fell, and she stopped wondering if anyone in passing cars or trucks could see her.&nbsp; To be naked seemed natural.&nbsp; Her insides no longer churned.&nbsp;&nbsp; Now that it was decided, she was calm.&nbsp; Until just after they turned off the Interstate and the telephone rang.

A voice actuated system.

Brad said, �Hello, Ross.�

And she heard her husband&#8217;s voice.

�Where are you, you bastard?&nbsp; Is Carol there?�

�I&#8217;m in my car.&nbsp; According to the GPS precisely 21.54 miles from my mountain cabin.&nbsp; Would you like latitude and longitude?&nbsp; And yes, your wife is here.�

�Let me talk to her.�

�She can hear you.&nbsp; All she has to do is speak.�

�Carol?�&nbsp; His agony carried across an ocean.

Finally, �Yes.�

�What are you doing?�

There was no answer.

�Stop,�&nbsp; pleaded Ross.&nbsp; Then to Brad, �Let her go.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
�She is not captive.&nbsp; I didn&#8217;t kidnap her.&nbsp; All she has to do is ask and I&#8217;ll stop.&nbsp; Though how she&#8217;ll get home is problematic.&nbsp; Tell him what you&#8217;re wearing.�

�Nothing.�

�That&#8217;s not quite true.�

�What?�

�Your wedding ring.�

�He&#8217;s right.&nbsp; I&#8217;m naked except for my wedding ring.&nbsp; He insisted i wear it.�

�Carol, don&#8217;t do this.&nbsp; I&#8217;m pleading with you.&nbsp; Please don&#8217;t do this.�

�It&#8217;s too late.�

Ross started to say something, but Brad cut in.&nbsp; �Wait.&nbsp; There&#8217;s an old filling station up ahead where they still pump gas.�&nbsp; Then to Carol, �No.&nbsp; I didn&#8217;t tell you to pull up your coat.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
�Carol?�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
�Forget it, Ross,�&nbsp; Brad continued.&nbsp; �At this very moment men are driving from all points of the compass to fuck your wife.&nbsp; East from San Diego.&nbsp; South from Los Angeles.&nbsp; West from Phoenix.&nbsp; North from El Centro. One guy might even fly down from Vegas.&nbsp; And you can&#8217;t do a thing about it.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
�We are going to trash your wife., Ross.&nbsp; Totally.&nbsp; If she isn&#8217;t fucked by more men this weekend than any other woman on the planet, she&#8217;ll come close.&nbsp;&nbsp; For the next thirty-six hours or so, whatever you are doing, know that there is a cock inside her. Or two or three.&nbsp; She probably doesn&#8217;t even know what being airtight means, but in less than an hour she will be. She is never going to be the same.&nbsp; And she knew that when she got in my car.&nbsp; I&#8217;ve never known anyone else&nbsp; move so willing toward her own destruction.&nbsp; We are going to baptize the new Carol in come.&nbsp; Full immersion.&nbsp; Glazed from the tip of her delicate toes to the top of her beautiful head.&nbsp; I&#8217;ll send you a picture.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
As he spoke the Lexis came around a tight curve and he slowed and&nbsp; pulled into a tiny two pump station surrounded by pine trees.&nbsp; A gangly teenager slouched out.&nbsp; Ross lowered his window and that on Carol&#8217;s side of the car.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Bored, the boy mumbled, �What can I do for you?�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
�Fill it with premium.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Carol was stiff.&nbsp; Frozen.&nbsp; Suddenly it did matter who saw her.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
The boy filled the tank, his mind a thousand miles away.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Coming back to Brad&#8217;s window, he said, �That&#8217;s $26.42.�&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Brad handed him a credit card, which he took into the shack that posed as an office, without looking into the car.&nbsp; But coming out with the receipt, his glance passed over Carol, moved on, then returned in a classic double-take.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
�What the hey?�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
His eyes were glued to her bare shoulders and breasts, and as he neared the car, the rest of her nakedness.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Beside Brad, he leaned down.&nbsp; �What&#8217;s going on?&nbsp; What&#8217;s with her?&nbsp; Are you all right, lady?�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
�Answer him.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
�I&#8217;m all right.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
�What&#8217;s going on?�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
�Tell him.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
�He&#8217;s taking me to be gangbanged and clothes are not necessary.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
�Are you serious?�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
�Yes.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
�Oh, man.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
�And what&#8217;s even better,� said Brad, �is that she&#8217;s married and her husband is listening.&nbsp; Aren&#8217;t you Ross?&nbsp; Ross?&nbsp; Well, maybe he hung up.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
�Can I take a picture,&nbsp; No one will ever believe this.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
How old are you?&nbsp; I don&#8217;t want to corrupt minors.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
�19.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
�O.K.&nbsp; No, not through here,� as the boy pulled out his cell phone. �Go around to her side.�&nbsp; And to Carol, �Open your door.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
The boy said, �You are the most beautiful woman I&#8217;ve ever seen.&nbsp; Is this really all right with you?�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
�Yes.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
He snapped a shot.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
�Turn toward him.&nbsp; Put your feet up on the seat.&nbsp; Spread the lips open.&nbsp; Let him see it all.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
�Amazing.&nbsp; Awesome.&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; Thank you.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
�Enough,� said Brad.&nbsp; 

And as they pulled away, �By tomorrow you&#8217;ll be an Internet star.�









WORLDS APART

by

W. L. Telford

5


On the Interstate Carol&#8217;s mind had drifted, but exposing herself to the boy, and the bulge tenting his jeans, brought her back to the present.&nbsp; That must hurt, she thought.&nbsp; 

She half-turned toward Brad, leaned against the door, and raised her left foot onto the seat, leaving the other on the floor, knees far apart, her wet cunt toward him.&nbsp; �How much farther?�

He glanced at her and grinned.&nbsp; �It glistens.&nbsp; Can&#8217;t wait?&nbsp; Won&#8217;t be long.&nbsp; Ten minutes.�&nbsp; When his right hand moved from the steering wheel to her thigh, she could not quite stifle an inarticulate sound.&nbsp; The first of many she would make that night.

Forest broken by a few scattered farm houses and cottages in starlight.&nbsp; She closed her eyes, opening them again when his hand left her for the steering wheel as he turned onto a gravel driveway, which climbed almost a quarter mile up to what he called a cabin, but was a modern multi-story house.&nbsp; A sensor automatically turned on lights both inside and on a deck as the Lexis came to a stop.&nbsp; The sides of the house were wood; the front all glass.

�I own the hill,�&nbsp; he said.&nbsp; �No neighbors in sight or sound.&nbsp; You can scream all you want.&nbsp; Leave the coat.�&nbsp; And this time he didn&#8217;t help her with her door.

Instead he opened the trunk, removed what looked like two duffle bags, and carried them across the deck to a sliding glass door.&nbsp; Awkwardly in the darkness and her heels, goose bumps on naked skin, she followed.&nbsp; There was plenty of room for parking, she noticed.

�Leave your shoes,� he said as he opened the door.&nbsp; �To welcome the others.�

Barefoot she followed him into the living area, which rose to the full 30&#8217; height of the house.&nbsp; A kitchen was beneath a balcony that she supposed lead to bedrooms.&nbsp; A huge stone fireplace filled one end wall.

One of the bags contained a self-inflating mattress.&nbsp; She sat on an ivory colored leather sofa as he set it up.&nbsp;&nbsp; �I doubt you&#8217;ll remain here long, but it&#8217;s a place to start.&nbsp; Have you had a drink today?�

�A martini.&nbsp; Hours ago.�

He went across to a cabinet and then to the kitchen area, returning with two glasses, handing her one.&nbsp; �A weak gin and tonic,� he said, and sat down beside her, his clothed leg touching her naked one.

�Your guests should start arriving soon.&nbsp; Oh, I almost forgot.�&nbsp; And he got up and went to the other bag, which was still by the door. 

�Time to mount your thrown.&nbsp; Hands and knees.&nbsp; Doggie.�&nbsp; 

Her momentary pleasure at the thought that he was going to fuck her&nbsp; ended when she felt a nozzle press against her anus and gel squirt inside.

�After the first few, you&#8217;ll loosen up and there will be plenty of come to lubricate, but we don&#8217;t want you to tear at the very start.�

She was disappointed when he returned to the sofa.

�Don&#8217;t you want me?�

He laughed.&nbsp; �In time, babe.&nbsp; But I want you to be aware that you are the kind of girl who spreads her legs for total strangers.&nbsp; And that&#8217;s just what I want you to do.&nbsp; When you hear that first car coming up the drive, I want you on your back, juicy cunt pointing at the door, legs spread in the widest V you can manage, feet in the air.&nbsp; Then I want you to beg whoever it is to fuck you and make you come.&nbsp; In fact, get that way now.�

Taking a camera from his pocket, he walked around the mattress.&nbsp; 
�Raise your head.&nbsp; Look at me.&nbsp; Smile.�&nbsp; The flash went off several times.&nbsp;&nbsp; 

� &#8216;Before&#8217; shots.&nbsp; To be compared with &#8216;after&#8217;.�&nbsp; 

Her hand jerked at the sound of an engine.&nbsp; Ice cubes rattled in the glass.&nbsp; Brad reached for it.&nbsp; She took a deep gulp.&nbsp; �Assume the position.&nbsp; You lover approaches.&nbsp; I wonder who it is?&nbsp; Don&#8217;t you?&nbsp; But then you don&#8217;t know any of them.�

&#8216;V&#8217;ing her legs, she let her head fall back onto the mattress.&nbsp; Her eyes&nbsp; fixed on lights built into the ceiling far above her.&nbsp; She felt her body trembling.&nbsp; She wanted to run.&nbsp; But there was no place to run.&nbsp; And she didn&#8217;t really want to run.&nbsp; She wanted to be right where she was.&nbsp; She had placed herself there.&nbsp; But she wanted it to begin.&nbsp; A car door slammed.&nbsp; Men&#8217;s voices.&nbsp; More than one, but she couldn&#8217;t tell how many.&nbsp; Steps on the gravel; then the deck.

One voice, �Nice shoes.�

Another, �Hey, Brad.&#8217;

And a third,&nbsp; �V&#8217; for victory.�

She raised her head and saw three men, one probably in his twenties, the other two around her own age.&nbsp; Average looking guys.&nbsp; The kind she saw every day and didn&#8217;t really notice.&nbsp; Just guys.&nbsp;&nbsp; Two were wearing jeans and t-shirts, the other slacks and a short-sleeved Hawaiian print.&nbsp; �Please fuck me,� she begged.&nbsp; �Please fuck me and make me come.�

�All right!�&nbsp; And they gave high fives.

�Only one at a time at first,� said Brad.&nbsp; �And in her cunt.�

They started to argue.

Brad said, �First one undressed goes first.�

Carol let her head fall back, but she heard the hurried sounds.&nbsp; Then a triumphant, �I won.�&nbsp; �Shit.�&nbsp; Followed almost instantly by a body falling on her, knocking the breath from her lungs.&nbsp; A hard cock slid easily past her outer lips and buried itself.&nbsp; No foreplay.&nbsp; The entire week had been foreplay.

It was the youngest one.&nbsp; He had brown hair and his breath smelled of beer.&nbsp; The irrelevant thought passed through her mind that she didn&#8217;t know his name or if Brad had told him hers.&nbsp; Names?&nbsp; When his cock felt so good.&nbsp; Her legs were pushed back toward her ears by his shoulders.&nbsp; She was almost bent in two.&nbsp; Bracing himself on his hands and toes, his body straight, he pounded her hard and fast.&nbsp; 

�Oh God.&nbsp; Oh God.&nbsp; Oh God.�&nbsp; She chanted, ever louder until she went over.&nbsp; �Aaagggh!�&nbsp; Flopping beneath him like a hooked fish, she felt him flood her cunt.

�Come on,�&nbsp; a voice said.&nbsp; �Get out of the way.�

Post-orgasm, she needed time to recover.&nbsp; But there was no time.&nbsp; Another body fell on her.&nbsp; Another cock slammed in and begin pumping in and out.&nbsp; And she found she didn&#8217;t need time.&nbsp; Already she was building toward another orgasm.&nbsp; It built and built.&nbsp; But this guy shouted and shuttered and came too soon.&nbsp; She had barely started to descend when a third body pressed her down.&nbsp; Were there more voices?&nbsp; She hadn&#8217;t heard other cars.&nbsp; But then she was already half out of her mind and her screams could have drowned out an ambulance.

A face above her.&nbsp; Lips pulled back in animal grimace.&nbsp; Forth of spittle.&nbsp; A face of pain or hate or ecstasy.&nbsp; Or all three.&nbsp; She didn&#8217;t care.&nbsp;&nbsp; She gasped the words aloud in rhythm to his thrusts.&nbsp; �I don&#8217;t care.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t care.� 

Carol Edwards shuttered to her second orgasm as she felt herself being filled with semen for the third time.&nbsp;&nbsp; A weight on the mattress near her head.&nbsp; She turned.&nbsp; A spongy cock shiny with pre-come shoved into her mouth.&nbsp; Another into her cunt.&nbsp; And she--and everyone else--lost count.

Faces came and faces went.&nbsp; Laughing.&nbsp; Sneering.&nbsp; Gasping.&nbsp; Groaning.&nbsp; Sweat fell from them onto her.&nbsp; Brown hair.&nbsp; Blond.&nbsp; Gray.&nbsp; Bald.&nbsp; Cocks filled her cunt and mouth.&nbsp; Spewed.&nbsp; Softened.&nbsp; Withdrew.&nbsp; Were replaced.&nbsp; Mostly white faces; but a few Hispanic and black.&nbsp; She tasted the differences between the first few loads in her mouth, and then like cheap wine, it all began to taste the same.&nbsp; A pubic hair caught in her throat.&nbsp; She choked.&nbsp; A flood of semen washed it down.

The house had filled with men.&nbsp; She heard snatches of conversation.

�Great looking piece.�

�Yeah.&nbsp; Brad said she was, but better than I expected.&nbsp; Wonder why she&#8217;s doing this.&nbsp; She wouldn&#8217;t have any trouble finding someone to fuck her.�

�

�What&#8217;s the slut&#8217;s name?�

�Donn known.&nbsp; Donn care.&nbsp; Fuck meat.�

�Hey, Brad, what&#8217;s the slut&#8217;s name?

�Carol.&nbsp; Carol Edwards.�

�

�Is that ring for real?�

�Yeah.�

�So where&#8217;s her husband?

�Somewhere.&nbsp; Asia.&nbsp; Australia.&nbsp; Somewhere over there.�

�Man, if that were mine, I&#8217;d be home nailing it to the mattress every night.�

�

�Where&#8217;d Brad find her?�

�Some charity thing, I think.�

�I&#8217;d donate.�

�

�No.&nbsp; You go next.&nbsp; I&#8217;m waiting for that fine ass.�

�Brad.&nbsp; Brad.&nbsp; When you going to open the other holes?�

�

A familiar face.&nbsp; She knew this face, but couldn&#8217;t place it.&nbsp; Then, of course:&nbsp; it was Brad.&nbsp; Her lips wrapped around a cock, sucking, she could only see him intermittently, until the cock came and she swallowed.

Brad&#8217;s cock slipped into her swamped cunt.&nbsp; There was so much come, she could hardly feel it. His full weigh came down on her.&nbsp; His hands gripped her ass as he rolled onto his back, keeping his cock lodged in her cunt, before moving his hands to each side of her head, fingers twining in cum streaked hair.&nbsp; Locking her face a few inches above his.

�I want to watch this in your eyes,� he said.

Why?&nbsp; she wondered, already dazed and confused.&nbsp; What&#8217;s going to happen?&nbsp; Until other hands spread her ass.&nbsp; �Ohhh,�&nbsp; she screamed.&nbsp; �No.�&nbsp;&nbsp; Her anus displaced and partially blocked by Brad&#8217;s cock in her cunt, resisted being forced open.&nbsp; Below her Brad saw her green eyes widen in pain and disbelief as it was breached.&nbsp; Two cocks buried completely within her.&nbsp; She had never felt so full.&nbsp; They began to move, separated only by a thin membrane of flesh.&nbsp; �You&#8217;re going to rip me in two,� she tried to protest, but was cut short by a third cock plunging into her mouth.&nbsp; Airtight, she thought.&nbsp; So this is what he meant.&nbsp;&nbsp; And the crowd went wild.

Cheers.&nbsp; Shouts.&nbsp; Applause.&nbsp;&nbsp; �Give it to the cunt.�&nbsp; �Fuck her.&nbsp; Fuck her.&nbsp; Fuck her.�&nbsp; �I&#8217;ve got the asshole next.�&nbsp; �Mouth.�&nbsp; �Cunt.�&nbsp; �Form lines.�

Words and sounds reached Carol only dimly.&nbsp; She was stuffed, skewered, impaled.&nbsp; Yet she couldn&#8217;t multitask. The cocks ramming into her did not blend.&nbsp; Each was distinct.&nbsp; 

Her mind focused on one then another.&nbsp; At one moment she felt the veins in the cock with her tongue.&nbsp;&nbsp; Then her nipples dragging over Brad&#8217;s chest.&nbsp; Each hair.&nbsp; Then the fingers of a man she had not yet seen digging into her ass.

A pain in her neck as the cock in her mouth forced her head back.&nbsp; 

Brad and the man in her ass settled into a rhythm:&nbsp; one thrusting in, while the other pulled out.&nbsp; But she screamed as they lost it and both plunged in at the same time, all but drilling completely through her and meeting in her gut.

Her cunt had already been stretched and was too loose, and her over stimulated clit almost hurt.&nbsp; She didn&#8217;t think she could come again.

The cock in her mouth was enlarging, swelling with blood and come.&nbsp; She tightened her lips and sucked, and it spewed.&nbsp; Brad saw her throat swallow.&nbsp; And the sight made him come.&nbsp; As he forced his hips up, they forced her ass back onto the third cock, which drill deep, causing it to come.&nbsp; Carol&#8217;s mind whiled from one to another to another in an endless circle.&nbsp; I&#8217;m flooded, she thought.
She collapsed onto Brad, her breasts flattening against his chest.

�No,� she heard him say, as new cocks approached her.&nbsp; �I want to glaze her first, now while she is still at least partially aware of what&#8217;s happening.�

Groans.

He rolled her off to the side.&nbsp; �You&#8217;ll all have plenty of time to recover and come again.&nbsp; But we&#8217;re going to do this now.�&nbsp; Then to Carol, �Roll onto your stomach.�

She did and lay there, spent, eyes closed.

�All right.&nbsp; Everyone around the mattress.&nbsp; Jamie and Bill just came and are excused.&nbsp; But everyone else.&nbsp; No exceptions.�

Some of the men were naked; some dressed.&nbsp; Most had glasses or bottles that they had to set down to free their hands.

Zippers.&nbsp; Labored breathing. Stroking.&nbsp; Something splattered against her shoulder blade.

�Wipe it off in her hair.�

A wet cock against her skull.

Spatter on the soles of her feet.&nbsp; Then more quickly, volleys on her ass, the backs of her thighs, her spine.&nbsp; Everywhere.

�That&#8217;s enough for this side.&nbsp; Anyone volunteer to rub it in?&nbsp; I&#8217;ve got some rubber gloves.�

Hands moved over her skin.&nbsp; �Cover every inch.&nbsp; Between her toes.&nbsp; Lift her hair and get the back of her neck.&nbsp; Inside her ears.�&nbsp; A camera flashed.&nbsp; �No.&nbsp; Only me.&nbsp; There are guys here who don&#8217;t want to be seen.&nbsp; I&#8217;ll email all of you copies that don&#8217;t show any faces except hers.�

�Onto your back.�

When Carol didn&#8217;t move, a hand slapped her ass.

�Wha...What?�

�Roll over.�

She did. &#8232;&#8232;�Arms out. Legs apart.&nbsp; O.K.�

A hot sticky rain.&nbsp; Some thick.&nbsp; Some watery.&nbsp; In gushers and in droplets.&nbsp; On her feet and legs and belly and arms and hands and breasts and throat and face.&nbsp; Cock after cock erupting, then being wiped on her face or in her clotted hair.

�She can spread it out on this side herself.�&nbsp; 

Carol opened her eyes.&nbsp; Come slipped into them and blinded her.&nbsp; 

�You don&#8217;t need to see.&nbsp; Just reach down and coat yourself.�

�My eyes sting.�

�We&#8217;ll clean you up when you&#8217;re finished.�

Keeping her eyes squeezed closed, she sat up and reached down for her feet.&nbsp; Her fingers recoiled, then spread the slippery substance.&nbsp; Over her ankles, working their way up.&nbsp; It was, she thought, like applying suntan lotion.&nbsp; And it wasn&#8217;t.&nbsp; It was not suntan lotion beneath her fingers, but come.&nbsp; The come of she did not even know how many men.&nbsp; Strangers.&nbsp; She had never even imagined such a thing.&nbsp; She did not know the time.&nbsp; Had it been one hour or three?&nbsp; Whatever, she had already been fucked that night by many more men than in the first 35 years of her life.&nbsp; And it had only just begun.

�Don&#8217;t miss your armpits.�

Her nipples responded to her hands.&nbsp; She covered her throat.&nbsp; Spread come across her cheeks and lips, nose and forehead.

�I think that&#8217;s got it.&nbsp; You can lie back.�

Camera flash penetrated her eyelids.&nbsp; Brad was right, she thought and understood perhaps for the first time,&nbsp; this night really is life altering.&nbsp; She imagined the pores of her skin as large as if under a microscope, come pouring through them into her.&nbsp; She would never be able to fully wipe it off.&nbsp; The image, the memory indelible.&nbsp; I will never be the same.&nbsp; What must I look like? she wondered.&nbsp; It would be a few days before she saw the inhuman answer.

�


Led to a shower, washed, dried, led back to the wiped down mattress, her body ever weaker, her nerve ends numbing.&nbsp; �I can&#8217;t,� she mumbled as her thigh muscles gave out while she was riding one man with another in her ass.&nbsp; So they fucked her yielding flesh themselves.

Ever more dimly she felt hands pulling and pushing her yielding body, arranging and rearranging it&nbsp; as they wished.&nbsp; Face up.&nbsp; Face down.&nbsp; On her side.&nbsp; Almost always two or three cocks in her.&nbsp; Her throat hurt.&nbsp; Too many cocks and too many screams.&nbsp; She lost her voice.

Men sat and stood, watching, the frenzied smells and sounds of sex filling the night, waiting for an opening.&nbsp; Some left.&nbsp; New ones arrived.&nbsp; Some stayed for seconds and thirds.

...

Brad Tomalin&#8217;s cellphone rang.

�Hello, Ross.&nbsp; What is it, Saturday afternoon there?�

I missed that.&nbsp; Too noisy.�

To Ross Edwards it sounded as though he were calling a sports bar during a big game.

�I want to talk to Carol.�

�A good one, Ross.&nbsp; She&#8217;s more than a little occupied at the moment.&nbsp; And will be for many moments and hours to come.&nbsp; I&#8217;ll send you some pictures.&nbsp; Just a second I&#8217;ll take one now.�

�I&#8217;m going to come back there and kill you.�

�When?�

�When is this going to end?�

�Sometime Sunday morning.&nbsp; Around thirty more hours and I have no idea how many more men.&nbsp; Didn&#8217;t Carol say you were going to Shanghai?&nbsp; Got to keep your mind on business, man.&nbsp;&nbsp; Hey, Willie, get off her face for a minute and let the slut say hi to her husband.�

Brad walked over to the mattress and held out the phone.&nbsp; 

On the other end, Ross heard only a low kneeing.

...


The emailed image arrived a few minutes later.

He could not see much of his wife.&nbsp; One foot in the air beside a man&#8217;s butt.&nbsp; He was shocked at the toenail polish.&nbsp; Part of a shoulder and arm.&nbsp; The rest was hidden by men&#8217;s naked bodies.&nbsp; Ross couldn&#8217;t tell how many or exactly what they were doing to her.&nbsp; One, presumably &#8216;Willie&#8217; was sitting on her face, but what part of him was directly over her mouth was unclear.&nbsp; Was his cock in her mouth or her tongue up his ass?

�The bitch,� Ross said aloud, as against his will he felt his cock harden.&nbsp; �The fucking bitch.�

Single malt scotch is a drink of peat fires and cold seas, not the Equator, but air conditioning can make Singapore cool enough; and while his wife was being fucked to oblivion, Ross Edwards tried to drink his way there.&nbsp; The difference was that she succeeded.

Ross was not usually a heavy drinker.&nbsp; A martini in the evening; a pitcher of margaritas on past happy San Diego weekends with Carol; wine with diner.&nbsp; He seldom drank during the day; and he couldn&#8217;t remember the last time he was truly drunk.&nbsp; But after staring for several minutes at that photo of men on his wife like a pride of lions devouring a kill, her kneeing sound echoing in his mind, he opened a bottle of Lagavulin, distilled on a small island off the Scotland coast a world away.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Lagavulin is rich, flavorful, strong; but it didn&#8217;t work.&nbsp;&nbsp; At least not completely.&nbsp; Images of Carol&#8217;s plundered body hazed, but they did not vanish.&nbsp; Every minute, minute after minute, hour after hour, as he filled and drained and refilled his glass, helpless, he knew that a cock, cocks, were in her.&nbsp; Rending.&nbsp; Filling.&nbsp; Coming.&nbsp; Taking pleasure.&nbsp; It was abominable.&nbsp; It was impossible.&nbsp; It was true.

From what he could see in the photograph she had been on her back.&nbsp; That foot.&nbsp;&nbsp; That vulnerable, well-formed foot.&nbsp; He had never seen such vivid polish on her toenails.&nbsp; Her applying it.&nbsp; Preparing herself for animals.

Clumsily he tore off his clothes, fell back into an armchair naked as he knew she was naked, and began furiously jerking his cock.

Despite the alcohol he was excruciatingly hard.&nbsp; He saw them fucking her. Fucking.&nbsp; Turning her body, fine-boned, full breasted--he remembered the first time he saw them, touched them, kissed those dark nipples.&nbsp;&nbsp; Hands.&nbsp; A sea of hands.&nbsp; Turning her this way and that to suit their pleasure.&nbsp; Over, onto her knees, spreading her ass.&nbsp; Mashing her breasts.&nbsp;&nbsp; Twisting her nipples.&nbsp; He saw her cry out, a cry muffled by a cock shoving between cum slick lips.&nbsp; He saw the men&#8217;s bodies jerk and spasm.&nbsp; Spasm.&nbsp; Spasm.&nbsp; And he did himself.&nbsp; Sex had obsessed his mind for days, ever since that first devastating email.&nbsp; 
Semen spurted out, up, arched in the air, splashed back onto his hand and belly.&nbsp; It kept pouring out, as he knew it was pouring into his wife.&nbsp; Pouring.&nbsp; Even when it stopped, his cock remained hard.

A come covered hand reached unsteadily for another glass of amber liquid.

...

Half a bottle of Lagavulin brought poisoned sleep.&nbsp; Sleep filled with Carol.&nbsp; Laughing.&nbsp; Smiling.&nbsp; The moment he first saw her on the Stanford campus when she was working on her masters in architecture and he on his MBA.&nbsp; The breathtaking moment he first saw her naked.&nbsp; Writhing naked beneath a mass of men.&nbsp; Screaming.&nbsp; In orgasm or pain.&nbsp; Even in shallow, troubled sleep his mind was aware that she was being fucked by man after man.&nbsp; He hoped her screams were of pain.&nbsp; He hoped they were hurting her.&nbsp; She deserved to be hurt. 

His cock was so hard it hurt and woke him.

The room was dark.&nbsp; Night had fallen.&nbsp; He glanced at his watch, but the numbers blurred.&nbsp; He reached for the bottle, but in mid-motion changed direction and grabbed his cock instead.&nbsp; Strangers were taking pleasure from his wife, and he had only his hand.

�

Daylight.&nbsp; 

On the third try, he managed to open his eyes.&nbsp; His head was being beaten with a hammer.&nbsp; His tongue was thick.&nbsp; A dried crust on his hand and cock and belly.&nbsp; He smelled of sweat and sex.&nbsp; For a moment he thought he was going to vomit.&nbsp; He bent down.&nbsp; His head between his knees.&nbsp; The moment passed.&nbsp; He straightened and clumsily brought his left arm to his face and peered at his watch.&nbsp; 9:35&nbsp; Sunday morning.&nbsp; He tried to figure out the time in California, but couldn&#8217;t subtract 15.&nbsp; Still Saturday though.&nbsp; Toward evening.&nbsp; She was entering her second exhausting night.

He hated her.&nbsp; Hated her as he had never hated anyone or anything.&nbsp; And at the same time, perhaps because of that hatred, he wanted her as much, more, than he ever had.&nbsp; She could deny him nothing now.&nbsp; He could use her any way he wanted.&nbsp; Everyone else had fucked the ass that she had so seldom and reluctantly given to him.&nbsp; It hurts, she said.&nbsp; I&#8217;ll show you hurt, he thought.&nbsp; I&#8217;ll shove it so far up your slut ass you choke.

His stomach spasmed, and he stumbled to the bathroom.

�

He showered.&nbsp; Carol was being fucked.

He shaved.&nbsp; Gargled with mouthwash.&nbsp; Brushed his teeth.&nbsp; Carol was being fucked.&nbsp; 

He made a cup of coffee and sipped it tentatively.&nbsp; Uncertain if it would stay down.&nbsp; 

Slowly he packed his suitcase, called for a taxi, rode to Changi Airport for the five hour flight to Shanghai.&nbsp; Glancing out the window at the passing traffic, he saw Carol being fucked.

In the Singapore Airlines VIP lounge he dared to sip a gin and tonic.&nbsp; It did some good.&nbsp;&nbsp; Helped settle his stomach. The ringing in his ears went down a tone.&nbsp; The throbbing in his head slowed.&nbsp; He took another sip and looked around the room.&nbsp; She had been fucked by many more men than this.&nbsp; He wondered who was in her at that very minute.&nbsp; What he was doing to her.&nbsp; How he was using her.&nbsp; Ross could not endure this.&nbsp; No man could.&nbsp; He made the mistake of taking a gulp of his drink.

�

Three hours later and six miles above the South China Sea, a flight attendant in first class bent over to pick up a magazine, causing her uniform skirt momentarily to stretch tight across her hips.

She did not really look like Carol.&nbsp; She was merely pretty, not beautiful.&nbsp; But she was about the same height, and had the same light brown almost blond shoulder length hair.&nbsp; And good legs and ankles.&nbsp; From her accent Ross surmised that she was Australian.
When she straightened he noticed her wedding ring.&nbsp; 

 An almost overwhelming urge flooded over him.&nbsp; He wanted to hurt her.&nbsp; He wanted to fuck her until her eyes bulged.&nbsp; He wanted to make her scream.&nbsp; He wanted to do to her what was endlessly being done to Carol.&nbsp; He wanted to humiliate her husband.&nbsp; Tie him naked to a chair and make him watch.&nbsp;&nbsp; He wanted to do to others what was being done to him.

Chrysalis.&nbsp; 

The camera flash reflecting off the sheen of come coating her body made it appear solid and hard.&nbsp; I look like a chrysalis, Carol thought.&nbsp;&nbsp; A new life form waiting to be born.&nbsp; But whatever has emerged, whatever I have become, is most definitely not a butterfly.

The picture, along with dozens of others, was in an online gallery.&nbsp; Even though it was password protected, she felt uneasy.&nbsp; She had no idea how many people Brad had given the password to, or how many others they would share it with.&nbsp; Knowing that evidence of the weekend would endure forever in cyberspace was somehow worse than having no idea how many men had actually used her.&nbsp; By Saturday dawn she had become insensible and had no more memory of what had happened after that than a woman given Rohypnol.

The link to the gallery arrived in an email Tuesday evening with a subject line:&nbsp; what I did last weekend.&nbsp; 

She had followed Brad&#8217;s advice to put in for a few day&#8217;s vacation time in advance, and was only now beginning to feel human again.&nbsp; If I am human, she reminded herself.

She was bruised and battered inside and out.&nbsp; Brad had kept his word that she would not be seriously injured; but she had been hard used.&nbsp; Her breasts, her ass, her thighs, her arms bore blue-purple finger prints.&nbsp; Every part of her ached.&nbsp; Her cunt and ass and mouth and throat were sore.&nbsp; Her hair was sore.&nbsp; Urinating almost made her cry.

Photograph after photograph of men she had never seen.&nbsp; Only the first few seemed vaguely familiar.&nbsp; And Brad, who from the evidence had taken her at least a half dozen times.&nbsp; And one or two others.&nbsp; A huge Spanish speaking man with an enormous cock who make her scream.&nbsp; And a weasel spitting in her face.

That is why my throat hurts, she thought, as she flicked though a series depicting her with her nose flattened against men&#8217;s groins.&nbsp; Brad said I&#8217;d learn to deep throat.

The last two images were &#8216;before&#8217; and &#8216;after.&#8217;

There she was beautiful, smiling&nbsp; at the camera through the V of her legs.&nbsp; Hair clean and soft.&nbsp; Lipstick smooth.&nbsp; Skin unmarked.&nbsp; The almost childlike slit of her shaved cunt pencil line closed.&nbsp; Her puckered anus tight.

And there was someone, something.&nbsp; A discarded rag doll.&nbsp; Sprawled.&nbsp; Eyes staring vacantly.&nbsp; Hair matted.&nbsp; Mouth slack.&nbsp; Arms and legs akimbo.&nbsp; Flesh bruised.&nbsp; Flaccid.&nbsp; Like a melted candle.&nbsp; Cunt and ass gaping wide.&nbsp; Pools of come inside both.&nbsp; Streams of come draining out.

There was a second link in Brad&#8217;s email.&nbsp; This to a site that purported to contain amateur porn.&nbsp; It did not require a password.&nbsp;&nbsp; Halfway down a page of thumbnails, she saw the photo the filling station attendant had taken.&nbsp; She clicked and it enlarged.&nbsp; The incongruity of her nakedness framed by the open car door made it even more obscene, as did her smile as she held her cunt open for the camera and the world.&nbsp; The picture was in sharp focus.&nbsp;&nbsp; She was unmistakably recognizable.

A cold wave broke over her.&nbsp; Anyone might see this.&nbsp; Her father.&nbsp; She flashed on her father&#8217;s shock at discovering that his good daughter was a shameless slut.&nbsp; Could he prevent himself staring at her cunt like any other man?&nbsp; Would he even want to?&nbsp; People at the office.&nbsp; Friends.&nbsp; Long forgotten high school classmates.&nbsp; Teachers.&nbsp; Neighbors.

The only email text:&nbsp; I told you, baby, I&#8217;d make you a star.

�

The email reached Ross Edwards between meetings in Tokyo Wednesday morning.&nbsp; It contained the same two links his wife was viewing, but the subject was:&nbsp; your wife and your brain.&nbsp; The text:&nbsp; I&#8217;m fucking both.&nbsp; And a .jpeg was attached.

With a mixture of apprehension and sexual anticipation, Ross opened&nbsp; the image, quickly followed by a perplexed, �What the hell?�&nbsp; 

He couldn&#8217;t figure out what he was looking at.

An enormous irregular circle filled his MacBook Air.&nbsp; On the screen it was seven inches in diameter, touching the top and bottom of the screen and leaving little blotchy space on the sides.

At first it looked like a crater on the Moon.&nbsp; Then a tunnel.&nbsp; The mouth of a cave.&nbsp; An open manhole.

�My god.�&nbsp; That was it.&nbsp; �My god,� Ross repeated in soft disbelief as he realized he was looking straight up his wife&#8217;s asshole.

The blades of the disposable razor moved carefully over tenderized mons, then down labia and around anus, removing five days� stubble.&nbsp; She didn�t expect anyone would see, but shaving seemed the right thing to do.&nbsp; 

Even the slight pressure of the razor was painful.&nbsp; A cock in her cunt or ass would be excruciating.&nbsp; Yet as she touched her body, she remembered how full she had been, and now she was empty.&nbsp; A hollowness waiting to be filled:&nbsp; the first nascent erotic thought of her rebirth. 

She removed chipped polish from her fingers and toes and
went back to work.

The firm was located in a converted warehouse in the Gaslamp Quarter and had just over one hundred employees, forty of whom were architects.&nbsp; Carol was on a first name basis with them all, and they all greeted her with the standard polite questions about her days off, without really seeing her or hearing her replies.&nbsp; Only the founding principal and Carol�s boss, Rik Cronin, looked at her carefully--but then he always looked at her carefully--and asked,&nbsp; �Are you ill?&nbsp;&nbsp; You look tired.�

�I�m fine.�&nbsp; She forced a smile.&nbsp; �I didn�t sleep as well in the mountains as I expected.�

�Sometimes vacations are more tiring than work.�

�That�s true.�

If only he knew, she thought, and continued on to her office.

Carefully skirting any act or word that could be legally construed as sexual harassment, Rik had let her know several years ago that he found her attractive, and since Ross had moved to Singapore increasingly found excuses to invite her to �business� lunches in which he let his eyes wander a little too openly and his hands brush against her, accidentally of course, a little too frequently.&nbsp; 

Fiftyish, paunchy, married, he was never anyone Carol would have become involved with.&nbsp; But then, she realized, he isn�t any worse than dozens of men who fucked me last weekend.

She was the lead architect on a new research center being built on Torrey Mesa near the UCSD campus and it was good to turn her mind from herself and become absorbed in the details of the project.&nbsp; Yet sometimes when she moved in her chair, or stood, or walked to a conference room or someone else�s office or cubicle, something shifted inside her, bringing discomfort and memory.

As she drove home and made herself a martini that evening, she again felt empty.&nbsp; Increasingly.&nbsp; I need it, she thought.&nbsp; I am one sick bitch.&nbsp; I need it even if it hurts.&nbsp; And then an unexpected thought:&nbsp; especially if it hurts.

�

A day passed.&nbsp; 

There are no books on post gangbang etiquette, but he should have called me by now, Carol thought.&nbsp; It had been four days of silence since Brad poured her into her bed.&nbsp; He should have checked to see if I�m all right.&nbsp; Whatever happens, the world will come to an end before I call him.

Another day passed.

She had just returned to her desk from a meeting when the phone rang.

�Hello.�

�My office.&nbsp; Noon.�

Without waiting for a response, he hung up.

�

Tomalin Enterprises occupied two floors of a high rise building only&nbsp; a few blocks away, but she did not feel like walking, so she drove.&nbsp; 

Riding the elevator up from underground parking to the thirty-first floor again, her stomach fluttered.&nbsp; What is wrong with me?, she wondered.&nbsp; I�m hardly some teenager on a first date.

Expecting to be shown right in, Carol was nonplussed when his assistant, a silver haired, stylish dressed woman stopped her with, �He�s just finishing up a meeting.&nbsp; Won�t be more than a few minutes.�

Carol sat on a sofa across from the woman�s desk and the wall of solid wood panelling to Brad�s office.&nbsp; She must have spoken to the woman before--was it really only a little over a week?--but had been in such a state that she had no recollection.&nbsp; The name plate on the desk read Amanda Black.

Carol started when the double doors to Brad�s office opened.&nbsp; Three men came out.&nbsp; One of them grinned at her knowingly as he passed.

Brad stood waiting.&nbsp; She walked into the office, then stopped uncertain.

Closing the doors, he crossed the room and sat in one of the armchairs.&nbsp; After straightening the crease in his trousers, he said, �Let�s see it.�

That�s what he said before:&nbsp; �Show it to me.�&nbsp; It.&nbsp; What did I expect--tenderness?

He didn�t speak again until she was naked.&nbsp; 

�My.&nbsp; My.�&nbsp; Then, �Turn around.&nbsp; Slowly.�

With her back to him, she was looking out the glass side of the building&nbsp; south across the bay and Coronado to Mexico and the Pacific Ocean.

�Come over here.�

When she was standing in front of him, �Closer.�&nbsp; He parted his legs and she knew to drop to her knees.

She winced when he reached for her breasts, but he only cupped them, letting their weight rest in his palms.

�Take it out.�

Leaning forward she fumbled with his zipper.&nbsp; He had to lean back and help her.&nbsp; His cock sprung free.&nbsp;&nbsp; Pre-come leaking from the tip pleased her.&nbsp; He is not as cold and detached as he acts, Carol thought.&nbsp; Aroused by the proof he wanted her and by the thought of being naked before him--I�m always naked in this office, she thought.&nbsp; And I always will be.&nbsp; There is no other reason for me to be here-- she wrapped her hand around the shaft.&nbsp; It was too big.&nbsp; She wanted it; but it would hurt too much.&nbsp; �I�m very sore.&nbsp; Please be gentle.�

�I�m not going to fuck you.�

�No?�&nbsp; 

�No.&nbsp; You�re just here to give me a blowjob.�

She caught the �just.�&nbsp; A delivery girl.&nbsp; A commodity.&nbsp; Like ordering a pizza or sandwiches to be sent in for lunch.&nbsp; Today I think I�ll have a blowjob.

She felt herself become wetter at the thought of being a call girl used merely to serve his pleasure.&nbsp; Too bad.&nbsp; I don�t care if I leak all over his carpet.&nbsp; And she bent and licked the salty pre-come from the tip of his cock before engulfing it with her mouth.

In silence broken only by the wet sounds of her lips sliding up and down, only his hard flesh told her he was excited .&nbsp; He could have been reading a newspaper or looking at a computer screen--and the time would come when he would be--until finally he said, �Lick my balls.�

�That�s good.&nbsp; Now suck one into your mouth.&nbsp; Keep stroking my cock with your hand...Now the other.&nbsp; That�s good.&nbsp; Run your tongue from the base of my cock to the tip.&nbsp; Open the hole.&nbsp; Lick there.&nbsp; Down again.�

His hands left her breasts and moved to each side of her head.

�I want you to take it all.&nbsp; We know you can.�

�My throat is sore,� she protested.

�I expect it is.�&nbsp;&nbsp; He pulled her face down.

When the tip touched something in the back of her mouth, she&nbsp; winced, gagged, and instinctively tried to pull away.&nbsp;&nbsp; His hands were too strong.&nbsp; Even as she struggled futilely, she responded to being overpowered by that strength.&nbsp; �Open your throat and relax.&nbsp; This is going to happen.�&nbsp; And it did.&nbsp; The glans of his cock slipped past a final obstacle and her lips touched public hair.&nbsp; 

He held her there motionless.&nbsp; She could not breathe, but he didn�t care.&nbsp; Or perhaps he did and that is exactly what he wants, Carol thought.&nbsp; �Move your tongue.�&nbsp; She tried.&nbsp; Apparently it was enough.&nbsp; �Good.�&nbsp; And slowly he let her head rise until his cock slipped out and she gasped for air.&nbsp; �Again.�&nbsp; Before she had fully regained breath, he pulled her all the way down.

This time he held her even longer and she fought her impulse to struggle until he finally let her up. 

�You were drooling on my pants.� 

Gasping.&nbsp; �I...I thought I was...going to pass out.&nbsp; Would you��

�Have let that happen?&nbsp; Maybe.&nbsp; I want you to know how totally I own you.&nbsp; Even the air you breath.&nbsp; Now suck.&nbsp; I�m not through yet.�

Dutifully she bent forward.&nbsp; �Tighten your lips and actually suck.&nbsp; Let me feel more tongue.&nbsp; Caress my balls with your hand.&nbsp; That�s good.&nbsp; Take it a little deeper.&nbsp; You don�t have to go all the way down.&nbsp; Good.&nbsp; Good.&nbsp; Keep that rhythm.�

Sucking, bobbing head.&nbsp; Heavy breasts swaying.&nbsp; The weave of the carpet against knees. 
 
�I was going to send a photo to your husband, but I�ve decided not to.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This one will just between us.&nbsp; I like the idea that he doesn�t know you�re being used at this moment.&nbsp; Look at me.&nbsp; I want to see it in your eyes.&nbsp; Ahh.&nbsp; There.�

She tasted the first spurt, before unexpectedly he pulled out.&nbsp; &#8232;�Keep your mouth open.&nbsp; Stick out your tongue.�&nbsp; Obediently she did and he shot most of his load there where she tasted it, before directing the final spurts onto her face.&nbsp; She felt&nbsp; a splatter just below her right eye and another lower, beside her mouth.&nbsp; He thrust his cock back in.&nbsp; �Lick it clean.�

�No don�t wipe your face.&nbsp; Wear it to your car.�

Incredulously, �You don�t mean in the elevator?�

He didn�t bother to reply and said as she started to pick up her clothes. �Leave your undergarments.&nbsp; No bra, panties, pantyhose in my presence again unless I give you specific permission.� 

When she had on her dress and shoes, �Come and look at yourself.�&nbsp; 

Carol followed him into his private bathroom.&nbsp; It was as unmistakable as she feared.&nbsp; A droplet dangled from her chin.

�You look quite beautiful.�

Just as she was at the door, Brad said, �Ravi sent me his test results.&nbsp; I told him he can use you three times a week.&nbsp; But only your mouth and ass.&nbsp; Not your cunt.�

�I�m so sore.�

�Maybe he won�t call you tonight.�

But they both knew he would.

�I�m going to be out of town for a couple of days.&nbsp; Have duplicates made of your condo keys.&nbsp; You can leave them with Mrs. Black.�

Against her hopes, but as she expected Brad had deliberately arranged, Mrs. Black was at her desk and gave a cheery, �Have a nice afternoon, Mrs. Edwards,� as Carol passed.

No one else was waiting for the elevator, and no one was on it when it came.&nbsp; Carol moved to the center of the car and stood there straight, her head held high.&nbsp; She was what she was.&nbsp; She would not try to hide. 

On the 27th floor, the car stopped and three chattering women instantly fell silent when they saw her.&nbsp; As did everyone else who entered the elevator on the long way down.

Carol drove from the dark parking levels out in the sunlight, feeling come drying on her skin.&nbsp; She didn�t wipe her face until she was back in her own office parking lot.

She lingered late at work, not wanting to go home, which no longer offered refuge.&nbsp; 

It was strange not to be wearing underwear in her office.&nbsp; She felt her breasts move more freely, and hoped no one else did, and at times a breath of air caressed her bare pussy.&nbsp;&nbsp; The taste of sperm lingered in her mouth.&nbsp; That she had just come from one cock and was moving toward another kept her wet.&nbsp;&nbsp; She hoped she was not leaving a spot on her dress.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sex was not just the occasional evening or the weekends with Ross any more.&nbsp;&nbsp; Sex was noon in Brad�s office.&nbsp; Probably this evening with Ravi in the condo.&nbsp; Sex was becoming her life.&nbsp; 

The telephone would ring, or even worse there would be a knock on her door.&nbsp; She could simply tell Ravi to get stuffed; but she knew she wouldn�t.&nbsp;&nbsp; She�d already exposed herself to him.&nbsp; Let him squeeze her breasts.&nbsp; Know that she was going to be gangbanged.&nbsp; He would only do to her what countless men had done in Julian; yet because she knew him personally made it different.&nbsp; More humiliating.&nbsp; That he was living and sleeping in the same building, just a floor away, that he could claim her at any time.&nbsp; Three times a week, Brad had said.&nbsp; How had he decided on that?&nbsp; And only her mouth and ass.&nbsp; She was to be used to give pleasure without receiving it.&nbsp; A convenient hole.&nbsp; Holes.&nbsp; She felt herself becoming wetter.

Finally she drove home and was grateful that at least she did not bump into him in the elevator.

Quickly she made herself a strong gin and tonic, which she carried through the sliding glass doors onto the balcony; but after taking two gulps, she put down the heavy crystal double old-fashioned glass, and went and took a shower.&nbsp; Why am I cleaning myself up for that little creep?, she asked herself; but knew that she wanted to be desired.&nbsp; She liked the power of her beauty.&nbsp;&nbsp; Although she had complained to Ross about the way Ravi snuck glances at her around the swimming pool, secretly she had reveled in the lust she aroused and could deny.&nbsp; Now she couldn�t.&nbsp; She could no longer say, �No.�&nbsp; She wondered what kind of cock he had and almost came as she ran the bar of soap between her legs.

Drying off she had to decide what to wear.&nbsp; Something easy to take off, and she recalled thinking in Brad�s office that that would become a priority.&nbsp; She settled for a loose sundress.&nbsp; Not bothering with underwear.&nbsp; I may save money there.&nbsp; Implication made touching up her lipstick an erotic act.&nbsp; She walked barefoot back to the balcony and her unfinished drink.

Being there made her think of Ross.&nbsp; She frowned.&nbsp; He wasn�t much in her thoughts these days.&nbsp; Her cell phone rang.
 
�Hello, Ravi.�

�Yes.&nbsp; It is, isn�t it?&nbsp; Ravi.&nbsp; I mean me.�&nbsp; His voice was pitched high and the words nervously fast.

�I�ll come down.�&nbsp; She didn�t want to have sex with him in her place, and then she remembered Brad telling her to give him keys.

�Yes.&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; That is good.&nbsp; Very go--�

She closed her cell phone mid-word.&nbsp; She had to fuck him.&nbsp; She didn�t&nbsp; have to chat.

Slipping on a pair of loafers--they weren�t sexy but they wouldn�t be on long; she would make this fast--she automatically checked her appearance in the mirror opposite the front door.&nbsp; Vanity.&nbsp; Vanity.&nbsp; Thy name is Carol.

Ravi lived on the fourth floor.&nbsp; She took the stairs down.&nbsp; 

She had never been to his unit before. 

On the door was a heavy brass knocker shaped in the head of the monkey god, Hanuman.&nbsp;&nbsp; Ravi opened at the first tap.

�Oh,&nbsp; yes.&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; Come in.&nbsp; Come in.�

His unit was laid out exactly like hers and Ross�s but faced north.&nbsp;&nbsp; The furnishings were a mix of Indian and IKEA.&nbsp;&nbsp; A camera on a tripod stood pointing toward the sofa.

Ravi was wearing baggy khaki shorts, Birkenstock sandals, and a short sleeved white dress shirt.&nbsp; Indicating the camera, Ravi said apologetically, �Brad wants a picture.&nbsp; That is all right, is it?&nbsp; Then, �Please sit.&nbsp; A drink?&nbsp; Wine?&nbsp; A cocktail?�

Who knows what the old Carol would have done? she thought.&nbsp; The old Carol wouldn�t be here.&nbsp; But the new Carol, turned and faced him as he danced toward the kitchen and said,&nbsp; �We both know why I�m here.�&nbsp; He stopped dead as she pulled the hem of her dress up over her head, and he collapsed onto the sofa as she tossed it aside and kicked off her loafers. 

�Oh.&nbsp; What have they done to you?� he cried.

In a wide mirror behind him she caught sight of herself.&nbsp; She had forgotten about her bruises.&nbsp; They were old news.

�They fucked me senseless.&nbsp; That is what they did.�

She twirled slowly, displaying all the lascivious marks , enjoying his shock. 

�Why do you let them do this?&nbsp; Who is this Brad?&nbsp; What hold does he have on you?&nbsp; Is he blackmailing you?&nbsp; I will help.�

She laughed.&nbsp; �You will help blackmail me?�

�No.&nbsp; No.&nbsp; That is not.&nbsp; I will help you.�

�I do not need help.&nbsp; Or maybe I do.&nbsp; But not that way.&nbsp; I�m not being blackmailed.&nbsp; No one has done anything to me that I did not want.&nbsp; And you are no better.&nbsp; You want to do the same.�

In two steps she was in front of him and dropped to her knees for the second time that day.&nbsp; She half-smiled as in her mind she heard, �On my knees again�&nbsp; to the melody of Willie Nelson�s �On the Road Again.�

�You are so beautiful.�&nbsp; Ravi�s voice was plaintive.&nbsp; �Like some goddess or movie star.&nbsp; I always dreamed.&nbsp; But you were so far above me.&nbsp; Unobtainable.&nbsp; I never thought it would happen.&nbsp; I had no idea that you were��

Carol�s&nbsp; tanned fingers were the exact shade of Ravi�s skin as they unbuckled his belt and pulled off his shorts.&nbsp; Beneath were a pair of clean white boxers.&nbsp; He changed for me.&nbsp; How sweet.&nbsp; And beneath them a bigger and blacker cock than she had expected on his frail frame.

Leaning forward she rubbed her nipples against it, then formed a tunnel between her breasts.

�Ohhhhh.�

She slid her breasts up and down a few times.&nbsp; Her first black man,&nbsp; black men, had been during the gangbang.&nbsp; Ravi wasn�t black, but his cock was.&nbsp; She liked the contrast of the hard dark column between her pale breasts.&nbsp; She saw the reflection in the mirror.&nbsp; On my knees in front of a man.&nbsp; About to suck another cock.&nbsp; Until last Friday she had never been with two men in one day.&nbsp; And not for love.&nbsp; Like some slave or whore.&nbsp; Her second client of the day.&nbsp; She could service more, and expected that she soon would. She shifted so that her pussy pressed down on the heel of her right foot and moaned.&nbsp; 

The moment her head lowered and her lips wrapped around his cock, Ravi screamed and came.&nbsp; Gushers.&nbsp; An unending stream and scream&nbsp; that surely would be heard by the neighbors.&nbsp; What did she care?&nbsp; They didn�t know she was the one in there with him.&nbsp; Then, defiantly, what if they did?&nbsp; 

Carol Edwards swallowed and swallowed and finally, sperm and scream trickled to a stop.

Ravi�s head was thrown back as Carol stood and retrieved her dress.

He looked up in amazement, and embarrassment.&nbsp; �I have never...I have thought of you for so long.&nbsp; For years.&nbsp; Imagined making love to you.&nbsp; And all this weekend I thought of you having sex with all those men.&nbsp; I did not really believe that Brad person, but I arranged to be tested first thing Monday morning.&nbsp; I do not understand��&nbsp; Then something shifted.&nbsp; Carol felt a momentary chill as his eyes narrowed, hardened,&nbsp; �Next time I will last longer.�&nbsp;&nbsp;

Involuntarily, Ross Edwards spoke aloud:&nbsp; �Not Ravi, too?�

The small things:

The grin from the man yesterday as he left Brad&#8217;s office.&nbsp; Had his cock been in her?&nbsp; Had he seen her face contorted with lust?&nbsp; Had she swallowed his come?&nbsp; 

The edginess this morning as she ate breakfast and dressed for work knowing that at any instant the phone might ring and it would be Ravi.

The sense of uneasiness, almost fear at the control she was relinquishing, as with a sound like a dentist drill a man in a hardware store copied the keys to the main entrance of the condo building and to her front door. 

Squirming out of her panties and bra in the underground parking before taking the elevator up to give the keys to Mrs. Black.&nbsp; The brief touch of the leather car seat against her naked ass.&nbsp; She didn&#8217;t really expect that Brad would be there.&nbsp; He had said he wouldn&#8217;t be.&nbsp; But she liked the sexuality of the act.&nbsp; She might not even bother to put her underwear back on and again spend the afternoon in her office with her clit dangling in the breeze.

Wondering every time the rising elevator stopped at another floor if someone would get on who had seen her yesterday.

And the immaculately groomed Mrs. Black&#8217;s enigmatic smile as Carol handed her the envelope.&nbsp; �Yes.&nbsp; Brad told me you&#8217;d be dropping these off.�&nbsp; Her eyes dropped to Carol&#8217;s loose breasts beneath a high necked dark blue dress, and then down to her bare legs.&nbsp; San Diego isn&#8217;t Boston.&nbsp; Legs are tanned year round and many women don&#8217;t wear nylons to work.&nbsp; It wasn&#8217;t that unusual.&nbsp; Before moving back up to her face.&nbsp; �Was there anything else?�

�N..No.�&nbsp; Carol stammered.&nbsp; Then, �Yes.&nbsp; When will he be back.�

The older woman laughed.&nbsp; �He didn&#8217;t go.&nbsp; The trip was canceled.�

�Then he&#8217;s--�&nbsp; But she didn&#8217;t finish and turned toward the elevator.
He is very, very good at this.&nbsp; I asked him to make me feel something, and he certainly has.

�

Ravi called that night and brutally took her ass.&nbsp; As she knew he would.&nbsp; Lost illusions.&nbsp; Tarnished angels.&nbsp; Fallen idols get trampled.


10

She woke and opened her eyes, but did not move.&nbsp; The red digital display on the bedside clock read 2:18.&nbsp;&nbsp; The bedroom was 
pitch-dark.&nbsp; Curtains drawn.&nbsp; Someone was there.&nbsp; Perhaps she was dreaming.&nbsp; No.&nbsp; She held her breath and froze at the sounds of movement.

�Brad?�

�No.�&nbsp; And it wasn&#8217;t.&nbsp; She had never heard that voice before.&nbsp; �Don&#8217;t turn on the light and don&#8217;t scream, and you&#8217;ll be all right.�

�But he sent you?�

The only response was to feel the sheet and light blanket covering her being pulled down.

She slept in a white satin nightshirt.&nbsp; Mid-thigh.&nbsp; Buttons up the front.&nbsp; She was lying on her left side.

Weight on the foot of the bed.&nbsp; She whimpered.

A hand fumbled, found her ankle, moved up.&nbsp; She panted in fear.&nbsp; The other hand found her hip.&nbsp;&nbsp; Turned and pulled her onto her knees, ass up, face down.&nbsp; The night shirt fell forward to her shoulders.&nbsp; 

She expected the cock to enter her ass and gasped as it slid easily&nbsp; into her now always wet cunt.&nbsp; �Ohhh.�&nbsp; It felt so good.&nbsp; 

Hands gripped her hips.&nbsp; The cock filled her.&nbsp; Withdrew.&nbsp; Plunged and filled her again.&nbsp; Began a strong, steady rhythm.&nbsp; Hit the right spots.&nbsp; Her fingers clawed the sheet.&nbsp; She bit the pillow and came.

But for the hands holding her ass high, she would have collapsed.

The cock, the beautiful cock--she thought of it that way though she would never see it--the beautiful cock kept thrusting.&nbsp; Minutes passed.&nbsp; Time lost meaning.&nbsp; There was only cock.&nbsp; She was being raped in her own bed.&nbsp; In her and Ross&#8217;s bed.&nbsp; Not raped exactly.&nbsp; She came again.&nbsp; Shuddering.&nbsp; Slobbering onto the pillow.

The cock was becoming harder, bigger, swelling with blood and come.&nbsp; Buried deep, the cock stopped, spasmed, emptied.&nbsp; The man sighed.&nbsp; 

Hands released her hips.&nbsp; She fell onto her stomach.&nbsp; Felt a wet cock being wiped on her ass.&nbsp; Heard sheets rustle as it was further wiped on them.&nbsp; Felt weight lifting from the mattress.&nbsp; Heard clothes being pulled on.&nbsp; Footsteps moving away, down the corridor toward the living room.&nbsp; A distant door clicked.

Carol Edwards lay in her bed crying.&nbsp; She wasn&#8217;t even sure why.

�

The next morning she called Brad as soon as she thought he would be at his office.&nbsp; 

�I&#8217;m sorry, Mrs. Edwards, but Mr. Tomalin is in a meeting.�

�Tell him to call me as soon as possible.&nbsp; It&#8217;s important.�

�I&#8217;m sure it is.�&nbsp; What was that in her voice:&nbsp; condescension?&nbsp; amusement?&nbsp; 

�

At 8:30 that evening--a time that would soon become significant--on her second martini, half watching the 1940 Alfred Hitchcock classic, REBECCA, on television, she heard a key, and the front door opened.

The moment Brad entered, she confronted him with, �You didn&#8217;t return my call.�

�You knew I wouldn&#8217;t.&nbsp; That&#8217;s not the way this works.�

�It&#8217;s going too far too fast,� she cried half hysterical.

�No.&nbsp; It isn&#8217;t &#8216;going.&#8217;&nbsp; It&#8217;s already &#8216;gone.&#8217;&nbsp; Or have you forgotten even before the bruises have faded?&nbsp; If so, I can show you some photos.�

�Is that it?&nbsp; Are you blackmailing me?�

He laughed.&nbsp; �I don&#8217;t need to blackmail you.&nbsp; I have no trouble finding women to fuck.&nbsp; You are certainly an attractive piece; but what&#8217;s really interesting here is that for whatever perverse reasons you chose to destroy your old self.&nbsp; This is all being done of your own free will, assuming free will exists.&nbsp; All that&#8217;s left is for the two of us to discover how far you&#8217;ll go; if you have any limits at all.�

�Who was that last night?�

�It doesn&#8217;t matter.�

And when he saw in her face that she realized he was right, he started walking toward the back of the condo and called over his shoulder, �Let&#8217;s go to bed.&nbsp; And sleep naked from now on.�

The attachments had become an addiction.&nbsp; Ross Edwards didn&#8217;t want to open them, but he couldn&#8217;t help himself.&nbsp; He was appalled, fascinated, disgusted, aroused.&nbsp; Images, audio files, finally even videos.&nbsp; He saw his wife being used.&nbsp; By Brad.&nbsp; By Ravi.&nbsp; Increasingly by other neighbors.&nbsp; By strangers.&nbsp; In offices.&nbsp; Condos.&nbsp; Cars.&nbsp; In his own living room.&nbsp; On the couch.&nbsp; On the floor.&nbsp; Even in his own bed. But not used in every possible way.&nbsp; Almost never was there a cock--or anything else--in Carol&#8217;s cunt.

And then messages began being left on his answering machine.&nbsp; Not always messages.&nbsp; Sometimes a male voice, sometimes Carol&#8217;s voice, describing in vivid detail what was being done to her at that very moment.&nbsp; Sometimes just sounds.&nbsp; Flesh against flesh.&nbsp; Groans.&nbsp; Gasps.&nbsp; Grunts.&nbsp; Male.&nbsp; Female.&nbsp;&nbsp; A hand slap?&nbsp; A gurgle?&nbsp; Unidentifiable sounds.

Ross struggled against it, but he was aware ever minute, night and day, that she might be being used, and he was always aroused.&nbsp; They both were.&nbsp; He locked the files in an encrypted disc image on his hard drive, and he masturbated four or five times a day, even in his own office, while looking at or listening to them.&nbsp; 

He had spoken directly to her only once since the telephone call to Brad&#8217;s car on their way to Julian.&nbsp; She had apologized.&nbsp; Apologized!&nbsp; As if that were even possible.&nbsp; And she had said that she couldn&#8217;t stop.&nbsp; She did not want to stop.&nbsp; She did not understand what possessed her.&nbsp; Perhaps something about Brad--a sight, a sound, a smell, behavior, attitude, a pheromone--had flipped a switch in her brain.&nbsp; It did not matter.&nbsp; She asked if he wanted a divorce.

To himself he thought:&nbsp; You rotten fucking bitch.&nbsp; But, wanting to leave his options open as he planned revenge, to her he said only that he would think about it

�

Brad Tomalin did not think of himself as a sadist.&nbsp; He was interested in power, not pain, although the ability to inflict pain was sometimes proof of power, and the willingness to accept it proof of someone else&#8217;s power.&nbsp; 

Brad had a simple definition of power:&nbsp; the ability to make a man say yes when he wanted to say no.&nbsp; Or a woman.&nbsp; And by &#8216;say&#8217; he meant actions as well as words.&nbsp; A man on death row does not want to be executed.&nbsp; The state has the power to make him say yes to his death.

To Brad Tomalin Ross Edwards was a lab rat.&nbsp; 

Carol Edwards was beautiful and she brought him pleasure; but as he had told her, and she would in time see first hand, so did many other women.&nbsp; He was decent looking, if not handsome, physically strong, ruthless, and wealthy.&nbsp; Women liked him.&nbsp; Not all.&nbsp; But more than enough.

Carol and Ross Edwards were a scientific experiment.&nbsp; The unique pleasure was clinically to devise new ways to degrade them, and then observe the results.&nbsp; To increasingly invade their lives and minds and leave them exposed without refuge.&nbsp; Carol already had little left.&nbsp; Not her own home or even her own bed, in which she now obediantly slept naked; not even her sleep.&nbsp; There were only a few times and places when she was not subject to being used instantly.&nbsp; When she was out shopping, or driving, or other random occasions.&nbsp;&nbsp; And in her own office.&nbsp; He would change that.

Brad harbored no ill feelings toward Ross.&nbsp; He did not know him.&nbsp; Although he had come to despise him a little.&nbsp; If someone else had done to him what he was doing to Ross, he would not have sat in Singapore.&nbsp; He would have had the man killed.&nbsp; It was as simple as that.&nbsp;&nbsp; 

Carol he could observe first hand, but he had no way of knowing precisely his effect on Ross.&nbsp; He kept sending the emails, the photos, the audio files, the videos, the telephone messages; dropping them like proverbial stones in a smooth pond, ripples circling out; but he did not see those ripples touch the far shore.&nbsp; If he had, he would have found the results very interesting.&nbsp;

Tomorrow at 3:00 a.m. your time--noon ours--you are invited to listen&nbsp; your wife having an orgasm. 

As you know I don&#8217;t permit her to come often.&nbsp;&nbsp; I&#8217;ve told her that tomorrow is her lucky day.&nbsp; She is excited.&nbsp; But then she is always excited lately.

She doesn&#8217;t know it will be with this.


Ross clicked on the image.&nbsp; &#8216;This&#8217; proved to be a big black dildo, at least two inches thick and a foot long, with a suction base, sticking up from the middle of Brad&#8217;s desk.

�

Ross Edwards got out of the taxi on Upper Bukit Timah Road four miles from his downtown office and glanced around guiltily as though he were meeting a drug dealer.&nbsp; Ross didn&#8217;t use drugs, although he was beginning to think he should.&nbsp;&nbsp; Google had turned up shops closer to his office, but he didn&#8217;t want to chance being seen.

Entering one of Singapore&#8217;s ubiquitous shopping plazas, he took an escalator to the mezzanine and in a discreet shop found exactly what he was looking for, all the time wondering if he had been driven truly insane.

�

Once in his apartment, he tested his purchase.&nbsp; It hurt.&nbsp; It was supposed to hurt.&nbsp; He wanted it to hurt. Yet it wasn&#8217;t his fault.&nbsp; But it was his fault.&nbsp; He no longer knew.

He set the alarm for 2:30, but slept fitfully and was awake before the alarm went off.&nbsp; When the telephone rang a few minutes after 3, he was naked, lubed, and in position.

He did not pick up the phone, but let the answering machine play over the speaker.

�Hello, Ross, old man.&nbsp; Getting your beauty rest?&nbsp; Or are you listening?

�In any event, your beautiful wife has just breathlessly arrived.&nbsp; Being breathless does wonderful things to her tits beneath that blouse.&nbsp; I&#8217;ll send you a picture, but for the record, she arrived in a lovely fawn colored business suit, cream colored blouse, and matching high heels.&nbsp; About 3�, I&#8217;d say.&nbsp; They&#8217;re new.&nbsp; A little higher than she wore when you were here. I think you know she&#8217;s naked underneath, so it won&#8217;t take her long to get undressed.

�Say, hello to Ross, Carol.�

�Hello, Ross.�

�Is that resignation we hear in your voice, Carol?&nbsp; Ah, well, every marriage has its ups and downs.

�She&#8217;s naked now, Ross.

�Climb up there.&nbsp; I&#8217;ll give you a hand.&nbsp; A big step.&nbsp; Sensational view.&nbsp; That&#8217;s it.&nbsp; Right there.&nbsp; I trust you&#8217;ve seen the photo by now, Ross.&nbsp; Carol is squatting on my desk with her very red, very wet cunt positioned just above her lover.�

�I thought it was going to be you,� she protested.

�Well it&#8217;s not.&nbsp; When did I last let you come?&nbsp; When did you last have anything in there at all?&nbsp; Ungrateful wench.

�O.K. Ross here she goes.�&nbsp; Then, speaking to Carol and having no idea anyone else would obey his command,&nbsp; �Impale yourself.�

Simultaneous moans an ocean apart as naked Carol Edwards lowered her shaved cunt onto a big black dildo jutting up from a desktop in San Diego and Ross Edwards lowered his hairy ass onto a big black dildo jutting up from the desktop in his study in Singapore.

�Now fuck yourself.�&nbsp; 

And they both did.

Carol Edwards throwing her head back, grabbing, twisting her breasts with her hands.&nbsp; 

Ross Edwards furiously jerking his cock.

Both riding up and down.&nbsp; Up and down.&nbsp; Truly fucked.

Ravi talked.&nbsp; Of course Ravi talked.&nbsp; He was emptying his balls into the most beautiful woman around, and he wanted people to know.&nbsp; He also wanted to help bring her down.

Ravi asked Brad if he could give out his phone number to others in the building, and soon the formerly pleasant but reserved Mrs. Edwards, Vice President of the 425 San Dimas Street Condominium Association, was on considerably more intimate terms with four of her neighbors.&nbsp; Ravi made five.&nbsp; Counting herself, they only needed two more to make a quorum.&nbsp; 

�

Brad Tomalin unlocked the entrance door and went into the now familiar lobby.&nbsp;&nbsp; Glass doors ahead opened to the patio and swimming pool.&nbsp; To his right a wall of mailboxes and green potted plants.&nbsp; To his left the elevator and a door to the central stairwell.

He entered the elevator, but got off at the second floor rather than continuing to the fifth.&nbsp; 

The door to 2S was directly in front of him when the elevator stopped.&nbsp; He went around the corner and knocked on 2E.&nbsp; A woman opened the door.&nbsp; She was about Carol&#8217;s height of 5&#8217;9�, but ten years older and fifteen to twenty pounds heavier.&nbsp; Not fat.&nbsp; Solid.&nbsp; Her greying hair was cut short, not much longer than his.&nbsp; She was wearing a loose shift that reached to thick ankles, flat sandals.&nbsp; No makeup.&nbsp; She reminded him of Judi Dench as &#8216;M&#8217; in the James Bond movies.

�You&#8217;re obviously Brad.&nbsp; I&#8217;ve seen you in the building.&nbsp; I&#8217;m Faye.&nbsp; Come on in.�

All the units must be the same, Brad thought.&nbsp; Living, dining and kitchen one large wallless space flowing from the glass doors opening onto the balcony back to a corridor leading past the utility room to bedrooms and bathrooms in the rear.

Faye&#8217;s space was cluttered.&nbsp; Almost every inch of the walls was covered by paintings and photographs, some original, some reproductions.&nbsp; A mobile hung from the ceiling.&nbsp; Knick knacks, bric-a-brac, and books fought for space on end tables and shelves.&nbsp; Miniature ceramic elephants.&nbsp; Music boxes.&nbsp; Artificial flowers.&nbsp; A collection of piggy banks.&nbsp; Toy soldiers.

�Sit where you like.&nbsp; I&#8217;m drinking white wine.&nbsp; Can I get you a glass.�&nbsp; Her voice and manner were direct.

&#8216;No.&nbsp; I&#8217;m fine.�&nbsp; 

Brad sat in a chair facing the balcony.&nbsp; The woman on another across a coffee table from him.

�I admire your directness.&nbsp; I am too.&nbsp; You want Carol Edwards.&nbsp; Fine.&nbsp; But I have terms.�

�I&#8217;m not going to take your cock just to get her pussy.�

He smiled and thought to himself:&nbsp; you flatter yourself, but said, �I don&#8217;t want you to.�

�Then what do you want?�

�For you to lick my ass.�

Peals of laughter rose from the woman like chimes from a church bell.&nbsp; �Really?�&nbsp; she finally gasped.

�Really.�

The pieces of her face abruptly rearranged.&nbsp; �You&#8217;re serious.�

�Yes.�

Silence.&nbsp; Then, �No.�

�All right,� and he started to rise from the chair.

�Wait.�

�Well?�&nbsp;&nbsp; Certain now how this would end.

�Your ass or your asshole?�

�Both.&nbsp; But not often.&nbsp; I know you don&#8217;t do men.&nbsp; But an asshole is an asshole.&nbsp; Male.&nbsp; Female.&nbsp; What&#8217;s the difference?&nbsp; And I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ve performed annalingus before.�

�They say you don&#8217;t permit them to use her pussy.�

�That&#8217;s right.&nbsp; I keep her perpetually horny.&nbsp; But you can.&nbsp; You can have her three times a week just like the others; but I&#8217;ll let you make her come from time to time, which they can&#8217;t.&nbsp; Say every other week or so.&nbsp; I&#8217;m sure she will be extremely grateful.&nbsp; And as you may not know, she&#8217;s never been with a woman before.&nbsp; You get that vestige of her tattered virginity.�

�You know I&#8217;m am a dominant woman.�

�That&#8217;s why I want you to lick my ass.&nbsp; Also I&#8217;m going to choreograph your first encounter.&nbsp; No permanent damage to the goods.&nbsp; No bruises above the shoulder or below mid-thigh.&nbsp; Nothing that will show when she&#8217;s wearing normal street clothes.&nbsp; At least for now.&nbsp; And I want you to take pictures.&nbsp; Of her.&nbsp; Of the two of you together.&nbsp; I send the most vivid to her husband.�

�You are a bastard.�

Brad inclined his head.

�Do you want me to do it now?�

�Upstairs.�

Eagerly.&nbsp; �Let&#8217;s go.�


Carol was not in sight when they entered her condo.

�She must be in the back.&nbsp; Go surprise her,� Brad instructed.

He went to the liquor cabinet and poured himself some of Ross&#8217;s Lagavulin.

He was sitting in a leather and wood chair facing the off-white sofa when the two women returned.&nbsp; A hand painted fabric with squares of earth colors against a flat black background hung on the wall behind the sofa, and three matching throw cushions on the sofa itself.&nbsp; Glass end tables of minimalist modern design at either end.&nbsp; A large mostly beige and mauve abstract carpet over the hardwood floor.

Carol had just showered and her hair was still damp.&nbsp;&nbsp; She was barefoot and wearing white shorts and a yellow tank top through which dark nipples were visible.&nbsp;&nbsp; Although only a few hours earlier, she had been bent over his desk with her skirt above her waist, her beauty struck him anew.&nbsp; She looked clean and fresh and innocent.&nbsp; And wary.&nbsp; Though this could hardly have been unexpected.

�Sit on the sofa, the two of you.&nbsp; But strip first, Carol.�

The thicker woman rearranged one of the throw cushions and took a seat at one end of the sofa, while with quick movements, Carol Edwards pulled the tank top up and her shorts down, before sitting at the other end. 

�Turn and face her.&nbsp; Lean back.&nbsp; Your right foot on the sofa back.&nbsp; Show her what&#8217;s she getting.�

Faye&#8217;s eyes feasted on splayed flesh. 

�Spread it open for her.�&nbsp; Carol&#8217;s hands moved down.&nbsp; Her eyes on the other woman, whose eyes were fixed on flowering slit,&nbsp; unaware that her tongue was flicking like a snake.

�Mirror her, Faye.�

Heavy body turned, left leg raised.&nbsp; The sole of a wider foot pressed against Carol&#8217;s elegance.&nbsp; 

Without being told, the older woman pulled up the hem of her shift, exposing muscular thighs and a thick bush of grey wiry hair.

Brad laughed.&nbsp; �No panties.&nbsp; You were ready.�

�Yes.�&nbsp; Voice lust thickened.

�And you would have agree to anything?�

�Almost.�

He kept them sitting there a few moments, withholding a treat from a pet.&nbsp;&nbsp; Both pairs of eyes were fixed upon the other&#8217;s slit.&nbsp; One pair hungrily; one pair curiously.

�All right:&nbsp; she&#8217;s yours�

With alacrity, Faye pulled her shift over her head, exposing small flat breasts with small hard nipples.&nbsp;&nbsp; Did the shape of her body form her sexual predilections, or did her lesbianism form her body?, Brad wondered.&nbsp; 

Faye leaned forward and covered Carol.&nbsp; They both gasped at the contact of hot flesh.&nbsp; Her face hesitated a few inches above Carol&#8217;s, eyes searching, seeking, fleetingly pleading, before lowering, lips meeting in a sweet kiss.&nbsp; 

Faye broke the kiss and breathed,&nbsp; �Like all the men in this building, I&#8217;ve wanted and fantasized about you for so long.&nbsp; I won&#8217;t always be this gentle.�

�Good.�&nbsp; 

�Good?�

Carol nodded

Hands wrapped in Carol&#8217;s hair and lips met again.&nbsp; Mouths opened, tongues touched.&nbsp; 

Strong hands moved.&nbsp; Carol&#8217;s head fell back.&nbsp; Her lips still parted.&nbsp; Fingers cupped full breasts, squeezed, teased nipples.&nbsp; �So beautiful.�&nbsp; 

Small pink diamond hard nipples above larger dark ones.&nbsp;&nbsp; Breasts melded.&nbsp; Flattened.&nbsp; Carol moaned.

Tongue tip traced a line down to Carol&#8217;s navel, probed, moved lower. 

Faye sat back on her heels, separating their bodies, kneeling on the sofa between Carol&#8217;s widely splayed legs.&nbsp; Carol&#8217;s right foot was&nbsp; still on the sofa back; left on the floor.

�You haven&#8217;t had a cock in there today, have you?�

�No.�

�When last?�

�I&#8217;m not sure.&nbsp; Two weeks ago, maybe.�

�You&#8217;re to tell me if you have.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t want to stick my tongue up there someday and taste come.�

She flicked Carol&#8217;s clit with her forefinger, and the younger woman winced.

Forefinger turned and caressed, parted folds, entered, moved deeper, withdrew, was joined by a second finger as Faye bent forward and laid her tongue against Carol&#8217;s clit.

Tongue and fingers began their rhythm.&nbsp; Carol&#8217;s arms were above her head on the sofa arm.&nbsp; Her head was back.&nbsp; Throat stretched taut.&nbsp; Eyes closed.&nbsp; She had last come fucking herself with the dildo on Brad&#8217;s desk several days ago.&nbsp;&nbsp; This felt so good.&nbsp; Faye&#8217;s lips had been so soft against hers.&nbsp; So different from a man&#8217;s.&nbsp; And the way she licked and stroked.&nbsp; 

As the pleasure mounted and her breathing quickened and small sounds began to come from her throat, she turned her face toward Brad and opened her eyes, watching him watching her.&nbsp; Pleased that he was watching her.

Her hips began to move, thrusting up against mouth and fingers, until with a great shudder, she came.

Faye&#8217;s face was covered with Carol&#8217;s juices.&nbsp; She licked her lips, leaned back, and spread her knees.

Carol knew what was expected of her.&nbsp; 

Rearranging her legs, she moved her body above the older woman&#8217;s, kissed Faye&#8217;s mouth, licked her wet cheeks,&nbsp; stroked her nipples.

�Squeeze.� 

Thumbs and forefingers pressed.

�Ahh.&nbsp;&nbsp; That&#8217;s good.&nbsp; Harder.�&nbsp; Then again, �Harder.�&nbsp; Pink flesh was compressed white, bloodless, before, �Enough.�

Hands pushed her head down.&nbsp; 

Carol had never tasted another woman, but she had tasted herself on fingers and cocks.&nbsp; This was not much different.&nbsp; Less than the difference in taste among cocks and come.

After Carol released her nipples, Faye remained silent.&nbsp; But as Carol licked, those muscular thighs closed and clamped her head.&nbsp; Broad feet and thick ankles locked behind her neck.&nbsp; Wiry hair caught in her teeth.&nbsp; Then suddenly released.&nbsp; Carol was not even sure the woman had come, until a foot pushed her away.

�No more.�

�My turn now, ladies.�&nbsp; He didn&#8217;t want to give them time to recover.

Brad was naked.&nbsp; When, both women wondered, had that happened?

�Knell on the floor, facing one another, a foot or so apart.�

�That&#8217;s good.�&nbsp; 

He stood between them.&nbsp; His cock pointing toward Carol.&nbsp; She opened her mouth and sucked him in.&nbsp; A few seconds passed before he felt warm breath against his ass.&nbsp; Lips kissed his right cheek, moved slowly toward the center.&nbsp; Another pause, while Carol&#8217;s head continued bobbing.&nbsp; Hands spread his ass.&nbsp; A nose bumped.&nbsp; A tentative tongue.&nbsp; He reached back with his right hand and forced the face forward.&nbsp; �Deeper.�&nbsp; And two tongues and mouths obeyed.

For several minutes he stood savoring the sensations and the women&#8217;s servitude, before extracting his cock from Carol Edwards&#8217; mouth and turning around.&nbsp; 

Immediately he felt Carol&#8217;s tongue licking his anus.&nbsp; 

His cock was in Faye&#8217;s face, the glistening tip an inch from her nose.&nbsp; Her brown eyes looked up at him.&nbsp; He looked down inscrutably.&nbsp; They both listened to Carol slurping.&nbsp; Finally Faye tilted her head forward, closed the gap, and took him in her mouth.

Brad let her suck on him for a minute.&nbsp; That was enough.&nbsp; He wondered what she would do if he came?&nbsp; But he didn&#8217;t really want her.&nbsp; He would not have cared if she hadn&#8217;t taken his cock.&nbsp; He had simply been curious.&nbsp; He turned again and gave Carol his come.

�

Tongues, lips, breasts, fingers, legs, cunts, ass, a cock; but the evening, he thought as he drove home, was really about the eyes.
&nbsp;&nbsp; 

13

The alarm went off at 5:00 a.m., an hour earlier than it used to.

Carol Edwards rolled naked from her bed and stumbled into the bathroom, where she came awake beneath a brief shower, careful to keep her hair dry.

She gargled with Listerine and brushed her teeth, applied lipstick, ran a comb through her hair, before returning to the bedroom and donning flat sandals and a sleeveless dress with seven big wood buttons up the front.&nbsp; She never ran into anyone in the hallways at this hour--and besides everyone in the building must know by now--so to save time she only secured the second and fifth buttons, before leaving her unit and taking the stairs down to the third floor.&nbsp; Today was David in 3N, Vern in 3E, and Faye. 

From a key ring that rivaled the maintenance man&#8217;s, she selected 3N and unlocked David&#8217;s door.&nbsp; Leaving keys, dress and sandals in the living room, she walked naked to the back of the unit.

David had a prescribed ritual. 

He was lying on his back, pretending to be asleep; but as she pulled down the covers the tent in his pajama bottoms proved that he was not. He kept his eyes closed and made no sound as she freed his cock and took it in her mouth.&nbsp; She didn&#8217;t suck to get him harder, but to cover him with lubricating saliva to make it easier for herself.&nbsp; 

When she thought he was wet enough, she straddled him, facing his feet.&nbsp;&nbsp; Licking her fingers, she reached back and opened her anus before slowly lowering onto his cock.&nbsp; 

With such constant repetition, anal sex had become easier for her.&nbsp; She liked the fullness of a cock in her, and in the absence of one in her orphaned pussy, sodomy would have to do.&nbsp; She had never quite had an anal orgasm, but she thought that someday she might.

David continued to feign sleep as she raised and lowered her hips.&nbsp; 

In the dark room she could just distinguish his long pale feet.&nbsp; 

She did not look back, but sensed that his eyes were open, watching his shaft being alternating buried and revealed.&nbsp; 

He came soundlessly.

She wasn&#8217;t always sure, but this morning his cock definitely pulsed and she was instantly wetter.

Lifting.&nbsp; Plopping sound as he came free.&nbsp; Carol turned.&nbsp; Lowered her head and sucked him clean, before tucking his cock back in his pajamas, and leaving the old man, still pretending to sleep.


�

Vern, a plain looking, middle aged high school physics teacher, was waiting for her, sitting in his living room wearing a bathrobe and sipping a cup of coffee.

Carol felt sorry for shy Vern, whom she had never known to have a girl friend.&nbsp;&nbsp; She was in fact performing a public service, a chartable act.

He smiled at her almost apologetically and said, �Hi.�

�Hi, Vern.�

�Want some coffee?�

�I&#8217;d love some, but,� she shrugged,&nbsp; �no time.�

�Someone else next?�&nbsp; Disappointed at the lost illusion.

�You know I don&#8217;t kiss and tell.�

�You don&#8217;t kiss at all.�

In reply she let her dress fall open, and he drew in his breath.

�What today?�&nbsp; Carol asked.

A cushion dropped to the hardwood floor, and she dropped to her knees.

Vern always came quickly and copiously.&nbsp; His come was unusually thick, as though accumulated and concentrated for years.&nbsp; Carol had trouble swallowing it all, but she did, wiped her lips with the back of her hand.&nbsp; And gave him a quick kiss on the top of his bald head, before leaving him to finish his coffee.

�

Faye was more demanding and complicated, but this morning she was still in bed as Carol Edwards made her way to the back of yet another condo unit.

A lamp flicked on in the master bedroom ahead of her.&nbsp; Faye slept in sheer black negligees which didn&#8217;t seem in character.

She was sitting up in bed.&nbsp; The hard angles of her body incongruous beneath black film.

�Have they used both your holes?�

�Yes.�

�Come over here.&nbsp; Let me smell your breath�.Turn around.�&nbsp; Hard hands spread her ass.&nbsp; �You are a disgusting slut. Lick my cunt and get out.�

�

Fifteen minutes later Carol Edwards was back in her own unit, taking her second shower of the day.&nbsp; In all likelihood it would not be her last.

Brad Tomalin left the office late that evening.&nbsp; On the elevator on the way down to his car he glanced at his watch:&nbsp; 8:30.

As he exited the parking garage and regained a cell phone signal, he said, �Call, Carol.�

�Hello.�

�I&#8217;ll be there in about ten minutes.&nbsp; Get on the floor naked with your ass toward the door, knees apart, head down, so that the first thing I see when I come through the door is your cunt and asshole.&nbsp; And leave the door unlocked.&nbsp; I want you aware that anyone could come in.�

�

She heard the door open.&nbsp; Then silence.&nbsp; Then, �Very nice.�

Footsteps sharp on the hardwood floor, softened as they reached the carpet.&nbsp; Brown tasseled loafers, light tan suit trousers seen from the corner of her eyes circled her, stepped back from view.&nbsp; A shoed foot touched the inside of her right thigh.&nbsp; �Wider.&nbsp;&nbsp; Good.&nbsp; That&#8217;s better.�&nbsp; Footsteps moved away to the side.&nbsp; �Stretch your arms out as far as you can.&nbsp; Hands palm down on the carpet.&nbsp; Very good.�&nbsp; Footsteps behind her again.&nbsp; �Reach back and spread your ass.&nbsp; Hmm.&nbsp; Both are good, I&#8217;m not sure which I prefer.�

Footsteps on hardwood.&nbsp; A cabinet opened.&nbsp; Bottle clicked against glass.&nbsp; Liquid poured.&nbsp; Footsteps returned.&nbsp; A body compressed cushions.&nbsp; Liquid sipped.&nbsp; Swallowed.&nbsp; Glass against glass end table.&nbsp; She could not see him, but she could see him in her mind.&nbsp; She could see herself in her mind, kneeling submissively, spread open, waiting.&nbsp; A powerfully erotic tableau.

For several minutes motionless silence, broken only by a glass being lifted and set down.

Finally, �I didn&#8217;t plan this.&nbsp; Just an impulse when I called.&nbsp; But I like it.&nbsp; Every evening you are here alone I want you in that exact position exactly at 8:30.&nbsp; With your door unlocked.&nbsp; Leave your door unlocked all the time from now on.&nbsp; If no one comes through the door by 9:00 p.m. you can get up.&nbsp; I&#8217;ll enjoy knowing you are kneeling here waiting.&nbsp; It will remind you of your subservience.�

�As if that is necessary,� she mumbled into the carpet.

He laughed, finished his drink, fucked her in the ass, and left without another word.

Joints stiff from having been on her knees for so long, Carol got to her feet awkwardly.&nbsp; Feeling come start to trickle from her ass, she put her hand between her legs to keep it from dropping onto the carpet, and hobbled back to the guest bathroom, which was closest.

Removing her hand in front of the sink, she watched her reflection as if watching a stranger as the hand which she had intended to rinse, rose to the stranger&#8217;s mouth which licked the fingers clean.

�

The unlocked door.&nbsp; Lying in bed, trying to fall asleep, her mind was fixated on the unlocked door at the other end of the condo.&nbsp; How far away was it?&nbsp; Thirty steps?&nbsp; More?&nbsp; Less? 

She had to know and got out of bed and paced the distance.&nbsp; Eight steps from bed to bedroom door.&nbsp; Fifteen steps along the corridor to the corner of the living room.&nbsp; Six steps from the corner to the door.&nbsp; Twenty-nine.&nbsp; She had been close.

She stood by the door irresolutely.&nbsp; In the moonlit room, she could see the latch on the dead bolt to the right, and the lever on the door knob horizontal.&nbsp; Only a second to turn the lever vertical and the latch left.&nbsp; She opened the unlocked door a few inches.&nbsp; Closed it.&nbsp; Walked back to her bed, counting the steps again along the way.

Again she tried to sleep.&nbsp; 

This was a safe neighborhood.&nbsp; The main entrance door to the building was locked.&nbsp; Brad already had a key to her unit and could enter it, or let anyone he chose enter it, at any time.&nbsp; Having her own door unlocked really didn&#8217;t make any difference.&nbsp; But it did.&nbsp; As she lay there naked beneath the sheets, she felt decidedly more exposed and vulnerable.&nbsp; She should have timed it.&nbsp; Someone, anyone, could be on her in seconds.
�

Brad did not call her to his office the following noon.

At 8:28 that evening, Carol Edwards turned off the television, removed her shorts and t-shirt, folded them neatly, and knelt on the carpet.&nbsp; She removed her wristwatch, a Cartier gift from Ross on their fifth wedding anniversary, and placed it near where her face would be.&nbsp; Stretching out her arms caused her nipples to brush against the carpet.&nbsp; Palms down, she slid her knees farther apart, closed her eyes, and waited.

The position turned her on.&nbsp; She knew Brad was picturing her this way.&nbsp; She knew what anyone would see as they opened the door.&nbsp; And anyone could open the door.&nbsp; Would Brad come?&nbsp; Would he send someone else.&nbsp; Or more than one someone?&nbsp; Would Ravi or Faye or other neighbors knock and try the handle?&nbsp; Her cunt tingled, although she knew it would not likely be used.&nbsp; 

A sound.&nbsp; Her body tensed.&nbsp; The door opened.&nbsp; She strained to hear footsteps, but there were none.&nbsp; The door closed again.

When the hands of her watch reached 9:00, she struggled to her feet and poured herself a big glass of red wine.

The terminator--not Arnold, but the line separating day from night--does not move across the surface of the planet, it only seems to.&nbsp; Ross Edwards always remembered&nbsp; reading a poem in long ago days before business came to dominate his life that suggested Copernicus may not have done mankind a kindness when he proved that the sun does not revolve around us.&nbsp; For that matter Ross thought that while scientifically right, the Polish astronomer was emotionally wrong.&nbsp; Each of us is the center of our own universe and everyone else, everything else revolves around us.

Singapore had spun past the terminator and into darkness when he received the email in his apartment.&nbsp; Although he assumed that the subject line referred to California time, he clicked on the link, typed in the distressingly accurate password, and a window opened onto an empty room of long shadows and the low light near the other terminator 9,000 miles to the east.&nbsp; His room.&nbsp; His and Carol&#8217;s room.&nbsp; The living room of their condo in San Diego.

The view was from a high angle near the doorway.&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps above it.&nbsp;&nbsp; All of the living room was visible as was part of the dining area.&nbsp; He was startled by the sound of a door opening.&nbsp; The top of Carol&#8217;s head appeared, then her back disappearing around the corner to the corridor to the bedrooms.&nbsp; At this time of the morning, she could only be returning from her early rounds, about which Brad had considerately informed him.&nbsp; Ross wondered which of the neighbors she had just done.

He left the computer on, but the picture remained unchanged for almost an hour, before Carol reappeared for a few seconds, dressed for work, walking toward the door.&nbsp; Briefly&nbsp; she glanced up at the webcam before going out.

�


Ross checked the link several times the next morning.&nbsp; The live feed remained unchanged.

He tried to concentrate on his work, and even got a little done, before giving up and leaving the office at 10:00 a.m.

At 11:00 a.m. Singapore time. he was sitting naked in his living room, curtains drawn, idly stroking his cock, stopping from time to time to sip a gin and tonic--no longer did he wait until sunset for his first drink--while watching his other living room, which was empty but brightly illuminated.&nbsp; Not just the end table lamps, but all the recessed ceiling lights were on.

The room brought back memories.&nbsp; Good memories.&nbsp; They had made love there.&nbsp; They had been happy there.&nbsp; Or at least he thought they had been happy there.&nbsp; Would all this, or something like it, have happened anyway, even if he hadn&#8217;t followed his career to Singapore?&nbsp; He was beginning to think that it would have.&nbsp; That he was not at fault.&nbsp; That this, or the potential for it, must always have been buried within Carol, waiting to be unlocked.&nbsp; Although perhaps if he had stayed, the key would never have been found and turned.

At 11:28 Carol appeared from the left.&nbsp; Naked.&nbsp; She was breathtaking.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Literally.&nbsp; The picture was sharp and clear.&nbsp; Ross felt as though he were there with her.&nbsp; That he could reach out and touch her.&nbsp; For a moment all the anger and humiliating pain disappeared, and he so desperately wanted to touch her, to make love to her, to go back to the happier time before any of this had occurred.

Carol walked toward the camera and looked up and said, expressionlessly, �If you are watching, Ross, I&#8217;m to tell you that the door is unlocked.&nbsp; The door is always unlocked.�

Ross felt as though he were trapped behind a one-way mirror in a soundproof room, he cried out, �Carol!.�&nbsp; But of course she could not hear and turned away.&nbsp; 
 
Ross noticed that the floor to ceiling curtain to the balcony was pulled to the side.&nbsp; He did not need to be told that was Brad&#8217;s idea.&nbsp; People in several buildings father along the crest could see in.&nbsp; He wondered if any others were watching on the Internet.

She moved from the camera, from him, hips shifting, muscles flexing beneath tanned skin, her back and shoulders, Carol&#8217;s body, his wife&#8217;s body.&nbsp; 

She stopped, went to her knees, spread her thighs apart, lowered her head to the carpet, stretched out her arms full length.&nbsp;&nbsp; Light reflected off the wedding ring on her left hand.

The camera and Ross were looking directly between her legs.&nbsp;&nbsp; His eyes focused on her cunt, then her anus, then her cunt again.&nbsp; Back and forth.&nbsp; Eyes and his hand on his cock.&nbsp; He so wanted to be sinking his cock into her.&nbsp; 

For fourteen minutes, Carol knelt obediently.&nbsp; For fourteen minutes Ross stroked his cock slowly and sipped his drink.&nbsp; Both waiting for they knew not what.&nbsp; Both starting at the sound of the door.

A head appeared at the bottom of Ross&#8217;s screen, baseball cap with the bill to the back.&nbsp; Another.&nbsp; Then a knit skull cap.&nbsp; And a feathered Fedora.

�Will you look at that?�

�How not, my man?�

�Girl better than her pic.�

�I told you, bro.�

Four young black men, three in baggy jeans, unlaced boots, untucked oversize shirts to their knees, one in vested pimp suit, appeared on the screen.

�Shut the door, man.&nbsp; Don&#8217;t lock it.&nbsp; Man said not to lock it.�

They surrounded Carol, looking down.&nbsp; Through the blond veil of hair that had fallen forward and concealed her face, she saw three pairs of boots and one pair of extremely pointy black patent shoes.

�You been waiting for us girl?&nbsp; You prayers been answered.&nbsp; We is here.�

�And we is going to give you a fine time.�

�The time a you sweet life.�

�Man says you like be ridden hard.&nbsp; We hard riders.�

�That one fine ass.�

Ross watched the suit move, and Carol felt a shoe tip slide up her thigh, then start to push into her cunt.

�Not the cunt, bro.&nbsp; We can&#8217;t use the cunt&#8217;s cunt.&nbsp; We do that we never get to come back.�

She involuntarily flinched as the shoe tip touched her anus.

Black laughter.

�Wooo.&nbsp; Bitch don&#8217;t want you shoe up her ass.�

�Lift up.&nbsp; Let&#8217;s see yo tits and face.�

�Oh, my.�

�You a babe.&nbsp; How cum you do this?&nbsp; Kneel here and let strangers come in and fuck you?�

�Who cares, how come, man?&nbsp; Lez jus do it.�

A long black cock leapt out and slapped Carol in the face.&nbsp; She opened her mouth.&nbsp; It plunged in.

Clothes fell.&nbsp; Three of the black men were soon naked.&nbsp; One looked to be a mere boy.&nbsp; Maybe only sixteen.&nbsp; The others weren&#8217;t much older. 

Hands everywhere.&nbsp; Squeezing breasts.&nbsp; In her hair.&nbsp; On her ass.&nbsp; A painful finger buried itself knuckle deep in her ass.&nbsp; Rotated.&nbsp; Withdrew.&nbsp; �Bitch&#8217;s clean.�&nbsp;&nbsp; Hand slap cracked.&nbsp; �Good bitch.

Pimp suit remained fully dressed.&nbsp; He never even removed his hat.&nbsp; Just unzipped and pulled out his cock.

Carol Edwards had discovered that she liked being manhandled.&nbsp; Lifted.&nbsp; Pulled.&nbsp; Turned.&nbsp; Forced.&nbsp; Cock after cock in her mouth.&nbsp; Thrusting for her throat.&nbsp; Gagging.&nbsp; Head bobbing.&nbsp; Spinning.&nbsp; Dizzy from lack of air.&nbsp; Almost passing out.&nbsp; Sensations multiplying.&nbsp; A cock up her ass.&nbsp; Mouth.&nbsp; Ass.&nbsp; Mouth.&nbsp; Ass.&nbsp; Pain from nipple twisted.&nbsp; �Fuck back, ho.&nbsp; Take it up.&nbsp; Bury that black bone in you white ho ass.�

Thousands of miles to the west, Ross was about to come.&nbsp; He didn&#8217;t want to yet.&nbsp; Unwound his fingers from his cock.&nbsp; But it was too late.&nbsp; A fountain of come spurted up and fell back onto his belly.

Carol Edwards was on her hands and knees.&nbsp; Pimp suit was behind her.&nbsp; One of the others on his back on the floor in front of her.&nbsp;&nbsp; All off the carpet.&nbsp; Hardwood brutal against knees.

�Take it all, girl.&nbsp; Man said you deep throat.&nbsp; Eat all that nigger cock.�&nbsp; 

Buried too deep to taste, she gagged on the spasms as come slid down her throat.

Flipped onto her back.&nbsp; �Floor be killin me.�&nbsp; Dragged onto the carpet again.&nbsp; Carpet burning her back.&nbsp; Over to the sofa.&nbsp; Black hands on tanned legs.&nbsp; Lifted the lower half of her body vertical.&nbsp; Propped her against the sofa upside down.&nbsp;&nbsp; Ass in the air.&nbsp; Head on carpet.&nbsp; Ankles pulled apart and down.&nbsp; Pile-driving black cock after cock in her ass.&nbsp; Fingers circled her throat and squeezed.&nbsp; The men who used her are doing this more frequently, Carol thought.&nbsp; Faye too.&nbsp; Brad must tell them to.&nbsp; Suffocating.&nbsp; About to black out.&nbsp; Cock pounding in and out her ass.&nbsp; Instinctive struggle.&nbsp; Can&#8217;t breath.&nbsp; Cock filling her bowels with come.&nbsp; Fingers releasing.&nbsp; Gasping in air.&nbsp; Blocked by meat pushing apart her lips.&nbsp; New meat shoving up her ass.&nbsp; Teeth biting nipple.&nbsp; Sensations blurring.&nbsp;&nbsp; Her mouth tasted come.&nbsp;&nbsp; Deflating cock slipped out.&nbsp; A black big toe entered.&nbsp; She licked and sucked it.

Ross was again jerking his cock frantically.&nbsp; Seeing stills.&nbsp; Hearing audios.&nbsp; Even videos.&nbsp; Knowing it was happening and imagining. Was nothing like this.&nbsp; This was happening now.&nbsp; This very instant. The camera angle didn&#8217;t change.&nbsp; He couldn&#8217;t see everything.&nbsp; Bodies got in the way.&nbsp; But he could see enough.&nbsp; These black bastards were fucking the shit out of his wife.&nbsp; Well, not literally.&nbsp; One of them had said she was clean.&nbsp; He could feel their cocks in her.&nbsp; He wanted it to be him.&nbsp; What?&nbsp; He wanted to feel their cocks in him?&nbsp; He remembered how big the dildo felt in his ass.&nbsp; How it hurt.&nbsp; How hard he had come.&nbsp; Or he wanted to be them and feel his cock in her?&nbsp; It was all confused.&nbsp; His cock flooded again.

A lull.&nbsp; The four men had come twice each.&nbsp; Two sprawled on the sofa.&nbsp; Pimp suit lolled in a brushed steel and coffee brown leather chair.&nbsp; The fourth lay on the floor, beside Carol, whose face down, shuddering body he had just rolled off of.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

�You one fine fuck, lady.�

�Should buy the ho from the man.&nbsp; Put her on the street.&nbsp; Make a fortune.�

Carol Edwards heard them, and her insane flesh responded to the&nbsp; thought of being a street whore.&nbsp; She wondered if Brad would do it.&nbsp; If she would let herself be sold?&nbsp; If she could prevent it?&nbsp; For that matter it wouldn&#8217;t be much different.&nbsp; Anyone could have her now.&nbsp; She didn&#8217;t choose.&nbsp; And if she were whoring, some of them would use her cunt.&nbsp; She&#8217;d get to come more.&nbsp; She already took cock from dawn to night.&nbsp; And she ate cunt. They just didn&#8217;t have to pay.&nbsp; And, she reminded herself, they were clean.&nbsp; At least she assumed Brad still was certain they were clean.&nbsp; For himself, if not for her.

�Floor too fucking hard, man.&nbsp; Bedroom back there?�

�Yes,� she croaked.

�Lez go.�

The youngest looked at his watch.&nbsp; �I gotta go.&nbsp; Had enouff.&nbsp; For now, anyway, you sweet thing.&nbsp; But I be back.�

�Me too.&nbsp; School tomorrow.&nbsp; I home much later, my momma kill me.�

They started to gather their clothes.

�Well I ain&#8217;t.�&nbsp; 

�Me neither.�&nbsp; 

Pimp suit pulled Carol Edwards up by her hair and led her off screen, stooped over, breasts swaying, followed by the one black man still naked, who reminded the other two, �Doan lock the door on you way out.�

For over an hour Ross Edwards watched his computer screen.&nbsp; A few sounds carried.&nbsp; He couldn&#8217;t be certain what they were.&nbsp; A man coming?&nbsp; Slaps?&nbsp; Flesh against flesh?&nbsp; A scream of pain or pleasure?

Finally he shut down. 

He had left the computer once to take a piss and another time to mix a new drink.&nbsp; Perhaps they had left then and he had missed them.&nbsp; Perhaps they were spending the night.

Ross Edwards began to hate business lunches.&nbsp; 

He couldn&#8217;t avoid them.&nbsp; They went with the job.&nbsp; Lunches with staff, with suppliers, lawyers, bankers, customers, prospects, investors, partners.&nbsp;&nbsp; 

His mind was never fully there.&nbsp; He set the computer to record the live feed to hard drive; but it wasn&#8217;t the same.&nbsp;&nbsp; Viewing the recording later in his office, or sometimes not until that evening back in his apartment, of what had already occurred lacked the intense immediacy of knowing that what he was seeing was happening at that very instant.

The only advantage of being in his apartment was that he could get completely naked and shove the black dildo up his ass while he masturbated.&nbsp; He shared that with her:&nbsp; full asses.&nbsp; His with dildo; hers with strange cocks.&nbsp; 

He had never been attracted to men.&nbsp; Had never thought of himself as gay or bi.&nbsp; He didn&#8217;t now.&nbsp; And he would never let Carol or Brad know what they were doing to him.&nbsp; He would never even give them the satisfaction of knowing he was watching.&nbsp;&nbsp; But they knew.

...

There was no pattern.&nbsp; Brad Tomalin saw to that.

Sometimes Ross would watch Carol kneel submissively for two or three nights in a row for the prescribed half hour and no one else appeared.&nbsp; This was almost worse.&nbsp; Tension building and building.

And sometimes men would be there night after night.&nbsp; Sometimes the same man or men for several successive nights.&nbsp; 

For Carol it was better when they were.&nbsp; Just kneeling, waiting, she could sense her husband&#8217;s eyes on her.&nbsp; She could actually feel the heat of his gaze, though she knew that was not possible.&nbsp; The heat came from her own flushed flesh.&nbsp; 

We all act differently when we know we are observed, and while she could never be certain, she always assumed she was being observed.&nbsp; The position was servile and shameless.&nbsp; As was she.&nbsp; She felt no shame.&nbsp; She was eager for the men to come because once they did, she lost herself in the things they did to her and made her do for them.

Ross saw that, saw her face change as she was used--when he could see her face.&nbsp; Her&nbsp; features soften, her eyes glaze with lust, even roll back.&nbsp; Sometimes they made her beg for it; sometimes she begged anyway.

The camera, he decided, must be hidden.&nbsp; The men never seemed aware of it.&nbsp; Only Carol and, of course, Brad Tomalin.&nbsp; And possibly Faye, but about her Ross was not certain.

Faye had appeared twice.

When her close cropped gray head had first moved across the screen, Ross had thought it was a man.&nbsp; Wearing jeans and a long sleeved shirt, from the back she looked like a man as she walked toward Carol.&nbsp; Only when she spoke, almost regretfully, did he realize his mistake.

�I wish you didn&#8217;t do this.&nbsp; I could��&nbsp; Faye stopped and after a moment reached down and caressed the bare back.&nbsp; �Get up.�

As Carol straightened up, Faye took her hand and helped her to her feet.&nbsp; The same height.&nbsp; Eye to eye.&nbsp; Faye put her arms around Carol and kissed her.&nbsp; A long kiss.&nbsp; Voluptuous naked flesh pressed against hard clothed body.

When the kiss finally ended, Faye led Carol to the sofa.&nbsp; �On your back.�

Carol lay down. 

�Your head at this end.�&nbsp; It was the end toward the camera.

Her back to the camera, Faye undressed. 

Ross had never even seen her in a bathing suit.&nbsp; Her body dropped straight from the shoulders.&nbsp; No waist.&nbsp; No hips. 
.&nbsp; 
As she climbed onto the sofa into a 69 position, swinging her left leg over Carol&#8217;s head, he had a glimpse of her angular chest.

Flat ass descended onto Carol&#8217;s face.&nbsp; �Lick it.&nbsp; Lick it all.�&nbsp; Ross saw his wife&#8217;s pink tongue extend, disappear between folds.&nbsp; Faye sighed and ground back and forth.&nbsp; �Oh.&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; Like that.&nbsp; Now back.&nbsp; No.&nbsp; My ass.&nbsp; That&#8217;s good.&nbsp; Very good.&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; My cunt.&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; Yes.� 

Her own head fell forward between Carol&#8217;s parted thighs.&nbsp; 

In seconds, Carol had stopped licking.&nbsp; Her head arched back.&nbsp; Face upside down to the camera.&nbsp; �Please.&nbsp; Don&#8217;t stop.&nbsp; Please.&nbsp; I need to come so much.&nbsp; I love it.&nbsp; I love it.&nbsp; Please.&nbsp; Oh, God.&nbsp; Oh, God.&nbsp; Please.&nbsp; Pleaaaughhh!�

Faye waited for Carol&#8217;s convulsions to end before saying almost gently, �Now finish me.�

And Ross Edwards watched his wife make love to another woman.&nbsp; It was, he thought, making love.&nbsp; Or more like it than anything else he had seen happen in that room.

�

Five nights later Faye appeared again.&nbsp; This time Ross recognized her immediately.

She was dressed in jeans, man&#8217;s shirt, and boots, and was carrying a plastic bag from which she removed a 10� flesh colored strap on.

Not undressing, she stepped into the straps, pulled them up over her jeans, knelt behind Carol&#8217;s upraised hips, spit on her hand, rubbed the spit on the end of the artificial penis and brutally shoved it up that beautiful ass.

Carol screamed.&nbsp; Ross saw her outstretched fingers clench into fists.&nbsp; But she remained in position as Fay fucked her like a metronome for ten minutes, pulled out, stood up, put the strap on back in its bag and leave wordlessly 

Carol knelt sobbing for another minute or two, before getting to her feet and, face averted, disappeared off screen.

�

Brad Tomalin played to his audience.&nbsp; Although he never looked directly at the camera or spoke to Ross, they all knew.

The first night the hated figure appeared on the screen, Brad went and sat in the stainless and leather chair fully dressed, and ordered Carol to suck him off.&nbsp; Is this all? Ross wondered.&nbsp; But as he watched his wife&#8217;s bobbing head he realized:&nbsp; it was a recreation of the image in that very first devastating email.

�

Another night. 

Brad entered and stripped.&nbsp; He was justly proud of his strong body.&nbsp; Without acknowledging the camera he presented himself from the best angles.&nbsp; He does have a good cock, Ross thought; but then, feeling what was in his hand, so do I.

Brad turned Carol around, so that she was facing the camera.

�What do you want?�

�Whatever you want.�

�What are you?�

�Whatever you want me to be.�

�My slut?�

�Your slut.�

�My whore?�

�Your whore.�

�My slave?�

�Your slave.�

�My cum bucket?�

�Your cum bucket.�&#8232;
�Piss mop?�

&#8216;Your piss mop.�

(What? thought Ross)

�And what will you do?�

�Anything.&nbsp; Everything�

�Anything?�

�Anything.�

�Fuck anybody and anything? ...&nbsp;&nbsp; Are you hesitating?�

�No.&nbsp; Yes.�

�Which is it?�

�No.�

�Then&nbsp; you&#8217;ll suffer for me?�

�I already do.�

�Give me your pain?�

�Yes.�

�You&#8217;ll fuck anybody and anything?�

�Yes.�

�Fuck a dog?�

�Don&#8217;t make me do that.&nbsp; Please.�

�Fuck a dog?�

Finally, �Yes.�

�Yes what?�

�I&#8217;ll fuck a dog.�

(No, thought Ross.&nbsp; She couldn&#8217;t.)

On screen, Carol grunted as Brad entered her.&nbsp; From the angle Ross couldn&#8217;t tell where, but he assumed her ass as usual. 

Brad reached forward and pulled Carol&#8217;s head back by her hair, holding her face directly toward the camera.&nbsp; 

His hands dropped, fingers fish-hooked her mouth, stretching it into a painfully wide grimace, from which droll streamed.

�

Another night.

Brad Tomalin stood naked in front of the rosewood coffee table sideways to the camera, cock jutting proudly.&nbsp; Carol Edwards knelt behind him.&nbsp; Her face buried in his ass.&nbsp; Her breasts rubbed the backs of his thighs.&nbsp; Her tongue busy.&nbsp; When he told her, �Start stroking my cock,�&nbsp; her right hand reached around and began a rhythm&nbsp; that was matched by her tongue and Ross&#8217;s hand 9,000 miles away.

Brad came without a sound.&nbsp; Ross was noisier.&nbsp; Brad&#8217;s come arched out and fell onto rosewood.&nbsp; Ross&#8217;s on his fingers and belly.

�Lick it up,� Brad ordered.

Ross watched his wife lower her head.&nbsp; Brad reached down and pulled her hair to the side so the camera could see her red lips suck goo from wood.&nbsp; 

Ross brought his fingers to his mouth.

�

Another night.

Obviously Brad gave Carol instructions in advance.&nbsp; Probably while he does her in his office at lunch, Ross thought.&nbsp; Because some nights instead of leaving her arms stretched out servilely, at the sound of the door opening Carol reached back with both hands and spread her ass cheeks wide.

She had done so this night, and held herself open as Brad stripped off his clothes and fucked her ass where she knelt, forcing a grunt from her on each inward thrust.&nbsp; 

Repeatedly he pulled out all the way, smiled down at the gaping O clearly visible to the camera, before slamming in to the hilt again.

�

Another night.

There was something odd about Carol when she came into view:&nbsp; she had a tail.&nbsp; 

When she knelt, Ross saw that the two foot long tail of straight black hair sprouted from a red butt plug.

A few minutes later Brad entered accompanied by two men Ross had never seen before.&nbsp; Seeing Carol, they all laughed.

�I told you.&nbsp; A well trained pet.�

�Not to mention beautiful,� said one of the strangers.

�And accommodating,� continued Brad.

�Stand up.&nbsp; Turn around.&nbsp; Your back toward us.�&nbsp; Which was also toward the camera.&nbsp; �Wiggle it.�

Between shoulders, Ross saw Carol awkwardly wiggle her hips.&nbsp;&nbsp; Her tail swung side to side.

�Good dog.&nbsp; Come along and you can fetch bones.�&nbsp; 

Brad took her by the upper arm, like a police officer escorting a prisoner, and they all disappeared from view.

�

Another night.

Brad entered, walked past Carol to the sofa.&nbsp; �Crawl over here.�

She did.

�Arms out.&nbsp; Put your hands on either side of the leg.�&nbsp; 

He took a pair of handcuffs from his pocket and snapped them on her wrists, gave her ass a resounding slap, and left.

The sofa leg was a 3� square and 1� high block of wood.&nbsp; Carol could never get leverage to lift the sofa and free herself.&nbsp; She was trapped.&nbsp; At the unlikely mercy of anyone who came through the door.&nbsp; But no one did.

Ross watched the hand print on her ass become redder, then he had to go to a meeting.

He looked in from time to time and found his wife sleeping on the floor.

�

Another night.

A woman&#8217;s voice, laughing.

�You were serious.�

�Of course.&nbsp; Why would I lie?�

Ross saw Brad Tomalin and a black haired woman enter the screen.&nbsp; Her white sheath dress left tanned shoulders bare and stopped mid-thigh.&nbsp; They were lovely shoulders.&nbsp; They were lovely thighs.&nbsp; And calves.&nbsp; And ankles above white high heels.&nbsp; And when she turned, her face was lovely, too.&nbsp; If she wasn&#8217;t quite as beautiful as Carol, she was close.

�And she kneels here every evening, waiting for whoever comes along?�

�Tell her.�

Without turning her nose-down-in-the-carpet face, Carol Edwards said, �Yes.�

�What a slut.&nbsp; Can I have her one night.&nbsp; Me and my girl friends?�

�Why not?�

Carol had not been told to move, so she didn&#8217;t, remaining kneeling, arms stretched forward this evening, while they undressed.

Ross saw that the woman&#8217;s breasts were smaller than Carol&#8217;s, but high and firm and perfectly formed.&nbsp; Her hard nipples were smaller, too, but then most women&#8217;s were.

Carol heard the sounds and Ross watched fascinated as the black haired woman went to her knees and began sucking on Brad.

After a few minutes, he pushed her onto her back so close that when she opened her knees, one pressed against Carol&#8217;s thigh.

Now Carol could see from the corner of her eye.&nbsp; Brad kissed the dark haired woman&#8217;s mouth, nipples, thighs.&nbsp; She made small sounds of pleasure.&nbsp; Knee dug into Carol&#8217;s thigh as Brad licked the woman&#8217;s cunt, bringing her higher and higher, giving her the orgasm he denied Carol.&nbsp; Is there no end to the ways the man invents&nbsp; to torture me, she thought as the woman noisily came.

Brad gave the black haired woman a moment, before rolling her over and pulling her to her knees.&nbsp; Two beautiful women in identical poses.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bodies melding together.&nbsp; Forearms touching, shoulders, hips, thighs, legs, the sides of their feet.

An intake of breath from the woman as Brad entered her.

�Turn your face so I can see you,� she told Carol.

She reached over and brushed away blond hair.&nbsp; �You are beautiful.�

�So are you.�

Only inches separated their faces.&nbsp;&nbsp; Carol could feel the heat of the other&#8217;s breath.&nbsp; Feel the jolt of Brad&#8217;s thrusts into her body.&nbsp; The woman squeezed her eyes closed.&nbsp; �Fuck me.&nbsp; Fuck me.�&nbsp; Yet to Carol it was almost as though Brad were fucking her through the other woman&#8217;s flesh.&nbsp; 

Ross could not believe what he was watching.&nbsp; He had never seen anything so erotic.

�I&#8217;m coming.�&nbsp; The woman screamed.&nbsp; �I&#8217;m coming.�

�So,� grunted Brad, who never made much noise during sex, so Carol assumed this was for her benefit.&nbsp; �So am I.�&nbsp; 

The dark haired beauty collapsed forward.

Brad reached over and pulled Carol Edwards head to his cock.

�Clean it.�

Because of the orgasm, she had thought he had been in the woman&#8217;s cunt, but the cock tasted of ass.&nbsp; 

The woman sat up.&nbsp; �I&#8217;m famished.&nbsp; Ready for dinner?�

They dressed and left Carol sitting on the floor.&nbsp; Naked.&nbsp; Empty.&nbsp; Alone.

�
 

A few evenings the living room remained empty, and Ross wondered where Carol was and what was happening to her.

Ross watched with increasing horror as she reappeared after one such absence, shuffling like an old woman, her body revealing as it came into focus massive bruises on back and breasts, ass and thighs.&nbsp; Not inadvertent bruises such as those following the first gangbang, but severe bruises of deliberate torture.&nbsp; 

Carol groaned with pain as she eased slowly into position.

Her ass to the camera was crisscrossed by welts. 









17

�Are you starting to pay me now?�&nbsp; Carol Edwards had asked four days earlier.

She was on the floor of Brad Tomalin&#8217;s office, on her side, her head propped up on her right elbow.

�No,� said Brad, as he placed five one hundred dollar bills on his desk.&nbsp; �These are for a new dress.�

Carol sat upright and looked at him quizzically.

�I&#8217;m giving you to a man Friday night.&nbsp; A car will pick you up at 8.&nbsp; He likes to tear the clothes off women, and fuck them while they&#8217;re crying.&nbsp; I know you can afford it, but I think he should pay for the one-wear dress.&nbsp; Buy something stylish.&nbsp; Something similar to what you were wearing to that charity thing the night we met would be good.&nbsp; He likes to rape ladies, not tramps.&nbsp; And although we both know what you are,� and he made an encompassing gesture toward where she sat naked in midday, with a drop of come in the corner of her mouth, �you can still pass.�

�He is going to hurt me?�

�Yes.&nbsp; Yes he is.&nbsp; Quite severely, I expect.�

�For how long?�

Brad laughed.&nbsp; �Until he lets you go.&nbsp; His car will return you home.

�Wear lingerie:&nbsp; bra, panties, garter belt, nylons.&nbsp;&nbsp; Lacy, sexy, elegant not trampy.&nbsp; More for him to rip off.

�And there are other instructions��


�

�Open your mouth.�

Though spoken conversationally, the words knifed through the illusion that they were two normal people having evening cocktails. 

Upon her arrival a half hour earlier, he had introduced himself as, �Ooni,� but it hadn&#8217;t been necessary.&nbsp; 

 �I know who you are.&nbsp; Oblivion&#8217;s drummer.&nbsp; I saw you perform live at the old Jack Murphy stadium when I was a teenager.�

He was pleased.&nbsp; A good start.&nbsp; She didn&#8217;t want him angry with her.

Oblivion was a rock group that made lifetimes of money in a few years in the early 90s before breaking up.&nbsp; She seemed to remember that he was from Sweden or Finland.&nbsp; Somewhere in Scandinavia.&nbsp; His English, though, was American.

For a while he was a model host, showing her into the spacious living room in the California Mission style house, overlooking a wide lawn sloping gradually to a stand of tall Eucalyptus trees on a hill north of San Diego and inland from Del Mar; asking politely what she would like to drink; mixing and pouring her martini, placing it on a coaster on the end table beside a two piece right-angled sectional; pouring himself a glass of champagne; taking a seat at the far end of the other piece of the sectional; complimenting her on how beautiful she looked, and on her dress; and carrying on the usual meaningless cocktail conversation about weather, climate change which could only have deleterious effects San Diego&#8217;s already perfect climate, recent movies, a book he was reading in which Rebecca West wrote that conversation is an illusion because there really are only intersecting monologues.&nbsp; They both laughed.

Carol&#8217;s dress was of flowing blue and green silk, cut high front and back and reaching to just above her knees.&nbsp; She had chosen it for&nbsp; style and because she thought it would tear easily.&nbsp; Never before had that been a consideration.&nbsp; Just to be safe, she had made a tiny cut in the neckline with fingernail scissors.&nbsp; Carol liked the dress and was sorry she&#8217;d never get to wear it again.

During the seemingly interminable inconsequential chit-chat, she tried to keep her eyes on Ooni, but they were continually drawn to objects on a old dark wood serving table behind him.

Hastily she swallowed the sip of martini she had just taken and opened her mouth.

�Run your tongue over your lips.&nbsp; Slowly.&nbsp; Top.&nbsp; Bottom.&nbsp;&nbsp; Make them glisten.&nbsp; Good.�

Carol felt herself trembling.&nbsp; A muscle in her flat abdomen twitched.

�Now tell me all the ways that mouth can bring me pleasure.�

�I can kiss you.�

Silence.

�And I can lick you.�

�Where?�

�Anywhere you want.&nbsp; And I can suck you.�

Silence stretched.

�And...And I can talk to you.�

�Is that all?�

�All I can think of.�

�What about scream?&nbsp;&nbsp; Don&#8217;t you think it would bring me pleasure to hear you scream?�

�Y..yes.�

�And beg?&nbsp; Plead for mercy.&nbsp; Beg me to stop.&nbsp; Beg me to let you come?&nbsp; Which, by the way, Brad says I can if I chose.�

�Yes.�

�You look like a lady, but you are just another slut, aren&#8217;t you?&nbsp; Opening your mouth when a man you&#8217;ve just met tells you to.&nbsp; You&#8217;re not just another slut, you are the biggest slut of all.�&nbsp; Words were coming faster, piling on top of one another, and his voice rising.&nbsp; Abruptly that ended, and conversational again, �Did you know my wife left me?�

�No.&nbsp; Recently?�

�A long time ago.�&nbsp; As he spoke he seemed to forget about Carol Edwards and be looking within himself.&nbsp; �For another musician.&nbsp; Another drummer even.&nbsp; And not as big a band.&nbsp; He sells insurance now.&nbsp; They have a couple of kids.�&nbsp; And then he came back to the present.&nbsp; �You&#8217;re wearing a ring.�

Carol nodded.

�So where&#8217;s your husband?�

�Asia.�

�A big place, Asia.&nbsp; We toured there twice.&nbsp; Where in Asia?�

�At the moment Bangalore, India.&nbsp; I think.�

�You think?�

�I don&#8217;t...We don&#8217;t...I don&#8217;t hear from him everyday.�

�Does he know where you are?�

�You mean here in your house?&nbsp; I didn&#8217;t know until I got here.�

�I mean generally.&nbsp; He knows you are with other men?&nbsp; That you fuck them and do anything they want, no matter how vile?�

�Yes.�

�Does he know that you voluntarily came to a man who is going to make you scream?�

�I...I think so.�

�Again, &#8216;think.&#8217; �

�I think Brad emailed him.�

�And what does your husband think of all this?�

�He thinks I&#8217;m crazy.�

�And what do you think?�

�He may be right.�

Ooni laughed.

�Do you think he would like to hear you scream?�

�I don&#8217;t know...Probably.&nbsp; I&#8217;ve hurt him.�&nbsp; Immediately she realized that was the wrong thing to say.

This laugh from Ooni was more troubling.

�I&#8217;ll punish you for him.&nbsp; I&#8217;ll make you scream for him.&nbsp; For us all.&nbsp; I&#8217;ll beat you like a drum.�

He smiled and went on matter-of-factly.

�An old expression, but I&#8217;ve found it true.&nbsp; The best drum is a woman&#8217;s body.&nbsp; Don&#8217;t know about men.&nbsp; Might be the same.&nbsp; Probably is.

�But a woman&#8217;s body is great.&nbsp; Different sounds from different parts.&nbsp; Ass, breasts, back, legs, soles of feet.&nbsp; All different sounds.&nbsp; Call for different strokes, different rhythms.&nbsp; And the cries and screams and begging are the lyrics.&nbsp; The body is the drum; the screams the lead singer.&nbsp; I improvise the lyrics, too.&nbsp; Loud and soft.&nbsp; Fast and slow.&nbsp; It&#8217;s an art.&nbsp; And I&#8217;m a good drummer.&nbsp; Always was.&nbsp; The best.�

Carol felt her body shaking.

�You&#8217;re shaking.&nbsp; Good.&nbsp; You&#8217;re afraid.&nbsp; What else are you feeling, knowing that soon you will be naked and helpless before me?�

�I am afraid.&nbsp; And curious.�

�Excited?&nbsp; Aroused?&nbsp; I&#8217;ll bet your cunt is wet.�

�Yes.�

�What did Brad tell you about me?�

�That you like to rip women&#8217;s clothes off and make them cry.�

�And you still came tonight?�

�Obviously.�

�Did he tell you anything else.�

�To have my...rear clean.&nbsp; To wear mascara.&nbsp; Water based.�

�And why do you suppose I specified that?�

�I don&#8217;t know.�

�So that it will run down your face when you cry.�

�Oh.�

�What do you think of my toys?�&nbsp; He gestured over his shoulder.

�I don&#8217;t know.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t know what some of them are.�

�Come.&nbsp; I&#8217;ll show you.�&nbsp; And he stood and held out his hand.&nbsp;&nbsp; 

Although her heels were only a modest 2 �� high, Carol got unsteadily to her feet and put her hand in his.&nbsp; Both their palms were damp.

Circling the sectional, he led her to the table.

�You recognize some of these.�&nbsp; Pointing to several pair of Vice-grips.&nbsp; A battery operated electric drill.&nbsp; Plastic electrical ties of various sizes.&nbsp; Duct tape.&nbsp; A three foot length of clear plastic �� diameter hose. �Home Depot is a great place for S and M.&nbsp; Don&#8217;t worry about the drill.&nbsp; There&#8217;s a dildo attachment.&nbsp; And the ties are perfect for all sorts of things:&nbsp; wrists, ankles, breasts.&nbsp; You have big ones.&nbsp; Secure these around the base.&nbsp; Tighten them down.&nbsp; Watch the pressure build up.&nbsp; Your breasts turn purple with trapped blood.&nbsp; The sound changes then.&nbsp; But they do leave marks.

�For your sake, I hope you followed instructions.&nbsp; The hose is for you to suck my come out of your ass.�

Spread out on display were whips, various leather and metal collars and cuffs,&nbsp; a leather hood with a metal ring at the top and zippers at mouth and nose; a full body black latex suit, also with strategically placed zippers.&nbsp; �For when I just want the essentials,�&nbsp; Ooni said.&nbsp; 

A box with wires running from it like a battery charger sat next to something that resembled an electric shaver.&nbsp; �A stun gun,� he explained, picking it up and pocketing it.&nbsp; 

�These,� he said pointing to a pile of individually wrapped vials, �are surgical needles.&nbsp; Sterile.&nbsp; Where do you think I should place them?�&nbsp; When she did not reply, his drummer-strong hand still holding hers squeezed hard.&nbsp; �Where?�

�Ohh.&nbsp; Please.&nbsp; Sensitive places.&nbsp; My breasts.�

�And?�

�Not my vagina?�

�Why not your cunt?&nbsp; Your clit?&nbsp; Your ass?&nbsp; All over?�

Abruptly he stopped crushing her hand and released it.&nbsp; 

Ooni was having trouble controlling his breathing, and Carol Edwards wondered if he was insane or on drugs, or both, and was terrified.&nbsp; This man could kill her, mutilate her.&nbsp; What had Brad gotten her into?&nbsp; She glanced around, desperately seeking a way to escape.

�The trouble,� Ooni said, �Is that you are already such a slut that many of the things I like to do to married whores like you, Brad tells me you are used to, already do routinely.&nbsp; Ah, well, I will have to be creative.�&nbsp; 

The bony man turned abruptly.&nbsp;&nbsp; A blur of motion.&nbsp; Blinding pain exploded in Carol Edward&#8217;s mid-section, and she found herself writhing on the floor, gasping for air.&nbsp; Instantly he was on her, grabbing the collar of her dress, ripping down, pulling the shreds from her shoulders, fingernails slashing at the lacy light blue bra that matched her eyes, digging into her breasts.&nbsp; �You didn&#8217;t think,� he hissed, �that just because you are willing, I wouldn&#8217;t rape you.�

The lovely dress tore all the way down.&nbsp; Matching blue garter belt and panties dug into her flesh as they were pulled off.

Carol was still trying to breath.&nbsp; She wasn&#8217;t even sure what had happened.&nbsp; Had he punched her?&nbsp;&nbsp; Used the stun gun?&nbsp; Her shoes had fallen off.&nbsp; Only ripped nylons clung to her lower legs.&nbsp; Rough hands and teeth everywhere.&nbsp; She was being raped, and fought back instinctively, scratching at his face.&nbsp; Drawing blood.

�Bitch.�&nbsp; And this time she saw his fist slam into her gut.

Her legs forced apart.&nbsp; His cock free of his pants.&nbsp; �You are sopping, slut.&nbsp; You love it.�&nbsp; And he pounded her brutally against the floor.

�

All the rooms had high ceilings.&nbsp; This one was twelve feet, Carol Edwards thought as her eyes followed the rope from leather wrist cuffs to a pulley.&nbsp; Her head was behind her arms and she could not look forward, only up or to the sides.&nbsp; The rope was taut.&nbsp; Her body, now stripped even of the tattered stockings, stretched full length.&nbsp; Swaying, striving to balance on the very tips of her toes.&nbsp; To the sides she saw herself endlessly reflected in a continuous wall of 7&#8217; mirrors that lined the room.&nbsp; Reflections reflecting helpless reflections.

Now, naked too, looking more corpse than man, Ooni entered the room.

�You do have a body.&nbsp; Even stretched like that, your tits haven&#8217;t flattened.&nbsp; 

�I want you to feel something.�&nbsp; He held up the stun gun.&nbsp; �I&#8217;ve never experienced it myself, so can&#8217;t say first hand, but all women say it is the worst.�

�No.&nbsp; Please.�

�I told you you would beg.&nbsp; Now scream.�&nbsp; He touched the device to her right nipple&nbsp; and she did. briefly, before blacking out.

�

�Come on.&nbsp; Come on.&nbsp; We don&#8217;t have all night.&nbsp; Unfortunately.�&nbsp; 

To the sharp smell of ammonia, Carol regained consciousness.

Ooni was holding something under her nose and slapping her face, not hard.

�There.&nbsp; That&#8217;s better.�

�No more.&nbsp; Please no more.�

�Oh, there is more.&nbsp; Some time when we have more time, I will take time.&nbsp; But I want to finish your introduction.�

Blue eyes in lolling head watched his scrawny ass move away.&nbsp; A cranking sound.&nbsp; Pressure on her wrists and arms.&nbsp; Toes scrambling wildly for vanishing floor.&nbsp; When the cranking stopped the strain on her arms and shoulders was immense.&nbsp; In the reflections the gap between the floor and her toes was six inches.

He was back beside her.&nbsp; His breath in her face.&nbsp; Right hand found her right breast.&nbsp; Left hand the crack of her ass.&nbsp; Pulling on nipple, pushing on ass, he put her in motion.&nbsp; Swinging a pendulum.&nbsp; A motion he continued with a bullwhip.

The whip cracked, snaked around her body, between shoulders and thighs, bruising but not quite breaking skin, wrapped, spun her as it unwound.&nbsp; Caused unbearable pain and promised screams.&nbsp; And running mascara.

�You are starting to look like an owl,� he observed, when he finally lowered her, sobbing to the floor, and rolled her onto her belly.

Her body on fire with pain, Carol Edwards hardly noticed the cock enter her ass, until it emptied and withdrew and was replaced by something smaller but harder.

�Here,� Ooni said, rolling her onto her back and placing the other end of the plastic tube in her mouth.&nbsp; �Suck.�

She did.&nbsp; 

Though tears she saw him leaning over her with a video camera, photographing the tainted fluid flowing through the tube.

�

An hour later they were in a bed.&nbsp; She was crying.

�Do you want to come?�

Hating herself, she nodded between sobs.

�Then climb on.�

Her body hurt.&nbsp; Not as much as it would in a few hours when it stiffened.&nbsp; She winced as she swung a leg over him, and gasped at the now rare sensation of a cock, a hard, real cock, in her cunt.&nbsp;&nbsp; Ooni lay still, hie hands crossed behind his head.&nbsp; Smiling.&nbsp; Letting her do all the work.&nbsp; 

Lifting and lowering hips.&nbsp; A sea of pain penetrated by pleasure.


18

She healed.&nbsp; Or at least her body did.&nbsp; And life flowed on.&nbsp; Though a river deeper and darker.&nbsp; Like any addict, she built up tolerance and needed ever stronger dosages of her drug of choice.

Carol Edwards had a beautiful mind.&nbsp; The Ancient Greek ideal:&nbsp; a sound mind in a sound body.&nbsp; Well, perhaps not so sound, or so beautiful, any more.

Though that mind was becoming increasingly irrelevant to her life, she sometimes paused to wonder what was happening to it.&nbsp;&nbsp; Sex, real and anticipated, released hormones and chemicals.&nbsp; While she had always enjoyed sex; in the past, except at the very start of a few relationships, she was having sex or anticipating sex only at scattered intervals.&nbsp; A few times a week.&nbsp; The chemicals flooded her brain and then were washed away.&nbsp; Now they were always there.&nbsp; She was always having sex, or just had, or was about to.&nbsp; Hormones and the semen of several men were always in her body.&nbsp; She wondered if there were toxic levels.&nbsp; 

She was fucking so much it was changing her body.&nbsp; That and less sleep.&nbsp; She had lost a few pounds, which she didn&#8217;t need to.&nbsp; Was more limber and supple.&nbsp; More toned.&nbsp; As though she worked out for two or three hours a day.&nbsp; Which she did.&nbsp; But not in a gym.&nbsp; She sensed her brain, constantly bathed in corroding sexual chemicals and stimuli, was changing too.&nbsp; Surely it was being re-wired.&nbsp; Some connections atrophying; some grotesquely strengthened.

One thing that had definitely changed was that Brad was permitting her more orgasms.&nbsp; And the more she had, the more she wanted, even though she was fully aware of what he was doing:&nbsp; he was perverting her.&nbsp; Ross might not know that he was a lab rat, but she knew she was.

She never had what might be considered a &#8216;normal&#8217; orgasm, an orgasm from a single man with a single cock in her vagina.&nbsp; 

Mostly she still just took cocks in the mouth and ass.&nbsp; But increasingly Brad let her finger herself to orgasm while being butt fucked, or let Faye and other women--Rose, the black haired beauty Brad had fucked beside her had returned several evenings with two or three girl friends to play with her and have her serve them--lick or fist fuck her until she came.&nbsp; Faye sometimes made her come by fucking her pussy with the strap on or, rarely, after making her douche, by going down on her.&nbsp; She got to use ever bigger dildos to get herself off, sometimes just the dildo, sometimes the dildo in her cunt while a cock was up her ass.&nbsp; She was now taking one nearly as thick as an arm.

She was permitted to come while sandwiched between two men, or with cocks in all three holes.

Ooni often made her come while torturing her, further blurring pain and pleasure.

And she was compelled to come while engaging in other bizarre acts.

It didn&#8217;t matter.&nbsp; She got to come.&nbsp; And that didn&#8217;t really even matter either.&nbsp; She liked to come.&nbsp; She craved to come.&nbsp; And the craving was really all.&nbsp; The constant tension, the constant anticipation, heightened sensibility, heightened sensitivity, nerve ends always activated.&nbsp; Life lived on a whole new level of intensity.&nbsp; The rush of constantly desiring and being desired.

I&#8217;ve become a bitch constantly in heat, Carol Edwards realized, and did not want to be anything else.

Subject:&nbsp; a few things you still don&#8217;t know
Attachment:&nbsp; carolhomemovie5.mp4

In his office Ross Edwards opened the video and turned the volume down to the lowest level which he could hear.&nbsp; 

A darkened screen.&nbsp; Carol&#8217;s voice.

�Please don&#8217;t do this.&nbsp; He doesn&#8217;t need to see this.�

From black the screen faded in to the spacious master bathroom of the San Diego condo.&nbsp; Terra cotta tile floor.&nbsp; An oversize tub with Jacuzzi nozzles.&nbsp; A corner shower with clear glass walls.&nbsp; Double basins.&nbsp; Toilet.&nbsp; A woman who could only be Carol on her knees, fully dressed, as though she had just come home from work.&nbsp; Ross did not recognize the dress and could not see the woman&#8217;s face because her head was in the toilet.&nbsp; Seat raised.&nbsp; All the way in.

�Drink.�

Indistinguishable sound.

The camera was hand held and wavered.&nbsp; A man&#8217;s left hand and arm entered the screen, moved as Ross knew it would to the flush lever.&nbsp; Water gushed into the bowl.&nbsp; The woman did not move.&nbsp; Hand grabbed a fistful of hair, lifted, turned Carol&#8217;s dripping, eyes-closed face toward the camera.&nbsp; Pushed it back down.

Brad&#8217;s voice:&nbsp; �Wash.&nbsp; Rinse.&nbsp; Repeat.�&nbsp; 

The toilet flushed again.

Fade to black.



Fade in to Carol, face still wet, shoulders and bodice of dress damp, still fully dressed, which somehow made it worse, kneeling in the bathtub.

�Open.�

Her mouth opened.

�Wider.�

Nothing happened for almost a minute before a yellow stream arched onto the screen and into Carol&#8217;s mouth.

Brad chuckled.&nbsp; �Always takes me a while when I have a hard-on.
Had to tie her up and use a ring gag at first.&nbsp; But after three or four times she got used to it.&nbsp; Swallow.�

Ross saw movement in his wife&#8217; throat.

Her eyes squeezed closed as the stream moved up to her forehead, down painting her cheeks, to her lips which obediently opened again, then lower, soaking her dress until her nipples became visible through the cloth.

Fade to black.

Fade in to a close up of Carol&#8217;s contorted face.&nbsp; Wet sounds.&nbsp; Heavy breathing.&nbsp; Grunts.

Slowly the camera zoomed back to reveal her naked in the middle of their bed.&nbsp; She was on her back, her legs spread, knees pulled beside her breasts,&nbsp; feet in the air, her right hand buried to the wrist in her cunt, fist-fucking herself.

�You can come,� said Brad.

Sounds of her doing so as the screen faded to black.

An unholy scream that made Ross glad he had turned the volume down.

The screen remained black.

�No.&nbsp; Oh, god.&nbsp; No.&nbsp; I can&#8217;t stand it.&nbsp; It is too much.&nbsp; Please.&nbsp; Please let me down.� 

The screen faded in to an image Ross Edwards had never even imagined.

Carol was hanging naked in a room Ross did not recognize. Her feet were two feet from a hardwood floor.&nbsp; Her arms were tied behind her.&nbsp;&nbsp; Wrist to wrist.&nbsp; Elbow tight to elbow.&nbsp; Thrusting her breasts out, which wasn&#8217;t necessary.&nbsp; They would have been out anyway because she was hanging by them.&nbsp; A rope ran about both, distending them to the point it seemed they would be torn off, and then up to the ceiling.

A naked bony man appeared, with a disproportionately healthy erection jutting from his corpse-like pelvis and with, unbelievably, drum sticks in his hands.&nbsp; Reaching above his head he began beating Carol&#8217;s blood black nipples like a snare drum, causing her screams to reach new crescendos.

Fade to black.

Fade in to Carol on the floor.&nbsp; The camera moved slowly over her body, lingering on sobbing face and rope marks cut deep into the base of her still purple breasts. 

Fade to black.

The screen remained black.&nbsp; �No.&nbsp; Please.&nbsp; No more.&nbsp; Ahgggg!�

Abrupt silence.

The file ended.


Ross sat at his desk, unable to move, stupefied, almost unable to breath.

He gradually came back to his senses and a moment of guilt when he realized his cock was rock hard.&nbsp; But only a moment.&nbsp; He could hardly wait to get home.

�Carol, could you come to my office?�&nbsp; 

The voice was Rik Cronin&#8217;s.&nbsp; 

Most of the staff worked in an open space of the old warehouse, divided into cubicles by shoulder high partitions; but Rik Cronin of course had his own office, as did five of the senior architects, including Carol Edwards.&nbsp; Rik&#8217;s was only a few steps away from her&#8217;s, on the other side of an area shared by his secretary and three PA&#8217;s for the senior architects.

Distracted, she gave a courtesy knock on his door and entered.&nbsp; She had just seen an email that Ross had sent ten hours earlier, declaring that he was going to file for divorce.&nbsp; Though hardly unexpected, it had an effect.

Giving Rik a forced smile, she said, �Good morning.�

She hadn&#8217;t noticed anyone else in the room.&nbsp; 

Her heart sank.&nbsp; Instantly she foresaw everything.&nbsp; Knew that her life had undergone another seismic shift.&nbsp; That she had just lost her final refuge.&nbsp; A familiar voice to her left said, �I don&#8217;t believe you are properly dressed to be in my presence.�

Carol Edwards turned and saw Brad Tomalin, sitting, smiling, legs casually crossed in one of the chairs around a conference table on the far side of the room.&nbsp; She seemed to have lost her voice; but then there was nothing to say.

�I see what appear to be pantyhose, and I suspect a bra and panties.�

�I...I had no way of knowing you were here.�

�Of course not.&nbsp; But a good executive is always prepared.&nbsp; No reason to waste all that time pulling them on and off every time I send for you.&nbsp; Rik won&#8217;t mind if we extend the rule to this office as well, will you, Rik?�
�Indeed not.�

Both men smiled.&nbsp; Brad Tomalin easily.&nbsp; Rik Cronin tensely.

�So...� said Brad.

�So?� Carol hated that her voice wavered.

�We&#8217;re waiting.�

Carol started to speak.&nbsp; Stopped.&nbsp; A hundred thoughts ran through her mind and cancelled one another out before reaching the inevitable conclusion.

�All of it?� she finally asked.

Brad nodded.

Standing midway between the two men, she looked at neither, staring at the blank cream colored painted brick wall in front of her as she unbuttoned her blouse and let it fall to the carpeted floor.&nbsp; 

To her right Rik Cronin&#8217;s breath became louder as she continued to reveal what was familiar to Brad Tomalin, but which he had so long desired, never seen, and would soon possess.

�Beautiful isn&#8217;t she?�

�Yes.&nbsp; More even than I had imagined.�

�Over here,� Brad ordered.

Carol walked to him, aware of Rik&#8217;s eyes boring into her back.

�Take it out and get it wet.�

She got down on her knees for the first time in that office, unzipped his suit pants, bent to the task.

After a few minutes, �That&#8217;s enough.&nbsp; Climb on.&nbsp; No, face Rik.�

�Where?�

�In the ass.&nbsp; Don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m going to reward you for being improperly dressed, do you?�

Placed her bare feet and legs outside his clothed ones, she lowered herself onto his cock and began riding.

�Look at Rik.&nbsp; Make eye contact.�

She did and saw a face of fearsome lust.

�Lean back against my chest.&nbsp; Raise you feet to my knees so he can see more clearly what he is getting.�

Rik placed his hands on her hips and raised them so he could thrust up.&nbsp; Carol threw her head back and groaned.

�Spread open your cunt.&nbsp; Let him see what he&#8217;s not getting.�

Air was forced from her lungs on each inward stroke.&nbsp;&nbsp; The interior office wall was not thick.&nbsp; She feared that the sounds were carrying into the reception area.

�Ahhh.�&nbsp; She felt him come.

Strong hands lifted her.

�Clean it.�&nbsp;&nbsp; Then as she knelt and did, to Rik,&nbsp; �Woman will definitely cause an increase in your dry cleaning bills.�

�I can...It will be worth it.�

Brad laughed, �I&#8217;m sure it will be.�&nbsp; He stood, zipped, and walked to the door, which he opened.&nbsp;&nbsp; Carol Edwards cringed and hoped no one outside could see.&nbsp; �Enjoy.�

Following the Equator.&nbsp; 

Mark Twain didn&#8217;t in the book he wrote with that title more than a century ago.&nbsp; In fact he spent almost no time at all on the Equator except briefly when crossing it four times.

The Equator is father south than most people think.&nbsp; Not geographically, but relatively.

Start at Greenwich, England, O� Longitude, and follow the Equator east. 

Your first landfall will be far down the African continent near Libreville, Gabon.&nbsp;&nbsp; Cross the Congo.&nbsp; Pass just north of Nairobi and Kilimanjaro--�Snow capped mountains on the Equator!&nbsp; Impossible!� scoffed 19th Century skeptics.&nbsp; Over the Indian Ocean you will barely notice the atolls of the Maldives, and with continued global warning, soon you won&#8217;t notice them at all.&nbsp; Beyond the mountain jungles of Sumatra, you will pass just south of Singapore.&nbsp; On to Borneo.&nbsp; Celebes.&nbsp; Hundreds of smaller Indonesian islands.&nbsp; The Pacific will seem as empty as the Indian Ocean, and much, much bigger.&nbsp; Don&#8217;t blink or you will miss Tarawa, where Japanese and Americans slaughtered each other for a while before uniting in the common interests of baseball and consumerism.&nbsp;&nbsp; Not long before you reach the Galapagos, of tortoise and Darwinian finch fame, you will be two thousand miles south of San Diego, California.&nbsp; Another continental landfall at Quito, Ecuador.&nbsp; Northern Brazil.&nbsp; The mouth of the Amazon.&nbsp; And back out over the South Atlantic where you began.

Almost all the world&#8217;s landmass, people, and troubles--which is perhaps redundant--are found north of that convenient, but imaginary line.&nbsp; As are Brad Tomalin, and Carol Edwards, and Ross Edwards.&nbsp;&nbsp; A triangle, not of love, but linked by other powerful imaginary lines.

�

Ross Edwards was becoming a regular at the shop on Upper Bukit Timah Road.&nbsp; The clerk, always the same slight Chinese middle aged man, neatly dressed in an open collared white dress shirt and dark slacks, now gave him the smile of recognition for a valued customer.&nbsp; 

Ross had hoped that making the decision to divorce Carol, even if he couldn&#8217;t act on it until he found time to return to California, would free him.&nbsp; No longer would it be his woman who was doing Brad Tomalin&#8217;s bidding.&nbsp; But it hadn&#8217;t.

The emails, the answering messages, the images, the videos, all continued.&nbsp; He could, of course, close those accounts or block Brad Tomalin as a sender.&nbsp; Or he could just delete unread and erase unheard.&nbsp; But he couldn&#8217;t.

Today&#8217;s embarrassing purchases were the result of the combined influences of an email that morning in which Brad told him of inserting a butt plug in Carol at lunch which she wore until he removed it at the condo that night, including all afternoon in her office, and an earlier image.

The clerk wrapped the items carefully, smiled politely, handed the parcel to Ross Edwards, and gave a slight bow.&nbsp; 

When Ross got home, he found the clerk had also included a guest pass to a place called, The Kricket Klub.&nbsp; Ross recognized the address as being in one of Singapore&#8217;s few remaining old quarters, yet to be redeveloped into high rises. 

Somehow he doubted that the Klub had anything to do with the English game, though there might be a &#8216;silly mid-off&#8217;&nbsp; and more than a few &#8216;stumps.&#8217;

�

Ross Edwards squirmed uncomfortably in his chair.&nbsp; He needed for this meeting to be over.&nbsp; Desperately.&nbsp; He was too full and he itched. Finally it was, and with great relief he stood and returned to his office, hoping he was walking normally.

Traffic that evening was interminable, and as soon as he reached his apartment, he turned on several lights, walked to the over size&nbsp; windows, on which he too now left the curtain permanently pulled to one side, and stripped off his clothes.&nbsp; Calvin Kleins down, black tail fell from where he had wrapped it around his waist.&nbsp; Except that his sprouted from a black plug rather than red, it was identical to the one Carol sometimes wore.&nbsp; Ross had discovered that the two foot long strands of &#8216;hair&#8217; were plastic.&nbsp; Conveniently washable.&nbsp; 

He had intended to remove the plug as soon as he got home, but walked into the bedroom and turned, looking over his shoulder in the full length mirror.&nbsp; Carol looked sexy; he looked ridiculous.&nbsp; &#8216;I am ridiculous,&#8217; he thought.&nbsp; &#8216;If I&#8217;m going to be a jackass, I might as well wear the tail.&#8217;

The tail swished against the backs of his thighs as he went into the den.&nbsp; His cock swayed side to side.&nbsp; Fluid had been oozing from it all day.&nbsp; Although he deliberately hadn&#8217;t masturbated at the office, he&#8217;d had repeatedly to unzip and wipe with a tissue.&nbsp; 

Bending to unlock the lower drawer in his desk--this had been the day for his cleaning lady--caused the plug to press harder against his prostate.&nbsp; He removed yesterday&#8217;s other purchase, a black leather penis gag.&nbsp; Beside it was the Kricket Klub card.&nbsp; &#8216;I am not going there,&#8217; Ross Edwards told himself.&nbsp; Yet he kept the card.

Placing the plastic penis in his mouth and tightening the buckle at the back of his head, he returning to the living room, took his MacBook Air and lay down on the couch.&nbsp; His tongue sought a comfortable position around the intruding plastic.&nbsp; Carol took cocks in the mouth and the ass.&nbsp; This must be what it feels like, he thought.&nbsp; But was it really?&nbsp; He could find out at the Kricket Klub.

Deliberately he broke that off and opened his MacBook Air.&nbsp; He was disappointed to find no new emails.&nbsp; 

He pressed the &#8216;play messages&#8217; button on his answering machine and when he got over his initial surprise reached down and began to stroke his seeping cock.

�Hello, Ross.&nbsp;&nbsp; Rik Cronin in case you don&#8217;t recognize the voice.&nbsp; It has been a while.

Your lovely wife is here, too.&nbsp; Brad wants you to know that I&#8217;m using her.&nbsp; Probably more than anyone else these days.&nbsp; And that&#8217;s saying something.&nbsp; Prerogative of convenient access.&nbsp; Two or three times most weekdays.&nbsp;&nbsp; I&#8217;ve always liked my work, but never looked forward to getting to the office this much.

I&#8217;m in a somewhat graceless but extremely pleasurable position at the moment.&nbsp; Naked from the waist down, shirt and tie above.&nbsp; My feet are on my desk and Carol is under it.&nbsp; Completely naked.&nbsp; Licking my ass.&nbsp; Rimming and probing.&nbsp; The beautiful stand-offish Mrs. Edwards, the office brown nose.&nbsp; A dream come true.&nbsp; I must be being rewarded for the good I did in a previous life.

Brad specifically wants you to know that she&#8217;s down there precisely at&nbsp; 9:00 a.m. Monday through Friday.&nbsp; Not licking my ass.&nbsp; Sucking my dick.&nbsp; It&#8217;s become an office ritual.&nbsp; Everyone knows.&nbsp; Just before 9, Mrs. Edwards enters my office, without knocking.&nbsp; Lipstick pristine.&nbsp; And fifteen or so minutes later, she leaves, lipstick smeared.&nbsp; I could let her use my bathroom, but don&#8217;t.&nbsp; At least not for that, though we do go in there sometimes.

I know that I&#8217;m not the first one she does every morning, but I love that when she applies that lipstick in your condo, she knows that in an hour it will be rubbing off on my cock.

Don&#8217;t know when 9 a.m. here is your time.

When it that in Singapore, Carol?

Midnight, she says.&nbsp; 

That&#8217;s all right.&nbsp; My balls now.

I usually have her again later in the morning or a couple of times in the afternoon.&nbsp; Have to get some work done, you know.&nbsp; Though Carol is, perhaps understandably, falling behind a bit.&nbsp; Her boss doesn&#8217;t seem to mind.

Those vary--the later times.&nbsp; Sometimes her mouth; sometimes her ass.&nbsp; Sometimes my office; sometimes hers.&nbsp; Sometimes I have her strip completely naked again; sometimes I just pull up her skirt.&nbsp; No underwear permitted here either.&nbsp; Sometimes I have her leave only her shoes on.&nbsp; Sometimes I have her come in here and strip and just sit around naked until I&#8217;m ready.&nbsp; Or kneel.&nbsp; Got a chair across from my desk that she looks great in with a leg over each arm.&nbsp; Trouble is that I can&#8217;t glance up too frequently&nbsp; at that glistening wet slit without getting on with it. 

That first one at 9 a.m., though, she is always completely naked.&nbsp; Comes in.&nbsp; Strips.&nbsp; Crawls under my desk and starts sucking.

Funny you always want what you can&#8217;t have.&nbsp; Most women you have a hassle getting deep throat or them taking it up the ass.&nbsp; With Carol I can&#8217;t have her cunt and so I find myself really wanting a normal fuck.&nbsp; Ah, well.&nbsp; 

Bought a new wall mirror for my office, so I can see both sides now.&nbsp; Wasn&#8217;t that a song?&nbsp; You wife does look great on her knees.&nbsp; Back too for that matter.&nbsp; But I think knees best.&nbsp; Though I certainly couldn&#8217;t choose between the way she is now with my balls in her mouth--move on up to my cock--or with my cock up her ass.&nbsp; There is being on your knees and there is being on your knees.&nbsp; All good.&nbsp; You know how great it is to have a couple of hot wet holes to dump a load in whenever you want.&nbsp; Sorry, forgot that you don&#8217;t know.&nbsp; At least not any longer Carol&#8217;s holes.&nbsp; 

I like dropping into her office and sticking my cock in her mouth while she&#8217;s sitting at her desk, or having her stand and bend over the desk, lift her skirt and stick it up her ass.&nbsp; Sometimes I just take a few strokes, have her lick it clean, and leave.&nbsp; Of course she never knows how far I&#8217;m going to go when I start.&nbsp; 

And of course she hates that its me.&nbsp; And I love that she hates it.&nbsp; But I&#8217;m beginning to suspect that she&#8217;s so kinked that she loves hating it.&nbsp; If you follow.

Despite that--or because of it--she tries so hard to please.&nbsp; 

Or I reach down and play with her tits. Squeeze those big dark nipples through her dress or blouse.&nbsp; I trust you recall how that turns her on.&nbsp; Hypersensitive nipples.&nbsp; Told me once that she feels they are wired directly to her clit.&nbsp; Get her panting.&nbsp; Then leave.

That&#8217;s it.&nbsp;&nbsp; All the way down.

She is good, Ross.&nbsp; Quite the little woman.&nbsp; You&#8217;re a lucky man.&nbsp; Or not.

You know the thing--opps.&nbsp; Going to have...to excuse me.&nbsp; Getting close to coming.

The thing--ohh, that is good.&nbsp; 

The thing is not her beauty.&nbsp;&nbsp; Though I must admit that she looks...even...better naked that I imagined.&nbsp; And I imagined a lot. And---ohh, shit.&nbsp; Hold there.&nbsp; Ohh.&nbsp;&nbsp; Ohh.

Whew.&nbsp; Woman going to be the death of me.&nbsp; Be worth it.

That&#8217;s it.&nbsp; Get it all.&nbsp; Missed a drop.&nbsp; There.

What was I saying?

Oh, yes.&nbsp; Beauty.&nbsp; Woman has the best body I&#8217;ve ever seen.&nbsp; But the thing is that she is also the biggest slut I&#8217;ve ever known.&nbsp; Does things that would make a Tijuana whore blush.&nbsp; And I&#8217;ve gone across the border often enough to know.&nbsp; Looks so innocent.&nbsp; A female Dorian Gray.&nbsp; The lower she sinks, the purer she appears.&nbsp; 

Licks come off the desk, off the floor, out of the toilet--but Brad says you already know that.&nbsp;&nbsp; Gives the best head I&#8217;ve ever had.&nbsp; Hardly ever gags.&nbsp; I can sit back and let her do all the work or make her squat&nbsp; with her back against a wall so she can&#8217;t move away and skull fuck her.&nbsp; Takes it as hard as you want up the ass.&nbsp; Love pounding her and seeing those big tits sway.&nbsp; You must remember what that&#8217;s like.&nbsp; Though I hear you didn&#8217;t use her ass much.&nbsp; If you ever get the chance, you&#8217;ll find it&#8217;s still tight.&nbsp; I can still make her squeal though.&nbsp; Enjoy that.&nbsp; She&#8217;s always embarrassed leaving the office after that happens.&nbsp; 

Well, got to go.&nbsp; I think I&#8217;ll have time to do her ass later.&nbsp; Might sit back and let her fuck her own ass.&nbsp; Looks great with her facing my feet, crouching, my cock disappearing between those beautiful rising and lowering cheeks.&nbsp; Slap them to control the rhythm.&nbsp; Slut takes direction perfectly.

Man, I&#8217;m getting turned on again.&nbsp; 

We all owe you a debt of gratitude for going to Singapore, Ross.&nbsp; Great move.


�

Ross Edwards scrambled to his feet and, choking on the penis gag, stumbled to the living room window.&nbsp; Reaching back with one hand, he grabbed the base of his tail, ripped out the butt plug, jammed it painfully back in, while he pulled on his cock with his other hand until a jet of come soared out.

On shaking legs, he watched it ooze slowly down the glass.&nbsp; 

A line of headlines passing far below.&nbsp; LIghts on in an identical building across the street.&nbsp; He could see into apartments.&nbsp; A couple in the flickering blue light of a television.&nbsp; A woman ironing.&nbsp; A family sitting around the dinner table.&nbsp; He could see them.&nbsp; They, if they bothered, could see him.

People who live in glass houses shouldn&#8217;t wag their tails.&nbsp; But, in a gesture of derisive defiance, Ross Edwards turned and waged his anyway.


22


After they left her, even though it was almost midnight,&nbsp; she pulled a long white cotton beach dress over her head and went barefoot down to her car, a yellow VW Beetle convertible.&nbsp; In the adjoining space was their other car, a Land Rover that Ross wanted for some reason, although he only ever drove it on freeways and city streets.

With the top up, she drove down the hill to Mission Beach,&nbsp; a narrow two mile long sand bar of densely packed beach houses, where she was lucky enough to find a parking space.&nbsp; 

She swung herself easily over the waist high sea wall, and crossed twenty yards of&nbsp; soft sand, cool on the soles of her feet, to continent&#8217;s edge.

Water and sky were black and the horizon where they met indistinguishable.&nbsp; Sky filled with stars.&nbsp; Water broken by five or six constantly changing pale lines of surf, the most distant where 5&#8217; waves first broke, the closest only an inch or two high where sea lapped at sand.

She was standing on wave-washed sand that was smooth and hard.&nbsp; Cool water dashed up and over her feet.&nbsp; In the darkness, illuminated only by lights on the other side of the sea wall, and beneath swirling water, the coral pink polish on her toenails appeared black.&nbsp; Her mouth and throat were coated with come.&nbsp; She could still taste it.&nbsp; Wavelet receded; another approached.&nbsp; She reached down and scooped up a handful of salt water and brought it to her mouth.&nbsp; Rinsed.&nbsp; Spat out.&nbsp; Come was trickling down her thighs.&nbsp; She raised the hem of her dress and brought another handful of water up between her legs.&nbsp; Then a second, before dropping her dress again.&nbsp; Salt burned raw flesh.

For several more minutes she stood there, watching pale lines, listening to the surf, before turning and walking north toward the lights on the hill at La Jolla, wavelets playing over her bare feet and ankles.

The beach was mostly deserted, but at one of the concrete rings provided at intervals for that purpose,&nbsp; a dozen or so people were sitting around a bonfire.&nbsp; Someone was playing a guitar, and others were singing.

A woman&#8217;s voice called to her, �Come.&nbsp; Join us.�

Carol Edwards waved, smiled &#8216;no&#8217;, and walked on in darkness.



23

�You do it this time.�

�No.&nbsp; Please.&nbsp; I can&#8217;t�

�If you do, I&#8217;ll let you come.&nbsp; If you make me do it, it won&#8217;t be just one needle through your nipples, but several, and maybe one in your clit as well.&nbsp; And you won&#8217;t get to come.�

�I can&#8217;t.&nbsp; I really can&#8217;t do that to myself.�

�Of course you can.&nbsp; Just take your right nipple between the thumb and forefinger of your left hand.&nbsp; Go ahead.&nbsp; Do it.&nbsp; Now stretch it out.&nbsp; Good.&nbsp; Take one of the needles in your right hand.&nbsp; Do it, damn it!� 

A hand slapped bare flesh.

�Ohh.&nbsp; No.&nbsp; Don&#8217;t.&nbsp; I&#8217;ll do it.�

�That&#8217;s better.&nbsp; Stretch the nipple out again.&nbsp; End of the needle right there.&nbsp; Press down.&nbsp; You know how sharp those needles are.&nbsp; It will go right through.&nbsp; Hardly hurt.&nbsp; A pinprick.&nbsp; Literally.�

�I can&#8217;t.&nbsp; I just can&#8217;t.�

�I&#8217;m going to tell you for the last time.&nbsp; If I do it, it will hurt.&nbsp; Serious pain.&nbsp; Not just needles through each nipple, but at least one driven right in, buried.&nbsp; Think about an orgasm.&nbsp; When did you last have one?�

�L..last week.�

�You must need relief.&nbsp; DO IT!�

�Aghh.�

�There.&nbsp; That wasn&#8217;t so bad, was it?&nbsp; Only a drop of blood.&nbsp; Now the other.&nbsp; Stretch it out.&nbsp; Make it quick before you have time to think.�

�Ohh.�

�Good.&nbsp; Good slut.&nbsp; I like the look.&nbsp; Not as much as steel or gold rings, but Brad won&#8217;t let me permanently pierce you.&nbsp; Yet.

�Now let me loop these weights over them, and you can suck me off, and then I&#8217;ll let you come.&nbsp; You can even choose:&nbsp; my fist, the big dildo, your own fingers.&nbsp; Or maybe you&#8217;d like to get off rubbing your clit against the toe of my boot?&nbsp; You seemed to enjoy that.&nbsp; Which will it be?� 

�Your fist.&nbsp; Oow, that hurts.�

�Start sucking.&nbsp; The sooner I come, the sooner you will.&nbsp; And then I&#8217;ll remove the weights and you can remove the needles.�

�Not now, Felicia.�

Felicia Sines, nineteen year old California surfer girl and sometimes girl friend of Brad Tomalin&#8217;s younger son, Tim, stopped nibbling the instep of Brad Tomalin&#8217;s left foot, and asked, �When?�

�Soon.&nbsp; Go below and top up our margaritas.�

Felicia stood up on the teak foredeck of SAUDADE, Brad&#8217;s 50&#8217; Baglietto, revealing her perfect tan and body.&nbsp; She was wearing a thin gold chain around one finely turned ankle and a gold thong not much bigger around her finely turned hips, and a smile.&nbsp; Felicia was a cheerful girl.&nbsp; She did not mind being shared by father and son.&nbsp; Tim was studying film at USC and not around that much during the school year, and for that matter the old man was the better lay, stronger, more inventive, deliciously deviant.&nbsp; Felicia liked learning new things.&nbsp; She also liked the toys and the abundant money and even Brad&#8217;s hairy chest and back.&nbsp; It was like having sex with a gorilla.&nbsp; Which was an intriguing idea.&nbsp; She did not know that Brad had let Tim, and his friends, use Carol Edwards on several occasions, and wouldn&#8217;t have cared anyway.

As she made her pretty way aft and below to the galley, Brad Tomalin&#8217;s eyes followed her and then moved across sparkling water to the crest of Point Loma to the east.&nbsp; 

The SAUDADE was anchored in a small sculpted cove off South Mission Beach.&nbsp; He kept the boat at a Shelter Island yacht club in San Diego Bay and had brought her and Felicia around that morning.

Although he could afford a bigger yacht, and did employ a professional captain to maintain her and move her along the coast, down to Mexico in the winter and back in the spring, he liked to operate the boat himself.&nbsp; Self-reliance, energy, and trusting no one were the pillars, if not secrets, of his success.

In the distance Brad could see Carol Edward&#8217;s building, but not her unit, which was on the other side, facing east.&nbsp; A week ago she had told him of Ross&#8217;s intention to divorce.

He assumed she was home.&nbsp; If she was, she was alone.&nbsp; He had told everyone to leave her alone that Saturday.&nbsp; After her dawn rounds, she hadn&#8217;t been used Friday either.&nbsp; Rik Cronin was out of town and he, Brad, hadn&#8217;t called her to his office for several days.&nbsp; In truth he was getting a trifle bored with this experiment and was considering ending it.&nbsp; He thought he knew how.&nbsp; Today would break the routine, disorient her a bit.&nbsp;&nbsp; 

Thoughts of Carol Edwards vanished as Felicia returned with chilled glasses.&nbsp; Although that night as he enjoyed the sensation of nineteen year old breasts massaging his back, he glanced at the clock on the bulkhead and saw that it was 8:47, and pictured Carol Edwards kneeling naked a mile away, waiting in vain for a door to open.

...
&nbsp; 
Sunday afternoon Carol was sitting on the sofa in her living room half-watching tennis.&nbsp; 

Sharapova was playing Henin and, of course, every time she hit the ball she grunted.&nbsp; Carol was edgy.&nbsp; People slept in on weekends, so she had no morning rounds on Saturday or Sunday and she had now not had sex for more than forty-eight hours.&nbsp; No one had come through the unlocked door.&nbsp; No one had called.&nbsp;&nbsp; 

She had not slept well last night, tossing, turning, wide awake at every slight sound, listening for someone else in the bedroom.&nbsp; But there never was.&nbsp; 

A long rally.&nbsp; Sharapova&#8217;s grunts came at regular intervals.&nbsp; Just as I grunt, thought Carol, when they fuck me.&nbsp; 

Henin won the point.&nbsp; The telephone rang.&nbsp; Carol started.

�Hello?�

�It&#8217;s me.&nbsp; Ravi if you don&#8217;t recognize.&nbsp; Put on some fresh lipstick and come down and wrap them around my cock.�&nbsp; 

Carol turned off the TV and hurried back to the master bathroom, where she applied lipstick, ran a comb through her hair, more blond than brown now from both sun and artifice because Brad liked it better than way.&nbsp; She was wearing a denim skirt and a green tank top.&nbsp; She never bothered with underwear even at home any more. Slipping into a pair of low heeled sandals, she headed down stairs.

Outside Ravi&#8217;s door she hesitated, before raising the elephant headed door knocker.

�Come on it, it&#8217;s not locked.�

I&#8217;ve caused this whole building to be a burglar&#8217;s dream, she thought, and turned the handle to be confronted not just by Ravi as she had expected, but by Ravi and friends.&nbsp; Five of them.&nbsp; Collective nouns came to her mind.&nbsp; A shrewdness of apes.&nbsp; A conspiracy of ravens.&nbsp; A sneak of weasels.&nbsp; This would be a code of geeks.

�What&#8217;s this?�&nbsp; 

�Close the door.&nbsp; Brad knows.�

She did as she was told, but took only a single step into the tense room.&nbsp; Ravi was grinning, but the other five were wound tight.

�A few of my friends.&nbsp; They didn&#8217;t believe when I told them about you, so Brad said I could show them.&nbsp; Come closer.�

She took a few more tentative steps.

The five other men--boys in her mind--were in their twenties or at most early thirties--and clearly uneasy.&nbsp;&nbsp; All wore baggy shorts and t-shirts, and were shorter than she.&nbsp; Two were on the sofa with Ravi in the middle.&nbsp; Two others in chairs opposite, and one in a chair shifted from the dining room table.&nbsp; Carol noted that the coffee table had been moved against a wall, clearing the center of the room.
She stood, under avid inspection, waiting for the usual litany.&nbsp; It came.

�Beautiful, isn&#8217;t she?�&nbsp; 

Response from the congregation of muttered agreement.

Her clothes didn&#8217;t conceal much.&nbsp; Long legs were bare to mid-thigh.&nbsp; Tanned shoulders.&nbsp; Vulnerable throat.&nbsp; Tank top molded to breasts.

�But even better naked.&nbsp; Show them.�

Gasps as Carol pulled the tank top up, dropped it on the floor, remembering Brad&#8217;s &#8216;rumbled is sexy&#8217;, pushed her skirt down, stepped out of her shoes.

Without being told, she did a slow twirl.

�What are those marks on your back?�

Facing the boys again, she made eye contact with the one who had spoken.&nbsp; �Some of the people I&#8217;m given to torture me.�

�And you let them?�&nbsp; asked another.

�Obviously.�

�How?� and �Why?� came simultaneously.

Ignoring the &#8216;why&#8217; for the moment, she shrugged a shoulder in reference to her back.&nbsp; �It depends.&nbsp; On the person and the situation.&nbsp; Sometimes it&#8217;s fast and brutal.&nbsp; Sometimes leisurely and prolonged.&nbsp; I prefer fast.&nbsp; Leisurely really is torture.&nbsp; They beat me.&nbsp; Twist.&nbsp; Pinch.&nbsp; Clips.&nbsp; Tie me in impossible positions.&nbsp; Sometimes that&#8217;s all.&nbsp; Just tie me in ways that don&#8217;t hurt much in the beginning, but become unbearable when the strain is prolonged, like hanging upside down by one foot.&nbsp; Needles. Candles.&nbsp; Electricity.&nbsp; Water.&nbsp; They are very inventive.�

�Water?�

�One man has a swimming pool.&nbsp; Ties my hands and feet.&nbsp; Holds me under until I almost drown.�

�What&#8217;s the worst?�

�Drowning is bad.&nbsp; Panic.&nbsp; But the stun gun, or cattle prod, or whatever it is, is worse.&nbsp; Much worse.&nbsp; And being suspended by my breasts.�

�Saw that picture.&nbsp; Couldn&#8217;t believe it.�

�Why do you let them do these terrible things?�

�It&#8217;s all sex, isn&#8217;t it?&nbsp; And I don&#8217;t have to make any decisions.&nbsp; I like that men--and women--desire me.&nbsp; That there are always people thinking about me, remembering what I felt and looked like.&nbsp; Wanting me.�&nbsp; She laughed, not unkindly.&nbsp; �The way all of you want me now.�

�Talked enough,� broke in Ravi impatiently.&nbsp; �Crawl over here.�&nbsp; And as Carol Edwards did, his grin broadened until it almost spit his thin face and he said to the others, �See.�&nbsp; 

�Take it out.�

He raised his hips so she could pull down his shorts.&nbsp; His was not wearing underpants, clean or otherwise.&nbsp; Dusky cock flopped out to exclamations of admiration.&nbsp; �You are hung, man.�&nbsp; �No idea.�&nbsp; �Why should you have any idea, you faggot?&nbsp; Maybe you want to suck it instead of her?�

Carol Edwards&#8217; pink tongue started at Ravi&#8217;s scrotum and traced a glistening path up to the wet tip of his cock.&nbsp; Before she wrapped her lips around it, she looked up and asked, �Are you all doing me?�

�Just me.&nbsp; Today.&nbsp; They haven&#8217;t been approved.&nbsp; Now suck.�

Blond head bobbed.&nbsp;&nbsp; The slight Indian leaned back, glanced self-satisfied around at his mostly envious friends.&nbsp; After a while he reached out and put his hands on the back of the blond head and forced it down.&nbsp; Gagging.&nbsp; And held it there.&nbsp; 

�Never been deep throated,� said an onlooker.

Releasing a gasping Carol, Ravi said, �And you won&#8217;t be today.&nbsp; Though I may let you touch.

�Crawl over and show them how you are every evening at 8:30.

�Just like that.&nbsp; She kneels there waiting.&nbsp; Maybe one night we&#8217;ll all come through the door.�

�Would you like that?�

�Yes.�

�You&#8217;d like to do all of us?�

�Why not?� Carol Edwards asked, her face pressed against hardwood.&nbsp; �A cock&#8217;s a cock.&nbsp; And I like cocks.&nbsp; And I&#8217;ve done more.�

�We saw the photos.&nbsp; How many?�

�I don&#8217;t know.�

�You don&#8217;t look like a slut.�

�So I&#8217;m told.�

�Here,� said Ravi, tossing a large butt plug that bounced off her back.&nbsp; �Open it up for us.�

Carol raised her head and reached out for the plug that had fallen a few feet away, brought it to her mouth and sucked it in.&nbsp; After two days of abstinence, she would give them a show.&nbsp; Swallowed the flesh colored silicone to the base.&nbsp; Slowly withdrew.&nbsp; Swallowed again.&nbsp; Withdrew.&nbsp; Spit on the tip.&nbsp; Lowered her head, reached back with one hand and spread her cheeks, while with the other pressed the plug into her anus.&nbsp; Tantalizingly slowly.&nbsp; Muscle stretching, distending, closing as the widest part passed.&nbsp; Equally slowly out.&nbsp; 

�Jesus.�

�I&#8217;m going to come in my pants.�

�Leave it in and crawl around and lick everyone&#8217;s feet.�

The first boy was wearing trainers.&nbsp; Both he and Carol looked at Ravi questioningly.&nbsp; �Shoes will do.�

Providing interesting views from all angles, she worked her way around the half circle.&nbsp; Three of the boys, she noticed, seemed more shocked than aroused.

�Stand up.&nbsp; Go around and show them your ass.&nbsp; You guys can touch her.&nbsp; Kiss her if you want, but I seldom do because of where that mouth has probably been.&nbsp; Fuck her with the plug.&nbsp; But don&#8217;t touch her cunt.�

She turned and presented her ass, as she had that first long ago day in Brad&#8217;s office--though it really wasn&#8217;t that long.&nbsp; She tried to remember.&nbsp; So much had happened.&nbsp; Pain as the plug was pulled out and shoved back in.&nbsp; 

�You like it in the ass?�

�Yes. Now I do.�

�You didn&#8217;t?�

She moved to the next boy.

�No.�

�What changed?�

�Me.�

�Turn around.�

Hands reached out and squeezed her breasts, teased her nipples.

When she got to Ravi, he smirked, �Take it out and climb on.�

She crawled onto his lap, facing him.&nbsp; 

�Put it in.�

From an onlooker, �Too much.&nbsp; I can&#8217;t stand it.�&nbsp;&nbsp; 

But none of them left as Ravi used her leisurely and comprehensively.&nbsp; Lifting her from his big cock, displaying her gaping hole, shifting to her mouth.&nbsp; Both moving to the floor.&nbsp; Hardwood against Carol&#8217;s back, then her knees, then her full breasts crushed flat.&nbsp; Ravi showing off.&nbsp; Carol putting on a show for her own amusement.&nbsp; If they were shocked, she would shock them more.

�Oh.&nbsp; Oh.&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; Ohhh.&nbsp; Ohh.&nbsp; Yeah.&nbsp; Ohh.&nbsp; Come on.&nbsp; Come on.&nbsp; Fuck me.&nbsp;&nbsp; Fuck me.&nbsp; Do it to me.&nbsp; Come on.&nbsp; Do it to me.&nbsp; Ohhh.&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp;&nbsp; Ohh.&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; That&#8217;s good.&nbsp; That&#8217;s good.&nbsp; Ohh, god.&nbsp; That&#8217;s good.&nbsp; Like that.&nbsp; Ride my ass.&nbsp; Ride it.&nbsp; Ohh, fuck, ooh.&nbsp; Give it to me.&nbsp;&nbsp; Split me.&nbsp; Make me your ass slut.&nbsp; Fill me.&nbsp; Make me come.&nbsp; I almost.&nbsp; Almost.&nbsp; Please.&nbsp; More.&nbsp; Please.&nbsp; Do it.&nbsp; Harder.�

Yet as she listened to herself acting, the words became real.

Ravi was pounding her painfully into the floor.&nbsp; Lying flat face down.&nbsp; Sharp points of pelvic bones.&nbsp; Breasts mashed.&nbsp; Breathe forced from lungs with each inward thrust.&nbsp; She didn&#8217;t care.&nbsp; Through the pain she was about to have her first anal orgasm.&nbsp; She was almost there.&nbsp; Almost.&nbsp;&nbsp; And then Ravi came and she wasn&#8217;t.

His slight weight rolled from her.&nbsp; 

�Open your ass,� he gasped.&nbsp; �Show them.�

Carol rolled onto her side, raised her left leg and reached down, spread her cheeks, slid two fingers into her closing anus, scooped out come, and raised them to her innocent lips.

Dead silence before one of the boys abruptly bolted for the door.

Only two of the others accompanied Ravi when he entered her condo a week later.


25

�Oh, I&#8217;m sorry.&nbsp; I didn&#8217;t know you were with someone.�&nbsp; 

She glanced at her watch, thinking she had the wrong time.&nbsp; But it read 9:01.

�That&#8217;s all right.&nbsp; Come on in.&nbsp; You know Ralph Linstom, Carol.�

�Y..yes,� she stammered.&nbsp; She had met the owner of a chain of spas at two meetings to discuss&nbsp; the possibility of designing a new corporate headquarters.&nbsp; �Good morning, Mr. Linstom.�

�Ralph,�&nbsp; he smiled.

�Ralph.�&nbsp; Then to Rik, �I&#8217;ll come back later.�

�No.&nbsp; No.&nbsp; Just go on about your usual business.�

And she understood.

�You mean?�

�Yes.&nbsp; Ralph expressed admiration of your beauty, which of course is universal, and when I told him of your true nature, well, he found it difficult to believe.&nbsp; So I phoned Brad and got permission to give him the password to your webcam.&nbsp; Now he can&#8217;t believe his good fortune.&nbsp; He has the Brad Tomalin Seal of Approval, and we have the design commission.&nbsp;&nbsp; Ralph specifically wants you as lead architect.&nbsp; I&#8217;ve cleared your schedule so you can spend the rest of the day with him to, as it were, seal the deal.&nbsp; So get on with it.�

Carol Edward&#8217;s reached for the zipper of her dress.


26

Brad hadn&#8217;t even called himself.&nbsp; The message was relayed by Mrs. Black.&nbsp; �1401 Brunswick.&nbsp; Suite 200.&nbsp; Dr. Sedwick.&nbsp; Noon.�

She googled the address and found it inland, near San Diego State, so she drove.

She had no idea of what Dr. Sedwick was a doctor.&nbsp; Her own father was a surgeon up the coast in Newport Beach, where she had grown up.&nbsp; They&#8217;d been close, but she hadn&#8217;t called for a while.&nbsp; Or even thought of him or her mother.&nbsp; Carol was an only child.&nbsp; They&#8217;d been good parents.&nbsp; She remembered the guilt at wondering what he would think of the photo of her on that open website.&nbsp; Though of course she was certain he didn&#8217;t go to such sites and would never see it.&nbsp; What would he think of her now, driving naked under her dress to an unknown &#8216;doctor&#8217;s&#8216; office to be used in unknown ways.

1401 was a four story brick office building on the corner of Brunswick and University.&nbsp; On the directory in the lobby, she saw that Dr. Sedwick was a dentist.&nbsp; His receptionist turned out to be a pretty young blond with a name tag that read, &#8216;Felicia.&#8217;

�Do you have an appointment?�

�No.&nbsp; But the doctor is expecting me.�

�I&#8217;ll check,� smiled Felicia, pressing a button on a phone.&nbsp; �O.K.&nbsp;&nbsp; Here,� opening a door leading from the waiting room.&nbsp; �An emergency, I guess.�&nbsp; Felicia was a cheerful girl and smiled again.&nbsp; It was a winning smile.&nbsp; �Follow me.�&nbsp; Down a row of patient rooms.&nbsp; Stopping at the third.&nbsp; �This one.&nbsp; The doctor will be with you soon.�

Carol Edwards entered.&nbsp; Dental chair.&nbsp; Light above.&nbsp; Drill to one side.&nbsp;&nbsp; Stool.&nbsp; A swivel chair in front of a computer terminal and other tools.&nbsp; She hesitated before sitting uneasily in the dental chair.
&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&#8216;Soon&#8217; stretched to fifteen minutes before a man energetically&nbsp; entered.&nbsp; The first thing Carol noticed, that anyone would notice, was his shining head.&nbsp; What hair he had on the sides and back had been shaved to a shadow.&nbsp; And the second was his too bright eyes magnified by thick lensed glasses, lost from view as he spun, shut and locked the door.&nbsp; He might be fifty years old or sixty and was wearing a stiffly starched white shirt, tie, and slacks.

He turned back toward her.&nbsp; 

�I&#8217;ve been watching you.�

�Oh?�

�Not here.&nbsp; There.�&nbsp; He pointed at the computer.&nbsp; �On the Internet.&nbsp; Rossedwardswife.net.&nbsp; Brad Tomalin gave me the password.&nbsp; You know what it is?�

�No.�

The bald man&#8217;s face broke into an unpleasant smile, �carollost.&nbsp; That&#8217;s you, isn&#8217;t it?�

�Yes.�

�You are a harlot.�

&#8216;Harlot,&#8217; Carol thought.&nbsp; How quaint.

�Ross Edward&#8217;s wife.&nbsp; A married slut.&nbsp; A disgrace to all respectable American women.&nbsp; To mothers everywhere.&nbsp; Do you have children?�

�No.�

�Thank the Lord.&nbsp; Normally I don&#8217;t see female patients without an assistant present.&nbsp; But then you aren&#8217;t normal.&nbsp; Or a patient.&nbsp; I&#8217;ve let everyone go to lunch.&nbsp; Told them I know you personally and would take care of you myself.&nbsp;&nbsp; I do know you and I will take care of you.&nbsp; What are you wearing under that dress?�

�Nothing.�

�As I thought.&nbsp; Stand up.�

Carol stood.&nbsp; Dr. Sedwick was an inch shorter than she.&nbsp; He spun the swivel chair and sat down.&nbsp; All his motions were jerky.&nbsp; Abrupt.
�Lift your dress.&nbsp; Show me.�

Carol was familiar with fear.&nbsp; Fear was part of it.&nbsp; When Ooni held her underwater panic was natural.&nbsp;&nbsp; And with some of the others when things sometimes seemed to be on the verge of getting out of control.&nbsp; She liked the fear, to a degree; liked being helpless.&nbsp; Because she knew, or thought she did, that Brad&#8217;s limits would be respected, that she would not be killed or permanently injured.&nbsp; But this dentist was different.

There is consolation in not making decisions.&nbsp; Carol bent and pulled her dress to her waist.

Dr. Sedwick&#8217;s eyes fastened on her shaved pubes.&nbsp; �Yes.�&nbsp;&nbsp; He ran his right hand over his skull and his mouth formed a grin or a grimace.

�Turn around.&nbsp; Pull your dress higher.�

For two or three minutes Carol stood while the dentist stared at her ass.&nbsp; �Yes,�&nbsp; he repeated.

�Turn back.�

Facing him, with dread she saw him unfasten his belt and draw it from his waist.&nbsp; He folded it in two, holding the end and the buckle together.

�Confess.�

�To what?�

�To what?&nbsp; That you are a slut, a disgrace, a harlot.�

�I&#8217;m a slut, a disgrace, a harlot.�&nbsp; It was a word she did not recall ever before speaking.

�And you know what we are enjoined to do to harlots?�

�No.�

�We are enjoined to smite them and cast them out.&nbsp; 

�Hold out your hands.&nbsp; Palm up.�

Fearfully, and it was not a good fear if there is good fear, Carol extended her hands.&nbsp; Hem of dress and belt fell.&nbsp; Pain exploded.&nbsp; Carol screamed.

�That&#8217;s fine.&nbsp; No one can hear.�

Burning hands sought refuge in armpits.&nbsp; Body contracted defensively.&nbsp; Knees bent.&nbsp; Upper body leaned forward.&nbsp; Tears on her cheeks.

�Straighten up.�

He noted the tears with satisfaction.

�I&#8217;m sure there are more where those came from.�

�Please.&nbsp; Let me please you.�&nbsp; Carol went to her knees and reached for his zipper with stinging hands.&nbsp; �I can make you feel such pleasure.&nbsp; Don&#8217;t hurt me anymore.�

Angrily he pushed her away.&nbsp; �Do you think I would befoul my member with your vile flesh?&nbsp; Not all men are weak.&nbsp; Your kind cannot tempt us all.&nbsp; Over my lap, face down.�&nbsp; Grabbing her right wrist he dragged her into position.&nbsp; 

Blond hair touched the floor on one side; feet on the other.&nbsp; Carol felt her dress lifted to her waist.&nbsp; A hand moved over her naked ass.&nbsp; Tracing curves.&nbsp; Testing resiliency.&nbsp; Almost caressing.&nbsp; Then the leather belt.&nbsp; Tracing.&nbsp; Caressing.&nbsp; �Please,� she whimpered.&nbsp; And then she screamed.&nbsp; And screamed.&nbsp; And screamed.&nbsp; 

Finally it ended.&nbsp;&nbsp; The bald man abruptly stood, tumbling her from his lap onto the floor.&nbsp; Harsh breathing.&nbsp; Uncontrolled sobs.&nbsp; 

�Get out!&nbsp; My staff are due back.�

When the sobbing fetal positioned form did not move, a black shoe kicked.

�Get out!&nbsp; Now!�

The form rolled onto knees, groaned, crawled toward the door.&nbsp; A latch turned.&nbsp; Pulling itself to its feet, it stumbled blindly into a hall.









27

The flight attendant was the same, the water far below--the Indian Ocean--and the direction--west toward Dubai instead of east to Shanghai--different.

It all washed back over him.&nbsp; Everything he had felt on that earlier flight while Carol was being gangbanged.&nbsp; The all but irresistible urge to grab her, fuck her until her eyes bulged, make her scream.&nbsp; To humiliate her husband as he was being humiliated.&nbsp; 

�Would you like another drink, Mr. Edwards?�

�Yes, please.�

�Gin and tonic?�

�Yes.�

When she returned and set the cool glass down on the arm of his first class seat, he said,&nbsp; �You&#8217;ve changed routes.�

She smiled, pleased at recognition.&nbsp; �No.&nbsp; I&#8217;m still on Shanghai.&nbsp; Just covering today for a friend on vacation.�&nbsp; The name tag on her stylish uniform read &#8216;Lorie&#8217;.&nbsp; She did look like Carol.&nbsp; Some.&nbsp; Enough.&nbsp; Ross glanced at her left hand.&nbsp; Good.&nbsp; She was wearing her wedding ring.&nbsp; That was important.&nbsp; After a brief moment, Lorie added, �I remember you on the Shanghai route often.�

Ross smiled back, making eye contact.&nbsp; �How long are you in Dubai?�

�Two nights.&nbsp; We fly back Thursday.&nbsp; You?�

�The same.&nbsp;&nbsp; I&#8217;m staying at the Dubai Creek.&nbsp; I&#8217;ve seen Singapore Airlines people there in the past.&nbsp; Are you?�

�Yes.�

�If you don&#8217;t have other plans, join me for a drink this evening.&#8217;�
Lorie hesitated only briefly, before, �I&#8217;d enjoy that.&nbsp; I can&#8217;t go to any of the hotel bars alone or even with the other girls.�&nbsp; 

It is common knowledge that almost all Dubai hotels have squads of imported prostitutes who frequent the bars to accommodate visiting Saudis and others.

�Good.&nbsp; The Jockey Bar at 7:00.�

�

The jockeys in the photographs and oil paintings on the bar&#8217;s walls were riding camels not horses.&nbsp; Some of them were mere children, six or seven years old.&nbsp; Though the minimum age to ride professionally had been raised to fifteen to appease international child welfare groups, enforcement is lax when camel racing is favored by the highest ruling family members in feudal societies.&nbsp; 

Ross had never seen a camel race, but remembered hearing that one sheik alone owned more than 10,000 camels and employed 6,000 men to care for and train them.&nbsp; He found himself wondering if the walls of the Kricket Klub were covered with pictures of crickets instead of cricket players.

He had just taken the first sip of a Plymouth Gin martini when he followed the movement of the head of a Japanese businessman at the next table and saw Lorie.&nbsp; She was wearing a sleeveless dress that she wouldn&#8217;t wear on the streets of Dubai, but which was by Western standards modest.

Ross stood as she approached and pulled out a chair for her.

�You look lovely,� he said.&nbsp; �More relaxed than on the plane.�

She smiled thanks, asked what he was drinking, and said she would have the same.

Ross&#8217;s plan was simple and his intentions not much different than those of any man thrown together with a pretty woman in a foreign city.&nbsp; Up to a point.&nbsp; He would seduce her if he could.&nbsp; His techniques were traditional:&nbsp; he was charming, he listened to her, drew her out about herself, appeared interested, and he had already tipped the bar tender to keep the drinks coming.&nbsp; Lorie Hornby did not notice that he had barely touched his second martini while she was finishing her third.&nbsp; She did notice that this nice man, who was successful enough to fly first class and had told her he was separated, with a divorce pending, which might or might not be true, but didn&#8217;t really matter, was looking at her with increasingly open desire, and through a gin haze that was fine with her.&nbsp; More interesting than watching bad television in her room.&nbsp; And no one would ever know.

Ross had learned that Lorie was from Fremantle, in Western Australia; her husband, Stan, a flight engineer for Qantas;&nbsp; they had lived in Singapore for two years; and had two daughters, Pam and Charlie, short for Charlotte, aged 3 and 5.&nbsp; Good, thought Ross.&nbsp; If she goes to my room, she will be a slut mother as well as wife.

Unsteadily, clutching his arm for balance, she did and was.

Inside the room, bodies embraced, lips locked, clothes fell.

Naked, Lorie Hornby was as expected.&nbsp; Child birth had left only slight marks on her body.&nbsp; Her abdomen was flat and firm.&nbsp; Her breasts high and full.&nbsp; Not as big as Carol&#8217;s, but more than a handful.&nbsp; Her legs almost exactly like Carol&#8217;s.&nbsp; Stan was a lucky man.&nbsp; Or not.

Falling on the bed together, her head moved without urging to his groin.&nbsp; To Ross the back of her rising and falling head, sensation of lips and tongue,&nbsp; she was Carol.&nbsp; He almost came and had hurriedly to reach down and pull her away.

He pushed her onto her back and reciprocated.&nbsp; Her pussy was like Carol&#8217;s before shaving.&nbsp; The almost blond curly hair.&nbsp; The taste.&nbsp; He hadn&#8217;t licked a cunt in months.&nbsp; He hadn&#8217;t had sex other than masturbation since all this began.&nbsp; His badly damaged self-esteem began to rise with his cock.

Lorie moaned as he straightened up,&nbsp; circled her ankles with his fingers, separated and bent her long legs, and entered her.&nbsp; She was sopping wet.&nbsp; He slid slowly all the way in.&nbsp; Slowly back.&nbsp; Not wanting to come too soon.&nbsp; Her eyes were closed, not bulging.&nbsp; And she had not yet screamed.

He moved his hands to her breasts and squeezed as he gradually increased the rhythm.&nbsp; Lorie didn&#8217;t seem to mind.&nbsp; In control, knowing there would be a second time, that he wasn&#8217;t going to let her go until he had done everything he wanted to, he slammed hard and came with a roar.

 Lorie groaned, convulsed--Ross wasn&#8217;t sure if she had come and didn&#8217;t care--and fell into open mouthed sleep.

�

An hour later Ross rolled the sleeping Australian onto her stomach, arranged her arms to the sides, outstretched, pushed her legs together.&nbsp; A naked crucifix.&nbsp; Swinging one leg over, he knelt on the back of her thighs.&nbsp; From this angle, unable to see her face or breasts, she was Carol.

Hands spread cheeks.&nbsp; A glob of spit landed on crinkled anus.&nbsp; Probing pressure.&nbsp; Sensing something wrong, Lorie woke.&nbsp; Groggily, �No.&nbsp; Not there.�&nbsp; And then she screamed quite satisfactorily.

�Yes.&nbsp; There.�&nbsp; grunted Ross Edwards.&nbsp; 

Pain quickly sobered her.

�No.&nbsp; Get off.&nbsp; Stop.&nbsp; This is rape.&nbsp; Report...you.�

�Maybe in Australia or America, but you&#8217;ve forgotten where you are.&nbsp; Adulterous women are not treated well under Sharia law.&nbsp;&nbsp; And people saw you join me at the bar.�

Lorie struggled to throw him off, to escape agony.&nbsp; Ross twisted her arms behind her.&nbsp; �I&#8217;ll break your fingers.&nbsp; Good.&nbsp; That&#8217;s better.&nbsp; Don&#8217;t you take it up the ass?�

A whimpered no.

�Never?�

�Once.&nbsp; Twice.&nbsp; Stan wanted to.&nbsp; It hurts too much.�

Ross was pleased.&nbsp; �That&#8217;s what my wife used to say.&nbsp; She seems to have changed her mind.�&nbsp; He paused and reached for a necktie he had slipped under a pillow just in case.

�What are you doing?�

�That&#8217;s obvious.�

She struggled.&nbsp; It was too late.&nbsp; Finishing the knot lashing her wrists together, he pulled his cock from her ass.&nbsp; There was blood and something else.&nbsp; He flipped her onto her back, captured flailing legs, pushed them toward her ears and shoved into her ass again.

�AggahHH!&nbsp; You&#8217;re ripping me.�

�Yes.�&nbsp; With satisfaction.&nbsp; �I am.�

Hands moved past breasts that still bore earlier red prints to throat.&nbsp; Long before he had learned from THE ENGLISH PATIENT that it is called the suprasternal notch, Ross had thought that the vulnerable hollow at the base of the throat one of the loveliest parts of a woman&#8217;s body.&nbsp; He wrapped both hands just above Lorie Hornby&#8217;s suprasternal notch and, continuing to fuck her ass slowly, squeezed until her eyes bulged.
 
In time with inward thrusts:&nbsp; �Carol.&nbsp; Carol.&nbsp; Carol.�

Red face turning blue.&nbsp; Mouth open in silent scream.&nbsp; Tongue lolling.
�

�Why?�&nbsp; Lorie sobbed as she gathered her clothes..&nbsp; �Why did you have to be this way?&nbsp; It could have been a bit of fun.&nbsp; You&#8217;re a monster.�

&#8216;Why, indeed?�&nbsp; 
�

Lorie Hornby was not on the Thursday flight from Dubai to Singapore.&nbsp; Another attendant, a pretty Asian woman, brought his gin and tonic.&nbsp; 

�I thought Lorie was working this flight.�

�You know Lorie?�

�Yes.&nbsp; We had a drink together the other night.�

�She was scheduled, but had to fly to Australia unexpectedly.&nbsp; An Illness in the family, I think�&nbsp; 

�I hope it is not serious.&nbsp; If you see her, give her my regards.�&nbsp; And he handed the attendant, whose name he notice was Xin, a business card.

�I will.�&nbsp; 

Xin smiled and moved on.

Sipping his drink he gazed out the window.&nbsp; A string of atolls far below must be the Maldives.&nbsp; Ross Edwards smiled.&nbsp; He was very pleased with himself.


28

This simply is not possible, thought Carol Edwards.&nbsp; But she&#8217;d thought that before.

�AggahHH!&nbsp; You&#8217;re ripping me.�

�No.&nbsp; I&#8217;m not,� replied Faye, as she forced more of her hand into Carol&#8217;s ass.

�No.&nbsp; NO!&nbsp; Please.&nbsp; Stop.�&nbsp; And then knuckles passed and Carol Edwards was proven wrong again.

I can&#8217;t believe that there is a hand up my ass.

The audience gave the hand a hand.

Carol could glimpse only a few of the woman staring down at her naked on her back on the floor of the Fur Ball, a lesbian club in Laguna Beach.&nbsp; 

Faye had driven them up from San Diego that Friday night, promising a new experience.

Carol had never before seen Faye in a dress.&nbsp; Black, simple; having nothing to cling to but shoulders it hung sadly straight.&nbsp; Faye also was atypically wearing lipstick, eye shadow, and shoes with 2� heels.

Only ten miles from her parent&#8217;s house, Carol had often been to Laguna Beach.&nbsp; With college friends she had checked out the gay bars for kicks.&nbsp; The Fur Ball was new.&nbsp; So was this Carol.

Faye had told her to dress as though for the office, but had her remove the blouse from beneath the two piece peach colored business suit.&nbsp; With Carol&#8217;s breasts, naturally this exposed some but not excessive cleavage.

The Fur Ball&#8217;s decor was Hemingway&#8217;s Paris.&nbsp; The bar was zinc topped.&nbsp; The stools and tables bistro small.&nbsp; Most of them were occupied; and Carol felt an anticipatory gleam in many of the eyes passing over her as they entered.

On the way to an empty table that seemed to have been reserved for them, Faye was greeted by several women, all of whom like her were dressed as if for a ladies&#8217; tea, in deliberate parody of their own mothers.&nbsp; No leather.&nbsp; No pants.&nbsp; No boots.&nbsp; Nothing even slightly butch.

Without asking what Carol wanted, Faye ordered two glasses of white wine.&nbsp; 

Conversations resumed around them.&nbsp; They seemed to be forgotten. But the room spontaneously hushed when Faye finished her wine and took Carol by the hand and led her to a small dance floor between bar and tables.

�Hello, ladies.�

�Hello, Faye.�&nbsp; came the response.

�This is my...friend, Carol.&nbsp; Say &#8216;hello&#8217; Carol.�

�Hello.�

�Hello, Carol.�&nbsp; Enthusiastically.

�I&#8217;m sure you all will agree that Carol is very beautiful.�

�Agree.�&nbsp; �Agree.�&nbsp; Laughter.

�And innocent.&nbsp; Well, at least she looks innocent.�&nbsp; More laughter.&nbsp; �Turn around so that everyone can see how innocent you look.�

Carol Edwards turned, facing the women at the bar who were behind her, then again those at the tables.&nbsp; Some eyes met hers.&nbsp; Some were lower.

�We all know that looks can deceive--though I doubt anyone thinks I&#8217;m straight.�&nbsp; Laughter.&nbsp; Then to Carol, �What are you?�

Confused.&nbsp; �What am I?�

�Your job.&nbsp; What do you do?�

After momentary hesitation, �I&#8217;m an architect.�

�Is that what you wear to the office?�

�With a blouse, yes.�

�The only change is the addition of a blouse?�

�Yes.�

�What are you wearing beneath that suit?�

�Nothing.�

�Nothing?&nbsp; You go to the office that way.�

�You know I do.�

�How many people have you had sex with in the past week?�

�I...I don&#8217;t have any idea.�

�None?&nbsp; Five?&nbsp; Twenty-five?&nbsp; One hundred?�

�More than twenty-five, less than a hundred.�

�How many today?�

�How many people or how many times?�

�People.&nbsp; We wouldn&#8217;t want to strain you to count the times.�&nbsp; 

Laughter.

�Five men and you.�

�Woo.�&nbsp; �Way to go, Faye, girl.�

�How?�

�I sucked off two.&nbsp; Took two in the ass.&nbsp; One of them in both.&nbsp; And I went down on you.�

�You&#8217;re not so innocent.�

�I didn&#8217;t say I was.�

Spade hand slapped face.

�Don&#8217;t be impertinent.

�You said you are an architect, but you really are a slut, aren&#8217;t you?�

�Both.�

With one hand, Faye grabbed a fistful of Carol&#8217;s hair, and with the other slapped her face again.

�But mostly slut.�

�Ye..yes.�

�Say it.�

�I&#8217;m a slut.�

�Show us.&nbsp; Strip.�

Stripping was easy.&nbsp; Two buttons undid her suit jacket, which was pulled from her shoulders by a woman behind her and placed on the zinc bar.&nbsp; A snap, a zipper, and her skirt fell.&nbsp; Habits of neatness.&nbsp; Someone picked it up and folded it carefully, before laying it on top of the jacket.&nbsp;&nbsp; Carol shivered as a fingernail traced a path down her spine to the cleft of her ass.

�Turn again so that everyone can see it.�

&#8216;It,&#8216; Carol thought and did.&nbsp; This time no eyes were on her face.

When she was again facing the tables, Faye reached out and hefted Carol&#8217;s right breast, fingers beneath, thumb caressing, before bending and taking the sensitive nipple in her mouth.&nbsp;&nbsp; Faye bit gently.&nbsp;&nbsp; Carol&#8217;s head went back and she moaned.&nbsp; Attracted by exposed throat, Faye&#8217;s mouth moved upward and her tongue licked Carol&#8217;s suprasternal notch, bringing eager sounds from the audience and a deeper moan from Carol Edwards.

A hand on her shoulder exerted only slight pressure.&nbsp; Enough for the well-trained to go to her knees.&nbsp; Faye lifted her black dress and spread her feet.&nbsp; Carol&#8217;s head moved forward.&nbsp; Tongue extended. Licked.

�Hold my dress,� Faye gasped to no one in particular.&nbsp; Hands obliged, enabling her to pull Carol&#8217;s face tighter, using the kneeling form to balance her own trembling legs until with a guttural groan and copious juices she came.

When Faye regained her breath, she shrugged her dress back into place.

�I promised this beautiful slut with, I must say, a very talented tongue, as I&#8217;m sure many if not all of you will agree before the night is over, a new experience.&nbsp; That is not so easy.&nbsp; She already has done almost everything imaginable.�

Someone giggled.&nbsp; �I&#8217;ll bet I can think of something.�

Another voice, �So can I.�

�Perhaps, ladies.&nbsp; Perhaps.&nbsp; You&#8217;ll get your chances.&nbsp; But for now, not so little lost Carol, on your back.�

�Take her ankles and pull her feet till her toes touch the floor beside her head.�&nbsp; Volunteers were eager to assist.

�Spread your ass.�

Bowed in two, Carol reached up to her elevated ass.&nbsp; Something wet and slippery poured over cracks, dribbled down her back and belly, reached the lower slopes of her upside down breasts.&nbsp; Faye&#8217;s fingers spread and rubbed, circled Carol&#8217;s anus, opened, poured oil in.&nbsp; Fingers followed.&nbsp; Carol Edwards thought, &#8216;This is not possible.�

When her hand was entirely in, Faye said, �You can let her ankles go.�

Legs flopped forward.&nbsp; Carol&#8217;s body straightened.&nbsp; Feet now flat on the floor on either side of Faye.&nbsp; The fist felt even bigger in this position, but hurt less.&nbsp; Until Faye began to move.

Carol&#8217;s hands scrambled frantically for Faye&#8217;s forearm.&nbsp; �Please.&nbsp; No.�
But Faye was too strong.

�Touch yourself.�

Carol gave up her futile efforts and did.&nbsp; Fingers on clit.&nbsp; Pleasure beginning a familiar mix with pain.

�Can I come?�

�Yes.&nbsp; But not that way.�

Faye stopped moving her arm.&nbsp; �Fist yourself.�

Carol&#8217;s eyes widened.

�You&#8217;re not the only woman in this room who fists herself.&nbsp; Do it.�&nbsp; Emphasizing the command by squeezing her own fist.

�Wait.&nbsp; Please.&nbsp; Don&#8217;t.&nbsp; I&#8217;ll try.�

Normally to fist herself was no longer difficult, but her body was crowded.&nbsp; Her fingers encountered the bulge of Faye&#8217;s hand.&nbsp; Pushed.&nbsp; Flesh stretched.&nbsp; Organs shifted.&nbsp;&nbsp; Sweat formed on Carol Edwards&#8217; face.&nbsp; What must child birth be like?&nbsp; Something slipped.&nbsp; She was in, and she was in shock.&nbsp; Two hands.&nbsp; The sound of one hand clapping.&nbsp; The sound of two hands clapping.&nbsp; But they couldn&#8217;t quite, separated by wet tissue. 

�Now you can make yourself come.�

Faye&#8217;s arm began to move.&nbsp; Carol&#8217;s too.&nbsp;&nbsp; She stared up into a sea of feral faces.

�Hello, Ross, from Las Vegas, fun capital of the world.

Flew up for the long weekend.&nbsp; Staying at the Galaxy.&nbsp; On the forty-forth floor.&nbsp; Beautiful view.&nbsp; Views.&nbsp; Outside is spectacular.&nbsp; But I like the one inside better

Say hello to Ross, girls.�

Two voices, almost simultaneously.&nbsp; �Hello, Ross.�

� &#8216;Brandi&#8217; with an &#8216;i&#8217; and Roxanne.&nbsp; Brandi is 21, blond, 5&#8217;4�, stacked and interested in preserving the rain forest.&nbsp; Roxanne is 6&#8217; 0�, red haired, also stacked, a former college diving champion, and collects stamps.&nbsp; Secretly I always wanted to MC a beauty pageant.

Both young ladies are beautiful, naked, enthusiastic, and, take my word for it, talented.&nbsp; They are spending the night with me.&nbsp; They are also, as you must have guessed, shall we say &#8216;professionals&#8217;.&nbsp; Do you girls mind being called &#8216;hookers&#8217;?

They don&#8217;t care for &#8216;hookers.&#8217;

I don&#8217;t pay for it.&nbsp; Must have some principles.&nbsp; They are a gift from you lovely wife, who is earning them for me.

We spent some time downstairs, Brandi, Roxanne and I, watching her work the bar.&nbsp; Woman is a natural.&nbsp; But then we knew that.&nbsp; I know some people at the hotel, so no problems.&nbsp; We rode up in the elevator with Carol and her third client.&nbsp; From your part of the world.&nbsp; Chinese.&nbsp; Japanese.&nbsp; Can&#8217;t tell.&nbsp; They got off on the thirty-ninth floor.&nbsp; Oriental man not inscrutable.&nbsp; Oriental man very excited.&nbsp; Very.&nbsp; Be surprised if his yellow dick isn&#8217;t buried in her ass this very moment.&nbsp; Don&#8217;t you think so, ladies?�

�He certainly couldn&#8217;t keep his hands off it in the elevator,� said Brandi or Roxanne.

�That&#8217;s all for now, Ross.

Brandi and Roxanne are deservedly high-priced.&nbsp; Carol is going to have a long night.�

Ross Edwards turned off the answering machine.

&#8216;That&#8217;s all right.&nbsp; Sell her whore ass.&#8217;

His cock was hard, but he didn&#8217;t masturbate.&nbsp; Upon returning from Dubai he had almost thrown away all his toys, but then the thought occurred that he might want to use them on others.&nbsp; And he had kept the card to the Kricket Klub.&nbsp; That might be interesting, too.

He left his apartment on his way to have an innocent, or not, lunch with the wife of a friend.

As he waited for the elevator, he found himself wondering if Brad Tomalin had a daughter.&nbsp; 


30

Not all hands on asses are equal.

The hand of a customer groping a call girl&#8217;s ass in a Las Vegas elevator is hardly noticed.&nbsp; Another hand on that same ass in a different situation can be life-changing.

Rik Cronin decided to hold the annual company retreat at a spa in Indian Wells.&nbsp; Three days, two nights of corporate fun and bonding, with a few seminars thrown in to make it tax deductible.&nbsp; As he, and Brad Tomalin intended, word quickly spread that he had specifically instructed that Carol Edwards be lodged in the suite next to his with a connecting door.

No one has a face that can actually stop a clock; but a few women are beautiful enough to stop traffic.&nbsp; Carol Edwards was one of them.&nbsp; It had happened many times, beginning in her teens.&nbsp; Literally.&nbsp; Standing on a corner waiting to cross the street.&nbsp; Men behind wheels, looked and were lost, not noticing when the light changed until someone behind them honked. 

When she entered a restaurant. Heads turned.&nbsp; Conversations were interrupted.&nbsp;&nbsp; Not always.&nbsp; But often.

But even by those standards, the world stood still when she walked out to the spa pool.

Rik Cronin and almost all the other staff were already out there.&nbsp; He told her to wait ten minutes before joining him in attire provided by Brad Tomalin.

Carol Edwards was wearing four inch high backless sandals.&nbsp; That was certain.&nbsp; Whether she was wearing a bathing suit was open to debate.&nbsp; Some might say &#8216;yes&#8217;; most would probably say &#8216;no.&#8217;&nbsp; A few inches of flesh colored string; the postage stamp top not wide enough to completely cover her areolae, which extended on either side; the bottom vanishing in clefts.

Behind sunglasses her eyes were the only part of her not visible.

The world watched breathlessly as she walked to Rik Cronin and stretched out face down on the lounge chair beside his. 

When she seemed comfortable Rik said, �Could you help me, Carol, with this sun tan lotion?&nbsp; I can&#8217;t reach my back.�

She rolled over, sat up, leaned toward him and took the tube, squeezed lotion onto his mottled back, and rubbed.

�Lower,�&nbsp; he muttered.

Long fingers moved lower, down to the roll of fat protruding above the elastic waistband of his trucks.

�Ahh.&nbsp; That&#8217;s good.�

Rik sat up.&nbsp; 

�Now I&#8217;ll do you.�

It was difficult to tell.&nbsp; Something seemed to flicker behind her dark glasses, but Carol Edwards lay back on her chair.

Every eye watched. Lotion squeezing from tube seemed somehow obscene.&nbsp; Rubbed into shoulders, slopes of breasts, belly, thighs, calves, feet.

�The other side.�
 
Carol rolled over.

Fingers untied a knot.&nbsp; A string more symbolic than concealing fell away. 

Rik Cronin&#8217;s efforts to protect the already tan Carol Edwards from sun burn were as comprehensive as they were exemplary.&nbsp; Finally satisfied, he stopped, and lay back, a beached whale wearing Hawaiian shorts, on his own chair.

And the world exhaled.

...

A half an hour was long enough, Rik thought impatiently.&nbsp; Beyond the half moon of his belly, Hawaii had sprouted a new mountain peak.

�Let&#8217;s go,� he said as he bent to retie strings.

Carol rolled over, sat up, slipped on her too high heeled sandals.

As they walked around the pool, Rik said, �You know everyone is picturing us naked together in five minutes.&nbsp; And the great thing is, no matter what they image, you have and will do worse.�

�Yes.�

He dropped one hand to her essentially naked ass and let it rest there&nbsp; casually and proprietarily, feeling undulations as one long leg took a stride, then the other.

&#8216;This is the end of whatever professional credibility I had left,&#8217; Carol Edwards realized.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8216;The end.&#8217;

Which was just what Brad Tomalin wanted.









31

And then one afternoon it ended with a single word.&nbsp; Or seemed to.

�

Ransom--as in �He cost a king&#8217;s ransom,� as Joyce Russell frequently reminded her husband, Buzz--was frantic.&nbsp; 

Usually Ransom had the run of the Russell&#8217;s avocado grove near Escondido, thirty miles northeast of San Diego, but today he was confined to his kennel.&nbsp; 

Ransom was handsome, as Joyce also frequently noted, 127 pounds--which happened to be exactly what Carol Edwards weighed these days--of champion Great Dane, who more than earned his purchase price in stud fees of one kind or another.

Ransom paced and pranced.&nbsp; Ransom barked, growled and whined.&nbsp; Ransom drooled from both ends:&nbsp; streams of saliva rolling over his pink tongue and black lips; streams of other fluids from the tip of his red Great Dane size penis that kept protruding from and retreating into its furry sheath.&nbsp; 

A bitch in heat was nearby.&nbsp; Ransom could not see her.&nbsp; She did not reply to his barks.&nbsp; But he could smell her.&nbsp; Ransom opened his long jaws, exposing perfect teeth, and howled.&nbsp; 

And this time he got results.&nbsp; At the sight of Buzz Russell Ransom stood upright on his hind legs, more than six feet tall, forepaws on the kennel&#8217;s chain link fence, and yelped a greeting, quivering with anticipation from wet black nose to long black tail.

Ransom knew better than jump on Buzz when Buzz opened the gate.&nbsp; Buzz Russell outweighed Ransom by a hundred pounds, and though Ransom was his favorite, had no use for disobedient dogs.&nbsp; Or people.

�Hold still,� he said.&nbsp; Half laughing at the dog&#8217;s evident excitement.&nbsp; �You&#8217;ll get it soon.&nbsp; Hold still, I said,� as he hooked a chain leash to Ransom&#8217;s wide leather collar.&nbsp; When Ransom pulled toward the kennel gate, Buzz jerked him back.&nbsp; �Stay.&nbsp; We&#8217;re not going anywhere until you sit.�

Ransom sat and stared up at Buzz with pleading eyes.

�All right.&nbsp; Good dog.&nbsp; Now walk.&nbsp; Normal pace.�

Although the smell of bitch grew stronger, Ransom walked beside Buzz and did not pull on his leash.&nbsp; The big dog had no concept of patience, but he had been well conditioned.&nbsp; He had been through this many times before, and he had always gotten his reward.&nbsp; Part of his doggy brain was troubled as they turned away from the other kennels toward the house and the smell of bitch in heat receded.

When Buzz opened the back screen door, Ransom looked up at him inquiringly.&nbsp; �It&#8217;s o.k.&nbsp; Go ahead.�

Ransom&#8217;s nails clicked on the kitchen&#8217;s tile floor.

�Stop.&nbsp; Sit.�

Ransom sat while Buzz laced leather boots over his paws, one by one.&nbsp; There was a new smell here.&nbsp; A different kind of sex.&nbsp; Ransom remembered it.&nbsp; 

�Good dog.�

The smell grew stronger as they passed through the dining room and entered the living room.&nbsp; Ransom could not suppress a quick bark of recognition.&nbsp; This was one of those furless bitches.&nbsp; Ransom was not familiar with Twentieth Century poetry, but in his small brain he paraphrased Gertrude Stein:&nbsp; a bitch is a bitch is a bitch.&nbsp; Smooth skin.&nbsp; Odd shape.&nbsp; Made strange noises.&nbsp; But warm wet holes that felt good.&nbsp; Ransom&#8217;s cock jutted from its sheath.

Carol Edwards entire body trembled.&nbsp; The doggie position she assumed at 8:30 every night in her home was particularly appropriate.&nbsp; And she certainly smelled of sex.&nbsp; Joyce Russell&#8217;s juices covered her face.&nbsp; Buzz Russell&#8217;s come leaked from her asshole.&nbsp; Brad Tomalin&#8217;s come from her cunt.

Joyce and Brad were sitting together on the sofa with a side view of Carol.&nbsp; Joyce&#8217;s skirt was back down.&nbsp; She did not herself have sex with Ransom, but she liked to watch him take others.&nbsp; 

Joyce and Buzz were a perfect match.&nbsp; Both cruel jests of nature.&nbsp; Perfect bodies topped by homely, even ugly faces.&nbsp; From the neck down Joyce was nearly Carol Edwards&#8217;s equal.&nbsp; From the neck up.&nbsp; Well, from the neck up, Joyce had a face that men joked about covering with a paper bag in order to fuck her.&nbsp; She&#8217;d heard the jokes.&nbsp; They&#8217;d hurt.&nbsp; And until she&#8217;d been fortunate enough to meet Buzz, she&#8217;d had to put up with them.&nbsp; With Buzz she didn&#8217;t have to any more.&nbsp; They loved one another just as they were.&nbsp; But they had decided not to risk having children.

Joyce loved seeing the beautiful faces of other women twist in surprise, shock, pain and horror as Ransom fucked them, as his knot enlarged, as his animal come boiled out, as helpless woman and dog were locked together for long minutes.

Carol Edwards heard the dog&#8217;s wild panting.&nbsp; She closed her eyes.

�Keep your eyes open,� ordered Brad.&nbsp; �And your face toward us.�

She opened her eyes.&nbsp; The black dog&#8217;s hot breath was on her ass.&nbsp; She heard him sniff.&nbsp; A rough wet tongue licked her crack.

�No!�&nbsp; 

Carol scrambled forward.&nbsp; Away.

�No.&nbsp; I can&#8217;t do this.�

Ransom growled.

Buzz was ready.&nbsp; Brad had told him what to expect.&nbsp; �Good dog.&nbsp; That&#8217;s o.k.�&nbsp; His forearm knotted as he pulled the massive neck back.&nbsp; �Good dog.&nbsp; Come this way.&nbsp; I&#8217;ve another bitch for you.�
32

She did not know what to do.

Carol Edwards was sitting on the sofa in a living room of long shadows.&nbsp; Alone.&nbsp; Empty.

Brad had not been angry on the drive home, rather he was cheerful, almost pleased, but she didn&#8217;t know at what.&nbsp; A fulfilled expectation?&nbsp; To be rid of her?

The drive had been mostly in silence.&nbsp; Not even Brad&#8217;s usual classical music.&nbsp; Until finally, desperately, Carol had stammered out one of her earliest memories.&nbsp; She was walking with her mother.&nbsp; The details were vague.&nbsp; It must have been near their home.&nbsp; She had seen two dogs back to back on a lawn.&nbsp; Anxious expressions on both faces.&nbsp; �Look how the funny doggies are playing, Mommy,�&nbsp; she had said.&nbsp; Her mother had not noticed them, but when she did, took Carol&#8217;s tiny hand and walked faster.&nbsp; Carol turned her head to keep the dogs in view.&nbsp; One began to hop, trying to get free, tugging the other backwards, who yelped in surprise and pain.&nbsp; �What are they doing, Mommy?�&nbsp; �Nothing dear.&nbsp; Just playing.&nbsp; Come along.�

But the memory stayed with Carol, and when several years later her father asked if she would like to have a puppy, he was surprised at how vehemently she said no.&nbsp; 

�I want to do everything,� Carol Edwards told Brad Tomalin, �but I can&#8217;t do that.�

Brad said nothing, and when they reached her condo, he waited for her to open her door and get out, and he drove off. She watched the&nbsp; silver Lexis disappear and knew she would never hear from him again.

Carol turned and walked into the building, rode up to her unit, showered, threw on a top and skirt and sat on the sofa, not even bothering to make herself a drink.

What did she do now?&nbsp; 
A forlorn voice in her mind said she could telephone Ross.&nbsp; But that was absurd.&nbsp; She didn&#8217;t want Ross.&nbsp; He didn&#8217;t even seem real.&nbsp; Not someone she had known, slept with, married, thought she loved.&nbsp; More like a character, and a minor character at that, in a movie she had once seen.

How long ago had it been, that fateful charity dinner?&nbsp; Not quite a year of her thirty-three.&nbsp; Yet nothing before that night seemed real.&nbsp; And now everything that had happened since was at an end.

The shadows deepened.&nbsp; Filled the room with darkness.&nbsp; The sun set.&nbsp; 

With a start, she looked across to the digital time on the television cablebox.&nbsp; 8:32.&nbsp; She turned on a light.&nbsp; All the lights.&nbsp; The curtains to the balcony were open as always.&nbsp; The door unlocked.&nbsp; She pulled off her top and skirt and knelt as she had that afternoon.&nbsp; A shiver passed over her as she remembered the horrid touch of the huge dog&#8217;s wet tongue.&nbsp; 

She knelt waiting, knowing that no one would come.


Before she went to bed, she routinely checked her email.&nbsp; Momentary elation at one from Brad, until she opened it and found:&nbsp; Your morning rounds have been cancelled.

�

Monday morning she nicked herself shaving.&nbsp; Not seriously, but she didn&#8217;t want blood on her skirt and it took a while to be certain.&nbsp; 

At 8:58 she left her office and walked the short distance to Rik Cronin&#8217;s.&nbsp; The door handle did not turn.&nbsp; She jiggled it.&nbsp; Then turned herself to find his assistant watching with an amused smile. 

�Rik said he is not to be disturbed.�

Carol stood a little straighter.&nbsp; She would not appear defeated.&nbsp; And returned to her own office, where she realized that since she was no longer the company whore she had nothing to do.

Rik did not summon her.&nbsp; Brad did not call.&nbsp; No one called.&nbsp; 

At noon she went out and ate alone at a nearby cafe.&nbsp; She could not recall the last time she had not had sex for lunch on a weekday.

�

Evening.&nbsp; 

Carol Edwards sat naked on the sofa, finishing her dinner of a pitcher of martinis.&nbsp; She had come home from work, stripped, and not bothered to put on any other clothes.&nbsp; She knew she was drunk.&nbsp; A sudden thought.&nbsp; Clumsily she picked up her MacBook Air, opened Safari, and typed in rossedwardswife.net.&nbsp; After a few seconds an error message appeared:&nbsp; unable to find server.&nbsp; She typed in the address of the gallery Brad had opened after that first gangbang and been adding to ever since.&nbsp;&nbsp; It, too, was down.

She ate the olive from her martini and poured the last from the shaker into her glass, but didn&#8217;t drink it.&nbsp; Instead she stood unsteadily and staggered out to the balcony.&nbsp; The sun had already set and as usual all the lights, including the one on the balcony, were already on.&nbsp; She fell into a deck chair and, after a while, managed to get her bare feet up on the balcony railing.&nbsp; She slid them apart, wide, as she had spread them into a V for the first strangers at Brad&#8217;s place in Julian.&nbsp; Lights were on in buildings farther along the crest.&nbsp; She reached down and pulled her cunt lips painfully far apart.&nbsp; &#8216;Look at me,&#8217; she thought, silently pleading.&nbsp; &#8216;Look at me!&#8217;

With her forefinger she touched her clit.&nbsp; That felt good.&nbsp; A finger from the other hand entered her.&nbsp; Then another.&nbsp; Then her entire hand.&nbsp; Shoving in and out.&nbsp; Pulling tender folds of skin.&nbsp; She began screaming, �Fuck me.&nbsp; Fuck me.&nbsp; Fuck me.�&nbsp; She didn&#8217;t care who saw.&nbsp; She didn&#8217;t care who heard.&nbsp; Her body bucked.&nbsp; Labia clenched wrist.&nbsp; She came, tears streaming down her face.

When her convulsions ended, she managed to pull herself to her feet and make her way all the way to the back of the condo, to the master bathroom, where she fell on her knees on the hard tile, lifted the toilet seat, inserted her head, reached up blindly, slender hand, elegant red-tipped fingers, fumbling, until they found the lever, and flushed.


33

Carol Edwards didn&#8217;t go to work the next day.&nbsp; She had a brutal hangover, but that wasn&#8217;t the reason.&nbsp; There simply was no point.

Coffee helped.&nbsp; And a long bath.&nbsp; By afternoon she was feeling human again, but then remembered that she wasn&#8217;t. 

She knew that she could get dressed and go out to any of a number of bars and find someone to fuck her, although it wasn&#8217;t quite that simple.&nbsp; Most men were intimated by her looks, both in an out of bed.&nbsp; And it wouldn&#8217;t be the kind of sex she needed.&nbsp; She would have control.&nbsp; Women did in modern societies.&nbsp; &#8216;No&#8217; meant &#8216;no.&#8217;&nbsp; But she didn&#8217;t want it to.&nbsp; And she would have to make decisions.&nbsp; She couldn&#8217;t just go into a bar and say, �Anyone, everyone, here can do anything he wants to me.&nbsp;&nbsp; Please fuck me senseless.�&nbsp; Or could she?&nbsp; Maybe somewhere, but not any place she knew.

At 6:00 p.m. she made herself a single drink, a weak gin and tonic, just to have something to do to kill time.&nbsp; She sipped it slowly, sitting naked again on the balcony, gazing down at the lights coming on around the harbor.

By 7:00 everyone should be home from work.&nbsp; 

Carol pulled on her trench coat and, not bothering with shoes, walked down to the fourth floor and lifted Ravi&#8217;s elephant head knocker.&nbsp; She heard sounds.&nbsp; She saw the light darken behind the peephole and opened her coat wide.&nbsp; The door remained closed.

�Ravi, I know you are there.�

The door remained closed and after a while she tried another door.

She left Faye for last, and Faye opened her door.&nbsp; 

Carol let her coat fall to the hallway floor.

�Please use me.&nbsp; I know you love me.&nbsp; I&#8217;ll be your slave.&nbsp; I&#8217;ll be good.�

Faye smiled ruefully.&nbsp; �I&#8217;m not smiling at you, but at myself.&nbsp; Who would have ever thought I&#8217;d turn down so&nbsp; beautiful a woman.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t love you, but I could have.�&nbsp; And she, too, shut the door in Carol&#8217;s face.

The naked woman bent down for her coat, but she didn&#8217;t bother to put it on.
 
�

Brad Tomalin did not answer his cell phone.&nbsp; She had not expected him to.&nbsp; She left the message in his voice mail and sent an email.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I will do anything you tell me to.&nbsp; Anything.&nbsp; Carol

At first she had written:&nbsp; I will do anything you ask.&nbsp; But he had never asked.&nbsp; She didn&#8217;t want to be asked.&nbsp; Not asking was the point.&nbsp; 


34

Two mornings later Carol Edwards put on her &#8216;hooker&#8217; dress, the one Brad had given her to wear that night in Las Vegas.&nbsp; It was crimson, thin, and what there was of it, clingy.&nbsp; Backless almost to her ass, with a halter top that tied behind her neck, and cut in front almost to her navel.&nbsp; When she stood the hem fell just below her crotch.&nbsp; When she sat it didn&#8217;t.&nbsp; Barely legal, but more bare than legal.&nbsp; Untie the top and the dress would fall away like a leaf.&nbsp; She would be naked in a second.

She stepped into the backless black heels she knew he liked and looked at herself in the full length mirror.&nbsp; She could move to Las Vegas and become a full time whore.&nbsp; She could call Ooni and be his full time slave.&nbsp; She did not know what power Brad had over everyone else, but Ooni was rich and independent.&nbsp; Nothing more than passing thoughts.&nbsp; She rode the elevator down, got into her yellow Beetle, and drove to Brad&#8217;s office building.&nbsp; 

Riding the elevator up to the thirty-first floor, she ignored the stares.&nbsp; After all she had ridden this elevator with come dripping&nbsp; from her face.&nbsp; Bare skin was nothing.

The ever immaculate Mrs. Black glanced up from her desk and said, �Well.&nbsp; Well.�

�Is he in?�

�I have been given clear instructions not to provide you with that information.�

Carol Edwards walked past her and tried to open Brad&#8217;s office door.&nbsp; It was locked.&nbsp; Turning, she said, �Will you please tell him that I&#8217;m here?�

�I can&#8217;t do that either.�

�Then I&#8217;ll wait.�

As she sat down on the sofa, even the unflappable Amanda Black&#8217;s eyes widened.


The morning passed slowly.

Brad did not come out.&nbsp; No one else went in.&nbsp; Carol concluded that he really was not there.&nbsp; But she remained.

At noon Mrs. Black locked some papers in her desk and left.&nbsp; When she returned an hour later, Carol Edwards was still there, and she took pity.

�I really shouldn&#8217;t tell you this, but there is another entrance to his office.&nbsp; He&#8217;ll never come this way while you are here.�

Carol smiled.&nbsp; �Thank you.&nbsp; But I&#8217;ll wait.�

She ate nothing.&nbsp; She left only once briefly to use the restroom.

At 5:00 Mrs. Black stood. 
 
�You have to go now.�

�Tell him I&#8217;ll be back tomorrow.�

�Really, you shouldn&#8217;t.�

�

Carol Edwards sat through a second day.&nbsp; Same dress.&nbsp; Same shoes.&nbsp; Same slowly dragging hours.&nbsp; However more of the staff did find reasons to stop by Amanda Black&#8217;s desk that day.

�

Shortly after 10:00 a.m. on the third morning of her desperate vigil, the door to Brad Tomalin&#8217;s office opened.&nbsp; 

Ignoring Carol Edwards as though she were invisible instead of blatantly eye-catching, he crossed to Amanda Black, leaned over and exchanged a few quiet words, than started to walk right past Carol.&nbsp; But she reached out and grabbed his hand and would not let go.&nbsp; He stopped and turned, face impassive.

�I&#8217;ll do it.&nbsp; I&#8217;ll do anything,�&nbsp; she pleaded.

He remained silent.

�Please.&nbsp; I&#8217;m begging.�

�You&#8217;ve said that before.�

�I know.&nbsp; And I have.&nbsp; Everything but this.&nbsp; And I&#8217;ve told you why it&#8217;s so difficult.&nbsp; But&#8217;ll I&#8217;ll do it.&nbsp; I have to.�

�What will you do?�

�What you want.�

�What exactly?�

�What you wanted me to do Sunday.�

He pulled his hand from her grip and started to turn.

Hurriedly, �I&#8217;ll fuck the dog.�

Brad stopped.&nbsp; �Will you now?�

�Yes.�

�And will you suck the dog, too?�

She swallowed nervously.&nbsp; �Yes.�

�Say it.�

�I&#8217;ll suck the dog.�

�And swallow his doggy come?�

�I&#8217;ll swallow his come.�

�And what about other animals?&nbsp; How about a donkey?&nbsp; They still have donkey shows in Tijuana.&nbsp; Will you fuck a Mexican donkey?&nbsp;&nbsp; How about a horse?&nbsp; Or a pig?&nbsp; I believe they have corkscrew cocks.&nbsp; I&#8217;m not quite sure how that works.&nbsp; Will you fuck a pig?�

Half sobbing.&nbsp; �Anything.&nbsp; I&#8217;ll do anything you say.�

�Have you ever seen an act of bestiality, Mrs. Black.�

�No.&nbsp; I have not.�

�Would you like to?�

�It is not...something I have ever considered.�

Brad took out his cell phone and pushed a button.&nbsp; 

�Hi.&nbsp; Tonight at 8?&nbsp; O.K.�&nbsp; Then to Amanda Black, �Here,� and he wrote something on the back of a business card and handed it to her.&nbsp; �If you, or your husband, decide, for the novelty, this is the address.�

Most people spend their lives clothed.&nbsp; Sleep in pajamas or a nightgown.&nbsp; Naked only for a few minutes in the morning and evening; in a shower or bath; twenty or thirty minutes a week--if they�re lucky--during sex; and that is it.&nbsp; More than twenty-three hours out of every twenty-four covered.&nbsp; And Brad Tomalin, for one, thought that for most people that is a very good thing.&#8232;
Carol Edwards, however, now spent most of her life naked.&nbsp; She slept naked.&nbsp; When she woke on weekdays she was soon naked again in various units in her building.&nbsp; Clothed for only an hour before she was naked on her knees in front of Rik Cronin.&nbsp; Often naked again during the morning and afternoon in her office or his.&nbsp; Naked somewhere at lunch.&nbsp; Naked in her condo from at least 8:30 p.m.&nbsp; Sometimes earlier when Brad told her to stop by his office on her way home or showed up at the condo, naturally unannounced.&nbsp; 

And even when she wasn�t naked, she nearly was, as now standing in the center of the Russell's� crowded living room.&nbsp; That was soon rectified.&nbsp; She reached behind her neck, untied a knot, and her little crimson dress fluttered to the floor like a leaf.&nbsp; Stepping out of her shoes, she was naked in a room of fully dressed people.

Ravi was there, along with several others from the condo; but not Faye.&nbsp; Amanda Black was there, as immaculate as ever, her fine legs with knees and ankles properly together, sitting beside a distinguished silver haired man, equally impeccable in a dark blue double-breasted suit, Carol assumed was her husband.&nbsp; 

Others she knew.&nbsp; Some from her office.&nbsp; Some from Brad�s.&nbsp; Some who had used her at her home or elsewhere.&nbsp; Dr. Sedwick was there.&nbsp; Carol shuddered to think what he would do to her if Brad sent her to him after this.&nbsp; Ooni was there.&nbsp; And many strangers.&nbsp; All had appeared on such short notice that Carol realized that Brad had been confident of her capitulation.

Conversations ceased as the red dress fell.&nbsp; 

Brad, who had been leaning against a wall, and Joyce Russell, who had been sitting beside Ravi, approached her.&nbsp; 

�Lift your hair.�

Carol raised her arms, which did interesting things to her breasts, and Joyce buckled a two inch wide brown leather dog collar around her neck.

�O.K.&nbsp; Get down on the floor.�

The beautiful woman did and started to assume the doggie position, but then heard the words she had expected and dreaded.

�No.&nbsp; You�ll suck him off first.&nbsp; That way he�ll last longer when he fucks you.�

Carol lowered her ass, turned and sat on her heels. 

As at the Fur Ball, people were all around her.&nbsp; From behind her the sound of a screen door opening and closing.&nbsp; Nails on floor.&nbsp; Silence.&nbsp;&nbsp; Footsteps.&nbsp; A man�s two; a dog�s four.&nbsp; A happy bark.&nbsp; Carol Edwards� body shook.&nbsp; She was facing the Blacks.&nbsp; She concentrated on the sharp crease in Mr. Black�s trousers.&nbsp; The dog was beside her.&nbsp; A tongue licked her bare shoulder.

�Down.�&nbsp; Buzz�s voice.&nbsp; �Here.&nbsp; On your side.�

Ransom understood.&nbsp; Ransom remembered.&nbsp; This felt good too.&nbsp; The big dog lay down on his side and without being told raised his left hind leg into the air.&nbsp; Several people gasped as huge penis burst from its sheath.

�Carol.�

She turned her head and upper body.

It was right there.&nbsp; Inches away.&nbsp; As red as her dress.&nbsp; But fleshy.&nbsp; Leaking.&nbsp; Angry looking.&nbsp; Tapering more to a point than a man�s.&nbsp; Oh God.&nbsp; I have to do this.&nbsp; I have to.&nbsp; She lowered her face.

When her lips were almost there, she froze.&nbsp; Unable to close the gap.&nbsp; To actually take that thing in her mouth.&nbsp; She knew she had to.&nbsp; But she couldn�t.&nbsp;&nbsp; Impatiently Ransom jerked his loins and solved the problem for her.&nbsp; Slippery tip found its way between lips,&nbsp; and with a muffled sob Carol Edwards forced her face down, taking as much she could in her mouth all at once, to get it over with.&nbsp; 

The taste, the texture were not like a man.&nbsp; Not like anything she had ever tasted.&nbsp; Perhaps raw meat.&nbsp; She did not know.&nbsp; She did not want to think about it.&nbsp; She had done it.&nbsp; She suppressed a gag.&nbsp; She was doing it.&nbsp; Sucking off a dog.&nbsp; In front of an audience.&nbsp; 

She began bobbing her head, using her tongue, trying to get it over with as quickly as possible, even though there would be seconds. 

The dog was panting.&nbsp; Carol did not know if she should try to stroke his balls.

�Pull your hair back so people can see.�

She did.

The room was silent except for Ransom whimpers of pleasure and Carol�s wet sucking.&nbsp; Ransom began to jerk.&nbsp; Carol felt his cock swell.&nbsp; What if it locked?&nbsp; A jet of bitter liquid spurted against the roof of her mouth.&nbsp; She swallowed.&nbsp; More and more, faster than she could swallow, ran between her lips, over her chin.&nbsp; Finally it stopped.

She raised her head into stunned silence.

�Lick it up.�

Ransom�s come had dribbled from her mouth onto his hard belly and the floor.&nbsp; Carol didn�t even hesitate.&nbsp; Nothing was too gross now.&nbsp; The dog growled when she started to lick his groin.&nbsp; Buzz yanked his leash and he stopped.&nbsp; Eyes moved over her body as she knelt,&nbsp; licking the floor after she had cleaned the dog.&nbsp; Eyes lingering on her ass, the slit of her cunt, her full dangling breasts, curve of hips, long legs, the definition of muscles in her back.

A woman�s awed voice:&nbsp; �I�ve never seen anything like it.�

A man�s:&nbsp; �Neither have I.�

She finished and raised her head.

�How long will it take him to be ready again?� asked Brad.

�Not long.&nbsp; A few minutes.&nbsp; He�s a dog of a dog.�&nbsp; Buzz laughed.

Carol was steeling herself for the next act, which she thought would be less disgusting, but more difficult to endure and probably painful.&nbsp; Being taken rather than taking.

�Stroke him.&nbsp; See if he is ready.�

He was.&nbsp; The red penis swelled and pulsed.

�Assume the position.�

She rolled over, onto her knees.&nbsp; �Good dog.�&nbsp; She didn�t know if Buzz was talked to Ransom or to her.

�Get your ass up higher.�

Carol turned her face to the left and pressed her right cheek against the floor and arched her back.&nbsp; She heard the Great Dane scramble to his feet.&nbsp; She forced herself to remain still as a nose sniffed, a tongue swiped.

�Keep your eyes open.�

She hadn�t realized she had squeezed them shut.

She was looking directly at Amanda Black, who was almost the age of her own mother.&nbsp; There was no expression on the woman�s face.

�Remain steady.&nbsp; Don�t move away or back.&nbsp; He�s done this before.&nbsp; He knows what to do.�

Paws beside her head.&nbsp; A heavy, furry weight on her back.&nbsp; Blind stabbing.&nbsp; Against her thigh.&nbsp; One cheek of her ass.&nbsp; Ransom growled in frustration.

�Reach back and guide him.�

Her hand stretched, fumbled, found spongy flesh, directed it between labia, and the dog triumphantly plunged in.

�Ohh.�&nbsp; 

It was big and long. It stretched her.&nbsp; Not bigger than a fist, but bigger than any man�s cock she had ever taken.&nbsp; 

Ransom had only one speed.&nbsp; Thousands of years of evolution said this is a vulnerable position, however pleasurable, so get your load in her before another male shows up.&nbsp; He fucked as fast as he could.&nbsp; His sleek black hips a blur.&nbsp; His cock thrusting as deep as it could to ensure that his sperm had a head start over any possible others.&nbsp; It bounced off places that had never before been touched.&nbsp; It hurt.&nbsp; Carol�s hands clenched.&nbsp; Then she felt something even worse.&nbsp; The knot.&nbsp; The dog�s cock was inflating inside her cunt like a ballon.&nbsp; Oh.&nbsp; God.&nbsp; No.&nbsp; It was ripping her apart.&nbsp; Yet as it did, it touched something good.&nbsp; At the very moment she felt the dog start to fill her with come, her eyes locked on Amanda Black�s.&nbsp; It was as though her own mother were watching her.&nbsp; �Arrggh.&nbsp; Fuck me you fucking dog.�&nbsp; And, against her will, Carol Edwards came.

But it wasn�t over.&nbsp; The handsome dog and the beautiful woman were locked together, just as in her disturbing memory, just as she knew they would be.&nbsp; 

Ransom tried to tug free.&nbsp; He was strong and dragged Carol a few inches backwards.

�No.&nbsp; Please.&nbsp; He�ll destroy me.�

�Steady, Ransom.&nbsp; Wait.&nbsp; You�ll both just have to wait.�

Minutes passed.&nbsp; People began to talk.&nbsp; Got up.&nbsp; Some left hurriedly.

In his struggles Ransom stepped over her.&nbsp; And there they were, asshole to asshole, facing in opposite directions.

Amanda Black and her husband stood.&nbsp; Amanda Black walked over and stood above where Carol and Ransom were both on all fours.
Carol turned her face upward.

�You are sick.&nbsp; I suppose I should feel sorry for you, but I don�t�

�

Knot eased.&nbsp; Ransom wrenched himself free, and trotted happily off beside Buzz.

People left, until only Brad and Joyce and Buzz, returned from taking Ransom to his kennel, remained.

Exhausted Carol was still lying on the floor.

Joyce Russell clipped a chain leash into the ring in her collar.

Carol looked at Brad questioningly.

�I�m leaving you here for a few days.�

�

Her kennel was at the far end of the row.&nbsp; The two next to her were kept empty so she would not disturb the other beasts.

Outside was a square of grass.&nbsp; Inside, which she reached by crawling through a Great Dane size hole, was a pallet and two bowls, one for water, one for food, and a litter box.

Most of the dogs were too big for Joyce to control, and Buzz had work to do with the avocados, so usually she was alone until evening, when he brought the males to her out on the grass.&nbsp; Two or three in succession.&nbsp; There was no discernible pattern as to whether he had her take them in her mouth or her cunt or her ass.&nbsp; Only whim.&nbsp; The ass hurt.&nbsp; When the dog was in her cunt, she usually came.

Joyce always watched.&nbsp; And sometimes during the day, she would bring one or two of the beagles into Carol�s kennel.&nbsp; They were too small to fuck a human, though they were eager to try, so Joyce had her suck them off.

On the third evening, or maybe it was the fourth, Carol had lost track of time, among other things, Buzz hooked the leash into her collar and led her from the kennel into the house.&nbsp; She was surprised and grateful that he let her walk upright rather than crawl.

There she was allowed a long shower, before being led to the Russell's� bedroom, where she spent the night, much of it on her knees, licking Joyce to orgasm while Buzz fucked her from behind.&nbsp; He, too, made her come.

They drove her home the next morning.&nbsp; 

They let her keep the collar, which she continued to wear for several weeks, until Brad told her to take it off.

The photographs shattered Ross Edwards� flimsy defenses.&nbsp; He thought he was beyond this, beyond her.&nbsp; Inflicting pain rather than receiving it.&nbsp; Mary liked it rough and kinky, so long as he didn�t leave marks her husband might find.&nbsp; But it was best when they didn�t want it, like that Australian.&nbsp; He could still hear her scream, feel the tightness, the power, as he shoved his cock up her ass.&nbsp; And there had been others, whom he had manipulated into situations where they had to take it and not tell.&nbsp; But these images tore all that away.

There was one, a close-up, not as extreme as the early one he at first had not recognized as her asshole, showing just her mouth, red lips stretched so wide they were turning bloodless white, around the hard dog cock.&nbsp; Ross could almost taste it, though he had no idea what a dog�s cock really tastes like.

And on her knees, her body completely hidden except for long tanned legs, beneath the black Great Dane.

And Carol and the dog back to back.

And others, many others, of Carol outside on a patch of grass with many other dogs, sometimes in the usual position, sometimes face to jowl, upturned soles of bare feet in the air separated by a furry back.

Two numbered consecutively were more close-ups.&nbsp; The first showed a dog cock buried in an asshole.&nbsp; The second Carol�s face twisted in agony, face crushing blades of grass.

The one that disturbed him most, along with the close-up of lips stretched around dog cock, was of her crouching submissively over the supine black Great Dane, licking what he assumed was dog come from the dog�s taut belly.&nbsp; Her tongue was extended, the pink tip touching a pool of milky fluid.&nbsp; One of her full breasts was partially flattened against the dog�s chest.&nbsp; Ross remembered those breasts and nipples dragging across his chest when they made love with her on top.

It was only mid-afternoon.&nbsp; He was in his office, but he wouldn�t work more that day.&nbsp; 

He took off his Rolex Submariner and took out his wallet, from which he extracted several hundred Singapore dollars and the guest card to the Kricket Klub; locked watch and wallet in his desk; considered if he had anything else identifying on his person; and went down to find a taxi.

�

The Kricket Klub was housed in an old British colonial mansion.&nbsp; 

Dark wood doors were opened for him by an attendant dressed in cricket whites and cap, holding a bat instead of a rifle.&nbsp; Inside an Asian man in a business suit sat behind a desk in a reception room.&nbsp; Ross presented the guest card.&nbsp; The man smiled.

�We are pleased to greet you, sir.

�To your left is the bar.&nbsp; The door to the right leads to the bathing area and sauna.&nbsp; Some prefer dry heat after Singapore�s humidity.&nbsp;&nbsp; The billiard room and private rooms are up the stairs.&nbsp; The dining room is on this level in the back, but unfortunately will not be open again until 7.

�We hope you find our facilities to your satisfaction.&nbsp; If you decide to become a member, I have the forms and can facilitate that procedure for you.� 

Ross went into the bar.&nbsp; Dark polished wood.&nbsp; Dim light.&nbsp; Long bar occupied at that time of day by only one other man.&nbsp; Singaporeans are hard workers and for most the work day was not over.&nbsp; A few empty tables.&nbsp; Booths, two of which were occupied by two men each, one pair sitting across from one another, the other pair side by side.&nbsp; Everyone looked up when he entered and then away.

Photographs on the walls of sportsmen, not insects as he had once surmised.&nbsp; Bats.&nbsp; Balls.&nbsp; The bartender in cricket gear.&nbsp; All the seated men in suits and ties.&nbsp; Two Europeans in one booth.&nbsp; The other three Asian.&nbsp; Ross took a seat at the bar.

�Welcome to the Sticky Wicket, sir.&nbsp; What may I prepare for you?�

�Gin and tonic.&nbsp; Plymouth if you have it.�

�We do, sir.�

Ross sipped his drink and looked at the photos and memorabilia on the walls.&nbsp; Photographs of individuals and teams presumably famed, but he knew little about the game.&nbsp; He had once attended one day of a test between South Africa and India in Mumbai, but that was purely business and no one paid much attention to what was happening, or it seemed not happening, on the grounds or pitch or whatever it was called.

�You are a visitor here?�

He hadn�t noticed the other man move to the stool next to his.

�Yes.&nbsp; To know that you must be a regular.�

Thick black hair, neatly parted, combed back from a high forehead.&nbsp; A high cheek-boned face.&nbsp; Thin lips.&nbsp; Even features.&nbsp; An expensive dark suit.&nbsp; Starched white shirt.&nbsp; Gold cuff links.&nbsp; Designer tie.&nbsp; A smile&nbsp; of slightly protruding white teeth.&nbsp; Chinese rather than Malay, Ross concluded.&nbsp; �Yes.&nbsp; Yes. I am.&nbsp; Quite regular.&nbsp; I�m Lee.�

After a brief hesitation.&nbsp; �Brad.�

�Pleased to meet you, Brad.&nbsp; Are you passing through or do you live in Singapore?�&nbsp; He held up a hand, palm toward Ross.&nbsp; �I don�t mean to pry.&nbsp; No need to answer if you wish not to.�

�I live here.�

�Ah.&nbsp; Good.&nbsp; And, if I may ask, what brings you to the Kricket Klub this afternoon?�

�An acquaintance gave me a guest card.&nbsp; I had some free time.&nbsp; Curious, I guess.�

�You know the nature of the club?�

�I...I believe so.�

�Then let me save us some time and come, as it were, right to the point.�

Ross felt a hand cup his balls and circle his cock through his suit trousers.

�As I thought,�&nbsp; Lee said, referring to Ross�s already hard cock.

Reflected in the mirror behind the bar he saw the two Europeans in the booth watching with amused expressions.

�Well, Brad, gentle or rough?�

Ross had trouble speaking.&nbsp; �Rough.�

Lee smiled.&nbsp; �That, too, is as I thought.�&nbsp; And squeezed.

�

�A little blood.&nbsp; You�ll be all right.&nbsp; You weren�t a virgin were you?�

Ross/Brad�s breath was ragged.&nbsp; �I�ve had things up there, but never a cock.�

�Well, well.&nbsp; You are tight, Brad old man.&nbsp; Surely you�ve sucked cock, haven�t you.�

�No.�

�Oh, this is my lucky day.�

�Release me.�

Ross Edwards was lying naked face down on a bed in one of the second floor private rooms.&nbsp; His hands were cuffed to a steel ring at the head of the bed, one of several conveniently placed around the room.&nbsp; His weight on his cock and balls trapped beneath him was less excruciating now that Lee was not pounding into him from above.

�Not, I think, until I enjoy your mouth.�

�At least release my cock.&nbsp; It�s going numb.�

�That I will do.&nbsp; Roll over.�

Turning onto his back was not easy and left his arms crossed, the handcuffs digging into his wrists.&nbsp; Ross raised his head. Lee had tied Ross�s necktie around his cock and balls.&nbsp; They were drum tight and purple with trapped blood.&nbsp; The way Carol�s breasts were in those photos when she was suspended by them.&nbsp; Fluid seeped from the tip of the purple cock.&nbsp; Lee flicked it with a fingernail.&nbsp; 

�No.&nbsp; Please.�

�Please what?�&nbsp; Lee asked.

�Please don�t.&nbsp; Please loosen my tie.�

Fingers slid down the tube of meat.&nbsp; Circled.&nbsp; Pumped a few times.&nbsp; Stopped.&nbsp; Moved lower.&nbsp; Cupped swollen scrotum and balls.&nbsp; 

�One more hard squeeze and I�ll remove the necktie.�

�Don�t.&nbsp; Please don�t.�

�One more.&nbsp; Ask me nicely or I�ll leave you like this and go see if anyone else wants some fresh meat.�

�No.&nbsp; All right.&nbsp; Squeeze my balls.&nbsp; Please.&nbsp; Argghh!�

The pain filled his body, exploded his brain.&nbsp; Is this what she felt?&nbsp; How could she stand it?

More pain as Ross, his head back on the mattress, staring up at the ceiling, felt fingers unwrap the necktie, and blood suddenly rush through unblocked arteries and veins.&nbsp; 

Then fingers around his cock, moving up and down, stroking, milking.&nbsp; In seconds Ross came as hard as he ever had in his life.

�My.&nbsp; My.&nbsp; You needed that, didn�t you?�&nbsp; Lee laughed, wiped his sticky hand on Ross�s belly, crawled up the bed, swung his left leg across and straddled Ross�s head.&nbsp; A sticky Chinese cock slapped Ross in the face.&nbsp; �And now I need this.�

�

Lee took a leisurely shower, dressed, examined himself in the mirror, before finally unlocking Ross�s handcuffs.&nbsp; �Let�s do this again, soon,�&nbsp; he smiled, and left.

�There is a hole in Los Angeles,� Brad said, words Carol Edwards would remember for the rest of her life.

�

Life returned to the abnormal which had become normal for Carol.&nbsp; Not just normal, essential.

Late one Sunday morning in February Brad drove them north along the coast in his black Corvette convertible with the top down.&nbsp; He seldom drove the car.&nbsp; Now that he could afford it he wasn&#8217;t even sure he liked it, but he had always wanted one as a teenager. 

Winter is the best season in Southern California, when the weather is so much better than in most of the rest of the county.&nbsp;&nbsp; The sun was shining and the temperature 80�.&nbsp;&nbsp; At one point they drove through the last holdout of agriculture from development, fields of cultivated flowers, cheerful rectangles of pure color, red, orange, yellow.

Brad had told Carol to dress normally and to stop wearing the dog collar.&nbsp; She had on a relatively modest peach colored dress, sleeveless, scoop neck, mid-thigh, with big wood buttons down the front.&nbsp; She did not think that �normally� extended to underwear, and so wore none.

He finally stopped for lunch at a seafood restaurant on the beach in Carlsbad, where they shared lobster and a bottle of Chablis.

Carol knew that there was more to the day than this, that some kind of degrading sex was ahead, and the lunch was pleasant.&nbsp; It was almost like a date.&nbsp; She was happy, until Brad said,&nbsp; �You know we are nearing the end?�

�Yes.&nbsp; But why?�

�I&#8217;m running out of ideas and time.�

�Time?&nbsp; For other women?�

�Yes.&nbsp; And business.&nbsp; These are hard times, and I&#8217;ve had to make changes.&nbsp; You haven&#8217;t fallen in love with me?� 

�No.&nbsp; Love would ruin it.&nbsp; Compromise.&nbsp; Weaken.�

�We are going to Ooni&#8217;s in a little while.&nbsp; He&#8217;s been pestering me for months to have you pierced.�

Brad took a jewelry box from his pocket and pushed it across the table toward her.&nbsp; They both realized at the same moment that it was the way a man would have offered an engagement ring.

She opened the box and found a helix of &#8539;� wide gold, spiraling through three complete circles.&nbsp; The ends of the helix were notched.&nbsp; There was also a gold cylinder the same length, with a small key hole.&nbsp; And a gold key.

Just then their waitress, an effervescent girl in her early twenties, returned and noticing the box, exclaimed, �Oh, you&#8217;ve received a gift.&nbsp; How lovely.&nbsp;&nbsp; And...unusual.�&nbsp; Her forehead creased, �But what is it?�

�A chastity device,�&nbsp; said Brad.

The girl turned as red as a field of flowers and hastened away.

�He wants rings in your nipples, too, but I said no.&nbsp; I did agree to one in your nose.�

Carol&#8217;s eyes widened.

�He convinced me with a striking photograph of a beautiful blond with one hanging down from her septum to below her upper lip.&nbsp; Eyes like yours looking directly into the camera.&nbsp; Bright red lipstick on a mouth like yours.&nbsp; She&#8217;d have to tilt the ring out of the way to give head.&nbsp; It would rub against the top of a cock.&nbsp; I&#8217;m curious to discover how that feels. You cannot look at the photo without imagining her being led by a chain through the loop.&nbsp; So barbaric it is erotic.

�That isn&#8217;t to be worn full time.&nbsp; At least not now.&nbsp; He will fill the hole with a spacer until it heals.&nbsp; No one will see.&nbsp; I&#8217;m told you&#8217;ll just feel as though you have a stuffy nose.

�He wants to marry you.�

�What?�

�Ooni wants to marry you.&nbsp; I think he loves you in his way.&nbsp;&nbsp; You&#8217;d be his slave as well as his wife.&nbsp; He&#8217;d still torture and abuse you.&nbsp; You&#8217;d get the sex you need.&nbsp; You could do worse.�

�Is that what you want?&nbsp; A way to get me off your hands?�

�I don&#8217;t want anything.�

�You&#8217;ve changed me.&nbsp; Made me need this.�

�I don&#8217;t know that I &#8216;made you need this.&#8217;&nbsp; I may have just opened a door.�

�I don&#8217;t want to marry Ooni, but I will if you tell me to.�

�I&#8217;m not going to do that.

�There is a hole in Los Angeles--and I&#8217;m not changing the subject by the way.&nbsp; It is in one of those high rises along Wilshire Boulevard between the La Brea Tar Pits and Beverly Hills.&nbsp; I&#8217;ve been considering our problem--and I accept that it is partially mine--and I&#8217;ve made some inquiries.&nbsp; One way or another I know a lot of people.

�Call it the rabbit hole that Alice fell through into Wonderland.&nbsp; Or a black hole with an event horizon from which nothing escapes.&nbsp; Or a wormhole in time and space.

�Whatever, it is a hole.&nbsp; Enter it and you vanish from this world and emerge in another.

�The hole is hidden in full view.&nbsp; It is entered through an elevator door on the lowest level of the building&#8217;s underground parking.&nbsp; I&#8217;ve seen it.&nbsp; There is ample parking on the upper levels so almost no one ever ventures down that far; but if they do, they see only an elevator door like any other, with a small plaque that states, �For private use only.�&nbsp; If they persist and press the call button, a recorded voice repeats the statement and directs them to public elevators on the next level.

�But if you are expected and recognized on the surveillance camera, the elevator door opens.&nbsp; The true event horizon is when the door closes.&nbsp; You are gone.

�I&#8217;ve been told that there are no floor buttons.&nbsp; No &#8216;open.&#8217;&nbsp; No &#8216;close.&#8217;&nbsp; The elevator has only one stop.&nbsp; The people I&#8217;ve spoken to don&#8217;t know on what floor.&nbsp; And not everyone enters the elevator willingly.&nbsp;&nbsp; Vans appear.&nbsp; Parcels are dropped off.&nbsp; In that case those who unload the parcel obviously exit the elevator before the doors close.&nbsp; It is a commercial enterprise.&nbsp; Like cars and paintings stolen on order.�

�And what happens when the elevator reaches its destination?�

�You are sold.&nbsp; By the pound.�

�What?�

�Lower your voice.&nbsp; They don&#8217;t sell slices.&nbsp; Just whole beasts.&nbsp; But the bidding is by the pound.&nbsp; I&#8217;m told potential buyers find it amusing.&nbsp; And those being sold realize they are meat.�

�Is that what you&#8217;re going to do:&nbsp; collect a finders fee?�

�No.�&nbsp; He laughed.&nbsp; �Though I suppose I could.�

�I don&#8217;t want to talk about this now.&nbsp; Let&#8217;s go to Ooni&#8217;s.�

�All right.&nbsp; But think about it.�

&#8232;----------

Ooni had been a pre-med student before he suddenly became a rich drummer and did the piercings himself, painlessly after administering local anesthetics and with surgical precision, assisted by a registered nurse.&nbsp; Pain, giving and receiving, was the essence of their mutual experience, but not that day.&nbsp;&nbsp; Ooni wanted the results to be perfect and, to some eyes, beautiful.

The procedures were perfumed on a tilting table on which Carol had often been tortured.&nbsp; Her septum with her head lowered.&nbsp; Her labia with the table level and her ankles secured to posts wide apart.&nbsp; Although her genitals were numb and she could feel nothing, she remembered being whipped while tied in that position.

Ooni did her labia first.&nbsp; He used an implement that cauterized the holes.&nbsp; Carol smelled burning meat.&nbsp; Herself.&nbsp; Meat.&nbsp; Being sold by the pound.

�

When he was finished with her nose, he freed her from the table and helped her stand.&nbsp; She felt a little woozy from the combined anesthetics.&nbsp;&nbsp; He gave her pain pills, two tubes of ointment, a page of written post-surgical instructions.

The nurse helped her dress.&nbsp; And Brad drove her home.

There was no sex, and yet back in her condo when sensation began to return and she felt the weight of the helix pulling at her lips, it was profoundly sexual knowing that she no longer had any control over her cunt.&nbsp; Brad had the only key.&nbsp; Idly she wondered if there was enough metal to set off airport security alarms.


38

Urine is sterile unless one has a kidney infection, which is a good thing.&nbsp; She had swallowed enough of it.&nbsp; But it burned as it flowed over cauterized holes, three in each labia minor, those on the right higher than those on the left.&nbsp; She quickly learned to pee slowly so it did not ricochet off metal.&nbsp; Urine could come out, but certainly nothing was going in.&nbsp; Her tampon days were over.

After patting herself dry, she walked naked into the bedroom, where she sat down on the carpet in front of the full length mirror, spread her knees and examined herself.&nbsp; Not even room for a finger, though she could peel back enough flesh to stroke her clit.&nbsp; She did.&nbsp; Slowly.&nbsp; Defiantly.&nbsp; The hell with them all, even if she needed them.&nbsp; This wasn&#8217;t enough.&nbsp; But it felt good.

She watched her reflection and tried to imagine what she would look like with the ring hanging from her nose.&nbsp; That and the helix.&nbsp; She knew she would be led around by them on a leash.&nbsp; Like an animal.&nbsp; A cow or an ox.&nbsp; She had lost--no, given away--control of her body months ago.&nbsp; But this was different.&nbsp; Solid.&nbsp; Real.&nbsp; Constant.&nbsp; &#8216;Barbaric.&#8217;&nbsp; Brad had said.&nbsp; It was.&nbsp; And erotic.&nbsp; She thought about being a slave.&nbsp; Truly helpless.&nbsp; Falling through a rabbit hole.&nbsp; No.&nbsp; It would not be into Wonderland.&nbsp; A black hole.&nbsp; 

While she continued to stroke her clit with her right forefinger, her left hand moved to her left breast.&nbsp; She squeezed the nipple.&nbsp; Hard.&nbsp; Shuddered with pain and pleasure.&nbsp; And came.


39

Ooni was a recluse.

Those few years of screaming Idolatrous crowds were enough to last a lifetime; and now he almost never left his isolated property, though he knew it would not be isolated much longer.&nbsp; The sounds of encroaching construction drifted over the eucalyptus trees.&nbsp; He owned several acres, but not enough if surrounded by subdivisions for the privacy he craved.&nbsp; Like mountain men of the Old West, the time when he would have to move higher into the hills was coming.&nbsp; But that presented problems.&nbsp; He was not totally self-contained.&nbsp; 

He needed Maria, his understanding housekeeper, to come once a week to clean and bring groceries.&nbsp; He needed to be in reach of FedEx and UPS to deliver Internet purchases.&nbsp;&nbsp; And he needed access to a supply of women who let him do sadistic things to their flesh for whatever reasons of mind or money.&nbsp; With most it was money.&nbsp; 

Twenty million people in two countries lived within two hours drive of his house.&nbsp; Ooni had the cell phone numbers of many men, and a few women, on both sides of the border who would provide him with female bodies to which he could do anything.&nbsp; Even kill.&nbsp; Ooni didn&#8217;t want to kill anyone.&nbsp; He simply wanted to make them suffer and fuck them while they did.&nbsp; But he had often been assured, without having asked for such assurance, that if a woman disappeared, she would not be missed.

Carol Edwards was different.&nbsp; Beyond the rest of them, though at least a few--himself, Brad, Faye--sensed that.&nbsp; Not just incomparably beautiful--and in his rock star days Ooni had moved in &#8216;A&#8217; list celebrity circles--and not just highly intelligent--though she was.&nbsp; There was something else.&nbsp; Something ineffable.&nbsp; Something untouchable.&nbsp; Perhaps several &#8216;things else&#8217; that he did not understand.&nbsp;&nbsp; Among them that she accepted willingly more than any whore did for money.&nbsp; To torture her, to watch her exquisite face as she suffered excruciating pain and humiliation, to look into her eyes at the moment she felt a dog spewing come into her cunt, was so much more than torturing lesser women.&nbsp; Was the greatest rush he had ever experienced.&nbsp; And to know that even as she begged and screamed--if she could--that when in a few days or weeks he summoned, she would willing return to experience it all again.

Ooni did not want Carol to disappear into the black hole--Brad had told him about it, along with her response to the suggestion of marriage--but he did not know what to do.

Immediately he did know what to do.

�Tilt your head back,� he said.

She did.

He looked up her nose.

�Good.&nbsp; You&#8217;ve healed perfectly.&nbsp; There&#8217;s always risk of infection.

�This will feel strange, but I don&#8217;t think it will hurt.�

Inserting a miniature forceps into one nostril, he caught the end of the surgical steel plug and eased it from her septum.&nbsp; Then he looked in again.

�Excellent.&nbsp; You can straighten up.

�I don&#8217;t know if you will be able to see.�&nbsp; 

He held a mirror beneath her nose.&nbsp; Eyes down, cross-eyed, she could.&nbsp; A hole.&nbsp; Quite a big one.&nbsp; A half inch above her nostrils.

�Sounds gross--that&#8217;s odd after the things we&#8217;ve done--but put your finger up there and feel it.&nbsp; You&#8217;ll have to do that to insert the ring by yourself.�

Carol did, and he was right, she was embarrassed to seem to be picking her nose.

�Head back.&nbsp; I&#8217;lll do it this time.�

The ring was 1�� in diameter and thicker than the helix spiral.&nbsp; 

Ooni showed her how one end screwed in and out of the other at an almost imperceptible seam.

He opened the ends, carefully inserted the ring into her nose, feed it though the hole in her septum, rotated until the ends were exposed, and screwed them back together.

�By the non-existent gods!�&nbsp; His voice was awed.&nbsp; �Look at yourself.�

Already she felt the strangeness.&nbsp; Pressing against the inside of her nostrils, partially blocking them, brushing her upper lip.&nbsp; She might have to breath through her mouth.&nbsp; And the thought came:&nbsp; what will I do when my mouth is full of cock or a gag?

She sat up and looked in the mirror and was stunned.

�Take off your dress, but keep the shoes on.�

Carol stood and unzipped.&nbsp; The little black dress fell.&nbsp; No matter how often he saw her naked, each time Ooni was struck anew by her beauty.

Taking a six foot strand of rawhide from his pocket, he tied one end through her nose ring, as she knew he would, as she wanted him to, and led her from the room.

He did not look back, but he did unpredictably tug on the rawhide, causing her to lurch and break stride.&nbsp; Her hands were free, but she was a captive beast.

He finally stopped in the room of mirrors.

Carol looked at her infinite reflections reflecting to infinity all around the room.&nbsp;&nbsp; Tall, full breasted--she had never previously considered being pierced, but now that she was, nipple rings might look good, too--narrow waist, flaring hips, long legs.&nbsp; Gold glittering cunt.&nbsp; Obscene gold ring through nose.

�Spread your feet.�

Ooni walked around behind her and pulled on the rawhide, bending her head back as far as it would go, bowing her neck, her eyes staring up at the ceiling.&nbsp; Then he passed it between the crack of her ass--she felt it on her asshole--between her legs, splitting her cunt. Changing hands, he moved in front of her, and tied the end violin string tight to the loop on the front of helix locking cylinder.

Carol was startled to realize that she was totally helpless.&nbsp; Able to stare only straight up, she could not see to move.&nbsp; There was no give in the rawhide.&nbsp; The ring was pulled up now and pressing into the bridge of her nose rather than hanging down.&nbsp; To try to raise her head pulled painfully on her cunt.

She felt a finger touch her mouth, trace her lips, move slowly down over exposed throat.&nbsp; Hand closed around neck.&nbsp; Tightened just enough to cut off breath.&nbsp; Released.&nbsp; Moved lower.&nbsp; Memorized suprasternal notch.&nbsp; Dropped to breasts.&nbsp; Gently caressed nipples.&nbsp; Carol could feel how hard they were.&nbsp; Hands were gone.&nbsp; Then one returned with a resounding slap that knocked her off her feet.&nbsp; Pain from nose and cunt, as well as reddening breast, as she involuntarily jerked and was brought to an abrupt halt&nbsp; by rawhide.&nbsp; Hands caught her before she hit the floor and lowered her onto her side.

Carol could more hear than see Ooni lie down beside her.&nbsp; She felt and tasted his cock as it was shoved into her mouth and down her throat.&nbsp; Easily at that angle.&nbsp; Every stroke caused her head to jerk.&nbsp; Every stroke brought pain to nose and cunt. 

When the familiar salty goo spewed into her mouth, her stretched neck made it difficult to swallow.&nbsp; She heard herself croak like a frog.&nbsp; 

Ooni fell away and lay on his back, staring up at the ceiling.&nbsp; He remembered what Brad had said.&nbsp; She was right.&nbsp; Love did comprise.

He got up and went to the bathroom, leaving her there tied nose to cunt.

Carol&#8217;s right eye was an inch above the hardwood floor.&nbsp; At the edge of her vision, an insect was crawling.&nbsp; She watched it until&nbsp; Ooni returned.

At 9:02 Monday morning, Rik Cronin�s puffy eyes opened wide.

�What�s this?&nbsp; Come here.&nbsp; Let me see.�

A naked Carol Edwards walked around his desk and stood with her bare legs brushing his clothed ones.&nbsp; Without being told, she spread hers apart.

�Another lock?�

Brad Tomalin had come by the condo just after her morning rounds.&nbsp; She found him waiting when she came out of the shower.&nbsp; Although it happened frequently, she was still startled to find someone unexpectedly in her home.&nbsp; He said, �Finish drying yourself.�&nbsp; Then he leaned back against the bathroom�s granite topped double basins--one for her; one for Ross had been the idea--and unzipped his suit pants.

She went to her knees and sucked him off.

After he came, he wiped his cock on a towel and took a heavy combination padlock from his pocket.

She looked at it curiously.

�Stand up.�

He reached down and passed the shackle through the ring on the helix, snapped it shut, spun the combination.&nbsp; When he let go, the pull of added weight was dramatic.&nbsp; A sensation of pressure, not pain though it could grow into that.&nbsp; Of labia being stretched.&nbsp; 

�From now on wear the nose ring when you�re at home.�&nbsp; And he turned and left.

The new lock swung when she walked.&nbsp; Pulled.&nbsp; Bounced against naked thighs.&nbsp; Caused her to walk differently.&nbsp; Feet wider apart.&nbsp; And to sit with them apart too.&nbsp; The lock resting on the chair.

�Obviously,� she said to Rik.

�Why?�

�You would have to ask Brad.&nbsp; I suppose to make me even more conscious of my locked cunt.�

Rik reached out and enclosed her with his hand.&nbsp; Lock.&nbsp; Cunt.&nbsp; All the flesh between her legs.&nbsp; And squeezed.&nbsp; Not hard.&nbsp; Just to get the feel.&nbsp; Metal pushing up against flesh.

�Hmm,� he said thoughtfully.

Releasing her, he stood.

�Turn around.�

Bending her over his desk, he forswore his nine o�clock head job and fucked her in the ass.&nbsp; Lock clanking against desk top.

...

 
The first thing she noticed when she got home that night was a two inch bronze square embedded in the hardwood floor between living and dining areas.&nbsp; Mentally she repeated Rik Cronin:&nbsp; �What�s this?� 

Knelling down, she saw the square had two parts.&nbsp; She lifted an edge and a pad eye rose 90�.&nbsp; A standard flush mount boat fitting.&nbsp; Brad would know boat fittings.&nbsp; She let go and the eye fell back into place.


41

�Go and get your tail,� he said, and they both laughed.

�Not a sentence I ever expected to hear or you to say.�

She would miss him, she thought, as she walked toward the bedrooms, and perhaps that was a kind of love.

He would miss her, he thought, as he watched her retreating naked back.&nbsp; No, he repeated to himself:&nbsp; he would really miss her.

Carol Edwards returned with the red butt plug on which she had smeared lubricant.

�Are you going to do it or shall I?�

�You.�

She stopped several feet from where he was sitting in the living room, turned, spread her feet, bent over as she had that first day in his office--a moment that remained vivid in both their minds--reached back with her left hand and separated her cheeks.&nbsp; 

The end of the tapered plug entered her well-used ass easily, but even with the lubricant the widest part stuck.&nbsp; She grimaced and pushed.&nbsp; It popped through.&nbsp; Her sphincter closed like a mouth as the plug narrowed at its base.

Cunt locked.&nbsp; Ass blocked.&nbsp; There was only her mouth.&nbsp; He filled that too.

�Come here.&nbsp; Kneel.&nbsp; Open.�

Brad took a black leather penis gag, pressed the life-like synthetic cock between her lips and fastened the buckle behind her head.&nbsp; Her eyes widened in momentary panic as she had the anticipated trouble breathing with the ring in her nose.

�Stay calm.&nbsp; Breathe slowly.&nbsp; I�m not going to let you suffocate.�

She could do nothing about her racing heart, but did consciously slow&nbsp; drawing air through her partially blocked nasal passages.&nbsp; It worked.&nbsp; There was enough oxygen.

Brad reached out and hooked his right forefinger in the nose ring and pulled her to her feet.&nbsp; He smiled.&nbsp; �This really is quite interesting.&nbsp; I�m glad Ooni showed me that photo.&nbsp; I would never have thought of it.&nbsp; Or at least not for a while.�

She had no choice but to follow him across the room, though she would have anyway.&nbsp; He stopped at the recessed pad eye.&nbsp; Tugged on the nose ring.&nbsp; She went to her knees.

�All the way down.&nbsp; Spread your knees.&nbsp; Sit back on your heels.&nbsp; Move forward.&nbsp; I want to see something.�

Brad sat down on the floor facing her.&nbsp; His legs outside hers.&nbsp; He reached between her legs for the combination lock, spun the cylinder right and left and right again.&nbsp; She heard the shackle click open.&nbsp; Felt his other hand doing something.&nbsp; Groaned as tender flesh was stretched close to tearing point.

�Almost there.�&nbsp; And the lock clicked shut.&nbsp; He straightened and sat&nbsp; back.

Carol�s view was blocked by her own body, but she knew she was locked by her cunt to the pad eye.&nbsp; Already there was pain.&nbsp; Distended labia.&nbsp; Knees, ankles, tops of her feet against unyielding hardwood.&nbsp; Her ass pressed white against her heels.&nbsp; And it would only become worse.&nbsp; She panicked. Lost control of her breathing.&nbsp; Brad�s hand on her shoulder.&nbsp; �Calm down.�&nbsp; Gradually she did.&nbsp; But the pain became worse.&nbsp; Her upper body was inclined forward.&nbsp; She could not sit upright.&nbsp; She could not move a fraction of an inch to ease the pressure.&nbsp; Tears came to her eyes.&nbsp; She stared at Brad watching her.&nbsp; Her tongue moved over the penis gag, trying too speak.&nbsp; Only unintelligible sounds.&nbsp; She reached out her hands, palms up.&nbsp; Beseeching.&nbsp; And when there was no response, slowly, tentatively, she slumped forward, causing a new pain as the butt plug shifted against some internal organ, until her breasts flattened against her knees and her head rested on the floor in abject agony and submission.

When after only a few minutes Brad released her, at first she could not stand.&nbsp; What will happen if I am left that way for very long?&nbsp; Crippled?&nbsp; I wanted to be truly helpless, and I certainly am.

While she was still crumpled on the floor, but on her side not her knees, Brad pulled the plug from her ass and removed the penis gag.&nbsp; Grateful breaths.

He poured Lagavulin into two heavy crystal glasses and set one on the floor beside her.&nbsp; In time she took a sip; but when she started to try to stand, he said, �No.&nbsp; Stay there.&nbsp; There is something else I want to try.�

�Please.�&nbsp; Pleading.

�I don�t think this will hurt.&nbsp; Finish your drink.�

Naturally graceful, he thought, as he watched her, her upper body braced by her left arm, right breast partially concealed by the arm with the glass, legs partially bent.

�Ooni might have been right about nipple rings,� he said.

�Yes.&nbsp; I�ve thought that.�

Glasses empty, he had her turn and lie face down on the floor&nbsp; Removing the combination lock from her cunt, he locked her nose to the pad eye.

�Can you get onto your knees.�

There was a little leeway with the nose ring, but not much.&nbsp; She tried. 

�No.�

�O.K.�&nbsp; He went around the room turning out the lights.&nbsp; �I�ll be back in the morning.� 


42

What�s this?&nbsp; Ross Edwards thought when he checked rossedwardswife.net at his desk.&nbsp; 

His beautiful soon-to-be-ex-wife was not in her usual doggie position, ass toward the door and the webcam.&nbsp; She was several feet to the left, all the way off the carpet, lying face down perpendicular to the camera on the hardwood floor mid-way between the living and dining areas.&nbsp; Her arms were free, elbows bent, palms flat on the floor near her head.&nbsp; He could see the bulge of her right breast pressed against the floor, the curve of her ass, the long lines of her legs.&nbsp; It was an odd position.&nbsp; There was something about her nose.

The sound of the door opening, voices, the tops of two men�s heads, then their backs moving away from the camera.

�What�s this?&nbsp; That�s not the way she was last time.�

�I told you, Brad�s locked her nose to the floor.�

�No.&nbsp; You didn�t.�

�Well, then I forgot.&nbsp; She can�t move.&nbsp; All you can do is fuck her in the ass.&nbsp; If you don�t want to, don�t.�

�Of course, I�ll fuck her ass.&nbsp; Greatest ass I ever fucked.&nbsp; I just didn�t know.&nbsp; Surprised.&nbsp; That�s all.�

�Sorry.&nbsp; I said I forgot.�

The men stood over Carol Edwards� supine form.

�Can you talk?�

�Yes.�

�But you can�t move?�

�Only a little.�

�Can�t get up on your knees?�

�No.�

They pulled chairs back from the dining table, sat, and began to undress.&nbsp; 

�How long are you going to be that way?�

�Until Brad releases me.&nbsp; Sometimes all night.�

�Do you get any sleep?�

�A little.&nbsp; Finally.&nbsp; But I wake if I move my head.�

�Tough.�

The men were both middle aged.&nbsp; Naked one had a once strong hairy body, whose muscles had softened.&nbsp; The other was flabby and always had been.&nbsp; Both had paunchy guts.

�Once muscled� was naked first.&nbsp; 

He sat on the backs of Carol Edwards thighs, pulled her cheeks apart, stared down.

�What do you expect to see there?&nbsp; A road sign?&nbsp; It�s her asshole.&nbsp; You shove your cock up it and pump up and down.&nbsp; You want a demonstration, I�ll go first.�

�Shut up.�&nbsp; 

The man spit on exposed asshole.&nbsp; Extended a thick finger and poked the spit in.

�Ohh.�

�Don�t pretend one finger�s a big deal.&nbsp; I�ve seen pictures.&nbsp; You�ve had a lot more than one finger up there.&nbsp; Dogs.&nbsp; Fists.�&nbsp; 

A resounding slap. 

�Ohh.�

Red hand mark.

Squat hairy body covered perfect naked body and began to rise and fall.&nbsp; From the camera angle Ross couldn�t see, but the man�s cock must have slid right in.

Thick body pounded harder.&nbsp; Carol�s head jerked.&nbsp; She cried with each thrust, crushing her into the floor.

The man reached out with his right hand and grabbed a fistful of blond hair.

�You like it, bitch?&nbsp; Tell me you like my cock up your ass?&nbsp; Tell me you want me to flood you with come?&nbsp; Tell me, or I�ll pull back hard on your hair.�

�Don�t do that, man.&nbsp; Brad said not to damage her.&nbsp; He�ll kill us.&nbsp; I mean maybe really kill us.�

Fingers released hair.&nbsp; �All right.&nbsp; Shit.�

�I&nbsp; love your cock up my ass.&nbsp; Flood me with come.&nbsp; Fuck me like the bitch I am.�


�

An hour later Ross Edwards was sitting at the Kricket Klub�s Sticky Wicket,&nbsp; He was a full member now, and smiled to himself at the double entendre.&nbsp; He was carefully nursing a martini, not wanting to be drunk, when a young man he had not seen at the club before&nbsp; came in and sat four stools away.&nbsp; Even in the dim light, the man�s skin was pale.&nbsp; Brad moved to the stool beside him.

�You haven�t been long in Singapore?�

�What?&nbsp; No.&nbsp; Sorry I didn�t see you.�&nbsp; With, as Ross expected, a British accent.

�No need to ask if you�re here on business, everyone in Singapore is on business.�

The bartender, Wei, a Chinese man of indeterminate age, put a gin and tonic in front of the man, who raised the glass, said, �Cheers�, and took a big gulp.

�Take another,� Ross said.

The young man did.

Ross extended his hand.&nbsp; �I�m Brad.�

A moment�s hesitation before,&nbsp; �Um, Tony.�

�Well, Tony, shall we get to the point?�

Ross let his hand drop to trousered thigh, which twitched at the touch, but did not move away.&nbsp; He slid the hand up.&nbsp; Tony glanced about the bar nervously.

�No one cares, Tony.&nbsp; That�s what this club is all about.&nbsp; You knew that.&nbsp; No one stumbles in here by accident.�

Fingers reached cloth covered balls, one traced up&nbsp; a hard bulge.&nbsp; Felt dampness through fabric.

�You didn�t just come?�&nbsp; asked Ross.

�No.&nbsp; Almost.&nbsp; Please.�

�Please, what?�

�Is there someplace we can go?&nbsp; Someplace private?�

�Indeed there is.�

�

The boy--he was in his twenties, but seemed younger naked--whimpered.&nbsp; Ross had arranged him face down on the bed.&nbsp; Hands tied to rings in the wall.&nbsp; A rope wrapped several times around his neck and tied to another ring, secured his head nose down.&nbsp; He couldn�t move without choking.&nbsp;&nbsp; Ass up.&nbsp; Legs straight.&nbsp; Ankles tied together.&nbsp; He had big, flat feet, rather than Carol�s high arched elegant ones.&nbsp; Tony was no Carol, but he would have to do.

Ross took the belt from his trousers and, holding it by the buckle, struck as hard as he could.

�Aggah!&nbsp; No.&nbsp; Please.&nbsp; You don�t have to be mean.&nbsp; I�ll do whatever you want.�

�I know you will.�&nbsp; As leather slashed white buttocks again and again.

When Tony was sobbing uncontrollably, Ross dropped the belt and climbed on.&nbsp; Red beaten ass was hot against his groin.&nbsp; He spread the cheeks and spit as the hairy man had a few hours ago on Carol, then without other preliminaries forced his cock in.&nbsp; Tony shrieked.

�Hurt?�

�Ye..yes.�

�It�s what you wanted,&nbsp; What you came here for.&nbsp; Say it.�

�It is,� the young man whimpered as Ross fucked him.&nbsp; �It is what I want.&nbsp; Make me your ass slut.�


43

�This one.�&nbsp; 

Brad and Carol were standing in the walk-in closet in her bedroom.&nbsp; He was wearing a tuxedo.&nbsp; She was naked except for body jewelry.&nbsp; He was pointing at a strapless floor length ivory sheath dress with a five inch wide rose colored band between bust and waist.&nbsp; 

He went back to the living room to wait while she dressed.&nbsp; It didn�t take long.&nbsp; High heels tapping in the hallway, then there she was.&nbsp; Breathtaking.&nbsp; Literally.&nbsp; Brad found himself involuntarily forgetting to exhale.

Shoulders.&nbsp; Arms.&nbsp; Throat.&nbsp; Bare.&nbsp; From just above her breasts, the dress closely followed the curves of her body.&nbsp;&nbsp; Large&nbsp; breasts and small waist accentuated by the rose band.&nbsp; Long legs by the long fall of material to an inch above the floor.&nbsp; Only the tip of matching ivory shoes.&nbsp; Perfectly respectable.&nbsp; Perfectly sensationall.&nbsp; She could have been going to an Inauguration Ball.

�You want me to leave the nose ring in, don�t you?�

He had not said anything about this.&nbsp; As always she was perceptive.&nbsp; 

�Yes.�

Well, perhaps not an Inauguration Ball after all.

They rode the elevator down.

He was driving the Lexis tonight, and turned down the hill toward the city skyline.&nbsp; She had not asked where they were going, but when he took the approach to the Coronado Bay Bridge, she knew.

On the highest arc of the bridge she was looking down on sails far below on the harbor; then ahead at Coronado and in the far distance, the Coronado Islands fifteen miles offshore in Mexican waters.

Coronado itself is almost an island connected to the mainland only by a fortunate sand spit that runs to just above the Mexican border and makes San Diego a great natural harbor.&nbsp; By far the biggest building ahead and below them was the white painted, red-roofed Hotel Del Coronado, a sprawling Victorian beach resort, built in wood in 1888, and a celebrity in its own right, appearing in many films, including SOME LIKE IT HOT.

The most elegant of the Hotel del Coronado�s many dining room is The Crown Room, with a high intricately wood paneled domed ceiling from which are suspended crown-shaped light fixtures.&nbsp; Persistent legend says that the future abdicating King Edward VIII first met the divorcee Wallis Simpson there in 1920, although both of them deny that.

Carol Edwards had been the cynosure of all eyes everywhere she went for twenty years.&nbsp; With her looks, in that dress, and with a ring through her nose, this was the dawn of a whole new era.

The valet who opened the car door for Carol was struck mute and motionless.

As they walked into and across the lobby, it was as though a tsunami had passed.

People respond to self-confidence.&nbsp; Although everyone has doubts and fears, and many people are dominated by them, some have learned to control and hide them and present only an assured front to the world.&nbsp; Dig deep enough into Brad Tomalin and you would eventually find the bewildered little son of a poor farmer.&nbsp; Brad Tomalin would not deny his existence; but he had left that boy far behind.&nbsp; His life had not been transformed by chance.&nbsp; He was truly and justifiably confident.&nbsp; That was one of the qualities, perhaps the essential quality that had attracted Carol Edwards to him.&nbsp; He did not ask.&nbsp; He acted, not impulsively, but decisively, and he was accustomed to being obeyed.&nbsp; So when the distinguished maitre� d at the Crown Room took a startled glance at Carol Edwards, he started to say something but was saved by years of experience.&nbsp; Before he spoke he looked at Brad Tomalin and didn�t.&nbsp; 

When Mrs. Black made the dinner reservation, she had specified a table at the center of the room.&nbsp; Deferentially, as the room fell silent, Carol and Brad were shown to their table and wishes for their enjoyment of the meal and the evening expressed.

Their waiter had time to compose himself, and managed to act as though nothing was out of the ordinary.&nbsp; He did have some difficulty in finding a place to fix his gaze.&nbsp; If he looked Carol Edwards in the face, his eyes inevitably fixed on her nose ring.&nbsp; To look lower was to stare at her breasts.&nbsp; He tried to fix his eyes on her eyes, which were indeed lovely and worth looking into.

Brad and Carol acted as though they were nothing more than an exceptionally attractive couple having dinner in a fine restaurant.&nbsp; They ate, they drank wine, they chatted.&nbsp; Though both were aware that in a room of heavy startched linen, cyrstal, Wedgwood, flickering candles, they were the subject of hushed conversations and several unsuccessfully sureptititous photographs with cell phones.

How can she look so untouched by all the things she has willingly done and had done to her?&nbsp; Brad wondered.&nbsp; Covered in come.&nbsp; Sodomized by men, women, fists, dogs.&nbsp; LIcking come from floors.&nbsp; Swallowing piss.&nbsp; Licking countless hairy assholes.&nbsp; Screaming.&nbsp; Begging.&nbsp; A year ago she had been with seven men and no women, now she�s been used by hundreds.&nbsp; Day after day.&nbsp; More than almost any whore.&nbsp; It must have changed her.&nbsp; And yet the wonder of it was that, except for the nose ring, there was no outward sign.&nbsp; He did not understand.

Over dessert, Carol said, �I take it that I am to wear this all the time from now on.�

�Yes.&nbsp; This was your coming out party.&nbsp; You�ll attract so much attention, you might start a fad.�

He raised his glass of forty year old armagnac in a toast.&#8232;&#8232;�To the confusion of our enemies.�

She clicked glasses with him.

�And who are our enemies?�

He thought only a moment.

�Everyone who never recognized your true worth.�&nbsp;

This is what it must be like to be a rock star, Carol Edwards thought as she walked from her office to Brad�s.&nbsp; No wonder Ooni has become a recluse.&nbsp; 

She walked because Brad told her to walk.

She had been to Brad�s office so often, that she began to recognize people on the elevator.&nbsp; Three young women stepped on just before the door closed in the lobby.&nbsp; Carol had already pushed �31.�&nbsp; One of them hit �25�.&nbsp; For a few floors they all remained silent, but then one of the women said,&nbsp; �You don�t work in this building, do you?�

�No.�

�Making outcalls?�

Carol smiled, �Something like that.�

�That was come on your face that day, wasn�t it?�

�Yes.�

Staring directly at Carol�s nose ring, �Anything else pierced?�

�Yes.�

The door opened for the 25th floor.&nbsp; The other two women stepped out, but the one lingered, reached into her purse, took out a business card and hurriedly pressed it into Carol�s hand, �Call me.&nbsp; Please.�&nbsp; before leaving too.

31st Floor.&nbsp; Mrs. Black looked up from her desk.&nbsp; �Very becoming.&nbsp;&nbsp; Go right in.�

�One more thing,� he said; but she knew he was really saying, �One last thing.�&nbsp; �Where�s your father�s office?�

�

Dr. James--never �Jim�, not even to Elaine, his wife of almost thirty-five years--Litchfield finished his second cup of coffee while watching the news on CNN, kissed Elaine routinely goodbye, and, after reminding her that he had a late operation and would not be home until at least 9:00, left ostensibly for his Newport Beach office.&nbsp; However, he turned the Mercedes south onto the coastal highway instead of north, drove two miles, turned inland for five blocks, and parked in a visitor space at a four unit townhouse.&nbsp; Selecting one of the many keys on his keyring, he unlocked the front door of an end unit, passed through a living room and entered a darkened bedroom in which a sleeping form was outlined beneath rumbled covers.

�Hmm.&nbsp; I was hoping you�d stop by.�

Dr. Litchfield sat on the edge of the bed while he undressed, then rolled under the covers and encountered soft, warm flesh.&nbsp; His already hard cock bumped pleasantly against a curved surface.&nbsp; She was on her side, facing away from him.&nbsp; He reached around and cupped a full breast.&nbsp; A nipple became erect beneath his fingers.

�That�s nice.�

He pushed the sheet and bedspread down.

Sunlight through closed curtains dimly illuminated narrow waist, flare of hips, long legs.&nbsp; He couldn�t see her face, but he knew that it was beautiful.&nbsp; Almost as beautiful as his daughter, Carol, who was coming by his office later that morning; almost the same age; almost the same lush body.&nbsp; Dr. James Litchfield knew that it was not coincidence that most of the young women with whom over the years he�d had affairs resembled Carol, who had twenty years ago disturbingly become the most beautiful girl, the most desirable female, he had ever seen.

His right hand withdrew from right breast, lightly traced a line down and back, over ass, between legs and into a wet crack.

Two fingers moved slowly in and out.&nbsp; Wetness increased.&nbsp; One explored until it found clitoris.&nbsp; Naked shoulders moved.&nbsp; Breathing became louder.

�You know I�m ready.&nbsp; What are you waiting for?�

He withdrew his hand.&nbsp; Lifted one cheek, thrust his hips forward.&nbsp; His cock knew the way and easily entered.

�I love your cock.&nbsp; It is just the right size.�

The words became moans as he moved with a slow, gradually increasing pace, his groin touching then moving away, then touching her again.&nbsp; His hand reaching around again and enclosed a breast.&nbsp; Lovely anonymous back, hips, legs.&nbsp; This could be Carol.&nbsp; This must be Ross sees.&nbsp; What other lucky men had seen.&nbsp; He often wondered how many.&nbsp; He didn�t think the number was large.&nbsp; Elaine told him that she hadn�t asked for birth control pills until she went to Stanford.&nbsp; She hadn�t dated many boys before she met Ross.&nbsp; He had never known what she saw in him.&nbsp; Ross was decent enough looking in a corporate sort of way, but not even close to being her equal in looks or brains.&nbsp; 

�Ohh.�&nbsp; Plaintively as he withdrew and rolled the form onto her back.&nbsp; Knees came up and separated.&nbsp; Was it the oldest position?&nbsp; If so, it was still beautiful.&nbsp; A woman opening herself, becoming so vulnerable.&nbsp; He wanted to see her face.&nbsp; He slid back in.

Her eyes were open looking up into his, then as he moved in and out, closed with pleasure.&nbsp;&nbsp; In his mind the face was transformed, became Carol�s.&nbsp; James Litchfield did not know if other father�s had such fantasies about their daughters; but then other father�s did not have such a daughter.&nbsp; And he knew the difference between imagination and action.&nbsp; He never had and never would actually do anything about it.&nbsp; Yet he liked to believe he was watching Carol�s face contorted with lust; her face he was watching as she came.&nbsp; And sometimes her lips wrapped around his cock as he filled her mouth with come.

He moved faster, harder.&nbsp; Bodies slapping together.&nbsp; �Oh, God.&nbsp; Oh, God. Oh, God.�&nbsp; they chanted together, and with a rush came together.&nbsp; And afterwards lay for a few minutes panting together.&nbsp; 

�That was nice.�

�Nice?�

�You know what I mean.&nbsp; I�m so glad you stopped by this morning.�

He got up and went into the bathroom to take his second shower of the morning.

She was still in the bed when he returned and started to get dressed.

�You�re working this afternoon?�

�Yes.&nbsp; When�s your surgery scheduled?�

�5:00.�

�Hip replacement?�

�Yes.�

�I�ll see you at the hospital then.�

Diane von Furstenberg is credited with popularizing the wrap dress, and Carol Edwards, n�e Litchfield, was wearing an original that looked like a fragment of a Mondrian painting.&nbsp; Horizontal and vertical black lines formed rectangles and squares of varying sizes on a white background.&nbsp; Randomly two of the rectangles were red; two blue; and one small square was yellow.&nbsp; Of a knitted jersey fabric, it clung rather than fell to mid-thigh and had close fitting long sleeves to her wrists.&nbsp; Matched by three inch stilettos, each half white, half black, had her body not been like those on the cover of the Sports Illustrated swim suit issue, Carol Edwards could have stepped from the cover of VOGUE. 

She wore no jewelry, visible or otherwise.&nbsp; No nose ring; no helix.

We survive as a species not because we are intelligent--one has only to look at our political leaders and so-called economic systems to know that we aren�t.&nbsp; We survive because we are aggressive, like to reproduce, will eat almost anything, have a great capacity to endure suffering, and are adaptable.&nbsp; This last might be thought a sign of intelligence, but usually is just a matter of short memory. 

Carol hadn�t been pierced that long, but already she had become accustomed to her cunt being closed, and to have the lips open felt strange.&nbsp; Once in Brad�s new car, she had reached below her dress and separated them.&nbsp; She was wet and the air made them tingle.&nbsp; She was always wet.&nbsp; She could almost feel her father�s cock there, and wondered if she soon would.&nbsp; The great thing about a wrap dress is how easily it unwraps.&nbsp; Her�s by a single hidden hook.

Brad Tomalin had sold the Corvette.&nbsp; He�d fulfilled that boy-hood fantasy and there was no reason to keep a car he really didn�t like and that did not suit the man he liked to think he had made himself.&nbsp; He and Carol were sitting in its replacement, a 525 horsepower Audi R8, in the parking lot next to her father�s Newport Beach office.&nbsp; Sons of poor farmers in the Imperial Valley did not dream of Audi R8s.&nbsp; Probably none had ever even heard of them.&nbsp; More distance between his present and his past.&nbsp; The car was custom painted burgundy.&nbsp;&nbsp; The dealer had tried to sell him one in the standard �Brilliant Red�, which was really Ferrari red.&nbsp; He told the man that If he had wanted a Ferrari, he would have bought a Ferrari. 

Brad was holding a Blackberry in his hand.&nbsp; The email was composed.

�What floor is your father�s office on?�

�Fifth.�

�I�ll send it five minutes after you go through the door.&nbsp; Don�t want him to see it early.�

They both felt the excitement of risking the unknown.

�All right.�&nbsp; And she opened the door.

Brad admiringly watched her walk across the lot to the entrance of the steel and glass building.&nbsp; She might be gone a few minutes; she might be gone much longer.&nbsp; It was an experiment.

 
�

�Wow!&nbsp; You look even more spectacular than usual.&nbsp; What a fantastic dress!�&nbsp; The enthusiasm came from Monica, her father�s receptionist, a pretty blond about her own age.&nbsp; �Where did you get it?�

�A gift.&nbsp; I think it came from Neiman�s.�

�Truly original and stunning.�&nbsp; Then speaking into the intercom, �Dr. Litchfield, Carol is here.�

Office doors had become portals to sex.&nbsp;&nbsp; Rik�s.&nbsp; Brad�s.&nbsp; The despicable Dr. Sedwick.&nbsp; Many, many others.&nbsp; And now her father�s.

He stood and came around his desk as she entered.

He is an attractive man, Carol thought.&nbsp; Not just for his age, but seriously attractive.&nbsp; Tall, slim, fit.&nbsp; He made regular use of the swimming pool and tennis court at home and took pride in weighing exactly what he had in med school, and having the same size waist.
 Age had made few inroads.&nbsp; His hair was finally thinning and graying, and his mustache was almost white; but the face was still chiseled, the jaw firm, and his manner that of a confident surgeon.

He met her halfway for a paternal hug, which unexpectedly and disconcertingly became something else, when Carol threw her arms around him and plastered her body against his, breasts flattening against chest, pubis against cock, which she felt stir, thigh against thigh.&nbsp; And lingered, while planting a long, wet kiss on his cheek.

Unaccustomedly flustered, her father finally broke away.&nbsp; �Well!&nbsp; Such enthusiasm.&nbsp; Are you all right?�

�Never better, Daddy.�

He leaned back against his desk, and she sat in a patient�s chair opposite, noticing that his eyes involuntarily darted to her thighs as she crossed her legs and let her dress ride higher.

�A lovely dress.&nbsp; It�s new?�

�Yes.&nbsp; A gift.�

�From Ross?&nbsp; Is he back?�

�We�re divorced.�

�What?&nbsp; When?�

�It was final a month ago.�

He started to speak, but she interrupted.

�No need to worry.&nbsp; It was as painless as these things ever can be.&nbsp; And probably inevitable.&nbsp; Once he went to Singapore, our lives drifted apart.�

�Still��

�No, really.&nbsp; Ross is history.&nbsp; We have some indirect contact.&nbsp; He looks in on me from time to time.�

�Looks in?&nbsp; Is he back in San Diego then?�

�No.&nbsp; Check your email.&nbsp; I�ll show you.�

Moving back around his desk, her father said, �I don�t understand.�

Carol followed him, and leaned over his shoulder while he sat and opened the lid of his laptop.&nbsp; He was very aware of her breast resting on his shoulder.

�There,� she said.&nbsp; �The top one.�

�The new me?� he questioned, reading the subject line.

�Well.&nbsp; Maybe new.&nbsp; Maybe always the old me.&nbsp; Whatever.&nbsp;&nbsp; Click on that link first.�&nbsp; Pointing at www.rossedwardswife.net.�

�I thought you said you are divorced.�

�We are.&nbsp; It was set up while we were married.&nbsp;&nbsp; No need to change.�

�Is that your living room?�

�It�s a live feed.&nbsp; 24-7.&nbsp; That�s how Ross looks in on me.&nbsp; At least he did.&nbsp; I expect he still does.&nbsp; You should too.&nbsp; It�s best at 8:30 p.m.�

�Best?�

Her belly and pussy contracted.&nbsp; This was the irreversible moment.

�Click the other link and you�ll see.�

Dr. James Litchfield did and saw the photo that had traumatized Ross Edwards a year earlier:&nbsp; a man in an expensive suit in an office chair, much like his own, smiling into the camera.&nbsp; The back of a naked woman on her knees between tasseled shiny black shoes.&nbsp; Her head buried in the man�s lap.&nbsp; Her face was not visible.&nbsp; But Dr. Litchfield knew who it must be.&nbsp; He wasn�t traumatized; but he was shocked.

There were other pictures on the page.&nbsp; And his daughter�s face was visible in many of them.&nbsp; Everything was visible.&nbsp; Everything he had imagined.&nbsp; And far, far more.&nbsp; Far, far worse.

She was surrounded by men.&nbsp; Cocks in every hole.&nbsp; Her face lust crazed.&nbsp; Glazed in come.&nbsp; Men.&nbsp; Women.&nbsp; Dildos.&nbsp; Fists.&nbsp; There she was knelling with her mouth open to a stream of piss.&nbsp; There her face buried in a fat ass.&nbsp; There her head in a toilet.

He sensed motion beside him, and glanced up.&nbsp; Carol�s dress gaped open.&nbsp; There were those perfect breasts.&nbsp; She was cupping them with her hands.&nbsp; Offering dark nipples to him.&nbsp; His eyes moved down.&nbsp; She was shaved.

�You know you want it, Daddy.&nbsp; You want to do to me what all those other men have done.&nbsp; You can.&nbsp; It�s just a cock in a cunt.&nbsp; I want you to.�&nbsp; 

She fell to her knees and unzipped his pants, freed his throbbing hard cock from underwear.&nbsp; �See.&nbsp; Your cock doesn�t care who I am.&nbsp; Go ahead look at the rest.&nbsp; There�s more.�&nbsp; And she lowered her warm mouth.&nbsp; Her full, red lips stretched around him, just as he had fantasized a few hours earlier.&nbsp; And, sliding up and down, felt so good.

He turned his head back to the computer.&nbsp; She was in a mirrored room.&nbsp; Tied at full stretch,&nbsp; arms pulled toward the ceiling, toes inches off the floor.&nbsp; The long black line of a whip wound around her body.&nbsp; She was on the floor, her flesh crisscrossed with angry red stripes, sucking on a plastic tube that ran from her anus.

Fists in both her ass and cunt simultaneously.&nbsp; A look on her face of agony or ecstasy.&nbsp; Or both.&nbsp; In her living room floor surrounded by half a dozen black ghetto kids standing masturbating on her.&nbsp;&nbsp; Her own wrist disappearing into her cunt.&nbsp; Her ass.&nbsp; Suspended in the air by purple breasts that looked about to burst.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pushing a needle through her nipple.&nbsp; Kneeling with a long tail trailing from her ass.&nbsp; �Not a dog,� he croaked.&nbsp; Then, �Dogs.�&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, �Licking up dog come!�&nbsp; The warm, wet, sucking mouth moved faster.&nbsp; �What�s this?�&nbsp; A gold spiral in her labia.&nbsp; �A ring in your nose!�&nbsp; Ah, God!&nbsp; He was about to come.&nbsp; To come in his daughter�s mouth.&nbsp; As he had imagined doing for twenty years.&nbsp; But it was wrong.&nbsp; �No!&nbsp; No!�&nbsp; He pushed her away just as semen exploded from his purple engorged cock.&nbsp; She fell onto her back, raised and opened her legs, reached down and spread her cunt.&nbsp; Red, glistening, flowing with juices, ready.&nbsp; 

He hadn�t come this hard for years.&nbsp; Sperm arched out and fell onto her body, some landing on her open cunt.

�You know you want to fuck me, Daddy.&nbsp; You can.&nbsp; Anyway you want.&nbsp; Any hole.&nbsp; Every hole.&nbsp; My mouth.&nbsp; My cunt.&nbsp; My ass.&nbsp; I�m a slut.&nbsp; I want you to.�

Reaching down with an elegant hand, she rubbed his come into her cunt, then raised red-nailed fingers to her mouth and sucked on them.&nbsp; �Hmm.&nbsp; You taste good.�

Dr. Litchfield fell back in his chair.&nbsp;&nbsp; Small spurts of come were still shooting from his cock, running down it, onto his underwear and trousers.&nbsp; �You�ve gone mad.&nbsp; You�re insane.&nbsp; What has happened to you?&nbsp; You need help.�

Carol got back onto her knees and crawled toward him.&nbsp; Tantalizing dark nippled breasts swaying.&nbsp; �I can help you, Daddy.&nbsp; Get you hard again.&nbsp; So you can fuck me.�

�No!&nbsp; No!&nbsp; Absolutely not.�&nbsp; He fumbled with his cock, pushed it back, managed to close his zipper.

�Really, Daddy?�&nbsp; Carol got to her feet, held the sides of the wrap dress open wide.&nbsp; �You really don�t want this?&nbsp; Everyone else does.&nbsp; Everyone else has.&nbsp; You�ve seen the photos.&nbsp; Or watch the live feed from my living room.&nbsp; Maybe you�ll change your mind.�

And she closed the dress, fastened the catch, and walked from her father�s office, from her father�s presence, for the last time.


�

Carol�s mother was easier.&nbsp; Although afterwards they both agreed that she had not been as drunk as she seemed.

As they approached the house on a hilltop, it seemed to be floating on water.&nbsp;&nbsp; A single story of wood and glass almost completely surrounded by an amorphous moat, which when he was inside, Brad saw blended into the distant ocean.

�A beautiful house,� he said as they were getting out of the Audi.&nbsp; �You designed it?�

Carol smiled her gratitude.&nbsp; �Yes.&nbsp; How did you know?�

�Something about it is you, has your style.&nbsp; Sensual elegance.�

�I didn�t do houses professionally.&nbsp; Hospitals.&nbsp; Research centers.&nbsp; Corporate headquarters.&nbsp; This was an assignment at Stanford.&nbsp; When my parents saw the drawings, they liked it so much, they tore down the house I grew up in--California ranch--and built it.�

She had told him what happened in her father�s office on the short drive to the house.&nbsp; She was still flushed with sex and energy.

�Mother?�&nbsp; she called a bit too loudly.

�You�re early.&nbsp; I�m back here, by the pool.�

A door opened and closed.&nbsp; They met halfway, and Carol gave her mother a full body hug almost as suggestive as she had given her father.&nbsp; 

When they broke apart, she said, �Mother, this is Brad.&nbsp; Brad, my mother, Elaine.�

Her mother was perplexed, but did not let that interfere with good manners.

�Let�s go back out to the patio.&nbsp; It�s too early for lunch.&nbsp; We can go out to eat, or I have things here.�

�Early for a drink, too,� added Carol.&nbsp; �We brought some wine, but let�s make a pitcher of margaritas to take out with us.�

The flag-stone patio, like the water surrounding the house, had a form of irregular curves, contrasting with the linear house and the over size swimming pool.&nbsp; A tennis court stood beyond it.

When they were seated, first round of margaritas poured, Elaine Litchfield said, �Are you all right?&nbsp; You seem, forgive me for saying this, but almost high.�

�I�m fine.&nbsp; Fine.&nbsp; Not high.&nbsp; Just excited to see Daddy and you.�

Elaine Litchfield was wearing a long yellow and white sundress, sleeveless, scoop neck, with buttons down the front, and flat sandals.&nbsp; As she and Carol chatted, Brad observed her.&nbsp; She must be in her late fifties and was a good looking woman.&nbsp; A golden tan.&nbsp; Fingernails and toenails painted coral pink.&nbsp; Good ankles.&nbsp; Carol�s fine bones.&nbsp; Considering her husband�s profession, she�d probably had some surgery, at least a face lift, but if so, it was the best.

�And you, Brad?�

�What?&nbsp; I�m sorry.&nbsp; I didn�t want to intrude on your and Carol�s conversation and wasn�t following.�

�Ross and I are divorced, Mother.&nbsp; It�s not what you think.� 

�Divorced?&nbsp; Why didn�t you tell us?�

�I just did.�

Pleasantries, inconsequential conversation, and margaritas flowed. 

Brad listened poured, and sipped.&nbsp; Carol and Elaine chatted and drank. 

Elaine Litchfield�s words began to slur just as the sun reached the patio.

�It�s going to get too hot out here,� said Carol.&nbsp; �Let�s go inside.�

They moved to the living room.&nbsp; Elaine Litchfield and Carol arm in arm.&nbsp; Brad holding the door for them, then following.&nbsp; 

The room was spacious.&nbsp; The furnishings modern. 

The women ended up sitting together on one part of a beige sectional.&nbsp; Brad on the other part at a right angle to them.
Carol�s hand reached out and touched her mother�s shoulder, then slid beneath her hair.&nbsp; Both of them were now expensively natural appearing blondes.&nbsp; Carol�s a lightening of light brown; Elaine�s covering encroaching gray.&nbsp; Fingers caressed the nape of neck.&nbsp; Affectionately.&nbsp; Seductively.

Elaine Litchfield�s eyes closed.&nbsp; �That feels good.&nbsp; You are a dear.�

�You seem tense, Mother.�

A second hand followed and massaged, caressed.&nbsp; Then moved around to the front.&nbsp; A finger lightly traced cheek, forehead, over closed eye-lids, beside nose, to mouth.&nbsp; Outlined lips.&nbsp; Chin,&nbsp; Throat.&nbsp; Collarbone.&nbsp; Undid a button.&nbsp; And as it moved lower, Carol Edwards leaned over and kissed her mother on the mouth.&nbsp; Lightly at first.&nbsp; Lips just brushing lips.&nbsp; Then lips pressed harder against lips, as fingers slid inside a bra and found a nipple.

Eyes opened.&nbsp; Head pulled back.&nbsp; �What are you doing to me?�

�Making you feel good.&nbsp; It does feel good, doesn�t it?�&nbsp; 

Fingers continued to caress a hardening nipple.

�Yes.&nbsp; But��&nbsp; Elaine Litchfield�s eyes settled on Brad Tomalin.

�Brad doesn�t mind.&nbsp; He�s seen women make love before.&nbsp; He�s seen me make love with women.&nbsp; No, he�s seen me have sex with women.�

Fingers which had caressed, now enclosed breast and squeezed more firmly.&nbsp; Elaine Litchfield�s sigh ended in her daughter�s open mouth.&nbsp; Tongues touched.&nbsp; Carol�s left hand behind her mother�s head forced them together.&nbsp; Her right left her mother�s breast, quickly reached down, pulled up her dress, and rubbed through green lace panties.

�Oh.&nbsp;&nbsp; OH.&nbsp; OH!�&nbsp; Elaine panted with the strokes.

When she was certain of her mother�s arousal, Carol stopped. 

�No.&nbsp; Don�t stop.�

�I can make it even better.�

Buttons undone.&nbsp; Dresses pulled off.&nbsp; Green bra and panties flung aside.

Elaine Litchfield found herself on her back naked.&nbsp;&nbsp; A beautiful hot naked body on top of her.&nbsp; Full length.&nbsp; Soft breast against soft breast.&nbsp; Legs mingled.&nbsp; Hands in hair.&nbsp; Lips kissing.

Carol�s head moved down.&nbsp; She sucked her mother�s nipples.&nbsp; The wicked thought came that she must have done this thirty-three years ago.&nbsp; She wondered what her mother felt then.&nbsp; Lower.&nbsp; Hands parted thighs.&nbsp; A surprise.&nbsp; Her mother was partially shaven.&nbsp; Hair above, but none on the sides or the crack of her ass.&nbsp; Good for mother.&nbsp; Carol pulled labia wide apart.&nbsp; It did not seem possible that she had entered this world through that shiny red tunnel.&nbsp; And now that she was about to leave it, she returned.&nbsp; She buried her face.&nbsp; Buried her tongue.&nbsp; Savored.&nbsp; As she had savored the other part of the equation:&nbsp; her father�s come.&nbsp; 

Her mother began to convulse.&nbsp; �Oh God.&nbsp; Oh God.&nbsp; That feels so good.&nbsp; Soo...god...damn...good!�

And Carol Edwards, n�e Litchfield, discovered after all these years that her mother was a squirter.

When her mother had calmed, Carol stood and taking her by the arms, helped her move, dazed from sex and, perhaps, drink, from the sectional to the carpeted floor.&nbsp; 

Carol sat on her mother�s breasts, feeling them against her ass.

�Now, me,�&nbsp; she said, raising her hips and lowering them on her mother�s face.

From the sectional, Brad Tomalin watched.&nbsp; He did not recall that he had ever seen a mother and daughter have sex.&nbsp; It was quite a sight.&nbsp; Particularly these two.&nbsp; The daughter incomparable, but the mother desirable too.&nbsp; Smaller breasts, but still a doable body.

He stood and took his cock out and walked over and put it in Carol�s face.&nbsp; Without a word, her mouth opened and took him in.&nbsp; He let her suck for a while, then withdrew.&nbsp; He did not want her distracted when her mother made her come.&nbsp; He watched her face.&nbsp; Blue eyes locked on his, and, unaware of her hands clenched in her mother�s hair, she gave him her shuttering orgasm.

The moment Carol toppled slowly to one side, Brad knelt and shoved his cock into Elaine Litchfield�s gasping mouth.&nbsp; Deep.&nbsp; She gagged.&nbsp; He pulled out just far enough for her to take a breath, then shoved in again.&nbsp; Fucked her mouth.&nbsp; In.&nbsp; Out.&nbsp; In.&nbsp; Out.&nbsp; Pulled out.&nbsp; Spun around, pulled her legs apart.&nbsp; Cock slid easily into flooded cunt.&nbsp; Her bare feet above his shoulders, pushed back near her ears until she was almost bent double.&nbsp; Fully dressed except for his cock, his weight on the tips of his shoes and his knuckles, he fucked her as hard and as fast as he could.&nbsp; Her eyes, also blue, stared up in shock and amazement and drooling desire.&nbsp; She came so convulsively she almost threw him off.&nbsp; He continuing fucking.&nbsp; And when she felt him start to fill her with come, she came again.

They left her that way, sprawled naked on the living room floor, her daughter�s juices drying on her face, a stranger�s come oozing from her cunt into a puddle on the carpet.&nbsp; 

It was fortunate that Dr. Litchfield had a late surgery that day.

�

�What�s that music?�&nbsp; Carol asked as they drove south.

�Arvo P�rt.&nbsp; An Estonian.&nbsp; �Spiegle im Spiegle�.&nbsp; Translated as �mirror in mirrors.��

The room at Ooni�s, she thought.&nbsp; �It�s beautiful.&nbsp; Where did you learn about music?�

�Like everything else, I taught myself.�

As the gentle notes from piano and violin filled the car, she remembered Thomas Wolfe�s posthumous novel, YOU CAN�T GO HOME AGAIN.

He had no idea.

At 8:25 that evening Carol Edwards, naked except for nose ring and gold helix, stood facing directly into the webcam for a few moments before assuming her customary position, head down, arms
outstretched, palms flat, knees apart, ass and cunt toward the door, which soon opened.

�Well if it isn�t our favorite pig slut.�

Laughter.

She did not have to look up.&nbsp; She recognized the voice.&nbsp; There would be four of them, among the crudest Brad let use her.&nbsp; She should have known.

They would make her dance and put on a show for them.&nbsp; They would slap her around.&nbsp;&nbsp; Watch her crawl and beg for it.&nbsp; Fists as well as cocks would be far up her ass.&nbsp; Spit on her face.&nbsp; And her tongue would spend much of the evening in assholes.&nbsp; One of their favorite routines was to put her on her back, one fucking her ass, one sitting on her face after throat fucking her, the man in her ass eventually moving to her throat and face,&nbsp; while another fucked her ass, in a seemingly endless round robin.&nbsp; 

And she would drink piss. 

They didn�t even bother to go back to one of the bathrooms any more, but pissed on her there, making her lick from the hardwood floor any she failed to swallow directly.

A hand cracked against her ass.&nbsp; Another lifted her head by the hair.&nbsp; A finger from a third hooked the nose ring.

�Glad to see us, piggy?�

�She not a pig.&nbsp; She�s a bitch.&nbsp; Remember?&nbsp; Even sluts have principles.&nbsp; She doesn�t do pigs.&nbsp; She only fucks and sucks dogs.&nbsp; At least I don�t think she does pigs.&nbsp; Have you ever had sex with a pig?&nbsp; Other than us, of course?�

They all laughed.

Carol Edwards wondered if her father was watching.&nbsp; Ross didn�t even cross her mind.


47

�Pick up the phone, Carol.&nbsp; I can see you.&nbsp; I know you are there.�

�If you can see me, then you can hear me.&nbsp; What do you want?�

It was 6:30 p.m.&nbsp; She was sitting naked on the sofa, drinking a martini.&nbsp; The voice over the answering machine was her father�s.&nbsp; There was a slight time lag.

�I�m coming down there Saturday.�

She laughed.&nbsp; �To fuck me?&nbsp; Last night�s performance must have excited you enough to change your mind.�&nbsp; She spread her legs and put one foot up on the sofa.&nbsp; �How do you like my jewelry?&nbsp; Unfortunately as you can see, you missed your chance at my cunt.�

�I did see part of last night.&nbsp; Not in real time.&nbsp; I was still in surgery.&nbsp; I set my computer to record.&nbsp; I saw enough.

�And I�m not coming to have sex with you.&nbsp; I�m bringing a colleague I want you to talk to.�

�Let me guess:&nbsp; a psychiatrist?�

Breath audibly exhaled.&nbsp; �Yes.�

�Don�t waste your time.&nbsp; I won�t be here.�

�Carol, please.&nbsp; This is for your own good.�

�Sorry, Daddy.&nbsp; I have other plans.�


�

A speed dial number touched.

�Hello.�

�I�m ready.&nbsp; Do it.&nbsp; Now.&nbsp; As soon as possible.&nbsp; Before the weekend.�

The cock in her mouth swelled.&nbsp; Carol Edwards liked having a cock in her mouth.&nbsp; During the past year she had become a connoisseur,&nbsp; like an oenophile who can from a single sip identify the vineyard, vintage, and, legendarily, even the slope on which the original grapes grew.

She liked the fullness of a cock, the shape, the texture, the salty taste, although often the cocks that entered her mouth carried the flavor of her own ass or cunt or both.&nbsp; She liked the smell.&nbsp; She liked having her flesh penetrated by other flesh.&nbsp; She liked the back and forth motion.&nbsp; She liked the animal aggression when a man forced his cock down her throat.&nbsp; She liked moving her tongue over pulsing veins and arteries..&nbsp; She liked the differing tastes of come.&nbsp; But most of all she liked this moment when an already hard cock hardened just that bit more, engorged as semen flowed from balls.

Her cheeks hollowed as she sucked and fluttered her tongue.&nbsp; The fingers of her right hand stroked balls.&nbsp; She forced her head forward, burying her nose in crinkly public hair.&nbsp; Cock fully engulfed.&nbsp; And there it was:&nbsp; the first explosive spurt.&nbsp; She swallowed Vern&#8217;s thick come and listened to him groan.&nbsp; When she was sure he was finished, she raised her head and let his cock plop from her lips.

She looked up at him and smiled.&nbsp; He looked down at her dazed. 

Holding the red, wet, glistening cock in one hand, she carefully licked it clean, even opening the tip and sucking out the last hidden drop, causing Vern to groan again.

Almost all of those who used Carol Edwards had other sex partners as well; but as far as she knew Vern did not.&nbsp;&nbsp; Getting to her feet, the thought came to her that Vern might not ever have sex with a woman again unless he paid for it; and somehow she did not see him doing that.&nbsp;&nbsp; Beyond an orgasm Vern wanted the illusion that someone cared for him.&nbsp; It was a sad thought.&nbsp; He wasn&#8217;t that much older than she.&nbsp; Decades of glancing surreptitiously and shyly at the students in his physics classes.&nbsp; Decades of masturbating, fantasizing about them, remembering her.&nbsp; She leaned over and kissed him tenderly on the cheek instead of playfully on the top of his bald head as usual.&nbsp; His eyes widened with pleased surprise.

She pulled on her dress, slipped into her shoes, and left.

...


Making the decision was like closing a door behind her.&nbsp; Her last decision.&nbsp; Ever.&nbsp; Or so she believed.&nbsp; Carol Edwards was completely,&nbsp; preternaturally calm.&nbsp; There had been momentary shock when she had asked what she should wear, and Brad had replied that he didn&#8217;t think it mattered; and she realized that of course it didn&#8217;t matter because whatever she wore would be taken from her and what she wore, or didn&#8217;t wear, would henceforth be decided by someone else.&nbsp; A small thing, but it caused her, briefly, to wonder what else about the loss of freedom she hadn&#8217;t considered.

Finished with her last morning rounds, she showered, and thought, but with detachment:&nbsp; when I next bathe will be decided by someone else.

She brushed her teeth and put the brush back in the holder, although she realized she didn&#8217;t need to.

She watched herself distantly in the mirror, brushing her hair, applying red lipstick, having to raise the nose ring with her left hand to do so with her right.

From her closet she took the trench coat she had worn to that first gangbang at Brad&#8217;s house near Julian and slipped into the same black backless sandals, whose high heels clipped/clopped down the hardwood hallway.

In the kitchen she tore the top sheet from a pad on which she made grocery lists, wrote a few words, and left it on the dark green granite counter top.

From her wrist she removed the Cartier Santos watch her parents had given her when she graduated from Stanford and placed it on top of the sheet of paper.&nbsp; She was beyond time.

She walked out onto the balcony and stood, looking down at San Diego Bay.&nbsp; A sailboat was sailing slowly.&nbsp; She watched it for a minute, took a deep breath--eucalyptus trees, mown grass--turned and left the condo without looking back, closing the door only because Brad had told her too.

The elevator took her to the parking level.&nbsp; She knew that the next elevator would take her farther.

Ross&#8217;s Land Rover was still in its space.&nbsp; He had said he would come back for his possessions, but hadn&#8217;t yet.

She climbed into her cheerful yellow Beetle and drove down the hill to Mission Beach, where she turned left and followed Mission Boulevard&nbsp;&nbsp; to its south end where there is a small public parking lot near the jetty.

Brad&#8217;s silver Lexis was already there.&nbsp; She pulled into the space beside it, turned off the engine, got out of her car, locked the door--Brad wanted it to be found not stolen--and quickly stepped into the Lexis, tying not to glance across the beach to the ocean.&nbsp; She had lived all her life near the Pacific Ocean whose clear horizon had always seemed to offer endless possibility.&nbsp; She could not face that; but for a few seconds she could not avoid the sound of surf.
&nbsp; 
�

Ten thousand cars on Interstate 5, rushing north and south, business, pleasure, make a deal, see a client, visit relatives, go to Disneyland, entering, exiting:&nbsp; the freeway as life.

A silver Lexis moved with the flow.&nbsp; Inside two people.&nbsp; A man.&nbsp; A woman.&nbsp; Silent.&nbsp; Distant.&nbsp; Only a few words had been spoken.&nbsp; �What music would you like?�&nbsp; �I&#8217;ve made my last decision.�&nbsp; So it was Bach&#8217;s �Inventions and Sinfonias� played by Tatiana Nikolayeva on the piano.&nbsp; Carol had kicked off her shoes and was remembering the sensation of sand beneath the soles of her bare feet.
...

It was just after noon when they merged from the Santa Anna Freeway onto the Santa Monica.&nbsp; At La Brea Brad exited.&nbsp; 

�Are you hungry?&nbsp; Do you want to stop for lunch?�

�No.�

He drove north to Wilshire, turned left, and after a few blocks pulled into the parking entrance of a fifteen story office building.&nbsp; Their eyes took a moment to adjust to the transition from bright sunlight to the artificially lit darkness of a man-made cave.

Brad followed the signs and painted arrows, gradually descending.&nbsp; 

On each level there were fewer parked cars.&nbsp; Level 4 was almost empty.&nbsp; Level 5 was empty.&nbsp; Clean concrete.&nbsp; Walls.&nbsp; Ceiling.&nbsp; Pavement seldom driven on.&nbsp; No tire marks.&nbsp; No oil smears.&nbsp; No discarded candy wrappers or ticket stubs.&nbsp; In the far wall a single elevator door.

Although he could have pulled up beside it, Brad Tomalin swung wide and stopped twenty feet away.&nbsp; When he switched off the engine, the silence was complete.

�You don&#8217;t have to do this.�

�I know.�

Brad reached into his pocket and came out with a gold chain on which dangled a gold key.&nbsp; Turning toward her he leaned forward and dropped it over her head.&nbsp; �If you do go, you&#8217;ll need this.�

Carol Edwards sat motionless, facing forward, not looking at him; but Brad noticed that her feet were slipping into her shoes.&nbsp; She seemed serene.&nbsp; His own pulse was pounding.&nbsp; He felt the blood throbbing in his temple.&nbsp; The moment stretched.&nbsp; Neither of them moved.&nbsp; It lengthened.&nbsp; Finally he could not endure it.&nbsp; 

�I&#8217;m going to drive away.�

�No!�

�Then what?�

�It should have been the second level.�

�What?�

�Dante&#8217;s INFERNO.&nbsp; The second circle of hell is lust.&nbsp; The fifth is anger.&nbsp; I&#8217;m not angry.&nbsp; The elevator should be on the second level.�

Still staring forward, still not looking at him.&nbsp; �Tell me to go.�

�I can&#8217;t.�

�TELL ME TO GO!�

�GO.�

In one fluid motion Carol Edwards slipped from her trench coat and the Lexis and her life.&nbsp; Halfway to the elevator she kicked off her shoes.&nbsp; She didn&#8217;t have to press the call button.&nbsp; As she neared, the elevator doors silently opened.&nbsp; Brad Tomalin watched her perfect&nbsp; naked form step unhesitatingly in.&nbsp; She did not turn around.&nbsp; His eyes fixed on the cleft of her ass.&nbsp; The door closed.&nbsp; 

He exhaled.&nbsp; Adrenaline was rushing to his brain.&nbsp; His hand shook as he started the car.&nbsp; His foot jerked against the accelerator.&nbsp; In unexpected panic, he who prided himself on always being in control, fled.&nbsp; Tires squealed.&nbsp; Circled upward.&nbsp; Back toward the light.&nbsp; Retreated.&nbsp; Were lost in distance.&nbsp;&nbsp; 

Seventy-five feet below Wilshire Boulevard, the fifth level of a parking garage was silent.&nbsp; Hollow.&nbsp; Empty.&nbsp; Except for a pair of black high heeled sandals toppled onto their sides.

Although she knew it was unlocked and she had often entered before without seeking permission, Faye sensed that something was wrong and knocked on the door.&nbsp; No one had seen Carol Edwards for four days.&nbsp; Not in person or on the webcam.&nbsp; Two of those days were on the weekend when she was often away; but she had now twice missed her morning rounds .&nbsp;&nbsp; Faye waited, and when there was no response, knocked again louder.&nbsp; Then waited again before turning the knob.

�Carol?&nbsp; Are you home?�

The living room was empty.&nbsp; The doors to the balcony open.&nbsp; Curtains&nbsp; swayed in a light breeze coming up from the bay.

She crossed to the kitchen, blunt jaw clenching when she saw the Cartier wristwatch on the granite counter.&nbsp; She read the words on the sheet of paper without moving it.

�CAROL?�&nbsp; She called as she forced herself down the corridor, afraid of what she would find.&nbsp; 

The guest bathroom was first.&nbsp; She entered and pulled back the shower curtain.&nbsp; Relief that it was empty.

Nothing in the guest bedroom.

�Carol?�&nbsp; again as she entered the master bedroom.&nbsp; No one in the bed or on the floor.&nbsp; She had expected it would be the master bathroom; but at a glance, it wasn&#8217;t.

Retracing her steps, she returned to the kitchen.&nbsp; Read the words on sheet of paper again.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Gone to another world &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

And dialed 911.

Brad Tomalin had good lawyers, good connections--several of the men and women who had used Carol Edwards held elective office--and no motive.&nbsp;&nbsp; The time of her disappearance was never precisely established so he needed no alibi.&nbsp; Her VW convertible was found.&nbsp; Surfers who daily ride the jetty break were questioned.&nbsp; They recalled seeing the car parked there, but could not recall when it first appeared.&nbsp; Shown a photograph of Carol Edwards, they, and everyone else to whom her photo was shown, said they had not seen her, and if they had, they would have remembered that face.

Although no body ever washed ashore, eventually the legal system decided that Carol Edwards had committed suicide.&nbsp; Only Brad Tomalin knew that it was an assisted suicide.&nbsp; She had died intestate.&nbsp; 

Ross Edwards flew back from Singapore and hired a law firm to argue that he should have a portion of the estate.&nbsp; His claim was denied and he ended with nothing except the Land Rover and a few other personal possessions.

After the condo was sold and various IRAs and 401ks were transferred, Dr. and Mrs. Litchfield ended up with slightly more than a half million dollars they did not need.&nbsp; They donated the money in her name to the Salk Institute, whose research is worthwhile and whose Louis Kahn designed buildings Carol had caused her to decide to become an architect.&nbsp; They kept only the Cartier Santos watch, which Elaine Litchfield intended to wear in memory of her daughter; but found that she could not because each time she glanced at the watch she relived Carol&#8217;s last visit.&nbsp; She felt her daughter&#8217;s lips on hers, breasts against her breasts, the taste of Carol on her face, the building orgasm from Carol&#8217;s tongue.&nbsp; And then being fucked senseless by that man.&nbsp; It was too much.&nbsp; She put the watch in a drawer and tried, unsuccessfully, to forget. 

Only one other relic remained of Carol Edwards&#8217;s life.

Brad Tomalin kept her trench coat.&nbsp; He knew there was danger in doing so, but was confident that he could, if ever necessary, explain it away. 
 
The coat hung in his walk-in bedroom closet.&nbsp; Whenever he noticed it, he wondered.
