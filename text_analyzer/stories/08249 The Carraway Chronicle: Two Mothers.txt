Synopsis: Nick reports on a conversation between two dommy mommies.






Dear Reader, I am confronted daily by the severity of the changing times. This periodical has long been vocal on the issue of Y chromosome degeneration- a belief that many intellectuals and journalists (including this author) hold- and the dangers of allowing our young men to be scientifically, genetically altered by the misandric agenda. While this belief is still incredibly controversial (many simply refuse to acknowledge obvious evidence), this periodical has found another, possibly greater threat. 
I am sure that the immediately following is well understood by most, but for those just now acknowledging the truth, it is worth stating again. With the mastery of scientific progress in areas such as alternative conception and genetic manipulation, a combination of natural behavioral choices, already shifting demographics, economic disruption and the prominence of several feminist intellectuals, have drastically deceased the prevalence and visibility of men worldwide. This shift in social paradigm is now having a new, even more horrific effect. 
Recently I was visiting the capitol of our great nation in the swamplands of D.C. and had the uncertain pleasure of overhearing a conversation between two young mothers. From what I gathered, both were mothers of young boys, the mothers between the ages of thirty and thirty five and the boys aged ten. They had last met at a parenting seminar before the birth of their children, and had talked only occasionally since then. Both were also what I call �Helicopter Parents� or �Pageant Moms,� those beautiful young women who feel unfulfilled by their accomplishments and want to redeem themselves through their more perfect children. 
One said, �How has the chastity training been coming? I remember Sandra saying how crucial it was to start before puberty.� It may come as a surprise to some readers of this journal, but lifelong chastity is the sad condition of many many men. 
The other replied, �I started it when he was only five or so. One day I came home from work to find him rubbing himself against a tree like a ridiculous little puppy. Of course, I was absolutely disgusted, him treating that tree like it was some kind of Babylonian whore, like I know he wanted to treat all women. You know, right up until that moment, I couldn�t be sure if she was right saying that all men want to do is to rape and dominate. But when I saw his perversion beginning as a baby, well, I was just horrified. So, he is already used to chastity. He gets restless, but doesn�
t seem to know why. Although he has been presenting much better lately.� 
�Presenting?� the other mom asked, resituating her coat, lingering over the buttons in just too heavy and slow a gesture. �What do you mean, presenting?� 
�Oh, you haven�t heard that term? That�
s when they automatically get into the position you train them to wait in. I picked the penitent dog for Sam, with his ass in the air and his arms folded under his chest. Did you not train Brice to do that?� 
�Oh,� the first replied with a little giggle, �not really. Is it important?� 
�Well,� the second one said, leaning in over the table in a secretive, somehow seductive pose, �Metropole Magazine says that in the next five years, all higher-level government and business officials will require their men to present effectively. It�
s going to be all the rage. You have to own them inside and out.� 
Now, the conversation up to this point, depending on your exposure to the harshness of the real world, may seem fairly familiar. Here is where things began to shock me. 
The first one, apparently not wanting to be outdone by her friend and rival, said with a confidential giggle, �Actually, I�
ve started a more drastic training regimen for my little boy. I think it will really pay off for him in the long run.� 
�What is it?� the other asked, drawn in. 
�Well, I�
ve become a convert to the Shell of Venus, that sect that all those celebrities have been touting lately.� 
�You don�
t say.� 
�Well, I had my reservations, but it made sense to me. This is the new world. It has its excesses and issues, but how can we really blame ourselves. We only want what is best for our boys. So, I�
ve kept a very close eye on mine and started strap-on training.� 
�No,� said the second, not altogether shocked. 
�Yes. I have to say, he is so much better behaved after I get his boy spunk to dribble through the grate of his chastity belt. He had a little trouble coping at first, but now he practically begs for it. I guess that because he has never experienced a full orgasm, getting his prostate rubbed feels almost as good as our clits.� 
�But how can you do that to your own flesh?� 
�Well, it seems to me that it would almost be more cruel not to. Someday he will go out into the world where I can�t protect him anymore. Once I sell him, I sell him, and I recognize the fact that the world has some good people, and many bad ones, and for every kind girl who will make love to his cunt, there will be four who want to hurt him and rip it apart. So, I figure that if I can train him to take it and possibly enjoy it, we will all be better for the experience. Besides, it feels great to make love to your son. You can explore off of those feelings and emotions of that angsty stage. Nothing convinces a man that he has no will is to take his virginity and constantly reminding him of his place. I am just so glad that I chose this instead of milking while taking off the chastity belt. To be honest, I don�
t even think I have his key anymore, not that anyone will need it. I never have to deal with his disgusting appendage now that I can just push the spunk out of him with my ten-inch dildo.� 
The first mother was somewhat surprised. �Ten inches. That�
s quite a bit for a four-and-a-half foot boy. How does his asshole take it?� 
�Well, it�s actually the dildo that I got as my high school graduation present. I was pretty little then, so it�s only about three inches in diameter. It just feels right to pound him with it. It�s pretty enjoyable for me too. I�ve just recently started having him lick up my cunt because it�s usually soaked after a few minutes of pounding his tiny hips into the floor or watching him bounce up and down on it while I yank him around by the leather sleeve I keep his arms in behind his back. I almost just can�t help it now. I let him ride it whenever he wants because it�s just so hot to watch him struggle for my attention. I honestly don�
t think he gets any sexual gratification at all, he just wants to make me happy, which honestly makes me so happy.� 
Dear Reader, I am horrified by this conversation and fear that these practices and attitudes are so widespread in our culture today. Please, pick up next month�
s issue, where I will further explore this issue. The conversation continues.
