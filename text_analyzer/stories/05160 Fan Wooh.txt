The character of, Fu Manchu was the creation of novelist Sax Rohmer in the
early 20th century. He was an average, peaceable, Chinese&nbsp;
until his family was wantonly and needlessly murdered during the Boxer
Rebellion of 1900.&nbsp; He became the embodiment of the evil oriental genius
engaging in the most terrible crimes against humanity imaginable, and
unspeakable tortures.

This is a tale involving another inscrutable arch fiend, Fan Wooh.&nbsp; He has a fanatical hatred of ALL people,
inspired by a betrayed childhood and debauched criminal parents.&nbsp; But he
soon tired of the criminal aspects of what was now&nbsp; HIS
empire.&nbsp; He discovered that murder, mayhem, drug dealing and such held
little attraction for him..

He was obsessed with torture. He had witnessed the horrific torture of some of
his kinsmen's enemies, and he&nbsp; became obsessed
with it.&nbsp; He now lived for the inflicting of the most diabolical and
savage tortures upon all races and cultures, but particularly those of the
female gender.&nbsp; The horrific and continuous screams of women under vile
and barbarous tortures aroused him to&nbsp; heights of
ecstasy.

Some of his machinations and his descent further and further into this
debauched and monstrous craft are described in this narrative.&nbsp; His
fiendish and merciless methods will be described in explicit detail.

If vivid descriptions of vicious and inhuman tortures bother
you. If uneven grammar or misspelling at times, (spell-check and proof
reading doesn't always get 'em all) offends or
mitigates enjoyment, further reading is not recommended.&nbsp; However if you
enjoy the screaming of horribly tormented and tortured beings, (especially the
feminine ones), and descriptions of the tortures and reactions of the victims,,,,,,,WELCOME!!!

By dint of this being fiction, liberty will be taken at times to place Fan Wooh in previous eras in order to use a setting in the dark
past, present, or anywhere in-between. When doing so it is to be assumed his
background matches present day circumstances, of being raised and being part of
a&nbsp; band of scoundrels, dealing in drugs, contraband and any number of
nefarious, illegitimate pursuits, the primary and most favored being torture
for tortures sake.

To begin, the setting is&nbsp; mid 20th century China. 

To further his own interests, (torture), he allied himself with the followers
of Chairman Mao.&nbsp; Being a firm believer in the use of whatever means
expedient to obtain his own ends, Mao was the ideal associate.&nbsp; There were
always hordes of those unwilling to bow to the dictates of the all knowing and
benevolent Chairman.&nbsp; Anyone voicing the slightest reluctance to accept
his teachings as true, and therefore law, was suspect. Untold thousands, nay&nbsp; millions of unfortunates died screaming in his
torture chambers as he attempted to extract information he and his followers
suspected they may or may not have. No matter.&nbsp; Or in untold numbers,
revenge for real or imagined slights or rejections of attention. 

As the preeminent practitioner of his grisly craft Fan Woo is a valued member
of Mao's entourage.&nbsp; It is acknowledged that anyone turned over to Fan Wooh will reveal whatever information is desired.

Even with his own dungeons fully occupied with females awaiting his heinous
enjoyment, he would immediately turn his talents to those under suspicion by
the powers that be.

We find Fan Wooh in one of the many chambers devoted
exclusively for use by the official powers, in questioning the accused.&nbsp;
They are located in an ancient castle, now referred to as&nbsp;
&quot;The Palace of Eternal Truth&quot;..&nbsp; 

His own torture chambers are located in the sub cellars beneath one of his
numerous fortresses. The screams of his victims are for his enjoyment alone. 

The interrogation chambers where he questions the regimes guests are located
where the screams of those under interrogation are readily heard by
outsiders.&nbsp; It is believed hearing the hideous screams of those inside
will act as a restraint, on anyone hearing them.. those who unwisely&nbsp; entertain thoughts or acts contrary
to the revolution. Screams, continuing hour after hour can be quite a
convincing deterrent.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

The subject in question, Tsu Ming, is the beautiful
young wife of a local merchant, thought correctly, to be fomenting unrest
amongst the local peasantry.&nbsp; He had wisely disappeared from his home and
business when warned that he was under scrutiny.&nbsp; The local commissar of
course wished to know his whereabouts. It was naturally supposed his delectable
young wife knew where he was.&nbsp; And so she had been arrested and brought in
to answer a few questions.&nbsp;&nbsp; Unfortunately for her she had no idea
her husband had been involved in unapproved activities, nor had she any idea to
where he had disappeared .&nbsp; Suffice to say she was&nbsp; not believed. Consequently she&nbsp;
had been delivered to Fan Wooh, in order that
the truth could be ascertained.

Uncommonly among most of her people she was tall of stature.&nbsp; Innocent and
beautiful of face, she was a stunningly developed woman, with long silky jet
black hair, full breasts, long svelte legs, and a delightfully fulsome
derriere.&nbsp; Her skin was smooth as ivory and the same lustrous shade,
blemish free it glistened with the sweat of her torture in the harsh glare of
the lights in the darkened chamber.

Her preliminary questioning had begun some hours earlier.&nbsp; Her screams
have been heard throughout the day. Passersby shuddered and hurried past the
forbidding edifice from which her terrible screaming had gone on for hours. Fan
Wooh's servants were very talented in wringing ear
splitting screams from reluctant persons under question.

The screams rose in intensity at times. The wails and shrieks
of unspeakable agony going on and on.&nbsp; This portion of the subjects ordeal was not really intended to elicit the
information desired, in fact the question was not even asked.&nbsp; It was
simply to give the one being interrogated a sample of what was to come if they
foolishly persisted in withholding the information requested when it was
finally revealed to the unfortunate..&nbsp; In other
words, torture for the sake of torture. For the entertainment
and amusement of those inflicting it.

When Fan Wooh entered the torture chamber and caught
sight of his prey he gasped at her flawless beauty.&nbsp; All
HIS, to play with and ruthlessly enjoy her screams of agony as he subjected her
to his fiendish depredations.

His minions were enjoying themselves beating her with bamboo sticks. She hung
suspended from a 3 foot long bar hanging from the roof, her arms strapped to
the ends.&nbsp; Her feet, some 12 inches off the floor were spread, and
strapped to rings in the stone floor some 3-4 feet apart.&nbsp; Her spread
eagled body was bathed in sweat which coursed down her lush body, dripping into
a puddle beneath her.&nbsp; 

Her entire body, front and rear was covered with welts and bruises from the
beating being administered by two of the minions of Fan Wooh,
one beating her front, the other her back.&nbsp; 

Tsu Ming screamed and begged for mercy.&nbsp; She
knew not why she had been brought to this horrible place and begged for an
explanation.&nbsp; For the beating and pain to stop.

Fan Wooh raised a hand and the thugs ceased the
cudgeling of the poor girl. He approached the shuddering woman and looked up at
her still trembling body.

&quot;Your husband is an enemy of the revolution and is plotting against it&nbsp; He was warned of his impending arrest and has
fled.&nbsp; We wish to know where he is and his intentions.&nbsp;&nbsp; You
will give us this information!&quot;

&quot;That cannot be true!&nbsp; My husband is a merchant and a faithful member
of the party.&nbsp; He would never do such a thing.&quot;

&quot;We know that to be untrue.&nbsp; He is plotting insurrection and has gone
into hiding.&nbsp; You will tell us where he has gone and his plan for
revolt.&quot;

&quot;I know nothing of such affairs.&nbsp; I have no idea where he has gone.&nbsp;
When I awoke yesterday morning he had disappeared. I do not believe he is
plotting anything against the government.&quot;

&quot;You lie Tsu
Ming!&nbsp; You will tell us what we wish or today is as child's play compared
to what I will do.&nbsp; Now tell me!&quot;

&quot;But sir I do not have what you wish.&quot;

Turning to one of his savants he says, &quot;Get Chang!&quot;

The lackey scurries off nodding and jabbering &quot;is good,,
is good,&nbsp; Chang fix her good.&quot;

Shortly the door to the chamber opens and a giant apparition
enters.&nbsp;&nbsp; So huge he must stoop to get through the opening.&nbsp; He
is dark brown with a head shaved but for a circle at the back of his enormous
head from which a long braid hangs.&nbsp; His chest is bare and broad the
muscles rippling.&nbsp; His arms are like tree trunks, the muscles bulging as
he swings his arms.&nbsp;&nbsp; His thighs are as big around as a normal mans
waist.&nbsp; On his ugly face a malevolent lustful leer as he looks the poor Tsu Ming up and down, licking his lips, revealing crooked
yellow teeth.&nbsp; 

Tsu Ming's eyes bulge in horror at the brutish
phantasm approaching her.

&quot;Chang, this is Tsu Ming, she claims she does
not know where her husband has flown to.&nbsp; I believe she does.&nbsp; In any
case she will not reveal this information.&nbsp; I would like you to help her
change her mind.&quot;

&quot;It will be a pleasure Master.&nbsp; Are there any limits as to what I may
do?&quot;

&quot;None.&nbsp; Just so long as she screams loudly,
and offers entertainment.&quot;

&quot;I see your friends have been at work with those clumsy rods.&nbsp;&nbsp;
I think what she needs is something far&nbsp; more
slender and flexible.&quot;

Chang goes to the wall and grasps a thin, flexible bamboo cane, swishing it
back and forth.&nbsp; Tsu Ming watches, her eyes
bulging in terror.

&quot;I ask you once more,,,,where
is your traitorous husband! Tell me or you will suffer pain you cannot imagine!&quot;

Tsu Ming's voice quavers as she denies knowing where
her husband has fled.

Fan Wooh nods to Chang.&nbsp; 

Chang stands to one side and a bit to her rear.&nbsp; Swinging the cane with
his formidable strength he places a lash across her firm bottom globes.&nbsp; Tsu Ming screams and twists.&nbsp; Chang strikes again,
laying the wicked instrument across her cheeks again.
Again and again Chang slashes Tsu Ming's buttocks,
and slowly working his way down onto the backs of her thighs.&nbsp; Whipping her tender flesh from the backs of her knees to her tender
cheeks.&nbsp; 

Tsu Ming is shrieking at the top of her lungs as
Chang whips her body, red welts crisscrossing her tormented flesh.

&quot;AAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR!!!!&nbsp; EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!!&quot;
&nbsp; 
Her slender frame shakes and twists in agony, her screams bounding from the
stone walls..To those on the
street outside it sounds as if they are tearing an animal to shreds, the
shrieking goes on and on.

&quot;YYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYEEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!!&quot;

&quot;NNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNGGGGGGGGGGAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!&quot;

Chang moves in front of Tsu Ming.&nbsp; She gazes
down at her torturer, weeping and begging for mercy. Chang merely grins and
lashes out with the instrument of torture, slashing across her spread
body.&nbsp; He whips her inner thighs from knee to crotch, her slender waist
and abdomen.&nbsp; He pauses and looks at the magnificent globes upon her
chest.&nbsp; Tsu Ming sees his gaze and shakes her
head.

&quot;NOOO!!!&nbsp;&nbsp; NOOO!!!&nbsp; You cannot,&nbsp; please,,,, NOOOO!!!!!&quot;

Taking careful aim Chang draws back his
bulging arm and slashes a blow across those proud mounds.&nbsp;&nbsp; Tsu Ming's screams raises the hair on the necks of persons
passing in the street.

&quot;AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHHHHAAA&quot;

Chang raises his arm and lashes again across her breasts.&nbsp; Instead of the
broad bruises of the heavy rods used earlier, the cane leaves narrow cutting
striations on the once flawless skin. Tsu Ming
screams and thrashes as her breasts are viciously thrashed.&nbsp; A
particularly well aimed blow cuts directly across both her nipples.&nbsp; Her
mouth is stretched wide as she howls and shrieks, her
screams echoing into the street outside. 

&quot;EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!!&quot;

Her head twists from side to side flinging droplets of water from her soaked
hair.&nbsp; 

Her breasts heave and shake as Tsu Ming screams as
each demonic lash of the cane cuts her lacerated globes.&nbsp; She strains and
thrashes against her bindings, the muscles of her arms and legs ripple in
convulsive contractions as she strains against the bindings.&nbsp; The whipping
goes on and on.

Chang whips Tsu Ming for nearly an hour, moving from
front to back, side to side.&nbsp; Always returning to rain
blow after blow upon her luscious mounds of femininity.&nbsp; The
screams are constant, Tsu
Ming pleads and begs for mercy.

&quot;PLEASE!!! Anything!&nbsp;&nbsp; I'll do anything you wish!&nbsp; Just
STOP!!&nbsp; PLEASE!! NO MORE!!&quot;

Fan Wooh holds up his hand and Chang ceases his
beating.&nbsp; Tsu Ming quivers and shakes in unbearable
agony, hanging naked and exposed.

&quot;Are you ready to tell us where your miserable husband has gone?&quot;

&quot;I do not know the information you desire sir.&quot;

Fan Wooh nods to Chang.&nbsp; Chang slashes the
infernal cane across Tsu Ming's breasts again.&nbsp; 

&quot;AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHA!!!!!!!&quot;

Chang continues lashing Tsu Ming another 20
minutes.&nbsp;&nbsp; Her screams are&nbsp; unending,
her body convulses and shudders as she writhes under the torture..

&quot;Take her down!&nbsp; Let us treat her to something different.&nbsp; Maybe&nbsp; that will change her mind.&quot;

As she is lowered to the floor Tsu Ming collapses
into a heap on the cold hard stone.

Chang has them drag her to a pair of stout posts imbedded into the floor.&nbsp;
They are finished in shining red lacquer, carved intricately with dragons,
gilded in gold. A substantial crosspiece, finished and
painted in similar fashion spans between the posts some 5 feet from the floor.

PART 2

Assistants carry Tsu Ming to the
device.&nbsp; One grasps her body about the waist and lifts her till her
shoulders are level with the crosspiece.&nbsp; Others bind her arms&nbsp; along the top of the crosspiece with leather straps,
cuffs at her wrists are tied out to the posts and drawn tight, stretching her
arms.&nbsp; Cuffs at her ankles are tied by ropes to heavy iron rings in the
bases of the gold and red posts.&nbsp;&nbsp; A leather belt is buckled about
her tiny waist and a rope, secured to a ring in the front,&nbsp;
is looped through an iron ring in a post in front of her.&nbsp; The rope
is tightened, pulling her middle forward until she is bent in a sharp arch, her
legs spread and extended behind her, belly and stupendous breasts thrust up and
forward.

&quot;Now my child.&nbsp; Where has your traitorous
husband gone to hide?&quot;

&quot;I do not know sir.&quot;

&quot;Oh I think you do!&nbsp; Maybe you just need something to refresh your
memory, hmmmm?&quot;

&quot;But I do not know where he may have gone.&quot;

&quot;You try my patience girl.&nbsp; You WILL tell me where your scheming husband
has gone or I will use stronger methods to loosen your lying tongue!&nbsp; What
you have experienced until now is mere child's play!&quot;

&quot;But you must believe me, I do not know where he
could be.&quot;

Fan Wooh nods to an assistant who rolls a low cabinet over beside the trembling
girl.&nbsp; There are all sorts of tools and implements arranged on its top.

Fan Wooh moves to it and opens the lid on a large beautifully finished and
carved lacquer box.&nbsp;&nbsp; Inside are what appear to be many,many wooden sticks.&nbsp; Actually they are bamboo slivers
with fire hardened points and tiny barbs facing towards the points.

Fan Wooh has a nose hook placed in Tsu Ming's nostrils and the thong attached
to it drawn up over her head&nbsp; to the lacquered
beam behind her.&nbsp; Tsu Ming's head is&nbsp; tilted
sharply back as the cruel hook tears at her nostrils, she can but stare at the
ceiling above and imagine what this monster plans to do to
her.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tears spring to her eyes and run down her cheeks at the
pain.&nbsp; 

&quot;Now my little liar we will see how strong your will is to protect your
rebellious husband.&quot;

&quot;I do not know.&nbsp; I do not know!&quot;

&quot;You lie!!&quot;

With the hook pulling on her nose the septum is widely exposed.&nbsp; Fan Wooh
picks up a bamboo sliver and placing the point to that nerve rich spot presses it
into and through the flesh.

Tsu Ming tries to twist her head but the hook in her nose keeps her head
immoveable. She screams in pain as Fan Wooh twists and forces the diabolical
bamboo through her nose.&nbsp; Her body shakes and trembles,
shivers running up and down her stretched arms and torso.

Grasping and ear Fan Wooh presses a sliver through the upper lobe. Tsu Ming&nbsp; screams again, unable to move her head but her legs
are jerking and quaking.

&quot;EEEEEEEYYYYYYYYYYYIIIIIIIIII&quot;&nbsp; STOP!!&quot;

Fan Wooh ignores her pleas.&nbsp; She had her chance, now she will learn what
real pain is. 

Fan Wooh pierces her ear in four more places, then, moves to the other ear.

Tsu Ming is beside herself as she screams and struggles as best she can. Spasms
and convulsions ripple along her arms, her legs jerk and shudder.&nbsp; This is
pain as she never could have imagined.&nbsp; The monster torturing her
continues thrusting the slivers of bamboo through her flesh. A
sheen of torture sweat covers her magnificent body.&nbsp; It runs in
little rivulets down her ivory skin to drip to the floor.

Fan Wooh picks up a hard leather ring&nbsp; 2 inches
in diameter.&nbsp;&nbsp; With metal prongs he stretches Tsu Ming's mouth wide,
nearly dislocating it and presses the ring into her mouth behind her
teeth.&nbsp; The next sliver is heavier and longer than the others, he touches
it to her cheek.&nbsp; Pressing slowly and methodically it pierces the skin and
cuts through the meat of her cheek into her mouth.&nbsp; He continues twisting
and forcing the shaft until it pierces the other cheek.&nbsp; Pressing harder
he forces it till it tears through and the bamboo shaft protrudes from both
sides of her face.

Tsu Ming shrieks in agony at the heinous and barbaric violation of her
body.&nbsp;&nbsp; She is helpless to do naught but thrash and scream.

Fan Wooh continues driving bamboo slivers into Tsu Ming's flesh.&nbsp; He
pinches a bit of skin under her chin, pulling it out and stabbing through it.
He uses the same technique to skewer dozens of slivers through her arms from
shoulder to her wrists.&nbsp; Muscles seize and convulse, Tsu Ming strains at
the cruel bindings holding her immobile as this fiend drives sliver after
sliver through her cringing screaming flesh.

Tsu Ming screams and shrieks in agony.&nbsp; With the leather ring in her mouth
she cannot speak but her screams tell volumes as they bound and rebound from
the walls of the chamber.&nbsp; 

Fan Wooh directs his attention to the ivory&nbsp; smooth,
flesh of Tsu Ming's torso. He releases the nose hook so she is able to look
down in terror as he proceeds with his hellish work. Her eyes nearly pop from
their sockets as she watches in terror as he stabs the devilish slivers through
the flesh on her sides moving from hip to armpit.&nbsp; Through the fleshy
muscle that stretches from upper arm to armpit.&nbsp; There are well over a hundred
of the fiendish slivers sticking through various parts of her body.

Fan Wooh removes the ring from her mouth. Tsu Ming is howling in agony, her
breath comes in great heaving gasps, her chest rapidly rising and falling
making her bounteous breasts shake and jiggle. The sweat of torture runs from
her body dripping into puddles under her tormented being.

&quot;Do you recall now where your pig of a husband is?&quot;

Tsu Ming, between wails of pain and agony, her voice quivering denies knowledge
of his whereabouts.

&quot;Mercy! Please!&nbsp; Stop this!&nbsp;&nbsp; I do
not have the information you seek! Have mercy!&nbsp; Oh God...PLEASE
STOP!!!!&quot;

&quot;Sooo.... you call upon the deities of the unclean westerners.&nbsp; I
need no further proof that you are lying.&nbsp; I will continue until you
surrender and tell me the truth!&quot;

Tsu Ming's body is skewered by literally hundreds of the diabolical
slivers.&nbsp; Her bright scarlet blood trickles from the many&nbsp; insidious barbs.

Fan Wooh resumes his barbarous task.&nbsp; He pierces her thighs, carefully
placing the horrific slivers through the flesh along the backs and inner
muscles, downward to her calves running them completely through the meatiest
portions.&nbsp; Tsu Ming thrashes and shakes, muscles cramping and tensing,
convulsions shake them as the savage torture goes on and on, her screams
piercing the air. 

Fan Wooh stands in front of the sobbing , wailing
young woman so cruelly trussed before him.&nbsp; He reaches forth with his hand
and cups one of her bountiful breasts, a demonic smile curves his lips.

&quot;The cords&quot; he calls to his assistant.

The assistant scurries to a cabinet and returns with some silken cords.&nbsp;
Fan Wooh makes a loop in the end of one.&nbsp; He lifts one of Tsu Ming's
luscious globes and slips the loop around it.&nbsp; Pulling on the loose end he
tightens it around her breast.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He saws it tighter and
tighter, the prodigious flesh of her tit flesh bulges around the cord.&nbsp; He
winds the loose end around the entrapped orb, tighter and tighter till it is
distended like a large ball, the nipple bloated and stiff.&nbsp; He takes another
cord and does the same to her other mammary.&nbsp; They stand out like two
large spheres on her strained chest, the nipples swollen and erect.&nbsp; They
turn blue, then darker and finally they are two deep purple globes bulging from
her upper torso.

Tsu Ming is whimpering and sobbing as the blood congeals in her superb
mounds.&nbsp; 

&quot;Now.&nbsp; Do you wish to tell me where your
foul husband is?&nbsp; Or shall I introduce your monumental appendages to my
friends here?&quot;

&quot;I do not know where my husband is!&nbsp; Why won't you believe
me?&nbsp;&nbsp; I tell you the truth!&nbsp; I do not know!&quot;

&quot;Very well then!&nbsp;&nbsp; Let us move ahead then&quot;

&quot;NOOOOOOOOO!!!!!&nbsp;&nbsp; YOU CANNOT DO THIS!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
STOP!!&nbsp; PLEASE!!!!&nbsp;&nbsp; STOP!!!&nbsp;&nbsp; I DON'T KNOWWWW!!&quot;

Fan Wooh delves into his box of bamboo and takes out a special one with barbs
on the slender shaft.&nbsp;&nbsp; He holds it up to Tsu Ming's
face.&nbsp;&nbsp; Her eyes widen, she shakes her head.

&quot;NO!! NOOOO!!!! &quot;

Fan Wooh picks up a large pair of bamboo tweezers. Grasping one of her nipples
in it's end, he stretches it out.&nbsp; Tsu Ming screeches
and tries to move away, her eyes staring in horror.&nbsp; When he has drawn the
nipple as far as he can, Fan Wooh places the point of the sliver to the outside
of the nipple and slowly forces it through the tender morsel&nbsp;&nbsp; Tsu
Ming throws her head back and a high pitched shriek issues from her mouth.

&quot;EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!&quot;

While continuing to hold the nipple in the grip of the grip of the tweezers Fan
Wooh retrieves and presses another bamboo spear through the same nipple at
right angles to the first.&nbsp; Fan Wooh nods and smiles in approval..

He clamps the tweezers over her other nipple and stretches it out.&nbsp; Tsu
Ming is shaking her head, her eyes riveted on her nipple.

&quot;NOOO!!!!!!&nbsp;&nbsp; NOOOOOO!!!!!&nbsp;&nbsp; NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!&quot;

Fan Wooh pierces the nipple with the sliver making sure he does so slowly,
twisting and sawing it through peak.&nbsp;&nbsp; Tsu Ming twists and shakes her
torso, trying to move her swollen breast and it's
tender nipple away, but the vicious fiend merely waits till she stops for an
instant and jabs the point of the second sliver into her flesh.&nbsp; 

Tsu Ming stares down at her grossly swollen purple breasts, her distended
nipples skewered by the barbarous bamboo slivers,&nbsp; her
lips quiver as she screams in agony.&nbsp; Tears course down her pain wracked
face to drip onto those tormented globes.&nbsp; 

Fan Wooh now opens another box, long and slender.&nbsp;&nbsp; He reaches in and
removes the mother of all bamboo skewers.&nbsp; It is 18 inches long and is as
thick as a slender finger.&nbsp; It's entire length is
ridged with tiny sharp barbs facing toward the pointed end. It has a fine
hardened point.&nbsp; Turning back to Tsu Ming, Fan Wooh displays a toothy
grin.&nbsp; He reaches out to one of her bulging mounds.&nbsp; Tsu Ming cannot
believe he is going to use this monstrous instrument on her.&nbsp; 

Fan Wooh places the point of the huge shaft to the outside of Tsu Ming's
breast. 

&quot;GOD NOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; IT'S NOT
POSSIBLE.......&nbsp;&nbsp; YOU CAN'T DO THIS!!!!&nbsp; I BEG
YOU......&nbsp;&nbsp; NOOOOOOOOOO!!!!&quot;

With a vicious twist Fan Wooh pierces the&nbsp; skin
of her breast, he twists and forces it into her tightly constricted flesh, the
tiny barbs tearing the delicate tissues.&nbsp; Tsu Ming is blubbering in pain
as the barbarous shaft penetrates deeper into her mammary.&nbsp; The skin in
the cleavage between her bound tits stretches out as the point of the skewering
bamboo bursts forth and moves on to dent into and pierce her other
globe.&nbsp;&nbsp; Fan Wooh pushes and twists the hellish shaft through her
mutilated breasts,&nbsp; pushing, twisting till it
emerges on the outside of her tit flesh.&nbsp; He keeps pushing until it
extends equally on both sides of her mammoth globes.&nbsp; Blood runs down from
the hideous wounds, mixing with the sweat.&nbsp;&nbsp; 

Tsu Ming is howling like a banshee at the savage defiling of her breasts.&nbsp;
She strains and shakes as the malevolent fiend tortures her.&nbsp; The muscles
of her torso twitch and shudder, tremors ripple up and down her limbs as
convulsions and contractions of sinew and muscles make her shake and vibrate in
her bondage.

Fan Wooh steps back to admire his efforts.&nbsp; Tsu Ming is in unutterable agony, her body is festooned with hundreds of bamboo
slivers.&nbsp; Her breasts are bound and hideously pierced by more bamboo,
culminating in their barbaric skewering.

&quot;One more chance before I stop playing and I use more persuasive
methods.&quot;

Tsu Ming is unable to speak and can merely shake her head.

&quot;Bring the candles.&quot;

PART 3

Tsu Ming is trussed tightly as she hangs on the red and gold posts.&nbsp; Her
body is pierced with hundreds of slender bamboo slivers, their tips fire
hardened.&nbsp; They quiver as wave after wave of tremors course up and down
her beautiful form.&nbsp; Her large breasts are tightly bound with silken cords
which sink deeply into her flesh at their base&nbsp; forcing them to bulge
forth, swelling they have turned a deep purple, the nipples large and impaled
by some of the diabolical bamboo slivers.&nbsp; A particularly long one skewers
both her breasts sticking from both sides of the tormented globes.

Fan Wooh looks into Tsu Ming's terrified eyes. The merciless fiend asks if she
is ready to reveal the whereabouts of her traitorous husband.

Since a bamboo sliver pierces through both her cheeks, and another through her
tongue she cannot speak but shakes her head indicating refusal.&nbsp; More than
likely still insisting she does not know where he has gone.

Fan Wooh turns to his assistant, &quot;The candles&quot;

Nodding and scurrying off he returns shortly with a bright lacquered tray with
several candles on it&nbsp; They are lit, the flames dancing in the slight air
moving in the torture room.

Fan Wooh picks one up and holds it before Tsu Ming's face.&nbsp; She looks
puzzled as to it's significance.&nbsp; Fan Wooh moves one toward a sliver
piercing one of her ears.&nbsp; Tsu Ming's eyes widen in terror as she realizes
what he intends to do.&nbsp; He touches the flame to the tip of a sliver in her
ear lobe.&nbsp; Tsu Ming tries to shake her head and extinguish the flaring
bamboo, but her head is held fast by the bands around it. Closer, closer the
flame burns. The it reaches her ear, a piercing shriek of pain bursts from her
mouth, a wailing scream bounding from the walls as the flame chars her flesh.

Fan Wooh lights another sliver, this one through a fold of flesh in her
armpit.&nbsp; Tsu Ming tenses, her muscles convulsing as she tries to shake
loose, she thrashes in convulsions of searing agony as the stench of her
burning flesh fills the air along with her screams and shrieks of agony.&nbsp;
Fan Wooh continues igniting the cruel slivers. Under her arms, along her sides,
up and down her legs.&nbsp; 

&quot;Just nod your head when you have had enough and wish to reveal where that
pig of a husband is hiding.&quot;

Tsu Ming, in excruciating, unbridled agony, her eyes roll back in their
sockets, wild in terror, she shakes and thrashes under the savage torture, her
screams piercing the air as the pitiless, sadistic fiend continues the barbaric
torture. 

Fan Wooh sets the candles aside and directs the assistant to remove the
remaining slivers from Tsu Ming.&nbsp; The first he chooses is the terrible one
piercing both breasts.&nbsp; As he twists and pulls it from her tormented
mammaries Tsu Ming shrieks in agony.&nbsp; The removal of each sliver is even
more painful than when they first pierced her flesh because of the barbs on the
shafts.&nbsp; The assistant is delighted as he twists each one eliciting ear
piercing screams.&nbsp; It takes nearly an hour of continuous, hair raising
shrieks before all are removed. The last two, the one through her tongue and
the one through her cheeks bring forth howls of agonized pain.

Two slivers have been left in her nipples.&nbsp; They have been left
intentionally.&nbsp; The silken cords are unwound from Tsu Ming's swollen and
distorted breasts.&nbsp; As the blood returns to the constricted globes the
pain is even more severe than the long time they were bound.&nbsp; As Tsu Ming
screams in excruciating torment. The assistant slowly twists and draws the last
two remaining slivers from the nipples.&nbsp; The agonizing pain is ten times
worse than all the others. 

Tsu Ming is unbound from the pillars.&nbsp; She collapses to the floor.&nbsp;
Her arms are twisted behind her and bound together, elbows touching.&nbsp; A
bamboo rod is pushed up under her armpits, then her arms are pulled forward and
wrists bound together in front.

Two silk ropes are lowered from the ceiling and fastened to the ends of the
bamboo rod.&nbsp; The ropes are then raised lifting Tsu Ming from the floor,
her toes just out of reach of the surface.&nbsp; Her ankles are then tied
together and she is raised till she is some two feet above the floor.&nbsp; The
edge of the bar under her arms has been shaved into a triangular shape,
the&nbsp; edge of which now cuts fiercely into her underarms.&nbsp; Tsu Ming
groans as the cruel edge burrows into her flesh.&nbsp; 

Fan Wooh looks up at the slowly swinging young woman and says, &quot;We return
later&quot; and he and his assistants walk to the door.

Tsu Ming, her words mushy and garbled because of her mutilated face and tongue
pleads for them not to leave her like this.

&quot;Just tell us where to find your husband and we will lower you.&nbsp;
Otherwise------!&quot;

Tsu Min frantically mumbles she does not know his whereabouts.

Fan Wooh and his entourage leave.&nbsp; The door closes and Tsu Ming hangs,
alone, the insidious rod cutting deeper and deeper into her flesh.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Minutes crawl by,&nbsp; the rod burrows into her arms.&nbsp; The pain bores
deep into her shoulders, surely they must tear from their sockets.&nbsp;
Flashes of pain lance up and down her arms. The muscles cramp, tremors flicker back
an forth, the muscles of her upper back quiver under the strain.&nbsp; 

An hour passes, surely the bar must cleave through her sinews and flesh,
severing her arms, the pain sears into her brain, the bar like a living
thing.&nbsp; Tsu Ming moans and begs.&nbsp; It is not possible for one to
endure such torment

Another hour drags by. She sees flashes of light as bolts of unrelenting agony
tear at her.&nbsp; If only the feeling in her arms would cease because of cut
off circulation, but no, the pervading piercing pain bores through her body.

Another hour.&nbsp; Tsu Ming is hallucinating, she has separated herself from
the pervading torment of the implacable rod.&nbsp; But why does the terrible
pain go on then. 

The door opens and Fan Wooh enters.&nbsp; He glides across the floor of the torture
room.
Tsu Ming's head hangs down, a steady pitiable wail issues from her mouth along
with a stream of drool which cascades to her chest and runs between her proud
breasts.&nbsp; 

Fan Wooh looks up at Tsu Ming and placing his hand under her chin raises her
tear streaked face.&nbsp; She looks at Fan Wooh but her eyes fail to focus
properly.&nbsp; She KNOWS that this is the one responsible for her
suffering.&nbsp; She weakly mouths &quot;WHY?&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

&quot;Why?&nbsp;&nbsp; Why to loosen that stubborn tongue of yours my
child.&nbsp; Tell me does it hurt hanging that way?

Tsu Ming is too weak to speak.&nbsp; She feebly nods her head.

&quot;You know this can stop.&nbsp; Just tell me where your husband is and I
will see to it that this terrible thing ceases.&quot;

Shaking her head weakly Tsu Ming utters a barely audible, &quot;I do not
know&quot;

&quot;Foolish girl.&nbsp; You leave me no choice.&quot;

Fan Wooh nods to his assistant and motions toward the corner.

&quot;The stones.&quot;

The assistant scurries to the corner and returns carrying a heavy stone with an
iron ring imbedded in the top.&nbsp; He goes back and brings another.

&quot;One on each side.&nbsp; Hang them from her great toes.&quot;

The assistant loops silk cords around each of Tsu Ming's big toes.&nbsp; He
then lifts the stones one at a time and ties the cords from Tsu Ming's toes to
the rings in the stones.

Tsu Ming raises her face to the ceiling and a scream of one suffering the fires
of hell issues from her mouth.

&quot;EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEYYYYYYYYYYYOOOOOOOOOOOOOOWWWWWWWWWWWWWWAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!!!!!&quot;

&quot;Take them off!! Take them off!!!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR!!!!!&quot;

&quot;We will return after a short rest&quot;

&quot;NOO!!&nbsp; Don't leave&nbsp; me!&nbsp;&nbsp; Don't leave me like
this!&nbsp; NOOOOOOO!!!!!!&quot;

With that Fan Wooh and his assistant leave Tsu Ming to her agony.

Though weakened by her previous ordeal , Tsu Ming shrieks in unutterable agony
as the added weight of the stones makes the vicious rod bore ever deeper into
her tortured limbs.&nbsp; The pain is never ending, it invades every part of
her. Her toes are being torn from her feet and the added weight makes the pain
in her arms a hundred times worse. She hangs motionless the insidious rod
tearing at her arms and shoulders.&nbsp; She drifts in and out of
consciousness. And always there is the pain. She shakes her head back and
forth, screaming,.... always screaming.&nbsp; Her shrieks of agony go on and
on.&nbsp; Finally she just hangs, insensible in the blackness of
unconsciousness.

Fan Wooh has been watching Tsu Ming during the entire time of her
suffering.&nbsp; When it becomes obvious that she has escaped into the
blackness of insensibility, he renters the room and has her taken down.

&quot;Chain her in a cell till she revives.&nbsp; We will resume her
questioning when she awakes. There are many more ways to loosen her
tongue.&quot;

Tsu Ming is carried to a concrete cubicle no more than 10 feet square.&nbsp;
There are no windows, no furnishings of any kind, just bare smooth
concrete.&nbsp; A steel collar is bolted around her neck and a short chain runs
from it to ring in the floor.&nbsp; Even if her feet would support her, the
shortness of chain would not allow it.&nbsp; Her useless arms are cuffed and
joined by another short chain.&nbsp; The steel door clangs shut and Tsu Ming
lies insensible on the cold cement of her prison.&nbsp; There is no light, just
total blackness, and pain.

PART 4


Tsu Ming has lain in her cell for 6 days. She has been
given scant food and water, what food there was was vermin infested, the water
foul.&nbsp; A
  Dr.
administered healing herbs , ointments, and
various&nbsp; ancient Chinese cures, whose purpose was to ameliorate the
effects and physical marks of her torture.&nbsp; She shows no outward signs of
her ordeal.&nbsp; No wounds or scars, no tenderness where&nbsp;
her body was pierced and abused.&nbsp; When sleep comes she experiences
horrific nightmares, reliving the barbaric tortures visited upon her.&nbsp; 

Fan Wooh is growing impatient with her.

The door to her prison bangs open, a pair of guards
enter and unlock her chains.&nbsp; For the first time she is able to stand
upright.&nbsp; 

&quot;Time to chat with the master again treacherous
whore!&quot;

Tsu Ming shrinks back, pleading, she does not know
what they seek from her.&nbsp; She repeats that she really does not know where
her husband is, nor has she any knowledge that he is involved in traitorous
actions.

&quot;Master Wooh believes otherwise.&nbsp; He will extract everything you
know, eventually.&quot;

Visions of the pitiless and brutal tortures used by Fan Wooh
in his endeavor to extract information from her, flash through her mind, and
she panics in fear.

The guards haul her to her feet and drag her, fighting and wailing through
seemingly endless corridors and down stone steps.

They finally pause in front of a heavy door.&nbsp; Tsu Ming recognizes it from
her earlier visit and she pulls back.&nbsp; 

At that moment a long drawn out scream of terrible magnitude was heard through
the door.&nbsp; Someone was being horribly tortured in that foul
chamber......&nbsp; 

They flung open the door and thrust Tsu Ming inside.&nbsp; 

A beautiful, naked young woman was stretched between the terrible posts where
Tsu Ming had been spread just a few days before.&nbsp; An enormous giant of a
man stood in front of her, wielding a vicious whip,&nbsp;
scourging the subjects front side. Zhiang is&nbsp;
over 6 feet tall and weighs over 350 pounds, rolls of fat cascade down
his body.&nbsp; He was naked save a leather apron covering his middle. He was
lashing the unprotected young woman, thrashing in agony and screaming in front
of him.

Fan Wooh held up his hand and the giant paused in his&nbsp;
handiwork.&nbsp; 

&quot;Ah!&nbsp; Our guest has arrived. Secure her over there so she may have an
unhampered view of the proceedings. &quot;

Tsu Ming stared at the poor creature between the posts.&nbsp; The beautiful
young girl trembled and wept.&nbsp; She raised her head and Tsu Ming was aghast
in horror.&nbsp; The young girl being thrashed, was her 16 year old sister, Su
Wei..&nbsp; A mere child, they had her trussed like an
animal between the posts..&nbsp; She was indeed
beautiful, and when fully developed would be at least the equal of Tsu Ming in
eye-filling bountiful treasures.&nbsp; Her skin smooth and had been
unblemished.&nbsp; Her breasts full and round tremble on her chest, her
lithesome legs are spread and stretched tautly.&nbsp; She is moaning and
trembling in fear and pain.

&quot;What are you doing?&nbsp; She knows less than I in this matter. &quot;

&quot;Quite likely I should think.&nbsp; However, it may be that it will
improve your memory as you watch her being questioned. You will have an
excellent view of what we do to her.&quot;

&quot;You filthy beast!&nbsp; She is completely innocent of anything!&quot;

&quot;Yes I know. But watch as we play our delightful games with her.&nbsp; You
can stop us at any time simply by telling me what I ask.&quot;

&quot;I tell you I do not know the answer you want!&nbsp; I do not know where
my husband has gone!&quot;

&quot;Yes. Well then we shall resume our play.&quot;

Tsu Ming hears the sound of struggles and muffled shouts to one side.&nbsp; She
turns her head, and mounted on a bamboo frame spreading her beauteous naked
body is Mei Ling, her mother.&nbsp; Though a woman of her late thirties she is
still sumptuously formed&nbsp; and rounded.&nbsp; Her
arms are spread along a stout bamboo pole, strapped at wrist, elbow and
armpit.&nbsp; Her shapely legs are spread at 90 degrees to her torso along a
similar bamboo pole, strapped to it at ankles, above the knee and the top of
her thighs.&nbsp; A nose hook has been inserted and is pulled up and fastened
to a head harness, tilting her face slightly up.&nbsp; Hooks in either side of
her mouth, are pulled back and fasten to the harness. They give her face a
distorted grimace, her lips pulled tight, teeth exposed, mouth open. She is
whimpering and moans through her distorted mouth, tears flow down her face as
she watches the torture of her daughter.

Cursing Fan Wooh and his henchmen, Tsu Ming is forced to another frame facing
her manacled and spread mother and sister.&nbsp; Her arms are bent over a
sturdy bamboo pole, 4 feet above the floor.&nbsp; They are curled around and
upwards till her hands are beside her head.&nbsp; Straps are fastened to a
wrist, passed behind her head then strapped to her other wrist.&nbsp; Her
bounteous breasts are thrust up and forward.&nbsp; Her calves are doubled back
under her thighs and a wide strap buckled around ankle and thigh, binding them
together.&nbsp; When they finish she appears to be kneeling, her knees some 18
inches above the floor, hanging by her twisted arms. 

&quot;If everyone is comfortable, we will resume our endeavor.&quot;

&quot;Please I beg you.&nbsp; None of us know the information you seek.&quot;

&quot;I do not believe you!&nbsp; I think you not only know where your
traitorous husband has gone to hide, but that you too are involved with his
rebellious band&quot;

&quot;NO!&nbsp; NO!&nbsp; That is not true!&nbsp; You must believe me!&nbsp; We
know nothing!&quot;

&quot;Lies! All lies!&nbsp; I will have the truth or none of you will live to
leave this room!&quot;

Fan Wooh gestures to the rogue who had been whipping Su Wei and motions to the
mother, Mei Ling.

&quot;Let me hear how the antecedent of these two specimens can sing for
us.&quot;

Zhaing lumbers to Mei Ling. Her&nbsp; eyes nearly pop
from her head as the gross, ugly, monstrosity, waddles toward her.&nbsp; She
wriggles, and struggles, gibberish tumbles from her deformed mouth, her head
shaking back and forth,&nbsp; eyes darting to and fro
in terror.

Zhaing cups one of her luxuriant breasts in a huge hand, and a demonic grin
spreads across his features. Very fine, yes very fine.
So soft and sensitive.

Mei Lings' breasts are indeed quite lovely.&nbsp; They show no sign of sagging
and the nipples indicate she had suckled both her offspring, they are fat and
at least a half inch long.&nbsp; Zhaing will have much fun with these luscious
orbs.

Cupping the globe in his huge hand Zhaing rubs his thumb back and forth across
the peak bringing it to full erection.&nbsp; Crossing to a table he returns
with two cords in his hand.&nbsp; He forms a loop in one end and slips it over
the stiff nub, drawing it tight. He does the same with the other jutting
point.&nbsp; He lowers a steel ring and threads the cords&nbsp;
through it and ties the ends together, then hangs a 3 pound lead weight
from the knotted ends. Mei Ling gasps in pain as her hardened nipples&nbsp; are nearly wrenched from the large globes.

Zhaing selects a slender bamboo cane from his array of whips and flails and
approaches Mei Ling.&nbsp; Mei Ling is trembling in terror as he taps the
flexible shaft in his palm.&nbsp; His mouth twisting in a sadistic sneer and he
licks his lips, as he eyes the succulent woman spread before him.

&quot;Where first, ehh?'

Mei Ling, eyes bulging in terror, stares at the fearsome rod,
shaking her head, a wail surging from her twisted mouth. She is helpless
and at the mercy of this odious creature. She strains and struggles against the
leather straps binding her, muscles shivering in dread anticipation.

Zhaing raises his arm and lays a terrible slash across Mei Lings' taut
stomach.&nbsp; It leaves a livid red stripe across the tender flesh.&nbsp; 

SSHHWWAAAAACCCKKK!

&quot;EEEEEEEEEEEE!&quot;

He follows with another next to the first.

SWWWAAAAACCCCKKKK!!

&quot;AAAAAAAARRRRR!!!

Zhaing sets up a steady beat. Pausing between each blow to
allow the full searing pain to radiate from the scourged flesh.

SWWWWAAACCCKKK!

SWAAAAACCCKKKK!!

SSWWWWWAAAAAACCCKKKKK!

Zhiang lays lash after lash over the quivering belly of the howling woman....
Her wails of agony bouncing from the walls to reverberate
back and forth.&nbsp; He moves to her inner thighs and lacerates them
from crotch to knee.

SWWWWWAAAAACCCKKKKK!!

SWAAAAAACCCCKKKKKK!!!

Mei Ling is shaking and thrashing against the straps holding her, the sinews of
her arms and legs taut and straining in sharp relief, her head twisting and
turning. A howl of unfathomable agony issues from her mouth. She is drooling
and it dribbles from her distorted mouth to her heaving breasts and runs down
her stretched body, dripping to the floor.

Zhiang pauses, his gaze traveling upwards.

Mei Ling sees his look and her eyes widen in terror.&nbsp;&nbsp; She screams
what is obviously a long wailing NOOOOOOOO!!!!, her
head shaking back and forth..

Taking meticulous aim he brings the fearsome cane down with all his
considerable strength, fully across the upper slopes of Mei Lings' distended
breasts.&nbsp; Mei Ling throws her head back, a cry like one from an animal
being torn asunder bursts from her distorted mouth.&nbsp; 

SWWWWWWAAAAAAACCCCCCKKKKKKK!!!!

&quot;AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!&quot;

Again.

SWWWWAAAAAACCKKKKKKKKK!!!

And again.

SWWWWWAAAACCCCCKKKKKK!!!!

Mei Ling screams in untrammeled agony.

Zhaing lacerates her breasts over and over, pausing only long enough to switch
to flailing the undersides of the soft tender orbs. Then he returns to lashing
her thighs and stomach before once more bludgeoning her tender breasts...

At last he ceases belaboring Mei Lings' quivering body.&nbsp; She shudders and
shakes, her entire being vibrating in pain as she shrieks in piercing agony,
her muscles convulsing and straining as she struggles.

Tsu Ming is screaming for them to stop, that she could have no knowledge of Tsu
Ming's husbands activities.

&quot;Then talk. Only you have the power to stop this.&nbsp; Talk and we will
cease, otherwise we shall return to your beloved sister.&quot;

&quot;You wouldn't dare!&nbsp;&nbsp; She is only a child!&nbsp;&nbsp; Leave her
be!&quot;

&quot;Perhaps, but she has such a delightful voice when she screams don't you
think?&quot;

&quot;Let her alone!&nbsp; None of us have the information you ask.&quot;

&quot;So be it then.&nbsp; Perhaps if we play with her while you watch and
listen to her screams, it will help your memory.&nbsp; Zhiang!&nbsp; The small
one again, and move in another direction this time.&quot;

&quot;Of course master, it will be most pleasurable for me.&quot;

PART 5

Zhaing lumbers over to Su Wei, strapped between the posts. Reaching out with
both hands he cups and squeezes her well developed breasts,giggling,
&quot;nice,very nice....hurt very much.&quot;

Tsu Ming screams at Zhaing, &quot;leave her alone!&nbsp; She doesn't know anything&quot;

&quot;Ahh but you DO!&nbsp; And you will tell me all!&quot;

&quot; I DO NOT KNOW the information you ask.&quot;

&quot;I believe you do. And you will tell me all.&nbsp; I think that watching
as Zhaing applies his skill at inflicting pain on your sister and mother your
memory will improve.&quot;

&quot;I keep telling you I do not know where my husband has gone, and neither
do my mother or sister.&nbsp; You must believe me!&quot;

&quot;You are lying....... Zhaing you may proceed.&quot;

Zhaing waddles to the cart nearby on which his tools and implements are piled,&nbsp; implements whose sole purpose is to inflict pain on
whomever he is working on.&nbsp; He picks up a device made of two slabs of
wood, joined near the ends by long threaded bolts&nbsp; with
butterfly nuts on top .&nbsp; He moves back to Su Wei and places it high on her
chest, the top and bottom pieces above and below her&nbsp;
breasts.&nbsp; Seizing a breast he yanks it through the open space, then does the same to the other.&nbsp; Holding it up under
the lush mounds, her turns the screws moving the slabs closer together.&nbsp;
They soon are squashing her flesh between the wood plates.&nbsp; Her breasts
turn blue then a dark purple as they are compressed between the boards.&nbsp;
There are several straps dangling from the ends of the device. He takes two and
wrapping them around her torso, buckles them in back.&nbsp; The other two he
pulls up and around her neck buckling them in back&nbsp; The
purpose of course is to keep the press along with her breasts up high.&nbsp; He
continues tightening the screws, mashing her tender globes between them, her
breasts bulging out like toothpaste squeezed from a tube, the nipples swelling
and bulging forth.&nbsp; 

Su Wei gazes down at her deformed breasts, her eyes wide in terror, whimpering
as the vice gets tighter and tighter.&nbsp; 

Zhaing goes back to his cart and returns with another wooden slat which has
short stiff wires fastened to either end with hooks bent into the free
ends.&nbsp; These he hooks over the threaded screws on the tit press so that
the slat rests under her breasts.&nbsp; He roughly pulled on each breast in
turn pulling them as far through the jaws of the press as he could.&nbsp; Then
he went back to his cart and returned holding a hammer and some nails.&nbsp;
Pinching a nipple he stretched it forward, and, placing the point of a nail to
the upper surface of the nipple he struck the head of the nail with the hammer,
driving the nail through her nipple and into the wood.&nbsp; 

Su Wei screamed and struggled against the straps holding her arms and legs to
the posts.

Zhaing gave the nail a couple more sharp raps to be sure they were well seated
through her nipple and into the wood.&nbsp; Grabbing the other nipple he
stretched it in the same manner.&nbsp; 

Knowing now his intention Su Wei screamed, writhing against the straps.

Undeterred Zhaing nailed her nipple to the board in similar fashion to the first.&nbsp;
To be sure they were securely fastened he spiked additional nails through her
tit on either side of the original ones.&nbsp; Su Wei howled in pain, blood
streamed from her pierced breasts, running down her sweat sheened torso to drip
to the floor beneath her.&nbsp; Zhaing tightened the screws several more turns, blood spurted from her crushed and mutilated breasts,
splashing onto a delighted Zhaing.

Su Wei howled like a banshee as her skewered, crushed breasts were further
smashed while he tightened the press even more.

Tsu Ming was screaming at them to stop the torture, that her sister knew
nothing.

&quot;Talk, and I will stop Zhaing!&quot;

&quot;None of us know anything about my husbands whereabouts!&quot;

'I'm losing my patience with you you traitorous harlot!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; HANG
HER Zhaing!&quot;

Zhaing brutally twisted and pulled the nails from Su Wei's nipples causing her
to scream even more.&nbsp;&nbsp; He loosed the press and as the blood rushed
back into the generous globes it was worse than when they were mashed between
the slabs.&nbsp; Su Wei shrieked in agony, shaking her head back and forth, the
sweat flinging from her hair.

Zhaing picks up two lengths of rope.&nbsp; He winds one tightly around the base
of one breast, knotting it at the top, leaving the long end dangling.&nbsp;
Then he does the same to the other.&nbsp; Next he reaches up and ties the two
ends to two hooks, about shoulder width apart,&nbsp; hanging
from above. He turns a crank on the side of one of the posts and the hooks
rise, he raises then until the ropes are taut, lifting her breasts.

He unstraps her arms from the posts and straps them together behind her, then
pushes a bamboo rod into the crook of her arms, thrusting her breasts
forward.&nbsp; He turns the crank again until most of her weight not supported
by her legs still strapped to the posts, is borne by her breasts.&nbsp; Now he
starts to unstrap her ankles from the posts.

&quot;What are you doing?&nbsp;&nbsp; Don't do that!&nbsp; I have no way to
support myself!&quot;

&quot;Yes you do little one.&nbsp; It's right there in front of you!&quot;

&quot;NO!&nbsp; NO!&nbsp; It isn't possible!&nbsp;&nbsp; It will tear me
apart!&nbsp; NOOO!!!!!&quot;

&quot;Not really.&nbsp; Go ahead Zhaing.&nbsp; Show her how resilient
they are!&quot;

Zhaing finishes releasing her ankles and her body swings free.&nbsp; Her entire
weight now supported by the ropes wound about her tortured breasts.&nbsp; 

&quot;EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!&quot;

Su Wei dangles from her breasts, stretched and torn, she slowly swings back and
forth, the ropes pulling each breast pulled at slightly different angles.&nbsp;
Her screams bounce from the walls of Fan Wooh's chamber of torture and torment.

&quot;AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!&quot;

Her screams pause only when she gasps more air into her lungs to scream again
and again.&nbsp; Her shrill shrieks of agony pierce the air and make the flesh
crawl as the excruciating pain tears at her breast flesh.&nbsp; 

&quot;NNNNNNNNNNNNNNNGGGGGGGGGGAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHH!!&quot;

Eventually the screams taper off to a steady wailing moan.&nbsp; 

&quot;Let me down! Let me down!&nbsp; Oh please!!!&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me down! OHHhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!&quot;

&quot;You heartless fiend. Let her down!&nbsp; She will be torn apart!
Let her down! Have mercy!&quot;

&quot;Talk!&nbsp; Then I let her down.&nbsp;&nbsp; TALK!&quot;

&quot;I cannot!&nbsp; I DO NOT KNOW the answer to your question.&quot;

&quot;Zhaing!&nbsp; The stones.&quot;

Zhaing pads to the corner and returns carrying a large stone with a ring
protruding from the top.&nbsp; He scuttles back to the corner and returns with
another stone like the first.&nbsp; They weigh 30 pounds each.&nbsp; Zhaing
takes a set of shackles and clamps them about her ankles.&nbsp; Then he lifts a
stone and hangs it from one ankle.&nbsp; The screams rise in volume and
shrillness...&nbsp; He raises and hangs the second stone from the other ankle.
The screaming rises higher yet. Su Wei's head twists and thrashes as the agony
mounts.&nbsp; She writhes and twists, her breasts bulging as the ropes bite
deeper, blood oozes from under the ropes where they tear her flesh.&nbsp; It
trickles down her strained torso.

&quot;AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHHHHAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!!&quot;

Su Wei's screams reverberate once again from the walls of the room.&nbsp; Her
head hangs back and she screams to the darkness above her, body twitching and
trembling. The pain is beyond belief as the ropes tear at her breasts.&nbsp; As
her screams once again regress to the steady wailing cry of a being under
extreme torture, Fan Wooh turns to Tsu Ming and asks her to reveal her husbands
hiding place.

Zhaing stands aside, his eyes shining in delight, his tongue
darting from between his lips to lick the spittle that drools from his
misshapen mouth.&nbsp; A dimwitted fool he may be but he knows what
excites and gives him extreme pleasure, the unrestrained torture of beautiful
women.

&quot;I DO NOT KNOW!&nbsp; I DO NOT KNOW!&nbsp; Please let her down!&nbsp; I DO
NOT KNOW!&quot;

&quot;You realize we can keep adding weights don't you?&nbsp; Eventually her
tits will indeed be torn from her.&nbsp; You wish to&nbsp;
remain silent as this happens?&quot;

&quot;I don't KNOW the information!&quot;

&quot;Zhaing, leave her hang.&nbsp; See if mother will
tell us!&quot;

&quot;She doesn't know either!&nbsp; You must let Su Wei down!&quot;

&quot;Of course we mustn't.&nbsp; Now,,, unless you
are prepared to tell me where your renegade husband is hiding, you will be
quiet while Zhaing ply's his talents with your mother.

Mei Ling has been watching the barbaric torture of her youngest daughter,
weeping and pleading for her release from the monstrous torment.

&quot;Please master!&nbsp; Release my little girl from this terrible
punishment!&quot;

&quot;She will be released when someone gives me the information I wish. Until
then she remains as she is.&nbsp; Where is the pig of a malcontent who is you
son-in-law hiding?&quot;

&quot;If my daughter says she doesn't not know where he has
gone, she does not have that information.&nbsp; She would not lie to you
master.&nbsp; My younger daughter I am sure does not know either, nor do
I.&nbsp; Nothing can change that.&quot;

&quot;You are three very stubborn, traitorous rebels.&nbsp; At least one of
you, more likely ALL of you, know where this pig is hiding and what his plans
are.&nbsp; You will give me this information.&nbsp; I WILL get it from one of
you.
Zhaing!&nbsp; Persuade this person the folly of her way!&quot;

&quot;Yes, yes master, will be much fun with this lady!&nbsp; May I ask for
some assistance from &quot;The Princess?&quot;

&quot;Whatever you wish Zhaing.&nbsp; I know your methods involve many
factors.&quot;

Pointing to one of his followers he orders him to request the presence of The
Princess.&nbsp; The fellow scurries off, to return in a very short time with
the Princess.&nbsp; 

The Princess is Fan Wooh's favorite daughter.&nbsp; She shares her fathers hatred of westerners and is likewise an avid
adherent of Mao's teachings. She is the product of her fathers mating with a
beautiful white woman he had raped during the course of her imprisonment and
prolonged torture..&nbsp; After the birth of the
Princess, Fan Wooh had her horribly tortured to death over a very long period
during which the most barbarous and hideous tortures he could devise were
used.&nbsp; 

The Princess was a magnificent creature of outstanding beauty and form. There
is nothing more beautiful or flawless than a Eurasia female. Her hair was shining raven black, always kept in flowing waves
extending down her back.&nbsp; Her complexion like the glow of ivory, flawless
and blemish free..&nbsp; Her breasts rode high on her
torso and were of generous proportions even for an overdeveloped westerner,&nbsp; said torso being slender and narrow of waist.&nbsp;
Her legs were long, sculpted magnificently, her tiny feet always shod in
extremely high heels, the toenails, like her fingernails lacquered brilliant
red.&nbsp; Her tastes in entertainment ran to watching and listening to her
fathers servants torturing unfortunates who ran afoul of him, preferably women.

She arrived in short order and looked approvingly at the three women trussed in
various ways.&nbsp;&nbsp; She particularly liked the breast hanging of Su
Wei.&nbsp; She was very partial to hanging beautiful women in this fashion, the screams were always delightful to listen
to.&nbsp; 

&quot;What is it you wish of me today father?&quot;

&quot;Zhaing would like a bit of your expertise, in certain areas, preparing
this person over there, gesturing to Mei Ling.&quot;

&quot;Of course father.&nbsp; May I stay and watch as he exercises his skills
as master torturer to Fan Wooh?&quot;

&quot;Of course my dear.&nbsp; Whatever will please
you.&quot;

&quot;Thank you father.&nbsp;&nbsp; Now Zhaing what is
it you wish me to do?&quot;

PART 6

Mei Ling has watched the barbarous torture of her youngest daughter in
horror.&nbsp; With her mouth grotesquely twisted by the cruel metal hooks
tearing at her lips she can only make the most rudimentary howls and grunts of
outrage at the monstrous torments being inflicted upon Su Wei's tortured
body.&nbsp; The vicious metal hooks are tearing at the corners of her mouth,
she is sure they will split the flesh and her face will be ripped.&nbsp; The
nose hook is like a living thing that any moment will sunder her delicate
nostrils.

The Princess' name is Peony Blossom, named for Fan Wooh's
mother who had been barbarically tortured to death by the hated
westerners.&nbsp; She preferred, and&nbsp; consequently
was, referred to by the first part of her name, Peony. 

Peony told Zhaing how she wanted Mei Ling
trussed.&nbsp; Zhaing moved to the spread&nbsp; Mei Ling and sneered in satisfaction at the terrible
bondage he had placed her in.&nbsp; Her luscious form is already quite
invitingly displayed but to facilitate the desires of the &quot;Princess&quot;,
and his own savage intentions, he will gleefully bind her in a different
manner. Quickly he releases her arms which fall slackly to her sides.&nbsp; He
removes the bindings holding her legs, which had been spread horizontally and
tries to stand her on her feet, but all feeling and strength has drained from
them and they will not support her, she collapses to her knees on the concrete
floor.&nbsp; He leaves the terrible hooks distorting her mouth and nose in
place, her head twisted back, her face a grotesque mask of pain and
terror.&nbsp; 

Since she is already on her knees it is a simple matter to double her legs
back, binding ankles to upper thighs, the muscles cramping and rebelling after
the wide spreading of her legs. Her arms are twisted in back and crossed so
that right hand pokes around her waist on the left and her left hand on the
right.&nbsp; A thin leather thong is bound around each wrist and pulled tight
across her waist&nbsp; The binding is very tight and will cut into the flesh if
she struggles, as she most assuredly will under the tortures she is about to be
subjected too. A stout bamboo rod is forced between her underarms and back This has the desired effect of thrusting her large breasts
up and forward, her body bowed.&nbsp; It also strains her shoulder joints. In
this position, the sinews and tendons scream out in anguish as they are
stretched and twisted.&nbsp; A spreader bar is bound between her knees to keep
her legs splayed. A pair of chains are lowered and attached to the ends of the
bamboo rod. Zhaing moves to the wall and turns a
crank, the chains rise and Mei Ling is lifted up to dangle above the floor, the
pain as the bamboo buries itself into the crook of her armpits lances through
her shoulders, intense and searing.&nbsp; The spread of the chains keeps her
from turning about. 

The nose hook is removed and her lustrous long black hair is bound with a cord
and pulled tightly down and tied to the bamboo rod,&nbsp;
ensuring her head remains bent sharply back, her only view that of the
darkness above, beyond the harsh glare of the lights focused on each of the
tormented women. 

Peony hands a leather mask to Zhaing who removes the
terrible mouth hooks....&nbsp; Mei Ling moans in anguish and relief at the
release of the pressure on her mouth and cheeks, she is barely able to move her
jaws. No matter,&nbsp; Zhaing
places the mask over Mei Ling's face, it covers her face from just below the
eyes to under her chin.&nbsp; A funnel like tube on it's
underside is forced into her mouth and down her throat.&nbsp; Straps go around
her head and buckle in back.. Next soft rubber plugs
are forced into her nostrils. Mei Ling gags and gasps for air. The only way she
is able to breathe is through the leather funnel violating her mouth and
throat.&nbsp; She wriggles and grunts as her brain frantically casts about in
mounting terror as to what they intend.

Mei Ling's eyes bulge in terror as Peony smiles down at her.

&quot;Now tell us....Where has that miserable pig of a Son
in Law gone! Nod your head if you wish to unburden yourself and save&nbsp; the trouble of going further.&nbsp; Refuse and I
assure you I will experience pain beyond measure.&quot;

Mei Ling, terrified and frantic with fear tries to speak but only
unintelligible babble emerges from the mask, her head shaking.

&quot;I take that as a no!&quot;

A large barrel, filled with water, is trundled across the concrete to Mei
Ling's side.&nbsp; Peony nods to Zhaing and steps
aside.&nbsp; 

Zhaing removes a large pitcher from the side of the
barrel and dips it into the water.&nbsp; Holding it over the broad funnel like
opening in the leather mask, he tips it up and begins pouring the contents into
the funnel.&nbsp; Mei Ling sputters and chokes, spitting out as much as she is
able.&nbsp; Zhaing fills the funnel. It isn't long
before Mei Ling has no choice, swallow or suffocate.&nbsp; She opens her throat
to gasp for air and is forced to swallow.&nbsp; Water gurgles into her throat
as she struggles to empty the funnel and get air into her lungs. Sputtering and
gasping she finally gulps the water in the funnel,&nbsp; her
chest heaving as she gasps for air.&nbsp; 

Zhaing tips the pitcher again filling the funnel
again as Mei Ling desperately ingests it in order to breathe. This is repeated
again and again. Her stomach&nbsp; swells as more and
more water is forced into her. Her belly is distended like a woman in advanced
pregnancy, the skin taught and shining.

Peony hands Zhaing a bamboo cane. Taking a stance to
one side of Mei Ling he taps it lightly on her swollen abdomen.&nbsp; Drawing
back his arm he slashes the cane across the tightly stretched flesh of her
bulging midsection.

SSSWWWWAAACCCCCCKKKK!!!

Again

SSSWWAAACCKKKKKKKKK!!!!

SSWWWWWACCCCCCCCCCKKKKKK!!!

A terrible screech of agony bursts from the leather funnel jammed into Mei
Ling's stretched mouth.

&quot;EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!!&quot;

Zhaing slashes the cane across Mei Ling's rounded
belly over and over.&nbsp; Each new blow followed by unearthly howling which
erupts from the savage mask covering her face.&nbsp; Peony lays a hand on Zhaing's arm and exchanges the cane for a substantial
bamboo rod.&nbsp; 

He turns back to Mei Ling.&nbsp; She shakes her head frantically, babbling
through the mask, her eyes bulging in terror.&nbsp;&nbsp; Zhaing
brings the bamboo cudgel forward viciously, slamming it into the taught mound
of her stomach.&nbsp; 

TWWAAAAPPPP!!!

TTWWWWAAAAAAPPPPP!!

Shrieks of unendurable agony issue from the mask on Mei Ling's face.&nbsp;
Water spouts from the funnel with each blow of the&nbsp;
ferocious rod.&nbsp; The barbaric beating goes on until nothing but a
dribble of bile bubbles from the mask.

Peony once again goes to Mei Ling, and looking into the tormented eyes asks the
question.&nbsp; Mei Ling babbles and shakes her head as she tries to convey
that she does not have the answer.&nbsp; 

Peony steps back and raises her hand, motioning for Zhaing
to resume the torture.

Mei Ling struggles and shakes her head as the pitiless fiend again pours water
into the funnel.&nbsp; Gradually Mei Ling's belly bulges further and further
till it is again fit to burst. Zhaing takes up his
cudgel and beats Mei Ling's distended abdomen pounding the water from
her.&nbsp; It then begins yet again.&nbsp; It is repeated over and over during
the passage of more than an hour and a half.&nbsp; Mei Ling wails and screams
constantly as she is forced to ingest water and is savagely pummeled.

Fan Wooh sits nearby in his ornate chair, watching
with undisguised lust and pleasure, the barbaric torture of this unfortunate
woman.&nbsp; 

He beacons to Peony, &quot;Perhaps a little change in methods will loosen their
tongues.&quot;

&quot;Of course father.&nbsp; Do you have anything in particular you would
like?&quot;

&quot;Yes. The prod I think. It always elicits quite pleasurable
screaming.&nbsp; No need to change her position.&quot;

&quot;Excellent suggestion father.I think Zhaing needs a rest, he has
been working very diligently. I personally will conduct this part of her
questioning&quot;

Tsu Ming has watched the hideous torture of her
mother and pleads with Fan Wooh to stop the fiendish
torture.&nbsp; Her mother knows nothing.

&quot;Tell us where your traitorous husband is!&quot;

&quot;I tell you I do not know his whereabouts. Neither do my sister or mother..&nbsp; Please you must believe me.&quot;

&quot;You lie!&nbsp; I will continue the application of means to persuade one
of you to give up this foolish loyalty to that pig.&nbsp; All of you will
suffer for your stubborn refusal.&nbsp; Get on with it most illustrious
daughter.&quot;

&quot;With great pleasure father.&quot;

Peon has Zhaing remove the vicious leather mask from
Mei Ling's face, then releases her hair, allowing her
to nod her head forward for the first time in hours.&nbsp; Mei Ling is still
gasping and shuddering from her water torture ordeal. She hangs from the vile bamboo
pole under her arms.&nbsp; It burrows ever deeper, causing excruciating pain to
her arms and shoulders.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

Please!&nbsp; Oh Please! Stop this torment.&nbsp; I do not have the information
you ask for.&nbsp; Please! Have mercy!&quot;

&quot;As my father says, You Lie!.&nbsp; 

Peony goes to one of the many large cabinets lining the walls of this hellish
chamber.&nbsp; Opening a large door she removes a black baton 3 feet
long.&nbsp; On one end two shiny prongs curve out like the horns of a
goat.&nbsp; The other end is an insulated handle&nbsp; with
a dial at the tip and a red button where ones thumb would rest.&nbsp; She
returns to Mei Ling and pointing it at her asks if she knows what it is.

Dumb struck Mei Ling shakes her head.

&quot;The western barbarians call it a cattle prod.&nbsp; It is used to shock
cattle to get them to move as they want. I press this little button and a large
charge of electricity passes between the prongs you see on the end.&nbsp; By
way of&nbsp; illustration she depresses the button and
a brilliant blue/white flame arcs between the prongs. I will touch very
sensitive places on your body. It will send a surge of electricity into that
place when I press the button.&nbsp; I will continue doing it until you tell me
what I want. I can keep on indefinitely. You will beg for the water treatment
to be resumed.&nbsp; Now!&nbsp; Tell me what I want!&quot;

&quot;Please I beg you, don't do this.&nbsp; I don't know the answer to your
question.&nbsp; If I did I would tell all, but I don't know!&quot;

&quot;You may bring an end to it at any time by telling me what I ask!&quot;

&quot;NOooooooo!&nbsp; Please! NOooooooo!
&quot;

Peony touches the prod to Mei Ling's battered, tormented, and quivering belly
but does not activate it.&nbsp; She moves it down between her wide splayed
thighs and inserts it between the plump lips.&nbsp; Down the insides if her
thighs.&nbsp; She slides it up the side of her torso and over her neck behind
the ear.&nbsp; All the time prodding but she doesn't press the button.&nbsp;
Down into the valley between Mei Ling's lush bulging breasts, up and over the
globes pausing over a nipple, grinning and smirking at Mei Ling as she flinches
and jerks, knowing that at any moment the electricity may surge from the prongs
to sear her flesh. 

Peony lowers the point of the prod to Mei Ling&quot;s
navel.&nbsp; 

ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZTTT!!!&nbsp;&nbsp; a flash of
blue/white crackles and 20,000 volts 
of electricity leaps between the prongs.&nbsp; She holds the button down, the
voltage scouring a path across the vibrating flesh.&nbsp; 

&quot;AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRR!!!!!&quot;

Peony holds the button as she drags the prongs across shuddering muscles as Mei
Ling thrashes and convulses in the throes of the electricity, her body tense
and staining against her bindings. Her muscles twitch and contract
involuntarily in reaction to the electric charge. Finally Peony lifts her
finger and draws the prod back.

Mei Ling continues to convulse and tremble.

Peony looks to Mei Ling, a raised eyebrow asking &quot;WELL?&quot;

&quot;I do not know. I do not know!&nbsp; Please!&nbsp; No more.&nbsp;
Please.&quot;

Peony reaches out with the prod and touches under a breast, drawing a circle
around it, up and across the curved mound to the large stiff pinnacle at it's crest.&nbsp; The prongs either side of the large erect
nipple.

ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT!!!!!!!

&quot;NNNNNNNNNNNNNGGGGGGGGGGGGAAAAAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRRR!!!!!&quot;

ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZTTTTTTTTTTTTT!!!!!!!

&quot;AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHRRRRR!!!!&quot;

Mei Ling's breast seems to explode as the powerful charge blasts through the
huge nipple and tears into the quaking flesh, convulsing and jumping as the
nerves are seared, jolting and leaping as her entire body shudders and
vibrates.&nbsp; Her screams reverberate through Fan Wooh's
den of pain and torture.&nbsp; They go on and on, rising in pitch and intensity
as Peony holds Mei Ling in unspeakable agony.

Tsu Ming screams in frustration to stop.&nbsp; 

&quot;If she will not talk then YOU tell us what we want, or I will continue
playing with your precious mother!&quot;

&quot;She doesn't know the answer to what you ask!&quot;

&quot;I will continue until one of you tells me.&quot;

&quot;We DO NOT KNOW!!!&quot;

Peony lowers the prod toward Mei Ling's splayed thighs.

PART 7

Peony maneuvers the prongs of the prod so they are bestride the pouting lips of
Mei Ling's quivering pussy.&nbsp; 

&quot;A last chance to tell us where the vermin is hiding!&quot;

&quot;Please I beg you, no more!&nbsp; I do not know the answer you
request.&quot;

ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT!!!!!

&quot;AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRR!!!!!&quot;

Twisting the prod Peony slides the terrible metal prongs between the plump
lips.

&quot;Nooooooo!&nbsp;&nbsp; I do not know!!!&nbsp;&nbsp; I do not know!&quot;

ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT!!!

&quot;EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYIIIIIIIIIIII !!!!!!&quot;

The piercing jolts of electricity stab through the soft, yielding flesh of Mei
Ling's most intimate place, one electrode touching her now swollen clitoris.
The savage power tears through the tortured core, a wisp of smoke curls up as
it seems to explode in a sheet of pain, like a knife slicing up into her
heaving abdomen.&nbsp; Mei Ling screams in excruciating agony, her body
futilely convulsing and shuddering.&nbsp; 

Peony lays the prod aside and searches through her collection of toys.&nbsp;
She finds what she is looking for and turns to Tsu Ming.&nbsp; Peony has taken
over the torture of the three women.

Fan Wooh orders Zhaing to release Tsu Ming from her rigid bondage and instructs
him how he wishes her bound for the depredations his sweet daughter intends for
Tsu Ming. As the cruel straps binding her legs doubled under her are removed,
the circulation, so long restricted returns and the muscles of her legs seize
and cramp, twitching, pain flashes up and down her lush thighs.&nbsp; Her arms
shudder and quiver as they too are freed, the joints of her shoulders causing
terrible jolts of piercing agony lancing through them.&nbsp; Zhaing has to
support her as he manhandles her between two steel columns under several chains
dangling from overhead.&nbsp; A heavy iron collar, with&nbsp; rings welded at
the sides, in front and back, is locked about her slender neck.&nbsp; One of
the chains is lowered and a hook on the end hooked into one of the side
rings.&nbsp; Zhaing cranks the chain upwards, twisting and stretching Tsu
Ming's neck until she is lifted to her toes.&nbsp; Steel cuffs are locked
around her wrists and chains&nbsp; extend from them to winches on the steel
posts.&nbsp; These are tightened, her arms stretched painfully out to either
side. Her legs are not left unfettered either.&nbsp; Cuffs around each ankle
are fastened by chains to rings on the lower insides of the columns. Zhaing now
turns the crank on the chain connected to the collar about her neck.&nbsp; Tsu
Ming is lifted further, the cruel iron cutting under her chin and the side of
her neck, her head twisted to one side.&nbsp; He continues raising her until
her arms and legs are stretched taut.

Fan Wooh stands before her, looking into Tsu Ming's terrified eyes.&nbsp; She
is spread eagled, stretched tightly for whatever monstrous torture Peony contemplates.

&quot;You look enchanting&nbsp; foolish girl.&nbsp; Why not abandon this ill
advised loyalty to your pig of a husband. Tell me where he is hiding, while you
and your family are suffering the consequences of his seditious actions.&quot;

&quot;I cannot tell you what I do not know!&nbsp; You must believe me!&nbsp;
None of us have any knowledge of any rebellious activities by him, nor where he
may have gone!&quot;

&quot;I do not believe you!&nbsp; You not only know where he has gone but you
and your family here are part of the entire affair!&nbsp; I will extract this
information from one of you!&nbsp; Number One daughter; see what you can do to
convince this foolish person to reveal what she knows.&nbsp; I wish to hear her
scream!&quot;

&quot;Yes father.&nbsp; You will soon hear the melodious strains of unspeakable
agony issuing forth as I play with her.&nbsp; You have taught me well.&quot;

Peony lifts the implement she had retrieved from her collection of
instruments.&nbsp; It appears to be a small cordless drill with a pistol like
handle, however it has a more devious use.&nbsp; It has no means to hold a
drill but has a long screwdriver like rod protruding from the business
end.&nbsp; The end has a silvery-gray tint to it.&nbsp; She holds it up in
front of Tsu Ming's face and squeezes the trigger.&nbsp; A small red LED
illuminates and in a very few moments a curl of smoke rises from the tip.&nbsp;
Tsu Ming's eyes&nbsp; widen and bulge from her face as she realizes what Peony
holds, a cordless soldering iron.&nbsp; Keeping her finger on the trigger Peony
moves the tip close to Tsu Ming's face, twisted sideways as it is,&nbsp; tracing
a path near her nose, across her cheek and down the side of her neck keeping
the smoldering point scant millimeters from her cringing flesh.&nbsp; Down over
the swelling mounds of her voluptuous breasts, circling the stiff nipples,
downward, skimming so close to the ribs standing in sharp relief on Tsu Ming's
taut torso.&nbsp; Around the mound at the jointure of her widely spread
thighs.&nbsp; 

&quot;Where first? Hmmmm?&nbsp; Where shall I burn you first little one?&nbsp;
That is what I'm going to do you know.&nbsp; I'm going to burn and sear your
flawless ivory flesh with the glowing, smoking end of this
instrument.&nbsp;&nbsp; I will trace paths over your body.&nbsp; Wherever I
feel it will bring the most pain.&nbsp; You will shriek and scream, begging for
me to stop.&nbsp; The only way to stop the terrible pain will be to tell my
father what he wishes.&nbsp; Do you wish to save yourself this tremendous
pain?&quot;

&quot;I beg you, please have mercy.&nbsp; I do not know where my husband is. If
I did I would tell you, but, I do not know!!&quot;

&quot;Foolish girl you lie!&nbsp; Now my little friend here is going to show
you how foolish.&quot;

&quot;Nooo,,,&nbsp;&nbsp; Nooo!!&nbsp; I'll do anything you want, but I cannot
tell you what I do not know!!!&quot;

Fan Wooh smiles in pitiless satisfaction and nods to his demonic offspring.

Peony glides around the lovely figure before her, stopping at her back.&nbsp;
Tsu Ming tries to follow her with her eyes but she hangs suspended by the
brutal collar about her neck, her head twisted to one side.&nbsp; She hears
Peony stop behind her, her body tenses, will Peony sear the iron into her someplace
back there?&nbsp; But of course!

Peony lightly touches a fleeting brush of the shimmering point of the iron at
the very top of Tsu Ming's spine.&nbsp; Tsu Ming jerks away as best she
can.&nbsp; Peony giggles as her victim quivers in terror, the muscles of her
back twitching in anticipation of the next touch. 

&quot;My, my, a bit tense are we?&quot;

&quot;Please nooo!&nbsp; Pleasseee!&nbsp; Noooooooo!!!&quot;

A wolfish smirk on her face Peony places the tip of the hot iron to the exact
spot she just left.&nbsp; This time maintaining contact with the smooth ivory
flesh.&nbsp; Tsu Ming stiffens, every muscle in her body straining, trembling.

&quot;YYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYEEEEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!!!&quot;

Peony keeps the iron against the valley between the shoulder blades, carefully,
slowly drawing it downward.&nbsp; Slowly, slowly till the smoking point reaches
the cleft of Tsu Ming's bottom globes.&nbsp; Her howl of agony rings from the
walls and ceiling of the torture chamber, her body bent in a taut bow in an
effort to pull away from the ferocious, burning point, the cruel collar biting
into her twisted neck.&nbsp; The scream trails to a wailing moan of agony.
Peony touches the top of a shoulder, drawing a path of searing pain down and
across the outraged muscles of Tsu Ming's back, ending on the opposite hip from
the shoulder.&nbsp; The shrieks of excruciating agony cascade from Tsu Ming's
wide stretched mouth. Now the same on the opposite side. The screams quaver and
rise.&nbsp; Peony walks around in front of her prey, smiling.

&quot;Are we having a good time my little one?&quot;

&quot;No More!&nbsp; No More!&nbsp; Please have mercy!&nbsp; No more!!!&quot;

&quot;Why of course!&nbsp; Talk!&quot;

&quot;I DON'T KNOW!!!!&nbsp; I DON'T KNOW!!!&nbsp; Please stop!&nbsp; No
more!!&quot;

Peony steps close and looks into the wildly terrified eyes darting about,
looking for respite, mercy, anything to stop the unending pain.

&quot;I think I shall strip the skin from these stiff nubbins here.&quot;

She flicks a nipple with her free hand.&nbsp; Tsu Ming twists and tries to
shake her head, her eyes bulging in terror as she looks down at her taut
breasts with their pointed peaks.

&quot;Noooooooooooo!!!&quot;

Peony smiles, nodding her head and lifts one sumptuous mound in her hand.

&quot;Ohh YESSSSSSS!&quot;

Peony touches the point to the edge of the aureole and slowly drags the
scorching tip across to the upstanding nipple, up over the erect point, down
and the rest of the way across the aureole.&nbsp; A shriek so loud and shrill
Zhaing, used to much screaming, covers his ears.&nbsp; Peony is delighted, she
touches the tip to a spot next to where she has just stripped the skin from the
shuddering breast.&nbsp; Another horrific howl of agony bursts forth from Tsu
Ming.&nbsp; Peony slowly and meticulously works her way around the shuddering
point, flaying the skin from the nipple, now shiny and weeping where the skin
was been stripped away.&nbsp; The screams pause only long enough for Tsu Ming
to gasp air into her lungs and scream again.&nbsp; The piercing, stabbing pain
seems to drive into her body to her very core. She shakes and shudders,&nbsp;
futilely struggling to deal with the outrageous pain.&nbsp; It bores into her
brain, surely pain such as this has never been endured by a human before. If
only the savage collar would sever her head and end the torment.

Peony is obviously enjoying herself immensely as she finishes striping the last
of the skin from the nipple.&nbsp; Letting the once beautiful, full breast
slide from her hand,&nbsp; she reaches to and cradles it's twin.&nbsp; Tsu Ming
wriggles her head, screaming, &quot;NOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!&quot;
Peony's face is a mask of pure unadulterated delight as she prepares to flay
the twin of the swollen nipple she has already burned. She places the tip to
the nipple.

&quot;NNNNNNNNNNNNNNOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!&nbsp;
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRRHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!&quot;

It takes Peony 20 minutes to strip the skin from the large nubbin.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Tsu Ming's shrieks go on and on.&nbsp; Her body is one great shuddering,
quaking, piece of tortured flesh.&nbsp; Muscles spasm and convulse, sinews
strained to the breaking point as Peony plays her hideous game.&nbsp; She steps
back to admire her work, smiling evilly.&nbsp; She looks to Fan Wooh who nods
his head and smiles approvingly.&nbsp; 

&quot;You do well my daughter.&nbsp; Please go on with your very talented
demonstration.&quot;

&quot;It will be a great pleasure father.&nbsp; Let me move on to even more
engaging diversions.&quot;

PART 8


&quot;Are you ready to speak to me my foolish child?&nbsp; I intend to continue
this&nbsp; game with my hot toy indefinitely you
know.&quot;

&quot;I do not know the information you want. Please I beg you stop!&nbsp; The
pain!&nbsp; I can't take anymore.&quot;

&quot;I know, it hurts so, but as long as you refuse to reveal where your
treacherous pig of a husband has gone it will continue. I have many more
methods to use when I tire of using this.&quot;

&quot;Mercy!&nbsp; I beg you!&nbsp; I do not know. I'll do anything!&nbsp; If I
knew where he was I would tell you and end this.&nbsp; I DO NOT KNOW!!!&quot;

&quot;You leave me not choice.&nbsp; Prepare yourself.&nbsp; It is going to get
worse, much worse&quot;

Peony depressed the trigger on the iron.&nbsp; Quickly the tip started smoking,
the terrible point glowing a dull, then shimmering
orange.&nbsp; She touched the tip to Tsu Ming's taut
ribcage just under a breast.&nbsp; A hiss and a curl of smoke from burning
flesh rose as she held it motionless a few seconds, then slowly drew the
searing point across and down the center of Tsu
Ming's quivering torso, circling her navel, across under the ribs and up again
over the ridges where the muscles were stretched tight over the curved bones
beneath.&nbsp; A piercing shriek of agony was flung from her mouth, bouncing
from the walls and circling the terrible room.&nbsp; Peony continued drawing
designs over the surface of her taut stomach, each touch and movement eliciting
a escalating wail of screams and howls of untold
agony.&nbsp; 

Peony&nbsp; paused and watched the convulsing,
shuddering muscles and flesh as Tsu Ming, hanging by
the monstrous iron collar with her arms and legs spread wide thrashed and shook
in agony. A malevolent smile enveloped Peony's exquisite face. 

Tsu Ming's
body shuddered and quaked, her breasts burning with fire, her flayed nipples
raw and weeping.&nbsp; Tsu Ming whimpered and
begged, pleading for mercy.

Fan Wooh stepped close to the savagely tormented
girl,

&quot;Talk you stupid girl or the pain will get worse, your little sister will
again be a source of entertainment for me, all because none of you will tell me
what I wish to know!&quot;

&quot;We do not know the answer you demand sir. We do not know!&quot;

&quot;Very well then. Zhaing
see what you can do to loosen the tongue of the young one over there.&quot;

Eager to get back into the torture of these beauteous women, Zhaing hustles to Su Wei still slowly swinging to and fro
at the end of the ropes about her breasts, now a deep dark, almost
black purple.&nbsp; She moans and wails continually,
sure her breasts will be torn from her at any moment. 

Zhaing removes the weights hanging from her feet,
then grasps an ankle,&nbsp; Su Wei sobs in agony as he
doubles it back under her and straps the ankle up under her thigh.&nbsp;
Enjoying her cries he does the same with the other ankle. Su Wei now appears to
be kneeling on empty air. Zhaing lowers her till her
knees brush the chamber floor but before any of the weight is relieved he
raises her an inch or two clear of the floor. 

Going to the wall he picks through the whips, flails and scourges till he finds
what he wants.&nbsp; A thin bamboo cane.&nbsp;
Returning to Su Wei he swishes it back and forth a few&nbsp;
times then taps each breast, bringing cries of anguish from the young
victim.&nbsp; Continuing the tapping of the bulging globes of
breast flesh, each tap a bit more forceful.&nbsp; The blows do not just sting, they bore deeply into the swollen flesh, cutting like
a blade into the sensitized mounds bulging like two large balloons.&nbsp; Su
Wei screams in pain as the tapping sears into her flesh.&nbsp; 

Stepping back and a bit to one side Zhaing draws his
arm across his body and with a wicked backhanded stroke, using his considerable
strength, smashes the thin cane across both breasts.&nbsp; If her breasts were
unbound the shaft&nbsp; would have disappeared into the normally soft resilient
breast flesh, but bound tightly as they were they were two globes of taught,
engorged muscle.&nbsp; The fierce some weapon cut into the hard engorged flesh.
A shriek of awesome agony burst from Su Wei's mouth, blood sprayed from the
terrible wound in her breasts. 

AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHRRRRRRRRRRRRRR!!!!!!!

Zhaing dealt another fearsome blow from the other
side, cutting across both grotesquely swollen nipples cutting them horribly.

GGGGGGGGGGGGGGAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!!!

Zhaing continued belaboring Su Wei's twisting body,
working his way from the tortured breasts,&nbsp; across
her tautly stretched torso, cutting the insides of her thighs and the tender
bulge of her crotch.

The howls of unearthly agony beat on everyone's ear drums and bounded from the
walls as she vented her agonizing despair at the vicious beating being
administered by her tormentor. Zhaing continued the
unremitting flogging, her screams now a constant wail
of terror and agony.

Zhaing lowers two chains from overhead and fastens
the hooks on the ends around the ends of the rod laced between her arms and
back.&nbsp; Slowly he raises the chains and the weight of her body is gradually
transferred from her tits.&nbsp; Next he carefully unwinds the fastenings bound
around the bases of her breasts&nbsp; Blood rushes
into the swollen globes of her now freed breasts.&nbsp; In a few moments the
returning circulation causes pain of unbelievable proportions, eclipsing the
horrific agony of her suspension by her massive breasts.

EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII!!!!!!!

The searing pain shoots thru the lacerated and bleeding mounds as Su Wei tosses
her head side to&nbsp; side in excruciating
agony.&nbsp; Her breath comes in heaving gasps between screams.

&quot;In heavens name Tsu Ming tell him what he
wishes to know.&quot;

&quot;Forgive me little sister but I tell the truth when I say I do not
know.&nbsp; If it were in my power to stop this torment I would.&quot;

Zhaing rolled another of his playthings over to Su
Wei, positioning it between her spread thighs.&nbsp; It was a slender ivory
post standing 2ft tall.&nbsp; The top end was shaped like a male organ in full
erection, the head large and bulbous.&nbsp; It was some two inches in diameter
at the head but rapidly tapering out below that.&nbsp; A lever on the&nbsp; side actuated a ratchet so the entire affair could be
raised or lowered. Zhaing reached to a tub of lard on
the table and scooping up a good handful smeared it over the head&nbsp; and upper shaft of the ivory phallus.&nbsp; Turning
the&nbsp; winch connected to the overhead chains Zhaing lowered Su Wei till the head of the device nestled
at the entrance to her most private grotto.&nbsp; Using his fingers Zhaing parted the lips of her treasure allowing the smooth
knob to slip inside.&nbsp; He, uncharacteristically, gently massaged the plump
lips of Su Wei's opened pussy and his fat fingers spread the lubricant in the
valley around the intricately carved shaft, working up to the hooded center of
her femininity, nudging back the covering and softly titillating the bud of her
clitoris, brining it to life as it reddened and swelled.&nbsp; In spite of the
inhuman tortures she had undergone, to her horror&nbsp; she
felt herself stimulated and her of own natural juices began to flow, further
lubricating the ivory invader.&nbsp; Once he felt her responding, he reached
down to the side of the device and moved the handle up and down, it operated
like a lifting jack and the knarled column rose up
sliding into her most sensitive tunnel, the shaft growing thicker as it
rose.&nbsp;&nbsp; Further and further it penetrated her, finally bumping her
cervix, spreading it open, clearing the path to her
womb which it soon penetrated.&nbsp; She&nbsp; felt as
if she were splitting in two, the now fat pole more than 3 inches in diameter,
stretching her orifice.

&quot;I'm going to ask you again where your husband is.&nbsp; Each time you
refuse, Zhaing will raise the instrument one
notch.&nbsp; It&nbsp; will push further and further
into your sisters gap.&nbsp; Eventually it will burst through her inner
space.&nbsp; It's rounded end will not pierce vital
organs but will shunt them aside as it rises inside her.&nbsp; Through and
around the loops of her intestines, pushing aside her stomach, rising between
her lungs, slipping by alongside her so&nbsp; vital heart, finally penetrating
her esophagus, sliding up her throat and will then protrude from her
mouth.&nbsp; All this will occur as she lives and feels the slithering shaft
sliding through her body.&nbsp; She will experience pain beyond
comprehension.&nbsp; She will not be granted the escape of death but will
suffer in untold agony for days. And YOU will watch as she writhes and squirms,
impaled and trying to scream.&nbsp; Your mother will be next.&nbsp; I have
another treat in store for her which you will watch as she slowly expires under
my diabolical tortures.&quot;

&quot;By the names of my ancestors I beg you stop!&nbsp; I do not know the
answer you seek!&nbsp; Have mercy, I beg you, please have mercy!&quot;

Fan Wooh turns to Zhaing
and nods his head.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click!

Fan Wooh turns back to Tsu
Ming a satanically leer on hiss face.

&quot;Speak, before irreparable harm comes to your little sister.&quot;

&quot;I cannot!&nbsp; I DO NOT KNOW!!!!&quot;

Fan Wooh nods again.&nbsp; Click.&nbsp; Su Wei
squirms and tries to pull herself up, a groan escaping from her lips.

&quot;Hmmmmm?&quot;

&quot;STOP!!!!!&nbsp; I DON&quot;T KNOWWWWW!&quot;

&quot;Continue Zhaing. Each time she refuses, give
our little lotus blossom a bit more stimulation.&quot;

Click!!!&nbsp; A whimper and moan from Su Wei.

&quot;Stop!&nbsp; It hurts!&nbsp; Stop!&quot;

&quot;My dear?&quot;

&quot;I DON&quot;T KNOWWW!!!!! Stop!&nbsp; I'll do whatever you wish
just STOP! But I don't know where my husband is.&nbsp; You must believe
me.&nbsp; Please STOP!&quot;

&quot;You lie! Watch as Zhaing raises your sisters
artificial lover, as it pushes it's way through her
body, she will experience something only a few unfortunates have endured, pain
beyond imagination.&quot;

Click!&nbsp; AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRREEEEEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!!!!!

Su Wei writhes and squirms as the monstrous shaft slowly worms it's fiendish way through her inner body.&nbsp; Her howls
and screams of unearthly agony bounce from the walls of the chamber of terror
and pain. She begs and pleads for death but Fan Wooh
tells her only her beloved sister can stop the pain.&nbsp; Tsu
Ming begs and weeps for the outrageous torment to cease.&nbsp; No matter&nbsp; what they do she cannot reveal what she doesn't
know.&nbsp; Click.
Su Wei vents her agony in explosive screams and shrieks as the fiendish shaft
works it's way upward. They are utterly helpless in
the hands of possibly the most fiendish torturer of all time.&nbsp;
Click!&nbsp; 

EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Sue Wei's scream dies to a gurgle as the bloodied tip of the hellish machine
begins to emerge from her wide stretched mouth, blood and spittle foaming out
around the hideous head to dribble and drool down her chin, flowing between her
once beautiful but now odiously scared breasts, She continues to writhe and
struggle, gasping for air around the shaft of the impaling device.&nbsp; Her
pitiable wails of agony gurgle from her lips, her head
perpetually bent back the head of the machine protruding grotesquely from her
mouth.&nbsp; She will indeed live for a considerable length of time in
unspeakable agony as her mother and sister look on&nbsp;
helplessly .&nbsp; 

&quot;Still stubborn hmmm?&nbsp; So we will move on to&nbsp; your whore of a mother and see what you have to say
as I personally display my knowledge of persuasion. Her screams will be a sweet
accompaniment to your sisters agonized moans and screams as she slowly dies.

PART 9 


Zhaing turns to Mei Ling where she hangs.&nbsp; He lowers her and removes her
bindings.&nbsp; She is so weak and exhausted from her ordeal she cannot
stand.....&nbsp; Zhaing twists his fingers in her hair and drags her across the
floor, dropping her between two posts which rise up from the floor about two
feet.&nbsp; He spreads her legs and secures them to the posts by short chains,
using the iron shackles already around her ankles.&nbsp; 

Retrieving the mouth hook he had employed earlier, he places it into her mouth
and draws the strap tight.&nbsp;&nbsp; Her mouth again takes on&nbsp; the
distorted, previous twisted appearance, lips drawn back over her teeth.&nbsp; 

Peony hands him a head cage. Zhaing places it over Mei Ling's head and locks it
in place.&nbsp; One band fits snugly around her neck, another across the bridge
of her nose , a third across her forehead. The vertical bands fit closely to
the sides of her head, curving up to join at the top in a heavy ring.&nbsp;
Zhaing pulls down a chain from overhead and hooks it into the ring.&nbsp; 

There is a nose hook inside the cage and Zhaing inserts it into her nostrils,
pulling it tight and tying it off to the back of the cage.&nbsp; Mei Ling's
face is once more wrenched into a hideous mask by the vicious hooks in nose and
mouth. 

Peony&nbsp; turns a crank by the wall and the chain rises pulling Mei Ling
upright.&nbsp; Zhaing twists her arms behind her, strapping her wrists
together, elbows touching.&nbsp; Mei Ling wails as her arms are twisted back,
surely this time they will be wrenched from their sockets.&nbsp; Peony again turns
the crank on the wall.

Mei Ling is lifted by the cage imprisoning her head, the band around her throat
bites cruelly into her neck&nbsp; under her chin. She moans and attempts to
twist, it feels as if her head is being torn from her body.&nbsp; 

When her feet are even with the tops of the posts Peony halts.&nbsp; Zhaing
unfastens the short chains on her ankles and links 
them directly to the tops of the posts.&nbsp; Peony now lowers Mei Ling. As she
drops lower and lower her feet spread further and further her legs pulled
sideways.&nbsp; The strain on her hips is tremendous as her feet rise higher
and higher till her legs extend outward at 90 degrees to her body.&nbsp; 

Zhaing turns to Tsu Ming.

&quot;Unless you tell me the truth about your husband, Zhaing will lower your
mother until her legs are wrenched from her hip sockets, muscles and tendons
will tear asunder.&nbsp; The pain will be insufferable, she will believe red
hot irons have been forced into the sockets. The muscles will be sundered from
their moorings, rupturing and shredding. She will be a cripple, unable to even
walk.

While this is happening Zhaing will find additional&nbsp; ways to keep me
amused as he rends her body in pieces.&nbsp; It will not be pleasant. The
screams of excruciating agony will bounce from the walls.&nbsp; She will shriek
and beg for release.&nbsp;&nbsp; Only you can stop it.&nbsp; Now Tell me!&quot;

&quot;Please, you must believe me! I do not know where my husband is! &quot;

&quot;So be it foolish girl!&nbsp; Zhaing, please continue!&quot;

Peony has handed Zhaing one of his favorite whips, a one inch wide lather strap
5 ft long.&nbsp; He raises his arm and lashes out with all his might.&nbsp; The
leather whistles through the air slashing&nbsp; full across Mei Ling's breasts,
cutting just below the nipples, an angry red weal rising where it has cut.
Another horrific blow slashes on the under side of those beauteous globes.

AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR!!!!!!!!

We leave&nbsp; this unfortunate family to your imagination and travel to an
earlier time, the turn of the century and the Boxer rebellion. We may return at
some other time.

The Americans, the British and the rest of the international cabal who had
defeated the abortive Chinese attempt to expel them&nbsp; dealt very harshly
with the defeated Chinese.

Severe and heinous restrictions and penalties had been imposed and while
defeated, the Chinese were still quite rebellious against the rules and
circumvented them at every turn.&nbsp; The consequence was swift and terrible
retribution&nbsp; by the foreigners. They made considerable use of the Chinese
own countrymen to accomplish this&nbsp; 

The Chinese had always been noted for their ingenious and terrible methods of
extracting information and confessions.&nbsp; The Inquisition of the Catholic
Church paled in comparison.
&nbsp; 
Sing Foo and his ancestors had employed for centuries as the finest and
cruelest torturers in a land which celebrated refined and barbarous
torture.&nbsp; They were particularly admired for some of the ingenious and
terrible methods employed on female subjects.

One Lan Tei was the beautiful wife of Jan Wang,&nbsp; one of the most notorious
and influential merchants of Peiping. She also was&nbsp; the mother of a
son.&nbsp; Fan Wooh! Wang being his father. Fan Wooh was not in Peiping at the
time of the incident related here.

Wang was know as a devious and unscrupulous bargainer, using any means at his
command to achieve his ends, the amassing of huge sums of money and valuable
ancient Chinese treasures.&nbsp; He was a very large thorn in the side of those
who now controlled the international comings and goings of everything moving
into, out of and within China. 

It was the desire of these defacto rulers to bring to heel any and all
traffickers of all commodities and aspects of Chinese life. As stated he was a
thorn in their side and must be brought to heel.&nbsp; The Chinese had nothing
to say in governing their own country. It was in fact run by the cabal of the
victorious. 

To solve the problem with Wang they could easily&nbsp; arrange to have him
suffer an unfortunate &quot;accident&quot;, but it was decided it better to
deal with him in a more moderate fashion, to turn him to do their bidding.
Better to deal so with him and have him doing as they dictated ,a mere puppet,
than dealing with&nbsp; the alternative scoundrels, who were even more venal
and corrupt if that were possible.&nbsp; They would be dealt with in other ways
eventually.&nbsp; 

They had found however that Wang had devised very intricate methods of
hoodwinking them of much in the way of goods and money.&nbsp; However angry
they were with him they did not wish to depose him, just change his
&quot;attitude&quot;.&nbsp; It was determined the best way to do this was
through his lovely wife...&nbsp;&nbsp; They would persuade him to reveal what
he was doing and give them the lions share.&nbsp; The plan was, they would
force him to observe as the renowned interrogator and persuader Sing Foo
displayed his wondrous methods of inflicting the most savage and barbarous
methods of persuasion upon his wife.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

Lan Tei was indeed a beautiful&nbsp; woman.&nbsp; Tiny by western standards she
was the epitome of beauty and grace. Barely 5 ft in height, she weighted a mere
90 pounds.&nbsp; Her elegantly formed legs were of exquisite proportions, her
skin the hue of fine ivory and just as smooth.&nbsp; Her face was flawless with
coal black eyes and high cheek bones, all framed by her jet black hair which
hung in a cascade down her back nearly to her finely formed bubble of a
derriere. What many considered her most outstanding attribute however where her
fine, voluptuous breasts., unusually large in one of her race.

Plans were laid and Jan Wang&nbsp; and his lovely wife were invited to a grand
soiree in celebration of some invented occasion in honor of Wang. As the
evening wound down and guests began to depart, Wang and his beautiful wife were
simply not allowed to depart. As the rest of the guests made their way out and
to their places of residence, Wang and Lan Tei were asked to remain a short
time for a special treat for just he and his wife. Wang had no idea what
was&nbsp; about to occur....

They were led to a another part of the splendid residency of the
&quot;group&quot; as they had become known.&nbsp; They were not however taken
to the sumptuous surroundings they expected but were led instead down to the
lower levels of the splendid edifice.&nbsp; The lower they traversed the more
wary Wang became. 

At last they were ushered into a large utilitarian furnished room.&nbsp; They
were set down and the conditions laid out to him.&nbsp;&nbsp; He would reveal
his machinations of commerce and share the majority of the lucrative profits
with them, the &quot;real&quot; rulers of China now.

Wang was infuriated and demanded they let them leave, that he would give them
nothing. It was pointed out to him that in actuality he could be eliminated at
their whim if they chose, and he was really powerless to prevent it.&nbsp; They
merely wanted to know how he operated and who his contacts were..&nbsp; Wang told
them they could go to the Chinese equivalent of Hell.&nbsp; The bargaining went
on for some time to no avail.&nbsp; It was pointed out to Wang that there were
other means to persuade him to change his mind but he was immoveable.&nbsp; 

&quot;Perhaps you will reconsider after we&nbsp; discuss the situation in
another fashion.&quot;

One of the aides left the room and returned a few moments later accompanied by
a Chinese in the elaborate robes of a Mandarin.&nbsp; Wang took one look,&nbsp;
paled and sat down.&nbsp; There was no need to introduce SingFoo. nor explain
his part in the&nbsp; &quot;negotiations&quot;. 

Sing Foo bowed and spoke calmly to Wang.

&quot;Most honored friend. I am here to attempt in arranging some sort of
settlement of the matter in question.&nbsp; Am I correct in stating you decline
to make&nbsp; the requested information available to my friends here?&quot;

Wang had recovered enough to think it was all a bluff and that they had no
leverage to force him to accede to the arrangement. Surely they would not
resort to torturing him.

He was deeply indebted to a large number of people and the consequences of
cutting them out would be disastrous for him.

&quot;I do indeed and there is nothing that will change my mind.&quot;

SingFoo looked hungrily at Lan Tei, eyeing her generous bosom and licking his
lips.

&quot;Oh I can think of a great many things that might change your
thinking.&quot;

&quot;You can do nothing!&nbsp; I refuse and demand you let us be on our
way.&quot;

&quot;I'm afraid that is no longer possible most honored guest.&quot;

&quot;That's insane!&nbsp; Let us go or I will make this known to persons
higher than you who are my friends.&quot;

&quot;Quite the contrary I'm afraid.&nbsp; You see those of whom you speak are
in total agreement with my employers. In addition I might remind you that there
&quot;are&quot; none higher than we. Acquiesce or prepare to suffer the
consequences.&quot;

Wang called upon all his ancestors to curse and destroy them.

&quot;I will not under any circumstances give you what it is you want.&quot;

&quot;Very well then.&nbsp; Escort our guests to their quarters.&quot;

&quot;Release my wife then.&nbsp; She has no knowledge of any of this. She is
useless to you.&quot;

&quot;Ah! I beg to differ most esteemed friend.&nbsp; I think she is the most
important person in this negotiation.&quot;

&quot;Where are you taking us?&nbsp; Release my wife.&quot;

Sing Foo merely grinned and nodded.

&quot;We are going to my private accommodations. You are to be special guests
of mine.&quot;&nbsp; 

A group of grim, unkempt men entered and forcibly manacled both Wang and&nbsp;
Lan Tei.&nbsp; They were hustled from the chambers of the governing clique.

Gagged and with black hoods over their heads Wang and his daughter were thrust
into a waiting carriage and it clattered off.&nbsp; 

It was but a short trip to the forbidding fortress like pagoda of the fearsome
Sing Foo. On arriving they were roughly thrust into the stone edifice and
hustled down flights of stone stairs to the bowels of this forbidding
place.&nbsp; 

Moisture trickled down the rough stone walls of the passageways, dimly lit by
torches.&nbsp; They passed numerous small cells set into the stone, the
passageway sides of them consisted of heavy iron bars. Some were occupied by
poor wretches who had unwisely provoked the displeasure of Sing Foo or one of
his friends. All were cruelly chained either to one of the cell walls or hung
by chains from the ceiling.

Lan Tei, her eyes huge and darting frantically about, struggled futilely against
her captors.&nbsp; 

&quot;What are you doing?&nbsp; You cannot do this to me. My husband is a very
influential man in Peiping.&nbsp; Release me or he will have his friends punish
you...&quot;

Sing Foo bowed to Lan Tei.

&quot;Forgive this unfortunate incident miss.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is your stubborn
husband who is to blame.&nbsp; He need merely accede to my employers requests
and you will be set free,&nbsp; As long as he refuses to cooperate however I
fear you must remain my guest.&quot;

Sing Foo opens a cell door and turns to two jailers, directing them to place
her in the cell and restrain her suitably.&nbsp;&nbsp; 

&quot;And remove her clothing.&quot;

Wang curses at them and screams they dare not do such a thing to his wife...

&quot;Here in my domain, I do as I see fit.&nbsp; Strip the wench!&quot;

Lan Tei screamed and fought against them but she was no match for the burly
jailers.&nbsp; It took but a few moments of ripping and tearing and Lan Tei's
once beautiful robes were in&nbsp; tatters on the floor of the dank cell.

Iron fetters were clamped around her wrists, joined by a short chain..&nbsp; They
forced her to the rear wall of the small cell and raised her hands above her
head hooking them to a ring high on the wall.&nbsp; She was able to stand but
not sit.

The bared door slammed shut and Wang was shoved along the passage.&nbsp; He too
was locked into a dank cell, but it was made sure it was far enough away from
Lan Tei's that they could not communicate, but he was quite able to hear her
cries and her begging to be released.&nbsp; 

Lan Tei must endure alone with no one to communicate with.Her only accompaniment
was the distant screaming coming from someplace in this dungeon.

Days passed.&nbsp; Wang cursed and screamed at the guards as they brought what
was supposedly food but in reality was no more than slop.

Wang had been stripped of his clothing the same as Lan Tei.&nbsp; He was
chained by way of an iron shackle on one ankle. 

Lan Tei hung by her wrists from the large ring imbedded high on the rear wall
of the cell.&nbsp; Since she could neither sit nor lie down she had been unable
to take even the meager nourishment of the inedible food which was left in a
shallow bowl each morning.&nbsp; Her only water came from a surly guard twice a
day.&nbsp; Her repeated questions of why they were being detained and what they
wanted of &quot;her&quot; went unanswered.

Her constant companion were the screams and shrieks coming from she knew not
where.&nbsp; The screams of beings in horrific agony someplace nearby&nbsp; 

Finally after nearly a week of her ordeal, minions of Sing Foo entered her cell
and released her hands.&nbsp; Lan Tei collapsed to the floor in a heap.&nbsp; A
bowl overflowing with savory foods was set in front of her, along with a flask
of water.&nbsp; &quot;EAT&quot; she was told and they left her.&nbsp; Lan Tei
fell upon the food and&nbsp; water devouring it in short order.&nbsp; She was
allowed to languish another day in her dank filthy cell, albeit with an
abundance of food and&nbsp; water.&nbsp; It took little time for her to regain
the strength she had lost while hanging in her cell.

Another day and there was a noisy commotion in the passage.&nbsp; The guards
had come for Jan&nbsp; Wang and he was being forcibly propelled down the
passage, cursing and threatening.&nbsp; As they came to Lan Tei's cubicle he
screamed at them demanding to know what they had done to her.&nbsp; While now
reasonably fed, she showed the signs of her bondage and she was filthy with caked
on dirt and filth, her hair hanging in scraggly strings.&nbsp; They did not
allow him to tarry and he disappeared around a corner in the passage.&nbsp; 

He was thrust through a large doorway&nbsp; into a huge room.&nbsp; Many
torches flickered from baskets on the walls casting a yellowish glow to the
chamber...&nbsp; Wang looked about taking in the numerous devices and
implements.&nbsp; His blood ran cold as he eyed them.&nbsp; They obviously were
meant for one purpose.&nbsp; To inflict terrible pain upon defenseless individuals.

Sing Foo sat in a very large, ornate chair to one side.

&quot;Ahh my friend Jan Wang.&nbsp;&nbsp; And how are you today?&nbsp; I hope
you have been enjoying my fine hospitality.&quot;

&quot;You cretin!&nbsp; I have been been kept chained to the wall of a filthy
cell, kept naked and fed such garbage unfit for pigs, and my wife treated even
harsher.&nbsp; You will release us at once do you hear?&quot;

&quot;Oh I hear you my poor misguided friend but both you and&nbsp; your lovely
wife will remain as my guests until you cooperate with my friends.&quot;

&quot;Never!&nbsp; You may do as you wish.&nbsp; I will never yield to those
demands.&quot;

&quot;We shall see.&nbsp; Secure him!&quot;

The guards dragged Wang to a large, crude wooden chair.&nbsp; They forced him
to sit and secured him in it by means of stout iron bands. One around each arm
to hold it firmly to the arm of the chair, one&nbsp; across each leg just above
the knee held each leg to the seat..An iron greave bolted to the crosspiece
high on the back of the chair was swung over to surround his neck and fastened
like a hasp at the&nbsp; other side of his neck, other iron bands held his
lower legs to the legs of the chair.&nbsp; Wang could do little but struggle
against them.&nbsp; 

&quot;You son of a pig!&nbsp; Let me go!&quot;

Sing Foo ignored him and made a motion with one had to the guards.

&quot;Bring his fair young wife to our little party.&quot;
