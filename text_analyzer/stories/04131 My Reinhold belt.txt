My Reinhold Belt

By SuperA

&nbsp;

In early 1999, another chastitybelt maker arrived on the
scene.� His name was Reinhold. 

&nbsp;

I really like this new belt so in July 1999, while on a
vacation to Europe, I took a side trip about 30 miles
outside of Cologne Germany.
�After a phone call and a 15 minute wait,
Reinhold met my wife and I at the train station.� He dropped Mrs. SuperA off at the Bed &amp;
Breakfast we were staying at and took me to his home in another village about 5
miles away.

&nbsp;

When we arrived, he explained the measuring process. It
would start with me stripping and then him building a plaster cast (made from
medical casting gauze) from my waist down - in about the shape of a speedo
(swimsuit).� After the plaster cured, he
would cut it off and I would be allowed to shower removing any residue, then
re-dress.

&nbsp;

He explained that over the next eight weeks, he would make a
reverse image of the cast and from that image he would make the actual
belt.� The belt would be made from a
composite material � but to me it looks like fiberglass and then he would paint
it the color of my choice.� Below is a
front view of my belt with the right side closed (as if you were in it) and the
left side open.

&nbsp;


 
 
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
 
 
 

 


The non-adjustable waist straps are fitted into the front
plate by an 8 sided �arrow�.� On the
belt�s left side, where there is no strap, (right side of the picture) you can
see the key hole on the bottom of the front plate where the key and lock are
inserted.� This hole resembles what a
skeleton key hole is like.� Here is a close-up
view of the front plate.

&nbsp;


 


&nbsp;

The belt is constructed of 3 molded pieces: the front plate
which extends down and under the groin forming a �doughnut� hole over the anus
and then coming back up where the two waist straps are attached.� I also have a custom made plug for my
doughnut hole, so I can wear it to the beach.

&nbsp;

From a distance of about 10 feet, it pretty much looks like
a shiny thong, but if you get closer, (and you know what to look for) you can
tell it is not.

&nbsp;

The waist straps are attached to the main part of the belt
in the back by two small brass hinges that are not detectable in the pictures.




&nbsp;

From the inside view (of my often used belt) you can see a
(brown) hole which leads to the separate chamber for the penis and a formed
�pouch� where the scrotum is protected.

&nbsp;

The penis hole is the brown colored area, where the paint
has worn off.

&nbsp;

To achieve the perfect fit, I had to use a medium grade wood
file and file down the sides where the ball sac cover meets the groin.� 


 


&nbsp;

&nbsp;

The material is about .25 inches thick and has rounded edges
so there is no binding or pinching of the skin.�
While I had trouble with neoprene and silicone liners on my Jones belt,
I have worn this belt for 104 days non-stop (unfortunately) without any
irritation or rashes (or relief), so there was never a �need� to get out.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;




&nbsp;

The locking mechanism Reinhold uses is unique.

&nbsp;

Using an extended key, the lock is inserted about an inch
into the belt after the waist straps are nestled into their respective
sockets.� The lock prevents the strap
from being lifted out of the socket and thus the belt from being removed.� Here the key is inserted for the right strap.


 


&nbsp;

&nbsp;

The locking mechanism is actually a retrofit lock for the
old-time skeleton key lock.� If you can
picture a skeleton lock, you know the opening is quite large and the tumblers
are easy to turn.� However this new lock
is inserted into that hole, then locked and the key is removed leaving the hole
plugged and the lock, locked.

&nbsp;


 


&nbsp;

Each belt comes with two sets of locks and keys, or a total
of 4 keys and locks.� All four locks and
keys are the same and it does not matter whether they are used on the left or
right side.

&nbsp;

In the photo above, the left lock is off of the key, while
the right key has the lock mounted on the key.�
The lock is the brass component while the key is the chrome component.

&nbsp;

The US American quarter is shown for size comparison.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;


 


&nbsp;

In this close-up view of the lock, the brass lock has a
�tab� on the right side of the otherwise cylindrical lock.� After the lock is inserted into the belt, it
is turned a quarter of a turn and the key is removed.� This turns the tab and places it in a special
indentation (built into the belt) so the lock cannot be removed without turning
the tab.� And the tab cannot be turned
without the key, thus the complete security.

&nbsp;

The lock pictured above is in the locked position.� The only time the key can be removed from the
lock, is when it is in the locked position.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;


 


&nbsp;

In this photo, the lock is in the open position � notice the
alignment of the tabs.

&nbsp;

When the lock is in the open position, it can be removed
from the key and this is what enables the keyholder to pull it out of the
belt.� The lock is about 1.5 inches in
length, while key and lock assembly is about 3.5 inches total.

&nbsp;

-- o --

&nbsp;

In summary, of the three belts I currently own, this my
favorite, however it one downside � the belt is not adjustable.

&nbsp;

One final note - due to overwhelming response, Reinhold
removed all contact information from his web site (www.reinholds.de) although the url is still
reserved.� He has a full time job, and
only intended this to be a part-time hobby.�
But since he has over a years worth of backorders, he has discontinued
�advertising�.

&nbsp;

I sincerely hope that someday, he will resume production.
