Catfight

Chapter 1

&nbsp; The ringing of the doorbell was persistent, accompanied by impatient knocking. Allison hurried down the stairs to open the door. Her little white poodle followed her close behind, barking incessantly.
&nbsp; A woman in her late twenties was standing outside. Her long black hair framed a face that was a bit broader than normal, but very beautiful nonetheless. Allison was struck by her eyes. They were green and had a mesmerizing effect. The only thing that these eyes now exuded was hate. Allison shrank back in instinctive fear. 
&nbsp; �Stay away from my husband you dirty little bitch,� the woman cried out.
&nbsp; Allison stepped back, realizing that this woman was Bobby&#8217;s wife Laura.
&nbsp; �Do you hear me cunt?�
&nbsp; �I have nothing to talk to you about,� Allison said and tried to close the door.
&nbsp; The woman wedged her foot between the door and the jamb and glared through the gap. 
&nbsp; �Stay away from him or I will smash that pretty blond head of yours,� she hissed.
&nbsp; �Who the fuck are you to tell me what to do?� Allison replied boldly.
&nbsp; Laura pushed the door open and clawed at Allison&#8217;s face. Allison cried out as she felt her cheek stinging painfully. The poodle started barking furiously.
&nbsp; �I will call the police,� she said with trembling voice and retreated into the house.
&nbsp; �What are you going to tell them? Who is going to listen to you, little slut? � Laura said, stepping over the threshold. 
&nbsp; Allison clenched her fists and felt a wave of anger rising inside her, blinding her common sense.
&nbsp; �He loves me. He wants to get divorce and marry me,� she said. 
&nbsp; Laura&#8217;s eyes darkened, her arms dropped limply to her sides. It this moment, she looked like a robot whose power had been switched off. 
&nbsp; �Get out of my house,� Alison said loudly. 
&nbsp; Laura turned, swaying on her high heeled boots. Then she looked over her shoulder and asked:
&nbsp; �You are lying, aren&#8217;t you?� 
&nbsp; �I don&#8217;t want to talk to you. Get out!� Allison said, smiling maliciously. 
&nbsp; Laura turned with surprising speed and slapped her face. Allison fell backwards, landing on her buttocks. 
&nbsp; �You will pay for this,� Laura said with eerie calmness. 
&nbsp; She pinned the younger woman down, digging her nails into her throat. Allison&#8217;s blue eyes bulged grotesquely. The poodle growled and tried to bite at Laura. She turned to the dog, then kicked it with the pointed toe of her boot. It retreated with pitiful whining.
&nbsp; Allison grabbed the opportunity and clawed at the hands that were squeezing her throat. She bent her knee, planted her foot on Laura&#8217;s crotch and pushed with all her might. Laura fell on her back and cursed, gloating at the blond lock of hair she had managed to pluck.
&nbsp; Allison got up on her feet and ran toward the stairs, hobbling heavily because she had lost her right mule in the fight. As she reached the bottom of the stairs, Laura had already stood up and was about to attack again. The vase that Allison threw at her hit her square in the forehead, then burst into small pieces. Laura staggered and dropped to her knees. 
&nbsp; �I just wanted to talk to you � but now�� Laura muttered and stiffly rose to her feet. 
&nbsp; Allison kicked off her left mule and ran up the stairs. She was almost at the top when she heard a fitful panting behind her. Spinning around, she saw Laura grabbing at her ankles. Her kick missed Laura&#8217;s nose by an inch. The sharp movement she made threw her off balance. She flailed her arms and fell heavily on top of Laura. The two women tumbled down the stairs, locked in a deadly embrace. Their terrified screams pierced the air. 

 Chapter 2

&nbsp; Laura&#8217;s head was ringing. She wasn&#8217;t sure if she had regained consciousness or just the dream looked more realistic. Her eyelids fluttered as she tried to chase the dizziness away. Then she realized that her cheek was resting comfortably on Allison&#8217;s breasts. She lifted her head with a start and looked with disgust at the woman she hated so much. In this moment, Allison looked like an innocent sleeping child. Her chest heaved with uneven, anxious breaths which gave the impression that she was having a nightmare. 
&nbsp; �You can&#8217;t fool me, bitch,� Laura said angrily. 
&nbsp; There was no response so she pulled herself up on her elbows, starting to get up on her knees. The pain sank its jagged teeth into her lower legs and shot up her thighs. Laura wailed and dropped heavily on top of Allison, burying her face into her breasts once again. This time, their softness felt surprisingly soothing. The pain abated a little, but quickly renewed its severity as she looked back over her shoulder to see what was wrong with her legs. In fact, she only saw the back side of her left boot with its broken heel dangling to one side. Her eyes were drawn by the staircase that towered above them. 
&nbsp; �All the way down the stairs!� Laura said to herself and started to cry bitterly.
&nbsp; �Please, don&#8217;t hurt me!� Allison uttered.
&nbsp; Laura tried to turn on her side, but the pain pinned her down again.
&nbsp; �Please let me go!� 
&nbsp; �Shut up! You are of no interest to me anymore,� Laura hissed.
&nbsp; Allison writhed, attempting to free herself. Laura let out a painful scream and shuddered.
&nbsp; �Don&#8217;t move! Please, don&#8217;t move! My legs are broken,� Laura pleaded pitifully.
&nbsp; The terror in Allison&#8217;s eyes began slowly to recede. She blinked, took a deep breath and sighed. Then she felt Laura&#8217;s cheek pressing against her breasts, and her tears moistening them. She lay still for a moment, feeling her nipples hardening.&nbsp; 
&nbsp; �We can&#8217;t stay that way forever. I have to pull myself out if I were to help you,� Allison said with calm voice.
&nbsp; �Ok,� Laura nodded and gritted her teeth as the pain intensified.
&nbsp; �Both your legs are broken, ha! Let us see what we can do. At first, I think you should apologize for your behavior,� Allison said and lifted her head to look at Laura&#8217;s legs.
&nbsp; �I need to go to a hospital,� the injured woman said with subdued anger.
&nbsp; �Aha, so, is that the way you apologize?�
&nbsp; �I&#8217;m so sorry. I made a terrible mistake. Please, hurry!�
&nbsp; �Well, that&#8217;s a bit better.�
&nbsp; Allison arched her back, trying to pull her arms from behind her back. They felt sore and stiff which made the task more difficult. Laura started to moan with pain.
&nbsp; �Shut the fuck up!� Allison blurted angrily. 
&nbsp; Laura whimpered and grew quiet. Allison managed to free her arms, then tried to heave herself up. Her arms refused to obey her. They felt distant, as if detached from her body. And then, a horrible pain flashed through her shoulders. Allison dropped back, feeling weak and dizzy. She was able to focus her eyes enough to see that her arms were twisted unnaturally. 
&nbsp; �Oh my God!� she gasped and paled.&nbsp; 
&nbsp; Laura stared at her uncomprehendingly, still trying to cope with her own suffering. 
&nbsp; �Are you hurt too,� Laura asked. 
&nbsp; �I can&#8217;t move my arms. Oh my God, what&#8217;s wrong with my arms!� Allison uttered and her eyes turned upwards. Then her body started to shake violently.
&nbsp; �Allison, you have to calm yourself down. I need your help.�
&nbsp; Laura cast an anxious glance at Allison and gently caressed her face.
&nbsp; �Listen to me, Allison! You will be fine, but you have to help me.� 
&nbsp; �I� I am so scared and it hurts so much��
&nbsp; �Look, now I have to turn on my side. When I do so, you will be able to stand up and get to the phone.�
&nbsp;&nbsp; Allison sniffed and nodded. Laura pressed the palms of her hands on the floor, pushed herself up and slumped to her right side. The pain in her legs became unbearable and she lost consciousness. Allison managed to stand up on her shaky legs, then tottered toward the phone. Her arms were hanging limply by her sides. As she reached the phone, she realized that lifting the receiver or dialing a number was an impossible task for her.












Chapter 3

&nbsp; Laura felt a painful, stabbing sensation in her ribs. It helped her, though quite brutally to come round. She moaned and instinctively lifted her hands to protect herself. Allison&#8217;s big toe nudged at her ribs again. Laura tried to protest, but her lips were so stiff that she could hardly move them. Only a gurgling noise escaped her throat. The pain in her broken legs reached a new level. 
&nbsp; �Please stop it!� Laura managed to utter.
&nbsp; �Sorry, I just wanted to wake you up,� Allison said.
&nbsp; �Are they coming yet?� Laura asked.
&nbsp; �I couldn&#8217;t dial the number,� Allison replied and chuckled nervously. 
&nbsp; �What!�
&nbsp; �What, what! I have already told you that my arms are injured? I can&#8217;t lift the receiver nor dial a number.�
&nbsp; Laura&#8217;s eyes bulged with surprise, then darkened as the gravity of the situation dawn on her. 
&nbsp; �Can you open the front door?� she asked. 
&nbsp; �I tried �but my arms are virtually � useless. I can barely move my fingers.�
&nbsp; �Noooooo� Laura cried and her body shook with sobs.
&nbsp; �Hey, listen to me! We can do it.� Allison said and looked at the phone.
&nbsp; �How?� Laura asked, sniffing miserably.
&nbsp; �You have to do the talking!�
&nbsp; Laura looked at the phone that was about five meters away and said, �No way. My legs are killing me. I can&#8217;t even budge an inch. Don&#8217;t count on me crawling all the way��
&nbsp; �It&#8217;s not necessary,� Allison said and retraced her way to the phone. 
&nbsp; She lifted her right foot and tried to reach the phone. Her body swayed dangerously, as well as her arms. The pain shot up into to her shoulders, paralyzing her for a moment. She managed to muffle her cry, then lowered her foot to the floor. Staggering, she spread her legs apart to steady herself.
&nbsp; �Oh, dear! You nearly fell over!� Laura shouted at her.
&nbsp; �I noticed that,� Allison replied with all the sarcasm she could muster.
&nbsp; Laura mumbled something unintelligible and angrily hit the floor with the palm of her hand. Then she rolled herself on her side, ignoring the twinge that threatened to knock her unconscious again.
&nbsp; �What are you doing?� Allison asked and stared curiously at Laura.
&nbsp; �I am going� to try� to drag myself to �� she explained, panting at every word.
&nbsp; �Oh, come on! Stay put! My dizziness is almost gone. I will try again.�
&nbsp; �Thank you,� Laura said and cautiously rested her head on the floor.
&nbsp; Allison&#8217;s second try turned out to be a success. The receiver landed heavily on the floor and span like a top. Allison kicked it toward Laura and grinned like a Cheshire cat. 

Chapter 4

&nbsp; Allison could not believe what she was seeing. She had never thought that this could happen to her. The doctor was wrapping her chest with plaster bandages. Humming a tune, he seemed engrossed with what he was doing. His deft hands molded the plaster around her breast, then smoothed it carefully. Allison wanted to protest, to scream with indignity and rage. However, she remained silent, realizing that she didn&#8217;t have any options. Then she tried to picture herself in public, wearing this huge cast. Her eyes shed a few tears that dribbled down her cheek. Her muscles tensed with the natural urge to wipe the tears away. The casts on her arms stopped her.&nbsp; 
&nbsp; �Don&#8217;t move, please!� the doctor said.
&nbsp; �How am I supposed to live like this!� she mumbled, staring at the cast. 
&nbsp; The doctor looked at her with puzzled expression, coughed and said:
&nbsp; �I am sorry for the inconveniences.�
&nbsp; Allison chuckled nervously, then moved her fingers to check if they function properly.
&nbsp; �What&#8217;s this?� Allison asked as she saw the two bars the doctor was holding in his hand.
&nbsp; �I have to embed these in the cast.�
&nbsp; �Why?�
&nbsp; �To support your arms and keep them elevated.�
&nbsp; �I will be looking like a freak,� she said with disgust.
&nbsp; �I don&#8217;t think so. You look�fine. More than fine actually, much more,� the doctor said and grinned. 
&nbsp; Ten minutes later the cast was finished. After it dried, a nurse brought a wheelchair and helped Allison stand up. The weight of the massive cast pressed down on her, making her feel helpless and weak. She sat clumsily in the wheelchair and tried to relax. The nurse made sure that she was comfortable and pushed her out.
&nbsp; �Where are we going?� Allison said in a tired voice.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp; �To your room.�
&nbsp; The room turned out to be at the end of the corridor. The nurse opened the door and wheeled her in. Allison&#8217;s eyes bulged with surprise. Laura, looking drawn and tired was lying on the bed to the left. Her broken legs were placed in casts and were suspended on slings. A sign of recognition flickered on her face. She moaned and turned her head aside. Allison shifted nervously in her wheelchair. 
&nbsp; �Do you know each other?� the nurse asked. 
&nbsp; �I want another roommate,� Laura announced.
&nbsp; �Unfortunately, I don&#8217;t think it is possible right now,� the nurse said with embarrassment.
&nbsp; Laura sighed and said:�Ok.� 
&nbsp; �I am very disappointed as well,� Allison said.
&nbsp; �I will talk to the doctor,� the nurse said as she helped Allison to her bed.
&nbsp; �Thank you!� Laura mumbled. 
&nbsp; The nurse lingered for a minute before retreating.
&nbsp; An awkward silence enveloped the room like a shroud. Laura was&nbsp;&nbsp; staring unblinkingly at her toes, which were sticking out of the casts. At the same time, Allison did her best to tame her emotions. The anxious thoughts about the future multiplied within her, making her dizzy. There were too many questions and not enough answers. Suddenly, unable to control herself, she broke into tears. 
&nbsp; �Am I supposed to comfort you, little baby?� Laura hissed.
&nbsp; �They said I have to spend three months in the cast,� Allison wailed.
&nbsp; �They said I won&#8217;t be able to put weight on my legs for at least four months,� Laura replied angrily.
&nbsp; Allison smiled inwardly, realizing that she wasn&#8217;t alone in her misery. The flow of tears stopped.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;
