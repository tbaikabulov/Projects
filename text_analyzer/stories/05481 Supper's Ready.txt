SUPPER�S READY

&nbsp;

A Collection of 5 Poems:-

&nbsp;

Supper�s Ready

Mommy�s Rules

My Bad Luck

The Contract

And Finally

&nbsp;

by Velvetglove

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

SUPPER�S READY

&nbsp;

You

In a place I�ve never seen.

Me

The other side of
the screen.

You in some strange part of
the world

Or perhaps down the road ?

Even � maybe � next door ?

Can we truly know for sure ?

&nbsp;

You sat at your screen.

Me hunched over
mine.

Making love unseen

Our minds entwined.

My wife downstairs

Cooking my meal.

You�re not my affair

But how would she feel ?

&nbsp;

You take me away

To faraway places

We all live our lives

On the other side
of our faces.

But what of your husband ?

Or is she really your wife ?

Can I truly be sure ?

Would I gamble my life ?

&nbsp;

You turn me on

With words and your wits

I�ve seen them for sure.

Unlike your face
or tits.

My pants round my ankles

It�s your voice I hear.

�Your supper�s ready�.

Yes, I�m
coming dear !

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

MOMMY�S RULES

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

I always
remember what my mommy said

If you really
have to, then give some head

But never once
swallow, always spit

Don�t even try
just a bit of it.

If you want to
know about the sack

Let me put it
simply; �Stay on your back

Put out the
lights, act nice and meek

Saturday nights, once a week�.

That way he�ll
respect you the next day

You�ll be his
�lady�, not his �bitch� or �lay�.

Playing with
sex toys is just for fools

Above all, my
dearest � the three golden rules:

Never date a
man who likes it rough.

And no ifs, no
butts, no anal stuff.

If he likes
pornography, that�s the worst

Get rid of
him, if he hasn�t chucked you first !

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

MY BAD LUCK

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

It�s my bad Luck

To have married a Schmuck

Who�s name is Huck.

He has a friend called Buck

And another called Chuck

Who has a Truck

Covered in Muck.

Where we Suck

And Fuck.

And with Buck and Chuck

I laugh about Huck

My stupid Cuck

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

THE CONTRACT

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

I love watching you work

Both of you slaving away

You down on your hands and knees

Her doing whatever I say;

My own housemaid and butler

Full time cook and driver

My masseuse and her other half

My 24/7 live-in domestic staff !

&nbsp;

I love watching you work

Sweat dripping on a Summer�s
day

Unpaid, but not unrewarded

Symbiosis is the rage today.

Her washing pots and pans

While you scrub my toilet pans

You see us and you know your place

My cream lubricates the masseuse�s face

&nbsp;

Tinkle her bell and the maid comes

In apron, fishnets and high heels

She unlocks your steel belt

I wonder how her cold touch feels ?

You don�t come, but you�re near

Every fourth Sunday of the year

What bliss ! A
meagre, ruined flick

No follow though - it�s over quick.

&nbsp;

You carry the butler�s tray

Breakfasts are
my favourite meals

A hushed tap
on my bedroom door

Enter ! See my cook who kneels

You serve my
coffee on the side

Then turn and
leave without your pride

A glance
between us when she moaned

No doubt by whom this cook is owned.

&nbsp;

I love
watching you work

Shivering in
the Winter�s chill

Clearing the
snow from the garden paths

Her face indoors above the sill.

Behind the
pane my left hand grips

I smile at you
and pull on her hips

It�s getting
dark the paths are wide

There�s more
to do, much more, inside

&nbsp;

I love watching you work

But at night you sleep in the dark

Noises crackle down your intercom

Your wife moans and outside dogs bark.

The cellar�s damp but let�s be fair

Your work is done. Spring�s in the air

The weeks have flown by, the year has
ended

And now your contract can be extended

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

AND FINALLY

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Before you reach for your reviewer�s pen

And decide to score this �half out of ten�

Your dicks and clits still soft and dry

My poetry didn�t make you laugh.

Or cry.

&nbsp;

What�s the purpose of the guff above ?

Not the usual stuff from Velvetglove.

Reviews matter but please don�t pry

Into when or what we write.

Or why.
