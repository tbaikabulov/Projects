It is the first Story I published on the Internet june
1994 through Penet.fi as an anomymous writer. I got about 5 reactions, but
there was no-one I got the feeling on the same diversion as I was. But I got
warnings to encrypt. Since I do not really know how to do that including the
consequences I stopped publishing, but stil I want to find contacts. Just to
exchange stories and drawings.

Justice.

&nbsp;

The count looked at the beautiful young girl that sat
opposite of him at the well loaded table. He smiled to the girl, trying to be
as nice to her as possible under the given situation. 

He had some mixed feelings about this and tried to
explain his point of view.

&quot;It is just bad luck for you, dear&quot;, he
argued, &quot;but there is a law to uphold&quot;.

&quot;But that law is inhuman&quot;, the girl
protested. Her name was Ruby and she was only seventeen years old. She was so
scared, that her voice quivered. But she realized that her only chance was to
behave as normally as she could. Even in this horrid situation. She had to keep
her wits together.

&quot;May be so. By the way, I already did abandon
this law&quot;, the count shrugged, &quot;but at the time of your offence it
still was a law. So it has to be enforced. Even if I had quite forgot�ten about
it. It was all about my little handicapped daughter, Mary. The other children
dared to tease her. So that's why I put my foot down and promised a severe an
painful death penal�ty to anybody who would say or do anything that would harm
my little girl. And it worked. The rule was properly written down as an
official law and deposi�ted. It was confirmed with my signature. It put an end
to the problem directly. And my little girl was happy again&quot;.

&quot;But nobody was ever executed because of that
law. And no one knew about it any more. Why me....&quot;, the girl wined

&quot;Well as I said, just bad luck&quot;, the count
said shifting in his seat. Ruby was a very attractive peasant girl, a servant
at the palace now for almost a year. With her fair complexion, her smooth skin
and her thick waving blond hair. Her large blue eyes were now filled with
tears. 

Part of the count did really pity her. That's why he
invited her. He would try to explain things to her, try to convince her, that
he had no other way. And also, as a sort of apology, treat her to a nice
meal.....

&quot;Vaughn is the one who caught you, teasing Mary.
He knew about this law and he demands that justice is done. You know how
straightforward he is. As he demands it, and there is a law by which even I
have to abide, I can't do anything else but condemn you to the registered
punishment, which happens to be a slow and painful death by public execution,
however sorry I am.....&quot;, he explained.

&quot;But this is not some sort of a mild punishment,
sire, this is a torture and death sentence. It means the end of my life. Death
for an attractive young girl, like me. Sure you will reconsider, sire,
please&quot;.

&quot;I am so sorry, dear, but it has been written all
down. Even I can't change that now&quot;, the count said concerned.

&quot;Do you realize, sire, that maybe the executioner
will strip� me stark naked on the
scaffold, so that everybody can see my breasts and my buttocks.....&quot;, the
girl sobbed.

The count had realized that. He shrugged his
shoulders.

&quot;That man could hardly give you your proper
punishment if you were not naked, dear. All victims are always naked on the
scaffold. Man or woman.....&quot;, he answered lightly.

The girl sat with her hands in front of her face. Her
shoul�ders shook in sobbing.

&quot;But stop crying, my dear. There is still some
time. Look what they have prepared for you. Isn't this delicious&quot;.

&quot;It is, sire, it is, and I am grateful for your
kindness&quot;, looking up and she even tried to smile, &quot;It is only
difficult for me to eat since my throat is lumpy because of fear. I can only
think of that horrible moment that I have to go to the scaffold and that the
hangman will torture me....&quot;

&quot;Of course, my little girl, I understand that.
But nothing is going to change that. That's what's going to happen. I can't
help it. The only thing I can and will do, is please you to this treat and be
nice to you now. The king serving the maid, but tomorrow will definitely be
your last day...&quot;.

&quot;Then at least&quot;, the girl begged, &quot;Let
them kill me quickly. Let the humiliating and the torturing be&quot;.

&quot;Well dear, I am so sorry for you, but it is
impossible. It has been noted in the law, that the punish�ment rule is speci�fic
about this way of execution. Otherwise you could have been strangled or hanged
or any other painless way to die, but the culprit's death must be a slow, painful
and humili�ating spectacle&quot;.

&quot;Even if that means that my intimate parts must
be expo�sed in public, sire...&quot;, she begged.

&quot;How else could it be done, my dear. Your young
and beautiful body will bound and spread. Vulnerable and naked of course. High
on the scaffold, for everybody to see. I am sure the executioner will spread
your legs wide open......�.

&quot;But you will forbid him to touch my sexual
parts&quot;, she prote�sted, pressing her delicate hands in her lap, &quot;that
would be so indecent.....&quot;.

&quot;Why no, certainly not, my dear&quot;, the count apologized,
&quot;You are very sensitive there. Your delicate parts will be his aim. We all
know his specialities. He is an expert on girls. Certainly their sensitive
parts. That's were he can apply his irons and whips. On your soft belly, your
breasts and all the other delicate female�
parts. That is were it will hurt the most and that is his assignment.
Because that is to be your punishment. To be hurt and killed, to make you
scream in agony, before you die. I am sorry for you, but torturing your female
parts is very effective. I always give the executioner a free hand, to treat
those delicate parts specially, inside and outside...&quot;.

&quot;But the pain and the humiliation.....&quot;, she
protested.

&quot;Well, that's just the point. Is not your love
button the most sensi�tive part of your body. So let him torture you there.
Your labia are very delicate. How will a burning iron make you scream. Your
vagina is an opening to your sensitive belly. An real invitation for torture,
dear. If the hangman must torture you, as is his assignment, I can't forbid him
to use your sensitive spots. I would contradict myself, wouldn't I.....?&quot;.

&quot;It is so inhuman. Look at me, sire, my beauty,
even you must see it, please reconsider, I ought to be protected. Not expo�sed...it
is so indecent.....&quot;.

&quot;Well, sorry dear, but it is seen as an essential
part in the proceedings. People will look up to you and realize that neither
womanhood, youth or beauty can influence my feeling for justice So they are
warned&quot;.

&nbsp;

The count looked very serious. He did not really hate
this beautiful creature, but did not really mind her fate. And certainly he
knew that Vaughn, who was just waiting to find him at fault would not forgive
him. That awfull man might even try to raise a revolt against him, just showing
how the count did not even abide with his own laws.� Of course he was a little bit sorry for the
girl, but on the other hand he was secretly a bit curious over the spectacle
that the execution of this beauty would be. Executions always were quite a
spectacle, a break in monotonous daily live and in this case.... In general he
loved executions....

It would of course mean the death of the girl, but she
certainly could be missed since a score of other peasant girls would love to
take her place at the castle.

&nbsp;

Light filtered in through the high lead paned windows.
A ray of red just touching her blond hairs. A drama it was, that was for
sure.....

She tried to eat a few things from the overloaded
table. She looked out of the window and than asked for the last time...

&quot;Sire, I beg you&quot;, Ruby looked pleadingly at
him, &quot;Why can't you show mercy on me. I am only seventeen years old. I am
so young. I want to live...&quot;.

&quot;Of course dear, I understand, but there is a
problem. You were quite nasty to Mary and you made her cry. Vaughn happened to
hear that. He was really upset seeing what you had done to my girl, so he says.
And then he remembered the law. I know it is silly now, but still. What would
justice be if the count himself would not live by the laws he laid down
himself. Vaughn saw it as his duty to turn you in. What can I do.....&quot;.

She did not answer. Then she looked up at him and
smiled her beautiful smile�.

&quot;I will do whatever you want, sire&quot;, she
said bending her head.

The count swallowed. It was clear that she meant to
offer him her body. 

&quot;Oh no, dear, that's not what I made you come
here for&quot;, he protested.

&quot;I don't mind sire&quot;, she said, rising up
from her seat. She started unbuttoning her blouse.

&quot;I just don't want to die. When I show you how
nice my body is, you will get other ideas then sending me to a scaffold. I
don�t know what will happen on the scaffold, but I am so scared after what you
told me about the hangman. I can imagine what he will do� to me...... Look at me, sire.....&quot;.

By now she was stark naked. Her blouse and hem lay
behind her and she had stepped out of her skirts. 

The count didn't know were to look. His eyes darted
over her naked body. From her face to her breasts to the soft blond patch of
hair under her belly. What a fine girl that was. So marvellous a body.

She cupped her firm young breasts in her slim hands
and said:

&quot;Surely you would not want all my beauty to be
wasted, sire&quot;.

&quot;Eh....no....eh...but&quot;, the count stammered.

&quot;And all this, sire&quot;.

She spread her alabaster legs and showed him her soft
pink genitals. With her left hand she ran down her belly and spread the firmly
closed petals of her sex apart, introducing him to her most intimate and
attractive parts.

The count could not help to get very excited, because
he was a healthy man....

Ruby came over to him and sat on his lap. She noticed
the bulge in his pants. She draped her slender body against his.

&quot;But, but...&quot;, the count protested, but at
the same time he put his arm around her soft curves and caressed her lovely
breasts.

&quot;I'll do what you want, sire&quot;, she
whispered.

&quot;I see&quot;, he replied, &quot;but it will not
help you. You have to die Ruby.....ah, ah AAAH&quot;.

The young girl pretended not to hear him. She opened
his pants and took his penis in her girly hands. 

&quot;Come...&quot;, she whispered, &quot;You are such
a strong man...&quot;.

He sure looked strong. His penis was very stiff. He
did not� want it, but she really turned him on. And at the same time he felt
guilty. Of course she would get her hopes up. But he already had ordered her
execution. He had no intention to stop that. 

Ruby worked him over. She put her mouth around his
dick and licked him. He groaned for lust. The drama in this spectacle excited
him even more. 

Ruby straddled his lap, splitting her supple body so
that he could enter her sex. His excitement mounted so sudden that the brush of
her clitoris over his penis made him grab her haun�ches an he pulled her
violently down. Deeply he pushed his male organ into her, spearing the girl
like a pig on the grill. She shouted in sudden pain, because she been a virgin
maiden. Her ruptu�red hymen was pain as hell, but she did not care. She was
sure that he would not have her executed after this. He humped her up and down,
not able to control himself, feeling his lust quickly rising to a peak....

He raged as a bull when he came, inside the unlucky
little girl...

Spent she slipped to the floor. She looked up at him.
The sun playing over her blond hairs and her lively face open and
beautiful.....

&quot;Please.....&quot;, she was so lovely.

The count tried to regain his breath. Panting with his
eyes closed. Then he shook his head.....

&quot;No way, dear, you will have to die......&quot;.

The girl collapsed on the floor. The count looked down
on her vulnerable naked body. In her misery she assumed a foetal pose, her
knees al the way up her chin. Then could not help seeing her perfect round
buttocks, between which her girlish sexlips gleamed soft and still wet from his
come. 

He tried to get her up and social again, but she would
not move. So he left the room.

After some time she got up got dressed again and sat
down on the floor in a corner of the room. There the guards found her and
brought her back to her cell.

&nbsp;

The execution took place at the market�place on the
market day and was every much the spectacle it had promised to be. A big crowd
gathe�red. People were discussing all over the fate of the unlucky girl. All
sort of arguments were heard. From pure anger over a silly law that long before
should have been lifted to more stern people who shared the view of the count
that laws should be enforced, whatever the conse�quences. Everybody was there
to see....

&nbsp;

Ruby was forced upon the scaffold by two layman. The
executio�ner was waiting for her. His upperbody bare en only dressed in shorts,
a black hood over his head. He did not intend to have any pity with the soft
and vulnerable girl since he saw her pure and alone as a culprit that was to
meet her proper punishment.

&nbsp;

Ruby had her bare arms bound on her back with rough
rope and was dressed only in a single rough garment made of dark jute.

But not long did she have that last protection. The
first thing the hangman did was rip the garment from her body, leaving her
stark naked to the gaze of the public. 

She screamed of hurt indignity, but the crowd chee�red.
All the people looked at the perfect globes of her breasts with the dark
nipples. Several pointed al the blond bush under her belly. Ruby cried for
shame. The executioner proceeded with his ghastly duties.

She was bound with her arms above her head and lifted
from the scaffold, dangling about with her feet half a meter of the floor from
the gallows overhead.

Everybody could now see the white female body in all
her feminine detail.

The first hiss of the whip. The terrible scream over
the court. Her body danced about, her legs flying about. She turned around. The
whip hit her back, her front, her belly, breasts and buttocks. Ruby suffered
terrible. The hangman swayed the whip very skilfully. Never doing her serious
bodily harm yet, but making her suffering almost inendurable. First he aimed
for her bottom, flicking the whip a those moments her round crimson cheeks were
in the best position. 

The count sat on a balcony overseeing the spectacle.
His feelings were mixed. On one side he did really pity the girl, but the
darker side of him got secretly aroused.....

Now the executioner went for the soft breasts of the
girl, trying to land the whip on the exact spot of her nipples. Drops of red
blood showed after he succeeded to hit both her nipples will all the force he
had in his arms......

Finally he aimed for her soft white belly, not even
sparing her intimate parts, the crowd cheering when the whip cracked between
her legs, touching her viciously at her most intimate spot. Again and again he
flicked the whip up, preciscely at the moment that her legs were spread and the
tip of the whip landed between the soft lips of the girls sex...

&nbsp;

After this cruel and indignant whipping Ruby got a
moment of rest, in which time a charcoal brazier was put on the scaf�fold.

Several irons where sticking out of the mean little
flames.

Ruby was taken down from the gallows only to be bound
at wooden bars. Her arms and legs spread wide, to make her body available for
the next torment. 

The spectators stretched their necks to glimpse at the
her intimate parts now freely to be seen between her wide open thighs.

Ruby's screams reverberated from the facades of the
houses around the marketplace as her tormentor touched her body all over with
the glowing hot irons. Her female body jumped and contorted when the iron
burned her skin.� Her armpits, her
haunches, her thighs everywhere the hot iron burned his mark right into her
sensitive flesh. She almost had no screams left, but when the iron came home at
her right nipple, burning it completely away, she screamed up, her boun�cing
body even moving the wooden bars that held her arms...

The executioner put the last iron back in the flames,
wanting it to be glowing right hot, before he used it on the most sensitive
spot of the female body. While waiting he caressed the body, playing with her
sexual parts, pinching her sexlips and pummelling her clitoris.....

Ruby recollected her wits just enough to realize where
this last iron should go. She started screaming even before she saw the iron,
the executioner held up before her eyes, showing how little red sparks fell
from the tip.

Then slowly he lowered it between her wide open legs.
The red glow of the iron illuminated the female lips of her sex. Closer and
closer it came, within only an inch of her love-button. 

A second the man waited in anticipation then he landed
the red hot iron on her clitoris.� 

The body of Ruby just flew right up in the air,
forming a white tormented bow on the cross that held her arms and legs. The
scream that tore out of her throat had nothing human anymore........

Wild with pain she tossed up and down, her haunches
making a raffle on the wooden bars. Then the torturer pushed down her hips,
opened with his left thumb and forefinger her labia and then with a great hoeishhhh
sent the glowing hot steel bar deep in her vagina.....

Ruby hips bounced up and a last cry tore from her
throat. This was too much. Her body went limp and she fainted away. 

The executioner stood back, looking satisfied down at
his handwork. Then he� looked at the
count and nodded. The count said it was enough. She could put an end to her
now. 

In the meantime the two layman had removed the steel
bar from Ruby's vagina. The slapped her cheeks and finally her eyes fluttered
to life again. Only to realise that now she was going to be killed. 

She saw it in the eyes of the hangman. She also
realised how she was to die. The word suddenly got through to her and stuck in
her mind. She saw a cleaver in his hand. She was going to be quartered
alive.......

She was mounted upside down to the cross. Her two legs
up in the air in a big V. The executioner swung up the axe and brought in down
between her legs, precisely in between her little labia. With a sickening sound
her buttocks parted. The cleaver stuck in the soft part of her belly.

Ruby high pitched screams were weakening now. The axe
came down again splitting the body of the girl in two halves. 

The hangman was red with the blood of the dying girl.
He opened her chest and ripped out her hart. It was still beating the moment he
ripped it out. He held it up and showed it to the crowd......

Ruby was beyond any human torture. She was dead. Her
sentence done. The executioner split the two halves of her body, hang�ing the
four parts at the four corners of the scaffold. His work was done.....

&nbsp;

The people who had not missed a single moment went
home satisfied. This was justice done. The count smiled. He still felt a bit
sorry for the girl but he took himself together....

Her execution had amused him.....

"That man could hardly give you your proper punishment if you were not naked, dear. All victims are always naked on the scaffold. Man or woman.....", he answered lightly.

The girl sat with her hands in front of her face. Her shoulders shook in sobbing.

"But stop crying, my dear. There is still some time. Look what they have prepared for you. Isn't this delicious".

"It is, sire, it is, and I am grateful for your kindness", looking up and she even tried to smile, "It is only difficult for me to eat since my throat is lumpy because of fear. I can only think of that horrible moment that I have to go to the scaffold and that the hangman will torture me...."

"Of course, my little girl, I understand that. But nothing is going to change that. That's what's going to happen. I can't help it. The only thing I can and will do, is please you to this treat and be nice to you now. The king serving the maid, but tomorrow will definitely be your last day...".

"Then at least", the girl begged, "Let them kill me quickly. Let the humiliating and the torturing be".

"Well dear, I am so sorry for you, but it is impossible. It has been noted in the law, that the punishment rule is specific about this way of execution. Otherwise you could have been strangled or hanged or any other painless way to die, but the culprit's death must be a slow, painful and humiliating spectacle".

"Even if that means that my intimate parts must be exposed in public, sire...", she begged.

"How else could it be done, my dear. Your young and beautiful body will bound and spread. Vulnerable and naked of course. High on the scaffold, for everybody to see. I am sure the executioner will spread your legs wide open......�.

"But you will forbid him to touch my sexual parts", she protested, pressing her delicate hands in her lap, "that would be so indecent.....".

"Why no, certainly not, my dear", the count apologized, "You are very sensitive there. Your delicate parts will be his aim. We all know his specialities. He is an expert on girls. Certainly their sensitive parts. That's were he can apply his irons and whips. On your soft belly, your breasts and all the other delicate female&nbsp; parts. That is were it will hurt the most and that is his assignment. Because that is to be your punishment. To be hurt and killed, to make you scream in agony, before you die. I am sorry for you, but torturing your female parts is very effective. I always give the executioner a free hand, to treat those delicate parts specially, inside and outside...".

"But the pain and the humiliation.....", she protested.

"Well, that's just the point. Is not your love button the most sensitive part of your body. So let him torture you there. Your labia are very delicate. How will a burning iron make you scream. Your vagina is an opening to your sensitive belly. An real invitation for torture, dear. If the hangman must torture you, as is his assignment, I can't forbid him to use your sensitive spots. I would contradict myself, wouldn't I.....?".

"It is so inhuman. Look at me, sire, my beauty, even you must see it, please reconsider, I ought to be protected. Not exposed...it is so indecent.....".

"Well, sorry dear, but it is seen as an essential part in the proceedings. People will look up to you and realize that neither womanhood, youth or beauty can influence my feeling for justice So they are warned".



The count looked very serious. He did not really hate this beautiful creature, but did not really mind her fate.

She tried to eat a few things from the overloaded table. She looked out of the window and than asked for the last time...

"Sire, I beg you", Ruby looked pleadingly at him, "Why can't you show mercy on me. I am only seventeen years old. I am so young. I want to live...".

"Of course dear, I understand, but there is a problem. You were quite nasty to Mary and you made her cry. Vaughn happened to hear that.

What would justice be if the count himself would not live by the laws he laid down himself. Vaughn saw it as his duty to turn you in. What can I do.....".

She did not answer. Then she looked up at him and smiled her beautiful smile�.

"I will do whatever you want, sire", she said bending her head.

"Oh no, dear, that's not what I made you come here for", he protested.

"I don't mind sire", she said, rising up from her seat. She started unbuttoning her blouse.

She cupped her firm young breasts in her slim hands and said:

"Surely you would not want all my beauty to be wasted, sire".

"Eh....no....eh...but", the count stammered.

"And all this, sire".

She spread her alabaster legs and showed him her soft pink genitals. With her left hand she ran down her belly and spread the firmly closed petals of her sex apart, introducing him to her most intimate and attractive parts.

The count could not help to get very excited, because he was a healthy man....

Ruby came over to him and sat on his lap. She noticed the bulge in his pants. She draped her slender body against his.

"But, but...", the count protested, but at the same time he put his arm around her soft curves and caressed her lovely breasts.

"I'll do what you want, sire", she whispered.

"I see", he replied, "but it will not help you. You have to die Ruby.....ah, ah AAAH".

The young girl pretended not to hear him. She opened his pants and took his penis in her girly hands. 

"Come...", she whispered, "You are such a strong man...".

He sure looked strong. His penis was very stiff. He did not want it, but she really turned him on. And at the same time he felt guilty. Of course she would get her hopes up. But he already had ordered her execution. He had no intention to stop that. 

Ruby worked him over. She put her mouth around his dick and licked him. He groaned for lust. The drama in this spectacle excited him even more. 

Ruby straddled his lap, splitting her supple body so that he could enter her sex. His excitement mounted so sudden that the brush of her clitoris over his penis made him grab her haunches an he pulled her violently down. Deeply he pushed his male organ into her, spearing the girl like a pig on the grill. She shouted in sudden pain, because she been a virgin maiden. Her ruptured hymen was pain as hell, but she did not care. She was sure that he would not have her executed after this. He humped her up and down, not able to control himself, feeling his lust quickly rising to a peak....

He raged as a bull when he came, inside the unlucky little girl...

Spent she slipped to the floor. She looked up at him. The sun playing over her blond hairs and her lively face open and beautiful.....

"Please.....", she was so lovely.

The count tried to regain his breath. Panting with his eyes closed. Then he shook his head.....

"No way, dear, you will have to die......".

The girl collapsed on the floor. The count looked down on her vulnerable naked body. In her misery she assumed a foetal pose, her knees al the way up her chin. Then could not help seeing her perfect round buttocks, between which her girlish sex lips gleamed soft and still wet from his come. 

He tried to get her up and social again, but she would not move. So he left the room.

After some time she got up got dressed again and sat down on the floor in a corner of the room. There the guards found her and brought her back to her cell.



The execution took place at the marketplace on the market day and was every much the spectacle it had promised to be. A big crowd gathered. People were discussing all over the fate of the unlucky girl. All sort of arguments were heard. From pure anger over a silly law that long before should have been lifted to more stern people who shared the view of the count that laws should be enforced, whatever the consequences. Everybody was there to see....



Ruby was forced upon the scaffold by two layman. The executioner was waiting for her. His upper body bare en only dressed in shorts, a black hood over his head. He did not intend to have any pity with the soft and vulnerable girl since he saw her pure and alone as a culprit that was to meet her proper punishment.



Ruby had her bare arms bound on her back with rough rope and was dressed only in a single rough garment made of dark jute.

But not long did she have that last protection. The first thing the hangman did was rip the garment from her body, leaving her stark naked to the gaze of the public. 

She screamed of hurt indignity, but the crowd cheered. All the people looked at the perfect globes of her breasts with the dark nipples. Several pointed at the tiny blond bush under her belly. Ruby cried for shame. The executioner proceeded with his ghastly duties.

She was bound with her arms above her head and lifted from the scaffold, dangling about with her feet half a meter of the floor from the gallows overhead.

Everybody could now see the white female body in all her feminine detail.

The first hiss of the whip. The terrible scream over the court. Her body danced about, her legs flying about. She turned around. The whip hit her back, her front, her belly, breasts and buttocks. Ruby suffered terrible. The hangman swayed the whip very skilfully. Never doing her serious bodily harm yet, but making her suffering almost unendurable. First he aimed for her bottom, flicking the whip a those moments her round crimson cheeks were in the best position. 

The count sat on a balcony overseeing the spectacle. His feelings were mixed. On one side he did really pity the girl, but the darker side of him got secretly aroused.....

Now the executioner went for the soft breasts of the girl, trying to land the whip on the exact spot of her nipples. Drops of red blood showed after he succeeded to hit both her nipples will all the force he had in his arms......

Finally he aimed for her soft white belly, not even sparing her intimate parts, the crowd cheering when the whip cracked between her legs, touching her viciously at her most intimate spot. Again and again he flicked the whip up, precisely at the moment that her legs were spread and the tip of the whip landed between the soft lips of the girls sex...



After this cruel and indignant whipping Ruby got a moment of rest, in which time a charcoal brazier was put on the scaffold.

Several irons where sticking out of the mean little flames.

Ruby was taken down from the gallows only to be bound at wooden bars. Her arms and legs spread wide, to make her body available for the next torment. 

The spectators stretched their necks to glimpse at the her intimate parts now freely to be seen between her wide open thighs.

Ruby's screams reverberated from the facades of the houses around the marketplace as her tormentor touched her body all over with the glowing hot irons. Her female body jumped and contorted when the iron burned her skin.&nbsp; Her armpits, her haunches, her thighs everywhere the hot iron burned his mark right into her sensitive flesh. She almost had no screams left, but when the iron came home at her right nipple, burning it completely away, she screamed up, her bouncing body even moving the heavy wooden bars that held her arms...

The executioner put the last iron back in the flames, wanting it to be glowing right hot, before he used it on the most sensitive spot of the female body. While waiting he caressed the body, playing with her sexual parts, pinching her sex lips and pummelling her clitoris.....

Ruby recollected her wits just enough to realize where this last iron should go. She started screaming even before she saw the iron, the executioner held up before her eyes, showing how little red sparks fell from the tip.

Then slowly he lowered it between her wide open legs. The red glow of the iron illuminated the female lips of her sex. Closer and closer it came, within only an inch of her love-button. 

A second the man waited in anticipation then he landed the red hot iron on her clitoris.&nbsp; 

The body of Ruby just flew right up in the air, forming a white tormented bow on the cross that held her arms and legs. The scream that tore out of her throat had nothing human anymore........

Wild with pain she tossed up and down, her haunches making a raffle on the wooden bars. Then the torturer pushed down her hips, opened with his left thumb and forefinger her labia and then with a great hhoeish sent the glowing hot steel bar deep in her vagina.....

Ruby hips bounced up and a last cry tore from her throat. This was too much. Het body went limp and she fainted away. 

The executioner stood back, looking satisfied down at his handwork. Then he&nbsp; looked at the count and nodded. The count said it was enough. She could put an end to her now. 

In the meantime the two layman had removed the steel bar from Ruby's vagina. The slapped her cheeks and finally her eyes fluttered to life again. Only to realise that now she was going to be killed. 

She saw it in the eyes of the hangman. She also realised how she was to die. The word suddenly got through to her and stuck in her mind. She saw a cleaver in his hand. She was going to be quartered alive.......

She was mounted upside down to the cross. Her two legs up in the air in a big V. The executioner swung up the axe and brought in down between her legs, precisely in between her little labia. With a sickening sound her buttocks parted. The cleaver stuck in the soft part of her belly.

Ruby high pitched screams were weakening now. The axe came down again splitting the body of the girl in two halves. 

The hangman was red with the blood of the dying girl. He opened her chest and ripped out her hart. It was still beating the moment he ripped it out. He held it up and showed it to the crowd......

Ruby was beyond any human torture. She was dead. Her sentence done. The executioner split the two halves of her body, hanging the four parts at the four corners of the scaffold. His work was done.....



The people who had not missed a single moment went home satisfied. This was justice done. The count smiled. He still felt a bit sorry for the girl but he took himself together....

Her execution had amused him.....
