&quot;File the folders on my desk and type up the report and then email it
  to all the addressees, Sandy. Try and get it out of the way by morning break.
  I'll be back about eleven. My meeting with the boss has been brought forward
  by an hour so I've got to rush.&quot; Caroline Jensen brusquely gave secretary,
  Sandy Matthews her work instructions for the morning and swept out of the room
  clutching her laptop and a box file. 
&quot;Yes, Miss Jensen,&quot; I replied automatically and added to myself, &quot;A
  'please' would have been nice.&quot; It wasn't that Caroline was a bad departmental
  head. She was efficient and had a good grasp of what her underlings could do
  but she did treat them just as underlings. She gave them orders; she set them
  work and expected it done in the minimum of time and with the minimum of fuss. 
My real name is Edwina but I've been called Sandy ever since I was a baby
  on account of my blonde hair, which has darkened over the years, but I've not
  attempted to bleach it. Resignedly I picked up the folders and returned to
  my office booth and noisily dumped them on my desk. 
&quot;Boss lady given us four hours work to do in two?&quot; enquired Rosalind
  Packer my companion and friend in the office. We'd been at secretarial college
  together and worked for the Masons Group for the past three years. We often
  went clubbing on a Friday night and had even double dated but neither of us
  had got into a permanent relationship with anyone. At twenty-three years old
  we figured we still had plenty of time to play the field. 
&quot;Something like that Roz. How much work have you got on?&quot; 
&quot;Enough to keep me busy for a month but I can find time to file those
  folders if you like. You know more about setting out that report than I do.&quot; 
&quot;Thanks Roz. I owe you one. There's a few more on her desk though.&quot; 
Twenty minutes later, Roz called out, &quot;Hey Sandy, look at this.&quot; Roz
  held up what looked like a birthday card envelope. &quot;It was on her desk
  under the folders.&quot; We knew it wasn't anywhere near her birthday. From
  the inside Roz removed a gold invitation card.&quot; 
Devlish Delights 
cordially invites 
Caroline Jensen 
to a special adult party aboard the 
&quot;Sensuous Swan&quot; 
for the weekend starting Friday July 30th

I took the card and read it several times. We'd heard rumours about the sex
  parties Caroline attended seemingly about once a month and we suspected that
  these parties helped her climb the corporate ladder. &quot;Scan it Roz and
  put it back. Well decide what to do later when we have more time.&quot; When
  the scan was done, I emailed the picture to my home computer. Meanwhile I accessed
  Caroline's email, which in her rush to get to the meeting, remained
  open and found the message: 
Log on to www.emitytraptluda.com and
  use password gnikcuf4. It didn't take me long to notice the meaning of the
  words when read backwards! 
My mind was more on the invitation card than the report so I made several
  silly mistakes; mistakes that would have earned me a severe reprimand had I
  not asked Roz to proof read it for me. &quot;You're thinking of gate crashing
  that party aren't you?&quot; Roz accused me. 
&quot;Why not? Why should she have all the fun? If we meet the right people
  we might get an office of our own too. Neither of us is averse to spreading
  our legs now and again. We could have a fun weekend. Might be more going on
  than at the clubs we visit.&quot; 
Our conversation came to a halt when Caroline returned to the office a little
  earlier than she expected. Her first words were, &quot;Have you sent that report
  yet?&quot; 
&quot;I'm just about to attach it to the email Miss Jensen,&quot; I replied, &quot;I'll
  print you a copy shortly.&quot; 
Half an hour later she threw the report back on my desk, &quot;Tart it up.
  Make it into a presentation report. Add a few pictures and laminate it.&quot; 
I felt like screaming at her but just remarked, &quot;That will take most
  of the day Miss Jensen and we are behind with our routine work now because
  of it.&quot; 
&quot;Then perhaps you'd better work through your lunch hour,&quot; she snapped
  back. I rightly guessed the meeting hadn't gone her way. I felt like punching
  the woman in the face but of course I didn't. 
&nbsp; 
&quot;Do you really think we can get away with this?&quot; Roz looked a bit
  uncertain as we sat in front of my home computer and read the instructions
  for getting to the party. It was far more complex than jumping in a taxi and
  walking in a front door. 
We went through the instructions item by item. 
Wear warm inconspicuous clothes, The Sensuous Swan is moored about one
    mile from Brightwell Quay and the journey across the open water can be cold
    even in the summer. Wear soft shoes. High heels are not allowed on any of
    the boats. 
Arrive at Brightwell Quay between 6:30 p.m. and 10 p.m. After 10 p.m.
    there is insufficient depth of water for the Petite Swan to get alongside
    the quay. The Petite Swan will pick up guests on each hour and half-hour.
    Please ensure you bring your invitation card. 
&quot;That's straightforward,&quot; I said. 
&quot;Yeah provided our fake card passes inspection,&quot; Roz replied nervously. 
Bring one small piece of hand luggage. You will not need evening dresses
    or changes of clothing. Berths will be allocated by randomly allocating a
    male and female guest to each cabin. Guests must be in bed naked with their
    allocated partner by midnight and permit full intercourse at any time one
    of the partners desires it. Guests will be expected to allow others the use
    of their bodies for a wide range of sexual activities at all times and must
    allow these activities to be witnessed by others. It is anticipated that
    several orgies will take place. Guests refusing to take part in such events
    will be publicly disciplined. 
&quot;Obviously we are going to be well and truly fucked but I wonder what
  they mean by 'a wide range of sexual activities'? And what if we don't like
  the guest we have to sleep with?&quot; Roz asked. 
I suggested, Perhaps oral and anal sex and doing it in a group.&quot; Both
  of us had done the first two before but only once had we done it in each other's
  company so that couldn't really be considered group sex. We thought we could
  handle that, even with a stranger as a partner. &quot;I guess we have to take
  pot-luck as to our room mate. We might get a hunk or a pot-bellied dodderer.
  If we don't get what we want, I'm sure we can make up for it during the rest
  of the time.&quot; 
&quot;What about the discipline?&quot; 
&quot;Sounds like they only do that if you don't want to be fucked. That shouldn't
  be a problem for you Roz,&quot; I teased her although I knew she was no more
  promiscuous than I was. 
No cameras or other recording equipment are permitted. 
That should be pretty obvious. No photos reduces the chances of blackmail,&quot; Roz
  remarked and I agreed. 
This weekend will have a Roman theme. All men will wear a toga and all
    women will wear a revealing Romanesque tunic. These will be issued on arrival.
    No underwear will be permitted and the only other item of clothing allowed
    is a pair of soft shoes. Discrete jewellery and slave collars are also permitted. 
&quot;Seems as if we dress to be available to everyone,&quot; Roz remarked. 
&quot;And everyone is available to us. Stop being so negative. Don't you want
  to go?&quot; 
&quot;I just think it is a bit risky.&quot; Roz's face then brightened, &quot;It
  will be a hit in the eye for Caroline though if we carry it off. We're both
  younger and better endowed than she is.&quot; 
A buffet type dinner will be available in the dining room until 9 p.m.
    on Friday followed by a Getting to Know You dance. We are fortunate in again
    obtaining the services of Des Hirton to compare the dance and to ensure guests
    do get to know each other intimately. Adult entertainment shows are scheduled
    for Saturday evening. 
&quot;That sounds an interesting dance. We should be able to look everyone
  over and decide who to set our sights on.&quot; 
As a slight diversion a boat cruise will be offered on the Petite Swan
    on Saturday afternoon, weather permitting. Normal dress is required for this
    event. 
&quot;We might need a break by then. It's been six months since I last went
  out on a boat. I used to go most weekends while I was at college.&quot; Roz
  knew of my love of boats but she didn't enjoy being on the sea especially if
  it was in an open boat and she got wet. 
&quot;Depends on how calm it is and if the Petite Swan is covered in,&quot; she
  grinned. &quot;Maybe I'll want to get a few more pricks in me while you're
  out boating.&quot; 
The weekend will finish with a roast dinner at 1 p.m. on Sunday after
    which guests may dress and depart. The Petite Swan will ferry guests to Brightwell
    Quay at half hourly intervals providing there is sufficient depth of water
    (probably 3 p.m. will be the first trip. If any guests must leave before
    then, contact the skipper who may be able to transfer you in the small motor
    launch. 
We wish all our guests a stimulating, satisfying and enjoyable weekend. 
Griff Normansen. 
&quot;We hope so too Griff,,&quot; I said to the screen. 
Roz was still uncertain about us going. I think she would have gone willingly
  if we'd had a kosher invitation. &quot;What do you think they'll do to us if
  we are discovered?&quot; she asked. 
&quot;Make us walk the plank or something!&quot; I laughed, &quot;No, I guess
  they daren't do much except refuse us entry and send us back home. No doubt
  Caroline will rub our noses in it on the Monday after she's opened her legs
  to climb higher on the corporate ladder.&quot; 
We discussed it time and time again over the next few days. In the end we
  decided not to reply and when we arrived at the quay, if there were any questions
  as to why we weren't on any list, we would say that we did reply by email and
  perhaps it got in with the spam. 
Caroline left off work early and the Friday but left us with several hours'
  work. We decided to work till four and leave what wasn't done. &quot;I think
  we should aim for the 8 p.m. ferry boat Roz. We'll find the car park and see
  if her distinctive yellow sports car is there and if it is and she's not on
  the quay we'll get on the ferry. That way it won't be fully light and we should
  get to the &quot;Sensuous Swan&quot; in time to get some food from the buffet.&quot; 
Roz now seemed to accept the whole idea and agreed to the plan. Indeed the
  first part worked out just as we planned it. Caroline's car was in the car
  park and she wasn't on the quay. An attractive man in full seaman's uniform
  looked at our tickets and checked our names. &quot;You don't seem to be on
  my list,&quot; he remarked. We'd half expected this. 
&quot;We didn't email our reply until yesterday so perhaps it hadn't got through
  when they made your list up,&quot; I tried to sound confident. &quot;Or maybe
  your spam filter took our email out. We've had that happen before.&quot; He
  looked at our invitations again and then told us to get aboard. A couple in
  their thirties, were already on board. They introduced themselves as Marjorie
  and Ken. We chatted for about five minutes and no one else seemed to be around
  so the skipper prepared to leave. 
&quot;I'll cast off the painter when you're ready,&quot; I said to the skipper
  as revved the engine slightly. I knew he probably did it himself all the time,
  but I wanted to show him I knew a little seamanship. He must have realised
  it from my use of the word 'painter' for the rope that tied the boat to the
  quay. I'd already scrambled onto the foredeck so he just nodded when he was
  ready. Instead of sitting with the others I went into the little wheelhouse
  and stood alongside him. &quot;It's nice to be riding the waves again,&quot; I
  remarked to make conversation. 
&quot;It will be more than waves you'll be riding this weekend,&quot; he guffawed. 
&quot;I hope so,&quot; I shouted back to him over the noise of the engine.
  That broke the ice and we chatted, or rather shouted at each other, for the
  whole of the ten-minute trip as the boat punched into the fresh breeze and
  choppy sea that sent spray flying to the stern. I looked back at Roz sitting
  in the shelter of the small passenger cabin and gave her the thumbs up but
  she didn't give me more than a sour look in reply. Soon we arrived at what
  looked to be an old inter-island cruise ship. Not one of the big luxury liners
  but I found out later that in earlier years it had taken passengers and cargo
  between the islands off the coast of Norway. 
A wide set of steps had been provided for us to get from the ferry to the
  main ship. I waited until Marjorie and Ken had started up the steps and then
  waved to the skipper, &quot;Thanks Skip,&quot; I shouted as I grabbed my bag
  and climbed up to the main deck. Roz followed. 
We were shown into an office. &quot;Welcome back Marjorie. Let's see what
  cabin you're in.&quot; He put his hand in a bag and pulled out a Bingo type
  ball. &quot;Number 23 that's with�&quot; he looked at the computer screen�&quot;Terry
  Petterson. You probably know him.&quot; 
&quot;Yes, he'll suit me fine,&quot; Marjorie seemed pleased. 
&quot;Hope I get one of these two young ladies,&quot; Ken looked at us. 
&quot;Number 16. Elizabeth James. Sorry she's a bit older than you wanted
  but it's the luck of the draw.&quot; 
&quot;Yes, I know her. Old but insatiable. Still no doubt I will get a chance
  at these during the day.&quot; Ken didn't look too disgruntled. 
&quot;Hi, I'm Griff.&quot; I introduced Roz and myself. &quot;Sorry, I have
  no record of you. You weren't sent an invitation and we didn't receive a reply.
  Can you tell me how you came by these tickets?&quot; 
&quot;They came in the post.&quot; I began to worry but I showed him the envelope
  that I had previously sent to myself and was therefore postmarked similar to
  Caroline's but of course it had a different post office stamp. I brazened it
  out when he further questioned us but Roz unfortunately looked like she was
  guilty and only muttered her answers. In the questioning I did let slip that
  I worked for the Masons Group. 
Eventually he looked at me directly in the eyes and said, &quot;I don't really
  believe a word of your story but I will be nice to have two younger girls at
  the party. For now I am putting you both in cabin 42.&quot; He pushed a button
  that I assumed rang a bell somewhere. 
My spirits rose when he virtually said we could attend the party and cheekily
  asked, &quot;Aren't we going to be partnered with a man?&quot; 
&quot;I will have to see what can be arranged. We weren't expecting you.&quot; A
  woman in a traditional maid's uniform knocked at the door. &quot;Ah, Gladys,
  we have two extras for the weekend. Take them to Cabin 42. Find them their
  tunics and make the bed up if it isn't already done please.&quot; 
&quot;Yes sir,&quot; she answered smartly. 
Turning to us he said, &quot;Go with Gladys and put on the tunics. That and
  your shoes, and your ankle socks if you wish, are the only things you are to
  wear. Gladys will help you into your tunics and then show you the general layout
  and take you to the dining room.&quot; My heart leapt. We'd made it to the
  party. That would surprise Caroline. 
We passed her on the way to the dining room. &quot;What are you two doing
  here?&quot; she asked. 
&quot;Having a party,&quot; I laughed. 
Three quarters of an hour later and we had really begun to enjoy ourselves.
  The food was good and we began to lose our embarrassment at the revealing tunic
  we wore when everyone was similarly dressed. So far no one was having sex but
  I'd seen glimpses of several hard pricks when men sat down with an erection.
  My own cunt I knew could be seen like those of several women sitting opposite
  me but we knew we were in for a weekend of sex so I tried to show it as much
  as possible. Of course, being the youngest girls, and I believed the prettiest
  there, we were the centre of attention. It all came to an abrupt end when a
  uniformed security guard came and said quietly, Mr. Normansen would like to
  see you in his office. Now please.&quot; 
&quot;Sandy Matthews and Rosalind Packer, the invitation cards you presented
  to me a forgeries. Forgeries done I suspect by you Sandy from the one we sent
  to Caroline. You also accessed Caroline's personal emails. Caroline is stating
  you will both be out of a job on Monday and with news of what you have done
  being mentioned to those present, you will be unlikely to get a similar job
  in the foreseeable future. The invitations only go to members and membership
  costs much more than you can afford on your salary unless you have a sponsor
  and I'm sure you don't.&quot; 
&quot;I'm sorry�&quot; I started, &quot;We just wanted to go to an adult party� We�Roz� didn't
  want to�&quot; 
&quot;Let me finish. However, you now know more about our organisation than
  you should. We can persuade Caroline not to sack you but it comes with a price
  tag. One that you can afford but won't want to pay. The choice for you is this.
  Either we put you in a locked cabin until Sunday and send you home in disgrace
  and let Caroline sack you both and put the word around about you, or�. or�you
  submit yourselves to our punishment. Corporal punishment that will be given
  in front of everyone here. I will consult my executive committee before deciding
  on the extent of your punishment but I can assure you it will be painful and
  you will remember it long after you leave here. You have five minutes to make
  up your minds. Choose between the sack and the cane for I guess that will be
  the preferred instrument.&quot; 
Roz was already crying loudly and tears ran down my face too. Griff left the
  room but the security man stood in the doorway. &quot;What are we going to
  do?&quot; Roz wailed. &quot;You� You got us into this, now you get us out of
  it.&quot; 
I angrily told her to shut up and to think what she wanted to do. Look for
  a new job or take the cane. I'd already decided. The job was reasonably well
  paid and I guessed they had the influence to prevent us getting a similar position
  elsewhere. I knew a caning would hurt but it would soon be over. My main reservation
  was what Caroline would do when we returned to work. 
Griff returned. It seemed he'd only been away a couple of minutes. At least
  we didn't have hours to agonise over a decision. &quot;Which is it to be?&quot; he
  asked. 
&quot;Is there no other choice?&quot; I tried to barter, &quot;We could let
  you use our bodies for your pleasure.&quot; 
&quot;We're going to do that anyway. You came here to be fucked and you surely
  will be whichever choice you make. Do you choose the cane or the sack? They're
  the only two options open to you.&quot; 
&quot;Will we be caned hard?&quot; 
&quot;Enough of this prevarication. Cane or job hunting? Answer now.&quot; Still
  I couldn't bring myself to reply. Roz was crying so loudly she wasn't capable
  of giving an answer. Griff turned to the security guy, &quot;Lock them up.
  Keep them handcuffed and allow any guests or crew to visit them and use them
  in any way. Any way at all.&quot; 
&quot;No, no!&quot; I yelled, &quot;I'll take the cane.&quot; He asked if
  I was sure and I said that I was. When he asked Roz she just nodded her agreement. 
&quot;Take them to their room and strip their tunics off. Keep them there
  until we have all the preparations in place. It won't take many minutes.&quot; 
Handcuffed we were taken to Cabin 42. Gladys was already there and she unlaced
  our tunics so when the security guy who Gladys called Mike, undid our cuffs,
  the tunic was removed and the cuffs replaced. Both Gladys and Mike seemed sorry
  for us but they didn't comment. Gladys dried our eyes with tissues, as we couldn't
  do it with cuffed wrists. 
The wait seemed interminable but was probably only about ten minutes and then
  we were led into the main saloon. Roz who had been quiet during the wait, starting
  crying again and tears fell down my cheeks too. Somehow during our wait I had
  forgotten our nakedness but seeing the others with their tunics on brought
  it to my mind and I blushed deeply. Griff was up on the small stage with a
  microphone. 
&quot;Good evening ladies and gentlemen. Before we begin the dance part of
  the programme I am sorry to tell you that we have a little problem to deal
  with.&quot; Everyone must have known it concerned us because we were standing
  at the front in full view. It seems these two young ladies have gate-crashed
  this party by forging invitations and accessing their bosses email and then
  worming their way on to the boat by telling a pack of lies. It seems they were
  over eager to get some of the sex they believed went on here. They will certainly
  get some of that. Their boss wished to dismiss them from her employ but we
  offered to discipline them instead and the ladies agreed to this, albeit rather
  reluctantly. Probably at this moment they are having second thoughts but it
  is too late for that.&quot; All eyes seemed to be on us. 
&quot;However, your management committee when we reviewed the whole affair
  came to the conclusion that their boss, Caroline Jensen, was also negligent
  in that she didn't keep the invitation securely out of their way and didn't
  close down her email system when she left her office. She provided the temptation.
  We therefore decided to punish her as well so that she will remember in future.&quot; 
&quot;NO!&quot; Caroline stood and yelled, &quot;It wasn't my fault I got
  called away at a moment's notice.&quot; They must have been expecting some
  sort of outburst because two men were already by her side and a third cuffed
  her wrists in front of her. 
&quot;We took that into consideration Caroline and we will not be punishing
  you as hard as the two girls.&quot; He looked to the side door, &quot;Wheel
  the barrel in.&quot; A man in sailor's uniform pushed a water butt size barrel
  into the room. The barrel was on its side and fastened to a frame that kept
  it in place. On the frame were four small wheels that could be locked to prevent
  the contraption from moving. I saw there were straps in various places and
  it was obvious as to the use of the whole thing. Caroline yelled again knowing
  the barrel was only used for serious punishments. &quot;Strap her down,&quot; Griff
  ordered. Despite her struggles Caroline was soon draped over the barrel and
  held there with straps around her wrists, ankles and across her back. We were
  very close and when her skirt was pulled up, I could see her shaven cunt between
  her wide spread legs and I guessed that before long I would be on view like
  that. 
&quot;For your negligence Caroline, we are awarding you six strokes of the
  tawse,&quot; Griff announced to her and his audience, &quot;Will the bo'sun
  please step forward and commence the punishment.&quot; A burly man in an old
  time sailor's costume walked into the room. In his hand was a thick leather
  strap some two feet long and over two inches wide with the ends split into
  two parts. It was a vicious instrument and Caroline had seen it used before.
  She screamed, yelled and pleaded in an unseemly manner that made me resolve
  not to demean myself like that. That resolve went out of the room when the
  bo'sun swung the leather in a wide arc and brought in down with great ferocity
  across her unprotected arse. Her piercing scream filled the room and it brought
  a cheer from some of the audience. Some though shed a few tears. My thoughts
  were rather more selfish. I wondered if he would swing the cane like that when
  it was our turn and if her punishment was lighter than ours, how bad would
  ours be? How would she treat us when we returned to work on Monday? Would we
  be capable of working on Monday? A horrible red band appeared where the tawse
  had struck. The bo'sun seemed to be counting and then he swung the tawse and
  it landed with the same terrible force. Again the scream almost deafened those
  nearby. I was sobbing uncontrollably and I could feel and hear Roz shaking
  and wailing alongside me. 
It seemed to take forever because of the wait between each stroke but the
  bo'sun seemed to know what he was doing. By the sixth stroke, Caroline's arse
  was one huge patch of raw, sore flesh and she was hysterical but her ordeal
  wasn't over. 
&quot;Push her over there and leave her like that for twenty minutes. Anyone
  may use her,&quot; Griff announced. Immediately the barrel was in position
  and the wheels again locked, a man came forward and lifted his toga to reveal
  a stiff cock. Without any preamble he thrust into her, not into her cunt as
  I expected, but into her bum hole. It caused further screams that drowned out
  Griff's next announcement. Caroline was quickly silenced with a gag. 
&quot;I do hope they don't do that to me after a caning,&quot; I thought but
  I was by no means sure they wouldn't. My attention was taken by another barrel
  being rolled into the saloon. &quot;Now we come to the real culprits,&quot; Griff
  spoke into the mike again, &quot;This is Rosalind Packer,&quot; he indicated
  my partner, &quot;It seems she only reluctantly went along with the nefarious
  scheme. Nevertheless she did go along with it and must now be punished although
  we will deal with her less severely than her partner in crime. Ten strokes
  of the cane, Bo'sun if you please.&quot; 
Roz yelled at the top of her voice and then collapsed at my feet. From the
  look of sheer terror on her face and the puddle of piss around my feet, I knew
  she'd passed out just from the thought of the caning. Before I could do anything,
  even had that been possible with handcuffs on, two men picked her up and fastened
  her to the barrel. They were part way through this operation when Roz came
  round and started screaming again but they soon completed their work. One of
  the guests appeared to be a doctor and he came forward looking rather incongruous
  in a Roman toga with a stethoscope draped around his neck. He listened to Roz's
  heart for a few moments and then nodded to the bo'sun. 
For the first time I noticed the cane he intended to use and without any experience,
  I could tell it was a proper punishment cane. It was long, polished brown and
  about as thick as my little finger. I nearly fainted at the sight of it especially
  as I suspected I was getting more than ten strokes. I prayed the bo'sun would
  be a little more merciful with us than he was with Caroline. His first stroke
  convinced me that he had no such thought. The cane whistled through the air
  and seemed to bury itself in Roz's buttocks. She cried piteously. I tried to
  go to her but hands held me. Then there was the awful wait while the white
  stripe turned a livid red and the sides swelled to leave a deep welt. 
&quot;You can't give her ten like that,&quot; I shouted above the clapping
  but no one took any notice. The cane sang again and left another terrible stripe
  almost touching the first. Tears ran down my face as I tried to shut out Roz's
  screams. &quot;It can't be happening,&quot; I thought, but I knew it was and
  it would be my turn soon. Relentlessly the bo'sun applied the cane methodically
  to the tortured arse. At the eighth stroke Roz passed out again but was quickly
  revived when a bottle was held under her nose. After the tenth and last stroke
  she was a sobbing, choking wreck. The doctor came forward again and listened
  to her heart and gently examined her arse. He looked serious and spoke with
  Griff who nodded and told the sailor to push the barrel to one side and to
  bring in another. It was my turn. A man stepped forward ready to rape Roz but
  Griff told him to wait until after my punishment. 
They strapped me to the barrel before Griff announced my sentence. &quot;Ladies
  and Gentlemen, we now come to the real perpetrator of the crime, Edwina Matthews
  better known as Sandy. We are certain she planned and did most of the forgery
  work. It was her that told a lying story to me. I had intended to give her
  double what her partner had.&quot; Had I not been head down over the barrel
  I would have fainted but I'm told that having blood running to the brain keeps
  one conscious longer. &quot;But the doctor has advised against it saying there
  could well be permanent injury and scarring. I'm sure none of us wish such
  an attractive arse spoiled in that way. The doctor assures me that Roz's welts
  will be readily visible for a few months but will disappear in a year at the
  most. In view of this I have changed to sentence from that the committee deemed
  suitable to twelve strokes of the tawse and then ten with the cane. I hope
  that is acceptable to everyone.&quot; I didn't hear any comments. &quot;Please
  commence the punishment Bo'sun.&quot; 
&quot;NO!!&quot; I yelled at the top of my voice, &quot;It's inhuman!&quot; but
  no one seemed to take any notice. Shortly afterwards I heard the first swish
  of the tawse and then felt the extraordinarily painful band of fire across
  my bum. Never in my whole life had I known such pain and there were eleven
  more to come before the cane. &quot;I'll take the sack option,&quot; I yelled
  but I knew it was too late for that. I passed out at the seventh stroke and
  again at the twelfth. So much for the head down argument. My cries now were
  very hoarse and I started coughing but that didn't bring me any relief. My
  arse felt as if it was swollen with the skin stretched tight like a balloon
  and I wondered if it would burst when the cane struck. 
It didn't but I lost consciousness again and they used ammonia to revive me.
  The next pain filled eternity is but a blur on my mind. It seemed that after
  almost every stroke I had to smell the acrid gas to waken me. Finally though
  it came to an end. Once again the doctor examined me and spoke with Griff who
  relayed the information to the guests. 
&quot;Ladies and Gentlemen, I had intended that you be allowed unrestricted
  access to this pair and then have them sent to the crew's quarters for their
  enjoyment. In deference to the doctor's opinion, I will allow you to have access
  to them for twenty minutes the same as Caroline. I would however warn you that
  we did not get a blood test certificate from them and while I have no reason
  to suspect they have any infection, you might wish to wear protection. At the
  end of the twenty minutes the doc will take them to the casualty room and after
  doing what he has to do, will pass them on to the crew. We hope they will be
  available again to you by tomorrow evening. Des, I do apologise for taking
  up your dance time. Caroline can be released now and we'll push the other barrels
  to one side out of the way so you can continue with the Getting to Know You
  dances. I apologise to all of you guests for what has happened although I think
  some of you appreciated the extra entertainment.&quot; 
I heard Roz scream again and I felt someone start to fuck me but when his
  loins hit my bum I lost it again but he must have continued because the next
  thing I remember was him juddering his climax inside me. Obviously he didn't
  heed Griff's warning about protection. Goodness knows how many guests ravished
  me before I was released and half carried to casualty and laid face up on a
  bed. Roz was in a similar state in the bed alongside. She looked daggers at
  me but didn't speak. A woman in nurse's uniform was there and gave us a carton
  of juice to drink through a straw. The doctor had arrived with us and prescribed
  a painkilling injection, which the nurse administered. &quot;Let them rest
  for half an hour and then they have to go to the crew. We must hope they treat
  them more kindly than the guests. No one has ever been thrashed like Sandy
  while I have attended these parties. It is more than their crime deserved.&quot; 
The injection eased the pain considerably until we started to move. Even with
  the help of two sailors, the journey to the crew's saloon was a painful experience.
  They laid us gently on two settees. &quot;The injection should last until the
  morning but if it doesn't and they seem in considerable pain again, call the
  nurse and I have authorised her to give them another,&quot; the doctor told
  them. &quot;Griff has stated you can use their bodies in any way you wish.
  I cannot override his authority on this but I do urge you to be as gentle as
  you can. They've had a thrashing like no other person has had on this ship.
  If they develop any other problems like delirium or feverishness, do not hesitate
  to call the nurse or myself.&quot; 
When he left I noticed Skip standing alongside me. &quot;I had the same instruction
  about using them from Griff. They really seem to have put his back up with
  what really wasn't much more than a prank. Nurse also gave me some cream, which
  she said might help. First I have to ask, how many of you wish to fuck this
  pair?&quot; 
I couldn't see but a couple must have put their hands up because there were
  protests from the others and I heard a female voice shout, &quot;If you touch
  her Jack Simmonds, I'll personally pull your balls off.&quot; 
&quot;That's settled then,&quot; I heard Skip remark, &quot;I'm going to take
  care of Sandy tonight�&quot; There were hoots and ribald comments from the
  others. &quot;No damn you. I'm not intending to fuck her while she's in that
  state. Only the moron guests would do that. I have a large bed and en suite
  facilities and I will be taking good care of her.&quot; The others still grinned
  but didn't make further comments. It seemed strange to be talked about in this
  way but I felt abnormally tired and didn't say anything. Roz too was lying
  quietly at the moment, probably the result of the injection. &quot;Now who
  would like to care for Roz?&quot; Skip went on. &quot;Someone needs to care
  for her tonight and be prepared to have a restless night if she wakes up in
  pain.&quot; 
Several male voices answered and then I recognised Gladys's voice. &quot;I'll
  take care of her. I've similar facilities to you Skip even if they aren't quite
  as splendid.&quot; She came over to me and knelt by my side, &quot;Are you
  happy to let Skip look after you? If not I'll ask Marisa or one of the other
  girls.&quot; When I tried to talk only a croak came out but in the end I did
  manage to say, that Skip would be fine. &quot;If you scream one of us will
  come running. That was a terrible thing they did to you both. Usually it's
  just a few strokes of the strap. Caroline had it harder than most other guests
  ever did but you and Roz� As I said, if Skip doesn't treat you right, scream.
  You should be okay with him though. He's a man of his word.&quot; 
Skip gently lifted me and folded me effortlessly over his shoulder. For a
  fleeting moment I thought how my sex must be on show to all those in the room
  but then remembered they'd seen all of me and were probably looking more at
  my blistered arse than my cunt. As I left the room, I heard Gladys ask for
  some help to get Roz to her room but I was too tired to look and see what happened. 
When I opened my eyes again I was face down on a bed and I could hear a shower
  running. Skip picked me up and I realised he was naked too. For a moment I
  panicked and was about to scream when he spoke. &quot;It's okay Sandy. I need
  to get you in the showers and wash some of the tear stain off your face and
  let the cool water flow over your arse.&quot; At first he stood me under the
  showerhead and washed my face and breasts and then made me kneel so the water
  washed over the welts. &quot;Piss if you need to,&quot; he instructed, &quot;It
  will be easier for you in here than trying to sit on the loo.&quot; Unlike
  Roz, I hadn't pissed on the floor during the caning and I really did need to
  go but I was reluctant with a man in the shower with me. &quot;Let it go,&quot; he
  went on. I did it kneeling in the shower pan but the water was still running
  so the piss was quickly flushed away. I looked up and found my face level with
  his hardening prick. If the circumstances had been different, I would have
  loved to have taken it in my mouth but tiredness and the ache in my arse that
  the injection had made bearable but not removed, all combined to disinterest
  me in it. 
&quot;Thanks,&quot; I croaked when Skip had dried me. After all the crying
  and screaming my throat was parched. &quot;Thanks,&quot; I muttered again when
  Skip had fed me what seemed like a gallon of fruit juice. Skip never dressed
  after the shower so I kept seeing his prick in all its glory but still I couldn't
  become aroused. I didn't even react when he climbed into bed and drew me into
  his arms and I felt my breasts flatten against his chest and his prick was
  pressed to my stomach. 
&quot;Just try and sleep Sandy. Don't be afraid to wake me if you need anything.&quot; Indeed
  I dozed off but seemed to wake every few minutes. Skip snored quietly and I
  felt secure in his arms. About four o'clock in the morning the pain came back
  with vengeance and I was forced to wake him. When he examined my arse he said
  it was inflamed and raw. I could have told him that! He put me in the shower
  again and donned a robe and went to find the nurse who came immediately. &quot;What
  do you think Patty?&quot; Skip asked. 
&quot;The water will help but I'll give her another injection and do use that
  cream when she's dried off a bit. I'll check on her before breakfast and if
  it's no better the doctor will have to see her. I'll have a look at the other
  one before I go back to bed.&quot; I noticed that she looked worried but said
  nothing. 
Careful though he was, I winced and cried out a couple of times when Skip
  put on the cream. Soon the injection kicked in and the pain became bearable
  once more and I slept until I felt Skip move. I had my arms around him and
  I could feel his prick still hard against my belly. &quot;Sorry,&quot; he said, &quot;I
  need to piss. You any better?&quot; 
&quot;Yeah. Arse sort of hurts but more of an ache. Must be the injection.
  Skip? Thanks for everything. Would you like to put that hard thing that's poking
  me in the navel in its right place?&quot; 
&quot;It will hurt you too much.&quot; 
&quot;Stop teasing me with it man. Put it in. Fuck me gently and I'll be okay.
  The other guests will make me do it later and they'll only be too pleased if
  it hurts.&quot; Fucking side by side isn't the easiest position at normal times,
  now Skip dare not even touch my arse to hold me in place so after a few futile
  thrusts I said, &quot;Help me to lie across the bed.&quot; I cried out a few
  times during the manoeuvre but I was soon kneeling on the floor with my body
  over the bed and my arse in the air ready for a doggy fuck. 
&quot;You're sure about this Sandy?&quot; Skip seemed concerned. 
&quot;Fuck me, Skip. Fuck me.&quot; His prick opened my cunt and slid in.
  Skip fucked me slowly at first and then when he saw I wasn't hurting too much,
  he did it more vigorously but only once did her go in to his full depth and
  hit my tender buttocks. It wasn't long before he climaxed. He must have known
  that I hadn't cum because he knelt down and sucked my clit until I shuddered
  and came with a cry. Helping me to my feet he kissed me and I could taste his
  juices and mine on his lips. 
&quot;I'd better piss now before I make a mess on the floor,&quot; he laughed. 
I saw him go in the bathroom and then leave the room. When he returned Patty
  was with him and he had my Roman tunic or another one like it. Patty looked
  at my arse and seemed more pleased with what she saw. &quot;Keep putting the
  cream on Skip, probably every couple of hours. The injection should last till
  lunchtime and I will give her another one then unless the doc says otherwise.&quot; Turning
  to me she said, &quot;I know it is painful to move but you should try and keep
  your muscles working. Walk around but don't overdo it.&quot; She paused for
  a few moments, &quot;Did getting fucked help too?&quot; she grinned when she
  asked and then to Skip went on, &quot;Be careful with her.&quot; He just grinned. 
&quot;How's Roz?&quot; I asked. 
&quot;Much the same as you although her welts aren't quite as extensive. Your
  buttocks were swollen and tight when they caned them.&quot; 
At Skip's suggestion, which was almost a command, I did get up, shower and
  dressed in the tunic although I only loosely laced it up. I seemed almost more
  naked than without any clothes at all. The lacing thrust out my tits and exposed
  most of them and my pubic hair and now my welts, showed with even small movements
  of the short skirt. My virtual nakedness seemed more pronounced as all the
  crew were fully dressed. 
We called in to see Roz. She was not in a good mood. Gladys had gone to breakfast
  so we were alone. &quot;So this is what you meant when you said that if they
  found out, they would only send us home!&quot; She started a prolonged verbal
  attack on me. I apologised really sincerely but still she railed on about my
  stupidity. &quot;We'll probably lose our jobs anyway because we won't be able
  to work for a while and after getting her arse beaten, Caroline is unlikely
  to want us in her department.&quot; There was no talking or reasoning with
  her so I went to the crew's dining room with Skip and although I didn't feel
  like eating the mugs of tea went down well. Everyone seemed concerned for my
  welfare and said they would do what they could to protect me from any further
  punishments. 
&quot;Why isn't Roz with you?&quot; a young sailor whose badge told me was
  called Nick, asked. 
&quot;She just lying on her bed and refuses to move,&quot; Gladys told him
  and I added that she was not a happy bunny with me when we looked in. 
&quot;Why don't you go in and cheer her up Nick?&quot; I suggested. &quot;She's
  supposed to move about a bit and she might do it if you help her. Put her in
  the shower and then bring her to breakfast. I daresay someone can find her
  one of these tunics. At least they're loose enough not to chafe too much even
  if they show more than I would consider proper. Don't take any nonsense from
  her Nick. She's a bit of a baby at times.&quot; 
&quot;Will someone cover for me in the dining hall?&quot; Nick asked. A couple
  volunteered. 
&quot;I'll look in on them in a short while,&quot; Gladys whispered, &quot;He
  should be alright with her but you never know with these young lads and a naked
  woman.&quot; She gave a little giggle, which I involuntarily returned. I couldn't
  help but notice how different our treatment was with the crew to that we had
  from the guests. 
I stayed at the crew's end of the ship all morning and tried again to speak
  with Roz when Nick brought her in an hour later. At first she wouldn't come
  near me but Nick put his arm around her shoulders and said, &quot;Your both
  in the same boat, literally and figuratively. Talk to her. She went though
  it the same as you did and worse, and you've known each other too long not
  to be friends and get through this.&quot; 
&quot;I'll show you mine if you'll show me yours,&quot; I said. It had a double
  meaning dating from the time when we were both starting to grow breasts. It
  had gone on for through our puberty years where we showed each other not only
  our tits but also our pubic hair, and our developing clit. It almost got a
  smile from her. I turned and lifted my tunic and winced a little when I bent
  over. I knew Nick and a couple of others in the saloon were getting an eyeful
  too but they'd seem more than that last night. 
&quot;Oh my God Sandy. I wonder you can stand up.&quot; 
&quot;I wouldn't be able to if it wasn't for the injection and another injection
  Skip gave me.&quot; 
&quot;Sandy you didn't! You slut!&quot; 
&quot;I did. Seemed a nice way to pay him for the care he's taken of me. I've
  also been moving around since breakfast. Your turn to show.&quot; 
She did a moony for me too and I could see how deeply embedded her welts were.
  I knew she was in pain too or would have been without the relief that the doctor's
  jab gave us. Nick made her coffee and talked to both of us for a while until
  he really had to report for duty. 
Skip had a brief period when he too was on duty but then was free until the
  cruise in the afternoon. I think the little walking I did helped me because
  when the doc came to check on me before lunch he almost didn't give me another
  shot but I protested and he gave in. 
&quot;Can I come with you on the cruise Skip? I can stand in the wheelhouse.
  I'd really like to get outside again.&quot; I pleaded and finally he agreed.
  However, my outdoor clothes seemed to have disappeared. 
&quot;No problem,&quot; Skip informed me, &quot;I'm sure we can find you a
  sailor's uniform and if we get you on the Petite Swan before the guests, no
  one should notice until it is too late. Probably won't be too many passengers
  because the wind has picked up a bit and the sea's got a bit of a lop on. It
  will be calmer in the river when we get under the lee of the docks.&quot; 
I have to say I looked quite attractive in my uniform. I tucked my blonde
  hair under the peaked cap and wore a pair of dark glasses so I was able to
  get down the landing stairs without any problem apart from the physical one
  of going down wet steps with a welted arse. I tried to make it appear that
  my slow progress was due to my trying to dodge the spray that came between
  the two boats every few minutes. Skip and I had to wear the regulation high
  visibility, life jackets that disguised my shape even more than the uniform.
  Over lunch in the crew's mess, Skip had tried to find out more of my experience
  of handling a small boat and seemed satisfied that I knew enough to control
  the Petite Swan for short periods anyway. In the wheelhouse he showed me the
  controls. &quot;When I cast off, nudge her into astern until we're clear of
  the gangway and then put in forward and swing away from the boat. By then I
  should be back in the wheelhouse.&quot; He knew I wouldn't have the agility
  to cast off and jump back into the wheelhouse. I remained by the wheel while
  Skip went back on board and kitted out the passengers with life jackets from
  a locker in the saloon. 
As it turned out, there were only four passengers willing to risk getting
  soaked getting down the gangway. Soon they were settled in the partially enclosed
  saloon and Skip went on the foredeck to cast off. I half expected him to take
  over when he clambered into the wheelhouse alongside me but he never bothered
  to take the wheel. &quot;Open her up a bit more and steer between those two
  buoys and then swing to port and get out into the main channel.&quot; Thereafter
  I steered the boat to his directions while he sat at the microphone and did
  the tour guide bit. I felt my legs and arse beginning to ache badly but I was
  enjoying myself especially at first when we were punching against the wind
  and tide into a choppy sea and the boat was bouncing a bit. One of the passengers
  looked a bit sick but I wasn't sorry for her. She could have been one of those
  that cheered when we were thrashed. However after about twenty minutes of that
  I was directed to turn into the mouth of a river where it was much calmer.
  Two hours later we arrived back and Skip showed his confidence in me by letting
  me bring the boat alongside while he grabbed the mooring rope. He helped the
  passengers on to the gangway while I pretended to tidy the wheelhouse. 
Skip locked up and I watched as he hung the keys on a nail hidden under the
  side deck. 
&quot;Thanks Skip,&quot; I said when we were back in the crew's mess. &quot;That's
  the first bit of this weekend that I have enjoyed although I think my arse
  needs some more cream.&quot; 
&quot;I could see you enjoyed yourself,&quot; Skip grinned, &quot;Especially
  when you were trying to make that woman sick.&quot; Roz looked at me as if
  I was crazy for going out when the sea was as rough as it was. She could see
  the spray whipping passed the portholes. 
&quot;It's put some colour in your cheeks anyway. Were you trying to colour
  match them to your bum?&quot; Skip laughed. &quot;And do you want cream inside
  or outside your arse?&quot; 
&quot;Both please.&quot; 
Roz mouthed, &quot;Slut!&quot; but I went to Skip's berth and let him fuck
  me like he did earlier. 
After dinner, Roz and I were trying to keep out of the way in case they wanted
  us to be the after dinner entertainment again. We'd been in a little cubby-hole
  that the crew used to store material when Karen one of the maids came in looking
  very worried and almost in tears. &quot;Where's Skip?&quot; she demanded. I
  told her and a few minutes later they both came in to the store. 
&quot;It's more serious than we thought, Sandy. Tell them Karen.&quot; Skip
  looked very worried. 
&quot;Well I was going along a corridor to room 34 to answer a call when one
  of the guests grabbed me and started to fondle my tits. They're not supposed
  to do that to us but provided they don't go too far, we usually take it in
  good part and don't cause a scene. I felt a piece of paper push down my cleavage
  so I thought someone wanted an assignment that night. We're not supposed to
  allow guests to have sex with us but normally everyone turns a blind eye to
  it and we usually get a good tip. However this was the note. 
Warn the two girls they are in danger. I overheard plans to dump them
    'in the narrows where the tide rip will take their bodies out to sea and
    it will be weeks before they are found.' I didn't hear any more but I do
    not wish to be party to murder, the thrashing they had last night was far
    too much for the trivial offence. 
There was no signature. &quot;It was the nice guy with the pot belly, the
  one with the wife that wants two dicks in her every time,&quot; Karen said. &quot;What
  are we going to do? No one here will let them hurt you two any more so they'll
  have to do it when we're not around.&quot; 
&quot;First we hide them away. There's plenty of places on this ship no one
  knows about so I doubt if they will be found especially if the crew knows where
  not to look!&quot; Unfortunately those places won't have the comforts you have
  even in this store.&quot; 
&quot;Keep this completely to yourself Karen,&quot; Skip ordered as he pocketed
  the note. &quot;No one else must know for the time being.&quot; 
Skip was about to lead us through a steel door when Gladys came into the mess, &quot;Griff
  wants you to go back to your own cabin and change into the tunics you were
  given,&quot; she told us. 
&quot;You haven't seen us Gladys. Spend some time looking around all the possible
  places you would normally check and report back that they cannot be found.
  Tell you more later.&quot; Skip took charge of the situation and changed his
  mind about going through the steel door. Instead he took us to an empty cabin
  on a lower deck. Roz and I lay on the bed, Skip sat in a chair re-reading the
  note and seemed to be thinking. 
&quot;What does the note mean?&quot; I asked. 
&quot;The narrows is a shallow channel between two sand banks and for about
  two hours after high water, all the water from the mud flats and the estuary
  behind flows through it creating a very fast current or rip tide as many call
  it. After a couple of hours the ebbing tide dries out the channel so it is
  no longer usable even by small boats. High water today was about three hours
  or so ago and it's still daylight so they won't do anything until the early
  hours of the morning. They would have to dump you in the channel about three
  or four in the morning and it won't matter if you're dead or alive, unless
  you're very lucky you'll be swept out to sea and gone forever.&quot; Both Roz
  and myself started crying and Skip put his hand on my cheek and said, &quot;That's
  not going to happen though. Griff and probably his cohort Jack Anderson will
  be behind this so we'll try and keep you away from them.&quot; 
For a while Skip sat and said nothing and then he looked up, &quot;This is
  my idea. You may not like it but it's the best I can come up with. We don't
  want them to suspect we know anything of their plans for you so first you will
  let yourselves be found and join in the party. That's what you came for and
  I doubt they will do anything except have sex with you and probably humiliate
  you some. I'll get the staff to watch out for you and if they try to hurt you
  again, they'll have a rebellion on their hands. Most of the security people
  will be on your side although I will not tell them about the note. While you're
  in public view nothing life threatening will happen. When the party closes
  at midnight or before, then we will have to watch over you very closely.&quot; 
&quot;I found them,&quot; Skip called out to Gladys when we returned to the
  crew's mess. &quot;I'll have a word with security and the crew to keep a special
  watch over you. They won't interfere unless things get really out of hand,&quot; Skip
  whispered. 
We entered the main saloon to cheers and applause. Griff came forward and
  greeted us like honoured guests. &quot;Welcome to the party girls. Perhaps
  you would care to join Jack and myself at our table.&quot; 
Someone shouted, &quot;Let's see their arses! I'm sure they're a pretty sight.&quot; 
&quot;I'm sure they'll oblige us will a little look, won't you girls,&quot; Griff
  went on amicably. &quot;In fact I'll bring them round and you can all see and
  feel them. Jack would you care to escort the delightful Roz while I take this
  saucy minx?&quot; 
I thought about protesting and I am sure Roz did as well but that could have
  led to further punishment. At each table I had to bend over while Griff held
  my skirt out of the way. Some guests probed into my holes and touched my welts
  roughly but most seemed a bit sympathetic. Caroline had an extra cushion on
  her chair so I knew she was still a bit tender too and I doubted they had given
  her any injections. She poked a finger in my cunt and said, &quot;Perhaps now
  you will keep out of my affairs, that is if you decide to continue working
  at Masons.&quot; 
&quot;Why don't you show her what her irresponsible actions did to your bottom
  Caroline?&quot; Griff suggested, &quot;Maybe she will even try and kiss it
  better. Lean right over the table dear so she can kiss you properly.&quot; Griff
  and another guest cleared some glasses from the table and, with some hesitation,
  Caroline bent herself over it and spread her legs for me. Her arse was one
  dark mauve-yellow bruise and it still looked very painful. I noticed dried
  semen around her arsehole and fresh semen leaking from her cunt. Obviously
  the pain hadn't stopped her being fucked but I didn't know whether she was
  forced into fucking or whether she did it voluntarily. 
&quot;It certainly looks as if she can do with a good clean up. Get you tongue
  right in there and get her ready for her next prick.&quot; Griff emphasised
  his instruction by giving my arse a squeeze and pushing my face against her
  cunt. I'd expected to have sex with both men and women when I came to the party
  so I started licking and sucking and continued until she climaxed. 
&quot;Perhaps I will keep you on after all,&quot; Caroline grinned when she
  was able to seat herself again. &quot;I could get to enjoy having you kneel
  under my desk with your head between my thighs and your tongue performing on
  my cunt like that. It would help take some of the stress away.&quot; 
At the next table an elderly woman was bouncing slowly on the prick of a much
  younger man. She felt my cunt and remarked, &quot;You need a good fucking girl.
  I'm sure Griff we see that you well attended to this evening. Perhaps one of
  the studs you've got hidden away for later Griff?&quot; I guessed they'd hired
  in some men with over large pricks. &quot;Suck my tits,&quot; she ordered.
  It was a little difficult to do with her bouncing up and down but I managed
  to latch on to a nipple but shortly afterwards the man shot his load and I
  was ordered to lick her clean and then I had to suck him. 
When I moved on I saw Roz had a prick in her mouth and wasn't looking too
  unhappy. Twice before I completed my round I was bent over a table and fucked
  forcibly. Both men thrust in as hard and as far as possible to cause me the
  maximum pain as each hit my arse with their loins. I contrasted this with the
  careful fucking Skip had given me. Finally I arrived back at Griff's table.
  Jack and Roz were already there and Roz was trying to find a comfortable position
  on his lap. Griff poured me a glass of wine but I hardly had it to my lips
  when the doctor came and took it away. &quot;Sorry,&quot; he apologised, &quot;It
  will react with the jabs and you'll be sick as a dog. Sorry Griff, I had to
  do that otherwise you could have an unpleasant session.&quot; I had hoped to
  use the alcohol to obliterate my mind as to what was going on. It didn't seem
  possible that the affable Griff of this moment was actually planning to murder
  us. 
&quot;Sit on my prick like Gracie was doing to her man,&quot; Griff demanded.
  I guessed Gracie was the older woman and I copied what she had done. Griff
  though wanted me to do it harder and used his hands on my tender arse until
  I cried out. Fortunately we were interrupted by a maid who informed Griff that
  the entertainers had arrived and were backstage and ready to start. He dumped
  me on the chair causing me more pain for which he apologised and went on stage
  and picked up the microphone. 
&quot;Ladies and Gentlemen, for your entertainment we have the brother and
  sister pair Garth and Eva. I know all you like to try out different positions
  when you fuck but I am sure none will be able to compete with these contortionists.
  Watch carefully but as the saying is, 'Don't try this at home'! Ladies and
  Gentlemen, please welcome Garth and Eva.&quot; 
A lithe pair came on stage naked and started into a routine with Eva thrusting
  her sex out with her legs behind her neck and Garth entering her while arched
  backwards. From then on they moved from one seemingly impossible contortion
  to another and each time he managed to enter her cunt, arse or mouth. They
  ended their act to a hearty round of deserved applause. Griff thanked them
  and repeated his warning for the guests not to try what they did at home. He
  went on, &quot;Eva and Garth have agreed to one guest of each sex to sit with
  them during the next part of the show and I guess that will not stop at just
  sitting.&quot; Everyone laughed. He held up the two bags with the bingo balls
  and drew a ball from each and called out the numbers of the lucky winners. 
&quot;As most of you know, one man can with a lot of effort, keep a woman
  happy; two men stand a better chance and if the men are above average in prick
  size the chances are greater still. I have been fortunate in obtaining the
  services of two such studs that have worked together as a team for several
  years and have proved to many audiences that two into one will go, thank you
  very much. May I introduce you to Mark and John.&quot; The pair came on stage
  and then strutted between the tables so everyone had a good view of their massive
  pricks jutting out from their bodies. I wondered how any woman could take one
  of them inside her vagina but they were going to screw her arse at the same
  time. Griff continued, &quot;Unfortunately because they and our contortionists
  have to return tonight and the tide problem at Brightwell they will only be
  able to give one performance. Who will be the lucky lady that is selected?
  It was a difficult choice to make but the two boys said they preferred their
  women young and tight and I thought that perhaps we were a little harsh on
  the two gatecrashers last night so I selected the one that went to such great
  lengths to get here. Boys, may I introduce you to Sandy.&quot; 
I yelled &quot;No,&quot; but with everyone else cheering and hands gripping
  my arms I was led to a narrow bed on the stage and my tunic was stripped off. 
&quot;As you can see boys, she likes a bit of pain,&quot; he indicated my
  arse and although I shook my head I think the boys believed him, &quot;So do
  it to her as you would to whoever is offered to you at your stage shows. Ignore
  her little squeals. She wants it and has been dying to get a prick inside her
  that was bigger than most of us can offer her.&quot; 
&quot;Are you sure about this?&quot; John asked Griff. 
&quot;Yes, there'll be no come backs and you are being paid over the odds.&quot; I
  shuddered at the reply. 
&quot;There you are Sandy,&quot; Griff spoke into the mike again, &quot;You
  wormed your way in to a sex party to enjoy pleasures you couldn't get at home,
  now enjoy them.&quot; 
I still kept pleading no but I felt Vaseline or something being rubbed into
  my arse and first one finger penetrated and then a second. It hurt but I hoped
  the jabs I'd had would dull the pain. Mark lifted my hips so I was in doggie
  mode and then painfully pulled my arse cheeks apart so John had full access
  to my hole. I cried out and John paused. &quot;Do it John, do it hard,&quot; Griff
  urged, &quot;It's a fake rape scene and she's playing it up.&quot; I guess
  sex won out over caution as John slowly forced his enormous member inside me.
  I yelled and screamed but all to no avail. Soon he was fully embedded in my
  arse but he didn't start fucking. I was lowered flat on the bed and rolled
  over so I was face up with John underneath. His hands cupped my tits and his
  prick remained inside my bum hole. Mark then entered my cunt. There hardly
  seemed room for him to get in with my arse already plugged but he thrust and
  forced his way up my passage until I felt his hair against mine. With a practiced
  movement I was now rolled on to my side and, sandwiched between the two boys,
  they began a steady rhythmic but very painful fuck. I suppose that if I hadn't
  already been sore and if I had more experience with that size prick, I could
  well have enjoyed it. They had definitely perfected a timing technique that
  should have given a girl a lot of pleasure. Maybe towards the end I did get
  a little pleasure out of it but mostly there was more pain that I could take.
  I felt my head going a little woozy again but I didn't pass out. 
First John and then Mark came inside me and they waited a little while before
  withdrawing. Their softening pricks were offered to my mouth at the same time
  but I could only take one and then the other. They didn't seem to like my tears
  wetting their pubic hair. A number of ladies came around and fondled the huge
  pricks but Skip came in a spoke with Griff, &quot;I must leave with the performers
  now sir, otherwise they will have to stay the night. I doubt if they will fancy
  going in the small launch in the rough water.&quot; I wondered if he'd watched
  the show and felt embarrassed that he'd seen me. Griff took me back to his
  table and publicly fucked my arse but after having John, I hardly felt it.
  I noticed other couples were fucking in various ways but the evening seemed
  to be winding down and people were making their way to their cabins, no doubt
  for further sex. I was worn right out from my ordeal and could hardly walk
  without help when Griff suggested Jack and he came to our cabin. I don't know
  why, but I picked up my tunic and put it on. 
Both of them were sexually used up by then but they fondled our tits and made
  us suck them for a while. A little after midnight Griff stood and said, &quot;I've
  got to lock up. Everyone should be out of the saloon by now. Look after this
  pair Jack, see they entertain you and don't let them out of your sight.&quot; 
&quot;I won't Griff. We don't want to lose them just yet.&quot; From our knowledge
  of what might happen and the sly grin Jack had on his face when he answered,
  both Roz and I knew whatever they were planning, was going to happen shortly.
  I knew we had to take some action now. For a short while at least it was two
  against one. I went to the loo and looked around for a suitable weapon but
  all I could find was a tall glass bottle containing bath salts. &quot;It will
  have to do,&quot; I said to myself. Had he been looking through the open door
  he would have seen me pick it up but before he looked at me, I had concealed
  it in a towel. 
Roz started crying yet again. &quot;What's the matter now?&quot; Jack asked. 
&quot;Are we going to be allowed home tomorrow?&quot; Roz sobbed. At least
  she had his attention. 
&quot;Of course you are, you'll�&quot; He didn't finish the sentence because
  I took a sideways swipe at his head. He fell to the floor with blood coming
  from a gash where the bottle had hit. Roz shouted hysterically that I had killed
  him but I slapped her face and ordered her to get the bedside lamp. With the
  lead I tied his hands behind his back and then I gagged him with the towel.
  There was no sign of our clothes so I decided we'd just have to brave the cold.
  I grabbed Roz and then found the door locked. Fortunately Jack also had master
  keys so I used them and escaped. I wanted to see Skip but if Griff had gone
  to the saloon, I would have to pass him so I headed to the fore end of the
  ship and came to a steel door. It wasn't locked but it was bolted and the handles
  were very stiff to turn. With a strength I didn't know I had and a little help
  from Roz I slowly opened the door. It seemed to creak loudly but no one was
  around. From the wind and the noise of the sea I knew we were now on the outside
  of the ship. A half moon revealed itself for a few moments between scudding
  clouds but it was enough for me to see where I was. The wind seemed to freeze
  our skin but we had no time to think of that. I held Roz's hand and dragged
  her along the deck in the shadow of the lifeboats to where I knew the Petite
  Swan should be tied up. As we approached I could hear Griff's voice. &quot;Did
  you get the keys man?&quot; 
&quot;I'm sorry sir, Skip seems to have disappeared. We think he may be wanting
  to get that Sandy into his bed again.&quot; I could just make out the silhouette
  of a security guard. 
&quot;Damn the man,&quot; Griff swore a few more oaths and then yelled, &quot;You
  go back to the crew's quarters and check again, I'll go to their cabin. Hurry
  man.&quot; 
As soon as they'd disappeared from sight I ordered Roz to follow me and get
  a move on. We ignored the spray that soaked us before we reached the boat and
  I indicated Roz should sit in the saloon while I cast off the line, praying
  that Skip had left the keys on the nail. In any case the strong tide would
  quickly sweep us away from the ship and out to sea. As I clambered along the
  side deck into the cockpit, I looked up and saw the large letters &quot;Sensuous
  Swan&quot; on the stern of the ship as we drifted rapidly and helplessly away.
  Our progress was helped by the strong wind but that brought with it other dangers.
  It swept us broadside on to the waves and made the small boat roll alarmingly
  and we were in imminent danger of being swamped unless I could get the engine
  running. &quot;Where's that bloody key,&quot; I swore out loud. In the darkness
  I couldn't seem to find the nail let alone the key. &quot;Don't panic!&quot; I
  ordered myself. &quot;Start feeling further forward and run your hands along
  each of the side beams in turn. Miraculously I found it and then had to make
  the perilous journey to the wheelhouse. Twice I slipped but somehow managed
  to a keep grip on the handrail even though my hands were now really cold. It
  seemed to take ages for to unlock the wheelhouse door and when it slid open
  I fell in a heap onto the floor. Looking through the panel separating the wheelhouse
  from the saloon I could just make out Roz huddled in a corner and heard her
  moaning and being sick on the wet floor. Seeing me she shouted, &quot;It would
  be better to have died back there than to die like this.&quot; She whimpered
  again as she shook and shivered in the cold. 
&quot;We're not dead yet, and we're not going to die if I have anything to
  do with it,&quot; I shouted at her. Luckily at that moment the moon choose
  to show itself again and I could see the crazily spinning steering wheel. I
  grabbed it and hauled myself to my feet and fumbled to find the keyhole. Seconds
  later I was relieved to hear the throaty roar of the engine as it sprang to
  life. Slowly I brought the boat round into the wind and headed back past the
  Sensuous Swan towards Brightwell. We were nearly there when I remembered about
  the depth of water there and also thought they could come after us in the launch
  and I couldn't get into my car without my keys. &quot;It will safer to head
  for Hemmingstowe,&quot; I reasoned, &quot;They won't dare cross the stretch
  of open sea in the launch.&quot; I watched the water and in a relatively calm
  patch, swung the wheel and headed for a buoy with a twinkling green light.
  I hoped it was one that I'd seen earlier. 
Now the excitement of getting the Petite Swan underway was over, the cold
  hit me and I started shivering almost uncontrollably. The pain in my arse was
  starting to come back too and I knew the movements I'd made to get the key
  and into the wheelhouse had no doubt pulled muscles that were already sore.
  Added to this were the knocks and bruises I sustained when thrown about by
  the rough seas. The last injection must be wearing off too. I remembered the
  torch stashed in a holder by the wheelhouse door and switched it on. It worked
  and illuminated a row of switches. I flipped on the ones marked 'sidelights'
  and 'console' so I could see and read the compass. My brain was functioning
  but I found it difficult to control my body. Rounding the buoy I set a course
  to the north-east and eventually was able to get the boat to maintain that
  course with a loop of rope around one spoke of the wheel. 
Opening the panel to the saloon I yelled to Roz, &quot;Look in the locker
  over there. You'll find some life jackets and maybe some waterproof clothing
  or something.&quot; I poked the torch at her but she didn't move. I shone it
  full in her face and when she stirred I repeated the order twice before she
  crawled slowly across the floor. The boat was a little more stable now that
  we were running before the wind and I wasn't pushing the speed. For a while
  my attention was taken with crossing a container ship using the sea lane and
  it was some minutes before I was able to look at Roz again. By then she had
  life jackets strewn over the floor and was pulling some overalls from the locker
  and I could see some bright yellow cagoulle type waterproofs. She passed me
  a pair of overalls and I took off the now more than useless Roman tunic and
  put them on. They were much too big but they were dry and much warmer than
  the tunic. With the trousers and sleeves rolled up I could move around without
  tripping. When I next looked back Roz was struggling to do the same. I took
  a yellow cagoulle from her and wore that over the top of the overalls and slowly
  my shivering eased and I began to take more of an interest in my surroundings.
  I had to avoid several large vessels going into the docks and then headed up
  the river. The moon only gave me short glimpses of the scene but between them
  and the buoys I made my way upstream in the relatively calm water until I came
  to some moorings. I decided to try and tie up there and wait until daylight
  before going on because I knew the channel got narrower and was cluttered with
  other boats. It would have helped if Roz could have worked the engine but I
  knew she wouldn't want to move from the corner where she sat still shivering
  and weeping. I cut the speed down until we barely crept over the tide until
  I came to a bright orange buoy. My first attempt at getting it was foiled by
  a gust of wind blowing us away at the last moment and I had to return to the
  wheelhouse to line the boat up again. Fortunately at the second attempt I got
  the painter through the eye and secured us. 
&quot;Will they come after us?&quot; Roz asked when I sat and cuddled her
  in saloon. 
&quot;I doubt if they can. They only have the small launch and they wouldn't
  try and cross the open bit of sea in that, not in this wind. In any case they
  will probably expect us to head for Brightwell unless they saw me turn and
  head back.&quot; We talked about what we were going to do and Roz seemed worried
  that Jack might die but I reminded her there was a doctor on board and Jack
  was moaning pretty loud when I gagged him. 
We dozed cuddled in each other's arms for a few hours but the pain in our
  arses was getting bad and I could feel other sore places on my body and knew
  we would have to get help soon. I cried out when I tried to stand. It was getting
  light but I didn't really feel like moving. Roz cried out when I moved and
  went outside. The wind had dropped as little and all was quiet. Everything
  seemed peaceful with no hint of the terror that had gone on only a few miles
  away. Removing my cagoulle and life jacket and lowering my overalls I peed
  into a bucket and rinsed it away over the side. Roz watched me and then moaned
  as she moved and tried to perform in the bucket. I looked in the small first
  aid box and found a tube of burn cream and put some on her arse and then she
  did the same for me. She said my welts were badly chafed which wasn't surprising
  after the activity of the previous few hours. 
&quot;What are you going to do now?&quot; she asked. 
&quot;When I can move a bit easier, I take us up to Hemmingstowe and call
  the police.&quot; 
&quot;Don't you have a radio on this thing?&quot; 
I could have kicked myself for not thinking of it. We hadn't needed or used
  it on the cruise the previous day but I had seen it in the wheelhouse. However
  my mind on the escape trip was more concerned with getting the boat under control
  and getting away and in the blackness I had completely forgotten the radio.
  In fact most of the boats I'd sailed on were day boats and didn't have radios
  but I'd been on several cruises where they were used although I didn't have
  personal experience with them. &quot;Some sea woman you are,&quot; I scolded
  myself. For a little while I hobbled back and forth along the saloon floor
  and into the cockpit trying to make my buttock muscles work without too much
  pain. I had just about decided that I could climb on to the side deck and make
  my way to the wheelhouse when I saw a fishing boat chugging its way up river
  causing the moored boats to rock with some violence. &quot;I better let that
  pass first,&quot; I said to Roz, &quot;Otherwise the wake might throw me off.&quot; 
Much to my surprise, the fishing boat slowed as it neared us and then eased
  its way alongside. Immediately I recognised Skip at the wheel and Nick on the
  foredeck. Deftly Nick jumped onto to the Petite Swan and tied the fishing boat
  to us. Two other men secured lines at our stern. Skip came aboard and I hugged
  him for a long while. 
&quot;How did you know we would be here?&quot; I asked. 
&quot;Guesswork and a little intuition,&quot; he laughed and tapped his nose
  a few times. &quot;Are you okay?&quot; 
&quot;Yeah, apart from a sore arse from the belting and caning, apart from
  bruises on almost every part of my body from being thrown around this tub for
  half the night, apart from being cold and utterly weary, yeah, I'm fine.&quot; I
  smiled weakly and then felt my head spinning and had it not been for Skip's
  arms, I would have sunk to the floor. It took only a few moments for me to
  recover but I could see the concern on Skip's face. 
&quot;We'll get them to hospital before you question them,&quot; he said to
  one of the two other men. To me he added, &quot;They're from Customs and Excise
  and they've been watching the Sensuous Swan for some time.&quot; 
Roz and I were transferred to the &quot;Sprightly Sprat&quot; and I noticed
  she never let go of Nick. &quot;I brought the cream the doc used,&quot; Skip
  informed me when we were in a cabin. 
&quot;You only want to feel my arse again,&quot; I tried to joke but without
  thinking about the two customs officers I unzipped the overalls and bared my
  bum. Understandably they were extremely shocked by the sight. 
&quot;Payment to Griff Normansen for gate crashing his party,&quot; Skip informed
  them. Nick treated Roz and I could see her welts were sore and red from the
  effects of the journey. I expected mine to be worse. 
One of the customs men remained on the Petite Swan when Skip put the Sprightly
  Sprat into gear and headed up river. &quot;Why did you bring the customs bods
  along?&quot; I asked Skip after I'd pushed him aside and took the wheel. 
&quot;As I said, they've been watching the Griff and Jack for some time not
  because of the sex parties but because they believed he was also using the
  boat as temporary housing for illegal immigrants and as a base for drug smuggling.&quot; 
The pain in my arse seemed to be increasing but I didn't want to give up the
  wheel and be made to lie down on a bunk. Luckily Skip sensed this and stood
  behind me and, wrapping his arms around my body, held the wheel with me until
  we reached Hemmingstowe. An ambulance was waiting and Roz and I were taken
  to hospital accompanied by the customs official who said his name was Sidney
  Gatsby. Skip had to return his boat but promised to see me that evening. 
&quot;Sorry,&quot; Sidney apologised, &quot;I don't believe you had anything
  to do with the Normansen operation but I have to officially keep watch on you
  until my boss clears you.&quot; I hardly heard him as I dozed seemingly safe
  in the hands of the paramedics and lying on a soft stretcher. Roz was also
  nearly asleep but Nick was there holding her hand. I felt cheated that Skip
  had left me and yet Nick had stayed. However I forgave him when he came to
  the hospital that evening and brought a lovely bunch of flowers. 
Roz and I popped into work the following week. We'd only been kept in hospital
  for three days. Officially we were still on sick leave but Caroline pleaded
  with us to come in a see her. After the usual greetings she asked, &quot;How
  are your bottoms now? I can see you're not walking easily.&quot; 
&quot;I'll show you mine if you'll show me yours,&quot; I replied no longer
  caring if she did sack me. 
&quot;Roz too?&quot; she enquired. Roz nodded and I went and locked the door
  and lifted my skirt. Tight knickers were still a no-no against the sore flesh.
  Caroline did seem horrified when she saw mine. It was now eleven days since
  our thrashing and the welts were still deep and red even with all the ointments
  we'd put on them. Very tentatively she touched me and I had to stifle a moan.
  Roz didn't even try not to cry out. 
Caroline's arse, whilst still bruised and discoloured, was far less painful.
  Afterwards she sat and offered us cushioned seats. &quot;The real reason for
  asking you here was not to see your bums but to make you an offer. One of the
  guests is a top judge and as you probably know, many of the others are top
  people in industry. We can't do much to save Griff and Jack from a long term
  inside for drug and immigrant smuggling, indeed they are doing all they can
  to ensure they get the maximum sentence. They do want to hush up what went
  on at the party and they asked me to get your word not to blabber to the press.
  In reality only a handful of guests enjoyed seeing you thrashed like that.
  They came for extra sex, not to witness torture. I'm only a lowly person on
  the guest list but my sponsor is much higher up the echelons of power and many
  have complained to him.&quot; 
&quot;What's in it for us?&quot; I asked. 
&quot;You will remain on the staff of the Masons Group at full pay for two
  years with the nominal title of Outside Recruitment Officers. Your wages will
  be paid into your bank accounts as now but you won't have to actually come
  in to work. Thereafter you will be paid a pension of one-third of your wages.&quot; 
&quot;Why not pay us fully all the time?&quot; 
The reasoning is that after two years you will be fully recovered and the
  news would be more or less stale and most guests will have had time to cover
  up any involvement. According to the doctor, you should be recovered long before
  the two years and able to work anywhere without problems.&quot; 
&quot;Except the psychological ones. I still have nightmares,&quot; Roz whimpered. 
&quot;I do too,&quot; I admitted. 
&quot;Would you like me to see if the doc will agree to send you for treatment?
  I'm sure they'll know who is the best in that field.&quot; Caroline suggested.
  Roz agreed but I wasn't so keen on seeing a shrink. 
&quot;Are we agreed on these terms?&quot; Caroline asked after we had discussed
  the proposal for some time. She looked very relieved when we agreed and she
  even smiled and asked if we would like to visit her at home. Both of us declined. 
Two weeks later, after Skip had well and truly fucked me in his cottage on
  the Nazeby waterfront, I asked him about what happened on the evening of our
  escape. So far it had all been hushed up and kept from us but now Griff and
  Jack had been charged with various crimes including the drugs and people smuggling,
  it was becoming more public. No one mentioned any attempted murder allegations. 
&quot;Frank Fellows, the bloke we left on the Petite Swan, has been a friend
  of mine since our school years and when he knew I did part time work on the
  Sensuous he asked me to keep an eye on the happenings there. He gave me a special
  phone to contact him and I reported in to him when I was alone on the return
  trip from taking the entertainers to Brightwell. I told them about the plot
  to kill you probably by drowning you and they alerted the lifeboat crew so
  unless you were actually dead before you left the Sensuous you would have stood
  a chance of being picked up, at least you would have had the weather been calmer.
  When security came and asked for the keys I told him to report that he couldn't
  find me. I went to your cabin and when I found it locked, I burst the door
  open and saw Jack, bleeding but very much alive. I thought at first you might
  be hiding in one of the other rooms like earlier but even when I had all the
  crew looking, no one could find you. My heart sank when I went on deck and
  saw you drifting astern and being tossed about by the waves. I knew you to
  be a capable woman on a boat but in what is basically an open boat, without
  power, things looked desperate. Griff shouted and wanted me to get the launch
  and go after you but I refused and when he tried to punch me I floored him.
  Security took him away. You seemed to take an age to get the engine going and
  several times I thought the boat must have gone under but you were too far
  away by then to see in the darkness. &quot; 
&quot;I couldn't find the bloody key! And then it was hell's own job to get
  into the wheelhouse with virtually no clothes on and with water threatening
  to wash me away. I still don't know how I managed it. I knocked my arse so
  many times I thought I would die from the pain first.&quot; 
&quot;With Nick's help I started to clear the covers from the launch and swing
  her in the davits but by then you had the engine going. You had me fooled when
  you passed us headed for Brightwell. I contacted Frank and he arranged for
  the local bobby to wait at the quayside but he reported you hadn't arrived
  so my next guess was that you would use the route we took for the cruise and
  spotted you when you put the navigation lights on. Nick was alongside me worrying
  about Roz and he helped me drop the launch from the davits and came with me
  to my fishing boat. It was a rough and wet trip in the small boat but we made
  it. Frank and Sid said to wait for them. At first I said, 'No way!' but they
  ordered me and I figured that you would by that time have gained the river
  and be relatively safe. You know the rest.&quot; 
&quot;Yeah and it looks as if all the guests are going to get away without
  any charges being brought against them. Sex between consenting adults is not
  a crime. Some big money handouts and not the least of them to me. I won't have
  to work again for a while and neither will Roz but I think I'll look for a
  little recreational work, perhaps as crew on a small fishing boat that takes
  parties of anglers out when the weather is good?&quot; 
&quot;There could be a place for such a person on the Sprightly Sprat but
  much of her onshore work would be done on her back,&quot; Skip grinned. &quot;Do
  you want an try out for the job?&quot; 
&quot;Uummm, yes. It feels so nice to be able to lie down again and fuck normally.
  Still hurts if I sit on a hard chair but lying on a soft bed with a hard prick
  inside me is fine. Just fine.&quot;
