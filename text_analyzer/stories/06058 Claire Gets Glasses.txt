Synopsis: Claire learns a painful lesson when she forgets to wear her glasses.






Claire gets glasses
�
Claire was unsure how she felt about her new glasses. � On one hand they were very cute, having been both the most expensive pair at the store.&nbsp; And they did look good on her- she was one of those people who looked good either with or without glasses- same went for hats, but these days who actually wears hats anymore. � But on the other hand, it was a sign that she was getting older and they were a pain to always remember to have with her.� 

Not that she needed them always, just when she was reading or working on the computer, which to tell you the truth was most of the time. 

If she didn't wear them, she would get bad headaches and have problems sleeping, which is what she was dealing with at the moment. � Tossing and turning in bed, she tried not to wake up Master.� He would be very upset that she wasn't sleeping again. � 

As she turned to lie on her back, she heard Him say, "Baby what's wrong?" 

"Nothing, I just have a little headache."

"Did you take anything for it?" He said sleepily, already knowing the answer. 

"Of course not, that would be what a sane person would do. � I forgot, but will go get something now." Claire said with a bit of a exasperated sigh.� It wasn't that she tried not to take care of herself, she just didn't think about it. � Or thought about it and then got distracted with something else.

"Don't worry baby, I will get it for you." He said, shaking the sleep from his head a bit and getting up to go to the medicine cabinet. � He couldn't believe that after all of this time, she still refused to take medication when she wasn't feeling well.� 

He used to discipline her for it, but thought she had gotten better. � Now He realized that He would need to be a bit more diligent.

He returned with the tablets and water, sitting on her side of the bed, while she took them. �Looking her in the eye, He asked her if she knew where the headache came from.� She said she didn't really know, it had just been there most of the evening. 

"Well I saw you were reading a lot today, did you wear your glasses?" He asked questioningly. 

"No, I forgot to put them on. � I still haven't gotten used to wearing them."
"Now Claire, you know better than that- the doctor said that they were causing the headaches. � You were reading all day, and now you have one- don't you think they could be connected?" He asked a bit annoyed.

"Probably", she said quietly looking down and her hands. 

"Probably?"

"Ok, yes.� I am sorry. � I promise I will start wearing them when I am suppose to." 
She said in her little girl voice she liked to use to try to manipulate him.

"Well you better or else you backside will pay for your bad behavior. � Starting tomorrow, anytime I catch you on the computer or reading a book without them, you are going to get a sound spanking."

"But.."

"No buts.� Didn't we buy you the nicest glasses at the shop- two pairs if I am not mistaken?" 

"Yes Sir"

"And did you promise Me that you would wear them if I bought them, especially as our insurance plan wouldn't cover the full price?" 

"Yes Sir"

"And are you keeping to that promise?"

"No Sir"

"Then we are going to try a new method, one that has immediate consequences for your bad behavior." 

Claire looked down at her hands, a bit upset. � She hadn't meant to disappoint Him.� Everything He said was true- she had promised to wear them and so far, she was doing a pretty bad job at it.

"I am really sorry.� I am not trying not to wear them."

"Baby I know you aren't, but you need to wear them so these headaches will stop. � Do you want to have the headaches?"

"No"
"Then we need to make sure you wear the glasses, and if the only way is for me to punish you went you don't, then that is what I am going to do. � Now, it is late, and we need to get some sleep."

He tucked her in, went around to his side of the bed, hopped in, pulled her to him and went to sleep�. 
�
Over the next few days Claire had been very good at remembering to wear her glasses; she was quite proud of herself and actually found she was getting used to the feel of the weight on her nose and ears. � She was actually relieved that she wouldn't be getting a spanking.� Claire actually loved being spanked erotically and her Master was always in the mood to indulge her, but his punishment spankings were very severe and left her struggling to sit for days. � �
On Friday, Claire went to the mall and was delighted to find the new book by her favorite author. � The book was the final in a series that she had been reading for years, and she was excited to get home and tear into it.� Claire was one of these people who loved reading so much; she would curl up in a chair for hours, only coming up for air when nature called. � As soon as she got home, Claire settled down on the couch to read it.� She got several chapters into it, when she realized she wasn't wearing her glasses, they were upstairs next to the bed. � Claire thought about going up and getting them, but it was so far away and she was so warm and comfortable snuggled up on the couch. Anyway Master wouldn't be home for hours, so she really had nothing to worry about. � Buried back in her book, Claire paid no attention to the passing of time, or the fact that is was getting dark out, and harder to read, until she heard the front door open and close. ��Quickly she looked around for somewhere to hide the book and put it behind a cushion on the couch, just as Master walked in.� She tried not to look too guilty as she said hello. 

" How was your day Sir?" she inquired

Puzzled by the covers on the couch and the darkness of the room, he asked her what she had been doing over the course of the day. 

"Nothing really, I just woke from a nap actually." 

"Well that is nice.�� So what are we having for dinner tonight?� I am surprised I can't smell anything cooking." 

(oh, she thought to herself) "Well I was thinking it would be nice to order in Indian food tonight, so I was just waiting until you got home to find out what you wanted." Wondering if he would be fooled. 

"That sounds like a good idea. � Are you sure everything is ok?� You seem a little jumpy"
"Yes, of course, you just startled me."

"Well I certainly didn't mean to do that. � Now scoot over and let me have a seat on the couch."
�
Terrified that he would find the book behind the pillow, she moved over to make room. � When He sat, she tried to act as normal as possible.
�
"So how was business today? � Get any new clients?"
�
Sitting back onto the couch, Master could feel something hard behind the pillow. � What on earth He thought to himself, as He reached behind to pull out the discomforting object.
�"Please don't" she cried as she tried to reach back and grab it herself. � "Please don't look", she said with almost tears in her eyes.� She knew as soon as He found the book, she was done for.
�
"What is going on?, He asked a bit sternly, slapping away her hand as she tried to grab the object. � He pulled the book out and couldn't believe His eyes.� She had been in here reading, in the dark no less, and then lied to him about it. 
�
"Claire, would you like to explain yourself?", He said, the rage barely controlled in her voice. 
�
"No, not really", she replied

"CLAIRE ELIZABETH RANDAL, you will explain what is going on this instant" 
�
"Well you see, um, I bought this book today, and you know how she is my favorite author, and well um, um, I brought it home and started reading it, before I realized I wasn't wearing my glasses. � As soon as I realized I was going to go get them, but that is when you walked in.
�"Really?" He said, "So how long were you reading before I got home?" 
�
"Not long at all, I promise." � Now that Claire was in a hole, she was firmly trying to dig herself out of it, and not thinking too clearly.
�
"Hmm, so if you just started reading it, why does the book mark show you on page 359?" 
�
"Ummmm" Claire muttered shrugging her shoulders. 
�
"Now the truth- you have been reading this book most of the afternoon, haven't you?", Master said staring intently into Claire's eyes. 
�
Unable to lie or look away, Claire quietly nodded. 
�
"And where are your glasses? � I bet in the bedroom where you left them last night."
�
Again Claire nodded.�
"Is there any good reason you didn't get up to get them at some point during the day?" 
�
"No Sir"
�
"And to make it worse, you tried to lie to me about it" 
�
"Yes, Sir"
�
"And I will bet that you lied about dinner as well- the truth is you just forgot about it" 
�
"Well not completely, I did think earlier that it would be nice to have Indian tonight" Claire said with a glimmer of hope.
�
"Claire?" Again with the stern penetrating look that was impossible to lie to. 
�
"But I did forget to order it."�
"You know you are in serious trouble young lady!" 
�
"Yes, Sir" Claire said sheepishly
�
"I want you to stand up and remove your panties, but leave your skirt on." 
�
Claire was shaking a bit as she stood, she was so sorry now that she hadn't got her glasses earlier, it would have been so easy to do. � Now she had lied, and He was so angry with her.�� With her panties off, she looked up at Him and saw him gesture for her to bend over his lap. � He knew how much she hated over the knee spankings, as they were so embarrassing and made her feel like a little kid.
As soon as she was in position, she could feel His large hand lift up her skirt and begin to rub over her round bottom. � It had been a while since her last spanking, so she knew it would hurt.� Waiting for the first strike to arrive was always the hardest part and she laid there trying to be patient. 
�
"I am really sorry.� I promise to wear my glasses for now on, just please don't spank me.""Yes, you will be sorry soon", was his only reply as He brought His hand down firmly on her � exposed bottom.� 
�
Ten rapid, stinging slaps on each cheek, slap, slap, slap. � He stopped for a minute to rub her bottom, and Claire was hopeful that He had finished when he raised His hand up high again, and brought it down again and again on her ass, turning it from a pale shade of pink to a more and more glowing red.&nbsp; Slap after slap rained down on her bottom as Claire struggled to get free.� The spanks were really starting to hurt and He wasn't letting up, wasn't letting her catch her breath and prepare for them. �� Smack, smack, smack, smack.� Claire lost count after 50 and started to beg Him to let her up.
�
"Please Sir", she said with tears in her voice, "I am really sorry. � Please stop"
�
Master just ignored her pleas and continued to punish her sorry bottom. 
�
After about five minutes, He stopped. � Claire gasped in the air as the tears gently rolled down her face.� He helped her up and as Claire rubbed her bottom lightly, she looked at Him and said how sorry she was to have disobeyed, and that she had really learned her lesson. �
"Oh, but my dear, your punishment isn't through yet. � That was just a warm up.� You are going to be spanked thoroughly for each of your infractions. One- not wearing your glasses when you are suppose to. � Two- trying to hide the fact from me and Three- lying to me.� Now young lady, I want you to march upstairs right now and grab the hair brush and then meet me downstairs in the study. � You are in for one seriously hard spanking."
�
Claire was trembling as she walked upstairs to get the hairbrush. � Of all the instruments He ever used on her, this was the one she hated the most.� Wood just always seemed so much more unforgiving than leather. � When they played He typically would use a strap or tawse, knowing how much she loved them.� The hairbrush was reserved for more serious play times or when she had been bad. � Rubbing her hand on her right cheek again, she thought how much she wasn't looking forward to what was to come.� Grabbing the large, round, flat hairbrush, she returned downstairs to His study. � He had pulled His chair out to the middle of the room.� On the desk were the strap, His favorite cane and a kitchen timer.
�
As soon as He saw her, He reached His hand out for the brush and told her to get undressed quickly. � �
Once undressed, He informed her, "For your first punishment for reading without your glasses on, you are going to get five minutes hard with the hairbrush, on your bottom and thighs, over My lap. � Any attempts to escape your punishment, and I will reset the clock for another five minutes. Do you understand?"
�
Claire couldn't believe what she was hearing, He had never spanked her that hard with the brush before. � She didn't think she would be able to sit still for 5 minutes while that evil implement rained down on her tender cheeks.� Trembling, she walked towards Him after He sat down. � When she got in front of Him, she couldn't make herself bend over.� She was too scared of what was about to happen. � He looked at her sternly and told her if she didn't bend over His lap right then, He was going to increase the time.� One minute for every time He demanded. � Claire knew He meant it, and slowly bent herself so that her hands touched the ground.� He told her to give Him her right arm, and she started to cry as she did. � Setting the timer, He brought the brush softly down on her ass.
�
The first few smacks of the brush weren't too bad, light to moderate in intensity, so she started to relax a little. � At that point, He raised His arm high in the air and started really smacking her bottom, paying no attention to where the brush landed.� Smack, smack, smack, smack, smack, the brush beat down on her poor flesh, in moderate to severe spanks. Smack, smack, smack, smack, smack. � The sound seemed to echo though the house.� Within seconds Claire was really crying.� She had no idea how long she had been there, or how much longer it was going to last. � For Claire, not knowing how much time she had left was the hardest part.� When she knew how many to expect, she could mentally prepare herself, but there was no way to see the timer, no matter how hard she tried. � Besides, there was nothing more she could concentrate on than the stinging pain being created on her backside.� Claire had no idea at what point her cries became screams of pain, and the paddle continued its assault on her bottom; smack, smack, smack. � Claire knew better than to try to get away, but that didn't stop her from kicking her feet.� It was almost an automatic reaction to the pain she was experiencing. � On and on the paddling went, until Claire was sure there was nothing left of her bottom but a bloody bruised mess.� After an eternity, the timer when off and Claire sobbed in relief. � As He rubbed His hand gingerly over her bottom, Claire cried in pain.� Certainly she had had enough.� He couldn't mean to still use the strap and cane on her.� 

Helping her off His lap, Master lead Claire to the corner. � 
�
"You are going to stand here, with your hands behind your back for the next 10 minutes, thinking about what a bad girl you have been. � There was no reason for you to be spanked tonight.� It would have been very easy to go upstairs and retrieve your glasses. � If I come in and catch you rubbing your bottom, then you will get a repeat performance with the hairbrush.� Do you understand?"
�
"Yes, Sir"
�
"When I come back in, I want a sincere apology from you for being bad", He said leaving the room. 
�
Claire stood in the corner, still crying, the tears falling down her face onto her breasts. � She was so sorry she hadn't done as He asked.� He was really just trying to look out for her, and she was suppose to wear the glasses. � There was no reason except being lazy and stubborn that kept her from wearing them, and these certainly weren't good enough reasons.
�
When He returned 10 minutes later, Claire told him how sorry she was. � It was wrong of her not to wear the glasses; silly even, and He was right to punish her for it.� She told him she had learned her lesson and hoped He would consider the punishment complete. 
�
"Claire, you have been punished and are forgiven for not wearing your glasses, but we still need to address the fact that you tried to hide the truth from me and manipulate me. � That just isn't acceptable and you need to be taught a lesson.� For that, I am going to strap you."
�
"But I have learned my lesson, and I promise not to do it again." Claire said pleadingly; "Please don't strap me. � I am already so sore, I don't think I can take it."
�
"Well you should have thought about that early this evening. � If you had just told me the truth abut the book, you would have only gotten one punishment, but you didn't trust me, nor did you respect me, when you tried to cover up your actions. � This behavior will not be tolerated.� Now no more conversation, I want you bent over the desk, now!"
�
Claire walked over to the desk and bent over. � Oh how in the world did she get herself into this she wondered?� A hard strap on her already tender bottom was going to be unbearable. 
�
Once over the desk, she could feel His hand on the lower part of her back, balancing Himself as He prepared. � 

"For your lying and disrespect, I am going to strap you firmly 60 times, and you are going to count each one out. � If you lose count, we will start from the beginning.� Do you understand?"�
"Yes Sir", she said a bit terrified. � On normal occasions, 60 thrashing with the strap without stop were enough to leave her breathless and ready to curl up in a ball.� In addition to the spanks she already received, she had no idea how she would be able to survive. 
�
Before she had a chance to think any more about it, the first slap landed severely on her right cheek. �� She screamed from the pain.� It was an explosion of pain, radiating up and down her legs.

"One Sir", she cried

The second one landed directly on her left butt cheek, with the edges of the strap sneaking into the crease between her cheeks. 

"Two Sir"

Slaps three through ten were delivered in quick succession over the middle of her bottom. � The color from a deep crimson red with some light purple marks, to a darker shade of purple as the bruises sunk in deeper.

After thoroughly�marking her bottom, Master concentrated the next five slaps right on her most sensitive spot, where her legs joined her derriere.� Slap, slap, slap, slap, slap. � Claire screamed in pain and without meaning to stood up on the fifteenth slap.
He pushed her gently back down; the tears were flowing steadily from Claire, as her Master continued to strap her bottom and legs strictly. 

For the last five, He administered the strap as hard as He could. � Claire's legs were shaking my the end and gave out on her after she received her 60th strap.� 

Pulling herself back, Claire clasped the desk, and bawled. � No longer was she thinking about anything but the pain burning down her backside.� Never had she been spanked so severely, and the knowledge that it wasn't over left her shaky. In fact, she couldn't seem to stop trembling. � She was so wobbly, she could barely stand.� Turning to face Him, she was no longer able to speak, but hoped He could look at her and know how sorry she was for being so bad. � She never meant to try to deceive Him.� He was so good to her, taking care of her after she was laid off from her job, giving her all the time to decide what she wanted to do next, providing all the emotional and finance support she could ask for. � All He asked for was that she respect and obey Him.� It shouldn't be that difficult, but she had never responded to authority well.

Sensing she was about to fall down, He offered her his arm in support. � 

"You are taking your punishment like such a good girl, and I promise it is almost over. � I will give you a minute to catch your breath and then it will be time for your last punishment- the cane.� As you have been so good, I will only give you 6 strokes, instead of the 12 I was planning. � Then you will be all done."
"Please", she begged. "Please, no more" � "I am truly sorry about tonight.� It was horribly wrong of me.� I should have never treated you like that. � I am sorry."
"I know you are, but if I let you off the hook this time, you aren't going to learn your lesson, and instead will learn that you can get out of punishment with tears and promises of good behavior. � I won't accept that. When you are bad, you will be punished.� I imagine your inability to sit for the next week will be a valuable lesson for you. � Now over to the chair."
�
Claire walked over to the chair and waited. � She tried to wipe away her tears with her hand.� Seeing this, He grabbed a Kleenex allowing her to wipe her eyes and blow her nose.� 
�
"Hands on the arm rests, legs spread wide, and bend over as far as you can." 
�
At His words, she was reminded of how much she hated the cane, probably more so than the brush. � The sound it made as He swooshed it through the air left her shivering and goose bumps running up and down her body.�� Several times He swung it close to her, and several times she tensed up. � He keep this up until she finally relaxed her bottom, and then brought the cane smartly down across the seat of her bottom.� Claire jumped up screaming. � It felt as if 1000 bees had all stung her at the same time.� The pain wouldn't stop, and was so centralized, she thought she would faint. 
�
"Back into place unless you want me to add those six back." 
�
Quickly Claire bent down again, and again He played with the cane until she began to relax again. � This time He brought it down swiftly twice one right after another, causing Claire to kick her legs involuntarily, while screaming.
�
Gasping for breath and feeling the burning, stinging, throbbing of her bottom, Claire tried to get her emotions under control. � Only three more, she could handle three more, she thought as number four hit her across her legs.� It took all of Claire's efforts not to jump up and run out of the room. � The cane against her legs was miles worse than the ones higher up.� The tears started flowing again down her face. � She was unable to stop them and tried to concentrate on the pain as she was stuck a fifth time.
�
The sixth and last stroke of the cane was delivered again across the seat of her pants, and hurt like hell, but Claire was just relieved that her spanking was over. � She stayed there, bent over the chair, crying and crying.� When He turned her around and took her in His arms like a rag doll, she cried quietly onto His shoulder, whispering over and over again "I am sorry". � 
�
"Shhhh", He said, "It is all over now. � You are forgiven."
�
Taking her gently, He sat down in the chair, with Claire curled up in His lap. � When her crying had started to cease, He wiped her face with a tissue and had her blow her nose.� 

He rocked her back and forth, whispering in her ear what a good girl she had been and how proud of her He was, and how it was all over now. 
As Claire settled down, she noticed that pushing against her sore and painful bottom was His hard cock. � She had been so caught up in her pain, that she had failed to notice how turned on He was.� Seeing the realization in her eyes, He told her to lean back and close her eyes. � He slowly started running his hands over her breasts; she was amazed how hard they were, and how much they wanted to be pinched and squeezed.� When He finally complied, she moaned in pleasure.� Her body was very turned on by her spanking.� As His mouth reached for her nipples and slowly pulled on them with his tongue and lips, His hands spread her legs wide open for Him. � She laid in front of Him, completely exposed.� A toy to play with as He saw fit.� Running the base of His hand over her mound, He couldn't believe how wet she was. � There was enough of her juices there to completely over His large hand.
�
"What a little pain slut you are." He said as His hand continued to manipulate her pussy. � Sticking two of His fingers deep inside her, fucking her with them, while his thumb rubbed up and down over her throbbing, swollen clit.

The only response He got was her moans growing louder by the minute. 

He returned His mouth to her nipples, now biting them harder, rubbing them back and forth threw His teeth, pulling harshly. � With His mouth assaulting Claire's nipples, His fingers continued fucking Claire.� Deeper and deeper into her burning hot, moist flesh his fingers went. � All the while, this thumb continued to circle her engorged clit.� He had never seen her so big before.� He could feel her body beginning to tremble as the orgasm started deep within her.� She begged Him to slow down, but He kept up His pace, getting faster and faster, pulling on her nipple, biting harder and harder until she was crying out in pain and pleasure.� When her orgasm finally reached the surface, her body blushed a bright pink as she shook and shook beneath him.� The orgasm wouldn't stop. � She thought she could take no more, but it kept building and building, each crash more violent than the one before.� She wasn't sure how much more she could handle when she felt Him lift her up and bend her over the table. � Quickly He took out his hard cock and slammed it into her still spasming pussy.�� The smoldering hot walls of her pussy combined with the juices coating His cock were almost to much for Him as He pounded into her, oblivious that He was smacking His pelvic bone against her spanked bottom over and over again. �� Caught in the fantasy of how turned on He got spanking her over and over again, listening to her beg and cry, and the look on her face as she came again and again in His arms, He reached around when His one hand and pinched firmly her still inflamed clit. 

Bending over the table, Claire was in painslut heaven, caught in subspace as the pain in her bottom was being smacked into by His hard body and His huge cock was ripping in and out of her starving pussy. � When He reached around and started pinching her clit fiercely, she could feel the body breaking orgasm that had just eluded her.� Closer and closer it came, ripping through her body, to the point that she was afraid that went it arrived it would consume her. � She would be nothing else but her exploding clit.� She could feel Him increasing His speed and intensity, fucking her as hard as He could. � Pinching and pulling on her clit.� As the orgasm finally broke the surface and let off an explosion in her mind.� Her body felt so raw, so exposed, as if her clit would always be this sensitive. � On and on it went; she desperately wanted it to stop, but He just kept fucking her, milking it out of her.� Pinning her to the table, not letting her move and the orgasm convulsed though her body. � It was only as she was coming down, that she realized He had orgasmed as well and was leaning gently against her also struggling for breath. 

After a few moments of holding onto each other, they slowly unpeeled themselves, quickly showered and changed and went out for their Indian meal; they were famished.
