Synopsis: A sister takes vengeance on the cruel men who hurt her twin.           






The Twin
Sunlight barely filtered through the dirty window.&nbsp; The few weak rays awakened Arabella Warren.&nbsp; She had not slept very well because of the loud arguing heard through the thin walls of the run-down apartment she shared with her twin sister, Alexis, and their mother.&nbsp; Her sister slept peacefully and she hated to wake her up.&nbsp; However, it was time to go to school.&nbsp; Momma was snoring on the other side of the small room.&nbsp; She had been working till the wee hours of the morning and finally come home.&nbsp; Arabella got her sister up and she helped her wash-up and get ready.&nbsp; The girls were breathtaking in their beauty.&nbsp; Pale skin was kissed with a touch of rose.&nbsp; Long black curls cascaded down their backs.&nbsp; Their most arresting feature was their violet eyes and long black lashes.&nbsp; Generous smiles with pearly white teeth greeted anyone who approached them.&nbsp; Even at age ten, their bodies held the hint of sensuality to come.&nbsp; 
Theirs was not a happy childhood.&nbsp; Alice Warren was a once-beautiful woman who had relied on too many lies and terrible men.&nbsp; She was a prostitute and not a very well paid one at that.&nbsp; She moved constantly and shared her bed with any man that would have her.&nbsp; She did try in a feeble way to make a good life for her girls.&nbsp; When there was a little extra money, she took them to matinee movies and showed them her favorite actress, Elizabeth Taylor.&nbsp; She always told them that they could be famous too because they looked just like her.&nbsp; The twins adored Alice with a childhood devotion that is not easily brushed aside.&nbsp; School was another matter.&nbsp; The girls were constantly reminded of their poverty and social standing.&nbsp; It was no secret that many of their mother&#8217;s frequent customers were the very dads and teachers of the children Arabella and Alexis went to school with.&nbsp; The twins did not have any friends because the good women of those paying customers did not want their little girls to associate with that whore&#8217;s whelps.&nbsp; The girls were each others&#8217; best friend.&nbsp; This life continued until the twins turned twelve.
Everett Simmons was one of the wealthiest and most powerful men in the town.&nbsp; He was also getting tired of his current whore.&nbsp; Even his wife was starting to look better than her and that was not promising.&nbsp; She whined constantly and the sex was just not worth it anymore.&nbsp; She actually dared to tell him that he could not have a taste of those two ripe fruit that lived with her.&nbsp; Well, that just wasn&#8217;t how things worked in Everett&#8217;s life.&nbsp; He always got what he wanted and no cheap prostitute was going to tell him what to do.&nbsp; After beating Alice within an inch of her life, he went to go enjoy the twins.&nbsp; With a strength belaying her injuries, Alice managed to call the police.&nbsp; Everett was thwarted that day, but he did not forget the humiliation and cost of the episode and he vowed revenge.&nbsp; Everett used the one thing that he had in abundance, wealth.&nbsp; With a few well-placed calls and greased palms, Alice Warren was deemed an unfit mother by the state and her girls were placed in foster care.&nbsp; Before Alice died of her injuries in the hospital, Everett personally visited and told her what had happened.&nbsp; She left this world screaming for her little angels.&nbsp; Everett just smiled.&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Within a few weeks time, the twins were placed into two different homes.&nbsp; Arabella was placed with a loving middle-class family that tried to be there for a scared twelve year old.&nbsp; Alexis was placed with Everett and Madeline Simmons, who had no children of their own.&nbsp; Alexis&#8217;s life in hell started immediately.&nbsp; Everett raped and abused her constantly while Madeline ignored her.&nbsp; He made sure she knew exactly why he was doing this to her.&nbsp; He said it was punishment for her mother&#8217;s disobedience and if she didn&#8217;t please him, he would hurt Arabella.&nbsp; Alexis tried to understand and please her sick stepfather.&nbsp; Arabella learned about this cruel life through the constant letters that Alexis managed to sneak out to her.&nbsp; The final straw came on the eve of the twins&#8217; fourteenth birthday.
Everett invited his two best friends over to his mansion for a night of drinking and fun.&nbsp; Carlton Van Ayers and Richard Johnston were also wealthy and influential.&nbsp; They also shared Everett&#8217;s proclivities for the debauched.&nbsp; Everett decided it was time to enjoy Alexis as a group.&nbsp; Arabella had planned to run away and take Alexis from her awful life and be free together.&nbsp; She loved her foster family, but her first responsibility was to her sister.&nbsp; By this time, the years had been kind to the twins.&nbsp; Their bodies matured into lovely beauties, but their minds took two different paths.&nbsp; Alexis had turned into a weak woman who tried to please the parents who provided a luxurious existence for the public&#8217;s view, but cruelty and hate behind mansion walls.&nbsp; Arabella became jaded in a mask of civility.&nbsp; 
Arabella had a few things packed into one bag and the address of the Simmons mansion.&nbsp; With a hasty note written to the only other people she still cared about in the world, she ran towards her sister and freedom.&nbsp; She got to the mansion grounds and found the gate with the loose latch her sister mentioned.&nbsp; She really did not have a solid plan, but she was determined.&nbsp; The sight that greeted her haunted her the rest of her life.&nbsp; She had heard laughter and screaming coming from the guest house off of the side of the main house.&nbsp; Through the glassed-in sun room, she observed her sister being whipped by three young men.&nbsp; Her back was a mass of welts.&nbsp; Alexis kept screaming, �Why, Daddy, why?�&nbsp; Everett stopped whipping long enough to snarl, �Bitch, I&#8217;m not your daddy.&nbsp; You&#8217;re nothing but a little slut!&nbsp; I don&#8217;t know who that bastard was!�&nbsp; Carlton and Richard snickered at his joke.&nbsp; Arabella was horrified into silence as Alexis was forced to suck Richard&#8217;s penis while Carlton anally raped her.&nbsp; �Do it a few more times, I&#8217;m about to cum!�&nbsp; Richard encouraged.&nbsp; With a few more jolts, he orgasmed into her mouth and face.&nbsp; Everett tied a dog collar on his foster daughter neck and dragged her from man to man as they raped and tortured her.&nbsp; Not realizing that he was suffocating her, he pulled her leash tighter and tighter.&nbsp; Before Arabella&#8217;s eyes, Alexis choked to death.&nbsp; The three friends were too drunk to notice the dead girl in front of them.&nbsp; However when they did, their reactions were dismissive and aloof.&nbsp; �Oh fuck, she&#8217;s dead.� Carlton replied nonchalantly while Richard ran his fingers carelessly through his hair.&nbsp; Everett quipped, �Do you want me to call the concierge service or should we clean this up ourselves?�&nbsp; His friends laughed while Richard said, �Let the service take care of the body.&nbsp; We certainly pay enough for it!�&nbsp; Everett started dialing and he was interrupted by a door crashing open.&nbsp; A blur of black curls started pummeling Richard, staining his designer shirt with her tears.&nbsp; Arabella screamed her anguish.&nbsp; �What the hell?� Richard said astounded.&nbsp; Carlton grabbed her by the shoulder and turned her to meet his oncoming fist.&nbsp; With a mewling cry, she descended into darkness.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Arabella awakened to blinding light.&nbsp; She heard that dreaded voice.&nbsp; �The bitch is finally awake.&nbsp; Good.� �Oh, don&#8217;t bother getting up.&nbsp; The restraints are too strong.�&nbsp; Arabella turned her head towards Everett.&nbsp; He was seated calmly, smoking a cigarette.&nbsp; �I just wanted to let you know that you are a whore like your mother.&nbsp; See, your mother did not understand her place.&nbsp; I am a man of power and I get what I want, especially from whores like her and your sister.&nbsp; I did this to teach her a lesson and other whores like you a lesson.&nbsp; Now that the lesson is over, I am done with your family and I am done with you.&nbsp; Good day.�&nbsp; Arabella screamed one last question, �Where is my sister?!�&nbsp; Everett answered as he walked out of the room, �I do not know and I do not care.&nbsp; She&#8217;s in the garbage with the rest of the trash.�&nbsp; Her screams echoed in the padded room.&nbsp; 
Arabella was in a white room hell when she finally realized where she was.&nbsp; She was in the state mental hospital.&nbsp; Her every action was controlled by cruel orderlies.&nbsp; One orderly was crueler than the rest.&nbsp; He was Buck, the head orderly of the psych ward at the state mental hospital.&nbsp; He took a special interest in his latest charge.&nbsp; She was beautiful and helpless.&nbsp; Buck raped her at his leisure.&nbsp; At first she resisted, but then survival took priority.&nbsp; She learned to accept his assault, but dared to ask him why.&nbsp; His answer surprised her.&nbsp; �You are so hot and sexy.&nbsp; I would do anything for you if you were mine on the outside.�&nbsp; Arabella&#8217;s jaded mind clicked.&nbsp; She could use the very man that continually hurt her.&nbsp; She decided to test this new-found power.&nbsp; She asked Buck for a few small favors, like more access to the computer lounge, better food, and unsupervised walks.&nbsp; Buck quickly complied as she willingly gave him access with her body.&nbsp; She never again let her emotions get involved; they had died with Alexis that night.&nbsp; Slowly, she began to plan her escape and revenge on the men that destroyed her family.&nbsp; 
Four years passed quickly and she was now eighteen.&nbsp; Arabella had escaped the mental hospital with the assistance of Buck.&nbsp; He was stupid enough to think Arabella was in love with him and be his on the outside.&nbsp; Trusting her, he went out one day, leaving her alone at the residence he shared with her.&nbsp; This was the chance she needed.&nbsp; His money, car keys, and her memories were all she took when she left.&nbsp; He was only a tool that she used and discarded.&nbsp;&nbsp; He was soon forgotten in the pursuit of her revenge.&nbsp; Arabella knew that her greatest asset was her gorgeous body.&nbsp; After a few stints of local modeling, Arabella caught the eye of a talent agent who had a few good connections in the international entertainment business.&nbsp; She began a small modeling career in Europe.&nbsp; No one knew her background and she paid special care not to let anyone, especially a man, get too close to her.&nbsp; Hers was a lonely existence, but she was willing to pay the price to avenge her sister.&nbsp; 
Henri Francois Belangere, Duc (Duke) de Lavoie stood outside his penthouse sipping a brandy.&nbsp; One of his valets had just laid out his tuxedo for the party he was forced to attend by friendship.&nbsp; Donnie Martins was an old friend he made a point of visiting whenever he was in Milan on business or pleasure.&nbsp; Even though Henri and Donnie came from two different wealthy backgrounds, they became good friends while they attended the same exclusive boarding school for young men.&nbsp; Henri turned when his butler came with the phone.&nbsp; �Harry, where are you?!&nbsp; The party is about to start.� Donnie yelled into Henri&#8217;s ear.&nbsp; �My dear fellow, you know I only arrive on French time.&nbsp; I will be there when I get there.�Henri said calmly as he handed his empty glass to the waiting valet.&nbsp; �But Harry, you will miss my surprise�ahh, just get here.�&nbsp; Donnie exclaimed in his brash American accent and hung up.&nbsp; Henri chuckled and handed the phone back to the butler.&nbsp; He sighed and got ready.
Belangere was the current Duc (Duke) de Lavoie, ancient French nobility with close familial ties to the other European royal houses.&nbsp; He was also one of the wealthiest men in the world.&nbsp; At 35 years old with handsome patrician features, he was one of the most eligible bachelors in the jet-set crowd.&nbsp; He thoroughly enjoyed his wealth and privilege as an unredeemed playboy bachelor.&nbsp; He would not settle down with one woman for a few years to come.&nbsp; Or so he thought.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Arabella Warren walked through the garish party crowd with a mysterious air.&nbsp; Known exclusively as Bella Donna (beautiful lady), she was a must-have guest as any hot party.&nbsp; Her renowned beauty and grace led to many admirers and many who wanted to be more.&nbsp; She did not allow any to go farther and this added to her intrigue.&nbsp; She was a lovely model to work with, but she stayed away from the party life.&nbsp; Donnie Martins had called in many favors to secure her place at his party tonight.&nbsp; He had a bet going with Henri that he could find him the perfect woman to become his Duchess.&nbsp; On the line was a $50,000 pot that Donnie could ill-afford to lose and Henri could care less about.&nbsp; He knew that he could win if he could just get Henri and Bella together for one night.&nbsp; He was counting on a miracle.&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Henri stepped out of his Rolls Royce and winced when Donnie bellowed a greeting.&nbsp; �Harry, you&#8217;re finally here.&nbsp; Good to see you, man!�&nbsp; After being caught in a rough bear hug, Henri replied with a more civilized air.&nbsp; Donnie was not one to stand on formality and Henri was pleased at the freedom.&nbsp; While his chauffeur received final instructions and rode off, Henri was in the clutches of his good friend.&nbsp; The other party guests was awed by the presence of the well-known nobleman and showed proper obeisance, one did not.&nbsp; The vision before him stared him straight in the eye.&nbsp; She was draped in a violet gown that flattered her sensuous body.&nbsp; Her vivid violet eyes held enigmas he wished to explore.&nbsp; The duke was instantly entranced.&nbsp; Donnie inwardly cheered as he spoke up.&nbsp; �Your Grace, may I present Bella Donna��&nbsp; Henri was captivated by her alluring scent as he bowed over her outstretched hand.&nbsp; �My Lord��Arabella murmured with dignity.&nbsp; Donnie started planning how to spend his winnings.&nbsp; 
Henri and Arabella enjoyed a whirlwind courtship.&nbsp; He had never met a woman that was so confident within herself and not awed by his wealth and position.&nbsp; She was gracious and lovely in her looks and demeanor, but with an aloofness that he found fascinating.&nbsp; Henri began to bare himself to Arabella and she accepted his openness.&nbsp; She, however, still kept her reserve.&nbsp; Henri pursued her with a rare passion and fell deeply in love with her.&nbsp; He took the final step and proposed marriage.&nbsp; Arabella declared the only way she would marry him was for him to never inquire about her background and to sign all rights and privileges of his wealth and power over to her with no pre-nup.&nbsp; Foolishly he obeyed.&nbsp; They were married in a lavish wedding and Henri now felt complete.&nbsp; He had his perfect Duchess and he would spend the rest of his life with his Bella Donna.&nbsp; 
Arabella&#8217;s revenge plan was going perfectly.&nbsp; She had waited seven years and perfected each move.&nbsp; When her agent had suggested the move to Europe to further her modeling career, she jumped at the opportunity.&nbsp; Here she enjoyed the anonymity she craved and moved in the social circles that she needed to be in to secure the wealth to finance her plan.&nbsp; Meeting the flamboyant Donnie Martins at a photo shoot for the product he was financing and she was modeling was pure luck.&nbsp; He pursued her romantically with the same ferocity he lived his life, but she graciously declined.&nbsp; However, she wisely cultivated a friendship that opened business and personal opportunities otherwise declined to her.&nbsp; Donnie was not wealthy enough for her, but his friend, the Duc de Lavoie, certainly was more to her liking and needs.&nbsp; Through careful observation and discreet inquires, she learned what kind of woman Henri did and did not like.&nbsp; The one thing Arabella definitely learned in her twenty-five years of life is that money and privilege make the world go round.&nbsp; The best ways for a woman to secure that life were looks and marriage.&nbsp; She had seen too many of her fellow models used as eye candy on the arm of some wealthy playboy then discarded when no longer needed.&nbsp; Her own mother was destroyed in this by the wealthy man she hated most in this world, Everett Simmons.&nbsp; When Donnie jokingly told her of his on-going bet with �Harry� and how she would be the perfect wife for him, Arabella nonchalantly encouraged him.&nbsp; She set the plan in motion and enjoyed what it produced:&nbsp; a marriage to one of the wealthiest men in the world and power to use at her whim in punishment and pleasure.&nbsp; She had denied herself too long and it was time to be reborn as Arabella Warren- Belangere, the Duchess of Lavoie.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Living in the world of modeling, wealth, and privilege of Europe, Arabella was no stranger to sexual deviance and exhibition.&nbsp; She explored a few kinks and found her calling in the world of domination and submission.&nbsp; She now understood what was done to Alexis by those cruel men, and she decided to never be the prey but always the hunter.&nbsp; The darkest domination cruelties fascinated her cynical, revenge-filled mind.&nbsp; She found her sexual release in inflicting cruelties on willing subjects in various European sadomasochistic dungeons.&nbsp; Her marriage only increased her appetite and she now had a convenient partner.&nbsp; 
Henri was totally in love with his gorgeous wife.&nbsp; Arabella, knowing his love and not returning it, was going to enjoy using him for her purposes.&nbsp; After a year of wedded bliss, Arabella declared coldly, �I am done with this marriage.&nbsp; I want my freedom and a divorce.�&nbsp; Henri was shocked and dismayed, �Beloved, what have I done?&nbsp; Please do not leave me!&nbsp; I will do anything!�&nbsp; Arabella, pleased with his response, said, �The only way for me to stay is for you to prove your love to me.�&nbsp; Henri begged, �How do I do this?&nbsp; Beloved, I will do anything for you.�&nbsp; Arabella just smiled.&nbsp; Henri would learn to regret his words soon enough.&nbsp; With an exuberance that surprised Henri, Arabella told him that she wanted him to serve her as her slave.&nbsp; They had previously dabbled in dominance and submission, and Henri found it quite fascinating, but not his �thing�.&nbsp; He was a duke and used to getting his way.&nbsp; Not anymore it seemed.&nbsp;&nbsp; Now to save his marriage, he became the unlikely sexual and full-time slave of his new wife.&nbsp; Unfortunately, he did not know the extent of what Arabella was asking of him.&nbsp; It was too late.&nbsp; With, legal documents drawn up to show her complete ownership of him, his estate, and his future, Arabella became one of the most powerful woman in the world and it was time to show the world who she really was.&nbsp; 
After outfitting Henri&#8217;s ancestral castle in France to her discerning taste, Arabella and Henri moved there to live exclusively.&nbsp; To the public eye, Henri and Arabella were the perfect couple.&nbsp; In the castle, Arabella was queen and she ruled with an iron hand.&nbsp; Arabella had custom made leather thigh-boots with stiletto heels and gloves in varying colors.&nbsp; Her fetish outfits were hand tailored.&nbsp; Her whips, crops, and other discipline instruments were hand-crafted and tried out on any available servant.&nbsp; She was addressed by the servants and Henri as �Mistress� and other forms of honor.&nbsp; Henri was reduced to being called anything but his given name.&nbsp; He was also forced to be on all-fours like a dog and naked at all times in his own castle.&nbsp; His penis was kept in permanent chastity with Arabella having the only key to the lock.&nbsp; His absolute love and new-found submissive nature kept him an obedient and willing partner in the absurdity.&nbsp; Those servants that disagreed mysteriously disappeared and were replaced with more appropriate ones.&nbsp; Arabella&#8217;s life was good, and it was soon to get better.&nbsp; 
While Arabella read the latest fashion magazine, Henri was licking her boots clean from her morning excursions.&nbsp; She had been riding Henri&#8217;s prized horses and had stepped in various muck and manure.&nbsp; She addressed his bowed head, �I will have the special private party in a month and you will invite my three special guests.&nbsp; You know who.�&nbsp; �But, Arabella�� Henri began.&nbsp; He was interrupted by a boot kick to the face.&nbsp; He cried out in pain and quickly corrected his mistake, �Mistress, please forgive your foolish slave!&nbsp; Please have mercy on me!�&nbsp; Arabella coldly answered, �Henri, let me explain something to you.&nbsp; I will only tell you this one time only.&nbsp; I do not love you.&nbsp; I own you.&nbsp; You are shit.&nbsp; All men are shit.&nbsp; I can get rid of you anytime I want.&nbsp; What do you think happened to those servants who forgot their place when I first moved here?&nbsp; They disrespected me and now they are all dead.&nbsp; All those large canvas bags I had you dump in that large pit were their corpses.&nbsp; You never once questioned me about what they were, God, you are an idiot.&nbsp; I once told you the reason why I married you and what is this most important thing in my life.&nbsp; You were stupid enough not to believe me or to forget, so let me remind you.&nbsp; The only people I ever loved in this world were my sister and my mother.&nbsp; They were murdered by three men and they have to pay.&nbsp; It has been many years and they have forgotten what they did, but I never have.&nbsp; You are a tool that is here for my use, nothing more.&nbsp; I keep you around because you are a useful slave.&nbsp; When you lose that usefulness, you will join the others in that pit.&nbsp; I have no qualms about getting rid of you or anyone else who gets in my way.&nbsp; Rich men like you used to be, think that they own the world and everyone in it.&nbsp; Well, three rich men used the wrong family and they are going to pay.&nbsp; I and I alone will be their judge, jury, and executioner.&nbsp; I&#8217;m going to enjoy them the same way they enjoyed my family.�&nbsp; Henri cried at her words, but knew he would obey.&nbsp; He loved her that much.&nbsp; 
Arabella walked to a small room off the side of her suite.&nbsp; It was a shrine to her mother and sister.&nbsp; The only picture her mother took with her girls was encased behind glass.&nbsp; Alexis&#8217;s letters were individually encased on the walls.&nbsp; As she touched the heirlooms with gloved hands, a single tear fell from a violet eye.&nbsp; She whispered to no one in particular, �I do this for you.�&nbsp; She closed the door behind her and walked with purpose to her destiny.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Everett, Carlton, and Richard sat aboard the personal jet of the Duke and Duchess of Lavoie.&nbsp; They were overwhelmed by the opulence of their surroundings, but they tried to act at ease.&nbsp; A week before, they all received the invitation to attend a private party hosted by their illustrious new business partners.&nbsp; Previously, the three friends had pooled their wealth into an individual company which was growing steadily.&nbsp; Through a stroke of luck, the famously wealthy Duke contacted them with a profitable partnership that they could not pass up.&nbsp; They should have looked at the fine print a little closer, but they were blinded by the prospect of tripling their coffers.&nbsp; Arabella had manipulated various business avenues to gain control of their company and their lives.&nbsp; Even though they thought they were dealing with Henri, they were in the clutches of the cruel Duchess of Lavoie.&nbsp; 
They were greeted at the airport by a gleaming Rolls Royce bearing the Lavoie family crest.&nbsp; The chauffeur smartly bowed and escorted them to the vast Lavoie castle.&nbsp; They were ushered in the large foyer and were fawned over myriad servants.&nbsp; They were enjoying themselves too much to notice that they had not yet met their hosts.&nbsp; 
Arabella watched the proceedings from a hidden camera in the foyer.&nbsp; She was disgusted by the men&#8217;s behavior but that would soon be corrected.&nbsp; She had Henri help her dress for her final meeting with them.&nbsp; She was dressed in all black leather:&nbsp; thigh-high six-inch stiletto boots, over-elbow tight opera gloves, black bustier, and black thong.&nbsp; Her pale skin was accented by the shiny leather.&nbsp; Her violet eyes flashed with fervor and she shook her long, loose curls free.&nbsp; She was handed her black leather riding crop.&nbsp; She was ready to face them.&nbsp; Henri was allowed to look as his wife and mistress before his hood was placed on his head and his leash attached to his permanent dog collar.&nbsp; She was a beautiful vision of cruelty and pain.&nbsp; His penis engorged painfully against his spiked chastity device.&nbsp; She laughed at his discomfort and closed the zippers that covered his eyes.&nbsp; She sat on a chair and waited for her guests to be prepared for her visit.&nbsp; 
Everett, Carlton, and Richard enjoyed the choice alcohol that flowed freely from the bar of the sitting room where they were placed.&nbsp; They brazenly examined the plush furnishings around them.&nbsp; They did not know that the maid had placed a sleeping draught in their drinks and they were soon to be asleep.&nbsp; Footmen were waiting to take them to the Duchess&#8217;s private dungeon.&nbsp; The three men collapsed to the floor.&nbsp; The servants went about their given duties, not giving another thought to the prone figures soon to be punished by Her Grace.&nbsp; 
Everett woke up first to a blinding headache and a restrained state.&nbsp; He groaned and drew silent when he heard a female voice coming from the darkness.&nbsp; �The bitch is finally awake.&nbsp; Good.� �Oh, don&#8217;t bother getting up.&nbsp; The restraints are too strong.�&nbsp; He saw the glow of a cigarette and he froze.&nbsp; His mind flew back to a familiar scene from years ago.&nbsp; �You!� he gasped.&nbsp; A light clicked on and a woman he had never seen but he knew completely was seated before him.&nbsp; She casually drew a deep drag on her cigarette and blew the smoke into Everett&#8217;s direction, causing him to cough.&nbsp; The woman tapped the ash onto the tongue of a hooded man that kneeled near her boots.&nbsp; In fear, Everett urinated on himself and heard the groans of two other men.&nbsp; �Silence.� Arabella commanded.&nbsp; A burly footman smacked him in the face, drawing blood.&nbsp; Another servant announced regally, �May I present Their Graces, the Duke and Duchess of Lavoie��&nbsp; Arabella laughed heartily at the situation.&nbsp; �I remember the last time we met.&nbsp; How funny that our roles are now reversed.�&nbsp; Despite the circumstance, Everett was aroused by Arabella&#8217;s dominant presence and his penis rose.&nbsp; Being naked, it was plain to see for the assembled servants.&nbsp; With a nod, the same footman kicked him in his genitals.&nbsp; He howled in pain and jerked against his chains.&nbsp; Arabella addressed Everett again, �You disgust me, you pig!&nbsp; I hold you and your friends&#8217; worthless lives in my hands and you still disrespect me.&nbsp; You will all learn your place before this night is through.�&nbsp; She finished enjoying her long cigarette and put the butt on the tongue of the hooded man.&nbsp; He greedily swallowed the gift.&nbsp; She ordered Henri to take off his hood and pulled his leash tight.&nbsp; She crossed her boots and had Henri start licking them clean.&nbsp; �You see, a rich powerful man can learn his proper place.&nbsp; Everett, you were always so quick to teach others lessons, you need to become a student yourself.&nbsp; I am going to become your greatest teacher.&nbsp; However, I need to teach your two friends first.&nbsp; Your lesson will be last and I will enjoy it the most.�&nbsp; 
Carlton was to be her first victim.&nbsp; Arabella had her two bodyguards move her large armchair in front of him.&nbsp; She did not look at him for a full three minutes.&nbsp; These were the longest minutes of Carlton&#8217;s life.&nbsp; A deadly voice broke the silence.&nbsp; �You raped an innocent fourteen year old girl.&nbsp; She was the foster daughter of your best friend.&nbsp; Why did you do it?�&nbsp; Carlton sputtered flimsy excuses.&nbsp; In a rage, Arabella got out of her chair and smacked his face with her riding crop.&nbsp; �You have no excuses, you maggot!�&nbsp; A maid quickly brought a cool flute of water for the Duchess and curtsied away.&nbsp; Another maid brought a large tray full of various dildos and a strapping belt.&nbsp; Arabella picked up a large eighteen-inch dildo with attached nails protruding outward.&nbsp; She caressed it with a gloved hand as Carlton screamed in terror.&nbsp; With a snap of her riding crop against her boot, Henri crawled over to assist his wife put on the belt and attaches the dildo into the holder.&nbsp; Arabella nodded and two footmen took the struggling Carlton from his chained position on one of the walls and secured him into the �stocks�.&nbsp; His legs were secured by chains attached to the floor.&nbsp; A footman presented a ball gag to Arabella and she waved it away.&nbsp; He would squeal this night for her pleasure and his pain.&nbsp; With no warning, Arabella thrust the long nail-dildo into his virgin arse.&nbsp; The unimaginable pain rendered him unconscious.&nbsp; With a wave of her gloved hand, a bucket of ice cold water was thrown on him.&nbsp; Again and again this process was repeated.&nbsp; Within a few minutes, Carlton&#8217;s arse was reduced to ground meat and he collapsed against his restraints.&nbsp; Arabella&#8217;s stiletto boot heels echoed in the chamber as she surveyed her handiwork.&nbsp; She walked to his face and thrust the bloodied dildo into his mouth.&nbsp; She continuously rammed it like a piston.&nbsp; She held out her hand and a servant handed her a short spiked bullwhip.&nbsp; With each thrust, she whipped his naked flesh.&nbsp; She flayed him carelessly as she enjoyed a rich orgasm.&nbsp; Carlton&#8217;s last breath was blocked by the final thrust of the dildo.&nbsp; Arabella sighed contentedly as the dildo came out with a �pop�.&nbsp; With a snap of her gloved fingers, Henri crawled over to lick the blood and shit that had dripped from the corpse and dildo unto her boots.&nbsp; Arabella smiled.&nbsp; It was time to teach her next student.&nbsp; 
Richard jerked against his chains as Arabella walked over towards him.&nbsp; �Did it feel good to have that pretty little mouth around that small dick?�&nbsp; Arabella taunted him.&nbsp; Richard denied the memories and begged for mercy.&nbsp; Arabella chuckled as she continued.&nbsp; �It was so wet and warm�all that sucking�.hmmm!�&nbsp; Richard was sobbing at this point.&nbsp; Arabella nodded and sat down on her chair.&nbsp; Two footmen took Richard from the wall, and secured him in the same device that held Carlton&#8217;s corpse, which was flung to the side.&nbsp; One of the footman asked on cue, �Your Grace, may I be relieved of your presence for a moment?&nbsp; I must attend the facilities.�&nbsp; Arabella mockingly answered, �Well, we have a toilet right here.&nbsp; Please feel free to use it.�&nbsp; With that, Richard&#8217;s mouth was held open as every male servant used him as a urinal.&nbsp; �Doesn&#8217;t that feel so warm and wet?� Arabella asked him disdainfully.&nbsp; He sputtered his protests through a mouthful of warm piss.&nbsp; Arabella was displeased with his spillage and ordered his whipping as punishment.&nbsp; While he screamed in painful anguish, Arabella had Henri lick her clit and bring her to orgasm.&nbsp; She pressed her boots onto his restrained penis and he whimpered in pleasure and pain as the chastity device&#8217;s spikes embedded into the tender flesh.&nbsp; As an afterthought, Arabella ordered the whipping ceased.&nbsp; She addressed Richard, �Since you enjoyed having my sister suck that pathetic nub of yours, I am going to make you enjoy sucking something of mine.&nbsp; Gentlemen��&nbsp; With a dramatic wave of her riding crop, a spotlight was shone upon a horrifying sight.&nbsp; Richard almost broke his wrists trying to escape his imprisonment as he realized what he was about to experience.&nbsp; Before him stood a twelve-foot sharpened wooden pole with a staircase leading to a platform resting near it.&nbsp; The two footmen took the resisting Richard and dragged him up the stairs until he was on the platform.&nbsp; Arabella regally climbed the stairs after them.&nbsp; With a nod, Richard was placed arse-first on the sharp pole and pushed down gently.&nbsp; His screams caused everyone in the chamber to shiver, some with fear and Arabella with pleasure.&nbsp; With a final smirk, she addressed him as she put her stiletto boot on his upturned face, �You were always beneath my sister and now you will be underneath me forever.&nbsp; Goodbye, boot smear.�&nbsp; She slowly pushed her boot downward, pushing Richard further down the pole.&nbsp; His screams were muffled by her boots.&nbsp; Arabella had decided to impale him slowly for her long-term pleasure.&nbsp; He would die slowly and painfully.&nbsp; His screams would be fitting music for her final performance.&nbsp; She walked slowly down each step, matching the slow descent of Richard down the ungreased wooden pole.&nbsp; Henri licked her boot soles clean at the bottom of the staircase.&nbsp; Her final lesson was about to begin.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Servants brought a full-course meal for the Duchess to enjoy while she tortured her remaining guests.&nbsp; She had her table place right in front of Everett.&nbsp; She enjoyed steamed lobster while she spoke to him.&nbsp; �Do you know why I am eating this particular food right now?&nbsp; I want you to know what I am going to do to you.�&nbsp; She demonstrated her words by breaking the lobster in half and pulling the succulent meat from the shell.&nbsp; She ate greedily while everyone looked on.&nbsp; Henri whimpered with hunger and Arabella laughed.&nbsp; Henri would eat when she decided.&nbsp; Arabella commanded Everett to be chained to the floor while she continued her feast.&nbsp; She got up and stood in front of him.&nbsp; A roach happened to crawl out in front of Everett.&nbsp; Arabella noticed and called attention to it.&nbsp; �How appropriate that part of your lesson crawled right here.�&nbsp; She let it crawl around and when it was right in front of Everett&#8217;s face, she stepped on it and twisted her boot a few times.&nbsp; In the silence of the torture chamber, the crunch was extremely loud.&nbsp; Arabella coldly addressed Everett, �Open wide, trash can.�&nbsp; A footman kneeled and forced Everett to open his mouth.&nbsp; Arabella regally wiped the roach entrails on her boot sole onto Everett&#8217;s tongue.&nbsp; With a few lashes of the spiked bullwhip, he quickly swallowed her gift.&nbsp; Arabella ordered Henri to lick the boot smear off the floor.&nbsp; He lovingly obeyed his wife and Mistress.&nbsp; Everett was whipped again while Arabella finished her dinner.&nbsp; She stepped onto his wounded back and dug her stiletto boot heels into the lash marks.&nbsp; Everett howled in pain, but Arabella was beyond caring.&nbsp; She was fingering herself in time with her boot thrusts.&nbsp; Her orgasm was quite long, as was Everett&#8217;s back torture.&nbsp; She had a butler bring her a small caliber pistol.&nbsp; She shot Everett in non-lethal areas and then dug her boot heels into the wounds.&nbsp; It was now time to finish his lesson, but at her own pace.&nbsp; She had other, more important things to do as the Duchess of Lavoie.&nbsp; 
Everett was strung up to a wooden beam.&nbsp; With a red-hot rod, Arabella carved the names of her sister and her mother into his chest.&nbsp; His inhuman screams delighted her and horrified her audience.&nbsp; None, however, would dare interrupt Arabella, including her own husband.&nbsp; She signed her own full name &#8211; Arabella Warren- Belangere, her Serene Grace, Duchess of Lavoie.&nbsp; When she finished, there was not an inch of unflustered, undamaged skin left of his body.&nbsp; With a gasp, Everett begged for mercy.&nbsp; Arabella laughed and addressed him for the last time.&nbsp;&nbsp; �I just wanted to let you know that you are shit like your friends.&nbsp; See, you did not understand your place.&nbsp; I am a woman of power and I get what I want, especially from shit like you and your friends.&nbsp; I did this to teach you a lesson and other pieces of shit like you a lesson.&nbsp; Now that the lesson is over, I am done with your friends and I am done with you.&nbsp; Good day.�&nbsp; Arabella picked up a beautifully hand-crafted Lavoie family sword and touched it reverently with gloved hands.&nbsp; She took a masterful swing and chopped his penis off.&nbsp; With a smile forged from the depths of hell and a dark vision in black leather, Arabella plunged the sword deep in Everett&#8217;s heart.&nbsp; The final words he heard were Arabella commanding Henri to call the concierge service to clean up the mess they made because they certainly paid enough not to do it themselves.&nbsp;
