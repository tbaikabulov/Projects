 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He awoke in an unfamiliar bed.&nbsp; It was king size, far larger than the one in his house, and he was laid out atop the sheets wearing nothing but loose fitting pajama bottoms.&nbsp; He was naked underneath.&nbsp; Light shone in from behind the curtains.&nbsp; 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;What did he do the previous night?&nbsp; He couldn&#8217;t remember.&nbsp; All that came to mind were the end of the work day. He got into his car and was on his way home to his siblings when� yes, that was it.&nbsp; His car had a flat tire so he pulled off to the side of the road.&nbsp; The women that stopped to help him seemed so nice.&nbsp; But he couldn&#8217;t remember ever reaching the house he had inherited from his parents.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And here he was, stripped of his belongings and nearly naked in a well-furnished room of a splendor completely foreign to his upbringing.&nbsp; It appeared to be a large suite, like a luxury hotel room that he had only ever seen in the movies.&nbsp; The bed occupied a small room that led through a wide archway to a seating area.&nbsp; The smaller room contained two chairs and a wide sofa, each with matching red and gold upholstering.&nbsp; Everything, from the ornate wooden carvings that that trimmed the walls to the lush, patterned carpeting, all looked distinctly upper class, far distanced from the lower class up-bringing and life style that he was used to. 

Hoping to get a view of his surroundings, he went to the window and pulled open the curtain.&nbsp; It was clouded glass illuminated by a single light, but, as he focused his eyes, he realized that it was not what it tried to appear as.&nbsp; It was a single light bulb acting as an artificial sun, meant to give the suite&#8217;s residents the perception of being somewhere with a view of the sun.&nbsp; He had seen situations like this before, in the documentaries he used to watch during his siblings&#8217; sick days.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Now worried, he ran to the door.&nbsp; It did not budge.&nbsp; He scoured the walls to see if there were any way out, but it was useless&#8212;the wallpaper covered every inch of the wall without seams.&nbsp; Inspecting the door closer, he discovered a crack in the lower half, but, like the door itself, it did not budge an inch.&nbsp; 

Exhausted and demoralized, he returned to the bed and rested.&nbsp; Soon, his mind drifted, and he fell asleep with no impending tasks for the first time in years.

--
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He awoke to the sound of knocking and realized it was coming from the door.&nbsp; He answered.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Beyond the threshold stood a tall blond woman with blue eyes wearing black dress pants, a buttoned suit coat, and a puffy white blouse. Her hair was stretched back behind her head into a tight bun. Her cleavage pushed and squeezed her clothing, and Eric got the distinct impression that it was her intent.&nbsp; Behind her flanked two muscular women, both wearing brown tank tops, camouflage pants, and carrying rifles.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Good morning, Eric.&nbsp; Mind if my friends and I come in?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He looked again at the weapons.&nbsp; �Sure.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;They stood face to face in the foyer of the suite.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�How are you feeling?� she asked.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Um� fine, thank you.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Do you now why you&#8217;re here?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�How could I possibly?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She laughed.&nbsp; �Oh, of course not.&nbsp; How could you know?&nbsp; My name is Eleanor Wimble, and I am the leader of the Society for the Preservation of Humanity.� 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Society for�� echoed Eric.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Yes, the Society for the Preservation of Humanity.&nbsp; Do you know anything about biology, Eric?�

�A little.�&nbsp; 

�Well, if you need me to go more in depth with anything, feel free to stop me with a question.&nbsp; Now, let&#8217;s see if� ah yes.&nbsp; We were founded eight years ago as a means towards righting the evolutionary path of mankind.&nbsp; You see, mankind has been de-evolving for hundreds or thousands of years. With advents in medicine and slow deviation from sustenance-based lifestyle, the human race no longer selects the truly fit for procreation.&nbsp; No, instead of health, strength, and power allowing a man to pass on his seed, now anyone with smooth words, a nice car, and enough cash to pay for a drink can be a father.&nbsp; Utter travesties like that are why our Society is needed.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�And why do you need me?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Simply put, you&#8217;re here for your genes.&nbsp; Congratulations, Eric.&nbsp; You&#8217;re going to be a father.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;His heart dropped.&nbsp; A� father?&nbsp; Had they already taken his seed during the night, or�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Wha... what do you mean?&nbsp; Did you��

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�No, no, we haven&#8217;t done anything to you yet.&nbsp; But we will, we will.&nbsp; However, we hope that you&#8217;ll see the benefit to helping us.&nbsp; Though your life will be devoted to our cause, we will do everything to make your life heaven.&nbsp; Fine clothes, a free society, gourmet food for every meal&#8212;all that we ask is that you donate your seed to dozens of women, each personally selected to be a perfect genetic match.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He sat there, stunned.&nbsp; They took him so he could father children for a living?&nbsp; Who the hell were these people?

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I&#8217;m a freaking mechanic!&nbsp; Why would you abduct me, and not somebody worth a damn?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She smirked.&nbsp; �You&#8217;re worth a lot more than you think, Eric.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I can barely afford our food.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Your success does not reflect your true worth.�&nbsp; She pressed her left hand against his chest and slid it down into his pants.&nbsp; She grabbed his testicles in a firm grasp.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;His body jerked, shocked at her forwardness, but he hold his pose.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Your genes are what we&#8217;re interested in.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I never even graduated college!�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�And we know why you never graduated&#8212;it was because of your family.&nbsp; Your mother needed help taking care of your brothers and sisters after your dad passed, and you dropped everything to fill your role as the perfect big brother.&nbsp; That reflects better on you than you think.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I��

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Please don&#8217;t decide right away.&nbsp; Come with us.&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to show you what is at stake.�&nbsp; She grabbed his hand and led him gently into the hallway. 

 The corridor looked like a hotel: white walls, patterned carpeting, ornate light fixtures, and doors set along the sides spaced every thirty feet.&nbsp; They headed straight down the corridor, past an intersection.&nbsp; Dozens of rooms down the hall, it made a ninety-degree turn to the left.&nbsp; They stopped at a room labeled &#8216;2112&#8217;.&nbsp;&nbsp; The woman grabbed the handle and opened the door.

It was another suite, identical to the one Eric had woken up in.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Here is your first partner.&nbsp; Her name is Rachel.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Eric turned and stared at the raven-haired girl that kneeled on the bed.&nbsp; Her hair was red and curly, and descended down past her bare shoulders.&nbsp;&nbsp; She wore nothing but a see-through green nightgown with fluffy white-trimming.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Is this him?� asked Rachel, eyeing over Eric like a piece of meat.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Yes, he is,� answered Eleanor
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�So, go on.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Go on?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Yes, you&#8217;re here to breed, and you&#8217;ll spend the rest of your days doing it, one way or another.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I&#8217;m not going to fuck her on command.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Yes, you will, Eric.&nbsp; You don&#8217;t have a say in the matter.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I can&#8217;t do this!� he yelled as he turned around and darted for the door.&nbsp; 

One of the guards quickly stepped into his way and snapped her rifle butt into his chest, and he collapsed to the floor.

�I have to take care of my family!� he yelled, clenching his chest and gasping for air.

�The survival of the human race is more important than them.&nbsp; Besides, we&#8217;ll make sure they get everything they need.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Eric stood back up and slammed his fist into the wall.&nbsp; A painting ten feet away shook from its nail and crashed the floor.&nbsp; �No!�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Eleanor frowned.&nbsp; �Let me lay it out simply for you.&nbsp; You are here for the sake of humanity.&nbsp;&nbsp; You will contribute, and if you do it willingly, you can be a member of our society as an equal.&nbsp; However, should you continue to defy us, you will be a slave, a person whose only value in life is their ability to breed.&nbsp; Now, let me ask you this one more time.&nbsp; Will you, or will you not fuck Rachel?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He turned to the vixen.&nbsp; She returned a seductive smile as she played with her lips.&nbsp; 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I� I&#8217;m not going to do this.&nbsp; I&#8217;m not going to sacrifice my virginity and my life over a cheap and worthless whore like her.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Hey!� protested Rachel, but everybody in the room ignored her.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Fine, then.&nbsp; I&#8217;m sorry things could not work out, Eric.&nbsp; I truly am.�&nbsp; She turned around to the armed guards.&nbsp; �Take him to the workshop.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;They holstered their weapons behind their backs and once again constrained Eric.&nbsp; They soon disappeared into the hallway towards their next destination.

---

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It was a cold and cluttered workshop.&nbsp; He recognized the tools as part of smelting and welding, including a variety of blowtorches and hammers.&nbsp; A well-toned woman in a tube top sat in the corner on a stool.&nbsp; She was smoking a cigarette, her eyes intently fixed on a small portable TV on the workbench.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Mona!� yelled Eleanor.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Wha�� responded the woman.&nbsp; She sat up straight and turned her head to the door, allowing the cigarette to fall from the mouth onto the concrete floor, where it joined a pile of ash and other cigarettes.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�We have another one that needs to be collared.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Again?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Yes, again.&nbsp; I assume you have some more ready?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Yeah, I have more than enough.&nbsp; I also have a few more breeding stands ready to go, if you want any.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�No, that won&#8217;t be necessary.&nbsp; Yet.� 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Well, bring him in.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The bodyguards carried Eric into the room and tightened their grip around his upper arms, just below his shoulders.&nbsp; �Where should we put him?� asked the one to his left.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�That&#8217;s fine,� answered Mona. �It&#8217;ll win only take a minute.�&nbsp; She grabbed two pieces of metal from a pile in the corner.&nbsp; They appeared to be two halves of a ring, each with a single centered imperfection&#8212;eye bolts or latches, from the looks of it.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Eric didn&#8217;t understand the objects&#8217; purpose until Mona clapped the two pieces together from each side of his neck.&nbsp; Each half slid into tiny grooves on the other, forming a loose fit.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�What are you doing?� Eric asked.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Eleanor answered, �I warned you, Eric.&nbsp; I warned you that you would help us, willing or not.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mona lit the blow torch and tested its flame, then adjusted it to its lowest setting.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Eleanor continued, �This is your mark for defying us.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mona brought the torch closer and aimed it at the joint between the two halves.&nbsp; It heated the collar and melted the two halves together, in the process searing Eric&#8217;s flesh.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Gyaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She moved around to his other side and repeated the process.&nbsp; When it was through, Eric was collared-- permanently.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The guards dropped him to the floor, where her curled into a ball and whimpered.&nbsp; The sting of the torch and molten steel continued to burn.&nbsp; He rubbed his neck and wondered how much permanent damage had been done.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I knew your mother, you know,� said Elanor.&nbsp; �She was a fantastic woman that was always more concerned in the well-being of others than her own.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�What?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�We went to school together.&nbsp; When I came up with this idea years ago, I had invited her to be a founding member, but she declined.&nbsp; You see, though serving humanity is both our compassions, we went about them different ways.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�She&#8217;d never abduct somebody, no matter the reason.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Would she?&nbsp; If she could see what I can, what horrible fate will befall mankind unless we right our course, she might have joined me.�&nbsp; Her voice trailed off.&nbsp; �And by then� it was too late.&nbsp; That fucking drunken piece of shit killed her.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�He wasn&#8217;t a piece of shit.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�He was an alcoholic asshole that destroyed your family.&nbsp; If he hadn&#8217;t drunk that night, or had let Melissa drive��&nbsp; Tears trickled down her cheeks.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Eric looked at her and realized that she was at her most vulnerable.&nbsp; He pushed.&nbsp; �She wouldn&#8217;t want me to suffer this fate.&nbsp; Please, let me go.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She laughed.&nbsp; �She&#8217;d be so disappointed if she could see you now.&nbsp; You are in a position not just to help yourself, but help everybody&#8212;all of humanity, and you turned it down?&nbsp; You&#8217;re a fool, but your genes are still worth something, as long as we don&#8217;t instill your children with a shallow sense of right and wrong.�&nbsp; She tilted her head to one of the body guards.&nbsp; �Bring him back to his suite.&nbsp; Make sure he is well-fed.�

----

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He awoke naked and chained to his bed.&nbsp; His arms and legs were spread outwards and chained to small rings inset into the bedposts via new bondage cuffs that bound his wrists and ankles.&nbsp; There was nothing he could do but wait for his captors&#8217; next move.&nbsp; 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There was no way to know how many hours passed before Eleanor returned.&nbsp; She was accompanied by a young woman with short brown hair and fair skin.
 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Here he is, Hannah.&nbsp; Isn&#8217;t it a wonderful sight?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The girl did not say anything in response.&nbsp; All she did was fiddle with the trimming of her thigh-length dress.&nbsp; From the saw of her 32D tits to the sides, Eric could tell that she wore no bra, and he assumed no panties.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Go ahead, Hannah.&nbsp; He is all yours,� said Eleanor as she gave Hannah a slight nudge.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The short brunette stumbled forwards.&nbsp; She stared directly at Eric&#8217;s flaccid cock like a deer in the headlights.&nbsp; Minutes passed, and all she could do was stare.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�If you need time, you can have it,� announced Eleanor.&nbsp; �I&#8217;ll be watching, Hannah.�&nbsp;&nbsp; She turned around and left the apartment.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Hannah stood as she was, straight down Eric&#8217;s line of sight, between his legs and above his cock.&nbsp; She was tasked with raping him, and he would probably be her first.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Hannah?� he asked.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She said nothing.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He felt bad for her.&nbsp; She too was forced into an impossible position, just as he had been forced into hours ago.&nbsp; But he made a choice.&nbsp; Soon, too, would she.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�You don&#8217;t have to do this.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She took a step closer and crawled onto the bed.&nbsp;&nbsp; �Yes, I do.�&nbsp; She reached out and tapped his cock with her fingers, then pulled away.&nbsp; Hesitating, she reached out once again, this time grabbing the flaccid cock in her hand.&nbsp;&nbsp; She took one stroke, then two, then another, when the piece of flash began to harden.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Her reaction to his physiological response was astonishing.&nbsp; She let loose the cock and fled out of eye sight.&nbsp; Eric could here her pounding on the door, scremaing for help.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�What are you doing?� asked Eleanor.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I can&#8217;t do this.&nbsp; I&#8217;m not ready.&nbsp; I have to go back.&nbsp; I need� I need to train some more.�&nbsp; Her voice spoke with a terrified urgency that shocked Eric.&nbsp; What did he do to scare her so?

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Calm down, Eleanor!&nbsp; This is your job, and if you are don&#8217;t do it then you have no worth to us.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�No,� replied Hannah, her voice resonating with a newfound conviction.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�No!?� yelled Eleanor.&nbsp; �Do you realize what you are doing?&nbsp; You cannot defy my orders and continue to be treated as you are.&nbsp; Now, this is your last warning.&nbsp; Mate with him as one of order, or else.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I will not rape him.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Fine, Hannah.&nbsp; From this day forth, you are no longer a member of our order.&nbsp; Guards, take her back and collar her.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The muscular women hesitated before grabbing each of Hannah&#8217;s upper arms with both hands.&nbsp; A look of panic overtook Hannah.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Wha, what?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�You are to be collared, Hannah, as punishment for your transgressions.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She darted her head back to forth, from guard to leader to guard. �No, please!&nbsp; I change my mind, I&#8217;ll do anything��

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�It is too late for that.&nbsp; Your decision was final, as was mine.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Eric could only watch as Hannah was dragged from the bedroom, screaming and crying.&nbsp; A sense of dread filled his stomach; it hurt to see a fellow human being have everything she held dear pried from her in an instant. 

-----

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Less than an hour later, the door opened again.&nbsp; Hannah stumbled into Eric&#8217;s site.&nbsp; She was entirely naked, but wore a welded steel collar just like Eric.&nbsp; She held a key ring in her hand.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Are� are you okay, Hannah?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She turned to him and gently nodded.&nbsp; In profile, her body was perfect.&nbsp; Large tits, wide hips, and smooth, blemish free skin.&nbsp; She had an hourglass figure unlike any Eric had ever seen.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Are those the keys to my cuffs?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She nodded again.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Could� could you free me?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She walked over to the bedposts and unlocked the tiny key locks that held his bondage cuffs in place. 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In the distance, the door opened for a brief moment than shut again.&nbsp; They walked to the entrance together, where a dinner cart waited.&nbsp; On the top shelf was a silver platter holding two sandwiches.&nbsp; One of them was roast beef&#8212;Eric&#8217;s favorite.&nbsp; He didn&#8217;t know what the other was, but he assumed it was Hannah&#8217;s preferred choice.&nbsp; Beside the platter were two wineglasses and a bottle, a clear nudge towards procreation.&nbsp; In front was a note card with elaborate handwriting.&nbsp; He lifted it between two fingers and read it.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This will be your last meal until you start mating.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He put down the card and handed it to her.&nbsp; She read it and dropped it to the floor.

�I don&#8217;t want to get pregnant yet,� she said, averting her eyes in shame.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He didn&#8217;t know how to answer, but he did know that the Society was serious.&nbsp; They would mate or starve unless they came to an agreement.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Then he noticed the items on the bottom shelf of the cart.&nbsp; Bondage toys of every variety&#8212;stun guns, whips, handcuffs, spreader bars, gags, rope&#8212;everything a man or woman would need to subdue and rape a victim.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Would they both be willing to starve themselves to death?&nbsp; Or, would one take the initiative&#8212;for both their sakes?&nbsp; Eric had no idea what his future would hold.

-----

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Nine hours in and the hunger started to hit him.&nbsp; He asked Hannah if they could work it out, but she mumbled a rejection and returned to weeping on the bed.

------

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Twelve hours in and she still resisted.&nbsp; Eric returned to the door, to the tiny hole at the bottom, and knocked.&nbsp; Minutes later, it slid open.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Hello, Eric.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Please, Eleanor, there&#8217;s nothing I can do.&nbsp; She won&#8217;t let me near her.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She giggled.&nbsp;&nbsp; �So?&nbsp; Do you think a tiny girl like her can keep you away from her forever.&nbsp; You know what you have to do to eat again, and it isn&#8217;t her decision.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�You don&#8217;t mean��

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The woman smiled briefly and slid the panel shut.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Eric froze at the thought, but quickly dismissed it from his mind.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Some sins were worse than death.

-------

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Thirty-six hours since their last meal and Eric was going insane.&nbsp; He paced around the suite, his stomach growling and twisting in hunger.&nbsp; It was all her fault, he convinced himself; he was willing to fuck her, but her self-restraint was holding him back. She didn&#8217;t want to get pregnant, but would she starve them both to death over it?

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He asked again, his voice bellying the weight of her decision.&nbsp; The answer was still no.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Hours passed, and his lust grew in proportion to his hunger.&nbsp; From the moment they met, he thought Hannah was attractive, but now, almost a day since his last meal, he viewed her as a goddess.&nbsp; Her hourglass frame with wide hips and full tits was perfect.&nbsp; Every inch of her body was attractive, and he wanted nothing more than to ravish it.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It did not take long for him to decide just that.&nbsp; 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She was lying on the bed crying when he pounced, the stun gun and a length of chain in his hands.&nbsp; Her expression revealed that she knew what was coming even before he stuck the gun against her thigh and zapped her.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Please, don&#8217;t do this��

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Shut up, bitch!&nbsp; I&#8217;m not going to wither away and die because you want to keep your virginity.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She merely looked away, her eyes clouded with tears, and accepted her fate.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Eric pulled down his sweatpants to reveal his raging engorged cock.&nbsp; He pressed it up to the edge of her pussy and prepared himself to lose his virginity alongside hers.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;At that moment, he realized what he was about to do.&nbsp; He always considered himself the good guy, the one women could trust and talk to.&nbsp; While the act never brought fruition to his own relationships, he couldn&#8217;t bring himself to destroy that image by committing rape.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I&#8217;m sorry,� he said.&nbsp; �Sorry��&nbsp; He backed off and wandered to the living room, not even bothering to put his pants back on.&nbsp; Though starvation was a terrible way to die, it was better than tainting his soul as a sexual criminal.&nbsp; He fell asleep in the chair once again, still hungry and exhausted with no end in sight except death.

--------

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He awoke to find Hannah standing in front of him. �Come here,� she said.&nbsp; She grabbed Eric&#8217;s hand and helped him up.&nbsp; 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�What is this?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Just come over here,� she continued as she pulled on his hand and led them back towards the bed.&nbsp;&nbsp; Her voice was calm and soothing, completely unlike the fear and uncertainty that had defined her words until that moment.&nbsp; �Lie down,� she commanded.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Eric rested on the bed, belly up.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Please, forgive my ineptness.&nbsp; I&#8217;ve seen the sisters do this dozens of times, but I&#8217;ve never had a chance to practice before.�&nbsp; She grabbed his flaccid cock in one hand and his balls in the other.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Hannah?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�No, I&#8217;m going to do this my way.&nbsp; I� I can&#8217;t let you starve to death because of my resistance.&nbsp; I hate them for what they&#8217;re doing to us, but they are the ones that deserve to die for it, not you.&nbsp; So, please, just let me do my work.�&nbsp; 

She applied pressure in the perfect spots and his cock grew in response.&nbsp; It wasn&#8217;t like he needed the help, but he appreciated the effort with the hardest boner he had possessed in his life.

Hannah crawled on top of him and placed her knees to his sides.&nbsp; She grabbed the cock and led in towards her pussy and sat down harder and harder until it pierced through and broke her hymen.&nbsp; Her face contorted into a pained look of shock, but she continued lowering herself.

Eric was saddened that it had come to that.&nbsp; Though the sin was to be forced on him either way, it was his fault for her enslavement, his words that pushed her to see the error of her ways.

Or had they?&nbsp; She was as hesitant as he was, a pure spirit chosen by greater powers for the salvation of humanity.&nbsp; They were picked from millions for their genes, but Eric knew that genes weren&#8217;t everything.&nbsp; Perhaps one day their benevolence would flourish, but they were both too young to understand their new roles as anything but a living nightmare.

Hannah thrust once, and again, and again, faster each time.&nbsp; She was already becoming accustomed.&nbsp; Had she been trained in this art?&nbsp; Eric could only assume so.&nbsp; He joined in, thrusting in rhythm.&nbsp; 

Her grunts soon turned to moans of pleasure, and Eric too began to pant.&nbsp; He had never imagined he would lose his virginity before his wedding night, but it felt good&#8212;better than anything he had ever experienced.&nbsp; Everything about her, about the union between him, brought carnal pleasure:&nbsp; the smoothness and warmth of his skin, the sight of her perfect body, the slight high-pitched moans that interrupted her breaths.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He held back with all his strength, as if he had an unobtainable obligation to not get her pregnant.&nbsp; She came long before he did, but she never gave up and he soon dumped his load inside of her.&nbsp; Now full, she collapsed to the bed and rested beside him.&nbsp; Cum spilled out of her and pooled onto the sheets.&nbsp; 

He leaned over and kissed her on his cheek.&nbsp; It was awkward; neither had any sort of lust or compassion for the other that had not already been relieved, yet he felt compelled to treat her as he would a real lover.&nbsp; 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A knock came at the door, and they could hear the compartment slide open.&nbsp; He stood and food a note waiting on the floor.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Raise her hips to increase the odds.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He was disgusted by their attention to detail.&nbsp; He returned to the bed and showed it to his forced lover. 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She began to cry.&nbsp; �I can&#8217;t do this.&nbsp; I can&#8217;t do this.&nbsp; I can&#8217;t do this,� she muttered beneath her breath.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Eric paused for a moment, than placed his hand on her shoulder to console her.&nbsp; He tried his best to touch her non-sensually&#8212;a challenge in their nudity.&nbsp; Though both had lost everything when they were taken into the program, there was no doubt in his mind that Hannah lost more.&nbsp; The act of copulation would have no adverse impact on Eric, but Hannah would pay a steep price.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Still, the woman&#8217;s orders had to be followed.&nbsp; Eric grabbed one of the pillows and wedged it underneath Hannah&#8217;s rear.&nbsp; She continued to cry, but did not resist.&nbsp; They fell asleep with Eric&#8217;s right arm stretched across Hannah&#8217;s body, as if already protecting his mate with a paternal instinct.
