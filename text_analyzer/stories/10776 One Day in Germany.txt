Synopsis:  James spices up a business trip with a German student who is offering day long face sitting in a smother box. Two days later and he\'s still with her, increasingly restrained with both chains and her body and finding it impossible to leave.






One Day in Germany

Karin made the short walk from her flat to the train station and waited on the concourse as arranged. 8am was early for her to be up, but this was easy money. As a student she needed all the money she could get and easy money was her favourite kind. 

She stood at the agreed place, her feet fidgeting in her old tan boots, trying to stay warm. The cold winter air was blowing straight through her well worn blue denim jeans. Her silvery white jacket gave slightly more protection, but she still looked forward to getting back to her small flat to warm up.

James spotted her from a safe distance. Mid twenties, average height, brown hair and glasses, the description of her was accurate. As he walked closer, he observed as much as he could, ready to take the final decision of whether to go through with this. 

She had a pale, slightly long face, pleasant enough without being stunning. In a good light, maybe she bordered on attractive. Her figure was hard to tell through her heavy coat. Her legs looked nice in her well fitting jeans, curvy rather than slim, but still with the advantage of youth. Unfortunately she was standing facing him with her back against the wall and so he was unable to take a view on maybe her most important characteristic. 

He was now too close, she had spotted him. 

"Karin? Nice to meet you," he said. 

She was taken slightly by surprise as she'd been looking the other way.

"James!" She smiled. He smiled back. 

"Money arrive? All OK?" James knew she spoke little English, however he spoke even less German.

"Yes."

"Can I get you a coffee?

She was a little surprised by the offer, but also pleased with the attractive, easy smile of her friend for the day. While the money was good and the work easy, meeting strangers was always dangerous. Meeting in a public place helped and she also took other precautions. She had taken self defence classes and also carried an illegal stun gun and a knife. Messing with her could be a very bad idea. 

She&#8217;d often thought about what she would do to anyone that tried to attack her. Most ideas involved her driving into the forest and handcuffing the unconscious fool to a large tree. Karin hadn&#8217;t made up her mind as to whether she would ever release him or leave him to die. It would probably depend on her mood on the day.

However, James seemed OK, tall, attractive, with lovely eyes. He had that slightly nervous, unsure look that usually indicated a nice guy just indulging in a secret fetish.&nbsp; 

James ordered from a takeaway counter and they stood together drinking lattes, the language barrier making it hard to communicate other than through the occasional smile. Karin also looked both nervous and excited as she held the hot drink in both hands in an attempt to warm up. 

She was leaning casually against a rail that ran along the wall of the coffee shop and provided a temporary seat. James glanced down discretely, trying to take in exactly how she was sitting on the metal rail, but the heavy outdoor clothing hid the all important detail. Instead he watched as she frequently flicked her shoulder length brown hair back over her shoulder, a cute habit in James&#8217;s opinion. 

With their drinks still unfinished, they started to walk the five minutes back to Karin&#8217;s small flat. James deliberately let her get a few steps in front before following, this really was his last chance to decide whether he wanted to go through with the day as planned. Once at the building, James followed her as she climbed the steps to the fifth floor. He watched with interest as she walked, focusing on the cute crease that formed around her pert butt and the top of her thigh each time she took a step. 

The set up in her flat was basic, but perfectly functional. The smother box was set up in the middle of the spare bedroom. It was constructed of strong hardwood and comprised both the box and a padded bench for its victim to lie on. Both the box and the bench were raised off the floor so that the box lid was at the height of a standard chair. 

"Try?" Karin asked as she lifted up the lid. 

James removed his overcoat and suit jacket and lay on his back on the bench with his head positioned inside the open box. Karin lowered the lid which closed tightly around his throat and then removed her jacket to reveal a fitted white jumper underneath. Although it was getting too late to change his mind, James craned his eyes to assess her figure and was pleased to see a perfect hourglass, with a narrow waist curving out over full womanly hips and a cute butt.

A few seconds later it was too late as Karin casually dropped down on to the edge of the closed smother box and sat with her jeans less than an inch away from the hole and James&#8217;s face. She removed her glasses and rubbed her eye to remove a speck of dust that was causing an irritation. With the irritation removed, her focus returned to James. 

"I can padlock if like?"

From his position, the woman sitting on top looked more than capable of keeping the lid shut with her weight alone, but as she was already holding an unlocked padlock, he decided he should play along. "Sure," he replied.

Karin closed the hasp and locked it in place with a cheap looking padlock that grated metal on metal as it closed. Cheap or not, it would hold him. He tried to wriggle his head back out of the box, but with the lid close it was obviously impossible.

�Trap.� she said as she waived a finger as if telling off a kid.

�Yes, I see.�

Karin slid her butt off the edge of the box lid and was now fiddling with four short lengths of chain that were attached to the bench, positioned by each of his wrists and ankles. 

"And lock here also?"

"Yes, sure."

James couldn't see much as Karin spent several minutes padlocking chains around his wrists and ankles.

"They're quite tight."

Karin stopped and looked at him with a puzzled look on her face. OK it was his fault for not learning some basic German. Certain German phrases, such as 'I can't breathe&#8217;, could proved to be useful.

James was also concerned about the size of the smother box. It wasn't that deep and as a result, his face protruded slightly through the hole in the lid. At the same time, the inside of the box was padded which made it fit tightly around his head. As a result, there was no way he could turn his head from side to side if required.

He watched as Karin pulled her study table over so that it straddled both the bench and his body and could be reached while she was sitting on the box. She walked back and forth collecting pens and books to set her up for the morning. James spent his time trying to grab glimpses of her butt as she walked, to better understand what the day might be like. 

"Panties, yes?" Karin asked, having obviously brushed up on that word. 

"Sure."

"Good, best for me too."

James smiled, he'd never really considered it from her point of view. Sitting on an uneven surface in jeans probably would be less comfortable for her too, although at least she wouldn&#8217;t be at risk of a broken nose.&nbsp; 

Karin unbuttoned and eased out of her worn jeans to reveal pale pink satin underwear. One side had ridden up her butt and she pulled it back out as she arched her back and stretched up. Karin&#8217;s butt really was her best feature, full and cute at the same time, no doubt the result of living on the fifth floor of a lift-less building.

Karin stood on the bench with one foot either side of James&#8217;s chest wearing a strange ensemble of white jumper and pink panties. Even from there, James could smell the perfume that she'd sprayed over her butt, which was strange as he hadn't smelt perfume on her face when they'd kissed earlier. Maybe that was fair enough for someone in her line of work. He tried to identity her brand of perfume as she lowered herself down on to his face, so that she was looking towards his chained up body.

At first she was very gentle, taking much of her weight through her hands that rested on either side of the box. She moved back and forth until she was happy with her position, but once there she removed her hands and sat on him with her full weight. 

"OK we start."

This was not a question, but a statement as she straightened her legs out in front of her, keeping a small gap between her thighs so that he could breath. She looked around her to make sure she had the hole completely sealed and then flicked her hair back and shrugged her shoulders. Karin was now sitting fully on James&#8217;s face with only his bottom lip peeping out from under her crotch. All of his other features were gone from view. 

Karin's slightly fuller figure was enough to completely seal his face. She even ran her fingers around where her butt met the padded box lid to ensure that all was air tight. James' only air now filtered into his mouth through the small gap between Karin&#8217;s almost closed thighs. The air down there was limited and heavily scented, but was just adequate to keep him alive.

Although dark, silent and airless, beneath Karin&#8217;s butt was certainly not an unpleasant place to be. Her butt was warm, beautifully so, having just been released from the tight jeans. While her flat may have been cold, Karin's butt ensured that everything sealed up in the box beneath it stayed warm. 

"Nose nose nose." Karin said aloud to herself having learnt the word especially. She actually enjoyed the feeling of it pushed deep between her cheeks. The nose&#8217;s sensitive sense of smell and delicate airway were rendered completely useless, but at least it gave Karin a fun sensation between her cheeks.

It had only been a couple of weeks earlier when James had been surfing the web while at home on a particularly boring conference call. Google had helpfully translated the page from its original German. 'Long time face sit' the translation hadn't been great but he understood. A German student was offering a full day of face sitting, guaranteed six hours. James liked the simplicity and efficiency of the idea. If she was sitting around studying anyway, and if there was a market for her services, why not sit on something more than just a chair.

Six hours under some strange girl's butt! The idea seemed crazy, at first, but later the idea started to obsess him. Then a few emails and meeting changes later and his next work trip to Germany included a free day. 

Even before Karin had sat down, James&#8217;s cock had been rock hard. Five minutes later and he was ready to relieve himself, but his chained hands couldn&#8217;t get anywhere near.

"......." He tried to talk but his lips wouldn't move, being totally immobilised by her weight.

As talking didn't work, he rattled his chained hands repeatedly in an attempt to get the woman&#8217;s attention. Karin put down her pen and leaned to one side so that one half of her butt lifted up from his face.

"Six hours, yes." Again it wasn't a question.

"Yes, but ...." Was all James managed to say before the front of her pink panties rested back down on his mouth.&nbsp; 

He rattled again and Karin responded by closing her thighs. Within a few seconds James found it harder to breath. Karin again stopped studying and looked down at her lap to monitor the situation. Only when the rattling of chains stopped did Karin open her thighs slightly. She smiled as she heard the desperate intake of air from beneath her.

"Only good boy have air." She said as she returned to her work. 

Karin continued to read her notes and then started to answer questions from previous exam papers. She filled one page with her scribbles and then turned over and continued to write. It was going well, if this question came up in this year's exam then she would be fine. An hour had passed and she hadn't once thought about the guy beneath her. 

James lay still in his sealed prison, he now knew what would happened if he made a noise. The big thighs above him would touch, skin against skin. Barely any movement on her part, but it would cut his air supply. As far as he knew that could result in his death. 

But then she was giving him what he&#8217;d signed up for. All was black and silent. He was in complete sensory deprivation, apart from her scent that he was breathing in. The perfume was fading to reveal more of her own fragrance. He was turned on for sure, but he also felt very relaxed. Beneath Karin was a very calming place. There was nothing he had to do, indeed absolutely nothing he could do. 

The hole in the lid of the box was his only window on to the real world and Karin&#8217;s butt and thighs filled it completely. As such he was fully focused on those parts of her body. Occasionally she would shift her weight, slightly changing the way she was sitting. Although these movements were slight, they represented big news down in his tiny world. 

Karin finished the exam paper and turned on the radio. Although the sound of the radio was barely audio to James, he could feel the small vibrations as she tapped her foot on the bench.

She wriggled her body and felt his features beneath her. She loved the power this work gave her. It wasn't often in life that you could snap shut padlocks and leave someone helplessly in chains. And then stimulate yourself by sitting on their face. And with her personalised panty blindfold pressing directly on his eyes and taking away his sight, there was no risk of him seeing what she was doing.

She lent to the left and lifted her butt off one side of the box. As she'd been sitting for so long, her skin had stuck slightly to the black padding of the lid. Her pink satin underwear had also stuck to his face and it peeled off as she moved. �OK in there?�

James looked up at her with his one free eye trying to read her expression, which was a mix of confidence, arousal and sleepy all at once. He opened his mouth to reply, but was too late as she sat back down, once again putting his mouth into a panty straitjacket. 

With true German efficiency, Karin stood up exactly three hours after she had sat down. "Lunch now."

Still chained up in the smother box, James angled his eyes as best he could, but with his face held firmly in place, there was very little he could see other than the old peeling paint on the cracked ceiling. 

"Wow, that was amazing!"

Karin smiled as she eased her jeans back up. "You welcome." She then perched on the edge of the still locked smother box and looked down at him. 

"Is jeans OK?"

"Yes, very nice."

Karin smiled and edged a little closer so that the edge of her butt was touching the side of his nose, her hair now falling down partially covering her face.

"I can do dress also?"

"Dress? Sure."

Karin stood up and stretched and flicked her dark hair back over her shoulders. Without appearing to be in much of a hurry, she started to unlock the padlocks and opened the box. 

By the time James had climbed to his feet, Karin had already disappeared into her bedroom and so James stretched and then hunted around for the toilet. The bathroom was small and badly decorated, but well ordered and clean. He found the bottle of perfume that he had been breathing in all morning. It wasn&#8217;t a big name brand, just a cheap copy.

When James returned, Karin was standing in the middle of the small lounge wearing a short black cocktail dress and heels. She had also put on a little make up and her hair was up in a bun. She&#8217;d also removed her glasses even though everything was now slightly blurred. The truth was she liked her attractive, polite guest and despite their brief and very unusual encounter, she wanted to make an effort. 

"Like?"

"Beautiful."

"And special." Karin pulled up her dress to reveal the briefest of black thongs. 

James smiled, even though he preferred her previous choice of underwear, the thong leaving nothing to the imagination. It revealed her whole butt, making it look slightly larger and therefore more intimidating. The g-string was buried almost out of sight between her cheeks.

"In."

"That was a quick lunch break," he replied as he climbed back on to the bench and positioned his head in the box. Karin quickly closed the lid and sat down on one edge. James playfully tried to reopen the box, but Karin just edged a little closer, looked down and shook her head. 

"No possible."

As he pretended to try to lift the lid, he accidentally placed his hand on her thigh. Karin didn&#8217;t say anything, but stopped moving and closed her eyes. James watched her and left his hand there for a few seconds before slowly sliding it off.

�Staying!� she ordered, embarrassed by the silence that had followed.

Karin stood up and walked away, her little black dress bouncing as she went. James listened as cupboards opened and closed in the kitchen. He could have escaped, the smother box wasn't locked and there was no girl sitting on top, but he remembered the look she'd given him earlier when he&#8217;d disobeyed her and decided he should &#8216;staying&#8217;. 

When she returned, Karin moved her table to the other side of the smother box. She then relocked the chains around James hands and feet and re-padlocked the box lid. She sat on the edge of the lid the other way round, now facing away from his body. She opened her legs, pulled back her dress and looked down at James&#8217;s face that was showing between her bare thighs. 

"Face other way." 

"Sure, that would be ...." James was getting used to his replies being cut short as Karin lifted her skirt and slid forward so that she was sitting on his mouth and nose, with just one eye peeking out from deep in her crotch. 

"......."

"What?" She slid backward just enough to let him talk, although his lips were still touching her thong. 

"......."

Again she slid forward just as he was about to speak. She giggled at the look of frustration showing in his one visible eye. Karin slid backwards again but this time James decided to stay quiet.

 �Good boy.� 

With the lesson learnt, Karin took some of the bread and cheese that she had prepared and pushed it down between her thighs and into his barely exposed mouth. 

She had deliberately positioned herself so that she was sitting on his chin and lower lip, and she knew from experience that she would get a very pleasant massage as he ate. The poor hungry guy would try and move his jaw, no matter how difficult that was in his desperate attempt to fill up. And the bread that Karin had chosen certainly needed chewing.

Karin threw her head back and enjoyed the feeling. All she had to do when it stopped, was to open her legs, hand down another piece of bread and then close up. She knew that mealtime spent this way could last at least an hour.

"Bye bye." With lunch over, Karin pulled her cheeks out and slid forward until his nose was resting comfortably against the front of her black silk underwear. With her legs apart, he had been able to see. However that didn&#8217;t last long as her legs moved together meaning total darkness for guy beneath. 

James lay there trying to keep his nose as far from her panties as possible. Breathing was dependent on there being at least a small gap between his nose the front of her black thong. But as Karin continued to study and her mind wondered the stimulation from his nose made her sub consciously slide forward. 

After ten minutes, and with his nose now buried deeply into the front of Karin's underwear, James started to rattle his chains. At first she was annoyed, as she was halfway through a timed question, but then she realised the problem and slid back off his face.

"You want breathing?"

�Please!� he panted.

She reached over and picked up a soft, flexible plastic tube from the nearby cupboard. It was like a small snorkel pipe. She placed one end in James&#8217;s mouth and let the spare end hand over the side of the box. 

"Really bye bye now," she smiled as she slid forward, pulled out her cheeks and sat on him so that she engulfed his face entirely. She jiggled up and down for a few seconds until his nose was where she wanted it and then sat completely still as she closed her eyes and looked up to the ceiling. Her butt had now completely seeled the hole in the smother box lid. 

Karin lifted her dress and then tucked the other end of the plastic pipe down the front of her panties. She positioned it by her clit so that she was stimulated by the suction created by his breathing. Maybe this was unprofessional, but to her it was just a perk of the job. With James gulping down mouthfuls of air straight from her panties, she carefully spread her black dress out to make the guy beneath her &#8216;disappear&#8217;.

Three hours later and James was asleep. Karin could hear his slow rhythmic breathing beneath her and feel the beautifully steady suction against her clit. The front of her panties were now wet and she was a little concerned that some of the moisture may be getting sucked down the tube and into his mouth. 

Karin sprayed her skirt out around her again, to double check he couldn't see what she was doing. She then took the ring that held the keys to the padlocks and played with them in her hand. If she was to lose one of them or even break one, he might have to stay the night. She placed the tip of one of the keys into a small gap beneath her desk and pushed down gently. 

She looked behind her at her guest. An attractive guy and he had voluntarily chosen to spend part of his precious life being sat on by her. He was also trusting her with his life, it made her feel good. She returned to the key that she had squeezed into the desk and pressed a little more. It unlocked one of James wrists. She was very tempted. What would they do if the small key was to snap? She knew that there was no spare.

It was 3pm when Karin closed and piled up her books, this was the time she'd planned to finish both her study and her face sitting. She removed her glasses and rubbed her tired eyes and then held her palms over her eyes to let the heat sink in. She stood up and looked behind her at the sleepy face that had been her seat for the last six hours. She removed the plastic tube from his mouth and ran her fingers around the profile of his lovely chiselled features.

"Is that the time?" James asked sleepily.

"3 o'clock."

James smiled as he tried to lift his arms before remembering that they were still chained down. He rattled them gently and looked up expectantly.

She held up the small key ring. "Chains on."

"Oh yes."

"Did you like?"

"It was fantastic."

"Orgasm for you?" Karin reached down and touched his cock through his suit trousers.

"No thanks."

He couldn&#8217;t believe he&#8217;d just turned down the chance of a hand job. He&#8217;d wanted to come earlier, but now the feeling of being beneath her had turned from just sexual into something else. He wasn&#8217;t sure what.

�No?� she was also surprised.

"For you?" he offered in return.

Karin looked shocked and shook her head.

�Why not?� 

Karin had often thought about getting off by rubbing herself against the guy in the box, but had been too embarrassed to try. She knew from experience that she could be quite loud and anyway the whole point of her service was to arouse the guy and not her. But here was a sexy guy offering her the service. Maybe he would use his lips on her, maybe even his tongue. She sub-consciously put her hand to her mouth as she thought through the possibilities.

She looked down and saw his expectant eyes staring up from the box. They really were cute. He was willing and anyway she had him helplessly chained up, so maybe she should go ahead. 

Apprehensively, she turned and sat back down on the lid, once more facing towards his body. She lifted her skirt and positioned her clit as close as possible to his mouth. In this position, the rest of his face was buried out of sight beneath her. She moved slowly back and forth using his face to stimulate herself, with all the action discretely hidden away under her black cocktail dress.

She cried out as she felt his tongue slide into her tight black silk panties and touch her. Again she put her hand to her mouth, ashamed of her outburst. Ten minutes later and her cries of pleasure were still getting louder, she wasn&#8217;t sure how much more of this she could take. Her panties were wet, her thighs had goose bumps and her hands were clutching the side of the box as if desperately hanging on.&nbsp;&nbsp; 

Twenty minutes later and gasping for breath, Karin finally stood up. 

"Fuck." she breathed.

She stood up, smoothed down her dress and retrieved what looked like a shallow box from the other side of her room. It was actually a cover or second lid for the smother box and could be used to cover up the prisoner. �Thank you,� she breathed as she placed the second lid over James&#8217;s face. 

The box now had a solid shiny metal lid that completely enclosed James&#8217;s head beneath. With her guest now out of sight, Karin stripped off her dress and sat on the lid in just her thong and bra. She pulled her knees up to her chest and wrapped her arms around them and sat there with a big smile on her face.

Half an hour later and Karin had showered and changed into a flowery negligee made of silk with matching panties beneath. Her hair was wet and up in a bun and she wore her glasses over slightly made up eyes. With a little trepidation, she lifted the steel cover to reveal James&#8217;s expectant face.

�Key or not key?� she asked as confidently as she could as she knelt on the smother box and rattled her key ring above his face.

�Not key?� he replied, uncertain what that actually meant, but in no hurry to leave Karin&#8217;s company.

It turned out that &#8216;no key&#8217; meant Karin throwing the keys over her shoulder where they disappeared into the small lounge and out of sight. It also meant sitting back on his face, facing away from his body, and smiling at his one eye that was visible between her legs.

Karin then flicked on the television and started to watch. James looked up and watched her smiling face, until at one point she realised he was looking at her. She simply closed her legs condemning him to further sensory deprivation in the tomb beneath her.

It was past 8pm when Karin finally stood up.

"Thanks you," she smiled as she started to unlock the padlocks that secured his hands and feet. James tried to stand up but the smother box padlock was still locked.

"You want me open also?" she asked.

�Unfortunately, I have to go now.�

Karin looked disappointed as she unlocked the remaining padlock and James climbed to his feet and stretched. They looked at each other and smiled, not quite sure what to say. 

"That was amazing, thank you," James finally said as he kissed Karin on both cheeks. 

"Your pleasure," she replied. James smiled at her cute misuse of English. 

"Proper kissing bye bye?"

James looked confused at first, but then Karin turned around and he understood. He knelt down and ran his hands up her bare legs and up under her short negligee. With her butt revealed, he placed his lips at the fold where her thigh met her butt and continued to worship from there. Neither of them was in any hurry. 

James eventually stood up and picked up a small length of spare chain that was lying on an old chest of drawers. 

"Can I have a souvenir?"

Karin didn't understand and so James draped the short length of chain around his left wrist. Karin understood and picked up a small padlock and gently threaded it through the two loops at the end of the chain. Her pale, ringless fingers gently squeezed the old padlock until its unoiled mechanism finally clicked. 

"How you escape?"

James shrugged as he pulled his shirt sleeve back down, covering his new bracelet. He hadn&#8217;t thought that one through yet.

They kissed again on both cheeks and then James left Karin&#8217;s small apartment. He looked back at her standing in the shabby doorway. A woman in a nightdress, average height, average looks, dishevelled hair hanging over her glasses. Yet she had given him one of the most exciting days of his life. With this image in his mind, he made the short walk back to the station. 

***

James made his way straight to the station bar and ordered a bottle of local beer. He was in a daze, his phone had already rung twice and he just hadn&#8217;t bothered to answer it. All he could think about was the day with Karin. He felt the chain still locked around his wrist and smiled, there was only one key in the world that would open that lock and it belonged to Karin. That felt nice, he had no intention of trying to remove it.

He moved to a table at the back of the bar and pulled out his phone and typed in her website address. The photos didn&#8217;t do her justice and they certainly couldn&#8217;t portray what it felt like to have her sit on your face. 

&#8216;Head scissors&#8217; was another service she offered. There were no photos demonstrating what she would do, but from his knowledge of her thighs, James knew it wouldn&#8217;t be an unpleasant experience. He pulled himself back to reality to find that he had finished his beer and was already totally aroused.

It was dark outside and it would be a cold night. He had planned to fly back home on the redeye, but was there another option? He smiled to the waitress who brought his second beer as he started to text.

&#8216;Karin, wonderful day, thanks. Free tonight?&#8217;

&#8216;Come,&#8217; she texted back.

It was all the encouragement James needed. He headed out into the cold night and was soon back outside her small flat. 

Karin answered the door. Her hair was down and lay randomly around her head, she&#8217;d removed her glasses and was squinting slightly to see him in the dimly lit hallway. She was wearing a black night dress that barely reached past her butt, it was old and slightly ripped over one shoulder.

�Pretty not,� she said as she picked at her lips.

�You look fantastic.�

James followed her inside and watched her dig around in her jeans for her keys.

�Here, I unlock.�

�No, no, I just wanted to try something else....umm head scissors.�

Karin thought for a moment. 

�You understand?� he asked. 

She nodded, she certainly understood those words. She had been delighted to see James again, in fact she had fantasised about him calling her, but in her fantasises, he was taking her out for dinner and then back to make love. This wasn&#8217;t quite the same, but it did still give her the chance to spend the night with him. 

�For all night, no escape.�

James hadn&#8217;t expected that, but he wasn&#8217;t going to complain and dutifully followed her into her bedroom.

He stood in the middle of her small room as Karin removed his suit jacket and unbuttoned and removed his shirt and trousers. With James standing in only his boxer shorts, Karin couldn&#8217;t help but run her hands quickly over his arms and chest. He was fitter than most of her recent dates and still he was paying her to be there. She hoped this would live up to his expectations. 

Karin pulled back the covers and lay down on her bed. She indicated for James to lie down next to her, but with his head down at the foot of the bed to that they were lying head to toe. They both lay on their sides facing each other so that James was look straight at Karin&#8217;s thighs. Once in position, Karin pulled up her night dress and lifted her top leg.

�Inside for you.�

James paused to examine her legs. For a slim woman, she had beautifully curves and her butt and legs were the best part. Up close they seemed large and strong, but not in a muscled way, there was plenty of feminine shape.

James eased his head between her thighs and let Karin pull him right up into her crotch, so that his face was buried into the lower part of her butt. Karin lowered her thigh back down to trap his head between her legs. 

�Comfortably?� she asked.

�Yeah,� he replied.

In the cold room, Karin&#8217;s thighs felt wonderfully warm around his neck, somehow managing to be both soft and scarily secure at the same time. Right in the middle of his limited field of view was her cute butt with which he was already very well acquainted. Yet he was still obsessed with its beautiful shape and the way it was barely contained in her tight white satin panties.

�This is your danger,� she announced.

�Danger?�

�If you try get out before tomorrow.�

With that Karin squeezed, her legs and butt working in unison to crush his neck. Within a few seconds James was madly tapping out with his hand on the mattress.

�Fuck Karin!� he was hoping she might let him out to recover, but she held him in place with the previous comfortable pressure.

�You understand?� she checked.

�I understand.�

He lay there completely still and slightly shaken, wondering how something so beautiful could also be so deadly. Where the hell did that strength come from? He looked again, this time more warily, at her soft perfumed legs that surrounded him. 

Karin pulled a duvet over them both, positioning it so it only just covered her thighs and butt and in so giving James a gap through which he could get fresh air. She switched off the small table lamp and lay down.

�Karin?�

�No talking,� she whispered as she tensed her thighs as a warning.

James felt far too excited to sleep. Her soft warm legs felt fantastic and he amused himself by gently kissing her butt. She didn&#8217;t react by squeezing his throat and so he assumed she must be enjoying his attention. After a while he got a little braver and tried to ease his lips underneath the hem of her panties. He didn&#8217;t get far, defeated by the tight elastic.

Suddenly Karin&#8217;s legs twitched and then again. James listened and realised that she was asleep. All her movements were now subconscious, no doubt as a result of her dreams. She twitched and tensed again. It was like having a neck massage, one that would probably last all night.

He buried his nose into her panties, pushing in between her butt cheek, and breathed. Almost instantly he was rewarded with another involuntary squeeze from her thighs and a small moan. 

Exploring his predicament was providing no end of fun. James tried to lift his head to see if he could open Karin&#8217;s thighs. Nothing moved, she evidently slept with her muscles tensed, or at least she was tonight. As he relaxed again, he noticed that her grip around his neck had increased in reaction to his escape attempts. 

�OK, sweetheart, I&#8217;m not going anywhere,� he said, his lips brushing across her butt as he spoke. Her grip didn&#8217;t reduce, she still seemed to be compensating for his earlier attempt to open her legs. James ran his hand along her legs and could feel the muscles working with no way to turn them off. It felt wonderful, warm and safe and completely consuming.

An unknown time later, when James had been running his fingertips over her butt and watching the small hairs stand on end, the situation changed. Without warning, Karin relaxed her top thigh slightly, moved her hips back and tightened her gip again. It was a small movement but it resulted in James&#8217;s head being pulled further between her thighs. She did it again, thrusting his head tighter and tighter between her legs.

Karin&#8217;s inner thighs now rested against the sides of his head and blocked out all sound from his ears. Of more concern, though, his mouth and nose were now deep between her legs squashed up against the bottom of her butt and now without access to air. He tried to pull back out, but her thighs, now tacky from perspiration held him in place.

James didn&#8217;t want to wake her up. Even the demonstration of what she would do if he misbehaved had almost killed him. What would it be like to be squeezed between her thighs when she had just being woken up.

He strained his head left and right and finally found&nbsp; a position where his nose could suck in a small amount of air. It certainly wasn&#8217;t fresh air, it was coming from about as deep in her crotch as it was possible to get, but it would keep him alive.

Before a little light had streamed in under the blanket, but now he had nothing. With his eyes pushed up against where her thighs met her butt, it was pitch black, damp, almost airless and the atmosphere was getting more and more strongly filled with her scent. Staying alive was now taking effort and yet Karin was still sleeping peacefully. She still twitched as she dreamt, with the twitches that coursed through the woman&#8217;s strong thigh muscles crushing James head as they passed.

In felt warm and safe deep in Karin&#8217;s crotch, but James missed not been able to see her cute little ass. He decided to reach up and run his hands over her backside instead, but by doing so he inadvertently caused her to cry out in her sleep and thrust her hips forward. The resultant tightening of her butt cut James&#8217;s air supply completely. He took his hands away and waited for her to relax so he could breathe again. 

That was fun and so he ran his fingertips over her butt and waist again. Again she cried out in pleasure and again she thrust forward. Again James felt as though his head was set in a sealed block of concrete. 

James lay there exploring other ways to tease and stimulate this beautiful sleeping woman. She was certainly a heavy sleeper, nothing he&#8217;d tried yet had come close to waking her, but maybe he had changed the course of her dreams. Karin was moaning from time to time and her body twitched and fidgeted more than before. She was also increasingly pushing her hips back and forth as if trying to arouse herself against him. 

Being so intimately connected to a horny, sleeping girl felt great and meant that James had been aroused himself for most of the night. Karin being aroused had also created a build up of heat and pressure between her legs. James had to lie still for a while waiting for her to relax again, maybe then he could even get his head out of the deepest confines of her crotch and then maybe even get some sleep.

It hadn&#8217;t worked. James had spent the rest of the night in exactly the same position and hadn&#8217;t even come close to sleeping. He was hot, inundated with her scent, aroused and completely exhausted when she finally woke.

�Hi, morning,� Karin said with her sleepy voice. 

After getting no reply, she looked behind and saw James&#8217;s face pushed up hard between her legs. She opened her tacky thighs a little and thrust her hips forward so that his head once more stuck out from between the back of her thighs. 

�Morning,� James&#8217;s dry mouth barely moved, but at least he was back in fresh air, once more facing her beautiful butt.

�You sleep?� Karin&#8217;s face was still hidden behind a bundle of wild hair.

�No, but I&#8217;m not complaining.�

Karin felt the front of her panties and was embarrassed by how wet she was. She must have multiple wet dreams, but she was hardly surprised given who she&#8217;d had between her legs.

�Open up?� James tapped Karin&#8217;s&#8217; thigh as if conceding a wrestling match.

�No.�

�Karin?� James was now feeling claustrophobic after eight hours between her damp thighs and started to try to force his way out.

�You forget?� Karin tensed up and squeezed.

James buried his face back into the crotch of her panties and cried out in frustration, how was he going to get away from this crazy girl.

Within seconds, though, James&#8217;s cries had changed from pain to pleasure. Karin had slipped her hand inside his boxers and was running her fingers over him. It was his quickest and most intense time ever and he closed his eyes and enjoyed the natural drugs running through him. 

James&#8217;s eyes were now closed and he felt incredibly tired as he lay there.

�Do you want me to open?�

�No,� he was almost asleep.

�Last chance or I will time lock you two hours.�

Karin started to count down from ten to one. When she reached one James felt a small squeezed around his neck to signify that the prison was now locked. Karin was explaining in a mix of broken English and German how she would absolutely not open up for at least two hours as James fell asleep. 

It was past ten o&#8217;clock when Karin finally released him. He lay on the bed watching Karin&#8217;s butt bounce as she made her way to the bathroom. When she returned she sat down on the bed right next to James&#8217;s head and he reached around her and pushed his face into the outside of her thigh.

�Did you sleep well?� James asked interested to know what his attention had meant for her sleep.

�Really good for all night.�

�I thought you enjoyed yourself.�

Karin crossed her legs to try and hide her wet underwear. 

�Maybe I should paid to you,� she said standing up and pulling on a pair of old grey track pants and white t-shirt.

James showered and returned to drink a cup of black coffee that she had made for him. When they were both standing, he was taller and bigger than her, yet he&#8217;d spent the whole night convinced that she was some kind of giantess. It was bizarre how the female body could do that to a guy&#8217;s mind.

Whereas Karin&#8217;s mind still hadn&#8217;t worked out why this sexy guy was paying her, he was turning her on as much as she was him. Her eyes flicked across his body and she remembered the chain that she&#8217;s locked around his wrist the night before.

�Bracelet?� 

�Yes. I can&#8217;t really take it off without your key.�

To James&#8217;s surprise Karin produced the key from inside her bra.

�Would you want other hand?�

James nodded and held out his other hand and dutifully waited for Karin to padlock another shout length of chain around it. James tugged on the padlock and chain to confirm it was locked far too tightly to ever slide off his wrist.

�Is this key in your bra as well?�

�I can put where you liking.�

�You know where I liking,� James smiled as he pulled on his jacket and walked towards the door. Again, standing there in old casual clothes, Karin looked very ordinary and James couldn&#8217;t quite believe how such an unassuming girl had exerted so much power over him. He followed her out to the front door where she gave him a kiss on his lips.

�Anytime you want more please come.�

James was just about to open the door when Karin grabbed one of his wrists and hooked yet another padlock through the chain. She then pulled his other wrist over and looped the same padlock through the chain that encircled his other wrist.

�I can lock for you?� she purred.

�Then my hands would be chained together.... difficult for the plane.�

He looked at the padlock that she held between her fingers. 

�How would I get home?�

�Maybe you have to come back, begging the keys.�

James was swallowing hard, this was all getting complicated.

�OK,� he replied hesitantly.

Karin had closed the padlock almost before James had closed his mouth. He pulled and twisted to confirm that his wrists were chained together.

�The keys?� he asked.

�Come tonight.�

 ***

Karin closed her front door in his face and locked it leaving James standing on the door step, unsure of what to do next. Only then did he realise that he&#8217;d left his bag inside her flat. Being separated from a few dirty clothes wasn&#8217;t a problem, but she now had his passport which made returning home even harder. He knelt down and looked through the keyhole just as Karin inserted her key and all he could do was listen as she engaged the deadlock.

�Karin, my bag?�

She giggled as she withdrew the key and walked back through the small hallway.

James looked down at his chained hands and experimented until he could clasp his hands together in a way that both hid the chain and looked least suspicious. He surveyed the street and saw a cafe just up a little and started to walk there as naturally as he could. 

Karin didn&#8217;t live in the nicest neighbourhood and James felt out of place in his suit. Getting into a fight with his hands chained up would only end badly. He ducked into the cafe and was pleased to that it was reasonably OK, with booths at the back. He slid as far as he could into the very back booth and ordered coffee and toast from the blonde waitress. 

James had already decided that he would cancel his meetings and stay in Germany for another day. That was easy enough, but spending the day in an unknown city while hiding the fact that his hands were chained was not going to be easy. What had Karin been thinking?

He thought through his options. Buying a hacksaw or bolt cutters wouldn&#8217;t work. With his wrists chained so closely together there was no way he could use the tools without help. A locksmith was also out of the question, there was no way he was going to share his predicament with anyone. Anyway, he didn&#8217;t know the German words for &#8216;I let some crazy girl padlock my hands together&#8217;. Picking the locks was also impossible. The way she&#8217;d chained him, with his wrists almost touching, he could barely even reach them. There was only one option.

&#8216;Cafe across road, let me buy you breakfast. James x.&#8217; he sent the text and started to drink his coffee two handed.

He had to wait half an hour before Karin finally appeared, dressed in leather jacket and jeans. With her hair up in a ponytail, wearing glasses and carrying books she looked every bit the student. She slid along the booth and sat opposite James.

�What would you like?� he asked as he smiled to the waitress and let Karin order for herself.

�What?� she was leaning forward and staring right into his eyes.

 �I really can&#8217;t spend the day like this,� James pulled his shackled hands from under the table to show her and then quickly hid them back out of sight.

�Key in my jeans pocket, come.�

James knew she wasn&#8217;t going to make this easy for him, but he probably didn&#8217;t realise how difficult she would make it. As he started to slide back out of the booth, Karin stopped him and pointed under the table. James protested, but Karin just ignored him and drank her coffee.

With no option, James checked that they weren&#8217;t being watched and then ducked underneath the table and edged over to Karin&#8217;s crossed legs. He reached up and tried to push his fingers into one of the front pockets of her jeans. The jeans had been well fitting when she&#8217;d been standing, but now she was sitting, the denim was pulled even more tightly around her hips. This in turn sealed the entrance to her pockets even more tightly. James soon gave that up and instead ran his hands along the outside of her jeans only to find that both front pockets were empty. 

With Karin pretending to ignore the guy touching her under the table, James reached around and soon discovered that the back pockets of her jeans were pinned beneath her butt and therefore completely inaccessible.

�Karin, lift up, please,� he whispered.

To James surprise, Karin leant over and lifted one side of her butt off the black vinyl bench. James saw a small bulge in her back pocket which he guessed was the keys. He reacted as fast as he was able, but still couldn&#8217;t get his chained hands to her pocket before she sat back down. 

James tried to push her to one side so he could access her pocket, or at least slip a hand inside, but she was easily able to stop him. 

�Karin, please!�

This time he heard giggling from above the table. Karin couldn&#8217;t help herself, James&#8217;s predicament and the feel of his strong hands on her body were making her feel hot and sexy. She was eager that he stay down there longer.

She uncrossed her legs, lifted one and placed it back down between his chained hands. She then wrapped her ankles together to form a continuous loop, a loop that was now linked with the continuous loop of James&#8217;s chained hands. She looked forward to feeling him try to escape from that one.

James realised what she&#8217;d done just as Karin called the waitress. Fuck, he didn&#8217;t want to be under the table when the waitress arrived. 

Karin&#8217;s ankles were still crossed, but she&#8217;d opened her knees. James decided to lean forward and use his shoulders as leverage to force open her ankles. He moved forward, but Karin was way ahead of him. As soon as his head passed between her knees, she snapped them back together around his neck. He knew things must be getting worst as he heard Karin trying to suppress more giggles.

The waitress was now standing by the table talking to Karin, though fortunately he was still out of sight beneath the far end of the booth table. He just had to keep quiet , but even that wasn&#8217;t easy as Karin was squeezing him hard between her knees and he struggled to avoid choking.

Karin was getting off on the situation and the harder she squeezed, the better it felt. By the time she released him and he&#8217;d struggled back to his seat, she was very aroused.

�Karin, I need the keys!�

�Key in my jeans, I tell you.�

�Mmm, it&#8217;s dangerous down there,� James observed as he sipped his new coffee and watched her intently, the fact that she was close to orgasm was easy to see. No doubt she could see the same in his eyes.

Karin&#8217;s had to get some air before her feelings got out of control. She stood up, leaned across the table and kissed James on the cheek. She gave him one more cute smile, blew a kiss and walked out.

Shit, he was still chained up. James struggled to pull his wallet out of his hip pocket and clumsily pulled out some notes. As he stood up he realised the waitress had been watching him and had seen the chains around his wrists. She walked towards him, seemingly intrigued by his situation and sat down on the end of the bench so that James couldn&#8217;t get out.

�Hi,� she said.

James was so focused on Karin and the keys that he didn&#8217;t even notice the woman as she pulled up his suit sleeves to inspect the chains. 

�I wish I had the keys,� she said in good English as she gently lay his conjoined wrists back down.

�That&#8217;s makes two of us,� he smiled, amazed by the obvious come on. It seemed that being chained in public was common place in this part of the world.

James pulled another large note from his wallet and put it on the table in front of her. She may not have had the keys, but it wouldn&#8217;t be easy getting out of the booth unnoticed with her sitting there. Maybe a tip would help.

Knowing that she hasn&#8217;t going to get anymore of his attention and pleased with the extra tip, the waitress stood up and watched with a smile as James left the cafe as discretely as possible. James wasn&#8217;t bothered about the extra Euros, but was annoyed that he&#8217;d now lost Karin and his only hope of getting out of the chains.

&#8216;Karin, maybe I can buy you lunch too?&#8217; he texted from a bench in the park. 

He waited, unable to much else, and pissed that he had let her go at the cafe.

His phone beeped with the name of a clothes shop.

He&#8217;d seen the shop in the main shopping area, the provocative dresses on the manikins in the window had been hard to miss. He quickly walked there while trying not to draw attention to himself and found Karin standing outside the changing rooms. 

She was wearing a tight red halter neck top and very tight black leather shorts. The shorts were probably a size too small for her, but they were amazing at showcasing her hips. James took a seat and watched her as she walked towards him with her sexiest hip swaying walk. She turned and rolled her hips as she walked back into the changing rooms.

�Karin?�

She could hear his English accent as he tried to open the changing room door from the outside and she had to suppress a giggle as she heard a shop assistance asking him in German to leave the woman&#8217;s dressing rooms.

Karin changed into the long red dress that she had been wanting for ages. It was another halter neck, but then split at the front to make for a very revealing cleavage that was held together by crisscrossing straps. It then tightened up around the waist and hips and reached down to below the knee. It fitted very tightly around her waist, hips and legs and with no split, it was difficult to walk.

It left little to the imagination around the breasts, but left everything to the imagination down below. Once zipped into the dress, everything around the woman&#8217;s butt was well and truly sealed. &#8216;That will frustrate him&#8217; Karin thought as she dropped the keys into her panties and then eased herself into the dress.

The effect upon James was evident as soon as she opened the dressing room door and proceeded to walk towards him, carefully with small steps.

�Wow!� he breathed as he ran his chained hands over her, running the risk of being seen.

�Keys,� she purred as she took his hands and positioned them on her butt.

�Yes, I wish they were out here,� he replied and then after a moment&#8217;s thought continued, �And I wish I were inside.�

�I shrink and put you in, later?� she offered as she kissed James and walked back to the dressing room. The dress was even turning her on, what must James be thinking.

When Karin reappeared she was back in her jeans and black leather jacket. She casually dropped both outfits into his lap and quickly left the shop. James instinctively followed her, only to set off the alarms as he tried to leave the shop while still holding the clothes.

Two assistants appeared from nowhere and one took hold of his arm.

�Sorry, sorry!� he apologies as they led him back to the counter. He couldn&#8217;t understand much that they said, although the word &#8216;police&#8217; was mentioned several times. 

�I buy, I buy,� he was speaking pigeon English and fumbling with his credit card, while one of the assistants continued to guard him.

With everything purchased, James hurried flustered out of the shop. The shop assistants had definitely seen his wrists and he&#8217;d been lucky to get out without being arrested. And worse of all, he&#8217;d lost Karin again and therefore lost track of the keys that followed her dutifully around in her back pocket.

He called and texted her, but she didn&#8217;t answer. He went to her flat, again no answer, but he left the new outfits for her outside her front door. A peace offering that might eventually get him out of Karin&#8217;s most effective handcuffs. 

He then returned to the cafe and to the table at the back. The same pretty waitress came to serve him and again she seemed overly fascinated by his chained hands.

�My favourite customer still locked?� she&#8217;d smiled as she slid into the same side of his booth and sat on the table right next to him with her feet on the bench. He&#8217;d ordered and she&#8217;d finally left him alone, but she kept returning to sit on his table and each time she did, she pulled her skirt up a little higher.

James had called and texted Karin over twenty times before he finally received a response. Fortunately he wasn&#8217;t pinned in by the waitress at the time and so jumped up and left the cafe. He quickly made his way back to her flat and in through the open door. 

Karin was standing in the middle of her lounge wearing the red dress. Not only that, she wore heels and make up, even her hair looked different. Whether it was the way she had made herself up, or the power she had over him, but this ordinary girl was starting to look stunning.

�Wow, you look fantastic,� James wasn&#8217;t even pissed by what she&#8217;d put him through that day.

�You too. Sexy chains.�

Oh yes, James had almost forgotten, it now seemed quite normal to have his hands chained up. He kissed her cheek and explored her body encased in her new dress. Shit, how much did he want to get inside.

�Hands and feets!�

James smiled and got down onto all fours and Karin used his back as a temporary seat. The way the slippery fabric of her dress moulded over his muscled body felt sexy and she just had to rub herself against him several times before she rested with her full weight.

Karin picked up a length of chain and padlocked it closely around James&#8217;s neck. She then leaned forward as much as the dress would allow and padlocked the other end of the chain around her left ankle. There were only three links of chain between them. She stood up and positioned herself astride the prostrate guy&#8217;s head. 

Karin loved the fact that James couldn&#8217;t lift his head more than a couple of inches from the floor. She also loved the look in his eyes as he looked up at her and she even opened her legs as far as she could to give him a more interesting view.

Like James, Karin&#8217;s heart rate was steadily increasing as she placed the high heel of her free foot over the chains that secured James&#8217;s wrists so that his hands were also now pinned down by her weight.

�Every time I visit you I get more chains....and you never seem to unlock them.�

Karin giggled.

�Mmm, I&#8217;m not sure you know how to unlock a padlock....I&#8217;ve never seen you do it,� James smiled.

�Maybe all keys in my dress or maybe all lost...� 

There wasn&#8217;t much James could do to get to the keys under either of those scenarios. With escape impossible, he started to kiss the beautiful woman&#8217;s feet.

***

Wearing the sexy elegant red dress, Karin turned and started to walk slowly to the kitchen. Walking was slow, partly due to her tight dress and the unaccustomed high heels, but also because James&#8217;s head was now permanently linked to her left ankle and therefore had to follow it everywhere.

Karin at least could walk normally, if a little slowly, but James had to crawl along beside her, his head bowed submissively to the ground. Each time she took a step he had to follow to avoid being garrotted by the strength of her legs. She picked up a bottle of wine and two glasses and walked back to the lounge and over to her small dining table.

The dining table was surrounded by four unmatched chairs. Three were old and wooden, but the fourth had a metal frame and glass seat and backrest and was more arty and unusual. Karin had bought it from a friend and only afterwards had she realised this particular use.

�Lying down,� she ordered.

With his head tethered to Karin&#8217;s stationary ankle this wasn&#8217;t easy, but finally James was down on his back, lying on the rug with his legs reaching out under the table.

�Beautiful chair,� Karin smiled as she positioned it above his head with the front legs either of his neck and the front horizontal support bar resting just above his throat. There was no way he would be able to get his head out without lifting the chair.

�And which is your chair?� he smiled as he looked up at her through the transparent glass seat above him. 

�Mmm, you see.�

With her body caressed by the sexy dress, Karin slowly and deliberately sat down on the glass. Her left ankle had to stay close to the front of the chair, in close proximity to James&#8217;s neck, but she lifted her right foot and crossed her legs seductively. 

James lay below fascinated by the way the dress had touched the glass and then spread out as her full weight took hold. When seated, the dress was even tighter and he could see the taut fabric holding her body even more snugly inside. The pressure building up on the inside of that sexy dress must have been immense. 

James reached for the metal bar that pinned his throat to the floor and tried to lift. Nothing moved, her weight and the awkward angle meant he had no chance of escaping while she was sitting on top. It was a lovely feeling, held securely down and unable to go anywhere without her permission.&nbsp; 

�It won&#8217;t move,� he said having really tried.

�I know.�

�But I do have a great view of your cute butt.� 

James continued to try to escape and was now getting really turned on by the fact that he couldn&#8217;t budge it at all. He looked up at the woman in the dress sitting above him, she wasn&#8217;t going anywhere and so neither was he.

Karin leaned forward and unbuttoned his shirt to reveal his toned chest and abs that were already tensing from his continued attempts to lift her. 

�Nice,� Karin was digging the heel of her right shoe into his abs and giggling. She could feel vibrations coming through the chair from his efforts beneath her, but he wasn&#8217;t even close to moving her.

�This is impossible,� James laughed as he simultaneously tried to lift the chair and guard himself from her pointed heel.

With James more than distracted, Karin squeezed her hand down through the open cleavage of her dress and tried to reach her fingertips down inside her panties. Yes, she could just reach and she rubbed herself as he continued to struggle pointlessly beneath her. 

�Karin?�

The woman above him had stopped stabbing his chest with her heel and was sitting motionless and breathing heavily above him. But her dress clad butt still sat above him and therefore he was no closer to getting his head out from beneath her chair.

�Wine now.�

�Great, but I think you&#8217;ll have to let me out from under here.�

�I not think.�

James let go of the metal bar and gratefully took the glass of wine that Karin handed down beneath her chair. He carefully poured half of it into his mouth, followed quickly by the rest. A second glass soon followed.

They had started on the second bottle and Karin was already light headed when she stood up and tipped the chair backwards. James couldn&#8217;t believe how easy it had been for her to lift the metal bar from above his neck, it felt as though he&#8217;d expended thousand of calories trying to lift that bar.

�Karin, no!�

He couldn&#8217;t believe it, he hadn&#8217;t moved quickly enough and she&#8217;d lowered the chair back down and sat on it again. The immoveable bar was back above his throat and he pushed and pushed as Karin giggled. The red dress had looked so cute in the shop, but was now taking on a whole different persona.

�Quick now.�

James wasn&#8217;t going to make the same mistake twice and as soon as she stood up and lifted the chair, he moved out from underneath. She lowered the chair back down, but this time he wasn&#8217;t underneath that bloody bar.

Karin walked over to the bathroom, with James crawling along beside her like a very obedient dog. There wasn&#8217;t much he could do other than to walk to heel as she led him into the bathroom.

�The toilet?� James could see where this was going.

Karin used her leg to give him a harder than usual tug on his neck and within seconds they were inside the small bathroom. James was feeling embarrassed and slightly humiliated as he waited on all fours as Karin undid and lifted up her dress. As she pulled down her panties they both heard a clatter of metal against the old porcelain toilet as the keys fell out from where they nestled in her underwear.

�Keys!�

Karin laughed, she was now quite drunk as she pulled the keys from the toilet bowl and walked over to the basin to rinse them. James obediently crawled along beneath her naked butt, with his head between her feet and her panties, which were now around her ankles, resting on his head. Karin then walked back to the toilet and sat down, with James&#8217;s head submissively positioned between her ankles.

�You cold?� she asked as she sat on the toilet and looked down at him between her knees.

�Why do you ask?� James was suspicious. 

�I can warm.�

James watched as she pulled her black satin panties that were already resting on his head, down over his face.

�Karin, you&#8217;re too kind.�

James&#8217;s lips moved against the warm fabric of her underwear. He knew it wasn&#8217;t worth trying to remove them, the pissed crazy girl wouldn&#8217;t like that and would probably padlock them in place. And a padlock clicked shut by Karin tended to stay locked forever. So he just stayed there and listened as she pissed into the toilet above him and hummed to herself.

�Shower now.�

Karin stood and extracted herself from the complicated straps and zips that sealed her inside her dress. She kicked off her shoes and staggered slightly across the floor, pulling James&#8217;s head with her. She then tried to remove her panties only to realise that that was impossible with James chained to her ankle.

�You&#8217;ll have to unlock us,� James asked hopefully. 

�No.�

�OK, but you&#8217;ll have to unlock my hands or I won&#8217;t be able to remove my shirt or jacket.

Karin reluctantly agreed to this one and grabbed her keys and popped open the padlock that secured his two wrist chains. Free twelve hours after she had first clicked it shut. And it was so easy, yet he&#8217;d been trying to open that padlock all day. 

Karin quickly removed all of his clothes and was surprised to see James obligingly holding his hands together so that she could relock them. For some strange reason, he preferred them locked.

�Good boy,� Karin smiled as she relocked his wrists just as tightly.

Completely naked, other than for Karin&#8217;s underwear they showered, at least Karin showered and James caught the warm water that fell from her body. They climbed out and Karin dried herself while James looked up at the key ring that Karin had hung conveniently out of his reach on a hook with her new dress.

James could see three old keys that looked like the keys to his wrists. The padlocks that secured his neck to Karin&#8217;s ankle were new and there were no new keys on the ring.

�Where are the keys to this?� James tugged on the chain that connected them.

Karin held her hands to her mouth and giggled nervously.

�I post to me....maybe come tomorrow.�

Fuck, she really was crazy. 

Karin had been fantasising about this for a long time, being chained to another person, a sexy guy, with no way to separate. It may have stemmed from a lonely childhood or maybe just a love of bondage. Maybe it was why she enjoyed long sessions of face sitting. Once she had a guy beneath her, there was no physical way he could leave her and the skin to skin contact it gave her felt comforting. Maybe it was an unusual form of physical contact to some, but not to Karin. 

Karin pulled up her wet panties that now really were inseparable from her and led James back to her bedroom and up on to her bed. James refocused on the high security padlocks and heavy chain that secured him to her ankle and to which neither of them had the keys. There was no way to escape her body that evening, even if his life depended on it. Again he felt a shot of excitement run through him.

James playfully tickled the foot that he was attached to and immediately regretted it as she fought back. It was apparent that her strong leg muscles, combined with how the chain pulled against his throat meant that she could control him and move him around her bed at will. 

She watched the guy whose tall, sexy body had so intimidated her at the station the previous day and who was now chained to her, kissing her feet as if his life depended on it. His cock was rock hard and she eased it into her mouth.

�Oh fuck,� he cried.

She could do whatever she wanted to him, there was no way he was going to leave her tonight. She started by using her strong thighs to pull his head up to her wet panties and used her other leg to crush his face down into them. Her legs really could do whatever they wanted to his head.

Karin and James lay there stimulating each other, although the already fevered atmosphere meant that the first time was over in almost seconds. After many more orgasms they fell asleep, still chained head to toe. James hugged Karin&#8217;s thigh and Karin buried her head into his narrow waist. They slept deeply, both helplessly shackled together. 

***

James woke the next morning to find himself hugging Karin&#8217;s right thigh. He kissed and pushed his face into her soft pale skin. Embracing just one of her strong thighs was certainly less incapacitating than having his head trapped between her thighs. One at a time, her thighs were soft and warm and worth kissing again.

His attention then turned to the chain and padlocks that connected his neck to Karin&#8217;s left ankle. It was still there, the padlocks were still locked and there were still no keys.

�Guten morgen.� Karin voice was still sleepy.

�Good morning.� He replied as he tried to lift his head up to see over her butt.

Karin used her leg to push his face up against her butt. �Saying good morning.�

�To your bum?�

�Yes!�

Fucking hell, what was he doing here with this crazy German girl. But he was still shackled to her leg and so did as she asked. 

�Good morning Karin&#8217;s butt.� He said and kissed her used black underwear. 

Karin giggled. �You crazy!�

James shook his head in disbelief only for Karin&#8217;s strong legs to yank him again so that his face was now up against the front of her panties. She whispered something in German which he didn&#8217;t understand, which was followed by Karin&#8217;s foot on the back of his head pushing him into her. That part he did understand. He pulled aside her black underwear and kissed her deeper and deeper.

Karin had now stretched the black satin material over James&#8217;s head which pushed his mouth deeper still and made for a very hot and humid atmosphere inside. With James&#8217;s head positioned where she wanted it, she reached down and took hold of his cock. 

Once Karin was satisfied, she straightened her left leg and dragged James head back down the bed. Having kicked James on to the floor, she stood up and walked to her wardrobe with James following her like an over obedient dog; his head never more than a few inches from her ankle. She slipped an old summer dress over her head and led James, who had only been allowed to put on his boxers, to the kitchen.

�When will the keys arrive?� He asked as he knelt obediently by the side of her chair.

She looked confused.

�You understand that!� James craned his neck to look up at her.

Karin giggled before replying in German.

�What?� He asked.

�You not understand?� She giggled.

�Can I have some food then?�

She looked confused and then giggled to herself.

At least this time she hadn&#8217;t pinned down his neck with the chair frame. The metal support that had pinned him the day before felt very solid, the result of sixty kilogram sitting on top. James may have been closer to eighty kilograms, yet still couldn&#8217;t bench press anywhere near her weight. There really was no way to escape from underneath that metal support with her sitting on top.

�Kiss toes!� She demanded.

Karin was now sitting on the edge of the metal chair with her legs open, touching herself. Half of her face was covered by her un-brushed hair which together with yesterday&#8217;s smudged mascara gave her a very ruffled look. 

Just like her fingers, her toenails were unpainted, pale and soft from having spent most of their life in her old trainers. Although James didn&#8217;t have to, he kissed her toes one by one. Karin watched as he also fiddled with one of the old padlocks that secured the chain around his left wrist.

 �Yesterday in the street. You like?� She asked.

�Kinda fun.� James smiled.

�Today you like?�

Karin handed down her phone with a news article that she had helpfully translated into English. There appeared to be some sort of demonstration happening that day against the redevelopment of some parkland. Site clearance was due to start and protestors were threatening to delay that by chaining themselves to the old railings that surrounded the park. 

He handed back her phone. �OK and you think I should join them?�

Karin smiled. 

�Difficult with me chained to your leg.� He replied, it now having been over twelve hours since Karin had chained them together.

Karin pulled her un-brushed hair back behind her ears and put on her glasses. Then with James at her heel, she walked bare foot down the dingy hall to the front door. James tried desperately to keep up with her, which was not easy when walking on all fours with chained hands. 

She crouched down and picked up a white envelope with her own address written in big colourful swirly writing. She ripped it open and took out two silver keys. 

�Fast post.� She said as she unlocked the chain from her ankle.

�And my neck?� James climbed to his feet. 

Kari shook her head and simply hooked the unlocked padlock on to the spare end of the chain that now hung from his neck. �Ready if I want.�

�Ready for what?�

Karin mimicked wrapping the spare end around something and then padlocking it in place. She even made a little click with her tongue as she acted out how she would lock the padlock.

�Ready for my imprisonment.� James summarised, both excited and nervous about the prospect of once again being under this cute German girl&#8217;s lock and key.

They finally reached the park at around midday. Around fifty people, many of them students, were already milling around. Some held banners and all were dressed like Karin in the student uniform of old blue jeans and jacket. James had done his best to blend in with albeit with designer jeans and a smart green shirt. Fortunately Karin had unlocked his wrists and he was able to tuck the high security chain inside his shirt.&nbsp; 

Karin was fidgeting excitedly as she walked past a number of people who had already chained themselves to the old wrought iron railings. She&#8217;d been thinking about this demonstration for some time. She had considered either chaining herself to the railings or simply asking others if they&#8217;d like her to hold their keys. Maybe they&#8217;d accept, after all its much harder to remove someone who doesn&#8217;t have the key. But the current plan was much better and Karin chose a spot and pointed at the concrete pavement.

James was also surprised by how turned he was as he sat down next to a woman in a grey pattern jumped and short black skirt and red heels. She was with a group of friends who were already chained to the railings. She herself had a heavy bike lock around her neck. He smiled at her, but didn&#8217;t understand her long Germanic reply. He just smiled again.

Karin leaned against James with her thigh to ensure he was against the railings and then wrapped the spare end of the chain around one of the thick vertical bars and locked it with the second padlock. The smooth click of the lock sent a shiver up James&#8217;s spine. Maybe he would have preferred her to lock him up with her old chain and padlocks, they might have been an easier prospect for the rescue services in the event that Karin didn&#8217;t return. She had also locked him very tightly with his neck held right against the railings.&nbsp; 

�Too tight?� James questioned as Karin pushed the key deep into the back pocket of her jeans

�Being safe.� Karin stood just out of his reach and smiled.

James then realised that she&#8217;d chained to him to the vertical bar just below the main horizontal bar. Therefore, unlike the others who were also chained to the railings, he wasn&#8217;t able to stand up.

�Karin, you&#8217;ve chained me to the wrong part.�

�I do it.� Karin giggled again as she put on her glasses and turned to read the large placard being carried up the road. 

�Do it? Do what?� James asked

He tried to grab the back pocket of her jeans only to find that she was standing just out of his reach. Then as he was thinking about his next move, Karin simply walked away. 

James&#8217;s cock was rock hard as he watched her butt move. Shit she was fucking sexy and he was loving the feeling of being her prisoner. All too soon she was lost from sight in the crowd. He returned to his predicament and tried to stretch the chain, as if it was elastic. Shit, there was no way out.

The large placard was now getting closer and all the demonstrators were standing up and cheering; at least all of those who hadn&#8217;t been chained up below the horizontal bar. James smiled to himself as the woman next to him slid her neck chain up the railing and her long legs jumped up and down above him.

By midday, everyone was leaving was preparing to join the march through the town. The woman in the short skirt next to him pulled a key from her bra and quickly and easily unlocked the bike lock around her neck. She smiled at James, who she now knew spoke English.

�Give me your key, I unlock you.�

James looked uneasy. �Oh, umm.... my friend has it.�

�Oh!� The woman seemed concern.

�She&#8217;s coming.� James replied, although really not sure whether that was true.

�I wait!�

�No, no, it&#8217;s fine.�

Even though her friends had now left, the woman in the short skirt remained with him and paced back and forth as if protecting him, or even guarding him. Her short skirt flared out and swung around as she paced. As she grew tired, she leaned against the railings where the wind blew her short flared dress against his face. He pushed it away.

�Oh, sorry!�

She wasn&#8217;t. She was enjoying this sexy guy&#8217;s predicament. Big strong guy and yet he was completely helpless. She stood a little closer, just to ensure that he had a good view of her legs. She&#8217;d already seen him look up her skirt, discretely, but she&#8217;d noticed. She wanted to lift the hem of her dress over his head, but she didn&#8217;t dare.

A couple walked past and smiled at her. Yes, they think I&#8217;ve locked him up. She still had her keys in her hand and swung them around her fingesr for the couple&#8217;s benefit. OK, they weren&#8217;t the keys to free this good looking guy, but hey she could pretend they were. 

�Very cold today.� she smiled at James and moved a little closer.

He smiled back, but to her disappointment didn&#8217;t ask to share her skirt. She didn&#8217;t know why, it would have kept him warm and would have made her hot.

 �Where&#8217;s your friend?� The woman asked, happy for her skirt to billow up. 

James shrugged.

�I like it.� She smiled. 

It was now four o&#8217;clock and even the girl in the short skirt had had to leave, promising to return later that night in case James still needed help. The demonstration had long since finished, but still Karin hadn&#8217;t returned. Being chained up in public had fun when he could blend into the demonstration and had been interesting with the short skirt for company, but now it was starting to get painful and embarrassing. He pulled his cap down and tried to avoid attention.

�Sorry, long time.� Karin smiled as she approached.

�Where have you been?�

Karin walked right up to him so that he could smell her familiar scent and relive the many intimate encounters with her young fit body. His frustration turned to arousal.

�How are your day?� She asked, hands on hips.

�Good. You have the key Karin?�

�Off course.�

He smiled as Karin pulled the key out of her pocket and handed it to him. James tried it in both padlocks, but it only unlocked the padlock around the railings leaving him with one end of the chain still padlocked around his neck.

�You have the other key?� He asked.

Karin smiled.

He climbed to his feet and grabbed Karin around the waist. He then slipped his hands into the back pockets of her jeans and pulled her towards him. 

�Where&#8217;s the other key?� He asked as he search her pockets while also feeling her warm round butt. He pushed his hands further inside.

James hadn&#8217;t noticed that the back pockets of Karin&#8217;s jeans could be zipped up and Karin simply reached behind her and zipped them up as far as they would go. James thought she was trying to remove his hands and so pushed them in further. The zips were now pulled tight against James wrists with the zips pushed down to lock them in place. Karin waited patiently for James to realise what she&#8217;d done to him.

�Karin, I can&#8217;t get my hands out!�

�Should not put in.�

It seemed ridiculous, but his hands really were stuck inside Karin&#8217;s pockets, pinned against her warm butt. There was no way James move his hands enough to reach the zips while the denim was pull so tightly around Karin&#8217;s curvy body.

�Park.� She ordered as she jumped up and wrapped her arms around his neck and her legs around his waist.

Looking like a horny couple, James carried her the few metres through the gate and over to a quiet wooded area in the park. He tried to put her down, but she refused to release her grip around his waist and they ended up lying facing each other on the grass. James&#8217;s wrists were still inside her back pockets.

Karin propped herself up on one elbow and looked at him; broad shoulders, sexy smile and completely helpless. She was starting to play out many of her fantasies on this sexy guy, although there were many more still to go. 

First it had been face sitting. James had been the first guy to make it through the whole day. Quite a feat of endurance! Many had baled after only an hour and in fact that was one reason she had started to chain them down. James had even wanted to keep one of the chains locked around his wrist as a souvenir. 

She had expected him to return that night and ask her to unlock him. She certainly hadn&#8217;t expected him to return and ask to spend the night between her legs. What a night that had been! She had pretended to sleep, though she had been far too excited for that. That arousal had made her chain his hands together before he left the next morning. What a stupid idea that had been. How could anyone survive all day in a foreign city with hands chained together? But James hadn&#8217;t argued.

The next night was even better, she&#8217;d had oral sex on tap. Maybe he&#8217;d been too intimidated by the fact she&#8217;d chained him to her ankle, but there really wasn&#8217;t any need. He could easily have overpowered her and called, or even carried her to a locksmith. And then today. She&#8217;d watched him for some of the time, getting off on the fact that she had him trapped.

She returned to his sexy face and his sexy hands that continued to massage her butt in the mistaken hope that they could get free from her pockets. Even though this would probably ruin everything, she kissed him on the lips. After all, there was no way he could fight back.

His kisses were amazing! She closed her eyes and kissed him some more and within minutes, she was pulling down his jeans. She also pulled down her own jeans, but the bare minimum that was necessary as she wanted to keep his hands trapped in her pockets. 

Luckily there had been few people around to hear them make love. Karin had not been quiet. She&#8217;d had only a few boyfriends, but still she felt confident with James. It didn&#8217;t matter, he would soon leave her.

She pulled her jeans back up and re-buttoned them tightly around her waist. His hands were now back in high security.

�This is crazy, we can&#8217;t even speak the same language.� James said as Karin lay smiling on top of him, her body heat keeping him warm. How could he ever get serious with this girl? Ten years younger and totally crazy. Karin&#8217;s pale ring-less fingers, with their short unpainted nails played constantly with the chain around James neck. She was obsessed and in no hurry to let him go.
