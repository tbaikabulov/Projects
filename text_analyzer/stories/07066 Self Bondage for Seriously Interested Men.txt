I hope you will enjoy this account of self bondage, but before I start I feel I need to explain: this is NOT a fictional story: everything you will read here is hard fact, hard earned by trial and error, over a period of several years. I have decided to post this to save others who wish to indulge themselves from having to make the same mistakes as I have. It will contain aspects of masochism and self-humiliation. 
Because this is a factual account, it will necessarily NOT contain the flowery language and imaginations that I see in most self bondage articles, it is written as clearly and simply as possible. Consequently, it may seem a little dry to the casual reader: if so, I will not be offended if you leave, this article is not aimed specifically at you.&nbsp; If I achieve my aim, anybody reading should be able to start self-bondage with some understanding of how to achieve their aims quickly and efficiently.

Firstly, I must set the scene: For several years I have had a job which involved spending some time away each month in nice hotels around the world, they all seem to be similar. That is, a separate bathroom with a shower and a bath tub, quite a large bedroom with a large double bed in it, and blackout style drapes behind the more attractive ones, so darkness can be achieved at any time. I appreciate that this may not fit the conditions you find yourselves in: you will have to adapt accordingly. I was in the position of having time to myself from finishing work throughout the night, often in places where jetlag would wake me up in the middle of the night, like the west coast. This scenario assumes you will start during the night, maybe 6 hours before sunrise.
Secondly, this article may appear to jump backwards and forwards in time, but it seems to me it is impossible not to, as I proceed I hope it will become clear why. Also, I am sure many of you will be interested in the equipment that you need. My intention is to place in BOLD&nbsp; capitals anything that you will need to collect, I hope that it will help.

OK, lets begin. Put the &#8216;do not disturb&#8217; sign on the door! Lock the door from the inside. Ensure that you are not expecting any family or business calls for the duration. Take a TOWEL from the bathroom and place it along the crack of the door, to ensure light from the hallway is kept out. Force something into the hinge crack of the bathroom door to ensure it is absolutely impossible for the&nbsp; door to swing shut.&nbsp; Close the blackout drapes, put the bedside lamp on. If there are any other light sources that can be turned on, remove the bulbs.&nbsp; The safety aspects are now taken care of, so lets get to work.&nbsp; Strip naked, and select a piece of soft PLASTIC FOAM PADDING. I am thinking of the stuff that is often wrapped around valuable articles to post, it tends to come in flat pieces, like bubble wrap but without the bubbles! I hope you can work out what I mean. Cut or rip a piece about 1� wide, and about 5� long. Pull your balls down the best you can, and wrap the foam around your scrotum as high as possible. You should already have prepared a large size PLASTIC LOCK TIE. I am referring to the tie locks you often see used in gardens to tie back shrubs, or cables from your stereo. These tie locks are one way: feed the clip through until the circle created is about 3� diameter. Holding the padding with one hand, feed the lock tie over your balls and the padding and start to tighten. Soon, it should support the padding itself. Slowly tighten as much as you please, its one way so it won&#8217;t undo. Don&#8217;t overdo it. I suggest that you go and make a coffee or something whilst you wait to see if its too tight or not. If not, you can always click it a couple of notches tighter. You may well find that the lock tie may try to slip off the padding behind your balls: adjust accordingly. When you are happy, cut the excess lock tie off with garden SECATEURS.
When you are happy that you have found the correct tightness, take a 12� piece of STRING. Lift your balls and force the end of the string under the lock tie. However tight you have the tie, this is still possible. Tie a knot in the string to hold it in position and leave the 12� dangling between your legs. We will return to this later.

In soft furnishing shops&nbsp; you will often find that they sell STRONG FOAM: you are looking for something to place around your wrists. This is really important: it is really hard to find a material that stops your wrist chains cutting in. You may be able to find some tubular foam that is used to cover pipes, this is good stuff. SELLOTAPE&nbsp; some of the earlier used packing foam around your wrists as far up as you can, as your wrist chain will be pulled that way so you need as much cushioning as possible there. You may even want to put a SOFT SOCK around your wrist as well. If you use the tubular foam, cut into it with a KNIFE&nbsp; across the foam so it acts as a bed for your wrist chain. Hopefully all will become clear as I progress.

If you have thought about self bondage you will have undoubtably have made yourself breathless admiring those lengths of chain they sell in Home Depot. You need TWO 8� PIECES OF CHAIN , the gap across the chain links needs to be about � inch. Hold the foam around the wrist and pull the chain as tight as you can, then lock it with LOCK 1. Carry out the same procedure on your other wrist using LOCK 2. Now is certainly a time for coffee, as you need to be sure that you have got your chains as tight as you can without cutting off your blood supply. If this happens, it will usually be felt at the base of your thumbs. 

Hope you enjoyed the coffee! Lets progress. Get a STRONG LEATHER BELT. Place the belt around your ankles and position the belt so the buckle is at the front of your feet. Obviously you cannot do the belt up as there is no hole for it. You want this belt to be as tight as you can, again without cutting off the blood supply. When you have experimented and know how tight you can stand, cut a hole in the belt to do it up so it can&#8217;t come undone. Take care: you may find you need to pull it tighter than you want to cut the hole as it releases a little when you do it up. I will leave you to experiment. Next, when your ankles are secured, use another LOCK TIE to ensure you cannot undo the belt. It will need to go from the buckle to the hole so it can&#8217;t be undone with your fingers. You will work it out. Pull it as tight as you can and cut off the excess lock tie with the secateurs.

From experience I have discovered you need a little more play at your knees, I found using 3 SPORTS SOCKS is ideal. Tie them together as tight as you can and, sitting down, tie the loose ends together tightly, placing the knots in the gaps between your knees. Don&#8217;t overtighten, as when you kneel down your muscles will bulge and tighten it naturally. Now we are getting serious, as soon you will be helpless.
Kneel on the bed. Place a 2 LITER&nbsp; BOTTLE OF WATER 1&nbsp; between your knees. The actual weight is up to you, this is the size I find best. Tie the string around the neck of the water bottle as tightly as you can. I find about 8� of string is about right, as you mustn&#8217;t be able to get your hands to it later. If you wish, now is a good time to drink as much as you can of&nbsp; BOTTLE OF WATER 2.

Take a 4 FOOT PIECE OF CHAIN. This chain must have LONG THIN LINKS, less than ��.  Place LOCK 3 on the end link of the chain. Then take 3 LOCK TIES and feed all 3 of them through lock 3 and pull tight enough to leave a circle of about 2 � diameter. Now its time to move on to the final phase, so turn off the bedside light and remove the bulb. It should now be totally dark, so you will do everything from now on by feel, and you need to be well organised. Whilst kneeling on the bed, put your hands behind your back and feed the chain up between your ankles and the belt. Pull it through until the 3 tie locks are just touching the belt.&nbsp; I am right handed, so I shall describe the next bit for right-handers, adjust as you see fit.

Feed the long chain through the larger links of your left wrist chain. Use your left hand to feed it through
 the links on your right wrist. Hold on to the 3 lock ties with your left hand, and at the same time use your left hand and right hand to pull the chain tighter through your right wrist chain. You will get the hang of it. You should be able, with some wriggling and struggle, to be able to have the long chain pulled very tight, holding both ends in your left hand. Now the clever bit. In your right hand you should have LOCK 4. You should be able to reach up and put the curved metal hook of lock 4 through one of the long chain links. When you have done that, pull it as tight as you dare and tuck the curved metal hook through the 3 lock ties that you are still holding with your left hand. Now the big moment. Turn the curved metal hook and click the lock shut. Too late to change your mind now! You are now kneeling on the bed, in the dark, with absolutely no way of getting free. If you find you have been too careful and you do not feel your hogtie is tight enough, you still have the option of pulling the 3 lock ties tighter, this will make it about 1�tighter, but remember there will be no going back if you do it!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CHAPTER 2

Well, if you have stayed the course so far, I am obviously dealing with somebody who is very keen, so welcome. You are doubtless wondering how you are going to get out of this, so lets see.

The first thing to say is that you can stay kneeling on the bed for some time if you wish, making minor adjustments (tighter only!) to your bonds. But there is a limit, because firstly you cannot get free on the bed, and secondly�. Remember that bottle of water you drank? You may wish to stay on the bed and end up kneeling or laying in your own cold piss, but probably not a good idea in a hotel. So you will need to get off and see about freeing yourself. If you struggle to the edge of the bed, on your side, as you get closer its only a matter of time until the bottle of water slides off towards the floor. Having 2 liters of water hanging from your balls will certainly encourage you to follow it to take the pressure off!
Now:&nbsp; SAFETY FIRST. THINK WHAT YOU ARE DOING. It is important that you don&#8217;t at any time roll quickly, so the water bottle swings over you too fast. This will drastically increase the pressure on your balls as it jerks to a halt and COULD HARM YOUR GROIN MUSCLES. Don&#8217;t worry, its not a huge possibility but should not be discounted nontheless.

Now its time to make your way to the bathroom before you piss on the carpet. You will find however tight you have made the bonds, you can still progress slowly to the bathroom, about 1� at a time. Of course, ever inch involves overcoming the friction and pulling the water bottle along the carpet with your balls, so you won&#8217;t forget about it. It will take about 15 mins to drag yourself to the bathroom floor, I am sure getting there before you burst will ensure maximum effort to move rather than rest. Once there, you can let the piss flow� what a relief. Now you can rest awhile. Most hotel bathrooms have a rectangular drain in the middle of the floor, lifting it earlier and placing CLINGFILM around it will slow the speed it drains away. You may well find yourself laying on your side in the dark soaked in cold piss and forced to take in the aroma.. Leaving the bathroom will be an effort as you slip and slide. You will have put a SPREAD OUT TOWEL across the door to the bathroom so it dries you slightly and doesn&#8217;t mark the carpet.

Now you can think about getting out.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CHAPTER 3


There are 3 ways of getting out of this situation.

Firstly, the easy way, but very slow. Just before you fixed the last chain, whilst kneeling in the dark, you took the KEY TO LOCK 3. Throw it towards an area you have cleared, perhaps behind a table you have placed on its side, or something, where it will lie on the floor. As soon as it gets light you will be able to find it easily, if you spend 20 minutes pulling the drapes open with your teeth. You just have to wait 5 or so hours! You may decide to go to look for it anyway, but beware! By the time you have got there you will be hot and sweaty, and you only have your lips, tongue and hands that are sensitive enough to feel it. It could end up stuck to you shoulder or something and it could get lost. Your choice.

Secondly, the harder way, but its quicker. After the last time you used the secateurs (cutting the excess of your ankle belt plastic tie) you took ALL the spare sheets, blankets (there are often some in the closet), pillowcases and towels and wrapped the secateurs securely into a pyramid in a corner of the room, before hopping back to the bed. Now you could find these in about 10 seconds if you were free, but free is what you are not. You have only your tied hands and teeth to pull the blankets and sheets clear, and each one will take a lot of hard work, and you will end up with severely aching balls. If you can get the secateurs you can cut the 3 ties by your hands. Might be worth the effort? Your choice.&nbsp; 

Thirdly, the very quick way, but dirty and humiliating. Before you started, you collected a PLASTIC FOOD TRAY about 4� by 6�, the sort that take away food often comes in. Take the KEY TO LOCK 4 , and wrap it in  CLINGFILM .&nbsp; Now, bathrooms usually have a space between the toilet and the bathtub or wall about 1 foot wide. There is often a metal pipe running along there. The food tray will usually have a slightly ridged top to it, if you make a tiny hole near this ridge you can feed a PIECE OF STRING through it and secure the tray so it can not be pulled away from its position between the toilet and the wall/ bathtub. Now, you can still reach this tray, but only with your mouth.
Earlier, you will have filled the tray with piss. Also, you will have collected one of your turds, split it open, and put the clingfilm covered key deep inside the turd.
So your quick escape key is easily available as you know exactly where it is. All you have to do is go and get it. You will need to force yourself into the space to get your mouth to it, and use you teeth to overturn the tray and tip the shitty piss all over yourself. It may be possible to get your chin or nose over the top of the turd to pull it out, if it&#8217;s a problem you may have to take it into your mouth as you back out. Then place it against the toilet bowl, or somewhere you can easily find, and spin around to get your hands on it. Just pull it apart with your fingers and help yourself to the key! Freedom.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CONCLUSION

Well, I hope the above has made some sense to you and it will encourage you to give it a try. The hardest part to get right is the wrist locks, it seems almost impossible to make it so tight it cannot come undone as you struggle, but not so tight that it cuts off the blood to your hands.
If anybody has any questions I would be delighted to hear from you, and I would love to hear of your adventures , or other good ideas. Enjoy!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; INTRODUCTION
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Since I wrote this article I have received lots of appreciative comments, I have decided to alter some of the&nbsp; account as I realise I have missed out a few points. I will also expand it a little in places. A lot of the details are of course directed towards men, this is necessarily so as that is what I know. However much of this narrative is equally applicable to women, I would be interested to hear from any females who adapt this scenario to themselves.&nbsp;&nbsp; So here it is:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CHAPTER 1


I hope you will enjoy this account of self bondage, but before I start I feel I need to explain: this is NOT a fictional story: everything you will read here is hard fact, hard earned by trial and error, over a period of several years. I have decided to post this to save others who wish to indulge themselves from having to make the same mistakes as I have. It will contain aspects of masochism and self-humiliation. 
Because this is a factual account, it will necessarily NOT contain the flowery language and imaginations that I see in most self bondage articles, it is written as clearly and simply as possible. Consequently, it may seem a little dry to the casual reader: if so, I will not be offended if you leave, this article is not aimed specifically at you.&nbsp; If I achieve my aim, anybody reading should be able to start self-bondage with some understanding of how to achieve his or her aims quickly and efficiently.

Firstly, I must set the scene: For several years I have had a job which involved spending some time away each month in nice hotels around the world, they all seem to be similar. That is, a separate bathroom with a shower and a bathtub, quite a large bedroom with a large double bed in it, and blackout style drapes behind the more attractive ones, so darkness can be achieved at any time. I appreciate that this may not fit the conditions you find yourselves in: you will have to adapt accordingly. I was in the position of having time to myself from finishing work throughout the night, often in places where jetlag would wake me up in the middle of the night, like the west coast. This scenario assumes you will start during the night, maybe 6 hours before sunrise.
Secondly, this article may appear to jump backwards and forwards in time, but it seems to me it is impossible not to, as I proceed I hope it will become clear why. Also, I am sure many of you will be interested in the equipment that you need. My intention is to place in BOLD capitals anything that you will need to collect; I hope that it will help.

OK, lets begin. Don&#8217;t forget to put the &#8216;do not disturb&#8217; sign on the door! Lock the door from the inside. Ensure that you are not expecting any family or business calls for the duration. Take a TOWEL from the bathroom and force it into the crack at the bottom of the door as hard as you can, to ensure light from the hallway is kept out, and it is not easily removed. Force something, like a small hand towel, into the hinge crack of the bathroom door to ensure it is absolutely impossible for the door to swing shut.&nbsp; Close the blackout drapes, put the bedside lamp on. If there are any other light sources that can be turned on, remove the bulbs. Turn off the television, you would be amazed at how much light that one little red dot can produce! The other problem is that, once you are tightly secured, you will do ANYTHING to get out, it&#8217;s amazing how inventive you will be! I once left that little light on, and ruined an hours preparation by simply locating the remote control and turning the T.V. on, flooding the room with light. Most hotels give you a small fridge and guess what? If you open the door a small light will come on! If you can, disconnect the light, otherwise use the box tape to seal it at the top and top of the side. Check the closets: there is often a sliding door that automatically turns on a strip light when you pull it open. Disconnect it. Also, there will&nbsp; be a fire alarm somewhere on the roof of the bedroom, with a red light that flashes occasionally. Take some BLACK STICKY TAPE, and cover it up, but don&#8217;t forget to remove it afterwards, it&#8217;s very easy to forget. You know that BROWN BOX TAPE that is used to secure big boxes? Get a roll if that and (quietly!) use it to put a seal around the other 3 cracks in the door, to keep out the light. The reason I am making such an issue of keeping it dark will become obvious later. 
So, lets just recap where we are up to: The room is sealed securely, ALL light sources have been dealt with. Nobody has cause to disturb you or miss you. There is just the bedside lamp to see by. All the equipment described in the following paragraphs has been carefully collected and organised.


&nbsp; The safety aspects are now taken care of, so lets get to work.&nbsp; Strip naked, and select a piece of soft PLASTIC FOAM PADDING. I am thinking of the stuff that is often wrapped around valuable articles to post, it tends to come in flat pieces, like bubble wrap but without the bubbles! I hope you can work out what I mean. Cut or rip a piece about 1� wide, and about 4� long. Pull your balls down the best you can, and wrap the foam around your scrotum as high as possible. You should already have prepared a large size PLASTIC LOCK TIE. Don&#8217;t buy small or cheap ones, as you will be amazed at your strength later. They must not give way. I am referring to the tie locks you often see used in gardens to tie back shrubs, or cables from your stereo. These tie locks are one way: feed the clip through until the circle created is about 3� diameter. Holding the padding with one hand, feed the lock tie over your balls and the padding and start to tighten. Soon, it should support the padding itself. Slowly tighten as much as you please, its one way so it won&#8217;t undo. Don&#8217;t overdo it. I suggest that you go and make a coffee or something whilst you wait to see if it&#8217;s too tight or not. If not, you can always click it a couple of notches tighter. You may well find that the lock tie may try to slip off the padding behind your balls: adjust accordingly. When you are happy, cut the excess lock tie off with garden SECATEURS. I have found this padding to be very important. If you don&#8217;t use it, the lock tie will cut into you, ripping out your pubic hairs and cutting deep into your scrotum, it may well result in bleeding. If that&#8217;s what you want, fine, but it&#8217;s not for me. Personally, I want the lock tie tight enough so that I am always aware of my balls. The restriction results in them rubbing against your inner thigh with every step you take, which I like. Use trial and error, the secateurs are always available to cut it off if you find you have overdone it.
When you are happy that you have found the correct tightness, take a 12� piece of STRING. Lift your balls and force the end of the string under the lock tie. However tight you have the tie, this is still possible. Tie a knot in the string to hold it in position and leave the 12� dangling between your legs. We will return to this later.

In soft furnishing shops, you will often find that they sell STRONG FOAM: you are looking for something to place around your wrists. This is really important: it is really hard to find a material that stops your wrist chains cutting in. You may be able to find some tubular foam that is used to cover pipes, this is good stuff. In tourist shops they often sell foam cup holders to keep you coffee warm. These can be adapted, just cut out the base and it should slip over your wrist. SELLOTAPE some of the earlier used packing foam around your wrists as far up as you can, as your wrist chain will be pulled that way so you need as much cushioning as possible there. You may even want to put a SOFT SOCK around your wrist as well, holding it in position with a lock tie. If you use the tubular foam, cut into it with a KNIFE&nbsp; across the foam so it acts as a bed for your wrist chain. Hopefully all will become clear as I progress. This is certainly the hardest bit to get right. It is not possible to really test how this will work in advance. It must be absolutely impossible to pull it off your hand, but at the same time not cut into your skin (unless that&#8217;s what you like).

If you have thought about self bondage you will have undoubtedly have made yourself breathless admiring those lengths of chain they sell in Home Depot. You need TWO 8� PIECES OF CHAIN , the gap across the chain links needs to be about � inch. Secure the foam around the wrist and pull the chain as tight as you can, then lock it with LOCK 1. Carry out the same procedure on your other wrist using LOCK 2. Now is certainly a time for another coffee, as you need to be sure that you have got your chains as tight as you can without cutting off your blood supply. If this happens, it will usually be felt at the base of your thumbs. 

Hope you enjoyed the coffee! Lets progress. Get a STRONG LEATHER BELT. Place the belt around your ankles and position the belt so the buckle is at the front of your feet. Obviously you cannot do the belt up as there is no hole for it. You want this belt to be as tight as you can, again without cutting off the blood supply. When you have experimented and know how tight you can stand, cut a hole in the belt to do it up so it can&#8217;t come undone. Take care: you may find you need to pull it tighter than you want when you cut the hole as it releases a little when you do it up. I will leave you to experiment. Next, when your ankles are secured, use another LOCK TIE to ensure you cannot undo the belt. It will need to go from the buckle to the hole so it can&#8217;t be undone with your fingers. Also, you don&#8217;t want the loose end of the belt flapping about. You will work it out. Pull it as tight as you can and cut off the excess lock tie with the secateurs.

From experience I have discovered you need a little more play at your knees, I found using 3 SPORTS SOCKS is ideal. Tie them together as tight as you can and, sitting down, pull your balls forward and then tie the loose ends together tightly, placing the knots in the gaps between your knees. Don&#8217;t over tighten, as when you kneel down your muscles will bulge and tighten it naturally. Now we are getting serious, as soon you will be helpless.
Kneel on the bed. Rest&nbsp; a LARGE  BOTTLE OF WATER 1&nbsp; on top of your knees. The actual weight is up to you, this is the size I find best. Tie the string from your balls around the neck of the water bottle as tightly as you can. I find about 8� of string is about right, as you mustn&#8217;t be able to get your hands to it later. If you wish, now is a good time to drink as much as you can of&nbsp; BOTTLE OF WATER 2. 
Again, it&#8217;s time to experiment in advance. I experimented by getting a large empty bottle of Coke and tying it to the string. Put some water in it and then lie on your stomach on the floor and pull yourself along with your elbows. Just keep adding water until you are happy. Don&#8217;t fill it until you can only just pull it! You have along night ahead, but it should be heavy enough that you are very aware of the tug every time you move. 

Take a 4 FOOT PIECE OF CHAIN. This chain must have LONG THIN LINKS, about �� wide.  Place LOCK 3 on the end link of the chain. Then take 3 LOCK TIES and feed all 3 of them through lock 3 and pull tight enough to leave a circle of about 3 inches in diameter. Now its time to move on to the final phase, so turn off the bedside light and remove the bulb with a cloth (its hot!). It should now be totally dark, so you will do everything from now on by feel, and you need to be well organised. Whilst kneeling on the bed, put your hands behind your back and feed the chain up between your ankles and the belt. Pull it through until the 3 tie locks are just touching the belt.&nbsp; I am right handed, so I shall describe the next bit for right-handers, adjust as you see fit.

Feed the long chain through the larger links of your left wrist chain. Use your left hand to feed it through
 the links on your right wrist. Hold on to the 3 lock ties with 3 fingers of your left hand, and at the same time use your left hand and right hand to pull the chain tighter through your right wrist chain. You will get the hang of it. You should be able, with some wriggling and struggle, to be able to have the long chain pulled very tight, holding the chain and the lock ties in your left hand. Now the clever bit. In your right hand you should be holding LOCK 4. You should be able to reach up and put the curved metal hook of lock 4 through one of the long chain links. When you have done that, pull it as tight as you dare and tuck the curved metal hook of the lock through the 3 lock ties that you are still holding with your left hand. Now the big moment. Take a deep breath, now is your last chance for second thoughts. Turn the curved metal hook and click the lock shut. Too late to change your mind now!

OK, lets just remind ourselves of where we are up to. You are now kneeling on the bed, in the dark. You will feel quite wobbly, as you are not used to kneeling with your legs so close together, also your shoulders will be pulled back firmly behind your back. You are in a classic hogtie, but still kneeling up. If you find you have been too careful and you do not feel your hogtie is tight enough, you still have the option of pulling the 3 lock ties tighter, but remember there will be no going back if you do it!
One of the advantages of the darkness now becomes obvious. Normally your senses of sight and sound dominate your other sense, limiting them. Now, your eyes are useless, there is nothing to hear except the hum of the air conditioning. So your sense of feel, smell and taste can take over. You will be aware, as you sit there, of the tightness binding your legs at your ankles and your knees. You will be aware of the cool, threatening weight of the bottle resting on the top of your knees. Your hands are at liberty to play and pull at your chains all you wish, but they will not come loose. You can reach your ankle belt, but you cannot undo it. 






&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CHAPTER 2

Well, if you have stayed the course so far, I am obviously dealing with somebody who is very keen, so welcome. You are doubtless wondering how you are going to get out of this, so lets see.

The first thing to say is that you can stay kneeling on the bed for some time if you wish, making minor adjustments (tighter only!) to your bonds. But there is a limit, because firstly you cannot get free on the bed, and secondly�. Remember that bottle of water you drank? You may wish to stay on the bed and end up kneeling or laying in your own cold piss, but probably not a good idea in a hotel. So you will need to get off and see about freeing yourself. Firstly, you will have to fall on your side. Now you will find out how tightly you are bound! Now you are not sitting, your arms and legs will strain to be apart. You will have to struggle to the edge of the bed in the pitch dark and see about getting down (you may have planned ahead and left a pillow on the floor so you cushion your landing.) As you get to the edge of the bed, on your side, as you get closer its only a matter of time until the bottle of water slides off towards the floor. Having a bottle of water hanging from your balls will certainly encourage you to follow it to take the pressure off!
Now:&nbsp; SAFETY FIRST. THINK WHAT YOU ARE DOING. It is important that you don&#8217;t at any time roll quickly, so the water bottle swings over you too fast. This will drastically increase the pressure on your balls as it jerks to a halt and COULD HARM YOUR GROIN MUSCLES. Don&#8217;t worry, its not a huge possibility but should not be discounted nonetheless.

Now, it&#8217;s time to make your way to the bathroom before you piss on the carpet. You will find however tight you have made the bonds, you can still progress slowly to the bathroom, about 1� at a time. Of course, ever inch involves overcoming the friction and pulling the water bottle along the carpet with your balls, so you won&#8217;t forget about it. It will take about 15 mins to drag yourself to the bathroom floor, I am sure getting there before you burst will ensure maximum effort to move rather than rest. It&#8217;s amazing how cold these bathroom floors feel. Once there, you can have that pee� what a relief. Now you can rest awhile. Most hotel bathrooms have a rectangular drain in the middle of the floor, lifting it earlier and placing CLINGFILM around, and packing the edges with toilet tissue will slow the speed the pee drains away. You will find yourself laying on your side in the dark, soaked in cold piss and forced to take in the aroma. Now is your first opportunity to rest, so I don&#8217;t usually rush to move out of there. In an empty corner of the bathroom I have usually placed some water. A DOG BOWL would be ideal, in case you get thirsty later. Leaving the bathroom will be an effort as you slip and slide in it. You will have put a SPREAD OUT TOWEL across the door to the bathroom so it dries you slightly and doesn&#8217;t mark the carpet.

Now you can think about getting yourself free.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CHAPTER 3


There are 3 ways of getting out of this situation.

Firstly the easy way, but very slow.
Just before you fixed the last chain, whilst kneeling in the dark, you took the KEY TO LOCK 3. Throw it towards an area you have cleared, perhaps behind a table you have placed on its side, or something, where it will lie on the floor. Try to chose an area away from the window, and away from the door. You may well try to cheat by spending 20 minutes pulling the drapes open with your teeth, in the hope that there will be enough light from outside to see the key: this will lessen the chance of that. You may also try to get the light in from under the door by pulling the towel out, so avoid the door as well. As soon as it gets light you will be able to find it easily, you just have to wait 5 or so hours! You may decide to go and hunt for it anyway, but beware! By the time you have got there you will be hot and sweaty, and you only have your lips, tongue and hands that are sensitive enough to feel it. It could end up stuck to you shoulder or something and it could get lost. Your choice.

Secondly, the harder way, but its quicker. After the last time you used the secateurs (cutting the excess of your ankle belt plastic tie) you took ALL the spare sheets, blankets (there are often some in the closet), pillowcases and towels and wrapped the secateurs securely into a pyramid in a corner of the room, before hopping back to the bed. Now you could find these in about 10 seconds if you were free, but free is what you are not. You have only your tied hands and teeth to pull the blankets and sheets clear, and you will need to cover a lot of ground to do this, searching carefully with your hands, lips and cheeks for the secateurs every time you disturb the pile. Each item will take a lot of hard work, and you will end up with a dry mouth and severely aching balls. It will take getting on for 2 hours to free yourself this way. If you can get the secateurs you can cut the 3 ties by your hands. Might be worth the effort? Your choice.&nbsp; 

Thirdly, the very quick way, but dirty and humiliating. Before you started, you collected a PLASTIC FOOD TRAY about 4� by 6�, the sort that take-away food often comes in. Take the KEY TO LOCK 4 , and wrap it in  CLINGFILM .&nbsp; Now, bathrooms usually have a space between the toilet and the bathtub or wall about 1 foot wide. There is often a metal pipe running along there. The food tray will usually have a slightly ridged top to it, if you make a tiny hole near this ridge you can feed a PIECE OF STRING through it and secure the tray so it can not be pulled away from its position between the toilet and the wall/ bathtub. Now, you can still reach this tray, if you force your way in on your stomach, but only with your mouth.
Earlier, you will have filled the tray with pee. Also, you will have collected one of your turds, split it open, and put the clingfilm covered key deep inside it. Place this in the tray also.
So your quick escape key is easily available as you know exactly where it is. All you have to do is go and get it. You will need to force yourself into the space to get your mouth to it, (not that easy as you have to cross the soaking wet floor again) and use you teeth to overturn the tray and tip the shitty piss all over yourself. It may be possible to get your chin or nose over the top of the soft turd to pull it out, if it&#8217;s a problem or it begins to disintegrate&nbsp; you may have to take it into your mouth as you shuffle&nbsp; out, biting down hard to ensure you get the key. This is hard work as you want to breath through your nose. Then place it against the toilet bowl, or somewhere you can easily find, and spin around to get your hands on it. Just pull it apart with your fingers and help yourself to the key! Freedom.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CONCLUSION

Well, I hope the above has made some sense to you and it will encourage you to give it a try. The hardest part to get right is the wrist locks, it is really hard to make it so tight it cannot come undone as you struggle, but not so tight that it cuts off the blood to your hands.
If anybody has any questions I would be delighted to hear from you, and I would love to hear of your adventures, or other good ideas. I would be interested in how girls can adapt the above. Just e-mail travelhost69@hotmail.com.&nbsp; Enjoy!
