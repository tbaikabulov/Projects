&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sassy's Forced Submission&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp; I come by my nick name honestly. My dad nicknamed me Sassy. I grew up with it, even in school it stuck. I was always mouthing off. Seemed to be my nature. Not a&nbsp; smartass just feisty. 
 I loved flirting, and sassing the guys back when they would pick on me, which was often.&nbsp; This worked well for me&nbsp; and as I got older the guys who liked me would just blow it off and&nbsp; mouth right back,&nbsp; life went on. Guys picked on me and I gave it right back. 
&nbsp;&nbsp; Eventually I took on the job of running a bar. Loved it and had the respect of all my customers.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If a fight broke out I could usually (if they were locals) could step between them and stop it cause my safety was more important to them than a fight. Afterall they couldn't fight if I was in the middle, and so it goes. 
&nbsp;&nbsp; One night a stranger came in. Nice guy,&nbsp; Average looking, tall, brown hair. Nothing really out of the ordinary as far as looks But it was the way he presented himself..He had an air about him. One of strength, masculinity, and self confidence. Yeah he got my attention,&nbsp; I wasn't a teenage ninny anymore.&nbsp; But he was totally male. You could just tell he knew who he was and what he wanted. He would get any gal's attention. More so because he was very quiet and very observant. Almost scary. 
 He watched me like a hawk. My moves, everything. He never missed anything, just sat quietly and drank his beer. Several ladies hit on him and he was pleasant but distant.&nbsp; Many asked him to dance (Had a band that night) and he respectfully declined. Seemed all he was interested in was me. Why I did not know.
&nbsp;&nbsp; To say the least he intriqued me. As the nite went on I became my usual feisty and sassy self, (of course a few beers made this more so)&nbsp; flirting, and just being me. He just watched. Once in awhile I would notice a quirk in the corner of his mouth. Obviously he was amused, but still, he said nothing. This went on for better than 2 hours. He never tried to make conversation with me, or talk to me other than ordering another beer.&nbsp; He just watched. Evidently he had overheard me mention my email address to a friend, though I didn't know it at the time. 
&nbsp; When he went to leave he laid down a 20 dollar bill for a tip. I said "Thank You Sir" and&nbsp; he looked me strait in the eye&nbsp; as he said&nbsp; "One of these days little one (with a hand firmly over mine as I reached for the 20)&nbsp;&nbsp; your mouth, and your body languge is going to get you in trouble."&nbsp; I just smirked and said,&nbsp; "Yeah, Yeah...I can handle it" He gave me an intense look with deep dark brown eyes, and raised an eyebrow saying "Little One. Remenber this. The day will come when you will be sorry you said that, and&nbsp; will find your world turned upside down.&nbsp; You have a good nite now," as he patted my hand&nbsp; with an evil grin&nbsp; he left.&nbsp; Never giving me a chance to reply. 
I cannot tell you how much that aroused me.&nbsp;&nbsp; How much this self assured stranger aroused me. As the rest of the night passed I Could not get him out of my mind, and it drove me nuts. 
&nbsp; A week or so went by and I finally began to quit thinking&nbsp; about him so much. Then I recieved an email.&nbsp; This email explained to me that I needed to read these articles and really think about them. It had links listed to numerous articles, all on the subject of sexual submission, the need to be controlled, the D/s lifestyle and so on.&nbsp; I though "Uh Uh !!, Not going to happen."&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet I was interested as to what these articles were about. Who sent them, and why were they sent to me? Who had my email address that would send me this stuff? 
So as they say curiosity killed the cat.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I read them...&nbsp; Thought about them....I found myself getting extremely aroused. Why?
 
&nbsp;&nbsp; But who was this guy? And how did he know me?&nbsp; Not to mention get my email address.&nbsp; Now this really bugged me, and aroused me just wondering about the whole scenario. But it also scared me a little. I replied to the email with a simple Who the hell are you?&nbsp;&nbsp; and What do you want?&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp; Two days later I recieved another email that just simply said&nbsp; We will talk little lady. You will come to know me well. Be patient.&nbsp; I replied with "No, you arrogant S.O.B.. I don't think we will. I don't know you and furthermore I don't want to.&nbsp;&nbsp; So, Good-Bye,and Good riddance" 
I recieved one back with a pic and the simple statement&nbsp; "Recognize me now pet"&nbsp;&nbsp; We have met, and will so again.&nbsp; Shocked I just simply thought ..The guy at the bar, and he is a Dom, I am so screwed. But then I braced up,took a deep breath and thought But so what, no big deal..So he's a Dom. Nothing I can't handle.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
 
Part 2..
I continued to get emails for the next few weeks, but all they ever contained were links to various articles about&nbsp; Dominance, submissives and the meaning of a Dom/sub relationship. What had to transpire and happen before such a relationship could or would occur. I thought Oh, this guy is nuts, and obviously does not know who he is dealing with. Yet I wondered Why do I keep reading them?.. I should just delete them but they are interesting to say the least. However, I will not give him the satisfaction of a return response No, Sireee, I will not. I looked at the email and wrote furious with him... Screw you asshole....and hit reply. 
He returned with..
Oh, you will and sooner&nbsp; than you think,&nbsp; except perhaps it&nbsp; will be the other way around. Me screwing you instead. Think about the word you used&nbsp; pet...asshole...Always watch what you say to a Dom. It might be taken literally...Your words..your actions..your body language...your eyes...NOTHING&nbsp; gets missed by a Dom. It would be to your advantage to remember that, read and learn, for you will become my pet submissive, and&nbsp; you will give yourself to me willingly..it is what you want. You just don't know it yet....BUT, YOU WILL
I was stunned. This guy really had his nerve. If I ever see him again I will certainly give him a piece of my mind...
But why couldn't I stop thinking about him? Why not just delete the damn emails and just block him..I will, that is what I will do...It's that simple.
But I didn't.&nbsp; He had captivated my attention.. my curiosity... and I don't even know how.&nbsp; And why was I so damn wet. I am not aroused by this asshole trying to manipulate me.&nbsp; Absolutely not..OR AM I? I pushed away from the computer and thought this is not at all like me.. Why am I finding this so man so arousing? The guy is a complete jerk.. I don't talk to jerks, even in the bar I avoid the few who come in, so why am I not ignoring him..It would be so easy...one button...DELETE...&nbsp; 
But I didn't hit delete instead I clicked the next link and read the article ..WHY?..Yet the more I read...the more I thought....&nbsp; and the wetter I got. The thought of a man controlling me was very arousing..I felt like my body was betraying me and everything I always believed, being that no man would ever control me. Nope, not gonna happen. 
I snickered to myself..So What,. He&nbsp; isn't going to know that... Afterall he can't read my mind...No,&nbsp; but he can read my body..But&nbsp; he can't see me over the internet.hehe!!! 
But if he ever comes back to the bar I am so screwed..Naaa, he won't.
This went on for a few more weeks the emails back and forth with links and articles to read, yet he said very little.&nbsp; I tried to put him out of my mind and concentrate on the bar and business. But my thoughts always went back to him Why?&nbsp;&nbsp; I even deleted some of the emails without looking at the links, but soon found myself retrieving them from&nbsp;&nbsp; the trash folder. 
Then it all stopped. No emails, No nothing. So then I thought,&nbsp; Good, glad the sick sadist, or Dom, or whatever the hell he is got that out of his system. Now maybe I can clear my head and get back to my real life. My real problems, such as How am I going to make the balloon payment coming due on the bar.Business has been good, but not good enough, and I was running out of time to come up with the cash needed.
But as the days passed I couldn't get him out of my mind..Everytime I thought about him and,&nbsp;&nbsp; the fact he was a Dom I would find myself aroused. When I thought about how he just watched me in the bar it made me want him. I felt my mind and body were betraying me.
But it would pass, now that he had got bored with his little game. Little did I know what was in store. 
 Part 3
So life went on. All was getting back to normal. My mind was busy with the up coming New Years Eve party which was always a big event at the bar. Live band and very busy. Lots of arrangements and orders to take care of.&nbsp; Not a word from my handsome secret admirer, and though I was secretly a little disappointed figured it was probably best. 
New Year's Eve...
&nbsp; I grabbed a beer and sliding into a booth I finally was able to relax. The extra help was tending bar and the band was in full swing. The night was well on its way. Everyone was happy and having a good time. 
&nbsp; Along toward the end of the evening I was feeling pretty relaxed and comfortable dressed in white short shorts, sheer pantyhose, a brief halter top and stilettos. I&nbsp; liked looking sexy and had the body language to play the part as well.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp; Everyone was dancing and having a great time. I thought "Hell, Why am I sitting here like a wall flower instead of having some fun myself. I went behind the bar and started flirting&nbsp; and having fun. One of my regulars from the end of the bar yelled at me "Hey Sassy, about time you joined the party. I dare ya to dance on the bar without knocking over a beer." Not being my nature to ever turn down a dare I yelled back "Your On, but not sure I can in stilettos." So, I climbed on top of the bar starting slow got my rhythm&nbsp; going. Dancing on a bar while avoiding the beer bottles is not that easy, so I was concentrating on the task at hand, as well as having fun.&nbsp; I was really starting to get&nbsp; into it and the crowd was cheering me on. I was having a great time. One of the patrons reached up and handed me a beer. I gladly took it and&nbsp; downed a big swig while turning&nbsp; to head back toward the other end and froze.........There he was at the end of the bar staring at me with a very mischievious grin, dangerous looking even.&nbsp; 
&nbsp; I tried not to show how flustered I was though I failed miserably. I quickly tried to regain my composure as the crowd cheered me on. Suddenly I was totally unfocused, unbalanced and nervous. However I refused to let him think he had gotten the best of me. Dancing on toward the end of the bar where he was with as much composure as possible I reached down and removed my heels, thinking maybe I could at least keep my balance and not fall off the bar."Sorry guys these have got to go." I replied jokingly then&nbsp; leaned over throwing them down in front of&nbsp; him and with a quirky grin replied, "Like what ya see stranger?" I turned and danced away. How dare him come into my bar and sneak up on me like that. Though in all truth he hadn't done a thing wrong. 
The crowd whooped and hollored.&nbsp; "Way to go Sassy" He never said a word, but did grin slightly. I danced a little more then jumped down and said "That's it folks, I'm done"&nbsp;  They all thanked me and I went back to a far back booth in a dark corner meant for privacy&nbsp; to regain my composure and save grace. I didn't know why he flustered me so much, but he did.&nbsp;&nbsp; I sighed and took a deep breath thinking it's a wonder&nbsp; I didn't fall on my face and make a total fool of myself in front of him as nervous as I was.
 Shortly after I saw him walking toward my booth with the air of a man who knew what he was about, and what he wanted. It wasn't arrogance, but a confidence unlike any I had ever seen. A couple of the local girls asked him for a dance and he politely declined.&nbsp; But what was it with this guy? Was he on a mission to make me a nervous wreck just cause he knew he could? 
&nbsp; With confidence he slides into the booth across from me and looks me stait in the eye  and  with a quirky self assured&nbsp; grin says. "Good evening Sassy. Nice party. You dance on the bar often? Ever do it naked? Totally shocked , I look him squarely in the eye and reply. NO, I don't,&nbsp; and&nbsp; certainly NOT naked, but I assure you, IF, I ever do I will make sure you are NOT invited."
 
He&nbsp; leans over closer to me, and answers with "Oh, I think I will because you owe me now my sweet thing, and&nbsp; thisis one debt I will thouroughly enjoy collecting.There are, shall we say&nbsp; events going on in your life that you are quite unaware of, but you soon will be. These&nbsp; events are going to change your life for the better, even though you don't know it yet, and they most certainly include me, where you like it or not.
I brace my shoulders and laugh a sarcastic "Pssssst, "I don't owe you anything you arrogant asshole. Now get out of my bar before you totally ruin my nite, and piss me off even more" He slides out of the bar and says. "As you wish&nbsp; Miss Sassy, but I will be in touch" and he calmly walked out the door.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

 Part 4
Sipping my beer and seething I think "What the hell is he talking about? I don't owe him anything. Hell, I don't even know the man. Why the hell can't he just stay out of my life, my bar and my head. I shake it off and go get another beer glad the night is almost over. Though I am thankful everything went well.&nbsp; Except for the unwanted quest it was a good night. Everyone had fun and no fights. Just as it should be. We rang in the New Year with joy and lots of confetti. Shortly after everyone said good-bye and we all went home. I pull in my drive glad to be home. I was exhausted and ready for bed. 
Hubby was out of town and I had the whole house to myself.&nbsp; Once in bed my thoughts went back to my financial situation with the bar. It was my baby and I refused to let my hubby bail me out.&nbsp; He would in a heartbeat but I wanted to do this on my own. Somehow I knew it would&nbsp; it all work out. I drifted off to sleep with those thoughts on my mind.&nbsp; 
The next day dawned bright and sunny.Looked much warmer than it actually was. I grabbed a jacket as I went out to get the mail. The wind definitely had a bite to it. Brrrrr, I mumble as I quickly grab the mail from the box and hurry back inside. Seeing one from the bank which holds the loan on the bar I quickly rip it open thinking the worst as my heart leaps into my throat. But upon reading it I think ("What the hell, reciept for balloon payment paid in full.") I search the envelope&nbsp; looking for an explanation. Nothing. Immediately I grab my cell and call the bank. I quickly get informed that a man was in yesterday and paid the payment in full. My heart jumped into my throat...NOO...Surely he didn't.&nbsp; He wouldn't&nbsp;&nbsp; But it had to be. No one else would have. Couldn't have, even if they had wanted to.&nbsp; That was what he meant by I owed him. What the hell does&nbsp; this sexier than hell man want from me? I push aside the voice in&nbsp; my head which whispers, you know your interested so just go with it. I smile thinking well, maybe a little bit interested.. 
 
I can't deny I feel as though a huge weight has been lifted having that worry off my mind. But will owing him be worse?..I wonder.&nbsp; Well only time will tell on that one I guess. I have no doubt I will find out sooner than later. And why do I get wet at just the thought of him
I glance at my watch realizing I am going to have to hustle if I am going to beat&nbsp; the beer truck to the bar..I had no idea it was so late. Sally my bar maid can open up, but she can't pay them. I quickly jump in the shower and get ready for my day. 

Out of the shower I throw on my clothes . A pair of&nbsp; pink short shorts, and a simple white tank top. On the run I grab my keys and purse and head for the bar. Pulling up to the curb I notice a jeep parked out front but pay little attention since I also see the beer delivery truck in back.&nbsp; I park the car and quickly head inside to pay the driver for the beer delivery.
 Right off I notice him at the bar chatting pleasantly with the beer truck driver.&nbsp; He would be hard to miss in a crowded bar, let alone an empty one. With a sigh I think. This is not going to be a good day Sassy. I quickly pay the driver and send him on his way.
 Exasperated&nbsp; I throw my hands in the air and turn on him. "OK, I'll bite. Why are you doing this and what do you want?  He grins. "I do believe I have already told you that. You really are going to have to learn to listen better for your own good.However, here is the abbreviated version. You now owe me. I assume you figured out your bank loan was paid?" "Yes,"&nbsp; I answered curtly." I did." He grins. "OK, So here's&nbsp; a brief overview of how things will be till your debt is repaid, and that will be determined by me and me alone.. Until it is paid in full I own you. You will do what I say, when I say, and how I say. You will ask no questios. You will call me Master or Sir. I prefer Master but would settle for Sir if you are more comfortable with that, but only for now. I will call you anything I wish. Most likely pet or little one"&nbsp; 
At this point I break out laughing. His eyes shoot daggers at me. "You find something I said funny Sassy?" Waving my hand in the air as to shuck it off I reply. "No not at all. Please continue."
&nbsp; Interupt me again Sassy and you will regret&nbsp; it. I assure you? Still laughing I reply,... "Pet, Oh come on. Surely&nbsp; you jest. You can't possibly be serious."&nbsp;&nbsp; With eyes which cut right through me he sharply answers. "I can assure you ...PET ...that I am indeed quite serious, and since it seems to amuse you so much that is exactly what I shall call you from here on PET. So get used to it." 
He raises his eyebrows and looks at me cockeyed. "Good I see I have managed to wipe that grin from your face and silence you. Now keep it that way. Now, as I was about to say before I was so rudely interupted.&nbsp;&nbsp; You have help for the bar. I have even&nbsp; hired extra help to run&nbsp; and manage it&nbsp; for you.. They are very good at what they do. So you have no need to worry. As far as your customers&nbsp; they&nbsp; think you&nbsp; are on a long much needed vacation. I am going to show you a side of your sexuality&nbsp; that you never knew excisted. But trust me it is very evident to a Dominant.&nbsp; Now, Am I understood so far, My PET?" 
Not knowing what to say, I say nothing. He sternly replies. "I require an answer, "NOW"&nbsp; I jump at the rise of his voice and&nbsp; not knowing what to say simply reply with "Yes, I think"&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes what"? he retorts sternly"&nbsp; "Yes Sir", I reply. He relaxes somewhat and leans back with a slight grin. "Good girl, that's better. See, you are learning already. Maybe now we'll get somewhere...Pet...Now on to step 2. 
I started to protest and he raised a hand to stop me. "Rule #1. Never, and I mean Never interupt me again or you will be punished.Do you understand?" I opened my mouth to speak again, and then thought better of it after seeing the stern commanding look in those bedroom brown eyes . A look that said "Don't do it." A look that said he meant business and I had best heed the warning. Finally assuming I was going to be quiet he continued. "Since I am aware&nbsp; that you have no idea about the lifestyle I am about to introduce you to we will start slow. I am the Dominant and you are the submissive.&nbsp; For now just remember&nbsp; what I say goes, and I mean every word. If I instruct you to do something you do it,&nbsp; no questions asked or you will be punished, and I will make you ask for that punishment, which I will then administer. Again, any questions?" he asks. Unable to digest everything he is saying partly due to shock, and partly due to thinking this man really has his nerve and&nbsp; mostly wondering why the hell am I even listening to him? Why haven't I just told him to get the hell out of my bar. So what if he did pay the loan. I sure as hell didn't ask him to. So far as I am concerned that is his problem. Noticing my silence he grins that snarky grin. "Does the cat have your tongue Sassy?&nbsp; Cautiously I say"No" Again I get the hard stern look. "NO what Sassy? And look at me when you answer.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His voice is demanding, full of authority&nbsp;&nbsp; "No Sir"&nbsp; I reply and quickly drop my eyes and can't help but wonder , now why the hell did I do that?&nbsp; What is this man doing to me. I feel betrayed by my body which is becoming more sexually aroused by the minute ...and I don't seem to be able to tell him no&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *He smiles*&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Perfect he thinks.......
 
Part 5.....
During all this time Sally is bustling around the bar getting ready to open for the days business when in walks a group of people. They pocess an air of confidence sense of purpose unlike any she has ever seen. Sally just stops everything and glances at me. I just shrug my shoulders and point to this man and it dawns on me .."OMG..I don't even know his name. 
Seeing the bewilderment on my face and the confusion on Sally's He speaks up with a smile as he looks in Sally's direction giving me a moments reprieve from his intensity focused on me. and says "Hi Sally, my name is Kade and this is a crew who has come to help you and Sassy for awhile with the bar. Sassy is going to be taking a much needed vacation. But I assure you and the bar that you&nbsp; both are in good hands and business will continue as normal.&nbsp; Sally just answers "OK" with a quick glance back toward me. 
I swear it is as if he knows what I am thinking.&nbsp; Regaining some of my composure and hopefully control I grin and looking at sally reply "Uh, yeah Sally he's right. I just hadn't really had a chance to fill you in yet. These guys are professional and you will be just fine" I can tell Sally isn't buying a bit of it, but for lack of knowing what to say or do,&nbsp; she just stands there&nbsp; looking dumdfounded. She can tell that I am as confused as she is.&nbsp; I feel sorry for her cause I can see the look of concern and worry on her face. So does Kade when he&nbsp; remarks "Relax Sally, Sassy is just fine. She just needs a little time off to take care of some unexpected turn of events dealing with the bar which will also turn out fine. Now if you will kindly give the new help a tour and explain how things work around here before you have to open I am sure they will be extremely grateful. Grateful for any escape she quickly answers "Yes Sir I will do thaat right now" and turns toward the new help to introduce herself and they all&nbsp; retreat to another art of the bar leaving me and Kade alone and that just scares me to death.
 Returning his attention to me he says smiling&nbsp; with confidence "Well that went well considering the confusion" I said, "Yeah, except Sally is not dumb. She knows something is not right" and&nbsp; it's not. In fact far from it she thinks to herself. I just don't know how to handle it or what to do about it. I need time to think.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Softly he says "Sassy trust me when I say you will be glad this is happening, and you will come to understand everything and why I am doing what I am doing. Even though you don't right now, you will. I know you better than you know yourself. I see things in you that you don't. I can read&nbsp;&nbsp; your body language like a book. Listen to it. It to knows what you need. Don't ignore that. Give in to it and you will be much happier." I start to protest and the softness in him vanishes like a flash, I jump at the change of tone in his voice and the stern expression on his face nd in his eyes&nbsp; "SASSY, what did I say about interupting me? It WILL NOT be tolerated EVER." Do you understand? I reply "Yes Sir. I am sorry" as I sigh and glance down again. "Good girl,"he answers with a smile"Now my pet we need to leave and take our lessons elsewhere. If you will say goodbye to Sally we will be on our way."&nbsp; I look back at him and argue&nbsp; "I can't just walk out like that. With nothing more than a goodbye I have to.....He snaps and his eyes are shooting daggers at me. Calmly but obviously angry he says "You can, and you will, NOW SASSY "&nbsp; I step back and with a "Yes Sir" I turn and go to find sally.&nbsp; Thinking, Why am I obeying him like this? What kind of a hold does this man have on me?
 I know by the tone in his voice&nbsp; to make this quick and think if nothing else at least we can take this conversation somewhere more private. Realizing what I just said I wonder why does that thought scare the hell out of me and yet thrill me at the same time.&nbsp; I am so confused I just want all of this to make sense. To understand why he arouses me so much when I should hate him. Even worse he seems to&nbsp; know my thoughts, my needs. I can see it in his eyes. But how could he?
I say my good-byes and start to head out the door where Kade is waiting by his jeep..Sally takes hold of my arm and I turn to face her. I see the look of concern on her face as she says. "Sassy are you sure everything is ok? I mean you don't even know this guy and you are just going to take off with him. Where are you going? For God's sake you need to tell someone on. something." I sigh, "Sally I will be fine. I don't know how I know that but I do.&nbsp; I am intriqued and need to find out why I am feeling some of the things I am feeling. I know he is not going to give up and I no longer think I want him to. I need to understand what is going on. What I am feeling, and only he can answer those questions.&nbsp; Looking confused and bewildered Sally says ok, but I just hope you know what you are doing. and she hugs me. With a tear in her eye, she backs away and softly says, "Just be careful, and be safe. I will miss you" Forcing a smile I say "I will. Good bye Sally. Take care of our bar" With a salute and forced smile herself she comes back with "Oh don't worry I will."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Taking a deep breath I turn and leave the bar. Outside Kade is&nbsp; leaning against&nbsp;&nbsp; the jeep with his arms crossed across his broad chest. Looking at me with a very sexy and cocky smile forming which matches the devilment in his eyes he says. "Are you ready&nbsp; my pet?" With a little huff (still not comfortable with that name) I answer "Ready as I will ever be I guess. Let's go"
&nbsp;&nbsp; I move toward the jeep where he is standing by the passenger side door. He is not budging and the smile has disappeared. "What" I retort sharply.&nbsp; Sharply he retorts " THINK SASSY" I sigh remembering "Ok, Let's go.... SIR"&nbsp; Leaning forward he gives me a sharp smack on my behind and I jump."Ouch. That hurt damn it" I squeal. With&nbsp; an evil grin he says "That tone pet will get you many&nbsp; whacks much worse than that and on a bare bottom.You had best contain it now. Next time I won't be so easy on ya. Now let's go." He moves away from the door and opening it for me motions me inside. With a frown on my face and a huff I get in. 
He starts the jeep and backs out. I can't help but notice&nbsp; just how damn sexy he is. He simply reeks of masculinity and self assurance. The scent in the jeep is all male, all him and just adds to my arousal of him.&nbsp; I sigh softly&nbsp; leaning&nbsp; my head back against the seat taking&nbsp; a deep breath and breathe in the intoxicating scent of him as I try to relax, but can't help but think. What the hell am I getting myself into?
. ......He smiles and drives thinking...........She is now his. Even though she don't know it yet.
Part 6&nbsp; 
He left her alone as he drove in silence letting the purr of the jeeps engine&nbsp; help sooth her frayed nerves.&nbsp; Hopefully putting her in a more relaxed frame of mind, and he knew she needed that.&nbsp; The next few days woud not be the easiest for her. But she had no idea the intensity of sexual pleasure she would soon experience under his control. 
&nbsp; After about 15&nbsp; I open my eyes and look around. Were on an interstate headed I have no idea where.&nbsp; I look at Kade and ask"Kade, where are we going? Looking over at me he grins that devilish grin&nbsp; I am becoming so accustonmed to. "A cabin I own in Canada. It's in the Alonquin Park area. Ever hear of it?" "No,"&nbsp; I answered. "It's a pretty place." he said. "Private, quiet and peaceful. Perfect place for a vacation."&nbsp; Grinning I say "Kade, Is that really what this is, a vacation. I mean I don't buy it. Exactly what am I going to have to do to pay&nbsp; this loan back. I need some answers, and I need them now. He answers me saying "Yes and No, Not really at sfirst. It won't be all pleasant. But in time you will think so.&nbsp; Puzzled I say "OK, then Kade please explain. What is this all about..YOU", Me, What?&nbsp; I need to know." He continues to drive. His eyes glued to the road. Hands tight on the wheel."Us, Sassy. It's about us , and what you need and want even though you don't know it yet. I can't tell you. I have to show you. And I am afraid it is not going to be easy.&nbsp; I know you don't understand now but you will.&nbsp; We will talk about it more tonight at the cabin." We have a long way to go yet. Get some rest. Trust me you will need it.
 
After several more hours of driving&nbsp; Kade&nbsp; finally arrived at the cabin. He had forgotton just how beautiful it really was here. The snow peaked mountain tops reached for the sky with glistening sparkles of sunshine. The ground was dusted with a lite coating of fresh snow, but not enough to hender getting around easily. After soaking in the beauty of the scene around&nbsp; him he glanced over at Sassy hating to wake her. 
She looks so peaceful and relaxed.&nbsp; He sighs knowing that will soon come to an end, but the pay off when he makes her see what she craves will make it all&nbsp; worth while. He just hopes she doesn't grow to hate&nbsp; him&nbsp; before she realizes just how much she has been missing.
 The freedom to just let go, block out the world around her. To let&nbsp; him lead and guide her body into those forbidden rooms of pleasure. Rooms her mind has kept locked all these years. He knows he can do that for her if she will just let&nbsp; him. 
Ultimdately it has to be her decsion. He can bust through and unlock the doors to her pleasure. But she is the one who has to&nbsp; give him the key to open them,&nbsp; and then keep them open. The one who has to allow him to stay, to guide her, direct her and&nbsp; then comfort and care for her in the aftermath. He has watched and studied&nbsp; her long enough that he&nbsp; is certain&nbsp; of her needs. Certain he&nbsp; can take her to that world of erotic pleasure.&nbsp; If she will just allow him to.&nbsp; 
&nbsp; He is not crazy about the harshness of my plan. But&nbsp; he&nbsp; feels it is the only way to open doors and bring down those barriers. The mind can be tough enemy to defeat. But if he can get into her mind. Take control and show her.Then and only then&nbsp; will she be able to see and experience&nbsp; what she is missing.&nbsp; Only then will she want to submit herself to&nbsp; him in order to keep those doors open. Taking a deep breath he sighs and&nbsp; gently shakes her "Sassy, wake up. Were here".

Part 7
I&nbsp; feel Kade shaking me.&nbsp; I wake up realizing the jeep has stopped.&nbsp; As I push myself up in the seat and look around..I take a deep breath and can't help but exclaim "OMG, Kade. This is so beautiful. Is this yours?" "Yes," he replies "You like it?"
 "Are you kidding?" she whispers barely loud enough for him to hear.What's not to like . This is the most beautiful place I have ever seen in my life.
 I smile satisfied she will&nbsp; be able to submit here. "Yes pet it is quite&nbsp; pretty. She flashes me a sarcastic look at the word pet though she says nothing, and while I get the impression she is still so not crazy about her new name she has at least accepted it. That is a start.
"Well" I remark cheerfully. Shall we go inside." She glances back toward&nbsp;&nbsp; the cabin. The wrap around front porch&nbsp; decked out with wicker furniture for a leisurly morning or afternoon when weather permits. The place looks warm, inviting.&nbsp; Homey and comfortable. A place to just curl up inside on a sofa by the fireplace with a good book&nbsp; and a hot cup of coffee on a cold winters day
 Feeling the chill settling in the jeep I gently touch Sassy's arm.. "Time to get inside pet, the chill will only get worse ."
 Snapping back to reality she answers "Ok....Can't wait to see the inside. Am sure I will love it here."
 She doesn't notice Kade's sigh as he only hopes she will feel that way in a week.
Once inside I get a tour of the place. Nice big rooms each with it's own fireplace.&nbsp; A very eloquent wet bar fullly stocked with liquors of all kinds.&nbsp; From the very expensive&nbsp; to the&nbsp; lesser quality varieties.&nbsp; Whole cabin appears to be very well decorated in rustic wood colors. 
Master bedroom is huge with complete suite of rooms shut off from the rest of the cabin done exquisitly in romantic blues and mauves.
Noticing an upstairs as well I start up the heavily carpeted stairs and feel a hand on my elbow. Looking back I see a strange expression on Kade's face. One I can't read.&nbsp; "No, pet we will explore that room later. Tonight we need to eat and go over some rules. First things first, he smiles."
"Rules" I&nbsp; remark. Looking into my eyes he softly says "Yes&nbsp; pet. There are rules. Now let's get some dinner. Down the street is a lovely little Mom and Pop restaurant."
I think to myself. This day has not turned out so bad after all.&nbsp; 
 
AND THE LESSONS BEGIN..............
After dinner Kade took my hand and led me toward the big front room. The fireplace&nbsp; was already lit and had added a nice soft glow to the&nbsp; room. It had a cozy and comforting atmosphere.One of being safe and secure. 
While there were several sofas and suttees around Kade led me to a small table in the corner. Very expensive looking made on the order of a traditional card table back home with four nicely upholstered chairs. He pulled one out and said "Take a seat Sassy. It is now time we talk business." I do and&nbsp; I can feel the hairs on the nape if my neck standing strait up. He looks so serious his eyes dark and deep in thought. He goes and sits on the sofa
"Ok sassy. The only way I know to do this is just start. For now this is like a business arrangement. However it is one which will benefit you greatly. Not only will your bar be paid off, you will become a different woman in the process."&nbsp; I start to say "Bu"..."SASSY, come here"&nbsp; Bewildered I look at him,anger showing in my eyes "Why, I snap hatefully?" 
His face changes to very determined and angry. The lines in his forehead becoming tighter and more pronounced. Then I remember. I interrupted him.."Oops!! Sorry Sir, I forgot"&nbsp; I look for his face to relax....it doesn't... "&nbsp; He points to between his legs where he is seated on the sofa, "On Knees, legs apart ...Right here. NOW SASSY !!" His brown nearly black&nbsp; now glaring at me.
 I jump at the authority in his voice. Slowly&nbsp; I walk toward him. He glares as he watches me. I stand in front between his legs as instructed. Still expressing anger he retorts sharply "On you knees"&nbsp; "Yes Sir," I reply and quickly obey&nbsp; his command as I drop to my knees in front of him.&nbsp; While his voice softens somewhat I can tell he is still angry. Silently I think he is angry and I am wet and aroused. I almost giggle at the absurdity of it. But I know better. But I have to wonder. Why Is That?"&nbsp;&nbsp; I quickly return my attention Kade. "Now, I will continue, with no more interuptions. Is that understood Cassy?" "Yes Sir." I reply and drop my eyes to the floor, though I really have no idea why I did that. It just seemed the thing to do. With her eyes dropping to the floor on her own, he smiles and softly says "Good Girl Sassy but for now I want you to look at me." Slowly I raise my eyes to look at him, not sure what to expect. "Ok Cassie, Normally you would have been punished for what you just did. You have been told not to interrupt me, have you not?" "Yes Sir" I answer. He continues looking sternly at me. " You will be punished since you have already been warned not to interupt me. You need to listen to what I have to say, and you need to listen well. I will not repeat it. Simply put. From now on you will do What I say... When I say....Where I say....and How I say...No if's, and's, or butt's. Is that&nbsp; Clear?" "Yes Sir," I quietly answer, though not happy about it. I keep that thought to myself, although he looks at me questioningly as though he knows what I am thinking. But he can't possibly know how turned on I am. Can he?
Kade leans back and crosses his arms casually over his chest. He&nbsp;&nbsp; looks up at her smiling. "Now I want you to stand up and strip."
 I stand then laugh&nbsp; throwing my hands up in the air "Oh Kade this is ridiculous. You can't possibly be serious." 
But the expressions on his face assures me he is.&nbsp; In a flash he jumps up grabs my wrists and pushes me backwards into the wall pinning me up against it. "What did I just say pet? I am not playing games here Sassy. I mean what I say and the sooner you accept that the better this will go. I assure you I can make it as rough, or as easy as you want. But&nbsp; you WILL do as I say. I am in control, not you. ...Now Strip !! 
He releases me to see if I am going to do it. Seeing the fury in his eyes I do as he says. Slowly with tears starting to form I start to unbutton my blouse. He stands rigid in front of me never wavering as he watches me. Having unbuttoned it all the way I pause to go any further.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
"Continue Cassie. You don't want me to do it for you." Slowly I reach up and slide it off my shoulders letting it fall to the floor. I then reach behind me and unhook the clasp on my bra. But I hold onto it and hesitate to look at Kade. He looks me in the eye and softly says "Just let it go Sassy. That's all you have to do. Don't think about it. Don't analyze it. Just drop it. Give it to me. This is what I am going to teach you. Your body is beautiful and should not be hidden" 
At that I bring it forward and drop it exposing my breasts to Kade. Full with rock hard nipples I feel embarrassed, vulnerable and exposed.&nbsp; I blush knowing they are a giveaway of my arousal. 
He smiles "Good Girl Sassy. Now continue."&nbsp; I smile slightly not understanding why&nbsp; I am aroused. Only knowing that&nbsp; I am.&nbsp; I know&nbsp; I am blushing.&nbsp; I can feel it in my face. But there is nothing&nbsp; I can do about it. 
Reaching forward&nbsp; I reache for the button on my shorts and undo it without even hesitating. Slowly looking at Kade&nbsp; I pushe them down over&nbsp; my hips leaving&nbsp; my bikini underwear. Bending down&nbsp; I step out of them and stand back up dropping&nbsp; my arms to&nbsp; my sides.&nbsp; I look at Kade hoping that is all he will make her do. 
 Sternly Kade looks at me. "All of it Sassy, Now" With a deep sigh&nbsp; I place a hand on each side of&nbsp; myr hips. Starting to push them down&nbsp; I hesitate. "I'm sorry Kade I can't. I just can't do this" 
Kade stiffens up. "Sassy, either you do it now or I do. You DO NOT want me to. You have about 10 sec. to decide which it is going to be." Starting to cry&nbsp; I reach for them again and proceed all at once to push them to the floor. 
Rapidly, and angry now, I brace up and&nbsp;&nbsp; step out of them&nbsp;&nbsp; kicking them out of the way. "There, you happy? Like what you see you Dominant asshole? Kade grins as his eyes travel up and down her beautiful and well cared for body. A body that would arouse any man. Bringing his eyes back up to meet her&nbsp; teary eyed ones he replies softly "Yes Sassy. As a matter of fact I like it very much. Now come here."
 Slowly&nbsp;&nbsp; walk toward him. He steps forward and wraps his arms around&nbsp; me pulling&nbsp; me into him. My sobs let go and I bury my face in his chest hiding it. He pulls me in tighter. Then with&nbsp; his hand he tilts my chin up till our mouths meet and kisses me deep and hard I am overwhelmed and taken by surprise. He releases me then and gazes deep into my eyes. "Good Girl Sassy. You did well. That will be all for tonight." With that he reaches behind him bringing forward a very&nbsp; soft and comforting robe which had been lying on a table close by and wraps it gently around me.&nbsp;&nbsp; I step back and&nbsp; pull it together in the front bringing&nbsp; my eyes back up to meet his. He reaches up cupping my chin lightly. "Just remember Sassy all you have to do is just do what I say and you will get through this, and I promise you it will be worth it" He points toward a room and tells her. "You may go."You have your own private bath and suit. It's your's, it's private and it's set up for you.I won't bother you in there. Go,relax and enjoy it, and I will see you in the morning. If you need anything just hollar."&nbsp; 
 
I turn quickly walking away. Once inside the door to my bedroom I turn my head back with a quick glance at Kade to find him smiling, just watching me.&nbsp; All signs of anger gone only to be&nbsp; replaced now with lines of worry and fatique. Still angry though I quickly turn back toward&nbsp; the room Kade set up for me thinking who cares how he feels anyway. The jerk. I sure as hell don't.... Do I?
 I slam the door shut behind me relieved to finally have some privacy and take in my surroundings. Big king four poster bed complete with Rustic western style comforter and matching woodsy print curtains. 
Dressing table is rustic also complete with toiletries and all the extras. Brushes, hair clips, almost anything a girl could want to primp.Shows how well he knows me. I don't primp as she shrugs her shoulders and heads for the bathrom to run a bath. 
Once ready&nbsp; I drop the robe and slowly step into the big round tub sinking lower as&nbsp; I go till&nbsp; I am submerged into the warm soothing water. 
Spotting some&nbsp; lavender bath beads I reach for them and add some to the water. Taking a deep breath I&nbsp; let my head slowly fall&nbsp; back and rest against the tubs wall.&nbsp; I drink in the&nbsp; wonderful scent of lavender. I&nbsp; draw each breath deeply into my lungs, then let it out slowly as I try to&nbsp; relax and let the day dissolve away into the bath water. Leaving&nbsp; my mind free and clear of all worries. At least for the moment. Being somewhat relaxed&nbsp; I finish&nbsp; my bath and stepping out with a thick rose colored towel in hand I start to dry off. My eyes travel to the bed and suddenly&nbsp; I realize how exhausted I am.&nbsp; Climbing into bed I'm ready to put the day behind me. Mentally exhausted I quickly fall into a deep sleep.
Kade steps over to the bar and pours himself a shot of Jim Beam. Just what he needs to end this day. He sighs deeply. The day went pretty well all considered. It certainly could have been worse. but then there is always tomorrow.&nbsp; He knows Sassy is submissive, but convincing her of that is not going to be&nbsp; easy. He knows to that he is going to have to be rough on her to get her to understand. She is so strong willed she will not even try to give it a chance. Even though he loves&nbsp; to take control, and will have control. He&nbsp; wants her to enjoy it as well. To see that is submissive and to understand what that means.
With a big sigh he rinses his glass then sets it in the sink and heads for bed hoping tomorrow won't be the disaster he is afraid it will. 
 I wake to the smell of bacon wafting into&nbsp; my room. Suddenly I am aware that I am starved. Quickly I get up and grab a pair of jeans and a shirt and head for the kitchen. 
Hearing me enter the room kade turns around from the stove. "Morning Sassy. How did you sleep?" "Fine" I reply. "Good,&nbsp; hope your hungry. I've got eggs, and bacon with biscuits and gravy. have a seat as he motions to a chair.&nbsp; As I&nbsp; seat myself he quickly sets a plate in front of me filled with 2 eggs, 4 slices bacon, and 2 biscuits and gravy. "Kade" I reply "This looks wonderfull but&nbsp; I can't eat all of this"
Turning around he looks me in the eyes. "Sure you can Sassy and you will. Your going to need your energy." Looking at him defiantly i remark. "I beg your pardon. I think I am old enough to know what I need or don't need as far as food or anything else goes."&nbsp; Calmly he walks over to me anger showing on his face once again. I look up and remember.
"Sir," I emphasize "I am sorry, But I will not eat all of this." Reaching up he grabs a handful of my hair and pulls my head back forcing me to look up at him. "Fine,"&nbsp; he says calmly. "Then we shall continue with todays lessons. After that remark and telling&nbsp; me&nbsp; NO you will have no breakfast. Consider that your punishment" 
 He releases my head letting it fall back to a natural position. He then picks up my plate and scrapes the contents into the trash dropping the plate in the sink of soapy water. Walking back over to me I stiffen scared of what he is going to do next.
He doesn't touch me but in a voice that I know means business he calmly say "Get up Sassy and follow me"&nbsp; I know by his tone not to question him so I just do as instucted.&nbsp; 
He walks toward the stairs and the mystery room that was off limits last night. For some strange reason like a bad omen I&nbsp; no this&nbsp; is not going to be good. Reaching the door to the room he retrieves a key from his pocket. He then proceeds to unlock the door with a glance back in my direction like he thought I might bolt or something and he would have to chase&nbsp; me down. Inside the room was beautiful done in mauve's and lavenders. Rich vibrant shades which complimented each other. But on one end of the room was a wall done totally in oak with hooks supporting all kinds of whips and boxes. All various shapes and sizes. I had no idea what the boxes contained and was not about to ask. Kade stood watching me take it all in. Not saying a word.
 I knew I wasn't going to like this even though I had no idea what he was up to. I look at him questioningly. "Kade what is this all about?" I ask. "Just come on in Sassy and close the door." "Why," I ask.&nbsp; With authority he raises his voice " JUST DO IT, and don't make me tell you again" I know from his look and his voice not to push him so I proceed to do as he commands, closing the door softly behind me.
Going to a lounge chair in the corner Kade sits with his ankle crossing his knee and arms crossed across his chest. "Now Sassy without any rebuttal I want you to strip for me right where you are.&nbsp; . Do I make myself clear?" I nod my head yes. "When I ask you a question I expect a verbal answer. No nods."
"Yes Sir," I reply, though a bit shaky sounding. "Good Girl Sassy. Now proceed as instructed. Slowly I start removing my clothing. I start with my blouse slowly undoing one button at a time. 
His eyes are on me, intense, taking in every move I make. I feel as though my body is betraying me, for my nipples are rock hard, why? At the same time I realize my mound is wet also, to the point&nbsp; that my cream has soaked through my panties making them uncomfortable.
 As I continue having now slid my blouse off my shoulders and allowing it to drop I notice Kade's eyes have softened. He appears less tense. Reaching down I unbutton my&nbsp; jeans and slowly (having to wiggle my hips, they are so tight) push them&nbsp; down over my ass to the floor. Stepping out of them&nbsp; I push them aside with my foot, I feel a rush of embarrassment, and wetness. 
I push my panties down to my ankles. I am blushing cause I know he can see the wetness in them. Stepping out of them I bring my arms back to my sides and look to Kade for further instuction. I am so embarrassed by my arousal. I even imagine him fingering me. 
"Very good pet.We are going to try something I think you will like very much, but you have to trust me? I want you to close your eyes and&nbsp; take 5 min to think about it. Don't think about anything else. Clear your mind. I just want you to think Do I trust him?&nbsp; This is very important Sassy. If you don't I want to know, but you won't be in trouble or make me mad. But it has to be an honest answer. Everything depends on your honesty and it will determine where we go from her. Now close your eyes and think.
Doing as he says I close my eyes and try to think. Do I really trust him? What happens if Isay no. Do we stop? Do I want to stop, or do I want to continue. But damn if he ain't about the sexiest man I have ever laid eyes on as I think mentally picturing him sitting in the chair drinking in the site of my naked body. I have never been so aroused as I am by that thought&nbsp; As if he is absorbing my body through his eyes. Ok, so. trust. I mean what is not to trust. He's not going to kill me for pity sakes. Lost in my thoughts of him, suddenly his voice brings me back to reality. 
Ok, Sassy times up. Now I will ask you again, and I expect an answer this time, and look into my eyes when you do.&nbsp; Do you trust me?&nbsp; Meekly I answer, "Yes Sir," I do. then drop my eyes again, though I am not sure why&nbsp; He smiles, "Good, look at me Sassy." I raise my eyes again and look at him.&nbsp; "That means totally, no matter what I ask you to do. Can you do that?"&nbsp; Taking a deep breath I say "Yes, Yes Sir I do."&nbsp; Smiling still he&nbsp; replies. "Good pet, then we shall continue. I will expect no resistance or hesitation from now on. If it is something you absolutely do not like and you want me to stop use the safewords. But if you do everything ceases. Do you understand?"Softly I say "Yes Sir, I do." 
 He rises from the chair and walks toward me. His body posture and&nbsp; masculine stride demonstrating his authority. Standing in front of me now his look is serious, his eyes so intent. He tips my chin up to look at him "Sassy, What are&nbsp; your safewords?"&nbsp;&nbsp; Eye to eye now I say "Green is good, Yellow is back off, Red is stop everything." With a look of being pleased he says "You are doing very well my pet. I am proud of you." I reply "Thank you Sir,I am pleased that you are." and I really was. Thinking I don't understand why all of a sudden it seems so important to me to please him, but it does.
 He turns then and walks over to a strait back chair against the wall. Sitting with legs together he pats his lap. "Sassy, Come here and lay across my lap." I walk towards him and do as instructed.&nbsp; My face reddens as&nbsp; I am embarrassed that I am across his lap with my naked ass exposed fully to him. 
Not to mention he is bound to notice how wet my pussy is. Gently I feel his hands on the cheeks of my ass. He starts caressing and rubbing them. Then&nbsp; squeezing them, his nails digging&nbsp;&nbsp; lightly into my flesh. The pressure slowly increases as he&nbsp; squeezes harder and faster. God what is he doing to me. This&nbsp; is making me so hot.I can feel my juices increasing with each squeeze.&nbsp; 
Then he removes a hand, and almost immediately brings it back down on my right cheek hard. I flinch as I feel the sting, not expecting the hard blow, then rapidly again on the left cheek, each time his hand lands harder on my ass. He continues for 10 more hard swats.I cry out from the pain. Tears in my eyes I feel the fire in my ass. "What's you color Sassy?" I open my mouth to say yellow but for some unknown reason I answer with&nbsp; "Green Sir"&nbsp; "Good girl" 
The sharp sting was worse with each blow, and the&nbsp; proof that it hurt showed in my eyes as the tears welled up. I was sure my ass had to be&nbsp; rose colored at the very least. Yet I was so aroused. So wet I knew I was leaking my juices all over Kade's&nbsp; lap. Afraid I was going to cum right then. I did not understand what was happening. As if knowing what I was thinking Kade replied roughly, "Don't cum Sassy. You cannot cum til I give you permission. Do you understand?" "Yes Sir," I said. "Good girl Sassy." at which point he goes back to lightly caressing and rubbing my sore and reddened ass. My arousal begins to ease off, making it easier for me to refrain from cumming. Yet still wanting to so badly I can hardly stand it as I squirm on Kade's lap. 
At that moment I flinch as I feel Kade's fingers slide into my wet pussy. Then probe deeper as I squirm. "Hmm," Kade Whispers, "I think my pet has enjoyed her spanking. "Is that right pet?"&nbsp; "Yes Sir," I whisper.&nbsp; Though I have no idea why. Having me thouroughly wet and dripping he withdraws his fingers and replaces them with a small vibrator which keeps my pussy on high alert. Lightly he draws a finger upward toward the rosebud opening of my ass.&nbsp;&nbsp; Then circles his finger around and around it.&nbsp; Teasing and caressing it.&nbsp; He feels&nbsp; my body stiffen at his touch of&nbsp; my virgin hole.&nbsp; "Relax pet. You will enjoy this to. Just relax and give in to it."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "NO," I exclaim,"I will not,"&nbsp; I yelp.&nbsp; "Sassy, You will give me your ass and take it. Work with it. Relax and feel it. Feel what it is doing to you. Your arousal"&nbsp;&nbsp; Realizing&nbsp; what he has in mind of doing.I refuse to listen to him.&nbsp; I yell "I hate you, Stop it." 
 At that instant he pushes his finger in and slowly invades my opening. I squirm as he slowly goes deeper. "Nooo,"&nbsp; I moan. "Please Sir, I do not want this.It hurts" and I find myself starting to cry. Kade whispers, "Feel it, Sassy.&nbsp; Feel the vibe in your pussy. My fingers in your ass. Let the pain combine with the pleasure. Block out everything else. He continues the vibe in my pussy, his fingers in my ass. My wetness has covered his knee. The pain in my ass starts to join with the pleasure in my pussy quickly becoming one erotic sensation. My squirms are now squirms of pleasure. My crying now moans of erotic pleasure. I moan and squirm "Stop, please Sir."
Kade grins wickedly as my ass squirms on his lap. "That does not sound very convincing my pet. In fact I would swear that is a moan of being very aroused. He then inserts a second finger into my ass as well, making it tighter. I squirm more and moan. He continues probing in my ass. While the vibe works on my pussy. Working and twisting his fingers inside me. While there is pain, it is an erotic pain.&nbsp; I can no longer distinquish which is pleasure and which is pain. They have become one and the same. 
Embarrassed and shocked I soon realize I am going to cum. With all these new feelings and sensations exploding in my body I am quickly pushed over the edge and&nbsp; release my orgasm explosively on Kade's lap. He allows me to relax, and come down from my orgasm, while he gently rubs and massages my ass.
Once having calmed down&nbsp;&nbsp; I jump up without warning. Turning to face him I am furious. "Damn it Kade, I told you to stop, and you didn't. Your supposed to stop if it is to much for me, or hurts me,&nbsp; or I don't like it. Now I can't trust you. And further more I hate you." I stop ranting and sink to the floor, suddenly exhausted. He just looks at me. 
After a few minutes he says "Sassy, Look at me," I raise my tear stained face and look at him. He continues. "First of all. "Stop" is not a safeword now is it?"&nbsp; "No," I answer. "It is not."&nbsp; Second, "I did not hurt you. Did you not enjoy it after a bit? And don't even try to lie to me Sassy. I have evidence of your orgasm all over me."&nbsp; I can't help but grin and blush "Yes Sir, I did."&nbsp; ""Hmm," He grins. "You did what Sassy?"
I drop my eyes to the floor. "I enjoyed it Sir"&nbsp;&nbsp; More serious now he says. "Look at me Sassy," Raising my eyes, still somewhat&nbsp; watery from the tears I look up at him. "Now, Can I assume that your ass will no longer be a problem?"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Bu.." I start to interupt&nbsp;&nbsp; "SASSY. Do you want more right now? He looks at me raising an eybrow expecting an answer&nbsp; "No Sir, It will no longer be a problem." 
He relaxes.."Good Girl. Now, Understand that I will never hurt you. Really&nbsp; hurting you would hurt me much more than you. 
 But I will push your limits, and remember,&nbsp; nothing will make me stop pushing those limits except your safeword, which is not stop. Understood."&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes Sir, I answer."&nbsp; "Now tell me Sassy. Was that not a good orgasm?"&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes Sir," I answer&nbsp; "It was." 
Still sitting on the floor he rises and comes over to stand over me. He looks threatening, and oh so sexy. He reaches down and takes my chin tilting it upward. Forcing me to look at him."Have you forgotten anything during this little exercise Sassy."
 My mind a jumble of thoughts and emotions I cannot think. So not knowing what to say, I&nbsp; whimper truthfully. with my head down "I don't know, Sir, I can't even think right now"
 He answers That is a good and honest answer, and I believe you. However, pay attention and look at me. Sighing I look up at him.
Towering over me he smiles. 
"1.You forgot to call me Sir when you were yelling at me. 
"2. Never, ever yell at me again. I assure you, you will regret it. 
"3.You forgot to ask if you could cum. "And,
 4. Never, ever tell me no again in that tone of voice. Understood
Quietly I answer "Yes Sir,&nbsp; I understand. 
He reaches down and extends his hand to help me up. I look up and see him smile at me. "I think you have had enough for now, and we both need a shower. I will decide your punishment later. I am willing to let all of them slide this time, except for one. "Do, You know which one that is Sassy."&nbsp; I try to think. Which would he think most important. "Not calling you Sir," I answer reluctantly. "No Sassy," he replies. "While that is important. I am willing to let it slide this time only. 
But I will not allow you to cum without permission. Your orgasms are Mine. I own them. I choose when you have them, how you have them and where you have them, and for that you will be punished. You will also be punished for interupting me for the second time after being warned. So you have two punishments coming. 
But not now, tomorrow will be soon enough and he pulls me close to him. Kissing the top of my head. He whispers in my ear.&nbsp; "My sweet pet. You&nbsp; still hate me?" Calmer now, I snuggle close into him feeling cared for, safe, protected even. Softly I replied "No Sir, I never did really. Was just mad."&nbsp; Kade smiles...and unoticed to me, gives a small sigh of relief
"Now my pet, we enjoy the pleasure of&nbsp; taking a shower together" and he leads me toward the very spacious and inviting bath room..














Part 2

Kade leads me toward the very spacious and inviting bath room. Once inside he heads toward the shower and notices my eyes on the big sunken walk in tub in the corner. With a smile he turns toward it, then taking my chin tips it up to meet his eyes. "Would my pet prefer the tub?" "Looks pretty inviting Sir." I respond. Smiling he kisses me on the forehead. "Then you shall have your wish pet." 

He releases me to prepare the bath and while it is filling he slowly proceeds to undress, never taking his eyes from me. 

I can't help but admire his masculine physic. The taut muscles as they ripple with his movements of undress. His toned and lean body movements silently portray the ability to please a woman sexually for hours on end if so desired.

His well impressive 8 inch cock stands erect and ready as he watches me in my state of nakedness standing obediently before him awaiting further instructions. 

Once undressed he takes my hand and gently coaxes me into the tub leading me as he steps down. As my feet reach the warmth of the hot water it sends shivers of warmth up my spine.

Kade pulls me to him and gently wraps his arms around me pulling me close. With one arm around my shoulders he slips his other arm behind my knees and picks me up effortlessly. Slowly looking into my eyes he lowers us both into the water and settles on the tubs floor with me on his lap.

He turns me to where my back is against his chest and softly whispers. "Lay your head back against my chest, close your eyes and just relax your body pet. Clear your mind of everything except what you are feeling." I start to speak and touches my lips with his finger. "Shhh, not a word pet" 

Then I feel his strong hand which reddened my ass just an hour ago gentle and soothing . Lightly he runs it up and down my right thigh holding a soapy lufah. Then my left thigh. Next is my belly. He totally by passes my womanhood. Then up to my breasts and hardened nipples. 

With my eyes closed I feel the warm soapy water caress my skin ever so lightly. The water sluices over my breasts, then trickles down to my belly. Then further down and seeping into my clit and between my wet pussy pussy lips. I feel the warmth of it soothing and caressing my clit. 

About that time I feel Kade's fingers on my clit. With small light circles he rubs and caresses. His thumb paying special attention to that hard little nubin which drives me wild. He smiles as he notices how it is throbbing and craving his attention. He then allows two of his fingers to gently slide into my house of please. They work their magic exploring my pussy and on my clit turning my arousal into moans of pleasure as he starts to work faster. 

He reaches around and takes a nipple between his fingers. Without warning he pinches it lightly at first, then harder. I hear him whisper. ""My pet is becoming very aroused and wet, isn't she?" "Yes Sir," I moan softly." He pinches my niplple harder and and his magical fingers inside my pussy become more aggressive as he explores deeper and more vigorously..

I become so aroused I cannot believe I am allowing him to do this to me. Even though I know I have no choice. I also know I would not stop him if I could. The sensations I am having are new to me, more intense and sensual than any I have ever experienced. He then grabs my other breast and starts massaging it in his big hand, gently but firmly then with his thumb and forefinger takes that nipple between his fingers and pinches it same as he did the other. driving me even closer to an orgasm. He whispers, "Remember your instructions pet. Be careful and do not make another mistake lost in your arousal. Even though you are to the point of feeling nothing but the pleasure you are experiencing you have to learn control, To wait and hold back as needed. 

I hear him whispering to me, I hear what he is saying, but I am so close to cumming I am thinking of nothing else but the pleasure I am experiencing. The need for it to continue as the fire in my body which has betrayed me rages and my senses climb to an all time high. Right on the edge I wait for it. Crave it ..............

Then he stops everything. Frustrated I lash out. "Why did you quit. Don't stop now," Sharply he growls, "I give the orders pet, and don't ever forget that." You were going to cum, were you not?" He smacks my thigh hard turning it red , leaving evidence of his hand print behind. "Yes Sir." I answer softly... "Hmm, I see, and what would have been wrong with that my pet?" I thought for a minute frustrated and unsatisfied, then remembered. ""I forgot to ask Sir," I replied carefully. "Yes," he answered, and that would have warranted you yet another punishment on your growing list. So actually I did you a favor by stopping and you may Thank me for it," I whisper softly. "Thank You Sir," In my ear again he says "For what pet. Tell me?" For not letting me cum and making another mistake Sir." 
" Good girl, he answers. 

With a soft and pleasing voice now he continues, " Now my sweet, we need to finish you bath," I feel the soapy warm water run down my back as he uses the lufah in small circles. He then turns me around to face him and ask me grinning.

"You trust me right pet?" Somewhat nervous I reply "Yes, Sir" "Good" he chuckles and suddenly plunges me under the water. I gasp and soon as I do he raises me back up. Laughing he answers "I had to get your hair wet to shampoo my sweet little slut's hair. He squeezes shampoo on my head and works it into my hair. Massaging my head I can't help but notice his erection. 
-
I reach over and lightly run my finger up the length of his shaft, slow and teasingly. He whispers softly grinning, not now pet but soon" I continue teasing and caressing his hardness ignoring him until He takes his fingers and reaching down between my legs grabs the lips of my clit tightly pinching and pulling on them. With a gasp I reply "Owww," and try to move away to no avail. Only making him pinch and pull harder

Then looking in my eyes he says, "Little one, two can play that little game and I guarantee you I will come out the winner. I look right back at you and say "Well Sir, just maybe I will let you to win. You don't get to call all the shots?" 

Grinning wickedly and with a low voice, " Pet this bath just ended, and without warning he pushed me back under the water to rinse my hair of the soap. Bringing me back up he stood up pulling me up with him. Stepping out of the tub he grabs a towel and quickly dries me off first, then himself, instructing me not to move in a gruff voice as he lets go my arm. 

Once finished drying he dresses quickly and taking my hands proceeds to lead me out of the room. I stop at the door and he turns to look at me. "Yes," he remarks. "Is something wrong?" Sarcastically I add. "A little thing called my clothes Sir." He chuckles and nods his head saying, "Your not going to need them pet. I start to protest and he stops me. 

"Pet, when are you going to learn the more you defy me, the worse it will be for you. Your stubborn, cute, sexy as hell and tough. But get it through your head. You are no match for me and you never will be.I will always win try as hard as you might. Remember this also. Every time you defy me is one more punishment added to your list. 

Your ass, mind soul and body are Mine while we are here. I will control, use, take and do whatever I desire with it. Is that understood?" 

I look at you and being my smart self answer "Hmph!! so much for useless safewords. What happened to them? They just fly out the freaking window, or do they only apply when you wish them to...Sir? 

Suddenly you let go my hand and step in so close I can feel your breath warm on my cheek.. You grab my chin firmly tilting it upward looking me strait in the eye. Your eyes are dark, possessive and speak volumes. You grin is wicked and menacing. Your voice low. Pet you are going to wish you had never said that.

Standing back you fold your arms across your chest and stand there looking at me. "You just keep adding it on sweetness. Now, you remember that room you saw last night at the top of the stairs?" I nod yes. "Pet, I asked you a question. A nod is not an answer,nor will it ever be accepted as one. 

Now answer me like your supposed to, or do you wish to dig your grave a little deeper. If so I will wait? I look strait into your dark eyes and answer "Yes Sir," I do.

Your grin widens and your eyes sparkle with menace. "Well my sweet pet. You are about to experience it first hand." 

Looking in your eyes I ask showing a slight fear . "Sir, you arn't going to hurt me are you? You hesitate before answering then step back giving me some personal space . You then answer quietly, and soberly, "Yes pet, probably, but I will also teach you how to deal with it, and use it for pleasure, as well as being a lesson to not cross me as you have been doing. The pain will serve two purposes. For this defiance is going to stop. I will break you of your disobedience, and you will learn to submit to me, and further more you will want to submit. 

"You are a brat, albeit a cute one," as you grin slightly "but a brat never the less. I understand it is a part of who you are and I do not wish to change that. 

However my cute sweet pet YOU WILL learn to control it with me, or I will definitely and quickly become your worst nightmare. Your ass will need cushions to sit that cute ass on for a very very long time. 

You might also well remember that I have many ways of controlling a bratty sub. Ways that are far, far worse than anything I am sure you could ever imagine. Now, the room, shall we go my sweet?" and you extend your hand to me as the wicked smile returns fully. 

I slip my hand into yours taking it nervousy but knowing I have no choice, and although I allow you to lead me my mind races with possible ways of escape, though quickly come to the conclusion that there are none. For now anyway I realize I am at his mercy and I know it. For the first time ever in my life I realize I have lost all control, and it scares me to death, yet at the same tie excites me tremendously. I am now at his mercy like it or not, which I definitely do not, yet......Why do feel all this moistness in my pussy? Why does my fear of him and my situation harden my nipples, and just seem to make me wetter? 

It is like my mind is saying no, and I hate this man, yet my body is yielding to him and why would it? Makes no sense. He stops returning my thoughts to the present, and I find we are standing in front of the door to this secret room. 

He turns and looks at me grinning, placing his hand on the knob. "Are you ready pet,?" Having no alternative I answer meekly, as I never have before in my life. "Yes Sir" and he slowly opens the door.
 
THE ROOM:
I step inside and gasp at the overall magnificence of the room and it's size. The expert way the colors all blend and compliment each other in greens, blues and reds. Deep soft carpet so thick my feet sink in it.&nbsp; Forest green in color and obviously very expensive. 
Then my eyes slowly begin to scan&nbsp; and explore the contents of&nbsp; the room more thoroughly. Beginning with the huge floor to ceiling windows on 3 sides of the room, covered by rich red burgundy drapes heavy enough to keep out any and all light if necesary. Again very expensive. The room was spared no expense in decorating and was obviously done by&nbsp; a professional. 
The thought struck me that whatever Kade wanted money was no object. If he wanted, it he had it, and at this time what he appeared to want was me, and he made no bones about the fact that at least for now he owned me. End of discussion. No was not an answer he was used to hearing, or accepting,&nbsp; making my situation seem much more grave. 
Returning my thoughts to the decor, I look up against the far back wall and notice there is a massive bed.&nbsp; Bigger than the normal king size. But very soft and comfy looking stacked with big fluffy soft pillows and a rich looking comforter all done in burgundy. Though I could not help but notice what looked like handcuffs tucked in attached pockets just off each corner of the bed. I refused to dwell on what they might be used for, and why.
Kade stands quietly watching me&nbsp; adjust to the room and it's contents. Taking my eyes away from the bed they move left,&nbsp; to the wall furthest away and find it covered in ropes and pulleys of all sorts. As well as what appears to be various types of whips and paddles. My body shivers as I suddenly feel a chill as cold as a north wind go creep chillingly up my spine.
Scanning the room more quickly now my eyes stop on the far right wall spotting two large dressers. Then shelving with boxes stacked neatly in rows each one having easy access. There are benches of some sort which are similar to a sawhorse except for being a bit wider and padded with a raised center like a camels hump on some. There is some sort of a cross in a corner and I shudder to even imagine what it is used for. I turn to look at Kade and see him standing there with arms crossed across his chest, legs braced and slightly apart just watching me. 
He smiles and says. We will be spending many hours in this room from now on my pet. There will be times you will hate me. Times you will love me, and last but not least&nbsp; times you will not know how you feel about me, or you. Your body and mind will tell you two different things. Listen to your body. It will not betray you. But if you will trust me. I will turn your world around with pleasures you have never even dreamed possible, an in the end you will thank me. 
Most of all remember what I say goes. I give you a command you do it, no questions asked and no hesitation. If what I am doing is absolutely to much you have your safe word. That is the only word which will stop me, Understood?&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes Sir," I reply humbly. If you refuse to obey a command you will be punished. You do not want my punishments trust me. I will not tolerate any type of disobedience ever or at any time, no matter how simple it may seem to you. Is that understood Pet? I look at you and reply "Yes Sir," it is. 
My thoughts are so mixed up. I am scared and fear Kade and this room, yet in my mind I know I can trust him. I feel that deep in my soul.&nbsp;&nbsp; I am so aroused, wet and excited. Lost in my thoughts of my confusion I hear kade's voice and jump at the&nbsp; severe tone that it echoes in the room. I look at him quickly and see him standing there looking more powerful and domineering than ever. A frown creasing his forehead. His eyes dark and stern looking squarely at me he commands me "Sassy. go to that cross over there in the corner," I answer softly "Yes Sir," and proceed in that direction. Once there I look at it as though it is a monster going to eat me. It scares me to death and I can't even imagine what he has planned for me. I assume he is going to have me bound to it and that thought scares me even more. I feel my eyes start to water as my pussy gets still wetter, What is wrong with me I wonder. How can I be so aroused when I am so scared. Yet in my mind I think. He has not hurt me yet. Not really, except my pride. Scared me yes. Intimidate me, absolutely,&nbsp; but hurt me, No. I try to relax and do as he instructs. I will concentrate on what he tells me. I have to trust him. I have no choice. I take a deep breath as I gather my courage and watch him walk slowly and confidently toward me and I back up as he draws nearer till I feel the cross behind me and stop. Reaching me he smiles wickedly "Good pet, right where I want you. We shall begin a lesson in obedience right now. But trust me when I say you will also enjoy it.&nbsp; 
Swiftly he grabs my&nbsp; wrists&nbsp; and raises my arms above my head. Only then do I notice the hooks on the cross and as he grabs cuffs from a box to the side. Quickly and effortlessly he cuffs my left&nbsp; wrist, hooks&nbsp; it to the left side of the cross with a short&nbsp; clasp link above my head, then does the right side the same way. He notices my breathing quicken and my body become tense. But say nothing as he continues to work. He then takes a leather strap and binds my waist to the center of the cross. Holding me snug. He steps forward and grinning whispers in my ear. "Spread your legs wide for me pet," while at the same time he nibbles my ear, then backs off again. I am so wet I know he notices my arousal. He knows what he is doing to me. To my senses. My nipples are hard as rocks and he reaches up and pinches them lightly. My body flinches at his touch, then quivers with desire. I am so embarrassed as I&nbsp; watch him looking at me. Observing me. 
He then reaches into a box again and brings out two more cuffs for my ankles. Just as he did with my wrists he attaches one ankle to each side of the cross my legs being spread wide and leaving me vulnerable, open and exposed. 
I realize I am snugly bound to this cross, not going anywhere till he releases me. I am at his mercy for whatever he wishes to do&nbsp; to me. My eyes well up with tears as he stands back to look at me,&nbsp; arms crossed over his chest,&nbsp; legs slightly apart and he smiles wickedly. My tears having no affect on him.&nbsp; 
He then walks over to the far wall and takes a flogger down from a hook. Walking back toward me he swings it slightly back and forth and flicking it against his thigh smiling. He walks up to me and leans into my ear.&nbsp; "Where's the brat now Sassy, hmm?&nbsp; Not so brave now is she?"&nbsp; 
"No,"&nbsp; I respond quietly. He takes the flogger and lightly drags the tails up the outside of my thigh, then up my side and across my breasts. teasing my hardened nipples, with the ends. As he starts down the other side of my body with the tails of the flogger he reaches up with his other hand and quickly pinches my nipples, first one then the other. The flogger trails down my other side, then he drags it slowly up the inside of my thigh, teasing and tickling it, switching over to the other side and doing the same to it. He then&nbsp; stands back and with a flick of the wrist&nbsp; flicks the ends up and across my sensitive&nbsp; clit. I gasp,&nbsp; as I feel it rapidly kiss my clit lightly creating&nbsp; a slight sting to my wet mound. Smiling wickedly&nbsp; he repeats the same action again,&nbsp; and yet again,&nbsp; as I gasp&nbsp; each time the floggers tails flick my clit and pussy lips lightly. 
He then stands back and watches me breathing deeply as my body quivers slightly.&nbsp; I watch him raise it to the air and bring it down across my shoulders, first one side then the other, though not as hard as I had feared. I realize then it is only adding to my arousal. He then without hesitation does the other side down across my shoulders. He continues bringing the flogger down across my body in various places and ways slowly adding more strength to his strikes till my arousal is at it's peak. He walks up to me and whispers "You can't cum pet"&nbsp; 
Then steps back again and raises the flogger high coming down across my breasts harder than before leaving red streaks, I cry out, yet he continues again,&nbsp; across my thighs, then again. Leaving my thighs streaked with red marks. I feel the sting and burning sensation of pain course through me with each contact the flogger makes to my sensitive skin&nbsp; 
My breathing becomes rapid and I am gasping with each strike to my body when he steps up to me. "What's your color pet?"&nbsp; Breathlessly I whisper,&nbsp; "Green Sir,"&nbsp; though I have no idea why I did not say red.
 "Good pet, we shall continue then," and he steps back once more. This time I see him&nbsp; twist the flogger in his hand and holding it lower&nbsp; now and under handed&nbsp; he quickly flicks his wrist and brings it up to land on my clit and pussy lips, whack !! . Then again,&nbsp; whack!! whack!! and whack!! . I cry out with a scream as each time it lands is harder than the time before, My pussy is throbbing, burning and stinging from the floggers strikes. My whole body feels as though it is on fire from where the flogger has touched me, and caressed me painfully. 
I hear Kades voice, softly talking to me.&nbsp; "Sassy use the pain, relax, let it work for you. Turn it to pleasure and absorb it into your body as one with the pleasure you are feeling, the arousal. Let your mind take over. Think of nothing but how your pleasing me and how the pain and pleasure are becoming one intense sensation
 I then realize I can no longer distinguish between the pain and pleasure as the flogger continues to kiss my body, first one place then the other, but always coming back to my pussy and bringing it to life making it throb and pulse even more, each time the flogger connects with it. 
The feelings become so intense my mind is in a fog of pleasure, the pain has been transformed to a feeling euphoric pleasure unlike any I have never experienced before.&nbsp; Feelings so intense I cannot explain them. 
Kades voice sounds far away and muffled. My mind is in another place, a safe, erotic zone where nothing but pleasurable feelings exist. Nothing else matters. My mind floats lost in these feelings 
 Then I hear him in my ear whisper&nbsp; " Now you may cum my pet."&nbsp; Hearing those words as I feel another strike to my pussy harder than the previous I cum with more intensity than I ever have in my life. Wave after wave of orgasmic spasms wash over me. My body quivers I feel totally spent and relaxed,&nbsp; Hardly even aware of where I am. But knowing I have had a series of orgasms better than anything I have ever experienced in my life. 
I then vaquely feel my legs being unclamped and then my waist. I&nbsp; feel my wrists being unbound, and then collapsing into Kades arms as the second one is freed and&nbsp; he quickly catches me. 
He walks over to the big bed and lays me down gently. He leaves but soon returns and i feel him rubbing my breasts and thighs with some sort of cool soothing oil. He massages me gently from head to toe as my mind starts to leave the protective fog it was surrounded in,&nbsp; and return to normal. His hands feeling firm yet gentle and comforting on my sore skin. 
I open my eyes to see him watching me and smiling. "Welcome back pet." he whispers softly. "How was your first trip to subspace my dear?"&nbsp;&nbsp; "To my what?"&nbsp; I reply.&nbsp; 
He chuckles low and whispers. "Just close your eyes and rest little one for now. You will understand it&nbsp; all soon enough my pet."&nbsp; I close my eyes again and just let my mind enjoy his hands as they skillfully continue massaging my soreness till I drift off to sleep exhausted...The last words I hear are Kade&#8217;s voice whisper,&nbsp; �My precious sassy little princess you were simply made to submit.�
