Riordan and Elise 

&quot;I would
like a woman to love me,&quot; Riordan mused, between sips of his drink. His
friends could tell by the glaze in his eyes that he was tipsy. It didn't stop
them from pouring him more wine. 

&quot;You've
taken them all to bed,&quot; Andrew said, stoically, &quot;and they aren't
impressed.&quot; 

Riordan only looked into his cup and
sloshed the fluid around a little. &quot;I'm tired of women.&quot; 

&quot;Perhaps you
should try men,&quot; Ernest suggested, slyly nudging at his young companion,
who blushed a deep red. 

Riordan said
nothing as the banter continued and the talk about sex and lust expanded into a
verbal orgy. He put his cup down, leaned into the couch and closed his eyes.
Despite the terrible loneliness that pressed into his chest, he felt
comfortable�even content�around his friends and their garbled speech. He let
himself fall into a light sleep as words buzzed around him. 

When he woke up,
the crowd had cleared and only Andrew sat in the couch across from him. 

&quot;So you're
finally up?&quot; Andrew reached across the space between the couches to pat
Riordan on the knee, &quot;There's a good fellow.&quot; 

Riordan shifted,
&quot;Where is everyone?&quot; 

&quot;It's almost
daybreak, everyone's in bed.&quot; 

&quot;Daybreak?&quot; 

Riordan jumped up,
and then grasped his head as dull pain closed over it. &quot;I have business to
attend to!&quot; 

Andrew just
laughed. 

&quot;Where is my
horse? Get my horse, boy!&quot; He sprung up again, and grabbed his doublet
which he had taken off earlier because of the heat, &quot;Go make ready!&quot; 

When Andrew did
not move, Riordan marched towards him, and cuffed his ear. &quot;Get my horse,
boy,&quot; he said angrily, &quot;Unless you want to feel my whip.&quot; 

Suddenly Andrew's
face was serious. &quot;Sir, you have no business today, it is Sunday.&quot; 

Realization poured
over Riordan's face, and he slumped back down into the couch. &quot;Is it
Sunday, boy?&quot; 

&quot;Aye, sir, it
is .&quot; 

&quot;I'm
sorry.&quot; 

For a while they
sat in the awkward silence, then at length Andrew spoke, &quot;Shall I get you
breakfast, sir?&quot; 

&quot;Please.&quot;


Riordan watched
the boy leave the room and knew he loved him. 

*** 

It was Riordan's
birthday and he was alone. His horse was climbing up the hills of Gabel Manor
at a hearty canter, and he could feel the flush rise to his cheeks. His
nostrils flared with the scent of ripe flowers on the air, and his eyes
devoured the pinks and oranges that strayed from the rising sun and diffused
through the sky. As he drew the reins back and his horse came to a halt, he
thought of Andrew and he missed his company. 

Andrew had been
away for the night, entertaining the company of some young girl he fancied.
Unlike his master, he preferred to court girls, and was slow, if not reluctant
to take them to bed. It was this one fact that gave Riordan hope. 

When he approached
the doors of Gabel Manor, Andrew was waiting outside; engaging in conversation
with the hostler. Beside the tired old man, Andrew's
youth and charm were even more apparent. His skin was flawless and creamy, and
he wore a haphazard smile on his face. &quot;Good morning, Master,&quot; he
greeted jovially as he caught the reins that Riordan tossed to him. 

&quot;Back later
than usual,&quot; Riordan commented as he dismounted, &quot;Your young
honeysuckle must be very dry by now.&quot; 

Andrew blushed and
the hostler smiled knowingly as he led the horse away
and let the master and servant speak. A breeze came and swept Andrew's dark
curls over his milk white skin. He seemed like an angel to Riordan, and master
could not help but pat the younger boy on his arm, &quot;I only tease,
lad.&quot; 

&quot;I know
sir.&quot; 

&quot;You missed a
splendid morning ride,&quot; Riordan told Andrew, &quot;You should have seen
the morning delicacies,&quot; he paused, &quot;but you were no doubt gobbling
up your own treats.&quot; 

Andrew shifted
away, &quot;Jealousy does not become you, sir.&quot; 

Riordan raised his
voice, &quot;Jealousy?&quot; 

&quot;Aye sir, a
master ought not to be jealous of his servant.&quot; 

&quot;I most
certainly am not!&quot; 

&quot;Please don't
deny it Riordan, I know you too well.&quot; 

Despite their
friendship, Andrew rarely called his master by his name. This time, it made
Riordan stop in his tracks. 

&quot;You don't
know me at all.&quot; 

&quot;I know your
mind, sir.&quot; 

&quot;You do not
know�&quot; and before he could even finish his sentence, he could feel his
hand gaining momentum as it passed through the air and hit Andrew squarely on
his cheek. 

The boy stepped
back. &quot;Sir�&quot; 

&quot;Andrew!&quot;
Riordan looked back at his hand, and his palm was red. Grief washed over him as
he ran to his servant. &quot;My boy, I'm so sorry, I�&quot; but even as he
reached out for Andrew's arm, the boy backed away. &quot;Don't walk away from
me Andrew, I am your master, and don't you forget it.&quot; 

&quot;Sir, I am
not frightened of you. I just don't feel the same way.&quot; 

And at this
Riordan's heart broke. He was almost too frightened to ask, &quot;Feel the same
way about what?&quot; 

&quot;I know you
are not proud of me for my lack of activity with women. I know you want me to
be like you, and I�&quot; his eyes were cast down, and his cheeks were red,
&quot;I admire you sir, and respect you but the womankind are too fragile, and
too delicate for me to break. I can not�&quot; 

&quot;I'm not
upset that you don't want to fuck women Andrew, and if you are fucking them, I'm
not jealous that you are.&quot; 

&quot;I know sir,
you're jealous because I have someone that loves me and you do not.&quot; 

A pang of deep and
agonizing pain ripped through Riordan's chest, and he clutched briefly at his
heart as he staggered forward. &quot;You're in love?&quot; 

&quot;I am
sir.&quot; 

&quot;I should
have known, my boy, a good master ought to have known.&quot; 

&quot;It isn't
your fault, I was discreet. I am sorry I upset you, lordship, and perhaps this
is not the appropriate time but,&quot; he paused, and looked up at the taller
man, &quot;I am asking permission to marry her, lordship.&quot; 

You may take
your little whore and run away, Riordan thought,
but even as the phrase came to mind, it disappeared. &quot;I would like to make
her acquaintance and know her family, and then, lad, we will together decide.&quot;


&quot;Sir, I know
that my heart belongs to her.&quot; 

&quot;I don't
doubt you, I just wish to know if her heart is in the right place and
her dowry is suitable.&quot; 

&quot;She will
please you.&quot; 

Riordan smiled. He
thought about the virginal bride, and how he would fuck her and break her for
his revenge, but when he looked back at Andrew and the little birthmark on his
chin, and the light in his eyes, he knew he could not hurt him, &quot;This is
only a formality, Andrew, my boy, I want you to be
happy.&quot; 

They walked
through the manor's halls in silence. It was his birthday, and instead of
offering him a present, Andrew had taken all that Riordan had and crushed it in
his blind, love-stricken path. 

*** 

The list of
friends, companions and acquaintances that attended Riordan's birthday feast
was nothing short of spectacular. The familiar faces from drinking parties
migrated close to their friend, making sure that his cup was never empty. Some
men brought their women along; though very few of their consorts were actually
their wives. Most were mistresses and lovers: young girls, who he would have
thought as children, if it weren't for the coquettish smiles wrapped around
their baby faces. He knew his friends too well; they were rich and loved to
dress their pretty whores in scarves and silk blouses, and in the attire of
young, flat-chested maidens. 

����������� Among
the chatter in the parlor, he felt alone. He searched
the room for Andrew but his loneliness only spread when he saw the young boy
talking closely with a petite brunette girl. She must be his honeysuckle he
thought. He elbowed through the crowd, murmuring haphazard responses at the
greetings and shouts thrown at him, until he came to the corner where his valet
and his lover stood. 

����������� &quot;Good
evening, my lad, and my lady.&quot; 

����������� Both
snapped out of their daze and turned towards him abruptly. He was surprised at
how beautiful the girl really was. Her light hair clung around her head in
imperfect ringlets, framing a truly warm face. Her eyes were light brown and
her smile was instant and caring. 

����������� &quot;Good
evening, lordship!&quot; she exclaimed, and curtsied, &quot;I wish you many
happy returns.&quot; 

����������� Andrew
and his girl were a beautiful couple�an angel boy and a pixie. Riordan could
see the mischief beaming out from under her eyes, and the joy in her lips. 

����������� You
must be Andrew's whore, he tested in his mind. He
wanted to hate her, but her eyes were just as beautiful as her lover's.
&quot;I've heard of you, but I don't know your name, Miss.&quot; 

����������� &quot;Heard
of me?&quot; she looked at Andrew from the corner of her eye and squeezed his
hand, &quot;I hope in good favour.&quot; 

����������� &quot;Nothing but the best.&quot; 

����������� Andrew
smiled, &quot;Master, allow me to present Miss. Laurette
Harbinger. Miss. Harbinger, as you know, this is the famous Lord Riordan Abergale.&quot; 

����������� &quot;Aye,
I do sir. Perhaps one day, I shall come to live in your home.&quot; 

����������� &quot;You
are quite forward, young Miss. Harbinger, I am not found of
mischief-makers,&quot; but Riordan's tone was teasing. 

����������� &quot;Oh,
then how is it that you can tolerate my dear Andrew?&quot; 

����������� The
three of them laughed, but Riordan's stomach was clenching. He was surrounded
by beautiful women. He was so close to Andrew, and yet they were worlds away.
Even as they spoke Andrew's eyes were on Laurette's,
and the only time they skimmed over to Riordan was to see if he approved. And
how could he not approve? Andrew was the most beautiful when he was happy. He
was no solemn angel but a cherub that brought brightness to a room when he
smiled. As much as he wanted to, he could not hurt his Andrew. He could not
hurt this Laurette whom Andrew loved so much. 

����������� Yet,
at the end of the conversation, Riordan's stomach was in knots and bile kept
rising to his throat. He washed it down with shots of brandy, as he made his
way through to familiar faces. Ernest met him halfway through the crowd and
squeezed him arm, ������ &quot;Riordan!&quot;


����������� He
turned on his heel. &quot;Ernest? Is that you?&quot; 

����������� &quot;Too
drunk to recognize your dear friend?&quot; 

����������� Riordan
blinked a number of times, until the multiple figures blended into one blurry
shape. &quot;Ernest,&quot; 

����������� &quot;Have
you found a woman yet?&quot; 

����������� &quot;I
just want someone to love me. I want a Laurette�&quot;


����������� But
to Ernest, the murmur was slurred and unrecognizable, &quot;Riordan, old chap,
when the crowd clears, the boys and I have the surprise of a lifetime for
you.&quot; 

����������� &quot;A Laurette?&quot; 

����������� &quot;We
can play roulette if that's what you want, old fellow. It is your birthday,
after all,&quot; and Ernest lifted his glass and shouted, &quot;For here's a
jolly good fellow!&quot; The room was in an uproar as voices poured into his
ears from every which direction and hands with cups and chalices shot up into
the air. They were celebrating him, and hailing him, but never before had he
felt so sick and lonely. 

*** 

����������� Riordan
was sick twice that evening, and by the time the crowds had cleared, and an
intimate group of friends had gathered, he was incredibly dizzy and tired. 

&quot;I want to sleep,&quot; he told them,
but no one paid him any heed. They were all whispering very loudly about a big
surprise. He didn't really care; his head kept flopping back and all he wanted
to do was lie down, but each time he tried to, men would drag him to his feet
and shake him. Someone tossed water all over his face. 

����������� Riordan
tried to punch his attacker but missed and fell on the floor. When he opened
his eyes to see who was trying to pick him up, he saw Andrew on one arm and ���������� Laurette on
the other. &quot;Sir,&quot; Laurette said softly,
&quot;You need some cold air, it isn't good to sleep.&quot; 

����������� &quot;Whaddya mean it's not good to sleep, you been slepping with my Andrew, here, hav'n't
ya?&quot; 

����������� She
blushed and moved away as Andrew pulled his Master up. &quot;Let's go for a
walk.&quot; 

����������� &quot;Git yer hands off of me you
traitor,&quot; he slurred, pulling his arm from Andrew's touch, &quot;and git that slut away from me.&quot; 

����������� &quot;He's
too drunk,&quot; Andrew offered apologetically, &quot;He needs to cool
down.&quot; 

&quot;I don't needa
cool down, you the one that's been fucking her.&quot; 

����������� &quot;Andrew!&quot;
Laurette's voice was edged with panic. 

����������� &quot;Yeh, I'm not a fool, this lad, eres
been telling me how you part your legs for him. He's been sucking that honeysickle clean, that's my boy, Andrew.&quot; 

����������� Laurette was stunned. The men in the room gathered round as
the drunken bumbling continued. 

����������� &quot;And
what a pretty little whore,&quot; one man commented, as he patted her bottom.
She squirmed and moved away. 

����������� &quot;A
slut in an angel�s body,&quot; another man added as he brushed his hand over her
breast. 

����������� Andrew
jumped in between them and pushed them away. &quot;If you idiots don't stop
right now, I'll�I'll&quot; but he was too upset to finish. 

����������� When
another man approached Laurette, Andrew's fist sailed
into his stomach. Protectively, he lunged towards Laurette,
and pulled her towards to him. Almost instantly, she broke away from his grasp.


����������� &quot;I
can't believe you're spreading spiteful stories about me,&quot; she whispered
loudly, tears burning in her eyes. 

����������� &quot;No,
Laurette, I would never�&quot; 

����������� &quot;I
heard it with my own ears,&quot; Riordan jumped in, &quot;how he opens your
thighs and takes a good drink�&quot; 

����������� And
with that Laurette burst into sobs and ran from the
room, pushing away at men who tried to touch her as she went. Andrew glanced at
his master furiously, and even through the blurriness, Riordan could see the
repulsion in his eyes. Then, he ran after Laurette,
leaving Riordan alone in a circle of equally drunk men. 

����������� &quot;Why
is Andrew mad?&quot; Riordan asked. 

����������� &quot;Because
you said his lover is a whore.&quot; 

����������� &quot;Who
said that?&quot; 

����������� &quot;You
did.&quot; 

����������� &quot;I
did?&quot; 

����������� And
then Riordan began laughing. He laughed so hard that he keeled over on the
floor. Doubled over, he shook until his guffaws became huge racking sobs. 

***

����������� When
Riordan woke up the next morning, his head throbbed madly. Groaning, he turned
in his bed and stretched. He thought he heard sobbing, and he forced his
eyelids open, though they tried desperately to stick together. When his vision
finally cleared, he saw two wide, gray eyes full of
panic. He screamed and scrambled out of bed. 

����������� &quot;Who
are you? Get out of my bed! GET OUT!&quot; 

����������� He
watched her face distort as she tried to get out of the bed, and ending up
rolling off and falling to a heap on the ground. She must have been drinking
too, he decided. He couldn't remember anything from the night before, he
couldn't remember meeting her or what he had done with her, but he suddenly
felt dirty. &quot;GET OUT!&quot; he screamed again, but each time she tried to get up,
she kept falling down. 

����������� Furious,
he stomped over to her, and yanked her arm up. As he jerked her up, he saw that
her wrists and ankles were manacled. His grip eased immediately when he saw
them. What had he done? He tried desperately to remember to remember who
she was but no memories came. He tried to pry the cuffs of her wrist, before realizing
he needed a key. He didn't know where he would find one. 

����������� She
was shaking her head and crying. 

����������� &quot;Who
are you? What happened last night?&quot; 

����������� She
opened her mouth, but only sobs spilled out. He turned sharply on his heel and
pulled the bell for Andrew, then he threw his door
open and yelled down the corridor for the boy. 

����������� Despite
the events of the prior night, Andrew came almost instantly. &quot;What is the
matter, sir?&quot; he asked, grasping Riordan's arm when he saw the panic in
his master's eyes. &quot;Master, master!&quot; Andrew
shouted, as he shook Riordan, and forced him to look into his eyes, &quot;What
is the matter?&quot; 

����������� &quot;I
have done something terrible Andrew, I have raped a girl. Help me, please, help
me.&quot; 

����������� Andrew's
eyes widened. &quot;Is she in there?&quot; 

����������� Riordan
only nodded, and the boy pushed passed his master and entered his bedroom. A
girl in a thin nightgown was standing beside the bed; she was looking down at
the floor, her dark hair clinging to her face, and her breasts heaving as she
cried. Although he did not recognize her, Andrew felt for her. Her fragility
reminded him so much of Laurette, and his first
instinct was to cover her. Quickly, he pulled off his overcoat and drew it
across her shoulders. At his touch, she looked up. 

����������� &quot;Are
you cold Madam?&quot; 

����������� She
nodded. 

����������� &quot;I'm
not here to hurt you. My master was drinking last night; he does not remember
what happened,&quot; his voice was soft and coaxing, &quot;can you tell me what
happened?&quot; He took her hands and gently examined the cuffs, then glanced
around the room. There were some keys on the small writing desk in the corner.
He tried them in the hole, and was relieved when the cuffs slid from her
wrists. He unlocked the manacles on her ankles, then
led her to the divan by the window, so that she could sit. He knelt do in front
of her. &quot;Can you tell me what happened, Madam?&quot; 

����������� &quot;He
did not touch me.&quot; 

����������� He
breathed a sigh of relief. &quot;I am glad of it.&quot; 

����������� At
that minute the door flew open and a dishevelled Ernest burst in. &quot;Morning
my lad,&quot; he greeted jovially as he pulled Andrew up by the arm, &quot;I
see you've found the surprise. A word alone, Andrew.&quot;


����������� Andrew
gave the girl a look and stepped aside with Ernest. &quot;What have you done
now, Ernest?&quot; 

����������� &quot;Your
master wants a bit of loving, and so we got him this lovely piece of
work.&quot; He tilted his head in the girl's direction, &quot;She's a beauty,
isn't she.&quot; 

����������� Andrew's
jaw dropped. &quot;You brought Riordan a whore?&quot; 

����������� &quot;Better,&quot;
Ernest said, grinning, &quot;a slave.&quot; 

����������� &quot;A slave?&quot; 

����������� &quot;Close
your mouth little one,&quot; Ernest said teasingly, &quot;It wasn't illegal. We
bought her from a perfectly beautiful little island where slave trade still
proliferates.&quot; 

����������� &quot;It
is illegal, Ernest! How could
you?&quot; 

����������� &quot;He
needs something he can own!&quot; 

����������� &quot;She
is a woman, not property. You cannot own a person.&quot; 

����������� &quot;Bullshit,
your owned by him, aren't your Andrew? Now she is too. Don't be jealous there
is enough space in Riordan's bed for two bedmates.&quot;


����������� Red
blushed into Andrew�s pale cheeks, and he turned quickly on his heel.

����������� �Now,
now, Andrew, be careful,� Ernest said, �You may disapprove of me as much as you
please, but I am still your better. Don�t you dare turn your back to me.�

����������� Andrew
stood still for a moment, contemplating turning around and bowing to the old
fool to appease him. Instead, he walked to the girl, ignoring Ernest�s slew of
brash vulgarities. 

����������� �If
you�ll come with me, Madam,� he whispered kindly, �I will take you away from
these madmen.�

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

����������� Andrew
put her in a small room in the attic. The east wing�s bedrooms were usually
empty but because they were currently occupied by the sick and hung-over guests
of the previous night, he thought it would be safer to stow her away from
sight. He put her in a dingy attic room, with its dramatically sloped ceiling
and the limited light from a small dormer window.

����������� �I
do not mean to make you a prisoner,� he told her kindly, �but there are morons
about the house, and it will not do to have them bothering you. Rest here
today, and I will find you a more comfortable place tomorrow. Make yourself
comfortable.�

����������� She
had gotten steadier on her feet, but her legs were still stiff from being
chained for so long. She staggered over to the bed and sat down unsteadily.

����������� Andrew
started a fire in the stone hearth. �Now, I�m sure you�ll want some sleep, so
have some rest and I�ll bring a tray for you.�

����������� She
nodded and smiled weakly. �Thank you,� she whispered.

����������� He
smiled back, �What is your name Madam?�

����������� �Andrine.� 

����������� Andrew
bowed to her. �Have a good rest Miss. Andrine,� he
said with a nod, and left the room, closing the door behind him.

����������� Andrew
stormed back to Riordan�s bedroom, where Riordan was now sitting on his bed,
looking pallid and unhappy. Ernest was at the desk�he looked like he was in the
middle of a story from the way he was laughing and gesturing. As soon as Andrew
entered, Ernest shot up, and scowled.

����������� �So
you no longer knock?� he shouted angrily, and walked towards Andrew.

����������� �Don�t
touch him,� Riordan ordered quietly. 

����������� Ernest
turned towards Riordan, �My dear lord Riordan, if I had such an insolent boy in
my house, I would box his ears! This young one needs a good whipping.�

����������� �My
dear lord Ernest,� Riordan said softly, �I would sooner kneel under your whip
then deliver this innocent boy to you. Now, sir,� he bowed deeply to Ernest, �Will
you let my boy and I alone?�

����������� Ernest
shook his head. �You forgot your friends too quickly, Riordan.� But he left
anyway.

����������� Andrew
shut the door.

����������� �Thank
you Andrew,� Riordan said. His voice changed, and it began to quaver, as he
plopped down onto the bed, �for taking care of the girl, and for��

����������� But
Andrew raised his hand abruptly, and his master fell silent.

����������� �Sir,
I have made a choice. I am leaving this house, and renouncing your protection.�

����������� Riordan
opened his lips, but Andrew kept speaking.

����������� �Laurette has gone away to the mountains. Her mother wishes
her to marry another within the week, and I am certain she will obey.�

����������� Riordan�s
face fell into his hands and he began to weep. What had he done? He knew he had done something terrible last
night, but he couldn�t fully remember. 

����������� �Do
not cry, my lord,� Andrew said coldly, �It is I who has lost my love, not you.�

����������� Riordan
wept more bitterly now. How little you
know, Andrew, he thought. I have made us both loose that, which we treasure
most deeply. 

����������� When
Riordan did not lift his head, Andrew sighed and knelt before him and took his
hands, so he was forced to free his face and look into Andrew�s eyes. Riordan
looked into Andrew�s dark pupils, set in his dark irises, and instead of compassion
he saw Andrew�s pity. Suddenly anger rose to his throat.

����������� ��I will not let you leave Andrew. If you go,
it will not be with one of my horses, or any of my coins in your purse.
Remember, my boy, even the clothes on your back belong to me. You are nothing
without me.� 

����������� �Sir,
make no mistake, you have been very kind to me over the years,� and Andrew�s
voice became patient, and understanding�as if he had expected this response
from his master, �You have fed and clothed me and educated me, but I am nothing
without Laurette, and I must go. I am not leaving
because I am angry with you but I must find her.�

����������� �Go
then!� Riordan shouted, �But go into the world, naked and poor and hungry.
Leave my house as you came to it, many years ago!� He rose abruptly and knocked
Andrew down as he did. He remembered
years ago when a housemaid had brought to him a little boy in soiled rags, and
he himself had been a boy, who had just lost his parents and inherited a
household. And he himself had been frightened, and unhappy, and overwhelmed by
the world�but he nodded to the maid, and took the pariah in and tried to treat
Andrew the way his father had treated him. And now, that stupid, wretched
boy had forgotten every good deed Riordan had done, for a stupid, wretched
woman. It made his blood boil.

����������� Andrew
picked himself up now. He was shaking, but he clenched his fists and bowed
deeply to Riordan. The politeness in his actions, and his voice were strained, �Thank
you sir, for your kindness over the years, but now, I must leave.� 

����������� Riordan
grabbed the boy�s arm, and his grip was iron. �I am not jesting Andrew, if you
leave, you leave with nothing.�

����������� �I
understand, sir,� and he pulled from Riordan�s grip and tried to edge towards
the door.

����������� �You
are a thief then,� Riordan said, �Take off these clothes, these are mine. You
have nothing in your name.�

����������� �Sir,
I assure you I will not take them with me.�

����������� �Strip!� Riordan demanded, rage rushing through his veins, and in a moment of anger grabbed Andrew�s sleeve and
tore it off the shirt.

����������� Andrew
looked at him astounded, but he was wanted more than anything to leave. He
unbuttoned the rest of his shirt, and folded what remained of it and placed it
on the floor. He then unbuttoned his boots and removed them. He slipped out of
his breeches, so that he was simply in his underthings,
and he stood before Riordan shivering. He made a move to leave, but Riordan
grabbed him again.

����������� �EVERYTHING!� Riordan demanded.

����������� �Sir,�
now Andrew�s voice was wavering, �surely, you will not make me suffer the
indignity.�

����������� But
Riordan�s eyes were now piercing, and unforgiving, and ashamedly, Andrew
removed his undergarments and stood undressed before his master. His face had
reddened, and his hands hung awkwardly about him, as if he was embarrassed, but
didn�t know how to protect himself. 

����������� Riordan
looked at him, and suddenly all the blood drained from his brain, and to
another part of himself. He could feel himself becoming very hard, and his
heart was pumping furiously. He put his hands around Andrew�s neck and when
Andrew�s expression warped from humility to fear, he pulled the boy�s ear
towards his lips. �Don�t leave me Andrew,� but there was no anger left, only
tenderness, and vulnerability. 

����������� This
made Andrew start violently. He tried to back away, but Riordan turned and
pushed him violently onto the bed, and he pressed his mouth onto Andrew�s soft
lips, becoming more erect as Andrew squirmed underneath him. 

����������� Yet,
despite the exhilaration from having warm, and naked
flesh wriggling underneath him, he felt nothing of love from the kiss and he
pulled away as quickly as he forced him on. At the release, Andrew leapt up and
pulled the bedsheets from under Riordan, to cover
himself. His trembling made the silk bedclothes ripple.

����������� The
room was silent for many minutes. Not a pregnant pause from two awkward beings
wanting to say something, but a barren, dried-out silence. 

����������� �Take
your clothes, Andrew,� Riordan said at length. His was shrunken and worn. �I
want nothing of you.� He went to his desk, and unlocked a drawer, and pulled
out a purse brimming with golden coins. He threw them at Andrew�s feet. �Take
my best horse, take food from the pantry, take that
stupid girl that they brought here last night. Take everything you need and
want, but leave soon. I am soiled while you are still here.�

����������� Then
Riordan left the room. Dazed from fear and betrayal and confusion, Andrew
dressed himself. He played with the purse-strings for awhile, before he decided
that despite his newfound hatred of Riordan, the money would help him get to Laurette faster. Feeling cheap, and used, and betrayed by
the man he had served and trusted, Andrew went to his room and packed his few
possessions.

����������� He
left Gabel Manor that evening, on foot. 

����������� Only
after he had made a deal with a merchant, and had secured a seat on a trolley
to the mountains, did he remember that he had left Andrine,
defenceless, in Riordan�s care.
