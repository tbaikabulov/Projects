Somewhere, driving down the autobahn, after a week away for work. Looking forward to a relaxing and lazy weekend at home. Already getting late and dark, just 200km more to go. Traffic, for a Friday evening, actually pretty good. Might be, that I am driving after the worst rush. The yellow light at the dashboard start to shine, and I have to look for the next gas station. A small break might be good too, been sitting for way to long. And a coffee, getting sort of tired from driving. 

Driving up to the gas station, it looks empty, except one car standing there with hood open. I start filling up my car, when the driver, a lady, approaches me. The water for the window cleaner is empty, and she is not sure how to fill it up. Fair enough, one are a gentleman, or not. Starting to take a closer look at the lady, I can not but like what I see. Early forties, chick. Half long coat on, and some nice looking leather high heeled boots. How she can drive with those, remain a question for me. 

We start casually talking, as I fill the water, just normal stuff. Claimed she had been on a long drive herself. As I go inside to pay, she follows me, and insist to at least get me a coffee for my trouble. After the long drive already, that didn&#8217;t sound as an all to bad idea. Paid, and enjoying the coffee, I take a closer look at her. Really a good looking woman. Rings on her finger as well her ear-rings do tell a tale of taste, and a little bit of money. A sweet smile, darkest brown eyes, leading one to think the sin-fullest thoughts

As we talk, she slowly starts stroking my hand gently. Looking at me, smiling sensually. Moving one boot forward, gently rubbing up my leg. One can not but be affected. A very soft voice, her gentle face, framed by her long red hair. How she laughs. Suggest I come with her, she lives only a few more km from here, if I would like a dinner. She would otherwise be so alone tonight. Better than eating alone at home, I think to myself, and agree. The sweet smile briefly turn into a wicked grin. 

Driving after her, it was not that long. A bit more than a few km, but still. And on the way I was be driving anyway. She lives in a small house, sort of outside a small village. Not to far, but still so one had ones peace and quiet, and no nosy neighbours. Once inside, offering to be a gentleman, I help her take of her coat. Revealing all black sexy skirt blouse combination, showing a tad of cleavage. A nice one to that. Very figure revealing, showing of her feminine curves. A simple white golden necklaces around her neck, with a long pointy cross hanging from it, directing the eyes of the admire to her cleavage. 

She lights a cigarette, standing before me. With her boots still on, she almost my height. Gently blowing the smoke in my eyes, she let the other hand gently over my chest, as she smiles. Teasingly pinching one of my nipples. Whispering to me; do I excite you? Do I scare you. I grin a yes to both. Her hand slowly moves upwards, and gently touches my face. The soft warm skin of her fingers play with my lips, before she blow the cigarette smoke again in my face. 

Enjoying her touch, as I am, I let her continue her surprising game. As she walks around and behind me, I can not but notice how I have gotten excited. She pulls my head back, and again blow the smoke over my face. Starting to wonder what bizarre experience this is turning out to be, her fingers over my lips tell me not to talk, not to ask, not to question, and not to breath. She whispers in my ear. Her soft warm voice tell me not to breath, it tell me to stand still. If I got infected by her voice when we met, it now turns more into an addiction. She does not really speak, more like singing, as her low voice moves to a rhythm. 

Gently she pull my arms behind my back, somehow tying them up. Did not see what she might have used. She blindfolds me, and ask me to stand still. I hear her tripping off, the boots on the marbled floor give her away. A room next to this, hearing a door open and shut. Quietness. Part of me want to get the hell out, part gotten excited, and want to stay. The later part won. 

Five minutes later, or so, difficult to know without a watch, the door opens again. I hear soft low music. Something classical. Not really my kind of music, or a music that I know much about. But the low tones makes me relax. The sound of her heels trip again against the floor, and I know she is coming towards me. A soft whisper in my ear, that is a good boy, standing all still. 

The feeling of soft satin to my face. Wondering. The voice was the same. Maybe got gloves on. She leads me towards from where she came. The door shuts behind us. Room feels a warmer than the entrance. Actually, a good deal warmer, even. Slowly she start to undress me, keeping the blindfold on, and ties my hands behind my back again, as I stand there naked. 

Slowly she leads me a few steps forward, and help me lay down, on what must be a bed. Feeling her hot breath to my skin, she whispers again, that she knew at once we she saw me at the gas station, that she wanted me. For wild and passionate sex, she claims. She nipples gently on my ear, before standing up. I lay there, naked, with a small tower standing up between my legs. The uncertainty, what is going on, what&#8216;s next, excites me. 

Removing the blindfold, I see she has changed. A long black night-gown, high heels and glows. I had felt it. Room, rather small, dark purple walls, only lit from candles. And only a bed in the middle, otherwise no furniture&#8216;s. And as said, warm, felt like 30ï¿½c, the least. 

Laying down next to me, she laughs gently, letting her hands rub over my body. Gently twisting the nipples again. This time a bit harder. Smiling. Her hand, slowly again, touching my face, gently across my lips, over my nose, making me close my eyes. She whispers, you are mine now, I will control you. I will tell you when to breath, when to speak, when to move, and when not to breath. Her voice turns into a hypnotic hym of words and orders, how her hot breath touches my skin. Whispering in my ear, nibbling on my ear. Her hand changing between playing with my lips, and pinching my nipples. 

She repositions herself, to sit next to me on the bed, removing her necklass. One finger opens my mouth gently, and slowly lowers the cross and chain into my mouth. What earlier not to be seen, the edges were sharp, carefully making small cuts in my skin, as it enters my throat. Letting it go as deep as possible, she slowly jerk it back a forth a few times. My gag reflexes wanting to act, though she uses her hands expertly, holding my head, across my mouth, over my throat. Removing it, she brings the cross to her lips, slowly letting her tongue touch it. You are bleeding inside, she whispers. 

Leaning over, her face close to mine, she smiles. Now that you have been prepared, its time for the next step, she whispers. With one finger at my lip, she notions me to open my mouth again, and she pours a fluid of some sort into me. Swallow, she whispers, it will break your last resistance, and make you a toy for me. Tasting sort of bitterly, I still swallow. She laughs, and smiles from my grimace. Feeling sort of warm and dizzy, it might be something to what she said. 

She stands up, and walks out, though through another door. A minute later, or so, she is back. Not longer than that I am still excited and ready. She feeds me a pill, and give me a glass to drink. Taste warm and salty. She softly grins, whispering, does my golden nectar taste? Not really a question, I knew, I did not answer. More wondering what kind of pill she feed me. She tells me, Viagra, making sure that I will have a heavy hard on, the whole time, until she is satisfied. And that having a hard-on makes me more gullible for what she want to do to me. 

Her hypnotic whisper continues, telling me when to breath. Her hand, as she lay next to me, play with my nipples. When she pinches, I can not breath, I am not allowed to breath, I am not able to breath. As she continues, I slowly feel, her words come through. For longer and longer at a time, she pinches the nipples, and my breathing stop. Her smile get more and more excited. Her rubbing against me, close, can feel her soft warm skin. Her sensual whisper. 

Getting two clamps, she places them on my nipples. When she pull the chain between them, my breathing will stop, when I just feel the clamps, my breathing might continue. Her glowed hand stroke slowly up my chest, under the chain, and touches my face. Gently over my mouth, she play the game with me, moving her arm such that the chain is pulled and not. 

The game continues, me getting dizzy, she seemingly playing with her self with her other hand, I can hear her getting more and more excited, Rubbing herself against my body. Whispering in my ear; she, as my goddess, do control me. Nibbling on my ear. Her hand pulling on the chain, holding over my mouth. Stroking over my face. As her breath becomes more heavy, I start to fear. The period she pull on my chain lasts forever, her hand holding tight over my mouth. She moans and let me loose. Exhausted, from not being able to breath, I lay there. 

While trying to regain, she had left me. Now noticing, somewhen, she had put four strap across the bed, holding me down. Over the chest, the belly, the hips and the feet. Making sure that I could not get up, that I could not move. My arms behind my back, able to hold out so far due to the soft bed, start to ache. How long have I been here. When will she come back. 

Door open again, and what must be her, returns. Now, a painted and feathered mask cover her face, as she walks in. Carrying two candles. The music changes. Still just quietly in the background. But from the classical orchestral, to a vocal chanting kind. Can not determined if it is more Indian kind, or maybe some church music kind. Standing at the head of the bed, she looks down at me. She must be kneeling down behind me, as suddenly her chest was just right above me. As she leans forwards, her cleavage smother my face. She whispers, asking if I enjoy myself. That I do not have to answer as my hard on tells her. 

Whispering, that she has to wear a mask for this, she can not stand the victim see her face. It ruins her orgasms, she claims, hoping that her selected one, will please me. A tied up victim, suffering from pain, scared, how such victim fight for air, under her, she smiles. That can bring her to an orgasm like no one else. Having explained her reasons, she gently, starting to drip the how wax from the candles, the voice behind the mask tells me to hold my breath. To let her control everything, as she knows best. Her voice so soft, sweet. So different from the action that occur. Would believe she is the vulnerable one, not me laying here tied up, at her will. 

The pain goes away, just feeling warmth, from the hot wax. Her voice telling me, that she will probably enjoy this more than I do. But that I should please let her do it, as it excites her so much. Her lips even whispers a please into my ear. Before I could answer, as if I was able, she smothers my face again in her cleavage. Noting, she must have just recently used some new perfume, rather strong, getting to me. Still, her soft warm skin, I softly kiss, and let my tongue lick and taste. Her laughter tell me she approves.

Standing there behind me, she moves back and forth, up and down. Between grinding her crotch to my forehead, letting the soft silk of the night gown over my face. And then back down again. Her face next to my head. Whispering in my ear. Slowly dropping the hot wax on the sore nipples. The game, her game, must have continued for over an hour. Causing me to slowly become exhausted. The pill, she gave at the start, still causing me to have a raging hard on. 

She attaches a short piece of yarn to the chain in the nipple clamps. Biting on the other end, making every time she moves back, that she pulls the chain, causing pain, causing me to hold my breath. And the hot wax drip over my body, making me shiver. Her aim moving upwards, starting to drip on my face. Making sure from a distance, making the wax not to hot. Feeling how she cover my eyes, making them close, fill me with fear, fear that I maybe should have gotten before. Slowly, she cover my face with the wax, as a mask over my skin. 

Tugging on the yarn holding the nipple clamps, she makes me almost go out of air, watching me as I am forced to hold my breath. Her conditioning, her voice, able to take control over my bodily function, her hypnotic skill. Seconds pass by, as she knows I will need more air, me starting to panic as I can not breath. And then, as she lets it go, my mouth opens wide, to breath in, she tilts her candles and floods the melted hot wax down my throat. Catching me by surprise. As she see the mouth is almost full, the candles are placed beside the bed, she stands up, before sitting down, crotch over, over my face, letting me fight a hopeless battle for air. . . .
