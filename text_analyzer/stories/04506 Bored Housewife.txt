Her life was a boring hellish existence.� She stood in front of the sink doing the
dishes for the hundredth time this week.�
As she moved her eyes to him she sighed.�
Look at him!� He�s fat and
lazy.� He was quite a catch when they
first started dating. �Fresh from the
military he was strong and buff.� He had
a mission and was determined to make a good life for himself.� They dated for 5 years before he finally
broke her down and convinced her to marry him.�
Things changed suddenly after that.�
His jumping from job to job and uncontrolled spending had eaten away at
their financial state.� He had become
lazy, complaining about the smallest chore he had to help with.� And with the laziness came the fatness.� Sex had become more of a chore than an
enjoyable experience, not to mention the fact that he couldn�t make her cum
anymore.� He was literally an 8 second
ride, barely starting before he was done, always leaving her unsatisfied.� She had tried to spice things up with toys
and play, but to no avail.� He took her
for granted and she was just bored with life.

&nbsp;

One of her friends had encouraged her to try some personal
websites.� She really liked a particular
one a lot.� It wasn�t just a �sex site�,
but had options to hook up for chat and friendship.� She figured what could it
hurt.� If nothing else she could find
someone to talk to.� She wasn�t
interested on screwing around but the loneliness had become more than she could
bear and her friends just didn�t get it.�
She logged on and filled out the profile making sure that she checked
the boxes that she was looking for friendship and talk only.� 

She got a couple of emails from some guys, but they were
obviously players looking for one thing only.�
She just ignored these idiots; it just wasn�t what she was looking
for.� 

&nbsp;

A few weeks went by and she had almost forgotten about
signing up on the website when she got a new
message.� She opened it and read it then
logged on and reviewed his profile.� He
was married also, unhappy with his life, but not looking to change his
situation.� He just wanted someone to
connect with.� She replied to his email
and they began chatting.� His life was so
similar to hers.� His wife wasn�t
interested in sex due to �female problems� and they just didn�t seem to be able
to talk anymore. �They chatted daily for
a couple months when he finally popped the question.� Would she go out to lunch with him?� She was somewhat shocked by his proposal, but
she felt comfortable about him and what could lunch hurt?� Its not like they
were meeting at a motel for an afternoon of hot steamy sex.� She agreed and he made the plans.

&nbsp;

It took her forever to get ready.� She didn�t want to dress over the top, but
still she wanted to impress him.� She
finally chose a simple pair of slacks and a low cut sweater.� She drove to the restaurant, all the while
feeling the butterflies in her stomach.�
She was so nervous she almost turned around and went back home.� No she told herself, this was just a friendly
meeting, nothing more.� She got out of
the car and walked inside.� There he was
sitting right where he said he would be.�
He was gorgeous.� She could tell
from his size he was tall and he had the most fabulous wavy black hair.� As if he sensed her he turned around and
smiled.� She walked to the table and sat
down.� They made polite conversation and
ordered a light meal.� When the lunch was
over neither was ready to call it a day.�
He suggested that they go for drinks and she agreed.� She followed him to a bar close by and they
ordered drinks.� They talked and laughed,
joked and flirted.� Before she knew it,
it was getting late.� She bid him goodbye
with a warm hug and he gave her a peck on the cheek.� She left feeling like a weight had been
lifted from her shoulders.� She drove
home and crawled into bed and slept better than she had in months.� 

&nbsp;

They continued to chat and meet for lunches and drinks for
many more months.� He was a police
officer and never failed to entertain her with stories of his job. He was never
was to forward always greeting her with a big hug and kissing her cheek at the
end of their date.� They talked about
everything.� He listened to her troubles
and she listened to his.� They had become
best friends.� 

&nbsp;

One day during their daily chats he again surprised her with
another proposal.� He was going out of
town for a conference and would be driving to it.� It was to far for
him to make it without stopping for a rest and he wanted her to go with him to
share the driving.� He offered to put her
up in her own room the entire time they were there and promised to be a perfect
gentleman.� She checked her work schedule
and arranged for the time off.� She told
her husband she was going out of town for a conference for work.� He probably wouldn�t even notice she was gone
except for dinnertime.� She packed her
stuff and was on her way.

&nbsp;

He lived in a different city and they had made arrangements
to leave her car there where no one she knew would recognize it.� She parked and waited.� He was late.�
Finally he arrived.� She had
decided to wear a skirt and top to be more comfortable while driving and give
her legs more room to move.� He drove a
large pickup with a camper shell.� He
loaded her bags and helped her climb into the cab of the truck.� She was excited about the prospect of a road
trip and getting away for a week.� They
got on the highway and started their journey.�
He drove well into the night and then they switched places.� He showed her to route on the map that she
was to take while he napped.� She
followed his directions and pulled over at the gas station he had told her
about.� They would fuel up and get a
quick bite to eat and then he would drive again.� They still had about a days worth of driving
to arrive at their destination.� They ate
at the restaurant connected to the gas station, he paid the bill and they were
getting ready to get back on the road.��
He walked her to her side of the truck and told her to wait there for
him; he had a surprise for her.� He went
to the driver�s side of the truck and opened the door.� She heard him fumbling around in the back
seat of the cab and the door close.� He
approached her and she could see he was hiding something behind his back.� She smiled a knowing grin and looked down,
she was embarrassed that he had taken the time to pick something up for her and
she was curious to know what it was. He reached for her and she recognized this
was his way of asking for a hug.� She
stepped into his arms as he pulled her close.�
She rested her cheek against his massive chest and breathed in his manly
smell while wrapping her arms around his neck.�
He hugged her tight and she felt at peace.� Then he reached up and pulled her arms from
around his neck and slowly pushed them behind her back.� It was very dark and she couldn�t see what
his surprise was yet.� Suddenly she felt
something close around her wrist and before she could comprehend what it was he
had enclosed her other wrist as well.�
Handcuffs, he had handcuffed her.�
She laughed and stepped back looking up into his eyes.� �What are you playing at?� she asked
him.� He grinned back and even though it
was dark she could see his teeth behind his lips.� �I�m not playing� he replied.� He stepped up to her putting his hand at the
base of her neck and pulled her mouth to his kissing her deeply and
passionately.� His tongue probed her
mouth and she felt it run against her teeth.�
Just as suddenly as he started he stopped and his hand moved from her
neck into her hair.� He wound his fingers
in its length and pulled her head back roughly.�
She was so stunned by the kiss she didn�t even have time to react. Her
head jerked back and she could feel the pull of her hair.� �I think that�s enough, I don�t like
this.� Un-cuff me and lets get back on
the road.�� He was still smiling and she
was close enough now she could see that his grin had a smirk to it.� She was starting to get a little
apprehensive.� She didn�t like the way he
was looking at her.� His voice startled
her when he spoke.� �Shut up!� You do not speak unless I tell you to.� This isn�t a game.� I have wanted you since I first laid my eyes
on you and now I mean to have you.� You
will do as you are told or you will suffer consequences.�� She blinked her eyes.� She didn�t understand.� What happened to him?� What was he talking about?� He answered her questions before she could
even speak.� �There is no
conference.� I�m taking you to a little
place I have rented for the week.� Just
you and me, I�m tired of your constant teasing and flirting and I have to say
I�ve been very patient in earning your trust.�
But its over, you are mine now and I will do as
I wish to every inch of your body.�� She
started shaking her head to tell him no, to stop this crazy talk when she felt
the palm of his hand connect with her cheek.�
He had hit her hard enough to knock her off balance and she stumbled
against the truck.� She scanned the
parking lot for someone to help her, but it was empty except for a few
cars.� Not a person in sight.� She was sobbing at this point and the sound
she made irritated him.� He had hoped
that it wouldn�t be necessary to gag her, but he wasn�t going to listen to
that.� He grabbed her shoulders and
twirled her around to face the truck.� He
pressed himself up against her and grinded his cock into her ass.� Even through his jeans she could feel that he
was hard.� Panic gripped her and she
struggled to get free, but she wasn�t going anywhere.� He had his feet on the outside of hers caging
her.� He pulled the gag from his back
pocket and wrapped it around her head.�
He pushed a small ball in her mouth and fastened it in the back.� He loved the look of terror in her eyes.� She was now cuffed and gagged.� Tears were streaming down her cheeks and she
kept shaking her head as if to tell him no.�
Like she could control him.� That fucking bitch at home thought she could
control him and he let her think that.�
Soon enough he would be free of her.�
He had inherited a large some of money when his father had died and he
had been very careful to make sure she had no knowledge of it.� It was safely tucked away where only he had
access to it.� If things worked out this
week, he may just pack up and leave taking his new prize with him.� He snapped himself back to the present and
again took in the site of her.� �Now time
to make some changes.� He told her.�� He
pulled a pocketknife from his pants and her eyes enlarged with fear.� He just chuckled.� �No need to worry baby, I�m not going to hurt
you with this.�� He pulled her skirt up
exposing her lacy panties.� �There will
be no need for these.� You will not hide
anything from me.� I know your mind and I
will know your body.�� He grabbed the
side and with one swift motion cut them.�
He repeated this on the other side.�
Her panties hug held by her legs being together.� He reached down and pulled them away.� His cock throbbed at the site of her ass
barred to him and couldn�t help himself.�
He had to touch her.� He rubbed
her ass cheek.� It felt as soft as he had
imagined.� He felt her slump against the
truck and even with the gag he could still hear her sobs.� Slowly he pushed a finger between her legs
and probed for her opening.� She was
wet.� Whether she wanted to admit it or
not she was aroused.� He slipped in one
finger and then another.� God she was
tight and warm.� He felt her tense and
push against him sobbing louder.� She
squirmed and struggled to get free.� He
like the struggle and pushed into her harder.�
He probed and played with her pussy until she was almost screaming
behind the gag.� Pulling his fingers from
her he pushed them under her nose smearing her own juices on her upper lip. He
whispered in her ear �That�s the smell of sex baby.� Isn�t it nice?�� She could feel his warm breath against her
neck as he moved his hands up her shirt and unfastened her bra.� He used the knife to cut the straps and
pulled it free.� Her breast jiggled with
the release.� He then grasped a breast in
each hand and rolled her nipples between his fingers pinching them.� Her knees started to give out and he forced
his knee between her legs to hold her up.�
He grabbed her hair and pulled her head back to his chest while he continued
to pinch and squeeze her nipple with the other hand.� Harder and harder he squeezed and pulled
until he knew it was painful.� She
continued to sob and fight him.� Didn�t
she know it was useless?� She was his
now.
