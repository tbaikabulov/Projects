Rainbow
 Falls

&nbsp;

Good weather had been so very rare
that spring.� A beautiful weekend was
promised and Ms. Catherine Langston looked forward to her ride with vast
enthusiasm.� 

&nbsp;

She woke early on Saturday and got
an early start.� Traffic was light and
she made excellent time.� She parked her
car in the designated area at High Gate stables and changed her drab civilian
garb and worn cross trainers for her riding attire and shiny boots.� She strapped on her rowelled spurs.� On her way to the stables, she stopped
briefly at the coffee shop. She filled her thermos with ice and diet soda and
tucked it back into her backpack.� Almost
as an afterthought, she grabbed a shiny red apple from the large bowl lying on
a table next to the door.� She had wanted
to bring Big Boy a treat and almost forgot.�
Sugar cubes were so bad for a Pony�s teeth.� As an afterthought, she stuffed a secpomd
apple in the backpack.

&nbsp;

The apple was just so
tempting.� She allowed herself just one
bite at first and then treated herself to a couple more as she crossed the
yard.� She wasn�t disappointed.� The fruit was fragrant and crunchy. Its sweet
juice flowed over her tongue and into her mouth.� She took another bite and another.�� She just couldn�t help herself.

&nbsp;

Madison, one of the exercise girls
greeted her in the yard.� �Hi, Ms.
Langston.� You�re taking Big Boy up to Rainbow
 Falls?�

&nbsp;

Catherine nodded, yes, and smiled
in anticipation.� The Rainbow
 Falls was a very special
place.� She felt a vast desire for its
beauty and solitude.

&nbsp;

�Well, he�s saddled and ready.� You should have a great ride, but there�re
rumors of ferals up there.� Are you sure
you want to go alone?�

&nbsp;

�I�ll be safe,� she reassured the
girl.

&nbsp;

Exactly as promised, Big Boy stood
saddled and bridled.� He waited for her
impatiently, tied at the slip rail.� He
was an impressive Pony.� At 2.1 meters
tall, he stood a full 50 cm taller than Catherine.� His weight was almost three times hers.� He was naked, of course, except for his
gear.� His heavy muscles hung in thick
well-cut plates.

&nbsp;

His grooming was painstaking.� The hair on his head was shaped into a thick
dark mane.� The hair on his face was
clipped to an even quarter inch.� His
profuse male body hair had been meticulously depilated.� His ample male paraphernalia were on naked
display. 

&nbsp;

Despite the well-known male
aversion to hygiene, Big Boy smelled only of his leather gear and the
proprietary ointment favored at High Gate Stable to protect Ponies from sunburn
and insects.� Grooming was important for
more than appearance sake.� Methodical
grooming accustomed even the most skittish Pony to handling.

&nbsp;

����������� Catherine
remembered the days before she could afford membership at the stables.� She volunteered as a groom in exchange for
privileges and more than once tended to a male secured over a solid
sawhorse.� Her friend Caitlin held his
buttocks apart, while Catherine, flashlight in one hand and tweezers in the
other, pursued the last stubborn hairs around his anus, all the time hoping
that this male at least, had civilized bathroom habits and a settled stomach.

&nbsp;

�Hey, Big Boy,� Catherine called out in case Big Boy
hadn�t heard her approach.� Her rowelled
spurs jingled as she walked.� Catherine
felt almost naked without them.� Big Boy
did not overlook their glistening sharp points or miss their meaning for an
instant.� Passing quickly behind him,
Catherine moved smartly.� She knew the
tendency of some Ponies to kick when they had the chance.� She took the opportunity to drag her hand
over his right buttock, just above her brand.�
She ran her hand over the thick muscles of Big Boy�s back.� He pulled against the slip rail and pushed
himself back against her hand, trying to increase the physical contact.� She patted him fondly on his muscular rump.
He was a spirited creature, and he was hers.�
Her brand marked him unmistakably as her property.

&nbsp;

Strong buttocks and legs were the foundation of a
good Pony.� Big Boy was among the
best.� His strong legs supported muscular
buttocks and his broad back offered his riders a secure seat.� His male size and strength were undeniably
impressive.� Her confidence in her
undeniable mastery thrilled her.

&nbsp;

��I�ve brought
you a treat, � she said brightly, then suddenly realized that not much of the
apple remained uneaten.

&nbsp;

Big Boy brayed his excitement.� As always, he was glad to see his mistress,
even giddy.� His surgically modified
larynx could not form words.� He opened
his mouth in eager anticipation.� He
thirsted endlessly for his mistress.� He
lived and died for her approval.� His
craving was unquenchable.� Ponies are
herd animals and Catherine, had impressed herself thoroughly on her Pony as the
uncontested leader of his herd.

&nbsp;

Trying to turn toward her, Big Boy pulled
unsuccessfully at the sturdy slip rail.�
His attention focused on her fist.�
As often than not, she brought him some sort of treat.� Salty or sweet, anything with flavor was a
welcome relief from the bland monotony of the nutritious stable diet.� Often Catherine reached into her small pocket
and retrieved a piece of dried fruit from her slit pocket.� Eagerly, Big Boy would open his mouth to
receive it.� He anticipated its tart
sweetness.� He sensed that the treat
shared the warmth of Catherine�s body.�
The dirt and grit acquired in its passage through her tight pocket did
not diminish his pleasure; rather he relished its nearness to her body. 

&nbsp;

Big Boy shared the stable with a number of Ponies
and he disliked each of them individually and despised them all
collectively.� His hatred was returned
intensely.� Today, Big Boy would not have
to share Catherine�s attention.� 

&nbsp;

Catherine�s dark hair was braided in a tight
ponytail for riding.� A brilliant white
silk blouse and black leather jodhpurs accented her olive complexion.� Knee-high black leather boots enclosed her
small feet and accented her shapely calves.�
From her belt, hung her worn leather crop.� A smile illuminated her face.

&nbsp;

����������� Catherine
pulled on her thin leather riding gloves.�
She could feel a male�s beard through the thin black leather.�� She slipped Big Boy�s reins from the rail.� The reins were connected to the control rods
set securely in his sensitive ear canals rather than to a bit as used with
equines.� Eagerly, Big Boy turned his
head and nuzzled her fist, hoping for a treat.

&nbsp;

Grinning, Catherine pressed her opened her empty
hand over his open mouth.� His fat tongue
tickled her palm through the fine thin leather.�
Big Boy�s enthusiasm faded when he found her hand was empty.� A sad frown darkened his guileless face.

&nbsp;

�Silly boy!� Catherine said
affectionately.� She popped the remnant
of the three-quarters eaten apple into his gaping mouth, not much more than a
core, careful to avoid dirtying her fingers and his sharp teeth. He took the
core eagerly and chewed noisily. He seemed to enjoy it immensely� � seeds and all.

&nbsp;

She pulled his head down to her by
his nose ring and planted a kiss on his forehead. �Big Boy, you�re such a good
boy!�� Curiously the word �man� had
passed out of common usage while the word �boy� had not. 

&nbsp;

����������� �Mount!�
she commanded and Big Boy knelt smartly with his left knee on the ground and
right knee bent at right angles.� He
wanted to please his mistress with all his being.� Catherine stepped up on his brawny right
thigh and swung her left leg over the saddle.�
She slipped her booted feet into the stirrups.� �Up!� she ordered and dragged her rowelled
spurs over his flanks and let him feel their sharp points.� Big Boy respected her spurs and acknowledged
her mastery instantly despite their vast disparity in size and physical
strength. .

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Catherine
loved to ride on the sandy beach below High Gate Stables in the first hours of
the morning.� The fierce power of the
summer sun was still gentled by the morning mist. The seaside sounds and smells
admixed to form a perfect balm to the hustle and bustle of her busy life.� Her palm pilot lay peacefully in her locker.
Her cell phone lay turned off and quiet.��
Wave following wave, the waves rushed up onto the beach and receded
smoothly into the ocean.� Her Pony�s
harness creaked rhythmically as his powerful thighs rose and fell.� His callused feet pounded the hard sand with
each distance-devouring stride.� Raucous
calls of sea birds accented the complex euphony. Catherine inhaled the tangy
sea air, aroma of richly polished leather and the faint musk of her Pony�s
perspiration. Her phone�s incessant ringing and her endless schedule of urgent
conferences and critical meetings slowly faded from her consciousness.

&nbsp;

Her saddle, perched high at the
back of her Pony�s neck, set solidly between his wide shoulder blades.� The saddle�s light-weight aluminum frame
secured his heavy arms and transferred her weight downward to his pelvis and
lowered their collective center of gravity.��
His neck was even thicker than either of her trim thighs that draped over
his broad shoulders and chest.� The toes
of her soft, leather mid-calf boots rested in the hanging stirrups. For now,
her heels rested lightly on his flanks.

&nbsp;

One might well wonder how a woman
might manage so large and strong a male. At 160 cm, Catherine was not short,
but the top of her head reached no higher than the middle of Big Boy�s
back.� He outweighed her more than
3-fold.�� However, experienced riders,
even smaller than she, easily controlled even larger Ponies with the padded
wooden dowels � called control rods - inserted deeply in their exquisitely
sensitive ear canals and held securely in place by a sturdy bridle � a leather
strap that passed around the forehead and over the back of the head and two
cross straps.� Stout hand grasps were
provided on either side where the strap passed over the temples. The slightest
pressure from the heel of a hand on a control rod pressed against the ear canal
and turned the Pony promptly to the right or left.� Pressure on both rods brought him smartly to
a stop. A male�s size and strength were firmly restrained to the service of his
female rider.

&nbsp;

The rising sun shone brightly.� The sky was a brilliant cloudless blue.� The run had been simply exhilarating.� Big Boy had answered her spurs promptly and
thundered down the hard packed sand along the ocean�s edge.� His strapping thighs rose and fell tirelessly
like the indefatigable pistons of a smoothly running engine.� His long, steady strides simply devoured
distance.� He responded to the touch of
her crop with yet more speed.� It was
enough to take one�s breath away.� The
wind had blown her sun hat back and it hung around her neck precariously by its
tie. Her thick ponytail streamed out behind her.� She chuckled to think that Big Boy�s strength
and endurance had perhaps even surprised himself.� 

�

&nbsp;

&nbsp;




iii

&nbsp;

At the mouth of the small stream,
Catherine �whoaed� Big Boy and pulled gently on the reining rods.� He slowed smoothly to a walk.� His chest was heaving and perspiration poured
from his great body but his efforts had not flagged until his rider had finally
called him to a halt.

&nbsp;

Catherine looked up the trail and
saw the lower pool and behind it, the lower waterfall.� She had seen it many times before and its
beauty never failed to take her breath.

&nbsp;

Catherine�s hand on the right reining rod directed
Big Boy up the trail.� Big Boy
turned.� He was less taken with the
beauty before him. Rather, he studied the softly rising path that ran beside
the stream up to the lower pool and then climbed more steeply up to the top of
the falls.� He examined the slippery ground,
doubtfully.� Given his druthers, he would
not venture up the treacherous path to the pool above the waterfall. However,
he was not the one to decide.

&nbsp;

The day was hot.� The secluded pool was waiting.� Somewhat impatiently, Catherine brought her
spurs against his flanks gently at first and then again more sharply when he
seemed to hesitate.� She swore she heard
him sigh, but he started slowly up the track.�
An experienced rider, Catherine let Big Boy pick his own way and set his
own careful pace up the path beside the stream and then up the difficult path
beside the falls.� Downhill was likely to
be even more treacherous.� However, he
was a sure-footed Pony and he wanted a tumble no more than she.� The waterfall soon roared before her and then
beside her.� Its spray wet the ground and
made the track slippery.� Her weight was
little burden for Big Boy even on the steep trail, even given the uncertain
footing.

&nbsp;

When she reached the top, she knew
once again why she had come.� As
beautiful as had been the lower falls, the Rainbow
 Falls were yet more beautiful and
the Rainbow pool deeper and more suitable for swimming.� Not one other person could be seen.� She saw no sign of any feral.

&nbsp;

�Dismount,� she ordered.� As trained, Big Boy knelt promptly, with his
left knee on the ground and his right knee bent at right angles.� Eager to swim, Catherine slipped from his
back and stepped onto his thigh almost before he had braced himself for her
weight.� Impatient to swim, she pulled on
his reins and half lead and half dragged her much larger Pony to the railing
the stables had so conveniently constructed.�
Deftly, she secured him to the railing, choosing the shadiest spot.� His arms secured to the saddle, he would be
unable to free himself.� In any event,
his thumbs had been amputated and his four-fingered hands had no ability with
knots or latches.� This morning, no other
Pony was tied at railing.� Finally, she
cuffed his right ankle with one of the fetters placed to keep a safe two yards
between Ponies.

&nbsp;

The ever-shifting feuds and
desperate competition among the stable�s males were a constant source of
trouble for the stable�s trainers, grooms, and exercise girls.� Caitlin had always said that an intact male
was conventionally lazy, impulsive, and prone to violence.� Catherine agreed that a girl�s first Pony
should always be a gelding.� Her first
Pony had been a black gelding, named Beauty. He had been a graduation present
from her granny.

&nbsp;

Doc Andrews first visit to the
stables after graduation in the summer was always especially busy.� Eager, chattering girls stood in line with
their newly purchased Ponies dressed in their crisp, new equestrienne
attire.� The stable�s always-hungry dogs
ran about, yapping excitedly.� Confronted
with the gelding frame, many Ponies balked, once they perceived its purpose.
Many embarrassed new owners needed help from the obliging exercise girls to
secure their Ponies. The newly made geldings offered no resistance as they were
led away.�� Their freshly taken testicles
lay ignored on the grounds until some dog or other overcame his fear and darted
in to seize his bleeding prize.

&nbsp;

More experienced riders often
preferred an intact male. One might impress herself totally on her spirited
Pony and construct a deep and durable bond.�
An impressed Pony�s craving for his mistress� attention was
unquenchable, his need for her approval desperate.� His feelings were often deeply ardent and
quite poignant in a sentimental sort of way - a source of public humor.� In the stables though, jealousy among intact
males was rife and anxious rivalry sometimes erupted into actual physical
aggression.

&nbsp;

Her second Pony had been a
superannuated intact male named Prince Charming.� She still had had her studio apartment then
and his price was right.� He had a great
heart and served her well for three years before his joints failed and she had
had to put him down.

&nbsp;

Quickly, Catherine checked Big Boy
out and found everything in order.� She
placed her gloved hand on the sweat-slick skin of his back. He was hot to the
touch.�� He gave off a tantalizing musky
aroma.� �You�ll be all right here,� she
said.� Eager for her touch, Big Boy
pressed himself backwards against her hand.�
Playfully, she slid her hand down along his spine to the top of the
crease between his muscular buttocks.

&nbsp;

�I�m going for a swim and I�ll be
back.�� Catherine said and then wondered
why she had bothered to explain herself to the beast.� She slapped his firm buttock playfully.

&nbsp;

Catherine looked for a dry place to
put her clothes and undressed.� She
shucked off her backpack. She pulled off her thin leather riding gloves.� Careful to avoid the sharp points of her
rowelled spurs, she wrestled off her boots.�
She unbuttoned her white blouse and peeled off her jeans.� She folded her blouse and jeans and laid them
carefully on top of her backpack.� Then
she stripped off her socks and panties and piled them on top, much more
casually. She almost forgot to remove the hat that still hung around her neck.

&nbsp;

Catherine stood stark naked except
for her waterproof watch, the fine gold chain around her neck, and her battered
sun hat.� The rounded lines of her soft
breasts accented the definite feminine sweep of her trim flanks and hips.� A pouting navel decorated her toned
tummy.� A rectangular thatch of tightly
curled hair crowned the unseen folds of her hidden sex.

&nbsp;

�She looked quickly to her Pony.� Big Boy stood at the railing, saddled and
bridled.� Otherwise, he was naked and
inarguably male.� Once upon a time,
Catherine had learned, a male might terrorize a score of adult women simply by
threatening to expose his male apparatus.�
That time was also safely in the past.�
His thick sex hung blatantly between his brawny thighs.� Her outstretched fingers could barely contain
his ripe scrotal sack.

&nbsp;

Big Boy strained against his
lead.� He tried to turn his head and look
back at his mistress.�� Stark naked,
Catherine looked at her own bare limbs and snorted.� Her soft feminine curves contrasted with the
male�s harsh angularity.� Thick plates of
muscle hung from his large frame.� Her
skin was smooth and unblemished.� The
stable�s grooms worked diligently to depilate the exuberant body hair that
betrayed Big Boy�s kinship with the bestial.

&nbsp;

It was all so difficult to
believe.� Now a woman�s female parts are
recognized as her glory while a male�s paraphernalia are universally
acknowledged as proof of his vulnerability.�
A metal ring pierced the glans of Big Boy�s circumcised cock.� The grooms clipped this ring onto a second
ring that pierced his navel, lifting his penis safely out of his groin and away
from his brawny thighs, exposing the fat scrotum beneath.� No one might now doubt who commanded and who
obeyed.

&nbsp;




iv

&nbsp;

����������� Catherine
checked her watch.� She lowered herself
into the crystal clear water.� She lay
back and luxuriated into cool water and warm sun.� She pulled her sun hat over her face and
closed her eyes.� She let her mind
wander, totally at peace and serene.

&nbsp;

����������� Suddenly, a
loud crash recalled her from her reverie.�
One female voice called out cheerfully.�
Another answered, more distant, and a second crash sounded, followed by
a shower of spray before Catherine could locate the source of the noise.� She pulled off the sun hat that shielded her
face and saw two bobbing heads, one blond and one brunette, in the deep
pool.� Two
 twenty-something young women squealed and splashed, gleefully.� Apparently, they had jumped from the Rainbow
falls, thirty feet above. 

&nbsp;

����������� �Hey,�
Catherine called, �watch who you�re splashing.��
Her friendly tone removed any hint of scold from her words.

&nbsp;

����������� �Hey,�
called the brunette, �Look, Emma, we�re not alone.�

&nbsp;

����������� �Where?�
called out the blonde.� �Where, Sheridan?�

&nbsp;

����������� �See, over
there!�� Sheridan
pointed.

����������� �� 

�Hey, over here,� Catherine waved and stood up.� �How did you guys get here?�� 

&nbsp;

Emma and Sheridan swam over and stood in the
shallows.� They were as naked as
Catherine. Once upon a time, a woman found unclothed might feel absolute fear
and if not fear of violence, total shame.�
Today, no one felt either dread or indignity, only honest and complete
surprise.

&nbsp;

�Hi, I�m Emma.�
We were camping above the falls,� the brunette answered.� 

&nbsp;

�Isn�t this spot beautiful � simply brilliant,� said
the blonde.� �Oh, I�m Sheridan.�


&nbsp;

�Catherine
could only agree.� �I�m Catherine
Langston.� I rode up from High Gate
Stables.� It�s really splendid up
here� - or I guess, down here, depending
how you look at it.��� She remembered
that they had leaped from the Rainbow
 Falls.� Taken with their na�ve enthusiasm and
friendliness, she had already forgiven their uninvited invasion of her solitude
and disruption of her serenity. The two girls reminded her of her niece.� She just wondered what they might think of
her suddenly ancient, thirty-something body. 

&nbsp;

�Have you seen any ferals?�� Sheridan
asked.� �We saw some signs around the upper
falls.�

&nbsp;

Catherine shook her head, no. 

&nbsp;

�You rode!�
Then where�s your Pony?�� Emma
scanned the bank.� One simply didn�t see
a mature male every day.

&nbsp;

Big Boy heard all the commotion.� The control rods blocked his ear canals and
diminished his hearing significantly.� He
pulled against his reins and tried to turn.�
However, he had little slack and he could see little.

&nbsp;

�There! There he is!�� said Sheridan.� In a flash, she was out of the water. The
water streamed from her very female body as she emerged from the neck deep
water.� The water formed droplets in the
neatly trimmed blonde brush that crowned her sex.� 

&nbsp;

�He�s really a big one!� said Emma joining her
friend at the railing, shaking the water from her brown hair.� Both were fit and attractive.

&nbsp;

Big Boy could see the young women now.� The women were as naked as he and their
gender was obvious and unmistakable.� He
was very aware of their nudity and close proximity. Saddled and hobbled, he was
completely helpless.� Anxiety growing, he
looked urgently for Catherine.� He had no
idea of what next they might do.

&nbsp;

Catherine saw the two women by her Pony. She could
sense Big Boy�s escalating agitation and reluctantly left the water to join
them.� Ponies were known to kick.� She was relieved that she had hobbled him at
the rail.

����������� 

����������� �He�s so
cute and he�s so huge!� marveled Sheridan.� Mature males were rare in the years since the
Revolution when women had finally discovered that a simple reduction in male
numbers had ended war and violent crime.�
Big Boy was a truly exceptional specimen in that severely reduced
number. �Can you imagine a time when half the people walking on the street
looked like this guy?� No wonder women
felt intimidated.�

&nbsp;

����������� �Big Boy is
huge,� Catherine agreed, then continued, �but we�ve got even larger males back
at the stables.� Very few ordinary males
were ever this large and they never walked around with their male paraphernalia
just hanging out there - ever.�� Mature
males were now confined to their ranches away from population centers until
they were processed.� Except for those
who visited the stables, worked on the ranches or at the processing plants, few
had contact with adult males.

&nbsp;

����������� �His skin�s
so smooth,� Emma observed. She stroked his skin gently but to his increasing
anxiety.� �He has no hair on his pubes �
silky as a baby�s bottom.� Just touch
him, Sheridan, if it�s okay with Catherine.�

&nbsp;

����������� �Go
ahead.� High Gate Stables maintains very
high standards for grooming.�� Catherine
wondered if the two young women understood just how much care Big Boy required.


&nbsp;

Sheridan touched him, tentatively
at first. �His pubes are smooth!��� Her
curious finger explored the ring that pierced his glans and secured his sex to
his navel ring.� Like all the males in
the stable, he had been circumcised to facilitate hygiene.� She ran her carefully manicured finger down
the length of his exposed sex and gently cupped his fat ball sack in her
outstretched hand. Wickedly, she ran her finger back up the length of his sex,
all the time watching his face.� �I heard
they really like this.� 

&nbsp;

Big Boy shuddered visibly.� He was utterly confused.� He was surrounded by naked female skin � bare
butts and tummies, soft, ripe breasts topped by pink areolas and darker nipples,
and the mysterious hidden place he could not name between naked female thighs.
He had never been the beneficiary of any sort of sex education.� However, he had powerful, uncontrollable
urges he simply did not understand.� 

&nbsp;

Feelings of panic rose.� He brayed his distress.� His nudity did not bother him.� He had always been naked.� He had also had some experience with
women.� Women had reared Big Boy at the
cr�che.� Women had broken him to saddle
and bridle.

&nbsp;

He remembered when his body
changed, demonstrating his undeniable otherness.� He had sprouted hair in all sorts of
unexpected places.� He had grown rapidly
in height and weight.� Within a short
time, he was taller and heavier than any of the grooms and exercise girls and he
kept on growing. His strength increased; his muscles enlarged and took new definition.� He had seen other joeys change before him but
unable to speak, had been unable to question them.� 

&nbsp;

The trainers had added more and
more weight to his training saddle.� He
had answered their challenge readily.� He
remembered the first time he had been bridled and saddled without any extra
weights.� Leah, the smallest exercise
girl, clambered up on his back.� He
carried her proudly around the ring, like one of the fully-grown Ponies.

&nbsp;

He also remembered the new feelings that he could
not name.� He awoke to find his penis
swollen and hard.� He felt pleasure �
intense pleasure - not pain � when he touched himself.� He remembered the time when Caitlin groomed
him and his body reacted. He was afraid but he knew he had done nothing on
purpose.� Caitlin had laughed � but
hadn�t seemed angry with him.� He felt
betrayed by his body.� She had touched
him gently and the soft touch of her hand had felt so very good.� She had smiled kindly, and told him that he
was a big boy now.�� Unable to talk, he
could not ask any questions or share any feelings.

&nbsp;

Later, alone in his stall, he had touched
himself.� Even with his vigorous training
schedule and thorough grooming, he had many long hours alone.� With enough touching, his penis spurted.� It was different than pee and felt so good.

&nbsp;

He remembered the night he awoke to a flashlight�s
harsh glare to find Caitlin and Catherine standing over him.� He started to stand.� Standing, neither of the women reached his shoulder
and he weighed more than the two of them together. When his eyes adjusted to
the light he saw the electric prod in her hand.�
A touch of the prod could reduce a full grown male to a urine-dribbling
heap of twitching arms and legs, choking on his own vomit.

&nbsp;

�Don�t move, Big Boy,� Caitlin warned.� Hastily, he lay back down. �Okay,
Catherine.� One more chance � truth or
dare!� Just tell me who you went out with
last night.�

&nbsp;

Catherine looked at Caitlin.� �Dare!� she said, defiantly. Then she
squatted next to Big Boy�s supine form.�
�Don�t worry, Big Boy I won�t hurt you,� she reassured him quietly.� Given the disparity in their sizes, her
reassurance might have seemed almost ridiculous.

&nbsp;

�Just tell me who you were with last night,� Caitlin
repeated herself.� �I could make you use
your mouth.�

&nbsp;

Catherine looked up at Caitlin and even in the
darkness, her eyes flashed with anger.�
�Dare!� she repeated.

&nbsp;

�Okay, just jerk him off.�

&nbsp;

Catherine steadied herself with one hand on Big
Boy�s belly and took his large sex in her small hand.� That night, she gave Big Boy real comfort.

&nbsp;

Today in the bright sunlight, Big
Boy closed his eyes and fought to calm himself.�
They seemed to swarm over him.��
Even without sight or sound, something of their female essence called
forcefully to him and moved him deeply to his masculine core.� Sun and exertion worked a subtle alchemy on
female flesh, eliciting a delicate but enthralling scent, accented by the faint
residua of enticing shampoo, sunscreen, and perfume. His poorly understood
feelings roiled. 

&nbsp;

His control totally overwhelmed, he groaned in
misery.� His sex engorged under
Sheridan�s provocative touch. Without volition, his pelvis thrust rhythmically
against her, trying to increase the delicious pressure.

&nbsp;

��Do you want
to have sex with me?�� She asked
laughing.� �See, he wants to have sex
with me,� she said brightly to the others.�
Lady, he�s as thick as my wrist! Well maybe not as thick � but almost.�

&nbsp;

Emma remembered that enough manipulation might cause
the creature to spew his mess.�
�Sheridan, just be careful!� This
might get a bit untidy,� she snorted, wrinkling up her nose.� 

&nbsp;

Sheridan pulled back her hand and jumped away. She
had no desire to see the beast spurt his filth on her clean body.

&nbsp;

�I had a dog once who humped like that,� Emma
offered.

&nbsp;

�Give my poor Big Boy a break,� Catherine gathered
up her Pony�s reins.� �He really can�t
help himself.�� She was truly fond of her
Pony.� His diligent service had earned
him at least a little bit of indulgence.�
She felt a delicious ache between her thighs, but the idea of intimate
relations with livestock was primitive and repulsive.

&nbsp;

�I think he�s disgusting,� ventured
Emma.

&nbsp;

�I think he�s kind of cute,�
answered Sheridan.

&nbsp;

�Would you like to go up on him,�
Catherine offered.� She retrieved her
crop from Big Boy�s saddle, then removed his hobble and unshackled his
ankle.� She gathered up his reins in her
fist.

&nbsp;

�Great, I�ll try.� responded
Sheridan.� �I wish I had a camera.�

&nbsp;

�Mount!� Catherine ordered.� For a long two seconds, Big Boy was
confused.� Catherine stood in front of
him and not positioned to his right.� She
swatted his knee with her crop and his confusion vanished.� He went down on his left knee and bent his
right knee at right angles.� �Grab the
bridle and step up on his right thigh,� Catherine instructed Sheridan.

&nbsp;

Sheridan grabbed his bridle and
hesitated a long moment.

&nbsp;

Catherine shook her head. �Step up
on his thigh with your right foot and swing your left leg over his neck.�� Big Boy won�t bite!�

&nbsp;

Sheridan lifted her right foot onto
his right thigh and swung her left leg over Big Boy�s thick, strong neck.� Her bare bottom, still wet, settled into his
saddle heavily.� Her feet still sought
the stirrups awkwardly, when Catherine ordered Big Boy, �Up!�

&nbsp;

Big Boy rose quickly and Sheridan�s
slippery bottom almost slipped from the saddle, her feet not yet in the
stirrups.� To keep from falling, she
threw herself forward and wrapped her arms around Big Boy�s head and her legs
around his thick, muscular neck.� �Don�t
look at me, don�t look at me,� she called, laughing at her own folly.

&nbsp;

Emma laughed aloud.� Her dark head shook with merriment.� Catherine worried that the raw girl might
hurt herself.� Sheridan hung on fiercely.

&nbsp;

����������� Big Boy
found himself smothered in wet, cold female flesh.� Sheridan�s soft breasts pressed against his
head.� Her trim thighs squeezed his neck
tightly and her coarse bush scratched the back of his neck.� Naked fear spiced Sheridan�s enticing female
essence. Big Boy turned his head and pressed his cheek into Sheridan�s bare
breast, thoroughly overwhelmed.� If he
could turn his head a bit further, he could take her nipple in his mouth.� 

&nbsp;

Aware only of the danger of
falling, Sheridan was oblivious to his presumption.� Catherine, though, saw it all.� She flicked her crop against Big Boy�s
exposed scrotum and he quickly regained his manners

&nbsp;

����������� After what
seemed an eternity, Sheridan�s feet found the stirrups. She disengaged slowly
and carefully, now firmly in the saddle.�
She grasped the reins in something like the appropriate grip.� �Hey, Emma, look at me! His facial hair � his
beard -� tickles.�� She touched her itching breast.� 

&nbsp;

����������� �Sheridan,
just be careful,� Catherine warned.�
�Okay.� Emma, do you want a turn
too?�� She dropped the reins and spun
around.� A heavy rock had crashed into
her shoulder.

&nbsp;

����������� �Run, you
asshole, run!� a coarse male voice shouted.�
The women looked up. Two feral males had appeared suddenly out of
nowhere.� Filthy rags half covered their
male parts.� Their odor was as
overpowering as their appearance.� One
had thrown the rock at Catherine.� The
second wielded a sharpened stick as a spear.�


&nbsp;

Big Boy hesitated.� He looked at Catherine.� The rock had almost knocked her from her
feet.� She stood stunned and cradled her
injured shoulder.� Her pain was apparent
in her face.� Then he looked at the
ferals who just stood their ground and taunted the women � males like him but
unrestrained by control rods and reins, living free without spurs or
whips.� Suddenly he realized that no one
held his reins, no one at all.� For once
in his life, he was free.� Big Boy took
off at a run.� However, the saddle still
restrained his arms. He sprinted toward the males.� 

&nbsp;

Sheridan shrieked.� She bounced in the saddle and hung on
precariously for dear life.� She didn�t
know whether to hold on or try to slip off Big Boy�s back.� She had no idea how to use the control
rods.� Big Boy ran, totally oblivious to
her screaming.

&nbsp;

Emma watched.� Her mouth gaped open but she was unable to
make a sound.

&nbsp;

Big Boy neared the male who had
thrown the rock at Catherine.� A novel
expression appeared on Big Boy�s face � anger.

&nbsp;

The first male did not see it.� He turned to leave and presumed that Big Boy
would follow and make his escape.� 

&nbsp;

Big Boy ran after him and Sheridan
hung on grimly.� He negotiated the
difficult ground with ease and continued at his very swift pace.� He had been raised and trained for speed and
endurance.� No one gave chase.

&nbsp;

Finally, Emma found her voice.� �Sheridan!� she wailed.

&nbsp;

At that instant, Big Boy caught up
the feral who had thrown the rock at Catherine.�
He changed direction slightly and ran full tilt into his back.� Big Boy outweighed him by a half and the
impact threw the male forward.� Utterly
surprised, the wilding hit the ground hard.�
Big Boy stumbled but kept his feet and came to an unsteady stop.

&nbsp;

Sheridan took the welcomed
opportunity to slide from the saddle.�
She hit the ground and fell, heavily.�
She stood shakily.

&nbsp;

The feral rose unsteadily to his
hands and knees.� Big Boy kicked him hard
and he fell again. The fighting skills that had served Big Boy in the stables,
helped him here.

&nbsp;

The second feral hefted his
makeshift spear and ran toward Sheridan. It was all so fast that Emma had no
time to do anything.� Big Boy ran to put
himself between Sheridan and her attacker.�
He ran into the spear shaft and spun the feral around. 

&nbsp;

The beast staggered but quickly
regained his footing.� He saw that he
faced three women and the large male alone.�
His companion was unconscious and no help.� He recalculated the odds in a flash, turned,
and ran off with typical male courage.

&nbsp;

�Mount� Catherine commanded and Big
Boy dropped on his left knee. 

&nbsp;

Sheridan squatted naked beside the
downed male.� He began to stir.� �Has anyone got a knife?� she asked,
searching the ground to her left and right.

&nbsp;

�I�ve got a pocket knife in my back
pack somewhere,� Catherine offered, trying to be helpful.� Her painful shoulder still throbbed.� She started toward where her backpack lay
with her clothes.� �Someone get Big Boy.�
The pain in her shoulder was obvious.

&nbsp;

Emma quickly grabbed Big Boy�s
reins.� She gripped them tightly.

&nbsp;

The feral male moaned and began to
rise, slowly and unsteadily.� He
struggled weakly to his hands and knees again and paused.

&nbsp;

Anxiously, Sheridan looked quickly
at Catherine and then at Catherine�s backpack.�
Surrendering to the emerging crisis, she grabbed a fist-sized rock and
hit the side of the wilding�s head.� She
hit him again hard and he collapsed back to the ground.� She hit him two more times and bloody fluid
ran from his nose and ear.

&nbsp;

Sheridan stood with the bloody rock
still in her hand.� She looked down and
studied her victim.� She rolled him onto
his back with her foot.� Without
resistance, he flopped limply over supine.�
Sheridan took careful aim and soccer-kicked his lolling head.� The side of her foot lifted his entire body
from the ground to the waist and when he landed, his neck was bent at an
unnatural angle.� �It�s a lot easier if
you have a knife,� she said very matter-of-factly.

&nbsp;

Sheridan straddled his unmoving
form and looked down.��� �Someone had
better call the rangers.�

&nbsp;

�I�ve got a cell phone just
somewhere in my backpack,� Catherine confessed as she went to retrieve Big
Boy�s reins from Emma.� She thought she
might also find an uneaten apple for Big Boy.
