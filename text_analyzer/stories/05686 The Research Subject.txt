OverLord, 20070724

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

You arrive home
after dark, fatigued after another long afternoon at the clinic. As usual the
hot, needy throbbing between your legs is only slightly reduced by this weeks'
session of multiple mind shattering orgasms, and it is distracting enough to
make finding the front door key in the dark a little difficult. Hard to feel
for the right key in the bunch by finger touch, when your sex is so firmly
begging for touch. Already.

&nbsp;

You get the door
open and walk through to the kitchen, turning on the lights. You notice there's
a slight abrasion around your wrist; the left one this time. You sigh. Long
sleeve blouses for a few days at work again. You wish they didn't have to do
the cuffs up so tightly. But still.. better that than no orgasms.

&nbsp;

Setting your bag
down on the bench you open the fridge to decide on dinner.� Hmmm... too tired to feel like cooking;
probably leftovers then. Glad your SO isn't home tonight, no one else to think
about feeding. Oh, and what about the rest of the Chinese you didn't have time
to finish at lunch today, before your appointment?

&nbsp;

You set out the
containers of cooked rice and spicy chicken on the bench, and unzip your bag to
dig out the Chinese noodles. The zip... an association with the sound of your
jeans unzipping... no. Not tonight, not so soon.

&nbsp;

Huh? What's this?

Among your
assorted junk in the large zip-up shoulder bag, there is a slim blue ring bound
folder of papers. You've never seen it before - how did it get there? You pull
it out, mystified.

&nbsp;

In its clear
spine pocket it bears a typewritten slip of paper:

&nbsp;

&quot;PATIENT
CASE STUDY� -� Jean B.���
CONFIDENTIAL&quot;

&nbsp;

Your eyebrows
rise - that's your name. How....? Some mix up at the clinic? Not as if you are
going to leave this unopened!

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Inside the
folder, the cover page is a bright yellow card:

--------------------------

�Page 1

&nbsp;

��������������������� ***WARNING***

&nbsp;

�Document NOT to be shown to Patient under any
circumstances.

&nbsp;

�Patient is highly suggestible, and exposure to

to resolve or

�at least abate with treatment. It is felt she
will be better

�able to cope with her condition if she

�not continue indefinitely.

&nbsp;

---------------------------

&nbsp;

A wave of
faintness makes you lean heavily against the bench top. What is this...? You
had been assured your problem was treatable! Your life recently has been hell,
ever since you read that damned story off the web. Well, not exactly 'hell',
but very difficult. Complicated. Though you have to admit, your present
situation has its upside. But it does make things like concentrating on your
job very problematical. What does this mean, 'exacerbate her condition'? How
could it get any worse? OH! On second thoughts, you suppose it could. If the
sudden wild flare of heated tension between your legs is any indication. Damn!
So soon... Your heart rate is rising too. Perhaps you should accept the
warning, and not read any more.� ....
After a moment's hesitation, you give in. As if there was ever any chance of
your *not* turning the page...

�Case Summary

&nbsp;

�Background

&nbsp;

Subject presented
at initial consultation with request for standard pelvic checkup, while
asserting general good health. Patient appeared flustered and breathless, with
difficulty in expressing herself, and pronounced facial blush. Preparations for
pelvic were begun, but halted for ethical considerations before physical
contact due to pronounced patient genital arousal and inability to maintain her
composure. Further verbal investigation was resumed, during which patient
remained on the examination stirrups, apparently finding this position to be
helpful in overcoming her reticence to discuss her (now visually obvious)
difficulty.

&nbsp;

Once the nature
and seriousness of her complaint became apparent, Patient participated in frank
discussion of options for investigative procedures. The ethical and legal
situation was fully explained to her. Patient agreed to, and signed all
necessary consent forms, after carefully reading them.

&nbsp;

Thus began the
lengthy investigations detailed here. These have involved numerous
investigative and therapy sessions, still ongoing. Her case is apparently unique
in the literature, and appears to present significant potential for
advancements in the study of human sexuality.

&nbsp;

This document is
a review of the case to date, in support of and in conjunction with proposal
for funding of continuing study.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Characterisation

&nbsp;

Patient is
female, aged 32, height 5' 8&quot; (173cm), physically fit.

Sexually active,
previously easily and multiply orgasmic. Married, in loving relationship, but
in which she tends to not receive satisfactory sexual attention due to partner's
(alleged) lower than average libido.

Patient
compensates by reading Internet pornography in conjunction with masturbation,
and sometimes seeks casual partners online.

She is somewhat
suggestible, has prior experiences with hypno-sexuality.

Never previously
experimented with prolonged orgasm denial.

Review

&nbsp;

Patient's history
narrative indicates a narrow margin of sexual responsiveness abatement upon
orgasm. She reports her post-orgasmic arousal to have been always very easily
maintained or re-stimulated. On some occasions in recent years, arousal is
reported to have occurred spontaneously, unassociated with sexual activity, for
unknown reasons, and for significant duration of time. Intervals ranged from
approximately three hours, to two days in one recent case, with resolution
occurring either spontaneously, or via masturbation to orgasm. This history
suggests a tendency toward PSAS (Persistent Sexual Arousal Syndrome) though
until recently still outside that categorisation.

&nbsp;

Analysis of her
self-reported sexual history over time suggests that this margin may have been
diminishing - that is, she had been developing a tendency towards greater
intensity and persistence of arousal signs.

&nbsp;

In many reviewed
cases the mechanism of PSAS has not been convincingly identified as either
physical or psychological. Indeed, there is evidence that the syndrome may
result from one or more interactions between those two. In Patient's case, it
appears that she was possibly in process of becoming PSAS-prone before she
recently exposed herself inadvertently to an unusual work of erotic fiction.
The written story, in conjunction with an associated audio soundtrack purported
to convey a hypnotic-suggestive meme involving libido increase and persistence
combined with orgasm blocking hypnotic-suggestive directives.

&nbsp;

Whether the
orgasm blocking portions of the meme might have been taken up by the patient's
subconscious in other circumstances is unknown. However, Patient happened to
identify with the fictional plot closely enough to deliberately withhold her
orgasm for a lengthy duration of self-stimulation, during and immediately
subsequent to her exposure to the story and audio content.

&nbsp;

The result was
that due to genital masturbation fatigue, she found herself unable to orgasm
when she eventually chose to achieve relief. This had the unfortunate effect of
strongly reinforcing the 'orgasm block' suggestions in the story. She believed
she had been 'ordered' to be unable to orgasm - a self-fulfilling belief, even
if unfounded. It should also be noted at this point that the authors have no
evidence to support or disprove the hypothesis that such a hypnotic 'no orgasm'
directive could actually be effective.

&nbsp;

It is surmised
that this state of intense sexual tension, combined with her inability to
orgasm, exacerbated her pre-existing PSAS tendencies. The effects were
self-perpetuating - the longer she remained aroused, yet unable to orgasm, the
more her frustration, the greater her conviction that she was now unable to
achieve orgasm by her own efforts, and the further entrenched became her
persistency of arousal.

&nbsp;

Possibly there
may be underlying physiological changes as well, consequent to unusually
prolonged and pronounced vascular engorgement of the clitoro-genital region.
Although the proportional contribution of physiological vs psychological
factors, and precise nature of those contributions to her condition are
unknown, it manifests as virtually permanent, maximal sexual tension. There is full
involvement of all sexual organs and secretory glands, accompanied by marked
fixation of Patient's attention upon her condition. Described by Patient as a
&quot;never ending desperately aching desire for unobtainable relief.&quot;

&nbsp;

Her 'certainty'
of inability of achieving orgasm does not involve an aversion to normal
intercourse, self stimulation, or an inability to heighten her arousal by
genital manipulation. On the contrary she reports, and regularly demonstrates
in therapy sessions, that she is fully capable of masturbation, and does so
often. However, despite being able to bring herself to a point (and past it)
where orgasm should naturally occur, it does not.

&nbsp;

In terms of
research, that condition is most rewarding to study. It appears that her
physiology does indeed arrive at a condition so far indistinguishable from the
very onset of orgasm - and then halts there, in a state which is normally very
fleeting. In Patient this 'infinitesimally removed from orgasm' condition can
be maintained for considerable lengths of time, and is thus accessible to
detailed study. In actual fact it is quite persistent on its own, and even if
Patient ceases her self-stimulation, it has been observed to last up to 37
minutes. These episodes leave Patient still aroused, and even less satisfied
than before. Despite this unrewarding outcome, if left to herself Patient will
be driven by her need for relief to repeat the experience several times a day.

&nbsp;

As was
demonstrated in the experimental sessions, it is possible for Patient to
experience orgasm still, but only when stimulated by other persons or
mechanisms in scenarios in which she is unable to influence the proceedings.
Apparently this situation bypasses her now deeply ingrained subconscious belief
that she cannot herself achieve orgasm, due to the 'instructions' of the story
she read. [Ref App. C.] In the scenario of that story, her ability to orgasm is
totally dependent on a specific interpersonal power relationship, in which she
is convincingly 'forced' to do so. To all practical purposes her conviction in
the story's truth seems indistinguishable the reality of her body's responses,
hence the experimental protocol. [Ref App. H.] By those means Patient can be
very easily and rapidly brought to orgasm, as well as a variety of maintained
orgasm plateaus and repeated orgasms, via the various known mechanisms -
clitoral, vaginal, g-spot, etc.

&nbsp;

Such episodes of
induced orgasms provide Patient with temporary relief from an otherwise
near-permanent sexual arousal and intense feelings of physical frustration.
However, the intervals of such relieve can be brief, and seem to be diminishing
over the interval of observation so far.

&nbsp;

It should be
noted that her husband is not an assertive type, and apparently is unable or
unwilling to assume the role model Patient finds necessary to 'force' her
orgasm.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Patient's
condition can be categorised as:

&nbsp;

* PSAS,
auto-erotic orgasmically challenged.

* Physical vs
psychological basis unknown.

* No gross
physical abnormality detected.

* Genitalia well
formed and trim, all within norms except for clitoral development, which is in
the upper limits of statistically normal size.

* No known
neurological impairment.

* X-ray and
ultrasound imaging within normal limits; all clitoral structures typically
engorged and vascular involvement prominent.

* Blood factors
within normal ranges.

* Oncological
assays: negative.

* STDs: negative.

*
Psychological� state: Stressed, stemming
from persistent sexual arousal and orgasmic insufficiency.

* Some social and
concentration impairment due to intensity of arousal effects.

* Otherwise
healthy.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

[Hand written
note in margin: &quot;This reminds me of that Monty Python sketch-

'the lethal
joke'! This one is the 'horn bug story'!]

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Prognosis

&nbsp;

Her condition is
not life threatening or likely to lead to physical complications. Some social
functional impairment results at present. While not greatly significant under
existing circumstances, this factor may become an issue if other aspects of her
situation deteriorate. One positive side effect is a subtle 'glowing aura of
intensity' she now exhibits.

&nbsp;

The core problem
is her continuing sexual frustration, and her conviction that her inability to
orgasm is due to her having been 'ordered' to deflect from orgasm. Since this
self-reinforces whenever her sexual frustration leads her to attempt

relief via
(always unsuccessful) masturbation, which can be several times per day, the
conditioning has grown immovably strong.

&nbsp;

Extensive and
innovative attempts to decondition her (and thus allow her to relieve her
frustration herself) have failed to achieve significant results.

&nbsp;

It appears that
hopes for spontaneous recovery (to a more normal sexual state) are faint.

&nbsp;

Apparently her
partner cannot be relied upon to provide her with relief at all, let alone
often enough to fully allay fears of frustration induced psychological damage,
and may even respond to her increased needs by complete withdrawal from sexual
relations.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Recommendations

&nbsp;

Due to her generally
high arousal, which rises very markedly in situations where she has an
expectation of being brought to orgasm by another, it is difficult for her to
ensure the use of either pregnancy or contagion protection.

&nbsp;

Thus she is
considered to be at multiple risk: both to her psychological well being if she
abstains from or cannot find satisfactory partnered sexual relations, and to
unwanted pregnancy and potentially fatal disease consequent to sexual relations
beyond her marriage.

&nbsp;

It is therefore
proposed that patient be considered a special case under the Health Insurance
Scheme, and that so long as her unusual condition persists, funding be
allocated to continue provision of therapeutic sexual relief on a regular
basis, under the controlled medical conditions found to be effective. [Ref App.
H - 'Patient orgasmic relief protocol']

&nbsp;

Legal opinion
obtained on this matter maintains that under the present legislation Patient
would have strong grounds for suit against the Health Provider, for failure of due
care and reckless and knowing endangerment of her health, should such funding
be denied her. The matter of frequency of 'regular basis' appears to be open to
legal debate, however it is possible that if brought before the courts, verdict
could be very much in Patient's favour. Possible ongoing costs could be high,
and the legal precedent unwelcome for budgetary and public relations reasons.

&nbsp;

An alternative
means of providing for Patient's continued well being, involves granting
government health research funds to support ongoing studies involving Patient's
condition. Such research can be arranged to involve adequate protection of
Patient's mental well being, via either controlled provision of appropriately
managed sexual relief at suitable intervals, or close and continuous
supervision by qualified professionals. In discussions with Patient it has been
determined that she is prepared to bindingly forgo her rights to Health
Provider funded services, dependent upon such an arrangement involving continuation
of present research studies and agreements.

&nbsp;

In that light,
referring to the existing release forms [Ref App. A] signed by Patient,
consider that patient undertook a binding consent agreement with the authors of
this paper that she consigns all decisions regarding her treatment and care to
the authors, for the duration of their research into her condition, in return
for their efforts to determine the nature of that condition. Thus, if at some
point in the research the authors feel it necessary to take her into full time
care, they may do so. Likewise the frequency and manner of her 'relief' may be
chosen by us at will, including complete withholding for any period we deem
necessary to the research and her long term well being.

&nbsp;

Presently, we
feel frequent provision of relief is beneficial to our investigations. However
it is also clear that at some point, investigation of Patient's solid
conviction of her inability to self-orgasm will have to be tested against a
lengthy (possibly indefinite) interval of orgasm withholding. Since
self-stimulation presently achieves only reinforcement of her own belief in its
futility, this too would be disallowed. Protracted total sexual abstinence
under controlled conditions is considered a treatment option worthy of exploration,
both for insight into the psychological aspects of her condition, as well as
the opportunity presented for controlled study of the physiology of Persistent
Sexual Arousal Syndrome over an extended interval. 

&nbsp;

The matter of a
cure, being impossible to guarantee, is not stated as a prerequisite in the
contract, only a theoretical objective. Likewise her 'enjoyment' or general
comfort and composure are explicitly granted to be secondary matters to the
primary objective of investigative research, as is the crucial point of
'incidental harm'. Legally this is fully sufficient to cover more speculative
investigations, such as testing the resilience of her orgasm block via
constantly maintained high levels of sexual stimulation over long orgasm-free intervals,
regardless of her objections.

&nbsp;

Patient has
contracted to continue to participate in the research, unconditionally and for
its duration as determined by the authors, with large financial penalties for
withdrawal, as well as a physical enforcement clause. Investment of funds and
effort in the project to date and in future are thus fully protected.

&nbsp;

Naturally, due to
the nature of her condition, Patient also signed the standard waiver of rights
to modesty, as well as agreement to any and all explicitly sexual procedures,
and in addition to necessary physical restraint. Additionally, Patient signed a
Confidentiality Agreement covering all aspects of the research program, in
effect for the duration of continuing research. It is significant to note that
this agreement is non-mutual, in that all collected research materials,
including interview and therapy session audio-visual recordings, may be
published by the authors as they see fit.

&nbsp;

The Research
Grants Board should note that Patient's regular appointments for therapeutic
procedures are on the Wednesday of each week, at 1pm, at the author's rooms.
Such procedures are conducted in an area with the usual one way observation
mirror and soundproofed comfortable viewing compartment from which an observer
may monitor proceedings. Up to about 15 observers, actually. Tea and biscuits
can be provided.

&nbsp;

There's more of
it. By now you've sunk down onto one of the kitchen stools, panting, the folder
on the bench top as you flip through it, dazed and shaking. Random phrases
you've just read ricochet around in your mind. 'hopes for spontaneous recovery
are faint' ... 'binding agreement' ... 'orgasm withholding' ... 'full time
care' ... 'extended interval' ... 'constantly maintained' ...

Flipping, the
folder falls open at Appendix H, and you resume reading. As if you aren't quite
familiar with this part.

&nbsp;

Appendix H

&nbsp;

Patient orgasmic
relief protocol

&nbsp;

*******CONFIDENTIAL*********

&nbsp;

Details of the
treatment protocol determined via experiment to reliably allow Patient-X to
achieve effective orgasmic relief of sexual tensions, within a one hour
therapeutic session.

&nbsp;

Notes:

&nbsp;

This treatment
may be considered extreme and/or morally dubious by some, due particularly to
the aspects of non-consensuality, physical restraint, and discomfort involved.
The reader must be aware that these aspects are required, due to the peculiar
nature of Patient-X's condition, and that without them, she simply cannot achieve
relief.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

As stated
elsewhere, her difficulties include a deeply held, persistent, and
self-reinforcing belief that she 'is not permitted' to achieve orgasm by any
action of her own. Consequently the protocol is required to provide not just an
impression of loss of volition, but actual, realistic and fully evident loss of
volition. If the patient feels in any way able to influence the course of
events, she is unable to orgasm. Furthermore, her loss of volition must be
forcibly demonstrated to her, in a manner that speaks to her deeper unconscious
mind. Anything less simply does not bypass her 'mental blocks' against orgasm.
This presents a logical quandary - patient desires orgasm, and so desires to
submit to the treatment protocol. But in this sense by submitting to treatment
she is acting of her own will to achieve orgasm - and so can not. Only once she
desires to NOT continue with the protocol, yet is forced to continue anyway,
can her desired orgasm be reached, contradictory though that may seem. The
logical resolution is provided by the imposition of painful yet harmless
stimulation to sensitive zones, such as the buttocks and breasts. Only once the
discomfort of this component is sufficient to convince the patient that she has
changed her mind, and would rather stop the treatment, in the process foregoing
orgasmic resolution, can further sexual stimulation achieve the intended
result.

&nbsp;

There is thus a
fine balance, between the patient's rising sexual tension during the intervals
between treatments, and her aversion to the expected discomfort involved in
achieving relief. Even with this balance, there is a contradiction - the longer
the interval between treatments, the more intense her PSAS symptoms grow, and
hence the greater her desire for relief at commencement of the procedure. Thus,
the more intense the applied 'discomfort' must be, before that desire is
overcome, till she wishes to cease the procedure, and hence can be 'forced' to
continue on to orgasm and subsequent (temporary) relief of her physical
symptoms.

&nbsp;

Consequently it
has been determined that the patient responds best if the entire cycle is
presented as mandatory - that even the scheduling of treatment sessions be set
with no choice on her part, and with a degree of coercion. At present the
treatment protocol is set at once weekly, with no rescheduling allowed. If she
misses a session, she has to wait a further full week till the next, and the
threat of termination of treatment altogether. As well, the first session after
a missed appointment involves a modified 'recalibration' protocol, which she
knows may potentially fail to bring her to orgasm. Despite beginning with an
extended 'discomfort' routine, followed by prolonged sexual stimulation, thus
guaranteeing her a very difficult further week till the next treatment session.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Protocol

&nbsp;

Sessions: Once
weekly.

Session duration:

�* Standard Routine:- one hour.

�* 'Recalibration' Routine (first after missed
session):- two hours.

Scheduling:
Patient is informed peremptorily after each session of the next session time,
and warned of consequences of missing appointment.

&nbsp;

Standard Routine

&nbsp;

�- All proceedings are 'in camera', and
recordings archived. Patient is aware of this via the consent forms.

�- On arrival patient is admitted to treatment
room, and required to disrobe in the presence of the female medical assistant
and one or more of this paper's authors (male, MDs.) 

�- Patient required to mount examination
stirrups.

�- Speculum inserted, expanded, initial
internal exam. Speculum left in place throughout following.

�- Patient firmly secured in mod-gyno stirrups.
wrists, ankles, neck, waist. Body tightly stretched, spread eagled.

�- Vital signs monitors attached.

�- Verbal exam- report on week's activities and
state.

�- Standard exam, quantification of genital
state, clitoral &amp; g-spot erection, photo record.

�- Speculum removed and replaced with balloon
probe, vaginal static and pulse volume and elasticity, etc. 

�- Application of genital stimulators.

�- Initial responsiveness measurement run,
continued up to point where orgasm should (but doesn't) occur.

�� Apply robotic phallic thrusting and clitoral
vibratory stimulation, using standard device.

�- Maintain verge-of-orgasm state for 15
minutes.

�- Apply 'discomfort' (paddle spanking spanking
robot) to buttocks, while continuing genital stimulation.

�� Continue with increasing severity till
patient expresses clear and strong desire to cease the treatment.

�- Cease spanker, increase genital stimulation
to full. Continue without let up for remainder of treatment hour, with
stimulators set for brief power reduction after each orgasm but rapid rebuild
to full, and spanker set to cut in again whenever subsequent orgasm does not
occur within five minutes of stimulators ramping up to full power. Spanking
halts at each orgasm.

�- At end of session, halt abruptly, remove
attachments and dismount patient posthaste. Assistant to dress patient
hurriedly (outer garments only, no underwear) and remove her to public
reception room immediately before she has time to freshen up. Receptionist to
inform patient clearly and sternly of her next 'orgasm therapy session' in
front of other patients in reception.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

'Recalibration'
Routine

&nbsp;

As above, except
genital stimulators set to drop back to low power at some random point short of
orgasm, then ramp back up once arousal has dropped significantly. Spankers cut
in if arousal above 50%, and stimulators on low power only; stop both spanking
and all stimulation if arousal approaches orgasm.

Continue this
regime for full duration of treatment, then stop, regardless of patient wishes.

&nbsp;

---------------------------

&nbsp;

You close the
folder, unable to cope with more of this just now. Among the whirlwind of
thoughts and feelings in your head, one hangs still for a moment, incongruous
in its neutrality. 'Well that explains those couple of hair-tearingly
frustrating times you weren't able to come, the next week after you'd missed an
appointment.' The ache between your legs is very strong now. Throbbing and
damp, you can feel the slickness seep into your panties, your jeans. Already
your nipples are rigid - this usually doesn't happen for at least a couple of
days after your clinic sessions. A long shaky sigh - its going to be a long,
frustrated week. Till next... till next... But this...? Can you go back? They
are... they think they can do... they can treat you like some kind of
experimental animal! &quot;Uuuuunhh!&quot; You gasp, bending forward till your
forehead rests on your hand on the folder, your other hand gripping your knee
as your hips grind on the stool. Oh, an experimental animal.... why does that
thought make your sex convulse so intensely? ... 'regardless of her objections'
they say here. Surely they can't? Yes... yes they can. They will. And you'll...
you'll...

&nbsp;

You think of the
videos they have - hours and hours of naked, bound and heated, screaming sexual
abandon. You think of just not going back next week, and... and... not getting
to come. If only you hadn't ever read that damned story! Look where its brought
you - on the brink of admitting to yourself that you _are_ an 'experimental
animal'. That somehow, the very thought of being in this position makes your
insides melt.

&nbsp;

There's more in
the folder yet, but you get the idea already. Why did someone put this in your
bag? You guess they were testing you. Or teasing, toying with you. But really,
they know what you will do.

Next Wednesday,
you will be there at 1pm, sharp. The Research Grants Board will enjoy their
fucking tea and biscuits and live action porn. And you... will get what you
need too. For quite some time.

(For now. I've
some notes on extending this to a longer, much more complex story. Maybe it
will happen.)
