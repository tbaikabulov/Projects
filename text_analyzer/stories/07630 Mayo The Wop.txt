MAYO THE WOP

Part One

In a dark street somewhere in the twisty depths of London, the light of a torch bounced off the walls, flickering amongst the wet stones. It caught a rag on the ground, a dark lump of body. The torch bearer ran forwards to see better, shining the torch straight into the face. A hand reached out trying to block the flare, but the men grabbed it and dragged the body upright onto his feet revealing the tender complexion of a fifteen year old boy with black fine curls and the fast evidence of a beard, his brown eyes fierce. He was dressed in rags, several different t-shirts and a pair of jeans, significantly too big for him that he had tied tightly at the rest. Ignoring him the men kicked their feet through the rest of his possessions, a half empty bottle of vodka, a pack of smokes and a long sheathed knife. One of the men drew it, the shining metal glinting in the light. The boy sneered with hate, but remained stubbornly silent.
&#8216;Is this yours boy?&#8217; the man drawled.
He did not reply, one of the other men jabbed him hard in his empty stomach and he crumbled downwards onto his knees.
&#8216;Do you speak English?&#8217;
He looked away into the night, avoiding them all. One of the men fiercely struck him around the back of his head. He winced and turned sharply around, &#8216;Yes, I speak English,&#8217; he said, clear in his voice he did not speak it naturally. &#8216;The knife is mine.&#8217;
&#8216;Where did you get it?&#8217; the man holding the knife asked, he was clearly the leader out of the three of them, the other holding the torch, and the other gripping firmly his shoulders.
&#8216;It&#8217;s mine, what more does it matter?&#8217;
&#8216;Did you steal it?&#8217;
The boy glared at him, then licked his lips as if about to say something, but thought better of it.
&#8216;You&#8217;re Giacomo Morana the thief aren&#8217;t you?&#8217;
His silence they took to be positive.
&#8216;This knife is our boss&#8217;,&#8217; the leader declared.
A look of panic passed over his features, &#8216;Your boss is Alexei Skyros?&#8217;
&#8216;Ah, so you did steal it. You make our boss very annoyed. This is a very fine knife.&#8217; With a swift movement the leader placed the knife against Giacomo&#8217;s neck. He gasped and tried to move away, but the other man held him tight. &#8216;Come quietly, or I shall stain this blade,&#8217; the man threatened.
They tied his hands and feet and pulled him up, forcing him shuffle along. They passed a girl in the alleyway, dressed in a tight glitzy dress. She passed Giacomo one of those smiles that he knew she was laughing at his misfortune, and he stared back, only to be yanked violently on and forwards. On they went, and every face he saw a silent smile was thrown away, until they came to the doors that guarded the halls of the great Alexei Skyros the Greek. Giacomo gulped at the sight knowing entering as a captive man, he would never leave as a free one.
&#8216;Ah!&#8217; Alexei boomed from his throne in the centre of the hall. His house went on for miles, the hall was big enough in itself, a secret mansion in the heart of West London with swirling stairs and a chequer board floor in marble. Lining the tiles in chaise lounges lay girls of all ethnicities draped in cooling organza that only made their visible nakedness the more desirable to touch. More women lay up against the walls, dancing to a slow and steady beat of a drum, their hips undulating while all around incense sticks billowed out great fumes of patchouli. Giacomo could not help but stare, and already he could feel his erection fighting against his ill fitting trousers. Desperately he fought to get it down, envisioning his grandmother naked on a toilet, it subsided, but only to be distracted by another beauty.
He looked up at the end of the room where Alexei Skyros sat, the fat man, his bulging tummy sitting over a pair of tight fitting leather trousers and some heavy boots. Across his knees rested a topped cane. His chest was a mass of curly black hair, his beard sharp and pointy, and his long black hair upon his head slicked back into a tight ponytail. They called him the Greek God, though God never favoured him in looks or stature, but he was a master of women, what did he care for looks. On either side of him stood a pair of guards dressed in smart black suits, just like the ones dragging him into the hall, much to the amusement of the women who smiled and laughed at his suffering. He was thrown unceremoniously to the floor before Alexei Skyros and left lying there, his hands strapped firmly behind his back, the skin already sore.
&#8216;You&#8217;ve looked better Giacomo,&#8217; Alexei laughed. &#8216;The infamous Giacomo the wop, London&#8217;s most wanted beggar, and now all for me. You&#8217;ve done well boys,&#8217; he said to the three men, &#8216;Take your pick of a woman and enjoy the rest of the evening.&#8217;
Graciously they bowed and thanked before moving off into the room to select the lady of their choice.
&#8216;Come closer Giacomo, I want you to clean my boots with your tongue.&#8217;
&#8216;Alexei?&#8217; he asked shocked.
The pimp took his cane off his lap and smashed it hard across Giacomo&#8217;s face. &#8216;Alexei!&#8217; he shouted, &#8216;Don&#8217;t you see what position you are in boy? No position to call me Alexei! I was told you were intelligent!&#8217;
By the force he was thrown across the ground, whimpering and bleeding, his mouth filling up fast while his cheek felt disconnected. &#8216;I&#8217;m sorry... sir,&#8217; he choked. Alexei squeezed the cane tighter in his fingers. &#8216;I&#8217;m sorry master,&#8217; he desperately corrected, but the word left a chilling feeling over his skin. He struggled back to his knees and feebly stuck his tongue out to place at the side of his master&#8217;s boots, then ferociously began&nbsp; to lick, desperate for no more pain. Feeling was returning to his face and it hurt even more.
&#8216;Very good,&#8217; Alexei smiled as he watched the pleasing submission, &#8216;We&#8217;ll make some good out of you yet.&#8217;
&#8216;Please master,&#8217; Giacomo whispered, raising his head from his duties momentarily, &#8216;What is it that you plan to do with me?&#8217;
Grinning Alexei ran his boot down Giacomo&#8217;s sore cheek coating the burning flesh with his own saliva. &#8216;Do you not notice, despite all these gorgeous women, I am lacking a male to my selection?&#8217;
&#8216;A prostitute,&#8217; he said hoarsely. &#8216;Will I be made to lie with men?&#8217;
The room filled with laughter and Giacomo blushed, he felt foul enough amongst these beautiful women, and for them to laugh at him, the humiliation.
&#8216;Of course we need to trial you first. Andy, untie him,&#8217; he instructed one of the guards. Andy stepped forwards and began to loosen the ties, discarding the rope to the floor and smartly stepped back into position. &#8216;Strip,&#8217; Alexei ordered.
Giacomo hesitated for too long at that command. Andy drew a whip out and sprang it hard down his body, sheering off the clothes and cutting the flesh beneath. Giacomo cried and desperately took his dirty rags off standing there naked as the day he was born in front of a row of fully dressed men and a room of beautiful women. He wanted to curl up, his erection on the other hand didn&#8217;t. Without the clothes he had a highly attractive body, slim and well built, a tight backside, muscular legs and a powerful chest, his arms sinewy with veins as much as his engorged manhood.
&#8216;Impressive,&#8217; Alexei complimented, &#8216;But let&#8217;s have that in inches shall we Andy?&#8217;
Andy marched forwards and drew a ruler out of his pocket. Giacomo began to back away, but as soon as Andy withdrew his whip, he stood stock still. Without any qualms the henchman grabbed his balls and weighed them considerably in hands. A sickened expression past over Giacomo&#8217;s lips and his penis began to retreat. He met the eyes of Andy who was giving him a curious glare and then slowly started to stroke his manhood into full erection, snapping the ruler against it.
&#8216;Nine inches sir,&#8217; he declared, and snapped back to his standard position 
&#8216;Good, now masturbate slave.&#8217;
It took another lick of the whip for Giacomo to comprehend what was being said to him. He looked around at the women for inspiration, and then began to furiously pump to the inspection of Alexei and his men. He could feel himself tighten up. He was going to blow any moment now.
&#8216;Stop!&#8217; Alexei ordered.
Giacomo stared back shock, so lost had he been in his self satisfaction, and now on the brink, he was only to be denied.
&#8216;But Master!&#8217; he cried.
Andy struck the whip at him again. Giacomo winced and fell back down to the floor, his balls thudding for release.
&#8216;You shall learn slave that what you do is for my pleasure and the pleasure of the customers alone, not yourself, never yourself. However, it would please me to see you cum over yourself. Lie on your back slave!&#8217;
Cringing, Giacomo laid down on the freezing tiles, the cold sending shivers down his spine and began to continue. It didn&#8217;t take long till like a fountain his balls contracted and creamy white sprouted forth covering his cold yet sweating body. It flew into his eyes and spattered across his heaving chest. A giggle came from the observing women.
&#8216;Now clean it up.&#8217;
Giacomo looked up, &#8216;May I have a cloth please master.&#8217;
General laughter broke out and Giacomo reddened. This was frustrating. &#8216;Don&#8217;t you have a tongue boy?&#8217; Alexei laughed, &#8216;Now lick!&#8217;
One look at Andy who was curling the whip in his hands made him realise he had no chance, and scraping the spunk off his chest with his hands, put his head down and began to drink. He wanted to be sick. The salty gunk, still warm that tasted of him, filled up his mouth like glue, refusing to go down. He began to cry, yet continued, now licking the floor, his face a boiling red. When he finished he lay there panting.
&#8216;Well done slave,&#8217; Alexei said, &#8216;You&#8217;ll be a good one. You,&#8217; he pointed at a petite African. &#8216;Take him away to be fitted up.&#8217;
She bowed and helped Giacomo to his feet, guiding him out of the room, he was still sobbing. &#8216;There, there,&#8217; she comforted.
&#8216;What&#8217;s happening?&#8217;
&#8216;Silly, you know what&#8217;s happening, you said so yourself, Master Alexei wants you as a prostitute.&#8217;
&#8216;Just... just like you?&#8217;
&#8216;Yes, just like me. I&#8217;m Opal by the way.&#8217;
&#8216;Is that your real name?&#8217;
She pulled a funny face, &#8216;No it&#8217;s not, it&#8217;s what Master named me.&#8217;
&#8216;What&#8217;s your real name?&#8217;
&#8216;Opal, slave,&#8217; she insisted. &#8216;I don&#8217;t want to remember what it was before, it makes me sad.&#8217;
&#8216;Because you were free then?&#8217; Giacomo asked.
&#8216;Perhaps, but this is my life now. In here.&#8217; She guided him into a dark room, a rack lying in the centre, restraints hanging at each end and an old man dressed in an apron holding a long sharp needle.
&#8216;No!&#8217; Giacomo cried and tried to run away but Opal grabbed him, she was stronger than her height suggested, and forced him roughly into the room. The old man came forwards and shifted him up onto the rack while he buckled and fought. They strapped him down, metal shackles on his ankles, on his wrists, but he could still writhe about. They pulled a thick leather strap around his waist, buckling him firmly down, and another around his neck.
&#8216;He&#8217;s a feisty one,&#8217; the old man commented.
&#8216;He&#8217;s a thief who stole from Master Alexei,&#8217; Opal replied ignoring his cries. She pressed a finger to his nipples, and then to his nose and lips. Her touches seemed gentle and almost erotic when she placed a finger just above his penis. &#8216;He wants the mark placed there,&#8217; she said, &#8216;and probably two in the mouth.&#8217;
&#8216;Two in the mouth,&#8217; Giacomo cried out, &#8216;What does that mean?&#8217;
&#8216;Silence,&#8217; Opal commanded. &#8216;I want you to stick out your tongue.&#8217;
&#8216;Why?&#8217;
&#8216;Slave, if you do not comply I will be forced to beat you.&#8217;
Giacomo was sure she would, so obediently he stuck out his tongue, only for it to be clamped hard in a vice. He wanted to cry out, but he was silenced. He tried to retract his tongue, but the clamp was bigger than his mouth. Through his watery eyes, he watched Opal nod and a flash of metal shone above him. Oh God no, he thought to himself and dug his nails into the wood. He felt something sharp on his tongue, and then slip through the sensitive flesh, the agony, he felt like he was going to explode. The sharp thing was removed, only to be replaced by a hard lump, and then, it happened again, but this time closer to the tip of the tongue. The pain was fiery. Would he ever be able to taste again, to talk properly again? His tongue felt so heavy in his mouth when the clamp was moved, curling up into the recesses of his lips, frightened by this torture.
Something cold pressed against the centre structure of his nostrils. Giacomo flicked open his eyes, then shut them tight again, he was going to have a piercing in his nose. He was going to look like a pig, or a cow! He heard more than felt the cartilage crack as the needle went through it. &#8216;Something heavy I think,&#8217; he heard Opal say, &#8216;would certainly make him bow his head.&#8217; He felt his nose being tugged and something large round and heavy resting on his top lips. It was tugged again and Giacomo opened his eyes to see a large brass ring obscuring his lower vision, and Opal was attaching a leash to it.
&#8216;Last two,&#8217; she said cheerfully, &#8216;And then your tattoo.&#8217; She smiled as his eyes bulged open in shock. &#8216;Don&#8217;t worry,&#8217; she calmly said, &#8216;We&#8217;ve all had this done, see,&#8217; she pushed open her organza wrap to show her shaved pussy, and above it the insignia of Alexei Skyros. In an arch above the top was written OPAL. She saw where Giacomo was looking. &#8216;You&#8217;ll get a name too,&#8217; she assured.
Giacomo weakly tried to say something, fortunately Opal had some idea what he was trying to communicate.
&#8216;Mayo, I think, that&#8217;s what he told me.&#8217;
Again, some more mumbles.
&#8216;What&#8217;s the matter with Giacomo?&#8217; she laughed, &#8216;Weren&#8217;t you listening to me. Giacomo was your name beyond these walls, but you&#8217;re not part of that world any more. Here, as a treat I&#8217;ll let you chose which rings you want on your nipples.&#8217;
Giacomo didn&#8217;t want nipple rings or a name like a condiment, he didn&#8217;t want to be sleeping on the streets any more either, but then he thought this was possibly one of his better options. A lot of bosses wanted him gone, especially the vicious American, Lars Mannis. Lars would want him dead. Alexei just wants to fuck him. Maybe Alexei would let him go if him go if he behaved well, in behaving well, Giacomo guessed that would mean suffering for his pleasure. He indicated through a series of nods and grunts the large brass rings which would match his nose ring.
As soon as the old man finished inking the insignia just above his groin he was taken off the table, more placated now and led by that nose ring over to a table. A mirror was on the opposite wall and Giacomo turned to admire himself, if that was him staring back. The nipple rings were all ready beginning to thud, but his nose ring, the weight of it insured that he could barely lift his head, a constant tear jerker. They had shaved away his pubic hair, all of it, his penis looked naked, more naked than it had looked since he was a little boy. Fortunately his Mamma could not see him. Above the insignia there was MAYO written. It would take a while to get used to that part. Opal reached up and strapped a hard leather collar around his neck, it was constricting to a certain extent, but then that was its purpose to remind him who his life belonged to. Opal strapped similar leather restraints around his ankles and wrists and tied all four together with a loose chain that scraped across the floor as he was led by his nose ring.
To his surprise Opal began to stroke his cock in her soft brown hands, erecting his previously deflated manhood, smooth soft strokes and scratches with manicured nails. Soon it was standing to attention. She snapped a cock ring on much to Giacomo&#8217;s disappointment, his cock trapped in erection.
&#8216;There Mayo,&#8217; she smiled, &#8216;You&#8217;re all ready.&#8217;
Opal picked up the leash and dragged Giacomo behind her, stumbling and rustling in his chains, the tug of his nostrils bringing sharp tears to his eyes. They walked back through the endless corridors to the main hall, almost happy he had Opal leading him because on his own he knew he would get lost, and soon he saw the glow of the room in the corridor and heard the rhythmic beating of the drums. They stopped as soon as Opal and the slave entered the room again.



&#8216;Ah hah!&#8217; Alexei clapped his hands gleefully, &#8216;What have we here, a transformation! Oh and the nose ring!&#8217; he took the leash off Opal and dragged Giacomo towards him, his fresh piercing screaming in pain. Alexei forced him to his feet, gripping his head between his leather clod thighs. &#8216;What an exquisite adornment! You do have taste Opal, real taste. Maybe we should call him piglet instead. Would you like that slave? Hmmm, you probably can&#8217;t answer me, can you? Open your mouth.&#8217;
Giacomo did as he was told and revealed the heavy gold bars, one at the tip and one in the middle.
&#8216;Two, Opal?&#8217; Alexei asked.
&#8216;He wouldn&#8217;t stop crying, some extra silence I thought would be a godsend.&#8217;
Patronisingly Alexei stroked his hair, &#8216;Are you a little crybaby Mayo? Hmmm? Do you like your new name, I thought of it before capturing you, like Mayo the wop, you know the film I&#8217;m talking about?&#8217;
Giacomo tried to nod, his eyes brimming with tears, but Alexei was holding him too tight for any significant movement to become apparent.
&#8216;Ah, the little cry baby,&#8217; Alexei cooed.
&#8216;Master,&#8217; Opal said, &#8216;The boy is only fifteen years old.&#8217;
&#8216;Weren&#8217;t we all once?&#8217; Alexei replied harshly. &#8216;Stand up slave,&#8217; he ordered relaxing his legs. Giacomo did as he was told, his engorged penis resting just above his Master&#8217;s knee. &#8216;What do you think to piercing his penis, Opal?&#8217;
&#8216;He would be out of action for sex for quite a while.&#8217;
&#8216;Yes, but he could continue pleasuring orally, do the housework as well. I think it would be quite fun to see him running around in a latex dress, little high heels. I would like something that is sexually stimulating for his partner, but painful to him, and you could also attach a leash to it and drag him around, rather like his nose ring, but for his dick.&#8217;
&#8216;How about a Prince Albert, Master? They don&#8217;t take too long to heal, and I&#8217;ve also seen them be used as a chastity device as well.&#8217;
&#8216;Hmm, that would be interesting.&#8217;
Giacomo listened to them in fear, his penis wanted to curl away in disgust but could not because of the vicious device holding it in place. He felt Alexei hold his penis and study it thoughtfully. &#8216;Yes,&#8217; he mused, &#8216;That could work, see it done tomorrow Opal.&#8217;
Opal curtseyed, &#8216;Yes Master, but why not tonight.&#8217;
&#8216;Because I thought you might like to have him for yourself tonight. Would you not like him for a night?&#8217;
&#8216;Oh yes Master!&#8217; she kissed his hand and pressed it against his face. &#8216;You are so good to me.&#8217;
&#8216;See slave,&#8217; Alexei said to Giacomo, &#8216;If you do as I command, and if you think beyond my command to my liking, you will receive a prize. I am a very good master am I not?&#8217;
&#8216;Yesh Mushtar.&#8217;
&#8216;Adorable is it not after they get their tongue pierced? Now, let&#8217;s admire these nipple rings of yours. Once again I compliment your choice Opal.&#8217;
&#8216;Oh no Master, Mayo chose those.&#8217;
&#8216;Really?&#8217; Alexei grinned, &#8216;Do you like pain slave?&#8217; he grinned and took one of the rings in his mouth, tugging it with his teeth. Giacomo winced.
&#8216;I wuntud ta pleece thu Mushtar.&#8217;
&#8216;You wanted to please me slave? What a fast learner, even better than I thought.&#8217;
He handed the leash back to Opal who grinned at the opportunity. &#8216;On your knees slave,&#8217; Opal ordered.
Giacomo dropped to the floor, hands and knees as best he could, the chains stopping most of the movement. Opal marched off and Giacomo did as best he could to keep up with her steps. She smiled at him, she could see he was struggling, but she wasn&#8217;t going to slow down. She like the sound the desperate clinking of his chains on the floor and his futile breathing. The heavily weighted nipple rings were stretching, the pain agonising on his chest, but the pain in his cock subsided, he was finding this so sexy, or maybe it was admiring her bare backside tantalisingly visible through the shimmering organza. He had never really taken much note of how beautiful she was yet, an absolute perfect body, long shining black hair, slightly muscular legs, and her breasts, he loved the way they strained at the fabric. Around her ankles and wrists she had leather cuffs too, adorned with little bells and trinkets that tinkled as she walked. She dragged him into another room, an entertaining room for the lesser customers. There was a bed, a selection of toys and whips and a cage in the corner of the room. The mattress was thin and was covered with some blankets all threadbare and a solitary light swung from the ceiling. Giacomo looked around at the surroundings and shivered with fear.
&#8216;Whaddya gunna doth wammie?&#8217;
&#8216;Nothing really, unless you want me to do something. Spending my days doing nothing but having sex the last thing I want to do is have some sex in my free time. I was just going to lie on my bed and watch some TV.&#8217; She opened up a cupboard facing the bed revealing a very old looking set and turned it on. There was some rom-com on, typical American flashy stuff, everyone was overly pretty, unless they were a nerd, in which case they were still pretty, only dressed up to look dumb. Giacomo stood by the door and waited patiently for her command, watching her sigh and roll in the bed. She noticed him looking and unravelled the organza toga, passing the warm fabric to Giacomo. He held it in his hands, smelling her perfume, then slowly began to wrap it up. Opal reached into the wardrobe beside the TV and took out a velvet dressing gown, wrapping it tightly around her, then lay back down on the bed.
&#8216;Be a dear Mayo and fetch me a cup of coco,&#8217; she sighed as she carried on watching the TV.
Giacomo did not move. Opal glared at him. &#8216;I...donth nowa tha kutchin ith,&#8217; he mumbled. Opal gave him some instructions and he left closing the door behind him, clanking down the corridor, his bondage really become too much for him to bear. He found the kitchens at last, a cellar deep within the mansion. A warm range stood against the wall in one corner and a large table filled up the centre. Pans and saucepans were dotted around the place, but everything was deserted save for a young girl dressed in a clumsy slip. Her blonde hair was messy and filled with flour dust, but she had sharp blue eyes that caught Giacomo as soon as he walked in.
&#8216;Hello,&#8217; she said.
&#8216;Hulloth,&#8217; Giacomo tried to reply, &#8216;I&#8217;m-&#8217;
&#8216;Mayo, yeah, talk of the house you are. How can help you, or are you just lost. I&#8217;m not allowed to feed you any food before you ask, Master Alexei won&#8217;t allow me, wants you nice and weak, easier to break he says. Probably shouldn&#8217;t have said that should I.&#8217;
&#8216;Opfal vud like a hot hocklet.&#8217;
&#8216;Oh Opal,&#8217; the girl sighed, &#8216;She that whispers in Alexei&#8217;s ear. You better watch out for her the little minx.&#8217; She turned away to put the kettle on. &#8216;So you just got your tongue done then?&#8217;
&#8216;Yesh.&#8217;
The girl grinned, &#8216;Yeah I remember when I got mine done, couldn&#8217;t talk, couldn&#8217;t eat, everyone just laughed at me. You&#8217;re doing well you know. I&#8217;m Kate by the way, no flash names like Mayo or Opal.&#8217;
&#8216;Itsh Vacomo really.&#8217;
&#8216;Yes, but I can&#8217;t be caught calling you by your real name.&#8217;
&#8216;Why dontsh you have a derrent name?&#8217;
&#8216;Because I&#8217;m not pretty enough.&#8217;
Giacomo reached out and touched her creamy white cheek, tucking the hairs out of the way. She stopped in her actions, staring at his disfigured face in shock. &#8216;I thinksh ya pretty,&#8217; he said.
Kate pushed his hand away, &#8216;We&#8217;d both get whipped for flirty little comments like that, but if you must know, Master Alexei called me average.&#8217;
&#8216;Why are thu har ven ish hay donsch wano?&#8217;
&#8216;Because I&#8217;m his property. Do you think any of us are here by choice? Master Alexei wants me in the kitchens, I&#8217;m in the kitchens whether I like it or not.&#8217; The kettle boiled to a close and Kate handed him the cup of hot chocolate. &#8216;See you soon Mayo.&#8217;
Giacomo stumbled out of the kitchens and back down the corridor praying that he would be able to find Opal&#8217;s room again. He did, and she was lying on the bed still firmly tied up in her velvet dressing gown. Something exciting must be happening in the film because she flustered him in and did not take her eyes off the TV. Giacomo put her cup on the side and knelt by her bed, not really watching the TV, just her expression. The break came up and she turned to look at him, his eyes wide with devotion.
&#8216;Come slave,&#8217; she said, getting off the bed. &#8216;Lie down, yes, head at the other end, and tuck your knees into your chest and put your legs upright.&#8217;
&#8216;Like tish Opfel?&#8217;
&#8216;Yes, now deep breath.&#8217; She straddled his body, her back against his shins like she was sitting in a chair. She lifted her dressing gown exposing her pussy to Giacomo&#8217;s face, then dropped it back down so it engulfed him in darkness, warm and fragrant. She shifted around a bit until her vulva rested upon his lips while his nose just jutted outside allowing him to breathe. Knowing what was expected of him he stuck his tongue out and gently began to lick her folds, but she slapped his penis. 
&#8216;No slave, I don&#8217;t want to cum yet, I&#8217;m trying to watch a film. There&#8217;s at least another hour to go.&#8217; Giacomo winced at the thought, she was surprisingly heavy on his face and he was so tired he was afraid he may fall asleep. He felt his eyes closed as he struggled to breath, the ring in his nostrils not allowing much passage for air. His lips felt damp and sweaty where her skin came into contact with him, he could smell her warm juices and feel them on his chin. He heard the film play, their voices sound muffled, and Opal laughed and giggled, then glugged her hot chocolate down. Suddenly there was light and Giacomo looked up to see the base of two round caramel breasts. Opal smiled and took the leash off his nose ring and slowly began to rub her pussy up and down his face using his nose as a stimulant to her clit. He could feel it growing and could smell the musky whiff, his face becoming lubricated with her juices. He dug his tongue between her folds feeling the barbell tug on the flesh, she writhed in pleasure grabbing at his hair with her manicured fingernails and drove harder. She pushed her whole body weight down upon his face. He couldn&#8217;t breathe, he couldn&#8217;t see, he began to struggle, and then for a moment she lifted up. He took a gasp, and she plunged back down again. Fiercely she rocked back and forth ignoring his cries of agonising pain as she threatened to tear his nose ring out, and then she came with a freeze, a shudder, and a satisfied ah. She leant back on the bed, watching him gasp and choke and cry for air, his nose red raw and his skin glistening with her juices.
&#8216;There, there slave,&#8217; she cooed, running a foot up and down his trembling body, &#8216;You pleased me, and in pleasing me you pleased Master Alexei, is that not what you want?&#8217;
&#8216;Yesh Mish,&#8217; he coughed.
Opal stretched her toes out and placed them in his mouth. Gently he began to suck at them, his embellished tongue tickling them slightly. Opal giggled and pushed her toes in deeper. Giacomo tried hard to desperately please her, but his tongue felt so heavy and sore, the piercings clamping it down. She did not seem to notice though.
&#8216;Have you done that before slave?&#8217;
&#8216;Yesh Mish.&#8217;
&#8216;I thought you could not be a virgin you were too good. You&#8217;re settling in very well. Now slave, would you like sex, or would you prefer to sleep?&#8217;
What an ultimatum Giacomo thought as he tried to suck on her toes with all her might. On one hand he could barely stay awake, on the other he knew that this would be his last chance to have sex for a while, and even longer with Opal. He pulled his mouth away from her big toe. &#8216;Sheks pleesh, if itsh not too much cha asksh.&#8217;
&#8216;Of course you want sex, slave, and not too much to ask at all, our little session then got me quite heated up, but I don&#8217;t want you to have all the fun. Kneel up and give us your wrists.&#8217;
Giacomo did as he was told holding out his chained wrists before him. Opal undid the links, then pushed his hands behind his back, this time linking them together with less chain. A long length of unwanted chain dangled out behind him which Opal pulled up, stretching his arms up behind him, pushing him forwards, and then attached the chain to a hook from the ceiling, locking him in agony. Opal smiled and ran a soft hand down his back falling into a kneeling position behind him, gently fondling his palpitating chest. She rested her head between his arms on his back and licked the first forms of sweat away from him while he shivered under her electric touch. Her hands touched his nipple rings and tugged on them lightly making him wince and then groan with pleasure as she began stroke and caress them. Like a snake she coiled around his body, now facing him and reached down to give his lips a soft kiss become stronger and stronger, now locking in embrace, he felt her tongue, studded two knock against his, the barbells twisting and dancing around each other. She didn&#8217;t let go. Giacomo didn&#8217;t want her to stop, her soft fingers still massaging his swollen nipples. He wanted to touch hers, to stroke her back to run his hands through her black hair, but all he could do was rattle the chain that kept him bent over, submissive to her devises as she teased him.
She pulled her lips away and giggled as Giacomo tried to reach out and keep them in contact, but started to moan as his arms buckled with the strain. To his joy though Opal slipped off her dressing gown, his face inches from her large round breasts. Eagerly he bent down to try and suckle at them, but she was sat too far back, they were literally on the tip of his tongue. He reached forwards, the pain in his shoulder reaching to unbelievable pressures and took a quick lick before being forced to retreat. &#8216;Again slave,&#8217; she commanded. Giacomo cried out at the exertion, but tried again, shifting his knees forwards until he was on their tips, leaning forwards as far as he dare without dislocating his arms, and began to suck, his piercings tinkling against her own. Opal ran her fingers through his curly black hair, and then suddenly slapped his face away.
He gasped and knelt back into a more comfortable position, but his breath still laboured. Opal bent over, positioning herself underneath his body and order him to make love to her. Struggling Giacomo shifted forwards, stumbling trying to get his cock to go in. Exasperated Opal reached behind her and grabbing it firmly, pushed it in and slid deep down onto his shaft. Giacomo moaned at the sensation, and then slowly and awkwardly began to move his hips back and forth.
&#8216;Faster slave!&#8217; she demanded.
Desperately Giacomo tried to comply, buckling at her behind. He felt himself tingle with anticipation, but tried to pull himself back, he had to pull himself back for her. Though he wanted the pain to stop, she wanted the pleasure to continue. He pushed himself into a frenzy, jerking her back and forth. She screamed in ecstasy, goading him on. &#8216;Faster slave! Faster!&#8217; she cried. The sensations were mounting, he felt her tense, and then her rocketing spasms sent him into orgasm. He gasped and collapsed on her back, feeling her sweat stick to his skin, she felt so warm and alive.
She pulled out and shoved her pussy in his face, &#8216;Lick it out slave,&#8217; she commanded, &#8216;I don&#8217;t want your worthless sperm inside me.&#8217; Giacomo complied and reached forwards sucking and nibbling at her red sensitive flesh, tasting himself for the second time that evening. Was it always going to be like this, forever tasting his own fluids through some means or another? He sucked harder, slurping it all up. &#8216;Done Mish!&#8217; he said.
&#8216;Good boy,&#8217; Opal rolled on her back and put her toes back into his mouth. Desperate for relief Giacomo went back to licking them, though he wished she would let him out of this cruel torture. &#8216;I&#8217;ll tell Master Alexei you&#8217;ve been good. He&#8217;ll like that. Good slaves have a good life, bad slaves have a bad life. You&#8217;ll enjoy your time here far more if you&#8217;ve been a good slave. Now let&#8217;s get you out of this and get you to bed.&#8217; She unhooked the chain connecting his arms to the ceiling and released his wrists. Instantly he clutched them to his chest, rocking on his knees, trying to return the feeling. Gently Opal touched his soft black hair, trailing her finger down his cheek and kissed his lips, wrapping her arms around him and drawing him down onto the bed, holding his face to her chest. &#8216;That was real,&#8217; she whispered.
Giacomo held her back, running a hand down her body, desperately trying not to cry. &#8216;Yesterday,&#8217; he reminisced, &#8216;I was savaging in a bin of this rich person&#8217;s house. I found some papers, everything I needed for an identity, and tomorrow I was going to go to a friend and become a new man, but it happened today instead, and tomorrow they&#8217;re going to put a hole in my dick.&#8217; He lifted his head from her breasts, &#8216;Please Opal,&#8217; he begged, &#8216;I like it the way it is.&#8217;
&#8216;It&#8217;s not yours anymore,&#8217; she placed a hand around one of her breasts, massaging it and lolling around her chest. &#8216;This might be attached to my body, but if Master Alexei no longer wants me to have breasts, who am I to complain, they are his breasts.&#8217;
&#8216;So, this is Master Alexei&#8217;s dick?&#8217;
&#8216;Yes.&#8217;
&#8216;But this,&#8217; Giacomo knelt up, straddling Opal&#8217;s chest, and pointed to his head, &#8216;My brain, that can&#8217;t belong to him, neither can my pride or identity.&#8217;
&#8216;Your pride and your identity,&#8217; Opal laughed, &#8216;Let me hear you talk about pride after your little operation tomorrow, and you said so yourself, you do have a new identity. Your name is Mayo.&#8217;
&#8216;I will always think of myself as my real name. Do you think of yourself as Opal, just a brain inside another person&#8217;s body, or do you think of yourself as whatever your mother called you.&#8217;
&#8216;Mayo,&#8217; Opal said tersely, &#8216;I think you&#8217;ve said enough now. Get up, I need to put you to bed.&#8217;
&#8216;No please,&#8217; he cried, &#8216;can&#8217;t I stay with you?&#8217;
&#8216;No you&#8217;re being very rude. Why are you so interested in my name?&#8217;
Giacomo shrugged, &#8216;Why are you so secretive about it?&#8217;
Sharply Opal slapped him hard across his cheek. Giacomo cried out and was thrown across the bed, knocking his head into the wall. When he opened his eyes, Opal was glaring at him, but it was not his eyes watering, it was hers. She grabbed him roughly by the hair, dragging him off the bed and over her knees, exposing his bare backside. He watched her take something short and wiry off the wall behind her, and he knew he was for it.
The bite of the first hit was so extreme he almost leapt off her lap, but she ignored his cries and moans and carried on while he blubbered away. He could feel the skin break, the hot blood rush through, but she didn&#8217;t stop. Would she ever? &#8216;Please Miss!&#8217; he begged, &#8216;I&#8217;m sorry! Please forgive me!&#8217; Satisfied, Opal stopped and ran a hand over his backside, rubbing the blood in.
&#8216;Have you learnt your lesson slave?&#8217;
&#8216;Yes Miss!&#8217;
&#8216;On your knees then.&#8217;
Giacomo instantly dropped down to the floor, Opal&#8217;s pedicured feet before him. It only felt natural to lower his head and thank her like she seems to enjoy. He kissed her toes, trying to please her, but when he looked up, she was staring back down at him, an eyebrow raised, questioning if he had finished yet. Taking him by the hair once more she led him over to the cage and bundled him in, locking the door with a heavy padlock. Giacomo enclosed his fingers around the frame work, staring out from within his prison.
Opal got down upon her knees before him looking him straight in the eye. &#8216;Do I need to tell Master Alexei about this?&#8217;
&#8216;No Miss.&#8217;
&#8216;Because you won&#8217;t do it again right?&#8217;
&#8216;No Miss.&#8217;
Opal inserted a finger through one of the holes and kindly tucked back a stray hair on Giacomo&#8217;s face. &#8216;You spoke of identity,&#8217; she sighed, &#8216;And you&#8217;re right about me just being a brain in another body, I am, he&#8217;s taken everything away from me, but what he can&#8217;t take is the memory of my past life, of my name. It&#8217;s very personal to me, do you understand that, something so personal, I&#8217;m not ready to share it to you. They&#8217;ve taken so much away from me, I don&#8217;t want them to take any more.&#8217; She leant through the bars and kissed his forehead. &#8216;Goodnight Giacomo,&#8217; she whispered, &#8216;I think I may the first of many to love you.&#8217;
And with that she turned out the lights.
