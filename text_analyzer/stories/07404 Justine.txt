Synopsis: 






Justine had always known she was strange. She was diminutive, only four feet six tall, but her tits had always looked too nig for her. 36D on such a small frame always made sure she got started at. She had dated. Many times. But never dated the same man more than three nights. If they wanted sex, they could have it, if they didn&#8217;t, it didn&#8217;t matter to her. She never got anything from it anyway. Her only orgasms had come at her own hands. She even let men arse fuck her, as that was supposed to be sexier, but it had made no difference.

She had read the story of Catherine on line, and even without touching herself, she had had four orgasms. What a story. A girl get changed beyond anything they could have expected, and was turned into a slut lave. She read the story at least a dozen times.

Catherine&#8217;s nipples had been covered by metal tips, giving her one inch nipples. Her pussy and been stretched, though it didn&#8217;t say how much by, and would never close again. Her clit had also been covered by a metal nub, meaning the only sex Catherine would ever actually enjoy, would be anal or oral.

Justine had never, as yet, sucked a cock, and anal sex didn&#8217;t actually do anything for her. To lose her pussy and arse was no big deal. To force her to use her mouth alone, was. 

She had studied the story, and thought �what if I could make that machine, and make it so I could never have sex again. Never gain satisfaction. Would I be as wet as Catherine?�

The story had given a lot of detail, and Justine knew she could re-create what she had read. But, more debilitating. Why simply lose the pussy, when you can lose the arse as well? Why lose nipples, when the whole tit can be hidden forever?

It would take some effort, but Justine was convinced she could do it. And wouldn&#8217;t it be nice to report that the fictional ideas, could become a reality?

It took seven month of hard graft to perfect her machine, which she called the Magician. She called it that, because Justine would enter it, but she had no idea who, or what, would come out if it, but it would not be Justine.

She had no way of getting the anaesthetic Catherine had used, but she could handle the aphrodisiac. Ground viagra, boiled up, and added to orange jelly, would provide the gel . but it would not stop the pain. That was something Justine would have to endure. There was no other way. She already knew it was going to be very painful, but she had no other choice. Catherine&#8217;s machine was run by a computer, and Justine&#8217;s was going to follow suit. She also wrote the program so that no matter what she said, or did, once it started, it would not stop until the job was finished. By then, Justine would be changed, forever. She knew that if she did this, there was no way back. It was deliberate, and permanent.

She looked at the Magician and smiled. It had taken a lot of hard work to complete the machine, and she knew that once she gave herself to it, she was accepting her fate. It was af fate she was happy to accept. The end of her sex life, not that she would miss that. But she would still be able to function as a normal human being, still be able to work, still be able to do most of the things everyone else could do. Though she would not be able to sunbather topless, she would not be able to do team sports, or anything that meant shared public facilities.

Not that any of that mattered. Catherine, in the story, had contacted several people by email. Offering herself to the first taker. That had appealed to Justine. Not knowing who would come for her. She scoured the sites for what she was looking for. She didn&#8217;t want some namby pamby to come for her. What she was doing to herself would be brutal, and irreversible. She wanted someone who could and would be brutal to her later. This was a conscious decision, and her computer was set to send emails as soon as the Magician finished it&#8217;s work.

Catherine had done her stuff in two separate visits to her machine. Justine wanted it all done at a single visit. Just in case, after the first one, she bottled out. It had to be all. Or nothing as far as Justine was concerned, and once the Magician started, it would be all.

She checked a few things to make sure they would work as she wanted, she didn&#8217;t want mistakes, and she didn&#8217;t want equipment failures half way through. The machine would take it&#8217;s time doing it&#8217;s jobs, but she wanted to know that it wouldn&#8217;t fail through anything she had done.

The one thing she had no control over, was a random setting within the Magician. The size her pussy would open to, and stay open. There were three tension rings holding the dildo closed at the moment. A small pressure pad at the base, would release one of the tension springs. Only the Magician knew which one. Regardless, she knew that she would never be able to use a tampon ever again. The smallest tension ring would open her pussy a full two inches, the second would be half an inch more, and the third, would leave her wide open a full three inches. No cock would ever touch the sides, and no tampon would ever fit. She had bought rubber pants from the internet which she would wear, with a pad, when required. If, she suddenly thought, her new owner allowed her to do.

That was the other thing she had no control over. The email would give personal details, name, address, and tell them where the key to her door was hidden, so they could get into the house and claim their prize. It seemed odd considering herself as their prize. But that is exactly what she would be. And there would be nothing she could do about it. She had made sure of that.

The Magician was ready for her, waiting for Justine to give herself to it. And she would. But first, she needed to get fucked for the last time. She would still, hopefully, have the guy&#8217;s juices inside her when she started the machine. Not that it mattered, the dildo&#8217;s were both self lubricating, and she guessed that the viagara would also serve a purpose and make her wet. 

It wasn&#8217;t for that purpose she wanted sex. It was simply so she could remember why she was giving it up, why she was destroying all chances of ever having it again. And by the time the Magician had worked his magic, that would be it for her.

The guy she had arranged to meet was someone she met down the pub the week before. She had agreed to meet him, though he would not be allowed back to her place. She wanted sex in the park, and then she would leave him and make her way home, alone, and give her self to the Magician.


The night had been something of a success, but now she knew why she was giving up on sex. They guy she had chosen had been okay, but she had to suck him a good ten minutes to get him hard enough to penetrate her. and even then, it had been wham, bam, and thank you ma&#8217;am. He had finished inside her, as she had planned, but she was no closer to orgasm when he had finished, as she was when he started. It wasn&#8217;t his fault, she simply want that great on sex. But the Magician would take care of that for her.

She took the gel from the fridge and held it to her lips. The drug would take anything up to an hour to work fully, and she had a few things to do before she gave herself to the Magician. It would give the drug chance to be working when she finally did so. Maybe, if she was lucky, she would get one final orgasm.

Drinking the gel she couldn&#8217;t taste the drug, as the orange jelly flavour was stronger. She knew, now, that everything was out of her control. She didn&#8217;t fear what would happen, she already knew all about it. She feared the future, as that was something she had not been able to plan for. The computer would choose her new owner. The computer, when started, would contact one single person, and offer him the chance to watch her on webcam. He would be able to watch what happened to her from four directions at once, and when the show was over, her computer would send him the email with her address, and the location of the key.

First, though, she needed to shower.

Undressing she stood in front of the mirror. She had never been ashamed of her body. Though small in stature, she was blessed with larger breasts than she should have. They had always dropped a little, but the Magician would put that right soon enough. Her waist was slim, her flat stomach was due to much gym work in the past three months. She had always wanted to look here best for the Magician, and she had done well.

As the hot water cascaded over her, she felt the first tingle from her pussy. The drug was starting to work already. Perhaps the enormity of what she was doing was turning her on. She pressed a finger to her clit, but quickly pulled it away again. She had promised herself she would not play with herself, no matter what. She belonged to the Magician now. Her body was only on loan to her for a short time more.

Towelling off, she checked her shaven pussy. She again stood looking in the mirror. This would be the last time she would ever see her body like this. Within an hour, it would be modified totally, and forever. Even her new owner would not be able to repair the damage the Magician was about to do to her.

She walked to her computer and turned it on. Finding the program she was looking for, she started it. The program ran through a short list of names, pausing on each for a second, then moving on. It would take ten minutes before the computer chose her potential new owner, by which time, Justine would be all set on the Magician, and ready to start. She would not know who the computer had chosen. A green light would come on in the Magician&#8217;s room when the webcam had been activated, and he was watching, moments later, it would start, and even by then, it would be out of her control.

Moving to the room she closed the door behind her. The Magician stood, foreboding, silent, waiting. Waiting for her. She knew that Catherine&#8217;s story had only set in motion something she had dreamed of for a long time, and now she could do it.

The twin dildos were set on a narrow piece of wood that would raise and fall between her legs, the depth of the dildos controlled by the Magician. The metal corset in which she would be encased was a technical work of art. 

Justine worked for a company that had designed freeze welding. It was for use in places where welding needed to be done on the spot, but neither heat or sparks could be used. Gaseous areas. They had developed a way to freeze weld metal together. The corset that the Magician was going to put on, would use this technology. And once on, it would never be removed. she knew it was actually too small for her. But the Magician would make sure it closed.

She had considered a collar as well. Just as Catherine had done, but if no-one came for her, she would have to go back to her life as it was before. Well. Not totally, and she wouldn&#8217;t be able to explain a thick metal collar around her neck.

That was the worst of Justine&#8217;s fears. That the computer chose someone who didn&#8217;t then come for her. The Magician would release her from its grip when it had finished with her, though she doubted she would be able to walk for some time. If no-one did come for her, she would still be able to function, still be able to work. If someone did come for her, she would only do what he wanted her to do.

Positioning herself over the twin dildos Justine adjusted the thin board, lifting it up, hearing it click on the ratchets. It would need to be released from under the board, and once Justine was in position completely, she would be unable to reach it until the Magician released her. 

She leaned back against the rear of the machine and placed her hands behind her. She felt the metal cuffs, and placed her hands inside them. The Magician would snap them closed when he was ready to start. 

She kept an eye on the light above the door. It was still red, so no-one was watching her yet. As soon as it turned green, the Magician would start work, and Justine would be changed forever.

She didn&#8217;t even see it happen. The light flashed once, and turned green. Justine had been looking elsewhere at that moment, and it wasn&#8217;t until she felt the cuffs snap around her wrists that she knew she was being watched. There was nothing she could do now to stop what had started. She hoped, pure hope, that she would get at least one last orgasm before it was all over. But that was now down to the machine she herself had built. There was no-one else to blame. Not even Catherine.

The cuffs tightened holding her hands behind her, ad lifting them upwards. She could feel the pain in her shoulders already. The dildos between her legs pushed up, forcing their way inside her. She heard the ratchet click three times. This was as far out as they would ever be. She had been arse fucked, and she had been pussy fucked, but never both together, the feeling of both holes being invaded at the same time, was turning her on. Maybe she should have tried that before. But now, it was too late. That option was being taken from her. As the dildos started to move, thrusting in and pulling out of both holes together, Justine could feel how wet she was getting. She had never been this wet, or this turned on before. Was it the dildos? Or was it the drug? It didn&#8217;t matter, it was just so good.

From in front of her two arms began to extend. In her story Catherine had deprived herself of her nipples. Justine was going to be much more extreme than that. The two arms coming towards her held twin metal cups. These would cover her entire tits, forcing them into the cups. Not only would her nipples be of no use to her, but the whole of each tit would be encased in metal. 

At the same time, the lower arm began to extend, bring the corset closer to her. It was currently open, but once it reached her, the hinge would allow the Magician to close it around her. She had not tried it on, as she would never have been able to close it around herself. It would need the power only her machine could supply to do that. And it would.

The cold metal of the corset reached her first, the hinge spreading from under her tits, to almost between her legs. A small extension had a inch wide flat piece of metal with teeth, similar to alligator teeth. Once the corset was pulled tightly around her, this piece would cover her clit forever. The teeth would bite into her flesh around it, so she would not be able to get anything under the metal plate to get to her clit that way. Once the Magician had done his work, there would only be her mouth available.

She felt the corset start to close around her. She knew there would be a gap at the back, but the hydraulics of the Magician would pull them together. She knew it would pull on her ribs, and maybe she would have to learn a new way of breathing, shallow breathing, her waist would also be condensed, and once freeze welded in place, nothing on earth would get it free again.

The metal cups now made contact with her tits. Her arms held high and back, prevented her from pulling away, had she tried to do so. Not that pulling away would have helped. The arms would simply keep on extending until they found the purchase they were looking for. She could see as the cups covered her tits. Total encasement had been her aim, and as the cups rested against her rib cage, she knew she had succeeded. Nothing of her tit flesh showed outside of the gleaming cups. She stared at the rivets in each cup. They would split open as soon as they were popped into place. Opening up inside her tits, preventing them being pulled out. 

The dildos were now driving deeper inside her, and she could feel that rare warmth that started in the pit of her stomach. Her thighs were wet with her own juices, allowing the larger dildo in her pussy to slide easily, and deeply. She didn&#8217;t know how much was still outside of her pussy, it didn&#8217;t matter. The Magician was bring her ever closer to her own orgasm. 

Just then Justine noticed that the green light had gone out. There was no-one watching her. Whoever it had been, had turned off, abandoning her to her fate, alone.

She screamed at the Magician to stop, to wait, she wanted someone to see, but the Magician heard nothing. She felt the corset pulling tighter around her, squeezing her into it, her ribs bending under the pressure, her waist shrinking as the hydraulics worked there magic.

Pain shot through her whole rib cage, as she heard a metallic click, and the two sides of the corset came together behind her. Her breath came ion shorter gasps, partly because of the corset, and partly because Justine was so close to her orgasm, she could almost taste it.

She looked frantically at the light, willing it to turn green again. Her email. With her details, would only be sent out at the end of the modifications, and only then to whomever was watching her. The computer had chosen them at random, and Justine had no idea who had been watching, she wanted them back, and quickly.

She knew that now the corset was closed, the Magician would soon complete his task. Her clit was already covered, and she could feel the teeth biting into her body up both sides of her clit. 

She prayed that the light would turn green, but the blood red colour blinked back at her, as she heard a whirring noise from the Magician.

�Oh God no� she heard herself scream. �Not now, please, not now�

The Magician heard nothing. It had a job to do, and it would do it. Only humans changed their plans halfway through a task, machines were indifferent to emotions, and simply obeyed their programming. As the Magician was about to do.

Justine could feel the dildos ramming harder and deeper inside her, she had no control over her body now, as she gave herself to it. She tried to make the orgasm last, but she knew she couldn&#8217;t. her screams of ecstasy were married to her screams of pain. The dildos rammed as deep as they could, putting pressure on the pressure pads on the wooden horse between her thighs. Immediately, the tension springs were released, slamming against the walls of her pussy and her arse, sending similar rivets to those in her tit cups, into the walls of her pussy and arse, making the inserts permanent. She did not know, yet, how wide her pussy had been forced. Nor her arse. The whole thing was like two spectrums, open wide, spreading her holes. The one in her arse was touching, and had now become a part of, her lower bowels. The one in her pussy had crashed against here cervix. Never again would Justine feel anything that was put inside her by men.

Simultaneously, the electro magnets that the Magician controlled, were activated. The metal cups covering her tits became huge magnets, dragging the rivets into her tits. Justine screamed loudly as she felt the rivets forced in, and felt them opening inside her. 

She glanced up at the still red light, before she lost consciousness. The magician would support her for some time yet. This was also part of the program. Her modified body would be held in place for the night. In the morning. Justine&#8217;s new life would begin.


It had been three days. Three days since Justine was altered for all time. Her plans had gone wrong, though the Magician had not failed her. She had planned for someone to watch her ordeal, and then come and claim her. But they had turned off before the end, and had not been sent their details.

Her computer had recorded what had happened to her, and she could send the stream to anyone she wanted, but the computer would not reveal who had watched her for a while, could have become her owner, and then turned off too early. Leaving Justine to live her life the way she now was.

Unlike in Catherine&#8217;s story, Justine had actually gone out and bought clothes that would fit her after the modifications. She had known how slender her waist would be, and her tits. She knew that when her week&#8217;s holiday was over, in just four days, she could return to her work, and her life. 

Her biggest problem was the pain. She had been on painkillers since she had awoken, still held by the Magician. He had released her an hour after she had awoken, allowing her to collapse to the floor, her arms I agony, but not as much as other, more tender parts of her body.

Though the pain had diminished, it had not gone. The worst was that she had to sleep sitting up. She had tried lying down, but it had taken so much effort to get up again. She had not thought about how hard it would be to sit up wearing the metal corset. And the twin linings in her arse and pussy had made matters worse. For the past two night she had slept in a chair, not even trusting to sleep on the sofa, in case she slipped during the night.

She knew she had enough food to last until she went back to work. She had bought sufficient in case her new owner had wanted to stay at her place a few days, before moving her. Now, she had enough for herself, and food to spare. Before the modifications had always had a healthy appetite, but now, perhaps because of the unforgiving corset, her food intake was much less. The pasta salad she would normally have eaten all of, lay half uneaten, her stomach already feeling full. She knew that if this continued, she would lose weight rapidly, and with it, energy. She would need to get some vitamins at the first opportunity.

She was fully aware that her bowels were functioning properly. The intrusion had done nothing to stop that. In fact, it seemed to be making her ablutions easier. Perhaps because instead of having to squeeze through a small hole, there was now a hole that she could fit three fingers into at once. Her pussy was also larger than she had imagined it to be.&nbsp; She always knew when her bladder was full, but, she could feel nothing as she used the toilet to relieve herself. The metal casings were doing their job perfectly. 

She had stopped and looked in the mirror several times. Even though she had known what she was doing, was a aware of how drastic the changes would be, she still couldn&#8217;t get over the slim waist, the curve of her hips, and the firmness of her tits as she walked around. No longer did they bounce with each step. They did nothing, they simply sat still on her chest. The covers glistened in the lights, as if daring her to remove them. But that was not an option.

By the Saturday, with only two days before returning to work, Justine had, at last, started to dress. The jeans she had bought fitted her waist perfectly, but they were now tight in other areas. She knew that this would attract attention to herself, but she also knew that she could do nothing to prevent it. She had never actually dressed down in the past, but her new shape would make it harder to stop people watching her. Her chest, now standing high and firm, didn&#8217;t need a bra, but she had decided to wear one anyway. If only for memories sake. The jumper she wore curved around her new tits, bringing these to the fore as well. 

With this new body, she knew she would be able to attract the men. Unfortunately for her, they were now useless to her. Even prince charming would have done nothing for her now. 

The rubber panties she had started to wear had felt uncomfortable at first. It took some time to get used to how tight they felt. Cotton panties would not stop any leaks from her open pussy. And having no feeling there, she would never know, until it was too late, and very obvious, that she was leaking.

She had always worn flat heeled shoes, but they no longer seemed to go with the body she had, and the clothes she now wore. The three inch heels she had bought some time back, now suited her better than ever. 

The Justine looking back at her in the mirror, was totally different to the Justine that had originally built the Magician. That Justine was gone forever. The new sexier, and yet sexless, Justine looked back at her. 

Knowing, now. That no-one was coming to claim her, Justine knew she would have to face the world with her new body. She would obviously need more clothes. Only the ones she presently wore would fit her now. All of her others were too wide at the waist. None of her skirts or trousers would stay up. 

She knew she had no choice. 

Getting into the car was a challenge. She could feel the twin inserts as she lowered herself into the driving seat. This was another thing that had not been meant to happen. Had she been claimed, she would no longer have to drive anywhere. But now, she had no choice. Sitting straight backed in her seat, she could only just reach the pedals, and had to move the seat slightly forwards. It was all new, strange. This was something she had not anticipated. She had been so sure that someone would have come for her.

Slowly, she moved the car out of the drive and headed for the shopping centres. Other than the way she actually felt, there was nothing unusual on her way to the shops. It was when she got there that she suddenly felt self conscious. She knew she would be attracting attention. Not because of anything she was doing, but simply because she was wearing very tight jeans. Few men, even married ones, could resist watching a girl with tight jeans as they passed by.

The other things she didn&#8217;t anticipate, thinking her sexual days were over, was the inner feeling. The attention was actually turning her on, and she could feel the warmth inside her building up. Even before reaching the first shop, she had to call into the toilets. She knew she could do nothing to help herself towards orgasm, but as she pulled the rubber panties down, she could see how wet they had become. Her pussy was leaking, badly. 

In Catherine&#8217;s story, she had used a plug to stop the leaks, but Justine, who was never actually really sexual. Had not considered this, thinking that her days of getting turned on would end when she rendered her pussy useless. It came as a shock to her just how wrong she had been. She used a lot of toilet paper trying to fill the insert, to limit the wetness. Even then, she knew it would not last long. She would need a plug of some sort, and very soon. Her panties would stop leaks only for a while, of this she was certain. 

Dressing, and checking that her jeans were not showing any signs, she walked back to her car, all thoughts of shopping forgotten for the moment. She needed to get home and do something about the problem.

Perhaps the thought that she was getting turned on, made her even worse. She had only been home two minutes before she headed for the bathroom. The toilet paper was drenched as she pulled it out from the insert. She had never known herself get so wet before. In two days she would be back at work, and working with men. She couldn&#8217;t imagine the embarrassment she would feel if any of them knew how wet she was now getting. The leak, more like a river, needed to be plugged.

Searching through her drawers she found a old, no longer used, vibrator. She tried filling the insert with it, but, it was too small. Not only would it not stop leaks, it fell out as soon as she stood up. 

Justine sat on the toilet and cried. What had she done? The idea had been to remove sex from her life, and fins a new owner. What had happened to her was totally unexpected, and unwanted. 


It had taken a butt plug to fill the insert. No dildo she could find was wide enough to fit securely. She had felt embarrassed as eh went into the adult store and asked about them. Trying to say it was for a friend of hers, as a joke. She was sure the guy behind the counter knew it was really for her. The smile on his face told Justine that.

He had kept his eyes on her tits during most of the conversation. She didn&#8217;t know if he knew what was under the jumper she wore, and was sure he would be shocked if he could see. Men usually expect to find fleshy globes on a woman&#8217;s chest. Not metal.

As she left the shop she could already feel how badly turned on she was. Had she ever felt like this before the modifications, she would never have done it. In the past sex was a take or leave it option. Now, now it was too late, it seemed she was permanently turned on. Something had caused a chemical imbalance, keeping her turned on all the time.

She stopped at the nearest public toilets and pulled down the rubber panties. She couldn&#8217;t feel the release, but she heard the splash as her juices dropped into the toilet. Justine didn&#8217;t know what to do. The plug would stop her leaking, of that she was sure. But she was also learning rapidly, that she would need to empty her pussy regularly, if this trend continued. How much could a pussy hold? And how long would it take for this feeling and effect to wear off. Would it ever wear off? 

She knew, now, that returning to work was out of the question. It wouldn&#8217;t take long for one of her colleagues to realise there was something strange and new about her. Not only her figure, which had changed dramatically since her last day at work. Some of the best minds in the country worked with her. It would only be a matter of time before someone guessed. They may not guess exactly what she had done, but they would know something was wrong.

She had enough money in the bank to last a few months. As long as she didn&#8217;t go mad with it. She would also get severance pay, which would help. 

She typed her resignation, with immediate effect, and read it three times before emailing it to her boss. She knew he would try to persuade her to stay, but she knew she couldn&#8217;t. had her original plan worked, a resignation would have been sent automatically after the Magician had done it&#8217;s work.

She saw in her mind time after time, the green light turning to red, already too late to stop the Magician. That single moment had changed her life completely, and not how she had wanted it.

For a full day Justine simply sat at home. Trying to think of things that would stop the eternal feeling inside her. She now wanted sex. Wanted it more than anything. Her nipples tingled, as did her clit, though there was nothing she could do to make contact with either, and relieve the pressure.

Four times she had taken the plug out, and each time had released more juices in one time, than she had perhaps in all the times she had in the past.

It was impossible. It had to stop. But how?&nbsp; There was no relief, and no way to get relief. She felt her hands drift to her tits, finding only hard metal under her fingertips. She needed relief. It was driving her crazy.

In desperation she went to her computer. She ran a search for sadists, real sadists. Were there any out there? Maybe they would find a way to get her some relief. She found three who claimed to be sadistic, but when she chatted to them, and mentioned her modifications, they all backed away, and ended the conversations.

One man in the �chat room� had not said a word. It was as if he was logged on, but not physically there.

She was about to exit the room when a message appeared.

�Why?�

It was the silent man.

�Why what?� she typed.

�Why the modifications? Why so extreme?�

�It is going to sound strange, but I read a story, and wanted to test it out. I didn&#8217;t really think it would all work. But it did�

�You are looking for a sadist. Have you ever been hurt before? Before the modifications?�

�If you mean hit?� she responded. �No. �

they �chatted� for over an hour, during which time Justine told him much about herself, even to the point of telling him that before she used the machine, sex was a thing she did occasionally, and never got real satisfaction, and now, now it was totally impossible to get satisfaction, she craved it, was eternally turned on.

�How does that make you feel?� he asked.

�frustrated. Worse than that. Annoyed. I wish I hadn&#8217;t done it now. The whole plan was a failure.�

For another hour that chatted and then he suggested meeting. He could arrange to get to the town she lived in the following day, and they could meet somewhere populated, so she would feel safe.

She though about it for a while. Did she want to feel safe? Dud she actually want to be out in public at all?

He hadn&#8217;t said he could solve her problem. Nor did he say he would make it either better or worse. In fact, he had hardly said anything about himself at all.

�Meet me at my house?� she queried.

�Only if you want. You don&#8217;t know me, remember?�

�I didn&#8217;t know who the emails and web address were sent to� she replied. � So not knowing you really isn&#8217;t something I can complain about, is it? Please let me have your email address, and I will send you the details. And where to find the spare key. I haven&#8217;t yet recovered it. Just let yourself in. that is what would have happened if the other guy had not switched off the stream before the end.�

Justine knew she was putting herself in potential danger. But what the hell. Had everything gone right the first time, she had done exactly the same there. 

She didn&#8217;t sleep well that night. The thoughts that someone would enter her house, without knocking, and could do anything he wanted, was adding to her sexual frustrations. She imagined him fucking her, even though she would not feel it, imagined him coming deep in her pussy. None of this helped. Her frustration grew accordingly, but she could not get the idea out of her head.

It was almost dawn when she finally got to sleep. She had decided to undress first. She would be as she would have been had someone else came for her. She knew he would have asked to see the modifications anyway, so this simply saved the time. She knew she was acting through desperation, but didn&#8217;t care. 


Justine was still asleep in the chair when he entered the house. He stood looking at her. What was most obvious were the corset and her metal encased tits.&nbsp; There was not an inch of flesh showing anywhere on her tits. The cover up had been totally complete. The base of each metal cup was pressed tight against her chest, so nothing would get under it. The heads of the rivets could be clearly seen, eight around the rim of each cover. If, as she had said, they had split open as the entered her, there was no way of getting them out without ripping her tits to pieces. They were useless now, but would be just as useless if anyone tried to remove the covers. She had not done things in half measures. He couldn&#8217;t see the back of the corset, but he could see the shape it had now given her. To accommodate that, her internal organs would eventually rearrange themselves. A few years from now, if anyone found a way to get it off, her, she would be totally mis-shaped.

That she had done this to herself, or at least, made the machine that did it, was beyond most people&#8217;s comprehension. But not his. He had been about to leave the chat room that day, when she started telling the other three the modifications. He watched as they all took steps backwards, and one by one had left the room.

He had been fascinated by her. If she had done what she had, he was interested in meeting her. Now, standing before her sleeping form, he could see she had not lied. Her legs were closed, so he could not see her pussy, but he guessed that as she had been truthful about the other things, she was probably being truthful about what she had done there as well.

He was still watching her as her eyes flickered, and she started to waken, sitting up with a star5t as she realised he was there. 

Justine couldn&#8217;t find a voice, nor words. She simply stared at the man looking down at her, with a smile on his lips.

�Hi�. His voice was gentle. Not what she would have expected from a self confessed sadist, not that she actually knew what to expect. �I am James. You must be Justine. I was admiring your modifications. They look stunning�

Justine was still at a loss for words. Now he was here, she didn&#8217;t know what to say.&nbsp; Her mouth opened and closed, but nothing came out.

James sat down in the chair opposite Justine, and she saw his eyes drop to her crotch. Slowly, she opened her legs. Even though he had not said so, she knew it was what he wanted. He cast a quick eye between her legs, seeing the tip of the corset coming down and totally covering her clit. As with her tits, access was now completely removed.

�How far do the teeth go in?� he asked, referring to the crocodile teeth surrounding the clit plate.

�Half an inch� she finally managed to say. �they won&#8217;t come out. �

�You seem to have done a pretty good job of destroying yourself, Justine.�

Justine looked over at him, and could only nod.

James made no attempt to come any closer to her, and Justine was able. After a short time, to relax. She knew he could have done anything before she had awoken, but he hadn&#8217;t. and even now, he was sat opposite her, where she could see him clearly, and perhaps take evasive action if he did something she was not happy with.

But he was happy to talk.

And talk they did. Once again she ran through her life to date for him. He smiled, even laughed at some of her antics, but listened seriously when she told him what had inspired her to build the Magician. She even found and let him read the story of Catherine. 

�So what now. Justine. You want a Master to own you still?�

Justine didn&#8217;t know what to say. That was exactly what she wanted. It was what Catherine had got at the ends of her ordeal, though no further details had ever been added. Whatever happened, it had to be better than living alone with what she had done to herself.

After a few moments, she nodded, unable to find the words.

He told her to sit down, and he left the house, returning a few minutes later with a brief case. He opened the case and lay it on the floor in front of her, so she could see what was in it.

�Those five rings are for ankles, wrists and neck.� He started. �In a few minutes I am going to ask you to put them on, and it will be your own choice as to whether you do or not. But first, I have to tell you about them. They are made from a high density steel. They actually weight more than they look. They are also bio-magnetic. They are activated by your own body heat, closing when the inside of the rings get warm. However, and this is why you must make the choice yourself. They will not unlock. The bio-magnets are continuously fed from your body heat. The slightest body heat keeps them active, and locked. If you decide to put them on, I will take you from here, and you will come and live with me. I am not promising you an easy life. It wont be. You will earn your keep, in any way I decide. If you disobey me at any time, you will be punished. The choice, Justine, is yours. If you decide not to put them on, I shall pick up the case, and leave, and you will never see me again. If you do put them on, it will be for life. That is your choice.�

James sat back in his chair, watching her. He could see her running things through her mind, and left her to it. 

�May I ask what you plan for me?� she asked.

�No, Justine. Whatever I plan for you, you will find out later. You make your decision without knowing.�

She looked up at him, and knew it was pointless asking him again.

She looked long and hard at the case. There were, as he had said, five metal rings. Two were three inches wide, and two were even wider. Clearly the widest ones were for her ankles. The last ting, larger in diameter, but only two inches wide, was obviously the collar..

She knew she really had little choice. The past few days had shown her that even a short walk down the street, left her feeling self conscious. She had not felt that way once since James had arrived. 

Slowly, she picked up one of the larger cuffs. 

�It cant be removed?� she asked.

�NO. it cant. Once your body heat warms the inside of the cuff, it locks and even the slightest body heat will keep it locked.�

Justine looked again at the cuff in her hand. She knew that if she put it on, she was sealing her fate. She still knew very little about him. She had told him everything about herself, but he had said very little about himself.

But she also knew that had her original plan worked, she would know nothing about the person who had come to claim her.

With trepidation, she held the cuff around her ankle. The D ring obviously went to the side. Within seconds she felt the cuff close with a small click. She had now accepted James&#8217; offer, and he smiled as he watched her put the second ankle cuff in place. He smiled broadly as she picked up the first wrist cuff, and he heard it snap locked. Moments later the other was also in place, and she was reaching for the collar. James stopped her as she held it in her hands, moving it to her neck.

Taking the collar from her, he stood up and walked around, behind her.

He held the collar to the front of he neck, and smiled down at her, as the inside of the ring warmed to her flesh, and closed. Justine had accepted him, just as he had accepted her.

�Do you have a long coat?� he asked her.

�Yes, but it is upstairs�.

�Go and get it. Put it on, but nothing else. You will not be needing clothing again. And any that you do get, will be supplied by me.�

Justine was already half way up the stairs before she realised that he had just told her she would spend the rest of her life naked. As she passed the mirror, she stopped for a moment. The cuffs and the collar, shone brightly. Somehow, they did not look out of place. She knew she had made the right decision.

Maybe her plan had worked out well after all. Either way, it had still not been her choice. She knew, even then, that making decisions was a thing she would never be allowed to do again.

TO BE CONTINUED









Justine had been with James for three months, and it had not been an easy transition from being independent, to what she now was, a slave, at his every beck and call. No time of day was her own. She rose before he did to make his breakfast, ran his bath as he was eating, laid out his clothes as he was bathing.

When he was out, she meticulously cleaned the house from top to bottom. He often laid traps to catch her out. Things like a small piece of screwed up paper hidden somewhere it shouldn&#8217;t be. If it were still there when he returned home, she was punished. The food cupboards were locked when he left the house, though enough food to prepare his evening meal was always left in the fridge first.

The chain connected to her collar would not reach the front door, so leaving the house was not an option for her. She had not seen fresh air since her arrival, nor did she expect to do so in the very near future.

At night, Justine slept in a cage, and although it was not locked, she made no attempts to get out of it until her morning alarm sounded, signifying that she had fifteen minutes before James&#8217;s alarm would sound. Fifteen minutes to get up and make his breakfast.

This had been her routine for three months. And she knew it would continue this way for as long as he desired it.

James had been true to his word, and had arranged removal vans to empty her house. Some of the things had come to James&#8217; house, some had been sold at auction. The house itself had been rented, and now, Justine owned nothing of her own. Everything she had before she subjected herself to the Magician, was gone. And she knew, that just like the modifications, nothing could ever be reversed.

He had warned her that if he found he had an illness that would kill him, he would sell her before then. She would never again taste freedom. 

And yet, Justine was happy in her new life. She suffered the beating when she didn&#8217;t please him, reaped the rewards of his care when she did please him. He was never kind and gentle. That was not a thing she expected, or got. He would often beat her simply because he could, or wanted to, or because someone or something during the day had upset him. All of this, too, she accepted.

More than once he had come home, upset or annoyed, and she had paid the price. A thick cane hung over the fire place, and this was used on her. James had built a piano stool, but a little higher, so Justine could lean over it, and her wrists and ankles were tied to the legs. This gave her no escape as the cane strokes rained down on her. 

The first time it happened, he was muttering something about Bannister ruining his presentation. With the very first stroke, Justine knew how angry he was. A line of fire erupted across the backs of her thighs, and she screamed in agony. She was meant to be counting the strokes,&nbsp; but the pain was far too great to concentrate, and James didn&#8217;t seem to notice that she was screaming instead of counting. 

Twenty five heavy strokes landed on her upper thighs in less than four minutes. But James didn&#8217;t seem to care how much he was hurting her. She was just another item he owned and could use. And use her he did.

That night, Justine had not slept. Her legs were on fire, and she was sure he had cut her, though she could not feel any blood. Had she seen the heavy bruising he had caused, she would have died.

And on other nights, he came home in a good mood, took the drink she had learned to offer him as he arrived home, and sat watching television, while she finished his meal off, and brought it to him. Her own food was the same as his, but much smaller portions. And whilst his was served on a china plate, eaten with expensive cutlery, her own was served on a plastic plate, and eaten with plastic cutlery.

It had not taken Justine long to realise she was a second or third class human, in comparison with James. 

The cage in which she slept, was in the kitchen. She was allowed to use a bucket for a toilet, not the real one, even when she was running his bath. She had lost her long coat on the way to James&#8217; house, and was now, as he had promised, naked at all times. Whole sorting his clothes out, she could see there was no female clothes in the house. She would never feel another skirt, blouse, or bra. Though she did still have her rubber panties, but these, now, were controlled by James. He told her when and if she could wear them. It hadn&#8217;t happened yet, in three months. Her first period had been a total embarrassment, and she wanted the ground to open up and swallow her. There was no hiding that she was menstruating, but still he had not allowed her the panties. He had confined her to the kitchen, with its tiled floor, and told her to make sure the place was kept clean.

Just over a month before, he had come home one night and told her he was holding a party on the Saturday night, in the barn. She was going to be his maid, and serve the drinks. Anyone with a black spot on their hand, would be dominant, and she would call them Sir or Madam. Anyone with a red spot on their hand, would be submissive, and she would call them by name, if one was apparent.

Anyone with a purple spot on their hand, was a slave, and she was not allowed to serve them. He then explained that, as his own personal slave, he would expect her behaviour to be impeccable. If he received any complaint about her, she would be beaten badly. Then he dropped the bombshell.

�If any of My Dominant guests want a blow job from you. You will drop to your knees, and give them one. If they cum in your mouth, you will swallow, all of it. If a Female Dominant wants you to satisfy her, you will do so. Is this clear?�

Justine took a few seconds to take in what he had said. He was actually giving permission for others to use her mouth. Oral sex was not new to her, but not having control over who she sucked, was

�Sir,� she replied. �I have never had sex with a woman. I am straight�

�Not now you aren&#8217;t� came his terse response. �If one of My guests, male or female, wants you to satisfy them, you will do so. Is this clearly understood?�

Justine&#8217;s head dropped. She knew she had no choice, but other women had never interested her. She didn&#8217;t have the faintest idea of how to please them, but if she failed, she would get beaten. She simply could not win.

And the colours. Black, red, purple. She knew she had to do as he had said, or suffer. And yet, this was harder than surrendering herself to the Magician in many ways. What she had done then, was voluntary. Now, she was being given no choices.

She knew by his comments, that James was setting her up to service a few of his guests, both male and female. The men didn&#8217;t bother her, but the women were a different thing. She had never even contemplated sex with another woman, and now she was expected to please them, should they request, or demand it. And she knew it was demand. Anyone with a black spot was dominant, and dominants were the higher tier, submissive second, and herself, as a slave, last

There was another thing bugging Justine. And it wasn&#8217;t something she could talk to him about. He had made a decision, and she knew he would not change his mind. But though he had now become used to her own modifications, and James saw then everyday, and she was used to him seeing them, he would be inviting a large number of guests to a party, and they, too, would see them.

Once again she felt self conscious about them, and feared what others would say about her. She was used to James&#8217; comments every now and again, but to have total strangers stare at her? She wasn&#8217;t sure how she would handle that. But James had made his decision, and nothing on earth would make him change his mind. Certainly not he feelings. To date, her feelings had never been a consideration in anything he wished to do to her, or with her.

On the night of the party Justine was blindfolded and led across to the barn. She could feel the fresh air in her lungs, could smell hay in fields close by, and though freedom was, perhaps, a few steps away, she did not see it, and made no attempt to run. He had not even been holding her, she found her way simply by following his spoken instructions. 

Once inside the barn he made her kneel and wait, as he turned on lights and heaters. Though it was a pleasant day, the night would be much cooler, and as some of his guests would be undressed, he always tried to make sure the lace was not too cold.

Eventually Justine was led to a table in one corner, where her blindfold was removed. The table was full of clean glasses of various shapes and sizes, and James quickly ran through what drink went in which glass. He listened carefully. She knew James would not repeat himself, and she also knew that if she served the wrong drink in the wrong glass, she would pay for it. She had been beaten badly just over four days before, and still bore the marks, she did not want more punishment if she could avoid it.

Her job, would be to make sure that his guests had full glasses at all times. She would pass around, and between them, making sure everyone had a drink, if they wanted one. She would return to the bar area, pour the drink, and return it to the guest, curtsey, and thank them for using her services.

This meant that every guest would be able to see exactly what modifications she had done to herself. Maybe they already knew, but after tonight, they would know for sure. Of that she had no doubts.

A car was heard pulling up outside the barn, and Justine was told to kneel by the table and wait. Obediently, she dropped to her knees, as James walked out of the barn door, returning a few minutes later with three other people.

The first was a woman who looked to be in her forties, dressed from neck to toe in skin tight black latex. She was both tall, and slim and&nbsp; Justine could tell she was wearing nothing under it.&nbsp; Anything under the latex skin would have clearly shown up.

She was followed by two other people. The first was clearly a girl, in her early twenties, her hands bound behind her back, and naked. Even her head had been shaved. The second was&nbsp; a boy, also in his early twenties. He was dressed as a French maid, black dress that came to just below his butt cheeks, white apron, white maid&#8217;s cap, and frilly underskirt. It was obvious he was wearing nothing under the outfit, from a modification that could be clearly seen.

His cock was being stretched downwards, due to a heavy weight fastened to his fore skin. At first, Justine thought it had been tied or clamped, but as he moved closer, she could see a metal ring going through his fore skin, and holding the weight. Even without the weight, the boy would never have sex. His foreskin was never going to go back over the head of his cock, thanks to the ring.

Still on her knees, she was in a position to see how the girl had been modified. It was nothing too obvious, and Justine guessed that had she been standing up, she may not have noticed it. The girl&#8217;s labia had been pierced in several places, and a lace threaded through the holes, and pulled tight together, lacing the girl&#8217;s pussy closed. 

The guests and James stopped by Justine, as he told her to bend over a table, legs spread wide. He then explained to the woman about Justine. The pussy and arse were lined by eight inch long surgical steel liners. Justine would not feel it if she was getting fucked, apart from feeling the man, or woman, crashing against her. Inside, she would feel nothing. It made no difference. Pussy or arse. Both were wide open, and lined. The corset was welded in place, James explained. Not bothering to explain the concept of freeze welding, even though Justine had explained it to him. And the tit covers were riveted in place. He also explained that none of Justine&#8217;s modifications could ever be reversed.

James enquired about the two people with her.

Pointing to the male she answered.

�This is Bella. She will be able to help your own slave with service. She is an anal virgin, but has been told that, should anyone wish to use her, they are free to do so. It has frightened her. And this is Dolly� the woman said, pointing to the shaven headed girl.

�She too is an anal virgin, but is free for use. As is her mouth. Her pussy is laced shut, but she still has the other holes to be used. Both together if the Darien twins are coming.�

�They may be� answered James. �They were not sure if they could make it tonight. But if they do, I am sure Dolly will entertain them. My own slave, apart from being the bar slut, is available orally. �

�Does she have a name?� asked the woman.

�No. I took her name away from her, and have not yet given her a new one. Tonight she can be known as bar slut. �

the woman started to laugh, as she and James moved away, leaving her own slaves alone with Justine.&nbsp; Both knelt down, their thighs open, hands on their&nbsp; knees, and looking down. Neither of them spoke, and Justine didn&#8217;t want to start a conversation in case she got herself, or them, into trouble.

Over the next forty minutes, other people arrived, and slowly the barn began to fill. Justine was kept busy fetching and carrying drinks, and the boy she had heard called Bella, was working just as hard. Many of the people were well dressed, though in latex, rubber and leather, though a great many were naked or semi naked, on collars and leashes, or simply kneeling I submission.

Justine often found herself staring at people. So many had rings or other things through different parts of their body. One girl had a large tattoo on her back depicting a battle scene from the English Civil War. The one Justine felt really sorry for was a small blonde girl. She obviously had no use of her hands, as large rings had been forced through them. Justine couldn&#8217;t even imagine how that must have felt. The rings were a quarter of an inch thick, and four inches in diameter. They had been passed straight through the centre of the girl&#8217;s palms. These rings had then been connected to other rings through the girl&#8217;s nipples. Locking her hands in place. Justine watched for a few moments, but the girl&#8217;s fingers didn&#8217;t seem to move at all. 

It hadn&#8217;t taken long for Justine to realise that everyone in the barn, was either interested in, or had experienced some for of body modification. She actually forgot about her own self consciousness. Her own modification seemed to pale into insignificance compared to some of the others she had seen.

At one stage a naked girl was strung up by the wrists to a pulley hanging from the centre of the barn. Other than the ropes that held her in place, she didn&#8217;t seem to have anything done to her. The girl&#8217;s face was contorted in pain, her whole weight pulling on her shoulders. Justine felt sorry for her, but there was nothing she could do for the girl.

It was about an hour later when James spoke over a micrphone.

�Ladies and gentlemen. Broadsword is auctioning off this slave. She was born into slavery, being his own daughter. So far, she had no modifications, which sort of makes her a blank canvas. She is not here of her own free will, and has not been trained as a slave. To I suspect whoever wins her, is going to have a battle on her hands. We will start the auction in the usual way, bids, in private, to me before ten o&#8217;clock. . Broadsword had informed me that there is a reserve on the girl. If the reserve is not reached, then she will be taken home, and Broadsword himself will modify her. That, ladies and gentlemen, would be a sore loss. We all know what Broadsword is like. The envelopes are on the table, looked after by Fuck-Me, and they should be handed to me when you have placed your bid. And no, I do not know what Broadsword&#8217;s reserve is, and wont until the auction starts. Now please, take a good look at her. She is eighteen years old, has wonderful skin tone. Great muscles, and I am sure the right jewellery will make her look even better. Her mother cant be here tonight, she is a little tied up�

There was a ripple of laughter that that point. Obviously that comment had meant a lot to a good many people. Justine didn&#8217;t understand, but she did feel sorry for the girl, still hanging in the centre of the barn.&nbsp; Justine had, basically, chosen her own fate. This girl, was not being given that opportunity. 

Justine kept an eye on a clock that hung on one wall of the barn. She could see several people approach James with little brown envelopes, obviously bidding on the unfortunate girl.

�Ladies and gentlemen� James&#8217; voice boomed out across the barn again. �I have asked if she has any sexual experience at all. Does she understand any of what will befall her. The answer is a definite no. three virginal holes, and a body that knows nothing of pain. So come on, ten minutes left to get your bids in. don&#8217;t blame me if you are prepared to offer more than she goes for, ands haven&#8217;t bid that high.�

Justine couldn&#8217;t believe what was happening. Someone was actually selling his own daughter. It didn&#8217;t seem to cause any upset among the others in the barn.&nbsp; And yet, Justine would have given anything to let the girl free, before this madness came to a head. Her only problem was the fear of retribution. She had no doubt that James would punish her severely if she made any attempt at all to get the girl free.

The clock ticked slowly. Agonisingly towards ten. The girl couldn&#8217;t see the clock, as it was behind her, but people had begun to gather in a circle around her. The time was obviously imminent. In a very short time, someone would own her, 

James stood on a podium at one side of the barn, microphone in hand.

�Ladies and gentlemen. The time has arrived, and all bids are in. no more bids will be accepted now, if you have not put on in, don&#8217;t cry to me, I have no tissues with me.�

Another ripple of laughter filtered its way through the crowd.

�First I will look at the reserve.� He said, taking a whiter envelope from his pocket. Quickly he opened it, and read what was written on the paper. James looked over at the girl&#8217;s father, and smiled.

�Okay� I have your bids in the envelopes, that cannot be changed. I will call upon each of you, in turn, to reveal your bid to the rest of us. Remember folks, you may only bid the amount written in your envelope. If your bid is unsuccessful. Then I am sorry. Only one of you can win her. �

0ver the next few minutes James called upon many different people to announce their bids. The numbers surprised Justine. She had never known a slave could be as valuable. One man, a white haired old man who seemed to have no-one with him, raised a lot of laughs when he was called upon.

�Winter? How much is your bid?�

The white haired man stood up and spoke with a clear voice.

�My envelope is empty, Sir� her responded. My bid is actually zero. Untrained, un disciplined she will take a lot of work. Until she gets some work under her belt, so to speak, she is worth nothing�

A huge jeer went around the crown. The man was obviously well known, but everyone seemed surprised that he had not put a high bid in for the girl.

Others had bet massively high sums, but James was giving nothing away.

Justine found herself suddenly upset as she learned that James had also put a bid in for the girl. She was his slave. His only slave, she didn&#8217;t want to share hi, with anyone. The relief when she hard other bids above his, was audible. Justine had no idea what she would have done had James won the girl. It was beyond her comprehension that he would even make a bid. Had she done something wrong? Was he tired of her already?

Fortunately, James had not bid high enough, even though he had bid over two thousand dollars for the girl.

All during the auction the girl hung from her restrains, kicking out, trying to get her hands free, but to no avail.&nbsp; Only when the auction was over, would she be lowered.

�Ladies and gentlemen� called James. We have all the bids, and all have been confirmed. Now we find out if Broadsword&#8217;s reserve has been met.�

Pulling the white envelope form his pocket again, James pulled the slip of paper from it, and began to read.

�I understand that most of you will put in high ids for my daughter. However. This is going to be a reverse auction. My daughter will be sold to the lowest bid, not the highest. All I ask, is that the winner take care of her in the usual fashion. She is plinth worthy, and would hate it. Good luck to all who bid�

�Well� started James again after the room hushed. This leaves us with a predicament, doesn&#8217;t it? The lowest physical bid was five hundred dollars. And normally, that would be the winning bid. However, Winter also put a bid in, and though the envelope was empty, his bid has to be considered legal, and acceptable. As this was a reverse auction, I have no choice but to announce Winter as the winner.� There was a lot of cheering, whistling and foot stomping as James made the announcement. He waited until it die down, and then turned to the girl&#8217;s new owner.

�Winter. As the winner, the choice is yours, you are not bound by Broadswords wishes, but you may consider them and agree. I have a single question. Plinth, or not Plinth?�

Justine had no idea what they were talking about but even so, she wanted the whiote haired man to say no.

�Plinth� replied Winter. �It was her father&#8217;s wish, and I see no reason to deny him a last wish�

Again cheers rang out loud and long as the old man spoke. The girl&#8217;s father moved to shake his hand, and Justine could see him whisper a �thank you�.

Moments later a wooden plinth was brought into the centre of the barn. It was like a vaulting horse, on a high stage. The horse was padded, but the base was much wider than the top. 

The girl. Still hanging by her wrists, and struggling to get free, seemed to know what was about to happen. She screamed for release, but none was coming. Not yet.

He father, Broadsword raised his hand and pointed it at his helpless daughter. There was a blue flash, and she kicked and screamed, her who body shaking uncontrollably, before suddenly hanging limp. At first, Justine that she had been killed, until she heard Broadsword laugh and tell everyone that tazer guns had their place.

The girl was then lowered and placed on the vaulting horse. Her arms were stretched down and fastened to hooks at the base of the horse. Her legs were also pulled out and won, end fastened to the horse. It was clear to Justine that the girl&#8217;s pussy was now available. And she would be able to do nothing to stop it. But would they violate her now. Or wait for her to waken. The answer was wait. Now she was in place, general chatter returned, as did Justine and Bella being over run with drink requests.

No other slave had been appointed to help her, and after the auction. Everyone seemed to have a thirst.

She had seen, when she was delivering drinks to a man in rubber, Bella on his knees in front of a male slave, the slave&#8217;s cock buried deep in his mouth. Neither the slave nor Bella seemed happy about it,&nbsp; but it seemed that had no choice.

As for Dolly, Justine had not seen her for a long time. But after seeing what was going on around her, Justine doubted that Dolly had held onto her virginity

�Ladies and Gentlemen� James bellowed over the noise. The plinth is now available.�

Justine looked over and could see that the girl was finally awake. Someone had added a blindfold, so she had no idea where she was, or what was happening to her. Though she would soon know.

A step was placed at one end of the vaulting horse, at the end between her legs, so people could stand on it, and reach their target. The girl&#8217;s pussy.

The man Broadsword was close by, and, as Justine could see, was removing his latex trousers. She had to look away, unable to watch as Broadsword moved behind the girl, his cock already erect, and stood on the step. The room had gone silent. Only the moans of the girl could be heard, as Broadsword played with his cock, less than an inch away from his daughter&#8217;s pussy. 

Someone started a countdown. From ten. The whole crowd counted down, and at three, Broadsword moved into position. Justine couldn&#8217;t watch. This was wrong, and the count continued.

�Two. One. Zero�

as the crowd shouted Zero, Broadsword pressed his hips forwards, his cock entering the bound and helpless girl.&nbsp; She screamed as she felt something press into her. She tried to wriggle free, but the ropes held her tight, as her father pulled his hips slowly back, and grabbed hold of her own hips.

A shriek that could wake the dead came from the girl&#8217;s mouth as Broadsword rammed his own hips forwards, ripping through her hymen. and sinking his cock deep inside her pussy. No-one seemed to care that he was committing incest. This was his own daughter. First he had sold her, and now, he was fucking her, as if she didn&#8217;t matter.

For ten minutes Broadsword took advantage of her, his hips ramming in and out of the bound girl. The screams had stopped, but the sobbing was shaking her whole body/

With a groan. Broadsword rammed his hips as far forward as he could, and held his cock deep inside the girl&#8217;s pussy. Everyone knew what was happening. As he filled the girl with his own cum. Anywhere else, he would have been arrested. Here, as he slowly pulled out of her, there were cheers.

Even as he pulled out an walked away, others were lignin up to take his place. Many of then were slaves at their owners insistence, but other Dominant men were also lining up. It seemed that the girl was free to all, and many would take advantage of her.

The party had been a month before. And even as Justine was being placed in her cage for the night, she knew she had to ask.

�Master. Why did you bid on the girl? Are you tired of me already?�

James laughed loudly before answering.

�No slave. It is traditional for the host, if there is an auction, to put a bid in. I put one in I know wouldn&#8217;t win. It&#8217;s a good job I didn&#8217;t put a blank envelope in, isn&#8217;t it, as host, I would have beaten Winter. And you would now have a sister slave.�

Still laughing, James had walked away, leaving her to think about all that had happened at the party.;

Now, a month later, she was still doing the best she could for him. It would be terrible, now. If he was to get another slave. What had happened to the girl on the plinth had made her fully aware that she was, in the end, only worth to James what he got out of her. No-one at the party had requested a blow job from her. Perhaps James had not made her available. But she knew he would have no qualms about doing to in the future. Her only hope, was to keep him happy, and make him want her.

The alternative, was unthinkable.
