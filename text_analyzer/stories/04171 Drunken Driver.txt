Chapter 1. The accident

&quot;KERRUNNNCH!!&quot; Geoffrey Williams turned
abruptly at the sound of shattering glass and bending, rending metal. &quot;Oh
my God, no!&quot; The horrific noise came from his car; his classic Triumph TR4
sports car; the car he'd so lovingly restored. The cause of the damage was
equally apparent. A Cherokee jeep 4 x 4 had reversed into it. Geoff surveyed
the damaged car for a minute or two. Getting angrier as he realised it would
take a garage a long while to put it all back in running order again even if
the insurance company didn't just decide to total it. 

&quot;You go and talk to the driver while I take some
pictures of the damage, Geoff. I've got the digital in the boot of my
car.&quot; It was Bob Maynard who lived a few doors down the road. &quot;Thank
God you weren't still inside it. She just didn't look. Nearly knocked Sandra
and me over.&quot;

Bob's words brought Geoff back to the present situation and
he turned to see a woman tottering towards him. &quot;Is thaat yoooor liicckkle
caar? Yoooo shud hav piik paarked it wher et cud bee seen.&quot; To all the
onlookers that now surrounded the incident, it was very obvious the woman was
drunk. So drunk she could hardly stand and it was amazing she had even got to
the supermarket without having an accident.

Geoff took his mobile from the pouch at his belt.
&quot;I'm getting the police,&quot; he informed her.

The words seemed to momentarily sober the woman.
&quot;Don't do that. I'll lose my licence and my job. Please don't. I'll pay
for your car somehow. Soooomhoooow.&quot; The words faded into a long slur and
she seemed likely to collapse. Geoff caught her under the arms and lifted her
into the passenger seat of the Cherokee. He noticed she was an attractive
woman, he guessed she was probably mid-twenties, and no ring on her marriage
finger. The engine was still idling so he reached over removed the keys, and
put them in his pocket.

&quot;I've taken about a dozen pictures
Geoff and I'll put them on disc and you can print them out,&quot; Bob informed
him, &quot;You get through to the police? Sandra and I'll be witnesses.&quot;

&quot;We saw it all too,&quot; Fred Peck spoke for
himself and Sally his wife. &quot;No one should be on the road in that state.
Could have killed a whole load of people.&quot; Geoff thanked them and took the
names and addresses of two other single people whom he didn't know and who saw
the accident.

&quot;I think maybe I'll keep the police out of it though
but that doesn't mean she's going to get away with it. There's been no personal
injury and Morrisons car park is private land so we don't have to report it. I
also doubt if her insurance will cover the real cost of a classic car, so maybe
I shall have to make sure she does pay ' Soooomhoooow'. Geoff mimicked that
last word she had spoken. Bob looked at him in askance and then nodded. 

&nbsp;

&quot;Marion Blanch?� You won't know me, I'm Geoffrey
Williams, but do you do you know an Anne Caffrey?&quot;

&quot;Yes, she's my house mate. Why? Is she all right?
What has she done now?&quot;

&quot;Only got herself blotto and wrecked my car. Apart
from being out of it at the moment, she seems okay and is sleeping it off. Her
jeep is hardly marked.&quot;

&quot;I guess chucking her boyfriend didn't go well. The
police will take her licence this time and that will mean the bitch will have
to find another job. That will mean I have to find all the rent for this place
again. Where is she now?&quot; Geoff talked to her for another fifteen minutes
and soon found out there was no real love between the pair. They just shared
the house and it seemed Marion was doing more than her share of the housework
while Anne complained about the way things were done.

&nbsp;

Anne woke and tried to look around. Her head hurt, her
mouth tasted foul and her eyes wouldn't focus. Light filtered through the gaps
around the curtains. She tried to turn over and found she couldn't easily do
so; her wrists were tied behind her back. By the feel of the bedclothes against
her skin she could tell she was naked. &quot;Where am I?&quot; Anne tried to remember
what happened. Instead of her dumping Roy, he'd turned up for their lunchtime
date with another girl and ended the relationship. She went to a pub late
afternoon and drunk Vodka. It didn't seem to have much effect until she got
outside. &quot;I'll get another bottle from Morrisons,&quot; she'd told
herself, &quot;They're open till 8 p.m. I still have time.&quot; Of the journey
there she could remember nothing but then there was that horrible bang and that
man complaining she'd hit his silly little car. Then all those people talking.
Last thing she remembered was being sick into a toilet somewhere. It wasn't her
place, that much she knew but where was she?. &quot;Oh God, my head hurts. I
need to pee. HELP!&quot; Her cry wakened Geoff who turned to face her back.
&quot;Oh my God,&quot; Anne cried when she realised she was in bed with
someone. But who was it? Man or woman? Hands clasped her shoulders and turned
her over. &quot;Oh God, you!&quot;

&quot;Toilet's straight across the landing. It may still
smell of your spewing from last night but you can clean it later.&quot; Geoff's
tone was abrupt. &quot;It's only 5:30 so you can come back to bed for another
hour after you've done.&quot;

&quot;But my hands�&quot;

&quot;You'll just have to do the best you can
Annie.&quot;

&quot;But I'm naked.&quot;

&quot;You don't need clothes to piss. Just go and do it
and get your arse back here.&quot;

&quot;What have you�? Untie me!&quot;

&quot;Shut up woman. Go and piss and get back. Don't make
me any angrier than I am now.&quot;

&quot;I demand�&quot; Whatever it was she was demanding
never got voiced. Geoff rolled her face down on the bed, threw the clothes off
and slapped her bare bum hard. After a dozen her buttocks were well reddened
and his hand smarted a little. Anne started swearing, crying and threatening
him with dire consequences when she got free. If she had her way, he would
never father a child!

Pushing her out of the bed, Geoff quietly said,
&quot;Have your piss and get back here otherwise it will be the belt that
caresses your arse. You are in enough trouble as it is.&quot; Geoff lay back on
the mattress and pulled the bedclothes over him. He knew she'd seen his
erection but that didn't worry him. She'd see much more of it later if he had
his way. 

Although it was difficult Anne struggled to her feet and
went to the toilet. She couldn't close the door properly with tied hands but
her bladder badly needed relief so she had to pee with the door ajar.
&quot;What does it matter? He must have seen all of my body last night. Perhaps
he even saw me pee then too.&quot; The thought disgusted her. Wiping was
difficult but she eventually did it.

&quot;We'll talk after breakfast Annie.&quot;

&quot;Anne!&quot;

&quot;No, Anne is too grown up a name for a woman of your
behaviour. Annie is better for a childish creature. Now unless you wish to have
another spanking, lie down for another hour.&quot; Anne started to mouth
another smart reply but thought better of it. She was pretty helpless. For a
while she lay with her back to him her mind fuming at her treatment and
wondering what he was planning to do with her. &quot;It doesn't feel like he's
raped me yet but the way his cock is pressing against my bottom, that could happen
at any time. Bastard! Just because I backed into his car! Could I help it?
Oooohhh, my head. Just because I had a drink too many! Just because that
bastard Roy dumped me in front of that tart.&quot; These and many other
thoughts ran though her infuriated mind as she lay waiting for him to make a
move. For the moment he seemed content to lie quietly beside her.

A minor upheaval of the bedclothes woke her from a light
doze. Anne lay still pretending to sleep. She heard him pad to the toilet, pee
and flush before returning to the bed. &quot;Time now to handle my
purchase.&quot; Geoff roughly turned her face up and uncovered her. 

&quot;I'm not a purchase! You haven't fuckin' bought me.
Let go of me. Untie me! I want to get my clothes and get home, you've no right
to keep me here against my will.&quot; Geoff said nothing but went to a drawer
and removed a necktie. Before Anne really knew what was happening he'd bound
the tie around her mouth and knotted it behind her neck. Although she tried
hard enough to speak she quickly found the makeshift gag was effective and gave
up.

&quot;Now you just listen to me Annie. I
have bought you just as effectively as if you were on sale in the market. Make
no mistake about that. Had I wanted, you would have been in a police cell now,
charged with driving whilst under the influence. You would have been banned
from driving and from the amount you'd had over the limit, probably imprisoned
after your court appearance. I know the case against you would now be
considerably weakened because you were not tested last night but your behaviour
was witnessed by many people whose names and addresses I have.&quot; Geoff
spoke quietly and forcibly. Secondly there is the loss of my car. It was a
customised classic car which had I put it up for sale at a classic car auction
it would have easily fetched �20,000. Your insurers will not take that into
account, of that I am sure. Most likely they will only pay out the Grey Book
value which is �8,000 so there is a deficit there of �12,000 which you are
going to pay, that is if you keep to your promise of last night. A promise made
in front of witnesses. Do you remember saying, &quot; I'll pay for your car
somehow,&quot; when you begged me not to report it to the police?&quot; Anne
vaguely recalled her promise and nodded, yes. 

&quot;I was hoping the damage was repairable but Mike, my
trusted garage mechanic, told me last night after he'd towed the car in and had
a chance to look at it, that the frame was buckled. It seems that you hit the
TR4 hard enough to shunt it into the wall behind it. Worse, Mike said the wall
was damaged and security at Morrisons deemed it unsafe and would be claiming
against your insurers for the repairs. At a rough guess that will cost another �1,000
or so. You do have insurance, don't you?&quot; The look of horror crossed
Anne's face immediately told Geoff that she didn't. Removing the tie gag he
demanded crossly, &quot;Tell me you were not so stupid as to drive
uninsured?&quot;

Anne was crying now. She knew it was illegal to drive
without the insurance. &quot;I didn't have the money so I put it aside
intending to pay it when I had a good week. Commission hasn't been too good
lately,&quot; she sobbed.&quot;

&quot;So you were driving whilst totally drunk and
without any insurance. They'll throw the book at you for that Anne. One helluva
fine and probably a prison term. I presume you didn't pay for the car so you're
making payments to a finance company.&quot; Anne nodded. &quot;Are you up to
date with your payments? Why the expensive Cherokee?&quot;

&quot;It's none of your business,&quot; Anne spat the
words with a defiance she didn't really feel. Just how much more trouble could
she be in?

&quot;It is my business or at least I am making it my
business. You wrecked my car so I'm going to have to use yours. In any case it
is illegal for you to drive it. I can on my car insurance although the cover is
more limited. I guess from your answer that you are behind with payments, just
like you are with the payments for the flat you share. You're in a real
financial and legal mess Annie, so yes I have in effect bought you until all
your debts to me are paid off and that could take quite a time.&quot; 

All through the conversation, Geoff sat by her side and
played with her breasts. &quot;Yes and now it is time for me to play with my
new purchase.&quot; Anne was so upset by the information, she hardly noticed
until his hand went between her legs and massaged her cunt lips and clit. She
pleaded with him not to touch her but he ignored her and continued until she
became very wet. &quot;Okay Annie, here's what we are going to do for starters.
You will stay with me for the whole weekend while I try and sort out the
insurance claims and money matters. During that time you will make your body
and your car available to me. Sometime during either today or tomorrow when I
get a better picture of your behaviour, I shall punish you. In view of the
gravity of the offences the punishment will necessarily be severe but
afterwards we'll see what can be done to sort your life out. Your life in my
service. Now let's shower and get some breakfast. Pity we haven't time for a
good fuck but that can come later.&quot;

&nbsp;

Chapter 2. Freedom?

&quot;Hi Mike, meet Annie.&quot;

&quot;The bitch who caused all this trouble?&quot; Mike
eyed the young woman wearing only a button up dressing gown and shoes. Anne
blushed under his gaze but delicately took the offered hand. Inside she could
hardly contain her rage. She'd been forced to suck him off in the shower and
then made to wear the dressing gown his mother wore when she visited. Her own
vomit-stained clothes were in the washing machine and would have to hang on the
outside line to dry for all the neighbours to see. At breakfast he'd treated
her like a servant and forced her to make the tea and toast the bread. She'd
demurred but a sharp slap on her already tender arse encouraged her compliance.
Now he'd dragged her out with next to nothing on. True her body was covered but
she knew that everyone would guess at her nakedness underneath.

&quot;You come to see the damage for yourself, Geoff?
Sorry it's worse than I first thought. No hope in hell of repairing it and
getting it through a MOT. It's on the ramp if you want to look.&quot; Mike
pointed out the crumpled places in the main frame. &quot;I presume her
insurance won't pay the full value but you should get something for it.&quot;

&quot;She doesn't have insurance Mike and if I claim on
mine they will find out and inform the police so she could go to jail and I
would still end up with nothing. At the moment I have her but that's not much
compensation.&quot;

&quot;So what are you going to do? We can strip the car
and sell the parts to the TR4 Owners Club members but that'll only bring in a
couple of grand and take quite a lot of work. You would still have to pay for
the remainder to be taken away. Perhaps a club member might take the whole
package for spares or Tatlock &amp; Watkins might take it off your hands but
they're dealers and you wouldn't get much of a price. At least with them you
would get it out of the way in one go.&quot; Mike looked thoughtful but
couldn't come up with any better suggestions.

&quot;I'll think about it over the weekend Mike and let
you know on Monday. Stripping it is going to take a lot of work. Could you give
Tatlock's a ring and see what they will offer?&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Good morning Marion,&quot; Geoff greeted Anne's
housemate when they entered. After the usual pleasantries, Geoff turned to
Anne. &quot;Go and get some proper clothes on Annie and pack what you need for
the weekend. Just one suitcase. We're not going out and you won't be wearing
much. And find all the paperwork for the jeep and the insurance stuff. If
you've got other outstanding bills bring them too.&quot;

&quot;Who says I'm going back with a bastard like
you?&quot;

&quot;Just do it Annie.&quot; Geoff's voice tone was
quiet but threatening. Anne went into her own room and Geoff turned his
attention to a bemused Marion.

&quot;So what gives between you two apart from her
wrecking your car like you told me on the phone last night?&quot; Marion asked.

&quot;I just bought her,&quot; smiled Geoff, &quot;But
it's likely to be a poor bargain.&quot; He went on to explain a little about
what happened and then asked, &quot;Does she owe you rent money?&quot;

&quot;�340 at the moment and I doubt she'll pay next week
either so then it will be �425.&quot;

&quot;Are you two an item?&quot; Geoff asked.

Marion laughed, &quot;Is that a polite way of asking if
we have a lesbian relationship? No we don't. She seems very stuck up about sex
so I don't wonder that her boyfriend chucked her. Me I swing either way.&quot;

&quot;So you wouldn't mind if Annie gave up her room here
and you could take someone else in?&quot;

&quot;To be truthful I was going to give her notice to
quit if she didn't pay up by the end of the week. She's not the most pleasant
woman to have around and not the tidiest either.&quot;

&quot;If you haven't anyone in mind one of the
secretaries at work is looking for a place. I guess she's somewhat older than
you are and finally got the divorce settlement but her house is to be sold and
there won't be much left after the mortgage is paid off. She's got a regular
income and has always seemed agreeable when I've had dealings with her. Give
Annie her notice to quit before we leave. I'll cover the cost of her back rent
but it will take a week to get sufficient funds transferred to my current
account what with all the other expenses.&quot;

&quot;I just hope you know what you're doing Geoff. She's
got a nasty temper and can be very mean with it.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, I know but she's also got a sore arse and it
will be even sorer before she goes to bed. Now let's see what she is doing.
She's had more than long enough to put a few things together.&quot;

He marched straight into Anne's room without knocking and
found her lying on the bed still in her robe crying, thumping hell out of the
pillow and swearing quietly. &quot;Get out!&quot; Anne yelled, &quot;I'm not
ready.&quot; Without pausing in his stride. Geoff went to the bed, lifted the
hem of the robe and slapped her buttocks half a dozen times in quick
succession. Marion was stunned but said nothing. Nor did she comment on the
already rosy colour of her housemate's arse. It was obvious this man had dealt
with Anne before. 

&quot;That's physical abuse,&quot; Anne screamed,
&quot;And in front of a witness. That's illegal. I'll take you to court.&quot;

&quot;Driving while drunk and without insurance is also
very illegal. And I don't think your witness was actually looking at the time,
were you Marion?&quot;

&quot;No, I didn't hear or see anything. Nothing at all.
I just came in to tell you to pay your rent by the end of the week or move
out.&quot; 

&nbsp;

Anne was fuming by the time they arrived at Geoff's home.
&quot;So if I don't stay with you I'm going to be homeless and penniless. You
really are a bloody sodding fucking bastard Geoffrey Williams.&quot; Geoff had
sorted through her wardrobe and packed her case with a couple of dress suits
and toiletries but hadn't allowed her to change out of the dressing gown.
&quot;You had your chance earlier Annie,&quot; he told her, &quot;You didn't
take it so mother's dressing gown it has to be for now.&quot;

Bob Maynard knocked soon after they got in and gave them
a disc with the crash photos on. &quot;I'll keep copies on my hard drive in
case the disc gets damaged,&quot; Bob told them. Geoff and he chatted for a
short while and by the way he kept looking at Anne with her reddened tear
filled eyes, it was clear he was trying to size up the situation but Geoff
didn't enlighten him. When he showed the pictures on screen to Anne, she tried
to look away but tears formed in her eyes when she realised Geoff had been in
his car only moments before. If he'd been a few seconds later, she could now be
facing a manslaughter charge.

By mid afternoon, Geoff had time to relax. Most of the
previous few hours were spent on the telephone and going through the papers
Anne had brought. She reluctantly helped and sullenly answered his questions.
In the end he showed her the tally of all her debts as far as he could
determine them. They came to nearly �30,000 without the unknown sum that was on
her credit card since the last statement. Anne just sat and sobbed when he
tried to explain her dire financial straits to her. Geoff tried to put an arm
around her shoulders to comfort her but she pushed him away and aimed a flurry
of blows to his head. &quot;Just because you think you own me, doesn't mean I
have to like you. All this just because I dented your baby car.&quot;

Outwardly calm but inwardly seething with anger, Geoff
threw Anne over his shoulder and carried her in a fireman's hold to the spare
bedroom. Tossing her on the bed he tied her wrists and ankles and put a tie gag
around her mouth then spoke in his usual distinct low tone. &quot;I'm going to
leave you alone for an hour to reflect on your situation Annie. At the end of
the hour I will release you and you will be free to leave. I will bring your
suitcase and you can dress in your own clothes but I will keep your car keys
because you are not allowed to drive. I will give you a further hour to dress
and leave. Once you have left it will be up to you to sort the mess of your
life out and how you are going to pay off all your debts. You will be
completely free of my control. Alternatively, you can come to me and ask to be
taken into my ownership. In return I will try and sort your money problems but
you will remain in my ownership for as long as it takes to repay me. You will
also apologise for your behaviour and ask me to punish you for it. Ownership
means just that. You are mine to do with as I please and that does mean having
sex with you. The punishment will be hard and painful but will not cause any
permanent damage but it will be a punishment that you will remember for a long
time, a very long time. When it is all over, I will do all I can to help you.
Those are your choices. Think carefully before deciding.&quot; After repeating
the options and making sure she understood them, Geoff left the room.

Anger played a greater part in Anne's choice than careful
thinking. Cursing and swearing she quickly dressed and left the house. It took
nearly an hour for her to walk and drag her case the one and a half miles to
Marion's house. By the time she arrived she was tired and still very angry with
Geoff, with herself, with everyone. They were all against her. Marion looked up
with surprise when she entered. &quot;I thought you were leaving for good and
living with your boyfriend Anne,&quot; she said.

&quot;He's no boyfriend! He's just a pervert!&quot;
Gradually Marion coaxed the story out of her. At first she tried to appear
sympathetic but each time she tried she remembered how she'd frequently had to
dig into her savings or go without a meal because Anne hadn't paid her share on
time. Now she was more than a month overdue with the rent and the woman Geoff
recommended sounded nice on the phone and had a proper job and seemed willing
to help with the housework.

&quot;You're a fool Anne. For the sake of taking a
hiding, something you deserve anyway, and sleeping with him is no big deal, you
pass up the chance to have a man help you clear your debts. You're a real
bloody fool woman. You've no money, and you'll be out on the streets at the end
of the week because I cannot keep this place going without someone else paying
their way. I've already got someone coming to look at your room tomorrow so you
will have no choice but to go. What'll you do then? Become a prostitute? You'll
be owned by a pimp instead of a man who seems to have some interest in you. If
you've any sense left go and ask to be taken back.&quot; She would have liked
to have asked to see the punishment carried out but didn't.

&quot;You snotty bitch! You see the trouble I'm in and
you want to rub my nose in it. Some friend! You're just a fucking bitch. You
were eager enough to take my money when I had it but now I'm finding it
difficult you want to throw me out.&quot; Anne continued to berate and threaten
Marion until the poor girl went to the phone and called a colleague from work. 

Anne was still swearing and cursing when Trolly, a big
jovial lad arrived. &quot;What's up Marion?&quot; After receiving an
explanation interrupted by more abuse, the lad turned to Anne, &quot;I'll see
you off the premises,&quot; he said as he'd been taught when training to be a
club bouncer.

&quot;I live here you stupid pratt!&quot; Anne screamed. 

&quot;I still think it will be better if I escort you out
instead of the police. You've threatened Marion with violence and been abusive.
Which is it to be?&quot; Gently but firmly he escorted her, still swearing and
cursing, out of the door. &quot;Phone Rachel and ask her to come over and we'll
sit with you until I have to go to work,&quot; he called back to Marion.

&nbsp;

Anne sat on a bench in the shopping centre trying not to
cry. &quot;What am I to do? I've only a few coins in my pocket and my credit
cards are in my purse, which I've left in the flat, not that they will be of
much use. Am I a fool as Marion suggested? Will I have to become a prostitute?
Isn't being owned like a slave by that man the same as being like one of those
whores? Will he really thrash me? How bad will that be? No, it will be too
humiliating to submit to a man like that. Worse than when he spanked me. And
then he wants to fuck me. He said so. I'd had no choice then, now I will have
to ask for my punishment. I just can't do that. It's all Roy's fault; he
shouldn't have dumped me like that.&quot; The whirlwind of thoughts chased each
other around her mind. Usually they fixed the blame for her situation on
everyone but herself. Roy, Geoff, Marion and Stella, the bitch who'd muscled in
on her lucrative cosmetic sales round. Only occasionally did she apportion any
blame to herself. 

Spicy smells from the near by takeaway wafted across the
foyer making her feel hungry and reminding her that she'd not eaten since breakfast.
It caused her to remember the smell of the roast dinner Geoff was cooking when
she stormed out of the house. Thinking about it made her feel even hungrier.
&quot;He would have fed me. No, more likely he would have put a bowl of food on
the floor for me to eat like a dog.&quot; She didn't really believe that but
such was her hatred for the man, she'd imagine anything.

&quot;Sorry miss, you'll have to leave now. We're closing
the place up.&quot; The security man brought her out of her reverie. Looking
around she noticed with some surprise that the place was nearly empty. A few
cleaners were clearing rubbish and a family with two small children walked
towards the exit. Slowly she got up and followed them. 

Outside she found an empty bench on the pedestrianised
street and continued the debate within herself. Daylight was fading and the
orange hue of the sodium lights bathed the area but fortunately the air
remained reasonably warm. &quot;I'll sit here for a while and then try and get
back into the flat when that Trolly has gone,&quot; she said to herself,
&quot;Marion the bitch will have to let me stay until the end of the
week.&quot;

&quot;You wanna come to the pub for a drink?&quot; Anne
looked up with disgust at the two late teenage youths. They'd been in the
shopping centre, she remembered. Both had shaven heads, prominent tattoos and a
stud in their nose. One had a safety pin through his eyebrow. Both looked hard
and tough. Behind them a group of four boys laughed and joked. It was blatantly
clear they wanted more than to drink with her.

&quot;No!&quot; Anne snapped, &quot;I'm waiting for
someone.&quot;

&quot;No need to wait, we can give you a good time.&quot;
The youth rubbed his groin suggestively.

&quot;Go away!&quot; They moved a few yards and spoke
with a few other youths. Their laugher annoyed Anne. They were poking fun at
her. She decided to move along the main street. The youths followed a short
distance behind but called out to her every few minutes. &quot;Why can't
everyone leave me alone,&quot; she cried bitterly. By now it was completely
dark and she left the shopping area of the town and approached the junction
with the ring road. From the sound of their voices, Anne knew the youths had
closed the distance between them. Fear welled within her. &quot;If I turn left
the road runs alongside the park where they can easily drag me into the bushes
and molest and rape me,&quot; She reasoned. &quot;Two hundred yards to the
right is the turning that leads to Geoff''s house. Shit! What choice do I have!
Either way I will be raped and probably hurt. If I go to Geoff's there's only
him and it will be in a bed and I most probably will be taken care of
afterwards. He said he'd help me but then I walked out. The hour he gave me has
long since passed. He might turn me away.&quot; She turned right and speeded
up. Her fear of the boys was greater than her fear of Geoff. 

The youths laughed and called obscenities and walked
faster too. By the time she reached Geoff''s road, they were close behind her
and she began to panic. &quot;This road goes nowhere lady. Yer caught now and
we're going to have our fun with yer. There's a church just up the ways where
we can have a nice long fuck � or two or three,&quot; the youths taunted her.
Anne started to run as fast as she could. The youths thinking she was trapped
in the cul-de-sac allowed her to get a little ahead. It was a game to them.
Anne ran to Geoff's door and kept her finger on the doorbell. Sensing they
might now lose her the youths stood near the gate until the door opened and she
fell in.

&nbsp;

Chapter 3. Punished

&quot;They were going to rape me,&quot; Anne gasped when
she picked herself up. &quot;They were going to rape me in the
churchyard.&quot; Tears once more flowed from Anne's eyes. Never had she cried
as much as in the last 24 hours or so.

&quot;I wondered if you would turn up. Marion said you
were thrown out of her place hours ago.&quot; Geoff ignored her pathetic expression.
&quot;Are you hoping to stay? You know what you have to do if that is the case.
Or shall I put you back outside and call the boys?&quot; He tried to sound as
if it didn't matter to him, one way or the other but secretly he was hoping
she'd agree to stay and be owned and punished by him. He'd often imagined what
it would be like to own a woman and this could be his one opportunity. This
woman, while not his ideal, would serve but she had yet to even apologise for
wrecking his car or to thank him for trying to keep her out of prison. She
would soon.

&quot;You wouldn't�&quot; But when he pulled her by the
arm she knew he most probably would. &quot;Stop, Geoff please. I'm sorry.&quot;

&quot;Well that's a pitiful attempt at an apology.
Perhaps I didn't make it quite clear earlier or maybe you thought I would
forget. If you want to stay here under my protection you have to three things
to do. The first is realise you were completely in the wrong yesterday and to
apologise sincerely for what you did. Secondly, and more importantly, you have
to agree to be owned and used by me until such time as you've paid off your
debt for keeping you from the police and for sorting out your other money
problems. Thirdly, you have to ask me to punish you for your behaviour so far.
Now you've had many hours to think about it, more than the one hour I
originally gave you, so either agree or walk back out of the door. Make your
mind up now. If you stay your body will be sore before you go to bed. Don't
expect me to be kind to you until I see a definite change in the way you treat
others.&quot;

&quot;You bloody pervert! You just want to see me cry
while you whip the shit out of me. You just want a tame sex toy for free.
You're a�&quot; Before she could finish the sentence Anne felt herself being
propelled towards the front door. Geoff didn't say a word; he didn't need to.
Anne's fear of the youths was greater than her fear of him. They might still be
waiting outside or with their mates in the town centre. And where would she
sleep tonight if Marion didn't let her back in. No doubt she would have the
door chain on by now. She'd hoped he would relent over her punishment after her
near rape but he wasn't going to be influenced by it. Grabbing his hand as he
went to turn the latch she pleaded, &quot;Geoffrey, please don't send me away.
You can do what you want with me. I am sorry for wrecking your car last night.
It was my fault.&quot; Slowly she sank to the floor sobbing in utter despair.
Having resisted for so long now she'd finally given in, exhausted and too weak
mentally to fight any longer. 

&quot;Come Annie, let's get it over with,&quot; Geoff
whispered as his arms encircled her body and lifted her from the floor. For a
minute or two he held her close in a bear hug and kissed her forehead.
&quot;Come Annie,&quot; he repeated and led her through the kitchen. &quot;You
know where the toilet is. Do what you have to and then undress and go into the
bedroom. Don't make it worse for yourself by refusing or objecting. Just do
it.&quot; He watched her climb the first few stairs and then went to the garage
where he collected the items he'd put together in anticipation of her return.
Not having done anything like this before, none of the proper equipment for
restraining and whipping a person was at hand. Sorting through the stock stored
'in case it might come in useful', he found a roll of three inch wide Pirelli
webbing left over from repairing his armchairs and two skipping ropes that he'd
bought for his young nieces when they visited several years previously. From
the roll of rubberised webbing he cut a two-foot length and reduced the width
of one end to form a crude handle. &quot;This will make an effective strap and
shouldn't cause any real damage,&quot; he thought after having tried it on his
own palm and found it stung badly. &quot;Should I split the ends like a tawse,&quot;
he asked himself but decided against the extra work and he couldn't see the
purpose of the split ends. The cotton ropes only needed the handles removing
before they were ready for use. 

Anne was slowly undressing when he entered the bedroom.
He didn't hurry her but waited until she was naked before ordering her to lie
face down on the bed. Quickly he looped the bight of one rope around her ankles
and fastened it the foot rail. Anne yelled. She hadn't expected to be tied down
and began struggling. &quot;Calm down dear, it's going to happen whether you
struggle or not and you are more likely to hurt yourself in the struggle.&quot;
Geoff put a knee in the small of her back and then secured her wrists to the
bed head. Anne tried to voice her protest but the necktie gag he'd used earlier
was effective in silencing her. 

&quot;Anne, I daresay you never been thrashed before and
I've never done it to anyone although I've often fancied doing it. Now I feel I
have a just cause because I know that if I don't you will never mend your ways
and I will suffer, you will suffer and everyone around you will suffer. In some
ways I'm looking forward to doing it but I guess you're not. No matter. When
I've finished, you will be extremely sore but that will go after a few days and
there will be no need for a repeat unless you give me good reason. I'm going to
use a wide strap, which I expect, will send ferocious pains through your body
but shouldn't damage your bones or cut you. Remember this is a punishment. It
is meant to hurt. Remember too that you have given your body for me to own.
Seeing you lying there naked and helpless has already made me horny so
afterwards you will have to take care of my needs. Understand?&quot; Anne shook
her head, no. &quot;I didn't ask if you agreed, I asked if you understood. Did
you?&quot; This time Anne dumbly nodded.

Geoff started at the back of her thighs and brought the
first stroke down hard. The flesh across both legs turned white with the impact
and then reddened. Anne's body jerked and a muffled cry came from her mouth.
Geoff repeated the stroke slightly higher with a similar result. He knew he was
hurting her, he knew he was going to take his revenge on her flesh for having
wrecked his car and for endangering the lives of everyone by driving whilst so
drunk. He hoped he was going to enjoy making her suffer but seeing her hurting
like that, he wasn't so sure. Slowly he worked his way along her buttocks until
he reached the base of her spine. By then Anne had taken fourteen terrible hits
and lay sobbing into the now wet pillow. All the wide welts overlapped and her
arse was one homogenous area of fiery red pain. &quot;That's enough for now
Annie. It's over.&quot; Geoff was disgusted with himself because inwardly he
wanted to carry on, he wanted to turn her over and slash her front but he could
see she wouldn't take much more pain. She would have to do something about his
hard cock though. &quot;Annie girl, you're going to cost me much more than if I
paid a whore so I'm going to get my money's worth,&quot; Geoff told himself.
Freeing his cock he held it to her face. &quot;Suck it Annie,&quot; he
demanded, &quot;Suck it like you did in the shower this morning but this time
there will be no spitting it out. Just be thankful I'm not climbing on top of
you and fucking you properly.&quot; He removed her gag and before she had time
to comment, pushed his cock between her lips and held her head. &quot;Suck it
girl. Don't lie there like a rag doll.&quot;

&quot;Bastard! Bastard! Bastard!&quot; Anne repeated to
herself over and over again but she started to suck knowing that if she didn't
he could cause her even more pain. Shortly afterwards she felt him erupt within
her mouth but he didn't remove his cock for several minutes.

&quot;Lie still for a bit while I'll run a cool bath for
you to soak in. If you promise not to start screaming I'll leave the gag off.
Do you promise?&quot; Hesitatingly Anne nodded her assent.

&nbsp;

&quot;Oh God I do hurt so bad. I was sure he was going to
fuck me after I got out of the bath, his cock was hard again when we came to
bed&quot; Anne mused. &quot; I wonder why he didn't? Did he really care that he
would hurt me after the hell of a thrashing? All he did was maul my tits and
then hug me before he fell asleep.&quot; It was 2:33 a.m. and she had hardly
slept at all. Her arse was terribly sore and swollen and the effect of the
Anadin tablets was wearing off but she couldn't move without waking Geoff, her
owner. The pair lay on their sides, face to face, their bodies touching. Geoff
had one arm protectively around her shoulders. &quot;I can feel his cock
against my mound but it's not hard now. Not like it was when he came to bed. Wish
I dare bring my knees up and crush the bastard's balls. God this pain is
getting worse. I really ought to sue him but then the whole story would come
out and I could still be the one in jail. However did I get into this mess? I'm
going to have to try and move and get another couple of Anadins.&quot; She
tried to slowly lift the arm from her. Geoff woke.

&quot;What's up Annie? Need more painkillers and
cream?&quot;

&quot;Yeah and I'm bloody thirsty.&quot;

&quot;The correct answer should have been, 'Yes please
and may I have a drink please.' The way you say things is very important.&quot;

&quot;Dammit man, don't you know I hurt like hell,&quot;
she said under her breath and then out loud, &quot;Yes please and may I have a
drink please Sir.&quot;

&quot;Forget the Sir bit. Just ask nicely. Do you need to
pee?&quot; 

She did but soon found every step was agony and she
didn't dare sit but she resisted asking for help. As she limped passed the
full-length mirror on the wardrobe door, she caught a glimpse of her now very
colourful arse. &quot;I ought to go to Social Services and show them that. He'd
be put away,&quot; Again she knew she couldn't do it but she resolved to get
her own back somehow.

&quot;Painfully pretty,&quot; Geoff commented as he
entered the room, &quot;But not less than you deserved. I just hope for your
sake, this is the one and only time I will have to do it to you. Here's your
drink and tablets.&quot; Anne silently took them. &quot;What do you say?&quot;

&quot;Thank you,&quot; she muttered not wishing to upset
him. &quot;Oh my God, the bastard's getting a hard-on looking at me. I don't
suppose it will be long before he fucks me.&quot; Anne's thoughts were correct.

&quot;Bend over the bed Annie, so I can put the cream
on.&quot; When she was in position, Geoff pushed her legs a little further
apart and applied the cream to the sore places before turning his attentions to
her cunt. Anne protested but a light smack quickly reminded her of the
situation. Carefully he fingered her opening and then sucked her clit. Although
mentally Anne wanted to close her legs and keep him out, her body responded to
his attentions and her juices began to flow. &quot;Before you start
complaining, remember I am your owner and I am now going to use what I
own.&quot; Slowly he inserted his cock and began to quietly fuck her. Anne
tried to lie still and just let him have his way but the foreplay and now the
stimulation of his cock was too great and her arse began to move albeit only a
small amount because of the pain. Even so it was enough for her to orgasm well
before Geoff shot his load. Kneeling again, he tongued and kissed her opening
and then offered his cock to her mouth for cleaning. &quot;Don't even think
about refusing Anne. I've cleaned you and now you'll clean me. Reluctantly she
did so.

It was still only 3:14 a.m. when they climbed into bed
and he cuddled her closely to him. Anne wanted to resist but somehow felt warm
and safe with his arms around her. &quot;It's Sunday so we can lie in but if
you need more cream put on before then, wake me,&quot; Geoff whispered in her
ear.

&quot;Don't you really mean, putting more cream in
me?&quot; Anne replied bitterly.

&quot;Depends on how much you stimulate me dear.&quot; 

&nbsp;

Chapter 4. The dinner party

&quot;Good morning Marion� Ellen.&quot; Geoff greeted the
two ladies and then introduced Ellen to Anne. &quot;Ellen works in personnel at
the council,&quot; he informed her, &quot;She may be able to fix you up with a
job especially as you're giving up your room for her.&quot;

Ellen smiled and nodded indicating she now had an
obligation to him. &quot;I'll see what I can do for you Anne. I didn't know you
were a ladies man, Geoff. Sort of thought you were a confirmed bachelor. How
long have you known her, you sly dog?&quot;

&quot;About thirty-five hours.&quot;

&quot;I don't think she had much choice Ellen,&quot;
interrupted Marion. Ignoring Anne, the three chattered with some good-natured
banter for ten minutes. Geoff said they hoped to get most of Anne's stuff out that
day and Ellen agreed to move in straightaway. &quot;That will save you one
week's rent Geoff.&quot;

&quot;I'll go and start packing,&quot; Ellen stated,
&quot;Thanks for your help Geoff. We can talk about what sort of jobs she can
do at work tomorrow. There isn't too much choice at the moment.&quot;

&quot;I see by the way she walks, you've punished
her,&quot; Marion said when Ellen had departed, &quot;Would you mind if I
looked?&quot;

&quot;Of course not. Better still wait until I get the
first load in the Jeep and while I'm taking it you can have a proper look at
her. She owes you interest on the rent.&quot;

&quot;No Geoffrey please. I'm not a lesbian. She's tried
before and I've refused. Please Geoff, no.&quot; 

Anne pleaded but Geoff was adamant. &quot;You have no
choice in the matter. If I wish to give you to another, then I will do
so.&quot;

An hour later, Anne lay naked on the bed. &quot;You can
do whatever you like with her Marion except hurt her. If she refuses to
co-operate I will punish her when I get back. I'll bring the strap with me just
in case.&quot; Anne again tried to protest but she knew it was hopeless.
Letting Marion play with her would be less painful than the dreaded strap.

&quot;Thanks. Looks like you really did give her a good
hiding this time and it doesn't look as if she will be going to work tomorrow.
Do you know if Ellen is inclined towards women?&quot; Geoff had no idea.
&quot;She's been married for about ten years, maybe more, but I suppose that
doesn't mean much.&quot;

Anne turned on her side to face the wall when Geoff
departed but Marion pulled her on to her back again and had a little grin when
she saw Anne wince as her bottom touched the mattress. &quot;I wouldn't mind
using the strap on you Anne but for now I must make do with playing with you
this once before you leave. We could have had a little fun with each other
before�&quot;

&quot;I'm not a les. Don't even care for men much and I
only give in to that bastard because it's painful not to,&quot; Anne
interrupted.

&quot;And it will be painful if you don't let me play
with you now. You�ve been quite a bitch all the time you've stayed here so I
wouldn't be sorry to see him put the strap on you. In fact I would be quite
pleased. Perhaps across your front or your tits.&quot; Before Anne could
answer, her flat mate kissed her full on the mouth. A full-blooded, open-mouth,
lover's kiss. Anne tried not to respond but Marion's tongue gradually
insinuated its way between her lips and she succumbed to her arousal when
Marion started to massage her breasts. Marion's mouth made a wet trail down the
helpless girl's neck and settled first on one nipple, then the other. &quot;I
can tell you like that Annie�&quot;

&quot;Anne!&quot;

&quot;No, Annie now. I can tell you like your titties
being sucked. Your cunt is really flowing.&quot; Anne could feel the woman's
fingers gently probing her vagina and nipping her clit.

&quot;Dammit, why does my body do that? Why can't I stop
myself getting wet? I don't really want her doing that to me but it does feel
nice. You'll have to pretend it doesn't though,&quot; Anne chided herself.

&quot;You shouldn't be the only one to have some fun
Annie. Time for you to give something back.&quot; Marion slipped off her slacks
and knickers and laid herself in the sixty-nine position on top of Anne. 

&quot;Aaaaaagghhh!&quot;

&quot;Oh sorry Anne. Forgot my weight on you would hurt
your bum,&quot; Marion apologised, &quot;You'll have to lie on top of me. We
should have a little while before Geoff gets back.&quot; They changed places
and Marion started licking and sucking her partner�s slit. &quot;You have to do
the same to me Annie. Get your head right down between my legs and start licking.
Do to me what I'm doing to you.&quot;

&quot;No, please Marion, no. It's disgusting.&quot;

Marion reached around and gripped each buttock and
squeezed. Anne gave another cry as her arse sent its pain signals to her brain.
She got the message and started licking.

&nbsp;

&quot;You were quick Ellen.&quot;

&quot;I'd most of the stuff for this trip already packed
so I only had to throw it in the car and this little thing doesn't hold all
that much even with the back seats folded down.&quot;

&quot;I'll dump these empty boxes for Annie to fill and
then help you to unload.&quot;

&quot;Thanks Geoff. That would be nice.&quot;

Geoff let himself and Ellen in using Anne's key and
walked straight into the bedroom. &quot;Oh my God,&quot; Ellen cried,
&quot;Just look at her arse. You do that Geoff?&quot; She took in the sight of
what they were doing and suggested, &quot;Geoff, I think we'd better wait in
the kitchen for five minutes.&quot; 

&quot;Marion will give you the full story but the short
answer is, she was drunk and smashed up my car and then hadn't any insurance
and is up to her eyeballs in debt so there's no chance of any payment for the
time being. I kinda bought her.&quot; Geoff explained when Ellen asked.

&quot;Do you think Marion will want me to do that?&quot;
Ellen asked nodding her head towards the bedroom.

Geoff realised she was asking about the sex scene in the
other room. &quot;She just said she swung both ways. I don't think Anne has
done it before. What about you?&quot; 

Ellen blushed, &quot;Not since I was a teenager. Did you
know about her when you suggested the flat?&quot;

&quot;No, I only found out later but I gather you won't
be forced into anything. Annie wasn't, until today that is.&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;I've invited Marion and Ellen over for dinner on
Friday so we'll have to do something a little special. Any ideas?&quot; Geoff
asked.

They'd been together for only twelve days and for Anne it
was her third day at work. A truce existed between them. Anne did what she was
told but without too much enthusiasm. In bed she opened her legs or mouth for
his prick when told and although she tried not to respond, increasingly she
couldn't help herself. The insurance on the Jeep had now been paid so she was
able to drive it but as Geoff kept control of the keys she'd only been allowed
out once on her own. It wasn't really her car any longer, Geoff had the finance
agreement transferred to his name but in her mind it was still her car and it
only served to reinforce her subservience to him.

A week previously Geoff informed her, &quot;You can start
as a trainee receptionist next week. Claire is leaving on maternity leave in
two weeks so you can take her place. You'll have to fit in with the others. The
pay's not too good to start with but it's certain each month. Certainly it's
better than some of your sales weeks, but way below your best. However, you've
no rent or food to pay and I'll only take seventy-five percent of your money to
pay off your debt. It will be convenient because we can both travel together.
If you can sort the P15 and other paperwork you start Monday.&quot;

&quot;Is that the best you could do?&quot; she'd answered
sulkily.

&quot;What did you expect? Personal assistant to the
Chairman? It was that or cleaning jobs unless you wanted a place on the refuse
collection round.&quot;

It was Wednesday and they were driving home when he told
her of the invite. &quot;Oh no! You're going to humiliate me again. Please
cancel it Geoff please,&quot; Anne pleaded.

&quot;Annie, they know about us. They know what I did to
you although they don't know about last weekend's spanking. The colour of your
bottom would have faded had you not lost your cool and thrown the book at me.
If they ask to see your bum then I'll let them. They are the only ones to know
the full details of what happened, everyone else just thinks you moved in with
me.&quot;

&nbsp;

The meal went well. Nothing elaborate but it was good,
wholesome English cooking. Roast beef casserole done in the slow cooker set on
a timer so it was ready soon after they arrived home and only the vegetables
needed preparing and cooking. Geoff offered Marion and Ellen a glass of sherry
while they waited for the meal. Both offered to help in the kitchen and soon
all four were chatting away amicably and Anne's situation seemed forgotten.
During the meal Geoff opened a carton of red wine and offered it to the guests.
Anne asked to have a glass too. Geoff at first refused to allow it, which
caused her to scowl for a few minutes. Later he relented but limited her
consumption to two glasses. Throughout the meal the conversation continued
pleasantly. Afterwards the two guests became rather tipsy and were merrily
giggling by the time they finished the wine, &quot;so it didn't go to
waste&quot;. Geoff had drunk a couple of glasses too although not as much as
Marion and Ellen.

&quot;I guess you two better stay the night,&quot; Geoff
remarked when the evening grew late, &quot;There's a double bed made up in the
spare room and I've no doubt you have already slept with each other. You've had
too much to drink to drive and Annie and I are probably over the limit as
well.&quot;

&quot;I'd rather sleep in your bed,&quot; Marion giggled.

&quot;I would too. It's been sometime now since I slept
with a man and I do miss having a cock inside me,&quot; Ellen commented.

&quot;Typical!&quot; laughed Geoff, &quot;I'm a bachelor
for all these years and then when I get a woman, two others want me as
well!&quot;

&quot;I don't want you,&quot; Anne grunted, &quot;I'm
only here because you're blackmailing me.&quot;

&quot;Then you won't mind if Marion or Ellen shares my
bed and you sleep in the spare room. Ladies, let me toss a coin to see who
shares my bed, I know I won't be able to service both of you tonight.&quot;
Marion won the toss. &quot;It looks like you'll be sharing with Ellen,
Annie.&quot;

Despite her protestations of not wanting to sleep with
Geoff, Anne was a little jealous that he would take Marion to their bed and
fuck her. &quot;I'll sleep on the couch,&quot; Anne muttered.

&quot;You'll keep Ellen company or do I have to remind
you of your position here?&quot; 

Anne quickly acquiesced realising he would have no
compunction in spanking her in front of the others if she made a fuss.
&quot;Ellen will probably be less of a problem than Marion,&quot; she thought
but this was nullified when Geoff ordered, &quot;Treat Ellen as your mistress
and to do everything she commands.&quot;

Half an hour later when she passed the half-open door to
the master bedroom anger again welled within her as she saw and heard Geoff
ploughing into his companion for the night. She hated him, she hated Marion,
she hated Ellen, she hated herself. &quot;Why should I have to be nice to that
Ellen?&quot; she asked herself, &quot;She doesn't own me.&quot;

Ellen was in bed but not asleep when Anne entered the
room and was about to climb in alongside her when Ellen quietly suggested,
&quot;Please take off your nightie Annie. It is not that I want to make love to
you or anything, but I don't have one and it would make me feel inferior.&quot;

&quot;Why should I take any notice of what you
want?&quot; The words were spat out.

&quot;Because you have no wish to have another hiding and
I've no real wish to see you get one,&quot; Ellen replied quietly. &quot;Taking
the nightie off is not going to hurt you is it?&quot; 

Reluctantly Anne took off the garment, climbed in
alongside Ellen and turned her back to her and lay quiet. Anne�s mind though
was in turmoil. &quot;Why is he doing this to me? Taking that Marion bitch into
his bed. Kicking me out and giving me to another woman. Aren't I good enough
for him?&quot; Suddenly it all overwhelmed her and she burst into tears. Her
body wracked with sobs. Ellen listened for some minutes before turning Anne so
they faced each other and then pulled her close to her breast. It wasn't a
sexual embrace, rather it was the comfort a mother would give a daughter.
Cradled in the older woman's arms, Anne felt protected but tears continued to
flow. Ellen handed her a tissue and gradually the tears abated.

&quot;I believe you love him Anne.&quot; Anne shook her
head. &quot;I know he's hurt you and made you do things you wouldn't have done
had you not been forced but most of what he has done has been for your
good.&quot; Again Anne shook her head, no. &quot;I know he's told you times
enough that had he not taken you in, you'd probably be in prison but he's done
more than that, he's entered your heart. He's helped you become a better
person. Basically he's a good man and if he wasn't already taken, I might set
my sights on him, even though I am much older than he is.&quot;

&quot;He's a shit!&quot;

&quot;Not all the time, but he is at the moment and I
think I'm going to tell him so. Come with me.&quot; Ellen grabbed Anne's wrist
and dragged her towards Geoff's room. Anne started to say something but Ellen
put her index finger to her lips. Ellen flung the door noisily open and
switched on the overhead light. It woke the pair from a light doze. &quot;Get
into the spare room!&quot; she ordered Marion. When she protested Ellen pulled
the smaller girl from the bed and dragged her to the door. &quot;Move!&quot;
she ordered and enforced the command with a sharp slap to Marion's rear. Ellen
pushed Anne to the bed. &quot;Geoffrey Williams this is your property. Look
after it in the way you should. It is one thing to punish her for wrong doings
but quite another to humiliate her by throwing her away for another at your
slightest whim. Even though you profess to own her, she is not a slave. She is
yours to train and care for. Now care for her! Goodnight!&quot;

Geoff was too bemused by the outburst to even reply
before the door closed and Ellen was gone. Anne, crying again, slipped into the
bed, hoping he wouldn't spank her for Ellen's actions. &quot;I didn't�&quot;
she started but Geoff just put his arm around her and pulled the covers up
around them. &quot;Ssssush,&quot; he whispered, &quot;We'll talk in the
morning.&quot;
