The Gamblers

The style was called �Anguish.� It was the
latest fashion rage�dress your woman in haute-couture, bind her in some minor
way, and then hurt her �just a little �just enough to draw out her beauty. It
looked sophisticated when it was done properly, with a light touch. 

This definitely was not the case for the
contract-girl across the aisle. Her look simply wasn�t working. She was just a
CELT of course, which allowed for a more daring presentation, but even so, one
could only get away with so much skin, so much pain. In my opinion, the mark of
a real sophisticate was subtlety. 

Not that this girl wasn�t beautiful, quite the
contrary, she was extraordinary�light brown skin, a face that could launch
ships, shoulder-length chestnut hair, a long graceful neck; and tall, maybe
five-ten, with an athlete�s perfectly sculpted body, one that came with hard,
consistent exercise. Someone had really worked this girl to get such a figure. 

It was difficult to nail down exactly what was
wrong with her look though. Every part of her presentation was correct if
slightly overdone; maybe that was it; maybe it was all just too much. 

Pleased with my sudden insight, I studied her
more closely over the top of my computer. She was sitting back on her heels,
wearing a white sundress. This was his first mistake�a sexy sundress wasn�t
appropriate for an airport waiting lounge. It just barely contained her full
breasts and revealed more of her well-rounded ass than it hid. That dress would
have worked fine in one of the island�s beach bars, but not here, not in the
semi-formal stiffness of the first-class lounge.

And those shoes! She had worn expensive fuck-me
heels that had been removed and were now at her side. I imagined her long legs
mounted on those platforms, yum. This was definitely a rich man�s sex-toy�but
why advertise it, I thought. Why, for instance, did he need to spread her
knees? A demure knees-together position would have been much more effective�a
modest counterpoint to her natural sexuality. 

I could see a black thong between her legs. It
barely covered the mound between her legs. I did have to admit thought that
this was sexy, especially the way it slipped into her crack, creating a pair
of, well �lips. I looked at her mouth then back to her cunt then back again to
her mouth and smiled. Both set of lips were exceptionally round and full. Just
right for warming somebody�s cock at both ends, I thought rudely. 

Maybe someday I�ll buy my own CELT. I wonder
what that would be like to own someone? This was a just a dream of
course�people like me didn�t traffic in women; we didn�t have anything to do
with the CELT business. Not only that, I didn�t have the personality for it. As
much as I denied it, even to myself, I wasn�t comfortable around girls. That�s
just the way it was, I thought sadly.

But I could still dream� I could feel myself
getting hard as I studied her long, almost prehensile toes. People said that
this was the problem with CELTs, they brought out the worst in men. 

Not that this aspect of contract-girls bothered
many people anymore. Consensual bondage was practically an institution now and
CELT contracts were common. Didn�t I just read that 5% of the women in the U.S. under thirty were CELTs? Legalization made sense, I
thought, with today�s overpopulation. People needed a way out of their poverty.
After a few years a CELT, which stood for Contracted Escort-Long Term, could
earn enough money to make a new life for themselves and often for their entire
family. This made sense to a lot of people, despite the moral issues.

Of course, only a tiny fraction of the world�s
billions, just the most beautiful, the healthiest, the smartest made it out
this way. Natural selection, I thought. Maybe this was why there was so much
prejudice against CELTSs? 

But still�even with a CELT good taste was
important. Just sitting there, his girl was giving half the room a hard-on.
That wasn�t right. Most sensible people tried to avoid trouble by downplaying
the sexual aspect of CELT ownership. This girl�s attire and her bondage were much
too risqu� for the lounge�more appropriate for a private men�s club or a
bondage bar, I thought prissily.

Nowadays, it wasn�t that unusual to see CELTs
bound, even hard-bound in public. (Although it was still shocking to some, it
was fairly common in Manhattan for example to see a girl being walked on a leash with her
arms bound. It was chic, fashionable�) 

This girl�s owner seemed to be trying for that
look. He had tied her wrists and elbows together behind her back with narrow
strips of soft white leather. Another strap had been wrapped twice around her
neck, almost like a fashionable choker. The leather was so supple that the ends
were simply tucked in, giving her that perfect no-knot look. I wondered if this
leather tightened when it dried, like rawhide; that would be something to watch
on this one, I thought evilly.

Despite the appropriateness of it all, I
grudgingly acknowledged that she looked incredible in her bondage�every man�s
fantasy slave-girl. As I said, it was just�too much. Her sexy bindings were
supposed to create an illusion, I thought. The �chocker� for example was making
her pant like a dog and the elbow tie was pulling her shoulders back much too
far. This wasn�t pain for fashion�s sake, it was torture.

Was I being too critical? The girl did look
valuable�something you would see in a French fashion magazine. She also looked
a little dangerous with that sleek, muscled body. Maybe the unusually harsh
bondage and all that bare skin were intended to create an altogether different
look�punishment for her haughtiness? Whatever, she was certainly stimulating a
lot of fantasies.

Unconsciously, my mind started to drift. I
imagined her with me in my shower. She was on her knees, wrists tied behind,
looking up at me with frightened glances as I deep-fucked her soft mouth. Her
luscious full lips gripped my cock hard and I could feel her throat muscles
moving rhythmically, swallowing to take me more fully inside. In my dream, I
reached down and pushed her away. She moaned in protest. 

I shifted in my seat and surreptitiously
repositioned my cock. 

Back in the shower, the girl looked up at me
confused, her mouth and tongue still moving, memory-fucking my cock. Fighting
the urge to reinsert myself, I reached behind her and lifted her bound wrists.
She scrambled to her feet, bending forward at the waist. I hooked a chain
hanging down from the shower�s ceiling to her wrists and then expertly tied her
forearms together.

I ran my hands along her back and flanks as I
moved to her rear.. She was up on her long toes, the ridges of her leg muscles
sharply outlined. I watched her struggle. The oversized mound between her legs
darkened as it filled with aroused blood.

I moved in from behind, pushing my cock
lengthwise between her pussy lips. I didn�t want to enter her just yet. By
instinct she inched forward on her long toes until she was over my cock and
then she pushed herself down. I heard her moan from the new pain in her arms.
Cruelly, I laughed and started to pull out. Her cunt tightened. It was a
delicious sensation, but I had another hole in mind this morning.

Squirting shampoo into her ass, I pointed my
cock and pushed. She cried out, squirming. But the pressure was unrelenting and
slowly I worked my way inside. In a few seconds she was fully impaled. Laughing
again, I grabbed a leather paddle hanging nearby and paddled her wet flanks.
Immediately, her squirming settled into a steady rocking motion�a gait. I
enjoyed this for a time and then gave her a single sharp whack. She responded
immediately, increasing her fucking speed to a slow trot. I waited a bit and
then did it again and again. Each time she went a little faster. When she
reached a full gallop, I exploded inside, triggering her orgasm. Quickly, I
shifted my hands to her stomach to enjoy the contractions of her rock-hard abs.

Glancing around the lounge, I shook off the
daydream. Even though no one had seen it, I was embarrassed. My cock was like a
piece of wood and I thought about going to the men�s room to jerk-off. No, I
thought, someone might walk in on me, but there was no going back to my
computer now. 

Instead, I resumed my furtive examination,
focusing on the outline of her bullet-like nipples pushing through the dress.
How did she get such large, hard points, I wondered? I didn�t think they were
artificial, she just looked too young and fresh. But was anyone really born
with such perfect nipples? What would it be like to grind them a little between
my teeth? �stop it, not again!

This was all just too much, I thought. No
wonder I�m sitting here getting off. This outrageous display was pushing me
beyond my limits. I could tell from their shifting eyes that the others in the
lounge, mostly vacationers and a few businessmen, had the same feelings.

In fact, the only person looking directly at
the CELT was a plain-looking newlywed a few seats away, and her gaze was pure
hate. Apparently, her new husband, a mousey man who was now studying his
golfing magazine with way too much intensity, had been caught looking. I
wondered what his married life was going to be like.

I shrunk down a little lower behind my laptop.
Where did such a perverse dream come from? There should be limits, I thought,
even for a fantasy. It wasn�t exactly my fault, though. The man who owned this
girl was the culprit! In another airport in another country, someone in
authority would have already spoken to him about their decency rules and about
public punishment of CELTs. But this was the Caribbean. Things were done differently around here. Most of the
time officials acted only when someone complained. 

Maybe the plain girl will say something, I
thought. Then again, why would she? She was probably enjoying the girl�s
suffering, which now appeared to be quite intense. Her neck strap was way too
tight.

Yes, she was definitely in trouble. I glanced
around. Maybe some bystander will intervene? Unlikely I thought the CELT�s
owner was an aggressive lout. This was obvious from the heated argument he was
having at the counter with a petite, but determined ticket agent, something
about a seat. Getting involved would probably result in an ugly confrontation
and for what? Technically, the man wasn�t doing anything wrong. She was just a
CELT.

Not only that, this was a public place. If she
was in real trouble, all she needed to do was to ask for help, just give us a
sign. Someone would help her. But uninvited, no; people in crowds just didn�t
act that way. No one wanted to interfere, to look foolish. Certainly not me;
I�d spent my entire life hanging back to avoid public mistakes.

This was really unusual though, I thought
again. Despite her distress, she wasn�t making a sound. Normally, a
contract-girl would be whimpering like a puppy by now. One of the people nearby
would then warn the man in the same way someone would tell him that something
was leaking from his luggage. Not a criticism, just one traveler helping out
another.

As I watched, I could see that she was actively
resisting this. She just wasn�t going to as for help. Strange�typically the
last thing a CELT wanted was to attract negative attention especially from
strangers. They prized their lucrative contracts and went to great lengths to
avoid even the hint of a serious problem. Problems might lead to a formal
complain, maybe even a legal action, maybe even contract nullification. This
was extreme rare of course, but the threat was real. I was glad I had decided
to stay out of it.

I�m a respectable banker for heaven�s sake, I
told myself, here on business. How would it look if I actually got mixed up in
something like this? I hadn�t even gone to the beach on this trip although I
had secretly watched the woman and the hard-bound, half-naked CELTs from my
balcony.

Maybe one day I could afford a discretely
hidden-away contract-girl of my�



Our eyes
met! She was staring at me. She was begging for my help, my personal help! I
panicked and for a second I couldn�t think. It was as if someone had touched me
with a live wire. Maybe I should notify the desk? Then again, she wasn�t really
asking for help, not in the right way. She�s supposed to whimper, whine; maybe
cry a little. This would allow someone to report her distress in the right way.
What could I possibly say, �Ah, excuse me, Sir; I�d like to talk to you about
the way you�re treating your CELT.� I�d look ridiculous. CELTs don�t just flash
their eyes at someone and make him their champion. Not only that, it would
embarrass and insult her owner, and no matter how big a jerk he was�

Anyway, the
rules were different for her. It wasn�t as if a normal person was in trouble.
Legally, she wasn�t much more than a pet. So what if she suffers a little. I
broke eye contact and starred down at the keyboard. Maybe she will get someone
else�s attention if I ignore her. I really don�t want to get involved in this.
I started to work feverishly on my spreadsheet. I had no idea of what I was
typing. I just didn�t want to get involved.

I typed
gibberish for almost a minute then I looked up. She was still watching me as
she worked to suck air into her lungs, but no longer pleading with her eyes.
Clearly, she had given up on me as her champion. I felt relief then, without
warning, she started to swoon; I could see her struggling desperately to take
in more air. After a few seconds, her color returned. There was perspiration on
her upper lip. She looked at me defiantly with her nostrils flared. Then she
turned away. 

This was
totally ridiculous. What could I do? Let the bitch suffer! This fucking CELT
had too much pride for her own good. She was bringing this trouble on herself.
I could feel myself getting angry. How dare she drag me, a total stranger, into
her problem?

No, it was
definitely better to just stay out of this. I resumed my nonsense typing. In
the back of my mind, however, I could hear a small voice repeating one word
softly over and over�coward�and deep inside I knew it was true.

�
II.



The man returned from the counter and sat down
on the lounge chair next to the girl. He was angry, shoving his ticket roughly
into a paper folder. I could see from the color of the folder that he was in
first class, same as me.

�Fucking airline,� he muttered to no one in
particular. I could tell that he was fuming. Then he looked at the girl and a
smile seemed to cross his face. Without a word, he sat forward on the edge of
his chair and moved his leg to hide the girl�s body. Reaching into his jacket
pocked, he extracted two round metal objects that looked like thick metal
washers. Careful not to let him see me looking, I studied them; they had sharp
triangular points on the inside rim and push-tabs on the outer edges.
Discretely, he pulled down the girl�s dress, squeezed the tabs, and pushed one
over her bare nipple. 

I was horrified. Her entire body stiffened and
her bare feet curled into claws. The first shock of pain lasted only a few
seconds, but to me it seemed to go on forever. Amazingly, she still didn�t make
a sound. Then he did the same to the other nipple with much the same effect.

Numb, I thought about what I had seen. Those
�washers� were actually circular nipple clamps, bondage toys. The pain must be
excruciating.

The man settled back in his chair, pleased with
himself. It was as if the girl�s pain had absorbed his anger. He seemed
unconcerned that his vicious act of pique would be noticed by anyone. 

I watched her out of the corner of my eye,
still pretending to be focused on my spreadsheet. Sheens of sweat now covered
her body and two trails of wet ran down the side of each tightly closed eye.
Appalled and still feeling ashamed, I hid my face behind my screen.

�Hey Pal,� he called to me casually across the
aisle. �Would you mind watching my stuff while I go to the John?� He pointed
with his thumb to his bags and the girl.

I looked up, trying to look innocent. �Sure,
sure no problem,� I said much too quickly.

�Thanks,� he said smiling. �Want me to grab you
a cup of coffee on my way back?�

�No thank you,� I said with the barest hint of
a judgmental tone. He looked me over as he stood up. Then, with a bit of
irritation, �don�t let anyone touch the girl, OK?� His meaning was clear. �and
keep your fucking hands off her as well. Then he seemed to think for a moment
and turned back to her to remove her neck strap.

Glancing down to my lap as he passed, he smiled
and gave a friendly knowing nod. Embarrassed, I realized that the computer had
slipped down and the bulge in my pants was showing. I readjusted the computer
and once again starred at the keyboard as if searching for a missing letter. 

I should have said something to him, I thought,
as he walked away, but who was I to criticize this stranger? She was his legal
property. It might not be very polite or appropriate to hurt her in an airport
lounge, but he certainly had the right� nothing to get very upset about. Was I
trying to provoke a confrontation? Again I had the sickening thought of trying
to explain my involvement to the people at work.

When I finally looked up, the girl was staring
at me again. The two wet streams drying on her face.� �Don�t let him rattle you,� she said softly.
�That�s what he does for a living�shakes people up enough so that they make
mistakes. I�m sorry I bothered you before. Please don�t tell him.� She seemed
frightened; apparently he was capable of a lot worse.

�No problem,� I said, trying to sound casual.
�Do they hurt?� Idiot! I thought immediately. �Do they hurt?� What a stupid
question.

She nodded. �He uses them a lot�� she paused as
another wave of pain passed over her face. This explains the shape of the
girl�s nipples, I thought insensitively. Frequent use of the clamps had trained
them into hard-points.

I was totally unnerved and before I could stop
myself, another stupid question had passed through my lips. �Why are you with
him?� I was appalled; it was a totally absurd and inappropriate thing to ask.
Her face froze and she was silent. Why was I being so incredibly dumb? In the
back of my mind I realized that I was trying to defend myself in her eyes. This
was stupid, I thought. She�s just a CELT; who cares what she thinks? 

She remained silent and despite my
rationalization, I felt terrible. One didn�t apologize to a CELT, but maybe in
this case� Fortunately, she raised her eyes and started to speak very softly
before I could put my foot back into my mouth.

�I didn�t contract directly with him, Sir. My
obligation was transferred.� Then she looked up defensively, �My family needed
the extra money; my brother was sick.�

I was surprised; not at her sob story, everyone
had one of those, but that she had a �transferable� contract. Almost all CELT
contracts were non-transferable. A transferable contract meant that you might
end up with a very nasty stranger, like this one. Three years of legal bondage,
the typical contract period, could feel like thirty in the wrong hands. Not
only that, but transferable contracts were much more difficult to reverse. The
courts had ruled a number of times that the consenting adults signing such
contracts generally accepted greater risks, and that bad treatment by itself
did not constitute grounds for reversal. (I had been interested in this subject
and studied the Consensual Bondage Laws of the 2120�s quite extensively while
in business school.)

Still acting the idiot and probably still
trying to salvage my pride, I pursed my lips and shook my head. Then, with a
critical air, my eyes shifted to the outline of the nipple clamps visible
through her dress. The meaning was clear�this is what happens to silly girls
who engage in such foolish behavior.

She looked at me for a moment and then bent her
head in silence. We had both said too much. In a few moments, the man returned.

After a time, the first boarding call was
announced. The man reached over, and removed her bindings. He left the nipple
clamps on under her dress and she made no attempt to touch them. She was well
trained, I thought. �Let�s go,� he said. Painfully, she got to her feet and
slipped on her sexy heels. Her legs were as magnificent as I had imagined. Then
bending down as modestly as she could, she picked up a leather bag and followed
him to the ramp, never looking in my direction. 

I was the last person in the lounge to board
the plane�too embarrassed and ashamed of myself to take the chance of
accidentally bumping into either of them again.




III.



Shit! What miserable fucking luck�the man was
in the seat next to mine. I checked my ticket again, 6E (fuck). I tried to slip
into my seat without being noticed.

�How you doing, partner?� he said in a friendly
way. The girl was on the floor at his feet. She was hugging her legs, her
wrists tied to her ankles. 

�Sorry �bout this, he said, pointing at her
with his thumb. �I tried to buy her a seat, but the plane is full. He glanced
around the full first-class cabin to illustrate the point. We�ll be a little
tight, but I�ll keep her on my side.�

�No problem,� I replied. �There�s plenty of
room in these seats. I�ll probably just work. You can let her move around a
little if you want.�

He smiled, �Thanks, Later.� Then he went back
to his magazine.

In a few minutes, the stewardess walked by and
stopped at our row. �Can I get either of you something to drink,� she asked.

�Nothing for me,� I said.

�I�ll have some Champaign, little lady,� the man said.

�Certainly,� she said. Then she noticed the
CELT. �I�m sorry, Sir. She�s going to need to be checked. We have some very
nice cages in the hold specifically designed for contract-girls. I can
gate-check her right here for you.� She started to reach into her apron pocket
for a check slip.

�Hold on, little lady,� he answered. �This
here�s a pretty valuable piece of property. I�d rather just keep her with me.�

�Sir,� now she was annoyed. �It�s regulations.
You can�t keep anything in the aisle. Everything, including this� this woman
must fit in the overhead or go under your seat. Otherwise it�s got to be
checked. This one is much too tall to go under the seat.� (Airlines now allowed
their first-class passengers to transport their CELTs in first class, but this
accommodation was really only for petite young girls. Some men liked their
CELTs small and tight, believing they were easier to handle and that the sex
was better.)

�She�ll fit,� he said, showing his own
annoyance now. �Maybe you can get me one of those CELT-belts.�

�I�ll get you a belt, Sir, but if she doesn�t
fit fully under the seat, I�ll need to insist that she be checked.� She wanted
to get the last word. In a few seconds, she returned with a long, wide belt and
handed it to him along with his drink. No words were exchanged.

�Frigid bitch,� he mumbled. �Would you mind
holding this, Partner?� He handed me his drink then he positioned the girl
between his legs and wrapped the belt around her legs and back and pulled hard.
The air went out of her lungs. Then he tightened the belt a little more and
buckled it. I could see it digging into her skin. 

He reached into his seatback pocket, breathing
a little heavily from the exertion. �This bitch is one fucking pain in the
ass,� he said as he unfolded a leather hood and placed it over her head,
tightening its built-in collar around her neck. Then he laid the girl down on
her knees and pushed her head-first under the seat in front with his feet. Her
short dress rode up her back, but he didn�t bother to pull it down.

�Nice, huh?� he said, pointing at her ass with
his toe.

�Can she breathe in that thing,� I asked,
forcing myself to speak casually.

�No, she�s just gonna have to hold her breath
for a while,� he said laughing. Then he fluffed up his pillow and turned away.

I watched her long toes curl and uncurl as she
settled into her confinement. It was clear that she could breathe through the
hood�s stitching, but it wouldn�t be pleasant or easy. It must also be getting
really hot in there, I thought. After a while, I looked away and sat back in my
seat for the takeoff. This was none of my business, I thought again. Stay out
of it. She�s just a CELT �a CELT with a transferable contract. That basically
makes her a prostitute, a whore.

The stewardess stopped by once to check. It was
obvious from her frown that the girl wasn�t really fully out of the aisle, but
the woman chose to ignore the infraction rather than start another argument. I
smiled at her for this small mercy.

The plane took off without further incident.

I spent the next hour staring at the girl�s
feet, wondering what it was like for her. The planes� interior had been
darkened and most of the passengers were sleeping when the man finally stirred.
Stretching, he turned on his overhead light, unfastened his seatbelt, and
pulled the girl out. After pausing for breath, he sat her upright on the floor
and removed her hood. Her face and hair were covered with sweat. Carelessly, he
wiped her off with a couple of drink napkins and then set her back against the
side of the plane still bound hand-to-foot.

��Scuze me, Partner,� he said. ��need to visit
the boy�s room.� I smiled and politely moved my legs aside to let him pass.

When he was gone, I looked over at the girl.
She was still trying to recover from the hood.

�He�s a character,� I said, trying to be
casually friendly.

She looked at me and smiled politely, but said
nothing. 

�He seems to know all the tricks.� I persisted,
not willing to be put off. She was silent. �He seems to know all the tricks,
right?� I repeated, annoyed.

�He�s a sadistic pig,� she answered. It was
obvious that this had just slipped out. Immediately she looked up, shocked at
her loss of control. 

For a moment neither of us said anything. Then
she started talking fast, much too fast. �Not that he�s done anything wrong,
Sir. Our contract, of course, gives him the right to treat me just about any
way he wants. He�s maybe a little too harsh. We just need more time to get used
to each other.�

She thought for a moment and then restarted her
rapid-fire monologue. �Please Sir, please, if you have one ounce of mercy in
you, please don�t tell him what I said.� It was obvious that she was afraid,
but it also appeared that beneath the surface, she resented the need to beg for
my help. 

I thought about this for a minute. Truthfully,
the responsible thing to do was to tell the man everything. If, God forbid,
something bad happened in the future and it was discovered that I could have
prevented it by warning him, I could be sued. An angry CELT is not a good thing
to have sleeping in your bed or even at the foot of it.

Still, was that necessary? It would get me
further entangled with these two. Shit, why couldn�t I have just kept my mouth
shut? I thought for a moment and then I had what seemed to be a good idea.
�Maybe you should speak to him. Your contract gives you the right to protest,
to contact your attorney. Why don�t you try that?� I suggested. My tone was
reasonable. 

She looked at me as if I were an idiot. �Why
should he talk to me? My contract has only a year to run. He knows I can�t end
it now. It would mean the loss of all further compensation,� then her eyes
filled, �and that would mean the end of my family, the death of my brother.�
She was getting worked up again, emotional; exactly what I was trying to avoid.


�Yes, I guess that is a problem.� I said
dismissively.

I didn�t have an answer for her and, more
importantly, I didn�t want to get into a heavy discussion with a CELT whore.
She was nothing to me. Why was I even bothering to talk to her; it was stupid.
She had created her own problem; complaining about it afterward made her what,
a cheat? I stopped talking.

She glared at me and suddenly I was glad she
was tied. In a low voice, she started talking again. �Yes, it�s a problem�� She
wasn�t hiding her anger now, and most of it was directed at me. How did I get
into this mess!

�Let me tell you what he did to me last night.�
She was whispering, but every word was sharp. �He made me strip down to a thong
that he likes, tied my arms behind, and locked my ankles together with a short
hobble-chain. He likes to watch me run.� Her voice dropped even lower. �Then he
put his Piranhas on me. That�s what they�re called, Piranhas. I know you saw
them tonight. It�s like being eaten alive.�

She paused for a second to regain some
composure. �He attached a Y-leash and walked me around the hotel, stopping at
every party to check out the action. Can you imagine what its like to be
displayed naked on a leash� with women watching! At one party, he put me on my knees
then he tied the leash to a coat rack and hooked the hobble-chain to my wrists.
I had to balance myself with my nipples. Everyone thought it was hilarious.�

�Maybe you should try that with your cock,
Computer-Boy, before you criticize me. They make Piranhas for men, you know.�
She stopped and started to cry. They were silent tough-guy tears, but the way
she wiped them off on her knees reminded me of a little girl.

�Look, I�m sorry,� I said in a whisper. I was
doing what all men do when faced with tears�lie. �I didn�t mean to put you down
before; it�s just that this is none of my business. It�s also not right for you
to talk that way about your contract owner. As you said, he can do whatever he
wants with you. In fact, if I don�t tell him about this conversation and
something happens, I could be sued.�

She wiped off her tears and looked at me with
absolute loathing. �Go ahead, tell him,� she spit it out. �Maybe he�ll punish
me right here and the two of you can get off. A cowboy-sadist and a Wall
Street-coward, you two could be great friends.� She starred at me defiantly. We
both jumped when the man appeared in the aisle.

He was carrying a glass of ice and four small
bottles of vodka. �I raided the liquor closet,� he said jovially, ignoring the
tension that was hanging between us. �She�s a good looker, no? He glanced at me
as he moved sideways back into his chair.

�Yes,� I said red-faced, �very nice.� I started
to reach for my computer, trying to avoid any more conversation. This flight
was turning into a nightmare. 

But now the man was fully awake and talkative.
�Won her a few weeks ago in a card game,� he said in a conspiratorial whisper
as he poured his first drink. �Fella was drawing to an inside straight. He was
so happy to make it that he thought he owned the pot and bet the farm,
including her. Bad way to play! I had a full house from the get-go. He never
knew what hit him. �been fucking her every night,� he added. ��amazing muscles,
good moves �I just needed to teach her some manners. Now she�s okay. Amazing
things they got these days to keep these CELT bitches in line.�

I thought about the Piranhas.

�Yup� I got an electric whip in my bag that I
used on her a couple of time. It hurts like Hell, but it don�t make any marks.
�copper�s woven right into the leather braid. You don�t need to kill yourself,
even a light stoke gets her full attention.� Glancing over to be sure I was
listening, he continued, �Best thing is to put them up by their wrists and get
them on their toes. Then put a good gag on �em and you�re in for some real fun.
Jesse here is strong and defiant. She�ll kick for half-an-hour�maybe 20 strokes
with the electric whip.� He paused and took a sip of his drink. �Can�t go too
fast with the power turned up, you know; they�ll pass out on you�got to give
�em time to rest.�

He lowered his voice and moved a little closer.
�You also want her conscious when you�re finished. That�s the best time to fuck
�em you know�right after, when their brain�s still sparkin�. Give you a real
ride.� He laughed and, not knowing what else to do, I smiled and nodded my head
in agreement. 

The girl looked up at me. I knew what she was
thinking. This made me a little angry. No one, not even me, likes to be called
a coward, especially by a stranger�a CELT. This bitch was purposely
antagonizing me and I impusively, I asked him, �What do you do when she
complains about you�to other people?� The girl�s face turned white. Not
shooting off your mouth now are you, bitch? I thought.

He glanced at Jesse then said, �Naw�Jesse
wouldn�t do that. She knows that I won�t put up with that kind of foolishness.
If she did that to me, I�d whip her hard for days. I know exactly how much she
can take; I could easily keep her screaming for a week.

He looked at me hard. �She didn�t bother you
with any tall tales while I was in the John, did she Partner?� he asked. I knew
that he was watching to see if I glanced at the girl. 

�No. No, she didn�t say anything to me,� I
lied. �I was just wondering.� I never blinked or took my eyes off his.

�That�s good, real good,� he said slowly. His
jovial mood returned and he paused to sip his drink. Then he looked over at her
again, �Got to keep that whip oiled up, right Jess. Don�t want the leather to
stiffen up.� Then he turned back to me, �The best thing for a whip is the oil
from a girl�s skin. I know you think I�m shittin� you, but it�s true. Just keep
turnin� the whip to make sure it covers every part.� 

�Probably sell her contract when I get back,�
he continued. �She�s too much trouble, too much baggage for my line of work�
There are plenty of girls around to rent. No need to carry my own around with
me. Am I right?�

�What line of work is that,� I asked, ignoring
his question and trying desperately to now sound friendly. (I was thinking
about the pain my vicious little remark might cause her.)

�Well, I�m pretty much retired now, but I do
some gambling from time to time. Keeps life interesting, you know. You ever
play?� It sounded like a question he had asked many times before. 

�No, not really,� I said. �Well, sometimes,
just for fun.�

�Tell you what,� he leaned over, there was
vodka on his breath. �How would you like to play for this here girl? I �seen
you eying her. She�d make a great bed-warmer. And like I said, she�s strong and
tough�takes a lot of pain.� 

I looked at him, knowing that he was joking,
putting me on. �What�s she worth,� I asked, playing along.

��bout a hundred grand now, still got another
year or so to run on her contract.� He was bragging, showing off.

I nodded my head, smiling, still going along
with the joke. Then my mouth opened and I heard myself saying, �OK, I�ll bet
you a hundred thousand dollars, against her contract. One cut of the cards.� 

I couldn�t believe my ears. What was I doing!
In a panic, I realized that a quick laugh would make the statement sound like a
joke. I needed to laugh! Laugh, you fool! 

But something held me back. It was the only
truly brave thing I had ever done.

The girl looked at me, openly curious. The
man�s eye�s narrowed and he put his face close to mine. �I was just kidding,
Partner.� then he leaned back in his seat and was quiet for a few seconds,
sipping his drink. 

Slowly, he turned to me and asked, �You got a
hundred thousand dollars, Kid?�

�Yes.� I said simply, holding his gaze.
Actually, I had $108,000�my life�s savings. WHAT WAS I DOING!

The man looked at me for a long moment. I held
my breath, maybe he would laugh the whole thing off. Then he glanced at the
girl. Guilt was written all over her face. He knew immediately that we had done
more than talk; he also knew that most of that talk had been about him. I could
see him turn a little red in anger.

He nodded and looked back at me. Then he
smiled. The girl was going to be whipped exactly as he had described. A
personal insult was an important thing for him. She realized it at the same
time and trembled. She knew difference between casual pain and real punishment.

But now he wanted something from me as well. I
had apparently violated some unwritten gambler�s code.

�OK, Pal. You come up with the dough and it�s a
bet.� His tone was no longer friendly, it was distinctly hostile.

I hid my fear. Maybe I could just laugh now,
roll over and go to sleep. Who cares what this creep thinks or says? So he
punishes her�so what. The truth is that she deserves it. Well, maybe she
doesn�t deserve being whipped for a week; and maybe I was partially responsible
for egging her on, but so what? �just a CELT, remember!

Every logical part of my brain desperately
wanted me to laugh it off and forget it, forget about her. But I just couldn�t
do it. Without thinking, I reached into my wallet and retrieved my debit card.
I swiped it through the seatback reader with a shaking hand. Using a few
keystrokes on the seat�s built-in computer, I moved a hundred thousand dollars
into an escrow account and assigned it a password, writing it secretly on a
paper napkin. He watched all this with a smirk on his face.

�You sure seem to know what you�re doing with
that banking stuff,� he said. Then he stood up and pulled his large leather bag
out of the overhead locker. Unzipping an outside pocket, he found the girl�s
contract. I could see that it already had several transfer endorsements on the
back.

�She sure is going to look good at your feet if
you win,� he said. �I�m also gonna throw in everything in this bag. You�ll need
this stuff to keep her in line.� I could tell that I was being worked now. He
smelled my money. I was now his pigeon or whatever gamblers call their prey.

�Thanks,� I said quietly, glancing at the girl.
This is lunacy, I thought. I was about to lose my life�s savings for an exotic
pet, a whore. 

�Well, OK!� he said emphatically, ringing the
call button. In a few seconds the same stewardess appeared. �Ma�am, would you
mind getting my friend and me a pack of your best playin� cards?� She nodded
stiffly and went for the cards. We waited in silence.

When the cards arrived, he shuffled them on the
divider between our seats. His hands moved like a magician�s. I was glad this
was a simple cut of the deck.

�You know what,� he said, placing the deck
between us. �Let�s bring Jesse into this.� Reaching into his bag, he pulled out
the Piranhas. Then he retrieved a large ball gag that he had stuffed in the
seatback. Moving the girl between his legs, he pushed the gag into her mouth
and tightened it behind her neck. Then he quickly pulled down her dress and
placed the Piranhas on her nipples. Reaching back into the bag, he found a high
leather collar. I knew this was for discipline. 

�What are you doing?� I asked. 

�You can let her out when you win,� he said,
positioning the collar on her neck.

�And if I lose?� I asked. 

�Then you can watch her for the next three
hours,� he replied. He had buckled the collar so tightly that her face had
turned red. She wasn�t getting enough air. 

�Look, there�s no reason for this,� I said,
starting to panic. The girl was barely able to breathe. A blunt point at the
top of the collar kept her head high so that she was staring directly at me. I
was reminded of the scene at the airport. 

He was having sadistic fun with both of us and
enjoying himself. He was also continuing to work me, ensuring that I had yet
another reason to continue with the bet. 

�OK, I�ll tell you what, partner,� he said
reasonably. �Once our bet is finished, I�ll let her out.� I knew it was a lie.
Once he won, we would both be at his mercy. Jesse would stay in the collar
until she passed out, then he would devise some other torture for her. He
wanted us to suffer and he knew that punishing her was painful to me as well.
The girl looked over at me with her mouth open, breathing hard. She was now
working hard to survive.�

I smiled at her reassuringly, but I felt sick.

�Come on, Kid,� he urged. �Don�t lose your
balls now. This one�s tough. She can take it, can you? Worry about yourself.
It�s your money.�

What a vicious bastard, I thought. I can�t let
him whip her for a week because of something I did.� 

�OK,� I said, defiantly. �Let�s get this over
with.�

He smiled again and turned to the girl. �You
got yourself a real champion here, Jess. Man�s willing to put up a hundred
thousand dollars to keep your pretty ass from a little punishment.�

He was absolutely gleeful. �My name�s Max, by
the way, Max Springer,� he said as he held out his hand. ��and this here is
Jesse. I don�t like to gamble with strangers.�

�I�m Howard Lowe,� I said, returning his
handshake with a limp wrist. My face was ashen and despite my earlier resolve,
I was afraid.� 

�Howard,� he repeated, turning the name around
scornfully in his mouth. Now, he was really enjoying himself. Then he pulled
the Piranhas out of his pocket and held them up for both of us to see. �These
little babies are amazing,� he said, pushing on the side tabs and demonstrating
the pinching movement of the inside points. �And the name really fits. They can
really bite.� 

He slipped Jesse�s dress down to her waist. She
sat on the floor half naked, bound, and gagged. We both looked down at her from
our plush seats. She starred back at us unashamed. Grabbing one of her breasts,
Max held it tight as he pushed the Piranha over her nipple and slowly released
the tabs. Jesse closed her eyes and absorbed the pain. I could see that it was
a lot worse now since her nipples were already sore. Max would have known that.

He watched her anguished face for a moment and
then did the same to her other breast. Pulling her dress back up, he muttered,
�We�ll leave that up. Don�t want upset that stewardess, now do we?�

He whispered to the girl loudly enough for me
to hear, �You�ll be okay, Jesse. Just keep thinking about how much worse it
will be when we get home. She held my eyes. I could see fear; this was no idle
threat. The man really was a sadistic pig, just as she had said.

�I hate to see her cry,� he said then he
smiled.

That was when I lost my nerve. �Let me ask you
a question,� I said with a shaky voice. �Suppose I just buy out her contract.
You said you were thinking about selling it anyway, this way we both end up
with what we want.� This wasn�t true at all, I thought. All I wanted was my
hundred thousand dollars safely back in my account and to be free of this mess.

He looked at me like the street fighter that he
really was. �That might have been OK before, kid, but then you and Jess here
went and made this personal. Personal is no good. This girl is my property. You
fucked with her head without my permission. Now she�s goin� have to pay for her
mistake and yours too.�

His arrogance put some steel in my back. I
looked him in the eyes and even managed to exhibit a bit of bravado, �Well
then, all that�s left to do is cut the cards.� It was all show; I was scared
and I knew he was going to win. 

Placing the cards down, he gestured with his
hand for me to take my cut. I managed to nod in his direction�you first. 

Smiling, he reached down and cut the deck�a
Jack. He just smiled, leaned down, and showed the girl the card. Her eyes
rolled and I thought she had fainted, but then her eyes opened and she looked
at me. It was the look of someone condemned; I had sent her to Hell. �I�ll
charge up the whip�s batteries as soon as we get home, Jess, so you can start
your week right.� He was enjoying every moment of this.

Then he looked over at me, �Your card,
How-word.�

I ignored his jibe, but my hand was shaking so
badly that I had trouble cutting the deck. I didn�t even look at the card I�d
drawn, just faced it towards him. He looked down from my eyes to the cards,
smiled broadly, and leaned back in his chair happy. I had lost! 

I was devastated. Three year�s savings gone in
a second and a week of vindictive torture for a girl who had just asked me for
a little help. Surprisingly, the money didn�t seem all that important anymore
as I thought about Jesse�s beautiful body writhing at the end of this asshole�s
whip.

Oh man, what had I done? I felt sick.

Numb, I checked the card in my hand to see how
close I had come. It was the queen of hearts. The queen of� THE QUEEN!

Max looked at me unfazed. �Looks like you won,
Kid. Congratulations.� He picked up the contract, wrote in my name as owner and
signed it. Then he put it back in the bag and gestured for us to change seats.
Once he was settled, he casually rolled over and went back to sleep. Gamblers
don�t linger at a losing table.

I was dumbfounded and sat there for some time
enjoying the relief that coursed through my body. Then I remembered the girl
and moved to her aid. I swore to myself that she would never suffer in my
hands.

Reaching down, I removed her gag and then as
gently as I could I took off the Piranhas and put them back in the bag. I tried
not to touch her breasts, but of course that was unavoidable. She was crying
softly. I wiped her face and untied her hands and ankles. Still crying a little
she moved in between my feet and rested her head on my lap. I could feel her
arm inching forward to find a secure place between legs. I pushed the hair out
of her face and then got instantly hard when I saw her mouth so near my cock.
She probably noticed, but I didn�t care. We had won! 



When we
started to descend, she turned around and positioned herself for the belt. I
put it back on and gently moved her halfway under the seat. Of course, I didn�t
use the hood. 

Max, who had
slept for most of the trip, finally woke up as we were landing and watched us
with his now-famous smirk. When the plane arrived at the gate, he stood up and
gave me a quick goodbye handshake. �You are the man, Howard,� was all he said.
Then he was gone. 

At the time,
I thought it was just a Max-like dumb thing to say. Later, I would regard those
four words as precious wisdom �most precious wisdom. 


IV.



�May I change my clothes, Master?� she asked.

We were standing outside the arrival gate at
JFK. With the sundress exposing her bare shoulders and long legs, she was
getting lecherous stares from the male passersby. I was embarrassed. �Look,
ah�Jesse, please don�t call me that; my name is Howard. And you don�t need my
permission to change your clothes. That life is over for you. I�m a decent
person, I don�t treat women badly.�

She looked at me with a strange expression.
�Thank you, Ma� Thanks, Howard. There are some jeans and a top in this bag. Maybe
I could wear them?� 

�That would be fine,� I said. She just stood
there holding the bag. I was confused. �Go ahead,� I urged.

She glanced at my shyly and said, �I�m not
permitted to open it.� It was ridiculous, but I guess once you�ve been whipped
for something, you learn.

�Look, I said, you don�t�� then I stopped,
frustrated. This wasn�t the place to have this conversation. Bending down, I
opened the bag and handed her a pair of jeans and a top. She walked off to the
ladies room. In a few minutes she was back. I held my breath. She looked like a
New York fashion model, totally unapproachable. I could see that
people were still staring at us� at her. She was movie-star gorgeous.

Quickly, I steered us to a cab line and we
jumped in. �Twenty-Eight East 79th Street,� I said to the driver,
then added a �please.� He nodded and drove off. We sat in total silence for the
entire trip, both of us overwhelmed by the events of the last few hours. 

I live in a Manhattan townhouse. When we arrived, I saw that she was surprised.
She had expected an apartment. I turned on some lights and directed her to the
library and a wooden chair in front of my desk. I took the seat behind the
desk.

�Let me explain a few things to you, Jesse. I
was trying to be very businesslike. I�m not rich. This is my Grandfather�s
house; it�s owned by a family trust. I have the right to use it, but not to
sell or rent it. I also have a small trust that pays me a little allowance each
month. That�s all my Grandfather left me. In other word, I�m not rich.� I
paused and let her absorb what I�d just said. �Do you understand?� I didn�t
want her to think I was�a mark.

She nodded. 

�I live here alone, by choice,� I continued.
Actually, the choice part wasn�t really true. �I don�t socialize much� too busy
at work.� �this was getting too personal. �I just don�t have that many
relationships,� I said, stupidly ending my clumsy explanation of why a 25
�year-old, townhouse-owning, reasonably good looking, tall, eligible man was
living alone in Manhattan.

She nodded again, while she looked around the
room and then asked the obvious question, �Are you gay?�

�No,� I replied, a little hurt for some reason.
I hurried on. �You can stay here while we take care of the legal work. There
are plenty of extra bedrooms. Tomorrow, I�ll call my lawyer and get him started
on your emancipation.�

�Emancipation?� she asked.

�Yes, emancipation. There�s no way that I can
hold on to your contract. I work in a bank, a vice president. It wouldn�t look
right. Not that I wouldn�t want to be�associated with you, any man would,
you�re beautiful. It�s just that in my position, with my family�it would just
be, well inappropriate. Even though what happened tonight was all innocent, it
would be just too hard to explain. Don�t worry; I�ll make sure that you get
paid the full amount agreed to in the contract.�

She was quiet for a moment. �I�m sorry about
what I said before in the plane, Master �ah, Howard,� she was looking down.
�The pain was getting to me. Thank you for your help in working things out with
Mr. Springer. I know it�s inappropriate to say such things, but he was an
animal. It was a brave and generous thing to do.�

We both knew that this little speech was
bullshit�for the most part, I had let her down time after time�but it was
easier for us to accept the picture the way she had just painted it. If I had
just left it there, things would have worked out much differently, instead my
mouth began again. 

�I�m not sure how long the legal work will
take, but if you�re okay with it, we can just pretend that you�re my live-in
girlfriend for a few days. This way, when you leave, I can just say we broke
up. As I said, I haven�t had much time for girls, but people will accept this
explanation. The last thing I want is for anyone to know that I owned a CELT
contract. Even though I didn�t do anything wrong, I don�t want to have to
explain this, ever.� I paused again.

�Or, if you�d rather stay at a hotel, I can
make a few calls and we can move you in tomorrow. You won�t need to worry about
the expenses; I�ll pay for everything.�

�In either case, I�ll treat you with the utmost
respect and, of course, there won�t be any physical abuse. I find that
reprehensible. Hopefully, Max is the last man who will ever� Anyway, for all
practical purpose, we can consider your CELT contract ended right now. You are
my guest.�

I smiled in what must have looked like a
self-righteous way and sat back in the chair. She looked at me with a strange
expression and in a matter-of-fact tone said, �Won�t we need to fuck, Howard, if
we�re going to be boyfriend and girlfriend?� Was there a hint of sarcasm in her
voice?

Her directness surprised me, and I needed a
moment to recover. Don�t forget, I told myself, she�s little more than a street
whore even though she looks like a model. 

�No, we don�t need to do that, Jesse,� I said
slowly, thinking that she may be relating to this kind of decent treatment
after what she�d been through. I also had the idea that she might not be that
bright. �We�re only going to act like lovers, but in truth we�ll just be
employer and employee. You�re an escort, remember? Someone people hire because
they don�t want to go places alone.� We both knew that that was also bullshit;
CELT escorts were sex-partners, mistresses.

�Do you understand what I�ve told you?� It was
almost the tone one would use with a child. Maybe she was stupid?

�Yes I understand, Howard,� she began with
equal patience. �It�s just that people always seem to know when a couple is
fucking� someone might suspect something. Maybe you should think about it;
fucking me might actually be the safest thing, reputation-wise.� She was
copying my parent-child tone; she also sounded a little angry. Why?

�And when you say, �no physical abuse� though,�
she continued, �you mean, unless I deserve it, right? It wouldn�t make sense
for you to allow me to go without any discipline. Didn�t you and Max agree that
the best way to handle one of us was to, and I quote, �put them up by their
wrists and get them on their toes�.shove in a good gag and you�re in for some
real fun. This one�will kick and jerk for half-an-hour�� You seemed to be
listening very hard. Oh, and I almost forgot his most important suggestion,
�fuck her while her brain is still sparking.� Isn�t that what you and he
agreed?� She was definitely angry now. This was not going at all the way I
expected.

�Look Jesse, I don�t think you understand�� I
started again.

��and by the way, Howard,� she interrupted; �I
fast-tracked my way through high-school and college, graduating from NYU at 20
with a bachelor�s degree in psychology. So, don�t keep asking me if I
understanding you. I said my family was in trouble, I didn�t say that I�d been
poor and dumb all my life.� 

�Let�s be honest with each other,� she
continued, clearly angry now. �You didn�t have the nerve to help me when I
needed you, but now I�m supposed to believe that you�re going to do the right
thing for the sake of your reputation �your family; you�re going to throw away
a hundred thousand bucks.�

�And what makes you think I want to be
emancipated?� she asked. �Don�t you think the next man who buys my contract is
going to wonder why I was set free early? Are you going to give him an
affidavit attesting to your good will? CELTs are worth a lot, people don�t just
give them away without a good reason.�

�You didn�t act out of honor or sympathy,
Howard; you were distracted by that bulge in your pants and acted impulsively.
It�s that simple. Once you had backed yourself into a corner, you just followed
the path of least resistance. It was all an accident that worked out okay for
you. Once you have had some time to think it over, you�ll come to your senses
about me.� She was calming down.

�It�s not that I don�t appreciate what you did,
Howard. Some of it truly was brave and Max really was a pig.� She paused and
looked at me.

�Take my advice,� she leaned forward as if to
emphasize her next words. �Tie me up and hurt me a little over the next few
days�just so you can see what its like. I�m sure you�ll like it. If you want,
you can fuck me as well or I can suck your cock. Then, when you�ve had your
fill, sell my contract. That�s what most men in your position would do. Believe
me, I know. You won yourself a contract-girl worth a hundred thousand dollars
tonight, Howard, enjoy her. As for the contract itself, I agree that it would
be impossible for you to hold on to it, someone of your standing, but don�t
give it away.�

She leaned back and smiled at me with a
now-doesn�t-this-make-sense expression.

I was hurt. I guess I had started to think of
�us� as a team. She was right to set things straight. I would never hurt her,
of course, and there was no way that I would force her to do anything sexual,
but she was right about the money. Holy shit, in the last few hours I had
doubled my net worth. Tripled it really if you adjusted for the taxes I didn�t
need to pay. (I knew that Max wasn�t going to claim any of this on his taxes.)

I was also extremely tired. �I�m not exactly
sure why I did any of the things I did tonight, Jesse, but I�m not the kind of
man who would take advantage of such a situation.� Let me take you to your
room,� I said this last with finality. �We�ll straighten all of this out
tomorrow.�

I left the house the next morning early, before
she was awake. I wrote her a brief note saying that she should make herself at
home and that if she wanted, we could go to dinner that evening and talk. I
also left her some cash to do some shopping. (She didn�t seem to have many
clothes.)

I put the evening�s discussion to the back of
my mind. She had been tired and stressed. I should have waited to talk to her.
She seemed like a decent person in a bad situation. We would get it all worked
out tonight. In the meantime, I�d get things started by talking to my lawyer
about her contract. Once she really understood the kind of person I was, it
would be easier for us to talk.

The office was in chaos over something or other
and I was in meetings for the entire day. It was a blessing in a way to be
distracted from the �Jesse problem.� Unfortunately, I didn�t get a chance to
calling my lawyer. 






&nbsp;

V.



That evening when I got home, she met me at the
door dressed in black pants and a white silk top. The pants hugged her behind,
highlighting her long legs. The outfit included a short jacket that made her
small waist look tiny. She was a classy dream� a Park Avenue debutant� no one would ever guess that she was a CELT.

�Is this okay, Howard?� she asked innocently.

�It�s perfect,� I replied enthusiastically. My
relief was enormous. I wanted to kiss her and more, but held back. We hardly
knew each other.

She waited and then leaned over and kissed me
on the cheek. �Thank you, again,� she said. Then she began to describe her day
as we walked to my bedroom. She was effervescent, bubbling over with
enthusiasm, talking lightly all the way to my door where she waited modestly
while I got dressed. 

Being in New York City with time and money was an exciting experience, especially
for a stunningly beautiful young girl. I knew that she would have been
propositioned at least half-a-dozen times. In fact, a part of me thought that
she might be gone when I got home, contract or not. 

For the next hour we talked continuously
without saying anything important. I forgot that she was a professional escort
and despite my clumsiness around women, I felt a real rapport growing between
us. She made everything easy and fun and there was no mention of yesterday�s
events or the prior evening�s discussion. It was as if we were old friends.

Dinner was even better. We talked about
everything and nothing; it was a real date. It turned out that she was 22,
three years younger than me. Her family was from California with Russian roots. She had originally come to New York to get the East Coast educational experience. It was fun
to talk about the stuff we�d done in college, and to exchange opinions on just
about everything.� She was incredibly
sharp and smart, much smarter than I had imagined. For the first time in a long
time, I was having fun.

Later, over coffee we discussed her
�situation.� She was open and unembarrassed. After college, she had been
looking for a job when her father had been accused of embezzlement. Between the
legal fees and fines, the family, which had been reasonably well off, lost
almost everything. He went to prison for eight years. Two month�s later her brother
was diagnosed with cancer. The treatments needed to keep him alive were costly.
She tried everything, but the only way she could get enough money for him was
to become a CELT. Even then, the non-transferable contracts didn�t pay enough,
so she needed to agree to the more lucrative transfer clause. Such a contract
had come easily with her looks.

The only sad moment in our conversation was
when she talked about her mother and brother, who she had not seen for two
years. Apparently, both had naturally fought her decision to become a CELT,
calling his illness �God�s will.� When she refused to listen, they broke all
contact with her. Her money was now funneled to them through a charitable
foundation which, on her strict orders, took full credit for the charity. There
was no bitterness in the explanation. �Just my bad luck,� she said with a sad
smile.

Stupidly, I asked her if she was happy as a
CELT. She looked at me almost with pity and then said, �Some parts of it are
OK, like now. Others are a nightmare. Most women, for example, look at me as if
I were a used condom.� She looked around the room at the other diners.

�It doesn�t help to think about things in terms
of �happy� or �sad,� Howard. It doesn�t work that way. I just try to get
through each day, one at a time, and deal with what comes along. As I said,
some are good, other days I would be very happy to die. Unfortunately that
option isn�t available to me�CELT contracts terminate on accidental death or
suicide.� There was no self-pit in the explanation.� 

�That part of your life is over, really Jess, I
mean it,� I reassured her. �It�s unbelievable to me that anyone could mistreat
a beautiful and talented girl like you.� She just smiled and nodded. Then she
asked me about �my story.�

It was boring by comparison, but she encouraged
me to talk. I told her about my family, which was wealthy; my job, which had
been arranged through family connections at the bank; and about my
Grandfather�s Manhattan townhouse, which he had left for me, his fifth grandson,
to use. I explained that even though I was �from money� and might someday
inherit something from my parents, I wasn�t rich myself�just an ordinary
working guy with a fabulous Manhattan townhouse and a small but regular trust-fund allowance.
Encouraged, I talked even about the little things�private school in Boston,
summers in Rhode Island, high-school football, tennis (and my small triumph
getting to the Northeast College League�s Semi-Finals), and my few love
affairs, all of which had ended unhappily.

She related to everything, laughing and sighing
at just the right times. It was as if we were best friends, catching up with
each other�s lives.

Then it was time for desert.

�I�ll have a piece of blueberry pie a la mode,�
she told the waiter. 

�And I�ll take the chocolate mousse,� I said. 

�Did you take care of the contract today,
Howard?� she asked in the same carefree tone she had used all evening.

�No, sorry, I didn�t get around to it. The
office was a madhouse today. I�ll take care of it first thing in the morning,�
I promised cheerfully. I had romance on my mind and felt sure that we would be
lovers tonight.

She smiled. �Thanks for this evening. I�m sorry
I was such a bitch last night. You�ve been wonderful.� Then her voice lowered
to a whisper. �And thanks as well to that wonderful queen-of-hearts. If it
wasn�t for her, I�d be hanging from Max�s rope right now, dancing to his whip.�
This was the first time she had directly referred to the B&amp;D part of a
CELTs life. I was amazed at how casually she could talk about such a horror.

�Let�s not talk about that stuff, Jess. I hate
to even think of you being hurt that way. Anyway, its ancient history, no one
is ever going to hurt you again,� I promised.

She nodded and smiled. �You promise?� she said,
reaching for my hand. �Not even a little spanking?� She was obviously just
teasing me, but the thought of it was stimulating� �Maybe you can tie me up in
the shower, Howard, and make me suck your balls. Men seem to like that.�

I was shocked! This was pretty crude talk for
two people basically on a first date. I was also disturbed that she had guessed
the kind of thing that was on my mind; the shower scene was one of my strongest
sexual fantasies. 

But I answered with equal nonchalance as if she
were joking, �Nope, nothing; as you will see, I�m a perfect gentleman.�

�There are no perfect gentlemen, Howard,� she
said carefully, �only those too repressed or too scared to give free rein to
their real feelings.� Then her voice lifted and she laughed, �You seem a little
repressed yourself, Howard. I�ll bet you a kiss that I could turn you into a
Max-like sadist in an hour.�

I laughed with her and replied, �That�s just
about the last thing I want to be, but feel free.� I was still joking around,
trying to get us back to a normal conversation. �I hope Max has gotten over
losing last night. I suspect that you were his walking bankroll for his next
game.� 

She nodded then our deserts arrived.
�Pie-a-la-mode for the lady and chocolate mousse for the gentleman,� the waiter
intoned.

�Excuse me, Sir,� Jesse said pleasantly to the
waiter. �I ordered the apple pie.�

�No Miss, I�m sure you ordered the blueberry,
but I will be happy to bring you apple instead,� he said politely.

�No, I ordered the apple,� she insisted, her
voice still pleasant. 

�Well, maybe you did,� he said in a placating
way, humoring her. �In any case, I�ll be happy to swap it for you.�

I could see that she was getting annoyed. �I�ll
tell you what,� she said, �since you want to be right so badly, let�s just say
that this fucking pie is your fucking tip.� She was talking loudly enough now
so that people in the surrounding tables started turning their heads.

�Jesse,� I said, �Take it easy, it�s not worth
getting upset over.�

�Sorry, I just don�t like people who can�t
admit a mistake,� she was perfectly cool, but determined. �Like this asshole
here.�

That was when the waiter made a fatal mistake.
�Look Miss, maybe it will mean my tip, which I can�t afford to lose, but you
ordered the blueberry. I�m certain of it.� Now everyone was glancing over.

She looked at him for a moment and then seemed
to collect herself. �Yes, I guess it�s possible that I said blueberry without
thinking.� I was relieved and the small room seemed to breathe a collective
sigh of relief; finally she was being reasonable. I hated scenes. �Maybe you�re
right. I�m really sorry, Sir. I like blueberry too, why don�t you just leave
it?� 

The waiter gave a little bow and turned around.
The next few seconds seemed to move in slow motion. Horrified, I watched as she
dumped the pie into her hand, stood up, and smeared it over the back of his
white jacket. 

For half a second the room froze then it was
pandemonium. Everyone was shouting and moving at the same time. After a time, I
managed to pull Jesse into the foyer to deal with the manager. It took every
ounce of personal charm I had to get out of there without police action. Of
course, the two hundred-dollar bills I passed the waiter for his cleaning bill
and tip didn�t hurt.

�Why the fuck did you do that?� I asked her
angrily in the cab, confused at the sudden turn of events. 

�I hate liars,� she replied with amazingly
calm.

�And that�s the way you show it�by going crazy
in public.� I was incensed.

�That waiter was a liar, just like you!� She
looked at me with eyes blazing. I was amazed at the transformation. Twenty
minutes ago we were like two kids on a first date.

�You promised me that you would take care of my
contract today, but �somehow� you just couldn�t find the time.� Her mouth had
shaped itself into an ugly snarl, or at least as ugly as her beautiful face
could manage. �Like I told you, Howard, the men I know make lots of promises
that they just �don�t get around to,� at least with CELTs. It�s really amazing
how many times it�s happened. You are just a younger version of those same
pricks.� 

Then she paused and continued with real hatred,
�No, I take that back, Howard. Most of them have not been as hypocritical... as
cowardly!�

�Jess, I want you to be quiet now.� I was
steaming and thinking about how this was sounding to the driver. �I told you I
would take care of it, and I will,� I said in forced whisper. �And look, I use
that restaurant all the time. You embarrassed me in there; not only that, it
was totally unnecessary.� I was pissed.

��and by the way, you did order the blueberry.�

She turned a bright red, turned her face away
and stopped talking. I was happy to let things settle down. When we reached the
house, she jumped out and ran to the door, opening it with a key that she could
only have gotten from my desk. Realizing this, I was furious. She had rifled
through my private things! 

This had to stop� right now.

I handed the driver a twenty dollar bill and
waited for my change, mostly to give myself time to calm down. Then I followed
her slowly into the house. The light was on in the library. I was thinking
about my opinions: �throw this crazy bitch out in the morning; �take her to a
hotel; �call my lawyer; �call the cops. This scene was definitely not my style,
and she was definitely too emotional, too erratic, too volatile for my taste. I
was a quiet introverted kind of guy; loud, aggressive people turned me off.

It was sad though, I thought. She was someone I
could have enjoyed being with. Why did she go nuts all of a sudden?

I was prepared for more craziness, but the
scene in front of me when I reached the library door was way beyond crazy.
Jesse was squatting on the rug, naked from the waist down, pissing on the
Oriental rug in front of my desk. Max�s leather bag was nearby. I was
dumbfounded, quick-frozen to the ground. Strangely, my first though was that
the bag had been moved. 

�This is what I think of your promises, you
little coward,� she screamed at me across the room. �You�re just another
fucking liar. And don�t ever tell me to be quiet again; I�ll say what I want.�
She was in an insane rage, but now so was I. This CELT bitch-whore was pissing
on me, on my Grandfather�s rug�

For the first time in my amazingly gentile
life, I literally saw red. Enraged, I crossed the space between us in a second
(tennis players are incredibly fast over short distances) and pushed her hard
to one side. She hit her head on the desk and was momentarily stunned. Seizing
the advantage, I sat on her back and pinned her arms in the small of her back.
She recovered within seconds and started to scream. Not just scream, to buck,
kick, bite�I had a wildcat on my hands.

Desperate to control her, I franticly looked
around the room. The only thing within reach was the bag. I pulled it to me.
Inside, right on top, were the soft leather binding strips. Hadn�t I pushed
them to the bottom when I got her clothes? Whatever� 

She was incredibly strong, but fortunately I
was stronger. (I had been playing tennis since I was five.) In a minute, I had
her wrists tied. Unbelievably, she was still trying to kick me with her bound
feet. Grabbing another strap, I tied her ankles, bent her legs at the knees and
tied her wrists to her ankles. It wasn�t painful, just restraining.

�Let me out of this you fucking coward!� she
screamed. �You�re a weakling and a liar. When I get out of this, I�m going
straight to my lawyer. Your fucking family will never forgive you.�

I was shaken. Now I was part of a legal
dispute. This was scary stuff. Where was the wonderful girl that I had been
with tonight? �the one who had cried on my knee last night in the plane? I
needed her to stop talking, right now. Dumping the bag�s contents on the floor,
I found a huge ball gag and pushed it against her closed mouth. She refused to
open and with a sudden shake of her head, knocked it out of my hand. 

�Don�t start something you can�t finish, Little
Coward� she was almost laughing in her rage. �I�ve been tied by real men, men
with balls. You think you can compete with them?� 

Again I saw red and in an insane moment of my
own, I grabbed her hair and pulled her head back. Then I held roughly shoved in
the gag into her mouth, dropped her head and tightened the gag�s strap behind
her neck. Still in a rage, I spied the leather hood and pulled that over her
head as well, fastening its collar around her neck. 

Emotionally drained and exhausted, I sat back
in a chair to calm myself. Jesse also quieted slowly. What an incredible mess.
Did I really need to tie her up this way? �just �til she calms down, I told
myself. She really could have hurt me, or herself. Maybe she needs psychiatric
help. She must be bipolar or something, an hour ago we had been laughing,
sharing personal experiences even secrets.

When I was sure she had settled down, I walked
over and removed the hood. She looked at me normally, even a little
embarrassed. I took out the gag.

�I�m sorry, Jesse, I thought you were going to
hurt yourself,� I was embarrassed and started to move to untie her wrists.

�Don�t worry about it, Howard,� she said in an
absolutely calm and rationale voice. �People get carried away and abuse their
CELTs all the time. We�ll let our lawyers sort this out. I�ll try to keep it
out of the newspapers.�

I froze. What�s this? Newspapers� My parents
will be devastated. I�ll be fired.

I returned to the chair and sat down, shaken.

�Let me out of this, Howard, or I�ll call the
cops tonight. How good do you think its going to look to have flashing lights
on your street. Every additional second that I stay in this is another��

I jumped up and roughly shoved the ball gag
back into her mouth and replaced the hood. I couldn�t handle any more graphic
detail of exactly how my life was going to be flushed down the toilet.

I returned to my chair and watched her. Was
this really as bad as she implied? I would need to explain what had happened,
but people would understand. It wasn�t as if I went to a CELT auction and
bought myself a contract. My family also had some of the best lawyers in the
country. 

As I calmed myself, I watched her. She
certainly had great legs and a great ass; not only that, but her oversized cunt
was now bare and fully visible �

�Fuck this,� I said out loud still angry and
retrieved a pair of scissors. I paused for a moment watching her ass then I
used the scissors to cut off the rest of her clothing. She struggled violently
and tried to say something through the gag.

Do I really care what she has to say? I
thought. Not really. I was finished with her now, what difference did it make?

I returned to my chair once again. What a
magnificent body! I took my time and examined every inch of it. I also paused
to admire my hurried bondage. Without thinking about it, I had crossed her
ankles and wrists; splaying her knees and elbows to the sides and preventing
her from rolling over. Not a bad job for a novice, I thought. She was completely
restrained. 

Is that all I wanted�to restrain her? Shouldn�t
she pay in some way for her behavior tonight? Isn�t this why CELT contracts
allowed physical discipline? I examined my feelings. The small oriental that
she had pissed on was probably ruined. It had been worth a lot of money. The
scene she had created in the restaurant had embarrassed me in front of a lot of
people, some that I knew. Not only that, but her insults and threats were clear
challenges to my, albeit temporary, authority. Wasn�t I entitled to the respect
due an owner until she was emancipated? Fuck all that, wasn�t I entitled to the
respect due someone who had risked everything to help her, a CELT? 

The more I thought about it, the more incensed
I became. If any CELT ever deserved to be punished, it was her. I really would
be a coward if I let all of this go by without responding in a way that was
expected with a CELT. Was I really the coward she kept calling me?

I spent a few more minutes thinking then I
walked over and hooded her once again. Untying her arms, I brought them over
her head to her shoulder blades and bound her wrists once again. I also tied
her elbows together behind her head. Surprisingly, the hood made her quite
manageable�a lesson learned. Using a long strap from Max�s bag, I looped her
wrists and ankles together again. By lifting her legs while pulling on the end
of the strap, I was able to arch her back until her body was pulled into a
tight bow. I stopped when her knees were fully off the ground and all of her
weight was on her chest. Lastly, I tied a strap to the loop at the top of her
hood and pulled her head back hard tying it off to her elbow strap.

Her body whipsawed violently during this entire
process, but each new tie restrained it a little more until the whipping motion
turned into minor jerking. Hesitantly at first, I ran my hands over her
breasts. They were incredible. Then for some reason, I pinched her nipples. I
could hear her grunting through the hood. I did it again, harder. Her body
jerked violently in protest. I did it again, even harder. I could hear her
protests turning into a cry of real pain. I enjoyed it.

I stood back to admire my work. Her breasts and
ass were rock hard under the strain of the bow; in fact, all of her muscles
were straining to relieve the pressure on her back. Her knees were pointed to
her sides allowing me an unrestricted view of her cunt which I noticed was
dripping wet. What did that mean? I wondered. 

I returned to my chair to watch her. There was
something mesmerizing in her jerking motions, in the muffled groans coming from
inside the hood; it was hypnotic, like watching the flames in a fireplace. In
fact, why shouldn�t I have a fire for this? I got up and lit the simulated-wood
fire, lowering the lights until the flames cast her bare, glistening skin in a
romantic glow.

I was absolutely calm now and surprisingly
happy with myself. Her muffled cries had become part of the room�s ambiance,
contrasting nicely with its soft leathers and dark wood. I had a vision of
Jesse as a party decoration, naked, hooded, and hogtied on the stone table,
writhing in the fire�s glow as people stood around talking with their drinks
in-hand.

I got up and removed the hood; I wanted to see
her eyes.

Without the hood and its built-in loop, though,
I needed to tie a strap around her forehead to keep her head up, which I did.
She tried to say something while this was going on, but the leather gag made
her grunts incomprehensible. No matter, I could tell from the mix of pain and
rage in her eyes that she wasn�t happy. 

In fact, it was even better for me that she was
still acting like a wildcat. I wasn�t totally sure that I could handle it if
she were to become normal again, to plead with me. Reaching into the bag, I
found the Piranhas and held them in front of her face. For a flickering second,
her rage was replaced by fear. Good, she was finally beginning to understand
that she had gone too far with me. Pushing her back by the shoulders, I grabbed
each breast and slipped the Piranhas on as far as they would go. A high pitched
groan came from her throat as they bit into her nipples. Then I slowly lowered
her to the floor until her full weight was back on her chest. Now, every time
she moved the Piranhas pushed against the hardwood floor and took a new bite.
She tried to arch her back higher to take the weight off, but it was
impossible. Slowly, she resigned herself to their gnawing pain. 

I starred into her eyes. I could see that the
pain in her nipples was gradually being overshadowed by that in her arched back
and shoulders. I realized that each new pain had its own its own unique time
and personality�more useful information.

I watched her suffer like this for almost five
minutes. Gradually, the rage in her eyes was replaced by an unmistakable plea for
mercy. This was the same look she had given me in the lounge. I ignored her for
another full minute. Finally, I reached over and released the strap that held
her in the hogtie. Her body went flat and motionless on the floor. She groaned
as her over-stressed muscles relaxed; I removed her gag.

She lay exhausted on her stomach. Her wrists
and crossed ankles were still bound and the Piranhas were still attached. I
examined her hands and feet carefully to be sure that there was no loss of
circulation and spoke to her in a voice devoid of all emotion. 

�Are you ready to talk to me normally now?� I
asked. I�m not sure what I expected, but it wasn�t the voice dripping with
venom that said, �Fuck you, Howard the Coward. I�ll bet you enjoyed every
minute of that.�

I was surprised and it showed in my face. She
took my surprise as a minor victory and smiled. But every victory has its
price. Without hesitation, I reinserted the gag and put her back into the arch
for another five minutes. Her suffering this second time was even more
excruciating.

When I released the gag, she cried
hysterically, unable to catch her breath. As before, her wrists and ankles were
still tied and the Piranhas were still in place. I wanted her to believe that I
was ready to do it again. I watched her with mixed emotions�on one hand she
deserved it, in spades; on the other, did anyone have the right to cause this
much pain in another human being� for any reason? I didn�t know the answer; all
I knew was that I needed to come out of this contest a clear winner, for both
our sakes. 

When the crying subsided I said, �I can keep
this up all night, Jess, how about you?� There was real fear in her eyes now. 

�Listen to me. I fully intend to emancipate you
as soon as I can. But until that happens, I need you to act like a human being.
I can�t have you making scenes, or threatening me with lawyers, or newspapers,
or stealing my keys, or pissing on my Grandfather�s oriental rugs. It seems to
me that the only way I can prevent those things is to temporarily exert my
legal rights over you as your contract owner, and for you to act like the CELT
that you are.� 

I paused; there was no answer from her. I was
frustrated. Did she really want me to do it again? Then I realized my mistake.
CELTs speak only when invited, typically in response to a direct question.

�Do you agree to act like my contract-girl
until I emancipate you?� I asked.

�Yes, Master,� she said respectfully. This time
I didn�t correct her. I really was her master, at least for a while. It would
be better if we both remembered that. 

Gently, I removed the Piranhas and untied her.
Then I lowered her arms and retied them behind her back. I wanted to be sure
that she was herself. She didn�t move or make a sound. After a while, I helped
her to her knees. Then I sat back down in my chair. She was naked with her
hands tied, sitting back on her haunches in the firelight. She was incredibly
beautiful. Slowly, she raised her head and looked at me. Her mouth was partly
open and I could see her tongue moving between her teeth. She was breathing
heavily. Her pointed nipples looked amazing. 

�You owe me a kiss, Howard,� she said softly.

It took me a moment to understand. Then I
remembered her challenge at dinner to turn me into a Sadist within an hour. Was
that only an hour ago?

�Look, Jesse, we need to talk about�� I started
to say.

She interrupted me, �No more talk, Howard. My
kiss�� 

I stood up and walked over to her. Then I
reached under her arms and lifted her to her feet. We looked at each other and
then kissed eagerly as I ran my hands over her naked, bound body.

At some point, she dropped to her knees and
started to nuzzle my crouch. I stepped out of my clothes. She moved to me on
her knees and turned her head sideways, gently sucking my balls into her mouth.
I could feel her teeth and mouth pressing softly as her throat made a low
purring sound. I was ready to come, but I held back, knowing that this was not
the right moment.

After a time, she took my cock into her mouth.
As I had imagined, she was accomplished and used her lips and tongue to massage
and stimulate every part of the organ. She had also been trained to suppress
her natural gag reflex, allowing me to push my cock deeply into her throat. It
was necessary pull back occasionally to give her time to breathe, but
eventually we found the right rhythm and soon it seemed as natural as fucking
her pussy. 

At exactly the right moment her eyes lifted and
I knew that, for the moment at least, she was subjugated. It was an incredible
moment of insight. She was fulfilled, helpless, on her knees, sucking my cock.
This was not a conscious or voluntary act; it was the result of 50,000 years of
human evolution.

I felt an incredible rush of strength and power
and grabbed her hair in both hands as I came in her mouth; every muscle in my
body was straining. She didn�t choke or struggle to pull away. Just the
opposite, her body began undulated as she hungrily swallowed my cum. Then, as a
conclusion to our �mating� she sucked me dry.

I kept her hands tied and carried her to her
room, laying her gently on the bed. She wasn�t asleep, but she wasn�t fully
conscious either. It was a kind of stupor, almost as if she were drugged. That
night, I kept her tied and fucked her until my balls turned blue. Then I freed
her and went to my room.

The next morning, I left early again, before
she was awake. I left her all the cash I had in the house, about $1,500, and a
very different kind of note:

Jesse,

I�m not sure
exactly what happened last night, but it was incredibly wonderful. I would love
to have you as my CELT, whatever the consequences. However, I also want you to
stay of your own accord. Consequently, I reaffirm my promise to emancipate you
with no financial penalty if you so choose.

We can talk
about it when I get home.

The money enclosed
is a gift for clothes and other essentials you may need.

Sincerely,

Howard Lowe

VI



The library in
my grandfather�s house was massive, about 30 feet long and 15 feet wide with an
18-foot-tall peaked ceiling. Crisscrossed beams ran the full length of it
ceiling, creating openings which looked like the night sky when the lighting
was right. A beautiful dark oak had been used to finish all surfaces and to
trim the fireplace, which was made of rough-cut black granite. A
large parlor and a dining room further isolated the library from the street. It
was totally soundproof as my Grandfather had intended.

Despite its size, the room was surprisingly
cozy. This was achieved by creating three distinct zones. At one end there was
an oversized cherry-wood desk; at the other was a long reading table made of
the same light cherry. In the middle, in front of the fireplace was the most
unusual piece in the house�a huge, stone coffee table made of the same
rough-hewn black granite as the fireplace. The table�s stone surface seemed to
absorb light, creating an inky black hole in the floor. Its enormous weight was
supported by a number of steel beams which rose up out of a concrete platform
in the basement.

I arrived home that third evening with mixed
emotions. What had been inconceivable 24 hours ago was now an undeniable
truth�I was capable of sadism. More importantly, as Jesse had predicted, I�d
enjoyed it! 

This had been on my mind all day. 

I knew now that her threat to bring in a lawyer
was hollow. It had just been another part of her game, one designed to feed on
my insecurity. I was beginning to realize that Jesse was an expert at finding
and pushing the right buttons.

She had, in fact, scripted the entire evening,
including her punishment. It was amazing how easily I had been manipulated. I
was resolved that tonight would be different. I�d be a perfect gentleman and
I�d force her to be a perfect lady, assuming of course she had decided to stay.
I was sure that we could work out a more normal relationship, something that
made sense for both of us. I had even prepared a little speech of apology. I
still didn�t want people to know that I now owned a CELT, but I was no longer
prepared to give her up just for that reason. 

She was waiting for me in the library. After
last night�s pissing scene, I was sure that nothing she could do would ever
surprise me again. I was wrong.

She was kneeling on the stone table naked
except for a hood and a collar. The collar, which was tied to an overhead
beams, kept her upper body ramrod straight. A wooden platform of some kind held
her feet and legs motionless. The light-absorbing surface of the table made it
appear that she was floating.

A mean-looking riding crop and two leather
mittens lay neatly on the edge of the table beside her. Three complete dinner
outfits had been arranged on the nearby easy chairs. The fourth chair, the one
closest to her was empty. 

I was struck dumb and walked around the table
in a trance. I sat down to think and, I admit, to study her amazing bondage. 

The kneeler resting on the table was an antique
made of light oak. Surprisingly, it fit quite well with the room�s d�cor. (Had
she gone out and bought this thing, I wondered?) It was 2-inches thick, about
three feet long and two feet wide. Her upturned feet lay absolutely flat about
12 inches apart inside two beautifully carved indentations. A second wooden
block, with holes in the shape of a woman�s heel, held the back of her feet.
This block was hinged to the base like a stock. I could see that the foot
indentations in the surface were designed to hold the girl�s feet in place
while the block was being closed; this would be important, I thought, if she
was struggling. A thin leather strap at the front of each foot completed the
binding. It prevented the foot from moving laterally or curling up, but still
allowed it to arch beautifully. 

At the other end of the base was a thick
leather kneeling pad. Straps buckled just behind the knees, forcing them deep
into the leather and keeping her legs about 20 inches apart at that point. It
was clear that the purpose of spreading her knees this far was to expose the
full length of her inner thigh and her cunt to the whip. I imagined that the
girl�s terror was greatly increased by having her vagina open and exposed.

This was a working bastinado�a torture device
popular for centuries to exert control, especially over mistresses or sexually
repressed young wives. After a night of unsatisfactory sex, for example, a
gentleman would sometimes have his lady dress properly and then lock her in the
bastinado. When he returned in the evening, he would cane the soles of her feet
to motivate better performance. During the day, the bound victim could continue
to supervise the affairs of the household, and even receive her consoling
friends. If a harsh caning left her unable to walk that evening, all the
better; her first place was in bed anyway. 

Unlike the relatively thick sack-like hood of
the other night, tonight Jesse wore a black-leather hood that hugged every
curve of her beautiful face. It had two small holes for breathing through the
nose, and a large hole for her mouth. The black ball-gag from Max�s bag was
strapped deeply inside her mouth; it made her incredible lips appear even
larger.

Stretching her thin neck to its limit was a
6-inch leather collar. It had a cruel blunt point at the top which pushed
against the underside of her mouth, forcing her head high and back. Six tiny
belts in the front were used to tighten the device and there was 4-inch metal
D-ring in the back that allowed the collar to be used as a general-purpose
attachment point.

The rope that hung from the ceiling beam was no
ordinary clothesline. It was a black, non-stretch climber�s rope. (She must
have bought this as well.) It had been tied to the top of the neck-collar�s
metal D-ring, run over the overhead beam, and then tied off to the D-ring with
a non-slip climbers knot. It was obvious from her ramrod straight back that her
upper body had been pulled taunt by the rope before it was tied off. Jesse
obviously liked her bondage tight. 

Each of her wrists was also secured to the
collar with a double-sided snap hook. This was done by self-bending each arm
back to the shoulder blade and then snapping the hook onto the collar�s D-ring.
That must have been an incredibly painful maneuver, I thought.

Obviously, she had put herself in this
position. What did it mean? Was this her way of communicating her decision to
stay� to reaffirm her status as my CELT?�
I thought about this for several minutes. Maybe, but there was something
else; she also wanted to test me, make sure that last night was no fluke. I was
sure of it; she wanted to see how I would respond when there was no anger or
emotion involved. I was instantly glad that my apology remained my secret; this
girl had no time for weak men.

But how was I going to respond? Was I strong
enough? What if I didn�t measure up? What if I looked like a weakling? For a
minute, the insecurity and fear were overwhelming; then I felt another emotion,
an even stronger one�anger. Who was she to be testing me!

I retrieved the mittens, stepped onto the table
and moved behind her with my legs astride the bastinado, Gently, I closed her
hands into fists and strapped on the leather mittens. I could feel her body
trembling through her fingers. Did I have the strength to hurt her? My anger
disappeared instantly and I felt my resolve eroding. She was incredibly
beautiful; could I really whip her�in cold blood?

My hands were shaking as I moved to her front
and tightened the six straps on her collar, forcing her head up even higher.
This also made her back straighter, putting some slack into the ceiling rope. I
tightened the rope until it was like a guitar string.� 

Her body now formed a perfect �L�. She could
move her hips and flat belly a few inches in either direction, but that was it,
otherwise it was as if she was set in cement. She was also absolutely silent. I
stepped down from the table and sat back in the chair. Cruelly, I considered
adding the Piranhas. No, I thought, I didn�t want her distracted. For the next
half-hour or so I wanted her mind totally focused on the crop�and on me.

I retrieved the clothes she had laid out and
held each one up to her front. She bristled as the material brushed her bare
skin. I selected a white silk shirt with a plunging neckline and a gray skirt.
She had included some underwear which I set aside; tonight, I wanted her naked
underneath. For shoes, I selected a pair of ultra-sexy ankle-strap heels.

Holding the shirt against her body, I made tiny
dots on her skin with a felt-tipped pen. I did the same with the skirt. These
marked the areas covered by the clothes I�d selected. I�m sure she knew what
was happening. It must feel strange, I thought, to know you were being prepared
for pain.�� 

Taking a deep breath, I retrieved the long crop
and made a few test swings. Her cunt turned dark red in anticipation. I had
never whipped a woman, but the crop felt natural in my hand as I moved into a
comfortable whipping position. 

I struck her ass. There was a satisfying
�thwack� and her body jerked, but no sound.�
I struck her a second time, harder, and then a third until I heard a
muffled yelp. This was the right level of force. I started again.

Each stroke produced a red mark which made an
ideal guide as I moved down her legs in neat columns. She was glistening with
sweat when I finished her back. Without hesitating, I started on her inner
thighs. This was serious pain and immediately her almost-playful yelps and
jerks changed into short painful screams and mini-convulsions. I watched these
closely to gauge the force needed for maximum pain. After a while, the swish of
the crop, the satisfying �thwack,� and her muffled screams all blended into a
kind of savage rhythm.

When I finished her thighs, I moved to the front
and paused. She was moaning pitifully. I thought about removing her gag, but
decided to wait. I cropped her underarms then worked my way down her torso,
taking care to avoid her breast and pussy and always staying within the tiny
black dots. When I was finished I stood back and watched her again. Her body
moved in a dance of intense pain, as if it were engulfed in flame.

I removed the gag and stood back. She
immediately started panting like a dog in heat, too overwhelmed even to scream.
I almost stopped; then I remembered that she was testing me. What would she
think if I ended her torment too early? I stood back and viciously cropped her
breasts, leaving her nipples to the end. Her head twisted violently and she
wailed in agony with each new stroke. I heard her try to say �please� a number
of times, but she never quite got the word out. I replaced her gag, amazed at
my growing callousness. 

Then I whipped her pussy. In the middle of
this, I could see her mind starting to go numb in self-defense.

No way, I thought; I wanted her to feel every
stroke. I sat down and relaxed, giving her time to recover. When she calmed, I
moved in close to her feet and gave the sole of each foot five test strokes.
The bastinado worked perfectly to hold her feet absolutely still. I knew
somehow that this was the only pain that would now penetrate to her brain.
There was no sound anymore and the only real movement was the puckering and
un-puckering of her ass cheeks. I used this to gauge the pain and the timing of
each stroke, knowing that she would only feel new strokes now when the pain
subsided. As I waited, I watched the mittens puff out as her fingers moved in
an impossible attempt to reach through the leather to the snap hooks.� 

I wanted her to walk tonight and cropped her feet
to that limit, which somehow I knew. I dropped my pants, stepped up on the
table, and removed her gag. Without waiting, I grabbed the back of her hooded
head and pushed my penis into her mouth. Her mind had shut down for sex and
there was almost no response.

Reaching over her back, I began to savagely
crop her ass and thighs. This new cropping on top of the old shocked her out of
her stupor. Almost immediately she understood the relationship between her new
pain and the cock in her mouth and she started to franticly suck me off. This
was the desperate act of an animal in pain with none of the cocksucking form of
the prior evening, but it did the job. I ejaculated within seconds, but she was
in such distress that she let my cock fly out, causing several spurts to drop
to the polished wooden floor.

I adjusted my pants and returned to my chair.
The girl was covered with painful welts that must have felt like the fires of
hell. Curious, I watched her twitch for a full ten minutes. Then I walked over
and ran my hands over her body. At first she pulled away afraid, but gradually
she began to respond, pushing herself against my moving palm. Incredibly, she
wanted to be fucked again.

But I had other plans for the evening.
Carefully, I released her from all the bondage and laid her down on the black
table next to the bastinado. I returned to the chair. After a few more minutes
rest, she began to stir. I spoke for the first time.

�Take this outfit, Jesse, and go shower. We�re
going to dinner. You have one hour. If you�re not back here by then, we�ll
repeat the cropping.� I knew this was the appropriate tone. I waited. In a few
seconds, she moved to sit on the table�s edge.

�You also made a terrible mess on the floor,� I
said. �Clean it up.� She looked at me and hesitated. I jumped up, pushed her
flat on the table, and gave her ten sharp whacks on the ass; she didn�t resist
and immediately after slid to the floor and began to clean it with her tongue.
In five minutes, she had polished it to its original sheen. �That�s enough,� I
said; �go get ready. You now have fifty-five minutes.� 

She tried to get to her feet, but it was too
painful. She tried again and again, but was unable to put any weight on them.
Every muscle in my body wanted to move to her aid, but I remained seated,
watching. Finally, she put the clothes and shoes in her mouth and walked out of
the room on her hands and knees, her naked body moving like a cat.

Once she was out of the room, a wave of shame
washed over me. What had I done? She had wanted it, but did that make it right?
Did anything give me the right to treat her this way? Fuck it. This was no time
for moral confusion, for weakness. I was convinced that she was testing my
mettle, and there was no way I was going to come up short again.






VII



Jesse returned to the library with five minutes
to spare, walking painfully but steadily to the door in her high heels. She
looked stunningly, with an amazing glow that I had never seen on a woman. Was
it the whipping, I wondered?

Her hair had been put up into a single long
braid, exposing her long neck. I should have realized that it needed to be
washed and dried after wearing the hood. The braid was her way of hiding my
error. There were also marks on her throat that she had tried to cover with
makeup. Anyone who knew bondage would know immediately that they had been
caused by a too-tight collar, but the makeup would fool most others. Anyway,
there was nothing to be done about it now. Another lesson learned: don�t make
the ties too tight if you want to go out afterwards. 

I looked down at her legs which seemed to go on
forever in the heels. Thankfully, they showed no marks. Her feet, however, were
beat red.

I took a breath and once again promised myself
not to weaken. I must talk and act as if I were a real CELT owner, not just a
lucky kid. �Walk down this hallway and back,� I ordered. She obeyed
immediately. Each step seemed painful, but it she was steady and not in any
real danger of falling. Perfect, I thought, just enough pain to remind her that
I could be harsh as well as kind.

I took her arm and led her to the front door
where I helped with her coat. Then I held out my arm and she took it without
hesitation.

�Outside this doorway, you will speak and act
like my girlfriend. Inside, you will do nothing without my permission. Is that
clear?� She smiled contentedly and nodded her head in understanding. I waited
for the proper response, knowing that she was still testing me.

�Yes, Master, I understand,� she replied
politely after a few seconds. I nodded and carefully walked us outside to the
waiting cab.

After giving instructions to the driver I
turned to her and asked, �Where did you get the clothes?�

�Two different shops on Fifth, Mas�,� she
stopped and looked at me with a small smile, �Howard.� I smiled in return. I
was amazed at her recuperative ability; an hour ago she was incoherent with
pain.

��and the bastinado?� I whispered.

�From a dealer I know in the village,� she
replied, surprised that I knew its name.

�That�s an excellent piece,� I said. �You�ll
have to give me his name. I may want to buy others from him.�

�I will,� she said. �I�m happy that you were
pleased. It�s actually somewhat rare, 18th Century he said.�

�Yes, the bastinado was popular at that time in
Eastern Europe and the Middle East. Did you know that it was primarily used in the home to
train sexually repressed young girls?� I was speaking too softly for the driver
to hear. She shook her head no and looked at me directly for the first time.

�Sometimes men wanted more from their women.
Girls in those days were often too shy to even raise their nightgowns,� I
explained. �Proper young ladies of the day, even mistresses, were programmed to
resist as long as they could. They were actually a lot more comfortable being
forced to submit, especially for �despicable acts.� You could say that the
bastinado was making things easier for everyone. Judging from the stains, I�d
say the one you bought has been in steady use since it was built.�

�Stains?� she was openly curious.

�Yes, the dark area where the feet are tied;
I�m sure that they are blood mixed with sweat. In the old days they used a cane
and they weren�t too worried about drawing a little blood. Probably hundreds of
girls have bled on that wood.� I could see that she was listening intently.

�It took a long time for women to get some
rights,� she said softly.

�Yes it did,� I replied sarcastically, �then as
soon the CELT laws went into effect, thousands of them sold those rights off to
the highest bidder.� I could see that she wanted to respond, but held it back.
I stayed quiet as well. The last thing we needed tonight was a political
debate. 

�Did you spend all the money?� I asked
casually.

She looked at me. I could see that she was
trying to think of a �right� answer. Finally, she just said, �Yes,� and looked
down guiltily. In a few seconds she added, ��and more. The owner of the shop
said I could pay him the rest later.�

I looked at her and nodded, �That�s okay. Let
me have his name, I�ll send him a check for what we owe. Please don�t spend my
money again until you ask.� She looked at me and nodded, relieved.

In truth, this was not acceptable behavior for
a CELT. Most owners would have severely punished such irresponsible buying
behavior, but I let it drop. There were things I need to learn before exerting
real authority here. There was also a more serious issue in her hesitation.

I looked at her with a hard expression, �Don�t
ever think about hiding something like that from me again, OK?�

She nodded again and smiled. Then, impulsively,
she grabbed my hand and held it against her silk-clad chest. I could feel her
hard breast and nipple on the back of my hand. Clearly, I had passed another
test. We didn�t speak for the rest of the short ride.

I had selected a quiet Italian restaurant on
the lower east side. I knew they had great food and secluded corner booths for
couples�lovers. I asked for one of these. Once seated, I took her through the
menu in detail, explaining the special way in which many of the dishes were
prepared. I had been here many times, mostly with friends and business
colleagues.

�I�m not that hungry, Howard,� she said. �In
fact, I�m pretty full.� She looked at me playfully and grinned, licking her
lips. I laughed, knowing exactly what she meant. That broke the ice, and we
started talking again like friends; it was a repeat of the prior evening. I
marveled again at how quickly she had recovered from the cropping.

She steered most of our conversation back to
life in the 18th Century, specifically how men treated their women.
I was no expert, but I knew a lot and she seemed happy with the information. I
was also happy�she was intellectually curious. That was important to me. I
wanted to be with someone smart; stupid girls, even if they were gorgeous,
turned me off. 

Once the meal was served, I broached the
delicate subject of our relationship� �What was that about tonight, Jess?� I
asked.

She didn�t try to deflect the question, but her
smile faded and she starred at her plate. �You told me to act like a CELT,
Howard. That�s what I was doing.� The open friendliness was gone; she was back
in role. I had a flashback to the way she had spoken about Max. It was the same
tone. 

�That�s not good enough, Jess,� I replied. �I�m
not interested in having a CELT whore or a B&amp;D freak on my hands; I want us
to have a relationship, at least until we get you emancipated, if that�s what
you want.� She looked at me with a strange expression and nodded mechanically,
but didn�t say anything.

I have to admit that I was hurt by her silence
and it showed. �Let me ask you a question,� I said. �Do you feel anything for
me?�

�Look, Howard,� she said more warmly, �why
can�t we just let it rest. I�m here as your CELT. We both know that that
involves sex. I�m not a whore; I�m only with one man at a time. And I�m not
sure about emancipation, but until we work that out I�ll abide by the terms of
my contract. There�s no rush, is there? I love the time we�ve spent together�on
both sides of your doorway. And no, I�m not an insane B&amp;D freak; I hate
pain just like any normal person. In fact, I�m terrified of what is in store
for me with you, but I�m a CELT and I�ve agreed to this�this arrangement. Can�t
we just let things stay as they are for a while?� She reached out for my hand
and squeezed it. 

Her touch seemed mechanical as if this was the
right thing for an escort to do at this moment. For some reason, this enraged
me. �No,� I hissed, �I don�t accept your explanation or this situation.� She
continued to hold my gaze, but withdrew her hand. �I know part of this has been
a game. You�re not the kind of person who throws a fit and smears a waiter with
pie.� She lowered her eyes and blushed. �You�re also not the kind of person who
pisses on a rug when you�re angry.� Her blush got even redder.

We were both quiet for a minute. Then she
leaned back and started talking in a totally different voice, her real voice.
�OK, Howard, you want the truth so badly, here it is. Yes, I did manipulate
things. That�s what powerless CELTs do�we manipulate things. You helped me with
Max and I wanted to repay the favor. I knew that you were too nice a guy to do
it on your own so I helped you out a bit to get us started. We both know that
you did great. But the hard truth is that it was just part of the game. How
could it be anything more? We�ve only known each other for three days.� 

She stopped for a minute leaned back in and
again took my hand in hers.

�I like you, Howard� a lot, but were not in
love,� she continued. �Good men like you fall in love with their CELTs all the
time.� Her voice dropped to a whisper, �It�s understandable, I�ve sucked your
cock for heaven�s sake. You�ve come in my mouth and fucked me �til I was sore.
Tonight, you whipped me�as hard as I�ve ever been whipped before. Those are
intimate acts, Howard, they make people think strange thoughts, but in truth
they are just part of our game, and frankly part of our business relationship.
We can both get badly hurt by thinking that they are something more.� She
paused and looked around to be sure that she was not being overheard.

�This is what most CELT arrangements are like.
They are not about real love or subjugation or dominance. They are fantasies. A
power-relationship, a real one, is dangerous. There are so many emotions and
feelings involved�pain, fear, love, hate, sex, desire, jealousy�that it takes
someone with real experience to pull it off, someone with a stone heart.�

Then mercilessly she delivered the coup de
gr�ce, �You still want to emancipate me, dear Howard� how hard is your heart?�

I was devastated. Despite the craziness of the
last three days, I thought we actually had developed some kind of closeness for
each other. I knew it wasn�t love, but maybe it was� well I don�t know what it
was. I only knew that I felt something and I didn�t want it to end. I also
didn�t want us to mutate into a man and his beautiful CELT whore. 

But what she said about the reality of our
situation had the ring of truth, and that hurt. �I need to think about this,
Jess� I said honestly. �Let�s go home.�

We rode home in silence then I walked her to
her bedroom.

�Maybe we could sleep together tonight,
Howard?� she asked in her little girl voice, obviously upset over the night�s
turn of events. �That was nice last night and I really don�t want to be alone
now.�

�Tomorrow, Jesse,� I answered. Then I kissed
her gently on the cheek and walked off to my own room feeling a little like
Humphrey Bogart in Casablanca. She stood in her doorway until my door closed then I
heard hers shut softly. It was all too sad.

I didn�t sleep much that night or the next
four. Each morning, I left early and returned very late, working hard to avoid
any real contact. A number of times she tried to initiate conversation, but it
was obvious that I was sulking and after a while she just stayed away. The
sixth night I made preparations and on the seventh day I called the bank to say
I was sick with the flu. 






VIII



I was waiting for her when she opened her
bedroom door. She was barefooted, dressed in jeans and a sweatshirt. Her hair
was wet and she had a wonderful, just-showered smell.

�Howard, I�� she started when she saw me
waiting.

�Strip,� I said.

�Howard, I think�� she tried again.

�STRIP,� I said in a voice that would have made
a marine drill instructor proud.

She looked at me for a second and pressed her
lips together hard, then she obediently pealed off her sweater and stepped out
of her jeans. She was wearing the black leather thong that she had worn in the
airport. �Leave that,� I said as she started to remove it. �Turn around and put
your hands behind your back.� I was surprised at how steady my voice was.

She turned around and placed her hands in the
small of her back. I quickly cuffed her wrists with leather shackles and pulled
the loose leather hood over her head. I buckled the hood behind her neck as I
had seen Max do. She stood there naked and tall�an obedient CELT�no sound, no
movement, no false modesty. I took her arm and led her down the steps, past the
library, and down more steps to the cellar. There was a faint hesitation in her
body when we started down the rough cellar steps, but no resistance. 

In front of us was
the house�s safe-room�a concrete chamber about twelve feet square. It had been
used during the food riots of the 2080s. Except to make this morning�s
modifications, no one had been in this room for years. I led her through the
doorway and stood her in the room�s exact center. There was total and absolute
silence. It was a tomb and even the invisible sounds of everyday life didn�t
penetrate these walls.

Leaving her hood in place, I moved her wrists
to her front and tied them to the climber�s rope that was hanging from the
ceiling. It ran through the eye hook that I had installed last night. I pulled
her arms up until her hands were just above her head. Then I attached leather
ankle cuffs to her feet and snapped them on to a short chain which I had bolted
to the floor. 

I removed her hood and sat down in the corner.
She looked around the room, giving her eyes time to adjust to the light. The
track-mounted spotlights in the ceiling were all centered on her naked form. I
could tell that there was something different in her behavior. For the first
time since we�d been together, she was not controlling events; somehow she
seemed more relaxed because of it.

�It�s called a safe-room,� I said from the dark
corner. �It has one foot of reinforced concrete all around with a 4-inch-thick
steel-core door. There�s a small bathroom in the back. It was built during the
food riots for protection against home invasion. In case you�re interested,
these walls also support the fireplace and the stone table you like in the
library.� 

She looked around the empty concrete room, but
didn�t say anything. �It�s completely soundproof, of course,� I continued,
�like the library. I guess my Grandfather really liked his privacy.�

She remained silent, waiting.

�I decided that you were right last night,
Jess. Everything that�s happened in the last few days has been basically a
game. You played a little; I played a little; we had some fun, but it�s
certainly not the basis of a relationship�of any kind.� She was looking in the
direction of my voice now, shifting her weight from one foot to
another�unconcerned. �It did however give me a taste for the power you
mentioned. I�ve decided to explore that a little.�

�Howard, can I say something?� It was the tone
of a wise friend about to give advice. It was rather annoying.

�No. You can�t speak right now, Jess, but I�ll
give you some time in a few minutes,� I was trying to sound equally reasonable
and mature. �In fact, let�s start with the rules for this room. You may not
speak in here except in response to a direct question. That applies to the rest
of the house as well, but every word you say in this room will cost you one
stroke of the whip. Please don�t test me on this; I�d hate to lose a day of my
program whipping you for a speaking violation. Second, in this room you may not
ask for permission to speak. You will be permitted to do that respectfully in
the rest of the house, but not here. Third, just for your information, this
room is only for discipline, we will never have sex in here.�

She was looking a little bored, but I suspected
this was more CELT psycho-manipulation. I waited a few minutes before
continuing. I needed to learn her tricks if I was to really master her. 

�I�ve also decided that you were right about my
lack of resolve. I knew exactly what I wanted from the moment I laid eyes on
you; I just couldn�t admit it even to myself.� She looked even more bored; now
I was sure that this was manipulation. It�s rather good, I thought, designed to
evoke anger and poor judgment.� 

I ignored the subtle provocation and continued,
�I want you, Jess. I�m not totally sure what that means right now, but I know
that I don�t want to free you. I never really wanted to do that; I just thought
it was the right thing, something that I was expected to do. I also have no
intention of selling you�your contract that is, and I certainly have no
intention of allowing you to run my life.�

I stopped and waited. �But this conversation is
for later; right now all you need to know is that I am exercising my legal
right under our contract to use corporal punishment to correct your behavior,
behavior that I consider unacceptable. As per the contract and the laws
governing CELT arrangements, there will be no lasting affects, physical or mental,
from this discipline. I�ve written this down and mailed it to my lawyer along
with a copy of our contract. You have the right to notify your lawyer
independently if you want.�

�Do you understand this right?� I asked. She
looked amused and nodded, yes. �Do you want to call your lawyer?� She nodded,
no. Despite my new understanding that this was all part of her act, I was
getting annoyed with the smartass smirk on her face.

This legal formula was just a formality, but it
was necessary before any serious long-term disciplinary action could take
place. My lawyer would send a notice to hers, or at least the lawyer identified
in her contract, who was supposed to file a watch-notice with the police. It
was intended to prevent abuse, but it was never enforced. It just made me feel
a little better to be complying with the law.

�Do you want to say anything for the record
before we start?� I asked.

�Howard, our contract doesn�t require me to
fuck you and it certainly does not require me to love you; we both know that�s
what you want.� She was wrong, I thought; last night�s discussion had shown me
that love was much too ambiguous. Right now all I wanted was respect.

But all I said was, �Should I write that down?�
She shook her head no, still wearing that maddeningly condescending smile.

I was now convinced that she was putting on an
act. In fact, it occurred to me that her attitude was getting tougher as she
become more frightened. I almost lost my nerve with that realization. 

Instead, I tried to explain, �Despite my
ineptitude over the last few days, Jess, most of what I did was driven by an
honest desire to show you kindness, even friendship. You basically dismissed
that as weakness and manipulated me into becoming your partner in a
sex-and-bondage game. I admit that I was a willing participant, but I deserved
more; I deserved some genuine emotion from you.�

Her smirk disappeared. �Since you place so
little value on what I did, I�ve decided to carry out the punishment Max had
set for you, which I�m sure you remember.�

Her eyes widened and she for a second I could
see that I was right�she was terrified, but disciplined enough to remain
silent. I remembered her words from the other night, ��powerless CELTs
manipulate things.�

�You may speak now if you want,� I said.

�It won�t work, Howard,� she said calmly in the
grown-up voice that I had come to recognize as the real Jesse. The mask was
back; she was desperately hiding her fear. �You don�t have it in you, and when
you discover the truth of that, you�re going to be scarred for life.� She was
using her most convincing and persuasive tone.

�You call it a game,� she said, �but it felt
good to me and I know it felt good to you. Let�s just start with that. I don�t
care about being emancipated. I never wanted anything from you that I didn�t
deserve. I still don�t. Take me upstairs, whip me then fuck my brains out. I
know you like it that way; it�s your right. A lot of things can happen in a
year.� She stopped; there were no tears in her eyes and no fear in her face,
but in the harsh light I could see her breathing hard.

I got up and stood in front of her naked body.
�You�re wrong, Jess,� I replied gently. �A whore is just a whore, no matter how
beautiful or smart. Believe me I know a lot of them. Most of my friends are
married to whores. You�re better than that. I know it and I�m going to prove
it.�

She looked at me with pity.

�Anything else,� I asked. Defiantly, she nodded
her head no. I knew she wanted to beg me not to hurt her, but was too proud. I
admired that. I walked over to the rope and lifted her arms until she was on
her toes. Then I stood in front of her again, we were eye to eye.

�I feel sorry for you, Howard,� she said, still
hiding her fear. I recognized the sincerity in her comment and wondered again
if I could actually pull this off.

�That�s five extra strokes,� I replied. She
just looked at me. I stepped back into the shadows.

Max�s electric whip was a single-tail horror
with copper wire woven through the braid. That morning I whipped her for half
and hour strokes with the setting on #1, the lowest. It was as if she were
being shocked with a cattle prod and touched with a red-hot iron at the same
time. She screamed and thrashed wildly after each stroke, but I was patient,
waiting until she was fully recovered and calm before delivering the next. Near
the end, she was fading in and out of consciousness. To be sure that she felt
the last few strokes, I wet her down and brushed her skin with the whip. The
shock of it revived her enough to allow me to finish. When it was over, I
lowered her arms about a foot and gave her some water through a straw. 

I waited ten minutes for her to rest then I
collared her and attached a four-foot chain which I attached at her feet. The
chain forced her to bend at the knee with her arms extended overhead. The only
way to give her straining leg muscles some relief was to either bend at the
waist, which caused a terrible back pain, or to hang by her wrists. I wanted
her to spend the day shifting from one agony to another. I also wanted to strengthen
her muscles especially in her legs; she would need them later.

Without a word, I turned off all the lights but
one and left, locking the door behind. 

That evening, I returned. She was crying softly
from the pain of her crucifixion. From the peephole, I knew that her back and
legs had given out two hours earlier and that she had been hanging by her arms
since then, pushing up periodically with her trembling legs to keep from
strangling. (An arms-high crucifixion usually kills by slow strangulation as
the victim�s chest muscles weaken to the point where they can no longer take
sufficient air into their lungs.) 

She looked at me and started to cry in relief;
all she could think about now was the pain. I was her salvation. I unhooked the
chain from her neck collar and watched as she tried to stand straight. She
didn�t have enough strength left in her legs. After a minute, I lowered her to
the ground and fed her water, a baloney sandwich, and two protein bars.

She ate slowly, mechanically. I locked her wrists
behind her back and hooked her collar to the short chain in the floor. Her face
was lying in the wet spot where she had peed during the day. I closed the
lights and left.

The next morning I returned at the same time,
increased the whip�s setting to #2 and whipped her for another half-an-hour.
Afterwards, I shortened the neck chain by one link and put her back in
position. I knew that her tolerances would increase and I wanted to be sure
that each day�s pain was just about the same.

This went on for five days. I don�t know if Max
would have whipped her for seven; I didn�t care. I was now in charge and I had
decided that she had had enough. 

As far as Jesse was concerned, it didn�t matter
either. Her life was now defined by a morning whipping, a day of excruciating
pain, and a long uncomfortable sleep in the tomb-like darkness. She didn�t know
if this had gone on for five days or fifty.

I moved her to the soft bed upstairs where she
slept for 36 hours. When she woke, I shackled her hands and gave her a bath;
then I fed her a hot meal and put her back to bed. She was as weak as a kitten
and never looked at me directly or said a word. She slept for another 24 hours
and I repeated the bath. Again she was silent.

If nothing else, I now had her attention.

I was waiting the next morning when she opened
her bedroom door just as I had been a week before. Again, she was barefooted,
dressed in jeans and a sweatshirt, with wet hair. She stopped when she saw me
waiting. She still looked weak, but surprisingly healthy.

�How are you feeling?� I asked.

�Fine Master,� she answered head down. I looked
her over. My arms were crossed and I was leaning against the second-floor
railing.

�Strip,� I said quietly.

Moving quickly, she removed her clothes,
leaving the thong in place without being told. I was amazed at her
instantaneous, unquestioning response. Obviously, there was fear involved�she
didn�t want to go back to the safe-room�but there was something more, much
more. She had obeyed me without thinking�instinctually. I was beginning to
understand what she meant by a �power relationship.� 

I circled her in the wide hallway, reaching out
to feel the new muscle growth in her arms and legs. I was especially impressed
with her flat stomach and abs, which showed just a faint hint of the hardness
underneath. I had the distinct impression of velvet-covered metal, yet nothing
was bulging. Her torments had been designed to harden existing muscle rather
than build ugly bulk. Silently, I congratulated myself. I didn�t think it was
possible, but she looked even better than before, even more desirable. I could
feel myself getting hard.

�Dress,� I ordered. Immediately she put her
clothes back on. �You look even more beautiful,� I said. I could see a faint
smile cross her face. I returned to leaning against the hallway railing with my
arms crossed. She stood barefooted, very straight with her head down and her
hands at her side.

�I�m going away on a business trip for a few
days,� I said in a conversational tone. �I�ll be back late on Friday. I�ve left
you some money on my desk. There�s plenty of food in the kitchen.�

I waited a minute and then continued. �You can
come and go as you like until I get back. You�re free to use anything in the
house, including the computer, just don�t touch anything in my desk. I�ve added
you as a guest on my system, Jesse�Jesse.�

She remained silent. �On Saturday morning,
we�ll be driving upstate. I�ve arranged for you to get some specialized
training. You�ll be gone for two weeks.� 

She raised her head and looked at me curiously,
but just responded with a quiet, �yes, Master.�

I guess I had hoped for a change in attitude,
sadly I realized that that was asking too much. She could not act respectfully
and with familiarity at the same time. Being a real master was going to be
lonely. 

�I left you some coffee downstairs if you want
it,� I said. Then I turned and went back to my room, closing the door. The
first thing I did was jerk off; abstinence around her was going to be hard, I
thought. Then I finished packing. When I came out, she was gone. What did I
expect, a good-bye kiss? I carried my suitcase downstairs.

She was waiting for me by the front door, naked
except for the thong and kneeling, with her head down. She looked incredibly
luscious and it took all the willpower I had not to nail her right there on the
floor. Instead, I stepped around her kneeling body to get my jacket.

�May I speak, Master?� she asked. This was the
first time she had asked to speak since the basement. 

�Yes,� I replied.

Then she looked up at me and said simply,
�Please fuck me before you go.� It was the genuine sexual hunger of a 22-year
old girl, but there was something more. Behind the sex was a barely hidden plea
to give her back some of the control she had lost, to restore her ego.

After a week of manhandling her naked body,
there was nothing, literally nothing that I wanted more than to fuck her, but I
knew that giving in now would be a step back. I was resolved to stick to the
plan which meant no sex for a while. Luckily, I had also just jerked off.

�No, not yet,� I said in a matter-of-fact way.
Then, without looking at her, I said, �Please be ready to leave at 10 on
Saturday;� then I left.

&nbsp;

The drive upstate took three hours plus an hour
for lunch at a little restaurant just off the Taconic Parkway. I had given her permission (ordered her actually) to
speak freely and we talked�nothing important or intimate, but it was a start.

She asked me again how I knew so much about the
bastinado. (It was clear that she was fascinated with this general subject.) I
told her that I had studied a lot of history, both in school and on my own.

�Who were the cruelest people?� she asked
innocently, chomping on a carrot.

�The Romans,� I answered without hesitation.
�They institutionalized cruelty. Before them it was all about people�good
people and bad. After them, it became a government thing. It wasn�t personal
anymore and people absolved themselves of responsibility. 

�Remember Spartacus and the slave revolt?� I
asked. She nodded, but her eyes urged me to continue. The Romans crucified
6,000 slaves and no one batted an eyelash. Do you know how much organization it
took to get 6,000 strong men nailed to a cross one at a bloody time? Imagine
waiting for your turn; imagine thinking about the horribly painful death that
was coming.

�I know how they felt,� she said half joking. I
looked at her sharply; I didn�t want her punishments to be taken lightly.

�We can do that again when we get home.� I said
seriously. There was real terror in her eyes. �Do you want that?� I asked.

�No Master,� she replied, cowed. I hated to
bring that tone to our civilized lunch, but I knew that she needed to respect
the pain that I gave her, not diminish it once it was over.

�The Romans were especially cruel to their
slaves, especially the girls,� I continued. She looked at me with some
interest, still wary about saying the wrong thing. �The most beautiful became a
secondary form of money and were traded all the time. It actually resulted in
better treatment as marking a female slave reduced her value. They still
practiced corporal punishment, but carefully, always looking for new ways to
hurt the slave without damaging her. It became a hobby for some.�

She looked at me and then screwed up her
courage and spoke. �It sounds very much like a CELT contract. Men trade the
girls and try to find inventive ways to keep them in line without any visible
damage.� She was staring at me directly. There was no disrespect, but she stood
her ground. Once again I admired her courage.

I was also glad to see that she had not lost
her spirit, but I just looked at her evenly and said, �There�s one important
difference Jess�a CELT�s bondage is consensual.�

�Yes, you�re right,� she said, �consensual.�
Then she stood up and walked to the car. I paid the bill and followed.

&nbsp;






XII



The sign read Bitter Wells Horse Farm. It was
remote, at least 20 miles off the main road. This was horse country and I was
sure that by now Jesse had guessed the nature of her training. She didn�t say
anything, just continued to stare out the window. What could she say?

We drove up the farm road until we came to a
collection of buildings, including a well-kept barn. A small group of men were
gathered around something that I couldn�t see. One of them broke away and
walked over to the car.

�Mr. Lowe?� the man asked in a friendly way. I
nodded and we shook hands. �Jack Warden,� he said. �Welcome to Bitter Wells. I
got your check and the paperwork last week. We�re all set for you. He ignored
Jess, who had walked over to us from the other side of the car.

�Is this the girl?� he asked nodding in her
direction.

�Yes,� I said.

�Do you want to turn her over now?� he asked. I
nodded yes.

�OK, well you just need to give her the order
and we�ll get started,� his friendly attitude was comforting.

I turned to Jesse and said, �I want you to obey
this man and his associates.� 

Immediately, he stepped over to Jesse, turned
her around, and cuffed her wrists behind her back. Without a single wasted
motion, he pulled a bridle from his belt and fit it over her head, pushing a
hard-rubber bit between her teeth. Quickly he tightened one bridle strap behind
her neck, another under her chin, and a third at the side of her head then he
clipped two short reins to the metal ring on one side of her mouth bit. Two
leather flaps near her eyes prevented any side vision.

Jesse stood motionless as the bridle was
strapped on, staring at me. I stared back, betraying nothing of what I was
feeling inside. In truth, I was terrified of leaving her. I could sense that
she was afraid as well. She had never been to a horse farm; I could see it in
the way she responded clumsily to Jack�s manhandling.

Then he unbuttoned the front of her shirt and
pulled it down to her waist. �We�ll get her stripped down and prepared later,�
he said. �Right now I need to attend to one of our ponies. Want to watch?� I
nodded, not really understanding what he meant by �attend to.� He led Jesse
away by the reins and I followed.� 

When we got closer I could see that the crowd
was gathered around a horizontal wooden rail maybe eight feet long, set on two
thick posts. A tall Asian girl, completely naked and absolutely gorgeous had
been stretched over the rail on her stomach and her wrists and ankles secured
by thick leather straps on the sides of the posts. Her head was pulled back by
the hair with a rawhide cord that was tied to the top of a silver hook, which
had been inserted in her ass. 

The straps, which were near the bottom of the
posts, pulled her long body taunt and motionless. She glanced over at me, the new
arrival in the circle. I could see that she was straining to hold her head up
and keep the hook from penetrating farther up her ass, but her eyes were still
blazing with fury.

Jack continued walking to another hitching rail
and pushed Jesse to her knees, tying her reins around the rail so that she was
forced to look at the Asian girl. At least five other girls were tied to the
same rail in a similar fashion. All of them were naked. A second rail nearby
held anther half a dozen �ponies� tied in the same position.

Jack addressed the small group of men. �Thank
you all for stopping bye. Let me introduce Mr. Lowe here,� He pointed at me; I
nodded. ��our newest member.� Several of the men glanced over and nodded.

Then he walked over to the punishment rail and
rested his hand on Asian girl�s bare ass. �This here�s Ming,� he said, as he
unhooked a mean looking whip from his belt and shook it to allow the lashes to
untangle. The were made of rawhide.

�Yesterday, she pushed one of our stable boys.
We don�t tolerate behavior like that around here. Her punishment is to be
whipped for ten minutes. The girl remained perfectly silent and still. She
reminded me of Jesse in an obstinate mood.

He directed himself to the two hitching
posts.� �I want all you other ponies to
watch this and remember it.� 

He stepped behind the girl and exercised the
whip. For some reason the girl looked at me again, there was terror in her
eyes. Jack started slowly, moving the whip from one ass cheek to the other. I
could see that each rawhide lash left a small red line in her skin. After a few
more strokes, he shifted to her legs, working the tips of the lash into the
tender inside of her thigh. Patiently he moved from one leg to the other. The
girl screamed and jerked now with each stroke hopelessly trying to free herself
from the rail. I glanced at my watch�one minute. At the two minute mark, her
ass and back were bright red and she was hysterical with the pain. She screamed
for him to stop and surprisingly he did.

�I�ll give her some time to calm down and then
start again on her back,� he said. �This break won�t affect her whipping time;
around here, ten minutes means ten minutes.� 

The girl�s body was shaking violently and tears
were flowing down her face in a steady stream. I could see her hands
desperately opening and closing and her bare feet arching as she tried to shake
off the pain. Her face contorted in agony as another blow landed and realized,
surprisingly, that I was rock hard. She was suffering for me; I found that idea
pleasing.

In about a minute Jack started again. The girl
was moaning and screaming again within a few strokes. I could tell that he was
adjusting the force of the whipping so that she was in a fairly constant and
intense pain, but not in danger of passing out. Strangely, her screams seemed
almost natural out here in the open air with the mountains in the background.
Most of the men were looking on with interest; obviously, this was nothing new,
but I got the sense that a whipping was something they liked to discuss at the
bar.

I looked over at the pony-girls strapped to the
other rails. Some had their eyes closed, but some were watching intently and
breathing heavily. I realized that they were as turned on as the men by the
show, Jesse most of all. 

By the end of her ten minutes, Ming was only
half conscious. The hook was fully up her ass now and her head drooped a little
as a result. Jack coiled his whip and reattached it to his belt then he
adjusted the rawhide strap on her hair so it was tight. He turned to the men. �Thank
you for coming. It�s good for the girls to see the membership working together.
We�ll take her down in a few hours,� he said, pointing to Ming. I like them to
think about what they done while the hook is still inside and their backside is
still burning.�



The men
started walking away. I took a final look at Ming. She was in a painful stupor,
almost a drugged state, but her muscles were contracting as she squeezed the
wooden rail with her legs. Was she having an orgasm, I wondered?

Jack came
over and started walking me back to my car. �We�ll see you in two weeks, Mr.
Lowe,� he said. �Don�t worry; I�ll take good care of your girl.� I glanced over
at Jesse; the wounded look in her eyes followed me all the way down the path.



The next two weeks were the longest of my life.
I realized two things: first, that I wanted her more than anything I had ever
wanted before; and second, just how dangerous it was to feel that way. It was a
classic case of obsession. Fortunately, I was smart enough to recognize the
symptoms; it was even more fortunate was that she was 150 miles away.

The drive back to Bitter Wells was filled with
fear and uncertainty. How had she responded to the training? The farm was all
about humility; could Jesse learn humility�really learn it in her heart? I
didn�t know; what I did know was that the next few days would define our year
together, if we had a year together. 

After registering at the farm�s guest quarters,
I wondered over to the clubhouse. Jack was seated at the bar drinking a cup of
coffee. 

�How are you, Mr. Lowe,� he said cheerfully,
getting up to shake hands, signally me to sit in the stool next to his. �Good
trip?�

�Fine,� I said. �How�s my CELT?� I wanted to
get down to business. 

�A little anxious to get back to your filly,
huh?� he laughed. �Don�t blame you none, that�s one incredibly beautiful girl
you got there. And she�s strong too, I wouldn�t have believed it, but under
that skin she�s got some hard-assed muscles. You better watch yourself around
her, especially now that we�ve been running her for a couple of weeks.�

I smiled and nodded. Actually, I was jogging a
lot farther than usual and playing tennis every day now. My forearms were like
steel. I wasn�t worried about being able to handle her.

�We did have some trouble with her at first;
got kind of an independent streak. Most of the time, we encourage that;
spirited ponies are much better runners, but she just wouldn�t obey. I had to
put her on the rail a couple of times.� I frowned. �Don�t worry, I didn�t make
any marks,� he said quickly. �She settled down a little after that, but I
really couldn�t tell if she was just going along to avoid the pain.� He took a
few sips from his cup. �You want some coffee� breakfast? I indicated no to
both. 

He continued, �Once we paired her up though,
she calmed right down.� I could see that he enjoyed giving this detailed
explanation. �Around here, when one member of a pair acts up, they both get
whipped. We tie them to the rail, one on top of the other and face-to-face. I
guess she didn�t like seeing her partner screamin� for her badness.�

�They run pretty well together now. Thanks for
your check, by the way. Your accounts all paid up� �till Tuesday.� He stopped
and finished his coffee. ��want to take her out for a run? Ever handled a team
before?�

�I�d love to take her out, Jack,� I answered,
�and no, I�ve never done this before.�

�No problem, it�s easy,� he replied. �Today you
can use the starter rig and just stick to the beginner�s path. Your team can
move along pretty well, but they�re gentle for the most part. Give us another
three weeks with your girl and we�ll turn her into a fast quarter-miler.� I
just smiled and shook my head no. �I don�t blame you,� he said, disappointed,
�but maybe you�ll change your mind after you see her sprint tomorrow. There�s
money up here in girl racing, but I understand�she�s a real beauty. First
things first, let�s just get you started for now.�

He led me outside and we walked into the
stable. 

Half a dozen girls were standing, lined up on
the side of the stable. They were all bridled and chained close to the wall by
their mouth bits, so close in fact that their nipples and cunts had to be
brushing against the stall�s rough wood. Each wore a ponytail that stuck out
from the back of their head. Their wrists were also shackled, pulled up hard
behind, and tied tightly with rawhide over the opposite shoulder to some point
in their front that I couldn�t see; they all stood ramrod straight. A butt-plug
had been inserted into each gorgeous ass and secured with a crotch strap.
Horsehair or what looked like horsehair hung down from each ass. They all wore
strange, hoof-like shoes strapped to their feet.

Jesse was the third to the right. Standing next
to her was the Asian girl who had been whipped the day I dropped Jesse off. Both
of them were magnificent standing high and straight in their� 

Jack saw me staring at the shoes. �They�re
called pony shoes,� he said, noting my interest. �They arch the foot and
transfer most of the ground shock to the leg just like a real horse. We also
like them because they stretch their legs and raise their asses. What do you
think?� He was right of course; they all looked incredibly beautiful, a little
like Las Vegas showgirls. I nodded and smiled.

��This
here�s Ming,� Jack said, running his hand down her back and flank as he talked.
�And you recognize this beauty of course,� he said, as he gave Jess a playful
pat on her hard ass. Ming turned her head and tried to look at the source of
the sound. Just like a curious horse, I thought. Jesse continued to stare at
the wall.

�Well, I got to say she don�t look all that
happy to see you, Mr. Lowe,� Jack was smiling. �That�s good actually; she�s
high-strung and naturally miffed that you left her behind. Let�s let her pout
for a while.� I nodded. He had spoken in front of her as if she couldn�t
understand the meaning of the words. I realized that this was part of the
program�don�t do anything to remind the girl that she�s human. 

�Let me show you how to hook them up,� he said,
walking over to the opposite wall. �This here�s a body harness.� He lifted two
leather harnesses off their hooks. They were made like the bridle, but much
larger. 

He moved back to Jesse and Ming, unhooked the
bit chains that held both girls against the wall, and turned them around. I looked
into Jesse�s eyes; she refused to meet my gaze. Then I looked down at their
breast. The wrist shackles were attached to their nipples, which had been
pierced vertically with a tiny gold bar, forcing them to keep their back arched
and their arms high. The nipple piercing had been pushed through some kind of
slotted washer to which the rawhide cord bar had been tied. 

�Yeah, we use bar piercing here at Bitter
Wells. Some farms use rings others use clips. The clips hurt like Hell, and
come off too easily. If you want, we take the bars out when you leave. �the
holes close up naturally in a few days. Personally, I like the way the bars
look straight up and down and they�re only fifty bucks for the set.�

He held each girls breast and turned the washer
until its slot was in line with the nipple piercing then he removed the washer.
Then he clipped the top of the body harness to the strap ring under Mind�s chin
and stepped behind her. �You got three straps to tighten,� he said, �at the
chest, the waist, and between the legs. The one between the legs splits in two
in the back so that we don�t interfere with the tail and buckles to the bottom
of the waist strap.� He demonstrated on Ming as he talked. �Once the body
straps are tight, you pull in their arms with the same straps by using a second
buckle. Nothing to remember, really, the straps fall naturally at the pony�s
biceps and at her elbow. Then you just buckle her wrists to the crotch strap so
that their hands don�t move around. 

He finished up and turned Ming fully around so
that I could see. The harness was now part of her body

Jack stepped back and invited me to try it out
with Jesse. She moved back when I touched her bare skin, but otherwise there
was no reaction as I positioned the thick straps and tightened them around her.

Jack walked back to the rack and retrieved a
lightweight metal rod. It had metal loops at the ends. There were two pairs of
flat points in the rod where horizontal slots had been cut. �This is called a
nipple bar,� Jack explained. �It attaches as so�� He retrieved two small chains
from the rack and attached one end to the outside of each girl�s mouth bit then
he lifted the rod and attached the chain to the metal loops at each end of the
bar. �It also attached to the nipples, like this.� He took a firm hold of
Ming�s breasts and turned then a quarter-turn until the vertical nipple
piercing was horizontal and in line with the slot in the bar then he pushed it
through. When he took his hand away, her breast returned to its normal
position, locking the bar in place. �The piercing is impossible to pull out
without the use of your hands,� he announced proudly. He stepped back again and
gestured for me to do the same to Jesse. I took hold of her breast. I had
forgotten how good she felt. Then I turned it as he had done and pushed her
nipple piece through the slot. I did the same with the other. There was no
expression on her face.

�The bar keeps their bodies straight when
they�re running and it allows you to steer,� he explained. Grabbing the bar in
the middle, he moved the two girls around the stable until they were standing
in front of a small one-man carriage. I could see that both girls were
responding immediately and lifting their feet high to his movement of the bar. 

�This here is called a drag,� he said. �It�s as
light and small as we can make it, but it�s still a drag for the ponies
compared to running free. Thus the name� We try to give them equal time running
with the drag and without so that they don�t develop any bad habits.� As he
talked, he attached the drag�s tongue to their harnesses at the chest and at
the waist. A two-point harness gives them the ability to retain their balance
and pull with both their upper and lower bodies. Then he attached two thin
leather reins to each side of the nipple bar. Finally, he joined the inside
rings of their bits with a short chain.

All of this is really simple; when you pull on
the rein, the steering bar, their nipples, and both mouth bits get pulled in
that direction. I guarantee you that the team will also move in that direction
to relieve the pressure. Pull back evenly on both when you want them to stop.� 

�Hop up here, Mr. Lowe, and I�ll show you.� I
did as he said. He handed me the reins. �Give me a pull to the left.� I pulled
on the left rein; both girls immediately turned their bodies to the left in
response to the pull on their nipples and their mouths. I pulled to the right
and observed the same reaction. I tried both pulls again and they responded in
exactly the same way.

Jack reached over and pulled the buggy whip
from its holder on the side of the carriage. You shouldn�t need to use this on
such an easy run, but if they give you any trouble, just snap this in their ass
or on their legs. It hurts like Hell, so use it sparingly. Snapping it over
their heads like this,� he demonstrated, �is the signal to move forward and to
go faster.� The girls moved forward reflexively as he demonstrated and he had
to grab the reins to hold them in place. It was amazing actually, they knew it
was just a demonstration, but their training had also made their responses
instinctual. Did they really think of themselves now, at least in part, as
animals? I wondered.

��If you
want to stop along the road, be sure to tie their reins to a fence or a tree.�
Then he leaned in close and whispered, �First time out with a new driver and
they always try to test the driver. Keep them on a tight rein and if they
really get feisty, unhook them from the carriage and give them a good whippin�.
Do them both the same, no matter who�s at fault. You�ll have a better ride
tomorrow if you do.�

Then he stood back and said, �Just follow the
dirt road to the right. It takes you around the lake and right back to this
spot� can�t get lost. Ming�s owner won�t be here until next week, so you can have
full use of the team while you�re here,� he looked at his watch. �Have them
back by five, okay. We like to feed them on a regular schedule. You�re welcome
to use Ming for sex tonight if you like, but I�m sure you�re anxious to get
reacquainted with Jesse. �your choice, or take them both if you want.� Out of
the corner of my eye I could see Jesse�s head swinging in our direction.
Because of the chain holding their heads together, Ming�s head turned at the
same time. 

�You�re all set. See you in a couple of hours.�
Then Jack stepped back.

I looked at the two pony asses in front of me,
tightened up on the reins, and snapped the whip over their heads. They stepped
out together at a walk, bending at the waist a little to take up the weight of
the carriage. It was amazing, their �shod� feet sounded exactly like horse
hooves. 

I tried a few slow turns as we rode down the
path. They responded instantly to pulls on the nipple bar just as Jack had
said. I watched the bar as we rode. It seemed to be balanced at the end of
their upturned nipples. I felt the reins in my hands; I pulled, they felt pain,
and turned in the direction I wanted us to go. It was stimulating to have such
control.� It was also an incredible
turn-on to watch their asses move and their leg muscles stretch at each step.
They were animals, I thought, beautiful creatures trained to work so that I
could ride in comfort. It was getting easier and easier to think of them in
this way. In fact, if it wasn�t for the fact that I wanted desperately to fuck
them both, their humanity would have totally left my mind. 

I wondered what it would be like to push them
faster, but caution won out and I kept them at a walking pace until we were
clear of the farm then I snapped the whip. They increased their speed to a slow
jog. I could see the muscles in their legs and back straining now to take up
the increased pull of the drag. I kept it this way for another mile. Sweat
dripped off their naked bodied, but they didn�t slacken the pace. I had the
sense that they could pull all day at this speed.

Suddenly, I noticed that Jesse had lost her
rhythm. This threw Ming off and the carriage started to swing erratically from
one side of the path to the other. I gave Jesse a sharp whack on her ass with
the whip and then another. She corrected her pace, but within half a mile again
lost it again. I knew what was happening.

I pulled sharply on the right strap and the
drag moved off the path. I stepped out and moved to the front of the team. Both
girls were breathing heavily, but did not appear to be tired. They were in
magnificent shape. I unhooked them from the carriage and led them by their
reins to a nearby wooden fence. They followed the pull on their nipples
obediently. Ming kept giving Jesse confused glances. Jesse starred straight
down. 

It was a rail fence, but tall, maybe four feet
high. �Step up on the bottom rail,� I ordered. Neither girl moved. I threw the
reins over the rail and pulled. Both of their nipples came up painfully. I
pulled again and the stepped onto the second rail. �Bend over the rail.� Again
neither girl moved; I was forced to pull down on the nipple bar to get them to
bend. I quickly tied the bar to the bottom rail and then to their inside
ankles. Then I took Ming�s right foot and tied it as high as I could to the top
rail. Her ass, her legs, and her inner tights were now fully exposed and
immobile. I could see Jesse�s left leg moving in anticipation. She expected to
be tied in a similar fashion for their punishment. 

I found a young sapling, broke off a branch and
cleaned it of leaves. Then I moved in behind Ming and whipped Ming viciously.
She was screaming through the bit. I waited until she was calm and then did it
again, and again, and again. By the time I was finished, she was writhing in
pain. Jesse, who could feel every stroke and every reaction, was crying as well
even though she had not been struck. 

I grabbed Jesse�s bridle and pulled her face to
mine, �Shall I do it again?� I asked her.

Jesse couldn�t speak, but she vigorously shook
her head no. �If you lose the pace again, I�ll mount her on a fence rail and
whip her raw.� Jesse blinked back the tears and nodded. The ride back was
easier and faster; Jesse, who was easily the stronger member of the team, never
lost the pace. 

A stable boy helped me get the girls out of
their harnesses and wiped down. I watched him as he washed them down with a
gentle hose and dried them off with towels. He treated them exactly as if they
were real ponies. The girls responded in the same way, never flinching even
when he cleaned inside their vaginas and reamed their asses with a padded and
oiled rod. It was obvious that the de-humanizing process was part of their
total experience.

I tipped him and left.



After a
simple dinner with the other guests, I returned to the stable and walked to the
stall that the girls shared. The boy had left them standing naked, chained to
the wall. I stepped past Jesse and untied Ming. Then I led her away to my room.
I could hear Jesse trying to say something through the bit and stomping her bare
feet on the wooden floor.



Every room had an interesting feature for the
use of the guests. It was a man-size figure of a horse running with its legs
fully extended; the horse�s head and its ass were missing. There were eye-bolts
half-hidden by the false hair along the length on each leg and a steel head
brace rose up at the neck. I put Ming on the horse, pulling her body tight over
the frame by using the most extreme eye-bolts. Then I removed her bridle and
locked her head in the brace.

I stood back; in the firelight she looked
amazing like a running horse. I moved in close, fondling her breasts and her
swollen cunt for several minutes, enjoying the feel of her taunt body. She
responded to my touch and started to push her crotch into the horse� back. After
a while she came with a gentle shudder. 

�She loves you,� she said unexpectedly.

I looked at her in surprise and replied, �CELTs
who talk without permission are normally whipped.� The light from the room�s
fireplace was dancing on her tanned skin.

�She loves you,� she repeated.

I grabbed a cane from the umbrella rack by the
door and gave her five hard strokes on each ass cheek. She was sucking breath
in through her clenched teeth by the time I finished.

�Got anything else to say?� I asked.

�She lo� loves you,� the girl replied, still in
extreme pain.

I moved in front of her to look into her eyes.
I was moving the cane threateningly. It was clear that I was ready to do it
again. �What do you care?� I asked, angrily.

�She�s my drag partner,� was the only reply.
For some strange reason, this actually made sense to me. 

I looked at her for a long minute and then
said, �Unfortunately, she doesn�t love me as much as I love her.� 

She looked up at me and said, �She does now.�



I walked
back to the umbrella stand and put the cane back. Then I walked back to the
girl�s front and pushed my cock into her mouth. The time for talking was
finished. She sucked it hard for several minutes. Then I moved behind. She rode
me like a jockey with her just-cleaned and oiled ass then did the same when I
switched to her cunt. Finally, I returned to her mouth and came; she swallowed
everything and then sucked me dry with enthusiasm. I left her stretched on the
horse and went to sleep feeling satisfied, listening to her easy breathing. In
the morning, I used her again and then dropped her off at the stable before
heading to breakfast. I didn�t bother to look into Jesse�s stall.



After breakfast, I harnessed the girls to the
drag myself. Jesse was silent and docile. Ming was smiling throughout. Jack
walked over and examined my work; then he said, �Good job. Want to try some
sprints this morning?� I nodded, curious.

�OK, let�s get them out of the drag.� In a
minute we had the team un-harnessed and the drag moved away against the wall.
Jack went to the back of the stable and retrieved a cart that looked like it
was used for harness racing.

�This is a racer,� he said as he moved it into
position. It�s smaller and lighter that those used at the track, but still
designed for speed. He attached it to their harnesses. Taking the reins in one
hand he led the team to the back of the stable. 

�This is our track,� he said, pointing to a
long grassy path that wound around the meadow for maybe a quarter of a mile.
Keep it slow the first few times around until you get the hang of it then you
can let them go. Try to use the whip as little as possible so they can
concentrate on their rhythm, but don�t let them slack off either.

I nodded and snapped the whip. The girls moved
out slowly onto the path. I cracked it again and they picked up speed. After
two times around, I snapped the whip hard and they moved out at a fast jog. It
was easy to keep them on the track, but I could see how important it was that
they worked together as we went faster. We went around once this way, they I
snapped it again and they started to race. It was amazing watch their legs
pumping in perfect harmony. Jesse, the stronger of the pair, seemed to be
holding back to allow Ming to keep up. I used the whip on Ming and she picked
up her speed to keep up with Jesse�s faster pace. There is a lot more to racing
than holding the reins, I thought. At one point, their ponytail-ed hair was
actually flying back from the wind.

I stopped them after the second fast lap. They
were both breathing hard and glistening with sweat, but they were not in any
kind of distress. I was amazed at their stamina. I would have had a hard time
with such fast laps even without the racer attached. 

What magnificent creatures, I thought. They
were better than humans now, more valuable by far and a breed apart. I was
confused by this thinking. Weren�t humans the highest life form; and wasn�t our
humanity the thing we prized above all else? �interesting�� 

I waited until their breathing slowed and then
glanced over at Jack who was leaning back on a fence rail. He nodded and I
snapped the whip again. This time, after just a few fast laps they were
noticeably more tired and I needed to use the whip on both girls several times
to maintain the pace. I could tell that they were finished racing for the day. 

I stopped the racer in front of Jack. �Good
run,� he said. We�ll water and rest them and you can take them out again this
afternoon. As you can see, we�ve done a pretty good job with only two weeks of
work.� I nodded in enthusiastic agreement.



Later in the
afternoon, I took them on a long trot, returning to the stable exactly at five.
After dinner, I went and fetched Ming. Unlike the prior evening, Jesse didn�t
move or make a sound as I led Ming out of their stall. I fucked her repeatedly
while she rode the horse in my room. Afterward, we slept together wrapped in
each other�s arms.



I didn�t run the team the next morning,
preferring to rest and catch up on a little work. That afternoon, I hitched
them up to the drag and ran them at a steady pace for about three miles. Then I
stopped to rest by a small pond. I took both girls out of the harness and
bridle and allowed them to drink from the pond and cool off in the water while
I lay against a tree. After some initial shyness, they started to fool around
like kids. I enjoyed watching them play for a while then I stripped off my own
clothes and joined them in the water.

They hesitated at first then Ming splashed me a
little. I responded by dunking her and the melee was on. We all enjoyed the
time and ended up lying together on the grass. Jesse was playful, but reserved.
She was obviously still hurt from the rejection of the prior two evenings.

After a while, I rolled Ming to her back and
put on her wrist cuffs then I did the same with Jesse. Both girls watched me
curiously, but without fear. Then I stood Ming up and positioned her under a
horizontal branch belonging to one of the nearby oaks. Attaching the long rein
to her wrists, I pulled her arms up until she was on her toes. Jesse sat up on
her knees and watched, there was fear in her eyes now, but she didn�t say
anything.

I fetched the buggy whip from the drag and
tossed it at Jesse�s feet.

�Whip her until I tell you to stop,� I ordered.
Jesse looked at me with a confused expression, and then shook her head no. I
walked over to Ming and raised her up until she was off the ground. 

�You know what this feels like,� I said. �Now
do as you�re told or we can just watch her suffer all afternoon.� Ming was
beginning to cry out from the pain. She had heard every word.

�Please Jess, Pleaseeeee, my arms�� her
breathing was labored even after a few seconds in the air. 

Jesse looked at me and said, �Please, Howard,
don�t make me do this.�

I ignored her and sat down on the ground in a
comfortable position to watch Ming suffer. After a few second, Jesse picked up
the whip and took a position behind her friend. Then she started to softly lash
the girl. 

�She can stay up there all day if that�s what
you want. Now lay it into her. I want to see red marks on every inch of her
body.� I said in a totally serious voice.

�Please, Jess, just do it,� Ming screamed in a
desperate voice. �You�re just making it worse.�

Jesse started to apply the whip with moderate
force which didn�t leave much of a mark. She looked over at me and I shook my
head, indicating that it wasn�t good enough. She began to whip the girl hard,
moving methodically down both sides of her body. I could see that Jesse was
shaking after each stroke and each accompanying scream. After a while, Ming grew
quiet.

�Stop,� I said. Jesse threw the whip to the
ground, collapsed and started to cry hysterically. I let Ming down then took
her to the pond and gently rubbed cool water over her body.

�I�m sorry,� I said. She looked at me with
sudden understanding and nodded.

The ride back was slow with Ming straining
painfully in her harness. Jesse tried to do most of the work, but the drag was
designed to be pulled by a team with an even distribution of work. Ming had to
do her share. After a while, I stepped out of the drag and walked alongside.
The stable boy looked at me with disapproval when he saw Ming�s red-marked
body, but he didn�t say anything. 

I went off to dinner, which was excellent.
Surprisingly, I felt little remorse. I guess this is what they mean by a hard
heart, I thought.

That evening, I went to the stable and as usual
I approached Ming. The boy had applied some soothing lotion to her welts, but
it was obvious that she couldn�t really be touched that evening. I took her off
the wall and gently laid her on the stall�s one blanket. She curled up and went
immediately to sleep. I untied Jesse, apparently my second choice, and led her
off to my room.

Once we were in the room, I strapped Jesse to
the horse. She looked magnificent stretched out over the frame. She watched me
as I tied her head in place, but I didn�t look her in the eyes. Then I closed
the lights and went to bed. The only light was from a low fire that I had left
burning.� 

We both lay awake in the darkness. I could hear
movement and a gentle crying from the horse.

Softly, I heard her whisper something. It was
so soft that I had to strain to hear it. It was as if it was coming from inside
her. �Please love me, Master.� She was repeating it over and over, like a
prayer.

I got up and stood in front of her. I was naked
and my penis was at exactly the same level as her mouth. She could lift her
head a bit to look up into my face.

�Do you accept me as your Master?� I said in a
low voice.

�No,� she replied. �I don�t need to accept you.
You are my Master.� It was said simply and it just felt like the truth. I moved
my cock closer to her mouth. She stretched her head and was just able to lick
the tip. After a few seconds of this, I stepped forward and pushed my cock down
her throat. She embraced it as if it were a missing part of her own body. I
started to fuck her hard. I could see her moving in rhythm with my thrusts. She
came when I came and there were tears in her eyes. I un-strapped her from the
horse and we slept in each other�s arms until morning when we make sweet love
in the bed. I returned her to the stable and went to breakfast. 

That day was an easy one for the team and once
again we all enjoyed the pond. Both girls were a little nervous that there
would be a repeat of yesterday�s unprovoked punishment, but that was good. I
preferred a little tension mixed in with our fun.

The next morning, Jesse said her tearful
goodbyes to Ming and we drove home.






XIII



Our time at Bitter Wells defined our
relationship. 

Jesse moved into my bedroom, maintaining hers
as �private space� which I respected. She has also gone back to school under
the guise of being my live-in girlfriend. Not that I�m concerned anymore about
making her status as a CELT public. In fact, I still can�t believe that that
was once my highest priority. Jesse�s just more comfortable keeping that part
of our lives private.

We have our times of tender love as well as our
times of bondage and pain. In between is an easy friendship. It�s not the
friendship of friends�that is, equals, sharing common experience; it�s the
friendship of lovers�a kind of constant non-sexual intercourse where one of us
is naturally subordinate to the other. Jesse seems to thrive in it. I don�t
know why exactly; I just know that she does.

Maybe it�s what she said; this kind of
relationship is a complex soup of emotions. All I know is that it�s beyond
ordinary love, way beyond. If you can imagine!

Her contract ends in six months. I�m saving my
money. 

The
End
