The Line
Between

By Jeremy
Binder

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

He did not consider
himself a masochist, at least not based on what he heard or read.� Yet, she softened his resolve.� He was putty in her hands, so to speak, and she
played him like a puppet, slowing stroking his cock and his mind until every
thought that raced through his mind turned toward his one perceived need.� Orgasm.�
He desperately needed to cum, or so he thought, but she had long ago
taken control in that arena.

&nbsp;

An onlooker might
believe that the moment occurred as she fastened the final strand of rope to
her bed frame, and to see him naked and bound with his limbs stretched tightly
to the four corners of her bed, the point was difficult to argue.� However, the two lovers knew
differently.� It was not ropes or leather
cuffs that held him securely in her grip; it was what she did to him.� Their journey of erotic teasing and torment had
cemented his will.� He placed himself in
her hands, despite knowing how difficult she would make it for him to endure.� Her angelic Southern voice spilt words and
images into his mind that left him no choice but to submit to her wonderful and
devilish antics.� She had won his
devotion, the very first time she bound him and teasingly tantalized his
sensitive cock.� The things he now willingly
performed and endured in order to please her or feel her touch were beyond both
their imaginations.

&nbsp;

&quot;Anika,
please pinch them harder.&quot;

&nbsp;

His
urgency and desperation.� Even she was
amazed.� She watched him.� She watched his chest heave up and down.� She watched his panicked breathing.� With every calculation she made to get him to
this point, she never expected this response.�
She squeezed his nipples between her thumbs and forefingers.� Her hands shook with the effort.� He gasped, but thrust his hips toward her.

&nbsp;

She
crawled down his body, kissing his tender nipples and then biting them once
more for good measure.� He gasped in
surprise.� She lessened her grip with her
teeth and gently sucked and chewed on his tiny hard nipples.� He gasped each time the clenched her teeth.� The pain sent shock waves between his nipples,
brain, and cock, which stirred again. �She
had been teasing him for almost three hours.�
She reached down between his legs, and wrapped her fingers delicately
around his shaft.� She loved to feel him
grow hard in her hand.

&nbsp;

She
tired of playing with his nipples and crawled further down his stretched and
bound body kissing his chest and stomach along the way.� When her face lie inches from his sex, she
paused.� She gazed from between his legs
up his torso.� The olive skin of his legs
and abdomen were covered with a thin blanket of dark hair.� She never understood why his body hair turned
her on.� Perhaps she found it manly, or
perhaps because it was such a stark contrast to her own body.� Against his dark complexion rising urgently
between his thighs were his bare and pinkish cock and balls.� She had shaven him earlier, and his balls looked
like swollen eggs.� His bareness left him
looking completely vulnerable.� She loved
the way his cock danced before her.� She
slowly and lightly tickled his scrotum, causing him to jump.� She slowly ran her fingertips up and down his
shaft a few times before drawing circles with her index finger round and round
his cockhead.� Finally, she wrapped
several her thumb and forefinger gently around his shaft and slid her ringed
fingers up and down his shaft.� His cock
looked harder than usual.� She wondered
if it was her imagination.� His private
scent drew her lips closer and closer to the tiny spot just below the head of
his cock that she knew would drive him crazy.�
She drew a line with her tongue from the beneath his balls along their
seam to the tip of his cock, until she caught his corona with the tip of her
tongue.� She flicked it, and he sharply
drew his breath.� They both knew what lie
ahead, and while she felt pure excitement at the thought, his feelings were a
combination of excitement and fear.� She
had brought him to the edge a dozen times over the last hour.� This time would be no different, except for his
increased level of desperation and greater sincerity of his begging.

&nbsp;

She
licked him again.� His cock was so hard!� His cockhead was so engorged that its shiny
purple skin covering looked as if it might tear.� Bound as he was, he was completely vulnerable
to her attack.� She licked without
urgency.� He had taught her this, for
which he both praised and cursed himself.�
She licked him again, lightly dragging the tip of her tongue around the corona
of his cockhead and then back down the length of his engorged shaft.

&nbsp;

&quot;Anika,
please more.&quot;

&nbsp;

He
was getting to that place again.� She
could tell.� Hell, anyone could tell had
they been watching.� She wrapped her lips
gently around his cockhead and sucked slowly and carefully.� He could blow at any moment.� Not yet.�
She was not finished with him.�
She was determined to tease him this time until she erased from his mind
the line between pleasurable teasing and excruciating torture.� His words had long ago become inaudible.� He moaned and pleaded between ragged breaths.� She loved this.� She lost herself in this place that only she
could lead him to and from.� It was the
most delicious and exquisite torture in the world.� She released his cock from her wet mouth and blew
a light stream of air where her tongue had been.

&nbsp;

&quot;Anika,
pleeeeaaaase touch me.�
Pleeeaaaase!&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;I
am touching you, baby.&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Please
don't stop.� Touch me!&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Baby,
calm yourself.� You know I have no
intention of stopping.� I won't stop
until Sunday.&quot;

&nbsp;

Sunday,
another 12 hours.� Anika did not know if she
could keep this up another five minutes let alone through the night, but she would
never tell him that.� It was nearly
impossible to keep him so close to the edge without mistakenly pushing him over
the edge, which would ruin her plans, but somehow she managed.� She sucked the length of his cock into her
mouth again, and Jeremy wailed.� This was
her favorite part, completely uninhibited sexual freedom.� She could no longer distinguish between
loving tenderness and erotic sadism.� She
timed her strokes, carefully keeping him near the edge.� She felt his heat radiate from his penis, as it
quivered against her tongue.� Despite her
compassion for him, she would show no mercy tonight.� He may not believe it now, but he had wanted
this, and once they began their journey, her need to see him suffer, the power
she felt, her ability to command his complete submission, grew in her like a
consuming fire.� She fed on her desire, as
she played his finely tuned body.

&nbsp;

His
composure left him.� She so easily took
him to this place.� She knew exactly how
to touch him.� She knew precisely what to
whisper into his ear.� She owned him,
which was inevitable, given his reactions to her touch.� In fact, she told him this would happen, when
they first met, even though neither of them knew exactly what she meant.� Yet, here they were.� With his wrists and ankles encased in soft leather
and pulled tightly to the four corners of her bed, his eyes blanketed with a black
silk scarf and his body glistening with sweat from tugging on his bonds in an
attempt to get closer to her touch.� She
sucked his cock and lingered with her tongue rubbing up and down inside her
mouth, there before pulling away.

&nbsp;

�Anika,
no, please touch me.� I can�t stand it!�

&nbsp;

She
loved the terror he felt each time she broke contact with his penis.� Jeremy never knew if she would allow him to
cum or make him wait until next time they made love, or longer.� Anika loved instilling that fear.� Honestly, he loved it too.� There was nothing more exciting than for her to
keep him this way, for her to decide his fate.

&nbsp;

She
crawled up his body.� She needed to feel
his tongue on her clit.

&nbsp;

&quot;Anika,
please don't stop touching me!&quot;

&nbsp;

She
said nothing.

&nbsp;

She
pressed her clit toward his tongue.� He
thought better of complaining and gently lapped at her.� He lifted his head and tried his best to
please her.� Despite his desperation, which
his cock clearly demonstrated, bobbing wildly into the air screaming for attention,
he felt complete adoration for her.� No
one had ever done this to him.� No one
had ever made him feel this way.� He
worshipped her, drawing circles along the edge of her hood in an urgent attempt
to give her the orgasm that he desperately craved for himself.� She urged him on and quickly felt a tightness
building between her thighs.

&nbsp;

&quot;Baby,
you know if I cum, we're all done until tomorrow morning,&quot; she teased.

&nbsp;

&quot;No,
please don't.� Don't stop touching
me.� Anika, please.&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Jeremy,
you want me to cum, don�t you?� Why would
you deprive me?&quot;

&nbsp;

He
refocused between her legs, grabbing her clit between his lips and pulling it
into his mouth against his tongue.� He
rubbed her swollen bud with the flat of his tongue, slowly and lightly at
first, then building in intensity.

&nbsp;

In
the end, their game would end as she saw fit.�
In the beginning of their relationship, she had a difficult time making
the leap from teasing and pleasing him to relentlessly teasing him and leaving
him unfulfilled, but the rewards had been worth it.� She knew that no matter how desperately he
felt he needed to cum, she had softened his will, and he would abide by her
decision.� Despite his painfully hard
erection waving for attention, all he could think about at this moment was
making her happy.� The elation he felt when
she cascaded over the edge was more powerful than the need he felt between his
legs.� He wanted to make her cum.� He wanted it more than anything.� To please her.� Perhaps he truly was submissive.� There was nothing he could do to relieve his
agony.� He had asked for this, long
ago.� There were times when he regretted
his decision, but this fantasy lie in her hands, and she would decide its
ending.

&nbsp;

She
pressed against his tongue, &quot;Coax it from me, Jeremy.� I�m so close!&quot;

&nbsp;

Damn
her!� She always knew what to say.� He was so confused.� He did not want this to end, but knew it would.� His cock begged him to stop and try to convince
her to touch him one more time.� More
powerful, however, was his need to make her orgasm.� He only wanted to please her now.� He silently begged her with his tongue against
her very swollen clit.� Imagine it!� He was determined to finish her off, so that he
could spend the rest of the night suffering in quiet torment.� He sucked slowly and firmly on her clit.� To her, this was the most seductive feeling
in the world.� The combination of his
tongue and mouth felt like a small suction cup against her nerve center imploring
her to let go.

&nbsp;

She
ripped off his blindfold.� She wanted to
see his eyes.� She wanted him to look at
her.� She grabbed his sore nipples and
clenched.� He no longer cringed with
pain.� He was past that.� He had a wild look in his eyes.

&nbsp;

&quot;Pinch
them harder,&quot; he growled.

&nbsp;

She
did.� The moment was no longer
tender.� She gripped his nipples and
pulled herself forcefully onto his dancing tongue.� He held her tightly with his mouth and his will.� The desperation of his predicament was completely
overshadowed by the elation he felt as she tensed her stomach and thighs and
spasmed.� Her eyes rolled back and, with
a cry, she released her tension from deep inside her.� She came for moments, then collapsed on top
of him and held him tightly.� He tried to
reach for her, but was reminded once more that he was bound.

&nbsp;

He
felt her relief.� His desperation left him
momentarily.� They kissed a warm thank
you and closed their eyes.� He felt the
peacefulness of evening, as they lay together.�
His lopsided breathing subsided.�
His nipples were swollen, but the pain was gone.� His cock calmed for a moment, but eventually
tightness and throbbing returned, especially when Anika casually rested her
fingertips across his shaft. �He did not
feel the same desperate throbbing he had felt when her fingers and tongue tantalized
him.� This was more of an uncomfortable
and constant reminder of what she did to him, of what she could do to him any
time.� This was their life.

&nbsp;

This
was how they played.� He never imagined
that anyone could do this to him, for him.�
He smiled.� He felt relaxed and
tense at the same time, yet he felt peaceful.�
He needed something.� He needed
release.� He needed to climax.� Yet, he knew he would not.� Not until Sunday.� He loved and hated this feeling, and his
ambivalence was part of her plan.� He
felt her embrace and knew its meaning.�
She was tired, and their playtime was over until tomorrow morning.� He knew his journey through the evening would
be as difficult as the last several hours, but there was nothing for him to do
except endure it.� He was hers.� His cock was hers, and he wanted nothing
more.

&nbsp;

Damn
her.� Damn, damn, damn her.� She was a gift from heaven.
