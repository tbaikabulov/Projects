PROLOGUE

It was 3 AM local time and outside of the luxurious beachside resort in Thailand, the only noise that filled the peaceful night�s air was that of the waves rolling in and out. Up in the sky, amongst the full moon and thousands of stars, a single star shot through the sky. Falling rapidly, it began to glow red as it entered the earth�s atmosphere. With a dull whistle it shot rapidly towards the beach, but as it neared the sea level it rapidly slowed. Still, it struck the sandy beach with a lot of force, and in an explosion of sand, it created a small crater. At that hour, there was no one about so no one saw the meteor strike the surface. If they had, they would have noticed that thing that had fallen from the sky was actually not a meteor, but some sort of glowing metal capsule. The capsule started to rotate like a drill bit and slowly dug itself even deeper, the sand around it falling on top of it as it did, filling the hole that it made behind it until it was completely buried. Still the capsule dug, deeper, hundreds of feet, for a destination and purpose unknown. When the high tide came in the water eroded what remained of the hole, filling the small crater with sand and erasing all evidence of the impact.




I walked along the sandy beach, enjoying the feel of the wet sand between my toes and the water lapping at my feet as the tide came in. I squinted, watching the orange sun peak over the horizon. It was dawn in Thailand and at the private beach at the exclusive resort that my parents had taken us, my sister Stacy and I were literally the only ones on the secluded beach at this early hour. We had gotten up deliberately to see the sunrise, waking up at the crack of dawn, slipping on our bikinis and heading down to the beach. This was our first full day in Thailand and it was the first real alone time I had gotten with my older sister in quite a while. She had just returned from her first year of college while I had just finished my last year of high school. If somebody didn�t know us, they probably would not have guessed we were sisters. She had inherited my dad�s features and had brown hair and brown eyes, while I was a blonde with blue eyes, like my mom. She was shy and introverted; I was outgoing and admittedly a bit of a wild child. She was very smart, perhaps a little bookish, and gone off to Princeton; I was looking forward to the public party school I would be attending next year, where I would finally be away from the strict oversight of my parents. But in spite of our differences, we had been close growing up and I was looking forward to this two week trip to catch up. As the sun slowly rose into the sky I noticed something colorful up ahead. It caught Stacy�s eye too and as we neared it, I realized it was a beach ball. It was just sitting out in the sand, apparently someone had abandoned it. We both moved closer to inspect it and Stacy picked it up. �I wonder if this was carried in by the tide?� she said. She was curious about things like that, in my mind I just thought, �Cool, free ball!� She playfully tossed the ball to me. 

Before I could catch it there was suddenly an explosion of sand all around us, as if a landmine had been buried beneath the ball. Sand flew all around us and I yelled out, startled. Suddenly a scream filled the air. It was Stacy. I couldn�t see her at first through all of the sand in the air but as the cloud of sand started to settle I saw why she had screamed. A dozen giant green tentacles writhed around us, each probably ten or fifteen feet in length and thicker than my arms. The writing tentacles were all around us and I realized they were coming from the sand below us, as if some sort of monstrous octopus or squid was buried beneath our feet. But I knew that whatever this thing was, it was not an octopus or a squid. It was not like something that I had ever heard of, something I was pretty sure even Stacy did not know existed. Stacy screamed again and I looked to see that some of the tentacles had wrapped themselves around her wrists and ankles. They held her limbs immobile and she tried to pull away but seemed unable to. I stood frozen, in complete shock as I watched this scene unfold, and an instant later, tentacles had wrapped around my own arms and legs. The tentacles felt slimy and sticky against my skin and it further reinforced the repulsive, horrible nature of this thing, whatever it was. I tried to pull away but the tentacles were incredibly strong. Stacy began yelling for help and I joined her, but we were pretty far from the resort at this point and I don�t think anyone could hear us. As I watched Stacy struggle, suddenly another tentacle found her. The tip ran down her belly and slowly slipped down the front of her bikini bottom. Her eyes grew wide with horror and she screamed as the writhing tentacle briefly explored her most intimate of areas. Bur then the tentacle suddenly pulled away, tearing away her bikini. I suddenly felt a tentacle run down my neck and back, leaving a slimy sticky substance along my skin. Shrieked and tried to push myself forward but the tentacles around my arms and legs had me firmly secured. The tentacle yanked at my bikini top until it came undone and fell away. It then slid lower down my back and down the back of my bikini bottom. Feeling the slimy thing slide down between my buttocks renewed my panic and I thrashed wildly but it was no use. My bikini bottom was torn away and I was now completely naked. Stacy was also been stripped off her bikini top. Normally I would be humiliated to be stripped naked with my sister on a beach but right now all I felt was panic and fear that this monstrosity, whatever it was, meant to kill me.

In all the chaos, it took me a few moments to realize that I had begun to sink in the sand In fact by the time I realized it, I had sunk down to my knees. The sand around us, which had moments ago been regular sand on a beach suddenly felt almost like quicksand as I found myself sinking rapidly. I realized that the tentacles around my legs were pulling me down, and other tentacles soon wrapped around me to pull me in. Stacy too was being pulled in and she was sobbing hysterically while I screamed as loud as I could, still desperate to draw someone�s attention. We were pulled into this pit of sand quickly and within a few seconds, only our heads stuck out of the pit. I let out one final scream, thinking that I was about to be pulled in and would suffocate. But suddenly tentacle shot down my throat, cutting off my scream, and then I was pulled completely into the sand and everything went dark. Still I felt myself being pulled in further. I realized that I was not suffocating, and apparently the tentacle shoved down my throat was providing me oxygen, like some obscene oxygen machine. I felt myself being pulled down further and further, for perhaps a minute or two,. Suddenly I found myself free of the sand and I was falling through the air. I I fell several feet and hit a dirt floor below me. The fall couldn�t have been more than eight or ten feet but pain shot through my ankle and I laid on the ground, stunned and with the wind knocked out of me. I heard a crash and Stacy tumbled down next to me. I looked around, my eyesight slowly adjusting. I realized that it should be pitch black underground like this but there was a very feint glow inside this strange cavern. I looked around trying to find its source and, more importantly, the thing that had pulled us down. Stacy�s scream suggested she had found it. I spun around to see what monstrous creature had pulled us into this underground prison.
I turned to where Stacy looked with wide terrified eyes and saw what had dragged us underground.&nbsp; Whatever it was, it was not of this world.&nbsp; The creature actually did sort of resemble an octopus, or at least a mutant one.&nbsp; Its body was a round green mass and the dozen tentacles that had grabbed us sprouted from the creature�s body and writhed around in the air.&nbsp; In the center of the creature�s body it had a large opening, surrounded by a red swollen �lip.�&nbsp; Slime or drool or some other substance leaked from the opening, and I got the impression, right or wrong, that this was the creature�s mouth.&nbsp; Other than this mouth and the tentacles, the thing had no discernible features.&nbsp; It had no visible eyes, no nose, and no limbs or other appendages other than the writhing tentacles.&nbsp; The creature�s central mass was large, probably five feet tall and almost as wide and long.&nbsp; My first instinct was that this thing meant to eat me; it looked big enough to swallow up a human and the �mouth� looked big enough that I could fit through it.&nbsp; As big as its mass was, the tentacles did not seem big enough to make the thing very mobile and so Stacy and I ran to the corner furthest from the creature, pressing against the wall, hoping we were out of its reach.&nbsp; The cavern we were in was perhaps fifteen feet by fifteen feet, which did not allow us to put too much space between us and the monster.&nbsp; The creature�s tentacles were long enough that the distance did not matter and several shot forward and grabbed us.&nbsp; Tentacles wrapped around my wrists and began dragging me back toward the creature.&nbsp; I frantically tried to pull away but the creature was incredibly strong, and it was no use.&nbsp; Other tentacles grabbed Stacy and began to drag her towards the creature as well.&nbsp; We both screamed loudly, helpless as we were pulled closer and closer.
Suddenly Stacy�s scream was cut off and instead a horrible whine escaped from her mouth.&nbsp; I had been so focused on my own plight I did not notice what was happening but when her scream cut off, I turned to look at her and stared in horror at what I saw.&nbsp; She was held by the tentacles with her arms above her head, in almost a crouching position, her legs bent and her toes touching the ground but her rear end but a few inches off the ground.&nbsp; Her scream had been cut off because a tentacle had forced itself down her throat.&nbsp; And the whine she made was probably because a pair of tentacles were now thrusting in and out of her vagina and ass.&nbsp; I watched, in shock, unable to comprehend what was happening.&nbsp; Suddenly I found myself pulled down.&nbsp; Tentacles wrapped around my ankles and pulled them up into the air so that my face and arms were pressed to the ground but the rest of my body dangled in the air, helplessly suspended by my ankles.&nbsp; I thrashed around wildly, desperate to free myself, but it was no use.&nbsp; Suddenly my legs were pulled apart wide.&nbsp; I cried out �Nooo!� knowing what was coming and sure enough I felt a tentacle forcing itself into my vagina.&nbsp; It pushed itself in slowly and I squealed as I felt the lips of my vagina stretching beyond belief to take the massive thing in.&nbsp; The tentacle was coated in the slimy substance which allowed it to slide into my tight dry pussy.&nbsp; Still the thing was unbelievably thick and I started to cry out, though more from humiliation and terror than the pain.&nbsp; It forced itself in, deeper and deeper, filling me completely until it pressed up against my cervix.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another slimy tentacle slid between my buttocks and I wailed as it began forcing itself inside my ass.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I had never had anal sex, the thought of it repulsed me, and I screamed, horrified, as the slimy thick tentacle slid between my ass cheeks.&nbsp; I clenched my buttocks, trying to keep it from forcing itself in and tried to pull my rear end away but suspended like I was, I was not able to move much.&nbsp; Suddenly the tentacle forced itself fully in, in one hard motion.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I screamed again, my ass on fire as the brutal invader forced itself in.&nbsp; Like my sister, my scream was cut off as another tentacle forced itself into my mouth.&nbsp; It too was coated with slime, and the taste was revolting, a sour bitter vile taste that made me gag, both from the taste and the fact that it was forcing itself down my throat.&nbsp; Suddenly the tentacles began thrusting, pushing themselves n and out of my moth, pussy, and ass.&nbsp; The tentacles would withdraw halfway and then ram themselves back in, the tentacles fucking all of my holes in a brutal fashion.&nbsp; They slammed into me, again and again and again in a frenzied pace.

I was lost ion my own world of torment and barely noticed Stacy but the slapping sound of flesh against flesh and the wet sounds of slimy tentacles thrusting in and out of her holes, combined with her own whimpers and muffle cries, suggested she was going through the same ordeal.&nbsp; This was worse than being devoured, at least that would have ended quickly, now instead I had become the fuck toy of some vile monstrosity.&nbsp; The assault lasted for what seemed an eternity, the tentacles thrusting in and out of me like pistons, I was so exhausted, I just laid their limp, taking the abuse.&nbsp; The pain was unbearable at first but then something strange happened.&nbsp; I realized in horror I was growing aroused.&nbsp; It started out as a slight tingle in my belly and between my legs but quickly grew .&nbsp; In my mind I was horrified and repulsed at what was happening, but physically my arousal built and built.&nbsp; My nipples and clit began to tingle as well, and grew stiff.&nbsp; I squealed, not in pleasure, but in humiliation, angry that my body was betraying me during this this horrible violation.&nbsp; Suddenly and without warning the orgasm hit me, one so intense I cried out, this time from ecstasy, as wave after wave of pleasure hit me. It didn�t make sense, I had never orgasmed from straight sex, and this should have been anything but pleasurable.&nbsp; But here I was , having the most intense orgasm of my life and even more surprising it kept going and going, not subsiding quickly as an orgasm normally did.&nbsp; It must have lasted a couple minutes, and it made me forget the pain of my brutal violation.&nbsp; In the middle of my own orgasm I suddenly felt a hot liquid spurting from the tentacle into my womb.&nbsp; The one in my ass did not do the same but soon after my mouth was filled with a vile bitter goo that I was forced to swallow.&nbsp; Eventually my orgasm ended and the tentacles finished shooting their goo into me.&nbsp; I was dropped to the ground and the tentacles withdrew from my battered holes with a loud slurping noise. 

I was exhausted and sore and too weak to get up, so I slowly crawled, trying to put distance between myself and the creature, not knowing if it had further plans for me.&nbsp; I looked over and saw that Stacy too had been released from the tentacles� grip.&nbsp; She and I both crawled to the corner of the lair where we collapsed again onto the ground.&nbsp; We were both covered in sweat and panting.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our vaginas and asses were red, chafed, and gaping and a white slimy substance oozed out of our vaginas.&nbsp; Stacy retched and threw up some of the slime that had been forced down her throat.&nbsp; This stuff was green, evidently different from what had been deposited into our wombs.&nbsp;&nbsp; We pressed our backs against the wall and looked at the creature in terror but it seemed to have lost interest in us.&nbsp; In fact, its tentacles had stopped writhing around in the air and all hung limp, draped on the ground.&nbsp; The creature did not move; it appeared to be in some sort of dormant state.&nbsp; I nudged up against Stacy and hugged her, starting to sob.&nbsp; She joined me.&nbsp; Not only had we been through a horrible ideal and experienced the vilest of violations, we both realized we were trapped in some underground lair and had no idea if anyone would ever find us.&nbsp; Nor did we have any idea what this creature had in store for us.&nbsp; We both cried for some time, but I was so exhausted that eventually I dozed off.

I woke up to a loud scream.&nbsp; My eyes shot open and I jumped up, looking around in terror.&nbsp; For a brief moment I had forgotten when had happened to us, but as I saw Stacy, my memory quickly returned.&nbsp; Stacy was no longer next to me.&nbsp; Tentacles had pulled her from our corner and now she was in front of the creature.&nbsp; She was held down, on her hands and knees and tentacles once again pumped in and out of her vagina and ass.&nbsp; Like before, her scream was cut off when another tentacle forced itself down her throat.&nbsp; She stared at me with sad terrified eyes and her gaze met mine as I looked at her, helplessly.&nbsp; Before I could react further, tentacles wrapped around my ankles and dragged me towards the creature.&nbsp; Pinned on my back, within moments tentacles were once again shoved in all of my holes and began pumping away.&nbsp; As before, the assault lasted for a long time and ended with me having an intense orgasm while the creature spewing its cum, or whatever it was, down my throat and into my womb.&nbsp; The creature released us, and we weakly crawled back to our corner and the creature fell dormant.&nbsp; I looked at the cheap sports watch I had worn for our trip to the beach.&nbsp; It was barely past 1 PM.&nbsp; We had been taken a little before 7 AM, meaning barely 6 hours had passed since our first assault.&nbsp; I wandered if this is what I had in store, every few hours,&nbsp; for the foreseeable future.&nbsp; Surely my parents had alerted the authorities.&nbsp; Someone had to be looking for us.&nbsp; We were underground but if someone found the pit, they would eventually find us.&nbsp; They had to!&nbsp; Oh god, they had to!&nbsp; Once again, Stacy and I both cried until we fell unconscious, exhausted from our ordeal.
This treatment continued for several days. The tentacles would ravage us and then release us, leaving us panting and exhausted; then we would retreat to the corner furthest from the monster. Several hours would pass, and the ordeal would start all over. Though I had originally decided the creature was like some mutant octopus I later decided it was more like a mutant sea anemone. It physically resembled an anemone, with its body moth and tentacles. With few features, it seemed like some cross between a plant and an animal. It did not seem to have any consciousness or awareness, let alone intelligence. Its tentacles were its only movement and those only moved when it was seizing and ravaging Stacy and I. Otherwise the thing lied completely dormant. I wondered if the creature actually was some sort of sea anemone that had been undiscovered by humans or if it was some sort of alien from another planet. Though I couldn�t be sure, I decided it was probably the latter. Whatever this thing was, it seemed to prey on humans and if this thing had been on earth all along, surely we would know about it. Or perhaps it was still undiscovered because the only humans that saw it were the poor women who fell into its trap. I decided in the end that it did not matter. The answer to its origins did not make Stacy�s and my nightmare any more or less bearable.
I noticed that strangely, Stacy and I never grew hungry and neither of us ever had to use the bathroom. Whatever goo this creature was forcing down our throats, it apparently kept us nourished and apparently was so efficient nutritiously that none of it went to waste. Even more alarming, our bellies began to swell. At first I thought maybe it was weight gain from the goo. It made sense at first since we never felt even the slightest pangs of hunger. But we were not gaining weight in other parts of our body, only our bellies swelled. It was Stacy who first suggested we were pregnant, whispering the notion into my ear as we huddled in the corner. I shook my head, refusing to believe such a horrible thought but as a couple more days passed our bellies swelled even further, it became quite evident that this was the case. The violation had been bad enough, stripped naked and having tentacles pump in and out of my vagina, ass, and mouth every few hours. I was nourished by what amounted to a cock spurting vile cum down my throat. Each time my own body betrayed me as I experienced intense orgasms with each assault. But now on top of this we had been impregnated with god knows what, by this horrifying creature. Every moment that I was not being ravaged by the creature, I contemplated what could be growing in my belly. The degradation grew even worse as our breasts began to swell. The pregnancy apparently was causing us to lactate, and now, when the tentacles grabbed us to begin their assault, new tentacles now attached themselves to our nipples too and after a hard suction sensation pulled at my nipples and then I could feel milk streaming from my nipples, being pumped away by the tentacles. I realized I was basically cattle, for this animal or creature or alien or whatever it was. I prayed that whatever it was, that I died giving birth, for my life seemed so hopeless, what I was going through so horrible, that I thought death was a better option.&nbsp; 

By day eight, Stacy and I looked nine months pregnant. I was in constant discomfort, and could feel the fetus, whatever it was, moving around in my belly. My lower back ached so much and my breasts were swollen and painful. It got to the point that the assault by the tentacles actually brought some sense of relief. The orgasm it brought made me forget the aching and discomfort for a brief moment and the milking brought relief to my aching swollen breasts.

On day eight, while I lay in the corner next to Stacy, I suddenly felt a sticky liquid running down my thighs. At once I was hit by excruciating cramps and I cried out. Contractions. I was about to give birth to the monstrosity inside me. I wailed in agony and doubled over in pain. I had no idea if this was the normal pain associated with child birth or if this was somehow more intense. Regardless, I knew that a normal mother didn�t have to contemplate what species was growing inside her. Suddenly I felt myself being lifted. The tentacles had me though they seemed gentler than they normally were when they just roughly dragged me over to be ravaged. I found myself placed next to the creature, on my back. Tentacles pulled my thighs wide. I heard a squeal and I looked over as Stacy was being dragged over too. She was not put on her back like me. Rather, she was brought over close to me and forced into a kneeling position on her knees. The creature suddenly lifted my head up and then lowered it into my sister�s lap. Another tentacle grabbed Stacy�s wrist and pulled her hand over to me and placed it on my cheek. She held it there and as I started crying in pain, she squeezed and rubbed my cheek sympathetically. Through my terrible labor pains, I realized in shock that the creature had placed Stacy there to comfort me through my labor. The creature was perhaps not some mindless anemone which only acted on instinct. I realized it was more advanced than we had thought. Then an intensely painful contraction wracked my body and I stopped thinking about the creature. Instinct took over and I suddenly began bearing down, pushing the baby out of me. I felt a sharp searing pain and I screamed in agony. Stacy grabbed my hand and tried to whisper soothing things in my ear but I barely noticed. Suddenly Stacy gasped and I saw her looking down between my legs. Small tentacles had slipped from my vagina and were writhing around, slapping gently against my spread thighs. I turned, unable to look. I of course had not expected a human baby, but to actually look upon this horrible thing being birthed was too much. I kept pushing and finally the thing exiting my birth canal. I sighed and turned back to look to see a mini version of the creature writhing around on the ground. Its daddy picked it up with tentacles and pulled it away from me. Suddenly more searing pain and I started pushing, realizing another one of these things was inside me. I gave birth to four of the things in total before it was finally over. When it was, and I had expelled the placenta, I lied on the ground, covered in sweat, exhausted and so sore. Suddenly I felt something entering my sore vagina and I cried out. The creature was forcing one of its tentacles inside me. It hurt intensely for a moment but then suddenly I felt my womb being coated with goo from the tentacle and immediately all pain down there vanished. The tentacle then withdrew. I lied on the ground resting for some time.

I eventually fell asleep, only to be awoken by cries from Stacy. Awakening I saw her doubled over, clearly in distress. I realized she was now in labor. The creature realized it too, and it Stacy and I were once again put into position, but this time in reverse. I comforted Stacy as she gave birth to her brood. She had five babies. After it was over we were lifted by the tentacles and carried over to our corner. I watched as our nine babies writhed around on the ground next to their father. They seemed much more mobile than the adult version and after maybe after an hour all them suddenly began burrowing into the ground below us and disappeared. That was the last I saw of them. A few hours later we were seized by the tentacles. As I felt a tentacle forcing itself into my vagina, I did not feel any more pain than usual. Apparently I had healed from childbirth. And as an orgasm hit me and I felt the creature�s cum spurting into my belly I realized that the process was starting over. As we frequently did, Stacy and I cried ourselves to sleep.
I woke up to Stacy nudging me. I lifted my head and looked at her and she pointed towards the creature. For the first time since we had been pulled down into the pit, the creature was moving around the cavern. Using its tentacles, it was dragging itself around the lair. Stacy and I watched and after a brief moment it suddenly latched onto the walls with its tentacles and began climbing up until it reached the ceiling which was about twenty feet above us. As we watched it, it suddenly disappeared up a large hole in the center of the ceiling. Suddenly we found ourselves alone in the lair. Stacy and I looked at each other. Stacy stood up first, wincing as she did. I soon followed and also winced in pain. I was sore from the constant fucking by the creature, plus my muscles cramped up easily since we rarely moved around. Stacy ran around the perimeter of the lair, feeling the walls. �We need to find a way out!� she yelled to me. I soon joined her, feeling the walls. We walked in opposite directions along the perimeter until we met in the middle. Neither of us had found anything but solid rock or well packed earth. We started feeling around on the floor. Still nothing. Stacy and I looked at each other. I could see the disappointment on her face. We then looked up at the ceiling. Apparently that hole was our only possible route of escape but there was no way for us to get up there. Suddenly we heard noises coming from the hole and, realizing the creature was probably returning, we both ran back down to our corner. The creature suddenly popped through the hole back into the lair. It was dragging a man. A screaming struggling man. The man was dropped to the floor and he lay there for a moment stunned. Like us, he had apparently been stripped naked. The creature began crawling down the wall, rapidly. The man looked at us for a brief moment, clearly in shock and confused. He thus did not react before the creature pounced on him, grabbing him with its tentacles. The man screamed and started thrashing around but, as we knew, the creature was much stronger than humans. It dragged the man towards it. The creature apparently had a different use for this man. It dragged him towards its mouth-like hole and began shoving him inside. The man was screaming and struggling wildly as the tentacles slowly stuffed him into the mouth. The man went in slowly, head first, and it took perhaps a couple minutes before he had been completely swallowed. I could hear the faintest of muffled noises inside the creature, which I realized were the man�s screams, the sounded dampened by the mass of the creature now enveloping him. Stacy and I sat there watching the creature in shock. The muffled cries and screams from the man lasted perhaps an hour or two, growing fainter and fainter until we could no longer hear them.
Stacy and I sat there and said nothing for some time. Tears flowed down her cheeks and I realized I was crying too. We had just witnessed the death of a man; we had witnessed this thing devouring a human being. And my sister and I were giving birth to more of these horrible things, things that would grow up to capture and impregnate other women and devour men. Stacy and I started whispering to each other. We became determined that we must resist, we must find a way to get away from this terrible creature and end this horrible ordeal. The problem was we had no idea how to resist. There seemed no way to escape the lair. The creature was way stronger than us. And we had nothing down here to use to resist. The only thing in our lair was rocks and Stacy began collecting them. I was not sure how these could be that helpful but I followed suit. Soon we had quite a large pile but the creature gave us no notice. I had no idea if it even sensed what we were doing; it did not have eyes or ears as far as I could tell. As normal, it lay dormant. After we had a large pile, Stacy whispered her plan. We would move the rock pile closer to the creature, to test and see if it did anything in response. If we were able to we would then dump the rocks into its mouth hole. They were indigestible; perhaps the mass off rocks inside it would kill it. I was doubtful about Stacy�s idea but had no better one. And part of me thought, worst case scenario I will be killed if the creature tries to defend itself and that had to be better than being raped and forced to birth more of these monsters over and over again.
The plan seemed to go off without a hitch at first. We slowly transported the rocks closer and closer to the creature and it remained dormant. I was terrified, I had never willingly come close to the creature, but I was determined to go forward with Stacy�s plan. Finally, we had transported all the rocks close to the creature, right in front of its mouth. The pile was almost as tall as me, and any of the rocks were fairly big, a bunch almost the size of my head. Stacy screamed, �Now!� and we started rapidly chucking the rocks into the creature's maw. At first it did not react at all. Then suddenly its tentacles began thrashing around wildly. Some lashed out and tried grabbing at us. I started whipping the rocks at the creature, trying to injure it. But in no time tentacles had wrapped around my wrists and hoisted me up into the air. Stacy was also hoisted up and we both dangled helplessly above the creature. I watched as other tentacles reached into its mouth and began removing the rocks. It tossed them aside. Once it had removed the rocks, Stacy and I were lowered to the ground but the creature did not release us. Instead it held us in a standing position on the ground, tentacles wrapped around my ankles keeping my feet planted firmly on the ground. The tentacles around my wrists held my arms above my head. Stacy was put in the same position. She looked at me in fear. Suddenly another tentacle slicked through the air and struck her across the buttocks. A loud crack filled the cavern as the tentacle hit her flesh. Stacy�s mouth flew wide open and she gasped in shock. The tentacle flew forward again, slicing through the air like a whip and striking her across the other cheek. Stacy�s face contorted in pain and she cried out, her eyes welling up with tears. Another loud crack and it struck her again, then again. I watched in horror as the tentacle struck her over and over, across her thighs and ass. She started to shriek, then scream, and then she just sobbed as she was spanked over and over. She was spanked for a long time, I lost count, but it must have been hundreds of time. Bu the end she just hung limp, sobbing weakly. Finally it was over and the tentacles dropped her. She landed in a pile on the ground. Her whole body was covered in sweat and her entire backside, lower back, and back of her legs were covered in angry crimson and red welts.

Suddenly, I felt an explosion of pain across my own buttocks. I cried out in pain. It was my turn. Again and again, I began to scream in pain, it felt like I was being stung by wasps across my entire backside as the searing pain intensified until I was sobbing and crying but the punishment still did not relent. Finally it ended and I was dropped to the ground. I imagined my own backside looked like Stacy�s, welted, swollen, crimson, and bruised. As I lay on the ground, crying weakly I felt the tentacle grab my wrists. Suddenly the tentacle ripped my watch off. The creature took my watch and tossed it into its mouth.

I realized then this creature was not some dumb animal, it seemed to have incredible intelligence. I had never heard of an animal doling out corporal punishment before. And it had doled out a punishment typical to one inflicted against humans, as if it was familiar with our culture. Then it had taken my watch, leaving me now completely oblivious to what time it was and how many days would pass, leaving us even more in the dark about what was happening. It had to have been intentional on the creature's part. Clearly the creature was purposely punishing us, both physically and psychologically. I pondered this for a few more minutes when suddenly I was hoisted up again by the tentacles. The tentacles began thrusting into my holes, much harder than usual. They began pounding me, much more roughly than they typically did and the cries from Stacy suggested she was getting the same treatment. This lasted much longer than usual and at the end the creature filled my womb and stomach with its cum but for the first time I did not orgasm. Apparently bad girls who attacked the monster did not earn orgasms. It finished and tossed us roughly to the ground.

It had beaten us, literally, but I was not ready to give up. Nor was Stacy. The next time the tentacles reached out to grab us we once again started throwing more rocks at it. We were whipped again and then roughly fucked and sodomized, and as before and were not given an orgasm. The next time neither Stacy or I threw rocks. But as the tentacle forced its way down my throat, I bit down as hard as I could. I felt my teeth sink into the tentacle and almost retched as a sour liquid filled my mouth. The creature stopped fucking my other holes and I felt a tentacle wrap around my throat, tightly. I began to choke and was forced to open my mouth. The tentacle quickly withdrew. I was then brutally pounded in my ass and pussy, again no orgasm. The tentacle did not force itself down my throat. But after it was done with Stacy and I were not released like usual. Instead Stacy was lowered and held down so she was on all fours. I was then lowered to my knees behind her, facing her rear. A tentacle pushed itself in front of my face. I could see the cuts in it from my teeth. The tentacle then lowered and began spurting its goo on Stacy, covering her butt with it. A tentacle pushed me forward and down, towards her butt. I realized in horror what it was trying to make me too. I frantically tried to pull away and turned my head away. But after I did I suddenly heard Stacy gasp. I looked towards her and saw as she stated to buck. I saw that a tentacle had wrapped around her throat and was choking her. My head was again pushed towards her rear. It was very clear to me what the creature�s message was. I had to lick the slime food off my sister's ass or else she would be choked. The creature was showing me that there could be much more humiliating ways to eat my food then the tentacle shoved down my throat which I had ungratefully bitten. I closed my eyes and leaned forward and slowly began licking the goo off her backside. This was it for me. I was done fighting. Being forced to do such a degrading thing, to my own sister no less, had stripped away all of my defiance, all of my fight. It stripped away what little dignity I had left. I didn�t want to fight anymore, I would much prefer to be fucked by tentacles and forced to birth its babes rather than be beaten, abused, and made to degrade myself. I finished cleaning the goo off my sister�s backside and we were both released. We crawled to our corner but did not say anything to each other. We were too humiliated. I wish I had, because Stacy made the same mistake a couple days later. She was forced to lick her goo meal off of my feet.

After this, when the tentacles seized and fucked me I did not even bother to fight. It was no use. But still , the tentacles used me quite roughly and still I was not allowed an orgasm. This continued for some time, as far as I could tell without my watch several days, based on the fact that my belly had started to swell quite large with the latest pregnancy. I found that without the orgasms I grew quite aroused. My thighs were slick with my own juices and my clit was swollen. My loins were hot and my belly tingled. The arousal was so intense it was clearly unnatural and I assumed the effect was something the creature had done to me. I started to miss the orgasms and each time I was fucked and released without one I grew more frustrated, I believed Stacy was getting the same treatment but I did not ask her, it was something way too embarrassing to discuss with one�s sister. The pain from giving birth to the latest brood helped dull the arousal but it quickly returned. Finally, after my belly had swollen up again, I decided to take matters in my own hands. When Stacy was asleep I curled up so my back was to her and slid my hand down between my legs. As I started to rub my clit I was suddenly seized. The tentacles yanked me up into the air. I was lowered so that my feet were on the ground and then swat! The tentacles struck my behind. I cried out in pain. I was spanked for a long time, just as severe as the previous time. Finally I was dropped to the ground. Apparently masturbation was not allowed. Unfortunately the discipline for such an act was not over. Stacy, who had of course awoken to the sounds of my screams, from my spanking was suddenly seized. She was hauled up by her wrists to a standing position. More tentacles pushed me towards her and dropped me on my knees in front of her, holding me in a kneeling position. For a moment I thought I was going to made to lick a goo meal off of her. What the creature had in mind was much much worse. It grabbed me by my neck and pulled me towards my sister�s crotch. I cried out and tried to turn my head but the tentacle held my head straight. It pressed my face right into her pussy. I pulled back. The tentacle pulled harder, placing me so my mouth was just over her pussy. I clamped my mouth shut. Suddenly I heard painful gasps. Looking up, a tentacle was once again choking Stacy. Her face was beginning to turn deep red. I started to cry. �Please don�t make me do this!� I cried. �Please I have learned my lesson! We have learned our lesson!� The creature tightened its grip around Stacy�s throat and pushed me once again towards her crotch. Oh God it couldn�t be making me do this! I realized what was happening. It was stripping away my humanity, degrading and torturing me until I was broken and didn�t fight anymore. I was willing to take horrible punishment. I wasn�t willing to watch my sister die. Crying softly, I opened my mouth and eased it over the Stacy�s pussy. The thought of doing this to any girl was disgusting and this was my sister! Another choking noise from Stacy ended my hesitation. I pushed my tongue forward and begin sliding it up and down lapping at Stacy�s pussy, between the folds. The taste made me want to throw up. Actually the taste itself was gross but not so vile that it made me sick bad but it reinforced what I was doing. I looked up and Stacy was still gasping for air. I leaned in again and increased the tempo, sticking my tongue inside her and licking and slurping and sucking away, then I moved my mouth upwards and begin flicking my tongue across her clit. Her juices coated my tongue, then began to fill my mouth, coat my nose, lips, and even chin. The taste was overpowering, salty yet sweet and I again had to resist the urge to throw up.

Suddenly I felt something poking at my own pussy and then slowly a tentacle slipped in, filling me completely. As I was forced to go down on Stacy, the tentacle began sliding in and out of me. We were both so aroused, so in need of orgasm from our previous denial that neither of us lasted long. Stacy actually came, her juices splattering across my face which caused me to sob in humiliation in between my own orgasmic cries.

The tentacles released us and we both collapsed to the ground. Both of us were crying. Suddenly I was seized again and flipped onto my back. There was a panicked cry from Stacy as she too was seized. The tentacles pushed her forward and down, so that her head was between my legs. �No! Please no!� I wailed, pleading to the monster. It ignored us. Stacy pulled he head away crying out defiantly. In response, the creature wrapped a tentacle around my throat and squeezed. I let out a gasp, trying desperately to breathe. Stacy looked at me with sorrowful eyes and then lowered her head to my pussy. She began licking up and down my slit and my throat was released by the tentacle. I closed my eyes, too humiliated to watch. Her tongue quickly found my clit and the pleasure built up so fast, first a tingling , then throbbing and within a couple minutes another orgasm rocked my body. I was glad it happened so fast. I opened my eyes and Stacy had pulled away, her eyes downcast in shame, her cheeks red, and the area around her mouth glistening with my juices. The tentacles released us again. This time when I crawled away, I went to a different corner from Stacy. I was too humiliated to be near her, to face her, after what we had just been forced to do. She apparently felt the same way and neither of us spoke or even looked at each other. 

I was done fighting. The thing had stripped away all of my dignity and all of my humanity. I began to accept my fate. Like it or not, this creature was going to use me to breed its babies and if I fought it only brought me more pain and humiliation. Moreover, even though I was getting regular orgasms again, I found that my arousal was never dampened for long. By the time the tentacles pulled me over for my fucking I was so aroused that my thighs were slick with my juices. When the tentacles pulled me over, I just hung there limp and closed my eyes, enjoying the orgasms I so yearned and doing my best to not think about the horror or disgusting nature of it.

In between getting fucked I would find myself staring at the creature, waiting for the tell-tale sign that I was going to get fucked again. I knew because right before it yanked me over it would leave its dormant state and its tentacles would start waving around in the air. As I began to yearn more and more for the orgasms, when the creature began waving its tentacles, I would just obediently get up and move over to the creature. When I started doing this, the creature would be much less rough. Rather than drag me roughly it would gently push me down until I was on all fours. Then it would take me. Soon it didn�t even have to do that. As soon as the creature indicated it was ready for mating by waving around its tentacles I would scurry over and get on all fours in front of the creature, my rear up in the air and facing it to be taken.

Stacy refused to give in. She did not actively fight anymore but she refused to accept her fate. The tentacles still had to drag her over and she would struggle. This resulted in her getting treated much more harshly, at least it sounded that way based on her cries and squeals of pain. The creature treated me much differently. My pussy still got pounded by the tentacles but I needed the pounding to dampen my arousal anyway, and it was otherwise gentle. The tentacle that thrust in and out of my ass did so at a much gentler pace, and the one shoved down my throat slipped into my mouth softly and it did shove itself so far down my throat.

Stacy and I barely interacted. Having to sexually pleasure each other had been so humiliating it felt uncomfortable to lie next to each other. I also got the sense Stacy did not approve of me giving in. Eventually I began to feel like she was looking down at me, like I was some kind of slut for giving in. This made me resent her. I was sick of the pain and humiliation, and fighting did us no good. She was the stupid one for continuing her pointless struggles each time the tentacles mated with her. We barely talked or acknowledged each other. The only time we interacted was when we were giving birth and the creature forced us together to aid and comfort each other during labor. I gave birth to brood after brood, soon losing track of time. I didn't think about that, I had given up on caring because time meant little down here. I knew I wasn�t going to be rescued and I stopped thinking about what was happening in the outside world. The only thing I started to think about was when I would get my next orgasm.
As the days or maybe weeks passed I grew to accept me life even more. I not only craved the orgasms, I needed the orgasms. Because the thing I needed so dearly was given to me by the creature, I came to see it very differently. And I began to realize that the best way for me to get orgasms and avoid pain was to accept my place, as inferior to this creature. It utterly dominated me. It controlled every aspect of my life. I ate only when it chose, I fucked only when it chose, I was only allowed the orgasms I desperately craved when it chose. I only remained alive because it allowed me to live. But while I was clearly inferior and at the mercy of the creature, I still served an important purpose. Some humans, like the man that had been dragged down here were nothing but sustenance. I on the other hand was not mere food; rather I was the mother of its brood. My womb helped spawn more and more of these superior beings. I imagined that its brood, our brood, was spreading, slowly subjugating humanity. I no longer saw myself as its prisoner. I was a slave but now a willing one to this higher being that was my Lord. If I behaved like a good slave my Lord treated me well. If I did not, like my sister, I would be abused and punished as she was. That was her choice but I thought it a stupid one. Why fight our Lord? It was pointless. We had learned that the hard way, or at least I had. Stacy maintained her futile defiance.
Stacy's pointless defiance only escalated after the new woman showed up. Just like the time before, our Lord began moving around the lair and suddenly crawled up through the tunnel. I suspected another human prey had wandered up on the beach above and sure enough our Lord came down with a woman, stripped naked. She appeared to be young, perhaps a few years older than Stacy. She screamed in terror until a tentacle forced itself down her throat, cutting off the noise. Soon she was hoisted into the air and was brutally fucked by the Lord. I found myself almost jealous and I crawled over and wiggled my ass seductively in front of the Lord. I was rewarded when I felt a tentacle slide into my pussy and another in my ass and I groaned in pleasure. The Lord then grabbed my sister and dragged her over to be raped. I ignore the muffled whimpers and cries of the new woman and my sister as our Lord took them against their will, and enjoyed myself as I was taken willingly.
When it had finished mating with us the new woman crawled weakly away from the now dormant Lord and towards us. My sister was interested in her. And the woman seemed interested in us. As Stacy and the woman began to talk in hushed voices I gathered her name was Aimee and she was an investigator from the United Nations. Apparently our brood had spread quite quickly and men and women throughout Asia were disappearing. The creatures apparently were quite stealthy and impossible to detect. Their lairs were too far underground to be detected and the creatures seemed to be smart, they seemed to only attack when there were few enough victims that they could take them all. With their lairs so far underground, they were next to impossible to find. Thus, there were few eyewitnesses and getting good intelligence was difficult. The militaries of the world powers were trying to kill them but they couldn't easily find them. They had captured or killed a few and determined them to be of an extraterrestrial origin. But they were spreading much faster than they could be contained. The UN feared that it would soon be beyond containment. 

When Stacy told Aimee who we were, Aimee's eyes widened. When we had gone missing it had been a huge story, in both Thailand and the United States. The authorities assumed we had been abducted, by a human. Only much later, when the disappearances started to increase and the alien infestation had been discovered did anyone draw any connection between our disappearance and the aliens. After that connection was made, we were suspected to be the first disappearance. Thus, Aimee was here because this area was suspected to be ground zero. She was a scientist and had been part of a military unit. The unit had gotten ambushed when they reached this area; the creatures appeared to be highly concentrated here. Aimee's escorts had been killed in the chaos and she had run and now found herself here.
It was then my sister's turn to fill Aimee in with what she knew. Aimee's eyes grew wide with terror as Stacy described what happened to us down here, how we were birthing more of the aliens. "You get used to it, it isn't so bad," I said, finally trying to speak but my sister shot an angry glare at me. She turned back to Aimee. "She� I think she is suffering from Stockholm Syndrome, the� the monster� the alien is cruel �" she tried to explain. I then returned the angry glare.

Aimee had turned quite pale. "How� how many of these things have you given birth to?" Stacy told her she guessed many dozens, maybe hundreds. I interjected again "And now you will join us in giving birth to more of the Lords." But Aimee shook her head. "I� I am infertile" she said softly. Stacy and I looked at each other. We both suspected what that could mean for poor Aimee but neither wanted to give her that news.

"You may end up pregnant anyway," said Stacy. The creature, whatever it injects into us, it doesn't just make us pregnant. We don't get sick, we rarely have to eat, we never use the bathroom, the alien, whatever it is doing to us it has changed our bodies. So perhaps you will find yourself able to get pregnant anyway." Aimee looked more afraid from this development. She apparently did not want to be a mother of our new lords, or perhaps did not understanding that if she did not serve that purpose her only other purpose would be as food.

"Those are not the only changes," I said, glaring again at Stacy. "The Lord will give pleasure beyond your wildest dreams. Soon you will crave it, you will need it!"

Stacy looked at me again, but this time it was a look of pity. This made me resent her even more. "It is how it controls us," Stacy whispered.

Aimee soon experienced all that we had described to her. She joined our routine of getting fucked and forced fed by the tentacles every few hours. Pretty soon Aimee and Stacy had bonded through their mutual pointless resistance and refusal to accept the inevitable. They looked down on me but it was me who deserved to look down on them. When Aimee told us we were the first to be captured, she confirmed what I had already known. We were special. Our Lord was the first and through us his brood was spreading. My children were the new masters of this planet. I imagined the humans who lived in fear of being suddenly pulled down, having no idea what their fate would be. They lived in fear but I was content. I had a higher purpose and for my loyal obedience my Lord gave me greater pleasure than any human could give me. I did not understand why Stacy would not accept this. Aimee was new, perhaps she eventually would. But Stacy's defiance did not make sense. I felt sorry for her.
As the days passed, Stacy's and my bellies swelled. Aimee's did not. We did not speak about it. Neither of us had the heart to tell her what other purpose she might serve. But poor Aimee soon learned. Soon after we had given birth to the latest brood, our Lord apparently grew impatient with his new infertile and thus useless slave. The first sign of her fate came when the Lord fucked Stacy and I but did not touch Aimee. After it finished with us it decided to enjoy a post-coital meal. Aimee was grabbed and the Lord pulled her over to its mouth. As she was shoved inside, Aimee started screaming and Stacy tried to help her, grabbing at Aimee's ankles as her legs flailed helplessly. The Lord effortlessly pulled Stacy away and finished swallowing poor Aimee. Her tortured muffled cries continued for some time, and then faded slowly until finally the noises stopped. It barely affected me. Aimee was barren; she had no purpose other than sustenance for our Lord. That was just the way of things. 

But Stacy snapped after Aimee was ingested. She had a dead look in her eye and she wouldn't speak or look at me. I had hoped that with Aimee gone that my sister would finally accept her new life but she didn't. But when we felt the first pangs of labor and lied down to give birth, she finally paid attention to me again. I cradled Stacy's head as she gave birth. Trying to comfort her as she sobbed though I suspected it was not the pain of labor so much as her inability to accept what was happening. Then she was done and I was ready and as always she cradled my head and comforted me as I gave birth. But then after the first of my babies slipped out of my wombs she suddenly jumped up. Grabbing a rock with both hands and lunged forward. I screamed as she swung both arms down, aiming the rock at the newborn creature, attempting to smash it. Our Lord seized her wrists and stopped her a split second before the rock crushed my baby. It hauled her up in the air its tentacles waving wildly. It had all happened so quickly I had no time to react to any of it. Stacy was hoisted in the air and the Lord pulled her limps stretching her out until she was crying. Tentacles thrust into her pussy, ass, and mouth, thrusting harder than I had ever seen the Lord do before. The fact that she had just given birth must have made it even more painful. Soon Stacy was bouncing around squealing in pain through the tentacle shoved down her throat as she was brutally fucked. I felt labor pains and had to look away and concentrate on the task at hand, birthing more of our brood and ignoring my sister's brutal punishment. After I was done giving birth I lied on the ground, exhausted and covered in sweat. Still the Lord did not relent on Stacy. She hung limply in the tentacle's grip as she was pounded. It went on and on and on. I had no way of keeping track of time but it seemed like hours. Finally the tentacles withdrew from her battered swollen holes but her punishment was not over. The Lord then lowered her but still held her up by her wrists and began to brutally whip her. Exhausted from labor I fell asleep to the sounds of the tentacles striking Stacy's flesh and the hoarse cries that escaped her throat.

When I woke up I heard the slapping sounds not of whipping but of Stacy being fucked. It was just as brutal as before. I wondered if the punishment had at all relented during my slumber. I watched her being brutally fucked. I did not feel sympathy. She had tried to kill one of the Lord's babies, MY baby. She was lucky she was not killed, or perhaps she still would be. Stacy was again lowered and again hung by her wrists. I thought she was to be whipped again but instead the Lord gently pushed me towards her. When I reached my sister the Lord pulled her down, holding her ankles to the ground but bending her at the waist until she was bent over. The Lord grabbed my wrist and pulled my hand over and made me strike my sister's backside, which now stuck up in the air. It then released my wrist but I understood what I was to do. Crying out angrily I swung my hand down again, striking her ass with my open palm and leaving a red handprint on her right ass cheek. I struck her again on the other cheek. Screaming in anger I struck her again and again as hard as I could. I ignored her weak sobs and spanked her over and over until her ass turned bright red and then purple and blue from the welts I was creating. I hit her so many times I lost count and lost track of time until finally the Lord pulled me away. She was hoisted up in the air again and brutally fucked. It seemed that Stacy's punishment was never-ending. These cycles continued for an eternity. She was fucked, whipped by the Lord, fucked, and spanked by me, before the cycle repeated. When I was not helping with the punishment I was fucked gently by my Lord until I cummed, I was fed, and I was allowed to sleep.

It must have been a couple of days that this continued but I couldn't be sure. Finally, our Lord decided Stacy would be allowed some rest. The Lord nudged me and I submissively lowered myself. The Lord pushed me until I was on my back. It nudged my legs with its tentacles and I obediently spread them. I was disappointed when the Lord did not begin to fuck me but instead sprayed some of its goo onto my crotch. Stacy was dragged over, barely conscious. It pushed her face in between my legs and she hungrily licked up the goo. Apparently she had not been fed or fed very little during her punishment and her hunger trumped her dignity. She quickly licked the area clean but feeling her tongue against the soft folds of my pussy had me quite aroused. Perhaps my Lord sensed this and so when Stacy tried to lift her head away it roughly pushed her had forward again. Stacy hesitated for a moment but then buried her face in my crotch and began licking my slit up and down and then teasing my slit. I came quickly but the Lord kept pushing Stacy's head forward and she continued pleasuring me with her tongue. Another orgasm. Then another and another. Stacy was made to eat me out for some time and I came over and over again. Finally the Lord decided she was done. It pulled her up and hoisted her up in the air. The brutal fucking resumed and then after he was spent he brought her down to be spanked again by me. The cycle of punishment continued for some time, with the only breaks for Stacy to lick her meal off my pussy and then thank me by orally pleasing me for some time.
I saw what my Lord was doing. He was breaking her. She would feel nothing but pain and humiliation until she gave in. Being forced to perform orally on her own sister would strip away what remaining dignity she had. I was not at all ashamed or disgusted by it. I was an animal that lived only to serve my Lord. To be obedient and to receive orgasms in return was my only purpose. If it was by his will that it be my sister's tongue than his tentacles then so be it. And hopefully Stacy was beginning to understand.

I began to feel some sympathy for her. She deserved to be killed for her heinous act of trying to kill my baby but this was worse than death. But finally, after what must have been many many days, the Lord finally dropped her to the ground. He nudged me over to her. She was lying on the ground limp and covered in sweat, her whole body swollen and covered in bruises. I cradled her head and hugged her, crying. It seemed her punishment was over and she was allowed to rest. The Lord sprayed her with the goo every few hours, including inside her ass and pussy and this seemed to make her recover quickly.
During this period, the Lord was preoccupied with tending to Stacy's recovery which unfortunately meant that he was not spending time fucking me. Thus I grew more and more aroused and craved an orgasm more and more. Finally, the Lord began to wave his tentacles around to signify that it was mating time. I quickly stumbled over and got on all fours with my rear raised in the direction of the Lord. But as I waited, I watched astonished as Stacy weakly crawled over and got in the same position as me. Tentacles slid into her ass, pussy and mouth along with mine and we both moaned in pleasure. I cried out in orgasm and also joy. My sister had finally accepted her fate.

This continued for a few cycles. Each time the Lord was ready we both willingly got into position. However, something else was definitely not right. Stacy's belly seemed to be swelling and mine wasn't. I assumed maybe this batch inside me was developing slowly. But then the Lord did something it had never done before. It pulled Stacy over but not me and it gently placed the largest of its tentacles across the top of her head. Stacy slumped forward slightly and then remained frozen in place. She remained in that position for several minutes, like she was in a trance, and the Lord did not move at all except for the single tentacle it placed on her head which seemed to quiver slightly. Then suddenly it pulled away and Stacy sat up straight. She smiled to the Lord and then quickly averted her gaze, in submission. She turned around and returned to me. There were tears in her eyes but she was smiling. She hugged me and held me for a moment and then withdrew. "What is it?" I asked, confused.

"Our Lord, he spoke to me. He told me many good things."

My eyes widened. Why had he spoken to her and not me? I had been loyal for so much longer. "He spoke to you? What did he say?" I said, trying to hide the jealousy I was feeling.
"The lords' settlement of our planet is going well. The lords have many thousands of women in Asia breeding. And now the next phase has begun. Lords are now landing in the other continents to begin new colonies. Soon all of Earth will have underground chambers like this with women to bring forth more of our Lords. But we started this, sis. We have much to be proud of."
I smiled and nodded my head. Stacy continued. "The Lord says the next phase of the settlement is beginning. We have done a very good job of breeding as many Lords as possible but now, well the focus has changed. They have plenty of Lords in our area and now the focus must be on ensuring that those that are born come from the best stock of women. Our babies, they inherit some of our genetics and the Lords want their offspring to come from the strongest, healthiest, and smartest of our females." I nodded again. "The Lord is very thankful for the babies you have given him, sis," said Stacy. Her eyes teared up more and she gave me a sad smile. "But the Lord recognizes that I am the smarter one and thus I am better suited to bring forward the next generations of our lords."

I looked at her confused. What was she saying? "I have been an obedient slave and had served the Master well!" I cried angrily.

"You have," said Stacy as she hugged me again. "And you shall still serve our Lord." Suddenly tentacles seized me. Stacy held my hand. "Bye sis," she said as she smiled to me, tears falling down her cheeks. "I shall make sure that our Lord is served well." Suddenly the Lord yanked me away. It was so fast I had no time to react but as I turned I realized in horror I was being dragged towards the Lord's mouth. As I was pushed in feet first, I let out a sorrowful wail. How could he eat me? I had served him so well! I was not as smart as my sister but I was not stupid. And I was loyal. She had tried to kill one of our babies. Was loyalty not important would that trait not serve well in our Lord's offspring? I was swallowed slowly and I thrashed around desperately but it was no use.

"Please my Lord!" I wailed. "I want to give you more babies, please don't eat me!" My Lord ignored me. Soon I had been swallowed up to my waist. I tilted my head back and looked at Stacy. She was no longer paying attention to me. Instead she was on all fours with her ass in the air moaning as the Lord was fucking her with his tentacles. I let out another sorrowful wail. How could this be happening? My pleading continued as I was forced further and further inside. But my Lord still ignored me. I let out one more wail before he pushed my head inside and I was swallowed completely.

I felt myself being pushed down further and further until I found myself in writhing around in a fleshy pocket of space that was not much bigger than me. As I writhed around the pouch stretched somewhat but it held me in tight. Suddenly I felt a liquid dripping on me. It began to burn intensely. I screamed in pain and began writhe around in agony. The searing pain spread across my whole body and as I screamed the burning pain filled my mouth then throat and lungs. This couldn't be happening! I was not food! I was a mother! Why did he choose Stacy over me! Then as the burning agony increased all rational thoughts stopped. I screamed and screamed as I writhed around in pain until I grew weak and lied limp and my screams turned to whimpers. The pain subsided as I went into shock. Then, mercifully, everything went black.




EPILOGUE

Laura Stewart ran and ran. Her legs burned and she was out of breath but she had nowhere to go. She had been in Manhattan. Her family had fled there soon after more and more of the aliens had landed in the United States. The government had advised people to remain in cities and places where the land was paved over with asphalt or cement. It was in the rural and suburban areas with the soft ground that humans were most vulnerable. Particularly women or girls who had reached puberty. Even the cities were growing less safe, reports were that women and sometimes men were being dragged down subway tunnels and sewers. Still, the US military was better at tracking down and killing the aliens in the city where they could not bury themselves as easily. But then the new meteors had started falling. These were not like the ones that seemed to deliver the aliens. These ones seemed to be designed like missiles and were striking military and government installations, causing massive explosions and fires. More meteors began hitting the big cities. New York City was now an inferno from these meteor strikes. People were now fleeing the city in a panic. Laura realized this must have been the aliens' intent to drive humans from the cities so they would be easier prey. But they had no choice, it was flee or burn up in the raging fires. Laura had gotten separated from her family as she had fled across the bridge out of Manhattan on foot. In the stampede of panicking people she had been driven forward, and she watched in horror as people who fell were trampled. Now she was in a wooded area and separated from the stampede. She knew the risks but it was a better option than getting trampled to death. That was certain death and she only had a small chance of walking over one of the traps and getting seized by an alien. But each step was torture as she anticipated being taken. Perhaps being trampled would have been better. To be pulled down and constantly raped and impregnated, to be forced to give birth to more these things was a fate much worse than death. Perhaps she could fund a smaller city or town. That would be safer. 

As she continued walking suddenly there was an explosion of dirt all around her. She let out a scream as suddenly tentacles writhed all around her. She turned and tried to run but was seized before she could. She thrashed around wildly as the tentacles tore off her shoes and socks and ripped her shirt and jeans from her body. Her panties and bra soon followed and she wailed as she suddenly found herself being pulled into a pit. As she dropped into an underground put and felt a tentacle force itself into her pussy, ass, and mouth she decided she would have much preferred to have been trampled to death in the stampede out of New York.
