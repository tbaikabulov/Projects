When Predator Becomes Prey

Synopsis: A chauvanistic slaver discovers what he believes to be the catch of his life, but instead turns out to be its downfall.






Authors Note: The following is just a piece of entertaining (Hopefully) fiction, nothing more. The author condemns real life slavery and rape and hopes that those willingly participating and profiting from such crimes are brought to justice: yet this piece differs in that it is fantasy, nothing more. 

****

To me, the female body was a thing of beauty: a perfectly sculptured master piece there for admiration and the visual delight of others. Trim, well shaped and with pleasing features surpassing that of the greatest works of art in history, a good woman&#8217;s body to me was worth a pot of gold. Sometimes literally. Perhaps it was my fascination and veneration of female beauty, or the way I could make them do whatever I wanted when I had them within my grasp, but for as long as I could remember, I have always enjoyed the thought of making my living with artwork. Female artwork that is. 

While the fantasies had started at a much younger age, I entered into my trafficking business roughly when I was out of school, around the age of 18. At first, I started off as a scout: prying through the various nightclubs of my city on the look out for pretty, seemingly alone girls. As the years passed however, I was given more and more responsibilities, eventually coming to the top of my profitable�corporation that trafficked artwork to those depraved and wealthy enough to become one of my clients. At this point, women for me had become little more than walking wads of cash. Although indeed there were women amongst my organization that did the same to men, I found my ability to connect with them on a human level diminishing with the growing numbers of women I sold into slavery, as even female &#8216;work mates&#8217; took on the appearance of potential slaves, at least in my mind.

All of this however, is history. I used to think of women as a source of income for myself and fellow males, now I sternly believe the opposite, after all don&#8217;t they say that behind every great man is an even greater woman? Like many, many other stories of present and past, it started with a girl. Still, the most gorgeous creature I have ever laid eyes upon. 

A year and a half ago, almost to the day, I had been amongst one of the privileged few invited to attend the opening of a new art gallery dedicated to the establishment of human rights (The irony was delicious) in war torn countries. I was a friend of the owner after some of my girl&#8217;s sold her a pair of high school football quarter backs she now keeps chained up in her basement, and she had wished to thank me in a way by inviting both I and the relevant associates to a congregation that offered me the opportunity to mingle with the cities High Society, and possibly more customers.&nbsp; It was when I was discussing a piece of art drawn by some wanna-be artist college girl that I laid eyes upon &#8216;Her&#8217;. Although my glance just passed her briefly when I was casually scanning the room, my roaming vision was quickly drawn back to her when my brain registered the possible angel fallen from heaven. Her height was nice for a woman, 5&#8217;10 with firm yet feminine shoulders. The hair that crowned her head seemed to me to be made from black silk, falling down to the top of her lower back like a straight ebony waterfall: such a fine mane was complimented by beautiful olive hued skin, the likes of which seemed utterly flawless. Her face was no different, a set of full, dark colored lips set amongst her elegant features: lips that, to me at least, seemed designed for the sole purpose of pleasuring a man&#8217;s most intimate places. Even her eyes caught my attention from such a distance, lovely, large dark brown eyes that contrasted beautifully with the rest of her trim being. The type of eyes a man could stare into and lose his place of time for hours on end, utter pools of fascination. Judging from first impressions, I estimated that she did enough exercise to remain healthy and maintain her weight, so while she was not an athletic girl she was still well-figured. Due to my limited vocabulary, I have found that to describe her fully in a method that did her appearance justice is a task simply beyond my capabilities. Judging from the way she looked, I could tell that she was from the Mediterranean area, the birthplace of many fine looking females indeed. To my reasoning, I knew a creature of such splendor belonged with a collar and leash around her neck as to allow her to be tied to a man&#8217;s bed. 

The woman I was currently talking with was a bore: an elderly woman with the appearance of a cultured bush pig trying to pass off as marginally intelligent. In the middle of one of her many meaningless sentences about topics I didn&#8217;t give two rat&#8217;s arse&#8217;s about, I simply left her in search of what I hoped to be the trophy catch of my career. Getting to her was no easy task, as I wasn&#8217;t the only male in the room using my dick as a compass, as I irritably had to wait a few moments for the female to whisk aside the first set of potential suitors. Much to my delight, the first batch seemed to consist of all the &#8216;pretty boys&#8217; amongst this congregation&#8217;s male population. A good sign that she went for someone a bit deeper than the appealing visage of the face, unfortunately for her I wasn&#8217;t the same. Standing within her presence - her elegant, trim frame so close that I could have reached out and slapped her shapely arse -&nbsp; I smiled gently to her as I tipped my wine glass forward slightly in a sigh of respect. 

Much to my delight, she smiled back, if only lightly. 

�May I?� I gestured forward with the bottle of Champaign I had picked up on the way over upon noticing her empty goblet: I was rewarded with a small nod and the delight of pouring another glass of Frances finest for her.

�I have not seen you within the city before, generally I am privy to the arrival of all the charming young ladies such as yourself, you must have slipped under the radar somehow��

A small compliment, a tad sleazy with a pinch of cockiness: a concoction many young women had taken a liking to in the past, much for their apparent misfortune and re-location later. 

The good signs continued as she offered a light smile, arching her lovely lips then parting them to speak with a voice that sounded as if it had been spoken by the throat of the worlds finest singer. 

�Thank you, I have only been here for a few months, I am currently staying with family�

Italian. 

Linguistics may not have been my strongest point, and though she spoke fluent and easily understandable English, I could definitely detect the touch of an Italian accent.&nbsp; I remember encountering one Italian woman before in the past, and I had had the pleasure of hearing her moan and speak with the beautiful accent the Italian women are gifted with. An even better turn of events that I shall get to encounter another.

�Johnethan Anderson� I stated with another small, warm smile, extending my hand.

To my surprise, she grasped my hand with a firmness I would not expect from her elegant frame. The first of her many deceptions. Yet I also could not help but notice the softness of her skin, and the creative thoughts of were else the use of such lovely fingers could be applied. 

�Andrea Osirio, pleased to meet you� she replied, her dark, enchanting eyes shimmering like obsidian in candlelight. 

While I should have registered the instant warning, I did not. Thinking back to my one chance to avoid future downfall, I can think of nothing but what a fool I was to ignore the first and only cautionary signal I was to receive, as well as cursing the one true moment my memory needed to work, yet didn&#8217;t. Osirio was a name that I should have recalled in an instant. 

�What a lovely name�� I said, keeping the air of warmth about me as best I could �...from the sounds of it I would say you are from, Italy?�

Andrea nodded, those lovely dark eyes hiding behind them the creatively sinister mind I would learn to fear. 

�My family is from Sicily, and I have come over here in the hope of finding employment�

So she was a potentially working class girl. The darker corner of my mind &#8211; that is the majority of it &#8211; mused that I could give her life long employment if she so wished. 

�What field are you seeking work in?�

�Biochemistry, I finished my degree last year. My parents allowed me to stay with them for a year of relaxation, before I came here to seek rewarding employment�

Stunning and brainy: by default I considered all females inferior to males, and while this delicious piece of meat was no exception, I could tell that her company for the night was at least going to include an intelligent conversation. The least could be said about the other, less subtle gold diggers hanging around the bar like vultures. 

I put on an impressed face, part of which was genuine. In return I received what I could tell was a favorable glint in her eyes from seeing it in the orbs of so many other women her age in the past. I could have flashed a toothy grinned right there and then: she was a posh slut. My favorite type of woman to sell. 

After years of practice at wooing women &#8211; younger women like her especially &#8211; I had learned the various different approaches a man could take to gain access to ski the pink slope, and this Italian beauty was no exception. 3 hours later, Andrea and I burst into one of the women&#8217;s cubicles in the rest rooms, locking the door behind us as she feverously worked on the removal of my pants. 

I did nothing but stroke that lovely hair of hers, its touch akin to the softest materials man could make, while the young Italian pushed me down onto the toilet behind me, my pants and boxers around my ankles. Before my semi-hard prick could register the sensation, Andrea already had my dick in hand, her elegant fingers wrapped around the thickening meat shaft and stroking up and down with seemingly expert skill. I could feel my heart beat racing, as was the welcome side effect of adrenaline when a man was about to get his prick sucked by A grade meat. 

�You get this sucked often?� She spoke, her accent furthering my erections enthusiasm. Even now I watched as her stroking hand was dwarfed by my peckers 10 erect length. 

Through a soft moan I nodded, a �Never enough though� added in to spark up a smile across those heavenly lips, her naughty smirk indicating my success. In truth, I had lost count of the amount of young women I had fed to the monster between my legs: hundreds, possibly thousands. I had the privilege and pleasure of screwing each and every female slave that was sold to domestic or over sea&#8217;s buyers, a precaution that I liked to take for &#8216;Quality Reasons&#8217;. 

Andrea&#8217;s smirk remained as her pumping hand came to a stop, clasped around my knob as she dived her beautiful face in nice and low to press her lips against the bottom of my shaft where she began to kiss upwards. Just as I had imagined, those gorgeous chops of hers excelled when utilized for dick sucking purposes, and the tingling sensation that ran through my cock when she kissed the knob of my prick was second to none. 

The Italian continued, kissing around the rim of my German helmet before I saw her tongue slide gracefully out from behind her lips and repeat the process of licking the rim with the tip of her tongue. Such a tantalizing tease echoed twice fold as I soon felt her lash the tip of my cock with her experienced tongue. I could easily tell that this little whore was a tease of the nicest order, as I could only watch with enthrallment as those succulent lips inched closer and closer to wrapping themselves around any part of my fully erect member. Taking her mouth down to the base of my penis, I closed my eyes amidst the growing pleasure, feeling the fullness of her tongue press against my dicks base and lick straight upwards until it came to the head. My prays were finally answered, when she kept her tongue pressed against the sensitive flesh and took it into her hungry, wet mouth, the sneak peek I took causing my balls to tingle as I spied how beautiful her lips looked wrapped tight around a thick cock. 

Pushing her head down, Andrea greedily took more and more inches into her hungry maw, finally stopping when I felt the head of my dick press against the back of her tight throat. However it didn&#8217;t last for long, as she moved her head back up, sucking firmly with the skill of a porn star while her tongue danced beautiful patterns across the shaft of my cock. She continued, bobbing her stunning head up and down on my dick, the wet sloppy sounds her mouth made as she sucked and slurped like a pro&#8217; serving as music to my ears. 

Andrea stopped sucking suddenly, took my dick out of my mouth and spat on it: a nice large gob of woman-spit splattered across the already gleaming cock. At this point I thought she was about to turn around and join the countless number of girls that had given themselves to my one eyed monster, but she didn&#8217;t. Grabbing my length, she pumped her hand up and down, splashing wet spit and mouth-juice around my balls, cock shaft and her hand, creating a nice large wet mess that she was going to clean up with her lovely mouth. Instead, I watched with at first confusion, then delight as she continued pumping my cock with her hand, only to dive her face lower. Moments later, I felt those stunning lips press against my asshole, and shortly after a few blissful moments of sucking, I felt her tongue follow suit. 

Still holding a handful of her hair, I noticed that my spit saturated dick and balls pressed against her beautiful face as she sucked and licked my arse. As she moved her face from side to side with her skillful sucking and licking, I watched my balls smear her own spit over her face like a wet paintbrush in such a demeaning way that I knew this beautiful whores destiny was as someone&#8217;s fuck toy. If I had thought the wet slurping noises had been loud before when she was sucking meat, obviously I had been wrong: I was surprised people out in the foyer didn&#8217;t hear this little slut-pig slurp like a half-submerged fuel pump.&nbsp; 

Pulling her head back with my hold on her hair, and her lips away from my arsehole, I watched her shocked face stare back at me in surprise, probably wondering if she had done something wrong. Quite the contraire, she was shaping up to be part of my A grade kennels. 

I ended her surprise with a slap across the face with my dick: the wet sound mimicking a wet fish slapping the pavement. In her eyes however, I could still see shock: obviously no one had ever done this to her before. No one would have dared insult such a beautiful creature, lest she stop the sinful pleasure she was visiting upon them. &#8216;Get used to it slut�&#8217; I thought coldly with another slap to her stunning face, then another, and another. Each slap splashed more spit over her lovely olive features, her beautiful face glistening now with the saliva from her own mouth after it had been smeared across my dick. Pulling her head back so that she could only look up at the ceiling &#8211; if she still had her eyes open, which she didn&#8217;t, thanks to some stray splashes of spit &#8211; I ran my slippery cock along the natural chasm created by her now vertical lips. Still holding the base of my dick, I slapped her lips with my dick once, twice, and a third time, watching after each slap as she attempted to wrap her lips around my shaft. 

�Beg for it�� I commanded, utilizing my position over females as a member of the male gender. 

�P, p, Please, let me��

�You call that begging? I said beg, not ask you little slut��

I followed the semi-threat with another Turkish Slap, this time my knob landing right on her closed right eye, causing her to wince. 

�P, Please, please let me suck on your cock sir! I need to suck on it so &#8211; �

I cut off her pathetic attempt at begging by shoving the shaft into her mouth, causing her to gulp deep enough that for a moment I thought I could turn her around and see my dick coming out the other side of her neck. 

Using my hold on her head via her hair which I held like a pair of handle bar&#8217;s, I pulled her down hard onto my cock, the head hitting the back of her throat before I pulled her up again, only to repeat the process. I watched the power of cock work its way through her mouth and throat: at times choking her, other times letting her breathe, but all the time pleasuring me. I listened to her choking and almost gagging, taking great pleasure in her willingness to humiliate and demean herself so I could cum. A definite slave. 

5 minutes of this passed. 5 minutes of her constant choking, coughing, spluttering, near-gagging and slurping over my dick, and it wasn&#8217;t much longer after this that I felt my balls tighten in anticipation of spreading my seed onto yet another female. 

Getting her on her knee&#8217;s as &#8216;normal&#8217; before, I held her hair roughly while she pulled me off aggressively, as if trying to pull the cum out of my balls in the fastest time possible. 

�Do you want to suck it again whore?� I asked coldly upon the brink of my cumming.

The slave dealer inside me grinned as she nodded frantically, her large brown eyes wide with anticipation.

�Oh yes, yes please� was her spluttered response as I pulled out a card and slid it into the cleavage created by the pair of luscious, firm mounds on her chest: just like a credit card swiping during the purchase of a product. 

�Turn around�� I said amidst a controlled gasp on my behalf.

She hurriedly obeyed, turning around and facing the cubical door as I stood just behind her, roughly pulling my cock. 

It was only when I blew my heavy load that she realized where it was going, and by then it was to late. 

�Noo!!� Andrea shrieked, trying to pull away in the nick of time. She might have as well, if I hadn&#8217;t of been holding her in place for my massive load to splatter all over her beautiful hair. 

�No�.no�� The Italian beauty whimpered helplessly, a few tears rolling down her cheeks as I shot my last few white, sticky jets across her silky raven colored hair.&nbsp; 

Turning her around, her face still contorted by her whimpering and the beginnings of weeping &#8211; I probably would have to if I had was a female and just received what she had &#8211; I mercilessly shoved my long, meaty pecker down her throat again. It needed to be clean before I put my pants back on, and her mouth and throat were the perfect tools for the job. 

I was not as gentle as I was before, as I full on deep throated the broken posh slut, my balls slapping against her wet chin. I got all my 10� down the bitches throat, and I held her there, waiting. It was only moments later that I noticed Andrea&#8217;s chest starting to convulse at around the same time her throat began to seriously constrict around my cock like a firmly squeezing hand. Knowing these signs, I only pushed harder, pressing her nose into the thick curls of pubes above my dick.

Pulling out at the last moment, Andrea&#8217;s fingers rushed up to her spit stained lips as she desperately threw herself towards the toilet. Naturally I was no longer watching, my job was done and I had just finished pulling my pants back up and fastening my belt when the sounds of violent gagging came to my ears. With my back turned to Andrea, a smirk crossed my face: another posh slut broken and taught a lesson in which gender was superior. 

�Call me, my numbers on the card� I said calmly, fully confident from her eagerness previously that she was going to call. If not, well, I could always track the whore down. 

I left the rest rooms then: leaving behind me Andrea, her head in the toilet gagging from the deep throat she had just received, half of her beautiful long silky black hair covered with sticky warm cum, tears rolling down her face from her humiliation, her mascara smeared and running, and her stunning face saturated with her own cock-soaked spit. 

Had Andrea been any other girl, I would have gone home, pulled off over the image then tracked her down and done it to her all over again before selling her to the highest bidder in Eastern Russia. 

Unfortunately for me though, I had had my fun: coming soon was her&#8217;s. I just didn&#8217;t know it yet.

My business specialised in enslaving,
training and selling females as sex slaves to men, plain and simple. There was
a branch that dealt with the opposite, with women slavers kidnapping and
training males as sex slaves and selling them to other rich women or wealthy
homosexual men. Sometimes I had found out that they occasionally sold a man to
a group of heterosexual men, who just used him for a snuff video or hunted him
in the forest, or some other venture like that. However as much as I hated to
admit it, this particular branch � of which I despised � was growing quite
rapidly. Rapid enough that at one point in my life I faced the possible women
take over of my business. Now, I could not simply fire them all, shut down the
division and be done with it. No, that would lead to unpleasant consequences.
Whilst at the time I hated women, I still did believe in the saying Thou hath
no fury like a woman scorned, and many clients of this female dominated
division of my business where not only wealthy women, but powerful and
influential ones to; to bring about their wrath at the sudden severing of their
supply of male slaves would be invite to disaster. So to ensure my side of the
company stayed ahead in the profits race, I opened up a secret new section;
submissive training. The operation was quite simple,
men with feisty partners would pay me to ensure their �significant� others were
taken down a notch in their defiance. A great many notches.


&nbsp;

I was enjoying one such session when the
phone rang. A wife, only in her mid thirties, was forcing herself not to stream
tears as the crocodile clips on her nipples fed her luscious breasts a steady
supply of electricity. I was sipping a cup of coffee, enjoying the show, when
the phone rang and soon appeared in front of me, carried by an aide, his eyes
focused on the exercise to weaken a womans will.
Taking the device, I held it to my ear, blocking out the gagged screams of the
woman as I calmly spoke.

&nbsp;

�Speak�

&nbsp;

�Hello?�

&nbsp;

My heart skipped a beat, a glimmer
slithered over my eyes and my nuts tightened at the sound of the voice I had
been dreaming to hear from for what seemed like the beginning of my life. It
was Andrea.

&nbsp;

�Andrea�� I answered calmly, pausing to
take a slip of coffee. 

&nbsp;

�Sorry, that it took a couple of days to
call, I wasn�t sure if I should�

&nbsp;

�Don�t worry, you made the right decision�
I soothed, the surface of my eyes glimmering from the female light show before
me. 

&nbsp;

�I had fun the other night� I continued
quickly, wanting to remind her of the demeaning humiliation I put her through. 

&nbsp;

�In fact, I had so much fun,
I was hoping we could meet up again some time�

&nbsp;

This was a hatred of mine when it came to
women: their submission, coupled with the fact they liked to be treated like shit. Afterwards they turn around and
state their perfect guy would treat them right and respect them. The first half
of my dislike followed.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

�Um, sure� Andrea sounded hesitant. Good, I
mused silently at her hesitation and what it symbolised, showing some
self-respect. 

&nbsp;

�Great, it was nice to hear from you again.
I hope I wasn�t too hard�

&nbsp;

�No, not at all� Andrea�s lyrical voice
gained something resembling the confidence it first had when we met, before I
broke her.

&nbsp;

�Im free this
Friday if you wish to meet up again� I charmed, trying to add an edge of
gentleness to my voice. 

&nbsp;

�How�how, about tonight?�

&nbsp;

Had my ears deceived me? She was that eager to be used as my personal cum
rag again so quickly? I still could not believe my luck at the stunning whore I
had brought out within her, truly, I would be laughing
all the way to the bank when I cashed the check warranted by her sale. 

&nbsp;

�Am�am I catching you at a bad time?� 

&nbsp;

The electrocuted wife, she was too loud. 

&nbsp;

A corner of my lips raised slightly in a
small sneer: stupid inconsiderate bitch. No matter, you did not enter this
business without having some sort of wit to take you above mere scout.

&nbsp;

�Not at all my dear, just
at home watching a movie. You know how they are
these days, all action and no plot.

&nbsp;

Andrea chuckled slightly, her heavenly
voice rising a sensation in my dick akin to the
nearing of a climax.

&nbsp;

�Definitely, Id be delighted to meet
tonight, what is the occasion?� 

&nbsp;

�I have a family function tonight and I
don�t have a date�

&nbsp;

A quick glance to my wrist watch revealed
that it was rather late in the evening for the beginning of a family function.
Once again, reflecting on the last few free days of my life, I cannot fathom
how the clear as day clues did not jump up and slap me in the face to wake me
up to the obvious. The only thing on my mind at that time was meeting her again
and breaking her again

&nbsp;

�Why not?�

&nbsp;

�Great!� Ms.Osirio
sounded genuinely delighted. 

&nbsp;

�Pick me up in an hour at 107 Northreich Street�

&nbsp;

My response was cut short by dial tone, as
she swiftly hung up. 

&nbsp;

oOo

&nbsp;

Picking up Andrea had proved uneventful. I
had arrived at her house, the lustrous manor impressing me greatly, only to be
greeted at the door by the incarnation of beauty herself, the night moon
glimmering of her silky ebon mane. A mane, I mused to myself, that I had
painted with a scrotum load of cum. It was amazing that the bitch had managed
to clean her hair so thoroughly in three days. She wore a glittering dress that
highlighted all her beautiful curves and left nothing to the imagination,
except the mental picture of me bending her over my desk. 

&nbsp;

Finally, my suspicions were functioning
slightly like they should, as we arrived at the place of her �family function�.
It was a Hotel that only the most wealthiest of the
city could afford to stay at, out the front, two men of Midderterainian
decent stood out the front, appearing as cheerful as a Russian that had lost
his vodka. Something about it, seemed so�wrong.
Something was out of place, yet, I could not put my finger on it. It was as if
the Andrea�s presence itself clouded my very judgement, and indeed, it was
quite possible. My infatuation for her had caused me to make more mistakes in
the past three days than I had in the past three years. 

&nbsp;

When we entered, the two men gave Andrea a
look and a nod of utmost respect, visiting upon me little more than a passing
glance.

&nbsp;

Now, it is of note at this point of time in
my recital to give just a little attention to the animal kingdom, and its
predators. One in particular, a tarantula of the Amazon, would spin its webs on
the floor of its lair, sometimes going out of its way to lure its unsuspecting
prey into such a trap. The prey could be a little predator itself, thinking it
was on the trail of a fine feast, only to find out that it was a lot lower down
on the food chain that it previously believed. Finding all its escape routes
blocked, the prey could do nothing but let the time pass before it met its
eventual end at the fangs of the real predator. 

&nbsp;

Such was my feeling when I entered into the
main function room. 

&nbsp;

The first thing I remember when entering
the main function room, was smoke. When Andrea and I opened a large door each,
it was like a truck made out of smoke came crashing into my face, threatening
to overwhelm all of my senses in a cloud of second degree cancer. Andrea herself, seemed immune to the fogs intoxicating effects. It
took a slight amount of seconds, but my senses swiftly adjusted themselves, and
I was able to function properly again, and I did so by taking a quick look
around the room. My stomach churned and twisted itself into a knot in my gut
when I did.

&nbsp;

The numerical ratio of gender lay clearly
in favour of men, all of which wore smart suits. All of which had styled black
hair, all of which looked like little predators in their own right. 

&nbsp;

All of which, were just like Andrea,
Italian. 

&nbsp;

As Andrea led me through the fumes so thick
I felt I needed a fog horn, I came to notice the way the men where seated at
their tables, with the oldest seated in a particular seat, only to have what
looked like the next two oldest at his flanks, and so on and so forth, like a
hierarchy of elders. The knowledgeable part of my brain knew what was
happening, but it�s voice of reason was being drowned
by the parasitical touch of fear. 

&nbsp;

When we reached Andrea�s parents, the
father did not stand up to shake my hand. She introduced me, speaking warmly of
me, and he gave me a respectful nod. He never stood up to address me. He sat on
his chair that was facing to the side of the table, dressed in an expensive
white suit jacket, black and white shoes on his feet. 

&nbsp;

This couldn�t be happening�how could I have been so fucking blind. 

&nbsp;

I took a seat next to Andrea. I was not
allowed to touch her in anyway other than on the hand, lest I come under the
vindictive glare of her father. 

&nbsp;

No�

&nbsp;

Andrea turned to me, her beautiful eyes now
seemingly be filled with smugness I never thought orbs of such beauty were
capable of, her words touching my heart like poison. 

&nbsp;

�Would you like to have anything to eat?�

&nbsp;

What could I tell her? �Yeah, sure, while your at it, get me a violin case so I have a chance of
getting out of here alive�.� Osirio.
She was a fucking Osirio. The Osirio�s.


&nbsp;

Throughout the night, I caught her father
looking at her, nothing but pride in his eyes. The way the parent of a predator
would beam proudly at their little cub that had torn apart its first victim. I
felt so small inside, a nauseating sensation at the top of my gut that
threatened to collapse until I was hollow. 

&nbsp;

I was boned. It was as simple as that. Being
the head of a company that dealt in the business that I tampered in, I
naturally had a group of goons that I could call upon to when muscle was
needed. But not on this scale. As it stood, Andrea had
willingly sacrificed her dignity and self-respect for one night, on the pay off
that I would soon be surrounded on all sides and out gunned, I dreaded to think
literally.

&nbsp;

Towards the end of the night, I was
approached by two young dark haired men, naturally, dressed in suits. It seems
I was being given the privilege of a poker game invitation, Andrea urged me to
accept, I foolishly did. What would have happened if I
had said no? It would have been like slapping both men in the face with my dick
in front of everyone present. As I was leaving the table to dance down
doom-lane, I could have sworn I saw Andrea smirk in the corner of my eye. 

&nbsp;

The game went surprisingly well at first,
and for a brief moment my current Mount Fucking-Everest of problems seemed so
far away. 

&nbsp;

�Sew, ah, John ey, wachu
tink of Andrea huh?� The man that had previously
identified himself as Jules spoke in a method that was almost indecipherable. 

&nbsp;

I knew I had to pick my words very
carefully. A scene where all six men at the table suddenly stood up played
through my head after I said one wrong word, it ended with them all pulling out
pistols and riddling me with bullets as I was blown backwards off my chair. All
this happened to the Mexican inspired theme of Pulp Fiction. 

&nbsp;

�She is a stunning young woman� I said
after what seemed to me like minutes. 

&nbsp;

The man to my direct right, Vince, laughed
a cheerful laugh. Lucky for him he had something to be cheerful about, he had not been lured by his dick into the lair of
the crafty bitch-queen.

&nbsp;

�Yeah, she�s something huh!� He said, a grin split his face from ear to ear. �I known �er since she was a gurl, she �ad
all tha boys at school bendin�
over backwards for �er!�

&nbsp;

As anxious as I was to enjoy hearing the
past success tales of my personal anti-christ, I
chose to instead offer a small smile as a false sign of my happiness. I felt a died a bit somewhat inside. 

&nbsp;

At Vinces
statement, the other men laughed to, the way employees laughed at a joke
cracked by a person they knew would one day be their boss. 

&nbsp;

�Remember that time she had trouble with
the mayor over some property?� Another man asked no one in particular, the way
all the men laughed soon after gave me the idea that it was a rhetorical
question more than a real one. 

&nbsp;

�Haha! Yeah, she�s a real shark aint she!�
Another gentleman cracked, nudging the man next to him as all six joined in a
chorus of laughter. 

&nbsp;

�Ey, dun worry kid� the eldest amongst them
said to me, noticing my failure to find any amusement in being brought here by
a woman these dangerous men referred to as �the shark�. 

&nbsp;

�She seems to like you, treat her right and
you shouldn�t have a problem�

&nbsp;

Oh joy� a woman known as �a real shark�
likes me. How could I ever express my happiness� 

&nbsp;

Was this the sensation they felt? I
wondered to myself. The sensation that all those women I had enslaved and sold
felt, when they realised that they had no hope what so ever of getting out of
their situation free. It was just a�helpless sensation. I hated it. The feeling
grabbed me by the heart that I was powerless to change the future course of
events that would lead me down whatever path fate had given me. Did fate, it
seem, have a sense of karma? I could only stare at my incoming destination and
pity myself. Now I knew why Deer�s didn�t jump out of the way of headlights,
instead they just stood there paralysed. 

&nbsp;

After another anecdote that hid the message
of Andrea being a vicious, ruthless bitch was shared around the table, the game
of poker started. Much to my relief, I was going well,
it eased the coil of tension in my stomach. The six men present hid their dark
disappointments as I threw down a 7 of hearts and an 8 of diamonds to complete
a straight, winning me a $25,000 pot. These boys, it seemed, played with big
figures. Money was to them, what women were to me: plentiful and for enjoyment
only.

Using Texas rules, there
were already four cards down, and from my point of view, the odds were stacked
in my favour. There was a 2 of hearts, a 3 of spades, an 8 of diamonds, a 9 of
diamonds and a 10 of diamonds on the table. In my hand, I had 7 of clubs, and a
Jack of spades. I couldn�t lose. 

&nbsp;

�I see your six grand�� A man I had come to
know as �Legs� said to the other man opposite him, staring at him with shifty
dark brown eyes. ��and I raise it to 500�

&nbsp;

My heart skipped a beat. $500,000?!
If I had not come to see Leg�s as little more than an elaborate bluffer through
the course of the current game, I would have stayed well back, but I didn�t. 

&nbsp;

�Im out�� Vince
replied, throwing his cards down. Now, all eyes where on me. 

&nbsp;

I had a straight, again. A
straight vs Legs reputation as a bluffer that had
just placed a stupidly high bet down. There was only once answer I could
give.

&nbsp;

�I have to fold, I don�t have the much to
give away� It was true. Selling women made money, but it cost a lot of money
also. I was well off, but well off enough that I could just throw half a
million dollars out the window and not miss it.

&nbsp;

A split second before I placed my cards
down on the table to symbolise my withdrawal, my heart seized itself from two
words.

&nbsp;

�I do� 

&nbsp;

I dared not look around. I did not need to, I knew who spoke with temptation laced into her voice.
Unfortunately, she placed herself down next to me, whatever her position was in
this �Families� hierarchy allowed her to impede upon such a game without social
consequences. 

&nbsp;

Giving her a feint look, my mind scrambled
to chose my words carefully. 

&nbsp;

�Its okay, I was thinking of pulling out
while I was ahead anyway�

&nbsp;

�Oh, you weren�t leaving where you?� Bitch
had twisted my words.

&nbsp;

�Of course not� I said, bringing to the
fore the warmest smile I could muster under a highly stressed and delicate
situation. Before I could continue however, she intercepted. 

&nbsp;

�Well that�s wonderful angel, I came in
hoping I could watch you play a bit more�

&nbsp;

My heart sank. What did I do? Bluntly turn
her down now, only to end up the victim of a drive by shooting tomorrow? Would
they find me in a weeks time with concrete shoes at
the bottom of a river? Would my face end up on the side of a milk box,
replacing that of 19 year old Jenna whom I had sold to a business woman in China?

&nbsp;

�That�s an awful lot�dear� I couldn�t
believe I was addressing her like she and I were an
item. We weren�t, were we? 

&nbsp;

�Nonesense� She
offered, smiling sweetly. A nest full of spiders would have given me a more
trusting smile. 

&nbsp;

�That�s what partners are for� 

&nbsp;

Once again, before I could intervene on my
own behalf, Andrea moved swiftly to secure her � and my � position. 

&nbsp;

�He continues� Then before I knew it, the
cards where back in my hand. 

&nbsp;

I felt a sneeze coming on; no, that was
just the sense of defeat approaching.

&nbsp;

&quot;A straight!� proclaimed Legs . My head spun.

&nbsp;

He threw down his cards, revealing a Jack,
and � almost a splitting imagine from the manipulative bitch beside me � a
Queen. 

&nbsp;

�Now� Legs started, his face suddenly
becoming nasty, the way a predator adopted a cruel visage to make a preys
transition from one life to the next as unpleasant as possible.

&nbsp;

�Lets see �is
fucking cards�.

&nbsp;

My Jack was beaten by the Queen.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

oOo

&nbsp;

As I screwed that Italian temptress that
night, nothing but the thought of my imminent fall ran through my head. 

&nbsp;

We had come back to my place, and I was
showered with her false sympathies. Clothes had quickly fallen from our bodies,
and it was not long until we were both naked in my bed room: her beautiful
naked body on all fours while I thrusted my member
deep into her warm, wet love-tunnel, encasing my dick with the taste of Italy. 

&nbsp;

Gripping her slender hips tightly with my
rough, manly hands, my hips lunged forwards and back, driving my thick, meaty
dick deep into the beautiful Italian whom I now owed $500,000. The head of my
dick felt warm as the shaft was constricted by her tight pussy, the beautiful
light brown lips stretched around the thick width of my shaft. 

&nbsp;

There had been foreplay, but I was not on
the receiving end. I had eaten pussy for the first time in my life; I had had
my face pushed in between the legs of a triumphant
woman intent on grinding home the message as clearly as possible. My spirit had
been too eroded by previous events to muster the defiance I would normally have
at the thought of submitting in any way to a female, and thus I had been little
more than putty in her claws. Just like she was, her pussy was a work of art;
beautiful and tender, a small thin black down-pointing triangle shaped pubic
mound rested above the lips. It served as a reminder of where my face now
belonged when she desired pleasure, directing my face down like a sign. 

&nbsp;

Tilting my head back and offering a grunt
of pleasure, my scrotum tightened as the balls inside pumped their load into
the stunning woman, painting the walls of her pussy with warm sticky cum for
the third time tonight. Panting, almost exhausted, I lay down beside her, as
she did similar, her euphoric body glistening with sweat in the dim light. She
deliberately ensured that when she lay down, her head rested slightly higher
than mine. Cunning bitch. 

&nbsp;

One of Andrea�s hands traced its way across
my chest. I felt ensnared. I felt the warm, firm flesh of her luscious chest
globes press against my shoulder as she pulled herself closer to me. �Such lovely tits she had, firm and perky, both
of them, each one tipped by a lovely light brown nipple. Nipples it would soon
be my duty to pleasure, suckling on them like a child. That�s what she wanted,
I knew it. Not just the physical pleasure, but rendering a man down to such a
level he suckled on her breast like a dependant baby. Could I give her such
power over me? 

&nbsp;

What where my options? Leave town and live
the rest of my life in fear of her goons hunting me down? She knew where I
lived, she knew my contact details and she knew that I owed her more than � of
a million dollars. What if I somehow did manage to pay her, could I simply tell
her that it was over? I knew for certain that I couldn�t touch a woman like
this, not anymore, Id end up dead by the end of the week. I might even end up
dead at the end of the week if I told her it was over, what if she was a
possessive woman? Once I made that pledge to her, however slight, was I her
property until she deemed it necessary to dismiss me from her service? The
property of a woman�how had I sunk so low in such an eye blink of time, and
feel so useless to change it?

&nbsp;

Was pussy my new master now? The thing I
lived to serve, not profit from. She had an invisible leash around my neck, the
leash of fear. It did not need to be said, but I could see it in those
deceptively lustrous eyes. �Leave me, and you�ll wish you handnt�.
It was a clear message, in her eyes I belonged to her now. 

&nbsp;

�Mmmm, darling��
she purred on my shoulder, sighing softly as she nuzzled her lips softly
against my ear. 

&nbsp;

��suck me off again,
Ive had such a stressful day�. 

&nbsp;

I mentally translated what she said: �You,
my new possession, suck my genitals to remind yourself where you belong�.

&nbsp;

This was nonsense, I was a man! A man! I
did not bow before the whims of some temptress, even if I did owe her money. 

&nbsp;

��no� my defiance at first was meek. 

&nbsp;

She chuckled slightly, like I had just
softly muttered a small joke. 

&nbsp;

�Make it snappy babe� she replied
playfully, but I could see past the playfulness. I could see the lurking cold
darkness, and even if I had not have ended up in the position I had today, I
wouldn�t be ashamed to say that what I saw scared me.

&nbsp;

�No� I retorted, this time standing my
ground, soaking up firmness from my new found confidence. I was a man, she was
a woman. She belonged on her knees. 

&nbsp;

�Your serious��
Andrea spoke, her lyrical voice adapting to meet the potential aggression being
thrown at her.

&nbsp;

�That�s right, Im
not your boot lick� 

&nbsp;

I got out of the bed, pulling myself away
from her clutches, no matter how soft her skin was, or how bouncy and firm her
breasts where to play with. Or how tasty, and juicy and succulent her pussy
was, or how�I shook these things from my thoughts, trying in vein to gain
clarity. 

&nbsp;

Andrea, did not seem surprised, instead,
she remained laying there in bed, propping herself up on her elbow. The sheets
fell away, revealing those gorgeous breasts of hers, just waiting from a man to come along and slap them and
pinch those light brown nipples until they were pink with pain. 

&nbsp;

�Well, where did this come from?� 

&nbsp;

�This came from here� I spat, motioning
with my hand to my groin area. As primitive as it was, it was still a symbol of
manhood. 

&nbsp;

�Tsk, burst your
ego bubble did I angel?� 

&nbsp;

I saw red, the calmness with which she
responded unnerved me, and at the same time made me furious. Stupid bitch, how
dare she! I may have owed her money, but she was below me. 

&nbsp;

�I owe you money, which I will pay, but
unless you want to face the ceiling, open your legs and shut up,
get the fuck out of my house!�

&nbsp;

My aggressive proposition was met with more
infuriating calm, the urge to stride back over to the bed, hold her hands above
her head and slap those tits of hers like a pair of bongo�s was almost
overpowering. But I knew that while I could shout at her, I couldn�t touch her
like that. Not this one. Such impulses would have to be brought out on my
secretary when I bent her over her own desk tomorrow and rammed her good and
hard like the whore she was. Yes, she�d be the scape goat of my fury. 

&nbsp;

�Im not going
anywhere darling� she spoke, the ease with which she expressed herself was
incalculable to me. Women are emotional creatures, shout at them and they get upset.
This one seemed nothing like that. She slid herself out of bed, feeling no
embarrassment in standing only two feet away from me in nothing but her
birthday suit. 

&nbsp;

�What did you say?� I did my best to
intimidate, to try and overbear her the way the pack alpha looms over the
omega. 

&nbsp;

�You heard me, I didn�t stutter� 

&nbsp;

The words hung between our naked bodies,
her and my eyes locked together, each refusing to be the first to look away.
Had she done this before? How many other poor men had been put in their place
by this temptress? I would eventually find out the answer was quite simply,
lots. 

&nbsp;

Then, the words came out, a simple
statement that I knew in the deepest recesses of my belief at the time to be
true.

&nbsp;

�I own you� Andrea said, her voice taking
on an edge of firmness I had never seen in a woman. Mostly due to the fact I
only ever dealt with the submissive type. 

&nbsp;

To this, I at first could not respond.
Andrea was a predator, a lone wolf that saw this as the first cracks in my ego.


&nbsp;

�You can wave that meat at me all you wish,
pet� she continued, taking a step closer to me and resting a hand on my hip.

&nbsp;

�But you know, just as well as I do, that
there�s only going to be one form of order in this apartment from now on. Mine�

&nbsp;

Was this what proud men feared? The threat of the capable woman; the woman that doesn�t need them,
thus rendering them feeling like they are useless? Could this be the
reason so many men felt so insecure around competent and capable females, that
they had nothing to offer them?

&nbsp;

�Get out you bitch, Ill have your money by
next week then I want you and your poison out of my life� Defiant words on my
behalf, but my heart already told me such brash words were little more than a
futile attempt to reorganize myself. 

&nbsp;

She placed her other hand on my hip, and
brought herself closer. I could feel the head of my penis press against her
waist line. I stared down at her, her raven black hair beautiful and shiny, a
curled lock of that black mane fell over her eye.

&nbsp;

�You owe me as much money as this apartment
is worth.� She started, the list of her advantages beginning.

&nbsp;

�I know where you live.� I could only stand
there and listen.

&nbsp;

�Ive done what no
other woman has ever done to you: Ive gotten past
your ego�

&nbsp;

She looked up at me, her smile alluring and
sinister all at the same time. Could my eroded spirit let this woman win? This
beautiful female could gain pure power over me, if only I just let go of my
tattered ego. It had been ruined the moment I walked into that main function
room, and I had seen the backing Andrea had in her corner. It made mine seem
so, insignificant. 

&nbsp;

�I bet you�ve never even pressed your
tongue against another womans vagina until tonight�
She whispered to me, having brought her face so close to mine, she could
whisper and I would hear it like she had spoken to me. 

&nbsp;

�That night� I said, trying to recover
ground.

&nbsp;

�I rammed my cock down your throat and made
you gag. You were just another bitch that I had creamed, you still are�

&nbsp;

To this, she chuckled. A
chuckle that sounded to me like rusty gates closing me off from freedom.


&nbsp;

�A means to an end, my pet�

&nbsp;

Was I now her pet? Had my spirit and male
defiance been corroded so much by the events of a single night that I could
crumble so easily? Or maybe it just seemed easy to one who had not had such a
cherished thing as a man�s own pride taken away from them by the very thing it
was meant to protect them from. 

&nbsp;

Then, the truth hit me. I never had
defiance. I never had spirit. I had nothing but ego, my personal pride. All
these years, it had been the foundation of everything that I had believed in
and done. My pride had extended from myself, to my gender, and through that, a
self given sense of superiority for no other reason that it was mine. Just as a ceiling would come
crashing down if you removed the pillars supporting it, so had my belief in my
elevation above women been destroyed by removing the sole principle thing that
had given it inspiration. Yet at the same time, I felt within my being a
section of essence being relieved, like a giant weight had been lifted from my
chest. Was it the weight of dignity? 

&nbsp;

�Now, darling�� she said, looking into my
eyes that from her point of view, seemed to be staring at something in the far
distance. 

&nbsp;

She brought her face alongside mine, and
our cheeks brushed together. Her soft, full lips pressed against my ear, and
she whispered;

&nbsp;

�Suck me off�.

&nbsp;

I felt like a soldier that had just seen
the entire reason he fought destroyed before his very eyes, shattering his
morale and will to fight beyond repair. 

&nbsp;

Andrea remained standing, as I lowered
myself on my knees before her, like a servant. She smiled down at me and spread
her feet a litte, but I did not smile back, not yet.
Now I knew what it felt like to be a teenage girl giving her boyfriend head for
the first time; on her knees in front of him, proceeding cautiously in fear of
hurting him. I submissively ate her delicious honey-brown pussy, bringing her
to a climax while she firmly held my head in place, pulling her hips back
slightly so she could rub herself through the final stages of yet another
orgasm with one hand; blowing a load of woman juice over my face when she came.
I knew what it all symbolised, the irony was clear. 

&nbsp;

She ordered me to remain kneeling there,
and I did. She disappeared into my lounge room, and I did not see her again for
two more hours, though I did hear the fridge opening and the TV exporting its
programs during that time. I remained there, patiently awaiting her return like
a hollow porcelain doll waiting for its owner to come back to play with them. 

&nbsp;

My days of superiority over females were
gone. I had been over proud, a flaw that had cost me dearly. I still owed her
the money, despite turning over ownership of my apartment to her. I accepted my
lot with a half-lifted enthusiasm. I didn�t have any rights, no property,
nothing; I was her pet. When she sat on the couch to watch TV, I sat on the
floor next to her, like an obedient man-bitch, because that�s just what I was.
Woman rules this man, and I don�t see that aspect of my life changing any day
soon.

&nbsp;

In some strange changing way within myself,
I don�t think I want it to.
