The
Greenwich Tales

By Freddie Clegg
&amp; Phil Lane

Introduction &amp; New Readers Start Here�

&nbsp;

This story sprang out
of an exchange of emails between the Phil and Freddie during the posting of the
Freddie Clegg story �Market Forces�. The two authors discovered a shared
interest in Len Deighton�s �The Ipcress File� and an enthusiasm for exploring
what happened to some of the characters outside of the Market Forces narrative.
This is the result of that correspondence and a collaboration to create a new
tale. 

&nbsp;

If you have read Market
Forces then you can skip the rest of this introduction.

&nbsp;

If not, shame on you
(and if you like this then search it out, you�ll like that too), but you might
like to know that��

&nbsp;

Freddie Clegg
Enteprises is a UK based organisation specialising in the acquisition, training
and sale of female slaves. You�ll meet up with some of the employees of Clegg Enterprises
as the tales are told and they�ll introduce themselves as they go along. You
will also meet two of Clegg�s customers; Daphne Challis (an American
entrepreneur) and Steve Glennis, a man of leisure whose main hobby is the
stable of pony girls he keeps on his Caribbean island. 

&nbsp;

It�s Steve�s story that
starts us off� 

Prologue 

&nbsp;

Now, I�m no fan of
medieval literature. In fact after you�ve got past the contents of the average
castle�s dungeon, my interest in things medieval wanders off. I had to read The
Canterbury Tales when I was at school. I was surprised by how much smut there
was in history. Some of it was filthy. 

&nbsp;

Geoffrey Chaucer wrote the
Canterbury Tales in around 1400AD. It�s a tale of a group of pilgrims and it starts
like this�

�

����������� �When in April the sweet showers fall

����������� That pierce March's drought to the root and all

����������� �..

����������� Then folk do long to go on pilgrimage,

����������� And pilgrims to go seeking out strange strands,

����������� To distant shrines, well known, in distant lands.�

&nbsp;

These days, it�s not so
common for pilgrims to go to distant shrines in distant lands but there are
other pilgrimages, other shrines, other grails.

&nbsp;

My name�s Steve.
There�s this woman I know; Daphne. We share some interests. She had some
problems. I was concerned about her but somehow I never got around to helping
out. I�m not proud of that, it�s just the way things are some times. 

&nbsp;

It turned out not to
matter. She solved her own problems. She�s been on a pilgrimage but sometimes
you don�t end up where you think you are going and sometimes you do. You might
like to hear about it. 

&nbsp;

Like many pilgrims,
Daphne�s path was eased by others on the way. There was a Merchant, a seller of
souls. He found a Student for Daphne. Then a Clerk sought out someone else to
help Daphne on her path. She encountered a Counsellor and �..

&nbsp;

But that�s putting the
cart before the horse � and if you know me then you know that�s something I
never, ever, do!

&nbsp;

It�s probably easier if
they all tell their own tales�

The
Merchant�s Tale 

Part 1 : When
Larry Met Daphne

&nbsp;

I first met Daphne
shortly after I�d joined Freddie Clegg Enterprises. I was flying back from a
trip to the Caribbean. She was on the same �plane. My first impression of her
wasn�t great. She looked shabby; overweight, badly dressed, poor complexion and
greasy hair.� I guessed that she was
about forty but it was hard to say. She could have been older.

&nbsp;

Perhaps I should
introduce myself. I�m Larry. I look after marketing for Clegg. Well at least I
did when all this kicked off. This was one of the last jobs I was involved in
before I moved on to run one of his new business ventures. 

&nbsp;

Clegg�s organisation is
what you might euphemistically call a recruitment agency; except our recruits
usually weren�t planning on a change of role before they met up with us. I
suppose slave traders is the real name for what we are. The Caribbean trip had
been to meet with a potential customer, a chap called Steve Glennis. No, he wasn�t
planning on using his purchases to start a new sugar plantation. I�ll let you
guess what he wanted them for but here�s a hint. They were all young. They were
all women. 

&nbsp;

Daphne just seemed like
another potential client when we spoke on the flight. My first thought was that
she seemed pretty greedy as she sat next to me stuffing her face with snacks.
But, since it seemed likely that would extend to her tastes in slaves, I just
saw that as a potential opportunity for us. She certainly had the money to pay
for them according to Clegg. 

&nbsp;

After our discussion on
the �plane and her suggestion that we might do some business I asked Rick�s
team in our research department to do a profile of her �Daphne Challis,� their
report said, �was borne in Boston, USA. Her father was in the US diplomatic
service, divorced shortly after she was borne but she stayed with him. She�d grown
up pretty much everywhere, spending time in most of the countries across
Europe. Picked up language skills in French, German and Spanish. Clever at
school, but somehow she never got the knack of getting on with people socially.
She read economics and accountancy at university, graduating very well. She
joined a City bank as a foreign exchange trader, managed to cope with the
bullying and sexism by ignoring pretty much everything except making money. Now
in her mid thirties (I�d got her age wrong by at least five years � the way
that most women wouldn�t ever forgive you for) she was a millionaire several
times over and she�s mainly into investing. She used her capital in small
entrepreneurial start-ups and her contacts in the city for any funding that she
couldn�t cover from her own resources.�
In her private life though she seemed to be still a lonely, awkward,
socially inept, individual. Her business associates found it hard to square her
business acumen and acquisitive drive with her lack of social skills - as one
said, she�s like a little girl with a big bag of money.� 

&nbsp;

That much I could
recognise in the woman I�d met on the �plane.

&nbsp;

�It�s not clear when
she first started keeping slaves.� The report went on. �The first purchase
transactions that we are aware of were three years ago. Anecdotal evidence
suggests that she had a number of BDSM relationships in her early twenties and
that at some point she made the transition from consensual to non-consensual
slave ownership. There were at least three male slaves �owned� by her at first.
The Clegg organisation became aware of Challis first when she offered these
three for sale at an auction run by one of our competitors in the States and
acquired three females as replacements. Since then she has replaced these on a
fairly regular basis, keeping three or four at any one time, not retaining any
of them for more than six or seven months. She always takes trained /
conditioned stock under twenty five years, but of no particular racial origin.
She�s bought and sold around a dozen slaves that we are aware of. The money
doesn�t seem to be a problem because she�s losing money every time she trades
them in but it hasn�t affected how she�s been buying. To date none of her
purchases have been through the Clegg Organisation, they have all been in US
markets. She has been based in the Hamptons until three months ago. It is
understood that she may be moving to the UK.�

&nbsp;

Part 2 : First
Client Contact

&nbsp;

The report told me a
bit more than I�d worked out for myself. As it turned out, it was useful
background when I got a call from her. She was planning to set up in the UK,
she said, and thought we might be able to let her have some pieces for her
household over here. I said we could probably help. We agreed to meet. I
suggested a restaurant in the West End; she came up with an alternative, �The
Rose By The River Hotel.� I hadn�t heard of it but then I�m like a lot of taxi
drivers � I hardly ever go south of the river.

&nbsp;

When I got there, I
realised I�d been missing something. It billed itself as a boutique hotel. Not
far from Tate Modern and the Globe Theatre, it was a short walk from Borough
Market and the City itself.

&nbsp;

I got to the sixth
floor and the restaurant. Daphne was already there. As I walked in she was
chewing on a mouthful of food that had her face stuffed as well as the gags
that we use in the Prep Centre. She barely paused in her eating and waved me
across to join her. The remains of a rump steak, half a pile of chips, a smear
of pepper sauce and an untouched portion of vegetables decorated the plate in
front of her. A dribble of sauce was running down her chin. She wiped it as she
swallowed the mouthful of food. I thought it wasn�t a great menu choice. From
what I remembered of her backside, the last thing she needed was more rump.

&nbsp;

�Larry,� she said
holding out a limp hand, �nice to see you again.� She smiled. I could see a
piece of steak wedged between her two front teeth.

&nbsp;

�Ms Challis,� I said.
�Good to see you, too.� I wasn�t being entirely sincere but she was a potential
customer after all.

&nbsp;

�Daphne,� she said,
�it�s Daphne. Do you want to eat?� She asked. Without waiting for a reply, she
called across to a waitress. �Hey,� she called. Can we get a menu here?� The
waitress seemed more than a little pained by Daphne�s lack of finesse. She
produced an impressively large menu and put on the table in front of me.� Daphne carried on eating. It wasn�t the most
entertaining of sights. One forkful followed another into her mouth with barely
a pause. There were a couple of sticks of white asparagus on the side of the
plate. She picked one up with fingers sticky from pepper sauce that had
dribbled down her fork and guided its head to her lips. I found the sight of
her sucking at the white, fleshy vegetable slightly disturbing.

&nbsp;

I hadn�t been very
hungry before I arrived and somehow even the vaguest interest in food had
disappeared. I didn�t see anything on the menu that I fancied. I passed it back
to the waitress and shook my head. Daphne shovelled the last fork full of chips
into her mouth. �I�ll never work out why you guys call fries chips and chips
crisps,� she said to me. Turning to the waitress she said, �Chocolate
cheesecake.�

&nbsp;

The waitress said,
�Cream or ice cream?�

&nbsp;

Daphne said, �Both.�

� 

I said, �How can we
help?�

&nbsp;

�I�ve got a
requirement,� she said. �I�m going to be based here for a while. I�ve got a
suite here in the hotel for a few weeks but I�m moving into a new place in
Greenwich.� I need a house-piece. Someone
to keep the place clean and me happy. You seemed to know what you were talking
about when we met on Narod Jesper�s plane and Steve Glennis said you did a good
job for him.�

&nbsp;

�Thanks for the
compliments.�

&nbsp;

�I trust Glennis�s
call. He was a big help when I first started out owning rather than playing.
It�s a big change. He was really useful.�

&nbsp;

�How about Jesper?�

&nbsp;

Daphne coughed. The
waitress appeared with her desert. The food looked excellent but it was
obviously the size of the portions that attracted Daphne. �Too weird for me,�
she said. �We�ve done a few private transactions; he�s taken a couple of girls
off me. I�ve had one of his. He sold the plane, you know?�

&nbsp;

I nodded. �Yeah, I came
across the stewardesses a while back in Switzerland.�

&nbsp;

�Oh yes. I heard about
that from Steve. Even Clegg�s team screws up occasionally, then?�

&nbsp;

�We worked things out.
Steve was happy in the end. We ended up buying the girls.�

&nbsp;

�So I hear.� She ran
through what she was looking for. It didn�t seem anything special; - just a
slave girl that would do for domestic and bedroom duties while Daphne was
getting set up. It seemed straight forward. Then she added the rider. �Oh, and
she needs to speak Portuguese.�

&nbsp;

�Portuguese?�

&nbsp;

�Uh huh. I�m going to
be doing quite a lot of work with some Brazilian companies, opportunities with
eco-friendly fuels, renewable energy resources, that sort of thing. It�s going
to be hot technology. I need a translator.�

&nbsp;

�Not, I hope, with a
degree in bio-tech or engineering?� I was only half joking, we�ve been asked
for more specific requirements.

&nbsp;

�That would be good,
but, no, not essential. I just want someone that can I can rely on for some of
the more interesting documents.�

&nbsp;

Portuguese wasn�t so
easy � we�d never done much in Spain or Portugal � but I thought Rick would be
able to come up with something.

� 

Daphne thought she�d
want maybe a couple more pieces when she was settled but the place she was
moving into only really had secure accommodation for one at the moment. She
wasn�t very specific about what she wanted beyond the language thing. I asked
her whether she�d be happy with something from stock; I was thinking maybe one
of our European associate groups might have something. Maybe the Contessa might
have something. She shrugged her shoulders. She just didn�t seem bothered.
�Just get me a good one,� she said. She waved to the waitress for the bill. It
appeared with a bowl of mints. She picked up her handbag, Louis Vuitton in soft
brown leather with a stain that looked like dried mustard just by the catch.
Daphne pulled out her purse and flipped her key card onto the bill without
reading it.

&nbsp;

The waitress picked up
the card and went in search of her payment terminal. Daphne emptied the dish of
mints into her handbag. She paid the bill. �Call me when you�ve got something
to view,� she said. �You�ve got my number.� She got her feet and moved towards
the door. She didn�t move as if she was comfortable with it. Walking didn�t
seem to be something she was big on.

&nbsp;

The waitress came over
to clear the table as I got up to leave. Daphne had made such a good job of
clearing her desert that they wouldn�t really have to wash the plate. I was
pretty sure the waitress let out a sigh of relief as Daphne waddled away.

&nbsp;

I gave her a
sympathetic smile. �Takes all sorts,� I said, and left her.

&nbsp;

The
Student�s Tale

Part 1 : The
Albert Hall

&nbsp;

I am Branca. I used to
study here in London. It�s not easy being a student here in London. Not when
you come here from abroad. Everyone is so busy; it is hard to make good
friends. And it is so expensive. Much more expensive here than in Lisbon or in
my home town, Porto.

&nbsp;

But it is good to study
here. The Imperial College is very good. To be studying engineering there is
very good. And I thought I would have many friends. In Lisbon there were not so
many girls that study engineering. Here it is the same but the boys, well they
all work hard. It is not easy to get to know them. I think I am attractive.
Perhaps I am a bit tall for the boys here: 1.8 metres but that should not
matter? I like my black hair, I�m proud of how it shines. In Porto the boys
think I look fine. Sometimes they are a bit too enthusiastic. If I want to
study I have to shoo them away. But here the boys do not seem to notice my hair
or my body. They think only of their books.

&nbsp;

And London is so
expensive. That is why I had a job as well as I my studies. To help pay for my
flat and for my books. But for my job it was good to be Portuguese. There are
not so many of us here in London so for translating there is a demand. And I
made some good money from translating. From Portuguese into English, from
English into Portuguese. I worked for an agency. They have a good system � for
all their translators they have a web site it says to their clients what areas
of specialising their people have. For me it says for engineering both
electrical and mechanical and also bio-tech. Their clients can look for just
the right person for what they want.�� 

&nbsp;

I wonder if that is how
they found me?

&nbsp;

A man phoned me. He
said he had some work that he believed I could help him with. I told him that
he must speak to the agent. They get cross if I do freelance work. He said it
was more to do with the university, some papers from another student. He just
wanted someone to take a look at them and tell him what they were about. He
wasn�t sure if they were important and worth translating or not. Perhaps if he
bought me coffee? Well it didn�t seem like it could do any harm.

&nbsp;

He was nice. He said
his name was Harry. He showed me the papers. I read them through while we had
some coffee. They were about a plant for producing bio-diesel. There are many
developments of this kind in Brazil now. I told him I thought they were useful
for someone planning to invest in bio-diesel technology. He asked if I could
translate them properly for him. If his friend found it useful there would be
other work but that he would put through my agent, of course. 

&nbsp;

I thought it would be
all right. It was not so much work and if my agent got a big contract he would
not mind.

&nbsp;

I phoned him when I had
finished. Could he collect it that evening, he said. He had to be at a concert
at the Royal Albert Hall. Perhaps I could bring it by afterwards? I said of
course. It is very close to the college. Just around the corner from the
library. It will be easy, I said.

&nbsp;

It is very busy there,
just after a concert. Everyone, milling around. A great bustle of people,
chatting and laughing. And then it is very quiet. They all go home, of course.
After the concert. And the pavements were empty. I saw him hurrying towards me.
He waved. He was obviously worried that I would have gone.

&nbsp;

There were two others
with him. Two women. �Eva,� he said and �Doctor Jordan� They looked friendly.
It looked like they have all had a good time at the concert. �Come and have
some coffee,� he said. �Please come,� said Eva, �Harry says you are from near
Lisbon, I�d love to hear about it.� 

&nbsp;

So I said, �Yes,� and
we walked to his car. It was parked not far away. Thurlow Gardens. It was a big
car, a people carrier, a Mercedes, almost like a small van. Big and black with
blacked out windows. I was telling Eva about Lisbon, about the Alfama, the old
town. We all climbed in, Harry driving, Eva and the Doctor and me in the back. 

&nbsp;

The car moved off. I
remember we were going towards Marble Arch. Harold said, �We are very pleased
with your work Branca.� 

&nbsp;

Eva said, �I told him
we need to take you on full time.� I think she is joking. I said, �No, but I am
at University.�

&nbsp;

And then Eva was
pointing a gun at me and saying, �Sorry, Branca. You haven�t understood. We are
taking you on full time. Just don't argue.� And the car was going quickly,
along Park Lane. 

&nbsp;

I was saying no and
pulling away but Eva pushed the gun against me. The Doctor leaned across me and
makes a cut through my tights with scissors and she says �this will make you
feel better Branca�, and she pressed a hypodermic into my thigh. I am struggling
now but Eva and the doctor are holding me. There is a warm numb feeling in my
leg. 

&nbsp;

I heard Eva, say �So
what is that? 

&nbsp;

The Doctor said,
�Ketamine. It�s safe, if you know what you�re doing, it doesn�t have to go into
a vein and it�s quite quick and the more Branca struggles the quicker it is �
The inside of the van seemed to go dark but I could see bright lights through
the windows still.� I wanted cry out but
somehow my mouth wouldn�t work any more. I fell back against Eva, seeing Doctor
Jordan smiling. 

&nbsp;

And then�� 

&nbsp;

When I woke up I was in
a strange room. I was on a bed but I could not get off. Eva was sitting by me.
There were wires from pads on my chest going to a monitor. &nbsp;There was a
tube going into my arm from a bag of fluid hanging from a metal pole at the
side of the bed. I asked Eva, �What happened? Am I in hospital?� 

&nbsp;

�No, Branca, but you
are somewhere safe. You are with us.�

&nbsp;

Then Doctor Jordan came
in and I started to remember what happened in the car. �How are you feeling
now, Branca?� Dr Jordan said.

&nbsp;

I was confused; they
seemed so kind but they had taken me away. �I am feeling tired and sick. I want
to go home now,� I said. 

&nbsp;

�Don�t worry,� Doctor
Jordan says. �You may not remember what has happened to you, just as you may
forget a dream. It will take some time before you feel well again. Movement is
extremely difficult. It is better for you to stay here. You are home here,
Branca.�

&nbsp;

�No I want to go to my
home,� I say. I tried to get up. I couldn�t.

&nbsp;

Eva said, �Branca you
are ours now. Our home is your home. You must stay here.�

&nbsp;

I felt so weak. Doctor
Jordan said for me to rest, �and when you are ready, we will move you to your
very own room.� 

&nbsp;

I tried to get up again
and&nbsp;then I saw they had strapped me to the bed. I was frightened, I started
to cry. Doctor Jordan put her arms round me. She talked softly. She said, �You
will be&nbsp;fine, Branca. We will look after you. You will be safe now with
us. You'll see.�

&nbsp;

I don�t know how long
it was before I woke up again. I was still in the room, still strapped to the
bed. I don�t know if it was the drugs but I didn�t seem to mind. It was quite
dark. The walls were bare, the floor just tiles. There was a window but it was
covered over with frosted glass.

&nbsp;

Later on Doctor
Jordan&nbsp;took the tube out of my arm. She let me get up from the bed and
walk around the room. They had taken all my clothes. &nbsp;�How are you,
Branca?� she asked.

&nbsp;

I was&nbsp;shaky. It
was hard to stand and walk. The Doctor gave me a sweet orange drink and I began
to feel stronger. �Now Branca, now you are here there are many thing you have
to learn, many things you have to know. You want to learn don�t you? Like at
the University?�

&nbsp;

It seemed strange to
me, not like the University at all, but I heard myself saying, �Yes, I want to
learn.�

&nbsp;

�Good,� said Doctor
Jordan, �It is time for you to start to learn. We have someone to help you to
learn. Connie will help you to learn. Connie is very good.� For a moment
everything seemed strange and I thought I would fall over but Doctor Jordan
reached out to hold me. �Do you&nbsp;trust me, Branca? Do you?� she asked. I
nodded. �We�ll go and see Connie.�&nbsp;

&nbsp;

The Doctor put a wide
leather belt round my waist and cuffed my hands to it. I suppose it seems
strange but it did not occur to me to try to stop her. She put a blindfold on
me and gently guided me somewhere else.&nbsp;

&nbsp;

There was another girl
there, waiting for me:&nbsp;she had a deepish voice and a sweet perfume. I
heard her say, �Is this the one?�

&nbsp;

�Yes,� said Doctor
Jordan. �She�s all yours now.�

&nbsp;

�Kneel down,� the other
voice said. �This is Connie speaking, Branca. You must do as I say.�

&nbsp;

I said, �Oh!� and �Yes.�
I was still confused but I got down to my knees. Someone put a bar between my
teeth and strapped it behind my head. It felt hard and tasted of
rubber.&nbsp;Connie trapped my head between her legs and brought a cane down on
my bottom several times.� I squealed with
pain and grunted around the gag. I was whimpering. Connie heard my sobbing and
crouched down beside me. I felt the side of her face pressed against
mine.&nbsp;�Hush, Branca, don�t cry. If you are obedient then all will be
well.&nbsp;You can make things better by being obedient. Stop crying and you
can see me.� She held me closely. Somehow I wanted to see her. I wanted her to
take off the blindfold. �Stop crying Branca.� I sniffed back my tears. �That�s
better,� said Connie. �Start crying again and it goes on again. Stop crying and
you can see. You will soon learn to do your best for Connie.� Eventually I
stopped crying. 

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Part 2 : New
Learning&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Connie took off the
blindfold. I shook my head and looked around me. I saw the room was small and
cold, just bare walls and a tiled floor. There was a rubber mat on the floor
and where the floor dips down was&nbsp;a toilet with a shower head by it over a
floor drain.&nbsp;

&nbsp;

A black skinned girl
stood in front of me. She looked African. Her face was finely boned as if made
from some black porcelain. Her black hair was braided and tied back tight. She
was wearing riding boots over tight cream trousers and had on a white leather T
shirt. A riding whip hung from the belt of her trousers.&nbsp;She wore white
leather gloves. She had a gold ring glinting in the septum of her nose. She
looked so confident and strong and so very ....&nbsp;desirable. She smiled.
White teeth. �Hello, Branca,� she said. �I'm Connie.�

&nbsp;

I looked up at her.

&nbsp;

She crouched down
beside me, her head close to mine. �Branca, you know you must learn? You work
hard and&nbsp;earn your privileges. You understand?�

&nbsp;

I nodded.

&nbsp;

�You thirsty?� Connie
said.&nbsp;I nodded eagerly. �Uh huh? &nbsp;That�s good. I'll take out your gag
so you can drink.� She unbuckled the strap and the rubber bar came clear of my
mouth. �If you want it to keep the gag out of your mouth put your face at my
feet, rub your face on my boots.� I whimpered but I didn�t want the gag back, I
bent my face to her feet, pressing it against her boots feeling and smelling
the leather. She spoke again. �What about hungry? Branca? Uh huh?� I gave an
mmm in response. �Well,� Connie said, �ask me to shave your head and then you
can eat.�

&nbsp;

I was puzzled, confused
by her response. 

&nbsp;

�Sorry Branca, that was
not quick enough,� Connie said pulling her feet away from my face. �You have to
learn to&nbsp;say yes quickly. Not only obey but obey quickly.� With that she
chained my ankle to the wall and left me locked alone in the room.

&nbsp;

When Connie came back
she asked the same question. This time I managed to say, �Yes. Yes, please
shave me.�

&nbsp;

Connie looked down at
me disapproving.&nbsp; �Not good enough, Branca,� she said. �I think you are
not happy about being shaven. It is not enough to do as you are told you must
want it. You must be happy with it. We�ll try once more, one more chance today
if you want to eat.�

&nbsp;

So I pleaded with her,
begged her to shave me. Told her I hated my hair and that nothing would please
me more than to lose it. Connie smiled, pleased with my response. �That�s
better Branca, come over here,� she said. She bent my head over the toilet. I
heard the soft whirr of clippers and felt the slight pulling sensation as she
ran them from the nape of my neck up to the crown, over and over again. I saw
all my hair falling away, together with my tears. Connie lifted my shaven head
and turned my tear streaked face towards her. �Tears, Branca?� she said, sadly.
�I said you must be happy with being obedient. Tears means you cannot be happy.
That means just raw vegetables for your food today.�

&nbsp;

That was how it
started, how I learned to obey and be happy obeying. Life was simple. There was
just me and Connie. She was my only visitor and as the weeks&nbsp;passed I
found myself asking Connie to beat me, rape me, to let me lick her bare feet,
do anything she told me to do, to think of things she might want me to do. And
to obey and to enjoy obeying. And gradually I earned a warmer room, a blanket
at night. She&nbsp;stopped shaving my head. They gave me more to eat than raw
vegetables and water. And I began to think that I loved her and finally&nbsp;I
would do just anything she asked me to do to her or for her. And then, when she
brought her boy friends and girl friends and I would do anything she wanted for
them, too.

&nbsp;

Then one day Doctor
Jordan and Connie both came to see me. The Doctor says, �My, Branca, you have
done well! I am very pleased with you!� She stroked my hair. It was growing
back. As long as I obeyed, Connie let me keep my hair. I�d been very good. It
was still very short of course, but you could not see my scalp. That�s how good
I�d been. �Just look at your hair now.� She can tell I am puzzled by her
arrival. �It�s time to pass you on to your Owner.� She sees my distress at
realising I must leave Connie. �You have been chosen specially, Branca. Chosen
for your language skills and for what you know about engineering. Now Branca,
we expect you to try hard. You have to do your best for Connie,� she
says and I knew that I must and I knew that I would. 

&nbsp;

I started to cry again
because I did not want to leave. It was safe there with Connie. If I did as she
said and I was happy with doing what she said then all was well, I could manage
things there. I looked at Doctor Jordan. �Will&nbsp;I ever see you again? Or
Connie?�

&nbsp;

The Doctor looked
sympathetically. �Yes, Branca. If you are ill, I will look after you and when
your Owner goes away, perhaps you can stay here with us again. So what will you
do Branca?�

&nbsp;

I knew what to say. �I
will do my best for Connie,� I said and Connie and the Doctor smiled. I
heard that phrase so many times in my training. I know when I hear it that I
must do exactly as I am told.&nbsp; 

&nbsp;

�Well done, Branca! That�s
right,� said the Doctor. She placed a metal collar round my neck. I ran my
fingers across the cool titanium. I could barely feel where the too halves
joined. There was no screw or catch that I could feel. I could think of no way
in which I might release it..� Even if I
wanted to. She fitted a belt around my waist, a metal plate that runs down
across my sex, two heavy chromed chains that run from that behind and around my
buttocks up to the belt.� The fit is
perfect for it really has been made for me. I explore the belt with my fingers.
I could tell that I would be able to use the toilet but I could not console
myself at all. My only consolation would be that I will do my best for Connie.

&nbsp;

Part 3 :
Branca�s Owner

&nbsp;

They brought me here in
some kind of van or truck. The first I knew was when they came to my cell with
the straps and the gag and the hood. They didn�t say anything. But then they
never do. They just started putting the things on me like they were wrapping up
a parcel. Wrists strapped, ankles strapped, knees strapped. Then the gag. At
least it was a plug gag with a padded strap over my mouth. I hate the ball gags
and the ring gags are even worse � but maybe that�s because of what they
usually want to do when they put a ring gag on you.

&nbsp;

Then the hood. I can
still remember the smell of the leather and the feel of the thick pads over my
eyes and ears, the terrifying sense of blindness, the disorienting muffling of
every sound.

&nbsp;

I felt myself lifted
and put down again. On something unsteady. One of the trolleys, I guessed.
�Ready for shipment?� I heard a voice say. �Sure,� said another. �Sign here,
then,� the first replied. And then I was moving. I didn�t seem to stop moving
until I got here and the straps and the hood came off.

&nbsp;

It was quite a shock
when I saw her. I suppose I expected a man. I mean I suppose it�s just
prejudice but that�s what you would think, isn�t it? 

&nbsp;

But it wasn�t a man. It
was a woman that took off the hood and the straps. A woman that told me that
she was my new owner. A woman that said I had to do as she said if I was going
to do the best for Connie.

&nbsp;

What about her? Well,
surely a woman slave owner would be glamorous? Desirable, like Connie? I was
wrong. She wasn�t. �Mistress,� she makes me call her but �Daphne� is her name.
I don�t understand her. She seemed successful. She was obviously wealthy. Her
house was very nice. But she was not happy.

&nbsp;

She seems very � well
closed off, I cannot tell what she is thinking, what she is feeling. If she
feels at all. She can be kind. She took time to explain just what she wanted
done and just how she wanted it done. I knew from my training that I had to do
it. It�s what Connie would have wanted. Mistress reminds me about that. 

&nbsp;

Of course she punishes
me. She beats me if I do things wrong. She keeps me in chains and locked up but
I know that is what a Mistress must do with her slave. I know that is how a
slave must live. That is what they taught me; that I must do my best for
Connie. 

&nbsp;

For working during the
day she keeps me naked apart from hospital scrubs and rubber flip flops. It
isn�t very glamorous but it is practical for the cooking and cleaning. Oh, and
the chains and the collar and the chastity belt of course. In the evenings she
liked to dress me up; corset, high heels. She�d obviously got a thing about my
figure. When she touches me she�s as likely to play with my waist as my breasts
or my backside. She doesn�t work me too hard. It�s quite a big place but it
doesn�t take to long to clean. It�s just the two of us and she�s not
unreasonable about things the way that some owners I�ve been told about are. I
mean she�s never done the thing with the white glove to see if things have been
dusted properly. The worst part is clearing up where she�s been eating. 

&nbsp;

She came in late this
evening � I have to wait up until she tells me I can go to bed � what ever time
that is. 

&nbsp;

She�d been to some
classy event - came in wearing a strapless, long, silk, evening gown and long
evening gloves, great dangly earrings and what might have been a diamond
choker. The dress was probably a bit tighter than it should have been. You
could see the rolls of flesh under her arms spilling out over the top of the
tight silk. She flopped down on the couch looking as though she�d had too much
wine and not enough good company. A strand of hair had come lose from where
she�d had it put up; it was dangling down across her face. She scowled at me,
waving me to get some food. 

&nbsp;

I knew what she wanted.
It was what she always wanted. My legs were aching from the stilt high heels
she made me wear. She looked up from the couch, grinning. Definitely too much
wine, I thought. She asked for a beer, cheese burger and fries with extra onion
rings.

&nbsp;

I fetched her the beer
first. She crouched forward almost engulfing it, slurping the froth from the
top, leaving a foamy line along her upper lip. She fumbled putting the glass
down and splashed some on the table. She grabbed a handful of paper towels from
her handbag and dabbed ineffectually at the puddle of beer. 

&nbsp;

�Why does she do it?� I
thought. �She doesn�t need this.� I took the burger across to Mistress�s table.

&nbsp;

She�d almost fallen
asleep in her beer. �Hey,� she said, waking up with a start. �Don�t creep up on
people.�

&nbsp;

�Sorry, Mistress,� I
said quietly as I put the food down. It was the best way. She was sitting
elbows on the table. She picked up the burger in both hands, still wearing her
silk gloves, and pushed it into her mouth. Grease and melted cheese dripped
down her chin and onto her dress. A translucent stain spread from the neck line
of her dress, down across her bosom.

&nbsp;

�I dunno why I go to
those things,� she slurred. �They�re always shit and they�re full of shits. And
he�s a shit anyway. Why wasn�t he there? They don�t give a shit about me and I
don�t give a shit about them and I �.� She seemed to lose track of what she was
saying. �Where�s? Where�s my beer?�

&nbsp;

�You�re holding it
Mistress,� I said. It�s nights like that I wished she�d forget to lock the
doors so I could go back to Connie but somehow she never did. 

&nbsp;

I don�t have to do too
much for her in the bedroom which is good for me.� Well, she�s fat, and sometimes she just
smells. It�s not as though she doesn�t bathe but sometimes she just smells.
Especially up close. Especially down there. A good thing though, she doesn�t
want me to do that for her very often. And another thing, she doesn�t punish me
often either.

&nbsp;

Except last night.

&nbsp;

It started well. She
seemed really pleased when she got back. �That�s the Canadian investment
sorted,� she said. �That will clear about three million for two day�s work. Not
bad. Start supper then come back and run a bath.�

&nbsp;

It was pretty much the
same all the time. I�d get the table laid, have the food ready to serve and
then put on my corset and heels and go up to Mistress Daphne�s bedroom. She
waits while I undress her and help her into her bathrobe. She always says to
leave her clothes on the floor until she gets into her bath. It�s always a
problem � makes more work for me to clean and press them. I follow her through
into the bathroom carrying whatever she wants for the bath.

&nbsp;

Last night I was
carrying her bath towels and a tray with a glass of white wine.

&nbsp;

I helped Daphne
undress. She really isn�t anyone�s idea of the body beautiful. I mean sure she
was tired after the trip. She looked pale. Sometimes her skin looks almost
waxy. I took her robe, the flesh across her belly sags a bit, there are these
two rolls of fat and there�s plenty more on her hips too. Her hair looks lank.
There�s a shampoo for greasy hair and conditioner on the side of the bath but I
can�t remember when I last saw her use it. She�s smoking again. I can smell it
on her hair.

&nbsp;

I�m standing there in
my corset and heels. Holding the tray and towels. Then I see she�s looking right
past me. She�s looking in the mirror. There�s a big mirror panel on the back of
the bathroom door and she�s looking at it. There�s me in corset and heels, I�ve
still got the tan from the summer in Porto before I came to London; my hair is
neat - I like it to look good. It�s not a look I�d choose but I try to look
nice. That�s what Connie taught me and I have to do my best for Connie. I think
Connie would like how I look. And then there�s her. I look at her and I think,
�You�re what I lost my freedom for? Why couldn�t I stay with Connie?�

&nbsp;

I guess she saw the
look on my face. Any other time it would have earned me a beating but now it
was like someone stuck a pin in her and let all the air out. She just slid down
to the floor of the bathroom, her back against the bath. She was crying and
waving her hands at me. �Look,� she said, �look at you and look at me.�

&nbsp;

�What do you mean,
Mistress?�

&nbsp;

�Look, look at me, I�m
just so, so, disappointing. All that work, all that money, all that effort. For
what?�

&nbsp;

�You�re tired
Mistress,� I said.

&nbsp;

�Yes,� she said. �Tired
of all of it. Tired of being like this.� And then she beat me. She grabbed me
by the hair and dragged me across the edge of the bath. She used the back of
the bath brush and she just kept bringing it down on my backside, over and over
again. Until she slid down beside me sobbing. �Get OUT!� she shouted. �GET
OUT!!� I was glad to leave her. 

&nbsp;

Part 4 :
Daphne�s Epiphany

&nbsp;

I left her for a while.
I found her sitting in the lounge and took her a tray with her meal and some
more wine.

&nbsp;

�Thank you, slave,� she
said. I think she was feeling a bit remorseful about how she�d treated me but
of course she didn�t apologise. �Stay here,� she waved for me to kneel beside
her. She didn�t seem interested in food for once but she gulped down the wine.
She turned on the TV and started flipping through the channels. Too much
choice. 50 channels of nothing. Well, even I can�t find anything to watch on it
when she�s out and the alternative is working my butt off.

&nbsp;

The channel changing
stopped. It was just another lot of adverts. How many personal loans does
anyone need? The screen changed. �International Athletics � Live From Melbourne
- The 2006 Commonwealth Games,� the caption said. Daphne reached for the
control but it fell from the arm of the couch. I went to get it for her. When I
turned back she was staring at the screen, captivated. There was a girl
standing, hands on hips, behind the starting blocks of the track. Now, I�m not
into girls. I do what I�m told in that direction of course but it�s not my
thing. I could see though that you could think this girl was hot. She was
beautiful, strong, fit and sexy all at once. She drew her hair back, fastening
it in a pony tail behind her in a final ritual before taking her place on the
blocks.� The camera drew back, five
others were crouched in the blocks. A horn blew. Six bums pushed up tense as
the girls waited for the gun. The crack of the pistol launched them down the
track. 100 metres of intense effort. The look of self assurance and power. The
grace in the way she stretched as she breasted the line barely millimetres in
front of the other competitors. And then the smile of triumph, the combination
of extreme pleasure and exhaustion, her body�s entire resources exhausted in
just a few seconds. 

&nbsp;

�Should I change the
channel, Mistress,� I said. �There will be financial news on Bloomberg.�

&nbsp;

�No,� said Daphne,
studying the screen with an intensity I had never seen before, �leave it.� 

&nbsp;

She watched another race
and another. The programme switched to the high jump and then the javelin.
Daphne sat fascinated. The commentator said, �And now the leaders in the
marathon are approaching the stadium. Kerryn McCann of Australia and
Helen Cherono Koskei of Kenya � The camera cut to a view of the road outside.
There were just two runners, one white and the other black, still virtually
neck and neck after almost 26 miles. Other runners could be seen some distance
behind them, pressing on, trying to close with the leaders in the last quarter
mile as they came closer to the gates of the Melbourne Cricket Ground. 

&nbsp;

The leading girl
glanced back over her shoulder and responded, kicking out and pulling away with
a smile on her face that said, �Maybe I�ve done 26 miles but so have you and
I�ve still got something left.�� As they
entered the stadium there was an enormous roar from the crowd and the white
runner, a short rangy girl in a yellow vest and sunglasses, began to edge
ahead. The caption on the TV screen read �Kerryn McCann, Australia� The big
display screen at the far end of the stadium was ticking away the seconds as
she approached the line. 2:30.52, 2:30.53, 2:30.54. She crossed the line and
slowed, waving to the crowd. Well outside a world record time but pretty good nonetheless.
McCann had finished only two seconds in front of Helen Cherono Koskei but two
seconds was enough even after two and a half hours. The others from the leading
group followed her across the line minutes later, their pace broken by the
drive of the first two. �Impressive performance,� said the commentator, �from
the thirty eight year old mother of two and a great repeat of her 2002
performance in Manchester.�

&nbsp;

Daphne sat watching
intently, her mouth half open, apparently stunned by what she had just seen.
She became aware that I was watching her. She looked at me and scowled. �Get
out,� she said. �I shan�t need you tonight.� I went to bed, feeling as lonely
as Daphne seemed to. I took off my corset and heels but of course my collar and
chastity belt stayed on. I fell asleep and dreamed of Connie.

&nbsp;

Two days later the
equipment arrived. The running machine, the exercise cycle, the weights.

&nbsp;

�This,� Daphne
announced to me, �is going to do it. I�m going to be fitter. I�m going to loose
weight. Just watch.�

&nbsp;

It all looked like
top-of-the range equipment to me. I guess she started out with the best of
intentions. It didn�t seem to work out too well though. Two days after it was
all installed she had a TV put up in the room. She didn�t seem to get on with
the running machine, she spent a lot of time sitting on the cycle watching TV
but it looked to me like she was just going through the motions. Yesterday I
saw her there, pedalling slowly, with a cigarette in one hand and a doughnut in
the other. I don�t know much about fitness programmes but I�d be surprised if
any of them involve that.

&nbsp;

She was in a bad mood
when she weighed herself that evening. �What a waste of money,� she snarled.
�Two and half grand and I haven�t lost a pound!�

&nbsp;

She took it out on me
of course. With a riding crop this time. I�m getting used to that. The crop,
the belt, the brush. The wheals, the cuts the bruises. It�s hard to bear but I
know I must do my best for Connie. It didn�t help when I said that maybe she needed
to talk to someone who knew about the exercise business.

&nbsp;

The
Clerk�s Tale

Part 1 : Lunch
on the Town

&nbsp;

It�s not often we feel
the need to turn down a commission. I take a pride in the research we do and I
get involved in almost every operation one way or another. I can�t remember the
last one we turned down. I�m Rick, by the way. I look after the Research
Division for Clegg Enterprises. We trade women, but I guess you knew that
already.

&nbsp;

I was with Larry, our
marketing man, in a restaurant at the top of a hotel overlooking Hyde Park.
He�d asked me to go along with him for a meeting with a client. �It�s a woman,
Daphne Challis,� he said. I must have looked interested. Actually, I just
recognised the name. Larry had us do a report on her a while back. �Don�t get
our hopes up,� he said. �If there was her and a horse in the bar, you�d be
looking at the horse!

&nbsp;

�That rough?� I said.

&nbsp;

Larry nodded.

&nbsp;

It was a pleasant day
in mid march. Our table overlooked the hotel roof garden and the park beyond,
where the plane trees were just starting to push out leaves in anticipation of
summer.

�

I saw what Larry meant
about Daphne when she joined us. She sort of waddled in, wearing a skirt that
stretched across her belly, a sweater that looked two sizes too small and pair
of shoes that looked as if they cost more than some cars.

&nbsp;

The restaurant was a
better venue than most of the places I lunch in.� Green Stuff was a new place, built to cash in
on enthusiasms for better food and healthier eating. Both the prices and
portions were calculated to slim you down! 

&nbsp;

�Larry,� Daphne said,
when he broke the news that we didn�t want the job, �what�s so difficult about
it?�

&nbsp;

Larry shrugged.

&nbsp;

Daphne persisted. �I
need a personal trainer. Someone who can help me with getting fit. You must
have someone like that on the database.�

&nbsp;

I pushed the leaves
around my plate. What had been billed as �Country Life� on the menu had turned
out to be a mixed green salad. I was missing some carbohydrates, the one thing
I�d expected from lunch with Daphne, after what Larry had said, was that it
would involve chips. Daphne reached over and poured some more carrot juice into
my glass. Larry looked impressed. I guessed it was the first time he had ever seen
her help someone else to some food. 

&nbsp;

�I can check but I�m
just not sure it�s a smart idea,� Larry said. �Look � its going to be a
challenge to find someone that will be right but of course we can do that with
a bit of effort. Rick here can find something, I �m sure.� I nodded. �The
problem will be prep.�

&nbsp;

�Hungfg?� she said
through a mouthful of salad. I took it to be a request for explanation. You
pick up useful life-skills working a lot with gagged women.

&nbsp;

�First it�s going to be
a really difficult pick up. She�ll be fit � that�s a sort of requirement �
works a lot with a lot of people, so not often on her own. Then there�s getting
her controlled � athletes are really good with pain and stress so we�ll need to
come up with a whole new approach. And, well, it�s like any creative type
skill. If you discipline them enough to be a slave you lose the abilities
you were after. If you don�t discipline them well enough they�re over
the wall at the first opportunity. Plus, with a
trainer, they will have to take you out to Gyms, Tracks, Parks.&nbsp;It�s not
like you could keep them in a cage.&nbsp;They will be over the wall already! Trust me, I�ve just been through something like this with a
writer and even with all Freddie�s resources first she was difficult to hang on
to and second she was difficult to get working properly. Then your project is
going to take what � twelve months, tops? At the end of that you�ll want to
sell on and I�m telling you there has been zero requirement for anything like
this in the past so resale value is going to be nothing like what you�ll spend
in Prep costs, even. It�s a money pit project and much though I�d like to take your
cash, I need to warn you.� 

&nbsp;

She dabbed at her mouth
with her napkin. It left a green stain on the cloth but I guess that�s a hazard
if you serve this sort of food. �Larry, I�m going to have one. You know what
I�m like when I make up my mind.� She waved to the waiter and he came across.
She pointed to her plate and said, �Again.� He wandered away. I didn�t think
she quite got the hang of healthy eating.

&nbsp;

�Let me make a radical
suggestion.� said Larry. Daphne looked at Larry suspiciously. �Hire one.�

&nbsp;

�What, hire a slave?
How does that help?�

&nbsp;

�No, not a slave. Hire
a personal trainer. That�s what normal people do. You give them money and they
work for you. Sorted � and it�s cheaper, believe me.�

&nbsp;

�Hire one?�

&nbsp;

�Yes, look in Yellow
Pages. Put �personal fitness trainers� into Google. You don�t need our
database; you just need a cheque book. It�s how they make their living. You
must be hiring people all the time in business.

&nbsp;

�Hire one? But this is
a bit� ��personal.�

&nbsp;

�Hire one: Getting fit
is going to bit a bit public anyway, Daphne.�

&nbsp;

Her second plate of
food arrived. She picked at it with a fork without saying anything. She seemed
to be thinking about what Larry had suggested.

&nbsp;

�You hire one. You�re
the experts at selecting people. Find me a trainer.�

&nbsp;

�Daphne, I�d like to
help but, well, Clegg�s operation isn�t an employment agency.�

&nbsp;

�Come on Larry, do me a
favour. I�ve put business your way. I�ll pay a commission � 25% on top of her
rates whatever they are. Rick,� she looked at me, �from what I hear you could
do this without to much effort. Clegg won�t mind � put this down to account
management � keeping the customer satisfied.

&nbsp;

�Yeah,� I thought to
myself �one step ahead of the shoeshine, two steps away from the county line.�
What Larry said was, �OK, Daphne, we�ll think about it.�

&nbsp;

When I sat down with
Larry after she�d gone I must have sounded unimpressed. �You want us to
research a girl but you�re not going to pick her up?� Larry nodded. �So
overheads on collection down, operational risks down but do we make any
money?�

&nbsp;

�You heard her. Maybe
some. Sort of. Not much. Rick give me a hand, can you? Look at it like
this. The worst that can happen is you�ll have to spend some time looking at
really fit women.�

&nbsp;

�Well,� I said with
heavy irony, �in that case, I suppose I could do a bit of work for you.�

&nbsp;

I got back to him three
days later with a portfolio of half a dozen possibles. �Well that wasn�t the
worst assignment I�ve had,� I smirked. �I wouldn�t mind laying on a beach while
this lot came and kicked sand in my face.�

&nbsp;

�Thank you Arnold
Schwarzenegger,� Larry said taking the portfolio and thumbing through it. �They
all look OK to me but what do I know about it?�

&nbsp;

�Ah, there�s a science
to this you know. We�ve been very selective. One of the girls in research had
done a bit of training a while back. She used to do a bit of amateur running -
middle distance stuff. She�s worked with people like this. These are all people
that will work with beginners � some of the top trainers won�t. We�ve gone for
folk that use fairly conventional training methods and we�ve gone for those
that are easy on the eye too. Your client seems to like that.�

&nbsp;

�You have a deep
understanding of customer needs, Rick, as always.� Larry had said.���� 

�

Part 2 : A
Bicycle Ride

&nbsp;

It took us a while but
finally, we thought, we�d identified one. 

&nbsp;

My research team are
pretty good when it comes to finding the right girl. When I saw the file I was
sorry we weren�t actually going to pick her up. But then, as Larry had said,
this one was legit.

&nbsp;

She looked fit, which
wasn�t surprising. Some of these athletes can look a bit muscle bound can�t
they? Or out of proportion. Anyway, this one looked normal. In fact if
I�d been looking for fit blonde for our normal channels, she�d have been on the
list.

&nbsp;

The research report had
a lot of detail on her personal background � my team do a good job on that
stuff. Katya Izotova was our recommendation.

�

Katya was born and
brought up in Moscow. She was very much a product of what remained of the
Russian State Athletics Training Programme - it still worked in some of the
schools in spite of the disappearance of state funding. She�d been in England
about four years. She had come here, following her lover, Nicky after they�d
met in Moscow. 

&nbsp;

He was the son of a
show biz celebrity of the 1970�s, a promising athlete but not quite good enough
for the national teams. Armed with a degree is Sports Science he�d gone to
study training methods at the Moscow State Institute of Physical Education.
There he met Katya, who was also a student at the Institute.

&nbsp;

The two of them came
back to the UK as an item. Nicky had contacts in the entertainment and film
world through his father. He set up in business getting actors fit for action
movies. That led to personal training commissions. Actor clients attracted
other celebrity clients. The business grew. Katya had turned out to be a
real asset for his business, He did the promotion work and ran the business;
she did most of the training. He provided the professional credibility and the
contacts, she provided the glamour.

&nbsp;

They were doing very
nicely thank you; premium rates for their training business, more consultancy
and adviser roles lined up. There had even been suggestions from some quarters
of a cushy consultancy roll with the Olympic Games 2012 planning team.

&nbsp;

Then the roof had fallen
in.

&nbsp;

The first Katya had
known about it was when a journalist turned up at their house asking if she�d
like to comment on rumours that the US FDA were seeking to extradite Nicky on
charges of supplying anabolic steroids to US athletes. Word was that Nicky had
been operating a sideline to help his actor clients to beef up, he�d extended
that into on-line merchandising over the Internet and some US athletes had
thought that buying off-shore would avoid the US authorities. Trouble was Nicky
had overlooked the UK�US Extradition Treaty that meant he could be shipped off
for US� trial on the basis of US Government
allegations.� 

&nbsp;

With the press coverage
the clients started to vanish. Nicky felt the urge to join friends in Argentina
and Katya was left with her share in the business, financial overheads, no
clients, few friends and lots of tabloid attention. The paparazzi were three
deep every time Katya even tried to go to the shops. 

&nbsp;

The press attention
wore off when Katya developed the best strategy for dealing with them; don�t
say anything at all. In time they got bored but she was pretty hard pressed.
She still had the share in the gym that they used - they�d put it in her name
for tax purposes but that just meant financial commitments with no income. She
had no clients. They had all run a mile and quicker than any of them had ever
achieved in training.

&nbsp;

That�s when I met up
with her. 

&nbsp;

She was on a run. I was
on a bicycle. We�d thought it would be less likely to spook her than puling up
alongside her in a car. I was finding it difficult keeping up with her. �Ms
Izotova,� I called as I went to overtake her. It wasn�t very easy. We were on
an uphill slope. At least that�s my excuse.

&nbsp;

She didn�t break her
stride. �I�m not talking to the press,� she said, continuing to stare straight
ahead as she pushed her feet forward one after another in a relentless rhythm
that had me struggling not to fall behind.

&nbsp;

�I�m not the press,� I
puffed. �But I do have a business proposition for you. I�m looking for a
trainer.� I missed a gear change on the bike, practically fell off the pedals
and slipped behind her.

&nbsp;

She slowed her pace and
then stopped beside the road. She stood, one hand on her hip, the other pushing
a strand of blonde hair back from her face as she waited for me to catch up
again. As I stopped beside her she said,� You look like you need one!�

&nbsp;

I caught my breath.
�It�s not for me,� she looked like she didn�t believe me. �It�s a friend of
mine.�

&nbsp;

Katya looked thoughtful
for a moment and then shook her head. �I�m committed at the moment. Many
clients. Too much work.�

&nbsp;

�That�s not what I�d
heard,� I said, smiling. �You wouldn�t be doing road work on your own if you
had clients to run with. I�ve heard that, since the boyfriend took his trip to
South America, the business isn�t doing too well. That most of the clients came
because of him and left when he did and those that didn�t weren�t too keen on
training while trying to run with you through a crowd of paparazzi.�

&nbsp;

�The photographers have
gone now.�

&nbsp;

�But the clients
haven�t come back. Have they? Why don�t you see my friend? Talk. Maybe you�ll
hit it off. Besides you need something to do, you can�t just go on pounding the
streets until the money runs out or the Home Office remember that you came in
on the back of boyfriend persuading UK Athletics to sponsor your immigration
visa.�

&nbsp;

Katya looked
uncomfortable. I could tell I�d scored a point. �Maybe,� she said quietly. �I
could meet. No promises though.�

&nbsp;

I gave her a card from
Green Stuff. �Can you do lunch?� I said. �Tomorrow?�

&nbsp;

Katya nodded. I hadn�t
thought that she would be busy.

&nbsp;

Part 3 : Smart
Objective 

&nbsp;

Daphne turned up at
Green Stuff looking pretty much as she had when we had first met there. Katya
was already there when she arrived. She did a good job of concealing a �you
cannot be serious� as she saw Daphne at the entrance. I introduced them. I�d
told Daphne that she needed to be nice, that Katya needed persuading. It wasn�t
her default style but she managed it.

&nbsp;

�So,� Katya looked at
her prospective trainee, �you want to be fit? To feel better?�

&nbsp;

Daphne, unused to being
addressed so bluntly, nodded.

&nbsp;

�Is not enough. Anyone
can want things. Getting them is harder. You need a goal. Do you have a goal?
Something concrete, something measurable?�

&nbsp;

�I�ve thought about
that.� Daphne appeared to be warming to the Russian girl. �I like goals and
targets. I use them in my business. SMART � specific, measurable, achievable,
realistic, timed - without them you get nowhere. I have a goal. To run a
marathon. The London Marathon. Next year.�

&nbsp;

It was my turn to
conceal a look of disbelief but something about Daphne�s tone obviously
encouraged Katya. �Hmm,� she grunted. �It�s a good goal. SMART as you say.
Specific certainly. Acheivable? I don�t know. I could be unkind Ms Challis but
- looking at you now - let�s just say it�s ambitious.�

&nbsp;

�You are candid, Miss
Izotova. We can agree on that.� The two women smiled. �But let me be candid
too. From what I hear from my friend here, you need a demonstration of your own
abilities if you are to restart your business career. This could be what you
need. Besides, I will be able to cover your fees to allow you to focus
exclusively on my challenge. And I am very committed when I decide on something
I want.�

&nbsp;

Daphne�s determined
tone was something that was new to me. For the first time I got some sort of
sight of how she had made a success of her business ventures. Maybe she could
do this after all.

&nbsp;

Katya frowned again.
�So,� she said. �I train you. This is not easy for you. There will be changes.
Food. You need to change what you eat and how much you eat to change how you
feel. Exercise. Rest. Work, Cigarettes! All these need changes.� Katya folded
her hands on the table looking straight at Daphne. �But there is more.
Something which people do not consider often enough, perhaps. The psychological
aspect.� Katya tapped at the side of her forehead with her finger. �The mind.
Marathon running is the most demanding of athletic events, even for
professionals. There can be unexpected psychological burdens and changes,
particularly if they have far to go.�

&nbsp;

�I expected your
comments about the physical preparations. The others? Well, I can see they make
sense.� I am sure I am mentally resilient
enough to deal with the stresses of training,� said Daphne, returning the Russian�s
look with determination. �I am quite prepared to do whatever we need to do in
order to make this happen. You will need to see my house. I have a room we can
use as a gym but you will want changes I am sure.�

&nbsp;

�Certainly,� Katya was
content to let Daphne continue.

&nbsp;

�You will need to make
arrangements regarding your current clients. My friend here,� Daphne gestured
towards me, �can help if there any difficulties.� I wasn�t sure what that meant
but since I was pretty sure that Katya�s diary was virtually empty, I didn�t
think it would be a problem. I nodded. Katya shrugged.

&nbsp;

�So,� Katya said. �We
start soon. Tomorrow is Thursday. Monday I come to your house and see what we
must do to start.�

&nbsp;

Daphne got to her feet.
�That�s fine, Miss Izotova,� she said.

&nbsp;

�Please,� said Katya,
we will be working together. I prefer Katya.�

&nbsp;

�Of course, Katya. And
please call me Daphne.�

&nbsp;

�OK, Daphne,� Katya
said. �On Monday then.�

&nbsp;

�On Monday.�

&nbsp;

The two of them got up
and shook hands and headed out of the restaurant. I realised that they had left
me with the bill. It took me ages to get the money back from Larry.

&nbsp;

The Owner�s Tale 

Part 1 : Daphne gets ready

&nbsp;

This is me, Daphne. I�m
going to run in the next London Marathon. Run in it and finish it. I tell
everyone that. I�m beginning to believe it. 

&nbsp;

I was pretty pleased
with what Larry had set up. Steve Glennis had been right, Clegg�s operation
seemed to know how to handle things. The Izotova woman looked as if she could
do the job. She was due to come to the house on Monday. I cleared my business
diary for the day and told Branca she was to stay out of the way while Katya
was around. That wasn�t so hard, she�d earned some time in ropes. She�s a bit
of a bondage slut anyway. Her original trainer � Connie, I guess � must have
used it quite a bit in her training.

&nbsp;

I�d got Branca settled
down in the bottom of my closet just before Katya arrived; sleeve arm binder,
straps for her thighs and ankles, the lether hood and a rubber plug gag. She
whimpered a bit when I locked her in but I really didn�t want to be disturbed.
Katya and I sat in the lounge. I got her some coffee. She ignored the biscuits
and looked pretty disapproving when I had a couple but she didn�t say anything
at first.

&nbsp;

I took her around the
house and explained about Branca�s room. A friend of mine, I said. I thought
Katya raised an eyebrow but then I guessed she wouldn�t be very interested in
my personal life. Branca knew enough to keep quiet in the closet while we were
in the bedroom. I know the conditioning means that they won�t ever try
to do anything to escape but it�s really hard to remember that sometimes. I
showed Katya the room, down in the basement that I though we could use for the
gym. It�s actually next to a cell I can use for Branca, but I had carefully
locked the door to that room! She looked at the kit I�d bought. She
didn�t look very impressed.

&nbsp;

We went back to the
lounge.

&nbsp;

�This is going to be
difficult,� Katya said with a thoughtful look. �We have a lot to do. Your
height is � what? � one metre 70?�

&nbsp;

�What�s that in feet
and inches, five feet six?� I said. I never could get this metric stuff you
Europeans use. I can do weight though 20 kilos airline baggage � 44 pounds.

&nbsp;

�Weight?�

&nbsp;

�178 pounds say, 80
kilos.�

&nbsp;

Katya looked sceptical.
�Are you sure?� she said. �You have scales in the bathroom we could check.�

&nbsp;

I felt a bit sheepish.
�OK well maybe it�s a bit more. Last week it was maybe 182 pounds.�

&nbsp;

�Hmm,� Katya grunted.
She pulled a clip board from her grip and turned over a few sheets, looking at
a series of tables. �BMI 28.5 Let me check that.� She pulled a pair of
callipers from her bag and asked me to let her measure a fold of flesh on my
belly. She looked at the reading and checked her tables again. �Uhhuh � border
line obese.�

&nbsp;

�Hey,� I said, trying
to defend myself, �I�ve got big bones.�

&nbsp;

Katya looked at me,
scornfully. �You�ve got a big mouth and you spend too much time with it full of
food. That�s not the real problem though. Sure you have too much weight but
it�s not just food.� She was looking at my bare arms. �There�s no muscle tone.
You don�t take care of your body. Cigarettes?�

&nbsp;

�Err, maybe ten a day,�
I said. 

&nbsp;

Katya obviously didn�t
believe me. �Your aerobic capacity is poor, I am sure. There is a lot to do
diet, aerobic work, weights, and grooming.�

&nbsp;

�Katya, I�m paying you
to make me fit, not to make me beautiful.�

&nbsp;

Katya looked back at me
as if such a task would be impossible. I must have looked crushed because then
Katya looked more sympathetic. �It�s not about beauty. It�s about you liking
yourself. You can�t be fit if you don�t like what you are.�

&nbsp;

�I like me fine,� I
said, folding my arms.

&nbsp;

Katya looked squarely
back at me. �So why do you do to yourself what you do?� she said. �If you keep
on doing what you do, you keep on getting what you get. We do something new. We
do new things, you will like yourself better. Diet, aerobics, weights,
grooming. Four things. Not difficult. Now let�s look at food. Where�s the
kitchen?���� 

&nbsp;

I showed Katya the
kitchen, explained that Branca does most of the cooking � she lives rent free,
I said in exchange for keeping the place clean and looking after things around
the flat. I could see that Katya was making her own decisions about my
relationship with Branca.

&nbsp;

Katya was soon
rummaging in the pantry and cupboards in the kitchen, in the fridge and the
freezer. She was shaking her head. �Too much wrong food. Much has to go. I need
a bag,� she said. �Much has to go.�

&nbsp;

She started to pile
food up on the breakfast bar. �Hey,� I said, �is this really necessary?�

&nbsp;

Katya looked back at me
with determination. �Daphne,� she said, �the kitchen is the hardest gym of all.
Here it is too easy to go wrong. Too easy to slip back. Too much junk here.�
She picked out a pack of burgers from the freezer and tossed it onto the pile.
�You cannot run on junk. Cannot train with rubbish in your body.�

&nbsp;

I found her a plastic
bin liner. She carried on scooping things out of the cupboard and into the bag.
I hadn�t thought I had that much food in the house anyway. At the end there
didn�t seem left apart from a few vegetables � I�ve never had much to do with
them, I guess � and some pasta.

&nbsp;

Katya was standing
hands on hips contemplating the pile of food she intended to discard. �Ha!� she
said. �Is better without all these.� I was just pleased she didn�t seem to have
found the chocolate. Next up was the wine cupboard. �You don�t need this
Daphne,� Katya said, peering at the array of bottles inside. �Water, fruit
juice, vegetable juice, green tea, that�s what athletes drink. I�ll take these
for Larry � he deserves something for introducing us and if he has them you
can�t nag me for them and I won�t be tempted to hand them over.�

&nbsp;

It was odd watching her
pack up the wine bottles into a couple of boxes. If you�d said to me a few days
ago I�d be content to watch as someone took my Burgundies, my Barolo, my
Californian chardonnays, I�d have said you were mad. Somehow with Katya it just
seemed sensible. In fact, I was beginning to feel that the relationship an
athlete has with their trainer must be a bit like Branca�s relationship with
me. 

&nbsp;

�Cigarettes?�

&nbsp;

Reluctantly I handed
over a pack of two hundred Camels that I�d been working my way through. Living
without those was going to be difficult.

&nbsp;

�Now, we�re going to
start a diet. You say Branca does the cooking? I need to talk to her. Can she
be here tomorrow?�

&nbsp;

I was a bit worried
about Katya meeting Branca and I guess it showed. Katya jumped to the wrong
conclusion however.

&nbsp;

�Daphne, I�m not
worried how you run your love life if it doesn�t interfere with your training
but we have to get your diet under control. Look, here is a diet sheet,� she
passed me a printed sheet with a list of meals and foods. �Get Branca to look
at this. You have to get Branca to help. This is going to be difficult Daphne.
Maybe more difficult than anything you have done. You need all the help you can
get. If Branca can, she should help.� 

&nbsp;

I nodded. I said that
Branca was quite good at doing as she was told. If I told her to use the diet
sheet, she would. Katya gave me a look that said she was drawing more
conclusions about our relationship.

&nbsp;

�Now we start with
something very easy. We�ll go for a walk.�

&nbsp;

�A walk?� I said.

&nbsp;

�Yes. A walk. It�s not
so difficult and you have to start easily. You have to get fit to be able to
get fit. You aren�t in any shape to do anything strenuous so we start with a
simple walk.�

&nbsp;

�OK,� I said getting to
my feet and turning towards the door. I looked back to see Katya had her head
in her hands.

&nbsp;

�Daphne, not like that.
Go put on something loose, something comfortable. And some flat heeled shoes �
you can�t walk far in those.�

&nbsp;

I went and looked in
the closet and checked on Branca at the same time. She looked up at me from the
floor of the closet where she sat helplessly bound. Her eyes were blinded by
her hood but she didn�t appear to be in distress. I checked her gag she was
breathing easily enough. I left her. I couldn�t find much that qualified as
comfortable but I found an old pair of jeans, a sweater and a pair of flat
shoes. When I went back to the lounge I could see that Katya didn�t approve.

&nbsp;

�You�ll need something
better than that,� she said, �but we can fix that soon. That will be OK for
now, I guess. Come on.�

&nbsp;

She led the way out of
the building and set a slow but steady pace as we walked out along the street
and down to the riverside. After five minutes I was breathing heavily, after
ten, I was running with sweat, after fifteen I was coughing and glad when we
turned the corner back to the front of the building again. I let us in and
collapsed, sweating, on the couch. I was wondering if the marathon was a
realistic objective at all.

&nbsp;

Katya was showing no
more signs of effort than if she had just walked across the room and although
we hadn�t walked far or quickly, we had walked steadily and without stopping. I
was exhausted. �Don�t worry,� Katya said. �It�s going to feel hard at first but
it gets easier.� I went to wipe the sweat from my forehead, pushing matted hair
back from my face. Katya was shaking her head. She started to rummage in her
bag. �I thought we�d need these,� she said. She pulled out a pair of scissors,
a comb and a set of hairdresser�s clippers. �Sit there, I�m going to clip your
hair back to a manageable length. If you try to work out with your hair like
that it will be plastered to your scalp and face with sweat and that�s no good
for your skin. When you�re a bit fitter we might let it grow back again.�

&nbsp;

I looked in disbelief
as she plugged in the clippers. �But�� I began.

&nbsp;

�No buts. If things are
wrong we change them. That�s how we make a difference,� said Katya and without
waiting to hear anymore she spread some papers on the floor and started. The
scissors took off great chunks of hair and then the clippers whirred as she
pushed them through what was left. The sensation of cool air on my scalp was
odd, to say the least and when Katya had finished I ran my hands through the
short hairs feeling them spiky beneath my fingers. �Tomorrow we find some
better clothes for you to exercise in,� she said. �Tonight, make sure Branca
gives you something from the diet sheet. There was pasta � have that with
tomato sauce. Make sure she measures quantities. Best to start right away.
There is much to do. Back tomorrow, ten o�clock. We�ll work more then.�� 

&nbsp;

I watched as she packed
up her bag. �Bye, Daphne,� she said. �Don�t worry, you can do it.�

&nbsp;

I felt really odd once
she�d gone. I spent ages staring in the mirror looking at the short bristle of
hair that Katya had left me with. When I went to get Branca from where she was
in the cupboard, the look on her face was one of shocked disbelief. 

&nbsp;

I told her what would
be happening. Told her that she needed to follow the diet sheet. Told her that
she needed to meet with Katya. I told her that it was all so she could do her
best for Connie. That would make sure she behaved as she should.

&nbsp;

Part 2 : Diet Plan

&nbsp;

Katya came back this
morning. Branca behaved herself, which was just as well. I had her wear some
jeans and a roll neck top to cover up her collar and the chastity belt. I guess
Katya thought she was my live-in lover, which was OK. I didn�t want to have to
explain Branca�s collar and belt, though. I just wanted to keep things simple. 

&nbsp;

Katya went through the
diet sheet with Branca and gave her a shopping list. The delivery company must
have had a surprise with the change from beef and pork to chicken, whole grain
foods and pulses. At least Branca is an OK cook, so I knew she�d make it as
interesting as she could. 

&nbsp;

Mind you it was all a
bit of a shock when Katya started to talk me through it.

&nbsp;

�Right Daphne, here�s
how this works. This is no crash diet, they don�t work or if they do they leave
you weak and that�s no good to me because you need to be strong to exercise.
So, we loose weight slowly; maybe one to two pounds a week. That way is
practical. If you try to starve yourself thin, the body guesses that it�s being
starved and cuts down&nbsp;the resting metabolic rate. So you burn food slower
and lose less weight.� I nodded. I could see that made sense. �You have too
much fat in your diet, we have to reduce that, so we use lean protein,
carbohydrates, high fibre slow digesting foods like porridge, whole grain
cereals, whole meal bread and pasta, brown rice, beans and lentils, fresh
fruit, veg. You eat little and often. That way you don�t feel hungry and you have
the energy to work out. We keep your metabolic rate high and you burn much more
of what you have eaten with less left over to&nbsp;go into the fat stores.� 

&nbsp;

�Hey,� I said, �do I
get time to do anything else but worry about food?�

&nbsp;

Katya gave me a look. A
raised eyebrow suggested to me that I�d better start taking this seriously.
Katya went on. �So, little and often, that way there�s no craving between
meals. No temptations to eat biscuits, crisps, chocolate �clairs,� Katya gave
me another look that said she knew just what I�d be off stuffing given half a
chance. �In other words no going for the sugar/fat combo. That�s what really
destroys diets. Then no big meals after 6 or 7pm unless I OK it personally. The
occasional evening do isn't the problem but I don�t want you out having big
meals every night. Change your business dinners - get the work done during the
day.� I felt like I was being pummelled. �And finally you need much more water.
What colour is your pee?�

&nbsp;

�What?� I was shocked.
It wasn�t a question I was used to being asked. Or even something I was used to
thinking about.

&nbsp;

�Your pee. When you go
to the toilet. What colour is it?�

&nbsp;

�I don�t know. I don�t
really look. Sort of yellowy brown, I guess. Why?�

&nbsp;

�You can�t be fit
unless your kidneys are flushing the body out properly and they can�t do that
without enough water. Your pee should be almost colourless. Maybe a very pale
straw colour. I�ll want to check. Take a glass next time you go and bring me a
sample. You�ll need to take a couple of glasses of water as soon as you wake up
and then a couple before a meal. You need about five litres a day and,� she
said guessing what I was about to claim, �wine doesn�t count!�

&nbsp;

I guess I looked
disappointed and embarrassed and I was. Katya ignored my concern and pressed
on. �Then we change the lifestyle things. It�s not your food that make you fat,
it�s your life that makes you fat. To change your weight you have to change
your life. We need organised meal times, cut out eating to cure boredom � well,
you�ll have plenty to do so there�s not much risk of that � no more eating at
the TV and we�ll take time eating too. You eat too fast.�

&nbsp;

�And you talk too
fast,� I cut in. I felt overwhelmed by the detail and all the do�s and don�ts.

&nbsp;

Katya stopped for a
moment and then grinned. �Sorry,� she said. �It�s just that I know this works
and I know you can do it. You�ve already made the commitment to yourself we
just have to set the goals, establish priorities so you can do it and get on
with it. It�s not as hard as it sounds and it�s actually quite addictive once
you get started.�

&nbsp;

I took a glass to the
toilet and brought a sample back for Katya. It was probably the most
humiliating thing I have ever done and I stood watching as she peered at the
amber liquid disapprovingly. She sighed and gave it back to me. �Lots of water,
lots of water,� was all she said.

&nbsp;

We left Branca to
finish off in the house and Katya took me to buy some training clothes. It was
funny, I�m used to turning up at restaurants or shops and having the staff
recognise me. This way it was the other way around. Katya was obviously known
to the people in the first shop we went to, the guy that came to serve us said
he was sorry about what happened to her boyfriend and how he was glad that her
clients were standing by her � he nodded at me.

&nbsp;

Katya said thanks and
asked him to get a selection of track suits, exercise tops and shorts. I tried
some on, surprised at how comfortable it felt and how it made me feel � well �
serious about it all. We picked out some underwear that Katya said would work
better when we were exercising and a pair of trainers that cost more than the
last pair of evening shoes I bought. Katya had me try them on and then walk up
and down so she could see they would be all right when I was working out. She
then had me go outside the shop to try and run in the shoes. I had to go
through this with several different kinds before she was satisfied. I felt a
bit odd parading for her. I guess Branca must have felt the same when I first
insisted on seeing her in corset and heels.

&nbsp;

I kept the training
gear on. Katya bundled up my other clothes and asked the shop to send them on
with the rest of the things. Then Katya took me over to the gym, showed me the
equipment and introduced me to some of the folk there. It was odd, everyone was
really friendly. Nobody said they thought that what I was trying to do was
ridiculous. Nobody even seemed that bothered that I looked pretty unfit and
overweight. They just seemed happy to let Katya and me get on with things as we
wanted to.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Part 3 : Breaking Training

&nbsp;

I was sitting in the
bedroom, getting my breath back after another brisk walk � longer this time and
quicker. I pulled out a chocolate bar from the box I had hidden under the bed
and I�d just managed to gulp down a bite when I heard Katya coming in.

&nbsp;

�Daphne, there�s some
green tea in the kitchen and� Hey? What�s going on?� she said. 

&nbsp;

�Going on?� 

&nbsp;

�Daphne, don�t try to
fool with me. You weren�t performing well today and you�ve got chocolate around
your mouth. I don�t think that�s on today�s diet sheet is it?�

&nbsp;

I looked embarrassed
and tried to bluster about needing an energy boost or something.

&nbsp;

�Not good enough,
Daphne,� Katya chided and before I could stop her she bent down and pulled the
box from beneath the bed. The only problem was that it didn�t just have
chocolate in it. �Disappointing,� said Katya as she pulled the bag of chocolate
bars from the box. As she did so a couple of packs of cigarettes fell out too.
The fact they were Camel Nummber 9�s didn�t cut any ice with Katya. She was
about to tear me off a strip when the pair of handcuffs fell out as well.
Giving me a quizzical look she rummaged in the box some more, finding a
vibrator, a leather hood, some wrist and ankle straps and a ball gag. �I see,�
Katya started, �this explains some things. You are tired to death. I can tell; you
have bags under your eyes. You aren�t making the progress you should.�

&nbsp;

�What do you expect
with all this exercise and no food?�

&nbsp;

�That�s not the
problem. You don�t have balance in your life yet. You need a better balance.
You have to do your work. You have to do your training. You have to stay off
cigarettes and alcohol and you need at least ten hours sleep every night. And
sleep is not reading in bed or watching TV or playing with Branca. I guess she
wears these?�

&nbsp;

I nodded. Things were
getting complicated. 

&nbsp;

�Well, if Branca is
used to doing as she is told, she can help me to help you. All right?�

&nbsp;

I wasn�t sure I liked
the direction things were going but, embarrassed at being caught with the
chocolate and cigarettes and at Katya�s other discoveries, I nodded. Katya
called Branca in. She looked worried when she saw the toys from under my bed,
concerned that perhaps she was about to be admonished for some mistake in
tidying up. Katya reassured her. �Branca, don�t worry. I don�t mind what you
and Daphne get up to. My boyfriend and I used to do some kinky stuff too. These
things can help us to help Daphne though. What I want you to do is to put this
hood on Daphne at ten o�clock each night and put her to bed. To make sure she
stays there you strap her wrists and ankles to the bed frame. I am guessing you
know how to do that.� I was a bit concerned by the enthusiastic way in which
Branca nodded. I tried protesting but Katya and Branca ignored me. �If she
needs to get up in the night for the toilet you can take her.� But the hood stays on with the eye pieces
closed. And it stays on until I call in the morning to pick her up for
training. All right?� Branca nodded. Katya turned towards me. �And,� she added,
�if you can�t stay off the chocolates and cigarettes we�ll start using the
ball-gag too.� 

&nbsp;

I felt really
uncomfortable with this for two reasons. Firstly I�m a top. I�ve always been a
top. Even before I owned slaves I was a top. When I played cowboys and Indians
as a kid, somehow it was the cowboys that ended up tied to the tree not the
little Indian squaw that was me. Secondly I wasn�t sure how Branca�s
conditioning would cope with something like that. But I didn�t want to have
either of those conversations with Katya, so I said, �All right,� when she
asked if I was prepared to go along with her ideas.

&nbsp;

I managed to call Larry
to check on the conditioning after Katya left. I missed out the detail about
the discipline hood but once he�d stopped laughing he said he thought it would
all be OK provided I reminded Branca that this was all part of her doing her
best for Connie.

&nbsp;

So when, at ten o�clock,
Branca arrived in the lounge holding the straps and the hood and I knew I had
to get to bed. �It is time, Mistress,� she said. �I expect you want me to get
you ready now.�

&nbsp;

I tried to put as firm
a face on it as I could, feeling that I wanted Branca to know she was being
ordered to do this by me, but I still had my reservations. �Yes. Yes, you are
quite right,� I said. �You know you need to do this if you are to do your best
for Connie.�

&nbsp;

Branca looked a little
blank for a moment as she always did when I used those words but then she went
on, �I should fit the hood now, Mistress,� Branca said. I looked puzzled. �Miss
Katya said there would be less distraction if I put your hood on straight away
and then helped you to the bedroom and undressed you. So you get to prepare for
sleep from now.�

&nbsp;

My biggest concern was
that Branca went on doing as she was told, so I didn�t like to contradict
Katya. �Very well, Branca, you had better do just that,� I said. I let her fit
the hood. It was a peculiar sensation because, although I had worn hoods and
masks before my hair had always been quite long previously and now I could feel
the tightness of the leather across my entire scalp as Branca pulled the straps
and laces tight.

&nbsp;

�This way please,
Mistress,� Branca said, taking me by the hand and leading me through to the
bedroom. I stood passively while she took my clothes from me, a very curious
sensation at once submissive, because of the hood, and dominant, because of the
way in which Branca was serving me. Once I was naked, Branca helped me into bed
and fastened first my wrists and then my ankles, spread out to the corners of
the bed frame. There was plenty of slack in the chains but there was little
doubt that I would be unable to leave the bed. I felt the soft cotton of my
duvet as Branca pulled it over me. �Good night, Mistress,� she said. �There is
a bell by your right hand if you need me. Now you must sleep.�

&nbsp;

A moment later I heard
the click of a light switch and the clunk of my bedroom door closing. I was
alone.

&nbsp;

In the dark, without
sensation other than the duvet against my body, the tightness of the hood and
the pull of the straps at my wrist and ankles, it took what seemed like forever
until I fell asleep. But then that was it. The next thing I was aware of was the
sound of Branca and Katya talking. �So she was no trouble,� I heard Katya say.

&nbsp;

�No, not at all.� It
was Branca�s voice this time. �I came back at about quarter past ten and she
was asleep already by then.�

&nbsp;

�That�s good. Well it
is time for her to exercise now. You�d best get her up and get her into her
track suit and trainers.�

&nbsp;

I felt my ankle straps
being unfastened. �Come along, Mistress,� said Branca�s voice. �It is time to
get up.� 

&nbsp;

Once she had freed my
wrists, I peeled the sweat soaked hood off. The skin on my face and scalp felt
sensitive as though the light of the day was pressing onto it. I watched as
Branca busied herself, tidying away the restraints. There was no sense that she
had thought anything of the proceedings other than that she was doing as she
had been asked. Doing her best for Connie. 

&nbsp;

Katya said we�d start
the day with a walk. She had Branca fix me a green tea while I dressed. I sat
sipping it while Katya explained what we�d be doing.

&nbsp;

�So, Daphne, today we
start in earnest. I know you have your business to do and bills to pay but our
work has to follow a regular regime. If you establish a pattern then it is
easier to keep things up. So here is what we do. Morning we start with walk
then build up to runs. This will increase your metabolism so you will burn food
more lose weight and grow strength in your legs. Then you have breakfast and
work. Noon we do weights work and upper body strength. Branca will do lunch for
you here � no more restaurant food for the time being. More time to work after
lunch. Five o�clock gym for more aerobic work. Then back here for dinner and
bed.�

&nbsp;

�Hey when do I get to
have some fun?�

&nbsp;

�The training is fun.
You will enjoy that. When we see how you progress then we may change things.
OK?�

&nbsp;

�Yes, sure,� I
responded. I liked Katya�s no-nonsense approach, her breezy, confident manner.
It was just the sort of style I liked in the people I worked with. Let�s get on
with things, it said, get things done! My only reservation was that maybe she
was taking charge a bit too much. I needed to make sure Branca remembered who
was her Mistress and I needed to make sure Katya knew who was the employee and
who was the boss. But there would be time for that later.

&nbsp;

Part 4 :
Progress 

&nbsp;

That was how it
started. I think Katya and I got on really well. It was almost like the first �
well � friend that I�d had. Of course she�s a bit bossy and while the business
with the night time hood and straps seemed like a bit of a joke at first, it
has become a part of the regime. Branca got all too amused by it in the early
stages and I�ve had to give her a few thrashings just to remind her of what�s
what but now we�ve got things running (if you�ll excuse the expression) nicely.

� 

So after the first day
my diet was carefully controlled, the booze was completely replaced by water
and green tea, and the exercise programme was the only thing I had time to
think about in between work and keeping Branca in order. 

&nbsp;

Katya introduced a
proper plan of weight training.�� It
helps to be �cross training�, she says. If we just run I only get to work my
legs and lungs the weights mean I work my body.�
It gives us a change in the routine and I find it quite &quot;intoxicating&quot;
once we really get into it. I mean we aren�t talking a good claret here but
it�s got its own high. Katya said the work with the weights helps build up
strength and stability in the core muscles of the stomach and back and chest.
Katya said that helps my �running economy� plus shoulders, neck and arms are
all in motion when running and get tired if they are out of condition.

&nbsp;

The more we did of the
weight training the more weight I lost. If anything that seemed to get the fat
off quicker than the running. Katya said it was because I was upping my
metabolic rate, burning calories faster than I�m taking them in.

&nbsp;

The other thing that
happened was that Branca became a whole lot friendlier. It used to be a real
fight to get her to go down on me, a real battle of wills even though she was
well schooled in that as part of her prep. Then it was different. She seemed much
more affectionate and much keener to play with my body. I didn�t blame her;
even to me it looked better. It was nice.

�

Katya wanted me to get
more&nbsp;active generally so, in addition to the training, I was supposed to
take the&nbsp;stairs instead of the lift, get off the tube one stop early and
walk the rest of the way. Walk up a floor or two to speak to a colleague rather
than sending an e-mail. That made things a bit strange at work they thought I�d
turned into some kind of health freak but I didn�t care, it was better than
some of the other kinds of freak they used to think I was. �I even had one of the guys at work complement
me on how my exercise routine was obviously having a beneficial effect and
would I like a drink sometime?� I turned
him down, mind. That was a complication I could do without.

�

Katya&nbsp;got really
bossy in the gym where weights are concerned. �First we worry about getting
muscles in shape,� she said. �Worry about technique, don�t worry about the
weight. Your muscles, tendons, ligaments, joints all need to get accustomed to
the new work load. We build overall strength, but keep development in balance,
better endurance, better cardio-vascular fitness.� Ha! The first time we did
anything we stopped after half an hour. I could hardly lift my arms&nbsp;past
horizontal - and we hadn't really done that much!&nbsp;

&nbsp;

But after a while you
get into it. Soon I knew all the equipment and how it works your muscles.
Katya�s exercises alternate between the major muscle groups, it�s all very
ordered and structured. I have to try for full range of movement and keep
worrying about the technique. If I can't achieve that, the weight is too heavy.

&nbsp;

So that�s what we did.
Gym three times a week. Work-out time 45 minutes plus the warm up and cool down
and stretches. She insisted I rest for 45 - 60 seconds between each set. We
went around the circuit of exercises twice. Rest for 2 minutes between each
circuit. Keep the tempo; lift to a count of two - lower to a count of three. It
got to be like a mantra. I can do it in my sleep. I dream it in my sleep.

&nbsp;

Then she started on the
road work. Walking slow became walking briskly. That first sweating and
wheezing mile walk became easier, then three miles, then six, then eight, then
ten. I didn�t really notice when we started running. �Hey Daphne,� Katya said,
�lets just jog for a minute and walk another five to recover.� and this was
repeated and repeated. The walking bits got shorter, the jogging bits got
longer. We got back one day and Katya said, �You know that last run, Daphne? That
was 5 kilometres � three miles.� And I really hadn�t realised. 

&nbsp;

Three miles became
five; five became eight; eight became ten. Passing each milestone gave me a
real high and Katya was really supportive. �Another mile,� she�d say. �Well
done!���� 

&nbsp;

As I became more used
to running, Katya began to modify my running training. We always take one long
run each week, but during the week she varied my other running quite a bit. One
day we would keep changing pace; then another day we would run off-road in one
of the London parks; another day� we
would do slow/faster/fast intervals. 

On another day we�d do
hills. You probably think London is flat. Well in parts it is and in parts it
certainly isn�t. Katya seemed to know all the hills personally. They probably
sent Christmas cards to each other. Sometimes we would tackle small hills
several times. Then we would tackle large steep hills once and then maybe once
more. 

&nbsp;

Gradually, my �form�
and my stamina improved out of all recognition and with increasing strength, the
long runs became longer. I found they were becoming more enjoyable, too. 

&nbsp;

I was amazed. My weight
fell steadily; my BMI slowly approached what it should have been, and it was
all down to Katya. Well and me, a bit, I suppose. 

&nbsp;

Katya was just as bossy
about food; even though I was losing weight steadily, dropping it off at a
couple of pounds every week. She had me keep a food diary (well, actually it
got to be one of Branca�s tasks). �Eat when you are hungry, not when the clock
says so. Eat a little, often rather than a lot with big gaps between,� she
said. �Don�t eat out of boredom, find something else to do instead. Don�t bury
your emotions in food, deal with problems some other way.� She could go on for
ever about it. In the end it was easier to control the eating than it was to
turn off Katya�s nagging. �Don�t wait for meal times. Don�t put off eating if
you really are hungry but know the difference between hunger and desire.� (food
isn�t the only place I have trouble with that one.)

�

But when it comes to
desire there was a whole other problem. Mainly, I felt really horny. And I mean
all the time. Poor Branca was getting the worst of it. She was being called to
perform most evenings and given the fact that Katya has got practically every
minute of the day divided up between work and exercise, I was having to sneak
Branca off for a quickie whenever I could grab a moment. The poor girl�s tongue
was getting worn out. I can�t remember when I�ve wanted sex so much.� But then as Katya had said, �don�t eat out of
boredom, find something else to do instead�!

&nbsp;

And, as if that wasn�t
enough of a problem, I began thinking that Katya�s kinkiness was a bit more
extensive than she had let on or maybe she�d just always sublimated that in
training and coaching. I mean the thing with the hood and the straps was one
thing and her general bossiness is another but now she�s started wanting to
take photographs of me. And not just snaps. After each of our weight sessions
in the gym she has me stand naked and then takes a series of photographs. One
from the front, one from the back and one from either side. I asked her why.
She said it was so she could see my progress. Each week she put the latest one
up on the door of my fridge, alongside pictures of female bodybuilders, telling
me that was what I was aiming for. In the gym room at home she pinned them up
one after another along the wall. Goodness knows what Branca thinks about it
all.

&nbsp;

It all seemed a bit
odd, but I didn�t think too much about it at the time. I was just caught up in
the whole training cycle.

&nbsp;

Then I got a fright. I
was getting dressed after one of the sessions in the gym. As I went to fasten
my skirt I felt something hard under my hand, beneath the skin over my navel. I
panicked, rushing off to find Katya. �Quick,� I said, �I�ve got a lump. Feel!�
I grabbed her hand and pushed it against my belly.

&nbsp;

She felt carefully
across my stomach. I was really scared. Katya looked very serious. �Hmm,� she
said gravely, �I think I know what this is.�

&nbsp;

�What is it? Do I need
to see a doctor?�

&nbsp;

�Well,� said Katya,
�it�s not a rare condition but it is unusual to see it like this.�

&nbsp;

�What is it? Katya, I�m
scared.�

&nbsp;

Katya, seeing my
anxiety, relented. �It�s muscle, Daphne. What you can feel beneath the fat is
muscle. Don�t worry, it was there all along. It�s just that now that it�s doing
some useful work it�s firming up. You�ll find that you�ve got quite a few of
them.� 

&nbsp;

She laughed and I did
too.��� 

&nbsp;

She went on taking
photos. With a private client in her private weights room � she said it was too
good an opportunity to miss. As time went on I could see I was making progress,
clearly visible in the growing portfolio of photographs on the gym wall. My abs
made a modest appearance, peeping out from underneath the blanket of tummy fat
which had hidden them for so long. My shoulders and arms have got firmer. 

&nbsp;

And something else I�ve
noticed. As we�ve worked on my pectorals, my breasts have become more pert.
Needless to say, I�m not the only one that�s noticed. More things to worry
about at work!

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Part 5 : Getting In &amp;
Getting On

&nbsp;

The other thing I
hadn�t realised was how hard it was going to be to actually get on to run in
the London Marathon. We had to start that almost as soon as I started training.
Katya went through what we�d have to do. Katya could get a place as an elite
athlete but that wasn�t the problem. It was me.

&nbsp;

�But Katya,� I said,
�Thousands of people run. How hard can it be to get in?�

&nbsp;

�Daphne,� she said,
�last year about 100,000 applied and about 35,000 got a place. Do you fancy
those odds? They reckon if you go for the balloted places you might come up
lucky once in five years. No, getting into the race needs a plan just like your
exercise plan.�

&nbsp;

�What do you suggest?
Seducing the race organisers or the sponsors?�

&nbsp;

Katya pulled a face. Somehow
I had a vision of her sprawling on a bed, smothering a man with
poly-unsaturated spread. I giggled and she gave me one of her puzzled but
slightly disapproving looks.

&nbsp;

There�s four ways we
can get in,� said Katya. �One, you can be an elite athlete.� I pulled a face.
�Two, you can be a celebrity, someone that the sponsors think will attract
attention to the event.�

&nbsp;

�I don�t think that�s
me either,� I said.

&nbsp;

�Three, you can join
the ballot. I think we�ve already agreed that�s too chancy.�

&nbsp;

�Four, you can get into
one of the charity teams. Charities buy places from the organisers and then get
runners to apply for them. The runner raises sponsorship for the charity. I
don�t suppose you�ve got any involvement with any of the official marathon
charities have you?�

&nbsp;

I must have looked
blank. I�ve never been much of a one for giving my money or time away. I�ve
always had plenty of use for it myself.

&nbsp;

�I thought not. Look
how about this. Nicky was involved with New Start 2012. They�re promoting sport
as a way of helping reduce poverty in the East End, using the London Olympics
to give it all some focus.�

&nbsp;

�Not much poverty in
the bits of the east end I see,� I said.

&nbsp;

�You�re not looking in
the right places,� Katya replied bluntly. �Some places look worse to me than
back home in Russia.�

&nbsp;

�All right,� I said,
�if I have to be Lady Bountiful to get a run, then fair enough. How much do I
need to send them?�

&nbsp;

�It�s not quite as easy
as that. They�ll want to be convinced you�ll be raising good enough sponsorship
to make more from your place than if they give it to someone else.�

&nbsp;

�Well, there�s plenty
of folk in my office I can squeeze,� I said, �they made enough in bonuses last
year to build a new Olympic stadium. Hey, maybe, I can even get Freddie to
pitch in.�

&nbsp;

�Freddie?� Katya looked
puzzled. I remembered she had no idea of who had procured Branca or for that
matter, her.

&nbsp;

�Oh, just a business
associate,� I said. �Rick works with him.�

&nbsp;

�Well, that�s what�s
needed. Look why don�t you draw up a sponsorship plan. A bit like the business
plans you�re always telling me these companies you get involved with have. Show
how you might get the money. I�ll take it to the charity. They know me as a
runner. We should be able to swing it. How�s that?�

&nbsp;

I nodded. I certainly
didn�t have any other ideas and I had plenty of experience in drawing up
business plans. That bit was a whole lot easier than the rest of the training.

&nbsp;

Well to cut a long
story short. It seemed to work.

&nbsp;

I can�t tell you how
thrilling it was when the two envelopes turned up with the logo of the London
Marathon on the front and the confirmation inside that we�d each been accepted.
Somehow the whole thing seemed suddenly a lot more real. The furthest I�d run
at that point was 10 miles. Now I was going to do more than two and half times
that distance.

�

Katya�s kinkiness
continues to intrigue me. I guess I�ve been flirting with her, playing up to
her bossiness with the occasional fluttering eyelashes and the faux-submissive,
�yes ma�am�. Well it�s fun, I don�t think I�ve ever really had the chance to
flirt before and we�re spending a lot of time together.

&nbsp;

This morning�s session,
for instance. Katya had me working on the Smith Machine. �Squats,� she said,
�today we work on your leg muscles. This time try three sets of ten with 25k on
the bar.�

&nbsp;

By repetition six in
the third set, I was definitely struggling but I thought my technique was still
quite good. Katya insisted that I should be sticking my bum out more as I come
down before pushing back up for the power stroke. It was clearly just too
tempting for Katya.

&nbsp;

�Daphne, let�s help you
along there.� Whaap! She had found one of my riding crops from the toy box.
Whaap! It landed squarely on the sweet spot of my left buttock. Out of surprise
and trying to put distance between my bum and the crop, I moved the bar swiftly
back up in the power stroke of the exercise.

&nbsp;

�Oww!� I yelped. �I
didn�t deserve that.�

&nbsp;

�Better,� said Katya.
�Keep working! Keep technique!� She kept up the whacking whenever I looked like
flagging. She wasn�t hitting me hard but it felt pretty odd all the same. After
all I�m usually on the other end of the crop. Somehow we both got the giggles
and the session ended up with both of us laughing. �There,� Katya said, �all
you need is the right sort of discipline.�

&nbsp;

I became aware that
Branca was watching us from the door to the gym and grinning. I was guessing
that she was amused by the fact that her mistress was being disciplined. I made
a mental note to make sure she was reminded of who was the boss as far as she
was concerned later.

&nbsp;

Katya called her over.
�Branca,� she said, �take Daphne now and see she showers.� 

&nbsp;

�Hey,� I said, �I can
do that myself.�

&nbsp;

Katya ignored me,
carrying on talking to Branca. �Then can you trim her hair, give her a manicure
and pedicure and a massage. And then we�ll all have something to eat before its
Daphne�s bed time.�

&nbsp;

Branca just nodded, and
took me by the hand to lead me away. Somehow it seemed the right thing to do
just to follow. I was all just part of the routine.

The
Greenwich Tales

By Freddie Clegg
&amp; Phil Lane

The Trainer�s Tale

Part 1 : A
Conflict of Interest

&nbsp;

So this is perhaps the
most peculiar client I have had. My name is Katya Izotova and I have been now
in England for almost four years. This Daphne has been a real life-saver for me
after Nicky ran out but even so, she has been a most peculiar client.

&nbsp;

First it was strange
how she contacted me. Usually people just call but instead she gets this guy
Rick to set up a meeting. Then there�s this strange situation with her and her
live in lover; this Branca girl. Still we�ve managed to make it work and it�s
not like I had any other clients.

&nbsp;

In fact we�ve done
better than make it work. Daphne has made real progress. I hadn�t thought she
could do it but she�s proved really determined. And, I must confess that I had
a little fun with her too. She did most of her training from home and maybe I
took advantage of that a bit. We played around with some sub-dom chat and I�ve
given her a few taps with her riding crop when I thought she was slacking but
it was all part of the fun. You can�t be a trainer without liking to take the
lead in things and that goes for my personal relationships too. Maybe that was
some of the problem with Nicky. He liked getting his own way too.

&nbsp;

We�ve had a lot of fun
with it. I enjoyed training Daphne more than any of the others I�ve worked with
� she was so determined, so driven � and it made a real difference to her. When
we first met she really looked a mess, but the training made a big improvement.
And not just to her physical fitness. Before, you couldn�t imagine her getting
a date with anyone. By the time we�d got three quarters of the way through she
was telling me she was having to fend off guys in the office.

&nbsp;

It wasn�t surprising.
She looked fit, her whole body was toned and she seemed to glow with energy.
You could imagine anyone fancying her, although she�s a bit on the short side
for me. Of the two of them I fancied Branca more; that dark hair and deep eyes
reminded me of a Georgian girl I�d trained with when I first went to the Sports
Academy. I�d had a hopeless crush on her and she didn�t know I existed. And
since Nicky had gone, I�d certainly missed someone to snuggle up to in bed at
night.

&nbsp;

I didn�t say anything
to Branca. Life was complicated enough and I didn�t want to do anything to
disrupt Daphne�s training. But, after the Marathon, I thought, maybe she�d like
a change of partner.

&nbsp;

I wasn�t sure of what I
was going to do at the end of things. I�d been thinking about what might happen
after the marathon. Daphne really was a great example of what could be done.
Maybe I could re-start the training business using her as a reference. Maybe I
could persuade her to invest in athletics, using her businesses to sponsor some
new training facilities for British athletes. She had been happy enough to
raise money for New Start 2012, after all. 

&nbsp;

I did what I could to
keep her on track. I think the SM play really helped. She obviously had a
strong kinky streak and while she�s really a top, she enjoyed the theatricality
of it all and she seemed to get off on me being the domme for our training sessions
at any rate. For me that was fine, it kept her stepping up to the mark in
training. I added in a few little ideas of my own like having her wait with her
hands on her head, and thwacking her with her crop if she didn�t keep up with
her technique.� 

&nbsp;

We had some other fun
too. I�ve always liked piercings but Daphne just had her ears pierced once. I
told her she was going to get a new piercing each time she reached a milestone
in her running. One more when she did her first five mile run, one more at ten
miles, one more at fifteen miles. I liked the way she looked with her hair
cropped short and three rings in each ear. I think she found it quite sexy. She
had the same thing done to Branca. I liked that. I�d have had few more done to
her too.

&nbsp;

Part 2 :
Disappearance:

&nbsp;

OK, this isn�t funny
any more. I�d thought that the whole Daphne / Branca thing was a bit weird
although I�m up for a bit of kinky fun anyway, like I said. Sure we�ve been
playing around with those toys from under Daphne�s bed. But today I found out
that things were stranger than I liked to believe.

&nbsp;

Daphne had been at the
gym for her morning work-out and I�d agreed to meet up with her for her weekly
check up on weight, body fat measurement, heart rate, blood pressure, BMI and
the rest. She was deep in her afternoon work session; the usual round of
emails, telephone calls, video conference meetings and research work. Branca
was clearing up after lunch. She often liked to chat when I got to the house. I
was happy to spend a bit of time with her too. She seemed to never go out on
her own. Up until then I hadn�t realised why.

&nbsp;

�You have been very
good for her, you know,� Branca said as she scraped the left over food from
Daphne�s plate (something I�d never thought I would see!) into the kitchen
waste.

&nbsp;

�She�s doing all the
work,� I said. It was true. Daphne had really put her heart into it. All I had
done was to provide the framework.

&nbsp;

�Well maybe, but you�ve
kept her at it. And it�s made a big difference to me. You know before when she
was so fat and, well so, you know? It�s much easier being with her now that she
is happy with herself.�

&nbsp;

I said I was pleased it
had made a difference. All the time I was thinking that I�d be happier if she
was with me and not Daphne. It was then that Daphne bounced (yes, bounced! Who
would have thought that a few months back?) into the kitchen.

&nbsp;

�Are you ready for this
check up then, coach?� she said, smiling.

&nbsp;

�Absolutely,� I
replied, pulling myself back to the job in hand. �Get yourself off to the gym.�

&nbsp;

�Yes, Ma�am!� Daphne
replied. Ever since we�d started using the hood and wrist cuffs in the early
stages of her training, she�d kept up a sado-masochistic banter that was
playful but, at the same time, almost serious.

&nbsp;

�And assume the
position!�

�

Daphne grinned and
trotted off. �You see,� Branca said. �Happy with herself.�

&nbsp;

When I got to the room
we were using as a gym, Daphne was there, standing on the scales waiting for
me, with her hands on her head. Teasing as ever, she had stripped down to her
bra and pants. �I thought you�d want to check for muscle tone,� she said,
flirtatiously.

&nbsp;

�All right, Challis,� I
said using the rather formal tone that seemed to work well for keeping her
motivated. �Let me check your skin fold thickness.� In the early days of
training, measuring weight to calculate body mass index OK but as a person
becomes fitter they lose fat but build up muscle. The problem is that muscle
weighs more than fat, so you can�t rely on weight measurement alone. Skinfold
thickness measurement is best � but the client has to be undressed to do that!!


&nbsp;

Daphne looked down as I
checked her skinfold thickness, pinching gently at folds of skin in a number of
places. The first time I did this she thought the callipers you use to do this
looked pretty scary; now she was used to them. I did her resting heart rate and
blood pressure, noting the results on her fitness record.

&nbsp;

She had made enormous
strides and I told her so. �Daphne, I�m so pleased. If you had asked me at the
start of this if I thought you would get this far I would never have believed
it. But you�ve kept to the diet and the training plan and you are well on
track. When it comes to the marathon, I really think you will finish it, if you
keep things going as we have said.�

&nbsp;

�Thank you, Ma�am!�
Daphne smiled.

&nbsp;

�Seriously,� I said.
�It must have made an enormous difference to you. It�s changed things for
Branca, you know?�

&nbsp;

A cloud seemed to cross
Daphne�s face. �What did she say?�

&nbsp;

�Only that she was
happy at the changes she�d seen. What�s the problem?�

&nbsp;

�Nothing,� said Daphne.
�Nothing at all.�

&nbsp;

I forgot about it. We
went out for a run together. I had chosen to follow a hilly eight mile circuit
to give Daphne some periods of quite hard work. She wasn�t fast but she could
manage a steady pace. We got back after about ninety minutes �Sure she was tired but when I thought back to
the huffing and puffing there had been when on her first walk this was a real
achievement.

&nbsp;

Daphne went off to have
her shower and, a little bit later, she left for a late afternoon meeting at
her office. Branca was picking up Daphne�s discarded running kit. I thought I�d
tackle her about Daphne�s worries. It was not good for Daphne to be fretting
over things; not when she was doing so well.�
Not with the race coming towards us.��


�� 

I asked Branca what was
the matter with Daphne. �She seems edgy,� I said, �not concentrating.�

&nbsp;

�I think,� Branca said
with her usual candidness, �that she is worrying about you and me.�

&nbsp;

�Why?�

&nbsp;

�I think she believes
you find me desirable. She worries that you might want me.�

&nbsp;

I decided that honesty
was the best approach. I reached out to her. �Branca, we�ve all been very
close. I�ve been lonely after Nicky went. You�re an attractive woman. You
remind me a lot of a woman I once loved, or thought I loved. Who knows what
might happen?� Branca seemed surprised by the expression of affection.

&nbsp;

�It cannot be like
that, you see. I am for Daphne.�

&nbsp;

�But that�s silly,� I
said. �I mean you two are a great team but it�s not like she owns you, anyway.�

&nbsp;

Branca looked blank. 

&nbsp;

�I said, she doesn�t
own you.�

&nbsp;

�Yes, she does.�
Branca�s response was blunt.

&nbsp;

�Oh, I know you and
Daphne play those SM games.�


�Games? It�s no game,� she replied, as though it was the most natural thing in
the world. �Not for Daphne, not for me. She bought me, paid for me to be
brought here. Paid for me to be trained as hers. You and she, you�re the team.
I�m not part of any team. My room � why do you think it has a lock? Why do you
think it cannot be unlocked from inside? Look - see my collar. She had this put
on me. It cannot be taken off. See.�� She
slid it around her neck. I knew she always wore it but I hadn�t realised that
there was no way it could be removed. It seemed way too extreme.� She saw my horrified look. �Oh, I�m sorry. I
didn�t mean to frighten you. Look it�s all right. I do this because I want to.
I have to be like this. I have to do my best for Connie.�

&nbsp;

�Why do you say that?�

&nbsp;

�What?�

&nbsp;

�Do your best for
Connie.� 

&nbsp;

Branca looked blank.
�Do I say that? I don�t know. Maybe it was my training. You see I did training
like Daphne does training. Like you do training. Look, don�t be upset.�

&nbsp;

It was all too strange
for me. I thought back to my grandfather, Dedushka Izotov, who used to say,
slowly shaking the stem of his pipe towards me: �those Westerners: there is no
limit to their decadence!� Sexual games are one thing but real life, live-in
slaves? That�s something else. Perhaps he had been right all along ��..

&nbsp;

And then Branca said,
�Please don�t be upset. You just don�t understand what it�s like. Don�t worry
we can help you understand. You can get to see what it�s like.�

&nbsp;

I didn�t want to see
what it was like. There was no way I wanted to be involved in Daphne and
Branca�s strange household any more. I thought that Branca meant Daphne planned
to take me as some sort of slave. Suddenly I just wanted to put as great a
distance between me and Daphne and Branca as I could.

&nbsp;

I went off to the basement
to pick up my stuff from the training room. I was bending over my sports grip
when Branca crept up behind me and pulled some sort of leather bag over my
head. I was taken completely off guard and as I struggled to get the bag off,
Branca grabbed my wrist and snapped a handcuff on, pulling my arm down and
locking the other cuff through my belt. I am much stronger and fitter than
Branca, but she had taken me by surprise and she seemed to be fighting with
strength born of desperation. We both rolled to the ground. Unable to see, I
was at serious disadvantage. I tried to cry out but the noise I made was
muffled by the bag, Branca cuffed my other hand to my belt in the same
way. Finally I felt Branca catch my ankle and fasten it to the weights rack and
like it or not I was her prisoner. There was not much I could do about
anything. She pulled off the bag and jammed something into my mouth. I guessed
it was the red ball gag that I�d seen in the toy box. I couldn�t cry out and
the more I tried to struggle, the more I realised that the cuffs were locked
immovably about my wrists and I couldn�t free my ankle from whatever was
holding me. 

&nbsp;

Branca left me there.
Some time later I heard Daphne�s voice saying, �Oh, my. Oh, Branca! Why did you
do this?�

&nbsp;

�She was going to go,�
she said. �She found out about me being your slave. She was going to go. I
couldn�t let her.�

&nbsp;

�But why, Branca? We
would have sorted things out.�

&nbsp;

�No. She was going to
go. You wouldn�t have your training. Wouldn�t have your run. Maybe you�d go back
to being the old Daphne. Maybe you would be mad at me. Maybe you would send me
away, sell me to someone else. She didn�t want to be your new slave. She would
tell police, I�m sure. That cannot happen you know; not if I do my best for
Connie.�

&nbsp;

I tried to cry out but
whatever was filling my mouth cut the sound to a moan.

&nbsp;

�Oh, Branca,� I heard
Daphne say. �I�m sure you did your best. Don�t worry. I�m not going to sell you
but the question is still what do we do about Miss Izotova now.�

&nbsp;

�I can undo the
straps,� said Branca. �If I did wrong.�

&nbsp;

�No,� I heard Daphne
say, �that won�t do. Maybe she was going to go. I can�t let that happen. I
can�t lose what she�s done for me.�� I
felt her crouch down beside me. Her hand was stroking my head. �I�m sorry,
Katya, I can�t let you go. You mean too much to me. The running. How I look.
How I feel. And everything else. I can�t let you go.�

&nbsp;

Then there was Branca�s
voice again. �I brought the phone, Madam,� she said. �You should call Larry. He
will know what to do.� 

&nbsp;

I overheard Daphne�s
end of the conversation. �Larry, it�s Daphne. I need some help.��� �. �It�s about the Russian goods that you
suggested I hire. I need to convert the rental to a purchase. �.. Yes, I
realise what that will involve. �. Yes I know �.. Well, it will have to be done
quickly. �. The rest of my training and for the race. � Yes I know you need
more time to do a complete preparation job. � It doesn�t need to be too
thorough for now � Just so I can finish training and do the run. After that we
can do a proper job.� � Larry, please.
Get the team to do what they can. �. Yes you can collect from here. � I�ll
explain what happened later.�

&nbsp;

Daphne stayed with me, waiting for her
friends to arrive. I felt like a child waiting with their parents to be taken
away to hospital, except I am raging, struggling, tired and frightened. Just
what does Daphne think she is playing at? �How dare she do this to me? Then I think about
Branca. I�m going to be like Branca? Daphne thinks people are just things to be
collected and disposed of. I felt terrified. What did they do to you, these
friends of Daphne? How did you get to be like Branca? Then there were other
voices.� There was a man and a
woman.� Eva, she said she was, pushed up
my sleeve and held what looked like a fat marker pen against my arm while the
man held me steady. There was a sharp prick and a feeling of pressure and then
I began not to care anymore what was happening.�
I began to feel very tired and heavy. It was so much easier just to do
as I was asked. To keep still. To let them help me up. To go with them out of
the house. I took a last look at Daphne and Branca: It was like looking at a
painting in a gallery: I saw two frightened little girls cuddling each other
for protection.

The
Greenwich Tales

By Freddie Clegg
&amp; Phil Lane

The Runners� Tale 

Part 1: Final
Countdown 

&nbsp;

Daphne: It�s only
two days to the race. I really didn�t think I would get this far. Especially
when Katya went. The day after she was taken away, I
already knew I couldn�t cope with the training on my own. I was on the phone to
Larry, desperate, begging him to come up with something. He had called back
later.� Rick had one of his team who had
done some running. Rick was ready to let her come and help out. She knew about
Branca and the Katya problem. �Would that be OK?� he�d asked. I practically bit
his hand off. 

&nbsp;

This young, upper class, English girl
turned up at the house and introduced herself as Beth. She was pleasant enough
and had a determined smile, but I�m not sure whether she saw me as a client or
as some sort of sub to be kept on my toes. Something about the way she said
things. Maybe that�s unfair: probably it was just the way I was hearing things
then.

&nbsp;

We went through the planner in Katya�s
training diary. I found myself worrying about her, hoping she was ok, worrying
about what they were doing to her, asking myself if I�d really had to make her
go through it.� 

&nbsp;

Beth was riffling through the pages and
umm-ing and ah-ing and I was feeling irritated at the way she was picking over
Katya�s things. In the end, we agreed on three things, shorter runs during the
week, Beth was to be my companion there; longer endurance runs as Katya and I
have got to the fifteen mile point now, Beth suggested she would cycle round
and meet me at pre-arranged points on the run to let me practice taking fluids
and also the sports energy drinks to make the most of my carbohydrate stores;
third there�s the gym. Beth suggested going to the Gym with me and explaining
to anyone who asks, that Katya is not too well at the moment and is having a
few weeks off. It�s also what Beth said we would have to tell Katya when she
gets back.

&nbsp;

I started to feel sick and anxious in my
stomach. �Not-too-well�; �Having-a-few-weeks-off�; each word hurt. I felt so�?
What? Well weepy, I guess. And then Branca turned up with some of Katya�s
things she�d found while tidying up in the gym. I just looked at one of her
training shoes and burst into tears

&nbsp;

But as Katya said, you have to focus on
the training. So that�s what we did. Out in the late winter. Sometimes we
followed parts of the real marathon course; sometimes we went out to the London
Parks. One day we took a trip out to Epping Forest to do some trail running. I
had been getting on quite well with Beth and it was a really lovely day. As we
ran, my mind started to wander. Katya had told me about when she trained
running in the Russian forests and then ahead, there was this other runner
coming towards us. She was coming fast. She was blond and her pony tail was
bobbing behind her, like Katya�s. I thought, �It�s Katya! They have let her go!
We can be together again! She is OK now!��
But the girl � she just rushed past without a second glance and it
wasn�t Katya and my tears just ran and ran. Beth put her hand on my shoulder
and that was it. The end of the run. A beautiful day ended with me feeling
really low and sick with anxiety. We headed back. All I wanted to do was to go
home.

&nbsp;

It was a real relief when they sent
Katya back with six weeks to go. I�m sure I couldn�t have got this far
otherwise. 

&nbsp;

Katya: It�s Friday 20th.
April. The house is waking up. The door to my room has automatically unlocked as
the alarm goes off. I get up to find Branca has already started to make
breakfast. I briefly check our PC. It has internet access but quite restricted.
I keep meaning to ask Daphne why but I can never find the words to use �.
Anyway, I go to the London Marathon site to check for late news items. On the
home page, there is a countdown timer. 2 days, 3 hours, 30 minutes, 28 seconds,
27, 26, 25, ��. I� go through a
stretching routine and then make my way to Daphne�s room Outside I kneel down
to perform a quadriceps stretch, but strangely always feel the need to do this
after I have knocked on her door. As she opens, I lean forwards to stretch my
para-spinal muscles and kiss her feet. I cannot understand why I always seem to
do this, but Daphne does not mind, in fact she accepts it. She smiles down at
me. �We go to the Marathon Expo for final registration today, Mistress,� I tell
her. She looks excited; a little scared maybe. �I know, Katya,� she says. �I
guess it really is happening isn�t it?�

&nbsp;

Daphne: I open my
door and find Katya on her knees. The door to her room unlocks automatically. I
keep a time lock on her door at night. I feel I have to. Although Clegg�s
people say her preparation has been thorough they are still concerned that it�s
been hurried. I haven�t needed to bother for Branca but, with Katya, I guess
it�s better safe than sorry. She leans forward to kiss my feet. I look down at
my beautiful, useful, new slave. Clegg�s people have worked their magic
very well. Larry said Katya's Prep would stay intact
even when we go out together - which is kinda crucial because we are out most
of the time and so far, she&nbsp;has not given me a&nbsp;moments worry. When Harry turned up after Branca had
chained her up he wasn�t confident that he could make things work. They took her
but he said he wasn�t sure he could get her ready in time or even at all. I�d
been distraught; desperate for her to be back as soon as possible to help me
finish my training but desperate too to make sure she would stay with me. Larry
did what he could. Beth was sweet and a real help but it wasn�t the same. Of
course. But why did it have to happen? Why did we have to do this Katya? I
didn�t want to do this to Katya but I couldn�t let her go. But somehow I feel
guilty about how I�ve treated her. It�s never bothered me with any of the other
slaves I�ve had. Why couldn�t things have gone on just as they were? �Still, whatever Clegg�s people have done it
seems to have worked. Katya�s every bit as attentive as Branca. She reminds me
about Sunday. Sunday! Will my beautiful, useful, new slave get me through all
those miles? Larry said I would sell her on after the Marathon, but I don�t
think I can. I can�t imagine Katya not being around.

&nbsp;

Katya: We reach the
Marathon Expo at ExCel, in the old London Docks. There is no difficulty finding
it. The place is alive with other runners. They are unmistakeable; determined,
eager, pent-up, maybe a little apprehensive. Perhaps this is what its
like for soldiers before they launch an attack? Over the entrance is a large
plasma screen showing highlights of last year�s race and in the background
inspirational music plays, it�s a motivation in its own right. First
we go to the Registration Desk and hand our registration forms to the clerk. We
sign them and she checks the signatures on our original entry forms. She gives
us our kitbags and a sealed envelope I carefully check the contents. Do the
running numbers correspond to the numbers on our registration forms? Are the
numbers on the electronic timing chip correct? Have we got the official label
for our kit bags? Have we got the final instructions? It�s all OK. I make sure
that Daphne carefully stows all away in her bag: we are both now committed! I
breathe a sigh of relief to have the bureaucracy over and we move on to enjoy
the Expo. Daphne seems almost dazed by it all but this must be all quite out of
her experience. Up to now we have run together, just the two of us. We
sometimes met other runners but never several hundred, all in the same place,
all the same time, all sharply focused on the same goal. I know I can get her
through it. And this is something to enjoy; the fellowship of the other
runners; the feeling of a single shared purpose. And the marathon?� Ah, I�m sure I can get her through After all
I must do my best for Connie� 

&nbsp;

Daphne: The Marathon
Expo is just astonishing. First, there�s the size of the hall and it�s all
dedicated just to this one event. Second, the amazing number of people here,
there are thousands of them. Third, just looking at the other runners�. If I
was complacent before, I�m not now � in fact I�m aware of a tight knot of
anxiety in my stomach (it�s a lot smaller than it was, so a small knot feels
bigger!) Katya is trying to encourage me, telling me I look fitter than quite a
lot of the others here, saying I�ve done my training and I�ve nothing to fear.
Katya and I tour the stalls with everything you could possibly imagine you
needed for running and quite a few you couldn�t. There�s this thing on a
physiotherapy stand which is supposed to vibrate against tired muscles and
relieve pain. Seems more like something Larry�s people would be interested in.
I find myself daydreaming about the timing chips we all have to wear.
Electronically tagged.� I can see mileage
for Branca and Katya wearing tags, but me?? We spend a bit of time on the
Garmin Stand. They have a GPS which tells you how far you have been running,
how fast you went and what your heart rate was. Katya suggest we should have
them and that�s fine by me. We spend some time listening to one of the (many)
presentations and after a couple of hours we head for home but not before Katya
has fussed over our kit bags and contents once again. Well, I employed her to
be thorough. Having her taking charge of things as my Trainer was natural I
guess, but its strange now. Here she is taking charge again even though she�s
now my slave - officially.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Part 2: To
Rise From Earth

&nbsp;

Katya: It�s 6 o�clock
on Sunday morning, the 22nd of April. It�s just 4 hours to the marathon. I�m
laying awake thinking about Daphne�s progress over the past months. She has
surprised me and the major surprise is that we have reached this point
together. But I still worry. I am anxious that she completes the run and enjoys
herself. I have dreams now which always link us together. And another thing,
I�ve been going over the training programme. I just have no pictures in my mind
of the training we did from about ten weeks ago to six weeks ago. It�s odd �
because that�s a really important time, we must have been doing some long runs
and some fairly hard work in the gym but I really don�t remember it.� I looked through the training diary. Daphne
had filled it in carefully, just has she has done all along, but I can�t recall
any of it. I mentioned it on Friday as we were coming home from Registration
and Daphne said �of course I completed all the assignments� and then she said
to remember that I had not been too well for a week or two. But I don�t really
remember that either. It�s only what Branca and Daphne told me. And I thought
it was odd that she said she�d completed the assignments, she usually says �Oh,
we did that together.� So I still worry. It�s as though I can never move on to
anything else, always being brought back to Daphne by other people whose faces
I can never quite remember. Except for one. And her name is Connie. Presently I
rise and go through my stretching routine, finishing outside Daphne�s door on
my knees kissing her feet. I just cannot understand why I behave like this and
more to the point why Daphne never says anything. It�s almost as if she expects
me to behave like this. I go in to her bedroom to go through our checklist:

&nbsp;

Daphne: I only slept
rather fitfully last night and I�m glad when Katya came. Seeing her was a real
encouragement This is the day! Closing the deal. Worse: closing the deal in
front of all my sceptical colleagues who don�t believe that I will be coming to
collect their sponsorship. So there is a lot riding on today. Katya is a real
professional. Gee, I almost said a real domme. For a slave she has a lot of the
domme about her. It�s been fun for the training but I prefer it with me in
charge.� So it�s check-list time. Katya
makes me feel like Armstrong, Aldrin and Collins setting off for the Moon:-

&nbsp;

Vest - check

Pants - check

Socks - check

Shoes - check

Timing chip - check

Running number pinned to vest - check

Bum belt- check

Spare caps for sports drinks (Katya has found out they give
them out cap off) -check

Powder for toes -check

Sunblock - check

Change of clothes for after the run .Gee: there is an
�after the run� � sorry, check

Kitbag - check

Sweat shirt to keep warm on the way to the park - check

Trash bag to wear after kit bag handed in but before start
of race � check

&nbsp;

Breakfast � check. 

&nbsp;

Food used to be the
major recreation but now it�s all part of the routine. Now it�s fuelling- up
time Katya had insisted Branca repeat making our marathon breakfast for weeks.
�Never do anything on race day that you haven�t done before and gotten away
with,� she says. So it�s downstairs for porridge and milk, scrambled eggs,
toast and water. Oh boy - plenty of water.

&nbsp;

Katya: Daphne�s house
is close to Greenwich Park and the Red Start. There are three start points for
the London Marathon and they converge at two points along the course. We are at
the Red Start, in Greenwich Park itself.�
Time is now 9.00.One hour to the mass start, when we go. Wheelchair
athletes go at 9.15 and elite women at 9.30. I am happier once inside the park.
We go to the baggage lorries and find the one for runners with numbers in the
30,000 to 35,000 range. We struggle into our trash bags to keep warm, just sticking
our heads out through holes in the top. I tell Daphne we have to go to pee.
There are lots of toilets and lots of runners peeing. You don�t want to stop
half way round. Ask Paula Radcliffe! After 15 minutes in the queue we are done.
I insist that we go right back to the end of the queue and wait our turn again
� and yes, there is more the next time! It�s now 9.40. Time to find our places
in the �pen�. I estimated we would finish in about 5 hours so we had been given
places in �Pen 5� at the back of the field.�
Once the Race begins, runners can move through the others depending on
how well they are running.� After all,
this is a Race! But, for the start, the challenge is just to get the massive
throng of people under way. Now we wait for the official start. It�s 9.55. Five
minutes to go, five minutes to the start of Daphne�s ordeal �.

&nbsp;

Daphne: So, we
eventually get to the start. Katya�s calm and I�m really nervous and talkative.
I�m usually a bit reserved but tension and the big event atmosphere have made
me talkative. But so is every one else and that�s really nice. But there are
yet more instructions from Katya. She�s being bossy and I�m really grateful.
She runs through the race plan again. Then there�s more to check off:-

&nbsp;

Five hour pen � check��� 

Find a pacer � check (there are guys and girls with Runners
World magazine who guarantee to run at a set speed. So if you want to finish in
5 hours you stick with the five hour group. Easy. Easy? Maybe! At least that�s
the idea.

Shoelaces � check

Timing chip secure - check

Final drink from small water bottle � check

Discard bottle (Yes, Katya, safely) � check

Intervals set on watch � check: 11 minutes to run and 1
minute to walk - check

&nbsp;

When we are through
this and I�m recovering I�m having Katya hooded and rested up in the cell for
this. Finally I�ll have some peace. Gee, wasn�t that a bit
harsh, Daphne? The girl�s only doing the job you paid her for.

&nbsp;

Suddenly, there�s a
bang and a cheer from somewhere way ahead of us. We all start to walk slowly
forward. This is really it! Really it is! We are actually doing this thing.
I�ve got a stab of fear and excitement both at once, but mainly excitement. I
want to laugh and giggle. Fat Daphne is actually going to run a Marathon!!

&nbsp;

Katya: Out of the park
and the course turns left and we pass through the first timing gate and that�s
it: we are now on the course. Our timing chips will have been recognised and we
are into the race at last. I have this odd feeling of trying to scramble up out
of a slippery cup. If I can only pull myself up over the rim I shall be free,
but I always just loose my grip and slip back ��. But, no time for daydreaming!
Marathons are run with your head as much as your legs. The course soon leads us
into Blackheath Village and the cheering crows begin. To our right, one family
have decorated their house with streams of British flags.� They are wearing flag hats and waving flags!
A little further on, a Priest scatters Holy Water on the runners and a few
metres beyond him a second Priest does the same. Further on again, small
children hold out their hands for us to touch them. It�s like some bizarre
religious ritual. We are anointed and we anoint others.

&nbsp;

Daphne: We have been
going a half hour through cheering crowds.�
Gee, this is really emotional. I never thought it would be like this. I
feel as though I�m airborne. I�m running really well and it�s the crowds. All
these people cheering and shouting, waving at us all � at me!. The course is
now running down hill. Got to be careful not to speed up. Stick to the plan.
Stick to the plan. No matter how good you feel don�t run faster than the plan.
The runners from the other start points are converging. In the distance I can
see the Canary Wharf Towers � they look a really long way away. Patience, girl,
patience. More instructions come from Katya: maybe I�ll have her gagged as well
as hooded?

&nbsp;

Katya: Do you see the
blue line, Daphne? Yes? Well run on it! That�s the optimum line, and it�s exactly
the marathon distance.� All the elite
runners run on or as close to the blue line as they can. Run there and you have
run in the footsteps of champions ��.

&nbsp;

Daphne: Run in the
footsteps of champions? That�s good! That was worth hearing! OK: cancel the
gag. But the hood stays.

&nbsp;

Katya: Start + 1 hour
on my watch. We have passed two water stations and taken on one sports drink at
the Lucozade station. We have reached the Cutty Sark sailing ship. 6 miles.
About one quarter of the race. Daphne has settled into her routine and we are
cruising well. On time. No issues at the moment. She�s sticking to the plan.
Good. That�s the main thing.

&nbsp;

Daphne: Before I
know it, we are at the Cutty Sark. The world�s fastest clipper ship. Well this
won�t be the world�s fastest marathon but just to finish will be great. This
part of London is real picturesque. That�s why I got my house near here. It�s
just how people Stateside think London is. There are even TV cameras here and
still more crowds. I�m still feeling goodl. I could get used to this!

&nbsp;

Katya: Now it�s quite a
long haul to get to the next psychologically important point which is crossing
the river at Tower Bridge. The danger is to really start to pick up speed here
to get on with the race and the key is to keep your mind on the job. But
Daphne�s sticking to the plan, following orders. To my relief we have reached
the Norwegian Church which means we will cross the river before too long in
about 15 minutes.� On schedule we cross
Tower Bridge. More cheering crowds. We have to steer clear of someone dressed
up as a rhinoceros as they are being interviewed� for TV. I have never been tempted to run
dressed up as anything but me.

&nbsp;

Daphne: The route to
Tower Bridge is rather dull and my mind keeps wandering. I look at Katya and
the easy relaxed way she moves is a joy to watch. It�s not the joy of
possession you understand, just the kick you get to see something being done
really well. Eventually we get close to tower Bridge and someone shouts my
name. I glance over my shoulder and there�s Phil. He is one of the accountants
I work with. I give him a big smile and he waves back and now I feel warm
inside and somehow going on is easier. As we cross the bridge, TV people are
interviewing a runner in costume ahead of us. Rather them than me!

&nbsp;

Katya: We�re making
steady progress. It is getting mentally tougher now. The euphoria of the beginning
of the race has slipped away behind us, and we are actually running
geographically away from the Finish Line. Along Highway, from The Tower to
Limehouse. Through the fourteenth mile of the course. We�re more than half way
now but the route heading east lies next to the twenty first mile of the course
heading west, so we get a very good view of the faster runners coming towards
us. Faster and rather tired by now!� Its
good to see them running so smoothly but its sort of discouraging to know it
will be more than an hour before we are running back this way again. I try to
take some of my own advice; - take a firm grip and keep myself under careful
control. 

&nbsp;

Now we�re following the
west side of the Isle of Dogs peninsula; sixteen miles safely over. In about
twenty minutes we will be at eighteen mile point and this is dangerous country:
the human body runs on muscle glycogen and has enough for� - eighteen miles. After that it has to use
fat and that�s not as easy. All of our training has been directed to getting
Daphne�s body (and mine too) able to burn glycogen more efficiently and to use
fat when the time comes, but here is where technique will tell: running,
drinking, breathing. But Daphne is not paying attention!

&nbsp;

Daphne: As we run
towards the financial district my mind starts to wander . I�m starting to feel
tired and introspective. This morning it�s been like being a hero, but I know
I�m no hero. Beside me Katya glides along and I�m now feeling guilty about what
I�ve done to her and not only her. What if all these people who cheer me on and
call my name knew what I was really like and knew some of the thing I�ve done.
I can feel tears starting to form in my eyes when there�s a stinging slap on my
left ass and as I look round I get another on my right ass cheek.

&nbsp;

��Daphne, what are you doing?�

&nbsp;

�I�m running what do
you think?� And quick as a flash Katya darts to my other side and slaps my ass
again. 

&nbsp;

�You�re not doing
what I told you, are you? Look at your fists. You have clenched them and you
are loosing your economy! Do I have to spank you again?�

&nbsp;

Actually the idea of
being spanked by Katya seems quite a good one but maybe here�s a bit
public.� Sorry Katya. Thanks for that.
Kind of.

&nbsp;

Part 3:
Houston, we have a problem� �������.

&nbsp;

Katya: We are now at
the tip of the Isle of Dogs and I can see the domes of the Greenwich
Observatory where we began, just a mile or two across the river, but seventeen
miles behind us along the course.� I
glance round at Daphne. She seems to have got through that low spot. She is
waving at two men outside public house. At first I think they must be work
colleagues but one of them catches my eye and suddenly there is a tight knot in
my stomach. Where have I seen him before? Why does he make me feel uneasy? More
than uneasy. Why does he make me feel afraid? As we run by he tries to break
eye contact, talking to his companion. He smiles and waves back at Daphne � and
then his eye comes back to me. We�ve passed them now and we�re turning north to
the Canary Wharf Towers. I take one last long look before they are out of
sight: he is speaking into his mobile phone����� 

&nbsp;

Daphne: We�re not
far from the 17 mile water station, there�s the entrance to the foot tunnel
that leads under the Thames to Greenwich. Five minutes walk and I�d be back at
the start! I catch sight of Larry and Harry. And there is Beth too. They all
smile and wave, especially Harry. Funny to think of them off-duty. Well, maybe
they�re not off duty. I guess they�ll have wanted to see how things worked out
with Katya after what they said about the problems they expected in training.
They are both enjoying the hospitality of the local Public House. It�s the Lord
Nelson. We always get a real good cheer when we pass a pub, but I�m beginning
to think that a drink would be nice and I�m not thinking about water! Katya is
on my right and keeps looking back down the road. She seems edgy all of a
sudden and all of a sudden I realise that maybe she has seen the boys too.� Seen and recognised? Oh, gee ��� what if
Eva�s around or Connie too? Katya made me memorise the course to pace myself
better and I know we are now going up East Ferry Road towards Limeharbour and
Canary Wharf. Katya is very quiet. And I�m very anxious. �You OK Katya?� She
doesn�t say anything. Maybe she�s just focussing on her running but it seems
like something more than that. 

&nbsp;

Katya: As we run on I
try to remember why I know the two men. When did I first know them? Are they
friends of Nicky? Did I see them at Daphne�s? I am sure I met one of them
before I worked for Daphne and the man with the phone has something to do with
Branca. Suddenly I realise I have been weaving from side to side. I almost
crack my ankle against the curb of the pavement. Concentrate, I tell myself, I
must concentrate. Get back on the blue line and stop thinking about Harry.
Harry? That�s his name, the taller man. But where do I know him from?
Concentrate on the running. Forget about them. Got to keep running. Got to do
my best for Connie. Connie? Who the hell is Connie? I�m running for me. Why I
am worried about Connie? Concentrate on the running. Seventeen and a half
miles, now. Think about Daphne. Got to look after Daphne. Harry says� Connie
says� What is this? Concentrate. I�ve got to concentrate. I�m losing my rhythm.
Go to concentrate. Forget about Harry and Connie. Forget about the training.
Training? What training? I ran the training. No, not Daphne�s training; my
training. It was Harry and Connie and it wasn�t about running. It was �. ? 

&nbsp;

Daphne: �Katya, are
you OK?� I say, �You�ve lost your rhythm. You�re not doing like you told me to.
Keep on the line.� She looks at me as if she doesn�t know me. I don�t know
what�s happening. I�m trying to keep running steadily. 

&nbsp;

Katya: Eighteen and a
half miles. We start the zigzag passing the Canary Wharf Towers. I am glancing
at the spectators� when I see them. Two
women. Searching the field of runners with their eyes, one short, athletic
looking she could be a runner, the other tall, black, elegant. They�re looking
for someone. The tall black girl is talking into her mobile phone. There is a
movement from Daphne: she was about to wave and as soon as I turn to her, she
drops her arm. I gaze at the women and feel a shower of adrenalin make its way
through my body.� For the past several weeks,
I�ve had the same nightmare, over and over again. About being taken away. Helpless.
Struggling. The men and women Daphne waved to are the people in my dream! I
meet Daphne�s eyes and I can see she knows who they are too. It wasn�t a
nightmare, it was real. That�s where those four weeks went! And now they are
here for me again. I kick hard and accelerate away as quickly as I can. I am
sure they will try to make their way through the buildings and trap me further
down the course. I take up a position in the centre of the field and run as
hard as I can.� Forget Daphne�s race
plan, now I have to have a plan of my own. All care about now is to put as much
distance as possible between these people and Daphne and me as I possibly can.
I�m safe here on the route. Policemen everywhere. Officials everywhere. It will
be safe at the finish too. Get to the finish. Seven miles to go. Think about
the timing. Think of a new plan. . Can I risk trying for 7 minute miles at this
stage? If I can hold that pace the race could be over for me in about fifty
minutes. I am running at that speed now and weaving through the pack of slower
runners ahead. At least this will make me harder to see, harder to catch, but
can I keep it going? 

&nbsp;

Just before twenty
miles, the course swings westwards and at last I am now running directly
towards the end. I let my pace slacken, but only a little. There are more
spectators again and I am beginning to recover my calm.� 

&nbsp;

Daphne: She�s going.
She saw Eva and Connie and just took off. I�ve almost lost sight of her in the
crowd of runners. She�s running much faster. I can�t hope to catch her and I
start to feel sick and tired and cold. Connie�s talking into her mobile phone
as I pass them. She�s gesticulating. Eva is trying to look down the route to
see where Katya has got to. They both understand what has happened and I
thought for a stupid moment that there was something they could do but of
course they can�t do anything about this. I am absolutely on my own now and I
am suddenly very lonely, just like before, before Katya. All I can do is keep
running. 

&nbsp;

Part 4:
Un-natural Acts

&nbsp;

Katya: As I run I can
almost feel the sticky threads of control breaking. I�ve been coasting round
the course to keep Daphne company but now I�m running fast and free for the
first time; perhaps truly free for the first time in months!� In my mind I keep seeing images of struggle
and victory, things I remember from school: Zhukov driving the Germans from St
Petersburg in the Great Patriotic War! Gagarin soaring into orbit in Vostok!
Before I knew it I was speeding (or so it seemed) along Highway towards the
Tower of London and well into the last 6 miles of the race. I had a new energy.
It was quite simply the best run I could remember!

&nbsp;

Daphne: I�m still
running but even in the crowd I feel alone. All along the course, I�ve enjoyed
the cheers of the crowd, but now I�m stalked by feelings of guilt. Sure, Katya
made me work hard to get here but without her I would still be that lonely, fat
,unpleasant, sad girl and in my desire to be different I�ve been prepared to do
anything � to hurt anyone� - I had to.
And now, I�m discovered.� It�s made the
pleasure of today turn sour!� My body is
really starting to hurt and the very person who I need, I really need, has fled
from me. I�m crying: tears of exhaustion, tears of regret �������

&nbsp;

Katya: I�m running.
Running again. My mind is back on my running. I�m on the blue line. Checking my
time. Running. My mind� begins to fill
with other images. I remember training runs in Moscow, by the Moskva, around
the gardens and towers of the Lomonosov University and through the woods and
open spaces of Sokolniki in the quiet of early morning after the cold white
winter had melted into the green of spring. But I have to concentrate. Run,
Katya. Think of the running. Run.

&nbsp;

Daphne: And there�s
this hand on my shoulder. For a moment I think Katya is there again but of
course it isn�t, it�s another runner. �First time?� she asks. 

&nbsp;

�Yes,� I sob.

&nbsp;

��OK now just keep going: it�s not far to the
finish. Do you know how far you have gone?� 

&nbsp;

��No,� I reply.

&nbsp;

�Well, you are in
the last 10K. How long do you take over a 10K?�

&nbsp;

�Me?� It�s hard to
run and think and talk at the same time.

&nbsp;

�Yes.� This other
runner seems determined to help me.

&nbsp;

�Eh, well I dunno,
maybe an hour. Yes, well on a good day.�

&nbsp;

�OK so you might
only have an hour to go! Just keep calm.�
You�re in front of the 5 hour pacer group, so just hang in there girl.
Have you tried to run five minutes and walk one minute?� 

&nbsp;

�Yeah: that�s what
I�ve been trying to do but I�ve lost my friend.� I start crying again, it�s
hard to see through the sweat and the tears.�

&nbsp;

� OK. Look, I�m
Jill.

&nbsp;

�OK Jill, I�m
Daphne. You�ve done this before.?

&nbsp;

�Ah Huh. Twice and I
must be crazy because this is my third time round.�

&nbsp;

�Look, it�s very
kind of you to stick with me, but don�t you want to get ahead?

&nbsp;

�Well let�s just see
how you get on. Look someone helped me on my first marathon. It�s what people
do. We all want everyone to finish.� I
can�t leave a sister to drop out at this stage! Come on five minutes run, one
minute walk.� 

&nbsp;

And so I�m gently
and unexpectedly pushed along by a kind stranger ����.

&nbsp;

Katya: Keep running.
Keep the rhythm. I am back in control of my self. I am calm again, running
smoothly. Keeping my rhythm, following the blue line, checking my watch and
thinking about my pace. I am calm again, running smoothly. Tired of course but
at least I can think straight again. First: What happened at Daphne�s? I can
remember having a row with Branca. Branca had said something and I was going to
leave. And Branca trapped me in the house �. Whoa, don�t lose track of the
running, you�re speeding up, Katya, keep the rhythm. And then the man came with
one of the women I had passed back there. Who were they? Associates of Daphne�s
of some sort?� What is it with Daphne and
Branca? Lovers? No: Branca was some sort of servant, almost a slave. Her slave?
People trafficked? No: she had been at University. Kidnapped? Enslaved somehow?
Does that happen? Daphne might have wanted that sort of relationship, the way
she was. Not just paying for companionship but taking a companion who could not
get away. So Branca must have wanted to make sure I stayed training Daphne and
Daphne obviously was not about to let me go and so the slavers came ��.. And
they must still be out there, looking for me ����. They can�t pull me off the
course - there are too many other people. I need to think about what happens at
the end of this. Could they try to get me at the end? In the finisher�s
enclosure, I�ll be safe. There�s policemen all around they won�t try anything
there. Maybe I can get from there to the Russian Embassy. That would be the
safest place, I guess. But would they take me seriously? I imagine some
aparatchick telling me to go away till Monday morning.� How am I going to get there? Daphne�s
people will be waiting for me and they haven�t run 26 miles.�

&nbsp;

Daphne: So I am now
still going along, a bit unsteady � a lot unsteady. The further I go, the more
I hurt and the worse I feel. And kind, patient, thoughtful, encouraging, Jill
beside me makes me feel a whole lot worse. Where is Katya? What is she gong to
do? Will she tell the Police? What will Clegg do to protect his people? Kill
Katya? Kill me? Kill us all? Does Katya know anyone in the Russian Secret
Police? Will they kill us?

�

Katya: At last, I�m
getting close to the finish. I am just passing London Bridge. Twenty three
miles gone; three to go. I�m thinking about Daphne. Should I be so angry? I am
glad I am here and if I hadn�t been training her I would not have had the
opportunity to run.� Worse: I would still
have all those debts; all the problems from Nicky. What should I do now?
Revenge is a temptation. Stalin said � there is nothing more satisfactory than
a well planned revenge�, and revenge is a temptation. Should I report her to
the Police? Enjoy her downfall? Is that right? Would Branca want that? Do I
want that? I have loved seeing Daphne change. Seeing the physical changes.
Seeing her becoming stronger in herself. Is it good to tear that down? 

&nbsp;

Then all of a sudden
it�s over. I hardly realised it, my mind was everywhere but where it should
have been. I�ve crossed the line. I�ve finished. I stop, looking left and
right, I didn�t even see what time I did. Someone hung a finisher�s medal
around me and I didn�t even notice that. My legs feel as if they are still
running. My shoulders ache. All of me aches. I see one of the officials coming
towards me with a foil blanket. For a moment I think it is one of Daphne�s
friends and I shy away but he smiles and holds the blanket out towards me.� I shrug apologetically, smile and take it
from him, clutching it around myself. I walk on slowly. Other runners are
finishing, we are all pushing and jostling in the throng as we make our way
into the Finisher�s Area. I sink down on the ground beside a tree are using. My
back is against the tree. I feel safe here. I watch as the other runners are
finishing, hugging the foil blanket around me, and I think about what must
happen next. There�s Branca. I have to make things right for Branca. And
there�s Daphne � she can�t want things to go on as they were. She changed as
she did this but has she changed enough to want something different? And why do
I want her to want something different? 

&nbsp;

Daphne: Oh I am
moving so, so slowly. The whole of my body hurts now. My shoulders hurt, my
legs hurt, my chest hurts.� When I
started, I thought I was well prepared. Well I was but all the preparation is
only that � preparation. You still have to do it and it hurts! Maybe I was
complacent. Well, I�m not complacent now. Jill has gone now. She ran on when
she saw I was OK. Where was that? Oh, yes, near the Tower. But there have been
others. On the Embankment, by Westminster and Big Ben.� I�ve been amazed by the generosity of other
runners and that really hurts too because I have been the exact opposite of
generous. I got used to rejection. If you buy things there�s no rejection. Just
the money and the goods. Or the people. ���..Big Ben? That means it�s less than
a mile to go. I�m close to the end now. In every sense. But I can do another
mile. It�s less than that first walk I did with Katya. Oh, what�s going to
happen about Katya? The Park is on my right and we are heading up towards
Buckingham Palace. I�m just about all in and as the course carries us round in
front of the big fountain � there is the finish! I am taken completely by
surprise. Two hundred yards and that�s it! And I start to run. I start to
run.� I have no idea where the energy is
coming from but I am running under the arch. I�m through! I�m here! All at once
I burst into tears. Done. Completed.�
Daphne has run a marathon! Twenty six miles, three hundred and
eightyfive yards! I walk unsteadily forward and one of the stewards steps in
front of me and puts a Finisher�s Medal around my neck. Immediately after, a
photographer is there, taking my picture. Next I�m ushered to where another
helper removes the timing chip from my shoe and then yet another helper hands
me a large carrier bag with my prizes inside. I am really getting stiff now. By
now I am by the line of baggage lorries. I look for the one with kit bags
30,000 � 35,000 and get my own bag back. I thank the helper and turn round to
see � Katya. 

&nbsp;

She holds out her
hand and says �Oh Daphne! I am so proud of you. Well done! You ought to have
known: when I take on a client, I do not like to let them go until I, I have
finished with them.� Katya
takes my hand and pulls me towards her and hugs me. And of course I completely
dissolve into tears again and sob and say how sorry I am and how I wished I had
not been so selfish and how I wished I was not the person I was and so and so
and so. And Katya keeps on hugging me�
������.

&nbsp;

Katya: I knew she could
do it. I just wasn�t sure if she knew she could do it. I just knew that she
could if she wanted it enough. And now I knew what I wanted too. I said to her,
�Daphne, we are going home together.� She looked back astonished. �But there
are going to be changes. Changes in our relationship and changes in your
household.� Daphne said nothing but nodded. �Get changed and then we will make
a start. That�s if your friends aren�t here to pick you up. Or to pick me up?�

&nbsp;

Daphne: Katya�s
accusation brings me to tears. Of course she�s right. Eva and Connie must be
here somewhere. And Harry and Larry. We�re safe right here, in the Finisher�s
Area, with event security and police around. But there are so many runners
spilling around in the Repatriation Area, all looking identical in T shirts
which say on the back �. �26.2 miles: That�s the Difference Between Us� Maybe
they are planning to snatch her back. Maybe they are planning to snatch both of
us. I know Clegg wouldn�t risk one of his operations coming unstuck. Even if it
involved compromising one of his customers. I look around us, terrified that
I�m going to see one of them in the crowd. But then I think Katya hasn�t run away
from me. And I can�t run away from her.�

&nbsp;

Katya: It�s as if
Daphne�s friends are standing there with a spotlight on them. The man from the
pub and one of the girls from Canary Wharf. I immediately look round. I feel
sure the others must be behind me, but that�s not possible because we are just
leaving the secure Finisher�s Area. No there he is. And the tall coloured girl.

&nbsp;

Daphne: I am holding
Katya�s hand as we walk out off the course at last. There is a real sense of
regret that the race is all over. But now there�s the next challenge and we
haven�t trained for this one. I walk up to the barrier where Harry and Larry,
Eva and Connie are standing. I throw my arms around Larry�s neck and kiss him.
He wasn�t expecting that. �Are you OK?� he says. �We thought there was a
problem?� Connie is watching Katya very closely. She smiles a tight lipped
smile at her. I know that she knows that Katya�s control has gone. �No,� I say,
�no problem. We�ve got some things to talk about but no problem.� 

&nbsp;

Katya: I�m standing
beside Daphne as she greets her friends. I�m determined that these people
should not make things hard for her. To be straightforward is best, I feel. �I
think you people need to know that there has been a revolution at the Winter
Palace,� I say. �We will not be needing you. Not anymore. Thank you for leaving
us alone. Please leave us alone.�

&nbsp;

Daphne: Katya is
REALLY positive. I really like it when she is like that! For someone who has
just run 26 miles, Katya is a revelation. No wonder she got me through! And
there is absolutely no trace of her prepping left. Connie will have to do some
more thinking!. Katya marches us past the guys with hardly a second glance.
Harry makes to takes a step forward but I don�t want him interfering. �Thanks
for coming to see us, guys, but you had better just listen to Katya. She�s
right. Bye. See you soon.�� I am holding
Kat�s hand tight. I say to her. �Thanks. Thanks for everything.� I turn back to
Larry. �Let�s meet next week some time and lunch, OK?� Just now, Katya and me, we need some quality
time together.� He looks at me closely but I think he sees how determined I am.
He shrugs and takes Harry�s arm, leading him away from the barrier.

The
Greenwich Tales

By Freddie Clegg
&amp; Phil Lane

The Mistress of Greenwich�s Tale

Part 1:
Resolution 

&nbsp;

I left the Mall with an
enormous sense of relief. For me, Katya, it was extraordinary. Maybe more
extraordinary than any other marathon I have run. We just walked away, Daphne
holding on to me, her head on my shoulder as we edged through the crowd of
runners, both of us oblivious to anything except the relief of finishing and
the turn our relationship had taken.

&nbsp;

We reached Daphne�s
home and both went for a shower.� There
is nothing like warm water washing away the residue of several hours� intense
physical effort. To feel the grittiness of dried salty washed from your skin,
leaving it clean and smooth, almost makes the effort of running worthwhile. I
finished my shower and wrapped myself in a towel and went looking for Daphne.

&nbsp;

She was sitting on a
stool in her bathroom, drying herself off, rubbing the towel over her spiky
short hair. I knelt down in front of her. As I looked up I caught her look of
confusion and concern and realised the cause. �Don�t worry Daphne, I want to
look at your feet, not kiss them.�

&nbsp;

The look of relief was
instant. �Oh, good, yes, why?� Daphne stuttered.

&nbsp;

�Blisters. Toenail
bruising. If we don�t check and there are any problems you can end up with very
sore feet.� I took each foot in turn, checking it thoroughly. �They�re fine,
Daphne,� I said. She looked pleased. �And now we have to talk.� 

&nbsp;

I sat down beside her.
Daphne nodded. �I know,� she said.

&nbsp;

�Daphne,� I began, I
guessed she knew what I was about to say. �I cannot be your slave. I think we
have seen that. I will not be involved in forced enslavement with you. I saw
too much of what that means at home in Russia. People who were in the Gulag, in
the camps. I can�t be part of anything that feels like that. I don�t want to
live looking over my shoulder for the immigration people, either. Actually,
neither do you, you are a guest in this country, too.�

&nbsp;

Daphne responded
quickly, almost too quickly, the words tumbling out. �Yes, Katya, I understand.
You�re right. Of course you�re right but�.�. Daphne had looked glum. �But
Katya, what about us. You�ve changed me, I�ve spent the last months doing
everything you say. It almost seemed like I was your slave.�

&nbsp;

�And how did that feel,
Daphne?�

&nbsp;

She blushed,
embarrassed. �Good,� she said. �I know it�s silly but it felt good. Just to
feel I could let myself do anything you said; whatever you wanted.�

&nbsp;

�But that didn�t need
chains or ropes or gags or any of Connie�s prepping, did it? You did it because
you wanted to, didn�t you?�

&nbsp;

Daphne nodded.� 

&nbsp;

I interrupted her.
�However, I know what I want for us. There are things I have thought about in
my own life. I know I want my life to include Branca and Daphne from here on
out. I love the idea of you as my slave, Daphne.� Her face lit up with child-like
delight. �But it must be because it is what you want. Long term, consensual
enslavement. Not brainwashed, not a robot, not on automatic pilot, like Branca,
but because you give your active consent and keep on giving it. That�s the only
way that it can work for me. And I think that will be good for you too, Daphne.
I only want what�s right for you.�

&nbsp;

I can see that Daphne
is watching me closely. Listening to every word. I see her mouthing the words
to herself; �long-term-consensual-enslavement.�

&nbsp;

�You�re not going to
leave me.� It wasn�t a question but a statement.

&nbsp;

�No, Daphne,� I said. �Even
if you don�t want to go through with this, I won�t leave you. I�ll always be
your friend. I respect what you did. To train as you did. To run as you did. To
get to where you are from where you were. That was an achievement. But if you
want more, then I can give you more. But it has to be as I say.�

&nbsp;

�Long term, consensual
enslavement?�

&nbsp;

I nodded.

&nbsp;

�I give myself to you
and go on giving myself to you?�

&nbsp;

I nodded again. 

&nbsp;

�That�s not an easy
thing to do.�

&nbsp;

�No, but neither was
running a marathon. And of course you didn�t,� Daphne looked puzzled for a
moment, �any more than any of us do. You ran one mile, and then you ran another
mile and then another mile. You just kept on running miles. That�s what this
will be too.�

&nbsp;

She kept on looking at
me. Taking in what I had set. Turning it over in her mind. I went on. �Here�s
what we do. You run your business and I run the gym and my training business.
You call me Katya and I call you Daphne. But here, everywhere, all the time, I
am your Mistress and you are my slave. Understand?�

&nbsp;

�Yes Katya. I
understand.� Daphne looked back at me with a steady gaze.

&nbsp;

�But do you want it?�

&nbsp;

�Yes Katya, I do want
it.� Daphne nodded her head emphatically. She was grinning widely. I felt her
trying to stop giggling. �Oh, Katya, I feel like I have champagne bubbling up
inside me.� I look at her. I know what she�s feeling. It�s a mixture of happiness,
fulfilment, fear and a reckless desire to drive with the brakes off.
Completely. �You know I should be calling for a cooling off period, like
they do when you buy pensions or insurance. But I can�t. I am falling over
myself to say Yes, Yes, Yes, before you change your mind.�

&nbsp;

�Absolutely sure?�

&nbsp;

�I�m absolutely sure,
Katya, even if I don�t really know what I am getting myself into.�

&nbsp;

I smiled. After all her
experiences that sounded strange. �Daphne,� I said, �you of all people must
know what you are getting yourself into. Are you still sure? Do you still want
to go ahead?�

&nbsp;

�Yes,� she said firmly.
�I mean I�m not sure. It�s different, isn�t it, like this? But I still want to
go ahead. I know that. Every bit as much as I knew that I had to run the
marathon.�

&nbsp;

I was touched by her
trust in me, touched by her courage. I leant forward and kissed her on the
forehead. She reached out and clutched my legs. I could see she was almost
overcome with emotion, weak and tired after the race. She started to shake, I
stroked her head anxious to calm her but there was one more thing that had to
be settled. �Now Daphne,� I said quietly,�what are we going to do about
Branca?�

&nbsp;

�Can�t� Branca just stay?� 

&nbsp;

�Sure. If she wants
to.�

&nbsp;

�If she wants to?�

&nbsp;

�That�s the deal,
Daphne, no slaves unless they consent, remember? You don�t need to buy
companionship these days. You can stand on your own feet now.� You don�t need props like bought, programmed,
captive slaves, do you?�

&nbsp;

�No, Katya, I guess
not.� No, I know I don�t. Gee, I
absolutely don�t. But I�ll miss her, if she goes. I mean it wasn�t just the
housework. She�s good to have around and there was the work she was doing.� 

&nbsp;

�What work?� I�d seen
Branca busy with some papers for Daphne but I�d never asked her what they were
about. It hadn�t seemed like it was my business. 

&nbsp;

�Well, I have this
investment in Brazil and I needed someone to translate some technical
engineering papers, so Larry�s people found Branca and brought her to me.�

&nbsp;

�Via Connie?�

&nbsp;

�Huh? Oh, sure, via
Connie.�

&nbsp;

�And before?�

&nbsp;

�Well, Branca was
studying engineering at Imperial College. That�s �. �

&nbsp;

�Yes, I know about
Imperial College. Well, Daphne: there is something more to resolve here.� If she�s bright enough to be studying at
Imperial she should not spend her life cleaning house and entertaining you.�

&nbsp;

�Huh?�

&nbsp;

�You are going to get
Branca re-instated at college after the summer.� 

&nbsp;

�But I don�t want her
to go. Any more than I want you to go.�

&nbsp;

�Well she might want to
stay but the least you can do is to give her back her life and then offer her a
job and somewhere to live. Agreed? Well, actually, those are my instructions,
slave. So that�s what is going to happen. Because I say so. Get used to it!�

&nbsp;

Daphne smiled up at me
with relief, I guess feeling that another weight had fallen from her. Suddenly
I realised that during our conversation she had slid down from her seat. Now
she was on the floor, kneeling. She looked at me with that same determined
expression I had seen at the start of the marathon. �Yes, Mistress,� she said.
�Absolutely.� Then, �Mistress?�

&nbsp;

�Yes, slave?� I said.

&nbsp;

�What happens now?�

&nbsp;

That was a pretty big
question. And I�d only thought about the answer to the first part of it. I
stoked the back of Daphne�s neck. �Some coaches say you should take one day�s
rest for every mile you have run. I guess that means you�ve earned a month off
athletics training. Then, when you have fully recovered, we will start you
running again with a view to some half marathons later in the year and I think
your physique could use some further work in the weights gym. Would you like
that Daphne?� She nodded. I knew she would. Running marathons is a drug. Even
while you�re aching from the last one you�re longing for the next. �

In the short term,
Branca and I are going on holiday.� We
deserve it. Somewhere warm, I think. We both deserve it and you can afford to
pay for it. A little present from you perhaps as an apology, maybe?�

&nbsp;

�Oh.� Daphne looked
sheepish and then apologetic. �Yes that�s only fair, I guess.� She paused for a
moment and looked concerned. �But what about me?�

&nbsp;

�Well, I said you were
having a month off athletics training. But there is some other training I want
you to do, some very special training of your own. While we are away.�

&nbsp;

�Special training,
Mistress?� She was getting into the swing of things quite well, I thought.

&nbsp;

�Yes Daphne, you see,
Branca and I have learned a lot from Connie. I don�t want you conditioned like
we were but I do want you to learn the discipline and obedience skills she can
give you. It just would not be fair for you to miss out! Would it?� Daphne
looked a little doubtful. �It�s not easy being a slave. You�ll have a lot to
learn and Connie is an excellent teacher Can I rely on you to fix that with
Larry?�

&nbsp;

And Daphne just said (a
bit weakly but she still managed to say it), �OK Mistress. I�ll go do it now.�

&nbsp;

I listened while she
spoke to Larry. I could only hear her side of it but I could tell he was
confused. 

&nbsp;

�Larry, I need another
favour.� �.. �No, everything is fine, Larry, everything is better than fine.
But I need a favour. I have a slave that needs to be trained. Not prepped, you
understand, not conditioned, just trained. Basics of obedience and discipline,
the usual stuff.� �� � Well, I thought it would be OK. I guessed you�d be happy
to take on paid training commissions.� ���Who�s it for? No, not for Katya.�
Daphne laughed. �It�s for me, Larry.��
�.. �Larry, are you still there. Oh. Right. Look, I know it�s strange.
That�s why I said it was a favour. I promised Katya I would go through what she
did, what Branca did. No not the prep stuff, just the obedience and discipline
training.� �.. �You can? Great. You�re an angel. Get back to me on when you can
take me. Mmm, soon as. Thanks.�

&nbsp;

Part 2: Asset
Management 

&nbsp;

Daphne left for her
Training a couple of days later. I will admit to teasing her a bit over the
training but I thought she�d like it anyway. Just before Larry�s people were
due to arrive I had her report in front of Branca and me in the living room.
She looked a little distressed when she saw Branca curled up at my feet but she
choked back any concerns and stood waiting for me to speak.

&nbsp;

�Are you ready Daphne?�

&nbsp;

She nodded. �Yes,
Mistress, if this is what you want me to do.�

&nbsp;

�It is, Daphne. Now let
Branca cuff and gag you ready for collection.�

&nbsp;

Daphne face gave an
expression of alarm. �Shouldn�t you do that Mistress?� she said.

&nbsp;

�It is my wish that
Branca should do it,� I replied. And that should be good enough for you.�

&nbsp;

Daphne looked bashful.
�Of course,� she said. �Of course.� She held out her arms in front of her,
wrists together. Branca got to her feet holding the handcuffs and shook her
head, indicating with her finger that Daphne should turn around. Soon the cuffs
were locked in place, the ball gag pushed into her mouth and strapped tight. A
ring at the door announced the arrival of Larry�s people and one of their
transport crates. Daphne was calm as Branca helped the two men fasten her
securely inside it. Moments later they, and she, were gone.�� 

&nbsp;

It felt strange.
Suddenly Daphne wasn�t there and I was wondering if she was all right. I knew
she would be, intellectually, of course. Larry�s people were careful, I knew
that but even so I worried. Branca tried to reassure me. That helped but even
so I was already looking forward to the time when we could all be together
again.� 

&nbsp;

It was a couple of days
later; the morning before Branca and I were to leave for our break. I phoned
the contact number that Daphne had left for me. 

&nbsp;

�Ms Mbazu�s office,� a
coolly efficient voice says, �can I ask who is calling?�

&nbsp;

�Katya Izotova,� I
reply. The line goes silent for a second.

&nbsp;

�Yes, Ms Izotova. One
moment, please.�

&nbsp;

And then Connie is on
the line. Her voice is deep, soft, gentle and reassuring. Just as I remember.
�Katya! How�s things? I have been really missing you! We had such fun. Why
don�t you and Branca just come round � before you go? To see me again? It would
be great to see you again. You know how much I�d like to see you again. How
much you�d like to see me again. Just come as you are. Just come �.now.�

&nbsp;

My head feels lighter,
as though I�m being lifted up, as though��
My hand goes up to my ear lobe and I pinch it very hard. Ouch that hurt!
That�s better. My head clears.� �Connie,�
I say, �lovely to speak to you. Nice try if I may say. You do not like to let
your girls go, do you?�

&nbsp;

The soft voice laughs
quietly, �No, nor the boys either.�

&nbsp;

I keep squeezing my
ear. The pain keeps me focused, keeps me in my right mind. �Anyway, Connnie;
Branca and I have been thinking about Daphne.�

&nbsp;

�She�s very well. She�s
made a good start. Of course it�s not easy for her. It�s a big change but she
is learning. She does seem keen to learn.�

&nbsp;

�That�s good but there
is something I would like � I would like her to come home one or two
souvenirs.�

&nbsp;

�To remember her time
here? I don�t think she�ll forget!� I could here the laugh in Connie�s voice.
�What did you have in mind?�

&nbsp;

�The first is she has a
tendency to get a little dry skin on her scalp. It�s very difficult to
moisturise her scalp properly. I expect you�ll be keeping her hooded for some
of the time,� Connie gave an affirmatory hmmm, �and that will only make it
worse. So the first thing is to give her a shaven head for the duration.�

&nbsp;

�That�s fine Katya. A
good idea. It really suits her. I was thinking about
keeping her completely shaven anyway. What else?�

&nbsp;

�Well in training
Daphne rather enjoyed the extra ear piercings she got as rewards for hard work.
There was no time to give her something special after her Marathon efforts and
so..�� 

&nbsp;

Branca leant across me
and called into the phone, �so we thought she could have her tongue and nipples
done.�

&nbsp;

�Ah, Branca!� Connie
said. �Nice to hear from you too. Isn�t that something you could do with as
well? But of course we can let Daphne have that and we�ll be happy to do it for
you too, Branca. For old times sake!�

&nbsp;

�One last thing,� I
said.

&nbsp;

�Last thing, Katya?
That�s a shame. I thought you were both coming round to see me. I thought that
was supposed to be the last thing.� Connie�s soft voice was a persuasive as
ever.

&nbsp;

�Thank you Connie, but,
no. Just look after Daphne. Maybe we�ll see you some time but not too soon.
You�ll forgive us if we think that it not be safe for us for a while.�

&nbsp;

Connie gave a resigned
sigh.

�One last thing. I told
you there has been a revolution. Well, this Mistress likes her slaves to be
marked. Please have Daphne tattooed. Make sure she knows all this is because
I�ve asked for it. I want a large Tsarist Eagle outlined in black on her right
shoulder. Make sure its placed to be seen whenever she wears an evening dress.
It should be quite large, about as big as her shoulder blade. I want another
just above her left ankle. The same Tsarist Eagle again but this time black as
though stencilled on a red background � so she can show it off during the day!
I will send the art work across. Can you do that?�

&nbsp;

�Of course, Katya. You
know, I�m thinking you really have changed since you were here.� 

&nbsp;

�I have not changed as
much as you might think Connie but I have just found a second vocation!� I knew
that whatever else happened I would always want Daphne in my life � just as
long as that was where she wanted to be.

Epilogue

&nbsp;

It�s Steve back again. 

&nbsp;

So, it all turned out
rather differently than how Daphne thought when she started. And now she�s got
this seriously strange thing going on at home. And if I think it�s strange,
then you can be sure it is.

&nbsp;

I called Daphne the
night after the marathon to see how she had got on. I knew she was running and
all and I knew she�d had some troubles with her trainer. Her house slave
answered the phone but when I asked to speak to Daphne she said. �Hold on, I�ll
see if she can come to the phone.� I had a vision of her stretched out
exhausted, I guess, but, instead she sounded really up.

&nbsp;

�Steve,� she beamed.
�Hi! Thanks for calling. It was great. I finished. It was wonderful and Katya
was wonderful and � oh - everything�s terrific.���� 

&nbsp;

I got to hear of how
terrific a bit later when I met Katya. She�s quite a forceful, young lady. 

&nbsp;

Mind you, I�m not sure
that they have all got the whole picture. Take Katya and Branca�s prepping for
example. I mean it not like you can just uninstall it, you can�t take that
conditioning away. It�s laying there in each of them. Sure Katya seemed to
break free of it but there will be something remaining. And Branca? Well, of
course the conditioning doesn�t function if it isn�t used, so as long as she�s
not reminded of her control phrase she�s as free as any of us. I guess Daphne
is a consensual slave in more ways than one. If she ever gave the word
Freddie�s team would have those two back in the centre for a top-up from Connie
faster than you could say �Do Your Best�. 

&nbsp;

Freddie of course,
doesn�t like unexpected outcomes. I was speaking to him when I was in London
recently. He wanted to re-prep Katya and Branca and tell Daphne that it was to
do with quality assurance of his services, but I said, �Look Freddie: If Daphne
asks, that�s one thing but you are in business and in business you have to
accept the unexpected. You have been paid over the odds and you have a
satisfied client. In fact your client�s client is satisfied. What more do you
want!� Freddie had looked sceptical but I guess he�s agreed with me so far. Anyway,
I think Freddie would be well advised to leave Katya alone. It wouldn�t
surprise me if she turned out to be �well connected� and the very last thing
Freddie needs to be chased all over the country by a bunch of Speznatz on
Katya�s account! He�s had enough trouble with Russians lately. And as Larry
pointed out, customers are usually right. But I�m also thinking that this new
project Larry is working on for Freddie means that he�s probably interested in
how the whole long term consensual slave thing shapes up. 

&nbsp;

I�m not worried about any
of that though. I�m just glad things turned out right for Daphne. 

&nbsp;

Anyway, instead of
spending his money in prep costs, Freddie threw a dinner party in London last
week, and I met up with Katya and Daphne. Daphne looked stunning; glowing
almost. She had on this strapless evening dress and the most astonishing eagle
tattooed on her back right across her right shoulder blade. Katya obviously
loved the way it looked, I caught her stroking the eagle�s neck a couple of
times. And Daphne dotes on her. She hardly took her eyes off her all evening. 

&nbsp;

So Daphne, the bashful,
shy girl had gone. She�d set out to look for someone to help her through a
marathon. While what she�s found with Katya mightn�t be what she planned for,
that�s what she�s got. I guess you have to be careful with the wording when you
wish. Or maybe not. It looks like things have turned out all right for all of
them.

It�s available as a DVD from: www.amazon.com.
It�s a great book
too.

&nbsp;

Location

&nbsp;

We thought Larry�s lunch date with Daphne
might have taken place at somewhere very like The Southwark Rose Hotel - www.southwarkrosehotel.co.uk.
(But not the same place, of course.) No waitresses were accosted in the
production of this story.� 

&nbsp;

The Green Stuff Restaurant was a complete
invention of Freddie�s but we are sure you could find something like it without
too much trouble! And the location is a lot like the Dorchester or the
Grosvenor House Hotel.

&nbsp;

There really is a pub near Island Gardens
DLR Station, where Katya catches sight of Harry. Phil knows this for a fact
because he has run past it in three London Marathons. He didn�t remember the
name but it is The Lord Nelson (any sufficient amount of Googling is
indistinguishable from real knowledge.) 

&nbsp;

Our tale reaches its climax on the course
of the London Marathon and we have described the route used in the London
Marathon 2007.

&nbsp;

Educational.

&nbsp;

Have you been inspired by Daphne�s example
to run a marathon?

&nbsp;

Well, you should be. It is quite simply
wonderful and everyone should take part at least once! (So says Phil as he�s
the one who knows when it comes to this stuff! What Freddie says is hey, if you
can write a Booker prize winner without going to Canada why can�t he write
about marathon running?) But running marathons takes time and planning � as
well as quite a bit of hard work. Here are some books and sites which will help
you on your way:

&nbsp;


 Marathon Running for Mortals:John Bingham� &amp; Jenny Hadfield (Quite simply
     excellent: beginners start here!)
 Marathon from Start to Finish: Sam Murphy
 The Complete Guide to Strength Training: Anita Bean
 Weight Training for Dummies:Liz Neporent, Suzanne Schlosberg
     and Shirley Archer
 Food for Fitness: Anita Bean
 Runners World Magazine 
 26.2 Marathon Stories:Katherine Switzer and Roger Robinson


&nbsp;

and a few helpful websites: - 

&nbsp;

www.burnthefat.com
: this requires a small subscription but it�s excellent: very down to earth, no
gimmicks and full of good advice. If you need to loose weight, definitely go
here.

&nbsp;

www.jeffgalloway.com
: a great exponent of the run/walk method in marathon running. He also provides
on-line coaching)

&nbsp;

www.waddleon.com
: the site of John �The Penguin� Bingham. Phil used one of his programmes� - �The Penguin Get You Round Plan� - to train
for his first marathon!

&nbsp;

www.runnersworld.co.uk
: the sister site for the magazine, although you have to subscribe to the
magazine to have the full benefit. 

&nbsp;

www.london-marathon.co.uk
: tells you what you need to know about the London Marathon and much more,
including a map of the route at : - 

http://www.london-marathon.co.uk/site/images/course_map.pdf

&nbsp;

The BBC have a virtual
tour of the London Marathon route. (We�re not sure how long this will be up
after the Marathon finishes this year) Click the �Red Start� to see the route
as Katya and Daphne did:-

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Practical

&nbsp;

You will find plenty of advice on
practicalities in the books and at the websites we have mentioned. However, if
you have set your heart of running, do not be afraid to join a running club and
a gym to help with your training. There will be plenty of other people just
like you starting out and the camaraderie and fellowship you will have is
invaluable.

&nbsp;

Thinking about clothes to wear, get some
proper running kit, just like Daphne did. It�s so much more comfortable that
just wearing an old cotton T shirt and any old pair of shorts. Going to a
specialist running shop is best: the people who will look after you will know
what they are talking about. You should be able to find one near you from the
adverts inside Runners World, and THIS IS ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL when it comes to
buying running shoes. 

Meanwhile, here are some interesting
websites:

&nbsp;

www.viga.co.uk
: athletic clothing

&nbsp;

www.ronhill.co.uk
: athletic clothing

&nbsp;

www.profeet.co.uk
: a Rolls Royce of a place to buy running shoes, in Phil�s opinion

&nbsp;

If you are into gadgets, you will not go
far wrong by investing in a heart rate monitor and perhaps a GPS to tell you
how far you have gone.

&nbsp;

Check out;

&nbsp;

www.polar.fi
: the market leader for heart rate monitors and their UK distributor (www.heartratemonitor.co.uk) with
a really good FAQ on the whole subject.

&nbsp;

www.garmin.com
: makers of a GPS which records distance run � when it can see the satellites �
which is most of the time unless you live in the jungle, or perhaps right in
the centre of the city. Follow the links to Garmin Forerunner 205
and Garmin Forerunner
305. A recent test of the Garmin 305 showed it performed accurately even
when used under cover in a pine forest!

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Whimsical

&nbsp;

We spent a while thinking about which
chastity belt and slave collar Daphne might have bought for Branca. (I spend a
lot of time thinking about things like that, says Freddie.) Neither Freddie or
Phil has any personal experience as a basis for advice, but these are the ones
that appealed to us:

&nbsp;

www.tollyboy.com
: chastity belts. Daphne chose the FGA/200 with drop down waistband for Branca.

&nbsp;

www.axsmar.com : slave collars etc. We thought Daphne would have bought Branca the Talena collar in
titanium! Does Katya buy one for Daphne? You decide!

&nbsp;

One Other Thought

&nbsp;

Reading about slaves and slavers in erotic
fiction is one thing but the reality is very different. 2007 is
the bicentenary of Britain's abolition of the Transatlantic Slave Trade but
some of the practices by today�s real slave traders are every bit as horrific
as anything that was done then. If you
wish to support the work of the Anti-Slavery Society, visit them at www.antislavery.org
