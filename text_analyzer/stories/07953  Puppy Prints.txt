Synopsis:  He knew how her day had gone, he always knew.  Even when she tried to seem alright, he saw through her, pried it out of her until she confessed to what was bothering her.  Today was worse than most, but happened to be one they would have alone once they got home.






He knew how her day had gone, he always knew.&nbsp; Even when she tried to seem alright, he saw through her, pried it out of her until she confessed to what was bothering her.&nbsp; Today was worse than most, but happened to be one they would have alone once they got home. 

Just as she was pulling into the drive, a text came through detailing what he wanted her to do before he got home.&nbsp; That wasn't unusual but what it specified was not the usual week night instruction.&nbsp; She had been hesitant to even read it, knowing she had snapped at him earlier and expecting it would be bad.&nbsp; Maybe she could say she hadn't heard it, left the phone on vibrate and didn't feel it.&nbsp; As tempting as that was, she drew a slow breath, reminded herself how well he knew her, how much she trusted him to see to her needs even when she wasn't sure what they were. 

Opening the phone, she read.&nbsp; Not a list of chores he wanted done or what he wanted for dinner, but, instead, a short and to the point note.&nbsp; "Strip at the door, turn on the radio, blindfold, ear plugs.&nbsp; Stand in the corner until I get home."&nbsp; Even as her brow furrowed and she stared at the phone, she couldn't help the tingles that came. 

Still in the truck, her head leaned back against the seat with a low groan.&nbsp; Two hours, at the least.&nbsp; Far longer than he had ever made her stand before.&nbsp; There was a brief moment that she considered waiting, shortening her time by not going in the house.&nbsp; A very brief moment. 

Stopping only long enough to smoke one last cigarette, she stepped into the house and undressed, folding her clothes to lay on the washer.&nbsp; Passing through the living room, she turned on the music and went to the bedroom to get the blindfold and ear plugs.&nbsp; Putting the plugs in, she turned the music up loud enough that she could still hear it before stepping into the corner.&nbsp; the blindfold pulled on, she settled in for the wait. 

What she didn't know was that he had already arranged to get off early for the day.&nbsp; She had only been standing there a half hour when he came into the house.&nbsp; The music muffled what the plugs didn't block and he stood behind her smiling as he watched her shifting from one foot to the other. 

Not yet letting her know he was there, he went back to the bedroom, turned down the bed and gathered all he wanted for the evening.&nbsp; Laying out the bonds and toys to the couch, he stepped up behind her, one arm encircling her waist as his hand closed over her mouth to stifle the cry that was sure to come.&nbsp; Pulling her back against him as she jumped, he leaned in to her ear, speaking just loud enough for her to hear.&nbsp; "No talking.&nbsp; You've done enough of that for today." 

She let out a quiet whimper, trembling against him as he held her close.&nbsp; He let the music again fill the room, saying nothing for a long moment as he read her responses, her fear of what was coming seemed to have replaced her anger for what had happened during the day. 

His hand moving from her mouth, his fingers curled into her hair, guiding her back from the corner and down to all fours.&nbsp; Crouching in front of her, he brushed the hair back from her face and leaned in to kiss her brow, "My puppy." 

Creeping closer to him, she nuzzled whatever part of him that she could reach, releasing her emotions into his care.&nbsp; He knew that he had already settled her by just that gesture, but he wanted more.&nbsp; 

Leading her into the bathroom and over into the tub, she held on all fours, her head bowed as she waited.&nbsp; The first warm spray against her brought a quick breath, tears stinging her eyes behind the mask.&nbsp; He knew she was crying, he could see the quivers in her shoulders.&nbsp; He knew they were tears of release, relief that she was totally his.&nbsp; As the scent of his marking filled her breaths, he smiled, watching the tension visibly fade from her body until the only trembles were from her efforts to remain on all fours. 

When he was done, he sat against the side of the tub, cupping her chin his hand with a brush of thumb at her cheek.&nbsp; Removing the plugs from her ears.&nbsp; He sat them to the side and leaned down to whisper, "Mine."&nbsp; That single word was her last undoing and her hips dropped until she sat against her heels, her head at his thigh as the tears dried. 

Reaching over her, he turned on the water, letting it heat as he removed the blindfold and laid it to the side.&nbsp; The showerhead in one hand, he bathed her, never letting her away from his touch.&nbsp; If his hand wasn't on her, he had her cheek pressed to his thigh, keeping that contact. 

Once she was clean, he helped her from the tub, drying her off and then leading her out into the living room.&nbsp; But for the occasional whispers of reassurance, he said nothing as he placed cuffs to her ankles and wrists, her collar to her throat.&nbsp; Replacing the earplugs and the blindfold, he led her to her cage. A blanket laid over her, he fastened the cuffs together.&nbsp; One last brush of hand to her face and she heard the door close.&nbsp; Locking the crate, he laid a second blanket over it and left her there as he did his own unwinding from the day.
 She had no idea how much time had passed, having dozed in and out for the majority of it.&nbsp; He knew from the subtle shifting inside of the cage when she was sleeping, when she had awakened and waited until one of the times she was adjusting to return to the cage for her.&nbsp; Lifting away the blanket that had further darkened her world, he released the lock and latch, one hand moving in as he opened the door. 

A soft whimper came from her lips as his hand brushed against the bare curve of shoulder, her head lifting and turning towards him despite the fact that she couldn't see him.&nbsp; There, she held and waited, listening to the quiet sounds of music that made it past the earplugs.&nbsp; Her muscles soft beneath his hand, he continued petting of her, watching her face until her head lay back down against the pad inside.&nbsp; Releasing the cuffs from each other, he gave a gentle tug of hair to let her know to crawl out. 

Moving back from the door, he watched as she eased up to all fours, stretching before she crept out towards him and stilled just outside of the cage.&nbsp; He had brought her this deep before, many times, but for tonight, he wanted to push her deeper.&nbsp; A bowl of water set before her, he guided her head down until her mouth touched to the liquid, watching as she drank and raised back.&nbsp; An almost evil grin at his lips, he pressed her face back down to the bowl, holding her there until she finished as much as he wanted for her to drink. 

Letting that settle, he brought her around on all fours in front of his chair then sat back, still watching her as his feet lifted to rest against her back.&nbsp; Her face turning towards him in question, she felt the tip of the crop touch against her jaw, then the back of her head, guiding it into the position he wanted of her.&nbsp; The leather then skimmed along the soft curve of hip, barely touching of her as she began to squirm.&nbsp; A sharp strike stilled her and he resumed the light petting until she was again moving.&nbsp; Another landed, silently telling her that he didn't want her moving at all. 

Once she understood what he wanted of her, he continued the slow stroking of leather over her.&nbsp; Knowing that she hated the way her stomach looked when she was on all fours, he made a point of petting her even there, reminding her that he loved every part of her, that every part was his, a strike landing against her belly when she tried to tense it up and hide it from him.&nbsp; When she had relaxed but for the effort of remaining still, he brought her head back around, water again put to her lips for her to drink.&nbsp; Whimpering, she pulled back from the water only to have him urge her to drink more.&nbsp; That grin of his still in place, he sat back again when she finished.&nbsp; 

But for his feet on her, he didn't touch her, not giving her any further distractions from the need he knew would be all consuming soon enough.&nbsp; The first squirm of discomfort was met with the sting of the crop, the next the same as were those to come until even the strike was not enough to still her or quiet her needful whimpering.&nbsp; A glance given the clock, he counted off the minutes more that he would make her wait, knowing each seemed like an eternity to her. 

When he was ready, he attached the leash to her collar and stepped around to her side with a light tug that had her scrambling in a blind dash for the bathroom only to be drawn up short in the hallway.&nbsp; She almost wet herself there on the carpet when she realized he wasn't going to let her go to the bathroom, thinking he was going to make her just crawl around and hold it.&nbsp; The kitchen floor beneath her knees didn't give her a clue yet as to what was coming, her mind set on getting to the bathroom before she made a mess.&nbsp; It was when the door opened and she was led outside that it dawned on her what he was going to make her do. 

She paused just outside of the door, sitting back against her heels against the tug of the leash, holding on to that last shred of control that she had for as long as possible.&nbsp; He debated letting her sit there, knowing how badly she had to go but opted to enforce his will on her physically instead.&nbsp; A sharp smack of hand to her hip had her up and moving again, her hands and knees soon in the cool grass as he led her to where he wanted her.&nbsp; He paused, knowing that she understood what he wanted, but leaning down to speak to her plugged ear.&nbsp; "Pee for your Master, puppy." 

That command changed even this need for her, turning it from something she was doing because she had to into doing it because he wanted it of her.&nbsp; Her knees spreading against the grass, her head hung as she tried to relax enough to go.&nbsp; Giving her a moment to settle herself, he waited until the water he had forced into her was coming out before he began to pet of her, again murmuring reassurances to her that she was his and he loved her. 

When she was done, he cleaned of her with the towel he had picked up on the way out, drying her thighs and pussy before leading her back out of the grass and wiping her knees clean. 

He knew that, in that moment even more than most, he could ask nearly anything of her and she would comply without question.&nbsp; Thinking on that, he smiled as he led her back into the house. 

Walking with her into the living room, he paused at his chair and gave a tap to her hip.&nbsp; Waiting until she sat back against her heels, he touched her forehead with a pair of fingers, her signal to stay.&nbsp; Her face turning up to him, he leaned down and brushed a kiss to her lips before dropping her leash and stepping away.&nbsp; Going into the extra room, he rolled out the padded bench he'd made.&nbsp; Placing that in the center of the living room, he lifted the leash from the floor and guided her up and into place. 

Giving her a moment to settle herself, he fastened her wrists and ankles to the hooks set into the wood.&nbsp; A thick belt curled around her waist, he buckled it to further immobilize her to the post of the bench.&nbsp; Her head last, he laid a fresh cloth over each padded side of the cradle that would keep her face away from the possible sting of tails and closed the leather strap around the back of her head. 

His hands began to drift over her, feeling of her skin, the quivers of muscle as she waited.&nbsp; Even without the blindfold, she wouldn't be able to see much, but with it, she had only the music around them and his touch.&nbsp; One hand lifting from her to take the whip from the couch, the other continued to pet of her as the tails of leather were dragged against her back.&nbsp; The first touches light, teasing, he waited until she began her quiet whimpers, the squirming against the bindings. 

His hand moving from her, he began what would be a thorough whipping.&nbsp; The pace slow at first, he settled into an easy rhythm, letting her lose herself in the sensations.&nbsp; Slowly building both the intensity of the strikes as well as the speed of them, he watched as her skin began to warm, her soft cries and moans mingling with the music that she no longer heard.&nbsp; Without breaking his steady raining of blows, he took the heavier whip in hand, switching without pause to let the more solid strikes begin. 

She was lost in the feelings he was giving her, totally his both body and mind.&nbsp; Thought was gone from her, nothing mattering but him. 

Welts soon raising with each strike, he moved around her, covering her back and ass with the red streaks.&nbsp; Watching her body responding to the leather, he waited, whipping until he knew she was nearing the edge.&nbsp; His hand slipping down between her thighs, it took no more than a touch to send her over, her body almost convulsing against the bench as he continued the whipping, each landing of tails causing that orgasm to grip her tighter.&nbsp; The strikes eventually lightening, slowing, he brought her down until she collapsed against the bench. 

His hands replacing leather, he stroked over her as he had at first, careful of the more welted areas as he checked her over.&nbsp; Though he knew she was awake, he also knew not to expect any responses from her.&nbsp; A soft blanket wrapped around her, he released the bindings and gathered her into his arms. 

Carrying her back to the bedroom, he laid with her on he bed, keeping her tucked close as he held the bottle of water to parched lips and let her drink her fill.&nbsp; Settling in for a rest, he stroked of her head and touched light kisses to her face, smiling as he whispered, "Mine."
