&nbsp;

Hi, I�m Cecilita, but
my person is of no interest in this story. We are many girls in different ages
in a group in the South of Sweden. We are joint by our feelings submissive,
that is why we choose the name SUBLIGAN (Sub-gang) for our group. We met
regularly on first Tuesday in the month and then one of us is telling about an
event or experience from the last time. Mostly the stories are true, but
sometime they are more a wish or a fantasy in a hope to come true.� 

I�m chosen to handle
the protocol, or more precisely to record and later write down the stories.

That also means that I
can�t take credit for the story only the blame for the poor translation. 

If you decide to read
it you have to live with that. The alternative is that the story would never be
told. 

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

One Tuesday we were
temporary out of stories and Alice announced that she had a story, but at the
same time she winked at me. It was a so quick wink that I wonder how quick our
brain is to perceive small signals. One of the problems in this rapid process
is that when we looked our mind in a decipherment it will block out other
alternative.

I was unsure if her
winking indicated that her coming story not rested on her real experience. I
have forgotten to ask her because when she started her story it didn�t felt
that important. 

&nbsp;

Alice is a girl in her early twenties. She is around
160 cm (5 ft 3 in) and has a dark hair, which is filled by millions of small
curls. So many that her hair looks frizzy, as it lived its on life. The length is just to her shoulders.

She looks like my doll
Mary, as I had when I was a little girl and that my mother bought at the shop Boreus in Helsingborg. Her face is baby-sweet with a little nose.
Her lips that are just perfect and she has cheeks that you want to bite, even
as a girl. 

&nbsp;

From her chin and down
every comparison with Mary stops.

&nbsp;

Alice has a generous bust and promising curves,
without of being chubby, but I can imagine her after 15 years being a little
Madame in her body if she doesn�t watch for it. But for that scenario she has
many years left and now she is just between being thin creeper and a buxom.

&nbsp;

(In Sweden we have a special word for when something is
between, LAGOM = �Just medium and I like it as it is�.)

&nbsp;

Her voice is high and
soprano and has a tendency to give away when she is excited.

&nbsp;

When she stand in
front of us she is dressed in a dark brown pleated skirt, that follows her
lines and fit close to her inner thighs when she moves, an autumn brown plain blouse
(shirt-waist) in the same hue as high heels (pumps). Her movements are
abstemious as she mostly stands still and rather stiff.

&nbsp;

//

&nbsp;

To give her story a fair
background I have later had an interview with Jimmy. He also admitted and
confirmed his part in the manipulation of her. You will quickly understand why I
start with Jimmy�s �confession�.

/Cecilita.

&nbsp;

JIMMY

&nbsp;

My crime: �I�m not at all proud of what I did, but I�m a
man and want to feed my eyes with pictures of beautiful girls to look at and
I�m also a person who wants to be (must be) in control of things. 

I plead guilty!

&nbsp;

The flat (apartment)
beside of mine in the block of flats (apartment house) has been empty for two
months and that was rather unusually because of demand.

&nbsp;

So it suddenly sprang
out in activity in the flat. Different craftsmen started to repaint and repaper
in there.

&nbsp;

Curiously I visit the
flat and watch electrician work with their cables and things.

&nbsp;

They told me that a
single, young and good-looking girl was to move in to the flat and they also
told me that she was a spiritualist or something similar. 

&nbsp;

In the middle of the
wall, facing my flat (apartment) was a big electric tin in the wall. I ask them
what it was and they told me that the same family had rented both mine and this
flat before my time. That was why the family has had a communication installed
between the flats, with microphones and loudspeakers on both sides. The cables
went through the common wall.

&nbsp;

Now the painters
(coming Monday) were ordered to repaper the wall and its hollow space. 

I had not noticed
anything on my side of the wall, but would surely investigate it.

&nbsp;

It was late Friday and
the workman wanted to go home. I was still in the flat and they were in a
hurry. There was nothing to steal in the empty flat so they ask of me to lock
the door when I went in to my flat.

&nbsp;

Suddenly I was alone
in the empty flat and stood in the room with the tin. 

&nbsp;

The electricians were
ready with their work and the painter should put paper over the tin on Monday.

&nbsp;

The technician in me
started to wonder. The factors were:

The tin in the wall, a
single girl was to move in to the flat and she was a spiritualist. The last
meant that she believed in ghosts and spirits. 

In any case was a
secret communication between the two flats useful, now or in the future a good
thing. In any way nothing negative.

&nbsp;

I didn�t lock the door
but went in to my own flat and opened my tool-box. I didn�t find what I
searched for so I went down to my radio store.

&nbsp;

I have I radio-shop
with five employees. They are two male sellers, one girl at the pay-desk and
two technicians beside of my self. The shop has a good location and is giving
me good money. The girl in the cash-audit has give in her notice. She is moving
to another town with her boy-friend. I will miss her and the female company at
the firm.

�

Back in the flat I put
together supervision equipment, with a new all-around-loudspeaker, web-camera
and a microphone. I paste a piece of wall-paper and putty over it all and a bit
of sticky tape to protect the lens and the microphone. The camera had an
electric motor to steer the zoom. 

&nbsp;

I don�t want to bore
you stiff be details, but when I tested it in my computer I got a surprising
good picture over the room. I could even read the text in a paper I put on the
opposite wall.

&nbsp;

To divert the painter�s
watchfulness I put some putty on other spots on the wall. It must look like
someone had prepared for their wall-paper-work.

&nbsp;

I the rest-time on
Saturday and Sunday I tested the sound by putting in a radio and when I tested
the loudspeaker I was surprised that I was difficult to determine from where
the sound was coming.

&nbsp;

Monday the painter
arrived and I talked to him and he suspected nothing. 

Now my only problem
was if the girl could put up a painting or a print over the camera lens.� But that was out of my hands.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**ALICE**ALICE**ALICE**ALICE**ALICE

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

ALICE:

&nbsp;

I broke up with my guy
and moved to my first own flat (apartment).

&nbsp;

It was wonderful to
have my own life, even if I missed him from time to time. 

&nbsp;

I was enjoying coming
home among my things, have a nice cop of tea and sit in front of the TV, when
ever I wanted to. If I felt for a nap I could take it without of having to
explain or make apologies. 

&nbsp;

Halle, my boy-friend had been rather dominating, not
that I objected, but I didn�t like him being constantly jealous at anyone who
had trousers (pants) in my present. As long as he was dominant when we played
our little games it was OK, but when he started to steer my life in jealousy he
went too far. His jealousy becomes unhealthy for both of us. A little jealousy
shows protection and love and ownership, but� �

If he just could be
dominant without of being jealous it would be fine.

&nbsp;

Now I was naked in my
flat, with the door locked and I enjoyed my newfound freedom. I love to be
naked, it gives me a feeling of closeness to nature beside it tickled my pussy
(cunt) in such an erotic way.

&nbsp;

I was naked in Halle�s flat as often as possible but I worried about
him getting tired of my naked body so I started to ration my nudeness.

&nbsp;

The last three years I
had more and more started to believe in a life after this one. With my 22 years
as a starting-point I�m thinking that moving ahead will not be in endlessness. 

&nbsp;

The thought of the
inescapable death frighten me to death (smile).

&nbsp;

When I contacted a
spiritualist grope I started to get a glimmer of a life after this. It helped
me to control my agony of death and it didn�t felt that scaring anymore.

&nbsp;

I visit several
s�ances and heard voices and shapes from the other world. 

Every other believed
and so did I. But I also search for technical and logical
explanations to what was happening.

&nbsp;

I register for a
course. A well-known medium had a lecture and training for a small group for
1200 SEK (170 dollars) for a week-end.

We sat in form of a
circle and on the floor was a big piece if cloth and there were seven candles.

&nbsp;

She led (lead) us
verbally through the ceremony and several of those taking part thought they
getting contact. I didn�t get that far, but felt it close, very close, but it vanished.

&nbsp;

The leader told us
that we all had given our voluntary signal to the spirit-world that we wanted
to have contact. Most important was that we should not be scared.

&nbsp;

Was I afraid?

No, I don�t think so.

&nbsp;

Spiritual world was
for me positive and something I must respect.

&nbsp;

I felt a great
respect, but no fear, I think. 

Everything was unknown
and a little frightening by that. It is always easier to understand things you
can touch.

&nbsp;

Several evenings here
locked in my secure flat I tried to conjure up a contact. I sat naked on a
stool in my big room and speak up loudly. The thing that I was naked was no
deal at all. It was simply so that I was almost naked all the time.� 

&nbsp;

I did exactly as I was
taught, both feet on the floor, hands in my thighs, breathe calmly and tried to
visualize different part on my body. 

&nbsp;

Suddenly I got a
feeling of that I wasn�t alone in the room, somebody was watching me.

&nbsp;

But that was
impossible. The entrance door was locked, twice and the security chain on. I
was strictly alone in the flat.

&nbsp;

But the feeling of
being watched was still there. I moved my knees together as a good girl. If
something was in the room it couldn�t be anything dangerous.

&nbsp;

�I wanted to have contact and I had wished it
for so long now. If there really was a spirit-world I knew that my mortal dread
would disappear. It would be as if the life shifted over to another form.

&nbsp;

I had absolutely no
hurry with my own death.

&nbsp;

With all this thoughts
in my mind I loose my concentration and abort my try to a s�ance.

&nbsp;

But I vas now
convinced that I wasn�t alone in the room, that somebody watch me. I felt it
like a good feeling, there were hopes.

&nbsp;

I took the telephone
and rang my contact person, the woman who had had the s�ance and our training.

At the ending of the course
she had told us to contact her if we had any questions.

�

I told her everything
in detail, what I�ve done and how I felt, that I had had the strong feeling of
being watched and also that I had had checked the entr�e door and it was
locked. There was only I in the room. The fact that I was naked was so
unimportant so I didn�t even mention it.

&nbsp;

�It is absolutely terrific!
It sounds just like you had your spiritual leader in your room!� 

She explained and was
happy on my behalf.�

&nbsp;

I didn�t find it that fabulous,
more of a little peculiar. But certainly, she was right!

Most of all I felt
thankful for her to not call my feeling in the room in question.

�

//

&nbsp;

When I had lived in my
flat a week or so, something odd happened.

&nbsp;

I sat naked at my
stool and suddenly I heard a dark and dull voice that called: 

�Alice! Alice! Do you hear me?�

&nbsp;

I went stiff and felt
it like my heart stopped and rushed to the entr�e door to control it. It was
locked. I was here alone in my own security and felt a little shame over my
impolite rush to the door.

&nbsp;

I returned and fell on
my plaited basket, that I had my crochet-work in and manage to hit my little
toe in a leg of my sofa, but it didn�t hurt until later.

&nbsp;

I sat down on the
stool and answer:

&nbsp;

�Yes, I hear you! Who
are you and how do you know my name?�

&nbsp;

�I�m your spirit
leader, so naturally I know your name.�

&nbsp;

I had tried to locate
the direction, but it was heard as if from the centre of the room.�� 

&nbsp;

�I have heard about
the spirit leader at the course. Are you my spirit leader, Sir?�

&nbsp;

I felt that a �SIR�
was very right in this moment.

&nbsp;

�Yes I�m and I can
lead you in the right direction, if you want me to. Do you want that?�

&nbsp;

�OH, Yes, please!�

&nbsp;

�Okay, that�s good. I
will be back. Continue to do as you do.�

&nbsp;

�Yes,
Sir!�

&nbsp;

Then the voice was
gone and I didn�t hear from it that evening or night.

&nbsp;

Every thought I have
in my head dance its own dance. I don�t know if it was in dizziness or just the
thoughts having difficulty to stand still.�
It was so unreal, as in a dream. It must be a dream!

&nbsp;

In the morning I
called the woman again and told her everything.

&nbsp;

I told her that the
entr�e door was absolutely locked and the safety chain was on and that I was
alone in the flat. 

&nbsp;

I asked her again what
she thought.

&nbsp;

�I�m completely
convinced that you have got contact with the spirit world and for that you
shall feel auspicious. It is not that many that are chosen. Just keep doing
what you do.�

&nbsp;

That was funny I
thought when I had thanked her and finished the call. I didn�t tell her that HE
had said just so: �Keep doing what you do!�

&nbsp;

Now I was also
convinced, anyway much more that yesterday. I had got contact with the spirit
World. There was no other sensible explanation. I was chosen and I had got a
spirit leader, who was going to guide me in my life.

&nbsp;

I could only follow
his advice in security and he could make everything right. JESUS!� This was better than the first prize on
LOTTO, better than everything. I was blest!�


&nbsp;

Next evening I sat
naked on the stool in the room after carefully locked the door. I had showered
and smelled good as a woman. Of course I wanted to be at my best, but didn�t
know really how to do.� 

&nbsp;

With my eyes closed I
tried to think on the point in my stomach (solar plexus) and tried to imagine
the blue color over my crown.

&nbsp;

It didn�t even felt ridiculous
when I in my naked loneliness asked out in the room:

&nbsp;

�Are you�re here,
Sir?�

&nbsp;

It was quiet. No
answer and I kept thinking of the imaginary hole opening up over my crown, as
I�ve learned at the course.

&nbsp;

�ALICE�

&nbsp;

�Yes,
Sir. It�s nice that you are
here!�

&nbsp;

It was the same voice
as before. I heard it in the room, but could not figure out from were. Perhaps
it was so that my brain was so locked to my fact that it came from a spirit
that it possible not could come from a distinct place in the room.

&nbsp;

�Yes,
ALICE!�

&nbsp;

�Can you help me with
an advice, dear spirit leader, Sir?�

&nbsp;

I didn�t know how to
address this spirit phenomenon, perhaps spirit notability, but I felt a great
respect. Like an elevated sensuous respect. And it felt so unreal. 

&nbsp;

�First
thing. Where you sleep
there is negative forces and pouring. I suggest that you move your bed to the
opposite wall. And you will sleep much better.�

&nbsp;

�Thank
you Sir for your advice.
Shall I move it now?�

&nbsp;

�Do so. Then go back
to your stool.�

&nbsp;

I rose and went over
to my bed. From where I got my strength I don�t know, but I took hold of the
end of the bedstead and pulled the whole bed over to the other wall. I would
remake the bed later, so I got my pillow close to the wall.

&nbsp;

Then I returned to my
stool.

&nbsp;

�It is true Sir, that
I have slept badly since I moved in here and I thought I was because of my
missing of Halle. I hope it will be better now. Thank you for
your advice, dear Sir.�

&nbsp;

�I will help you gladly,
that is why I�m here. I have also noticed that your physical fitness needs to
be adjusted. That is why I suggest that you do a little exercise in the
morning, before you take a shower and get dressed. Set your alarm clock half an
hour earlier.

It is good for your
heart.

&nbsp;

Funny! I had thought
of some exercise in the morning, to stretch out my body, but I had not really
found the start switch.

&nbsp;

Now I would do it.
Good for my heart. So good than!

&nbsp;

I must know how to
address a spirit leader.

&nbsp;

�Sir. How should I address you?�

�

�You shall address me
exactly as you feel in your heart that you should.�

&nbsp;

I thought that MASTER
was the word that I used when Halle and I played our games and it felt so natural.
Perhaps that was what my spirit leader meant, �As I felt in my heart!� Perhaps
the word Master was enough. Yes, it had to be Master!

&nbsp;

�Please Master. Can
you see if there is any post for me? I�m unemployed for a time now and I start
to run out of money since I left Halle. Everything cost. I would hate to crawl back
to him again. I don�t mind him being dominant but I hate his jealousy and it�s
growing, as you know. I know that it is short of employments, but in any case,
Sir.� 

&nbsp;

I noticed that I was chattering,
as I do when I�m highly-strung. I want to say everything at the same time and
my thoughts just streams out of my mouth.

&nbsp;

�I know that you left Halle and that is a good decision. There is another
man in your future and he is very close to you. You shall obey him in love.
Yes, there�s a work for you. On the road from here to Halle there�s a big radio-shop. You shall go in
there and ask them for work. There you will become employed at the cash-desk.
Then you will also get close to the man of your heart.

Remember that you will
get high pleasure out of it, if you shall obey him in love�

&nbsp;

He said. 

&nbsp;

So he knew that I
liked to obey a man. Now he saw a work for me. To be unemployed had been my big
problem since I left Halle and I didn�t want to crawl back to him on the reason
of money. It felt so whorish. Not that he would mind. He said: �You will soon
crawl back me and that would be crawling naked over my doorsill.� 

&nbsp;

I knew exactly what he
meant that I should crawl naked in to his flat to show my complete defeat. And
I know that all his revenge for leaving him should hit my pour bottom in strike
after strike. And after that he would be a cruel Master, having me at his beck
and call and thrown at his mercy.

&nbsp;

My God, how
humiliating! But also nice. I would have no where to
turn, just to obey. Funny, just now it didn�t tempt me. A man
in the future for me? 

Perhaps a new Master, that I would obey in complete trust and love.

&nbsp;

�Thank you very much,
Master!�

&nbsp;

�I will leave you now.
If you need me just do as you have done now.�

&nbsp;

I remembered. I should
sit on my stool, relax and call for him.

&nbsp;

Naked? Was that a must?

No it had not been a
demand from him. I liked to be naked in my flat. Pooh, it doesn�t matter. If
I�m in nude, as now, it is not wrong anyway. 

&nbsp;

�Do as you have done� 

&nbsp;

I�ve always got a hard
and troubled feeling in my chest when I didn�t know what was right or wrong. To
get clear and distinct orders of what to do was always so nice and secured. All
anxiety disappears and I can just obey. 

&nbsp;

I remember saying to Halle: �Just tell me what to do and I will switch
off my brain and do it. It is so easy life for me.�

&nbsp;

Now I was in many more
steps convinced of my experiences and that there was no other explanation. If
there was no other explanation, there was not reason to search for one.

&nbsp;

Beside of that you
must show great respect for those high phenomena. 

&nbsp;

So suddenly a new
thought stroke me. When I walked around in the flat He could see me. I must not
think that way. He had surely no sexual connection to human sexuality. It was
probably only a natural way of view.

&nbsp;

I liked to think of
nudity as a natural thing.� Natural!

The nature showed us what�s
natural and that is natural.

&nbsp;

//

&nbsp;

If there is pronounced
interesting for the rest of the story it will continue, other ways it ends now
as it is only a feeler. And I rest my case.
