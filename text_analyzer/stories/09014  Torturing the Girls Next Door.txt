Chapter One: Michelle
�No, no, no! Please, no, no! Please, please! Not with that! Please, Master, I beg you!�
One of the two middle-aged women bound in my dungeon pleaded with me as I approached her helpless body with my electric baton humming in my hand. Her nude, sweating body trembled with trepidation as I took slow, threatening steps towards her. She wrenched her handcuffed wrists and tugged at the chain fixed to the ceiling that stretched her arms tightly above her head. She tried to take small steps away from me, her ankles bound and separated by a spreader bar. She backed her feet away from me as far as she could, her body leaning forward and her gorgeous breasts hanging down and swaying from side to side. She whimpered as I moved the baton menacingly close to her breasts, her large, frightened eyes glancing alternately at the tip of the prod and my stern glare.
�Come forward. Stand properly!� I commanded her. She hesitated. I turned the voltage knob on the baton. She whimpered and retraced her steps until she stood straight once more.
�What&#8217;ll it be, Michelle? Yes now, or yes later?� I asked her.
�Please, Master. I can&#8217;t. Please!� she pleaded.
�Yes now, or yes later?� I repeated, tracing the outline of her quivering nipple an inch above the flesh of her breast.
�Please, Master. Please. I can&#8217;t!� she begged.
I thrust forward and touched the baton just above her navel. There was a surge of power as the electricity leapt from metal to flesh. Michelle&#8217;s body shook as she sprang backwards.
�Aaahhhhhhh!!!!� she screamed, �No!!! Please!! Please don&#8217;t!!! It hurts like hell!!!�
�It&#8217;ll hurt a lot more if you don&#8217;t stand properly, I promise. Now, answer the question, yes now or yes later?� I pressed on.
�No, Master, please!� she moaned in frustration, �I can&#8217;t. Please don&#8217;t shock me again.�
I placed my left arm around her back so that she could not move away, and pressed the tip of the baton against her right nipple. She baton surged and hummed. Michelle gasped, shuddered and then shrieked.
�Aaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhh!!!!! Oooooooooohhhhhh!!!! Aaaaaaaahhhhhhhhh!!!!! Sto-o-o-p!!!! Please!!! Mercy!!! Please stop!!! Aaaaaaaaahhhhh!!!!�
I backed off. Her breathing was short and rapid, her face was flushed, her cheeks soaked with tears of agony. I deactivated the baton with my thumb, pulled her profusely sweating body closer, and pressed the now cold metal tip to her other nipple. My thumb hovered ominously over the power switch. She shuddered.
�Now, Michelle. I want you to tell me. Are you going to say &#8216;yes&#8217;? Because I&#8217;m sure you know I won&#8217;t accept a &#8216;no&#8217;. You either say &#8216;yes&#8217; now, or I make you say &#8216;yes&#8217; later. Needless to say, the time between now and then will be�.how shall I put it�unnecessarily painful.�
Her pleading eyes stared into mine, her delicious moist lips parted to negotiate further. My thumb slid forward over the switch. The current hummed. The chain rattled. Her body shook. Her left nipple stood forth in agonizing protest. Her areola followed its lead, as the current ravaged her tender breast.
�Aaaaaaahhhhh!!!!! Oh God!!!!!! Stop!!!!!! Please!!!!!!!! YES!!!! YES!!!! I&#8217;ll do it!!!! Stop please!!!!!!�
I backed off and released her tortured body. She hung from the chain, panting desperately. A pool had formed between her legs, the current having overpowered her control of her pussy. I replaced the baton in its holder and kneaded her breasts with my hands. She moaned in an indescribable mixture of pain and pleasure. I squeezed and twisted her throbbing nipples. She screamed and threw her head back in ecstasy. I undid her from her bondage, freeing first her wrists and then her ankles. The chain fell to the floor. I extended my arms, and she fell into them. I felt her sweating breasts against my body, her hard nipples pushed against my ribs, her moist cheek rubbed against my collarbone. 
�Good girl, Michelle. You made the right choice. You&#8217;ll enjoy it, I promise. Don&#8217;t worry. Here, give me a kiss.� I comforted her.
She reached up and locked lips with me. It was a slow passionate kiss, the type that allows a master and his slave to reaffirm their relationship to one another. She drew in sharply as our lips parted.
�Go and sit down,� I whispered in her ear, �Relax for a while. Let me see what your friend has to say.�
Michelle sat down slowly on the couch, her hands gently massaging her tormented bosom. I turned on my heel to face the second woman at the other corner of my dungeon. She stiffened at my gaze.
�Marilyn! Having observed what just transpired, what is your answer?� I asked, pacing across the dungeon towards the second of my captives.
