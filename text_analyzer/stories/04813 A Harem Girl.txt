&nbsp;

&nbsp;

����� Jack
nervously sat looking over his cards and watching the expression on the huge
black man sitting across from him at the table.



&nbsp;

&nbsp;

�� �Come on, Jack.
Show me what you got!�



&nbsp;

&nbsp;

� Jack�s fingers
were shaking as he placed the cards on the table. Jack had a pair of queen�s.



&nbsp;

&nbsp;

� Leon
began to laugh hysterically as he slammed his hand along with his cards on the
table for Jack to see.



&nbsp;

&nbsp;

� �Let me see what
you gonna do now, my man?�



&nbsp;

&nbsp;

� �Leon.
You know I don�t have any money. Please, let�s play again. I�ll make it good
this time. I promise.�



&nbsp;

&nbsp;

� Leon
laughed as he looked over at the other two men in his entourage. 



&nbsp;

&nbsp;

� �You hear this
guy? I think I heard this sorry piece of crap here, want�s
me to give him another chance.�



&nbsp;

&nbsp;

���Please. Leon.
I promised I�ll make good on this loan.�



&nbsp;

&nbsp;

� Leon slammed his
fists down hard on the table making everything fall over as Jack sat back
nervously waiting to see what Leon was going to do next.



&nbsp;

&nbsp;

� �Listen. Bro. I want my money you owe me and I want it tonight!�



&nbsp;

&nbsp;

� �Leon.
You know I don�t have the money tonight. You�re going to have to give me a
little time.�



&nbsp;

&nbsp;

� Leon
reached over the side of the table and grabbed an empty chair and tossed it
across the room.



&nbsp;

&nbsp;

� �What the fuck do
I look like to you? Do you think I�m a loan officer at the loan department of
your local bank?�



&nbsp;

&nbsp;

� Jack nervously
shook his head as he tried to respond.



&nbsp;

&nbsp;

� �Leon.
You know me really well. I can come up with the money. You just need to give me
a little time and I�ll make good on it.�



&nbsp;

&nbsp;

� Leon
walked next to Jack and held out his hand.



&nbsp;

&nbsp;

� �Give me your
wallet.�



&nbsp;

&nbsp;

� Jack was shaking
as he reached into his back pocket and pulled out his wallet and gave it to Leon.



&nbsp;

&nbsp;

� �Leon.
I wasn�t lying to you. I don�t have that kind of cash with me.�



&nbsp;

&nbsp;

� �Shut up you
fool, don�t you think I already know that?�



&nbsp;

&nbsp;

� Leon
crossed the room and sat down on a sofa and began looking through Jack�s
wallet.�� He grabbed hold of a few dollar
bills and laughed as he tossed them onto the floor. Leon
began looking through the compartment where Jack had his driver�s license and
personal photo�s.



&nbsp;

&nbsp;

� Leon
was on a roll now as he took out the driver�s license and showed the other two
men in the room. Leon
fumbled through the little pages and turned the wallet on end and looked at a
photo that caught his eye.



&nbsp;

&nbsp;

� �Wow. What do we
have here?�



&nbsp;

&nbsp;

� Jack nervously
watched Leon as
he quickly replied.



&nbsp;

&nbsp;

� �That�s my wife,
Natalie.� 



&nbsp;

&nbsp;

� Leon
kept studying the photo which was a photo of Jack�s wife in her bikini.



&nbsp;

&nbsp;

� �Hey stupid. Tell me what�s a beautiful
redhead like this want with a stupid bastard like you?�



&nbsp;

&nbsp;

� Jack didn�t know
how to answer as he sat nervously waiting for Leon
to stop his humiliation. Leon
flipped another page where Jack had a nice closeup
shot of his wife.



&nbsp;

&nbsp;

� Natalie had long
red hair and Leon
was studying her smile and green eyes at the moment.



&nbsp;

&nbsp;

� �Tell me
something, Jack. I bet your wife Irish!� 



&nbsp;

&nbsp;

� �Yes. As a matter
of fact she is Irish.�



&nbsp;

&nbsp;

�� �Oh. Good. That
means� she has a red bush!�



&nbsp;

&nbsp;

� Jack was too
embarrassed to answer that question as he starred down at the floor.



&nbsp;

&nbsp;

� �I want you to
tell me in your own words, Jack. Tell me your wife�s bush is naturally red.�



&nbsp;

&nbsp;

� Jack swallowed
hard as he replied. �Yes. It�s red.�



&nbsp;

&nbsp;

� Everyone in the
room broke out in loud laughter as Jack sat feeling humiliated in his chair.



&nbsp;

&nbsp;

�� �I want to know
something else about Natalie.�



&nbsp;

&nbsp;

�� Jack watched and
waited as the huge man lean forward as he studied the photo.



&nbsp;

&nbsp;

� �Has Natalie ever
fucked a black man before, Jack?�



&nbsp;

&nbsp;

� Jack quickly
shook his head that she hadn�t as he kept starring down at the floor waiting to
hear what Leon
would ask next.



&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

� �Tell me
something, Jack. Is Natalie a good fuck? Is she tight as I suspect she is?�



&nbsp;

&nbsp;

� Jack�s body was
shaking as he boldly replied.



&nbsp;

&nbsp;

� �I don�t think I
need to answer those questions. Can I please have my wallet back now?�



&nbsp;

&nbsp;

� Leon
had an angry expression on his face as he replied. �I�ll give you the dam
wallet back when I�m ready. I asked you a question so don�t make me come over
there and ask you again.�



&nbsp;

&nbsp;

� �All right. Yes. She�s a good lover!�



&nbsp;

&nbsp;

� The men broke out
in loud laughter again as Leon
sat back in the cushion and fumbled through the wallet again.



&nbsp;

&nbsp;

� Jack was getting
very upset now because he knew what Leon
was going to find next.



&nbsp;

&nbsp;

� �Fuck! What do we
have here?�



&nbsp;

&nbsp;

� The other two men
leaned over so they could get a look at what Leon
had found. Jack knew that Leon
had found the photo that Natalie had posed for him showing her tits and nice
smile. Natalie was well endowed on top.



&nbsp;

&nbsp;

� �Jack. You�re
full of surprises tonight. I think I just found a way for you to pay me back.�



&nbsp;

&nbsp;

� Leon
picked up the dollar bills off the floor and tucked them inside the wallet and
before he folded it over he took out the photo of Natalie showing off her large
breasts in the photo and slipped it inside his shirt pocket.



&nbsp;

&nbsp;

� Leon
stood up and gave the wallet back to Jack and pulled up a chair next to Jack
and sat down.



Jack nervously waited for the huge black man to speak. 



&nbsp;

&nbsp;

� �Jack. You�re
going to fix me up with a date with your wife. I don�t care what you have to do
but I want you to meet me at this club on Friday night and I want you to have
Natalie dressed appropriately for me.�



&nbsp;

&nbsp;

� �Leon.
I don�t understand. You�re talking about my wife here. How can I allow you to
touch my wife?�



&nbsp;

&nbsp;

� �Listen
carefully, Jack. I already told you what I want as payment for the twenty-five
thousand dollars you owe me. I don�t care what you tell her or what you have to
do to get her at my club on Friday, but I expect you to be there at eight.�



&nbsp;

&nbsp;

� �Leon.
Can�t we talk this over? I promised you I�d pay you back. Let�s leave my wife
out of this.�



&nbsp;

&nbsp;

� Leon
grabbed a hold of Jack�s shirt and pulled him over the table and slammed him
down on the floor.



&nbsp;

&nbsp;

� �Don�t fuck with
me or I�ll kill you. I told you how I was taking back my money, now I want you
to have her at the club on Friday and I want to see her dressed in something
sexy. Do you understand me?�



&nbsp;

&nbsp;

� Jack shook his
head that he understood.



&nbsp;

&nbsp;

� The two other men
picked Jack up off the floor and stood him up in front of Leon.



&nbsp;

&nbsp;

� �I don�t want you
to say a word to your wife, nor do I want you to do anything stupid like going
to the police. Do you understand what I just said?�



&nbsp;

&nbsp;

� Jack nodded his
head that he understood as the two men carried him out the door as Leon
hollered out.� �Be there at eight!�



&nbsp;

&nbsp;

� They through Jack out in the parking lot of the rear of the
building. He slowly stood and brushed off his shirt and pants and
nervously walked toward his car. What was he going to tell Natalie?



&nbsp;

&nbsp;

� Natalie knew something
wasn�t right when he came home late that evening. His pants were torn and he
paced around the house until he finally got into bed.



&nbsp;

&nbsp;

� �Jack. What�s
wrong? What happened tonight?�



&nbsp;

&nbsp;

� Jack could answer
her questions directly but had thought up a lie as he replied.



&nbsp;

&nbsp;

� �I had a flat
tire tonight and ripped my pants. Um . . . I ran into an old friend tonight
that invited me out to this club on Friday. I told him all about you and he is
anxious to meet you.�� 



&nbsp;

&nbsp;

� �What friend?
Where did you know him? What�s his name?�



&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

� �His name is, Leon.
We were in the service together and he just moved into town and I told him
about us and he mentioned how he would like to meet you. I didn�t think you
would mind.�



&nbsp;

&nbsp;

� �You never
mentioned anyone with that name before. Why all of a sudden are you telling me
now?�



&nbsp;

&nbsp;

�� Jack nervously
thought up an answer.



&nbsp;

&nbsp;

� �We were friends
for a short while during boot camp and just never talked about him much.�



&nbsp;

&nbsp;

� �What�s this Leon?
Did you lend him money or something?�



&nbsp;

&nbsp;

� �No. It�s nothing
like that at all. Leon
owns this club, which he wants us to meet him at this Friday and asked me to
buy you a new dress.� 



&nbsp;

&nbsp;

� Natalie was
confused. �Who is paying for the new dress?�



&nbsp;

&nbsp;

� Jack had to think
fast.



&nbsp;

&nbsp;

� �Um. Leon
said he would pay for the dress himself. He just wanted you to look your best
when he meets you.�



&nbsp;

&nbsp;

� It was late and
Natalie didn�t ask anymore questions that night. The next morning before Jack
slipped out the front door for work, she managed to
catch him and asked.



&nbsp;

&nbsp;

� �What do you want
me to wear on Friday and how much money can I spend?�



&nbsp;

&nbsp;

� �Um. Wear something sexy, I don�t care what you spend as
long as it makes you look nice.�



&nbsp;

&nbsp;

� Jack rushed out
the door before Natalie had a chance to ask him anymore questions and as she
hollered out to him he turned and said. �I�ll call you on my lunch hour.�



&nbsp;

&nbsp;

� Jack had been
able to finagle his way around any more questions about Leon
that week. Natalie was showing and getting ready that evening while Jack paced
the floor again.� Leon
had called him at work yesterday and told him not to forget about their date on
Friday. 



&nbsp;

&nbsp;

� On Friday
morning, Natalie decided to take her neighbor, Alice along shopping with her
for a new dress. Alice was a petite
blonde married to a guy named Richard. Neither couple had any kids but spent
plenty of time traveling and going out together. Alice
was Natalie�s closest friend.



&nbsp;

&nbsp;

� �Natalie. Who is
this old friend of Jack�s that he wants you to dress up so sexily for?�



&nbsp;

&nbsp;

� �Alice.
You know how men are. Jack is proud of the way I take care of myself and Jack
most likely wants this guy to see that I�m every bit as pretty as he told him.�



&nbsp;

&nbsp;

� Alice
picked out a sexy green dress for Natalie which was low cut and showed off
Natalie�s cleavage. It was a cotton dress that fit tight but not extremely
short. It was short enough to show off Natalie�s fabulous long legs.



&nbsp;

&nbsp;

� Alice
decided to buy a black dress since Natalie talked her into going along on
Friday since Richard was out of town all weekend on a business trip.



&nbsp;

&nbsp;

� They arrived at
the club about five minutes before eight and walked inside the dark club and
past people dancing on the dance floor as they searched for Leon.
Finally. Jack saw Leon
sitting alone back in a booth in the corner.



&nbsp;

&nbsp;

� They approached
him and Leon
was well dressed in black with his shirt unbuttoned almost down to his navel.
He wore� large
diamond earrings in both ears. Natalie and Alice were surprised to find out
that he was a black man. Natalie looked at Alice
when they saw how muscularly well built he was.



&nbsp;

&nbsp;

� Jack introduced
the ladies to Leon who was very pleased as he took each of their hands and
kissed them. Alice scooted around
to the opposite side of Leon
from where Natalie sat. It was Leon�s
idea that they sit next to him in the booth.



&nbsp;

&nbsp;

� They ordered
drinks as Leon
got acquainted with the two wives.



&nbsp;

&nbsp;

� �Jack. I didn�t
know you were going to bring me a bonus tonight. You�re a good man and you keep
your word.�



&nbsp;

&nbsp;

� The women glanced
at each other as Natalie started the conversation. 



&nbsp;

&nbsp;

� �Jack told me you
two were in the service together.�



&nbsp;

&nbsp;

� �That�s right. We
were. Jack told me all about you but I didn�t believe you were this beautiful.�



&nbsp;

&nbsp;

� Both wives kept
starring at Leon�s
large arms and his wide shoulders. Neither woman was ever attracted to a black
man before but both found him very handsome and charming. Their conversation
went from talking about how Leon and Jack met to the women asking Leon
about how much he worked out to keep in such great shape.



&nbsp;

&nbsp;

� Leon
seemed to have both wives� attentions as he tried to divide his contestation in
half with each wife.



&nbsp;

&nbsp;

� �Why don�t I take
both of you ladies to my personal gym here at the club and I could teach you
both how to properly lift weights?�



&nbsp;

&nbsp;

� Leon
had them sucked in when Alice
mentioned that Richard was gone for the weekend. They agreed to meeting at the
gym the next day. Jack just sat listening to Leon
as he made his moves on his wife and Alice.



&nbsp;

&nbsp;

�� Jack was in deep
thought at the moment trying to figure out a way to shift all of Leon�s
attention over to Alice and leave
his wife out of it. OK. So he was being a jerk sitting up his neighbor�s wife
with Leon. What
other choice did he have?



&nbsp;

&nbsp;

� Natalie and Alice
excused themselves to go to the ladies room leaving Leon
alone with Jack.



&nbsp;

&nbsp;

� �Listen. I want
you to go stand near the bar and have a couple drinks while I talk to your wife
and Alice. Oh. Don�t come back until I give you a signal. Is that clear?�



&nbsp;

&nbsp;

� Jack began to
stand up and walked out of the booth as Leon
yelled. �Hey. Thank you for the double treat!�



&nbsp;

&nbsp;

� Alice and Natalie
had returned and had slipped into the booth on either side of Leon.
Leon was very
gifted when it came to women and he knew it. Neither of the two wives appeared
to be concerned about where Jack had disappeared to.



&nbsp;

&nbsp;

� Jack stood next
to the bar and ordered a drink and by the time the bartender got around to
handing him what he ordered and turned around, Leon
was out dancing on the floor with Natalie in his arms. They were dancing to a
slow song and Jack noticed Leon�s
hands were holding onto her waist with his fingers touching the top of her ass.



&nbsp;

&nbsp;

� Jack could see
Leon Whispering in Natalie�s ear as he held the attractive wife very close to
his huge body. Natalie was talking back to Leon
as he spoke to her and they seemed to be in discussion about something as
Natalie was moving her fingers as if she were explaining something to Leon.



&nbsp;

&nbsp;

� Leon
was moving Natalie toward the corner of the dance floor as they continued to
talk. Natalie�s body was leaning out as she held onto Leon�s
large arms so she could look in his eyes as he spoke. Leon
suddenly leaned forward and gave Natalie a little peck on her cheek. 



&nbsp;

&nbsp;

� Jack�s heart
began beating faster as he took a long swig of his drink and kept watching his
wife with Leon.
Natalie was looking into Leon�s
eyes now as he spoke to her and suddenly leaned forward again and kissed her on
the lips this time. It was a short kiss but it was on her lips!



&nbsp;

&nbsp;

� Natalie appeared
to be saying something to Lean as he leaned forward again and captured
Natalie�s lips again and held the kiss a few seconds longer. Jack was so busy
watching them kiss that he didn�t notice that Lean had moved his large hands
onto Natalie�s ass and was holding her tight.



&nbsp;

&nbsp;

� They were in a
very deep conversation now as Natalie seemed to be explaining something to Leon
again. Leon
tilted his head and gave Natalie another long kiss on her lips. Natalie
appeared to be kissing him back this time. Jack took another long sip of his
drink as the song ended and looked back and got startled when he saw Leon
standing in front of him.



&nbsp;

&nbsp;

� �Where in the
fuck did you disappear too? Get your ass back to the table and sit with your
wife while I dance with Alice. Oh.
Don�t get too cozy because I want you to excuse yourself again when I get
back.�



&nbsp;

&nbsp;

� Jack almost
spilled his drink.� He was shaking so
badly. He was acting like a total wimp with Leon.
What else could he possibly do? He owed this guy twenty-five thousand dollars
and he didn�t want to get hurt. He new Leon
had a reputation of doing great bodily harm to people that owed him money.



&nbsp;

&nbsp;

� Jack walked back
to the table behind Leon
and waited for Leon
to take Alice onto the dance floor
and scooted into the booth next to Natalie.



&nbsp;

&nbsp;

� �Honey. I saw you kissing Leon
out there on the dance floor. What was that all about?�



&nbsp;

&nbsp;

� �Jack. You told
me to be real nice to your friend. He was telling me about his best friend
getting killed over in Iraq
and I felt sorry for him.�



&nbsp;

&nbsp;

� �Natalie. Feeling
sorry for him is one thing but letting him kiss you and put his hands on your
ass!�



&nbsp;

&nbsp;

� �Jack. Listen to
me! I don�t think Leon
meant any harm by doing that. He was only looking for a little comfort from
someone. Stop reading into everything you see.�



&nbsp;

&nbsp;

� They glanced on
the dance floor and saw Alice
dancing with Leon.
It was a fast song and she seemed to be enjoying herself. 



&nbsp;

&nbsp;

� It seemed to Jack
that Leon was
trying to gain her trust. He wondered what Leon
had planned and decided to bring up Alice
to her.



&nbsp;

&nbsp;

� �Natalie. It
looks like Leon and Alice are getting along just fine. Why don�t we go home and
let Leon take
her home?�



&nbsp;

&nbsp;

� �Jack. Have you
gone completely out of your mind? I don�t know what�s wrong with you but will
you stop trying to act like a jealous husband and just enjoy the evening?�



&nbsp;

&nbsp;

� Leon
was walking back toward the booth with his arm around Alice.
They were both laughing about something and Jack noticed Natalie looking
uncomfortable as she watched Leon
holding on to Alice as they slipped
into the booth. 



&nbsp;

&nbsp;

� Natalie seemed
more pleased when Leon
scooted into the booth right next to her and put his arms around her shoulder. 



&nbsp;

&nbsp;

� �Jack. Why don�t
you go catch our waitress and order us another round of drinks?�



&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

� Jack reluctantly
got out of the booth and flagged the waitress down and told her what they
wanted and returned to find Natalie gone this time and Leon
locked in a passionate kiss with Alice.
Jack didn�t feel so bad seeing that Leon
was hitting on Alice rather than his wife. His buddy, Richard would understand
the situation he was in and would problebly do the
same thing to him.



&nbsp;

&nbsp;

� Natalie returned
from the lady�s room and waited for Jack to move out of the booth so she could
slide inside next to Leon.
Leon had
stopped kissing Alice by the time
Natalie returned. The waitress brought the drinks back to the table just as
Jack was getting back into his seat Leon
was smiling at Jack as if he were making fun of him.



&nbsp;

&nbsp;

� Leon
motioned for Natalie to sit next to him as he put his large arm across her
shoulder and pulled her to him and whispered into her ear. Natalie started to
smile and whispered back to Leon.
Leon shook his
head up and down and laughed making Jack wonder what the joke was all about.



&nbsp;

&nbsp;

� Jack finally
thought he got the joke when he felt his dick straining against his pants. Leon
must have noticed he had a boner and brought it to Natalie�s attention. Jack
was so upset and nervous that apparently he was excited seeing Alice
kissing Leon. 



&nbsp;

&nbsp;

� Jack started to
sip the new drink that was brought to the table as they women talked and
laughed with Leon.
Jack didn�t understand why Natalie and Alice were acting so gaga with Leon.
They were treating him as if he were their favorite celebrity! 



&nbsp;

&nbsp;

� Jack finished
that drink and ordered them another round. He was getting drunk and had to pee.
He slowly got up from the booth and walked to the men�s room. Walking back, he
noticed how close the two women were sitting next to Leon
in the booth. It wasn�t just with his wife but Alice
too. ! This man must have a lot of experience with multiple partners. 



&nbsp;

&nbsp;

� Jack was getting
drunk. He knocked Natalie�s purse on the floor as he slipped into the booth. He
almost had to crawl under the table to pick it up and noticed that both Alice
and his wife had their hands on Leon�s
thigh�s. Jack took a double take as Alice
moved her hand over the large bulge in Leon�s
crotch.



&nbsp;

&nbsp;

� What was Leon
saying to these wives? What sort of power did he have to make them act like a
couple of hot whore�s? 



&nbsp;

&nbsp;

� Jack picked up
the purse and placed it on the table. Leon
was talking to the wives and turned and looked at Jack.



&nbsp;

&nbsp;

� �I think you
should take your husband home. He looks like he�s ready to fall on the floor
again.�



&nbsp;

&nbsp;

�� Leon
helped Natalie carry Jack back to the car and put him in the passenger seat. Leon
stood outside the car for several minutes talking to Natalie until Jack saw him
give her a kiss on her lips again. 



&nbsp;

&nbsp;

�� Natalie walked
around to the driver�s seat and closed the door.



&nbsp;

&nbsp;

� �Where�s Alice?�



&nbsp;

&nbsp;

� �Oh. Um. Leon
said he would drive her home.�



&nbsp;

&nbsp;

� Jack couldn�t understand
it. Alice lived right next door to
them. They pulled out of the parking lot and saw Leon�s
car pull out in front of them and turned in the opposite direction that would
take Alice back home.



&nbsp;

&nbsp;

� Natalie appeared
to be concerned but not for Alice.
She seemed more jealous as she waited a couple seconds to pull out into the
road. 



&nbsp;

&nbsp;

� Jack was so drunk
that he fell asleep on the way home. Natalie woke him and helped get him into
the house.� She took his clothes off and
got him into bed and began taking her things off.



&nbsp;

&nbsp;

� Natalie surprised
Jack when she took hold of his dick and began sucking on him until he was hard
and mounted his dick as quickly as she could. She rode him like he was a
stallion. Jack held onto her ass while she bounced up and down on top of him.
Her large tits were dangling down in front of his face so he sucked on her
nipples making her more excited.



&nbsp;

&nbsp;

� Jack knew why she
was so horny. Leon
had gotten her this way. After five years of marriage, he finally found out
that his wife got turned on by black men. Maybe it was just Leon!



&nbsp;

&nbsp;

� �That�s it. Fuck
me! ..Squeeze my ass!� 



&nbsp;

&nbsp;

� She was talking
dirty and trying to get him to respond. Jack couldn�t help being so drunk but
squeezed his wife�s ass while she rode him like a bronco!� Natalie�s whole body began to shake as she
reached her first orgasm and started to scream.



&nbsp;

&nbsp;

� �Oh. Yes . . .
Give it to me . . . �



&nbsp;

&nbsp;

� Natalie was
lifting herself up off Jack so high that he got dislodged from her tight pussy
and tried to get it back inside her while she continued to have her orgasm.



&nbsp;

&nbsp;

� Jack started to
arch his hips up and worked up a steady rhythm until he shot his load of cum
deep inside his wife.� Jack began to go
soft as soon as he spewed his seed.



&nbsp;

&nbsp;

� Natalie was
disappointed and wanted more and got out of bed and took out her vibrator out
of the dresser drawer. Jack watched Natalie play with the vibrator until she
had another orgasm. Jack had fallen asleep as Natalie played with her clitoris



&nbsp;

&nbsp;

� Jack was awoken
by the sound of the phone ringing. He looked over at the clock and saw that it
was after three in the morning. Natalie answered the phone.



&nbsp;

&nbsp;

�� �Oh. Hi Richard
. . . Alice should be fine, she is
with a friend of ours and should be home any minute.�



&nbsp;

&nbsp;

� Right when
Natalie finished her sentence, Jack saw the lights of a car pull into the
driveway next door and heard a door shut.



&nbsp;

&nbsp;

�� �Oh . . . Great. I�ll talk to you, tomorrow . . . Bye.�



&nbsp;

&nbsp;

� Natalie hung the
phone up and turned to go back to sleep.



&nbsp;

&nbsp;

� �Who was on the
phone?�



&nbsp;

&nbsp;

� �UH . . . It was
Richard looking for Alice but she
just got home when we were on the phone.�



&nbsp;

&nbsp;

� Natalie fell back
asleep almost immediately. Jack knew that Leon
must have taken Alice back to his
place. He problebly screwed her! Well. At least he
didn�t have to worry about Natalie screwing Leon.
Everything worked out like he had hoped.



&nbsp;

&nbsp;

� Natalie and Jack
woke up about the same time the next morning. Natalie got in the shower while
Jack fixed coffee. Jack, walked out in front of the
house to get the morning paper and saw Richard standing in the driveway.



&nbsp;

&nbsp;

� �Hey Richard. Is everything OK this morning?�



&nbsp;

&nbsp;

� Richard ran over
to speak with Jack.



&nbsp;

&nbsp;

� �Yeah. Everything is fine. Listen. Alice
is still asleep and I got to run down to the hardware store and get a new head
for the shower before she wakes up. Can you keep an eye on the house while I�m
gone?�



&nbsp;

&nbsp;

� �Yeah. Sure. I�ll be right here until you get back.�



&nbsp;

&nbsp;

� Jack waited as he
watched Richard pull out of the driveway. He was curious about last night and
this was his chance! Jack ran to ?Richard�s front door
and slowly opened it and walked into the house.



&nbsp;

&nbsp;

� He slowly walked
toward their bedroom and saw the door was open. He listened very carefully to
make sure that Alice wasn�t awake
yet. He slowly walked and leaned into the doorway and saw Alice
was sound asleep.



&nbsp;

&nbsp;

� She was naked and
didn�t have any covers on her. She was sleeping on her side with her legs
curled up against her chest. Her long blonde hair was flowing around the
pillow. Jack almost felt like getting into bed with her. 



&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

�� Jack looked
around the floor looking for the dress and panties she wore last night. There
they were! On the chair in the corner of the room! Her heels were sitting on
the floor in front of the chair. 



&nbsp;

&nbsp;

� He had to know!
Jack slowly and gently walked into the room keeping an eye on Alice
as she lay sleeping just a few feet away. He eased himself closer and was able
to grab the black panties that were laying on top of
the dress and slowly backed his way out of the room.



&nbsp;

&nbsp;

� Jack stood near
the front door and decided to just take the panties with him and walked outside
and across the front lawn. Jack waited until he got into the house and examined
the panties.



&nbsp;

&nbsp;

� They were still
damp and Jack could see large white stains around the crotch area. He sniffed
them next! Yes! ....They smelled from cum! Male cum and very strong! There
wasn�t any doubt in Jack�s mind that he was smelling Leon�s
cum on those panties. He must have screwed her last night.



&nbsp;

&nbsp;

� Jack hid the
panties so Natalie wouldn�t find them. He laughed to himself as he thought
about Alice. She would be looking
for these and wondering if she left them at Leon�s.



&nbsp;

&nbsp;

� Jack didn�t care.
He figured he was in the clear now that Leon
got a little white pussy. Jack poured his coffee and began working on his
computer. An hour later, Natalie walked into the room dressed in tight black
shorts and a halter top with heels. She walked up to Jack and kissed the side
of his face. 



&nbsp;

&nbsp;

� �Honey. I�ll be home later this afternoon. I�m supposed to
go with Alice to Leon�s
gym and work out with him. He�s going to show us how to lift weights.�



&nbsp;

&nbsp;

� Jack was
surprised and shocked. He figured it was over. He stood up and followed Natalie
to the front door where he gave her a kiss.



&nbsp;

&nbsp;

� �Honey. If you get hungry, you�ll find meat in the frig that you can make a sandwich with. I�ll see you
later.�



&nbsp;

&nbsp;

� Natalie was gone
within seconds. Jack looked out the front window and saw Alice
getting into the car with his wife. His cell phone was ringing so he ran back
to answer it.



&nbsp;

&nbsp;

� �Hey. Jack. Did
your wife leave yet?�



&nbsp;

&nbsp;

� �Yeah . . . She
just backed out of the driveway.�



&nbsp;

&nbsp;

�� Leon
laughed into the phone.



&nbsp;

&nbsp;

� �Hey. Man. Why
are you so depressed? Your going to cause me to feel
sorry for your ass next!�



&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

�� �Did you fuck Alice
last night?� 



&nbsp;

&nbsp;

� �You must have
been sniffing her panties this morning!�



&nbsp;

&nbsp;

� Jack knew he was
just joking around but he also knew that Leon
was serous about screwing Alice
last night.



&nbsp;

&nbsp;

� �OK. I don�t need
anything else from you as long as your� little wife is on her way here.
Listen. Let me remind you about the money you owe me. Your
not out of this just because I fucked your wife�s girlfriend.�



&nbsp;

&nbsp;

� The phone went
dead and Jack through the cell phone into the sofa cushion. He was pissed but
felt helpless at the same time. He knew he would be in trouble if he tried
anything with Leon.
He thought how horny Natalie was last night and knew it was all for Leon and
not him. What was wrong with her? Why did she want that big black cock?



&nbsp;

&nbsp;

� Thank you for
reading my story.
