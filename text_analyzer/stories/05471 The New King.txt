The New King

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

������� The world has become
nothing more than a hollow shell.� It is
an existence that has driven many to insanity, and beyond.� A place of hate, murder and lust which
benefits only the privileged, for those who would control us, a new day will dawn,
a day were their own perversion will be turned against them, and the one shall
rise above them all, to guide us to a new era where the weak will be made
strong and whole, where the greedy and the despot and the corrupt will be
judged for their deeds and struck down.�
I do not speak of god or Jesus, these are characters of a book that was
created by man, just like every other deity, nor will it be a demon or
boogeyman of our nightmares.� He will be
one of us, born out of the bowels of society.�
He will suffer and bleed as a child and throughout his adolescence he
will be rejected by all accept the �losers� of his peers.� His entrance into manhood will be marked with
struggle, until he makes himself invisible to the world, invisible except to
those who like him, desire something better.

&nbsp;

To
you who frequent this site, and so far are disappointed by what you read, then
I have done my job.� Regardless of the
fact this is fantasy, know this.� He will
find you, in your sleep or in your acts of depravity it does not matter.� It will be like all your transgressions come
to the surface, drowning you in a sea of filth, and all your fears come true.
I, like others who are gifted with the knowledge of what is to come will pity you
in the end, but relish in the knowledge knowing that you are now warned.� Turn back from this practice of primal acts
and become reborn, become someone who will fight with us.� I do not speak of a jihad or a holy war, but
of a struggle to end our enslavement.�
Rise up and say no more.� 

&nbsp;

When
he takes over, �Oil, fast-food, AIDS and
others will be lay aside, struck down by his might, for he will not allow these
and other pollutants to haunt us anymore. When the new king ascends to rule,
their will be no segregation, the planet will be one, and unique at the same
time.� Those rulers bent on devastation
and destruction will be put down, will those who will join shall help carry
humanity into the ages. 

&nbsp;

I
leave you this.� A message that will save
you, change.� Give up this retardation of
human intelligence or be left behind.� He
will not tolerate this or any other act of idiocy.� 

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

YOU
HAVE BEEN WARNED.� TURN BACK AND EMBRASS
HIS WAY.� BE STRONG, BOTH IN BODY AND
MIND, FIGHT FOR CHANGE AND MOST IMPORTATNLY GROW.�
LEARN AND DISCOVER YOURSELVES AND OTHERS, THE WORLD AND BEYOND.� THIS IS THE MESSAGE OF THE NEW KING, AND HIS
WORD SHALL BE HEARD.
