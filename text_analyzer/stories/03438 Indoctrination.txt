Chapter 1: Dark Oak Manor

"Damn it!" 

Amber Brkich cursed out loud as she maneuvered her Honda Civic off to the side of the road. She had been cruising at a steady 65 MPH, listening to a brassy song pounding on her radio, when suddenly, the engine choked and died without warning.

"Shit! Shit! SHIT!"

She sat there for a minute, her hands tightening around the wheel. The rain outside beat down like a drum against her windshield. Car trouble was the last thing she needed. Amber was already running late when she left her sister's house up in Albany. Now it was getting dark, and the storm wasn't making the long trip home any easier. She pulled the cell phone out of her purse and began dialing her boyfriend's number before realizing there was no signal, then slammed it down in disgust and turned the key again. 

Nothing. 

The only building within sight was a gas station she had passed down the road, but that would be at least a two-mile hike. Worse yet, she didn't have a coat, or even an umbrella to protect her from the downpour. What Amber did have on was a tight-fitting cashmere sweater with a double v-neckline, a pair of heeled sandals, and black shorts that rode very high and loose on the upper thighs to reveal more than her father would have deemed appropriate. Obviously, walking through the rain to get help in this outfit was out of the question. 

Sighing in resignation, she switched on her flashers, then popped the hood latch and quickly got out of the car to lift it up, hoping that a highway patrolman would come by eventually. When she got back in the car, her body was already soaked to the bone. 

"This couldn't get any worse," she thought.

Amber had planned to stop by Rob's apartment on the way home to surprise him, and maybe have a warm bed for the night. Now she was sitting alone and shivering on a lonely road out in the middle of nowhere. She considered running out to the trunk to get some dry clothes from her suitcase, then thought better of it as the rain began to pour down even harder. Fortunately, it didn't take long before a pair of headlights veered off onto the shoulder behind her.

"Thank God for good Samaritans," she smiled, looking into the left side mirror. 

The other car pulled up along side her door, and when she saw the passenger window come down, she did the same so they could talk.

"What's the trouble?" The other driver was a woman. 

"I don't know!" Amber shouted into her car through the rain. "It just died on me." 

"What happens when you try the ignition?"

"Nothing, the engine won't even turn over, and I just bought a new battery too."

"Sounds bad," the other woman frowned. "Do you have a cell phone?" 

"Yes, but it doesn't work." 

"I don't live far from here. I can give you a lift to my house, then we'll call for a tow from there if you like." 

"That would be great! I hope this isn't too much trouble for you." 

"Not at all. You better lock up your car before we get going."

Amber quickly got out and closed the hood, then made sure the doors were locked, before getting into the other vehicle.

"Oh you poor dear, you're soaked," the woman said apologetically. "I should have lent you my umbrella."

"That's OK. I didn't even think to bring a coat."

"I'll get a pot of hot tea going when we get to the house."

The woman appeared to be in her early forties with fiery red hair that was shoulder length. She was wearing a long, black leather overcoat, and Amber guessed she had a nice figure underneath. A little too much makeup though, as if she were fighting off the inevitable aging that all women have to contend with at some point in their lives. Amber knew she would face it someday, but at a youthful 23, that was the very least of her worries right now.

"I really appreciate this," she thanked her again. "I don't know what I would have done if you hadn't come along." 

"It's my pleasure. My name is Sonia, by the way."

"Pleased to meet you, Sonia, I'm Amber." 

"And where are you from?"

"Pittsburgh. I'm on my way home from my sister's up in New York."

They turned off the main route, and then drove down one heavily wooded road, and another until they reached a large iron fence, shrouded in a tangle of trees and vines. A sign on the gate read, Dark Oak Manor. Sonia pulled up close, honked three times, and the gate opened electronically, allowing her to drive through. The road up to her house was unusually long, and cracked and crumbling with gatherings of running of water in some places. After the first bend, the pavement became more smooth and maintained. A row of posts linked by heavy chains lined one edge of the drive. Another bend brought them within sight of a large old house. The drive had now become pristine without any signs of age or wear. As they slowly drove up the slight grade, the trees moved aside to reveal more of the single structure, which had grown much larger than it first appeared from its concealment. 

"Take my umbrella and go in the house," she instructed. "Don't worry, the front door is unlocked. I'm going to park the car around back, then I'll meet you inside."

Amber did as she was told and quickly ran to the porch with umbrella in hand, only to find a man standing in the open doorway. The first sight of him startled her. 

"May I help you?" came the slow controlled query.

"Uh . . . yes. I had some car trouble . . . and Sonia was going to let me use her phone."

"Oh, of course," he then gave her a cordial smile, "please come in."

She saw his eyes dart up and down her rain-drenched body as he stepped aside to let her pass. Amber was used to the casual stares she often received from men on the street, only his look was more obvious, as though he were making an appraisal of what he saw with little regard as to whether it would offend her or not. Standing in a dark foyer, she chanced one look back outside before the door slammed shut. Warmth from the interior greeted and surrounded her, but she took little comfort in it. 

"My name is Shane. I'm sort of the caretaker here," he led her through a pair of double doors to a large sitting room. "Sonia will be in shortly, in the meantime, please make yourself comfortable," then he vanished before Amber could turn and thank him.

The exterior of the house was built mostly of stone with decorative stone tracery, much like the Old English Gothic homes of the 19th century, but the inside had everything that Victorian splendor and extravagance stood for. She could feel the heat rolling out of the vast, canopied fireplace. A massive chandelier hung from the ceiling, casting a dozen or so lights upon the floor below. Plush, velvet chairs and settees were grouped about the perimeter for private conversations. She had never seen anything like it -- certainly not in the little town of Beaver, Pennsylvania, where she grew up. 

Amber moved to Pittsburgh not long after she graduated from college, and while searching for her 'career job,' she had worked as a waitress, a librarian, then finally, an administrative assistant, which was really just a glorified word for secretary, or as Rob affectionately called her "office bitch." Her friends often suggested she try a career in modeling. Though Amber never took the idea seriously, she certainly had all the natural assets. Her alluring green eyes, long, wavy chestnut hair and fresh, unassuming smile gave her a girl-next-door quality that seemed real and attainable. Her body was slim, graceful and lightly tanned all over, and her full, young breasts stood out perfectly on their own, even without the support of a bra, making them the subject of many 'water cooler' discussions as to whether they were real or not.

As Amber sat in front of the fire, alone with her thoughts, she became aware of a vague, but growing sense of uneasiness about the room -- like someone was watching her. Glancing over each shoulder, she saw nothing out of the ordinary, but that nagging feeling still remained. She uncrossed her legs and shifted nervously in her chair, wondering where Sonia could be. When she finally appeared, Amber was actually relieved to see her.

"Sorry to keep you waiting," she said. "I had some trouble getting the garage door closed in this rain."

"That's OK, could I use your phone now?" Amber hated to sound rude, but she was getting anxious about her car.

"It's in my office upstairs."

Sonia led her up the long, winding stairway, then down a darkened hall flanked with rooms on both sides. Most of the doors to these rooms were closed, except for one, and as they passed it in the hall, a man's voice called out to them from within,

"Sonia, could you come in here please."

Amber followed Sonia&#8217;s lead as she turned and entered the room. The interior was full of books, spacious and restful, and very quiet, like the library of a millionaire. In a high-backed chair, behind an expensive desk, a man sat quietly looking at them. He had dark, almost black eyes, and long dark hair that was slightly graying at the temples and tied back into a ponytail. Tobacco smoke climbed from a lit cigar sitting in the ashtray nearby. There was nothing else on the desk save a large intercom and, incongruously, a very small ivory riding crop with a long thin lash. He closed the book he was reading and spoke to Amber,

"I've been told you are stranded." 

"A . . . yes," she answered awkwardly, "I just need to use your phone and call for a tow." 

"Well, I hope it's nothing too serious. Of course, you are welcome to stay here for the night if necessary." 

He smiled politely, but there was something about the look in his eyes that made Amber catch her breath -- something secret, forbidden that bubbled and frothed behind them. It was hard for her to take such a cold impression seriously upon first meeting someone, but the feeling was unmistakable.

"Thank you," she said politely, "but I noticed a motel about 10 miles up the road."

"Very well. I'll have someone drive you there as soon as they retrieve your vehicle." 

He then recovered the cigar and returned to his reading. Sonia was already leaving the room, and Amber again followed her down the hall feeling a bit odd about the abruptness of their dismissal. She realized neither had made any effort to introduce themselves, only in her case, it was out of awkwardness, while he seemed to have no interest in knowing her name. 

She was about to ask Sonia who the gentleman was, when suddenly, she heard the sound of the front door slamming, followed by the heavy thump of footsteps ascending the stairs. Sonia stopped ahead of her, and a look of irritation crossed her face as she turned toward the source of the noise. Another man rounded the corner. His raincoat was still dripping from the storm outside. 

"I wish to talk to you about the woman you sent us!" 

"This really isn't the time," Sonia broke in. 

"Yes, but . . ."

"I said LATER," she insisted.

His eyes turned to Amber then quickly darted away. "All right, then I'll take this up with our friend. Where is he?"

"Down the hall in his office, but he's unavailable at the moment." 

"We'll see about that," the man challenged and rushed around the corner toward the room they had just left. 

For the first time Sonia seem flustered and on the verge of emotion. "Please wait here," she ordered, and then followed after him. 

Amber could hear the muffled voices of two men arguing down the hallway. Then a door slammed, leaving her alone in silence for the moment with her racing thoughts. When Sonia finally returned, she had regained her composure.

"Now let's make that phone call," she smiled slightly. She reached up to take Amber by the elbow, but without actually touching her. The motion was more a symbolic gesture than functional -- something that hinted of suppressed urgency. Sonia ushered her down to the end of the hall, and into a darkened room to the right. 

Suddenly, as if from nowhere, Amber felt a hand grasp her upper arm from behind. A rag was then clamped tightly around her mouth, and she was immediately engulfed by a sweet, almost sickening smell of roses. She struggled and twisted with her unknown assailant, but it was no use; the grip was like a vice. Her head began to swim. Her eyelids grew impossibly heavy. Her legs gave out and she fell backward against the attacker. It was a man. His chest felt heavy and solid. Her tired eyes searched the room for Sonia, but she was nowhere to be seen. Panic became delirium, and then darkness descended on her like a blanket, obliterating everything around her before she crumpled to the floor.


------------------


At first, she was too weak to move. 

Her green eyes fluttered open softly, her thoughts disoriented, then Amber felt the first tug of the ropes.

"Oh God," her mind snapped awake, "what's happened to me!"

She was lying on her side with her wrists tied behind her back. More rope had been looped around her elbows to keep them bound tightly together. This pulled her shoulders back and thrust her breasts forward from the tension. Her knees had also been roped together as were her ankles, which were connected to her wrists in back with another short length of rope, forcing her body into a taut bow. Her lips were stretched wide around a rubber ball that was fastened to her head with a leather strap. Someone had hog-tied and gagged her.

"PLEASE let this be a dream!"

She quickly glanced around to see where she could be, but everything seemed black as pitch. For the moment, she lay there motionless in the dark, trying to collect herself while her eyes became accustomed to her surroundings. 

At first, Amber could recall little of what had happened, just bits and pieces that seemed disconnected. She remembered her car stalling on the side of the road . . . rain pounding the windshield . . . then another driver stopped to give her a ride. Slowly, everything came together like a horrible puzzle. Sonia. The house. A strong smell of roses that still lingered in her nostrils. Someone had grabbed her from behind and placed something over her mouth. Chloroform, most likely. As far as Amber could tell, there were no signs she had been raped. Her sandals were missing, but she was still clothed in her shorts and sweater top.

By now, her eyes could make out shapes and shadows emerging from the darkness. She appeared to be in an empty storage room that hadn't been used in years. Cobwebs and dust covered everything. The concrete floor felt cold and gritty underneath her bare legs. There were no windows, just a single door that was closed and probably locked. She heard a scratching noise nearby. Then something dark scurried across the room and disappeared under one of the shelves. 

"Just a mouse," she thought. "Or was it a RAT?"

Amber grunted and groaned in frustration. She twisted her body, first one way, and then the other, but the strictness of her hog-tie kept her pinned helplessly to the floor. 

"All right girl, get a hold of yourself. You can get out of this."

She closed her eyes and tried to relax, then focused her attention on the spot behind her back where her wrists were joined. Slowly and methodically, she began twisting her hands in half-circles, with the hope of somehow loosening the ropes so she could slip them free. Her wrists started to sweat, and Amber welcomed that, for she could use the moisture as a lubricant. She tried rolling onto her stomach to give her arms more freedom to move. In doing so, a stream of drool fell from her gagged mouth onto the concrete floor. Dust and mildew tickled her nostrils with every breath she strained to take in. Again and again she tried to work her hands free until her arms ached, but the ropes would not give an inch. Whoever tied her up obviously knew what he or she was doing. 

It took a greater effort to roll back onto her side again in her weakened condition, which she finally did so by rocking her body. Amber wasn't ready to give up, though. She squeezed her shoulder blades tightly together and arched backward as far as she could. Then with one painful stretch of her arms, she reached for the rope around her ankles and began picking at the knots. Sweat beaded and rolled off her forehead. Ashen dust clung to her tanned legs from all her struggling. Her back ached terribly, and she could feel her jutting breasts straining against the tight confines of her bra underneath the sweater. After several attempts, she realized it was no use. Her body had been trussed up quite securely, and tied off with small, angry knots that she couldn't possibly undo herself. Panic finally set in. She screamed into her gag until her vocal cords were shot; she struggled violently like a wild animal caught in a trap, until her body was too exhausted to move, then once again, she forced herself to relax. As much as she dreaded the idea, there was nothing she could do now, but wait.

About an hour had passed before Amber heard the sounds of footsteps approaching her door from the other side. A light came on and filtered dustily through the crack underneath. The dead bolt lock slid open with a loud metallic click, then the light flooded into the room and on her body as the door flew open. 

"Rise and shine, gorgeous." 

Amber squinted momentarily at the figure standing in the doorway. 

"The chloroform really does the trick. You were out for quite a while."

The figure moved in closer. It was clearly Sonia's voice, but not the same woman she remembered. Gone was the plain gray outfit she had on earlier. Now she was wearing a long, black velvet dress that hugged every curve of her body like a second skin, and with a slit up one side to reveal much of her bare thigh. 5" black heels accentuated the strong calf muscles of her legs. Her flaming red hair was swept up on her head and held in place with a diamond clip. A few stray strands of hair framed her face, making a sexy, yet elegant impression. She seemed much younger now than her forty-plus years. 

"Well, I hope you got plenty of rest," she said. "We have a busy evening ahead."

"MMMMPHFFFFFF!" Again Amber's cries of anguish were stifled by the gag.

"Temper, temper now," Sonia cooed. "Behave yourself, or I'll let this young man soften you up a little . . ." 

Amber hadn't noticed Shane "the caretaker" leaning against the doorframe with his arms folded across his chest. 

"Hmm, I'd like that very much," he grinned, his eyes fixed on her nipples, which were now poking outward against her sweater top.

For the first time in her life, Amber realized what it meant to be tied up, to be truly helpless and completely at the mercy of someone else. Summoning up every ounce of her strength, she strained and wrenched at her pinioned limbs, fighting her bondage with an energy born of desperation, not realizing that her twisting and writhing on the floor only made her body look all the more alluring to the wandering eyes of both her kidnappers. 

"You're wasting your time sweetheart," Sonia stared down at her like a cat studying its prey. "There are many ways to effectively tie up a human being, and I know them all."

Amber felt her face reddening, and closed her eyes, mortified.

"Now I'm going to take this gag off, but I warn you, crying for help will do you no good. Nobody can hear you, and it gets annoying after awhile, so I hope I won't have to put it on again. Do you understand?"

Amber could do nothing but nod in agreement.

"Good girl." 

Sonia knelt down while being mindful of the opening in her dress, then unbuckled the leather strap and removed the rubber ball. Amber hadn't realized how much her jaws ached from being stretched open for so long, and it was a relief to finally be rid of the damned thing.

"There, feel better?"

"Please, let me go," she pleaded. "The ropes . . . they're too tight!" 

"Oh, we'll be making some adjustments to your restraints, don't worry. But first, sweetheart, you and I need to come to an understanding." 

"Look, just let me go right now and I won't say anything to anyone." 

Calmly, Sonia shook her head. Her lack of concern about getting caught disturbed Amber almost as much as the situation itself. Then she remembered her disabled car parked on the side of the road. 

"My car!" she blurted. "A state trooper's bound to drive by and see it!" 

"Your vehicle was taken to a remote garage, just moments after I picked you up. It's being disassembled as we speak. In 24 hours the parts will be sent across the border into Mexico. As for your belongings, we brought them back here for safe-keeping."

Amber said nothing, but only stared at her in disbelief.

"And this," she held up a small metallic box, "this clever little device I'm holding is a transceiver. When activated, it sends out a signal. All I have to do is point it at a passing car, and the signal scrambles the target's engine computer, making the engine stall. A second switch here interferes with cell phones so they're quite useless."

"Oh God! My car broke down because of you?"

"That's right, but there's more to it than that. Much more." Sonia began to pace the room as she spoke, her heels clicking sharply against the gritty floor. "You see, dear, I am a mercenary, and a very good one at that. I hire out my services to the highest bidder, and I get many bids. The organization I'm currently employed with has a high interest in beautiful young woman like yourself. We've been watching you for quite some time, as we do with all our prospects. We knew where you lived, where you worked, we even entered your apartment and had the phones tapped. You were ours for the taking, and all we needed was an opportunity -- one that involved as little risk as possible. Then we found out you were planning to take a trip up to your sister's in New York. It was sheer luck that your travel route brought you within just a few miles of this house, so we were able to make the pickup there with very little chance of being seen."

As Amber listened, she could feel herself breaking down emotionally. Everything was happening so fast, her mind simply couldn't comprehend it all. "W-what are you going to do to me?" 

"I have no idea," Sonia answered casually. "I was only paid to bring you in. What happens next is up to someone else. Now if you'll excuse me, I have more business to tend to. While I'm gone, Shane is going to untie some of those ropes and take you to another location in the house. So mind what he says and TRY not to do anything foolish."

Sonia then stepped out of the room as suddenly as she had entered, leaving the two of them alone together. Amber feared the worst.

"Well, well," he said, "alone at last."

Her heart began to beat faster as he moved from his place by the door and got down on one knee close behind her. He was about 6 feet tall, powerfully built with sandy blond hair. Almost immediately, she could smell the strong, musky scent of his cologne. 

"I'll bet you're ready to get out of this, aren't you?" 

He untied the knots to the rope around her knees first, and took his time in doing it, occasionally letting his hand stray and brush against her bare thigh. Her elbows were loosened next, then she felt the rope that ran from her wrists to her ankles break loose, releasing her from her hog-tie. For the first time, in what seemed like hours, Amber was able to stretch her body. Finally her ankles were untied, leaving only her wrists. Then much to her dismay, he pulled out of his back pocket, a pair of shiny chrome-plated handcuffs. 

"Keep your hands behind your back."

Dreading what was coming next, she complied reluctantly as he untied the last of her ropes. She then felt the cold steel cuffs lock around her small wrists and ratchet down. She tried to pull her hands apart and felt the links of chain joining them go taut. A blindfold was pulled down over her eyes, and once again, Amber felt helpless. 

"Now stand up," he ordered.

She staggered to her feet, unused to moving about with her hands secured behind her back. 

"Come with me," Shane tugged on her elbow. The beautiful captive took a tentative step forward, then another, and another. When they reached the hallway, she was grabbed gently by the shoulders and forced to turn left.

"Just walk naturally. I won't let you run into anything."

Amber tried, but found it most difficult. She imagined with every step that she was going to bump into a wall, or maybe trip over something. She felt him pull her closer to his body. The smell of his cologne was so intoxicating she could barely stand it. 

"Stop. Turn right. This is your room."

Amber felt herself being pulled forward. After she took a few steps, his hands grabbed her by the shoulders.

"Sit on the floor with your legs out in front of you."

The only way to get into that position without falling was to kneel. Slowly she brought her right knee down almost all the way to the floor. She let it drop the last few inches until she could feel the thick carpet underneath. Her left came down quickly to join it. She swung her bottom to the side as she sat down. This left her legs tucked under her, but she had no trouble swinging them out in front. 

"Now remain still, and don't make any noise. Got it?"

Amber only nodded without saying a word. The door then slammed shut, leaving her alone in the room. 

The wait was long and unsettling, especially with the blindfold on. Was she really alone, or was there somebody still there with her? Watching. And what was going to happen when they came back? Thoughts of escape raced through her mind, as well as of family and friends, and whether she would ever see them again.

Chapter 2: Raven

Time seemed to pass like a glacier as Amber sat there alone and blindfolded with her arms handcuffed behind her back. She had no idea how many long minutes had gone by before someone finally entered the room. 

"On your feet." 

It was Sonia's voice.

Amber bent her legs underneath her, then managed to push herself up onto her knees and stood up.

"So far, you've been on your best behavior," Sonia told her, "let's keep it that way. That means no speaking unless given permission, and no outbursts, or I'll be forced to put the gag back in your mouth. Now, do you need to use the bathroom?"

She nodded tentatively.

"Then come with me."

Once again, Amber allowed herself to be guided and pulled around blindfolded. When they reached the bathroom, one hand was cuffed to a steel bar next to the toilet, allowing her the temporary use of the other. By then, she really needed to pee, but it was awkward, knowing that she was in full view of Sonia and anyone else who may have been nearby.

After her wrists were cuffed again, she was escorted blindly through, what seemed like a maze of corridors, then up a narrow flight of stairs and down another hallway. It was then, Sonia stopped and directed her to the left. Amber felt a flock of butterflies take off in her stomach when she heard muffled voices just ahead. Two double doors were opened and the voices suddenly died down as she was led into the other room. Somewhere off to her right, the heavy rain from outside pounded against a windowpane.

"Welcome to Dark Oak Manor. This is my home, and you are my guest."

She immediately recognized the man's voice. The memory of that awkward meeting, the smell of his cigar flashed through her mind like a hot lance.

"Allow me to introduce myself," he continued, "the name is Raven. You and I met earlier in my den, though not formally of course, and you are Amber Brkich, am I correct?"

She nodded her head slowly.

"And how old are you?"

"T-twenty . . . twenty-three," her voice was quivering so much she could barely answer.

"Please Miss Brkich, calm down. You act as though we're selling you into white slavery." 

A sound of low laughter filled the room. The butterflies grew even more intense. She guessed there were at least seven or eight people in the room with her.

"T-then why am I here?" she blurted out.

"That will be explained to you in due time, but for now, I must ask for your complete cooperation, and to answer my questions instantly and completely. Agreed?"

Amber stared into the darkness behind the blindfold, unsure as to how to respond. She had tried to keep her wits since this whole nightmare started and prepare herself for the worst, but everything was happening too fast. 

"Perhaps you don't appreciate the situation you're in, so I'll make it clear to you." 

The tone of his voice was deep and smooth, even fatherly in a way. 

"By now, you should have realized there is no way of leaving this place unless we allow you to leave, and you are certainly in no position to negotiate the terms of your captivity with us. Which leaves you only one option left, and that is to submit to me fully and do exactly as I say. If you don't, then I could make your stay here very unpleasant, and I assure you, the consequences you suffer would be far worse than anything your imagination has dreamed up so far. Do you understand what I'm saying?" 

Raven never raised his voice as he spoke, but the force of his words left Amber torn between the fear of him and the sinister implications of what he was saying. 

"I said, do you understand?"

"Yes. I . . . I understand." 

"And do I have your full cooperation?"

She nodded 'yes.'

"Good. Now Sonia is going to remove those handcuffs, so let's not lose our head and do anything foolish, OK?"

As she felt the cuffs loosen behind her back, Amber imagined how she must have appeared. She was barefoot, but still fully clothed, though what she had on couldn't be enough to protect her from the wandering eyes of her unknown admirers. Her black shorts left her long, willowy legs exposed quite generously, from the ankles to her upper thighs, and the light cashmere sweater she wore, with its deep v-neck, did little to conceal the shape of her pert, round breasts.

"Now turn around with your back to us."

"Please," she begged, "I-I really can't do this . . ."

"Amber," his voice grew loud, "don't make me punish you before we've even begun. Now turn around and face the door. I'll let you know if you've gone too far."

She took a breath and forced herself to make, what she judged to be a half turn, then stopped. Her mind was racing, searching for any way out of this. She even pictured herself, ripping the blindfold off her face and making a mad dash for the door, but she couldn't, for fear of what could happen next in the likely event that she failed.

"Very good, turn around again and face us . . . that's it, just follow my voice."

As Amber completed the turn, she could feel her heart beating like a drum against her chest. Beads of sweat began to break out on her forehead again. The heat behind the blindfold was stifling, almost unbearable. 

"That wasn't so bad was it?"

"Who in HELL did he think he was kidding?" she thought to herself, and then shook her head 'no' in agreement.

"Good, now let&#8217;s see," it sounded to Amber like he was reading a list, "height, 5 feet 6 inches . . . weight, approximately 120 pounds . . . measurements: 34-26-34 . . . are these numbers correct?"

She nodded.

&#8220;Born August 11, 1978 . . . attended Beaver Area High School, Pennsylvania . . . your were a cheerleader there . . . graduated from Westminster College in New Wilmington . . . earned a B.A. degree in Public Relations . . . member of the Alpha Gamma Delta Sorority . . .&#8221;

She nodded or whispered &#8216;yes&#8217; each time Raven asked for confirmation. Amber was shocked to hear so much information about her coming from a complete stranger, but then again, she apparently was not a stranger to them. According to Sonia, they had been spying on her for weeks before she was abducted.

&#8220;All right so much for the formalities,&#8221; she heard Raven set the paper down. &#8220;You are very pretty and sexy girl. Do you know that?&#8221;

Amber&#8217;s mouth opened, but she didn&#8217;t know what to say.

&#8220;Of course you do,&#8221; he answered for her. &#8220;One shouldn&#8217;t expect you to brag about such a thing, particularly in this situation. I apologize.&#8221;

He was patronizing her, but again Raven&#8217;s voice was so tender and fatherly, Amber felt her emotions relax a little.

"Now,&#8221; he continued, &#8220;why don't you tell us what kind of bra you're wearing."

"W-what?"

"Your bra, describe it to us." 

She stood there, dumbfounded, like a little girl with a dreadful case of stage fright. 

"I didn't hear your answer."

"It's . . . it's . . . black."

"Is it lacy?" 

"No . . . well . . . not really."

"Not really." 

There was long, heavy pause. Amber could feel the blood rushing to her face. It felt like a 105 degrees now under the blindfold. She had hoped that her answer would be the end of it, but Raven persisted,

"Do you mean only part of it is?" 

"Yes . . . part of it," 

"And what part, Amber."

"Around the top." 

"The top of the cups?" 

"Y-yeah." 

"I see . . ." 

Another pause. The silence in the room was deafening. 

"Well, I guess we'll have to just check to make sure your telling us the truth." 

Amber was mortified, "Pl-please. I'm not lying," and without thinking, she began to reach toward her eyes. 

"DON'T touch the blindfold." 

She froze at the sudden sharpness of his voice then let her hands slowly drift back down to her sides. 

"Now listen carefully," his tone grew softer again, "I want you to raise that sweater up and over your bra so we can see it." 

"No . . . I mean, I can't."

"Do it, girl."

"No!"

"Well, I guess you leave me no choice then . . ." 

His statement was simple yet effective, making Amber wish she could take back her answer. 

"I'm only going to say this once, Amber," he continued, "so listen carefully. Standing with me are two young men, both are very strong, and quite experienced in convincing reluctant girls like yourself how useless it is to resist me. If I were to give the order, then I assure you, Shane and Tony would take great pleasure in holding you down and removing every stitch of clothing from your body. Now, is that what you want?"

"Nooo! Oh, no!" Amber pleaded, almost unaware that her hands were now gripping the bottom of her sweater.

"All right then, go ahead."

She nervously ran her thumbs against the soft fabric, her hands shaking. 

"Come on. Pull it up slowly."

Taking a breath, she gently lifted the bottom of the sweater past her shallow navel up to her ribs. Almost immediately, she could feel the cool air wafting around her bare tummy.

"Stand up straight so we can see you." 

Her stomach muscles tightened as she straightened her back.

"There," he said, "that's good . . . now keep going."

She pulled the sweater above her ribs, exposing the bottom half of each full bra cup. Her face was flushed and burning under the blindfold from the tension. Somewhere in the room, a chair shifted, as though someone were straining to get a better look.

"Higher please," he pushed her, "all the way up." 

Again the sweater moved upward, all the way up past her armpits, until it was bunched up beneath her chin. 

"Mmmmm, very nice. Very nice indeed. Now why don't you take the sweater off altogether so we can get a good look at you." 

"P-please . . ." she whimpered, frozen in position. Her hands were gripping the bottom of the sweater so tightly her knuckles grew white. 

"Oh come now. You won't be showing us any more than we've already seen."

She gathered her courage, and without letting go of the sweater, crossed her arms to get a better hold, then pulled the thin garment over her bare shoulders. 

"Be careful of the blindfold," he reminded her.

Gently, she worked the neckline over her head. She could feel her breasts rise upward and push against the bra as she stretched her upper body. It was a sight that would have made any man, and even some women catch their breath. She pulled the sweater free and lowered her arms. Her long, chestnut hair fell loosely over her face, but the blindfold remained in place.

"You can drop the sweater."

Slowly, the garment slid past her fingers. The bra was a dainty, black number, just barely large enough to contain her breasts, making them bulge out of the top like a pair of ripe melons. Her nipples could faintly be seen through the laced material around the upper cups.

"Hmmmm, very racy," he said, "did you purchase this article of clothing recently?"

"Y-yes."

"And you did it to impress that young fellow you've been seeing, am I correct?"

"I guess so."

"How charming," there was a nasty tone in his voice that suggested a hint of jealousy. "Turn around for us, so we can see the back."

She slowly rotated her body again until she was facing away from the sound of his voice. 

"Now let's lose those shorts, and make sure you do it slow so we can all have a good look at that pretty little ass of yours."

Amber could hardly believe her ears. He was talking to her as though she were a tart, or a whore. 

"Did you hear me?"

"Y-yes."

Slowly, she slid the shorts past her slender hips to bring her panties into view, and let them drop down to her ankles. She stepped out of them. 

"Now sitting on the floor about two feet to your right, are a pair of black heels. I want you to put them on."

She hesitated a minute, then knelt down on the balls of her feet and stretched her right arm out to the side until her groping fingers found the heels. Amber then had to bend over with her tush sticking back towards her unseen audience while she slipped the heels on. Now clad in only her panties and bra, she stood back upright awkwardly in the heels, and waited. 

"You can turn around now," Raven's voice instructed her.

Like the bra, her panties were covered mostly in black lace, and cut high around the hips to show off the smooth curves of her pelvic bone before disappearing between her buttocks. She could almost feel everyone staring at her, their greedy eyes darting up and down her body as she moved around to face them. Again, her face turned bright red. 

"Yes, much better," he commented, "though it's unfortunate that blindfold covers up so much of
your face . . ."

There was another pause, and she could hear Raven whispering to someone else.

"OK, here's what we'll do," he continued, "I'm going to have you take off the blindfold, but you MUST keep your eyes closed, understood?" 

"Please, can't we just . . ." 

"Don't argue with me, girl," the sudden sharpness in his voice made her heart jump, "or I'll make this far worse for you than it already is." 

"I-I'm sorry," her voice quivered, "I promise . . . I won't look." 

"No, I'm sure you won't," his tone softened, "now take off the blindfold, and remember, keep those eyes shut." 

Amber closed her eyes then carefully pulled the blindfold off. It was relief to feel the air rush in and cool her burning face.

"There, much better. Now pull your hair back so we can see you."

She quickly brushed her hair behind her shoulders.

"Yes. Such a lovely, sweet face to go with that tasty body of yours. I'll bet you used to drive all the boys crazy back in college, am I right?" 

"No . . . not really."

"Oh, I'm sure you did," he surmised, "you just didn't realize it. Probably too busy hitting those books, I suspect . . ."

Amber heard his last words, but nowhere in her brain was there a coherent cell that could understand them through the humiliation and panic that was building inside her. It wasn't hard to imagine what she would have to do next, and the thought made her body start to tremble uncontrollably. Her breathing became more labored, making her breasts rise a fall invitingly underneath the bra.

"Now Amber," Raven's words grew louder and more pronounced, "what I want you to do next, is reach up and EASE the bra straps down off of your shoulders." 

"Please . . . don't . . . don't do this," she choked back a sob. 

"Would you prefer I have someone help you?"

Amber swallowed hard. 

&#8220;Go on . . .&#8221;

With one trembling hand, she reached up and slid the tips of her fingers underneath the strap on her left shoulder. 

"That's right . . ." 

She lifted it away from her skin, and pulled it up over her shoulder then let it drop so that it hung down loose against her arm, peeling back the top inch of her bra cup. 

"Now the other one." 

She did the same on the other side, leaving both straps dangling uselessly off her bare shoulders. Her breasts just sat there now in the cups of her bra like two full scoops of ice cream.

"All right, Amber," he continued, "lean forward for us with your hands resting on your knees and keep your arms straight." 

It took a moment for the last instruction to register, but then with her eyes still closed, she leaned forward and placed her hands on her knees. 

"Pull your arms in nice and tight. We don&#8217;t want that bra to come off, do we?" 

She squeezed her elbows inward, and in doing so, felt the bra straps slip even further down to her forearms. The tops of the bra cups fell back slightly as well uncovering more of her breasts, which were now crushed together like two balloons trapped in a vice. 

"Now give us a smile . . ." 

"God, why does he HAVE to keep tormenting me like this," she thought to herself, "doesn't he realize how horrible this is?"

"Come on, Amber. You can do it."

She managed to curl the corners of her mouth into a half-smile.

"A little more . . . that's it . . . let's see those pretty dimples."

Her lips quivered as she strained to hold her smile, and tears started to well up behind her closed eyelids. 

"OK, that will do. You can stand up again."

She relaxed for a moment, then slowly straightened up, being mindful not to let her bra slip any further.

"Now I want you to turn your back to us . . ." 

Again, she turned.

"and unclip your bra." 

Amber was in agony, but she took a moment to collect herself, then slowly reached behind her back and grasped the two ends of the back strap where the clasps were. She pulled both sides toward each other to release the tension, freeing two of the four small eyelets. Her hands were still trembling, so she had to do it a couple of times before they all came free. As the straps parted, she crossed her arms to keep the front of her bra from falling down, leaving the back dangling. 

"Arms down to your sides, please," he calmly ordered.

"Oh God," she thought, and slowly lowered her arms, but kept them pressed tight against the sides of her body so the bra would not slip off.

"Turn around and let us have another look at you, and make sure those eyes stay shut."

Amber turned around slowly. She could feel the salty tears streaming down her hot cheeks.

"Now, for the moment we've been waiting for," his voice grew louder. "Amber, I want you to spread your arms out just a little."

"No! Please don't make me, please!" she begged.

"Do it, girl."

The terror screaming in her ears nearly drowned out his repeated command. Suddenly, everything in her mind seemed to shut down, whether it was from shock, or just an unconscious attempt to block everything out . . .

"I said DO IT!"

Amber was only vaguely aware of her arms slowly parting from her sides. The bra moved down one inch . . . 

"A little more . . ."

Again she complied, and this time, it only took the very slightest move, then the bra suddenly slid off her breasts and dropped to the floor.


------------------


Raven sat back in the leather chair and nodded his head in approval. Even he was taken by the sight of this lovely bitch standing before them. Her body was almost completely nude with the exception of her panties, and so far, he liked what he saw. She had a creamy, light almond complexion that seemed to glow with youth and vitality in the orange light radiating from the fireplace. Her pert, young breasts were impressive for such a slender build too, and they stood out flawlessly from her ribs like a pair of ripe melons. Sonia, who was sitting nearby, gazed at them in admiration. 

There were six others in the room. The handlers, Shane and Tony, stood off to the side with their lusty gaze fixed on the girl's naked tits, while Len manned the video camera behind Raven's chair. The other three men, all prospective buyers, were allowed to sit in on the first session and watch for a modest fee of $1,200 each. Raven had no doubt, that once properly trained, the bidding would go high for the girl. Her body was certainly more than suitable enough, beautiful without question, though he had seen plenty of beautiful women come and go. But there was something special about this one that set her apart from the others. Her face was both charming and innocent, and she had an alluring, sweet sensuality to her demeanor that he knew would be very appealing to the buyers. Yes, he thought to himself, she was going to be quite a draw at the next auction.

"Now listen carefully, Amber," he leaned forward and spoke slowly, "I want you to stand up straight, and clasp your hands behind your neck." 

The girl hesitated for a moment, then she raised her hands behind her neck and laced her fingers together.

"Pull your elbows back, nice and tight."

Tears were streaming past her closed eyelids and down her face, but she managed to force her elbows backward so that her breasts were now drawn tight across her ribs. Her armpits were deep and smooth, and started to glisten a little with perspiration. 

"Now slowly turn to your left and face away from us, please."

She slowly rotated her body until she faced the door, and this revealed a beautiful, slim and flawless back. It was an exquisite shape, Raven observed. A long perfect symmetry, with a sexy backline that moved prominently down the center, almost to her firm, round buttocks. 

"That's good. Now keep those elbows pulled back, and slowly turn all the way around 
for us . . ."

Like a good little whore, she did exactly as told, giving everyone a lusty view of her outstretched body from all angles. By now, the cool air had done its work in making her nipples swell and stand erect, which only added to the poor girl's humiliation. The thought of how she must be feeling made Raven smile a little. He relished this part of the training the most -- watching a new slave gradually come to terms with her exposure, her captivity . . .


------------------


"Beautiful. You can put your arms down again," he said.

Amber was devastated. She let her arms drop down to her sides and resisted the urge to cross them over her breasts. Even with her eyes squeezed tight, she could feel the heat of their unblinking stares searing into her newly bared flesh. Worse yet, she knew the ordeal was far from over.

"Yes, very nice," Raven's voice sounded pleased, "I guess that just leaves one more thing to do, my pet, and you know what that is . . ."

"I . . . I can't do this anymore," her mouth felt as dry as cotton, so dry she could barely speak, "please, let me stop."

"Come now girl, it would be a shame to have to punish you at this point. Don't you think?"

"Please . . ." 

"DO IT." 

Amber took in a long breath. She then hooked her thumbs under the sides of her panties. The room was dead silent. With trembling hands, she slowly peeled them down her smooth hips and let them hang on her thighs. A slight shift of one leg, and then the other made the useless garment flutter down to her feet. 

&#8220;And step out of them."

Without questioning him further, Amber lifted her feet out of the panties and kicked them aside. Her pubic hair had been neatly shaved and trimmed close to accommodate even the skimpiest thong underwear. Now all eyes were focused on the one, most secret part of her body that few men had ever seen. Another rush of tears came, and she had to squeeze her eyelids tightly together to block them out. 

"Very nice. Now shake your hair a little for us."

"Please, let this be it," she thought to herself. Her silky hair brushed lightly against her bare shoulders as she shook her head.

"There,&#8221; he said. &#8220;That will do for now, my pet. You can open your eyes."

Amber hesitated for moment, unsure as to if she really wanted to see who, or how many of them were in the room with her. Then slowly, she relaxed the tired muscles around her eyes and opened them . . .

Chapter 3: Down the Rabbit Hole

Amber's eyes quickly skimmed over the people she was facing and stopped at the large canopied fireplace. She remembered being in this room earlier, that is, before she had been abducted -- ages ago, it seemed. She then forced herself to look away from it to observe the people surrounding her. Raven, she immediately recognized, was sitting in a leather chair at the center of the group. To his left, were three men she had never seen before. From their clothing and posture, they could have been anything from lawyers to construction workers. Sonia was leaning back on a plush, velvet couch with her legs crossed, and Amber couldn't help noticing how the long slit up the side of her black dress was now wide open, revealing most of her bare leg from the ankle to well-above her upper thigh. 

As Raven got up from his chair, he seemed to look different standing in full view before her -- tall and imposing. His dark hair was still tied back neatly into a pony tail, and there was a small scar down his left cheek that she hadn't noticed before. He crossed the short span of carpet between them. In his hand, he carried a leather-studded collar with two rings attached to the front and back. Amber took one step backward.

"Don't move," his words were hushed, but firm, "or I'll have the boys hold you down."

Directly behind her, Shane and Tony, stood by to assist Raven if it became necessary. Her eyes quickly searched the group seated in front of her in the hope that someone would intervene, but they just looked at her impassively. One of the men actually winked.

Raven moved in closely behind her and buckled the collar around her long, delicate neck. She then felt his hand slid down the center of her back to the upper cleft on her buttocks right at the base of her spine, provoking a fearful shudder. He was almost beside her now, and slightly back beyond her line of sight. Amber stood like statue while his fingers stroked and squeezed each smooth cheek. Inside, a delicious thrill coursed through her body, and her head swam with feelings of warmth and desire. For that brief moment, Amber felt very confused, but strangely, not frightened. Then he brought his other hand in front of her and curled one finger around the ring in front of the collar.

"So tell us Amber, are your tits real or are they fake?" Raven watched as she cringed at the suggestion.

"W-why are you asking me this?"

"These gentlemen behind me were wondering if your breasts are stuffed with silicon. So are you going to answer the question, or should I allow them check for themselves?" 

As Raven looked at her, Amber noticed how dark his eyes were, almost black and piercing. She glanced downward to avoid them, but the eyes were still there in her mind, like two black vortices, pulling her down to a place she didn't want to go.

"They . . . they're real," she stammered.

"Well, I'm impressed," his eyes never left hers, "though perhaps I should verify this myself."

A tingle ran up her spine as he tightened his grip on her collar, then ran the palm of his other hand up the front of her body and across her breasts. His fingers felt cold and callused against the velvety, soft swells protruding from her ribs. 

"Mmmm, very nice," his voice was low, almost seductive.

Indeed, her breasts were quite impressive for such a slim figure &#8211; not too large, about the size of a small grapefruit, and perfectly symmetrical with quarter-sized pink nubs protruding from the centers. She had no visible bikini lines, but they were slightly fairer than the rest of her lightly tanned body, making them appear even more prominent. He messaged them with his hand, then pinched and teased her nipples until they became erect.

"Very responsive, too."

Amber began to lose herself again. In her mind, she was trying to fight off this man's unwelcome advances, but she could feel her own body slip away and betray her. Raven noticed it too. 

Gently, he pulled her forward by the collar. 

"Now come with me." 

Sitting just to the left of them, was a long ottoman bench with thick, velvet padding on the seat. 

"Kneel," he pointed to the short end closest to her, "right here of the edge."

Amber raised her eyes to his, desperate to read compassion in his gaze, but there was none. Again, she glanced around the room, and for the first time, she noticed the video camera perched in its tripod. She stared wide-eyed at the glowing red light next to the 'record' button. 

"Oh God!" she thought to herself. "These sickos are taping everything!" 

Since her abduction, she had been tied up, threatened, and forced to strip in front of a group of complete strangers. Now for the first time, Amber felt anger so intense, it quelled any fears she had of this man and his threats of what would happen if she resisted. 

"I said KNEEL."

"No!" she screamed, pointing at the camera. "And if you expect me to just play along with this sick game, then you're FUCKING crazy!"

Her outburst took some of the observers by surprise, but Raven showed no emotion, no reaction at all. Every moment, he seemed to know exactly what was going on in her mind -- even when she would finally drum up the courage to fight back. Before Amber could say anymore, he yanked her collar backward in a move that was so sudden, and with such force, it threw her off-balance. She fell forward and landed hard onto the bench, knocking her chin against the solid oak wood underneath the padded seat. She tried to get up, but Shane and Tony were quickly upon her, holding her down. She felt one of them grab her ankles, then her arms were pulled forward by the wrists to the opposite end of he bench, until she was lying face down along the length of it.

"Stretch her tight," Raven ordered.

Each man pulled on his end so hard she screamed in pain. It felt like her delicate limbs were being wrenched right out of their sockets. Her nude body was now stretched taut and quite helpless. Looking up, she saw Raven looming over her. In one hand, he was holding a riding crop. 

"Do you know what this is?"

Amber stared at the crop, horrified. It had a handle made of ivory, its looped end was two inches long and one inch wide.

"This is used by jockeys to whip horses so they run faster. But I don't use this one for horses, Amber. I use it to discipline young ladies who don't show me the proper respect that I insist they do. I warned you earlier this could happen, and so far you've questioned my authority at least seven times, not including that silly outburst of yours just now. As punishment, your bare ass will suffer the crop eight times for each instance of your disrespect and disobedience." 

"B-but I did what you told me to do," she pleaded. "You can't do this!"

"Very well. That will be nine."

Amber turned her head away from him, only to see the others leaning forward in their seats, anxiously waiting to see what would happen next. She heard the crop whistle through the air, then a streak of fire lanced across the right side of her buttocks.

Whooshhh . . . SNAP!

Amber winced, but didn't make a sound. She was determined not to give these people the reaction they wanted.

WHOOOSH . . . SNAP!

The second strike was even harder, and it landed squarely on her left cheek. Keeping her mouth tightly closed, a little whimper escaped her.

WHOOSH . . . SNAP!&nbsp; WHOOSH . . . SNAP!
 
He quickly delivered two more very hard strokes, and this time, Amber screamed in pain.

"No more, please!" She wailed and bucked helplessly, her ass wiggling under the onslaught, forcing Tony and Shane to tighten their hold. 

"All right, young lady, that's TEN."

WHOOOSH . . . SNAP!&nbsp; WHOOOSH . . . SNAP . . .

She twisted her body from side to side, but there was no way she could avoid the crop. Each blow felt like a hot poker placed firmly against her heated flesh; but strangely enough, she was equally aware of the soft, velvet cushion caressing the front of her body. It stimulated her nipples as her breasts rubbed against the plush material. Even her pussy began to throb a little and grow moist. By the tenth and final stroke, her body was sweating all over, her ass, glowing a crimson red. 

"Are you ready to obey me, girl?"

"Y-yes," she answered breathlessly.

"Bind her."

Amber moaned softly in defeat as her wrists were wrenched roughly behind her back. Then something that resembled a black leather sleeve was pulled up her arms. It had buckles at the wrists, forearms, and upper arms. There were also two adjustable straps that went over the shoulders. She had never seen anything like it but quickly learned what it was for. As each buckle was tightened, she could feel her forearms and elbows being squeezed together. She then felt herself being pulled up off the bench and forced to kneel in the center of the room so everyone could see her. 

Her arms were now pinned behind her back, and completely encased in black leather from the wrists up to her armpits. Not only did the restraint make her arms immobile, but it also forced her breasts to jut outward toward her audience. Amber could do nothing now to protect her body from Raven or anyone else's attentions. 

"You asked me earlier why you were brought here," he said. "Now I'm going to tell you, so listen very carefully." 

His speech was slow and distinct. 

"For the next few weeks, you will be trained in the arts of bondage, sadomasochism, and sexual fulfillment. You will do exactly what your trainers and handlers instruct you to do. You will not speak, unless given permission to do so, and when you do, you will address us as 'Master&#8217; or &#8216;Sir' and 'Mistress&#8217; or &#8216;Ma'am.' During your stay here, you will be whipped frequently like you were just now, only with a variety of instruments. Your body will also be conditioned to endure various rope techniques and other forms of strict bondage. Above all, you will be trained to submit. Your hands, your mouth, your breasts, all of your bodily orifices with be available to pleasure those you serve. If you show any disobedience or hesitation, then you will be punished accordingly with even more painful lashings to the breasts, genitals, and other parts of your body. More serious offenses, such as escape attempts, will lead to long, painful torture sessions, if these attempts persist, you will be put to death.

"Your body belongs to me now . . . and I will make use of it. During the day, you will perform whatever domestic duties that are assigned to you, such as housekeeping, cleaning the grounds, and waiting on our guests. In the evenings, there will be parties, some here, some elsewhere. Your presence will be required. Men and women will be allowed to fuck you, and use you to fulfill any fetishes or fantasies they may have, and you will indulge them without hesitation. Nude pictures of you, and videos of your sessions will be sent to our clients. After your training, you will be sold at the next auction to your new owner. Failure to fulfill these obligations will result in your sale to an outside farm. That means I ship your ass to South America, or Asia.

"I know you will not wish to do most of the things required of you, but you simply have no choice. This is your new life. If you refuse to submit to our authority, then you will be punished vigorously, and I assure you, the human body can take only so much pain and torment, before the mind starts to weaken. My advice to you, is to accept your fate, and you will not suffer any more than you deserve. Do you understand?"

Amber was petrified at his explanation, sickened to the very core. The thought of being sold abroad . . . fucking strangers . . . and the whole S&amp;M thing . . . well, tears wouldn't help now. She tried that, and got no sympathy from this crowd. Her mind raced, searching for solutions, and finally concluded that her only chance for survival was to play along and hope that she would find a way out of this horrible place.

"Y-yes," she finally answered.

"That's 'Yes Sir.'"

"What?"

"The proper response is 'Yes Sir.'"

"Yes . . . sir," Amber whispered the last syllable shamefully.

"Good. So we understand each other," Raven turned to Sonia and gave her a nod. 

Sonia then approached her and quickly snapped one end of a long chain to the ring on the front of her collar. Amber remained on her knees, motionless, naked, and completely horrified with what was happening. She was leashed! She could be led anywhere they wished, like an animal, and with her arms bound tightly behind her back, her slavery was now evident to even the most casual observer. 

Raven spoke to her one last time, "I'm sure you will be pleased to know, that Sonia has accepted a full-time contract with us. I am assigning her to be your new trainer, and you will do exactly as she says. Understood?"

"Yes Sir." 

"Good." He then turned to Sonia, "take this one down to the rabbit hole. For now, I want her kept away from the others."

Sonia took the chain and led her to the double doors that opened into the foyer. Just then, there a soft knock from the other side. The door slowly opened, and a beautiful blonde woman entered the room. She was wearing a short, tight-fitting cocktail dress that barely covered her hips. In her arms was a tray full of cocktails.

"Oh," the woman uttered a high-pitched syllable as she almost collided into Amber. She then cast her eyes downward and spoke softly to Raven, 

"I bring drinks, Sir . . . for the guests."

"Very well," he answered abruptly, "bring them in." 

There was a look of annoyance on his face by this sudden intrusion, and the woman seemed to know it. As she passed, Amber noticed the particulars about her dress. It was tight and low-cut, pushing her fruitful, round breasts up and together. Her long legs were enhanced by the black high heels she wore -- much higher than what seemed fashionable. Amber also noticed a mark or bruise upon one of her breasts.

"Open your mouth," Sonia ordered.

Amber quickly obeyed, and again, a gag was forced on her, only this one was made of leather, and it covered her entire mouth with a small ball attached to a post on the inside to keep her silent. There was also an air hole in the mouthpiece so she could breath fairly easily. Leather straps fastened with silver colored locking buckles kept the gag in place.

She was then taken out to the main foyer, with Sonia leading the way by the leash, and Shane following close behind. A secret panel was removed behind the winding staircase to reveal a thick, stoutly built door made of solid oak. Sonia pulled out a set of keys to unlock the deadbolt. Then the three of them descended a long stairway to, presumably the cellar. Amber saw very little of this level however, for at the foot of the steps, they immediately took a sharp left, down a short corridor to a door that led to another stairway, only this one was very narrow and spiraled downward like a corkscrew. Sonia retrieved a candle lantern from the wall and used it to lead the way. Large, dark stones inset into the mortar gave the dark hole a dappled look. The air below was stale and moist, and slightly cooler as they slowly made their way down the steps. Amber was still wearing the black heels they forced her to put on, and without the use of her arms, she had to take each step carefully. As they continued downward, the walls began to ooze with moisture that fetid and clung to the masonry. Ahead, Sonia's black dress was almost consumed by the darkness, but her long red locks could still be seen in the dim light of the lantern, and occasionally, a single, milky-white leg would reveal itself through the open slit on the side of her garment. 

Upon reaching the bottom of the steps, they stood in a large room that Amber quickly deduced to have been a wine cellar at one time. On one wall, a rack contained tiers of empty wine casks, some broken with age, and there was a faint scent of stale wine that still remained in the dregs of those barrels. Sonia moved to a large, wooden table in the center of the room and lit two candles, bringing the whole room into better view. What Amber saw next, almost made her heart skip a beat. Hanging on the opposite wall, was large assortment of whips, floggers, masks, and other items her untrained mind didn't even recognize. 

"Bring her here," Sonia ordered.

"Mmmmmmmfffffffff!" she moaned through the gag, as Shane pushed her closer to the instruments that were obviously waiting to be used on her.

By now, Amber was so terrified, she hardly even noticed as they slipped the black high heels off her feet. Next, the leather restraint was removed from her arms, freeing them momentarily. Sonia quickly brought Amber's arms in front of her and fastened a pair of soft, yet strong leather cuffs to her wrists. Each cuff was attached to a chain, and the chains were fastened to a ring at the end of a steel cable. The cable ran through a pulley in the low ceiling above, then down to a wheel crank mounted into the floor. Another pair of leather cuffs were fastened to her ankles, and clipped together. After double-checking the bindings, Sonia signaled her partner to turn the crank. 

Amber felt her arms being drawn upward, higher, and higher, pulling them closer to the ceiling. Her ears heard every sharp, metallic click of the wheel as it turned. She felt her feet begin to leave the floor, forcing her to point her toes downward to find it again. Then the clicking stopped. 

Both trainer and handler stood back for moment to appraise the beautiful, naked form that was now hanging stretched and helpless before them. Sonia envied how well-toned her body was, and the way this woman's young breasts stood out proudly from her ribs even with her arms stretched high above her head. The shiny chain from her collar dangled loosely between them all the way down to her well-trimmed hole. 

Shane had other thoughts on his mind. He had become obsessed with this one since he first laid eyes on her, and though it was strictly forbidden to 'mix' with the trainees without Raven's permission, he knew there would be plenty of opportunities to ball this slut without anyone knowing. He had done it many times before, and he always knew what to say to shut them up after he was finished with them. Why should this one be any different?

"You look just about ready," Sonia mused, "just a couple of finishing touches."

She unclipped the leash from Amber's collar and tossed it onto the table. She then retrieved a black leather strap from the wall that had two cuffs on both ends. The cuffs were fastened tightly around her upper arms, and the strap between them adjusted to keep her elbows secured. Then she leaned forward and caught Amber completely off-guard by licking her right nipple with her tongue.

"NO!" Her mind screamed, but tugging at her bonds did little good. Though the leather straps that held her wrists weren't tight enough to bite into her skin, there was no hope in loosening them either. 

Sonia ignored her muffled pleas and took the whole nub into her mouth, then began sucking and lightly nipping at it with her teeth. The nipple became hard and erect under the onslaught. Amber then let out a gasp and bit her lip as Sonia placed a steel clamp on it, letting it slowly close to pinch tightly around her budding flesh. She did the same to the other nipple, and then attached a small chain to both clamps.

"Damn, it drives me crazy when you do that," Shane exclaimed, his eyes fixed on Amber's clamped nipples. 

"I'm glad you enjoyed it," Sonia's voice seemed mildly irritated by the comment. "Take the lantern and go back upstairs. I work alone here."

Shane gave her a look of disappointment, then without a word, grabbed the lantern and retreated up the stairs. "Soon I'll my time with this one," he thought to himself.

Sonia waited until Shane was gone, then turned her attention back to the struggling, naked girl hanging before her. 

ï¿½For now on, you will call me &#8216;Mistress&#8217;. Understood?ï¿½

Amber nodded.

"Good. Now let&#8217;s begin with your training."

Chapter 4: Lessons (Part 1)

Sonia turned the crank a few more clicks for good measure, then approached her new slave and tugged on the restraints to test them again. 

"Comfortable?" she asked. 

"Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmph," was the only sound Amber could utter behind the leather gag. 

"Of course you're not, but this rigging does accent your body quite nicely." 

Amber could see the mistress studying her with great interest, and shuddered when she licked her red lips, much as a cat might do before devouring its prey. 

Never in her life, had she been so helpless as this -- hanging by her wrists from the ceiling, toes barely touching the floor, completely nude and shivering slightly in the cool, dank air. Her firm, young breasts felt especially vulnerable now with her body stretched so tight, and the tiny vice-like clamps fastened to her nipples, made them a prime target for whatever inflictions Sonia planned for her. And finally, as if to add insult to injury, the leather strap fastened between her upper arms prevented her from moving her head forward enough to gaze down and see for herself just how helpless she looked. There was nothing she could do but stare ahead at the stone wall as Sonia paced in a circle, those cat-like eyes surveying her prize. 

"So tell me," she asked, "have you ever had sex with a female?" 

Amber turned her head and stared at her with a mixture of outrage and horror. 

"Just nod 'yes' or 'no' dear." 

"Mmmmmmmmph! Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmph," she cried, shaking her head. 

"I see," Sonia moved in closer. "I'm just trying to get a better understanding of who I'm dealing with, and you seem to be a very conservative girl when it comes to sex," she then cupped her hand under Amber's chin. "But don't let the question shock you, dear. As they say, you shouldn't knock it if you haven't tried it." 

Amber's heart began to beat faster. She could feel the first signs of nervous perspiration breaking out on her forehead and under her arms, but when Sonia turned her head to kiss her gagged mouth, she moaned and pulled away in disgust. 

At first, Sonia&#8217;s face betrayed no emotion. Only her eyes indicated that Amber had over-stepped herself. 

"Still the defiant one," she combed her fingers through Amber's long chestnut hair, "even now when you know you're completely defenseless. How very noble and stupid of you." 

In one sudden move, Sonia grabbed a fistful of hair and jerked Amber&#8217;s head backward, forcing her body into a back-breaking arch.

"HMMMMPH!" she yelped. 

"I do enjoy an occasional challenge, but just so you know, any form of disobedience will only make this more painful." 

Amber thought her spine was going to snap under the pressure. Her chained breasts were jutting forward now and dancing provocatively off her ribs as she struggled to keep her footing. Sonia maintained the hold with her fingers enmeshed in her hair. A wry grin played across her face and her eyes narrowed maliciously.

"Raven is paying me a handsome commission to train you," she continued, "so like it or not, you belong to us now, and I am going to take great pleasure in binding you and bending you to my will. In time, you will cry out and beg for me to satisfy those physical urges that I bring out of you. And if you ever disobey me, even in the slightest way, you will be punished immediately until you, screaming in agony, beg me to stop the torment." 

Sonia finally released her hold, allowing Amber to straighten her body again. While she stood panting for air, the mistress quietly moved to the table and opened a drawer.

"The human body is a remarkable instrument when it comes to sexual stimulation. The genitals, the breasts, and especially the nipples, are loaded with millions of nerve endings." 

When Sonia turned to face her again, she was holding a long, wispy feather. 

"Even the skin makes an excellent erogenous zone." 

Amber didn't have to question what was going to happen next, and for the first time, she realized the full scope of her helplessness. She looked upward and pulled anxiously on the chain; she twisted her wrists in the restraints every which way, but it was no use. 

"Your first lesson will begin with this -- a simple feather, plucked from a pheasant's tail," Sonia approached her, stroking the flowing plume with her fingers, "not very threatening when you look at it, but when dragged lightly across the flesh in just the right spots, its effect can be just as unbearable as the whip." 

"Mmmmmmmmph!" 

Sonia placed the feather against Amber's left wrist, then ran it slowly down the length of her arm. The effect was excruciating, the tip just barely touching her smooth skin. It was impossible for her to keep from flinching as it trailed into the deep, silky curves of her open armpit.

"Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmph!" 

"Ticklish?" Sonia softly taunted.

She dragged the feather up and down Amber&#8217;s ribs next, then across her stomach and around her navel, causing her to squirm frantically on the chain. 

"Mmmmm . . . Mmmmppphhh!" 

"This may work better than I had hoped," she the other armpit a teasing stroke.

"Mmmmm . . . Hmmmph . . . Hmmmppphhh!" 

Moving with the sinuous grace of a dancer, Amber twisted and swayed her lithe body, seeking shelter from the insidious tickling, but in doing so, only exposed new areas to be tormented. She felt the feather tip wiggle it's way up between her buttocks, then brush lightly against her inner thigh passing within inches of her neatly-trimmed bush. The chain, cord and pulley she was rigged to creaked under her weight as she struggled to fight off the relentless assault on her flesh. The feather swirled lightly around each breast until her nipples swelled painfully against the metal clamps. When she tried to roll her body away, Sonia gave her ass a painful swat with the palm of her hand, and when she turned back around to avoid another, her breasts were attacked again with the feather. Finally, Amber threw her head back and wailed, but only muffled mews could be heard through the gag. 

Sonia stopped just long enough to put the feather back in the drawer, then resumed the tickling by lightly scraping the tips of her fingernails into the smooth hollows of both armpits. Amber moaned and squealed behind the gag. 

"Mmmmm . . . Hmmm . . . Hmmppphhh!" 

Like an expert tickler, Sonia worked her long, red nails up and down her victim's body, lingering in spots that gave her the best reaction. She used a combination of slow deliberate strokes and light, fluttering movements with all ten fingers. 

"I can make you do anything I want. You know that now don't you?" 

Amber shook her head 'no' vigorously. By then, her skin was crawling all over with sensitivity. 

"Oh yes I can . . ." Sonia grasped the chain between her nipples and pulled on it, leaving Amber no choice but to arch her back and thrust her tits forward again. 

". . . and I'm going to prove that to you." 

Slowly, Sonia trailed the fingers of her other hand downward to tangle with the small tuft of dark curls nestled between Amber's thighs. 

"Ummmmmpppphhhhhhmmmm," Amber tried to pull away, but Sonia maintained her hold on the chain while she probed one finger up and down her slit, drawing a bead of moisture with it. 

"My, my," she remarked, "you're wet down here already." 

Sonia released the chain, then carefully detached the metal clamps from her nipples and gently massaged both breasts with her hands. 

"Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmm," Amber moaned. 

She felt quite embarrassed as her nipples became aroused again, tightening into fleshy, dark pink nubs. She could feel her entire body slowly giving in to Sonia's gentle groping of her breasts. She refused to show it though. Looking up, she twisted her wrists against the leather cuffs in a last desperate attempt to free herself from them, but her arms didn&#8217;t seem to have the strength anymore. Sonia only laughed.

"Are you not enjoying this little massage?" 

"Mmmmmmmph," Amber shook her head and glared at her in defiance. 

"I think you are, but you're just too stubborn to admit it. Maybe this will change your mind." 

She leaned forward and flicked her tongue lightly against each swollen nipple. 

"Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm," Amber moaned again. Her body began to sway more rhythmically. 

"Yes, that's it, just let yourself go, sweetheart," Sonia massaged her breasts again, kneading the soft, delicate tissue between her fingers. 

"Have you ever tried bondage when making love?" 

Amber shook her head. 

"I see. A first timer then," Sonia laughed. "Well if you had, then you would know that it can the most sexual experience a woman can have without intercourse. Like now, you&#8217;re feeling quite aroused, aren't you?" 

Amber struggled to fight against her own body's responses. She was enjoying it, and craving more and more. 

"Answer me," Sonia repeated, "are you becoming aroused?"

"Mmmmmmmmmmmm," Amber finally resigned herself into admission and nodded. She then felt one hand leave her breast and move down to her abdomen. 

"This is wrong," she thought to herself. She was repulsed by Sonia's sexual advances, but could not deny what her body was telling her -- that she was getting more and more excited. She felt the hand move in between her thighs, and again, tried unsuccessfully to wiggle away. 

"Struggling is not going to help you, dear. So why don't you just relax and enjoy it." 

Sonia found her clit and gently rubbed the tender bud with one finger. 

"Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm!" 

Amber could feel the orgasm building deep in her lower belly, a tight coil that threatened to explode within. She wanted to moan "faster" through the gag, but before she even tried, Sonia began to touch her in exactly the way she wanted to be touched. Then both hands moved around to her ass, and stroked both firm globes softly, before grasping them tight with all ten fingers. Sonia was on her knees now, and Amber felt her warm tongue, snake its way up her inner thigh, causing her muscles to tense. The fingers squeezed her ass even tighter, and pulled her hips forward, forcing Amber's pussy onto her waiting tongue. Amber felt it probe into her, deeper and deeper with each thrust, then it quickly withdrew and slithered around her clit. Mindlessly she tossed her head back, hips lifting to press her clitoris deeper into the wet maelstrom. 

"Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm!" 

Amber had never been this intimate with another woman before. In fact, if anyone had asked her a hour ago if she could be excited, sexually, by another female, she would have laughed. Now, this mysterious woman was filling her with a lust she didn't know existed. She touched her in the same places that men had touched her before, but in a way that none of them could ever match. 

"Mmmmm! Mmmmmmmmmmm!" 

Amber groaned loudly into the gag, then bucked her hips forward as much as the restraints would allow. She shuddered violently when the first wave of her orgasm struck. Sonia moved her tongue faster and faster, lashing out over her clit, then thrust it inward past her burning folds. Another wave followed, then another. Amber's mind tried to handle all of the sensory input, but couldn't. For the moment, she forgot about everything that had happened to her; forgot about where she was. She thought of nothing, but the pleasurable sensations coursing through her body. When it was finally over, and Sonia stood up again, she just hung there gasping, her head tilted backward, eyes half-open. 

"That is how you please another woman," Sonia told her, then her eyes narrowed. "But I don't recall giving you permission to have an orgasm, did I?" 

The implication behind her words sobered Amber up in an instant. Her body began to shiver uncontrollably, not because she was standing naked in a drafty room, but from the low tone of Sonia&#8217;s voice. It reminded her of Raven's tone, before he beat her with the crop. 

"For now on, you must never reach orgasm unless given permission to do so. If you do, then you will be whipped severely. Understood?ï¿½

Amber nodded.

ï¿½Being a fledgling, I realize you didn't know this, but nonetheless, I'll have to punish you for your indulgence, or else you will never learn."

Sonia unbuckled the straps behind Amber's neck and pulled the leather gag out of her mouth. For the first time, in what seemed like hours, she was able to speak.

"There," Sonia tossed the gag on the table, "now you can scream all you want, but I wouldn't advise it. No one will hear you through these thick walls, and you should save your strength for what's coming up."

Sonia moved to the wheel and turned the crank again. In an instant, Amber could feel the pull on her arms grow stronger, her body being lifted upward. The metallic clicks from the wheel rang sharply in her ears until her feet dangled in space. Pointing her toes, she searched frantically for the safety and comfort of the floor. Several more clicks rang off before Sonia flipped the lock on the wheel to secure it. The pressure from the weight of her own body increased on her shoulders and wrists. Her rib cage was etched from the strain, and her breasts rose and fell with each gasped breath. The cable had a deliberate twist in it, and Amber, now suspended, slowly revolved helplessly in front of the mistress. 

"W-what . . . are you going to do to me?" Amber croaked when she finally found her voice. 

"I thought that was apparent, dear. I had just said that you are to be whipped." 

The room spun slowly before her and she tossed her head around, looking up to her own bound wrists, then back at Sonia, and finally, to the long whip she was now holding. Her long, silky chestnut hair swung from side to side behind her as she writhed pitifully in her suspension. The whip was composed of black leather strands, braided tightly together with thin tassels on the end, and the length was about 30", giving it more reach than the riding crop Raven had used on her earlier. 

"I'm quite handy with this you know," Sonia said proudly, her hand stroking the long braided tail, "I can flick a fly off a wall with one snap of the wrist." 

Amber gave no response, but continued to struggle as she slowly turned on the cord. Sweat flowed fresh from her pores with the realization that she was truly hung, totally defenseless. She was really going to be whipped, and she knew it would be more painful than anything she had ever experienced in her life. Feeling the crop against her bare ass was bad enough. Now she was about to receive the same punishment all over her body. She wondered what the whipping would be like. She really didn't want to find out, but there seemed to be no choice in the matter, and most-likely, there would be many more to come in the future. Amber cursed herself for not trying to make a break for it earlier when her hands were free. Now she could do nothing, but hang there by her bound wrists, and hope that Sonia would show her some mercy. Her slavery now seemed all too real. The realization of her true plight was like a person coming out of a dark cave for the first time into the bright sun. It was agonizing. Amber tossed her head back again, closed her eyes, and moaned in hopeless despair, waiting for the first lash to land.

So many tears I cried of loneliness
I feel so hollow inside like a carcass.
Darkness is haunting me, driving me into insanity,
My life now shattered from all the pain.
Don't know where I'm going
But it's someplace new.

Chapter 5: Amber&#8217;s Descent

It was still pouring outside. The kind of rain that gushes over the tops of rain gutters, so much in a hurry to hit the earth, it has no time to flow down the spout. It soaked the ground to a mire in some places, and the ground, in turn, drained like a full sponge into a creek nearby.

In an old wine cellar, two levels beneath the house, Amber Brkich could smell foul water seeping through its ancient stone walls. The air felt thick and moist. She was nude, save for her leather collar and bindings. Yet in spite her chilled surroundings, rivers of sweat rolled off her body; sweat brought on by the strain of her suspension, and fear of the whipping she was about to receive.

Looking up, she saw her wrists imprisoned in their leather cuffs, her arms pulled high above her head by the twin links separating them. Her eyes followed the greased metal cable that ran from the chains, through a pulley above, then down to a wheel crank bolted into the floor. A leather strap fastened just above the elbows kept her upper arms secured, and her head back. Her ankles were cuffed together as well, and her feet raised 12" in the air, keeping her tight, young form stretched and exposed, and of course, quite helpless.

SWISHHHHHHHH . . . CRACK!

Sonia snapped the whip once into the air to test it while Amber slowly rotated on the twisted cable. The room itself looked old and ominous. There were no windows on this level that she could see, only darkened corridors that seemed to lead nowhere, and a narrow stairway spiraling upward to the cellar above. It was the type of place where one could easily be locked up and forgotten about for years.

"Well now, are we ready?" Sonia asked.

"Please," Amber begged, "I'll do anything you want!"

"I know you will, hon."

Amber strained to keep her eyes on Sonia as the cable turned until her back was to the mistress. She heard another loud snap.

SWISHHHHHHHH . . . CRACK!

The very end of the whip landed on the right side of her tush. Amber yelped, then lurched forward in her suspension.

"Painful isn't it," Sonia teased. "I hope you didn't think you'd be getting off easy because this is your first whipping."

SWISHHHH . . . CRACK!

The next strike was much harder, and this time, the whip curled itself like a snake around her wracked form and left a faint red mark just below her armpit. Amber screamed louder. Her tethered hands clenched into a fist, then relaxed. The searing pain was unlike any she had ever experienced, or even thought possible.

SWISH . . . CRACK!&nbsp; SWISHHHHHHHH . . . CRACK!

Sounds of braided leather slapping against her flesh reverberated against the stone masonry. Amber's head began to spin. Sonia had wanted her to learn the power of the whip, and she certainly did. She screamed again and again, her stretched body writhing spasmodically in its forced rotation each time the whip hissed through the air and struck her in a new place.

"Had enough?" Sonia asked.

"Yessss," Amber's voice was weak.

"That's 'Yes Mistress.'"

"Yes . . . Mistress," she begged, "I've had enough . . . PLEASE STOP!"

"Mmm . . . very convincing, " Sonia nodded her head in approval, "but I'm afraid you're not quite ready yet, dear. At this early stage, a slave will say anything to escape further correction, without fully appreciating its meaning." 

Before Amber could make another plea, Sonia swung her whip again, and delivered a series of strokes to her breasts. She hit each hardened nipple with stunning precision. Then she struck her between the legs, causing the beautiful captive to squeal and twist on the cord.

To Amber, time seemed to stand still, and the universe had shrunk to just two people. Sonia and herself. Life outside was now a distant memory, her clouded mind unable to focus on anything, but the whip. Amber wished she could escape the painful lashes by slipping into unconsciousness, but Sonia always knew just when to hold off until she had regained enough of her senses to stay alert. 

SWISH . . . CRACK! SWISH . . . CRACK!

The whip ravaged her body from all sides. When ceased again, Amber feared there would be more to come, but she was grateful for the momentary pause in her torment. Her mouth felt dry, and as she moved her tongue around, trying to find some moisture to apply to her lips, she tasted blood and realized she had bit her lip.

"How much am I hurting you?" Sonia asked.

"More than I have ever been before, Mistress," Amber answered her meekly.

"Then kiss the handle for me."

Amber fluttered her eyes open as if she had just awoken from a dream, and saw the whip handle only inches away from her face.

"Kiss the whip handle," Sonia repeated, "and thank your Mistress for the punishment that you have received."

Amber licked the blood from her lips, and then pressed them firmly on the leather handle.

"Thank you Mistress," she repeated, "for the punishment that I have received."

Tears streamed down her cheeks.

"Very good," Sonia hung the whip back on the wall, "but just saying that you are my slave, or even submitting to my whip, is not enough. A well-trained submissive willingly accepts her punishment without being forced."

Amber closed her eyes again and rested her forehead against the leather strap between her upper arms. Was this ever going to end? The whipping had already left her fatigued and deflated spiritually. Her skin felt like it was burning in an oven, and sweat glistened off her heated body in the dim candlelight. Though as painful as it was, the red welts left behind were only minor and would fade in a short time, thanks to Sonia's skill with the whip. After all, no one was going to pay for a ï¿½markedï¿½ slave.

"You are just at the beginning of a strange journey in your life," Sonia lectured her, "one that will change completely how you see yourself and the world around you. It doesn't matter how you were brought here. The fact is, you ARE here. How and when you wish to accept your new role is up to you."

Amber felt Sonia's finger stroke the outside of her left breast. She then placed the finger in her own mouth to taste the sweat.

"Now kiss me," she demanded.

Amber would never have thought of kissing another woman before, but this time she parted her lips obediently as Sonia pressed her's tightly against them. She felt Sonia's tongue slither into her mouth and wrestle with her own.

"Mmmm, very nice," Sonia commented. "I think you're going make a fantastic slave. And who knows? When you go to auction, I may put in a bid for you, myself."

Sonia gave her breast a final squeeze, then turned to the wheel crank. Another series of metallic clicks sounded, and Amber felt her body descend until she could feel the floor again, though she still had to use her toes.

"I'm going to leave you now to think about what you've learned so far, but that doesn't mean your first session has ended yet. While I'm gone, we'll be testing your endurance. Do you know what that means?"

Amber shook her head cautiously, uncertain as to if she wanted to hear the answer.

"It means you will be staying down here, just as you are," she said, "and I'm afraid this is only the beginning, dear. For now on, you will be spending many nights fully restrained in various uncomfortable positions. At first you will find it almost unbearable, but in time, your body will become more supple and accustomed to your bondage."

Sonia took one of the two remaining candles and moved to the stairs.

"Who knows? You may even grow to enjoy it," she then winked and said, ï¿½Ciao!ï¿½

Amber listened to the sharp sounds of heels clicking on the steps as she ascended the narrow passageway. Somewhere above, the door slammed shut, a dead bolt rattled, then silence. She breathed a sigh of relief in knowing Sonia had gone, and yet, dreaded the idea of being left alone. Shaking the wet strands of hair away from her face, she began testing the wrist cuffs with the hope of somehow loosening them, but it was no use. The leather was padded with foam on the insides, making them tighten uniformly under her own weight. She studied the two chains that ran from her wrists to the cable above. They could be unclipped easily if given the proper slack, but that would mean pulling herself up to the cable, and her slender arms were far too weak now from being stretched for so long to do so.

Once again, there was nothing to do, but wait.

Amber gazed at the instruments of torture hanging on the wall, and wondered which she would have to endure next when Sonia returned. Her eyes then turned to the single candle left sitting in its holder on the table. It offered just enough light to illuminate the center of the room, leaving corners and doorways shrouded in complete darkness.

Her mind wandered and recalled a dream she once had, where she had been kidnapped, bound and gagged, then taken to a warehouse. She had no clothes on her body, only the ropes. She was helpless then, just as she was now, like the pretty damsel tied to the railroad tracks in those early western dime novels. Only there would be no hero in a white hat coming to her rescue. She was now living a nightmare that her mind could never dream up on its own. Amber didn't seem to even exist anymore, only a woman stripped of everything and forced to come to terms with her own suffering.

The minutes crept by, and still, she hung, each breath a moan of pain and anguish. Her joints began to stiffen and her muscles ached terribly from the strain of her suspension. Sweat poured out of her body from a seemingly endless reservoir of cooling moisture. She could feel it trickling down from under her arms, down her back, down her legs, and between her breasts. It itched terribly! Then there was the darkened corridor directly in front of her, and every so often, an icy draft would whisk into the room from somewhere beyond its black recesses, and turn her heated skin to goose flesh -- a reminder of how naked and vulnerable she really was. She wished Sonia would come back for her, even if it meant enduring another whipping. The candle had already burned down to the end, and now its flame began to flicker and weaken. Amber watched it anxiously, and wondered if this was her fate -- to be left alone and shivering in the dark, with only the pain of her bondage to keep her company.

She groaned softly, then pulled on the chains again.


------------------


It was almost 3:00 in the morning when Sonia climbed the long, winding staircase from the main foyer to the second floor. She was anxious to get some sleep, but first, she had to meet with Raven and give her report on the new girl.

"Come in," a male voice answered after she knocked on the door to his den.

Raven leaned back in his chair and watched Sonia as she entered. Her red hair was pulled up, exposing her long, magnificent neck. The black evening dress she wore hugged her body to perfection, and as far as he could tell, there was nothing between the thin garment and her skin. 

"Good morning," he said, "please, sit down."

She sat in the chair closest to her and crossed her legs, not bothering to cover up her bare thigh as the slit in her dress fell open. Raven saw this and smiled slightly, then he got up and poured two snifters of brandy, handed Sonia one glass, and sat back down in his chair.

"So tell me, how is her progress?"

"She's coming along quite nicely," Sonia replied. "Much faster than I thought she would."

"Good," he nodded. "I may have to send her to Lamar Quinn as compensation for the other girl, though I would rather she go to auction.

"Couldn't Jerri be re-trained?"

"I don&#8217;t think so, and you saw earlier how upset Larmar was. Apparently she has been most difficult, quite impossible, in fact," Raven's eyes seemed to grow darker as he spoke, "so I've decided to make an example of her to the others, then I'll send what's left down to our associates in South America. At least that way we&#8217;ll get something back for the loss."

Sonia took a sip of her brandy and said nothing. She knew what the words "make an example of" meant when they came from Raven. She also knew any girl sent down to the work farms would have to endure brutal rapes, and long hours laboring in the fields. Most of the girls didn&#8217;t last very long in those conditions, but that was none of her affair, she reminded herself.

Such a shame, though. Jerri Manthey was a pretty one, and highly sexual. She also had a strong will, which is why Raven took charge of her training himself. He wanted to break her spirit, which of course, he did. Unfortunately, she had developed a strong devotion to Raven during their sessions. Something Raven, himself, had not foreseen until after she went to auction. When Mr. Quinn cast the highest bid, he became her new owner, but Jerri wanted nothing to do with him. She only wanted to serve Raven.

"Enough talk of business," he slowly rose from his chair, "it's late, and my mind has been entertaining other thoughts, such as that dress you're wearing. Very provocative, yet elegant, though at the moment, I would rather see you out of it." 

Sonia set her drink on the table and stood up as he approached. She knew how this meeting was going to end the minute she entered the room. Part of her wanted it to happen. She found Raven to be both handsome and threatening. His gaze in particular, was penetrating. When his dark eyes rested on something, they seemed to devour it, to encompass the whole of it. They were a predator's eyes, not human, and they seemed to blaze. Sonia felt drawn to them, like a moth to a burning hot street lamp. 

Raven curled his fingers lightly around her neck and ran them down her shoulders. His hands were rough and strong, but so gentle as they touched her, almost too gentle. Sonia knew that would change. Their eyes locked for a few pounding seconds, then, as if directed by a higher power, they fell into a hungry embrace.

As they kissed, Raven moved his hand down her thigh, and behind the slit that parted her dress so invitingly. Just as he had surmised earlier, she was wearing nothing underneath. Sonia moaned as he raised the dress high over her belly, exposing her smooth, porcelain skin to his wolfish eyes. She leaned back on the desk and relaxed her body back on the cool, hard surface. The dress was hiked up to just below her breasts, her knees spread wide and bent over the sides of the desk, her most intimate parts fearlessly displayed.

Returning his lips to hers briefly, Raven began a silent exploration of her warmth, traveling erratically downward, pausing to inspect her neck, her thinly covered breasts, her smooth, taut belly. Sonia didn't move; she didn't open her eyes; she just lay there, still savoring his touch. His mouth continued its slow trek downward, amidst the dark red curls nestled between her creamy thighs. His tongue explored all around them, teasing her most tender areas. Sonia drew in a gasp, her hands gripped the edges of the desktop. Raven reached up and pulled the thin black cloth over her breasts, applying friction to her hardening nipples in the cruel-but-oh-so-nice way she loved. The gentle hands became more insistent as she arched into them, moaning her encouragement. He twisted her breasts savagely between his strong fingers, until her nipples swelled and turned a deep red. Sonia cried out, her body writhed on the table like a helpless animal. Her fear heightened, only to be quelled again by her own arousal.

Raven's hands moved down her belly to her thighs, spurred on by the sounds of her pleasure. He spread moist open kisses along the crease of her inner thigh and looked up to watch her again. The sight of her mounting pleasure increased his already painful need. Sonia groaned, shifted her hips in an effort to hurry him, but he was in charge now. Her eyes remained closed, her hands tightening on the edges of the desk. She was paralyzed, unable to move, as though someone had nailed her body firmly down to the wood. She felt light kisses across her heated mound, felt him breathing in her scent as she bucked and writhed beneath the onslaught.

"Oh, please," she pleaded with a breathy whisper.

"Patience, my dear."

The warm rush of air from his words caused her hips to jerk. Light kisses deepened, his tongue snaked out to taste her inner lips. Small raspy cries escaped as Raven's fingers parted her and his tongue began slowly tracing the length of her sensitive folds. The intense sensation had Sonia mumbling incoherently, tossing her head from side to side as she clutched tighter on the desk. When her eyes opened, Raven was above her, watching. Bending forward, he kissed her face, tracing her lips with his tongue before sharing his own taste with her. He reached for his rock hard penis and dragged it slowly through her wet folds before guiding it to her entrance. One slow steady push seated him deeply inside her, the tight velvet of her heat surrounding him. Each long steady thrust sent her higher. Her nails dug into the wood; her spread legs tightened against the desk, until, crying out, her body clenched, then spasmed in its release. Raven panted, and hot puffs of breath assaulted her face. His hips jerked wildly as he emptied his hot seed into her, then collapsed his full weight on top of her.


------------------


Amber watched the candle die slowly. As the light wavered, moving shadows seemed to claw at her helpless form. She didn't know how long it had been, but it felt like hours. Her back and shoulders ached terribly as her own weight bore down on them. Her hands were already numb. The room seemed colder and she shivered occasionally, unable to avoid or shield herself from the damp, moist air.

And through it all, Amber's mind was grappling with growing thoughts of despair. The minutes had turned to an hour, then two, and there was still no sign of Sonia. She strived to keep a positive attitude, but the prospect of slowly wasting away is this black hold, totally alone, frightened her. Only Sonia could be her savior. But where the hell was she?

For a very brief moment, the candle flickered to life, and its light chased the shadows back into the corners of the room again, then the corridor in front of her brought another rush of cool air, snuffing the flame out completely. Amber tried to hold back the panic. Her nipples tightened, her skin grew cool and pimpled as the primal darkness swallowed her completely. Her blind eyes searched for something in the room to focus on, but there was nothing. She pulled against the restraints, gently at first, then harder and harder. Her mind began to scream,

"You can't escape. You are chained down here forever."

She tugged, pulled and twisted her hands against the leather cuffs, chafing her wrists terribly. She was aware of her body turning on the cord, her breasts bouncing provocatively against her ribs as she strained to keep her footing. She listened to her own ragged breaths and smelled her musky sweat. Then she went limp, breathless in her struggle against the leather and steel restraints.

And still her stretched form hung, silently suffering in agony. No conversation, no books, no TV, no sounds from the outside. She was only beginning to understand how empty her new world was. Her senses cried out for more data, for more input, anything to divert her thoughts from the loneliness, and the growing pain of her bondage.

Tremors from, what seemed like, extended hours of terrors had exhausted her limbs. Her bones felt thin and brittle. Her breaths now came in shallow pants, like a woman holding off the urge to deliver her child. Even her body deserted her now, and her mind sought to escape its confines and explore on its own. It seemed to her consciousness that she had separated from the useless sack of flesh, that her spirit, soul, whatever it could be, was free. Looking down, she saw her own body, adrift and alone in a vast ocean of blackness. Somewhere in her new reality, somewhere deep in its dark recesses, a creature stirred. Then another, and another, swimming around her form. She tried to warn it, but that would mean getting back inside, and she didn't dare. They had no glowing eyes. No muffled breath. No dank stench. But she could see shapes, predatory shapes plying the space around her body. One of the creatures closed in, but turned away. Then it turned back again. And so did she. She tried to fight against it, but something drew her back into the body that was about to be extinguished.

Amber got back just in time to see them close in, their sharp, razor teeth bared and ready to devour her flesh. For a moment, she couldn't remember how to breathe, let alone scream. She could make no more sound than a whimper that seemed odd and faraway. Her heart pounded like surf, sending blood crashing through her inner ears. Then the shapes darted off, but she could still feel them lurking nearby. Amber desperately wanted to leave her body again, but it was too late. She understood now that her imagination had tried to protect her, to get her free -- and had failed utterly. But she couldn't turn her imagination off, and now its efforts turned destructive. She wept without sound. Her thoughts turned inward, to the past, and her imagination selected only the worst parts of that. She watched all of the sins of her life. She held court within her own mind, and forced herself to see it all again in an effort to find the reason for why she was being punished. Her weeping never stopped. Her tears ran for days as she watched herself doing things that she ought never to have done. Every transgression of her life played out before her eyes in fullest detail, then culminated as her thoughts turned to Sonia. With almost instant clarity, she realized there was nothing she could do to change what had been done in the past. Only the present mattered now. More than anything, Amber wished she could go to Sonia, beg her forgiveness, and make amends for her own shameful behavior. She now understood the necessity of the punishment, no longer felt sorry for herself, and tried to focus on carrying out the full sentence, no matter how long, and how unbearable it might be.

The dark shapes were coming back now, ready to devour whatever was left of her old self. This time, Amber welcomed them before drifting into unconsciousness.

Chapter 6: Morning

Slowly, Amber opened her eyes. Everything was fuzzy, blurry at first, and she blinked as her eyes focused on the textured ceiling above. No longer was she hanging from a chain in the wine cellar, but laying on the soft, plush covers of an elegant four-posted bed. Every muscle in her body ached terribly. She tried to pull her arms down, then felt something tug on her wrists. Turning her head to the right, she saw her wrist cuffed to the bedpost. 

"W-what? Where . . .," she gasped as her mind slowly began to clear.

There was movement in one corner of the room, and Amber turned her head toward a man sitting in a chair near the window, his face, still concealed by the shadows. In one hand, he held a lit cigar. 

"Our pretty one awakes," he said.

"I thought I was dying," Amber murmured.

"Far from it, my pet," the man's voice was soothing. It was Raven's voice.

He stood up in front of the window, his dark form silhouetted against the early morning light. His eyes never left her as he moved toward the bed. Amber tried to get up, but couldn't. Her arms and legs were stretched wide and bound to the corners of the bed. She was still nude, defenseless and completely at his mercy. Then she felt his warm touch on her face, and somehow, it calmed her.

"Don't worry," he said. "I only came to observe. Now get some rest. I'll send a servant in later to freshen you up." 

He turned and left the room. The door closed quietly, and Amber, as exhausted as she was, quickly drifted back to sleep. 


------------------


In another part of the house, Sonia rolled out of bed and made her way to the bathroom. As she stood under the shower, she felt the heat of embarrassment add to the warmth of the steamy water. She couldn't believe she had let Raven fuck her again. She felt a little tingle in between her thighs when she remembered the way he had held her down on the desk. She remembered that animal look in his dark eyes as he pierced his cock into her. Sonia shook her head ruefully and wondered if she had made a wise decision in working for him. Mixing business with pleasure always lead to complications, and Raven was known to have a violent temper, and powerful friends. 

She stepped out of the shower and wrapped the towel around her body. Her damp hair was twisted together in another towel, piled high on top of her head. Searching the large walk-in closet, she pulled out the clothes she would wear that day -- a black silk blouse and shiny, tight-fitting leather pants. She then sat down at her vanity and stared into the mirror. Her face shone with the health and youth of a twenty year old. 

"Good sex will do that for you at any age," and a little smile curved her lips as she applied her makeup. 

For the moment, her worries diminished, while her mind took the opportunity to re-live the night before. God, what a rush! She let her fingers take over, each movement automatic, as she smoothed on foundation, followed by eye shadow, liner, and mascara. She pictured how they must have appeared to someone who might have stumbled into Raven's den while they were coupling. She imagined the look of his dark hair contrasting against the vibrant red of her own, her creamy thighs wide open to him as he surged into her over and over, her mouth gasping in pleasure. Oh yes, she was getting turned on just thinking about it. 

Sonia went to the bed and lay back on the satin sheets, allowing the towel to fall open. She glanced briefly at the ceiling, closed her eyes, and continued playing the mental movie behind her eyelids while her fingers slowly trailed down between her legs. 


------------------


Amber awoke again to a light knock at the door. Before she could answer, an attractive blond woman stepped inside and moved quietly to the bed. In her hand was a long leash. 

"My name is Monique," she said, clipping the leash to Amber's leather collar, "I have been instructed to take you to the showers."

Amber immediately recognized her as the girl she had seen the previous night in the tight-fitting cocktail dress serving drinks to Raven and his guests. Only now, she was dressed in a classic domestic maid uniform -- a short black dress decorated with white lace. She quickly unbuckled the restraints and guided Amber off the bed by using the leash.

"Where are . . ."

"Shhhh," the woman broke in, "you mustn&#8217;t speak. Now come with me."

As they moved down the stairway to the main level, Amber noticed the particulars about the maid&#8217;s uniform. The neckline was low cut and tight, pushing her ample breasts up and together. The dress was also short, and it revealed the majority of her long legs, which were covered in fishnet stockings and enhanced by the high heels she wore. Looking down at her feet, Amber noticed the ankle straps had small padlocks dangling from them. 

They entered the hidden passageway beneath the stairs and retreated back down to the cellar. Then Monique led the way through a long, narrow passage lit by an occasional bare bulb in the ceiling. The cellar seemed to span the entire foundation of the house above, though it was hard to tell because the whole level had been sectioned off into a labyrinth of small rooms and corridors, some sparsely lit in places. They turned into an open doorway and entered one room that appeared to be a lavatory. There were three shower stalls with no curtains, toilet stools without partitions or doors, and a long, trough-like sink along one wall. Amber also saw a large table, made of stainless steel with two sets of stirrups, one below and one high above. It resembled a gynecologist table, though this one seemed to have more insidious implications.

"Look." Monique's eyes darted upward to a surveillance camera mounted high up on a wall near the ceiling. "They have one in every room down here," she whispered, "and there is always somebody watching." Amber glanced nervously at the camera and got the message. 

She was permitted to use one of the toilets before Monique led her to the showers. The tiles were covered with grime and mold, but in spite of her disgust, she allowed herself to be guided into one of the stalls. 

"Please reach your hands over you head as high as they will go," Monique instructed. When Amber did so, first one, then the other wrist was secured to a metal restraint on each side of the stall. Using one foot, Monique urged her to widen her stance so her ankles could be locked in place as well. Then she turned on the hand sprayer.

The restraints were quickly forgotten once Amber felt the warm water against her aching muscles. For a moment, she wanted to just relax and forget about her abduction, the whippings, everything. She felt soapy hands gently scrubbing and massaging her scalp, then the sprayer, rinsing the suds off her silky strands. Amber never realized how much she could appreciate such a simple task. She stood immobile, her arms raised, legs spread, the soap running down her body, tickling her here and there on it's way down. She felt the soapy hands reach around from behind her and slowly lather up her breasts with the white suds. They kneaded and massaged them, turning her nipples into rosy pebbles. They moved into the deep curves of her open armpits, down the sides of her ribs, then inward toward the V of her body. She sucked in her breath and her knees buckled as the fingers worked their way in and around her nether lips, and deep between her buttocks. Every square inch of her was lathered up and rinsed thoroughly. Then Amber watched, somewhat dazed, as Monique went to a cabinet and returned with a razor and a can of shaving cream.

"What next?" she thought. 

Monique applied the creamy foam to Amber's underarms and carefully shaved them to remove any new stubble. Then curiously, she leaned forward and ran her wet tongue across each silky curve. Satisfied with the inspection, she lathered up each leg, from the ankles to the thighs, and shaved them thoroughly. After a final rinse with cold water, Monique returned the showerhead to its holder and unfastened the restraints. 

"Now step over here with me," she softly ordered. 

Amber was still dripping wet from the shower as Monique led her to the table.

"Lie down, please."

She followed her gaze and hesitated a moment when her eyes focused on the stirrups.

"Relax, this will be the experience of a lifetime &#8211; believe me," Monique took hold of Amber's upper arm and gently urged her onto the table. 

She quickly restrained Amber's wrists above her head, then she tightened a leather strap across her breasts, and another just above the pelvic area. Amber lay shivering on the steel table, but that discomfort paled in comparison to the mounting fear of not knowing what was going to happen next.

"I going to finish shaving you now," Monique's voice was soft and consoling, "and since this part of the process so exacting, it will be necessary to restrain you completely. We wouldn't want the razor to slip." 

She gently placed Amber's feet in the lower stirrups and fastened a metal ring around her ankles, so that her legs were spread out slightly and bent down at the knee toward the floor. A leather strap was then buckled just above each knee to keep them secure. 

"These will simply hold your feet and ankles in position." 

Bending down, Monique pulled a lever, forcing Amber's legs wide apart. It was not uncomfortable, but it felt very confining. She tried wiggling her feet and found there was very little movement possible. Amber could feel the cool air invading her privates as she lay there helplessly molded to the steel contraption. Her eyes darted upward at the camera perched high above her, its one eye, focused on her wet, naked body. Most-likely, someone was on the other end, drinking in the sight of her, and knowing this only added to the humiliation.

Monique seemed to sense her discomfort, so she leaned forward and whispered in her ear, "Believe me, the best thing to do is to simply comply with what they want." 

Alarms were going off in her head but Amber forced herself to stay calm -- after all, what could she do to resist now? Monique brought over a tray and a bowl of warm water. She then took a pair of small scissors from the tray and began trimming away the hair around Amber's privates. Her movements were slow and deliberate. Monique obviously took great pleasure in her work. Amber, on the other hand, couldn't watch. She tried closing her eyes, but she could still hear the sharp, metal blades go 'snip' . . . 'snip', and only an inch or so away from her tender folds. 

"This shouldn't take long," Monique said, "you're bush is already trimmed close."

After cutting away the hair, she sprayed some shaving cream into her hand and started rubbing it all around Amber's pubic area, making sure to massage the creamy lather all around her vagina. Amber then watched helplessly as Monique retrieved the razor and placed the cold metal against her inner thigh. It was like pure electricity shooting through her body, feeling the blade slid against her most intimate flesh, slicing through hairs and leaving the surface bare and smooth in its wake. Amber felt her nipples harden in spite of her wishing they would not. 

"I love having my pussy shaved," Monique told her with a deviant smile, "I was REALLY bad after they shaved me the first time. I couldn't keep my fingers off of it, so each night for a week, Master Raven tied me to the bed to keep me from touching myself."

Carefully she worked the razor up and around Amber's sodden lips, then gently pulled them aside with her fingers to remove the remaining hairs. Amber felt her body start to spasm as she pulled the razor away.

"Don't move," she ordered, "this is extremely sharp and I don't want to cut you . . ."

Amber tried her best to stay still but this resolve was tested severely each time she felt the icy cold blade between her legs.

"The sex is the best part of it, you know," she continued working as she spoke. "It increases the sensation when he's rubbing against you. I don't ever want to let my pussy become overgrown with hair again." 

Scrape and rinse . . . scrape and rinse. Again and again, Monique teased her privates with the razor. Doing it over and over, but not letting Amber reach her peak. Within just a few minutes, the part of her body once covered since puberty, was now completely bare.

"Finished," she finally said, much to Amber's disappointment. 

She carefully wiped the area with a wet towel, then rubbed baby oil around it. 

"This will soothe the skin," she said, "after the first couple of times, your body gets used to it."

More than somewhat shell-shocked, Amber didn't resist at all when Monique unbuckled her from the stirrups, then raised each foot and re-attached them to the stirrups high above the table. Another lever was pulled underneath, and Amber felt her legs being pulled outward, and then pushed forward, until her ass was lifted about five inches off the table. She was extremely vulnerable now, for not only was her pussy exposed, but her asshole as well. Monique applied more cream between her buttocks, then moved the razor around the puckered opening to remove any stray hairs. 

"How are we doing?" Sonia asked. She had entered the room just as Monique was toweling Amber off. 

"She is shaved and ready for your inspection, Mistress," the maid servant lowered her gaze to the floor.

Sonia ran her hand in and around Amber's smooth, open crotch and nodded her head in approval.

"Very good," she said, "now unstrap her and tend to your housework."

"Yes Ma'am."

Standing off the table, Amber immediately noticed how strangely different, even erotic it felt having no pubic hair. She usually kept herself neatly trimmed, but had never shaved it off completely before, and she was a bit shaken by her reaction to it. Like Monique, she had the urge to reach down and touch herself, but just as the thought entered her mind, her arms were immediately pulled behind her back, and locked into a pair of leather bindings above the elbows. A strap was tightened, pulling them tightly together, then a pair of handcuffs were locked around her wrists to keep her arms immobilized behind her back. 

"Now come with me," Sonia re-attached the chain to Amber's collar and led her through the gloomy rooms beneath the house. 

The entire level was relatively Spartan, with very little furniture in each private chamber, but what decor Amber could see was frightening enough. Hanging from the ceiling in one room was a steel cage meant to imprison a single individual in a standing position, with no room at all to sit or even move around in. One inch spikes pointed inward on all sides of the cage from top to bottom. The points had been filed down so as not to actually penetrate the skin, but were still sharp enough to give its occupant enough incentive not to move around too much. Most of the rooms Amber saw had different devices used for restraint - tables, racks, cages, and chains dangling down from the ceiling with manacles hanging open invitingly as though anxiously waiting for their next victim. 

Sonia spoke freely while they roamed through these rooms. "As you can see, the entire cellar has been remodeled into a type of mid-evil dungeon, fully equipped for the training of female slaves. This level, alone, is large enough to house at least a dozen trainees fairly comfortably, but generally we like to keep the number down to five or six at a time. In addition to our training, we also offer supervised sessions for our clientele. Down here, almost every fantasy can be fulfilled -- whippings, bondage, role-playing, you name it. Upstairs on the second floor, we have six rooms reserved for more private sessions. Discretion is guaranteed, of course, not just by the staff, but by the fact that a number of patrons are very wealthy, and would neither care for the publicity associated with the place, nor would they like to see its services disappear. You would be surprised how high the demand is for this sort of thing. We always have a long list of men and women waiting to get their little perversions teed up," she laughed. Sonia genuinely enjoyed what she did, and seemed to have no reservations about what might be normal or abnormal. 

She led Amber down a short passage to a door on their right. As Sonia turned a key in the lock, Amber thought she heard soft whimpering coming from the other side. 

"Here is an example of what we do here on a daily basis."

The door opened. Light spilled into the room, and on the pale form of a nude woman, left bound and alone in the darkness.

"This is Livia," Sonia announced, "one of our 'more advanced' trainees, and as you can see, we're in the middle of a session." 

The woman, a tall willowy blond, had on a pair of black high heels and nothing else. Her upper body was bent sharply backward over a large wooden table, with her feet planted firmly on the floor. Her arms were stretched above head and tied to the corners to keep her pinned, her legs fully extended and tied by the ankles to each table leg. A black leather hood covered her face completely, with holes for her nose and the long tail of her golden hair. A short silver chain connecting two nipple clamps glinted in the light from the doorway. 

"Livia has been a real treat for us since she arrived. She's quite leggy and versatile, don't you think?" Sonia moved in close between the woman's open thighs, "a real delight to work with -- and did I mention Leggy?"

The poor woman was in a desperately vulnerable position with her pelvis thrust forward so invitingly, and like Amber, all of her pubic hair had been shaved away. Her taut, stomach was adorned with a gold ring pierced into her navel. She also had one of those pointed tribal symbols tattooed down low just off her left pelvic bone. Sonia leaned forward, her leather-clad body pressed against Livia's bald pubis, and began running her hands over her breasts and into the smooth, deep pits under her arms.

"More importantly, she keeps her mouth shut and does what she's told. Very cooperative."

Amber could hear the rapid nasal panting underneath Livia's hood as one hand slid downward between her thighs.

"Livia has been with us for more than a month, so she knows the program by now, don't you sweetheart?" Sonia rubbed her palm up and down Livia's vulnerable folds. "She has no idea how long she'll be left like this. She doesn't know if I will stick a vibrator in here, or maybe up that sweet little hole in her tail. And does she realize what a target she is for a sound thrashing? Will it be the strap?"

Sonia reached underneath and caressed the tautness of Livia's butt, then abruptly pulled on the chain between her breasts.

"Or will it be more nipple pain?" 

"Mmmmmmmmph!" Livia jerked and whined, the noise rising as her nipples were stretched taut.

"She's now at her most extreme position for nipple torture -- her pinned arms stretching her breasts as tightly as possible across the chest. Perhaps we should hang weights on the other end of this chain? What do you think, sweetheart?" 

There was a shake of the head and a moan. Sonia meanwhile had released the chain and continued massaging her thighs.

Amber watched in both fascination and horror. She could feel her own body react to what she was seeing. She desperately wanted to touch herself, and quietly fought against the bindings around her arms.

"Mmph! Mmph! Mmph!" Livia moaned. She was beginning to struggle and quiver, striving to extract more from Sonia's gently tantalizing fingers. Sonia laughed and pulled her hand away.

"Not yet, dear. You still have a long way to go before that. After all, it's better to travel hopefully than to arrive, isn't that what they say?" 

The prisoner shook her head in a desperate whining plea. The constant stimulation made her pink folds swell and recede, exposing her clit like a shiny pearl. Sonia tweaked it lightly with one fingernail, soliciting a tortured moan from the bound woman. She tweaked it again, and another moan followed. By now Livia's thin, supple body was covered with sweat. It made her fair skin shine like a porcelain china doll. The veins popped in her neck and she was wheezing and coughing under the hood. 

"When you are in pain," she said to Amber, "your thoughts, your awareness become focused on the sensation. Bondage in its most strict form, increases that awareness because it eliminates your ability to move your limbs, forcing you to zero in on your feelings. This is only one aspect . . . but an important one. Livia, for example, has a very busy mind; always ruminating over one thing or another. That is the purpose of our session here. Now she is completely oblivious to her surroundings, aware of only her pain, her predicament, the power of her restraints, and of course, what I'm doing to her down here."

Livia was bucking and writhing uncontrollably now, and all the while, Sonia's fingers never left her clit. Amber wanted to turn away, but she couldn't. Like passing a fatal car wreck, she felt compelled to watch, unable to take her eyes off the site of this poor woman's suffering. 

"I believe my girl is almost ready, just a little while longer and we'll finish our session."

Then Sonia finally released her and guided Amber out of the room, leaving Livia panting and whimpering alone in the darkness.

Sonia continued her speech as they walked, "Throughout your training, you will learn how pain and pleasure can be one of the same, and to embrace them both. In time, you will find that your physical reactions, your arousal, can be spurred immediately by the slap of a paddle, or the pinch of a clamp."

They turned a corner, then another to a long corridor where doors succeeded doors, all fashioned with spy holes and keyed locks. Amber wondered if there were other women, like Livia, being tortured behind those doors. Then they stopped and turned into one of the rooms. It was cramped, grimy and oppressive, with just enough space for a small bed and a toilet. There were no windows, only four concrete block walls and a steel faced door. A single naked bulb hung down from the ceiling that made it all look extremely seedy. The bed was nothing more than an old worn mattress. Leather cuffs were fastened to metal rings welded into the corners of the metal bed frame. Amber also noticed a ring bolt set into the wall, most-likely so the occupant could be chained there and still be able to reach the toilet.

"These are your quarters," Sonia told her as she removed the bindings from Amber's arms. "For now, you will be restrained to the bed at all times until I decide you can be trusted to use the facilities on your own. Understood?"

"Yes Ma'am," Amber answered.

"Also, you will not be permitted to wear any clothing, especially while you are in training. This rule applies to all new slaves. In time, you may be allowed to wear something while doing your chores, or when entertaining clients, but you will have to earn that right. Any questions?"

"Yes Ma'am . . . I mean, may I speak, Mistress?" 

"Go ahead."

"What . . . what if I have to go to the bathroom?"

"Monique or one our handlers will check on you periodically. You can ask for permission then."

"Yes, Mistress."

"Good. Now get down on your knees, and put your hands, palms down in front of you."

Amber carefully knelt down on the cold floor until she was on her hands and knees.

"Move your arms forward a little more," Sonia ordered, "that's it, and spread those knees wider. Good. Now lower your elbows to the floor."

Amber hesitated when she heard the last order, but only for a minute, then she dropped down to her elbows. 

"Arch your back a little so I can see that pretty ass of yours . . . that's it."

Her nose was now less than three inches from the floor and Amber could see nothing else. It wasn't hard to imagine how she looked though. Her knees were spread wide, her pert ass turned upward invitingly with her back arched. Her nipples grew taut as they brushed against the gritty concrete, and both of her holes, now exposed, felt cool and vulnerable.

"This is called 'presenting', and in the future, when I tell you to 'present', you'll know exactly what to do. Won't you, sweetheart?" 

"Yes, Ma'am." 

Amber closed her eyes tight, but didn't move, as Sonia ran her hand up and down her smooth crotch.

"A good slave not only does what she is told, but she takes pleasure in it. She expects and wishes nothing more for herself than to please the one she serves. Do you understand what I'm saying?"

"Yes, Ma'am, I do." Amber answered. Her own voice seemed far away.

"Good girl. Now get up and lie down on the bed so I can bind you."

Sonia locked Amber's wrists and ankles into the restraints. She was now lying spread-eagled on the mattress and feeling just as helpless as before, but in a different way. 

"Poor Livia must be getting impatient with me by now," Sonia's voice chimed, "so I'm going to have you wait here until I finish with her. In the meantime, someone will bring in your food, then I suggest you get some rest. You'll need it."

Only a few minutes had passed after Sonia left before Monique entered the room carrying a tray of water and a covered bowl of what appeared to be stew. Amber was released from her restraints just long enough to eat. As she picked up her spoon and tried a bite of the stew. She chewed it and then swallowed with a measure of some surprise. It was actually quite good. At least she wasn't going to starve. She then realized how famished she was and dug into the meal with gusto. Once finished, her wrists and ankles were fastened to the bed again, then Monique took the tray and left the room, shutting off the light and closing the door behind her.

Lying on the bed, alone in the darkness, and silence, Amber thought of the other girl, Livia, and wondered what she was going through at the moment. She thought of Monique, who had not only accepted her role, but seemed quite content with it. Was she here of her own free will? Or had she been abducted too? 

Amber raised her head as much as the restraints would allow, and gazed down at herself, stretched and naked on the mattress. It almost felt liberating not to have any hair down there -- it really made her feel sexy. Her vagina looked smooth and clean, like a blank canvas on display, ready for someone to leave his mark. She gently pulled on the restraints, first one wrist then the other. How strange it was not to have the use of her own hands, for her own privates to be completely inaccessible to her, and at the same time, open to anyone else. 

"To resist . . . or not to resist. That is the question," she whispered to herself with bitter amusement at her paraphrasing of William Shakespeare. 

A shiver ran through her body -- a combination of the chill that seemed to permeate the concrete walls around her, and the vivid memory of hanging alone in that dank wine cellar the night before, her flesh still burning with welts from her first whipping. She remembered the hallucinations she had; of the dark creatures that seemed so real as they circled and closed in around her helpless form. It seemed a part of herself had been lost then, leaving a void of stirring emotions that seemed out of control. Passion, sorrow, fear, and anticipation, all were amalgamating into something more primal that she could not yet comprehend. Amber wanted to explore this part of herself, but at the same time, feared that she would never be the same again if she did.


------------------


The Observation Center, or more commonly referred to as "OC", was really just one room, about eight feet square in size, but arguably the most important component in the daily operations of Dark Oak Manor. Six monitors were mounted into one wall on which every "common area" in the whole house could be viewed by closed circuit television in both infra red and normal light. It had taken a while for Raven and Shane to get the cabling for this sussed out, but it came in kitset form, with relatively easy-to-understand instructions. No doubt, it came with an easy-to-read price tag as well, but the investors had deep pockets, so getting the financing needed for renovations was never a problem. 

This closed circuit television system, coupled with a two-way intercom, allowed anyone in the OC to deal with several training or client-related sessions at a time in different rooms. There were also security cameras in the grounds and at the gate, to check on the arrival and departure of guests, and for security in general.

That evening, while Amber slept, Shane sat alone in the room and watched her on one of the monitors. The infrared was activated, so he could see her even with the lights out in her cell. He turned a dial slowly on the control panel. The camera lens zoomed in close and panned over her body.

"Hmmm nice," he commented out loud to no one. 

Shane had planned to make a move on this one soon. The girls were always easier to deal with during the early stages of their training when they were still terrified and confused. Like the others, he would arrange their little encounter on one of his overnight shifts while everyone else was asleep. That way he could take his time with her. Of course, it would all be recorded, but that could be fixed easily enough. All he had to do was switch the tape with one of the older cassettes. No one bothered to check them anyway, and they were always rotated and recycled every five days. Very little could go wrong.

"Man, I love this job!"

He leaned back in his chair and smiled at the screen.

Chapter 7: Jerri Takes a Whipping

Amber had no idea how much time had passed before she fell into a dreamless sleep.

Well, not quite dreamless.

She remembered being trapped in a cave. She was hanging naked off a single rope by her wrists, and surrounded by gray bats. Yes, gray bats. They were flitting about, touching every part of her body, their wings tickling her bare flesh in much the same way Sonia had tickled her with the feather. In the dream, they began nipping and biting her, and she could do nothing, but wiggle helplessly in the dark, unable to escape their tiny, razor-sharp teeth. She became weak and lethargic as the blood from her many wounds flowed into their hungry mouths. Amber's memory got very foggy after that, but the dream seemed to end with her passing out from the attack, while simultaneously being swept by what she could only surmise to be a wave of sexual bliss. She awoke with a start, then spent the remainder of her time staring up at the dark ceiling of her holding cell, her mind filled with a dizzying array of thoughts. 

It wasn't long before the door opened and warm light funneled in from the hall onto her naked form lying on the bed. It was Sonia. Without saying a word, she unfastened Amber's wrists and ankles from the bed frame, then led her down the corridor to another part of the cellar. The tortuous maze seemed to engulf them, and before Amber knew it, she was hopelessly lost in twisting, turning passages, suffused with the glow of distant light.

They ended up in a room that seemed much larger than the labyrinth of cramped spaces that partitioned the whole level underneath the house. Small torches flickered off the concrete block walls, making it appear very much like one of those old English movies where torture chambers were the norm. Amber then saw the woman seated on her knees in the middle of the room. She was a stunning brunette with high, softly chiseled cheekbones, pale blue eyes, and long brown hair that spilled over her shoulders in graceful curls. Her lightly bronzed skin looked smooth, vibrant and flawless in the dim torchlight. The slip she wore was of plain white silk that barely covered her decently around the thighs. Her nipples, cool and erect, pushed outward against the thin material. Two chains with manacles hung down from the ceiling to each side of her. For long moments, Amber could do nothing but stare. She knew something horrible was going to happen to this woman. 

Monique stood behind a long table. Her attention had been focused on the careful task of cleaning and oiling the leather instruments of discipline laid out in front of her. Gone was the servant's uniform. She was naked now, like Amber, and wearing a leather collar. Lamar Quinn stood nearby. Amber remembered seeing this man that first evening she arrived at the house, and quickly deduced that the argument she overheard between he and Raven had something to do with the woman kneeling on the floor.

"Sit," Sonia ordered and motioned Amber to a plain wooden chair, "and keep her hands to your sides."

As Amber took her seat, three more women filed into the room from another doorway, with the handlers, Shane and Tony following close behind. All of the women were completely nude and collared. 

The first one in line was Asian. At about 5'2'', she was the shortest of the three, petite, with a round face and shoulder length, jet-black hair. The next girl had the slim, tight body of a dancer, pearl white skin, large dark oval eyes, and light brown wavy locks. Amber assumed the third to be Livia when she saw the unusual pointed tribal tattoo on her lower abdomen. Gone was the leather mask, but her wrists and ankles still showed the rope marks from being tied to the table. Her eyes looked glassy and tired. She had obviously been through quite an ordeal with Sonia.

Shane ordered the girls to 'kneel' and they immediately did so in exactly the same manner -- knees apart, back posture perfect, eyes down, palms to the floor, butt resting on the heels. Livia, being as weak as she was, merely sank to the floor and tried her best to remain alert. After Monique finished oiling the last paddle, she quickly scurried to the floor and took her position with the others.

Raven was the last to enter the room and his presence immediately drew everyone's attention. His long, dark hair was still pulled neatly back into a ponytail, but he was shirtless now. 

"On your feet," he said to the woman in the white slip, who quickly stood up. Her eyes never left the floor.

"Shii Ann, come here," he ordered, "Marin, you too."

The Asian and the brunette rose to their feet and stepped forward.

"Chain her."

Both slaves took a chain and shackled the woman's wrists. Next they were instructed to shackle her ankles to a pair of steel rings spaced about four feet from each other in the floor. Raven tested the links, then tightened each by turning a wheel crank in the wall. Slowly, her arms were pulled wide above her head until she was almost on her toes in a wide spread-eagle stance. The slip she wore looked thin and airy, almost glowing with the torch lit behind her, as though it were desperate to show off her naked form underneath as best it could. 

Amber felt her heart beating like a rabbit. The chair she sat on was of rough oak and there were several places where would-be splinters poked at her bare flesh. The stone floor was as cold as ice under her bare feet. 

"Jerri, do you know why you are being punished?" Raven approached the chained girl.

"Yes, Sir."

"And you still refuse to accept Mr. Quinn as your new owner?"

"Yes, Sir."

"I gather you've forgotten the rather large sum this man bid for you at the auction?"

"N . . . no, Sir."

"Then why do you insist on putting me in this position?"

Jerri paused a moment as if she were unsure how to answer. 

"I want . . . I need to be with you, Sir," she finally said.

Raven touched her shoulder, slid his hand up to the back of her neck and stroked her cheek gently with his thumb. 

"So my fledgling is reluctant to leave the nest." 

Jerri didn't pull away. Didn't say anything. Just stood very still. Not stiff. Just still, relaxed, staring up into his eyes.

"You ARE my girl," he said, "aren't you?"

"Yes, Sir," she replied anxiously. "I am your girl."

Raven gave her cheek a light pat, then reached into his pocket and pulled out a small pen knife.

"Well then, let us have a look at you."

Jerri moaned as he cut away the flimsy garment and let it drop to her feet. A thin sheen of sweat already covered her body from head to toe. Her ribs were etched under the swells of her firm, round breasts; her eyes bright with anticipation, brimming with a mixture of dread and desire. She was like an animal, a sleek female animal, acting only on impulse and void of all rational thought. 

She moaned again as Raven ran his hand down to her left breast.

"So you want me to care for you. To tell you when to eat. When to sleep . . ." 

"Yes, Sir."

"To bind your body and use it in whatever fashion that pleases me . . ."

"Yessss," her eyes closed, "do with me what you wish!"

"Ahh, but it was my wish that you be sold to Mr. Quinn, was it not?"

The trap had been set. Jerri opened her eyes, but couldn't bring herself to look at him. She seemed confused now, unsure of herself.

Raven took his hand away from her breast and turned to the table, "Mr. Quinn and I have already found a solution to the problem that you have so selfishly brought upon us," he continued formally. "I will return his money, with the option of letting him purchase another slave at a set price once her training is complete. That means you belong to ME now, my pet."

Both men nodded in agreement, then Raven returned from the table with a long bullwhip curled in one hand. It was tightly braided, about six feet long. Amber remembered the whip Sonia had used on her earlier, but this one was far more menacing. Somehow, she knew Jerri's punishment was going to be much worse.

"You are a very beautiful girl, Jerri," he remarked. "Sonia was quite correct in her physical evaluation of you when she brought you here. You had all the assets we seek in a high-quality sexual slave. But now, you have disappointed me. I invested many, long hours in training you, only to find that you are just as rebellious as ever. You've learned nothing."

Amber gripped the edge of her chair. She could feel the wood prickling her clammy skin as she watched. Raven circled about the girl, teasing and taunting, not only his captive, but his audience as well. He looked incredible without his shirt -- his muscles like steel, defined and shaped not by hours in the gym like Shane's, but by life. Real life. Under his left breast was a scar, long and jagged. A second began at the left shoulder and snaked its way under his armpit. There was not an ounce of fat on the man, not even around his mid-section. But it was his eyes that got to Amber the most -- quick and savage, like a coiled cobra's behind a stone-face expression as he walked about the girl, touching her insolently, randomly, the chrome handled whip in his fist all the while. Intimately, he lorded his power over her in anticipation of using it on her. Raven was not whipping Jerri just to punish her, nor was it an attempt to intimidate the other slaves. He was doing it for his own enjoyment. The only question now was, how far would he go?

He put his hands on her breasts. His touches were light, but there was no mistaking the possessiveness behind them. Jerri drew a hot breath when he rubbed the chrome handle of his whip against her nipples, each in turn until they became erect, then drew a line down her taut belly. Jerri was whimpering her surrender by the time he reached her bare sex, freshly shaven and now vulnerable between her open thighs. 

Jerri swayed helplessly on the chains like a tree branch caught in the wind, her cries of pleasure mingling with her agony. It made Amber think of the dream she had; of the bats in the cave.

"Do not come," he commanded, even as he pressed the handle against Jerri's slick folds and teased her with it. 

He toyed with her for a time, then left her dangling, head thrashing, eyes rolled up to the ceiling, hips undulating, every captive inch of her craving the man's attentions, no matter how rough. 

"Please, Master," she cried piteously, the shaft-like handle having been removed from between her legs. "Don't stop." 

"Beg for it, slave." 

Jerri shuddered. "I beg you, Master," she said through clenched teeth. "Violate me once again with your whip." 

Raven denied her, administering instead a thick snap to her calf, inducing a wail of pain. "Do you dare put your pleasure above mine?" 

"No, Sir. I seek only your pleasure," she corrected herself. "I beg you, Master, whip my body if it pleases you." 

"Oh I will, slave," he promised darkly. "I will." 

Amber bit her lip. It was going to happen and she couldn't bear to watch, and yet, if she turned away, Raven might be disappointed, angry even. 

"Amber," said Raven as he slid the tip of the whip across Jerri's tear sodden cheek to her open lips. "I want you to count for me. We'll go to TEN." 

Jerri kissed the whip eagerly, then took it inside her mouth, the top of her tongue running up and down the shiny chrome handle of the very device that was about to scourge her naked, helpless body. 

"Please," Amber begged. She gripped her fingers tightly around the chair seat, fighting as best she could the strange urge to run her hands between her own legs. "Don't make me do this."

"Would you like to take Jerri's place?"

"No . . . I mean . . . I just can't do it," she began to stammer.

"Very well," Raven informed her. "Count or don't count, but I will not stop until I hear the full complement from your lips." He pulled back his arm, the whip snapped, then sailed through the air toward Jerri, striking her just below the navel. 

SWISHHHHHH . . . CRAAAACCKK!

The sound shattered Amber's nerves. He was blackmailing her now, by using the girl's torture as a means of winning her collaboration. Without waiting for a reaction, Raven swung the whip again and took a slice across Jerri's outer thigh.

"One!" Amber squeezed her eyes shut and counted. 

Jerri jerked and moaned as the next slash landed across her breasts. An angry welt immediately began to rise from one globe to another, traversing a line between her nipples. 

"Two!" 

He swung the whip even harder and seared her breasts again.

"Three! Please, no more!" Amber begged. 

Raven ignored the plea, and the next blow landed on the girl's inner thigh, just missing her sex an inch. Jerri screamed. 

Hungrily, Amber watched, dreading and craving what was to follow. Number five broke the skin across Jerri's left hip, number six on the right. Each stroke was like a crack of doom against her naked flesh. Her seemingly flawless body was now streaked with angry red welts. Her screams dissolved into low moans, her eyes rolled to the ceiling. She was somewhere else now, far away. 

Amber moaned again and counted as the final blows were administered to Jerri's stomach, again across her breasts, and even her arms. The total count had reached eleven when Raven finally stopped, one more count due to Amber's slow reaction to his instructions. 

But it was far from over.

He circled around close behind Jerri and roughly fondled her breasts. She whimpered as his hands raked over them cruelly. Then he ran his fingers down to her bare sex and parted her lips. One finger worked on Jerri's clit, causing her to wiggle her butt against his hard cock, now straining against the tight, leather pants he wore.

Amber thought he was going to violate the girl right there in front of everyone, but just then, Raven released her and stood back with the whip still in his hand. 

"Another count, Amber. TEN please."

Amber counted as he whipped her from behind. He struck her shoulder blades, her lower back, and once, a side arm stroke that snaked around Jerri's ribs and snapped the tip of her left nipple. After ten counts, Raven tossed the whip on the table and then grabbed a long, oar-shaped leather paddle. One side of the instrument was pebbled with small metal studs. 

"Ten more counts, Amber," he ordered, "and louder so we can all hear you."

So Amber watched helplessly and counted as he swung the paddle against Jerri's naked buttocks, first one fleshy cheek, then the other. 

WHOP . . . WHOP . . . WHOP!

Jerri tossed her head back and yelped. Each time the paddle make contact, her hips lurched forward as though she were performing a sex act for the audience. 

Amber tightened her grip on the chair seat while she watched. Unbidden, she parted her knees and began grinding her own bare cheeks against the rough wood. She wanted desperately to free her hands from the chair and satisfy the need building deep inside her undulating sex, but dared not to. As tortured as it was, she knew Raven would be angry with her if she masturbated without his permission. Then she would be the one bearing the punishment instead of Jerri.

Raven used the flogger next. Once again, Amber was forced to count, ten times, as he snapped the long rubber tresses across Jerri's back. He then moved around to the front of his captive and struck her breasts. Her nipples popped erect under the harsh beating, then turned a vivid red. Her vocals dampened to a soft whimper. The last few strokes were saved for Jerri's loins. Her abdominal muscles strained as she tried to bring her legs together to protect herself, but the bindings around her ankles held firm. Even then, Raven showed no mercy, and struck her bare sex again and again until the count was completed. And then it was done.

Jerri hung still with her head hanging limply backward past her shoulders, her neck exposed. Beads of sweat ran freely down her red-streaked body. Amber's chest was heaving almost as fast as that of her punished soul sister. She wanted to masturbate badly. There was no question of force now, no issue of kidnap. No doubt in her mind now that she was like the others -- turned on by pain and humiliation, aroused by the very thought of her subjugation as a female slave at the hands of her master.

The room was silent again. All eyes followed Raven as he took Amber's arm and lifted her from the chair. 

"You are quite thoroughly intoxicated," he told her, "my little college girl."

Her face flushed with the realization that he knew exactly what she was feeling, that he understood her so well. 

"Take this one back to her quarters," he handed Amber over to the handlers, "and Mr. Quinn, please let me offer you the service of one of these slaves kneeling before you. We'll also furnish a room, so you may enjoy her company in privacy. No charge."

"Very well," Quinn studied the four women, "I'll have the tall blond on the far end."

"A fine choice," Raven remarked. "Sonia, prepare Livia for our guest."

This time it was Tony who escorted Amber back to her cell. Like Shane, he was well-muscled, only dark, almost Italian-looking, with short black hair. Without a word, he led her down the hall, and once again, she was strapped naked to her bed. There in the dark, she was left alone an hour, or maybe two hours -- she couldn't be sure, but it seemed forever to her.

Then at last, the door opened and Monique entered the room, followed by Shii Ann. They were both wearing a sheer clingy form of silk about their bodies that wrapped like a pareau with a disrobing loop at the left shoulder. 

"Come with us," Monique whispered as they released her bindings, "Master Raven requests your presence -- in private."

Leather cuffs were fastened to her wrists behind her back, then Amber was led by a leash up to a room on the second floor. Two walls were lined with closets, and another wall, covered from the floor to the ceiling with a large mirror. A door lead to a small washroom that contained a sink and a chair that tilted back into it, like one might see in a salon.

They washed and dried Amber's hair, then sat her in a chair in front of the mirror where she was properly made up. Mascara was applied, and bright red lipstick, even her nails were manicured. All the while, Amber could see herself, seated naked in the chair each time her gaze strayed to the mirror. Both women said nothing as they worked, until Amber finally broke the silence and inquired about Jerri.

"She recovers," Monique answered in a low voice, without offering any further explanation.

Amber knew it was forbidden for slaves to talk among themselves, or even to anyone else, unless properly addressed. Her eyes darted around the room through the reflection in the mirror, searching for any cameras, but there were none that she could see. It didn't mean they were necessarily alone though, or whether someone could be watching them through a peephole camouflaged in the wall.

They applied in generous amounts of perfume to her neck, her breasts, under her arms and between her thighs. The outfit chosen for her was a long silk robe with gold high heels for her feet and nothing else. The robe had a gold chain button tie just above the breasts to keep it closed loosely around her body. Very loosely. After a final inspection, Amber's wrists were fastened again behind her back with silver bracelets. 

The panic returned, swimming through her gut like an eel. She thought of asking the others what lay ahead, but even if they knew, she was sure they would not tell her, not after witnessing Jerri's brutal punishment. For the first time, Amber realized how powerful Raven was. Everyone seemed to fear him, even Sonia and the handlers. She saw the looks on their faces as he carried out Jerri's sentence, striking her helpless, nude body full force with the whip, again and again without hesitation, without mercy. Now Amber was going to face him alone. 

Monique opened the door and led her out of the room, with Shii Ann following close behind. Together, the three of them moved quickly and silently down the hall.

Indoctrintation
by Night Owl


Chapter 8: Rope Play

The first twenty hours of captivity at Dark Oak Manor were worse than anything Amber Brkich could believe possible. She had been kept isolated from the outside world and allowed very little sleep so there was no way to mark the passage of time. She had been tied up, whipped, paraded naked in front of strangers, forced to witness another slave's brutal punishment, and everything happened so fast, her mind could not deal with it rationally. She felt confused, unsure of herself, unable to maintain her normal thought processes. Now Amber was being taken to meet Raven, the man behind the horrible nightmare, and already, she was fearing the worst.

Monique and Shii Ann guided her down the winding staircase, through the heavy wooden door, and across a flagstone courtyard. For the first time in what seemed like ages, Amber was allowed to venture outside of the house. It was late afternoon. The three-day storm that hit the whole northeast had finally passed, though the dark sky still threatened more rain. Her long silk robe remained closed about the breasts in front, but it did little to conceal the rest of her nude body as it fanned outward in the cool, moist air, and since her hands were locked behind her back, there was no way of keeping it closed. They passed a long stable house, large enough to hold a small army. When they approached the corner of the building, Monique stopped ahead of them, turned and pulled Amber's collar ring up, forcing her to arch her back forward.

"You must learn to hold your body thus to keep your breasts presented," Monique cautioned her, "especially when you are in the Master's presence, or you will be punished." Amber took heed the warning and kept her back straight as they rounded the corner. 

Raven was riding a beautiful black mare around a short oval track next to the stable house. He was an excellent rider. In his hand, he held a leather crop, though it appeared he had little need for it. A short kick to the flanks brought the animal to a full gallop as he passed the three women. Then he steered his mount into a tight turn and started a gentle pace back. Amber felt her heart beating heavy against her chest as they made their way across the field to meet him. There was no denying her attraction to Raven. He was dangerously handsome, but underneath that dashing, old-world exterior lurked something dark and malicious waiting to be unleashed. She was strangely drawn to that part of him as well, and at the same time, it frightened her terribly. He dismounted in front of the stable, and tethered the mare to a hitching post. Moments later, a stable hand took the horse back to its stall. 

"Leave us," Raven motioned the other two girls as he approached, "and fetch me a drink. Make it the usual."

"Yes Sir," Monique answered, and without another word, the other two women headed back to the house. He and Amber were now alone.

"Very becoming," he said as he moved in closer, then parted the robe with his hands and gazed at her naked form underneath.

Amber moved her arms slightly. The silver bands shifted loosely on her wrists. She could feel his wolfish eyes roaming up and down her body, and despite their slackness, the bracelets remained locked. Her wrists, her hands were hopelessly lost to her, leaving her powerless to protect herself. She looked at Raven, searching his face for any hope of . . ."

"Did I say you could look at me?"

"No Sir," she quickly lowered her eyes to the ground.

He unclipped the chain from her collar and draped it over the fence. "I detest these," he frowned. "A true submissive should never have to be led around like a dog on a leash. Not if she knows her place, and who she belongs to. Don't you agree?" 

There was a moment of silence between them. Amber knew the question was a trap and carefully worded to see if she would answer him incorrectly. She knew what would happen if she said 'no', and then again, if she agreed, it would imply that she had some choice in the matter -- which she didn't. Her time with her captors had been brief so far, but already Amber was beginning to understand what her role was, and how to at least act submissive.

"It isn't my place to say, Sir."

Raven nodded his head, apparently satisfied with the answer. "Come with me then, and see what I have planned for you."

He turned and led Amber back toward the house, leaving the leash dangling off the fence.

------------------

Sonia watched the two of them from a window on the second floor, and didn't like what she saw. Of course, it was always expected that the master of the house might take a slave aside to himself for an evening or two, and even the handlers were allowed a taste every now and then, but never this early in the training process, when a fledgling hadn't yet acquired the coping skills to deal with the unfamiliar and the very intense feelings she may be experiencing.

It happened to Jerri, and with disastrous results. Sonia could see her grow more and more attached to Raven during their 'sessions'. Whether it was intentional or not, she couldn't say for sure, but by the time Raven was finished with her, the damage had already been done. Now he was trying to cover up his own mistake by shipping the girl down to some 'dick farm' in Venezuela. If she was lucky, her new owner might keep her for himself and assign her as a house servant. Otherwise, she would be forced to work long, grueling hours in the hot sun, that is, when the field hands weren't fucking her. What a waste! And now it was about happen all over again.

For the first time, Sonia began to question Raven's competence in running his own business. There were investors, silent partners who would want to know what happened to Jerri, and why she was sent away without attempting to fix the problem by putting her through more training. 

But as Sonia glared at the two figures below, she knew there was something else that bothered her -- something more personal. For the first time in her adult life, she was jealous. The feeling had become almost alien to her over the years, but it was unmistakable -- a mix of hatred and desire that seethed inside her, like a hot bed of coals being fanned to life, and she was finding it very difficult to control.

------------------

Amber followed Raven through a garden behind the house to a round covered patio that resembled a gazebo. The roof was held up by five large posts with picketed fence rails around the sides. Sitting on a table were coils of rope and two silk scarves. She didn't have to guess what was going to happen next, and the thought of being tied up out in the open like this made her flesh tingle. Raven tossed the riding crop on the table deliberately so she would see it.

"Turn around," he ordered.

As Amber did so, he pulled a key out of his pocket and removed the bracelets from her wrists.

"Now face me, and remove that robe."

Amber raised her hands up to undo the button tie about her breasts. The robe opened, then slid easily off her shoulders.

"Very nice," Raven nodded. He put the bracelets back on her wrists so they were locked in front of her. "There is a post directly behind you. I want you to step back to it."

She felt her feet move backward, seemingly on their own, as if her mind had somehow become disconnected with the rest of her body.

"All the way back against the post," he took one of the scarves and wadded it up into a ball.

Amber hesitantly obeyed. She did not know what he had in mind, and did not really care to find out. But, with Raven she knew that she had no choice in the matter. She allowed him to push the cloth past her lips and tie the other scarf tightly over her mouth. He then raised her arms overhead and attached the bracelets to a hook high up on the post. In the coming days, Amber would find more hooks of different sizes placed strategically about the grounds and in the house itself -- all used for the same purpose. 

"Spread your legs . . . wider. That's it. Now stand still."

She remained motionless with her legs apart, her feet pointed uncomfortably in their four inch heels, while Raven took different lengths of rope and proceeded to bind her to the post. Bands of rope were tied around her chest, above and below her breasts, then pulled tightly to the post. He wrapped another length of rope around her lower abdomen several times, just below the navel. Her ankles were tied to the fence rail, then her upper thighs, to keep her legs secured. When he was done, Amber was quite helpless, trapped in a wide stance with her arms stretched high above her head and yards of rope coiled tightly around her body. Raven took the last piece of rope and cinched one end of it to the center her breast ropes. He passed the other end between her legs, then up behind her to the hook above.

"Ummmmmpppphhhhhhmmmm," she groaned into the gag as he pulled once, then twice, and finally a third time before tying it off. The result was a sensation Amber had never experienced before. With all of her pubic hair gone, she could feel every course fiber pushing hard against her smooth crotch.

As Raven was tightening the last knot, Monique appeared again holding a tray with a glass of what appeared to be cognac.

"Your drink, Sir." 

After Raven took the glass, she slipped away quietly without even a glance in Amber's direction.

"How do the ropes feel?" Raven pulled up a chair at the table.

"Mmmmmmmmph!" A muffled cry was the only response Amber could give him. Gazing downward, she saw her breasts bulging almost obscenely through the bands of rope, and her nipples stood proudly erect, as though eager to accept the abuse that would most surely be inflicted on them.

"That's raw hemp," he said, "a material traditionally used in Japanese rope bondage, and for good reason. Its natural properties are coarse in texture, yet pliable. And it holds a knot remarkably well. See if you can get loose . . ."

Without thinking, she pulled hard against the ropes and immediately felt the strong, woody fibers rubbing against her body.

"Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmph!" 

Careful, my pet," he laughed, "untreated hemp is highly abrasive. Any sudden movement against the skin produces a burning effect that can be painful, and even damaging for those who are not used to it. Considering the military origins of Japanese restraint, where the goal was to immobilize a prisoner, rough fibers like these were a good choice. Don't you think?"

"Mmmmmmmmph! Mmmmmmmmmm!" 

Raven stood up from the table and started to massage her exposed, bound breasts. Her nipples, now engorged, turned a deep red.

"You must relax," he said. "Move slowly with ropes and you'll enjoy it."

"Mmmmmmmmmmmm . . ."

"Rope is one of the oldest, most tried, most trusted of materials used in the application of bondage, and by far, my personal favorite. It is a form of sensual torture all to itself -- the way it rubs into the skin, the visual pleasure of its craftsmanship. Even the pleasant, grassy aroma can arouse the senses." 

Amber closed her eyes and breathed heavily into the gag. It was not an all-together unpleasant feeling, she was ashamed to admit to herself. She felt her body sway as he gently kneaded her breasts. The chafing grew less intense with her subtle movements, then quickly melted into a delicious mixture of pain and pleasure. 

"Yes. That's it, just relax. I'm not going to hurt you. At least, not now," he smiled with a wicked grin. 

"Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm," she pushed her breasts forward into Raven's hands.

"A woman is the most important creature to her male counterpart," he said. "When God created Eve, he took her from the rib of a man. She was taken from his side, to be his compliment, his partner. Yet at the same time, a woman is the weaker sex, making her a missionary, especially in the art of lovemaking. That is why, Amber, so many woman like being bound during their sexual encounters. They want to be gagged, controlled, forced against their will. It is that same feeling of helplessness that is turning you on, is it not?" 

"Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmm," came the muffled replies. 

His hands left her chest and moved to her abdomen. "Hmmmm, you're very tight and firm here. I like a young lady who takes care of her body, and these ropes compliment your shape beautifully." His fingers traveled down to Amber's shaved mound.

"Mmmmmmm, mmmmmmm, mmmmmm, mmmmm," she moaned, feeling more anxious. 

"Are you becoming aroused? Or are you just being apprehensive about where I am touching you? Personally, I think you're becoming more aroused." 

His fingers brushed her labia, but they would not enter. Amber tried to push down on his hand. 

"I know you want me to touch you there, but you're not ready yet. You must be more focused on why you are here," he started to trace her belly again. 

"Now I want you to undulate for me," he said. "You do this by bringing your hips forward and back, then your stomach and breasts. Do this in a smooth wave-like motion. Let the ropes move across your body, but do it slowly. Otherwise, you will not fully enjoy the experience."

Amber began moving her body the way Raven described, and just as he predicted, she felt the ropes shift and rub around her breasts, against her abdomen, and most noticeably between her thighs.

"Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm." 

"Yes, very nice. Does it feel good?" 

"Mmmmmmm, mmmmm," she slowly pulled her abdominal muscles in once more, then pushed her breasts forward. "Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm." 

"That's it. Slowly. So I can feel those tight, toned muscles in my hands. Let the ropes control you. Let them remind you that you cannot escape their hold." 

He took her breasts into his hands again, then started to squeeze and massage them, twirling her rock hard nipples gently between his thumbs and index fingers.

"Oooooommmmmmmmmmm," Amber moaned louder into her gag and tried desperately to get away from the hands that were causing her so much agonizing pleasure, twisting about within the ropes that held her so expertly. He knew just how to touch a woman, to get her juices flowing. Amber had seen him demonstrate this before, and she was certainly no exception. She moaned again in silent shame and humiliating pleasure.

"Yes, that's a girl. You are doing quite well. Now move your hips from side to side."

She did so, and felt the ropes tighten against the smooth muscles where her inner thighs joined her hips. The crotch rope, which had become well-lubricated, continued to work its way deeper and deeper inside her. Unable to remain still, she squirmed in her bonds, tried to bring her legs together, but the struggling only increased the pressure. A strange electricity began to flash through her body from the raw hemp rubbing against her tender folds and clit.

"Hmmmmmm, mmmmm, mmmmmmm," Amber was now begging for a release. 

"Poor wretch," he said. "Those pesky ropes are giving your body quite the workout, aren't they? Perhaps if there was something else to distract you."

Raven turned to the table and reached for the riding crop -- the same one he carried as he rode the black mare around the track. Later, Amber would recall never seeing him strike the animal with it. Not once. But he certainly had no reservations about using the crop on her. 

Swishhhh . . . WHOP! 

"MMMMMMMMMMMMMMPH!" She screamed as the first blow landed just below her left nipple. 

Swishhhh . . . WHOP! 

Amber moaned again and jerked painfully against the ropes. Sweat broke out all over her body.

Swishhhh . . . WHOP! Swishhhhhhhh . . . WHOP . . .!

He struck her breasts six more times with the crop. Yet despite the searing pain it caused, she felt terribly aroused by it, so much, that she couldn't hide her disappointment when he finally lay the instrument down on the table.

"Pain has many uses," he said. "It can be used as punishment or for pleasure, depending on how it is applied, but for a slave, one cannot exist without the other." 

He moved in closer and massaged her breasts again. 

"To the untrained mind, this may seem contradictory on the surface. If an outsider were to see you now, he might think, 'That poor girl! She is totally helpless! She is in pain!' But you and I know different, don't we? Even now, your emotions are running wild. Your desires, your sexuality, all of your repressions have been set free, haven't they?" 

"Mmmmmm, mmmmmmmmm," she nodded. 

"It is all about letting go, Amber. Surrendering control. As the ropes tighten around your body, when the lash strikes your flesh, the bonds inside loosen. Knowing that you have NO CHOICE, allows you to quiet your mind and focus on the inner experience." 

"Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm . . ." 

"Women crave submission, respond positively to the male dominant, for it is in their nature to be so; an essential quality that has always existed within the weaker sex. Even in the midst of the so-called 'modern feminine ideal,' this primitive state of existence remains; hidden; untouched by civilization and its artificiality." 

His hands moved up her arms, then down the sides of her body. 

"When a woman discovers these submissive needs for the first time, she will endure a period of self-doubt. She may think something is wrong with her. A sickness, a mental disorder. That is what the society we live in wants us believe, Amber. Western culture places the highest value on independence, on that 'pull yourself up by the bootstraps' attitude, the less needy and more self-sufficient. It values competition over cooperation, material achievement over achievement in relationship. It forces us to be someone we are not, to conform to its temperance until we have become totally disconnected with who we really are. But there is something very wrong with believing that such independence is the only good. It is especially wrong for the most relatedness-oriented among us -- the submissive female. Together, you and I will tap into your inner feelings, your darkest desires through pain and restraint. You will learn to separate out the voices of our culture -- the voices telling you that you are too needy, too dependent, too focused on the others in your life. Once you have articulated the language of your true nature, then you will begin to question, not YOURSELF, but the validity of those cultural values. You will learn to measure your life based on who YOU are, and not by society's standard."

Raven's voice was smooth and penetrating, and the more Amber listened, the more his words seemed to fill her head and take root. She became confused, disoriented, at odds with herself, and all the while, she was aware of his hands roaming all over her body, caressing her flesh with a grip that felt both strong and reassuring.

"When your indoctrination is complete, it will affect all aspects of your life. Not just the bedroom. Role-playing is merely a pretense, a lifeless cardboard cut-out imitation. True submission comes from the heart and soul, with no hint of artificiality, acting, or mendacity. A woman who has found herself, will feel the need to be controlled; constrained by an unstoppable force; restrained; bound; reined in; no choice; no decisions; all freedom must be relinquished to His authority, His lordship; not because of incompetence, emotional liability or any lack of desire to take responsibility for her own actions, and not because she needs a man to make decisions for her, but simply because that is the way it must be." 

He trailed his fingers down her abdomen to the rope in her crotch and pulled it slowly.

"Now I want you to come for me, my pet. Give me that orgasm you've been so anxiously waiting for. You are bound and gagged, with no escape. Feel your body and vagina contract as one," he drove the rope up harder, making her tremble. "Yes . . . that's it. Very nice." 

"Mmmmmmm, mmmmmm, mmmmmmm, mmmmmmm!" The climax shook Amber's body. Her muscles tensed. She squeezed her eyelids shut and her breasts bounced with the trembling sensation. The ropes chafed and burned her flesh as she struggled violently with her orgasm, though she barely noticed. Finally, she fell limply against the post. Raven withdrew his hand. 

"Did you enjoy that, my pet?"

"Mmmmmm," Amber nodded and moaned softly. When she opened her eyes again, Monique was standing silently nearby with leash in hand.

"Now that your lesson is over, I must leave you and tend to other business," he then turned to Monique. "Take this one to her quarters and see that she is fed. All that struggling depleted her recourses some, and I want her strength built back up for her next session." 

Once untied, Amber's hands were immediately locked in the bracelets behind her back. The sun was already setting as they made their way back to the house. The air grew cool and a light drizzle had begun to fall. Goose bumps pimpled her arms, legs and breasts, but even the weather could not cool the frissons of passion that were still streaming through her whole body. Since her capture, Amber had always been restrained in some way or other, and now she knew why. It wasn't just to keep her from escaping, but a reminder that her own body belonged to someone else now. That she was no longer permitted to even touch it. 

That night in her cell, Amber couldn't sleep. Her arms and legs were tied to the corners of the cot in the usual spread-eagle fashion. Hours had passed, and even though the burn marks had all but faded, she could still feel the course ropes against her flesh just as vividly as if they were still there. The fact was, she wanted to be fucked in the worst way. That wonderful orgasm brought on from the ropes didn't seem to be enough. She needed to feel a man inside her, to make her complete again. She needed Raven.

Another hour passed, and by then, she was finding it very difficult to even keep still. She began to twist and writhe on the bed. She imagined the crotch rope rubbing deep inside her, inflaming her pussy. The thought, alone, sent shivers through her body, but then she stopped suddenly when she saw the camera perched high on the wall. Her cheeks flushed with shame as she stared at the black eye looking down at her, its red light glowing in the darkness, recording every move she made. Her thoughts turned to Rob, her boyfriend. It seemed so long ago now -- a lifetime. She tried to envision his face in her mind, to replay the sound of his voice, but everything seemed blurred and detached. 

"What's happening to me," she thought.

Amber stared at the ceiling in silence, her mind lost in a daze. Only the sound of a key turning in the lock to her cell brought her back to reality. The door opened.

It was Shane.

"Alone at last," he said, and closed the door behind him.

Chapter 9: A Fool&#8217;s Pact

Shane quickly pulled off his t-shirt, enjoying the way her eyes traveled down his body. He was well-muscled due to many long hours of working out in the gym. His sandy blonde hair stood out even in the darkness of her cell. When he pulled off his jeans, Amber could already see his growing erection bulging obscenely through the tight confines of his briefs.

"Is this what you've been waiting for?" The smile he gave her was predatory and dangerous. Amber shuddered. 

Shane's mouth descended on her neck, his tongue peeking out to taste her here and there. Amber tried to twist and turn to get away, but his bulk was too much for her slight frame.

"Please," she whispered, "you shouldn't do this. Raven will . . ."

"Raven isn't here," he broke in, "and you're in no position to tell me what to do." He then followed his answer with a heavy kiss on her mouth.

It was true, she was completely helpless. She was bound spread-eagled on the bed. She was also becoming unbearably aroused by his touches, no doubt, brought on by the long, teasing session she had with Raven only hours before. But it was Raven she wanted, not this man, whom she grew to detest the most since her abduction.

"Now do as I say, and this will be over before you know it." 

Unable to speak, she only nodded. Then he was upon her. When their groins touched, Amber could feel his hardness under the thin, cotton wall of his briefs, and echoed it with her own moist reaction. He slathered wet, open-mouthed kisses down her neck and around her breasts. The open air cooled her damp skin. Her nipples grew taut and erect. She felt betrayed by her own body, as it reveled in the delicious sensations that her mind still refused to accept. When his mouth found one nipple, he lapped at the sensitive flesh with his tongue. Unable to control herself, Amber moaned out loud as he bit down, then drew the tip of his tongue over the captured nub. She pulled against her restraints, but the bindings held firm in keeping her useless limbs splayed outward. 

"Please . . ." she choked.

He released her quivering nipple and slowly covered her open armpits in wet, ticklish kisses. The feeling was unbearable and goose bumps broke out all over her smooth, almond skin. A silent, unseen battle raged on inside between her mind and her body, the former trying to regain control over the later. When Shane tried to kiss her again, she turned her head away in denial.

"Hmmm, hard to get," he grinned. "I like that."

Holding her chin steady, he pressed his lips hard against hers, and explored her mouth with intensity. His left hand ambled downward between her legs. Fingers the size and feel of railroad spikes started to probe the moist darkness there. The heat began to intensify between their bodies. She could smell him. The musky scent of his sweat blended with the damp, mossy smell of the room. She could feel his hot breath on her neck, her breasts smashing flat against his heavy chest. Amber reeled at the sensations. Her mind was losing the battle; held virtual hostage by the physical cravings of her own body, which now seemed to have a will of its own. Whatever fears Amber had of Raven melted away, as well as her dislike for the man lying on top of her. 

"I've wanted you since that first day you walked in," Shane whispered. "So don't think I'm going to be gentle with you just because it's our first time."

He buried his face in her neck. Amber could feel the heat peeling off of him, mingling with her own body heat, making them sweat even more. All she could smell was sweat -- his and hers, intensifying, dizzying. Shane's hands wandered from her breasts to her thighs and back again, seemingly unable to stay still. Suddenly, he swept his briefs off, then plunged into her without warning. Amber drew a breath, her stomach dropped. 

As the urgent need for release intensified within her, her defiant body rebelled against her will, quivering with desire and in anticipation of the delicious release which would follow. She moaned again and writhed beneath him. Her head lolled back as she gave in to the sensations. Shane picked up the tempo, his blood pumping furiously, his heart pounding. The impact of each thrust jarred her body like a rag doll. Amber was tittering on the brink. She clenched her teeth as another warm wave of pleasure spread from her loins, moving swiftly to engulf her. For what seemed like an eternity she hovered on the edge. With a final thrust, Shane buried his phallus deeply in her, she expected him to withdraw but he stayed embedded within her, finally tipping her over the edge. Amber cried out in frustration as the intense orgasm gripped her, racking her helpless body in spasms. Her walls convulsed around Shane's immense shaft, gripping it tightly until it throbbed and flooded her with semen.

After several long minutes, Shane removed his flaccid penis and got dressed. As her mind and body returned back to earth, Amber realized that she had just experienced (or suffered) the most intense orgasm in months, and felt mortified by how it occurred. Then Shane spoke up, giving Amber no chance for thought or reflection.

"It's time you and I understood each other," he said. "I can make your stay here a hell of a lot more easier . . . perhaps even arrange for your escape if the time is right." 

For the first time, Amber had hope that she would get out of this place. She only nodded and listened carefully.

"I'll be coming back for a taste every now and then," he continued, "and all you have to, is keep your mouth shut. Not that I really care if you tell anyone. I'll just deny it. Then it'll be your word against mine. And who do you think they'll believe?"

"You," she answered obediently.

"That's right. And I'd hate to see Raven mark up that pretty little body of yours. So we'll just make this our little secret. Understood?"

Amber nodded.

"Smart girl." 

"You said you could get me out of here?"

"We'll see," he zipped his pants. "It isn't easy getting someone out. It's not impossible either. That might sound like I'm bullshitting you, but the fact is, I'm the only chance you've got. So keep that in mind."

Amber nodded again as he loosened her bindings. She wouldn't have thought it possible that she could be even more repulsed by this man -- not just in the way he used her, but in how he treated her now. Shane considered her nothing more than a vessel, a means to his own end. He was not like Raven at all. Amber also knew he wasn't being truthful about letting her go, and that his visits to her room would most-likely bring nothing in return. But he was right about one thing. She had no choice in the matter. 

"Now go clean yourself up." 

Shane sat back on the cot and watched her as she went to the toilet. Amber wondered what would happen if Raven found out. Would they both be punished? She thought of saying something to Raven, but then quickly pushed the idea aside, fearing that it would only make her situation worse. When she was done at the sink, she moved silently back to the bed, glancing nervously at the camera above.

"I wouldn't worry about that," he grinned. "I'll just switch the tape with an older one. They'll never know the difference. Now come lie down, so I can strap you in."

Shane bent forward and planted a hard kiss on her forehead as he tightened the last restraint around her wrist. 

"Remember," he said, "not a peep out of you." 

Then he left.

Indoctrintation
by Night Owl


Chapter 10: Lessons - Part Two

The following morning, Sonia came to Amber's quarters, and without a word, took her to one of the many small rooms that honeycombed the vast cellar. Waiting for them was a heavy, oak table with leather straps mounted on each corner. 

"Lie down on the table," she ordered, "face down."

Amber allowed her wrists and ankles to be buckled in the straps until her body was stretched very tightly across the cold, hard surface. Seeing the leather strap hanging from a hook nearby, Amber knew what she was in for, but she was not prepared for what happened next.

Sonia reached under the table and turned a wheel crank. Gears clicked as the wheel turned, and the end of the table at Amber's feet slowly began to rise, lifting her with it. The straps kept her body stationary while the table continued its angle upward until it was almost upright at 75 degrees, with Amber now lying almost completely upside down.

Suddenly, and without warning, the air was split with a 'swish', followed by a searing blow across her buttocks. Then there was another, and another. Amber tried to remain still and not cry out, but Sonia was persistent in getting the reaction she wanted. She flailed on Amber's bare tush with a dozen strokes from the strap, then after pausing briefly, she laid on a dozen more. Soon, Amber was whimpering, her body twisting and squirming as much as the restraints allowed. Her flesh burned terribly; her head felt like it was going to explode as the blood rushed down from the rest of her body. She had hoped Sonia would be satisfied with the result by then, but her mistress seemed to be in a particularly foul mood that morning, and so the beating went on. Six more heavy strokes landed around and between her buttocks, and six to the backs of her upper thighs before the strap was finally hung back on the wall. Gasping for air now, Amber then felt Sonia's hands caress each burning cheek. Her soothing touch actually took away some of the sting. She then moaned as fingers probed deep into the furrow between them to massage her wet slit. 

"My, you're quite the little bondage slut," she commented. "You're actually beginning enjoy all the abuse, aren't you?" 

Amber didn't answer.

"Well you better get used to it. During the course of your training, we will begin each day with a whipping. On occasion, you will also be asked if you want more, and when that happens, what will your answer be?"

"'Yes', Mistress," she mumbled.

"That's good, but try to put a little more heart into it, dear. The proper response is, 'yes, Sir or Mistress, I would like you to whip me if it pleases you,' or words to that effect. It always sounds better when a slave asks for her punishment. Understand what I'm saying?"

"Yes Mistress, I understand."

"Good. Now let's get you cleaned up."

Sonia unbuckled the straps, then guided her to the showers where Shii Ann stood waiting with a towel and razor. One again, Amber had to stand in the stall with her arms shackled high above her head. The water was turned on and it immediately cooled the burning flesh suffered from the strap. She felt a soft brush as it started at her bound wrists and moved down her body, softly scrubbing every inch. No human touch was ever evident -- only the soft bristles working the soap into her body. The person controlling the brush did not even hesitate at either her breasts or her sex, instead, she was simply cleaned, quickly and without any deviation from the task. After she was rinsed thoroughly, her underarms and legs were shaved with the razor.

Amber would learn later that all slaves early in their training had their arms and legs shaved every morning, and their pubic area twice a week to keep them smooth. There were several reasons for the procedure. One was to maintain proper hygiene, especially if the slave had genital piercings. Second, the look was considered an aesthetically pleasing one, even on some of the men. But most importantly, having the privates shaved enforced a sense of vulnerability on the slave, and every day, served as a reminder of his or her total submission. In the later stages of training, some girls were allowed to grow their pubic hair back, and keep it trimmed closely, for those 'guests' that had a preference for it. 

After the shower, Amber's body was quickly toweled off, then she was taken to her cell. For breakfast, they gave her a bowl of bland-tasting porridge that consisted of cold water and a grain they called Sa-Tarna, served with bread. Later that morning, house duties were assigned, and Amber had the unfortunate job of cleaning every bathroom in the house. Of course, she had to work in the nude, wearing only her leather collar which always stayed on, day or night.

The shower stalls in the dungeon were the most challenging to clean, since the tiles were so old and packed with grime and mildew. It seemed like they hadn&#8217;t been cleaned for ages. Worse yet, there were no windows for ventilation, so the fumes from the chemicals she was using lingered there in the shower stall with her, burning her nostrils, poisoning her lungs whenever she breathed them in. Twice she almost fainted from dizziness. The other bathrooms in the house were much easier to clean, only now, she had to be meticulous in her work, or else they would force her to do it all over again. 

During her chores, Len, one of the handlers, had been assigned to keep watch. He was a gaunt, unattractive man with shifty eyes and unkept hair. In the real world, no woman would have anything to do with him, which was why he probably cherished his job more than anyone else. Every day, he was surrounded by beautiful female slaves, and occasionally, allowed to take one for himself for an hour whenever Raven was in a charitable mood. 

He sat back in his chair and watched Amber intently as she got onto her hands and knees to scrub the floor tiles. She could almost feel his unblinking stares, and did her best to put the man out of her mind. In doing so, her thoughts turned to Shane and their encounter the night before. 

Was it a rape or had she been seduced? Amber mused. 

That was a question she found difficult to answer. The fact was, she still disliked Shane intensely, even more than the man staring at her from only a few feet away. But the act itself didn't seem to upset her at all. It felt strangely liberating to be under someone else's control, and whether it was Raven, or Sonia, or even Shane, made little difference. She remembered what Raven said the day before -- about pain and pleasure being one in the same, and loosening the bonds within one's self through the power of restraint. Amber knew, with a mild chagrin, that she was starting to understand what he meant. But was there really a submissive side to her, waiting to be discovered and released? Or was this all just a clever attempt to brainwash her into believing it? Regardless of which, Amber knew she was changing, and if even if she did find a way out of this place, her life would never be the same again.

After the last bathroom was cleaned, Sonia took charge again. She led Amber by her leash down the grand staircase to the first floor, then down a long dark hallway that seemed to branch off on its own from the rest of the house. The walls were only partially paneled here and the floor had just been carpeted.

"This is a new wing we are adding," Sonia told her. "As you can see, this whole area is still under construction, but when it's finished, we'll have six additional rooms on this level for our guests."

At the end of the hall, Sonia slid a built-in bookcase aside behind the wall panel to reveal a hidden door.

"This leads to the lower level," she continued, "each room down here will be designed with its own theme -- dungeons, interrogation rooms, all related to bondage and discipline, of course."

Amber stiffened in anticipation when she heard the key turning and the 'click!' of the deadlock as it disengaged. Down the narrow staircase they went to a dark corridor that ran parallel to the hallway above.

"As I've mentioned before, we have both male and female clients. Sometimes they are straight, sometimes gay, sometimes dominant, sometimes submissive, though we encourage only the dominant ones, since our girls are all trained to be submissive. We also categorize them as either "upstairs" or "downstairs" clients, depending on whether they want straight sex or something more elaborate, be it punishment, role-playing, or catering to some sort of fetish. These services allow potential buyers to 'sample' our girls, and at the same time, gives our advanced trainees some 'working' experience before they go to auction."

Sonia guided her into one of the rooms. Amber immediately noticed the mirrors that covered every wall from ceiling to floor, and even the ceiling itself. The pile on the new burgundy carpet was thick, and it felt rather coarse under her bare feet. She saw two pieces of furniture, a cabinet and table, but nothing else. On the table, were several pieces of rope, all coiled neatly and ready for use.

"Now, turn around and raise your arms high," Sonia ordered.

Amber did as she told and lifted her arms above her head. Instinctively, she then crossed her wrists so they could be tied together. As Sonia took a piece of medium-sized rope from the table, Amber was suddenly aware of how naked she was, her body freshly shaved in all the right places. She quivered with sheer excitement in knowing that, once again, yard after yard of course rope would be tightened against her flesh, until she was rendered completely immobile and helpless. Yes, she was going to make "a fantastic slave," Amber almost laughed to herself in recalling a comment Sonia had made during their first session. 

She stood like a statue, her arms raised high, as Sonia wrapped the first length of rope around her torso in neat coils starting just below her breasts, down to the bottom of her ribcage. She winced each time the coils were tightened and adjusted, pushing them snug up against her breasts. These ropes felt much rougher than the ropes Raven used on her the day before.

"It burns a little doesn't it?" Sonia commented. "No doubt you know what hemp feels like by now, but I left these ropes a warm oven for an hour to give them an extra bite." 

Sonia wrapped another length of rope in the same way around the upper curves of her breasts to her armpits, creating two coils of rope above and below her breasts. A smaller piece was looped around the bottom coils, then Sonia pulled the ends up between Amber's breasts, while twisting the two ends around each other two or three times before looping them around the upper coils. Finally, the remaining ends of the rope were run up over Amber's shoulders and tied off behind her back. This created a tight harness with the ropes squeezing into her breasts from top to bottom.

But Sonia wasn't finished yet. She grabbed two more shorter lengths of rope and looped one around the breast ropes under each armpit. She then pulled the loops as tight as she could, drawing the breast ropes together at the sides of Amber's body before tying the loops off. Now her breasts were completely enclosed on all sides with rope, and the tightness of the coils made them bulge outward from her slender form like a pair of ripe melons.

"Mmmmm very nice. Now bring your arms down and place your hands behind you palm to palm," Sonia ordered.

Amber could feel the ropes pressing up under her arms as she lowered them and offered Sonia the hands behind her back. Once again, more rope was looped and tightened around her tiny wrists, then cinched and knotted off where Amber's fingers could not reach them.

"You are going to love this!" 

Sonia picked up another, longer piece of rope. She then doubled and looped the ends before wrapping them up Amber's arms, just above her elbows, pulling the rope ends through the loop. Carefully, Sonia adjusted the loop just above the elbows and began tightening the loop until her elbows were almost drawn together before wrapping the rope several times around her arms. Amber could not believe the way she was being tied up, and though Sonia had hardly begun, she already knew there would no getting out of this. As Sonia pulled the cinching tight, the ropes around Amber's arms also tightened, pulling her elbows together until they touched. Amber gasped in shock when she felt her elbows kiss each other.

"Oh my," Sonia sounded very impressed. "You're quite limber, aren't you?" 

"Yes, Ma'am," Amber whispered. 

"That's good. You'll need that flexibility for what I have planned next."

Amber had no idea what she meant, but just hearing those words raised her level of excitement even higher. She stared at her own reflection in the mirror with utter fascination. The way her elbows were locked together dramatically altered her posture. Her arms and shoulders were pulled sharply back which forced her to stand much more erect than before, her round, captive tits thrust forward very enticingly.

"On your knees."

Sonia placed her hands on Amber's shoulders to steady her as she lowered herself down to one knee, then the other.

"Now remain still."

She threaded one end of a rope between Amber's bound elbows and breast ropes behind her back, then let both ends drop to the floor. Amber had a good idea what was coming next, and Sonia quickly confirmed her suspicions by passing the ends between her knees and threading them through the ropes around her breasts in front. Carefully, Sonia parted her labia and inserted the ropes between them before pulling them tight. Amber moaned and squirmed when she felt the ropes pressing hard against her crotch.

"I said, remain still."

Amber didn't move, but she continued to moan loudly. She couldn't help herself, she was so aroused. Sonia kept pulling in the slack, pushing the ropes deeper and deeper into her tender folds. After the ropes were stretched as tight as they would go, Sonia tied both ends to the breasts ropes. 

"This is called a variable crotch rope," she said. "The more you struggle, the more it will rub on that hot little pus of yours -- not that you'll have any wiggle room left once I'm finished tying you up." She continued, "Now for your legs."

Amber waited nervously as Sonia leisurely selected and uncoiled three more long strands of rope. 

"Just how much more rope was she planning to use?" she thought.

Swiftly and efficiently, Sonia bound Amber's legs together, tightening, cinching and knotting loops around the ankles, above and below the knees, and around her upper thighs. Amber stared at the bound image of herself in the mirror. Freedom was fast becoming a remote impossibility. It would be easier to reach the stars than to escape her bindings now.

Carefully, Sonia lowered her onto the carpet. In doing so, Amber felt the two crotch ropes began to shift inside her, eliciting another string of moans. Then as Amber lay helplessly prone on her side, Sonia grasped the ankle ropes and forced her legs backward, making them bend at the knees. She held Amber's feet with one hand, and passed another piece of rope around the wrist ropes, then around the ankle ropes two times.

"Now comes the fun part," she quipped.

Slowly, Sonia began pulling on the link rope, drawing Amber's ankles toward her wrists. Amber moaned again as Sonia kept up the steady pressure, forcing her to arch her body backward to accommodate the stress until her feet touched her outstretched fingers. Then swiftly, Sonia tied off the link rope to keep it in place. 

"There, all trussed up nice and tight," Sonia spoke with great satisfaction and pride evident in her voice. "See if you can get loose."

Amber had no desire to put her own helplessness on display for the mistress, but she also realized it was only human nature to want to test her bonds, to see if escape was, in any way, possible at all. So she began to squirm on the floor and immediately felt the ropes tighten around her body, biting into the softer parts of her flesh. The sudden feeling of being constricted threw her into a panic. For a moment, she couldn't think straight, and reacted on instinct, like an animal caught in a snare. 

Sonia sat back and watched in amusement while Amber bucked and strained against the ropes. She tried reaching for the knots, but they were well-positioned and just out of reach from her groping fingers. Then slowly it dawned upon Amber that the harder she struggled the more insistently the two crotch ropes rubbed into her smooth cleft. Her panic melted away as her mind began to focus on the growing warmth in her loins, brought on by the ropes. She felt them pressing against her clit as it swelled. It was driving her wild. She needed to cum so badly it hurt. Totally forgetting the immediate presence of her mistress, she began humping against the crotch ropes in a frenzy of total abandon. The pressure built and built inside her until she could no longer stand it, and then Amber climaxed in a titanic shuddering orgasm. She jerked convulsively against her restraints, then cried out loud while she came and came, leaving her drained and spent. As she slowly regained awareness of the world around her, she noticed Sonia staring at her in amazement. Acutely embarrassed, Amber blushed and turned her head away, defeat writ large on her beautiful face. 

"That was quite a performance," Sonia finally commented, "I have to say, it even left me a little hot under the collar."

The panic began to set in again as Amber's mind cleared. Her muscles ached terribly now from her struggling. The orgasm seemed to drain all of her strength, and the ropes felt even more restrictive, if that was even possible. 

"Well you've had your fun. Now you're going to learn just how a simple hogtie can turn a very pleasurable experience into a painful one after you've been left in this for a while."

"It's . . . it's too tight," Amber gasped. 

"Nothing like your little rope session with Raven, is it?" There was a trace of spite in Sonia's cheerful tone. "Now I have just one more final touch to add before we're finished."

"God, what MORE could she do?" Amber thought to herself. 

Sonia reached into the cabinet and pulled out a pair of concave-shaped chrome metal disks, measuring about the size of a silver dollar in diameter. She crouched down close to Amber, holding them in each hand so she could get a good look at them. Each disk had a small hole in the center and pointed outer edges that curved inward like claws.

"Do you know what these are?" She rolled the pointed objects between her fingers in a teasing display.

"No, Mistress."

"They're called nipple shields. Quite attractive aren't they? Though the name is somewhat misleading since the nipples themselves are exposed through these holes. Women generally wear them as jewelry because they give the nipples that constant, noticeable and ERECT look that men cannot resist. However, when adjusted correctly, they become a very effective tool for punishment.
Here . . . let me show you."

Amber held her breath while Sonia tweaked her nipples with a fingernail until they responded, then fitted a shield over each breast by forcing the hardened nipple through its open end.

"See this ringset around the opening? Turning it makes the hole contract about the base of the nipple in much the same way as a clamp, only the mechanism allows for very precise, controlled tuning as the pressure increases."

Slowly she tightened the rings, and Amber immediately felt the openings close in around her nipples.

"Mistress, please!" Amber begged. "Not there! Please take them off?" 

"Are you telling me what to do?"

"No, Mistress."

"Then quit your babbling," Sonia ordered, "it'll only make it worse."

There was nothing Amber could do, but watch wide-eyed, as Sonia increased the tension on the clamps until she was satisfied they could not be pulled off. Then she tugged on them, and each time she did, Amber flinched.

"There," Sonia began massaging her breasts. "Now that wasn't so bad, was it?"

"They . . . they hurt."

"Well of course they hurt, dear. Why do you think I put them on?"

Sonia teasingly brushed her thumbs across both nipples. Amber let out a cry and bit her lip. Her swollen nubs were so sensitive now, that even the lightest touch of a finger felt like course sandpaper.

"Now to do something about that incessant moaning," and leaving Amber to squirm silently on the floor, Sonia went back to the cabinet and pulled out something made of leather, "This should so the trick."

It was a full-head leather hood, Amber saw, with no eyeholes, or even an opening for the mouth -- just a pair of nostril holes to breath through. It was laced in back, ensuring that her whole head would be encased within. Then Sonia showed her the inside.

"And here is something for you to suck on."

Amber drew in a breath when she saw what was stitched into the mask where the mouth was supposed to be. It was matte black and made of soft rubber, a little over three inches long and about half that in diameter, and realistically molded into the shape of man's penis.

"Now hon, you can't tell me that you've never had anything of a similar shape in that pretty mouth of yours?"

Without even waiting for an answer, Sonia gently but firmly fitted the penis-gag into her mouth, and then wrapped the leather hood around her head, checking that the nostrils were properly aligned with the two holes. Then she began to lace the back together, tightly, leaving only a space at the top for Amber's long chestnut hair.

"Any problems, slave girl?"

Amber shook her head gently. The rubber penis filled her mouth, stretching her cheeks, so much that she was forced to breath through her nose and the holes in the mask. The sharp-sweet scent of black leather was almost intoxicating each time she inhaled.

"I think we're all finished," Sonia announced. 

"MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMppppphhhhh!"

"I know, sweetheart. It's overwhelming isn't it? So much happening to your body all at once. So many feelings to deal with. Pain. Arousal. Anguish. Helplessness. And those pesky ropes -- they just seem to get tighter, don't they?" Sonia laughed. "Well you will certainly have a lot to think about while I'm gone."

Amber could vaguely make out the sound of Sonia's voice through the leather over her ears.

"I'll be back in little while to release you, so don't run away, hon. Chio!"

Then she heard the door slam shut. A heavy silence descended on the room. Amber was alone. Helpless and alone. The leather mask blocked out her sight completely, not even allowing a speck of light to come through, and the only sounds that could be heard were the sounds of her own hollow breaths. Her whole universe seemed to shrink inward.

Lying motionless on her side, Amber tried to imagine how she must have appeared -- fully immobilized with her arms and legs bent sharply backward, wrists and ankles bound together, her normally attractive features contorted into a painfully tight living package of feminine helplessness. She could really feel the tightness of the ropes now; all-encompassing; consuming her very being. The nipple clamps only increased her torment as sharp twinges of pain flashed through her jutting breasts, and tied as she was, Amber could do nothing to relieve them.

How long would it be before Sonia came back to release her? Would it be minutes? Hours? The thought of being hog-tied for that long was unnerving, and yet at the same time, it excited her.

Dreamily, Amber strained against the unyielding ropes, relishing the way they tightened and loosened as she flexed her muscles. Sonia had certainly done an excellent job of tying her up! The knots were totally inaccessible and too tight for Amber to wriggle her way to freedom.

Minutes passed, and yet the pressure building in her shoulders, arms, legs and back made it feel as though she had been bound for hours. She was also becoming very aware of the rug beneath her, and how its stiff, upright fibers were pressing deeper into her delicate skin. 

Amber began rocking back and forth, with the hope of rolling over to relieve that side of her body. She moaned and strained against the ropes, the course hemp biting into her naked flesh felt heavenly against her. Again and again, she rocked, and with some effort, she was able to roll onto her stomach, but in doing so, crushed her breasts into the carpet. Amber yelped as the clamps bore into her nipples. She managed to arch her back and keep her bound tits clear of the stiff carpet fibers, which was more than she could do for her pubic area -- her newly shaved, unprotected and fully aroused pussy, which was starting to send her some rather exciting signals.

It was easier to roll over to the other side from her stomach, but the whole effort left her drained and fatigued. Her body was sweating all over, and the heat inside her mask was stifling. Worse yet, she could feel another orgasm building. Just the slightest twitch and those wickedly devilish crotch ropes would start shifting, rubbing against her.

Amber knew there was no use in fighting the signals her body was sending, and it was certainly likely, there would be many more orgasms until Sonia came back to release her. With that in mind, she began to move her hips slowly, more rhythmically, then she laid her head back and waited for the fireworks . . .

Indoctrintation
by Night Owl

My hands and heart were bound
Knots tied most tenderly,
Secured but not too tight
You worked so cleverly.
My legs were gently spread
As if in trance i didn't fight,
Though wrapped in ropes 
You dashed my hopes
Of forgiving me this night.

Chapter 11: One Step Closer

Sonia had not been away for more than an hour, but when she got back, Amber was already in a world of her own and didn't even hear her arrival. She turned on the overhead light, quietly unpacked the digital camcorder, then proceeded to film the girl as she moaned and writhed helplessly on the carpet. Looking through the LCD somehow separated her from the experience, but she enjoyed zooming in on Amber's bound tits and watching the ropes in her crotch work their magic.

After getting the shots she wanted, Sonia placed the camcorder on a tri-pod and angled it downward to capture the girl's image on the LCD. She donned a small black mask that was just large enough to cover her eyes. She did this because the sessions were often filmed -- the recordings used to promote upcoming auctions or played back at social gatherings to entertain the guests; so as a precaution, she always tried to conceal her identity, in case one of them ended up in the wrong hands. Sonia moved in front of the camera and knelt down close to Amber, then sat back on her heels for a moment to admire her own handiwork.

Hogties were always exquisite, and on this flexible girl, it created a fantastic amount of arch on the body. The ropes were rubbing against her naked flesh in all the right places, her moans rising in pitch and length. The long dildo stitched inside her leather hood was also doing its job in keeping her mouth busy. It was an incredibly arousing sight, and Sonia felt her own body grow damp with admiration. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
She reached forward and ran her hand up Amber's thigh, and with a shudder, the girl realized for the first time that she was not alone. 

"Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmphttt!" She drooled a muffled whimper past the dildo.

Her body felt very warm and slick with perspiration. Her reddened flesh was rubbed raw in some places by the carpet's rough fibers. Sonia placed her hand on the girl's head, now encased entirely in thick, black leather, with just a few breathing holes under the nose for air. The mask was like an oven, and there was always a danger of heat exhaustion at this stage, so the mistress knew she would have to work fast.

She began to massage the girl's breasts. The pressure of the ropes made them swell like a pair of ripe melons and turn slightly purple in color. Sonia lovingly ran her hands up and down the her bound limbs, then back to her breasts to massage them again, while being mindful not to touch the clamps on her nipples. She felt Amber begin to relax and respond to the gentle caresses. 

Sonia was always intrigued with this part of the training -- the dichotomy between pain and pleasure. She had seen it many times. The body would be tense one moment, with every muscle screaming for relief from the tension of bondage. Then, as the mind learned to accept the pain, more pleasurable sensations would take over, and increase with intensity, until they finally culminate into a magnificent climax of the senses. After her orgasm, the bound submissive relaxes again, but only to feel the pain return again with a vengeance. This cycle could last for hours, so it was the trainer's responsibility to watch for breathing problems, circulation problems, and hyperventilation.&nbsp; 

Feeling a little sympathetic, Sonia carefully removed the clamps from Amber's breasts, and in doing so, heard a faint sigh of relief behind the hood. Leaving the nipples clamped for an extended period of time always made them painfully sensitive -- or perhaps the girl thought her ropes would come off next.

Sonia smiled at this, "Sorry, hon," she spoke to Amber in a sultry voice, "but I'm not quite through with you yet."

Fingers slithered up her torso and pinched one swollen nipple. 

"Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmph!" A cry answered -- an unintelligible sound of agony and ecstasy. 

The girl was helpless, completely at her mercy, and at the moment, Sonia wasn't showing her any. Her finger nails scraped the peak of Amber's nipples again, making her body surge painfully against the ropes. Sonia, in turn, felt her own lust rising, incredibly exhilarated and empowered by her transformation of this innocent girl into a sexual plaything, hers to do with as she pleased. She ran her hands along the crotch ropes, then gently pulled them aside. A gasp exploded from Amber's nose as Sonia's fingers slid over her swollen nether lips and into her sex, gliding easily over the wet, glistening flesh. Amber whined and struggled again with her ropes. Sonia could almost feel the devastating arousal shooting through the girl's body and her inability to move only seemed to triple the intensity of the stimulation being forced on her. Sonia's thumb found her clit and as she rubbed the hard, protruding nub, Amber gave a deep groan of despairing pleasure, then her body signaled its surrender with tiny forward jerks of her pelvis, as if to impale itself on Sonia's probing fingers. 

"Not yet, hon. Not yet," and to Amber's disappointment, she removed her hand.

"MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMPHHHH!"

Sonia waited and listened until her breathing slowed, then resumed the stimulation of her clit, once more bringing Amber to the brink of orgasm, only to deny her again by taking her hand away. She did this two more times. By then, the poor little wretch was desperate. Sonia could hear her murmuring in the mask, her mouth moving around the leather dildo and trying to form words. It was time.

"Are you asking me to finish you, dear?" 

She nodded her head 'yes'.

"Then go on," Sonia whispered, "show me how good it feels and cum for your mistress." Sonia began rubbing Amber's clit again, while squeezing her breasts with the other hand. 

This time it didn't take long for Amber to reach the climax she had been begging for. Her moans melted into a sort humming purr behind the mask, then grew louder as the long-awaited orgasm rumbled through her body like an earthquake,

"Mmmmmph! Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmppppppphhhhhh! Mmmmmmmmmmph" 

She jerked and shuddered against the ropes; fresh sweat glistened off her breasts, arms and thighs, and the moan in her voice jagged almost into a squeal. Sonia waited patiently for the orgasm to subside. She waited for the reality of bondage to sink into the girl's consciousness. In a matter of minutes, Amber was sobbing again, her normally attractive features contorted with strain and anguish as her muscles screamed in pain, and the harshly tied ropes tore at her ankles and wrists.

"We're done for now," Sonia advised her, "but for now on, you will not cum unless given permission to do so. You will not masturbate, or even touch your breasts for your own pleasure. Understood?"

Amber nodded again, without hesitation. She panted gently as Sonia removed the restraints. The hood came off first and the intrusive dildo pulled from her mouth. She gasped when she saw the camcorder, but said nothing. It took several minutes for Amber to stand on her feet in her weakened condition, but Sonia was patient with her. Together they made their way through the house and back down the steps to the cellar. By then, her legs were losing their rubbery quality and she was able to walk on her own.

"I'll have some water and food brought in for you," Sonia fastened her chain leash to the wall, "then I suggest you get some rest."

"Yes, Mistress," Amber whispered meekly, then she laid back on her cot. Within minutes after Sonia locked her cell door, she was already fast asleep.


---------------


As Sonia emerged from the cellar, she met Raven who had been waiting for her at the bottom of the staircase in the foyer.

"So how is she doing?"

"Quite well, her behavioral training is progressing faster than we expected. Physically, she already has the stamina, even for the more advanced Japanese techniques."

"Very good," Raven seemed very pleased to hear this, rope bondage being his personal favorite.

Sonia continued with her assessment, "As for sexual readiness, I think she's a little too narrow in front, so tonight I will work on stretching her a bit. One session should do it. The other end though needs more work, so I would like your permission to have her wear a plug for the next twenty-four hours."

"Not too much, mind you," Raven cautioned her, "most of our male client's prefer a tighter drum than a loose one." 

"So I've heard," Sonia turned to the staircase.

"One more thing," he called to her, "Beginning tomorrow, I want you to double your efforts in completing Livia's training. Mr. Quinn has taken an interest in her, and has agreed to accepting her in exchange for Jerri. Of course, this will take up much of your time, so I'll handle Amber's training until you're finished."

"Are you sure it would be wise to switch trainers so early in the process?"

"I'm more concerned about Livia. If she turns out to be as disagreeable as Jerri was, then we'll lose one of our best clients. I want you to handle this one personally."

Sonia felt the heat inside her build once again. She knew Raven was using Livia as an excuse to take Amber for himself, and if there was any damage to her behavior as a result, then it would be up to her to pick up the pieces and complete the training. She could see it coming, just as it happened with Jerri, and there was nothing she could do about it.

"Yes sir," she fought to hide her anger. "Do you still want me handle the session tonight?"

"Yes, and I believe she is scheduled for a whipping in the morning. Make that your last session, and I'll take over from then on. Mr. Santos will be our guest tomorrow evening. He's been asking about the girl, so I'm thinking of assigning her to him." 

Carlo Santos was one of the men that attended Raven's first session with Amber. Sonia knew Raven was pushing to get all of the girls ready for their next auction, but to pair up a new slave with a guest so early in her training would be a mistake in her opinion, and as the new head trainer, she felt obligated to say something about it.

"I don't think she's quite ready to entertain clients, yet," Sonia chose her words carefully. "Perhaps you should find some one else for Mr. Santos this time, and maybe have the girl watch." 

Raven paused a moment, as if he were considering the problem carefully. Sonia also noticed his eyes grow darker with displeasure over her comment. 

"I'll take it under advisement," he finally answered, "and remember, don't loosen her too much." 

"Whatever you say," Sonia turned and climbed the stairs. "You're a better judge than I."

 
---------------


Slowly, Amber sat up on her cot and swung her legs to the side, resting her feet on the cold floor. She had no idea how long she had slept; no knowledge of if it was night or day in her windowless cell. Her wrists were cuffed with a twelve inch chain fastened between them. Another chain ran from the back of her collar to the wall next to her, but at least she had some freedom to move around the room. Rolling her head gently from side to side, she tried to work the kinks out of her neck. The links of chain from her collar were dangling beside her now, and the tinkling sounded very erotic to her ears. Looking down, Amber could still see traces of rope marks left on her smooth almond skin. They formed zebra-like patterns on her legs, wrists and ankles, and around her breasts.

She raised her arms high and began to stretch, twisting her upper body from side to side. Groans came easy to her lips, softly escaping. Damn! She hadn't felt this worked over since . . . when? She bent at her waist and reached out with her fingers as far as she could, slowly stretching out the muscles in her back, then gazed about the room. A large moth fluttered around the bare bulb that burned above, and landed on the sink. The door, of course, was locked, dashing any brief hopes of escape.

Amber stood up and slowly spread her legs. The muscles of her thighs and calves protested silently as she bent over, running her hands slowly down the backs of her legs, massaging her hamstrings. If nothing else, she knew that she needed to prepare her body for whatever came next. She slowly stood upright, her hands going up over her head, her fingers reaching for the ceiling. Her eyes darted up to the camera over the door. Amber knew someone was watching her, but she didn't care anymore. After all, what was there about her that everybody hadn't already seen? She locked her fingers together and bent backwards, very slowly, pushing her breasts forward. More moans flowed softly from her lips as her body tried to relieve the tensions that her oh-so-strict bondage had caused. She closed her eyes and licked her lips. The memory of being hogtied was still fresh in her mind, she could still feel the ropes around her, in fact. Sonia had tied her up so expertly, so completely. Amber started to lubricate again just thinking about it. She shook her head in dismay with herself and went to the sink. After splashing cold water on her face, she used the toilet then returned to her bed.

Suddenly she heard the dead bolt slide and the door opened. Monique entered the room. Without a word, she set a covered tray on the bed and left, locking the door behind her. While she had barely been able to choke down lunch, Amber attacked the broiled scallops like she had not eaten for a week. 

Another hour had passed before the door opened again. This time it was Shane. 

"On your feet," he ordered.

Amber felt herself turn pale as he unhooked her collar from the chain. He said nothing else until they were out of the room and away from the camera. His mood seemed more serious than usual. 

"So have you kept our secret?"
 
"Yes, Sir."&nbsp; 
 
"Good," his voice sounded relieved, "I heard you had a rough session with Sonia today. I think I can get her to ease up a bit next time, then I'll see about getting you out of here. All you have to do is keep her mouth shut. Understood?"
 
Amber only nodded. She knew Shane had no intention of talking to Sonia, and that last night's visit would not be the last, but she had no choice other than to let the man have his way and hope he would quickly grow tired of her. 

Once again, she was taken to the shower stalls, where Monique was waiting with soap and sponge in hand. Hours of sweat were washed and rinsed away, then her body was quickly toweled off and rubbed down with scented oil. Shane seemed to take pleasure in watching Monique work the oil into her skin while Amber stood like a statue with her arms shackled high above her head. She was then released, only to have her wrists locked to her sides by use of a thick leather belt fastened around her waist. 

When Monique was finished, she turned to Shane, though dared not look him in the eyes.&nbsp; 

"Mistress Sonia said I am to bring the girl myself, Sir," she whispered to him tentatively.

"Of course she did," Shane grunted his displeasure, "then I guess you better get to it." He then turned to Amber, "I'll see YOU later," he said with a grin before leaving the room. It was a bold move with Monique standing there, but Amber wondered if the other slaves had suffered the same fate with Shane, and like herself, were cowed into keeping their own secret about the handler and his night time 'visits.' Monique gave no indication of this, of course, but merely guided Amber quietly out the shower room and down the hall. It was then, Amber took notice of her dress - a long piece of cloth made of silk, draped over one shoulder and belted loosely around the hips with a gold cord. The cloth was so sheer that one could see the faint outline of her body underneath even in the dim torchlight, which was more Amber could claim for herself. With the exception of her restraints and collar, she was completely naked, and had been for the most part since her abduction.

As they moved down the hall, she became aware of a low murmuring sound that seemed to be coming from an open doorway ahead of them. Amber felt her heart beat faster. Someone was obviously in a great deal of pain. The noises grew louder as they reached the doorway, then her eyes followed the sounds into a darkened room, where torches flickered warm light off the pale form of a woman suspended almost six feet in the air. It was Marin. Her long dark hair snaked in wet strands against her face, almost covering it completely, but there was no mistaking who it was. Her wrists and ankles had been cuffed together behind her, then fastened to a hook above, forcing the rest of her body to bend backward like a bow. The hook was on the end of some stout-looking sash cord that ran through a pulley fastened to an exposed beam, then down to a small hand wench bolted into the wall. Amber shuddered at the makeshift way the system had been installed, and as if that were not tough enough for Marin, a long piece of hemp rope had also been looped several times around her narrow waist with a 40 lbs. dumbbell weight tied to the other end, pulling her taut belly downward and forcing her body into an even deeper arch.&nbsp;&nbsp; 

Marin had the figure of a ballet dancer - thin, supple, almost swan-like, and even though dancers were extremely athletic, Amber could tell she was in a great deal of pain. Every muscle, every tendon in her arms, legs, and thighs seemed to pop through her skin as they bore the full weight of her suspension. She looked a deathly pale too, almost achromatic against the dark stone masonry. Only her nipples showed any color as they stood out pink and pebbled from the rest of her frail body. 

Then Tony, one of the handlers, appeared from behind the door frame. In his hand was a flogger with a studded handle and long leather strands. Marin hung there, slowly revolving in the torch light. Her bald pubis was extraordinarily vulnerable with her legs drawn so high up behind her. Without warning, Tony swung the flogger and struck her against the thigh. Marin screamed. Her body jerked on the cord, causing it to sway and turn in mid-air. He didn't wait for her screams to subside though, but struck her again and again. Each blow left an angry red mark against her white flesh. He struck her eight times with the flogger, then stopped, but only to turn the handle on her and use it as a dildo. He teased her at first by rubbing the chrome tip against her folds until she was well-lubricated, then pushed it all the way in.

"Mnnh! Mnnh! Mnnh! Mnnh!" came her moans. A stream of drool fell from her gagged mouth.

Amber stood entranced, unable to turn her eyes away from the spectacle, then she heard Tony's voice,

"Like to give it a try?"

He was looking at her now. Talking to her! Amber stared back at him, wide-eyed, then at Marin, before taking a step backward. The stocky dark haired Italian laughed at her, then spun Marin around and began whipping her small breasts with the flogger.

"We should go," Monique finally said. Amber breathed a sigh of relief as they turned away, and together they continued down the hall, leaving Marin and the sounds of her muffled cries behind them.

They entered the another room, this one brightly lit with candelabras sitting around a large oak table. Sonia stood waiting with Shii Ann and Livia standing at attention to either side of her. The scene was like something out of a Bram Stoker novel. Both slaves were clad in the same type of revealing garment Monique was wearing. Only Sonia was fully clothed in a white blouse, black pants and spiky boots. 

"Sit on the edge of this table," she ordered, "right here."

Reluctantly, Amber stepped forward to the spot where she was pointing, while Shii Ann and Livia took their positions at either end of the table. Black leather straps were fastened to all four corners, and four more in the middle. She stared nervously at them as Monique removed the belt and cuffs from her waist. There was no question now as to what would happen next. Monique guided her to the table and motioned her to sit down. She could feel the cold, rough surface underneath her as she sat in the table's edge. 

"Now scoot your pretty ass back, sweetheart, and lie down for me," Sonia told her.

It was then, Amber noticed the camcorder for the first time, sitting on its tripod and pointed directly at her. Suddenly, the mistress grabbed Amber's leash and gave it a sharp jerk, forcing her to fall backward on her elbows.

"When I give an order I expect you to follow it, understood?" Sonia scolded her. "Now lie down."

Amber didn't hesitate this time, and immediately the other girls took hold of her wrists and ankles, then pulled them to the corners of the table. 

"Stretch her limbs tight," Sonia advised, "I don't want them flopping around."

The girls tugged and pulled, then secured her the table so her body would remain stretched tight. The other straps were fastened to her mid-section -- above and below her breasts, and around each thigh. The candles flickered, casting a warm glow on her skin, now glistening with scented oil. 

Amber knew she was the centerpiece of some bizarre ritual that was about to take place. She watched helplessly as Monique took the camcorder from the tripod and circled the table slowly so that every naked curve would be recorded from all angles. She wondered what the tapes were used for. Would they be kept for themselves? Or, would they be shared with others at some social gathering. Amber thought Raven had said something once about posting images of her on the Internet, but so much had happened since then, she couldn't be sure anymore. If it were true, then what was about to happen could be seen by virtually anyone with access to a computer and modem. Amber imagined she must have made quite a sight, and couldn't help wondering how many men would soon be jacking off to the image of her bound, naked and spread. The thought should have devastating her, but at this point, after all that had happened to her thus far, she just felt numb.

Sonia turned to Shii Ann and Livia, and nodded

Suddenly, the slaves descended upon Amber, and smothered the palms of her hands with wet, open kisses. Their mouths trailed up her arms where her armpits lay stretched and waiting. Amber drew in a hot breath, then a sigh as their tongues swirled eagerly around her moist hollows. Meanwhile, Monique had taken her place at the foot of the table and began messaging her inner thighs, tracing first around, then over the low hill of her shaved mons to her labia. Sonia took control of the camcorder and filmed the whole episode. Shii Ann's kissing turned to Amber's breasts, and Livia immediately followed suit. They lapped and suckled her nipples until they responded. Out came a procession of low, sharp inhalations from Amber, each one escaping despite her very best efforts. 

Monique also joined in the kissing. Her long blonde hair spilled over Amber's open thighs as she lowered her head to explore the smooth furrow that had once been covered with hair. Her outer lips began to recede, exposing the pearl of her womanhood. Monique immediately turned her attention to it and slithered her wet, snake-like tongue around the tender nub, using slow, rhythmic motions until Amber's sex was well-lubricated and ready to be explored.

Shii Ann and Livia continued their assault on her upper body. Their wet tongues traveled down her ribs and across her belly, then back up to the breasts, leaving a trail of saliva in their wake. Amber drew hot breaths and moans in approval. For a moment, she had forgotten where she was and what was happening around her, her mind focused completely inward . . .

 "Enough," Sonia snapped her fingers. The three slaves immediately backed away, much to Amber's disappointment. "Now leave us." 

Monique and the other girls filed out of the room, leaving Amber and Sonia alone together. The camera had been placed back on the tripod, but the red 'record' light was still on. Without saying another word, Sonia walked over to a closet and pulled out a long metallic case that measured about 12 in. x 36 in. in length. She set the box on the table between Amber's legs. Amber lifted her head off the table, her eyes widened in horror when the top of the case was lifted to reveal what was inside. 

"Oh, p-please . . . God no . . ." her voice stammered with the realization of what was about to happen to her.

The steel rod was attached to a motor at one end, and on the other, pointed directly at her, was a long vibrator, made of soft black rubber and molded into the shape of a man's penis. It measured an alarming 12 inches in length and at least 2 inches in diameter, its shaft was deeply ribbed and already lubricated.

"This is a fucking machine, or as we like to call it, The Penetrator. It is powered by a 4.5 amp motor, and it can pump as fast as 80 rmp's. The shaft is made of durable steel pipe and can accommodate several attachment sizes, depending on what you want, whether it be for pleasure or discipline. Tonight we're going to use the 12 inch attachment, and adjust the stroke to 40 rmp's to widen that pretty hole of yours."

Sonia positioned the machine carefully, with the cock head about 2 inches away from Amber's vagina. She then lined up the four holes at the base of the motor housing with two rows of threaded holes in the table and ratcheted it down with loose bolts that were inside the case.

"You may feel some discomfort with this at first," Sonia consoled her, "but it's well-lubed so there won't be any physical damage to your reproductive organs."

She flipped a switch and the motor hummed steadily as the wheels and cranks began to turn, pushing the vibrating rod forward to within about an inch touching Amber, and then back. Sweat broke out on her forehead, in her armpits and thighs with anticipation of what was about to happen to her. Despite her twisting and squirming, she could not evade the penis-shaped rod as it slowly crept closer and closer to her spayed lips with each rotation. 

Meanwhile, Sonia was busy with the camcorder. She zoomed in on Amber to record her facial expressions, then panned down to the machine as it inched its way closer. Amber whimpered as she felt the vibrating head press against her only briefly before retreating again; the next rotation actually penetrated her.

"Try to relax, hon, it's best if you don't fight it."

The pressure was intense due to its size. At first, Amber tried to clench her thigh muscles to keep the intruder out, but that only made it more painful. Her only choice was to take Sonia's advice and relax her body. Again and again the rubber cock teased her with each rotation. One inch, and Amber moaned. Two inches, she moaned even louder and began to move her hips around it. Despite her attempt to accommodate the intruder, it was still very painful. She pulled on the restraints, but they held firm in keeping her limbs stretched on the table while the monstrous device probed deeper and deeper into her vaginal passage. Feelings of pain, pleasure, degradation, and wanting flooded her mind.

"By the way, dear, you ARE permitted to cum as much as you like," Sonia told her. "Consider it a parting gift from me to you." 

Amber didn't even hear the last comment. The monster cock moved six inches, then seven, deeper than she has ever felt before. At eight inches it stopped advancing, but continued to move back and forth inside her, stretching the walls of her vagina and stimulating every nerve ending. Then suddenly, it hit her, like a tidal wave crashing onto the beach. Amber screamed as a painful climax swept throughout her body.

Sonia placed the camcorder back on the tripod, then shut it off. She had no intention of filming what was about to happen next. Amber was already well-into her second orgasm while she removed her clothes, leaving only her spiky boots. She slowly climbed onto the table. When Amber opened her eyes, she saw Sonia looking down at her, the mistress's fiery red hair almost touching her face. 

"You've had yours," she whispered, "now it's my turn."

Amber licked her dry lips and tried to speak, buy before she could, Sonia kissed her. 

"Fair's fair," she murmured, and her long serpent-like tongue slipped into Amber's mouth. Sonia lowered herself on Amber's body, so together, they could enjoy the machine's thrusting movements. Amber could feel Sonia's breasts pressed against her breasts, her warm belly against hers. Again, they kissed. Sonia began rocking her body forward, rubbing her neatly shaved bush against Amber's smooth cleft. Amber tilted her head back and moaned. Sonia kissed her neck. As Amber enjoyed her third climax, Sonia shifted her body downward, just enough, so she could feel the moving machine cock against her, then raised her body up until she was straddle it. Amber watched as Sonia through her head back and moaned. Her body tensed, shuttered, then relaxed.

Sonia fell back on Amber, and together, the two women enjoyed the warmth of each other's bodies for a moment or two, then Sonia climbed off, and it was business as usual. 

The machine was removed and carefully put away. As Sonia got dressed, she said nothing to Amber. Monique was then summoned back into the room.

"You will be taken back to your cell now, but as you sleep tonight, you will wearing this . . ."

Sonia held up a leather belt with a strap underneath for the crotch. Fastened to the strap, was an black rubber shaft simulating an erect penis, which was obviously designed to be inserted behind and held in place with the belt. 

"This little device is designed to stretch that little hole in your back end," Sonia told her. "One night quartered like this should be sufficient in stretching you; in the morning it will be removed. Then we'll go through the same process every week or so, to make certain you remain that way."

So Amber was forced to lie prone on the table, while Monique fastened belt around her lower body. 

"Consider yourself lucky," Sonia told her. "Some of the girls that come through here have to wear the belt for days at a time, even while working on the grounds where everyone can see them."

The belt was tightened around the hips and up through the crease of her buttocks so that the internal muscles inside her could not expel the dildo. A leather front covered her completely so as to prevent anyone from penetrating her.

Amber lay awake for quite some time, after she was taken back to her cell. The dildo felt uncomfortable inside her, and with her arms and legs strapped to her bed, there was no way she could take the belt off, if she dared to. She wondered if Shane would make good of his threat and pay her a visit, in spite of the belt, but he never showed. Hours seemed to pass before she finally drifted off to sleep . . .

"Get up, Amber, GET UP!"

Amber's eyes popped open. That was Rob's voice. It sounded faint, almost far off, but there was no mistaking who it was. Rob had finally come to save her!

"Get up," he repeated. "For cryin' out loud, girl, show a little respect for yourself . . . and put some clothes on."

She tried to do as he said and get up, but something was holding her down. Of course! She had forgotten she was tied to the bed. Or was she? Looking around Amber knew something was wrong. Someone had hogtied her, and she wasn't in her cell&nbsp; anymore, but lying in a clearing, surrounded by a thick forest of tall trees. 

"Rob!" She cried out. 

There was no sign of him.

"Rob, come untie me, PLEASE!"

Again, no answer.

The insects of the forest began to stir with the sound of her voice. All around her, the vegetation was very thick and lush, and somewhere above, the sun shown brightly, but its warm rays could not penetrate the trees, leaving everything below shrouded in darkness. Her body felt cold and clammy. The wet leaves that carpeted the ground smelled of rot and decay. Amber tried to move again, but it was no use. This hogtie was not as painful as the one Sonia had her in the day before, but it was still tight enough to keep her from moving. She could feel the ropes criss-crossing her body, around her breasts, her arms and legs, and pulling tightly up between her thighs. It felt nice, having them pressed up against her like that.

"Amber, honey, please get up!" 

"M-mother?" Amber cried out to the forest. Suddenly she felt very ashamed.

"Amber how could you do this to yourself?"

"Mom . . . it's not my fault," Amber pleaded with the voice of a little girl. "They made me do it!"

"I'm sorry hon, but your father will have to know about this."

"Mom . . . MOTHER," she begged. "Please don't tell dad! He'll FREAK!"

Suddenly she felt something cold and wet grab her arm from under the leaves. The ground turned soft, like quicksand. All around her, the trees came to life, their roots reaching out to pull her under. 

"Oh, Mother . . . please! Don't let them take me!"

"Why shouldn't I? You seem to like this place," her mother's voice started to change into something else. Something familiar. "If you really wanted to leave, then you should have told them, but you didn't because you know you belong here."

The slimy tree roots were all around her, and tightening their grip. Amber felt her body sinking.

"MOM! I can't breath . . ."

"Serves you right, dear . . ." 

Her mother was no longer there now. 

"Serves you right for being such a naughty little girl!"

 Then Amber recognized the new voice as it laughed. It was Sonia.


---------------


Amber awoke with start. Looking around the room, she drew a sigh of relief. She was still lying in her cell. Safe and sound.

"Just another dream," she thought, "and a pretty bad one at that."

She laid her head back and stared at the ceiling, 

"But what kind of nightmare did I wake up into?"

Chapter 12: A Day in Her New Life

"There," Sonia nodded with approval, "that should keep you loose enough for now, at least until you're sold."

Just as she had promised, the chastity belt was removed that morning, freeing the opening in Amber's tail end from the intrusive dildo. Being a virgin when it came to anal sex, she couldn't imagine anyone, man or woman, wanting to do such a thing. On the other hand, she couldn't deny how turned on she was after sleeping with the shape of a man's erect penis inside her all night. 

Before her meal, Amber was taken to another room to be flogged. Sonia instructed her to kneel down with her elbows on the floor and her legs spread apart. Immediately, she felt the leather strands snake through her legs and snap violently against her exposed clit, jolting her nervous system to full alert. The lashes continued to explore that part of her anatomy in painful fashion. Amber did her best to bare the flogging silently, but the intensity of sensations and emotions became almost too much for her, building gradually to an explosive climax. 
It was then, Sonia reversed the flogger in her hand and rubbed her swollen labia with the studded handle. Amber moaned softly, but she never broke her position.

"Does this excite you, slave?"

Amber nodded her head, "Yes, Mistress."

"And are to ready to cum for me?" 

Yes, Mistress."

"Very good. You may cum for me then," Sonia told her, "and show me how good it feels to be whipped and fucked with same instrument."

She pushed the handle into her, and in turn, Amber had her climax and showed her gratitude with her gyrations and breathless moans, then finally a 'thank you, Mistress' when it was all over. 

After her morning meal, Amber was taken to the showers, then to another room where Sonia continued to instruct her on proper slave etiquette:

1. A slave never speaks to anyone unless given permission to do so.

2. Slaves are not allowed to speak among themselves, whether alone or in the company of others, unless it is necessary for one to instruct the other on a specific task. 

3. A slave must always address her owner or trainer as Master or Mistress. All other persons, guests, buyers, handlers, etc. must be addressed as Sir, Ma'am or Madam.

4. When given the order to "Present", the slave immediately must kneel in 'karta' position (hands and knees), then press her forehead to the floor, letting her hair spread out, her buttocks raised high in the air, and arms reaching forward with palms facing down.

There were other positions she had to remember also:

"Nadu - slave kneels to the floor, thighs parted, chest out, head up, eyes lowered, hands on the thighs, palms up . . . 

"Bara - slave lays on her belly, forehead to the floor, wrists crossed behind her back and ankles crossed to make them assessable for binding . . . 

"Collar - kneels at the Master's feet, body leans back, head back, arms raised, wrists crossed above the head, again for binding . . .

"Sula - lays on her back, hands extended from the sides, palms up, legs open . . .

"Whipping - slave kneels with wrists crossed underneath, head touching the floor, exposing the bow of her back for punishment . . ."

Amber never realized there were so many positions, but eventually, Sonia told her, she would learn them all quickly enough, and more importantly, to respond without hesitation, else suffer the whip, or worse.

Later that morning, all of the slave girls, including Amber, were sent outside to work on the grounds. It was rumored that Dark Oak Manor would be hosting a party for a dozen or so prospective buyers, and they had a week to "tidy-up" the place inside and out.ï¿½ 

Leaves were raked, the grass was cut, and hedges trimmed. Everyone worked in silence, but they were in good spirits in feeling the warm sun on their backs again after four days of gray skies and rain. Each girl was given a work tunic to wear, even the newcomers like Amber, who as a rule, had not earned the right to wear clothing yet, butï¿½on this day there would be an exception. The tunic was called a Ta-Teera, or "slave rag", which was really nothing more than a scrap of rep cloth with a hole in its center to be pulled over the head. It was sleeveless, without sides and quite brief with tears here and there to expose even more of the flesh underneath. A length of cord was tied about the waist to mold the tunic to the slave's body and enhance her curves. The cord could also be removed easily for binding.

Since Amber and Livia were the most recent arrivals, they had been given the 
unpleasant and difficult task of cleaning out the stables. 

"All slaves here are fully trained in both pleasure and work," Sonia told them, "so they may serve their new owners in all capacities, that includes tending to the horses and racking out the stalls if necessary."

Len was in charge of the stables and went over their chores -- rake out the stalls, and replace them with new hay, refill the water troughs, etc. He then left the girls alone to do their work. 
Now the weather outside was a mild 78 degrees, but it was at least ten degrees warmer in the stable, and it didn't take long before they were sweating profusely in their tunics. In spite of the heat, Livia seemed very upbeat in being allowed to work without a chaperone, and was especially chatty as they raked out the stalls. Amber too, was enjoying the company after being isolated for so long. She hadn't realized until then, just how much she missed the idle chit-chat she used to have with her friends over lunch or on the phone. She grew to like Livia immensely, but wondered if the woman had forgotten about the "no talking" rule, and twice warned her quietly about this. 

"It's OK," she said, "there are no cameras in here." Nonetheless, Amber listened politely, but kept her mouth shut, just in case. 

Livia was from Munich, Germany, she told Amber (her accent gave this away immediately). She spoke much about her "past life&#8221; &#8211; how she moved to New York to become a model, but found more lucrative opportunities working as an exotic dancer for a high-end strip club called The Diamond Cabaret. She seemed especially proud that Sonia was having her trained to be a Gorean dancer, "which is a hundred times more exciting to watch than any dancing I did in the club."

Amber listened quietly, while admiring how the loose-fitting tunic shifted around her companion's body as she worked. Livia was clearly the most exotic-looking of all the girls she had seen so far. She had a prominent nose, high cheekbones, full lips, and a unique set of large captivating green eyes. Her 5'7" body was sleek and leggy, and the day Amber had first seen her in the nude, she immediately noticed her navel piercing and the spiky tribal tattoo stretched across the left side of her lower pelvis. Whatever a Gorean dancer was, Livia seemed to fit the role perfectly.

She explained to Amber it was the dancers that usually brought in higher prices at the auctions. She described the beauty of Gorean dance, of its sensuousness, and how the woman appeared; the moving of the hips, the belly, indeed the entire body; movements reminiscent of love and need. Whether clothed or unclothed, it could be very exciting, for the viewer and dancer both. 

"I once had a private session with Master Raven. Never before had I felt so turned on when dancing until I performed the Gorean for him, and I could see he was feeling it too. For the first time it seemed like I was in control, and that I had the power to drive any man with mad desire just by dancing for them." 

"You almost make it sound poetic," Amber commented briefly.

"I actually DO write poems," Livia said proudly. I always have, since I was a girl. Master Raven wants me to write one about my experiences here after my training is complete, and when I do, I think I'll write about my dancing. He loves poetry, did you know that?"

Amber shook her head no. She wanted to ask Livia what happened after her dance with Raven, but before she could, Len returned to check on their progress. He remained there in the livery with them while they finished their chores in silence, his dark, weasel eyes staring intently. Twice, Amber looked down at the scrap of rag she wore, outrageously brief, so scandalous, so shameful, fit only for a slave girl. Even when compared to the likes of the man staring at her, she would be looked down upon, as something to merely gawk at, or abuse.

After finishing the livery, Amber and Livia were sent back to the house where Raven was waiting the them, sitting on the porch, in a white wicker chair with a glass of chardonnay in his hand.

"Livia," he ordered, "come here and Present."

Livia quickly approached him and knelt down before his feet, then bent over and stretched her arms in front of her. In doing so, the seam in her tunic opened, baring her flanks, yet she made no effort to cover herself.

"Where you talking to Amber in the livery this morning?"

"Yes Master."

"And were you given permission to talk?"

"No Master, I was not."

"There will be punishment for that later," he said, "now go back to your cell."

"Yes Master, thank you, Sir."

Amber was not amazed to see how deathly pale Livia looked as she turned to enter the house. She knew that any punishment from Raven was not to be taken lightly. He turned his attention to Amber and sat back in his chair, but he said nothing, as if contemplating what to do with her. Amber met his gaze for what seemed to be an endless time until she remembered it was forbidden to look at anyone above the belt, especially Raven. She quickly dropped her gaze and closed her eyes tight, but it was too late. Then she heard him laugh,

"It appears there is a lot of work yet to be done with you," he said in a sinister tone. "Perhaps we should begin right now."


-----------


Inside the house, Sonia poured herself a drink at the bar. She knew Raven was speaking to Amber and Livia outside, and being the head trainer, she should have been with him, but she really wanted no part of it. She was still angry with him for taking Amber away from her, then saddling her with the nearly impossible task of finishing Livia's training within the span of a week to meet some deadline he had promised a client. 

But that wasn&#8217;t the only reason Sonia was angry. Since the first night Amber arrived, Raven hadn&#8217;t so much as touched her, and mostly likely would not again now that his attentions were directed to the girl. Sonia hated him for treating her like some throw-away toy, and hated herself even more for allowing it to happen. In spite of her anger though, she still longed for him. 

Sonia knew their affair was unhealthy and dangerous. The Organization, as it was called, never tolerated such behavior. In her twenty years of working for them, she recalled stories about love triangles that existed between the master, mistress and a slave, and those relationships always lead to the most destructive behavior among the three. In one case, the madam became insanely jealous of the slave/lover and killed her outright. Events like this made the Board of Directors very nervous. 

Of course, Sonia would never do something as stupid and irrational as that, but she could feel the grip on her own emotions loosening. What she needed was to get away from Raven, or perhaps leave Dark Oak Manor for good and go back to working in the field. She enjoyed being a free agent and her own boss, but she also knew that leaving her duties here, even for a short time, would only make the situation worse for her.

For over 40 years The Organization had thrived in the business of training and selling human slaves for one reason -- the strict code of secrecy all members lived by. It was a code that applied to everyone, from the board members, all the way down to the trainers and handlers. If any threat to its security were uncovered, such as a suspected informant, that threat was swiftly handled by simply eliminating all parties involved. This rule also applied to any irrational behavior that might compromise their security. Over the years, there had been several cases where the FBI came dangerously close to uncovering their activities, only to run into a dead end after a suspect or snitch they were working on suddenly disappeared without a trace. So with that in mind, Sonia had no intention of risking such a fate on herself, which meant asking Raven for leave of absence was completely out of the question. 

"Like it not, I'm stuck here," she mumbled softly and poured herself another drink.


-----------


"Remove your tunic," Raven ordered.

Amber untied the belt cord, then pulled the loose garment over her head and handed to him. 

"A slave is owned, and owns nothing," he lectured her, "but the master can allow her to wear clothing, or jewelry if that is his wish. Even this rag I hold is treasured by the slave, because it is a signal of her master's satisfaction. Now tell me, slave, do you deserve to wear this rag?"

"No Sir," Amber stood like a statue before him, naked and sweating in the hot sun with her eyes cast downward.ï¿½ï¿½ 

"That's right," he tossed the tunic aside. "You disobeyed the rules of the house, not only once, but twice - first you spoke to another slave without permission, then you failed to address me properly. For this you will be marked and then you will remain here naked so everyone can see your punishment. Now come with me."

Raven took Amber firmly by the arm and directed her to the wicker chair.

"Stand astride the seat," he ordered, "facing the back of the chair and sit down."

Amber did this by widening her stance with the chair underneath her before taking her seat.

"Reach over the back and grasp the legs as close as you can to the floor."

Draping her arms over the back of the chair, she strained to reach down as far as she could and took of each chair leg. She was now leaning forward with her breasts pressing against the chair back, and her knees spread wide on its seat. 

"Hold that position."

Sitting on the porch next to the house was a long chest that appeared to be used for holding firewood. Raven open the chest and pulled out several coils of hemp rope. He tied Amber's wrists and ankles, then her knees the chair legs beneath her. Another long piece of rope was looped tightly several times around her lower back and the back of the chair. The ropes forced her to arch her upper body sharply forward, crushing her breasts against the wicker, with her thighs still spread wide, and her pert ass tilted slightly upward and invitingly from the seat. 

"You know you have done wrong, don't you?"

"Yes, Sir, I do," Amber's voice was weak.

Raven cradled her chin in one hand and spoke calmly, "and do you accept the punishment you are about to receive?"

"Yes, Sir," Amber searched her memory for the proper response, "I accept whatever punishment you . . . deem fit to inflict on me."

"Very good, slave." 

Amber felt her heart beating hard against her chest. He was teasing her to heighten the moment, and it was working. She knew what was about to happen, and it terrified her, but at the same time she was also getting very aroused by it. Being naked outdoors excited her. Feeling the wicker poking into her soft breasts, against her open thighs, and . . . down there excited her. 

Raven moved around the chair, beyond her line of sight, and then re-appeared. He now held in his hand, a long bamboo rod. 

"Do you know what caning is?"

"No, Sir."

Raven paused a moment for the word to sink in.

"It is a form of punishment used primarily in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Administered to the back or buttocks, it could be very painful, and if the skin was broken, it could leave angry red welts on the body. Sometimes those welts turn to scars that last for life. Having heard this, do you think I've chosen the right punishment for you?"

Amber was suddenly aware of how her ass jutted out behind her in the chair and how vulnerable it was. She began pulling the ropes on her wrists. 

"Answer the question, slave," he circled behind her again.

"Yes, Sir." 

"Say it."

She closed her eyes tight, "You have chosen the right punishment for me, Sir."

&#8220;Very well, then.&#8221;

Amber waited and listened to the sounds of her own breathing, now quickening with a mixture of excitement, anticipation and the fear of what was to come. The wait didn't take long.

Whooooooooosh . . . SNAP!

A split second later she felt the sharp sting of the bamboo rod. Amber had never experienced pain as intense as this before. It burned and felt as though the taut flesh on her ass had split in two. Twice again, the bamboo rod landed across it, shifting from one bare cheek to the other.

Whooooooooosh . . . SNAP!&nbsp; Whooooooooosh . . . SNAP!

She cried out. Her body jerked against the wicker chair, her muscles tensed. She tried to escape the torture by shifting from side to side an inch or two against the ropes, but all that seemed to do was present him with a more tempting target &#8211; not to mention the wicker underneath was driving her crazy.

"Had enough?"

"Y-yes, Sir!"

"You know how to stop this, don't you?"

"Sir how? How can I . . ." 

Whooooooooosh . . . SNAP!

"Aahhhhhh . . . Sir?"

Raven leaned close and slipped his hand between her opened legs.

"Well, well," he teased, "I think you really are enjoying this."

"NO, Sir . . ." she wriggled defiantly, trying to pull her wetted love away from his touch.

"But this tells me different." He plunged two fingers into her, and at the same time struck her again.

"Ahhhhhhhhhh . . . Ohhhhhhh!" 

In spite of the pain and anguish, Amber felt her own body betray her, in the way it trickled wetness down Raven's hand as he worked her with both fingers, moving in and out, stimulating her. 

"So, my pretty slave, this DOES turn you on?" 

"Oh no, Sir, it HURTS!"

Her words however were not entirely sincere as she was now moving her thighs against his hand. Two more fingers slid into her with no effort she was so turned on. 

"Do you realize why you are being punished?" 

"Yes, Sir." 

He stroked her scarred ass with the other hand, his loving touch stimulated the stings, making the pain melt to sensual tingles.

"Address me properly, slave."

"Yes, Master!" 

Raven stopped all of his movements and stepped back.

"See, my slave, how easy it was to stop. All you had to do was call me, 'Master.' Remember that next time."

"Oh yes, Master," Amber said with a breathy whisper. 

He watched as her shoulders slumped and her head dropped against the chair, then a smile crossed his face. 

"You want more, much more," he said, "I can see that because I know you so well. You&#8217;re no different than any slave we bring here. I think you know that by now."

Amber didn't need to be told of this. They DID know her, all too well, even more than she knew herself. Raven and Sonia had tapped into, and exposed a side of her that she never knew existed. It made her feel naked and vulnerable. Amber (the old Amber) wished she could lock it away again and forget, but like an old river dike, plagued with holes and crumbling before her eyes, there was no way she could hold it back. 

Raven left her there, tied to the wicker chair for almost an hour, like a child left alone to think about why she had been punished. She felt the wounds on her poor tush begin to swell and rise. Amber wondered if she would be scarred down there for the rest of her life, as Raven had warned. 

Around the grounds, the daily chores went on as usual. Monique was pushing the hand mower while Marin raked the freshly-cut grass clippings. Amber thought it funny that with all of the cash coming into this place, they couldn't afford a decent mower with a grass catcher. Perhaps Raven preferred it that way. The quiet setting she was observing from the porch wouldn't be so quiet with an electric mower buzzing loudly in the yard. She saw two male peacocks on the grounds, their tail feathers brightly colored in blue and green. They followed Marin as she worked, and poked their beaks through the grass clippings in search of food. Further out toward the drive, Tony was trimming the hedges. A horse whinnied from inside the stable nearby. 

Yes, everything looked serene, except for one part of the picture. Beyond the edge of the woods and just within eyesight, Amber could see Len, having himself a good hump with the pretty Asian slave, Shii Ann. He was on his knees with his trousers pulled down just enough to expose himself. She, on the other hand, was naked, and on all fours with her elbows and knees almost buried in the wet leaves. Her body rocked violently as he plowed into her, his bony thighs slapping against her upturned ass. Her breasts hung down into the weeds like cones, and shook wildly with each thrust. 

All this was happening in the open while everyone worked, yet no one seemed to take notice. The fact that Amber, herself, was the only one watching made her feel a little ashamed, as if she were spying on the couple during a very intimate moment, even though it was all happening in front of her. Twice she turned her eyes away, but each time, felt compelled to look again. She watched as Len withdrew himself, his cock still erect and well-lubricated from Shii Ann&#8217;s pussy, then re-inserted it, this time, into the smaller, tighter hole above it. He placed one hand on her back and forced her head down into the weeds to make the angle of entry more accessible. It took some difficulty, but he managed to slid his member full length into the narrow passage. Again her body jerked and rocked. Len fondled both round cheeks almost lovingly with his hands as he bore into her ass. Shii Ann's moon face was completely hidden by the weeds now, so there was no way of telling if she was enjoying the act, or merely tolerating it.

Amber remembered hearing once, that sometimes the handlers were allowed "a little taste" or perhaps an evening with the girl of their choice. It was also no secret that Len had an interest in Shii Ann, and as a man equally revolting in character as he was in appearance, he would never have won over the affections of such a pretty girl on his own.

She thought of Shane, and wondered what Raven's reaction would be if he had found out what happened two nights ago. Several times, Amber wanted to tell someone about the incident, but then thought the better of it. After all, she might be punished too, or even treated differently, that is, more harshly by the other handlers if they were to find out. Amber was also convinced that she was not the only one Shane had raped, and if the other girls weren't talking, then why should she?

Looking of to the woods again, she saw that Len had finished his hump and was zipping up his trousers. Shii Ann got up from the weeds slowly, and without a word, she threw on her tunic then joined the others in their work, as if nothing had happened. 

Amber remained tied the chair for another twenty minutes or so when a dark green Jaguar drove up to the house. She watched a man emerge from the vehicle and climb the steps to the porch were Raven came out of the house to greet him. The two men shook hands and entered the house without giving Amber much notice. She heard very little of what the men said to each other, other than Raven calling him "Mr. Santos," and then mentioning something about having a drink and waiting from him in the sitting room while "I tend to another matter." 
Ten minutes later, Sonia was finally sent out to untie her. 

"Let's get you down to your cell and put something on these wounds," she said, frowning at the red welts. "I don't think these will scar, but it will hurt awhile. Next time you won't be so lucky." 

Then there was a sound of contempt in her voice. "I will no longer be training you. For now on, you will in the care of Master Raven, so I suggest you keep your mouth shut and listen to everything he says, understood?"ï¿½
 
"Yes, Mistress."

Sonia led Amber by her leash back down to the cellar where the slaves&#8217; quarters were located. As they moved passed each room, Amber noticed Livia's door was shut. Behind it, she heard a snap followed by a muffled whimper, then another snap, and another. Amber knew the sound all too well by now. It was that of something hard, whistling through the air and striking human flesh -- a bamboo rod perhaps. Livia was obviously getting the punishment Raven promised her, and the sounds continued as Sonia and Amber continued down the short hallway until they reached her own room. By then the whimpers behind them had turned to screams.

FBI Headquarters, J. Edgar Hoover Building, Washington, D.C. &#8211; 

Special agent Philip Trask leaned back in his chair to get more comfortable as he opened the computer file on Amber Brkich. His partner, Joe Kelly, was seated at his own desk nearby with his feet up, and glancing at the clock every two minutes or so. It was 6:28 in the evening, and Trask would stay late as usual, but Kelly had a wife two daughters waiting for him at home.

"So how many times have you gone through that file?" Kelly asked.

"More then I can count."

"And do you really expect to find any new leads?"

"Couldn't hurt to take another look."

"But it's getting late," Kelly persisted. "Why don't you knock off and go home for the night. There's nothing there that can't wait until tomorrow, right?"

Trask didn't answer.

The two agents had been working cases together for over five years, which intrigued everyone, because they were about as different as night and day. Trask was the Steve McQueen/Sam Spade type -- out-spoken, a risk taker, and either highly respected or disliked depending on who was asked at the Bureu. Kelly, on the other hand, was more laid-back and somewhat of a slacker, especially when it came to his paperwork. But on the street, everyone could always depend on him for back-up, no matter how dangerous the situation.

"You can go ahead and take off," Trask finally answered, still staring at the computer screen, "I'm just going to take one last look at this file."

"Well, if you say so," Kelly rose from his desk, stretched and grabbed his coat. "How about coming to the house later for a beer?"

"Thanks, but I'm beat. I'll take a rain check on that, though. Say 'hi' to Lindsey and the kids for me."

"Will do."

After his partner left, Trask turned his attention again to the new file:

Amber Joy Brkich
Age: 23
Hometown: Beaver, PN (suburb just north of Pittsburgh)
Occupation: Administrative Assistant . . .

He skimmed the whole 'bio' then scrolled back up to the woman's photo, and smiled briefly at the green-eyed dimpled girl grinning back at him. The girl was very attractive, but not in a flashy way. Trask could imagine this one working for some charitable cause, and with that innocent &#8216;school girl&#8217; look, she could sell just about anything she put her mind to. 

That thought made her story all the more tragic. It was just a few days ago, when she disappeared, vehicle and all, while en route from her sister&#8217;s house in Albany, New York to her current residence near Pittsburgh.

Suddenly, his sight became bleary, as the words on the screen circled and mingled in front of him. Trask leaned back in his chair again, pressing his palms into his tired eyes. He held them there for a while before releasing his hands, then pulled up the next file to search for any comparisons. 

There were a total of six cases so far, all of them female: 

Shii Ann Huang, Age 26, an executive recruiter with a BA from the University of California, Berkeley. 

Livia Choice (obviously a stage name), worked as an exotic dancer in New York.

Jerri Manthey, Age 28, Bartender/Student Actress, Los Angeles . . .

Elisabeth Filarski, Age 23, Footwear Designer, Boston . . .

And finally, Audrey Marie Anderson, the oldest case in their files. She disappeared in Austin, Texas, while grocery shopping almost 2 years ago.

At first glance, one could see no reason to believe these cases could be linked together. For one thing, each disappearance happened in a different part of the U.S., and there were no similarities in the victims' work or social habits. Even their physical descriptions varied. 

But there was one similarity -- in all 6 cases, witnesses remembered seeing a black, unmarked van at the victim&#8217;s residence, parked for hours, sometimes even days before she disappeared. 

That coincided with a report filed over a year ago regarding an informant who told the Bureau about an underground sex slave ring called The Organization. In his statement, he mentioned that &#8220;vans&#8221; were often used to stalk, kidnap, and then transport young women to different locations all across the U.S. where they were auctioned off as slaves. The informant said little about his own involvement with The Organization &#8211; only that he had once attended one of these auctions.

Stories like this were nothing new to the Bureau, for rumors of such activity first began to surface over thirty years ago, but there was never any evidence to bring this case out of the 'dead file'. This &#8220;organization&#8221; as it was loosely called was like a phantom, wrapped in mafia-style secrecy, and the few witnesses that did surface all disappeared mysteriously before the Bureau could bring them in, including the one that had told them about the vans. 

Nonetheless, The deputy director in the Washington Bureau wanted to keep the case open, and assigned it to Trask and Kelly, with instructions to look into it when their workload was light. In other words, "Put it on the back-burner, but keep an eye on it, in case something boils up."

Agent Trask was not one to handle any case half-assed though. He looked into the story about the vans by checking the national database for any unsolved disappearances that involved such a vehicle. He found six cases so far, the most recent one being Amber Brkich, who disappeared only a few days ago. That one happened to come across his desk just by shear luck, when a friend of his in the Pittsburg P.D., who happened to be filling out the report, sent him a copy of the file. 

The van theory was not much to go on, but Trask was convinced these disappearances were linked to the case he and Kelly were assigned to. Unfortunately, without a plate number, there was no way of tracking these vehicles, and that brought them to a dead end, at least for now. 

Trask rubbed his eyes again and sighed.

Just then, Stella, one of the other agents, popped her head in and shook it as she watched him.

"Everyone's leaving, Trask, get out of here," she said.

"You're still here," he replied not looking up.

"Yeah, but I'm leaving right now. Go home."

With that, Stella walked out and Trask couldn't keep the smile from gracing his face. Stella was a petite-looking, twenty-something blonde, but tough as nails. He shut off his computer, then stood up and reached for his keys. As he was rounding his desk and walking out the door the phone rang. He thought about picking up the receiver, but decided to let the machine handle it. 
Like his partner said earlier -- it could wait until tomorrow.

When Monique entered her room, Amber was laying face-down on the cot, her arms and legs strapped to each corner of the bed frame. She had been left unclothed and uncovered to give the fresh wounds from her cropping a chance to breath. Amber thought it would be days before she could even sit down, let alone lie on her back. 

Monique moved quietly to her bed and undid the straps. She was dressed in a long red cape with a high collar.

"Here," she said softly, "put this on and come with me." Draped over one arm was a matching garment.ï¿½
 
She attached the red cape to Amber's collar and draped it over her shoulders. She then guided Amber up the cellar steps. The capes covered their bodies completely, but opened when they walked revealing their naked legs underneath. They climbed the narrow steps out of the cellar. Another rainstorm was passing. Amber could hear it outside as they crossed the foyer and entered 'the grand room', where a fire crackled in the large canopied fireplace. 

Seated in front, were Raven and the man Amber had seen earlier. Both were dressed in silk robes and holding a glass of cognac in one hand. Monique made her walk forward until she was in front of fire so the two men could get a good look at her in the light. They approached her, Raven from behind and the other man off to her right. Two hands parted her cape. She could feel the heat from the fire on her newly bared flesh. The other man moved closer. His hands touched and fondled her breasts, then descended down to the V of her body and penetrated her. The move was so abrupt that Amber drew a breath.

"Nice slit," he commented in an accent that sounded Spanish. "Does she respond?"

"Instantly," Raven answered.

"Good. Let me see the other hole."

&#8220;Be my guest.&#8221;

Blushing at his crude language, Amber was turned around, her cape lifted aside, then forced to bend over.

"I apologize for the marks," Raven explained, "as I mentioned earlier, she had to be disciplined for speaking out of turn."

"It&#8217;s always a nice touch though. Has she been stretched?"

"Only slightly . . . enough to handle YOU, my friend."

Both men laughed. 

Amber felt her face burning from embarrassment as they the other man's hands parted her cheeks to expose her puckered hole, which freshly shaved, was now a smooth as the front of her body.

"Yes, very nice," he commented again. "I think I'll have this one tonight."

Amber was then pushed toward the other man, who was untying his robe. As he leaned back on a chair, the robe fell open. He was tall, lean and dark skinned. His body was hairless, with the exception of his the pubic area.

"Down on your knees," Raven ordered.

Gently, he motioned Amber to kneel on the carpet before the man so that her face was only inches away from him.

"Now take him into your mouth," Raven continued, "and make sure you use that pretty tongue of yours."

Amber brushed her lips against his cock, then parted her lips and drew the muscled organ into her mouth. 

"That's it," Raven praised her, "take all in."

The man's hands found her shoulders, tightening his grip as part of his self-control slipped. Then she felt his fingers become entangled in her long, chestnut hair. Tears streamed down her face each time the swollen member struck the back of her throat, depressing her tongue, and making her gag. Amber remembered very little after that. It was as if her mind had just shut down, refusing to acknowledge what was happening to her. She recalled only fragments - the soft crackle of burning logs in the fire, the rain outside hitting the windowpanes. Suddenly her lover groaned, his body tensed, and before she could pull her mouth away, she felt the warm fluid stream down her throat. His hands held her head still, forcing her to receive the discharge and causing her to feel nauseous. When his hands released her, Amber fell back and almost fainted.

"Very impressive," Raven commented, "for a beginner. Now watch and learn."

He snapped his fingers at Monique and pointed to a glass coffee table nearby.

"Sula-Renata!"

Monique moved to the table and sat down on one edge. She then extended her legs out and hooked her knees around the sides to keep them locked, spreading her round thighs over the glass top. Raven approached her, then removed her cape. Monique sat there nude and motionless while he circled the table, facing her. Amber could hear her own heart pounding in her ears as he parted his robe. Her eyes traced the contours of his lean, rigid body. The scars seemed even more pronounced then she remembered - one just below the left chest, the other, circling around his shoulder. His long cock was already erect and pointing proudly at Monique's lovely face. Her lips parted slowly as she looked up at him, her tongue flicked out to moisten her lower lip. The subtle invitation drew Raven closer to her.ï¿½ï¿½ 

Her gaze dropped to his throbbing muscle, and he shuddered as though she had touched him. Slowly, she lifted both hands to stroke the shaft, examining it as if for the first time. One hand slid down and caressed his balls. Amber's breathing shallowed as she watched Monique bring her mouth closer. She saw her tongue dart out and gently lick the drop of moisture that had gathered at its tip. Raven brought his hands down and almost lovingly ran them through her golden hair. Monique took her time. She let her tongue trace the sensitive ring around his cock-head, flicking, teasing it unbearably until she suddenly sank her mouth over his cock. Raven stiffened and threw back his head with a strangled moan, clutching her shoulders now with his powerful hands. Monique didn't wait for him to recover, but started bobbing her head and swirling her tongue madly against the underside of his cock. Raven's hips started thrusting involuntarily, trying to force as much as possible of himself down her throat. But she wasn't having any of that!ï¿½ She took hold of his hips firmly and held him still.ï¿½ 

Raven may have been her Master, but Monique was in control now. She pulled back and plunged down again and again, her lips squeezing with just the right amount of pressure.ï¿½ Her hands crept around to pull his hips towards her, taking more and more of him in until his entire length slid easily down her throat.ï¿½ His hips found the rhythm, moving with her towards his climax.ï¿½ He threw back his head again, his body arching like a taut bow. A grimace etched itself on his face as he tried to fight the inevitable, then with a groan, every muscle in his rigid body seemed to tense up, followed by the sucking sounds as Monique swallowed his release effortlessly.ï¿½ 

The women were then dismissed. Monique immediately retrieved her cape and guided Amber out of the room while both men settled back into their chairs with drinks in hand. Amber overheard them comment on each girl's technique. Monique, of course, was praised for her efforts, and Amber, while inexperienced, still showed enough promise to draw the other man's interest. As they rounded the corner, Raven and his guest were already debating what price the new girl might fetch at the next auction.

Indoctrintation
by Night Owl


Chapter 13: Hunters

The van seemed innocent enough parked along the street. Half a dozen vehicles were parked there also, and since its windows were tinted, a passer-by wouldn't have noticed the man sitting almost motionless behind the wheel. He was not a resident in that neighborhood, but for over two weeks he had been there on business, and his business was in one particular house across the street. 

The man's name was Jason Clark. He was an obtainer of girls, a slaver, paid by The Organization to find and abduct young, attractive woman. This was the first assignment on his own, but Sonia had trained him well. He knew how to set up a surveillance system and could 'shadow' a target as well as any federal agent. Nonetheless, he was still a little nervous, but it was a nervousness mixed with excitement and anticipation. He watched his quarry intently as she emerged from the house, thinking how much he was going to enjoy this job.

The target was a gorgeous blonde with an athletic figure and a pair of large, ripe melons that, in his opinion, couldn't possibly be her real breasts. She stood on the porch, and scanned the neighborhood. Her eyes didn't even pause at the dark van parked nearby. Then she lifted one leg on the railing and began her usual routine of stretching before her afternoon jog. 

Just like clockwork, Jason smiled. During those two weeks, he learned everything about the girl - when she left for work in the morning, when she came home in the afternoon. He knew she was a health nut, jogging about 10 miles or so four times a week, and taking aerobics classes twice in the evenings. They broke into her house one day, and bugged everything so they could monitor all her conversations. 

As he watched the girl lean forward and stretch each raised leg, he imagined her putting on this show for his benefit. She wore the usual outfit -- a white spandex exercise bra and running shorts cut high and loose around her well-toned thighs. Her long golden hair was now braided in a ponytail. She dropped the other leg and began stretching her upper body. Jason raised the binoculars to get a better look, his eyes focusing on her razor-sharp nipples as they tented through the skin-tight fabric. Someone was going to pay a huge chunk of change for this one, he thought.&nbsp; 

After loosening up, the woman began her jog, heading down the street in the opposite direction. Jason watched her until she turned the corner, then he lifted the mic,

"Target is on the move. Stand-by."

"Roger," a voice answered.

The other two men were waiting in their truck only a few blocks away. Jason estimated the girl would be gone 40 minutes, having timed her a dozen or so times before. When she returned, she would be good and tired from her workout, and less likely to put up much of a struggle. That's when they'd make their move. 

Jason leaned back in his seat and leafed though the file Sonia had given him on the girl: 

Name: Heidi Strobel
Age: 25
Marital Status: Single
Occupation: P.E. Teacher
Residence: 246 Cottonwood Lane, Buffalo, Missouri

The file then went over her bio. Most of it was bullshit, but Sonia was always very thorough in her reports -- Bachelor of Arts degree in exercise physiology, secondary education and physical education from Drury University in Springfield, Missouri. Currently, a physical education and health teacher at Pendleton High School. Previously worked as a sales representative for a lingerie company, a secretary in a doctor's office, etc . . . etc . . .

The high school yearbook photo Sonia included showed a very sexy dish trying to appear official in her white polo shirt with a "Pendleton" logo on the pocket and whistle around her neck. Jason couldn't recall any of his P.E. teachers looking this good, nor even being a woman for that matter -- just ex-marines and washed-up football players with crew cuts and loud voices. 

"Keep those toes on the line!" he remembered hearing them say as the class lined up in their matching gym shorts and jerseys. 

Things certainly had changed since then. He imagined Heidi walking to class, looking very leggy in her shorts, and wearing a white tank top with her whistle dangling between those torpedo-like breasts, drawing heated stares (not to mention a hard-on) from every boy she passed in the halls. Jason remembered seeing girls like that in his high school. Beautiful, 
bratty and bitchy, all of them, and if he were a rich client, he could easily part with a substantial portion of his wealth to own such a girl - to tease, fuck and abuse whenever he wished. 

Forty minutes later, just as Jason had guessed, Heidi came jogging back to the house. He lifted the mic again.

"Target in sight," he said, "let's move."

"We're on our way," answered the other voice.

Less than two minutes later, a delivery truck appeared and pulled up in front of her house. It was actually an old U-Haul truck that had been repainted with a logo that read "Smythe Bros. Furniture" on the sides.&nbsp; 

"It&#8217;s showtime," Jason whispered to himself. He lit a cigarette, then took a draw and waited.


------------------


Dave Roberts emerged from his truck and walked confidently up to the front door, while his partner, Marco Sanchez, stayed in the cab and waited. Both men were wearing delivery uniforms with a Smythe Bros. patch stitched above the front pocket. Heidi was still dressed in her bra top and shorts when she answered the door, her perfectly tanned skin beading with perspiration all over.

"Good afternoon, ma'am," he said, "I'm with Smythe Brothers Furniture. We have your sofa for you?"

"I didn't order a sofa."

"Are you sure?" Dave glanced at the fake form on his clipboard. "This IS the Brooks residence, isn't it?"

"No. Strobel."

"Shit! Oh . . . sorry about my language, ma'am, but we were supposed to get this sofa delivered an hour ago, and now they've given me the wrong address. Do you think you could let me use your phone so I can call the warehouse?"

"Um . . . sure, go ahead," Heidi stepped aside to let him in. "It&#8217;s through the living room in the kitchen."

"Thanks, ma'am. I really do apologize for this."

Dave grabbed the phone and dialed a number, then pretended to talk to his supervisor. Heidi was drying off with a towel. She moved passed him to the sink and poured herself a glass of water. Dave continued his fake conversation, but quietly hung up the phone. He reached into his pocket. The plastic bag opened easily, as he got the chloroform-soaked cloth ready. 

"I've never heard of Smythe Brothers," she said while still facing away from him at the sink. "Where are they locat . . ." 

Heidi's words were cut off as he pounced on her from behind. The glass fell from her hands, spraying water and shattered glass all over the floor. His left arm locked around her ample chest while he used his right hand to cover her face with the cloth. Her initial cry was immediately muffled by the cloth. She struggled frantically, twisting, grabbing at his arms, scratching, kicking.

Her strength surprised him at first. He'd almost forgotten he was dealing with a well-trained athlete. She almost broke his grip a couple of times, but his superior brute strength and the quick action of the chemical soon tamed the wild animal she'd become. Her arms finally fell limp to her sides. Her legs lost their ability to support her weight. He continued to hold her tightly for a minute until he was sure she was really out, then he gently laid her on the floor. Dave stood over his victim breathing heavily. He remained still for several minutes, as though he were expecting the cops to suddenly come bursting into the house with their weapons drawn. But nothing happened. 

As his breathing and heart-rate returned to normal, he proceeded to the front door and waved the signal to his partner. Jason also saw it through the binoculars in his van, and breathed a sigh of relief. 

Together Dave and Marco grabbed a large crate from the back of the truck, and carried it into the house. The crate was empty, save for a few items they would use to bind their captive with. Dave then pulled out the largest item, a straightjacket. As much as he liked to bind his victims with rope, he felt the straightjacket would be more secure for now. He knelt down next to Heidi's prone form and pulled her up. He listened to her breathing and checked her pulse before working her arms into the long sleeves of the restrictive garment, pulling them tightly across her chest and locking them securely in place. 

Next, he took a roll of duct tape and taped her legs together at the ankles and knees. Then he folded her legs up and taped her ankles to her thighs. An air mask was placed over her mouth and secured with leather straps around her head. A small air tank would then be fastened inside the crate with her so she could breath once it was sealed up. Having once been a pre-med student, Dave knew there was a possibility that she could have a reaction to the chloroform which would make things a little messy, and possibly dangerous, but since that had happened only once for as long as he could remember, he decided to risk it.

While Dave did this, Marco cleaned up the spilled water and carefully picked up all of the glass, then put it into a plastic bag to take with them so there would be no evidence of a struggle. It was also his job to remove all camera and listening devices, and to wipe away any fingerprints. Lastly, they carefully lifted their human package into the crate and sealed it up tightly. 

Jason watched from the van while his partners carried the crate from the house and loaded it into the truck. 

"Everything go well?" he spoke into the mic.

"Yeah, no sweat," Dave answered.

"Good, I'll meet you at the rendezvous point. We have a long drive ahead of us."

With that, Jason waited until the truck was out of site, then started up the van and followed.


------------------


Everyone knew Elma Peterson to be a neighborhood gossip. At age 71, and hobbled with a cane, she had little to do all day but watch people from her window, or on nice warm days, from the porch. She knew Bill and Maggie Stevenson were getting a divorce before anyone else, and how Shawna McFarland, that bimbo cheerleader who lived three houses up, had to get an abortion once. Elma got all sorts of tasty bits of information just by watching her neighbors on the porch, or listening to their conversations as they walked past. She also had her friend Norma Watts to trade gossip with over the phone. Sometimes those conversations would last more than two hours.

So when Elma saw the delivery truck parked outside Hiedi's house, she knew something was amiss. She could feel it in her bones. She also noticed a van parked nearby drive off suspiciously right after the truck left, and jotted the license numbers down on a pad she always kept handy for notes. Then, two days later, when she saw the police come to search Heidi's house. Elma immediately got on the phone and called Norma.

"I heard her family filed a missing person's report," her friend told her. "You have to call the police and tell them what you saw." So Elma did.

One week later, the Heidi Strobel file was sent to FBI Headquarters in Washington, D.C., along with Elma Peterson's written account, and two pieces of evidence found in the house that were equally as valuable -- a small listening device carelessly left on one of Heidi's phones, and a single print from Marco's thumb. This was the break Special Agent Phil Trask had been waiting for. Within days, the investigation was moved from the back burner to the front, and the original two agents assigned to it, increased by five, with Trask overseeing all operations.

"Looks like I'll be working late hours again," Joe Kelly lamented.

"Sorry about that, ol' chum," Trask smiled and fired a piece of waded paper over to his partner's desk.

Indoctrintation
by Night Owl

I can feel you
I can feel all of you.
My body begs for more
As my thighs grow sore.
I scream out in ecstasy
Feeling the tightness grow inside of me.
I feel the tightness burst
And it quenches my sexual thirst.

&nbsp;&nbsp; 

Chapter 14: Raven's Grasp

Days passed as Amber continued to lead her new and highly unusual life. After she had demonstrated her oral skills to Raven and Mr. Santos, Shane came to her cell the following night and demanded a demonstration for himself, 
&nbsp;&nbsp; 
"Just wrap your pretty mouth around my cock and suck it down . . ." he told her.
&nbsp;&nbsp; 
No longer were promises made of helping Amber escape in return for her complaisance. By now, they both knew she had no choice in the matter. He always made it clear that if Raven were to find out, Amber would be the one to shoulder the punishment, while he would merely get a slap on the wrist. So that night, she "sucked it down" as she was told.
&nbsp;&nbsp; 
In spite of Shane, life generally became easier for her after those first few days of training. Amber did everything asked of her, and as a reward for her progress, she was allowed to wear some type of garment, usually a work tunic or silk camisk. The Turian, in particular, was commonly worn in the house by all the slave girls. Shaped a bit like an inverted T, it was fastened about the neck with a piece of hemp rope, passed down low in front and drawn tightly up between the legs, with the two sides of the T bars folded around the hips and tied off in front below the belly. It left the back uncovered completely while fitting snugly around the breasts and trunk. Of course, a collar was worn at all times and leather 'roman' sandals were usually permitted to protect their feet whenever they did their chores outside. If a slave needed to be disciplined, her clothing was immediately stripped away, then after her punishment, she would be forced to spend the remainder of the day in the nude with the fresh marks from her whipping visible for everyone to see.
&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Another improvement for Amber was that she could now mingle with the other slave girls, especially during their meals when they all gathered in the mess hall next the kitchen. Talking was permitted at this time, and the girls were usually engaged in quiet conversations among themselves between bites of food.
&nbsp;&nbsp; 
"Conversation is a valuable outlet among slaves," Raven once explained to her. "Sometimes long periods of isolation without any human interaction can lead to mental breakdowns. So we allow this activity at mealtimes, even encourage it, so long as the privilege is not abused."
&nbsp;&nbsp; 
By then, Raven had taken over Amber's training completely, and as each day passed, it became more apparent that this new arrangement was intolerable for Sonia. No angry words were passed, but there was a bitterness in the Head Mistress toward Raven that everyone sensed. Raven must have known too, though if he did, he showed little concern. He continued with the training, spending long hours with Amber and using her in any way he pleased, with only one exception. There was no penetration, and after so many sessions, that was the one thing she longed for the most from him. 
&nbsp;&nbsp; 
One day, for instance, Raven brought her up to one of the large guest rooms on the second floor and told her to strip off her camisk, which she did. On each side of the bed, there were a pair of tall windows that could be seen from the front of the house. Each extended from floor to ceiling, and except for the drapes, which split into stiff folds below the curtain loops that held them apart, there were no coverings. Two heavy-metal rings had been screwed into the ceiling at the corners of one window, and another pair into the polished hardwood floor. Once Amber was naked, he then chained her to these rings, stretching her arms and legs wide so that her body formed the shape of an X in front of the window. The height of her suspension was just enough to keep her standing on her toes. Amber felt sure she was to be whipped - or perhaps it would be his chrome handled riding crop laid across her back. 
&nbsp;&nbsp; 
To her surprise, Raven didn't beat her that time, but left her standing there alone in front of the window for nearly two hours. That afternoon, two men came in a truck carrying four poplar trees. They planted these trees on the grounds in front of the house - one, no more than thirty feet from where she was standing. The window was so tall and the room so bright that all these men had to do, was to simply look up and they would see Amber, naked and stretched in the window frame with her breasts nearly touching the glass. 
&nbsp;&nbsp; 
For an hour, she stood there watching, her heart pumping wild with nervous anticipation as they dug each hole, planted a tree and covered it up again. Much to her relief they had never noticed her, but there was also a feeling of dejection, like a new bride robbed of her wedding night. By the time Raven returned, she would have done anything just to feel him inside her. He stood behind her for a long time, and together, they watched the two men through the window as they packed up their truck and left.
&nbsp;&nbsp; 
"My, my," he said, "if only they knew what they were missing in here!"
&nbsp;&nbsp; 
He then reached down between her legs and pressed one hand up against her heated mound. He held it there for a long time.
&nbsp;&nbsp; 
("Oh, god, don't stop, PLEASE,") her mind was screaming. She tried stretching out to reach him, but Raven took his hand away. 
&nbsp;&nbsp; 
"Sorry, pet," he said, as if he could hear her thoughts. "You're not ready. In time, you will learn how to pleasure a man properly, only then, will you share my bed."&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Those first few days under Raven's tutelage were the most difficult for Amber, because he never touched her, at least in the way she wanted him to. Furthermore no one else was allowed to touch her. Even Shane stayed away for a time. During the long daytime hours, Raven made her wear a leather chastity belt, and at night, she was chained to her bed to keep her hands from touching her own body. 
&nbsp;&nbsp; 
In the meantime, Monique had been assigned to work with her on broadening her sex skills. First there were the oral techniques, which Monique demonstrated by using a penis-shaped dildo. She showed Amber how important it was to use the tongue while 'giving head.' Amber observed carefully, as she rippled and rolled her oral appendage around the fake penis (and that sight, alone, would have given any healthy man an instant hard-on!) She then taught Amber how to place a rolled condom into the mouth and then unroll it onto a man's erect penis without using the hands (another feat Monique demonstrated with ease). But the most important thing Amber had to learn, and what most men took delight in, was how to take in any sized hard-on, shaft and all, and while doing this, massage it with her mouth and tongue. This could only be done by relaxing the jaw and throat muscles, which any woman could learn with a little patience and practice, Monique assured her. 
&nbsp;&nbsp; 
"Remember that movie, 'Fast Times at Ridgemont High', when Phoebe Cates showed her friend how to give a blow job by using a carrot? Well I practiced with a large cucumber, by inserting it just a little further each day, until I could swallow the whole thing without gagging on it!"
&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Another thing Amber had to remember while pleasing a man orally, was rhythm, which was something that varied with each person, and often each session. 
&nbsp;&nbsp; 
"You must always pay attention to the results you are creating," Monique told her, "because some men ejaculate faster than others, and you want to make the experience last as long as possible," she later illustrated this point by demonstrating her skills on Tony, who not surprisingly, was very eager to volunteer his services. 
&nbsp;&nbsp; 
"Now moving to the vagina," she continued, "there are many internal muscle groups surrounding a woman's cunt. It is important that you learn to control the movement of these muscles while having sex to prolong the build-up of an orgasm, and more importantly, massage the man's cock while he was inside you. You can practice these movements by simply contracting the vaginal muscles while lying in bed at night. 
&nbsp;&nbsp; 
"If a subbie puts her mind to it, she can even learn how to use those muscles to make her man cum just from their internal movements," then she smiled, "or even strengthen them to a point where bruises can be left on the penis!"&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp; 
With guidance from Raven and Monique, Amber quickly learned what was expected of her as a slave - how to act, how to address, and how to please any man or woman sexually without hesitation. Already, her old life seemed a distant memory, and for the time being, any thoughts she had of escaping had been forgotten. 
&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Then one day, Amber was having her noon meal with the other girls. It was Livia's turn to prepare the food, which consisted of a bowl of Sa-Tarna with mixed fruit and bread. After serving the others she took her seat with Marin. Both were being trained as Gorean dancers, and they quickly became engaged on the subject, while comparing notes on what each had learned so far. The conversation continued while the other women finished their meals in silence, then after the bowls were taken away, Monique made an announcement,
&nbsp;&nbsp; 
"I heard a new girl was brought in late last night . . ."
&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Livia and Marin immediately broke off their discussion and turned to listen.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&#8220;They&#8217;re keeping her down in the wine cellar."
&nbsp;&nbsp; 
"A new girl? How did you find out?" Shii Ann asked.
&nbsp;&nbsp; 
"Tony," Monique answered in a low voice. "He told me this morning. I guess this one really put up a fight too, so they beat her and put her in isolation. She'll be down there for awhile."
&nbsp;&nbsp; 
"I don't know why they even bother resisting," Marin voiced her opinion. "I mean, it's easier just to let things happen and get it over with, you know?"
&nbsp;&nbsp; 
The others agreed.
&nbsp;&nbsp; 
"What does this girl look like?" It was Shii Ann again.
&nbsp;&nbsp; 
"Blonde, pretty of course. Big tits too, and real . . . according to Tony."
&nbsp;&nbsp; 
"Great," Shii Ann glanced down briefly at her own chest. "I hope I don't have to stand on the block with her."
&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Monique laughed, "Don't worry hon. You'll be sold long before SHE'S ready for auction. I'm sure of it!"
&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Nothing more was mentioned about the new girl, and the other slaves believed as Monique did, that she wouldn't be seen for days.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp; 
----------
&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp; 
That evening, Raven made his way down the narrow winding stairwell to the rooms underneath the cellar. He passed the first room, where a single chain dangled down from the ceiling. This was where Amber had spent her first night in the house. Raven often kept the new arrivals down here. At one time, the whole level had been used as a winery. Unlike most wineries though, with their sprayed concrete providing the interior finish, this one was lined with ancient brick, just as one might find in Roman catacombs or Venetian dungeons. Only one of the rooms served its original purpose, which stored rows and rows of merlots, cabernets, chablis, even champagne - Raven's own private stock. The other rooms remained as they always were, long neglected and decaying with age. Raven wanted it that way. The cool dampness and exposure to the surrounding soil via cracks and holes in the outer walls, not only offered the perfect environment for storing wine, but for breaking in new slaves also. 
&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Raven felt a familiar rush of excitement course through him as he made his way through the honeycombed maze of small rooms and tight corridors. He paused at one door and pulled out a set of keys. A metallic sound pierced the silent gloom as the lock turned. The bolt rattled inside the door like a steel pipe clattering on a marble floor.
&nbsp;&nbsp; 
The prisoner was blindfolded, and hanging by her wrists in the center of the room, her naked body stretched, suspended in mid-air and turning slowly on the twisted steel cord. Raved circled her slowly, taking his time, then he ran his hands up and down her flanks, turning her so that he could appraise her more closely.

"Mmmmmmmmmmph!" She moaned a protest through her gag.

The girl was stunningly attractive, to say the least. She reminded him of those heroines so often objectified in comic magazines -- sleek, long-legged and athletic in appearance, yet still very feminine-looking. Her breasts were not only impressive in size and shape, they stood out gloriously from her ribs, and just slightly fairer than the rest of her tanned body, making them look even more provocative in appearance.
&nbsp;&nbsp; 
He removed the blindfold so he could better see her face -- beautifully sculpted with high well-chiseled cheekbones, dark oval eyes, and a strong jawline. Her long golden hair was tied back neatly into a ponytail.
&nbsp;&nbsp; 
About this time, Shane entered the room. In seeing both men, the girl began to scream, 

"MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMPH!"

They watched in silent admiration as she struggled with the cuffs around her wrists, her supple body twisting and swaying almost rythmically on the cord. 
&nbsp;&nbsp; 
"Feisty, isn't she," Shane offered a comment, but Raven didn't answer. His eyes seemed to dwell for ages on her ample breasts as if he were in a trance, no doubt imagining the tortures that he would inevitably be subjecting them to.
&nbsp;&nbsp; 
The woman finally stopped her struggling and hung silently as her body slowly turned away from them. Even from behind, she seemed in perfect physical shape. Her ass was firm and round. The sides of her body narrowed gradually from her shoulders all way down to her waist, then flared out just slightly around the hips. Her backline was deep and exquisite. At this angle, one would never have imagined the enormous tits hiding on the other side. Her flesh had already been marked with a lash, yet she still appeared undaunted by these previous assaults on her body. She was feisty all right, but Raven knew that would change very soon. He moved in closer and gave her right breast a poke with the silver handle of his riding crop.
&nbsp;&nbsp; 
She screamed again and shifted from side to side, rocking in a more careful attempt to communicate her distress. Of course, this only made her body even more appealing to the greedy, lustful eyes that were watching. Finally, Raven broke his silence.
&nbsp;&nbsp; 
"Now Heidi . . ." he said, "it is Heidi, isn't it? I was planning to release you so we could talk awhile, but if you don't simmer down, then I'm afraid I'll just have to let you hang there for another hour or so. Is that what you want?"
&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Heidi shook her head.
&nbsp;&nbsp; 
"Good. So let's control that temper, OK?"
&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Beads of sweat made her tanned skin glow in the torch light, and already, tiny droplets began to roll lazily down her body. She finally nodded.
&nbsp;&nbsp; 
"Good girl . . . now we can let you down."
&nbsp;&nbsp; 
A large crank was turned, lowering her feet to the floor. Next the cuffs were removed, and finally, the gag. Shane then clipped a leash to the back of her collar. 
&nbsp;&nbsp; 
"There. That feels better, doesn't it?" Raven tried to sound sympathetic.
&nbsp;&nbsp; 
It took awhile for the girl to get used to standing again after hanging for two hours. As she stood, rubbing the circulation back into her arms, her eyes quickly darted toward the door. Shane held her leash tighter, sensing she was about to make a break for it, but Raven only smiled as if amused. His smile then turned into a laugh.
&nbsp;&nbsp; 
"Don't be so foolish. You'll never reach the door with my associate holding your leash, and even if you were able to make a . . . 'clean getaway,' as they say in the movies, I seriously doubt you would get very far without any clothes. Now, I want you kneel for me, on the floor."
&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Heidi didn't run for the door, as she might have been tempted to do, but she didn't kneel either. Her lovely brown eyes seemed to burn with defiance, so Raven wasted no time in bringing the back of his hand down hard across her right cheek. She yelped and stumbled backward with the force of the blow. The spot where his hand made contact began to redden immediately.
&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Very softly, Raven whispered again, "I said, KNEEL."&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp; 
His voice was such a startling contrast to the pain in her cheek, that the girl looked confused for a moment. She still held her ground though.
&nbsp;&nbsp; 
"Ah, so you're a hard ass," Raven pulled the crop out of his belt again as he circled her slowly. "Right now, you must be thinking, 'I would rather DIE than give in to this man.' Well if you expect me to be angry, or even impressed with this rash behavior, then your wrong. 
 
"I can think of nothing that pleases me more than breaking hard asses like yourself. So I HOPE you won&#8217;t give in to me right away. I HOPE it takes weeks to break you, because the more pain you can take, the more variations of that pain I can inflict on you."
&nbsp;&nbsp; 
He struck her again, this time with the crop on her right breast. Before the girl could even react, Shane gave the leash a sharp yank, forcing her down to her knees on the cold, wet floor. She seemed clearly shaken now, her eyes filled with self-doubt. Raven slid the crop back into his belt and went over the house rules,
&nbsp;&nbsp; 
"Instant obedience, of course, is most important . . . No talking unless you are spoken to first . . . If necessary, you may ask for permission to speak, but do not abuse this privilege . . . Affection and enthusiasm are expected of you, and no sexual inhibitions, but no playing with yourself either . . . Proper posture, always look your best . . . No looking a free person in the eye, except when given permission to do so . . . and no use of a free person's name - you call them 'Sir' or Ma'am', and you address your trainers as 'Master' or 'Mistress' unless ordered otherwise . . ."
&nbsp;&nbsp; 
At first, the girl showed little emotion during his speech, but when Raven was finished, she looked up, glared at him with her hard eyes and told him flatly to, "Go FUCK yourself."
&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Again, Raven showed no anger, but simply smiled at her, "Oh, I&#8217;ll have need to do that, pet. Not with YOU here." 
&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Then he turned to Shane, "bring her to the table."
&nbsp;&nbsp; 
She was grabbed by both arms and pulled back up to her feet, but her mouth remained firm, her face showing nothing but sheer determination. While Shane dragged her over, Raven pulled a large box out and opened it. Inside, there were several pieces of dried hemp rope, all wrapped neatly in tight bundles.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp; 
"It's time to face reality. Whether you like it or not, you belong to ME now, and I am truly going to enjoy every minute of our time together until you are finally broken."
&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Heidi struggled with the two men and screamed, "Get your FUCKING hands off me!" as they lifted her onto the large wooden table. She was slapped again, then rolled onto her stomach, crushing her large, melon-like breasts against the hard surface. The girl fought like a wildcat, but she was still weak from her suspension. Raven wrenched her arms together behind her back. The tone of the her screams turned from outrage to desperation. She moaned and twisted her hands futilely, as Raven crossed her wrists behind her, then took one length of rope and tied them both together. Her ankles followed suit, as did her knees and elbows, the latter, having been lashed and pulled so tightly together behind her, that they nearly touched.
&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Heidi managed to utter a few more painful obscenities before the leather harness gag was brought out. She then moaned a soft protest while Raven slowly pushed the shiny red ball between her teeth. He buckled the main strap behind her head, then the smaller strap under her chin, and finally took a third strap, this one in the shape of an inverted Y, up over her head, to the buckle in back. Raven stepped aside for a moment to admire the new look of his struggling captive. The black leather straps flowed geometrically up her cheekbones to the bridge of her upturned nose and between her eyes. She moved her moist lips along the shiny surface of the ball, then bit into it with her teeth. A line of drool fell from her mouth and landed in the table.
&nbsp;&nbsp; 
"Ummmmmpphhhh....Mmmmmppphhhhh!"
&nbsp;&nbsp; 
She was completely helpless. She still struggled, but Shane could hold her down with ease now. His other hand busily explored her body while Raven cinched another length of rope to her bound ankles. The other end of that rope was looped around her wrist ropes and elbow ropes, then drawn tight, pulling her ankles up smartly behind her back. 
&nbsp;&nbsp; 
"UUUUUUMMMMMMMPPPPPPPPPPPPHHHHHHHHHHH!!!"
&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Pitiful moans filled her gag, but Raven kept yanking and tightening the rope, bending, arching her body backward in a cruel hogtie until her ankles and arms were firmly anchored together. He then rolled the girl onto her side.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp; 
More rope was wrapped around her upper body, several times, first above then below her jutting breasts. The poor girl moaned and whined as they manhandled her expertly, rolling her one way, and then the other while the ropes were tightened against her with each pass. After the two bands of rope were tied off, Raven next took some hemp twine and cinched them together at the sides of her breasts and in between to make them bulge outward even more between the ropes. 
&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Finally, he rolled her on her side again and circled a short length of rope several times around her trim stomach, then cinched and knotted another rope at her navel and guided it between her legs. 
&nbsp;&nbsp; 
"Ooooommmmmmppppphhhhhhhh!"&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp; 
A soft groan of tortured ecstasy was elicited past the girl's lips when he pulled that rope tightly and deeply into her freshly-shaved crotch before knotting it off behind her back. Raven paused a moment to rest, and to admire the tight package he had created, running one hand up her sweaty thigh as she writhed helplessly on the table. Her teeth bit slowly again and again into the rubber ball. Her eyes closed, her moans grew softer as she started to lose herself in the sensations of pain and helplessness.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp; 
At this point, one would expect the prisoner to be left alone to deal with her bondage in silence, but Raven was not finished with her yet. The two men carried the table, and the girl, over to where the cable she hung from earlier dangled down above. Raven attached a steel hook to the cable. He ran a long piece of rope through the ropes around the girl's ankles, wrists and breasts, then tied the other end to the hook. As he did this, her eyes opened and closed dreamily as if in her own world, her moist lips sliding across the bright red ball between them.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp; 
"Raise her," Raven ordered.
&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Shane turned the crank. Metallic clicking sounds rang out. Sounds that could be heard all the way up the narrow winding stairs and through the open door to the cellar. The cable tightened through the pulley above, then pulled on the rope on the hook, until her hogtied body was lifted completely off the table. The hemp ropes buried themselves into her heated flesh as the weight of her own body bore down on them. The poor wretch tried to scream, but couldn't force any sounds other than muffled mews from her paralyzed vocal cords.
&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Raven pulled the table out from under her. The crank kept turning until she was about six feet in the air.
&nbsp;&nbsp; 
"UUUUUUUUMMMMMMMMPPPPPPPPPPHHHHHHHHH!!!"
&nbsp;&nbsp; 
The blonde captive moaned and squirmed in the ropes as she slowly revolved before them in her suspended hogtie. Even Raven marveled at how she looked. Her beautifully toned, athletic body was now bent backward into a tight, hanging bundle of naked flesh that was almost teardrop-shaped. The bands of rope tightened around her from the force of her suspension, particularly around the breasts, making them bulge outward like a pair of ripe grapefruit. Her nipples, now engorged and very sensitive stood proud and erect like two twin towers of dark pink flesh. She drooled another moan when Raven pulled on the crotch rope, grating the cord against her clit and vagina. 
&nbsp;&nbsp; 
"UUUUMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM!!!"&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp; 
It only took a matter of moments before the first orgasm ripped through her - the force of it intensified by the fact that her body was bound in such a way that it flowed inward without any means of dissipating through any moving limbs. That was the beauty of a hogtie, particularly a hanging one. She writhed slowly, her movements small, her body straining against the ropes, tensing and relaxing her muscles again and again, making the ropes dig even deeper and deeper.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Defeat writ large on her beautiful face. Raven knew the bitch couldn't last much longer like this. For good measure, he took a pair of steel clamps out of the box and clipped them to her nipples, then attached a small chain with a weight to each clamp, and let them hang down from her swollen buds. Moments later, her body shuddered, tensing within her bonds as another orgasm shook her. After it passed, Raven took his crop and struck her a dozen times. Each blow left a fresh mark on a different place while she slowly turned on the cord.

The suspension only lasted about twenty minutes, but for the girl, it must have been an eternity. Like crashing waves each forced orgasm, about six in all, swept through her lacerated body. Finally, mercifully, she passed out. The session was over for now.
&nbsp;&nbsp; 
They lowered her back down to the table. The clamps and ropes were then carefully removed. Raven carried her himself. Lifting her light body in his arms, he looked down at his captive as her head flopped back, her throat stretched taut. He admired the look the collar gave to her. He took her into the next room, laid her on a dirty cot and strapped her in. He would let her rest until morning. It would take that long for Heidi to gather enough strength for her next ordeal.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp; 
----------
&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Later that night, Amber was getting ready for bed, when Sonia came to her cell.
&nbsp;&nbsp; 
"Come with me," and without another word, the Mistress unlocked the chain from her collar and led hour down the hall. She waited patiently while Amber took her shower, then after toweling off, she instructed the slave to rub herself down with scented oil.
&nbsp;&nbsp; 
"Put this on," the Mistress tossed a silk garment on the table. "Raven requests your presence in his room tonight."
&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Amber suddenly felt nervous. She had never spent the evening with her Master before, and anticipated this to be the night he would finally take her into is bed. She quickly threw on the garment - a clear clingy form of white silk that wrapped like a pareau with a disrobing loop at the left shoulder. As she tightened the cord around her waist, her body was subtly but unmistakably shaken by an involuntary tremor of sensuality. Amber never thought such excitement could be generated by the simple feel of silk against her. It was shear, almost transparent, clinging and betraying.
&nbsp;&nbsp; 
"That's no ordinary silk you're wearing," Sonia told her. "It's called Gorean Pleasure Silk, the softest and finest in the world, milled to reveal a woman most exquisitely and beautifully to a master." She stood behind Amber and gazed at her shadowy features underneath the thin garment. "Raven has taken a liking to you. I'm sure you've realized that by now, but don't fool yourself into thinking it'll last," there was a bitter tone in her voice. "He's had many girls before you, more than you can imagine, and there'll be many more after once he loses interest. Now come."&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Sonia led the way up to the main level, then up the long winding staircase. While they walked, Amber could feel the silk flow and brush wickedly against her nude flesh underneath. It took all the self-discipline she could muster to keep her mind off of it. They moved quietly, reverently down the long hall to Master Raven's room. Sonia knocked three times then without a word, she left Amber alone at the door. Amber waited silently, for quite some time it seemed, before the door opened.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp; 
"Come in," Raven greeted her.
&nbsp;&nbsp; 
As Amber entered the room, the silk dress grazed his leg. Raven smiled and closed the door behind him, then locked it. The room was large and elegant with a dark oak, four-posted bed. She immediately noticed the mirrored ceiling above it.
&nbsp;&nbsp; 
"Darling, sweetheart," he kissed the back of her neck, "do you love me, pet?"
&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Amber, trembling now, was too terrified to notice she had answered, "Yes, Master I love you.&#8221;
&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Raven turned her around and pulled her close, crushing her breasts against his robe. Her eyes fluttered closed as his lips pressed against hers with terrible hunger, his tongue darting into her open mouth. For a moment, Amber struggled against the upwelling of lust, determined to deny herself and her captor the pleasure that threatened to overwhelm her, but the fires that passionate kiss kindled in her healthy young body sent her surging forward against him as he ground his chest against the pliant softness of her breasts. Soon she was kissing him back, her own tongue answering his probes, slithering up against his in a lewd intimate dance. Then he pulled back, and she was left breathless and panting, her chest heaving against the silk in the aftermath of their first kiss.
&nbsp;&nbsp; 
"Now, on your knees," he sat on the edge of the bed. "Show me what you have learned." 
&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Amber knelt down to the carpet and parted the robe like a curtain. His heavy cock was already erect.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp; 
"Say it again: 'I love you.'"
&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Amber repeated, "I love you, Master," with such passion that her lips dared not brush the massive organ in front of her. 
&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Raven placed his hand on her head and tugged her forward with deliberate pressure, wanting to feel her mouth on him. Holding his arousal upright, she ran her nimble tongue around the head, wetting it completely before drawing it into her mouth. Raven watched her head move up and down slowly, then he leaned back onto the bed. As the robe opened, her hands trailed up to feel his bare chest. She began to move her head faster, using her lips and tongue to create more friction in the way Monique showed her, before sucking him hard back into her throat. Reaching between his legs, she caressed his testicles, rolling and squeezing them gently. She strained to hear her lover's moans, handling him carefully with infinite respect, the way she knew pleased him. Never before had Amber felt her mouth so beautiful, and so experienced, once her Master had chosen to thrust himself into it. When he finally came, she received the discharge as a god is received. She felt a warmth burst throughout her own body after she heard him cry out, then as he slid out of her mouth, she sighed at the emptiness, but knew she was there for His pleasure, not hers.
&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Sitting upright again on the bed, Raven looked down at her and gave her a soft smile, "That was a very good beginning, my pet." 
&nbsp;&nbsp; 
"I love you, Sir," she murmured and smiled in return.
&nbsp;&nbsp; 
"I know you do."
&nbsp;&nbsp; 
He guided Amber to her side of the bed where the black silk covers had already been neatly folded back. She saw that leather cuffs had been mounted into the headboard and at the foot of the bed, all open and ready to receive her.&nbsp; Standing behind her, Raven pulled the disrobing loop. Amber shuddered as the silk dress slid off her body. Leaving the garment crumpled in the heap on the floor, she climbed into bed and allowed him to bind her wrists and ankles to the four cuffs. Raven carefully folded the sheets back on her side, past her breasts, past her shallow navel and stopping just above the V of her body. Then he climbed in beside her, and promptly went to sleep.
&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Needless to say, Amber could get no sleep herself that night - not in knowing that he could take her whenever and however he wished, or maybe not at all. She spent hours, staring at her own reflection in the mirror above, her arms pinned and bound to the bedpost, the silk sheets folded back deliberately to leave the upper half of her body exposed. In the darkness her eyes traced the smooth, deep hollows of her armpits, past the gentle swells of her breasts, to her pointed nipples, than past the long, flat plane of her belly to the deliciously wicked silk coverings. Underneath them, her body was burning, like a furnace just stoked to life. Only a foot or so away, her Master slept, the only man who could quench that fire. She said she loved him, and that was true, but she didn't even know what love really was anymore. All she knew was that she needed him, and never wanted to leave his side.
&nbsp;&nbsp; 
A clock was placed conspicuously on the table next to her. The workings of its motor made imperceptible clicks, but she could hear them well in the silence. She watched the minute hand as it patiently began another round in its journey to nowhere. Amber knew he would make love to her, after all, hadn't she proven herself worthy?
&nbsp;&nbsp; 
("How much longer do I have to wait like this?") she thought.
&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Occasionally, Amber tested the restraints and listened to the sounds of twisting leather against her wrists. The soft black bands held firm, keeping her body immobile and bound in a state of erotic denial - a denial of the pleasures of her own touch, and denial of the need she had for any sort of physical relief. For the time being her mind would be her only friend, and the source of her greatest sexual torment. She tried to think of other things. Anything to stop the flood of sensual musings that flooded her consciousness, with each turn of her wrist, and each glance at her reflection above the bed.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Then sleep finally overtook her, but only for a short while until she felt the touch of his hand. At first she thought it was a dream until she opened her eyes and saw him smiling down at her - a small gesture that sent tidal waves of anticipation right through her body. His hand glided its way from her neck, between her breasts, down her belly and under the silk sheets, stopping just above that part of her body that was screaming for attention. He was teasing her again, like so many times before. 
&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Amber's heart began to race. She pulled on the restraints, her fingers clawed out, then retracted into a tight fist. Her hips squirmed against the soft, silk sheets. Her eyes pleaded for more. Raven leaned down to kiss her, then trailed more wet kisses down her neck to her breasts. She felt his lips on her nipples, first one and then the other, followed by the gentle sucking on her protruding flesh.
&nbsp;&nbsp; 
She found herself trying desperately to control her breathing. But the deep, ragged gasps continued, and soon she got frustrated with the ropes that held her prisoner to the bed. Amber longed to squirm and thrash about, to give in to the sensations and let her body react as it should . . . but the ropes denied her this, allowing only her mind to react, only thoughts to thrash about and scream for mercy.
&nbsp;&nbsp; 
She began to moan, softly at first, then louder, as a finger slowly trailed between the slick folds of her womanhood, stroking it, petting it, squeezing and teasing her clit. His kisses turned violent, mauling her breasts with his mouth. Then two fingers slipped inside her, causing her to arch her back sharply. More moans escaped. She began grinding her hips against his hand as he stroked her pussy. Her limbs tensed, relaxed, then grew tense again, until a sheen of sweat covered her body and stained the sheets underneath her. 
&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Suddenly the fingers were snatched away, and she cried out in frustration, still grinding her hips, searching for another touch.
&nbsp;&nbsp; 
"Not yet, pet," he said. "Not yet."
&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Amber closed her eyes and waited for his next touch. She felt the weight of his body on top of her, then she felt the gates of heaven open as his cock slid into her aching womb, her screams silenced only by the sensation of absolute bliss. Raven leaned forward and whispered in her ear.
&nbsp;&nbsp; 
"You must wait."
&nbsp;&nbsp; 
She moaned again as he wasted no time, thrusting deep inside her . . . hard . . . fast . . . again and again until her whole body went limp, taut only with desire and heat. Raven grabbed her tightly by the hair, tilted her head back so that he could plunder her mouth with kisses. 
&nbsp;&nbsp; 
"Stay with me," he whispered to her mesmerized form. And then he was kissing her again.
&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Amber felt herself slipping into a state of animalistic insanity, and all that remained of her very being was an intense hunger for Him . . . and for Him to cum, to take the pleasure that was His to receive.
&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Then just as she felt his cock tense up and throb inside her, Raven leaned forward and whispered those glorious words of permission into her ear. 
&nbsp;&nbsp; 
"You may cum, my pet."
&nbsp;&nbsp; 
The waves if such intensity felt as if they ripped straight through her body. Two became one, and Amber nearly fainted as she felt the warmth of his passion fill her that very core of her body. She screamed, her senses went numb, save for the flood of orgasm that she thought would tear her in two. When it was over, Raven collapsed on top of her, his cock still inside her, his strong arms holding her tight against him. He kissed her neck and shoulders, telling her that she had been "His good girl." For the first time since she met Master Raven, her spirit flew with joy as His words repeated themselves over and over in her mind. 
&nbsp;&nbsp; 
The bindings were loosened, and His fingers trailed along her skin, stroking the muscles that occasionally trembled and shuddered. Then finally, Amber closed her eyes and fell asleep, feeling the strength of love and the devotion of a slave to her Master, and a Master to His slave. At least for the moment, they were the only two people in the world.
&nbsp;&nbsp; 
And they were the world, to each other. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;

Indoctrination
by Night Owl and Gabriele


Chapter 15: The Video

Amber stretched out her shape and untangled herself from the wrinkled silk sheets. She glanced at the clock on the table - 7:00 a.m. Master Raven had long since risen from bed, and in spite of their recent lovemaking, the demons of desire still haunted her, so she spent the early morning tossing and turning, her fingers caressing, trying to re-enact the grace of his touch, even though she knew masturbation was forbidden and that she could be punished for it. After two orgasms, she was hot and sweaty, but more relaxed.

She arched, again, stretching her lithe body out full, then rolled over, gathering the covers up around her and sat up on the edge of the bed. Reaching over, she clicked on the lamp. A small folded note lay on the bed table with one word written across it, 'Pet.'

Amber smiled as she took the note and dragged the tan parchment under her nose, inhaling. Even the aroma from the paper reminded her of him. Unfolding the note, she could feel the tiny hairs rise on her arms. The sight of his script was commanding, penned in long, strong strokes complete with looping circles and fine point edges. 

"I watched while you tossed and turned, marveling at the ease at which you pleasured yourself, even as you slept. Was it me who teased you so greedily in your dreams?

"Of course, you will be disciplined for this . . . but first, towels and soap have been laid out for you to bathe with. Then put on the robe and join me downstairs for breakfast." 

- Raven

Amber quickly got out of bed to run the bathe water. When she lowered herself in the round porcelain tub, the deliciously hot water settled around her. How long had it been since she was pampered with a hot bath? She closed her eyes and spread her legs wide, placing a foot to each side of the tub. Amber rested for ten minutes, wishing it could last all day, then rose from the tub and toweled off.

The robe Master Raven had chosen for her was long and made of green silk brocade with a high Mandarin collar. The opening in front was fastened together with a single gold clasp, allowing the rest of it to flair outward like a V to show off the inner curves of her young breasts. She slipped on the gold heels he also laid out for her and went downstairs.

The house was already brimming with activity in preparation for the party that evening. Floors were mopped, windows cleaned. Shane and Tony barely gave Amber a notice as they carried a long rolled up rug across the foyer to one of the rooms in the new wing of the house.

"Master Raven is waiting for you in the nook," Monique pointed past the kitchen. She was wearing her black French maid outfit with the fish net stocking and impossibly high heels.&nbsp; 

When Amber joined Raven, he was drinking his coffee and reading the paper. 

"Did you enjoy your bath?" He poured her a cup.

"Yes, Master."

"You may call me 'Sir'," he corrected her. "There's no need for any formalities this morning."

"Yes, Sir."

"Cream, sugar?"

"Cream, Sir."

Amber took a sip of the steaming coffee. For the first time in ages, everything seemed normal. She felt like a young wife sharing time with her husband before he went to work. Only the leather collar around her neck reminded her of who she really was.

Shii Ann brought in the two plates and uncovered them. Eggs Benedict. Amber stared for moment at the two halves of English muffin, topped with ham, poached eggs, and lightly covered with hollandaise sauce. 

"You may eat," he said.

Slowly, she consumed the eggs and muffin, trying her best not to eat too fast. Amber thought she would never experience the taste of normal food again and she wanted to relish the moment.

"That robe looks very nice on you."

"Thank you, Sir."

"I assume you have read the note, and know you are to be disciplined and why?"

"Yes, Sir."&nbsp; 

"What we have done these last few days is an exercise in self-control, and I've been very pleased with our results so far, that is, with the exception of that little slip-up you had this morning. I'm curious though, did you really think you could get away with masturbating?"

"No, Sir."

"Just couldn't help yourself?"

"Yes, Sir," her eyes never left her plate, "I'm sorry, Sir."

"I know you are," Raven said with a tone of sympathy. "you still have much to learn, but for now, let's enjoy the morning first." 

"Thank you, Sir," Amber was all too glad to let the subject rest.

When the meal was finished, more coffee was poured, then Shii Ann emerged from the kitchen again holding a plate piled high with toasted cheese triangles. Raven urged her to eat, so Amber picked one and took a bite.

"So," he asked, "are you nervous about the party tonight?"

"I am a bit nervous to tell the truth, Sir," she replied.

"There's really no need to be. At this stage of your training you'll only be required to serve food and drinks. The other girls with do the rest."

Amber wondered what he meant but held her tongue. She figured she would find out soon enough.

"Finish your meal," he told her. "I have a little game planned for you today, perhaps this will be the punishment for not including me in your treat this morning."

They finished their coffee in silence, during that time, her mind raced again with sensual thoughts about Raven, thoughts she couldn't control, even while knowing that her body was about to pay a heavy price for her little slip that morning. She wondered what her punishment would be. She did not have to wait to long to find out. 

"Come with me," he finally rose from the table as the dishes were cleared away. Amber followed him back up to one of the rooms. There, he produced two four foot spreader bars, each with a pair of leather cuffs fastened to the ends. Soon he had her hanging, from a hook in one of the wooden beams above, arms a legs stretched apart, her feet barely touching the carpeted floor. The robe was then opened wide, and since the wall in front of her was covered from floor to ceiling with a large dressing mirror, there was no avoiding her own reflection as she stood there, spread, naked and ready for whatever happened next.

He went to a cabinet and returned with two items. The first was a cat o' nine tails made of tightly braided hemp rope; the second, a black egg-shaped device with soft leather straps resembling a thong bikini. Raven strapped the thong around her body, and not surprisingly, the egg fit snugly into her vagina. From the pocket of his jacket, he produced a small black box with two buttons and a dial on the face.

"That egg strapped to you is a vibrator, controlled by this remote I'm holding," he said, and extended a small antenna from the back of the box. "You won't be able to hold back your orgasms with that little toy inside you, no matter what you do. So for this session only, the rules are going to be different. You don't have to ask permission to cum, you may cum as often as you need."

He pressed the top button and the egg began buzzing insistently between her legs, sending pleasant sensations deep in her lower belly. She then felt the robe being lifted behind her, followed by a hard, painful snap of the cat o' nine tails on her ass. As painful as it was though, it did not take the focus off the vibrator. He struck her again, once, then twice on the upper thigh. This time the pain got through to her and she screamed. He turned the vibe up to medium and the pain melted away. She felt the 'tails' on her breasts and she moaned. Amber desperately needed to cum. He strafed her buttocks again and it almost didn't register, so focused was her mind on the buzzing between her legs. He whipped her harder and got her attention. The tightly braided strands of leather left fiery red marks on her skin. At the same time, the vibrator drove her wild, stimulating her clit beyond endurance, until Amber gave a cry and climaxed. Raven turned the vibe off while the spasms still had her in their grip. When she was spent, he turned the vibe on again, first low, then medium, then full speed. 

For a moment, Amber gazed at the woman facing her in the mirror, her body sweating all over and covered with welts, her breasts heaving with each gasped breath. Amber stared in disbelief, then turned her eyes away.

Again, she felt the harsh sting of the tails on her thighs. Pain mingled with pleasure. He seemed to know when she about to have another orgasm again, for he delivered a particularly vicious stroke across her inner thigh. Just as the pain registered, Amber came again, long and hard. This time he did not turn the vibe off, but left it running so she built up to climax again almost immediately. She felt the strokes of braided leather as she came. 

"P-please Master," she begged, "Stop . . ." 

"We're not finished yet, my pet."

He turned the vibe to low and set down the cat o' nine tails. Amber felt relieved, but only for a moment, before he took his riding crop and laid several strokes across her ass. The searing pain from his crop was even more intense, and enough to distract her mind from the vibrator. Then after the pain sank in, he turned the vibe up full and Amber was immediately on the edge again. The pain felt good mingling with her arousal and she came again with a cry. He left the vibe on and waited until she was in the throws of another orgasm, then laid into her with the crop, this time striking her breasts.

Amber screamed.

He turned the vibe off and gave her a little rest, then turned it back on, slow at first, then medium, then high. This time, however, he did not hit her. He just left her hanging there with the vibe stimulating her clit. Amber felt herself teetering on the brink of another orgasm. Minutes passed, and she became frantic, the stimulation driving to the edge, but just short of enough to offer any release. 

Without thinking, she cried out, "Oh, hit me Master, PLEASE". 

As soon as she felt the sharp pain of the crop across her thighs, release came. Wave after wave of pleasure flowed over her body, even more intense than ever before. Amber was mortified at having begged him for the crop. He, however, seemed very pleased with the result. Satisfied, he first removed the vibrator, then let her down from the hook. He picked her up, kissed her on the lips, and carried her back to his bedroom where he laid her down on the bed. 

Raven kissed her again and said, "Have a rest for a while, I will send someone for you," then left her alone in the room. Amber was still humiliated at having begged him to hit her. She didn't even want to dwell on the implications of that, and tried to push those thoughts out of her mind before falling asleep. 


--------------


Later that same day, Monique came in to wake her. The first guests to the party were expected to arrive in a few hours, and there was still much work to be done. Amber was given a French maid outfit to wear. It was required of all the girls to wear while doing their housecleaning. Her's was a flirty little number -- an off the shoulder 'peasant' top mini dress with white ruffle trim, an apron, headpiece, thigh-high fishnet stockings, and high heels.&nbsp; 

Monique sent Amber upstairs to prepare the rooms. Beds were changed with fresh sheets, furniture dusted. Windows were washed. Dirty linen was brought down to be washed. As Amber moved from room to room down the hall, she happened to pass Raven's den. The room was empty, and the lights off, but the television and DVD player had been left on. A disc was still in the unit and set to Pause. 

Overwhelmed with curiosity, Amber glanced back into the hall to make she was alone, then took the remote and hit the Play button. A title flashed in white letters across the black screen:

Audrey "Marie"_Promo No. 238 
Date: April 10, 20xx
Duration: 48 min.
Stryker Productions, Inc

The first scene faded in -- a lush, green forest intersected by a lonely road. In the distance, a pair of head lights appeared. Drops of rain could be heard gently striking the leaves, and the buzzing sounds of insects springing to life as the lights grew larger and crawled like a beetle along the winding strip of black asphalt. The vehicle, a Cadillac, pulled off to the side and stopped just in the front of the camera. 

The doors opened. Three very dark-skinned black men emerged from the vehicle. Its fourth occupant, a very attractive Caucasian woman, was pulled forcably out the car. She wore a silky white nightgown that was revealing in the way it shifted and clung to her body underneath. Her cries were muffled by the strip of white tape that covered her mouth. Two of the African men took a firm hold of her pale arms and, together, followed the third into the thick brush. The woman struggled to keep up, her body swaying almost drunkenly between them. Claw-like branches tore into her nightgown and scraped her legs. She fell twice, drawing curses from the two men as they grabbed her by the armpits and pulled her back up. 

She was half-carried to a small clearing and thrown to the ground. Holding her face down, the leader pulled out a knife, then slashed and tore at her nightgown until nothing, but shreds of it remained. They turned her over and pinned her down, the wet leaves sticking black to the front of her body. One of them unzipped the fly in his pants and pulled out his thick, dark penis, which to no surprise, was already erect.

"Enjoying the show?" came the voice behind her.

Amber dropped the remote and whirled around to the door where Raven stood. She immediately dropped to her knees when she saw him.

"Sir . . . Master, I'm sorry! I was just . . . just . . ."

"Just what?"

"I . . . I came in to clean the room . . . and . . ."

"You were curious?"

"Yes, Master."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

"Give me the remote."

Amber quickly handed it to him. She was still on her knees, and looking down at the carpet, but she could feel him standing close to her; so close that she could see the glint of his belt buckle from the corner of her eye. 

"Well," he said, "you wanted to watch. Go ahead and look up."

Amber slowly, raised her eyes to the screen.

Each of the three men was taking his turn using the woman while the other two held her down.

"She didn't feel a thing, you know," Raven said, his eyes glued to the screen. "They never feel the anguish of rape, at least not in the traditional sense. A true slave accepts any form of pain for what it is, embraces it. Just look the girl. You can see it in her eyes."

Amber watched closely as the camera zoomed in closer. The woman was moaning behind the gag, her hair matted with sweat against her cheeks. But underneath the contorted expressions on her face, there was something else. It was in her pale green eyes just as Raven had pointed out - the look of a woman, not in pain, but lost in a mindless state of erotic bliss. Raven waited a while; waited for his comments to sink into Amber's memory along with the images flashing across the screen, before he spoke again.

"You may continue with your cleaning, but for now on, my office in off limits. Understood?"

"Yes, Sir," Amber rose to her feet and quickly left the room. 

She gathered the dirty linen and went downstairs. As her nerves calmed, she thought about the woman in the video and what Raven said. At first, Amber wondered why he didn't punish her, then slowly came to realize that he had no reason to. The DVD had been left on so conspicuously in his office, and with the disc loaded inside, not by accident as she thought earlier. He left it that way with the intention that she watch it.&nbsp;

Indoctrination
by Night Owl


Chapter 16: The Smell of Wine and Leather

A black Audi made its way up the long drive and pulled up in front of Dark Oak Manor. Two men and two women emerged from the vehicle. The driver, a tall, well-tanned man in a dark Armani suit handed his keys to the valet. The two women were both dressed in black leather overcoats with hoods that nearly covered their faces. They followed the men closely as the small group headed up the walk path. Raven greeted them at the door, and pleasantries were exchanged between the three men as they entered, with little regard to their female companions. At 7:00 sharp, the first guests of the party had arrived.
 
Upstairs in the dressing room, Raven's girls were getting ready while quizzing each other on the proper etiquette in dealing with visitors. Amber, especially, was taken under Monique's tutelage, since this was the first of many social events that she would be required to attend. As they stood in front of the mirror and applied their make-up, they went over the house rules again, and what was expected of her. 

With the exception of Monique, the slaves were still going through their training, which meant they could be used in any way, short of sexual intercourse. Whippings were permitted, and other forms of BDSM play, though nothing 'heavy'. A trainee might also be asked to demonstrate her oral skills, but permission always had to be sought by the owner first, and sometimes a payment or even an exchange for another slave was arranged. The reason for this was that all trainees were marked for sale, and the overuse of a woman's sex organs might depreciate her value on the block, just as the price of a new car might depreciate after the first mile clicks on the odometer. Of course, it was expected that all trainees have some experience in giving and receiving sex, so exceptions to the rule were often made, but only at the owner's discretion.&nbsp; 
 
For the party, all of the girls, except Amber were required to dress in fetish wear, or 'kink clothing' as it was called. Monique, in particular, looked like a model straight out of an S&amp;M magazine. Her long legs were wrapped in shiny, black leather chaps that left her ass, inner thighs and the leather thong she wore underneath exposed. Even more intriguing was the bra. Held up by two leather straps around the neck and back, a steel underwire served as the basis for the cups, with a 5-spoke cage to keep each breast rigidly in place without covering it. At the center of the cage, a 3/8" diameter hole allowed the nipple to be pulled through, creating an ideal opportunity for clamping. Her long blonde hair was permed, and the heavy make-up on her face added to the 'sexy vamp' look. 
 
Since she was still early in her training, Amber was not allowed to dress like her companions. Instead, she wore a white silk tunic with a disrobing loop at the left shoulder -- similar to the garment she wore for Raven the night before. As a rule, the girl's status as a slave was denoted by the color of her tunic. Slaves in red silk, for instance, were 'pleasure slaves', and could generally be claimed by anyone who desired her usage after bartering with the owner. A 'red silk slave' was considered to be well trained to please in all ways sexual. Amber's status as a 'white silk' was the opposite, though not a virgin, it suggested a lack of experience, or naivety to Gorean culture. By right of ownership, a white silk girl was reserved only for her Master or Mistress. They were generally permitted to serve drinks and food, or for conversation, but sexual use was strictly forbidden by anyone else, unless on some rare occasions, special arrangements were made with the owner. Not surprisingly, Amber was visibly relieved after being told this.
 
After the first guests arrived, Monique quickly took Amber down to the small server's station next to the kitchen and mixed two cocktails.
 
"The tall man is Sir Goodwin Stryker," she told her. "He's a filmmaker, and the two girls belong to him. Abby is the blonde and the other girl with the short brown hair is named Marie. Both of them were trained here. As for the other man, I don't know who he is."&nbsp; 
 
Amber quietly entered the room carrying her tray. Goodwin Stryker was seated with Raven. He was as tall as Monique said, with sharp, well-tanned features and blonde hair combed back neatly on his head. Seated next to him, was the brown-haired woman. From the first second Amber laid eyes on her, she couldn't keep herself from staring, for this was the same girl she saw on the video in Raven's den. Her hair had been cut short since then, but there was no mistaking her identity. 

In the free world, she could easily have been a model -- tall, slender, and somewhat leggy with a swan-like neck. Her face had an oval shape to it, the cheekbones strong, nose straight, and her lips full. Her short, light brown hair was brushed behind the ears to compliment the facial features and graceful neck. The black mini dress she wore had spaghetti straps around the neck, and a very revealing front that plunged deep between her teardrop-shaped breasts, which were obviously naked underneath. 

As Amber set the two drinks down for Raven and his guest, the woman remained motionless on the couch, sitting up straight, her legs uncrossed and pressed closely together from her knees down to the silver stiletto heels she wore. Her arms were at her sides, and slightly parted with her hands resting palms down on the seat cushion, as if posed that way so that anyone walking by could appraise her looks. Amber was captivated with the woman, by her beauty and by recognition of who she was. It finally took the sound of Raven's voice to break the spell, 
 
"Amber," he said, "I want you to meet one of my guests, Sir Goodwin Stryker."

Amber's eyes darted to the two men looking at her. 
 
"Greetings, Master," she got on her knees and bowed to the guest, as Monique instructed her earlier. Stryker nodded his head in return.
 
"And this is his slave," Raven continued, "Lady Audrey, or 'Marie', as we prefer to call her."
 
The woman looked up at Amber only briefly, and then lowered her gaze again. Her eyes were a striking pale green, but there seemed to be nothing behind them -- no character, no strength, no hope. It was the same look she would see in many of the slaves that night, for unlike the girls at Dark Oak Manor, they had been fully indoctrinated, and resigned to their life of servitude.

"I would introduce you to Abby," Raven laughed, "but Sir Ethan is keeping her busy at the moment."&nbsp; 
 
In one corner of the room, and almost hidden in the shadows, Amber was not shocked, but a little surprised to see the blonde girl handcuffed and kneeling in front of Raven's second guest. The zipper was open in his dress pants, her mouth, closed and locked around his stiff member. The seated, slouching man had his head back, his eyes closed. His thrusts were met by her leaning forward as best as she could without the use of her hands, and almost gagging herself on his massive organ. The strappy, leopard skin dress she wore was raised above her hips, baring her naked tush underneath which was streaked with three red marks left by a riding crop the man was holding in one hand. Raven and Stryker casually puffed on their cigars while commenting on the woman's technique. Amber watched uncomfortably, but at the same time, with some interest. At last, the man arched his back and cried out. He grasped the kneeling woman's blonde hair and held himself deep in her throat as she greedily sucked down his discharge. When he was done, he lowered his head to greet Amber with a smile. His eyes were almost as dark as Raven's, and the look behind them gave her a chill.

"I guess the show is over," Raven finally turned to Amber. "You may go now."
 
She lowered her eyes and quietly took the drink tray back to the kitchen.
 
By then, more guests were trickling in through the front door. Lamar Quinn arrived with his slave -- a pretty, athletic-looking blonde named Elisabeth. Carlo Santos was also there and mingling with the other guests and their slaves. 
 
At the server's station, Monique filled goblets of red and white wine, Raven's best stock, while Amber loaded her tray.&nbsp; Marin joined them to help. The sylphlike, but still stunning ex-ballet dancer wore a dress made of silver metal scales called chain mail. The top was wrapped tightly around her small breasts like a tube, and the skirt, draped low around the hips, baring her cheese-slicing clavicles and jutting ribs. Her long dark hair was permed like Monique's, and her upper arms, adorned with silver armlets.
 
In less than one hour, the attendants had grown from just a handful to over 40. Finger foods were served - crispy fried mushrooms, raw baby carrots and celery, chilled shrimp and oysters. There was also music in the air. It was strong and elegant and carried well amongst the laughter and conversations. Patterns began to form in the crowd. Many of the patrons had already broken off into clusters, usually centered on some group or person -- like a show, within a show. 
 
Amber felt dozens of eyes diligently tracking her as she moved around the room to serve the food and wine. Suddenly, it seemed as though the sheer white silk she wore couldn't have been more conspicuous. Of course, she had been naked before strangers many times, but it didn't seem to her that she had been so naked as this. The dress shifted around her body as she moved, betraying every curve and reminding her of how bare-skinned she was underneath. Her nipples tented though the soft, lustrous fiber. Not naked, but more than naked, it seemed. In spite of how it felt, she was grateful for even the wisp of gossamer shielding she was allowed to provide against the imperious appraisals of the crowd, even though the disrobing loop over her left shoulder could be pulled away and the tunic discarded instantly at anyone's whim. 
 
More guests filed in, bringing the number to about 60. One in particular -- a very young, good-looking man -- was being led around naked on a leash by his female companion. His arms were restrained behind his back, his mouth gagged with a leather 'o'-ring. While he was paraded through the house, other women were allowed to inspect his genitals. His body was moderately muscled, well tanned and hairless, save for what he had on his head. His pubic area, in particular had been shaved smooth, and in spite of the size of his member, which was impressive, he looked 'boyish' in appearance.

Throughout the early evening, as Amber dodged guests with her tray, she was able to pick up only bits of conversation, yet not enough to discern any real meaning. The groups continued to swell and flow to the sound of the music. In one group, an attractive woman was relating a tantalizing story to the men prostrated around her, hanging on her every bated breath. In another, a young couple was talking spiritedly about some exploration or another that they had shared, the small crowd of listeners making cooing sounds at the peaks and curves of the tale.
 
Off in the corners, there were several quieter conversations taking place. Men and women talking more intimately about their private lives. Stolen glances were exchanged, and passions lit amongst strangers and lovers alike. Amber found herself drawn to these more intimate moments, listening to the words spoken in the hope of catching some of the intensity there.
 
When she brought a tray of wine into the Grand Room, a particularly large group had gathered near the canopied fireplace. Most of the guests were seated in chairs or lounging on the carpeted floor. The focus of their attention was on the large oak coffee table, and the slender redhead performing a full standing backbend on top of it. She was naked, save for her white leather collar and a pair of clear, open-toe high heels. Balancing herself with just her hands and feet, she remained silent and motionless, as if she were a statue or piece of human artwork. Her long, fiery hair draped down to the tabletop from where her head hung backwards. At the other end of 'the bridge', her pubic area had been shaved clean in typical Gorean fashion, with a lit cigarette now tucked in her smooth cleft. The guests murmured among themselves as they observed. Most of their words were indistinguishable because of the music and loud conversation elsewhere.
 
Amber stood just outside the circle with her tray and watched also, admiring how the woman's limbs and torso flowed through the back-bending arch. Her smallish breasts were drawn tight over her prominent ribs, her coral red nipples, visibly erect. She had a small tattoo of a spider just off her left pelvic bone with a delicate web fanning out from it's abdomen and ending just above the V of her body, as if to draw attention to the smoldering cigarette burning ever closer to her flesh.
 
Scanning the growing flock of onlookers, Amber noticed Master Goodwin seated in his chair. At his feet, the ethereally beautiful, Lady Marie was leaning against the chair with one bare arm draped affectionately across his knees. Only she could have drawn Amber's attention off the magnificent tableau perched on the table in front of them. She felt her gaze trace the lines of Marie's dress where fabric met skin. Her cleavage was a striking cream against the black material, her long legs, bent to the side and together in front, were uncovered nearly up to the hips. 
 
Beneath the silk camisk, Amber felt her own body stir, her emotions clouded with unfamiliarity. She had never been so moved by another woman before. Then her breath caught when Marie's pale green eyes darted to hers. A subtle smile followed, her full lips parted slightly, before she looked away again.
 
As Amber moved through the room to serve the guests, she tried to keep her poker face. She tried to pretend that Marie and the revealing black dress she wore was not a compelling vision; that her gaze did not unnerve her. She willed herself to focus on something else, but her eyes kept betraying her thoughts, shooting furtive glances toward the other woman. So tied up Amber was with her emotions, that she didn't even notice Raven observing her strange behavior until it was too late. When she saw the smile, and the silent laugh on her master's face, she quickly looked away.
 
By then, conversations around the coffee table were beginning to die down as more attention was diverted to the redhead. Still posed in her back-bending bridge, her limbs were just beginning to show signs of fatigue. More noticeably, the cigarette poking out between her open thighs had burned almost all the way down to the end. Amber paused a moment to watch with the other guests. She couldn't bring herself to even glance at Raven or Marie, for fear of being caught again.
 
Five more minutes passed, and the redhead's face was flushed pink from exertion, her mouth open as she struggled to take each breath of air. Sweat glistened off her pale body, bringing to light the smooth musculature throughout, straining to hold the impossible pose. The glowing embers from the cigarette were almost touching her now.
 
Finally, a man stood up from his chair. Presumably this was the girl's owner. He circled the table slowly, then rapped on the hardwood twice with his fist.
 
"That is enough, my lovely pet," he said. "You may go."
 
The woman carefully lowered herself down to the table. She then removed what was left of the cigarette and took a puff before exiting the room. The guests applauded as she left, not by clapping their hands, but in a quieter fashion of snapping their fingers, so as not to disrupt the rest of the party. 
 
"That was splendid," a woman with a British accent raved. "What shall we see next."
 
"I have an idea," Raven spoke up. "AMBER, come here . . . front and center."
 
Amber thought her heart had leaped out of her chest when she heard her name. Dazed, she felt everyone's attention sharpen on her as she moved through the crowd to the center of the room. 
 
"Your eyes have been on Marie all evening," he stated loudly. "Why is that?"
 
Amber glanced over to Marie, their eyes met briefly, then she turned her gaze blankly to the floor. 
 
"I . . . I don't know, Master," she stammered. Her cheeks flushed red and her hands tightened on the empty drink tray she was holding.
 
"I see," Raven paused. "Marie, stand up please."
 
Marie rose to her feet and quickly straightened her dress.
 
Raven turned to Stryker, "With your permission?" 
 
Stryker nodded.
 
"Marie," he continued, "KISS Amber."
 
As the other girl approached, Amber noticed her gem-green eyes no longer had that 'vacant' look, but were filled with a passion that made her own heart beat faster. Marie took away the tray Amber was holding, then brought her hands up and lightly touched her face. Amber closed her eyes. Then they kissed. Their mouths both opened and Amber felt Marie's tongue dart in and dance with hers. That moment, she had forgotten about everyone else in the room. Then Raven's voice broke in again.
 
"Now remove her garment, Marie," he softly ordered, "and from behind please, so we can all see."
 
Marie slowly and very seductively moved around behind Amber, her fingers lightly trailing up her arm to the disrobing loop. The silk cloth she wore suddenly slid down to her feet. Amber was naked now. She could feel dozens of eyes burning trails down the front of her body, searing into her naked pubis, which just that morning, had been shaved by Monique.
 
So much adrenaline coursed through her system that she could hardly keep from trembling. By then, the small group had grown to over twenty - all of them complete strangers. Amber yearned for the proverbial fig leaf -- anything to offer some protection. She felt like a prepubescent girl on merciless display; a working class lass stripped bare before the aristocracy; a submissive waiting for dominants to determine her value. For several terrible moments, she stood there, waiting.
 
"Marie, why don't you touch her breasts . . . from behind, please."
 
Amber closed her eyes tight, but she could still feel their stares, boring into her flesh. She felt Marie's fingers curl around to caress her breasts from behind. Fear suddenly welled up inside, her body shaking visibly now. It wasn't that she wasn't enjoying Marie's attentions, but these feelings she had never experienced before, or even knew existed within her, were being drawn out and put on open display for everyone to observe. She tried to control her fear as Marie tweaked her nipples with her long fingernails, drawing the tightening pink buds out from her breasts. She even tried to smile once, but her act was a pathetic attempt, and she knew it. She felt light-headed, as though she were about to faint. Finally Raven broke in.
 
"Ok Marie, you can stop now," there was a tone of disappointment in his voice. "Amber, take your dress and put it back on . . . then bring out another tray. We have some empty glasses here."
 
After Marie released her, Amber quickly gathered up her tunic. As she left the room, she heard Raven say,
 
"The girl isn't ready yet."
 
&nbsp;&nbsp; 
----------
&nbsp;&nbsp; 

As the evening moved on, the music changed subtly. The tempo slowed and deeper baritones resonated throughout the rooms. The groups began to break down into smaller and smaller numbers. Amber had still been in a daze through it all after what happened with Raven and Marie. Her body was covered in silk again, but it didn't seen to help much. She felt just as naked and vulnerable as she was without it.
 
One by one, the other girls of Dark Oak Manor disappeared, having been 'loaned' out to some of the guests. Monique was first to be chosen, and then the others, until Amber was the only servant left. Abby, one of Goodwin Stryker's girls, and another slave named Shawna were sent to help Amber with the guests. Having once been owned by Raven, Abby still knew her way around the house and quickly took charge of the other two. 
 
When the lights dimmed, candles were lit in their place to incite the right mood. Sparkling champagne was served in tall flute glasses. The soft melodies piped into the room had taken on a haunting refrain, the tempo more even and rhythmic, like a heart beat. Emotions seemed more primal and elusive.
 
In one darkened corner, Amber saw the 'boy slave' again, still naked, and lying on a plush round sofa-couch with two fully-clothed young women who were making sport of him. They had him tied up in such a way so that his arms were pinned behind his back, and with his legs stretched wide over the sides of the chair, baring his smooth genitals. As one of the women stroked and caressed his loins, coaxing him to an erection, the other took a small hand-held leather whip and slapped him on the chest and legs. The two nymphs giggled and switched roles. Both seemed quite skilled in keeping the poor fellow erect so that, gagged and helpless as he was, they could take turns tormenting him at their leisure.
 
Elsewhere, couples and trios began to dance to the eerie music. Amber observed more open displays of affection amongst men and women than she had noticed earlier in the evening. One woman in a see-through fishnet dress was rubbing up against her man, his hands openly exploring her body while the crowd observed. Wherever he touched, he received a satisfying response from his companion. Another man joined in. Both of them stepped in sync to press against the woman and sway with the gyrations of her pelvis. Then each stripped to the waist, and started rubbing their muscled arms and chests against her body. One of the men caressed her arms and coaxed them up above her head while the other moved in from behind to kiss the back of her neck, his hands straying down to her breasts. Other guests, both male and female, moved in to dance, all of them crowding around the woman in fishnet until she was no longer in view.

Meanwhile, the two nymphs on the round sofa were still busily at work with their bound slave, massaging his stiff member and balls with body oils, while kissing him on the neck, chest and thighs. Tears welled up in his eyes and he tried desperately to squirm away from their probing fingers. The movement was answered with a sharp lash from the whip. Unable to stop himself, he once again tried to evade them, and felt another lash. His muffled groans, his wide eyes pleaded for relief, but to no avail. In fact, the women taunted him all the more, both verbally and with their expert hands, stroking and teasing, followed by an abrupt stop, then continuing again by alternating cycles of arousal and frustration. A small crowd of people gathered to watch. The show continued for at least another ten minutes until mercy was finally given. His massive organ began to pump wildly, and the spectators cheered in unison as streams of the white, milky fluid spewed into the air and landed on his chest.

About twelve midnight, the party began to thin out. None of the guests were leaving though, but merely moving to more remote parts of the house. Some went to the rooms upstairs, others down to the 'dungeon' to try out the different racks, cages, whips, floggers and other implements of torture that were left for them. By then, Monique had emerged from the dungeon to rejoin the party. She was somewhat fatigued after a particularly long session with a few guests, but she quickly recovered and resumed to her duties. In spite of all the activity going on around her, Amber still could not get Marie out of her mind. Many times her eyes wandered, searching for her, but neither she, nor Raven were anywhere to be found.

As the party moved to the rooms, so did the servers. Like waitresses, Amber and the other girls went from room to room, taking orders while sessions were in progress. In the newest wing of the house, the 'themed rooms' were made available to guests. There was the Interrogation Room, with its harsh spotlights, two-way mirror, straight-backed subject chair and claustrophobic size, designed to be both physically and psychologically uncomfortable for the victim. The Medical Suite housed two separate bays, each with a stainless steel OB/GYN exam table, well-equipped crash cart, and outlets for violet wands, electric probes, and other high-tech toys. 

In another room, Shii Ann was playing the part of the Asian schoolgirl being punished by her 'headmaster'. She was ordered to bend over his desk so he could lift the plaid skirt up and give her white pantied tush good paddling. Next he had her lie face-up on the desk. Her arms and legs were bent over the sides and bound with rope. More punishment was then administered with a wooden ruler to various parts of her body. Each time, a piece of clothing was removed to expose more of her flesh, followed by jerks, flinches and vocalizations as the defenseless girl was tormented again and again.

The newly renovated themed rooms drew high praise from guests, but the dungeon downstairs was still an over-all favorite, and the center of much activity throughout the night. Descending the narrow steps for the first time with her drink tray, Amber was greeted with sounds of thuds and stinging lashes, moans and screams from every room and corridor.

There were at least two caning sessions in progress, one of them involving the lovely slave, Elisabeth. Having arrived at the party in care of Lamar Quinn, she was bartered away for the evening to a young couple, which now had her straddling a wooden carpenter's horse called The Pony. Her legs were bent forward and fastened to each side of the padded leather spine, her arms stretched high and locked in leather cuffs that dangled down from the ceiling by a chain. For the caning, a long, jointed bamboo rod was used, soaked in water beforehand to prevent it from splitting. The tension of the chain kept Elisabeth's upper body bent forward, offering her swaying breasts and pert, upturned ass as prime targets for the punishment, which lasted almost an hour.
 
Other pieces of furniture, like the infamous St. Augustine's Cross were also put to good use. Its design and purpose was simple -- a pair of 4 x 4s, crossed and mounted to one wall, with leather cuffs on each end for binding the slave in a spread-eagle position. The latest victim, a pretty brunette, whom Amber knew as Kate, was tortured by at least five different mistresses throughout the whole night.

Great amounts of wine, champagne and mixed cocktails were consumed, which kept Shane and the other handlers busy, since it was their job to oversee the sessions and make sure nothing got out of hand. In the dungeon, both Amber and Shawna took shifts in serving the guests. They often met on the stairs -- one descending with a full drink tray, while the other raced up to fill another order. 

In the dungeon's largest room (the same room where Amber witnessed Jerri's whipping), a very large group of people had gathered for some form of entertainment that was just about to begin. It was here that she finally found Raven and Marie. Both were sitting very close to each other, his hand caressing her bare thigh through the open slit in her dress. A tinge of jealousy swept through Amber when she saw them. There was no denying now, her attraction to Marie, and a sense of bitter rejection in seeing her Master's attentions focused on another slave. 

The upcoming performance was rumored to be a highlight of the evening, but no one, other than Raven himself, seemed to know what it would be. Layers of animal pelts sewn tightly together had been laid out on the floor with the guests seated on padded cushions around it. At the center of the stage, a long wooden post was secured to the floor and ceiling. Torches flickered on the walls to imbue the right setting and mood.

After a long wait, Raven finally stood up and clapped his hands twice, "Bring in the dancer," he ordered.

The guests grew silent. All eyes turned to the back of the room as a woman appeared through a darkened doorway. She wore Gorean dancing silk, wrapped strategically around parts of her body -- just enough for modesty. 

Amber immediately recognized the girl as she moved into the torchlight. A veil covered much of her face, but there was no mistaking her large, captivating green eyes and the pointed tribal tattoo on her lower left hip. The dancer about to perform for Raven and his guests was Livia.

Chapter 17: Slave Dance

Livia seemed to take little notice in the crowd as she strode, nearly naked, to the stage that had been prepared for her with animal skins. Wrapped around her firm, jutting breasts was a piece of silk. It was scarlet, diaphanous in color. A gold cord hung noticeably low upon her bared hips, with a long swath of matching silk flowing between her legs in front and in back to cover more intimate parts of her body. There were small, gold bells, thronged loosely around her hips, wrists and ankles, and golden armlets in the shapes of snakes coiled high around her upper arms. On the thumb and first finger of both her left and right hand were golden finger cymbals. 

The tall, willowy German beauty and former New York stripper paused at the edge of the circle, then assumed the 'karta' position of obedience. Dropping to her knees, she spread them wide and bent downward, arms stretched forward until her nose was nearly touching the floor. The move was symbolic, for according to Gorean culture, it was demanded of every slave to assume this position at the doorway of any tavern, inn, or house, as a show of respect and honor to the place she was about to enter.

Music drifted into the room -- the recorded beat of a tabor drum, slow at first, like a heartbeat. Livia lifted herself slowly to the rhythm and stepped into the circle. She began swaying her hips in perfect time with the tabor beats, her arms raised high above her head, hands together, palms facing outward. There was a clear note of the finger cymbals, sharp, delicate, bright, and then she danced. The drumbeats grew faster. They were joined by rattles and the fifing of whistles. Livia threw her hand back and twirled her body. The silk trains between her legs flowed and lifted with her movements, teasing the audience with glimpses of the treasures hidden underneath. 

Having once performed as an exotic dancer, Livia knew how to manipulate a crowd. She clapped the cymbals above her head and rocked her hips to the barbaric cadence set by the music. Her taut stomach oscillated and rippled in a snake-like motion, drawing attention to her toned muscles, and to the glinting gold metal ring pierced into her shallow navel. 

Like the rest of the audience, Amber watched in amazement with the empty drink tray still in her hands. She saw a wildness in Livia's emerald eyes between her thick, dark lashes. The slightly prominent nose and stubbornly set, narrow chin with high cheekbones, all framed by a thick mane of shoulder-length blonde hair gave her face a distinctly vulpine shape. Under the thin veil, her full, deep-red lips seemed perpetually curved into a sly smile.

She danced before Raven for several minutes, the scarlet dancing silk swishing between her legs in the torchlight, her bare feet, with their belled ankles, striking softly on the fur carpet.

"Here, slut. Over here!" came shouts from the crowd. 

Turning away from Raven, Livia answered their pleas. With bold moves, she approached each of the leering, jeering men, hips swaying, the bells clashing on her ankles and wrists. The men reached out for her, and each time, she drew back and whirled away from them. She picked one admirer after another out of the audience and performed as if her beauty and dance were meant solely for him.

She entered into a series of spins. Her gaze focused to the last moment on a spot across the room from her, and then, suddenly, on each spin, her head snapped about, and she again found the focus. When the music ended abruptly, she finished the last spin and froze, hands held high over her head, stomach in, chest heaving, right leg flexed and extended with her toes only touching the floor. She held the pose for a long moment, her pursed lips panting behind the thin veil. 

From the back of the room, there was a crack of a whip, so loud, it made some in the audience, including Amber, jump. Livia shielded her eyes and turned away from the sound. The music resumed. The drum was now very heady, swift, the whistles shrill and high. The frightened girl moved around the circle, seeking escape but finding none. She tried to hide behind the wooden post. The whip cracked again. Livia threw herself down to the floor and she moved as though her body were being struck by the imaginary whip. Lying on her back, she jerked, twisted and writhed on the furs, drawing up her legs, putting her hands before her face to fend off the blows, her face, a mask of pain and fear. She rolled on her belly and crawled to Raven. She sank in abject misery at his feet and performed the ceremony of submission, kneeling, lowering the head and extending the arms, wrists crossed, as if ready to be clapped in slave bracelets or bound with rope.

Raven produced a collar made of shiny chrome metal and locked it around her throat. He pulled the veil away from her face, then grasped the disrobing clip that held the silk around her breasts. Suddenly, Livia stood up and spun away, the silk unraveling off her body as she turned until her breasts were freed. Standing naked, save for the narrow rectangle of silk that hung low between her legs, she began to dance again, only this time, the mood was different. 

In the first part of the dance, Livia had power over her audience, as her movements flamed the desires of the men who watched. Now, she was no longer a free woman, but a slave, and in her dance, she became reluctant and fearful, terrified of the reality in which she found herself, but knowing she must respond to the sensuous rhythms of music or else suffer the whip. 

The crowd grew more excited in seeing the spirited dancer finally subdued. Her newly bared tits jiggled, heaved and bounced off her prominent ribs. Both nipples were pierced with gold rings to match the jewelry in her navel. Her style of dress, or lack there of, along with her dance, expressed the depths and profundities of her female nature in its most primal form -- that of dominance and submission. As the dance continued, fear and anxiety melted away, and she signified, by expression and movement, her curiosity and fascination with her newfound sexuality. 

Her whole body seemed to come alive in the swirl of music, and then, whipping her long hair wildly about, she danced unabashedly as an acknowledged, aroused slave, much as she had done before, taunting her audience, teasing them, delighting in her power . . . but then, suddenly, as though sensing her ultimate helplessness, and her inability to achieve total fulfillment without a master, she began dancing as a slave in a desperate search for the man who would give meaning to the new-found passions within her.

Another crack of the whip sounded, and Livia fell to her knees. She threw her head back and cried out. The music now became a moan of surrender. She retreated back to the wooden post like a frightened animal. The whip cracked again and she knelt behind the dark, smooth post, facing it, her knees on either side of it, her belly and breasts pressed against it. Grasping it with her hands, she kissed it humbly. She danced and caressed the post as if it were her master. A third crack of the whip and she stood up, twirled around the post and put her back against it. She raised her arms high and laced her fingers around it. The music now became a moan of surrender. Her hips moved more slowly, seemingly in isolation from the rest of her body. At the moment she writhed on the 'slave pole', it was difficult to believe she was not bound to it, even though there were no restraints. She moved, undulating, swaying, sometimes yielding to it in ecstasy, sometimes fighting it, but the pole always held her in perfect place. An incredible, voluptuous tension was generated, visible in the dancer's body, and kinetically felt by those who watched. Amber heard men, and women around the circle cry out with pleasure. The whip snapped again, and Livia moaned, her breasts heaved, her body squirmed as though in searing agony. Still she remained impaled upon the slave pole as its captive.

At that moment, Raven stood up and clapped his hands twice. The music stopped and Livia fell to her knees. 

"Lesha," he barked.

She sat up, leaned back on her heels and lifted her narrow chin upward, turning her head slightly to the left. She placed her wrists behind her back. Raven approached her, touched the chrome handle of his crop underneath her chin. 

"Now that you've all had a taste," he turned to the crowd, "what am I bid for ONE night with this beast?"

"Five hundred!" a shout rang out.

"Five hundred?" Raven laughed. "For such a fine piece of female flesh? Don't insult me. Do I hear a thousand?"

"One thousand!"

 The crowd started to cheer and shout out more figures - "Fifteen Hundred," "Two Thousand," "Three," "Four." 

"Five thousand!" Lamar Quinn offered the final bid.

"Going Once . . . Twice . . . SOLD to Sir Lamar Quinn for five thousand!"

Raven congratulated his friend, and the music began again. 

With a flash of the finger cymbals, Livia danced again. This time, she feigned indifference to the presence of the audience, and centered her attentions on her new Master. She fell to the floor before him, her breath hot and quick, her eyes blazing with desire. Through gestures, smiles, and by displaying herself, she manifested her readiness, her service of him, her willingness, and her receptivity. But her new Master did nothing to acknowledge her presence. He did not seize her by the collar, or by the wrist or hair. As the music continued to play, it became clear to her that it was, by no means, a foregone conclusion that he would find her of interest, or that he would see fit to satisfy her. She had to strive to be pleasing, to show him that she was good enough to be chained. She would have to earn her rape.

Livia returned to her feet, dancing desperately and pleadingly. She dropped to the floor again, and there, on her knees, and her sides, and her belly and back, continued her dance - swaying, rolling, twisting, begging. Curves glistened with balmy sweat as she arched her back, pushing her naked breasts and belly upward. Other men cried out with pleasure. She splayed her legs wide before her Master, and thrust her hips up to Him, the shimmering silk in her gold thong swaying between her milky thighs. 

As the music neared its climax, the man Livia was dancing to reached forward and snatched the strip of clothing away. She moaned as if in the deep throws of orgasm. Her hips began to pump wildly, her shorn sex now exposed and noticeably aroused. Throwing herself forward at his feet, she placed a loving kiss to each boot, full lips lingering before her face turned, a soft cheek nuzzling the black leather. Finally, Lamar Quinn clipped a chain to her collar, and the music stopped. The dance was over.

&nbsp;&nbsp; 
----------
&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Carlo Santos was sitting next to Raven during Livia's performance, and many times caught him staring across the circle at the white silk girl serving drinks. At first he found his friend's distraction amusing, but then he became concerned. It was not unlike Raven to single out a girl for his own usage during her training, but in the past few days, Santos had never seen him so distracted by one woman before. She certainly was intriguing to look at. Her alluring green eyes, long silky chestnut hair, and sexy 'girl next door' appearance could drive any man into an obsession. She also had a very skillful mouth, Santos remembered.

"The new girl, Amber, is a pretty thing, isn't she?" he commented.

Raven broke his stare as if awakening from a daze, "Yes, she is."

Santos laughed, "You can&#8217;t hide this from me. You&#8217;re smitten." 

"Nonsense. She's only a slave."

"But some of them, become love slaves. You know how it is."

(In Gorean culture, the term was often used in reference to slave girls who had found, as it was said, their one true love master.)

"I have no use for a love slave," Raven scoffed. "She's being used only to serve, and to beat and abuse, if it pleases me."

"And do you beat her often?"

"As often as I like."

"But they say the treatment of a love slave can be the harshest, because the man who cares for her fears that his emotions will make him weak." 

Raven smiled. He knew Santos was trying to provoke him into admitting something that simply wasn't true.

"You're fishing with an empty hook, my friend," he joked.

"But still," Santos pressed, "your attention has been on this servant, and not the dance . . . and should I also remind you of the beautiful and very willing piece of flesh sitting just to your left."

Marie heard much of the conversation between the two men beside her, but her face remained expressionless. She was ready to serve Raven, that was true, having been 'loaned out' to him for the evening by her own Master, yet she too, noticed Amber during the performance, and like Raven, she was taken by her.

Raven finally relented. He knew Santos well, and that his closest friend would not back away from the subject until he gave him some measure of victory.

"OK, I admit the new girl has been in my thoughts lately. It's strange feeling too. The first time I took her in my arms, she was in some way piteously helpless."

"But isn't any slave piteously helpless in the arms of her master?" Santos asked.

"Yes," Raven shrugged, "but somehow, she seems different from the others."

"Perhaps she thinks of you as her love master."

"She felt good in my hands. That's all that matters to me." 

The dance was reaching its climax, but Raven's attention was focused again on Amber. His dark eyes seemed to soften as he spoke of her. 

"Do you plan to sell her?" Santos asked.

"I haven't decided yet."

"Be strong, my friend."

"I always am," Raven assured him.

Carlo Santos did not doubt his word. Raven was one of the hardest of men, and the white silk girl, though alluring as she was, had found a strong, uncompromising master.

&nbsp;&nbsp; 
----------
&nbsp;&nbsp; 

By 2:00 a.m., Amber's head was spinning. There was so much debauchery going on all around her, acts of eroticism that were beyond anything her imagination could conger up on its own. All of the rooms in the house seemed to be occupied. Down in the dungeon, every piece of bondage furniture was filled with naked bodies of every type being tortured and violated, some screaming in agony, others writhing with passionate release. Most of the victims were female, wearing nothing, or clad in sarongs, sexy lingerie, or &#8216;kink&#8217; clothing. There were also a few male guests eager to switch roles with their female companions. 

Amber saw this in one of the rooms, where a tall 'vamp' with black hair and equally dark eyes was about to demonstrate her skills on discipline to a small group of mostly female guests. Since there was a limited supply of "kajiri", or male slaves, on hand for that evening, one of men graciously volunteered fill the role. First, he was quickly and unceremoniously stripped of all his clothing, then suspended upside down with chains so that his limbs were stretched wide to expose every inch of male flesh. A rubber ball gag was forced into his mouth to complete the bondage. His new mistress then took her time, messaging oil into his well-toned muscles and teasing his naked male parts without actually touching them. As the victim hung there, spread-eagled and semi-aroused, she took a stiff leather horsewhip, and circled around to take her position behind him. The first searing blow across the man's buttocks sent his body lurching forward, eliciting tinkling laughter from the chains, followed by a muffled, high-pitched scream. A total of twelve counts were administered, all to his muscled glutes and within inches of each other. The other women seemed delighted with the way he squirmed, bucked and shrieked, but the mistress wanted more, so she removed the gag from his mouth and laid more painful lashes, this time across his chest, his thighs, and finally his genitals. 

In another part of the dungeon, Shawna was no longer serving drinks, but given a good working over by one of the guests. The man was perhaps forty, with a neatly trimmed Van Dyke beard. He had the pretty slave hanging by one arm from a chain and pulley assembly overhead, nearly bringing her to her toes, with the other arm tied behind her back. More ropes were wrapped tightly around her breasts, making them swell like ripened melons. A spreader bar kept her legs apart, so all Shawna could do was squirm helplessly as he teased her with dildos, vibrators and other toys. As the scene progressed, her struggling became more and more violent, so 'Van Dyke' unclipped the spreader bar from her feet and bent each leg back, then tied her ankles together with more rope around her lower belly to immobilize her. She now hung there by just the one arm, nearly pulling the delicate limb right out of its socket while the session continued with a flogger, then a bamboo cane, and so on.

It seemed that every slave in the house was being used or tortured in some way. Some of what Amber witnessed frightened her so much that she could barely watch. Regardless, she still wanted desperately to be a part it, but she was a white silk girl, and deemed off-limits until Master Raven said otherwise. She wondered where he could be, and if Marie was with him. Were they in his bed? The same bed she had slept in herself the night before? Driven by an impulse Amber couldn't control, she went up the long winding staircase to the master bedroom. Without even thinking, she knocked on the door and entered.

The lights were out, but there was moonlight shining in from one open window. A breeze blew softly through the curtains, pointing to the room's two occupants. Amber squinted into the darkness, and then nearly fell back against the door when she saw them. 

Bathed in the dim light, sat Raven on a plain wooden chair with Marie straddled on top of him. Both of them were naked, their bodies slick with sweat from their lovemaking. Amber stood motionless in the doorway and watched with a heavy heart as the couple writhed and rocked passionately against each other, both of which seemed unaware as yet of her presence. She watched as Marie sat back and inclined her head, while Raven trailed wet kisses down her long, swan-like neck. 

It was then, his dark eyes darted up and met with Amber's eyes. There was little reaction from him, just a sly smile. He stopped kissing Marie's neck and placed one hand behind her back, then gave her a gentle push with the other. Slowly, Marie leaned backward, allowing his hand to guide her, while relying totally on the other hand for support. In an amazing display of flexibility, she arched her body sharply backward and raised her arms, stretching them down to the floor until her hands found the carpet. Even Raven was astounded by the move. He was still inside her, her legs locked around his hips and the chair. Planting her hands palms down on the floor, she began grinding her hips again. Her green eyes fluttered and rolled white, as if she were in a trance. Raven reached down to her breasts with his free hand and encouraged her further with tender, loving caresses, but his attention was still on Amber.

"I'd let you join us, pet," he whispered a smile, 'but it's like I said earlier . . . you're just not ready!"

Amber said nothing, but like a spurned lover, she backed out of the room with tears in her eyes and closed the door behind her.

Chapter 18: Shane

The party finally ended just before sun-up, and by then, Shane Randol was feeling restless. He had been busy all night keeping an eye on the guests and overseeing their sessions. It was a thankless job, but necessary, for in the BDSM culture, there were always risks, particularly at social gatherings like this one, when alcohol was served and emotions usually ran high. If unsupervised, an overzealous Dom might get carried away while punishing a sub, or the restraints may not be administered properly, resulting in injury, or even death.

Slaves were the most vulnerable too. Unlike other submissives, they were not allowed to use safe words, putting them completely at the mercy of the people using them, so it was the handler's job to act as a referee and make sure all house rules were followed to protect the owners' investments. When a party was over, the handlers might be awarded with a slave of their own for a couple of hours, but Raven wasn't feeling particularly generous that evening. When the last session was over, Shane knew he would be hard-up and itching for a taste, and he wasn't content to merely jerking off in his room afterword -- not with so many warm female bodies in the house to choose from.

Early in the evening, he kept his eyes open for opportunities, and quickly realized this was going to be more difficult than he thought. The house was filled with guests, and that kept the slave girls busy throughout the whole night. Ironically, it was Raven himself, that supplied Shane with a woman he needed and a place to be alone with her.

"I have the new girl hanging in the wine cellar," he said. "At 3:00 sharp, I want you to go down and release her, then take her to her sleeping quarters. Make sure she's restrained to the bed and the door locked, understood?"

"Yes, sir," Shane tried to keep the smile off his face.

The new trainees were always the easiest to con into giving him what he wanted, and though Heidi was a feisty one, he knew exactly what to say to her.

Throughout the evening, Shane bided his time, and played the role of referee through at least a dozen sessions. He hated this part of the job for many reasons -- the long hours without a break, and having to deal with guests who had been drinking too much, but mostly because he hated it because it reminded him of an incident that occurred during a party like this, and of the girl who was killed because of it. 

&nbsp;&nbsp; 
---------------
&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Her name was Colleen Haskell. It was two years ago, but Shane still remembered everything about this girl - her name, what she looked like, the sound of her voice, everything, because she was first and only slave he ever cared about. He was still new to the Organization, having gone through the background checks and a year-long probationary period, when Sonia recruited him to go down with her to Miami Beach to pick up a new girl being held in one of their safe houses. Colleen was 22 then, a 5'5" college beauty who previously graduated from an all-girls' catholic school. She had a pretty face, very nice body and a general girl next door quality in her appearance. Girls like that were in high demand, and could steal your heart if you let them. 

At Dark Oak Manor, Shane assisted Raven with her training, and in that time, grew very fond of her. On three occasions, he was allowed 'use' of Colleen, and after each time, his feelings for her became stronger. After that, he stopped asking for permission, and occasionally they would sneak away to another part of the house, or to the stables so they could be alone. 

After seven weeks of training, Colleen was fully indoctrinated and ready to be sold. By then, Shane had completely fallen for her. Now it could be argued that she didn't feel the same for him, at least in a traditionally sense, but as a slave, Colleen became just as devoted to him as any sub was devoted to her master. She knew Shane would take care of her, and for Shane, that was enough. He wanted to buy off Colleen for himself before she went to auction, but on a handler's pay, it would have taken years to save up enough to purchase such a valuable piece of merchandise. He then tried talking Raven into keeping Colleen as a house slave, perhaps even sending Monique away to auction instead. Raven wasn't interested. Two days before the auction, Shane decided to play his last card, which was to simply tell his boss the truth about his feelings toward Colleen, and to beg him to let her stay.

Raven only looked at him with his dark eyes and laughed, "Are you kidding me? I could get twice the market value for this girl, and you want me to keep her and take a loss, just so you can get a fuck whenever you please? I think your brain has gone to mush with all that comedy you two have playing behind my back. I never should have let you touch her!" 

So Colleen was sent away and sold to a man named Flavious for, not two, but three times her market value. Shane didn't give up, and in the months that followed, continued to save up whatever he could with the hope of someday buying her back. Then one night, Flavious took Colleen to a party, and during a private session she choked to death while suspended by leather wrist restraints. Apparently, Flavious had put a leather 'discipline mask' over her head, then failed to give her enough ventilation to breath. She thrashed about and moaned into the gag, but her Master was so caught up in the scene, he never noticed she was in any distress until it was too late. In a report sent to the organization's board of directors, it stated the slave had died by 'sexual asphyxia' (classified medically as an autoerotic fatality) due to accidental neglect. Flavious was so distraught over the incident that he killed himself one week later. Apparently he had feelings for the girl too. Served the dumb bastard right.

Since Colleen's death, Shane never let himself get emotionally attached to a slave girl again. As far as he was concerned, they were of no use to him, other than a body to kick around, or a warm place to park his cock for a while. Yet sometimes the melancholy would hit him hard, and loneliness would sink in, like black bile in pit of his stomach. When this happened Shane would always find himself a slave to abuse, or fuck, or even just to lie with for a time - what ever it took to help him forget.

Shave waited until 4:00 a.m. before going down to see Heidi. Taking out the keys, he unlocked the door to the wine cellar and took a lantern with him. Slowly, he descended the narrow, spiral staircase, while being mindful of his steps because there was always a danger of a stone giving away. Unlike Raven, Shane hated this place. It was particularly bad during the rainy season, when moisture seemed to seep endlessly through the cracked stone walls. I was a wonder the house hadn't fallen into it own fucking hole long ago, but Raven always maintained that the massive stone pillars throughout the interior were strong enough to keep the crumbling foundation secure.

He pulled the set of keys out again and unlocked the door that led to a particularly dingy room in a remote part of the wine cellar. Heidi was hanging there just as Raven had left her - arms stretched high, wrists together and fastened to the chain with leather cuffs, feet dangling only a few inches from the floor. A leather muzzle covered her mouth entirely to silence her. The bitch was a real screamer, but Shane knew that annoying habit would be beaten out of her eventually. 

"Hello there," he greeted her.

Heidi answered him with a glare. 

"Still being feisty, huh?" He set the lantern down on the table and pulled up a chair. "It must be rough, hanging there for so long, with the weight of your own body boring down on your wrists like that. Hardly seems worth the trouble if you ask me."

A drop of sweat slid off her forehead and into her eye. She shook it away and moaned. Her body was covered with welts from her last whipping, and her blonde hair had seen better days, but the girl still looked fantastic. Her large breasts were perfectly symmetrical, and stretched as she was, they provided a magnificent display. 

Shane circled her slowly, in much the same way Raven did before their first session. He looked at the marks on her body and shook his head. What a damn waste! If Raven wasn't careful, he could do some permanent damage, not that she didn't deserve it. This bitch might be tough, but she also didn't have enough sense to realize that her stubbornness would only earn her a ticket to that shit-hole work farm in South America. He could tell that her will was beginning to waver though. He saw it in her eyes. That meant his timing was perfect. All it took now was a verbal incentive and he would get exactly what he came for. Leaning back in his chair, he pulled out a cigarette and lit it. 

"You know Raven has all but given up on you," he tried to look concerned. "Most of the women we bring here usually give in pretty early once they've realized they don't have any choice. At least they don't suffer as much. In time, they adapt to the new life, and get used to the way things are, and before you know it, they don't know how to live any other way. 

"Now a feisty girl like you would never let that happen, but if you were smart, you would give them what they want, let them believe they've broken you, then when the right opportunity comes along, you escape." 

Shane took a puff of his cigarette. 

"In fact, if you played your cards right, you might even find someone to help you get out."

"Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmph, Heidi moaned, and her glare grew even more intense.

"You may not like it, sweetheart, but that's your best shot of getting out of here. I've seen one or two girls try to play this game the hard way by fighting it just like you're doing right now. But let me tell you something, the women we bring here are merely a commodity, and like all investments, some pan out, some don't, and the ones that don't never see the light of day." 

"Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmph!" the look in her eyes began to soften.

"That's right, sweetheart. If Raven can't train you, then he'll find some other use for you. Most-likely, he'll just let you hang down here indefinitely to serve as an example to the other girls. He might even bring them down so they can all see what happens to stubborn, stupid girls like yourself who refuse to accept how things are."

Shane a took another drag of his cigarette then stood up from his chair and approached her.

"I've seen him do it before," he lowered his voice, as if someone might be listening nearby. "I've seen very pretty girls, like yourself, hang like this for days . . . dangling . . . with no place to rest their feet. You think this might be painful now, but wait and see what happens later. First the hands turn blue . . . more so than they are now . . . then they turn a dark purple, as the circulation goes and pressure builds in the wrists. Finally the fingers start to swell, then split open and bleed, right at the tips."

"Mmmmmmmmmmmmmph," came another moan, only now it sounded like a plea. 

"They can't do anything about either, just hang there and moan, with the blood from their own fingers running down their arms. It's not a pretty sight, and I can only imagine how painful it must feel, that is, assuming there's any feeling left in the arms at all by then." 

Shane moved back to the table and took his seat again.

"If you're lucky enough to live through it, then Raven MIGHT show some mercy and let you down. But by then, there won't be much left of your arms . . . just slabs of dead flesh that, most-likely, will have to be lopped off."

He finished the cigarette and waited. Heidi no longer had a look of defiance in her face, but sheer terror. Her eyes were wide as saucers, and they began to tear up. Her breathing became erratic, as though she had just run a marathon, making those wonderful, melon-shaped tits heave and jiggle nicely off her ribs. She looked up and twisted her hands in the leather restraints. Shane could tell they were really beginning to hurt now, partly from the suspension, partly from the growing anticipation of what he planted in her head.

"But I didn't come down here just to scare you," Shave snuffed out the cigarette. "I just wanted you to realize what you're up against here . . . and to offer you my help, that is, assuming you want it?" 

"Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmph," Heidi shook her head 'yes.' She was frantic now.

"Good," Shane stood up. "For starters, I can release you from that suspension and take you someplace to rest a while. Then I'll go talk to Raven. I'll tell him you've seen the errors of your ways, that your mind is right . . . something like that. I'm sure Raven will give you one more chance, but for now on, you have to do everything he says, and no mouthing off. In the meantime . . . you and I will make arrangements for your escape."

"Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmph."

"That's right. You're getting out of here, but I'm taking a big risk in doing this, so it would certainly be unwise of me not to ask for something from you return, right?"

A look of suspicion dried the tears out of her eyes. She knew exactly what Shane was getting at.&nbsp; 

"Life can be unfair, sweetheart," he said, "but you do have a choice. You can take your chances down here or listen to me and get out."

Heidi shook her head 'yes.'

"Good girl," Shane placed one hand against her cheek and tenderly brush the sweat off with his thumb.

"And this will just be our little secret, OK?"

Chapter 19: The Coming Out Party

"Amber, wake up."

Amber heard Monique's voice through the fog of sleep. She had been sleeping so deeply, she didn't even feel the bright sunshine streaming through the window, warming her skin.

"Where?"

"You're on the couch . . . the party. Don't you remember?"

"Oh, the party," she answered groggily.

"Come on now. I have to get you ready for today. First you have to serve breakfast, then we clean house. Get going, or else we'll both get a thrashing," Monique unlocked the chain from Amber's collar, then went over to wake up Shii Ann.

Slowly, Amber sat up and stretched her arms, allowing the blanket to slide off her naked shoulders. A slight tinge of pain jabbed her lower back. The couch she slept on was nothing like Raven's bed, but much more comfortable than that dirty old cot in her sleeping quarters below the house. The truth was, Amber had hoped she would be with her Master again last night, and maybe with the beautiful Audrey 'Marie' sharing his bed with them. 

Amber sighed and looked around her. Some of the guests who couldn't secure a bedroom had found places to sleep around canopied fireplace. One man lay stretched and naked on a full-length velvet couch. A pretty brunette was curled up on the other end like a cat with her head resting between his legs.

She sighed again as the events from the previous night seeped back into her memory. Amber remembered how dejected she felt after seeing Raven and Audrey together in his room, and the smile on her master's face when he saw her standing in the doorway. The rest of the evening was a blur after that. She continued to serve the guests, but her mind wasn't all there. Finally, at 4:00 am, Monique told her to get some rest, and guided her to the couch. While Amber undressed, her collar was locked to a ring set hidden behind a picture in the wall. 

"Good night," Monique whispered, then kissed her on the cheek. She had never kissed Amber like that before, but as strange as it felt, it was comforting. 

"Good night," she answered.

Naked, and very much alone under the covers, Amber tested the chain to her collar. Her hands moved to her breasts, then down between her legs, and she found that she was still sexually charged as she fell into a deep dreamless sleep. Now that morning, she would have to face Raven and Marie again. She put on the camisk Monique had laid out for her, and went to work in the kitchen.

Serving breakfast proved more challenging than usual. Two long tables were set up in the dining room. Amber served the guests as they filed in while Abby prepared their meals. It wasn't until late in the morning when the crowd died down, that Raven made his appearance. Not surprisingly, Marie was with him. She had on a brown single sleeve mini dress that left virtually no coverage for her slender legs. The one sleeve was long and voluminous while the other side commanded attention as it swooped down from the neck, leaving her shoulder and the other arm completely uncovered. Goodwin Stryker and his friend Nathan Rom followed them in. Each had a girl of his own.

Amber did her best to keep her emotions hidden while she served the group, and thankfully, Raven mentioned nothing about what happened the night before. Marie only glanced at Amber for a moment then her eyes dropped to her plate. After they left, the two servers ate quickly in the kitchen.

"I think they have something planned for us later," Abby told her. "I overheard them talking about it."

"What did they say?" Amber asked.

"I couldn't tell what exactly they were saying, but I heard our names mentioned, so be ready."

Both Abby and Marie belonged to Master Goodwin, yet the two women couldn't have been more different in their appearance and demeanor. Abby seemed older, and her facial features more severe compared to Marie's softer, graceful look. Her cheekbones were sharply chiseled and unusually high, making her wide-set dark eyes look even smaller. In spite of her 'hard' looks, Abby still had a body that most men would have killed for. Her breasts sat high and full off her ribs and her legs were long and tapered. Her mannerisms also radiated a sexuality that was immediately noticed by everyone whenever she entered a room. 

Just as Abby and Amber had finished the breakfast dishes, they were both called before Sonia, and given their maid costumes and work assignments. Amber's outfit was strapless mini with a bodice underneath that nearly crushed her breasts together while leaving her arms and shoulders bare. Her legs were covered in black fishnet and the heels she wore were so high, she could barely walk in them. It was Amber's job to clean and polish the silverware, while Abby, who was dressed in a similar outfit had the more difficult job of cleaning the floors. 

After spending some time with Abby that morning, Amber noticed another stark difference between her and Marie. That 'blank stare' she saw in Marie's pale eyes didn't exist with Abby. Most of the slaves submitted out of fear initially, then a kind numbness seemed to take over. Some of them showed little emotion at all, unless sexually aroused or struck with a whip. Abby seemed stronger than that, the kind of strength that endured by learning to make the best of any situation without letting it break her spirit.

Amber wondered which woman she would become after her training was over and she was sold off to another owner - Abby or Marie. For the first time, she thought clearly. Her mind was no longer a mesh of unrestrained emotions, but focused on one thing. For now, she would continue to do whatever was asked of her. She would be the good and obedient slave, until the right opportunity for escape presented itself. Amber knew it would be awhile before that happened, so the only question was, could she last that long, or would she eventually end up like Marie and the others?

Crash! 

The sharp sound of broken glass broke Amber's thoughts. A crystal bowl she had left on the kitchen countertop was set too close to the edge and had fallen to the floor.

"Damn!" Amber cursed herself, "I'm going to get it now!"

The sound brought both Sonia and Monique to the kitchen.

"What happened?" asked Sonia.

"I broke a bowl, Mistress."

"I can see that. Please clean it up. There will be a special punishment for you this evening," said Sonia.

Monique remained behind to help Amber clean it up.

"You need to keep your mind on your work, and forget about Marie," she said.

"What do you mean?" Amber nearly cut herself on a piece of glass.

"It's pretty obvious how you feel about her," Monique said. "You best let the whole thing go. From what I've heard, Master Goodwin plans to sell her to another owner, and that he lives somewhere in Europe."

"Monique!" Sonia called from the other room, "get back to your work! You know what will happen if you don't!"

"Gotta go . . . she's in a bad mood today," Monique said and quickly left the room.

Amber felt even more dejected and lonely while she cleaned up the mess that she had made. Somehow, she had managed to avoid crying, and told herself repeatedly to keep her head straight. She would have to, no matter what, if she was going to find a way out of this place. Perched on her high heals, she carefully cleaned up all the traces of the glass bowl from the kitchen floor.

&nbsp;&nbsp; 
----------
&nbsp;&nbsp; 

Dinner later that evening was strained. Everyone, with the exception of Raven, seemed tired from the party and getting the house in order again. Masters ate first, then the slaves. Goodwin Stryker and Nathan Rom were only guests left from the previous night, and the three men remained in the dining room while the girls ate, smoking their cigars. Sonia was noticeably absent. 

When the tables were cleared, Raven rose from his chair and led his guests out to the Grand room.

"I want both of you to go with Monique down to the dungeon," he directed the order to Abby and Marie. "Amber, go up to my office and wait for me there."

After he left, the three women eyed each other silently. What was going to happen tonight? Amber knew for sure she was going to be punished for breaking the glass bowl. After that, she had no clue.

While the other slaves cleaned the kitchen, she climbed the stairs to Raven's den as instructed and stood silently in front of his desk. Ten minutes later, Raven entered.

"I was told you broke a serving bowl today."

"Yes, Sir," Amber answered. "It was an accident, I'm sorry, Sir."

"Perhaps something else was on your mind, instead of your work?" 

"I don't know Sir, it just fell off the table."

"The reason why I asked, is that you seem distracted lately. Is there anything you would like to discuss?"

"N-no Sir."

"I see," Raven didn't seem convinced. "Well, like you said, it was an accident." 

"Yes, Sir," Amber felt a little relieved. Perhaps she wasn't going to be punished after all.

"By the way," Raven reached into a drawer in his desk and pulled out his riding crop, "have you ever handled on of these?"

"No, Sir."

"How about a whip or a flogger?"

"No, Sir."

He put the crop in the desk. "Pick it up," he ordered.

"Sir?"

"You heard me. Pick up the crop, or do I have to strike your ass with it?"

Hesitantly, Amber reached out and grasped the chrome handle, holding it with her right hand. It felt awkward.

"You can flex it," Raven grinned, "it won't bite."

Doing as she was told, she ran her fingers over its entire length and bent the tip of it with her left hand.

"How long have you been with us?" he asked.

"I'm not sure, two weeks I guess."

"During that time, have you ever wondered just what it might feel to hold a crop, or to use it on someone else? You can be honest with me. I won't be angry, but you have to answer."

"Yes, Sir. I've often thought about it," she admitted.

"Would you like to?"

"Sir?"

"You heard me. You've felt that crop against your flesh at least a dozen times. Wouldn't you like to use it on another girl?"

Amber was struck speechless. Sure, she had fantasized about it, except that she knew the pain that she would be causing if she wielded the crop herself. There was no way that she would ever want to inflict pain on someone, especially on another slave!

"If you don't reply, then it will be 20 strokes for you." Raven raised his voice slightly.

"I couldn't whip some one else, Sir," Amber replied cautiously.

"Would you rather take the punishment yourself, then?"

"What punishment?"

"For the glass bowl, remember?"

"B-but I thought . . ."

"We both agreed it was an accident, but some one has to be punished for it," Raven carefully took the crop from Amber's hand. "Now I'm in a charitable mood, tonight. So it doesn't matter who receives the strokes, just so long as it gets done. Sir Goodwin has been kind enough to offer either Abby or Marie to you, just for tonight. Will you accept this gift, or get double the count I mentioned before . . . that's 40 strokes." 

"Sir?" Amber was unable to decide what to do!

"Decide, pet. Either I punish you severely, or you punish someone else . . ."

The words choked in Amber's mouth.

"Decide!"

"Master, I would rather punish someone else," the words spilled out.

"Which girl? Abby or Marie?"

"I . . . I don't know . . ."

"Answer me. Which girl?" 

"Marie," she mumbled.

"Speak louder."

"Sir, I'll punish Marie," Amber repeated.

"Good," he smiled. "That wasn't so hard, was it?"

"Sir?" Amber wasn't sure what was to happen next.

"Come with me," Raven guided her out into the hall. "We'll have to find something more appropriate for you to wear this evening. After all, you're a Mistress now, and you certainly can't whip a slave girl dressed like a maid!"

&nbsp;&nbsp; 
----------
&nbsp;&nbsp; 

Amber was ushered to the dressing room where Shii Ann had been waiting, and quickly divested of her heels, collar and her maid's uniform. She was bathed quickly under a hot shower and toweled off. Shii Ann then helped her with her hair while sat there in a black g-string staring into the mirror. The outfit Raven selected was hanging on the closet door behind her - a vest, laced up the front, a bra, and mini shirt, all in shiny black leather. Shii Ann dressed Amber, then handed her a pair of spike-healed boots, 

"Put these on."

Amber sat on the chair, bent over and slipped the boots over her legs. They were a perfect fit. The tops reached well above the knee and the soft black leather hugged her thighs without chafing the skin. Finally, black 'opera' gloves were slipped on her arms. The new outfit added a forbidden sensuality to Amber's beautiful figure. It made her feel very strange, since she was now wearing the clothing of a Dominant instead of a slave!

When they arrived in the dungeon, Amber was not surprised to see just what Raven had ordered. Marie was chained and naked, except for her slave collar and bracelets on her wrists and ankles. The bracelets were attached to two chains that dropped from the ceiling, and two rings mounted into the floor, to keep her nude body stretched like an X with her feet suspended just inches off the floor. She was also wearing a blindfold. 

Raven stood silently next to his handiwork. On a table behind them were an assortment of whips, floggers and other instruments of torture that Amber recognized all too well. 

"The leather outfit suits her," Goodwin Stryker complemented Amber's appearance. He was standing nearby with Nathan Rom. "I would very much like to put this girl in one of my films before you sell her off."

"That can arranged," Raven answered, "for a price, of course."

"Only if we discuss it over a brandy."

"I'll warn you, I drive a hard bargain drunk or sober," both men laughed.

Raven then turned to Amber, "Come here, pet."

She strode over to Raven, her eyes darting over to Marie. She was already perspiring. Sweat glistened off her forehead, chest and inside the hollows of her smooth armpits. Her pussy was freshly shaved, so Amber could see her pink folds were already moist. Her clit shined like a pearl with a small gold ring pierced through it. 

"You may begin," he told Amber.

"Sir?"

"Marie is your slave for tonight, and a new slave must be inspected carefully and critically. You of all people should know that."

"Yes, Sir."

Hesitantly, Amber moved closer. She saw how Marie was now confined and stretched as she had normally been. She saw how her breasts stood out, nipples erect, and each rib below the skin was visible. Amber began by stroking her breasts. Marie's stomach sank inward as she drew a breath. 

Suddenly, Amber's uncertainty melted away. The woman she had been so obsessed with at the party was now hanging before her with every curve, every inch of her accessible. She squeezed Marie's breasts between her fingers and pinched her nipples. She then traced the furrow between her breasts down to her sex. She felt the warmth and wetness between the woman's legs and gently played with the ring. This made Marie flinch within her chains. 

For the first time in her life, Amber knew what it was like to the one in control. Running her hands around to Marie's buttocks, she pulled the slave against her own body and kissed her on the lips. After the kiss, Amber backed away, and felt her cheeks flush red. For a moment, she had forgotten there were others in the room watching.

"Continue," Raven ordered.

Marie shifted her body in the chains and moaned. Seeing how excited she had become, Amber reached down again and cupped her hand over the girl's shaved mound. She slowly pushed one finger forward. This drew a moan from Marie, and her body stiffened as the digit invaded her. In a bold move, she reached for Marie's blindfold and pulled it off so she could see those pale green eyes that had captivated her upon first seeing them. Marie blinked several times as if awakening from a deep sleep, then saw that it was Amber who had been fondling her. 

"Sir?" she gave her Master a puzzled look.

"It's alright, pet," Stryker told her. "We've decided that Amber should use you tonight." 

"Yes, Master."

"Good. You may proceed, Mistress," Raven ordered and motioned her to the table where the leather instruments lay waiting.

Amber approached the table. Selecting a riding crop with a broad leather tip, she circled Marie. For the first time, it wasn't Amber that was going
to receive punishment. This time, she was holding the crop. She administered her first stroke with a gentle slap on Marie's outer thigh. It produced a barely audible thwack in the silence.

"Harder," Raven ordered. "Show the girl you mean business."

Amber struck her again harder. This time the blow landed across her left breast, raising a red mark just above the nipple. Marie jerked and moaned, her chains rattled. Slowly and with ever increasing force Amber continued to strike the more provocative parts of Marie's naked body. She struck her breasts again, and her nipples, making Marie flinch against her chains. She stuck at Marie's flat belly, leaving a few red marks around her navel. Then she laid a few between Marie's thighs, slapping the crop from one side to another.

Satisfied, and confident that the crop would not explode into flames because a slave was handling it, Amber became more adventurous. She walked around, and proceeded to strike at Marie's behind. She left many red marks on both bare cheeks.

Amber loved the feel of the leather that she was wearing. The scent of it, mingled with the rivers of sweat flowing from Marie's body was intoxicating. Just hours before, she was a mere slave. Now she was the Dom, and it felt very different!

With a nod of approval from both Raven and Stryker, she walked over to the table to search for other instruments to use. She saw a coiled whip, clamps, a dildo, and many other things. She grabbed four steel clamps, and went back to Marie.

Without a word of warning, she placed a clamp on Marie's right nipple. She gradually tightened the screw until it stayed of its own accord. Then she applied a clamp to the other nipple, and two more to Marie's outer lips guarding her sex. Marie squirmed and moaned. 

"Mistress, please," she begged.

"Do you want more?" asked Amber, suddenly.

"No, Mistress," replied the chained girl.

Amber pulled at the clamps that she had placed on Marie's nether lips. Each time she did so, the slave flinched in her chains. She tried to twist her body away, but the chains were implacable. What could a naked girl do against steel and leather?

Amber removed all four clips and returned them to the table. She then grabbed the whip. The tightly braided leather was well oiled. Again, the scent struck her nostrils and excited her. Since she was not trained in its use, Raven gave her a quick demonstration, and told her she was allowed 12 strikes - no more. Amber tested the whip first by striking out into the empty air, as Raven showed her.

"Use more of your wrist," he instructed.

SNAP! SNAP! The whip cracked again and again until Amber felt she was ready to use it on live flesh. Then she turned to her slave.

Marie was trembling, her alluring green eyes now wide as saucers. After all, what could be more terrifying than facing a whip in the hands of someone with no proper skills, but certainly the willingness to use it? 

"Are you ready for the whip?" Amber asked her.

"Yes, Mistress," Marie answered, her voice shaking.

Amber began again by striking slowly and softly. She didn't want to hurt Marie, not really, but she did want to show her slave that she was serious about the whip. Each stroke was more intense, until the whip curled around Marie's naked form. During this part of the session, Raven gave Amber more advice on her technique so the blows would not leave lasting scars on the girl's body.

She struck silently, circling and never striking the same place twice. Her aim was inexperienced, so her strokes often landed where she did not expect them too. Still, Marie's sex and breasts often received a stroke, making her squeal
and moan. The sounds of her screams and the whip striking her flesh seemed to bounce off the walls and reverberate throughout the whole dungeon.

After the twelfth and final count, Marie was no longer the graceful, alluring beauty that had captured Amber's heart at the party, but a tortured wretch covered in red marks.

Amber coiled the whip and presented it to Marie, in the same manner Sonia had done with her when she was being disciplined.

"Kiss it," Amber ordered, "or else they'll be a few more."

"Yes, Mistress," said Marie as she kissed the whip handle.

Even as she hung there beaten and exhausted, Marie's full pale-pink lips were beautiful. Amber wanted feel their silky kiss again, but she knew the session was over.

"You're done now pet," Raven told her.

Amber handed him the whip, handle first, eyes cast downward in slave fashion.

"Thank you, Master," she said.

"You show promise, no matter what side of the whip you're on," Raven complemented her.

"I agree," Stryker added. "I'd like to buy her from you, before I leave tomorrow if possible. I'll even throw in Marie here in the deal."

"Sorry, my friend. If you want her, you'll have to wait for the auction and bid on her like everyone else. She'll bring in hefty price too."&nbsp; 

Raven then placed his hand against Amber's cheek, "You may go now, pet." The gesture surprised her because it so affectionate. He was more than impressed with how Amber carried herself.

"Why don't we keep her with us for the evening?" Ethan Rom broke in. "I'd hate to see her go after that performance."

"No," said Raven. "She's still in training and she's had enough for tonight."

He motioned Shii Ann over and she took Amber back to the dressing room.

Amber felt deep inside her that something had changed. Still, that night she spent the evening alone chained in her cell. Her hands had been linked to her collar so that she couldn't touch herself. Her ankles were also fastened to the corners of her cot to keep her from grinding her thighs together. Desperately, she wanted release from her frustration, but that had been denied to her by Raven. 

&nbsp;&nbsp; 
----------
&nbsp;&nbsp; 

The next morning, Master Goodwin Stryker and his party left early. Several days later, Amber would learn that Marie had been sold to another owner in Paris, France. Amber realized she would never see Marie again, and though the news saddened her, deep down, she was also relieved.

Chapter 20: A Bad Day

It would be an understatement to say that Raven's relationship with Sonia had taken some odd turns lately, but nothing prepared him for what happened that morning at the stables. 

Ever since the little 'romp' the two of them had on his desk, Sonia seemed to be baiting him with her saucy behavior and flippant attitude. He also sensed a jealousy from his head mistress toward the new girl, Amber, whom he had recently taken an interest in. This alone surprised him, because he never thought of Sonia as the possessive type. In fact, Raven saw her more as a mirror image of himself, and assumed (wrongly as it turned out) that a little physical activity on the side would never affect their professional relationship. Now something was bothering her, and whatever the problem was, it needed to be ironed out immediately, so when Monique told him Sonia had gone for a ride, he decided to go to the stables and try to arrange a truce.&nbsp;&nbsp; 

Standing at the gate, Raven watched and admired the way she rode her mount around the track. Her form was impeccable, ever erotic -- the way she lifted her ass off the saddle in perfect rhythm of the horse's canter, her long fiery red hair dancing in the breeze. He strolled around the stables and peeped into the harness room. There was a powerful scent of old leather. Raven always liked that smell. On the walls, bits and bridles hung together with reins and stirrups. He heard the sound of a horse's hooves and turned to see Sonia ride into the yard. She dismounted. Her face was stoic.

"Have to unsaddle and rub him down," she said.

"What's his name?" Raven asked.

"Fiero. He's a gelding."

That would figure, Raven thought to himself. He followed her into the stall. Her face was flushed with the exercise. He'd never seen her look so handsome. She wore classical riding gear, a crisp white blouse under a tight-fitting black velvet jacket. As she bent to undo the horse's girth he looked at her rounded cheeks encased in skin-tight, tan breeches. The outfit was completed by shiny black leather boots, knee-high.

Perhaps he had thought wrong in cutting short the affair entirely. Sonia seemed like a sensible woman. She was certainly more interesting than the slave girls he had been spending so much time with lately. He decided not to be so hasty in his decision and discuss the possibilities with her over dinner . . .

"Sorry," she said. "I'm dining out with someone else."

"Who?"

"Carlo Santos."

"I see." Something in her voice made him suspicious. "He was once your lover, wasn't he?"

She hesitated. "Yes, but that was a long time ago."

Sonia was holding something back.

"So why do you still see him?" Raven persisted. 

"Is it really necessary for you to know how I spend my evenings off?" She was defensive now. 

"Cancel it," he said. "I want you to dine with me."

"I can't."

"Can't or won't?"

"I promised Carlo I would dine with him, and I always keep my promises."

"Meaning I don't?"

"Forget it," she dismissed the argument, "I'll cancel my engagement, but I'm not spending the evening with you or anyone else," then she turned her back on him - an act of defiance that Raven was not used to, even from his head mistress. 

He knew of Sonia's brief affair with Santos; that she had broken it off several months ago. Was she using this as a way to provoke him again? Or was she hiding something else? Either way he felt his anger rising. He realized now how much he wanted to control the woman, but he let his emotions cool a moment, then approached her again.

Sonia had taken the saddle off and was giving the horse a rub down.

"We have servants for that," Raven said to her.

"I prefer to do it myself."

"Look . . ." his anger began to build again, "we need to talk."

"Talk about what?" Sonia's back was to him, but Raven could sense a smirk on her face. 

"Is it the girl?" 

"Who?"

"You know damn well who. Amber. I know you were angry with me when I took over her training."

Sonia turned and laughed, "Why should I be angry? You're the boss, and she certainly isn't the first little slave girl you've taken under your wing."

The anger was boiling over now, his heart hammering against his chest. Something was coming over him, something too powerful to be denied.

"I won't be trifled with!"

"Oh, won't you?" She raised an eyebrow, as if to say, what was he prepared to do about it? The horses fidgeted and snorted in their stalls.

"Stupid, bitch!"

Before Sonia could respond, he struck her across the cheek with the back of his hand, so hard she stumbled backward and fell to the ground. Her head hit one of the stall posts, almost knocking her unconscious. 

Raven picked up a long leather strap lying across a wooden rail. Grabbing Sonia, he pulled off her velvet jacket and ripped the sleeves of her blouse, exposing her bare arms up to the elbows. He held the dazed woman's wrists together while he bound them tight. He then pulled her to the side of the stall and looped the other end of the strap through a beam overhead. With incredible strength, driven by his anger, he pulled her up off the ground so that her arms were pinioned above her head, and then tied the other end of the strap to a post. Sonia struggled silently, determinedly, but to no avail. Seizing another strap, he knelt down and bound her ankles together. Then he undid the belt around her waist and yanked her breeches down to her knees. Underneath she wore a pair of white lacy panties. These too he pulled down, with such violence that he tore the thin material. Her horse turned its head to look, mildly curious.

Bound hand and foot, and hanging from the beam by her wrists, Sonia had ceased struggling, but she glanced behind her nervously to see what he intended. On a bench nearby she'd set down her riding crop. He picked it up and advanced on her.

Sonia's lower body looked pale in the dingy stable, the small tuft of coarse red hair between her legs seemed to bristle with excitement.

"Is this the only way you can deal with a woman," she taunted again between breaths, "by treating her like one of your FUCKING slaves!"

"You call yourself a woman?" 

He measured the distance carefully, tapping the crop lightly against her bare tush. Then he raised it above his shoulder and brought it sharply down across both cheeks. Sonia lurched her body forward. She whimpered softly. He raised the crop and struck her again, only harder, aiming exactly at the same spot. Two livid red lines marked her white skin. Again, he raised the crop. This time, Sonia tried to move out of the way and it struck her to one side, partly on the hip.

"Keep still," he said curtly. "You're going to get a dozen strokes, and if you move on any of them they will be repeated. Do you understand?"

"Yes," she whispered, so low he could hardly hear her voice.

The crop rose and fell. Her body was trembling now but, resigned to her fate, she no longer tried to move away. Her sweetly rounded cheeks were criss-crossed with bright red welts. Raven knew if he stopped he would not have the nerve to go on; he steeled himself to deliver what he had promised, while he watched the tears falling from her eyes. A terrible excitement was upon him, as though his body were humming with electricity. 

At last he was finished. He lowered his arm and stood panting. He could feel his cock throbbing. He opened his trousers and took it out. Her lovely crack looked inviting, in spite of the ugly welts. Standing behind her, he reached around and felt between her legs. The fur covering her mound was soaked. Sonia arched her upper body forward and curled her tail end up to accommodate him. Savoring the moment, he fucked her pussy slowly from behind, holding her scorched and bruised buttocks in his hands. He tore open the front of her blouse and gave her naked tits a rough squeeze. When Raven finally came, she moaned softly.

He held Sonia in his arms for a few moments, then slipped his cock slowly out of her. He untied her, pulled her breeches gently up over her behind, and kissed her face, tasting the salt in her tears.

"I love you," she said. 

"Let the stable hand care for your horse," he answered, "and come with me."

They moved from the stables to the house. He led Sonia by the hand up the stairs to her bedroom and undressed her, laying her on the bed face down. Tenderly he stroked the marks he had made, tracing the deep red lines, now changing to purple. 

"I said that I loved you, but you didn't answer," she persisted.

"I've never loved anyone in my entire life," was the response.

Raven then turned her over and kissed her between the legs, circling her clitoris with his tongue, not tormenting her this time, only thinking of her pleasure, till she came with a cry of delight.

&nbsp;&nbsp; 
----------
&nbsp;&nbsp; 

Before giving Sonia the beating of her life, Raven had been entertaining an attractive, young couple by the name of Robert and Olivia Sloan. He greeted them warmly when they arrived early that morning, then ordered Bloody Mary's to be served on the patio. Amber was assigned to be a 'paga kajirae' or server. Her slave status had also been moved up to yellow silk. That meant she could be used by anyone in any way, even sexually, but only with her Master's consent.

Raven and his two guests conversed for over an hour. He invited them to sit in on some of the training sessions scheduled for that day. Mr. Sloan politely said 'no', but then asked if they could hold a private session with Monique instead. 

"An hour or two, if possible," Sloan added. "We even brought our own kit." 

Raven agreed to the request, and money was exchanged. Amber couldn't see how much, but guessed the amount to be at least $1,200 in cash. 

She was always amazed with how casually everyone conducted themselves at Dark Oak Manor. The degradations and tortures slaves endured were just a part of their daily life, and there seemed to be no concern that the FBI or local police would ever invade the world they had created for themselves. 

'Their world' was called The Organization, Amber learned, and it spanned all across the globe with wealthy slave owners and training facilities located throughout the U.S., Europe, Asia, and South America. Each region was well buffered from the others and operated on its own. It had been arranged that way for security reasons. In Venezuela, slave farms and training centers were actually supported by their own government, allowing them to run their businesses more freely. Amber heard that in some of the more remote jungles of South America, slave girls were forced to remain bare-breasted at all times, with only a piece of bark cloth to wrap around their hips. Equally primitive, was their treatment by the owners, which was far more brutal than anything she had seen at Dark Oak Manor. It was said; that a girl sent down there usually lasted about a year or so at the most. She couldn't imagine that such a society could exist in this century, but it did. 

Once the agreement was made with his guests, Raven sent Amber to fetch Monique before leaving for the stables. Mr. and Mrs. Sloan were waiting for them upstairs in one of the guest rooms. They ordered Monique to strip off her camisk, which she did, then they told her to lie down on the large four-posted bed and gagged her. Four throw pillows from a couch nearby were placed under her back. Her arms and legs were then bound to each corner post with silk scarves, stretching them in standard spread-eagle fashion with the upper half of her body raised slightly by the pillows. The bed itself seemed immense with its elaborate dark oak frame and canopy overhead. Monique's round hips were buried in the comforter she lay on, but her neatly trimmed 'cleft of venus' was still very accessible with her legs spread so wide. 

Mr. Sloan opened a black leather bag and removed the tools they would be using -- vibrators, nipple clamps, a flogger, and a pair of mink gloves. Monique began twisting and pulling gently on her restraints, the backs of her knees brushing lightly against the soft, plush bedding. Acting through a conditioned reflex, like Pavlov's dogs, she seemed to revel in her helplessness. Her pretty blue eyes were wide with anticipation of what was to come. 

"I think we should use the clamps first," Mrs. Sloan commented while stroking Monique's golden hair.

"Good choice, sweetheart."

The vice-like clamps were applied and tightened slowly, crushing the base of each pink nipple, and causing them to swell as they became engorged with blood. Then the husband and wife team each donned a mink glove on one hand and ran the silky fur up and down her splayed legs, up to her breasts and around the hardware hanging off her swollen nubs. Bound as she was, Monique could do nothing, but encourage them with her muffled moans and pleading glances. By the time Mr. Sloan reached for the vibrator, she was already on the cusp of her first orgasm. 

The vib he chose had a tennis ball sized head that spun on a rod inside its handle. Switching the speeds between high and low, the couple took turns rubbing the spinning head against her quivering pubis, pulling it away only when she was about go over the edge. Monique responded in turn by worming her legs, pumping her thighs and grinding her ass into the bedding. Her barely audible moans were a mixture of pleasure and desperation. Watching her reactions obviously pleased the Sloans to no end.

For over an hour, they took turns tormenting their slave while Amber brought them drinks. So engrossed they were in the activity that her presence was hardly even noticed. Finally, Mrs. Sloan turned to their servant and invited her to watch, so Amber set the tray down and took a seat. 

Meanwhile, Monique was thrashing about on the bed. They were using the flogger now, and slapping the beaded leather tails between her thighs. For Amber, watching this being done to someone else always looked more frightening then going through it herself. Monique seemed to welcome the strokes though by eagerly raising her hips up off the bedding as much as she could to greet them.&nbsp; 

Amber was intrigued with how deeply focused the Sloans were on Monique's reactions. Each erotic outburst seemed to spread to the other two, as if the idea of the scene had been to weld themselves so closely to their sub partner, that her climax would become their climax. Amber didn't see two people merely exploiting a helpless slave girl. She saw the three of them working together in achieving the same goal.

In her role, Monique had surrendered her body to the Sloans, completely and unconditionally, and allowed that physical part of her to take her wherever it wanted to go until she became lost in a mindless swirl of pain and bliss.&nbsp; 

Amber knew, all to well, what that journey was like, having been through it herself so many times. First there were the gentle slaps to the flesh, signaling the advent of a flogging or canning. Then, the "rush" that flowed throughout one's entire body when the whippings grew more intense, dulling certain senses, such as the ability to minimize pain and the ability to think clearly. As the physical part conditioned itself to accept even harder blows, so followed the more potent and persistent sensation of floating in a calm state of liquid darkness. Movements seemed slow and uncoordinated. Sometimes one would even experience an outpouring of emotions, ranging from absolute elation to utter loneliness, but the warmth of a Master's or Mistress' presence always pervaded it. Amber heard many names for this state - "subspace", "the furies", or "highs". Whatever it was, she knew how powerful it was; that anything could be done to her body, while she was unable (or unwilling) to resist in any manner. 

What Amber didn't know until recently, was what it was like to be on the other end of the whip. She remembered that night she was ordered to discipline Marie -- the feel of the whip in her hand, the smell of leather, the sound of it slapping against a girl's soft flesh, the screams. Amber felt those same endorphins she had as a slave, filling her head and coursing through veins; that same high, only this time, in knowing SHE was the one brutalizing another. 

She had never felt such power before, and with that power, came a closeness and awareness of what Marie was experiencing on the receiving end. She wanted both of them to travel along that edge together. This telepathy became so intense that Amber had completely lost touch with everyone else in the room until she heard Master Raven's voice, 

"Ease up, pet, or you'll kill the poor bitch."

Despite the fact that Amber somehow managed to keep the flogger moving, it brought her back to a reality that she wasn't aware she had left. In hindsight, Amber guessed it to be a form of 'Dom space', but up to that point, she was never aware of it. That interruption also seemed to transmit itself to Marie, who had been on her own 'trip', then suddenly, after Raven's interruption, looked very cold, lost and frightened, as if she had been left alone in a dark place. 

Because these highs often clouded perception and rational thinking, it was conceivable that even a sophisticated Dom could get carried away and become less alert to the needs and reactions of the submissive. Just the other day, Amber was told about a girl named Colleen, who literally choked to death while hanging naked in a small room while her Master stood only few feet away, apparently unaware of the danger. Hearing the tragic tale made Amber think of her own session with Marie. Unsupervised, the two of them could have gone all night. She wondered what the results might have been if Raven were not there to stop her, and found the thought unsettling to say in the least.

For another hour, the Sloans had Monique pleading and moaning, until Robert finally decided to "finish her off" with a small wand vibrator designed solely for clitoral stimulation. He placed the marble-sized vibrating head against her budding flesh and held it there. Monique squirmed on the bed, unable to keep her own ass still, until her body stiffened, and with a whimper, she climaxed again and again. She curled her head back against the pillows and thrust her breasts forward, then her eyes opened, as if from a daze, and locked on her Master's crotch. His cock was noticeably hard and pressing outward against his pleated trousers. 

Robert Sloan quickly removed his clothes and climbed onto the bed with Monique still bound and waiting. He removed the gag, and Monique flicked her tongue out to moisten her lips as he straddled her breasts. He leaned forward, and she parted her lips to receive him.&nbsp; 

Sitting with her legs together, Amber was so taken by the scene that she didn't even notice Olivia Sloan slip out of her summer dress, and move silently behind her chair.

Robert forced the entire length of his shaft into Monique's mouth, tilting her head back again on the pillows to expose her tender neck. Amber watched with unblinking awe as the smooth muscles under her chin worked hard to accommodate the massive, intruding organ, which had grown considerably when aroused. Her daze was finally awakened by the soft touch of Mrs. Sloan's hands probing between her thighs. 

"Come with me," she ordered.

She guided Amber by the hand to a leather armchair, then she turned and sat down. Her naked body sank deep in the soft, shiny cushion as she draped her legs wide around the padded arms, signaling what she wanted from the slave. With her lips, Amber brushed the hard tips of Olivia&#8217;s breasts, then trailed kisses down to the V of her body. Olivia was quick to yield - but not to Amber. Her thoughts were still directed toward her husband. His still-throbbing cock had now shifted from Monique's mouth to her hollowed, open thighs. She cried out as he plunged deep into her without warning, and with no mercy. His rhythm quickened, and his thrusts became more violet. Monique cried out again as her body rocked helplessly against him. Finally, the man tore abruptly away from her and nearly fell back on the floor, as though struck by lightning, and he too gave a cry.

This sent Olivia over the edge. She opened her eyes wide toward the ceiling and moaned. It was an anonymous, impersonal pleasure of which Amber was merely the instrument. It meant nothing to her that Amber admired her face and body, nor did she care whether or not Amber heard her cries when the slave's lips and teeth found her clit and surrounded the crest of flesh. She merely seized Amber by the hair to press her more closely to her, then let her go only to say to her, 

"Again, do it again." 

&nbsp;&nbsp; 
----------
&nbsp;&nbsp; 

Later that evening, Sonia caught Tony by the arm as they passed each other in the hall, 

"Where is Shane? I need to speak with him and he's not in his room."

"You'll probably find him in the OC. He has the overnight shift."

"I thought Len was scheduled for surveillance tonight."

"A . . . yeah, but I think they switched," Tony suddenly hesitated, fearing he might have gotten his friend in trouble. "Do you want me to get him for you?"

Sonia merely grunted and brushed past. She was in no mood to talk to anyone. It was very late and her ass was still throbbing from the confrontation she had with Raven earlier that day. 

Confrontation? The thought almost made her laugh.

I was more like a thrashing. Then if that wasn't bad enough, in a heat of passion, she told him she loved him, and his response was less than luke-warm. Sonia felt wounded after that, like a heartbroken teenager dumped at her high school prom. Even more powerful though was her growing hatred of Raven, and her desire for revenge.

So her day had gone very badly, and all she wanted now was to soak it all out in a hot bath, and then go to bed. First, she needed to speak with Shane about assisting her with Livia's next session, which was scheduled for early the next morning. She knocked on the door to the Observation Center and entered. No one was there.

"Where the hell is he?" 

Sonia was just about to leave the room, when something on one of the surveillance monitors caught her eye. It was number 6, Heidi's cell, and Shane was with her. She moved to the control panel and sat in the chair, her eyes still fixed on the screen in disbelief.

Not only had the girl been freed from her restraints, she was on her knees in front of Shane. His back was to the camera, but it didn't take much guessing to figure out what they were doing. Sonia sat there and watched Heidi's head jerk and bob back and forth between the open seams of his jeans. The act itself was nothing out of the ordinary. Sometimes Raven granted each of his handlers a girl for the night, but new arrivals, like Heidi, were strictly off limits. 

Shane suddenly grabbed the girl by the hair and bent her over the bed. Then he mounted her from behind.

"Didn't this idiot realize the surveillance camera was on?"

Looking around, Sonia found another tape dated the previous day sitting next to the recorder. Apparently he was planning to switch that one with the tape in the recorder, and then switch the dates. Not a very bright idea, but no one ever paid much attention to the tapes anyway. Usually they were just recycled every few days or so without even being watched. 

Her eyes turned to the monitor again. Shane was still busy, pumping merrily away into Heidi's bent over body. Sonia waited patiently until the two lovebirds were finished, then turned up the volume just as Shane lifted his head up and groaned.

"Your getting better at this, sweetheart," he remarked seconds later as he buttoned his fly. "Pretty soon you'll be a real pro."

"I don't plan on waiting that long," Heidi was rinsing her mouth out with water. "When do I get out of here, anyway?"

Shane's answer was a back of the hand across her face. It wasn't very hard, but enough to shake her up a little.

"I told you we don't discuss that shit," he snapped. "You just remember your part of the deal, and keep a lid on it. I'll handle the rest."

Then in a gesture that almost seemed touching, Shane reached out with his hand and tenderly caressed the cheek he slapped.

"Now get back in bed so I can strap you in." 
 
That was all Sonia needed to hear. She pulled a new tape out of the cabinet and switched it with the tape in the machine. Then she left the room, taking the tape of Shane and Heidi with her. 

A subtle smile crossed her lips just at the thought of what Raven's reaction might be when he saw what his best handler was doing behind his back. When she turned to climb the staircase, she was actually whistling. As it turned out, this hadn't been such a bad day after all!

Chapter 21: The Man With Two Names

FBI Headquarters, Washington D.C.

Special Agent Phil Trask stepped off the elevator with the latest case file in one hand. He had half a dozen missing person files come across his desk, but this one offered several new leads connecting the disappearances of at least six young women to a mysterious underground sex slave ring known as The Organization. More importantly, it uncovered their first suspect in the case.

Trask sat down in his chair and turned on the light. The name on the file was Heidi Strobel, reported missing in Buffalo, Missouri just two weeks ago. A single thumbprint found in her home the day she disappeared had already been sent to the lab and identified:

Juan Omar Vizquel (alias: Marco Sanchez)
Age: 24
Place of Birth: Brownsville, Texas
Last Recorded Residence: Austin, Texas

Trask then skipped down to his arrest record . . .

According the report, he spent two stints at the Juvenile Detention Center in Austin, Texas, first for breaking and entering, and then statutory rape. After his release, Vizquel virtually disappeared. There were no employment records, no tax returns, not even a driver&#8217;s license registration under that name.

Agent Joe Kelly, tracked down the mother and found out Vizquel was living under an alias, Marco Sanchez. The agent also got a current address from her - a nice 3-bedroom apartment in upper Chicago. Whatever he was doing, he was getting paid well for it. Trask had been working on a theory that Vizquel was recruited by The Organization, shortly after he got out of the 'juvi' center in Austin, then gave him a new identity, a driver's license, possibly even the apartment.

After obtaining a warrant, Kelly and his men searched the place and found stacks of S&amp;M magazines and videos, two pairs of handcuffs, a ball gag, rope, and a box filled with photos of nude women, all bound in various positions with different restraints. None of the models, however, matched the six missing girls in their files.

The sole witness to Strobel's abduction was a neighbor. The elderly woman claimed she saw two deliverymen carry a large crate out of Strobel's house the day she disappeared. The name on the truck was traced and no listing of the business was found. Agent Kelly then showed the neighbor some mug shots. She identified one of the deliverymen as Juan Vizquel, alias Marco Sanchez. 

A twenty-four hour surveillance was set up at the suspect's residence, but as yet, he hadn't showed. Trask feared Vizquel might have been tipped off somehow. Against his better judgment, he decided to go back in and have a look for himself. The place had been picked clean of evidence from the first search, but there was always a chance that something might have been missed. As it turned out, Trask was right. Hidden in the back of a DVD drawer, he found a disc with no label, only the letters K.K. scribbled on the front with a marker. 

Trask immediately phoned Jill Wagner, another agent on the case, and told her to check the national database for any missing girls, ages 16 to 35 with the initials "K.K."

"K. K.?" she repeated, "that's not much to go on."

"I know, but give a shot," he said.

He then placed the DVD in a plastic bag and took it to the lab to be dusted. The only prints found were those belonging to Vizquel. 

Back at his desk, Trask pulled the disc out of Heidi Strobel's file. He was about to pop it into his computer to view it when Jill came over with her note pad.

"I ran those initials and found one possible match from the database." 

"Let's have it."

"Kristen Kroonenberg," she read from her notes, "age 19 . . . residence, Littleton, Colorado . . . last seen, May 31, 20xx . . . she was camping with a few friends, southeast of Grand Junction . . . no leads as yet," Jill tore out the page with her notes and handed it to Trask.

"Did her friends see anything . . . like a black van?" (Witness reports in two of the disappearances mentioned a black van parked nearby).

"No. They didn't see a van or anything else. The group was swimming in a river nearby and last saw the girl heading back to her tent only 200 yards away. When she didn't return, everyone thought she had just gone for a hike or something. Two hours later, they went to look for her, and then finally decided to get help. I guess one of the kids had to walk a mile to the nearest farmhouse just to call it in."

"By that time, she could have been anywhere," Trask lamented.

"That's what the Grand Junction P.D. thought," Jill added, then handed him a photo printout from the computer. "This was taken about an hour before she disappeared. They should have the rest of her file to us in an hour." 

"Good." 

Jill took a seat and fanned herself with her notepad while Trask went over the notes. 

"Damn it's hot today! Do you think they'll get around to fixing the air conditioner . . . like sometime before December?"

"We work for the federal government, kid," Trask smiled back at her, "I'd plan on December. Then the heat'll break down." He went back to skimming the notes, forcing himself not to stare at his partner's legs. 

Jill Wagner was arguably the most attractive female agent at the bureau. The tall, leggy brunette could easily have been a model, and certainly knew it. She had a habit of wearing tight dress suits with the shirts cut no less than 6 inches above the knee, which always drew plenty of looks at the office. Trask even caught his partner Joe sneaking a peek once, and then jokingly asked, "So how's the wife doing?"&nbsp; 

Trask really couldn't blame Joe or anyone else for their interest, and to Jill's credit, under that feminine exterior, she was just as tough as the other agents.

"Did you check with Colorado for any similar cases?" he asked her.

"No . . . no, I didn't," there was a look of disappointment on her face for not remembering that part of the procedure.

"Why don't you do that? Start with Denver, and ask them to cover six months, prior and since."

"Will do," she quickly got up from her seat and went back to her desk. Since the a/c was out that day, Jill had her suit coat draped over the back of her chair, and the silky white sleeveless blouse she wore turned out to be even more of a distraction than the skirt, if that was even possible.

Trask set down her notes and picked up the photo. Six kids, approximately nineteen to twenty-one years in age, were posing in front of a sign that read, "The Little Delores River." Kristen Kroonenberg stood at the far left and slightly apart from the group, her body turned sideways in a sexy pose with one hand up, flashing a 'hang loose' sign for the camera. She had on a pair of cut-off Levis and a bikini top. All of them were dressed as if they were getting ready to take a swim in the river behind them and, judging by their behavior in the photo, probably had a few beers beforehand. The image seemed innocent enough though -- just a bunch of kids cutting it loose a little. Trask could remember what it was like when he was that young, back in the dark ages. 

But underneath the innocence, there was also something eerie about the whole picture, in knowing the pretty nineteen year old flirting with the camera on the left would disappear less than a hour after the photo was taken . . . without a trace.

Setting the photo aside, Trask popped the DVD into his computer and turned down the volume. He had a pretty good idea what the content of the video would be, which was why he sent Jill away.

A title appeared on the screen in plain white text:

No. 1436-05
Female
Bedroom Session No. 2
Duration 11 Min.

Trask glanced quickly around the office. For a moment he considered taking the DVD home to view it there, but he really wanted to know who K.K. was. If it turned out to be Kroonenberg, then this would definitely link Vizquel/Sanchez with at least two of the disappearances they were investigating.

The first scene faded into a bedroom, brightly lit and elegantly decorated. The bed itself had a high canopy with four dark oak posts holding it up. Directly underneath the canopy, a naked woman was kneeling on the bed with her weight on her elbows and her head down. Her arms were also stretched forward in front of her and tied to something under the headboard to keep her upper body close to the bedding and her tail end up. Ropes had then been tied from each ankle of the woman's foot to an opposite post to keep her knees spread wide. More ropes were tied around other parts of her body, her knees, her thighs, belly, and breasts, then stretched and tied off to the bed frame and canopy above, creating an elaborate harness to keep her from escaping the 'doggy style' pose she was forced to maintain.

The camera moved in closer on the woman's face. Trask leaned forward, glanced quickly at the grainy photo, then back at the screen. She had a gag in her mouth, the kind with a shiny red ball used often in bondage. Her face was pressed against the plush bedding, her hair partially concealing it, so Trask couldn't tell for sure if it was girl in the photo. They both looked very similar - long straight brown hair, brown eyes, slender, very young looking, tanned complexion. The camera zoomed out and slowly moved around the bed to the girl's raised tush. Trask shifted uneasily in his chair. Her privates couldn't have been displayed more prominently for the camera, tied up as she was in that position. She had been shaved down there too. Trask read once that it was a popular ritual in the BDSM community to remove all of the hair around the genitals, both to make the area more accessible, and also to define a person's status as a slave. 

The picture zoomed in very close between the girls open thighs and stayed there for an uncomfortably long time. The woman began to struggle with her ropes, which only made her shaved crotch even more of an attractive target for the camera. 
 
Then, from somewhere off-screen, there was a man's voice,

"So are you ready for the lash, my pet?"

The woman moaned and squirmed again.

The camera moved out as the man came into view. His head and shoulders were carefully framed out of the picture though, obviously to conceal his identity. In one hand, he held a black leather flogger. Trask couldn't tell for sure, but it looked like there were silver beads on the ends of the tails. 

Without another word, the unseen man swung the flogger over his head and brought it down hard on the girls raised ass, leaving a red bruise on one cheek. The girl yelped and jerked in her restraints. Again, the flogger came down, and again, each time striking her cheeks on a different spot until they glowed a bright red. Trask was amazed (not to mention alarmed) at the beating this poor woman was being subjected to. This wasn't just a tap on the body, carefully orchestrated with the recipients reactions to create the illusion of pain and torture, he was really striking the woman hard, and the beads left small wounds on her flesh that started to bleed a little. 

The flogging then zeroed right in on the girl's smooth open crotch. She wailed and shrieked, her body squirming in agony against the ropes as the sharp blows ripped into her nether region. Trask turned the volume down a little more, then he glanced around the office again to make sure no one could see what he was doing. The only agent nearby within view was Jill and she was talking to someone on the phone, most likely the people in Denver. Trask watched her as she casually leaned back in her chair. The sleeveless blouse shifted around her breasts, and the black skirt showed off quite a bit more thigh now with her legs crossed. For just a moment, he pictured Jill being on that bed, her body bent over on all fours, naked. He could almost feel the leather flogger in his own hand. 

Blinking several times, he quickly pushed the image out of his head. 

The beating continued for another minute or so before it mercifully stopped. The mysterious man with the flogger then approached the girl and began massaging her tush. Each cheek was fiery red and bruised in some places.

"You've done very well, pet," said the voice.

The hand moved inward to her privates and roughly fondled the swollen, red flesh there. Trask could hear the girl moaning behind her gag, and her ass squirmed a little from the intrusion, but he couldn't be sure if she was still in pain or actually taking pleasure from it. The camera moved in closer as the phantom fingers groped and violated her vagina. There was a ring on the man's third finger. It was very large with a black stone and the gold plated image of what looked like some kind of a bird's head in the center &#8211; and raven or crow, perhaps.

He quickly drew a diagram on the back of Jill's notes.

The camera zoomed out again and followed the man as he moved around the bed. He took the woman's gag off, then untied one of the ropes so that she could straighten her back a little. Trask now had a better look at her, but still wasn't sure if she was the same girl in the photo. Wet strands of her own hair were matted across her face. The man reached down and groped her tiny breasts, kneaded them roughly between his fingers while she moaned. Then he held the handle of his flogger to her mouth.

"The handle, pet," he ordered. "Kiss it and thank me properly for this punishment."

The camera zoomed in for a tighter shot as she placed her lips on the handle; the man brushed her hair away, 

"Thank you, Master," she whispered with tears still in her eyes, "for the punishment I have received."

It was her . . . Trask was sure of it now!

He quickly took notes as the video faded out, and circled boldly,
 
'K.K. video = Kristen Kroonenberg'

Leaning back in his chair, he popped the disc out of the computer. Just then Jill appeared at his desk again. Her presence nearly startled him.

"I ran a check on some missing girls in Denver like you asked."

"Anything?"

"I found one that looks very similar to our case: 

Nanette LaFleur . . . age 19 . . . disappeared after leaving a party in Commerce City on March 13, 20xx . . . and a few witnesses noticed a black van parked on the street before she left."

"Get what you can from Denver and add her to our file," Trask ordered, "and put a nationwide A.P. on Juan Vizquel, alias, Marco Sanchez."

Chapter 22: It Makes The Skin Crawl
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Life is a journey,
A journey filled with choices.
Whatever choices we have made,
We should be responsible, calm 
And even brave.

"Life is a Journey"
by Leo Zhang

Raven stood at the window watching the sunrise over the trees without really noticing it. His mind was lost in thought. He turned and sat in his chair, rubbed his temples with both hands, then stared at the surveillance video of Shane and Heidi sitting on his desk. 

It wasn't the first time a handler had violated the house rules regarding the treatment of trainees, but Heidi was a new arrival and defiling the girl the way he did at the very first stage of training could ruin any chances of indoctrinating her properly. Even worse, Raven spent most of the evening interrogating Tony and Len. Both of them admitted that Shane had been doing this for months, and with nearly every girl brought to Dark Oak Manor. 

For their part, the other two handlers were each docked four months pay. Heidi would also have to be punished accordingly, even though she was more of a victim than anything else. As for Shane, there was no room for redemption. Nothing he could do, nor be done to him would make up for this offense. He needed to be eliminated, and it had to be done in a way as to discourage this sort of behavior in the future.

Raven's final decision didn't come without its own dilemmas though. First, he was leaving for New York the next morning. He would be gone at least two days, and he really wanted this resolved as quickly as possible. The second problem was more complicated.

How could Raven impose the death sentence on Shane when it could be argued that he, himself, was guilty of the same crime?

Just the other day, Sonia voiced her own disapproval over his relationship with Amber, and deservedly got a beating for it. A man in his position had every right to take a few liberties with slaves without drawing any flippant objections from his head mistress. This had been the unwritten law for as long as Raven could remember, and generally tolerated by The Board, so long as it didn't interfere with the training process. But did he overstep his privileges? Sonia thought so. In fact, this seemed to be the general consensus among the people around him. 

Whether it was true or not, Shane had no such privileges to abuse. The laws were explicit regarding what handlers could and could not do with slaves without the owner&#8217;s permission, and Shane clearly crossed the line here. Once more, The Board would certainly find out what happened. If Raven didn't act quickly and decisively, then it could be interpreted as a sign of weakness, and weak men didn't last very long in this business.

He picked up the videotape and stared at it for a minute. Raven knew what had to be done, but really wasn't up to going through with the task. He remembered the look in Sonia's eyes when she told him about Shane and Heidi before handing him the tape. That spiteful bitch was enjoying ever minute of it! And why not? She never liked Shane much, and she was probably still fuming over the whipping she got over that flak about Amber. 

"Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned!" Raven spoke out loud. 

Suddenly he smiled, then reached over and pushed the button on his intercom, 

"Sonia?"

"Yes, sir."

"Come up to my office for minute."

"Be right there."

Raven tossed the tape back on the desk and leaned back in his chair. 

"I'll let Sonia handle this one," he thought. "She might even consider it a privilege!"

&nbsp;&nbsp; 
----------
&nbsp;&nbsp; 

It wasn't until eight or nine days after her arrival, that Heidi was finally allowed to mingle with the other girls during their noon meal -- an unusually long period for any new slave, but it was rumored that she had given Raven and his handlers a very difficult time those first few days after she arrived.

Tony brought her over to the table and motioned one of the other girls to bring her a bowl of stew. He pulled out a chair,

"Eat," he ordered while Heidi took her seat. "I'll be back in twenty minutes." 

"Yes, Sir."

A white, sleeveless tunic was draped loosely around her body, and her blonde hair had been pinned up neatly away from her face. The other girls paid little attention to her at first, not until after Tony left the room, then their eyes finally turned to their new companion as she picked up her spoon and dug into the stew, without even pausing until the bowl was empty.

"Not bad," she commented very loudly, "I suppose it would be too much to ask for a nice glass of Merlot to go with this wonderful meal."

The others laughed nervously, except for Monique, who quickly scolded the new girl in a low voice,

"Look, Master Raven allows us to speak during our meals, but comments like that could get us all whipped."

"Sorry . . . guess I wasn't thinking." 

"That's ok, no harm done. My name is Monique, and this is Livia, Amber, Marin, and the girl collecting our bowls is Shii Ann."

"Hiedi Strobel. I live . . . or at least used to live in Buffalo. That's Missouri, not New York." There was only a slight southern drawl in her accent as she spoke. 

"It's nice to finally meet you," Monique spoke for the group. "I'm sure your training was pretty intense. We've all been through it, but each day it gets easier, as long as you do what you're told."

"I studied Phys-Ed in college. Believe me, I've been through a lot worse," Heidi tried to offer another joke.

Everyone listened politely as Heidi told them about her home and work while all eyes quietly assessed her appearance. She was obviously the type of woman who took her health and fitness seriously. Her body was slim, firm and tanned like an athlete used to spending a lot of time outdoors, but not so much that she lost her femininity. Her face was especially beautiful. High cheek bones, dark eyes, flawless skin. Only a small scar on her lower left cheek spoiled the perfection - a cut left by Raven's crop when he struck her in anger during a particularly tedious session. In spite of this, no one could deny that she was a very sexy woman. Not surprisingly, her breasts drew the most attention from the other girls. They jutted out large and proud from underneath her tunic. At one time, Amber would have gazed at them with jealous awe, but not now. In a place like this, tits as large and perfect as hers were more of curse than a blessing.

"So, what was your name again?" Amber's thoughts were broken when Heidi turned and spoke to her. There was a fierce intelligence behind the questioner's gaze that seemed to lock right onto her own jade green eyes.

"Amber," she replied cautiously.

"I thought so," Heidi pointed. "You're the girl that was reported missing a little while back. Last name . . . a . . . Brkich . . . right?"

Amber almost stood up out of her chair, "How did you know?" 

"I saw it on TV. Your story was all over the national news."

Amber could hardly contain herself. It seemed so long since she even heard her last name spoken, and this woman actually knew something about her too! 

Suddenly, there were all sorts of questions she wanted to ask - like how was her family doing, and did the police have any idea of what happened, or any leads as to where she was - questions to which she had long given up getting any answers to. For the first time she found a link to the outside world, and even more importantly, some hope of getting back to it. Amber wondered if the other girls felt the same way, but with a quick glance, she only saw eyes looking nervously down at the table. Shii Ann and Marin began striking up another conversation.

Then Monique leaned over to Heidi, but she spoke loud enough so that everyone could hear what she had to say,

"We ALL had lives before we were brought here. I can understand how excited you both must be, but The Organization has been doing this for years, decades in fact, and they have a way of covering tracks and keeping a lid on things. I have been here for five years. I've seen a lot of girls come and go, and believe me, NO ONE has ever found their way back. This is your new life now. You will realize that soon enough. Until then, it would be best if you kept quiet about such things. Just be happy you're alive."

"You're right . . . again I wasn't thinking," Heidi offered another apology. "I guess all of this will take some time to get used to."

The conversation turned to small talk - about the upcoming auction, at which both Shii Ann and Marin were scheduled to be sold. Having completed their training, they would be leaving for good in a couple of days, and the girls were excited for them, yet at the same time sorry to see their friends go. Heidi remained silent during much of the discussion. She merely listened intently, almost as if she were studying everyone. More than once, her eyes turned to Amber.

Then Tony came back into the room. 

"Finished?"

Heidi nodded.

"Come with me then," he clapped the chain back on her collar. 

"It was a pleasure meeting all of you," Heidi excused herself politely, then gave Amber one more quick glance before leaving the room.

'We'll talk later,' her eyes seemed to be telling her, and Amber understood.

&nbsp;&nbsp; 
----------
&nbsp;&nbsp; 

She saw Heidi again later that afternoon.

"I left my riding crop out behind the stables," Raven told Amber. &#8220;Put something on and get it for me.&#8221; 

Amber found a cloak in the hall closet before she went outside to retrieve the crop. 

That day, the sky was a uniform gray, the weather unpleasantly cold and damp. She kept the cloak wrapped tightly around her body as she made her way to the stables. It was here, behind the building, that she found Heidi. 

She was spread naked between two posts, in as wide an X as her body would permit, and with her feet dangling mere inches from the ground. Amber glanced around the yard to make sure they were really alone, then approached. 

Heidi could not move a muscle. Her limbs were affixed to the posts with rope encased in leather, her lips stretched wide around a red ball gag. Criss-crossed all over her body, particularly on her breasts, were red welts. Raven's crop had been left conspicuously on a fence post nearby.

"A-are you okay?" Amber wasn't sure what to say. 

Heidi nodded her head, 'yes.' Her large, pointed tits shook with the effort. She was shivering violently from the cold. 

"Is there anything I can do?" Amber added, still unsure of the situation. 

She shook her head, uttering an "uh-uh" from behind the gag. 

Amber already knew nothing more could be done for the girl, and if Raven were to see her talking to her, then she might suffer the same fate. Without another word, she quickly lifted the crop off the fence post, then headed back to the house, leaving Heidi alone and shivering in the drizzling rain.

"A wonderful piece of bondage, don't you think?" Raven remarked when Amber handed him the crop. 

"Yes, Sir."

She got the message. There would be no more 'loose talk' during meals.

&nbsp;&nbsp; 
----------
&nbsp;&nbsp; 

Shane stood stark naked in the middle of the room. Scuffs and bruises showed vividly on his body, his face a gray mask of exhaustion and knowledge of what was to come.

"Bind him," Sonia ordered.

Tony and Len grabbed him by the arms, Shane immediately collapsed, and the other two men had to drag him over to the chair where the straps lay open and waiting. 

From the beginning, Shane never had a chance, nor did he even see it coming. Sonia called him into a room. When he entered, she was waiting for him, dressed in a black pantsuit, her long fiery hair tied back, very business-like. Her hands were covered with shiny black gloves. Before Shane could say anything, he felt a jolt of electricity shoot through the back of his shoulder. It was a cattle prod, and it sent him crashing to the floor. Then Tony and Len appeared, as if from nowhere, and gave him a good working over. The blows were mostly to the chest and gut; just enough to soften him up a bit while Sonia began the interrogation. 

It didn't take long for Shane to admit his crimes. They already had the evidence on videotape, so why take a beating for it? The 'softening up' continued though until he lay motionless on the floor. Next they stripped off his clothes, and finally dragged him off to the Interrogation Center.

Much like the other theme rooms, the IC was all about role-play and mind games, and a favorite among guests. The doors were made of solid core timber faced with sheet steel, with heavy sliding bolts and a small eyehole looking in. The interrogation room, itself, required little in the way of structural alteration, keeping the bare concrete floor and adding only the block work walls for insulation and effect. The adjacent room had a one-way mirror and intercom system so the 'interrogator' could observe and communicate privately with his/her victim.

Sonia was the main user of these rooms. Slave training was her specialty, but she always loved a good role-play, and during parties, guests always requested her services. Usually she was a Nazi or KGB interrogator, and of course, the dark uniforms she wore showed off much of her body, but at the same time, looked intimidating as hell. 

When the new wing was added with its theme rooms, she supervised the construction of the IC herself.

"When the client comes through that door," she told the workmen, "he or she will be blindfolded and handcuffed. I want them to think they've arrived in the foulest, most feared place they can imagine. They must forget anything of the outside world. There must be no hope of getting out, unless they tell me everything. Of course, I'll ask them questions they can't possibly answer correctly. That's when the torture begins." Then Sonia gave them a look that sent shivers down their spines.&nbsp; 

Shane had been one of those men that constructed the IC, so he had a good idea of what he was in for. He could do little to stop it though. His well-muscled, well-tanned body was drained of most of its strength, due to the beatings and repeated shocks of the cattle prod. 

The chair they dragged him to was bolted to the floor, with a large hole conspicuously removed from the seat. The only source of light came from a single bulb of about 40 watts on a short flex that made it all look extremely seedy, plus there were floodlights to assist in the questioning process.

They put Shane in the chair. His naked ass sank down slightly through the hole. With two deft movements, Sonia secured each wrist and elbow with the wide Velcro straps. Moments later, there were straps around his ankles and knees.

"I already told you everything," Shane started to beg. "What more do you wa . . ."

Sonia jammed a red ball into his mouth, "All I want from you now, Hon, is to hear you scream for mercy."

Shane struggled, trying to close his mouth against rubber ball, but Sonia had got it halfway in, and that was all she needed. She then pinched his nose and pulled backward. Under those circumstances the mouth seems to open of its own volition. Shane had no option but to surrender, and felt the hard rubber ball slip in behind his teeth, and then the tightness of the strap as she buckled it behind his neck.

"So how does it feel to be on the receiving end of these?"

"MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMPH!" Shane tried to answer. Sweat beads began to break out on his fore head. 

"Don't take this as anything personal. I'm just doing my job. Raven's orders. But I'd only be lying to you if I said I wasn't going to enjoy this."

Another strap was passed across his chest, under the armpits and through the chair-back. Shane tried to move his arms and legs, using the last of the strength he had left, but the straps held firm. His buttocks and the under part of his body protruded through the seat of the chair towards the floor, his legs broadly spaced.

He was utterly a prisoner, naked and defenseless.

Even more disconcerting for Shane was the sight of his &#8216;willy&#8217; suddenly rising to the occasion! It was not something that had escaped Sonia's notice, either. She ran her gloved hand over it with the lightest of fingernail touches that would have made him jump half a foot off the chair, had he been able to move. She stroked his hard member for a moment or two, and then released him.

"Don't go away," she said with more than a hint of condescension.

Out of the corner of his eye, Shane saw her enter a closet where various instruments used for the interrogations were stored. When Sonia reappeared, she was holding a chain, about three feet in length, with a handle on one end, and a steel ball on the other. She let the ball drop, and it made a dull gritty 'thud' sound as it hit the concrete floor. Shane knew what would happen next. Sweat broke out in beads all over his body. Suddenly, his manhood was no longer ready and alert, but lying semi-erect between his legs.

Sonia lifted the ball off the floor and swung forward and back three times on the chain. She looked at Shane carefully, almost caressingly, in the eyes. On the third swing she took two steps forward. The chain struck the edge of the chair seat right between his legs and sent the ball sharply upward.

The result was startling.

Shane's whole body arched in an involuntary spasm. His face contracted into a soundless scream and his lips drew tightly away from the rubber lodged between his teeth. At the same time, his head flew back against the padded chair back with a jerk, showing the taut sinews of his neck. Then his body sagged with a deep groan from his gagged mouth. 

Sonia circled around to the back of him and waited for the pain to subside. Again three swings, and the steel ball found its mark, only this time, from behind where Shane could not see, and much harder.

Shane's body writhed and contorted in the chair. Every muscle seemed to stand out in knots. His hands clinched tightly closed until the knuckles turned white. Still, he didn't utter a sound. He knew he was going to die, and that his death would be a painful one, but he wasn't going to give this crazy bitch the satisfaction of hearing him squeal like a little girl.

Through it all, Tony and Len stood nervously to one side. For now, their job was not to assist, but to watch, and learn.

Three more times, Sonia swung the chain, and each time, the ball found its mark with incredible accuracy. For Shane, the pain was unbearable. From his genitals, it shot right into the pit of his stomach, making him feel nauseous. He knew that the beginning of torture was always the worst. He had witnessed it so many times -- a crescendo leading up to a peak, before the nerves were blunted, reacting progressively less until unconsciousness, or in his case, death. All he could do now was to pray for the peak, pray that it would come quickly, so he could accept the long free-wheel down to the final black out.

At that moment, he thought of Colleen Haskell, the slave girl he loved. He remembered the day she was taken away from him and sold, then hearing the horrible news not long after, that she had been killed accidentally during a session with her new master. Perhaps now, they would be reunited. Soon.

His thoughts of Colleen were broken when the flood lamps snapped on. Jesus. Talk about a rabbit in the headlights. They illuminated his whole body, and heat from the tungsten bulbs made him sweat all over. Sonia was obviously in the observation room. Tony and Len were probably in there too. And who else? Heidi and the other girls? Had they been brought in to watch too? For some reason, that thought made Mr. Willy stand at attention again.&nbsp; 

Sonia entered the room, smiled and caressed his erection with her gloved hand. In spite of the throbbing pain between his legs, it still felt good. Then she disappeared behind his chair, and there followed the sound of rummaging about before she reappeared and slapped two sticky pads, about two inches square over his nipples. Wires trailed off and Shane recognized them as TENS electrodes, used in physiotherapy treatment. 

What came next was totally unexpected, and even more sinister. Right on the head of his stiff member, Sonia placed a device composed of two rings made of a conductive silicone elastomer called Electro-Flex. One ring encircled the ridge between the shaft and head of his cock. The second ring ran over the tip with two adjustable 24kt gold-plated electrodes placed strategically against the frenulum and urethral opening. A wire was also attached and ran probably to the same source - a control panel in the next room. 

"You&#8217;re in for a real treat," Sonia sang out as she ran the wire behind his chair. "This little set-up is called a Corona Penis Head Stimulator, or Corona for short. It can keep that little soldier of yours standing at attention for hours, by sending an electrical current right into the glans of the penis."

Shane knew very well what the device was called and what it did. He had seen it used many times. He also knew that if the dial were turned all the way up to 10, the results could be unbearably painful, even debilitating.

Once again, Sonia was behind him and hidden from his point of view, then suddenly, something abruptly wiggled into his tail end. She was inserting a metal probe from under the chair where the seat had been cut away. Shane guessed that, too, was wired. He began to panic and wrestle with the bindings again. 

"I wouldn't do that if I were you," she whispered from behind. "It'll only make it more painful. Let go . . . just sit back and enjoy it . . ." 

Enjoy it? Who in HELL was she kidding!&nbsp; 

But Shane relaxed, and felt the cold intruder slide inside him. Mr. Willy seemed to get a kick out of it, in spite of the tortures that lay ahead. What a giveaway . . .&nbsp; 

Sonia went back into the observation room again, leaving Shane alone in the bright floodlights, wired up like up like a lab rabbit. Waiting.

Then it happened. A sudden tingle across his nipples that made the muscles in his chest quiver. He felt a second tingle inside his rectum, and moments later, the Corona began to work its magic. It actually felt very nice at first. Shane closed his eyes and moaned. Mr. Willy was rock-hard now, and bobbing wildly between his legs like a veiny appendage with a life of its own. Then the tingling grew stronger, more intense, more painful. He could visualize Sonia in the observation room, turning the dial slowly to the right, and with a wicked grin on her face as more current flowed through the wires into his body. The power came in surges, each more intense, until Shane began to jump in his chair, or as much as he could, given his bonds. The dial moved up . . . 7 . . . 8 . . . 9. 

For the first time, he screamed into the gag, and as loud as he was able, for all the good that did him.

&nbsp;&nbsp;

After six months of training, Shii Ann Huang and Marin Hinkle were fully indoctrinated and ready to be taken to auction. They would be leaving with Raven and Tony early in the morning for New York, so that evening, the other girls were allowed to see them off. The moment was mixed with nervous excitement and sorrow. Owners from all over the country, even some from Europe and Asia attended these auctions, so there was no telling where their companions would end up, or if they would ever be seen again. Nearly everyone showed up to say his or her good-byes. Everyone, except Shane.

Indoctrination

Chapter 23: One Last Time, My Pet
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
The bright summer sun bore down on Amber and Heidi as they worked in the yard. The garden they were trying to revive was so badly overgrown, that only with the imagination of an experienced nurseryman, could anyone see any potential beyond the tangle of weeds and grass. Both women had only a sleeveless, pullover tunic of brown rep cloth to cover themselves with, and a single cord kept the fabric secured loosely about the waist.

"Ugh," Heidi grunted as she yanked on a stubborn weed. She was kneeling in the soft warm grass, her arms and legs sweating in the mid-day heat.

"I don't believe it," Amber commented. 

"Well it's true," with a final tug, Heidi angrily ripped the weed out of the ground and tossed it into a wheel barrel, then brushed the dirt off her thighs. "They killed him. Serves the son-of-a-bitch right too, for what he did to us."

Amber certainly couldn't argue with that. She remembered the first night Shane came to her cell. She was tied to the bed frame and utterly defenseless, but she had also been through a long teasing session with Raven that left her percolating in her own sweat. She needed an orgasm in the worst way, so not only did she let Shane rape her, she welcomed it. The visits continued after that, and through it all, Amber kept her silence, for fear of what might happen if Raven should find out. It didn't surprise she to hear she wasn't the first. Shane had a nice little racket going with the new arrivals, but now he was dead, at least according to this girl he was.

"So exactly, what happened?" She asked Heidi.

"Well, you saw how Raven had me tied to those posts?"

"I remember," Amber's eyes darted across the yard to the stables. She could see them, standing upright about eight feet apart, the leather bindings still dangling from each post.

Heidi continued, "He wanted me to tell him about Shane and our &#8216;little arrangement&#8217;, as he called it. I told him I didn't know what he was talking about. Then he mentioned he had a tape of us doing it in my room. I still didn't say anything. I was being stubborn, I guess. But then he pulled out his riding crop . . . you know . . . the one with the silver handle that always hangs off his belt? He started beating me with it. That was enough for me. I mean . . . what else could I do? I was hanging there naked as a jaybird and completely helpless. I knew he'd break me eventually, so I confessed. I told him everything too -- how Shane promised he&#8217;d get me out of here, then later how the son-of-a-bitch changed his tune and blackmailed me into doing . . . well . . . you know."

Amber nodded. 

"What a damn fool I was to fall for such an act," Heidi dug her fingers into the damp earth and pulled out another weed. "I would have made a deal with the devil to get away from this place, and I practically did. Anyway, you should have seen the look on Raven's face when I told him. He already knew what Shane was doing, but hearing it from me seemed to piss him off even more. I thought he was going to kill me, but instead, he just put a gag in my mouth and went into the house. I must have stayed out here for two hours in the rain before someone finally came out to let me down."

"But what makes you think he killed Shane?"

"You haven't seen the guy around lately, have you?"

"No . . . I haven't,&#8221; Amber started pulling on a large clump of wild grass. &#8220;Maybe we should ask Monique. If anything happened to him then she would know."

"I already did. All she said was that I should mind my own business. So what do you think?"

Amber&#8217;s attention settled on a pill bug crawling through the upturned earth where she had been pulling the grass. With a look of disgust, she took the hand shovel and brushed it away. 

&#8220;I think we&#8217;d better take her advice and not talk about it anymore. I'm sure, sooner or later, we'll find out what happened.&#8221;

The two women continued digging, pulling, and throwing for almost an hour. The higher the sun climbed, the more intense the heat was as it burned straight overhead, roasting the earth and everything on it. Bumblebees hummed lazily around them as they moved slowly from row to row. Amber and Heidi passed the time with more small talk, until finally, the bell sounded from the house. The girls stood up, stretched and brushed themselves off. It was time for lunch, cool drinks and shade.


-------


In the following days, Amber saw very little of Master Raven. Weeks before that, he had devoted nearly all of his free time to her training, and most nights she was allowed to sleep with him in his bed. Then all of that changed after he returned from the last auction. He seemed distant, which made Amber wonder if she had done something wrong; even worse, maybe he was finally growing tired of her.

Rumors about Shane continued to circulate, until one day Sonia quietly pulled Monique aside to make the announcement.

"Tell the others Shane is gone and that he won't be back." 

No further explanation was offered, but everyone got the message.

In spite of these events, life went on as usual. Amber and Heidi had successfully removed all of the weeds from the garden and fresh peat was mixed in with the soil. Seeds were planted next - tomatoes, lettuce, carrots, peas, and other vegetables that would be used in preparing the meals. Then one morning, Raven came out of the house carrying a pair of leather cuffs in one hand. Amber immediately fell to her knees as he approached. 

"Do you know how to ride a horse?" He blocked the morning sun from her downcast eyes as he stood over her.

"Yes, Sir."

"Good, then come with me." 

He clapped the restraints around Amber's wrists and led her to the stables. The two horses were already saddled and waiting. 

&#8220;This one is yours,&#8221; he pointed to the black steed. &#8220;His name is Tango.&#8221;

He kept her mount steady by holding the bridle while Amber climbed up. Again, she was wearing only her tunic, and it was strange, among other things, to feel the leather saddle pressing up against her without anything on underneath. 

Raven owned about a hundred acres of land around Dark Oak Manor. They rode to the northeast corner, which was mostly dense forest. Slivers of early morning light sliced through the treetops like razors. The insects, which were always plentiful in the early summer, slowly begin to stir to life. Other than this, the stillness was broken only by an occasional snort from one of the horses and the sounds of their hooves plodding through the wet leaves.

By then, Amber was getting quite hot sexually, as the gentle rocking movements began working on her body underneath the tunic. She wanted to cum so badly, and had hoped that Raven might accommodate her at the end of their ride.

They finally stopped at a small clearing and dismounted. There was a fire ring, lined with stones and some wood nearby covered with a sheet of clear plastic. Raven pulled a blanket from his saddlebag. 

"Remove your tunic," he ordered.

Amber unclipped her waist cord, then slipped the garment over her head and handed them to him. She felt a little awkward standing naked out in the open. Her nipples jutted shamelessly from her young breasts in the chilled morning air. Raven spread the blanket down on the ground and motioned her to kneel on it.

She waited in silence while he made a small fire. The forest was blanketed with a thin layer of decomposed leaves and all the rotten things that were once a part of its beauty. Surrounding them on all four sides were trees and flowering plants that looked like nettles. Tango, pawed through the wet leaves with one hoof, exposing the black soil underneath. The whole scene made Amber feel gloomy, like something bad was about to happen; yet at the same time, her entire body tingled with anticipation.

After the fire crackled to life, Raven approached her again.

"Did he fuck you?" he spoke to her bluntly.

"Who . . .?"

"You know who I mean."

"Yes, Sir."

"Yes, what?"

"Yes, Sir. He . . . fucked me."

"And what did he promise you in return?"

Amber paused. Unlike Heidi, she had learned to pick her words carefully.

"He . . . he said he would help me."

"Help you do what?"

She didn't want to answer.

"He said he would help you escape, didn't he?" Raven finished for her. 

"Yes, Sir."

"And you believed him?"

Amber nodded, "but only at first," she quickly added.

"So you knew he was lying to you?"

"Yes, Sir."

Raven began circling her. 

"I suppose it's natural for a girl at this stage of her training to fall into such an arrangement out of desperation. But why did you continue to let him take advantage of you?"&nbsp; 

"I was afraid."

"Afraid of whom? Shane or me?

"Both, Sir."

"I see," he was standing behind her now, and Amber began to shiver, though it really wasn't that cold. For a while he didn't say anything, then finally broke the silence, 

"Stand up and come with me."

He led her to a large sugar maple tree at the edge of the clearing and unfastened one of her wrist cuffs. Her arms were brought around the tree trunk, then raised to the first branch and fastened together once more where the branch and trunk interlocked. This kept her arms raised, bringing her almost to her toes with the front of her body pressed against the tree. She felt the bark of the trunk rough against her soft breasts; she felt the dappled sun on her back, but most of all, she felt a knot deep in the pit of her stomach. She had let her Master down. She had not told him about Shane when she should have. Sure Heidi and some of the other girls kept their silence too, but Amber knew she was the favorite. She sensed the disappointment in her Master's voice, there was also anger, and that concerned her more than anything else at the moment.

"You were foolish to fall for such an act," he said calmly. "What he put you through should be punishment enough, but you went along with it even when you knew it was wrong and you were being wronged. You didn't trust me."

She felt her Masters breath on the back of her neck. His hand wandered down over her body, caressing her buttocks.

"I'm sorry, Master," Amber heard herself say. "I let you down. Please forgive me."

"Then you agree you should be punished?"

"Yes, Sir."

He released her, "Fair enough."

Amber heard him rummage through the saddlebag again. When he returned, he was holding two wooden stakes and some rope. He pounded the stakes into the ground to each side of her, and then gently pulled her legs apart. As he did this, Amber also felt a pull on her arms, and the tree bark pressing hard against the front of her body. She gasped, fearing she would stumble against it and scrape her flesh as he tied her ankles to the stakes.

"That's better," he continued as he stood back and admired his submissive.

Her legs were wide apart, opening her sex to him, her back, dappled with sunlight, which managed to break through the canopy of leaves, looked smooth and flawless, almost virginal. 

"I have been neglecting you," he said letting his hand wander again over her bare flesh. "Not a mark in sight. I must be getting soft in my old age."

Amber could hear the low fire crackling behind her, and wondered if Raven was going to brand her. Monique told her once, that in the old Gorean tradition, slaves were often branded like cattle, usually on the buttocks or upper thigh to signify ownership. The practice had long since been dropped, though a particularly rebellious slave might still be 'marked' before going to auction as a warning to buyers. 

Raven moved away. She could hear him stoking the fire. She could hear her own breathing, now quickening with anticipation and fear of what might come. What was he doing? She strained her ears, moving her face slightly away from the tree, but letting it fall back against the rough bark.&nbsp; 

"So who is the Master, slave?"

"You are, Sir," she answered quickly.

"And who do you answer to?"

"You, Sir."

"Who else?"

"Only YOU, Sir."

"Good," he said. "Perhaps you will remember this the next time someone violates you without my permission."

She held her breath, expecting any second to feel the searing heat of a glowing red iron, but instead, there came a gentle shock across the small of her back. Amber no longer feared the branding, but at that moment, wondered if she would have been better off.

A split second later she felt it again -- the sharp, burning sting of freshly cut nettles. Once she brushed her hand against one, just for a second, and remembered how painful it was and how long the pain lasted. Now she felt them again, being dragged slowly and deliberately against the soft skin on her back. She screamed. Then she begged, her voice rising with pain and realization of what her Master was doing.

"NO SIR. Please, Sir . . ."

Amber's words trailed off into more screams as he brushed them again. Her body squirmed, muscles tensed. Just a lightest touch of the coarsely toothed leaves and stinging hairs was enough to create a sensation of having been stung by hundreds of pin needles.

He moved to her buttocks, stroking each bare cheek with the nettles. Her body jerked and moved from side to side against the tree as she tried to avoid further torture. 

"I think you must be enjoying this," again he stroked her twitching buttocks.

"No, Sir."

He let his other hand roam between Amber's opened legs. She wriggled defiantly, trying to pull her wetted love away from her Master's hand.

"But this tells me different," he said as he drove two fingers inward. At the same time, he let the nettles fall across her back again, the little white lumps showing clearly now where the plants had stung. He worked her with the one hand, moved his fingers in and out, stimulating her. He dropped the branch and stroked her back and buttocks with the other hand, which was covered with a black leather glove to protect it from the nettles. 

"This DOES turn you on."

"No, Sir . . . stop, Sir . . . it HURTS."

Her words however were not sincere as she was now moving down on her Master's fingers, now three, and they were gliding in and out of her with no effort.

The cool leather on her back stimulated the tiny wounds, turning them from painful stings to sensual tingles. Amber felt her breasts crushed and scraped by the bark of the tree, she felt the wetness from her own arousal running down her open legs, his fingers inside her. She threw her head back, 

"I love you," she cried out. 

Raven let his teeth play on her neck, ear and shoulders. Her body seemed to melt between her Master and the tree. His hand found her clit. She jerked and groaned as he started to stimulate it.

"This was supposed to be your punishment," he teased.

"Oh Sir, please, you know I'm sorry!" Her words were broken by her passion.

"I'm not sure I am convinced," he removed his hand and stepped away. 

Again, it was play. Again he was teasing, and again Amber rose to the bait.

"But I said I love you."

"I heard you."

He gently released the ropes around her ankles, then the cuffs around her wrists and carried her over to the blanket. Lying on her side, Amber felt something cool being rubbed on her reddened back and buttocks. It soothed the tiny wounds the nettles had left, and she let out a groan of pleasure. 

"These are crushed dock leaves," Raven told her as he gently rubbed and massaged them against her. "Wherever stinging nettles grow, there also grows the remedy."

Amber's body was now completely relaxed. In a matter of minutes, the pain was gone, though her skin still felt warm. She remained quietly on her side with the warm blanket underneath her, while her Master retrieved the stakes with the ropes still attached. He pushed them through the carpet of dead leaves into the soft earth, one about three feet above her head, and the other at her feet. She wondered what he was up to, and wished he would make love to her. 

Gently, he took her arms by the wrists, still chained together with the cuffs, and pulled them to the stake near her head. Then he tied her ankles to the other stake. Still on her side, her body was now stretched between the two stakes.&nbsp; 

Raven laid down close behind her and pressed his body against her body. The blanket was hardly big enough to accommodate the two of them, and he seemed to have more of it than she, but that was of little concern to her at the moment.&nbsp; Feather-light fingers touched her face brushing her cheeks, tracing her jaw-line, as they worked down her neck. Amber didn't move; she didn't open her eyes; she just lay there, savoring his touch. His hand traveled tenderly up and down her open arm, then around her breasts.

"I love you, too," he finally told her, "but you are still a slave. A wretch, destined to go to the auction block to be sold off to another. Do you understand?"

"Yes, Sir." Amber began rubbing her buttocks against him, hoping he would take her from behind. Her Master was still clothed but she could feel him pressing hard between her cheeks. His hand stroked her nipples then wandered downward across her firm belly.

"One last time, pet."

His touch left her for a moment. She heard him loosen his belt, unbutton his pants, and the zipper go down. She felt his erection again, only this time it was his flesh against hers, pushing past her cheeks, past her thighs, then inside her pussy. She could feel the wetness of her arousal seeping out of her as he began to thrust gently against her from behind. She arched her back to accommodate him while pushing the front of her body toward the edge of the blanket. 

His fingers trailed slowly down to the V of her body. He savored the smooth, freshly-shaven mound of flesh, he touched her clit, and Amber groaned then shifted her hips in an effort to hurry him. His thrusts became more intense, inching her forward, arms and legs straining against the ropes until she was completely off the blanket. 

The ground underneath that side of her body felt disagreeably moist and there was a stale, gritty stench of rotted leaves. Small insects hovered around her, some biting her, but none of these things mattered. All she cared about was that her Master was inside her, making love to her. With a guttural groan of exquisite pleasure her body exploded into orgasm. Vaguely, was she aware that she had been moaning loudly as waves of ecstasy washed over her. 

Each long steady thrust sent her higher; her moans of pleasure fed his excitement. Raven panted and hot puffs of breath assaulted her face; his hips jerked wildly as he too climaxed before falling back exhausted onto the blanket.

And it was over. 

Gently he untied her and took off her cuffs. He rose to put more wood on the fire then lay down next to her again. Cradled under his arm, Amber slept awhile, until her Master woke her.

"It's time," he said.

For the ride back, Amber was allowed to wear her tunic again. A towel was also placed underneath her to protect her from the saddle. Her back still showed the marks from the nettle stings and they were beginning to throb a little, but she voiced no complaints. 

"In spite of this Shane business, I'm very pleased with how your training has progressed," Raven told her. "I think you're ready for the next level now, which is to teach you certain skills that will draw more bids for you on the auction block. Take the Gorean dance, for instance. A slave with those skills can fetch as much as three times her market value. What do you think?" 

"I'd like to learn, Sir," she answered him cautiously. Amber remembered watching Livia dance, how fluid and sensual her movements were, and wondered if she could do the same with so many people watching her. 

"Two associates of mine took an interest in you at the party, and asked me if you knew the dance," Raven told her. "These are good men, and you would be treated very favorably under their ownership. If you were trained, then I&#8217;m sure they would bid very high for you. Perhaps we could even arrange a performance in private before the auction."

"Thank you, Sir. I'll try my best." 

"I know you will," he said. "I'll have Sonia set up the instruction. I've also decided to turn you back over to her for the rest of your training."

"Sir?"

Raven turned in his saddle to look at her, "It's for the best, my pet. I think you and I both know that."

"Yes, Sir."


--------------


When they got back to the house, Raven helped Amber off her mount. 

"Go back to the house and report to Monique," he ordered. "Have her put something on those stings. She'll know what to do."

Raven then took both horses by the reins and led them back to the stable house, leaving Amber alone in the yard. 

A stable boy greeted him inside. 

"I'll handle it," he told him. The boy then nodded and returned to his chores.

Raven unsaddled the horses and rubbed them down, his mind still on Amber. Twice, he thought seriously of going back to her and telling her it was all a mistake, that he had changed his mind, but deep down, he knew he had made the right decision in cutting her loose. 

Leaving the stable house, Raven half-expected to see Amber still standing there, waiting for him, and when she wasn't, his heart sank a little. Staying away from this girl was going to be more difficult then he thought. When he entered the house, Sonia greeted him in the foyer.

"I want you to take over Amber's training again," he told her. "I have a lot of last-minute business to tend to, and I just won't have the time."

"Yes, sir."

Raven waited for a reaction, a subtle smirk of satisfaction on her face in hearing the news, but her expression didn't change. In fact, she looked very serious, almost grave. Something else was on her mind.

"We'll need another handler," she spoke carefully without mentioning Shane's name.

"Don't worry about it. I've already made the arrangements." 

He began to move toward the stairs.

"Raven?"

"What?"

Sonia paused, as if uncertain what to say next. 

"What is it?" he grew impatient.

"Jason Clark just called in from the field," she paused again to clear her throat. "We may have a breech in our security."

"What sort of breech?"

"We're missing a man."

Raven paused, then turned from the stairs to face her again, all thoughts of Amber, gone.

"All right," he said calmly, "start from the beginning and tell me what the hell happened."

Indoctrintation
by Night Owl

(Story Content: MM/f, Abduction, Bondage)


Chapter 24: The Rabbit and Hounds
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
The Acura crawled like a beetle along a lonely strip of winding road, its headlights gleaming off the black asphalt. Dave Roberts was driving with one hand draped on the wheel. His face in the blue light from the dashboard looked grim. In the back seat, Jason Clark had his head back and his eyes closed. Both men had been on the road for most of the day, and he was trying to get some sleep before reaching their destination. 

The third occupant in the car was a pretty brunette. She was unconscious and lying on the seat beside Jason, his left hand caressing her right thigh stretched out beside him. Apart from her legs, which were naked to the hips, the girl was only a package. The skirt on her black, strapless dress had been lifted over her arms and head, then tied closed with a piece of rope. She was not bound in any other way, yet she lay quietly on her side, obviously drugged, her body moving sluggishly with the swaying of the car.

Twice, Jason felt compelled to have his partner pull over so he could 'examine the merchandise' a little more closely, then thought the better of it. Both men had more pressing business to deal with first.


------------------


That business was Marco Sanchez, the third member of his team. Two weeks passed since they pulled their last job in Georgia and he still hadn't reported in yet. When Jason called Sonia and told her what happened, she too, became concerned.&nbsp; 

"Did you try his apartment?" she asked.

"Yeah, several times. All I got was the machine."

"And you used a pay phone, right?"

"Sure, sure, I know the procedure."

"Good,ï¿½ there was a short pause on the line. ï¿½To be safe, we&#8217;ll have to suspend all operations until we find out what happened. I&#8217;ll notify Raven when he gets in from his morning ride. He'll want to see you and Dave as soon as possible to discuss this."

"What about that girl in New York? We were scheduled to pick her up Saturday night."

There was another pause. Sonia knew whom Jason was talking about, and after all the planning and arrangements, it would be a shame to cancel the whole operation now, especially if this business with Marco turned out to be a false alarm.

"All right," she finally answered. "Go ahead with the pick-up, but I want you to bring her straight here, no stops along the way, and make sure you switch vehicles before you leave New York. Understood?"

"Got it."

"And let me know immediately if you hear from Marco, regardless of what that idiot's excuse might be.ï¿½

"He's probably shacked up with a girl somewhere," Jason said calmly. "He'll show up."

"For your sake, I hope so."


------------------


That was two days ago, and still no word from Marco. 

In the backseat, Jason's eyes remained closed, though his hand seemed to move on its own, tracing the lines of the girl's black silk panties. It was almost impossible to get any sleep with this gorgeous parcel lying so close beside him. He moved his hand away from her thigh and shifted positions to give his hard-on a chance to settle down. Dave spoke to him through his rear view mirror, 

"Do you really think it was necessary to tell them about Marco?"

"Of course it was," Jason answered without opening his eyes. "Something like this doesn't just go away, does it?ï¿½

"No . . . I guess not." 

Dave's voice sounded nervous and rightly so. Jason was nervous too, but he refused to show it. People like he and Dave were paid top dollar because they were the men in the field, the suppliers. They conducted every search, set up the surveillance systems, and delivered the goods -- all at the risk of bringing the F.B.I and local law enforcement down on them and the whole organization. Yes, they were paid and treated very well, but because of the risk involved, they were also the most expendable. If there were any breeches in security along the line, then the board members would be faced with two options: make the necessary arrangements so those involved could lay low for a while until their new identities were established, or simply forgo any additional risk by eliminating them altogether. Each man's fate usually depended on his worth to the organization, so Jason was determined to stay calm and keep his head in Raven's presence. He needed to convince his boss that he had the situation under control. 

His hand settled on the girl's thigh again. She squirmed a little under his touch, then once more, became still. Jason knew she would be out for at least another hour.


------------------


The girl&#8217;s full name was Jacoba Fransisca Maria Smulders. Her friends called her ï¿½Cobieï¿½ for short. They first ran across her on a social networking website. Here, the organization had a half-dozen or so people on the payroll, most of them gawky, pimpled computer geeks, hired to surf these networks for any prospects, then track down a home address and obtain any other useful information by hacking into their personal profiles. 

When Jason saw the girl&#8217;s file, he immediately assigned her case as a top priority. He sent two men to break into her apartment while she was at work. Covert pinhole cameras were set up in every room with 2.4GHz wireless transmitters linking the video signals to a van nearby. Her phones were bugged, and eventually, another camera was installed in her vehicle under the steering column. In the weeks following, her work schedule, daily routines, and any social activities she attended were recorded and documented. They observed her every night at home, even while she slept. Figuratively, she already belonged to them. All they needed was the right opportunity to make the pick-up, and that finally came during the fourth week of their surveillance when she was invited to a cocktail party in New Rochell. Through phone conversations, they found out the approximate time of her departure, the location of the event, and most importantly, how she would be getting there.

That Saturday, two days after his phone conversation with Sonia, Jason and his team were in place. Just one block away from the girl&#8217;s apartment, he and a new man, Bobby Terry, sat in a green van with the words Veldkamp&#8217;s Flowers and Gifts, Inc. freshly painted on the side. Dave Roberts was waiting at the pick-up point toward the end of the route she would be taking. Two more teams, one in a warehouse twenty miles away, and the second, just a few blocks near Jason&#8217;s location were standing by on their orders. Everything had been planned to the last detail. 

Jason was glad Sonia gave him the go-ahead on this one. The girl was a classic beauty -- striking, pale blue eyes, wavy dark hair, fair china doll-like complexion, endearing smile, and a slender body with just a slight flair around the hips. Her tits weren&#8217;t quite as voluptuous as some of the others, but they stood out very nicely on their own, as he observed many times through the camera they had installed in her bathroom vanity. 

Jason glanced at his watch. Almost two hours had gone by and Bobby was starting to get anxious.

ï¿½So how much longer do you think?ï¿½ the new man asked, and Jason answered flatly, ï¿½As long as it takes. So relax.ï¿½

Another half hour passed before the girl finally emerged from her apartment, and both men silently agreed that the long wait had been worth it.&nbsp; 

Her dress was strapless, and of black velvet, simple and elegant. There was a thin necklace of diamonds around her throat and a diamond clip in the low V, which just exposed the jutting swell of her modest breasts. The dress tapered just above the knees and her 2ï¿½ black heels had straps tied around each ankle. She carried a clutch purse and a black silk wrap draped over one arm. Her dark hair hung in loose curls over her naked shoulders. It would have been a shame to spoil such a perfect look, Jason thought, but this was business.

They watched her get into her car, a bright red Mustang convertible. Jason then started the van.

ï¿½Rabbit is on the run,ï¿½ he spoke low into the microphone. ï¿½ETOA your position . . . about 45 minutes.ï¿½

ï¿½Got it,ï¿½ came Dave&#8217;s voice from the other end.

They followed her through the crowded streets of Manhattan and out of New York, while keeping a safe distance so as not to be detected. So far, she was taking the same route they had anticipated. Jason alerted his partner on the radio again as they entered New Rochell. 

ï¿½Rabbit approaching mile marker 221 . . . get ready.ï¿½

ï¿½Roger, I&#8217;m ready.ï¿½

The Mustang turned onto a lonely stretch of road that led to a development sparsely populated with large, ritzy homes. Just before reaching the turn-off, Jason slowed the van down and pulled over. A few miles ahead, Dave was waiting for the girl, parked on a hill overlooking the road and armed with a small transceiver box. In a few minutes the Mustang would sputter and stall, then glide to a stop, its engine computer, overloaded with a jumble of signals from the transceiver.

ï¿½Target in sight,ï¿½ Dave said from his end, then a long pause. ï¿½Rabbit is down . . . repeat . . . rabbit is down.ï¿½

ï¿½We&#8217;re on our way,ï¿½ Jason pulled the van back onto the highway. Bobby Terry had already taken his position in back.

They turned off onto the side road and followed the Mustang&#8217;s route until it was in view, parked on the shoulder. The hood was already up, and the girl, standing next to the stalled vehicle with her silk wrap drawn over her shoulders. She was trying to use her cell phone and apparently not having much luck with it.

ï¿½Don&#8217;t bother, sweetheart,ï¿½ Jason spoke in a low voice. Dave had already scrambled her phone signal, rendering it useless. 

Jason pulled off just ahead of her, carefully backed the van up and brought it within six feet of her vehicle. Then he got out.

ï¿½Engine trouble?ï¿½ he asked.

ï¿½I&#8217;m not sure . . . it just died on me,ï¿½ her voice was shaky. Not surprisingly, she seemed very nervous, being stranded in the middle of nowhere. Jason caught a whiff of her perfume as he approached. Up close and personal, the girl was even more mesmerizing to look at. He kept his head though and tried to calm her.

 ï¿½Probably just a loose connection to the battery. That happened to me once. Sometimes a bump in the road is enough to jar a cable loose if it hasn&#8217;t been tightened down properly. Let&#8217;s have a look . . .ï¿½

Jason peered into the engine compartment. He then fiddled with some of the wires to keep the girl&#8217;s attention away from the back of his van.

ï¿½OK . . . here&#8217;s the problem,ï¿½ he said. ï¿½It&#8217;s your distributor cap. You can see it right here . . .ï¿½

The girl moved in beside him to look for herself. Suddenly the back door to the van flew open, and Bobby leaped out. He grabbed her from behind. She tried to scream, but the cloth he thrust against her mouth muffled the attempt. Her wrap slipped down her arms as both men forced her toward the van. Then she went limp, the chloroform having taken effect. Her body was lifted into the back, and Bobby crawled in with her before Jason shut the door. He got back into the driver&#8217;s seat, turned the key and gravel spat out from under the back wheels as he drove the van off. Immediately after, Dave pulled up in his vehicle. A fourth man climbed out with a tool kit. Within minutes, he reset the ECU and got the Mustang running again. Both vehicles then sped off in the same direction as the van. 

Jason and his team made their way to the warehouse where two mechanics were waiting. The other men began disassembling the Mustang, while Jason and Dave moved the girl to another vehicle, which was the Acura. Normally, they would have taken her to a safe house for two or three days, then bring in a truck with a secret compartment in back and an elaborate restraining system so the cargo could be transported safely to its destination. However, given the whole Marco situation, they were now under orders to bring this one in as quickly as possible.

ï¿½Shouldn&#8217;t we tie her up at least before the chloroform wears off?ï¿½ Dave asked.

ï¿½No time,ï¿½ Jason pulled out a small medical bag, took a syringe and gave the girl a sedative. Then he pulled the skirt up over her head and tied it closed. When they were safely on the road again, he made a call with his cell phone.

ï¿½Rabbit is in the cage,ï¿½ he said. ï¿½Get to work.ï¿½

ï¿½Got it,ï¿½ came the other voice. The fourth team immediately went to work in cleaning the girl&#8217;s apartment of all evidence and removing the surveillance equipment. Like so many others before her, the police would be baffled with her disappearance. All Jason had left to worry about now was Marco.


------------------


The Acura turned off the main road, then after two more turns, pulled up to a gate. The sign read Dark Oak Manor. Jason watched his partner roll down the window and press the intercom button.

ï¿½Can I help you?ï¿½ It was Sonia&#8217;s voice on the other end.

ï¿½It&#8217;s us.ï¿½

ï¿½Go around to the back of the house and I&#8217;ll meet you there.ï¿½

The gate opened and Dave drove up the long, winding drive to the house. As instructed, he pulled around back where Sonia was waiting.

ï¿½Any problems?ï¿½

ï¿½None,ï¿½ Jason untied the rope around the girl&#8217;s skirt. ï¿½Everything went off without a hitch.ï¿½

ï¿½Good. Bring her in.ï¿½

The two men pulled their limp package out of the car. While doing so, she began to moan.

"Quickly," Sonia told them, "before she wakes up."

Dave draped the girl over his shoulder and hooked one arm around her knees, while Jason gathered her purse and silk wrap. Inside the house, Sonia opened the secret door underneath the winding staircase. Another muffled moan sounded. Dave smiled and gave her tush a pat with this free hand, drawing another moan, her arms swaying limply behind him as he followed Sonia and Jason down the dark, narrow steps to the dungeon. Tony was waiting for them in one of the rooms.

ï¿½Put her over there,ï¿½ Sonia ordered.

Carefully, Dave laid her down on a long wooden table. Her skirt was bunched up around her thighs, yet no attempt was made to fix it. Jason almost felt sorry for the girl. Her naked legs looked so childlike and defenseless as she lay there. Her pretty brown eyes were just starting to flutter open. Sonia removed the diamond necklace, then took a knife and cut away the matching jewelry from the dress between the girl&#8217;s breasts and put them both in a bag with the rest of her personal items. She turned to Jason and Dave.

ï¿½Tony will take over from here. You two come with me. Raven is waiting for us in his office.ï¿½

The two men flashed each other a nervous look, then followed her up the stairs again, leaving Tony alone with the girl. 


------------------


ï¿½I don&#8217;t know why we can&#8217;t finish this tomorrow,ï¿½ Heidi complained. She and Amber were sorting laundry that evening and it was getting late. 

ï¿½You&#8217;ll be lucky to get five hours of sleep tonight,ï¿½ Amber replied, ï¿½or any night, for that matter.ï¿½

There seemed to be no end to the housework &#8211; bed sheets laundered, bathrooms cleaned, floors polished, the house was always immaculate. Outside, the grounds also had to be tended to, and the stables, so at the end of each day, the house slaves were too exhausted to even keep their eyes open.

ï¿½It&#8217;s no wonder all the women here are so spaced out,ï¿½ Heidi offered her opinion. ï¿½Nothing like a little sleep deprivation to mess up the wiring in your head, not to mention the food they give us. I studied nutrition in school, and what they&#8217;re serving here has very little protein in it, if any at all. No B vitamins either . . .ï¿½ 

ï¿½Shhhhhhhh . . .ï¿½ 

ï¿½I know, I know, they&#8217;re watching,ï¿½ she shot a glance up to the camera and blew a kiss.

 ï¿½Here,ï¿½ Amber handed her companion a basket. ï¿½Why don&#8217;t you take this load of whites down and get started on it while I finish up here.ï¿½

Heidi sighed and took the basket with her. A few minutes later, Tony entered the room. His presence nearly startled Amber, for she was sure he came to punish them both for their loose talk.

ï¿½Leave that for now,ï¿½ he ordered, ï¿½and go down to the dungeon, second room on the right. I left a whip on the table for you. Sonia wants it greased and ready for a session tonight.ï¿½

ï¿½Yes, Sir.ï¿½

ï¿½And another thing,ï¿½ he added. ï¿½You&#8217;ll see a new girl down there, but that&#8217;s none of your concern. So don&#8217;t talk to her, don&#8217;t even look at her. Just finish the job and leave. Got it?ï¿½

ï¿½Yes, Sir,ï¿½ she then rose from her knees and left the room, her eyes never leaving the floor.


------------------


The woman was very pretty, with pale blue eyes and long dark hair. She was wearing a black, strapless cocktail dress and black heels. Her wrists were bound together high above her head with padded leather cuffs and chained to a pulley in the ceiling, forcing her almost to her toes. Sweat glistened off her face, chest and in her armpits, yet a faint hint of perfume still loomed about her. When she uttered a muffled plea through her leather gag, Amber said nothing and proceeded straight to the cabinet to get the mink oil. 

Laid out neatly on the table nearby were about a dozen or so instruments of torture. The whip that she was to treat with the oil had been left aside just as Tony said it would be. She picked it up, examined it. The leather felt very dry, and even started to crack in a few places. There were other whips hanging in the dungeon, all them oiled and ready for use, but Amber understood that the real purpose of her being there was to make an impression on the girl, and it already seemed to be working. Her glassy blue eyes had the look of a frightened deer caught in the headlights.

Amber recalled her first whipping; how terrified she was. Since then, she allowed herself to be bound and whipped once, sometimes twice a day, first under Sonia&#8217;s supervision, then Raven&#8217;s, and then back to Sonia again. Each time, her body was pulled and wrenched into different submission poses by the force of the restraints, until every square inch of her had felt the searing bite of the lash at least once.

The daily routine followed this pattern with some variations. Soon Amber lost track of how much time had passed. She wasn't sure whether it had been weeks or even months since she arrived. What she was sure of was that she had been in a constant state of arousal. She awoke each morning from vivid sexual dreams and laid waiting for someone to release her bonds in eager anticipation of the first whipping and orgasm of the day. Sometimes she wore chains, and with every step or gesture, the movement of metal links subtly reminded her of the extent of her submission. A glimpse of a whip mark on her flesh or the reflection of her naked and hairless body in the mirror invariably ignited a fire in her loins. Amber marveled at how easily she had adapted to her new situation and how content she became with it. 

She glanced at the girl for only a moment. Dressed as she was, it appeared as if she had just left a party or some social event. The only evidence that a struggle had taken place, was a tear in the front of her dress, as if something had been ripped away, and now with the stretching of her arms and body, the sinking bodice with no straps to support it could do little to keep her naked breasts from showing underneath. 

Amber poured a small amount from the bottle into a sponge, took the whip in her other hand and worked the mink oil into the leather uniformly from the handle right down to the end of the fall. 

ï¿½Leather needs to be nourished,ï¿½ Sonia once told her. ï¿½Unlike our own skin, it is made entirely of dead cells. It cannot heal once damaged, nor does it need nutrition. It deteriorates over time, but by keeping it greased, you can prolong its useful life almost indefinitely.ï¿½

After applying the oil, she then wiped the excess off with a dry cloth. The girl whimpered pitifully as she watched. She began twisting her arms against the padded restraints above her head, and while doing so, unwittingly caused the bodice to slip a little more, exposing her pale, pink nipples. 

Amber rolled the whip up into a neat coil and set it on the table. Just then, Sonia entered the room. She glanced at the girl hanging nearby. 

ï¿½Very pretty, isn&#8217;t she?ï¿½

ï¿½Yes Mistress.ï¿½

Sonia took the whip off the table and inspected it. 

ï¿½Good work.ï¿½

ï¿½Thank you, Mistress.ï¿½

With the whip in hand, she approached the brunette and quietly assessed her trembling body, as if to determine where the first strike should land. By then, the poor girl appeared to be in a state of shock. Her flesh looked pale, clammy, almost bloodless in the dim torchlight, her face nearly covered by dark, wet strands of her hair. Sonia looked at the torn dress and smiled. She placed the whip handle under the girl&#8217;s chin, caressing it, and without even turning away, she spoke to Amber,

ï¿½Leave us.ï¿½

Amber bowed her head and quietly turned for the door. As she exited the room, she overheard Sonia speaking to the girl, and the first words were all too familiar,

ï¿½My name is Sonia, but you will learn to call me Mistress.ï¿½

Chapter 25: Madam Isha

Istanbul, Turkey (4 years ago)

Nobody paid much attention to the musicians belting out Arabic ballads in one corner of the smoky paga tavern. As soon as a song ended, a few people would wipe their greasy fingers on napkins, politely clap and return to their dinners, clearly savoring the lamb kebabs and tabbouli more than the music in the background. The star of the evening had yet to rise. 

Raven sat at small round table next to a portly man named Muhammet. He had been traveling abroad &#8211; first Europe, then the Mediterranean with a final stop at Istanbul, which was the center of The Organization&#8217;s eastern providence. Muhammet, his host, owned the tavern and a large villa that doubled as a slave training facility. Both men bided their time, drinking tea and dipping pita bread in creamy hummus.

&#8220;This girl is a real beauty,&#8221; Muhammet assured his guest. &#8220;Well worth the wait.&#8221;

Raven said nothing, but nodded politely. Next to them, sat a group of booze-swigging, leering Turkish men, who clearly had no honorable intentions toward the sullen waitress as she served their drinks. 

Finally, the drumbeat reached a crescendo, and the beaded curtain in the back parted to reveal a brazen belly dancer sashaying into the room.

&#8220;Here she is,&#8221; Muhammet pushed his plate aside and dabbed his fat lips with a napkin. 

The restaurant suddenly came alive. Hunched shoulders straightened, eyes lit up, appreciative gasps could be heard around the room and food grew cold as the young woman smiled seductively, her body swaying with the fluid grace of a sea anemone.

She was clothed in the Bedlah style, though noticeably more revealing than tradition allowed in much of the Middle East. Since the 1950s, it was illegal for belly dancers to perform publicly with their abdomens exposed or to display excessive skin. In Turkey, however, the art had become debased in recent years and a stripperesque costume style developed, with plunging tops and skirts that flared open generously around the legs. 

This dancer's costume left even less to the imagination of her patrons, and there was so much of her to see and admire. A bikini style, sequined top scarcely covered her firm medium-sized breasts, with a fringe of coins dangling underneath against her ribs. The belt was also decorated with coins and sewn into a thin, almost transparent skirt that hung very low on her hips, almost down to the V of her body. 

But what drew the most attention from everyone in the bar was that this girl was clearly not Turkish, or even Middle Eastern. Her skin was fair, almost colorless now under the bright stage light. Her hair, a dark rust color, flowed like waves of silk over her shoulders. She was also taller and more slender than most belly dancers with just a slight flair at the hips. 

The Turkish men at the next table fell silent (a feat in itself) as they watched the dancer effortlessly roll her flat, beautifully toned stomach in sinewy waves. She raised her hands high to bare the smooth, luscious curves under her arms to the mostly male crowd. The gold glinted off her armlets and the clapping finger cymbals; the coins danced under her breasts and around the dangerously low-rise skirt hugging her curves; all while her hips swayed in time with the flute and drums. The woman was a veritable feast for the senses - her rhythmic thrusts and gentle undulations, her snake-like arms promising infinite pleasures and rapturous gratification. Everyone was captivated with her, and the room was full of Lebanese, Turks, and Greeks, all of whom were accustomed to belly dancing and not easily impressed.

The girl moved to each table. While she walked, the skirt parted at both hips to show off her legs, which were long and magnificent. Nervous men with dark, clammy hands gingerly tucked notes into her flimsy garments as she teased them with wild pelvic gyrations. Then the music tempo slowed, and so did her movements. The lecherous Turkish men pulled wads of large bills out of their pockets and suggestively tucked the notes into the gold belt of her skirt, their fingers lingering against her skin a little longer than necessary.

When the dancer stopped at Raven's table, she expertly moved the smooth muscles in her nonexistent belly, until he too finally reached into his pocket. Her dark eyes then suddenly grew wide as he tossed a hundred dollar bill on the table. 

&#8220;I wish to see you after the show&#8221;, he spoke to her in Turkish. 

The woman took the bill and nodded. Later that night, Raven was invited backstage to her dressing room.&nbsp; 


----------------


Her real name was Aisha (last name unknown), and she was a performer of belly dance, flamenco, gypsy, and all the variations of Gor &#8211; the best anyone had ever seen. Though her background was sketchy, rumor had it she studied in Moscow under well-known Russian choreographers, like Baeva Svetlana, Natalia Strelchenko, and Tatiana Vereschagina. As the story went, she became romantically involved with a slaver named Mikhail, who worked for The Organization. From the beginning, she seemed to fit right in with the unusual lifestyle, and showed no aversions to the acts of bondage, discipline and sadomasochism that were the themes of every social event they attended. She began to perform at these events and quickly discovered it to be a much more lucrative venture than any work she found in the &#8216;free world&#8217;. She learned the ancient art of Gorean dance and included it in her repertoire, much to the delight of her patrons. 

When Raven first saw her performing in that smoky Turkish tavern four years ago, she was the most beautiful woman he had ever seen -- a fantastic dancer, engaging, sweet, and very exotic in appearance. He was especially impressed with how she handled the drunken Turks at the table next to his. Their rude, brutish behavior didn&#8217;t seem to intimidate her in the least, nor did it break her rhythm. Raven wanted to see her, so he offered the hundred dollars, knowing she would take it.

But this wasn&#8217;t a social call. At that time, Gorean dance was widely popular in the Middle East, and even in some parts of Eastern Europe, yet it was virtually non-existent in the U.S. Raven wanted to change that, and saw this talented girl as a vehicle to finally introduce this ancient art to the states. Backstage, he offered her commissions, both to perform and to teach. He also offered her a large house in New York, bought and paid for, and most important of all, a new life away from the dreary paga taverns. Aisha accepted, and left her home in the east with no reservations. 

She was given a new name, Isha, and the title of &#8216;Madam&#8217;. Raven called on her often to come down from New York to Dark Oak Manor and instruct his trainees. Most recently, it was Marin, the former ballet student who was sold at the last auction, followed by Livia, the German beauty who once worked the striptease clubs in New York. Both were excellent pupils, having had previous experience in professional dance, and under Madam Isha&#8217;s tutelage, they mastered every Gorean variation almost as well as she.

When Raven decided that Amber should learn, he knew it would be a challenge. Not only was the girl inexperienced, but she was also shy and somewhat straight-laced. The Madam assured him this would be no problem, so Raven offered the instructor a two-week commission with an option of extending her services depending on how Amber progressed. The day Madam Isha arrived, Raven greeted her at the door and kissed her outstretched hand in a continental gesture of homage. Quick exchanges were made with other members of the household, and then she immediately went to business.

Amber was waiting in the Mirror Room with Livia, who had been called in to assist. Both women were dressed in a type of breechcloth secured with a cord around their hips so that the strips in front and back hung down like an apron. A matching piece of cloth was wrapped around their breasts to conceal them. Understandably, Amber was hesitant about her first class, and wondered if she could ever perform in front of an audience or even learn the moves, but after their first meeting, the Madam&#8217;s confidence quelled her fears a bit. 

 &#8220;I believe Gorean Dance is the most gratifying service a slave can perform for a man,&#8221; she spoke to Amber softly in a thick, fluid Russian accent, &#8220;and also one of the most terrifying on your first try. I have trained girls far more inexperienced than you, and all of them have mastered it.&#8221;

Madam Isha looked to be in her upper twenties -- not much older than her pupil. Her eyes were large and almost black in color, her lips soft and pink. The sharp contours of her high cheekbones became more pronounce whenever she smiled, without taking anything away from her softer features. The black top she wore was cropped at the bottom, and her bright red, silk skirt hung loose around the hips to display her navel which protruded a little in the center to make her firm belly look all the more enticing. Her dark, amber hair fell open about the shoulders with gold hoop earrings shimmering underneath.

&#8220;Gorean dance,&#8221; she explained, &#8220;is a combination of story telling, displays of emotion, eroticism, acting, and the portrayal of sexual need. It provides the entertainer, though slave, with much power over her audience, as her desire, portrayed in her movements, likewise flames the desire of the men who watch. This ability to entice men is instinctual for all women, though individual skills do vary. Our primary concern at this stage is that your motions be fluid and appealing. 

&#8220;First, you must find your dance animation. Something slow and smooth works best. For most &#8216;collars&#8217; (slaves) the standard belly dance moves are not a bad place to start. There are 12 basic core moves that define classic belly dance. The continued practice of these core moves is essential for being proficient. Once you have mastered them, these techniques will take your dancing to a higher level by expanding your awareness of how to be creative and expressive with steps and how to apply them to music. Then in the next stage of your training, we will explore the more emotional aspects of expression, which is the common thread of all the Gorean dances.&#8221;

So they began with the basic hip twists and thrusts. Both Madam Isha and Livia demonstrated, followed by Amber mimicking each movement. With just three strips of paltry cloth to cover her body, her trainers were able to observe how her smooth muscles worked, and then correct her whenever she was doing something wrong. Amber could also see her own reflection in the mirrors that surrounded them on all four walls, which helped her master the dance isolations. 

During the next few classes, they moved on to the more advanced moves &#8211; hip circles and figure eights, belly rolls, arm waves, shoulder rotations with arm ripples (or snake arms, as they were commonly called). Amber watched herself intently in the mirrors from all sides. She became increasingly aware of the empty space of open air around her, and how her body interacted with it. She could feel each feathery touch of the cloth swishing between her legs, and how the soft fabric shifted against her pointed breasts underneath.

In less than two weeks, she was putting all of her core moves together to music, and Madam Isha was very pleased with the results so far. When she reported this to Raven, he immediately extended her commission another month. 


----------------


As each day passed, Amber thought less and less of returning to her &#8216;old life&#8217;. She began to think of Dark Oak Manor as her home now, at least until the time came when she would be auctioned off to another owner.&nbsp; The training process, though short, had been very effective so far, and like hundreds of women before her, Amber would be fully indoctrinated in a matter of weeks. So when Heidi approached her with an escape plan, she was understandably reluctant.

&#8220;And just HOW are we supposed to get away? &#8220; she asked Heidi. &#8220;This house has cameras everywhere.&#8221;

&#8220;Not quite,&#8221; her friend smiled. &#8220;That old wine cellar underneath the house doesn&#8217;t have any cameras.&#8221;

Amber thought about this for a minute. The wine cellar was nicknamed &#8216;the rabbit hole&#8217;, and aptly so, for its narrow &#8216;corkscrew&#8217; staircase that descended from the dungeon, and the maze of rooms and tight corridors. She had been down there at least a dozen times, yet couldn&#8217;t remember seeing even one camera.

&#8220;Are you sure about this?&#8221;

&#8220;Positive. Len told me.&#8221;

&#8220;Yeah, but is he telling you the truth, or just pulling your leg?&#8221;

&#8220;It&#8217;s the truth. I think that little creep has a crush on me or something because he was very talkative about it, like he was trying to impress me, so I acted all giddy just to string him along.&#8221;

&#8220;Heidi, that&#8217;s dangerous!&#8221;

&#8220;Every day we spend here is dangerous. Don&#8217;t you want to get out of here?&#8221;

&#8220;Sure.&#8221;

&#8220;Anyway, he told me something else about the wine cellar.&#8221;

&#8220;What?&#8221;

&#8220;Get this -- did you know there&#8217;s an escape tunnel down there?&#8221;

&#8220;No! Where?&#8221;

&#8220;In the room they had me locked in when they first brought me here. I saw it. There&#8217;s a door in the foundation, about three feet square, with a paddle lock on it. Len told me it leads to a tunnel that goes about three hundred feet into the woods.&#8221;

&#8220;You don&#8217;t say?&#8221;

Heidi nodded, then glanced over her shoulder to make sure they were still alone. Amber did the same.

&#8220;Have you ever heard of the Underground Railroad . . . you know . . . before the Civil War?&#8221;

&#8220;I think so,&#8221; Amber tried to recall her high school history. It wasn&#8217;t her favorite subject. She hated having to remember all the names and dates, so much that she usually retained the information only long enough to get through the tests, then quickly forgot everything not long after.

&#8220;It&#8217;s like this,&#8221; Heidi continued. &#8220;During the 1850s, there was an anti-slavery movement, a network of people who assisted runaway black slaves in getting them to the North and Canada. This house was a part of that network.&#8221;

&#8220;You&#8217;re kidding?&#8221;

&#8220;That&#8217;s what Len told me. He said the wine cellar was used to house as many as 70 slaves. That&#8217;s why all of those rooms were built, and the secret tunnel was part of their escape route, in case the house was ever searched. I guess the tunnel was never filled in. Now Raven keeps it in case the cops or Feds ever raid this place.&#8221;

Heidi then sat back and smiled, &#8220;It&#8217;s kind of ironic, isn&#8217;t it? That this house was once used to help FREE slaves?&#8221;

&#8220;Yeah, ironic.&#8221;

Heidi leaned forward again, &#8220;Well that&#8217;s our ticket out of here. We just need to find the right opportunity so we can make a clean break before they realize what&#8217;s happened.&#8221;

&#8220;But you said the entrance to the tunnel was paddle locked.&#8221;

&#8220;I&#8217;m sure I can pick it. My brother taught me how with a hair pin once, and I have one hidden in my cell. I took it from a drawer in the dressing room while nobody was looking. So are you in?&#8221;

&#8220;I . . . I don&#8217;t know. If we get caught, then I&#8217;d hate to think what Master Raven would do to us.&#8221;

&#8220;That&#8217;s a chance worth taking, isn&#8217;t it? I mean, would you rather live like this the rest of your life?&#8221;

&#8220;No . . . but . . . I just need to think about it. OK?&#8221;

&#8220;All right, but don&#8217;t take too long.&#8221;


----------------


With Madam Isha&#8217;s arrival, a party was immediately planned with the promise that she would perform for the guests. That night, the girls showered, carefully painted, and curled. Outfits were handed out to each of them. Amber was given a lime green &#8216;tube&#8217; dress with cross lacing up the sides. Standing in front of the fill length mirror, she put on her stiletto pumps and silver hoop earrings, then turned from side to side, making sure everything looked perfect. The strapless garment hugged her medium-sized breasts for a pleasing shape, while the skirt covered just enough of her derriare to give her a look of innocent sexiness. For added interest, the lace up the sides opened generously &#8211; enough to eliminate any assumptions that she had something on between her and the dress.

The party was a smaller affair than the last one, about three dozen people, and not as formal. Masters&#8217; Goodwin Stryker and Ethan Rom made the trip down from New York to attend. Goodwin had one slave now, Abby (the other girl, Marie, having recently been sold to another owner), and it was rumored he was interested in bidding for Amber at the next auction. 

Another owner Amber recognized was Master Stefan. He brought his two slaves, Shawna and Kate. Amber knew Shawna from the last party. Together they had served drinks throughout most of the night. She was gregarious, open-minded and charismatic, which were unusual traits for a slave. Amber liked her a lot. She had a pretty face, more cute and endearing than beautiful. At 5&#8217;4&#8221; she was petite, but also athletic, with skin the color of light Carmel, and one couldn&#8217;t help but notice her curly brown hair with its gorgeous ringlets just kissing her shoulders. From what Amber knew about her, Shawna had been a product of middle-aged parents that had grown up in the 60&#8217;s.

The other girl, Kate, appeared to be just the opposite of Shawna &#8211; more quiet and reserved. She was also slender (almost to the point of frailty), and her smooth skin was the color of alabaster. Her eyes were the darkest brown. Her dark hair had a well-defined part to the side and flowed in lush waves around her shoulders, complimenting a look that was both sophisticated and stunning. Kate was older than most of the other girls, about 30 or so, and though some of her features may have softened a little, she still drew a lot of attention from the guests. The flirty dark brown mini dress she wore dipped asymmetrically at the neckline to bare one shoulder and arm while the single sleeve covering her other arm was long and voluminous. The short skirt commanded attention to her long legs, and a decorative gold chain belt hanging loose around her waist matched the gold stiletto heels. 

While guests mingled, the kitchen was a buzz with activity. Beef, chicken, shrimp, scallops, and various vegetables in soybean oil sizzled on a large Japanese-style teppan cooker, while the sounds of clanging metal spatulas filled the air with promise of delicious tastes. Top grade wine was served before and after the meal. Finally, everyone moved into the Grand Room for the evening&#8217;s entertainment. 

The music began and the first dancer started. She looked Middle Eastern with skin the same color as creamed coffee, chocolate brown eyes, and black hair pulled back into a neat braid. Her sensuous figure was made even more so by her costume which was a shining ensemble of green and silver. Her skirt dipped down in front and she had a beautiful stone in her navel. She performed a traditional belly dance, nothing too provocative, but enough the warm up the small audience. Silver chains dangled from her top and danced over her slinking abdomen. The green silk skirt wound around her legs as if it were an open fan. She moved from man to man, clapping her symbols, until her song was ended, then she went into the back. 

The next dancer to perform was Livia, and her costume was much more revealing. She strode to the center of the circle wearing two strips of very long silk that flowed down between her naked legs in front and in back from a small gold belt chain hung low around her hips. Another piece of purple silk was wrapped tightly around her breasts and looped through a gold o-ring in the front. Her eye make-up was very dramatic, her collar and armlets were of gold. The spiky tribal tattoo that dipped downward from her pelvic bone added to the savage simplicity of her ensemble. Two men approached her and Livia stood proudly at the center of the circle, head back, arms down and extended slightly at the sides, while gold slave bells mounted in double rows to black leather straps were fastened to her wrists and ankles.&nbsp; 

Then, to the barbaric, intoxicating cadence of the flute and drums, she began to sway, the bells on her ankles marking each of her movements. With her long legs and ultra-lean frame, she had the quintessential dancer&#8217;s body. Her firm, smallish breasts bounced provocatively under the silk wrapped around them. Her arms sliced through the open air in snake-like fashion, the bells jingling sensuously from her wrists. When the performance was over, it was hard to imagine that anything could match it, but the main act was still to come, and everyone knew Isha would not disappoint them. 

Ten minutes passed, then fifteen until a gong drew everyone&#8217;s attention back to the center circle. Two men and two women entered the room. They were dressed like characters out of Arabian Nights. They wore slipper shoes and silk baggy pants that were tight around their waists and ankles. Their upper bodies were clad only bright sequined vests left open in front, while the women in addition wore a type of silk bra around their breasts. They each took a position at all four corners of the circle and slowly sank to their knees.

When Isha entered, she was covered from head to toe in shimmering dancing veils of green, blue, and purple. Around her head, she wore a &#8216;hijab&#8217; or scarf made of black Egyptian cotton. A smaller veil hid much of her face except for her smoldering dark eyes. She took her stance, arms down at the sides, one knee bent and the toe extended downward. When the drum started she swayed to its slow beat, hips drawing a figure eight upon the tiled floor in a sinuous motion. The flutes joined in, the rhythm increased and her veils fluttered and flared out as she turned. 

Every move she made was concise and perfectly choreographed. She whirled in a fluttering calliope of colors, hips swaying while her hands traveled her body, feeling for flesh beneath the concealing veils. Her hand found a purple veil hanging off her right hip, and it escaped from the gold cord tied about her waist with a gentle tug, suddenly baring her right leg up to the hip &#8211; a startling revelation of human flesh among the swirling dark silks. She reached down to her right hip, and pulling the purple veil free, she exposed that leg as well for all to see. Each time a veil dropped to the floor, the male or female attendant kneeling closest would sweep one arm out to retrieve it. 

Isha seemed to move even more fluidly now with her legs free to dance among the remaining veils. Around and around she twirled, feet dancing fast in tiny steps, arms lifting up high then down again in a graceful motion, allowing the veils to slide down briefly to her shoulders and give her audience a teasing glimpse of more flesh. She danced around the perimeter of the circle, only feet away from those in the audience fortunate enough to have found a seat in front, her chest lifting against the veils as her hips rolled to the music. Moving back to the center, she turned, glanced about as she shimmied her shoulders back a little. Then she lifted her hands to the scarf concealing her head and pulled it away, freeing a mane of long rust colored hair while shaking it wild about her face. 

Isha danced the perimeter again, teasing her audience. The veils still covered most of her body and face &#8211; an odd contrast next to her legs, creating an enticing dichotomy of a demure, but tantalizing female. Occasionally one hand came down to slap a bare thigh, punctuating the drumbeat. She moved back to the center, looked around, her dark eyes dancing over the blue veil. You could almost see her seductive smile behind it as she slowed her dance until only her hips moved, body undulating in place. She ran her hands up her thighs, her fingers traced the length of gold cord around her waist, then released it, dropping it to the floor. Hips were still swaying to the music as she reached for a clip on her left shoulder and released another veil, then to the right shoulder, and another. Her naked arms were now exposed with the remaining veils hanging off one shoulder and around her hips. They outlined her form, gliding over her curves in a way that both revealed and concealed. Slowly, teasingly, she brought her hands to the veil at her face and held it before her a moment before striping it away to reveal all of her face. She had rouged lips, and like her talents, her inviting smile was irresistible. 

She tossed her head, her burnt amber mane flying as her dance took on a new tone. Gone was the teasing, flirting revelation of flesh. She fell to the floor, rolled across it, then rose to her knees. Her hand tugged at the first veil on her shoulder, impatient it seemed to free her body from it, and the blue veil fluttered behind her and about her as she rose and spun away upon her toes. A veil around her hips came off next and slithered down her to form puddle at her feet. Only one veil remained, a red one, fastened to one shoulder and flowing down her body between her legs.

The audience grew even more excited, for they could now see shadows of Isha&#8217;s body under the diaphamous material. Her firm, lush breasts shook provocatively under the shear cloth with each movement, her nipples pushing outward against it, hips shifting in figure eights. The drum beat faster, and the crowd began to clap their hands in time with its rhythm. Isha swept her arms outward in a wide arch until they came together at the wrists high above her head as if they were clapped in restraints, then she began to spin her body, faster and faster, her feet almost seeming not to touch the floor at all, the remaining veil flowing about her body as the music droned its primal beat. 

Isha then moved to Raven and offered the trailing end of the remaining veil with a flick of her hand and hip. She smiled, winking to him as he grasped it, then with an explosion of energy, she spun away from him while releasing the clip on her shoulder. The veil slithered free from her body and fluttered down to the floor at Raven&#8217;s feet. She was naked now, save for a gold slave collar about her neck. Isha tossed her head and danced in her wild freedom, hair flaring out in waves of fire. Laughter escaped her red lips with the joy of the music, her feet pounding out the beat. Her nude flesh glowed from her exertions as she danced brazenly around the circle. When the music&#8217;s tempo slowed, so did she. Facing Raven, she slipped silently to her knees and lifted her chin high to show her collar. She then arched backward, her thighs parted wide to reveal her &#8216;slave&#8217;s heat&#8217; and brand upon her inner thigh, her body now offered as a homage to the party&#8217;s host. As she held the pose, Isha panted and her chest heaved, her body sweating. After the music faded, the small crowd erupted with applause. Even Raven was impressed. Isha bowed her head in return as the Dance of Seven Veils came to its conclusion.

When Amber saw her again moving through the crowd, she looked especially beautiful that evening. Gone was the collar, the veils and the brand. She was no longer the slave as depicted in her dance, but treated like royalty by the other guests. She stood under the light of the chandelier, her smooth rust-colored hair tied back and clinging to her skull, the pale green satin of her strapless gown hanging low around her breasts, alive like water about to stream off and expose her soft, argent skin. Amber envied her, for she could enjoy the benefits and carnal pleasures this lifestyle offered, then leave it whenever she pleased and rejoin the world outside. She was like Venus rising up from an open manhole on a city street.

After the food, drinks and entertainment, everyone was in a mood to play, and slowly the party moved downstairs into the dungeon. Guests began to branch out to the many rooms and implements of torture they each had to offer. Slaves were bartered and traded off for sessions that would most-likely last all evening. 

One small group gathered around a padded table that stood about 30&#8221; in height and 6 feet long. Master Stefan called his slave, Kate, into the room and had her lie on her side. The one-sleeved mini dress everyone admired her in earlier was gone now, and her pale, naked body stood out glaringly against the cushioned black leather. 

Stefan took the leg beneath her, bent it sharply backward and tied the ankle with rope to her adjacent wrist. Her other arm and leg were then raised high and cuffed together to a chain that dropped from the ceiling, thus depriving her the use of those limbs as well. Kate was about as vulnerable in this position as any woman could be, still on her side with her smooth, shaved crotch stretched open for all to see. 

There were moans of approval in the room as Stefan produced the device he would use -- a vibrator fastened to a 3 ft. pole. He flipped the switch, the motor inside hummed, and the soft, flesh colored rubber ball on the end of the vibrator began to spin at high speed. What happened next, drove poor Kate to hysterics. She jerked violently on the table, twisting and rolling her pale body back and forth against the black padded leather while her Master held the spinning ball against her. Juices from her pussy dripped down her inner thigh onto the black leather paddind. Master Stefan set the vibrator down briefly to reach into his coat pocket and pull out two steel clamps linked together with a small chain. He fastened the clamps to her nipples, tightened the screw on each until her pale-pink nubs swelled and turned a dark red. He then took the vib and resumed the assault. Kate rewarded the small crowd again with her frantic gyrations while the chain danced between her small breasts. When Stefan was through with her, he graciously offered everyone else a try, lengthening the session another twenty minutes or so. By then, the girl was whimpering like a kitten behind her gag.

Once again, Amber served drinks, this time with Heidi, who was still a &#8216;white silk&#8217; and marked off-limits from guests. Being a &#8216;yellow silk&#8217;, Amber wondered why she had not been chosen for a session, though deep down, she was thankful for it. Then Raven approached her,

&#8220;Get started on cleaning the kitchen. I&#8217;ll send someone up later to help.&#8221;&nbsp; 
 
&#8220;Yes, Sir.&#8221;

She climbed the narrow steps to the main level, which now seemed strangely quiet with all guests down in the dungeon. The kitchen was very large and state of the art. All of the appliances were made of brushed stainless steel and the counters topped with polished black marble. At the center of the room, there was a long island with the teppan cooker built into the countertop at one end. 

Amber decided to start there. She opened the cabinet under the sink and pulled out the cleaning supplies, adjusting her short shirt again after putting them on the counter.&nbsp; It was then, she noticed Ethan Rom standing in the room with her. Before she could say anything, he cut her off. 

"Be silent, and do exactly as I say. Stand still. Eyes to the floor."

Amber did as she was told while he approached. Ethan&#8217;s eyes were pale, cold, and even though she was looking down, she could feel them tracing the lines of her body underneath the dress she wore. 

&#8220;Sir, I was told to clean the kitch . . .&#8221;

&#8220;I told you to be silent!&#8221; He slapped her across the cheek, then snapped his fingers and, in the swift double gesture, pointed to a place on the floor before him while almost simultaneously turning his hand and spreading the first and index fingers. Amber recognized the signal and immediately knelt before him in the position of a pleasure slave &#8211; head down, arms thrust forward, ass tilted upward. She began to tremble.

Ethan moved behind her. The dress, as tight-fitting as it was, slipped easily up and over her hips. Her smooth privates were open and inviting. 

&#8220;We could do this two ways,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You COULD fight me, but that would only make it more painful; or you could submit, allow me to fuck you, and it&#8217;ll go much quicker. The choice is yours. Either way, I get what I want." 

He moved around to face her again. 

&#8220;Now sit up on your knees.&#8221;

She rose and saw that Ethan had opened his pants. He was already erect.

"I&#8217;ve heard you&#8217;re good at suck cock. Open your mouth and show me." 

Amber knew she had no choice, so she parted her lips and closed her eyes. Ethan grabbed her by the hair, controlling her, but instead of the violation she expected, he gently pushed it into her mouth. 

Amber moaned. Her lips slid up and down the first two inches of his member, her tongue fondling the stiff muscle. His musky smell filled her nostrils. Opening her throat, she slid her lips further down until she reached his balls. Monique had instructed her well on how to manage the entire length of a man&#8217;s cock, while caressing it with her tongue and lips. She heard him moan, then she ran her hands up under his shirt and across his smooth chest. She withdrew her mouth a little and ran her nimble tongue around the tip, then fell upon it again like a starving woman, sucking vigorously. 

Ethan moaned again. Suddenly, he grabbed her by the hair and gently pushed her away.

&#8220;You&#8217;re not getting off that easily,&#8221; he gasped. &#8220;Stand up.&#8221;

Amber rose to her feet, and couldn&#8217;t help but smile a little when she saw that his face had lost some of its steely composure. 

&#8220;Just what the FUCK are you smiling at?&#8221;

Ethan turned red with anger and struck her again. He then grabbed her by the shoulder, spun her around and pushed her against the counter with the teppan in front of her. Using both hands, he pulled the top of her dress down to her navel. Amber&#8217;s heart was pounding now. He grabbed her breasts and squeezed them roughly, pinching her nipples, then he pushed her over the counter and held her there with one hand against her back. 

Amber made no effort to struggle, nor did she scream. She felt the smooth, metal of the grill pressing up against her naked breasts. Stretching her arms forward to the far end of the counter, she grasped the edge with both hands while Ethan yanked the skirt up over her thighs.

&#8220;Which will it be,&#8221; he said, &#8220;your cunt, or your ass?&#8221;

Without waiting for an answer, he chose the former. Amber cried out as he slowly pushed his cock all the way in while keeping her pinned down with the one hand. He began pumping his hips slowly, almost gently, but with the desire and passion in his balls, it didn&#8217;t take long before he was fucking her hard and fast. 

Through it all, Amber remained prone and bent over in complete submission, her breasts meshed against the hard metal as she was rocked again and again by Ethan&#8217;s thrusts into her body. She felt his hand leave her back. She heard the click of the heating dial. When Amber tried to move he pushed her down again, his hand pressing even harder now against her,

&#8220;I said don&#8217;t move!&#8221;

Ethan started to pump harder, his cock tearing into her vagina. The burner coils were directly underneath her breasts with the metal plate in between. Amber could feel the heat rising, but she still couldn&#8217;t bring herself to move. Squeezing her eyes shut, she grasped the edge of the counter in front of her even tighter until the knuckles in her hands turned white. Sweat beaded and rolled off her forehead. She tried to tell herself that this was just a game; that Ethan really didn&#8217;t turn the dial up that high, but as the temperature grew more and more intense, she began to fear the worst. Her arms, her chest, her back underneath his hand were sweating too, and it felt like the burners were starting to sear her flesh. Amber cried out,

&#8220;Sir . . . PLEASE . . . it&#8217;s burning me!

Ethan didn&#8217;t answer; he didn&#8217;t even seem to hear her. With a guttural groan, he grasped her hip with his free hand. She felt his erection throbbing inside her with a provocative rhythm, followed by the warmth of his release. Then Amber screamed, and this time it seemed to break his trance.

When he finally released her, she nearly leaped away from the metal plate, panting, her arms cradling her breasts. The skin around them was warm and red, but to her relief, there didn&#8217;t seem to be any burns. Even then, Ethan showed no concern; he only smiled as he zipped his pants,

&#8220;It&#8217;s better when there&#8217;s a little danger involved. Don&#8217;t you think?&#8221;

Before he turned the dial off, Amber noticed the temperature had been set to 450 degrees. She felt sick to her stomach.

&#8220;Now fix you dress and get back to work.&#8221;

After Ethan left, she went straight to Raven. Amber knew he would be furious, just as he was with Shane when he raped her in her cell. She had kept the incident to herself back then, and Raven whipped her when he finally found out. She wasn&#8217;t going the make the same mistake again, and hoped Ethan would suffer the same fate as Shane.

But when she informed Raven what had happened, there was no anger from him &#8211; in fact, he seemed amused by it.

&#8220;I told Ethan he could have a half hour with you,&#8221; he said, &#8220;though I can&#8217;t say I approve of what he did. That sort of reckless behavior could have damaged you permanently and cost me at least a hundred grand on the block. Are you sure you&#8217;re not burned? Perhaps we should have Monique take a look.&#8221;

&#8220;No, Sir,&#8221; Amber heard herself say, though her mind was lost in total disbelief. &#8220;I&#8217;m fine.&#8221;

&#8220;Good, then no harm done. I&#8217;m glad you reported it this time, even though it wasn&#8217;t necessary. At least now you know what to do now when someone violates what belongs to me without first asking for permission. Right?&#8221;&nbsp; 

&#8220;Yes, Sir.&#8221;

For Amber the walk back to the kitchen seemed much longer than usual after Raven dismissed her. The whole thing had been a test, and apparently she passed, but it didn&#8217;t make her feel any better about what Ethan did. She felt betrayed, though she couldn&#8217;t answer why she had a right to. She was a slave, and this sort of thing was to be expected. For the first time, she hated what was going on around her, and hated herself for not feeling this way earlier. 

As she moved through the dungeon toward the steps, she saw Isha again chatting and laughing with two men. Just six feet away, two more guests were tormenting Shawna, the girl with the gorgeous ringlets in her hair. She was locked in the &#8216;birdcage&#8217;, which was just that, a long narrow cage with a domed top that was actually suspended from the ceiling by a thick chain. Her wrists were fastened in the shackles at the top so that she too was almost suspended inside, her body stretched. The bars surrounding her allowed just enough room to accommodate the tight space, but there were also spikes along the length of it, all pointing inward. As Shawna hung there, naked and helpless, staggering on her toes, she did her best to avoid the sharp metal points jutting toward her from all sides, though she was not always successful, for the two guests were taking turns poking her through the cage with a small wired device that resembled an electric cattle prod.

For the first time since she could remember, Amber felt no fear, no thrill or even a blank acceptance with what she was witnessing. For the first time she was angry -- with the two guests tormenting Shawna, and with everyone in the room because they were all a part of it. 

When she finally reached the kitchen, Heidi was waiting for her, 

&#8220;Raven told me you needed some help cleaning this up.&#8221; 

Amber said nothing, but just looked at her. She couldn&#8217;t help admiring how exceptionally beautiful Heidi looked at the moment. Her golden hair had been taken up loosely in a bun, with wisps of stray curls hanging down at the ears to frame her lovely face. Her breasts were not only impressive in size, but also in the way they stood out on their own, and this was no less apparent then in the strappy, flesh-colored mini dress she now wore with its neckline plunging deep and loose in front almost down to her navel. Then she noticed the sponge in one hand, and in the other, a bottle of cleanser. That and the silver collar around her neck made Heidi suddenly appear almost comical, but Amber didn&#8217;t feel like laughing.

 &#8220;Is something wrong?&#8221; Heidi asked.

&#8220;Nothing&#8217;s wrong,&#8221; she answered flatly. 

The two women worked in silence until they were almost done with the kitchen, then Amber finally spoke up,

&#8220;About what we discussed today . . .&#8221;

&#8220;Yes?&#8221;

&#8220;I&#8217;m in.&#8221;

Chapter 26: Departures

Two days after Amber and Heidi made their pact, Amber asked Sonia if they could extend the garden they had been tending to get some spinach, broccoli, chard, and cauliflower planted before the summer was over. Everyone was pleased with what the girls had produced so far, including Sonia, so their head mistress approved the idea. Since there were no surveillance cameras, they could now plan their escape, but with a guard posted nearby they still had to be careful.

The next morning, they began breaking up the sod, and spoke in low whispers as they worked. They discussed the possibility of including one or two of the other girls at in their escape plot. Monique was immediately ruled out, as was the new girl, Cobie, who was still under close watch and too risky to approach. That left Livia, and here Amber and Heidi were split. Both of them liked her a lot and wanted to bring her with them, but Amber had reservations.

She remembered how Livia was a month ago &#8211; good-humored, lighthearted, and chatty -- almost to a fault, for her excessive talking often got her in trouble -- but in just a few short weeks, her behavior had changed drastically. She seemed dull and apathetic now, as if all the personality had been siphoned out of her and bottled it up somewhere. Occasionally, one might have seen sparks of her old self -- during her dance performances or when she was entertaining a guest -- but only when it was required of her. The rest of the time, she was just an empty shell of herself. Amber explained to Heidi that it was because of her training. 

ï¿½I think they finally got to her,ï¿½ she said, ï¿½Livia&#8217;s like Monique now, and if we tell her anything, then she might go to Raven.ï¿½

Heidi understood, and so in the end they decided it would be safer not to include anyone else.

Next, the girls had to figure out when to make their move. Heidi thought they should wait until the following week, when everyone would be put to work cleaning both the house and surrounding grounds. Len usually handed out the assignments, and Heidi was sure she could talk him into putting them both in charge of cleaning the slave quarters located in the dungeon. That way they could slip past the cameras, and then down to the wine cellar below where the tunnel was located. Amber agreed.

No matter how well thought-out the plan was, they both knew the chances of escape were slim to none. For one thing, it wouldn&#8217;t take long before someone discovered they were missing, and the girls had no idea how long it would take to get through the tunnel. Second, when (or if) they made it to the woods, it was going to be a long hike before they were safely away from Dark Oak Manor. All the same, they were ready to try. 

Once the new area was cleared of sod, Heidi broke up the clumps of soil while Amber added the peat and fertilizer. It was another hot and humid day, and their bodies were sweltering underneath their tunics. Heidi wiped her muddy hands on the grass, then took the water bottle and offered some to Amber after taking a drink. Their guard, Tony, was sitting under the gazebo about twenty yards from them, trying to stay awake.

ï¿½I hope they let us take a shower after this,ï¿½ Heidi said. ï¿½I feel like swamp rat.ï¿½

ï¿½Me too.ï¿½

Finally, the bell sounded from the house. 

ï¿½Time for lunch,ï¿½ Tony called out them from the shade. ï¿½Let&#8217;s get it picked up.ï¿½

The girls gathered all the tools together and put them in the wheel barrel, then rolled them toward the shed while Tony headed back up to the house to wait for them.

ï¿½You know . . . I&#8217;m tempted to make a break for those woods right now and forget about the tunnel,ï¿½ Heidi whispered as they walked. 

Amber understood what she was getting at. To the left of them, there was a small man-made creek that meandered through the back edge of the property, and about fifty yards beyond, the woods, with no wall or even a fence to keep them in. The idea really was tempting, but Amber knew better.

ï¿½That would be foolish, and you know it,ï¿½ she finally answered. ï¿½We wouldn&#8217;t get very far in the open like this. And besides, Monique told me they keep four bloodhounds and two Dobermans in a kennel nearby.ï¿½

ï¿½Have they ever used them?ï¿½

ï¿½Twice. Both times, a girl tried to make a run for it just as you said, and neither of them got very far. That&#8217;s why there are no fences around this place. Our best chance is that tunnel, and hopefully a VERY good head start.ï¿½ 

ï¿½You&#8217;re right.ï¿½

As they walked, a very large dragonfly buzzed right by them. Heidi watched it with a hint of jealousy in her eyes as it zigzagged and swooped down to the creek. Suddenly, she stopped dead in her tracks. Her eyes were wide as saucers now, and fixed on a small clearing that was almost hidden by cattails. When Amber turned her head in the direction Heidi was staring, she too froze. 

There was the body of a naked woman lying there in the grass along the creek bank. Amber raised one hand to shade her eyes and saw that it was Cobie, the new girl. She was blindfolded and lying face-up to the sun; her delicate limbs stretched wide and tethered to four wooden stakes that had been pounded into the ground. They both stared at her for a moment without saying a word. 

Gone now, were the soft, dark curls between her legs, for all the new girls were shaved immediately after their arrival to Dark Oak Manor. She moved only once -- a twist of her hand against its restraint. Her arm turned with it and brushed lightly, almost sensually against the short grass. The other arm, and one foot were stretched to a muddy sand bar next to the creek. She seemed to be completely immersed in her own suffering. Sweat shimmered off her pale body in the broiling mid-day heat, her moans grated with thirst, while sounds of sweet water lapping over the stones could be heard a mere few feet away. Though the mosquitoes were not out yet, there were plenty of smaller insects buzzing around her, a few regarding her as nothing more than a harmless landing pad.

As yet, Cobie had no knowledge of their presence, and Amber was thankful for it. She remembered seeing her the first night they brought her in. She was wearing a black cocktail dress that had been torn between her breasts. Her dark hair was lank with perspiration, her pallid face streaked with tears, and her eyes &#8211; Amber remembered the shear horror and disbelief, and a silent plea for help. She couldn&#8217;t bear to see that look again. 

ï¿½Let&#8217;s go,ï¿½ Heidi finally said in a low voice, and they continued on to the shed. ï¿½I wish we could bring that girl with us.ï¿½

ï¿½I do too, but it would be too risky.ï¿½ 

ï¿½Yeah, I know.ï¿½

They put the tools away in the shed, then Heidi slammed the door in anger, ï¿½I&#8217;ll say one thing though. When we DO get out, I&#8217;m going to blow the lid off this whole fucking organization!ï¿½

Amber said nothing. When the bell rang again, they hurried back to the house.


----------------


Raven was watching Heidi and Amber through the window in his office as they headed back to the house. He knew something was going on between those two, but he couldn&#8217;t figure out what it was.

ï¿½I guess I could beat out of them,ï¿½ he mumbled to himself in a low voice.

He was in a foul mood that day and ready to take it out on anyone. There was still no word from Jason as to Marco&#8217;s whereabouts, forcing him to suspend all operations, and that meant no money would be coming in after the two girls he was watching and the new one that had&nbsp; just arrived were sold off. Even worse, if the FBI had Marco, as everyone feared, then he would have to close up shop altogether. The walls around his little realm seemed to be crumbling, and at the moment, there was nothing he could do about it. 

After the girls entered the house, he sat down at his desk and thought about another order of business he had to deal with. 

His fourth girl, Livia, was finished with her training. That meant he would have to make arrangements to send her off to Lamar Quinn, and he hated that idea. The girl was a valuable piece of flesh, and guaranteed to fetch a top price at the next auction, but he had an agreement with Lamar. The last girl he sold him was most difficult, not that Jerri refused him, but she didn&#8217;t warm up to him either. One week later, Lamar finally stormed into the house and threatened to go to The Board if something wasn&#8217;t done about it. So Raven sent Jerri to a work camp in South America, and then gave Lamar a pick of the litter to make up for his loss. He chose Livia. 

Raven picked up his phone and paged Sonia, then he opened LIvia&#8217;s file:

Birth Date: September 7, 1978 
Height: 5&#8217; 6ï¿½
Weight: 110 lbs.
Hair: Blonde
Eyes: Green
 
Her entire record covering every stage of her training had been filled out down to the scheduled date she was to be sold at auction. Raven looked at her photo and smiled, then he took his pen and scrawled,

No auction. Sold to Lamar Quinn

Just then, Sonia&#8217;s voice came over the intercom. 

ï¿½You needed to speak with me?ï¿½

ï¿½Yes. Tomorrow we will be sending Livia to Lamar Quinn, so I&#8217;ll need you to arrange the transportation.ï¿½ 

ï¿½Yes sir.ï¿½

ï¿½But first, I want you to get her ready for a session with me in one hour. Cell 4.ï¿½

 ï¿½Yes sir.ï¿½

ï¿½And one more thing.ï¿½

ï¿½Yes?ï¿½

ï¿½Put a watch on Amber and Heidi.ï¿½

There was a pause, ï¿½All right . . . anything I should know about?ï¿½

 ï¿½Not just yet,ï¿½ Raven told her. ï¿½It might be nothing, but I want you to handle this one personally, then report to me if you see or hear anything suspicious.ï¿½&nbsp; 


----------------


In one hour, Raven was waiting for Livia in the dungeon. Cell no. 4 had no furniture, just a chain and pulley system in the ceiling above, and a metal wall cabinet that contained a wide variety of tools and implements used for bondage and torture. 

When the girl was brought to him, her body was draped in bright red slave silk that hung off one shoulder with a gold cord tied around her waist. She immediately assumed the proper position, sinking down to her knees, then leaning back on her heels while keeping her back straight, her chest out, head up, and her eyes to the floor. Raven had been with The Organization for more than twenty-five years, and it still astonished him how easy it was to transform any human being into a slave. 

Of course, the word &#8216;any&#8217; made his observation a bit of an overstatement. Not everyone&#8217;s thoughts and beliefs could be turned so easily against their will, but there were people in The Organization who were very efficient in finding the right candidates with submissive characteristics that could be tapped into and manipulated. Internet blogs and social networking websites were, by far, the best sources for collecting data because the contributors, particularly the women, were more open and honest about their thoughts and feelings. There were recruiters with backgrounds in psychology and social behavior whose job it was to establish relationships with these &#8216;targets&#8217;, and then there were computer hackers that could tap into their personal profiles and gather whatever information they could to establish a surveillance. 

Sometimes women were simply picked out of a crowd and shadowed by former private investigators. Livia was found this way, performing in a New York strip club. Generally, The Organization did not bother with these type of women. They were considered too independent for mind control, and since they were also exhibitionists by nature, the shock of &#8216;exposing&#8217; their bodies wasn&#8217;t as effective, and that aspect was critical in the first stages of their captivity and training. After some research, however, it was determined that Livia&#8217;s psychological make-up had strong submissive tendencies, making her a suitable candidate for indoctrination in spite of her profession.

The training, itself, was actually the easiest part of the whole process, but only after a long evolution of developing procedures to control human behavior, first inspired by a Russian scientist, named Pavlov. He discovered that you could condition a dog to salivate on command simply by associating food with the ringing of a bell, and when he carried out similar experiments on human beings, he came up with the same results. What few people knew about &#8216;Pavlov&#8217;s dogs&#8217; was that during a particularly severe rainstorm, his laboratories were flooded, and they were unable to reach his dogs until the floodwaters finally receded five days later. Upon returning, Pavlov discovered something truly remarkable. Before the flood, many of the dogs had been conditioned to respond to various stimuli, but after the flood, all traces of the conditioning in the dogs had disappeared! Bells, food, nothing could induce the former salivation response that had been so carefully implanted in the dogs' nervous systems.

What mysterious influence could account for this remarkable turn of events? Pavlov studied carefully what had transpired while he was away from the dogs. They had been left without food or warmth. They had been isolated for days. They had been subjected to extreme stress, never knowing if they would live or die. These were the factors that had produced the washing away of the previous conditioning from the dogs' brains. Pavlov and other Russians followed up this line of research, but it was the Chinese communists during the Korean War who first saw its real potential for use on human beings in spreading their propaganda.

Psychologists referred to it as &#8216;thought reform&#8217; or more commonly &#8216;brainwashing&#8217;. This technology of thought and behavior control was the whole blueprint of The Organization when it was secretly founded over 40 years ago. Since most human beings, even those who were submissive in nature, would never offer themselves unconditionally to be lifetime slaves, it became necessary to drastically reform their thought processes by using the most invasive form of influences developed by Pavlov, the Chinese and other sources. 

It required the complete isolation of new trainees from each other and the outside world; to restrict their eating to low protein food, foster sleep deprivation, control their basic daily needs, such as going to the bathroom, so that each trainee became entirely dependant on the will of the agent (or trainer). There were also the psychological influences &#8211; the physical and verbal abuse, sexual and emotional manipulation, and the propaganda methods used to &#8216;educate&#8217; them. All these influences were used to systematically break down the trainee's identity to the point that it wouldn&#8217;t function anymore. Once the slate was clean, the agent could then replace it with another set of behaviors, attitudes and beliefs that worked in the target's current environment.

But even under the most ideal brainwashing conditions, the effects of the process were most often short term, meaning that the old identity was not eradicated, but merely in hiding, and once the new identity stopped being reinforced, the person's old attitudes and beliefs would start to return. That meant a fully-trained slave&#8217;s thought processes still had to be reinforced after the training by her/his new master, and in many cases, sent back to a training facility periodically to be re-indoctrinated. 

Raven had no doubts that Livia&#8217;s new owner would send her back him for reinforcement, but it wouldn&#8217;t be the same, because once the ownership was transferred, she would no longer be his property to do what he wished. So for this last session, he was going to make the most of it.

She remained kneeling, her eyes to the floor while Raven opened the cabinet doors wide to display the assortment of implements hanging inside. He chose two pairs of leather cuffs, one for the wrists, one for the ankles, and tossed them deliberately on the table in front of her. Livia&#8217;s eyes darted up to them briefly, then back the floor. Her reaction was perfect &#8211; just a subtle expression of fear and nervous anticipation without breaking her posture. 

The girl was not beautiful in a classic sense, but exotic, yes. Her large, almond-shaped eyes were sea green and feline-like in appearance. Her nose wasn&#8217;t a pert upturned protrusion, but long, and together, with her sharply-chiseled jawline made the lower half of her face jut out in a most strikingly, unusual way. Her mouth was also too large for conventional standards, and her lips maybe a touch prominent, but she knew how to use them, as Raven could eagerly attest, having had first-hand knowledge of her oral skills. 

Raven surveyed the cabinet again until he found what he was looking for, and the only piece of equipment that Livia had yet to experience. Perfect for their last session together. He turned away from the cabinet so that she could see what he now held in his hand. Again her eyes darted up again, only this time her reaction was longer and not as subtle -- a nervous glance at the &#8216;violet wand&#8217; before looking away. 

Raven smiled, ï¿½Is something wrong, pet?ï¿½

ï¿½No, Master.ï¿½

ï¿½Come now,ï¿½ he was persistent. ï¿½You can speak freely.ï¿½

ï¿½I have always been of afraid of those, Sir,ï¿½ the girl was German, and the thick accent in her voice was just as striking as her appearance. 

ï¿½Well then, we&#8217;ll have to fix that, won&#8217;t we?ï¿½

Raven knew that any form of discipline involving electricity scared Livia, and her reaction was exactly what he liked to see in a woman, before demonstrating to her that the thing she feared the most was the very thing she needed. 

ï¿½Now stand up and release the silk so I can see you,ï¿½ he ordered.

Livia rose to her feet, and tried not to look at the wand, as she untied the cord belt and let the dress slide off her body to the floor. Standing nude before him, she obediently held her wrists in front of her so Raven could cuff them. 

Every line and curve of her body was perfect, her skin a pale tan, with no trace of hair under the arms, on the legs, or between them. The only mark on this beautiful canvas was the tribal symbol tattooed on her lower left hip that pointed to the smooth, pink cleft between her thighs. 

Raven fastened the second pair of cuffs to her ankles, then secured her wrist cuffs to a chain that hung down from the pulley assembly in the ceiling. He moved to a wall crank and turned the wheel. The gritty clicking sounds of grinding metal reverberated off the walls surrounding them as the chain inched upward, pulling her wrists with it, stretching her arms, then her long, willowy body until she was forced to stand on her toes. Only then, did Raven stop turning the wheel and flipped the latch to lock it in position. 

He went to the cabinet to retrieve one last item, a leather arm binder. He fastened the cuffs around each upper arm, so the strap that ran between them prevented Livia from bringing her head forward past her shoulders. It&#8217;s purpose was to keep a slave&#8217;s back straight, her head back and the front of her upper body thrust forward so it could be whipped or flogged without running a risk of striking her in the face. 

Raven darkened the room. Her face was almost hidden behind the strap, while the orange light from the remaining torch lapped over the rest of her body. Her breasts looked especially inviting, hanging high off her ribs with her arms raised, so much that he had to take some time to fondle them, and soon had her writhing off the chain and moaning. He teased her a bit and withheld any further attention until she silently begged for it. He then turned his attention to the wand and plugged the cord into a nearby outlet. 

The device, itself was a coil transformer encased a missle-shaped handle. On the end, a glass globe electrode attachment delivered a continuous stream of low current, high-frequency static electricity when held close to the skin. A dial on the handgrip offered a wide range of settings &#8211; from tiny, sensual burning sensations, much like a sparkler on Fourth of July, to more significant electrical shocks that could actually burn the flesh if held there too long. 

Again, Raven admired every curve of her naked body, now made stretched and available to him with her hands secured above her head. Livia then had to ask her Master politely to, ï¿½please torture me with electricity.ï¿½

And who was he to say &#8216;no&#8217; to such a request!

Turning on the switch, the transformer inside the wand crackled to life and the globe emitted a purplish glow as a backfill of gas filled the enclosed glass. He held the globe very close to her left nipple without touching it. Livia screeched as the current leaped from the globe to her flesh. Her body shuddered so much that Raven thought she would leap right out of her skin, but she didn&#8217;t move otherwise. He held the wand there for about six seconds and took it away. 

Livia&#8217;s nipples were already raised, cocked, bolt upright, and that was just from the lowest setting! He moved the globe down the length of her open arm and watched it crackle with purple light against her skin. The air started to fill with the smell of ozone. He turned up the power. The wand made a buzzing sound. This time the voltage was more intense, the sparks more visible, forcing Livia to twist, sway, and turn on the chain as he dragged the glowing wand up and down and around her body. Her movements reminded Raven of a grub worm dangling helplessly over a lit match. Every time he adjusted the setting, she would hear the buzzing sound and brace herself for what was to come. 

Then, at the highest setting, Livia started to scream. If it wasn&#8217;t for the resistance of the gas inside the bulb, and the glass enclosing it, then the current might have gone straight to her heart. He changed the attachments for different effects. Her body shimmered now with sweat all over. Her struggling grew more and more desperate, her twisting and turning, putting even more pressure on her strained arms. To culminate the scene, Raven used the most devious attachment of all, a metal probe. Raven allowed her a few moments of rest, and for her mind to focus on what was to come. He explained to her that the probe would be extremely painful and could potentially burn her flesh. Livia then, very sweetly and with an innocent thrust, offered him the beautiful flesh between her hips to do with what he pleased.

After he was finished, she hung limp off the chain from exhaustion. Angry burn marks criss-crossed every inch of her body, mapping trails that the wand had left in its wake. Raven, on the other hand, was relaxed, for Livia made him very happy that afternoon. He was proud of her and satisfied that she would serve her new Master well.


----------------


On the same evening Madam Isha performed her dance at Dark Oak Manor, Jason finally got a phone call from Marco. Almost two weeks had passed since his partner last reported in and his voice was clearly shaken, but Jason knew what to do. He listened patiently while Marco told him the whole story, which was clearly obvious by now &#8211; that, somehow, the FBI linked him to the Heidi Strobel kidnapping, and that his apartment had been searched and put under surveillance. He was very apologetic and tried to explain that he didn&#8217;t know for sure what was really happening until just a few hours ago, which was why he waited so long before calling in. It was a lame excuse, but Jason wasn&#8217;t surprised, or even angry. Marco was scared, and understandably more fearful of The Organization then he was of the Feds. Jason couldn&#8217;t blame him for that one, and now that contact had finally been made, he knew he had to handle this situation very carefully. 

He asked the obvious questions: Is there anything at your place that might link you to us? Any names or phone numbers written down? Did you tell anyone about what happened, inside or outside of The Organization? Has anyone followed you?

Marco answered a firm &#8216;no&#8217; to all his questions.

ï¿½All right,ï¿½ Jason&#8217;s voice was calm. ï¿½It looks like no major damage was done, but you know I&#8217;ll still have to make a report. You remember the procedure, don&#8217;t you?ï¿½

ï¿½Yeah, yeah I know . . . but do you think they&#8217;ll . . .ï¿½

ï¿½Just shut-up and listen,ï¿½ Jason interrupted him. ï¿½I can&#8217;t be sure how The Board is going to react to this, so don&#8217;t tell me where you are. I don&#8217;t want to know. Just stay put, a give me some time to work something out for you. OK?ï¿½

ï¿½OK.ï¿½

He then looked at his watch.

ï¿½Give me a call in exactly two hours from your location. I should have an answer for you by then. Got it?ï¿½ 

ï¿½Got it.ï¿½

ï¿½Good, and remember. Don&#8217;t panic. Running will only screw things up even more.ï¿½

ï¿½I won&#8217;t run . . . I promise.ï¿½

ï¿½Good. Remember, that&#8217;s two hours,ï¿½ then Jason hung up and took a long breath.

Of course, he was lying to Marco in not telling him that he had already reported everything to Raven, and that the Board was already informed of the matter. Shortly after, two men were sent to the apartment, and they confirmed the FBI surveillance. The important thing to do now was to make sure Marco stayed calm. The only way to do this was to let Jason handle everything directly, and to convince Marco that his partner could still be trusted. Without someone to turn to, the idiot might panic and skip the country, or even worse, run to the Feds. Both Raven and The Board were very wise in using this approach.

Jason picked up the phone again and booked a one-way flight to Mexico City for early the next morning. Then he opened an envelope and checked all the necessary documents &#8211; passport, birth certificate, drivers license, plenty of cash, and so on. He thought about calling Raven to tell him he had just made contact with Marco, and that the plan was under way. But after some careful thought, he decided to hold off on that for now, at least until the job was finished. 

So he waited for Marco&#8217;s call, and after two hours, Jason started to get nervous. During the next eight minutes he must have glanced at his watch twice as many times.

ï¿½Shit! That son-of-a-bitch took off!ï¿½

Then the phone rang, and Jason picked up the receiver.

ï¿½You&#8217;re late,ï¿½ he barked.

ï¿½Sorry . . . I-I just . . .ï¿½

ï¿½Shut-up and listen,ï¿½ Jason interrupted him again. ï¿½I booked a flight for you to Mexico. I also have the documents you&#8217;ll need, and some cash, enough to last you six months down there until you get settled in. The plan is for you to lay low for a year or so while we set up your new I.D.ï¿½

There was a sigh of relief on the other line.

ï¿½Of course, you realize your days of working in the field are over,ï¿½ Jason continued. ï¿½Even with your new I.D., Raven will want to keep you out of the public as much as possible. He&#8217;ll most-likely assign you as a handler, but that&#8217;s better than the alternative. Don&#8217;t you think?ï¿½

ï¿½Yeah . . . yeah, that&#8217;s fine. Thanks for the help. I owe you one,ï¿½ Marco answered him gratefully.

ï¿½Just stay low, and keep your ass out of trouble while you&#8217;re down there. I went out on a limb for you on this one.ï¿½

ï¿½Yeah, I know and I appre. . .ï¿½

ï¿½Tell me where you&#8217;re at, so I can get this stuff to you.ï¿½

ï¿½Checkpoint C.ï¿½

ï¿½Got it,ï¿½ Jason looked at his watch again. ï¿½Now listen carefully. Do you have a car?ï¿½

ï¿½No. It&#8217;s at my place. I&#8217;ve been on foot.ï¿½ 

ï¿½Anything in the vehicle that I should know about?ï¿½

ï¿½Nope. It&#8217;s clean.ï¿½

ï¿½Good. Now stay where your are and I&#8217;ll see you in forty-five minutes.ï¿½

Jason hung up without waiting for an answer. Then he grabbed the envelope and left his place.

It was almost midnight (about the same time Ethan Rom was getting &#8216;a taste&#8217; of Amber in the kitchen) when he pulled into an empty parking lot near the phone booth Marco had called from. His partner was waiting for him as instructed. He appeared to be much more relaxed now after the first phone call. Jason exited his car with the envelope in his left hand. The two men approached, smiling.

Marco drew a long sigh of relief, ï¿½Man, you&#8217;re a sight for sore eyes!ï¿½ 

Jason&#8217;s smile went away, and with his right hand, he pulled a gun out from under his coat and fired.

Marco never had a chance to defend himself. The bullet entered his forehead cleanly and sprayed a fine red mist as it exited from behind. His body landed on the asphalt with a hollow thud, and smoke from the gunpowder could be seen in the dim light of a nearby lamppost hovering over them.

Jason buried Marco that same night in a field with four gallons of lime - "Mafioso style" as they say. He had done exactly as told after Raven discussed the matter with The Board. Now he was to call in and make a final report.

But Jason had no intention of carrying out that last order. The flight reservation to Mexico had been made for himself; the documents too. Neither Raven, nor The Board knew anything about this part of the plan. Jason was convinced that he and his second partner, Dave, would be the next in line. He had no proof of this, and Raven certainly didn&#8217;t give him any reason to suspect, but it all made sense. They were the only two men with close links to Marco, and their lives certainly were not worth the gamble in exposing the entire organization.

On his way to the airport, Jason pulled off to another phone booth, and tried calling Dave. No answer, and that was the fourth try in two days. He couldn&#8217;t help smiling a little as he hung the receiver up. Dave was smart too, and probably had his own exit planned. Or worse, he might be spilling his guts to the Feds right at this very moment. Jason didn&#8217;t want to think about that one. Anyway, the whole thing was out of his hands now. 

He shut the door to the phone booth behind him, got into his car, and with a final check of his watch, sped off down the road, spraying gravel out from behind the tires.

Chapter 27: Red Silk Girl

Livia&#8217;s departure meant that Amber was next in line to be sold, assuming that her training continued as scheduled, and until now, there was no reason to believe otherwise. Her daily routine increased from two sessions to three, plus her dance sessions with Madam Isha, so life was busy and the days went by quickly. 

Amber&#8217;s slave status had also been promoted to &#8216;red silk&#8217; or Kajira, which meant she was experienced in Gorean decorum, customs, serving, dancing, and most importantly, sexual pleasures. A red silk was generally available to anyone who desired her usage, but since Amber was still in training, her availability was &#8216;restricted&#8217; and reserved solely by her current owner, Raven.

One of the first men to take advantage of her availability was Carlo Santos, who never owned a slave himself, but with his family&#8217;s inheritance, pumped a seemingly endless supply of revenue into Raven&#8217;s business. In fact, so frequent were his visits to Dark Oak Manor that no slave girl completed her training without having to open her thighs for him at least once. 

Ethan Rom was also interested and quickly drove down from New York with cash in hand. Since that night in the kitchen, Amber grew to fear and detest him more than anyone else in The Organization, but she did her best to make a good impression anyway. Her light chestnut hair was piled up on her head artfully. A shimmering blue satin dress hugged every curve of her body, her breasts pushed up and out of the scooped neckline. When Master Ethan arrived, their meeting was unceremonious, with no introductions made. He paid Raven off, then took her upstairs to one of the rooms and locked the door behind them.

&#8220;Take that dress off,&#8221; he ordered, &#8220;but keep the heels.&#8221;

Amber complied without hesitation. Grasping the tight skirt, she slowly pulled it up over her thighs. She had been taught the &#8216;proper way&#8217; to remove various articles of clothing for a client, so the flesh underneath could be bared in a teasing manner. As she raised her arms to slip the garment over her head, she made sure her spine was arched slightly forward so that her pointed breasts, would be thrust toward him. Once the dress was off, she held it out to her side, and let it slip from her fingers to the carpeted floor. Standing before him in only her heels, she remained motionless. When Ethan ordered her to turn, she did so in a slow circle as he stared brazenly at her naked body. 

Through it all, Amber had gone completely passive, as she always did with a client. She had learned to kiss back, to let them touch her however they pleased, and did not feel as bad about it anymore. Some situations were still problematic for her, such her sessions with Ethan, but she always did her best to suppress any aversions she had.

&#8220;Undo the hair . . .&#8221;

She raised her arms to unclip her hair, then with a shake of her head, let if fall loosely about her face and shoulders.

&#8220;That was a nice touch,&#8221; Ethan nodded his head in approval. &#8220;Now lie on the bed. Face down.&#8221;

Crawling slowly onto the bed, she let the front of her body sink into the plush, satin bedding while Ethan proceeded to stretch her arms and legs to the four posts and tether them. 

Moonlight from the window nearby poured over the back of her smooth, naked body. The sounds of creaking leather could be heard as she tried to wriggle her arms free, her actions slow and deliberate &#8211; another trick she had learned to keep a client engaged in the scene. In turn, Ethan had left just enough slack in the tethers to allow her some hope of escape while keeping her body spread-eagled and the prime target area open for teasing and play.

The ritual continued for several minutes, with Ethan observing as Amber struggled vainly with her restraints. Before long, she was completely immersed in her bondage, her thoughts focused inward. For a moment she had forgotten about Ethan, until she opened her eyes and saw him looking down at her. In one hand, he held a black scarf, in the other, a very large rubber cock, the like she had never seen before, mounted on a metal rod. 

Amber&#8217;s senses were immediately quelled by panic. There were knobbles and spikes covering the shaft of the cock right up to the tip, where a tapered steel spike, about two inches long, glittered coldly. Her eyes grew wide as saucers when she saw it.

&#8220;Just wanted you to see what I plan to fuck you with after I put this blindfold on,&#8221; he said.

Her eyes left it only to look into his eyes. As always, they were cold and gray. When he smiled down at her, the small gesture sent tidal waves of fear right through her body.

&#8220;Please, Sir . . . I . . .&#8221;

&#8220;Hold your tongue, or I&#8217;ll cut it off.&#8221;

Her calves tightened and flexed, her hips squirmed against the softness of the bed in a desperate effort to bring them together and cover the exposed and vulnerable region between her legs.

"Women have died on this," he said, holding it close to her face so she could not look away. &#8220;Not willingly, of course. They just keep fucking the thing until it tears them apart inside. It&#8217;s almost like they have to know how far, how deep they can let it go until finally it&#8217;s too late. That&#8217;s why you can&#8217;t be trusted to use it on yourself. Do you trust me?&#8221;

Amber nodded tentatively, &#8220;Y-yes, Sir.&#8221;

He lifted her head gently, placed the scarf over her eyes, and tied the knot behind her head, tightening it slowly, casually, until the blindfold was secured. 

Amber&#8217;s world was now thrust into blackness, though she could still picture clearly in her mind that large and hideous-looking thing with the spike on the end. Her ears strained almost painfully to pick up any sound of him. She even held her breath, as it interfered with her intense search for the slightest presence as he moved around the room.

At last, she felt his long fingertips parting the flesh between her legs, massaging her. The soft muscles in her buttocks clinched, her arms pulled against the restraints, but there was nothing she could do to stop him.

&#8220;Hold very still,&#8221; he commanded as he arrowed the steel point directly into her spread pussy.

Amber cried out, shocked by his abrupt movement and the stunning impact, and before the cry had fully left her throat, the rubber prick was almost halfway inside her. No build-up, no warning, no preamble &#8211; just firm, hard thrusts sinking deeper, greedily into her flesh, demanding that her supple, slippery tissues give way to the burrowing rubber device.

Her toes curled slightly, her fingers clawed out and retracted in a tight fist. Her heart began racing with the knowledge of the thing that was now violating her body. When she felt the semi hard spikes and knobs on the shaft massaging deep into her most tender places, she quickly forgot that dangerous spike at the top. Her pleasure was rising and that was all she cared about. She groaned as he came to the widest part of the dildo and started to fuck slowly.

There were about eight inches in her now and she knew that the tip of the spike was getting close . . . there . . . she gasped, eyes wide, but seeing only blackness, as she felt it against her cervix. She squirmed and tugged on the bindings. She rubbed her breasts against the smooth satin bedding to produce enough friction to keep her nipples stimulated. She wanted . . . needed more. She knew that would mean serious pain, maybe even death, but there was an itching deep inside her now, a burning need, and she knew Ethan wasn't going to stop, even if it meant turning her womb into mince meat.

She felt another prick and yelped, but the cock still kept moving forward and backward inside her, and each time the spike seemed to go a little further, though she couldn&#8217;t be sure.

Beads of sweat magically appeared on her body until the sheets were drenched underneath. When she climaxed, she screamed with both pain and pleasure, and when the pleasure melted away, there was only pain. All she felt now were the smaller protrusions along the shaft starting to shred her insides. Tears rolled down her cheeks from behind the blindfold. Suddenly, and again without warning, she felt the rubber cock slide out of her, but only to be replaced by his own. 

Her hips shifted restlessly on the bed, but she couldn&#8217;t throw him off her body. Not that she really wanted to. She trembled beneath him when he made a low growling sound of male satisfaction deep in his throat. 

Amber cried out sharply when he powered the full length on his hard cock in her with one stroke. He braced himself over her by grabbing the headboard, still buried in her to the hilt, his testicles pressing against the sensitive flesh between her legs.

&#8220;You&#8217;ve got the sweetest little cunt,&#8221; he whispered in her ear. &#8220;Fits me like a glove.&#8221;

He grimaced in pleasure when he moved, drawing out of her several inches and sliding back in. 

&#8220;There,&#8221; he said, fucking her slowly.

Amber&#8217;s eyes flickered back into their sockets as the thick ridge beneath the head of his cock stroked somewhere sublime.

&#8220;Your pussy loves my cock, doesn&#8217;t it?&#8221; he asked intently as he watched her and thrust with slow deliberation. &#8220;It shapes so tightly around it, squeezes me . . . taunts me.&#8221;

Amber panted. She bit her lip and groaned. The bed began to beat against the wall from Ethan&#8217;s short, yet forceful thrusts. Then her eyes flashed open at the sudden cruel deprivation of his cock sliding out of her, and the sounds of his hand pumping the glistening rod. He groaned at the same moment that his seed shot across both cheeks of her buttocks, thick and abundant. The scent of semen reached her flared nostrils. Her womb constricted in an agony of desire. 

When it was over, Ethan untied her, then tossed her a towel to wipe herself with and told her to get dressed. More than an hour later, she was still in pain, but after a quick examination from Monique, it was determined that no permanent damage had been done.

&#8220;You were lucky,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I heard Master Ethan once killed a girl with that thing.&#8221;

Amber didn&#8217;t feel so lucky. She knew Ethan would be back, and that there would be others like him, or maybe worse. She began to wonder what might happen to her after she was sold at the next auction. She thought of Colleen, whose neck was accidently broken during a session with her Master. She imagined the poor girl hanging there in some kinky leather restraint, her body naked for everyone to see, her face blue and her milky, lifeless eyes bulging from their sockets. 

Amber was determined not to suffer a similar fate. Before, she had reservations about going into the tunnel with Heidi and gamble with what little of her life remained. Now she was ready to risk it all.


----------------


Raven sat up straight in his bed when he heard his phone ring in the middle of the night. He switched on the table lamp and checked his watch. It was 2 a.m. He knew this couldn't be good news. It never was at this hour. 

He picked up the receiver on the third ring.

&#8220;Hello?&#8221;

&#8220;It&#8217;s me.&#8221;

Raven recognized Jason&#8217;s voice immediately. &#8220;Where in HELL have you been?&#8221;

&#8220;Looking for our friend,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Just wanted to call in my report.&#8221;

Raven knew Jason was speaking of Marco and braced himself for the news, good or bad. 

&#8220;Go on . . .&#8221;

&#8220;It&#8217;s all taken care of.&#8221;

&#8220;He&#8217;s gone?&#8221;

&#8220;That&#8217;s right.&#8221;

&#8220;And was he clean?&#8221;

&#8220;Yeah, he was clean. He said he didn&#8217;t talk to anyone else, and I believe him.&#8221;

&#8220;Good,&#8221; Raven almost breathed a sigh of relief, but then caught himself, because he didn&#8217;t want Jason to hear him on the other end. &#8220;You&#8217;ll get a hefty bonus for this one, my friend. I&#8217;ll need you to come straight in. No stops, understood? Then you and I will bring this to The Board personally.&#8221;

&#8220;I&#8217;m not coming in.&#8221;

&#8220;What?&#8221; 

&#8220;I said I&#8217;m not coming in.&#8221;

&#8220;What are you talking about?&#8221; 

&#8220;Listen carefully,&#8221; Jason spoke slowly, &#8220;because I don&#8217;t want to stay on this line any longer than I have to. I did this dirty little job for you only because Marco was on my team, and therefore, my responsibility. I owed you and The Board that much, but things have changed now.&#8221;

&#8220;Listen, I&#8217;m giving you an order . . .&#8221;

&#8220;You and I both know what could to happen to me if I follow that order.&#8221;

&#8220;Where are you?&#8221; 

&#8220;And you know better than ask to me a question like that.&#8221;

Raven knew it was no use in trying to convince Jason to come in. The man wasn&#8217;t as naive as Marco, and understood the system all too well.

&#8220;Well can you at least tell me where your other man is?&#8221; Raven was speaking of Dave.

&#8220;I honestly have no clue. Probably doing the same thing I&#8217;m doing. Saving his own ass.&#8221;

&#8220;You DO realize they&#8217;ll order me to send someone after you two.&#8221;

&#8220;That wouldn&#8217;t surprise me, but at least this way I have a chance.&#8221;

&#8220;Look, my friend,&#8221; Raven closed his eyes and squeezed them tight. His next words needed to be chosen very carefully. &#8220;I understand how you feel, but you really don&#8217;t have to do this. No one is blaming you for what happened, and you&#8217;re too valuable an asset for us to lose. Furthermore, The Board appreciates what you&#8217;ve been doing to fix everything and I&#8217;m promise you . . . &#8220;

&#8220;I&#8217;m sure they appreciate it,&#8221; Jason broke in, &#8220;and I&#8217;m sure they&#8217;ll be happy with how things have turned out for their business interests, but it still won&#8217;t change a thing. To them, I&#8217;m a risk, a liability. That means I can&#8217;t trust anyone . . . even you. I have to do what&#8217;s best for me now, and you and The Board will have to take my word that I won&#8217;t you sell out &#8211; that is, as long as you leave well-enough alone. Do you understand?&#8221; 

&#8220;Yes, but . . .&#8221;

Then he hung up.

Raven cleared the line on his phone and immediately called in to set up a meeting with The Board of Directors. That took only five minutes. After hanging up the receiver, he glanced down at Isha lying in bed beside him. She was still asleep, her arms draped above her head over the pillow, and crossed at the wrists, as if mimicking an act of bondage. His eyes traced the line where the sheets were folded back neatly across her firm breasts, then down the shadowed valley between them before they disappeared underneath.

She looked splendid against the burgundy silk, her creamy skin bathed in the dim light from his open window, her long amber hair cascaded around her in a dark pool, but she always had a way of doing that -- turning the mundane into the wonderful, and vice versa.

Raven sat there silently in the dark for a few minutes, watching her, then finally got up and grabbed his robe. No use in trying to get any more sleep that night. He was wide a wake, and still had some work to do.

&#8220;Was that the phone?&#8221; Isha suddenly called out to him, her eyes still heavy from sleep.

&#8220;Yes.&#8221;

&#8220;At this hour? Who was it?&#8221;

&#8220;Wrong number.&#8221;

There was a loud, hollow creak as the door at the top of stairs suddenly opened. Crouched on their knees in front of the entrance to the tunnel, Amber and Heidi froze in the act of trying to insert a hairpin into the lock. The candle sitting on the floor next to them fluttered when the door closed again, followed by the sound of someone descending the steps.

Amber quickly leaned forward and snuffed the flame out. They exchanged wide-eyed glances, listening to the footfalls reach the bottom step. Somewhere down the corridor a light came on, and with a gathering sense of dread, they waited, hoping that whoever it was had merely come down to retrieve something from one of the other rooms. After a long silence, the footsteps were heard again, this time climbing back up the stairs. The door to the dungeon opened and closed, then silence. Both women breathed a sigh of relief.

&#8220;That was close,&#8221; Heidi said. &#8220;Light the candle again.&#8221;

&#8220;OK, but hurry up before somebody else comes down here.&#8221;

Heidi slowly inserted the flattened hairpin into the lock again, and then she began turning it clockwise while applying some pressure. It was her third attempt. 

&#8220;I thought you said you could do this,&#8221; Amber said impatiently.

&#8220;I can, but this lock hasn&#8217;t been opened in awhile and the mechanisms inside aren&#8217;t moving.

&#8220;Try jiggling it.&#8221;

&#8220;You CAN&#8217;T just jiggle it, or else the pin might break off inside.&#8221;

Both of them could feel the adrenaline pumping through their veins. Just beyond the locked door was the tunnel and freedom, yet behind them, lurked the ever-present danger of being discovered. Amber didn&#8217;t want to even think about what Raven might do if they were caught in this damning position. 

&#8220;Hurry . . . &#8220;

&#8220;I got it!&#8221; Heidi&#8217;s raised voice echoed with excitement.

&#8220;Shhhhhhhh . . .&#8221;

The lock clicked open. Heidi released it, and both of them had to pull on the door until it finally opened with a gritty moan. 

The tunnel measured about four feet square, its walls lined with ancient stones sealed roughly together with mortar, some crumbling in places. Amber and Heidi peered into the gaping obscurity that lay in front of them. The candlelight reached only six feet or so, and beyond that, they could see nothing. Knowing that she was about to venture into it sent a shiver up Amber&#8217;s spine and the goose bumps rising on her arms. 

&#8220;I&#8217;m NOT going in there,&#8221; she said.

Heidi leaned in and stretched her arm and the candle forward as far as she could. The blackness receded about four more feet and that was all.

&#8220;I&#8217;ll admit, it doesn&#8217;t look promising . . . but we can&#8217;t turn back now.&#8221;

&#8220;How do you know this even leads into the woods?&#8221;

&#8220;I told you what this tunnel was used for, so it only makes sense that it leads outside somewhere.&#8221;

&#8220;But this door looks like it hasn&#8217;t been opened in years. Maybe decades.&#8221;

&#8220;I&#8217;m going,&#8221; Heidi held the candle in front of her again and began to crawl inside. &#8220;Make sure you close that door behind me and lock it.&#8221;

Amber wondered if Heidi was being brave or just rash, but she did get them this far. She had talked Len into assigning them both to cleaning the dungeon while everyone else was working either in the house or the surrounding grounds outside. Once they were alone, they were able to slip past the surveillance cameras and sneak down the narrow steps to the lower level where the tunnel was located. Not surprisingly, the door had been padlocked, but Heidi found a way around that too, armed with just a hairpin. 

Amber glanced over her shoulder at the doorway. She thought about abandoning this whole idea and heading back upstairs before it was too late, but then she would have to face Raven once he found out that her friend was missing. 

Heidi was right about one thing. There was no turning back now, so Amber took a long breath and followed her into the tunnel.


----------------


When Raven ordered Sonia to keep an eye on Amber and Heidi, she thought he was just over-reacting, until that morning, when she found out Len had switched their work assignments at the last minute, then she too, became suspicious. She went down to the dungeon. When the girls were nowhere to be found, she tried the wine cellar next. That was when Amber and Heidi heard the footsteps descending the stairs. Had Sonia noticed the candle before Amber snuffed it out, or even bothered to check all of the rooms, she would have undoubtedly caught both of them in the act. 

But that didn&#8217;t happen. Seeing the whole lower level dark and apparently empty, Sonia immediately went back up to search the rest of the house. For now, the girls had time to make their escape, but not much.


----------------


Amber could almost feel the inky blackness closing in on them like a suffocating cloak. The tunnel had narrowed until it was just wide enough for them to squeeze their shoulders through. Heidi was in front, urging her on, and holding the only candle that lit their way.

&#8220;It can&#8217;t be much further . . .&#8221; 

&#8220;You said that ten minutes ago.&#8221; 

Amber was shivering in her tunic. The moist air seemed to cling to her body underneath. Black water trickled like snails down the rocks that formed what was left of the walls. Every time it dripped in her hair, it felt like an icy finger reaching out to touch her. 

Then suddenly, just as she thought their situation couldn&#8217;t have been any worse, a large rat darted out in front of her, it&#8217;s spiky nose twitching. Amber screamed and the rat scurried into a hole where part of the wall had crumbled away.

&#8220;What is it,&#8221; Heidi called back.

&#8220;There are RATS down here!&#8221;

&#8220;I know,&#8221; she said calmly. &#8220;I saw one earlier. Just stay clear of them and they won&#8217;t bother you.&#8221;

&#8220;And how am I supposed to do that when I can barely move?&#8221;

Heidi kept crawling without offering a reply, and since she was holding the candle, Amber had no choice but to follow. Feeling the panic welling up inside, she tried to keep her eyes on Heidi and nothing else. There were muffled sounds of water dripping slowly in the distance, and now and then, the squeak of rats put the hairs on the nape of her neck on end. 

Heidi, on the other hand, didn&#8217;t seem bothered by it much, or at least she wasn&#8217;t showing it. Through the open sides of her tunic, Amber could see her naked breasts swaying heavily underneath, hard nipples brushing against the fabric whenever she moved just in the right way. She was arguably one of the most attractive and enticing women ever to have been brought to Dark Oak Manor, and that was probably the sole reason why Raven, as yet, hadn&#8217;t shipped her away to one of the work camps in South America. She had been a problem in the start, and after several weeks of training, her mind still wasn&#8217;t right. Now Amber was putting all her trust in this woman getting her out and away from Raven&#8217;s grasp, but if they failed, the punishment would be unimaginable, and in the end, she too would be sent away. 

Ahead of them, a section of wall had slid open, leaving a gaping obscurity and a pile of earth in their path. Heidi set the candle down and carefully climbed over the mound of earth. Amber did the same, then paused a minute to wipe off her muddy hands on her tunic.

&#8220;So why did they call this the Underground Railroad?&#8221; she asked Heidi, not out of any particular interest, but as a means to divert her mind from their miserable surroundings.

Heidi understood what Amber was trying to do, and offered an answer that was lengthy and more detailed than necessary. 

&#8220;Before the Civil War, there was a vast network of people helping fugitive slaves escape to the North and Canada. I think it began with the Quakers back in the eighteenth century, and then as the system grew, it was dubbed &#8216;The Underground Railroad&#8217; after the steam railroads, which were just emerging then. The homes and businesses where fugitives would rest and eat were called &#8216;stations&#8217; or &#8216;depots&#8217; and run by &#8216;stationmasters,&#8217; those who contributed money or goods were &#8216;stockholders,&#8217; and the &#8216;conductor&#8217; was responsible for moving fugitives from one station to the next. This house was once a part of all that, and the irony of it still hasn&#8217;t ceased to amaze me.&#8221; 

&#8220;Me neither,&#8221; Amber cringed when she saw another rat scamper past. &#8220;So how did you become such an authority on all of this?&#8221;

&#8220;I&#8217;m a high school phys-ed teacher, and sometimes I also taught history . . . HEY . . . I think I see a light up ahead!&#8221;

&#8220;Thank God.&#8221;

Both women quickened their pace until they finally reached the opening -- only to discover that a gate now blocked the entrance. Beyond it, they could see the woods and even a road in the distance.

&#8220;Dammit! Now what?&#8221;

&#8220;It&#8217;s padlocked, like the door inside the house,&#8221; Heidi pulled the pin out of her hair. &#8220;Give me a minute and I&#8217;ll have it open.&#8221;

She carefully maneuvered the hairpin inside the keyhole of the lock, but this one had been rusted through so that even a key couldn&#8217;t open it now. Heidi slammed the gate with her fist and cursed. Both women sat there on their knees, staring out through the rusty grate. Neither of them said a word for quite some time. 

Then Heidi ran her hand along the frame of the gate where it had been bolted into the wall. She grasped it and shook as hard as she could. The bolt seemed to move a little within the rock. 

&#8220;Look how soft the wall is here,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I bet we could force these bolts out.&#8221;

&#8220;With what . . . a jackhammer?&#8221;

&#8220;Very funny,&#8221; Heidi searched around her for anything sharp, and found nothing. &#8220;Maybe I can smuggle a kitchen knife or something next time.&#8221;

&#8220;Next time?&#8221;

&#8220;That&#8217;s right. We&#8217;re going to wait another night and try this again.&#8221;

Amber didn&#8217;t share Heidi&#8217;s optimism. 

&#8220;In that case, we better go now before they miss us,&#8221; was her only answer.

The long trek back through the tunnel was even more miserable after their hopes had been dashed. When they finally got back into the wine cellar, they carefully closed the door and locked it.

&#8220;What do we do about our tunics,&#8221; Amber gasped. &#8220;They&#8217;re filthy and so are WE!&#8221;

&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry,&#8221; Heidi slipped out of hers and wiped the mud off her arms and legs with it. &#8220;There are some clean ones in that cabinet by the steps. We can change into those, and I&#8217;ll just slip these in with the dirty laundry. No one will ever know.&#8221;

After taking a quick shower, they dressed and finally resumed their chores. Len came down to check on them, and after he was satisfied, went back upstairs again. Amber finally began to relax, and believe they had actually gotten away with it.

Later that night, she woke up to the sound of a key turning in one of the cell doors. Amber had no idea what time it was, for there were no clocks or windows in the rooms where the slaves were kept at night. She heard the door open and a brief exchange of voices. She couldn&#8217;t make out the words, but it sounded like they were coming from Heidi&#8217;s room. The door closed again, followed by a trail of footsteps fading down the hall, then silence.

It wasn&#8217;t uncommon for them to come for a slave in the middle of the night, but Amber was sure they were taking Heidi to interrogate her about the tunnel. She lay there, naked on her bed, her heart pounding, against her breasts and waited for them to come for her next, but nothing happened. Finally, sleep overtook her again, and she dreamed like always since her captivity, only this one was more vivid and terrifying than any nightmare she had experienced so far . . .

Her eyes flew open to the wailing sounds of a train whistle. Looking up, she stared, almost hypnotized with disbelief into a nightmarish hell of blackened hot metal, glowing cinders and dripping grease. Amber was no longer in her bed, but under a steam engine sitting directly above her, and she wasn&#8217;t laying on the tracks, but tied them! Someone had bound her wrists and ankles to the rails, her body stretched between them on the wooden cross ties.

She frantically looked around, and from under the train she saw dozens of feet moving back and forth along the platform. She tried to call out to them, but it seemed that no one could hear her screams through all the noise.

So she began twisting her arms against the ropes, and then made another horrible discovery &#8211; the engine, itself, sat high enough off the tracks so as to miss her completely if it should move, but her bound wrists and ankles were lying directly across the rails, just in front of the six massive iron wheels. She desperately began pulling and jerking her limbs against the ropes, but they were hopelessly pinned. 

The engine came to life again, blowing its whistle, hissing steam and throwing water from its flanks. Hot water dripped from the steam tubes, hoses and open lines. Amber was also feeling the heat, her body glistening from her own sweat. Everyone scattered onto the train until the platform was empty. Then she heard a voice to her left,

&#8220;YOU BLEW IT, PET!&#8221;

It was Raven, standing on the a-joining tracks and peering under the engine, smiling. 

&#8220;I trusted you and you betrayed that trust. NOW YOU HAVE TO PAY THE PRICE.&#8221;

Amber tried to call out to him, but he suddenly disappeared in the billowing steam.

She was alone, but not for long. More people appeared on the platform, at least thirty or forty, only these passengers were all walking in a single line and chained together by steel shackles around their ankles. Their legs were naked and shoeless, and dark, almost black. Amber heard mumblings among them, but in languages she couldn&#8217;t understand. There was the loud crack of a horsewhip, followed by someone shouting,

&#8220;Quit that jabbering and stay in line!&#8221;

Amber saw one of the slaves was white, and female. Her legs were long and smooth with beautifully shaped calves. Her dirty tunic barely covered her thighs. When she fell, Amber wasn&#8217;t surprised to see that it was Heidi.

&#8220;On your feet, BITCH!&#8221; The whip cracked again.

With a yelp, Heidi stood up and started walking. Amber watched helplessly as the slaves shuffled past, the chains rattling between them. Once they were all aboard, the steam whistle blew one last time with long loud, WWHEEEEEEEYOOOOOOOOOOO!!!! 

Amber began struggling with the ropes again. She yanked as hard as she could, but they wouldn&#8217;t budge and inch. Her dainty wrists and ankles were still lying across the rails, still in the path of the engine&#8217;s massive wheels. 

A loud crash sounded, the train finally lurched forward. The air was thick with soot, nearly choking her with every breath, but Amber still managed to scream . . .

Indoctrination

Chapter 29: Chairwoman of the Board

Truscott Marketing and Public Relations was an unrenowned company located on the 28th floor of a nondescript building in Manhattan. There were no clients, no vendors, and very few visitors even stepped off the elevator at this level. Every office was kept locked overnight, and after hours the cleaning people were instructed to cover only the common areas. The reason for this obscurity and secrecy was that Truscott, from the beginning, had been set up as a front company for The Organization. It was here where the Board of Directors held their meetings and made decisions that affected most of the operations all around the globe.

Raven stood alone in the elevator, the clicks of the flashing numbers above the door marking his upward progress to floor 28. When the doors opened, Jillian Rideout was waiting for him. A petite, but average-looking woman, she was dressed very conservatively in a gray skirt and blazer. An armed security guard stood next to her, and his appearance seemed to clash with the professional look of his companion. He had a husky build, stone face, and a prizefighter&#8217;s broken nose.
 
&#8220;Good afternoon, Sir,&#8221; Jillian smiled warmly. &#8220;Ms. Ingram would like to meet with you in her office. This way please.&#8221;

Raven nodded and followed her down the long, dim corridor with the guard close behind. They approached a pair of double doors at the end, and the guard seemed to melt away into the shadows as the girl&#8217;s hand touched the doorknob. When the doors opened, light spilled out from the large reception area. 

&#8220;Please have a seat, and I&#8217;ll let her know you&#8217;re here. Coffee?&#8221;

Raven politely said &#8216;no&#8217; and remained standing, glancing at his watch impatiently. The board meeting had been scheduled to begin in ten minutes, but the entire floor was strangely quiet with no sign of any members. Glancing around the room, his thoughts were suddenly interrupted by something he saw through the open double doors to an a-joining office. 

The room was bare with little furniture to speak of, only a wheel and pulley assembly that had been set up on the carpeted floor. The chain ran up to the ceiling and down again in front of a large window that spanned the opposite wall. On the other end of the chain, a naked man hung, spread-eagled and upside down with the front of his body almost touching the glass.

Raven couldn&#8217;t help but smile and immediately knew who put him there. Katherine Ingram may have been the head of the board, but she was also once a mistress, one of the best in his opinion, and it was good to see that she hadn&#8217;t lost her passion for games.

The slave&#8217;s ankles were cuffed to the ends of a long spreader bar fastened to the chain, his wrists chained to the floor so that his powerful limbs formed the shape of an X. Beyond the window, the entire city of Manhattan was laid out like a tapestry, with the traffic mayhem crawling every direction 28 floors below, and the sun gleaming like a fiery ball down through the heated glass, and on him.

Even from where he stood, Raven&#8217;s keen eyes could see from the reflection in the window that the slave was sporting an impressive hard-on. From there, he saw the wires trailing down to a black box. The device was called a Stimulator &#8211; a favorite among members of The Organization for male torture. Two copper rings, one for the testicles and one for the penis, served as conductors that allowed the electrical currents to pass into the body. Controls on the box could be adjusted to inflict the most excruciating pain imaginable or, as in this case, dialed down to induce and maintain an erection for long periods of time.

Kate always came up with the most exquisite forms of restraint. Like Raven, she was a lifestyle Dom. She was resolute, intelligent, ambitious, and there were few men in the world to which she would submit or subordinate herself. Her qualities were impressive enough to attract the attention of The Board and appoint her, at the age of 35, to the most powerful position within The Organization. 

If Katherine had any fault though, it is her over-optimism and over-confidence. She wasn&#8217;t greedy like the others, but she believed that the people around her were better and more rational than they really were, and that she could accomplish more than any one person possibly could achieve. 

A soft grown drew Raven&#8217;s attention back to the inverted body hanging in front the window. He had no sexual proclivities for men, but nonetheless, was impressed with the scene. The slave had a magnificent physique -- well muscled, well tanned with no hair on the body but the scalp -- just how Kate liked them. He moaned again and pulled helplessly against the chains, the tight muscles in his back, limbs and buttocks clenched and quivered. Sweat glistened off his smooth skin as the glaring sun bore down on him through the pane of glass. The strain of being suspended was finally taking effect, or perhaps it was the constant flow of low-voltage electricity feeding into his genitals, forcing his cock to remain stiff and throb with no hope of relief. 

&#8220;Ms. Ingram will see you now,&#8221; Jillian Rideout announced, and with some disappointment, Raven turned from window and followed her back into the office.

Katherine Ingram stood up from behind her desk and walked around to greet Raven as he entered. She wore a tight gray skirt of an office suit and a blouse of transparent white cloth tailored like a man&#8217;s shirt. The blouse flared out above her waistline, stressing the trim flatness of her hips, and as she moved in front the large window behind her desk, Raven could see the slender silhouette of her body with the flaring circle of the blouse.

&#8220;How are you, Raven,&#8221; she said smiling. &#8220;Forgive me for keeping you waiting. Please sit down.&#8221;

&#8220;Was the meeting canceled?&#8221;

Katherine paused a moment, then smiled before taking her seat, &#8220;Yes, at the last minute. I&#8217;m sorry you had to make this drive up for nothing.&#8221;

&#8220;That&#8217;s quite all right, I like New York,&#8221; he lied. &#8220;So what happened?&#8221;

&#8220;The Board felt this situation wasn&#8217;t urgent enough to hold a formal meeting. 

&#8220;Not urgent enough?&#8221;

&#8220;That&#8217;s right. I did hold a conference call with the executive directors this morning. We discussed your report and your concerns about any possible breeches in security.&#8221;

Raven immediately knew what was coming.

&#8220;We concluded that every effort must be made to find those two missing men, but to resume all operations as soon as possible. The rest of the members and shareholders are being notified of our decision.&#8221;

&#8220;And what about the feds?&#8221;

&#8220;You said they were only after the third man . . .&#8221; she paused a moment to put on her glasses and read the report, &#8220;Marco Sanchez . . . and that he was eliminated, correct?&#8221;

&#8220;That&#8217;s what Jason told me over the phone, but unless he comes in, we can&#8217;t confirm this.&#8221; 

&#8220;And now he and his partner are in hiding also.&#8221;

&#8220;That&#8217;s right, at least Jason is. I haven&#8217;t heard from Dave Roberts yet, but I think it&#8217;s safe to assume he&#8217;s not coming in either. I guess they thought they would be the next to go and I can&#8217;t blame them. That&#8217;s why we need to shut down all operations until these men are brought in and questioned. Maybe then, we&#8217;ll know how much more the feds have uncovered, if anything.&#8221;

&#8220;I understand you&#8217;re concern, Raven, but the shareholders have been all over my ass over this.&#8221;

&#8220;And it&#8217;s such a pretty ass,&#8221; Raven couldn&#8217;t resist the remark.

&#8220;Very funny, but let&#8217;s be serious. Every day we don&#8217;t do business is another day we lose money.&#8221;

&#8220;If the feds find out, we&#8217;ll lose a lot more than that.&#8221;

&#8220;The Board doesn&#8217;t think so. They believe this man, Marco, was the only lead they had, and now he&#8217;s gone. Problem solved.&#8221;

&#8220;And you agree with them?&#8221;

&#8220;Yes, I do.&#8221;

Raven leaned forward in his chair, &#8220;Come on, Kate. They&#8217;re businessmen, an entirely different breed than you and I. There&#8217;s no discretion, no code of conduct. Most of them have never trained or even owned a slave. All they care about is profit, and in the end, their greed is going to sink this whole organization.&#8221;

Katherine got up and slowly circled around the desk, her mind deep in thought. Raven watched as she moved. She was intense, like any powerhouse businesswoman, and not attractive in a conventional way, but in a unique and unusually striking way. Her face was made of angular planes, the shape of her mouth, clear-cut, a sensual mouth, held closed with inflexible precision. Her hair was tied neatly and professionally behind her head, but with just a single strand falling across one side of her face, which at the moment, made her look very appealing. 

She leaned against the edge of the desk only a few feet from Raven. Her legs, sculptured by the tight sheen of the stockings, the long lines running straight down behind, past the back of each knee to a high-heeled pump, had a feminine elegance that seemed oddly incongruous with the rest of her.

 &#8220;So tell me about these two men,&#8221; she took off her glasses. &#8220;What do you think they&#8217;ll do?&#8221; 

&#8220;Both of them have been very loyal to The Organization. Jason is more independent and he despises authority, but I also know he hates the FBI more than anything. I think he&#8217;ll stay where he is as long as we leave him alone. Dave on the other hand, might get tired of hiding and may be more inclined to come out and strike a deal with the feds. He is the one I&#8217;m worried about.&#8221;

&#8220;Good assessment,&#8221; Katherine nodded with approval, &#8220;but I always thought it would be Jason, for the same reasons you just stated.&#8221;

&#8220;In the end, going the FBI would be the smart move, and Dave was always smarter.&#8221;

&#8220;We&#8217;ll certainly take that under advisement.&#8221;

Katherine suddenly stood up from the desk, signaling that the meeting was over. As they left her office, she grabbed an ivory handled crop off a credenza near the door. The naked man was still suspended in the window; his cock still bobbing away, only now, streams of dried cum covered the glass in front.

&#8220;One of my assistants,&#8221; Katherine smiled, &#8220;only he&#8217;s been a very bad boy.&#8221;

Raven grinned back knowingly, &#8220;One of the hazards of his job, I guess.&#8221;

She thrust out her hand to shake his, &#8220;Again, I apologize for the trip you had to make, and I wouldn&#8217;t worry about those two men. We&#8217;ll handle it. Just let me know if they contact you again.&#8221;

&#8220;I will.&#8221;

&#8220;Ms. Rideout will show you out.&#8221;
 
&#8220;No need. I know the way.&#8221;

After Raven turned for the elevators, he glanced past his shoulder one last time and noticed that Katherine had not gone back into her office, but to the other room where the slave was waiting, the crop still in her hand. When she closed the door behind her, Raven smiled again before continuing down the hall.

By the time he reached the elevators, the grin had gone away as his thoughts turned to the conversation they just had.

Chapter 30: The Furies

While Amber and Heidi were making their way through the tunnel, Sonia had been searching the whole house for them. She found Cobie, cleaning the bathrooms and Monique in the dining room. Neither had seen the other two girls, so she went to the stables next to talk to Len.

&#8220;Did you put Amber and Heidi to work in the dungeon?&#8221;

Len nodded sheepishly. 

&#8220;Wasn&#8217;t that Monique&#8217;s assignment?&#8221;

&#8220;Well . . . I decided to change . . .&#8221;

&#8220;You mean Heidi talked you into changing it for her,&#8221; Sonia interrupted, &#8220;but that doesn&#8217;t matter right now. What does matter is that both of them are missing. Any idea as to where they might be?&#8221;

&#8220;Missing?&#8221;

&#8220;That&#8217;s right, MISSING, you oaf! Go back down to the dungeon and wait there in case they show up, I&#8217;ll search the rest of the grounds.&#8221;

&#8220;Y-yes, Ma&#8217;am.&#8221;

The other two handlers, Tony and a new man named Gino, hadn&#8217;t seen them either, so Sonia continued her search with even more urgency. Raven was meeting with The Board of Directors up in New York regarding the Jason/Marco matter. He had asked her to keep an eye on the two girls, and he wasn&#8217;t going to be happy when he found out they were missing. 

Heading back to the house, she ran into Len.

&#8220;I thought I told to go . . .&#8221;

&#8220;But I just saw them.&#8221;

&#8220;Where?&#8221;

&#8220;Downstairs where they&#8217;re supposed to be. I was just coming up to tell you,&#8221; he then gave Sonia that &#8216;now who&#8217;s the oaf?&#8217; look, though he didn&#8217;t dare utter the comment out loud. 

&#8220;That&#8217;s impossible!&#8221; she stormed back into the house and down the steps to the dungeon. 

Heidi and Amber never realized how lucky they were. After finding the entrance at the other end of the escape tunnel impassable, they quickly made their way back to the house, locked the tunnel door again, and cleaned themselves up just before Len came down to find them going about their work as if nothing happened. 

Sonia was furious, but instead of confronting the girls, she hung back just around the corner and listened. It didn&#8217;t take long before Heidi whispered something to Amber about a tunnel, and then Sonia knew. 

Hurrying outside, she cursed herself for not figuring it out earlier. She checked the tunnel entrance in the woods. It was still locked. Next, she waited patiently for Heidi and Amber to finish their cleaning, and then after they left, went down to the other end of the tunnel and found that door locked too, only there were signs that the keyhole had been picked. 

Sonia knew now where the girls had been all that time while she was scouring the whole house for them. If not for that rusty lock on the outside entrance, then nothing would have prevented them from getting out and going to the police. Now all hell was coming down on them, and the fools hadn&#8217;t even realized it yet.

Later that evening when Raven arrived at the house, he barely said a word to anyone, but it was apparent to Sonia that his meeting with The Board didn&#8217;t go well because he was already in a foul mood. After she broke the bad news about Amber and Heidi, his reaction was immediate,

&#8220;Bring her up to my office.&#8221;

&#8220;Which one?&#8221;

&#8220;That blonde bitch,&#8221; he barked. &#8220;Heidi.&#8221;

Sonia paused a moment, &#8220;If you want to question one of them, then I suggest you start with the other girl. I think she&#8217;ll break much more easily . . .&#8221;

&#8220;I never said I was going to question her.&#8221;

He pulled the silver handled crop out of his desk drawer.


-----------------------


Amber woke up the next morning feeling anxious with every detail of the horrible nightmare still vividly imbedded in her mind. She showed up for breakfast as usual, but quickly lost her appetite when she noticed Heidi&#8217;s absence. 

She was sure Raven knew about their escape attempt through the tunnel. During the night, she remembered hearing the door to Heidi&#8217;s cell open and close, followed by footsteps heading down the corridor, as if someone had come to take her away to be questioned. Then there was the dream she had shortly after -- not just a dream, but a premonition of what was to come.

Her first session of the day was with Madam Isha, and the variation of dance they were going over was a difficult one called The Chain Dance. It required that a long, slender, gleaming chain be fastened to a steel bracelet on her right wrist. It looped downward before climbing gracefully to a wide chain ring on the front of her collar, through which it descended again, looping down and up to her left bracelet. If she were to stand motionless with her arms to her sides, the lower links of the chain would have fallen below her knees, so there was much that could be done with such a chain, because its purpose was not to confine, but to allow her to incorporate it in her dance. 

Amber still had to coordinate her movements carefully though, so she wouldn&#8217;t get tangled in it, and that morning, she was having trouble concentrating on what she was doing. Her teacher noticed it too. 

&#8220;You seem distracted this morning,&#8221; Isha inquired. &#8220;Is anything wrong?&#8221;

&#8220;No Mistress,&#8221; she lied. &#8220;I just didn&#8217;t sleep well last night.&#8221;

&#8220;Well your dance training is almost finished. I&#8217;m encouraged with how you have progressed so far, and in two weeks, I think you will be ready to perform in front of an audience.&#8221;

After her dance, Amber reported to Sonia for her second session, but the Madam had other plans.

&#8220;Master Raven wishes to see you,&#8221; she said flatly. &#8220;Follow me.&#8221;

For Amber, the walk up to her Master&#8217;s office seemed to take a century, and with each step, her feet grew heavy -- as if they were sinking in quicksand. To be summoned by Raven was never a good thing, but now her conscience was wracked with so much guilt that her entire body shook visibly underneath her tunic. 

She felt like a schoolgirl being called to the principal&#8217;s office for her punishment. The moment reminded her of a roll-play session she once had with one of the guests -- a man in his fifties who apparently enjoyed spanking the backsides of &#8216;little teenaged girls&#8217; more than fucking. 

(The game went like this: Amber, the school girl, was &#8216;summoned&#8217; from her room up to the Office of The Headmaster, dressed only in her pajamas. There, her guilt was immediately determined, and the punishment set.

&#8220;Normally a girl would be sent to detention,&#8221; the man referring to himself as &#8216;the headmaster&#8217; told her, &#8220;but due to the seriousness of your offense, I am obliged to inflict on you the most severe form of punishment that is permitted at this institution,&#8221; and then a cold smile appeared on his face. &#8220;You shall be caned.&#8221;

She was ordered to stand astride a chair and bend over the back, grasping the legs as close as she could to the floor with her bottom raised high and in perfect position for what was to come next. 

He pulled her pajama bottoms down, exposing both naked cheeks. She was then ordered to spread her legs wider, far enough to show him her treasures, which were shaved as baby-smooth as a pre-teen&#8217;s crotch. He swished the cane a few times in the air first, and then without warning, brought it down hard on her right cheek with an alarming whirring sound. A bright red welt sprang up immediately, but Amber did not. She clung to the chair, jerking back her raised hips in thrusting, orgasmic-like movements as he struck her again and again, first on the buttocks and then on the sensitive flesh in between). 

Even now, Amber could still feel those stinging blows and the burning welts on her skin. She nearly swooned just thinking about it, but the sound of Sonia softly knocking on Raven&#8217;s door brought her mind back with a jolt.

&#8220;Come in,&#8221; came a voice.

Sonia opened the door and stepped aside, allowing Amber to pass before closing it again behind her.

Raven was seated behind his desk reading some papers, and just as Amber was about to drop to her knees (as slaves were expected to do when facing their Master) he spoke to her without raising his eyes.

&#8220;Remain standing.&#8221;

So Amber didn&#8217;t move, and while she waited, she was suddenly aware of how warm the room was in his presence. She could feel tiny beads of sweat rising on her forehead, and even though she was wearing a sleeveless tunic, her body was still percolating underneath, and the wetness gathering in her armpits began to soak into the bright red fabric creating dark stains underneath.

Thinking about it made her cheeks flush with embarrassment. Women were supposed to be cool creatures, not prone to perspire like men. If a woman broke into a sweat, it usually meant something hard was working on her body, or about to.

Raven finally raised his eyes to her and leaned back in his chair.

&#8220;Do you know why I summoned you here?&#8221; 

&#8220;No Sir.&#8221;

&#8220;You have no idea?&#8221; The sound of his calm voice grated on her nerves.

&#8220;N-no Sir.&#8221;

He suddenly stood up from the chair, reached into his coat pocket and tossed something heavy and metallic onto the desk. 

&#8220;Then would you care to explain THIS?&#8221;

Amber&#8217;s eyes grew wide as saucers as they focused on the open padlock from the escape tunnel. It was rusty all over, except for the fresh scratch marks around the keyhole where Heidi had picked it with her hairpin. 

&#8220;I&#8217;m waiting for an answer . . .&#8221;

&#8220;I . . . I don&#8217;t understand what you&#8217;re asking, Sir.&#8221;

&#8220;I&#8217;ve read Sonia&#8217;s report,&#8221; he pointed to the paper on his desk. &#8220;So don&#8217;t make this any worse for yourself by lying to me, because it only insults my intelligence.&#8221; 

Amber felt the light silk of her garment flutter against her shivering body underneath. When she finally dragged her eyes up to meet his, they were greeted by a very pointed defined face. Raven had high, ridged cheekbones and a straight nose. His shoulder-length hair was slicked back against his scalp and jet black in color. That wasn&#8217;t the most intimidating part of him, though. His black, piercing eyes, now inflamed with such anger, were terrifying. 

&#8220;Now tell me the truth!&#8221;

&#8220;We . . .&#8221; she swallowed hard, &#8220;we went into the tunnel, Sir.&#8221;

Raven placed both hands on the desk and leaned forward, his stare narrowing into slits.

&#8220;You mean you BROKE in.&#8221;

&#8220;Y-yes, Sir.&#8221;

&#8220;Yes, you did what?&#8221;

&#8220;Yes, Sir . . . we broke in.&#8221;

&#8220;You and WHO else?&#8221;

Amber paused. Raven already knew the answer to his own question, but he wanted to hear it from her, and she wanted to tell him. She wanted to tell her Master that it was all Heidi&#8217;s idea, that SHE talked her into it, that SHE picked the lock. Amber wanted to blame Heidi for everything, but something inside was keeping her from saying these things.

&#8220;Answer me, girl!&#8221; 

&#8220;It . . . it was Heidi,&#8221; she finally stammered.

&#8220;And for what purpose did you and Heidi break into the tunnel?&#8221;

&#8220;To escape, Sir.&#8221; 

&#8220;I see.&#8221; 

Raven slowly approached her from behind the desk. A bead of sweat rolled down Amber&#8217;s cheek. He gently brushed it away and stroked her hair. It was a gesture of tenderness, until he raised the back of his hand and struck her across the same cheek with such force, that it sent her reeling head first into the wall behind her. She then fell to the floor, dazed. 

&#8220;You stupid bitch,&#8221; his voice raised. &#8220;Did you REALLY think you could get away with it?&#8221;

She was too confused and terrified to answer. Lying on her side, the fall had forced her tunic to slip a good distance up past her naked thighs, but she made no effort to pull it down. She didn&#8217;t dare move a muscle.

&#8220;Not only did you betray me, you continued to lie about it. Even when you knew you were caught, you still tried to deceive me &#8211; you and that BITCH, Heidi. Now answer truthfully, did SHE put you up to this?&#8221;

&#8220;Yes, Master.&#8221;

&#8220;And it was all HER idea, wasn&#8217;t it?&#8221;

&#8220;Yes, Master.&#8221;

Amber was still lying on the floor, her tear-streaked face hidden under one arm. Everything was a blur &#8211; the throbbing in her head where she hit the wall, the blood trickling from her nose, her uppermost leg, exposed and vulnerable through the open tunic -- only the sound of Raven&#8217;s angry voice registered clear in her mind. She didn&#8217;t even notice the riding crop he was now holding in his hand, not until he struck her with it, the blow slicing across her naked thigh. Amber yelped like a dog, her body shuddered, but she still didn&#8217;t move.

&#8220;On your knees,&#8221; he ordered, &#8220;and cover yourself.&#8221;

She quickly got up and knelt before him while pulling the tunic tightly around her legs. She could feel the burning of her skin underneath where the crop hit it, and the throbbing in her head was more evident now.

When he called Sonia back into his office, the mistress was holding a leash and pair of wrist cuffs chained together.

&#8220;Ko-lar,&#8221; he ordered. 

Amber immediately obeyed and raised her arms, crossing her wrists over her head, her eyes still lowered in supplication. One metal cuff was locked around her wrist, then the other, and when she lowered her arms again, the chains rattled in front of her. Both ankles were cuffed and chained in the same fashion, and finally, the leash was clipped to the back of her collar.&nbsp; 

&#8220;You are going to get used to wearing those for awhile,&#8221; Raven told her. &#8220;Day and night, you&#8217;ll never stop listening to them clinking, reminding you of what you are, and what you will always be. This is for your own good and when your mind is &#8216;right&#8217; again, I&#8217;ll make my decision as to what to do with you next. Now stand up.&#8220;

Amber slowly rose to her feet, eliciting more tinkling laughter of her chains.

&#8220;Remove her silk.&#8221;

Sonia pulled a knife from her belt and tore a hole into the back of Amber&#8217;s tunic, then with both hands, she ripped the garment off her body so that she was naked except for the cuffs and chains. The cloth could easily have been removed by pulling it over her head, but the act symbolized the &#8216;stripping away&#8217; of her status as a slave. She was no longer a Red Silk, no longer a Gorean dancer; she was nothing, and possessed nothing. 

&#8220;Now get her out of my sight,&#8221; and Raven turned back to his desk. 

With a yank of the leash, Sonia led Amber down the hall. The chains rattled between her feet as she walked. They went down the staircase to the main level. Amber thought they would turn the corner next and then go down the narrow steps to the dungeon, but instead, Sonia took her outside. 

They crossed the grounds to a thick wall of trees on one side and a path Amber had never seen before. It was uncomfortably hot and humid that day, causing her scalp to prickle with sweat and her chestnut skin to glisten in the mid-day sun. Her mind was swimming in a murky stew of fear, shame and confusion. She wanted to beg Sonia for mercy, but knew there was nothing she could say or do that would change the inevitable.

The path was a short trek to a building that looked like a kennel. Beyond it, there was a second building made of stone. There were no windows to be seen and the door was padlocked. Sonia pulled the keys and unlocked the door. Warm air rushed out to greet them, and when Amber entered the building, she froze. The mystery of what happened to Heidi was finally uncovered.

Standing naked and spread-eagled with her back against a stone support column in the center of the room, Heidi&#8217;s feet were shackled to the floor, her arms stretched high and wide above her head and chained to a metal bar. The bar was chained to a steel cable that ran up around two pulleys, then down again to a large barrel, now filling slowly with water from a tank above. A black leather mask covered her head completely &#8211; no holes for the eyes or ears, just two slits under her nose so she could breath a little.&nbsp; 

Amber stood, her eyes transfixed with horror and fascination on what she was seeing. The strain in Heidi&#8217;s arms and legs were clearly evident. Rivers of sweat trickled down her body all over, leaving puddles on the stone floor. Her large, melon-breasts stood out from her ribs invitingly, and the smooth sex between her open legs could easily have been violated by anyone who happened by, but obviously this form of punishment had nothing sexual to do in its intent, and she guessed that Heidi had been hanging there for some time.

&#8220;Raven believes in keeping friends together,&#8221; Sonia told her. &#8220;But you have some catching up to do. Heidi&#8217;s been waiting here for over an hour now. Follow me.&#8221;

With a tug of the leash, she led Amber to the other side of the column. As they passed, Heidi jerked against her restraints, causing her breasts to shake provocatively off her jutting ribs. Her breathing was shallow, rapid and the air whistled through the tiny holes in her mask.

At the opposite wall, a second rigging identical to Heidi&#8217;s was already set up. 

&#8220;Stand with your back to the column and reach for that bar.&#8221;

Amber raised her arms high and grasped it tightly as Sonia locked her wrist irons to the chains on each end with her own chain draped between them. 

&#8220;Now spread,&#8221; Sonia ordered, and Amber widened her stance so the mistress could padlock her ankle chains to a pair of steel rings mounted into the floor. 

"Well, I guess you're secure enough now. I don't think you will be going anywhere.&#8221; 

Amber stood trembling, swaying weakly, her limbs stretched in an X and her back slightly arched. Beads of sweat flowed fresh from her body in the heat and fear of inescapable bondage and she could feel her heart pounding with adrenaline. 

As Sonia paced before her, she sensed from her Mistress the inward struggle of a woman trying to maintain her composure. When she moved in close, her eyes darted to Amber&#8217;s smooth, open armpits, now shimmering with sweat. She leaned forward and brushed the right arm with her tongue, then nuzzled the warmth there, breathing in the salty-sweet scent of her body.

Amber replied with a soft moan. She tugged her wrists above, but the unyielding bar would not relinquish its hold, nor would Sonia relinquish her hold, and with loving caresses, her wet tongue swirled, tasted and explored both pits. 

Then with another shock of recognition, Amber felt a hand on her hip. Fingers slowly traced the lines up her ribs to her breast and thumbed the hardened nipple in a lazy motion that made her body shudder inside. Another hand slid up the small of her back and grasped her hair, then suddenly, her head was yanked back forcefully, and when her eyes snapped open, she was staring into Sonia&#8217;s eyes leering back at her.

&#8220;Please Mistress . . .&#8221;

&#8220;Did I give you permission to speak?&#8221;

&#8220;No Mistress . . . I&#8217;m sorry.&#8221;

&#8220;You WILL be sorry after I&#8217;m through with you,&#8221; she let go of Amber&#8217;s hair and stepped back. &#8220;You know it&#8217;s a shame. I&#8217;ve been looking for a slave of my own, and I thought you were the one. I was sure of it the first day I brought you here. I saw the potential, and I would have paid top dollar for you on the block if necessary,&#8221; the sound of her voice was seeping with regret, &#8220;but that&#8217;s water under the bridge now. Heidi really fucked you over with her crazy ideas . . . isn&#8217;t that so, Hon?&#8221;

Sonia called over to Heidi and there was a moan from the other side of the column, followed by a brief rattle of her chains.

&#8220;That&#8217;s right. She&#8217;s the one to blame for this little predicament you&#8217;re in, and now you&#8217;ll both have to pay for betraying us,&#8221; Sonia&#8217;s the words trailed with her as she turned and moved to where the barrel stood, full of water.

&#8220;This set-up is impressive, don&#8217;t you think? The water slowly fills this barrel from the tank above it. The weighted barrel goes down, and YOU go up. This red valve here keeps the water in the tank. A simple twist and . . .&#8221;

Sonia turned the valve about one quarter turn, and water started to pour from the hose into the barrel. 

&#8220;Wallah! There you have it! Now, if my memory serves me correct, you weigh approximately 112 pounds, and at 8 pounds per gallon, that comes to an equivalency of just under 14 gallons. This barrel holds more than 50 gallons of water and that will easily lift you off the ground . . . WHOOPS . . . I almost forgot . . .&#8221; 

Sonia knelt down and reached under the barrel. There was a hole there that allowed the water to pour into a floor drain, so she took a stopper dangling from a chain and pushed it in, plugging the hole.

&#8220;There. Now the water can&#8217;t escape, and neither can you. Just one more final touch . . .&#8221;

Sonia took out a mask from the closet identical to the mask Heidi was wearing and pulled it over Amber&#8217;s head. Suddenly, her world was plunged into artificial darkness. The straps were tightened, pressing the leather snug against her nose and face. She could barely breath with her mouth through the holes.

&#8220;This should keep your mind focused on what&#8217;s happening to you, though I doubt you&#8217;ll be able to think of anything else. In a few moments, you will feel the cable and bar pulling on your arms as the water forces the barrel down on the other end. Then slowly, it will counter your weight and lift you up in the air, naked, helpless and gloriously suspended, that is, until those floor chains start tugging at your feet, and that&#8217;s when the fun REALLY begins. 

&#8220;For the next half hour or so, you will feel the constant ever-increasing pressure on your limbs while your body is forced into a painful, yet sublime tug-of-war between two forces much more powerful than your delicate features. 

&#8220;Eventually, all of the water will be drained from the tank, and the barrel will stop its descent, but that&#8217;s 400 pounds, and I imagine a lot of physical damage will be been done before that happens. Usually the shoulders pop free of their sockets, followed by the legs. You will also have trouble breathing as the muscles responsible for filling your lungs are stretched so much they&#8217;ll be unable to perform their task. 

&#8220;If you ask me, the period following the onset of asphyxia is the most spectacular, satisfying part of a terminal rack session, because the subject is already in immense pain from the stretching, but now with the sweet agony of strangulation added to her ordeal. 

&#8220;Of course, none of this will happen if I return in time to pull the stopper out of that barrel, so you better pray hard that I don&#8217;t trip and fall while going back to the house and knock myself out. 

&#8220;At least you won&#8217;t be alone, because you&#8217;ll have your &#8216;partner in crime&#8217; to share this misery with you while I&#8217;m gone . . . and that reminds me,&#8221; Sonia turned to the barrel again. &#8220;I mentioned before that Heidi already has a head start on you, so perhaps I should open your valve just a wee-bit more so you can catch up.&#8221;

Amber moaned in agony as she heard the squeak of the valve, and the water gushing out even louder. She was already feeling the barrel pulling against her arms as it inched downward. 

&#8220;That should do it . . . well, enjoy the trip,&#8221; Sonia blew a kiss. &#8220;I'll be seeing both of you on the other side, hopefully sooner than later!"

Amber heard the light click off and the door lock behind her. The weight of the barrel stretched her body tighter, and in the darkness of her mask she could hear the water spilling into it. The worst discomfort came from the shackles, for the added pressure caused the metal to dig even deeper into her wrists, causing them to scream in burning agony. 

She tried lowering her arms, and using all the strength she had left, managed to pull the bar down to her eye level, but she could get it no further, nor could she unhook her shackles from the bar. The chains between them were short, but just long enough to keep her fingers from reach. She tried holding the bar as long as she could, then slowly, allowed her tired arms to be pulled up again until they were fully extended even tighter than before. Amber knew she could do nothing to stop the inevitable, and the rigged device would do its work as it was designed. 

She thought of Heidi and reached back with one arm as far as she could, stretching past the column until she found her hand. Heidi moaned, their fingers clasped tightly, and for a moment, she felt some comfort in knowing there was someone else close to her, suffering as she suffered. 

They listened to each other&#8217;s ragged breaths and smelled each other&#8217;s sweat, then suddenly, Heidi pulled her hand away and threw herself forward from the column, rattling her chains before slamming back against it. Again and again, she hurled herself outward. Amber listened to Heidi&#8217;s chains banging in a steady tempo, forging in her mind the fear and anticipation of what she would soon be facing. Eventually, Heidi sagged back into her chains. Amber rubbed the back of her own hand against hers, and tried to speak to her. A few sounds filtered in from Heidi&#8217;s side of the column, but they seemed far away. 

Time seemed to stand still with nothing to do but languish over their condition. Water continued to pour into the barrels. Their bodies tightened. Joints began to stiffen and their muscles ached. Cuffs pressed against skin, the column rubbed its rough surface against their backs. 

When Heidi&#8217;s barrel started to lift her up, their hands separated for the last time. Amber tried to call out to her with muffled moans, but there was no response. Heidi was gone and she was alone. Nothing but blackness filled with steel and concrete.

Again Amber pulled against the chains, fighting their grip, but she didn't have the strength to lower her arms now. The pressure on her wrists was tremendous and she could only work her fingers in the air. The open valve on her tank allowed more water to flow through it than Heidi&#8217;s tank, so it would just be a few more minutes before the barrel started lifting her off the floor. 

More sweat flowed in lazy rivulets down the curves of her body. The inside of her mask felt like an oven and it was difficult to breath. Wet strands of her hair mashed against her scalp and more sweat rolled into her eyes, making them screw shut in irritation.

When her heels rose up, she pointed her toes as much as she could to maintain contact with the floor. She tried to adjust her feet to get a better stance and slammed hard against the gritty column behind her. She couldn&#8217;t seem to get her body to work right. Nothing moved and every muscle hurt like hell. Several seconds later, her toes cleared and it seemed as if the whole earth had dropped out beneath her and she was now suspended in a black void of nothingness. She jerked against the chains, an instinctive reaction to crossing the threshold. She uttered a long wail within the mask. The cuffs were digging deeper into her wrists now, cutting into her flesh. 

Up she rose, several inches until the chains at her feet tightened and pulled against her. The muscles in her legs and arms cried out in agony. Movement eased a few points of contact and ignited several more.

Behind the column, she felt Heidi struggling again. At first her suspended body rocked languidly back and forth, then arms vibrated vigorously, wrist chains grinding under the pressure. Her breath was shallow and rapid, whistling through the breathing holes of her mask. Amber tried calling back to her again, but there was no answer. Suddenly, Heidi&#8217;s chains twitched so violently, that Amber could actually feel the vibrations through the column. A deep guttural moan welled and slithered out into space. Heidi was no longer on the other end of the chain. Something else was there, shaking and fighting with a monstrous strength. 

By then, Amber&#8217;s hands were completely numb from the tightness of her shackles. A thousand little nips and needle pricks hovered around the rest of her body, and she could do nothing but feel these little assaults. Slowly, the barrel and chains exceeded what she had mistakenly thought were the limits of her capacity to stretch. In her lower back she felt her spine unload and straighten, the vertebrae decompressing from one another. She felt and heard a &#8216;pop&#8217; of cartilage in her left shoulder, the one she had dislocated over ten years ago, followed by a terrible shooting pain down her arm.

(&#8220;Oh my God please, no more please . . .&#8221;)

But the water poured steadily and showed no signs that the tank was getting empty. The chains kept pulling -- her stretched form hung, silently suffering in agony.

Then suddenly, a fear of another sort flooded her brain. Panic bubbled up in her throat. She couldn&#8217;t see them, but she knew they were near &#8211; The Furies &#8211; as Monique once called them. She was only dimly aware now of the violent frenzy erupting through her own body as her blind eyes searched the blackness. She thrashed against the chains and babbled incoherently. Her nipples became hard. In the vast darkness, through the mask, her mind's eye beheld the monsters, living on the far side of the circle and moving in closer. The little nips became bites as they swarmed around her like ants, ripping the flesh off her bones. 

Deep in her mind, the wailing began, for they also struck from within, rising out of the depths of her soul. Muscles, tendons shrieked and tore, blood boiled in her veins, bones shattered under the onslaught. Her head exploded into space, scattering itself in the dark void. Excruciating pain became softest pleasure, passionate love became murderous hate, and immobile bondage became perfect freedom. While the chains scraped and bruised her shattered body, and the blackness invaded her gaping mind, the Furies devoured her soul, swallowing it down in great bloody chunks. 

Finally, she wrapped what left she could find of her being around the creatures and embraced them with all her might.

Indoctrination

Chapter 31: The House of Cards

Amber thought she was going to die, and by the time Sonia returned to release her from her suspension, she could scarcely move a muscle she was so weak. Her body went limp like a rag when Tony picked her up in his arms. Her head fell sharply back, her arms dangling uselessly as he carried her to the door. Through blurred vision, she saw Heidi&#8217;s rigging hanging empty and wondered if her friend was alive or dead.

The door opened and a blast of cool air hit them. The weather had changed, creating a dark shroud over the trees. Amber cried out as she felt the pain flood through her body again. The sickening paralysis of her faculties still lingered, but her muscles and joints slowly began to awaken and scream their displeasure.

She felt herself being released and placed upon her knees. She felt the wet leaves underneath her and two sets of powerful hands grasped tightly around her upper arms. She swayed between the two men, and if not for them, she might have fallen over.

Looking up, she saw a tall, dark form mounted on a horse looming over her, silhouetted in the gloomy fog and shadowed columns of trees behind it. She was still naked, and could feel the gooseflesh rising as the chilled air settled in her bones.

&#8220;Master, I&#8217;m sorry . . .&#8221;

"Keep silent.&#8221; 

His command was hard; his low voice pierced her ears. She saw the glint of the crop handle under his belt. Instinctive fear revived her old faculties. The horrible sick weakness, the dimness, and the internal collapse all left her. She began to tremble, but it wasn&#8217;t from the cold.

She watched Raven dismount and approach while unzipping his fly. Still kneeling, Amber prepared herself for what she knew would happen next, but she was not ready for the suddenness of it, as he seized her by the nape of her neck and drove himself deep into her open mouth. It was not the caress of her lips he was looking for, but the back of her throat. For a long time he probed, and she felt the suffocating gag of flesh swell and harden, its slow repeated hammering finally bringing her to tears. Although he delighted and reveled the warmth of her mouth, Raven did not bring his pleasure to a climax, but withdrew in silence and turned away while zipping up his fly again.

&#8220;So is your mind right?&#8221;

&#8220;Yes, Master,&#8221; she responded between gasps.

Raven laughed as he climbed back up on the horse.

&#8220;I don&#8217;t think so,&#8221; then turning his mount briefly to face Sonia he issued the order before leaving. 

&#8220;Take her back.&#8221;


-----------------------


For the next several days, and she had no idea how many, Amber was kept alone in a small, dark room in the building next to the kennels. She remained there most of the day, lying on a filthy mattress, naked and restrained in some way to keep her from moving. When the door was open, what she saw in the light offered little comfort. From cracks in the walls water leached down the broken, vertical surfaces. Moss and mildew grew in the corners, and insects crawled secretly along the musty surfaces. Occasionally, she heard the distant barking of dogs in the kennel nearby.

She was usually bound with rope in hogtie fashion &#8211; arms and legs wrenched back and tied together, with more ropes around her shoulders and thighs to keep her body bent sharply backward as she lay on her side. More ropes were then wrapped tightly around her breasts in a visually intricate and decorative pattern, causing them to bulge outward like ripe melons. Finally, metal &#8216;gator&#8217; clamps were fastened to her nipples with a chain draped between, and Sonia had a method of enhancing their erotic impact by, first, pinching, licking and soft-biting Amber&#8217;s nubs until they were standing straight up, then applying the clamps and chain after prepping them in a freezer.

For hours, she was left alone in complete darkness and dead silence with nothing to occupy her thoughts other than how the ropes and clamps were tormenting her body. She often tried keeping her mind busy by conjuring up memories of the past, of her childhood, of when she was free, anything, but those memories seemed distant and too weak to blot out the bleak surroundings and her wretched situation. She felt abandoned.

The few times she ever saw the world outside her room was when Sonia came for her next session, and that was very brief, for as soon as the door opened, a blindfold was usually placed over her eyes. The chains were then re-attached to the cuffs on her wrists and ankles before she was led away by a leash tripping and stumbling behind her mistress. 

The sessions themselves were rigorous and brutal. The limbs of her body were often stretched or contorted in ways that left her screaming and whimpering for mercy. Sometimes she was whipped or flogged. Other times she was merely left alone to suffer the cruelty of her bondage &#8211; always in darkness and in silence.

Then one day, Sonia arrived without the blindfold. She attached a leash to Amber&#8217;s collar and guided her out into the woods as always, only this time, instead of the house, they went to an old well behind the building. A crane assembly with a wheel and chain were set up next to it with the arm of the crane reaching out to them. Amber was told to remain standing while the chain was attached to her wrist cuffs. Her ankle cuffs were then chained and another pair of cuffs fastened to her knees to keep them together. Amber stared into the well, her heart racing. The hole seemed to go on forever, engulfing the light completely, and there was a smell of dirt and mold emanating from its ancient stone walls, like a mildewy cellar after a rainstorm &#8211; more horrible than the smell of death. 

A pair of goggles with a head strap was secured over her eyes, and plugs placed on her nose and in her ears. She wanted to beg Sonia for mercy, to try and convince her Mistress that this wasn&#8217;t necessary, that she had learned her lesson, yet before she could even speak, a tube with a mouth piece on the end was forced into her mouth, then secured with duct tape.

Tony manned the wheel, and when given the order, he began turning a crank. Amber could hear the metallic clicks and clunks ringing in her ears even through the earplugs. In a short time, she felt the chain tugging against her wrists. Her arms were then raised and stretched high above her head until she was on her toes. Her head fell back and her breath quickened through the tube in her mouth, a sublime ache permeating her young body. After so many days in isolation and so many painful sessions with very little to eat, her muscles felt tender, like it wouldn&#8217;t take much effort to tear her limbs right out of their sockets. Her appearance showed it too. As the ground left her feet, her stomach hollowed and her ribs protruded sharply, exaggerating her waif-like frame. Only her breasts retained their youthful shape and her nipples stood proudly erect in the open air.

Suddenly, the wheel stopped and the arm of the crane was pivoted over until she hung over the well. A cinderblock with a rope attached was tied to her ankle restraints then thrown unceremoniously into the hole. When block reached the end of the rope, Amber felt a jolt against her body and moaned as the pain lanced through her knees, thighs and shoulders simultaneously. 

More clicks from the wheel sounded as her weighted down body began to descend into the hole. She felt like a morsel of raw meat dangling over the open gullet of some strange creature and there was nothing she could do. She was far too weak to even put up a struggle, much less free her self from the chain, and if she did, the sudden release would only have hurled her downward into the depths below. 

Slowly, the murky blackness crept in around her as the opening above grew smaller and smaller. She felt the water engulf her feet, then her legs. Her entire body clenched in reaction. A coldness crept around her thighs, around her belly and breasts. When her face went under, it was so dark and murky that she could see nothing, even with the goggles on. Her long hair swirled around her. The wheel didn&#8217;t stop turning until she was completely submerged and once again, Amber was left alone, in darkness and silence. Her only lifeline was a long hose attached to her mouthpiece that snaked upward through the hole and out of the well. She breathed heavily into it, sucking in gulps of stale air. 

A small piece of her consciousness tried to command her legs to kick her toward the surface, to push off the walls, but her body refused to do anything other than contort and writhe in the brackish water. Her vision began to go fuzzy, blurring around the edges, and an eerie calm settled over her thoughts. Amber had no way of knowing how much longer this would last, nor what would happen to her after it was over, but she was sure of one thing &#8211; that in the end, her mind would &#8220;be right&#8221;. 


-----------------------


The entrance to the parking garage was well lit and loomed ahead, so Phil Trask slowed the pace of his Crown Vic as he approached it. Beside him in the passenger seat, his partner, Joe Kelly, sat in silence, gazing at the garage through the windshield. Kelly checked his watch again, although he already knew the time, 9:30pm. Right on schedule.

Trask turned into the inclined ramp and proceeded to the second level. The place was deserted with the exception of one or two parked vehicles. It reminded him of the movie, &#8220;All The President&#8217;s Men,&#8221; and how Robert Redford met his informant, Deep Throat, during the Nixon Watergate scandal. 

They parked the car at the very back of the second level on the north side. Without a word, they popped open their doors, and watched the man they were scheduled to meet emerge from the shadows behind a pillar to greet them. Despite there differing backgrounds, the informant somehow looked strikingly similar to the two FBI agents. All three were clean-shaven with short, trimmed hair, and dressed dark slacks, a button down shirt with no tie, and a light jacket. The jackets on both agents fit loosely though, masking the Glock 22 they each carried shoulder-holstered underneath.

The informant pulled out a cigarette and lit it with his lighter &#8211; another cheap Hollywood gimmick Trask remembered from the Redford movie. Still standing in the shadows about six feet away, he looked over his shoulder nervously and took a draw from the cigarette, the embers glowing a bright red on the tip.

Finally Trask broke the silence, &#8220;What do you have for us?&#8221;

The man took another draw, &#8220;Enough to indict a lot of people.&#8221;

&#8220;So start spilling,&#8221; Kelly broke in.

The man&#8217;s eyes flashed at Kelly then back to Trask.

&#8220;You&#8217;ll have to excuse my partner,&#8221; Trask told him. &#8220;He&#8217;s a bit impatient.&#8221;

For the first time, the informant grinned, &#8220;This isn&#8217;t the good cop/bad cop routine is it?&#8221;

&#8220;We&#8217;re not cops,&#8221; Trask answered shortly, &#8220;and this isn&#8217;t the Lux Radio Theater either. You called us, remember? And it was your idea to set up a meeting here. Now you told me over the phone you had compiled a list of names. Is this true or not?&#8221;

&#8220;Do we have an agreement? Full immunity and witness protection?&#8221;

&#8220;If you have what we want, but that&#8217;ll take a lot more than a list, my friend.&#8221;

The informant looked over his shoulder again, then pulled a folded piece of paper out of his coat pocket and handed it to the agent.

Trask unfolded it and quickly scanned the names.

&#8220;Jesus,&#8221; he shook his head. &#8220;There has to be at least forty here.&#8221;

&#8220;Any from our Missing Persons files?&#8221; Kelly asked.

Trask nodded, &#8220;Looks like all of them.&#8221;

&#8220;And that&#8217;s just the tip of the ice burg,&#8221; the man took another nervous puff from his cigarette.

&#8220;Do you know a man named, Marco Sanchez?&#8221; Trask folded the paper again and carefully put it in his pocket.

&#8220;Yeah, I knew him. He&#8217;s gone.&#8221;

&#8220;You mean, dead?&#8221;

&#8220;That&#8217;s right. They knew you guys were looking for him, so naturally they put out an order.&#8221;

&#8220;Very efficient. Who did the hit?&#8221;

The informant tossed his cigarette on the ground and squashed the butt underfoot. &#8220;Later,&#8221; he said. &#8220;After we work out the details of our arrangement.&#8221;

&#8220;You do realize we&#8217;re armed,&#8221; Kelly said with a hint of contempt in his voice. &#8220;We could just take you in and let you sit in cold cell for a while until you talk.&#8221;

&#8220;That would be doing things the hard way . . .&#8221;

&#8220;You&#8217;ve got a deal,&#8221; Trask broke in. &#8220;You give us all the information you have and testify in court, then we&#8217;ll give you complete immunity and put you in our witness protection program.&#8221;

&#8220;I won&#8217;t testify.&#8221;

&#8220;Why not?&#8221;

&#8220;I don&#8217;t want these people to know who sold them out. You FBI guys really don&#8217;t understand what you have here, do you? This organization is big. You&#8217;ll never get all of them, which means for the rest of my life, I&#8217;ll be looking over my shoulder. That means no court appearances, no signed confessions either. Just bring me in and set something up for me. In return, I&#8217;ll give you all the leads you need to bring this whole organization down, and plenty of people to testify. Fair enough?&#8221;

&#8220;All right,&#8221; Trask said. &#8220;but can you at least tell us your name, or should I just call you Deep Throat?&#8221;

The man grinned again, and for the first time he looked relaxed, &#8220;I saw that movie too. Four times. As for my name . . . it&#8217;s Dave Roberts.&#8221;
