Synopsis: A Domme's realization that she is really a sub at heart.  From D to s 
Rita discovered the world of BDSM about a year ago but had not really had
  much experience in it until about 6 months ago when she put her profile up
  on Alt. She didn't really know whether she was a sub or Domme, but she really
  enjoyed the idea of control and submission. She was very much in charge of
  things in her vanilla life, where she owned her own business with a small staff.
  So she was very used to controlling others and seeing to their welfare. So
  it was only natural for her to decide she was a Domme despite the fact that
  she was tired of being in charge 24/7. She viewed various profiles to see what
  was out there. She sifted through the flood of emails she received in response
  to her profile. She had mistakenly listed herself as bi-curious and many of
  the responses were from women. While she was not interested in having a female
  sub, their profiles made fascinating reading. Some of them touched a chord
  in her that she didn't realize was there. But she was so much more comfortable
  being in charge and despite the curiosity those profiles aroused in her, she
  didn't change her original decision that she was a Dominant rather than a submissive.
  She found a couple of different submissive men and had some sessions with them
  but was totally turned off by their lack of ego. They were doormats pretending
  to be men. Finally, she found a sub who matched her desires. He was older than
  she was, well educated, worked in well paying professional job, and had experience
  as both a sub and a Dom. So she replied to his email. From there, they corresponded
  regularly and finally she allowed him to call her. His voice and mannerisms
  on the phone were so sexy. She was totally taken by him. He took her commands
  readily, and even, eagerly. But he had a sense of self, he was not a doormat.
  He was obviously sexually aroused by her domination. But, strangely enough,
  she wasn't. But he was so sweet and caring, that she didn't care. At least
  at first. 
But there were aspects of being a Domme and of men that she just wasn't sure
  about. So she wrote to a Dom whose profile she liked to ask his advice. He
  wrote back with some answers and some questions. She liked the way he wrote
  and the thought he put into his answers. So she started exchanging regular
  emails with him. It was obvious that he was completely comfortable in the Dominant
  role. He was not a sadist, not into humiliation for the sake of humiliating
  a sub, he was just a person who was in control of himself and those around
  him and completely comfortable with being so. As he described his philosophy
  and training techniques, she started to imagine what it would be like to be
  his sub. 
But this was only imagination. In real life, she had an online sub that she
  was soon to meet. They had a special weekend planned. Since they lived far
  apart, the planning for this weekend was important. It wouldn't be a quick
  meeting over dinner. She felt as though she was falling in love with him. He
  seemed to be everything she wanted. Finally, the big day came. He met her at
  the airport and they shared their first kiss. It was not the passionate kiss
  she had imagined, but rather a quick peck on the lips. What was this? Where
  was the passion he showed in his emails and on the phone? She decided it must
  be the public forum and decided to wait until they were in private for more.
  They chatted as they drove to her hotel, mostly about the sights she could
  see as they drove into the city. When they reached her hotel, he grabbed her
  bags and carried them in for her, just as she expected him to. He stood quietly
  by as she checked in and then followed her to her room. Once in the room, she
  turned to get a kiss and this one was much better. At least, it was more passionate.
  But still not the soul shattering kiss she had imagined for their first kiss.
  She commanded him to strip, a command he followed eagerly. Once naked, she
  commanded him to kneel. She lifted her skirt and revealed her thong covered
  pussy. Where upon she pulled aside the thong and commanded him to eat her pussy,
  a task he threw himself into whole heartedly. He licked and slurped until she
  came, but once again it was not as she imagined it would be. When she had cum,
  she let him fuck her for the first time but he didn't cum until she spoke to
  him in her command voice and told him to either cum or get out. 
He had an evening planned for them, showing her the sights and a nice dinner
  for two. So they got dressed and went out. The evening was enjoyable but not
  very exciting. She was beginning to think that there wasn't any chemistry between
  them but decided to wait and see. Once back at her hotel, she proceeded to
  command his obedience. She whipped him when he didn't obey her quickly enough
  and finally tied him spread out on the bed. Then she mounted his cock and used
  it for her pleasure, an event that clearly excited him. Finally, he left for
  the night. He had to work the next morning for a few hours. As soon as he left,
  she logged on to her email and noticed her Dom mentor was online. For the next
  few hours they chatted over IM about her feelings. He gave her advice and once
  again she wondered what it would be like to be his sub. He was so masterful,
  confident, and caring. Finally they signed off and she went to bed. As she
  lay there in bed, she started to think about her mentor. As she thought of
  him, her hand crept down to her pussy where it started rubbing her clit. Before
  long she came explosively, but what shocked her as she came was that she yelled �Master!� As
  she lay there in the afterglow of an incredible orgasm she considered what
  had just happened. What was she doing, cumming to fantasies of being a sub?!
  It took her a long time to fall asleep that night, her mind a morass of confusion.
  What was she? A Domme or a sub? How could she be a sub? She was a business
  owner, a manager of people, a driving force in her community! It could not
  be! But in her heart of hearts, she longed to have someone care for her. Someone
  to take the burden of decision making from her, at least for a few hours. 
Finally she fell asleep only to wake up groggily the next morning. She ordered
  a room service breakfast and logged on. Disappointingly, her Dom mentor was
  not online. So she responded to her emails and checked the stock market to
  see how her portfolio was doing. While she was checking her portfolio, an IM
  came up on her screen. It was her Dom mentor! She immediately responded to
  his query and they proceeded to chat for the next two hours. She shared her
  confusion with him and he responded playfully with some commands. Commands
  she willingly, no, eagerly followed. As she was kneeling naked on the floor,
  she realized her pussy was so wet that it was dripping down her leg. Now she
  was really confused. When he allowed her to sit at her computer again, she
  told him what had happened. He suggested that she was just reacting to her
  disappointment with her current sub and should wait to see what happened with
  him today. He told her that deciding to change roles was a big decision, one
  that she should consider fully. So, armed with his advice, she dressed for
  her day with her sub. She selected a power suit, one that conveyed her commanding
  personality and would send a subconscious message to her sub that She was in
  charge. 
At the appointed time, he arrived at her door. She strode through the door
  as he held it open for her. As they arrived at his car, she held out her hand
  for the keys. She was in charge and expected to drive. He meekly handed her
  the keys and held the car door open for her. He closed the door after she was
  inside and ran around to get in the passenger side. The day went well enough,
  he was properly submissive while showing her the sights. But as they approved
  her hotel that evening, she was not satisfied. So when they entered her suite,
  she ordered him to strip and proceeded to whip him to vent her frustration.
  But even that did not help. So she once again tied him to the bed and used
  him for her pleasure. But when she finally came, it was only a shadow to the
  orgasm she had had the previous evening fantasizing about being her mentor's
  sub. So she sent her sub home, confusion evident on his face. She just said
  she had a headache and wanted nothing more than to lie down. 
As soon as he left, she got online again and found, to her relief, that her
  Dom mentor was online too. Even better, he had his webcam on. So she turned
  hers on also. This time, he wasted no time in commanding her to kneel naked
  in front of the computer. A command she eagerly obeyed. For the next couple
  of hours, he commanded her to assume various positions and even subject herself
  to discipline. She felt funny applying the clips she had bought to use on her
  sub to her own nipples and clit. The same with a butt plug in her ass. But
  the inner peace she felt as she submitted to His will was incredible! She almost
  exploded each time he let her cum and he let her cum multiple times!! It seemed
  just an instant had passed when he told her he was signing off for the night.
  But it was 3 in the morning! They had been at it for 5 hours. She wearily climbed
  into bed and fell into a deep, deep sleep. She was only awoken by a pounding
  on the door. As she blearily peered at the clock, she was surprised to see
  it was 10 a.m. , long past the time she was supposed to meet her sub for breakfast.
  Realizing it must be him; she climbed out of bed and stumbled to the door to
  let him in. His eyes went wide when she opened the door; he was obviously staring
  at her breasts. But he had seen them before, so what was he looking at with
  that expression? So she looked down, only to see the nipple clips still attached
  as well as one attached to her clit. It seemed incredible that she had fallen
  asleep with them on. Now that she realized they were there, she realized her
  nipples and clit were numb. She let her sub in without saying a word and proceeded
  to remove the clips. The pain of the blood rushing in behind the clips as they
  came off was excruciating! But at the same time it was exhilarating! She actually
  came from the pain. Forgetting her sub was in the room, she let out a series
  of loud moans as the orgasm washed over her. What must he think?!! She realized
  that she didn't care. So she stumbled to the shower and proceeded to let the
  hot water beat down on her. As she emerged from the shower, her sub was there
  with a towel. As he dried her off, she reflected on what was happening. She
  realized that she would be so much happier being the one drying rather than
  the one being dried off. She strode back into the bedroom and proceeded to
  dress, still without a word to her sub. �Let us go eat.� Her first words of
  the morning. In silence, they went to the hotel dining room where they were
  seated in an out of the way table. The confusion in her mind was falling away
  as she realized what had happened to her last night. She realized that she
  was a sub and only desired to be a sub! As this incredible realization bubbled
  over her, she felt a great sense of relief. She knew, in her heart, that she
  wanted only to be cherished and controlled by a Man. Not just any Man, but
  her Dom mentor. So she began to softly talk to this man beside her who was
  also a sub. She told him of her recent confusion, her gradual change, and of
  the epiphany she had just experienced. At first, his face showed some anger
  which gave way to disappointment and finally he was nodding his head. He understood!
  He told of a similar experience, when he realized he was not a Dom, but a sub.
  He told her he not only understood but that he had sensed her confusion earlier.
  They clasped hands and shared a look, the look of two people who have found
  their place in life and love even if it wasn't with each other. Both knew they
  had a life long friend, someone to share their learning and joy with. After
  a long, leisurely and friendly breakfast, they parted. Each to seek out their
  destinies. He, to search for his Domme. She to email the Man she hoped would
  be her Master. 
She rushed to her room and immediately logged on, finding Him online! She
  wrote to him of her revelation and asked Him if he would be willing to accept
  her as his sub. He said he was seeking a new sub but could not make a decision
  without meeting her. So they arranged to meet the very next weekend. She asked
  Him if he would use her as his online sub, at least for today. He agreed! Her
  heart soared at the news! For the next few hours he put her through her paces.
  He forced her to submit in ways she had never contemplated making her sub do.
  At one point, He required her to go outside and expose herself to a bunch of
  teenage boys walking by in the hallway. It was incredible, it was humiliating,
  it was freedom! The incredible day finally ended, leaving her exhausted but
  satisfied in way she had never been. Again, she fell into a deep dreamless
  sleep, the sleep of a fully sated woman. She rose early the next morning and
  rushed to catch her plane home. But she took a moment to log on and let Him
  know what she was doing, how much she wanted him, and that she would give herself
  fully to him without any limits. 
The next week passed slowly. Each evening, he would give her a little of his
  time but he was busy and could not properly instruct her. So by the weekend,
  she was having a hard time concentrating. She was so anxious to meet Him, afraid
  that He would not take her as his. Friday finally came and with it her flight
  to Him. It seemed as though the trip to the airport and the subsequent flight
  happened as if in a dream. Finally she landed in His town. As she emerged from
  the security gate, she saw a sign with her name on it. Her heart started beating
  so loudly she thought everyone around her could hear it. She quickly walked
  over to Him. His face lit up upon seeing her and then he folder her in his
  arms, giving her the most passionate kiss she had ever had. His tongue explored
  her mouth before working up to tickle her ear where he whispered �I am glad
  you came, little one.� Taking her by the arm, he led her to pick up her bags.
  He surprised her by picking up her bags and carrying them himself. Sensing
  her surprise, he whispered to her �Your submission is a private thing, just
  between us. Perhaps later, you may display your status to the world as a whole.
  But for now, we are just a regular couple in public.� 
When they got to his house, he immediately had her strip and kneel before
  him. Then he placed his collar around her neck. She was not his property. She
  felt as though a great burden had been lifted from her shoulders. She was free
  of all the demands of being in control. Their life would have some bumps as
  she learned what being his meant, but she would learn and would live a life
  free from the demands that once burdened her.
