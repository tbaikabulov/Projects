A young, passive submissive use to rather tame, at least not severe sessions, an indiscretion during a spring break holiday she was allowed, even urged to take with another female friend, she&#8217;s about to take a leap into the more serious side of sadomasochism not knowing the depth of her Master&#8217;s manipulations to set it all in motion.

Part One
Chapter One
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She reluctantly but still obediently maintains her place on the specially constructed platform.&nbsp; Naked, kneeling, her version of the classic submissive pose overly exaggerated with painfully arched back shoulders obscenely separating her breasts just as he demands along with the more standard palms upward across spread knees, knees that are so widely parted on the matching raised wooden rails forming a &#8216;V&#8217; beneath her that her vaginal area&#8217;s fully exposed, forming a gapping split between her spread thighs.
Staring straight ahead past her thrust out breasts toward the only devices of pain noticeable anywhere in the room, a vat full of brine soaked hickory switches beside the closed door, she waits and she listens.&nbsp; Freshly bathed, shaven and oiled as instructed by his note left for her by her bedside, her virtually evenly tanned body shimmers under the singular light positioned above what he calls the discipline podium in the otherwise nearly barren room, her nipples ever so slightly jiggling with each calculated breath her only involuntary movement.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The room stone cold quiet as the waiting seems to linger on and on since it&#8217;s past his normal time to arrive home, the faintest of light filtering beneath the closed door, she barely blinks as she tries to concentrate, to relieve the tension of awaiting what she&#8217;s so afraid of is going to be a quite painful session if her intuition&#8217;s correct.&nbsp; Catching the glitter off the dripping body oil of an upturned nipple, knowing soon it&#8217;s quite possibly going to be the focus of his attention with one of those switches, she can already sense what the pain&#8217;s going to entail, the stinging, burning welts those willowy branches must leave across the tender flesh of bare breasts, not to mention down lower.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Hesitantly giving in to a nervous nibble across her lower lip, her moist tongue flicks a likewise unallowable circle around the inner edges of her slightly parted lips as she briefly glances toward the smoked one way glass portal next to the door.&nbsp; Not being able to determine if and when anyone could be behind it detecting her every prohibitive movement, sensing the annoying perspiration beading beneath the under globes of her breasts, her armpits, her bent knees as her joints have already begun their all too familiar aches from the continuously forced pose, she attempts to maintain that exact pose, dare not moving in case of being watched.
Trying to downplay the probability of the severity of what she&#8217;s facing, she&#8217;s hoping against hope it&#8217;s not because of her indiscretion while just recently allowed, even urged to take a brief holiday with her friend, another girl in Florida during spring break.&nbsp; If it is, it&#8217;ll certainly bring severe consequences, but, how could he possibly know anything about that?
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The lingering wait, finally the sound of footsteps, a shadow above the door jam, the knob turns, the door slowly opening as she feels her heart skipping a beat.&nbsp; Her eyes dipping down toward his feet, her body tensing even more, she can&#8217;t help noticing the thick roll of duct tape in his hand as she can&#8217;t help thinking, duct tape?&nbsp; Reflexively arching her chest even further outward as her breasts sway, spread wider apart, the backs of her hands pressing downward across her thighs, she inhales, holds her breath as he approaches.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Silently stepping toward her, seeing her naked, glistening body being offered out to him only embellished by the extra few inches in added height by the raised rails on the platform, he begins unrolling the tape in short, tearing rips as he takes in her incredibly erotic body so firm and well proportioned.&nbsp; Reaching down without a spoken word, guiding her right hand around her back, forcing her torso to twist as he shoves her fingers down across her left ankle already pressing against her right, a couple loops around wrist and foot and the sound of tape again ripping echoes across the room.&nbsp; Left hand to right ankle next as her slender waist twists to the other side, her arms forced to crisscross at the elbows as her substantial breasts sway back and forth as they spread wider and wider apart, he rolls the tape around both ankles securing them to the fixed rails beneath her.&nbsp; Another rip of tape and he reaches up, loops a couple times across both elbows pressing them firmly together before even more tape&#8217;s applied down across her calves just behind her bent knees, again securing her spread legs firmly above the raised rails.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Stepping out in front of her as the tape continues to tear in short, crisp rips between his fingers, spreading it across her spread lips just below her nostrils, pressing it firmly across her cheeks, her chin, he turns toward the vat.&nbsp; The few steps deliberate, the seemingly extensive amount of time choosing one from the other, he finally turns, flicks the drenched switch back and forth, side to side.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Eyes widening, chest pounding as her breasts jaunt perilously outward, the nipples jiggling virtually in opposite directions at times, she senses the tape burrowing deep into her flesh forcing her body to contort into a hopelessly defenseless position of being bowed back in a semi-arch.&nbsp; Still anxious by being bound so firmly by tape, usually it&#8217;s just ties, neckties to be exact, almost always loosely binding her, now the tapes&#8217; so tight and firm, much more ominous, not a good omen.
A couple flicks of the bitter scented spray spattering across her thrust out chest as he approaches, the sensation of the swishing air fluttering across her bare breasts, the bowing switch ominously flicking back and forth closer and closer with each approaching slow step, her reflexive grunts are muffled behind the final strip of tape.&nbsp; A pleading glance with a muffled groan, her head briefly jerking from side to side, she quickly inhales a deep breath in her flailing nostrils as the flickering spray centers across her nipples, just where she realizes the next swipe of the switch is about to make contact.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The crisp &#8216;thwack&#8217; of the willowy branch contacting the outer globe of her right breast, the switch sinking into, springing back leaving an instantaneous crimson welt tracing partially across the flattening nipple, that muffled grunt&#8217;s more distinguishable as her naked body arches uncontrollably forward.&nbsp; A second swipe of the bowing hickory from his flexing wrist quickly &#8216;smacking&#8217; across the inner globe of the same breast, the globular mound jerking, bouncing to a swaying standstill with the second red welt trailing across the first, her head rears back in pain as the tape sticks to her twitching lips.
Escalating harsh gasps as she wheezes through her flailing nostrils, the pain searing, even worse then she was so apprehensive it would be, the welling tears blur her vision as she glances down toward the epicenter of the throbbing pain while he steps back a step or so.&nbsp; The bodily aches of her pose quickly a thing of the past, her wrists twisting, chafing in the unforgiving taut sticky tape; each throbbing heartbeat brings what could closely be described as jolting shocks as the vinegar laden brine scorches her fresh, raw wounds.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Dipping the tip of the switch back down into the vat, twirling it in brief semi-circles in the splashing brine while taking his time, lifting it back out as the liquid streams down off its flexing tip, he again turns toward her.&nbsp; Watching her stomach hollowing beneath her protruding ribcage framing her inverted navel flexing with each rasping breath, seeing the tears dripping down across the silver duct tape revealing the silhouettes of her still parted lips, he again slowly approaches in silence, again allowing the brine droplets to splash across her bare flesh with back and forth swishes as he closes in.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Eyes briefly meeting, hers wide, glassy, his eyes piercing, her head noticeably shifts from side to side as she catches the sight of the switch being flicked back and forth near her other nipple.&nbsp; Unable to force herself to stare away from the switch, her quivering breast, watching the switch&#8217;s tip curling, flexing forward, she reflexively blinks as the thin hickory branch flicks into her titflesh, momentarily sinking into the tan nub of her nipple.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#8216;Thwack.&#8217;&nbsp; The sickening sound of hickory smacking damp flesh, her breast jerks, bounces as the thin crimson streak rises across the nipple.&nbsp; Eyes again reflexively squinting shut, the jolting pain ripping through her breast, the second sound of switch whistling through air&#8217;s immediate.&nbsp; The second &#8216;Thwack&#8217; of the hickory tearing into the outer side of&nbsp; her breast, the already throbbing nipple, her naked body gyrates, her head flailing back as both breasts bounce, slap together, sway to a jiggling standstill.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Barely able to catch her breath, hardly able to breath through the mucus trailing from her nostrils, she feels the jolting, pulsing pain of every pounding heartbeat in her twitching breasts.&nbsp; Blinking through her tears, glancing out over both lacerated breasts, her blurry eyes catch the switch being lowered, the dripping tip being aimed down toward her spread legs.&nbsp; A pleading grunt as she senses the slight droplets of brine flicking up across her inner thighs, into her gapping slit as he flicks his wrist back and forth, she reflexively tenses, attempts to pull her legs together, to somehow protect her vaginal area from the willowy branch as she gasps for breath while turning her head as far to the side as her craning neck allows.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#8216;Thwack&#8217;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The now almost uniform sound of wet hickory smacking across bare skin anywhere on her naked body, her head jerks back again as the searing pain rips across an inner thigh, the instant welt so high up on her glistening flesh it catches the outer edge of a labia fold.&nbsp; Gasping behind the tape, mucus continuously drooling from her flailing nostril, her body contorts, spasms in the creaking tape.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#8216;Thwack&#8217;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A second crisp flick of his wrist, matching unrelenting pain scorching her other thigh, her head jerks forward between her bouncing breasts.&nbsp; That welt just as high catching her puffy labium, her vaginal muscles reflexively quiver as moisture flicks off her twitching clithood. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#8216;Thwack!&#8217;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A harsher uppercut, the tip of the branch disappearing between the quivering folds, her naked body jerks upwards yet again, her breasts flailing, head jerking back as her guttural scream&#8217;s barely muffled by the taut tape.&nbsp; A crimson welt instantaneously mounting vertically upward from the dark tunnel of her sex to across her shaven pubic mound, the nub of her exposed clit taking on a brilliant reddish hue, her glistening body reflexively spasms as strands of loose hair spreads from the tight bun wrapped behind her head.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A hesitation, slowly turning, he once more steps toward the vat.&nbsp; Almost casually slipping the branch into the brine with the other switches, he turns back, gives her that still silent stare, turns the knob on the door.&nbsp; A slow back and forth nod of his head as his eyes lock with hers, the door opening, he steps out, shuts it behind him.
 
Chapter Two
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The pounding heartbeats in rapid succession sending throbbing jolts throughout her lashed breasts, her vagina, the burning sensations across the raw wounds, she stares blurry eyed toward the door, the image of his shadow disappearing from above the door jam.&nbsp; Tears flowing, mucus mixing as it drips from her taped chin; she again glances down toward the red welts, crisp, crisscrossing both nipples.&nbsp; Lower down, the pain even harsher, she senses her thighs still uncontrollably quivering, the sharp pain of both the welts and the salty vinegar solution nearly intolerable in her throbbing slit.&nbsp; Trying to set herself, to adjust her kneeling position on the wooden slates to spread her thighs wider, attempting to relieve the pulsing pain of those raised welts, she can only imagine of what&#8217;s to come, what&#8217;s in store for her when he returns.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Then comes the wait, the agonizing immeasurable span before he again presents himself. This time the waiting&#8217;s mixed with the already inflicted pain, even as it slowly recedes.&nbsp; On one hand it&#8217;s a momentary reprieve, yet on the other, it&#8217;s the anxiety of his return to inflict more punishment.&nbsp; Attempting to collect her breath, to breathe through clogged mucus, the moist tape still firmly sticking to her lips, cheeks, she inhales deeply, exhales likewise over and over trying to clear the passages of her flexing nostrils, her breasts rising, lowering in front of her downturned eyes as the lashed nipples burn as they painfully jiggle.&nbsp; Fingers flexing, spreading behind her, toes bent back by the wooden rails, her shoulders, back again aches, throbs from the unrelenting tape.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Almost certain its no coincidence she&#8217;s being so severely treated, the doubts in her mind, the thoughts of just how much he knows, it&#8217;s got to be the vacation, her few moments of indiscretions along with her friend&#8217;s urgings.&nbsp; But, how can he know?&nbsp; The silence, the long wait building as the pain finally subsides to a constant, more manageable ache throughout her body, she realizes there&#8217;s no adjusting to relieve the discomfort of her arched position.&nbsp; Trying to think, to formulate some sort of plan, to be able to answer whatever he&#8217;s at some point going to be asking her about, or even accusing her of, she can only wait, listen to her own pulsing heartbeat, her rasping breath, the stretching of the tape as she awkwardly shifts, stares toward the door.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Then, once more the slow footsteps, the shadow beneath the door, the knob turning.&nbsp; Again her heart pounding, crusting eyes widening, she stares toward his form entering the room.&nbsp; His demeanor unchanged, his stare a harsh look, her own eyes lower as her head turns ever so slightly. Stepping straight toward her, passing the brine bucket, something else glistens in his clenching fist.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Reaching out, a pair of coiled slender wires, one red the other black, their attached alligator clips in his fingertips reflects the light from above.&nbsp; Right nipple pinched across the welts, the serrated clamps gripping deep against the nub, she arches, grunts through the tape.&nbsp; The left nipple gripped, twisted, the bruised nub hardening beneath his pinching thumb and forefinger, he toys with the welts rising across the firm flesh, squeezing, tugging before finally sliding the spread clamp across that puckering flesh.&nbsp; Another reflexive buck from her abused body as it squeezes shut, the tip of her nipple bulging out from the serrated teeth, her guttural groan escapes the tape.
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;An exploratory tug of each wire, the clamps jerking one after the other at her contorting nipples, he allows the wires to unravel to the floor as he reaches deep down into a pocket.&nbsp; A second matching set of coiled wires, matching serrated clamps, he kneels, spreads the welted folds of her labium as he adjusts a clamp, clips it to the slender strip of flesh separating her rectum from her vagina.&nbsp; Thighs quivering, pubic mound jaunting outward, he ignores her squeal, grips the forth clamp.&nbsp; A glance into her anguished eyes, focusing back toward her vagina, pinching the swollen clit, slipping the jagged jaws of the&nbsp; clamp deep onto the pulsing nub, he releases his thumb, forefinger, allows the clamp to spring shut.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Tape stretching, body tensing, bowing, twisting as grunt after grunt after grunt spews saliva from behind the tape, he leans back, gives the bottom wires a not so gentle tug as her glistening body gyrates above the podium.&nbsp; Clit stretching, the rear clamp digging in, her rasping squeals again emit from the flexing tape.&nbsp; Allowing those wires to uncurl across the first pair, standing, again stepping silently toward the door, he doesn&#8217;t even look back at her contorting form as he exits the room while shutting the door behind him.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Gasping, wheezing as the clamps continue to burrow with each jerking movement, sharp, piercing pain throbbing throughout her breasts, her spread thighs, the stretching tapes scrape at her wrists, ankles, elbows as the tears flow off her cheeks, drips between her swaying breasts.&nbsp; The pain almost blinding, the foursome of serrated jaws jamming into the already raw wounds of her most sensitive flesh, white spots seem to flash across her blinking, squinting eyes as the tape refuses to tear from her chaffed wrists, ankles.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Wheezing, grunting, finally near exhaustion slumping back in her restraints, her fingernails leave imprints from digging into her ankles as she attempts to stiffen, to relieve the pain by bracing into her original arched, stationary form.&nbsp; The throbbing pain corresponding with each heartbeat, nipples and clit not only searing with the tension of the jiggling jagged clamps but also the brine soaked wounds, she somehow, someway, collects her breath with slower, longer inhalations of her practically clogged nostrils.&nbsp; Blinking, blinking and squinting over and over, clearing her welling eyes as much as possible, she blurredly stares toward the smoked portal, the door, then back toward the dark glass, not really caring if she&#8217;s being watched at this point.&nbsp; Then, the door opens, again.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Stepping in, a clumsy looking type device in his hands cupped down in front of him, he steps forward and sits it on the floor in front of her far away enough that her swollen eyes can still focus and make it out.&nbsp; Controls, dials on the mainly black box with glass gauges, fly-nut hookups for wires, she loses any hope that it&#8217;s not something to do with the wires clamped to her body.&nbsp; As he aligns the box to face her, individually attaches the wires one at a time to the connectors as the clamps tug at her nipples and between her thighs, rearing her head back, again she moans behind the masking tape as she realizes without a doubt what he&#8217;s doing.&nbsp; The box obviously electrical, the currents&#8217; going to be directed to the clamps, her nipples, and even worse, her clit.&nbsp; The wires attached, the box again shuffled just so, she tilts her head forward just as he flips the switch.&nbsp; Lights flashing on, glowing in a series, yellow above, red below, she reflexively braces as her welling eyes glance back and forth from his eyes back to the ominous instrument.
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Tinkering with a final adjustment, just the top row of four yellow lights glowing, he stands as he reaches out to each individual alligator clamp on her stretched body to give a final tug.&nbsp; The pain searing, still the sight of the box is even more terrifying, the threat of what&#8217;s about to be done to her by the attached wires.&nbsp; Turning away, he again exits and shuts the door behind him as she&#8217;s left alone with her thoughts, her fears.&nbsp; Glancing down from one breast to the other, the jiggling clamps drawing just specks of blood from the tips of each compressed nipple, moaning to herself her eyes focus on the lights, the four glowing yellow lights.&nbsp; Realizing with utter terror where all four wires are attached, she can only wait.

Part Two
Chapter One
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Waiting, continuously glancing back and forth toward the door, down toward the foursome of yellow lights glowing in a single row on the black metal box on the floor in front of her, the anxiety, anguish multiplies.&nbsp; Nipples oozing miniscule droplets of blood, the silver clamps on both quivering breasts becoming crimson tinged; the sharp pain throughout her naked body&#8217;s become a relentless steady ache.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The clamps and wires dangling with each labored breath, the agonizing sensations of her tortured nipples being tugged on time and again, she can barely imagine just how much more severe the pain can possibly be when the box is finally used on her.&nbsp; Faintly recalling any accidental electrical shocks in her past, concentrating, even going all the way back to being a child, her one recollection seems to be of utter uncontrollable pain practically paralyzing her.&nbsp; Focusing in on the dials, the buttons and knobs on the machine, she tries to rationalize to herself it couldn&#8217;t, shouldn&#8217;t be all that powerful, something that he would really hurt her with, then again, she&#8217;d never had her breasts or certainly her vagina treated so harshly by him, ever.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Studying the shadow less light filtering beneath the door while trying to also concentrate on the illuminated box, nothing but utter silence, she realizes that time can&#8217;t hardly be measured, it being anywhere from as little as fifteen minutes to maybe even close to an hour since the clips were clamped to her bare flesh.&nbsp; The tears randomly trickling down off her cheeks, dripping between her still thrust out breasts, another&nbsp; futile shift ever so slightly of her knees, wrists in the sticking tape, her eyes widen as she suddenly notices the series of yellow lights beginning to flicker for the first time.&nbsp; First one, then another, then a couple at a time, she finds herself reflexively straining, fists clenching behind her as she stares in dread at the flashing instrument seeming to come to life on its on.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Breathing becoming ever more stressful as her still moist nostrils begin to flair, her lips quivering behind the still adhering strip of tape across her mouth, she glares at three of the lights abruptly staying lit, the forth turning to a steady off and on cadence.&nbsp; A few seconds of the series of blinks and again her eyes widen as the red light directly below the flickering yellow flashes on, immediately alternating its cadence as the rest of the three yellow lights blink off.&nbsp; Gasping in a deep breath, attempting to hold it in as the lone yellow light blinks just a couple more times and stays off itself, her left breast lurches as if prodded with a red hot poker while the red light brightens, remains on.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Hoarsely grunting, nearly biting her tongue, her lips stretching wide at the taut tape, the sounds, the flashes of light swirling in her brain corresponds with an indescribable pain jolting throughout her chest.&nbsp; Bucking, rearing, uncontrollably contorting for two, three, four seconds, the red light finally blinks off, the row of all four yellow lights flashing back on.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Gasping for breath, mucus flowing down across the tape mixing with her tears, the clamp dripping blood as her singed breast sways to a standstill; her ears seem to continue to buzz as her blurry eyes glance down toward her throbbing nipple.&nbsp; Tongue sore from teeth marks, her lips able to spread just a tad wider in the stretched tape across her mouth, the constant thumping of her heartbeat causes the nipple clamps to jiggle in unison.&nbsp; Barely coherent, heart pounding, even the tape wrapping her wrists have begun to loosen from her contortions, if just some.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The door swinging open, she glances toward him stepping in.&nbsp; A small, three legged stool in his hand as he positions it to the side of her and beside the hellish box, she finds herself mumbling through her tears.&nbsp; Watching him flip a switch on the box, the lights flicking off, she senses a relief of sorts.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#8216;Okay.&#8217;&nbsp; His voice firm as he leans forward, he allows a finger to glide across the clamp that released the voltage to her still throbbing nipple.&nbsp; &#8216;I&#8217;ve got some questions, just nod or shake your head for now to answer me, understand?&#8217;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Seeing his other hand still on the toggle switch, glancing back toward his eyes, she slowly nods a couple short, crisp nods.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#8216;Now, I guess you&#8217;re wondering why this special workout?&#8217; His voice still firm while he leans back as he draws away from the clamp, he continues without awaiting a nodding answer.&nbsp; &#8216;I have reason to have serious questions about what went on while you were down in Florida; I can&#8217;t help wondering about your behavior down there with your friend, the two of you.&#8217;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The pain still pulsing throughout her ravaged body, now the anguish of being confronted about her escapade just like she hoped wasn&#8217;t going to happen, she senses her face reddening, the crimson shade corresponding with the spreading warmth as she flushes.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#8216;Here&#8217;s what we&#8217;re going to do.&#8217;&nbsp; His hand still on the toggle, flicking it on, off, on and finally off again, he watches her eyes, the welling tears still dripping down her cheek as her naked body flinches with each &#8216;click&#8217;.&nbsp; &#8216;I&#8217;m going to ask you a few questions, If I find out you&#8217;re not being honest, that single jolt&#8217;s going to become a long series of jolts, and not just on a tit, understand?&#8217;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A brief hesitation, then her head nodding ever so slowly, her body visually tenses as the clamps jiggle above the wires dangling down out in front of her.&nbsp; Still struggling to breath through her flailing nostrils, hoping against hope he&#8217;ll remove the tape, she can only grunt and squint as she stares toward him.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#8216;Uncomfortable?&nbsp; Oh, well.&#8217;&nbsp; He smiles a slight smirk as he clasps his hands together in front of him, interlocks his fingers as he leans forward toward her.&nbsp; &#8216;Okay, right off, first question.&nbsp; Did you fuck around on me?&#8217;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Crusting eyes widening, fists clenching behind her back as she grunts, she finds herself shaking her head from side to side.&nbsp; The warmth across her face heating up, realizing she&#8217;s being asked the one question she fears the most, the pain of the jiggling clamps escalate as she again reflexively stiffens.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#8216;Really?&nbsp; No, huh?&#8217;&nbsp; His head slowly shaking back and forth also, his response to her answer dripping with sarcasm, he allows one hand to rest palm down on his knee as his other hand again rests on a toggle switch.&nbsp; &#8216;Well, did the two of you hook up with any guys down there, I mean for any reason?&#8217;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Again a hesitation, heart pounding harder and harder, the physical pain now being overshadowed by the mental stress, the anguish of having to lie, of watching his finger gripping that switch, she again shakes her head from side to side, sticking with what he appears to know is an obvious lie.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#8216;No guys, no fucking around.&nbsp; Two girls, good looking girls with big titties hanging out of those thong bikinis during spring break and no guys could find any interest in the two of you, huh?&nbsp; That right?&#8217;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Reaching up his hand, a thumb and a couple fingers clawing at the end of the tape across her cheek, a quick, harsh tug and it tears free across her stretching lips.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#8216;Oooohhhh!&#8217;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#8216;Now only speak, only answer when I ask.&#8217;&nbsp; He instructs as he continues to finger the switch on the black box and wires.&nbsp; &#8216;One word otherwise and I&#8217;ll jolt your tits and clit for thirty straight seconds or maybe more, that initial one was only less then five, understand?&#8217;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Her tongue sore, feeling swollen from her teeth uncontrollably clenching during the electrical shock, lips burning, probably chaffed raw from the sticky tape, she nods, mumbles under her breath.&nbsp; &#8216;Yea, yes Sir.&#8217;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Watching her taking a couple deep, fresh but nervous breaths, her stomach muscles flexing beneath her arched ribcage, the clamps jiggling off each nipple of her swaying breasts, the other clamps dangling from down between her spread thighs, he again slips his fingers away from the box as his voice becomes almost quiet, soothing.&nbsp; &#8216;Now, the truth, the total truth, I want to hear it all.&nbsp; Tell me the truth now.&#8217;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#8216;I, I promise, we, we didn&#8217;t do nothing bad while we were down there, promise.&#8217;&nbsp; Hearing her own raising voice, trying not so well to let her tone give away her lies, she focuses past the gripping clamps, past him to the smoked mirror.&nbsp; &#8216;I, we didn&#8217;t want to take any chances of being propositioned or anything so, so we, we just stayed together all alone and went to the beach together, honest.&nbsp; That&#8217;s the truth, you, you can ask her if you don&#8217;t believe me, you can.&#8217;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#8216;One more time, one last chance.&#8217;&nbsp; His voice again alternating to the stricter, almost cold tone, his fingers once more reaching to the electrical box, he nods.&nbsp; &#8216;Well?&#8217;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#8216;I swear, I, I do, I do swear!&#8217;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Flicking the switch upward, adjusting some sort of dial that resembles a timer to her, standing, the four yellow lights glowing, he reaches in his pocket, tugs out a sort of horse bit.&nbsp; Reaching over, slipping it between her lips, fastening its dangling straps behind her head, he grabs the stool, steps toward the door.&nbsp; &#8216;You&#8217;ll need that to protect your tongue for the next half hour or so.&#8217;&nbsp; A hesitation, he smirks.&nbsp; &#8216;By the way, how &#8216;bout the Surfer boys, and know what?&nbsp;&nbsp; I did ask her.&nbsp; Think about that while the box helps refresh your memory.&#8217;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The door shutting behind him, she stares through the foggy tears toward the door, back down toward the glowing lights on the box.&nbsp; Again the thoughts swirling, her heartbeat thumping beneath her twitching breasts, she replays his words ringing in her ears, &#8216;surfer boys&#8217;.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The yellow lights starting to blink in random sequences catching her attention, the wires leading toward the clamps twitching from her nipples, she senses the leather bit between her teeth compressing, flattening across her tongue even as her body tenses.&nbsp; The initial yellow bulb continuing to blink as the other three darken, the corresponding red light beneath once more flashing on and off, she can&#8217;t help focusing on her jiggling nipple, the one already jolted initially.&nbsp; Holding her breath in, gnawing on the bit, her heart thumps, pounds in her chest as the yellow light blinks ominously off.&nbsp; Fists tensing, toes scraping back against the wooden surface beneath her spread legs, the searing pain jolts through her jerking breast, the clamp bouncing with her twisting nipple as saliva spews from the corners of her lips.&nbsp; The two, then three second burst as harsh as the initial jolt, her head rears back as the red light fades.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Attempting to somehow catch her breath, feeling like she&#8217;d been punched in the stomach, actually much worse, ears ringing, her breast swaying, jiggling to a standstill, her tortured nipple throbs beneath the heated clamp.&nbsp; Grunting as she gasps, eyes swollen, staring down toward the wired machine, the row of yellow lights once again initiate a random series of blinks.&nbsp; More gnawing, grunting on the rawhide gag as she again tenses, tugs, twists at the tape holding her wrists, ankles so tautly, she glares toward the smoked glass beside the door, back toward the hellish blinking lights above the blank row of red bulbs beneath.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Blinking, flashing, one bulb, all four, a couple at a time seeming without rhyme or reason, then suddenly, the end bulb continues to blink as the others fade into darkness.&nbsp; Another deep inhalation, clamps jiggling on her twisting nipples above the swaying wires, she focuses on the row of red lights with her perspiration soaked body stiffening.&nbsp; The yellow bulb flashing off, back on, off, back on, off, on, off, on, a nervous, harsh exhalation with saliva spewing off her stretched lips, another deep inhalation with eyes riveted to the yellow light, the blank red bulb beneath it, even in her frantic state of mind she realizes somewhere else on her naked body is about to be jolted, but where?
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;All four yellow bulbs again springing to life, the random flashes, the red lights remain dark.&nbsp; A couple amber bulbs at a time, singular, all four, her chest seems to pound in cadence with the lights as she tears at the tape, twists her raw wrists, tugs as she jerks, all useless, just that much more painful with the flailing clamps.&nbsp; Finally grunting out a breath, head tilting forward as her face presses down between her swaying breasts, the wired clamps jiggling beside either cheek; she again raises her eyes toward the electrical box, toward yet another yellow bulb flashing alone as the others all darken.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mentally drained, almost hopelessly gazing through her tears toward the box, the red light flashing on beneath its counterpart, she barely braces as the yellow fades off.&nbsp; The red flashing just a couple extra pulses, her body jerks upwards as the jolting shock resonates between her contorting thighs.&nbsp; A red hot poker, even a sledgehammer, something worse, two again three seconds that seem like an eternity of excruciating agony, her teeth sink into the leather gag, her eyes roll back past her straining, blinking eyelids with the harsh buzzing resonating between her ears.
Uncontrollably stiffening into an obscene arch, then just as harshly slumping forward in the restraints, head almost dangling as a steady sliver of drool escapes her spread lips, wheezing as her thighs quiver, spasm randomly, her thoughts are momentarily incoherent, just the pulsing burning deep in her bowels keeping her conscious.
The door swinging open, he steps forward with stool in hand, toward the box, her.&nbsp; Flicking the switch, the lights all illuminating, flashing in unison, blinking off, he slides an open palm beneath her chin as he sits on the stool, raises her head.&nbsp; Her face flushed, eyes darkened as much as swollen, he stares into her nearly blank expression.
&#8216;Now, let&#8217;s hear about your &#8216;surfer guys&#8217;.&nbsp; His voice even keeled, not harsh, yet not sympathetic, he glances toward the box, toward the foursome of clamps on her glistening flesh while he reaches out, tugs almost gently on one compressing a nipple.&nbsp; &#8216;I want the truth, I want to hear everything just like your friend admitted to, otherwise we&#8217;ll continue with the box turned back on until you decide otherwise, hear me?&#8217;
Slowly understanding his words, his voice like a distant echo in her ringing ears, she gazes through hazed eyes up toward his look, nods her head, if just barely.
&#8216;One lie, just one little, tiny lie that doesn&#8217;t add up and the jolts will be twice as long and with a couple of the clamps at a time, understand?&#8217;
Her eyes widening as she understands the threat, her head twisting back and forth on her craning neck, she senses his cupping hand sliding up across her cheek, unfastening the horse bit. Coughing, spewing spittle, she watches as he leans back, slips a couple fingers on the box&#8217;s toggle switch.
&#8216;Now, let&#8217;s begin. Start with when and how you met your &#8216;surfer guys.&#8217;
