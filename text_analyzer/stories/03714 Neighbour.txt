Neighbour

Synopsis: Couple discovers new neighbour and have fun filled evening.We were just going out, and in the passing saw a man. Neighbour. Interesting,
  neighbour! Older gentleman, on the rough side, tinkering around his (I assume)
  car, wearing jeans and T-shirt. Nice salt-n-pepper hair sporting a neat haircut,
  50-ish I would say, but � arms!&nbsp;Wow! We both just exhaled and simply said: �Nice!� Big,
  muscular arms on the obviously nicely- maintained, hard body � lots of art
  on that skin � instant moisture. 
Later that week, coming home from work, checking the mail, I saw him again.&nbsp;On
  impulse, I'm walking towards him both confidently and aggressively, with my
  head held high, stepping just a bit carefully in the �office only� stilettos.
  He sees me and gives me an inquiring look, waiting as I approach.&nbsp;A vixen
  smile on my face, my eyes green as they can get only when I'm up to no good,
  I stick my hand out. 
�Hi!&nbsp;I'm fairly new here in the neighbourhood, thought to stop and introduce
  myself. Haven't seen you around before�.&nbsp;
He gives me an appraising look. An amused smile tickles his eyes.&nbsp;His
  handshake is strong, but not painful.&nbsp;He isn't trying to show me he can
  crush me, though he isn't sparing me either. The contact lasts a bit longer
  than it should. His voice is low and warm. 
�Hi, nice to meet you.&nbsp;Nice of you to come around � Not everyone is � this
  ... friendly!�&nbsp;
I respond with a low chuckle and an obvious apprising look, lingering on his
  arms for a moment. 
�I'm not always � this friendly either.&nbsp;But I just had to � I hope you
  don't mind me saying; nice art, and � nice arms� 
He is standing there, our eyes meet and I know he is wondering if he should
  just gracefully accept the complement, or � 
�You like!?�&nbsp;Finally comes out, something between question and statement. 
Is he going to be brave? I'm not breaking eye contact, my eyes still smiling,
  my heart pounding.&nbsp;It has been a while since I played these games.&nbsp;Fuck,
  it feels so damn good.&nbsp;His low vibrating voice brings me closer to him. 
�How much � do you like?� 
�How � hard do you want to know?� 
Pause.&nbsp;We're not smiling any more.&nbsp;The moment is frozen while I
  feel his heat moving towards me.&nbsp;My heart skipping a beat, I can almost
  hear his heartbeat.&nbsp;I can see it in his throat. I can smell him.&nbsp;Warm.&nbsp;Sharp.&nbsp;
I smile and take a step back. 
�We're in unit #77. My husband is home usually around 6. Why don't you stop
  by, some time?&nbsp;Say 7 - 7.30, for a beer.&nbsp;That would be nice!� 
He smiles and nods. 
�Thank you.&nbsp;I'll take you up on that one.&nbsp;Man can't turn down a
  beer, not in this heat!&nbsp;See you around.� 
I nod, smile, give those bunched-up muscles one last glance, slowly turn around
  and stroll back home.&nbsp;No, I did not swing my hips more than usually.&nbsp;Well,
  maybe, just a bit! 
Few days later, bloody heat!&nbsp;We're in the backyard, digesting supper
  and breathing through gills, what did the Gods have in mind when they designed
  this place?&nbsp;I'm loosely wrapped in a light cotton �sheet�, resembling
  a mixed-breed between flower child and native of some exotic tropical island.
  I have a tall glass of ice water in my hand, running it over my exposed skin
  from time to time, while you doze off with a beer by your side. 
The door-bell tears my attention away from the steamy vampire in my book,
  and I wonder where my child is �. Do I have to get up?&nbsp;You give me sad
  puppy eyes and with a sigh I get up, gathering the loose ends of my �dress� around
  me.&nbsp;I open the door. 
�Hi!&nbsp;I thought to take you up on that invite, unless this is bad time
  for you?� 
He is grinning widely at my choice of clothing, while my cheeks get increasingly
  hotter.&nbsp;I smile, a bit embarrassed, and step back opening the door invitingly. 
�No, no � it's not a bad time! Just � hot!&nbsp;Please come in, straight through,
  we were in the backyard. Please, do come in.&nbsp;&nbsp;I'll&nbsp;change into
  something � more appropriate!� 
Appraising my lack of clothing, he chuckles. 
�Don't! I mean, don't change on my account.&nbsp;I like it.&nbsp;It looks
  good on you, and it's obviously comfortable.&nbsp;Well as comfortable as one
  can get right now.� 
I feel myself blushing furiously, as I smile embarrassed, lowering my head
  and gaze not quite sure how to proceed.&nbsp;I walk towards the backyard, guiding
  our guest your way, calling for you.&nbsp;You stand up and extend your hand
  to him in friendly welcome.&nbsp;I introduce you, and turn back to get beers
  and some snacks for him.&nbsp;As you get involved in amicable conversation,
  getting to know each other, discussing weather and jobs, I sit in the corner
  with my water, listening at the discussion and enjoying the view.&nbsp;The
  evening passes fast in relaxed conversation.&nbsp;He is nice, intelligent,
  experienced, funny and enjoyable to spend time with.&nbsp;Long after our normal
  bedtime, we see him out with the promise of meeting again soon.&nbsp;You tease
  me to the bedroom, making comments about my lustful looks and �drooling� over
  another man.&nbsp;We fuck. Quite satisfactory! 
The rest of the week goes by, uneventful.&nbsp;The highlight is a kids' sleep-over
  on Friday night! Hee hee � childless - what an event!&nbsp;But, on Friday?&nbsp;We
  make it home and despite my resolve to stay up, shortly after supper I feel
  unusually sleepy.&nbsp;You encourage me to go to bed and I drag myself up,
  decide to take a quick shower, then decide in favour of brushing teeth. Ahhh
  what a chore! I collapse on our bed.&nbsp;Blessed silence.&nbsp;Now if I could
  just have some wet dream �A la carte� � wishful thinking � soft darkness embraces
  me. 
I wake up � I'm waking up � fighting fog � thick darkness � something isn't
  right � this was not right� sleep � not dream � too many hands � what!? 
I feel my head hanging from the bed, smell man, thick cock forcing itself
  in my throat. Trying to stop him. Trying to move my hands.&nbsp;Can't!&nbsp;My
  hands are restrained. I feel leather handcuffs on them, locked to the spreader-bar
  which is locked to my legs.&nbsp;My eyes are open now.&nbsp;The room is in
  the soft light of the candles.&nbsp;I stare at the balls approaching my face,
  tight muscular thighs, under side of clenching arse.&nbsp;I feel someone eating
  me up.&nbsp;Slow, deliberate licks and suckling on the clit.&nbsp;Too much!
  Too deep! I try to move away, � but he is pushing, working his way into my
  throat. 
�Yes! Good! You are awake.&nbsp;Swallow!&nbsp;Swallow me!&nbsp;Easy � take
  it, c'mon, take it all the way!&nbsp;That's good, yes! Oh yes! That feels nice!
  Good girl! Keep swallowing� 
I recognize the voice, now the smell hits me too. Him!&nbsp;My God! What?&nbsp;It
  feels so good! He tastes so right!&nbsp;Concentrate to swallow.&nbsp;Concentrate
  to breathe. Keep the stomach down.&nbsp;He is so deep!&nbsp;With small movements
  he brings himself to the verge, to the brink.&nbsp;I can see his balls contracting,
  ready to deliver.&nbsp;But he just holds still. 
�Yes! That's good, baby!&nbsp;Don't move!&nbsp;That's nice!&nbsp;I'll let
  you breathe in a moment � mmmmm� good�� 
He withdraws, grabbing his shaft tightly with his hand, squeezing the clear
  droplet of pre-cum on my lips.&nbsp;As I gasp for air, I look at him; looking
  upwards over his stomach, chest.&nbsp;He has that wicked grin on his face � 
You are between my legs, still working me, playing in my tender flesh.&nbsp;I
  can't take my eyes off him.&nbsp;He moves slowly, lowering himself, cradling
  my head and his mouth meets mine in a long exploring kiss.&nbsp;
He says, �I was promised to have you any way I want!� and grins. 
You get up, wiping your face with the back of your hand and smile.&nbsp;You
  move to the side of the bed as he walks around and mounts me.&nbsp;I can feel
  his heat, his weight as he teases my soaking cunt with the tip of his hard
  meat.&nbsp;I'm wide open, but can't move. I'm looking at his muscles bulging
  and dancing as he moves above me. 
�I need to touch you! Untie me!� I growl. 
He looks at you and you nod. He reaches for the buckle on the cuff.&nbsp;You
  grin and say, �No! Leave the cuffs on for her, just undo the clasp!&nbsp;She
  likes the leather!� 
I suck in air, hearing you say it.&nbsp;It brings me to next level of high.&nbsp;I
  love you. I love you for knowing me! 
My hands and feet free, I open myself to him.&nbsp;He's still hovering just
  beyond the reach, and I grope for his arms.&nbsp;I'm drawn to the stone-hard
  flesh, I need to touch, feel, taste...&nbsp;He is immobile above me, in a curious
  push-up, waiting to see what I will do. All the restraint, all the reason has
  left me.&nbsp;There is only lust and the need for flesh!&nbsp;I pull myself
  up, to be able to taste his skin, to trace the ink with my tongue.&nbsp;I close
  my eyes as I inhale the scent from his hot skin, as I wrap my legs around his
  waist and rub my sleek wetness against his hard rod. 
He lowers himself to his elbow, cradling my head in his hand, giving me full
  access to his biceps. I rub my face in that living stone and attempt to sink
  my teeth into it.&nbsp;He sucks breath in sharply as I bite, and in the next
  moment impales me fully on his swollen member.&nbsp;At this fullness, my head
  flies backward and I reach behind me, knowing you are there, waiting, ready
  to feed me, to fill me on this end.&nbsp;Your familiar silky bulb slides into
  my welcoming mouth, cutting my moans.&nbsp;
I squeeze my hand between your legs and grab a hold of your silken balls,
  playing with them, having them slip and slide in the loose sack as I suck on
  your hard meat.&nbsp;You are finding the rhythm, and soon both of you thrust
  at the same time, filling me simultaneously, pushing me higher and higher towards
  the peak.&nbsp;His hot mouth latches on my nipple and I get lost in the sensory-input
  overload.&nbsp;I am nothing but a tangle of nerve endings being played by two
  lifelines. I have never felt so alive! 
As my tremors quiet, both of you stand at a halt, still in me, waiting for
  me to come down, to be ready for more.&nbsp;And that I am; ready for more.&nbsp;Needing
  more!&nbsp;As if on a cue, both of you withdraw, simultaneously, and he slaps
  my butt: 
�Turn over, on all fours!� 
I comply as you slide underneath me and pull my head down to your lap.&nbsp;You
  hold your cock out of the way and direct my mouth to your sensitive balls.&nbsp;I
  close my eyes and start licking and suckling you as I know you like it, feeling
  his hands playing on my tingling cunt.&nbsp;
�You are so wet.&nbsp;You do like this, don't you?� he is cooing bent over
  me, close to my ear.&nbsp;He brings his slick hand to my face. 
�Look at it!&nbsp;Look how wet you are!� hot whisper is tickling my face while
  my nose gets filled by a mix of our scents; my cum on his fingers and your
  precum on yours.&nbsp;I close my eyes and concentrate on the feeling of your
  balls sliding in and out of my mouth, hearing you whimper and moan.&nbsp;
He shifts behind me and buries his shaft to the hilt, meeting no resistance
  in my soaking slit. He pumps me slowly, sliding in and out, completely out,
  spreading my copious moisture all over, over himself, over my thighs, the crack
  of my arse.&nbsp;Without a warning, I feel new intrusion as he forces his finger
  up my asshole.&nbsp;I try to raise, turn my head, protest, but you were ready
  and you hold my head down, buried in your crotch.&nbsp;
There must be a nerve that goes straight from my back hole to my clit, because
  with every movement of his finger my clit throbs and twitches.&nbsp;I am torn
  between wanting to stop him and needing to surrender to his touch.&nbsp;He
  vacates my ass and a moment later I feel cold lube sliding down my crack.&nbsp;I
  shake my head ~ No!~ but you both ignore me.&nbsp;You allow me to lift my head
  just enough to slide your bursting cock in my mouth, successfully silencing
  me, while he gently but persistently works his fingers in and out of me, his
  shaft still buried deep in my soaking pussy. 
�Nice. Relax � That's good. I will get there one way or the other, so, relax,
  make it pleasurable for all of us, OK? You are so sweet, baby!&nbsp;Real sweet.&nbsp;My
  oh my, that is one nice tight ass here!&nbsp;I am going to have so much fun
  fucking it! I want to fill you up, I want to empty my balls deep, deep in you!� 
My ass fights intrusion, clenching on his fingers, while I'm starting to choke
  on your cock, fighting the shame suddenly rising in me.&nbsp;I don't know him!
  This stranger, so intimately exploring parts of me even you rarely get access
  to. What is he thinking? What will you think? This cannot be good! But, deep,
  deep inside me, I know the answer.&nbsp;Right or wrong, that doesn't matter
  now. Too far gone! Too deep, too high! 
His hands resting on my ass cheeks, he slowly pushes both of his thumbs inside,
  and stretches my sphincter.&nbsp;Momentarily pain shoots and I scream in outrage
  around your cock.&nbsp;Only gurgling comes out as you seize the moment to enter
  my wide- open throat. I would move away from him but have nowhere to go, my
  nose in your crotch, your shaft cutting my air. 
He slides out of my pussy and I feel him entering my ass.&nbsp;You pull out,
  allowing me a gulp of much needed air, and I breathe, trying to get ahold of
  my body, my emotions, of me.&nbsp;I am perfectly still, praying that he stays
  that way too, hoping that he will allow me to do this on my terms, at my pace.&nbsp;And
  he does.&nbsp;The wide head of his cock is sitting just past my pulsing sphincter,
  knowing there is another, strong and tight barrier. 
�Shhh� It's OK baby. I can wait. Breathe through it.� His voice is kind and
  calming, his hands caressing my hips. �Push at me � let me in �� and I do.&nbsp;I
  start rocking, pushing against him, opening myself. Pain lances through my
  insides; I take a deep breath, he is big, and I push, and he slides in � all
  the way in.&nbsp;My ass clenching on the intruder, adjusting to the stretch.
  My cunt pulsing, dripping, grasping for something.&nbsp;
He starts to move, slow sliding out, back in, out again � Goosebumps all over
  my skin. I'm slowly suckling on the tip of your cock, when he slams in me,
  reaching for my arms, pulling me up, back to his lap, pushing my legs wide
  open with his knees. 
�Get beneath her, she wants you inside too.&nbsp;Don't you baby?� he says
  licking my earlobe. The tremor passes over my body. My eyes shut I nod and
  you slide between his legs, your hard-on pressing against my pelvis.&nbsp;I
  have never felt you this hard! You reach for me, your hands on my breasts,
  supporting me as he lifts us both and leads you to the entrance.&nbsp;As we
  lower ourselves, you slide into my needing, throbbing hole and pull me lower,
  feeding my hard nipple to your hot mouth. 
�Stay still� he says to both of us, as he starts pumping, slowly but increasingly
  faster and harder. My ass is clenching around him, my cunt is milking you at
  the same time.&nbsp;I can feel you two rubbing each other through the thin
  membrane separating you. His grip on my hips gets harder, it hurts so comforting!&nbsp;You
  crash my tits together sucking hard on both nipples at the same time.&nbsp;I � ride
  the wave! 
Air is hot, it has become hard to breathe.&nbsp;You groan, he hisses!&nbsp;I
  hold my breath and disappear - I am a part of you, connected to him, raw, boiling,
  clenching, pulsing, overflowing �I feel you move and grunt, I feel him stiffen
  inside and I am flooded with hot juices. I exhale the scream, shivering on
  top of you, exploding inside. I collapse, listening to the frantic beat deep
  in your chest, feeling my own heartbeat in my temples and his in my ass.&nbsp;
As both of you grow soft I try to slip to the side, but he stops me, still
  buried deep inside. 
�I'm not done.&nbsp;There is one more thing I need to do.�&nbsp;I look at
  you enquiringly and you pull me up to a kiss.&nbsp;You kiss me deep and tender,
  your hand clutched in my hair, holding me in loving embrace.&nbsp;He relaxes
  and I feel a hot stream filling my bowels. Screaming my passion into your mouth,
  I cum. Again.
