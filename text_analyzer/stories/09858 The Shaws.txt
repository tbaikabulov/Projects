The Family Shaw.

This wicked tale is set mostly in the North-West of England and starts in January 1820. This was not a good time to be poor in England, and a great, great many people were poor. Mad King George 111 died on the 29th of the month and his son became George 1V. The extent of civil unrest in the, newly, United Kingdom at that time was very much greater than is commonly realised and in the 12 months either side of January 1820 a total well in excess of 100 citizens would die and many more than 1,000 would be injured in riots and in the use of militia and cavalry to subdue, in Edmund Burke's phrase the 'swinish multitude'.&nbsp; The end of the Napoleonic Wars, at the Battle of Waterloo, was only 5 years before and there were very many unemployed former sailors and soldiers who had been dismissed from King George's service. The progress of the industrial revolution was also having a great effect on the daily life of a large number of people. In the North-West of England the moist atmospheric conditions were almost perfect for weaving and there was a history of large halls where skilled weavers worked at their individual looms and earned a reasonable wage. There was such a history but, with the harnessing of steam power and the invention of power looms this way of life was coming to an end. One man could now supervise several looms and the unwanted weavers were unceremoniously sacked. Their wages had been halved over the previous few years in any event. The Corn Laws were still in effect and harvests had been poor. There was a shortage of corn and a great many people were unable to feed themselves and their families. It might have been thought that a new King's accession would, for a short period at least, have given the masses a hope that things might improve but the new King had been Regent for ten years and there was no hope for any relief from oppression, drudgery and hunger for the masses.&nbsp; There were many consequences of this but we shall explore some of these later.

For the poor people, more than 90% of the population, there was a deep recession (over the next 4 years prices would drop by a third!). Wages were dropping even more rapidly since there were large numbers of people looking for every job. Government presided over this state but did not feel it had any obligation to try to change it and very few politicians had any concern for the poor. A warped version of utilitarianism, commitment to a free market economy and the ideas of&nbsp; Rev. T. R. Malthus were in vogue. Anyway none of these wretches could vote, since there was a minimum property ownership qualification, and government was of the rich, for the rich and by the rich. The common people had had enough of high sounding speeches from would be politicians who had no intention of ever seeking change if they secured office. To paraphrase Edmund Burke these men were hypocrites and so could make the highest promises of which they could conceive since they had no intention of ever carrying them out. In the parliamentary constituency of Burgh the elected member was Sir Geoffrey Shaw who at 35 was seen as a rising star of the ruling Tory party.&nbsp; As befitted a successful politician he was married and his wife, Rose, was the only child of a local aristocratic family. Her father was Walter Bruys, The 14th Earl of Kirkbride and her family had a magnificent history certainly going back to the Wars of the Roses. The family was now virtually impoverished and every item they owned was mortgaged. The Shaw family was in a very different financial league. Three generations ago they had raised themselves from the common herd by dint of hard work and astute trading. They secured the co-operation of three other, would be wealthy, families and banded together to outfit a ship which they sailed from Liverpool on the triangular trade. Baubles and trade goods out to Africa, slaves across to the Indies and Americas then sugar, tobacco and cotton back to Liverpool. After the first, extremely successful and profitable trip, they used all their part of the proceeds to outfit a second trip on their own account. This time they bought their first plantation in Jamaica with part of the proceeds. A third trip saw the purchase of large tracts of land and the funding of mines in England. The&nbsp; fourth and fifth trips ensured that their family would have all the advantages money could secure. These trips took place between 1760 and 1765. Sir Geoffrey's father was born in 1760 and, in 1790, when the creator of the original wealth died, at the age of 65, Geoffrey's father purchased a Baronetcy. This is an old, hereditary, title set between the nobility and the knighthood. Since the time of James 1 (V1 of Scotland) it had been a source of income to the crown. While the common masses acknowledged the title the aristocracy looked down their noses at the upstarts. Sir Geoffrey's father died in 1815.

Continuous astute handling of the family affairs at a time when opportunities for substantial economic gains abounded&nbsp; had seen the star of the Shaw family soar and the true magnitude of their accumulated wealth was not commonly appreciated. In addition to a wife Sir Geoffrey had two younger brothers and their names were James and George. While the nobility would scrimp to buy their eldest son a commission in the army or secure a post in the navy a family which had secured it's advancement through shrewd commercial dealings appreciated the value of education. To that end Sir Geoffrey had an excellent classical education, James was a doctor of medicine and George a minister of the Church of England. There was another branch of the family and they were the children of Sir Geoffrey's aunt whose married name was Fletcher. The elder of these, Michael, who was the same age as Geoffrey, managed the family interests in Jamaica while the younger, Steven, was a highly respected and astute local solicitor. So successful had the Shaw family been in their acquisitions that they owned they whole area of the town of&nbsp; Burgh and all but a very few of the farms for about 10 miles in all directions. Only the family knew, however, that Geoffrey had been working since the day he married to buy up all the debts and mortgages of his in-laws. He was sure that his wife had only consented to their marriage because she would properly be styled Lady Shaw and would live in comfort. The security of having her parent's fate in his hands he considered to be a sound precaution. 

It was the receipt of the quarterly Jamaica accounts, and a letter from Michael, which triggered the events that saw the family descend into behaviour which eventually would challenge the libertines of the Marquis de Sade in their perversity and evil. All of the family were personally extremely wealthy and the incomes from their multitudes of properties were shared amongst them. Michael had control of all their West Indies interests which extended to 3 plantations, sugar presses, docks etc. and he lived in sumptuous elegance. The total number of slaves approached a thousand and his household retinue alone was 40. All these expenses were borne as a cost of the enterprise and Michael's 20% of the net profits of the Indies enterprises was available to him for investment in private pursuits. This was a very substantial sum. The Burgh Shaws always had a meeting when the quarterly returns from the Indies were received and the 1820 February meeting was held in Sir Geoffrey's home. As usual&nbsp; Lady Shaw was not at home and was visiting her parents. Sir Geoffrey's home, Burgh Manor, was a 15 year old 16 room mansion in its own grounds of 4 acres on the outskirts of Burgh. He had 12 servants all of whom, except for a couple of low level maids, had served the family for several years. Lady Shaw had, of course, taken her personal maid, carriage driver and footman with her so 9 were left in Burgh Manor. After a meal, which was relatively modest for personages of that status at that time, but would still have fed some 50 or so, the gentlemen retired to the smoking room to conduct their business. Michael had, as was usual, written to his brother who, in close conjunction with Sir Geoffrey, in practice oversaw all the family businesses.

 As was normal port and cigars were taken and Sir Geoffrey began the business by excusing the servants and, when they were alone, said 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Right lads we have Michaels report so, Steven, over to you.�
 In their private dealings the Shaws neither beat about the bush nor adopted grand manners. Steven immediately went into the Jamaica accounts.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�We all know the form these take so the gross trading profit for the quarter was �78,000, the net trading profit was �65,000. The capital value of the investment is �850,000 and that is an increase in �112,000 in comparison with the winter quarter for 1818. Any questions?�, he said.
 At this he passed round copies of a one page extract of the accounts for the others to see. The brothers looked over the figures with experienced eyes. 
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I see Michael is living well,� said James and, as he saw Steven about to intercede on his brother's behalf, raised his hand slightly and continued �however I must say that with the work he has done on all our behalves he is worth every penny. I would like to move acceptance of the accounts and that we send a letter to cousin Michael with our heartiest greetings and grateful thanks for his efforts.�
This was met with the full agreement of all the family. After a couple of minutes George casually asked, 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Do we have any other business tonight?�

The split up of the British enterprises profits was different. Steven charged for his services at full price and received free use of premises for his legal practice as well as certain other small perquisites within the family's gift. Sir Geoffrey had 50% of the net income in recognition of his need to maintain an imposing presence and the younger brothers each 25% of the net. This meant that Sir Geoffrey had an income well in excess of �200,000 per annum. (To get an idea of the current equivalent value multiply all sums by a little over 40!) 

Sir Geoffrey replied to George's question with,
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Yes. Steven and I have discussed this fully and we shall be closing the weaving halls. A new set of Mr William Horrock's most modern powered looms will be installed in a new factory. These will be supplied by power from a steam engine to be supplied by Mr William Sims and will be the most up to date, and profitable, in Europe. This all will be built on the land at the rear of the existing hall. The profits which this will generate should pay for the change over inside three years. We have not, as yet, made any decision regarding the disposition of the exiting halls but it will take at least nine months to achieve the hand over of production. Any thoughts either of you have would be welcome. Perhaps at our next meeting.� 
The brothers nodded their agreement.&nbsp; Steven then said, 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Sorry to have to introduce a negative note but the costs of poor relief are rising rapidly and if we are not careful they will soon impact on our incomes.�
 James and George were well aware of the problems which the masses of the population were facing and also knew that the weaving machines proposal would make them worse. They chose to say nothing but again merely nodded in acknowledgement of Steven's comment as they savoured the fresh cigars which had come with Michael's letter.

A short period of silent contemplation followed then Steven said,
�As usual Michael sent a letter with the quarterly accounts. It's a bit different from his usual but you may find it interesting.� 

Michael's Letter -

Steven, 
Hello brother. Thanks for your letter about the last meeting I'm glad that the family are pleased with progress. Hope everyone is well. Tell the cousins that I am asking after them and hope that Sir Geoffrey has brought that high born bitch of his to heel. The latest accounts seem to me to be healthy and the profits are well up from this time last year. The new plantation will be in full production by the last quarter of 1820 so the medium term prospects look most promising. Property values here&nbsp; are holding up well and now that we export to all of the continent the long term looks good too. The one problem which I can see is to know when these Whig do gooders will abolish slavery in the colonies like it was back in '72 at home. There seems to be no move towards this in the Southern United States so it may be a sound idea to move our investments to there over the next few years. I am already investing modestly there myself and, as you will find out from what follows. I have made a most fortunate contact and will give you full report of a visit I shall be making to the United States over the next few weeks as soon as I can.
 
Had a most interesting diversion last week. One of the field slaves, a moderately valuable female of 22 years, ran off. It seems she wanted to try to follow her 'husband' who we had sold to a cotton plantation in Mississippi a month before. She got all of 15 miles before the dogs caught her. She had no idea how far away Mississippi is and thought she could get there by walking. When Struthers, our Scottish overseer of the plantations brought her back in chains, we had a quick conversation and decided we had to impose a severe punishment. We also considered that, at that time, we would rather not loose a valuable asset and that we would not permanently damage her and would then sell her off the island. So just after noon we took the wretch to the stables, stuck a gag in her mouth and had her hung from her wrists by chains suspended from the stable door lintel in the full glare of the sun. Her feet were about a foot off the ground. Struthers then stripped off all her rags and began to apply a sound whipping from the shade inside the stables. As for myself I positioned myself on a bench about 6 feet away, in a nice patch of shade, having equipped myself with a carriage whip. As the mood took me I administered the odd flick of the tip of the whip to the choicer parts of the strumpet's body. One of the female house slaves attended on me with a pitcher of iced lemonade and every so often I took a sip.

 Struthers is quite an expert with the whip, he gets adequate practice I suppose. As is his normal practice he started with the slave's back. You know the pattern of tartan. Well we call it Struthers Tartan when you view a slave's back after a dozen or so lashes delivered by this practitioner. He can either draw blood with every stroke or, as in this case, leave the most impressive and vivid weals on the skin of his subject. Every individual blow is measured and the effect of the lash as it lands precisely on its target every single time is exquisite. To watch as each impact is accompanied by the most delicious jerking and twitching of the females body is delightful. I have to tell you it was also mightily arousing. After five minutes of this with only about 4 dozen lashes delivered, all to her back and buttocks, the runaway passed out. 

I invited Struthers to come over out of the sun to share a glass of lemonade with me. While we were discussing how to proceed the most irregular thing happened. We had just agreed to get a stable slave to throw a bucket of water over her to revive the runaway, so that we could resume the punishment, when the house slave spoke up. Can you believe it, being interrupted by a slave! Struthers drew his hand back but, before he could land it, I drew him a look which stopped him. I wanted to see how far this female would go. She said,
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Master please don't whip her any more. She's learned her lesson. She'll be a good girl and won't run away again. No more please master.�&nbsp; 

Naturally I made no reply, wholly ignored her and, turning to Struthers, said, 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I had always suspected it was so Struthers. They do not understand. We will make sure she can never run away again but it is necessary for the other slaves to see what happens to everyone who does. The purpose of her punishment is not to ensure she will never try to run away again but that no one else will try to run away for a first time. Now, however, we have another matter of discipline to address. This creature�, 
 I pointed towards the errant house slave,
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�'How dare it interrupt our conversation. By what right does it presume to talk unbidden to it's betters? I am most displeased. What do you propose Mr Struthers?�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Well Sir the lintel will as easily carry the weight of two as one and we can get another whip and a strong right arm. I suggest we hang her beside this other bitch and strip the skin off the two of them,� said Struthers. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Yes, yes,� I mused, then, turning to the house slave.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; �You have one chance to reduce your punishment. What do you have to say for yourself?� She thought for a few seconds then she dropped to her knees and said, 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Master I apologise most sincerely. The runaway is my sister and to see the agony which she was suffering deranged my mind. You own me and all I can do is to promise you that I shall suck you and fuck you with a skill and fervour that you will not find anywhere else. I beg you to not to be severe with me and to show mercy.� I should add that I have availed myself of her services previously and she knew that I do enjoy a good fuck.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Wait there.� I ordered and turned to Struthers. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Walk a bit with me Mr Struthers while we discuss this.� I said to him. As we walked we discussed the situation. 

Now you should know that I have no regard for these blacks (not Michael's word) and view them as wholly duplicitous. Their word is never to be relied on and at every turn they shirk their duties. What can be achieved by 6 Englishmen requires at least 11 blacks. Apparently 10 to do the work and the eleventh to sound the beat. We do not use that system here and the eleventh sounding the beat does so with a whip. However, I digress. 

You should know that Struthers and I get along very well and in a great many things we share a common viewpoint. We quickly hatched a plan which we felt would give us both significant pleasure and provide a salutary lesson for the other slaves. We agreed that the lesson which could be taught was worth two female slaves and that their fate was now determined.&nbsp; We returned to the house slave. She was shaking with fear while still kneeling on the ground. Her sister had partially revived and was moaning through her gag while still hanging limply by her arms. 

Addressing the kneeling slave I said,
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�We have discussed this case and consider that as well as myself you have slighted Mr Struthers. What you propose does nothing to mitigate the insult he suffered when you interrupted our conversation. You know he has our full authority to impose whatever punishments he considers appropriate. What reason would he have to show you any mercy?&nbsp; Are you also begging for mercy for your sister? Her punishment is hardly begun. Speak slave.�
 Her reply absolutely sealed her ultimate fate.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Master I will gladly minister to Mr Struthers also if that will ease my sister's pain�, she said eagerly.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Let us see how skilled you are then�, I replied. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�While you pleasure me Mr Struthers will interview your sister and explore what contributions she can make towards a commutation of her punishment.�
 What an afternoon we had brother. The girl was stripped naked and began by reverently removing my cock from my breeches. She then kissed the tip and licked my balls while she gently stroked me. My organ responded quickly to this treatment and soon I was aroused and ordered her to take me into her mouth. Her previous practice had been to hold my erect cock near the root and while she took the first four inches into her mouth she would lick and nuzzle my member. This time she knew that would not suffice and she slowly took my whole length into her throat. She then began nodding and the feeling was as if I was fucking her throat. I suppose I was. It is an exquisite feeling. She tried to pull out further than I desired so I grabbed her head and pulled her onto my erect cock. She started to choke and, as I ejaculated down her throat, she lost consciousness. So I withdrew from her gullet, checked she was still breathing and turned my attention to Struthers.

 He had tied ropes round the ankles of the runaway and had pulled her legs impossibly wide apart. He had then lowered her, still suspended by her wrists, till her cunt was only a convenient three feet or so above ground level. She had recovered consciousness and was now fully aware of what was going on. The way Struthers had arranged her both her orifices were available for use. It is our usual practice when we fuck slaves in the colonies not to come in their cunts. We do not want too many half cast bastards. We either come in the whore's mouth, severe punishments are issued for spilling a single drop of master's seed, or bugger her and come in their arsehole at the end. Struthers knew in this case that pregnancy would not be a consideration and he was vigorously fucking the black. With every thrust he drove his penis in to its hilt and sent his pelvis hammering into her vulva. He was demanding to know who had helped her escape and stressed his question by alternately biting her tits chewing them as if they were being worried by a wild animal. He was getting no answers but I suppose that might have been because he had neglected to remove the gag he had forced into her mouth before the whipping began. He saw me watching and grinned as he again and again drove his weapon home. With every blow the bitch shuddered and issued a low moan.
 
My own strumpet was now showing signs of recovery so I returned to where she was retching and belching and said,
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; �What about this memorable fuck then. My weapon is ready and you had better be. If you know what's good for you.� 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Yes master.� she croaked and fairly jumped forward to service my cock.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I am fatigued so you will have to do all the work,� I said reclining languidly in a spot from which she would be unable to see what was happening to her sister. The sight of Struthers pounding the runaway had revived my cock and the house slave immediately straddled me and began to squat down while guiding my cock into her cunt. She lowered herself onto my cock till it was entirely buried into her cunt. I can only describe what happened then by saying that she milked my cock with her cunt. The muscles in her cunt contracted and she gripped me in a most delicious way. Still holding onto my cock with her cunt she raised herself and my cock gradually escaped from her 'grasp'. Before the tip slid out she released the grip with her muscles and quickly plunged down again to rub her labia against my balls. She then repeated this sequence again and again. Her tits bounced up and down in rhythm with her thrusts onto my cock and, after five or six thrusts, I could no longer resist grabbing hold of her nipples and 'assisting' her movement by pulling her down onto my cock all the while rolling her swelling nipples between fingers and thumbs.
 
After about 5 minutes of this she started to squeal and her whole body twitched as she orgasmed. Her pace dropped off and I ordered her, 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Bitch, keep at it till I come and tell you that you can stop.�&nbsp; Well, since I had shot a load of seed less than 10 minutes before, she had to keep up her ministrations for another 20 minutes or so. Before I came, however, she had another orgasm herself and after that she was continuously moaning till I came in her vagina. My penis became flaccid and as I withdrew from her snatch I ordered her to clean me with her mouth. When this had been been achieved to my satisfaction, and every drop of spunk sucked out of my spent weapon, I instructed the doxy to stay where she was and went to see how Mr Struthers was getting on. 

Struthers was sitting drinking some of the iced lemonade. The runaway was still suspended in her unnatural pose and fluid was dropping from her cunt to the ground below. For the first time I called Struthers by his first name.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�William, I see you are taking a well earned rest. What do you think of the impertinence of that bitch in trying to negotiate with us. Have your interrogations borne any fruit?�, I said quietly chuckling and smiling.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�She wasn't very clear but I am sure she tried to tell me something about her sister.� he replied. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�That is good enough for me.� I said. �It confirms my determination that we must make an example of these two. I assume you agree?�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Certainly Mr Fletcher� he replied. �Perhaps at tonight's soiree?�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�A good idea but I have to oversee the household arrangements. I assume I can rely on you to fix up something special, and memorable, for these two? Also from now when there are no slaves around I would be happy if you would call me Michael. I feel we are almost as brothers set amongst these beasts. You know that my lineage is certainly not superior to your own and I would be honoured to be as your brother.�, I replied.
This resulted in the only occasion when I have ever seen Struthers taken aback. It took him about ten seconds to compose himself. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�The honour is mine, Michael� was his short and heartfelt reply as we shook hands.

This may be a suitable point to ask the family to agree to a change of status for William Struthers. At this time he is a salaried employee. He has, assisted only by slaves, seen the new plantation designed, stocked and in all ways brought to the stage outlined in the main business report. He has never once asked for any more than his salary but has rendered exceptional service. I would like the family to consider making him a junior partner in the new plantation. I would propose that we pay his salary, as agreed, up till the plantation is in full production and thereafter offer him 10% of the net profits. The charges for Shaw facilities which the plantation will employ to be at cost, as they are charged to all our other plantations in our accounts. Should he thereafter be instrumental in our adding other enterprises to the Shaw holdings then he would be a junior partner in these also on the same terms. I do not expect an immediate response to this since it is a radical departure from our normal business practices but I must admit that I could not, personally, have seen to such a rapid bringing of our current expansion plans to fruition. Be assured that this matter has not been mentioned to Mr Struthers and a negative reply will only require that I say nothing to him. Should that be your answer I shall, on my own authority, appoint him as controlling manager of the new plantation and award him an increase in salary. This would probably delight him but I am convinced that, as a junior partner in the family's Indies operations, we would see an expansion in our interests which would eventually benefit us all very substantially. If our new plantation were to be equally as profitable as the four we already have our annual net profits from it would be of the order of �60-�70,000 per annum. For a salaried controlling manager I would expect to pay around �2,000 a year (Struthers currently gets �1,750 a year.) so on salary there would be about �63,000 a year to share giving us each �12,600 per annum. As a junior partner Struthers would get �6-�7,000 a year and I would then expect always to achieve the higher of the potential profits still giving �63,000 a year to share amongst us. We would also have a highly motivated associate to promote our further interests in the region. Obviously I am all for this but would agree that a unanimous decision of all the family would by far be the most satisfactory way forward. Once you have reached a decision please let me know either way. But back to my tale.

I said loudly, so that the both slaves could hear, 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�That bitch over there owes you a prime suck and fuck so while you get your dues I'll see to our runaway here. She may be more forthcoming with me now that you have loosened her up a bit.� With that Struthers strolled over to where I had left the house slave recovering from our session. I helped myself to a glass of lemonade and, in a very short time, heard choking and spluttering coming from behind the stalls. Honestly I was not immediately in any condition to fuck the runaway and I did not want the house slave to hear her sister being whipped again before Struthers had availed himself of her expert attention. I had a thought, however, and walked over to the bitch. I was in front of her and she could see that neither was my cock aroused nor was there a whip in my hands. I think it was a pleading look in her eyes and she tried to mumble something through her gag. I went right up to her, as if to put my right ear to her mouth, and bent forward so that the impression was complete. The expression on her face was exquisite as I violently and all in one movement&nbsp; forced my right hand all the way into her gaping, sloppy cunt till it had swallowed my wrist. She squirmed so deliciously as I formed my hand into a fist inside her and started punching her cervix. I assure you that my cock virtually sprang to attention and was fully engorged before I had delivered many more than a dozen uppercuts (should it be uppercunts?) to her. So sloppy and stretched was her cunt with the treatment it had received that it felt like I was fucking a tunnel so I abandoned that orifice and resolved to bugger the bitch. 

I have found that the most satisfactory buggering of a bitch is ensured when accompanied by random applications of pain. That is guaranteed to produce a contraction of the rear passage. I find that sensation quite exhilarating and devised a most satisfactory way to achieve that. The Struthers Tartan was still prominent all over the&nbsp; whores back and I called for a bucket of turpentine and a stiff paint brush. While these were being fetched I buried my cock up to its balls into her rear passage. She was very dry and my invasion must have been quite painful. She moaned appropriately and her muscles clenched. So tight had Struthers stretched her, however, when he tied her up that she was unable to move even in the slightest. For my part I knew that her present pain was but a shadow of what she was about to experience and would be like the minor shock which is often the precursor of a major earthquake. After a few seconds the brush and turpentine had arrived and I dipped the brush in the turpentine. I drove my prick into her then painted the top of her back with turpentine. Wow!! She seemed to explode. Her movement was so violent that she partially dislocated her left hip. Her clenching was so intense that I felt as if my cock was being squeezed by giant hands. Unfortunately she also passed out.
 
My cock was still fully engorged so I walked round to the stalls to where Struthers was having his cock milked. I pushed the bitch forward and bent her over his body. That brought her tits to within reach of Struthers mouth and he immediately bit into her right pap and held on chewing the soft flesh. For my part I drove my cock all the way into her rear passage and began to bugger her. It took 20 minutes for Struthers and I to achieve our objectives&nbsp; during which time she had come at least three times. Later on Struthers said to me that when she was milking his cock he had thought it was impossible to experience a more pleasurable sensation. He found out that he was in error when it was accompanied by chewing on the bitch's nipple (he admitted he has always had a fetish about chewing off a nipple) and then again when, in addition, the whore was being buggered at the same time it literally blew his mind. 

It was time for me to go to make arrangements for the soiree so I left to Struthers the arrangements for the disposition of the two slaves which would take place at the rear of the big house during the soiree. This in not so insensible as it may seem and serves a purpose for the whole of the plantation owners&nbsp; in the island. They all bring slaves with them and news of a salutary example of the penalty imposed for&nbsp; attempted escape, and for assisting escape, will quickly pass round the island. Also almost all of those who attend the soiree will be males and the very few females who do come will know to stay in the big house if the spectacle is likely to offend them.

Invitations had been sent a month previously to all the big houses and plantations on the island and selected other individuals. All in all we expected between 50 and 60 guests for certain though it was made clear in Jamaica society that any white person who was on the island at the day of our soiree would be most welcome to receive our hospitality. I should say that the generosity of the hospitality which we offer to our guests is legendary in the island and goes a long way to ensuring that whenever we express any commercial interest in a matter no one attempts to hold us to ransom or make an unreasonable profit from us. There are currently two competing factions in the island and we are perceived as neutral and have managed to remain on good terms with both. It would be a serious loss to them if they were to lose the only location where they can meet and make civilised arrangements in a convivial atmosphere to their mutual advantage. I studiously preserve this neutrality and am thankful that our holdings are sufficiently substantial that it is not necessary for us to ally our interests with the one or the other. 

 Soon our guests began to arrive and it became immediately apparent that the news of our runaway had spread throughout the community. The guests were all relieved when I assured them that we had apprehended both the runaway and her conspirator in her escape. I advised them that the two were presently in the custody of Mr Struthers awaiting my final judgement on the punishment for their crimes. That I proposed delivering that to the collected gentlemen immediately after dinner, once the ladies had withdrawn and the gentlemen were enjoying some port and cigars. That my guests would be able to participate, if they wished, in the punishment and that their own slaves would know of the fate of the pair. Their approval was universal. Indeed one of their company, of whose identity I was at that time unaware, approached me. I introduced myself to him and gave him a hearty welcome saying that I was delighted to see him and to make his acquaintance. That I hoped that he would enjoy his evening and that it would not be the only time I would be able to offer him my hospitality. He replied presenting his card and said that he was most gratified to receive so fulsome and patently genuine a welcome especially as he was a citizen of the United States and had presented himself and his daughter without a formal invitation. I assured him that he should think nothing of it and that all persons of such obvious quality as himself and his daughter, were always welcome at Burgh plantation whether to a soiree or not and that if he would honour me with a private visit, at some time convenient to him, I would&nbsp; be most pleased to entertain him. He was most profuse with his expressions of gratitude and assured me that his true intention in approaching me was to complement his host on his sensibilities to the ladies in the arrangements he proposed and no other.

I thanked him for his sentiments and said that unfortunately I had other guests waiting and it would be improper of me to be remiss in my duties to them so I was forced to excused myself but suggested that we might find an opportunity to talk later.&nbsp; It was only later that I was able to examine his card to find out that I was host to Mr. David Holmes. I do not know how aware you may be of personalities in this part of the world but Mr Holmes is the Governor of the State of Mississippi. Without doubt amicable relations and an understanding with him would be very beneficial to us particularly if you should you decide that family interests would be well served by expansion into the United States.

When Mr Struthers came in I inquired if all was prepared and he told me he had readied something special and that he hoped I would not be disappointed. I assured him that my part in the punishment of the runaway and her sister was concluded and that, as host, I could now only be concerned about my guests. I also suggested that he might never get a better chance to explore his dream regarding the nipple. The restrictions and limitations on what I could do did not extend to him. I inquired if he had brought out a farriers mobile forge to the punishment area since that would enable any serious wounds to be cauterised and prevent premature loss of consciousness or death by rapid blood loss. He left and came back five minutes later saying all had been arranged. He also advised me that all the carriage drivers, grooms and servants of my guests had been paraded past the pair and were visibly shocked at their state and the obvious import of the arrangements which surrounded them.

The turnout to this soiree was exceptional with almost eighty visitors. 72 males, 4 wives and 2 daughters. We had catered for up to 100 so our arrangements were perfectly adequate. I avoided any lengthy speeches or toasts and busied myself by making sure that all went well. I need not have worried since the household staff carried everything off admirably. The food was plain but superbly prepared, cooked and impeccably served in courses as in the modern French style. Dinner was over in just under two hours and the ladies retired to the music room where I had arranged for a string quartet to entertain them. The gentlemen then relaxed with port and cigars in the library. Some of my neighbours had brought their very young sons with them and I quietly approached each of them and explained that they might not wish their young offspring's immature sensibilities shocked with what was about to be discussed. This gave them an opportunity to send their sons to the music room with the ladies or, as I suggested to them, to the billiards room where they could amuse themselves and I would ensure they were well catered for with soft drinks etc. I have to admit I was pleased when all the adults agreed to my suggestion&nbsp; so when I moved to the business of the evening only adults were in attendance. 

I won't try to say all that I said to the assembled group as the style here is excessively verbose but the gist was that we had had an instance of a slave running away. I advised them that she had been caught that morning, brought back to the plantation and that in our interrogation we had discovered that her escape had been assisted by another of our slaves. I explained that while I might be able to see a single runaway, who ran on the spur of the moment, return to the slave population if suitably chastised I cannot see how I could possibly&nbsp; allow the&nbsp; perpetrators of a conspiracy, and a planned runaway, to return and contaminate the minds of the other slaves. So, with a heavy heart, I had to tell my guests that both slaves were not to live till the next morning. I invited anyone who would wish to advocate a lesser penalty to do so immediately and assured that I would give full consideration to their representations, should they wish to speak up against this extreme punishment.&nbsp; No one voiced any opposition. Indeed there was a murmur of general agreement round the room.
 
I pointedly allowed a short pause in case anyone wished to comment before I continued. I then advised that the next half hour I would be allowing the slaves an opportunity to make their peace with their makers and, during that time, I would understand if any of my guests would wish to leave and take their families home. You will all remain my honoured guests and no one will be lowered one jot in my esteem should they choose to avail themselves of this opportunity to leave. In the meantime let us all have our normal after dinner discussions. With that I started to wander round the room talking to my guests.

 This is when I had an opportunity to talk to Governor Holmes. I said to him that I hoped that he did not feel insulted at my treating him like any other guest and that I had only become aware of his illustrious position when I had the leisure to read his card. I asked that he convey my apologies also to his daughter. For his part he said that so generous was my hospitality that he could not conceive of any deficiency whatever in my treatment of his daughter and himself. He confided to me that the purpose of his visit was to see how the Jamaica plantations were run and that had been quite disappointed in the plantations which he had so far visited. He believed their management was little short of pathetic. I inquired as to where he was staying and, when he told me that he was resident in a Kingston hotel, I immediately offered to entertain himself and his daughter&nbsp; for the remainder of his visit. I promised to show him personally round all the 'Shaw' holdings and that these included a plantation which we were bringing into production from virgin ground and would be fully productive in less than 1 year. He replied that this was more than anyone could reasonably ask of any host, even so convivial a one. I assured him that while one always sought to take advantage of an opportunity to enjoy the company of a person of quality I would not deny that I could see possibilities of benefit to 'Shaw' holdings if, during his visit, he were to come to a view that our commercial practices were of superior merit. So, in truth, my motives were commercial as well as&nbsp; those of a host. This caused him to laugh heartily and he said, 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Young man it is refreshing to talk with you. You are sensible to others, obviously well respected in you community and forthright even with someone you do not know. It will be my great pleasure to accept you kind offer of hospitality. When can it be arranged?� I undertook that I would send a carriage to Kingston on the following afternoon, once the heat of the sun had worn off, and that he and his daughter would be my guests for so long as he desired. We shook hands on it and then I passed on to our other guests who wished words about business matters such as delivering their sugar to our crushing mills, dock arrangements etc.

The allotted half hour having passed the assembled body then adjourned to the rear of the house where the two errant slaves awaited their fates. Struthers had had a triangular, Tyburn style, gallows built with uprights of almost ten feet but, in addition, there was a lower&nbsp; second triangle which was open at the side not occupied by one of the condemned. This second was similar to a hitching rail and was set with its sides parallel to two of the main sides of the gallows. He had had the whores tidied up with their bodies cleaned, inside and out I am told, and the runaway's displaced hip reset. Both had a sort of metal rod or calliper attached to the outside of each leg from hip to ankle so that they were unable to bend their knees. Ropes were attached to the bottom of these rods and then passed through large staples hammered into the main uprights at about three feet above the ground. The slaves themselves were hanging suspended by ropes tied to their wrists from the cross beams of the gallows. Tables were set up about 20 feet away behind both occupied sides of the gallows with at one side cold meats, rum, whiskey etc. and on the other such a collection of whips, needles, and sticks as I had never before seen collected in one place. Beside this was set the farriers mobile furnace with irons already in it and a pleasant glow from the burning charcoal. There were also some buckets of water readily available. I caught Struthers eye and nodded my approval.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Gentlemen�, I said. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Before us are the two slaves of whose fate I advised you less than an hour ago. It is now 8 p.m.. At 10 p.m. They shall be hung by their necks until all life has left their bodies. Until that time they are at your disposal. I only require that you consider the desires of your fellow guests and do nothing which will prevent their being able to keep their 10 p.m. appointment. Mr. Struthers perhaps you would like to begin the proceedings.�

&nbsp; I must say the faces of the two slaves were totally different when I pronounced their fates. As I expected the runaway appeared shocked, terrified and her eyes were pleading for mercy and she emitted a wail which was animal in origin.(Her gag of the earlier proceedings having been removed) The house slave, however, did not change her demeanour, which was in itself strange. She seemed to be wholly distracted and was muttering to herself and her lower body was gyrating in a most distracting fashion. 

Mr Struthers then stepped forward and quickly explained the purpose of the various structures and pointed out the implements readily available adding that should anyone require anything else we would surely be able to secure it for them in a few minutes. His description of the possibilities readily available was met with spontaneous applause but I shall describe them as each was realised.

As an example Struthers then picked out a single tailed whip and without any warning laid a cut across the breasts of the house slave. Now, to say that that got her attention, would only go part way to describing what happened. Struthers drew blood from both breasts which, when the lash arrived, seemed to recoil from the impact. As they recovered to their original shape and the whip fell away a line of blood seeped out from both. She screamed, her whole body convulsed and writhed and her nipples shot out from her breasts. Then Struthers drew back his arm to deliver a second strike. This time he landed his lash across her belly just above the bitch's cunt. Her mouth opened wide but no sound came out and her back arched like a bow. Her legs, although bound to the callipers, were twitching in this contorted position and, I swear, the bitch had an orgasm. Struthers then ordered&nbsp; slaves to
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Open her up� and they pulled on the ropes which passed through the staples at the same time lowering those tied to her wrists. His erection was spectacular and he fucked the bitch with purpose and determination. She moaned all during this and Struthers ordered one of the grooms, who was patently harbouring an enormous erection in his breeches, to
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Fuck her arse or join her on the gallows.�
 When the groom entered her back passage, and I have to say he was hung like a horse, the whore again climaxed. At that Struthers started to chew on her left pap and when he came he bit down so hard that he ripped the flesh off her breast. The accompanied body were, for an instant only, hushed then once again broke into spontaneous applause. This was renewed when Struthers strolled over to the farriers forge removed an iron and sealed the wound on the slave's breast. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�She wasn't going to need it to suckle any whelps anyway.� he said which brought laughter from most of the younger men.

 All this time the groom had been pounding her rear passage but when Struthers burned her tit she had contracted her muscles so that&nbsp; he was forced to exclaim, 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Massa I'm going to come I can't keep it back any more.�
 I immediately ordered that he should withdraw at once and not spoil the rear passage for gentlemen of substance. The wretch withdrew immediately but was obviously in some distress. Struthers raised his eyebrows to me which I knew meant he had had an idea so I nodded my approval and&nbsp; he ordered the ropes which suspended the house slaves arms to be thrown over the hitching rails and had one pulled forwards tightly and anchored to a tent peg. This stretched her body forward so that her breasts were just over the crossbeams.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Finish him off with a handful of this as lubricant.� he said to the whore. Her attention once again, most disconcertingly, seemed to have wandered. However when the grooms enormous erection was presented before her she began to work his member with the substance in her unsecured hand. In only seconds the groom was in agony and no amount of ordering or threatening could persuade him to stay and allow the condemned woman to continue her ministrations. I suppose is may have been a bit unreasonable to expect him to be able to withstand having horse liniment rubbed into his erect penis. The sight of him running around hither and thither like a headless chicken and with an enormous throbbing erect cock, obviously uncertain as to whether he was more terrified at what punishment he might receive by disobeying an order or the agony of having horse liniment rubbed into his engorged penis, did lighten the proceedings. At this I heard a female 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Oh my� and a quiet titter from the direction of the house. It seemed I was the only one who heard it, perhaps because I was slightly detached from the throng, which was naturally pressing towards the entertainment. I immediately made it my business to discover the source. Fortunately the proceedings were starting truly to get going and the attention of my guests was fully focussed on the torment of the slaves. This was proceeding apace but in a wholly predictable and unremarkable fashion. My guests were enjoying themselves and were fully engaged in an orgy of fucking, buggering, whipping and branding the unfortunate pair but were singularly devoid of any originality in their abuses.

 I had only walked about 20 yards when I encountered&nbsp; Governor Holmes and his daughter. Obviously my surprised at seeing them must have been disclosed on my face. Governor Holmes immediately said that he hoped that by bringing along his daughter he had not offended me. Having recovered my composure I was able to immediately assure him that he had not done so in the least. That my surprise was only because it was not the current common practice in Jamaica for ladies of good breeding to view such spectacles but that I could assured him that it was also not unheard of. To the contrary I must apologise to him as a host for neglecting to extend my invitation to the ladies. I immediately had two rocking chairs brought up and had them set beside the cold meats table and invited the Governor and his daughter to occupy them. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�How delicious papa� said Miss Holmes most demurely �Do let us accept Mr Fletcher's invitation.� Governor Holmes indicated his approval and the pair made their way round to their seats. For an hour and a bit the two wretches were, whipped, branded, fucked and buggered non stop by all the assembled group. This with the exceptions of myself, Governor Holmes and a very few of the more senior guests (their grown up sons more than made up for their fathers abstinence by seeking to prove their virility before Miss Holmes). For my own part I watched Miss Holmes more closely than perhaps I should. I can confidently assure you that, although she would make appropriate ladylike noises and feign to divert her gaze, from some of the more severe abuses that were perpetrated on the pair by our more fiendish guests, she never took her eyes from the spectacle and to the contrary delighted in the tortures which were applied. At 20 minutes to 10 the pace of the assault by my guests receded and I observed Miss Holmes say something to her father following which he caught my eye. 

I immediately walked over to him and inquired into how I might attend him. He asked very quietly if it might be acceptable for his daughter to participate in the chastisement of the pair before their execution. While I must admit this request surprised me I managed to give an immediate affirmative reply. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Which doxy do you wish to have made available?� I inquired of Miss Holmes and she indicated the runaway.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Do you require any implements?� I asked.
 Most demurely she replied,
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Well, some strong silk, a hammer and half a dozen or so 6 inch nails together with some skewers, a cheese wire &#8211;&nbsp; oh and if you could have the forge moved closer to her it would be most helpful. Yes that will be all.&nbsp; Should I begin while we are waiting?� 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Mr Struthers� I called turning to him with an expression that clearly showed how deep my surprise was,
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�can you arrange for these items.� In a matter of seconds all the requested paraphernalia had been provided. 

Miss Holmes had not been idle, however. She had ensured that her chosen victim was fully stretched with her legs horizontal. This had caused severe pain to the slave who, as you will recall, had suffered a dislocated hip earlier that day. The runaway had been stretched forward, over Struthers hitching rails, but her arms were pulled out to the sides and had been tied to the uprights of the hitching rails. Little did I realise it but we were about to be given a lesson in the application of pain by a master &#8211; sorry mistress. As a prelude, while her implements were being collected, she amused herself by landing a few wicked slashes with a riding crop on her victims labia. The slave writhed and bucked too much for Kitty's pleasure (I have since&nbsp; found out that Miss Holmes's given name is Catherine) and, as soon as the hammer and nails were presented to her she took them and moved to the slave's head. She looked towards me and asked if she could have the slave pushed forward by about 9 inches. I told her to issue whatever instructions she liked and it would be done as if ordered by me. She acknowledged this most demurely and then, in the most commanding voice I have ever heard emitted from a female body, she ordered two of the slaves in attendance to 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Push this bitch forward till her tits are hanging over on my side of this rail.� The slaves positively jumped to do her bidding. She pulled the beaten and mauled sacks of flesh that had been the runaways breasts down towards the ground. Then, so much as was possible while avoiding landing a blow on her own thumb (she insisted on conducting every part personally), looking the slave straight in her eyes she drove the first nail through the breast meat and into the beam. This hushed the spectators and when Kitty repeated the treatment through the other breast a complete silence, broken only by the moans of the slaves descended. Next she drove nails through both of the slave's outstretched hands so securing them to the hitching rail's crossbeam. She then returned to continue her beating between the slave's legs. The movement, while being equally spontaneous, was much reduced in magnitude. 

After only a dozen lashes Miss Kitty laid down her whip and picked up the strong silk thread. She moved to between the slave's legs and began to tickle just above where she had been whipping. After a few seconds a nub of flesh&nbsp; began to form and gradually grew in size till it was almost the same size as the slaves nipples. Kitty then deftly wound five loops of the silk round the base of the nub making very sure each was very tight and tied the silk off. She then moved back to the slave's head and repeated this treatment to each of the unfortunate's nipples. A droplet of blood trickled onto her hand while she was doing this but she ignored that and proceeded with her plan. As it turned out this droplet was just the first of many. She then instructed that ten skewers be brought to her and began to distribute them round the runaway's body. She had obviously been making too much noise for Kitty and the first skewer went vertically through her tongue and the second horizontally from one cheek through and out the other. The third was pushed through her nose and with that Kitty moved on. Each breast saw two skewers driven through, I was amazed at the elasticity of female tit skin which is truly quite remarkable, in a cross pattern. She then returned to between the slave's legs and pushed a skewer through each of her labia lips, which were very swollen as a&nbsp; result of the whipping to which Kitty had already subjected them and the tenth through her tied off clitoris. Kitty was far from finished, however, and she next had the top rail to which the runaway was nailed detached from its uprights and the ropes tied to the slave's wrists passed back over the top of the gallows and pulled till they were taught. Surprisingly, to most of us, she then ordered the ropes stretching the slave's legs to be relaxed. We only realised how wicked this was when we saw that a great part of the slave's weight was now borne by the nails&nbsp; driven through her tits. Very gradually they began to tear through the slave's flesh. Surely only the skewers through her tongue and cheeks reduced the volume of her screams. With only a few minutes left till the appointed time for the execution Kitty picked up her cheese-wire and first severed each of her victims nipples. The wretch's tied off and skewered clitoris was swollen and a very intense colour. Miss Kitty smacked it with the tip of a horse whip, ran her finger nails across the tender flesh and scratched it viciously before she amputated it with her cheese wire. Similar treatment followed for&nbsp; the labia lips which were severed above the skewers. She then pulled a red hot iron from the farrier's furnace and seared each of the exposed wounds. We all thought she had gone so far as was possible but we were wrong. For she then ordered the slaves to fully release the ropes which secured the slave's legs to the uprights and for a slave to hang on each of the tormented bitch's legs. Soon the poor woman's tits gave up their unequal struggle to support this additional weight and they were each torn in two by the nails Kitty had driven through them. A steady stream of dark blood welled from the torn flesh till Kitty put her red hot iron to the wounds. The poor wench now seemed to have four projections from her chest where previously she had had two. Only the skewers which Kitty had driven through the tortured tit flesh held them together at their bases. I do not think it surprising that the assembled throng, which at first had enthusiastically encouraged this virago, progressively had become more and more silent with each of her tortures and a complete hush had descended.

The time was approaching 10 p.m.. A single rope with a noose worked onto the end was now thrown over each of the two occupied arms of the gallows. The condemned slaves were lowered to the ground and the nooses tightened round their necks. As 10 p.m. struck they were hoisted so their feet were clear of the ground. They struggled, choked released the contents of both their bladders and bowels but progressively their movements diminished. No doubt severely weakened by Kitty's attentions the runaway expired first but her partner in crime survived some twenty seconds or so more. The evening's diversion was now completed. I had moved over to Mr Struthers and said, quietly, to him that Governor Holmes and Miss Kitty were to be our guests from the morrow and that I wished him to apprehend the groom who had run off and detain him but not, as yet, to administer any punishment. He expressed a comment about Miss Kitty which was so obscene that I cannot repeat it!

We all now retired to the main house and left the execution scene. Miss Kitty was quite flushed and speckled with blood. Governor Holmes, on seeing this as we neared the lights of the house took his leave and I assured him that my carriage would attend him, as we had arranged, on the morrow. So ended the most exceptional day which I have ever spent. 

This letter has become much larger than I had ever intended but I will write again, soon, to tell you of any developments in forging a relationship with Governor Holmes. Also of the visit which I will shortly be taking to the United States. The outcome of these could be exceptionally beneficial to our family interests but I want to consider exactly what I would recommend and make a well considered argument on its behalf. The investment required would be very substantial but the potential staggering. I look forward to your reply as soon as possible and send you, and our cousins, all my very best wishes.

Your Brother, Michael. 

Sir Geoffrey spoke first.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Well Steven that is quite a letter. Lets deal with the business first. The matter of Struthers mentioned by Michael. My immediate thoughts are that we have already too many, diverse interests in Jamaica to expect one family member to be able to able to effectively and properly control them, far less expand them. I presume no one here wants to go to the Indies? Michael has done exceptionally well for us but might well have reached the limit of what one man, on his own can do. I am therefore in favour of his suggestion with the proviso that should Michael, or our group, as gathered here today, decide that the arrangement should be terminated then we can do so with one year's notice to Struthers. Steven, what do you think.� 

Steven, as was his normal fashion took a short time to consider exactly what to say. He adopted the Harold Wilson manoeuvre and slowly lit his pipe.(His preference over a cigar.)
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�You all know I often put an alternative argument forward to that of Geoffrey. I do this when I feel there is a potentially sound alternative so that both can be properly explored. In this case, however, I believe that he has exactly grasped the essence of the matter. I had not considered the termination of any agreement with Struthers but believe Geoffrey's suggestion to be admirable. We have all noted that Michael would hope that we could reach a unanimous decision so cousins what do you say?'

As the second in age James spoke next, 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I am in full agreement with Geoffrey's proposal what about you George?�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Wholly in agreement.� said George. 

Steven then said,
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I shall accordingly draw up a business letter to Michael telling him that we send our heartiest greetings and grateful thanks for the exemplary manner in which he has controlled the family affairs and that we are more than satisfied with the progress of the family interests in Jamaica. That his suggestion regarding William Struthers was given full consideration at our meeting and, with the one proviso below, which we trust will meet with his own agreement, we all, individually and collectively, agree to the following:-
Michael has the full approval of all the family to offer to Mr Struthers a junior partnership in the plantation about to come into full production, as well as in any other Shaw family interests in the region which he is instrumental in bringing into use. He will receive 10% of the net profits of all such interests (the computation of the net profit of these interests to be made in the same fashion as all our other endeavours) and, till the current plantation in development is brought into full production, will be paid at a rate not less than his present remuneration. The exact sum to be determined by Michael. This arrangement will continue till either the meeting of the family determines it should come to an end or Michael does. In either case Mr Struthers will be given at least 12 months notice. Does this wording meet with approval?� Three nods of agreement and the brothers began to discuss the other part of Michael's letter.

To be continued.









The Family Shaw &#8211; Part 2

It was Steven who began their talk about the treatments meted out to the two slaves. His comments surprised his cousins, not by the reaction he had to the tale but by his assessment of the situation. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�You know,� he said, �that in fact Michael has taken a bigger risk by chastising and killing these two unfortunates than we would if we were to undertake a similar adventure.�
Knowing that Steven would not, lightly, make such a statement the brothers pressed him to explain why. Steven's reasoning was along the following lines. Michael had taken the law into his own hands. It was not lawful at that time to execute a slave without process of law, although in practice if a slave died during lawful chastisement that was unfortunate but certainly not criminal. 
James interrupted and asked, 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�So if Michael had continued to torment the creatures till they expired and not declared that they were to die at 10 p.m. he would have been on better legal ground?�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Certainly� replied Steven. �In that case he would have been totally within his rights.�
Steven then continued to explain that they need, in reality, have no concerns however for Michael's position. Steven knew that the local magistrates and persons of authority invariably attended the Shaw soiree and that, by giving the assembled body an opportunity to advocate a lesser punishment, Michael could argue that all those who failed to take up that opportunity were complicit. 

Steven said,
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�In the situation, as it is in Burgh we,� by which he meant the four of them present, �control all the necessary arms of authority to ensure we could pursue any horror or outrage which took our fancy. We should do so in privacy but, the powers which we can&nbsp; lawfully exercise are greater than any of you seemed to appreciate. Geoffrey, naturally is the local magistrate. Also, in a very forward thinking move, I have been appointed as legal advisor to the court. The coroner is, of course, James, and I again am clerk to the coroner's court,&nbsp; so we can properly issue any death certificates that might be required and George can dispose of the bodies. I am Town Clerk and so there would be no difficulties from that quarter and the local facilities would all be available to them. We lack a 'Struthers' but that could be easily remedied and, should it be required, I believe I may know where to find one. '

(It has, perhaps, been remiss of me not to have previously outlined the various peccadilloes which the four practised.
Sir Geoffrey &#8211; It was known that no female defendant between the ages of 20 and 50 had been convicted of any offence in his court over the previous several years. He had an interesting practice of adjourning after the prosecution had set out its case and then proceeding to interview the accused, in private, before resuming his deliberations. He would then determine that either he found certain evidence to be unreliable or that the matter came down to the accusers word against that of the poor unfortunate in the dock and that he wished to again adjourn while he consulted with his legal adviser before delivering a verdict. Surprisingly this invariably required a further, private, interview with the cousins thoroughly reviewing the case for and against the accused. The verdict would then be that&nbsp; he found the matter not to be proven, to his satisfaction, and that being the case following the advice he had been given by his legal advisor the accused was not guilty and would be discharged. This often required a private sermon on to be delivered on ensuring that she did not find herself before his court again &#8211; private arrangements to obtain the Court's advice could, however, be made.

James &#8211; James employed various unusual medical methods, for the time. Conventional medicine involved blood letting as the treatment of choice for almost every ailment. Leeches and scarifiers were the prescriptions that the most modern doctors maintained were beneficial. James disagreed and he more often would use herbs, poultices and powders in his treatments. Only when he was treating a person who liked to effect upper class pretensions did he use the scarifier on them. He would say that these buggers deserved every bit of the pain he could inflict upon them. As to his peccadillo, he enjoyed fondling the female body. It was often commented&nbsp; that he examined the wives and daughters of the sick more than the sick themselves. He would explain this by arguing that once a person exhibited the symptoms of an ailment he would do his utmost to treat it. Many illnesses seemed to be passed, however, from person to person in a family and all that he was doing was to make absolutely certain that the illnesses of a husband or father were not being passed on to the wife or daughter who nursed them. He was being thorough and he could not be held responsible if other doctors were less concerned about the continuing health of the relatives of the sick. He never tried this line on with his brothers, however, who all knew he just enjoyed groping females. It was surprising, however, how many of the wives of previous patients volunteered to continue with his preventative examination regime.

George &#8211; George was acknowledged as having the largest collection in the county, if not the whole region, of drawings, etchings, carvings and books of a pornographic nature. He would hire 'models' to engage in artistic poses of the scenes portrayed in these 'classical' works and, indeed, was known often to have participated with the models, but only to the extent required to complete the tableaux. The models would be well paid for their services and he seldom had any difficulties in recruiting volunteers from the local wenches. 

Steven &#8211; Steven participated fully with Geoffrey in their court escapades and in addition he always conducted a pre court screening of cases before they arrived at the magistrate's court. If&nbsp; appropriately persuaded of the merits of a case he often would effectively present it on a female plaintiff's behalf. This would ensure that Geoffrey would hear those arguments which would guarantee a successful result. Geoffrey naturally co-operated, regardless of the merits, and Steven, in addition to his legal fee, would have received a more personal pre court 'retainer' from a satisfied client. )

Steven continued to explain that,
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�In the present uncertain times, following the Cato Street conspiracy, parliament has seen fit to provide all the tools for which any group of persons of power could ask to do whatever they wished, to whomsoever they wished.�
He continued by advising the assembled company that, merely as an abstract exercise, if they desired to abduct any female, abuse her and then dispose of the remains of the victim they need only proceed as he set out.


Geoffrey, as Magistrate, would issue a search warrant under the Seizure of Arms Act of 1819.
Geoffrey and Steven would carry out the search of the specified premises and surprise of surprises find (even if they had to take it with them) a prohibited weapon.
All inhabitants would be immediately arrested and taken into custody in the Town Hall cells.
Any female, of which they desired the use, could then be seized by and held incommunicado by the family.
With the suspension of Habeas Corpus no person could require production of the wretch.
Once the wretch had served her purpose the coroner would be asked to consider the death of an unknown person.
The coroner, sitting in camera, would determine an accidental death, apparently through being run down by a carriage, or some other horrific accident and issue a death certificate.
The local cleric would arrange for a Christian burial.


Steven considered that all of this was either within the law, as it then stood, or was an action which no others could challenge.

While the others mused over this thought George started to opine on the nature of the male of the species and his sexual pleasure. He believed that there were six distinct levels and he went on to put his thoughts forward for the consideration of his relatives.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;George's levels of sexual enjoyment -


Mundane copulation. According to George this was when the male and female both desired the act and participated willingly. He was of the opinion that the pleasure from this was likely to be transitory only and that the male would, if he had any refined sensibilities, soon tire of it. 
Cowed subdued compliance. Here the male dominated the female by force and was able to take whatever sexual pleasures he desired. This was a much more satisfactory arrangement for the male and he could sustain his interest for a greater period.
Stimulated compliance through application of incentive. Here the male moves the female to an improved level of performance, through the inflicting of various levels of pain. He would also be able to require her to perform acts which she found distasteful and otherwise might have tried to resist.
Enhanced climax through asphyxiation or mutilation of the female at the moment of orgasm.
Non penetrative sexual fulfilment achieved through systematic torture and/or mutilation of the female body.
Vicarious satisfaction through the observance of others enjoying any of the above


George was of the opinion that Michael's description of Miss Kitty as a virago was appropriate and that she had displayed level 5. Struthers was at level 4 while Michael had taken matters to level 3. In George's opinion those at level 6 were to be pitied but that levels 1 to 4 were to be seen as a progressive natural development.&nbsp; Not everyone could truly achieve level 5 could and that might, possibly only be reached by the more sensitive or discerning.

Since it was now very late they adjourned but arranged to meet only one week later. Officially to further consider the business of the new weaving factory but also to allow for more time for other matters.

One week later the four had another meeting. After another hearty meal at Burgh Manor, from which Lady Shaw was again absent at her parents, Sir Geoffrey opened the after dinner meeting by inviting anyone who had business matters to raise them.
 
James spoke up and made a couple of suggestions. He proposed that they should look into the possibility of converting the soon to be surplus weaving halls into a workhouse, a hospital and a lunatic asylum. (the workhouses of 1820 were not the oppressive, bleak establishments of Dickensian literature. Such establishments were&nbsp; only constructed after the 1834 Poor Law and were intentionally&nbsp; intended to be severe and not to replicate the much superior conditions in the earlier style. The Dickensian type were so severe since they were meant to be a last resort for poor who absolutely could cope no longer.) These actions would have several potential advantageous results. The workhouse could be used to house indigents from adjoining parishes and might be able to be run at a small profit or at least near cost by charging out its services to these adjoining parishes. This would address Steven's concern at the rising cost of outdoor relief. George might care to supervise its operations. A hospital and asylum would provide facilities which would bring great credit to the parish and he, James, would volunteer to oversee them. Also, should we wish to explore the possibilities introduced by Michael's letter, the availability of untraceable females would be improved as well as a facility for their detention. It would be possible to commit any number of females to the insane asylum without any query. His application to Geoffrey was all that would be required to achieve that for any person. He advised that when this occurred to him the previous&nbsp; night it seemed potentially too good to be true since it would appear to address all the matters raised at their previous&nbsp; meeting. He finished by asking what the reaction of the others was to this as a proposal.

Steven, in his usual considered way, lit his pipe, inhaled some tobacco smoke, savoured the flavour and then responded to this suggestion. He believed that there might be a great deal of merit in James' proposal. He could see where it addressed a large number of current concerns but he wanted to do some costings. That would take at least a week but he would put it at the top of his priority lists.

Geoffrey liked the idea and said he would keep actively in touch with Steven and George indicated he would certainly be interested in running the establishment. 

Steven then made another suggestion. He enquired as to whether or not Sir Geoffrey felt if he was well enough connected to be allowed to raise a troop of fencibles. If so then Steven knew exactly the right individual to be appointed. This was a wholly corruptible former cavalry officer who had left the regular army under a cloud, apparently he had been taking excessive liberties with some Belgian civilian females in the aftermath of Waterloo and the provost Marshall wanted him hung. His family was well connected and got him off but when he heard of it Wellesley swore that if he once clapped eyes on him again he would personally shoot him. The family then disowned him and he had been building up debts ever since. Steven had acquired his notes and believed that they should easily be able to manipulate him into a situation where he would face a death sentence should he ever decline to do what the family required of him. 

James then inquired into whether or not a possible location for the detention and enjoyment of a potential specimen might be able to be available before a year, which he supposed would be the earliest time that his lunatic asylum suggestion could come about. 

George coughed and said that he knew of a spot, which he had on occasion used for his tableaux, and where he was certain that complete isolation could be secured. He knew of&nbsp; a worked out quarry about a quarter of a mile off the road and about 2 miles up the Kirkbride road. This had a vacant caretakers cottage. The quarry has three large caves worked into the hillside and these have had their entrances sealed. George was of opinion that for an expenditure of about �500, which he would happily be prepared to fund, the place could be made totally secure. As a further suggestion he proposed that they form an 'Inventors Club'. That would have the merit that they could secure any goods which they wanted for their 'extra curricular' activities without raising any eyebrows as well as making the quarry the site for their 'Club Activities'. He suggested that a few rockets flying about, explosions and the like would see the word passed round that unsafe materials were being used. A very strict no trespassing policy would then be viewed as reasonable.

Geoffrey then brought a note of caution to the meeting. He said it seemed to him that, without, any agreement to that effect the group was moving to form some sort of&nbsp; extreme, modern Hellfire Club. What he now suggested was that, while Steven would still look into the costs of the conversion of the weaving halls,&nbsp; they should all go away and return in a fortnight having made up their minds about whether or not they were prepared to commit wholeheartedly to this. If they started down this route there would be no turning back and everyone would be committed to the whole course. He cautioned that it would have to be a unanimous decision and that it would be an anonymous poll &#8211; yes or no - on a piece of paper.

Two weeks passed and the next meeting was at James more modest home. A two story, plus attics, 10 room mansion which housed his surgery and waiting rooms as well as his own and his servants quarters. This was the venue since, for once, Lady Shaw was at home. The meal was no less substantial than that enjoyed at Burgh Manor and Sir Geoffrey was most complementary to his brother. After dinner they adjourned to James' library and, since it was formally a family business meeting, Geoffrey was in the chair. James had pens, ink and paper provided for all present and, once the servants had cleared the room, Geoffrey opened the meeting. 
In typical Shaw fashion he immediately asked the four to indicate their intentions with regard to the 'Inventors Club'. He made clear that a yes vote committed the individual to the full participation in the objectives of the club. One no vote, however, and the club would not come into being. He asked that if any of the group felt uncertain about what the objectives were they should ask now before they cast their vote. No one spoke up. Geoffrey took a puff at his cigar, a sip of the port and then said.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Steven, will you do the honours then.�
Steven said,
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Gentlemen, the papers before you require you to indicate yes or no. Each person is asked to indicate their vote, fold their paper over and place it on the tray in front of us. When there are four papers in place I shall open them and declare the count.�

The voting took seconds only since each of the brothers had already made up their minds. Steven had also determined his vote and he half turned in his chair and filled in his ballot folded the paper and turned back. Three votes were already on the tray. He took the tray to himself, opened each vote in turn, then looked up and said,
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Gentlemen, congratulations, we have a unanimous vote.�

Geoffrey then said,
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Excellent. I now call to order the inaugural meeting of the Burgh Inventors Club. I propose that the club be limited in its membership and that new members be only admitted on their proving to the satisfaction of all existing members that they are, in every respect fit for membership. A single negative vote to exclude from membership. I further propose that no one person should be elected as chairperson and that honour should rotate on a monthly basis.�

James seconded these proposals which were carried nem con. 

George volunteered that, in anticipation of this vote, he had already begun the work on the quarry. As he had offered he would personally meet the costs and he invited anyone with time and ideas to visit the site with him and they could agree to vary the work. Geoffrey proposed that a club fund should be opened and that staggered contributions be made, he proposed that he should contribute �2,500, James and George each �1,500 and Steven �500 to create a fund of �6,000. Steven to be treasurer and that he should notify the members annually of the state of the fund and call for additional funds from members, in the same proportions, should funds drop below �1,000.&nbsp; As Steven moved to raise an objection James and George, by their expressions stopped him and he merely deferred to Geoffrey's proposal.
 James suggested that the sequence for chair person should be Geoffrey, Steven, George then himself with Geoffrey to hold office till the end of the next month and that again, was approved without any contrary view expressed. Geoffrey then suggested that they leave the drafting of any further constitutional matters to Steven. 

James, rather sheepishly, then said,
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Gentlemen, I presume that you are all aware of my preference for mature women with large breasts.� At that they all smiled and nodded. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Well�, he continued �I know where it will be possible for me&nbsp; to acquire such a female, in circumstances which I can manipulate to ensure that no suspicion can fall on us and at a time I can adjust, within reasonable parameters' over the next month or two.�&nbsp; George volunteered that the quarry would be ready and free of workmen in at most three weeks and James arranged to visit the site with him in the next few days. 

James then continued,
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�The circumstances are that I am currently treating this woman's husband. He is some 50 years old, worked all his life in the local mines and is terminally ill with much stone dust having settled on his lungs. The poor creature can hardly breath. I am treating him with powdered arsenic which acts as a stimulant and gives him a feeling of having improved. This feeling is false and merely a short term palliative. His wife, Janet, is some ten years his junior and, while I have told her that I cannot promise a recovery, I do not believe she understands&nbsp; how far gone her husband is. Before you ask yes, I can assure you that I regularly ensure she shows absolutely no signs of having contracted the illness and is a particularly health specimen of womanhood. She looks to me to advise her and to ease her concerns. They have no money but I have assured her that she need give no concern to that and that I will assure that they are not evicted from their cottage and that they have adequate fuel and food. I have my kitchen send food every day and they no doubt eat better now than they have ever done. I am sure that I can keep the husband alive for a few weeks more and can make the wife more and more dependent on my advice and support. All I need do to bring about the husbands end is to increase the arsenic dosage in one of the powders which I give to her to administer to her husband. I will then issue a death certificate giving his lung disease as cause of death. She will come to me and I will be of great assistance by arranging for George to bury her husband, offer to continue the food etc. as long as she requires it and to communicate with any relatives if she would like that. I will also offer to try to find her employment in one of our households if she would prefer that. This will overwhelm her senses and it is most unlikely she will be able to think logically. After a few days for her to come round&nbsp; I will take a maid and call round at her home. No matter which she prefers I will be able, at some time, to arrange to be alone with her. I will have made sure that my domestic staff know that I wrote a letter on her behalf to an address in Workington. I am sure Steven can arrange for what will appear to be a reply. I will then take my carriage and, in a final gesture, of generosity carry her off. She may believe that she is going to Geoffrey&#8217;s to go into service but, so far as the village is concerned, she will be going to Workington. In fact when we get to the road to George's quarry one journey for her will be nearly at its end and another into a different life will be about to begin. Think over that as a plan and let me know of any weaknesses you may see in it.� 

Five weeks later the old quarryman died on cue. James carried out his plan and it worked perfectly. The only difference was that the widow had a sister in Silloth and James purported correspondence was with her instead. When Janet decided that she wanted to go there she told James that she would be leaving at dawn on the following day to walk there. James insisted that he could not countenance that especially since it would mean that she would be unable to take any of her belongings with her. He absolutely insisted that he would take her there in his carriage. His force of personality was so great that she reluctantly agreed. The roads in 1820 were not good. Even the old Roman roads which criss crossed this region had seriously deteriorated by this time so when James, 'accidentally' took a wrong&nbsp; turning up the lane to the quarry she was not concerned. He continued saying that he was seeking for a place to turn and when they came to the quarry that became the perfect spot. When James had a key for the padlock that secured the chain round the gate it seemed the most usual thing in the world, the Shaws always had the keys for locks and there was no reason to have expected this to be different. George and Steven had ridden out earlier and their horses were concealed in one of the caves. They were in the cottage. 

James had arranged that what appeared to be a nose bag was hung at the side of his seat. This was larger than the norm however and was, in reality, a hood to pull over his passenger's head. He distracted Janet by pointing towards the hill and saying,
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; �Look, an eagle�. 
Janet looked in the direction in which James was pointing and never saw another sight as a free person. James slipped the nose bag over her head and pinioned her arms. Steven and George rushed out from the cottage and in a matter of seconds the three whisked the shocked woman into their prepared holding cave. George had arranged for six strong boxes to be made, 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Storage for our rockets,� he had explained to the joiners, and Janet was bundled into one. The lid was shut, securely locked, and the box carried through a second set of doors deeper into the cave. The box had several holes drilled in it and Janet was screaming loudly. When her captors left her inside the deeper cave and closed and locked both the inner doors and the outer door, however, there was no sound to be heard. James said to Steven and George,
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Well I cannot be seen at home till tomorrow. The trip to Silloth and back would take too long. I think I'll call at Geoffrey's in-laws then come back tonight for the first, formal, plenary meeting of the Inventors Club. I'm due a visit at Kirkbride Castle to check up on Lord Walter's health. It gets dark about 6 p.m. at this time of year so I assume the meeting will start about then?� When Steven indicated his agreement James said,
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Remember lads, no 'Inventing' till we are all in attendance. See you George, Steven.� and as he drove off in his carriage the two cousins chuckled to themselves and walked over to the cave where they had concealed their horses.

The trip to Kirkbride took another hour and a half but was uneventful. Once at Kirkbride Castle James brushed himself down and tidied his appearance before approaching the front of the Castle. This was an imposing building built in the 17th Century when Castles had become statements of wealth and importance rather than defensive structures. If one examined the building, closely however the signs of decay were clear. Most of the land which had supported the castle by the farming produce had been sold off. The rest was mortgaged, as was the Great House. The Bruys lived in a genteel poverty supported by Sir Geoffrey who effectively paid all the bills. Although the Bruys lived in the West of the country most of their distant relatives lived in Yorkshire where the de Bruys, or Brux names were relatively common in the nobility of the area. Lord Walter's ancestor had been instrumental in the safe passage of Queen Margaret and her young son Edward to Scotland and then had fought with such outstanding bravery at the Battle of Wakefield that he had been knighted on the field. Further singular acts had seen a grateful Tudor King ennoble Walter's ancestor and so the 1st Earl of Kirkbride had been created. What had taken 300 years to accumulate had, however, taken one generation to squander and Lord Walter's grandfather ruined the family. It was only the connection with the Shaw family that meant they could again get credit from local businesses and Sir Geoffrey had his own means of controlling that. James drove up to the front of the house and as a groom came out to take the carriage he went up to the front door and was met by the Butler. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Good morning, Harvey,� he said. The butler was John Harvey but convention required that he be addressed by his surname. �I trust that I have not called at an inopportune time.�
Harvey replied in the normal fashion,
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Good morning Doctor Shaw, I cannot say Sir, but I believe their graces may be at home to you. If you would wait here I shall inquire.�

It took only a few seconds for James to be shown into the sitting room where Lord Walter and Lady Ann were taking morning tea. James had a short chat with each explained that unexpected business required that he journey to Silloth and he could not possible drive past without paying his respects. He then made polite inquiries into the health of both and, without being particularly intrusive, so far as was possible carried out an examination. Their health was not particularly good but James prescribed some antacids for their indigestion, powdered chalk with mint flavouring, and a mild natural laxative. Thankfully neither Lord Walter nor Lady Ann were devotees of blood letting so James was able to adopt his preferred style of medicine. When Lord Walter, with a loud guffaw, said to James,
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�You do know that in the past my ancestors would have seen you burned for witchcraft for your powders and potions.� James knew that he had pleased the old man and that his visit was welcome. He replied by saying,
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Well your grace if you do not see any improvement after a day or two I'll know what to expect then.�

James then inquired after the health of the servants and Lady Ann rang the bell for the butler. She instructed Harvey to have the servants collect in the servant's hall, so that Doctor James could ensure that none had an illness which required treatment, and to return once that had been done.
A few minutes later Harvey returned and James excused himself and accompanied the butler to the servants hall. On the way there he gave a sovereign to the butler advising him that this was from Sir Geoffrey. James asked if Harvey had any messages for Sir Geoffrey as he, James, would be meeting with Sir Geoffrey shortly and would ensure, personally, that they were delivered direct to his hand. Harvey said he would have his report placed in James carriage. James said to Harvey that he had brought a couple of boxes of cigars and a few bottles of wine for the household and no doubt Lord Walter might like a box. The household staff was down to 8, where it had once stood at nearer 60. James had asked Harvey when the staff had last been paid and when this elicited laughter he gave Harvey another sovereign to 'tide them over'. Harvey knew the financial situation of the Bruys, probably better that Lord Walter, and every visit by one of the Shaw brothers was a most welcome sight in the servant's hall. James gave them all a very quick physical, he resisted the temptation to examine more closely one of the house maids and the ladies maid, and pronounced them all in fairly good health. Harvey was given some of James antacid and the cook some extract of willow bark for headaches, from which she had been suffering. One of the maids had a skin rash and James gave her some witch hazel ointment. He was careful to tell them to use the medicines which he had given them exactly as he had directed them. He said that if any of them was unwell he, James, would be most displeased if they failed to get word to him. With that he returned to Lord Walter and Lady Ann. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It was lunch time and Lady Ann insisted that James stay though, she cautioned, they only ate a light meal at midday. Lord Walter was also keen for James to stay since it gave him an excuse to open some wine and tell his family stories. An hour and a half later Lord Walter was drunk and Lady Ann had, 'retired for an afternoon nap'. As a polite guest James was listening to Lord Walter's tales nodding sagely and making approving grunts at the appropriate junctures. Lord Walter had reached his current pet story. 

The Annandale Claim.

While Lord Walter was correctly styled the 14th Earl of Kirkbride by dint of his direct descent from the forebear previously mentioned he had currently a claim before the College of Arms that he should also be entitled to the title and privileges of the 27th&nbsp; Lord of Annandale. Lord Walter had personally researched the ancestry of the 1st Earl of Kirkbride and claimed that he had irrefutable proof that he was the direct descendent of the second son of the 3rd Lord of Annandale who was called William de Brus. The lines of all subsequent heirs of all subsequent holders of the title having died out. The last being the 17th Lord who died in 1536 and whose land was annexed, wrongly, to the crown. Lord Walter's ancestor Henry the 5th Earl of Kirkbride should have inherited and become the 18th Lord of Annandale. By Lord Walters reckoning that made him entitled to claim all lands titles etc. which had been acquired subsequent to the 3rd Lord of Annandale's death. Lord Walter was convinced that there was a deep conspiracy involving King George 1V and his late father King George 111 as well as the College of Arms to deny him the title. His fantasy was that, should this claim be approved, then a new George 1V would not be having his coronation next year but that he would as King Walter 1. Lord Walter maintained that the 6th Lord of Annandale, Robert the Bruce was King of Scotland. The Stuart dynasty owed their claim to the Scottish Crown to their relationship to the Bruce and so with the Union of the Crowns his claim to the crown was irrefutable.

James was too polite to comment but thought to himself that the logic of this would be much improved by a large consumption of alcohol.&nbsp; Since he had an appointment that evening he was drinking only moderately and, after dutifully giving Lord Walter a full opportunity to run out of steam, he said that his business in Silloth called him and that if he broke his journey at Abbey Town he could conclude his business early the next day and return to Burgh by dinner that night. He thanked Lord Walter and Lady Ann, in her absence, for their very kind hospitality and asked them if they had any messages they wished taken to their son-in-law. Lord Walter advised that their daughter called often but that his offer was well received.

The First Plenary Meeting of the Burgh Inventors Club.

James was the first to arrive back at the quarry. The club agreement was that until all members were present, or accounted for, no new 'devices' which had passed 'prototype stage' could be 'tested'
( a 'device' was code for new strumpet, 'prototype stage' was code for captured and 'tested' meant&nbsp; subjected to assault by members.) He waited in the cottage for the others to arrive. Shortly after nightfall the group had assembled. Geoffrey inquired as to how difficult it had been to negotiate the prototype stage and was pleased to hear how simply the matter had been concluded. James advised that he had called at Kirkbride Castle and picked up some messages from the butler. They then agreed that they would not subject their captive to anything more severe than a whipping as they did not want to deprive themselves of future pleasures. Steven was concerned about any possible pregnancies but James assured him by advising that she had borne no children though her husband was reputed to have a bastard. This suggested to him that she might not be fertile and in any case&nbsp; he thought it unlikely that she would survive so long that a pregnancy would be a consideration. 

After a toast to the Club they moved to the true business of the night. The door in the cave marked, Danger Gunpowder &#8211; NO TRESPASSING was opened and the four walked in. There were adequate oil lamps inside once they had passed through the second door. At the noise of that door opening Janet had begun to shout again crying for help. None would be forthcoming.

The box in which she had been imprisoned was opened and she was seized by the four they quickly blindfolded her. Ropes were then tied round each of her wrists and ankles and these were attached to shackles set into the cave walls. The four ropes were then pulled tight and Janet fell silent as she realised that she had fallen into the grasp of devils. 

George spoke,
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Shall we see what we've got then?, he asked.
The four of them then removed every stitch of her clothing and stood back to examine the naked body displayed for their pleasure. While in the box her body heat had been contained and kept her reasonably warm but now naked, in an unheated cave, on the 29th of February in the North of England she was rapidly becoming very, very cold. Some goose bumps began to form on her flesh as the cousins looked her over. 
Geoffrey said,
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Look the strumpet is feeling the cold. Shall we heat her up. Lets use these.� 
He carefully did not say exactly what he meant by 'these' but there were several heavy leather straps 
and he picked one up. The four moved Janet over&nbsp; to the centre of the cave. There were several shackles set into the floor there so they fixed her feet feet to two of these which were about four feet apart. A spar of wood some seven feet long was laid across her back at shoulder level and her arms stretched out and tied to it. At each end this spar was attached to a rope fixed to the cave roof. There were many opportunities for them to maul, fondle, poke, pinch and otherwise play with Janet's naked flesh. It is fair to say very few, if any, were missed. Once she had been repositioned the brothers looked at Geoffrey. As current Club Chairman they would take their cue from him. He raised three fingers and&nbsp; gestured that they would all land their first lashes on the third count. When he was sure that all were clued in as to what was to happen he gave the signal. On the beat four blows landed near simultaneously on their victim's defenceless body. Her back, buttocks, breasts and belly were subjected to a sudden and violent attack. Each of the four landed about 30 powerful blows in less than a minute on their selected targets and the shock of the assault caused poor Janet to urinate. 
Geoffrey now said,
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�That will have warmed her up lads so shall we move on to loosening up her openings?� The tortured woman&nbsp; was completely exposed to their assault and Geoffrey first drove his cock into her cunt. George was behind her and he buggered her with gusto while James and Steven took to mauling her breasts. They each had a length of the cord used to suspend window sash weights and they tied these very tightly round the base of each breast. The way her boobs swelled and started to redden they found particularly intriguing.&nbsp; As the skin of the breasts tautened and her nipples swelled more and more.&nbsp; 
First Geoffrey then George ejaculated into their respective orifices. Before&nbsp; he was finished Geoffrey exclaimed ,
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�This cunt has just come. The whore is enjoying it.�
If she had hoped for relief at that point Janet was to be severely disappointed. As soon as the first shift had finished the second took over with renewed fervour. James had her cunt and Steven her ass. This time Geoffrey and George took a rest while their relatives buried their cocks into their prisoner's cunt and rear passage. It was James turn to exclaim once again that the female's tortured body was having an orgasm. Janet was trying her utmost to resist being betrayed by her body but the mass of stimulation with which her body was being assaulted in waves overcame all resistance. When James and Steven had been sated Geoffrey and George were refreshed and the relentless assault continued with&nbsp; the brothers exchanging their previous positions. This time Janet came twice before George had achieved his climax. Janet was now wholly unable to continue her resistance to the needs of her body and was surrendering herself to her assailant's attentions. When the first round of fucking concluded with Steven and James doing the honours&nbsp; Janet had come on not less than 6 occasions and was exhausted. Her breasts were enormously swollen and almost purple in colour with each almost the size of her head. Her nipples stood proudly to attention and were remarkably engorged. 

After a few moments rest James said quietly to the others to watch what he was about to do. He crept quietly up to Janet who was hanging with her head bent forward and her chest heaving as she gasped in air. He grasped her right breast and she moaned obligingly at the discomfort this was causing her. James then took out his pocket knife and cut the cord round her tit. He unwound the cord then drew back. Five seconds later Janet was writhing in agony with pain as the blood started to circulate once more through her breast. Her hands made attempt after fruitless attempt to rub the area from which the excruciating pain originated but all to no avail. George commented that the sight of her abused and beaten body, leaking copious quantities of spunk&nbsp; from both her cunt and arse, as she twitched and writhed with one breast bouncing, bound and tight as a drum on the one side of her chest and the other flapping and slapping on the other side was more titillating and stimulating than all of the etchings and drawings in his collection. When her blood supply had been restored and the pain subsided James went over and cupped her left breast. He flicked his index fingernail at her nipple and said to his victim in a whisper,
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�What would you give me if I were to rub your breast for you once I have cut the cord which binds it?
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Anything, everything, whatever you command ,� she said.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Clean our cocks with your mouth then and I'll give it some consideration. James replied.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Yes, yes, anything� she replied.

The brothers lowered the spar which kept her upright and allowed her to rest on her knees. In turn then they required her to suck every last drop out of each of their cocks. She obviously found this most distasteful. That, of course made it more enjoyable for the four rapists, and she wretched and choked throughout the whole time she was made to service their cocks in this way. 

What she did not expect was that when James cut the second&nbsp; cord and freed her left breast from its bondage he did not so much rub the tortured flesh as grab it, twist it, tear at it and severely maul it. He repeated this with her other mammary and left her in tears kneeling on the cave floor with her head hanging over her heaving chest. 

Geoffrey looked at his watch. Three hours had passed in an instant. (Not for Janet for whom it seemed like a lifetime). 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�By God look at the time. We'll have to clean up here and get back home.&nbsp; It will be all of 11 p.m. before we're back.� he said.
James offered to do the honours since he could not return home that night and would be staying in the cottage overnight. 

Steven said jovially,
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�No private experiments mind you. Thanks anyway.&nbsp; An extremely promising and satisfactory first test I must say. I presume we are all in agreement?� and with that the three left joking and laughing while discussing the events and sights of the evening.

James had some bread, cold meat, cheese water and wine with him in his carriage. He brought a bowl of water, a towel and some of the food into the cave and carefully locked both of the doors behind him. Taking appropriate precautions by chaining her hands and her legs together he then released Janet from the spar and the floor shackles. He also forbade her from removing her blindfold. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Clean yourself up you are a mess.� he said. �Do an acceptable job and I have some food here for you.�
 Janet realised she was starving, (in this part of the world starving has, to this day, retained the old meaning of feeling very cold as well as being hungry) and hurried to clean up her body. James 'kindly' assisted in drying her down. He then handed her a length of towelling with a hole for her head in the middle. He instructed her to put it on and gave her one of the lengths of cord, which he had used to tie her tits, to use as a belt. Next he passed over some of the cold meat, bread and cheese and told her to eat. She had finished her supper in less than an hour after the end of her cock cleaning session. James told her that the Club was not yet fully set up for hosting their sex slaves so, for the next night or two you she would sleep in her box. Food and water would be provided once a day. An adequate amount would be provided but it up to her to see that it lasted till the next day. Whenever any of the club members desire to they would be able to fuck her in any and every way they wished. He advised her to ensure that she&nbsp; gave complete satisfaction every time. He cautioned her that if her performance&nbsp; failed to give complete satisfaction the members would move on to providing stimuli which you would&nbsp; find particularly distressing. 
James said,
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�To put matters precisely you must fuck like your life depends on it. Be under no misconceptions, it does.�
With that he ordered into her box, locked it down and, having made sure all the lamps were extinguished and all doors locked he fed and watered his horse and went to bed in the cottage. 

James had the best night's sleep which he had enjoyed for some time. The promise held by the future looked to have significantly increased. Janet's sleep that night was less refreshing.

to be continued.
