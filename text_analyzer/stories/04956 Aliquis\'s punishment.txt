Aliquis' punishment

&nbsp;

Chapter
I.

&nbsp;

1.

&quot;So, what do you
want from me, exactly?&quot; asked Samir. &quot;I told you. I am retired.&quot;

I looked at the old
man. He was 5'3&quot; tall, extremely thin, almost skeleton like, completely
bald with some Arabic blood in his veins. He was a dreaded torture master. It
took months to get in touch with him. He is wanted in the two-third of the
civilized world.

And at last, I stood
in front of him.

&quot;Master Samir, I
have commited a terrible sin against my master.&quot; I replied in a weak
voice. I was unable to look into his eyes. They were like hollow pits.

&quot;Then your master
should punish you.&quot; he said.

&quot;He will. I think
he will crucify me and torture me to death perhaps.&quot; I looked down.

&quot;I see. Then what
do you want from me?&quot; he looked at me puzzled. 

&quot;It is a
sacrifice. I want to show him that I know how big my sin is. Perhaps I can
soften him.&quot;

&quot;And he shall
spare your life, eh?&quot;

&quot;No, it is not
important anymore! I just want to show him that I know what I deserve. I fear
that he would be too gentle. He loves me and I love him. And I can't let love
protect me from what I deserve.&quot;

Samir looked at me.
&quot;I see, I see. You seem to be very determined. If I say yes, you will have
obey to my rules.&quot;

&quot;Anything,
master!&quot; 

&quot;Hm. I did not say yes. But we could make a try,
though.&quot; He said

&quot;I'm so grateful,
master.&quot;

He chuckled a bit.
&quot;I'm doing this for 40 years now but no one was grateful ever. I'm afraid
soon you will regret this. Very soon.&quot; His voice
was cold as ice. &quot;Do you have some kind of conception?&quot;

&quot;Yes, master.
I've made a list. Of course you can change or add anything you like or think
necessary.&quot; I replied.

He read it over
quickly. He squinted at me doubtfully. &quot;Hmm...interesting
compilation you made...as I see you want some truly tough genital torture.&quot;

&quot;Yes, master. I
think I deserve the most serious tortures you can apply in order to make my
punishment worthwhile.&quot;

&quot;We'll see, we'll
see...but I would be really surprised if you can stand all this stuff. Moreover
it would take months to recover from the injuries...

&quot;I know about the
ointment...master.&quot; 

He stared at me. The
blood froze into my veins. &quot;What did you say?&quot; He stepped closer.

&quot;A...A victim of
yours babbled something about an ointment that cures wounds more rapidly than
anything else...&quot;

&quot;Yes...I know the
secret of that. It seems I got really rusty if a whelp like you could get such
information about me without my notice...Well, son, here's the deal. I do what
you want me to. But you stay here as long as I want. It could take months. You
will be a prisoner here. A painslave. But I will not
kill you or harm you permanently.&quot;

&quot;Deal.&quot; I said it without hesitation. 

&nbsp;

&quot;Fine
boy. I will give you some
sedative. It will make you fall asleep. When you'll wake up you will be at my
mansion.&quot; He put some liquid into a glass and gave it to me. I drank it. 

In a few minutes I
felt into a dreamless night.

&nbsp;

2. 

I woke up on a rusty,
smelly bed. The air was chilly and wet. I was under the ground. The room was
dimly lit. Samir sat on a chair next to the bed. My head was heavy a bit but I
was alright. 

&quot;Good morning,
son. Meet my assistant, Ahmed.&quot; Ahmed was a huge fat man. He did not look
to smart. &quot;He is my nephew. A bit simple minded. Seldom speaks but he does
everything I ask. I know that you are here by your own will but sometimes I
will need a helping hand.&quot;

&quot;Uhm, yes, I
think so.&quot;

&quot;Now, get up and
strip naked. Ahmed will take care of your cloths. You won't need them for a
while. Then Ahemed will lead you to the bath. He will help you to shave your
body completely.&quot;

I nodded. I stood up
and stripped. It was strange. Both of them looked at my emotionlessly. I gave
the cloths to Ahmed. He took them and went out from the room. I followed. 

In the next room there
were a big iron Jacuzzi and a shower. I washed myself and shaved my armpits,
arms, legs and my groin. When I finished Ahmed took the razor from me and
gently forced me to lean forward. I obeyed. He pulled my ass cheeks apart and
shaved my asshole too. Then he cut my hair too. I was like a newbie at the
army. Then he went out and showed me to follow. We entered a much bigger room.
In the center of the room there were two pillars,
chains were attached to them at top and at the bottom. Near to the pillar there
were a few cameras on tripods in the room, aiming the pillars from different
angels. Samir was there, setting the cameras. 

&quot;Ah, that was
quick!&quot; he smiled. &quot;Come closer, boy. I want to muster you closely. 

I stood in front of
him. He came closer and walked around me. &quot;Nice body, fine built muscles. Very well.&quot; Suddenly he took my penis in his hand. &quot;Uncut, great. Your cock is more sensitive then. How
big is it?&quot;

&quot;18 centimeters, master. If I am fully
aroused.&quot; I said in a weak voice. Samir took my ballsac into his
hand. &quot;Cough!&quot; I did. &quot;Fine. Big, healthy testicles. Very well.
Do you have any disease I have to know about?&quot; 

&quot;No master. I'm
completely healthy.&quot;

&quot;I hope so.
Because you will need all the toughness of this young and pretty body...Now
stand between the pillars!&quot;

I did as he ordered.
Ahmed came closer raised my arms and chained me to the pillars. He did this to
my ankles too. Samir turned the cameras on with a remote.

&quot;Look into this
one! He said. &quot;And tell your message to your master.&quot;

I looked into the
objective. &quot;My master Javier, I failed you. I want you to see that I know
how big my sin is. I know that these punishments won't ease your wrath but I
offer my sufferings to you as a sacrifice.&quot;

&quot;Brave
speech, boy. Now, we will
begin. Before every session I will describe what and how will happen. You might
scream, plea, beg, or curse...whatever you want. You can beg for me crying to
stop but I won't. There is no turning back. In some cases, I will give you some
stimulants to block your mind from losing consciousness. Three hours after each
session I will apply my ointment on you. I will let the pain take effect after
each session. Any questions, boy?&quot;

&quot;No,
master. I understand
everything.&quot; While he was speaking my cock got erect. It was pulsing,
aiming Samir.

He chuckled. &quot;Oh, my dear! Such a compliment.
I always like to torture a masochist...but let's start.&quot; He said and
nodded to Ahmed.

&quot;Now, Ahmed will
whip you.&quot; Samir gave a long, heavy bullwhip to Ahmed. &quot;He will give
you 20 strokes. For a starter. Then I will pour salty
water on your wounds.&quot;

I swallowed in fear.

Ahmed stood behind me.
I could hardly prevent my legs from trembling.

I heard as Ahmed
whirled the whip. Then a hissing sound and...I clenched my teeth and....

WHAAAAAACK!!! 

But nothing happened.
He was just trying the whip.

The real blow came
suddenly. WHAAAMMM!!!

Unbelievable pain bit
into my ass! I cried out loudly. I thought he will hit my back. 

I was much more worse than I imagined. I squirmed between the pillars.

Ahmed waited.
&quot;You thought it will be on your back, did't you?&quot; asked Samir.

&quot;Yes...yes...&quot;
I groaned.

&quot;Now. That is for real men. Whelps are punished on
their buttocks, you know.&quot; He laughed. 

WHACCCKK!!!

&quot;Goooooddd!!!!&quot; I yelled. My ass was on fire. I strained my
muscles against the chains. It was a futile effort. 

WHAMMMM!!! Ahmed
brought the lash onto my bare and bleeding ass with a tremendous force. I was
crying by then. And it was only the third one. 

Ahmed waited. I
stopped crying at last. Samir sat near in front of me, smoking a cigar. He
looked at me inquiringly.

Ahmed took a half
minute pauses between the lashes. It took almost half an hour and my ass and my
thighs were ruined. I was sobbing endlessly. My body was wet. On my chest, snot
and saliva glistered. I was half-dead of the pain. 

When I recovered a bit
Samir was standing in front of me. &quot;Well done, well done. You are awake. Surprising!&quot; He took a watering can from the ground and
walked behind me.

&quot;Before I wash
your ass with this, I want you to say to your master how much you sorry.&quot;

I looked up. I could
barely look through my tears. &quot;Master, I'm so sorry. Please, forgive
me!&quot;

I heard that Samir
raised the can and start to pour the salty water onto me.

AIIIIIEEEEEEEEEE....STOOOOPPP!!!!
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!

I can't find the
words. I was shrieking. My high toned howls echoed in the chamber. I was
jolting in my chains. The pain was horrible. I thought it would never end. It
seemed to an eternity. Samir firmly rubbed the water into my scarred ass with
his hand while pouring with the other!

&quot;PLEASE STOOOOP,
NOOOO, NOOOO, PLEASEEEE!!!!&quot; 

But he did not stop
until the last drop of the liquid hell was poured on me. 

He walked in front of
me and gave me two huge slaps. &quot;Wake up, slave, WAKE UP!&quot; I looked
into his coal-black eyes. &quot;This is the beginning. I will leave you here
for three hours. Think about your sins. Feel free to plea to the camera because
I will post it to your master today...&quot;

&quot;Please, don't
leave me here like this...free me...pleaseeee...master...forgive me....oh God,
it burns, pleaseeee...but Ahmed and Samir left the chamber.

&nbsp;

3. 

The hours passed with
an agonizing slowlyness. I couldn�t stand on my feet so I was hanging from the
chains. When wrists hurt too much I stood up a bit but I collapsed again. The
pain in my ass did not ease a bit. I felt that the salt eat itself into my
skin. It was constantly burning feeling. There was no escape from it. I
wimpled, squirmed, shook my body to get rid of the pain but it was useless. 

When three hours
passed Ahmed came back. He opened the manacles at my ankles first, then at my
wrists. I fell to the floor. I sobbed and whimpered. I did not notice that
Samir entered. He turned off the cameras. 

�Now I will cure your
ass. I will hurt a bit.� he said and crouched next to me. Then he greased
something onto my ass. It was hot and tingling. �Be still for a couple of
minutes. It will cure your skin rapidly.�

&nbsp;

The ointment was a
mysterious mixture from the ancient world. When I first heard about it, I did
not believe a word. But after I spoke with one of Samir's victims in an asylum
I've become curious. 

The effect was beyond
my imagination. After an hour my skin on my ass was flawless like a baby's. It
was against all the law of nature. But it was real. I touched myself and I felt
nothing special. 

Samir smiled at me.
&quot;Understand now? This ointment is priceless. But only four man knows the secret of it. And we made an oath that we
never give its secret away. With this mixture the balance of our society would
crash. The consequences are unpredictable. But this is unimportant from your
point of view now, my boy.&quot;

I stood up. I was
accustomed to be completely naked in the presence of my master so Samir I
wasn't embarrassed a bit.

&quot;It is really
unbelievable.&quot; I added. 

&quot;True. As you can
see, it is indispensable for our sessions. Because I will cause more serious
damages to you and I don't want to wait for weeks until you recover. So, I will
torture you in every two days, in different ways. Between two sessions you will
have to train your muscles in the gym here to keep fit. I want that your master
get you back in a great shape.&quot;

&quot;Thank you, my
master.&quot; I bowed before him.

&quot;Ahmed will lead
you to your cell. He will give you a plenty of food and drink and vitamins. Eat
everything. You will need every bit of your strength. Now go.&quot;

Ahmed led me into a very simple cell. Only a bed, a toilet seat and a
basin were in it. There were no windows at all and only a bare light bulb
hanged from the ceiling. In one of the upper corners, there was a security
camera. The food was tasty and more than I could eat. I took all the pills and
lied down. I felt asleep immediately.

�

4.

Ahmed woke me up.
Since there was no clock anywhere in the cell I had no idea how much time
passed. He gestured to follow him. We walked through a corridor and entered a
room which was filled with various kind of body building equipment. 

Samir was already
there. 

&quot;Good morning. It
is time for some exercise. Looking at you, you know how to use the equipment.
You have to work � constantly � for two hours. Then we will move out.&quot; He
left. Ahmed sat down and look in front of him without any expression on his
face.

I started with some
warming ups. Then I made 50 push-ups. It was somewhat exciting to make
exercises naked. My cock become a bit erect. If Ahmed
realized he didn't give a sign of it. Then I moved onto other exercises with
machines. By the end of the second hour my whole body was covered by sweat. My
muscles were firm like cables.

Samir came back.
&quot;Good, good. Nice sight. Now you can take a shower and eat. In the
afternoon you will have to another training session. Use the treadmill and the
bike for an hour each. You can take breaks but you will need better shape.

The second day past without quickly. In the evening Samir entered my cell. I stood
up and bowed to him.

&quot;Sit down, boy. I
want to talk with you about your whipping yesterday.&quot;

&quot;I'm listening,
master Samir.&quot;

&quot;There was a
second purpose why I choose the whip � next to the punishment. I wanted to know
how high your pain endurance is. However it is quite good I want to make myself clear once more. Tomorrow your true punishment will
begin. The whipping was only a slight introduction of what's ahead. I will
torture you so much that you will beg for death. You can't imagine how deep the
well of pain is, son.&quot; He looked deeply into my eyes. &quot;It is obvious
that you cannot estimate what awaits you. For people like me, torture is not
some kind of job. It is an art. Causing pain and make the victim to live
through it as deeply and fully as it biologically possible. To make them
realize that there is nothing left in this whole reality for them but pain and
suffering.&quot;

He paused. I remained
silent. Perhaps that was my chance to withdraw. But I had made mind up.

&quot;Silence is
agreement, I presume. I told you everything you should know. We will start
tomorrow morning.&quot; He went out and left me alone with my thoughts. &quot;I
will be strong. He and my master will see how strong and determined I am!&quot;


Looking back, I was a
fool.

Chapter II.

&nbsp;

1. 

Ahmed led me into
another chamber. In a corner, there was a kind of gynecological chair with
numerous leather straps on it. In front of it, there was a metal stool. At the
wall a large metal table stood. My eyes got wide when I saw the devices on it.
There were syringes, clamps, electronical units, needles and pincers, rubber
gloves, lubricants, and so on. Above the table there were two windowed closet
filled with similar stuff. 

The sharp light came
from the surgical lamp hoisted above the chair. Two cameras aimed the chair.

&quot;Sit on!&quot;
Samir ordered. I swallowed and tried not to show how frightened I have become.
Two days ago, at the whipping post, I found the whole stuff very arousing. Now
I was terrified. Te air was quite chilly I got goose bumps. My penis was small
as a thumb.

I sit onto the chair.
It was cold as ice. Ahmed restrained my legs at my ankles and at my knees, then
he pulled my arms backward and down and fastened it to the chair. Finally, he
put a strap under my navel. I couldn't move a bit. 

Samir checked the
strains and started to wind something behind the chair. I felt that the angular
offset of the backrest of the chair become more and more concave, forcing my
chest outward. It was really uncomfortable. The straps bit into my wrists. He
stopped when my ribs started to show under my pecs. I was heaving heavily by
then.

The master sat down in
front of the chair, between my widespread legs. Ahmed turned the cameras on.

&quot;Ahmed, please,
give me the serum.&quot; The servant gave a syringe filled with yellow fluid to
Samir. 

&quot;W-What's
that?&quot; I whimpered.

&quot;Just some
stimulants, nevermind.&quot; He injected the serum into a vein on my ankle.
&quot;Now, give me those small needles. Yes, those.&quot; Ahmed gave him two,
approximately 1.5 inches long, very thin needles. 

&quot;These are
acupunctural needles. I will insert them under your scrotum, into your taint.
They won't hurt but will make you erect as long as they are stabbed in
you.&quot; I felt two small sting then after a few seconds I felt that the
blood flows into my penis. After a minute my penis was fully erect, throbbed
like I was being sucked. A few drops of precum glistered at the head of it.

&quot;Hm, I like your
cock. It so firm and straight. But back to business, Ahmed the string,
please!&quot;

&quot;Now, I will
force your cock down a bit, in order to reach it better. It will hurt a bit,
but you will get used to it in a few minutes.&quot; Therefore, he attached the
string to my cock and slowly pulled it down. When it was pointing to his face,
he fastened it to the table. It was very unpleasant but I took it without a
sound.

&quot;Splendid,
splendid. As I said, I will describe what I'm going to do with you. Today, I
will do something, which your master will appreciate a lot. I will brand you. I
will burn his name into your glans with this.&quot; He put a pen-like soldering
iron onto a small table between us. 

Cold sweat covered me
at once. I stared at the dreaded tool. 

&quot;What is your
master name?&quot; Samir asked.

I look at him
startled. &quot;J...Javier.&quot;

&quot;No. He is Master Javier. That's 15 lines. It will
cover your precious cock, my boy.&quot; He smiled.

&quot;B..but...oh
God...please...I'm not ready for this, master!&quot; I started to panic. 

&quot;Not ready, you
say?&quot; Samir laughed. &quot;After all, what were you thinking when you came
to me?&quot; he raised his voice. &quot;You said you want genital torture,
didn't you?&quot;

He did not wait for my
answer. &quot;Now you will get it. I warned you twice. There is no turning
back. You only bring more shame on yourself with this whining, boy. I think
your master will be displeased. Again.&quot;

Samir turned the
soldering iron on. Then he took it into his right hand, holding it like a pen.

I gazed at the steel
tip of the device as Samir slowly approached with to my penis.

&quot;Letter M.&quot;
he stated.

I don't think one can
imagine the anguish that fell upon me. There was a faint sizzling sound as the
iron reached my most sensitive bodypart.

I screamed like a
banshee. My lung was burning because of the sudden strain. With all my
strength, I tried to move myself away but I was unable to move even an inch.

&quot;Please, master,
pleaseeeee, nooooo, no more, pleeaseeee.&quot; I cried as Samir finally pulled
the iron away from my cock. When I looked down, I saw a small, blood red letter
M facing to Samir on my rock hard glans. 

&quot;Poor boy, only
now you understand what the word: pain, really means. And this is only the
beginning.&quot; He said and touched my tool again.

I wailed with all my
might. I cried and I couldn't move my sight away from my tortured cock. When he
finished the second letter, I could smell the scent of my own burning flesh in
the room. I couldn't stop sobbing. &quot;Oh God, please! This is a mistake! Let
me go, please, let me goooo!!! I can't take anymore!!!&quot;

Samir waited. He
continued the torture only when I eased a bit. He was merciless. He wrote every
letter with a slow accuracy. Nearly after an hour, he finished the first word.

When I looked down I
saw the six marks of my agony on the left side of the head of my cock:

MA

ST

ER

&quot;Now we take some
break.&quot; Said Samir.

I was unable to speak.
I just trembled and sobbed in the chair, if I hadn't been drugged I would have
lost my consciousness a hundred times I believe. But despite I was half-mad of
the pain, I remained awake.

After a while, Samir
came back with a cup of coffee. 

He sipped a bit and
said &quot;Okay, let's continue.&quot;

&quot;Master, in the
name of all saints, please...stop torturing me, please...I repented my sins,
please...no more...oh God it hurts so much...oh God...&quot; I whimpered
endlessly.

Samir laughed.
&quot;Oh, my dear boy, this is only our second session! Much more awaits you!
You were wise when you came here. You knew that you wouldn't had the strength
to carry through this. But I will help you.&quot;

&quot;But I can't
stand this...Jesus...please...my cock...oh God...&quot;

&quot;I know it hurts.
That's the point, you know. In a moment I will burn you again.&quot; He
switched the machine on. &quot;Don't fight against the pain. It is impossible
to endure such anguish. No man could do that.&quot;

&quot;Then what the
fuck should I do?&quot; I yelled.

Samir remained calm.
&quot;Nothing. Just accept it. Shriek your agony into the world and show your
master that you really love him and you are truly sorry for what you did.&quot;
He took the iron into his hand and pressed it to me.

I took his advice. I
didn't fight anymore. I wailed hysterically. With an agonizing slowlyness line
followed by line letter by letter. I did not beg or plea, I just cried
endlessly. 

After each letter,
Samir stopped for a while. He waited until the pain lessened a bit.

At the end of the
word:

JA

VI 

ER

My throat became so
sore that I was unable to scream. Only some kind of miserable whining came out
from me. 

Only two hours passed
but I was changed for a lifetime. Samir opened a new dimension of pain to me.
Before I came here, I could not imagine that such inhuman pain exists. 

&nbsp;

A splash of ice-cold
water woke me from the delirium. I choked and coughed. Ahmed poured the rest of
the water on me. 

I felt that he loosens
my restraints. I could not walk. He grabbed me under my left arm and dragged me
on foot. He literally pulled me into my cell and threw me onto the bed.

I felt into a feverish
dream. 

&nbsp;

I don't know how much
I was sleeping. When I woke up, I felt the stabbing pain in my cock
immediately. I looked down and saw that my foreskin was pulled and banded back
and my glans � oh God my branded glans � were showing. The throbbing pain was
so intense that I was crying in pain during peeing.

In few minutes, Samir
entered. I was still sitting on the toilet, sobbing.

Samir carried a
medical case. 

&quot;Sit on the
bed.&quot;

I obeyed. He examined
my cock, real gently. He poured some jelly onto it. &quot;Good. It will heal in
a couple of days.&quot;

&quot;B-but I
thought...&quot;

&quot;The ointment,
eh? No, my son. That is for injuries that might hinder our sessions. However
this is a very painful injury it won't make you incapacited.&quot; He stood up.
&quot;So, eat � if you can � and go into the gym.&quot;

&quot;Master, I don't
think I can...&quot;

&quot;If you can't
that means we have to spend this day with other things...by now you might have
some idea what that means...&quot; he smiled. 

I stood up, trembling.


&quot;Don't be afraid.
Ahmed will ensure that you will do the exercises.&quot;

&nbsp;

When I entered the
gym, Ahmed was in there already. He held a cat o' nine tails made of raw hide.

I slowly started the
training. After the warm up, I sat on the bench pad and took some deep breath. Nearly
a moment passed when I heard a sweeping sound and I felt fiery pain on my back.


&quot;Do.&quot; Said
Ahmed. He had a low and raspy voice.

I did what I could.
Ahmed gave me five more strokes. After the fifth, near at the end of the second
hour I collapsed on the ground crying. Ahmed hit me again. I tried to round
myself as much I could. 

&quot;Enough,
Ahmed!&quot; Samir's voice cut into the air. &quot;Enough for today. Bring him
back to his cell. He needs sleep. Many experiences await him tomorrow.&quot;

Chapter 3. 

&nbsp;

1.

It was a long,
dreamless night. I felt much better. In the next week I rarely saw Master
Samir. He said my only duty is working out. Ahmed was always present at my work
outs, but he didn't have to use the whip. In a few days I was in a great shape
again. My muscles were showing under my skin. 

&nbsp;

Then in the morning
I woke up when the cell door opened and Ahmed came in. Ahmed stepped behind me,
pulled my arms back and handcuffed me. Fear struck me suddenly. 

&nbsp;

Ahmed tossed me
forward. He led me through corridors, then downstairs. The air was pretty
chilly and since I was naked, I got goose-bumps.

&nbsp;

Finally we entered
into a room which was surely underground.

Master Samir was
already in the chamber.

Lit by torches on
the walls, a wheel rack stood in the middle of the dungeon on a raised stone
plinth, a macabre shrine to suffering and torture. It was just under six feet in diameter, although its
slight elevation on wooden supports from its heavy base added a little height.
It was crafted with skill; a thick, solid, heavily-studded rim mounted on heavy
cross-beam spokes. It was turned by an iron cog, in turn operated by a
ratcheted lever.

The
&quot;rim&quot; of the wheel, the curved surface of its circumference, was
nearly three feet wide. Near the upper curve were bolted two lengths of chain,
ending in open manacles. To the wooden base, immediately below the foremost
extreme of the wheel's rim, two more chains and manacles.

Ahmed pushed me
closer to the wheel rack. It was terrifying to see it up close. The iron studs
in particular look gruesome and forbidding.

It took every
last ounce of courage not to run straight for the door. Instead, I let Ahmed
guide me up onto the stone plinth, and stood in place alongside the big wheel.
Its iron-studded curve brushed my shoulder blades icily. Ahmed knelt at my
feet, gathered up one of the manacles, and fit it around my ankle.

Shackles. I was
immediately reminded of its heaviness, the solid metal weighty and cold against
my skin. Ahmed locked it shut, fastening it with a small padlock, and let it
drop; it rested against my ankle bone and the top of my foot. He placed the
second shackle around my other ankle, locked it, and checked the chains.

My feet were
secured to the wooden base.

Firmly, Ahmed
held out his hand again for my wrist. He lifted my left wrist to the open
manacle, which lay against the curve of the wheel. He closed the thick, cold
iron around my wrist and locked it, again with a small padlock. He did the same
with my right wrist, and as the padlock clicked shut, I felt a fresh prickle of
sweat over my body. With my arms slightly raised, I was completely helpless,
utterly in the power of my tormentors.

Samir took a
syringe filled with yellow liquid and gave me a shot. Then he looked into my
eyes.

&quot;This rack
is turned by a simple gearing mechanism,&quot; Samir explained indifferently.
&quot;An easy movement of the lever � thus � causes the wheel to shift
about one half of a degree, effecting a stretch of one third of an inch.&quot;
He cranked the lever to demonstrate, and the big wheel groaned, turned
fractionally. 

Here goes. 
I felt sweat
prickling along my hairline, down my spine. My heart was pounding almost
painfully. My throat was suddenly dry. 

I automatically
grasped the chains that run upwards from the wrist manacles. My toes curled and
rubbed against the wood beneath them. I was acutely conscious of my nakedness,
my vulnerability. I was aware of how fragile my flesh must seem, alongside the
heavy mechanisms of the wheel rack.

Click - beep.

Ahmed turned the
cameras on.

Samir grabbed the
lever, but instead of turning it, simply agitated it back and forth slightly,
drawing deep clanking sounds from the ratchet mechanism. It sent a wave
of anticipation through me, so intense that it seemed to burn inside my belly.
My heart felt like a fluttering bird in my chest. I moved my hands a little,
the chains knocking on the wood above my head.

Samir pulled the
lever.

The wheel
groaned, creaked, and shifted, and I felt the chains draw on my wrists. Another
notch. Then another. Little by little, as the wheel rotated, my hands inched
higher. Click, click, click � the anticipation deepened into a kind of
dread as I began to experience the slow, inexorable progress of the turning
rack. 

A strange thought
rose in me. Something was different. Samir was different. My thoughts were
stopped by another click.

As my wrists were
drawn upwards, they were also drawn backwards, following the curve of the
wheel. It arched my back, so that the cold iron studs dig uncomfortably into my
back and shoulders. My spine began to extend, my breasts lifting, my belly
hollowing, my armpits and ribcage exposed, and my sense of helplessness grew
with my discomfort.

A fraction of an
inch at a time, my arms were drawn to their full extent over my head. My back
arched more severely as my body followed the curve of the wheel, my shoulders,
shoulder blades, lower back and now buttocks all pressed against the cruel iron
studs, while my legs extended straight down. With the next few notches, my
heels rose off the platform, so that I was standing on the balls of my feet. It
was very uncomfortable, even the mere act of breathing caused the studs in my
back to painfully press into my flesh. The manacles were biting into my wrists.

A droplet of
sweat slid down the arch of my ribcage from one underarm. My whole body felt
unnaturally strained already. It was an effort to even lift my head. My arms,
although not truly stretched, were feeling the pressure of my body's weight.

&quot;Today I
want more than the usual. There is another purpose � besides punishment � to
this torture.&quot; says Samir.

&quot;W-what is
it??&quot; I get scared even more. I knew already that he was going to torture
me again. But for what else than being unfaithful to my master?

Samir said
nothing more, but smiled, and returned to the lever.

I closed my eyes.

The wheel shifted
as he hauled on the lever, and on its studded rim, I was lifted a little
further by my shackled wrists. My body, curved backwards, stretched a little
under the gentle urge of gravity; but I knew there were much crueller forces
waiting to act upon it. Another notch, and I was on tiptoes. My legs were at
full stretch. I could feel the muscles of my calves knotting with the strain.
The iron manacles seemed to burn into my wrist bones, my hands tingling.

Samir drew the
lever again. The wheel groaned, and my toes cleared the ground. For the first
time, I was half-suspended over the circumference of the wheel. It drew a grunt
from my throat. The studs in my back and the iron on my wrists were painful,
the arching of my back a considerable discomfort also. Another notch, and with
ease, the wheel lifted my body back-and-up on its arc. I could feel the weight
of the fetters and chains hanging off my ankles. The position was seriously
uncomfortable to the extent of being a battle to endure.

I flexed my toes,
trying to reach the ground as Samir cranked the lever again. I could not touch
it. Looking down, I could only see my own naked chest, my pecs drawn almost
flat into my ribcage, but my nipples jutting like small berries into the air.
The curve of my body was such that I could see no further without lifting my
head.

Another notch,
and I felt, for the first time, the tug of the manacles on my ankles. It was
only subtle, but enough to tell me that the chains had drawn taut. My toes must
have been at least six inches off the ground. The discomfort through my arched
body was severe.
The rack began
its work.

The manacles on
my wrists hauled my hands a fraction of an inch further, while the manacles and
chains on my ankles held my feet in place. Tension translated all along my
arms, my spine, and down my legs; the tension of a yoga stretch.

&quot;Ahh�&quot;
It was only
a forced release of breath from the awkwardness of my arched position, but it
prompted Samir to take his hand from the lever.

&quot;I believe
it is the most appropriate at this point,&quot; he said, &quot;to let you dwell
on your pending agonies for a time?&quot;

&quot;What do you
want from me, master?&quot; I tried to hide my fear from my voice.

The dungeon door
shut with a thud. I heard the clunk of its bar sliding into place.

Then, silence.
Utter and absolute.

I was naked and
cold, half-hanging across the curve of the wheel, shackled at the wrists and
ankles and mildly stretched. And utterly, completely helpless. The iron studs
dug into my back, but I could not move to relieve their painful pressure, nor
could I ease the hot bite of iron on my wrists and ankles. I could only endure.

Minutes pass. I
did not have any way of gauging time, but I knew it had been more than two. It
had been more than five. And still no hint that Samir was returning. The
pain was growing worse as time passes and the cold gnawed into my body. I was
fighting the urge to shiver, which would only make things worse.

Minute after slow
minute.

I tipped my head
back, an effort in itself, and looked towards my own shackled wrists. The heavy
iron sat snugly around my wrists, locked shut with the padlocks. I could not,
in a thousand lifetimes, free myself.

&quot;Master&quot;


My voice barely
even reverberated in the dungeon enclosure, muted by the thick bedrock from
which it was hewn. I doubted that it would even be heard beyond the door, let
alone along the narrow fifty-foot tunnel that lead to another heavy wooden
door, beyond which was labyrinthine gloom of Samir's dungeons. I could scream
and yell, but I would never be heard. Nobody but Samir knew I was there - and
nobody ever came in here by chance.

&quot;Mas-teeee-eeer&quot;

Unexpectedly,
panic arrived. It was overwhelming. My heart-rate surged. The sweat burst from
every pore. The adrenaline pounded and gave my muscles new strength; the pain
of my strained position was immediately forgotten. I began thrashing as much as
I could, which amounted to little more than tensing my arms and waggling my
feet slightly against the tension of the chains. I twisted and turned my hands
in the manacles, reaching my fingers for the padlocks. I caught the lock on my
left wrist-manacle between two fingers, but was only able to tug at it feebly.

So I gritted my
teeth and put even more effort into it, every last ounce of my strength, until
my muscles are pronounced and hard with straining, my limbs shaking in the
effort to pull myself free - even though I know, as a torturer myself, that
I will not escape. The iron studs bite and press into my flesh, only bringing
more pain.

I was
helpless.

Maybe more than
an hour. But even that eventually dissipated, until there was nothing left but
the chill eating into my bones, the iron studs boring into my flesh, the
shackles eating into my wrists and ankles, and the ache of fatigue eating into
my muscles. 

More than an hour
after Samir left me alone down here, the pain began to gnaw at me. My back was
hurting. Not just the flesh where the iron studs were digging, but a deep pain
in my spine, in the muscles of my shoulders and lower back. In the tendons.
Being arched backwards for such a long time was an unnatural and forced
position, and my body was feeling it.

It was the same
with my arms. They ached. The muscles, the joints, the tendons. A dull, deep
ache, as if there are bone-deep bruises. Only my legs, stretching down towards
the ankle manacles, were relatively free of pain.

I had lost count
of the minutes. But it seemed that at least another hour crawled by, and I
remained secured on the wheel rack, helpless, and in silence. Down there, it
was cold; barely sixty degrees Fahrenheit, and the chill seemed to eat into my
helpless body. My nipples stood hard on my flattened chest. Goosebumps textured
my bare skin. My teeth started to chatter. But I was helpless.

Perhaps another
hour passed. Perhaps two hours. Perhaps only half an hour.

I had no way of
knowing. It felt like an eternity. I began to feel detached from the real
world, detached from my own identity. Being like that, arched and naked on a
device of torture, I was reminded that all I really have in this world is my
own body. And even that, even the temple of my flesh and blood, could be ripped
apart.

Time crept. 

I was in a numb
daze when I heard sounds. A rattling at the dungeon door. The bar was drawn,
and I heard the door creak open.

&quot;Fighting
against it?&quot; Samir entered, re-locking the door behind him, then stepping
up onto the plinth. &quot;You look cold,&quot; he said, noting my chattering
teeth, my bullet-hard nipples. 

&quot;Take me
off, Master. Please.&quot; 

&quot;No.&quot;

Samir looked
straight into my eyes. I looked into his. There was absolute seriousness in his
tone. What else does he want? I was suddenly more scared than I have
ever been. Samir moved to the lever of the wheel rack. I had already tested my
restraints many times, and I knew myself to be truly helpless, but my heart
quickened with an impulse to try and escape as he grasped its stout wood.

&quot;Where is
your brother?&quot; Samir asked suddenly.

&quot;What???
What?&quot; I was shocked. How on earth did he find out? &quot;What are you
talking about?&quot;

&quot;You find
me. You know me. I want to ensure that you never betray me. I have to know
where he is. It is a kind of...self-insurance.&quot;

My thoughts were
racing. My brother, barely 17, was my only living relative. The only one whom I
care for. He was being raised by foster parents but I know where he lived. I
couldn't let those ruthless people hurt him. He had nothing to do with that
whole mess!

&quot;I have no
brother!&quot; I yelled. 

Samir smiled and
pulled the lever. The mechanism of the rack groaned, the wheel shifted, and as
my body was wrenched upwards, my legs felt the stretch most, as they pulled
against the ankle manacles. He found another notch, and with the wheel's next
shift, I felt a hot, burning pain deep in my hips, mirrored by pain in my lower
back.

I felt my head
move suddenly with the sharpness of pain. &quot;Oh, it hurts!&quot;

&quot;So, where
is he?&quot;

&quot;I said it
before. I don't know! What the fuck do you want! I�m an only child!&quot;

He pulled the
lever again

I was stretched,
and a fiery pain filled my hips and lower back, and seemed to spread up my
spine. I felt it in my shoulders, now, too; quickly overshadowing the pain of
the manacles and the iron studs that dug into my flesh. The pain of being
stretched was far more intense, like fire along my bones.

&quot;Ohh!!
Master!&quot; I gasped. &quot;I Pleaseee!&quot; I desperately tried to adjust
to the pain.

&quot;I hear what
you are saying, boy.&quot; Samir said, and cranked me another notch. The wheel
creaked, but I also heard my spine pop, and hot pain flashed along my back,
down through my legs. It seemd to tear up through my shoulders, too, and I gave
an involuntary groan.

&quot;Master,
please, stop, stop for a moment! God, it really hurts now!&quot;

&quot;Do have
something to say?&quot;

&quot;Seriously,
Master, it hurts! Oh God! I have no...oh...&quot; I could feel my body's
response to pain, now; sudden profuse sweat all over my bare skin. I felt hot,
even in the dungeon's chill. The pain was intense, fiery. &quot;Oh, shit �
that's bad �&quot; My breathing was shallow, my ribcage already expanded by the
arching of my back, and I could feel my pounding heart thumping against my
spine.

&quot;Tell me. Do
you really think that a whelp like you won't break under my hands? Don't make
me laugh,&quot; he chuckled. &quot;I have broken much tougher men than you,
kid. Just tell me what I want to know. Or be stubborn...&quot; He reached for
the lever again.

&quot;No -
Master, no!&quot; I shouted, but he pulled the lever anyway. As the
wheel moved, my wrists were drug a fraction of an inch further, my ankles
remained anchored, and my body was stretched. New pain filled my hips, spread
up my back, breathtakingly huge. I felt my eyes widen, and I gave an
involuntary groan. Quickly, there came an intense agony in my arms, too,
seeming to spread from my armpits up to my elbows, hot pain as if a scalpel has
sliced along the bone.

&quot;Oh Jesus,
Master! Fuck!&quot; I squealed. &quot;Ahh, shit!!&quot; I started to shake my
head. &quot;No, I have no brother!!! Pleaseee!&quot; I could feel droplets of
sweat running down my face, beading up on my drawn pecs and my taut belly. 

Samir let go of
the handle, but left the rack secured.

&quot;Listen. Just give me an
address. I won't hurt him. I swear. I just want you to know if you hurt me I
can hurt you too. That's all.&quot; 

I couldn't let my little brother
get involved. Oh Jesus, what had I done!

As I was
thinking, Samir was returning to the lever. I suddenly found myself gibbering.
&quot;Please - no, no, not that, pleasee -&quot;

He cranked the
lever. 

The wheel groaned
around, and my body was stretched. As the pain flared brutally down through my
legs, up my spine, up through my arms, it was liberating just to let out a
shriek of pain, although I was able to stifle it quickly. 

Another notch of
the rack, and my scream was high and frantic, my mouth wide, as the fire
intensified along my limbs. I heard my joints crack in succession, a
creaking from my tearing spine.

&quot;Oh God!!
Samir!! Aaah!!&quot; 

&quot;Give what I
want.&quot; He voice as cold as ice.

&quot;Samir,
please, please, I can't stand the pain,&quot; I babbled out. The sweat
was stinging my eyes, so that I could barely see. &quot;Please,
just loosen the rack!&quot;

&quot;Fool
kid&quot; Samir added and cranked the lever again. Raw and terrible agony
exploded along my legs and arms, and it felt as if my abdominal muscles were
tearing, my spine breaking apart. I wasn't even aware of screaming for the
first several seconds; it was a completely involuntary reaction to the pain: I
was making woooaaah - woooo - ooooh - aaaahh noises at the top of my
lungs.

When at last I
could contain my screaming, the tears flooded from my eyes, spilling down my
cheeks.

&quot;Oh God,
Master, please, please stop,&quot; I sobbed. &quot;I'm begging you,
now!&quot;

Without hurry, he
stepped from the lever and stood close to my wrenched body. Even stretched back
over the wheel, with my toes high off the ground, his face was almost at the
same level with mine.

&quot;I admit you
are tough. But this session is out of our deal. I won't spare this&quot; he
gently stoked my ribs and abs &quot;magnificent body.&quot;

&quot;Aahhh �
&quot;� was all I could say.

&quot;Shall I
repeat my demands?&quot;

I realized I was
in no position at all to deny him. &quot;Samir, ple-e-e-ase,anything but
this!!!&quot; I wailed.

&quot;So
beautiful.&quot; He put his hand to my solar plexus. Stretched this taut, I
could barely breathe, only my drum-tight belly shifting with desperate little
fish-gasps of air. He trailed his fingers up over my ribcage - bump-bump-bump
over each rib - then the slight swell of my pecs. His palm brushed the hard
pencil-eraser of my nipple, but I was unable to flinch from his touch. Then he
moved his hand downwards on my side. Finally he reached my groin. I loathed his
touch. Only when he touched my cock did I realize that it was rock hard. The
pain shrouded my senses. He grabbed it and stroked a bit. 

&quot;Don't be
surprised. Even normal men got erect sometimes during torture.&quot;

I felt utterly
humiliated; but it was nothing compared to the agony in my stretched body.
&quot;Please, Master, just loosen it a little,&quot; I sobbed.

&quot;You know,
you leave me no choice.&quot;

As he stepped
back to the lever, fresh terror hit me. &quot;Master! No! No!&quot;

But I couldn't
stop him; the cogs turned, and the big wheel shifted slightly with a
sailing-ship creak. The hot, tearing agony that exploded all along my limbs and
torso was incredible, intense, overwhelming, and that time I couldn't stop my
screams.

When I didn't
have enough breath, I simply groaned in agony. I was sure my back was about to
break. My hips felt as if they are being ripped apart, my shoulders likewise.
The ravaging agony was so intense that I couldn't even feel the manacles on my
wrists and ankles any more.

&quot;Okay!&quot;
I managed to squeal. &quot;You win! I have a brother!! But we haven't met in
years! He can't hurt you!! He is just a child!!!&quot;

He looked at with
his reptile-like eyes.

I could barely
speak. &quot;Please - Master, please - loosen it� oh God, I can't stand it � it
hurts so much �!&quot;

&quot;I know he
can't hurt me. I will not hurt him either. Just tell me where he lives.&quot;
Through eyes swimming in tears of pain I saw Samir's blurred shape move away
from the lever, and I gave a wail of horror, knowing that he wasn't going to
ease my agony yet. 

&quot;Oh God,
Master, I don't know, I can't think, please, you're killing me!&quot;

&quot;Tell me the
address.&quot; Samir said.

I remained
silent. 

Samir sighed.

Samir went behind
me and returned with a candle in his hand. The candle was six inches tall, two
inches across, with a thick and heavy wick. He placed it where I could see it,
slowly picking up a matchbox, striking a single match, and touching it to the
wick. The flame caught, fluttered, then built into a tall, bright upside-down
teardrop, its peak tapering to a reddish-orange, a slender thread of smoke
sliding upwards into the cool air.

&quot;I will ask
you again, boy,&quot; Samir said slowly. He lifted the candle and held it in
front of me. Held taut and helpless on the wheel-rack, I could not even
struggle, only gaze in horror at the bright point of light.

&quot;Oh shit �
please,&quot; I whimpered. &quot;I do not know the answer.&quot;

There was a
shallow channel that ran from just beneath my well built pecs down to my
belly-button; tanned skin beaded with perspiration, heaving with shallow breath.
It was to this flinching skin that he first brought the candle flame, holding
it close so that I felt the bite of heat, my sweat turning to steam.

&quot;Uuhh!&quot;
I moaned, trying to suck in my stomach. He brought the flame close again, just
kissing my skin, and there was a soft hiss and I again cried out.
&quot;Oh, fuck, fuck it hurts! Stop, please!&quot;

&quot;Talk. Talk
or it gets worse for you!&quot;

&quot;I do not
know! I don't know what you ask!&quot;

Samir touched me
again with the candle, holding it longer to my flesh, burning slowly down the
line of my solar plexus, and the skin crackled and reddened in the flame's
savage path. I gave a scream of pain, my head whipped from side to side, and
the sweet odour of burning sweat and my skin filled my nostrils.

&quot;I ask
again!&quot;

Tears were
spilling from my eyes. &quot;Please, stop!&quot; I begged.

The candle flame
kissed my belly again, fleeting visits that burnt my skin and drew shrieks from
my lungs. The burns were only superficial, but they hurt badly enough to bring
a fresh beading of sweat over my tightly-pulled body. 

&quot;No!!&quot;

Lower. Halfway
down my stomach, tiny peach-fuzz hairs vaporising and skin searing under the
candle's razor-touch. My body jolted within the unforgiving tension of the
rack, and again I shrieked in pain.

&quot;Ohhhh
fu-u-uck! It hu-u-urts! Stop! Stop!!&quot;

&quot;Your skin
is blistering, kid.&quot; He touched me with the flame, barely above my navel;
hissing sweat and crackling skin and another shriek from me. I could smell my
own burning flesh.

But that has only
been an introduction to the candle's searing touch. I knew that it can get
much, much worse. Samir ran his fingertips down over the corrugations of my
ribcage, the taut skin of my belly, then flicked them through the shallow dip
of my navel. I caught my breath, helpless in anticipation.

A moment later,
he touched and held the candle's flame to my belly button. It licked into the
slight hollow with the sound of sizzling sweat, and I gave a shriek, then
another, then a cry of pain. He didn't lift the candle away, but held it in
place, letting the flame flutter and burn, tearing at my sensitive skin, while
wax dripped to land on my erect penis beneath. I could do nothing but shriek
and wail with the pain as a long scorch-mark slowly formed above my burning
navel. 

The agony as my
belly-button was burned seemed to bore all the way to my spine, and despite the
tension of the rack, I tried to writhe my hips and escape the agony; but I was
held firmly under the candle's searing touch, and as the pit of my navel
reduced to black char, my screams were filled with horror and pain.

When he finally
withdrew the flame, my cries trail off into a long wail. I was running with
sweat, every muscle pumped from my fruitless struggles. My pecs bounced on my
chest with my rapid, panting breath.

&quot;I'm running
out of patience, kid&quot; Samir warned. &quot;Where does your brother live?
What is his address?&quot;

I was weeping.
&quot;I don't know any of that, I swear!&quot;

With one finger,
Samir gently flicked the swollen tip of my erect left nipple. 

&quot;Oh shit,
no, no no!&quot; I saw the candle being brought close; I tried to lift my head
from between my arms, desperately trying to blow out the flame but the arch of
my body and the tautness of the rack meant that I could not get the angle nor
the air to do it. I puffed uselessly a few times. He waited until I was done,
then brought the flame underneath my nipple.

It was quite
magical, the way my nipple parted the flame. Two halves of a single flame
wrapped almost lovingly around my nipple, and there was a hissing, a crackling.
Then I screamed as the pain hit me, eyes bugging from my head and every muscle
rigid. The pain bore deeply into my flesh, and my head began to whip from side
to side in helpless agony.

Samir had lifted
the candle flame away before anything more than superficial damage was done,
but he burnt my right nipple instead. Again the crackle of searing flesh, and
again I gave horrible shrieks of pain.

Left. Right.
Left. Right. He shifted the candle from one pec to the other, just letting the
flame caress my erect and now weeping nipples. Quickly they darkened, the top
layers of skin charring, then splitting to expose fresh, sensitive flesh
beneath.

&quot;Oh please,
oh please!!&quot; I shrieked. Tears coursed down my face. &quot;Stop,
stop, please stop!&quot;

&quot;Reveal what
you know!&quot; he shouted. &quot;You are holding back from me! Talk, and it
stops!&quot;

My mouth still
open, my face screwed up in pain, I wailed in a whirl of confusion, but I was
still not ready to give up the only person whom I really cared for. So he put
the candle to my nipple once more, and burned flesh smoked again as the flame
curled around it. I shrieked and cried in agony.

Left nipple.
Right nipple. Left, right, until the swollen nodes of flesh were charred and
misshapen, and I was arched and groaning on the curve of the rack. Both nipples
were almost burned through; and yet I had not been broken. I knew I had a high
threshold to pain, but I never imagined that I could hold out so long. But I
knew I have not achieved anything other than prolonging my nightmare. I knew
it, and Samir could see that I was trying to convince myself that I could
endure more.

&quot;Give he
four notches, Ahmed&quot; he yelled.

My� body was already tightly stretched, and as
the wheel creaked and shifted, hot agony flashed through my limbs, brutal and
tearing. I gave a high-pitched wail.

Another notch,
forcing my joints to accommodate. Intense pain bedded at the base of my spine
flared through the muscles of my belly.

Another notch,
and deep popping sounds came from between my vertebrae, dragging another wail from
my lungs.

With the final
notch, I gave a cry that I barely managed to contain again. My world was
becoming diluted pain. My limbs burned, my spine hurt badly, my burnt
belly-button and nipples tormented me in slow, searing waves of agony. 

The candle was
burning bright and steady when Master Samir brought it close to my face. I
whimpered, trying to turn away from its heat. Slowly, he trailed it down my
body, between my drooping and wounded pectorals, over my arched ribcage, my
taut and red-scorched belly. I moaned as the flame passed my burned and seeping
navel, singeing the slight hair that leads my groin.

And then he
thrusted the lit candle between my legs.

There was a
hissing of sweat as the heat reached the tender skin of my ball sac. An instant
later, I began to wail, then shriek, then scream. My eyes bulged. My lungs
emptied themselves in a terrible screeching as Samir passed the flame up and
down, searing my shaved testicles and the bottom of my cock, holding it
directly under the flinching star of my anus. The soft hairs that surrounded my
balls smouldered and then burned away, the skin hissed, wisps of smoke curling
from between my thighs, and I shrieked and howled.

&quot;Oh fuck
no oh oh oh shit please stop aaaaaahhhhhhh!!!!&quot; My head thrashed from side
to side, my dark blond hair was pouring sweat. I was squealing and roaring with
pain as my delicate parts suffered the intimate agony of the candle-flame.

He shifted the
flame further back so that it fluttered and blistered my arsehole again; the
smell was a mix of burning skin and searing sweat, and my screams were demonic.

&quot;AAAAAHHHH!!!!
Stop-stop-stop I'll talk, I'll talk, I'll talk!!&quot; Samir removed the candle.
Smoke still drifted out from between my legs, and my pecs heaved, my eyes
rolling in disbelief at the agony that ravages me. &quot;Ohhhhh �&quot;

&quot;Tell me
where is he!&quot; Samir said.

I gave him the
address. 

Ahmed typed it
into a palmtop. He shook his head.

&quot;Tell the
truth!&quot; Samir shouted, and thrusted the candle again between my legs. I
clenched my teeth, but the flame licked my wounded sex and the pain returned,
even worse than before. My mouth opened in a terrible scream.

&quot;Ooooaaaahhhh!!!
I swear I swear I swear!!&quot; I shrieked. I was trying, despite the hideous tension
in my body, to buck my hips against the pain, but I could not escape it. Fresh
wisps of smoke and steam filtered up from my groin, and I yelled my agony
dementedly, but no admission.

Samir withdrew
the candle. He turned to Ahmed. &quot;Not because I believe him, but because a
stronger form of persuasion is required before he will tell the truth.&quot;

2.

Hours past.

I have been
secured on the wheel rack for almost four hours. In that time, my muscles have
completely failed me, my joints have loosened, my ligaments and tendons have
begun to swell and tear under the strain.

My tanned skin
was greasy with perspiration. My armpits were glistering with sweat, and the
aroma of stale sweat and fear betrayed my suffering. My nipples, burned and
blistered, still stood painfully in the air. The reddened and blistered path
down my solar plexus and abdomen was like a trail to the ugly, raw wound that
was the remnant of my once-pretty navel. 

Between my
upstretched arms, my head lolled against the iron-studded curve of the wheel
rack, on the pillow of my trapezius. My brows were creased with my suffering,
my eyelids heavy, eyes red-rimmed and cheeks streaked by tears. My mouth was
twisted in a constant grimace of anguish.

&quot;Save
yourself more needless suffering, boy&quot; Samir said. &quot;Tell me where you
have hidden your brother.&quot;

&quot;I haven't.
Our guardian arranged for him those foster parents!!! I DO NOT KNOW WHERE HE
IS!&quot; I cried.

&quot;Than what
is that address you gave?&quot;

&quot;That was
the last address I know!! Please...I don't know where he is. Please, when will
you believe me?&quot;

&quot;When you no
longer care if you live or die,&quot; he said. &quot;When you are ready to beg
for death, the truth will come easily from your lips.&quot;

&quot;No
Pleaseeeee!&quot; I shriek in horror.

&quot;Another
notch,&quot; he told Ahmed.

My arched body
was already stretched to its limit, the elasticity of sinew and ligaments
painfully tested. As the rack groaned and the big wheel turned, my wrists were
hauled another fraction of an inch from my anchored feet, and I stretched
further.

&quot;Aaaaaah!!&quot;
The agony
exploded through me. I gave a long scream of pain, unable to bear the torment. &quot;No
more!! It hurts - ohhh!!&quot;

&quot;This is
nothing,&quot; he promised me. &quot;Tell me what I need to know.&quot; I was
shrieking and gasping. &quot;Unlike the localized pain of the candle torture,
the rack delivers a horror that tears at your very bones, and will surely wrest
the truth from you.&quot; He added. I'm staring at the vaulted ceiling of the
torture chamber as I gave a long wail of agony and despair.

&quot;Another
notch,&quot; he said.

The rack groaned,
and I gave a shrill scream as the pain tore and ripped through my tormented
body. My stretching limbs were fiercely taut, muscles rigid, my ribcage stark
below my heavy pecs. The creaks and groans of my joints could be heard as they
were subjected to intolerable strain. My hands were curled into claws beyond
the wrist-shackles. Sweat was running down my sides. &quot;Stop! Oh stop,
please, stop!&quot;

&quot;Where is he
hiding? Tell me where!&quot;

&quot;I swear I
don't know!&quot;

&quot;Where is
you brother? Talk, you fucking idiot!&quot;

&quot; I don't
know! I don't know!&quot; I cried in a high voice.

&quot;Another
notch,&quot; he told Ahmed.

&quot;Please don't
stretch me!!&quot; I screeched, but Ahmed forced the winch, and I gave an awful scream as
my body stretched a fraction further. 

Those who have
suffered on the wheel rack know how tearing and all-engulfing its pain is.
Ultimately, I believed it to be even worse than burning alive, as every sinew
and fibre is distended but the nerves remain intact to feel every moment of it.

Samir stopped.
Gave me time to suffer. There was no urgency, and the pain would only worsen.
Stretched that tightly, I could not draw deep enough breaths to maintain my
screams, but I could not stay silent either. 

When ten long
minutes have passed, Master Samir gave Ahmed the order to turn the wheel again.
The heavy machine creaked, and my body stretched a little more. 

&quot;Oh God!!
My hips, my hips!! Aiieeee!!&quot; Suddenly I was slamming my head against the studded
wood of the rack, half mad with the pain that tore at my hips. It felt as if my
body was being slowly pulled apart - and it was. As I screamed and
howled in agony, the world began to fade, despite the serum.

I didn�t know how
much time passed.

&quot;Wash him
down.&quot;

The pail-full of
icy-cold water was flung over me. The icy impact shocked a scream from my
lungs, tearing me back to lucidity. As water coursed in rivulets over my
pectorials, trickling down the ravine of my belly, quivering droplets covering
my bare skin, goosebumps rose all over my naked body. My burnt nipples
tightened and stiffened, reddish stalks, the darkened aureole crinkling in
response to the cold.

As my eyes
cleared I saw that Samir sat on a chair in front of me. I also felt that the
rack had loosened a bit.

&quot;Rise and
shine.&quot; Samir smiled. &quot;Accept my greatest regard. You are far more
stronger than I imagined. Your master would be really proud. You have showed
your braveness. But still, I have to know where your brother is.&quot;

&quot;I told
you...&quot; I started but Samir was not finished.

&quot;Yes. You
lied. You can't believe how much I respect your fidelity. Nevertheless, you
have reached the edge of my tolerance. If you do not start to talk I will cause
such pain that will drive you mad. You think you have suffered and endured?
Yes?

I remained
silent.

&quot;Let me
introduce you this little tool.&quot; There was a metal gear in his hand. Two opposing, slightly-concave spoons which
could be clamped together with the turn of a handsomely engraved screw. In the
middle of each spoon were two spikes, about half an inch long.

&quot;My preference is always to
avoid such gross methods of torture. But you have left me no choice. It is
among the most psychologically distressing to a man, but seldom fatal, unlike
the pear.&quot; He regarded my limp cock, soft and vulnerable and the delicate
eggs of my balls hiding beneath.

With gentle fingers, he took one
warm, round orb between his fingers and thumb, and I jolted in surprise and
pain as he touched my burnt skin. When he closed the cold, heavy iron of the
first crusher over my ball and began to tighten the screw, I gave a whimper. I
was unable to struggle or writhe.

&quot;What � are you doing?&quot;

&quot;If you're so fucking tough, let's
see how you enjoy having the juice squeezed, little by little, out of your
lemons!&quot;

&quot;Oh God - nooooo!&quot;

He compressed the second crusher
onto my other ball and twisted the screw, just enough for the spikes to lightly
press on my testicle. I gave another wail of horror. &quot;Stop!&quot;

&quot;Not a chance,&quot; he said,
and twisted the screw. The cups closed, the spikes probed, and the pain leapt
from my squashing balls. My eyes bulged and I gave a shout.

&quot;No, dammit, no! Stop,
please, stop!&quot;

He looked up at me.

My face was twisted in horror and
nausea. Fresh sweat flooded my face. I was pale. My fingers clawed uselessly
beyond the manacles that held me stretched. I was trying to see down between my
legs, where the crushers hugged my testicles like iron clams. &quot;Oh god, please,
don't turn the screw!&quot; 

Samir gave a laugh of delight.
&quot;You mean - like this?&quot; He twisted the screw, and as the
spikes pushed cruelly on either side of my testicle, I gave a long shout of
terror.

&quot; Please, Master,
please, take them off!&quot;

He gently agitated the turnscrew of
one crusher, so that I could feel the spikes digging into the sides of my badly
burnt ball. 

He twisted the screw. The plates
compressed, and I jolted on the wheel rack, giving a new cry of pain. Samir
tightened the crusher again, then again. I gave another groan as my testicle
began to distort under the pressure. The rounded metal studs of the device
impressed themselves in the sensitive tissue

&quot;Say it!&quot; he urged, and
twisted the screw again.

I gave a howl as my balls are
squashed tighter. &quot;Oh god, take it off!!&quot;

He screwed it tighter.

I let out a long scream of pain,
jolting and thrashing, pumping my hips as if I'm simulating sex, trying to
shake the crusher loose; but I could hardly move. Samir twisted the screw once
again. My testicle was now squeezed to half its normal width, and I howled.

&quot;Still no confession?&quot;

I was still howling and twisting
from my back-wrenched arms with the crusher tight on my testicle. I threw up.
The pain from my testicles was expressed as nausea, and a watery spurt splashed
to the floor from my open mouth. The liquid flowed down from my over-taut body.

&quot;Give him two notches,
Ahmed.&quot;

At his instruction, Ahmed pulled
the lever. I gave the most terrible screams.

Samir reached up to the crushers
squeezing my testicles. None too gently, he tightened the looser of the two,
until it compressed my ball into an oblong. My screams were endless.

&quot;Do you think the crushers
need to be tighter ?&quot;

I howled and bucked in my bonds.
Another turn of the screw drove the spikes fully into my balls and the spoons
began to compress my testicle. I was howling like a wounded animal as Samir
again shook and twisted the crusher. 

Samir turned the
screw another full revolution and compressed my testicle into a mass about
three quarters of inch thick. A stream of pee flowed from my cock, my eyes
bulging from their sockets and my face dark red. Moans and gasps of agony were
the only sounds that came from my throat. He turned the device's screw again
causing me to bellow like a wounded bull, and then, with one final revolution,
brought the spoons of the device together. My nuts were now less than one half
inch. My body spasmed in my bonds as Samir shook and twisted the device.
�I let out one terrible cry and fainted
away from the pain.
