Synopsis: Amabelle's lover surprises her at the library before finals.






The sun came through the tall windows, flittering down between the book shelves and books softly, dancing with the dust motes that lingered in the air. It was pleasant here, at least for her; she readjusted her glasses and focused again on the text open before her. She could feel the headache growing inside her, it happened sometimes, she still wasn&#8217;t use to the glasses and the affect they had or didn&#8217;t have. She couldn&#8217;t read without them, not without asking for a headache and the current one was building because she had attempted just that. Bad idea apparently. 

Her lips parted in a yawn as she stretched in her chair, her plain white button up blouse straining over her generous bosom as her legs uncoiled from beneath the chair her sweetly curved bottom rested in. Spencer&#8217;s Fairy Queen was interesting, truly it was but today it was just not holding her mind, and the small text was blurring before her eyes, even with the glasses. She shook her head, her curls moving around her shoulders easily before resettling as she rested her chin in the cup of her palm and glanced around her at the bookshelves.

 She was all alone here too, just studying for something that wasn&#8217;t happening for two more weeks and everyone else had obliviously found better things to do. Perhaps she was too much of an over achiever. Suddenly the female felt hands on her shoulders, teasing her skin through the curtain of her hair, the heat of the hands going through her white linen blouse and plain gray vest. Her head turned, eyes widening before they took in the sight of him. �Oh..sir..� she turned in her seat, her hands reaching up towards him only to have his hands close around hers and pull her upward, out of her chair. She went, her gray skirt sliding around her long legs even as her kitten heels hit softly against the floor in clacks, she stumbled into his taller frame and blushed, smiling shyly up at him.

�How is my good girl?� She shivered slightly at the low chuckle in his voice, at the memory of when those words had last been spoken. Her lips parted, her tongue darting out to moisten them as she tried to find the words to speak. �Bored.� The truth came from her lips as she stood before him, her hands still imprisoned in his grasp. He tsked. 

�We can&#8217;t have that now can we?� She shook her head slowly, curious about why he was here. And how, oh how could her greatest wish have suddenly come true and he was here in the flesh before her, holding her against him. He had been so busy, so distant of late, and she had fallen back into her studies to try and ignore the fact that she seemed only a bother to him. His hands exerted a gentle pressure on her arms and she inhaled, her eyes looking up at him as memories entered her mind, her legs clenching together as she found herself suddenly weak limbed, her knees melting and her whole body betraying her by voicing a very vocal wish for him to touch her. 

He grinned, noting the difference in her bearing and turned the two of them so that her back was against the bookshelves, one hand remained on hers, keeping them together while the other ran down her body, a teasing caress that earned a soft whimper from her. She was wet and she knew it now, her body wanted him so badly, he had made certain it was so. His hand slipped under the hem of her short skirt and trailed upward toward the juncture between her legs, her lips parted this time in a moan as his fingers caressed her through the scanty material of her lace underwear. 

�Oh, what a good girl you are�� he murmured and she nodded wordlessly, backing with his steps so that her butt was up hard against the bookshelves, he urged her hands higher, resting them on the rails that ran on either side of the metal bookshelf. The cool metal against her heated flesh sent a shiver down her spine. "Keep your hands there babydoll..." His voice chuckled as she nodded shakily, her eyes half closed and yet fixed on him as his hands shaped her figure through her clothing, undoing the buttons of her gray vest. Her breathing strained the buttons of her white shirt though, her lips parted in the soft pants that was now her air. She felt her whole body tremble as he stood there, just looking at her, hardly touching her body, a whimper sounding from deeper within her throat, her body pulsated with her need, she needed him so badly she ached. 

"Please sir.." she begged softly, earning a gleam of heat from his eyes and another low chuckle, one of those special ones, deeper then normal that sent a rush of dampness through her body. She could feel her desire on her legs now, and she knew her panties were completely ruined. Her vest hung off her arms, his hands reached toward her and she almost sobbed in relief, only to have him hardly touch her, his fingers barely gazing her skin as he undid the tiny pearl buttons of her shirt. her clothing felt like too much, she wanted it gone, off her flushed skin. She began to lower her arms only to have him tsk, disapproving. "No, don't. Do as your told babydoll, now what is it?"

"Too much clothing..." she murmured, her cheeks coloring with a blush as she spoke. He smirked and came closer to her, his hands reaching up, bringing her arms down to slip off the vest, yet when it came to her white shirt he lifted her arms back up, folding her fingers around the railings. His hands went down, trailing along her limbs, then fisting the fabric of her shirt in his hands, pulling it taunt against her back. 

She stilled, watching him with eyes dark and slumberous heated. They both were silent, frozen there, eyes locked with heat arching between the two although now that her shirt hung open it revealed the creamy skin of her breasts covered only by a simple white bra. Then the sound of ripping fabric rent the air as his hands yanked the cloth apart. Her lips parted in a earthy gasp as she grasped tighter onto the metal beneath her hands, her body quivering slightly in response. Now he leaned close, his lips parting as he laid a kiss onto the pale column of her neck, brushing her curls out of the way, his nose inhaling the sweet scent of her hair. The kiss turned into a soft suction against her skin, then teeth scraped, grazed ever so slightly, she shivered against him, moaning softly, her eyes shut and skin flushed pink. Still he did not touch her with anything other then his mouth, and that a slow, languid, wandering touch, one minute sucking hard enough at some part of her smooth skin to color it a rosy red, the next just a simple chaste kiss pressed against her flesh. "Please please, oh sir....please" she whimpered the words, her need making her voice a earthy sound. His hands finally came to touch her sides, where her figure began to curve outward, steadying her as he chuckled.

"Very well little one." And with that his hands began their exploration of her skin. It was like he had no knowledge of anything about her, shaping each inch of her skin, touching everywhere, seeking out the places that made her wither against him in surprise reaction. His fingers came to her back, he pressed up closer to her front and she arched her body into him, trying to press herself into him, searching blindly for release. He undid the clips to her bra, then moving to the little clips in the front that would change the article into a strapless bra if need be. He made short work of those, and the bra dropped away, discarded on the floor to reveal the full pertness of her large breasts. The skin was translucent, so pale that her veins showed easily, except for the softly pink nipples, and the richer color of the hardened buds that jutted outward in her arousal. 

"So pretty�� his voice took on a tone of possessiveness, one that tightened her body further even though he stepped further away to examine her, his eyes running over all that he could see, taking in the trembling of her arms as she clenched the railings tight for support. He stepped forward, softly guiding her hands down, letting the ruins of her shirt fall to the ground to join her bra and vest, his body turned her again, guiding her back toward her desk, although his hands pushed her books out of the way, clearing the surface. She went as he directed, although she stumbled a time or two, unsteady in her kitten heels. His hands somehow made her skirt vanish, it snaked down her legs to pool around her feet. "Step out of it pet." He murmured and she did, his hands reached around her to cup her butt in his hands before he lifted her slightly, placing her sitting on the desk. She sat there, the sunlight falling over her pale figure, her curls a mused halo around her flushed cheeks, her eyes depths of molten green and bronze. 

Her lips parted and she softly licked her lips, wetting them as she started remembering herself, and reached to cover her nudity. He reached out and stopped her. "No." was all he said, and she surrendered to his order, nodding slowly. 

His hands went to his own shirt next, watching her with those brilliant eyes of his, slowly undoing the buttons, baring his skin to her eyes, which were fixed on him, she was now shameless as she sprawled on the table top near nude and watched him. Finally the shirt was open and with a casual shrug it was gone, on the floor, her eyes watched it descend only to travel back up his body. His hands moved down, touching on the top of his pants but then he chuckled. �Not yet.� She watched his actions with riveted eyes. She wanted him nude as she was, she craved to see his form but he had said not yet and so it would not happen yet.

He came closer, his hands coming up now, reaching out to devour her skin with his burning touch. His fingers stroked along her skin, the softness of it pleasing to him. Her spine bowed when his hands cupped the fullness of her breasts, the sensitive skin sending a hoarse cry flying from her lips. "..mas..ter...." she moaned for him, her legs parting as his legs angled to move between them. She whimpered in protest when his hands left her breasts, to dance down the rest of her skin, fondling her butt as well, urging her up, partly off the table so that her whole body was his plaything. She trembled against him, a thing gone aflame with desire. "Oh..sir, master please, please..." 

"Please what sweet? Tell me what you want, tell me how much you want me, how badly your little body needs me." he ended his statement with his hands slipping inside her panties, playing softly in the wetness of her juices. "Master...please, I need you, oh...I...I need you, inside me. My body needs you please, please please..." she nearly cried the last. He chuckled again, both hands going to her lace panties, ripping them swiftly just like he had her shirt. She cried out, the violent tearing of fabric so close to her sensitive flesh sending shudders down her spine. 

�Good girl, good pet.� Her eyes were large and excited as they fixed on him, as his hands went to his own pants, undoing the buttons, the material falling away to reveal the obvious tent of his arousal in his boxers. She licked her lips, her throat working as she stared at him, flushed and wet with excitement. He stepped into her legs again, and she tugged down his boxers without him even having to say a word, freeing his jutting length, and her eyes worshipped it. 

His hands kneaded her buttocks again, lifting her slightly off the table and then, in one sweet, perfect moment, he rammed into her, hard, commanding, his body possessing hers as she cried out for him, withering as the sweet fire infected her veins. His thrusts earned a litany of moans and whimpers from her, her body shivering, trembling as he impaled her again and again, until finally she broke, screaming, convulsing violently around his shaft as he buried himself and they came together.
