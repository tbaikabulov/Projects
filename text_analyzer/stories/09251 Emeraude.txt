Synopsis:     An all female space crew discovers a distant planet ripe for conquests and subjugation of its alien populace.






EMERAUDE

In a far off galaxy, with three orbiting moons, is the lush verdant planet of Emeraude, so much like Earth but isn't. It had vast oceans sprinkled with tropical islands and a few patches of temperate zones to the north and south poles.

The dominant of the species that populates this paradise like planet are the Puzlickis. They are grotesque looking dark colored genial creatures with thick leathery hides and powerful muscles with remarkable strength equivalent to five grown men. Though strong and powerful, they are shy and submissive creatures.

Puzlickis resemble hobbit-size men or human dwarves, with the tallest barely reaching four feet. They have powerful short legs matched with long forearms ending in powerful knuckles and move about much like huge hairless apes. But unlike earth bound simians, they can gallop and run as far as horses could. They can also rival monkeys with their speed and skill at climbing and clinging to trees and cliff sides. 

But their resemblance to humanoid or even apelike form ends there for unlike human hobbits Puzlicki's sport a concave shape head, curving inward from chin to forehead, chinky-slit eyelids, huge rat-like ears, stubby nostrils that barely protrude from the face and a huge mouth with enormous suction like lips that are about 10 times the size of humans. 

But the most intriguing physical feature of the Puzlickis are their huge elongated&nbsp; flexible tongues that could stretch to a full 24 inch in length with five times more manipulability than that of humans. Without teeth or fangs, these strange looking tongues are necessary for the Puzlicki's survival for they forage almost exclusively on liquid sap or honey produce by the Cuntshii, a big pinkish-red flower that blooms out of a bushy plant. The liquid sap treasured by the Puzlickis, has a pungent musky scent and a tad bit on the salty side that provides them all their energy needs. The Puzlicki&#8217;s unique tongue is perfectly suitable to reach deep into the core of the spiraling tube-like flower which can efficiently suckle its precious nectar.

The human discovery of Emeraude and the subsequent conquest of its Puzlicki populace begun in the earth year 2550 or about five years ago, by an armed scientific expedition led by young &amp; intrepid&nbsp; Astro-Explorer Capt. Aurora Fuchs and the all-female crew of the Starship SuperPuzzy.

These all female crew of six were the vanguard of Earth&#8217;s space exploration and colonization program, each of whom were carefully handpicked from the elite space commandos, chosen not only for their bravery and fighting prowess but also for their brilliant minds. Each of these ladies had PHD&#8217;s in space science, alien biology and advance engineering.

The six young women were highly equipped for the challenges of their new discovery beginning with their personal gear.

The technology that goes on their �clothing� alone is light years ahead compared to the spacesuits that the first astronauts used to wear in the 21st century. Instead of the bulky and constricting spacesuits, these girls had on an ultra-thin bio-nanotech skin suit. After centuries of technological innovations, there are hardly any challenges that would pose a threat to these women&#8217;s physical wellbeing. 

Controlled by artificial intelligence, the skin suits can quickly transform through molecular self-assembly at blazing speeds into any adaptive material and dimensions to meet any physical challenges. From stocking thin material, the skin suits can quickly transform into an effective armor of the hardest composite material that would stop and deflect a deadly projectile travelling at bullet speed, without the wearer even thinking about it. It can also shape itself into a transparent material that would be an effective cocoon to the harshest climactic or weather conditions. At its more mundane uses, the skin suits can be molded and shape to any shades of color &amp; hue, material and in whatever style &amp; design that a woman may fancy. Truly, there is hardly any need of for a separate set of wardrobe or closet, for a skin suit is all that a girl ever needs in this day and age.

Of course, like anything else, there is always a drawback. The skin suits vast array of capabilities can only be sustain for no more than 12 hours before requiring a full hour of recharging. At its idle state, the skin suit is reduce to its most basic form which resembles a nylon stocking mesh that tightly hugs its wearer. When not in active use, the skin suit resembles a two piece lingerie consisting of a restricting bra and a tiny high cut thong panties and only a pair of gloves and knee high boots that completes a space girl&#8217;s garb.

As accomplish soldiers, the need to conserve energy when absolutely needed compelled these female space commandos to switch off their skin suits to its idle state turning it on only when absolutely needed. More often than not, these women go about their daily routine looking more like erotic striptease dancers rather than warrior-scientist. Fortunately they have gotten so used to it that this near naked state of attire hardly bothered these young women at all.

In fact when the girls discovered that Emeraude&#8217;s atmosphere was an exact twin of earth&#8217;s own, they were so relieve and happy that they didn&#8217;t have to switch on their skin suits to an adaptive life support system mode that would have been constricting to them.

Strip down to their bare essentials, Captain Aurora Fuchs and her young female crew emerges from their space craft after making a smooth and uneventful touchdown. The conquest of Emeraude begins.
