THE JOB

Chapter 1

The Job Offer




Kim opened her email inbox to check if she had received any communication from Yang &amp; Archibald Lawyers. Sure enough, there it was! She tentatively hit the "Open" tab to scrutinize the email for fear that it was, as usual, an out-and-out note of rejection. This after all, was very much the normal routine for Kim, so she could handle it, and she was well prepared for it. 
To her surprise, it was not a rejection after all. Instead, it was a note of approval.

Dear Kimberly Jones, we are happy to let you know you have been accepted for the post of Personal Assistant to Miss Rich, managing director of Yang &amp; Archibald Law Firm. You should receive a follow-up confirmation letter in the mail within the next few days with additional details enclosed.
You are required to report to Miss Rich on 2nd November for instructions about your new job role. Please report promptly at 10am Monday morning to Miss Rich&#8217;s office.
We congratulate you upon your success.
Sincerely,
Toby Yang
James Archibald

Kim read through the email three times over. She couldn&#8217;t believe her sudden change in fortune. She&#8217;d been trying for months to find employment, but had failed at every attempt. Until now! 
Kim jumped up from her computer and rushed through to the living room
�Success!� she shouted.
�Success!� Ma, pa, I&#8217;ve been hired! They want me! They want to hire me! I&#8217;ve done it! They&#8217;ve offered me a job as personal assistant to the company&#8217;s managing director.�
�Ma, daddy, where are you?�
�Kim, calm down, dear. What&#8217;s the matter? What is it?� Kim&#8217;s mom asked as she appeared from the kitchen.
�Mommy, I got the job! I finally got a job offer. It&#8217;s that company I had an interview with about 2 weeks ago. Remember? The law firm based in London. Oh Mom, this is really amazing! I can&#8217;t wait to tell everyone. Mom, I&#8217;m so excited. It&#8217;s just amazing!�
�Kimmy, slow down. What? What&#8217;s this you&#8217;re saying? Yeah, the company in London. Of course I remember you had an interview there, and you did so well to get the interview. Now what are you telling me?�
�Mommy, listen. Sit� sit down. Best you just relax. I&#8217;ll tell you��
Kim&#8217;s mom let her daughter guide her to the settee. 
�Where&#8217;s dad anyhow? Not still at work, is he?� Kimmy asked.
�No, he came home a couple of hours ago. Just gone out to do a little shopping. He should be back in the next hour or so.�
Okay, that&#8217;s good. Just sit, please, mommy. Listen to me��
�The job I had an interview for, in London, about two weeks ago, right? Remember that, don&#8217;t you?�
Kim&#8217;s mother nodded. �Yes, as I just said. I do remember. But what about it, Kim?�
�Well, that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m trying to tell you, ma. You see, I� well, I received an email from the company. From the company owners, that is. And it said� it said� well, it said that I, Miss Kimberly Jones, am now officially an employee and should report to the managing director of Yang and Archibald Lawyers, London!�
�What?� Kim&#8217;s mother couldn&#8217;t quite take it all in. Her daughter had been struggling for months to find a job. Any job. Any simple job. But this. This was different. This was no simple job. This was a wonderful opportunity for her daughter to become a key employee to one of the largest law firms in the whole of the United Kingdom.
�Mommy, which part of what I just said did you not understand, tell me?�
�It&#8217;s just� You know. It&#8217;s well, it&#8217;s��
�It&#8217;s what?� Kim asked? �It&#8217;s impossible that your daughter, at the age of a mere 24 years old, can get such a fantastic opportunity in life? Is that what you are saying, mom?�
�No, no, not that Kimmy. It&#8217;s just that� that you&#8217;ve been trying so hard to get anything. Something. Anything at all. But yet� yet� you&#8217;ve, well� you&#8217;ve somehow managed to get, well, this job��
�Oh mommy, how could you say that? I always thought I could find a really good job, with a really top notch company. But yet, you&#8217;re saying you never really believed in me. How could you, mommy?�
�No, not that Kimmy, honey. It&#8217;s not that at all. I&#8217;m just saying that I&#8217;m, well� I&#8217;m absolutely delighted. I can&#8217;t really believe it, darling. Don&#8217;t get me wrong. I&#8217;m totally amazed. It&#8217;s fantastic news, it really is! I can&#8217;t wait to tell your father. He&#8217;s going to be over the moon. We&#8217;ll have a party. We&#8217;ll tell your grandma. Wait. I&#8217;ll phone her now. Wait��
�Mom, we don&#8217;t want no party. Not just yet, okay? I don&#8217;t mind you tellin&#8217; grandma and stuff. But no party. I mean, what if the job doesn&#8217;t kinda work out, you know? I may be a failure or something.� Kim looked a little deflated.
�Oh come on girl. Don&#8217;t think like that. It&#8217;s time for celebration, not time for commiseration. You&#8217;ve just been offered a fantastic job, and all you can think of is failing at the very first hurdle. Don&#8217;t you be thinking that, young lady. You will succeed. You will! You&#8217;re just like your dad, really. He&#8217;s worked hard all his life, and he has succeeded. Well, you know, not really in the same way that we would have hoped. But he&#8217;s still successful. Never been unemployed. Never. Always worked, since he was much younger than you are. And now it&#8217;s your turn. But Kimmy, your daddy will be so, so proud of you. You see, he&#8217;s always strived so hard to get to the higher, how to say, levels in his work. But even though he&#8217;s worked so hard, year after year, he failed. Every time, he failed. But here&#8217;s you. Just starting out, really, and already you&#8217;re a success, girl! That is� this is why I&#8217;m amazed, Kimmy. You&#8217;re a success already, where your father really has never ever been like that. See what I&#8217;m saying?�
�Yeah but mom, dad&#8217;s always been a good father, and a good husband. There&#8217;s more to success in life than having a good job. Isn&#8217;t there?�
�Certainly Kimmy. Certainly. He&#8217;s a great father and a wonderful husband. There&#8217;s no getting away from that. All it is though is that he&#8217;s never climbed up the ladder at work like he&#8217;d have wanted to. I mean, he&#8217;s never made management level. He always said he would. But he never ever did. And, for him, that makes him out to be a bit of a, well� a bit of a failure. He&#8217;s not a failure, not for me, not for you. But for him, he&#8217;s been a failure. And he&#8217;ll probably never have the chance to make up for that. He&#8217;s getting too old. But Kimmy, this is what it&#8217;s all about for your father now. He sees you as being the success that he never was, you see. He sees you as being what he always wanted to be. You&#8217;re his one hope. You&#8217;re his real hope. That&#8217;s why he&#8217;s paid all those tuition fees for years and years. And not once did he grumble about it. He just paid, even though it&#8217;s sometimes been a struggle for us to find enough money.�
�Oh mommy. Is this really true? Is it really? I never got it. I never knew that dad saw it this way. I&#8217;m so sorry. Really, I am. I&#8217;ve been such a burden for so long. And I never even realized it. But it&#8217;s okay, mom, I&#8217;ll make it up to him, and to you. You&#8217;ll see. This is just the start of it. You&#8217;ll both see. I can do it. I can be the best daughter to you both, ever. I&#8217;ll be great at this job. At any job. Any� This is just the beginning. It&#8217;s a stepping stone for me. But mom, it is a great beginning. Oh, I&#8217;m just so excited. I can&#8217;t believe it. I really can&#8217;t!�
�Okay, darling, let me call grandma, will you. She&#8217;ll be so, so happy. I best tell her to sit down before I give her the news. She&#8217;ll probably fall over if she&#8217;s standing.� 
Kim and her mom both laughed. 
Kim left her mother to call her grandma while she went back to her desktop to check the email once again. Firstly, she wanted to be sure that she was not dreaming. Secondly, she also wanted to note down the date and time when she was asked to report for work along with all the other details that she&#8217;d need. If she got those wrong, then that could be the end of this amazing opportunity. 
In the background, she could hear her mother talking with her grandma.
�Gran, please sit down. Are you sitting yet? I have some news for you. But please, first, make sure you are sitting�.�
Kimmy laughed to herself. Poor old grandma. But she&#8217;s gonna be so excited. I know it. She&#8217;ll probably do a jig around the kitchen table, knowing her.�
Kim re-read the email and sure enough, it was a letter of acceptance for personal assistant to the managing director, Miss Rich, of Yang &amp; Archibald Law Firm in London, Regent Street. She felt a shiver go down her spine. 
�What if� What if� What if I fail? What if Miss Rich doesn&#8217;t like me? What if the job is too difficult and I get booted out? What if the other employees hate me? Oh my, Kimmy,� she said to herself, �so many &#8216;what if&#8217;s&#8217;. Best you stop asking &#8216;what if&#8217; or you&#8217;ll talk your silly self out of the job before you even begin.�
Kimmy noted down the essentials. 
�Okay, so, Miss Rich, managing director. Geez, not that I&#8217;ll forget Miss Rich, of course! Got that. 189 to 191 Regent Street. Okay, got that too. 10am Monday the 2nd of November. Tick! What else? Hmmm� Well, what am I going to wear for the first day? Dark suit jacket. Short matching skirt. White blouse. Nothing overly clingy but a little sort of sexy, I guess, might be good. Yeah, that&#8217;s it. I&#8217;ve just the right outfit for it. Thankfully won&#8217;t have to buy nothing, at least for the first couple of weeks or so. Think I&#8217;ve got some decent sort of clothing to get me through the first couple of weeks and more. Okay, darling Kimmy, note it all down. Get it all down. No forgetting at the last moment what I&#8217;m about. Don&#8217;t wanna screw this up in any single possible way. This, my dearest Kimmy, is the chance of your life to shine through. The biggest chance you&#8217;ve had till now. Biggest chance by a long shot, darling, baby Kimmy, you total genius you!�
�Kimmy! Grandma says she&#8217;s ecstatic about your success. Says you&#8217;re such a smart girl. She&#8217;s so, so proud of you. Says she&#8217;s gonna dance in the street and party all night�� Kim&#8217;s mother shouted from the living room.
�Hahahaha! Tell her she&#8217;s nuts, mom, will ya!�
�Okay honey, I will� She&#8217;ll not care what you say. She&#8217;s in such a good mood now. Think she&#8217;ll probably get on the brandy this evening too.�
Kim got back to her note taking. 
�Right,� she said to herself, �what about Miss Rich? What do I know about her? How can I impress her from the first day, I wonder? Okay, let&#8217;s say that she&#8217;s very clean cut. No messing with her. No jokin&#8217; around. She doesn&#8217;t smile much, if I remember correctly. She&#8217;s total business and not much else. She&#8217;s scary, yeah, she&#8217;s scary. She&#8217;s well, she&#8217;s very sexy. I did notice that about her. She&#8217;s a control freak. Nothing at all out of place with her. She&#8217;s demanding. No, she&#8217;s domineering. I noticed how she had that whole establishment under her control. She&#8217;s the sort of woman who would only need to look at you and you&#8217;d squirm. She&#8217;s cool. She&#8217;s calculating. She&#8217;s nobody&#8217;s fool, so to speak. And, I wonder if she&#8217;s single? I suspect she makes no time for relationships. She&#8217;s so devoted to her work. She&#8217;s a machine. Yeah, that&#8217;s it, a machine. So, that all said, little Ms Kimmy girl, how you gonna get in her good books from day number uno. And how you gonna keep in her good books as the days turn to weeks, then to months? I mean, Kimmy, she&#8217;s your boss. She&#8217;s the one that holds your reins. You step out of line with this lady, and you could end up as history for Yang and Archibald&#8217;s London-based law firm. Bye bye silly billy Kimmy girl, you just kissed goodbye to perhaps the very best opportunity you&#8217;ll ever get in this life of yours.�
Kim pondered the scenario. �But what if she doesn&#8217;t like you? What if you don&#8217;t get along together? What if she makes your working life into some sort of hell-hole? What if� what if she&#8217;s really a lesbian and she wants to control your every move?�
Kimmy laughed. 
�That would be different! Yeah, that&#8217;s it. Miss Rich is a lesbian. Her real name, or rather, the name she gets at work from the other staff is &#8216;Miss Rich the Lesbo Bitch!&#8217; 
Kim giggled at the idea of it. 
�And Miss Rich the Lesbo Bitch is now your immediate boss, Kimmy girl. Aren&#8217;t you the the lucky one, huh? Your first real sort of job in life and you end up being a lesbo&#8217;s bitch girl. She beats you when she feels she wants to. She gets you to do, erm� kinda things that you never even dreamed about. She controls your every move, even when you&#8217;re not at work. In fact, she demands that you stay after working hours every day, and she also demands that you report to her residence at the weekends. Well, if that&#8217;s what it takes, Kimmy girl� if that&#8217;s what it takes to succeed, where your ma and pa have failed, then that, my dear, is what it will take!�
Kim promised there and then that no matter her circumstances with her future boss, she would succeed. No matter what. She was going to be a winner from now on in, and that was that. She didn&#8217;t care about hardship. Didn&#8217;t care about anything else. She just wanted to be a winner. To make her parents and her grandma and her friends, and everyone else too, so, so proud of her. She was a winner, and that was that!
�Kimmy, that&#8217;s your dad back. Think it best you come tell him the news yourself�� Kim heard her mom shout through.
�Okay mom, I&#8217;m just finishing up here. Give me a min, will ya��
Kimmy finished her note taking and headed back to the living room. 
�Hey daddy, what&#8217;s up, dude?�
�Kimmy, what&#8217;s this then? Since when was I a &#8216;dude&#8217;?� her father laughed. 
�You is one cool dude, man, is what it is�� Kim continued to joke with her father.
�I is a cool dude all of a sudden, is I? And so, what&#8217;s the occasion? Why is it that I is one cool dude now, when before, I ain&#8217;t been no cool dude?�
�Oh Kimmy, stop it!� Kim&#8217;s mom scolded. �Tell your father. Stop playing silly games with him, for goodness sake!�
�Sorry momz but I is in some good mood, see it? Okay dude,� Kim turned her attention back to her father, �you is to sit down now and you just be quiet for a minute or is it two, like��
�Kim, what are you talking about?� her father asked, with a perplexed look on his face. �You been on drugs or something, girl? You know, I always told you that drugs are bad. You should never ever be tempted by drugs. They can mess up your whole life. I&#8217;m telling you, young lady. If you&#8217;re on drugs, you&#8217;re in some serious, serious trouble. Now what&#8217;s going on here?� Kim&#8217;s father looked stern.
�Okay pops, you got it!� Kim smiled broadly. �Listen up, pops. You gonna be pumped when I tell its to ya!�
�Kimmy, stop. Stop this. I&#8217;m telling you, if you don&#8217;t stop, I&#8217;m going to��
�Daddy, cool off. I&#8217;m just playing with you.�
�Kim, stop teasing your father.� Kim&#8217;s mother chastised. �Just tell him. Stop making silly games.�
�I can&#8217;t help it mom. Okay. Dad. Relax. Sit back. Have a glass of wine or something. Hey, why not go out and buy some really nice wine for a change? It will be on me. Just put it on my tab. It&#8217;s fine. You and mom deserve it.�
Kim&#8217;s father looked at his wife. �What&#8217;s going on here? What&#8217;s going on Marjory?�
�It&#8217;s okay Henry. Do as she asks and sit back and relax. Kim&#8217;s got something to tell you. Kimmy,� Kim&#8217;s mother directed her attention to her daughter, �can you please just tell your father, please. He&#8217;s going to have a heart attack or something if you keep on with this silly nonsense. Please��
�Alright mom, just chill, will ya,� Kim smiled at her mother.
�Right dad, sitting comfortably, are we? Ready to hear the good news? Ready to go get some fine wine, the special sort that you and mom always want but never can afford, are you? Ready, daddy?�
�Yes, girl, please, just get on with it. As your mother says, you&#8217;re about to give me a heart attack. You&#8217;re not on drugs, are you, Kimmy? Please, tell me, you&#8217;re not doing drugs, please��
�Daddy, don&#8217;t be so silly. I&#8217;m not doing drugs, and I&#8217;ll not ever do drugs. Sure, weekenders out on the town with the girls is all it&#8217;s about. But we never, none of us, ever do drugs. So please, stop being so silly.�
�Sooooo� what is it then? Why are you acting so strange, girl?�
�I got a job, daddy!� Kim exclaimed.
�You got a job? Well, that&#8217;s terrific! Congratulations my girl! I told you. I told you. You just needed to keep on trying. I told you. You&#8217;ve got a really good education. I knew it would happen. You just needed to believe it. That&#8217;s marvelous Kimmy. I&#8217;m so, so proud of you, really, I am. And mommy is too, aren&#8217;t you mom?�
�Yes, darling, I am very proud of our daughter. Very proud indeed. But wait, there&#8217;s more, Henry. Let Kim continue, please.�
�More what?� Kim&#8217;s father looked mystified. �More? More what?�
�Daddy�� Kim smiled broadly, �I&#8217;ve been hired as the personal assistant to the managing director at Yang and Archibald&#8217;s Law Firm in London. And daddy, that&#8217;s one of the largest law firms in the whole of the UK! So what do you think about it all now? You still think I&#8217;m doing drugs, do you?�
�Kimmy, darling. You know that I love you, and I will always love you. But please, it&#8217;s time to stop with this. Tell me the truth. What&#8217;s the real job you got? Are you going to be working as a secretary for a local firm here in Rugby? Maybe in Northampton or something? Stop playing around. Mother, what&#8217;s this? I can&#8217;t get this girl to be serious just for one moment? What&#8217;s going on here? Mother, are you in on this too? I&#8217;m warning you both, stop playing with me or I&#8217;ll� I&#8217;ll� I&#8217;ll do� something��
Kim and her mother laughed. �You&#8217;ll do what Henry?� Kim&#8217;s mother asked. �You&#8217;ll do just what? Perhaps you can go over to AP Harvey and get a couple of bottles of that Shiraz you&#8217;re always on about, but you don&#8217;t ever buy cos you can&#8217;t afford it. Hey, that&#8217;s a good idea, what d&#8217;you think Kim?� 
Kim nodded her approval. �And the bill&#8217;s on me!�
�Stop, I mean it, stop it!� Kim&#8217;s father demanded. �Now Kimmy, it&#8217;s great that you&#8217;ve got a job an&#8217; all. I&#8217;m really, really proud and happy about this. Truly, I am, really� But, you know� being a secretary in a local firm is not going to make you into a millionaire, girl. Now, sure, I know this is your first real wage, and that, but, Kimmy, you&#8217;ve got to save your money. Don&#8217;t you go splashing it about like you&#8217;re earning big time. It ain&#8217;t happenin&#8217; my girl. That ain&#8217;t happenin&#8217;. So just you take it easy on the purse strings. Now don&#8217;t you be getting me wrong here darling. I&#8217;m really, really proud of you. I totally am. I mean it too. But just, well� just take it easy with things, okay? Are we agreed on that, honey?� Kim&#8217;s father reached out and took her hand.
Kim held her father&#8217;s hand tightly. �Daddy, I mean it. We mean it. It&#8217;s time to celebrate. As mom says, please, go to get the wine. In fact, no, no. Let&#8217;s go out, all of us. Let&#8217;s go. What do you fancy? Mom, dad? What do you feel like eating tonight? Let&#8217;s celebrate. Com&#8217; on. Let&#8217;s�� Kim looked at both of her parents, hoping that they would both agree to her proposition.
�Kimmy, you know that me and your mom can&#8217;t afford to do that,� her father replied. �You know how things are. And quite honestly, I&#8217;m not going to rely on my own daughter to treat me. It&#8217;s just not fair. As I said, Kimmy, I&#8217;m absolutely delighted that you got the job. It seriously is really great news. And I do think we need to celebrate this occasion, and we will. But please, I� we� cannot possibly afford to go out and dine in some fancified restaurant. Please, you have to understand that. Please.� Kim&#8217;s father looked pleadingly into her eyes.
�Oh for God&#8217;s sake Henry!� Kim&#8217;s mother piped up. �Let the girl do what she wants to do. She&#8217;s not asking you to pay. She&#8217;s offering to pay for us! Look, Henry� it&#8217;s her way of saying thanks to you that you&#8217;ve supported her education over all these years. And she&#8217;s done you proud too. She&#8217;s got her degree. She&#8217;s worked really hard. And now, she wants to say thanks. It&#8217;s really simple, really. Now please, let her do as she sees fit. And Henry, your daughter is not joking. She is, in fact, going to be the personal assistant to the managing director at Yang and Archibald. Remember, I told you? The law firm in London? Remember? She went for that interview about two weeks back? Remember that?�
Kim&#8217;s father nodded.
�Well, good that you remember. She got the job, Henry. Don&#8217;t you understand that?�
Henry looked back and forth between his daughter and his wife.
�No. Can&#8217;t be. No. Are you joking me? Are you just playing around. Please. It&#8217;s not fun any longer. I mean it.�
�Henry, please,� his wife smiled. �I&#8217;m really getting tired of your lack of trust. It is entirely true. Your daughter has gained an offer for employment at one of the most prestigious law firms in this entire country. And not only that, she will be answering directly to the managing director. It&#8217;s true, I promise you, it&#8217;s true! We both promise you. It&#8217;s entirely true, Henry!�
Kim&#8217;s father looked down at the floor. �I� You� You mean� You mean our Kimmy got &#8216;that&#8217; job? Are you sure? She got &#8216;that&#8217; job?�
�Daddy, what did mom just tell you? Yes, I got the job. I got the job dad. Now, go, get dressed into something nice. You and mom. Put on your best. Let&#8217;s go out. Let&#8217;s celebrate this wonderful occasion. And daddy,� Kimmy smiled at her father. �Dad� it&#8217;s my treat to you and to mom, okay?�
Kim&#8217;s father looked into his daughter&#8217;s eyes. �Oh Kimberly, I&#8217;m totally overwhelmed! I just� I�� He rose from his seat and hugged her tightly, trying hard not to show too much emotion.
�It&#8217;s okay dad,� Kim hugged him back, �it&#8217;s okay� I understand.�







Chapter 2

The Beginning




Kim woke early on Monday, 2nd of November. She checked her clock. 5.24 am. Too early to get up, really, but she decided to make some final preparations. The pressure was on. She had to make a good impression on her first day at work. 
She switched on her light and went to look in the mirror. Her blonde curls embraced her shoulders. Her dark brown eyes were glazed from lack of sleep. She pushed out her chest. �Hmmm� yeah, not at all bad, darling,� she said to herself. Her breasts were large and pert. One of her most attractive features, and she knew it.
�Right, honey, best you start to do your makeup. Never too early to start on that,� she said to herself. 
�Darling, you up?� Kim&#8217;s mother knocked lightly on her bedroom door.
�Yeah, mom. What are you doing up so early?�
�I couldn&#8217;t sleep well last night. Feeling too nervous and excited, see��
�Yes, me too mom. Couldn&#8217;t sleep much either.�
�Want a cup of coffee, Kim?�
�Yeah, that would be great, thanks mom.�
Kim&#8217;s mother returned 10 minutes later with her coffee.
�Well, darling, no matter how it goes today, you know that your father and I will always support you. I mean, even if you don&#8217;t get on too well, or whatever, we still love you and we will always be on your side.�
�Mother,� Kim replied sternly, �what are you saying? Of course I&#8217;ll get on well. How could they not like me? I mean, I&#8217;m so pretty and sexy. Everyone likes me.� Kim laughed. Her mother smiled.
�Yes, I know darling. But simply because you are pretty and sexy does not mean that everyone will like you. Particularly when you have such an important job to do. You see, folks get mean. They get jealous. Back stabbing and all that sort of thing. Just you be careful. Make friends wisely. Don&#8217;t get attracted by the office gossip. That can pull you down faster than anything. Just choose your friends wisely.�
�It&#8217;s okay mom, I might be young, but I&#8217;m not totally na�ve about life.�
�What time you leaving? You want dad to drive you?� Kim&#8217;s mother asked. �He&#8217;s decided to take the day off work today.�
�I&#8217;ll leave about 7 I think. It&#8217;s early, I know but I want to arrive early just to make a good impression. And no. Dad&#8217;s busy with other things. I&#8217;ll take the train, mom. Driving in London is a total nightmare so best I take the train. Then I&#8217;ll jump on a tube.�
�Okay baby. Remember to take your phone and give us a call when you can. Just keep us updated on how it&#8217;s going, okay?�
�Yes, sure mom. No worries.�
�I&#8217;ll let you get on, darling.�
�Thanks mom.�
Kimberly dressed in her finest office wear, donned her makeup carefully, and checked her look in the mirror. �Hmmm� yeah, to die for! You look really good, darling, really sexy,� she thought to herself. �No doubt all the guys at work will want you. Possibly Miss Rich too,� she laughed.
She checked her watch. �God, 6.50 already. I best get going.�
She snatched up her fake Louis Vuitton handbag and headed towards the dining room. �Mornin&#8217; daddy.�
Her father got up from the dining table and kissed her on the cheek. �Morning, honey. How you feeling? Nervous? You&#8217;ve got some day ahead of you, so you have. But don&#8217;t worry, it will all go perfectly, I&#8217;m sure.� He resumed his place at the table and continued to munch on his cornflakes.
�Yeah, a bit nervous dad. Normal though, isn&#8217;t it? As you say, big day ahead, and I don&#8217;t want to disappoint.�
Kim&#8217;s mother entered the dining room carrying a rack of toasted bread and a tea pot. �Darling, you do look ravishing. Don&#8217;t you think that&#8217;s just a little too daring for work though?� She rested the toast in the center of the table and the teapot on a mat beside her husband.
�Mom, don&#8217;t worry. I just want to make a good first impression. It&#8217;ll be fine.�
�Honey, have some toast before you go. Don&#8217;t want you getting hungry.�
�No mother. I&#8217;m not really good for anything. The belly&#8217;s grumbling a bit with the nerves. If I do get hungry, I&#8217;ll buy something on the train or when I get to London.�
�Okay darling. I know how you must be feeling. Now, have you got everything? Give us a call when you can, okay? Want dad to take you to the station?�
�Yeah, I got everything mom. And no, no need. I really do need to get some exercise. I&#8217;ll walk to the station. Just takes me 10 minutes or so.�
Kim kissed her mother on the cheek.
Her father rose from the table once more and hugged her tightly. �Good luck my girl. You show them what you got. You&#8217;ll do great. I&#8217;m very confident.�
�Thanks daddy. Don&#8217;t worry, I&#8217;ll be just fine.�
Kim walked to the front door. Her mother opened it. They embraced. �Take care Kimmy, we both love you very much and are so proud of you.�
�Oh, mom, if I&#8217;m not back later this evening, don&#8217;t worry. I&#8217;ll just get a cheap hotel room for the night. I&#8217;ll let you know a bit later on today, okay?�
�Okay darling. Do let us know though. Don&#8217;t forget.�
Kim waved to her parents as she left for the train station.




********



Kimberly arrived at Yang and Archibald Lawyers on Regent Street, London promptly. She checked her watch just before she entered the office.
�9.45. Good. Perfect timing.�
She then checked her outfit, hoping that there were no creases after the train ride.
�Right, darling,� she said to herself, �this is it. This is your big chance. It&#8217;s time to shine and to prove to the world that you are a real winner. You&#8217;ve come this far, Kimmy baby, so no turning back now. Let&#8217;s go get &#8216;em!�
Kim approached the reception.
�Hello ma&#8217;am, how may I help?� the receptionist looked up.
�Hi, my name&#8217;s Kimmy Jones. I&#8217;m here to start work as personal assistant to Miss Rich.�
�Oh yes,� the lady smiled broadly. �So you&#8217;re the new girl. Congrats on getting the job. I hope you really like it here.�
�Thanks,� Kim replied. �Emmm� what&#8217;s your name?�
�I&#8217;m Sammy, and it&#8217;s good to meet you. Did you find your way here okay?�
�Hi Sammy, same for me, nice to meet you too. Yes, I got here without any problems, thanks for asking.�
�Okay dear. Just jump into the elevator there,� Sammy pointed towards the lift, �and go up to floor 9. That&#8217;s where Miss Rich&#8217;s office is located.�
�Thanks Sammy. Do please wish me luck,� Kimmy smiled.
�Yes, I wish you the best of luck darling. You take it easy. You&#8217;ll get on just fine, I&#8217;m sure.�
Kimmy made her way to the elevator. �That&#8217;s a good start,� she thought to herself. �Let&#8217;s hope that everyone here is as nice as Sammy is.�
She strode into the elevator and pushed the button for floor 9. She checked herself over one more time. �Looking good girl, looking good.�
The elevator rode up and stopped. The doors opened. Kim got out, and approached the girl located behind the reception desk on floor 9.
�Hi, I&#8217;m here to start working with Miss Rich,� she said to the lady.
�Yes, indeed. Welcome to Yang and Archibald. Kim, isn&#8217;t it?�
�Yeah. It&#8217;s Kim.�
�Hi Kim. Just go over and knock on Miss Rich&#8217;s door. She&#8217;s probably on a call right now, but it&#8217;s okay. Oh, and congratulations on the new job. You beat out about 200 other applicants, so you must be pretty darn good.�
�Wow, really?� Kim smiled in astonishment. �I dunno. I just came to the interview and hoped that I would make some sort of impression. Seems that I surely did.� She smiled.
�Yes, you surely did. I&#8217;m Nina by the way.�
Kim reached over the desk to shake hands. �It&#8217;s good to meet you Nina.�
�Now, go on. Miss Rich is expecting you. Good that you arrived a little early. She really does like promptness and a certain level of punctuality.�
�Sure Nina. Thanks. Good to meet you.�
Kim made her way to Miss Rich&#8217;s office. She knocked lightly on the door.
�Come!�
Kim entered.
�Ah, Miss Jones. It&#8217;s so good to see you. How was your traveling?�
�Hello Miss Rich. Thanks. Good to be here, and thank you so much for giving me the job. Hmmm� I got the train and then the tube. Took a couple of hours or so.�
�Oh, you are more than welcome, darling. Come, please, sit.� Miss Rich beckoned Kim to sit in front of a huge walnut office desk. �Two hours, huh? That&#8217;s so much time. I hope you are going to look into relocating to London, my dear. I would not expect you to travel 4 hours each day. It&#8217;s best we find you accommodation here instead. I&#8217;ll have Nina look into that for us.�
Kimberly placed her handbag by her feet. �That&#8217;s really kind of you Miss Rich, but I don&#8217;t know I can afford it. I mean, the salary is great and all, but I want to save some money. Want to help my parents, you know how it is.�
�Please, Kimberly, I want none of it. That&#8217;s nonsense. Don&#8217;t you worry about the cost of renting. I&#8217;ll take care of that. That&#8217;s part of the remuneration package, see? And sorry, but was there no mention of that in the welcome letter? You get a monthly stipend to cover your rental costs.�
�Oh my, that&#8217;s wonderful, Miss Rich. That&#8217;s totally amazing! Thank you! And no, no mention of it. Never mind though, I know now.�
�Someone&#8217;s not been doing their job right. I&#8217;ll be sure to find out who. Anyways, it&#8217;s my pleasure, Kimberly. And, may I say, there&#8217;s more where that comes from too. If you &#8216;perform&#8217; well for me, you will be entitled to certain other, how to say� advantages� perks� privileges, while you remain at Yang and Archibald.�
�Oh really, Miss Rich? That&#8217;s so great. Well, I hope to do the best that I possibly can. I&#8217;m so ready to learn everything I can so I can be of great service to you and to the company.�
�Yes, darling. I know it too. This is why I decided to hire you. You &#8216;stuck out&#8217; among all the candidates. I could tell you are very enthusiastic. We interviewed so many girls, some with lots of experience too. But no. It was you I wanted. Now please, do make yourself comfortable. You can hang your jacket over there.� Miss Rich motioned towards a coat stand in the corner of her expansive office.
The phone rang. 
�Miss Rich!�
�Okay, that&#8217;s fine. Call me back later please. I&#8217;m a little busy right now. Give me about an hour. In fact, call me on the mobile. Okay. Bye.�
Kim removed her jacket and hung it on the coat stand.
Miss Rich stared at her as she made her way back to her seat.
�Yes, darling, I think we&#8217;ll get along just perfectly, you and me,� Miss Rich smiled. �Really, you are so very pretty. So sexy. You&#8217;re 23, is that right?�
�No, Miss Rich. I&#8217;ve just turned 24, actually.�
�Hmmm� I do like my girls young. So beautiful too. So sexy. 24 is simply ideal.�
Miss Rich smiled at Kimberly. Kim smiled back.
�Thanks Miss Rich. Erm� you are also very� well, you know� beautiful.�
�Darling, you are too kind,� Miss Rich beamed. �Now, where do we begin? I tell you. I have so much work to do. But now I have you, I&#8217;m sure we&#8217;ll manage just fine and dandy.�
Kim couldn&#8217;t help but notice Miss Rich&#8217;s bra. Her blouse was open just a little too much. Her cleavage was impressive, even to Kim, who considered her own cleavage to be rather outstanding.
Miss Rich stared at Kim once more. �Hmmm� yes, so beautiful. Yes, the perfect girl for the job.�
�Miss Rich?� Kim asked.
�Yes, young lady? Excuse me. I find you very attractive. Very. But let&#8217;s move on, shall we. Your desk is over there, Kim.� Miss Rich motioned towards a large oak desk in the corner of her office. �I&#8217;ve provided you with a desktop and a laptop, as well as a mobile. All of them are the latest models, of course. There&#8217;s no skimping on funds at Yang and Archibald, Kim. Only the best will do here. Plus. I will provide you with a monthly income to purchase new office wear. I always look for my girls to be appropriately dressed. Thusly, you will receive a further 800 pounds each month on top of your basic salary and that, my darling, is to cover at least some of the expenses for clothing.�
�Thank you Miss Rich. That&#8217;s really so kind of you. Thank you.�
�However, Kim, I do have some conditions. You will purchase exactly what I tell you. You will not, and I repeat NOT purchase anything that is not appropriate and to my liking. Is that clear, Kimberly?�
Kim nodded. �Yes, of course, Miss Rich.�
�Good. Now, there&#8217;s a list of items I would want you to wear, and I&#8217;ve placed that list on your desk. Tomorrow, you� we� yes, we� will go out and begin to invest in at least some of those items. For now, you are fine as you are. Just fine. Tomorrow, I will provide you with 800 pounds in advance, and you will come with me and we&#8217;ll do a little shopping. Please report for duty at 8 am. I like my girls to be nicely dressed and it is imperative, Kim, that you are too. Do I make myself clear?�
�Well, yes, Miss Rich. Of course. Thank you very much. I look forward to it.� 
Kim was a little confused by Miss Rich&#8217;s desire to invest so much money in her office wear. And not only that, but to personally accompany her to shop together. �I guess that comes with the territory,� she considered. Nevertheless, she was happy that she herself would not have to spend her own income on clothing. Or at least not much of it. And she was glad to have the company.
�Right, good! We&#8217;re off to a great start! Further��
Kim straightened herself in her chair.
�You will be expected to accompany me on business meetings. Often, those meetings are in the evening, for which, you will be compensated for your time. Clear?�
Kim nodded. �Yes, Miss Rich.�
�Good. You don&#8217;t have any boyfriends or other commitments, do you Kimberly?�
�No. Nothing, Miss Rich. I mean, no, not here anyhow.�
�Good. Perfect. From now on you will be spending a lot of time with me. Boyfriends are certainly not welcome for our female staff here at Yang and Archibald. My staff have little time for such inadequacies as boyfriends. Do I make myself clear?�
�Yes, of course, Miss Rich.� Kim already had the feeling that this job was not merely a job. It was more of a lifestyle. Nevertheless, she had to succeed, no matter what. She&#8217;d made up her mind that she was going to succeed, and that is precisely what she was going to do.
�Okay, good we understand one another on this matter. Now please, go over to your desk. There&#8217;s a lot of work that needs to be completed. I&#8217;ve created an email address for you, and you will find details of that written down beside your desktop. Please login and begin working through the messages. If you have any problems, do let me know. Clear?�
Kim nodded. �Yes, Miss Rich.�
�Off you go then girl. Work to be done.�
Kim took hold of her handbag and jumped up from her seat and stood to attention. Suddenly she felt like a private in the army &#8211; at the beck and call of her superior. �Yes Ma&#8217;am!� She quickly made her way over to her desk and popped her handbag underneath. She booted up the computer.
�Kimberly,� Miss Rich said, �any problems, let me know about them. I don&#8217;t want you sitting struggling with things. That is not time well invested. You will tell me if you have any issues, no matter what they are. Is that clear?�
�Emmm� yes, of course, Miss Rich. Sure. I understand. Thank you.�
�Okay, good girl. You and I will get along so perfectly. I can tell it. You&#8217;re so pretty. Sexy. I can tell we will get along really good.�
Kimberly smiled politely. �What?� she thought to herself. �Pretty and sexy? How does that make me a good fit for this job? I dunno. Strange. Seems strange.�
Kim clicked a few buttons on her keyboard. She read through the instructions that Miss Rich had left, noting the details of the email address and logins. �Okay, so here we go, Kim. It&#8217;s all or nothing. Great job. Great perks. Great everything. You&#8217;ve gotta succeed. It&#8217;s all or it&#8217;s nothing, girl.�
Kim logged into her new email account. �Geez, there&#8217;s like 100 messages in here already. Where do I start out?� she thought to herself. 
She scrolled down to the bottom of the email account and clicked. �Hi, darling. Had a good time last night. Hope we can do the same again soon. Please, do win my case for me. As we discussed, I&#8217;m looking for a 3 million pound settlement. If you win, your company will earn nicely. Further, honey, I will see to it that you personally gain from this. Well, you know what I mean. You take care, darling. Love you� Lorraine Marsh.�
Kim surmised as to her reply. This was not what she was expecting at all. So informal. So familiar. So familiar with the managing director of one of the largest law firms in the country. �Dear Miss Marsh,� she typed. �Thank you kindly for your email. Rest assured that we will win this case for you. It&#8217;s very much in all our interests to do so. I&#8217;m replying to you on behalf of Miss Rich. My name is Kimberly Jones, Miss Rich&#8217;s personal assistant. I&#8217;m positive that Miss Rich can meet you again soon and celebrate your success &#8211; our success. Kindest regards and sincerity. Kimberly Jones.�
�Hmmm, not exactly the most professional way to reply to an email, but given the circumstances, perhaps it is appropriate,� she thought.
Next email�
�Hi babes, been a bit of a time since I last talked with you. Hey, sorry about that. Can we catch up some time soon maybe? You know how to get in touch. Oh, and that house that you helped me with. Well, I just had it evaluated again. You know what? It&#8217;s now worth almost 5 million. I mean, shit, you done good girl. You done so good! Remember, I bought the place for only 2 mills. So in 3 years, it&#8217;s more than doubled my investment. So, gotta ask ya� when you free for dinner? I&#8217;m going to treat you to something special. Let me know honey, will you? You got my number. Jillian MacDonald.�
�Oh my god,� Kimberly said.
�Something the matter, Kimberly?� Miss Rich looked over.
�N� no, sorry� sorry Miss Rich. I� I just was reading through the emails in my account.�
�Yeah well, many of them are personal to me. In which case, simply forward them. I&#8217;ve written my email on the notepad there on your desk. Just forward those ones to me and I&#8217;ll take care of them.�
�Yes, of course Miss Rich. But, I did reply to one of them.�
�Oh, okay. Who was that from?�
�Emmm� a lady called Miss Marsh. Miss Lorraine Marsh.�
�Okay, that&#8217;s fine. And what did Lorraine say?�
�Well, she said that if we win her case, she&#8217;ll settle up with you.�
�Yes, I bet she will too,� Miss Rich replied. �It&#8217;s a 3 million case. Greedy bitch so she is. But hey, Kim, if we win, we get to fill the coffers. And heck, I get to fill my own pockets too. Plus other things besides. You know how women are��
�Well, yeah, sure, Miss Rich. It&#8217;s such a huge amount of money though.�
�3 mill is small fry to some of our clients, Kimmy� Miss Rich said dismissively. �What else you got there?�
�I read an email from a Miss Jillian MacDonald. She says she&#8217;s very happy with her investment in a property you advised her about. She&#8217;s made a very good profit from it already.�
�Sure thing. I knew she would. Have you replied?�
�Not yet, Miss Rich.�
�Okay, so please do so. Did she want anything?�
�Yes, she asked if you could meet together soon.�
�You can tell her that I can meet her�.hmmm� tomorrow night, let&#8217;s say. 8 pm. At Nagoya Sushi. You like Japanese food?�
�Never tried it, Miss Rich.�
�Okay, so now&#8217;s the time to try. You&#8217;ll like Jillian. She&#8217;s a hoot. Also, she&#8217;s loaded. Got so much money it would make you cringe. And don&#8217;t you worry. You don&#8217;t have to pay for a single thing. It will be a champagne night, no doubt. Like champagne, do you?�
Kim nodded. �To be honest, Miss Rich, I&#8217;ve never tried real champagne. I&#8217;ve only had kind of like the bubbly stuff.�
�Well yeah, I like the bubbly stuff too darling. But for this woman, only the real thing will ever do. She&#8217;s too much of a high flyer for the bubbly stuff. Plus, she&#8217;s hot. She&#8217;ll probably be all over you. Such a sweet looking beautiful girl that you are. Just to warn you, honey,� Miss Rich winked.
�You� you mean� she&#8217;s like� a lesbian?�
�Yup. Out and out! Many of our clients are too. Not just Jillian. I guess, well, I sort of attract those type of clients to our firm. Which is of course why I am now managing director, darling. I hit the hot buttons, you see. I get the top flight clients. I work hard and I gain results. Simple.�
�Yes, indeed, Miss Rich,� Kimberly smiled politely. 
�And Kimberly.� Kimberley maintained eye contact. �You will learn exactly how to do the same. That, my darling, is the reason I employed you. You&#8217;re so beautiful. Your looks are very alluring. My clients will adore you. You have the looks and also the brain to be the best of the best. No doubting it, darling. It&#8217;s why I chose you out of hundreds of other candidates. You have the potential!�
�Wow, thanks Miss Rich. So kind of you to say so. You think I can be like you then, Miss Rich?�
�Yes. Yes girl. Yes, you can be just like me. If you follow my tutelage, you&#8217;ll be as good as me. And Kimberly��
�Yes Miss Rich?� 
�D&#8217;you know how much I make in a year?�
�Erm� no. No I don&#8217;t�
�I&#8217;ll tell you. Not something I like to discuss. I hate gossip. But I&#8217;ll tell you since we&#8217;re going to be so close, you and I. Last year I made almost 3 million quid. This year, it&#8217;s going to be even more. If you&#8217;re good, which I think you will be, you&#8217;re going to be seeing some excellent results. Your bank account will be flooded. I mean, you can&#8217;t spend it all as fast as you&#8217;re earning it. Trust me, young lady. You&#8217;re going to be so well off you&#8217;ll not know what hit you. But!�
�Kimberly&#8217;s eyes widened. �But� but what, Miss Rich?�
�But! You have to do exactly as I say, and when I say it. No choice. That&#8217;s it. Simple equation, my girl. Simple. Are you willing to do exactly like I say? Are you?�
�Well� yes� yes, Miss Rich. I&#8217;ll do what it takes. I mean� I want to earn good money, you know. I want to pay back my parents for all the hardship they&#8217;ve gone through to get me through education. I want to live a good life. I&#8217;m sort of tired of just scraping by. It&#8217;s not much fun. I&#8217;ve watched my parents scrape by each month and I don&#8217;t want to do that. I don&#8217;t want to be the same as them. I want much better.�
�Yes, that&#8217;s right, my girl. That is right! You want better, and you will get a whole lot better. Just you do as I tell you to do, and you&#8217;ll get everything you want in life. Is that clear?�
�Yes, that&#8217;s clear Miss Rich. Thank� thank you for such a wonderful opportunity. I&#8217;m just so� well� happy to be working with you. Thanks so much.�
�Pleasure darling. Pleasure. Now, just do some emails at the moment, then we&#8217;ll go out for brunch or lunch, or call it what you will. I imagine that you&#8217;ve not yet eaten, Kimberly. You must be hungry. There&#8217;s a lovely little place that I frequent just over the road, and we&#8217;ll go there. They do a super breakfast and lunch.&nbsp; All in the authentic Italian style. You name it, really� And the espresso is delightful. It&#8217;s an excellent pick-me-up and really gets you set for the day ahead. I often take an early breakfast there, but we&#8217;re a little late for that today, so lunch will do just fine.�
�That sounds lovely, Miss Rich. And yes, I am a bit hungry. I never managed to get any breakfast this morning. I&#8217;ve only had coffee.�
�Great! Over brunch, lunch, whatever� I&#8217;ll enlighten you as to what I expect from you. It&#8217;s a lot, but don&#8217;t you worry, I&#8217;m sure you can deal with everything I throw in your direction.�
Kimberly smiled. She returned to her lengthy list of emails.







Chapter 3

The Lunch Break





�Okay, darling, it&#8217;s now 11.52. I&#8217;d say that was an appropriate time to stop for lunch. Let&#8217;s go, shall we? Just leave the computer on. It&#8217;s perfectly safe to do so. Grab your jacket and let&#8217;s get out of here for a bit.�
Kimberly was so hungry, so to hear her boss tell her they should stop for lunch was welcome news. �Sounds fantastic!� she said. She went to fetch her jacket. Miss Rich was already at the door. �Let me put this on you. Such a pretty little top it is. But from now on, I&#8217;ll expect Gucci, Versace, Valentino. Nothing but the best for Yang and Archibald employees, darling. Nothing but the best for you��
�Thank you Miss Rich. Thanks.�
Miss Rich draped the jacket over Kimberly&#8217;s shoulders. �There, that&#8217;s better,� she said. �And this blouse, what&#8217;s it made of &#8211; silk?� Miss Rich gently caressed Kimberly&#8217;s chest as she touched her blouse.
�Erm� well yes, it&#8217;s just a Chinese version of silk. Nothing fancy, really.�
Her boss rested her hand on Kimberly&#8217;s breast. �Hmmm� that will not do, my darling. We&#8217;ll have to get you fitted out with some superior wear. You can&#8217;t possibly be meeting my clients wearing cheap clothing now can you, my love.� Miss Rich smiled.
Kimberly squirmed. �Emmm� no, not at all. I� I� it would be lovely to be able to get some really� really nice clothing for a change.�
�Well, Kim, as I said, if you do exactly as I say, you will be at liberty to buy anything you wish. Now please, let&#8217;s go, shall we. I know you are famished. Best we eat or you&#8217;ll be no good for anything.� Miss Rich removed her hand from Kimberly&#8217;s ample bosom.
�Yes, yes indeed. I agree. I really do need to eat something. Yes��
Minutes later they arrived at the restaurant.
�This, my darling, is one of my favourites. The service here is just so out of this world. Wait, you&#8217;ll see. They really do provide the &#8216;personal&#8217; touch.�
Kim and Miss Rich were greeted by a beautiful waitress, smartly dressed in black.
�Bonjourno, Madam Rich. Lovely to see you again. Welcome,� the waitress said, with a light Italian accent.
Miss Rich leaned over and kissed her on both cheeks. �Honey, you do look rather fetching today. Hope you are well. This, by the way, is Kim. She&#8217;s my new pa.�
�Oh, such a magnificent looking young lady, she is!� the waitress exclaimed.
�Yes, isn&#8217;t she just. We&#8217;ve come over so that we get some peace and quiet from those incessant phone calls, and I can explain exactly what&#8217;s required of her. Darling, can you give us a quiet table? You know, one that&#8217;s away from those that like to ear-drop.�
�Why, yes, of course. Certainly. Please follow. Per favore, fate seguire ...�
The pretty waitress led the ladies to the far end of the restaurant. 
�Miss Rich, it is good for you?�
�This, my darling, is perfect, thank you so much.�
The waitress smiled.
Today, our chef&#8217;s special is a Mario Batali style Cannelloni alla Toscana. But please, do feel free to choose from thee a la carte.�
Kimberly was amazed at just how palatial the place was. She&#8217;d never dined in such a beautiful restaurant in her entire life. �Oh my god, if this is how things are to be from now on, then I&#8217;m off to an incredible start,� she mused.
�Kim, honey, what would you care to have?� her boss asked.
�Oh, I&#8217;d love to go a la carte, please.�
�Okay, honey,� Miss Rich turned her attention back to the waitress. �A la carte it is then��
The waitress bowed. �Un momento per favore Madam�. She turned and left the two ladies to privacy.
Now, please, come closer. We&#8217;ve a lot to discuss. I prefer that you are closer. Come�� Miss Rich patted the seat beside her, beckoning Kim to get closer.
Kimberly shuffled along the seat.
�And do take your top off. You&#8217;ll get far too warm if you keep that on,� her boss directed.
Kimberly removed her top.
�There, that&#8217;s so much better. Makes for such a better dining experience, don&#8217;t you think so, more comfy, right?� Miss Rich stared at Kimberly&#8217;s chest.
�Yes, yes, that&#8217;s true, Miss Rich.�
 �Now, darling, as I was saying. I need to discuss some business matters with you. Sure, we are dining and all, and I know you&#8217;re hungry. Nevertheless, this is important. It&#8217;s important that we have an understanding right from the very beginning.�
�Certainly, Miss Rich.�
�Okay, good. Good to have your full attention.� Miss Rich placed her hand on Kim&#8217;s thigh. �You see, what I need from you, Kimmy, darling, is your full consent. Basically, what I&#8217;m saying is� You abide by my rules. You answer to me and me alone. You stick with my policies. You don&#8217;t question anything I ask of you. Is that clear, Kimberly?�
Kimberly leaned forward in the seat, feeling a little uncomfortable. �Emmm� yes, I think so, Miss Rich. Yes, of course.�
�Fine. We&#8217;re really heading in the right direction. And, Kimberly, what I offer in return for your, how to say, your acquiescence� well, everything you want. Everything you&#8217;ve ever wanted. Everything that your parents have probably ever wanted for you, and more... Is that clear?�
�Yes, Miss Rich. That&#8217;s perfectly clear, thank you so much.�
�Good. Now darling. Firstly, just before we make our food order, I want you to pull up that little skirt of yours and let&#8217;s just see what we&#8217;re dealing with.� Miss Rich stared into Kim&#8217;s eyes.
�B� but� Miss Rich. I� you know. I� I can&#8217;t sort of do that. S� sorry. But��
�But what, Miss Jones? You can do it and you will do it. What would you prefer, darling? You prefer that you&#8217;re back at home with your parents, slave labouring in some shitty job or other? Or you prefer that you are with me, one of the most powerful women in the whole of the country? Which is it, Kim? Which�?�
�I� I, well� I much prefer to be here, working with you, Miss Rich, Ma&#8217;am.�
�Perfect! And that&#8217;s exactly what I thought, Kimberly. Perfect. See? I knew you&#8217;d be the ideal girl for this job. I told you, didn&#8217;t I? Now, all I need from you right now is to hitch up that pretty little skirt you have on and then part your thighs just a little bitty. See, it gives me access to my dessert, even before I&#8217;ve ordered it.� Miss Rich laughed.
�But, Miss Rich, someone might see me� see us.�
�Oh no matter, baby. They all know that I like what I like in this establishment. In fact, the girl that you met at the door, our waitress. Well, she&#8217;s mine too. She&#8217;s a weekender, as I like to put it. She&#8217;s sweet. Hot. Very hot. But she&#8217;s all mine. I control her. She does exactly as I say and when I say it. See? Nothing to worry about at all, honey pie. Oh, and Kimberly, darling, do loosen up that blouse, will you. It looks just so constricting on you. How the devil am I supposed to get in there if your blouse is so, so tight on you?�
Kimberly looked down. She couldn&#8217;t possibly. But if she chose not to, that would be the end of her career hopes with Yang and Archibald Law Firm. She really had little choice in the matter. Her parents would be devastated. She&#8217;d never live it down.
�Okay, Miss Rich. I� I don&#8217;t, well, you know. I don&#8217;t normally do� do this. But okay then��
Miss Rich nodded her approval. �That&#8217;s right Kimmy, baby, you don&#8217;t have any choice. From now on in, you belong to me, just like our lovely waitress also belongs to me. That&#8217;s final. That&#8217;s all there is to it. Welcome to my club, Kimmy, darling.� Miss Rich grinned. �Now all you have to do is stand up, pull that lovely little skirt of yours up. Then sit. Loosen up on that blouse you have clinging ever so tightly to your beautiful chest, and we&#8217;ll be good to go. Simple. Nothing more I could ask right now. Are we clear?�
Kimmy nodded. She stood up and gingerly pulled at her skirt, bringing it up to waist level.
�Oh darling, such pretty little cute panties you have. Well, you&#8217;re making me all wet already. Please sit. Just part those thighs a bit. Let my fingers do the work. You don&#8217;t have to do anything at all, other than to now loosen your lovely blouse, and then sit back and relax.�
Kim sat down and parted her thighs. 
�A little more, honey. Just a little more��
