Synopsis: One of the Pasha's wives reveals what really went on behind the scenes in Mozart's.The Picture: Constanza's Capitulation 
Time � Late 18 th Century, Place � Harem of the Sublime Porte,
  Istanbul 
Introduction 
Mozart got it all wrong. &nbsp;But then he was a man, and he was an infidel,
  and he had never seen the inside of a seraglio. &nbsp;In fact he had never
  talked to anyone who had been inside a harem. &nbsp;Actually all the events
  he based his opera on had taken place well before he was even born. &nbsp;And
  he left me, probably the most important actor in the drama, out of his opera. &nbsp;Mozart
  focused it on that stupid Constanza who was no more than my tool and my toy. &nbsp;It
  was probably because he was thinking of his vacuous blond wife when he wrote
  music for the concubine's part. &nbsp;And the poor Austrian composer sadly
  underestimated Blonde the serving girl who had ten times the brains and courage
  of her mistress. &nbsp;However, I didn't and Blonde still serves me. But remember,
  my son became the next Pasha and that is what counts. &nbsp;Constanza , in
  the end, provided me with nothing more than a pair of slippers and gloves. 
Part I - Pasha Selim 
Pasha Selim was of course the center of it all. &nbsp;He was, after all, technically
  the ruler of the largest and richest empire on Earth. &nbsp;Theoretically the
  empire of the Ottoman Turks stretched from the Atlantic Coast of Morocco to
  Mughal India and from the Sudan to the Balkans. &nbsp;And Selim was its Pasha. &nbsp;Realistically
  though, most of this empire paid little heed to the Sublime Porte. &nbsp;The
  Islamic emirates of the Southern Mediterranean coast gave only the merest lip-service
  to Istambul . &nbsp;The Mughal emperors of India had not paid homage in almost
  two hundred years. &nbsp;Egypt, Greece and Persia were getting restless under
  Turkish rule. &nbsp;About the only provinces that the Pasha could regard as
  loyal were Anatolia, Arabia, Mesopotamia and the Balkans. &nbsp;Still this
  is not an inconsiderable expanse, larger than any kingdom of infidels. 
But my poor husband Selim was not all-powerful in this limited domain. &nbsp;First
  of all, the actual administration of our loyal territories is by the provincial
  governors who have very little respect for what Istanbul decrees, even in the
  matter of providing troops and tax tribute. &nbsp;On top of this, civil administration
  is really province of the Grand Vizier. &nbsp;The Pasha is supposed to be a
  military leader. &nbsp;&nbsp;Now the Grand Vizier is a eunuch. &nbsp;However,
  the last hundred years or so, the Vizier has been selected from the male offspring
  of a closely intermarried group of families. &nbsp;These families also supply
  the young girls from among whom are selected the four wives of the Pasha. &nbsp;Without
  armies and money the job of the Pasha - go out and conquer - has become a joke. &nbsp;And
  as the job has become a joke so has the man. &nbsp;It has been a hundred years
  since we stood before the gate of Vienna while the infidels trembled. &nbsp;And
  it has probably been a hundred years since a real man sat the throne of the
  Sublime Porte on the shores of the Golden Horn. &nbsp;Now he sits in his harem
  and we his four wives bicker and scheme for his favor. 
At the time of this story Selim was actually a handsome man. &nbsp;When Constanza
  came into our lives he was not the elderly corpulent buffoon usually depicted
  on the stage. &nbsp;He was in fact a fine figure of man although not exactly
  hung like a bull. &nbsp;His mustache and beard were neatly trimmed and he allowed
  us to dress him well, although he resisted sumptuous garb. &nbsp;His fatal
  flaw was that he had nothing to do. &nbsp;The Grand Vizier, my first cousin
  on my mother's side and my second cousin on my father's side, did not bother
  Selim with the nasty details of government and insulated him from petitioners
  who would only cause my husband upset. &nbsp;In reality, Selim seldom set foot
  outside the Seraglio and its twenty acres of inner courtyards. &nbsp;Instead
  he heavily indulged in the hooka and a bubble pipe was ever at his side. &nbsp;One
  benefit of being supreme in a vast Middle East empire was having access to
  every form of formidable hashish. &nbsp;I myself have never cared for the resin. &nbsp;After
  the age of fifteen when he assumed the thone , Selim probably never had a whole
  day with a clear head. &nbsp;Well, that was not his task in our society. &nbsp;His
  job was to father a son to carry on the line. &nbsp;For that purpose he had
  the four wives permitted by the Koran. &nbsp;In that respect he was observant. &nbsp;And
  in never touching alcohol. &nbsp;And in the first few years of his reign, he
  did pay some attention to us and fathered many children. &nbsp;Three with his
  number one wife, Fatima , one with me, Miriam, and two each with wives number
  three and four. &nbsp;Unfortunately, except for my Mahmoud , they were all
  girls. &nbsp;Actually there were a number of male babies born but all of them
  except for my Mahmoud , did at birth or within a day or so of birth. &nbsp;Very
  unfortunate for them. &nbsp;But at the time of our story, Mahmoud was not yet
  conceived. 
And then there were the concubines. &nbsp;But more of that later.
Part II � Constanza's Origins 
&nbsp;She came from an excellent family, dukes, rulers of a tiny German principality. &nbsp;She
  was raised in ignorance of intrigue. &nbsp;She was pampered and her every whim
  indulged. &nbsp;Of the brutality inherent in all ruling classes she knew nothing. &nbsp;She
  knew even less of the harsh lives that the vast majority of humans suffered. &nbsp;When
  she was fourteen years old she was betrothed to an Italian prince of the two
  Sicilies and a year later was sent off to his parents capital. &nbsp;It happened
  as always happens in such tales. &nbsp;Her ship, on the way from Trieste to
  Naples was blown out to sea in a storm and later becalmed. &nbsp;Sitting in
  a glassy sea it was happened across by a fleet of Barbary galleys. &nbsp;
The captain and crew of the sloop threw themselves into the sea rather than
  be captured. &nbsp;They drowned to a man which was a mercy compared to the
  lot of a galley slave. Constanza's duenna, whom the girl regarded as an ancient
  though in fact she only 30 years old, met the pirates at the gangplank. &nbsp;She
  glared defiantly at them and recited in both German, French and Italian the
  young noblewoman's qualities and ancestors as well as the credentials of the
  three Italian noblewomen escorting her to their relatives. &nbsp;For this effort,
  the lady was swiftly stripped. &nbsp;Then her sex and anus were raped and her
  nipples bitten off by over two-dozen pirates. &nbsp;She was allowed to bleed
  to death on the deck in front of the horrified Constanza , her maid, and her
  three Italian ladies in waiting. &nbsp;The duenna was to be an abject lesson.
  Because in this case, the chief of the corsairs was a bey . &nbsp;He was all
  too aware of the beauty and value of his catch and forbade his men from immediately
  having their pleasure with the young women. &nbsp;Instead they sent a young
  Turk of noble birth as an envoy off to Naples demanding a fittingly large ransom. &nbsp;The
  cruel and callous Italians castrated and flayed the corsairs' envoy and cast
  his still breathing body into the sea. &nbsp;They drank sweet yellow wine and
  listened to his screams as he died. &nbsp;They drafted a reply stating that
  they would meet the Barbary pirates in battle at sea and called upon the Sublime
  Porte to reprimand their emir. &nbsp;They vowed that if one hair of their daughters'
  heads were harmed, they would burn Algiers and Tunis to the ground. &nbsp;The
  message was wrapped around the envoy's genitals and tossed aboard the pirates'
  messenger vessel. &nbsp;After this, the Barbary pirates sold Constanza and
  the ladies-in-waiting to my father, the representative of the Sublime Porte
  in Tunis, and suggested that she would be a suitable tribute from Barbary to
  the throne. 
My father was not intimidated by the Neopolitans . &nbsp;He summoned the company
  of mercenaries who comprised his loyal bodyguard. &nbsp;The young ladies were
  brought before him and his troops. &nbsp;He instructed the women to all disrobe. &nbsp;When
  they refused he had two soldiers hold each of them securely while my mother's
  maids carefully undressed each of them, tearing not a single seam nor popping
  a single button or hook. &nbsp;Even their shoes and stockings were removed,
  excepting only the ribbons in their hair. &nbsp;Then he had the three ladies-in-waiting
  tied to chairs. &nbsp;He instructed his barber to ever so carefully shave their
  heads, removing their hair without disturbing their coiffure. &nbsp;He had
  their clothing neatly folded and placed in three separate boxes and the hairpieces
  placed on top. &nbsp;Then with the scourge, the three young ladies were given
  a mosaic number of lashes, that is two score less one. &nbsp;Their bleeding
  bodies were assaulted by a dozen of his troops although he forbad them to abuse
  them to death. &nbsp;Then he gave orders to three of fastest, most powerful
  Ottoman galleys. &nbsp;Each was to take one of the Italian girls and transport
  her back to Italy, dropping her off at a small, poorly-defended coastal city. &nbsp;Along
  the way, each day the noblewoman was to be beaten and abused in a different
  way than she was the previous day. &nbsp;But not allowed to die. &nbsp;If she
  perished he would have the captain flayed. &nbsp;And on the voyage, each day,
  the girl's head was shaved. &nbsp;When the three fleets reached Italy they
  sacked the three appointed towns. &nbsp;They killed all the men and ate the
  flesh of their dogs. &nbsp;The children they enslaved. &nbsp;The women, no
  matter how old, they raped. &nbsp;Afterwards they left a lady-in-waiting with
  the degraded women. &nbsp;And so was the first part of my father's decree done. 
Part III � Constanza's At The Sublime Porte 
Thus, almost two years after she set out from Germany, I met Constanza . &nbsp;My
  father had been called back to Istanbul and congratulated by the Vizier, who
  happened to be his cousin. &nbsp;My father had met the Italian insult and done
  them one better. &nbsp;The Vizier laughed until he lost control of his bladder
  at the thought of the Italian's receiving their daughters' intact hair and
  their ravaged beyond belief daughters. &nbsp;The girls had all gone mad from
  their abuse. &nbsp;When he saw the beauty of my father's gift, the eunuch summoned
  me from the palace. &nbsp;Few infidels realize that the wife of the pasha can
  leave the seraglio but only to visit her closest family and then only with
  a massive retinue. &nbsp;Since my father was the most powerful man in the western
  empire and my cousin was the Vizier, none would argue with them. &nbsp;And
  Selim was too befuddled to care. &nbsp;&nbsp;
When I arrived, the Vizier told Constanza and her maid, whose name was Blondie,
  to strip. &nbsp;After the horrors that they had witnessed, they complied. &nbsp;I
  was bemused by the grace with which the seventeen year old young woman removed
  her cumbersome western infidel apparel, albeit with the help of her maid. Constanza
  had a slim but beautiful body. &nbsp;Her breasts, although fully developed,
  were not large but never-the-less immediately attracted the stares of all the
  men. &nbsp;Even my cousin the Grand Vizier. &nbsp;Pleasing breasts although
  not as voluptuous as mine. &nbsp;Very pleasing nipples, although not as large
  as mine. &nbsp;Her buttocks were feminine and her legs slim. &nbsp;Above it
  all was a crown of long curly yellow hair. &nbsp;Constanza was clearly a thing
  of wonder to behold. &nbsp;She was instructed to sit on the end of a chaise
  lounge, lie back and spread her legs. &nbsp;These were then lifted and further
  spread by two of my slave maidens to facilitate my inspection. &nbsp;I first
  visually examined her nether region and then thoroughly explored her manually. &nbsp;I
  reported, to my amazement and the amazement of all that she was flawless. &nbsp;No
  scars and a virgin intact! &nbsp;My father retorted that the corsairs obviously
  feared him worse than they feared the Italians or even Allah himself. &nbsp;When
  he said he wanted a present fit for the Pasha, he meant it. 
Blonde, Constanza's hand-maid was also examined. &nbsp;She had a remarkable
  fluency with language and in the year and a half of her captivity had acquired
  a passable command of not only Arabic but also our somewhat more difficult
  Turkish language. &nbsp;She said that she was nineteen, two years older than
  Costanza , and had she served her since she was eleven and Constanza was nine. &nbsp;Blonde,
  as befitting her name also had yellow hair, but while Constanza's hair was
  a dark yellow, Blonde's hair, even her nether hair, was pale yellow. &nbsp;Blonde's
  body was full and voluptuous, ever fuller than mine. &nbsp;Her breasts were
  large as were her hips and thighs. &nbsp;Suprisingly , at that time, her waist
  was narrow, smaller in fact than was Constanza's . &nbsp;Of course, in later
  years this waist thickened and Blonde became quite corpulent. &nbsp;But that
  is another story. &nbsp;My final amazement was that Blonde too, had an unbroken
  hymen. &nbsp;Quite a matched pair for my Selim , two blond infidel virgins,
  one of high rank. 
So my father, my cousin and I sat down and discussed our plans over several
  glasses of truly superb red Hungarian wine. &nbsp;For although the Magyars
  had thrown off our yoke, they were willing to trade to us their �Bull's Blood�. &nbsp;We
  jokingly maintained that since the infidels called it �bulls blood� it could
  not come under the Prophet's injunction forbidding the fruit of the vine. &nbsp;Obviously,
  we would gain favor from my husband by presenting him with a beautiful and
  exotic concubine. &nbsp;However, she must be used to manipulate Selim but not
  to the point where he became so besotted with her that she would bend him to
  her wishes. &nbsp;And above all he must never stud a son upon a concubine. &nbsp;Even
  though the spawn of a concubine should not be in line for the throne, yet such
  offspring might always be used to complicate matters during times of turmoil. &nbsp;Long
  into the night we discussed family matters and just before we broke we decided
  to present Constanza to the Pasha early in the morning when he was relatively
  clear headed. &nbsp;We had the infidel brought in and bade her maid to make
  Constanza thoroughly clean. &nbsp;For presentation to Selim she would be garbed
  in her most sumptuous dress, the one that she would have worn for her presentation
  to the court in Naples. &nbsp;I figured that nothing would get my husband's
  attention like the slow and elegant removal of so many layers of clothing,
  ribbons, lace and lacings. &nbsp;It was so nice to be able to explain this
  to the maid without the intermediary of an interpreter. &nbsp;This would be
  interesting. 
Part IV � Constanza's Presentation 
One hour before dawn, I marched with my retinue from the Palace of the Sublime
  Porte to the Palace of the Grand Vizier where my father was staying. &nbsp;When
  shortly after having married Selim I first received permission to leave the
  Sublime Harem in order to give greetings to my family I was embarrassed by
  the fuss and throng of retainers I was forced to take with me. &nbsp;Yes, I
  realized that the whole point of the whole thing was to make sure that a large
  enough crowd went with me so that I could not ever be intimate with any man. &nbsp;Still,
  two hand maids, five ladies-in-waiting, six common maids to carry the canopy
  over my head, ten eunuchs of the 2 nd grade, and fifty janissaries seemed a
  little much. &nbsp;Eventually I realized my place and the meaning of it all. &nbsp;Now,
  I never leave the palace with less than 200. &nbsp;I love to tease my cousin
  the Grand Vizier about it. &nbsp;Because his palace is the only place I ever
  meet any of my family. &nbsp;And he has to provide meals for my retinue. &nbsp;Well,
  he can afford it. &nbsp;
At dawn I met my father in the outermost courtyard of the Dark Palace. &nbsp;By
  his side stood Constanza in a yellow gown with a yellow lace veil over her
  head. &nbsp;Since my marriage it has been forbidden for me to embrace my father,
  so I stood three feet away and bowed as low as my status would allow. &nbsp;�How
  are you honored and beloved father� I inquired. &nbsp;�Happy to submit to the
  will of God� he replied and continued �and how is my daughter beloved of his
  Sublime Majesty?� &nbsp;�I am happy to bask in the light of the Sublime one� I
  responded and replied �and how is the most beloved of my brothers?� &nbsp;Father
  said �he resides, tended to by forty maidens, in the bosom of Allah�. &nbsp;We
  would never forget. &nbsp;Finally after the pain cleared from his eyes he got
  down to the purpose of the day. &nbsp;�Daughter of mine and Second Wife of
  the Pasha, I present to you for presentation to our lord, the fruit of the
  West, an Infidel Daughter of a Mighty Infidel King, a worthless piece of porcine
  feces compared to the might of our Majesty. &nbsp;I beg you to offer it for
  his pleasure.� &nbsp;�Esteemed father� I replied �and most powerful servant
  of our Majesty, come with me and enter into the deepest fastness of the Sublime
  Porte so that you may gaze upon our Pasha who few can behold without involuntary
  urination and defecation.� &nbsp;Then we both turned to our cousin the Grand
  Vizier and invited �Come with us external manipulator of the power of our Pasha
  and assist us in presenting this offspring of swine to the Great One.� 
So an hour after dawn we set out back to the seraglio. &nbsp;Fifty of the
  Vizier's Nubian guards, eunuchs of the 3 rd grade, wearing only loin cloths
  on this cold fall day, their bodies glistening from olive oil. &nbsp;Their
  muscles bulged since they were made less than men only when fully grown. &nbsp;And
  their loincloths bulged since only their balls were removed from their scrotums. &nbsp;They
  occupied all of their time in exercise in order to maintain their muscle tone. &nbsp;And
  I can assure you that they were capable of erections despite the fact that
  they could not father children. &nbsp;Then marched my father and my cousin,
  waving to the crowd that had assembled following my predawn trip to the Black
  Palace. &nbsp;And my male relatives rewarded the homage of the crowd by tossing
  copper coins to them. &nbsp;Which is why the crowd had assembled in the first
  place and gave such an enthusiastic welcome. &nbsp;Then came my one hundred
  Crimean janissaries, light of skin but with slanted eyes. &nbsp;Children of
  infidels, taken at age five and brought up to know nothing but obedience to
  the Sublime Porte. &nbsp;Silence greeted their passage for their were the Pasha's
  own personal bodyguard and they were accorded the same respect as the Sublime
  himself. &nbsp;Then I walked under my canopy, the sides of which were veiled
  so that none could look directly upon me, the Pasha's number two wife. &nbsp;Immediately
  behind be were the two blond-haired infidels in their exotic finery. &nbsp;Every
  neck craned to view them for their presence was exotic even here in Istanbul,
  the crossroads of the world. &nbsp;Lastly came one hundred of my father's mercenaries
  who drew cheers from the crowd because they represented the only military victory
  we had won in a decade. &nbsp;Even though it be only the sacking of three defenseless
  villages by a distant sea. &nbsp;The mercenaries were in town and soon the
  forbidden wine would flow in a few select taverns. &nbsp;And strumpets would
  entertain for far more than their usual price. 
When we reached the outer precincts of the palace the Vizier's black guard
  and my father's mercenaries stopped and were offered food and drink. &nbsp;None
  but the imperial janissaries would enter the palace grounds proper bearing
  weapons. &nbsp;Thus diminished we enter the Harem of the Sublime Porte. &nbsp;After
  passage through a dozen corridors we approached the chamber where my husband
  was to receive us whereupon the remaining guards returned to the outer precincts. &nbsp;For
  it was forbidden for intact men to remain long so deep within the seraglio
  and besides they wanted to join in the festivities with the other soldiers. &nbsp;The
  chamber that Selim had chosen to meet us in was surprisingly shoddy for the
  favorite abode of the most powerful potentate on earth. &nbsp;The furniture
  was decrepit, the plaster falling off the walls and there was no sign of the
  artistic treasures that four hundred years of empire had accumulated. &nbsp;About
  the only thing that was well maintained was his hookah. &nbsp;Fortunately,
  since it was two hours after dawn he had just arisen and had not yet had his
  first water-pipe full. &nbsp;His eyes, for once, glistened alertly. &nbsp;
My husband the pasha began the conversation for it was forbidden for anyone
  else to speak first. �Well, well! &nbsp;My second wife, my Grand Vizier and
  my most esteemed Grand Envoy of the Supreme Porte, terror of the infidels,
  I understand that you are bringing me a prize and a gift.� &nbsp;I dropped
  to my knees and bowed until my nipples brushed the mosaic tile floor. &nbsp;I
  motioned forward the two young women. &nbsp;�Well, well indeed, a most unusual
  deed has been accomplished by our Admiral General. &nbsp;But I see that they
  do not observe the custom, here in the harem, that women do not appear before
  me with their busoms covered.� &nbsp;I, of course, had discarded my cloak before
  entering his chamber baring my magnificent breasts with their huge nipples
  and wide dark brown areolae . &nbsp;I explained, �my beloved husband, bull
  of Allah, these two are ignorant of our ways being infidel virgins. &nbsp;And
  besides we wished to show before you the sumptuous splendor of their native
  dress, in particular that of the veiled who is a queen of Germanic infidels
  sent to be married to a king of Italian infidels. &nbsp;Behold their beauty.� &nbsp;
I nodded to them and Blonde stepped forward and slowly began to disrobe. &nbsp;As
  befits a maid she was dressed in a simple straw-colored peasant dress, with
  her bosom encased in a tan bustier. &nbsp;With her eyes downcast she unlaced
  the front-closing bustier and handed it to the eunuch standing behind her.
  Ah, we was proceeding as I instructed her. &nbsp;Then she unloosed the drawstring
  chinching the neck of her dress and drew her dress down over her hips, dropping
  it to the floor and stepping out of it. &nbsp;The light dress was quickly removed
  by the eunuch. &nbsp;Blonde stood there in her off-white linen shift and simple
  petticoat. &nbsp;The petticoat was slowly untied and dropped, revealing a set
  of white drawers. &nbsp;The tape securing the drawers around Blonde's waist
  was also slowly untied and the drawers removed one leg at a time. &nbsp;The
  servant was now clad only in shift, stockings and slippers. &nbsp;Lastly, she
  untied the ribbon lacing together the front of her shift, slid the straps off
  her shoulders and deliberately lowered this last remaining undergarment revealing
  momentarily her massive breast and blonde thatched mons . Modestly Bonlde covered
  her nipples with her right forearm and her sex with her left hand. &nbsp;I
  bowed once again, tickling my nipples on the chill tiles and said, �May I present
  a humble hand maiden, unworthy of your concern. &nbsp;I thought it improper
  for her to be overdressed when disrobing her lady.� 
Blonde took the my hint and began to undress Constanza . &nbsp;First she removed
  the cloak, decorated with gold and silver thread and handed it to a waiting
  eunuch. &nbsp;Then she removed from Constanza's waist the girdle inlaid with
  precious stones. &nbsp;Going in back of her mistress, Blonde began to unhook
  the back of her mistresses gold brocade dress, a process that took some time. &nbsp;Once
  she had accomplished that task, from the back she took the hands that Constanza
  had crossed over her chest and lowered them to the noblewoman's side. &nbsp;Then
  the maid slid the gown over Constanza's shoulders and down her body until the
  stiff cloth was bundled on the ground. &nbsp;The maid told her mistress to
  step forward for further inspection by the Pasha. &nbsp;Selim had heard of
  the complexity of western garb but he had never encountered it up close before. &nbsp;He
  beheld a blond with her camisole bound about with a stout corset and her petticoats
  projected out to the sides by a panier completely distorting the girls figure. &nbsp;Blonde
  instructed Constanza to turn around several times so that the eastern potentate
  could see her from every angle. &nbsp;Then the servant began the task of unlacing
  the back of Constanza's corset. &nbsp;Much to our amazement, when the corset
  was removed, the young noblewoman's breasts did not sag in the least, such
  was the splendor of her youth. &nbsp;Before the crinoline petticoat could be
  removed, Blonde had to reach up under it and unfasten the pannier that splayed
  the petticoat out to the sides. &nbsp;Finally the voluminous underskirt could
  be released. &nbsp;This revealed Constanza clad in a surprisingly brief camisole
  and drawers. &nbsp;Blonde undid the tabs at the back of the drawers and drew
  them down over the thighs and calves of the girl revealing the bright yellow
  patch decorating her mistress's pubis. &nbsp;It took a bit of effort to get
  the narrow leg openings of the lower undergarment over Constanza's ankles and
  shoes, which afforded tantalizing glimpses of the girl's sex. &nbsp;Finally,
  the servant removed the bulky footwear and her mistress stood there clad only
  in a skimpy camisole and hose. &nbsp;I wondered how Blonde would remove her
  mistresses extremely close fitting camisole with the elegance that had accompanied
  the disrobing so far. &nbsp;Blonde bowed low to my husband and approached on
  her hands and knees. &nbsp;With her head touching the floor she asked in passable
  Turkish if she could borrow my husband's small dagger. &nbsp;We all sucked
  in our breath. &nbsp;But he only laughed and flipped it out in front of her. &nbsp;Blonde
  walked over to Constanza and cut the shoulder straps of her camisole and then
  slit it right down the center from in between her breasts to the hem just at
  the navel. &nbsp;Blonde whipped off the cut garment and flipped it to the waiting
  eunuch and handed the Pasha's knife over to the Grande Vizier. &nbsp;She turned
  to my husband and said in crude Turkish �Never again will milady come before
  you other than as a bare-breasted supplicant�. &nbsp;We were all shocked into
  silent amazement. 
To say the least, my plans had been totally disrupted by the clever handmaiden,
  but I recovered quickly. &nbsp;I had to bring the audience to an end before
  my husband's mind wandered off into some obscure path. &nbsp;�Would you like
  to inspect your gift more closely my stallion to verify that she is truly a
  virgin.� &nbsp;I could see that he had lost all interest in the lady compared
  to the serving girl. &nbsp;�No, No, I trust you my buxom nightingale� he said
  to me, just make sure that she is still intact when you bring her to me for
  my pleasure. &nbsp;And make sure her skin is still creamy and smooth when I
  see her next.� &nbsp;My husband had obviously caught word of some of the chastisements
  I had been handing out to the concubines as part of their training. &nbsp;�But
  my pizzle of the elephant, may I at least be allowed to train her to the standards
  of performance expected by a good daughter of Islam� I implored. &nbsp;�Let
  me turn her into a good Muslim girl.� &nbsp;He responded �Very well, see to
  it. &nbsp;I assume you will train her to put her lips to good use�. &nbsp;Ah
  ha! &nbsp;His fondness for fellatio was becoming more pronounced. &nbsp;I replied �I
  will make sure this worthless concubine will pleasure you to the ultimate degree�. &nbsp;I
  would take advantage of his weakness. &nbsp;Then he added, �You may graze this
  blond cow among your maids� he said, referring to Blonde �I'm am sure she will
  provide ample amusement. &nbsp;But remember, don't bring me any more concubines
  that have been flogged half to death. &nbsp;At least not for the first time
  they are to pleasure me. &nbsp;After that, you can do with them what you will
  if I have no further use for them.� &nbsp;At that point he had one of his eunuchs
  filled the bowl of the hubble bubble with red resin and brought a coal from
  the brazier that was taking the chill from the room. &nbsp;As the Pasha exhaled
  the first smoke we bowed and backed out of the room taking our two flaxen-haired
  young ladies with us. &nbsp;My husband would not be attentive to very much
  for the rest of the day.
Part V � Constanza's Training 
A week later my father visited me. &nbsp;For purposes of formal respectability
  such visits always took place in the middle of the courtyard of my part of
  the seraglio when one and all could see that no untoward behavior of a sexual
  sort was being engaged in by the Pasha's wife. &nbsp;Besides it was one of
  those rare days in late fall when the sun was shining brightly but the air
  was cool and refreshing. &nbsp;We sat on a divan covered in richly embroidered
  pillows while being served a Tokay wine from Hungary and white grapes brought
  by express courier from Slovenia. &nbsp;A bit of goat cheese and olives from
  Greece rounded out the mid day repast. &nbsp;I began, �I am glad that you were
  able to come. &nbsp;Were you able to bring along the slave that I requested.� &nbsp;My
  father looked at me, as displeased as one can look at a daughter who is the
  second or third most powerful person in the empire. &nbsp;�Rumors of some of
  your indulgences have reached to even outside the palace. &nbsp;You should
  be more careful of what you do. &nbsp;Yes I brought the slave.� &nbsp;He nodded
  his head toward a handsome young man standing by the edge of the cloister. &nbsp;�Oh
  father, thank you so much. &nbsp;Things here in the palace are strange and
  I must adapt to the situation. &nbsp;Selim is hard to please and harder to
  excite. &nbsp;Fatima has had five children by him and those three that are
  still living are all girls. &nbsp;He says that when she walks into the room,
  his prick shrivels up. &nbsp;The living children of his two wives lesser than
  me are both girls but they still keep trying. &nbsp;How long until he tires
  of them. &nbsp;I manage to keep him excited. &nbsp;Because I keep him enthralled,
  the other three are jealous. &nbsp;What happens when he will service none of
  us wives? &nbsp;He will turn to his concubines for sons and the Sublime Porte
  will shake to its foundations. &nbsp;Concubines for breeding, it makes me sweat. &nbsp;No
  I must pursue my policy of getting his penis wooden with concubine games and
  then riding him. &nbsp;So if others think me scandalous let only his member
  stay stiff and all will work out for the best.� &nbsp;My father still shook
  his head. �Indulge me� I pleaded. 
After the midday repast was cleared off the low table of Moroccan inlay a
  brazier was brought out followed by the two blond infidels, a woman in a cloak,
  and my physician. &nbsp;Constanza was wearing nothing but a diaphanous wrapper. &nbsp;Blonde
  was dressed in more conventional garb. &nbsp;Silken drawers and a close fitting
  top of matching silk that left her midriff bare. &nbsp;After they approached
  I addressed Blonde who translated for Constanza who stubbornly refused to learn
  any language other than German. &nbsp;�Today your education will continue. &nbsp;Earlier
  this week I explained to you the ways in which a woman may give pleasure to
  a man, a subject that you are singularly ignorant of. &nbsp;Today you will
  receive your first practical lesson.� &nbsp;I waited as Blonde explained things
  and I was not heartened by the look of shock on the face of the slim flaxen-haired
  beauty. &nbsp;I continued �About all you learned before coming here was that
  the female plays a passive role and the man inserts his member and moves it
  in and out until he achieves pleasure. &nbsp;He may make use either of the
  opening that Allah provided for procreation or into the opening through which
  solid waste passes. &nbsp;Your practical experience in these matters is limited
  to watching your duenna being raped to death and the defilement of your three
  ladies in waiting. &nbsp;I understand that throughout most of this time you
  were covering your eyes with your hands.� &nbsp;By the time this was translated,
  Constanza's face was beet red. &nbsp;I continued �In any case, vaginal or anal
  intercourse is not what I have in mind for you. &nbsp;There are plenty of pussies
  and ass-holes for the Pasha to probe in this harem already. &nbsp;You have
  a bit of novelty but that won't serve us long�. &nbsp;I was pleased to note
  that Blonde could pick up the differences between the proper, formal nouns
  for the love holes and the street words for the orifices. &nbsp;The deepening
  of Constanza's blush suggested that the translation was accurate. &nbsp;I wondered
  where the buxom maid was learning her Turkish. &nbsp;I instructed further. &nbsp;�What
  I need is for my husband to become very excited. &nbsp;Once he has achieved
  a proper degree of excitement, I can take over and take advantage of his male
  desires. &nbsp;Do you understand.� &nbsp;Constanza looked profoundly shocked. &nbsp;Very
  good translation. &nbsp;Lastly I explained �Failure to achieve adequate performance
  will have very serious consequences. &nbsp;Constanza , my master has forbade
  me to whip you. &nbsp;He does not want those portions of you skin that can
  be readily seen to be marked. &nbsp;Did you understand that much when we last
  met with him. &nbsp;But I have ways of inflicting pain other than flogging
  you. &nbsp;And Blonde, he said nothing forbidding me from flogging you. &nbsp;If
  your mistress is slow to learn, you body will be used to show her what happens
  when I get angered. &nbsp;Now, Constanza , take off your wrapper.� &nbsp;At
  this Blonde expression became aghast and what she said to Constanza made the
  lithe girl shake with terror. &nbsp;But she complied and soon stood naked before
  us. 
I turned to my father and asked him to summon the young man he had brought
  with him. &nbsp;I in turn summoned the young woman in the cloak. &nbsp;I instructed
  the dark haired servant to remove her cloak whereupon her nakedness was revealed. &nbsp;She
  drew up the robe of my father's servant and undid his loincloth. &nbsp;The
  young man responded to being uncovered in the sight of two naked women with
  a modest erection. &nbsp;My servant then knelt before him and applied her lips
  to his sex. &nbsp;As his member became larger and stiffer she took it into
  his mouth and soon revealed her talent for fellatio. &nbsp;Constanza , who
  was protecting her modesty with her hands and arms was appalled at what they
  were doing. &nbsp;I had never seen a woman blush over her entire body before. &nbsp;I
  was appalled. &nbsp;Blonde merely looked on in fascination. &nbsp;This was
  going to be harder than I thought. &nbsp;Spurred on by the ministrations of
  my dark-haired servant, the young man soon was merrily rendering service to
  her mouth as heartily as if it was the procreative orifice of the finest courtesan
  in the land. &nbsp;Finally he tensed and began to ejaculate. &nbsp;My servant
  removed his penis from her mouth at that point and let him spurt all over her
  face. &nbsp;I spoke to Constanza through Blonde. &nbsp;�See, this is what I
  want you to do.� &nbsp;The girl shook her head back and forth in denial and
  said what in translation amounted to �I will die a thousand deaths first. &nbsp;No
  torture could ever force me to dishonor myself in this way.� &nbsp;She ranted
  on at a considerable length along these lines. &nbsp;Mozart gave his character
  Constanza a similar line of argument in the second act of his opera but he
  was much more eloquent. &nbsp;My Constanza simply ranted. 
Realizing that simple example was not going to motivate the willful blond
  I had my father dismiss his servant and I indicated that he could leave if
  he wanted to. &nbsp;No, he wanted to see exactly what I would do. &nbsp;I guess
  he wanted to know if the rumors about me were true. &nbsp;He said that he had
  been in the thick of many bloody battles and that nothing could surprise him. &nbsp;I
  summoned my eunuchs and had Blonde inform Constanza that she was about to witness
  just the kinds of pain I was capable of causing. &nbsp;My eunuchs took the
  dark-haired serving girl and tied her supine to the low table we had earlier
  lunched on. &nbsp;The woman's buttocks and legs dangled below the foot of the
  table and she was secured by her waist with her hands bound beneath the table. &nbsp;Then
  they raised up her legs, spreading them and securing them at the knee and the
  ankle by cords that ran under the table. &nbsp;Thus bound, her most intimate
  parts were revealed. &nbsp;I gave the naked Constanza a hand mirror. &nbsp;I
  bade her squat and inspect her sex, comparing it with that of the bound servant
  girl. &nbsp;Notice, I said that there was a bit of protuberant flesh just above
  the orifice where her urine came out. &nbsp;My bound servant woman had only
  a scar at that spot. &nbsp;I instructed Blonde to spread the lips of Constanza's
  genital cleft so that the girl could more closely inspect her nether region. &nbsp;Now
  I instructed her to look at my servants vaginal opening, spread wide for all
  to see by her bondage. &nbsp;Again, the area that should have contained inner
  lips held only scar and the scarring involved even the outer lips. &nbsp;And
  my dear Constanza , there is more to this than simple scarring. 
I summoned my favorite eunuch to come forward and for Constanza to sit on
  the divan, open her legs and lean back. &nbsp;My favorite eunuch then demonstrated
  why he was my favorite eunuch by applying his tongue and lips to the beautiful
  blond's clitoris and labia. &nbsp;Soon he was stimulating her love button with
  his large nose while using his tongue to massage that portion of her vagina
  that was accessible before further penetration was blocked by her hymen. &nbsp;Although
  Constanza struggled to maintain her intellectual virginity the skill of my
  favorite eunuch were too much for her and in a surprisingly short period of
  time she had experienced the first orgasm of her life. &nbsp;As she lay there
  panting, my father shook with laughter. &nbsp;�To think that my daughter, the
  closely shielded child of my middle age has become such a wanton. &nbsp;Who
  would have believed it. &nbsp;The rumors are true�. &nbsp;To which I replied, �Remember
  father, only four wives is allowed to a man by the prophet. &nbsp;He has already
  used one up. &nbsp;And the two after me are throwing only girls. &nbsp;If I
  succeed our family will be secure for another generation. &nbsp;It is a deadly
  serious game I play and I intend to be successful at it.� &nbsp;
I went over to the spent Constanza and slapped her sharply but not so severely
  as to leave a bruise. &nbsp;�Get up slut,� I addressed her. &nbsp;�Now that
  you have known pleasure learn about the other realities of life.� &nbsp;I took
  her over to where the dark haired serving girl was bound. &nbsp;�In countries
  where women submit to the will of Allah, many are forced to have those organs
  which give them pleasure snipped. &nbsp;Look and see. &nbsp;Place your fingers
  on her bottom. &nbsp;See, her clitoris is gone. &nbsp;Her labia are gone. &nbsp;Rub
  there, there is nothing to swell, nothing to give pleasure. &nbsp;And yet when
  she first disrobed you noticed nothing amiss. &nbsp;When you were presented
  to my husband as a potential concubine and were given over to me for training,
  you should recall that he and I specifically discussed subjecting you to certain
  practices sacred to Islam. &nbsp;Well this is one of them. &nbsp;It is called
  infundibulation or circumcision of the female. &nbsp;Remember those words I
  spoke, �let me turn her into a good Muslim girl,' Remember those words.� &nbsp;I
  motioned my surgeon forward and he put a knife into the brazier. &nbsp;I continued �And
  at periods of time thereafter, it is sometimes necessary to further sear the
  tissues to make sure that no pleasure is ever again associated with touching
  this area.� &nbsp;I had one of the eunuchs gag my serving woman with a silken
  sash. &nbsp;At this point my doctor applied the heated blade to the area where
  my servants clitoris once resided being very careful not to injure the urethra. &nbsp;The
  woman gave out a heart-rending cry but it was muffled by the silk. &nbsp;Twice
  again the knife was heated and applied to either side of the vaginal opening
  but the searing of the left labia was accompanied by silence because my servant
  became unconscious when her right labia was burned. &nbsp;I had my eunuchs
  untie her and bear her off to my servants areas where she would have her burns
  tended. &nbsp;My surgeon's attention was directed to Constanza who had fainted
  at the third branding. 
While Constanza was revived I instructed Blonde to remove her silken top which
  she did promptly. &nbsp;I then took her over to one of the numerous pomegranates
  which grew in the courtyard. &nbsp;� Constanza �, I instructed, �the pomegranate
  is not really a tree but rather is a bush. &nbsp;Notice how around the base
  of the trunk there are numerous shoots springing up. &nbsp;In order to force
  the pomegranate into the habitus of a tree it is necessary to continually prune
  out these shoots.� &nbsp;I instructed her to remove about six or seven shoots
  which were almost four feet in length and we returned to the center of the
  courtyard. &nbsp;There my father was standing over the naked Constanza , seated
  on the divan, who had just recovered from her faint. &nbsp;I put Blonde to
  work binding the butts of the pomegranate sprouts together. &nbsp;I paid my
  attentions to Constanza . &nbsp;I took her beautiful chin in my left hand and
  slapped her left cheek with my right hand and then applied the back of my right
  hand to the right side of her face. &nbsp;If there were bruises, they would
  fade before I had to present her to Selim again. &nbsp;�Slut, do you see what
  lies ahead for you. &nbsp;If in one week you show any deficiencies in your
  ability to arouse a man with your mouth I will make a good Muslim girl of you. &nbsp;Between
  now and then, every morning and every afternoon you will practice on the eunuchs
  of the Black Guard, those that were castrated when adults. &nbsp;If you can
  bring a eunuch to cum you will have learned your trade well. &nbsp;Meanwhile
  there are other lessons to learn.� &nbsp;
I instructed my eunuchs to bind up the wrists of Blonde to the branches of
  the persimmon tree where we had lunch. &nbsp;It was late enough in the year
  so that the persimmon had lost it leaves but although the fruit had all turned
  from green to orange they were just becoming red, soft and ready to eat. &nbsp;I
  put the bundle of pomegranate switches into Constanza's hand and led her over
  to where Blonde was strung up on her tip toes. &nbsp;�You failed your servant. &nbsp;Blonde
  did a good job today while you blanched, blushed and fainted. &nbsp;It is forbidden,
  at this point, to whip you. &nbsp;So instead Blonde will suffer for you, and
  you will wield the scourge. &nbsp;Consider the thin but resilient shoots of
  the pomegranate. &nbsp;They are not heavy enough to bruise but they sting,
  and if properly applied they can cut the skin. &nbsp;Now pull down her silken
  pantaloons and leave no part of her body above the knees and below the neck
  untouched. &nbsp;You will whip her until all the fruit has been shaken from
  the persimmon tree or until I tell you to stop. &nbsp;Remember the price of
  failure to perform in a task I have given you. &nbsp;Do you want to be an infidel
  or a good Muslim girls.� &nbsp;As Constance began Blonde's torment by whipping
  her buttocks and thighs, I walked my father to the outer precincts of the harem. &nbsp;As
  we walked along he cautioned me not to be too brutal. &nbsp;I replied that
  he had engaged in honorable battle where success or failure was measured by
  who held the field of battle at the end of the day. &nbsp;I pointed out that
  I lived in a world of fear where at the end of the day you never knew where
  you stood. &nbsp;Only in the morning when you awoke to find that you had not
  been strangled in your sleep did you know that you had won the previous day. &nbsp;And
  that just entitled you to fight another day. &nbsp;Blonde never screamed that
  afternoon. &nbsp;That young woman had courage. &nbsp;By the time she passed
  out from loss of blood there were only six fruit left on the persimmon tree. &nbsp;Constanza
  cried all night. 
A week later my father declined to come to Constanza's circumcision party. 
Part VI � Constanza's Service 
And so it happened just as I planned it. &nbsp;After her infundibulation ,
  Constanza required only one further application of the red-hot knife before
  she was able to fellatio a dozen eunuchs of the Black Guard at one kneeling. &nbsp;They
  all agreed that she had a skill that no courtesan of the Jewish Quarter could
  equal. &nbsp;And Blonde made it her business to teach Constanza the most arousing
  amatory exclamations in the Turkish language. &nbsp;And Constanza's failings
  necessitated only one more whipping for Blonde. &nbsp;I even had my favorite
  eunuch teach Constanza to bring Blonde to sexual fulfillment. &nbsp;It served
  to remind Constanza of what she would be missing in life. 
Ten days after my period ended. &nbsp;That's when I set the appointment with
  Selim for. &nbsp;In the morning, immediately after he got up. &nbsp;We would
  bring his coffee to him. &nbsp;Constanza I had bathed and oiled. &nbsp;Her
  hair curled and beautifully spread. &nbsp;Her body naked except for the bounds
  that secured her elbows and wrists behind her back and held her ankles together. &nbsp;I
  had my eunuchs carrier her to Selim's favorite chamber. &nbsp;The shoddy one. &nbsp;She
  was so beautiful, naked, slim, fettered. &nbsp;I was not so bad looking myself,
  my breasts bared, my nipples and areolae rouged. &nbsp;But she was so beautiful
  I kissed her lips and stoked her breasts while we waited for Selim to appear. &nbsp;I
  kissed her nipples and called her a good girl. &nbsp;I promised her freedom
  if all went well. &nbsp;I promised her that she and Blonde could go back to
  the West, borne on my father's finest galley. 
Oh did she arouse my Pasha. &nbsp;She took his sex in her mouth. &nbsp;&nbsp;She
  kissed its head and licked its shaft. &nbsp;She sucked his testicles and tongued
  his anus. &nbsp;She aroused him as he had not been aroused in weeks, in months,
  maybe in years. &nbsp;He never thought of his hubble bubble. &nbsp;And then
  when he was at his peak of arousal, I sat astride him and took him into me. &nbsp;And
  he exploded inside me. &nbsp;And he pumped and he pumped and I sucked him dry
  by clenching my vaginal muscles. &nbsp;And then, as he was reaching for his
  hookah, she grabbed him by his manhood and with her lips brought him around
  again. &nbsp;She made it swell and took it deep into her throat. &nbsp;And
  he fucked her face. &nbsp;And then when he was once again fully aroused I mounted
  him again. &nbsp;And he came within me. &nbsp;He spoke not another word that
  whole day. &nbsp;And the next day we did it to him again in the early morning
  with the first beams of sunlight streaming into the room. &nbsp;It was ten
  months before I had another menstrual period. &nbsp;It was a month after Mahmoud
  was born. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Afterwards 
&nbsp;We tried to work our magic on him, Constanza and I upon Selim the Pasha. &nbsp;For
  a whole year. &nbsp;Until well after Mahmoud's first birthday. &nbsp;No use. &nbsp;Even
  Constanza could no longer arouse him. &nbsp;As far as his third and fourth
  wives. &nbsp;They couldn't even get in to see him. &nbsp;He loved only his
  water pipe. &nbsp;And that was the end of the story. &nbsp;I had my son spawned
  off the Pasha. &nbsp;Succession was assured and my cousin the Vizier was very
  happy. &nbsp;My father considered that he had spawned a wanton but took consolation
  that in my own field of battle I was as victorious as he was with his galleys. &nbsp;And
  being the grandfather of the next Pasha did not hurt too badly. 
Oh yes, there really was a Belmont. &nbsp;A minor prince of Southern Italy
  who came to Istanbul looking for a blond german girl. &nbsp;Offering a huge
  amount of money to anyone who would help him find her. &nbsp;Of course he had
  never met the lady and had only a locket with her picture, very crudely done. &nbsp;We
  had a merry time with him my cousin the Vizier and I. &nbsp;We bought a blond
  Serbian whore in the slave market for a few gold pieces who had learned a few
  phrases of German while a girl. &nbsp;We put her in the Black Palace and had
  the Vizier pretend he was the chief eunuch guard of the Pasha's Seraglio of
  the Sublime Porte. &nbsp;Belmont spent thousands of gold pieces before he abducted
  his strumpet from the eunuchs' quarters. &nbsp;He left Istanbul much richer
  and greatly amused. &nbsp;She fucked him to death somewhere in the Greek isles. &nbsp;He
  never realized that she had syphilis. &nbsp;He never even made it home to Naples. &nbsp;He
  did happy though insane with Lues . &nbsp;Have to give that to him, poor, deluded,
  insane but happy. 
Blonde did well. &nbsp;She was easily assimilated and is still with me. &nbsp;And
  her genitals are intact. &nbsp;Eventually she learned so much from my favorite
  eunuch that she supplanted him in my favor. &nbsp;My genitals are intact. &nbsp;I
  guess I am not a good pious Muslim girl. &nbsp;But I am the mother of the Pasha
  now and even at age 60 I enjoy having my clitoris and labia sucked. &nbsp;Blonde,
  once a year I give her a good whipping just to prove who is boss. &nbsp;Blond,
  you are fat but you are alive and happy and you serve me very well. &nbsp;Constanza
  unfortunately did not do well. &nbsp;She could never assimilate. &nbsp;When
  she heard about Belmont she went into a funk. &nbsp;Particularly when he took
  a whore rather than her and never knew the difference. &nbsp;Actually he was
  probably better off with the whore. &nbsp;When Mahmoud turned three years old
  we held a birthday party for him out in my favorite courtyard. &nbsp;Under
  the persimmon tree. &nbsp;We stripped her naked and skinned her alive. &nbsp;We
  slowly stripped the skin from her and tormented the underlying flesh with candle
  flames. &nbsp;We stuffed the hide later and sent it off to Naples to her prospective
  in laws. &nbsp;The ones that flayed the Turkish envoy. &nbsp;Except I kept
  enough skin to have a pair of gloves and a pair of slippers made. 
I guess I never mentioned that the envoy was my beloved brother. &nbsp;They
  say he died hard. &nbsp;Constanza died even harder because a Turkish woman
  is more patient than a bunch of Italian men.
