����������� Sabine
watched as the captive was dragged into the guardhouse, pulled across the step
by the short chain strung between rusted manacles.� The revolutionary was bloody; her hands and
knees and elbows had been scraped raw on the cobblestones as she was dragged to
the station, and the wound above her eye, where Sabine had struck her with the
carbine to end the shooting, still issued a stream of steady crimson.� Whoever she was, she�d been pretty once; not
a true beauty, but her hair was the color of summer wheat and her eyes glowed
like the sea on a cloudless day.� Her
face was smooth, her shoulders unbowed and hands uncalloused.� She was an old girl, or a young woman; some
spoiled guildsman�s brat, most likely, or a journeyman�s pampered toy.� Sabine, raised a
gutter brat, who had fought and bit and scratched for every scrap of food until
the Guard took her in, was disgusted.� 

����������� Stefan, who had been like a father to Sabine, who had taken her
under his tutelage, who had held secret her sex until she could prove her
place, was dead.� The woman�s last
shot � that desperate, flailing attack, brushed aside so easily � had struck
his throat.� Stefan hadn�t died
quickly.� Unable to speak, unable to stop
the blood, he had struggled uselessly against his fate while the Guard watched
helplessly.� 

����������� �She
will be questioned,� Sabine spat through clenched teeth.� �Take her to the back room.� Secure her.�

����������� The
revolutionary tried to gain her feet, intent upon marching with dignity to her
torture.� Sabine swung a heavy leather
boot around, connecting with the captive�s kneecap with a crunching sound.� The prisoner dropped again with a
whimper.� 

����������� �Crawl,
slut.� You don�t get to walk in the
footsteps of your betters.�

����������� Despite
the tears streaming down her cheeks, the woman looked up into Sabine�s
eyes.� �I won�t talk.� You�ll get nothing from me!�

����������� Sabine
stared back a moment; her chin length hair, black as midnight, fell forward to cover her face from all but the
prisoner.� A smile curved her full lips,
seductive in its cruelty, and hellfire lit her eyes with white flame.� Her voice was half Sabine, and half the demoness who hid within her soul.� �Oh darling,� she breathed softly, �I�m not
going to make you talk.� I�m going to
make you scream.�� 

&nbsp;

����������� Almost,
when Sabine walked towards the high, windowless chamber in the rear of the
guardhouse, almost they stopped her.� She
was young; sixteen was barely old enough to accompany patrols, and this was a
far more serious thing.� She was a woman;
the nest of virtues, of goodness, of redemption.� She was Sabine, like a daughter to them all,
or some tomboy sister.� But she was not that.� A look into her eyes and her fellow Guards
stepped aside.� Something within her had
broken, crumbled away from her soul to fall into the pits of Hell, and something
new had appeared as though the demoness within her
had drawn back a black curtain to reveal a part of Sabine untouched, unimagined
� and truly cruel.� 

����������� At first
she merely watched, content to let Guenther perform the role that had so often
in the past been his.� He was
professional; he was calm, and unmoved.� He
tied back his grey hair and rolled up his shirtsleeves, and set to work like a
dentist.� His breathing never changed, he
never looked away or let his brown-eyed gaze linger too long.� He dispassionately crushed things, and burned
them, and tore them apart with iron tongs and dull grey knives.� The captive � Petra �
began to talk, despite all her bravado.�
She lied, of course.� Guenther
listened to it all, making tiny, precise notations in a blood spattered
journal, and when the story was complete, he began again, and then again.� Each time, the story changed; details cannot
be remembered among the pain and stress, Guenther stated factually.� One simply cannot remember what to say.� The only way to get it right � the only way
to end the pain � was to tell the truth.�


����������� Finally,
that was what she did.� Her father was a factor;
he knew nothing of her involvement.� Her
brother had gotten her into the resistance, which he�d made contact with while
attending university.� Names followed;
associates, friends, and finally even family: her cousins, her parents, even
her younger sisters were implicated.�
Most of those were untrue, of course; by that point she would say anything
to stop the pain, to keep the fingers and teeth she still retained.� It was, as Guenther stated, almost an
alchemical formula: A certain resistance met with so much force yields
predictable and scientific results.� 

����������� At
first, Sabine watched in paralyzed horror, unable to look away but nauseous
from the smell of detached viciousness.�
She threw up repeatedly, until nothing was left in her stomach.� Then she was in rapture; as the captive
slowly became less and less human, it was�interesting�to watch the things done
to her.� New facets of behavior and
anatomy, secret and wicked ones, were opened to
her.� Finally, however, it was boring; it
left her unfulfilled, it left her seething and wanting.� It was too clinical; Guenther performed with
the emotion of someone writing out mathematical equations.� Finally he finished wiping down his tools, tucked away the velvet lined cases and rose to
leave.� Petra was
left tied to a heavy wooden chair in the center of the room.� 

����������� �What
will we do with her?� Sabine asked hesitantly.�
What do I want done with her?

����������� Guenther
shrugged.� �She broke easily; I have no
doubt she�ll survive to swing from the gallows tomorrow.�

����������� Petra looked
up at the words, tears appearing again.�
She seemed to cry quite often.� Sabine
watched her like a predator.� �And if not?�� 

����������� �The same fate.� No
one cares if she�s still wriggling on the line, as long as the people have a
corpse to show them justice is done.� Why
do you ask?�

����������� �Can I��� Sabine licked her
lips, and almost gave it up; but the demoness stirred
within her, and desire surged.� �Can I
play with her?� To learn your techniques,
I mean�I need to practice.�� 

����������� This
time it was Guenther who was taken aback by words; belatedly, Sabine realized
how horrible this duty was for him.� �Play�?� An interesting word.� I don�t think this anger is healthy for you,
Sabine.� I think it�s devouring you.� Your eyes�you�re not the same girl we snuck
in for drinks last night.�

����������� �I
need�I need to let it out.� The anger, I
mean.� She�she killed him, Guenther.� I need to do something.� �She wrung her hands, and watched Petra like a
kitten with a mouse, wondering if it would be allowed to pounce.� The captive, for her part, was struggling
anew, reeking of fear of a new assault.� 

����������� Guenther
paused, and a look of distaste crossed his face. ��Very well.� We�ve promised to teach you everything, after
all�and we need another Guard experienced with this.� By dawn you�ll have lost your appetite, and
I�d rather you regret this day forever than go out seeking what you think
you�ve missed.� This,� he sat down and reopened
the case of faded blue velvet to reveal rows of saws, knives and syringes, �is
a surgeon�s kit.�� 

����������� Petra began
to scream.

&nbsp;

����������� Guenther�s
instruction was brief, but complete.� He
detailed each tool in the kit, and Sabine learned he had once apprenticed as an
apothecary.� There were other tools as
well, ones no sane surgeon would use; some were clean and crisp enough they
hardly seemed worn, others were dotted with rust and
dulled from use.� She was told each name
and made to memorize them.� 

����������� She
learned their uses as well, although most of Guenther�s instruction was thinly
veiled instruction in the medical arts: how to draw blood with metal syringe,
as large as her two fists held together, and then how to inject a drug; how to
amputate a finger, using a large and very sharp curved knife; how to tourniquet
a larger limb and cleave it with a saw, severing it in a frenzy of motion lest
the writhing make the cut irregular.� 

����������� Petra
screamed at first, much louder than before; perhaps it made a difference in the
pain, to know the one inflicting it enjoys the game.� Perhaps it was the horror of false hope � of
having surrendered to gain peace, only to begin anew.� In any case, she screamed, until finally her
voice broke and all she could manage were ragged whimpers.� 

����������� Sabine
enjoyed it all.� She smiled with each
cut, grinning as her hands and chest and face were sprayed with viscous gore,
her eyes shining brighter with each moment.�
The smell was intoxicating, the miasma of blood, sweat, and�power.� The pain wouldn�t cure the hurt of losing
Stefan, but it balanced it; it found equivalency and the strain of the uneven
scales of justice ceased to pull at her heart.�
And more: with each motion she gained control, gained domination; the
woman beneath her moved as she wished, felt what she wanted, just so, begged
like a supplicant and�worshipped her, worshipped Sabine with every word, every
scream, every tear as the goddess of her small, horrible world.� 

����������� She
learned something, then, that Guenther didn�t teach: the true art of
torture.� It was one thing to inflict
pain, to see the reaction; it was cold and logical and rational.� But it was the difference between one who
paints wall, and one who paints portraits: the colors and tools were the same,
application of a certain tincture resulted in a predictable shade, yes, but the
artist creates something more: more than the mere sum of the palette, an
interwoven mastery that creates something new in the beholder, a more complete
and beautiful picture.� 

����������� Sabine
was an artist.

����������� She
learned, as she worked, the subtle twists and turns to affect her victim
precisely; she learned how to taunt Petra�s
mind, not just her body, and how to tear apart her soul though barely touching
her flesh.� Finally, she learned to make
her victim love her, to make her give her deepest thanks for every new
viciousness Sabine inflicted, knowing that it was better than what could have
been done.� Perhaps Hell, too, works on
equivalency, Sabine thought; and if a part of me has broken away and been cast
to the demons, they have paid the bargain with a bit of themselves to take its
place.� 

����������� She felt
the power, the excitement, as pleasure.�
With each new delight, each playful slice, she felt her wetness
grow.� As Petra
writhed in pain, so too did Sabine writhe in ecstatic shivers, until finally
the prisoner failed.� As Petra
screamed her last, her blood spilling across the floor, Sabine screamed with
the little death, collapsing as she shook with her first orgasm.� The succubus within her looked on and smiled.

&nbsp;

����������� When she
finally recovered, Sabine realized she was the only one in the room.� Guenther had left some time ago, with a deep
sigh and much muttering.� Petra�s body
was present, of course, but without its spirit to torment it was simply refuse
to be displayed tomorrow.� It would make
an impact: indeed, the soldiers of the revolution would remember it for many
years to come, and speak of the �Bloody Fourth� guardhouse as a precinct to be
avoided at all costs, or avenged.� 

����������� For the
moment, however, only one thing seemed important.� Sabine smiled wickedly as she wiped away the
wetness that had flowed down her thighs.�


����������� �It�s
time to fetch your sisters, love.�
