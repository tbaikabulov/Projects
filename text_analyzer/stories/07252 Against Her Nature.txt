*****This was the first story I ever wrote. I know its not in the best format, but I've decided I wanted to leave it be instead of&nbsp; virtually changing the story as I try to make it more organized.&nbsp; I think it has its own charm in being a story of a new writer and I wanted to let it stay that way. I'd love to hear what you think!*****


 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It was a typical day.&nbsp; Well not so typical.&nbsp; I was going to see Master.&nbsp; And not only for a few hours.&nbsp; ALL DAY.&nbsp; It had been awhile since he had been able to dedicate a whole day to me-- Since we had even seen each other at all.&nbsp; We had been only talking over the computer.&nbsp; No fun at all.&nbsp; Between classes, research papers, work-- it had just seemed like an endless array of reasons to keep us apart.&nbsp; Not that he didn't try.&nbsp; Master always made it clear that he wanted to be with me and wished he could spend more time on me, and my lessons as well.&nbsp; Seeing as such I took extra care to please him.&nbsp; My hair was straight, I was in a comfortable low cut jean shorts and a new top.&nbsp; The top was slightly risky.&nbsp; It had a strap behind the neck to hold it up, showed a teasing amount of cleavage, and zippered up the front.&nbsp; I shuddered as i imagined him slowly pulling that zipper down-- I could NOT wait for him to get here.&nbsp; "I must try to be patient" I thought.&nbsp; I turned on the radio.&nbsp; "Having trouble staying aroused?&nbsp; Talk to Doc"--next channel-- "Single Men and Women in YOUR AREA!!!"-- NEXT Channel-- "Are you in need of sex?&nbsp; Look no more, just call"-- I slammed the power button for the radio.&nbsp; "Bloody hell," I mumbled, "the one time i actually Try to behave, all I can find are sex ads..just my luck."&nbsp; And then I heard it-- the rumbling of Master's very Loud engine.&nbsp; Bloody noisy thing.&nbsp; But Master was here!!!!!&nbsp; I sprinted to the door making sure I looked at least slightly composed before I opened the door for Master.&nbsp; He looked amazing.&nbsp; It always astounded me how gorgeous he was.&nbsp; I could just sit and stare at him for hours.&nbsp; And his eyes!!&nbsp; There was always so much adoration and depth in them-- they were eyes you could lose yourself in.&nbsp; I cannot count the times I forgot what I was saying because of them.&nbsp; He smiled when he saw me.&nbsp; He liked what he saw.&nbsp; "Score one for me", I thought.&nbsp; "Hello love," he said as he wrapped his arms around me.&nbsp; I savored the feeling of being in his arms again.&nbsp; He kissed the top of my head as he said, "Its been too long babe, I'm sorry.&nbsp; I've missed you."&nbsp; "It Had been a long time", I thought as i kissed his neck.&nbsp; His neck's so sensitive.&nbsp; I've missed him so much.&nbsp; "Come on babe, let's go," he said. He put his hand on the small of my back as he guided me to his truck.&nbsp; He opened the door for me.&nbsp; "Always the gentleman," i thought with a smile.&nbsp; "Thanks".&nbsp; "Of course," he said.&nbsp; "Melody........." I lowered my eyes as he said this. My Name.&nbsp; Melody.&nbsp; "Let the games begin," I thought with a small smile.&nbsp; "Mel look at me".&nbsp; His eyes were kind, and shone of love.&nbsp; "I want you to look me in the eye all day--- do you understand?"&nbsp; "Yes, Master," I said, slightly confused.&nbsp; Our first lesson together popped in my head.&nbsp; It had been pitch dark, close to midnight at the docks.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Do you know what a trigger word is?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Yes"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Yours will be "Melody".&nbsp; Once I have said it you will not, I repeat you will NOT make eye contact.&nbsp; You will answer any question i ask you followed by "Master".&nbsp; Do you understand?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Yes, Master."
Now why had he changed the rules? I Liked rules. If i listened to them and obeyed Master was happy.&nbsp; I knew my place.&nbsp; I understood what to do.&nbsp; But know he was taking away the rules, my soft securities.&nbsp; Seeing my confused face, Master said "I'm not the ONLY master tonight."&nbsp; Ok, even more confused!!!!&nbsp; Was that supposed to explain this to me at all?!?!?!&nbsp; "Master, I don't understand."&nbsp; "You will love, have patience. Have trust," he said.&nbsp; "I DO trust you Master-- you must know that," I pleaded.&nbsp; "I do little one," he said, "Your trust in Me has never been in question.&nbsp; It's yourself.&nbsp; You must learn to trust yourself and know your own limits.&nbsp; I know them but it's important that you do as well."&nbsp; With this he leaned over and kissed my forehead as he started his beat up truck leaving me much to think over.&nbsp; 


As we arrived at Master's house I was no longer confused. Well.... I was still Very confused-- but decided not to let it matter because Master knew what he was doing-- if i didn't exactly understand, then I would just wait until whatever Master had planned for the day was unveiled.&nbsp; As we walked through his house he turned me in the direction of his bedroom.&nbsp; "No tea first", i thought, we Always have tea...." I admonished myself in my head--"Stupid, stop questioning him!!!!&nbsp; Do you want to displease him again?!&nbsp; Master knows what he's doing-- if he doesn't want to have than he doesn't want to have tea!"&nbsp; With this, unknowing of the heated argument going on inside me, Master opened the door-- and what I saw.......... I couldn't believe it. There was a girl.&nbsp; Naked.&nbsp; "Ok," I thought, "Master had gone utterly senile."&nbsp; The minuscule part of my brain that Wasn't simply frozen in shock took in the situation.&nbsp; "Ok....there is a beautiful, naked girl calmly lounged on Master's bed, blindfolded.&nbsp; No wait.. theres a chain attached to her delicate collar....she's chained to the bed...hum.. Her skin looked smooth to the touch and shiny.&nbsp; She had straight, shoulder length Jet black hair.... but what on earth was she doing here?", i thought.&nbsp; Master had been watching me with a critical eye, judging my reactions.&nbsp; I looked at him, with thousands of questions showing through my eyes.&nbsp; "Master?", was all i said.&nbsp; "She's yours, Pet, for as long as you'd like her--today.&nbsp; I told you you must learn your abilities--- this is your time-- I will stay, but this is your show love." With that he dug in his pocket and handed me the key to our toy box---"The key," i thought...i had never handled it before...Master was serious when he said this was my show.&nbsp; I gulped trying to drown my nerves.&nbsp; "Pick three toys", he said, "You will be allowed any three of your choice."&nbsp; I went slowly to out box.. I had never been allowed inside before... As I sorted through the array of toys I took out the deep purple velvet rope, a slender feather, and my own collar.&nbsp; I was happy with the knowledge that mine was thinner than hers, and that my Master has picked it out specifically for me.&nbsp; As Master saw the toys I chose, his face lifted in question at the sight of my collar.&nbsp; I strode gently over to his desk and found paper-- I didn't want That Girl to hear my conversation with Master... especially if I was supposed to dominate her... "How on earth would I be able to?!" i thought panicking.&nbsp; "Please Master, it will make be feel better....I'm very nervous," i wrote.&nbsp; "Of course Mel....this is only for you." he replied.&nbsp; I lifted my hair to allow Master to clip on my collar.&nbsp; He kissed my neck before motioning for me to begin.&nbsp; I knew I had to start.&nbsp; I picked the rope and hesitantly went towards the bed.&nbsp; I knew i had to attach her arms and legs to the bed posts.....I had no idea how to tie the knots properly though!! I looked beseechingly at Master before i returned to the desk.&nbsp; "Please Master, guide me. I can not do this alone." With that Master took the rope from my hands and led me to the bed.&nbsp; At his motion, I held the girl's arm up towards the bed post.&nbsp; Master motioned for me to watch as he slowly tied the intricate knot.&nbsp; I moved to grab her other arm but Master stopped me--he picked up the rope and handed it to me.&nbsp; I bit my lip as i began the intricate knot--- wrap around, twist, pull through, make a loop--- I forgot where the loop when next-- I looked up at Master questioningly and&nbsp; he pointed to the correct place.&nbsp; I smiled glowingly up at him as i completed the knot correctly.&nbsp; He nodded his approval as he went to tie her ankle-- I had to tie her other one, which again, took Much longer than it took Master, but i managed it without his help this time.&nbsp; 


She was now spread eagle.&nbsp; Looking down at her, I felt no desire.&nbsp; I didn't want to do this-- but Master wanted me too.&nbsp; I placed my hand lightly on her stomach and skimmed over her hip-- my hand hovered, unsure of myself.&nbsp; As soon as i broke contact she moaned.&nbsp; I froze at the sound of it-- I was torn between the overwhelming urge to beg Master to let me stop, that I would learn my abilities another way-- and the always underlaying knowledge that this is what Master wished and that I should obey him and do my best to please him.&nbsp; She arched to try to gain contact with me again.&nbsp; I bit my lip trying to force myself to obey Master.&nbsp; He loved me so much, I wanted to obey him and learn.&nbsp; I slowly bent to pick up the feather I had unceremoniously left on the floor.&nbsp; With a shaking had I traced it lightly over the tender underside of her arm.&nbsp; This time she arched to try and move Away from the sensation.&nbsp; I continued moving it down her body until i reached the smooth, slim insides of her thighs.&nbsp; She groaned again and arched, this time in attempt to move Away from the sensation.&nbsp; I swayed at the sound.&nbsp; Master grabbed my sides to steady me.&nbsp; He looked at me with concern in his lovely eyes.&nbsp; I met his eyes, mine showing the despair at being unable to continue with his task.&nbsp; In a soft voice he said, "This has only been for your education-- you may stop at any time-- have you learned anything about yourself?"&nbsp; "Yes-- I'm not enjoying this--trying to dominate her-- please don't make me continue Master.&nbsp; I have tried to trust my judgment.&nbsp; I pushed myself and found my limit," I replied.&nbsp; "Then the game is done for tonight, Pet. I'm very proud of you. You did very well.&nbsp; I knew you were apprehensive yet you tried,&nbsp; and even pushed yourself to do better.&nbsp; This pleases me very much". With this he cut the rope holding That girl down leaving her to finish freeing herself Master told me later that She was a friend of his and didn't mind the Task he had set up for me or that we had left her unsatisfied--&nbsp; Master led me down the dark hallway into the beautiful room he has set aside for when i was there and proceeded to kiss me as never before.&nbsp; It seemed an eternity before he lifted his head, and then only a hair. "Master?" I asked, wondering if i had such luck.&nbsp; With a grin Master said, "I may have said the games were over for tonight Mel Love....but there's no way I'm finished with you," and with that dropped his head back to me as I feel into deep waves of pleasure.......
