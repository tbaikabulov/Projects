So Who&#8217;s the Bitch Now?

My time reading stories here on BDSM Lib has given me a keen insight into my own personality.&nbsp; I have found out where my interests lie.&nbsp; For a long time I couldn&#8217;t understand, because of my sexual proclivities, why I like humiliating women.&nbsp; Until I realised that I am turned on by consensual humiliation and degradation not mine, mind you, but of others. Non-consensual anything leaves me cold and angry, so I understand the willing slave mindset and also enjoy reading those tales of revenge for infidelity, cold calculated deceit must be punished, if at all possible by humiliation.&nbsp; I hope you all enjoy this tale of discovery.&nbsp; I have many more in the pipeline!


Tiffany sat back in her plush office chair and flicked through the folder she was holding.&nbsp; It just didn&#8217;t make sense; all the information was there, but it led nowhere.&nbsp; The paper trail, as they say, hadn&#8217;t just vanished, it appears that it was never there in the first place.&nbsp; Leaning forward she pressed the intercom on her phone, �Yes Ms Carmichael?�

�Can you send Vivian in please Sabrina?�

�I&#8217;ll send her in right away Ms Carmichael!�

�Thank you Sabrina.�&nbsp;&nbsp; Tiffany heard a giggle as she disconnected.

Tiffany sat back again and pondered her next move; with the security audit only days away, this latest development had her feeling very uneasy.&nbsp; There was a knock at the door, before it opened and an attractive woman in her early thirties entered.&nbsp; She was wearing a very short navy blue mini skirt, a thin pale blue blouse with no bra, black stay-up stockings and five inch heels.

 Vivian, her long blonde locks falling in loose curls down around her face, entered and stood obsequiously bowed head in front of Tiffany&#8217;s desk for a moment, then without saying a word she started to unbuttoning her blouse, pulling the lapels aside to reveal a nice firm pair of C cup breasts, her newly pierced nipples were standing proud and hard, if a little swollen.

Tiffany noticed, �So Sabrina came through on her threat and got your nipples pierced?�

Vivian just nodded, still gazing at the floor, making the ridiculously tacky hoop earrings wiggle either side of her head.&nbsp; She coaxed her skirt up until it was bunched around her waist, revealing no panties and a bare shaved pussy.&nbsp; Her face flushed a bright crimson as she went through her routine that hadn&#8217;t change much in almost three months.&nbsp; Her embarrassment doubled by the glistening sheer of moisture slipping down her inner thighs.

Her face felt as hot as a blast furnace as she dropped to her knees.&nbsp; Crawling in under Tiffany&#8217;s desk, she watched as her boss spread her legs.&nbsp; Tiffany&#8217;s clean shaven pussy was also without panties, giving immediate access to her nether lips.&nbsp; Vivian shuddered and closed her eyes; the sexual excitement she felt was the only thing that prevented her from throwing up in revulsion.&nbsp; She hated and loathed every humiliating second of her servitude, at the same time revelling in the sexual haze that same humiliation offered.&nbsp; She more than understood that she was here of her own doing.

What confused and perplexed her was why this demeaning ritual gave her cause to be turned on, so horny that her pussy constantly leaked?&nbsp; Now to be under the desk she used to work at and being used in such a fashion almost made her cum without even touching herself. Taking a deep breath she kissed the pussy lips in front of her and got down to the business that she had been called in for.

As Tiffany felt the first brush of Vivian&#8217;s talented tongue on her inflamed pussy lips, she thought back to the events that had brought them to this point in time.

~...~

A knock on the door caught Vivian&#8217;s attention, �Come in!�

Tiffany opened the door to her boss&#8217;s office and entered, with a folder in her nervous right hand.&nbsp; Vivian looked up momentarily then went back to the report that had her interest before Tiffany&#8217;s entry into her office.&nbsp; After a short while she enquired, �Yes Tiffany, what do you want?�

Tiffany was a little worried with what she had to say, and not quite sure how it would be accepted, �Ummm, I&#8217;ve finished going through the accounts as you asked last night.&nbsp; I spent almost four hours reorganising and refiling them as you requested Ma&#8217;am!�

Tiffany was ten years Vivian&#8217;s junior, pretty, verging on gorgeous and that gave her , her pick of men.&nbsp; The silky auburn hair cascading down past her shoulders added to her allure.&nbsp; Her intelligence and insightfulness allowed her to finish college at the head of her class in business studies.&nbsp; This pointless task had annoyed her as being an economic and managerial waste of her talents.

Vivian frowned, �So?&nbsp; What do you want; a medal?&nbsp; Just do your damn job properly the next time and stop fraternising with the guys in the mail room, or you wouldn&#8217;t be in the position of having to do unnecessary and unpaid overtime!�&nbsp; Vivian was hard on her employees, never giving an inch and demanding more and more.&nbsp; The staff nicknamed her the Bitch Boss or BB for good reason.

Tiffany suddenly broke, �I&#8217;m beginning to wonder why you hired me Ms Donohue?&nbsp; You, Ms Donohue, would have to be apart from doltish; the nastiest, and the most unappreciative boss I have ever had the misfortune of working for in my entire life!�

�Compliments will get you nowhere Tiffany!&nbsp; That statement wouldn&#8217;t be hard to beat, since you most certainly haven&#8217;t put an honest damned day&#8217;s work in here since I bloody well hired you!�

Tiffany stiffened, her dander had risen past all thought of keeping her job, all the angst she&#8217;d felt since coming to work for Dynamics came flooding out and she pulled her shoulders back with a defiant stance, �That&#8217;s not true and you know fucking well know it, you ungrateful bitch!�&nbsp; Tiffany took a deep breath to calm herself, �I don&#8217;t think you&#8217;re a very nice person Vivian!&nbsp; You know what I think?&nbsp; Something or someone has put a giant burr up your arse and you&#8217;re taking it out on everyone else!�

�My name is Ms Donohue to you little missy, and what you think doesn&#8217;t even register on my care meter.&nbsp; Care factor zero!&nbsp; And if I get anymore grief out of you, you&#8217;ll be looking for work elsewhere.&nbsp; Now get out of my office, and go do what I pay you for.�

Tiffany had had enough, �Clare was right, you need someone to bring you down a peg or two.�

�What Clare or any other of those cackling hens out there think is of no interest to me.&nbsp; If Clare has an issue with how I run this business, let her bring her dyke arse in here and we&#8217;ll sort her out too.�

Tiffany ground her teeth, �I think that&#8217;s the most sexist remark I have ever heard!&nbsp; Just because you&#8217;re a damn homophobe, doesn&#8217;t give you the right to insult Clare like that.&nbsp; She&#8217;s a damn hard worker, kind and caring person and her sexual interests shouldn&#8217;t be brought into question.�

Vivian leaned back in her chair and shot Tiffany an icy stare, �What the hell has got into you that you&#8217;ve suddenly decide to grow a fucking backbone?�

Tiffany threw the folder onto Vivian&#8217;s desk, �You might want to take a quick gander at that!&nbsp; As I said, I spent almost four hours here after work.&nbsp; Three of those unpaid hours were taken up trying to work out where every bit of that inventory has gone.�

Vivian opened the folder and flicked through to reports �You&#8217;ll notice they all have your signature on them.&nbsp; But there&#8217;s nothing in billing or consignment that corresponds with those invoices.&nbsp; I think you&#8217;ll agree that it looks awfully suspiciously like fraud, embezzlement and if I&#8217;m not mistaken with the sensitivity of the merchandise and clientele we trade with, it may also be a case of treason?�

Tiffany could see Vivian blanch visibly, and snap the folder shut, �What are you going to do with this?�

Tiffany smiled wickedly and conceived, �Got you, you bitch!�&nbsp; She folded her arms, �It&#8217;s not what I&#8217;m going to do, but it&#8217;s what I have already done Vivian that you should be more worried about!�

Vivian scanned the young woman&#8217;s face for weakness or uncertainly and found none, �Ok then, what have you done?�

Tiffany smile widened appreciatively, �I dare say you know a man by the name of Trent Bartholomew?�

Tiffany was pleased to see Vivian stiffen at the name, �What have you told Trent?

�Let&#8217;s put it this way Viv my sweetie.&nbsp; Get your scraggy arse out of my chair and on your knees here in front of me!�

Vivian&#8217;s face reddened, no one here had ever spoken to her like that ever, �You have got to be kidding?&nbsp; If you think that I&#8217;m going to bow down to you missy, then hell will have to freeze over first!�

Tiffany moved her hand to the phone, �When I spoke to Trent this morning before I came in here, he wasn&#8217;t happy to hear his prize pupil and President of his company is a thief, fraudster, and maybe even a terrorist sympathiser.&nbsp; I was going to hand you over to the authorities, but he asked me to keep this in house and I can understand his reasons.&nbsp; The damage this could do to Dynamics Inc would just about cripple the company and I happen to agree. So how about we call Mr Bartholomew and ask him what the weather conditions are like in hell?&nbsp; I&#8217;m sure the temperature will drop a few more degrees if you make the call.�&nbsp; Tiffany held the hand piece out for Vivian to use.

Vivian glared daggers at Tiffany for some seconds and then grabbed the phone, slamming it back down on it cradle, �NO!�&nbsp; She stared at the young upstart, but the realisation in her face made Tiffany&#8217;s smile turn to a smirk, �I&#8217;m sorry but no...I ...I don&#8217;t think that will be necessary.&nbsp; What is it you want...Money?&nbsp; I can give you a promotion and a raise in salary to go along with it, whatever you want!�

Tiffany folded her arms and fixed Vivian with a contemptuous stare, �I&#8217;m going for the promotion for sure and the raise, but it&#8217;s not you giving it to me as some payoff.&nbsp; I told you bitch!&nbsp; Get out of MY chair and get out here on your fucking knees!�

Vivian heart beat heavy in her cheats and she could feel her face heat up as blood rushed up the side of her neck to her cheeks, she slowly rose and sidled slowly around her desk, ending up in front of Tiffany, �You won&#8217;t get away with this.�

Tiffany slapped Vivian moderately hard across the face, �If you know what&#8217;s good for you then you hadn&#8217;t better talk to me or anyone else in this company like that ever again.&nbsp; Your arse is mine sweetie and I&#8217;ll be running it into the carpet every chance fucking I get.&nbsp; Now strip and we&#8217;ll get this job status transfer under way.�&nbsp; As she finished, Tiff waltzed around to the other side of her new desk and sat in her comfortable chair.

Vivian stood dumbfounded, �You want what?�

Tiffany was rearranging things on her desk to her liking and looked up, �Are you deaf as well as dumb, woman?&nbsp; I said strip and make it fast, I don&#8217;t want a striptease show, just get those rags off!�

Vivian was visibly shaken by her request, �No matter what I&#8217;ve done, you have no right to do this?�

Tiffany sat back in her chair and interlaced her fingers on top of her head, swivelling her chair from side to side, �Au contraire mademoiselle!&nbsp; For a brunette you sure think like the atypical dumb blonde slut!&nbsp; I think first thing tomorrow we will to have your hair bleached, to suit your mental acuity.�

Tiffany pushed forward and grabbed the folder and waved it at Viv, �Your arsehole attitude to the entire staff and this folder gives me every right to do as I please.&nbsp; If you had been even a half way decent boss, then we wouldn&#8217;t be having this confrontation.&nbsp; Now get your fucking clothes off before you find yourself talking to the police and their fraud squad!�

Tiffany could see the struggle Vivian was having with herself, but finally she dropped her head in defeat and started to unbutton her herringbone suit coat, taking it off she looked around to see where she could lay it.

�Just throw it in the corner.&nbsp; You won&#8217;t be putting it back on any time soon!� Tiffany snapped.

Vivian&#8217;s face was getting redder by the minute from embarrassment as she pulled her silk blouse from her slacks and fidgeted with the buttons. It ended up on her coat, and she hesitated, standing in front of a staring Tiffany, waiting for her to unzip her slacks.

�Nice bra!&nbsp; Victoria Secrets, does it come with matching panties?�

As Vivian&#8217;s slacks hit the floor Tiffany let out an amusing giggle, �Just as I thought, I figured you for French Cut knickers.&nbsp; You&#8217;re too damn stuck up to be wearing a thong!�

Vivian had a tear forming in her eye, and wiped it away, �Awww...are we embarrassed to be standing in our former office half naked?�

Vivian sniffed and nodded pathetically, �Please don&#8217;t do this Tiffany, it&#8217;s humiliating!�

Tiffany giggled, �That it is my sweetie, but not for me, now finish the show.�

Vivian reached behind her and unsnapped her bra, just letting it fall to the floor.&nbsp; All the fight had been taken out of her as tears fell from her face, �You haven&#8217;t finished bitch!�

Hooking her thumbs into her panties she bent and pulled them down off her hips.&nbsp; Tiffany watched as Vivian stood there in front of her stark naked, trying desperately to cover as much of her dignity with her hands as she could, �Drop the hands and give me a look at the bare facts.�&nbsp; Tiffany giggled hilariously at her own joke.

�What are your measurements?&nbsp; How tall are you?�

Vivian fixed her eyes on the leg of the desk, unable to look her tormentor in the eye, �I&#8217;m five ten...thirty four C, twenty four, thirty six.�

�Tiffany appraised the naked form in front of her, �You know for a pretty woman, what age are you?&nbsp; Twenty nine, thirty?�

�Thirty five!� responded a sobbing Vivian.

Tiffany raised her eyebrow, �Thirty five!&nbsp; I&#8217;m impressed, you don&#8217;t look it.&nbsp; For the life of me I can&#8217;t see how a physically beautiful thirty five year old woman can be so damn ugly on the inside.&nbsp; Well I&#8217;m going to fix that, consider this an intrinsic makeover!�

Tiffany pressed the intercom button on the phone, �Yes Ms Donohue?�

�This is Tiffany here Sabrina!&nbsp; Do you still have that hideous spandex number you showed me, you know the one you bought for the Pimps and Hookers ball this Friday night?�

�Yes I do, it&#8217;s in my locker.&nbsp; Why are you asking?�&nbsp; Tiffany could hear the cautious tenor in Sabrina&#8217;s voice.&nbsp; Sabrina had been hauled over the coals on more than one occasion for shopping in her lunch hour, even though she hadn&#8217;t spent any longer than her allotted time, and was always back before her hour was up.

�Don&#8217;t worry your pretty little head about it Sabbie, just go get it and bring it into the office if you will.�

Vivian&#8217;s eyes opened wide, �Ohhh please no Tiff, please don&#8217;t let her come in here and see me like this.�&nbsp; Vivian was shaking with nervous embarrassment at the thought of being caught naked in her office.

�Tiffany snapped, �Shut your mouth, and stand still.&nbsp; From now on it&#8217;s Ms Carmichael to you.&nbsp; In fact from now on you will be address everyone here by their surnames!�

Vivian stood shaking from the sheer tension and let out a cry of anguish to the sound of a knock and then the door opening.&nbsp; Sabrina was holding a garish lime green tube dress and she gasped, �Ohhh my god!&nbsp; What&#8217;s going on in here?�

Tiffany giggled at Sabrina&#8217;s reaction, �Just a little hostile takeover Sabbie, I have decided that this bitch no longer deserves to be the boss of this organisation.&nbsp; Isn&#8217;t that right bitch?�

Vivian was hanging her head trying to become invisible, �Yes Ms Carmichael!�

Sabrina giggled at Vivian, �So why is she standing naked in her office?�

Tiffany nonchalantly replied, �It isn&#8217;t her office any longer Sabbie, she has been demoted to all round gopher and office toy. I now own this, bitch mind, body and soul!�

Sabrina got over her initial shock as she walked around inspecting Vivian&#8217;s feminine charms, �Really?&nbsp; You&#8217;re shitting me! What has she done to put her bitchy arse in your hands?� 

Tears were falling from Vivian&#8217;s face, and Tiffany grinned wickedly, �That my secret and all you have to know is that she will now be doing my bidding.�

�Hmmm, nice firm tits!�&nbsp; She squeezed them for pliability, tweaking the nipples she commented, �These babies are the longest nipples I have ever seen!&nbsp; Is it cold in here or are my eyes deceiving me?&nbsp; I do believe she&#8217;s getting turned on by all this!�

Vivian winced and tried to pull back, but Sabrina only clamped down harder on her nipple causing pain to shoot up her breast to her neck. �Keep still bitch!�&nbsp; She grabbed a handful of Vivian&#8217;s pubic hair and tugged, making her cry out and grab Sabrina&#8217;s hand to relieve the pain. Sabrina tugged harder, �Get your filthy hands off mine!�

Vivian reluctantly let go and brought her hands back behind her.&nbsp; Slipping a finger between Vivian&#8217;s pussy lips, she commented, �Nope!&nbsp; The temperature in here is good, she horny and leaking like a sieve!�&nbsp; Vivian&#8217;s face flushed bright crimson at this latest statement and her eyes rolled back and fluttered.&nbsp; Vivian couldn&#8217;t help herself and she started cumming all over Sabrina&#8217;s finger. Her legs almost gave way under her and she sagged visibly.

�You god damn pitiful slag, you&#8217;ve just come all over my hand!�

Sabrina turned to Tiffany, �Did you see that?&nbsp; The bitch is a whore from head to toe.�

Tiffany was giggling too much to answer, and Sabrina continued, �I do believe this will have to go Boss.� Going back to pluck a few stray hairs she quipped, �I take it the dress is for her, and if so don&#8217;t want to be staring at a hairy beaver while she&#8217;s wearing the slut dress.�

�I do believe your right Sabbie.� Looking at Vivian&#8217;s dramatic sobbing, �There&#8217;s going to be some interesting changes around here.&nbsp; Getting your hair dyed and a full wax on that mangy cunt of yours will be your first act of contrition!�

Vivian went to object until Sabrina slapped her face hard, then folded her arms and giggled, �You know I was just about to hand in my resignation, but now I see this, I think I might just hang around a little longer.�&nbsp; She turned to Tiffany, �That is if I&#8217;m offered better pay and conditions?�

Tiffany was crunching a sheath of paper up in her hands.&nbsp; She grinned and threw it at Vivian, who shied away as it hit her in the face, �Count on it Sabrina.&nbsp; If fact everyone will be getting a pay rise this week, and as far as conditions are concerned.&nbsp; How would you like running this piece of shit around the office, go for starters?�

The look on Sabrina&#8217;s face froze Vivian to the core, �Ohhh fucking hell!&nbsp; Like just don&#8217;t cover it Tiff, love would be more like it!&nbsp; I&#8217;d almost give up my raise for that privilege. �

Tiffany burst out laughing, �Well don&#8217;t sweat the raise Sabbie, that&#8217;s a given.&nbsp; And I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ll find some interesting job&#8217;s for our little toy here.&nbsp; As long as we keep this in house and off the street, then we have carte blanche to do as we want with her skanky arse!&nbsp; Hand her your dress, I want to see what she looks like in her new role.�

Vivian took the dress for one reason only, and that was to atleast cover her nudity.&nbsp; She doubted that it was going to be any better for her self-esteem.&nbsp; Tiffany and Sabrina watched with perverted interest as Vivian slipped the gaudy material over her head.&nbsp; It was a slight struggle as the material clung to her breasts and refused to cooperate in sliding down over her twin peaks.

Finally getting it settled in place only brought new humiliating frustrations for Vivian.&nbsp; Sabrina had bought the dress for herself, and she was a good six inches shorter than Vivian&#8217;s Five ten.&nbsp; Every time she pulled it down to more modestly cover her pussy, it pulled over her breasts and threatened to reveal her nipples, not to mention that it was so tight that every curve was clearly visible, that included her very erect nipples.

�I can&#8217;t wear this, it too small, I&#8217;ll show everything I have!�&nbsp; She mumbled.

Both Tiffany and Sabrina giggled, and Tiffany replied with gleeful malice, �That&#8217;s the whole point, you stupid moron!&nbsp; I think we&#8217;ll have to hand out sunglasses to everyone in the office Sabbie; the slut&#8217;s headlights will be permanently on high beam!�

Tiffany giggled, �Get used to it bitch, because it&#8217;s not going to get any better from here on in, now get out of here.�

As Vivian turned to leave Tiffany remembered at the last minute, �There&#8217;s a parcel to go out this morning as well, take it down to the mail room.&nbsp; I promised Tom, Dick and Harry if they got it out on time, they&#8217;d be getting a special treat.�

Sabrina frowned, �I thought those pimply faced geeks that work in the mailroom are Kevin, Dan, and Kyle?&nbsp; Have they been replaced?�

Tiffany shrugged nonchalantly, �Not that I know of, I just can&#8217;t remember their names, and this slut will be letting any Tom, Dick, Harry get between her slut legs on our say so from now on!�

�Sabrina burst into a fit of giggles, as Tiffany dismissed Vivian with a wave of her hand, �Now get your slut arse out to your new desk and get to work, I also want that load you so gratefully left me to do, done by the finished of business today.&nbsp; See how you like being slave driven in a salt mine!�

With Tiffany and Sabrina smirking atrociously, Vivian turned dejectedly and headed out her one time office door with a wet face from tears, and wet inner thighs from something she didn&#8217;t want to think about.&nbsp; Sitting down in Tiffany&#8217;s old hard seat, Vivian admonished herself for ever getting herself into this situation and absentmindedly stroked her exposed slit.&nbsp; Her heart rate increased, as she brought herself to another body shaking orgasm, �What the fuck was I thinking?�

Tiffany offered Sabrina a chair, �We need to go over how to deal with that bitch!�

Sabrina nodded, �I agree, but I want to know just what you have on her that made her capitulate so totally.&nbsp; Fuck me dead!&nbsp; She&#8217;s damn well destroyed; we could have her turning tricks on Main Street, then have her thanking us for the privilege!�

Tiffany giggled, �Don&#8217;t tempt me!&nbsp; Just understand that I have the backing of Mr Bartholomew where Vivian&#8217;s concerned.&nbsp; I want you to send her down to payroll and tell Clare to increase everyone&#8217;s pay rate by ten percent.&nbsp; Since I now have her salary and she mine, I want hers cut by the same amount!�

�Ohhh my fucking god!&nbsp; She&#8217;s really fucked up by pissing you off, hasn&#8217;t she?&nbsp; Clare is going to cream her panties when she finds out about this.&nbsp; You know the bitch made Clare&#8217;s life a misery with her constant taunts about her sexual preferences.� Sabrina cackled.

Tiffany&#8217;s face hardened, �I know and I intend to give Clare her revenge.&nbsp; That&#8217;s only the start of it.&nbsp; She&#8217;s made enemies of us all; we&#8217;ve busted our arses to do her bidding.&nbsp; I know I have, thinking it would all be appreciated, but that bitch just demanded more and caned me if I didn&#8217;t deliver.&nbsp; Well her arse is in my sling now, and I intend to see to it that it gets thoroughly reamed by everyone.�

Sabrina shook her head, �Remind me never to piss you off Tiff!�

Tiffany giggled, �No chance of that sweetie, I&#8217;m a good boss and as long as everyone does a fair days work, then I&#8217;m happy to hand out the compliments when they excel.&nbsp; There are some interesting little perks in the pipeline and that slut isn&#8217;t going to like any one of them.�

Sabrina&#8217;s eyebrow rose in query, �Ohhh really!&nbsp; And what might they be?�

Tiffany studied Sabrina for a minute, �What are your feelings toward Clare and her sexual proclivities?�

Sabrina&#8217;s face turned dark, �What are you getting at?�

It confused Sabrina when Tiffany smiled wickedly, �I&#8217;m not intimating that you have any lesbian tendencies sweetie, I just want to know if you&#8217;re cool with Clare and her feeling for women sexually.�

Sabrina cleared her throat, �Well in that case I can assure you that I have no problem with Clare in any fashion, she a nice person.&nbsp; I get along with her and she doesn&#8217;t force herself on me or any of the other women working here.&nbsp; In fact we all get along with her wonderfully, except that piece shit out there!�

Tiffany pondered Sabrina&#8217;s statement as Sabrina continued, �I have to admit that I have wondered from time to time, and more recently what it would feel like to have her head between my legs.&nbsp; The only problem I have with that is; I really couldn&#8217;t see myself reciprocating the favour.&nbsp; It&#8217;s just not my cup of tea!�

Tiffany nodded her agreement, �As I thought, and to put your mind at ease, I&#8217;ve wondered the same thing.&nbsp; Might be a thrill finding out; don&#8217;t you think?�

Sabrina&#8217;s face was now a mask of malice, �You could be onto something here!&nbsp; And we wouldn&#8217;t have to return the favour.&nbsp; I know Clare would be over the moon about it, no telling what that woman will get the bitch to do for her.�

Tiffany sat forward in her chair and crossed her arms on the desk, nestling her chin on them, tapping the manicured nails of her right hand on the desk top, and pondering the myriad of scenarios she could bring down on the bitches head, �The possibilities are endless you know!�&nbsp; Raising her eyes without lifting her head, she finished, �Can you get Clare, Elizabeth, Danielle and Sophie in here just before knock off?

Sitting back in her chair she continued, �I want to go over this with them and I want to write up an inter-office memo to be sent out to all employees informing them of the change of management and the new perks they&#8217;ll be entitled to if their performance is up to scratch..�

Sabrina giggled, �This is going to be so cool.&nbsp; I&#8217;ll get on it right away.&nbsp; God I&#8217;m going to love my job from here on in.&nbsp; I always said that workplace incentive schemes were a good idea for morale and increasing production output.�

Tiffany was giggling to herself as Sabrina left her office, �Moral?&nbsp; Hmmm, that gives me an idea.&nbsp; What swank title can we make up for our new office toy?�

At four thirty all the females in the firm trekked into Tiffany&#8217;s office, each one smirking at Vivian as they passed her.&nbsp; Vivian knew the office grapevine was healthy and that her demise was spreading through the building like wildfire.&nbsp; She watched dejectedly and wondered if what she had done was a good idea now?&nbsp; Her face flushed hot as they filed passed knowing full well that she was going to be the main topic of conversation, and her pussy wept at the prospect.

She forced herself not to put her hand down to her exposed sex.&nbsp; She never felt so humiliated and degenerate as she did at this moment.&nbsp; She stifled a sob with her left hand as she finally did what she promised herself she wouldn&#8217;t, �Ohhh god, what&#8217;s wrong with me?�&nbsp; She sobbed as her right index finger diddled her clit and a rush of orgasm overtook her senses.

Vivian heard laughing coming from behind the closed door and went back to working her now sopping wet pussy as she imagined what they were saying about her.&nbsp; She was still frantically trying to finish her days unrealistic workload, as the women filed out, laughing as they passed.&nbsp; No one but Clare commented to her directly, but they gave her predatory glances.

Clare blew her a kiss and quipped, �I&#8217;ll be seeing you tomorrow sweet thing!&nbsp; Now you get your sexy arse into Tiffany Office, she has some things she wants to go over with you.�&nbsp; The other women giggled uproariously at her comment.

Vivian&#8217;s eyes showed the horror she felt, but her brain couldn&#8217;t formulate a reply, so she just whimpered.

Tiffany watched as Vivian entered, �On your knees and pull that dress up around your waist, and while you&#8217;re at it you can pull it down off your tits as well.&nbsp; I like to negotiate with the upper hand, if you know what I mean, and listen up.�

Vivian hesitated only briefly before complying, �Ok, now hear me and take heed, because your whole existence depends on how well you take orders.&nbsp; I&#8217;ve just had a meeting as you well know, with my most trusted employees.&nbsp; We&#8217;ve decided to initiate some changes around here and you&#8217;re at the centre of them.

Tiffany watched her reaction as she continued, �First up is a new department, and you&#8217;ll be glad to hear that you are the head of that department.&nbsp; Don&#8217;t thank me, you deserve the promotion, well it&#8217;s not actually a promotion, more like a demotion but you deserve it anyway, but that&#8217;s irrelevant.&nbsp; The new department is Morale and Entertainment, and you are the manager, of course you are the only officer/staff member in that department, so that is also irrelevant!�

Tiffany giggled as she saw Vivian&#8217;s face drop, �So now let&#8217;s get down to business and let me inform you of the MEO&#8217;s job specifications.&nbsp; It&#8217;s pretty simple really, I&#8217;ve written it up so even a moronic cretin like you can understand.�&nbsp; Tiffany handed Vivian a sheet of paper.

~...~

Tiffany was beside herself as Vivian read her contract.&nbsp; It gave her sense of equilibrium a shot in the arm seeing this once arrogant, self-righteous, upper crust harlot get her dues, and&nbsp; was now nothing more than a glorified company whore.&nbsp; Watching the facial expression on Vivian&#8217;s face made cause for immense amusement on her part.&nbsp; 

�You can&#8217;t be serious if you think I&#8217;ll sign this?&nbsp; I&#8217;ll quit before I sign this!�

Tiffany shrugged, �Sign...don&#8217;t sign!&nbsp; It&#8217;s all the same to me.&nbsp; You do have a choice though, sign that document or start stretching your arse and cunt out in preparation for some bull prison dyke to use them as a handbag!�

Tiffany got a kick out of Vivian&#8217;s shudder, �You do know what a prison handbag is?�

Vivian shook her head, �When a big mother fucker bull dyke needs to carry her valuables around, and it can be anything from money and drugs to smokes and lighters, to jewellery or all of the above, you&#8217;re it!.&nbsp; I&#8217;ve even heard that some have their handbags keep their illicit cell phones hidden in their stretched out cunts and arseholes!&nbsp; But that might be just a malicious rumour, so I wouldn&#8217;t go getting too excited about that!�

Vivian&#8217;s mortified expression said it all, �But this basically makes me the office punch board, and company whore!&nbsp;&nbsp; I beg you to reconsider, I have money!&nbsp; I&#8217;ll pay anything to keep this from getting out!�

Tiffany twirled her pen around in her right hand, �If I were you, I&#8217;d just be happy I didn&#8217;t put in there that you&#8217;ll be working nights on the corner of Wicks and Main selling your skanky arse for five dollars a pop, but don&#8217;t fuck with me or you just might be.&nbsp; And to add insult to injury; I intend to take control of your stock options and bank accounts well.&nbsp; You have twenty percent of the company if I&#8217;m not mistaken?&nbsp; That gorgeous mansion you live in; gone!&nbsp; You&#8217;ll sign over the deed tomorrow, so is your car!&nbsp; I have always wanted to drive a Porsche nine eleven...Carrera isn&#8217;t it?�

Tiffany watched as the impalpable struggle rage inside Vivian and as the tears rolled down her cheeks, �Where will I live, how will I get to work?�&nbsp; Vivian whimpered pathetically.

Tiffany sighed twirling her pen between her fingers, �Ok I&#8217;ll lighten up on your skanky arse!&nbsp; You can move into my old apartment, it&#8217;s walking distance from here, although in your new CFM&#8217;s it might be a trial and a half but you&#8217;ll get used to it I&#8217;m sure.&nbsp; The place isn&#8217;t much, but it is clean and a roof over your undeserving arse, so just thank me for my offer.�&nbsp; It was a surprise as she noticed Vivian&#8217;s eyes roll back in her head, and a tremendous shudder took hold of the pathetic wretch as an orgasm tore through her body.

Tiffany dropped her pen in stunned amazement, �You fucking pathetic slut!&nbsp; You just came; again!&nbsp; I don&#8217;t believe it, and this time without even touching yourself!�

Vivian burst out crying in shame and humiliation and clamped her hands over her face, and sobbed violently.

Tiffany picked up her pen and held it out as she giggled her head off, �So I take it you&#8217;ll be signing then?�

Vivian took the pen without looking at Tiffany and through tear filled eyes, she put her mark on the contract that signalled her capitulation and sealed her fate.

�One more thing and you can get on with fore filling your now duties, just so we don&#8217;t over tax your two grey cell pea brain. Your vocabulary will be limited to two word single syllable sentences, they being: Thank you, Yes Ma&#8217;am, Fuck me, Ohhh god and I&#8217;m cumming.&nbsp; Does that prehuman Neanderthal brain comprehend what I&#8217;m saying here?&nbsp; What have you got to say?�

Vivian was almost crying tears of blood as she answered Tiffany, �Yes Ma&#8217;am! Thank you!�

Vivian burst out laughing, Ohhh my god!&nbsp; You&#8217;ve managed to string two sentences together!&nbsp; Who said you can&#8217;t teacher an old bitch new tricks?&nbsp; I hope it didn&#8217;t stress both those grey cells bouncing around inside that cavernous skull of yours?&nbsp; Now get out of here and don&#8217;t let me here any complaints from the rest of my workers.�

From that day on Vivian&#8217;s life was a torment in hell of her own making.&nbsp; Clare was the first staff member to be serviced, and being as homophobic as she was; Vivian threw up quite a lot in the beginning as she was forced to lick and suck on Clare&#8217;s pussy while she had Clare&#8217;s fingers invading hers.&nbsp; It was much to Clare&#8217;s amusement, that is took ages before she could control herself and perform with any amount of satisfaction.

The men in the company were allowed for incentive purposes to use her services and to date there is only one or two who haven&#8217;t taken liberties.&nbsp; If it wasn&#8217;t some supply room, then it was an unoccupied office they took her in, pounding away at her sex like some deranged jackhammer on steroids and then having her suck and lick their slick cocks clean after they had finished sexually abusing her.

If that wasn&#8217;t humiliating and degrading enough, it was all the women with the exception of Sophie, taking turns using her mouth for stress relief that was the hardest to take.&nbsp; Her mouth couldn&#8217;t have tasted worse than if she was used as a urinal in some flophouse!

Even being triple plugged air tight by the pimply faced geeks in the mailroom on the sorting table wasn&#8217;t as bad.&nbsp; Vivian thought that she might just get away with intimidating the younger geeks, but Tiffany had seen to that and they ponced on her like ravenous dogs after a bitch on heat.&nbsp; Mauling and probing her most private parts, before taking turns turning her cunt, arse and face into a swamp of white goo.

Sophie didn&#8217;t leave her totally alone, unlike the other women who loved getting tongue jobs during the day; Sophie&#8217;s thing was having her toes sucked while at her desk.

Vivian couldn&#8217;t believe that walking around in CFM&#8217;s, short miniskirt and see though tops was worse than being totally naked.&nbsp; The latest indignity was signing over title deed to her plush upmarket home in a gated community to Tiffany and having to live in her cockroach infested rat hole of an apartment.

Scraping together enough money just to pay the rent was difficult on her lower pay rate, but the consequences didn&#8217;t bare thinking about.&nbsp; The fat disgusting landlord had made it obvious from the start that he would be willing to take certain liberties in lieu of allowing Vivian to be late in paying her rent.&nbsp; If she decided that she couldn&#8217;t pay at all that week, then he&#8217;d work out an arrangement whereby she could entertain certain people he knew.&nbsp; Vivian knew full well what that meant, and Tiffany&#8217;s threat of pimping her out on street corners came to mind.

Tiffany shuddered as Vivian talented tongue brought her to another glorious climax.&nbsp; She pushed Vivian away and closed her legs, �Get up Vivian and take a seat!�

Vivian crawled backward out from under the desk and sat meekly, still with her breasts exposed and skirt up around her waist.

Tiffany sat back a stared at this bedraggled creature in front of her and thought, �What&#8217;s her game? Why has she allowed us to treat her so abominably?&nbsp; She knew if any of their actions got out then she herself, and most of the staff here at Dynamics were toast!&nbsp; She knew she had one ace up her sleeve, but if Vivian decided to fight it, then that wouldn&#8217;t be of much use when push came to shove.

Why are you here?�

Vivian looked up, �Huh, what do you mean?&nbsp; I&#8217;m here because it&#8217;s what you&#8217;re making me do to get revenge on me for being so arrogantly stupid!�

Tiffany studied the wet sheen of pussy juice on Vivian&#8217;s face, �Bullshit Vivian!�

Vivian stared blank faced at Tiffany and so she pursued her inquiry, �I want to know why you&#8217;ve allowed us to take advantage of you, and continue to take liberties with you?�

Vivian&#8217;s face displayed slight confusion, �I&#8217;m still not sure what you&#8217;re trying to say Ms Carmichael.&nbsp; I have no choice in the matter as you have so vehemently stated?�

Tiffany smiled at Vivian&#8217;s reluctance in coming clean, �I believe you have always known, as I know now that that isn&#8217;t so!�&nbsp; She pushed the folder containing the fraudulent documents across to Vivian, �You know as well as I do Ms Donohue that for blackmail purposes these documents aren&#8217;t worth the paper they&#8217;re printed on!�

Vivian stared at the folder then back to Tiffany, �What makes you think that?�

Tiffany was getting annoyed by Vivian&#8217;s refusal to acknowledge that facts, �I&#8217;ll let you in on a little secret.&nbsp; I got the heads up a couple of days ago about a government audit of our firm.&nbsp; I&#8217;m sure you know all about them, being under contract to the Department of Defence to supply certain armaments.&nbsp; For security reasons they happen every now and again!

Vivian suddenly thought she knew where Tiffany was going with her inquiry, but kept quiet until she spelled it out, �I was a little concerned that if they stumbled on your little back pocket lining exercise, then we could all be out one MEO, not to mention in a little strife of our own, once you were brought in for interrogation and rolled over on us for a more lenient prison sentence. Not that we couldn&#8217;t get past that, but I&#8217;d rather not have to deal with it in the first place.�

�So you think I set it all up to trap you in a conspiracy?�

�The thought had crossed my mind, when I was trying to clean up your pathetic attempt at covering your trail.�

Tiffany leant back in her chair, �Imagine my total surprise and confusion when the paper trail of your illicit dealings led nowhere outside of this office.�

Tiffany waited for Vivian to refute her statements and she didn&#8217;t, �So yes, I thought you had ulterior motives for going along with the charade, but it just seemed too drastic a measure to get rid of an entire work force, and for what purpose?&nbsp; There was no evidence of impropriety on the part of any staff members.&nbsp; You&#8217;d be left hiring new and inexperienced people.&nbsp; You knew I&#8217;d find those bogus reports, and I&#8217;m almost sure you also knew what I&#8217;d do with them when I found them.&nbsp; So now I&#8217;m left wondering what your motive is Ms Donohue?�

Vivian hung her head disheartened.&nbsp; It felt like the earth fell from beneath her and she was falling into an abyss of lethargy �And it was all going so well!� she mumbled as a single tear roll silently down her cheek.

�Pardon me?�&nbsp; Tiffany was now really confused, �I was thinking of calling Mr Bartholomew and asking him what was going on, but I thought I&#8217;d let you come clean first.�

Vivian wiped at her face, sniffed back her sorrow and stood, re-buttoning her blouse.&nbsp; Pulling her skirt down to cover her modesty again, she cleared her throat, �The jig is up as they say, and you&#8217;ve got me.&nbsp; I&#8217;m really sorry you found out, although you may not think so, I was having the time of my life.�

Tiffany was now so totally confused, she just sat with her mouth open, �You have got to be kidding me?�

Vivian cheered slightly at Tiffany&#8217;s confusion and smiled, �I&#8217;m not kidding you Tiffany, and ringing Trent wouldn&#8217;t have done you any good, unless you have a direct line to heaven or hell!&nbsp; Personally I&#8217;m banking on hell.�

Vivian giggled at Tiffany&#8217;s expression, �Have you got Trent&#8217;s number in your cell phone?�

Tiffany nodded, �Then call him now and see what he says.�

Tiffany opened her phone and hit speed dial.&nbsp; A red button started flashing on her office phone and Vivian pick up the hand piece as she pressed the button and spoke, �Yes Ms Carmichael, I see you&#8217;ve found out our little secret my dear!�

Tiffany&#8217;s jaw dropped as she heard a man&#8217;s voice on her cell saying, �Yes Ms Carmichael, I see you&#8217;ve found out our little secret my dear!�

Tiffany was flabbergasted, �It was you all along!&nbsp; You set all this up, but why?�&nbsp; She now realised that Vivian had her by the throat, and the tables had turned one eighty degrees.&nbsp; She never felt so sickly frightened as she did at this moment.

Vivian smiled sadly as she replaced the phone handset, �Yes Tiffany, you&#8217;ve heard the quote,
 
�All the world's a stage, and all the men and women merely players:...�

� they have their exits and their entrances; and one man in his time plays many parts, his acts being seven ages.�  Tiffany finished for her.&nbsp; �Yes I&#8217;ve done Shakespeare a school, what of it?&nbsp; What are you trying to get at?�


�This was always my play Tiffany!&nbsp; And it was going so well until your damnable ethics for fair play put a monkey wrench in the works trying to save my stupid arse.&nbsp; I should have anticipated this, and made it harder for you, but I got sloppy from the sheer thrill of my fantasy coming to fruition.�

Tiffany still couldn&#8217;t get her head around what Vivian was saying and it certainly showed in her face, �I know your confused by all this my dear, but this isn&#8217;t the time or place to be discussing the details.�

Vivian was trying not to upset Tiffany because she didn&#8217;t really deserve it, �How about you allow me to knock off an hour early so I can go home to your place and prepare us a nice Fettuccine Carbonara and tossed green salad, you can pick a couple of bottles of white wine; a Chardonnay would be nice.&nbsp; We can go over all this tonight, what do you say?�

Tiffany was stunned, �You&#8217;re asking me if you can take time off?&nbsp; With what you have just eluded to I would think that you can come and go as you damn well please?�

Vivian smiled compassionately, �I know I can, but for reasons that I&#8217;ll endeavour to explain tonight, please just allow me the luxury of finishing out this last day.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s all that much to ask for?�

~...~

The two women ate in silence eyeing each other across the dining room table until Tiffany couldn&#8217;t hold her tongue any longer, �Ok Ms Donohue, you&#8217;ve got me and the meal is wonderful, but I&#8217;m dying here!�

Vivian giggled, �I&#8217;m sure you are my dear, so I&#8217;ll put you out of your misery.&nbsp; To start with; neither you nor any of the employees at Dynamics Inc have anything to worry about from me!&nbsp; I set it all up and I take full responsibility for any act committed upon my person over the last three months.�

Tiffany just shook her head in amazement, �I still don&#8217;t understand?�

Vivian mouthed the last small potion Fettuccini from her fork and chewed slowly as she contemplated how to explain her gambit.&nbsp; Swallowing, she then wiped her mouth with her napkin, placing it on her now empty plate, �To understand you need to know my relationship with Trent Bartholomew!&nbsp; Trent was my father, and the reason my Surname is Donohue is because I married Carl Donohue in a bid to get out from under my father&#8217;s controlling influence.&nbsp; My father&#8217;s dead by the way.&nbsp; May his soul rot in hell!�

Tiffany had so many questions but held her tongue, �I can see you want to know why I hate my dear departed dad?�&nbsp; Tiffany nodded, �My father was a workaholic tyrant, he actually wanted a son to hand off his empire, and believe me when I tell you that what you see at Dynamics is only the tip of a very large iceberg.�

Tiffany&#8217;s jaw dropped, �You mean to say that I have a controlling interest in an empire?�

Vivian burst out laughing, �No my dear, I&#8217;m sorry to say that you only own twenty percent of Dynamics.&nbsp; Not that that isn&#8217;t a fair chunk of change, but when you take in the whole, it isn&#8217;t anymore than pocket coinage to me! Take this house that I allowed you to so eagerly get your hands on.&nbsp; I have several around the world twice as grand and expensive as this one.�

Tiffany was starting see that she wasn&#8217;t just playing with a firecracker when she stated this, but a damn atomic bomb, the humiliation that she heaped on this woman she now felt herself, and her stupidity was coming back and biting her on the arse, �You must think I&#8217;m a stupid moron for thinking I held all the cards?�

Vivian smiled, �As you so elegantly stated back when you first confronted me...Au contraire mademoiselle.&nbsp; I think you are a very smart and astute business woman, and I&#8217;m so proud of your accomplishments.&nbsp; You have outshone my wildest dreams!� 

Tiffany was so confused she couldn&#8217;t speak, �Huh?�

Vivian sighed, �Ok, to save a lot of time, let me explain how you got here in a point fashion.�&nbsp; Tiffany mind was racing to catch up and so she just shrugged her acceptance.


�As I&#8217;ve just said, my father was a workaholic.&nbsp; He got that way because of a car accident he blamed on my mother, which put him in a wheelchair and destroyed any chance of fathering a son to take over his business; he had no other avenue for his frustrations.&nbsp; My mother, god bless her soul may she rest in peace, drank herself to death out of sheer guilt over the accident.�




�My father ignored me most likely because I was female and to a point where all I wanted, was to get away from him as far as possible, hence my marriage to Carl.&nbsp; It didn&#8217;t last, and I suspect that my father had a hand in it, because Carl disappeared without so much as a note saying, �I&#8217;ve had a nice time, thanks for all the blowjobs!� I don&#8217;t know why and I have never seen him since to be able to find out.�




�When my father got sick, he was in the process of setting up Bartrell Enterprises.&nbsp; Named after him and my mother.&nbsp; Bart being the first four letters of his name, Bartholomew and rell being the last four letter of my mother&#8217;s maiden name, Martrell.�




�My father was also a control freak!&nbsp; Every job I got was thwarted by his interference until I had no choice but to return and enter the family business, something I truly detested.&nbsp; You would think if he had so little interest in me as a child, then he&#8217;d certainly not care what I did or where I went.&nbsp; But that&#8217;s the nature of a possessive, anally retentive, workaholic, insomniac. �




�When he died I thought I was free to pursue my passion, which by the way is also my fetish.&nbsp; My husband saw submissiveness in my demeanour and encouraged it; we also found out rather quickly that I get incredibly turned on when humiliated, debased and embarrassed the more the better.&nbsp; I foolishly thought I&#8217;d be free to indulge myself after my father&#8217;s death, but good old dad was still pulling the strings even from his grave.�




�He set up his will so that for me to inherit Bartrell any part thereof, or even so much as make any sort of a living, I had to work for the company.&nbsp; The mistake he made, and the one I found out about was that I didn&#8217;t need to be running the company as he had wished, just employed by the company.&nbsp; I&#8217;m almost certain my father knew of my fetish and he figured that if I was a high profile business woman, then I&#8217;d have to keep my nose clean.




While I don&#8217;t actually run Bartrell, I do have access to its vast recourses.&nbsp; I have one third of the stock, with the other two thirds divvied up between the other members of The Board of Directors.&nbsp; My father set out strict guidelines as to how and in what fashion the members of the board were elected. 




�By the end of my father&#8217;s illustrious life he&#8217;d done a Howard Hughes, and become a recluse.&nbsp; The Board of Director at Bartrell are men selected by my father for their like-mindedness.&nbsp; They were of the opinion that keeping my father&#8217;s demise as low key as possible would minimise financial disruption to Bartrell.&nbsp; Like my father they are not to be toyed with.&nbsp; I get away with what I do only under sufferance and the fact that I am the only heir to the Bartrell Empire.� 




Before you ask why I didn&#8217;t just sign on as a secretary, or girlfriday, and continue my fetish in secret.&nbsp; It was more to get back at my father, while enjoying my fetish.&nbsp; Can you imagine him turning over in his graves as the employees of his empire degrade and humiliate his only child, the product of his seed?&nbsp; I know he&#8217;s dead, but I cling to the sadistic thought that there is a life after and he is in hell with the devil taunting him about the degenerate slut offspring from his very own loins!�




�I stewed for twelve months, trying to find some way out of my father&#8217;s control, and I hit on this little gem, so I scouted around for someone I could help foster into taking over, and you are the end result of that search.�




�You performed your part in my play better than I had ever expected.&nbsp; You are my very own Judas of Iscariot, and I&#8217;m indebted to you for giving me three wonderfully glorious months of sexual bliss. I&#8217;m just sorry that after all the effort I put into my play, it was kyboshed after only three months.�



Vivian sat back in her chair and sipped her wine waiting for Tiffany to process all that information.&nbsp; Tiffany for her part was lost in thought, mulling over everything she&#8217;d been told.

Tiffany finished her wine and poured another, �I don&#8217;t know how I feel about being a Judas, but you&#8217;re saying that everything I did was with your approval?

Vivian nodded but said nothing, letting Tiffany expound on her theories, �You&#8217;re no Messiah Vivian!&nbsp; How could you possibly guarantee that I would be capable of doing what you wanted?&nbsp; You were taking an enormous risk that I might have taken your entire empire for myself and leave you destitute?�

Vivian burst out laughing, �That my dear is the last thing I have to worry about.&nbsp; First off is that you only have twenty percent of Dynamics, while I control seventy percent of this particular company with voting rights to my father&#8217;s stock, the other ten percent is spread around out in public hands, there is no way you&#8217;d get anywhere near taking anything off me that I didn&#8217;t allow.�

Vivian took a sip from her wine glass, �For argument sake let&#8217;s say you did manage to wrestle Dynamics away from me.&nbsp; That company is only a minute portion of what makes up Bartrell Enterprises!&nbsp; I would just go and take control of one of the other companies in the portfolio and then come after you with so much hellfire and brimstone that you&#8217;d be blowing winos in the park for pocket change just to get your next meal.

Tiffany blanch at Vivian&#8217;s implied threat, �I&#8217;m sorry, I...I didn&#8217;t mean to imply that I would do it.&nbsp; Just that you were...�&nbsp; She decided not to finished, realising that all she would do is dig herself a deeper hole.

Vivian chortled, �Relax sweetie, I know you wouldn&#8217;t do anything of a sort.�

Tiffany raised her eye, questioning Vivian&#8217;s assurance, �No one can be that sure of what others will do Ms Donohue.�

Vivian let out an exasperated sigh, �Ohhh for heaven sake will you please refrain from the formalities Tiffany?&nbsp; I see us as two friends having dinner and chatting.&nbsp; Call me Vivian, Viv, slut, fuckface, cuntrag, cumbucket...I don&#8217;t know... any other derogatory name you can think of, but for the love of Mike quit with the Ms Donohue crap!&nbsp; After glorious hell you have put me through for the last three months I would appreciate the sentiment.�

Tiffany was taken back a bit by Vivian&#8217;s statement, �Ummm well ok...Vivian ...Cuntrag, if you insist.�&nbsp; Tiffany saw the grin of Vivian&#8217;s face and stated to giggle herself �Look!&nbsp; I&#8217;m just trying to catch up here, ok?&nbsp;&nbsp; All this has come as quite a shock!&nbsp; Here I thought I had you all worked out and sown up in a nice little package, and you&#8217;ve done a Houdini on me in no time flat!&nbsp; I am interested in knowing just how you came to the conclusion that I&#8217;d be perfect for your charade?�

Vivian rose from her chair, picking up her wine glass and the bottle, �Since dinner is over, how about we adjourn to the lounge and finish our discussion there?�

Tiffany followed on the understanding that her previous worries were superable, �There are so many questions, I just don&#8217;t know where to start?�

Vivian settled into a comfortable rocker/ recliner, �All in good time Tiffany, we have all night to find your answers!&nbsp; Let me tell you how I settled on you first.�

Tiffany sighed, �Yes I suppose that is the big question filling my mind.�

Vivian refilled their glasses as she spoke, �As you know I&#8217;m thirty five, and my father died almost eight years ago.&nbsp; Taking into account the year I took to find my escape route, I then started looking just over seven years prior to now.&nbsp; Can you remember what you were doing about that time?�

Tiffany shrugged, �That&#8217;s a no brainer, I was ending my education from high school.&nbsp; I was having to settling for that fact that I was going to be looking for some low paying dead end job, until one of my substitute teachers helped me get a scholarship to university.&nbsp; That was the turning point in my career!�

Vivian smiled knowingly, �You&#8217;re right!&nbsp; Mrs Bedford, if I&#8217;m not mistaken.�

Tiffany blinked, �You know her?�

Vivian chortled, �Of course I know her, she&#8217;s one of Bartrell&#8217;s employees I had come to your assistance.&nbsp; Your full scholarship was supplied by me via Dexter Pharmaceuticals, also a subsidiary of Bartrell!�

Tiffany struggled to keep up, �You&#8217;re say that you paid for my higher education?�

Vivian shrugged, �Let&#8217;s say I invested in my charade!&nbsp; I saw you about two months before then and had Singleton Investigations, again Bartrell, to check you out.&nbsp; I found out you were a strong intelligent, independent, motivated young lady who fiercely stood by her friends and family, and for no fault of her own was destined to a life struggling to make ends meet!�&nbsp; 

Vivian could see the wheels turning in Tiffany&#8217;s mind, �In fact there is very little I don&#8217;t know about you.&nbsp; I know you had a guest list of twenty three close friends, and only fifteen showed up for your eighteenth birthday party, you were most upset.&nbsp; You graduated with distinctions from both high school and university.&nbsp; The first car you owned was a Ford Festiva, a hideous purple if I remember rightly, which I might add you proceeded to right off in an accident with an army truck!&nbsp; You were very lucky my dear to get out of that with only minor cut and bruises!� 

Tiffany was now seeing the magnitude of Vivian&#8217;s plan, the sheer logistics of planning and organising of such detail must have been horrendous �You&#8217;re telling me you started on this charade seven years ago?&nbsp; Why not just find someone already in a position of authority, make them a deal and save all that time money and effort?�

�As you stated in the beginning, I couldn&#8217;t guarantee that they wouldn&#8217;t stab me in the back.&nbsp; I needed someone I could mould into the sort of person I needed.&nbsp; I know that sounds like manipulation, and it is, but not all manipulation is bad.&nbsp; Life is manipulation!&nbsp; Human beings make an art form out of it, we manipulate our environment, and those around us.&nbsp; Manipulation happens every day, by me, you, Sabrina; everyone has done and is doing it all the time.&nbsp; Only when one person loses so that another can win does it becomes unacceptable.�

�To answer your previous question.&nbsp; You seem to think that I put my life on hold while I was grooming you for your role in my play.&nbsp; Not so my dear!&nbsp; Look at it this way; do you put the kettle on in the morning and then stand there for the next five to ten minutes while it comes to the boil, or do you go about your morning ritual of making toast, getting dressed, reading the paper?&nbsp; It&#8217;s the same with this; I didn&#8217;t put my life on hold after I put events in motion.&nbsp; I went about my normal daily routine and every now and then checked on the progress until the time was right to enjoy myself.�

Tiffany couldn&#8217;t grasp the dedication it took to see this through, �Weren&#8217;t you worried that at anytime things could go astray?&nbsp; All that time and effort wasted on a singularity.�

Vivian nodded with a certain amount of satisfaction, �As you get to know me Tiffany, you will understand that my father; as much as I disliked him; He and I have a few traits in common, and both go together to make his empire what it is, and my plan as complex as it was.&nbsp; We are both fanatics for perfection, detail, and above all else patience.&nbsp; Your query as to why I didn&#8217;t take someone more experienced.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t put my trust in too many people; there are too many variables to contend with, with someone already in the workforce having agendas of their own.�

�To answer another one of your question, you&#8217;re right when you said that I&#8217;m not the Messiah, heaven forbid that someone as fucked up as me should have divinity.�&nbsp; Tiffany raised her eyebrow at the connotation that that statement raised.&nbsp; Vivian saw the eyebrow and stopped in thought.&nbsp; Both women looked at one another and the burst out laughing, as Vivian clarified, �I&#8217;m sure if there is a god, it would be more than heaven doing the forbidding!�

Tiffany giggled with a new appreciation of the woman sitting in front of her, �I don&#8217;t know of anyone who could hold such dedication for so long.&nbsp; I suppose you&#8217;re going to tell me that my job at Oztronics was your doing?�

Vivian waved her head from side to side with a silly grin, �Ok...Subsidiary of Bartrell again!�

�What about Langland Engineering?�

�Bartrell!�

�Jesus H fucking Christ!&nbsp; IS there anything I&#8217;ve done that you haven&#8217;t had a hand in?�

Vivian thought for a minute then snapped her fingers, �I wasn&#8217;t responsible for you getting caught being spit roasted between Jack Williams and Tom Ganger by your uncle Alfred!&nbsp; That was entirely your doing, but I was impressed.&nbsp; You were barely eighteen at the time, and your uncle is a very free spirited sort of chat, although it did take two grand to buy his silence.�

Tiffany slapped her hands to a face that had instantaneously combusted, �Ohhh my fucking god!&nbsp; I thought I&#8217;d never live that down.�&nbsp; Vivian got up to get the other bottle of wine and refill their glasses, �Here have a drink, it&#8217;ll help with drowning the humiliation, I know I&#8217;ve been there many times.�

Tiffany looked up to Vivian, �You&#8217;re a cunt, you know that!&nbsp; And you&#8217;re lying sack of shit too!�

Vivian stopped dead in her tracks and blinked, �Pardon?�

�Tiffany didn&#8217;t know whether to laugh or cry, so she did both, �You did fucking well have a hand in it!&nbsp; I spent six god damn awful months worrying when my uncle would drop the axe on me to my parents.&nbsp; If I had known that he was in your pocket...Do you know I would do anything if his name was put to the request?&nbsp;&nbsp; I&#8217;d be like shot out of a cannon!�

Vivian laughed, �Ohhh my girl!&nbsp; I didn&#8217;t lie, you asked me if I had a hand in anything, and I told you truth, I didn&#8217;t help you into the mess you made, I did help you out of it.&nbsp; Semantics I know, think of me as your guardian angel, well actually Celeste was really the one looking after you, I was just financing it!&nbsp; One of the reasons I put you on the list was that threesome you got yourself caught in.&nbsp; I knew then that you would appreciate the effectiveness humiliation can have in controlling people.�

Tiffany got up and walked around shaking her head, �No, no, no, don&#8217;t tell me that&nbsp; Cele... ohhh Christ!&nbsp; How does Celeste fit into your empire?&nbsp; Did you have anything to do with getting my father his job at Langland, when he was retrenched by Global?�

�What do you think Tiff?&nbsp; Celeste was the one who helped him with getting his job at Langland, yes!&nbsp; He was pissed as a nute, dribbling into his beer about losing his job with Global.&nbsp; Celeste rang me from the pub and I set it up so she could offer him the job at Langland.&nbsp; It also gave me someone on the inside to help you out of any trouble you got yourself into. IE: Your spit roasting. �

Tiffany slumped back into her armchair and sighed, �Say no more, so you have your finger in every aspect of my life?�

Vivian shrugged, �No not everything!�&nbsp; She smiled sympathetically, �Everyone makes mistakes my dear, I know that from bitter personal experience.&nbsp; I just gave you the chance to shine as I knew in my heart you would.&nbsp; You weren&#8217;t the only one I was grooming, but for what it&#8217;s worth, you ended up the pick of a very select few.�

Tiffany upended her glass of wine and swallowed it in one go and held it out again for a refill, �Ok, this has been a shock to my system.&nbsp; Nothing will ever look the same again!� Tiffany needed to regain her composure and took a long slow breath deep in thought.&nbsp; One particular quote coming to mind...

 �Human life itself may be almost pure chaos, but the work of the artist&#8212;the only thing he's good for&#8212;is to take these handfuls of confusion and disparate things, things that seem to be irreconcilable, and put them together in a frame to give them some kind of shape and meaning. Even if it's only his view of a meaning. That's what he's for&#8212;to give his view of life.�&nbsp;&nbsp; Katherine Anne Porter. 

Tiffany smiled, �Vivian was certainly an artist, and this is her view of the perfect life!�&nbsp;&nbsp; She levelled her eyes on the woman sitting with her, as though just this act would bore holes right through her, �There is one glaring inconsistency in this whole drama as I see it?�

Vivian&#8217;s mouth turned up in a cockeyed smile, then she chortled, �Damn I knew you were good, and you prove me right every single time!&nbsp; You&#8217;re wondering why the pathetically sloppy way in which I misled you into believing I was corrupt?�

Tiffany raised her glass feeling the wine going to her head, �Indubitably my dear Watson!&nbsp; With all that preparation and planning that went into this pastiche, and yet you let it all unravel with a stupid, if not moronic display of ineptitude!�

�Pastiche?&nbsp; I might have to look that word up in my dictionary.�

Tiffany giggled, �Don&#8217;t bother; I have words sent to me via a website that gives me the word of the day and its meaning.&nbsp; That one happened to be yesterday&#8217;s word; it means a �work of art, formed from disparate sources, an incongruous combination of materials, forms, motifs, etc., taken from different sources.
� which is exactly what this whole gambit is.&nbsp; And to have such stupidity is akin to a Professor of Chemistry adding glycerine to permanganate of potash and then sticking it his damn pocket for later, don&#8217;t you think?�


Vivian blinked, �I&#8217;m sorry, but I was never good at chemistry!�


Tiffany shook her head, �It&#8217;ll ignite and burn a damn hole in it!&nbsp; And that is exactly what you did, with that asinine idea of fraud you pulled!� 

Vivian burst out laughing, �Touch� my dear!&nbsp; And it embarrasses me to distraction, but not in the way I would wish for.&nbsp; All I can say in defence is that I spent seven years planning this... Pastiche!&nbsp; Damn!&nbsp; I do love that word.&nbsp; Anyway, even though I have my father&#8217;s patience and dedication, there does come a time when sexual frustration overcomes practical sensibility.�

�You have no idea what I was going through the week prior to you confronting me in my office.&nbsp; The sexual tension in me was excruciating, and it took all my strength not to cum even as I unbuttoned my suit jacket.&nbsp; You saw what happened when Sabrina just touched my pussy lips in the office.&nbsp; And I assure you that I&#8217;m one hundred percent heterosexual.�

�I was so wired up, I could hardly think for the last month and that caused me to get sloppy.&nbsp; You have no idea how close I came to throwing it all out right there and then, but then when you seemed to accept the planted evidence, I thought I&#8217;d lucked out and didn&#8217;t bother trying to cover my tracks.&nbsp; I was too caught up and content to wallow in my own nefarious pig pen!�

Tiffany had to appreciate Vivian&#8217;s explanation, �I think I can see your point, and in a weird way I&#8217;m impressed.&nbsp; So what now?&nbsp; Do I lose my job and have to look for employment elsewhere?�

Vivian sagged into her chair, �Heaven&#8217;s no my dear, I could never take your position away from you now.&nbsp; No Tiffany, you earned that job with a lot of blood sweat and tears.&nbsp; You&#8217;re more than capable of running the business!&nbsp; Profit margins are now up four fold since you took over!�

�I&#8217;m absolutely happy for your continuation as President, and all the perks that go with it, including this house and car.&nbsp; I can&#8217;t impress on you enough how much I adore you and all the staff at Dynamics.&nbsp; I just don&#8217;t know what I&#8217;ll do?&nbsp; I never planned for this contingency.&nbsp; I supposed I could go over to one of the other Bartrell subsidiaries.&nbsp; Although I do like the atmosphere at Dynamics and the personnel.�

Tiffany sat sipping her wine for awhile deep in thought before a smile came to her lips, �I see that you have two options to consider.&nbsp; One is you leave Dynamics and as you stated earlier and take up employment in one of the other subsidiaries.&nbsp; Or two you can continue on just as before as if nothing has changed.�

Vivian smiled sadly, �Thanks for the thought, but I think it&#8217;ll have to be leaving Dynamics.�

Tiffany sat forward, �Why?&nbsp; You said you enjoyed your last three months there.&nbsp; And I know all the staff were really getting to like the added benefits.�

�You don&#8217;t understand the subtleties of the game!&nbsp; It&#8217;s the complete knowledge that it&#8217;s being done without coercion on the part of the worker there.&nbsp; They&#8217;re free to think up whatever humiliations they wish, and I have no say in them.&nbsp; If they know I like it, then it changes to whole flavour of the game.�

Tiffany nodded but disagreed, �Ok I agree the game has changed slightly by me knowing, and if we continue then Sabrina will have to know as well, but the other won&#8217;t and they will be free to treat you the way they have been doing.&nbsp; In front of them, you can still feel the humiliation and degradation you crave.�

Vivian sat and thought for a minute, �Why would Sabrina need to know?�

Tiffany smiled, �Who the fuck do you think thought up ninety five percent of your trials?&nbsp; She has a devastatingly wicked mind that woman, but lately she&#8217;s been holding back.&nbsp; I have admit that so have I, because we&#8217;re starting to think you&#8217;ve been punished enough.&nbsp; Can you imagine if she knew, and she wasn&#8217;t held back by guilt?�

�I can&#8217;t even begin to imagine just how cruelly cunning she could be in devising humiliating situations?&nbsp; You lessen the effect by two of us knowing, but we then have the ability to triple everyone else&#8217;s effect.&nbsp; They will follow our lead, and you will have to put up with it.&nbsp; I&#8217;m sorry I belayed your play, but I still have one ace up my sleeve, and that is outing you to everyone in the community if you don&#8217;t continue.&nbsp; Take that little bit of blackmail and revel in it!�

Vivian giggled, �You forget my dear, I know you inside and out.&nbsp; I doubt very much if after everything we&#8217;ve been discussing that your conscience would allow you to publicly hang me out to dry.&nbsp; But I thank you for the offer!&nbsp;&nbsp; And what makes you think the rest of them would go along with your proposal, do you really think you could keep it running?�

�I&#8217;d bet both your tits on it you stupid cumbucket.&nbsp; You know what those guys are like; they couldn&#8217;t give a fat rat&#8217;s arse, as long as they get their cocks wet in any one of your holes!&nbsp; And I know Clare just loves making you service her, she gets a real kick out of shoving her pussy in your face and making you eat her to orgasm.�

Tiffany sat back on her couch studying her nails, before looking over at Vivian with a cheeky smile, �You say you&#8217;re not gay Viv, but you were born to eat pussy!&nbsp; Tiffany saw the pinkish hue creep up Vivian&#8217;s cheeks and giggled, �You&#8217;re so damn good at it, that I&#8217;d love to tattoo it on your forehead.�

Vivian patted her cheeks and fanned her face, �Shut up!&nbsp; Any more talk like that and I&#8217;ll be cumming in the chair.�

Tiffany giggled, �All of the girls have commented on your talents, they all believe that you&#8217;re a closet gay wannabe; even Clare admits that when it comes to eating snatch, you&#8217;re up there with the best of them.&nbsp; As for the other girls, well they&#8217;ve accepted that they can get their pussy eaten by you, something they aren&#8217;t always getting from their husbands at home.�

 �Which reminds me?&nbsp; I know what drive the guys, but how in hell did you get just about all of us girls to treat you the way we have.&nbsp; Clare I understand , Sophie as well because she just gets you running after her for coffee and stuff or to suck her toes, but I mean, I don&#8217;t have a lesbian bone in my body, but I do enjoy your tongue.&nbsp; How does that work?�

Vivian stiffened, �I was hoping you wouldn&#8217;t ask me that one.&nbsp; You may not like the answer, but since we&#8217;re now working on honesty, trust and understanding I suppose I&#8217;ll have to let you in on the secret.&nbsp; To start with, the men are easy as you so rightly put it, I managed over the time I&#8217;ve been in charge to cull out and transfer any married men who are in a stable monogamous relationships.&nbsp; Again a win/win situation for them, they have got as good or better jobs now.&nbsp; If you go around the male staff you will find that what&#8217;s left are either single or have open marriages.&nbsp; I didn&#8217;t want to break up a happy marriage with infidelity.�

Tiffany nodded, �Impressive, I&#8217;m pleased you have a conscience, what about the females?�

�Are yes, that was a little bit trickery!&nbsp; Ok, you&#8217;ve heard of subliminal messaging?�

�Yes of course, it has been done on the sly in advertising.&nbsp; Displaying picture, sound and even smells just outside the conscious mind&#8217;s range to perceive them but well within the subconscious realm.&nbsp; But they won&#8217;t make you do anything out of character, like turning a normal heterosexual woman into lesbian.�

�I know that, but it will strengthen what&#8217;s already there.&nbsp; Have you ever walked down the street hand in hand with one of your female friends?�

�Of course I have, a lot of women do.�

�My point exactly!&nbsp; Men don&#8217;t do it, unless they gay.&nbsp; Men perceive that sort of contact as questioning on their sexuality, where generally women don&#8217;t feel that their femineity is threatened.&nbsp; The difference between the sexes, it&#8217;s why there&#8217;s so much lesbian action in porno films and unless you get a gay film out specifically aimed at the gay male, then you won&#8217;t see male on male in a normal porno film.�

I once read an article on the porn industry.&nbsp; In it the interview asked the actress how she could do girl on girl scenes if she wasn&#8217;t atleast bi-sexual.&nbsp; She shrugged and said that although there were bi-sexual and lesbian actresses in the porn industry, it didn&#8217;t bother her, she still saw herself as a normal heterosexual female once she left the set!�&nbsp; 

It was then revealed that the same question was put to a male actor and he basically said that if the director didn&#8217;t actually get punched out then he was severely berated for asking the actor to become a faggot, unless of course the guy was bi or gay.&nbsp; The sexual act is basically seen as a dominance of one over the other.&nbsp; Women are exposed to it all the time, where men see themselves as the dominant figure in the sexual act.&nbsp; If there are two men, then one has to take the back seat. For a male&#8217;s ego, that my dear is a killer!�

�Ok, I&#8217;ll go along with the fact that women can be more touchy feely, without feeling threatened, but that&#8217;s a far cry from being paid, or in a lesbian situation.�

�You&#8217;re right, but think about what you were feeling this morning when I was under your desk.&nbsp; You weren&#8217;t thinking that this is a woman doing these things for you?&nbsp; No, you were thinking of the power you were wielding and just thinking how good it felt.&nbsp; Am I right?�

Tiffany took a swig of her wine, �Yes, I think your right there, but I still don&#8217;t understand how you managed to do it?�

Vivian smiled, �All the computers at work have a program I installed on them that is targeted to easing the minds of the girls and allowing their inhibitions to relax enough to allow minimal contact that they are receptive to in the first place and that society has brainwashed them into thinking is unacceptable.�

�Images and sounds flash in microseconds ever few seconds up on the screen.&nbsp; Not enough time for the conscious mind to grab hold of but certainly enough to get it into your head.&nbsp; That&#8217;s why Sophie only wants me to get her coffee and to suck her toes, her own personal perception says that vaginal contact between women is unacceptable.&nbsp; The rest of you are more open to a little more, right up to Clare who is openly homosexual.�

Tiffany was shaking her head, �What about you, and your wants and needs?�

Vivian smirked, �That is the Pi�ce de r�sistance!&nbsp; I have a similar subliminal message, but instead, mine does the opposite to yours.&nbsp; Mine reinforces my revulsion toward doing these lesbian acts.&nbsp; It pushes me to be more submissive and stops me from putting up resistance to your wishes.�

�It reminds me of how pathetic I am for allowing everyone to humiliate and degrade me, while reinforcing my sexual lust for the humiliation.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t use any other computer, so I don&#8217;t get affected by the other messages you girls get.&nbsp; I also have a self hypnoses program I run at home that does a better job of keeping me in a state of humiliation.�

�Why do you need that if the subliminal messages would be working like ours?�

�Because I&#8217;m being subjected to harsher out of character treatment, and sooner or later it will all become blas� and I lose that which makes it exciting.&nbsp; You do something for long enough, it becomes second nature, and ceases to be against the norm.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t want to get to liking what I&#8217;m being forced to do.&nbsp; Can you understand that?�

Tiffany shook her head, �I don&#8217;t know if you&#8217;re crazy or not, but if you are then I may be heading into the same looney bin with you, because I think I understand what you&#8217;re trying to say here.�&nbsp; Tiffany started to giggle.

�So all that bitchy treatment from you towards all of us was just to get us to dislike you enough to over ride our conscience and want to get some revenge?�

Vivian stood up and threw her arms in the air, �Yes!&nbsp; By Jove!&nbsp; I think she&#8217;s got it� Both women broke up laughing, and toasted another round of drinks.

Vivian looked at the clock, �I think it&#8217;s time I called a taxi to go home.&nbsp; I have a bitch of a boss that is caning my arse at work, and she&#8217;ll be furious if I&#8217;m late getting in.�

Tiffany giggled, �She&#8217;ll cane your arse even if you&#8217;re on time.&nbsp; I&#8217;ll guarantee it!&nbsp; Why don&#8217;t you stay the night and we can go in together?�

Vivian looked at Tiffany, �I think I might have to tone down your subliminal massaging.&nbsp; Are you suggesting I sleep with you tonight?

Tiffany shuddered, �In your dreams you slut, not fucking likely! You&#8217;ll be on the couch I don&#8217;t want a degenerate cumsponge like you soiling my guest&#8217;s bedroom.�

Vivian giggled, �Ohhh my god, a couch!&nbsp; What luxury!&nbsp; But I&#8217;ll pass on it.&nbsp; I&#8216;ve kind of got used to the lumpy cum stained mattress on the floor, and looking at my clothes piled up in the corner of my sparsely equipped apartment.

Tiffany&#8217;s eyes frowned as she listened, �Not to mention the cold showers because I haven&#8217;t had the strength to force myself to suck that fat bastard of a landlord&#8217;s cock to get my hot water fixed.&nbsp; And the blisters on my feet from those CFM&#8217;s haven&#8217;t busted as yet, so I can still walk a few more mile in them.

Tiffany couldn&#8217;t hold her tongue any longer, �My apartment wasn&#8217;t all that bad you idiot, and I remember having a landlady?�

Vivian nodded, �You did, and it took me almost a month to find her another unit complex to manage when Fontaine Realty bought this complex.&nbsp; And before you ask the obvious question, yes another subsidiary of Bartrell.�&nbsp; 

�Jake the fat bastard was easy to find, but I got some strange looks when I had the lock to my front door broken.&nbsp; Since then most anything of value has been stolen, including the damn bed, but they did leave me the mattress.&nbsp; Probably only after jerking off on it, I&#8217;m pretty sure.&nbsp; My apartment now feels quite comfortable really!

Tiffany broke out laughing, �You are one fucked up bitch!�

Vivian was back in under the office desk working diligently away at Tiffany&#8217;s sex.&nbsp; When she entered Tiffany&#8217;s office, she didn&#8217;t know what the atmosphere would be like.&nbsp; Tiffany grinned at her, �Morning fuckwit!�&nbsp; Then she threw a pen at her, �Catch!� 

Vivian only just managed to catch the pen before it speared into her left tit, �What&#8217;s this for?�

�I want you to squat and as gracefully, and ladylike as you can manage, shove that pen up your not so tight arse!�

A plume of heat rushed to Vivian&#8217;s face and her clit tingled as she got down and with closed eyes inserted the pen.&nbsp; Looking up to Tiffany she asked meekly, �Now what Ms Carmichael?�

Tiffany giggled and threw five more pens at her, �You can reunite these with the one you already have in that disgustingly fat arse of yours!�

Vivian was sure that Tiffany could see the pussy slime dripping from her dangling cunt lips as she endeavoured to comply with Tiffany&#8217;s wishes, �When you finish that little task I have a surprise for you bitch.&nbsp; You can get under my desk and do what you&#8217;re employed to do.�

With half a dozen pens in her arse, Vivian crawled between Tiffany&#8217;s thighs and saw her pussy was red and swollen and very every wet, with tears of humiliating joy rolling down her cheeks, she clamped her mouth onto the object of her degradation and sucked and got her surprise, �Like creampies cunt?&nbsp; I dropped into a friends place for breakfast and a morning quickie this morning to fill up just for you.�

�Just think of the late great Trent Bartholomew and what he would be thinking of his putrid spawn.&nbsp; The sole heir to his ohhh so cherished empire, on her knees.&nbsp; Can you image him beating his breast in anguish at this scene; his offspring being professionally cuckolded by a mere underling, and made to suck cum from her well fucked pussy?�

 Vivian increased her efforts to bring Tiffany to climax, Ohhh god yes!&nbsp; Ohhh god, suck my cunt you putrid cum sucking slut!&nbsp; How do you feel being made to perform sexual atrocities for the sole amusement of the employees?&nbsp; How disappointing and pathetic you are to those who looked up to your father with respect and awe.&nbsp; Can you imagine him rolling over in his grave you fucking cumsucking maggot?�
 
Vivian&#8217;s nipple pained in responded to the vile taunts flowing from Tiffany&#8217;s mouth, as her own cum flowed down her thighs in buckets, her arsehole flexing around the pens and bucking her hips as she sucked an unknown man&#8217;s semen from her tormentor&#8217;s pussy.

�Still think I can&#8217;t supply your humiliation and degradation bitch?�&nbsp; Tiffany rapped her knuckles hard on top of Vivian head to keep her sucking.&nbsp; �Don&#8217;t you dare stop you pathetic slut until you&#8217;ve sucked all that cum right out on me!�Vivian couldn&#8217;t reply to Tiffany and her question.&nbsp; She was far too deep in a world so peaceful, so serene she never wanted to come back.
 
Sabrina knocked briefly as she entered, �Morning Tiff!&nbsp; I see your getting your morning relaxation therapy early this morning.�&nbsp; She stepped back, stooped and took another look at the rear end sticking out from under the desk, �God damn it Vivian you pathetic cunt!&nbsp;&nbsp; Is that where all the fucking office pens are going?�&nbsp; She grinned evilly at Tiffany and winked, �Is that lowlife cuntrag trying to steal office supplies now?�&nbsp; She was pleased by the faint groan emanating from under the desk.

Tiffany looked up through dreamy eyes and smiled, �You have no idea Sabbie, wait till the cuntrag has done her job and I&#8217;ll fill you in on all the fantastic news.&nbsp; We are going to have so much fun that we&#8217;ll have applicants lining up at the door paying us to work here!�

Vivian shuddered through another orgasm and whimpered.
