Chapter 1. The relationship problem

�They�re an odd pair Charles. Weird, but
between them they come up with brilliant ideas and it is these ideas that makes
the business so successful.�

�You think they�ll get the project
completed on time then James?�

�Looks like it � if they don�t have a
mental breakdown first. In fact I�m not sure how long they�ll continue to work
together after the project finishes.�

�As bad as that? That will be a blow for
Robotics. You�ll find it difficult to replace them.�

James Wilmore, CEO Robotics Ltd and
Charles Kilburn his friend and fellow member sat in the quietly luxurious
surroundings of their Mayfair club. �Indeed it will, Charles. It�s peculiar the
way they are able to work together and fully co-operate with each other and
without any real friction on design and manufacture problems but they are so
totally at odds on a personal level. Of course the hours they�ve worked over
the last few weeks hasn�t helped. They were working twelve hour days, six days
a week for a month and then when the firm who were to supply the ready
manufactured components we planned to use, went out of business and wouldn�t
allow us to use their patented mechanism, they had to redesign a large part of
the whole robotic mechanism. Knowing the jobs of hundreds of workers depended
on getting the prototype to the trade show next weekend, they�ve put in even
more hours. For the last three weeks they�ve done fourteen to eighteen hour
days, virtually seven days a week. That would put a severe strain on any
relationship and especially one that was difficult in the first place. It seems
to have heightened her sense of formality and the correctness with which she
treats him and expects him to treat her that way in return. He�s reacted by
becoming more casual in his manner and dress so they�re drifting apart or
heading for a fight. She snubs him at every opportunity and while he appears to
ignore it, I know its all building up inside and it will soon explode if
nothing is done to defuse the situation.�

�You�ve tried to ease their load I
suppose.�

�Yes, indeed, but there is little enough
others can do to help. Much of what they do is made up on the spur of the
moment. Bob, at best does rough sketches on scrap paper and Melanie interprets
them in the CAD programme, adds her own ideas, makes workable drawings and
writes the specifications. All the others can do is get materials, some basic
machining, and do any chrome plating or spray paintwork. They don�t want anyone
else around when they�re brainstorming ideas so normally they are the only two
in their workshop.�

The pair under discussion were Melanie
Forster and Robert Canning, the research and development staff at Robotics Ltd.
Melanie at twenty-nine, dressed conservatively and neatly and always wore a
long skirt, never trousers. For most of the year she wore a jacket over the top
of an ironed blouse of a material sufficiently opaque to hide her bra. In the
six years they�d worked together, Robert had never had a glimpse of her
breasts. Her shoulder length, neatly brushed, dark hair curled under slightly
at the ends surrounded a pleasant oval face, a face devoid of make-up except
for a trace of pale lipstick. She spoke in a cultured voice and always used
distinct, clear language but when addressing Robert, there was a certain amount
of scorn in her voice. Leaving engineering school with an honours degree she
quickly showed her abilities to turn rough sketches into a working design on
the computer and James hired her immediately.

Robert on the other hand, although able
to use the computer, had a more practical approach. His mind preferred to see
the design evolve through quick sketches and simple mock-ups. Likewise, his
dress was the antithesis of Melanie�s. Open necked plaid shirt and overalls
changed twice a week sufficed especially when they worked so many hours there
was little time to fit in doing the washing. He was about five years older than
his co-worker and had served an apprenticeship in the toolroom before getting
promoted to the design shop when Melanie was appointed. Physically he was
pretty much Mr. Average. Medium height, perhaps an inch taller than Melanie,
and through the work he did, was fairly fit if a little on the thin side. An
uneasy relationship existed between them but he enjoyed the work and generally
put up with the taunts from his partner.

�For example,� James went on, �Last
Wednesday evening I worked late too and went out and bought Chinese take-aways
for all of us. I put them on the design room table and we sat around it to eat
but immediately she sat down Melanie wrinkled her nose and said in her snooty
way, �Robert, would you be so kind as to move further away. The oil on your
overalls does smell so badly.� I hadn�t really noticed it, certainly it wasn�t
noticeable over the smell of the food, and I wondered if she really did or if
she was just baiting him. Bob, most of us call him that, only she calls him
Robert, moved his chair and made the �fuck-you� sign with his fingers without
her seeing it. I have a feeling that a volcanic-like eruption might occur
between them once the project is done.�

�Is there anything you can do to prevent
it?� Charles asked.

�Well, I thought they would both need a
holiday so plan on giving them a couple of weeks off and a bonus of course, but
I couldn�t think of anything else. Have you any ideas?�

Charles was silent for a while and then
hesitantly spoke, �Have you heard of the Relationship Therapy Clinic?� James
shook his head and shook it again when Charles explained it to him.

�It seems to me, James, that you don�t
have a lot of choice. If they go their separate ways for a fortnight, when they
come back they are just as likely to hate the other�s foibles more than they do
now rather than to tolerate them. He�ll have time to think about what a bitch
she is and she�ll see him as being even more uncouth and it will be exacerbated
by the fact there will be less for them to do for the following few weeks until
the next major design project comes on line. In that period, you could lose one
or both of them and they are both key people in your organisation.�

�I know that, but I don�t know if the
clinic is the answer, Charles, if it doesn�t work, I will lose them anyway.�

�But there�s a bigger chance that it will
work. Come, let�s see if there is a computer free in the IT room and look at
the web site, I�ll phone Lord Howarth to get the password. I know he obtained
one because he sent his daughter and her husband there when they were having
marriage problems.� We can see what else
it will tell us and see if there are places available. It�s pretty expensive
but far less than the loss of your top staff.�

&nbsp;

Chapter 2. Introduction to the clinic

�I thought Jim Wilmore appreciated us
more than this. We get four days to ourselves and then told to report to his
office only to be sent to a therapy clinic in the wilds of Yorkshire. I would
have recuperated better on a beach somewhere warm,� Bob grumbled as Melanie
drove them northwards along the M1.

�For once I quite agree with you Robert.
I would rather have spent more time quietly at home reading or doing a
cross-stitch embroidery to relax. Now it seems we are to undergo some form of
counselling I would guess although it was odd that I couldn�t get into their
web site. The instructions Mr. Wilmore gave us from the clinic were a little odd
too. One small case and a few personal effects. From that I suspect we will
only be there a day or two.� She glanced at Robert and then went on, �I would
fully have expected that in the few days you have had at home, you might have
found time to have a haircut and a beard trim, or even a shave but perhaps this
Relationship Therapy will help you to look after your appearance a little
better.�

Bob bit back his reply and only said it
inside his head, �Perhaps it will help you to be less of a snotty bitch!�

They travelled in silence for a while.
Because parking space at the clinic was limited, they�d been requested to
travel in one car and Melanie had decided her Rangerover was far more suitable
for the distance than Robert�s Ford, so she was driving. Eventually after
negotiating a web of narrow, dry-stone wall lined lanes they arrived at the
clinic.

�A most impressive building in a
delightful setting. The lake looks beautiful in the afternoon sunshine,�
Melanie commented.

�It�s a tarn,� Robert corrected, �In this
part of England, the lakes are called tarns and the building would have been
the residence of a coalmaster or ironmaster built during the industrial
revolution when coal was black gold and everyone wanted cast iron.�

�Thank you for the information Robert, I
will try and remember it next time. Now perhaps you will be kind enough to get
my case out of the boot please.�

�If this is a small case, I�d hate to
think what she would take on a real holiday,� Robert muttered as he hefted the
cases up the steps into the foyer.

Miss Melanie Forster and Mr. Robert
Canning, I believe we are booked in here for a few days,� Melanie primly
announced their arrival to Julie, the girl whose name was displayed on the desk
in a small office to one side of the entrance hall.

Julie looked up and then typed the
information into her computer. �Ah yes, but you should have been here twenty
minutes ago. Doctor Henry won�t like that. You will be awarded ten penalty
points for lateness. And it looks as if one of you didn�t follow the instructions
you were given to bring only one small case��

�After a journey of some two hundred
miles to a place hidden in the depths of nowhere, I would thought twenty
minutes adrift was pretty close to being punctual,� Melanie started to
scornfully berate the girl, �And as for my case, we have not been told how long
our stay will be so I did need to bring sufficient clothes for several days.
You surely do not expect me to wear the same clothes for more than one day, do
you Miss Julie?�

�No indeed.� Julie grinned, �Now if you
will just sign the guest book, I will have you escorted to your room. Room 103
on the first floor.�

�Which room am I in?� Robert asked
already half suspecting the answer.

�Same room of course. This is a
relationships therapy clinic.�

�You surely are not expecting me to sleep
in the same room as Robert?� Melanie�s face flushed at her outburst.

Julie grinned widely. �In the same room
and in the same bed, Mel.�

�It�s Melanie or Miss Forster to you, and
I certainly will not demean myself by sleeping with Robert. In fact I will not
be staying here. I�m leaving now and if this is Mr. Wilmore�s idea of a reward
for the work we put in, then I will not be returning to his employment either.
Are you coming Robert?� She turned only to find two muscular men blocking the
doorway. They didn�t move when she tried to brush passed them.

�I�m sorry Miss Forster, you are booked
to stay here for treatment for at least seven days but no longer than fourteen.
The actual length of time will depend on how well you respond to therapy,�
Julie mockingly told her. �John and David will escort you to your room and I
suggest you do exactly what they tell you. You have already amassed quite a few
punishment points, points that will be shared equally between you and Bob so
you must expect to go to bed with a sore bum, even if you don�t accumulate any
more. Bob, I suggest you try and curb Mel�s reluctance to conform to our rules.
Dr. Henry will visit you in your room shortly and will explain things in more
detail to you.�

�Can you tell us what all this is about
please miss?� Bob asked, �It a bit bewildering to me and I am sure it is to
Melanie because we didn�t book to come here and we had no idea of what was
expected of us. As Melanie suggested, this was supposed to be a reward for a
lot of extra work we put in at work.�

�By the end of your stay, we expect that
you will see it as a reward but Henry will explain it all. Just do as you are
told however difficult it may seem at first.�

�I will do no such thing miss. Now please
tell these men to allow us to pass and we can head back home and�� Melanie
didn�t finish the sentence. �Put me down! You�ve no right� Oooww!!� David
picked her up, tossed her over his shoulder and carried her from the room. When
she protested and tried to kick his hard hand found her arse.

At John�s command, Robert struggled to
carry Melanie�s overweight case and his own, up the stairs into their room.
Gratefully he pulled it along on its wheels for the last few yards and almost
collapsed into a chair. �Please put them in the bottom locker there and close
the door, Bob,� John instructed. As soon as he�d shut the door, Bob realised
there was no way of opening it again without a key. Seeing the look on his face
John explained, �There�s nothing in them that you will need for several days.
There�s a wide selection of toiletries in the bathroom and you will not need
clothes for a while.

�You don�t mean�?� Melanie�s voice showed
her emotion. Bob stood and went towards her but the two men caught his wrists
and handcuffed them behind his back. 

�Sit down Bob and enjoy the view.�
Turning to Melanie, John quietly ordered her to undress.

�You surely do not mean for me to undress
in front of three men Sir. That is a totally indecent suggestion and one I
cannot obey. Is it not bad enough to be held prisoners�� 

Melanie�s retort was cut short by John.
�Either you undress yourself or we will do it for you. That way we get to
fondle your body but it might also mean that some of your expensive looking
clothes get damaged. Either way, in five minutes you are going to be naked and
will remain that way for the next few days at least. You have three minutes to
undress yourself, after that Dave and I will forcibly strip you. Make up your
mind but don�t take too long in doing it.�

�This is disgraceful, I will certainly
report this to the authorities when I return home and see that this place is
closed down.� Nevertheless when she looked at the two muscular men, she decided
that discretion was the best option and slowly removed her jacket, and then
hesitantly her skirt and blouse, shoes and stockings. Each item she carefully
folded and placed on the bed. She just could not bring herself to take off her
bra and knickers. Crossing her arms over her breasts she looked defiantly and
the John and David who, without a word, grabbed her and wrenched her knickers
down and quickly unclasped her bra. Melanie struggled and cursed the men in a
wholly unladylike manner but the men just smiled at her. They had the upper
hand.

Bob sat spell bound. Never in his wildest
dreams had he expected to see Melanie totally nude and held on open display for
him. While she was undressing, he�d wondered whether he should intervene but
logically he accepted that there was nothing he could do. His hands were
cuffed, he was puny compared to the two men and he thought it time the high and
mighty Miss Melanie Forster, was brought down to earth. �I never expected her
to be so good looking under the clothes she normally covers herself with,� he
mused, �And certainly I never expected to hear that language from her.�
However, when the tears began to flow he felt sorry for her but that didn�t stop
him gazing at her pubic mound and her tits.

Dave asking, �Will you behave if we
remove the cuffs?� interrupted his reverie, �I daresay you can guess what
you�ll have to do afterwards.� 

�There�s no point in saying no,� he
replied evenly, �And I guess you�ll want me starkers too.� He undressed at his
normal pace and tossed each garment haphazardly on the bed. He left his
underpants until last and wondered what Mel would think of his prick being hard
and erect. He wondered if she�d even seen one before. Dave led him so he stood
directly in front of where Melanie sat. She tried to look away.

�Take a good look Mel. You�ll be seeing
it a feeling it a good deal in the coming days.� John�s statement brought
further tears to her eyes and she only felt the cuff being put on her right
wrist when it was snapped shut. To her horror she was linked to Robert�s left
wrist by a light chain, a chain about two feet in length.

A knock on the door announced the arrival
of two well built women. �This is Lucy and this is Sarah,� John introduced the
pair, �They will mostly be responsible for your punishment. I guess they�re
here to deliver their first session now. Dave, would you mind locking these
clothes away because I expect the bed will be required in a few minutes.� 

Melanie and Bob both looked in awe at the
two uniformed ladies, and particularly at the leather strap each carried.

Lucy spoke. �Bob and Mel, in the short
time you�ve been here you seem to have gained a good number of punishment
marks. Twenty minutes late, ten swats, massively overlarge case ten swats,
abuse of reception staff, twenty swats, threatening to leave, twenty swats. Any
more I should add for their time in here boys?�

�Mel refused to fully undress and treated
us to more threats and abuse. About thirty�s worth I would think,� John
replied.

�Ninety all told, that�s forty-five each.
Rather a lot for the first time. How about if we make it thirty each, that�s
being very lenient but I understand they were not informed of the rules here
before they came. Would you agree to them being let off lightly boys?� The boys
made a show of reluctance before finally agreeing. Lucy then made sure Bob and
Mel fully understood her lenience and the fact that although Mel had been
awarded most of the penalty points, the total was always shared between them.
�It�s part of your learning to live together and looking out for each other and
caring for each other,� Lucy explained before ordering the boys to bend the
pair side-by-side over the edge of the bed. They did so and then climbed on the
bed so they could easily hold their victims to the bed by kneeling on their
shoulders and their cries would, to some extent, be muffled by the bed linen.

With left handed Sarah to Bob�s right
side and Lucy on the other side of Mel, the pair simultaneously brought their
straps down with only moderate force on the exposed buttocks. Mel cried out
loudly and threatened them with dire consequences when she was finally able to
get home, but Bob gritted his teeth. By the tenth stroke Mel howled and by the
twentieth, she was begging them to stop and Bob started to groan at each
stroke. When the final one landed both had tears running down their cheeks and
Mel was begging to be sent home and still threatened to call the authorities as
soon as she was able.

�There�s a bathroom through there,� Lucy
indicated, �Have a shower and wash each other. There�s also an antiseptic cream
in the tray which you can use on each other. Don�t try and use it on
yourselves. We�ll pop is and see how you get on and if we find you are not
helping one another, we�ll give you the fifteen that you should have had this
time and add more penalty marks for your next session. Be ready for Dr. Henry
at six-thirty � you know the penalty for lateness and she will explain the
therapy programme to you and then take you to the dining room for dinner at
seven. Don�t take any nonsense from her Bob, remember it�s your arse that will
feel the strap as well as hers.� With that they left, locking the door behind
them.

&nbsp;

Chapter 3. The therapy explained

�C�mon Mel, lets see what the shower is
like.�

�Melanie! You don�t think I�m going in
there with you when you�re in that state, Robert.� She indicted his erection.

Bob�s placid nature was being sorely
stretched. �Can�t you see we�ve no option unless you want both of us to get
another thrashing? At the moment there seems no way of escape and neither of us
are any sort of match for John and David. Showering together is not going to
hurt either of us; not showering will.�

�No. We shouldn�t be forced to do things
we find so totally objectionable.�

�Right, then forced you will be.� Bob
grabbed her around the waist and carried her squealing and crying into the
bathroom. �Look into that mirror Mel. Without your fine clothes you�re no
better than me. For a man, my body is just as good as yours is for a woman. Now
look at my arse. Most of those stripes are because of you and your ways and if
you think I am going to let you add to them, think again. For the time being, I
doubt we have time to fuck so let�s get washed and dried and some cream on our
bums.� Deliberately he used the crudest terms and didn�t wait for a reply
before fiddling with the shower controls.

As they�d been told, the bathroom was
well equipped with toiletries and when the water was at the right temperature
Bob dragged Mel in and, ignoring her protests, lathered a lily with shower gel
and started to wash her face and then the rest of her body. The chain
connection made it an awkward operation and for a while, Mel tried to resist
but in the end, she gave up and just stood still and allowed him to wash her.
She reprimanded him when he spent too long on her breasts and pubic area but
otherwise she acquiesced. Only the thought of further pain stopped her from
protesting. However, her washing of him was at best perfunctory until she saw
Lucy, strap in hand, in the doorway. 

�You�ve ten minutes to dry each other and
put cream on,� Lucy informed them.

Bob hustled his partner out of the shower
and vigorously started to dry her and then gave her the towel. With two minutes
to spare he found the cream and sploshed it over her welts and she, rather more
carefully applied some to his. The clock chimed 6:30 as he pulled Melanie back
into the bedroom and hardly had they entered the room, when the door opened and
a woman in a white overall came in.

�Good evening Bob, good evening Mel, I�m
Doctor Henrietta Coburn but everyone calls me Henry. I�m in charge of your
therapy.�

�Why is it that no one in this place will
use my proper name?� Melanie asked in an annoyed voice, �And I assume you are
the one responsible for ordering us to be kept chained and naked like this and
held prisoner here. Why when we didn�t want your therapy in the first place?
Why cannot you release us now? And��

�Whoa a minute Mel� Henry grinned, �One
question at a time. First though, sit on the bed and I�ll explain it to you
until it is time to go down for dinner. Probably it will be a good idea to put
a towel down first to stop the cream from soiling the bedclothes.�

�I don�t want dinner, I want my clothes
and freedom!�

�You�ll get that after ten or fourteen
days, not before and by that time we hope that you will enjoy your time here.�

�What after you�ve thrashed us into
submission?�

�Shut up for a minute Mel. Let�s hear
what the lady has to say,� Bob interrupted. Melanie sighed loudly and shrugged
as if to say, �Get on with it then.�

�Thank you Bob. First if we call you
Melanie and everyone else by their shortened or nickname, that would make you
appear superior to the others, which you are not. That is also the reason you
are naked. Your body is no better than Bob�s and his no better than yours so
again, that makes you equal in status. It seems that at work, you have tried to
make Bob appear very inferior except when actually doing a job. Now I gather
from your boss you are both paid exactly the same wages and because of your
contributions to the firm, the wages are higher than the usual rate for the
work you do. However, Jim Wilmore noticed that you Mel, treated Bob, to use
Jim�s words, �like you were the lady of the manor and he were a serf who lived
in a wattle and daub hut and was rarely allowed in the manor and then only by
the back door.� Would you say that was a fair description Bob?�

�I would have put it rather more crudely
but that gives a far better picture,� Bob replied seriously.

�Jim could foresee you wouldn�t put up
with it for all that much longer and sooner or later, one or both of you would
leave and Robotics would go downhill.�

�I�m certainly not going back to that
firm when I finally get out of this place,� Melanie spoke forcibly.

Henry ignored her and went on, �So when
we were recommended he decided this was a kill or cure situation and booked you
in and your therapy is all paid for so we are obliged to give you the full
treatment and not allow you to leave early. I am confident that by the end of
the week you will have learned to live together socially.�

�And that means sleeping with him and
being raped!�

�No Mel, you will not be raped. If he
rapes you, he�ll be caned severely and from the information I�ve had, I think
it unlikely that he will do that. He will be allowed to fondle, titillate and
masturbate you until you want him to do it but until you ask him, his prick
must not enter your cunt or arse. In turn you can try and arouse him. Being
linked will mean that you will be with him the whole time. There will be no
privacy for either of you. Not when you wash or use the toilet. At first it
will be totally aggravating and annoying but as you learn to live together, so
it should get easier.�

�And do the punishments get easier?� Bob
asked.

�They should get less frequent but they
will always be shared. Sorry Bob, you have been taking more than your share of
those so far but the reason for them is to make you both try and think of one another
and not just of yourselves. Any adverse actions from one will mean sore arses
for both. Most punishments will be no more serious than the one you�ve had
unless you commit a serious offence like rape or attacking a member of my
staff.�

Mel burst into tears and started to wail,
�I want to go home! I want to go home!� Bob put his arm around her but she
immediately shook it off. Not to be denied, Bob did it again and this time held
her too tightly for her to release herself.

�Dinner�s in five minutes. I�ll leave you
two together for now. Try to dry your tears Mel, John and David will be in
shortly to escort you to the dining room. Don�t worry about your nudity,
there�ll be others dressed as you are.�

&nbsp;

Chapter 4. Rebellion

In the event, it was Lucy and Sarah that
came for them. �Come along now. Time for dinner and for you to meet the others
and let�s have no nonsense from you in the dining room because that will only
result in a public punishment,� Lucy warned.

�I don�t want any dinner, leave us
alone,� Melanie answered defiantly. Bob could feel the anger seething within
her as she again shook herself free of his grasp and leaving them only
connected by the chain.

Lucy�s strap caught her across her
breasts and then Bob felt the pain as Sarah�s hit his shoulders. Mel screamed
loudly and Bob said icily, �There was no need for that.� Despite the calm
words, he felt his anger at their treatment growing but he tried to control
himself. Ignoring the remark, Lucy ordered them to go downstairs, her raised
strap indicating she would not hesitate to use it again.

Clasping Melanie�s hand Bob pulled her to
the door. �Mel, we don�t have the whip hand yet but when we do, we�ll get this
place closed down and this lot sent to prison. Until then we have to do as they
say. In any case with my prick sticking up like it is, it will be more
embarrassing for me than for you.� Mel glanced at his prick and blushed.

The embarrassment was even worse than he
imagined. The eyes of five other couples and the staff were upon them as they entered
the room. Melanie still cried loudly and ignored the instructions to quieten
down when they were introduced to Gerry and Kate, their table companions. Kate
stood and greeted them. �Good evening Mel, nice to meet you,� and went to shake
Mel�s hand not realising that it was connected to Bob. The chain caught the
water jug and upset its contents over the table before rolling on to the floor
and smashing into thousands of tiny fragments.

�You stupid fucking cow!� Melanie
screamed. Bob had never heard her use language like that before. �Do you really
think we want to be in this torture chamber with their Gestapo guards ready to
thrash us at the slightest whim. I�ll see the lot of you put away before I�m
done.�

Bob felt Sarah�s hands on his shoulders
and saw John and David heading their way, closely followed by Dr. Henrietta.
�Time to make a stand. If I�m going to get a thrashing, it will be for
something I�ve done and not because of Mel,� he muttered. �Aaahh!� he groaned
as Sarah�s strap hit his shoulders and he heard Melanie scream too. Quickly
assessing the situation and noting the table was only a few feet from the wall,
he swung his right fist and caught Sarah fully in the stomach. She fell back
against Lucy and for a second no one was holding them. Immediately Bob tipped
the table on its side spilling all the plates and cutlery to the floor to join
the glass and other debris, and then dragged the table back so it formed a
small barrier between them and the would be attackers. The wall protected their
backs but even so, out numbered and with superior strength on their side, he
knew the there was little doubt as to the outcome. �You ready to really fight
Mel?� 

�Yes!�

The surprise of upsetting of the table
brought a temporary halt to Lucy and Sarah�s attack and even John and David
paused in their progress towards them. Picking up two table knives and handing
one to Mel, he said loudly, �If we�re going to be thrashed, well give them good
cause and if there are injuries that need an ambulance, then the police will be
involved and all this will be investigated.�

�Leave them for a moment.� Henry�s
authorative voice pierced the hubbub. Slowly she walked towards the couple.
�There�s no need for this Robert. We�re here to help you��

�You just want to beat us into submission
to satisfy your sadistic tendencies. You just want to control a lot of slaves.�
Melanie hissed. To Bob�s surprise she went on in a loud voice, �Now�s the time
for all you slaves to revolt. If we all rebel against these so-called
therapists, we can take control and go home without any more beatings. Rise up
and show your support for us.� None made any move to help them. 

For a fleeting moment Henry looked
worried but then she smiled, �Looks like you�re still on your own Mel.�

Unfortunately, she leaned a little too
close to the pair. Seeing the opportunity Bob arced his left hand around her
head and the chain linking him to Mel wrapped and tightened around her throat.
There were gasps of horror from the watchers and a movement towards them. �Keep
back,� Bob warned, �We�ve no wish to hurt her but sudden movements could have
drastic consequences. We�re just taking her hostage until we�re released from
this torture clinic.� Henry tried to speak but nothing came out except a
gurgling sound. Her hands tried to loosen the chain to allow her to breathe
properly but she couldn�t get a grip on it. �We�ll take her to our room and try
and get our clothes so we can get away,� Bob whispered to Mel. To the others he
announced, �We are taking her to our room to negotiate our release. She will
not be harmed unless you try to capture us. I gather some of you came here
voluntarily, which is why you wouldn�t support us; we were tricked into coming
and as you can tell, we strongly object to our treatment by our boss and we will
do all we can to escape. I repeat we don�t want to hurt Henry but we will if we
have to. Stay where you are while we make our way to find our clothes.�

Slowly and warily they made their way
around the wall to the door and to their room. Once inside Bob kicked a chair
against it, knowing that it wouldn�t keep anyone out for long. �Get the towel
from the bed Mel and we�ll use it to tie her up, so we are free to move around
again and find some way of cutting this chain.�

�The keys are in my pocket,� Henry
croaked when the chain loosened for a moment. Mel found them and released
herself while Bob still held the free end to keep control of his captive.

�Lock it on her wrist and then release me
please Melanie.� She did and then wound the chain around Henry�s body and
cuffed the other wrist. Henry effectively was handcuffed with her wrists
tightly behind her back.

�Good thinking Melanie.� It was almost as
if they were working on a project. Noises could be heard outside the door. �Is
there a door key with the others?� Melanie quickly found one and locked the
door and they could both turn their attention to Henry who was rotating her
head to free her neck muscles and looking at them with apprehension.

�What do you intend doing now?� she
asked, �It�s still going to be difficult for you to get away. None of my keys
fit the clothes locker and you would still have to get out of here to the door
and then find the keys to your car and get it out of the garage.�

�We do now have this!� Melanie gleefully
held up Henry�s mobile phone. �Nice, neat little thing I almost didn�t feel it
in your pocket.�

�Don�t phone the police please,�
Henrietta begged, �We do a lot of good work here but with you, it hasn�t even
had a chance to work out.�

�First I�m going to phone James Wilmore
and tell him what I think of his plan to make me socialise with Robert and then
terminate my employment with him so he won�t have any hold on us to continue
here.� 

Bob had never seen Melanie in the mood
before but for once he was on her side. �You can tell him to find someone to
replace me too Melanie. Better still, demand that he gets us released and then
we can walk out on him. We can treat his dirty tricks with a trick or two of
our own.�

�Good idea Robert.� From memory she
dialled James�s home number. 

Nancy, James� wife answered, �Good
evening, Wilmore residence.�

�Good evening Nancy, Melanie Forster
here, could I talk with that conniving worm you call your husband please?�

�Aren�t you supposed to be locked away in
some sanatorium or something? Jim said��

�Yes, we�re locked away but we hope for
not too much longer.�

�Sorry� I�ll get him.�

�Mr. Wilmore, I don�t know what you
expected to gain from having us incarcerated in this place and having us beaten
and humiliated but unless you tell them to release us at once, there will be
dire consequences for you and your family � and also Robotics Limited. We have
Dr. Coburn with us at the moment, you will kindly instruct her to free us from
this torture prison immediately before more harm is done to us or them. I�ll
hold the phone so you can speak with her.� 

What James said to her was lost to
Melanie and Bob, but Henry�s reply quashed any hope of an early release. �I am
not authorising their release at this time Jim. If I do you will lose all
chance of staying in your employ� Yes, they have me tied up at the moment but
there�s no way out for them� I daren�t release them yet and I don�t think I am
in any real danger� No, it is in both our interests to continue with the
therapy.�

Both Melanie and Robert were disappointed
by the conversation, more so when David�s voice came through the door. �Shall
we break the door down Henry, before they phone the police?�

�Not for the moment Dave. Not unless you
actually see her dial.� Bob looked around the room and his eyes stopped on one
of the two spycams. �Yes, Bob, they�re watching us like we watched you earlier.
Now perhaps we can talk quietly and without the necessity of damaging the nice
panelled door. I�ve no doubt they have the ram ready and could be in here in a
second or two. I would be released and you would be restrained again.�

�Maybe so, but I think I speak for Mel as
well when I say that you will not take us without a fight and someone could get
seriously hurt. As a therapist you will know what happens when people are
pushed passed their limit and we�re just about on ours and as I see it, we�re
likely to be severely punished for what we�ve done so far unless you�ve power
enough to restrain the goons outside.�

�And if we�re beaten severely the marks
will show for a long while and then it will be grievous bodily harm. I still
think getting the police here will be the best bet for us.� Melanie gave her
opinion. �If I go into the bathroom, can you fend them off for long enough for
me to make the call Bob?� He nodded and then noticed she�d called him Bob for
the first time.

The only weapon he could find was the
toilet brush but he�d hardly time to pick it up when the door splintered and
David and John rushed in and disarmed him. Melanie too was grabbed and relieved
of the phone before she�d had time to get through. Once again they were
helpless prisoners.

&nbsp;

Chapter 5. Punished again

�Shall I get the cane?� Lucy asked

�I don�t think so.� Henry seemed to be
considering her options. �Take them dining room and make them clear up the mess
they made and then take them to the lounge where the rest of the guests are and
give their arses a good strapping. Don�t spare them and let everyone witness
it; they all saw what happened and a few might have thoughts on trying
something similar. When they�ve had what you consider sufficient punishment,
take them to the loo and put them in the padded cell for the night. No dinner
and only water to drink while they�re in the loo.�

Bob fury at the unjustness of it all,
rose and, although handcuffed he managed to free himself from John�s grip and
head down, charged at Henry, catching her at breast level and knocking her to
the floor and leaving her gasping for breath. In the confusion, Melanie was
able to kick John in the testicles hard enough to make him cry out. The fight
lasted only a few seconds before hands grabbed and restrained them again.

�Do what you need to do to keep them
under control. Treat them like real prisoners,� Henry gasped, her composure now
gone. 

�Encouraged� by Lucy and Sarah wielding
their straps the pair were forced to the dining room. Most of the guests had
left and the few that remained Dave ordered to leave. A girl waitress was
attempting to clear up the debris. �You can leave the rest, this pair are going
to clear it up for you.� Dave sent the girl back to the kitchen while John
released the Bob and Mel�s cuffs. �Don�t think of trying any more stupid
tricks, you�re in enough trouble as it is.�

�You�re the ones in trouble,� Melanie
hissed, �This place will be closed down before the end of the month.� The
outburst earned her more lashes with the strap. Collapsing on the floor, she
wept bitterly. Bob lay on top of her covering her body with his, and clasped
his arms tightly around her, seemingly heedless of the beating he was taking
from Sarah. Mel�s body curled underneath him, felt warm against his flesh as
she instinctively held him tight.

�Are we fighting this together?� Bob
whispered in Mel�s ear.

�All the way,� came the answer. 

Despite attempts to separate them and
continued strokes of the straps, neither released their grip on the other until
Bob finally blacked out. His back, buttocks and thighs covered with an
interwoven network of welts. Water sprinkled over his face brought him round.
Opening his eyes again he saw Melanie looking very worried and Henry standing
with a cruel smile on her face.

�Well it looks as if you have got out of
clearing up but not from the rest of your punishment. Give them a dozen apiece
with the cane Lucy please. Do it in the lounge in front of the others. We�ll
cure this rebelliousness once and for all.�

�Are you sure they can take that Henry?�
Lucy asked, �They�ve both had to take a lot of punishment already and Bob�s
taken a lot more trying to protect Mel.�

�Do it! Do it or find another job!�

John and David roughly manhandled the
feebly struggling, handcuffed pair into the lounge. Bob could only walk with
support and Melanie was not much better. Much of the fight had gone from them
and the pain was beginning to shut down their reactions. Melanie�s anger again
surfaced and through her tears and crying, appealed to the guests, �Are you
still going to sit and watch us being punished for something we haven�t done?
Are you such lily-livered mice that cannot stand up to them and help us? Can�t
you see we�ve been tortured enough?� There were murmurs of disapproval at their
treatment but no one stood up to help.

Adrenalin flowing again produced a
renewed burst of energy in Bob. With John and David holding his arms to prevent
any escape, he used their support to lift both feet and kicked. Deliberately he
toppled an ornamental stand and sent its oriental vase crashing to the floor.
The force of his kick caught his captors by surprise causing them to
momentarily lose their grip. Bob ended up on the floor as well kicking a
cursing everyone in sight.

Melanie, not to be outdone, kicked and
screamed too but Lucy and Sarah had better control of her and her kicks were
ineffective but still they caused enough of a problem to delay the caning,
further infuriating Henry. 

Again there were murmurs of discontent
from the guests but still none offered any help or tried to stop the
punishment. Inevitably, Bob and Mel found themselves bent of the back of a
settee, their arses positioned nicely for the coming punishment. Both bodies
well punished already and while Lucy went to fetch the canes, Henry tried to
calm the others with a little speech but Bob and Mel continually interrupted
her until she threatened to gag them. By that time Lucy had returned with two
supple rattan canes. �It is rare for us to have to use these on guests but the
appalling behaviour of this pair has made a stricter punishment necessary. I
earlier ordered a dozen strokes each but seeing they have smashed a valuable
vase I think we ought to double that.�

A deep voice from somewhere in the
background asked, �Have you lost sight of the purpose for their being here
Henry?�

It was obvious to everyone that she had
and was more concerned about her lack of control and getting her revenge for
what they�d done. �No! And I�ll thank you not to question my authority in this
matter.� Again more whispered comments. �Get on with it. Cane them and cane
them hard. That�s what I pay you to do and you�ve so often said how you hated
having to go gentle with most of the strappings you do. Go on, do it!� Despite
their misgivings, Lucy and Sarah swung the canes and brought horrendous screams
from the recipients when they connected with their already tender and welted
buttocks. Melanie pissed herself but she didn�t notice.

�They won�t take twenty-four like that
without hospital treatment,� Lucy whispered. Sarah nodded and the next eleven
were given with less force. They still brought excruciating pain and left vivid
welts until, by the time the first dozen were up, both were barely conscious.

Lucy put down her cane and looked at
Henry but it was the man who�d spoken earlier that spoke. �That�s enough. Any
more will do them serious harm and any more will cause a riot in this room.
They need treatment now before we all suffer because of it. From what I
understand, they didn�t even volunteer to come here.�

�Take them to the padded cell, I will
speak with them later.� Henry�s voice showed her anger at being thwarted but
even she realised they couldn�t take any further punishment without injury. 

Lucy and Sarah defied their employer and,
with David and John�s assistance, took them to their room and laid them face
down, side-by-side on the bed. �We�ll do what we can to ease your pain but it
will be little enough. Never before have we had to punish any couple anywhere
near as badly. We should have defied her earlier but I got carried away too.�
Lucy sounded very remorseful but the pair were in too much pain to heed her
words.

&nbsp;

Chapter 6. That night

Henry was furious when she heard that her
orders has been disregarded and the pair were in the comfort of their room and
not in the cell, however, her approach to them was barred by John and David and
by two of the guests. If anything this increased her anger but when she tried
to force her way passed, John held her firmly and spoke quietly to the others.
All were in agreement. �It will be for her own good,� a guest commented as
eager hands stripped the struggling woman and carried her to the padded cell. �You�re
sacked! Leave me be and get off the premises. Let me GO!� Ignoring her verbal
abuse they dumped her in the cell and locked the door. She would spend the
night there instead of Bob and Mel. They hardly understood what was going on.

�Take these,� Kate, the guest they�d met
earlier, spoke quietly, �I always bring some painkillers with me when we come
here and they do help to relieve the pain a bit but I�ve never had more than a
dozen strokes of the strap at one time and that�s mainly when Gerry tries to
mess up. Nothing like what they did to you. Maddy has brought some juice for
you and will help me lift you up a little so you can drink it. I know it will
hurt a little but you need to make up the water you�ve lost and for the pills
to work. They�re prescription pills so they�re pretty strong. Don�t ask how I
get them�� the woman prattled on without expecting or wanting an answer. �When
the pills have clicked in, we�ll get you both in the shower and clean you up.
That may make you feel better even if it doesn�t relieve the pain. Maddy�s got
some ointment that helps but its no good putting it on until you�ve been washed��

Through tearful eyes Bob didn�t resist
when the topless woman he seen at the dinner table gently lifted him enough to
sip the juice and for him to take the pills but he did cry out several times as
the movements pulled the badly swollen skin. Melanie too cried but, knowing
they were trying to help, at least she didn�t abuse the women. In any case, her
throat was so sore from the screaming she needed a drink.

The pills kicked in a quarter of an hour
later and, although moving was still painful, both were able to get into the
shower and to hold each other while the women carefully washed and dried them.
Maddy coated the worst places with the ointment she�d brought. Her touches to
Melanie�s breasts started to harden her nipples but Mel was too out of it to
notice. She did notice when Bob became aroused from Maddy�s attentions but
didn�t even comment on it. Maybe it was the pills or maybe it was such a minor
thing after everything else she�d gone through. The sight of his back did cause
her to gasp in horror at the state it was in and she remembered the way Bob had
tried to protect her from the lashes as they lay on the dining room floor.
�Drink some more juice before we put you to bed again. I think it will be best
if you lie on your sides because both of you have welts on your fronts as well
as your backs. We�ll put you facing one another so you can talk if you wish but
my guess is that the pills have already made you feel sleepy�� Kate kept up her
continuous stream of words but most of them didn�t register to the suffering
pair.

�Graeme wants all the guests to attend an
important meeting in the lounge to discus the situation. We�ll look after them
for a while.� Lucy and Sarah entered the room.

�No, don�t leave us alone with them,�
Melanie croaked and started to shake. Bob moved closer to her and gently put
his arm over her. For once she didn�t resist even though she could feel his
prick against her stomach. 

�Don�t worry, we�ve no straps and no cane
and we won�t touch you unless it is to help you. We both know we went too far
and should have ignored Henry�s orders much earlier and we�re very sorry but
we�ll give you a better apology when you have recovered enough to understand
it.�

�Yes, and if they hurt you, they�ll be on
the receiving end of their cane from the guests,� Kate commented as she left.

The pills did indeed make them sleepy and
for a couple of hours, they were dead to the world but as the effect began to
wear off, so their sleep became fitful and the pain started to return. Sometime
in the early hours of the morning, Melanie woke and found her body held close
to Robert�s and his prick pressed hard to her body. She could hear his steady breathing
and realised he was sleeping. Her first instinct was to push him away and then,
remembering how he�d protected her, she relaxed and found herself enjoying the
feel of him against her or at least she would have enjoyed it had the pain
allowed the sensation. �I wonder what it would be like to have his prick inside
me?� she wondered, �Would it be the climatic experience some of the college
girls boasted about? Or just more pain and the humiliation of being dominated
by a man? I know technically I am not a virgin, the exercise machines broke my
hymen years ago but I�ve never experienced a man. Just my fingers and the
little vibrator. You expected to a few years ago when you went out with Colin a
few times and you went on the pill just in case he got carried away, but you
never thought it might be Robert, or should I call him Bob now? No. Let
everyone else call him that. I�ll be different and use his proper name and
maybe he�ll continue using mine. Perhaps I have feelings for him now because I
know he cannot dominate me; cannot even do it to me until he heals. And I will
need to recover much more too.�

�Do you need anything Mel?� a strange
woman whispered, �Juice? Ointment?� 

�Some juice please,� she answered in a
hoarse whisper. Robert muttered something unintelligible but didn�t wake until
her movements when trying to drink it disturbed him. �Sorry Robert, I tried not
to wake you. How�s your pain?�

�Coming back but bearable.� His voice too
was very croaky and he gratefully accepted a carton of juice.

�Maddy left the salve but Kate said you
were not to have any more pills before six o�clock and that�s a couple of hours
or so yet,� the unknown woman told them. �Do you want to use the toilet?�
Neither of them wanted to move so they settled down again close to each other
and this time it was Melanie who reached over and lightly held Robert�s hand.
It gave rise to some unusual thoughts within him.

�Is she doing that because I protected
her or because she�s begun to have some feelings for me or because we�re both
in the same boat and need each other�s support? Will she still want to be near
me when we�re back at work? Is it likely that we will return to work? Not after
what Jim Wilmore has put us through. Still maybe it�s had some effect. She
never would have touched me before. I wonder if she�ll let me kiss her? No,
better wait until we can move better and I can hold her properly.� 

They dozed and when he awoke Melanie
still lay close by but was crying softly. Enough light came through the windows
to see the tears running down her face and without thinking, he put his arm
around her and cuddled her to him. The effort cost him more pain and Melanie
felt the pull on her muscles but after a few moments she relaxed and allowed
her breasts to lightly press into his chest. They were still very sore but she
tried not to cry out. It wasn�t long before Robert�s prick started to harden
and she felt it poke into her thigh. He tried surreptitiously to wriggle it
free but each movement hurt and he resigned to leaving it where it was, hoping
his partner didn�t complain or scream that he was going to rape her. Much to
his astonishment, she took hold of it and moved it to a more comfortable
position against her the side of her leg. She, Melanie Forster, took hold of
Robert Canning�s prick and moved it without a comment. Neither of them spoke
but each pondered over her action. She because it was the first prick she had
felt and the strange hard softness of it; he because of the uniqueness of her
even thinking about his feelings let alone the tender way in which she handled
him. Melanie almost couldn�t believe she�d done it, nor could she understand
the wetness she felt flowing in her crotch.

Dr. Henry didn�t spend a comfortable
night either and if anything had even less sleep. The padded cell floor might
have been soft compared to normal materials but it was still far harder than
her normal bed. She�d had it built to confine recalcitrant guests, either in
complete darkness or with the pale blue light that was on now. Normally guests were
confined for an hour or two only, just long enough for them to calm down. She
correctly guessed that she would be confined until morning and without her
watch, the time would seem even longer.

At first she sat with her back to the
wall and cursed, cursed Mel and Bob, her staff and the guests. She even cursed
herself for being a fool and allowing herself to be persuaded to take in Mel
and Bob without interviewing them first and giving them some idea of the
regime. That was a large part of the problem, she admitted to herself. They
came here not knowing what to expect and not wanting to even try to patch up
their relationship. Slowly she calmed down and began to assess the situation
more objectively and to try and find a way out of it without closing the place
down, or worse, ending up in prison. Reluctantly she had to admit that she was
at least partly at fault, that she let her anger override her better judgement.
�What I need to do now is a damage limitation exercise. I�ll need to apologise
but that may not be enough, if I were in their shoes it would hardly be a
start. I�d want blood. Still the therapy must have partially worked. He was
doing what he could to protect her and she allowed him to be in close contact
with her, indeed at times she tried to press herself tightly against him. Maybe
if we can keep them here long enough and they start to fuck each other and
enjoy it, maybe they can be persuaded not to go to the authorities. I�m sure
many of the guests won�t want to be involved in that either so maybe in this
they will side with me even though they disagree with the severity of the
caning. I know I shouldn�t have ordered the cane; the straps would have been
more than sufficient. I lost my cool when I should have kept it but they went
far beyond any resistance I have known before and after the way they almost
strangled me, I wanted revenge. Again perhaps extreme resistance was due to not
knowing a little about the therapy before they came.�

So the debate within her head continued
without coming to any firm conclusions. Much would depend on whether or not her
staff and guests fell behind her again. If they didn�t, there was little hope.

The night dragged on and on and she fully
believed it to be mid morning when John and David opened the cell door but it
was still only 6:30 a.m. �Don�t say anything Henry. For the time being you are
suspended from your post and a small committee has been set up to try and
resolve the situation. Graeme has been elected chairman of the committee and
has convened a meeting at nine. We are to take you to your bathroom so you can
clean up but we are not allowing you to dress. For now you will be treated as
one of the patients or guests as we call them. Penalty points will be awarded
as per your system and Kate has agreed to allow her husband Gerry to partner
you so she can spend more time looking after Mel and Bob. You will behave with
him just as if you two were in a troubled marriage and that means sleeping and
having sex with him. Kate has agreed to all that and as you know Gerry often
volunteers for more punishment which is why they return so often. He will be
here shortly to help you shower but for now you can piss and shit etc. Here he
is now.�

�I hope I�m not late,� Gerry grinned,
�They only just informed me Henry was being released. Don�t want to collect
penalty points before I even start.� He almost bounced into the room, his
erection jutting ahead of his body.

�You�re okay so far Gerry. We�ll start
from now and remember she�s your replacement wife so do with her as you would
with Kate.�

�You can�t mean that I�ll have to�� Henry
began.

�I trust you weren�t going to object
Henry, you know the penalties. Besides that, you will need our cooperation if
this place is to remain open and one of the things that might help is for Bob
and Mel to see you treated as they�ve been treated. You�ll learn more of the
plan at nine. Dave will keep an eye on you for a little while then either us or
the girls will pop in from time to time to make sure you conform to your own
rules.� 

&nbsp;

Chapter 7. Recovery

�It�s okay Kate, they�re awake,� a male
voice whispered as Kate quietly entered the bedroom, �I�ve given them another
carton of juice but told them they had to wait until you came before they had
any more pills.�

�Thanks Billy, I�ll see to them now.
Normally I don�t even know this hour of the morning exists. 6:30! Yuckk!� She
went to the bed. �Would you mind if I put the light on so I can see how you are
faring, the light coming through the window isn�t very bright today. Looks like
it�s going to be one of those grey Yorkshire mornings.� Without waiting for a
reply she put the light on and kept up a flow of conversation while she
examined them. �They�re going to be painful for a while but I�ll do what I can
to alleviate it. First another couple of pills, not the same as last night
because they want you to attend a meeting later and you�ll need to be awake for
that. We�ll wait a quarter of an hour for the pills to take effect and then get
you to the toilet and shower. I know moving will hurt but you must try not to
let your muscles freeze up. It may seem cruel but it is actually for your own
good. Trust me. For now though, continue to hold and comfort each other. Have a
little cuddle but remember her tits are tender Bob.� Bob, seeing Kate�s bare breasts
in front of his face, quickly became erect but although both women saw it,
neither commented.

Kate pulled up a chair and gently rubbed
Bob�s thigh, �Did you know the pair of you have lost me my husband?� Bob looked
up sharply and saw the woman was smiling. �Yes, the committee took him away
from me and gave him to Henry for a few days. They�re giving her some of her
own treatment and she is now a guest here with Gerry, acting as her husband
which means he gets full marital rights. That will please him as he�s always
wanted to get his prick in her but until now she�s been aloof and untouchable.
She won�t like it though because she is a bit of a lesbo but if she objects,
she�ll get punishment points which of course she�ll share with him. He�s one of
those men that likes having their bum warmed and with me he has to try and
restrain himself because I�m not over keen on it. It�s okay in small doses and
when you�re not hit too hard but real punishment is nothing but pain, as you�ve
found out. Some women like it hard but not me. Henry won�t either. It�ll be the
first time anyone has seen her get a taste of the strap and it didn�t sound as
if she was very happy when they released her from the padded cell a little
while ago. I�m now a sort of freelance woman available to any man who wants me
and if his wife will let him. Don�t worry Mel, I won�t be taking your boyfriend
from you�� Melanie�s mind hardly registered the term and by the time it did
Kate had changed the subject. She prattled on with Bob and Mel only saying an
occasional word.

�Time now for you to move yourselves. You
first Mel, as you�re nearest me.� Melanie cried out when she had to move but
with Kate�s assistance, was able to stand and walk with slow steps. �You�ll
probably find it easier to stand over the pan with the seat up to piss dear.
Don�t worry if you make a mess. If you need to squat, support yourself on your
hands or ask for me to help support you.� Although she was disgusted at the
idea of standing to pee, Melanie saw the practicality of it. Bob, supporting
himself a little on Kate, hobbled painfully into the room before she�d finished
but looked away until she had vacated the loo. 

Melanie turned her back when it was Bob�s
turn to pee but Kate told her to turn back again and watch. �This is something
you need to know how to handle Mel. See here, his prick is rock hard and I
don�t know if it is because of you or me, but whatever it is, he�s going to
find it difficult to piss in the pan. What you do is this.� She gave it a sharp
flick just under the head and it deflated rapidly. �It�s a useful thing to know
but don�t use it just to stop him fucking you or because it is hard and you�re
embarrassed by it. And do take an interest in each other�s bodies, you�ll need
to see and feel them a lot in the next few days when you learn to put the cream
on each other and help each other to pleasure each other.�

�Will they let us go home now?� Melanie
asked.

�You�re in no fit state to go anywhere
dear. You can�t drive and you can�t even sit for long so it will be better for
you to stay here until you�re healed a lot more. I don�t know what this
morning�s meeting will decide but I expect you will be kept here as though you
were still on the therapy course but without the chain linking you and without
the penalty points. That�s only a guess. Now into the shower with you both and
take your time washing each other. Bob, as you can see Mel�s tits are very
tender from the strap but a gentle massage won�t hurt and her pubic mound has
missed the strap as has your prick so both of you, feel free to play with them
in a sexual way and maybe find a little natural pain relief and enjoyment that
way. Just like you would if you�d have come here voluntarily. I�ll help you to
start with but there will be times when I�m not around. I know you�ll be very
careful tending to each other�s backs and bums and I expect that by tonight
things will be easier but I doubt you�ll sit comfortably for a few days.� While
she was talking she slipped off her see-through blue gauze trousers and slippers
and entered the shower cubicle with them.

For a while they almost tuned out Kate�s
monologue until she started get them to practice the massaging of their sexual
parts. Melanie wanted to rebel when first Kate and then Bob gently rubbed her
breasts and then slowly she relaxed and allowed the pleasant sensations to take
over. �Now open your legs a little more Mel� That�s right, it won�t hurt.
You�ve no doubt done it to yourself many times but you�ll find it is much more
satisfying if someone else does it. For me, I prefer it to be a man but another
woman is good. Have you had a woman make love to you Mel?� Melanie�s face took
on a look of horror and she shook her head but by then Kate�s fingers were
working on her clit and she was instructing Bob. Although she tried not to,
under their ministrations, Mel climaxed and even with the water flowing over
her body, they knew she had from the little cry she gave and the way her face
blushed.

�Now it�s your turn to give Bob some
pleasure. We�ll start with a hand-job today and work up to a blow-job later
when you can bend a bit better.� She wrapped Melanie�s hand around Bob�s prick
and started her on wanking it. �Some men like it done harder than others but
for now, do what you�re comfortable with. Bob�s climax will be much more
visible and after all the stimulation he�s had playing with you, I�ll guess it
won�t be long before that happens.� Her forecast proved correct and less than a
minute later his sperm shot in the air and globs of it landed on both bodies
but was soon washed away. �If either of you tell me that you didn�t enjoy that,
I�ll accuse you of lying.� Kate grinned broadly and went on, �Now wash each
others backs and arses and the backs of Bob�s thighs. Be very gentle as I�m
sure you will. The warm water should have eased the pain and relaxed the
muscles a little. I�m going to dry myself and when you�re done and dry, go into
the bedroom to put the ointment on.�

�Kate? Is my bottom as bad as Robert�s?�
Melanie very tenderly patted his bottom with a soft towel. �It�s painful to
turn my body enough to see in the mirror properly.�

��I
know you want the truth Mel and really there is no point in me lying. The cane
marks are about the same. Those girls seem to be able to judge giving equal
punishments to both people. The strap marks underneath though, are nothing like
as bad as Bob�s and as you�ve seen, he has them all the way down his legs and
over his arms. Before long he�ll have one big bruise from neck to ankles.� This
brought home to Melanie once again just what Robert did to protect her and
tears began to form in her eyes. Kate went on, �Mel you haven�t got away
unscathed either but your bruises are more on your arse and a few scattered on
your back and of course, the ones on your tits and stomach. Bob�s got welts
there too but they�re not so severe. Now go and put some ointment on each
other.� Kate disappeared to find out what was happening elsewhere.

Twenty minutes later they were again
lying face-to-face on the bed. �What are we going to do Robert?�

�Melanie, there is something I am going
to do to you that I�ve been wanting to do for a long while. I guess now might
be my only chance, even it there are no penalty points if you try and refuse.� 

Feeling that his prick was rising again,
Melanie immediately jumped to one conclusion. �No! I�m too sore and I thought
you were too!� Instead of answering, Bob gently pulled her head to his and
kissed her, first with a quick peck and then a much longer, more passionate
one. 

Confused, bewildered and unsure how to
react, Melanie pulled away without answering and for long moments she thought
on what he�d said and done. He�d kissed her, and not just a social peck either
and then he�d said that it was something he�d wanted to do for a long while,
�Did he want to do that while we were still at work? Did he want to get into my
knickers? Make love to me? All those months ago?� Her eyes started weeping
again but she allowed Bob to pull her as close as he dared. Her mind still
raced. �Can it be that he likes me? After the way I�ve treated him? And I
always thought of him as an uncouth peasant? Yet he suffered terribly to
protect me. Was he always my equal, socially as well as at work? Perhaps in his
own way he was. Certainly he has more friends than I do. More people in the
works like him whereas they only think of me as some snooty bitch. Perhaps
that�s what I was. Should I kiss him back? No, I couldn�t do that. Or could I?
Just to give him a bit of comfort? Admit it, you liked it when he did it. Will
I let him go further? Kate made me masturbate him and I quite liked the power
it gave me even though I tried to pretend I was only doing it because she said
so. She was right when she said I enjoyed it, and what he did to me as well.�
Almost without thinking she leaned towards him and then rested her cheek on
his.

Ten minutes later, Bob started to answer
her original question. �You asked what we were going to do Mel��

�Robert? I know this might still sound
snooty, and I know everyone here calls me Mel and you Bob, but between
ourselves can we keep using our full names like we did at work? I think it will
make us special to each other if we do that. It will set us apart from them.�

�Yes, of course I can, I�ve been doing
for several years now and I won�t mind continuing provided you don�t try and
use it to belittle me�You want us to have a special relationship?�

�We have to have while we are here. What
happens later is anyone�s guess. At the moment we are assuming we will be
released as soon as we�re fit enough to move. And then what?�

�You mean do we go back to Robotics? And
Jim Wilmore who put us here? I�m still undecided. One side of me says tell him
to stuff his job after all that he�s put us through. I�m sure we could both
find other work and then I thought, well, I like the job. Its interesting and
challenging, not just humdrum maintenance stuff, and I doubt whether Jim
expected us to be treated like this so before deciding, I�m going to wait until
this is over and see what he says. Maybe he�ll have the decency to visit, if
they�ll let him.� 

They discussed it for a while and then
both had to move as the position they were in caused some muscles to cramp or
become sore but the movement also brought more pain even though the pills had
eased it considerably. Hardly had they found a temporarily easier position
when, after a brief knock at the door, a man entered.

�Morning,� he started cheerfully, �I�m
Graeme, and they�ve elected me to run this place for a while. How are you? No
need to answer that, you�re obviously very sore. At the moment I can only offer
my apologies for the appalling treatment you received. I think Henry�s mind did
a flip and none of us stood up to her until too late so we�re all partly to
blame. Now we have to find ways of making amends. I must also apologise for my
being dressed but that is my new found status symbol. Please ignore it and if
it upsets you that I�m dressed while you�re not, then I can easily remove them.
Are you able to sit up or move?�

�Not without help and more pain,� Bob
answered.

�We�ll see what Kate can do. She�s a SRN
although only part time now but she�s good at her job so do take notice of
her.� Bob and Mel both nodded slightly. �I�ve no doubt you want to know what is
going to happen to you. First of all you will not be kept imprisoned in here
and you will be free to go as soon as the time you were booked in for, is
finished. Maybe earlier if you are able to get around sufficiently well. I am
sure that will be a relief for you. While you are here you will be looked after
to the best of our ability. What will actually happen may depend on a meeting
we�re having at nine. All the staff will attend and we�re going to discuss two
main points; how to deal with Henrietta and how to keep this place open and not
create a huge scandal. The clinic has had a lot of success, as I well know, and
a lot of local jobs rely on it, so as you can imagine, the staff are keen to
keep it open. After any decisions that are made at the meeting you will be
helped to attend to get your views on our decisions and see if we can come to
some agreement. Both of you are the key players that hold the future of this
place in your hands.�

Another short tap and the door and a maid
pushing a food trolley came in. �Sorry sir, Kate sent me up with breakfast.
She�ll be in herself in a moment of two.�

&nbsp;

Chapter 8. Henrietta�s �marriage� 

�Come along Henrietta my darling wife,
time for me to exercise my carnal rights with my new bride. I�m more than ready
for a nice long mating session. It�s time you had a real prick and a nice load
of spunk inside you instead of those plastic imitations that Julie and you
use.� Reluctantly she allowed Gerry to lead her to the bed and, although her
mind furiously tried to scheme a way out of the situation, for the moment she
couldn�t find one. Her own rules were being used against her. �Good grief
Henry, you�re a dry as toast. Doesn�t the sight of a man�s prick arouse you at
all?�

�Sorry. After all that�s happened and not
getting any sleep and fearing what is going to happen, has turned me off.�

�Like it did with the new couple! Don�t
forget that. You are responsible for their pain, and you are therefore
responsible for what is going to happen to you.� Gerry massaged her mound until
some moisture began to flow and then thrust his prick in and began to pump
vigorously. �Come on woman, show some response.� Henry though continued to just
lie there, allowing him to do what he wished without making any effort to
reciprocate.

�Everything okay?� Lucy called through
the doorway.

�If you consider fucking a limp, lifeless
ragdoll of a woman okay, yes,� Gerry answered sourly.

�Do you think a dozen penalty points
shared between you would warm her up?�

�It�s worth a try.�

�NO!� Henry exploded, �I�m doing what he
wants. He�s fucking me��

�Causing a disruption and disputing a
decision brings the total up to twenty. That should warm you up or do you wish
to double it again Henry? Ten apiece is still a reasonable amount.�� Wisely Henrietta held her tongue.

�Over the edge of the bed both of you.
John and Dave are here now so Sarah and I can do you both at the same time.�
Henry though struggled and earned another ten penalty points in doing so and it
took both the handlers to hold her in position. �Do you think you can hold
yourself in position Gerry?� Lucy asked and when he nodded she took up her
position along side him while Sarah positioned herself by Henry and, at a nod
from John, both started to methodically lay their straps across the exposed
arses. Lucy laid hers on smartly causing Gerry to wince but Sarah hit hard and
made her victim cry out in real pain. John and Dave gripped her tightly and
each squeezed a tit hard in order to try and control her movements. They succeeded
and soon Henry was weeping bitterly and planning her revenge.

The spanking obviously stimulated Gerry
and when he stood his prick was fully hard again. �Looks as if you are ready
for another session,� John commented, �Do you want to see if she�s aroused
too?�

�Sure, but it might help if you held her
in position. Sometimes a new wife has problems in keeping her legs apart.� The
grin on Gerry�s face, showed his enjoyment of the situation even if his arse
was tender.� John and Dave manhandled
Henry on to the bed and pulled her legs back to her ears. Her cunt, arsehole
and red-raw bum were on full display but Gerry didn�t wait. Plunging straight
in, for the second time in less than half an hour he fucked the woman he�d
lusted after for a long time. He fucked hard and for an abnormally lengthy time
until he again loosed his seed into her. Before the end though, Henry did
indeed become very wet and tentatively thrust back at him. She told herself it
was only to save herself from another thrashing but in her heart she knew that
wasn�t really the case.

For a while afterwards they lay alone
until Gerry suggested they shower and get ready for breakfast. �We don�t want
to collect penalty points for lateness do we?� he grinned.

The clock showed a few seconds before
eight as they paused, hand in hand, for a few moments outside he dining room
door. �Keep your head up Henry. Play their game and don�t show them that you�re
beaten. Everyone knows what�s happened so put a brave face on it.� He squeezed
her hand and entered the room amid applause from the others and congratulations
on their �marriage�. Most gazed on Henrietta�s attractive if rather slender
body for the first time and certainly no one had ever seen strap marks across
her arse. Inwardly many rejoiced that she�d had a taste of her own medicine for
once but they also sensed that this could be the beginning of the end of the
clinic. So much depended on the two who had so violently disputed her
authority.

Mentally she fumed as she eased herself
gently into a chair. �He�s right of course. I�ve got to show them that I can
take it as well as give it but I do wonder if they will accept me as boss again
afterwards,� she mused. Luckily they were at a table on their own because she
was in Kate�s place and Bob and Mel should have sat opposite them. It didn�t
please her that the pair who were the cause of her trouble, were having
�breakfast in bed�.

&nbsp;

Chapter 9. Difficult decisions

�Sir? Miss? I know I�ve never seen anyone
who�s been beaten as badly as you but I have seen some that have been strapped
awfully hard and they found it easiest to sit on the edge of the bed with a
pillow under them as well as the mattress. I don�t know if you might wish to
try it, but they do say it also helps if you lower yourself down on the pillow
a little at a time so your bum gradually gets to take the weight. It�ll hurt
some but you might be able to sit long enough to eat your breakfast. I�ll help
if you wish. I�m Gwen one of the waitresses.�

�That�s a good idea Gwen,� Kate entered
the room, �Sorry I got sidetracked watching my ex-husband and his new wife
going into the dining room. Look like they�ve collected and paid for a goodly
number of penalty points already. Henry�s bum looks real sore but she appears
to be taking it well. Guess she has to after all the times she piled penalty
points on others. I hope the pills are still working as I shouldn�t give you
any more until twelve.� So she babbled on while helping them to sit gently on
the pillows. Both gave a little cry when their arses took the full weight of
their bodies.

�You have to grin and bear it for a few
minutes and then it�s supposed to ease up a bit,� Gwen went on giving her
advice and later helping them with their breakfast.

To both Robert and Melanie, it seemed
somewhat embarrassing to have a properly clad waitress assisting them while
they were both still naked. It wasn�t so bad with Kate because she only wore
gauzy pants that hid nothing but Gwen seemed out of place and from another world.
However, Gwen showed no sign of embarrassment at the nudity around her; naked
guests were part of her everyday life.

Breakfast over and Gwen was packing the
trolley ready to return to the kitchen when Kate remarked it was nearly time
for meeting to start but she would pop back up from time to time to see if they
were all right. �You could ask in the office for one of those pager things
Miss,� Gwen suggested. 

�Good thinking Gwen, you�ve been very
useful already this morning and it will give them chance to rest without being
disturbed but first I�m going to walk them around the room a couple of times��

�Oh no! Please, I can hardly stand,�
Melanie groaned.

�Yes, they say it helps the muscles,�
Gwen interrupted, �I know it�s not part of my job, but I�ll help walk Miss if
you like and you can help Sir.� Two circuits finally became four with a pause
at the loo before Kate allowed the pair to return to the bed.

�Try and do it on your own when you�ve
had a rest,� Kate instructed as she left.

�Another sadist!� muttered Mel but there
was no venom in her voice.

For a while they lay facing each other,
each lost in their own thoughts and mentally speculating as to what was being
said at the meeting and praying that Graeme would keep his word about their
leaving. Suddenly the uncertainty, the pain and the humiliation all became too
much for Melanie and she burst into tears. Bob pulled her as close as he dared,
even to the extent of feeling her nipples against his chest. �It�ll work out
okay Melanie dear. We�ll get through it and in a few years we�ll laugh about
it.� He kissed her on the cheek and then on the lips. Melanie was by no means
certain that she would laugh about it all but relaxed in his arms and shyly
kissed him back. As usual in their time at the clinic, Bob�s prick reacted to
her closeness and she felt it against her body. Mel�s mind vacillated between
wanting to hold it, wanting it in her and being repulsed by it. However, she
left it where it was and pondered what it would be like to have it fuck her. �Will
it be better than my vibrator? Will he be able to control it like I do? What
will it feel like to have his sperm inside me?� Although she tried not to show
it, her thoughts were making her cunnie flow with moisture.

At 10:30 when Kate walked in, they were
still embracing each other. �Sorry,� she apologised, �The meeting went on
longer than we expected and we�re now going to have a coffee break. Gwen will
bring you some and then we�re going to take you into the lounge and Graeme will
explain the plans but so much depends on you and your willingness to go along
with them as to whether this place stays open. After what Henry did to you,
many are expecting closure and repercussions and a tabloid enhanced scandal but
Graeme will explain it to you in clear terms. I guess he has a job as some sort
of negotiator because he handled the meeting extremely well.�

�Will they still be letting us go?�
Melanie asked nervously.

�Oh yes dear. One or two people brought
up keeping you here but that idea was soon discarded because everyone realised
it would only lead to even more trouble and possible imprisonment when it was
found out. You�ll only be here for the length of the time you booked for
therapy and by the end of it, you should be able to sit well enough to drive
and if not, we�ll arrange for someone to drive you home.�

Robert and Melanie sat together,
uncomfortably perched on cushions in an easy chair in the lounge and listened
to the terms Graeme proposed. It was a fairly straightforward compensation
package. A free holiday, a cruise of the Norwegian Fjords was suggested because
there would be less need to display their bodies, and monetary compensation.
�We will, of course, refund the money you paid. Or at least your firm paid, to
come here,� Graeme concluded his outline.

�Use it to pay for our boss and his wife
to come!� Melanie said bitterly. �He�s the one who put us here. At least they
may have some idea of what to expect and I think their marriage is a bit
shaky.�

Robert tried to stand to answer but got
halfway up and fell back again, jolting his muscles and causing him to yell and
Melanie to put her arm around him. �I hope you don�t mind if I sit,� he tried
to smile as he spoke but everyone could tell it was forced, �At first sight,
the proposition looks very fair, but my old dad always said to think twice or
three times before making such a decision and I hope that you will grant
Melanie and me time to think it over and discus it like we would any other work
project before giving you our answer. For now, let�s just say I lean towards
keeping the place going but at work we bat ideas back and forth many times and
can come up with a answer totally different to the original concept. I am going
to suggest to Melanie that we try and make a deadline of dinner tonight but much
might depend on how we feel this afternoon. Do you think that is a good idea
Melanie?�

�Yes Robert, when we�ve made snap
decisions in the past, they�ve often been wrong.�

�Thank you both. We look forward to
receiving your answers this evening. You have suffered and it won�t hurt us to
suffer in a different way before we know if this is all going to become messy
and public. Thank you again, Robert and Melanie.� Graeme paused before going
on. �We now come to the second item we discussed earlier, the punishment of Dr.
Henrietta Coburn and, to a lesser extent, Lucy and Sarah. We also felt John and
David were accessories to the punishment but then so were most of us who
witnessed the caning last night. Some of the punishments suggested for the
ladies were wildly extreme and others were far too mild to mitigate the
injuries they caused. In the end we decided to leave the decision to you,
providing no permanent injury was caused. The general opinion was all three
should feel the strap and the cane on their buttocks and the punishment to be
carried out in full view of all the staff. Would you like to determine the
number of strokes they are to receive?�

�The same as we had!� Melanie answered
immediately.

�None,� Robert said almost inaudibly.
�None,� he repeated louder.

�You must be mad. You want to throw away
the chance to see them suffer like we have��

�Melanie and everyone, I think in rather
a parody of what happens is a real court, we should hear submissions for
leniency from the three ladies in private and then Melanie and I will confer
and come to a consensus. If this meeting agrees with this, I would like to
retire to my room for half an hour to have a shower and put some more ointment
on and then perhaps John and David will bring the two strappers to us and we�ll
hear their submissions and later Dr. Henrietta�s.�

�Why do you want them to get away without
any punishment after the way they treated us?� Melanie asked when they were
once again resting.

�If we have them beaten the same as us,
they�ll think it absolves them from their debt to us and we won�t have any hold
over them or at least not such a strong hold. Anyway I�m really not into seeing
girls beaten.�

�They should feel some of the pain that
we felt.�

�Why? To give us some sense of power?�

�A token amount perhaps? Like six with
the strap and the cane?�

�Too many.�

�Four?�

So ideas were thrown back and forth in
much the same way as ideas were at work until Robert said, �Let�s have Lucy and
Sarah in. Best to get all the info before we decide.�

A short while later the two women sat on
a settee facing Bob and Mel who were perched on the edge of the bed with the
bedspread draped over their laps. Although the two strapper girls had seen
their sexual parts close-to, neither Bob nor Mel wished to have them staring at
them during the interview.

�Sarah and Lucy, I�m sorry about the
handcuffs, but at the moment, even unarmed, you could easily overpower us and
we wanted this to be a private conversation without John and Dave standing by.
I hope you can understand that.� On receiving a nod from them he went on, �How
did you get a job like this? I�m sure it wasn�t advertised on the open market.
I can�t see any regular paper printing, �Wanted two ladies willing to strap the
bare backsides of unfortunate men and women�, or something similar.� 

It was of course Lucy who answered. �We
knew Henry at college through her roommate and found that all four of us were
lesbians. Sarah at the time was my sub but I knew that, although she was quiet
and reserved, she really wasn�t all that submissive and wanted to be a top like
me. However, we got on well together and she let me spank and sometimes strap
her before we made love. Henry went on to university and we got jobs in
security and surveillance at a big shopping centre. It was there that we picked
up Sally. Sarah caught her shoplifting and, as no one else had noticed, when
Sally gave her the usual plea not to prosecute, suggested she meet us for a
bare bum spanking. She was a true submissive and more or less became our weekend
slave, or at least on the weekends when we weren�t working. We met up with
Henry again at a girls club in Harrogate and she told us that she�d got funding
for this place. Sally by that time was becoming more attracted to a male
master, so we came here.�

�You enjoy thrashing people?� Melanie
asked incredulously. 

�I suppose we do but normally we have to
restrain ourselves so when Henry gave us permission to do what we wanted with
you, I guess we overdid things. Sorry. Yes, I am really sorry. At the time, in
my mind, you were just an object to hurt. Only afterwards when I, and I guess I
speak for Sarah too, we realised what we�d done and were really and truly sorry
for our actions and we�re disgusted with ourselves for losing control like
that. I know we deserve punishment but I hope that even after the pain we
caused you, you will be merciful with us.� Sarah added a similar apology and
after a few further words, Bob dismissed them.

John and Dave then brought Henry in and,
much to our surprise, Gerry accompanied her. �We�ve handcuffed them both,� John
explained, �And if you wish we�ll take Gerry away again but he insisted on
being with his �wife�. Gerry made an eloquent plea to stay although Henry
seemed uncertain that she wanted him there. Melanie shrugged her shoulders when
Robert looked questioningly at her and so they allowed his request.

Henry gave an outline what she had
achieved at the clinic and the high success rate she claimed for restoring
shaky marriages and partnerships but always there had been some measure of
cooperation for her methods. When they Bob and Mel arrived and kicked against
everything, she saw it as an affront to her authority and was determined to
quell their mutinous ways. Attacking and holding her hostage was the last straw
and something within her snapped and she decided without giving it proper
thought, on the kill or cure treatment that was really an excuse for revenge.
Tearfully she admitted all this and even leaned on Gerry for some support. At
the end of her story she broke down and it was left to Gerry to plead for mercy
on her behalf.

�� I know her treatment of you was far
too draconian and way above the limits that could be classed as therapy, but
seeing you two sitting together, I ask myself has not it succeeded to at least
some extent? Would you have sat together like that two days ago?� he ended.

&nbsp;

Chapter 10. Judgement and sentence

Kate made them take a longer walk around
the inside of the building after they�d eaten lunch. The pills and the ointment
eased the pain but walking was still an uncomfortable experience especially for
Robert. Two other naked couples they met, spoke with them. Both were horrified
at the sight of the bruises that now decked Bob and Mel�s bodies but one
couple, Jeff and Rachel, expressed the view that Henry�s therapy had changed
their lives for the better. Their bums showed the after effects of the strap
but they considered it part of the treatment and accepted it.

Lying facing each other in bed again,
they tried to decide on the fate of the clinic and the three women but much of
the fire had gone from Melanie. An overwhelming tiredness swept through her
body. �You decide Robert. Just hold me close, protect me again and let me
sleep.� Exhaustion must have been close for both of them and when Kate looked
in an hour later, they were fast asleep with Melanie cradled close to her
partner. 

A light tap at the door woke them two
hours later. Gwen entered pushing a trolley. �Sorry Sir, Miss, would you like
tea and cream scones? I did look in earlier and you were asleep but Kate said
to wake you now so you would be able to sleep during the night. I hope you
didn�t mind, dinner�s not until 6:30.�

�That�s okay Gwen. I suppose we ought to
move ourselves a bit,� Robert smiled wanly.

�That�s what she said Sir, but she also
said that you were to walk around the building again afterwards and she�d be up
to see that you did it and then you were to go into the gym for a work-out.�

�Tell her we�ll find an excuse to award
some penalty points for that!� Melanie surprised Robert with her joking reply.

This time Kate showed them into the
gymnasium and started the pair on the walkway but she only ran it slowly.
Melanie stood behind Robert and once again couldn�t help but notice the
dreadful bruising on his back. �None of those girls should get away scot-free
after hurting him like that and yet he wants to let them off completely.
Sometimes, well often, I just don�t understand him,� Melanie thought as she
held the bars and tried to keep her feet in pace with the rubber road. 

Others were in the gym too and Robert
soon found himself with a full erection from watching the highly erotic sight
of two, not so young, women using some of the machines. They were actually
showing off to their partners who were also sporting hard-ons. Almost
unwillingly, Melanie found her attention drawn to them too. Imperceptibly Kate
speeded up the road but it was never more than a moderate walking pace.
Nevertheless it was more than fast enough for the two walkers and before long
Kate had to stop the machine.

�You did well although I guess you might
not think so,� Kate praised them, �Now what are you like at cross-country
skiing?� Neither of them had tried any sort of skiing but with a little
prodding and moaning they fitted their feet in the artificial skis and gripped
the poles. Like most of the equipment in the gym, the items were paired so
partners could work side by side. �Race him to the end of the room Mel,� Kate
encouraged. Of course the machines were bolted to the floor and only a dial
indicated distance. Although the springs were set to �easy�, moving the poles
in coordination with their feet soon had the feeling the painful pulls of their
arm and back muscles. �Keep going, just a bit further and then you can rest.�
By the time Kate called halt both were working up a sweat and they felt like
they�d done a hundred miles. �Okay into the shower room with you and then you
can rest until dinner.�

The shower room was completely open with
several heads placed in pairs near the ceiling. Almost immediately they had
started showering under one pair, the others from the gym came in, cuddling and
kissing and the men with the erections proudly on show. They weren�t on show
for long. Hardly had the water started to flow over them, than the pricks
disappeared deeply inside their woman and a vigorous fucking began. �Don�t be
shy Mel,� one of the women called out, �Make him give you a good fucking too.
It�s a great way to bond with each other.� 

�Don�t worry Melanie, I can control
myself a bit longer,� Robert whispered but she wasn�t too sure about that. His
prick was again fully hard and kept touching her body as he tried to wash her.
�What did he mean by � I can control myself for a bit longer�? How much longer?
Should I let him? Those women seem to be enjoying it and I can feel wetness
between my legs that isn�t shower water. But I don�t want to do it here,
standing up. Perhaps in bed?� Melanie tried to sort out the confusion in her
mind. A few days ago she would never have contemplated having him this close to
her let alone think about having sex with him.

Her mind was still filled with the images
of the couples in the gym and in the shower when they lay down in their bed
again and snuggled close. She pressed her mound to his crotch and could feel
his erection against her stomach. Bob wondered how much more teasing he could
take but decided not to force the pace. They lay close like that for perhaps a
quarter of an hour, neither wishing to make the first move and Melanie knowing
the ball was really in her court and yet fearing to take the lead. Eventually
she spoke quietly and uncertainly, �Robert? Robert, I know what you want to do
but I�m not sure that I�m ready yet or if your body is ready either� but
perhaps for now we could play with each other a bit like we did in the shower
yesterday� maybe later� we might�� 

�Of course dear but perhaps we could go a
half step further and explore each other a little more intimately?� Melanie
looked puzzled when Robert repositioned himself head to tail with her and
started to finger and suck her slit and clit. She of course knew what was
expected of her but only tentatively kissed the head of his prick and very
gently rubbed the shaft. This might have continued for much longer had not Kate
returned with another dose of pills and caught her at it. 

�That�s no good Mel. Put it right in and
give it a good suck. Nothing to worry about if he does shoot his load. It�s not
unpleasant and you�ll hardly notice it if you swallow. There girl, get it right
in and give him a proper thrill.� Kate enforced her words by pushing Mel�s head
so she took the prick deeply in her mouth. There was no turning back now that
Kate was watching especially as Robert was bringing her to an orgasm. Shortly a
climax of an intensity she hadn�t previously experienced, overtook her and for
a short while she stopped sucking as the spasms shook her but a few short
probes from Robert reminded her to continue until he climaxed into her.

&nbsp;

��Ladies and gentlemen,� Robert stood holding
the back of a chair for support and addressed the guests and staff assembled in
the lounge. �This morning you left Melanie and me with two questions to debate
and answer. We spoke with the three ladies concerned with causing the pain we
suffered and are still suffering. All three apologised but whether this was
because they really felt remorse or because of the fear of punishment or loss
of jobs we couldn�t determine. At the moment we are taking their apologies at
face value. We also spoke with some of the guests as to why they thought the clinic
should be kept open and all were in favour as was the one member of the
catering staff we spoke to. Still we couldn�t really decide. Would it be
possible for a similar incident to occur in the future? At the moment I haven�t
an answer to that but Graeme tells me he has been discussing safeguards with
some of you so if they are in place before we leave, then, we will try not to
disclose what happened here. This assumes of course that we don�t have an
accident and have to go into hospital or get examined for any other reason.�
There were sighs of relief and mutterings of thanks.

�Then we had the task of deciding a
suitable punishment for the three ladies. As you know from what we said this
morning, our views on this were diametrically opposed. Melanie wanted them
thrashed as severely as we were; I believed that wouldn�t serve any purpose
other than revenge. The debate on this was very short because Melanie just
said, �You decide Robert,� which left me with the onerous task of making a
decision for both of us. For most of the afternoon, even when Kate was bullying
us to take up Olympic skiing, I had this dilemma at the back of my mind. If I
said no punishment, Melanie would feel they had got away without feeling
anything of what we had to go through; if I ordered a thorough thrashing, for
the rest of my life I would feel guilty and be conscious of the fact that on my
orders the girls had been made to suffer terribly. Only as I entered this room
did I come to a decision. I suppose at this point I should put on my judges
voice.� Lucy and Sarah, I hereby sentence
you to� one stroke of the strap and one stroke of the cane. You are to punish
each other and with the same severity as you used on us. We will rely on those
present to determine if you do it hard enough or need to repeat the stroke.�
The audience burst into comments at murmurs of surprise but Graeme quietened
them down.

�Dr. Henrietta used her position here to
get the two girls to do her will and, although they did it willingly, they knew
their jobs were in jeopardy if they didn�t. She acted largely out of spite,
spite because we didn�t conform to her rules, because we fought what we
believed was wrong and then, after we�d held her hostage, she was determined to
get her revenge. It clouded her judgement and that is something that must never
happen again. She chose thrashing us as a means of getting her revenge, I am
not going to stoop as low as that but I do now feel that she ought to know what
it is like to be on the receiving end of the strap and the cane� Dr. Henrietta
Coburn, I sentence you to receive double the punishment of Lucy and Sarah and
they are to deliver it.� Again he audience erupted a buzz of comments and
Graeme ordered the two strappers to undress, Henry was already naked and
clinging to Gerry.

John held Sarah over the back of a chair
while Graeme reminded everyone that they were to judge whether or not Lucy laid
the strokes on hard enough. It also reminded Lucy that if she didn�t her friend
would get extra. The strap hit hard and Sarah cried out loudly and then almost
jerked herself from John�s grasp when the cane was laid along the same stripe.
She had to be given several minutes to recover before she was able to take the
strap and repeat her punishment on Lucy. Both girls hugged and rubbed each
other�s bums heedless of the audience and the fact that Henry was nervously
awaiting her punishment.

Eventually they brought Henry to the
chair and bent her over it. Many expected an outburst and threats from her but
she just cried quietly as she waited for the terrible kisses of the strap and
the cane. She wasn�t kept waiting long before the hiss and crack of the leather
brought forth a loud yell. The rest of the punishment followed swiftly and she
was allowed to fall into Gerry�s arms and he led her away to their room to
apply medication and supply comfort. Lucy and Sarah likewise retired to their
room. 

Robert was still disgusted with himself
for allowing the punishment to take place at all but was somewhat mollified
when Graeme congratulated him on his decision. �They�ll feel the stripes for a
few days but will know it could have been far, far worse.� Melanie was also
rather disgusted with herself. Now that she�d seen the punishment inflicted,
she wished she�d agreed with Robert and was glad she�d left it up to him to
decide although she knew now, she�d inflicted a heavy burden on him. She knew
she would have to make it up to him and realised there was only one way she
could do it.

&nbsp;

�Robert?� Will you� will you make me your
wife while we�re here? With full marital rights like Gerry and Henry?

�You�re sure?�

�Yes� yes, dear� I suppose we�ll also
have to agree now that Henry�s treatment does work� but I still want James and
Nancy to experience it too.�
