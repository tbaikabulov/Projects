The
prologue

&nbsp;

The
reverend ended his funeral speech and invited all participants for a coffee in
the parish room.� Jim Crowley kissed his
wife gently. �Sorry Jane, I want to stay here alone with HER�. Jane nodded but
she was worried. Her husband, an early retired Marines corps officer, who went
through the first Gulf war, Afghanistan and many
dangerous special missions was an unbeatable
character, but now during the last days he didn�t stop crying. Emily their
daughter was number 8 in the list of a serial killer. 

&nbsp;

Everybody
went to the parish and Jim stayed alone at the cemetery, crying. The FBI did
not even allow the families to see their children. �I cannot allow it. I
understand your feelings but I can tell you that it is not nice to see, even
when you have seen war horrors, don�t forget this is your daughter.� had said
the officer. In the press they have learned more. Each victim had a cross
burned into their flesh on their forehead. The body was of course raped, but
worse severely mutilated, such as cut off of nipples, labia, clitoris and other
cruelties. 

&nbsp;

He took
one of the last photographs of Emily in his hands, kissed the paper and started
again crying. He did not even realise that a man was standing next to him.
�Mister Crowley?� he asked. Jim looked up. �I�m Dr Edward Hobson�� - �Please go away I
do not need a doctor� replied Jim rather unfriendly. � �I�m not here as a
doctor� he said, �but as the father of Laura, number 7
of the list. I know how you feel right away� � �Sorry..
Doctor.. Mr� � �Oh say Edward or Ed� � �Sorry Ed,
apologise, I did not want to be rude�� - �Oh I know, don�t worry, do you mind
I sit down? -� �Jim moved a little
further. 

&nbsp;

�Look, the
only thing we can do for our children and those who risk to
come next, is action� said the doctor friendly �It means you need
courage. I know you are a former Marine and I know you have courage. It is best
present you can give to Emily� Jim looked up questioned �What do you mean?� �� Ed replied� �I will not bother you now, I have a plan,
but now your wife Jane needs you over there. This is my phone and address. When
you feel ready the next days, please call me�
and we will talk together� you,
Jane, my wife Karen, my brother John and myself�� Jim took the business card. They stood up he
grabbed Ed�s hand shake it with emotion: �Thank you. You are right, this is
war�

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
plans

&nbsp;

They were
together at the home of Dr Hobson. He presented first Charles Hobson his
brother. � Charles is a former FBI man who started
several years ago a private detective office. Laura was nearly a daughter to
him. He has 2 sons and Laura was the only girl in the family. He still has
connections within the FBI and since the death of Laura he spend
all his time for private research. Tell me were you stand Charles� . 

Charles
looked around, �Yes Laura was my niece, a lovely girl. I can feel Mr and Mrs
Crowley how you feel today. To be to the point, I studied the 8 crimes to find
similar points and call it logics. I found already a lot, but with your
daughter he started already to make �hiding mistakes�. At this point I can say
that the chances are 75 pct that I could find him. Of course some luck and
coincidences need to be there. It is important as apparently he killed the
girls in phases starting with the full moon, and then with 1 or 2 weeks between
the next 2 girls probably depending his ability to
catch a victim. The next one should be between now and 2 weeks. If we do not
find him we will have to wait until the next full moon.�

�And what
when you catch him?� asked Jim. Ed answered: �You know that in this state the
death penalty is suspended due to some activists. So, he will certainly obtain
a life sentence, but in the comfort of the prisons. This is not acceptable. We
need our own justice. It is important we catch him alive. The trial is not even
required as 8 girls mean 10 too much. He has to suffer with the same or similar
as he has done to our children. It will be the revenge we can give in name of
our daughters. ���� Everybody was nodding
positively.� Ed continued: �We have here
a strong team: Charles did already a wonderful job, I�m a surgeon and obtaining
medical stuff we could need is easy. Karen, my wife is a former nurse. Jim a
combat specialist and I understood that Jane is still doing some judo or karate?�-
� In fact Judo� she answered -� �We have to prepare ourselves to have a team
which can catch the monster, ones we found him and the rest we work out during
the next days� � Jim fell in � Ed, thanks that you talked to me at the
cemetery, I believe that I have done enough missions even dangerous ones all
over the world to know that this one is an easy one. Anyway, I will get weapons
and some operational items, Jane will take your measurements to buy the
required black clothing as used by military for the missions. We will need some
communication devices. Within 2 days all will be ready.�� - �Great� said Ed. Karen added �I do the
necessary to have our alibis. A couple with victim nr 3 would like to
participate but the man walks with a cane due to an accident years ago.�� Don�t forget that we will not render the
�monster� to the authorities. Important for us is that we further talk to
NOBODY and I mean NOBODY about this mission. Is that clear for us� � Jim smiled
�I can only agree, you know that for some missions even Jane was
not knowing anything.�� Jane said :�I have a question, will we execute him once he
suffered?�� - Ed replied griming: � We planned much better, but lets go into the details now
and we come to this particular point�

They
started to discuss during the full evening preparing all the details.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Discovered

&nbsp;

4 days
later:� Charles had analysed every detail
of the FBI reports. He had still friends and ex-colleagues in the house who
gave him information and access. The monster had chosen victims between 16 and
20 years old of the different colleges and high schools of the town. It seemed
that he did return again into the same order. So following this logic the next
victim should be at the Catholic college, the same as victim 4.� That victim was kidnapped in a rather quite
avenue in a district considered as safe,� close to the college. Charles had
turned around in the whole area he believed that this street was ideal for this
purpose. There was no reason why he should change Emily has been kidnapped in
the same street as 3.� So he had parked
his car and was still writing down details of the area. 

&nbsp;

At ones he
noticed a grey closed van, parked on the other side and a guy did take a metal
cage out of it with a very young kitten. He closed the van, looked around, and
went with the cage in the direction of a 16 or 17 years old dark blond girl in
college uniform. When they crossed each other the girl of course was interested
in the little kitten. The guy started talk opened the cage and took the kitten
he gave to the girl. Then he showed his van and they both went to the van. He
opened the back door, showed something in it, he helped the girl to step in
�Jesus,� Charles said�
�she simply goes inside with a perfect stranger!�� Meanwhile the guy went in, closed the back
door. It took several minutes, the door opened again and the guy came out,
closed firmly this time with the key and� went to the drivers place. He started
the van and drove slowly away. Charles KNEW that this was his monster.� He started the car, looked in the mirror if
the van was far enough made a U turn and followed the van at some distance,
preferably with one or two cars between them. They drove quite a distance to
the other side of the town in the suburbs.�
The van went into a wood area with some residential houses and stopped
at a house where he turned into the garage, which he opened with a telecommand.
Charles parked his car as close as possible but hidden behind another car.� Went out but stayed on the side. Nothing
happened� during 10 minutes, sudden the
front door of the house opened, the guy came out looked around and walked to a
car parked in front of the house and drove away. 

&nbsp;

Charles
immediately went to the house, which was slightly isolated from the others as
there were still 2 or 3 free parcels next to it. He entered on the side, turned
around the house checked through some windows and opened with a small tool the
kitchen door. He went quickly around took some digital photos, he opened a
door, which gave access to the cellar. He was intrigued to see insulation
material on walls and ceiling, so he went down. Charles could not believe what
he saw: Chains on the wall, in the middle a genealogy chair, table and a bord� to the wall with photographs. He went
closer� �Jezus!���
The bord had 8 photographs pinned on above
each a number from 1 to 8 and beneath the name. Number 7 was Laura and 8 Emily.
The girls were photographed probably death. They were naked in the chair, a black� burned cross on
their forehead, bleeding nipples, canning strokes, bleeding vagina, open
starring eyes and faces full of horror. Charles knew that he had to keep cool.
He took some photographs and went up. He installed quickly a micro camera in a
hidden place, checked with the portable unit if it was ok, and adjusted the
angle and the lens. Went up and wanted to search the house further has he had
not seen the girl yet. However he heard slamming the door of a car. He did not
take any risk, checking everything was the same when he came in, and quickly
went out through the kitchen door. Just in time as the monster was back home. 

Through
the woody part of the parcel next door he went back to his car. With his mobile
he called Ed.� �Dr
Hobson speaking� � �Ed?� � �Yes Charles?� � �Ed
I have the monster� � �What, are you sure?��
- �Absolutely�. Then he told quickly in details
the story. �OK� said Ed,��������� 

�I will
advise the team for an urgency meeting� 

&nbsp;

Charles
switched on his hidden camera devise. The light was burning in the cellar, but
it was empty. At ones there was some movement, it was
the guy with the kidnapped girl. She was naked hand bound with a rope
struggling but without success. He bended the girl over a wooden small table
fixed in the floor, cut the rope and attached her hands to the table. The girl
tried to smash him with her free hand, but a violent smash in her face from the
guy stopped resistance and he attached the second hand. Then he attached her
feet.� Her legs were spread; as such he
could see her cunt.� The guy took off his
jeans. He did not wear anything under. His cock was standing right up, probably
exited by the whole struggle, he went behind her and put his cock into her
cunt, he apparently entered her violently and raped
the poor girl. Disgusted, he switched the system off and drove quickly to Ed�s
house. 

Meanwhile
Jim and Jane did arrive already.� Charles
told the whole story. �Look� he said �time is running quickly. We have to go
into action tonight.�� Jane interfered
�Is it quick enough to save the girl?�� -
�Yes, because all the victims have been killed the 3rd day after the were kidnapped. First he plays with them. The mutilation
did take place just before he killed them; this was a conclusion from the
autopsy reports of which I have a copy. But anyway at this moment he will rape
her, and impose her painful treatment. It is indeed the reason we have to
handle quickly as we want to avoid her too much pain. But it is better to work
when it is dark. We cannot risk a failure. He would kill the girl immediately�� 

&nbsp;

Charles
drew a small map for everybody, he showed the digital photographs on the wider
television screen, and provided several technical and operational details. Jim
advised immediately his detailed action plans. He immediately had all of the
team repeated the plans separately to check if the could remember every detail.


&nbsp;

Charles
was sent already back as he needed to monitor all out of his car. Karen did
call the �alibi couple� while Ed, Jim and Jane packed the car put their black
cloths on, except the head cover.� When
they were ready both couples took their car and drove to the couple were they
entered, leaving the cars well visible in the street. As the house was on a
corner, they went out at the backside and took another car prepared for the
purpose.

&nbsp;

During the
time that Charles was away, the guy continued with the poor girl. He took a
cane and started spanking her on her bottom until the last red stripes showed
some blood.� The girl screamed. Then he
turned her around and with a whip he slashed her well formed breasts. 

�Please
stop you are hurting me� cried the girl. -�
�Of course and there is more to follow young lady� he grinned � �Why?
Why?� she asked. -� �Because you are a
slut a whore� . He pinched one of her nipples. He had
pleasure in hurting the naked girl. 

&nbsp;

�I will tell
you what I�m going to do with you. You girls enjoy knowing!� he grinned sadly, �I will use your body, and do the same as with the
others over there� showing the photos at the wall.� The girl looked with horror� �No, you are going to kill me ��� - With his bad smile he said �This is a
favour I do to you. You will be glad. You will ask me that I strangle you, as
it will deliver you from hell!� Look this
iron cross on the poke. With the little oven I will warm it up till the cross
is red. I will mark you before you go to heaven.� � �You are a sick bastard�
she shouted. This was enough to receive a slash in her face. He opened again
his jeans dropped it down played with his penis to get it hard. He turned her
around opened her bottom cheeks and without any lube,
he entered violently in her ass. �Aaaaahhhhhhhiieiie�
she cried. 

&nbsp;

�� 

&nbsp;

4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
task force strikes

&nbsp;

They
arrived at the house. Charles started the receiver of the hidden camera. When
the image was clear they could see the girl naked and attached with wide spread
legs to chair. He had a still his T-shirt and jeans. He was flogging the girl
on her stomach.� �Bastard� said
Karen.� Ed and Jim would go to the
backdoor door and enter in the kitchen. Once inside, they would send a signal
to Karen and Jane, who would ring the bell. Charles would stay in the car and
monitor with the little spy camera and send signals to Ed�s receiver.

&nbsp;

�Good
luck� said Charles, and the four went to the house. The 2 men put on the head
cover, with a blank flexible card they opened the door entered the kitchen and
hided themselves behind the corner of the corridor
close to the cellar door. The latter was closed, probably to hide the screams
of the girl. Jim was used to such operations. He would go in action while Ed
with a pistol in his hands would back up him if something was wrong. They send
a signal to their wife�s and Charles that all was ok. Charles who monitored the
cellar gave the final go ahead. Jane rang the doorbell.� Charles could follow what happened.� The guy seemed somewhat surprised, but
immediately he gagged the girl, to avoid she would cry and he went on the
stairs. A signal was send by Charles. Everybody was ready. Jim heard the guy
opening the door, he came in the corridor. He closed the door carefully and
shouted at the front door �Who is it?���
Jane answered outside, I have here a parcel for you sir�� - � A parcel?� he
replied, staying close to the open kitchen door � I didn�t order anything�� A
that moment with to silent steps Jim was behind him, put his left arm around
the guys neck and gave with his right fist a heavy kick against his temple. The
guy did not even realise what happened and felt down on the floor. Jim jumped
on him, handcuffed him and put another at his ankles. The guy was unconscious
for a moment.� Ed ran to the front door
and opened for the wife�s, who entered. Jim being a professional in this matter
took no risk. With Ed�s pistol in hands he went quickly through the house,
checked each room, opened each cabinet, looked under
the beds to check that they were alone. When all was secured they send a signal
to Charles, who would stay outside to monitor the house. 

&nbsp;

Ed checked if the guy was still alive. He
meanwhile woke up puzzled. Jim took him with his handcuffs, they opened the
cellar door and Jim without any mercy pulled the guy down the steps of the
cellar. He threw the guy on the side and gave him a heavy trap with his foot.
The gagged girl looked with horror the 4 black masked persons coming down.� Jane and Karen went to the girl so terrorised
that you could hear screaming even with the gag in her mouth. Ed did not want
that they loosed the attachments.� He
went to the girl caressed her hair and spoke gently to her: �Hello, calm down,
you are safe now. We came here to free you. I will take first the gag out of
you mouth, so do not scream, ok?� she nodded. Ed took the gag out, the girl
breathed deeply. �What is you name girl? -��
��ci� Cindy, sir� � �Ok Cindy, please stay as
you are for a moment. I see that you have been hurt, I will examine you to check
if you are ok and then we will loose your straps, is that ok� she nodded crying
�he raped me, he hurt me, I�m in pain ..��
-� �I know Cindy we take care of
you� Ed looked at the red stripes first, but they were superficial �you have
been caned? � she nodded. With his hands he touched
her breast, palpating her left breast�� - �ouch � she said � �This one is ok,
you have no internal injuries�. Then her right breast, which was also ok. �This
is already good news for you. However in the hospital they will scan you to be
sure.�� She nodded � �
it hurts down my vagina� she whispered. Ed looked down and he saw a round piece
of wood in her vagina. He widened with his fingers her labia and saw it was a
cut of shaft, but covered with rough sand paper. �Cindy did you see this object
before he put it inside you?� She nodded
�..it was terrible� he pushed it in slowly and turned it
around it hurts�� -� �Cindy, have you
seen it?� he repeated his question� -
�Yes he showed me close by��� - Cindy, it
is important you answer this correctly: I see it is covered with sandpaper, but
are there any nails of or pins or glass or any metal hurting elements on
it?�� -�
�No, only sandpaper glued on it, but it hurts on the slightest move� -
�Good Cindy, I will take it out, I will do it as good as I can, but it will
hurt you a little, I have no choice�� she
nodded and bite on her lip.� Ed put his
left hand forming a V with 2 middle fingers on each side of the shaft, pushed
his hand down over her labia and on her clit to protect it. The he opened his
fingers to push her labia further open. With his right hand he took the shaft
firmly. With a strong quick movement he pulled the shaft from her vagina� in a second of
time.� �Aiiiii � Cindy cried. �It is over Cindy. I will now put a spray in
you vagina for disinfection and it contains also a pain killer� he ordered
Karen to give him something of the hand case she had carried with her. It was
an aerosol spray with a long tube that he glided gently but deep between her
labia inside her vagina. He activated the spray inside her. �First it is cold,
but when you feel it gets warm, the pain killer starts working� she nodded and
let Ed do his work. After some time� �it is getting warm now. It hurts
less� � �Good� said Ed; slowly he pulled the aerosol pipe outside, liquid came
out of her vagina. Then he opened her labia again and put some spray on the
outside and on her clit. 

&nbsp;

Meanwhile at one the guy on the ground
seemed to wake up: �What is going on here� he shouted� �You don�t have the right to be here.�
Jim responded with a hard smack in his stomach. �You will keep you fucking
mouth shut, is that understood!�� Hearing
the voice of her aggressor Cindy was terrorised again and started crying. � Calm down Cindy, we have him under control � She calmed down
�Who are you?� she asked � �Never mind Cindy, we are a secret task force. But I
apologise that I cannot reveal more details�� -��
�Are you CIA?� . Ed did not answer and changed subject
: �Cindy I will now give you an injection. It will distress you, there
is also some pain killer in it, you will feel relaxed but stay awake.�� Karen gave him the product and the injection
needle.� Ed gave her the injection in her
arm. 

�So, now we will release you. Do not
stand up before we say it, ok?� she nodded. They took
the straps from her wrists first. Ed took her wrists in his hands to gave a short massage to have the blood circulation working.
Then her ankles and he helped her out the chair. He turned her around and
looked at her back and bottom. Her bottom was plenty of dark red stripes who
have been bleeding before.� �Jesus� Ed
exclaimed � he did a rough job with you. Wait I will
put some unguent.�� He took an unguent
out of the case, opened it put some on his fingers and put it on her bottom
cheeks. She moaned a bit but kept quite. �� He raped me also there�� she said
with a feeling of shame. Ed opened her cheeks and inspected the outside of her
arse, put a finger half an inch inside . Only some
liquefied sperm was on his finger. �Ok� he said �you are not bleeding. Mention
it when you are at the hospital�

As she had some difficulties to stand he
looked at her feet, which were swollen. The guy had given also a spanking on
her soles, which has been painful. 

&nbsp;

�Now Cindy, I would appreciate you react.
It will help you to overcome later traumas. You hate the guy there�� she nodded angry. �Very good. I want you take your revenge. My colleague� will bring
him close by here, but hold him strongly. Do not fear,
he will not be able to do something to you. You may slam him, scratch him in
him face, hurt him badly, as long you have the force
to do it.�� -� � But will he not
get me back later???� she asked, worried.�
� �No Cindy, you will NEVER see him again. We take care of him
afterwards when you are on your way to the hospital�

Jim pulled him up, the guy tried to
protest without success. Cindy looked right into his eyes. Her eyes coloured
black from anger and hate. With her fist she gave him a smack on his nose that
started bleeding. Then she continued to slam him and to scratch him with her
fingernails, hard quickly without stopping during 3 to 4 minutes, until she was
exhausted. The guy screamed for the first time and treated her as bitch and
whore.� 

&nbsp;

�You feel well Cindy� asked Ed. For the
first time she looked around. She smiled slightly to the 4 unknown people in
black. �Thank you, Thank you � she said fell with her
arms around Ed�s neck , she went to Jim, Jane and Karen, giving them a kiss on
their masks.

&nbsp;

�We are happy Cindy we could safe you�� - She looked at the
other side of the cellar at the wall, showing us the board with photos of dead
mutilated naked girls. Each having a cross burned on their forehead. Beneath
each photo a number with a name. The last one showed only the little card with
�9 � Cindy� .�
�He said that he would burn a cross also.� With the iron warming up over there in a
small open oven� They looked all at the photos and Jim looked with horror at
photo �8 - Emily�. Fuck �n bastard he mumbled, you will pay for this. 

&nbsp;

�Come now� said Jane� �Where are you cloths?�� Jane smiled and realised that she was still
naked. She didn�t really care now that everybody had seen her body. �He
destroyed them, only my shoes are ok I think.��
They got a blanket around her body. Ed suggested that she would stay
barefoot as her feet were to swollen to put shoes. In front of the hidden
camera they waved to Charles, who started the car and crossed the road. They
helped Cindy on the stairs and brought her to the car. Charles was the only
without mask, but he had fake glasses and a fake moustache in order not to be
recognised.� Before leaving Ed gave the
package of the injection in her hands. �When you are in the hospital, give this
to the Doctor, so he will know what type of injection you received.� 

&nbsp;

Charles brought her to the municipal
hospital at the emergency gate. They came outside with a rolling stretcher.
�What is the problem� they asked to Charles. �We found her, she is seriously
hurt� Without shame Cindy opened the blanket to show her body. �Ok we know
enough� they took Cindy up out the car and put her on the stretcher. �Sir you
cannot leave the car here, please put it on the park yard over there and come
back for the statement� Charles nodded but of course he� drove away and did not return to the
hospital.��� 

&nbsp;

5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The revenge

&nbsp;

Meanwhile in the cellar they had taken
the guys cloths away and he was naked and firmly strapped to the chair.� Jim put extra cords. He could not move for an
inch. �You do not have the right to do this. I will sue you! �� Jim gave him a smack in his bleeding
face and put the gag in his mouth. Secured, they left him alone downstairs,
closed the door and locked it. Jim secured the door upstairs. He would not take
any change now! 

&nbsp;

It was already over 10pm
and for their alibi they had to be back. In the back street they entered the
house. Took of their masks and put some other clothes over their black outfit.
They confirmed their friends that the girl was free and that they had the
killer as prisoner. 

At 23 pm they went out at the front door,
talking loudly and walking at the car. It was the time that Mrs Wilkes, the
neighbour made a little tour with her dog.�
Jane deliberately started a small conversation with her about the doggy.
Then they left with their cars. They returned to the house but parked the cars
in another street close by.

&nbsp;

They returned to the cellar. It was the
hour of revenge for their tortured daughters. They put on their masks and stood
in a row in front of they guy, who really got scared.� They took the gag out of his mouth.� �Who are you? Leave me alone, you have not
the right! What did you do with the girl? She is mine! �� When he stopped screaming, Karen asked
him his name. �That�s not your fucking business� he replied. Jim made one step
forward grabbed one of his testicles and pushed it between his finger and
thumb. �Stooopp � screamed the guy. Jim increased the
pressure, the guy was screaming harder. �Bob�..Johnson� he said. Jim released
the testicle. Meanwhile Jane had searched the pockets of the guy jeans and
showed the Driver license with his photograph on. It mentionned
the name � Robert Cleveland�� She showed it to Jim and Ed. Jim returned to
the guy took his other testicle and crushed it as the previous one. They guy
started screaming again.� �Next time you
don�t lie anymore� 

&nbsp;

�What are you going to do?� he asked. �We
will tell it right away� said Jane. She took a prepared text out of her pocket
and started to read.

&nbsp;

� Robert Cleveland, in name of justice
for the 8 death daughters you tortured and murdered and the torture of the ninth
girl who escaped, we condemn you to suffer the same or similar tortures as you
inflicted to these girls. For each and every girl you mistreated, you will be
burned with the cross that�
you used on them. Your body will be mutilated. We will do our utmost
to inflict you as much pain we can. We will help you to remember what you did
to them. You will have sufficient time to think about your criminal acts�

&nbsp;

Robert opened wide his eyes. He realised
now that it was finished for him. �Look, I want to speak to my lawyer�� -� �You do not need him. The sentence is already
there�� Jane
said. He got angry : �You have not the right. Delivery
me to the police! You are sick people!�

&nbsp;

Ed went to the board and took the
photographs of Laura and Emily and got out of his pocket the photographs of the
girls taken before Robert kidnapped them. He showed Robert the photographs from
before in his left hand and the photos of the mutilated boy in his right
hand.� �Look at them, did you ever
thought how they suffered? �� -� �They were only sluts and whores, I needed to
punish them� Jim grabbed again Roberts testicles, this time both and crushed
them.� Robert screamed.� 

&nbsp;

�We will start the real work now�,� Ed said. He got out
of his case a surgeon scalpel. Robert looked with horror �Nooooo!!!��� Ed took Roberts left nipple between his
fingers, pushed it softly to have it erected, then he pulled the nipple. With
the scalpel he started to cut the nipple off. He did it on purpose very slowly
and with a sawing movement. Robert was yelling!�
When he was cut off, he showed Robert his own nipple. He looked at his
wife and said: �The poor guy is bleeding hard, we have to stop the bleeding�
she nodded and took the heated iron poke with the cross on it. It was red
heated metal. She went to him, �Noo please no � he hurled. Karen pushed the burning cross on the bleeding
opening where the nipple was. The burned flesh was smelling
badly. Robert yelled and fell unconscious due to the horrible pain. The flesh
was burned and he lost no blood anymore. Ed threw some water on his face and
Robert awoke with incredible pain in his chests. �This is for Laura� Karen
said. Ed handed the scalpel over to Jim. He took the other nipple and did the
same. Cutting slowly with a saw movement. Again Robert
was screaming. Finally the nipple was cut off. Jane had taken the re-heated
poke with the cross and put it very slowly on the bleeding wound. Again Robert
was yelling, screaming in horrible pain and lost again his consciousness. Water
in his face made him again awake. �This is for Emily� said Jane. 

&nbsp;

�Ok, we will have a coffee upstairs now.
Too much at once is not interesting. He will loose his feelings. So we leave
him a moment that he can recover and feel better the pain.� Explained
Ed. 

They left Robert alone with the burning
pain in his chests. The pain could not be described.

�Please hand me over to the police� he
begged. �Please, I will never do anything anymore to a girl�� -�
�There, you are right Robert, you can be sure that you will never
torture or kill a girl anymore! Confirmed Ed.

&nbsp;

6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Revenge is getting worse

&nbsp;

They went up taking a coffee and started
to search the house. Jane found a kind of Diary, going back to the age Robert
was 18. He started the diary when he left prison in New Mexico. He has
been in jail for the rape of a minor Mexican girl. He did not kill or torture
her at that time. �You see, these sick individuals fall always back and they
even getting worse!�� Everybody nodded. 

&nbsp;

After half an hour they went back to
Robert still horrified what was happening to him. Karen went to him. He could
see her angry eyes, full of hate. It scared him. �We will do you a favour� she
said. She took his penis and started rubbing him. Robert could not avoid an
erection. She continued her hand job without a speaking word. Finally he cum. The sperm spitted out. �Was it nice? Did you
enjoy?� she asked him � �Eeuuhh, yes thank you � he said. �Great� said Jane �Remember, this was the last
orgasm you had in your life. �� At once
he came back to reality. �No, what are you going to do�.� � �Very simple�
explained Ed. �as you have apparently a problem in
behaving yourself, we will help you. We will cut of your testicles one by one
and then we will cut your penis off : castrate you
with other words�� -� �No please no, no ooohhh� he started crying
as a child� �Please delivery me to the
police, please please����� 

&nbsp;

Ed took the scalpel. �Lets first give him
a circumcision�� He
pulled the prepuce and started again slowly to cut it away. Robert screamed
again.� Ed handed the scalpel over to Jim
and explained him to proceed. He cut first the skin of the scrotum then he cut
the testicle in the middle and finally he cut the testicle away.� Roberts cry was nearly unbearable. It was the
exact punishment they planned. Then Jane did the same with the other testicle.
Robert fell again unconscious. They waited a moment and then they woke him up
with water on his face. Now it was Karen who took the scalpel and with a sawing
movement his gland got off. Robert did not believe how heavy the pain was, he
could not believe his suffering. Finally Ed cut off the remainder of the penis
and with the heated cross he burned the wound, being sure that the urethra was
burned and closed.� Robert would not be
able to urinate after this. 

&nbsp;

They left him a moment; they went to the
garage to check if the keys were on the van and if anything was left in it.
When they came back in the cellar Robert was crying, asking them to forgive
him.� They took him out of the chair and
attached him with his handcuffs to the ceiling. Each of them took a cane and
they started him beating caning him from all sides together, he was moving his
body wild, but the parents put all they hate and force in beating him. All over
his body except his head. When they finished, they
were exhausted from the effort. They looked the victim. They knew that this
would not bring back their beloved daughter, but they felt the satisfaction of
giving that monster his punishment. He had tortured at least 9 girls. 

&nbsp;

�Wait, we did forget something� said Ed
and he took the shaft covered with the sand paper he taken out of Cindy�s
vagina. Robert had so much pain� that he only looked at the engine
without giving reaction. He know what they were going
to do. He handed the shaft to Jim who opened Roberts
cheeks and brutally inserted the shaft in his anus. Again Robert cried it out. 

&nbsp;

�So Robert� said Karen �did you enjoy
what you did to our daughters. �It is nearly finished. Still 5 crosses left to
burn on your body. You have already 3. You know one cross for each of the girls
and it will be over. We will give you peace� They burned the 5 crosses. On each
bottom cheek one and one on his back and on the sole of each foot. Again he
yelled of pain. 

&nbsp;

Finally Jim took him upstairs, pulling
him over the steps and the floor and threw him in the van.� The others took all their objects away and of
course also the hidden camera. They checked all again and again. They closed
the cellar and went to the van in the garage. They did not have to worry about
fingerprints as they have been wearing gloves all the time. Ed and Jim drove
the van and Jane and Karen did take their car.

&nbsp;

7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Roberts peace

&nbsp;

They drove approx 20 miles outside the
town and went to a private owned hunting ground in the woods. In principle
nobody was allowed there of course. The days before they had prepared a 5 ft
deep pit, a wooden case was in it. They had for security covered everything
with autumn leafs although nobody was coming there.� They took the case out and opened it. They
got Robert out. �You are going to kill me?��
he asked with some relief, hoping that death
would stop the pain.��� �No� Jane said,
�We will NOT kill you. We will put you inside, we will even put an oxygen
container as the divers use, close the case and put it inside and cover it with
earth.�� -� �No, please kill me or torture me further� � no, no
please� I�m claustrophobe, I cannot stand
to be in that��� -� �That is excellent news you tell us Robert�
said Ed. He explained to the other, that this torture is probable worse that
all what he had suffered.

&nbsp;

Robert could not escape. He was now lying
in the wooden case, well secured that he was not able to try to suicide
himself. Ed gave him a bottle water to drink. It was part of the torture as his
urethra was burned, so in a few hours he would suffer there also as he would be
unable to piss. The he took an injection needle with a product in it. �This is
called Exigine� he explained to Ed. �It will avoid
you to sleep, unfortunately it will cause some
muscular excitation and will increase your pain. So you see you will have
plenty of time to remember what you have done to all these innocent girls���� --�
his face was torn his eyes in horror � Please no, please I have quite a
bit capital that I earned when my mother died. I will give it all to you, but
please don�t burry me alive��� -- Karen
replied him that we were not at all interested in money of a serial killer.

&nbsp;

They closed the case with nails, let� it down with
the� ropes and covering it with� earth. The noise of his screams vanished as
more earth was thrown on the case. Then they put leafs over it, and you could
not even see that there has been a pit. 

&nbsp;

They left the van several miles from
there, where they left their car. Took off the number plates and Jim threw a molotoff cocktail in the van which exploded and burned..� 

� 

&nbsp;

8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The after revenge

&nbsp;

To obtain details, the FBI of course
questioned Cindy. However she did not knew where Robert had hidden her. She did
not know who was the Task force (she told the FBI that she
tough it was the CIA, but of course after checking they were unaware of this).
The press made full articles asking for witness or people who knew something.
Not the slightest result. John Bradling FBI officer, suspected that is was
revenge from somebody, but all parents from previous victims had a solid alibi.


&nbsp;

Only 2 months later when the owner of the
house did not get the rent, he entered his house and found the horrors in the
cellar. FBI went there with Cindy, who did recover completely, both physically
and mentally. She confirmed the place, but could not give any details of her
saviours. In fact as she owned her life to them, she gave less and less info
and even contradictory information to protect them. Again the affair of the
serial killer was stuck. 

&nbsp;

Six months after the facts a journalist
of the local television station received an anonymous letter with a detailed
map, indicating him that he had to go at that place and dig at least 5 feet
deep. With a colleague they went over there. The indications were accurate,
they took the leafs away, and they could see that the
ground has been opened in the past. When digging they found the wooden case.
They realised it was a grave and called the police. When they opened the case
there was the naked and tortured body of Robert. Due to the period of the year
the body was not yet in state of heavy decomposition. His driving licence was
lying on him. Quickly FBI knew who it was. Cindy confirmed she recognised the
face of her torturer on the photograph of his driver�s license. 

&nbsp;

The autopsy confirmed that the person was
alive when buried. He should have suffered terribhly
during several days, not only from the tortures, but more from the fact the
bladder was closed and that the urine infected his bladder and body. The
parents of the children reacted of course with approval. Whoever did this, was an hero, was the opinion of most of them. Only some human
rights activist protested, but due to lack of support it faded away. Not the
slightest indication that led to the authors. People were satisfied that they
knew now that the serial killer was death. He could not harm anybody
anymore.� Finally the press lost
interest. 

&nbsp;

Epilogue

&nbsp;

Dr Edward Hobson received convocation of
FBI officer John Bradling. He got used to it, nearly
all parents had been there again and again. 

�You are a doctor Mr Hobson?�� Ed nodded. �Well I have here the autopsy
report of the lab and a separate note with �non-scientific� remarks that my
colleague writes to help me. It is not really part of the file, but normally we
keep it as it can help the investigation� 

Ed did not react.� 

�Doctor, you know that they found traces
of Exigine in the �victims� blood. You know what it
is����� �� �Of course� replied Ed � It is an exitant, it avoids patients to sleep� 

�My friend writes that it is not a
current product but only used by surgeons in case that patient for their safety
my not sleep under any circumstance�� - �Indeed, so what?�� - �Aren�t you a surgeon who has access to
these products?� � �Yes, but I�m not the only surgeon in the United States�� - �Indeed, but I
believe that you are the only surgeon who could have a motive to eliminate this
killer�� - �Perhaps, but I have an alibi,
confirmed by the neighbours of friends the evening that all happened��� - �Correct, but there was also a former
Marine Corps officer with you�� - �Am I
not allowed to talk to the parents of another victim?�� - �Sure you are allowed� � �What do you want
to know officer? Does the FBI now protect criminals? Don�t forget WE are
victims� � � This card has been used to open the
kitchen door� John said showing a white semi hard card. �Have a look to the
other side� he turned the card around. �Shit� thought Ed �it is my business
card. The only mistake I made� Ed did not reply but starred forward to John. 

John Bradling smiled. He knew he got
them. 

&nbsp;

He looked in the eyes of Ed, opened his
drawer took out a lighter and burned the business card in front of Ed. Then he
took the unofficial explanations and he burned the paper also. 

He collected the burned paper put it in
an envelope and handed it over to Ed. �Can you do me a favour and put it
somewhere in a wastebasket outside this office� Surprised he took the
envelope.� John closed the file. He took
a marker, draw 2 diagonal lines over the file, and
wrote between them �Investigation closed�

&nbsp;

John gave him his hand. �Thank you� he
said to Ed, still surprised. �May I know why?� asked Ed.� From his drawer he took a photo of a
beautiful girl, the same age of Laura. �This is my niece, my sisters
daughter, sorry this WAS my niece. �Vicky
was number 2. I only regret I was not with you that night��
