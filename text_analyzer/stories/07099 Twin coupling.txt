Synopsis: A 16 year old lusts after her twin brother who has been becoming more and more distant from her. She recently realized how much she missed her best friend, and how hard and masculine his body had become. It was like she was seeing him for the first time. 






Sigh. Sixteen was such a sucky age.&nbsp; Who would have thought that it would be so hard? 

I walked to the window and looked out. 

Where was Devon?&nbsp; My twin should have been back by now.&nbsp; He&#8217;s been acting funny lately and I haven&#8217;t been able to put a finger on why.&nbsp; He started hanging around with a new group of friends. Ick�Jocks.&nbsp; The idea made me shudder.&nbsp; Why the heck would Devon hang out with the same people we always make fun of?&nbsp; Something was up, and I want to find out what.

I&#8217;ve always had a very close relationship to Devon.&nbsp; We usually did everything together, but until recently he&#8217;s been backing off from me, gaining distance.&nbsp; Something in my chest has been aching with the idea that he doesn&#8217;t want to be my friend anymore. Yeah, I know he&#8217;s my brother and will always be, but he&#8217;s also my best friend.&nbsp; What would I do if he chose those jocks over me?&nbsp; 

We&#8217;ve discovered everything together. How to tie our shoes, how to spell, how to make it seem like we&#8217;ve brushed our teeth even though we didn&#8217;t.&nbsp; His body has changed so much lately.&nbsp; I couldn&#8217;t stop myself from looking at him yesterday. He was walking around in jogging shorts and nothing else.&nbsp; His shoulders are broader than I remember, his abs defined and ribbed. Even his arms were looking pretty appealing.&nbsp; Damn it.&nbsp; I&#8217;m just a over hormonal teenager, I really shouldn&#8217;t be thinking that my brother is hot in any form of the term, but yesterday he was looking pretty great.

I looked away from the window and shook my head.&nbsp; I hate being a virgin.&nbsp; I hate being �innocent.�&nbsp; The term was so not who I am.&nbsp; I masturbate daily, mostly more than once, and I fantasize most of my day away.&nbsp; I am not innocent.&nbsp; So what if I have never been kissed except from my brother who has pecked me on the cheek.&nbsp; Really, I know what sexuality is.&nbsp; I&#8217;m hot and horny all the frickin&#8217; time, but I have no one to relieve the ache.&nbsp; 

Devon has changed so much on me. I don&#8217;t know quite what to do to bring him back.&nbsp; His attitude towards girls has changed too.&nbsp; He&#8217;s more arrogant, more demanding and more dominating.&nbsp; He&#8217;s becoming a jock like the rest of them, a mindless, inconsiderate prick.&nbsp;&nbsp; 

No.&nbsp; It&#8217;s not going to happen.&nbsp; When Devon gets home we&#8217;re going to have a long talk where I can make him see some sense.&nbsp; He needs to stop becoming the one thing he swore he never would, a jerk. Our dad was a jerk, and I couldn&#8217;t handle if he became one too.&nbsp; He is my other half, and I will not give up on him.&nbsp; Hell, even when I was having my first period, it was Devon who helped me out, showed me how to use tampax.&nbsp; We&#8217;ve always had a really open relationship. I could tell him anything no matter how stupid.&nbsp; Lately though, things have changed.&nbsp; He doesn&#8217;t even give me the time of day, or a second look.

With renewed intention, I hurumphed on the couch to wait for my wayward brother to get home.&nbsp; Mom and Dad were out for the week, so it was just Devon and I in the house.&nbsp;&nbsp; It was time that he learned not to ignore me.

---------


The sound of a car door closing woke me up.&nbsp; I looked at the time.&nbsp; Woh, it was 2 a.m.&nbsp; Tsk. Tsk.&nbsp; I heard the key in the front door and sat up waiting for Devon to walk in.&nbsp; I was pissed, he didn&#8217;t tell me he was going to be out so much.&nbsp;&nbsp; He knew I worried.&nbsp; Yeah yeah, I&#8217;m a sister who is protective of her brother, so sue me.

Devon opened the door and walked in.&nbsp;&nbsp; He was dressed in tight jeans and a black muscle shirt.&nbsp; He had my green eyes and blond hair.&nbsp; I had black hair, but that was pretty much our only difference. (of course other than me being a girl and him not.)&nbsp; 

�Where have you been?� I sat there in the dark living room glaring at him.&nbsp; I crossed my arms under my breasts.&nbsp; I didn&#8217;t care that all I had on was a t-shirt and panties.&nbsp; I didn&#8217;t care that I wasn&#8217;t wearing a bra and that my brother could probably see the outline of my nipples poking through the cotton fabric.&nbsp; Whatever, it&#8217;s my brother, it&#8217;s not like he would care.&nbsp; Even though I&#8217;ve been trying to sneak peeks of him naked, it&#8217;s not like he would ever do the same.

Devon froze. Sherri was sitting on the couch glaring daggers and waiting for him to tell her where he&#8217;s been.&nbsp; Shit.&nbsp; He knew that look, it was the stubborn I have a million things to yell at you&nbsp; and you&#8217;re going to listen look.&nbsp; He was so not in the mood to deal with this right now. Add to that she wasn&#8217;t wearing a bra and he could see the dusty rose of her nipples through her white t-shirt and yea, he didn&#8217;t want to have to cover up his hard-on as well.

He scowled and straightened his spine.&nbsp; �None of your business Sherri. I&#8217;ve been out, and now I&#8217;m home. End of story.� 

She shook her head. � Oh right, none of my business. I&#8217;m just your twin sister. Who the hell am I to want to know where you&#8217;ve been or what you&#8217;ve been doing?&nbsp; Or should I ask who you&#8217;ve been doing?&nbsp; What, Devon?&nbsp; Are you too good for me now, you don&#8217;t even spend time with me? It&#8217;s been weeks and you&#8217;ve been hanging with the jocks.&nbsp; What the hell is with that?&nbsp; I thought we swore that would never happen.&nbsp; Whatever.&nbsp; What&#8217;s up with you bro?&nbsp; You&#8217;ve been distant and it&#8217;s starting to get to me.�&nbsp; She looked at him with a pleading in her eyes.&nbsp; 

Aw crap.&nbsp; He knew she was hurting.&nbsp; He had no choice though, he had to back off from her. He had been fighting with his feelings for a long time now, but last month he had caught her naked in the shower and he almost came in his pants.&nbsp; It&#8217;s his sister for crying out loud, he wasn&#8217;t supposed to think she was hot, but he was having all these intense emotions that he didn&#8217;t know how to deal with.&nbsp; He stood there frozen for minutes, watching the water pour over her bare body.&nbsp; It was like he was seeing her for the first time.&nbsp;&nbsp; His twin, his soul mate.&nbsp; Her breasts were full and had bounced when she soaped her hair,&nbsp; Her hips and her body was tall and lean.&nbsp; With her black hair plastered to her wet body, molding to its curves, he couldn&#8217;t help but become insanely attracted to her.&nbsp;&nbsp; His sister of all things.&nbsp; He couldn&#8217;t get her out of his mind, so he hid from her.

�It&#8217;s nothing, never mind.�&nbsp; With that&nbsp; he attempted to walk past the couch and up the stairs to his room.
----



It&#8217;s nothing?! Was he crazy?&nbsp; 

I jumped up and blocked him passing the couch. Really what I succeeded in doing was pressing my breasts up against his body and wrapping my arms around his body.&nbsp; Okay, so I made it into a hug.&nbsp; He looked like he needed one.&nbsp; Maybe I needed it more.&nbsp; Who can tell about these things?

�Devon.�&nbsp; My breath caught in my throat as my nipples hardened to tight nubs and pressed against his abdomen. I wanted to rub up against him, I wanted to savor the friction and heat of his body being so close to mine.&nbsp; 

What am I thinking? It&#8217;s my brother, I couldn&#8217;t do that.&nbsp; I had to stop lusting after him, he would think I was crazy.

I could feel his heart beat speeding against my breasts.&nbsp; He stood frozen and let me wrap my arms around him.&nbsp; It felt so good, maybe he would let me hold on for a few more moments. I&#8217;ve missed him so.&nbsp; I looked into his eyes, they looked a bit scared, but of what?&nbsp; I just leaned forward and laid my head on his shoulder. 

�What&#8217;s been up with you Devon?&nbsp; Really? I&#8217;ve missed you so much lately, it&#8217;s like I don&#8217;t have a brother.&nbsp; Hell, it&#8217;s like I don&#8217;t have my best friend.�&nbsp; I squeezed my arms for emphasis.&nbsp; What it caused me to do is bring my body closer against his where something hard pressed against my stomach.

I tilted my head back curiously, pulling my body away a bit.&nbsp; He was looking nervous now, like he didn&#8217;t know what to do.&nbsp; I pressed my body into his warmth again, and again I felt a hardness against my stomach.&nbsp; I pulled away, glanced down at his jeans and sure enough, there was a healthy bulge right in front.&nbsp; In fact, his penis was straining to break through the material.

Interesting.&nbsp; Maybe I should be shocked?&nbsp; Maybe I should turn away and act disgusted like a sister should be?&nbsp;&nbsp; Or maybe I should tell him it&#8217;s okay and reassure him that it&#8217;s no big deal?&nbsp; OR maybe I should open up his jeans, take his cock and swallow it??

I looked at Devon&#8217;s face again, and yup, he was beginning to sweat.&nbsp; He was blushing with embarrassment. We&#8217;ve had all our first together, what the heck is wrong with having another one?

I slowly drew back my arms and brought my hand trailing down his left arm, over the back of his hand, and down to the front of his thigh.&nbsp; I watched as my hand trailed down his body.&nbsp;&nbsp; He swallowed convulsively and I just held my breath.&nbsp; I slowly slid my hand up from his thigh, staring him right in the eye, and moved my hand over his hard-on.&nbsp; My palm cupped him.&nbsp; Molded to his firm shape.&nbsp; I had never touched a guy like this before and my brother knew it.&nbsp; 

His breath caught and he began to shake all over.&nbsp; I decided since he wasn&#8217;t protesting yet, why not take this time to explore, so I began to slid my palm over his erection from base to tip.

Finally Devon blinked, snapped out of it, looked down and groaned.&nbsp; �What are you doing Sherri?&nbsp; You shouldn&#8217;t be touching me like this!�&nbsp; He closed his eyes like looking at me touching him was too much for him to bear.&nbsp; 

�Common Devon, let me explore.&nbsp; You know I&#8217;ve never touched another guy like this.�&nbsp; I blew my breath out.&nbsp; He was so warm, so hard.&nbsp; I wanted to touch his skin, not just his pants.

�You&#8217;re so hot Devon.&nbsp; So hard.&nbsp; Is that normal�that you&#8217;re&nbsp; so big and so long?�&nbsp; I kept my hand moving over his length.&nbsp; I was so turned on. I couldn&#8217;t help myself.&nbsp; 

I closed my thighs together trying to stop the ache building in my clit.&nbsp; It wasn&#8217;t helping, just making me want to relieve the ache even more.&nbsp; My womb clenched.&nbsp; It was feeling so empty.&nbsp; Even though it had never been filled, I felt bereft and empty.&nbsp;&nbsp; I wanted something to fill me. I wanted that something to be Devon&#8217;s cock.

�Sherri, we shouldn&#8217;t.�&nbsp; He swallowed again looking like a lost little boy.&nbsp; Maybe if I told him it was okay and that I wanted it, it might make things easier for him.

�Devon, shhh, it&#8217;s okay.�&nbsp; I wrapped my hand around him and squeezed.&nbsp; 

I watched as his eyes rolled up in the back of his head.&nbsp; He liked it I think. I squeezed again and I watched as his whole body convulsed.

Without thinking, I leaned into him, lifted my chin and pressed my lips against his. His were full and cook, mine were warm and hungry.&nbsp; I latched onto his bottom lip and sucked it in to my mouth.&nbsp; 

Devon was shocked. I could tell. He didn&#8217;t know what to do.&nbsp; Would he kiss me back or would he shove me away.&nbsp; To keep his mind from pulling away I rubbed my palm over his length again firmly, pushing his sex against his body.

With a chocked cry Devon&#8217;s lips responded.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t think he wanted them to, but they had a life of their own.&nbsp; They clung to mine, sucking, licking.&nbsp; He tilted his head so he could seal his lips against mine.&nbsp; It was the best kiss of my life.&nbsp; The only kiss.

His tongue dipped between my lips tasting my mouth.&nbsp; It explored every millimeter, and my tongue met his thrust for thrust.&nbsp; I was hungry for him.&nbsp; My womb was weeping, I could feel the wetness between my legs, and I wanted to feel his cock in me.&nbsp; My brother, my best friend.&nbsp; I wanted him, even needed him and I refused to fee ashamed about it.&nbsp; This was my soul mate, my twin.&nbsp; We were one in the same.

I bit his lip and pulled it into my mouth to suckle.&nbsp; With a groan he leaned forward following his mouth to get as close to my body as possible.&nbsp; 

Yes!&nbsp; He was responding.&nbsp; I needed him to hold me, to respond to me like responded to him.&nbsp; He ignited my blood and my body sung to his.

Slowly Devon raised his hands and grabbed my arms.&nbsp; With a desperate whimper his pulled back pulling my hand from his hardness.&nbsp; The effort looked like it cost him.&nbsp; 

�Sherri, what are we doing?�&nbsp; His eyes were wild and scared.&nbsp; How do I tell him that this is what I want.

�Devon, it&#8217;s alright.&nbsp; I want this, I need this.&nbsp; I&#8217;ve wanted you for forever.&nbsp; You&#8217;re beautiful to me.&nbsp; I want all my firsts to be with you.&nbsp; You just had my first kiss, now won&#8217;t you be my first lover? �&nbsp; I looked at him with all the hope I could muster.&nbsp; He was very hot. Tall, broad, lean, muscled and he made me laugh.

�Devon, please? I know you want it. I can feel your body calling out for mine.&nbsp; Don&#8217;t you want me?&nbsp; Don&#8217;t you think I&#8217;m worthy enough to feel your touch?&nbsp; Please Devon, I&#8217;ll do anything you tell me.&nbsp; I want to taste everything about you; I want to memorize every inch.�&nbsp; 

I reached out placed my hands on his tummy, trailing my fingers over his ridges.&nbsp; I ached so badly, I needed to get relief sometime soon or I would go crazy. I fumbled with the top snap of his jeans and grabbed the tab of his zipper.&nbsp; I slowly drew the metal down over his erection being careful not to snag anything I deemed valuable. 

Devon was breathing heavily. He didn&#8217;t seem to be able to catch his breath and I was secretly pleased.&nbsp; He wanted me.&nbsp; He hurt for me like I hurt for him.&nbsp; It was meant to be, we were meant to be.&nbsp; 
Tonight, I would be his and he would be mine.&nbsp; That was all that mattered.&nbsp; We grew up together, lived together, learned together and experienced together.&nbsp; Tonight we would love together.

I grabbed his muscle shirt and lifted it from his body.&nbsp; He raised his arms and let me slide it over his head. As soon as the material was away from him, I brought my lips down to kiss his chest.&nbsp; It was lightly sprinkled with&nbsp; hair and it tickled my lips.&nbsp; I licked and nipped at his skin, tasting his salty goodness.&nbsp; Damn he tasted sweet.&nbsp; I found his nipple erect and waiting to be suckled, and finally couldn&#8217;t hold back any longer. I wrapped my lips around it and sucked.&nbsp;&nbsp; A low groan broke from his chest.&nbsp; He instinctively leaned towards my body.&nbsp; 

I wanted to press my nipples into the warmth of his body, but I also wanted to wrap my lips around his cock.&nbsp; I pushed myself away from one nipple to dominate the second.&nbsp; Oh yes, this is what I want.

His hand came up to tangle in my hair.&nbsp; His pushed my face into his body, silently telling me he wanted me to nip harder on his sensitive flesh.&nbsp; I willingly obliged.&nbsp; 

I pulled my lips away and trailed my tongue down his tummy.&nbsp; I wanted to follow his treasure trail.&nbsp; I lead to so much sexual promise, I almost skipped all foreplay.

I made my way to the edge of his jeans and went to my knees coming face to face with a cloth covered cock.&nbsp; Hell yes, he was big!&nbsp; I wanted him in my throat choking me. I wanted him to fuck my face.&nbsp; I know I had never had it before, but I wanted it all the same.&nbsp; Tonight I would no longer be a virgin.&nbsp; Tonight I would become whole.

I lowered his jeans and boxers.&nbsp; His penis popped out from under the material standing straight and proud.&nbsp; I was even proud of it, the little soldier!&nbsp; I licked my lips.&nbsp; Glancing up at Devon&#8217;s face, I saw a mixture of worry and desire.

�Devon I&#8217;m going to taste you.�&nbsp; I made it a statement and not a&nbsp; question.&nbsp; I was going to taste him one way or the other.&nbsp; �I&#8217;m going to wrap my lips around your cock and I&#8217;m going to swallow it.&nbsp; I&#8217;m going to take you so deep, I don&#8217;t care if I choke on it.&nbsp; It&#8217;s big and beautiful, and deserves to be worshiped with my tongue.�&nbsp; He just closed his eyes and tilted his head back.&nbsp; He was in a state of disbelief and I didn&#8217;t care. 

�I love you Devon.�&nbsp; 

With those words I slowly licked a bead of pre-come from his tip.&nbsp; It tasted salty and very male.&nbsp; Yumm!

I slowly opened my mouth and slid him in.&nbsp; His penis was different than I imagined. It was hard velvet in my mouth and my tongue couldn&#8217;t stop licking the underside.&nbsp; Devon just stood there rigid and shaking.&nbsp; I knew he was loving it.&nbsp; I could tell because his cock just hardened in my mouth.

Sucking firmly, I pulled his hardness deeper into my mouth, into the back of my throat.&nbsp; I had seen in movies where a porn star would tilt her head up to fit a cock down her throat.&nbsp; I took a number from that movie and did the same.&nbsp; With a deep breath I forced myself to take all of him to the base.&nbsp; My nose touched his stomach, his testicles were a hairs breath from my bottom lip and I knew I had all 8 inches inside of me. I was thrilled�.I was turned on.&nbsp; So hot in fact that I could tell my legs were wet because I creamed myself.

I swallowed once to see what he would do, and he flinched.&nbsp; His eyes rolled into the back of his head and he groaned to tell me how much he liked it.&nbsp; Oh yes, he loved it.

Now it was time to get serious.&nbsp; I set up rhythm.&nbsp; I bobbed myself over his cock and waited for the moment he tangled his fingers in my hair to moan and let him know how good he tasted and how much I loved the feel of him controlling my head movements.&nbsp;&nbsp; I wanted more, I wanted him inside of me.&nbsp; I didn&#8217;t want to feel empty anymore. I wanted to feel close to him.&nbsp; Since he was hanging with the jocks, he&#8217;d been so distant it had scared me so deeply.&nbsp; Now I wanted to forget that feeling. I just wanted to be one with him.

I licked, nibbled, sucked, mouthed, tongued and swallowed him.&nbsp; I had to stop before he came.&nbsp; He was getting&nbsp; close, his body was strung up and vibrating.

I pulled myself off and he moaned as I moaned. The taste of him was exquisite.

His hands were suddenly everywhere.&nbsp; � Sherri, you&#8217;re wearing too much. You have got to get naked before I tear every scrap off you!�&nbsp; He pulled my shirt off and grabbed my panties with a firm tug. The material tore away from my body and suddenly I stood there in front of him naked.

His mouth found my hard nipple and he bit it without hesitation.&nbsp; I moaned and leaned into him.&nbsp; My, what wicked lips he had. I grabbed his head and held him to my body.&nbsp; I wanted him to take more of me.&nbsp; He opened his mouth wide and took as much of my full breast into his mouth as he could.&nbsp; It was amazing.&nbsp;&nbsp; 

Fuck foreplay, I wanted him inside of me!

�Devon,� I muttered urgently, �Now Devon, Please let me feel you now!�&nbsp; He lifted his head and the heat in his eyes seared me.&nbsp;&nbsp; He needed it too.

He knelt on the floor, wrapping his arms around my legs, and pulled them from underneath me.&nbsp; He caught me and laid me down on the rug.&nbsp; He forced my knees apart, but when I say forced I really mean, I opened them when he guided them open with his palms.&nbsp; I wrapped my hand around his hard length and guided him home.&nbsp; 

I put him against my bare pussy lips and stared at him in the eye.&nbsp; �Devon, I need you.� I whispered.&nbsp; 

He gave a strangled cry and he thrust his whole body forward.&nbsp; I only had a moment to catch a quick breath before he shoved his way into my body.&nbsp; My maiden head tore and I cried out from the sudden sharpness.&nbsp; It hurt, oh God how it hurt, but I wanted it, I craved it.&nbsp; I welcomed the pain and the pleasure. I hoped it would never end. 
 
Devon was mindless. He thrust into me, pulled out and thrust again.&nbsp; He gritted his teeth, held his weight off my body with his arms and hammered his cock home.&nbsp; Over and over my body welcomed his.&nbsp; I was his home, his safe haven.&nbsp; I loved it and wanted more.
 
His testicles slapped my on the ass, I arched my back to rub my nipples skin on skin.&nbsp; They wanted to feel his teeth on them.&nbsp; I wanted him to mark me as his. I would totally surrender.

I cried out and clung to him. I wanted him to never stop.&nbsp; �You feel so good.�&nbsp; I wrapped my legs around his hips and angled to take him deeper.&nbsp; He hit my cervix and it was as if pleasure was exploding in my mind. White stars flashed in my vision and I knew I was coming to know what heaven felt like.

I didn&#8217;t care if I bled onto the carpet, I didn&#8217;t care that my blood coated his cock and ran down my crease.&nbsp; I just cared that I had finally felt complete in my twin&#8217;s arms.&nbsp; I loved him; my brother, my friend, my soul. 

Tears streamed down my face with the beauty of it.&nbsp; I pulled his body close to mine and held on for the ride of my life.&nbsp; IT was wonderful and more than I ever expected.&nbsp; 

Heat built deep in my belly.&nbsp; Oh God, I was going to explode.&nbsp; He thrust relentlessly, picking up tempo and causing the rug to burn the back of my body.&nbsp; I didn&#8217;t give a fuck, I loved that I would be marked by him.&nbsp; I urged him on moaning, and crying out his name.&nbsp; I opened myself completely and bared all.

All of a sudden his body became rigid and his cry of exultation filled my mind.&nbsp; YES he was climaxing!&nbsp; My orgasm rolled over me in waves, set off by his.&nbsp; My vagina spasmed on his cock, milking every last drop from his body, as&nbsp; I quivered in his arms fitfully in his arms.&nbsp; I buried my nose in his neck and I let the tears fall.&nbsp; It was beautiful, it was fabulous.

I pulled my head back to look at him, a sated smile on my face.&nbsp; �Devon, that was��

My smile died. He stared down at me in horror.&nbsp; Disbelief and disgust written everywhere on his face�.

�No Devon, don&#8217;t be like that��&nbsp; I tried to plead with him to know that what we just did was wonderful�but he couldn&#8217;t hear me.

He pulled himself out of my body, stood up and walked out of the room.&nbsp; My blood slowly dripping down his leg from his spent manhood.

�Devon�.Wait!� I called, but all I heard was the back door opening, and slamming shut.&nbsp; 

Oh no.&nbsp; I knew right then what was happening. I knew in that instant I would never see my twin again.&nbsp; I also knew that because we didn&#8217;t use protection, I would soon find out that we had made a new life.&nbsp; It would be a girl�and I would name her Devon after her father.
