The
Mummy Lives!

Nancy Leigh
shuffled her sneakers on the sidewalk as she moved slowly down the street,
ignoring the obvious looks from the male students hurrying to a late
class.� (She also ignored the jealous
glares of the other coeds.)� The old Mansfield
 Mansion was ahead on the left. She
passed it two or three times a day, but she never paid it more than a
glance.� She never had to.� The place was only a big old spooky house.

It was the
perfect setting for a sorority haunted house fund-raiser.� For $5 and proper ID, students could pass
through the dark rooms decorated as scenes from famous horror movies.

����������� She paused a couple blocks away.� She was a little afraid of going in.� That was why she stopped. But to give herself
a reason for stopping she emptied the last of the water from the bottle.� A quick glance in all directions told her no
one was about.� She discarded the plastic
bottle by stuffing it in bushes on the corner.

����������� �Well, maybe Keith will be there,� she said aloud.� That was her wish but she knew it was a
wasted wish.� He was the captain of the
football team and a pre-law major but he also was going with Patti Peters, the
president of the sorority.� Nancy
flirted with him whenever she had the chance.�
It was her nature to flirt with cute guys to lead them on.� In this case, she knew nothing would come of
it.

����������� Still shuffling her feet, she continued her journey
forward.

����������� �Here she comes,� said Mandi Marlowe from a second story
window.� �She is still
wearing her cheerleader�s outfit.� Under her breath she added, �What a tart!�

����������� Behind her, three other sisters of Tau
Nu Alpha (TNA) sorority finished moving the props
into position.

����������� On the far left wall, they had painted images of the
interior of an Egyptian tomb.� A papermache head of the god Horus
stood on a pedestal to the far right.� 

����������� In the center was a projection TV, recently removed from
the basement of the TNA house.� The coeds
pulled a light blue, plastic tarp over it to hide it from view.

����������� For now.

����������� Inside the door, Nancy
ran into Sue and Linda, two other TNA pledges.�
The two wore bikini panties and tattered tee tops.

����������� �What are you guys supposed to be?�

����������� �We get chained up in the dungeon and menaced by a mad
scientist. What do they have you doing?�

����������� Nancy raised
her arms out toward them.� �I am the
mummy,� she said in a husky voice.

����������� All three laughed.�
The TNA haunted house was the biggest money raiser of the year.� Everyone on campus was guaranteed to
come.� Nancy
felt better.� At least they did not plan
to chain her up in a dungeon.

����������� Patti listened to the conversation from the top of the
stairs.� As soon as she heard the sounds
of the beautiful pledge�s footsteps on the stairs, she ducked into the room
across from the Egyptian themed room.�
She knew her best friend Mandi would take care of everything.

����������� Nancy was not
happy at playing a mummy.� She was
beautiful and she knew it.� In high
school she had been voted homecoming and prom queens.� As a freshman in college they had voted her
to the queen�s court at Homecoming.� That
feat was unheard of.� Surely they could
find something than the mummy for her, something that would show off her
beauty.

����������� What was worse, she had to audition for the part.� Somebody wrote out some lines.� In front of a video camera, she had to repeat
the lines over and over until they felt she made a convincing argument for
being the mummy.

����������� �Come Nancy,
we�re running late.�

����������� She maintained the same slow pace up the stairs.� At the top she turned right down the
hall.� She moved slowly into the
room.� What caught her eye first was the
large black box. 

����������� �I�m supposed to be in that?

����������� �Yeah, it�s your sarcophagus,� said Kate.

����������� Nancy
extended an arm to touch the side.� It
was simple wood with a few holes cut in the back and side.� �They must have made it out of used wood,�
she thought.

����������� �Take off your clothes,� Mandi ordered.

����������� �What!�

����������� �We don�t want our mummy showing panty lines.�

����������� Nancy
hesitated only a second.� Hell, at the
Homecoming Dance she had pulled her top down while dancing on the floor.� Stripping in front of these women would not
be that bad.
����������� Her sneakers came off
first.� A mummy would look funny wearing
only them.� Once she had the top off, she
shook her head to get her long, dark tresses back into position.� The pleated cheerleader�s skirt followed with
the red panties right behind.

����������� One hand went instinctively to her crotch, the other her
tits.

����������� �First thing.� Put your hands over your head.� Kate put that strap around her chest like we
talked.�

����������� Nancy looked
down as the coed passed a think, woven strap across her chest above her
tits.� Though she could not see it,
riveted to the strap was a heavy steel ring.�
It was near the buckle in back where she could not see it.

����������� �What�s this for?� she asked Mandi.

����������� �We�re going to secure you in the sar�sar�What
is it?�

����������� �Sarcophagus,� Kate reminded her.

����������� �We are going to secure you in the sarcophagus so you
don�t fall over.� You�re going to have
trouble keeping your balance,� she said.�
�We don�t want you to fall over and hurt yourself.�

����������� Nancy
discovered there were two nylon straps, one at chest level, another
at ankle level.� She did not see the need
for the second, but then again she did not understand much of what was going
on.� She believed Mandi when the sorority
coed told her they did it to protect her.

����������� �Put your hands down to your sides, only a little toward
your back.�

����������� Mandi stepped forward to move the brunette�s arms into
the desired position.

����������� �This will be more comfortable.�� That position would also keep Nancy
was getting leverage in trying to escape.

����������� State�s colors were white and red, and those were the
colors of the duct tape.� 

�One of you start at her ankles, the other at her waist.� Remember, we want all flesh covered.�

����������� One coed used the palm of her hand to press the end of
the tape against Nancy�s back.� She unrolled the spool of tape as she
revolved about the beautiful brunette.� Nancy
looked down as the woman passed in front of her, the tape clinging to her
flesh.

����������� �Will this stuff hurt when it comes off?�

����������� �Naw.�

����������� �Jeanna checked it out.� She said this was the way to do it.�

����������� Jenna was nicknamed �the Brain.�� In class he wore black, horn-rimmed glasses
to give herself sober, studious look.�
She was an engineering major.

����������� When the coed taping Nancy�s
upper body came to the end of the roll, she selected a new roll and started at
a new location, the brunette�s neck.� The
first passage was low, the second a little higher.� The captive coed was well aware that with
each passage, the tape came closer to her mouth.

����������� �You aren�t going to gag me with this, are you?�

����������� With fifty feet of duct tape pinning her arms to her
sides, and more than fifty pinning her legs together, it was a little too late
to start asking questions about the details.

����������� �Yeah.� We�re going to cover you whole head so no one
can see who you are.� We will leave
little slits so you can see though.�

����������� In seconds, Nancy
was beyond the point of objecting.� Mandi
used both hands to bunch her hair together over her head.� The tape continued about her head until it
reached her nose.

����������� At this point they stopped.� Nancy
expected them momentarily to resume covering her face, but they had their
attention on other parts of her anatomy.�


����������� In five minutes they were done.� They had her voluptuous body covered with
tape, Well, they had as much covered with tape as they
planned to cover.� They had covered her
front with duct tape from her nose to her feet, with the glaring omission of
covering her large tits.� They had not
covered her bottomcheeks either, but no one would see them.

����������� �Somebody call Jenna on her cell phone and ask her where
she is.�

����������� The three coeds in their room crossed their arms above
her chests as they stared at their captive.�
Nancy, for her part, could
do nothing but stare back.�

����������� �She said she�s running late.� She�s only a block away.�

����������� �Get the rest of the scene ready.�

����������� That entailed uncovering the projection TV.� With the tape acting as a posture collar, Nancy
could not turn her head to see what they did.

����������� The beautiful brunette was concerned about other
things.� The tape kept her body heat pinned
inside her.� She felt hot everywhere the
duct tape pressed against her skin.� The
upper part of her face was not hot.�
Neither were her tits nor her ass.�
She tried to catch Mandi�s eye, but the coed
stared impatiently at the door.� She
thought they were going to cover her whole body with tape.

����������� Finally Jenna arrived.�
From her shoulder bag she pulled a jewel case that she sent flying
across the room behind Nancy.� Since she did not hear it land, she guessed
someone had caught it.

����������� �You�re late!�
People will be here soon.�

����������� �Sorry.� There was
a line in the audio-visual lab.� Hang her
in the box and I�ll hook her up.�

����������� Nancy could
do nothing they two coeds lifted her from her feet.� They carried her backward a few feet in the
direction of the sarcophagus. �It took
maneuvering from� Mandi
and Jenna to do it, but they finally found a hook to hang her front.� The web strap pressed against her chest when
they let go.� She felt them do something
with her feet. Shortly afterwards, she tried to move them, but discovered they
would shift only a few inches in either direction before the pull on her calves
stopped it.

����������� Jenna disappeared behind her.� In seconds she felt unseen hands rubbing
something on her cheeks.� Something was
pressed against each.� When the pressure
went away, that object remained fastened to her bottom.

����������� About that time, Patti entered the room.� She paced back and forth before the young
captive with her balled hands on her hips.

����������� �It�s done!� called Jenna from behind her.

����������� �Do you want to explain it to her?�

����������� �Sure.�� That voice
came from behind Nancy.� Jenna appeared before her.� �What we have are three motion sensors built
into the sides of the sarcophagus in a logical �and� sequence that��

����������� She stopped abruptly when Patti interrupted.

����������� �Jenna, she�s a design major.� Speak English.�

����������� The coed turned to stick her tongue out.� She resumed her speech when she looked back
at the suspended captive.

����������� �There are motion sensors at your tits, hips and
feet.� If you don�t keep all three
moving, this happens.�

����������� She held up a remote for the captive to see.� There were numbers and red buttons on it and
one large, gray button in the center.�
Jenna smiled as she pressed it.

Zap!

����������� �Mmmmmfffffftttttt!�

����������� Nancy�s whole
body jerked when the electric current passed through her bottomcheeks.

����������� �That wasn�t� pleasant was it?� It�s set so each time it goes off, the charge
increases by one volt.

����������� �You don�t have to move all the time.� You have three seconds to move or you get
this.�

Zap!

����������� �Mmmmmfffffftttttt!�

����������� Nancy tried
to plead through the tape gag, but her words were only muffled mumblings.

����������� �Is the DVD player hooked up?� Patti asked as she resumed
her pacing.

����������� �Yeah.�

����������� �Then let her listen to what will be playing in the
background.�

����������� For several seconds she heard only silence, then Nancy heard
her own voice.

����������� �I think it would be fun to be the mummy, to have all
that tape all over your body so you can�t escape.� There you are helpless, and everyone can see
you.� The sense of being at everyone
else�s mercy is a real turn on for me.�

����������� This was the statement they had her repeat again and
again while they had the digital camcorder going.

����������� Everyone one would see her face on that screen.� They would think she enjoyed being bound
helplessly in duct tape.� They would know
who she was.

����������� �It�s only a 23-second clip, but it plays over and over
and over for two hours.�

����������� �Mandi, we have people at the door!�� The call came from downstairs.

����������� �We open exactly at six,� Mandi yelled back.� �Get the lighting ready and put the white
tape down on the floor.� We don�t want
anyone touching her and getting a shock.�

����������� As the other coeds moved away, Patti came closer, getting
in her face.

����������� �Next time, you don�t flirt with another girl�s
boyfriend.�

����������� Nancy thought
she had a chance to escape when all the sorority sisters left the room.� She wiggled back and forth, discovering two
things.� 

First, she
could not escape the tape.� The layers of
tape had her arms pinned to her back on the sides.� It had her legs pinned tightly together.

The second
thing she learned was that she could not get down from those hooks.

����������� She heard voices and footsteps.� They had started to let people in to see the
exhibits in their haunted house!� Almost
immediately, Jenna came back in the room.�
She said nothing to the captive at first as she moved around behind
her.� In seconds, she reappeared in
sight.

����������� �Once I turn this on, you have three seconds to move or
you get another jolt in the ass.� Three.� Two.� One.�

����������� Nancy started
to squirm.� That abnormal twisting and
squirming was tiring.� When Jenna turned
toward the door, she stopped squirming.�
Remembering she had only a three second reprieve, she started
again.� She stopped, she started
again.� When the coed reached the door,
the circuit closed.

����������� Zap!

����������� �Mmmmmfffffftttttt!�

����������� By then, a parade of paying customers started up the
stairs to see the mummy.� Nancy
panicked at the thought of everyone seeing her helpless while a video played
behind her as she told everyone how much she enjoyed it.

Zap!

����������� �Mmmmmfffffftttttt!�

����������� �Hey!� Look at
this!�

����������� The students, male and female, crowded into the room.

����������� Patti stood in the hallway, a satisfied grin on her face,
as they filed past.� 

Mandi tapped
her on the shoulder.

�You do
realize, don�t you, Patti,� she had Mandi say, �This will probably make her the
most popular girl on campus.�
