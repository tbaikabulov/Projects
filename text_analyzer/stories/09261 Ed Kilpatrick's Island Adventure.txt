Introduction:

Well, after a marathon story for TALES OF THE VEIL; I&#8217;ve got back into my traditional bondage series during April, May and June 2011. If you&#8217;re bored of cross dressing, bondage and being locked in a cell, then don&#8217;t read any further as this story goes back to my routes in storytelling.

Set in Eigg, a small island off the west coast of Scotland, our main character is forced to land at a remote house that comes with all the usual trappings that allow my imagination to run riot.

I Hope you enjoy


Setting the scene:

My name is Daniel Skinner. I&#8217;ve just past my 42nd birthday and celebrated it with early retirement. When I say EARLY RETIREMENT I should explain: I have worked in the software industry since leaving school with no qualifications in the mid 1980&#8217;s. I had an idea as the DOT-COM industry collapsed but took the risk and set-up my own company. This paid off three months ago when I sold my business to a US rival for a little over �10m ($15m). So here I am, single, in my early 40&#8217;s and loaded! What to do with my life?

I could buy a mansion now but what is the point? I already have a really nice four-bedroom house in the most exclusive area of Bothwell in Lanarkshire. Okay, I did splash out on a top-spec Range Rover Sport and a brand new Aerospool sport plane. Yes, one of my passions is flying and the other, we&#8217;ll get into later.

I stayed on heading up the business I&#8217;d sold for three months. The all-too-short Scottish summer was approaching and with the delivery of my new toy, I wanted to explore the beauty Scotland had to offer from the air and this meant an extended holiday. As my small software business was finally integrated into the much large UK arm of the US Company that had just parted with a significant amount of cash for, I left for an unspecified amount of time, promising to help out on an ad-hoc consultative basis when the need arose (at a large daily rate of course). As June approached I started to prepare for my adventures, which would start with island hopping on the west coast.

I should state now, that flying may be a passion but I&#8217;m new to it and therefore do not rate myself as a competent pilot; Just a guy that is leaning a new skill and yes, just a little nervous from time to time.

My first flight was set for Saturday. A small group of guys from my local club were planning to fly north to Sky for the day so I agreed to tag along:


A Beautiful Day for Flying:

My Saturday started at around 10AM at the airfield (along with my colleagues). We fuelled our aircraft, pulled them out of the hanger and carried out all the usual checks before embarking on a days&#8217; flying. We could of course stay overnight but why should we. I had around eight hours&#8217; worth of fuel on board and a comfortable bed back in Bothwell? BY eleven, we&#8217;d taken off and were cruising towards Ayrshire at a little over 2,000 feet, keeping under the corridors around Glasgow. My Aerospool was a fast little aircraft, I could easily have left the others behind but we stayed together and climbed to 4,000 feet as we left the busy skies around west central Scotland, monitoring SCOTTISH ATC at all times but none of us asked for a basic service.

The scenery was magnificent! I&#8217;d never seen Scotland this way before and loved every minute of it. A little after twelve-thirty, we all switched to Safety-Com and called out our approach into a little airstrip near Portree. 

Lunch was fantastic and by 2PM we were sitting outside having coffee and planning our route back to Lanarkshire. The others wanted to check out the Great Glen but I wanted to see the islands so we made out plans and departed separately this time. I said my good-byes to the guys and as they headed east, I climbed to 4,000 feet, going south towards Mull, my next stop.


An unexpected detour:

Maybe the early June weather was too much to hope for. As I settled into my south bound flight I could see nasty clouds approaching from the south west. I wasn&#8217;t experienced enough to work out how bad the approaching weather was but I had at least four hours fuel on board and could easily turn to the east and make a detour back towards the mainland. I carried on and reduced my height to 3,000 then 2,000 but I knew it wasn&#8217;t looking good. The approaching cloud base was far too low to continue flying south so I turned onto heading one-five-zero and ahead was the Isle of Eigg (according to my GPS). That confirmed, I looked for a break in the clouds but even the mainland was disappearing in the dark approaching mass. I turned onto a due east heading to look north again and it was getting dark also. I then called up my colleagues and just about heard their response: �Clear weather over Loch Houm.� This wasn&#8217;t looking good for me. I was far too inexperienced to continue flying so my recent training took hold and I accepted that I&#8217;d have to find a place to land.

As I approached Eigg, I checked my GPS for airfields but none showed up. I could see the town to Cleadale just ahead so I dropped to 1,000 feet and flew towards the town, hoping to find some flat ground and therefore a good place to put down. The beach at Cleadale looked perfect but I wasn&#8217;t an expert on the tide and didn&#8217;t want my brand new �70K toy swept out to sea. As I dropped to 500 feet, passing over the beach, I was about to turn around, when I saw what I thought was runway (running east to west). I again checked my GPS and nothing so I climbed to 700 feet to clear the cliffs and flew towards what I thought might just be a stroke of luck. I dropped down to take a closer look as I passed over a large house and as luck might have it, I was right, there was a runway! A lovely strip of tarmac running east-to-west with a windsock, showing a south-westerly wind so no matter what I did, this would have to be a cross wind landing.

Again my training cut in and I did a slow pass over the tarmac at fifty feet. The runway was clear of any foreign objects and as I passed to the west end of the runway, there was a large hanger with the door open. Today was my lucky day; I even had a dry palace to pull into when I finally landed. AS the runway ended, I added power again and started to climb. I could see the house much easier now. It was a large red brick, three-story building with a large single-story outhouse to the rear, with a courtyard in-between. I had to concentrate now as the rain was starting and it came on like a tap, slamming into the canopy of my little aeroplane. I turned to the south to begin my circuit at 500 feet. I again called out my intensions on the SAFETY-COM frequency and as I turned base, the sky was black and the rain pelted and the wind picked up. The cross wind landing was going to be a tough one so I eased the little plane down on the final leg towards the lovely tarmac. Nose into wind and the power set I fought the approaching wind and rain until I drop onto the runway, straightening the nose wheel just before I touched down. Thank goodness, I made it down in one piece and the elation of finally being on the ground was mainly the fact I was proud of myself and the actions I&#8217;d just taken. I was alive and now taxiing in torrential rain, thunder and lightning towards the large green hanger.

As I said previously, the hanger was laying open so I slowed down and decided to cut my engine as I entered the large space. It was as I turned right to point in the direction of the open building; I noticed the Cessna Caravan parked at the back. Still plenty of room for my wee toy so as the engine cut, I cruised into the hanger and stopped with plenty of room to spare. With the engine now shut down and the switch-off checks complete, I opened the canopy, climbed out and walked towards the open hanger. The sound of the thunder was defining and rain was now entering the hanger so I started to pull the two large doors closed, leaving just enough space for me to stand and watch the raging storm, trying to anticipate when it would end and I could get on my way again.


Meeting Ailsa for the first time:

I stood in the small opening for about thirty minutes. The clouds dissipated slightly but the rain stayed on. I had to call the airfield to let them know I was safe. Unless I arrived back in the next two hours, air-sea-rescue would be informed that I was missing and I didn&#8217;t want the already stretched service to be out looking for me. I switched on my mobile phone but as expected, there was no signal:

�You&#8217;ll get no mobile signal here,� yelled a female from some distance!

As I lifted my head from the iPhone, I saw and figure walking towards me, riffle in hand. She wasn&#8217;t pointing it directly towards me but I guess it wouldn&#8217;t take much for her to shoot me:

�Please don&#8217;t shoot miss,� I pleaded in a slightly nervous voice. �I&#8217;m just trying to get out of the storm and your runway has probably saved my life!�

As the girl with the gun approached, I could see her dark blue raincoat, with leather boots covering her lower legs. Her auburn hair cascaded around her face in the wind and trying to judge her age, I would put this girl in her mid-forties so a little older than me:

�I&#8217;ve no intention of shooting you unless I have to,� came the sweet island accent in response to my plea. �I&#8217;d no idea what I was going to find when I saw you fly over my house so this is just for my protection from the unknown!�

The girl now stood only feet away from me in the pouring rain:

�Come in here and get out of the rain,� I ushered the girl to join me in the hanger. �By the way, my name is Daniel Skinner, Dan to my friends.�

�Hi Dan,� the girl replied, entering the hanger and pulling down her hood to reveal a beautiful face. �My name is Ailsa MacDonald and I own this airfield and the house you nearly crashed into.�

I just laughed:

�I know my flying isn&#8217;t great,� I continued to try and make light of this weird situation. �I&#8217;m sorry for taking the liberty of parking in this hanger but I&#8217;ve no idea when this storm will subside so that I can be on my way.�

�That&#8217;s okay,� replied Ailsa. �I&#8217;m glad it was open for you. I doubt this storm will leave us for a few hours so why don&#8217;t you come back to the house and I can make a cup of coffee?�

My day was finally looking up again!

�That would be great,� I replied, smiling at the beauty standing right in front of me. �Do you have a landline I could use because I must let my home airfield know I&#8217;m safe or they&#8217;ll send out air-sea-rescue looking for me?�

�No problem,� replied Ailsa,� pulling up her hood again and leading me outside, turning right and heading towards the large red bricked house.



The old house had a past:

�This is enormous,� I complemented Ailsa on her house as we entered the archway leading to the inner court yard.

�Thank you,� replied Ailsa as we turned and entered the large open planned kitchen. �My husband Peter and I bought this place two years ago when we sold his business in London. I always wanted to move back to Eigg, my birthplace and set-up a B&amp;B.�

�I assume the Cesena Caravan belongs to Peter as well,� I responded? �A fantastic aircraft so I look forward to hearing all about it from him.�

Ailsa turned towards me as she took off her coat, revealing an outfit that looked really sexy to a guy of my tastes: A tight black stretchy top over a short red and black tartan mini skirt. Ailsa&#8217;a legs were clad in a pair of thick black opaque tights and her black leather boots finished her off:

�I&#8217;m afraid that will not be possible,� replied Ailsa with a tear in her eyes. �Peter sadly passed away six months ago and left me everything, including this house. Sadly I do not know how to fly so I&#8217;m stuck with the Cessna until I can find someone to buy it.�

�I&#8217;m so sorry,� I sympathetically responded.

I&#8217;d no idea what to say so I used the GOLDEN SILENCE technique to see if Ailsa wanted to divulged anymore information as she put on the kettle.

�Sadly, we were just about finished this project when he took ill and died within only a matter of weeks,� explained Ailsa. �We moved up from London because we managed to find this place and it was our dream to turn it into an alternative B&amp;B and now I simply do not know what to do with it!�

As Alisa made coffee, I called the airfield and told them that I was on Eigg and safe. I would call again when I planned to leave so until then, they were not to call out air-sea-rescue!

�So what is an alternative e BBQ,� I quizzed Ailsa as she handed me the piping hot cup?

Ailsa finally began to smile after telling me about the sad passing of her husband three months ago:

�You&#8217;ll have noticed that our runway doesn&#8217;t appear on any of your charts,� Ailsa explained.

�That&#8217;s true,� I nodded in response.

�Well that is because this house was a cold-war interrogation facility, where the government brought people they suspected of being spy&#8217;s,� Ailsa went on to tell me about the old house&#8217;s past. �Eigg is very small and people are funny here. We are also far out of the way and with little communication with the mainland, it was a perfect location to carry out government work that let&#8217;s just say, you don&#8217;t want others to find out about.�

Now this was getting very interesting and appealed to my other passion, BONDAGE.

�So this house was a prison in the 50&#8217;s and 60&#8217;s,� I asked?

�Well the outhouses across the courtyard was the old prison and interrogation centre,� Ailsa continued telling me about the house&#8217;s past over a cup of coffee in the massive kitchen. �This house is where the government officials lived in relative comfort while the dirty work went on over there.�

�So does the prison still exist Ailsa,� I was now getting a little excited?

Ailsa&#8217;a smile started to get even bigger with even a little embarrassment: 

�That&#8217;s where our idea for an alternative B&amp;B came in Dan,� responded Ailsa. �My husband had a great of interest in bondage like so many of you on the mainland and with the aircraft, he was going to be able to bring in guests to our little B&amp;B to enjoy their alternative passion in the peace and quiet of this tiny island.�

�So you were not interested in bondage yourself,� I started to play with Ailsa?

She just started to go red with embarrassment as she finished her cup of coffee:

�Would you like to see the old prison,� asked Ailsa?

�I thought you&#8217;d never ask,� I replied, joining Ailsa at the dishwasher to put away our used cups.


20th Century Torture, 21st Century Fun:

We exited the kitchen and walked back out to a torrent of rain:

�Are you sure you want to go back out in this storm,� I asked Ailsa?

�Sure Dan,� she replied. �We&#8217;re only going across the courtyard to that door over there!�

I then followed Ailsa as she led me across the internal courtyard to a heavy wooden door (not dissimilar to a stable door). As we entered the outhouse, I was confronted by a large set of bars (lying open):

�Umm, this looks interesting,� I started to get excited.

�It gets much better,� laughed Ailsa as she led me through the open barred gate to a small hall: �To the right is the kitchen and dining area. Straight ahead is our store room where a whole host of accessories are kept and if we turn left and go through this next set of bars (also open), we enter the first set of interrogation rooms.�

The short corridor had four small rooms, two either side before arriving at another set of bars (also open). Each of these four rooms had various devices of torture. One had a type of dentist chair with leather straps positioned at various strategic points to hold its&#8217; victim tight. The room opposite had a set of manacles hanging from the ceiling in the middle of the room and a set of shackles connected to the tiled floor. The third room had a gibbet style cage along one wall and a Saint Andrews cross along the other wall. The final room had a set of wooden stocks in the middle of the room to hold both arms and legs (more detail later). I was amazed at what I was seeing but Ailsa just pointed at each room as we passed the heavy iron doors, lying open so in effect each room as like a small cell in itself.

�This is amazing Ailsa,� I complemented this strange middle aged girl who now held a new level of attraction for me.

�I&#8217;m glad you like it Dan,� she replied. �If we walk through these bars and turn to our left (the next side of the courtyard outhouse) we come to the cells.�

Ailsa had now led me to another corridor with four cells either side, (eight in total). All had heavy steel doors and a sort of latch two-thirds the way up. Ailsa headed into the first cell:

�The first five cells are all like this one,� explained Ailsa.

She was referring to the single bed on the right hand side of the small cell. Toilet and wash-hand basin on the end wall where there was a high barred window. On the wall opposite the bed (left), a set of manacles hung from a ring high on the wall:

�Do the five cells have these also,� I asked, taking hold of the heavy iron cuff in my right hand?

�Yeap,� replied Ailsa. �This wasn&#8217;t a nice place to be held because according to the limited papers we&#8217;ve read, most prisoners were held in near constant bondage during their entire stay and few ever left here alive.�

�And you and Peter wanted to keep that history alive,� I laughed. �I&#8217;m sure this would have been a great hit, minus being beaten to death!�

Ailsa just started laughing, taking hold the other manacle hanging from the wall:

�Would you like to try these Dan,� she continued laughing?

�I&#8217;m not sure,� I nervously responded.

Ailsa didn&#8217;t know me and my passion for bondage. I didn&#8217;t know Ailsa and what would happen if I gave over complete control to this stranger.

�What is the worst that can happen,� she teased in response, using a key (removed from her skirt pocket) to unlock the manacle?

�That&#8217;s what I&#8217;m scared of,� I replied, taking hold of the now open cuff.

Ailsa then unlocked the second cuff and smiled at me:

�Go on, you know you want to,� she continued teasing!

How did this beauty know I wanted to try these cuffs? She had no idea about my inner most secrets but taking hold of my left hand, she lifted up and held it into the open manacle and pushed the cuff home, with an overpowering &#8216;CLICK!&#8217;

�There Dan, that wasn&#8217;t so bad after all,� Ailsa tried to calm me down, taking hold of my right arm and pushing me against the cell wall.

�Speak for yourself,� I tried to make light of the situation as I gave into my desires and allowed this stranger to pop my right hand into the second open cuff and close it, locking me to the wall.

I was now standing with my back to the left wall of the open cell with both arms held above my head in heavy iron shackles and I had allowed Ailsa, a girl I&#8217;d met less than an hour ago to place me into this vulnerable position.

�So how does it feel Dan,� asked Ailsa, stepping back and sitting on the cell bunk, which was made up with a duvet on it?

�I feel a little tied up right now,� I replied with a smile on my face. �How long are you going to keep me here?�

Ailsa then put her finger to her mouth and pretended to think for a minute, while all the time she was enjoying the tease:

�That depends on how good you are,� She continued the game! 

�Well what do I need to do to prove to you that I&#8217;m a good boy,� I played along, slightly nervous at my current predicament?

Ailsa then stood up and approached me:

�I&#8217;ll make you a deal Dan,� she started to explain. �It is clear the rain is here to stay for a while. Why don&#8217;t I leave you here for a short time, while I make us both something to eat and I&#8217;ll come back for you when its&#8217; ready?�

�I think the rain is here to stay for the day Ailsa,� I replied, trying to plead for my freedom without giving in to my desires. �I will need to head into Cleadale to find a B&amp;B for the night.�

�My house is a B&amp;B Dan so you can stay there if you want tonight,� replied Ailsa. �My rates are rather competitive but you pay depending on which accommodation you choose.�

I just laughed at what I was now hearing:

�You have it all worked out Ailsa,� I continued to laugh. �You also have me a disadvantage so I guess I&#8217;m here until you free me!�

I pulled on the chains to emphasis the bondage I was now in. Ailsa just laughed in response, leaving the cell and slamming the heavy door closed behind her. She then opened the small latch and peaked through:

�Don&#8217;t go anywhere Dan,� laughed Ailsa. �I&#8217;ll be back shortly to release you for dinner.�

With that, Ailsa closed the latch and I could hear her heading back down the corridor. There was little I could do but stand there, attached to the cell wall and await her return. 


A dinner date with a difference:

As you can imagine I was horny, very Horney! Sadly there was little I could do to gain any advantage over my raging hard-on. Both my hands were held above my head in Ailsa&#8217;s heavy manacles and I was going nowhere. I was also now locked in the prison cell with no route of escape, even if I was free from the manacles. I had no option but to await my captors return.

It was at least ninety minutes when I finally heard footsteps coming down the corridor. I was tired of standing in an uncomfortable position, with my arms held above my head. As the latch on the door opened, I could now see Ailsa looking in at me:

�I see you&#8217;re where I left you Dan,� she laughed!

�Where else would I be Ailsa,� I replied sarcastically?

Ailsa then unlocked and opened the cell door. She was still wearing her tight top, short tartan skirt and black tights. Her leather boots were now gone and replaced with low heeled pumps. She had to come close to unlock my hands and I could smell the sweet aroma of her fresh perfume:

�You smell nice,� I started to flirt.

�I&#8217;m glad you like it,� replied Ailsa, taking hold of my right hand in preparation for unlocking the cuff. �It&#8217;s called Paris!�

Ailsa was returning the flirting now as she pushed her breasts into my stomach as she reached her second hand with the key in a tight grip. I just smiled at her as her face came very close:

�Do you want me to leave you in here a little longer,� she teased, holding back from slotting the key into the locked cuff?

�Nah, I&#8217;m looking forward to our dinner,� I replied in a playful tone.�

With that, Ailsa pushed home the key, turned it and cuff popped open, freeing my right hand. As my arm fell south, Ailsa repeated the exercise on my left hand and soon as I was free.

�That&#8217;s better,� I commented. �But thanks for giving me some first-hand experience of your facility!�

�You&#8217;re still taking the piss,� Ailsa laughed, allowing me to slip pass her.

�Ah but two can play at this game,� I laughed, exiting the cell and pushing the door closed until it locked automatically.

�Come on Dan, that&#8217;s not fair,� shouted Ailsa from behind the locked cell door! 

�Remember you still have the key Ailsa,� I replied!

�Yeah but there is no lock this side of the door Dan,� Ailsa came straight back at me.

�Oh well, you&#8217;ll just have to pass the keys through the latch,� I laughed opening the tiny hatch where I was now watching Ailsa locked in her own cell.

Ailsa just smiled and held up the keys:

�You&#8217;re enjoying this Dan,� she broke the short silence.

�I&#8217;m enjoying this about as much as you enjoyed locking me in the cell,� I continued to tease and I suppose, flirt at the same time.

Ailsa then handed me the keys:

�Thank you,� I continued the game. �Now are you going to be a good girl Ailsa?�

She just laughed in response and reminded me that I&#8217;d get no dinner if I didn&#8217;t let her out. I gave in and after being told what key to use, I unlocked the cell door where Ailsa now stood right in front of me. As she exited the cell, Ailsa, rubbed her hand on my arm and led us back towards the kitchen and a wonderful spread:

�So you haven&#8217;t told me your B&amp;B rates Ailsa,� I continued our friendly exchange. �I may not be able to afford to stay in this wonderful hostelry!�

�I&#8217;m sure that a guy who can afford that little plane, can afford to stay here,� replied Ailsa as she continued eating. �It is �20 to stay in the house and �100 to stay in the cell block but you get full access to the facility on both arrival and departure day.�

�I think I&#8217;ll be staying in the house then tonight,� I responded knowing this wasn&#8217;t what Ailsa probably wanted to hear. �I will need to go back to the plane at some time because I&#8217;ve got an overnight bag in there.�

�Are you sure you don&#8217;t want to spend a night locked in one of my cells Dan,� Ailsa continued to try her luck. �I could do you a great deal!�

�What sort of deal,� I tried my luck?

�Well Peter&#8217;s plane hasn&#8217;t been flown in a while, could you take it for a quick flight tomorrow and check its&#8217; okay,� Ailsa set out her bargaining?
 
I thought for a minute. Would I be licensed to fly the Caravan? Surely yes; my pilot&#8217;s license was for a single engine aircraft, the Caravan was a single engine aircraft!

�No problem Ailsa,� I replied. �Weather permitting, you and I can take it for a spin tomorrow.�

�That&#8217;s great Dan,� responded Ailsa. �Would you like coffee now or later?�

�It depends what else is on offer,� I continued to flirt with this really cute girl.


Ailsa&#8217;s idea for desert:

It was clear Ailsa had other things on her mind:

�Why don&#8217;t you head back for the bag now and meet me in the cell block Dan,� suggested a clearly horny Ailsa.

�Is that a request or a demand,� I continued to flirt?

�Make it whatever you want,� responded Ailsa and she walked past me, heading for the back door and once again, rubbing her left hand on my arm. 

Was this a come-on I asked myself, following Ailsa out into the pouring rain? As she headed for the heavy wooden stable door, I walked out of the courtyard and back to the hanger. I pulled both doors open very slightly to allow me to enter the large space which now held two planes. I checked mine for any leaks from the heavy rain on landing (none to be found) and after picking up my hold-all, I ran back to the courtyard, trying to avoid getting soaked. As I entered the fun part of the house, I saw the store room was open. I had to take a look so I put down my overnight bag and entered the large store room. I suppose I wasn&#8217;t surprised at what I found: Ailsa and Peter had managed to accrue and myriad of equipment from straightjackets to gags, hoods and even a couple of iron masks and of course many different chains and cuffs to keep the most adventurous fetishist happy for years! I loved masks and therefore had to take a closer look at the iron mask. Just like the one in the modern movie, a side hinge opened the fearsome looking helmet. I had to see what it would be like so I held the faceplate up to my face and held it in place, ensuring I didn&#8217;t accidently close the thing and lock it! I therefore stood for a few minutes and wondered what it must have been like to be forced to wear this continuously for months on end? I pinched myself back to reality as I wanted to find Ailsa. I therefore put the iron mask back on the shelf and headed out of the storeroom, picking up my overnight bag again. Nope, Ailsa wasn&#8217;t in the first room with the dentist&#8217;s chair! Neither was she in the room with chains that hung from the ceiling but in the third room, I saw a picture I&#8217;d never forget. Ailsa stood with her arms one length in the gibbet:

�Are you quite comfy in there,� I laughed, placing my overnight bag on the floor?

�I thought that I&#8217;d present you with desert,� replied Ailsa in a wicked tone.

I now stood only feet away from a really wonderful site.

�And how are you supposed to get yourself out of there,� I quizzed my new friend?

�Well I was hoping you would let me out,� replied Ailsa. �The keys are lying over there.�

�Where Ailsa,� I really started to tease. �Can you point them out to me?�

Ailsa really began to laugh now!

�You really are enjoying yourself Dan,� Ailsa broke down into hysterics! �If I knew you better, I would say that you&#8217;re not new to bondage games!�

Shit; should I open up slightly? Why not, I&#8217;d nothing to lose!

�Well I have also been known to enjoy a little self-bondage,� I opened up. �Nothing this elaborate though!�

�I would hope not Dan, you might have been competition to me,� Ailsa&#8217;a hysterics continued! �I assume you do not have a girlfriend or a wife to share your bondage with then?� 

�You are getting personal,� I smiled. �You assumed right. I never had time for a relationship while I built up my business.�

What the fuck was I saying? Why was I telling this stranger my inner most secrets? But then, I was being presented with desert, a beautiful girl with long Auburn hair in an outfit pleasing to my eye but also locked in a cage, shaped to fit only a human.

�If you are so wrapped up in your business,� Ailsa kept probing from inside the locked gibbet; �what were you doing flying out to the islands today?�

�That&#8217;s because I sold my business three months ago,� I explained. �I have now taken the summer off to explore the western isles from the air and maybe even take a wee trip abroad for some heat, if our Scottish summer doesn&#8217;t shape up to expectation.�

�And here you find yourself in Eigg with the power to grant a girl her freedom from this cage or take advantage of her,� Ailsa really started to come onto me. �By the way, did you find anything interesting in the storeroom?�

�How did you know I looked in there Ailsa,� I quizzed?

�I left the door open, hoping you would venture in and find something that took your fancy,� she replied. �So did you find anything?�

�I found lots of fantastic toys,� I responded to Ailsa question. �I especially liked your collection of masks. I had a close look at the iron mask as I&#8217;ve always fancied trying one on. The straightjacket collection also intrigued me as again, I&#8217;ve dreamt of trying one on but never had the opportunity!�

There, I&#8217;ve gone and done it! I&#8217;ve now opened a can of worms!

�Well I can&#8217;t help you with the straightjacket right now Dan,� replied Ailsa. �The key for the iron mask is on my big bunch of keys over there. I&#8217;d love to point them out to you but as you can see, I&#8217;m a little restricted in this thing!�

�Well whose fault is that,� I laughed? �And anyway, I could be a mad rapist or something and you&#8217;ve just handed control over to a stranger!�

�Again I&#8217;ve made a few assumptions about you already Dan,� replied Ailsa. �(1) you released me from the cell earlier, you didn&#8217;t have to. (2) I think you enjoyed being manacled to the cell wall earlier and you could have easily overpowered me as I released you but you didn&#8217;t and (3) you own a plane so you must be a reasonably wealthy guy, with a passion for flying.�

�And this all makes me a good guy,� I laughed.

I then picked up the keys and headed out of the cell, past my overnight bag, still lying on the floor. I headed back to the store and picked up the iron mask again. Before trying it on for real this time, I checked the lock and after some fiddling, I managed to marry up a key that would unlock the thing. I then slipped the heavy helmet over my head and pushed the rear part hard until after a wee struggle, the lock finally engaged and the iron mask was now locked around my head. Before going back to see Ailsa, I decided to lift a heavy set of irons from the wall, where they hung alongside many other manacles, shackles, handcuffs and leg-irons. This particular set had a pair of small manacles attached to a short chain. A long chain then ran to another set of large shackles, which were also connected together by about ten inches of chain. After testing the locks, I decided to slip the larger cuffs over my ankles. Once in place, I slipped the first cuff around my left wrist, before placing the final manacle around my right wrist. I was now hobbled via a prison set from days gone-by. The cuffs and chain were very heavy and I was enjoying how they felt on me. Shuffling back to the cell where Ailsa remained locked in the gibbet; she burst out laughing when she saw me entering:

�I love the new look Dan,� she continued laughing!

�I thought you might,� I shuffled over to the girl still locked in the gibbet.

What the fuck was I going? I had locked my hands and feet into heavy irons and was now wearing an iron mask. Yes I felt as horny as hell but why had I allowed myself to do this? My only comfort was Ailsa; the girl I&#8217;d only met hours earlier had also locked herself in the gibbet. Her cage looked tight and unlike most gibbets I&#8217;d seen in museums or on TV, this one was bolted to the wall. The steel cage was shaped to accommodate a human with a frame for the head, expanding out to accommodate the body and then tapering in again to meet the contours of one&#8217;s legs. Ailsa was by no means a fat girl. She might have been a little overweight but the cage was a snug fit:

�Is that a tight fit in there Ailsa,� I questioned this cute and caged girl?

�Not really,� replied Ailsa. �I bet you&#8217;d fit in here fine. Maybe the cage door would need to be pushed closed but I&#8217;m fairly sure I&#8217;d get you in!�

�Yeah, but to do that I&#8217;d need to let you out Ailsa,� I teased. �To be quite frank, I&#8217;ve no intension of letting you out for a while so if you&#8217;re cool with it, I&#8217;m going to take your keys and have a closer look at your wee dungeon block?�

�Go for it Dan,� replied Ailsa.

�Thanks pet, I&#8217;ll be back soon,� I sarcastically responded to the authorisation to explore the outhouse.

�Who&#8217;s your pet,� laughed Ailsa!

�You are right now pet,� I laughed in reply! �You&#8217;re the one stuck in that cage!�

As I shuffled out of the cell, I lifted the keys:

�Does the big key that I used to unlock your cell earlier also work on this door Ailsa,� I asked as I left the small door?

�Yes,� replied Ailsa. �But why do you need to lock the door? I&#8217;m not going anywhere!�

�I know but it adds to the fun,� I laughed slamming closed and therefore automatically locking the cell door.

I would have opened the latch and said something sarcastic but I couldn&#8217;t! My wrists wouldn&#8217;t reach high enough in these chains. I decided to continue in the heavy irons so I struggled next door:

The integration room next to the one Ailsa was now locked in was very simple. It was basically a cell with no window (same as next door where Ailsa was). Hanging from the ceiling (centre of room) was a set of manacles. These looked to be the same as the manacles I&#8217;d spent some time in earlier today. The cuffs were hanging open but again I was far too restricted to reach up and check them out! Lying open on the floor was a set of shackles. These were the same cuffs that encircled my ankles currently so I guess Ailsa and Peter must have bought a job-lot! It was then I noticed a panel on the wall. I shuffled over to check it out. To access to button, I would have to open the plastic flat but again the fucking cuffs got in the way. It was therefore time to get rid of them if I was to give this self-tour some justice! I then reached for the bunch of keys that I&#8217;d put in my pocket. It was awkward pulling out and as expected, I dropped them onto the cold tile floor. As soon as I was on the floor, I used the correct key to unlock my right left wrist. Again this was very awkward but with some effort, I finally got there and my first wrist was free. My right wrist freedom came soon after, followed by both ankles. I was enjoying the iron mask but decided to get rid of it also so soon the iron mask and empty manacles and shackles lay in a heap on the floor. Now to check out the control panel: As expected, the button was used to pull up the chain set hanging from the ceiling. Umm, what would it be like to be pulled high, while my ankles were being kept imprisoned to the cold tile floor? That was all there was in that cell so after returning to the store room, I placed the chains and mask back where I found them and continued with my tour.

The first room had that all important dentist chain in it and nothing else! I hopped up onto the chair and felt the high quality leather of the two handcuffs, ankle cuffs and then the collar that would keep the victims head tight against the back. There were also two leather straps lying loose from the side of the chair. I could only assume that it was a sort of seat belt or lap strap but without Ailsa, there was no way to try out this devilish chair.

As I entered the final room, I marvelled at the elaborate set of wooden stocks. It was set up in such a way that the victim would have to kneel on the leather rest before putting his or her hands and neck into the stock. About three feet behind the main stock and the leather knee pad was another stock, ready to accept its&#8217; victims ankles. I carefully opened the lock on the side and raised the heavy wooden stock. There was no way to try this device without getting my head and arms stuck because of the automatic locking mechanism.

Before moving on to the eight cells, I used the latch to check on Ailsa:

�Are you quite happy in there,� I called out!

�Are you enjoying your tour Dan,� replied Ailsa?

�Yes thank you,� I responded. �See you shortly.�

It was then time to check out the cells. The first five were no different to the one I&#8217;d spent time in this morning. All with as single bed, toilet, wash hand basin and the manacles attached to the wall. All also had their beds made up with bright colourful duvets.

The sixth cell was slightly different to the previous five. On the outside of the door there was a small control panel. It was some sort of timer based system. There was three LED&#8217;s with (1) Bed, (2) Wall and (3) Door. Each LED had an UP and a DOWN arrow. I then suspected this was some sort of self-bondage cell. The door had a different key lock to the others but there were differences when I entered the cell. First of all, the same wash hand basin and toilet sat at the back of the tiny room. The bed wasn&#8217;t made up this time. It had four plastic cuffs: two for wrist either side of the pillow and two for ones ankles at the foot of the bed. Two similar cuffs were attached to the wall. It was clear someone could easily slip their hands into the cuffs and what I assumed happened next scared me and therefore I didn&#8217;t give any of these cuffs a test drive. I then exited the self-bondage cell (as I called it in my mind) and turned my attention to the final two:

Now the seventh cell I entered was different. This one had no bed, no toilet or wash hand basin. It didn&#8217;t even have a set of manacles hanging from the wall. In the middle of this cell was a large cage. The cage was black in colour with vertical columns of steel rising from the base to the top where it met similar tubes of steel. On the end nearest the door was an open gate to the cage. I had to see what this would be like so I climbed in and sat on the comfortable padding of a mattress and duvet. This would be comfortable if the victim didn&#8217;t need the toilet. I could easily lie out flat in the cage and as I didn&#8217;t want to accidently lock myself in, I ensured the gate was left open. Climbing out of the cage, I had to check out the eighth and last cell:

Now this cell was different because it was a padded cell! Ailsa and Peter had thought of everything! I had seen various straightjackets back in the storeroom and I dreamt of my desire to try this out some day. Anyway, back to the cell: It was very simple! No toilet, no wash hand basin, no bed, no cuffs! This cell was covered floor to ceiling in white padding. Even the inside of the door had white padding. There was a cut out for the latch but that was it. There was no way I could ever imagine being held in this room, tightly wrapped in a straitjacket and unable to escape. Now I was getting horny!

As I exited that last cell, I had to check out beyond the last set of open bars. As expected, this led to a large bathroom with a massive bath and shower. Nothing else to report except to comment on how fantastic this facility was! It was time to go back to Ailsa!

As I used the key to open the heavy cell door, she was exactly where I&#8217;d left her:

�You have a fantastic facility here Ailsa,� I complimented my host.

�Thank you Dan, it is nice that someone else appreciates it,� replied Ailsa from inside the gibbet. �Since Peter died it has had no use apart from the odd self-bondage session but that isn&#8217;t the same!�

�I know how you feel Ailsa,� I replied.

�Oh now I&#8217;m getting somewhere,� she laughed. �You are not new to bondage!�

For fuck sake, why was I opening up to this stranger?

�Just behave yourself Ailsa,� I teased! �Remember I have the key to your freedom.�

I then held up the key to the gibbet.

�You wouldn&#8217;t leave a girl to stew in here, would you,� Ailsa put on the puppy dog smile?

�I know you&#8217;re enjoying yourself Ailsa so why should I let you out,� I continued?

�So what did you like the best from your tour,� Ailsa started the questions again?

�I love it all,� I blurted out! �I want to try everything!�

�That can be arranged,� replied Ailsa. �You just need to let me out!�

�Do you really want out Ailsa,� I asked? 

She just stood there and said nothing:

�Okay if I let you out, can I put you in the stocks next door,� I started to bargain with my host?

�That sounds like fun,� replied Ailsa, rattling the cage door!

I then used the key to unlock the gibbet and took Ailsa by the hand, helping her out of the tight human shaped cage.

�Thank you Dan,� smiled Ailsa as she came out and headed for the interrogation room next door. 

As we entered the room, Ailsa held open the larger stocks, ready for her head and hands:

�As you have probably worked out Dan,� explained Ailsa. �This is ready for its victim and it requires no keys. Once I put myself in this, there is no way out until someone lets me out!�

Ailsa then demonstrated the feature by kneeling on the leather padding before turning around, lifting the foot stock and slid it down into place over her ankles. The CLICK ensured they were not opening without help. Next Ailsa lifted the larger stock and eased her head and hands into position. As Ailsa lowered her head, the stock followed and with another loud CLICK, I knew Ailsa was mine once again!

�How does it look,� she asked?

�I don&#8217;t know about the bondage but you look fantastic,� I complemented Ailsa on her position.

It was then I had a wicked thought!

�Don&#8217;t go away anywhere Ailsa, I&#8217;ve got an idea,� I said before disappearing out of the cell and waiting for Ailsa to respond.

I&#8217;d seen an array of gags in the storeroom and I wanted to try out my luck. I picked up a large red ball gag. The massive sponge ball would certainly fill Ailsa&#8217;s mouth and when I returned to the cell, I could hear her gasp:

�I&#8217;m not sure I&#8217;m ready for you to gag me Dan,� Ailsa pleaded!

�Are you sure,� I quizzed my new friend who was certainly in no position to complain or refuse anything. �I will never do anything you really don&#8217;t want.�

�That&#8217;s excellent to hear Dan,� replied Ailsa. �Peter and I had a safe song!�

�A safe song,� I quizzed?

�Yes,� replied Ailsa. �If I hum the national anthem then that is my safe song and you MUST free me.�

�That sounds reasonable Ailsa, would you now like to be gagged,� I laughed?

Ailsa just nodded and I popped the large red sponge ball into her mouth and buckled the strap around her head. I was careful to pull her hair out of the way and I kissed her on the forehead as I checked the buckle.

�Are you okay there Ailsa,� I checked?

She could only nod and MUMPTH into her gag.

�Right, I&#8217;ll leave you to enjoy yourself for a while,� I laughed.

Again I checked I had the bunch of keys and I locked the door on the way out. Back in the storeroom I wanted to take a closer look at a few things. The straightjackets really captivated my interest. I&#8217;d always wanted to try one but there was no way to get properly into a straightjacket without outside assistance. Ailsa certainly catered for all needs! There were several sizes in leather, Lycra and of course white canvas.&nbsp; I would need to ask Ailsa to put me into one before I left so next on my agenda was to try out a few gas masks and leather helmets. Again, I&#8217;d never worn a gas mask and it was weird to slip my head into one and listen to my own breathing, laboured under pressure. There were many leather, PVC and Spandex hoods to try but one made out of leather really took my interest. I lifted it off the polystyrene head and checked it out much closer. It had no mouth or nose openings. Instead there were a series of small perforations to facilitate breathing. There were two eyes but these had dark lenses over both. Unlike the hoods I owned, this one opened via a rear zip (much easier than laces) so I slipped it over my head, positioned the lenses over my eyes (I could see easily) and then pulled down the zip. The inside was lined and felt fantastic! I decided to keep it on do some testing on the self-bondage cell:

On my way back to the cells, I used the latch to check on Ailsa who as (as expected) held tight in the stocks. As I arrived at the self-bondage cell, I used the timer to set the door to one-minute. As it closed, there was a BLEEP and the sound of an electronic lock engaging. The timer remained on 01 and I kept an eye on my watch. As the red LED bleeped zero-zero, the sound of the door lock mechanism pulling back and the heavy steel door popping open very slightly told me that timer based system worked. I had to give this a go so I set the door timer to ten minutes this time and the wall-cuff timer to seven minutes. Both LED times flashed as before and I entered the cell. Unlike the other cell (I hadn&#8217;t noticed this before) there was a handle so I could easily pull close the heavy door. As it shut, the loud BLEEP could be heard and the locking mechanism engaging. I pushed on the door and knew I was now locked in for ten minutes! The cuffs were next. I had no idea how they worked. They didn&#8217;t open and I could easily stand with my back to the wall and slid my right wrist into the cuff. As I did this, I heard another BLEEP and the cuff automatically tightened around my wrist. This was fantastic! I then popped my second wrist into other cuff and the same thing happened. I was now strapped to the cell wall until the timer freed me. It was during this seven-minute period that I began to panic. What if this didn&#8217;t work? I would be stuck in here for ever and so would Ailsa in the stocks. How stupid could I have been? I only had seven minutes to stand there and panic because soon there were two bleeps and the cuffs opened, freeing me from the wall. I was of course still locked in the cell for another three minutes. This ended up being only one minute because the timers worked independently. I was now free to go back to check on Ailsa.

As I approached the room, I unlocked and opened the cell. Ailsa suddenly looked up from her odd position and I think smiled from behind the gag:

�Do you like,� I sarcastically asked (referring to the leather mask I still wore)?

Again all poor Ailsa could do was nod and MUMPTH into her gag. I guess it was time to release her so I eased back the clip and Ailsa was able to push up her head and release her arms. As the stock fell back down, I opened the clip on the foot stock and freed her ankles. At the same time I was freeing Ailsa&#8217;s legs, she was unbuckling the gag:

�Oh that feels much better,� Ailsa re-opened the conversation. �I see you found my favourite mask.�

�Oh I&#8217;m so sorry,� I replied, reaching round to pull open the zip. �I&#8217;ll take it off right now!�

�Don&#8217;t be silly Dan,� responded Ailsa. �It looks really good on you!�

As Ailsa did some exercises to remove any strain from her time in the stocks, I told her how brilliant the self-bondage cell was. It was then Ailsa told me how she&#8217;d spent up to a day in the place. The timers couldn&#8217;t be set for longer than twenty-four hours. There was several safety solutions built in including the system unlocking itself in the vent of a power cut and no matter what happened, the cuffs and cell door would open after twenty five hours, no matter what happed to the timer system. These were all built in as a failsafe!

�So what now,� I asked still wearing the tight leather mask?

Ailsa just stood in front on me and looked up:

�To be honest Dan I&#8217;m quite tired,� Ailsa began to set the scene for the rest of the night. �I know it is only nine but I&#8217;d like to go back to the house, have a bath and take a book to bed. I&#8217;m a single girl and I&#8217;d be much happier if you stayed here tonight!�

I just looked down and tried to grasp what Ailsa was telling me:

�You mean you would like me to sleep in a cell tonight,� I tried to understand what Ailsa was thinking?

�Yes Dan,� replied Ailsa. �If you head back to the cell you spent this afternoon manacled to the wall, I&#8217;ll bring you over a cup of coffee before locking you in for the night.�

I guess I had little option and anyway it might be fun actually spending all night locked in a cell. I agreed to Ailsa&#8217;a proposal and after picking up my overnight bag, I headed to the first cell. I suppose if I was to clean up, I needed to lose the mask so I pulled up the rear zip and tugged the tight leather from my head. After finding my toilet bag, I brushed me teeth and washed my face. Ailsa had very kindly provided towels so I guess I was going to be very comfortable tonight. I removed my socks and shoes, then my shirt and jeans before climbing into bed in my boxer shorts. It was then I heard footsteps in the corridor outside:

�Ah, I see you&#8217;ve made yourself comfortable Dan,� Ailsa smiled as she brought me a hot cup of coffee and some biscuits.

�I guess you&#8217;re right Ailsa,� I continued playing her game. �You&#8217;ve no idea who I really am and I suppose it is better that you keep me in this cell overnight, while you sleep safely in your big comfortable bed in the main house.�

�You&#8217;re so sweet Dan,� complemented Ailsa as she sat down on my bed beside me. �I think I can trust you but it is more fun this way. It is a very long time since I kept a man locked in one of these cells?�

�Did you keep Peter in here Ailsa,� I questioned?

�Yes,� replied Ailsa. �Peter spent many nights locked in a cell and so have I. You seem a really nice guy and it is clear you are enjoying playing along with me so I think you&#8217;ll enjoy it in here more than spending a night in a double bed in the main house.�

With that, Ailsa leant down to give me a hug. I held her tight and she broke down in tears. 

�I really have missed this,� Ailsa bubbled.

�It&#8217;s okay Ailsa,� I tried to comfort her. �Whatever brought us together today, I promise to be a good friend.�

Ailsa then eased back, looked into my eyes and then moved in for a kiss. I wasn&#8217;t complaining and returned what was a wonderful first experience of Ailsa.

�I&#8217;m so sorry Dan,� I shouldn&#8217;t have taken advantage of you like that,� Ailsa continued to bubble after pulling back.

�It&#8217;s okay Ailsa,� I replied. �You&#8217;re a very pretty girl and it was a really nice kiss. Maybe I shouldn&#8217;t have taken advantage of you?�

Ailsa just sat back and smiled at me before standing up:

�See you in the morning Dan, sleep well,� suggested Ailsa as she walked out of the cell.

�Good night Ailsa,� I replied. �Sweet dreams.�

It was then the heavy steel door closed with a CLUNK and I knew I was now stuck in here until the morning. 

I could hear Ailsa&#8217;s footsteps disappearing into the distance but not before I heard the next barred gate being closed and locked. This was my first experience in a real cell (except this afternoon of course) and there was little to do but try to get some sleep. Remember, it was early June and the sun really never sets this far north in Scotland. Light continued to stream through the tiny barred window that was high up on the outside wall. As I drank my coffee, the inevitable happened and due to a raging hard-on, I had to deal with some self-relief.


Sunday on Eigg:

Sunday morning in Eigg visited me several times through the long first night I spent in Ailsa&#8217;s cell. The sun barely had set, when it rose again at just after 2AM and the light streamed through the bared window of my tiny room. I managed to get back over to sleep and must have been out cold when I heard the heavy door being opened:

�Good morning Dan,� I heard Ailsa&#8217;s dulcet tones. �I assume you have slept well?

I had barely woken up when I focused on what stood in front of me:

�Good morning gorgeous,� I replied, not really thinking.

Ailsa was looking really sexy today: She wore a black dress with no sleeves. Yes, it was short and ended well above her knees. Her legs were clad today, as yesterday in black opaque tights. She wore bright red high heeled shoes and a bright re belt to match. To finish off her Sunday outfit, Ailsa wore a bright red silk or satin scarf tied tightly around her neck. I notice these things and saw the ends of the scarf falling half way down Ailsa&#8217;s back. Her long auburn hair was also in a ponytail this morning and again, her look really appealed to my kinky nature:

�Do you really like,� Ailsa fished for more complements?
�Oh yes,� I responded, trying to ease myself into a sitting position. �Black and red is very simple and on you, very effective.�

Ailsa just smiled and sat down on my bed:

�I like to make a special effort on Sunday&#8217;s,� she explained. �I don&#8217;t go to church but it is nice to dress up at least one day a week, especially if I have visitors.�

�That&#8217;s great Ailsa,� I replied. �I&#8217;d love to dress up for you also but I&#8217;m afraid I only have a change of shirt, socks and boxers for two days with me so jeans and a shirt it will have to be for me today.�

Ailsa leant over and gave me a hug:

�I&#8217;m sure I could find you something to wear today,� she cooed.

I just pushed her away and looked at her:

�Please don&#8217;t tell me you have kept your husband&#8217;s cloths and they would fit me,� I started to wonder what Ailsa was all about?

�Oh no, you don&#8217;t understand,� replied Ailsa, taking hold of my hand in hers. �Peter had another wardrobe, which he wore religiously on a Sunday and I&#8217;m in no doubt, you would fit most of the outfits.�

I&#8217;d no idea what Ailsa was going on about so I changed the subject:

�What&#8217;s the weather like,� I did my best to move to a different topic, thinking about flying?

�It&#8217;s still raining and very windy,� explained Ailsa. �I&#8217;m not sure you&#8217;ll be able to fly today.�

Ummm, this was a little weird! Did Ailsa want me to stay or did she want to keep me here?

�Oh well,� I responded. �Do you allow me to leave my cell and get a shower?�

�Of course,� replied Ailsa, trying to move back to the previous conversation. �Would you like me to fetch one of Peter&#8217;s special Sunday outfits for you to try on?�

�Oh go on,� I responded, not really knowing what I was getting myself into.

I then eased myself out of bed and grabbed hold of Ailsa, moving in for a kiss, which she accepted and reciprocated:

�Good morning,� I teased!

�Good morning to you too Dan,� smiled Ailsa at the same time standing up.

Ailsa then exited the cell, pointing at the towel and suggest I take it to the shower with me. As I exited the cell myself, Ailsa was now closing and locking the next set of bars:

�Are you scared I&#8217;ll abandon you Ailsa,� I laughed!

�Maybe when you realise what you&#8217;re going to have to wear today,� she laughed in response. �Anyway, it is more fun this way.�

As I entered the shower, Ailsa must have headed back to the house for whatever she had in mind for today. I sort of hoped Ailsa was going to persuade me into a dress. This was something I did in private back home but never with someone else. My mind started to wonder as I heard the set of bars being slammed closed again and locked. By the time Ailsa reached the shower room, I was out of the shower and shaving, with a towel wrapped tightly around my waist, hiding my modesty.

�When you&#8217;re finished Dan, put these on and meet me back in the cell,� requested Ailsa placing three items on top of the radiator.

�No problem pet,� I replied, not even raising an eye to see what she&#8217;d left me to wear.

It was only when I finished shaving and dried off, did I fully understand what Ailsa had in mind. Lying on the radiator was a black bra, a pair of Lycra pants that would attempt to pull in my male bits and a pair of thick black opaque tights. JACKPOT I thought to myself! Now this was going to be interesting so I first pulled on the extremely tight pants that not only pulled in my stomach but also my thighs. They certainly were not that sexiest but they did feel fantastic! Next I lifted the black bra. This was made of silky smooth material, with large inserts. I knew how to put on a bra so this was easy but I&#8217;d never felt the weight of artificial boobs before and they felt odd to me. Finally I was able to pull on the silky smooth Lycra tights. I loved wearing tights and I loved the way they made my legs feel as they rubbed against each other. I checked myself in the mirror, took a deep breath and headed out to find Ailsa.

As I entered the cell, Ailsa was sitting on the bunk with a smile from ear-to-ear:

�I honestly didn&#8217;t think you would put them on,� Ailsa opened a new conversation, while I stood in total embarrassment; looking at the dress she was no doubt going to persuade me into.

�Well in for a penny, in for a pound,� I responded. �I&#8217;m just not sure I&#8217;ll look as good as you!�

�Don&#8217;t be silly Dan,� replied Ailsa as she stood up, picking up the mass of satin and leather. �You&#8217;ll enjoy this bit.�

Ailsa then opened the rear of the dress using the back zip. As she handed the dress to me, I could see there were also laces on the back and while the bust was made of heavy lined leather, the skirt part of the dress (all black) was made of layers of satin, puffing out. As my arms slipped into the satin (puffed out) sleeves, Ailsa tugged at the dress before pulling up the rear zip. I took at bit of a yank but she did get there in the end:

�Shit, that feels tight Ailsa,� I complained.

�Not as tight as it is going to feel once I lace up the corset,� responded Ailsa.

Boy was Ailsa right! The harder she pulled, the tighter the dress got until I could barely breathe. 

�Slow down pet,� I continued to complain. �You&#8217;re cutting me in two!�

�Oh stop moaning,� replied Ailsa in a matter-of-fact tone. �I&#8217;m just about done anyway!�

I was being cut in two with every tug on the laces. How would I survive a day in this dress?

�There, you&#8217;re done,� announced Ailsa. 

I turned to look in the mirror and boy did I look ridiculous. All I could do was burst out laughing:

�I look ridiculous Ailsa,� I continued laughing. �I look like a sissy in a dress and a fairly ugly one at that!�

�Nonsense,� responded Ailsa. �Put on these shoes and the wig and you&#8217;ll look fine!�

What option did I have? I then sat down on the bed and pulled on the black leather shoes with a heel (not too large) and some straps.

�Hold on,� said Ailsa as she knelt down to help me.

I was struggling with the buckle but then I realised why. A tiny CLICK later and I knew these shoes were not coming off! Next Ailsa puled on a blonde wig. The hair was long and reached halfway to my arse.

�I bet my face still paints a picture,� I laughed!

�Ah but I have a solution here,� Ailsa also laughed as he picked up what looked like a hat.

As soon as she placed the hat on my head, a dark mesh fell over my face. 

�Ah so you&#8217;re veiling me Ailsa,� I laughed.

�Go on Dan,� requested Ailsa in a smug voice. �Look at yourself in the mirror now!�

Ailsa was right! I could no longer tell it was a boy in drag. I was covered in black from head to toe! A black hat with a black mesh veil; black leather and satin dress and black tights with shoes. Fuck, did I feel weird dressing this way in front of someone else? It was then I felt Ailsa putting her arms around me from behind:

�I really didn&#8217;t think you would go through with this,� she complemented me on being so adventurous.

�Neither did I,� I responded, running around to face Ailsa.

I then put my head down and our lips touched again but this time through a thin layer of satin mesh.

�Hold on a second until I hold this up,� I explained to Ailsa as I raised my arm to pull up the veil?

�No Dam leave it as it is,� replied Ailsa, moving in for another kiss. �This just adds to the fun of it.�

We kissed for a few minutes longer until Ailsa suggested I go back to the main house with her for some breakfast. It was now 10AM and I was getting a little peckish. As I walked behind Ailsa, I remembered the wonderful feeling of the Lycra tights against my legs. As we exited into the courtyard, the wind rushing up my skirt nearly made me come. Of course Ailsa had no idea what putting me into this dress actually meant to me but my goodness, it was a wonderful feeling! I helped Ailsa set the table and we chatted as she prepared a cooked breakfast:

�This feels really odd standing here beside you wearing this dress,� I explained to Ailsa. �Even though the veil hides my face, it really doesn&#8217;t help much.�

�To be honest Dan,� replied Ailsa. �I would never in a million years have expected you to accept my suggestion of you dressing up today. I&#8217;m so glad you have and I think we&#8217;re going to have a wonderful day together.�

�So what have you got in mind for today,� I quizzed this island beauty?

�I&#8217;m sure we can find something to do Dan,� replied Ailsa as she started serving breakfast.

We sat and chatted for ages over breakfast and extra coffee. It was clear Ailsa was enjoying my company and I guess even more due to the fact I was wearing the dress for her. My veil had come off and to be honest, I forgot all about the dress and how tight the built in corset was. As Ailsa cleared up, I called the airfield and told them about my decision to stay at least another day in Eigg to avoid the bad weather. The CFO (Chief Flying Officer) at the club explained that he thought my decision was very wise and the weather was to clear up later today so tomorrow (Monday) would be a better day for flying. I also checked the position with me flying Ailsa&#8217;s Cessna Caravan but I&#8217;d forgotten my license restricted me to a certain weight limit and the Caravan was over the legal limit of my license:

�I&#8217;m so sorry Ailsa,� I explained as soon as I came off the phone to the airfield. �It seems my pilot&#8217;s license doesn&#8217;t allow me to fly aircraft as heavy as your Caravan. The CFO has suggested that he come up sometime and check the aircraft over. He would also be happy to broker the sale for a small fee if that is what you want?�

�That&#8217;s so kind of you Dan,� responded Ailsa. �I have no pilot&#8217;s license and have no need for the plane so I&#8217;d be delighted if you can help me sell it.�

�I will do my best to ensure you get a fair price Ailsa,� I promised.

We hugged again and Ailsa suggested we go upstairs so that she could show me Peter&#8217;s collection of costumes.

�Before we go put this back on please,� asked Ailsa, handing me the hat and veil.

�If I didn&#8217;t know any better,� I complained. �I would think you wanted my face hidden!�

�Oh not at all,� Ailsa stopped to hug me again. �I just love veils and masks and it turns me on so much to see you in that dress with the hat and veil.�

I then followed Alisa up the large staircase and into a large room:

�I guess this room never gets rented out,� I asked?

�No chance,� replied Ailsa. �I have five rooms to rent out and two rooms are kept as my private accommodation. To be honest, I&#8217;ve no idea what to do with this room. It means so much to me and I can&#8217;t bear to get rid of these special cloths that were so much a part of Peter&#8217;s and my life.�

We had now entered a massive walk-in closet with rows of hanging space, loaded with oversized female attire. The collection was all dresses, blouses, skirts, corsets and jumpers. The drawers were full of pants, bras, tights, stockings and scarves. There were also shoes and boots with varying heel sizes and at ten polystyrene heads with various wigs.

�So what do you think Dan,� asked Ailsa?

�This collection is unbelievable Ailsa,� I response.

�Is there anything that really takes your fancy Dan,� Ailsa press further?

I stood and looked at the collection:

�To be honest, I&#8217;d be happy to wear any of these outfits for you Ailsa.� I tried to move to what I really wanted to try. �There is one thing I&#8217;ve always wanted to try and it isn&#8217;t in here.�

�What&#8217;s that,� Ailsa asked, looking up at me?

�I&#8217;ve always fantasised about wearing a straightjacket,� I dropped the only hint I could.

Ailsa just put her arms around me and gave me a hug.

�That&#8217;s settled then,� she replied. �I&#8217;ll need to get you into something else other than that dress but I would be delighted to make your dreams come true this afternoon.�

I leant down and kissed Ailsa again through the mesh of my veil. She raised her hands and pulled the hat off, clearing my vision and access to a little tongue to tongue action.

�I think if you put on this jersey and pinafore,� explained Ailsa. �Any of my straightjackets should fit you perfectly!�

Ailsa then helped me out the dress after releasing the tight laced corset and pulling down the rear zip. Once out of the dress, Ailsa hung it back up and handed me a black jersey and red &amp; black tartan pinafore to put on. Back in the bedroom, I&#8217;d slipped easily into the jersey, which had a bodice and poppers to keep the clingy wool like material tight to my skin over the Lycra tights. Before pulling on the pinafore, I headed for the ensuite to take a leak under Ailsa&#8217;s direction as it might be some time before my next toilet break. Before long I was now dressed and following Ailsa back out into the courtyard and over to the cell block. The wind still blew up my very short skirt and around my soft Lycra clad legs, which was such a wonderful experience.

�So which jacket would you like to try first,� asked Ailsa as we entered the storeroom?

�I&#8217;ve no idea, what do you suggest,� I asked?

�How about this leather one,� suggested Ailsa as she lifted a heavy black leather straightjacket off a hanger?

�I&#8217;m in your capable hands,� I laughed in response.

Ailsa just laughed herself and directed me to slide both arms into the long lined leather arms. Ailsa then turned me around (as expected) and pulled up the rear zip, which started to pull the leather jacket tight:

�Okay Dan,� ordered Ailsa who turned me around to face her gain. �Pass each arm through the loop in front and pretend you are hugging yourself?�

I&#8217;d seen this done may times on You tube so I slid each arm through the leather loop in front and allowed Ailsa to pull hard on the straps at the end of each sleeve as she fed them into the buckling system at the back. Soon I was getting the breath squeezed out of me again and I loved every second of it! 

�That should keep you,� laughed Ailsa, moving onto the final strap.

She pulled the crotch strap through my legs and started to buckle it up very tightly.

�I can see you&#8217;re really enjoying this,� teased Ailsa, referring to the rock hard-on I was experiencing as my dreams of been put into a straightjacket came true. �Don&#8217;t be so embarrassed Dan, it&#8217;s absolutely natural!�

With that, Ailsa brushed her hand along my shaft, which was hidden behind those ridiculous pants and wonderful soft Lycra tights. I was then directed to follow her to the tight room (the padded cell). During the short walk, I felt the power of the straightjacket and couldn&#8217;t wait to be locked into the padded cell. I was directed to stop out the padded cell while Ailsa bent down and using a tiny bespoke key, she unlocked the buckle on my shoes and then directed me into the cell again:

�Wait there, I&#8217;ll be back in a second,� asked Ailsa?

She didn&#8217;t bother to lock the door but soon Ailsa returned from the cell I&#8217;d spent last night in, with the leather hood I&#8217;d worn yesterday. 

�You know I enjoy masks so this shouldn&#8217;t be a surprise,� laughed Ailsa as pulled the thick lined leather over my &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;head and sorted out the zip. �I&#8217;m going into town and will be gone about two hours Dan, is that alright?�

�I think I&#8217;ll survive,� I laughed from behind the leather mask.

�That&#8217;s great,� replied Ailsa as she kissed me on my leather covered mouth and slammed the padded cell door closed.

Yes, this was my dream come true but what the hell was I going to do for the next couple of hours in this tiny padded cell? Wearing what I could only describe as my dream outfit: Lycra tights, tight jersey with a short skirt (granted part of a pinafore), which was now bunched up due to the crotch strap of my leather straightjacket. I&#8217;ve spent hours looking at girls on the internet trying to escape from a tight straightjacket and wondered what it would be like. I had to at least try and escape from it so that is exactly what I attempted for the first part of my enforced stay in the padded cell. As you would expect, escaping the clutches of the leather straightjacket was never going to be an option! Fighting the thing just made me very, very hot and yes, I loved every second I fought the jacket, then rested and started to fight it again. I&#8217;d no idea how long I&#8217;d spent in the jacket and padded cell when I finally heard the door being unlocked:

�I see you haven&#8217;t escaped my jacket,� laughed Ailsa!

�Have you been gone two hours Ailsa,� I asked this beautiful girl who was still wearing her black dress, tights and the red shoes, belt and silk scarf.

�Actually two-and-a-half hours Dan,� replied Ailsa. �Doesn&#8217;t time fly when you&#8217;re having fun?�

I just stared at Ailsa as she took off her high heeled shoes and stepped onto the padded floor.

�You&#8217;re sweating Dan,� laughed Ailsa. �Have you been trying to escape all the time I&#8217;ve been away?�

�Well it&#8217;s my first time in a straightjacket and I had to give it a good test drive,� I teased in response.

Ailsa then helped me to my feet and started unbuckling the jacket. I&#8217;d no idea how sore my arms were when they finally fell free from the tight grip of the leather jacket. Soon I was free and Ailsa was straightening out the mini skirt of my pinafore:

�Come with me Dan,� Ailsa now requested?

I said nothing as we exited the padded cell and entered the self-bondage cell as I called it:

�I think you need a rest,� explained Ailsa as she instructed me to lie down on the bed from outside the cell as she fiddled with the timer system outside.

As I flopped down on my back, Ailsa pulled back the duvet to reveal the four-point shackle set. Under Ailsa&#8217;s instruction I slipped my feet into the two shackles at the bottom of the bed. As I popped my hands into the shackles either side of the pillow so just above my head, the automatic mechanism took over and the cuffs started to pull tight, trapping my limbs in their grip:

�How long have you set the timer for,� I asked?

�That&#8217;s for me to know and you to find out,� replied Ailsa as she left the cell!

She wasn&#8217;t gone long as Ailsa re-entered the self-bondage cell, wearing her high heeled red shoes again and this time she pulled the door closed, again engaging the locking mechanism and therefore trapping us both in this tiny cell for a pre-set length of time, only known to Ailsa. Without saying a word, Ailsa stood by the wall and inserted her wrists into the wall shackles, which soon closed tight ensuring my partner in bondage was as trapped as me:

�So what should we talk about Dan,� asked Ailsa? �We&#8217;re here for a while so let&#8217;s get to know each other!�

�Okay Ailsa,� I came straight back with the million dollar question. �Are you really horny right now?�

�You know I am Dan and there is nothing either of us can do about it, is there,� replied Ailsa?

I just laughed as we spent some quality time together bound apart but locked inside the self-timer cell:

�So Dan,� Ailsa start to prod my inner most secrets again? �Have you ever dressed as a girl before?�

Did I really want to answer that question from a girl I barely knew? Sadly, my silence really did the answering for me:

�I guess the answer is yes Dan,� Ailsa answered her own question. �Why are you embarrassed about it, lots of straight guys dress up in girlie cloths; it brings them nearer to their feminine side!�

�It&#8217;s alright for you Ailsa,� I answered sort of grumpy that another one of my secrets was out. �Dressing up is something I&#8217;ve done on my own for years and I&#8217;ve told no-one.�

�Well until now,� laughed Ailsa!

�Yes until now,� I replied.

�So have you never been married Dan,� Ailsa continued?

�Yes,� I replied. �I divorced nearly ten years ago just before I set-up my own business. My ex-wife clearly wanted different things than me and we moved apart. One benefit to come from it is that fact I can order what I want from the internet and I&#8217;ve got no-one to answer to. I suppose it also meant when I sold my business, I didn&#8217;t need to share the profits!�

�To be honest Dan,� Ailsa replied, still manacled to the cell wall. �I wish I had someone to share my husband&#8217;s profits with. I&#8217;ll never need to work again but what fun is it when you&#8217;ve no-one to share the money with?�

�I suppose you&#8217;re right Ailsa,� I continued. �In saying that, I was happy to spend this summer flying around the UK and enjoying myself on my own. This stop has certainly changed things a little and to be honest, I&#8217;d like to see where our new friendship leads.�

�Me too Dan,� replied Ailsa. �I&#8217;d love to come over and hug you right now but I&#8217;m a little tied up right now!�

�Me too,� I laughed!

We both laughed at our situation and admitted we were as Horney as hell but sadly nothing either of us could do about it:

�What would do if you were free right now,� asked Ailsa?

�What if I was released from this bed and you were still cuffed to the wall,� I asked?

�Yes,� replied Ailsa!

�Would we still both be locked in the cell during this fantasy of yours,� I continued with Ailsa verbal teasing?

�Absolutely,� Ailsa came straight back at me!

I thought about that for a few seconds and responded:

�I&#8217;d like to drive you mad until you begged for an orgasm,� I blurted out. �Of course if you let me because I&#8217;d never do anything you wouldn&#8217;t want me to!�

�Ummm, that sounds so nice Dan,� purred Ailsa who now had her eyes closed. �So how would you do that?�

It was just then that my bonds released themselves and my wrists slipped free from the cuffs:

�Were they supposed to do that Ailsa,� I bought our conversation back to earth?

�Oh, I forgot,� replied Ailsa. �I can&#8217;t believe how times flies when you&#8217;re having fun. �Yeap, I set you cuffs for thirty minutes before mine and then another thirty minutes until the cell door opens.�

By now I&#8217;d managed to pull my ankles out of the other cuffs and was stretching all my limbs:

�So what was that you wanted me to do to you Ailsa,� I teased, rubbing my finger down the front of her black mini-dress?

Ailsa just smiled back at me:

�You know,� she teased.

It was then I reached behind her head and undid the tight knot on the red silk scarf that encircled her neck. As I pulled away the soft silk Ailsa said noting and just smiled back at me:

�Are you okay with this Ailsa,� I asked for clearance to continue?

�Remember Dan if I hum the national anthem, then it is time to stop,� explained Ailsa. �Until then you are free to do whatever you want!�

That couldn&#8217;t have been clearer! I then raised the scarf behind Ailsa&#8217;s head and pulled the two ends forward, wrapping the soft silk scarf around her head, covering her eyes and then tying if off again behind Ailsa&#8217;a head. I then moved away for a second and pulled the rear zip on the back of my leather mask. I wanted to be free from this head covering if I was to achieve my goal here. Finally free of the mask, which I&#8217;d been wearing for quite a few hours now, I approached my bound friend and kissed her on the lips, while running my fingers around her nipples. It was clear the dress would never come off while Ailsa&#8217;s hands were trapped in the wall cuffs so I pinched as best I could until I got the desired reaction. Ailsa continued to purr as I ran my other hand down the front of dress, now touching her thigh through those wonderful Lycra tights. I kissed her neck and this time Ailsa threw her head back:

�Oh Dam, that feels so good,� Ailsa cooed. 

�You haven&#8217;t felt anything yet,� I laughed.

�I hoped that would be the case Dan, go for it,� Ailsa continued to give her consent.

That was all the encouragement I needed to push my hand up and underneath the hen of Ailsa&#8217;s mini-dress and push hard with my fingers against her most private of areas. It was clear Ailsa had pants on underneath her tights so I needed to get my fingers in there if I was offer any pleasure in advance of the cuffs unlocking. I continued kissing her neck and pinching Ailsa&#8217;s nipples, which by now were like little bullets. There was no resistance when I pulled away the elastic of Ailsa&#8217;s tights, followed by her satin pants. My fingers then found what they were looking for and Ailsa certainly didn&#8217;t complain:

�You&#8217;re so good at this Dan,� complemented Ailsa.

�I aim to please Ailsa,� I teased and prodded my fingers even deeper into Ailsa&#8217;s very wet and warm place.

�Oh that feels so good,� Ailsa continued to approve of what I was doing and then turned her head to kiss me. �Harder Dan, please twist my nipples harder and fuck me with those fingers!�

This little minx knew exactly what she wanted and she panted even harder as my fingers worked their magic. Just before the end, Ailsa stepped it up a gear and was more demanding than ever:

�Twist harder, fuck harder,� she demanded!

It wasn&#8217;t long though until Ailsa&#8217;s demands paid off and her orgasm blew this cute middle-aged girl over the top. Pulling hard on the shackles that held her tight to the wall, Ailsa screamed and shuddered as a wave of pleasure ripped through her body. As she came off the high, I was still prodding with my fingers as the second wave of pleasure ripped through Ailsa like a speeding train. It was then that her cuffs released and Ailsa was able to pull her arms free and wrap them around my body:

�Of fuck that was good,� she screamed!

My sticky hands were now free of Ailsa&#8217;s pussy and I raised both hands toward her head, pulling the silk scarf down leaving it piled around her neck. We kissed again and being pushed back, I finally fell onto the bed, Ailsa standing over me, pulling off her black dress, revealing a black bra. Ailsa&#8217;s tights and pants were now hanging around her knees so they came off next, leaving this girl naked for the first time with me. She was now on a mission and pulled up my pinafore until she was able to pull the buttons on the bodice that held the black jersey tight to my body.

�Place your feet and hands into the cuffs,� Ailsa demanded as she pulled off her final piece of clothing, her black bra?

�What good will that do,� I asked as I did exactly what Ailsa requested to find the cuffs automatically retract, pinning me back against her cell bunk?

�You see Dam� explained Ailsa as she started pulling the scarf from her neck: �If you do not set the timer, it will default to one hour if you pull the door closed, place your wrists in the wall shackles or as you&#8217;ve just found out, place all your limbs into the bed cuffs!�

I was now learning new things about his cell all the time we played in it! Ailsa&#8217;s scarf was now free from around her neck and it was clear I was about to lose my vision as she pulled the long red silk material around my head, cutting off all light.

�Open wide,� Ailsa now demanded as I could feel her packing something into my mouth, effectively gagging me. �Tights can be so useful!�

You&#8217;re right, my mouth was now filled by Ailsa&#8217;s tights and by now she was pulling both legs around my head and tying them into a knot inside my mouth. All I could do was MUMPTH in acceptance as the second knot was pulled tight, gagging me completely!

�You can still hum the national anthem if you want to Dan,� Ailsa laughed!

I&#8217;d no intention of giving up yet as this wild island girl took full control of the situation. Soon the black leather hood was back on my head covering the gag and blindfold that kept in in complete darkness and silence:

�I told you I like masks,� Ailsa continued to laugh as I was pushed back onto my back and Ailsa impaled herself on my rock hard cock.

Ailsa was now like a vixen on heat as she pounded up and down on me, giving herself at least one more orgasm before I exploded. Again all I could do was MUMPTH in appreciation as Ailsa finally climbed off:

�Did you enjoy that,� asked Ailsa as she got off and used the toilet in the cell?

I MUMPTHED hard in my gag and nodded:

�Glad to hear that,� replied Ailsa. �The door is now open but I&#8217;m going to leave you until your cuffs release themselves. I could of course reduce the timer manually but that wouldn&#8217;t be any fun, would it so enjoy yourself, my darling!�

Those were Ailsa&#8217;s last words as she left the cell and therefore left me to wait on my own until the cuffs released me from the cell bed. 

I guess my wait was a little over forty minutes before I felt the pressure on my ankles and wrists subside and I was free to pull myself from the bed cuffs. My mask was first, followed by the blindfold and finally the gag. As soon as I was free, I sat up on the bed, pulled up the horrible tummy-tuck pants and tights, followed by sorting out the jersey and pinafore, which had both been pulled up around my chest during the session that had ended less than twenty minutes ago. As soon as I was happy with my appearance, I picked up the red silk scarf. It felt so soft that I had to give it a go so I wrapped it twice around my neck and left two ends dangling over my chest. I then picked up Ailsa&#8217;s used tights and the leather mask I&#8217;d enjoyed so much and decided to head for the house, via the storeroom of course.

I was slightly worried that Ailsa might have locked one or two sets of bars to block my exit but I was in luck as I was able to make my way directly from the cells, passed the play rooms and finally the store room. I placed the leather mask where it belonged and took a closer look at some of the other masks. One that grabbed my attention was a simple plastic mask with nose, mouth and eye holes and a bobbed mass of black hair attached. This might serve my purpose well this afternoon as I was still dressed as a girl. I therefore lifted the plastic face mask and pull the rear spandex hood over my head and fiddled until I was happy with my reflection in the mirror. Yes, I was once again looking like a slightly overweight female with a plastic face mask, black bobbed hair and wearing a pinafore with black tights. The red silk scarf added to my afternoon outfit but I&#8217;d forgotten about my shoes. I therefore headed back to the padded cell and noticed the black leather straightjacket still lying just inside the cell and my shoes lying just outside the open door. I picked up the straightjacket before slipping back into the shoes and yes, I did up the strap, which locked them onto my feet again. Happy I was ready for the outside, I headed back to the store room with the straightjacket. Once it was back on its rack, I headed outside and into a windy Sunday afternoon and the main house:

�Hi honey I&#8217;m home,� I called out as I entered the empty kitchen!

There was no response so I headed further into the house:

�Ailsa, are you there,� I called out?

Again no response so I headed upstairs towards the bedrooms. You should note that in two days I&#8217;d only visited the spare bedroom so far and never managed to work my way into Ailsa&#8217;s special place:

�Ailsa, are you there,� I called out while knocking on her bedroom door?

There was no response so I popped my head around the door and could barely believe what I saw! Lying naked in the middle of a large four-poster bed, except for a tight PVC hood over her head, breathing heavily through the straw type tube was Ailsa with a vibrator in her right hand, buzzing like crazy as she brought herself back on an edge that she must have only come down from less than sixty minutes ago. I stood there in amazement. I knew I had to do something but what I&#8217;d no idea. As I approached, Ailsa still didn&#8217;t realise that I was watching her. It was then I noticed the bottom drawer of her bedside cabinet was open and a pair of handcuffs lying on top. I had to act quickly so I grabbed the stainless steel modern-day manacles and grabbed the expectant Ailsa by the left shoulder, pulling her over onto her front. She let go of the vibrator, which was still buzzing inside her pussy just in time for me to grab her right arm, forcing both wrists into the handcuffs behind her back. She was screaming into the gag that clearly filed her mouth but little audible noise came out as I flipped her back onto her back, now pressing down on her bound arms. I said nothing as I took control of the vibrator and continued where Ailsa had no option but to stop. 

�Are you enjoying this, my sweet,� I teased, placing my mouth close to where her ears were?

All Ailsa could do was nod in reply. It was then I decided to make things very interesting. At the base of the breathing tube, where it met the thick PVC mask, was a tiny valve. I then twisted it ninety degrees and watched as Ailsa soon realised access to life-giving air was now completely cut off. She started to buck against the bed, trying to pull her arms free from the handcuffs but that was never going to happen! She screamed into the gag but soon her air supply was in such short supply that the MUMPTHING stopped and she lay still on the bed, trying hard to breath, which of course couldn&#8217;t happen. I kept pulsing the vibrator in-and-out as Ailsa&#8217;s situation became critical but then I watched in delight as a massive orgasm ripped through her entire body. At that very point, I kept playing with the vibrator but turned the valve 45 degrees, allowing at least a little air into Ailsa&#8217;s mask. She started gasping for what little oxygen there was as I continued with the vibrator, quickly bringing her to another orgasm. That was at least four in two hours so I thought she would have had enough by now and I pulled the buzzing toy free from her soaking wet pussy. She was still gasping for air so I turned the valve again until she was able to breathe freely. Ailsa lay still on the bed as life returned to normal but I wanted to remove the mask and see how she was. Easing her onto her side, I pulled on the rear zip and slid the heavy PVC off her head, revealing a sweat soaked scalp below:

�Thank you Dan,� praised Ailsa. �I&#8217;ve fantasised about someone doing that to me. It was even better than I expected!�

�You&#8217;re welcome,� I replied in a soft voice, running my hands through Ailsa&#8217;s loving auburn hair.

It was then Ailsa blinked and was able to see my plastic face mask and attached bobbed wig:

�The mask really suits you Dan,� laughed Ailsa.

�I&#8217;m glad you like it honey,� I replied, lifting the naked Ailsa into a position that I could now hug her.

We then sat on Ailsa&#8217;s bed hugging (well me holding her as her hands were still cuffed behind her back) and whispering into each other&#8217;s ears.

�If you tell me where your keys are Ailsa, I&#8217;ll release your arms,� I suggested.
�They&#8217;re in the drawer,� replied Ailsa �but I&#8217;m not sure I&#8217;m ready to be free yet.�

�Sounds perfect Ailsa,� I continued what was going to be an all-day game. �I&#8217;d like you to get dressed again in the outfit you worse earlier and I&#8217;ll then put you back into the cuffs!�

Ailsa agreed and soon she was pulling back on her bra, pants, a fresh pair of black tights and the dress she wore yesterday. After the red shoes and belt went back on, I pulled the red silk scarf from my neck and handed it to this beauty:

�Thank you kind sir,� Ailsa replied as she took the scarf and wrapped it around her neck, tying a knot in front and leaving the rest of the scarf falling from her neck.

�You&#8217;re welcome my dear,� I responded, picking up the empty handcuffs. �Please turn around so I can get you back into these cuffs?�

Ailsa complied and soon I had her wrists locked once again behind her back. I then led her out of the house and back towards the out building play area. She followed me to the cell with the cage and then looked at me as I asked her to get in:

�You&#8217;re not putting me in there are you,� asked Ailsa?

�You&#8217;re going in, like it or not,� I responded, pulling Ailsa&#8217;s legs from her, forcing her down so I could force her forward and into the cage.

Once she was forced beyond the cage door, I slammed it closed!

�Enjoy yourself,� I laughed as I headed out of the cell, closing the heavy door behind me and therefore locking Ailsa behind two doors this time. No need to do anything with the corridor gates because there was no way Ailsa was going anywhere!

As I headed back through the cell-block, on route to the house, I had to take a look the other rooms again. I wanted to have a go in the dentists chair but there was no way to bind myself into the bloody thing. I therefore sat in the large chair and did up the right wrist cuff and held onto the other, trying to image what it would like to actually be constrained to this fantastic chair. My stomach was now telling me it was time for something to eat so I released my right arm and popped back into the storeroom to replace the mask I was wearing. I&#8217;d no problem working in the kitchen while wearing a pinafore, tights and heels but preparing something to eat while wearing a mask was something else.

Back in the kitchen I checked Ailsa&#8217;s fridge and cupboards. I easily found chicken, rice, onions and enough herbs and spices to pull together a really nice curry. Sadly no beer in the house but I was able to pull together a great meal in about thirty minutes. With the curry and rice being kept warm in the oven, I headed back for Ailsa. Unlocking and entering the cell with the cage, I laughed at my new friend as she sat on the padded floor with her arms still pinned behind her back but leaning against the bars of the cage:

�That doesn&#8217;t look that comfortable,� I teased as I unlocked the gate to the cage.

�It&#8217;s not bad,� responded Ailsa. �You should try it sometime.�

�Maybe sometime,� I replied. �I&#8217;ve made us both some dinner so would you like to come out of there?�

Ailsa wasted no time in manoeuvring herself towards the open gate. As she reached me, I helped my bound friend to her feet:

�Are you going to release my hands,� asked Ailsa who turned to show me the cuffs still holding her poor arms tightly behind her back?

�Maybe later,� I laughed, taking Ailsa by the arm and leading her out of the cell-block, passed the other rooms. �I have to try that dentist chair sometime!�

�That can easily be arranged,� Ailsa laughed as we exited the outhouse and cross the courtyard to the main house. �Umm, that smells really good Dan!�

�I hope it tastes as good as it smells Ailsa,� I replied taking hold of Ailsa&#8217;s arms and using my key to unlock the cuffs.

As her arms were freed from the confines of the high-grade steel handcuffs, Ailsa turned towards me and kissed me:

�This has been a fantastic weekend Dan,� Ailsa explained. �A day of fun and now a curry; what more could a girl ask for?�

�I just hope you enjoy it Ailsa,� I replied taking the piping hot food out of the oven.

We sat for the next hour enjoying the food, a bottle of wine and each other&#8217;s company:

�Do you have to go home tomorrow Dan,� asked Ailsa?

�Why, do you want me to stay,� I teased, taking another sit of wine?

�You know I do,� responded Ailsa.

I thought about my response for a while:

�Why don&#8217;t I head home and look at setting up a website for your business Ailsa,� I explained my plan. �You clearly have an opportunity here and one I think we can capitalise on it if that is okay with you?�

Ailsa now took her time to respond:

�Who would help me run my business Dan,� asked Ailsa?

�If you were happy to have me as a minority partner, I&#8217;d be delighted to work with you.

�I had hoped you would have offered Dan but how do we fly guests up here,� Ailsa asked again?

�I think I could obtain a license given a few hours training,� I replied. �I&#8217;d be happy to invest in the time but I think I could find a pilot to help us out in the meantime.�

My plans were coming together and Ailsa and I continued were our ideas as we cleared up the dishes and made coffee. It was settled; I would fly home tomorrow, start on the website and bring up a pilot to take the Caravan back to Lanarkshire for sale. Our idea was to buy a smaller aircraft (4-seat) that I could easily obtain a license for:

�So when will you come back to Eigg Dan,� asked Ailsa with some urgency in her voice?

�How about next weekend,� I asked?

Ailsa just threw her arms around me and we kissed:

�I really think we can make this work Dan,� she praised my ideas.

�Well whatever we agree on, would you like to fly back to Bothwell with me for the week and we can sort a few bits and pieces out,� I offered as I planned to bring Ailsa home for a week to continue our preparations.

That was settled. I would fly home tomorrow. I&#8217;d then fly back on Friday morning (weather permitting) with another pilot who would head straight back with the Caravan. I&#8217;d then spend another weekend with Ailsa and she would come back to Bothwell with me for a week.

�So what do we do for the rest of the evening Dan,� asked Ailsa?

�Well honey, you&#8217;re my prisoner today so you&#8217;re spending the night in the same cell I spent last night in,� I explained what was going to happen tonight.

Ailsa just smiled and offered to head upstairs and change into her night outfit. I then cleared away the coffee cups and prepared to join her in the bedroom. As I made my way up upstairs Ailsa was standing in a dark red satin nightshirt but still wearing her black opaque tights.

�Do you always wear tights,� I asked Ailsa?

�Yes,� replied Ailsa. �I love how they make my legs feel so you&#8217;ll find me wearing them day and night! I don&#8217;t think you&#8217;ll have a problem with that do you?�

�Not at all,� I replied, holding up the empty handcuffs Ailsa had spent so much time in today. �Come here and turn around gorgeous, remember, you&#8217;re still my prisoner!�

Ailsa offered no resistance as she approached, turned around and brought her arms behind her back to accept the cuffs:

�You&#8217;re not going to leave me in these all night are you Dan� asked Ailsa as I locked her hands into the steel bracelets?

�No, not at all,� I came straight back, turning my now bound friend around. �This is just my security as I walk you back to your cell.�

Taking Ailsa by the arm, I led her back downstairs, through the kitchen and out into the cool night air. Soon we were back in the outhouse and walking past the open torture rooms. Finally we entered the cell I&#8217;d spent last night in. As we entered the tiny room, I asked Ailsa to sit on the bed while I picked up my overnight bag and toiletries. I first placed them outside the cell before heading back in to kiss Ailsa good night:

�I think I&#8217;m going to enjoy spending nights with you sweetheart,� I explained, rubbing my hands along with Lycra covered legs.

�If you go back into the spare room, where I&#8217;d like you to spend the night Dan,� Ailsa explained what she wanted me to wear in bed. �You will find several larger nightshirts just like this. Why don&#8217;t you wear ome and the tights tonight and see how it feels?�

�I might just do that,� I replied, before kissing Ailsa one more time before locking her in for the night. 

I then took my keys and unlocked Ailsa&#8217;s wrist before taking the handcuffs and leaving the cell:

�Goodnight my dear,� I said before slamming the heavy cell door closed!

I could hear Ailsa wishing me goodnight as headed out into the corridor, pickling up my overnight bag a locking the first set of bars as I exited. I locked the others as well (just to be on the safe side, not that Ailsa was going anywhere) and headed back to the spare bedroom. I was prepared to do what Ailsa had suggested and after unlocking the shoes and pulling off the pinafore and jumper, I pulled on a dark blue satin nightshirt and climbed into the massive double bed.


Monday morning and time to go home:

Morning came far too quickly, lying in the extremely confortable bed. To be honest, I thought wearing the tights to bed would have been an enormous turn on but quite frankly, I&#8217;d forgotten all about them, which I guess had something to do with wearing them all day yesterday. As life finally returned to me, I remembered about last night and locking Ailsa in the same cell I&#8217;d spent Saturday night in. I had a choice to go a fetch Ailsa now or get dressed first. What the hell, I&#8217;d go and get her right now!

The trip across the court yard, wearing only a night dress and tights was a cold one. Even though it was early summer, it was still cold in the north western Scottish islands. I had found a pair of flip-flops to pull on my feet. I&#8217;d no intention of handcuffing Ailsa this morning so armed only with a massive bunch of keys, I made my way through several barred gates that needed to be unlocked before I finally arrived at Ailsa&#8217;s cell. Using the observation hatch I first checked on my prisoner:

�Good morning sleepy head,� I greeted Ailsa this morning who was still hiding under the duvet.

�Good morning Dan,� responded Ailsa who by now was climbing out of bed as I used my key to unlock the heavy iron door. �Ah, you wore the nightshirt and tights last night, how did it feel?�

�To be honest Ailsa, I&#8217;m not sure because I fell asleep as soon as my head hit the pillow,� I replied. �I have to admit that it does feel really good today though.

We hugged and kissed before agreeing that a shower and then breakfast would be a good idea. As we walked out of the cell-block Ailsa turned towards me:

�Hey Dan, you wanted to try the chair didn&#8217;t you,� asked Ailsa as we passed the open torture rooms?

�I&#8217;m not sure we have time to play this morning honey,� I tried to get out of what Ailsa was suggesting, while secreting trying to ignore common sense and allow Ailsa to do her worst. �Go on Dan, you know you want to!�

Ailsa was right and I followed her into the room I&#8217;d wanted to try out all weekend. Under Ailsa&#8217;s instructions I climbed onto the large chair and allowed Ailsa to first of all buckle my wrists into the leather cuffs. My ankles were next and then the strap that would hold my waist tight to the dentist&#8217;s chair. The final cuff was the large leather collar that Ailsa wasted no time in duckling around my neck. Now I was stuck!

�Right you enjoy yourself and I&#8217;ll go and have a shower,� explained Ailsa before kissing me on the mouth and leaving the room, closing and locking the door behind her.

As hard as I tried for the next half-an-hour, I couldn&#8217;t remove the cuffs. I was stuck and I knew there was no choice but to accept my bound position until Ailsa returned for me. Even if I could escape this chair, where could I go; I was locked in the room anyway! I therefore sat back and waited for Ailsa to return. I hadn&#8217;t long to wait as the outer door unlocked and my gorgeous friend arrived wearing a floral print summer dress with her legs clad in our favourite black opaque tights. Ailsa hands were behind her back. I wondered if she&#8217;d cuffed her own hands but I guessed she was hiding something. As my captor approached, her grin grew. Ailsa then placed something on the floor out of view before approaching again with what I recognised as a ball gag in her hand:

�You used this on me during Saturday while I was in the stocks so I think you need to be repaid,� teased Ailsa as she wasted no time at gagging me.

The large red rubber ball packed my mouth wall as Ailsa insured it was staying in place by pulling very tight on the buckle:

�Umm, that&#8217;s better,� laughed Ailsa as she pulled up my nightdress, pulled down my tights, followed by my pants.

As expected, my dick had betrayed me and was standing to attention.

�Oh my,� teased Ailsa. �Danny&#8217;s dick is very big this morning!�

Again, I couldn&#8217;t respond as Ailsa headed over to the sink and picked up a cloth. Using very, very cold water, Ailsa returned to wash my cock, which shrunk the second the cold water splashed onto him. It was then Ailsa knelt down and picked up another item. Horror cut across my face in realisation that Ailsa was about to fit me with a chastity tube. I screamed into the gag but little exited my packed mouth:

�Calm down Danny boy,� purred Ailsa as she slid my flaccid cock into the steel tube. �This is my little insurance that you do return next week.

Nothing she could do would calm me down as Ailsa fitted the ring around my balls and clamped the two parts together with a CLICK!

�There you go my sweet boy,� Ailsa continued to tease. �You&#8217;re all mine now!�

Ailsa then unbuckled and removed the gag:

�Come on Ailsa, the chastity tube isn&#8217;t necessary,� I pleaded!

�Oh but it is,� responded Ailsa. �As long as you return next Friday, then I know you&#8217;re coming back and I&#8217;ll remove it forever.�

�Ailsa, I will be faithful to you, I promise,� I continued to plead. �I&#8217;ve got no intention of not coming back and in fact I&#8217;m looking forward to it so there is no need to lock up my cock.�

Quite honestly, chastity belts did fascinate me but I was a three-a-day guy and not being able to come until next Friday at the earliest scared the crap out of me:

�Well Dan, the key to the tube is locked in my safe back in the house so don&#8217;t think about doing anything silly when I let you go, is that clear,� Ailsa demanded my attention?

�Ailsa I will never hurt you,� I replied a little shocked at this morning&#8217;s events. �I&#8217;m not happy about this but as long as you never use it again, I&#8217;ll accept it this once only.�

�I will not promise to never use the chastity tube again Dan but I will promise to free you the second you get back here on Friday,� Ailsa set-out her goal for my release on Friday.

Once I&#8217;d calmed down, Ailsa released me from the dentist&#8217;s chair and we headed back to the house. Ailsa prepared breakfast and I took a shower, regretting allowing Ailsa the minx to lock me into the bloody chair in the first place. I dressed this morning in my jeans and a clean T-Shirt. I packed my bag and headed downstairs to a wonderful breakfast with the girl that now had a lot of power over me:

�I&#8217;m not comfortable with the chastity tube Ailsa but I&#8217;ll accept it until Friday but you MUST promise to release me the second I get back,� I set out my demands.

Ailsa just came over, sat on my knee and we kissed:

�Dan, you are the first man I&#8217;ve ever looked at since Peter died,� she explained. �I do not want to lose you so please allow me this one tiny bit of control?�

We kissed again before the 5 minute walk back the hanger. Ailsa stood back and watched as I opened the large hanger doors and pulled my sport plane out into the morning sun. Once out, I gave what I thought was the only girl in my life the once over before opening the cockpit canopy and throwing my bag behind the pilots seat. I went back to Ailsa and we hugged and kissed for another ten minutes before I climbed into the aircraft. Checks complete, I closed the canopy and started the engine. I waved again the Ailsa as I taxied out and down the runway before turning around, applying full power and climbing into the bright blue morning sky. Turning around for a low pass, I waved my final goodbyes to Ailsa before heading south-east, climbing to 4,500 feet for the cruise home. Calling up Scottish Control I announced my position and then settled back for the ninety minute flight back to Lanarkshire.

As I watched the sparse but beautiful Scotch west coast countryside fall below me, I reflected on what was the most amazing weekend of my life. It was then reality set back in as my cock fought to grow in his steel tube, a prison that would keep him under Ailsa&#8217;s control until I returned n Friday.

Island Adventure &#8211; Part 2


Introduction:

In part one of my island adventure we met two fictional characters:


Dan Skinner from Bothwell in Lanarkshire who had recently sold his business for several million Pounds and bought a small sport aircraft. During his first long flight of the early summer (June) he had been forced to land at a remote airfield on the island of Eigg, off the northwest coast of Scotland. This is where Dan met our second character:



Ailsa MacDonald who had moved to Eigg with her husband &#8216;Peter&#8217; many years earlier to set-up an alternative B&amp;B business. Ailsa and Peter had refurbished an old house with a sinister past, which gave them both an outlet for their alternative B&amp;B, a bondage hotel for the kinkier type of guest. 


Sadly Peter had died 6 months before Dan&#8217;s forced landing in Eigg and this set off Dan and Ailsa on a journey of discovery to try and establish the old house as a kinky B&amp;B and hopefully a sustainable business.

As Dan and Ailsa got to know each other on that forced weekend together, they realised that they had a similar taste in cross-dressing, masks, bondage and being locked-up for periods of time. It was only when Dan prepared to fly home on Monday morning to set-up a website for Ailsa&#8217;s business, did he find himself being locked into a chastity tube at the hands of Ailsa, who wanted to ensure his faithful return on the following Friday.


Back in Lanarkshire and a business to set-up:

I arrived back in Lanarkshire less than two hours after leaving Ailsa&#8217;a place on Eigg. I took some stick from the CFI (Chief Flying Instructor) about taking three days to do a four-hour return flight. Little did he know the fun I&#8217;d had during my weekend of discovery? We did make arrangements to fly back to Eigg on Friday morning (weather permitting) so he could bring back the Caravan and put it up for sale. Back in the car, I wasted no time in calling Ailsa:

�Hello Ailsa MacDonald speaking,� came that beautiful island accent answering the home phone.

�Hello my dearest,� I teased as I drove home towards Bothwell. 

�Ah you made it back to the mainland Dan,� asked Ailsa?

�Of course I did Ailsa, what did you expect,� I laughed? Surely my flying isn&#8217;t that bad, I thought to myself?

�So are you missing me already,� asked Ailsa?

�Of course,� I replied. �Are you missing me?�

�Naturally Dan but remember, I still control you,� teased Ailsa.

�How could I forget,� I sarcastically responded. �Every time I think about you and the fantastic weekend we&#8217;ve just had, my dick brings me down to reality!�

Ailsa just burst out laughing on the other end of the phone and told me that was her goal.

�I&#8217;m going to start on the website when I get home Ailsa,� I explained my plans. �Tomorrow can you take as many digital pictures as possible and mail them to me?�

�No problem Dan but where do you want me to take the pictures,� asked Ailsa?

�Please only take pictures inside the cell-block and interrogation suite,� I replied. �I&#8217;d rather try to keep the exact location of your house anonymous and I have a plan to keep it that way. I&#8217;m sure that will add to the fun of our business plan!�

�Don&#8217;t you mean your business plan Dan,� teased Ailsa?

�It is your house Ailsa, your outhouse and your cells,� I sarcastically replied. �I genuinely want to help you promote it and if it becomes a successful business, then we can see where our partnership leads.�

�I know Dan and I trust you 100%,� responded Ailsa, feeling slightly guilty. �You don&#8217;t need my money so I guess you&#8217;re just trying to help a girl who has a tiny bit of control over your life right now!�

I then started to laugh, which then led to the usual I LOVE YOU before be broke the call and I finished my short drive home.

During the next three days I set-up the website and started the basics to market Ailsa&#8217;s fantastic facility. Ailsa started to e-mail me lots of photographs. Her broadband wasn&#8217;t keeping up so after a quick call to BT, I arranged to have her service upgraded by the time I arrived on Friday. By Thursday afternoon I had the basis of a website and several Google Ads directing web searches to our website. I even started some direct marketing of European groups and forums and soon I was receiving plenty of enquiries.&nbsp; It was exciting starting up a new business. I did it once before so I was confident I could do it again!

I wanted to add video to the website so seeing Ailsa was online via Skype, I gave her a call:

�Hello honey,� she opened the conversation as our PC&#8217;s connected and I saw her beautiful face on my monitor.

�Hello sweetheart, I&#8217;m still working,� I teased as it was now well after eleven!

�So you are Dan,� replied Ailsa who was lying in her bed. �Are you still wearing the belt?�

�How the fuck can I get it off,� I laughed?

�Show me,� Ailsa demanded!

I then stood up, unzipped my jeans and pulled down my boxers so Ailsa could see her hideous contraction that trapped my poor cock:

�Does it hurt,� asked Ailsa with a smile from one ear to the other?

�Yes but only when he tries to get hard,� I replied. �So now I&#8217;ve shown you my imprisoned cock, prove to me you&#8217;re wearing tights to bed?�

Ailsa just laughed again and then pointed the laptop and her webcam at her legs, which were clad in black Lycra.

�You love my legs don&#8217;t you Dan,� teased Ailsa?

�You know I do Ailsa,� I replied. �Anyway we have work to do so I plan to take some video on the weekend so I trust you&#8217;re prepared to be my wiling actress?�

�Of course,� responded Ailsa. �But only if my face is hidden!�

�That shouldn&#8217;t be an issue with your collection of masks and helmets,� I came straight back at her!

After a few more minutes, we said &#8216;goodnight&#8217; and we dropped the call. I then packed a hold-all for my weekend away and popped the laptop into a bag for the flight tomorrow.


Friday morning and my trip back to Eigg:

I was ready to leave the house but as I went over to switch off my desktop PC, I saw Ailsa was online. As her PC connected, I saw she was wearing something weird:

�Good morning honey, what the fuck are you wearing,� I asked Ailsa?

I was referring to the red tartan hooded dress that looked heavy and probably uncomfortable in the summer heat.

�It&#8217;s my uniform,� responded Ailsa. �Do you like it?�

�Stand up and give me a twirl,� I requested?

Ailsa stood up in front of her laptop (I had to improve the camera she was using) and showed me the very tight long tartan dress. The bodice looked very tight and the hood was up and hid Ailsa&#8217;s entire head, except her face.

�Do you like,� Ailsa asked Again?

�Of course,� I replied! �I&#8217;d prefer to see you wearing something less but I guess when we have guests, you need a uniform.�

Ailsa sat back down at her PC and told me that she had a uniform for me to wear. I tried to get more out her but Ailsa was staying tight lipped until I arrived in Eigg later today:

�How frustrated are you Dan,� quizzed Ailsa?

�The fucking chastity tube is driving me insane,� I came straight back at Ailsa on this topic that annoyed me!

�Well you&#8217;ll be free of it this afternoon,� Ailsa reassured me.

�I&#8217;m glad to hear that Ailsa,� I gladly replied. �I&#8217;m off to the airfield now to collect John so please don&#8217;t wear anything that will give him a heart attack?�

Ailsa just laughed and we ended the call before I switched off my desktop PC. I threw my bags in the car, picked up sixty litres of unleaded on route to the airfield where John Cameron, the CFI was waiting for me:

�Are you ready to go Dan,� asked John?

�Here&#8217;s my flight plan John,� I threw him the paper plan. �I&#8217;ve got to fuel up and check the plane so give me half-an-hour?�

With the aircraft fully fuelled and checked over, John jumped on board and we discussed the flight before I started up the engine and taxied out for take-off.

As we climbed out of the Glasgow zone John and I settled into what should be an uneventful flight to Eigg, just over 100 miles away:

�Your flying is improving Dan,� complemented John. 

�I&#8217;m glad you think so John,� I replied.

We chatted about what was needed for me to gain a license for a heavier aircraft but until I received the hours required, John and I set a hourly rate for him to fly the Caravan and any guests to Eigg. Within ninety minutes of leaving our airfield I was circling overhead Ailsa&#8217;s house and setting myself up to land:

�This is fantastic Dan,� said John as I eased the sport plane onto the black tarmac. �Let me guess there is a female involved?�

�And there she is,� I replied, pointing to Ailsa who was standing next to the open hanger.

�Fuck me mate,� replied John. �She&#8217;s hot! I can see why you&#8217;re so eager to get back up here!�

It was a bright day but not that warm in the north-western islands. Ailsa was wearing a short denim mini skirt over her normal black opaque tights and a black turtleneck shirt. The shirt was particularly tight and it made her tits stand out this morning. I parked the plane next to the hanger so that we could get the Caravan out before I popped my plane inside for the weekend. 

�Hello my darling,� I threw my arms around Ailsa and gave her a kiss, which was well received.

�This is John Cameron from the airfield and he will take your plane back for sale,� I introduced Ailsa to John.

Ailsa shook John&#8217;s hand and we discussed the circumstances to sell the Cessna Caravan. John had prepared some paperwork, which we&#8217;d go over during lunch but first we got the Caravan out of the hanger, popped mine in and began to check the much larger aircraft over before we headed in to sign the paperwork:

�Do you mind if we take it for a spin Ailsa,� asked John?

�Of course,� replied Ailsa. �Dan would you go with John and I&#8217;ll make us a light lunch before John heads home?�

That settled, I handed Ailsa my bags and John and I jumped into the Cessna after checking the fuel for quantity and water contamination. With it all checked we started up the Cessna and headed up in the late morning sky to see how the plane performed.

�This should sell quite quickly Dan,� John confidently assured me. �Do you want a cut of the sale?�
�Nah,� I replied. �Just sell the bloody thing, take your normal 5% and we&#8217;ll call it quits!�

�You really do like this girl,� John started to tease as we set the aircraft up for landing.

�She&#8217;s lovely John,� I replied. �I&#8217;m helping her set-up her home as a B&amp;B so I&#8217;m just happy to help Ailsa out and who knows what I&#8217;ll get in return?�

We both laughed as we shut down the Caravan and headed back to the house and kitchen where Ailsa was just setting the table for lunch:

�Great timing guys,� she announced as we all sat down to eat.

Lunch went on for an hour, where Ailsa signed the sales agreement for the Caravan and I walked John back to the waiting Cessna Caravan. As the aircraft headed into the afternoon sky, I walked back to the house and met Ailsa in the courtyard, wearing her uniform, the red tartan long dress, which now had a belt with a bunch of keys attached to a long chain and two pairs of handcuffs hanging on the other side:


Ailsa and Dan start another weekend:

I took hold of Ailsa again and placed my lips against hers:

�I see you&#8217;re prepared to accept a prisoner Ailsa,� I laughed taking hold of my now girlfriend and giving her a kiss she&#8217;d never forget.

It was then my cock started to grow again and the realisation that I was still locked in the belt, exactly where I&#8217;d been for the last week:

�Ailsa would you mind unlocking the fucking tube please,� I pleaded? �This is lovely but it&#8217;s killing me!�

�Come with me and we can see what we can do about it Dan,� Ailsa took my hand, leading into the outhouse and the interrogation room with the manacles hanging from the ceiling and the shackles attached to the floor.

The manacles were hanging lower than usual so Ailsa had no problems taking hold of my right wrist and locking into the heavy iron cuff. In saying that, I offered no resistance and soon both wrists were securely locked. Next Ailsa knelt down and locked both ankles into the shackles before walking over to the control panel on the wall and dragging the chain, the cuffs and of course my arms into the air, towards the ceiling:

�You offered no resistance darling,� teased Ailsa as she came straight back to me, kissing me once again.

�Why would I resist you,� I replied. �I&#8217;d do anything to get rid of the tube!�

Ailsa explained that she&#8217;d have to go back to the house and retrain the special keys from the safe:

�Don&#8217;t go anywhere,� announced Ailsa as she headed out of the room, closing and locking the door on route!

Where the fuck could I go? I was stretched with my ankles locked in the shackles and my hands were already getting sore in the manacles that held them high above my head. How long could I stand in this position? I had hoped Ailsa would simply go back to the house, retrieve the key and come straight back to release my cock. How wrong was I? I looked up at my watch and counted the minutes as they passed an hour before the door was unlocked and Ailsa came bounding into the room:

�I&#8217;m so sorry Dan,� she apologised coming over and kissing me. �We got our first booking!�

�When,� I asked?

�In three weeks,� replied Ailsa.

�That&#8217;s great honey but would you mind unlocking me,� I tried to turn the conversation back to my plight.

�Do you not want to hear the details,� asked Ailsa?

�Yes but please honey, unlock my dick,� I pleaded!

Ailsa just smiled and held up the special little key to my face:

�What&#8217;s it worth,� she teased?

�It&#8217;s your choice sweetheart,� I came straight back with a serious response. �If you don&#8217;t unlock my cock, I&#8217;ll be straight back on my plane this afternoon!�

�And how do you suppose you&#8217;re getting out of these shackles,� replied Ailsa?

I thought about my response a little longer than Ailsa or I had expected:

�I didn&#8217;t think so,� Ailsa broke the silence.

She then knelt down, pulled down the zip on my jeans, followed by the jeans and my boxers. 

�He looks so secure,� Ailsa continued to tease!

�That&#8217;s because he&#8217;s so locked up,� I sarcastically responded.

Ailsa then stood up without unlocking my cock and starred into my eyes:

�Don&#8217;t be so cheeky Dan,� Ailsa growled! �At the moment I own you so just remember that I therefore own your freedom!�

�And I am enjoying the control you have over me sweetheart,� I continued to beg for my cock&#8217;s freedom. �You&#8217;re just so hot but that causes me quite a lot of discomfort!�

Ailsa just smiled and placed her hands on either side of my face before kissing me again. I said nothing as Ailsa broke the kiss and knelt down to unlock my cock from the steel tube that had imprisoned him for nearly a week:

�Thank you Ailsa,� I whispered.

�I can see he&#8217;s happy to see me,� laughed Ailsa as my cock embarrassed me right away by rising to his new found freedom. 

�I think he is just delighted to be free,� I replied, delighted myself to be shot of the chastity tube.�

�Umm, what to do now,� asked Ailsa, putting her hand to her mouth in contemplation?

�You could free me from these chains and tell me all about our first guests,� I suggested!

�I could but I&#8217;m not going to,� replied Ailsa.

She was off again, this time leaving my trousers and boxers around my shackled ankles and my cock standing to attention for the first time in days. This time the door was left open so I guessed Ailsa was making the short trip to the storeroom so what was she up to? Ailsa was back in a few minutes with something hidden from view behind her back:

�I think it is payback time,� explained Ailsa who was now standing behind me. 

My arms were tight so I couldn&#8217;t turn around with my ankles locked to the floor. I soon knew my fate as Ailsa pulled the PVC hood over my head, the same PVC hood she&#8217;d worn last Sunday when I found her masturbating.

�No Ailsa, please no,� were my last words before the penis gag was forced into my mouth and my world went dark. 

Soon the hood was zipped up tight and I was breathing through the tube attached the penis gag that now filled my mouth. 

�Now this is how it&#8217;s going to work,� explained Ailsa! �I&#8217;m going to get you out of your cloths so any attempt to struggle will force me to close the valve on your gag.�

Ailsa then did something to the valve, which immediately meant I was sucking hard for air.

�You see,� Ailsa continued. �I&#8217;ve only given it a quarter of a turn and now you&#8217;re struggling to breathe!�

She was right; I was struggling to breathe so I stood still as Ailsa undid each ankle one-by-one before locking them again (one-by-one) and I was naked from the waist down. By lowering the manacles, Ailsa soon had me out of my T-shirt and therefore naked except for PCV hood that encased my entire head.

�Now that was easy, wasn&#8217;t it,� explained Ailsa as she gave the valve another turn and therefore cutting off all my air. �But sadly no fun so you&#8217;re going to experience what you put me through last Sunday!�

I started to panic as I could no longer breathe. I screamed into the gag but little noise came out! By now Ailsa had used the controls to pull my body tight. I was struggling to stay on my feet as my arms were pulled into the air. Soon Ailsa was sucking hard on my cock and it was wonderful. She was right, this was a rush but never-the-less I was being starved of oxygen as I exploded in Ailsa&#8217;s mouth in seconds!

�Did you enjoy that,� asked Ailsa as she stood up and turned the valve, allowing me to breathe again?

All I could do was nod and MUMPTH into the gag.

�I&#8217;m off to get a drink,� laughed Ailsa, leaving me to hang in the chains I&#8217;d spent the last couple of hours in.�

I heard the door being closed and locked but other than that I heard very little and saw nothing! How long would Ailsa leave me this time? My arms ached and being stretched even tighter this time, I was struggling to keep my wits. However I didn&#8217;t have to wait long until the door was being unlocked and Ailsa returning. However was it Ailsa because I could see nothing and hear very little as the motor brought the manacles down so that they could be unlocked? I was disorientated as both hands came free. I should have brought both up to grab the mask but I didn&#8217;t, instead allowing whoever was in control to pull both arms behind my back and lock them into a pair of handcuffs. My ankles were next but at least they remained free as Ailsa finally spoke:

�Follow me,� she said in a relaxed tone as I was led out of the interrogation suite. 

I hoped to turn left and back towards the house but not this time as I felt Ailsa tug mew to the right. I MUMPTHED into my gag but little came out and past the gag that filed me mouth. It was then we stopped:

�You&#8217;re uniform is lying on the bed,� explained Ailsa. �When I remove your cuffs, you can unzip and remove the hood yourself but please get dressed?�

I could feel Ailsa fiddling with my handcuffs, which were soon gone but then the sound of a cell door closing behind me, told me that I was probably locked in one of the prison cells. I reached for the rear zip on the hood and soon as I was free of the heavy PVC. I was spot-on; I was now locked in the cell I spent last Saturday night in and lying on the bunk was a pile of clothes, including a kilt. Now I&#8217;d worn a kilt to many formal occasions so this would be no hardship or would it be? As I checked out what else Ailsa was expecting me to wear as my new uniform, I would a pair of black leather DM boots on the floor beside the bunk and a linen long sleeved cream shirt. Next I found what I thought were cream woollen socks but as I picked them up, I realised that these were thick cream woollen tights. I guess this was Ailsa&#8217;s kinkier side kicking in! No sign of any boxers or pants so I pulled on the luxurious wool tights followed by the linen shirt. Next came the black, green and cream tartan kilt and finally the leather boots or so I thought). It was then I noticed another item of clothing so I picked it up to find a thick black woollen balaclava. As I pulled the heavy wool over my head I managed to find the mouth and two eye holes but this balaclava was long and I had to fiddle with the long neck until it was fitting comfortably around my neck. I then checked myself in the mirror and saw Ailsa&#8217;s kinky idea of a uniform for me. It looked great and felt great but how long would I last in the heavy wool during the summer? I&#8217;d no idea what to do now. I was horny but knew that taking things into my own hand meant pulling down the wonderfully soft women tights so to ensure self-restraint, I backed up to the wall and slipped each wrist into the open manacles. With a little difficulty, I soon had them closed and locked! I didn&#8217;t have to wait long this time until Ailsa returned:

�Ummm, you look so good it that uniform,� she complemented my new uniform as the cell door opened. �And you&#8217;ve even managed to lock yourself into the manacles!�

�I had to do some self-restraint honey,� I replied. �I&#8217;m glad you like this uniform because so do I, even though I&#8217;m not sure I&#8217;ll survive in the summer under all this wool!�

Ailsa then approached and we kissed:

�I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ll survive Dan,� explained Ailsa. �My plan is that none of our guests will ever see your face!�

�That&#8217;s a novel approach,� I replied. �However I do see some logic in your madness.�

�But then Dan,� Ailsa continued, �I do like a man in a skirt and a mask!�

�I know you do,� I laughed!

We kissed again before Ailsa sat back on the bunk:

�So our first guests,� she opened the conversation.

�Yes, tell me about our first guests,� I replied, still manacled to the wall of the small cell.

�Their German,� replied Ailsa. �Two girls, Nicole and Heidi from Cologne: They&#8217;re walking the West Highland Way and will arrange to catch a ferry to Eigg in three weeks on Saturday.�

�Did they talk about their requirements,� I continued questioning?

�No darling,� replied Ailsa. �I&#8217;ve e-mailed the guest requirements form you and I prepared last week so I expect we&#8217;ll find out very soon.�

Ailsa then got up, took the keys from her long chain attached to her belt and unlocked my wrists before we kissed again:

�I think it is time to take some video Dan,� Ailsa set out her plan for the rest of the afternoon. �Let&#8217;s go back to the house so that I can get changed into something much more seductive and you can prepare the camera.�

Back at the house I remained in my new uniform, including the wool balaclava. With my digital SLR and HD camcorder, I headed back to the outhouse, taking some pictures on route.&nbsp; After setting up the camcorder in the room Ailsa had chained me in earlier, I set-up the SLR on a tripod and went back outside to take some video of the entrance to the play rooms. I had just stopped videoing when am image I&#8217;ll never forget exited the back door of the house:

�Nice outfit,� I laughed and wolf-whistled at Ailsa who was dressed in a black Lycra cat suit.&nbsp; 

�Do you like,� Ailsa kept fishing for more complements?

�Of course I do, I continued to pay this beautiful girl some more complements.

Ailsa&#8217;s body was completely covered from head to toe in bright shiny black Lycra. The built in hood had both eyes and a mouth hole, not that different to my balaclava. I then set-up the video camera to take a shot of me escorting Ailsa to the outhouse:

�Before we start honey, I think you need to be restrained,� I set the scene.

�I agree,� replied Ailsa. �I&#8217;ll head into the store room and pick up so essentials.�

Ailsa was back in a few seconds with a prison set in her hands. I then knelt down and shackled her ankles before taking her arms and pulling them behind her back and locking Ailsa&#8217;s wrists into the cuffs. For the next two hours I videoed the Lycra covered Ailsa in every room, using every device and then in the cells with various restraints to the cage. 

�Last one Ailsa,� I teased. �Time to get you into a straightjacket!�

As we headed back to the storeroom, Ailsa replaced the prison set while I picked up a white canvas jacket:

�I think this will contrast with your back cat suit perfectly,� I laughed holding up the heavy canvas straight jacket!

Ailsa offered no resistance as I slipped her arms into the long sleeves, turned her around and started pulling on the various straps and buckles very tightly:

�You&#8217;re enjoying this Dan,� laughed Ailsa as I started the process of feeding her arms through the front chest loop?

�You bet,� I replied as I hauled on each sleeve to ensure it was going to be very, very tight. 

Before buckling the crotch strap I tightened the chest loop to ensure Ailsa&#8217;s arms were not coming over her head. I had plans to keep her in the jacket a little longer than she was expecting so I wanted to ensure escape was never an option. The crotch strap came last and then I led my little mad girl to the padded cell where I began the session be taking about one hundred digital stills. Next I set-up the video camera and videoed Ailsa struggling to free herself from the jacket, which of course was never going to happen:

�Are you enjoying yourself Ailsa,� I teased, putting down the camera to give my little bound vixen a kiss. 

�Oh this feels so good,� responded Ailsa in a low seductive voice. �I&#8217;ve never felt this tight before, I love it!�

�Well sweetheart, you&#8217;ll then enjoy staying in here a wee while longer while I download the pictures and videos into my laptop,� I dropped my plan, heading out of the padded cell.

�Oh Dan, don&#8217;t leave me in here,� pleaded Ailsa as I slammed the padded door closed.

I ignored Ailsa&#8217;s pleas as I took the camera gear and headed back to the house. Removing the balaclava, I set-up my laptop on the kitchen table and began downloading the images and video. To be honest, I lost track of time until I noticed it was eight o&#8217;clock and Ailsa had therefore spent over two-and-a-half hours in the padded cell. I rushed over to find her sitting on the floor in a state of exhaustion:

�I&#8217;m so sorry honey, I forgot all about you,� I laughed as I help Ailsa to her feet.

�I&#8217;ll remember that, the next time I put you in a straightjacket and leave you in here for three hours,� grunted Ailsa!

�Two-and-a-half hours,� I sarcastically responded. �Anyway, you seemed so happy to be in the jacket!�

�Since you&#8217;re being so grumpy you can stay in here a little longer,� I laughed, pushing Ailsa back into the padded cell and slamming the door closed!

I headed back over to the house to make us both some dinner. Some simple pasta and a bottle of wine were taken over to the canteen area of the outhouse before I used the keys to lock the last set of barred doors. Ailsa was staying in here a lot longer than she would ever expect so after removing a really grumpy Ailsa from the padded cell, I led her to the canteen where she remained in the jacket while I fed her.

�You&#8217;re really enjoying yourself Dan arn&#8217;t you,� asked Ailsa between mouthfuls?
�Well if I&#8217;m to finish our website this weekend I&#8217;m going to need some peace and quiet,� I replied pushing another mouthful of pasta into Ailsa&#8217;s mouth.

�You&#8217;re not keeping me in here all weekend,� Ailsa started to panic?

I just stared back at her and smiled:

�You&#8217;ll stay in here as long as I want you to be here,� I teased.

It was then Ailsa stood up and tried to get away from me. If I didn&#8217;t know any better, she wanted to be chased! As you can imagine, I caught her easily and soon had her popped into the first cell we both spent a night in last week:

�You&#8217;re not going to leave me in the straightjacket Dan,� Ailsa really started to get concerned?

�If I let you out of it, will you fight me,� I tried to gauge Ailsa&#8217;s mood?

�No I promise to be good,� responded Ailsa.

�Okay then, kneel on the floor with your face towards the wall,� I demanded?

With Ailsa on the floor, I soon had her out of the jacket but before she could rush me, I was out of the cell and closed the door.

Back at the house, I continued working on the website until midnight. I was tired so before going to bed myself, I headed back to check on Ailsa with a glass of water and a cup of tea. As I opened the latch I could see my little friend was fast asleep. She was still wearing the cat suit and her face was still covered by its&#8217; built in mask. I decided not to wake sleeping beauty and headed back to the house to get into bed myself.


Another Saturday and more web development:

Before any of you ask, I was really boring on Friday night. I simply removed my kilt, shirt and of course those think woollen tights and climbed into bed naked. I guess Ailsa would be disappointed but to be honest, she would be none the wiser as I fell to sleep on my first night back on Eigg.

Saturday morning came far too quickly so at around nine o&#8217;clock I was up and about, having had my shower and slipped back into my own cloths. Breakfast prepared I headed across to the outhouse and after unlocking and re-locking several barred gates, I soon arrived at Ailsa&#8217;s cell:

�I wondered when you&#8217;d come back for me,� complained Ailsa as I opened her cell door.

She was still wearing her black cat suit but the built in mask was now bunched up around her neck. Her hair looked a mess but she was still a really attractive girl!

�I brought you a cup of tea at mid-night but you were fast asleep,� I replied, trying to dig myself out of the hole that I was certainly in right now. �Anyway, here is your breakfast.�

Ailsa took hold of the tray and placed it on the small table in her cell.

�Are you not going to join me,� she asked?

�Nope,� I replied. �I&#8217;ve a lot of work to do on the website today so I think you&#8217;ll be safe in here today!�

Ailsa then turned to face me:

�You&#8217;re not going to leave me in here all day are you,� she started to panic?

I just smiled as I stood in the open doorway of Ailsa&#8217;s cell.

�I&#8217;m going to leave the cell door open Ailsa,� I explained. �You&#8217;ll therefore have access to the shower and I&#8217;ll bring you some clothes to wear but for now, you&#8217;re my prisoner and I&#8217;m enjoying keeping you under lock and key!�

Ailsa then approached and gave me a kiss. As our tongues met, she pulled back:

�Are you sure you want to leave me in here today,� she teased?

�Yes,� I replied and then as I gone, closing and locking the next set of bars, which meant Ailsa had no route to leave the tiny cell block.

Back at the house, I headed to Ailsa&#8217;s bedroom and her massive walk-in closet. I&#8217;d no wish for my girl to be in jeans or trousers but she owned very few pairs. Ailsa&#8217;s cloths collection was generally made up of skirts, dresses, blouses and sweaters. After some deliberation, I found some uniforms so I thought the black satin French maids outfit would best serve my purpose today. Turning to the drawers for a white bra, pants and a pair of cream opaque tights, I was soon ready to return to Ailsa but only after I picked out a pair of black leather strapped shoes with an enormous heel. These shoes had tiny locks, just like the pair Ailsa had previously forced me to wear so soon I was back in the outhouse, leaving the cloths just the other side of the barred gate, where Ailsa could easily retrieve them. I then headed back to boot my PC and start back into the website but less than an hour into my work and watching endless video of yesterday&#8217;s escapades and countless digital pictures, I was extremely honey so I had to check on my prisoner. As I entered the outhouse, I went into the storeroom to pick out a few more toys to add to Ailsa&#8217;s Saturday in my custody. A couple of things interested me but my decision turned to three spheres (2 small and 1 large). I knew from my time on the internet that the small spheres would lock around your hand, which would be forced into a fist. The larger sphere would fit over the victims head and leave them bind and locked in a form of iron mask. I lifted these items and headed back to the set of bars and stop Ailsa from exiting the cell block:

�Are you there Ailsa,� I called out?

�I&#8217;m in here,� she shouted from the first cell, the same cell she&#8217;d spent all night in.

�Can you come out here,� I called back?

�Not possible,� responded Ailsa. �I&#8217;m a little tied up right now!�

I guess she&#8217;d done what I did yesterday and fancied some time in manacles, attached to the cell wall.

�Are you surprised to see me like this,� asked Ailsa as I entered the tiny cell?

�I guess not,� I replied, popping the three spheres in the bunk.

�You&#8217;re not putting those on me are you,� asked Ailsa?

�Yes I am,� I replied. �And you&#8217;ve made it even easier for me!�

Ailsa had no option but to allow me to slip each sphere over her wrists, forcing her hands into a fist, now locked securely within the iron balls.

�This looks a bit severe,� I commented, picking up the larger sphere.

I placed it over my head and held it closed, ensuring he lock didn&#8217;t engage.

�Go on Dan,� teased Ailsa. �I dare you to close it!�

�Not a chance Ailsa,� I laughed, taking the iron sphere off my head and holding it to hers. �What is the longest you&#8217;ve spent in this thing?�

�It is very claustrophobic in that helmet,� responded Ailsa. �I think the most I&#8217;ve managed is an hour.�

�Oh well,� I laughed! �It&#8217;s eleven o&#8217;clock now so I&#8217;ll let you out at one to make us both some lunch like a good little maid should.�

�You&#8217;re a cruel master,� complained Ailsa as I closed and locked the iron sphere around her head.

I then slipped my hand under the hem of her dress and felt for her most private place, which was getting a little wet.

�I know you&#8217;re okay with this,� I continued to laugh before exiting the cell, closing and locking the door.

Back in the house I continued with the website until I had it is reasonable shape. It was then I noticed it was now after two o&#8217;clock and Ailsa would be really pissed with me (again). I got up and shot across to the cell where Ailsa was still standing, manacled to the wall with her head and hands still in the iron spheres.

�Is that you Dan,� came Ailsa&#8217;s voice from behind the sphere?

�Who else can it be,� sweetheart,� I replied as I unlocked and removed the large iron sphere from Ailsa&#8217;s head.

�What time is it,� asked Ailsa?

�I&#8217;m s sorry darling,� I replied. �It&#8217;s just after two. I was so engrossed in the website that I forgot about you. It&#8217;s just about finished so I promise you that I&#8217;ll do whatever you want to do this afternoon.�

Ailsa threw hers arms around me and kissed me on the lips as I freed her from the wall-mounted manacles. I then held each wrist and removed the smaller spheres, throwing them onto the bunk:

�You may live to regret offering me that Dan,� responded Ailsa, forcing herself in for another long and passionate kiss.

�Whatever,� I brushed off Ailsa&#8217;s comments. �Let&#8217;s go over and prepare some lunch and then I can show you the website.�

We walked back to the main house and the kitchen hand in hand. We prepared lunch and then sat together, free form any bondage and ate. I have to admit that Ailsa looked great in her French maids outfit and she knew it was driving me nuts, especially when she rubbed her white Lycra clad leg against mine:

�How about you put away the dishes and I go upstairs and find something more appropriate for you to wear this afternoon Dan,� requested Ailsa who clearly had revenge in mind.

�OK,� I replied. �What do you fancy doing all afternoon?

Ailsa just put her arms around me a whispered:

�Dan darling, I&#8217;m going to test my new website to destruction,� explained Ailsa. �I want peace and quiet to do it so you&#8217;re spending this afternoon in the cage. If I like the website, you&#8217;ll get out for dinner and we can sleep together tonight but if I don&#8217;t like it, you&#8217;ll be eating dinner through a straw and staying in the cage until tomorrow!�

Now that sounded like a threat if you asked me but I had put Ailsa through a lot since yesterday afternoon so I guess it was her time to have some fun at my expense. As finished packing the dishwasher, Ailsa called me up to the pare room:

�Put these on,� she demanded, throwing me a pair of very unsexy (black) pants and a black bra. 

The pants held everything in and the bra held a pair of massive silicon breast forms. Next I was handed a pair of very thick wool tights, not that different to the pair I wore yesterday but this pair were black. Next item to come out of the wardrobe was a massive sweater dress, made from the thick navy-blue wool. As I pulled it over my head, the dress clung to my body and needed to be pulled into place around my ankles. The sleeves were long and required to be rolled back on themselves to avoid covering my hands. The neck of the dress was the same! I had to roll it several times to avoid covering my entire head but Ailsa soon gave me something for that! She handed me the same thick black wool balaclava I wore yesterday and after some tugging, it was fitted under the collar of the dress.

�You&#8217;ve never worn boots before Dan so now is a good time to find out what they&#8217;re like,� laughed Ailsa as she threw me a pair of high heeled black leather boots.

I then sat on the bed and pulled o each boot.

�I&#8217;ll never be able to walk in these,� I complained, standing up and hobbling toward Ailsa who was still in her French maids outfit.

�You&#8217;ll not need to walk far Dan, promise,� responded Ailsa as she took me by the hand and led me back across the outhouse.

We first visited the storeroom and Ailsa picked out he heavy prison set I&#8217;d worn briefly last weekend. These cuffs and leg-irons were old and very heavy but attached to each other by a long and very heavy chain, my ankles were soon hobbled and my arms held tightly behind my back. As I followed Ailsa towards the cells I struggled to keep up in the high heeled boots and now the chains that restricted my movement even more. Standing outside the cell Ailsa had spent all night and morning in, I was soon being subjected to the hand spheres, which forced each of my hands into as tight fist. Ailsa then picked up the head sphere and I followed her into the cell with the cage:

�On your knees slave,� She called out!

�OK mistress,� I laughed in reply!

Once on my knees Ailsa fitted the heavy iron sphere around my head. It was a very tight fit to begin with but now I had a thick wool balaclava around my head, the iron sphere was even tighter!

�In you go slave,� Ailsa kept up the game as she basically shoved me into the cage, causing me to fall on my face or should I say the iron sphere helmet.

I then heard the cage door being slammed closed:

�Right Dan,� explained Ailsa. �It&#8217;s now three-thirty. You left me in those spheres for three hours so I&#8217;m leaving you in them for three hours as well. If the website is up to scratch I&#8217;ll let you out at six-thirty but if it&#8217;s pants, you&#8217;ll be let out of the cage for a piss and then locked into a cell for the rest of the night and tomorrow you can fix the website!�

That was all I heard as Ailsa slammed the cell door closed, leaving me to sweat in my wool outfit, locked in the cage.

As you can imagine, I was hot, very hot! The fact I was practically covered head to toe in thick wool was the largest part of my problem right now. The other fact that I was chained hand and foot with heavy iron spheres covering my head and both hands meant this was going to be a very uncomfortable three hours. I guess that I resolved myself to sit down, relax and accept this pay-back because I had deserved it. I had kept Ailsa my prisoner for nearly 24 hours and the last three in a straightjacket so this was penance for my behaviour. Don&#8217;t get me wrong, I was enjoying my bondage very much but I hoped Ailsa would love my website enough to let me out in three hours&#8217; time. In saying that, how long had I now spent in here and therefore how long did I have left, covered head to toe in wool, manacled and shackled with the added discomfort of the iron spheres. 

I served my time slowly that afternoon and at some point during the early evening (I think) I heard the cell door being unlocked:

�Is that you Ailsa,� I called out?

�Who else would it be Dan,� came that sweet island voice I was falling in love with.

�How do you like the website,� I replied, trying to change the subject and trying to determine my fate this afternoon?

Ailsa didn&#8217;t reply as the cage door opened and I could feel her sliding in beside me. I then felt the sphere being unlocked from my head and as soon as the heavy iron had been lifted free I could see Ailsa was still wearing her French Maids outfit. She came straight in and kissed me through the open mouth of the wool balaclava:

�The website is fantastic honey, I love it,� Ailsa finally broke the silence.

�I&#8217;m so glad you like it,� I responded, taking a large breathe, relieved that I&#8217;d soon be free.

Ailsa then bent over in the small cage to unlock my ankle cuffs before turning me around so that she could reach the handcuffs.

�What about these,� I asked as I held up both hands, referring to the sphere still locked around my wrists? 

�I suppose so,� replied Ailsa using the special key to unlock the hand spheres. �Please keep the mask on but or I&#8217;ll have to handcuff you again.�

�Okay,� I replied, moving in for another kiss, which was accepted and reciprocated.

When we finally broke up, Ailsa and I gathered the various toys and headed back to the main house after placing them all back in the store. Dinner was fantastic and we sat for hours, drinking wine and enjoying each other&#8217;s company while listening to music. I remained in the heavy wool dress all evening but was allowed to remove the thick balaclava just before dinner. An hour or so after diner, Ailsa insisted I put it back on, which to be honest was expected knowing her love of hoods and mask and quite frankly, I was happy to accept based upon my own kinky nature.

We finally fell into bed around eleven and we were due to spend our first full night in bed as lovers. After getting naked and making love until well past mid-night, Ailsa insisted that I joined her wearing a long nightdress and tights to sleep in. I was only now really beginning to understand this girls&#8217; appetite for kinky wear. Never-the-less, I slept well that night and wondered what Sunday would bring.


Sunday and a brand new day!

I was woken sometime after nine by Ailsa falling out of bed:

�What are you doing honey,� I asked?

�Just trying to open my bed-side drawer without getting out of bed,� replied Ailsa.

�Well you did a piss poor job at that,� I laughed in response. �What were trying to get?�

�These,� replied a dissevered Ailsa, climbing back into bed, holding a pair of standard handcuffs.

�What are those for,� I teased?

�To have fun with you,� responded Ailsa, taking hold of my left wrist and closing the cuff around it. �Now put your arms behind your back!�

�What if I refuse,� I continued teasing?

�Why would you want to refuse a girl like me,� Ailsa started joining in, lower her head and fluttering her eye&#8217;s?

How could I resist and I allowed Ailsa to lock my arms behind my back.

�What now,� I asked hopeful for some fun?

�I&#8217;m going for a shower,� responded Ailsa, getting up from the bed.

�Hey that&#8217;s not fair,� I shouted!

Ailsa started undressing in front of me. First came off her nightshirt, followed by her black tights and then her silk panties. I sort of knew what was coming next as she picked up her pants and tights and approached the bed again:

�Come on honey, open up,� requested Ailsa in a low sexy voice.

I kept my mouth closed; trying to avoid her stuffing the pants she&#8217;d worn all day yesterday into my mouth.

�Oh come on Dan, you know you want to,� Ailsa continued teasing taking of and then pinching my nose.

It was no use, I couldn&#8217;t hold my breath so as soon as I opened my mouth to take in air, the back silk panties were stuffed into my mouth, followed by the body part of her tights. The legs of her tights were then tightly wrapped around my head and tied of, holding the packing inside my stuffed mouth.

�Enjoy,� laughed Ailsa who now skipped towards the ensuite and a long hot shower. 

From the bedside clock, I could see Ailsa has spent forty minutes in the shower, doing whatever she did. Finally she emerged with a towel wrapped around her body and another towel wrapped around her hair. Sitting on the chair at her dressing table, Ailsa spent another half hour drying her hair and applying make-up before retrieving a bright red matching bra and panty set from the dressing table drawers. From the mirror, Ailsa could clearly see me staring at her as she got dressed. I could also clearly see myself staring at Ailsa, a man in a blue nightdress with his arms pinned behind his back and a pair of black Lycra tights gagging him.

�Red for danger today, don&#8217;t you think,� Ailsa finally broke the silence, standing up and turning towards me?

All I could do was MUMPTH into my gag and nod in agreement.

�I&#8217;m glad you agree with me sweetheart,� replied Ailsa now fishing for something else in another drawer. �I think these will do perfectly,� she continued teasing me, holding up a pair of bright red Lycra tights which she sat on the bed beside me to put on.�

Getting up and doing a twirl in front of me, Ailsa then headed into the massive work-in closet to pick out her Sunday outfit. She emerged only a few minutes later wearing a zebra print, black and white summer dress with a pair of high heeled shoes with a massive leather strap holding them on around her ankles.

�Do you like,� teased Ailsa again, giving me another twirl?

Again, I nodded vigorously and MUMPTHED into my gag.

�Don&#8217;t go away,� Ailsa then asked, heading out of the bedroom. �I&#8217;ll be back in a few seconds with something for you to wear!�

Where could I go? My hands were cuffed and my mouth packed with her pants and tights! I manoeuvred myself towards the side of the bed where Ailsa picked up the cuffs from a drawer in her bedside cabinet. As luck may have it, the drawer was still open and lying on top of some other interesting toys; I saw a bunch of keys which I knew would unlock my wrists. I had to get them so easing myself off the bed I was soon fiddling around with my arms cuffed behind my back to grab hold of the keys, which were lodged among some silk scarves and a vibrator. Grabbing hold of a scarf (ascendency) and the keys, I climbed back on the bed.

�What are you doing, shouted Ailsa, coming back into the bedroom with a pile of cloths in her arms?

I MUMPTHED into my gag but Ailsa quickly came around, grabbing the contents of my bound hands.

�Right I&#8217;ve found you nice outfit to wear today so as soon as you&#8217;ve freed yourself, take a shower and get dressed. I&#8217;m doing out from some rolls and will be back in thirty minutes,� explained Ailsa.�

She then stood back with the keys and silk scarf in her hand and smiled. 

�To make this interesting,� she laughed, approaching with the scarf, �I think I&#8217;ll blindfold you!�

With that Ailsa took the large multi-coloured triangle of silk and folded into a thick band before placing it over my eyes and tying it off behind my head.

�Right mister,� she continued. �The keys are on the bed. All you have to do is find them, release your hands, get naked and have a shower. When I come back I want you dressed and please use the scarf to cover your head Grace-Kelly style, I&#8217;m sure you can work it out!�

With those instructions, Ailsa was gone and I had the job of finding the keys before I could do anything else: My first thought was to dislodge the scarf blindfolding me but it was tight, very tight! I eased my head towards the frame of Ailsa&#8217;s king-size bed and tried my best to push the scarf off my face. It wouldn&#8217;t budge! The silk was smooth and obviously very expensive so I therefore had little option but to turn around and feel for the keys with my cuffed hands but that was easier said than done! 

I thought I had an idea where Ailsa had dropped the keys but they simply weren&#8217;t there. I was breathing heavily by now and this meant the silk panties got even wetter than they already were before Ailsa had stuffed them in my mouth. It was then I understood that that silk is very hard to breathe through when wet! I had to try and breathe through my nose but that was tough because Ailsa had folded the silk scarf into a very wide band that also covered my nose, making my work even harder! I simply couldn&#8217;t find the keys but then I brain-eave; had Ailsa left them on the bed-side cabinet when she picked-up the scarf? I had to find out by manoeuvring myself towards the edge of the bed and reversing towards the bedside cabinet, I fumbled with my fingers until finally I found the keys. &#8216;YEAH&#8217; I thought to myself, grabbing the large bunch and feeling for the key that would unlock my S&amp;W handcuffs. I had a lot of experience at home during self-bondage because I knew that the Yuil key was different from the key that fitted Hiatt or S&amp;W cuffs. Finally I was there and after feeling where the key-holes were I soon had the first cuff free! Pulling the scarf from my face (now lying bundled around my neck), I unlocked the second and therefore, last cuff. All I had to do was plug the tights from my mouth, removing the silk pants from my mouth and then I could get undressed and take a well-earned shower.

Boy was it a nice shower! Soon as I drying myself off and heading out to the bedroom to see what Ailsa had left me to wear today. I knew I&#8217;d be cross dressing today but what had Ailsa picked out for me today? Umm, this was different! First all there was the usual black bra and pants. She&#8217;d also left me two large silicon breasts to slip between the padded bra and my flat chest. That done I move into a pair of thick Lycra green tights; yes green tights! Ailsa was certainly in a colourful mood today but she did say to me last weekend that she liked more colour on a Sunday. Next came a thin black stretchy bodysuit with a built in bodice and poppers. I pulled this on over my torso and then I pushed home the three poppers over my green covered crotch. Over this, Ailsa had provided a loose grey summer-dress. I easily pulled this over my head and down my now smooth body. I then had to negotiate the shoes Ailsa had left for me. They were black with a heel that was much higher than I would have hoped for and a thick strap to secure the shoes to my ankles, not that different from the shoes Ailsa was wearing today. I was done but as I turned to the pile of cloths I discarded this morning, I remembered the green silk scarf that Ailsa had asked me to wear Grace-Kelly style this morning. Opening out he triangle (yes I&#8217;d done this before) I placed the scarf over my head and pulled the end tight until I could wrapped them under my chin, tying them off behind my neck. I was now done! Looking in the mirror I saw a slightly large female staring back with a man&#8217;s face. Not the most attractive look to me but never-the-less I expected Ailsa would be happy.

It was then I heard her voice as she entered the bedroom:

�I see you freed yourself,� laughed Ailsa. �I love the outfit!�

�I thought you might,� I laughed in response! �I feel ridiculous but I suppose it is only you and I in this big house so what the hell,� I shrugged my shoulders. 

Ailsa approached gave me a kiss:

�I love the fact you&#8217;ll dress like this for me,� she praised, kissing my again, forcing her tongue deep into my mouth.

�I&#8217;m glad you understand that I&#8217;m only doing this for you Ailsa,� I ensured she understand this wasn&#8217;t a lifestyle for me beyond this house? If you are happy with the website, I&#8217;d like to upload it today and get it live before we head to the mainland tomorrow.�

�How long will that take,� asked Ailsa?

�I just need five minutes to prepare the upload but as soon as I send the file on its&#8217; way, I just need to sit back and check things are fine in a couple of hours,� I explained.

�That&#8217;s perfect Dan,� responded Ailsa. �I&#8217;ll make us some brunch and you prepare the upload. As soon as we&#8217;re finished eating I like you to experience the gibbet.� 

Ailsa was right, I&#8217;d not had any first-hand experience of the gibbet but I thought there was no way I&#8217;d fit in it but of course, I was willing to give it a go! As Ailsa prepared food, I started the process that would take over two hours to upload the new website to the Cloud and make set us on our way to a profitable alternative B&amp;B.

�Right, that the website started,� I opened the conversation as I entered the large kitchen to see my girl where she did her best work!

We ate breakfast and enjoyed each other&#8217;s company. It was during these times that I forgot all about the way I was dressed and accepted myself for the situation I was in.

�Right let&#8217;s take you over and get you settled into some bondage and then I&#8217;ll come back and clear up,� explained Ailsa.

With that she stood up, took me by the hand and led my out of the kitchen, across the courtyard to the out-building that housed the really fun stuff.

�Are you sure I&#8217;ll fit in there Ailsa,� I acted sort of concerned where I was about to be locked into?

�We&#8217;ll find out in a minute,� replied Ailsa as she opened the gibbet and directed me to stand inside with my back to the wall.

Ailsa then started to close the front portion of the gibbet frame. It was tight but with a little push and a CLICK, I knew the front piece had engaged with the lock and I was going nowhere.

�How long am I to be stuck in here,� I asked?

�Until I let you out sweetie,� responded Ailsa as she exited the room, closing and locking the outer door.

I was going nowhere! My body was tightly squeezed into an iron frame. My arms were pinned to my sides and my head was held tight in the frame that would not be released until Ailsa returned! I was honey in seconds and the fact I was wearing the grey dress over the black thin bodysuit and green tights, the high heeled shoes and the green silk scarf tied Grace-Kelly style around my head, I was bound in an iron gibbet, which was also secured inside a locked cell. I was therefore going nowhere and unable to do anything about my aroused state so I had zero options open to me, except to stand here and accept my situation. Standing, now that was also a chore! My feet were killing me in these high heels! I&#8217;ve no idea how girls wear them? They&#8217;re bloody awful and I can fully appreciate why men never had to deal with such torture!

By the time the outer cell door opened I was in pain, terrible pain:

�Thank goodness you&#8217;re back,� I immediately broke the silence!

�Why did you miss me sweetie,� teased Ailsa as she came up to the gibbet and pushed her fingers through the bars at my crotch area. �I see you are glad to see me though.�

�Ailsa my feet are killing me honey, can you please let me out of this thing,� I pleaded?

�What&#8217;s it worth,� Ailsa continued to tease?

�Anything to get out of these fucking shoes,� I started to get a little ratty!


�Now, now Dan,� Ailsa kept up her front. �There is no need to get grumpy with me. All I wanted to know is what you would do for me if I released you from the gibbet and allowed you to take off your shoes.�

�Darling, I&#8217;m sorry,� I calmed down. �These shoes are torture and I just want out of them so you name it and I&#8217;ll do it.�

Ailsa stood back and held the keys in her right hand:

�Okay Dan, here&#8217;s the deal,� Ailsa began to set-out her opening deal. �I will let you out of the gibbet and I&#8217;ll allow you to take off the shoes. I&#8217;ll even allow you to take off the dress but I want you in a white canvas straightjacket for the rest of the day and locked in the padded cell!�

I just stared back at Ailsa through the iron frame of the gibbet:

�Okay Ailsa but only after you give me half an hour to check the website upload process,� I set-out my side of the negotiations.

�That seems reasonable Dan,� replied Ailsa, placing the large key into the gibbet lock and turning it.

The pressure on my body immediately subsided and I fell out of the gibbet into the open cell and Ailsa&#8217;s arms.

�Hey honey, we haven&#8217;t used that yet,� I tried my luck, pointing at the Saint Andrew&#8217;s cross.

�Neither we have,� responded Ailsa, �Would you like to try it?�

�I was thinking more that I&#8217;d like to attach you to it while I check on the website,� I continued chancing my arm!

Ailsa stood back and thought about it for a minute:

�Do you promise to release me as soon as you&#8217;ve checked the website,� she tested my motive?

�Of course honey,� I replied, trying to hold back a smile.

�Okay then,� Ailsa handed me the keys and manoeuvred herself towards the Saint Andrew&#8217;s cross and the leather buckles.

With Ailsa now with her back to the Mahogany cross, I slowly attached each padded leather strap around both her wrists and tightened them as best I could. Kissing her on the mouth and kneeling down, I did the same with Ailsa&#8217;s ankles.

�Are you sure you can&#8217;t free yourself from this sweetheart,� I asked, standing up to face my pretty little friend who&#8217;s arms and legs were spread to form the shape of the cross she was buckled to?

�There is no way to reach the buckles,� replied Ailsa. �Peter had me attached to this for four hours one day and I fought hard to free myself with no success.�

�That&#8217;s perfect,� I replied. �I&#8217;ll be back as soon as I&#8217;ve checked the website and made us a light lunch, is that okay?�

�Just don&#8217;t be long,� Ailsa pleaded as I exited the cell, closing and locking the heavy door behind me.

As soon as I made it back to the house, I had to get rid of these fucking shoes. I went straight to the spare bedroom and sat on the bed. Soon they were gone but I had to replace them with something so a pair of low-heeled slip-on pumps were the perfect solution. The website had finished uploading twenty minutes earlier and after another thirty minutes of testing, I was back in the kitchen making Ailsa and I a light lunch. As soon as it was prepared, I went back to unbuckle Ailsa from the cross and we headed back to the kitchen to eat. This meant for the next hour it was like two girlfriends in dresses having some time together over Sunday lunch.

�So are you ready to be jacketed Dan,� Ailsa suddenly changed the subject?

�That sounds like fun sweetie,� I laughed in response.

Ailsa agreed to put away the remnants of lunch after locking me up for a few hours frustration so we headed over to the outhouse and the storeroom:

�Can I try the white canvas jacket Ailsa,� I asked?

�That&#8217;s exactly what I was thinking,� replied Ailsa as she pulled a white canvas jacket off the hanger. �I suggest you take off your dress Dan but leave everything else on, including the head scarf!�

Ailsa then held the jacket open as I pulled the dress over my head and stood in front of her wearing the thin bodysuit, green tights and the green silk headscarf. I must have look hideous as I held out both arms to receive the heavy canvas jacket.

�This feel heavy,� I commented as Ailsa let go of the jacket as soon as my arms held it in place.

�You&#8217;ll love this one Dan,� Ailsa responded as she started to buckle the jacket closed from behind.

I could already feel how tight this was going to be! Ailsa pulled the three rear buckles as tight as she could:

�Okay dearest,� Ailsa then gave me the next instruction. �Fold your arms through the chest strap and feed them through to me please?�

That done I felt Ailsa pull very hard on the straps attached to my sleeves, hauling my arms tight against my chest.

�Spread your legs,� demanded Ailsa, slapping me on the backside!

I responded immediately, to find Ailsa grab the crotch strap that hung between my legs and haul that strap tight to buckle it.

�Nearly done,� said Ailsa as came round to face me again!

The last strap was on the front of the high collar of the canvas jacket:

�You can probably guess Dan that this is a bespoke straightjacket,� explained Ailsa. Not all straightjackets come with a leather neck strap but I think it is a great addition to this jacket.� 

As soon as the last buckle was done up, good and tight, Ailsa led me through the cell-block to the tight room, or the padded cell!

�You wait in there and I&#8217;ll be back in a second,� requested Ailsa as she pushed me inside, slamming closed and therefore locking the padded cell door.

There was little else for me to do except stand there and wait for Ailsa to return, which she did in a matter of minutes, unlocking and opening the door:

�I think this will add to your enjoyment this afternoon,� laughed Ailsa as she entered the padded cell holding another leather strap with two large cuffs attached.

�Do you not mean, add to my frustration this afternoon Ailsa,� I laughed in reply?

�Whatever,� replied Ailsa as she knelt down to buckle the two leather cuffs around both ankles? �Can you please kneel Dan?�

With some help from Ailsa I was soon leaning on the padded floor of the cell. I could then feel Ailsa attaching the leather strap from the ankle cuffs to the back of my jacket:

�What are doing honey,� I asked?

�Just adding to your afternoon of fun, I mean frustration,� replied Ailsa. �Now there is no way for you to stand up!�

Ailsa then popped back out of the cell for a few seconds to pick something else up. I recognised the ball-gag head harness as soon as she returned:

�No honey, that&#8217;s not needed,� I started to plead!

�Yeah but it will add to your fun this afternoon,� Ailsa teased in reply as she lifted the hideous looking web of leather towards my face. �Come on open up, you know that you want to!�

�Nah,� was all I got out as Ailsa used the opportunity to shove the massive red rubber ball into my mouth.

With me shaking my head and MUMPTHING as loud as I could, Ailsa pulled the straps into place. Around my head and under my chin before she tightened the buckle hard, forcing the rubber ball deep into my mouth and adding to what was sure not going to be a fun afternoon for me!

�See you later Dan, enjoy your afternoon,� laughed Ailsa as she left the padded cell, closing and locking the door behind her.

It was then the full reality of what bondage I&#8217;d just allowed Ailsa to put me into hit home: She was right; I couldn&#8217;t stand up because of the leather strap that now bound my ankles to the back of the straightjacket. The attempt to stand up just brought me crashing face first into the soft padding of the tight room floor. I screamed in frustration into my gag but as you can imagine, not a lot of sound escaped my lips. I struggled to sit but that was also impossible so the only option to me was to lay my side, bound with little to no movement until Ailsa returned for me. To be honest, it wasn&#8217;t an uncomfortable position and the only discomfort I felt was my aching jaw from the enormous rubber ball that had been forced into my mouth. The silk scarf protected my head from the harness that was buckled very tightly to hold the ball gag in place but apart from that I had little to do but lay there in silence and contemplate why I was here, locked in the padded cell bound so tightly? This of course made me very horney but again there was nothing I could do to relieve that particular itch! Yes the crotch strap was tight against the green Lycra tights and wearing only thin silk panties did mean I could get some pressure against my throbbing dick but no matter how much I tried, the bucking motion only served one purchase and that was to make me even more frustrated. I would stop for a while and then start to release myself from the confines of the canvas jacket. I&#8217;d get horney again and try to bring myself to orgasm but when that didn&#8217;t work I&#8217;d give up and rest until my energy returned and I&#8217;d begin the entire cycle again. I was therefore exhausted by the time Ailsa finally returned. She knelt down beside me and unbuckled the straps around my head. With a little effort the massive rubber ball popped out of my mouth, along with hours of saliva build up:

�Thank you sweetheart,� I whispered as the gag finally came off.

�You&#8217;re welcome my dear,� replied Ailsa rubbing her hands over my silk scarf covered head. �Would you like a drink of water?�

�Yes please,� I replied.

Ailsa got up and left the padded cell. She was back in less than a minute with a glass of water and a straw. She then helped me onto my knees and placed the straw into my mouth:

�Thanks Ailsa,� that was very nice thank you,� I praised my girlfriend and captor. 

�You&#8217;re welcome dearest,� Ailsa responded. �So how do you like the canvas jacket?�

�I&#8217;ve dreamt about being held in a tight straightjacket for years Ailsa,� I replied. �The leather jacket last weekend was fun but this is just so cool!�

�That&#8217;s nice to hear,� Ailsa came straight back at me. �You&#8217;ll not mind spending some more time in it!�

�Hey, that&#8217;s not fair,� I pleaded for some release from this cruel bondage.

�Who said this game would be fair,� Ailsa laughed in response to my pleading? �You&#8217;re clearly enjoying the canvas straightjacket and who am I to stop you having fun? Anyway, it is nearly six so I want to make us both a bite to eat. Can you handle another hour and then I&#8217;ll let you out?�

�As long as it is only an hour sweetheart and you don&#8217;t gag me again,� I pleaded for at least some freedom from another aching jaw.

Ailsa thought about my request for a minute and then started to kiss me, while at the same time rubbing her hands on my silk covered head:

�You really do like the silk scarf Ailsa,� I began to tease.

�You know I do,� Ailsa responded. �Silk scarves are so versatile,� she continued, now untying and removing the silk scarf that was secured to my head, Grace Kelly style.

Ailsa then smiled at me while she folded the green silk scarf into a thick band. I knew what was coming next and could do little to resist as Ailsa brought the silk up to my face, placing the soft padding across my eyes and tying the scarf tightly behind my head.

�Now isn&#8217;t that nice,� Ailsa laughed? �Your challenge for the next hour is to try and dislodge the scarf. 

�What do I get if I manage that,� I tried to get one over on Ailsa?

�You&#8217;re in no position to negotiate Dan,� responded Ailsa in a semi-serious voice.

�I was just trying to make this game interesting,� I came straight back at her.

�I&#8217;ll tell you what,� Ailsa set out her stall: �You dislodge the scarf and I&#8217;ll free you from the jacket for dinner and if you don&#8217;t, I will free your legs but you remain in the jacket for the rest of this evening.�

�That&#8217;s just not fair,� I replied.

�Again I&#8217;ll repeat myself Dan,� Ailsa continued the one-sided approach to my current bondage and her fun: �Who said life was fair and if you continue moaning you&#8217;ll spend all night in the straightjacket!�

�Okay you win sweetheart,� I gave in.

�I knew you&#8217;d see it my way,� responded Ailsa as she got up and exited the padded cell, closing and locking the padded door behind her.

So here I was once again, for the fourth hour secured in the straightjacket and locked in Ailsa&#8217;s padded cell. To say I wasn&#8217;t enjoying myself would have been a lie but the four hours had been long and I was getting uncomfortable, especially my need to take a leak. I did have a challenge and that was to see again or should I say, dislodge the green silk scarf that blindfolded me. This meant me crashing to the padded floor once again and using my nose, pushing against the padded wall with the objective of at least getting a little movement on the scarf so that it could slide down my face. This was much more difficult than I had expected. The padded walls gave me absolutely no way to ease the scarf out of places by the time Ailsa returned, I still couldn&#8217;t see:

�I can see you&#8217;ve not managed to dislodge the scarf,� laughed Ailsa!

I looked up in the direction of Ailsa&#8217;s voice and smiled:

�Sadly not my dear,� I sarcastically replied.

�Oh dear,� replied Ailsa. �You know what that means!�

I then felt Ailsa working on the leather strap that kept my ankles bent towards my jacketed body. Once that was undone I felt her unbuckle and remove the leather cuffs that bound my ankles together:

�Right onto your feet my boy,� demanded Ailsa as she helped me to finally stand for the first time in hours. �There is no point wasting the nice meal I&#8217;ve prepared.�

With my arms still bound so tightly in the straightjacket and my sight still gone from the thick green silk scarf that covered my face, Ailsa led me out of the padded cell. As we exited the nice soft floor and stepped onto the hard concrete, she helped me back into the low healed leather shoes. That complete, I was led blind back to the house and the warmth of the kitchen. It was only then did Ailsa tug the scarf from around my face until it rested around my neck.

�Honey, I badly need to take a leak, can you please at least remove the jacket and allow me to eat in relative freedom?

Ailsa stood in front of me for a minute before agreeing to unbuckle the straightjacket.

�If I let you out of this Dan,� Ailsa set out her demands before starting the process to unbuckle the straightjacket. �You will not complain when I lock you in a cell for the night?�

�Oh honey,� I complained. �I was so looking forward to spending the night with you again.

Ailsa stood facing me:

�Not tonight honey,� I explained. �I love knowing that you&#8217;re locked up all safe in your cell at night so the deal is simple: You want out of the jacket now to take a piss then you agree to a night in a cell!�

I had little choice (again) but to accept Ailsa&#8217;s demands but at least she was now unbuckling the jacket that had imprisoned me. My piss was therefore even more enjoyable but as I washed my hands, I looked at the image looking back at me in the mirror. As I dried my hands, I played with the green silk scarf that hung from my neck. It looked untidy so I untied the knot behind my head and folded the scarf once more into a triangle. I loved the feeling of the soft silk around my head so I decided that the Grace Kelly style would work again this evening so soon my head (excluding my face) was once more covered in the luxurious layer of soft silk.

�Umm, you look great,� explained Ailsa as I entered the Kitchen to the wonderful smell of home cooking. �I love the way that scarf complements your dress.�

�Yeah, I love it also,� I replied.�

We then sat down to dinner and talked for the next few hours:

�So what time would you like to leave for the mainland tomorrow,� I asked as we started to pack the dishwasher?

�You&#8217;re the pilot honey,� responded Ailsa. �It is your decision!�

�Okay, I&#8217;ll check the weather when I get up and then we can make a decision,� I replied.

�Don&#8217;t you mean, you can check the weather when I free you from your jail cell,� Ailsa responed sarcastically?

�I guess so,� I laughed!

�Anyway, it is getting late now Dan,� explained Ailsa as we put the finally remnants of dinner away. �I&#8217;d like to take a bath and get an early night so it&#8217;s jail for you.�

�Do you have to lock me up this early sweetheart,� I replied? �It&#8217;s only nine o&#8217;clock!�

�I&#8217;m afraid so Dan,� Ailsa came straight back at me, taking hold of me and planting a kissing on my lips. 

We kissed a little bit longer until Ailsa broke for air:

�Would you like to spend tonight in one of my special sleeping bags,� asked Ailsa?

�Do I have a choice,� I replied? �Anyway, what is so special about your sleeping bag?�

�Follow me,� demanded Ailsa, grabbing me by the hand and leading me towards the back door. �Pick up the straightjacket and we&#8217;ll put it back in the store!�

We headed back outside and across the yard to Ailsa&#8217;s outhouse of fun. Once there we placed the straightjacket back onto its&#8217; hanger and Ailsa pulled a leather sleep-sack from a drawer:

�This is it,� explained Ailsa: �Once you&#8217;re in this sleeping bag, you&#8217;re in it for the night!�

Ailsa then unzipped the leather sleep-sack and showed me the built in sleeves and the built in mask with only a small hole around the lower face so that I could breathe easily. It was clear once I was zipped into this thing I wouldn&#8217;t be able to move my arms of see!

�How do I take a piss,� I asked?

�I put you into an adult nappy (diaper to you Americans),� responded Ailsa, lifting a large plastic nappy from an adjacent drawer. �I do however recommend you go to the toilet before bedtime though!�

I just looked at Ailsa who I thought was going mad:

�Are you crazy Ailsa,� I stood in utter dismay at her suggestion?

It was clear Ailsa had made up her mind so I followed her to the first cell. She suggested that I go to the toilet and undress before pulling on the plastic nappy:

�You might also feel more comfortable pulling your tights back on over the nappy,� suggested Ailsa as she slipped out of the cell, slamming the heavy door behind herm locking me inside!

I couldn&#8217;t believe what I was letting myself in for tonight but I followed Ailsa&#8217;a instructions and after taking my last leak of the night, I pulled on the horrible padded plastic nappy, followed the green Lycra tights I&#8217;d worn all day. Ailsa was back in less than ten minutes with a silk nightdress:

�Umm, nice look,� Ailsa teased as she unlocked and opened my cell door, handing me a green silk night dress to match my tights.

I slipped into the nightdress as Ailsa prepared the sleep-sack.

�The zip runs along the back of this sleep-sack Dan,� explained Ailsa on how I should negotiate getting into the long leather sleeping bag. �If you sit on the bed and ease your feet in first, I&#8217;ll help you with your arms!�

Ailsa did her best to direct me into the tight bag. It was made of the finest soft black leather and was padded inside. My arms had to slide into the built in sleeves before Ailsa had to take over the exercise, pulling the rest of the sleeping bag up my body.

�Good night sweetheart,� Ailsa finally kissed me on the lips before pulling the padded hood over my face.

�Good night you too,� I replied as Ailsa started pulling on the zip until it rested on top of my head and therefore the built in hood.

Now that I was safely inside my sleep-sack for the night, Ailsa helped me onto my back before biding me goodnight again and then leaving the cell, locking the door behind her. I therefore remained stuck inside the leather sleep-sack for the rest of the night with means of escape no matter how much I tried!

I lay for ages on that Sunday evening. As you would expect, I remained horney but with my arms stuck by my side in the tight leather sleep-sack there was absolutely no release for me during that long and very hot night. I lay there, trying to relax, hoping that sleep would finally take over and my night in this tight bondage would end much faster. As I relaxed in what was going to be hellish night, sleep did finally arrive!



Monday morning and going nowhere!


When I finally awoke on Monday morning, I&#8217;d no way of telling what time it actually was! My world was in complete darkness and I was hot. Both were insignificant to the pain in my bladder, telling me that I urgently needed to take a piss. Despite wearing the nappy under the thick green Lycra tights, I couldn&#8217;t bring myself to pissing in my pants! There was also no sound from outside my cell so I drifted in and out of sleep until finally I heard Ailsa unlocking and entering my cell. 

�Good morning sleepy-head,� announced Ailsa as she turned me onto my side and pulled down the zip, allowing the hood to be pulled from my face.

�Good morning gorgeous,� I replied staring at the black faceless figure that stood over me.

This morning Ailsa was covered from head to toe in a black leather catsuit. It covered her entire body, including her face with only a mouth and two eyes showing, highlighted by the red leather trim that encircled both openings in the black leather catsuit.

�Do you like,� Asked Ailsa?

�Yes,� I replied! �I will not be flying you back to the mainland wearing it though!�

�We&#8217;ll not be flying anywhere my dear,� responded Ailsa. �It is very foggy outside so we&#8217;re going nowhere! I have brought you some breakfast so try and sit up so that I can feed you?�

�You mean, you are not releasing me from the leather prison,� I started to get a little worried?

Ailsa picked up the bowl of cereal and returned to my bed, sitting down beside me:

�You don&#8217;t need to be released,� Ailsa explained her devious plan for today. �I fancy a little self-bondage in the other cell today so you&#8217;ll be very comfortable in here today.�

�You can&#8217;t do that to me,� I replied in a slight panic as Ailsa fed me breakfast! �I&#8217;ve been Horney for hours and I need to take a piss very badly!�

�Aww, poor little Danny needs to take a pee-pee,� tease a leather clad Ailsa. �You have a nappy so just use it!�

�That&#8217;s not fair Ailsa,� I complained (raising my voice!

Ailsa just stood up and headed for the table at the end of my jail cell bed. I could see that she&#8217;d just picked up the long green silk scarf I&#8217;d worn yesterday. 

�You can be a bastard sometimes Dan,� yelled Ailsa as she folded the green triangle into a tight band, before tying a knot in the middle. Ailsa then took hold of my head and forced the silk knot into my mouth and tied the ends of the scarf behind my head. �I like having you as my little bound up slave so unless your attitude changes, you might be locked in for a very long time!�

All I could do was MUMPTH into my gag as Ailsa pulled the built in hood over my head and zipped the sleep sack shut. The last thing I heard was the cell door closing, locking me inside once again, with absolutely no idea when I&#8217;d next be released from either the jail cell or leather sleep sack. I lay there for hours, desperate to take a piss so at some point hours after being incarcerated, I finally gave in, peeing in my nappy that I&#8217;d worn since before nine last night. I prayed that Ailsa would return but she didn&#8217;t. I guess she&#8217;d planned a long day of self-bondage so I lay trapped in the leather sleep-sack with nothing to do, unable to see or speak!



To be continued�.
