Synopsis: A simple telling from the submissive point of view of an afternoon visit to a motel to meet a man she only knows as Master.






We make eye contact as you walk down the sidewalk at the motel towards me.� You reach out and slowly take my hand.� Sweetly, we grasp hands and feel that first shot of electricity go through our bodies.� A warm sensation begins to travel down my spine and find its way to my pussy.� It begins to swell and become aroused, wet, anticipating.
�
We step inside, still seeming so innocent, but knowing what is waiting for us inside.� Coats come off, shoes come off...we start to go further but are overcome with wanting, and embrace before disrobing any further.� Pressing, caressing, feeling the touch of one another that we haven't felt in so long.� Reacquainting ourselves with the curves and feel of our bodies as they move together and begin to meld.�� Our mouths meet...first softly, kissing, sucking on each others lips, finding each other, then more urgent and probing.� Our tongues mingling together reaching for one another, sharing that intimacy and desire that is so apparent as the kisses become more passionate.
�
The heat of the moment is enough to keep us warm, so we begin to undress.� Buttons come undone, my blouse raised above my head revealing my breasts.� As my top is finally pulled away, my hair comes falling back down across my shoulders.� Slightly disheveled, giving me the wanton look that is so fitting with my eyes as I gaze into yours.
�
We crawl into bed as the last of our clothing falls to the floor.� Finally, our bodies pressed together as one with nothing to restrain us. My breasts soft, your cock so hard as it presses against my sex.� We continue to kiss as the momentum builds.� Your head slowly moves down and you begin to suck on my nipples.� They are already hard with anticipation, but you bring them up even more.� Your face almost disappears between them as you gather up all of the flesh that are my breasts and revel in them.�� You come back up and steal a kiss. 

Now it is my turn to travel south.� I kiss your chest, licking, and slowly brushing my lips on you as I move down, my hair traveling slowly behind me softly caressing you in the wake of the wetness of my lips.� I find the head of your cock, hard and demanding.� I touch my lips to it and hear the intake of your breath as you anticipate what is to come.� My lips slowing wrap around the head feeling the slickness of your precum mixing with the wetness of my mouth.� I suck in as much of you as I can and begin to slowly move down the shaft.� Sucking gently, then more urgently as I find the rhythm that seems to please you.� I feel your hands on my head, your fingers entwined in my hair urging me to continue, showing me the beat of your pleasure.� The pace quickens, I can almost feel your heart beat as your cock throbs in my mouth.� I am torn between wanting to continue and wanting to feel you inside of me.
�
I look up into your eyes and beg you to fuck me.� I need it.� But I know that I have to submit myself to you on a greater level before I can have what I so desperately want.&nbsp; I move over to the side and present myself to you.&nbsp; On my knees, legs spread to properly display my wanton, wet pussy.&nbsp; Shoulders back to offer my breasts to you to do whatever you want to with them.&nbsp; Arms down, palms up offering myself to you for punishment.&nbsp; I know that only your naughty slut would come and meet you at a place like this and be so ready to fucked so quickly.&nbsp; I feel your eyes scanning my body and I flush with the humiliation of being so openly displayed for you.&nbsp; You walk around the bed taking in every angle of me.&nbsp; Then I feel your hand on my back pushing me firmly to press my face into the mattress.&nbsp; Now I know that you can see very closely how wet my pussy is and you have direct access to my tight asshole to abuse at will.&nbsp; You slide your fingers into my pussy, so slick and wanting and give my clit a firm pinch.&nbsp; The shockwave makes me suck in a breath.&nbsp; Before I can recover you begin to firmly spank my cunt, telling me what a naughty little slut I am for being so wet and displaying myself so ludely.&nbsp; All I can do is suffer the humiliation and enjoy the sensation as my pussy begins to burn with each spank.&nbsp; I arch my back to give you even better access knowing what the view I am giving you is, and needing to show you.&nbsp; You demand that I reach back and spread my ass cheeks for you as you spank my tight hole directly and firmly.&nbsp; As you alternate between my ass and my pussy I am almost humping your hand as it makes contact.&nbsp; I beg you to put your cock in my mouth again, I want to feel it fill me up and to honor you in that way.&nbsp; But you have other plans.

You flip me over harshly, my legs splay out wide open.&nbsp; You reach down, pulling my pussy lips wide open and land a few, hard spanks directly on my clit.&nbsp; When my life became about needing to spanked on my clit I will never know, but the shame and arousal are so interspersed I hardly know where one leaves off and the other begins.

You come down on me with great force and I feel the weight of you pressing against me, feel your cock pressing into my pussy.� That first moment as it breaks the precipice of me takes my breath away.� It is almost a painful moment of wanting it so much, needing it.� You begin to take me.� Hard, strong, urgent.� I wrap my legs around you.� I can feel the burn on my cunt and ass as you pound me directly where you were just punishing me.&nbsp; I whisper longingly "your cock feels so good inside of me Master, I love to feel it inside of me while the feeling of it in my mouth still lingers"� You know that you can have me any way that you want me.� I will take you in my mouth and feel your pleasure as it pulses down my throat, or open myself in that very intimate way and allow you to penetrate me in my ass knowing that the tightness there would most certainly please you.� Or I will pull you in tightly, fiercely, and give into that moment when my body sends every pleasure that I can ever imagine to one place in my body, and it rips through my as I cling desperately to you, then feel you pulse inside of me.� Giving all of you to me as I give myself to you.
�
I hold tightly to you until we both are spent, the sensitivity still lingers, and ebb and flow of pleasure subsides to a general warmth all over.� I feel the strength of your fingers in my hair as you pull it tightly in your grip and pull my face to you.&nbsp; I am still gasping for air, but I want to kiss you sweetly.� Instead, you invade my mouth with your tongue in a last show that you own all of me.&nbsp; I feel it penetrate me and it sends another shock wave through my body, down to my wet pussy that is still pulsing around your cock and I am wracked with another orgasm.&nbsp; This time it is the mere thought of being taken and owned that puts me over the edge.&nbsp; Finally, when you see that I cannot take any more, you bring the pleasure slowly to a warm, tender level.� 
�
I tell you that I love you, knowing in my heart that you love me too.�� We stay close, and just spend the rest of our time together enjoying the tingle that is what is left of our moment of intense desire.�Your ownership of me, my need to be owned.&nbsp; We talk, caress, and laugh.� Reveling in each moment so that we can remember it and hold it in our memories in a way that recreates that visceral feeling until we meet again.&nbsp; Thank you master.
