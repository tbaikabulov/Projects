���� Her eyes slowly blinked open to the soft
sunlight seeping through the curtains. With a little yawn she turned her head
to him, her soft lips curled into a smile as her eyes instantly found his. He'd
been watching her sleeping again, as he so often did. She whispered good
morning in that soft husky morning voice of hers and leaned to towards him.
That was when she realised something was wrong, she couldn't move close enough
to kiss him, glancing upwards she saw her wrists bound by soft silk, the other
end attached to the bed. She turned to look at him, that evil grin spread
across his face, the one she couldn't resist, the one that turned her insides
to jelly and only made her need for him increase. He had bound her tightly to
the bed as she slept. She arched one brow and whispered again 'Master?'. He
just chuckled and bent over her, his lips catching hers in a savage hungry
embrace that made her breath catch in her throat, she lifted her head, wanting,
needing more. But he backed off with a smile 'Now don't be greedy baby'. She
fell back against the pillow with a hmph!, frustrated, but willing to play
along..for now. She wondered what he had in store for her today. She knew they
had a good few hours alone with no disturbances, the thought sent a shiver of
apprehensive pleasure through her.

&nbsp;

���� He leaned over her once more and she
closed her eyes, ready for his kiss, but it didn't come, instead there was a
feather light touch across her eyes as another scarf was tied in place to
obscure her vision. She could make out the light from the window but nothing
more. She lay against the cool satin in bondage, resigning herself to his
command. Suddenly an intense exquisite pain shot through her body, making her
squeal then moan. Then the pain shot through her again and she realised he'd
clamped her nipples. She bit down on her lip as the erect little buds
accustomed themselves to the pressure. The sound of his laughter echoed through
the room. How he loved to see her in such a state, torn between pleasure and
pain, and completly powerless to do anything about it. She gasped as he twisted
the clamps slightly, her back arching off the bed in reaction. His fingers left
her nipples and slid down the soft curves of her body, one finger dipping
between her thighs to test just how excited she was getting. He let it rest
there for a moment between the damp silky folds of flesh, withdrawing it he
placed it to her lips, smearing them with her own juices. Her tongue slipped
out to catch his finger, but he was too quick. Instead she felt him bite down
gently on her tongue, sucking it into his mouth and claiming her in a brutal
kiss. She returned with a kiss just as savage as his, her teeth nipping at his
lips. He wouldn't let her get away with that this time and he twisted the clamp
on her nipple, she let out a yelp against his mouth, backing down instantly. he
wasn't in the mood for her bratish behaviour today, just total obidience.

&nbsp;

���� She felt him sit up on their bed,� reaching for something. He lay beside her
once more and a shiver ran through her as an icy cold wetness touched her neck.
Icecubes! He hadn't played this game before and her lips spread in a grin, he
was getting more adventurous with their games. The ice in his fingers slid down
her neck and between the valley of her breasts, melting slighty. The icy water
trickling over her body in little streams. He slid it over her body to her
tummy to her belly button. He left it there and she once again felt him reach
for something. This time, instead of the icy chill on her skin it was an
intense heat splashing against her naked flesh. She cried out, the heat
intensified by her chilled skin. Then again the heat splashed her body. He was
using candle wax on her. The hot wax dribbled over her, hardening almost
instantly. He poured it over her breasts, her tummy, everywhere the ice had
touched. This was truly wicked, the combination of ice and fire sent her senses
reeling. She moaned softly, wriggling on the bed. She needed him, ohhh how she
needed him. Her thighs slipped open instinctivly. Her pussy damp and desperate
for his touch, a touch she knew wouldn't come for a long time yet. The ice was
now an icy pool of water in her belly button and his finger dipped into it,
tracing a cold path over her body to her thighs. His fingers slipped between
their softness but didn't venture anywhere near her waiting pussy. He laughed
out loud as she pushed up towards his fingers, desperate for the slightest
touch. His fingers left her body only to return a moment later in a� stinging slap against the delicate folds 'Not
yet baby, be patient. It'll be worth it, I promise'. She pouted and huffed a
bit in frustration, this only earning her another slap, this time against her
inner thigh. She hissed at him 'Bastard!'. She regreted it as soon as the word
left her mouth, she bit down hard on her lip. 'Sorry baby, did you say
something?' his lips so close to her ear shocked her, making her jump. She
started to say sorry, only to find a finger placed against her lip 'Not another
word out of that pretty little mouth of yours'. He moved his finger from her
lips, his hand sliding up her cheek, the fingers catching in and grasping her hair.
He pulled her head back sharply, her mouth opened in a gasp, to be instantly
filled by his cock. He pushed it deep into her throat, making her gag slightly
as she got used to it filling her throat and mouth. His fingers twisted in her
hair, drawing her head up and down the length of his cock as he spoke 'There
now, that will keep you quiet won't it?'. All she could do was nod and suck on
his cock. 

&nbsp;

���� She sucked on him hungrily, she loved
doing this and he knew it. She loved the pleasure it gave it him, the feeling
of him filling her hot, wet mouth. She sucked him hard and deep before letting
her mouth go slack on him, only her tongue teasing the head of his throbbing
cock. The little silver ball of her piercing teasing him till he moaned out
loud and her forced her mouth down on him again. Fucking her face hard and
fast. His other hand resting on her breast, the fingers tightening on the clamp
and twisting, she let out a cry of pain. He took advantage of her open mouth
and forced his cock even deeper down her throat, she knew he was close so she
sucked harder and faster, her face muscles aching, but she didn't stop. She
wanted his cum, she needed to taste him, deep in her throat. Both hands caught
up in her hair now as he pulled her on and off his cock, shouting out as his
cock started to jerk in her mouth and his hot cum exploded out of him, shooting
into her mouth. She swallowed it down, grinning to herself, she'd done him
proud once more. He collapsed down onto the bed next to her, panting as he recovered.
He pulled her to him in a tight embrace, she could feel his heart hammering
against her own chest. His head on the pillow next to hers, he whispered in her
ear 'Your turn baby'.

&nbsp;

���� His fingers found her soaking pussy
instantly, and he knew just how much she had enjoyed him using her mouth. They
slid gently between her lips, finding the hard bud of her clit straight away.
The intensity of his touch made her gasp. He let his fingers play for a few
seconds before pulling them away. She groaned in frustration as he moved his
hand to stroke the soft silky flesh of her inner thighs. His voice was husky as
he spoke 'Beg me baby, you need to tell me exactly how much you want to touch
you'. She shook her head, he knew she didn't like this, she'd never conquered
her shyness. But she also knew if she didn't talk he wouldn't make her cum. And
she REALLY needed to cum. She whispered softly 'Please Master, touch me', he
shook his head 'Not good enough, try again'. Her cheeks were burning now, but
she spoke again 'Master please, touch my pussy. I need you, I need your fingers
inside me and touching my clit. Please Master make me cum'. She heard the smile
in his voice and she knew she had done enough 'Better baby'. And his fingers
slid once more into her pussy, two fingers slipped inside her as his thumb
rubbed against her clit. Her hips bucked and she pushed herself further onto
him 'More Master, please'. He knew wot she wanted and she was going to get it,
another finger slipped inside her, streching her. He fingered her for a while
before forcing another deep inside, her pussy streching around his hand. He
continued fucking her with his fingers as his thumb carried on caressing her
clit. She pushed herself hard against him and he responded, forcing his thumb
into her dripping pussy. With one last push he was inside her, his whole fist.
She clenched herself on it, writhed against it, moaning and whimpering in
pleasure. His mouth closed over clit, the tip of his tongue teasing and
probing, causing her hips to buck faster against him. Her bound hands gripped
the bed as waves of pleasure starting raging through her. Her pussy clenching
tight around his fist, juices pouring from her and down over his arm. She
screamed out his name as the orgasm ripped through her, over and over as waves
of pleasure shook her to the core. 

&nbsp;

���� Finally her body stilled and she lay
trembling and gasping on the bed. He moved to her and cradlded her shaking body
in his arms. One hand reaching to release her nipples from the clamps, the
sudden release of pressure making her scream in pain. His lips closed on hers
to hush her cries as he released the other clamp. And he gently rubbed some
life back into her tortured nipples. He then untied her bound hands and again
rubbed some feeling back into them. She lay against him, her body still
trembling from the experiences of the last few hours. He just held her close
and whispered in her ear 'I love you baby, well done. Now go and make me
breakfast'. Her head snapped round in astonishment only to see the teasing look
in his eyes and the grin curling his lips, she gave him a gentle shove and
replied 'I love you too...Master'.
