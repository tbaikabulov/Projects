  Something Different
  
  
  Today we are interviewing Super A.� Tell me Super, what makes you different?
  
 
 
  
  Super A
  
  
  Today is an anniversary for me.� Eight years ago today, on March 7th, 1997, my
  keyholder locked my chastity belt
  
 
 
  
  &nbsp;
  
  
  &nbsp;
  
 
 
  
  SD
  
  
  And you have been locked up since?
  
 
 
  
  SA
  
  
  Yes, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week or 24/7 as we say.
  
 
 
  
  &nbsp;
  
  
  &nbsp;
  
 
 
  
  SD
  
  
  Hmmm�Let me see, that�s 8 years.� Eight years, that is a long time!� Are you saying you have not been out of your
  chastitybelt in 8 years?
  
 
 
  
  SA
  
  
  Oh no, it hasn�t been eight continuous years.� My keyholder lets me out on now and then.
  
 
 
  
  &nbsp;
  
  
  &nbsp;
  
 
 
  
  SD
  
  
  What do you mean?
  
 
 
  
  SA
  
  
  Although I have been wearing a CB for eight years, I
  usually never wear it for more than two to three weeks at a time.
  
 
 
  
  &nbsp;
  
  
  &nbsp;
  
 
 
  
  SD
  
  
  Usually?
  
 
 
  
  SA
  
  
  On the average my keyholder unlocks me every 2-3
  weeks.� But I have spent two periods of
  over 30 contiguous days in my belt.�
  And once I spent 105 days without relief.
  
 
 
  
  &nbsp;
  
  
  &nbsp;
  
 
 
  
  SD
  
  
  What do you mean � without relief?
  
 
 
  
  SA
  
  
  Just exactly that � no sexual activity for 105 days.� No intercourse, no masturbation, no
  fondling, nothing.
  
 
 
  
  &nbsp;
  
  
  &nbsp;
  
 
 
  
  SD
  
  
  Why were you locked up for such a long time.
  
 
 
  
  SA
  
  
  I am a stubborn man.�
  My wife and keyholder wanted something I was unwilling to give
  her.� She informed me that my belt was
  not coming off until I gave it some serious thought.
  
 
 
  
  &nbsp;
  
  
  &nbsp;
  
 
 
  
  SD
  
  
  So she kept you locked up all that time?� How do you perform normal functions?
  
 
 
  
  SA
  
  
  Modern day chastitybelts are designed so you really do not
  have to ever remove them.� One can
  perform all of the normal bodily functions � urinate, defecate, take a shower
  and even go to beach.� However personal
  hygiene is a little easier if it is removed.
  
 
 
  
  &nbsp;
  
  
  &nbsp;
  
 
 
  
  SD
  
  
  When you walked in here, despite knowing the interview
  topic in advance, I must admit I was looking for clues, but could see
  none.� How do I know you are telling
  the truth?� How do I know you are
  locked in a chastitybelt.
  
 
 
  
  SA
  
  
  [Opens button on jeans and pulls waistband of FTL
  underwear down a bit.]� See? � This one
  is made of fiberglass so it will not set off any metal detector devices.
  
 
 
  
  &nbsp;
  
  
  &nbsp;
  
 
 
  
  SD
  
  
  That appears to be an impressive device � may I see more?� [Stands up and drops jeans and
  shorts.]� Wow! This appears to be very
  secure.
  
 
 
  
  SA
  
  
  Yes, my complete package is locked up.� With this one, I cannot touch anything in
  my �bikini area�.
  
 
 
  
  &nbsp;
  
  
  &nbsp;
  
 
 
  
  SD
  
  
  What do you mean this one?�
  Do you have more than one?
  
 
 
  
  SA
  
  
  Yes this one was made by Reinhold who was located about 40
  miles outside of Cologne Germany,
  but I regret to say he is no longer in business.� I also have two other belts.� My first one, a Jones, was the first one I
  owned and the one I was locked up in on March 1997.
  
 
 
  
  &nbsp;
  
  
  &nbsp;
  
 
 
  
  SD
  
  
  And your second?
  
 
 
  
  SA
  
  
  It was first known as a �Walter�, but now he goes by the
  tradename of Carrara.� I received it in August of 1997 after
  waiting for it for almost 8 months.� It
  has a serial number of #106 and I understand he has made over one thousand
  more since I bought mine.
  
 
 
  
  &nbsp;
  
  
  &nbsp;
  
 
 
  
  SD
  
  
  You had to wait eight months?
  
 
 
  
  SA
  
  
  Oh yes.� All
  chastitybelts are custom produced based on your individual measurements and
  they take time to build as they are custom crafted.
  
 
 
  
  &nbsp;
  
  
  &nbsp;
  
 
 
  
  SD
  
  
  Really?
  
 
 
  
  SA
  
  
  All chastity devices that are belts require it.� There are other devices on the market for
  example CB2000 and Lori Tube that are more generic.� That is - they do not require custom
  measurements.
  
 
 
  
  &nbsp;
  
  
  &nbsp;
  
 
 
  
  SD
  
  
  Are they any advantages or disadvantages to those types of
  chastity devices?
  
 
 
  
  SA
  
  
  First off, I have never owned either of them, so I cannot
  speak from a personal opinion.� But I
  have heard that some of them are not as secure unless you are also pierced
  and both the device and the piercing are used to ensure you can not
  escape.� However some still allow
  touching and for some guys this is enough for them orgasm.
  
 
 
  
  &nbsp;
  
  
  &nbsp;
  
 
 
  
  SD
  
  
  Why does a man wear a CB?
  
 
 
  
  SA
  
  
  Sometimes it is a consensual thing, other times it is a
  power exchange.� But like all other BDSM
  activities, it requires some consent.�
  By and large it is a very erotic experience to have ones loins under
  control of someone else.� But once you
  consent, and the belt is locked, there is usually no turning back until that
  key is brought out again.� 
  
 
 
  
  &nbsp;
  
  
  &nbsp;
  
 
 
  
  SD
  
  
  But why do people lock other people in CB�s?
  
 
 
  
  SA
  
  
  Sexual activity is a very gratifying experience for most
  people and they will do almost anything to get it � witness all of the
  cheating men and women out there.� But
  to stop someone from having sexual enjoyment and to control them by having them do whatever you want is a powerful
  experience.� Many keyholders
  use sex as a reward for good behavior such as giving a bone to a dog, or they
  use the lack of sex as a punishment � hence they keep an individual locked up
  without release.� 
  
 
 
  
  &nbsp;
  
  
  &nbsp;
  
 
 
  
  SD
  
  
  This is a turn of events from the days of the Crusades.
  
 
 
  
  SA
  
  
  No, not really.�
  Back then, women were property and men protected their property from
  devaluation or cheating by locking women up.�
  Today, since most of the �lockees� are men.� Women are now protecting their property and
  keeping their man from straying.
  And I�ve heard of stories about a parent locking up their
  daughter for protection reasons, but again I cannot determine if it is true
  or just a story.
  
 
 
  
  &nbsp;
  
  
  &nbsp;
  
 
 
  
  SD
  
  
  So apparently they make female chastity belts too?
  
 
 
  
  SA
  
  
  Oh yes, but from my unscientific research, I would say
  about 90% of the chastised people are men, but that varies by country.� It is significantly tougher to make a CB
  that will stop a woman from receiving any sexual gratification vs stopping a man.�
  Stopping intercourse is easy, but female masturbation is far more
  difficult to prevent unless the belt fits perfectly.
  
 
 
  
  &nbsp;
  
  
  &nbsp;
  
 
 
  
  SD
  
  
  So what would happen right now if I stripped down to my
  bra and panties?
  
 
 
  
  SA
  
  
  You are already a very sexy woman and I have been semi
  excited since I met you and because of that I am as about as hard as I can
  get.� With this particular belt I can
  experience about 50% of a normal erection.�
  Other than that, nothing else can or will happen as I do not have a
  set of keys.
  
 
 
  
  &nbsp;
  
  
  &nbsp;
  
 
 
  
  SD
  
  
  Does it hurt?
  
 
 
  
  SA
  
  
  Not physically, only mentally.� But once in awhile, all belts seem to get a
  fold of skin in the wrong place and pinch it a little.
  
 
 
  
  &nbsp;
  
  
  &nbsp;
  
 
 
  
  SD
  
  
  Are these things detectable?
  
 
 
  
  SA
  
  
  As I mentioned some are made of metal and obviously will
  make a metal detector scream.� But
  under most circumstances, most people will not know if a person is wearing a
  CB as you proved 5 minutes ago.
  
 
 
  
  &nbsp;
  
  
  &nbsp;
  
 
 
  
  SD
  
  
  What types of feelings do you have when you are locked up?
  
 
 
  
  SA
  
  
  Besides being horny all the time?� LOL.�
  Depending how long you have been at it, one can have quite a broad
  range.� Usually the first couple of
  hours (even after 8 years) it is still somewhat erotic, but in my case that
  turns to frustration for the next 40 hours as you quickly find out you cannot
  give yourself any sexual gratification.�
  Sometimes even a mild case of depression can set in, when you realize
  you are locked up and there is no way out.
  
 
 
  
  &nbsp;
  
  
  &nbsp;
  
 
 
  
  SD
  
  
  Surely, you can cut off � somehow?
  
 
 
  
  SA
  
  
  Depending on the device, some of these toys cost only a
  couple hundred dollars while some cost well over $1000.� This one, for example was $700 in
  1999.� So after you spend that much on
  a toy, you are 1) a little reluctant to ruin it by cutting it off; and 2)
  that does not take into account the wrath of the keyholder who may have some
  other type of �power� over you and wishes to see you �suffer�, so you leave
  it on.
  
 
 
  
  &nbsp;
  
  
  &nbsp;
  
 
 
  
  SD
  
  
  This has been a very interesting interview Super A, I wish
  we could continue.� Where can someone
  go to find out more?
  
 
 
  
  SA
  
  
  Of course the internet is loaded with lots of sites and
  groups associated with chastity � all one has to do is search.� One of the first sites and in my opinion,
  the best, is altairboy.com.� And once
  you find someone, most people are usually willing to talk about their
  experiences as long as their identity is protected.� But if anyone has any questions, they can
  email me at supera_sa@yahoo.com.
