Chapter 1: Peeping Tom 


Rodney was your average college freshmen, or perhaps more specifically your average college freshmen nerd. Graduating at the top of his class in high school, his strong application and chess club credentials had let him write his way into the top ivy leagues. He had great ambitions coming to college, plenty for his academics but even more for his social life. He would finally be, �a college man,� as his father used to say. With an Ivy League pedigree he had expected women would fall all over him. Six months into college life he realized that he was sadly mistaken. He had yet to �make out�, let alone �hook-up�. His freshman year was almost over and he was feeling the pressure especially considering his roommate seemed to attract girls like bees to a honey pot.  It didn�t help his frustration that the girl next door was probably the hottest in the entire dorm, perhaps in the east campus. Suffice to say, he spent a lot of time jacking off, and hiding this fact from his roommate. 


It was almost one am in the morning when Rodney finished a key part of his online game. He had spent a good portion of his senior year in high school, and the previous few months slowly climbing the game�s hierarchy. He took pride in his post as the grand duke of the federations. 


�Let�s see those fucking jocks to something like this,� he murmured as he declared war on the planet of Arystal. He leaned back in his chair watching the thousands of real people represented by virtual characters do his bidding. There was nothing to do now but to watch and wait. It was while waiting that he heard the first loud thump. It shook the shelving on his wall and nearly dropped his Math 130 book on his computer. He quickly got up to steady the shelving units only to be greeted by loud moans through the wall. His hands trembled as he slowly sat down back onto his chair. A grin played onto his face. This was the time he had been waiting for. It hadn�t been a long wait. 


Being a captain in the online geek universe allowed him access to some of the best minds in the field of electronic surveillance. It also helped that he was pursuing a degree in electrical engineering. He made sure his door was locked, placing a chair so that he would have a few seconds advanced warning if his roommate decided to come back early from his alleged study session. 


 He pressed a small button on a device next to his computer, and the image of the online game was replaced by the scene from the room next door. A took a few moments for Rodney to adjust the camera focus and contrast. Once he got it to work, he took in a sharp breadth. 


The room was lit by light from numerous candles spread over the room furniture. The wax was red and the candles looked like the expensive scented kind he had seen in online sex toy stores. The room was neat and tidy compared to his, and instead of the college dual bed system, there was only a single bed on the floor. The girl was a senior, and had her own single. But it was not these details that took a partial amount of Rodney�s breadth away, nor was it the empty bottles of wine, or the silent pornography playing in the background. Rodney realized for the first time, that Karen, the object of his fantasies was bi. 


He watched mesmerized as they red light reflected off their lightly tanned skin. Karen was definitely the hotter one, but the other girl was a good comparison, and it seemed as if he had seen her somewhere before. He suddenly could feel intense pressure in his groin area, as his erect penis began to fight with the tough fabric of his old jeans. He unzipped his jeans, freeing his frequently trapped prisoner. Using his legs against the footrest of the table, he leaned his wooden chair back, and started massaging his penis through his boxers. He could already feel the pre-cum dripping through the fabric. 


The scene in front of him was getting quite a bit hot. Karen was naked save for a red pendant hung around her neck. She laid on her back her arms to her sides, palms facing upwards. Her eyes were slight closed with her glossy lips making a small O, as she let out a moan now and then. The other girl was of course quite busy at the moment. Her face was hidden by Karen�s thighs which were now wrapped around the girl�s head. Only the girls highlighted blond hair was visible, which gently raked across Karen�s body. 


Rodney�s hand started moving faster. He imagined he could hear the small slurping sounds the girl�s tongue made as she speedily brought Karan closer and closer to an orgasm. It was at this moment Rodney�s right leg slipped off the make shift foot rest and his chair came crashing backwards. Panicking he grabbed on the wires next to his computer pulling them with him. In the other room the girls heard the sound of metal upon metal, as the camera wire was pulled back and the back end of the hidden camera slammed against the wire-frame of the window. 


Rodney scrambled to get himself up, getting more and more entangled in the wires. He managed to get his chair up, and quickly looked at his screen. The camera feed had gone dark. Someone knocked at his door. Rodney closed his eyes and whispered out loud, �fuck, I�m screwed.�

Chapter 2 � Fuck, I�m really screwed.

Rodney was a bit paralyzed. His reflexes wanted to open the door, but his mind screamed against it. Maybe it�s not them he thought, and then immediately hit himself on the back of his head for being an idiot. The knocks stopped, and Rodney breathed a sigh of relief, until he saw the door knob turning. His vision quickly focused on the lock on the door in the centre of the knob, he had forgotten to screw it in. The door opened with ease and five seconds of pushing the chair that was supposed to give him protection time was on the ground, another failed experiment. 

�Rodney Shaw, you fucking pervert!� screamed Karen the moment she looked at him. 

The evidence was very damning. Wires spewed everywhere, and of course the bulge in his boxers confessed everything. Rodney tried to play dumb. 

�I have no idea what you�re talking about.�

Karen had changed into t-shirt and sweatpants. Her blond lover wore butt-shorts with a halter-top. Rodney could not help but stare at the perfect shapes of their asses. 

The sexy blond walked forward confidently. Rodney was scared for a moment she would slap him. Instead she reached behind him to yank a wire. Rodney closed his eyes and winced expecting to hear the crash of the camera, instead all that came out was the wire. 

�Looking for this?�

She held the black hidden camera in her hand, from the scratches on it, it had suffered much abuse. His cheeks were getting red, and he seemed to have lost his voice. She tossed the camera at his feet, a triumphant look in her eyes. 

�That, that, that isn�t mine,� Rodney stammered like an idiot, �It belongs to James.� 

James was the roommate. Rodney prayed that James would not choose to come into the room at that moment to refute his pathetic assertion. 

�I think we are beyond that, aren�t we Susan?� Karen�s voice was laced with anger.

Susan the blonde nodded her head, �Shall we tell the dormitory staff? Or just call the police and save them the trouble?� 

The color began to drain out of Rodney�s face. His lips and throat were dry and his mind racing. He had never foreseen this happening. He always thought he could lie his way out of anything, it worked through high-school. No one suspected he was responsible for posting naked pictures of the entire cheerleading squad on the internet after the captain publicly humiliated him.  His grades were too good, his reputation impeccable. Thinking about the cheerleading captain brought back his hard-on. 

�This fucking excites you?�

 Susan�s voice was filled with disgust and contempt. But, Karen�s eyes revealed something else, a hint of a glimmer, a soft glow of mischief. She sized Rodney up. Freshman year had been good for him; he had lost most of the fat she remembered he had come in. He looked almost scrawny now, his hair had grown longer, and combined with a few pimples on his face he looked a shadow of adorable, almost doll-like. 

 �Please,� he whispered, �please don�t tell anyone, my college career will be ruined�

�Your college career?� Susan laughed �Your life buster, your life will be over, after they jail you, you will be a perpetual suspect, and put on a list, no one will ever hire you; that is if you survive the trauma of being raped in prison.� 

The mention of prison made Rodney shudder. His hands would not stop shaking, and if his eyes went any wider the balls would have fallen out of their sockets. His feet lost the ability to hold up his weight, and he crumpled slowly to the floor his head in his hands.

�Please,� he whimpered, �please�I�ll do anything.� 

�There is nothing you have or can do that we would ever want.� 

Susan spit on his slumped figure.  Karen all this time was standing, deep in thought. She placed her hand on Susan�s shoulder. 

�Can I talk to you a minute?� 

Overhearing her Rodney looked up to see Susan�s confused face. 

�Don�t you dare move,� she hissed as Karen led her to the corner of the room. 

Once they were out of ear-shot, �Karen, what the hell?� 

�Listen to me for second.� Karen glanced briefly to see if Rodney had moved, he had not. �Think this through for a minute, ideally we should complain about him, and go to the police. But there is a risk that our relationship will be found out, I don�t know about you, but I�m not willing to come out of the closet to parents like this.� 

Susan closed her eyes and bit her lip. �Fuck, I didn�t think about that.� 

�Plus, you know I�m still question,� said Karen, �I�m not willing to commit one way or the other right now.� 

Susan stared long and hard into Karen�s eyes, this was something they had not discussed. 

�So, what do you want to do with him?� 

 �Leave that to me.� 

Karen walked over to Rodney. By this time Rodney was in tears, sure that they were concocting the best way to send him away for life. The glimmer of hope he had felt had been extinguished by his rational brain. Of course they would want me locked up he told himself over and over. 

�Stop sniveling.�

Karen�s harp voice felt like a slap across his face. He looked up his eyes red, and his nose clogged.  She walked over to his computer and opened a new browser window. 

�What is your university user name and password?� 

�What?�

�I won�t ask again, I�ll just call the police from my cellphone, what is your university username and password?�

Rodney trembled as he answered the question. The username and password give Karen access to his entire life. His official e-mail, all his classes, and more importantly every aspect of his university education, with a few clicks she could completely mess up his entire life. 

�rshaw, password, 313475168�

Susan sat down on Jams bed her legs crossed. Rodney could not help but admire the texture of her skin, and the beautiful tan that must have been acquired by hours of sun-bathing. Karen silently entered the details into the website. She was logged in. She let out a laugh, �oh my god, I can�t believe you didn�t change your password, it�s still your social security number!� 

Rodney blinked, and then cursed himself. As a geek he had failed himself, leaving the default password the university had assigned; his social security number. He tried to open his mouth to speak but no words came out. 

�I own you now,� said Karen, �I�ve changed your password, all the little answer questions, and I have your social security number.� 

�Wait, what?�

�Wow, you are so dumb,� Susan piped up, �I wonder how you got into this college? We have your life in our hands, completely and totally. �

Karen smiled at Susan; she had caught on to the plan. 

�Come on, Susan, let�s get out of this pervert�s room.� 

They got up and started towards the door. Karen kicked Rodney in the side for good measure.  He groaned. 

�Wait, are you going to the police?�

Karen turned around, �We haven�t decided yet, but I hope you understand your predicament, one wrong move from you, and I�ll ruin your life.� 

And then she did something that sent chills down Rodney�s spine, she giggled. The last thing he saw were their perfect behinds as they walked out the door. Rodney crumbled to the floor in the fetal position.
