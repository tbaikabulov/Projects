&nbsp; It sure wasnt what I expected, not at all. Having volunteered for the Union, out of Massachusetts, where I had been a seaman on coalers, I wanted to see the organized majestry of war, mid eighteen hundreds. I also wanted to avoid being conscripted under the new law passed earlier this year,1863. There is a thing called being to eager, and I was. Stationed in DC guarding buildings, getting lots of pussy and booze, somehow bored me, if I only knew. That I managed to get a swap to the 16th regiment, Vermont, under Brid Gen George Stannard, started a chain of events that still leaves me pondering the fickle nature of life.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We were heading to Pennsylvania, to reinforce Meades army at a place called Gettysburg, then a nondescript village and farm land. It was late June, 63, I had seen no enemies, except prisoners in DC, all this endless marching was getting to me, like cattle aimlessly roaming. I needed adventure, I missed sailing a full coaler through a northeaster, I was not cut out to be a cow, led here and there. Life on a ship was not great, but it was familiar, this army life was all chaos. There was roughly six thousand men in the Vermont brigrade, maybe one hundred knew what was going on, in any degree. The rest of us just fed on rumors and wishes, as we blindly marched on, heading for God knows what.

&nbsp;&nbsp; Christ, it was all so spread out, that was my reaction as I looked down upon Gettsyburg, its sweeping farm lands, leading to the ridges and mountains to the west. It was something, my reg getting picket duty,loved&nbsp; being out in front, where there was danger, I thought I liked it, be a hero. The rumor was that johnny reb was just south of here and we needed to stop him here or all the north was subject to war. Stannard was at least a man of action, in no time he had the whole brigade strung out across a ridge, Cemetery ridge, not a good omen, bad name, had the men digging and building like maniacs, to be dug in was to be safe, to a degree,so much more confident behind a wall.

&nbsp;&nbsp; It was funny, the whole march everyone kind of went through the motions, but now that we knew there were rebs coming this way, the energy level soared, everyone wanting as much protection as possible. Much better to be behind shelter as the enemy came towards you, as I surveyed the field and rise the enemy would need to cross, I felt good about our chances. They would be coming up a treeless swath of rocky land, making their approach slow and in the open, fuck them, hard to figure if I could make that march.


&nbsp;&nbsp; Fuck yeah, I got a horse detail, sometimes timing is everything, an officer asking for volunteers who rode, headed off to find the enemy pickets, full of myself. There were five of us in the detail, we were all rookies, so it was bound to get fucked up, it did. I was studying the lay of the land, to figure a way back, while following the four riders in front. The suddeness of it all was stunning. Guns blasting from seemingly everywhere. Seeing the guy, riding to my left front, head explode from a rifle shot, was surreal, my instinct was to turn and bolt back to our lines, I did. So much for hero shit, I had the horse galloping, as I lay low on his back, I headed for a little growth of trees. 


&nbsp;&nbsp; Wow, I really had wet myself, that sucked. It was so quick, violent, and quirky, it could easily have been me who got his head blown off. Looking back towards the engagement I took notice of the number of rebs, at least thirty, and saw that all my guys were dead, or captured, so I flew back to camp with the report. It wasnt until I gave my report that someone noticed the blood on the back of my neck, I had been grazed by a bullet and not even known. That really unnerved me, I was already done with this war shit. But the officers had other plans, thats the thing about war, if you do stuff, they want you to do more stuff, if you do nothing, they expect you to do nothing. Fuck, I was noticed, soon as I had a quick meal, I was back out probing for the enemy.



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well early on July first, the enemy showed itself, its whole self. Everyone saw them from the ridge, it was majestic, as they marched forward, thousands and thousands, flags flying, music pounding, dust for miles, they had what seemed like a thousand cannons moving forward. Jesus, we had maybe six thousand able bodies on this ridge, hoped the rebs wouldnt try to overpower us here. Getting a mounted message post was great, I spent the next three days riding behind our lines,out of direct fire, which didnt mean cannon balls were not crashing all around me. The sights and sound of a full scale battle were immense, at one point the whole arena seemed engulfed in smoke, could barely breath, with rebs appearing here and there as they approached our lines, like they were already ghosts. I wondered, again, if I could march across a field like they were, constantly under cannon and rifle fire, watching their comrades go down, at a sickening pace.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Having been back to HQ often, by Sunday, I knew we were on the verge of either victory or defeat, the rebs had only the will for one more charge. That they would waste such quantities of men and horse was staggering, Picketts Charge, was a slaughter. Twelve thousand charged, seventy five hundred died, died for nothing, the rebs were retreating at full speed. Johnny reb had made it to our lines several times, but the cost to him was hideous. To watch cannons, loaded with grapeshot, being fired point blank into the faces of oncoming men was obscene. Mens bodies seemed to rip apart, their limbs and heads, flew in the air, turning the smokey air a dull red, colored with the splattering blood, of the fallen. To look down on that carnage was beyond description, as the sound of the guns silenced, the cries of agony filled the air, I needed room. Fortunatley I was assigned to follow a bunch of fleeing rebs that went west towards Waynesboro, as the command wanted to make sure they went south soon, and not north.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Being relatively fresh, with full rations, ammo, and water, made my job easier, as we crossed Waynesboro, johnny reb swung south through Dogstown, Pa., we kept a safe distance between the reb rear guard and ourselves, no one wanting a fight. But war is messy, as stupid as it seems, we crossed another Union picket, everyone started shooting each other, just outside Hancock, Md. To survive Gettysburg in pretty good shape, just the neck scratch, then have some asshole from my side drill my right bicep was a kick. Thanking my early years on a farm outside Boston, I managed to stay mounted and headed for cover, rode till I reached what I knew to be the Potomac river, there I rested my horse and checked my wound.


&nbsp;&nbsp; The bullet went right through and this was good, but I needed to stave off infection, so I made a mud poultice and bound the arm in cloth. That was it, either it healed or it got infected and I died, such is life. The river water felt great, I risked a naked bath, figuring it would help restore my fatigued body and clean my filthy skin. My cock was hard, I realised it had been a month since I had gotten laid in DC. Wow, it is was good to see my cock was ready to move on, the rest of me wasnt. That night I slept under a cliff on the river, lulled by the gentle sounds of the flowing water. My fire was hidden by the overhang, I ate well, as I caught a fat fish I couldnt identify, but it tasted great, just the same. It would seem to be an ideal place to sleep, but the horrors of the last three days started to flash in my mind, I was a mess of emotions. Joy at surviving was tarnished by the horror of the bodies strewn across the field, the elation of winning was tempered by the sadness of riding by the field hospital and seeing the baskets of amputated arms and legs. War was not majestry, it was ugly and random.

&nbsp;&nbsp; Having gotten several hours of deep sleep, started the day with energy and a clear head, though my right arm was stiff and still throbbing. Cooking oatmeal and a biscuit, I pondered my next move. If I returned to camp, they would send me off on another mission. If I stayed in the field, drifted slowly south, I would be doing my duty, to follow the retreating rebs, all the while relaxing and trying to stay out of harms way.&nbsp; The thunder of the moving rebels was still audible, as well as the dust from the thousands of feet in motion, but I judged them to be at least ten miles ahead,&nbsp; I was sure my guys were right behind them, cattle after cattle, I was in no hurry to join them . My goal was to find a good hideout, so I could get twentyfour hours of rest, my arm was not right, my body needed real rest, a bed for fucks sake.

&nbsp;&nbsp; It was beautiful country I was riding through, green and lush near the river, begging to be cultivated, yet this land was deserted. All the farms were smoldering ruins, the fields stripped, not a soul in site, not even a stray farm animal. There were plenty of dead bodies, rebels, civilians, cows, all just rotting, like as if the devil had come through town, himself. Looking at the mutilated bodies of two young girls, they had been raped and tortured, I recalled this area was split between reb and Union sympathizers. Wow, they had cut off the old mans balls and rested them on his forehead, sick bastards. As I stood pissing on the naked cunt who lay with her legs spread, I figured I wanted to avenge these ladies, and hoped that such a chance I might get. Johnny reb was getting lazy, they left a perfectly good machette buried in the back of the old man.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It seemed like a good idea to head back near the river, as I might pick up a friendly patrol boat and head back up river to camp. Also, I was getting edgy being on the road and near towns, even burnt ones, who knows who is hiding in this confusion, rifle aimed at me, even now. What a way to live,realized these people, who forever made their lives here, were in the middle of a real civil war, neighbor against neighbor. For them this war would never end, they would spend decades avenging past atrocities. That was the thing, how could anyone trust anyone else, it was all so fucking pointless to destroy such naturally fertile lands with years of bloodshed, over niggers. Yeah, not many of us blues cared about that shit, just the jesus freaks. I thought&nbsp; slavery stupid, ultimately self defeating, as I had shipped with many colored mates, the maritime trades were very intregrated, at least north was. The coloreds, for the most part, were like any one else, so I knew that at some point even slaves, would revolt, slaves already outnumbered whites, by three to one, in the south.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The riverside was easy trotting for the horse, soft yet firm grass,made good time, to good time. From years of scanning the horizon for the tiniest hint of land, while at sea, my eyes were strong and true. I saw them first, six walking rebs with sacks of contraband, an obvious pillaging party, guns slung over their shoulders, completly halfassed. Not being a hero, I was not seized with any desire to attack them, but rather I dismounted and went deeper into the brush along the river, so as to spot a chance for some easy marks.Shit, they were heading right towards me, then I noticed the shed twentyfive feet ahead of me, they slanted that way as they approached the river. Mentally, I Knew I had my rifle, good for one shot, my pistols five each, and I longed to use the machette.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My body was doing, my mind was watching, thats what it felt like, as I silently crept upon the six rebs, who should of at least posted a watch, lazy bastards. They were awful interested in what was in the shed, decided to just use the pistols. I had fired three shots each, before they started to get what was happening. Not a one of them got off a shot,&nbsp; as I went a round looking at them I was excited at the violence, no doubt about it. It bothered me, but I was consumed by it, loved that four of the rebs were stone dead, two with head shots, thats good shooting. Two were breathing, the nearest,a fat bastard was spurting blood from a gut shot. He wasnt even trying to get to his gun, mere feet away, I felt loathing for his giving up, quickly ended his ride with a head shot. 

&nbsp; The last survivor, was a fucking kid, I mean fifteen or so, skinny, dirty, with a bad thigh shot, he was bleeding out, slowly. Dragging the dead rebs behind the shed, I looked in and laughed at what drew them in, they had found a hidden cellar full of smoked hams, booze, and gold pieces. Hell yeah, this could be a real good thing, if I could conceal the money, but gold is heavy. Burrying most of it near a bend in the river, I kept enough to help me out, packed a few hams, and some booze onto my horse, and stripped the reb who was my size and put his uniform in my pack, just in case I needed to switch sides quick, wasnt afraid to adapt. Their guns were all shit, threw the bodies into the cellar and went and got the kid, who was crying and pleading to live, not likely. I stripped him roughly, he had a hairless feminine body, I was horny, we worked it out, I raped him. I took him over a nearby downed tree and he was tight and fiesty. I rutted him with anger and violence, savoring his cries. When I dug my fingers into his thigh wound, in and out roughly, his ass muscles massaged my cock to a thundering climax. I threw the used kid into the hole as well, alive, setting the shed on fire, I started south down the river quickly, to avoid any reb search parties, feeling like I did both my country, and myself, a great service.

&nbsp; 
Sometime you just know what to do, like today, as I was riding south. It came to me to climb a nearby oak that had to be one hundred feet high, my years climbing ships rigging paying off. The view was wide and far, was glad my hunch paid off. There was a town about a mile ahead and I could see that the whole reb army had stopped there. There were reb picket, scouting, and pillaging parties everywhere. Shit, I needed distance,&nbsp; as I looked across the Potomac, I saw no people, only a small, quiet farm up a long road from the river, a road that was not very visable as you walked past it, sensed a place to lay low while johnny reb makes up his mind. But how to cross, I could see no fordes nearby, the current was strong enough,there was no doubt that I could swim it, but I hated to lose the horse, or the hams and booze. Taking another look at the enemy, they were all on this side, and appeared to have no attention of crossing as that would put them back into Pa. One last look about from my lofty perch, rewarded me with the sight of a large Union army heading straight for the rebs, who were all moving in different directions, having seen the union armys approach. 


&nbsp; They had time, though, the blues were noisy as thousands tend to be, and the rebs were moving fast straight south and the Union army was veering southeast, so as to stay on johnny rebs tail, but allow room to change direction. So I climbed down the tree, with the expectation that there would be no battles, and I only had to find a way across the river,decided to rig a guidon to lead the horse over, something that required four trips across the water for me, so I was tired when I finally secured the horse, led him across the water, his bucking to a minimun. It was worth it, better to have a horse and lose it later, than never to have had one, what. Now I needed to go on foot though, so I hobbled the horse near water and good grazing, headed silently up towards the quiet farm. The barn was first and it was small, with a little hay loft and just two stalls, both empty. Climbing in a window, I scouted it out, it was empty,&nbsp; the stalls contained no fresh manure. Looking out the loft I spotted the kid running towards the house, about thirteen, carrying a rifle. The door was opened by a woman, saw at least one other person behind her, to do this would be dicey, to say the least.


&nbsp; Figuring night would be best, I decided to head back and bring the horse up to the barn, and I did with no trouble, though a Union patrol boat passed within feet of the horse, causing it to whinney, the morons never even heard it, damn glad Im not relying on them. Smiling, I never considered flagging down the boat, I realised I wanted to find out what goodies were in that cabin. I was horny, needed some baser fun, that reb cunts were made for. Of course if they were Union folks, I knew I would still have my way, war truly, was hell. The approach to the barn was concealed from the house,&nbsp; I put the horse in the stall with water and some oats, prepared to assault the house. It was sunset,&nbsp; I could see the smoke from the chimney, the light from the fire, through the rough hewed shutters, covering the windows. Feeling the pain in my arm, got me pumped that I needed to do this as quickly as possible. prayed the sun down

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the end

&nbsp;&nbsp; 



&nbsp;&nbsp; Seeing no sally ports, I quickly was on the porch, against the door frame. Using a pistol butt I knocked loudly, told them I meant no harm, I was a wounded soldier, who would trade a smoked ham for a nights sleep. They must of been hungry, they didnt even ask which side, maybe my accent told them, I was a yank, but they all came out. The mother was skinny, dirty, missing most of her teeth, she had one daughter, also skinny, but good looking, early teens, the boy I had seen earlier, sans gun. Quikcly I asked mom where the gun was, she got, while I kept the kids under my eye, or pistol. She explained her son was hunting squirrel, when he saw me and ran to the cabin. I ordered the boy and the girl to get my saddlebags, containing the hams and booze, led Mattie, thats was her name, into the small, dirty one room square. Jesus, they all slept&nbsp; side by side, that boy must be tapping some of that pussy. She admitted they were rebs, before the children returned offered herself for their safety. When I calmly imformed her that I planned on sampling all their wares, she didnt seem surprised, I figured her life must be dreary.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She was stunned staring at the four fat hams at her feet, enough food to feed them for weeks. When I told her I would be here two days, the food was hers, she wept and I felt guilty,a little. They hadnt had any steady food, just an occasional fish or squirrel, the kids were getting sicker more often. She did have potatoes and mustard greens, which I hated, but knew I needed the vegetables. There was no milk for the kids, I knew how to fix that, as I had seen cows that the scurrying rebs had set free, roaming down by the river, under the cover of trees,cows tended to stay near water and grass. After everyone ate, I had them all do their business together, behind the cabin. The light from the fire let me see two hairy fat cunts, one nice six inch cock on the boy. Mom was put out by this humiliation, but I laid the security shit on her. Next I tied up the cunts, while copping some nice feels, me and sonny headed to the river.

&nbsp;&nbsp; He was a fast learner, in no time we had roped two milkers and a stray horse, junior was happy enough that they had milk and a working horse.&nbsp; I climbed a nearby tree and to my distraction saw all the fires, for miles, as the two sides had decided to sit tight and fight it out in the morning, the battle field being about five miles west of here. Shit I needed to lay low, I didnt want to fight anymore, fuck that. Mattie was all toothless smiles at the cows and I knew I was getting some reb cunt soon. I untied the mother and had here help the boy hide the livestock in the suddenly crowded barn, meanwhile I got the young cunt, about fifteen to her feet, roughly stripped her, as she sobbed and blabbered. Nice little body, titties fat and sweet tasting, ass smooth, a fat wet cunt,as I fingered her, she moaned like a true piggy. Her cunt taste on my finger was sweet and heady, I was going to enjoy this young thing. Roughly I rammed my tongue down her throat, while one hand assaulted her tits, the other sawed fingers in and out of her fast wettening cunt. She would submit to me, so I untied her and told her to start heating a ham up, she was cooking naked when mom and junoir returned. He was bugeyed at his naked sister, from the bulge, more than a little horny,Mattie was not pissed, I detected a sly smile, like she dug the wildness.

&nbsp;&nbsp; Giving Devin, that was junoirs name, a pistol, I told him to make a sweep of the property down to the river, then check on the animals, and return here. He seemed like he wanted to please, thats always a good thing, he could easily have been a pain in the ass, but I think hunger cowers people to a degree. While he was gone I got Mattie down to bare skin and she was pretty used up, sagging tits, stomach stretched, legs veiny and hairy. Still she had a look of excitement in her eyes, that spelled fun and as I kissed her, she responded with ardor, that had to be real. Christ, her cunt was loose, but she was wet and ready and I took her on the table, as her daughter watched intently, not at all discreetly. It was great to be riding a cunt again, it didnt take long to cum, she seemed in the same way, as she moaned out a deep orgasm of her own. That she wasnt flustered was very nice, she went and helped her kid prepare their first real dinner in months, I got my tobacco, headed to the porch, to look for the boy. 


&nbsp;&nbsp; As I scanned the moonlit surroundings, I laughed at the luck I had stumbled into, knew I needed to stay on guard, as we were so close to so many troops, I didnt want anyone, even blues, disturbing my coming night. Devin was heading this way, sticking to the shadows, I saw him, Im good, the kid had potential though. When he got to the porch, his words were rapid fire, but I heard&nbsp; soldiers and this side, that was enough. Shaking him got him calm, he told me he saw two rebel guys, sitting by the river, that they looked like they were camping there. After telling him he did good, which he ate up, We went in the house, I laid down the law, as I made it.

&nbsp;&nbsp; Mattie and Sarah, the daughter, would stay in the cabin, with the rifles, loaded and ready. Devin and I would deal with the rebs, any doubts I had about Mattie turning on her fellow rebs, were dispelled by her telling me, the greys would rape and pillage, same as the blues, she hated it all, and trusted no one. She did admit that she trusted me,&nbsp; was willing to put her family in my hands, the kids agreed to obey me. I also learned their hubby and father was dead, nothing wild, just maleria, from the swamps of South Carolina, where he had served the Confederate army. So after a quick feel of mom and daughter, and encouraging Devin to sample both the women, which he did with gusto, by the sound of his sisters moans, his mothers lusty groans of encouragement, we headed for the river, using stealth and Devins familiarity with the land to get within feet of the clowns.


&nbsp;&nbsp; They were drunk, didnt anyone care that there was a war going on. So much noise were they making, that we would of had to shout to get their attention, which we didnt do, of course. With discreet hand signals, I directed Devin behind the loser sitting on his bed roll, while I took aim at the guy standing and pacing. With the drop of my hand we both shot, I got the desired head shot and the pig tumbled into the river, bye bye. Devin had been only feet away when he shot, but his pistol jerked, the shot was embedded in the whining rebs shoulder, who made no effort to fight back, simply put his hands up. Jesus, what a coward, did he really think I was going to let him live, didnt he notice my blues. Thinking Devin would spare him, I asked the kid what we should do with the tresspasser. Fuck, he surprised me, the little bastard emptied the last five shots into the now very dead grey. It felt good, as me and Devin pissed on the dead fucker, I told him that he was now a man, when we got back I expected him to make Sarah a woman. I thought he was going to run to the cabin, but I set him straight, on man duties, always protect your pussy.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We took the very holey rebs boots, brand new, and their packs and blankets, and even their rifles, which were newer enfields, very nice, reliable. Devin wanted to see his wounds before we tossed the body in the river, and I was impressed, once the kid felt the guns pull, his last three shots were all head hits. Natural born killer, for sure. We stripped the loser, I showed Devin how easily a guys cock and balls came off, my knife cleanly removing johnnys privates. When I stuffed them in the dead fuckers mouth, Devin was excited, good, the kid was nasty. Nice, that he again kept to the shadows, even as he tried to contain his sexual lust at having at his older sister.


&nbsp;&nbsp; It was fun watching Devin get down with Sarah, while Mattie stroked and sucked my throbbing eight inches, she watched her kids lose their cherrries to each other, thats a family moment, if ever there was one. Sarah had to guide the overexuberant boy, he only lasted minutes, leaving Sarah hanging, on the verge. I quickly opened her cunt up with a series of savage thrusts, Sarah was screaming with joy in no time, clinging to my sweaty body for all her worth. When I got off her, Mattie was all smiles, she sucked me clean, then sucked her sons six inches clean, that was nice. Sarah just lay there cooing, and ahhing, legs still spread, obscenely. As I wanted to clean up, I ordered the gang to the river, but Mattie talked me into a different deal,&nbsp; I followed her inland, was rewarded with a small pond, perfect for a relaxing swim. 

&nbsp; The kids were having fun, grabassing naked, while Mattie removed my bandage, declared my arm pinking, healing. She also said she had some alcohol, which would further clean the scabbing wounds. The water felt great and when Mattie locked her legs around my waist, and directed my cock into her cunt, I was happy. Devin was in Sarah again, we all had a nice release, as the water cleaned us. Back at the cabin, I stressed the need for vigilance, we secured the doors and windows, we all bedded down, naked, side by side. This was turning out to be a great war for me. Woke once all night, when Mattie got up to piss, I went with her to the outhouse, for safety. We made out afterwards, it felt great to be naked with this happy woman, she had so many reasons to be bitter, but she wasnt, that was very satisfying to me, on some level.


&nbsp; Mattie was up before me, tending the fire, cooking ham, and making biscuits, as I watched her, still naked, I felt a weird longing to stay here forever, that was shocking. I never considered being a farmer in West Virginia, high on my list of things to do. I mean the name of the nearest town was Doe Gully, this was backwoods, but I was very content, for now at least. Giving Mattie a big hug and kiss, I went and did my morning business, also walked the property,&nbsp; felt everything was secure, though I could hear the two armies umlimbering their war machines. The kids were up and after they did there businesss, we all had a large, filling breakfast, there was much laughter, as we all sat naked eating and grabbing each other.


&nbsp;&nbsp; The thing is though, lots of shit had to be done, in order to get this place right. First I had the ladies alter Matties dead hubbys clothes to fit me, so my choice of sides was iffy, while I gave Devin more training on the guns, how to load, and also how to clean them. When we were all dressed, I sent the kids to scout the property for any tresspassers, then they were to lead the animals out to the pasture land, I saw inland as we walked to the pond last night. Mattie told me there was a plow in the barn, the kids would bring that to the field as well. There was seeds for corn, potatoes, greens, and watermellon, in the barn as well. It was to late to plant this year, as it was July, but the field could be tilled and cleared for the spring, we would need to agressively fish and hunt to get a full winter larder. Feeling confident we could survive winter on fruit, meat, and fish, I was again shocked at my quickening acceptance of this new life.



&nbsp;&nbsp; As Mattie told me more, I learned there were apple trees on the property, as well as peach and cherrie trees, also blueberries and strawberries, so there was food to live on, how fertile this land was, she had a grind wheel to make corn meal and when available, wheat flour, made things easier. When I mentioned we needed a bull and chickens, she told me about the family that farmed about two miles inland. They were yank sympathizers, they had been part of a band that raped and killed Matties sister and beat Her two little nephews to death, after looting and burning the farm. This had to be avenged, Mattie was all for it, asking to be allowed to get the husband, a request I had no problem with, at all. She told me in gruesome detail her and the kids finding the bodies,how mangled the kids bodies had been, how her sister had been left naked, legs spread, and her cunt cut out. Wow, this was one great little community, hello neighbor, my ass.


&nbsp;&nbsp; The kids met us, leading our growing livestock, two milkers, a draft horse,&nbsp; my horse, which I let roam the fields, while Mattie had managed to get one of the cows teats to start shooting milk, we all got some fresh milk. Devin loved tp scout, came back to report&nbsp; he climbed an oak and the armies were forming up across an open field, with the rebels moving directly south, the yanks again, heading southeast, I knew Meade needed to be able to cover DC as well as the retreating reb mob. That he saw no one within a mile of us, was easing, as we needed time to take care of the Mansfields, that was the name of the butchers who killed Matties family.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Revenge is good, but I wanted their livestock and any other valuables, you know, food, tools, firewood, cloth, things the winter required you to get now. Honestly, I did not know how Mattie could survive next winter, she told me they had planted some corn, but confederates ripped up and ate the green corn, then she just hid with the kids, to afraid to even pick apples as the fuckers had raped her, while Devin had to watch, but he had hidden Sarah down their barely functioning well, another project needed to be done now, as it was caving in, and walikng to the river to get water was not an option.



&nbsp; My respect for Devin was growing, I knew I would be happy to have him as my son, Sarah as my daughter, then the funny picture, of Mattie and Sarah pregnant with my seed, that was deep. As we closed in on our target, my mind was total focus. The Mansfields had a father, mother, teenage son and young daughter at home, two sons were fightng for the Union. They also had four slaves, two males and two females, go figure, seeing they were fighting to free their own niggers. We needed a diversion, as we looked down on the farm from a low ridge, I guessed they were all having a late breakfast, except the two nigs who were trying, unsuccessfully, to shoe a draft horse, beside a spacious barn, they were not blacksmiths, just black. 


&nbsp; Deciding to act, I knew it had to be now, while they were together, so I had Mattie and Sarah go round the barn and distract the nigs without noise, while Devin and I assaulted the house. Mattie and Sarah each carried primed enfields, Mattie assured me they would use their bodies to distract the coloreds,&nbsp; she and Sarah flashed their tits at us, I loved that wild woman. When they left, I felt sadness at their going, but needed all my attention, to take this house clean, I wanted everyone alive, till I sorted who was who. Devin carried a springfield over his shoulder,&nbsp; both colt revolvers, ready with six shots each. I had a springfield, both of my colts,&nbsp; the machette through my belt. We were as ready as ever,&nbsp; I told Devin I was kicking in the door and we would head to different ends of the kitchen, those trembles of fear, maybe they saw us, were waiting, fought through it, always fight through it.


&nbsp; The fuckers were sure surprised, seeing they had killed many neighbors, I would think they would post watches, it was amazing how people fooled themselves. It took no time to get everyone on the same page, led them out of the house, I sensed they hoped we were just robbers, well we would rob them, but that was the least of these fuckers problems. I used my rifle stock to smash the father in the back, sending him face first into the dirt, Devin drilled the son, about sixteen, with his rifle, the guys were down and begging us to take their food and gold. The wife was fat, but cute, with huge tits, I wanted to treat her nasty, she looked pompous to me. The girl was ten or eleven,&nbsp; I knew we would take her with us, as I had a plan forming in my devious mind, something to do with me starting my own settlement, based on my word, loyalty to each other, only, fuck the north and south.


&nbsp; We had the guys legs and arms firmly tied, ordered the mother and daughter to start bringing valuables out of the house. The pig actually ordered one of the nigger wenches to do it. The slap sounded like a rifle, I hit the slag so hard, the feel pf my palm crashing her fat mug, awesome. She just dropped, out cold. Devin kept saying wow, wow, I guess he was impressed. The father started talking up a storm,&nbsp; Devin used his rifle to smash daddys teeth in, I was impressed and told Devin to give the son a shot,&nbsp; both fuckers were spitting teeth, babbling fools.
&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Checking out the niggers, one was good looking, big tits, fat ass, coal black, young, maybe twenty,&nbsp; I wanted her for the farm, so I tied her to the nearby hitching post and told her to stay still and she would live. The other looked old and weak , I ordered her to take the daughter and begin bringing out the valuables. It looked like the father and son eyes would bug out as they saw Mattie and Sarah leading the two stud coons over to us. They knew this was about vengence,&nbsp; they struggled, me and Devin used our boots to stomp them silly, till they lay there, bloody and panting. Mattie was taunting them, that she would be much more nasty to his kids than he was to her sisters. Jesus, the fucker begged, like we would stop if he asked us nicely. No, this had to be done, Mattie and her kids needed this to get on with it. Theres no way they could be normal knowing a few miles down the road lived the family that smashed their relatives heads in.


&nbsp;&nbsp; With the help of the men slaves we had the Mansfield men tied, standing up, I had Sarah and Mattie cut their clothes off, while I made a quick survey of the grounds in case of company. Devin was helping the groggy cow up, as she got up, she started to yell at me, so I used my fist, from the blood splattering, figured I broke her nose. The cunt was out cold again, this was getting tedious.&nbsp; Mattie gave me a huge wet toothless kiss, I liked it, liked its passion, its baseness, yet her tongue was sweet, twirling in my mouth. Sarah laughed out that the son had a tiny penis and we all spent time teasing the coward, as he cried, his father pleaded. His cock wasnt much better, Devins was larger, a fact Mattie pointed out to the father with pride, while promising him that her son would take his daughters cherry soon. 


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First though, I wanted to fuck with the cow, so I told the two dark bucks that if they raped the boss lady, I would set them free, they needed no second choice, the fuckers had clubs for cocks, they used all the anger inside their pitiful souls, to strip and ravage the screaming cow, as her husband pleaded some more, though the coons were lost in white cuntville, they were not stopping for anything, Their cocks were pistoning in and out of her fat cunt and ass at a comically fast pace,&nbsp; the cow was making the sweetest noises, like she had logs running up her fat holes, she did. Mattie was egging the coons on and telling the father that his wife was gonna have nigger twins. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sarah meanwhile pointed out that junior had a little willy, watching his cow mother get nigger raped in the dirt. So, I told Sarah to stroke the losers little willy till he was ready to cum, then I whispered in her ear, she used the knife I passed her to remove the fuckers balls, as we cheered and he squealed as he shot his last load, ever. God, the way Sarah brutally sawed his balls off, she was stunning in her beauty&nbsp; Mattie used a shovel to stove the sackless sons head in and told the father pay back sucked, she then stuffed juniors bloody balls into the old mans bloody toothless piehole, that was fucking hot, dont fuck with Mattie. The kids brains were dripping out of his cracked skull, the father had his sons nuts half in his broken mouth,&nbsp; I again felt love for Mattie, her ability to explode with violence. The bucks had finished sliming the babbling bleeding pig, we all had to get a look at piggys still gaping cunt,&nbsp; wide open shit chute, both of them dripping nig cum and blood. The darkies were still kind of leery of getting white pussy, so I told them they owed me some work for the cunt ride, I had them do what the lived to do, work, bring me the livestock,&nbsp; farm tools, in the barn, pile them near the two wagons.

&nbsp;&nbsp; Mattie was in a frenzy so I told her and Sarah to beat the pig to death, they were nasty, dragging it out, spending way to much time kicking her cunt into a raw bleeding mess. Jesus, I heard the pigs pelvic bones snapping from the violent stomp assault. But when Mattie grabbed one fat tit, and Sarah the other,&nbsp; they started to stab the fat orbs with the small knives they carried, I was horny as all get out, as I looked at Devin, he smiled and rubbed his crotch, as if to agree.&nbsp; The ladies each used shovels to pummel the sobbing cow till she was dead, me and Devin pissed on her, a ritual we both liked. Sarah and Mattie joined in, I had to laugh as I watched the half mad father staring at the lunatics pissing on his dead wife,&nbsp; the little sister was staring at the sight of her dead mom and brother, as she carried her familys stuff out of the house, for our use, losers and winners.



&nbsp;&nbsp; We all knew it was time to send the fucker on his way, I gave Devin the honor of avenging his Mother, he used my machette to chop the fucker up, slowly and painfully. first cutting open the fuckers chest with a series of bloody, but not deep, stripes. He got the assholes arms and legs off, before the fucker had a massive stroke, gurgled his last. Im telling you, this kid is a natural, he had the Mansfields blood all over him. Mattie was beaming with pride, Sarah gave him a deep soulful kiss and cock rub,promises of lots of pussy, this is family life at its best.


&nbsp; The pile of loot was impressive, we loaded two wagons, with stuff ranging from food and alcohol, to tools, wood,nails, hay, cloth, sugar, and lots of clothes. Their guns were impressive, to bad they were to lazy to use them, we now had quite an arsenal, including a small six pound cannon, complete with thirty balls, and charges, how fuck cool is that. The livestock included chickens and roosters, a bull, several cows, three pigs, two more draft horses, three riding horses. We organized two trips, before we had enough food and stuff to make it through winter, without much need to leave the site. When we loaded for the last trip, Me and Devin quickly executed the two nigger men, Mattie shot the ugly coon to death, though she purposely wounded her several times, wanting to see her suffer, I dug that shit. Mattie wanted to save the darkies cocks and balls,&nbsp; I loved watching her and Sarah, hack the fuckers up, it was all so natural.&nbsp; We piled the bodies in the hay barn,&nbsp; after everyone was gone, Devin and Sarah set all the buildings afire and hurried to meet us at the farm. All in all, it was a completely successful raid, the family got revenge, we also stocked our larder well, meaning this winter we could all lay low, avoid marauders of all stripes, fuck our brains out, thats the army life for me

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the end.










&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Davis Farm
&nbsp;&nbsp; Chapter 3&nbsp; Hibernation

.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp; The next few months were relatively quiet, we used this time to get the farm prepped for winter and next spring. The well was easy as it just needed shoring up, the water was clean and below the frost line, so we would have year round water, within feet of the back door. Me and Devin completed an eight foot by eight foot addition, with another fire place to use as a larger kitchen, we let the nigger, Uma, sleep there. She was broken by the girls,&nbsp; would do whatever we wanted,&nbsp; everyone used her sexually, she had started to like it, which made everyone easier on her, the cunt was smart enough to digest that fact. She became like a member of the clan, we only beat her sexually,&nbsp; the rest of the time she did her shit, we were all decent to her. So we had someone to do all the cooking, laundry, inside cleaning, freeing Mattie and Sarah for help with building the barn addition, as we needed to have housing for the animals before winter,&nbsp; store enough hay and corn to feed them. Devin and I had made several runs to the Mansfields to get hay and corn feed.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The barn was great, we even finished a seperate tool shed, for our growing farm,&nbsp; a chicken coop, that was attached to the new kitchen. We dug the ice cellar under the new kitchen, alongside a granite ledge, it was dry and cold, perfect to store our perishables. We renamed the little girl Sally, after Matties sister, she became Devins cunt, not that I didnt fuck her now and then, but she was useful and that was real good. She was an expert sewer, Mattie put her to work sewing us all new clothes, something we all needed badly. There still seemed like a clock was ticking, remindin gme that we were still defenseless against a group, we needed everyone to be trained, Uma taking to it wih gusto, imagine she dreams of killing whitey , Sally was determined, two hands with the pistol she was dead on, more important, she would shoot, smile while she did it. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We began the habit of all gathering around the fireplace, at the end of a long work day, all of us, even Uma, had an orgy of sexual pleasure that left everyone sated and sleepy, no bickering in this crowded house, no tension. To me and Devins pride, Mattie, Sarah, and Uma were pregnant, Sally wasnt only because she hadnt bled yet, Devin was determined to fire first shot in pregging her, that seemed right. There were gonna be some fat piggies to play with all winter long. The nigger wench, was a delight to fuck, as she became accustomed to our pervertedness, she began servicing the girls to,&nbsp; Devin and I loved to sit back and have Sally play with our man meats, while the ladies got nasty for us. Mattie surprised us by pulling out the nigger cocks and balls, she had taken from the slaves, she had stuffed them with sand, and then pickled them till they were hard, like real cocks. They used these on Uma and themselves, with great effect, judging from the shouts of joy, moans of pleasure, the flames adding to the eroticism.





&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The drudgery of standing watch, any sailors dread, but we all understood the need, storms, enemies, whatever, the kids didnt like hanging in the oak tree for hours on end, they spotted several union scouting parties nearby, on the otherside of the Potomac, lesson learned. Me and Devin spent all of November hunting, managing to bag several deers, a dozen wild turkeys, lots of rabbits and squirrels. It was nice to see so much wild life, I knew we could survive just by hunting, if need be. More importantly I now knew the lay of the land for miles around,&nbsp; realised what an ideal spot the farm was on. The river in front, an effort to cross, one side leading into a&nbsp; thick tangle of thorns and brush, like a wall of thorns, the otherside into a unpassable swamp, the back leading to the closest farm, the Mansfield place, two miles away, we could defend our place, I felt, at least make a stand. Me and Devin also set up hidden caches of food, water, and weapons, at different locations around the farm, made sure the girls knew of them, as it could be life and death. I had everyone spend one hour every day training with firearms, and proper watch duty. Devin started taking Sarah with him to teach her how to stay hidden, while out and about, she was as natural as her baby brother, they would see how close to the cabin they could slink, everytime, they got closer before I spotted them, they knew it was all how you pictured yourself, nice.



&nbsp; Mattie and Sarah spent time dragging the nets I rigged for them along the Potomac, gathering lots of catfish and river trout, which Uma expertly smoked and stored in the cellar,along with the venison, and smoked turkey.We all spent time picking apples, peaches, blueberries, and strawberries, for preserves, pies, and to freeze in the root cellar. Between Mattie, Sarah, and Uma, we had lots of great cooked food. Even little Sally could cook, knew how to pluck, prep a turkey. We men, me and Devin hunted, women cooked, real reason was better for man to be outside, ready to defend his homestead, thats my theory, I mean I can cook, not well, but I never died. The important thing was everyone was growing into their roles, there was harmony, peace, even a little joy, not bad for living on a battle field.. 

&nbsp; Before the first snow fell we had all gone back to the Mansfield place to see what else we could use, Mattie driving a wagon, Uma the other, the rest of us walking to the sides, just in case. It was Matties idea, take the whole back addition to the main house which hadnt burnt, a fifteen foot square, clapboard room, We were busy beavers, but had the thing in pieces and on the wagons, even the fireplace, stone by stone in short time. Sarah and Sally also got all the rest of the goods, flour, sugar, etc, out of the burnt house. Devin found the pile of lead and gun powder, and this was real nice. We also found a couple of cords of cut, seasoned firewood, this made winter alot easier, no one enjoys the daily grind of chopping wood, remember the kitchen fireplace was burning constantly,&nbsp; the great room fire was roaring all winter, thats a shit load of wood. Figuring the new addition would be a nice project for the winter, we headed back to our place, tired, but happy and horny,&nbsp; we all teased each other about how much fucking was going to happen later, honest hard work got us all hot and bothered . 


&nbsp;&nbsp; It was fun to just be in a pile of&nbsp; like minded perverts, I was quite content to watch the wildness that surrounded me. Devin was fucking his mom doggy style, while she ate Umas fat black cunt. Sarah was sitting on Umas face, grinding her pink young cunt all over the sloppy niggers face. Little Sally was grinding her bare, tiny pussy into Sarahs willing face, it was a beautiful scene, I never wanted to leave the cabin, ever. When they had all cum, I lined the girls up, on their hands and knees, I went down the row, plowing each of their shit holes hard and deep, while slapping the array of asses at my disposal. Wow,Sally was tight, but she took her analing without whining, in fact, she seemed very into it, the girls egged her on, she was throwing her tiny eleven year old ass at me, it was hot, my cum exploded deep in her colon,&nbsp; I collapse on the panting girl, locking her in a tender embrace.

&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On christmas day we experienced six inches of snow and the beginning of a week of frigid tempertures, we all spent much time huddled in front of the fire, which was a great way to spend the day, me and Devin and three pregged out cunts, and little Sally, wanting everybodies attention. We had the addition all done, only needed to build a fireplace on its back wall, so our compound was getting bigger, we could accomadate several more people, something me and Mattie discussed often, We knew there was safety in numbers.Thats the thing about a civil war, it aint. There were so many rougue soldiers on either side, as well as plain old robbers, that it was only a matter of time before we would need to defend ourselves, we needed more men, women, who could and would fight. Right now, with the weather freezing, we supposed everyone was lying low, so we redoubled our efforts on security. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Everyone helped to build the stone turret, fifteen feet high, attached to the side of the main house. We even got the six pounder secured on the top and it could be swiveled for a 360 range of fire. Whoever manned the cannon would also be protected by the stone wall. The cannon was true and we soon could hit within ten feet of any target up to 100 yards away, enough to sweep the bend of the river, perfect to nail unsuspecting boats. We also completely concealed the road to the river with brush, so the farm was invisible, except where the turret showed, and that blended into the trees so well that I felt we had done as much as we could, in securing the property.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mid febuary, when the freeze was still gripping the west Virginia area, the river froze, so Devin and I decided to ride across and head to find my buried gold coins and see if we could get word of where the armies went off to. Wow, the town of Doe Gulley is, I mean was small. When the union army marched through this past summer, they burnt the town down, all seventeen farms and houses, were gone, the only standing building was the white clapboard church, though the steeple had been sheered of by an errant shell. There was a fire burning in the fireplace, so we decided to investigate.

&nbsp;&nbsp; The thirty or forty people crammed in the church, were dirty, starving, near mad. The reverand told us the women had been gangraped, even the young girls, most of the men and boys killed, the rest beaten and some of the boys raped also. I am a son of bitch, as my first thought was slave laborers, next, fresh cunt,&nbsp; from the look of lust on Devins face, he seemed to be thinking along those lines. We simply took who we wanted, they were beaten, given up, human trash, sad, but true. There were seven in all, one woman, two teen girls, and four boys aged twelve through fifteen. As soon as we were away from the town, heading to the farm, we tied our slaves, hands in front, everyones neck tied together, rope held by me, one yank of the rope,&nbsp; they would all fall and strangle. I knew my shit, wanted these fuckers to be problem free,&nbsp; I didnt even inspect them, much, as Devin and I needed to ever be ready for shit, I loved that the kid wasnt distracted by all the new cunt, he knew the deal, safety first, then fun.


&nbsp;&nbsp; That we made it unchallenged had more to do with the cold and snow, realised we were lucky all the new meat survived the ten mile march, though they were all sleeping standing up, as we marched into the barn, first to house the horses. Sarah&nbsp; met us at the rivers edge,&nbsp; that was nice, that she was out scouting, even in the cold, good shit, she was excited at the new comers. Everyone gathered around the captives,&nbsp; for the first time I studied them closely, as Mattie and the others removed the petrified peoples clothes, Devin untied the Woman and brought her to me, as I sat at the table, sipping warm cider, little Sally, tenderly removing my boots.

&nbsp; She was ample, big fat tits, fat belly, hairy cunted, her body had many cuts and bruises,&nbsp; I had her tell us what had happened to them. The yankees rounded up the whole town, right away gunned down all the able bodied men,&nbsp; then the raping and beatings started, it lasted for two days before rebels attacked the union thugs, the fuckers fled,&nbsp; the rebs took off after them, the survivors tried to protect what was left of their children. What the fuck I wasnt a complete savage, so with Mattie coaxing me, It was decided that they would be accepted as members if they learned the rules and fit in. This could be good, we needed more people to fight any sustained attack, listening to Gloria, that was her name, story, put me on edge. There were bands of savages, north and south, roaming the country, raping, pillaging, murdering, I wanted to be sure we could at least put up a fight.



&nbsp; I sent Gloria off with Mattie, so she could eat and learn about her duties, also where she could sleep. Next up were the two girls, Mary, thirteen, blonde, tiny tits, sparse blonde cunt hair, perfect tiny ass, long fine legs, she was beautiful, but was obviously hurting emotionally, as she couldnt speak, Gloria explained that after being raped reapetedly, Mary stopped talking. As I felt her sweet little nubs, she showed no emotion, just looked at me with dead, empty blue eyes, I knew Mattie would have to bring this damaged girl back from where ever she had gone to. She went with Mattie and Sally, with all the animation of a dead person, maybe she was.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Franny, was next, fifteen, dark haired, lots of bush, sweet swinging, fat tits, with gumdrop nipples, chubby butt, lots of bruises, her tits were black and blue. But she was alive and told me she wanted to live, as I told her what went on here, she only asked, no begged, that we didnt hurt her anymore,&nbsp; I told her that was up to her. When Fran got on her knees and took my cock out,&nbsp; started sucking like a cheap sea tavern whore, I was in love,&nbsp; as I noticed Devins look of awe, so was he. Franny did me till I unloaded deep down her throat, she was great,&nbsp; telling her this, brought out her stunning smile,&nbsp; I knew Fran would be no trouble at all. I sent her with Sarah, to eat and get&nbsp; some well deserved sleep, though I had her suck Devin off also, as he earned it, he was perfect on our little raid earlier,&nbsp; I kept forgetting that the fucker was only thirteen.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fran had told me that the boys were all brothers, and the only reason they lived was that their father and mother aided the union soldiers, in finding hiding women and children. I had to laugh when she revealed that the union bastards killed their father anyways, then fucked the mother to death. Well we had four boy slaves, as I decided to not even deal with these fuckers tonight, instead me and Devin fed the boys slop, they ate off the floor, and we tied them, all naked, together in a corner, let them sleep, or worry, while we crashed for the night, it had been a tension filled twentyfour hours. 


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mattie slept with me,and she made slow love to me, and I could hear Devin and Sally, going at it, with passion, the soft moanings of Sarah and Fran, were all pushing me to a higher level of pleasure. Uma was in the kitchen, gently singing to, carassing, the broken Mary, at one point I heard the girl speak the words thank you, I realised how sweet Uma was, she might be a slave, but she had more humanness than most of the fucking bitter bastards around here, most of whom I was now realizing had never worked hard, a day in their lives, they always had slaves to do any chore, wow, sounds nice, but it would make any man soft and lazy. I came from hard yankee stock, we were born to toil, I enjoyed working the land as much as I enjoyed our growing sex parties at night, it was a great way to spend a day, work hard and true, then fuck the night away.&nbsp; 


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the end
