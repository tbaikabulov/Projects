Suzanne�s
Return

Part I

By: R.J. Silverwood

(rj_silverwood@hotmail.com)

&nbsp;

I
stood in the middle of the small, musty-smelling, motel room towel-drying my
hair as I watched Suzanne twist and squirm, lying naked and hog-cuffed on the
bed. I�d give anything to have a picture of this, I thought.� Her wrists handcuffed behind her, her ankles
cuffed together, pulled back and pad-locked to her wrist cuffs.� The same padlock was also used to lock both
sets of cuffs to a small steel ring, which is anchored to a thick,
four-inch-wide black leather belt that encircled her small waist. The belt is
buckled in the front, absolutely no way for her to reach around and release it.
Being locked to the ring limited the movement of both her hands and feet. The
black leather hood enveloping her head was tight and secure.� The leather is soft enough that it conformed
to her head and face perfectly.� It
zipped closed in the back and locked at the base of her neck with a small
padlock.� Her dark hair could be seen
curling up around the thickened neckline of the
leather hood.� A short, thick penis gag,
which was held firmly in place by two hood-mounted straps, was probably too
large for her mouth but she seemed to tolerate it ok.� There were no openings in the hood except for
a small triangular hole, which allowed her small, straight nose to breath air.� Her head
was securely encased in a dark, leather prison.

&nbsp;

I
walked over to the bed and gently pushed my hand between her closed, bent
knees. I could hear her quick, shallow breaths between the inaudible sounds
coming from the hood as she tightened against the steel restraints.�� I waited, holding my hand in place.�� After a moment she slowly opened the area
between her thighs, spreading her knees as far as her cuffed ankles
permitted.� I caressed her inner thighs
while directing my hand toward her crotch.��
When I was within inches of her womanhood I could feel her thigh muscles
vibrating.� The vibrating dildo that I
placed in her vagina before I showered was still at a slow, but strong and
steady hum.� As my hand reached the strap
that secured a hard, rubber butt plug and the vibrator deep inside her I knew
they both were serving their purpose.�
The leather strap was soaked with her juices and the sheet beneath her
was evidence of several orgasms. I tugged on the one-inch wide leather strap
that was pulled tight between her legs and she responded with a quick jerk and
loud moan.

The
crotch strap was fastened in back to the waist strap, pulled tight, between her
butt-cheeks, down, under to separate the outer lips of her vagina, then
proceeded up and buckled to the front of the waist strap.� The crotch strap has four snaps on the
inside, a choice of two in the rear, and two in the front, which assures that a
snap is perfectly located for each hole.��
When used, the rear snap will firmly attach to the six-inch, butt plug,
concealing and securing the anal device in place. The plug has an oblong shape
to its base, which seats itself perfectly between her ass cheeks, and also
prevents it from being swallowed by her anus if the snap came loose. The other
two snaps are positioned a few inches away, allowing either to be used to
attach the vibrator to it.� This
particular vibrator is penis-shaped, seven-inches long, an inch and a half
across and has one-half inch, round, finger-like projections set around and
along it length.� Two �D� batteries are
sealed inside it, and an adjustment for two speeds at its base. Tonight, I
chose the slower, stronger vibrations.

&nbsp;

I
knew the vibrator was uncomfortable for her.�
Suzanne isn�t built for a large cock.�
I stood over her remembering our past and how difficult it was for her
to take all of me inside her. I always loved how responsive she was to my
touch. And tonight I learned that that hasn�t changed over the past few years.

&nbsp;

I
walked over and seated myself at the table, pulled the curtain slightly to one
side and could see a caf� across the street.�
I noticed that the street wasn�t very busy for a Friday night.� A cappuccino sounds good, I thought, as I
closed the curtain.

&nbsp;

�Mmmmpppmmrr�.� �You say something hon�,
I asked. Her moans were becoming a little louder.� I had purposely rented an end room, just in
case.� I reached into a small overnight
bag I brought and removed a comb, cigarettes and lighter.� After combing my still-damp hair I lit a
cigarette, sat back in the chair and savored the scene before me.

&nbsp;

Suzanne�s
skin was glistening with perspiration as I watched her hands struggle in vane
to reach the strap that held her vagina and anus captive.� She is 100 percent woman, I thought.� And her helplessness and vulnerability only
enhances everything she already is, instilling within me an animal-like desire
for her.� I found myself wanting her
again, even more than I did just minutes ago.�
As I sat watching her, I wondered . . . Who�s really the captive
here?� 

&nbsp;

Somehow
the past few years have humbled her, I thought.�
She�s would�ve never come to me before, much less allow herself to be
put in this position.� And she doesn�t
easily admit to being wrong about anything.�
But she did come to me, and at the place of my choosing.� Though she didn�t say it, in an almost an
apologetic manner. Or is she just tired?�
I didn�t see the �determined�, �always in control� Suzanne I once
knew.�� Is it loneliness? Her two girls are
off to college now.� Maybe it�s the
madness in the world today, causing her to reevaluate her priorities.� Or perhaps it�s
guilt over a hasty divorce two years ago, ended our 12-month marriage.� Our marriage was very difficult, for both of
us and her solution to the problems was a divorce.� No ifs, ands or buts about it.� But she�s remarried now.� Is it that bad of a bad marriage I wondered,
as I considered the reasons why she so willingly set herself up to be used in
any way it pleased me. 

&nbsp;

Was
she prepared for it to go this far?�
Maybe she wanted this all along and I never realized it.� I often joked that she needed a good spanking
and her reply was always, �That�ll be the day�.�
Did she really expect to come here and just talk? Whatever her reason for
coming here tonight, its almost irrelevant now, as she�s in no position to deny
me anything I want, nor can she stop me from taking her as many times as I wish
and in any way I please.

&nbsp;

I
met and started dating Suzanne five years ago when I went to work for a company
where she is employed as a bookkeeper.��
She was a 33 year-old divorced mother of two teenage girls.� I was 37, never married and I had no
children.� I was attracted to her the
first time we met.� She�s intelligent, a
bit stubborn, opinionated, independent, controlling, and was used to having her
way.� 

She�s
a hard worker but takes everything too serious.�
But these are the things that attracted me to her, I thought to
myself.� She isn�t glamorous, but she is
attractive. The typical ideal of the girl-next-door.� She�s five foot four inches tall and it looks
like she�s maintaining her idea weight of one hundred fifteen pounds.� I suppose she still does her aerobics three
times a week.� Her dark hair just touches
her shoulders and she keeps it feathered back.�
She has sparkling green eyes, which is accented by thin eyebrows and
high cheekbones.� She�s always been
fanatical about personal hygiene and her appearance, I thought, remembering her
daily, two-hour morning bathroom ritual.�


&nbsp;

Why
did she call
me, I wondered.� I�ve talked to her twice
since the divorce.� About a year ago I
stopped in her workplace to get some papers I needed.� She wasn�t unfriendly, just . . .
indifferent.� I noticed the nameplate on
her desk, still using my name and, she wasn�t wearing any rings.� Maybe I should ask her out to lunch, I
thought.

But,
as our conversation went on I decided against it.� And again about three months ago when I
called her to get a contact number of an associate I worked with while I was
there.� The company doesn�t give that
information out, but I thought she would.�
While talking to her I asked her to lunch. 

�Well,
You know I�m married now.�� She said.

�No,
I didn�t know that.� I replied.

�I
am, she said. �But it�s ok, we can still go to lunch�.� She went on to say she got married several
months ago and they were very, very happy.

�Ooook�, I said.� �I
didn�t know.� We�ll just forget that
idea�.� But she insisted we do lunch
anyway, that it would be ok.� I decided
against it. I really didn�t want to hear about how happy they were and how much
better off she is now. 

�Well,
call me if you ever want to talk�, she said. 

�Ok�,
I said and hung up the phone.

&nbsp;

Until
last week, this has been my only communication with Suzanne.� Last week when she called, I recognized the
incoming number displayed of my cell phone.�
It was the private line to her office.�
I had mixed feelings about talking to her, so I let it ring. If it�s
important she�ll leave a message, I decided.�
And she did leave a message:� �Hi
Russ, it�s Suzanne.�
Sorry I missed you.� I was hoping
maybe we could get together, maybe have coffee and talk awhile.� I�ll call back tomorrow afternoon.� Bye-bye�. 

I
spent the rest of the day thinking about her message.� What could she want to talk about?�� Is she single again?� I wondered. The thought of how easily she
walked out of a marriage, and my life and how easily she thinks she can walk
back into it almost angered me.� Actually,
I don�t believe I�ve really gotten over the anger I felt toward her for walking
out.� Yes, she is single again, I
concluded.� And I would like to see her
again, but it will be on my terms.� 

&nbsp;

I�ve
been involved with only one woman since Suzanne.� I met Shannon about six
months after the divorce.� I moved back
to my hometown and Shannon was a cute, perky 24 year-old cashier
at the corner convenience store.� After a
few weeks of seeing and talking to her on my morning coffee stop the subject of
dating came up.� She talked about the
immaturity of boys her age and expressed her interest in older men.� Understanding this to be an invitation to ask
her out, and meeting the main requirement, I suggested that we go out
sometime.� She agreed, and it was the start
of an eight month relationship.� Shannon made it clear
on our first date what she wanted.� We
had spent our first date at a Renaissance Faire.�� On our way home the conversation was mainly
about the events of the day and life in the fourteenth century. 

There
was a lull in the conversation and after a few minutes of silence, she asked,
�Have you ever spanked a little girl before�?�
I couldn�t believe what I just heard.�
And I wasn�t sure how to take her question.� 

Shannon was little, but she was no girl.� She was a woman and wore the cloths to prove
it.� She looked at me waiting for an
answer.�� �No.� I answered. �But I�ve
threatened to several times.� 

�Would
you like to spank me?� She asked.

�Why,
have you been bad�? 

�Yes.�
she whispered.

Shannon was a submissive searching for a
Dom.� And it was with her that I
discovered and explored the world of bondage and discipline. 

&nbsp;

I
received Suzanne�s call the next afternoon as she promised. 

�Hi
Russ, did you get my message�, she asked. 

�Hello
Suzanne, yeah I did�.

�And�?

�Is
there something wrong�? I asked.

�No,
I was just hoping we could talk a while.�

�But
not over the phone�?

�No�.
She said.

�Won�t
your husband care�?� I asked, thinking my
question would confirm my idea she was again single.

But
she went on to say that he and some friends are going out of town on a fishing
tournament Wednesday and would be gone until Sunday night.� But it wouldn�t matter anyway, he would be ok
with it, she said.

Ok,
so she�s still married, I thought.�
However, I didn�t believe all was well with them.� I told her I�d like to see her, but I didn�t
know my schedule next week.� I�ll call
you Monday, I said.� We talked a few more
minutes, how�s the girls, job going ok, that kind of stuff but hung up with the
understanding I would call her Monday afternoon.

I
knew exactly what my schedule was for that next week but wanted a few days to
think about this �meeting�.

&nbsp;

She
still looks better than most women do at half her age, I thought, as I watched
her struggle onto her side, her breasts falling slightly toward the bed.� Her 34C-28-35 measurements would be the envy
of any women her age, and younger.� I
noticed the large wet area on the white sheet when she rolled to her side.� Yes, I thought to myself, she�s enjoying it
whether she wants to or not. 

�Hmmmphhh�, Suzanne moaned again.

&nbsp;

I
should talk with her, I told myself.�
After all, that is why she
came here tonight.� She didn�t really
resist my advances, though.� She even
allowed me to handcuff her.� But, after
that she had little choice of how the evening would proceed. 

&nbsp;

I
stood up, walked back over to my leather bag and removed a short chain that had
small metal clamps connected at each end.�
I turned to Suzanne and placed one hand on her upper arm, bracing her on
her side.�� �Mmmphhhheeemmmm�,
she moaned in anticipation of something to come.� I laid the chain on the bed and cupped one of
her breasts.� With a milking motion and a
firm squeeze I worked my hand to the small firm nipple.� �Mmmmrrphhh�, she
moaned again as she stiffened her back..� As I slowly rolled her nipple between
forefinger and thumb, it hardened.� I
gave it a firm pinch and then picked up the clamp and fastened it onto the
awaiting nipple. �Arrrmmmmfff�, her body stiffened
again in protest of the clamp.

&nbsp;

With
my forefinger I gently caressed the other nipple in a circular motion.� It was already erect and waiting to be
clamped.� I picked up the other clamp and
caressed her nipple with the cold metal.�
After a few moments, it too was flattened by the clamp. 

�Mmmmpphhhhaarrrr�, was her reply as her body stiffened and
twisted again and again.� But the steel
cuffs held her secure in her hog-tied position.

I
had forgotten just how sensitive her breast and nipples were.� She was one of the few women I ever knew whom
could orgasm just from having her breasts fondled.�� 

I
released her arm and watched as she rolled onto her stomach and back to her
side in an attempt to loosen the clamps, but they held firmly.

&nbsp;

I
walked over to where my clothes were hanging and heard her moan several times
while I got dressed.� Her muffled and
distorted sounds seemed to be more of a plea than protest.� Perhaps she heard me dressing and feared I�d
leave her like that.� But I had decided
to go for that cappuccino; the night�s still young.� I�d only be gone a few minutes, but she
wouldn�t know that.� After dressing I
walked over to her, bent over to speak into her ear and said, �Suzanne, I�m
going for ice�. �Yyyyhhyyoo�! She tried so hard to
make it a clear �no��. �I�ll be back soon.�
Don�t make too much noise now, I�m leaving the door unlocked and you
never know who might come in to investigate that noise�.� �Yyyyhhyyooh�! She
again muttered her disapproval.� �Yes,
yes, I�ll be sure to bring back enough to last awhile�, I said.� �Oyyynhhaat�! She
tried again to express her disapproval as she jerked her body back and forth on
the bed. 

That
should keep her mind swirling for awhile, I thought, remembering our past
games. Suzanne can�t stand it when her nipples are teased with ice cubes; it
drives her into an uncontrollable frenzy.�
I walked over to the table, picked up my cigarettes and lighter and
walked to the door.�� �NYYYHHHYYYAA�! She
sounded almost panicked as I opened the door.�
�Shuush, I�ll just be a short while�, I said
as I closed the door behind me.

Suzanne�s
Return

Part II

By: R.J. Silverwood

(rj_silverwood@hotmail.com)

&nbsp;

I recognized Suzanne�s red
Grand Prix parked in the lot, but I never would have believed that I�d see
several strings of beads hanging on the inside rear view mirror of it.� Although it�s common to see these in every
other car today, for Suzanne to associate herself with what they represent is
downright amazing.� I looked closer at
the beads as I walked by her car and I was able to see the name �Suzi� hanging
from a particular colorful string of exotic beads.� Suzi. I said to
myself.� She always hated that name.� I grinned as I wondered if she actually
�earned� them.

&nbsp;

I kept my attention on the
motel as I waited in the caf� for two coffees to go.� The lot wasn�t brightly lit but I still had a
clear view of the door to our room.� As I
waited I imagined the scene behind that door, and what must be going through
Suzanne�s mind being left alone in her helplessness.� I noticed the clock on a bank sign as I
started back across the highway. It flashed from 10:15pm to 65�.

&nbsp;

I said nothing as I entered
the room.� Suzanne lay on the bed quiet
and motionless.� After sitting the
coffees on the table I walked over and ran my hand along the back of her thigh
and up to the soft fleshy cheek of her ass, then lightly pinched it.� Although she flinched she remained
quiet.� I walked over, gathered her purse
and clothing and took them to my car where I locked the items in the trunk.� Then quickly returned to the room, walked
over and sat on the bed next to Suzanne and unlocked her leather hood.� After a minute the hood was loose and the gag
removed from her mouth.� She squinted,
coughed, bit down and then took in a deep breath. 

&nbsp;

�In almost a whisper she pleaded, �Please,
please. Take it out.�

�Take what out Suzanne?� I
asked, as I rolled her onto her side.� I
knew what she wanted but I wanted her to be specific.� I wanted to hear her say it.� Although she�s not prudish really, I�ve never
heard her refer to a pussy by anything other than a �twink�,
or a cock by anything but a �weenie�.

&nbsp;

�Down there�, she said as
she drew another deep breath. �That thing.�

&nbsp;

�What
thing down where?�� I asked.�
�You must be more specific Suzanne.�

&nbsp;

She took several quick
breaths and squinted at me with her watery green eyes.� She seemed to be trying to bring me into
focus when I said,

�Oh.� I know what you mean�, then reached over and
quickly removed one of the nipple clamps without any warning.

&nbsp;

�AAAAHHMMM!!!� Her yell was nearly as severe as her body reflex, as
she tightened against the steel.� Without
thinking I immediately tried to cover her mouth. After several quick breaths
she begin to relaxed a bit.

&nbsp;

�If I knew you was going to make so much noise I would�ve left it on,� I
said as I gently ran my finger around the freed nipple.

�I�m going to remove the
other clamp Suzanne.� Do I need to
replace that gag before I do it?�� I
asked.

She squinted
her eyes tight and shook her head, preparing herself for the inevitable pain
she knew was coming.

&nbsp;

�MMMMHHHHH�.� She managed
to keep her cry at a lower level but her body still recoiled against the
restraints in reaction to the pain of removing the clamp. 

After a few moments of her
laying on her side and catching her breath, she pulled herself the rest of the
way onto her back, kept her eyes closed, and begin straining her hips and torso
against the cuffs, relaxed then tightened her muscles again.� 

I leaned over and began
kissing the area of her tightened stomach above the waist belt, moving my mouth
up her body with each additional kiss. By the time my mouth reached a nipple
her body was in an uncontrollable cycle of muscle spasms.� I knew how sensitive Suzanne�s breasts were,
and I could tell by her breathing, her movements and her stifled moan that her
orgasm was only moments away.� While I
teased one of her nipples with my mouth, I cupped her other breast with my hand
and gently rolled the nipple between my thumb and forefinger.�� Suddenly she gasped, her body flexed and
while stiffened against the metal holding her ankles and wrists at her back she
begin to trembled.�
My other arm encircled her back as she forced herself up, offering what
she could of herself to me.

After what seemed like
several minutes of holding this position she collapsed.� Catching her breath and between her labored
breathing she pleaded again. �Please� please take it out!�

I raised
up and moved my hand to the strap that was held tight between her legs.�� The leather was soaked with her juices and
although it wasn�t as strong, I could still feel the dying hum of the
vibrator.� 

&nbsp;

�I can�t do it again!�� She pleaded.

&nbsp;

�Take what out Suzanne?� I
whispered.

&nbsp;

�That
THING!�� She answered sternly as she gave me the
hardest look she could manage.

&nbsp;

�That �thing� is a dildo
Suzanne.� A vibrating dildo,� I said. 

&nbsp;

�I know what it is.� Please take it out.�

&nbsp;

�Take it out of what?� I
asked with determined grin.� She knew
what I wanted her to say.� We�ve played
this game before.

&nbsp;

�Down there.�� She answered.

&nbsp;

�Down where?�

&nbsp;

There was a moment of
silence as she rolled her head to one side then back again.� After nearly three hours of this, it
surprised me she had this much fight left in her.

�Pussy!� She quickly whispered.

&nbsp;

�What�s that?� I couldn�t hear you.�

&nbsp;

�Pussy!� Pussy�pussy�pussy.��
She said louder.

�Please take that dildo out
of my pussy.�� She said clearly.

&nbsp;

�That wasn�t so hard now,
was it?� Of course I will.�

&nbsp;

Suzanne was still on her
back so it was easy to release the crotch strap that buckled to the front of
the leather waist belt.� She held her
knees apart as I pulled the dildo from her wet, reddened, swollen pussy.� I could smell her sex as I rolled her on the
wet sheet to her stomach.� I unlocked her
wrists and remove the belt and butt plug.�
However, I decided to leave her ankles cuffed together.

&nbsp;

It took a minute but she
finally sat up without saying a word.� Then moved to the edge of the bed as I moved the coffee closer to
her.� I thought twice about it,
but then decided it�s had a chance to cool down a bit if she decided to throw
it on me.� She took the coffee, �Thank
you,� she said, and then raised her ankles to me.

&nbsp;

�Not yet,� I told her, as I
sat down in the chair with my own coffee.

&nbsp;

As I looked at Suzanne I
realized that I�ve never really seen her like this before.� Her damp matted hair and face still glistened
with dried cum form her earlier effort to pleasure me orally.� I had encased her head within the hood right
after she spend twenty minutes showing me how much she missed me.� Her eyes were red and watery, her makeup was
smeared, and she looked tired.� Wetness
glistened on her pubic hair, and the marks on her wrist were easily noticeable.
But most of all she was quiet and� subdued.��
Maybe it�s the ankle cuffs I thought.�
I�m glad I decided to leave them on her.�
And the chrome does enhance the pink polish of her pedicured
feet.

&nbsp;

She took a sip of her coffee
and asked, �What are you going to do to me now?�
Then added, �You can remove these ankle things, I don�t think I can
stand, much less walk.�

It was then that I noticed
Suzanne�s legs slightly quivering.

&nbsp;

�Well, just try and relax
for now, enjoy your coffee.� I suggested.

&nbsp;

Suzanne and I spend the next
hour or so talking.� She protested
several times when I wouldn�t allow her to clean herself up.� And she was especially concerned about her
clothes and purse. �I assured her they
were fine, I put them up for now is all I would tell her. 

&nbsp;

After a while she did
confess to a hasty marriage, but she�s determined to stick it out because, as
she put it, she�s not going through a third divorce.� After talking with Suzanne a while longer, I
concluded that she really didn�t care if they divorced but she wouldn�t be the
one to initiate it.

I decided this wasn�t such a
bad deal for me. Having an affair with my ex-wife, a woman I still find very
attractive.� And I was still free to do
as I please. I was lost in thought when I saw Suzanne rise and begin hobbling
across the room.�� She nearly lost her
balance as her cuffed ankles permitted her to take only baby steps.

I enjoyed watching her naked
body struggle to stay upright as she tried to walk to the bathroom.

&nbsp;

�Where ya going hon?� I asked.

&nbsp;

She stopped and slowly
turned to me and said, �I need to go to the bathroom.�

&nbsp;

�You�ve got three minutes,�
I said.

&nbsp;

�Huh?�

&nbsp;

�Three minutes.� I said
again. Then added, �Don�t wash up, and don�t close the door.� We�re going shopping.�

&nbsp;

Suzanne stood there in
disbelief.

&nbsp;

�Maybe you are, but I�m
staying here.� I�m going to shower,� She
said firmly.

&nbsp;

�If you
want to argue fine, if you need to pee fine.� Whichever, makes no difference to me.� But in two in a half
minutes I�m putting you in the car and �WE� are going shopping.�

&nbsp;

�You wouldn�t dare
Russ!?�� A look of panic came over her as
she stared at me.

�NO! You can�t be serious!�

&nbsp;

�Two minutes Suzi.�� I said calmly.

&nbsp;

Suddenly, as though something
clicked within her, she knew I was serious.�
And she hurried to the bathroom as fast as her baby steps would move
her.� I met her at the doorway and said,
�Not allowed to close the door.�

&nbsp;

�Ruuussss!?�

&nbsp;

�If you have to tinkle,
now�s the time.�� I said, as I looked at
my watch.

&nbsp;

�I can�t believe this.� She
said as she sat on the commode.

�Why would you humiliate me
like that?� You hate me don�t you?� In here is one thing, but the public?� What if someone sees me? What if we get
stopped?� What if we break down? What
if��

I interrupted her in mid
sentence.� Her thoughts and brain were
moving at lightening speed.

�It�s dark, not many people
are out, my windows are tinted, it�ll be ok.� I said.

Suzanne continued to protest
the whole time I stood there looking at my watch.

The color completely drained
away from her face when I said �Time�s up Suzi!�� 

I handed her some toilet
paper and told her to dry her pussy or she�d leave wet.

She sat there staring at me
and didn�t answer.

�Ok then.�� I said, as I bent down and started to lift
her onto my shoulder.� She immediately
grabbed onto the hand railing along the wall. 

&nbsp;

�If I need to I�d get your
little leather outfit ready.� I whispered into her ear.

She finally let go and other
than her repeating �Please Russ, don�t make me do this.� There was no further
resistance from her.

&nbsp;

Suzanne was folded over my
shoulder when I opened the door to the parking lot.� I used my key remote to unlock the car, which
was parked immediately in front of the room.��
When I was satisfied that no one was around, I rushed to the rear car
door and laid Suzanne in the back seat, closed the door and returned to the
room. After gathering a few items, I locked the door and headed for my Lincoln.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Suzanne was lying on the
back floorboard when I returned to the car.�
There was really no way to know she was in the car until I opened the
driver�s door and the dome lights lit up the inside of it.� As soon as I got in the car she begins again
telling me that I cannot take her out like this.� Hearing the obvious fear in her voice, I
assured her that if she remained in the back, and especially on the floorboard
she wouldn�t be seen by anyone. 

&nbsp;

�Dammit Russ!�� She snapped. �I don�t like this game!�� She emphasized the word �don�t�.

&nbsp;

�I�ll be fun, Suzi.� You�ll love it, the night is young.�

&nbsp;

�Will you at least take
these damn things off my feet?�� Sounding more serious this time.

&nbsp;

�In a
little while.� I have to stop and get something first.�� I said, as I pulled from the motel�s lot.

&nbsp;

Even though I never saw her,
Suzanne wouldn�t stop reminding me of all the reasons this was a bad idea.�� I was ready to change the subject.

&nbsp;

�Tell me Suzi. How�d you get
those beads I saw in your car?� The old fashion way?� I asked.

&nbsp;

She was silent.

&nbsp;

�Well?�� I said, reminding
her I was waiting for an answer.

&nbsp;

�A party.� There was a
Mardi Gras party we went to and I� kinda had to much to drink.�

&nbsp;

�And?� I asked, wanting her to explain further.

&nbsp;

�And� and I didn�t really
fit in.� So I tried to.�

&nbsp;

�Sounds like fun.�� I said with a grin.

&nbsp;

�They had a contest.� To see which of us could collect the most
beads.� I suppose I was a total
disappointment to my husband. What you saw is all I collected.�

&nbsp;

�At least you got one with
your name on it, that�s pretty special.� 

&nbsp;

�Not really, we all got one
with our name on it.�

&nbsp;

�Who�s
we all?� I asked.

&nbsp;

�All the
girls.� I guess they had it planned that way.�

&nbsp;

�Why do you keep them, and
display them like that?� I asked.

&nbsp;

�I don�t know.� They�re pretty.� She answered after thinking
about my question.

&nbsp;

I saw Suzanne�s head pop up
in my rear-view mirror as I made the turn into the parking lot of the Super
Wal-Mart.

&nbsp;

�Why you stopping here?� she
quickly asked.

&nbsp;

�I�ll just be a minute.� You stay back there and you�ll be fine.�� I said.

&nbsp;

I heard her take a long,
deep exasperating breath.

&nbsp;

The parking lot was more
crowded then I expected for a midnight stop at Wal-Mart, but after all, it is Friday night I thought.� I found a parking spot that seemed to be
isolated enough and still be safe.� 

&nbsp;

�Don�t go anywhere.� I said,
as I quickly exited the car.� I heard the
quick �chirp-chirp� sound when I pressed the button on my keypad to lock the
car doors.

&nbsp;

I headed straight to the
women�s clothing section.� If I remember
correctly, Suzanne is a size seven.� I
was looking for a one-piece dress, like maybe a sundress.� After a few minutes I found one that would
do.� It was lightweight, white with light
green palm tree prints, low cut, with spaghetti straps.� It may be a little longer than I wanted, if
so, I could take care of that.� Then I
proceeded to the shoe department and found a neutral colored, flimsy-looking
pair of flat sandals.� These would go
with the dress and show-off her feet perfectly.�
I found a pair of scissors then headed to the checkout, where I also
purchased a twenty-five-dollar Wal-Mart gift card. 

&nbsp;

I waited for several people
to pass the car before I opened the door.�
When I finally did open it, the interior lights revealed Suzanne
squashing herself in the rear floorboard.��
And I noticed another thing also as I entered the car, it was the
odor.� I hadn�t noticed it until now, but
the few minutes of her being closed up in the car gave the odor a chance to
permeate the inside of the car.� I could
smell a hint of her perfume, mixed with the smell of sweat and sex.� I wondered if the smell would be a reminder
to me long after this night was over.

&nbsp;

�Here
Suzanne, for you.�� I told her as I removed the scissors and gift
card and handed her the plastic bag.

&nbsp;

�You didn�t need to do
this.�� She said, then
reminded me that she had worn clothes to the motel.

&nbsp;

�Yes, I know.� But this isn�t a pantsuit night.� This is more appropriate.�

&nbsp;

�Yeah, I just love
surprises.�� She said sarcastically.

&nbsp;

I heard her going through
the bag, then she stopped and said �Russ, let�s just go back to the room and
enjoy the rest of the night together.�
I�m tired and I really would like to get a shower and just relax.�� Then she paused and said, �You can�t possibly
find me attractive looking like I do.�

&nbsp;

I handed her
the key to her ankle cuffs and said, �Well, at least get dressed
first.� You shouldn�t be out without any
clothes on.�

&nbsp;

I heard the ankle cuffs
click open and hit the floor.� I watched
her in the mirror struggle into the dress and after a few minutes of her
rustling, she spoke up and said, �It�s too small.�� 

&nbsp;

�Nonsense.�� I said.� �You got it on.�� 

&nbsp;

�But it�s too tight.�� She replied.

&nbsp;

�It�s a seven, isn�t that
your size?�

&nbsp;

�No.� An eight would�ve been better.�

&nbsp;

�I want to see you in
it.�� I said, and then got out of the
car.

&nbsp;

I opened the back door and
helped Suzanne out and to her feet.� The
red marks encircling her ankles almost blended in with the thin straps of the
tan sandals.� The dress did seem a little
tight on her, especially at her bust, but it only added to the look I was
after.� It came down to knee level.

&nbsp;

�Stand still. �� I said.� Then I reached in the front seat and got the
scissors.� While she stood there I cut a
tag from her sandals, and eight inches off the dress length.� I could feel goose bumps on her leg as my
hand found it�s way up the back of her thigh.

&nbsp;

�Let�s get you back in the
car before you catch cold.� I suggested.

&nbsp;

I watched Suzanne as she
walked around the car.� The dress looked
great on her, but it was obvious if she stooped over any at all she couldn�t
help but flash anyone within seeing distance.�
When she got in the front seat she tried in vain to pull the dress down
far enough to cover her pussy but it was useless.� The dress was not going to hide it. 

&nbsp;

�Sheesh,
Russ.� I hope you�re enjoying this.� I sure ain�t.�� She said.

&nbsp;

�I have an errand for you
Suzanne.�

&nbsp;

�Hasn�t this gone far
enough? I mean really.� Enough is enough.
�� She said
adamantly. 

&nbsp;

I handed Suzanne the gift
card and said, �I want you to go in and get a few
things for me before we head back.�� 

&nbsp;

�I�ve had enough, no
way.� I�m not going in there.� She
snapped. 

&nbsp;

�We�ll leave as soon as you
get back.� Listen close, here�s what I
want you to buy.�

&nbsp;

Suzanne crossed her arms and
stared straight ahead, remaining silent.

&nbsp;

�Get a roll of soft clothes
line rope.� I think it comes in
fifty-foot sections.� One will do. A roll
of duck tape, two tubes of KY jelly, a box of condoms and some breath mints. That card should cover the cost.� Got it?�

&nbsp;

Suzanne turned beet red when
I finished giving her the order, but she said nothing, just looked at me.

&nbsp;

Finally she spoke up, �I ain�t going in there.�

&nbsp;

�We�re not leaving till you
do.� I said.

&nbsp;

�You�re crazy if you think
I�m going in there looking like this, and even more so
if you think I�m going to stand in line with those things in my hand.�

&nbsp;

�The quicker you get it
done, the quicker we get back to the room Suzanne.�

&nbsp;

�You really have it in for
me don�t you?� That�s what this entire
night�s been about, you getting even with me.

&nbsp;

�Well, I suppose we could
find somewhere else to go.� I said.� �But
there�s no telling where you�ll end up, or who you may run into.� And it may be morning before you get that
shower.�� She looked at me as I reached
under the seat and pulled out a set of handcuffs. Then, my hand returned under
the seat and I retrieved the black leather hood she was well acquainted with. 

&nbsp;

�Ok.� Fine!�� She said abruptly.

&nbsp;

She sat there a minute, took
several deep breaths then said, �I may as well get this over with.�

&nbsp;

I lit a cigarette as I
watched Suzanne pulling down on her dress as she crossed the parking lot then
disappear into the store.� I was
pleasantly surprised to find a small wet spot on the leather seat where she was
sitting only a minute earlier.

&nbsp;

After thirty minutes I was
beginning to worry, and I had just decided to go in and find her when she
appeared at the doorway.� And she wasted
no time coming across the parking lot.� I
watched a man follow her out but he turned and proceeded down the
sidewalk.� She got in the car, took a
deep breath, and then with a hint of excitement she said, �I can�t believe I
just did that!� Then she added, �That guy gave me the creeps though.� He followed me all through the store.�

&nbsp;

�What took you so long?� You were teasing him?� I asked. Then before
she answered, I realized it.

&nbsp;

�You washed up didn�t
you?�� I asked firmly.

&nbsp;

�I had to Russ.� I needed to use the bathroom, and I wanted to
wait for that man to leave, so I stayed in the bathroom a few extra
minutes.� While I was in there I had to at
least wash my face. I could smell it on me.��
She said frantically.

&nbsp;

�I didn�t tell you do
that.� You didn�t have my permission to
wash your face.�

&nbsp;

�Well, I�m sorry.� I didn�t know I had to have your permission.�
She said in a sarcastic tone. �I thought it was necessary.�

&nbsp;

�I�ll have to punish you for
that Suzanne.� You have to learn the
rules.�

&nbsp;

�Punish me?� What the hell else can you do to me?� Here, I got what you wanted.� Even though every friggin� person in the store was staring at me.� I still got what you wanted.�

She handed me the plastic
sack.

&nbsp;

�They probably don�t see
anyone like you in there very often. I bet you really liked the attention,
didn�t you?� 

I could see anger welling up
in her.� And before she could respond I
grabbed her arm and leaned her over to me, held her hands behind her back, and
placed the cuffs onto her wrists.

&nbsp;

�Not a word!�� I told her.

&nbsp;

I repositioned her in her
seat, and then secured her safely in the seat belt.� She fought very little except to try and pull
the dress back down over her hips.� I
found the ankle cuffs and soon her feet were locked in them once again.

&nbsp;

She tightened against the
restraints when I moved my hand along the top of her thigh to the hairline of
her neatly trimmed pussy.� �Open it up�.
I said, as I gently worked my middle finger between the wet folds.

�If I didn�t know better,
I�d say you�re enjoying this Suzi.�� I
said with a smile.

&nbsp;

�I can�t win can I? No
matter what I do or say, you turn it around on me.

&nbsp;

�Another word and the hood is next.�� I said.

&nbsp;

She opened her pussy to me
the best she was able to in her position, allowing my finger to fully explore
her sex. When she begin moving her hips, attempting to
suck in more of my finger I moved it to her mouth and used it like a tube of
lipstick, outlining her mouth with her own pussy juice. 

�Now, you may clean up the
mess you left on my finger.�� I told her
as I held my finger to her mouth.

&nbsp;

Suzanne didn�t speak during
the drive back to the Motel.�
Occasionally a streetlight would light up the interior enough that I
could see Suzanne�s closed legs, thighs and pubic hair. And I did notice her
slightly rolling her hips while she was apparently lost in thought. 

&nbsp;

�I�ve decided that we�re
spending tonight at my house Suzanne.� I said, as I parked the car. �Get comfy, I�ll just be a minute�.�� I left her in the car while I went in and
retrieved any belongings either of us had left in the room, and then placed
them in the trunk of the car.

&nbsp;

�May your slave speak?� She
asked, mocking me. 

&nbsp;

I hid a smile as I
considered her request. 

�Yes.�� I answered, 

&nbsp;

�But I have plans tomorrow,
I really can�t.� And my car, I can�t just
leave it here.�

&nbsp;

�I�ll take care of your
car.� And you�ll just have to call and
cancel your plans in the morning.� Just
tell them the truth, that something came up� and you�re gonna
be tied up all weekend.
