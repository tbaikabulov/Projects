A world New order

&nbsp;

Prologue.

&nbsp;

The year is 2197, one
hundred years after the Eugenics wars. With the rise of radical feminism that
had its roots in the 1960s the focal point was the inauguration of the first
woman president of the United State, Marissa Clarand in 2086. Woman had been
making great headway in the years before her election, and unknown to the wider
world a single conspiracy had been in plan by the feminist leaders to devise a
method of bringing the male population under their control. With the
establishment of genetic science and its expansion in the late 20th
century, they had the tools to bring their plan to action.

It only required the
establishment of an elite female government somewhere. That it happened in the
United States was most fortunate as it gave them a technologically advanced
power base.

&nbsp;

The scientists, many of
them men working in the laboratories of the large conglomerates owned or
controlled by the feminist leaders had developed genetics or �Eugenics� as it
came to be known to a high degree. There a method was developed by which the
entire male population could be infected and controlled to an extreme
degree.� Naturally enough the first to be
subjugated was the population of the U.S., giving the feminist leaders access
to a massive industrial/military resource.

&nbsp;

Within ten years the entire
population of the EC had succumbed, leaving the eastern European and Middle
Eastern states and Asia unaffected. The reason for this only became obvious
after the war. Apparently the genetic base they had been working on was largely
confined to Caucasian men. An unfortunate oversight on the feminist leaders
part. It appeared that was sufficient enough difference for the genetic
modifications not to work.

&nbsp;

The discovery of what had
happened led to outright war, between the Eastern Coalition and the Radicals,
unfortunately against the enslaved male soldiers who had no choice but to
fight. As with most wars over the centuries, scientific endeavors became a
melting pot of ideas, and the discovery of a method of cold fusion, meant that
massive amounts of power could be generated quickly, cleanly and cheaply, when
required. This lead to advances in energy weapons and shields, which enabled
the Coalition forces to isolate the Radicalist forces and eliminate them.
Finally depleted of their means to wage war and trapped behind energy fields
they could not penetrate, the Radicals were forced to surrender. 

&nbsp;

Marrisa Clarand and her
female government members were tried and executed. It was felt that a single
statement had to be made and it was decided that their method of execution
would be by public impalement. Stakes were set up around the Washington
monument and the thirty-eight government members were taken out, stripped naked
and then impaled though the anus on the stakes. Each had been treated with
drugs so that the pain would be dulled enough to prevent them dying from shock.
It was intended they should remain as examples for as long as possible. The
leaders of the Radicals who had remained in the background and not taken up
government positions were slowly rounded up and joined the rotting remains of
their co-conspirators, eventually leading to at least five hundred impaled
women around the Washington Monument. It became necessary to enforce the
enslavement of the entire population of women in the U.S and the E.C to control
any further attempts. Additionally it was an unfortunate event that all the
affected males had to be destroyed as well as they could not be returned to
normal.

&nbsp;

During the roundups and
investigation, it became clear that the radicals had members in the coalition
countries, which had attempted to spread the genetics modifications amongst
their own male populations. The discovery lead to the Riyadh convention in
which it was decided that instead of the enslavement act only applying to the
U.S and E.C, it would be world wide. From that moment on, all females would be
owned, initially by the governments, but later by businesses and individuals.
It was illegal to educate women and they were not allowed to read or write at
all. They filled three main roles, Labor force, and Decoration or Pleasure toys.
In addition there were Breeding farms and birthing pens. Male children were
taken away, reared and educated in a specialist environment. Females were
reared at the farms and at the age of sixteen were placed into one of the main
work areas. 

&nbsp;

There had been a number of
problems, rising from the pre- enslavement act female population and it was
decided at the Prague summit, that all females over the age of twenty five
would be eliminated and that in future females at that age would be disposed
of. The method of disposal caused some concern at first until it was discovered
by means of an accident that they could be fed into fusion generators and that
would reduce them to component molecules and atoms. This was also elected the
formal execution method employed by the coalition members. 

&nbsp;

Companies and individuals
could request any number of females, providing they were able to feed and house
them, to certain standards, they could be put to any use required. On any
female reaching the age of twenty five, they could be returned to the Pens and
exchanged for a replacement. Females that fell pregnant had to be returned to
the Birthing pens, they could be reclaimed by their owners afterwards or a
replacement selected, but in reality, few were reclaimed and after birth
un-reclaimed females were sent to the labor force or breeding farms. It was
considered to be a terrible punishment to be sent to the breeding farms. As
females there were kept in a semi-perpetual state of pregnancy, by artificial
insemination, with only a three month break after giving birth, before they
were impregnated again. It can be imagined the turnover was quite high as most
them did not reach the maximum age before being disposed of. Females who fell
ill, would be disposed of as it was cheaper than committing medical resources
to healing them.

&nbsp;

All females were at the
disposal of any male at anytime, but social conventions dictated that if they
were with their owner or any other man, then they would not be available unless
invited or offered. Otherwise they could be commanded to any act a man might
require of them. Those females assigned to the general Labor force would do
anything to become chosen by a company or individual so that they could get a
better life. It was not unusual to see them flaunting themselves having
modified the simple, grey cotton smock they were issued with, to display
themselves as much as possible. But it was unusual such females were chosen as
there were so many others to select, directly from the breeding farms.
Companies choose their females for their attractiveness. Company receptionists
would entertain company clients in whatever way was desired until they were
ready to attend their meeting. It was common to arrive at least a couple of
hours early to any meeting. In the case of a refusal, then the offending female
would be punished by a public flogging or disposed of at the discretion of the
male involved. Thus society developed in a majority of the world, at first only
in the coalition countries, but it soon become popular in others. There were a
few hold outs, but generally in small islands and conclaves around the world
that were considered to insignificant to be a concern.
