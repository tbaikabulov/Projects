Synopsis: A woman is drawn into the world beneath the hollow hills and learns a lesson in redemption, forgiveness, and love from Ahern, Lord of Horses.&quot;The Pure and the Profane&quot;  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Last night, I dreamed of a black horse. Upon
      waking, I looked in the dictionary of dreams I keep in my bedside table,
      to see if there is any significance to this particular nighttime vision.
      It seems a dream of a black horse is a dream of passion. Considering all
      that has happened in the past weeks, I am not surprised.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For I awoke that long-ago night to darkness,
      the moon and stars obscured by low-lying clouds. Cold. Mist swirled thick
      and nearly tangible, like the tattered remnants of a cloak. And buried
      within the mists and clouds, the lilt of pipes and chimes echoed merrily,
      enticing, beguiling.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I found myself in the dooryard of my cottage,
      without any memory of how I had gotten there. Morning glories slept beneath
      my fingers as I traced the lintel, swaying toward the music. My unbound
      hair swept near to my knees, and I toyed with the long locks, wavering.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The music shrilled once and hovered on a mournful
      note, dropping in pitch and tone, grieving in the night. Near weeping for
      my coldness of heart. And so I stepped toward it, once. Hesitated. The
      stone path was cold on my bare feet, and my nightdress was thin for the
      chilly night. Again, the mournful note, tugging at me, heart and soul.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Twisting a lock of hair in my fingers, I drifted
      into the mist.   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I do not remember...clearly...how I arrived there.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Memory was a mist to me, and I wandered lost, and cold.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then I was neither.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The water lapped at my heels, warm and silvery blue, and
  I walked up the hill, beneath apple trees that blossomed sweet and full. Golden
  apples hung heavy on their boughs, too tempting to resist. I drew one down,
  finding the sweet fruit almost melted on my tongue, and the juice dripped from
  my fingers. Bite by bite, I finished it, dropped the core in the dust at my
  feet, and licked the juice from my hand.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The hill rose steadily, a path moving leisurely upward,
  until hill and path crested, and a valley swept below. Spring lay thick and
  heady at the path just before me, but to the west, autumn had begun to bare
  the branches of the forest, and they rolled red-gold on half-hidden hills.
  To the east, the green forests of summer, and north, winter-bared trees slept
  beneath their blankets of snow. None more or less beautiful than the others,
  in its way. And in the center, a gleaming palace that looked carved of crystal,
  ivory, and marble.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; None of this seemed remarkable to me at the time. My only
  thought then was that it would be a very long walk to the palace.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And with no further pondering, I set off down the slope,
  steeper than the one I had ascended. In some places, I caught myself from tree
  to tree, for the ground was treacherous with damp earth and dew-soaked grass.
  Toward the end, the hill nearly tipped over, and I half-fell, gasping, against
  a cherry tree at the base, sliding down its bark to catch my breath.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A shrill whinny echoed across the verdant meadow, and
  I looked up. Black as the night sky, his coat dappled with stars, a stallion
  galloped toward me, dancing on silver-shod hooves as&nbsp;he drew near. His
  eyes were dark and wild as he approached, bending his great head to look at
  me. He snorted, as if pleased with his assessment, and dropped down on his
  forelegs, nudging me up. I slid atop, finding his coat almost too soft for
  purchase, and tangled my fists in his mane, feeling as if I had wrapped them
  instead in satin.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The stallion stood easily and started off at a trot, gaining
  speed as the path widened to a road, breaking into a gallop as orchard and
  meadow faded into a vast plain, wheat rolling in sunkissed waves. Other than
  its rippling and the stallion's heavy hoofbeats, there was no sound.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The palace drew near rapidly and the wind whistled in
  my ears, brought tears to my eyes. Close up, the sunlight reflected off the
  walls and dazzled me.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He stopped at the gates, dropped on his forelegs to let
  me dismount. Standing, he paused and nuzzled my forehead, blowing softly. Nudged
  me toward the fine-wrought arch. Shaking his mane, he departed at a gallop.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There, at last, I paused. There was a strangeness in all
  this, and I vaguely remembered the cottage, the music, the endless walk in
  the mist. It seemed I had lain down on the crest of hill there, among the roots
  of a naked winter tree, and slept...did I sleep still? Did I dream?  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I could not think of it. But the stallion had brought
  me here, nudged me toward the gates, and through the gates I would go.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As with the orchard and the plain, the palace was eerily
  silent. I wandered through halls of surpassing beauty, discovering a tapestry
  here, a vase there, sculptures of such brilliance and poignancy that they took
  my breath away. I came at last to the great hall, vaulting upward on fluted
  marble columns, arching toward a crystalline dome that flickered with passing
  cloud and sunlight. There, a dias, with a great chair carved of ivory and inlaid
  with gold and jewels. Beside it, a golden cage, its door ajar, a bench cushioned
  in what looked like red velvet within. Beside the bench, a flute and a pennywhistle.
  What drew my attention, however, were the long tables down the center of the
  room, a feast that set my mouth watering. Fowl and venison, fruit and bread,
  sweetmeats of all kinds, and pitchers of wine and mead that poured crimson,
  white, rose, and gold. With a mental shrug, I sat and ate my fill. The climb
  and the ride had left me with a mighty hunger.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So the day passed in my exploration, and neither sight
  nor sound of any other living creature did I find. Bemused, uncertain, but
  not yet afraid, I found a bedchamber and cast myself upon the softest mattress
  I'd ever known, thinking an instant before I drifted off that I had never fallen
  asleep in a dream before.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I did not know it then, but I can imagine it
      now. The door opens and he enters in a well of silence, pausing on the
      threshold to gaze at his prize. She stretches across the bed as though
      she has no cares, luxuriating like a cat in its softness, her breathing
      deep and even. Moonlight pools and shatters across the bedclothes, and
      her hair spills off the side, a rich brown pelt with highlights of red
      and gold. She does not stir as he approaches, to study her more closely.   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her face is finely boned, fragile and fair.
      Her lashes sweep thick and dark over high cheekbones. Her eyes, when she
      opens them, will be violently blue, shading to purple if she wears the
      right colors. He smiles at the sight of her, and doffs his clothing quickly,
      sliding into bed beside her, as warm and liquid as a bath.   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She sleeps as he wills it, and he unlaces her
      nightdress from the front, sliding it first from her arms, and then drawing
      her to him  . He casts the nightdress away from them
      both, and rises to his knees beside her, sliding his hands up a narrow
      waist, to curve around ripe breasts. The sides, for the moment; he traces
      her from swell to waist to dainty flank, and then bends his head to catch
      a rosebud in his teeth.   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She sleeps, still, but her lips part, and a
      contented sigh escapes them. Lightly, he tongues first one nipple, then
      the other, and stretches his long body above hers, relishing the feel of
      her softness beneath him. Her legs have already begun to part when she
      stirs.   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The warmth tightened low in my belly, and the shadowy
  face above me chuckled, thick and rich. Lips captured my own, smothering my
  protests, and my hands could not find purchase on his chest to push him away.
  They slipped from his flesh, and when I drew them back to strike him, they
  struck nothingness.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Worse, his hands traced me from breast to thigh, in between
  and back again. His mouth devoured me, his breath hot on my breasts as he suckled
  them, plucking at the tips with his fingers. He kissed me, and his tongue pressed
  inward, invading, conquering. I could not fight him, and he soon left my head
  in such a muddle, I could not try.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Until I felt a heat between my legs, a restless inward
  drive, and I gasped and squealed, drawing my hips back.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A fist caught in my hair, yanked my head back, and he
  caught my pulse between his teeth. I felt it as if my own teeth were upon it,
  like a plump crimson fruit that would burst, juicy and ripe, when I bit into
  it. The other hand caught both my wrists and twisted them above my head, that
  one hand encircling them like an iron band.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The heat slipped up, and in.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I gasped again, this time with pleasure. Everything I
  had ever been told was that the first time hurt. But this&ndash;this...  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stars burst behind my eyelids, and the length of him stretched
  me, filled me. Gradually, at first&ndash;I could feel from the distance of
  his hips that he had not fully entered, and I was already lost. His hand slowly
  untangled from my hair, slipping beneath my arm to catch me at my shoulder
  blade, drawing me against him. When I did not resist&ndash;nay, I curled closer&ndash;he
  released my wrists, holding me in his arms as he slipped ever deeper within
  me.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I could not breathe.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He smelled...indescribable. The scent of him was thick
  in my nostrils, dizzying, the scent of clean water and growing grass, the musk
  of deep wintery forests, the crispness of snow. One hand slipped out to catch
  me under my chin, turning my lips up to his, and his tongue entered even as
  he abruptly lunged forward, sending the last few inches of himself into my
  spine, bowing me with a gasp of abrupt pain.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My nails raked him, and I turned my face from his, sinking
  my teeth into a broad shoulder. The stars still burst behind my eyes, but they
  were red stars. He neither slackened nor quickened, and the pain died slowly,
  pleasure pooling in dark crevices.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I could feel his breath on my cheek, and my own was hard
  upon me. How long had I known him? A moment, an hour, a lifetime? I would remember
  the feel of him, under my hands, above me, inside me, until the end of my days.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His chest rose and fell more rapidly, and once the moonlight
  almost lit his face&ndash;long enough for me to see the blue highlights in
  his thick black hair, the depthless darkness of his flashing eyes. Then, no
  time to look, no time to think, only the glorious thunder of flesh against
  flesh, the feel of the cabled muscles of his lower back and thighs, coiling
  and uncoiling like steel wires.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pain and pleasure mingled under the onslaught, and I began
  to gasp softly, to cry out, to whisper encouragement in murmurous undertones.
  He drew my head to his chest, holding it there, as if to brace me for the finish.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whatever strength was in him, he unleashed. He slipped
  a finger in my mouth when I shrieked, and I bit down fiercely, heedless of
  the damage. I wondered, frantically, how deep he could possibly go, how long
  he could possibly be, almost split in two with it. And then I was crying out,
  breathless, blind with pleasure and scarce remembering any other moment of
  my entire life. Dimly, I heard his deeper cries as he finished in glorious
  spurts. Filling me until I was sated, complete, and more whole than I had ever
  felt before. My head drooped.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For long stretches of eternity, there was nothing but
  our breathing, our sweat-slick bodies pressed together, his slowly wilting
  member still thick within me. Dazed, I only half-felt him lay us both down,
  my head pillowed on his chest, the slow thump of his heart beneath my ear.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I awoke to silence. The ache in my body was testament
  to the reality of the night, and I curled around it briefly, relishing the
  pain, the remembered pleasure. The sheets were cold beside me, but I could
  feel the weight of him there, could see the wild flash of his gaze in my mind's
  eye. Could feel the muscled expanse of him above me, and I squeezed my eyes
  shut to hold it to me.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At long last, I rose, and almost doubled up with the pain.
  I could only walk stiffly, and I searched for my nightdress, for any garment.
  There were none.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That was the first time fear prickled along my spine.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At a loss, I remained in my room for most of the morning,
  wrapped in sheets, watching the wheat blow from my window and wondering how
  I had come here, what it meant...what he wanted. There were no answers in the
  silence. And I was ravenous.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Swathed in the golden sheet, I finally ventured forth,
  clutching the satiny material to me. The corridors were a maze as I moved,
  stiff-gaited, in the direction of the Great Hall.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was filled.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Creatures, men and women, seated in long rows at the banquet
  tables, creatures that shone and bent the light, sending it forth doubled.
  I cannot remember their faces now, but I looked at one after another, each
  more beautiful than the last, remembering only belatedly that I wore nothing
  but a sheet, that I was at best a guest here, and realizing that the Hall had
  fallen quiet as I stood before the doors.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then my eyes fell on him.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He sat in the chair on the dias. No, he lounged, one booted
  foot across his knee, the fingers of one hand drumming lightly on the arm.
  He of the dark hair and the darker fierce eyes, clothed in samite and satin,
  cloth-of-gold, and doeskin boots that matched the fine cloth. He nodded to
  me, gestured me forward, and I went, feeling the eyes on me like a weight.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I knelt at the dias; I could not help it.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The ghost of a smile flickered at his lips.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;What do you want with me?&quot;  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Want?&quot; A real smile then, feral, curving.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Why am I here?&quot;  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Sit, little one. Here.&quot; He gestured to the
  cushion beside his chair&ndash;throne, I thought&ndash;and I merely stared
  up at him. One black brow arched, and he sighed. &quot;I'd forgotten how tiresome
  you mortals can be.&quot; He stood, catching my hand and raising me to my feet. &quot;I
  brought you here, little one, because you are beautiful, and your song is lovely.
  I collect beautiful things.&quot;  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was not the answer I had expected.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He captured my other hand, and stretched both out from
  my sides. Uncertain, and bewildered, I let him, knowing that I had wrapped
  the sheet in such a way that it would not easily reveal me. Nonetheless, he
  caught it where it wrapped at my neck, tugged...and it was gone.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I could not see where it had gone, but I was nude, and
  I gasped, covering myself with my hands and my hair.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Now, little one. Sit,&quot; he said, settling back
  in his throne.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I paused, torn. Run past the long tables of staring eyes,
  remain standing with my back to them and my hair covering everything of interest,
  or obey, sit beside him on the cushion, and be mostly covered, but facing the
  room of them.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Obedience was not high on my list of priorities, but that
  option remained the least humiliating. Cheeks crimson, I sat stiffly on the
  cushion, bringing my hair over my shoulders to cover most of me, knees clamped
  together. And thoroughly confused. From the corner of my eye, I saw the empty
  cage, and the significance of the flute and pennywhistle. It chilled me.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Leisurely, his hand stroked my back, my hair, as I would
  have petted a dog back home. Home. Unexpectedly, I found tears in my eyes.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Slowly, conversation resumed around me, and I watched
  furtively from under lower lashes. The banqueters' eyes darted to me occasionally;
  the hint of a smile, and sometimes one would turn to whisper in another's ear,
  both then turning to stare boldly. My cheeks were hot with it, and I nearly
  squirmed. Other than petting, however, my lover ignored me.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Him, too, I watched. He listened, head bent attentively
  when one of them spoke; he smiled, and I was lost in his smile, in his grace.
  He was beautiful; his face chiseled and elegant, arrogantly handsome, his throat
  a strong brown column rising from his open-necked tunic. I remembered kissing
  the line of that throat, and flushed. My hands knotted nervously before my
  knees, and I sat through that interminable feast, embarrassment and arousal
  flickering at me like a candle burning at both ends. As, no doubt, my lover
  intended.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The plates were finally whisked away by unseen hands,
  the toasts called, and a tall woman rose from a nearby table, her lips curving
  with the question.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Will you not have your new pet entertain us, My
  Lord?&quot; Her eyes caught mine and sparked wickedly.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He glanced down at me, as if he had forgotten I was there.
  His hand slipped over my shoulder to caress my face, and he tilted it up with
  one long finger. The touch sent a shiver through me.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Will you sing, little one?&quot;  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My lips would not work to form the words, and I stared
  at him like a simpleton. After a long moment, I managed to shake my head, albeit
  faintly.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One dark brow arched, and his hand dropped from my face. &quot;You
  displease me,&quot; he murmured, and called for a minstrel.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bereft of his touch, of even the heedless stroking, I
  was cold, and color flamed even more brightly into my face. Now, I could meet
  no one's gaze, even furtively. I felt the shame on me like a weight, and I
  glanced at him from the corners of my eyes, but he would not notice.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I remembered last night's pleasure, and felt ungrateful.
  Unworthy. It burned in me, this shame, and the longer the music when on, the
  more oppressively it weighed. At last, I could no longer bear it. Like a child,
  I plucked hesitantly at his sleeve.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I will sing,&quot; I whispered.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another smile; this one of real pleasure.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;In the cage, my songbird,&quot; he replied, and
  I paused, sucking back a swift rejection. There was some magic in him that
  made me unwilling to...displease him. The caress he gave me as I stood was
  worth any humiliation.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I blessed my long hair as I walked to the cage, trying
  desperately not to feel the eyes on me. A song...I would sing, I would play,
  and I would not see the multitudes before me. I would sing and play for him.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His eyes, too, were on me as I seated myself on the bench,
  picking up the flute first. A slow song, then; a song of hearth and home, of
  the green hills and mists of my country. I wept as I played, with longing;
  but I looked at my lover and could not have said for what I longed more.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What was he to me? Who was he? Where was I?  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was lost in more ways than one as I searched for the
  bedchamber, asking questions that were long overdue. Questions that had no
  answers, and the vision of him in my mind, the memory of his scent in my nostrils,
  sent my heart skittering and my thoughts scattering. Worse, though, the two
  words that echoed ceaselessly:  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your pet?   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It almost&ndash;but not quite&ndash;chilled me.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Time passed oddly here, sometimes in great galloping strides,
  sometimes with an almost audible grain-by-grain fall of sand in an hourglass.
  Now, it slowed to a crawl, and though the moonlight through the windows never
  altered its position, I was certain I had been searching hours for that room.
  Almost desperate enough to knock on one of the unfamiliar doors that lined
  this corridor, though by their shape and color&ndash;and the sounds within&ndash;I
  knew they were not my bedchamber.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I nearly ran him down as I turned a corner to yet another
  endless hallway, and he caught me as I stumbled backward.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Lost, little songbird?&quot;  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was almost impossible to speak when I looked him in
  the face, and I felt my head nod, as if it were a separate weight attached
  to the rest of my body. He smiled, stepped back, idly tapping a flogger against
  his boots.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I was searching for you. Come.&quot;  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My gaze followed the motion of the flogger, his words
  failing to register. His hand caught my chin, almost roughly, and he forced
  me to look at him instead of the swaying tails.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;You displeased me, little one. And you have lessons
  to learn.&quot;  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Worse and worse, but my feet were rooted to the floor.
  Lessons? A flogger?  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your pet?   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My fists tangled nervously in my hair, and he caught me
  by the elbow, drawing me down to the end of that long dark corridor. Once,
  he glanced back at me, with a flash of wild dark eyes and a toss of his head.
  It reminded me of something. I had no time to think what.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The room we entered was much like the other bedchamber,
  large and spacious, draped in fine cloths and tapestries. He collected beautiful
  things. I gazed around the room, remembering, very belatedly, that he considered
  me one of those beautiful things.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And I had displeased him.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I had lessons to learn.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He had, in the time I spent gawking, seated himself on
  the bed and was slipping his shirt off. I very suddenly could not stand, and
  sought the nearest chair on shaking knees. Dimly, I thought that there was
  something that had been worrying me, something he had said...but he smiled
  at me, rising in a line of golden-brown flesh and knotted muscle.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Come here,&quot; he said, softly, stretching out
  his hand to me. I went, slipping into his arms as if I were made to fit there.
  He kissed me, lips and tongue and teeth, the muscles working in his neck as
  if he were going to devour me from the mouth down. I was nearly cross-eyed
  when he was done, and resisted not at all as he turned me, pressing me to the
  wall beside his bed.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Something soft and strong closed over my wrists, and by
  the time I realized it was not his hands, it was too late.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;We believe,&quot; he began softly, running his hands
  along my rib cage, &quot;that repentance and forgiveness are as much a part
  of love as the act itself. Is there anything you're sorry for, my love?&quot;  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I hissed out a breath at his nearness, at the feel of
  his hands on my body, and almost forgot that he was expecting an answer.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I...&quot; I licked my lips. &quot;I...displeased
  you.&quot;  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His hands began to catch my hair, drawing all of it up
  into a tail at the back of my head, which he knotted tight and slid over my
  shoulder, so the long mass flowed over my right breast and rippled softly just
  above my knees.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;How did you displease me?&quot;  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I...&quot; Could not possibly think enough
      to form any sort of coherent answer when he was doing...that...to me.   &quot;I
      would not sing when first you asked me.&quot;  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Are you sorry for it?&quot; He nibbled the exposed
  earlobe, his breath tickling my ear. Gooseflesh broke out along my shoulders.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Yes,&quot; I said, turning my face toward him. He
  kissed me again, a gentle brush of lips, and left me. His boots thudded softly
  across the fine woven carpets, more heavily on the marble floors, and the door
  opened and closed softly. He was gone.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And so I stood, bewildered. I tested the bonds at my wrists
  and found that I could not slip from them, and pressed nearly flat to the wall,
  I could not pull strongly enough to try whatever anchored them. The room was
  utterly dark, utterly silent, and I leaned my forehead against the cool stone.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His kiss still burned on my lips, the scent of him still
  thick enough to taste. His breath tickling my earlobe. His hands on my body.
  That lovely, lovely face. I had displeased him.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And I was sorry for it.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I'm sorry,&quot; I whispered, and things low in
  my body tightened. The feel of his back beneath my hands, the ripple of muscle
  as he pressed inward. &quot;I'm sorry.&quot;  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who knows how long I stood there. Time crawled, and daylight
  drew no nearer. My legs were trembling, my breasts cold from contact with the
  stone wall, and my hair was tickling me awfully at neck and breast. Apart and
  beyond these minor irritations, the regret oppressed me, until I wept openly,
  drowning in a sea of penitence. What I would have given for him to come back...for
  his touch, the murmurous, rich tone of his voice, the rise and fall of his
  words, meant for me alone. I had thrown that gift away, I had...  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The door opened and closed once again, the familiar muted
  thud of his tread, and I sagged in my bonds, crying out my sorrow.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A snap cut me short, and five tails of flame smashed into
  my back.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;You are sorry?&quot;  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the moment it took me to catch my breath, the tails
  snapped again. And I found my voice, looking over my shoulder to the looming
  shadow. The tails kissed fire.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I begged. I pleaded. Not for release, not for surcease,
  but for forgiveness. I understood. Repentance, forgiveness. As much a part
  of love as the act of love. The bonds rubbed hotly at my wrists, the stone
  cold on the front of my body, and the flogger slashed in burning lines across
  my back.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There had never been anyone or anything else, and this...this
  was love. This was redemption. This was what I sought my life long, and never
  knew it.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I breathed in shuddering gasps when he paused, and his
  hand moved gently over my welted back.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;You will not bleed,&quot; he said, nipping the place
  where my neck joined my shoulder. His tongue traced up the column, and I nearly
  dropped. &quot;You will be forgiven.&quot;  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I had no words for my gratitude. I closed my eyes, and
  sighed, relaxing. My back ached as if the stallion had trampled it.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Soon,&quot; he added, and the flogger lashed forth
  again.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I hung in my bonds when he was done. Perspiration streamed
  down my forehead, and he cut my babbled apologies short with a kiss. Thrice
  he had left me, and returned. Thrice the lash had writhed over my skin, and
  I was sorry. Oh, I was sorry for it.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Come,&quot; he said gently, freeing me from my bonds,
  and catching me when I fell. &quot;You are forgiven, my love.&quot;  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He carried me across the room, and slipped me onto sheets
  that felt like cream against my abused flesh. There he joined me, shedding
  boots and trousers as he came, his kisses a different rain of fire on my cold
  breasts. But it was not his kisses, or the bed, that made me catch him to me
  with a cry.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was forgiven.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There was an urgency that had not been present the night
  before&ndash;a need for him beyond the need for food or water. And he responded
  to it, pinning me beneath him and entering in one long thrust that drew a scream
  from me, even as I writhed beneath him. I raked him with my nails, I bit. And
  he was rough, he was violent, forcing me down, catching my hands&ndash;even
  striking my face once.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I exploded. And a moment later, so did he.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My face was numb. My back hurt. I breathed in shallow,
  ragged gasps, sprawled on top of him, my head pillowed on his chest. So small
  was I&ndash;or so large he&ndash;that my whole body fit easily on his, and
  I curled in his arms, dazed with the pain and the pleasure of it all.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How I loved him.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I licked the sweat from his chest sleepily, vague memories
  of home surfacing, the shadowy recall of a place where this was a thing never
  to be imagined. Where such as he was only legend, half-forgotten, a story of
  people banished to lands beneath the hollow hills, of phantom pipes in the
  night...pipes that lured mortals into those hollow hills.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; People taken there vanished for a day, a week, or a hundred
  years.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;You were the horse.&quot;  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I sat up.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;The stallion who brought me here&ndash;that was
  you.&quot;  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He smiled, teeth flashing in the moonlight.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;You are a beautiful thing. I collect&ndash;&quot;  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;&ndash;beautiful things,&quot; I finished for him.
  My heart drummed in my chest. &quot;How long will you keep me?&quot;  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His brow furrowed, his wild black eyes gleamed. &quot;Until
  I find you tedious,&quot; he said threateningly.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The threat was not lost on me, and the heat of the flogger
  still blazed across my back. My questions were answered. The silence stretched
  between us.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was my choice. I looked down at him, willing the softness
  from my heart&ndash;for a moment, I promised the resultant ache, only for a
  moment&ndash;thinking of home, those things that I missed, the lessons I had
  learned here. Passion. Repentance. Forgiveness.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Love.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I bent my head slowly, kissed him softly. Penitently.
  And he returned it, forgiving.  
&nbsp;&nbsp; Last night, I dreamed of a black horse. Upon waking,
      I looked in the dictionary of dreams I keep in my bedside table, to see
      if there is any significance to this particular nighttime vision. It seems
      a dream of a black horse is a dream of passion.   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was no dream.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I bear the stripes still.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And how I long for him.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am lost&ndash;in a world that no longer makes sense
  to me, a world where the smell of those golden apples is but a breath away,
  but always a step beyond my reach. I remember stories that would thrill any
  mortal to laughter, to tears, to sorrow and joy, and yet I cannot recall the
  words. My golden cage, where I sang and piped, learned their songs and their
  ballads...but my fingers are clumsy now, and I have put my music away.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My days there bled into nights, numberless shadings of
  dawn and dusk, days spent riding, wandering through his four orchards, fingers
  twined in his, lost in him. And my nights...nights that I learned pleasure
  and pain, learned to crave the kiss of the lash, the touch of the crop, and
  ungentle ministrations that sullied and purified. The dance of the pure and
  the profane, on satin sheets.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And at last, he bore me away, the stallion, the Lord of
  Horses, through the autumn forest, where the smell of berries and coming winter
  was thick. Up a sloping hill and to the silver-blue water. I was a beautiful
  thing still, but no longer his. He had nothing more to teach me.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I remember him, the fire of him&ndash;Ahern, Lord of Horses.
  Collector of beautiful things. Lover. Teacher.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I crave the kiss of the lash, I crave repentance, and
  forgiveness. Love. Love, above all else.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I dream of that black horse, and I dream of things greater
  than passion.
