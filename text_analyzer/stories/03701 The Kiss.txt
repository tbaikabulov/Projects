Synopsis: A doctor plays a prank on a patient that goes too far.THE KISS 
By, BZ 
Danielle had been going to Dr. John Svenson for slightly over a year now.
  She had started seeing him because of a weight problem that had developed after
  the death of her best friend Missy a little over two years ago . Missy had
  been Danielle's twelve-year-old smoky grey Weimaraner. Being married to her
  career, and not having much time for a social life the death of her pet had
  left a void in her life, and she had been filling that void with food. 
She had managed to gain over seventy pounds before finally deciding to do
  something about it. Years earlier when she had decided to quit smoking, her
  family doctor had been able to help her through the use of hypnosis. So, it
  made perfect sense to her that since hypno-therapy had worked for her once
  before; it should work again and provide the solution to her weight problem.
  And since she was now half a continent away from her old family doctor she
  sought out the services of Dr. Svenson. 
Dr. Svenson's program had worked wonders on Danielle's weight loss problem;
  with his help she had been able to stick to the diet and exercise regimen he
  had set up for her. She had tried on several occasions to work out a diet and
  exercise program she could stick to on her own. But, each time she had failed
  and would gain the weight back she had lost plus some. 
Under Dr. Svenson's guidance she had steadily made the transformation from
  a plump butterball with a pretty face to an alluring and svelte twenty-nine
  year old and, although her wardrobe consisted entirely of pant suits, the men
  in her office were starting to take notice as well. 
Dr. Svenson himself, found that he was not immune to Danielle's growing allure,
  her beautiful face had garnered his attention from her very first visit, and
  as the pounds ebbed away he could discern a very attractive female hiding under
  all those business suits she insisted upon wearing. 
He decided to ask her if she would consider seeing him on a non-professional
  basis. To this he had been politely, but definitively rebuffed. Danielle said
  that she would prefer to maintain a purely professional relationship. She enjoyed
  looking and feeling good, but her career would always come first, and she didn't
  want to have to find another doctor. 
Dr. Svenson did not take the rebuff well however, he was unaccustomed to rejection
  from the fairer sex. And so he made up his mind to read his notes on patient
  Danielle Dawson once again. Soon the seed of an idea began to form in his mind. 
By the time Danielle had arrived for her next appointment Dr. Svenson had
  prepared his revenge. He would later admit to himself that it had been a cheap
  parlor trick and very sophomoric on his part, but unfortunately for Danielle
  that did not prevent him from proceeding at that moment. 
He placed his subject in her usual trance; he reinforced the commands that
  had helped keep Danielle on track with her diet. But instead being wakened
  as usual, he deepened her trance instead. 
�Danielle when I snap my fingers you will open your eyes, but you will not
  awaken.� 
Dr. Svenson snapped his fingers and Danielle's eyes popped open. Danielle
  did not move, she continued to lay on the couch her eyes open but staring off
  into space. He removed a Zippo lighter from his pocket; he spun the flint wheel
  igniting a frame. He held the lighter in front of Danielle's eyes then proceeded. 
�Danielle do you see the flame?� 
�Yes doctor.� 
�Good, now watch the flame as it flickers. As the flame dances before your
  eyes you will be drawn deeper and deeper into it. You will not be able to look
  away from the flame you will look deeper and deeper into the flame, and as
  you peer deeper and deeper into the flame it will consume you as you fall deeper
  and deeper asleep.� 
He continued the monotone until he thought that he had achieved the proper
  depth to the trance, but he needed to test the depth of her trance. �Danielle
  hold up your hand,� he then took a hypodermic needle and plunged it straight
  through the palm of her hand, she did not flinch or make a sound. To himself
  he thought, �You are one excellent subject Danielle.� 
�Now close your eyes and sleep, you are now in a very deep trance, while you
  sleep you will feel like you are floating and you will be aware of only one
  thing, the sound of my voice. Now drift and sleep, sleep, sleep.� 
�You are doing very well, now I will snap my fingers twice and you will open
  your eyes, you will be able to move and talk as if you were awake but you will
  still be asleep. Then I will ask you a few questions, very simple questions
  but when you try to answer you will be unable to speak, instead you will bark
  like a dog.� 
Dr. Svenson went to his desk and removed his digital camera. Then, so that
  he would not have to use a flash, (the sudden flashes might inadvertently wake
  his subject) he opened the drapes and blinds flooding the darkened room with
  natural light. When he was sure that everything was ready he snapped his fingers
  twice. 
Danielle's eyes flickered open and she started rise from the couch thinking
  the session was over. 
�Before you leave Danielle, I need to ask you a few questions. How much weight
  do you think you have lost so far?� 
Danielle thought for a moment then said: �Arf, Arf, Arf.� She looked puzzled
  then tried to respond again. �Arf, Arf, Arf, Arf.� 
�Really Danielle try to take this seriously, lets try a different question.
  What High School did you attend?� 
Danielle did not need to think about this, she quickly blurted out. �Arf,
  Arf, Arf, Arf.� 
She covered her mouth hoping to keep the barking contained. 
�Well my girl if you insist upon speaking like a dog, then you probably should
  get down on all fours and act like a dog as well.� 
Danielle dropped down to her hands and knees, and with a baffled look upon
  her face still tried to talk. �Arf, Arf, Arf.� 
�Good doggy, now come here.� 
Danielle crawled across the floor to the doctor's desk. Dr. Svenson clicked
  away photographing each step. 
�Good doggy, now sit pretty if you want a treat.� 
Danielle sat back on her heels, pulled her arms in with her wrists limp and
  her tongue hanging out. She actually resembled a dog begging its' master for
  a scrap of food. Dr. Svenson patted Danielle on the head and gave her a small
  piece of biscuit then said, �good doggy.� 
Then placing a collar around Danielle's neck, he attached a leash and said, �Come
  doggie let go for walksies.� 
For an entire hour Dr. Svenson walked Danielle around on a leash, he had her
  sitting and begging for treats, and he even had her doing rollovers. All the
  while he snapped picture after picture with his camera. 
Finally he returned her to couch and gave her the command to sleep. Danielle
  returned to her deep trance state. 
�That had been fun,� he thought to himself. But then getting serious again
  he intoned. �Danielle now you will return to a natural trance. I still have
  a question or two for you and you will answer normally. When your dog Missy
  died did you keep anything of hers?� 
�Yes doctor, I kept her collar.� 
�Excellent Danielle, I want you to bring that collar with you on your next
  visit.� 
�Yes doctor.� 
�You are an excellent subject, now sleep. In a moment I will snap my fingers
  and say, �Wake.� You will awaken feeling better than after a good nights' sleep.
  You will feel relaxed and rejuvenated. You will remember only your dietary
  instructions but absolutely nothing else. Is that clear Danielle?� 
�Yes Doctor.� 
Dr. Svenson put away his camera, closed the blinds and drew the curtains shut.
  Then he went to the couch snapped his fingers and said. �Wake.� 
Danielle's eyes fluttered opened, she yawned and stretched then rose from
  the couch. �You know Dr. Svenson I feel so good it's almost criminal.� 
Dr. Svenson had been a little surprised at her choice of words but smiled
  professionally and said; �You have reached the hardest part of your program,
  you are almost at your goal, and those last few pounds can be the hardest.
  Then again maintaining your weight can be even harder. So I'm going to have
  you come once a week for a while, I'll see you next Thursday. Okay Danielle?� 
�Okay, next Thursday.� 
The following Thursday after Dr. Svenson had spent the week fantasizing over
  his pictures of Danielle. The reality of how reckless he had been finally sank
  in. Danielle, after all, was not just a patient she was a lawyer; if she discovered
  what he had done she could and would ruin him. His original thought had been
  to show her the pictures and coerce her into an affair. Her parting remark,
  though, had made him unsure. He wondered how the courts would view this sophomoric
  prank of his. He wondered could she have some idea of what he had done or had
  the criminal reference been a mere coincidence? 
Danielle, in fact had thoughts of just two things, the case she was working
  on and the success she was having with her diet. She had no clue about anything
  else. 
In fact, she had been finishing up at work and preparing to leave for her
  appointment with the good doc. Then as she went through her handbag looking
  for her car keys she found something odd. She pulled the collar from her bag
  and wondered to herself. �Now how did Missy's old collar find it's way into
  my purse.� She dismissed it thinking to herself. �Oh well, I'll figure it later,
  right now I'm late.� She jammed the collar back in her purse and hurried off
  to her appointment with Dr. Svenson, she really hated to be late. 
She arrived at the doctor's office with minutes to spare as usual. And her
  session went as usual, but when the time came to wake her and send her own
  her way Dr. Svenson faced a dilemma, what to do, what to do. He was confident
  that she had been in a deep trance, but still the seed of doubt had been planted.
  His curiosity had been peeked and he wanted to see if she had actually brought
  the collar as directed. But, could she be setting him up? 
Finally, curiosity had won out, he decided to take the risk. And instead of
  waking her as should have, he again ordered her to open her eyes and had her
  stare into the flame provided by his trusty Zippo. She would be in a deep trance
  within seconds. 
He decided to test her again. But this time he plunged a hypodermic needle
  very slowly through the center of her open palm. He watched her face closely
  as the needle journeyed through her hand, but once again she showed no reaction
  as the needle projected through to the other side of her hand. 
He removed the needle from her hand then asked, �Danielle, did you bring Missy's
  collar with you?� 
�Yes Doctor.� 
�Where is it Danielle?� 
�In my purse.� 
Retrieving her purse he opened it quickly, and found the collar jammed down
  inside. 
Dr. Svenson's confidence had been fully restored. 
He fondled the collar for a moment, it was a wide red leather Victorian style
  collar with faux gems garnishing it and a tag that read Missy on one side and
  had Danielle's address and phone number on the other. 
�My God, she is the perfect subject.� He thought again. 
�Danielle stand up,� she rose from the couch, �when I snap my fingers you
  will open your eyes, but you will remain asleep.� 
He snapped his fingers; her eyes popped open and she stood staring vacantly
  ahead. 
�Now Danielle do you see what I am holding?� 
�Yes Doctor.� 
�What is it?� 
�It is Missy's collar.� 
�That's right very good Danielle. From now on Danielle, when you see Missy's
  collar in my hand like this you will return to the same trance state you are
  in now, you will be in a deep deep trance and you will only be aware of my
  voice, do you understand Danielle?� 
�Yes Doctor.� 
�Now Danielle, when I place the collar around your neck you will become a
  dog,� a wry smile appeared on his lips, �you will become Missy. And you will
  remain Missy for as long as the collar is around your neck, do you understand
  Danielle?� 
�Yes Doctor.� 
Then he fastened the collar around Danielle's neck. 
�Missy, sit.� 
Danielle immediately dropped to her knees, sat back on her heels and spoke, �Arf,
  Arf, Arf.� 
Dr. Svenson thought, �Incredible she really is the perfect subject.� 
Dr. Svenson enjoyed another hour of fun, leading Danielle around on a leash,
  making her sit up to beg for treats and playing roll over. He woke her, again
  told her she would remember nothing but her diet regimen, and then sent her
  home. 
Danielle drove home confused as to why she was running an hour late. She also
  had some vague memory of finding something in her purse that should not have
  been there, but whatever that thing had been it wasn't there now. She shrugged
  her shoulders and drove on. 
Dr. Svenson spent his week thinking about what he could do next with his perfect
  subject. 
Danielle beamed with excitement, she had lost another two pounds and now she
  was only two pounds away from her ultimate goal. 
As their next regular session closed Dr. Svenson told Danielle to open her
  eyes. 
This time as she opened her eyes she saw Dr. Svenson holding Missy's collar
  in his hand, Danielle saw the collar and continued to stare blankly into space,
  but of course he had to make sure that she was in the deep trance he had desired.
  And so he again applied the hypo test to the palm of her hand, once again there
  was no reaction from his subject. 
Reassured, he fastened the collar around her neck and Danielle rolled off
  the couch landing on all fours and playfully started barking. �Arf, Arf, Arf,
  Arf.� 
The doc had another fun hour of playing with Missy, but before sending her
  home he was going to try and experiment. During the week that passed between
  visits he had determined that he should try to invoke some desperately needed
  changes in his favorite patient. 
Once again he returned Danielle to the couch, and he told her to sleep. 
Dr. Svenson removed the right shoe from his sleeping victim. �Okay, Danielle
  open your eyes and tell me what you see.� 
�That is my shoe doctor.� 
�That's right Danielle, but this is a very ugly shoe Danielle. On your way
  home I want you to stop at the very first shoe store you come to and buy a
  pair of shoes. Shoes with at least a three-inch heel. And when you get home
  I want you to go through your closet and throw out all of the shoes you own
  that look anything like this ugly shoe and replace them all with new shoes
  like the ones you are going to purchase on your way home tonight. Do you understand
  Danielle?� 
�Yes Doctor.� 
�Good girl, now close your eyes and sleep. When I snap my fingers and say �wake� you
  will wake-up feeling refreshed, you will remember nothing except your diet
  instructions. Do you understand Danielle?� 
�Yes Doctor.� 
Dr. Svenson snapped his fingers and said; �wake.� Danielle's eyes fluttered
  open, with a yawn and a stretch she got to her feet. While rising she happened
  to catch a glimpse of her shoes. 
�How did I ever manage to leave the house wearing these hideous things?� She
  muttered to herself. 
Dr. Svenson smiled sardonically. 
The next week Danielle showed up for her appointment still wearing her typical
  business pantsuit, but her flat conservative pumps had been replaced with the
  slinkiest looking black patent- leather sandals with 3 1/2&quot; stiletto heels. 
Dr. Svenson grinned smugly; he was very pleased with himself. And so, he slowly
  went about changing Danielle's entire wardrobe one item at a time. 
Two months later the young woman who kept her Thursday appoint with Dr. Svenson
  would hardly be confused for the fat girl with the beautiful face that had
  first come to see him about loosing some weight. 
Danielle had become a beautiful and confident woman. Her auburn hair no longer
  confined to the neat and prim little bun, now flowed about her shoulders. Gone
  were the pantyhose, white cotton briefs, conservative low-heeled pumps and
  most notably the gray flannel business pantsuits. 
Now she strode confidently into Dr. Svenson's office her tired old business
  pantsuit was now replaced by a little black dress of smooth, fluid jersey that
  had just the right amount of cling. And under her dress in place of her conservative
  white cotton under garments she wore a sexy little satin thong with matching
  bra and garter belt all in an flirty pink, with black dotted mesh overlay and
  trimmed with velvet bows and ruffled lace edges. The garter belt held up a
  pair of sheer and sexy stockings in a silky nude hue with a smooth finish,
  which had replaced her pantyhose. And in place of her conservative low black
  pumps she was now perched upon a pair of black T-strap pumps with four-inch
  heels. 
Their session proceeded as usual and at the end of reinforcing her dietary
  program he held out Missy's collar. Danielle stared blankly ahead, as he fastened
  the collar around her neck. Dr. Svenson no longer felt any need to use the
  hypo test on his perfect subject. 
He called, �Here Missy.� 
Danielle rolled off the couch landing on her hands and knees and crawled over
  to Dr. Svenson's desk. 
�Missy, sit pretty.� 
Missy sat back on her heels, arms pulled in, wrists limp and tongue panting. �Arf,
  Arf, Arf.� 
Dr. Svenson took a ball from his desk; the ball wasn't a tennis ball or an
  old baseball. The ball had been fashioned by taking a pair of Danielle's old
  white cotton panties and a pair of her old pantyhose and rolling them up into
  a ball. Using the panties as the core he then folded the pantyhose in half
  length-wise placed the wadded up panties at the toe then he rolled up the pantyhose
  when he reached the end he rolled the tops back on themselves. Just like the
  Army had taught him to do with his socks when he was back in basic training. 
He threw the ball across the room. �Missy, go fetch.� 
Missy eagerly retrieved the ball, returning with the drool-covered ball. She
  dropped it at Dr. Svenson's feet. Dr. Svenson had to chuckle, Danielle made
  quite a sight crawling around on her hands and knees in her slinky black dress,
  high heels and silky hose. 
�Good girl Missy.� He scratched her behind the ear as she panted, then he
  threw the ball again. They continued to play for the usual hour, and then he
  woke her and sent her on her way home as usual. 
Danielle drove home always feeling great after her sessions with Dr. Svenson.
  She did, however, wonder from time to time, how she managed to get so many
  runners in the knees of her stockings. But she had grown to accept the changes
  she experienced as her own conscious thought, and she persuaded herself that
  the unexpected occurrences, like the lost hours and runners in her stockings,
  were just happenstance. 
Dr. Svenson's game played on for nearly two years by giving Danielle post-hypnotic
  suggestions that kept her coming back week after week. Then Danielle suddenly
  announced that her next visit would be her last. She planned to move back to
  Nebraska and set up her own practice. 
John panicked he was beside himself. He knew that if she sought out another
  hypnotist sometime in the future that she might actually remember all the things
  he had done to her over the past couple of years. 
And besides that, he loved playing with Missy it was often the bright spot
  in an otherwise dull week. And so, at the end of this session instead of playing
  doggy with Missy he pumped Danielle for information. And she told him every
  detail of her planned departure. 
Dr. Svenson spent the week planning and contriving, until he had a working
  plan. 
Danielle showed up for what should have been her last session with Dr. Svenson.
  The session went as usual and when Dr. Svenson held up the collar Danielle
  continued to stare blankly off into space. But now there was no time for fun
  and games, he did not place the collar around her neck. 
�Danielle do you know what this is?� 
�Yes Doctor, it is Missy's collar.� 
�Danielle do you know what happens when I fasten this collar around your neck?� 
Danielle thought for a moment, and then responded. �Yes Doctor, I become Missy.� 
�Yes Danielle that is right, Missy's collar has a very magical effect on you.
  Doesn't it Danielle?� 
�Yes doctor.� 
�Danielle, the next time you see Missy's collar you will be fully awake. And
  you will feel an overwhelming compulsion to kiss this collar. Because you will
  be fully awake you may consciously try to fight the power of the collar, but
  the magic of this collar is very strong, and ultimately you will not be able
  to resist it. Then when you inevitably press your lips to the leather of this
  collar the magic of the collar will flow into you. And then once the collar
  is fastened around your neck you will become Missy again, but only for as long
  as the collar remains fastened around your neck.� 
Dr. Svenson repeated the mantra of the collar over and over until he felt
  sure it had been etched into Danielle's mind. Then he woke her and sent her
  home as usual. 
Danielle did not see Dr. Svenson again until the day of her departure. She
  was at the airport and had just finished checking her baggage in when she saw
  him. He waved to her and she nodded in recognition. He then motioned her to
  come over. 
�Dr. Svenson, what are you doing here?� 
�Danielle you don't know how much I shall miss you, you've become my favorite
  patient. I just have a little gift here for you. Can you come and join me for
  a cup of coffee, once you go through that gate I'll probably never see you
  again.� 
She knew she had over an hour before the flight, so she figured why not. �Okay
  doctor, but it'll have to quick they should be calling my flight soon.� 
He guided her to a small overlooked coffee shop tucked away in the corner
  of the airports concourse. John had done his homework well. They sat in a booth
  in a secluded corner of the shop, and he ordered two coffees. 
After the waitress served them their coffee he placed a gift-wrapped box on
  the table in front of Danielle. �Open it, it's a going away present.� 
Danielle loved presents so she opened the box eagerly. But as she opened the
  lid she saw Missy's collar. Suddenly the smile disappeared from her face. 
�It's Missy's collar. How did you get Missy's collar?� 
Danielle's face suddenly flushed red with anger; she felt somehow she had
  been betrayed. 
Then slowly her expression changed to one of confusion, for some reason she
  felt compelled to kiss the collar. She fought desperately with herself. She
  felt as though she had to kiss the collar, but then she would ask herself, �Why
  on earth would anyone kiss a dog's collar? It makes no sense.� 
Dr. Svenson sat there quietly watching Danielle's internal struggle. Finally
  after what seemed like hours (but had been really only a few minutes), Danielle
  could resist no longer and pressed her lusciously full lips to the red leather
  of Missy's collar. 
Danielle sat motionless in the booth unable to move of speak. 
Dr. Svenson said, �Danielle be a good girl and finish your coffee.� 
Danielle chugged it down as if it were a mug of cold beer instead of a mug
  of scalding hot coffee, her expression never changed. 
John smiled sardonically as he left the waitress a small but appropriate tip,
  and then guided the expressionless Danielle out of the shop. 
Once out in the concourse he led her to remote corner. First he removed a
  silk scarf from his pocket and tied it over her head, and then he placed a
  pair of large framed dark glasses over her eyes, finally to complete her disguise
  he removed his overcoat and placed it around her shoulders. 
Meanwhile, Danielle had been trying to figure out what had just happened to
  her. She had kissed that stupid collar. �But why, why it doesn't make sense.
  Who in their right mind kisses some stupid fucking dog collar?� And now she
  felt as though she were paralyzed. She could hear Dr. Svenson talking very
  clearly to her, but that was all she seemed able to hear, she wasn't able to
  move or speak unless he told her to. 
�Time to leave Danielle, come on you'll miss your plane.� 
As Danielle rose stiffly from the booth Dr. Svenson grabbed her by the arm
  and led her from the coffee shop. She hoped, as he had said he was taking her
  to the departure gate to catch her plane. But no, he led her to a corner and
  trapped her there instead. 
Danielle fought to understand. �Why is he covering my head with a scarf and
  the sunglasses, what's with the sunglasses? Why is he placing his overcoat
  over my shoulders? No, no the planes are the other way.� Her remained silently
  in her head as Dr. Svenson led her out of the terminal. 
Now he guided her out to the taxi stand and hailed a cab. 
Dr. Svenson gave the driver directions to the warehouse district down by the
  wharves; Danielle sat motionless and speechless next to him in the cab. 
She sat silently as her mind screamed, �Please Dr. Svenson let me out, take
  me back to airport, I'll miss my plane.� 
The driver dropped them off near the wharves. John watched him pull away before
  he walked Danielle another six blocks to the warehouse he'd had to rent for
  a month although he needed it only for today. 
Inside the warehouse stood a dog cage and a van. 
Danielle thought, �Now what on earth does he need a dog cage for.� 
Dr. Svenson removed the scarf and sunglasses from her face then retrieved
  his overcoat from her shoulders. 
�Now Danielle you may undress, you will have no further need of clothing.� 
�What the hell are you talking about doc, no need of clothing, I'll do no
  such thing. You'll have to tear this dress from my back. I dare you.� 
All the while she was protesting in her mind, she had been in perfectly silent
  compliance to John's command, without out uttering a word she went about removing
  her dress, her bra, her garter belt and stockings and her frilly little thong. 
When she stood completely naked Dr. Svenson gathered up her discarded clothing
  and placed them in the van, now he approached her with Missy's collar in his
  hand. 
�Well Missy, it's time. If you haven't remembered the magical powers of this
  collar you soon shall.� And then he fastened the collar around her neck. 
Danielle in the mean time was not accepting of it, �Wait a minute did he just
  call me Missy. No, No, No, I'm not Missy I'm Danielle. Missy had been my dog
  and I am not �� She did not finish the thought. 
As the clasp of the collar had been drawn closed around her neck a flood of
  memories suddenly rushed into her head. 
Danielle suddenly remembered everything, �The collar, it puts me into a deep
  trance, and, and when he fastens it around my neck I, I become Missy, NO, NO,
  NO he can't.� Then she heard it for the first time and it rang in her ears
  and incredibly it was coming from her own mouth, �Arf, Arf, Arf, Arf.� 
John saw the look on Danielle's face just before she had dropped to her hands
  and knees. That look had told John that Danielle knew everything. There would
  be no turning back now. Then with only the slightest twinge of remorse he removed
  a padlock from his pocket and locked it closed through the clasp. To Missy
  he said, �Stay girl.� Then John walked out onto the wharf and threw the padlock's
  key into the river. This change would be permanent. 
Danielle still fought to be Danielle. But there she sat obediently waiting
  for her master to return. 
Still in her mind Danielle battled, �He said I would be Missy only as long
  as the collar remained on my neck. He has to take it off some time, or maybe
  I can get it off. No wait, what's that in his hand a padlock what's he going
  to do with� NO, NO, NO, you can't. �Stay, stay', who is he telling to stay
  what does he mean stay, where is he going, why don't I follow him. He, he's
  throwing something in the river. NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, he can't.� The she sobbed
  silently to herself as she watched him return. 
�Well Missy that takes care of that, want to go for a ride?� 
Missy sat up pretty begging yes. 
Danielle protested, �Hell no, I don't want to go for a ride. Turn me back
  into Danielle you bastard.� 
�Good Missy, get in your cage and we'll be off, it's time you met my other
  pet.� 
Missy crawled into her cage, and then John locked the cage door and loaded
  the Missy laden cage into the van. 
�I'll good Missy him, let me out of this fucking cage. Wait, wait did he say
  he has another pet; you mean I'm not the first woman he's done this to. That
  fucking bastard.� 
Dr. Svenson pulled the van into his garage then unloaded Missy's cage. 
�We're home Missy.� 
He opened her cage door and let her out. Leaving the cage in the garage he
  opened the kitchen door. 
�Come on in Missy there is someone I want you to meet.� 
Missy slowly crawled cautiously sniffing and looking around, entering the
  kitchen and saw a smoky grey Weimaraner wagging its' tail and barking a greeting
  to his master. After jumping up on Dr. Svenson and giving him a big wet welcome
  home. He turned his attention to the new arrival, Missy. He sniffed her from
  head to toe, decided she must be okay and licked her on the face, and then
  he went back to his master. 
Danielle was awe struck, �It's, it's, it's Missy, but, but, but that can't
  be.� Then she got a better look at the Weimaraner, �Oh no, that is definitely
  not Missy. OH MY GOD NO.� 
�Well Missy say hello to Max. I've had him since he was a puppy some five
  years ago.� 
When John got home Max knew it was time to eat so the first thing on his mind
  after greeting his master was food. John didn't believe in canned food, so
  he cooked meat for the dog in a crock-pot while he was at work. Now Max had
  positioned himself right in front of the crock-pot looking up desiring its'
  contents. 
�Come on Max you know the rules, you eat when I eat. Yours' may be ready,
  but mine isn't. Go get acquainted with Missy while I fix my dinner.� 
He prepared himself a steak, a salad and some rice pilaf. When the preparations
  were done he set his food on the table, and then he filled Max's bowl with
  the stew that had been cooking all day. He didn't have a regular bowl for Missy
  so he grabbed a soup bowl ladled it up with stew and set it down beside Max's. 
Danielle thought, �This is really too much now he expects me to eat from a
  bowl on the floor with the dog.� 
�There you go girl, that will have to do for now I'll get you proper bowl
  tomorrow.� 
Max was already devouring his bowl of stew. Missy sniffed at it a few times
  before doing the same. 
John opened a bottle of Cabernet and settled down to his steak. 
Danielle was not ready to accept being John's pet dog. She could not believe
  how easily her Missy persona had adapted, and then suddenly she realized her
  Missy persona was just being Missy, the way that Danielle had remembered Missy.
  And that as Missy she was quite accustomed to being John's pet 
John cleared the table and filled the dishwasher. 
�Okay Max now let me fix you up with Missy. I know she doesn't smell like
  a dog yet, but she will before long. Missy, come here girl.� 
Missy padded her way over to John. 
�Good girl,� he patted her head. �Turn around girl.� 
Missy turned so that she faced away from John. 
�Good girl,� he patted her rump. 
Then he did something he had never done when he played with her in his office,
  he stuck his hand in her cunt working it in and out. 
Danielle protested. �NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO you can't do this to me. I'll,
  I'll �� 
Missy didn't seem to mind at all, in fact her ass started to sway a bit as
  if she were wagging her tail. Then John started probing until he found her
clit. He toyed with her clit until he could feel his fingers getting wet. 
Danielle's, �NO, NO, NO's.� Soon became, �OH, OH, OH, OH, OH, OH's.� 
Dr. Svenson removed his hand from Missy's cunt; he took a sniff of his dripping
  wet fingers and then called Max. 
�Max, here boy. Here you go boy.� He held his fingers up to the dogs nose. 
Max sniffed a few times then greedily licked his masters' fingers clean. 
�Good boy Max. Now, try this.� John slapped Missy on the rump. 
Max sniffed at Missy's ass and soon discovered the same smell permeating from
  a slightly lower position and started licking Missy's wet cunt, his long tongue
  swept over her pubic hair and cunt lips and managed to tickled her clit. 
Danielle protested again, �Oh no. You can't do this, no, no; you can't allow
  your dog to fuck me. NO, NO, please don't.� She silently sobbed to herself, �no,
no, please don't.� 
As the dog continued to lick Missy started to cum in a very big way. At that
  point Max didn't need any further coaching, He mounted Missy from behind, and
  it did not take him long to imbed his prick into her juicy cunt. When the knot
  of his prick expanded to its' full size they were locked together until he
  was finished with his task. 
But just as Danielle's protests of NO turned to OH as John fingered her clit
  her NO's again evaporated into OH's as Max humped away until finally Danielle's
  voice seemed to simply disappear from Missy's mind altogether. And she experienced
  the most fantastic climax she had ever experienced, or for that matter ever
  dreamt of experiencing. Missy panted in ecstasy for the first time in her life. 
Days later John read in his morning paper about a missing lawyer named Danielle
  Dawson who had vanished from the airport. It seemed Ms. Dawson's luggage had
  arrived in Omaha Nebraska on the fight she should have been on but no one remembered
  her being on the fight. The officials checked the flight records, finding that
  she had never boarded the plane. 
They searched the entire airport for the missing women and found nothing to
  go on. They interviewed a waitress who remembered a woman who could have been
  Ms. Dawson and yes she was with a man. But what had really stuck in the waitress'
  mind was the fact that the woman in question had chugged a mug of scalding
  hot coffee. John smiled, and thought he should have left a larger tip. 
The paper told of the police interviewing nearly everyone who had known the
  woman and anyone that had been anywhere near the airport that day. But aside
  from the clerk who checked her luggage, and the taxi driver who had dropped
  her off at the airport, no one could positively identify her. 
John was glad he had taken the precautions he had. 
The police eventually got around to questioning him as well; after all, he
  had been her doctor for over two years. But, he explained that he'd had no
  contact with the woman outside the office. And, the authorities could find
  no evidence that he had. Indeed, except for their brief encounter at the airport
  they'd had none. 
The authorities were baffled it seemed, the woman had vanished into thin air.
  At least she had not left a trail of any kind for them to follow. 
Finally because they could find no evidence of foul play and considering the
  fact that she was an adult over the age of thirty. The police had to drop their
  investigation and list her as a missing person. 
Meanwhile, John had required only a couple of weeks to train Missy to suck
  his cock. Her cunt would be Max's exclusive property, and her mouth would be
  the sole possession of her master, John. 
Life was great; Max had a new bitch that seemed to always be in heat. John
  still had a favorite pet that loved to play fetch with a wadded up pair of
  panties tucked inside a rolled up pair of pantyhose, and he now he had a warm
  mouth to use whenever he felt the need. Missy got to play with John and Max,
  she enjoyed sucking on John's dick and Max was the dog of her dreams fucking
  her wet cunt day and night. As for Danielle, well John thought, �Would the
  world really miss one more lawyer?� 
Missy would undergo a few other minor changes over the next few months. When
  Max kept getting pubic hair stuck in his teeth John decided to depilate Missy's
  cunt. Max even seemed to like her pussy better that way. Another change was
  that John had pierced her clit and a gold ring with a gold tag now dangling
  from it. The tag read Missy on one side and on the other side bore the inscription:
  Property of Max, the address, 523 Oak Lane, and the phone number 555-5555.
  It was the same as the tag that now hung from her collar, but of course that
  tag read Property of Dr. John Svenson, and the collar, well that would remain
  forever locked around her pretty little neck. 
The End 
Epilogue: 
Missy had been John's pet for a little over a year when John met Megan. 
Megan was a teacher at the local High School, and they had met through a common
  acquaintance. After only dating for a couple of months John knew Megan was
  the girl for him. Megan had wondered why John had always avoided taking her
  to his house. So after much soul searching John decided he had better bring
  Megan home to meet his pets. 
Megan was a real dog lover and took instantly to Max. Then John brought out
  Missy. 
John had expected a reaction, and Megan did not disappoint him. The sight
  of a naked woman crawling around on all fours sent Megan ballistic, she jumped
  to her feet and was about to walk out threatening to call the police as she
  went. 
John grabbed Megan by the arm turned her around looked deeply into her eyes
  and attempted to plead his case. 
Megan still fumed as she allowed herself to be led back to the sofa. John
  finally managed to coach her to the sofa and be seated. He quickly opened a
  bottle of Chablis he had chilling in the refrigerator and poured them each
  a glass. Then he desperately tried his best to explain. 
He told Megan that Missy was a former patient who had become lost in the fantasy
  of being a dog (of course he couldn't tell her the real story) and showed her
  that Missy was a pet, just like Max. He put Missy through her paces, fetching
  the ball rolling over, begging. Then he called Max over. 
Max as usual was up for the occasion; he started licking Missy all over before
  focusing on her cunt. He would have started humping his mate right then and
  there but John didn't think Megan was quite ready for that. 
Megan sat dumbfounded. �If this is a mental problem, why isn't she in a hospital
  getting help?� 
John was prepared. �She was, but they couldn't very well treat her like a
  dog in the hospital. She withdrew more and more from the doctors and nurses
  until one day she took shelter in a corner of her room growling and snapping
  at anyone who approached her, and refusing to eat. She was on the verge of
  starvation when I convinced them to let me take her home.� 
John's monotone delivery was so soothing that Megan soon started to accept
  his fantastic story as truth. 
Now that Megan's initial reaction had been subdued John took stock of his
  situation. He knew that if he left Megan to her own devices she would soon
  see through his ruse. And if she were to actually go to the police he would
  be in real trouble. But then, he had already considered this; the purpose of
  introducing Megan to Missy was to get Megan to accept Missy one way or another
  and now it was clear which way that would be. 
John opened a cigarette box that sat on the table next to the sofa picked
  up a cigarette and retrieving his Zippo from his pocket began to light up. �I'm
  sorry, Megan. Would you care for a cigarette? � 
Megan shook her head no. 
John made a show of playing with the lighter, flipping the lid open and closed.
  Megan finally, attracted by all the motion, noticed the lighter and the unlit
  cigarette. John held the lighter out to her in his open hand. 
�That's an interesting emblem on your lighter, what is it?� 
�It's the Military Intelligence insignia, my old Army Unit,� then he spun
  the flint wheel igniting the flame. 
Megan watched as John made a show of moving the flaming lighter around in
  front of her face. 
�Amazing isn't it. They made these lighters wind proof,� he continued to move
  the lighter rhythmically back and forth in front of her. When he saw that the
  flame had caught her attention he slowed down and began a monotone. 
�The flame is fascinating isn't it?� Megan did not respond but continued to
  stare at the open flame. 
�That's right Megan, look deep into the flame. It's relaxing, just sit back
  on the sofa, relax and look into the flame.� Megan nestled down into the sofa,
  and was unaware as John removed the wine glass from her hand, and she continued
  to stare at the Zippo's flame, fixated. 
�You are relaxed now, the flame is drawing you in deeper and deeper. Your
  eyelids are getting heavy, and you are starting to feel sleepy. But, you must
  fight to keep your eyes open. Yours eyelids are getting heavier and heavier,
  the harder you try to keep them open the heavier they become. You find it impossible
  to hold your eyes open. But you must fight; use all of your strength to keep
  your eyes open. The flame is now drawing you closer and closer to its' center,
  and as it does so it will begin to envelope you. Your strength is ebbing away
  with each passing second; you can fight it no longer. Your eyelids are so heavy
  now it is taking all of your physical strength to just to hold them open a
  sliver. The flame surrounds you now, let go, your strength is completely exhausted.
  Sleep, sleep, sleep.� 
Megan's head slowly rolled to one side. 
�Good girl Megan, sleep, sleep, sleep, deeper, deeper, deeper and deeper.
  As you sleep deeper and deeper you will begin to feel lighter and lighter.
  You will feel like you are floating. Good girl, float Meagan, float deeper
  and deeper into a trance.� 
�Good, very good Megan. Now I need your attention, so sit up straight.� Megan
  sat up straight on the sofa. �Now hold out your hand.� Megan extended her right
  arm. John had a syringe at the ready and now plunged it through the center
  of Megan's open palm. The entranced girl did not stir. 
�Very good Megan. You make an excellent subject. Now I need you to listen.
  I think you know why I invited you over tonight, but tell me why do think I
  invited you to my house?� 
�I believe we are growing together, I think you wanted to know more about
  you.� 
�Yes Megan. Now Megan, tell me what happened when I introduced you to Missy.� 
�I became very upset. It's not right to have a naked woman running around
  your house, even if she does think she is a dog.� 
John retold his doctored version of how Missy had become his pet. 
�Okay, now Megan you must overcome your prejudice against Missy. She is nothing
  but a pet and a mate for Max. From now on when you see Missy you will not see
  a naked women crawling around on all fours, you will see a smoky grey Weimaraner
  just like Max. You will treat Missy in the same way that you treat Max. Max
  and Missy are life mates, just as I hope that we shall be.� John repeated this
  mantra, �Missy is a smoky grey Weimaraner, she is not a naked woman,� over
  and over again. And then it was Megan's turn. 
Megan began to utter the mantra herself: �Missy is a smoky grey Weimaraner,
  she is not a naked woman.� 
John left Megan chanting her mantra: �Missy is a smoky grey Weimaraner, she
  is not a naked woman.� He refilled his wine glass, lit up his cigarette and
  relaxed as Megan chanted on. 
When he was satisfied that the mantra had been permanently inscribed in Megan's
  memory he told her stop. 
�You have done very well Megan. Now tell me what happened tonight.� 
�You invited me over to meet your two pets Max and Missy.� 
�Yes that is right Megan, and what are Max and Missy?� 
�Max and Missy are your smoky grey Weimaraners.� 
�Very good Megan, now do you remember your mantra?� 
�Yes, �Missy is a smoky grey Weimaraner, she is not a naked woman.� 
�Very good Megan. Now Megan you will forget the mantra until it is time for
  you to go to sleep at night, then it will return to you and you will silently
  chant it to yourself until you fall asleep, in the morning you will not remember
  the mantra until it is time for sleep again. Now after I snap my fingers I
  will say the word wake, and you will awaken from your little sleep. But you
  will remember nothing about tonight except meeting my two dogs and falling
  asleep on the sofa after having a glass of wine. Do you understand Megan?' 
�I met your dogs and fell asleep after a glass of wine.� 
�And what else?� 
�And at night I must chant my mantra: �Missy is a smoky grey Weimaraner, she
  is not a naked woman,' it will help me to fall asleep.� 
�Excellent,� John snapped his fingers, �Wake Megan.� 
Megan's eyes slowly fluttered open. �Oh John, I'm so embarrassed. I must have
  fallen asleep. That doesn't usually happen to me.� 
�That's alright Megan, it was only a minute or two and I caught your wine
  before it could spill on the sofa. You must have had a hard day at school today.� 
�I'm so sorry John, I forgot about the wine. Are you sure it didn't spill?� 
John merely smiled and shook his head; �Tell me now that you have met my pets
  what do think of them?� 
Just then Max and Missy came running back into the room. They made a fuss
  over John then went over to Megan seeking more attention. 
�John they are such wonderful dogs. They look enough alike to have come from
  the same litter.� 
John chuckled to himself, �Well, Missy is a few years older than Max.� 
Megan sat petting Max on the head and scratching Missy behind the ear, both
  of their heads now resting in her lap. She said: �I can't image why you worried
  about my meeting them. You know I love dogs, I just can't keep one in my apartment.� 
John drove Megan home that night and as she climbed into bed she could hear
  a buzzing in her ear. She tapped the side of her head as though an insect had
  flown in her ear. The buzzing continued as she yawned. When her head hit the
  pillow the buzzing started to become clear and she could hear it softly in
  her ear now: �Missy is a smoky grey Weimaraner, she is not a naked woman.� The
  phrase softly echoed in her head until she drifted soundly off to sleep. 
In less than a year John and Megan were married. But John was not satisfied.
  He loved to tinker, and his new wife was the object of his tinkering. It did
  not take long before John and Megan were expecting their first child. After
  the birth of their son, John Jr., John was able to �convince� Megan to give
  up her teaching career to be a stay at home mom. With the birth of a daughter,
  Danielle, two years later John decided it was time to get his wife into shape. 
Megan �allowed� her husband to use hypno-therapy to work out a diet and exercise
  regime that she could adhere to. Within four months Megan's was as fit and
  trim as she had ever been in her life. The schoolmarm and maternity clothing
  were relegated to Good Will. 
And on this particular day, this stay at home mom could be found chasing after
  John Jr., Danielle, Max and Missy wearing a cute little red dress of smooth,
  fluid silk that had just the right amount of cling to it. 
Her conventional undergarments having been replaced by a sexy little satin
  thong with a matching bra and garter belt all in a devilish red, with black
  dotted mesh overlay and they all were trimmed with black velvet bows and black
  ruffled lace edges. The garter belt held up a pair of the sheerest and sexiest
  black silk stockings, which had replaced her old pantyhose. And in place of
  her favorite running shoes she teetered upon a pair of black paten-leather
  T-strap pumps with four-inch heels. 
Most of Megan's friends slowly grew to accept her new appearance, but they
  found it difficult to understand how she managed to run after two kids and
  a dog (John was always careful to keep Missy out of sight from friends and
  neighbors) in this new choice of attire. They had no doubt that Megan was happy
  with her life. And needless to say John couldn't have been happier.
