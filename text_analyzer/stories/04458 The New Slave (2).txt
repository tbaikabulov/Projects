The New Slave

&nbsp;

Putting down my paintbrush, I looked at the
clock and saw I had only ten minutes until Master William would arrive.� I covered up the painting and put the brushes
away, thinking all the time about the strange direction my life had taken over
the last two years.� By the time I had
put away my paints and put on the handcuffs Master William insisted I wear each
time he visited, it was almost time. I felt the rush of fear I always felt
before he arrived and worst still, the helpless feeling I hated so much. He had
me in a trap and there was no way I could think of to get out of it, at least
not without causing some people I loved pain. I took a deep breath and knelt
down on the floor, remembering the first time I had knelt before him.

&nbsp;

Two years earlier.

&nbsp;

As I looked around the room, I could see
two naked girls preparing food in the kitchen and in the other room behind me I
knew there were more girls cleaning.�� I
tried to get my hands loose from behind my back, but like the last dozen times,
they stayed tightly bound.� I was
kneeling on a cushion, which at least made it a bit more comfortable then the
conditions I had been held in previously. The sound of a door shutting and
footsteps made all the girls squeal excitedly and run to kneel beside me on the
floor.� 

&nbsp;

There were five altogether and by the time
I could hear the footsteps enter the room, they had all put their hands behind
their head and had spread their knees so their private parts were on show.� I seemed to be the only one scared witless
and if it wasn�t for the gag I had been made to wear, I would have been
screaming for help. I tried to sit quietly but I could not help but whimper in
fear.� One of the girls beside me touched
her knee to mine and though it gave me some comfort, it didn�t ease my fear
any.� 

&nbsp;

She kept it there as the man moved around
and spoke quietly to each girl, the sound of their hushed whispers confusing
me.� Maybe this was someone else and not
their master, but why would they act like they had if he wasn�t the master.� My heart stopped as his shoes stopped in
front of me and a hand raised my chin to look at him. 

He was not hurting me but I could feel a
certain amount of pressure there too.�
�Who is this lovely creature? Slave Gina, can you fill me in on why she
is here?� I wanted to pull away from him, but even in his gentle grip there was
no give.� 

&nbsp;

�Master, she arrived this morning with that
card that is sitting on the bench behind her.��
He let go of my chin and went to read the card.� I began to shake, not knowing what he would
find out about me and how he would react.�
When he simply put the card down and smiled, I started to relax, but
then he sent the other girls except the one he had talked to about me away.� My fear returned as he pulled me up to my
feet and again lifted my chin so I had to look at him.� I was so scared I couldn�t help the tears
that started to run down my cheeks and flinched when he brought his hand up to
wipe them away.� 

&nbsp;

Despite the fact he had done nothing to
hurt me yet, I was sure it was only a matter of time before he did.� �Gina, take our new guest into my room and
I�ll be there soon.�� His room!� I just wanted to get out of there and the
last place I wanted was to be was in his room. �Love, don�t worry, it is not as
bad as it seems. Come on, be a good girl and don�t make me drag you.��� She seemed nice and I found my fear
lessening a bit as I let her lead me through the house to a large room with a
big bed and a large leather couch.� I
didn�t have any more time to look around as his footsteps entered the room
behind me.� �Gina I��

&nbsp;

Surprised as he stopped mid-sentence, I
felt his fingers gently touch my very sore bottom.� Even though he was trying not to hurt me, I
couldn�t help but moan as he turned me around to face him. I heard a gasp
behind me as Gina saw my bottom for the first time too.� �Gina, go and get that ointment on the top
shelf and a couple of painkillers.� I was then gently taken over to a large,
soft looking cushion. �Can you sit or would you rather kneel?� Though my knees
were sore from kneeling all morning, I knew I wasn�t able to sit yet.� �Kneel Master.�
Again his hand came to stroke my face, but I still flinched in fear that it
would bring me pain.� By the time I had
slowly settled down on the cushion, Gina was back with the ointment.� He took it and moved around behind me while
Gina knelt down in front of me and allowed me to lean on her shoulder while the
ointment was rubbed in. It hurt, despite the fact he was being very gentle and
I could feel my tears wetting Gina�s shoulder.��
Her hand rubbed my back, something that reminded me of being comforted
by my mother and this just made me cry even more.� I panicked as the gag was pulled back into my
mouth but then I realised he was pulling it back to undo it, and I sighed as I
moved my jaw to ease the ache there.� 

&nbsp;

While I cried softly, they both moved away
and talked quietly for a moment, before Gina left the room.� He came back and pulled up a cushion and sat
down in front of me.� I had gingerly
tried to lower my bottom onto my calves, but it still hurt too much.� Gina came back into the room with a glass of
water and what looked to be a life preserver from a boat.� However, it felt like heaven when he placed
it on my calves and I was able to rest my bottom on it, the ring in the middle
meaning I wasn�t putting all my weight onto my bottom.� He then had me take two tablets and sat back
and looked at me.

&nbsp;

His gaze made me feel nervous and I tried
again to get my hands free.� I hated the
helplessness I felt and just wanted to feel free again.� �Shh Slave, you are in no danger here.� Now, calm down and tell me your name.�� I could only stare at him. How could he call
me slave and then tell me I was in no danger?�
No matter how kind he was being now, I just knew that he would be as
evil as the man who had hurt me and then just gave me away. However, having no
wish to upset him, I focused on what he had asked me. �My name is Jill. Please
let me go home, I won�t say anything, please!��
I hadn�t meant to beg, but it just came out.� 

&nbsp;

The expected anger at my outburst didn�t
come; instead I could only see pity in his eyes.� He reached out and this time stroked my hair,
though I still flinched. �Jill, I am sorry but that is something that will not happen.
Your old life is gone and you can never return to it.�� The factual way he dismissed my old life just
made be cry again, thinking of all the people I would never see again.� I felt a soft hand on my shoulder and again
felt my head being lowered onto Gina�s shoulder.� This time she pulled me even closer and I
could feel her breasts rubbing against mine.�
The shock caused me to pull back and I looked to see a hurt look briefly
cross her face before she smiled gently at me.�


&nbsp;

My emotions were all over the place and I
just didn�t know what to think.� I had
not meant to hurt Gina�s feelings but the feel of her breasts on mine just felt
so wrong and the way he was looking at me just confused me even more. �Jill,
I�m sorry to be so blunt but it is best you know the truth. From now on you are
my slave and will refer to me as Master William or just Master.� Tell me you understand slave.�� �Yes Master.��
I so wanted to beg him over and over to let me go, but as he was being
so nice I didn�t want to risk making him change. He seemed to relax a bit at my
answer but then a look I couldn�t read crossed his face.

&nbsp;

�I need you to tell me about what happened
to your bottom.� I assume Master Tony did
it but it is important I know why.�� At
the sound of Master Tony�s name, I began to shiver and Gina put one arm around
my shoulder and squeezed gently. This time I didn�t pull away, her support
giving me the strength I needed to tell him about what Master Tony had
done.� �Master, I ..he..sorry but I don�t know where to start.�� Master William didn�t seem upset by my
stumbled answer. �Slave, I understand how it could be hard to tell me something
that could be personal but I need to know.�
How about if I ask you some questions, would that help?�� I nodded, happy to let him help me.� �First, how long were you with Master
Tony?�� 

&nbsp;

�Um, I think it was about a week but I�m
not exactly sure.� He seemed a bit surprised by this but did not pause in his
questioning. �Ok, tell me how you happened to be with him.�� My mind immediately went back to the day I
was captured. �I was walking home from a late class, having just missed the
last bus.� I knew I should have gotten a
taxi, but wanted to save the money and after a full day of classes I needed to
clear my head.� I was thinking of the
work I had to do on my next assignment when someone grabbed me and pulled me
into a van.� I must have been injected
with something, as the next thing I remembered was waking up with a pounding
headache.� I paused to take a breath and was glad when the glass of water was
held up to my lips to have a drink. 

&nbsp;

�I didn�t know where I was but it looked to
be some kind of warehouse. I became aware of voices behind me and of how I was
securely tied and began to panic.� To cut
a long story short, it was in the warehouse that two men came and took me to
Master Tony�s house.�� He seemed to be
thinking about what I had said, which gave me a moment catch my breath.� �Ok, so what happened at Tony�s house.�� 

&nbsp;

�I didn�t see him for the first two or
three days, being kept in a small room.��
The only contact I had was when I would be taken out for a while each
day to be taught how to kneel or address this guy I was expected to call
Master. On the day I met Master Tony, I was made to strip and show him my body.
He was mean and made me do the most embarrassing things.� I gasped, realising
this new Master could make me do the same things, but he seemed too intent on
my story to show any reaction.� �Anyway,
eventually he led me into his room and pushed me onto his bed. I don�t know why
I did it, but before I knew it, I had brought my knee up as hard as I could
into his balls.� To put it mildly, he
didn�t like it and by the time he had recovered, the same men who had taken me
from the warehouse, had tied me down to the bed on my stomach.�

&nbsp;

The re-telling of the story made me feel
like I was reliving the whole thing and I had to take a few more deep breaths
to continue.� I was glad of the feeling
of Gina�s arm around me, making me feel like I wasn�t alone for the first time
since I had been taken.� �Slave, you are
doing very well, go on now and finish your story.�� I looked at this man, my new Master, and
began to see how different he was from Master Tony, at least for the present
moment. �The next part is a bit sketchy, as all I can remember is being hit on
my bottom over and over until I must have passed out. When I came to, I was in
so much pain. I had no idea how long I had been out for but Master Tony was
still really mad at me and told me he didn�t think he wanted to waste his time
on me. That is how I came to be here.�� 

&nbsp;

I couldn�t bring myself to look up, feeling
embarrassed by what I had told him. �Slave, look at me.� Master Tony is.. well, I�ll just say we don�t agree on many things.� What he thought was a waste of his time I
think will be time well spent.� Right now
you are not ready or able to understand all that I will expect of you, but in a
little while, when you have healed, we will begin your training. Gina, I am
putting you in charge of our new slave here and trust that you will do a good
job.�� I looked up at the change in his
tone and saw his hand grip Gina�s hair as he pulled her head back.� This other side of him scared me and when he
let Gina go and reached out to stroke my hair, I kept waiting for him to do the
same thing to me.� However, all he did
was stroke my hair and leave the room.��
Gina then stood me up gently and led me to what would be my new home.

&nbsp;

Chapter 2

&nbsp;

For the next week, Gina looked after me and
my bottom began to heal.� I saw Master
William a few times over the week, but he only stayed long enough to make sure
I was healing alright.� When I saw him
again come into my room, I thought it would be one of the same flying visits I
had gotten used to, so I was surprised when he sat down on the end of the bed.
�Slave, kneel at my feet and be quick about it.�� All of a sudden I remembered why I was there
and felt my stomach flip with fear. I scrambled to kneel before him, my body
shaking. This time when he reached out, he did grip my hair and I had to pull
my head back or have my hair pulled out. It hurt and I could feel tears come to
my eyes. �Slave Jill, today you will start to know what being my slave is all
about.� Disobey me and you will feel pain
but try your best and you will be rewarded.� He let go of my hair and wiped
away the tears that were now on my face.

&nbsp;

Whether I liked it or not, I knew I had to
try to please him.� I didn�t feel that he
would react like Master Tony had, but I still had the sense that he wouldn�t
put up with any nonsense either.� �First,
I have been thinking all week about your beautiful body but now I don�t have to
just think about it.� Today, not only
will you begin to learn how to act as my slave but you will start to learn how
to please me with your body as well.��
This really scared me and he must have seen this, as he softened his
tone slightly. �Slave, don�t look so scared. I know this will not be easy for
you but it is want I want and you will be ok. I trust that my balls will be
safe?�� I looked up in surprise at his
words, but when I saw his smile I knew he was teasing me.� Again, I tried to work out this man who could
tell me I was going to be his sex slave one minute and crack a joke the next. 

&nbsp;

He pulled me to my feet and spun me around,
hooking his arm under my arms and pulling me back into his body. I could not
move away from him as he played with my breasts and then reached down to feel
my pussy.� Trying to squirm away, he just
hooked his feet around mine and I could not move at all. My breathing grew
short as his fingers tried to enter into my dry pussy. When he moved his finger
away from me, he leant down and whispered in my ear. �We will come back to that
later, baby.� I had no time to respond as he pushed me forward, grabbing my
wrists and tying them tightly.� 

&nbsp;

�Come with me, we have lost time to catch
up on.�� He gripped a nipple and began to
pull, making me powerless to resist him.�
I had to almost run to keep up with him as I was led down the hall to a
large room.� He let go of my nipple and I
sighed, at the same time I heard the door being shut and locked.� Spinning around to see what he was doing, I
took in the room for the first time.� On
the wall were all manner of whips and other things I knew were for use on his slaves.� I was frozen to the spot and even though I
knew the door was locked and he was standing in front of it, all I wanted to do
was run.� �Look at me slave, not at what
is on the walls.� Yes, over time you may
get to experience many if not all of them, but I will only be introducing you
to some of them today.� I know he was trying to calm me down but all he did was
to confirm my worst fears.� Not knowing
how I was going to cope with all he had planned, I found myself finding it hard
to breath and my legs felt weak. I started to feel
strange and began looking for somewhere to sit down.� Just as I started to think I might faint, I
found myself in his arms.� He sat me down
and leant me back against him.� �Shh,
take some deep breaths, that is right.� I tried to do
what he said, just so I could get my breath back. Gradually I began to calm
down and was able to breath again, though my bigger
problem was still there.� 



�Slave, has anything like that happened to
you before?�� The concern I heard in his
voice was so different from what I expected him to say, that I found myself
answering without thinking. �No Master.��
He pushed me to sit up on my own and moved so he could see my face.
�Tell me then why you reacted as you did.��
His stare was piercing as he waited for my answer.� �I am scared of what you will want me to do,
Master. I will try but please �� I couldn�t finish and just looked down waiting
for his response.� �Slave, I know you are
scared and I will try to talk you through what to expect but this is what I
want.� All of the other girls were scared
too at first, but they got used to it and so will you.�� I wondered if I would ever get used to being
a slave but felt some comfort in the fact that he seemed to be aware of my
fears. I saw his face grow serious again and knew I would now have to face up
to whatever he had planned �Ok, enough talking, lets get started.� 

&nbsp;

He pulled me up to my feet and moved me
over to stand near one wall and pulled my tied hands back to attach them to the
wall. I pulled and found I could not move away, as he went to get what looked
like a long stick. �Slave, this is called a spreader bar and today I will use
it to keep your legs spread.� He bent down and tied one ankle to the bar and
then made me stretch out my leg to attach it to the other end. My legs felt so
widely stretched I moaned as he attached it to rings in the floor. I could no
longer move in any way and started to feel my breath growing short again,
however this time I managed to control it before I had another attack.� Not thinking he had noticed, I was somehow
comforted when he stroked my hair back from my face. �Good girl, just keep
trying your best and I will be happy.�

&nbsp;

He would be happy!� I don�t know why but part of me was starting
to want to make him happy, though I am sure it was a touch of self-preservation
as well.� If he was happy, I would be
happy or at least that was what I hoped.�
He pulled a gag out of his pocket and I started to shake my head but he
took no notice. �Open up nice and wide for me.� I did and the ball was pushed
into my mouth. He pushed my head down and tightened the straps. �Good, try and
push it out for me.�� I did, not really
sure why. �I can see you are wondering why I am asked you to do that.� I want you to be able to feel the gag and for
it to block some sound but my intention in not to hinder your ability to swallow.� If the ball is in too far or it is too big,
you will have serious trouble.�� 

&nbsp;

He then moved away again and all I could do
was watch as he picked up a familiar object. It was just like what Master Tony
had used to hurt me so badly, though it looked to be a bit smaller.� I tried to beg behind the gag but only
muffled sounds came out.� As he
approached me, I began to shake and tried to get free.� Master William again stroked my hair until I
had calmed a bit. �Slave, I assume by your reaction that this was what Master
Tony used on you, but there are many ways to use a flogger and even many
different types of floggers.� I am not
saying this will not hurt you but I promise you will not be injured.� I may like to play and have my slaves suffer
for me, but I will never harm you in any permanent or life threatening
way.� I know that right now you may not
believe me but you just have to learn to trust me.�� 

&nbsp;

While I was thinking I could never trust
someone who was happy to hold me as a slave when all I wanted to do was go
home, I heard and then felt the flogger hit my stomach.� It did sting but it was not like the agony I
had felt when Master Tony had hit me.�
After each strike, Master William would rub the spot where he had hit,
allowing me time to get used to the pain.�
After a while, the hits got a bit harder and he did not stop so
often.� I was almost reaching a point
where it was getting too much when he dropped the flogger onto the ground.� He moved close to me and ran his hands all
over my body and then again tried to push his finger in my pussy.� I gasped as he managed to get his finger in
part of the way, but still he could not get it all in. 

&nbsp;

He spit on his finger and tried again and
this time he got it in and began to pump in and out. I tensed, his finger
feeling too big.� He pulled out and I
sighed.� �Slave, you need to relax and
let me get you ready for me or it will hurt more than it has to.�� I knew he was right but the thought of just
letting him do whatever he wanted without resistance still seemed wrong.� He left again and came back with something in
his hand, which he pushed against my clit and turned on.� I had used a vibrator before, but it did not
feel like this one did.� He used his
finger to push into me again and with the vibrator causing a sensation I could
not control, I was helpless to stop his finger or the orgasm I could feel
building.� 

&nbsp;

He was relentless and just kept the
vibrator on my clit until I could hold off no longer and my orgasm rocked
through me. It was a strange experience to orgasm with my body so tightly
restrained the way it was. Sometime during my orgasm he removed both his finger
and the vibrator, so that when I became aware of my surroundings once again, he
was not in front of me anymore. I took the break to reflect on the way he had
manipulated my body and had to accept that from now on it seemed that I would
not have any control over my own body anymore.�
The thought was overwhelming and I began to cry.� 

&nbsp;

I became aware of Master William�s hand on
my face as he raised it to look at me. He must have taken pity on me as he
reached around behind and took off the gag. I was still crying and just knew he
was going to ask me why.� �Slave, why are
you crying?� I took a deep breath and thought of what to say.� �I ..oh please don�t
make me tell you.�� I really didn�t want
to tell him what had made me cry, but when he picked up the flogger again and
hit me harder than before, I knew he again had the upper hand. �Ok, ok, please
stop. I will tell you.� He stopped but did not put the flogger down, instead
running it lightly over my body.� 

&nbsp;

�When you made me cum I just felt so�so
helpless and the thought of you being able to do that to me anytime you wanted
to just seemed too much.� He must have been satisfied
as he dropped the flogger back onto the floor.�
�Thank you for being honest with me, but next time I expect an answer
first time, no matter how private or embarrassing it may be.� I dropped my
head, another wave of helplessness washing over me. This time he let me be and
went behind me to loosen the rope holding my arms to the wall. �Kneel down.� At
first I didn�t know how I could with the spreader bar still in place but after
bending my knees almost to the floor, I found I could then move off my feet and
allow my knees to hit the floor.� 

&nbsp;

During my efforts to get to my knees, I had
not been aware of what he had been doing and got a shock when I looked up to
see his erect penis just inches from my face. �Slave, have you ever given a
blowjob before?�� I shook my head, hoping
that he would go easier on me.� �Ok, then
I will go slow this time, but don�t expect this every time.�� I had no time to think about what that might
mean, when he pushed the head of his cock into my mouth.� It felt big and heavy sitting on my tongue.
�Suck it but no teeth.�� I did as he
said, tasting his precum as I sucked on it. He patted me on the head and then
took a grip and held my head still.� The
next thing I knew he had pushed his cock further into my mouth until I could
feel it stretching my throat.� It hurt
and I began to gag.� No matter how hard I
tried to pull back to get it out of my throat his grip held me firm.� Finally he pulled out, giving me time to
breath and then pushed in again, this time working his cock in and out at a
steady pace. I was gagging with each push in and could feel tears on my face. I
don�t know how long it went on for, but finally he held my head still and began
to cum. I had no choice but to swallow.�
Once he had pulled out, I started to cough and didn�t seem to be able to
stop. I felt him hold a glass to my lips and greedily drank the water. 

&nbsp;

I felt emotionally drained and I let my
head drop down as he walked around behind me.�
However, he didn�t seem to be finished, as he pulled on my nipples and
then held up two nasty looking clips for me to see. �Do you know where these
go?�� I had an awful feeling that I did. �On my nipples Master?� He smiled and I knew I was right.
�These will hurt but I need to see how long you can take them for.�� I took a deep breath as he pulled one nipple
out and then closed the clip over it. It did hurt, my groans growing as he put
one on the other nipple as well.� He
picked up the flogger again and started to hit me all over my body. They were
not too hard but I still felt each one. When he was done, he dropped to his
knees and used his fingers in my pussy, making me feel like I was going to cum,
until he pulled them out and brought his fingers to my lips.� Knowing where they had been, I hesitated
before allowing him to put his fingers into my mouth. The taste was not bad but
I still hated the humiliation he was causing me.� He repeated this a few times before he
flicked the clamps with his finger. 

&nbsp;

I realised they were not hurting anymore
but by the look on his face knew there was something I was missing.� He went as if to unclamp one, but stopped.
�Slave, this will hurt but take a deep breath and it will soon be over.�� I took a breath, but was not ready for the
pain that radiated all through my nipple.�
He quickly removed the other one and I wondered what torture he had in
mind for me next.� With my eyes closed I
could feel him untying my ankles from the bar and then my hands, pulling me up
to stand when I was free.� �Slave, you
did very well today and I am going to reward you with an hour�s rest before you
start to help out with the household chores.��


&nbsp;

We walked out of the room and I saw Gina
waiting on her knees.� When she saw us,
she straightened up and Master William lifted her up to her feet by her
hair.� I was not used to seeing woman
being treated that way and it still made me feel uneasy. �Gina, take Slave Jill
to her room and give her some lunch. After that she can have an hour�s rest
until she starts to learn her household duties.�� We started to walk off, when Master William
stopped us. �Oh, slave, I will see you later to
continue your education. I am looking forward to finding out if that pussy is
really as tight as it seems.�� I was so
embarrassed by not only what he had said but the way he had said it.� It was as if my feelings were not even
important, but then he was making me his slave, so I guess they weren�t. On the
way back to the room, I tried to take note of my surroundings, just in case I
had the opportunity to get away.� There
was no way I was going to spend the rest of my life as a slave!

&nbsp;

Chapter 3 

&nbsp;

After letting me have a shower and then
some food, Gina told me to lie down and have a rest, but all I could think
about was what he had said before. No matter how much nicer he was then Master
Tony, he was still holding me against my will and I just wanted to be
home.� I tossed and turned on the bed, my
mind just not letting me rest.� Gina came
down and sat on the bed near me, her hand settling down on my shoulder. 

&nbsp;

�Jill, you really need to take advantage of
any rest breaks you earn.� Master William
may be hard but he does recognise when one of his slaves has done a good job.
He must have been very pleased with you to give you an hour off.� I didn�t care
how pleased he might have felt. �Oh yeah, I should be pleased that he gets to
keep me here and treat me anyway he wants to.� For the first time since my
whole nightmare had begun, I was starting to feel angry.� I was still scared of what might happen but I
was beginning to think about how unfair it all was.� �Gina, why do you act so happy to be naked
and made to do whatever he tells you to do.�
Don�t you just want to say no sometimes?�� 

&nbsp;

She looked at me and I saw not anger but
sadness in her eyes. �Jill, I understand this is all new to you, but you need
to calm down.� I looked at her like she was crazy. Calm down!� I had just started.� �Gina, please be honest with me.� Haven�t you had times when you just wanted to
fight back or get away from here?�� This
time I could see her expression change and she moved closer to me. �Jill, I used
to feel the way you are feeling now, but it got me nowhere.� Believe me, you have
to learn to keep how you are feeling to yourself. I know you don�t want to be
here and you are scared, but as you know, there are
worst Master out there.�� I didn�t want
to think about that and tried again. 

&nbsp;

�Surely though, you want to make your own
choices and .. Oh God, I don�t think I can do this.
This morning, I just felt so used and helpless. How do you get over feeling
like that?�� Gina lowered her voice and
made me look at her.� �Love, I spent the
first few months here feeling the same way. I hated how helpless I was and how
he would use my body anytime he wanted to. I had been abducted just like you,
but I was abused by the men who abducted me before Master William took me as his own. I was angry and tried to fight him, but over
time I learnt that he was different and even though he did make me a slave, he
also rewarded me.� It may sound strange
to you now, but eventually you will live for those moments when he notices how
good you have been doing.�� 

&nbsp;

We both jumped as the door opened and
Master William walked in.� I hoped he
hadn�t heard us and hugged my knees up to my chest just like I used to when I
was a child.� �Gina, it is time to show
our new slave what she needs to do, however I need to talk to her first, so
wait for me in the lounge room.� I felt a shudder go through me at the thought
he had heard me and Gina talking.� When
Gina was gone, Master William came and sat on the bed beside me.� �How are you feeling after this
morning?�� I hadn�t expected him to care,
so his question took me by surprise. �I am ok.��
�Good, I was worried about how you might be feeling. The first time
being controlled can be hard, especially when you just want to say no.�� I jerked around to look at him, sure now he
had heard what I had said to Gina. �I ..I.. please.�
He pulled my hair back hard and as I yelped he took my chin in his other
hand.� 

&nbsp;

�First I think you have forgotten
something.�� �Master, I�m sorry, I
forgot.�� He eased his grip a bit but
still held my head firm. �Now slave, there is something you need to
understand.� No matter how much you may
want to, saying no to me is not a good idea.��
I grew angry again at his words but took Gina�s advice and kept it to
myself. He let go and I sighed, glad that I had managed to stay in control,
which was funny as it was the only thing I actually had control over. �Ok, it
is time to get going.�� I was pulled up
and taken through the house, again trying to take in as much of the layout as I
could.� 

&nbsp;

Gina had a vacuum and a selection of
dusters and cloths ready for use. Before he left, Master William connected me
via a long chain tied around my ankle to a ring in the corner of the room,
meaning I could only move around the room.�
My afternoon was spent cleaning part of the house and I could not help
but notice that Gina was very quiet.� I
hoped she was not upset by our discussion earlier, as she was the only friend I
had.� Each time I tried to speak to her,
she would just shake her head and carry on with her cleaning.� Shaking off the chain that had hooked around
my feet, I sat down to catch my breath, just as Master William returned.� 

&nbsp;

�Well, well, so this is how you�ve been
spending your time.� I jumped up to say I had been working all afternoon, only
to see him smiling.� �I can see you have
both done a good job, so you may go and have a snack in the kitchen before
helping to prepare the evening meal.�� He
bent down and freed my ankle and then stroked my hair before heading off down
the hallway.� I looked up and saw that
Gina was busy putting the vacuum away.� I
started to back quietly away, hoping that she would not look up and see me and
before I knew it, I was in the next room.�


&nbsp;

With no one around, I took the chance and
started to run through the room, looking for a way out. I could hear shouting
behind me and knew that my absence had been noticed. I ran even faster and saw
a door at the end of the hall.� I had
almost reached it when a hand come out of nowhere and grabbed me around the
waist.� Screaming to be let go, I was
lifted up of the ground and carried back into the room I had come from.� I was lowered back to the ground but no
amount of kicking or squirming could make the guy let me go.� I could see Gina looking on in concern and a
number of the other girls poking their heads around the door.� 

&nbsp;

I didn�t care how much they looked on or
tired to make me be quiet as they shook their heads and held hands to their
lips. Suddenly all the room hushed as a door slammed and I could see Master
William striding down the hall. I increased my efforts to get free but found
the guy holding me just gripped me tighter. I know I should have been scared
but I was just angry.� Even as he came
closer, I still tried to kick out, barely missing Master William.� I heard gasps from the other slaves as I
continued to fight, until I a felt an explosion in my cheek and I realised he
had hit me. I had never been hit before and it just made me even angrier.
�Don�t touch me, you bastard. Let me go!��
He didn�t seem to like my outburst and slapped my other cheek. Before I
had time to recover, he dragged me down the hall by my hair.� Despite the pain, I tried to claw his fingers
away, but his grip was firm. Inside I was fuming and was determined that he
knew it.� 

&nbsp;

He opened a door and letting go of my hair,
almost threw me inside, causing me to end up in a heap on the floor. I had no
sooner hit the ground then he was dragging me up again and I was pushed to sit
on a chair. I went to stand up only to be pushed down again. �Slave, you are in
enough trouble, don�t make it any worse.���
I should have listened to him but instead pushed back and as he
stumbled, I tried to make it to the door. The pull on my hair stopped me and again
I ended up on the floor.� �Stay there or
you will be sorry.� This time I did take his advice, if only to catch my
breath.� I was still angry but decided to
cool it for a while and hope I could catch him off guard again.

&nbsp;

He was walking around me, looking to be
trying to decide what to do with me. �Slave, I must say I didn�t think you had
it in you, but I can�t let you get away with behaving like that in my
house.� Get up!�� I stood, starting to feel some fear as I looked
at how serious his face was.� �I had
hoped I would not have to punish you so early in your training but you don�t
always get what you hope for.�� Taking a
hold of my arm, I just couldn�t let him take me off to punish me without
letting him know what I thought of him and his rules.� �Let me go.�
You may be able to boss everyone else around but I won�t let you do it
to me.� It was silly I know, but I just needed to vent some anger.

&nbsp;

He just sighed and continued to pull me out
of the room and into another part of the house I had not seen before. The more
we walked, the darker it seemed to get and I realised there were no windows to
let any light in.� I tried to pull away,
sensing that whatever he had planned would not be good.�� He stopped in front of a
old wooden door and pulled out a big key to open it.� �Please Master, I am sorry. Please give me
another chance.� I don�t know why, but without even seeing what was inside, I
just knew it would be awful.� Master
William just ignored me and pulled me into the room. 

&nbsp;

It was small and dark, with no windows and
only the one door. As my eyes started to grow accustomed to the darkness, I
could make out things hanging from the walls.�
Panicked, I turned to run but only meet his chest as he blocked the
door. Turning me around, he walked me over to the middle of the room where I
saw for the first time�
the rings in the floor and the chain hanging down from the
ceiling. My hands were brought up over my head and attached to leather straps
that were hanging on the end of the chain. My feet were spread slightly and I
was surprised that he hadn�t pulled them out like he had this morning.� I soon realised why though, as after he had
tied them with rope to the rings in the floor, I began to feel my body being
pulled up until I was almost on my toes.�
The last thing he did before leaving me alone was to put in a gag, the
size bigger than the one I had worn that morning.� 

&nbsp;

I cried as he slammed the door shut, his
silence almost as bad as the ache that was already starting to form in my
toes.� For a while, I tried to count the
minutes in my head but after forgetting what I was up to numerous times, I gave
up.�� That was when I noticed how quiet
it was, the only sound my own ragged breathing.�
I heard footsteps and the door opened again.� Master William held up the flogger and then
without a word to me, starting to use it all over.� I had nowhere to go while the flogger stung
my body, though thankfully he did not concentrate on any one area for too
long.� By the time he stood back and
looked at me, his own breathing rapid, I was warm all over.� He went behind me and I felt relief as my
heels were allowed to touch the ground.

&nbsp;

Hoping my punishment was over, I cringed
when he came back around in front of me and held up the nipple clamps in front
of my eyes.� I was worried that he hadn�t
spoken to me yet, but was even more worried about the clamps.� My head shook at he applied them to my
nipples, the ache every bit as bad as I remembered from that morning.� I screamed as something was added to the
first one and then the other, looking down to see a round ball hanging from
each clamp.� Looking up to Master
William, I hoped he would take pity on me but he was already half way out the
door.� 

&nbsp;

The banging door meant I was alone again,
this time trying to deal with the pain in my nipples.� I could feel the tears running down my face
and had to work hard to keep my nose clear so I could still breath.� I wanted for the feeling to go away, but it
seemed to be taking a long time.� Maybe
the fact that each movement of my body would send one or both of the balls
swinging and pulling down on my nipples didn�t help.� I was left alone for what felt like a long
time.� When the door opened and again
Master William entered the room, I didn�t look at him until I felt a burning
sensation on my upper leg.

&nbsp;

Looking down, I could see he had something
that looked like a wipe of some kind that got thinner as it got to the end.
Whatever it was, it hurt and each time it made contact with part of my skin, I
had to scream.� I could see thin, red
lines where he had used it on my upper body and when he used it on my breasts,
the combination of the weights and the sting, was just
too much and I screamed as loud as I could.�
Breathing hard, I was still hurting when he removed the gag. Breathing
deeply, I didn�t speak, not wanting to bring on any more pain.� 

&nbsp;

Master William swung each of the balls and
I couldn�t stop another scream from coming out of my mouth.� �Slave, if you can not scream while I do that
again, I will take them off. Otherwise, they will stay there for longer.�� I didn�t think I could take them for much
longer, so I took a breath and gritted my teeth as the pain ran right through
my body. �Good girl, you might just make a good slave yet.�� I had to bite my tongue not to reply, not
wishing to spent a moment longer than I had to in the
small, dark room. �As promised, I will take these off, are you ready?� 

&nbsp;

I wasn�t but I knew it had to be done, so I
just nodded.� He removed the balls first
and then I drew in a deep breath as he took of the first clamp.� The pain was even worse than I expected and I
had to clench my fists together to deal with it.� He gave me a moment to get prepared for the
removal of the other clamp and it was no better, though at least now he was
gently rubbing my nipples.� �Slave, I�m
sorry you had to suffer so much so early in your time here, but I do hope it
will be an experience you will not forget in a hurry.� I hung my head as the
feeling of being helpless washed over me again.�


&nbsp;

Master William moved to release me and
untied first my legs and then my arms.� I
was stiff and would have fallen to the floor if he had not supported me.� I could feel the muscles moving under his
shirt and shivered as I thought of what he had promised to do tonight.� I was in a kind of a daze as he helped me
back to my room, vaguely aware of the other slaves trying not to look as I went
past. When we got to my door, I expected him to just leave me there alone, but
he came in and made me lie down, while he sat on the bed beside me.� I wondered if this was when he would continue
my education, as he had put it, however it seemed he had not yet finished his
lecture.

&nbsp;

�Slave, do you know what will happen to you
if you try anything like that again?� I just shook my head, wishing he would
leave and let me sleep.� �Next time, not
only will your time in the room double, but your suffering will increase. It
may sound hard but it is for your own good.��
I looked at him, wondering what good he was talking about, but he kept
on talking so I could not ask him. �You need to understand there is no leaving
here, at least not while you are so new to the house. In time, if you prove to
be trustworthy, you will find that I am not adverse to you having a hobby or
something you can do in your free time.�
And sometimes I choose a slave to come with me on trips away but you
have to earn that right.�� 

&nbsp;

I tried to fit the image of me as a slave
travelling with Master William, but kept coming back to the same thing, I would
still be a slave.� Closing my eyes, I
heard him sigh and then stand up. �Slave, I will let you rest now, but someone
will be along in a short while with some food and then I will see you
tonight.�� He almost sounded sad but I
didn�t have time to reflect on it as I drifted off to sleep.

&nbsp;

Chapter 4

&nbsp;

I awoke to the sound of the door opening
and an aroma that made my mouth water.�
Gina was just putting a tray of food down on the small table as I sat
up, her look one that I had seen on my mother�s face many times. I could tell
she was mad at me and suddenly wondered if she had also been punished for allowing
me to try to escape. �Gina, I�m sorry about before, I hope you didn�t get into
trouble.� She just looked at me and brought the food over.� Her hands were shaking so I knew something
was wrong.� Ignoring the food, even
though I was starving, I tried again. �Gina, something is wrong, please tell me what it is.�� 

&nbsp;

This time she started to cry and it was my
turn to comfort her.� �Oh Gina, please
tell me.�� Finally she sat down on the
bed and brought her hands up to cover her face.�
She was really starting to worry me and I felt fearful of what she going
to say.� Gradually, her tears eased and
she was able to talk. �Master William said it was my fault you got loose in the
house and said he is going to make an example of me. I don�t know what he is
going to do but he said I will find out tomorrow.�� I felt terrible. �Oh God Gina, I didn�t even
think about what could happen to you.� I
am so sorry, I just saw a chance to get away and had
to try it.� I went to put my arm around her but she shrugged me off. �Jill, I
know you didn�t think but you have to start to be aware that we are a family
here and what one person does can have consequences on the others. Now you need
to eat your meal before it gets cold.�� 

&nbsp;

She rose to go and as much as I wanted to
beg her to forgive me, I knew she had a right to be angry with me.� I thought about what I had done while I ate,
while also wondering what might happen to Gina tomorrow.� The one good thing was that it stopped me
from worrying about Master William using my body tonight.� Once my meal was finished, I looked at the
marks left from my punishment and saw a series of thin red lines covering my
body, but there was not a lot of pain.�
Just as I was in the middle of trying to see what marks were on my back,
a girl I had not seen before came into the room.

&nbsp;

�Jill, I am slave Marie, Master William had
asked me to prepare you for him tonight. I am sorry but I have to use this.�
She held up what looked like a pair of handcuffs with a chain attached to
it.� I held out my hands and let her cuff
them, not wanting to get her into trouble like I had Gina.� I followed Marie to a large bathroom where I
showered and my hair was blown dry until it was soft and fluffy.� The closer it got to my time with Master
William the more nervous I was getting.�
It was not that I had not been with a man before but it had always been
consensual and after today I had to be prepared for anything.� �Jill, it is time to go. Just do as he says
and you will be ok.�� I wanted to ask
more but she was already off down the hall with me stumbling behind her.� 

&nbsp;

My stomach was churning the closer we got,
so that by the time Marie was knocking on the door, I was a nervous wreck.� The door opened and Master William took the
chain out of Marie�s hand, his fingers brushing her breast before she left with
what looked to be a spring in her step. There was no time to ponder this as I
was pulled into the room and made to stand, his gaze making me feel like a
prize he had won.� The more he looked the
more nervous I got, until his hand on my shoulder made me jump. �Hey, settle
down, I only wanted to say how beautiful you look. I know you have had a bad
afternoon, but I am not angry any more. So long as you behave and we have no
more outbursts, you might even enjoy it too.��


&nbsp;

I just couldn�t relax and tensed up again
as he led me to sit on the bed.� Master
William reached up and I flinched again, causing him to sigh and stand up.� �Slave, you have to relax. This isn�t your
first time is it?�� Although it felt like
it was, I shook my head no.� �Ok, maybe
you need to tell me about your experiences with men.�� He sat down on a seat opposite and waited for
my response.� I tried to clear my mind
and think of what to tell him.� He
started to tap his foot in impatience and gave me a look that warned me to
hurry up. 

&nbsp;

�Master, I have been with only two men but ..� I had to stop, embarrassed by what he was making me tell him.� �Come
on, I am not interested in spending the whole night talking.�� Taking a breath, I couldn�t look at him while
I continued my answer. �I meant to say I have had two boyfriends but I am not
very experience Master.�� It was not
something I had told many people, in fact only my best friend knew.� �Why, what was wrong with them? If� I had been your
boyfriend, I would have been fucking you all the time.� I looked at him,
shocked by what he had said.� �It wasn�t
them, it was me. In fact they both dumped me because I didn�t want to sleep
with them all the time.�� 

&nbsp;

I could feel my face burning as I thought
about what I had told him.� It was the
reason I had not had a boyfriend for over a year, not wanting the rejection I
had felt before.� Becoming aware of his
standing again before me, I flinched as his hand came to rub my cheek, not
wanting to look at him.� �Slave, look at
me.� It sounds like you need a real man
to show you how beautiful and sexy you are.��
With no warning, he pushed me back onto the bed and straddled me.� My hands were still cuffed in front of me, so
it took him no time to have my arms secured to the top of the bed.� He knelt up and removed the robe he had on,
his body naked underneath.� His hand then
went to my pussy and he pushed his finger in, not even giving me time to try and
move away.� He seemed to not want to give
me any time to think or react as he added another finger to my pussy.� I was surprised to find my pussy moistening
under the pressure of his fingers and my breathing getting short. 

&nbsp;

Another sudden movement saw him pulling out
his fingers and replacing them with his cock.�
He was partly in before I could even scream and as he surged forward, I
found my breath knocked out of me at� the force of his thrust.� He continued to pump away, his body rubbing
against mine causing sensations to rush through my body.� I didn�t want to feel the emotions he was
making me feel and tried to think of anything other than what was happening. It
was not working as I felt the familiar tingling that meant an orgasm was
close.� I could feel his cock going where
a cock had never gone before but it was his fingers that pushed me over the
edge.� He found my clit and moved his
fingers in a circular motion until there was nothing to do to stop my orgasm. 

&nbsp;

I came, just at the same time as he pulled
out and started to cum all over me.� His
cock was placed at my lips and he pushed it in, again not allowing me any time
to think.� I gagged as it stretched out
my throat and I was made to swallow the last of his cum. Pulling
out, he lay down beside me, leaving me breathless.� After a few minutes, he propped himself up on
one arm to look at me. �Now, if those boyfriends of yours had only taken what
they wanted, who knows what could have happened.� My anger started to rise
again as what he had said sunk in, but then a man who could hold someone
against their will would think like that.�


&nbsp;

He stood up suddenly and went to get
something out of a box in the corner.�
Expecting him to bring something else to torture me with, it just looked
like he had a feather in his hand. Not trusting him, I watched as he then
pulled a strip of black material out of his pocket.� �No, please, let me see Master.�� My talking got me nothing but a slap on my
breast and the blindfold was tied over my eyes regardless.�� I held my breath not trusting him at all and
soon he was running the feather over my body.�
I fought the urge to relax under the soothing feather, sure that soon
there would be pain. I gasped as the feather was run up and down my pussy slit,
the feather causing me to squirm on the bed.�


&nbsp;

His hand on my breast made me jump and he
started to pull the nipple out, while the feather continued to tickle my pussy.
I couldn�t believe how he could make my body react the way it did and had to
fight not to cum again.� Just as I was on
the verge of orgasm, both his hand and the feather were removed. Moaning in
frustration, I wasn�t prepared for the pain when it came.� He was hitting me with something, moving all
around me, never hitting the same spot twice.�
Each hit was followed by a shriek from me and I was finding it hard to
catch my breath.� I was aware of him
putting something down on the bed and then his hand came down over my mouth.
His other hand was now rubbing my clit and I tried to shake my head to get some
air.� He must have lifted a few fingers,
as I was able to take a breath before the air was blocked off again.� My orgasm was close as his fingers now moved
into my pussy and began to pump. He let me get some more air before his hand
again closed over my mouth. I was so close to cumming and my chest was getting
tight as I fought to get more air.� I
cursed him in my head as his fingers continued to pump.� He let me get some more air, but not enough
to fill my lungs as I began to cum.� 

&nbsp;

His hand continued to block my air as I
shook, the feeling like nothing I had felt before.� He seemed intent on not letting me rest as
even before the orgasm had ended, his cock was again pumping away inside me. He
removed his hand and I sucked in the air, still not getting all I needed.� I thought he would just continue until he
came again, so I was surprised when he pulled out.� My legs were picked up and pushed back up
until I thought he must have been trying to dislocate my hips.� �Please Master, it is too much.� He didn�t
reply and soon I heard him lock something around each ankle.� As much as I tried to lower my legs, they
would not budge.� 

&nbsp;

However, I soon forgot my legs as I felt a
finger on my asshole. �No!� Don�t.�� I froze as I realised what I had said and
felt the slap on my bottom before I could say anymore.� �Slave, I think I need to gag you.�� I knew better than to argue as the bed rose
and his footsteps moved across the room.�
When he came back and held the ball to my mouth, I let him slid it in,
hoping that by not fighting it he would not put it in too tight.� It didn�t seem to help much, as my whole
mouth was filled and the straps pulled tight. Then his hand returned to my ass.


&nbsp;

�Slave, am I right in assuming that you
have never had anyone fuck you in the ass
before?�� I nodded but it didn�t mean
that his hand was removed.� �Since this
is new to you, I am just going to use a butt plug.� In time, you will stretch out enough to take
my cock.�� I breathed in relief but then
wondered what the plug would be like.� I
didn�t have to wait long as he squirted something cold into my ass and then
something hard was placed on my hole.� I
had nowhere to go as he pushed the plug in bit-by-bit, allowing me some time to
get used to but not enough to make it any less painful.� By the time he had it inside of me, I felt so full and was begging him behind the gag to take
it out.� 

&nbsp;

�I know you want me to remove it but you
have to get used to it.� Now, I will not
make you wear it for long if you do something for me.� I nodded again, eager to
get it out of me, though fearful of what he might want me to do. �Good, now the
sooner you can make me cum the sooner I pull it out and you can get some
rest.�� I didn�t know how he expected me
to make him cum, unless he removed the gag.�
When I felt his cock resting in my cuffed hands I realised he wanted me
to jerk him off.� I tried to get a good
grip, but it was hard the way my hands were tied and the angle of his
body.� As I was desperately trying to get
my hands around his cock, I felt a sting on my breasts. �Come on slave, I am
sure you can do better than that. Maybe you need some added motivation.� The slower you go, the harder I will hit
you.� 

&nbsp;

I managed to get his cock in a better grip
and tried to move my hands fast enough to make a difference.� It rubbed the cuffs on my wrists but the
alternative was even worse, so I kept it up and could feel his cock firming
up.� Pleased I was making some progress,
I tried to think about how good it would feel when he took the plug out. I must
have slowed down, as my breast was hit again.�
Focusing back on the task at hand, I worked his cock until I could hear
him grunting and knew he was close.� When
I felt the sticky cum on my fingers I sighed and kept on pumping until he moved
his cock away.� 

&nbsp;

�Well done slave, as promised I will now
take out the plug and you can go.� It was as painful coming out as it was going
in and I felt dizzy, my head spinning as he removed the blindfold.� I didn�t open my eyes as he freed my legs and
then my hands, the gag coming out last.�
Even when I was able to move I didn�t, my head still feeling dizzy.� �Slave, look at me.�� I opened my eyes, the room spinning and had
to close them again. �I�m sorry master, I just feel really dizzy.� Not knowing
what his reaction would be to me disobeying him, I tensed as I felt his hand on
my cheek.� However, he only rubbed it gently.
�Take your time, you have had a big day. Maybe it
would be better if you just stayed here tonight.�� My head was starting to clear but I felt so
tired I didn�t say anything as he removed my hands from the cuffs, rubbing them
gently before he lowered them down by my sides.�


&nbsp;

It must have been hours later when I woke,
desperate to go to the toilet. Not wanting to wake him, I started to get up
when I was pushed back down onto the bed by his arm over my chest. �Slave, I
hope you are not trying to get away?��
Even in his sleepy state, he still demanded attention. �No Master, I
just really need to use the bathroom.�� I
was starting to get desperate and hoped he would allow me to go. �Ok, but I
need to attach the chain again.�� He was
sitting up now and returned the cuffs to my wrists and held onto the end of the
chain as I went into his bathroom and relieved myself.� I was careful to be fast and not give him
time to wake up properly, not wanting him to decide to use me again.� 

&nbsp;

Back in bed, I was relieved when he just
rolled back over, however he had not removed the cuffs and I felt them rubbing
as I tried to get back to sleep. As hard as I tried though, my mind was just
full of the events of the day.� I must
have been moving around as Master William�s hand came over down over mine.
�Slave, go to sleep or I might have to find something else to do with our
time.�� �Sorry Master.�� I lay still, not daring to move as the night
went on and eventually exhaustion took over.

&nbsp;

Chap 5

&nbsp;

I opened my eyes to see Master William
walking back into the room, his hair wet.�
�Good morning, slave. I thought I was going to have to wake you up. Get
up and have a shower, we have a another big day ahead
of us today.�� I was half way into the
bathroom when I remember Gina. Master William pushed me into the room and
removed the cuffs, my wrists red and a little bit sore.� �You have ten minutes.�� Although the water felt wonderful, I couldn�t
enjoy it as I thought of Gina.� �Five
minutes slave, you better be ready in time.� I quickly finished washing off the
soap and dried off, walking out just as he was about to come into the room.

&nbsp;

Breakfast was a quiet affair, with all of
the slaves looking at me and then at Gina. I tried to catch Gina�s eye but she
would not look at me and I noticed she wasn�t eating much.� I didn�t feel hungry either, the thought of
Gina being punished because of me making me feel sick. Master William pushed
his chair back and I was not the only one to jump, everyone seeming to be on
edge.� �Slave Gina, I want you in the
lounge room right now, Slave Jill, you stay with me. The rest of you need to
clean up and then join us.� 

&nbsp;

My mouth felt dry as I stood up. I saw Gina
give Master William a nervous look as she headed off to the lounge. I hoped he
would not be too hard on her and wished I had the nerve to ask him what he
intended doing. I started as he spoke to me, my attention on Gina. �Slave, in a
few moments you will see how what one person does can affect the whole
household. I hope this is the last time another slave will need to be punished
because of something you did.�� Tears
came to my eyes as I thought of what I had done. �Master, please don�t be too
hard on Gina, it wasn�t her fault.�� I
gasped as he pulled back my hair, the look in his eyes serious as he gripped my
chin in his hands.

&nbsp;

�Slave, how I treat my slaves is my
business. Don�t ever try to tell me what to do again.�� He let go and I stumbled back, shaken by the
tone of his voice.� �Come on, we don�t want
to keep Gina waiting too long.�� I
followed him into the lounge, eager to have the whole thing behind us.� Gina was kneeling down on the rug and looked
up nervously at Master William as he approached her, his hand gently running
over her hair.� �Stand slave.� Before we start I need you to understand why
I am doing this.� You were put in charge
of watching over our new slave and you failed in that task. This
punishment in to remind you to always be focused on what you have been asked to
do. Now, let�s get started.�� 

&nbsp;

Watching the two of them, I could see that
while Gina was scared, there was also a certain amount of determination to
please him.� I realised that their
relationship was so much more complicated than I had first thought.� It scared me to think of being that devoted
to someone who had so much power over you and vowed to never let myself get
that way.� Master William pulled out a
blindfold and tied it around Gina�s eyes just as the other slaves started to
come into the room. They congregated together on the other side of the room,
their concern for Gina showing in their faces.�


&nbsp;

�Good, we are all here.� Before we begin, I need to remind all of you
that Gina is being punished because she did not pay
the attention needed to watch over our new slave Jill.� However, I want to make it clear that Jill
has been punished and after we are done here, no more will be said about the
matter.� Like all new slaves, Jill made a
mistake and I want you to help to guide her in the right way to act.� �Yes
Master.� They had all spoken as one and again I could see the need to please
showing in their eyes.� It was too weird
the way they all looked at him like he was a god and I� found myself growing even more
determined not to let myself be like them. 

&nbsp;

�Gina has been blindfolded to remind her
that she was not looking when she should have been. The reason she was
distracted was because she was busy with the vacuum, so for the next fifteen
minutes, Gina will have another piece of machinery to be distracted by.�� We all gasped as the guy who had caught me
the day before carried in a machine with one of the biggest dildos I had ever
seen attached to it.� He placed it down
on the floor while Master William made Gina go down on her hands and knees and
then tied her arms and legs in place so that she could not move at all. While
Master William used his fingers and then some lube to make Gina�s pussy ready,
the other man plugged the device in and placed it on a low table,.� When Master
William stood up, the table was moved so that the dildo was sitting right at
the entrance to her pussy.� 

&nbsp;

I held my breath as the machine started up
slowly, Gina�s moans turning into screams of pain as the dildo slowly worked it�s way into her.� As
the machine began to pick up a bit of speed, she seemed to be able to cope with
it a bit better and I felt myself relaxing a bit.� Master William walked over to me and stood
behind me, his arms pulling me in tight.�
I wondered if he thought I was going to try to run again as he took my
hands and held them together in front of me with one his hands.� Gina�s moans were getting louder as the
machine picked up more pace and she shook in what
looked to be a massive orgasm. I looked at the clock on the wall and saw that
she still had over ten minutes to go.

&nbsp;

�Ok, everyone go and get on with your jobs.
Jill you will stay here and watch until Gina�s punishment is over.� He kept his
grip firm as Gina struggled as the machine started to go even faster, making
her grunt in time with each thrust.� I
couldn�t look anymore and turned my head away only to have it turned back
around. �Oh no, slave, you need to see every minute.� Being made to watch was
almost as hard as my punishment yesterday, the same feeling of being helpless
washing over me.� I knew I had to think
of some way to get out of the house, not willing to yet accept that this was
all my life would be. Gina was shaken again by another orgasm and I could see
the sweat covering her body as the machine continued to pound into her.� 

&nbsp;

Without thinking, I again tried to turn my
head away only to have my chin seized tightly. �What did I say, Slave, keep
your eyes on her or maybe you might find yourself in her place.� He held on for
another minute or so before moving his hand away and bringing it down between
my legs.� I spread my legs and let his
hand in, knowing that now was not the time to appear non-compliant.� On the mat, Gina was moaning louder again as
yet another orgasm hit her.� Looking at
the clock, I was relieved to see her time was almost up. 

&nbsp;

Master�s fingers were rubbing gently along
my slit, making me squirm in his arms. I could feel his cock digging into my
back as he pulled me against him and tried to block out the way he was making
me feel.� Gina screamed as the machine
sped up even more, her whole body shaking.�
Just as I thought she could not hold out much longer the machine began
to slow down and finally come to a stop.�
Master William let me go and went down to release Gina from her
restraints.� I stood and watched, hating
the fact that I was too scared to move.�
Master William gently helped Gina to her feet, removing the blindfold as
she cried softly.� �It�s
ok baby, your punishment is over. Jill, come here and help Gina to the bathroom
so she can have a bath. I am trusting that you will not try anything else to
get either of you into trouble.�� 

&nbsp;

I knew that now was not the time to try to
escape, not wanting to get Gina into any more trouble.� Taking her from Master William�s arms, I was
shocked to see a look of concern in his eyes.�
Leading her off to the bathroom, I again tried to work out the nature of
the relationship between Master and the other slaves.� Gina didn�t say a word as I filled the bath
with water, adding a good amount of bath oil so that the bubbles filled the
bath.� She let me help her in the bath
and lay with her head back for a few minutes before looking at me for the first
time all day. �Jill, I am sorry I treated you the way I did, I had forgotten
how terrified I was when I first came to be Master William�s slave.� I do understand why you did what you did, I
think once I would have done the same thing given the opportunity.�� 

&nbsp;

Feeling only relief that she was talking to
me again, I squatted down by the bath.�
�Jill, I didn�t even ask how you coped with your punishment, was it too
awful?�� I don�t know why but I just
couldn�t answer her and started to cry.�
She put her arm around my shoulder and let me cry. �Baby cry, we all
need to at times.� Once I had regained some control over my emotions, she got
out of the bath and started to dry off. �Sorry Gina, sometimes I just feel so
overwhelmed by everything. You know, like I am helpless.� Do you ever feel like that?�� She put the towel back on the rake and sat me
down beside her on the edge of the bath.�


&nbsp;

�Jill, you will feel that way for a while
longer yet, but one day you will start to want to please Master William, not
because you are scared of being punished but because you realise he is your
life.� I am not unhappy here, I don�t
even think I could survive in the world anymore, but I am aware of my
place.� There are still times, like this
morning, when I feel helpless, but usually I like the fact that I am an
important part of someone�s life. I know this properly makes no sense to you,
but I hope in time you will learn to be happy here too.� I was just about to
respond, when Master William appeared in the doorway.

&nbsp;

�Good to see you two talking again.� I had hoped you would be able to get over
what has happened.� Gina, go and help out
in the kitchen. Jill, come with me.� I wondered what he wanted from me now, my
emotions feeling raw after the last few days. He took me by the elbow, his
silence as we walked down the hallway to a room I had not seen before making me
nervous. Opening the door, I braced myself for what I might see.� What I did see took my breath away and I had
to look twice to make sure I was not seeing things.� In front of me was a room with a whole shelf
full of paints, brushes and other art supplies, all the things I thought I
would never get to use again.� Looking to
the other side of the room, I saw canvases and paper ready to use.� 

&nbsp;

�Slave, I told you that I reward my slaves
when they deserve it and I thought it might help you to see what your reward
would be.� I know that you were studying
art before you were captured, so I have collected a range of art supplies for your
use. Of course, you will have to have no more escape attempts and do what you
are told to get to use these. Well, what do you say?�� I was in shock and it took a moment to
realise he had stopped speaking. �Master, thank you.�
For the first time, I really felt like I meant it, the thought of being able to
do my art again making me feel hopeful. 

&nbsp;

�Just to let you know that this is
something you will get to do, I will give you thirty minutes now to show me how
good an artist you are. After that, this room will be out of bounds until I
decide you have shown me your willingness to submit.�� I hardly even heard what he was saying as I
itched to get my hands on the supplies. He must have noticed my eagerness, as
he laughed. �Go on, I can see you are already thinking of what you can do. I
will return soon.�� He left and I didn�t
even wait until he was out the door before I headed over to the shelf to see
what he had bought.� Dismissing the
paint, I picked up the pastels and a sketchbook and lost myself in my work.� I draw like a maniac, filling up one page
after another with images from the last few days.� I had always been able to sketch quickly and
by the time Master William had returned I had done over ten sketches.� I didn�t hear him open the door and only became
aware of his presence as he coughed.�
Jumping, I dropped the book on the floor and he picked it up, his face
showing some surprise as he looked at my work.

&nbsp;

�Jill, these are very good.� You have a real talent.� I felt some pride at
his praise and then another emotion began to take over, that of regret that
while I might be able to do my art again one day, I would never get to show my
art to the world.� �Slave, do you not
like my opinion of your work?� Thinking of what to tell him, I decided to just
tell him the truth. �Master, I am glad you like my work and that you will allow
me to practise my art again, but I am sad that I will never get to display my
art.� Please don�t think that I am
ungrateful for all this but I had always dreamed..�� I stopped, words failing me as my dream of
being a famous or at least well known artist, faded before my eyes.� 

&nbsp;

�Slave, I am sorry that your dream may not
get to be a reality but life does not always turn out the way we planned
it.�� I glared at him, my anger rising to
the surface as he dismissed my dreams like they were nothing.� Suddenly I remembered what he had said about
slaves going on trips to the city with him and a plan began to form.� I fought down my anger and dropped my eyes to
the ground.� �Master, sorry. �It has just been such an emotional time and I
am still trying to come to terms with all the changes in my life.� I will try to make you proud of me.�� I had to struggle to keep my voice sounding
contrite, wanting him to think I was willing to give up my dreams for him.� He seemed to believe me and gave me a hug
before letting me pack up the pastels and place them back on the shelf.� I found a surge of hope as I thought about my
plan, which I hoped would see me free one day.

&nbsp;

Chapter 6

&nbsp;

Over the next few months I worked hard to
be the best slave I could be, not hesitating to do what I was told no matter
how much I hated it.� Master William
began to treat me like one of the other slaves, only singling me out when he
wanted to use my body or to take me to the room to play with his bondage
gear.� I had been allowed to use the art
room a few times a week and this morning he had told me what I had been waiting
to hear since the day I had made up my mind to pretend to be the best slave
there was.

&nbsp;

He had called me into his office, opening
his legs to let me know I had to service him. I knelt down in front of him and
pulled down his zip.� I had learnt over
the months what he liked and despite still hating the way it made me feel, I
never let it show.� I licked his balls,
just the way he liked it, and then worked my tongue up the underside of his
cock before taking just the head into my mouth. He moaned as I ran my tongue
around the tip of his head, tickling the small hole and then moved my head
forward so that his cock sat deep in my throat. Master grabbed my hair but
still let me control my movements as I worked my head back and forwards on his
cock.� It had taken me a few months to
control my gagging and even now I still gagged at times, but mostly I could now
deep throat without stopping.� His grip
got tighter and he took control, holding his cock deep into my throat as he
came in me.� I felt my air lessen as he
held me still, finally pulling out as my head began to get a bit dizzy.� He gave me a moment to recover, his hand
rubbing my hair to tell me I had done a good job.� At first it had been hard to pretend that I
was starting to like his treatment of me, but I just tried to keep focused on
my goal of escape.� Now I knew he thought
I was becoming just like the other girls, a slave both in mind and body.� 

&nbsp;

�Slave, come and sit on my lap, I have some
news for you.�� My heart stopped, hoping
it was the news I has been waiting to hear but bracing myself for it to be
something else.� Settling myself on his
knees so that I was sitting astride him looking into his face, I made myself
smile as he played lightly with my nipples.�
�Slave, I have been very happy with your efforts to please me over the
last few months.� I told you when you
first came here that I like to reward my slaves sometimes with a trip away and
I think you have earned that trip.��
Inside I was jumping for joy but I just smiled at him, waiting for him
to tell me more. �This afternoon I need to go in to the city for the night so
that I can attend a meeting early tomorrow morning.� I thought you might like to go and visit the
art gallery. I have heard it is quite a good one.� This time I couldn�t keep my
excitement down and hugged him.� Luckily
he thought I was excited by the thought of going to a gallery, having no idea
this fit right into my escape plan. 

&nbsp;

�Of course, I expect perfect behaviour. No
one must know your status; on this trip you will be my girlfriend.� Plus you will have to be restrained while I
am at the meeting, but we will have a nice meal out and you will get to dress
up if you decide to go.�� I had no
thought of not going, thinking if my plan worked I would not be around in the
morning for him to restrain me.� I couldn�t
think of failing in my escape, as it would be the last time for a long time, if
ever, that I would have the chance again. He lifted me off his lap and pulled a
shopping bag from under the desk. �Here is an outfit you need to wear. Go and
have a shower and be ready in an hour to leave.� 

&nbsp;

�I
went to walk out, the bag in my hands when he stopped my by grapping my
hair.� �Slave, I hope that you appreciate
the chance I am taking.� I trust you
won�t let me down.�� I looked at him,
feeling a slight twinge of guilt at what I was planning to do.� �Master, I won�t let you down, I promise.�� He smiled, one of the smiles he uses when he
knows something you don�t. �That�s right slave, for if you let me down, you
will not only be punished but you will not get an opportunity like this again
for a long time.�� I nodded and he let
go, giving my bottom a slap as I went off to the bathroom.� 

&nbsp;

I could hardly contain my excitement as I showered, my head full of ways I might get out of his grasp.
I tried not to get too excited, knowing that the right opportunity might not
present itself this trip.� Getting
dressed after my shower felt very strange, as it was the first time in months
that I had worn clothes.� I looked in the
mirror, thinking how different I looked, the outfit sexy but not slutty.� I had not heard Master William and jumped as
he appeared in the doorway and gave a low whistle. �I know that I like to see
you naked but there is something to be said for a beautiful, sexy outfit. But
we have to go.�� I took a last look in
the mirror, feeling a rush of nervous excitement.� 

&nbsp;

The other slaves were working in the
kitchen and I only had the chance to say a quick goodbye, everyone assuming we
would be back tomorrow.� Master William
left Gina in charge, but with the two men who both worked around the house and
acted as guards, watching over the slaves as well. Driving along, I savoured
the surrounding countryside, not having seen outside of the grounds of the
house before. As the city approached, he pulled the car over into a picnic area
and turned to me. �Slave, we are almost at the motel and I just wanted to make
sure you know what to do.� You do not
speak unless you are spoken to and you in no way try to attract the attention
of anyone.� I will just register and then
we can head off to the art gallery.� I was so excited that I could hardly sit
still. �Now I know it has been a while since you have been out of the house,
but you will have to settle down. It would be a shame to have to give the
gallery a miss.�� 

&nbsp;

I made an effort to sit still, not wanting
him to change his mind about the gallery.�
By the time we pulled into the motel, I felt like I was about to burst.
As we walked into the motel, it seemed funny to see people going about their
lives, free to come and go as they pleased. Master William had his hand on my
elbow and I made sure I didn�t look at anyone as we headed to the reception
desk.� He was very polite as he got our
room key, even flirting a bit with the girl behind the desk.� If she only knew what he was really like, I
didn�t think she would be smiling at him the way she was. Once we had the room
keys, Master William led me back out to the car and we headed a few blocks away
to the gallery.

&nbsp;

�At
first I was lost in the art but then I remembered my plan and started to take
note of where the exits were.� It was
after we had been in the gallery for about thirty minutes and Master had
relaxed a bit, that I saw what I had been looking for. We were in a section of
the gallery with a number of sculptures standing on short pillars and a guard
watching over the room in the corner. I walked over to the first sculpture,
Master�s hand resting lightly on my elbow and just as I turned to go to the
next piece, used all my strength to push him into the sculpture.� In his surprise, he let go of me and tumbled
to the ground, the sculpture falling to the floor with a loud crash.� The guard came rushing over as he heard the
noise but I had already managed to make it to the entrance to the room.� 

&nbsp;

While everyone rushed in to see what all
the fuss was about, I walked out, not daring to look back in case I saw him
behind me.� My heart was beating so fast
and I felt sure I was going to feel Master William�s hand on me at any moment
but I somehow made it to the front door.�
I stepped out of the gallery and walked down the street, realising now
that I was free, I had nowhere to go and no money. I thought about going to the
police, but the thought of explaining to them what had happened just didn�t
seem like much fun. I was about five blocks away from the gallery when I
stopped, realising I still had his coat jacket over my shoulders. He had put it
on me when the gallery started to get cold; the looks of admiration in the eyes
of the surrounding women making him flash them one of his stunning smiles.� 

&nbsp;

I felt in the pockets and found some paper
and a pen, then just as I was about to think I wouldn�t find anything useful, I
pulled out a fifty-dollar note.� I knew
it wouldn�t get me far but at least it was something. The sound of a train
behind me gave me an idea and I ran in the direction of the noise, seeing a
station just down the end of the street. I was starting to panic, thinking
Master would had made it out of the gallery by now and could come around the
corner at any moment.� I ran into the
station and bought a ticket for the next train, which luckily had just pulled
up.� As I sat in the seat, the reality of
what I had done hit me and I started to shake.�
I had no idea where the train was going, but it was taking me further
away from him with every minute.� The man
across the way kept looking at me and I made an attempt to pull my skirt down
so I was not showing off so much of my legs, finally putting Master�s coat over
my knee.� By then the man had stood and I
prepared to run, before he simply walked to the door, getting off at the next
station.� My hands were shaking so badly
that I hid them under the coat, my mind trying to think of what to do.� 

&nbsp;

Finally the train reached its final stop, a
small town about thirty minutes out of the city. Having no choice but to get
off, I put the coat back on and headed down the platform, wondering where to go
now. I looked around me, seeing a few people heading to cars, but not knowing
which direction I should head in.� A
voice behind me made me jump and I turned to see a middle aged woman looking at
me with real concern on her face.

&nbsp;

�Honey, do you need some help? I don�t mean
to pry but not many people get off here and you look a bit lost.� My intention
was to say I was fine but her concern was enough to make be start to cry.
Before I knew it, she had bundled me into her car and taken me a few streets
away to her house. 

&nbsp;

A warm bath and a bowl of soup later, I was
sitting in a comfy lounge chair, while she sat and knitted in front of the
fireplace.� I sipped my tea, waiting for
her to ask me about myself, but she just kept on knitting. She had told me her
name was Helen as she had given me the soup, but had let me eat in silence.
Part of me still felt like I was in a dream, but I had really done it, escaped
from Master William. I shivered as I thought of how angry he must be and saw
her put down her knitting. �Dear, I had decided to wait for you to tell me what
is wrong but I just don�t think I can. I know you might not want to tell me
anything but at least let me know your name.��


&nbsp;

�Of course, I wasn�t thinking, my name is
J..Jenny.� For some reason, I didn�t want to tell her my real name. �I can�t
thank you enough for helping me.�� She
stood and came to sit on a seat closer to me, her face looking very motherly in
the firelight.� �Dear, I can tell you are
nervous and I couldn�t help but notice the marks on your body when you got into
the bath.� I don�t want to intrude but if
you want to talk to me you can.�� I
really wanted to tell her about Master William but it was still too soon. She
seemed to understand and patted my hand, making me jump.� �Let me show you where you can sleep and
tomorrow we will work out what you can do.�

&nbsp;

She led me upstairs to a small but cosy
room and I found myself asleep in no time.�
When I awoke to the sounds of birds outside the window, I jumped out of
the bed, not knowing where I was. Where was Master William?� He would be angry if I woke him up? Slowly
the events of the day before came back to me and I sat back down on the bed. My
heart was beating fast and I had to take a few deep breaths to calm down. The
knock at the door made me jump. �Jenny, are you up dear?� Can I come in?� It was so strange to have
someone ask to come in rather then just barging in. �Yes, come in.�� She poked her head around the door, a dress
in her hands. �This is a dress my daughter left here when she moved to the
city. I am sure she wouldn�t mind if you wore it.� I could only nod, her
kindness overwhelming me and she shut the door again. 

&nbsp;

I dressed and headed down stairs, the
smells coming from the kitchen reminding me how hungry I was.� Over a serve of bacon and eggs, I told Helen
a story about escaping from an abusive husband and my need to get far away.
�Dear, I thought it might be something like that. Now don�t you worry, as I am going
to pay for a bus ticket for you to go where you think you might be safe.� I
help up my hand to say it was too much. �When I was your age I had to do just
what you have done and since then I have tried to help out any other woman I
think might need it. If it makes you feel better, you can repay me one
day.�� I sighed and hugged her, feeling
like I could really get my life back. 


A week later I was sitting in my new apartment, Helen having also given me
enough money to last me for at least a few weeks. I had bought some paints and
canvases, painting some very commercial paintings. As I thought, these had sold
easily at the local caf� and they had asked me for more.� Over the next few months I started to
establish a name for myself, or at least my made up name, and gradually I began
to feel safe. I still woke in the middle of the night thinking I was back with
Master William and had to check all the doors and windows were locked before I
could go back to sleep. My paintings were selling well and I found myself
working all day to keep up with demand, which helped to keep my mind off what
had happened.

&nbsp;

One day I was approached to do a show in
one of the bigger galleries in town and from there I was asked to do more until
I was making quite a name for myself.� It
had been over a year since I had escaped and I could actually go a day without
thinking about Master William.� When I
was asked a few months later to go on a local talk show, I accepted, my new
name and new hair colour giving me the confidence that I would not be
recognised.� It felt so good to be talked
about as a rising talent and to have my art admired by so many people. My life
as a slave stated to fade even more from my thoughts as I made new friends and
attended fancy parties.� 

&nbsp;

I was on my way to another gallery opening
for an artist friend, having come home to change, when I noticed something on
the table that made my heart stop.� I
picked up the piece of rope, my hands shaking as I tried to think of a logical
reason why it could be there.� I had no
time to move as the hand came down to cover my mouth.� The voice in my ear was unmistakable. �Slave
Jill, you have caused me a lot of trouble.�
I hope you are ready to make it up to me.�� He spun me around and I was once again face
to face with the man I had hoped to never see again. I tried to read his eyes,
to see how angry he was, but he was not giving anything away.� 

&nbsp;

He manhandled me
over to my couch and pushed me down onto my knees.� I moaned as I hit the floor with a thud and
he tied my arms behind me with the piece of rope he had left on the table.� Coming around to sit on the couch in front of
me, his hand gripped my hair firmly enough for tears to come to my eyes. �I was in shock, not able to believe he had
found me again. �Slave you have a punishment coming, but we will get to that
soon.� He looked around the room, seeming to enjoy making me wait. �I see you
have done very well for yourself Jill or should I say Jenny?� My heart sank
knowing that he knew my new name.�
�Master, what �..� the rest of my question was cut off� by a slap across my face.� My cheek was burning, as was my scalp where
he had held on tight while he had hit me. 

&nbsp;

This time my
tears fell down my face as he shook my head. �Slave, don�t test my
patience!�� Just then the phone rang,
making us both jump. �Are you expecting a call?�� I nodded, thinking it was properly my friend
wondering where I was. �Ok, but you have to make it fast and you are not going
anywhere tonight or tomorrow for that matter.� He picked up the phone and held
it to my ear. �Julie, sorry I won�t be able to make it tonight. I just got a
call that an old friend has had an accident and will have to go away for a
while.� It was so hard to not ask her to help me, but I didn�t dare.� �OK, I�ll see you soon, good luck
tonight.�� 

&nbsp;

The phone was
removed from my ear and returned to its place. �Well done slave, I didn�t
realise you were such a good liar as well as an escape artist. Now, show me
where your bed is.�� My stomach flipped
as he pulled me up to my feet, my hair straining in his grip. I walked into my
room, standing just in the doorway.� A
push made me move forward and he knelt me down on the floor again.� He left me kneeling while he looked around
the room, whether to see if I would try to get away or just to keep me waiting,
I wasn�t sure.� I did think about running
but knew I wouldn�t make it too far and then would only make him have more
reason to punish me. 

&nbsp;

�Stand up and come here.�� I did as he asked and moved to stand
nervously in front of him. When his hand came to rest on my top button, I
expected him to start to take my shirt off but he surprised me by moving his
hand to gently grip my chin and kiss me.�
It was a slow, lingering kiss and it made want to kiss him back, though
I fought the urge. I wished he would get on with my punishment and not make me
wait.� As he broke off the kiss I was
surprised to see some sadness in his eyes.�
He seemed to hesitate for a moment, something I had never seen him do
and sat me down beside him on the bed.� 

&nbsp;

�Slave, I need to ask you something. Was
your escape a spur of the moment thing or had you planned it?�� He sounded so different from his usual
confident self that I found myself telling him the truth without any thought to
what harm it might cause me. �I had planned it master.� I shrank away from him,
expecting him to react badly to my confession, but he just sat looking at his
hands. �Was it that awful to be with me?��
His question took me completely by surprise and I took a moment to think
about how he had treated me. �Master, I just couldn�t stand the thought of
belonging to someone. I saw how the other slaves almost revered you and just
never wanted to be like that.�� 

&nbsp;

He stood up and walked a few paces to the
wall and then turned to face me again.� I
was unsettled by his behaviour and slight curious too.� �What I want to know is all those months,
were you just pretending to be happy as my slave?�� For some reason, I felt ashamed of my actions
and could only nod.� �What about the
other slaves, were you pretending to like them too?� One of the things I had
missed about my time with Master William had been the company of the other
slaves. �Oh no Master, I really did like them, I wasn�t faking that.�� �I am pleased to hear that but you haven�t
yet answered my original question. Was I that awful to be with?��� 

&nbsp;

Knowing there would be no getting out of
answering him, I took a breath before I tried to explain what I felt for him.
�Master, there were times when you scared and hurt me but�. but I have to be
honest and say that there were times when I did get enjoyment out of being with
you.�� I couldn�t believe I was telling
him these things.� He came and sat beside
me again, his hand coming to rest on my knee.�
Flinching, he gripped me tighter, no so it hurt but enough to make me
stay still.� �Ok, I can accept that.� I was just so surprised by your escape
because you seemed to be settling in so well.�
You are very lucky I didn�t catch you sooner as I was extremely angry
with you for a long time. It was just blind luck that I saw an advertisement
for one of your shows and though you look different, your art is the same. Now,
it is time to deal with your punishment.�

&nbsp;

The old Master was back as he stood me up
and pulled my shirt open, the buttons flying around the room.� Gasping, I went to move back only to have my
legs hit the bed, causing me to fall back onto my tied arms. Master laughed and
pulled off my skirt and panties, holding me down with his body.� He didn�t give me a break as he pushed his
fingers into me a few times before flipping me over.� This at least took the pressure off my arms
but now I found my self with my hands being pulled up by a rope so they pointed
up to the ceiling. He spread my legs wide and I felt them being tied off to the
sides of the bed.� It was funny but
despite my fear of what he was going to do, part of me was thinking how he must
have spent some time getting the ropes in place before I had come home.

&nbsp;

My head was pulled up and I felt a gag
being pushed in, one with a ball attached to a band of leather.� He tightened the straps and I felt the ball
push in further, the band around my face making it impossible to push the ball
out. I tried not to panic; hating the way the gag constricted my
breathing.� He lifted my face to the side
to check the gag, stroking my cheek with his fingers. �I know this is tight but
you do deserve it, also we don�t want any neighbours knocking on the
door.�� I closed my eyes and he put my
head down facing away from him. �Slave, you are not to move your head until I
say so.�� 

&nbsp;

I nodded and braced myself as I heard a
sound I knew well. The pain radiated through my left butt cheek, making me
scream behind the gag.� The right cheek
he hit just as hard and I understood why he had used such a restrictive gag.� He rubbed his hand over my bottom, before
hitting me again three times on each cheek, harder then he had the first time.
I flinched as his hand rubbed my bottom again. �That was just the warm up,
slave.�� I clenched the cheeks of my
bottom, but of course he simply waited until I had to relax them to strike
again. For the next few minutes he continued to hit each butt cheek in turn,
almost hitting me as hard as Master Tony had done so long ago. By the time I
heard something drop onto the floor, I was crying and my bottom felt like it
was on fire. 

&nbsp;

I hoped my punishment was over but knew
that was just wishful thinking.� He
rubbed my sore bottom making me try recoil away and then moved his hands down
to my pussy.� His fingers started in my
pussy but then moved up to my asshole.�
It was not the first time he had used my ass but it had been a while now
and I was not used to it.� Whimpering as
he pushed his finger in, I tried to move away from his probing digit.� �Stay still slave. This is a punishment you
have to take.� 

&nbsp;

His finger continued it�s probing, only being
removed to dip into my pussy to get more moisture. Eventually he got two
fingers in and then three, my asshole being made to stretch out wide.� I heard the sound of his zipper and then it
was his cock pressing against my hole and I was sure he was going to rip me
apart as he pushed into me.� It was the
first time he had not used any extra lubrication and I was in agony as he
forced his cock into me. I felt the head pop in and then a rush of flesh as his
cock wormed its way into me.� By this
time I was moaning constantly and tears covered my face. It made it hard to
breath and my head began to swim as his cock filled me completely, his balls
resting on my pussy.

&nbsp;

He stayed still for a moment, though it did
nothing to alleviate the pain.� I dreaded
him moving, knowing it would hurt like hell.�
When he did start to pull back, it was every bit a bad as I thought and
I screamed again behind the gag.� I felt
his fingers dip into my pussy again and when he pushed in, there seemed to be a
bit less friction. He must have put some of my cream on his cock and for that I
was extremely grateful.� Picking up
speed, he worked his cock in and out, the pain still bad but not so much as at
first. His fingers found my clit and began to rub it, his thrusts increasing
even more.� Despite the pain or maybe
because of it, I began to feel my orgasm approaching.� 

&nbsp;

His cock started to shudder in me and I
felt the first of his cum fill my ass as I began to cum under his clever
fingers. My body shook as he spurted more cum into me, his cock still filling
me until he was done.� When I recovered
from my own orgasm, I realised he had removed his cock but that I was still
restrained on the bed.� My shoulders were
starting to hurt and my ass both inside and out were on fire. I felt the gag
being undone and sighed as it came out, only to have him turn my head so that I
was facing him, or at least his cock.� 

&nbsp;

He pushed his cock against my lips and I
tried hard to ignore where it had been. Knowing what he wanted didn�t make it
any easier to do but I opened up and let him push his filth-covered cock into
me. I gagged at both the taste and the way he was pushing it into my
throat.� Figuring it was better to get it
over with, I used my tongue to lick the underside of his cock as he pulled out
again.� Then using my mouth, I closed
around the head, sucking and swallowing as much of the foul substance as I
could. He pushed back into my throat, remaining there until I thought I would
pass out. I tried to pull my head back but he had the back of my head in his
grasp. Pleading with my eyes, I gagged on his cock, spots appearing before my
eyes. Finally he pulled out, leaving me coughing and gasping on the
pillow.� 

&nbsp;

Once I had recovered and could breath
again, he picked up the gag and held my head to return it again. �Please
Master, I wont ..� He didn�t let me finish as he pushed the gag back in and
turned to leave.� I grunted at him,
shaking my arms and he turned back to me.�
Looking him in the eye I again shook my arms. �So you want me to let
your arms down? If I do, you owe me, ok?� I nodded my head and he let them down
so they were lying on my back.� He left
then and I heard the sound of the shower running and then he must have gone
into the kitchen.� Soon I could hear him
opening and closing cupboards and the sound of cooking. 

&nbsp;

As I lay there I wondered what would happen
now.� It was strange that he seemed in no
hurry to take me back to his house. Thinking about going back to life as a
slave made me feel helpless again and I struggled to get off the bed.� Just then the door opened and Master William
entered the room and sat down on the bed. Putting his hand gently onto my
bottom, the touch of his fingers made me jump, though the pain had eased
somewhat.� �I am going to let you up now,
so no nonsense ok?�� I nodded and he
released me from all of my bonds and then took off the gag.� He took my hand and led me into my own
kitchen, where I could see that he had some food ready for us.

&nbsp;

�I want us to be able to sit and eat, and
then we can talk about what will happen from here. Can I trust you to be
unrestrained?�� I had no desire to be
tied up and felt too tired to try anything. �Yes, I�ll be good.� I don�t want you to tie me up again.�� He smiled and rubbed my cheek, before sitting
me down at my own table. There was a cushion on the chair and it helped me to
be able to sit. I was surprised that while my bottom was tender it was not
aching like it had after Master Tony�s flogging.� It reminded me again of the difference
between the two men.� 

&nbsp;

We ate in silence, each of us seeming to be
occupied with our own thoughts. The food was good but I couldn�t eat much,
needing to know what he planned for me.�
�Not hungry?� Oh well, more for me
then.�� He took the rest of the steak off
my plate and I waited patiently while he finished eating.� I went to talk once but he held up his fork.
�No talking, just wait.�� 

&nbsp;

After he had finished, he made us both a
cup of coffee and we sat down in the lounge room. It would have seemed a normal
meal among two friends except for the fact that I was naked and he was
dressed.� I sipped my coffee and looked
at his man who again had control over me.�
Putting his cup down, he turned to me with a serious look on his face.
�We have a problem that I�m not sure what to do about.�� I played nervously with my coffee cup while
he continued to speak. �You have now become something of the minor celebrity,
so it makes it harder for you just to disappear again.� I had a flutter of hope
that he would leave me alone.� �However,
I�m not willing to let you go again.�� My
hope left me, making me feel that helpless feeling that I hated so much. I put
my head down and looked at my hands, only to find him leaning over to lift my
chin up again. �Hey, don�t worry, I think I have a solution that will suit both
of us.� 

&nbsp;

He let go of my chin and took another sip
of his coffee, making me wait yet again. �Please Master, I can�t stand not
knowing what you plan to do with me.� He put down his cup again and stared at
me, making me squirm in my seat. �Well slave, it really depends on you. As I
said, you are too well known to just take back and anyway, I have the feeling
you wouldn�t cope too well if I took you back to the house.�� I looked at him in surprise, not
understanding why he was being so thoughtful.�
�Don�t look so surprised slave, it is obvious to me that you are not cut
out to be a full time slave. That and the problem of you know being well known,
means that I have an interesting solution to offer to you.�� 

&nbsp;

Again he made me wait while he sipped his
coffee. ��Here is what I have in
mind.� You will stay here but be
available to me whenever I need you to be.� He sat back, obviously interested
in seeing my reaction.� �What do you
mean?� Are you saying that I can still
continue with my life but then I will have to still be your slave when you
say?� It sounded crazy but then it also meant I had a chance of living a near
normal life.� �Yes, that is right.� I suppose you are thinking that you could
just leave town when I go and never come back. Well I suppose you could but you
won�t. Do you want to know why?�� I
nodded. �Well, you told me yourself you cared for the other slaves, it would be
a shame if they had to be punished because of something you decided to do.� 

&nbsp;

I wanted to say, so what, but he knew that
I did care too much for them and worst still; I knew he would do it. Tears came
to my eyes, as I knew he had me trapped yet again. �How will I know when you
are coming, I mean, I need to travel with my art sometimes.� He smiled, as my
question told me I was going to follow his plan. �I will let you know in
advance when I am coming and we can keep in touch via email.� By the way, I was curious as to why you
didn�t just go straight to the police when you got away from me.�� 



�I just couldn�t stand the thought of telling
everyone what had happened to me. I just wanted to put it all behind me.�� He put down his cup and leaned in towards me
again, making me have to fight the urge to move away from him. �Well, I must
say I was expecting to have the police knocking on my motel room door, which is
why I moved motels that night.� You know,
I am not surprised very often but you really did surprise me. Now that I have
found you again, I have to admit I was kind of impressed.�� I felt a strange sense of satisfaction, in
spite of the fact that he had found me again. �Of course, I don�t expect
anything like that to happen this time.��


&nbsp;

I knew that I would not try anything, not
wanting to put the other slaves at risk.�
He pulled me up to my feet and steered me into my room again. He allowed
me some time to use the bathroom before telling me what he wanted me to do.
�Lie on the bed, on your back, hands above your head.� I followed his
instructions and he pulled out even more rope from under the bed and tied my
hands to the top of my bed.� Wondering if
he intended to use my body or just sleep, I felt relieved when he undressed and
then lay down beside me. He gently squeezed my breast as I felt his hot breath
in my ear. I moaned as he pulled my head up and again kissed me tenderly.� 

&nbsp;

�Slave, it is good to have you back.� With
that thought in my head, he turned off the lamp and in a few minutes was
asleep.� His hand was still resting on my
breast and as I had no way of moving it, just tried to ignore it. I fell asleep
with the sound of his breathing in my ear and his fingers on my breast. The
next morning I woke to the sensation of his cock in my pussy, his hand coming
down to cover my mouth as he picked up speed. �Morning slave, hope you slept
well.� I had no way of answering him as he pounded away, my grunts the only
sounds I could make. He didn�t take long to cum, pulling out and spurting all
over my breasts.� He still had his hand
over my mouth as he recovered his breathing, only removing it to stand up and
go into the bathroom. 

&nbsp;

He left me tied up and his cum hardening on
my breasts while he had his shower.� It
gave me time to think about how my life would be with Master William back in
it.� I knew I should be grateful that he
had not been angrier with me or that he was at least letting me continue with
my art, but still I felt miserable that my independence would be lost.� I had just started to feel a sense of freedom
both in my art and in my life.� I hadn�t
realised that I had started to cry until I felt the tears on my face. He walked
back into the room just as I was trying to wipe them away. �Hey, what is
wrong?� Are you in pain?�� Again I wondered at the complexity of the man
and how he really did seem to care about the well being of his slaves.� 

&nbsp;

�No Master, I was � I was just thinking
about how my life will change again.�� He
sat down and wiped away my tears, before untying my arms and letting me sit up.
�I know, slave, that you will find it hard at first to get used to being my
slave again. I still am not sure myself if this arrangement will work, but I
hope it can. If not, I will just have to take you back with me.� This was
something I didn�t want. �No master, please give me a chance. I promise I will
not try to get away and will do whatever you say.� I really did mean every word.� �Shh slave, I know you will, it might just
take some time for us both to get used to this new situation.� I have to go back this morning but will be
back tomorrow night. If all goes well, then we can continue. Now, I am ready
for some food.�

&nbsp;

That was how I came to be kneeling at my
door, handcuffs on, waiting for my Master to enter the room. It had been a few
months now and though there were times when I had thought of just disappearing,
I never had.� The other slaves had all
sent me emails and I had even spoken to Gina on the phone and I knew I could
never put them in danger.� It was a
strange life, but at least I was free most of the time.� The door opened and I saw the feet of my
Master enter the room.� �Afternoon slave.
Ready for some fun?�� I could only nod as
once again I became slave Jill, a slave in name and body, if not in mind.� That part of me I still managed to keep for
me.�
