A Story by Ninja5.

�Come on Jillian, kick it.&nbsp; KICK IT.�&nbsp; Joyce Smith a local real estate agent and team coach paced up and down the sideline.&nbsp; She screamed orders at the girl&#8217;s soccer team.&nbsp; Despite her desperation the team had fallen behind and wasn&#8217;t making good on any chance to equalize.

A small group of scattered mothers sat on the side lines and watched.&nbsp; As Grace sat watching her daughter run to intercept the other teams star striker she let out a cheer for her daughter.&nbsp; She didn&#8217;t notice Beth sit beside her.

�Hello stranger.&nbsp; How are we doing?�&nbsp; Beth nudged Grace in a friendly manner and was met with a welcoming smile from Grace.

�We&#8217;re behind 2-0.&nbsp; Joyce seems more worked up than usual.&nbsp; Must be stress from her job.�&nbsp; Grace said and winced as her daughter fumbled a tackle.

�Not stress from the job� Beth gossiped eagerly.&nbsp; �That guy she was dating, the one with the Mercedes, turns out he was married.�

�What!�&nbsp; Grace said turning from the game to stare at her friend.

�Tried to get her drunk and sign power of attorney of her body over to him.�&nbsp; The mischievous grin of Beth&#8217;s face broadened.

�He wanted her meat!�

�And not just for him.&nbsp; It was supposed to be a romantic surprise for his wife.�&nbsp; The grin was now a full blown smile of bitchiness.

Both Beth and Grace cracked up laughing.&nbsp; �And she was so proud of her new rich boy-toy.�&nbsp; Grace said before the laughter overcame them again.

�It&#8217;s always funny when it happens to someone else, isn&#8217;t it?� Beth said and rested her hand on Grace&#8217;s bare thigh.&nbsp; The affection between the two friends was not uncommon.&nbsp; They could trust each other in this girl eat girl world, and the pair looked out for each other&#8217;s daughters.&nbsp; �What&#8217;s happening with your sister?&nbsp; She still crashing on your sofa?�

�Oh God, don&#8217;t remind me.�&nbsp; Grace said her mood shifting.

�Sorry Grace.&nbsp; I didn&#8217;t mean to bring you down.� Beth said apologetically and squeezed Grace&#8217;s thigh.

�I felt sorry for her at first.&nbsp; When her partners business went bankrupt and she lost her to the bank, I thought to myself, she&#8217;s my sister I have to look out for her.�&nbsp; Grace paused with the memory.&nbsp; �But she&#8217;s made no effort to move out or look for work, and she&#8217;s such a bad influence on my daughter.&nbsp; The only clothes she has are lingerie so she always looks like a piece of meat.&nbsp; She just sits by the pool or on the couch all day and watches soap operas.�&nbsp; Grace paused.&nbsp; �You know last week she made my daughter watch an Oprah Special on the joys of becoming meat.�

�She what?�&nbsp; Beth blurted outraged.&nbsp; The pair both dreamed that their daughters would go on to college and have the happily married lives they&#8217;d both missed out on.

Beth&#8217;s husband had left her to do Gods work in the South Pacific.&nbsp; In reality he just wanted first pick of the native girls which was the region principle export.&nbsp; Grace&#8217;s husband had left her and her daughter when she refused to be dinner at their 10th wedding anniversary.&nbsp; Grace knew he just wanted a younger woman and had no intention of leaving her daughter unprotected with the new wife.

�I don&#8217;t care that she&#8217;s my sister.&nbsp; I just want her gone.�&nbsp; As Grace spoke softly, Beth leaned on her shoulder.

�Don&#8217;t worry, it&#8217;ll work out.&nbsp; We&#8217;ve both made it to our thirties.&nbsp; We&#8217;re survivors.�

The whistle blew for time.&nbsp; The game was over.&nbsp; Joyce Smith howled in frustration.&nbsp; The girls on Grace&#8217;s daughter&#8217;s team all walked in towards their irate coach.&nbsp; Joyce took a deep breath, �Alright girls.&nbsp; Run a lap.&nbsp; I need to speak to your parents.�&nbsp; The girls, already exhausted sighed and started off on a lap of the field.&nbsp; �Mothers to me.�&nbsp; Joyce said, waving her arms to the mothers to come in for a talk.&nbsp; Slowly the mothers of the girls got up and walked towards Joyce.

�What is it, oh leader on high?�&nbsp; Beth said mocking Joyce&#8217;s position.&nbsp; She didn&#8217;t like Joyce.&nbsp; Grace appreciated Joyce&#8217;s success in her job as a good role model for her daughter.

�I&#8217;m afraid I&#8217;ve put us in a bit of a situation.�&nbsp; Joyce looked around at the mothers.&nbsp; �I made a bet with the coach of the other team.&nbsp; Losing team must provide the meat for the winning team&#8217;s celebration.�&nbsp; Joyce dropped her eyes, unable to make contact.

There was stunned silence from the mothers and then Beth responded.&nbsp; �You did what?�

Joyce kept her head down.&nbsp; �I made the bet that one of the girl&#8217;s guardians would be the meat at the other team&#8217;s celebratory dinner.�

�Why in God&#8217;s name did you do that Joyce?�&nbsp; Beth asked, venom spitting from her tongue.

Joyce began to cry.&nbsp; �Because that bitch who&#8217;s married to my ex is a mother on the other team and I thought I could get back at him by eating her.�&nbsp; 

The anger against Joyce dissipated a little, but it was still fresh with Beth who never risked her meat.&nbsp; �So now, one of us has to march over there to be taken to the butchers?�&nbsp; Who?&nbsp; Which one of us is going to fill your obligation?�

As if to answer the question an African-American woman in her mid thirties was walking over to the group.&nbsp; She walked like a cat-walk model had a wry smile on her face.&nbsp; She approached within a meter of the group and then stood with her hands on her hips.&nbsp; �Ah, Joyce, this is your little rag-tag band of prospects.�&nbsp; The woman surveyed the group.&nbsp; �Anyone of them would do� Unless you&#8217;re prepared to take the responsibility yourself and join me and my husband for dinner.�

Horror and shame flushed over Joyce&#8217;s face and Grace correctly guessed this was the wife of the woman Joyce had been seeing.

�How can you enforce a bet on us we didn&#8217;t make?� Beth asked stepping between Joyce and the woman.

�Oh, it&#8217;s quiet legal.&nbsp; You signed away certain rights when your daughters joined the team.&nbsp; I should know; I&#8217;m a very successful attorney.�&nbsp; The woman ran her index finger down the side of Beth&#8217;s face.&nbsp; Beth sharply turned her head to avoid the contact.&nbsp; The nameless woman laughed.&nbsp; �Bring the candidate to this address next Saturday at 6:00pm.�&nbsp; The dark woman handed Beth a piece of paper.&nbsp; �If you don&#8217;t I commence an injunction to have each and every one of you held liable.&nbsp; You know what that means don&#8217;t you, we get all of you�&nbsp; The woman smiled a sexy smile.&nbsp; �Ciao.�&nbsp; She turned and started to walk away.

�Oh no� one of the mothers said.

�What will we do?� Another chirped.

Joyce was useless, crying off to the side.

�Hold on ladies.&nbsp; We have a week to think of something.�&nbsp; Beth said taking charge of the group.

�And if we don&#8217;t think of anything?� Grace added, not meaning to distract from Beth&#8217;s message of hope.

�Then we&#8217;ll draw straws.&nbsp; And everyone will have to draw.�&nbsp; Beth glared at Joyce as she spoke.

The mothers all concealed there fear as their daughters returned from their lap of the field.

Chapter 2.

�Mum, are you Ok?�&nbsp; Jillian asked her mother Grace.

�What?� Grace was in a daze on the drive home, lost in her troubles.

�You&#8217;ve looked really freaked out ever since the soccer game.&nbsp; What&#8217;s up?�&nbsp; Jillian was pretty like her mother.&nbsp; Her long dark hair came down to her shoulders, but was tied back for soccer.&nbsp; The muddy uniform clung to her delicate frame.

�It&#8217;s nothing sweetie.&nbsp; What did you want to talk about?� Grace replied concealing the danger she was in from her daughter.

�Well graduation from high school is coming up and I&#8217;ve been giving it some thought.�&nbsp; Jillian said calmly, but there was excitement behind her voice.

�And you want to talk about college?� Grace said proudly.

�No, I was thinking about not graduating.&nbsp; You know, volunteering for the graduation feast.�

Pale terror covered Grace&#8217;s face like a vale.&nbsp; She was stunned into silence.

�I&#8217;m eighteen, but because I haven&#8217;t graduated from high school I still need a parent or guardian to sign the consent form for me.�&nbsp; Jillian continue as if her mother wasn&#8217;t close to dying from shock.&nbsp; �I was talking to Aunty Kelly and she said she always regretted not volunteering.&nbsp; So I figured why risk living with regret, why not volunteer.&nbsp; And the bonus is you get back all my tuition fees.�

�Your Aunt put these ideas into your head?�&nbsp; Grace asked softly, hurt beyond measure.

�No one put the idea in my head, it&#8217;s just we&#8217;ve talked about it a lot and I think it&#8217;s something I want to do.�&nbsp; Jillian paused and stared at her mother expecting a response.

�Sweetie there&#8217;s no going back from something like that.&nbsp; It&#8217;s not the future I had planned for you.�&nbsp; There was a soft pleading in Grace&#8217;s voice.

Being a teenager Jillian was oblivious to it.&nbsp; �Well I&#8217;ve already worked it out with Aunt Kelly.&nbsp; If you don&#8217;t sign the consent form she will.&nbsp; She is my God-mother after all and that makes her a legal guardian.�

An idea so perfect popped into Grace&#8217;s head.&nbsp; Hastily she pulled out her phone and dialed Beth.&nbsp; The phone rang a couple of times and Beth answered.&nbsp; �Beth, I think I&#8217;ve just come up with a solution to our little problem.�

Chapter 3.

When they arrived home Grace followed her daughter through the front door.&nbsp; As they entered the living room Kelly lay sprawled on the couch in Black lingerie, a remnant from when she was a kept woman.&nbsp; Mournful groans came from the television.&nbsp; Kelly was watching a cooking show on how to pull off a live spit roast.&nbsp; Grace was horrified as Jillian watched eagerly.

Kelly truned her head to her niece.&nbsp; �Erotic isn&#8217;t it.�

Jillian bashfully sighed.

Kelly winked at her and Jillian ran upstairs to her room excitedly.&nbsp; 

Grace waited to hear her close her bedroom door.&nbsp; �You know I just had an interesting talk with my daughter.�

Kelly perched up in her lingerie.&nbsp; She had no intention of going out, but wore full makeup.

�Oh, what about?�&nbsp; Kelly said, playing dumb.

�It turns out she doesn&#8217;t want to go to college anymore.&nbsp; She wants to be roasted at her high school graduation.�&nbsp; Grace stood confrontationally in front of Kelly.&nbsp; Though furious at her sister she had to play it out calmly if things were to work out.

�I wonder where she got that idea from.�&nbsp; Kelly had the boldness to make eye contact.&nbsp; She had no shame.&nbsp; �But you know; getting her tuition back would help both of us out.&nbsp; We are short of money.�

�I suppose your right.�&nbsp; Grace lied.

�I&#8217;m what?&nbsp; Wait, you&#8217;re ok with this?�&nbsp; Kelly&#8217;s expression turned to shock and she stared bewildered at her older sister.

�Yes, what my little girl wants, my little girl gets.�&nbsp; It took every ounce of Grace&#8217;s restraint to smile at her sister as she said it.

�Gosh Grace, I thought you&#8217;d be angry.�

�Angry, why would I be angry?&nbsp; It&#8217;s not like you had anything to do with it.&nbsp; There is one small thing.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t think I can bring myself to sign the consent form.&nbsp; As her guardian would you do it?&nbsp; I&#8217;d give you a percentage of the returned tuition fees.�

Kelly stuttered in response.&nbsp; �Yes, I mean I&#8217;ll miss my niece, but it&#8217;s like you said; she should have what she wants.�

�Excellent� Grace concluded.&nbsp; �We&#8217;re meeting an attorney at a pool party next week to sign the papers.&nbsp; Saturday, 6:00pm.&nbsp; Wear something sexy, I hear they&#8217;ll be lots of hot to trot soccer mums there.�&nbsp; Grace walked from the room, her business concluded for now.

Kelly called out after her.&nbsp; �Thanks sis&#8217;, I can always rely on you.�

Chapter 4.

Unbeknownst to Kelly, Beth sat in the passenger seat for moral support.&nbsp; Grace drove with her nerves on edge.

�Relax sis&#8217;, remember this is what Jillian wants.�&nbsp; Kelly said, still completely in the dark over Grace&#8217;s plan.

�Yes� Grace replied.&nbsp; �This is what best for her.�

They pulled up at the stately home, and it was immediately obvious a party was in full swing.&nbsp; �Wow, your sure letting your little girl go with a bang.�&nbsp; Kelly said getting out of the car.&nbsp; As Grace had suggested she had worn something sexy and suitable for a pool.&nbsp; Kelly wore a checkered blue and white bikini.&nbsp; Like always she looked like a piece of meat.

Grace wore a snug little red bikini, not wanting to make her sister suspicious.&nbsp; Beth had refused to come to a meat-girl party dressed as something edible.&nbsp; She wore a white singlet and blue jeans.&nbsp; All three approached the front door, but before Grace could ring the bell it opened.

�The guest of honor is finally here.�&nbsp; The African America woman stood before them in a white bikini.&nbsp; Her legs, tummy and breast were perfect.&nbsp; She had an air of total control over the situation.&nbsp; It unnerved Grace and Beth, but Kelly seemed ignorantly turned on by it.

�Hi, I&#8217;m Kelly.�&nbsp; Kelly said pushing past her sister.&nbsp; �And you are?�

�Married.�&nbsp; The woman replied sensing Kelly&#8217;s attraction.&nbsp; �But always looking for new toys to play with.&nbsp; You must be Jillian&#8217;s guardian.&nbsp; You&#8217;re even more beautiful than I&#8217;d hoped.�

�Thank you� Kelly said, and pretended to be embarrassed.

�I&#8217;m serious�, the woman said.&nbsp; �You look scrumptious.�&nbsp; The woman stepped back allowing the trio to enter.&nbsp; Grace received a hungry look from the black woman; Beth a look of disapproval.

The home was immaculately decorated.&nbsp; Kelly walked through admiringly, running her hands over an antique cabinet.&nbsp; Another woman appeared in a blue bikini.&nbsp; She was in her late thirties but had a soft toned figure.&nbsp; She gazed at Kelly.

�You must be Kelly.�&nbsp; She said eyeing her figure.

�Yes, and you are?�&nbsp; Kelly replied.

�I&#8217;m Cherry.&nbsp; Come on I want you to meet the girls.�&nbsp; Cherry grabbed Kelly by the hand and whisked her towards the kitchen.&nbsp; 

Once she was gone the dark woman turned to Grace and Beth.&nbsp; �She doesn&#8217;t know does she?�

�No.&nbsp; No I haven&#8217;t told her yet.�&nbsp; Grace replied.&nbsp; Fearful of the woman&#8217;s reaction.

�Well I guess we better get the paper work signed before she makes a break for it and we have to settle for one of you.�&nbsp; She ran a finger over Graces exposed belly.&nbsp; �Although either of you would be more than satisfactory.�

Grace was unsettled with the touch.&nbsp; Beth immediately came to her defense.&nbsp; �The papers� Beth said.

�Of course� the woman said.&nbsp; �Cherry, bring our new friend into my study.&nbsp; We need her to sign the papers.&nbsp; The black woman turned and started walking to an adjoining room.&nbsp; Grace and Beth followed.&nbsp; Once inside, Kelly led by Cherry, quickly followed.&nbsp; �Here are the documents my dear.&nbsp; Please sign.�

Kelly gave no sign of suspicion and signed the paper were the proud woman had signified with an X.&nbsp; As her sister put down the pen Grace gave a sigh of relief.&nbsp; Kelly paused over the document, but before she could even read the heading Cherry grabbed her arm and began gently guiding her back out to the party.

Grace, Beth and the woman were alone in the study.&nbsp; The African American woman stared at Grace.&nbsp; �Don&#8217;t worry, there&#8217;s no trickery afoot.&nbsp; Just your standard power of attorney, with a clause waving her rights for humane treatment.�&nbsp; The woman filed the document in her draw and smiled at the two.&nbsp; �I insist you stay for dinner.�

Grace was horror filled at the suggestion.&nbsp; Beth spoke up for her.&nbsp; �Our business is done; I think we&#8217;ll be leaving.�

�Oh no� the woman said.&nbsp; �I&#8217;ve been looking into your finances.&nbsp; Single mothers, doing it hard.&nbsp; You particularly Beth.&nbsp; Grace gets child support from her husband, but you get nothing.&nbsp; It would be a shame if someone approached the bank and offered to buy out your debt, say, in exchange for the rights to someone&#8217;s meat.�

�You bitch!� Beth blurted.

�Oh please.&nbsp; I won&#8217;t give you any trouble.&nbsp; Just stay for dinner.&nbsp; I insist.�

Beth looked at Grace.&nbsp; �We&#8217;ll stay� Grace said, supporting her dearest friend.

�Excellent.&nbsp; I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ll appreciate how us successful women party.

Grace and Beth followed the woman into the kitchen.&nbsp; Kelly stood, the centre of attention leaning against the kitchen bench.

Kelly took a break from bathing in the attention to smile at her sister.&nbsp; Grace smiled back, unsure of what was about to happen.&nbsp; Kelly leaned back on the counter and twirled her hair in a sexy pose enjoying the attention from every pair of hungry eyes.

�I&#8217;m a little peckish� Kelly said.

�Me two� said Cherry barely able to contain her excitement.

�What are we having?�&nbsp; She asked the dark woman, correctly figuring her as the woman in charge.

�Why Kelly!&nbsp; We&#8217;re having you.�&nbsp; A wry smile grew on the woman&#8217;s face, and the hidden hunger of all the soccer mums was finally revealed.&nbsp; Kelly was surrounded in hungry smiles.&nbsp; Their teeth glistening with drool.

Sudden realization came over Kelly.&nbsp; Despite a perfect understanding of the situation she had to ask �What?�

�That consent form you signed, it wasn&#8217;t for your niece.�

Kelly turned a panicked gaze at her sister.&nbsp; Grace was too ashamed to make eye contact.&nbsp; Kelly, no longer stunned, tried to make a bolt for the kitchen door.&nbsp; Cherry was ready and plunged a taser into her back, gleefully pulling the trigger.&nbsp; Kelly dropped to the tiled floor hard and the soccer mums laughed in unison.

A single tear flowed from Graces eye.&nbsp; Beth put her arm around her in support.

Chapter 5.

Grace and Beth stood awkwardly in the corner as Kelly regained consciousness.&nbsp; She stood leaning over a hotplate out by the pool.&nbsp; She tried to stand straight put was lashed to the hotplate.&nbsp; Her bikini top had been removed, offering her breast no protection from the grating of the grill. 

�What&#8217;s happening?�&nbsp; She asked in a pained and dazed voice.&nbsp; Again she tried to straighten herself.

�Don&#8217;t panic� Cherry said, basting her breasts in melted butter of to the side.&nbsp; �We&#8217;re going to play a little game.�

�What game?&nbsp; What&#8217;s going ��?�&nbsp; Her memory came back to her.&nbsp; �Oh no!�

�Oh yes� Cherry replied.&nbsp; �Here&#8217;s how the game works.&nbsp; I&#8217;m going to pull down your bikini bottoms and start teasing you with a vibrator.&nbsp; When you come, we turn of the grill and roast up these delicious titties of yours.&nbsp; If you want to save your titties, you&#8217;re going to have to resist, but I warn you, I very good.�

Kelly tugged desperately against her restraints, but to no avail.&nbsp; The soccer mums let out giggles of joy.&nbsp; �Please don&#8217;t do this.�&nbsp; Kelly begged.&nbsp; �I&#8217;ll do anything.�

�Anything?!�&nbsp; Cherry asked and looked to the dark woman for her response.&nbsp; The dark woman shook her head and signaled the go ahead with a thumbs down.&nbsp; Cherry slowly started lower Kelly&#8217;s bikini bottoms revealing a moist shaved pussy.&nbsp; �Oooh, it&#8217;s seems you&#8217;re a little excited by your predicament.�&nbsp; Cherry said to choruses of approvals from the mums.&nbsp; Cherry ran her finger over the lips of Kelly&#8217;s vagina.

Grace and Beth watched in horror as the dark woman began stroking her privates.

�No really, I&#8217;ll do anything you want.&nbsp; Grace.&nbsp; Grace help me.�&nbsp; Kelly pleaded and Grace closed her eyes unable to stand her sisters desperation.&nbsp; �I don&#8217;t want to be eat��..�&nbsp;&nbsp; Kelly&#8217;s pleas broke off with an intrusive groan.&nbsp; Cherry had started working with the buzzing vibrator in and out of Kelly&#8217;s vagina.&nbsp; Unwelcome moans and sighs from the intrusion led the soccer mums to silence and they all eagerly watched the show.&nbsp; 

After what seemed like an eternity of mournful pleasure from Kelly, she finally let out a grunt.&nbsp; Her stomach muscles contract rhythmically for a few seconds and she cried out �No. No� again.&nbsp; Her mission accomplished Cherry depressed the igniter and grill flared, the flames washing over Kelly&#8217;s delightful breasts.&nbsp; As Kelly screamed the soccer mums applauded Cherry who turned smiling and took a bow.

The dark woman turned to the horror filled Grace and Beth and said �Dinner will be about fifteen minutes.&nbsp; I hope you like Sloppy Joes.�&nbsp; She smiled like a woman in harmony with the universe and walked over to the twitching Kelly.&nbsp; She ran her hands over Kelly&#8217;s smooth buttocks and whistled at Cherry who turned dutifully.&nbsp; �I think we could do with some bacon on our hamburgers� she said and slapped Kelly&#8217;s cheek.&nbsp; Kelly was too absorbed in the burning pain of her breast to notice, but she did react as Cherry began slicing thin strips of flesh from the crest of her buttocks to her back thigh.&nbsp; The strips of meat were placed on the hot plate and began to sizzle.

�There horrible� Grace chanced, whispering quietly to Beth.

�They&#8217;re not even going to give her pain killers.� Beth added and tried to move between Grace and the spectacle of her cooking sister.&nbsp; She could not shield her from the delicious aroma that wafted over the courtyard.

Kelly&#8217;s ordeal drifted to the background as the soccer mums returned to talking amongst themselves.&nbsp; A short haired woman in a one piece swimsuit approached Grace and Beth with garlic bread.&nbsp; She was welcoming in contrast to their treatment of the meat.&nbsp; Cherry was still attending the grill however, piercing Kelly&#8217;s breast with a fork to allow the juices to escape.

When Kelly&#8217;s breasts were cooked through Cherry and the short haired woman unlashed Kelly from the grill.&nbsp; Kelly&#8217;s legs gave way under her, the ordeal too much for her body.&nbsp; The two women dragged her by the shoulders to a table.&nbsp; Whilst the short haired woman held Kelly&#8217;s head back, Cherry began slicing Kelly&#8217;s breast on a cutting board.&nbsp; Each slice was collected with a set of tongs and places in a burger bun along with Kelly&#8217;s bacon.


The women queued up to get one, Beth and Grace holding back to the end of the line.&nbsp; When it was finally there turn Cherry greeted them with a smile.&nbsp; �I saved the two juiciest ones for you two.�&nbsp; She held out a tray with two burgers.&nbsp; �Now I&#8217;d love to stay and chat, but I&#8217;ve got to drag your sister over to the coal pit.&nbsp; We&#8217;re roasting her legs next.�

Kelly&#8217;s eyes were half closed, her body twitched from the trauma.&nbsp; As Cherry dragged her away Grace and Beth were left staring at the Hamburgers.&nbsp; The dark woman approached them, Hamburger in hand, it was half eaten.

�It would make me feel better as hostess if you ate.�&nbsp; She said eyeing them cautiously.

Reluctantly the pair drew the hamburgers to their mouths and each took a bight.&nbsp; Grace gave no reaction.&nbsp; Beth took another bight as if she couldn&#8217;t help herlsef.

�Oh come on now.&nbsp; You&#8217;ve got to admit your sister is one tasty hunk of meat.�&nbsp; The woman paused for a response, any response.

Over the other side of the garden Kelly started softly screaming as Cherry drew her legs over the coal pit.&nbsp; The dark woman turned to Grace and Beth, taking her attention away from Kelly&#8217;s pleas for mercy.&nbsp; �I think you two have seen enough.&nbsp; I thought this might be liberating for you Grace.&nbsp; I had no idea you and your sister were so close.�

�We used to be.�&nbsp; Grace replied.&nbsp; �When we were young.�

�I see.�&nbsp; The woman stood and guided Grace and Beth down the hallway to the front door.&nbsp; As she opened it she turned to address them.&nbsp; �I&#8217;ve been giving your financial situation a bit of though Beth.&nbsp; Do you know you could sell your house and move in with Grace you would be debt free.�&nbsp; She smiled at Beth softly.&nbsp; �You two obviously love each other and your daughters are practically best friend.&nbsp; It would solve every ones problems.�

It took this strange woman to say what the pair had been thinking of for years through all their hardships.

�I would be happy to take care of all the legal paper work pro-bono.&nbsp; After tasting your sister, I feel we&#8217;ve become friends.�

�Thank you� said Beth.&nbsp; She was taken off guard by the sincerity of the woman.

�Hey, it would be nothing.�&nbsp; The woman said smiling warmly.&nbsp; �I only a bitch when I&#8217;m hungry.�&nbsp; She moved from the doorway and allowed the pair to leave.

As Grace and Beth walked hand in hand to Grace&#8217;s car, Beth turned and said �Would that be Ok, me moving in with you.

�Of course, the girls will be going to college next year, I&#8217;d be happy with the company.&nbsp; Just make sure you carefully read any documents she prepares for you.�
