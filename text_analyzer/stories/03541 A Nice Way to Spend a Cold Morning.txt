Synopsis: Gabrielle's back and her friend is about to find out what she's been into.A Nice Way To Spend A Cold Morning. 
-- G Man 
They ran into each other at the front door. He was just on his way out and
  Cheyenne was on her way in. 
�Greetings,� he said with a smile, pulling his coat on. He stopped long enough
  to give Cheyenne a friendly kiss. 
�Gabrielle up yet?� Cheyenne asked. 
�She's still in bed.� 
�She remembers what we were supposed to do today, doesn't she?� 
� I think so, but she wouldn't get up.� He fished his car keys out of his
  coat pocket and headed out the door as Cheyenne went inside. �Maybe you'll
  have better luck with her. I gotta go. There's coffee in the kitchen. It's
  fresh. You two have fun.� Cheyenne watched him walk out to his car, his breath
  visible in the autumn morning air. She closed the door and hung her leather
  coat in the hall closet. 
Cheyenne was a tall, willowy woman with a lithe body and long blond hair.
  A pair of tight blue jeans hugged her hips and her narrow waist. Her breasts
  pushed out her top, accentuated by the shirt being tucked in the jeans, drawing
  the material tight over her front. 
As she was closing the door to the closet, she noticed a pair of plastic garment
  bags like those you would get from the dry-cleaners hanging to one side. The
  tag from the cleaners was still pinned to the hangar. On it was written �Clean
  and prep � two leather �garments'�. �Garments� was a weird way to refer to
  it. Usually they would just write �coat� or �jacket� or whatever. Cheyenne
  closed the door and went deeper into the house. The air seemed a little on
  the cool side, as if the heat had been turned down. Not freezing cold, but
  certainly chilly enough to keep you in bed under the covers. 
�Gabrielle?� There was no answer. Cheyenne headed toward the bedroom. �Gabrielle?� 
The door to the bedroom was cracked slightly and Cheyenne peeked in to see
  a figure underneath the snow-white down comforter, covered completely. Gabrielle's
  strawberry blond hair poked out over the top on a hill of pillows. �Gabrielle?� There
  was a whimper from the bed and a slight shifting under the sheets. Cheyenne
  poked her head through the door. �You gonna get up?� There was another mute
  protest, a little more adamant this time. �Whatever.� Cheyenne went back out
  and headed toward the kitchen. That coffee he mentioned sounded good and she
  would probably need to get Gabrielle started anyway. The house sure did seem
  chilly. Cheyenne looked at the thermostat on the way and noticed that it read
  67 degrees. She thought about turning it up, but she was only a guest here
  and the control panel on it looked daunting enough for a MIT grad. 
Cheyenne fixed two cups of coffee and started to walk back toward the bedroom.
  The chill of the house was starting to cause her to get goosebumps. She thought
  of that bed that her friend was now in. 
The bed was king sized and just the right mix of firm and soft. It had the
  fluffiest comforter that she had ever seen and on occasion in the winter, it
  had a wonderful fitted sheet made out of sheepskin. The pillows were all goose
  down, including the �body� pillows. It was soft, warm, and cozy. Cheyenne had
  spent a night or two in that bed with the current occupant and remembered how
  luxurious it was. She couldn't blame Gabrielle, especially with the house so
  cool. Maybe Gabrielle had the right idea. 
�Got you some coffee,� Cheyenne said, re-entering the bedroom and coming over
  to the bed. Gabrielle sank down deeper into the covers. 
�No, thanks.� The folds of down muted her reply. Cheyenne looked at the mound
  of womanly curves as she stood at the side of the bed. Gabrielle was on the
  far side, facing away from her. All that she could see was the hair. Fuck it. 
Cheyenne put down the coffee on the vanity and took off her clothes. Gabrielle
  felt her sliding in with her, a smile on her face. 
�Gabrielle�� Cheyenne said seductively as she reached for her lover. �Gabrielle�wha�what
  the fuck?� Cheyenne 's hands had expected to touch Gabrielle's soft skin and
  instead seemed to be touching a strange mix of leather and cold steel. With
  some effort, Gabrielle rolled over and met Cheyenne face to face. Gabrielle
  pushed her body against Cheyenne . Cheyenne probed under the covers, perplexed
  by what she was discovering. 
�I may not be able to join you today,� Gabrielle said apologetically. Cheyenne
  propped herself up on her right arm and flung the covers down with her left.
  She let out a small gasp. Gabrielle's splendid body was encased in a super
  skintight wrap of black leather. From the neck down, not a sliver of skin was
  visible, held prisoner in a diabolical combination of what seemed to be a straight
  jacket and tight leg sheath. Gabrielle smiled and blushed as Cheyenne moved
  back to take it all in. 
Gabrielle's arms were wrapped around her in long, finger-less sleeves that
  disappeared behind her, framing her bulging breasts and held in place by tight
  straps on both upper arms and one strap in front across her middle. The straps
  appeared to be of a cut length with no room for adjustment. A silver two-piece
  buckle that had a keyhole in its center joined each strap. Obviously a key
  would be required to undo them. Cheyenne 's eyes wandered down the black form,
  noticing how Gabrielle's legs had been forced together into a single column
  of black leather, bound tightly. The jacket was tucked into the leg sheath
  and the two were joined by smaller versions of the buckle-locks that bound
  her arms. With a slight hesitation, Cheyenne reached her hand out and felt
  Gabrielle's arm. The leather was as tight as a drum against the skin. Her hand
  moved down and felt Gabrielle's breast, feeling the firm nipple and piercing.
  The exploration continued down, squeezing Gabrielle's tightly wrapped ass and
  tracing down her legs. Cheyenne pulled the covers all the way off to reveal
  the single high heel boot that imprisoned both feet and had yet another buckle-lock
  to prevent removal. Cheyenne rolled Gabrielle onto her stomach and examined
  the back. The sheath and the straight jacket had large silver zippers up their
  center and buckle-locks to prevent any effort to remove the suit. Cheyenne
  's initial shock was slowly turning into lust as she continued to feel Gabrielle
  up through her leather bondage. Gabrielle moaned and sighed quietly as she
  could just feel Cheyenne 's hand through the tight material. 
�Have you been in this all night?� Cheyenne asked, rolling Gabrielle onto
  her back. 
�No. He put me in it before you got here. I wanted to surprise you.� 
�How long does this thing take to get on?� 
�About half an hour or so.� Cheyenne had lain back down alongside the left
  side of Gabrielle's mummified body, pushing herself closer and feeling the
  tight leather against her own skin. Cheyenne propped her head on her hand and
  used the other to caress Gabrielle, paying wonderful attention to her breasts.
  Gabrielle felt Cheyenne hook her left leg over her bound thighs and slowly
  push her groin against her leather. Cheyenne ran her fingers gently down the
  side of Gabrielle's face; Gabrielle's eyes closed in the delight of it all. 
�I have never seen you look so beautiful,� Cheyenne said softly into her ear.
  Gabrielle was slipping into her own world of the leather's tight embrace and
  Cheyenne 's wonderful touch. She felt Cheyenne kiss her on the neck, just above
  the jacket's collar. Gabrielle turned her face slightly and then felt Cheyenne
  's tongue slowly trace around her lips. Gabrielle parted her lips and a slight
  moan escaped before she was gagged with Cheyenne 's tongue. Cheyenne wrapped
  her arms around Gabrielle and held her tight, her sex steaming against the
  outside of the leather suit. Gabrielle tried to resist but gave into Cheyenne
  's amazing tongue and let her continue. 
By now, Cheyenne had spread her long legs over and straddled Gabrielle near
  the waist so that their pussies were more or less aligned. Cheyenne ground
  herself into the leather sheath and Gabrielle could just feel it against her,
  the pressure pushing against the sinister crotch strap that was locked onto
  the bottom of the jacket so tight that it had to be tugged shut. Cheyenne 's
  breasts flattened against Gabrielle's, the sensation Gabrielle felt through
  the thin leather was fantastic. Cheyenne slowly sat up, drawing her long brown
  mane over Gabrielle's face. The tickle of each hair was exquisite, as was the
  sound of the hair running over the leather jacket. Whether or not she could
  feel it, Gabrielle reacted as if she felt the hair through the leather enclosing
  her chest. Gabrielle saw Cheyenne 's proud breasts above her and wanted to
  reach out and fondle them, but her arms refused to budge. Gabrielle began to
  squirm, setting Cheyenne off on a wild ride, causing Cheyenne to push her sex
  into the leather even more. Gabrielle dug in and lifted her hips against Cheyenne
  's as Cheyenne 's crunched down on hers. Cheyenne 's passion mingled with the
  scent of the leather, causing Gabrielle to drip between her welded thighs.
  Cheyenne dropped down and wrapped her arms around Gabrielle, pulling her tighter
  toward her. 
�I want you so bad,� Cheyenne hissed into Gabrielle's ear. �I want you so.� Gabrielle
  felt a tongue against her earlobe. �Where's the key?� Cheyenne was practically
  sawing Gabrielle in half with her hip motions. 
�He has it,� Gabrielle whispered. Cheyenne stopped for a moment. 
�What?� 
�He has it,� Gabrielle repeated, lost in her world of leather and sex. �Don't
  stop.� Gabrielle continued thrusting her hips as she was coming near the edge. 
�How do I get this off of you?� Cheyenne 's hands grabbed the strap over Gabrielle's
  folded arms and tugged hard. 
�You can't get it off without the key.� 
�I want you.� Cheyenne 's voice had a demanding huskiness to it. And she was
  not about to let the leather come between her and her prize. �I'll get a knife
  and cut it off.� 
�You will not!� Gabrielle was becoming defensive. �This outfit cost a fortune.
  You ruin it and I will never talk to you again.� Gabrielle's hips had slowed
  down their motion. �I love this suit.� 
�I love you,� Cheyenne said, �but I have to have you.� Cheyenne had renewed
  her pelvic motion, slipping on the leather in her own juices. She tightened
  her embrace. �You feel so good wrapped in there. I want to be in there with
  you. I want to be strapped to you. I want to be sealed to you. I want to be
  locked to you forever. Oh, God.� After more moaning and snaking of her tongue,
  Cheyenne exploded in ecstasy and collapsed on top of her bound lover. Gabrielle
  could feel her panting, her own arousal sparked but far from complete. That
  was the maddening wonderfulness of the suit. Such sensations and nowhere to
  go with them. 
�Well�look at you two,� he said, leaning in the doorway. Both girls looked
  at him, his arms folded. �Suppose you want this.� He held up the key to the
  suit with the key chain remote. His thumb was very near the red button. 
�Oh, God,� Gabrielle said, knowing what was coming next. His thumb pressed
  lightly on the button and the �buzzers� inside the suit over the nipples and
  nether regions vibrated for a moment. Cheyenne could feel the �buzzers� and
  the shiver that they sent through Gabrielle. He teased the button again, and
  Cheyenne was raised up on Gabrielle's powerful single-leg, pushing for the
  ceiling. Gabrielle bit her lip and closed her eyes, willing back the torment
  of pleasurable pain. He pressed the button a third time and held it down. Cheyenne
  became instantly excited at the reaction of her lover to the mischievous little
  devices sewn into the suit. Cheyenne sadistically held Gabrielle down by laying
  on top of her chest to chest, keeping her from thrashing around to minimize
  the effect, her own nipples feeling the buzz through the leather and enjoying
  the sensation. Like a boiling cauldron, Gabrielle began to shiver and quake
  until she finally gave in to the pleasure and crested the hill of her lust,
  sliding happily down the other side. He knew she was done and stopped the �buzzers.� Too
  much could get uncomfortable. 
Half an hour later, Cheyenne sat in a chair on the other side of the bedroom,
  her torso and arms locked efficiently in her own black leather straight jacket,
  the crotch strap pulled tightly through her legs. He didn't have the leg sheath
  complete yet, so her legs were in tight leather pants with laces up the back
  to pull them closed. Her feet were locked into a pair of high heel boots. To
  keep her in the chair, a set of straps held her down, with straps securing
  her ankles to the legs of the chair. She was watching with rapt attention as
  he began to free Gabrielle. Being wrapped in leather, Cheyenne now understood
  Gabrielle's desire not to cut that diabolically wonderful suit. 
First off was the boot, exposing her sensitive feet. He ran his finger firmly
  from heel to toe and caused her foot to curl. She giggled slightly. He blew
  on the arches of her feet, tickling her with his breath. It was delicious to
  feel and watch. He then rolled her onto her stomach on the bed. He undid the
  buckle-locks on the sheath and she could feel the tension relieving itself
  from the leather. The zipper was pulled down, exposing the laces underneath.
  Then with careful concentration, he picked up a pair of sharp surgical scissors
  and began to cut the lacing from the top down. It was a lot easier to get new
  laces than to have to try to save the old ones, plus the sensation for Gabrielle
  was better. The cutting of the laces split open the seam of the sheath and
  her legs separated. The cool air hit her sweaty skin, causing it to tingle.
  He spread the sheath out and massaged her legs, working out the kinks from
  their bondage. He then tickled her again, this time on the back of the knee,
  causing her to lift her legs and wiggle. 
Snap. The excruciating pleasure of the tight crotch strap disappeared as the
  lock was undone. A cold blast of air hit her soft spot, and he helped by blowing
  a jet of air with his mouth at it. It felt good, but almost made her need to
  pee. 
Snap. Snap. Snap. Snap. Snap. The buckles were unlocked and she felt her body
  begin to expand after being relieved of the pressure of the leather. He undid
  the buckle that held her arms behind her back and undid the zipper. The laces
  were cut in the same manner as the sheath. As the tightness subsided, her lungs
  drank in the air and her chest expanded most delightfully after its tight constriction.
  He rolled her on her back and undid the straps around the arms. He grabbed
  the ends of both sleeves and the jacket was pulled off in one sweeping motion. 
Her body felt the cold of the room and her skin glistened with sweat. She
  stretched and massaged her limbs and he began patting her down with a soft
  towel. All the while he was doing this, he would blow gently on her, sometimes
  a cool jet of air, and sometimes a hot blast. He stood on the side of the bed
  and picked up her limp body in his arms. Her arms wrapped around his neck and
  her face cuddled into his chest, wanting to stay close to him. 
� Bath time,� he announced. He stopped and turned to Cheyenne . The two of
  them looked at the prisoner in the chair; both with a mischievous look in their
  eyes. Cheyenne was slightly apprehensive and very turned on by it. �We'll both
  have fun with you later.�
