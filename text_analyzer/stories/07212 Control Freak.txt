 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- Part 1 -

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I came to about three days later with little memories of what had happened. Gradually, working with a hospital therapist on a daily basis, I started to fill in the �holes� in what had been my memory. Most of my memory came back to me in the first few weeks. But it was very difficult to try to remember the night of the accident. Only after a number of months did the fog start to lift in my mind and I could remember back and know what had happened. Up to a point, that is.

It was the night of our graduation from high school and me and my four best buds were out to have a good time. We had hit the ground running right after the ceremonies and didn&#8217;t stop until we had been to four of our small town&#8217;s five bars. Mel was our �leader�, just as she had been all throughout school. She had gotten a bright red Camaro for graduation and she wanted to bust loose. So she talked the rest of us, Trish, Megan, Katie and me into hanging with her for the night. Dressed to kill, we took to the night like we owned it. 

Everybody was our friend and we got more offers from guys of all ages, than any of us could handle for a hundred years. We were on top of the world and we knew it. There was nothing that could stop us�.

But then the unthinkable happened. Driving too fast into a turn, Mel swerved just a bit over the center line. In an instant everything changed and our lives and world were shattered. Normally that road would have been okay to drive fast down and with virtually no traffic ever, Mel&#8217;s maneuvering wouldn&#8217;t have been a problem. But that night, fate stepped in and dealt us a raw deal. A large Semi was headed in our direction. Perched up high in his cab, the driver had seen Mel&#8217;s Camaro come barreling down the road towards him and being new to the truck, had tried to swerve out of the way, by quickly steering towards the right. Unfortunately, his action threw the rest of his rig into a jackknife position and causing the back end of the truck to swing around and slide into our lane of travel.&nbsp; As we entered the turn, I ducked down to snort a line of coke from Katie&#8217;s compact mirror. That was the last thing I would remember from the accident. No amount of therapy ever brought back what happened in the next few seconds. 

According to the police report, Mel was doing just over 80 M.P.H. when she collided with the back half of the truck. The angle of her car took it directly into side of the trailer just in front of the rear wheels. The body of the truck acted like a razor sharp knife and sheared off the top of the car as if was made of cheap plastic. All four of the girls were decapitated instantly. I was the only survivor, saved by bending over to do a line. The truck driver was shaken so badly that he collapsed after stumbling out of the trucks cab and seeing what was left of the car, half under his rig. He would never drive another truck and ended up with a major case of post-traumatic stress disorder.  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
The police report said that while only suffering some blunt trauma to my head, when they arrived, I was still strapped in my seat in the right rear seat, covered completely in blood, and screaming uncontrollably. I was in a severe state of shock, the headless bodies of my friends still sitting next to me and I had �snapped�. It didn&#8217;t say that the first two officers to reach the scene had become violently ill when they too got to the car. It was the worst accident in the history of our town and, in fact the entire county. And I had basically walked away from it with just a bump on my head.

I first noticed that something strange had also happened to me about four or five months later. I was home at the time, my therapy now just two times a week and the therapist, a nice young woman from Honduras, would come to my parent&#8217;s home to work with me. I hadn&#8217;t gone out at all during all time since the accident, save to attend the memorial service given a month after the accident. There was no one I wanted to see and the parents of my friends haunted me, as I knew they didn&#8217;t understand how I survived but their daughters had all died. I didn&#8217;t know why either but I couldn&#8217;t face them yet.

But it was a bright late August day, the sun was shining and, for once, the humidity was extremely low. I had gone out to the back deck near our pool, to try to get a bit of a tan, and was wearing a simple �wife beater� tee shirt and my bikini bottoms. My hair had nearly all grown back on the top of my head where the Camaro&#8217;s top had nearly scalped me [despite the police report of a minor bump to my head, I had barely escaped the same fate as my friends and had suffered a deep cut on the very top of my head, which had put a dent in my skull].

So when Polo called out at the front door to see if I was home, I told her to come around the back. The back of our house is very secluded with twenty-foot high hedges on all sides, so we were hidden from any prying eyes. I used to sunbathe nude to get an all over tan every summer in high school &#8211; actually my mom and I used to all the time. A frustrated nudist, she often walked around the back yard with nothing on while doing some gardening or slipped into the pool to cool off and then to lie back on one of the lounge chairs and read, her bright red hair and bush blazing in the sun. I had inherited the same strip-off-my-clothes attitude ever since I was young and it was hard for my parents to keep any clothes on me when we went to the beach or a friend&#8217;s pool.

But that day I was covered up when Polo came out to the deck. I bade her sit down and offered her a glass of lemonade from the large pitcher I had brought out earlier. She accepted and after taking a sip, dug into her canvass bag and started to pull out her books and note pad. Always a bit serious, she insisted that we get to work almost immediately as soon as she arrived for each session. Today was no exception.

But it was so beautiful out that working was the last thing I wanted to do that day. It was hot and sunny and I was feeling a bit horny. It had been months since I had even thought about sex, pushing all such thoughts out of my head to focus on my therapy and working on getting my mind working right again. Before the accident I had been pretty much consumed by thoughts of sex every day, buried mostly in my subconscious but there nevertheless.

So when Polo reached into her bag, I suddenly leaned back and stretched languorously, letting my tee shirt ride up a bit and one of my bare breasts poked through the sleeveless sides of the tee. I noticed that Polo glanced over and slyly looked at it. My nipple, with a mind of its own, began to thicken and elongate. The tingling I used to get in the sensitive tip slowly roused itself and I felt it start to work its way down to between my legs. I was becoming aroused.

But wait, I thought, I know I used to get horny at the thoughts of guys but not with girls� I know I like girls, but not like that... I continued in my mind. But then I looked over at her and saw that she was really very pretty with her dark Spanish skin and large brown eyes. Her body moved easily in her thin summer dress, the material barely containing what looked like a set of very big breasts and a shapely ass. Suddenly I wondered what her breasts looked like naked and how I&#8217;d love to see her stretched out on the lounger.

And that&#8217;s when it happened; she suddenly pushed her stuff back in her bag and turned towards me. My mouth fell open in surprise when she reached behind her and started to unzip the back of her dress, saying in a low, husky voice:

�You want to see my teats, don&#8217;t you?�

I could only nod my head in agreement as she pulled the dress down around her and then stood quickly to pull it over her hips and onto the deck. She bent forward and then her bra was off and also at her feet. She took a step towards me and nuzzled those large breasts over my face. I reached up and rubbed my open palm over the very large and dark aureoles with their inch long nipples poking out from the center of each. I was panting now and Polo fed first one and then the other nipple into my eager mouth, humming a strange tune. I slipped my hand between her legs and found her white cotton panties had a large wet spot in front. I lightly rubbed my fingers over the thin material and she trembled a little, the spot getting much larger and very, very wet.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is very strange I thought. One minute I&#8217;m horny and thinking about what her body would look like and the next minute, she&#8217;s taking off her dress and having me suck on her breasts as if we&#8217;ve been lovers for years. It was almost as if she read my mind, I thought. But I&#8217;ve never had that happen before, I thought. Even with the memory loss since the accident, I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;d have remembered if I could do that from before. Maybe she&#8217;s a mind reader, I thought, but she keeps it to herself. Of course, that still doesn&#8217;t answer why she suddenly just stripped off right now. Nor why she suddenly seems as horny as I am, either.

I was pulled from these thoughts by Polo, suddenly grabbing at my head and pulling me tighter to her chest, while she tried to pull her panties down over her wide hips. She wanted more and I found I was responding to her as I never had before with my former boyfriend, Matt. Her hands then left my head and she was pushing them through the arms of my tee shirt, grabbing hard at my breasts, squeezing my nipples between her thumbs and fingers, pinching them hard to the point where they started to hurt and were sending little shocks right down to my pussy and clit. I too, pulled at my bikini bottoms and stripped them from me, exposing my bare puss to the air. I was still mouthing her tits and then I was sucking hard on them, almost biting the turgid nipples in my frenzy. She responded by pulling my breasts up painfully and then her mouth was on them, sucking my nipples as hard as I was sucking hers. We were attacking each other&#8217;s breasts like two possessed demons, biting and hurting each other as it fueled our passion.

Then suddenly her hands dove down between my legs and she was pulling them open while pushing me down onto the lounger. She pushed me around so my legs were facing away from her and then, like an animal she was suddenly straddling my face, her soaking wet slit just inches from my mouth. And as she bent forward, I felt her mouth on my pussy and her tongue flicked out and down, parting my hairs as she slipped into my wetness. Lifting my head, I slid my tongue into her slit and felt her shudder again. Then slowly she lowered herself down onto my face, impaling her pussy on my tongue. I began to hum a little, a trick I remembered from my going down on Matt. The effect on Polo was electrifying!! 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Suddenly she was gyrating on my face, mashing her slit down hard on my mouth, her juices flowing over my lips and down my throat, grinding down on me as she got closer and closer to orgasm, my tongue still shoved deep into her pussy. I could feel her tighten and grip me hard, little ridges massaging my tongue, as she started cuming. And I felt her tongue force it&#8217;s way deeper into me as well, the tip of it hard and pointed, stabbing at my tender pussy and then, - 

Oh My God!!!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Her tongue scrapped over my G-Spot and my world exploded in fireworks of light and heat, I felt my ass lift up and, as she sucked hard on my clit, I went over the edge in a massive rush of cuming and cuming, I was screaming and crying and laughing all at once, and then I felt her pussy contract suddenly on my tongue as she came hard, too. She ground down hard on my face and then I felt her hands slide back over my belly to my nearly forgotten breasts, kneading them like soft dough. I slid my hands up to grasp hers as well and, as I found her nipples, she squeezed mine painfully. 

I responded by squeezing hers just as hard and then, as we dug our fingers into each others tender nipples as hard as we could, I could feel the second wave of orgasm crash down, taking both of us away at the same time until we were both thrusting our mouths into each others pussies, sucking as hard as we could on the others clit until both organs were bright red and rigid. And then we both gushed at the same time, our orgasms triggering our spasming pussys to ejaculate what seemed gallons of girl juice onto each other, soaking our faces, hair and the mattress of the lounger.&nbsp; Our tongues slurped at our reddened and swollen pussys, cleaning and sucking down all the wetness until the sense of urgency slowly faded and we could simply relax, comfortable in our warmth and sensuality. Polo arched up and then, swinging her legs around, came down to lie next to me, and we shared gentle kisses in the warm sun, our naked bodies sliding smoothly over each other, arms and legs entwined until we both fell asleep.

An hour later, Polo stirred and we both awoke. We kissed again but then suddenly she was sitting up and looking for her clothes, a sheepish look on her face. I found my tee shirt and pulled it over my head. I tried to get her to stop getting dressed and grabbed at her arm. She turned towards me but she had changed back to her �professional� persona, and the sexually charged Polo was gone. 

�I&#8217;m sorry� I &#8211; I don&#8217;t know what came over me� Please don&#8217;t tell the agency about what happened, I could lose my job� and, and, oh my god!, I could even lose my license�please don&#8217;t say anything, I beg of you��

Her voice trailed off into barely a whisper�..I held her tight and told her that I would never breathe a word of what we had done and that she shouldn&#8217;t worry about it at all. She got up and straightened out her dress, sniffling a bit. She asked if she could use the bathroom to �freshen up� before her next appointment and then suddenly she was gone. I knew I would never see her again, and true enough, the next week; the agency called and said that she had resigned and they would be sending someone else in her place. 

The next Tuesday a new therapist came to the house, a no-nonsense older matron who mumbled something about Polo suddenly requesting a reassignment to a different part of the city and she having to switch everything around to take me on. She was not happy about that at all.

That was my first inkling that something had changed with me. I was a bit afraid to try it on the new therapist, as she was too austere to even have such thoughts I reasoned and besides, I really had no desire to see her naked. Little did I know that I could have made her do anything I wanted her to do, just by thinking a certain way.&nbsp; I was satisfied with my session with Polo and had gotten the horny&#8217;s out of my system for a while��or so I thought��

 - Part 2 -

Iris Brittain was Polo&#8217;s replacement.&nbsp; After her grumbling initially about having to change her assignments, she had warmed up to Anne within a couple of weeks. She was quite strict though and allowed for very little small talk between her and her �patient�.&nbsp; She had set up what she referred to as her �Therapy Rules� in the very first session and Anne was suddenly confronted with an entirely different methodology, in which she now had to work. Iris refused to conduct her therapy sessions anywhere but in the small �sun room� off the main living room of the house. She asked that a small desk be brought in and would sit straight backed in the chair behind it for the entire session, scribbling down notes profusely, only asking a few scant questions during their hour together.

Anne was very put off by her demeanor and stubbornly refused to answer Iris&#8217; questions the first two times they met. As Iris was not given to changing her ways, a very awkward silence permeated those sessions. Anne quickly realized though, that she really had no choice but to comply with Iris&#8217; demands and her normally sunny personality just as quickly returned. She began to talk openly with her and soon felt that she was finally starting to make a break-through. Her mind, which had essentially shut down all these months since the accident, began to �remember� some of her past and she found that the last few days before the accident were coming back to her. Snippets of conversations she&#8217;d had with her dead girlfriends also bubbled up to the surface. But when she tried to visualize them in her mind, she couldn&#8217;t focus and that they seemed to be in a thick fog, their faces,&nbsp; dissolved into nothingness, as if an eraser rubbed away any features that they had. Their voices were there and yet they weren&#8217;t there for her to see. 

The first time it happened to her, the effect was so unnerving that Anne burst into tears and sobbed uncontrollably for nearly half an hour. No amount of comforting words from Iris seemed to help. Frightened by how deeply the memories cut into her, she gathered herself up and on wobbly legs got up, apologized to Iris for her behavior and quickly left the room. She rushed through the house and then hurried up the stairs to her bedroom. Her mother, putting groceries away in the kitchen, and hearing her run up the stairs called out to her but was ignored. She put the milk and orange juice containers in the &#8216;fridge and then walked over to the bottom of the stairs. There she met Iris, who had packed up her books and notebook into her bag, surmising that the session for today was ended, about to leave the house. Iris looked up at her and then quietly told Elise, as that was Anne&#8217;s mother&#8217;s name, that Anne had suffered a small set- back today but that it would eventually help her to better recover. She continued that Anne&#8217;s experience was quite normal for the type of psychological trauma Anne had been through and it might happen over and over again. The idea was that eventually the girl&#8217;s faces wouldn&#8217;t disappear when the old memory came back to her as Anne&#8217;s mind healed. Unfortunately, she added, no one could predict how long it would take before this happened. 

Seeing the shocked look on Elise&#8217;s face, she continued with a reassurance to the mother that fortunately Anne was quite young and very resilient. She said that she would return next week and that Anne should be okay until then. Any outbreaks would probably result in a similar reaction of crying and a rush to go to the sanctuary of her room, she added. She did give her business card, though, saying that if Anne became overly stressed, then Elise should call her and she would come over to talk with her. She had encountered this behavior in a few patients in the past and found that an extra therapy session or two would sometimes help. With this Iris picked up her bag and went to leave the house. 

Elise, still a bit apprehensive that everything would be alright, made her way up to Anne&#8217;s room. She stood outside her door for a long time, hearing the sounds of sobbing from within but decided not to disturb her daughter. After some time, she quietly tipped-toed away and went down the hall to her bedroom.&nbsp; She closed the door behind her and then went to sit at the far side of the large 4 poster bed and dialed the phone on her night stand. She spoke softly into the receiver to Jilly, her husband Fred&#8217;s secretary. He was in one of his interminable meetings but when Elise told her it was about Anne, Jilly told her she would get him immediately. Within a minute or two, Fred picked up the phone, breathing hard from running out of the meeting. 

�Elise, what&#8217;s wrong with Anne?� he practically yelled into the phone, wheezing from being nearly out of breath. He had feared every day since the tragic accident that Anne might one day �snap� and suffer some kind of nervous breakdown. He had always been a very protective dad and had almost refused to let her go out that fateful night, but had relented after both his wife and daughter had reassured him that Anne was old enough to go out on her own with her friends. 

Anne had always been a sensible, down-to- Earth, young girl and not given to the hijynx of other girls her age. He had not been entirely convinced but she went anyway. That Anne had somehow managed to survive the crash while the others had not, had plagued his mind ever since. He didn&#8217;t know why she had ducked down at that precise moment, he only knew that she had and that that one act, for whatever reason, had spared her. As the car was totally wrecked and also drenched in blood and body parts, the cops hadn&#8217;t completely examined the car but had had it towed to the impound yard and left in the very back of the lot, in an effort to keep the curious townsfolk as far away from it as possible.&nbsp; It eventually ceased to be of interest to anybody and slowly rusted away. 

As Anne was too traumatized to tell anyone what had happened and the compact&#8217;s mirror had broken, when it flew out of Anne&#8217;s hand, the cocaine was never discovered. The cops never administered a breath-a-lizer test on Anne as they knew she wasn&#8217;t the driver and given her state, the hospital spent more time on getting her cleaned up and examined for any injuries rather than testing her for any substance abuse. 

Besides, everyone knew that the five girls had been drinking, as they had hit almost every bar in town. So Fred concluded that Anne had bent over simply because she had had too much to drink and was about to pass out.

�Fred, relax hon, Anne&#8217;s going to be alright.� Elise said to him. She knew he was agitated and she wanted him to calm down a bit. His blood pressure had been rising since the accident, despite the fact that Anne had been unhurt, but she knew he was a worrier and, at his age, that was not a good thing.&nbsp; She quickly told him what had happened and what Iris the therapist had told her. He told her that he was going to head home but she told him that there was really no need, she would look in on Anne after she got off the phone with him, but that he should just come home at a normal time. She said good bye and hung up the phone.

Back in his office, Jilly watched her boss gradually calm down after initially rushing out of the meeting as soon as she had slipped in to tell him Elise was on the phone. He had jumped up as soon as she told him that it was about Anne, mumbled something of an apology to his boss and hurried to the phone. Everyone at his work, of course, knew what had happened in the accident and his boss knew that he had to run to take the call. Fred had confided in him only a few weeks earlier that he expected that Anne would someday suddenly remember everything about the accident and that there was no telling how she would react. Fred had told him that he thought she might suffer a complete breakdown and the two of them had discussed it over a couple of beers that night at the local bar after work. A kind and older man, he sympathized with Fred&#8217;s plight and had reassured him that if something like that ever did happen that he was to just drop everything and go to his daughter&#8217;s side, saying that family was more important than his job just then.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Jilly was also concerned about Fred. She had seen him change in the last couple of months as well. Hired a couple of years ago right out of high school she had blossomed in that time into a quite striking young woman. She had become his assistant almost from her first day there and she had been a valuable asset to him in his career.&nbsp; She was smart and well read, and soon Fred found he could rely on her to take over a number of the smaller assignments, freeing him up to spend more time on the large accounts. They worked together like a well oiled machine and soon his boss gave him a well deserved raise and he was promoted senior executive vice president. Jilly got a raise and a promotion as well. With her new found wealth, she began to dress better, even hiring a shopping assistant to help coordinate her wardrobe.&nbsp; 

He always had an entirely professional manner, but she had felt a slight undercurrent of feelings between them and once, when it was late and they were hurrying to meet a deadline for a client&#8217;s report, they had accidentally collided coming out of his office. Flustered, he had apologized profusely to her, but she just cracked a bad joke about it. That broke the tension and both of them laughed until she was crying. When he took a tissue to wipe the tears off her cheek, she suddenly fell into his arms. The kiss was hot and passionate and she held him tight to her. 

Embarrassed by what he had done, he hurried back to his desk, muttering under his breath another apology. This time she followed him back to his desk and then took his hands in hers.

�Fred, it&#8217;s alright.� She said; �That was my fault, not yours. I&#8217;ve wanted to kiss you for so long and, well, it just sort of happened.�

&nbsp; �But &#8211;� Fred hung his head and wouldn&#8217;t look at her.

�Really &#8211; �
She smiled warmly at him and rubbed his hands between hers. Fred finally looked up at her. There was a brief pause, as if all the air was suddenly sucked out of the room. 

She took a step toward him as he sat back in his black leather chair. And then she was on his lap, her kisses hard and hot. He stiffened for a moment as the last of his resistance to her drained away, his hands on her shoulders, his mind whispering to him to push her away. But he was under her spell and not able to control himself. He succumbed to her kisses and then was hugging her tightly to him, feeling her heat burning through her dress and lingerie. She was desperate now and pulled feverishly at his shirt and tie. Loosened by her fingers, his shirt was suddenly torn open and with a low growl, she pushed it down over his shoulders and arms. Caught, he tried to move his arms and found that she had effectively pinned them to his sides.

As he struggled to free his arms, she suddenly stopped kissing him and turning in his lap, pressed her hands into his arms forcing him down a little into the chair. Bending down she licked up his chest, her sharp tongue digging little furrows in his chest hair.&nbsp; As her tongue slid up his neck and across his cheek, her nails cruelly dug into his arms until he gave a little yelp. She was scaring him and he started to shake. 

�What&#8217;s the matter, lover?� she whispered into his ear. �Don&#8217;t tell me you&#8217;re not excited��

Her right hand left his arm and she slipped it down over his exposed stomach and then under his underwear. He was hard and the tip of his cock was wet with pre-cum.

�Well, now, I think I have the answer to that�hmmmm, don&#8217;t you agree?� she again whispered in his ear, followed by a girlish giggle. 

He went rigid and his cock suddenly grew another two inches as she simultaneously bit his ear lobe and dug her finger nails deep into the thin flesh of his cock. The pain shot through him and he nearly cried out but then almost as quickly as it had hit him, the pain was gone.&nbsp; 

She slid off his knees and pulled her hand from his pants. Standing up in front of him, she unzipped her skirt at the side and he watched, mesmerized, as it slipped down off her hips to puddle on the floor. Somehow she had taken off her shoes, he didn&#8217;t remember when and, as she stepped out of her skirt, he saw that she wasn&#8217;t wearing any panties.&nbsp; She was also very, very wet.

Looking down, she saw the perplexed look on his face that she wasn&#8217;t wearing panties. She shrugged her shoulders and said:

�It saves time.�

 He was shaking uncontrollably now, his arms still tight at his side. Pulling her blouse over her head, she quickly squatted down and reached for his belt buckle. Undoing it, she unzipped his pants and then with a sudden hard tug on them, pulled them down to his knees. His erection tented his boxers and she saw how wet they were across the front. His eyes had taken on a glassy look and he made no move to stop her. She unclasped her bra and her large breasts fell out, the dark aureoles stiffening in the air. Her nipples had always been extremely sensitive and they now grew until they stood out more than an inch. She rubbed them over his knees and then across his groin, pushing them against his erection. He began to whimper softly. 

�Yes, that&#8217;s much better, isn&#8217;t it�� she said looking up at him. Her tongue licked her lips obscenely. 

�I think I had better free you, big boy, before you explode.� She continued, reaching into his boxers and pulling his stiff member out through the large fly. She was tender this time and merely rubbed her fingers up and down the shaft and tickled the large bulbous head. Gently pulling his balls from under his cock, she played and toyed with them until she felt them start to tighten up and his breathing got heavier. Pressing down hard at the base of his cock, she slowed him down, preventing him from cumming. Excited by how quickly she had gotten him to this point, she realized that she wanted to draw it out as long as she could. She wanted him badly but only on her terms and when she was ready. Flicking a finger over her hard clit she also knew that would be very, very soon. 

She really had wanted him for a long time, that part was true, but she also had her own agenda. She wasn&#8217;t out to screw him out of his job and she didn&#8217;t want to be his wife either. She simply wanted to have him as her personal boy-toy. He wasn&#8217;t particularly rich but he made enough that he could set her up well enough for a long time. 

Deep down, she was very lonely, having lost her parents years ago in an accident aboard a cruise ship. This had happened at the start of her freshman year in high school and she had become very withdrawn, her natural shyness fueling her grief over the death of her parents. She had retreated into books and became a voracious reader. Her father had a huge library in their home and she found he had books on nearly every topic and a large collection of first rate novels, all bound in rich brushed leather. She had also discovered a hidden room that held an extensive collection of erotica, most of it very old and which included some illustrated selections. These books she read thoroughly but realizing they were �special�, only read them at night when she was alone in her bed.

Over the four long years there she had only made one friend, a female exchange student from Nicaragua named Polo. Jilly was nearly fluent in Spanish, as her parents had originated from Cuba and Polo needed help with her English, so they had become friends. But Polo was more outgoing than her and by her senior year had a large circle of friends. She had gone off after high school to get her degree in physical therapy at the local community college and the two lost contact.

Jilly smiled down at Fred&#8217;s dripping cock and then began to flick her tongue over and around the head. He started to squirm a bit and she squeezed down. 

�I wonder if you taste as good as you look� she said looking up at him with a devilish smile. They locked eyes, Fred feeling like a puppet controlled by a cruel mistress, unable to tear his eyes from her steady gaze. Then without looking away she suddenly opened her mouth wide and took him whole, deep into her wet warm mouth. He bucked again and she slid further down his now engorged cock. She sucked hard and swirled her tongue around the head, while her fingers pulled and tugged hard on his aching balls. He was close to cumming she knew and she slurped harder. Freeing one hand, she slid it down over her left breast and, making sure that Fred was watching, she viciously grabbed the turgid nipple, pinching it hard and pulling it down, like she was milking it. A guttural sound came from her throat and then her hand slipped further down and was furiously rubbing up and down her sloppy wet slit. The guttural sound was like a drop of water on a hot griddle to Fred&#8217;s cock. With a loud groan, he was suddenly cumming; pouring thick ropes of cum down into her hungry mouth, his cock pistoning farther and farther down her throat. 

Jilly exploded as her fingers rubbed hard over her clit, making little pulses of pleasure rocking up to her nipples and then back down to her pussy, each wave building on top of the previous one until she had cum so many times she lost count. And still she sucked hard on the cock that filled her mouth, pulling from it seeming gallons of thick luscious cum that she eagerly gulped down.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

Then she started to feel the ache of yearning deep in her pussy. Despite her cumming by rubbing her clit, she also wanted, no, she needed to feel Fred&#8217;s cock, hard and hot, filling her pussy. Her vaginal walls stiffened and grabbed at her finger as she slipped it into the tightness. Locating her G-Spot, she pushed her finger up hard on it and rubbed vigorously while her walls convulsed and spasmed. A gush of girl juice squired out of her, coating her hand as she came again. Fred&#8217;s cock slowed its relentless thrusting and slowly began to soften and deflate in her mouth. 

She began to hum a non-descript song as she felt him soften. The vibrations from her humming reverberated in Fred&#8217;s cock and, combined with a sensuous tongue bath, he soon started to get hard again. He was still caught in his shirt and as he struggled, she pushed him down harder into the chair. Her hard nipples scraped against his thighs. He was breathing heavy again, his mind blank focusing on the pleasure she was giving him. 

With a slutty �Pop� Jilly suddenly pulled her mouth off of Fred&#8217;s now rock hard cock. She playfully gave it a slap with her palm and watched as it swung back and forth. Fred groaned in frustration. Despite having cum only a few minutes before, he found he was ready again. Her teasing act had excited his imagination and his libido to heights he had never felt before. He lay back panting hard as he watched her.

Grasping the base of his cock, she quickly crawled back up into his lap. Spreading her legs wide she squirmed down until she had the tip of his cock positioned directly under her pussy. Then, as she rocked forward and gave him a lingering, wet kiss, she sat down slowly on his cock, feeling it slide into her, and filling her completely. He strained upwards but her arms wouldn&#8217;t let him move more than a few inches. 

�Why Lover, you&#8217;re not trying to move, are you?� she said to him, as she ground herself down on him. 

�But I want you to just stay nice and still. I&#8217;m going to use that hard cock of yours to get myself off.� She said through clenched teeth.

Fred could only lie there under her full weight on his arms, feeling like a butterfly pined to a table as Jilly humped his lap. He was simultaneously scared of her and highly stimulated. As he was held down he could only rock back and forth as she used him as her own fuck-toy. His cock was rubbed raw as her pussy clamped on to it and she rode him hard. He thought he should say something about the pain he was feeling but one look into her eyes made his words dry up. He had no choice but to accept the pain. He knew that if he said anything, she would either just ignore him or worse, she&#8217;d grind harder into his groin. And probably dig her nails into his arms again, as well. 

She saw the beginning of a thought flash across his face for an instant and then he looked like he was going to say something to her.&nbsp; Secretly smiling to herself, she saw the confused look on his face and knew that he had succumbed to her domination over him. Now the fun starts, she thought and ground into him harder and faster. The thought caused her pussy to tingle and gush. With a series of sharp loud grunts, she rode him to her orgasm as hard as she could. He cried out over and over again, but she ignored him, as her pleasure was the only thing that mattered to her. 

She finally stopped moving and quickly pulled his spent cock from her pussy, releasing a stream of girl juice and sperm that flowed out of her. Climbing off his lap, she bent down and pulled up her blouse and skirt from under his desk. Smoothing her clothes, she straightened up and walked over to her shoes. Slipping them on, she turned to see him still slouched over in the chair, his pants and boxers still at his knees.

�Better get dressed, Fred.&nbsp; I think I hear the cleaning crew coming down the hall. Wouldn&#8217;t be good if they caught you with your dick out in the open.� She said as she walked out of his office, shutting the door behind her.

But that had happened well before the accident�
