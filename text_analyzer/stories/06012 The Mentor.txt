&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Mentor, Chapter 1

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I first spotted her right after I checked into the hotel, as I turned to walk toward the elevators.&nbsp; The conference was being held in one of those 

modernistic hotels built in the 1960s or 70s with a large atrium and a bank of glass-walled elevators.&nbsp; Susan � not Sue, or Susie, or any of those 

diminutive forms which would never have suited her personality � could be seen through the glass of one of the elevators that was just leaving the 

lobby.&nbsp; She was easily recognizable in her stylish green suit (probably Ann Taylor, knowing her) with the skirt cut a good three inches above her 

knee, and her signature flaming red hair styled in a short wedge cut that had been so popular recently.&nbsp; She had what could only have been a $300 

Herm�s scarf tied around her neck, and was wearing pointy-toed shoes with a spiked heel at least two inches tall, the kind that Sarah Jessica Parker 

was always wearing on Sex and the City.&nbsp; The shoes only added to her height which must have been at least 5�9� in bare feet.&nbsp; She didn�t see me, as 

she was turned and talking with what looked like a young graduate student.&nbsp; I was rooted to the spot, following the path of the elevator until I could 

no longer see them.&nbsp; I shook my head, smiled to myself, and continued forward to catch the next elevator with my suitcase in tow.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; **********

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I had known Susan Bascom for about ten years, ever since we had finished graduate school at the same time.&nbsp; We were in different programs 

back then, both top-ranked and well-respected, and our areas of research were not exactly the same but were similar enough that our paths crossed 

frequently.&nbsp; We both had specialties in 19th century English literature, with her focus being on the representation of gender, and mine being the role of 

broader social forces in the development of the novel during that era (back when I was starting graduate school men did not do gender studies).&nbsp; We 

began our job search at the same time, enduring the meat market of the Modern Language Association Convention � or MLA, as it is unaffectionately 

known � as best we could.&nbsp; 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Susan was different than most of us, however, as she had had a moderately successful career in publishing before she went back to graduate 

school.&nbsp; She had risen to the rank of associate editor at a publishing house known for its highbrow literature list that was supported by more popular 

works.&nbsp; Thus, while most of us were in our late 20s when we finished school and began looking for our first academic posts, she was a decade our 

senior, knocking on the door of 40.&nbsp; To the casual observer, however, one would not suspect such an age difference as Susan was very youthful 

looking. She easily mixed with those of us who were younger, but the success she had achieved in the publishing industry was quite evident.&nbsp; Even in 

graduate school she always had the nicest clothes, the nicest leather briefcase, and the one time a conference was held close enough to her university 

that she could drive there rather than fly, we saw the fire engine red sports car she owned.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Susan and I were both relatively successful on the job market, each of us receiving multiple offers when many of our peers received none.&nbsp; Mine 

were a touch better, however, and I landed a plum position at a well-known university.&nbsp; She ended up at an institution that could best be described as 

�second tier,� not a bad one by any means but not in the same class as my employer.&nbsp; I would not describe our relationship as one of friendship, but 

we did generally see each other two or three times a year and always said �hello� and had some pleasant conversations.&nbsp; She had even met my wife 

Sarah a couple of times when she accompanied me to a conference.&nbsp; She and Sarah had gotten along fabulously, and I knew they stayed in e-mail 

contact with one another.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the ensuing decade, however, it was her career that had skyrocketed ahead of mine.&nbsp; Her first book came out to rave reviews less than two 

years after she finished her Ph.D., followed in quick succession by two more that were equally well received.&nbsp; She supplemented this with insightful 

journal articles that explored the representation of gender in mid 19th century England, and even branched out to examine the changing dimensions of 

sexuality during the same era.&nbsp; She was the darling of the academic conferences, the MLA and the smaller boutique gatherings like the one we were 

at now.&nbsp; She had received at least two major awards of which I was aware, and was granted tenure at her university in her fourth year, largely it was 

said to try to keep her there and discourage her from bolting to greener pastures.&nbsp; And much to everybody�s surprise, she had stayed, even in the face 

of annual gossip that she was being wooed by more prestigious settings.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Susan was also well known not just for her research but also for her teaching and mentorship of graduate students.&nbsp; She had a faithful flock of 

former students who were loyal supporters and were vocal in singing her praises.&nbsp; They could be found at conferences gathered around her, alongside 

her current students who she funded to attend the conferences and network in preparation for their own entry into the academic job market.&nbsp; There 

were always rumors about the nature of Susan�s relationships with these students but I had never heard any concrete evidence that there was any 

untoward behavior.&nbsp; I chalked up much of the gossip to professional jealousy.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While my career had developed respectably, it could no way be compared to the meteoric rise of Susan�s.&nbsp; I had produced a couple of books that 

were well received but in no way comparable to hers, and while I had earned tenure in the standard sixth year, my scholarly reputation could best be 

described as somewhat below that of most of my star-studded colleagues at my own institution.&nbsp; Nevertheless, a professor�s life is a good one, and 

while I knew I would never be among the glitterati at the MLA, I was happy.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ***********

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I entered the elevator, punched my floor, and rode upward gazing down at the lobby.&nbsp; Unlike the MLA, which was an annual mob scene with 

upwards of ten thousand faculty members spread out through hotels all over the city, this conference was much smaller with only about 500 of us all 

in the single hotel.&nbsp; I much preferred this kind of gathering, where you could actually connect with colleagues, spend some time with them, and not 

be overwhelmed by a program book that listed over 4,000 sessions on everything from �Simultaneously Marxian and Queer Comments on Jameson, 

Allegory, and Method� to �Taking Away the Threat: Cribs and The Osbournes as Narratives of Domestication.�&nbsp; As I looked down at the registration 

desk I saw a few more people queuing up to check in.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The chime sounded and I got out on my floor.&nbsp; I looked left and right down the corridor trying to guess which way was my room.&nbsp; As I looked to 

the left about five doors down, I spotted Susan and what I presumed was her graduate student, both with suitcases in hand, standing in the hallway 

talking.&nbsp; They were quite engaged in a conversation about something and hadn�t noticed me.&nbsp; I wondered if they were sharing a room together, a 

wicked thought I know, but as I mentioned there had long been rumors that Susan�s relationship with some of her students � both male and female 

alike � went beyond mentoring into what some would describe as a �close personal relationship.�&nbsp; She was single when she entered graduate school, I 

knew, and had not married since.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I took the opportunity to check Susan out a little more closely.&nbsp; Even though she was ten years older than I and approaching 50, she still retained 

a great figure.&nbsp; She wasn�t thin, by any standard, and had quite a few extra pounds on her, but she had great curves set off by a pleasingly plump ass 

and substantial breasts that she usually showed off with low-cut blouses underneath her suit.&nbsp; And she still had legs that were worth displaying under 

her short skirts � well, short by academic standards at least.&nbsp; With her height, though, she carried the extra weight very well.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not wanting to get caught staring at the two of them, I quickly turned to the right and hoped that was the correct direction for my room.&nbsp; As I 

glanced at the room numbers, I saw that I was in luck.&nbsp; A few more doors down and I reached my room.&nbsp; As I shoved the keycard in the lock, I 

looked to my left down the hall toward Susan.&nbsp; I saw the student walking further down the hall by herself.&nbsp; As I entered my room, I laughed at myself 

thinking that Susan would have been sharing her room with a student.&nbsp; That would have been a little too obvious, even for her.&nbsp; I shut the door, put 

my backpack down, and began unpacking my suitcase.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; **********

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The conference began early that evening with an opening address from an esteemed senior colleague in our field.&nbsp; I often wondered who 

bestowed the label �esteemed� on these people; all I knew was that the speech was invariably a yawner.&nbsp; The only way they got people to go was by 

scheduling it right before the opening reception, which offered free food and booze � well, not quite �booze� by any standard, but cheap wine and 

domestic beer.&nbsp; After all, this is an academic crowd with relatively few financial resources.&nbsp; The opening reception always went late into the evening 

as the attendees soaked up their last freebies for the next few days.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a couple of years attending these types of gatherings I�d learned to avoid the free food and just enjoy a nice meal out.&nbsp; I thought of myself 

as somewhat better than the rest of them, not bowing to the offer of free � but lousy � food and wine, but holding out for a better meal.&nbsp; I had made 

plans a couple of weeks ago to meet up with my friend Carl who was similarly inclined, and we found a nice Japanese restaurant a few blocks from 

the hotel.&nbsp; By the time we got back to the hotel, it was about 9:00, and we could hear the noisy gathering in the ballroom.&nbsp; We went into the empty 

bar located in the lobby to have a drink and continue our conversation.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As I sat down, I glanced over Carl�s shoulder at the restaurant that took up the other corner of the lobby.&nbsp; Not surprisingly given the late hour 

and the fact that the conference took up all the rooms in the hotel, it was largely deserted.&nbsp; I did spot one attended table, though, and just as I was 

about to turn my attention back to listen to what Carl was talking about (something about Dickens, most likely, as that was who he spent most of his 

waking hours thinking and writing about), I realized that it was Susan Bascom and her grad student sitting there.&nbsp; They too must have decided to 

bypass the opening reception.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Carl and I ordered our drinks, and he quickly downed his and excused himself, complaining about having to get up early for a panel on which he 

was presenting.&nbsp; I graciously offered to pay for his drink, and he just as graciously accepted.&nbsp; After shaking his hand and saying good-bye, I sat down 

again to finish my margarita.&nbsp; As I did, I glanced over again at the restaurant, just as Susan�s graduate student was standing up, purse in hand.&nbsp; She 

began walking away from the table, and as she did, I examined her in more detail.&nbsp; 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Having been focused on Susan when I saw them earlier, I had not yet formed much an impression of her student.&nbsp; She was young, probably only 

about 25, and was wearing casual clothes, a loose fitting beige top and dark pants � thus confirming her relative youth, as somebody further along in 

her studies would have been wearing interview clothes at this conference in order to impress potential employers.&nbsp; She was shorter than Susan, 

maybe 5�4� or so, and I could see she was relatively thin even in her loose clothes.&nbsp; She too had short hair, but unlike Susan�s red locks, hers were 

brunette.&nbsp; Her face could be described as somewhat plain, nothing you would think twice about if you passed her on the street.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As I signaled the waitress for my check, I watched the student cross the lobby and head toward the bathrooms.&nbsp; The bathrooms were down a 

small hallway off the lobby, between the restaurant and the bar.&nbsp; She entered the bathroom just as the waitress brought my check. As I reached for my 

wallet, I glanced over at the restaurant.&nbsp; Susan was paying her check, and as she stood up to leave, I saw she was still wearing the green suit I spied 

her in earlier.&nbsp; As she left the restaurant, she too headed toward the bathroom.&nbsp; Even though this brought her closer to me, I realized it would have 

been hard for her to see me, because of the position of some columns and large palms that helped separate the bar from the lobby.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the waitress walked away with my credit card, I watched Susan head down the hallway and into the ladies room.&nbsp; In the time since her 

student had gone in there, I hadn�t seen anybody else go in or come out.&nbsp; By the time my credit card and charge slip were brought for my signature, a 

good seven or eight minutes had passed since the student had gone into the bathroom, and three or four since Susan entered.&nbsp; I thought this quite 

curious, the two of them in there seemingly all alone.&nbsp; I pondered what was going on as I signed the slip and put my credit card back in my wallet.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I sat for another couple of minutes, finishing the last few drops of my drink, still keeping an eye cocked toward the bathroom.&nbsp; Neither of them 

had exited, and given the fact that everybody else still seemed to be enjoying the reception in the ballroom (which undoubtedly had its own set of 

bathrooms), nobody else had gone in.&nbsp; By this time I was incredibly curious, and wondering what the hell was going on in there.&nbsp; I thought back to 

the rumors that had circulated about the relationship between Susan and her students, and decided I had to investigate this further.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I left the bar and headed toward the hallway where the bathrooms were located.&nbsp; I went down the hallway, which was long enough that one 

could not see the bathrooms from main part of the lobby area.&nbsp; As I approached the bathrooms, with the men�s on the left and women�s on the right, I 

glanced over my shoulder to make sure nobody was behind me.&nbsp; I knew the likelihood of anybody else coming to these bathrooms was slim, given 

that all of our colleagues were likely to still be enjoying the conference opening reception for some time.&nbsp; Seeing nobody there, I put my ear to the 

door of the women�s room and listened for a few seconds.&nbsp; Hearing nothing, I slowly pushed the door open just far enough to poke my head in, and 

as surreptitiously as possible, glanced around the door.&nbsp; 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What I saw was nobody � just the open area where the sinks were located, and a partition around which must have been located the toilet stalls.&nbsp; 

Once I determined that there was nobody right there, I quickly stepped inside, and quietly eased the door closed behind me.&nbsp; My first impression was 

that the women�s room was much nicer than the men�s room.&nbsp; There was carpeting on the floor, at least in the sink area, and a nice red velvet sofa 

and matching upholstered chairs.&nbsp; There was a selection of toiletries in the sink area for the women to use.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Still hearing nothing, I quietly tiptoed toward the partition separating the sink area from the toilet stalls.&nbsp; As I came toward it, I heard a very faint 

and muffled woman�s voice.&nbsp; I couldn�t make out what it was saying, but it was clearly coming from the other side of the partition.&nbsp; I&nbsp; poked my head 

around the partition very slowly and carefully.&nbsp; Luckily, there was nobody standing on the other side.&nbsp; As I suspected, this section of the bathroom 

contained the series of toilet stalls.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I slowly walked around the partition and stood immobile for a few seconds.&nbsp; A quick glance down the row of stalls confirmed what I suspected � 

there was only one door closed, and it was the one at the far end, which was the handicapped stall.&nbsp; From where I was standing, I couldn�t see under 

the bottom of the stalls, but I listened to see if I could pick up the voice again.&nbsp; Sure enough, I heard a voice coming from that stall.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The carpeting continued from the sink area into this section, but then stopped right in front of the row of stalls.&nbsp; This allowed me to creep quietly 

toward the end of the row and the closed door of the last stall.&nbsp; As I got closer, I was careful not to get in front of the gap between the door of the stall 

and its wall, so as not to be seen by the occupants.&nbsp; I stopped a few feet before reaching the stall, still on the carpeting.&nbsp; From this position I could 

more clearly hear the voice, and it did not take me long to recognize it as Susan�s.&nbsp; I bent down enough so as to be able to see under the walls of the 

stall, and confirmed my auditory conclusion by spotting Susan�s bare legs and her stiletto heels spread wide and facing the door of the stall.&nbsp; I could 

see in front of her, kneeling on the tile of the floor, the trouser-clad legs of what had to be her student.&nbsp; I was now close enough to hear Susan�s voice 

quite clearly, even though she was speaking quietly.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �That�s right, sweetie, you�re doing just fine, just keep doing that,� she said, in a soft and soothing voice.&nbsp; There were other sounds coming from 

the stall, but I was at an angle that I couldn�t see what was going on in there, and I was fearful of being seen or heard myself.&nbsp; But from what I could 

see and hear, my mind started conjuring up quite a lovely image of that young grad student kneeling between Susan�s legs.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �Harder, sweetie, lick harder up and down.�&nbsp; Now there was no question of what was going on in there, and Susan�s voice drew me closer to the 

stall.&nbsp; I tiptoed a few feet forward, staying on the carpet so as to be quiet as possible.&nbsp; This brought me a bit closer, so that I could see a little bit 

through the crack between the door of the stall and the wall.&nbsp; But I was too far away to really see anything at all.&nbsp; But imagining what the young 

woman was doing to Susan had gotten me very aroused, and my pants were starting to tent pole as I had quite an erection.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �Okay, now stop,� Susan�s said, still speaking softly but in a commanding tone.&nbsp; I could see under the stall that the student stood up, and I heard 

the rustling of clothes.&nbsp; I panicked, not sure what I should do.&nbsp; I was afraid if I started to move too quickly back toward the door, they�d hear me.&nbsp; I 

decided I�d duck into one of the other stalls and pick my feet up, so they wouldn�t be able to spot my quite obviously men�s pants and shoes under 

the stall.&nbsp; Just as I started to do this, the door to their stall flew open, and Susan came out, followed by the student.&nbsp; I was frozen on the spot, and I�m 

sure I must have looked like the proverbial deer caught in the headlights.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �Bob!,� Susan exclaimed, not looking nor sounding entirely shocked to see me standing there.&nbsp; My first instinct was to run out of there, but I 

was worried about the off chance of somebody seeing me flying out of the women�s room and what the implications of that would be.&nbsp; 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before I could think any further, Susan said, �Don�t move or I�ll scream.�&nbsp; That decided things for me � the thought of Susan Bascom screaming 

bloody murder in the women�s room, and what that would likely bring into there was not something I wanted to experience.&nbsp; So I just stood there, not 

saying a word nor moving.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �You know Professor Arnold, don�t you Laura?� she said, turning to the young lady next to her.&nbsp; As I now looked at her, standing there next to 

Susan, with dusty smudges on her knees and her hair slightly disheveled, she looked as equally embarrassed as I knew I must have appeared.&nbsp; She 

just lightly nodded her head, without uttering a word.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �And that would be his erection,� she said, laughing heartily and pointing toward my crotch. �Well, Bob, so nice to see you, though I didn�t 

imagine this is where we�d first run into each other at the conference.&nbsp; I would ask you what the hell you are doing here, but I suspect I already know 

the answer to that one.&nbsp; You followed us in here, didn�t you?�

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now it was my turn to just nod my head, my mouth suddenly very dry and unable to articulate any words.&nbsp; I thought again about making a dash 

for it, but was afraid of what that might bring.&nbsp; And I was still worried about Laura standing there as a witness to this whole episode.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �Okay, professor, follow me.&nbsp; You too Laura.�&nbsp; Susan turned and walked back into the stall and grabbed her purse, followed by Laura doing the 

same. She then walked toward the sink area, me behind her, and Laura behind me.&nbsp; I didn�t know what else to do other than just follow along, unsure 

what her plan was.&nbsp; She put her purse down on the counter next to a sink, and reached in and pulled out a small digital camera.&nbsp; 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After pressing a few buttons, she said, �Okay, Bob, now go stand over near the sofa.�&nbsp; I did as she said, still unable to question or challenge her.&nbsp; 

I found that I was actually getting aroused, as even though I was scared about the situation in which I had found myself, I was also mesmerized by 

her commanding presence.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She turned to Laura and said, �Honey, open the door and peek out to see if anybody is there.�&nbsp; 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Laura immediately did as she was told, opening the door and sticking her head out.&nbsp; She let it go and reported to Susan, �No, Professor Bascom, 

there�s nobody there.�

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �Good.&nbsp; Now hold it open for me.�&nbsp; Laura held the door open, and Susan stepped outside a few feet.&nbsp; She lifted the camera, and pointed it toward 

me.&nbsp; I could see that she was framing a shot that would include the bathroom door, with the large silhouette of a woman on it, through to me, standing 

in front of the furniture that quite clearly delineated this as a women�s room.&nbsp; 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Susan smiled and quietly said, �Say cheese!�&nbsp; In a second, I saw the flash of the camera, and Susan stepped back into the bathroom, closing the 

door behind her.&nbsp; She turned the deadbolt lock on the inside of the door.&nbsp; �Now we�ll have a little privacy, won�t we?&nbsp; Won�t have to worry about 

anybody disturbing us in here.�

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She put the camera on the counter behind her.&nbsp; �And now we�ll have a little souvenir of your visit in here, won�t we Bob?&nbsp; And just in case 

anybody wants to question the photographic evidence, I have Laura here who will confirm that you were caught spying on women in here.&nbsp; Right 

Laura?�

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Laura once again meekly nodded her head, and Susan said to her in a sharper voice, �Is that the proper way to respond, my pet?�&nbsp; 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Laura quickly said, �No, Professor Bascom, I�m sorry.�

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �That�s better, sweetie.�&nbsp; She turned to me and said, �By the way, Laura is one of my most promising grad students.&nbsp; I know she�s going to have 

a great career ahead of her, aren�t you my sweet?�

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �Yes, ma�am,� Laura responded, without missing a beat.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �So, Bob, how have you been?� she asked, turning back to me.&nbsp; 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was still dry-mouthed, but managed to mumble, �I�ve been better,� in a quiet voice.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �What was that, Bob, I can�t hear you.&nbsp; Sounds like you need a little reminder of the proper way to speak to me, just like Laura did.&nbsp; Please 

speak up and address me in a more appropriate manner.�

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I stumbled for a second, not quite sure what she meant.&nbsp; But I knew I had to do something, so I responded by saying in a clear voice, �I�ve been 

better, Susan.�

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All of the sudden, we heard a sound at the door � somebody was trying to open it.&nbsp; Susan quickly said to us, �Go stand near that wall,� and 

pointed toward the wall right next to the hinge side of the door.&nbsp; We both did as we were told, and Susan walked over to the door, unlocked the 

deadbolt, and opened it a foot or so.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �Is everything okay in here?� I heard a voice from outside inquire

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �I�m sorry,� Susan said. �My student is very sick, it must have been something she ate.&nbsp; She�s using the facilities in here and was a little 

embarrassed at having anybody walk in on her, so I locked the door until she�s done.�

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The voice outside said, �Oh, I�m very sorry to disturb you � is there anything I can do to help?�

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Susan responded, �Oh how sweet of you to offer, but that�s okay, I think I have it under control.�&nbsp; She then said in a whisper, but loud enough 

that we could hear, �She seems to be going back and forth from the sofa to the toilet, if you know what I mean.&nbsp; So I�m afraid she�ll be in here for a 

little bit until I can get her up to her room.�

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The voice replied, �Oh, that�s fine, ma�am.&nbsp; With everybody in the ballroom, there�s really nobody who needs to use this restroom.&nbsp; Let me get 

the �temporarily closed� sign and I�ll put it in front of the door.&nbsp; Then when you are done, just call the front desk and let them know.&nbsp; That way you 

won�t be bothered.&nbsp; I hope your friend feels better.�

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �Thank you, I really appreciate it,� Susan said.&nbsp; With that, she closed the door and relocked it.&nbsp; Turning toward Laura and me, she said with a 

big smile on her face, �Now I know we won�t be bothered in here.&nbsp; Now where were we?&nbsp; Oh yes, I remember now � I was making sure Bob knew 

the proper way to address me.�&nbsp; Now I was very nervous, realizing that I was at Susan�s mercy and unlikely to be rescued from my predicament.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �Now Bob,� Susan continued, �You can address me as Professor Bascom, I think that would be appropriate given the situation you have found 

yourself in, don�t you?�

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �Yes, Professor Bascom,� I meekly replied, not knowing what else to do other than to go along with her little game.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �Much better, Bob.&nbsp; Now listen up.&nbsp; Given what you�ve done by following us in here, which I would consider somewhat inappropriate for a man 

of your professional standing, you better do everything I tell you.&nbsp; Otherwise I�ll share my nice photograph of you with a few select colleagues, 

backed up by Laura�s confirmation of what you did.&nbsp; You�ll do that, won�t you pet?� she asked, turning toward Laura.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �Yes, ma�am,� she replied.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �And you, Bob, are you ready to listen?�

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was still stunned that I had found myself in this situation, but knew I had no choice.&nbsp; �Yes, Professor Bascom.�

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; � �Yes Professor Bascom,� what, Bob?�

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �Yes, Professor Bascom, I am ready to listen to you,� I replied.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �Good,� Susan said, smiling once again. �Here�s what I want you to do.&nbsp; Go stand over in front of the sofa, facing me.&nbsp; And Laura, you go sit in 

that chair over there,� pointing to one of the chairs that was facing the sofa.&nbsp; I did as she said, and Laura walked over and sat in the chair.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �Now undo your belt buckle and lower your trousers to your ankles.�&nbsp; I hesitated, not sure I could actually go through with this.&nbsp; But upon 

seeing my hesitation, Susan hissed in a stern voice, �Do it, Bob � and you better start responding more quickly or you�ll be sorry.�

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Upon hearing the tone of her voice, I said, �Yes, Professor Bascom,� and quickly undid my belt and lowered my chinos to my ankles, standing 

there in my boxer shorts.&nbsp; My erection was still there, and I was afraid it was visible through my boxers, as even though I was incredibly fearful of 

what was happening I was still very aroused by Susan�s domination and control over me.&nbsp; I had a dress shirt on, so as I looked down I saw the shirt 

tails were at least partially covering my erection.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �Very good, Bob, you�re doing much better now.&nbsp; Laura, go over and unbutton his shirt, but leave it on.�&nbsp; Laura did as she was instructed, 

walking over and undoing the buttons one at a time from the top to the bottom.&nbsp; The hands of this young woman � who a few minutes ago had 

apparently been on her knees licking the pussy of the woman standing a few feet away �&nbsp; brushing against my chest made me even more aroused.&nbsp; 

Once she undid the bottom button, the two halves of the shirt opened up, with my erection poking through between them, leaving no doubt as to the 

state of my arousal.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �Hmm, it appears that you are enjoying this.&nbsp; Is that true, Bob?�

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I couldn�t respond, I was so humiliated.&nbsp; The thought that my body was so aroused by Susan�s control over me, combined with not just Susan 

seeing me like this, but her young graduate student seeing me in this state also, was just too much for me to comprehend.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �Bob, I asked you a question?� I heard Susan say.&nbsp; 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I knew I had to respond somehow, that I couldn�t ignore her.&nbsp; �I don�t know,� I replied, quickly adding, �Professor Bascom.�

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �Oh, c�mon Bob � a smart man like you?&nbsp; You�re so good at doing research and reading the evidence, I shouldn�t have to put two and two 

together for you, should I?&nbsp; First I catch you spying on Laura and me in here, with an obvious erection pushing out of your crotch.&nbsp; Then, when I start 

telling you what to do, I find that you still have a raging hard-on sticking out of your boxer shorts.&nbsp; Your mind may not know, Bob, but I�d say your 

body knows very well how it feels about this situation.�

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She was absolutely right.&nbsp; I was conflicted, my mind telling me that I was in big trouble, but my body was clearly responding with arousal.&nbsp; I 

just stood there, pants at my ankles, hard-on pushing my boxer shorts out.&nbsp; I glanced for a second to my right at Laura standing there, and I saw her 

mesmerized by what was going on, her eyes darting back and forth from Susan to me.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �Well, you don�t need to answer for me, Bob, as I said I can clearly see for myself.&nbsp; You are definitely turned on by this, and I think I know 

why.&nbsp; It�s because you�re aroused by the thought of a strong, dominating woman � one who is clearly better than you � telling you what to do.&nbsp; That�s 

it, isn�t it?�

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She had me pegged, and there was nothing I could do other than to say, �Yes, Professor Bascom.�

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She smiled back at me, just standing there with her arms folded, not saying a word, for what was probably only about 10 or 15 seconds, but felt 

like an hour.&nbsp; It was deadly quiet in the bathroom as Susan looked at me, and off in the distance I could hear the faint rumble of the other conference 

participants enjoying the reception.&nbsp; Oh, how I wished I hadn�t been so smug about that and had just joined the others there.&nbsp; Then I never would 

have found myself standing half-naked in a women�s room of a hotel, with Susan Bascom and one of her students watching me.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, Susan said to Laura, �Okay, pet, now pull his boxers down to his ankles.�&nbsp; Without hesitation, she put her hands on the waistband of my 

shorts and slowly yanked them down.&nbsp; They caught for a second on my erection, but she continued, pulling my cock painfully downward until it 

snapped back up as the waistband finally cleared it.&nbsp; She deposited them at my ankles, on top of my trousers.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I knew my face must have been beet red, the two women standing there looking at me like this.&nbsp; I was incredibly mortified at being here, but 

feared more the consequences of trying to extricate myself.&nbsp; I was fearful of what Susan would do if I didn�t cooperate.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �Now isn�t that a pretty picture, Bob standing there with his little penis sticking straight out.&nbsp; Don�t you think so, sweetie?�&nbsp; 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Laura, still standing next to me, said, �Yes, Professor Bascom, it is a pretty picture.�&nbsp; I didn�t get the impression that she was enjoying this one 

bit; in fact, she still looked scared herself of where this was going.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Susan reached behind her and grabbed the camera once again.&nbsp; I immediately thought, �Oh god, no, not a picture of me like this.�&nbsp; But I knew 

there was nothing I could do about it at this point.&nbsp; Susan raised the camera and held it a few inches from her face so she could see the screen.&nbsp; I saw 

the lens rotate in and out as she checked the zoom, and then once again the flash went off.&nbsp; 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Susan glanced at the screen for a few seconds and then smiled and said, �Yes, just lovely.&nbsp; You�re going to continue to cooperate with me, aren�t 

you Bob?&nbsp; You wouldn�t want me to send this to a few of your department colleagues would you, or perhaps Sarah?�

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Knowing I was utterly defeated, all I could say was, �Yes, Professor Bascom, I will cooperate with you.�

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Susan put the camera in her purse and snapped it shut.&nbsp; �Okay, now come here, pet.�&nbsp; Laura walked over to her, and Susan said, �Now take off 

my jacket and scarf for me.�&nbsp; As Susan said this, the image I had formed in my mind of her sitting in that toilet stall, Laura kneeling in front of her, 

came back into my head.&nbsp; I wondered if I were going to have an opportunity to see what had been I had been unable to spy a few minutes ago.&nbsp; The 

thought further aroused me, making my hard-on stick out even further.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Laura walked behind her, eased the jacket off her shoulders, and carefully folded it and placed it on one of the chairs.&nbsp; It was clear she had done 

this with Susan�s clothes numerous times before.&nbsp; She went back to Susan, and gently undid the knot of her scarf and took it from her neck.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �Thank you, sweetie.&nbsp; Now be a good girl and tie it around Bob�s eyes, will you?�

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �Yes, ma�am,� she responded, and for the first time I thought I noticed a hint of a smile on her face.&nbsp; She walked behind me, scarf in hand, and I 

felt the cool silk over my eyes as she pulled it tightly and tied the knot behind my head.&nbsp; I could see very little other than some light coming in 

through the top and bottom of the scarf, but looking straight ahead I could see nothing.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �And now my skirt, pet,� I heard Susan�s voice say, and felt Laura walk by me back toward Susan.&nbsp; I heard the rustling of fabric again, and felt 

Laura�s presence as she went back toward the chair, presumably to place the skirt with the jacket.&nbsp; �Just sit down on the edge of the couch,� Susan 

told her.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Again, it was quiet in the room for a moment, and then I felt Susan walk by me toward the sofa.&nbsp; It sounded like she sat down, and I heard a soft 

sigh emanate from her lips.&nbsp; �Okay Bob, turn around, face the sound of my voice, and take two steps forward,� she said.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I turned and shuffled forward, being careful not to trip with my pants and boxers clumped around my ankles.&nbsp; I stood there, waiting quietly, 

hearing nothing but the soft breathing coming from the two women.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �Now kneel, and lean your body forward slightly, spreading your arms wide and putting them on the sofa.�

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I did as she said, understanding now what was going to happen.&nbsp; As I put my arms down, I felt a soft silk-like material enveloping my head.&nbsp; I 

realized it must have been the slip that Susan was wearing under her skirt.&nbsp; As it rested on my head, the musky scent of Susan�s arousal hit my 

nostrils.&nbsp; It was quite evident that she too was turned on by what she was doing.&nbsp; I just stayed there, arms on either side of her legs, leaning forward 

with my head what must have been not more than a few inches from her crotch.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She just kept me there like that, not saying a word.&nbsp; Underneath her slip, I could not even hear her or Laura�s breathing.&nbsp; Again, it seemed like an 

hour that I was in that position, but it could not have been more than a minute.&nbsp; 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, I heard her voice again.&nbsp; �Okay Bob, now it�s time for you to learn a few things.&nbsp; It�s time for you to understand that I am in control, and 

that you are at my mercy.&nbsp; Think of yourself as one of my graduate students, my dear, whose fate and future is entirely in my hands.&nbsp; If you are good 

and do as I say, then you will be rewarded.&nbsp; But if you are bad, your career will be ruined.&nbsp; Do you understand?�

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once again, all I could say was, �Yes, Professor Bascom.�

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She hesitated a few seconds, and then she said, �Now lean further forward and begin licking.�

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 





























The Mentor, Chapter 2



I suggest you read chapter 1 of the story first



***********



The scent of her arousal was overpowering.&nbsp; I knew she must have been highly turned-on from the ministrations 

Laura had been performing on her when I caught them in the bathroom, and it was clear that her catching me 

and now dominance of me (along with Laura) was taking her to a more heightened state.



�Come on Bob, I told you to do something,� Susan commanded in a stern voice.&nbsp; I knew I had no choice but to 

continue doing what she told me, as I could not risk what she could do to my career if she chose to expose me 

for spying on her and Laura in the women�s room.



I did as she had commanded, leaning forward as my hands were spread out on either side of her legs resting on 

the couch.&nbsp; This brought my face in contact with her panties, which as soon as I felt them I could tell were an 

expensive silk variety.&nbsp; The first touch also confirmed the state of her arousal, as they were absolutely soaked 

through.&nbsp; I tentatively stuck my tongue out, touching it to the sodden material.&nbsp; I drew my tongue up toward the 

top of her slit, then downward, and continued this pattern a few times.&nbsp; As I did this, I realized that her panties 

were pressed tightly against her labia, with apparently no pussy hair propping them up off of her crotch.&nbsp; 

Somehow I was not surprised to learn that Susan was clean shaven down there.



�That�s a good, boy, now a little bit harder,� I heard Susan say as I continued.



Something in her tone of voice or her choice of words hit me, and I began to pull out from underneath her skirt.&nbsp; 

But as soon as I removed my tongue from her panties, I heard her hiss, �Did I tell you to stop?&nbsp; Now get back 

there and do as you�re told or there will be hell to pay, Bob.&nbsp; Just do everything I tell you and you�ll get out of 

here with your reputation intact, I promise.�



Then she added in a lighter tone with a chuckle, �But no promises about your manhood and pride.�



Resigned to my fate, I returned to what I had been doing, now applying more pressure to her slit as I continued 

up and down.&nbsp; It was hard to believe it could happen, but her panties seemed to be getting even wetter as I 

continued, almost dripping with her secretions, causing the air under her skirt to become even more fetid.



I felt her scoot her ass forward a bit, bringing her crotch into even stronger contact with my tongue and face.&nbsp; I 

felt her body relaxing also, as she lay back further into the couch and spread her legs a bit more, pushing my 

hands even wider on the outside of them.&nbsp; It was becoming difficult to maintain my balance, and my knees were 

getting quite sore.&nbsp; This made me think of what Laura had been doing to Susan in the stall just a few minutes 

ago, and I was thankful that at least I had carpeting underneath my knees.



�That�s better, my boy, you�re doing a much better job now.&nbsp; You�re obviously somewhat experienced at oral 

service, aren�t you?� I heard her saying.&nbsp; I figured it was a rhetorical question, and saw no need to reply, so I 

simply continued rubbing my tongue up and down her panties.&nbsp; They were now so wet that as I did this they 

were getting pushed between her plump pussy lips, which I could easily feel on either side of my tongue.



�Just divine, my Pet.&nbsp; I wish you could feel how lovely this is, Laura � he�s quite a good pussy licker I must say.&nbsp; 

I bet Sarah has you doing this a lot, doesn�t she Bob?� she asked.&nbsp; Again, I didn�t answer, a little worried that 

she was bringing my wife into the discussion.&nbsp; But then I heard her say, �I asked you a question, but I recognize 

it�s a little hard for you to answer given your current position.&nbsp; Tell you what � just nod your head up and down 

a little if the answer is �yes,� okay?�&nbsp; I moved my head up and down enough that I knew she could see the 

movement.&nbsp; 



I heard her reply, �I&nbsp; thought so � I suspected from my e-mail conversations with Sarah that you�d be very good 

at this.�



Hearing this, I froze � what the hell did she mean, �e-mail conversations with Sarah�?&nbsp; I knew she and Sarah 

had occasionally e-mailed with each other since they had met at a couple of academic conferences, but I never 

suspected that our sex life was a topic of their discussion.



�Oh, are you a little shocked to hear that we e-mail about this, Bob?&nbsp; Well, you�d be surprised at the things that 

we girls like to chat about.&nbsp; But please do get back to work, I didn�t tell you to stop.�



I simply sighed and continued licking her.&nbsp; I could only imagine what they had been chatting about.&nbsp; Sarah was 

a very sexual person, and we enjoyed a great sex life � including lots of oral sex � and I knew that she was 

certainly comfortable talking about sex.&nbsp; So I was not totally shocked to hear that she may � if Susan was telling 

the truth � have discussed our sex life with Susan via e-mail.



�Laura, you simply can�t imagine how nice this is.&nbsp; A distinguished professor like Bob here, on his knees, 

lapping away at my panty-covered pussy in a woman�s room.&nbsp; Maybe we could arrange for you to experience it 

too,� she said with a laugh.&nbsp; �But I�ll tell you what � for now, maybe I can just give you a better view of the 

proceedings.�&nbsp; With that, I felt the material lifted off of my head as Susan pulled her skirt up and evidently must 

have bunched it up around her waist.



The cool air felt good, as it had gotten quite hot and stuffy underneath the skirt.&nbsp; It also let some of the scent of 

her arousal out, so that I was not quite as overwhelmed by that heady aroma.&nbsp; But my sense of relief was 

replaced by a sense of shame as I realized that Laura now had a very clear view of my tongue running up and 

down Susan�s panties.&nbsp; I heard Susan sigh as she leaned a bit further back into the couch.&nbsp; 



�Isn�t he lovely, kneeling there attending to me, Laura?�



�Yes, Professor Bascom,� she replied.



�Oh, come girl, you can do better than that.&nbsp; Tell me what you think of what you�re watching?�



There was no reply for a few seconds, as Laura was clearly contemplating what an appropriate response would 

be.&nbsp; I then heard her say with a slight giggle, �It does appear that he�s quite good at what he�s doing, and not 

only that, but he�s enjoying it too.&nbsp; Look at his penis.�



As she said this, it brought my attention back to the fact that I still had quite an erection.&nbsp; I had long since 

passed the point of fear and shame, and was now just responding to the physical sensations as well as the 

psychological toll of being dominated by Susan.



�Oh yes, I see what you mean,� Susan laughed back.&nbsp; �He does seem to have quiet a raging hard-on, don�t you 

Bob?�&nbsp; I nodded again to acknowledge that I heard what she said.



�But now I want to feel you a little more directly, my sweet, so let�s have you get that tongue around my panties 

and directly on my pussy, shall we?�



Hearing this I began to lean back on my haunches and removed my hands from the sofa in order to use them to 

pull down her panties.&nbsp; But before I got too far I heard Susan�s stern voice say, �Stop � I didn�t tell you to move 

did I?�&nbsp; I froze and then returned to the position I had been in, leaning back forward again. 



�You don�t need to use your hands to do that, now do you Bob?� she said.&nbsp; �Use that dexterous tongue of yours 

to move my panties out of the way.�&nbsp; 



By this point my tongue was actually getting quite tired, but I knew I had no choice.&nbsp; I moved it over to the side 

of her panties and stiffened it in order to push them aside.&nbsp; As wet as they were, it was still difficult to move 

them enough to provide me with freer access to her pussy lips.&nbsp; She recognized my difficulty, and scooted 

around a bit, which helped loosen up her panties from her body.&nbsp; With some continued effort, I was able to 

move them aside enough that her big lips both popped out from the side of the panties.



�Ah, that�s much better, my Pet.&nbsp; You should now be able to do a much better job.&nbsp; Let�s see if you can help me 

cum.�



With the panties now at least partially out of the way I was able to get my tongue all over her labia.&nbsp; Confirming 

what I had suspected when I had first started, there was absolutely no pubic hair anywhere.&nbsp; She was perfectly 

smooth, without a trace of razor stubble.&nbsp; I gently sucked on each of her luscious lips, pulling each away from 

her crotch, running my tongue all over it.&nbsp; She was right � I had had a lot of experience going down on Sarah, 

and truth was, it was one of my favorite activities.&nbsp; And I knew from the way Sarah responded and from what 

she told me that I was very good at it.&nbsp; I hoped that if I was able to satisfy Susan that this would be the end of 

the entire affair.&nbsp; It would be an awful memory, but I prayed that it was just a bit of fun for her and she�d never 

speak of it again.&nbsp; And I trusted that she had enough control over Laura and her future that Laura would never 

speak of it to anybody if Susan told her not to.



So I concentrated on satisfying Susan, using all the tricks in my cunnilingus textbook to try to bring her to an 

orgasm.&nbsp; After sucking on her lips, I dove my tongue as deep as I could get into her pussy, touching the walls on 

either side.&nbsp; I then began to pay attention to her clit, lightly tonguing it, but was having difficulty because her 

panties kept getting in the way.



Susan must have sensed my problem, because I felt her sit upright a bit and heard her say, �Come here Laura, 

sweetie, I need your help.�&nbsp; I heard Laura rise from her chair, and as she did so, Susan said to me, �Okay, Bob, 

you can sit back for a second.�



I did as she told, relishing the opportunity to give my knees and tongue a break.&nbsp; As I pulled back and sat on my 

haunches, I could feel the cool air on my face, which was absolutely dripping from Susan�s pussy juice.&nbsp; 



As I felt Laura approach us, Susan said, �Okay honey, help me out here, will you?&nbsp; First of all, take off Bob�s 

blindfold for him.�



I felt Laura stand in front of me, between the two of us.&nbsp; As she did, I thought I could smell her arousal also.&nbsp; I 

couldn�t be sure, but I swore it was a slightly different scent from what I had been experiencing with Susan.&nbsp; I 

didn�t know if Laura was still in a state of shock, fear, or arousal, but given the olfactory evidence I thought I 

had encountered, I guessed it was the latter.



Laura reached down and pulled the scarf off of my head without untying it.&nbsp; I was blinded for a second as my 

eyes adjusted to the light of the bathroom.&nbsp; As my pupils shrank again, I looked straight ahead into Susan�s 

crotch.



This provided me with the first opportunity to see clearly the target of all my attention.&nbsp; I could see that Susan�s 

panties were a bright red color, though the wetness had turned the front of them almost maroon.&nbsp; They were 

askew, yanked partially to one side from my efforts, and I could see her plump pussy lips sticking out.&nbsp; As I had 

felt with my tongue, she was smooth and I contemplated for just a brief second how a woman could get herself 

that way.&nbsp; Sarah usually kept her pussy hair well trimmed, and on rare occasions had actually shaved 

completely, but there always seemed to be some stubble.&nbsp; I didn�t know whether Susan waxed, or had laser 

treatments or what, but she was absolutely smooth with no trace of hair.



I must have been fixated, staring at her, because Susan, �Enjoying the view, Bob?�



I jerked my head up, meeting her eyes with a guilty look on my face.&nbsp; It reminded me of times when I had been 

talking to a young student and caught myself inadvertently staring at her breasts.



As I now looked at her, I realized that at some point she must have unbuttoned her blouse, because the top three 

or four buttons were undone and the blouse was pushed aside enough to allow her two large, bra-encased 

breasts to be seen.&nbsp; The bra was a matching red to her panties and was trimmed with lace, and it displayed 

prominent nipples trying to poke through the silk material.&nbsp; The arousal that was so evident in her pussy was 

clearly echoed in her breasts.



�I said, are you enjoying the view Professor Arnold?� she repeated.&nbsp; As she said this, she reached a hand inside 

one of the cups of her bra and began to finger her nipple, rolling it around.&nbsp; It responded by becoming even 

larger than it was before, pushing against the red silk of the bra.



Not knowing how to respond to her question, I simply shrugged my shoulders.



Susan laughed and said, �Oh, you don�t have to answer that question.&nbsp; I know you well enough to know that you 

are enjoying it � you�re cock gives you away so transparently.&nbsp; You�re just a pussy-loving little Pet, aren�t you.�



At this all I could do was look downward, so as not to have to look at her eye to eye as she humiliated me.



She laughed again and turned to Laura.&nbsp; �Will you pull these off of me, sweetie � they have gotten so wet and 

they�re just getting in the way now.�&nbsp; I looked up again as I saw Laura move over and stand between us.&nbsp; She 

reached forward as Susan lifted her plump ass off of the sofa for a moment and moved her legs back together.&nbsp; 

As she had done with me, Laura put both hands on the sides of Susan�s panties and began moving them down 

her thighs.&nbsp; They were so wet that they just rolled up as they came down Susan�s legs and Laura gently pulled 

Susan�s still-clad feet out from them.



�You can go sit down now, sweetie, thank you,� Susan instructed.&nbsp; As Laura went back to her chair, Susan�s 

silk panties in one hand and her scarf in the other, Susan re-spread her legs and I could now see her pussy in all 

its glory.&nbsp; Perfectly smooth, with plump, bright pink lips.&nbsp; Moisture was glistening everywhere; she had 

obviously been so aroused that not even her panties and the action of my tongue had sopped it all up.&nbsp; As I said, 

I enjoyed performing oral sex on women, and I loved the look of a woman�s sex, especially when it was 

aroused.&nbsp; I had not had sex with a lot of women before I met Sarah, but had had enough that I enjoyed the 

variety of the surprise that awaited you when you saw that part of a woman for the first time.



Susan�s voice snapped me out of my reverie.&nbsp; �What are you waiting for Bob, get back here.&nbsp; Let�s get going, 

who knows when they�re going to need this bathroom again,� she laughed.



Responding to her command, I again leaned forward on my knees and began to move my hands to either side of 

her legs to rest them on the couch.&nbsp; But before I could complete this, she said, �No, wait � let�s do it a little 

differently this time.�



I stopped and sat back again.&nbsp; As I did, Susan said, �Come on your knees a bit closer, Bob.�&nbsp; I scooted forward, 

a difficult proposition given that my knees were very sore and my trousers and boxers were still around my 

ankles. 



�That�s good.&nbsp; Now Laura, c�mon back here for a second.�&nbsp; Laura did as she was told, and walked the few steps 

back to us.&nbsp; �Now, hon, take that lovely scarf of mine and tie Bob�s hands behind his back for me.�



Now I was afraid this was going too far.&nbsp; I had awful thoughts of being tied up and left by the two of them in the 

bathroom, only to be found by somebody else from the conference.&nbsp; I opened my mouth in protest, but upon the 

first word out of my mouth, Susan interrupted me.&nbsp; 



She must have been reading my mind.&nbsp; �Now, now Bob, don�t get too upset.&nbsp; I�m not going to do anything to 

put you in any danger.&nbsp; We just want to have a little fun with you, don�t we Laura?� she said, turning to her 

graduate student.&nbsp; Laura just smiled and nodded.&nbsp; �I promise if you finish up what I ask you to do here nobody 

other than the three of us will ever know what transpired here.�



I again began to say something, but Susan quickly turned back to me and once again hissed, �Do as I say Bob, 

or you�ll be very sorry.�&nbsp; She had me, and I knew it.&nbsp; I couldn�t risk what she would do to expose what had 

happened in here so I had no choice but to comply.



�Okay, Laura, go ahead.�&nbsp; With that instruction, Laura walked around behind me, as I resignedly put my wrists 

behind my back.&nbsp; She untied the knot that had held the scarf in place as a blindfold, placed one wrist over the 

other, and wrapped the scarf a few times around both of them.&nbsp; I then felt her tie a double knot, pulling it snug, 

not so much to cut off the circulation but clearly tight enough that I could not get them out.



�Good, now do me one more favor and go get the camera again.�



I heard Laura walk to the counter and then back again and as she came into view I saw she had the camera in 

hand.



�Thank you, my dear, but I think there�s one more thing we need.&nbsp; Please bring my panties over here.�



Laura now walked back to the chair in which she had been sitting, and I realized that she had left the panties on 

the floor next to it.&nbsp; She bent over, giving me a nice view of her tight ass encased in her snug pants.&nbsp; Once again, 

my mind flashed back to what she had been doing to Susan in the toilet stall when I was spying on them.



She brought the panties back to us and stood there waiting for her instructions.&nbsp; Susan looked at her, then back 

at me.&nbsp; She seemed to be thinking for a second, and then a smile crossed her face.



�Put them around his neck, love,� she said with a flourish.



�Pardon me, Professor Bascom?� Laura replied.



�You heard what I said, Laura.&nbsp; Put them around his neck.�&nbsp; As Laura comprehended the command, a little 

smile crossed her face also.&nbsp; She took the panties, opening them up and stretching them enough to get one of the 

leg holes and then the waist over my head.&nbsp; She drew it down, and let them rest around my neck as if they were 

a prized necklace.&nbsp; I felt the wetness on my neck, and their odor wafted up to my nose once again.



�Thank you hon.&nbsp; Okay Bob, let�s try this again.&nbsp; Now lean forward and I want you to continue what you began 

before,� Susan instructed.



I did as I was told, though it was a bit awkward without the use of my hands to brace myself.&nbsp; As my head 

approached her crotch, the angle forced my face even more tightly then before against her pussy.&nbsp; I was greeted 

again by her scent and wetness, neither of which had abated much in the few moments since I had last been in 

this proximity to her.&nbsp; As I began once again to lick, this time unconstrained by her panties, I heard her say to 

Laura, �Get a picture of this, will you hon?�



I knew enough not to protest, as it would do no good.&nbsp; I was resigned to the situation and knew I had no option.&nbsp; 

I had to trust that she would follow through on her word, that nobody else would ever find out about this.



�Pick your head up a bit and turn to Laura for a second please Bob,� Susan instructed.&nbsp; I tried to push back, but 

given the angle I was at, it was a difficult proposition.&nbsp; However, by pushing heavily with my thighs and ankles, 

I was able to get my head up enough to be able to rest it on Susan�s thigh and turn it so that I could now see 

Laura.&nbsp; �Now smile so that Laura can take a nice picture of us, will you?�&nbsp; 



This was impossible � there was no way I could force a smile in the situation.&nbsp; Susan must have realized this 

and taken pity on me, as she laughed and said to Laura, �Oh, just take the picture, Pet.&nbsp; Make sure you get both 

of our faces in the shot as well as Bob�s pretty necklace and wrist bonds.�



As I looked at Laura she picked the camera up and pointed it at us.&nbsp; Once again, I saw the lens rotate in and out 

as she operated the zoom.&nbsp; My mind flashed for a second to what the picture would look like � both of us naked 

from the waist down, me with my pants and boxers at my ankles, Susan with her suit skirt bunched up at her 

waist and her large breasts encased in her red silk bra.&nbsp; And all topped off by her sodden panties around my 

neck and her scarf on my wrists.&nbsp; All I could think about was how I�d gotten myself in this situation and what 

anybody � including my colleagues, my students, and even Sarah � would think if they viewed the picture!



I blinked as the bright flash of the camera filled the room, and Susan said, �Thank you dear.&nbsp; Please come over 

and sit next to me.&nbsp; And you Bob, can get back to work.�



I rolled my head back off of her thigh, leaned in again to her crotch, and began licking.&nbsp; At this point, with all 

that had transpired, I wanted nothing other than to get her off and get this over with.&nbsp; Any initial titillation and 

pleasure I had received in being dominated by her was now being replaced by fear and trepidation of what could 

happen to me if this ever got out.



I again sucked on her pussy lips, first one, then the other, and then began running my tongue over each.&nbsp; I could 

feel her body begin to respond again and I could hear her breathing getting heavy.&nbsp; I began to feel like I could 

see the end of this whole ordeal, and Susan confirmed this by saying in a soft voice, �Very good, Bob, you�re 

doing just fine.�&nbsp; I felt Susan�s hands on the back of my head, pulling my face even tighter into her crotch.



I turned my attention to her clit, lightly running my tongue around it.&nbsp; I knew that most women didn�t like it too 

hard there at first, but preferred the pressure to be built up as they became more and more aroused.&nbsp; As I did 

this, I could feel her secretions begin running down my face as she got wetter and wetter.



Once again, I heard Susan speak in a soft voice.&nbsp; �Laura, be a dear and help me out.�&nbsp; I couldn�t see what she 

was doing, but felt the top of her body lean forward a bit.&nbsp; She removed her hands from the back of my head and 

I thought perhaps I was going to get a brief reprieve from the intense pressure of my face against her pussy.



As I continued my attention to her clit, I felt Laura moving a bit next to us on the couch.&nbsp; I heard the rustling of 

fabric and felt something fall next to me on the floor.&nbsp; I could not see what it was, but I then heard Susan say, 

�Ah, that�s much better.&nbsp; Always nice to set the girls free,� and she giggled like a school girl.&nbsp; I realized that she 

must have removed her hands from my head only to allow Laura to take her blouse and bra off and slip the 

shoulder straps off of her arms.



�You know what to do now, don�t you Pet?� Susan said.&nbsp; At first I didn�t know if she was talking to me or to 

Laura, but then I heard Laura reply, �Yes, ma�am.�



�Would you like a little break, Bob?&nbsp; I bet your neck must be getting sore.�&nbsp; I was happy to take a little break, so 

I nodded my head up and down a bit.&nbsp; �Okay, sit back again.�



Once again I used my thighs and ankles to push myself back on my haunches.&nbsp; As I did, I saw that what I had 

suspected Laura had done to Susan was true.&nbsp; Susan�s blouse and bra were now totally removed, leaving her 

naked from the waist up, and Laura must also have pulled her skirt up over her head.&nbsp; Her breasts were just 

magnificent; they were quite large (I�ve learned not to try to guess a woman�s cup size), befitting her overall 

voluptuous body.&nbsp; They were topped with areolas the size of half dollars, a mocha brown in color, and perfectly 

smooth, no bumps in them at all.&nbsp; In the center of each were the nipples that I had seen just a few moments ago 

trying to push their way through the silk bra.&nbsp; They were fully erect, or at least what I expected were fully erect, 

and they were just lovely, the kind that you couldn�t wait to get your lips on.



Susan lay back against the couch with what appeared to be a self-satisfying grin on her face.&nbsp; She was clearly a 

woman who knew she had a certain allure to men and women alike.&nbsp; She was by no means model beautiful, and 

was much more Rubenesque than most people�s standard definition of the perfect female body.&nbsp; But for a 

woman of close to 50, she was just magnificent.&nbsp; Yes, she carried quite a few pounds, but her large frame held it 

well.&nbsp; Her skin was magnificent, with no folds, wrinkles, or stretch marks. It was an alabaster white and looked 

to be creamy smooth.&nbsp; And her body type was exactly that to which I was attracted.



My admiration of this goddess was interrupted once again by her voice.&nbsp; �You just take a little breather for a 

moment Bob and watch.�&nbsp; Turning to Laura, she said, �Okay, Pet, go ahead.�



Laura had obviously been in this position a number of times before.&nbsp; She turned slightly toward Susan, and bent 

her head down and gently fastened her lips upon Susan�s right nipple.&nbsp; Susan�s eyes closed and her head 

reclined on the back cushion of the couch as she enjoyed her graduate student�s oral skills.&nbsp; I watched as Laura 

lifted her lips from the nipple and began using her tongue all over the top half of the breast.&nbsp; She licked as if it 

were a large ice cream cone, flattening her tongue to maximize its surface contact with Susan�s breast.



As I watched this unfold, I began to think less about my own predicament and focused more on the eroticism of 

the action.&nbsp; Here was a young, impressionable graduate student, whose career was almost entirely dependent 

upon her mentor, Professor Bascom, worshipping her large breast as if it were the most beautiful thing she 

could do.&nbsp; And Susan Bascom just lay there, enjoying all the attention, seemingly oblivious at that point to my 

voyeurism of what was unfolding.



After licking all over the top of the breast, Laura took both her hands and gently lifted the orb away from 

Susan�s body.&nbsp; This exposed its underside, and in a very tender fashion, Laura began licking the spot where the 

breast was attached to her body.&nbsp; She ran her tongue in a circular mode, all the way around the outside of the 

breast, slowly working her way inward toward the nipple.&nbsp; When she got to the nipple, she released the breast to 

flop back down to Susan�s body, and began to lightly flick at the nipple.&nbsp; Much to my surprise, it grew even a 

bit more, becoming even larger than I had seen before.



Susan began to groan, as she was clearly one of those women who had very sensitive nipples and whose arousal 

was connected to their stimulation.&nbsp; After flicking the nipple for a few seconds, Laura reattached her lips to it 

and began to suck on it, eliciting even more groans from Susan.



After a few more moments of this, she shifted her body over Susan�s in order to gain access to her left breast, 

where it began to receive the same attention that its partner had.&nbsp; As she did this, Susan reached out with her 

right hand and began to rub Laura�s ass over her slacks, running her hand over each of the cheeks in wide 

circles.&nbsp; After a few minutes, as Laura continued sucking her left nipple, I saw her left hand reach underneath 

Laura�s body, and then I heard the click of a snap being undone.



Susan said quietly, �Now that�s better,� and I saw her right hand go underneath the loosened slacks to now rub 

the skin on her ass directly.&nbsp; She continued the same motion she had started on the outside of the pants, this time 

alternating the rubs with deep kneading of her ass cheeks.



All of this activity must have had an effect on Laura, because I could see her nipples beginning to appear 

beneath her light sweater.&nbsp; Her breasts were small, especially in comparison to Susan�s massive orbs, but there 

was no mistaking the way her body was reacting to the attention her ass was receiving from Susan.



A few more minutes, and then Susan spoke again: �Lift up a second, my Pet.�&nbsp; As Laura lifted her body 

slightly, Susan lifted her head up and opened her eyes, gazing into mine.&nbsp; Again, a smile came across her face as 

she looked at me, with my erect cock bobbing in my lap as I sat on my ankles.



She took both her hands and used them to ease Laura�s pants down her narrow hips, followed by her panties.&nbsp; 

Unlike Susan�s, Laura�s panties were a much more utilitarian black cotton.&nbsp; Like mine, the slacks and panties 

were left bunched at Laura�s ankles.&nbsp; I looked at Laura�s body � she had a small ass, almost boyish, much 

different than the well-rounded backside of her mentor.



Susan then grabbed the bottom of Laura�s sweater and lifted it up over her arms and head.&nbsp; I was not surprised 

to see that she wore no bra, as she was so slight in build that she didn�t appear to need one.&nbsp; It also explained 

why it was so easy to see her nipples through her sweater as she had become more aroused.



�Okay, Pet, back to work.�&nbsp; Laura bent down again and continued her attention to Susan�s left nipple.&nbsp; Susan 

kept looking at me with that sly smile on her face.&nbsp; She reached down with her right hand and began once again 

to rub Laura�s ass, this time unencumbered by her slacks.&nbsp; She rubbed lightly at first, and then began to gently 

knead the cheeks, one at a time.&nbsp; I thought I heard a moan escape Laura�s mouth, which would not have 

surprised me given what was happening, but it was hard to tell since her mouth was still affixed to Susan�s 

nipple.



After alternating rubbing and kneading of Laura�s ass, Susan began to lightly drag her finger over her crack.&nbsp; 

She dragged it up and down, from the top of the crack, where you could first see its beginning, all the way down 

toward her pussy but out of my view.&nbsp; The entire time, Susan smiled and never took her eyes off of mine, as I 

watched what she was doing to Laura. 



After about the fifth or sixth trip down Laura�s crack with her finger, she began to increase the pressure and she 

appeared to be going deeper and deeper down the crack.&nbsp; Finally, on one trip, I heard Laura pick up her head 

from Susan�s breast and gasp loudly.&nbsp; Susan then lifted her hand, showing me her finger, which was now quite 

wet with what must have been Laura�s secretions.&nbsp; Without taking her eyes off of me, she took the finger and 

put it in her mouth, licking it clean, showing me her tongue as she did so.



This had quite an effect on me, as my cock stood even further to attention.&nbsp; It was such an erotic site, this petite, 

young woman, draped across the voluptuous senior professor, who had just finished tasting the young student�s 

wetness.&nbsp; I couldn�t help but be aroused, and Susan didn�t miss the reaction that she was having on me.



�I thought you would enjoy this, Bob,� she said with a smile.&nbsp; �Hard not to react to it, isn�t it?�



I didn�t answer, but just gulped.&nbsp; But Susan pressed me this time:&nbsp; �I said, hard not to react, isn�t it?�



I now realized she wanted a response, so I said, �Yes, Professor Bascom, it is difficult not to react to what I�m 

seeing.�



�And why is that Bob?&nbsp; Tell me what about it you like.�



I wasn�t sure what to say, so I figured I was so deep into this whole situation that I might as well tell the truth. 

�It�s just very erotic, watching what you�re doing to your student, and what she�s doing to you.�



�More specific, Bob,� she said sternly.



I sighed and thought for a few seconds.&nbsp; �I�m enjoying see her sucking on your nipple and you touching her 

ass,� I said in a soft voice.



She looked at me questioningly, as if I had forgotten something.&nbsp; I realized immediately what I had forgotten, 

and added quickly, �Professor Bascom.�



�So, you like the attention I�m paying to her ass, then?�



I could do nothing other than to answer truthfully, �Yes, ma�am.�



�Ah, I didn�t realize that you had an anal fetish, Bob.&nbsp; That�s a good thing to know about you � I�ll just have to 

file that away for future reference,� she chuckled.



I was about to ask what she meant by �future reference,� but decided it would be better to not say a word at that 

point.



�Well, you�ll be pleased to know then that Laura likes a little anal attention every now and then, don�t you, 

Pet?�



Laura quietly responded, �Yes, ma�am.�



�Yes, ma�am, what, Laura?� Susan responded.



Laura glanced over at me with a look of total humiliation on her face.&nbsp; I got the strong sense that she had been 

in this position before.&nbsp; She too knew she was trapped and had no out other than to be truthful. She turned back 

to look up at Susan and said, �I like having you pay attention to my ass, Professor Bascom.�



�Oh, please, Pet, I know you can do better than that.�



I saw a tear forming in Laura�s eye as she said in a very quiet voice, just barely audible, �I like lying across you 

and letting you play with my ass, ma�am.�&nbsp; The tear rolled down her cheek, followed by several more.



Seeing the effect she was having on Laura, I decided that things had gone too far.&nbsp; It was one thing for Susan to 

take advantage of me; after all, she had caught me spying on her in the women�s room.&nbsp; But the psychological 

and sexual dominance of this poor graduate student, whose career was dependent upon Susan, seemed 

unreasonably cruel.



�Okay, Susan, that�s enough � leave her alone,� I said in a firm voice.



�What did you say, Bob?� she replied with a tone of incredulity, staring into my eyes.



�I said leave her alone � what you�re doing to her is wrong, using your authority to take advantage of a student 

like that,� I said, this time though in a more normal tone of voice.



Susan stared back at me for a moment, and Laura too looked at me.&nbsp; I think this show of defiance surprised her 

as much as it surprised Susan.



Susan said to me in a very calm voice, �So now you want to stand up and challenge me, Bob?&nbsp; Over this?�



�Yes,� I replied.



�Well, that�s very gallant of you, Professor Arnold, but the fact is that you�re not in any situation to tell me what 

to do now, are you?�&nbsp; She stared at me even harder, like she were trying to bore a hole through my head.



�Look at you � you have your trousers and boxers down at your ankles, you�re wearing my soaked panties 

around your neck, your wrists are bound behind your back.&nbsp; And I�ve got the photographic evidence that you 

were spying on us here in the bathroom.�&nbsp; She let out a hearty laugh, the loudest one yet, so loud that I was 

afraid that somebody outside in the corridor would hear her.



As she continued to chuckle, she said, �No, Bob, I don�t think you�re in any position to tell me what to do.�



I started to reply, �Look Susan, just let her. . . .�&nbsp; But before I could get the sentence out, her laughter stopped 

and she barked at me, �Shut up Bob, before I take those panties and stuff them into your mouth to shut you up.�



The ferocity of her response caught me by surprise.&nbsp; I knew she was right, that there was nothing I could do to 

stop her.&nbsp; Once again, I realized I was defeated, and I just stared back at her.



She stared back at me, fully confident in her knowledge that she had won this battle too.&nbsp; After a few more 

moments, she took her eyes off of me, turned again to Laura, and said, �Now where were we, Pet, before Bob 

so rudely interrupted us?�



Laura hesitated, unable to get the words out again admitting her submission to the dominant professor.&nbsp; Susan 

waited, seemingly until Laura would say again that she liked to have Susan play with her ass.&nbsp; But after a few 

more moments of silence, Susan must have taken pity on her.



�Oh yes, I remember now, you were telling us how you liked me to play with your ass.&nbsp; Shall I show Professor 

Arnold what you like?�



�If you wish, ma�am,� Laura replied, no longer crying but still appearing quite humiliated.



Susan chuckled again and said, �Oh yes, Laura, I do wish.&nbsp; Come lie across me, sweetie, so I have better 

access.�&nbsp; Laura shifted her body up, laying it across Susan�s thighs.



With that Susan took her right hand and again ran it down Laura�s crack.&nbsp; I could see from the angle of her wrist 

that she plunged a finger into her pussy again, and then pulled it back up.&nbsp; As before, she displayed Laura�s 

wetness running down her finger.&nbsp; This time, though, instead of licking her finger, she ran it from the top of 

Laura�s crack to her rosebud, and then quickly wormed it into Laura�s ass.



Once again, a gasp emanated from Laura�s mouth, even louder than the last one.&nbsp; Susan began to gently plunge 

the finger in and out of Laura�s ass.&nbsp; I could see what this was doing to Laura as she started breathing more 

heavily, her small chest rising up and down across Susan�s body.&nbsp; Susan looked down at her, and with her left 

hand, she began stroking Laura�s hair, saying to her in almost a whisper, �That�s right, you take my finger up 

your ass like a good girl.�



The more Susan pushed her finger into her, the more aroused Laura seemed to get.&nbsp; She began to grind her 

pelvis against Susan�s thighs, trying desperately to get some attention to her pussy.&nbsp; As Susan continued to 

piston her finger in and out of Laura�s ass with one hand and stroke her hair with the other, she picked her head 

up to look at me, and with a smile, said, �You see Bob, I know what she likes.&nbsp; She just loves for me to play 

with her like this.&nbsp; She may appear not to want it, but I know the truth, don�t I Pet?�



Laura, still rubbing against Susan�s thighs, managed to eke out a barely audible, �Yes, ma�am.�



�What is it you want, Pet?�



�Please, Professor Bascom, I need to cum.�



�Oh, you�d like that, Pet, wouldn�t you?&nbsp; First, you get on your knees and lick me in a toilet stall, then you lie 

here like the little slut that you are, just wiggling in my lap as I put my finger up your ass.&nbsp; And with Professor 

Arnold watching the whole thing.&nbsp; And you want to cum?�



�Yes, please Mistress, I need badly to cum.�



That was the first time I had heard Laura utter the word �Mistress,� and the realization that she had used that 

word gave me insight to their relationship.&nbsp; Clearly what had happened between them tonight was nothing new; 

I now realized their relationship of dominance and submission must have been going on for some time now.



Susan removed her finger from Laura�s ass with a �pop� and looked at me.&nbsp; �What do you think, Bob?&nbsp; Should I 

let my little Pet cum, or should I leave her all hot and bothered?&nbsp; Because, you know, she�s not allowed to have 

an orgasm without my permission, so if I stop now she�ll be left unsatisfied.�



I didn�t want to play this game, putting the young woman�s fate in my hands.&nbsp; I simply shrugged and said, �Do 

whatever you want, Susan � you�re going to do so anyway, so what difference does it make what I say?�



Susan frowned a bit and said, �Oh Bob, I�m so disappointed.&nbsp; You know I value your professional opinion as a 

colleague.&nbsp; We�re both successful professors � well, truth be told, we both know that I�ve had a lot more success 

than you have � so why wouldn�t I want to have you weigh in on this?�



Her throwing her achievements in my face stung.&nbsp; She must have known that there had always been a little 

professional jealousy of her on my part, and she was using that to add to my humiliation.&nbsp; But I refused to play 

along with this little game, and replied, �Sorry, Susan, but this isn�t my area of expertise � you�re on your own 

here.�



She at first looked perturbed at my unwillingness to play along, and I momentarily fretted that I had made her 

even more cross with me.&nbsp; But then she simply laughed and turned back to Laura, telling her, �Don�t you fret, 

my sweet Pet, I�ll take care of you.&nbsp; Don�t I always?�&nbsp; 



Laura looked up at her with a look of adoration in her eyes and said, �Yes, ma�am, you do.�



�That�s right, I do, and I promise you I will.&nbsp; But not quite yet � we�ve got something else to do first.&nbsp; Sit up 

here, hon.�&nbsp; Laura lifted herself off of Susan�s thighs, and sat next to her on the couch, her slacks and panties 

still at her ankles.&nbsp; 



Turning to me, she said, �Bob, get back here and continue where you left off,� opening up her thighs once 

again.&nbsp; I sighed, and leaned forward to return myself to my previous position with my head pressed against her 

pussy.



She was just as wet as she was before, even though it had been a while since I had been licking her.&nbsp; Her 

dominance of Laura clearly turned her on, and her body showed that.&nbsp; As I began licking, I heard her say to 

Laura, �Go over and untie his hands, Pet.�



I felt Laura lifting off the couch, then felt her fingers on my wrists as she undid the knot.&nbsp; I brought my hands 

back to my side and prepared to rest them once again on the couch to brace myself and provide more support, 

but Susan said, �No Bob, leave them by your side, you�re going to need them.�&nbsp; I did as she commanded, and I 

once again felt Laura sitting on the couch next to her.



I was working on Susan�s plump labia again, running my tongue over them, when I heard her say, �Spread your 

legs out honey.�&nbsp; She must have complied, because Susan then said, �See Bob, I told you I�d take care of her.&nbsp; 

I�m sitting here fingering her sweet young pussy while you work on me.�



I of course couldn�t see what she was doing, but could picture what it must have looked like, with Susan�s 

finger or fingers pistoning out of Laura�s pussy now, rather than her ass.&nbsp; It was an image that I liked 

envisioning, and could only wish that I was watching exactly what she was doing.



�But there�s one thing missing, isn�t there Bob?� Susan said.&nbsp; I had no idea what the hell she was talking about, 

so I sort of grunted and continued licking up and down her slit.



�That�s right, what�s missing is your orgasm, isn�t it?&nbsp; I wouldn�t want you to feel left out now, would I?&nbsp; I want 

to be fair � with all this pussy licking you�ve been doing, which I know you love, plus your watching of me 

playing with my little Pet here, you must be badly in need of cumming yourself.�



I didn�t want to admit it, but she was right.&nbsp; I had been aroused for quite some time, and even given the perverse 

circumstances in which I found myself, the release that an orgasm would bring would be very welcome.



�So let me help you out, Bob.&nbsp; Sit up for a second.�&nbsp; I pushed myself back once again, and could now see Laura 

sitting next to her with her legs splayed and Susan�s middle three fingers on her right hand in Laura�s pussy.&nbsp; 

She removed them, and leaned forward and grabbed hold of my erect cock.&nbsp; She rubbed her hand around it a 

couple of times, and I thought she was going to jerk me off like that.&nbsp; The idea of her doing that � jerking me off 

like a young school boy � while this graduate student watched was mortifying.&nbsp; But after what must have been 

an hour of arousal (I had lost track of the time at this point), my cock responded positively to her touch.



But just as she was getting started, she stopped.&nbsp; She leaned back on the sofa again and placed her fingers back 

into Laura�s pussy, squishing them around.&nbsp; She looked back at me and said with a smirk, �Okay, Bob get your 

face back in there and start jerking yourself.�



The realization of what she was telling me to do stung me like a slap across the face.&nbsp; �What,� I shouted, �I 

can�t do that.�



�Oh yes, Bob, you not only can but you will,� she replied calmly.&nbsp; �Now get started.�



I stared at her, tempted to just get up, get my clothes on, and stomp out leaving Susan and her little plaything 

there on the couch.&nbsp; But as quickly as the idea came into my head, it exited.&nbsp; I knew I couldn�t do that because 

of the fear of what she�d do in return.&nbsp; I just continued to stare at her, until she cocked the index finger of her 

left hand and began beckoning to me in a �come here� sign.&nbsp; Defeated, I knew that I had no choice, and I bent 

forward and resumed licking her.



�That�s right Bob, keep going, because you�re going to stay right there where you are until I see you cum.&nbsp; But 

you better be good, because you need to make sure that both Laura and I cum first.&nbsp; If not, there�s going to be 

hell to pay.&nbsp; So start spanking the ol� monkey,� she said with a laugh.



Utterly shamed, I did what I was told by this domineering colleague.&nbsp; I resumed licking her, pushing my tongue 

deep into her pussy, as I began to run my hand up and down my shaft.&nbsp; Laura�s pussy secretions had lubricated 

it enough that my hand ran easily up and down with little resistance.&nbsp; As I was doing this, I could hear the 

squishing of Laura�s pussy as Susan must have been pistoning her fingers even more vigorously in and out.



After a few more minutes of this I could feel that I was getting close to an orgasm.&nbsp; I sensed that Susan was 

close too, based on the heavy breathing I could feel and the fact that her thighs were clamping my head more 

and more strongly.&nbsp; I had no idea how close Laura was though, so I was trying my best to hold back on my own 

orgasm.&nbsp; I lightened my stroke, but Susan caught me, saying, �No, Bob, don�t let up, keep touching yourself.�



I complied, and after a few more moments I heard Laura go, �Please, let me cum, let me cum, Mistress.�&nbsp; 



Susan replied, �Go ahead, Pet, go ahead and cum for your Mistress,� and not more than 5 seconds later I&nbsp; heard 

Laura scream out, �Ahhhhhhhhhhhhh, gawwwwwwwd.�&nbsp; Again, I was terrified that somebody in the corridor 

could hear us, but I took some solace in the knowledge that at least the door was locked.



I knew I was close and could only hope that Susan was also.&nbsp; I turned my attention to her clit and began 

working it with a vengeance.&nbsp; By now I knew that she was aroused enough that I could lick it and suck it hard to 

bring her to an orgasm.&nbsp; And sure enough, after about a minute of this, I could feel her cumming.&nbsp; She clamped 

down hard on my head between her thighs, and her pussy spasmed as she let out an �Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.�



And then a gush of fluid soaked my face as she came and squirted all over me.&nbsp; I lightened up on her clit as she 

came down, but continued stroking myself as I knew that I too was past the point of no return.&nbsp; Just a few 

seconds later, I came myself, squirting cum all over the carpeting of the bathroom.&nbsp; Susan�s thighs opened, 

releasing me finally from her crotch.&nbsp; I sat back, her pussy juice dripping off of my face, underneath her panties 

and on to my shirt, my cum pooled in front of me.



I looked over at Laura, who was still lying back against the couch with her legs splayed out.&nbsp; She too had a 

small pool of liquid between her legs on the fabric of the couch.



Susan opened her eyes and looked at me.&nbsp; �Very good, Professor Arnold.&nbsp; I�d give that performance a very high 

rating,� she said with a smirk.&nbsp; �I think he�s fulfilled his obligations, don�t you, Pet?� she asked turning to 

Laura.



Laura smiled slightly and said, �Yes, ma�am.�



I stared at Susan and said, �Is that it?&nbsp; Is your little game over now?&nbsp; I did everything I asked, so are you going 

to fulfill your end of the bargain and promise not to say or show anything to anybody?�



Susan just looked back at me for a few seconds, seemingly thinking about something.&nbsp; �Yes, Bob, you did do 

everything I�ve asked.&nbsp; You can get up and get dressed.&nbsp; You too Laura.�



I got up and tried my best to put myself back together.&nbsp; I fixed my shirt and put my sport coat back on.&nbsp; After 

pulling my pants up, I remembered I had her damn panties around my neck.&nbsp; I pulled them up off my head and 

reached out to hand them to her as she was dropping her suit skirt back down her legs.&nbsp; She had already put her 

bra and blouse on.



She looked at my hand and her panties, then looked me in the eyes.&nbsp; �Oh, Bob, you can keep those as a souvenir 

for now.�



�I don�t want a souvenir of this, Susan,� I said coldly back to her.



�Oh yes you do,� she replied with a smile, �you just don�t know it yet.�



�What do you mean, �yet�?� I asked her.



�Well, we still have a few days left in this conference, don�t we.&nbsp; I don�t need them now but may in a day or 

two, so I think I�ll have you return them to me later.&nbsp; I�ll let you know when I want to see you again to get them 

back.�



I was dumbfounded.&nbsp; I watched as she and Laura walked over to the vanity and began fixing their hair and 

make-up.



�And Bob � don�t think about leaving early.&nbsp; I know you have a paper to give on the last day of the conference, 

so I�ll expect you to be here the whole time.�



With that, the two of them grabbed their purses, walked to the door, unlocked it, and left.

I suggest you read the earlier chapters of this story first



*************



I woke up the next morning after a fitful night of sleep.&nbsp; I at least had remembered to set the 

alarm, which was an amazing accomplishment considering the mental state I was in.&nbsp; I had a 

paper to give that day, so couldn�t just sleep in and sleep off what had happened.



I dragged my body out of bed and headed for the shower.&nbsp; The hotel room had one of those large 

bathrooms with both a tub and a separate stall shower, and I opted for the latter.&nbsp; Even though I 

had just taken a shower the night before, I decided that I needed another to jumpstart my day.&nbsp; 

After the water heated up, I hopped in and let the hot jets stream all over my body.&nbsp; As I did this, 

the events of the last evening began running through my head all over again.&nbsp; I shook my head as 

my encounter with Professor Susan Bascom came back to my consciousness.



*************



After Susan and her graduate student, Laura, left the bathroom, I just stood there for a minute or 

two stunned and unable to move.&nbsp; I couldn�t believe I had managed to get myself in that position, 

of having been caught spying on them in the women�s room of the hotel.&nbsp; Susan proceeded to 

blackmail me into servicing her sexually right there in the bathroom, threatening to expose me if 

I didn�t do what she had said.



Finally, after a minute or two, I walked over to the sinks and cleaned myself up as best I could.&nbsp; I 

splashed cold water on my face and front of my hair, and wiped it off with a paper towel.&nbsp; I 

looked in the mirror and realized I still looked ragged, but decided I was presentable enough that 

I could pass if I managed to bump into anybody after I left the bathroom.&nbsp; I was planning on 

going right up to my room but wanted to be prepared just in case.



I walked over to the door and when I got there I realized that it was now unlocked, Susan and 

Laura having exited a couple of minutes earlier.&nbsp; I opened the door just a crack to peek out and 

make sure nobody was in the small corridor leading to the bathrooms.&nbsp; I didn�t see anybody, so I 

quickly opened the door wide enough to pop out.&nbsp; The door to the men�s room was right nearby, 

so I knew I was now safe once the door to the women�s room closed behind me.&nbsp; As I started 

walking back toward the lobby of the hotel, it dawned on me that the �Out of Service� sign that 

had been placed in front of the bathroom by the hotel employee was no longer there.&nbsp; �Damn,� I 

muttered to myself.&nbsp; I realized that Susan must have moved it when she and Laura left the 

bathroom, leaving me exposed to anybody who could have walked in.&nbsp; I just shook my head and 

continued toward the elevators.



As I approached the elevators, I glanced to make sure Susan and Laura were not still there.&nbsp; The 

didn�t want to have to ride the elevator with them, Susan assuredly smirking at me the whole 

way.&nbsp; They were already gone, so I pushed the button and waited.&nbsp; I looked at my watch; it was 

about 10:30, meaning that I must have been in that bathroom with them for about an hour.&nbsp; 



An elevator quickly arrived, which I was thankful for, because the last thing I wanted to do 

besides bumping into Susan and Laura was to run into anybody else from the conference.&nbsp; I 

entered and pushed the button for my floor, and as the elevator ascended, I reached in my pocket 

to get my key.&nbsp; As I did, I felt the soft, wet silk of Susan�s red panties in there, which caused me 

to think about Susan�s parting words: �I�ll let you know when I want to see you again to get 

them back.�



I had no idea what she meant by that, but I was afraid that she was going to go back on her word.&nbsp; 

She had told me that if I had done everything she told me to, that neither she nor Laura would 

ever say anything to anybody about what had happened in that bathroom.&nbsp; Yet she told me to 

hold on to her panties and that she would get them from me later during the conference, a 

directive that caused me to think she had more things up her sleeve.



The elevator doors opened at my floor, and I exited and turned right toward my room.&nbsp; I glanced 

quickly over my shoulder to make sure that neither Susan nor Laura were at the other end of the 

hall, where their rooms were.&nbsp; With a sense of relief, I saw nobody else in the hall, and continued 

on down to my room and went inside.&nbsp; I quickly stripped off my clothes, emptying the pockets of 

my pants on the dresser.&nbsp; Susan�s panties landed unceremoniously on top of my change, cell 

phone, and a roll of Life Savers.&nbsp; I stared at them for a second, then quickly grabbed them and 

threw them into the drawer of the dresser where I kept my own underwear.&nbsp; I buried them under 

my own boxers and socks.



I hopped into the shower in order to try to cleanse from my body, if not my mind, the memory of 

what had happened to me.&nbsp; I was both ashamed and confused; on the one hand, I was humiliated 

by getting caught by Susan and by what she had made me do.&nbsp; On the other, I had to recognize 

that I also had been incredibly turned on by the exercise.&nbsp; The fact that I had been aroused by 

being dominated by Susan didn�t totally surprise me.&nbsp; My wife Sarah and I had played some role 

playing games before, some of which involved dominance and submission.&nbsp; But those had only 

been games, and had been with my own wife.&nbsp; So the fact that I was so aroused as I was 

dominated and humiliated by Susan � and in front of her graduate student � was somewhat 

troubling to me.



I finished showering, dried off, brushed my teeth, and walked back into the room.&nbsp; I then did 

something I almost never did � I went into the minibar in my room and grabbed a nip of scotch.&nbsp; 

I threw some clothes on and went down the hall to fill up my ice bucket.&nbsp; When I returned, a put 

a few cubes in a glass and poured the scotch over it.&nbsp; I downed the scotch in about three gulps, 

almost causing me to choke as it went down.&nbsp; At that point I figured a little self-medication 

would help me sleep.



I got into bed and tossed and turned for a while, the activities of the evening running through my 

head.&nbsp; After what must have been an hour of this, I finally fell asleep.



*************



Back in the shower the next morning, all I could think of was what Susan�s intent was in leaving 

her panties with me.&nbsp; I wasn�t sure whether she was just trying to tease me and make me nervous 

about what she might do, or whether she intended to continue what she had started in the 

women�s room last night.&nbsp; In either event, I knew that I had few options other than to play along, 

because she had enough evidence that she could use to do great damage to me.



After the shower, I got dressed, putting on some respectable academic clothes for my paper 

session.&nbsp; I grabbed the stuff I needed and shoved it into my backpack and walked out the door.&nbsp; 

What I desperately needed was a cup of coffee and some sugar to cram into my mouth.&nbsp; 



As I was closing the door, I remembered what Susan had said about telling me when she wanted 

her panties back.&nbsp; I had no clue when she was going to want them, but I decided the safest thing 

was to have them with me at all times.&nbsp; So I headed back into the room and found them where I 

had left them last night in the bottom of the drawer.&nbsp; As I picked them up, I realized that they 

were no longer wet, having dried overnight.&nbsp; I quickly sniffed them, partly out of curiosity and 

party from the memory of what I had done last night.&nbsp; They still smelled quite ripe, the memories 

of my subservience to Susan rushing once again into my brain.&nbsp; I quickly put them into one of 

the pockets of my pack and headed out once again.



I exited the elevator in the lobby and found my way to the ubiquitous Starbucks kiosk.&nbsp; Even 

though it was a small conference, there was still quite a line of fellow academics looking for that 

caffeine fix they so needed to make it through a day�s worth of mind-numbing and tedious 

discussions of English � or more precisely, British � literature.



As I waited for the slow line to progress, I glanced around the lobby trying to see if Susan was 

anywhere in sight.&nbsp; I knew that I couldn�t avoid her for the rest of the conference over the next 

few days, but I was going to work damn hard to minimize how many times I did have to see her.&nbsp; 

I breathed a quiet sigh of relief, as she didn�t appear to be anywhere nearby.



After about five or six minutes, it was finally my turn to give my order to the Starbucks barista.&nbsp; 

The young woman must have been about 19 or 20, probably a college student earning a few extra 

dollars working here at the hotel.&nbsp; She was cute as a button, so I smiled at her and gave her my 

order, doing my flirting-with-the-young-college-student act that I enjoyed so much (and I hoped 

they enjoyed as well).&nbsp; As she smiled back and handed me my change, her hand grazed mine, 

and a little shiver ran down my spine.&nbsp; But I quickly realized there was probably no meaning 

behind it, and I mumbled a �thank you,� and went to the other end of the counter to pick up my 

large � excuse me, �Grande� � coffee and cinnamon roll.



I looked at my watch and realized I&nbsp; had just a few minutes to get to the meeting room where the 

first session I was going to attend was to be held.&nbsp; It wasn�t the session where I had to give my 

paper, but nevertheless, I hated to walk in late to these things.&nbsp; As I turned away from the counter 

to head toward the meeting room, I bumped right into somebody walking by.&nbsp; I somehow 

managed to hold on to my coffee and roll, and only spilled a few drops through the sipping hole 

and onto the floor.&nbsp; As I recovered, I looked up at who the klutz was who almost ran me down, 

and I almost dropped the coffee and roll again when I realized it was Laura, Susan�s graduate 

student.



She was gathering up a folder that she dropped, and when she arose again and looked at me, I 

saw that she was about as horrified to bump into me as I was to see her.&nbsp; She said, �I�m sorry, 

Professor Arnold,� and quickly ran off before I could say anything in return.&nbsp; I turned and looked 

back at the people in the coffee queue who witnessed the run-in, and they all had an amused look 

on their face.&nbsp; They probably thought it was the typical terrified grad student, afraid that she had 

spilled coffee on a senior professor, and that she had just ruined her chances of ever landing a 

job.&nbsp; All I could think was, �If they only knew the truth.�



I managed to make it to the meeting room without further incident.&nbsp; I entered, and found a seat 

on an aisle, not too far from the back.&nbsp; I found that these early morning sessions were usually 

lackluster, so I liked to position myself for a quick exit.&nbsp; I sat through the three papers, one of 

which was pretty bad, the other two at least interesting enough that I chose to stick around.&nbsp; The 

discussant�s comments were, as usual, condescending and totally unhelpful, but the grad students 

giving their papers nodded seriously and graciously and thanked the pompous fool for his 

insightful (in their words) comments.



I felt sort of badly for one of the students, to whom the discussant had been particularly mean, so 

when the question and answer period opened up, I threw her a softball question.&nbsp; I started with 

my interpretation of what she had to say, then asked her if she agreed.&nbsp; She answered 

affirmatively, then elaborated a bit more on what she had written in the paper.&nbsp; When she 

finished, I smiled at her and said, �Thank you.�



The moderator asked if there were other questions.&nbsp; I heard a clear, strong voice directly behind 

me say, �I beg to differ with Professor Arnold, but I have a slightly different take on your 

interpretation.�&nbsp; I didn�t have to turn around to know who it was � I immediately recognized 

Susan Bascom�s voice.&nbsp; I hadn�t seen her there when I came in so she must have entered the 

room after I did.&nbsp; I wanted to ignore her, but realized that would be so obvious to the 20 or so 

others in the room, many of whom were colleagues who knew both of us.&nbsp; So I turned slightly in 

my chair to look at her, and I gave her a curt smile.&nbsp; She gave me an even broader smile back, 

then turned back toward the woman giving the paper and continued with her question.



As Susan spoke, I looked at her once again.&nbsp; She was wearing one of her signature outfits, not 

unlike what I saw her in last night � low-cut blouse showing off her ample cleavage, expensive-

looking silk scarf, and a skirt cut respectably above her knee.&nbsp; All was constructed to maximize 

the sexiness of her body.&nbsp; As I wrote earlier, she was by no means a thin woman, but she carried 

her weight quite well and she knew how to dress to look her best.&nbsp; Even though at 50 she was 

about a decade older than I was, I had to admit she still looked damn good.&nbsp; And I knew that she 

still turned heads among both the faculty and grad students at the conference.



The young woman listened to Susan�s question and then respectfully answered it.&nbsp; Susan was 

very polite back, thanking her and complimenting her.&nbsp; I had no desire to interact with her when 

the session ended, so after one more question I discreetly turned and walked to the door in the 

back of the meeting room without making eye contact with her.&nbsp; I quietly opened it, left the 

room, and went to close it behind me.&nbsp; But before I could, I felt pressure pushing back on it, and 

I knew exactly who it would be.&nbsp; Sure enough, Susan pulled the door open and exited the room, 

giving me the same broad smile she had laid on me just a few minutes ago.



After she closed the door, Susan said, �Well, Bob, what did you think of that panel?�



All I could do was just stare at her, mouth agape, totally at a loss for words.&nbsp; Was she going to 

just carry on like nothing had happened last night?



�What�s wrong, cat got your tongue?� she asked, this time in a much lower voice and with a 

clear twinkle in her eye.&nbsp; After I still did not respond, she said, �Or should I ask, pussy got your 

tongue?�&nbsp; With that, she laughed heartily and took a step closer to me, so that she was right in 

front of me.&nbsp; With her height, and her fashionable heels, she was probably an inch or two taller 

than me.&nbsp; She leaned in, and whispered in my ear, �You�ll be hearing from me, pet � you still 

have something of mine you need to return, don�t you?�&nbsp; As she said this, she reached down and 

grabbed hold of my balls through my trousers.&nbsp; I flinched and quickly looked around, terrified 

that somebody may have seen what she did.&nbsp; But I realized her body in front of mine 

camouflaged what was going on, so to anybody watching it would just appear she was 

whispering something to me.



She squeezed again, and I quickly whispered back to her, �Yes, I know.�&nbsp; She released her grip, 

smiled once again, and continued on down the hallway, leaving me in her wake.&nbsp; I just stood 

there, glued to the spot, staring at her well-curved ass as it retreated.



After a few seconds I shook my head and thought to myself, �Is this going to be what the next 

few days will be like, random encounters with Susan and Laura?�&nbsp; I had no desire for this, and 

thought for a second maybe I should just leave the conference.&nbsp; But I had my paper to give later 

today, never mind one on the last day and I was also the discussant on another panel.&nbsp; And I had 

Susan�s admonition about not leaving the conference early � I was not about to take a chance on 

inciting her wrath, not knowing exactly how far she would go with the evidence she held against 

me.&nbsp; After realizing this, I headed back toward the lobby for another round with the barista at 

Starbucks.&nbsp; Nothing like a good shot of caffeine � though I started thinking that scotch would 

taste pretty good right now � to help get you through the day.



I headed back to the lobby for a cappuccino this time (though the cute college student was gone), 

and then proceeded on to the next session.&nbsp; The papers in this one were only a slight 

improvement from the last, but at least Susan was not stalking me in this session also.&nbsp; I ran into 

a colleague from the west coast, Marnie Carney whose company I enjoyed quite a bit, so it was 

nice to see her again.&nbsp; Yes, I know, that is her real name!&nbsp; We were in grad school together, and 

she was already married when I first met her.&nbsp; For the life of me, I never understood why she 

took her husband�s name when it would result in a rhyme like that, but she did. The irony is that 

she divorced him a few years after getting her Ph.D., but since she had started her academic 

career and publishing under that name, she had little choice but to keep it.&nbsp; I had always been 

attracted to Marnie, but by the time she was divorced I was already married to Sarah.&nbsp; I still 

enjoyed spending time with her the few opportunities we had to get together at various 

conferences and meetings.



Marnie and I had lunch after that session, getting caught up on each other�s lives, the office 

gossip � the usual, who was turned down for tenure, who was hot on the job market, which of 

our colleagues were sleeping with their students, etc. (needless to say, I stayed away from the 

topic of Susan Bascom) � and I found it was a great distraction from all that had gone on in the 

last day.&nbsp; We parted with plans to have dinner the next night to continue the discussion.



My paper session was right after lunch, so I found my way to that room.&nbsp; As the session started, I 

quickly scanned the room, expecting to see Susan.&nbsp; I thought maybe she�d take the opportunity to 

try to humiliate me in public, albeit this time in a more appropriate manner.&nbsp; Somewhat to my 

surprise, and admittedly, perhaps, my disappointment, she wasn�t there.&nbsp; I managed to stumble 

through my paper without making too much of an idiot of myself.&nbsp; This discussant was a bit 

more polite than the earlier ones I had heard, though he clearly knew nothing about the subject of 

my paper (the influence of the Industrial Revolution on the development of child characters in 

the British novel in the late 19th century).&nbsp; I smiled and thanked him, which was the appropriate 

thing to do, then entertained a couple of questions from the audience.&nbsp; One or two fawning 

graduate students came up to me after the session to tell me how much they admired my work 

and just how influential it had been on their own.&nbsp; I was used to this academic bullshit � I knew 

the two of them were trying to grease the skids for when they went on the job market themselves, 

as my university was known as one of the plum places to work.&nbsp; I smiled, thanked them, and then 

made a hasty retreat.



By that time I had had enough; there is only so much time that you can sit and listen to people 

drone on about the British novel.&nbsp; So I headed back to my room.&nbsp; I knew the hotel had a pool, so 

I thought a nice late afternoon swim would be good to clear my head.&nbsp; As I exited the elevator on 

my floor, I quickly peeked to the left, not wanting to run into either Susan or Laura.&nbsp; There was 

nobody there, of course, and I realized I was being unduly paranoid.



I went on to my room, entered, and threw my backpack on the bed.&nbsp; As I started to take my 

clothes off, I noticed the red message light on the phone was blinking.&nbsp; I thought it might be 

Marnie calling to make plans for dinner the next evening, so I called the hotel�s voicemail 

system, listened to the instructions, then punched in the codes to retrieve my messages.&nbsp; Instead 

of Marnie�s voice, however, it was Susan�s I heard through the telephone handset.&nbsp; �Tomorrow 

night, pet, 6:00pm, you�ll return what you have of mine.&nbsp; Room 517.�



�Damn,� I thought, just after I had made plans with Marnie for tomorrow.&nbsp; She was leaving the 

following morning, and didn�t want to miss the opportunity to have dinner with her.&nbsp; So I picked 

up the phone and dialed Susan�s room, figuring I would get her voicemail.



�Hello,� I heard her answer, much to my surprise.&nbsp; 



I hesitated for a second, then said, �Susan, it�s Bob.�



�Oh, hi there Bob.&nbsp; You got my message, I presume?�



�Yes, I did, but I can�t make it then, I made plans. . .�&nbsp; But before I could go any further, she cut 

me off.



�6:00pm tomorrow pet, and don�t be late, or else.�&nbsp; And with that she hung up the phone.&nbsp; I stood 

there holding the handset, just staring at it, infuriated at what she was doing to me.&nbsp; I slammed it 

back on the phone, changed into my bathing suit, and stormed down to the pool to try to take out 

my frustrations in some laps.



*************



That evening and the next day went by in a blur.&nbsp; I couldn�t focus on the awards banquet that 

evening, the speeches any of the recipients made, or any of the sessions I attended the next day.&nbsp; 

All I could think about was having to deal with Susan again.&nbsp; In the back of my mind I was 

hoping that I�d go to her room, return her panties, and she�d just laugh the whole thing off.&nbsp; But I 

suspected it was not going to be that easy.



In the morning I had called and left a message in Marnie�s room, apologizing for having to 

cancel our dinner plans.&nbsp; I simply told her that something had come up, and we would get caught 

up with one another at the MLA convention.&nbsp; 



Late in the afternoon I went back to the pool for a swim, then returned to my room and showered 

and changed.&nbsp; It was about 5:30, so I figured I would go through my e-mail before I headed off to 

Susan�s room.&nbsp; I started scanning my e-mail, which contained the usual combination of spam 

(offers of Canadian drugs, erection-producing pharmaceuticals, low-cost mortgages, and 

Nigerian lottery proceeds), questions from students, and administrative crap from my university 

that I immediately deleted.&nbsp; But then one message caught my eye; I didn�t recognize the return 

address, which was from a Yahoo account, but the subject line said, �For you, pet.�



I opened it up, and saw that it had an attachment, and started to hit the delete button, figuring it 

was just more spam.&nbsp; But then I saw the message:



�Bob,



Thought you would enjoy this little preview. 

 

Professor Bascom�



I double-clicked on the attachment, which was a jpeg file, and a photograph filled my screen.&nbsp; I 

quickly saw that it was the picture that Susan had had Laura take of me two nights ago, naked 

and kneeling in front of her, with my hands tied behind my back.&nbsp; Thankfully, Susan had blanked 

out my face and hers, so you could not tell who it was in the picture, but I knew exactly who it 

was. I groaned, and immediately deleted the mail message.&nbsp; What did she mean by �preview,� I 

thought, but I was afraid that it was not a good sign.



I looked at the clock next to the bed and saw that it was a few minutes before 6:00, so I grabbed 

Susan�s panties out of my pack, and walked down the hall to her room.&nbsp; I knocked lightly on the 

door of room 517, and after a few seconds, it swung open.&nbsp; Much to my surprise, it wasn�t Susan 

standing there, but Laura.&nbsp; �Oh crap,� I thought, �I have to deal with both Susan and her.�&nbsp; I 

muttered a �hello� to her and entered the room, as she closed the door behind me without saying 

a word.



As I walked into the room, I saw it was not just a regular hotel room, but was in fact a suite.&nbsp; I 

was a bit envious that Susan�s university would pay for her to have a suite, when most of us 

struggled to convince our employers to reimburse us for the full cost of a regular room at one of 

these conference hotels.



I was standing in a large living area.&nbsp; It had a full size sofa, small round dining table with four 

chairs around it, a television, and a couple of other plush chairs to sit in.&nbsp; I saw too that she had a 

balcony with a chaise lounge and a nice view of the city.&nbsp; Over on the other side of the room was 

a small galley kitchen, and another room that looked like it must have been a bathroom off the 

living area.&nbsp; One more closed door must have led to the bedroom.



I looked at Laura, who was standing there silently looking back at me.&nbsp; Finally, when it became 

apparent that she wasn�t going to say anything, I asked, �Where is Susan?�



�Professor Bascom will be out in a moment,� she replied.&nbsp; �Would you like something to drink 

while you wait?�



I thought about it for a second and then figured, �What the fuck.�&nbsp; Might as well have something 

to help me get through whatever Susan had planned.&nbsp; Laura�s offering of a drink, in contrast to 

my interaction with her a couple of nights ago, gave me some slight hope that maybe this was 

going to be just a chance for the three of us to laugh about what had happened, and then it would 

be all over.



�I�ll have a scotch on the rocks, if you have it,� I told Susan�s grad student as I sat down on the 

sofa.&nbsp; She turned and walked into the kitchen, opening a cabinet to retrieve a glass.&nbsp; She then 

opened another cabinet which I saw was well-stocked with four or five types of liquor, mixers, 

and assorted bar equipment.&nbsp; Now I was very envious of the accommodations Susan was 

enjoying.&nbsp; Clearly, her accomplishments had provided her with very nice treatment by her 

university.



Laura returned and handed me my drink, sitting down after in one of the chairs.&nbsp; I sipped it a bit 

as she sat there looking at me.&nbsp; Finally, after a few moments, I said somewhat exasperated and 

sarcastically, �Do you know when Susan will be making her appearance?�



Just as I got it out of my mouth, the door of the bedroom area opened and Susan came into the 

room, closing the door behind her.&nbsp; She was dressed much more casually now, in what looked 

like some kind of silk dressing robe with a sash around her waist, and no shoes on.



�Well hello again Bob, thank you for joining us,� she said with a smile, stopping a few feet in 

front of me and extending her hand.&nbsp; I stood up and shook her hand.&nbsp; �I apologize for my 

appearance, but I was running a little late and was just getting ready to jump into the shower 

when I realized what time it was.&nbsp; I had such a busy day today, running around here and there, 

going to sessions, getting caught up with people.&nbsp; You know how that is, don�t you?�



�Yes, Susan, I do,� I replied, not quite knowing how to gauge her tone and where she was going 

with the conversation.



�Excuse me, Bob, can you say that again, please?� 



I stared, standing there a couple of feet in front of her, totally bewildered.&nbsp; I saw that without her 

heels on we were now about the same height.&nbsp; I thought what I had said was quite clear.&nbsp; But 

then I looked at her eyes, which were staring straight at mine, and I realized what she wanted.



�Yes, Professor Bascom, I do know how that is,� I said.



A smile crossed her face as she released my hand.&nbsp; �Ah, much better, my pet, I�m glad you 

remember the proper way to address me.�



I resisted the temptation to look over at Laura to see how she was reacting to this act, and simply 

sat down again.&nbsp; Susan grabbed one of the stuffed chairs next to Laura, facing me, and demurely 

sat down, crossing her legs and covering them as best as she could with the robe.



�Did you bring my panties back, Bob?�



�Yes, Professor Bascom, I have them,� I replied, standing up and taking them out of my pocket.



�Bring them to me, please, pet.�



I walked over to her and handed them to her, standing over her.&nbsp; From that angle I had a nice 

view of her ample cleavage down her robe.&nbsp; I thought I could see her nipples poking into the 

robe, but it was hard to tell among the soft folds of the silk.



She reached for the panties and looked at them, then lifted them to her nose and sniffed them for 

a second.&nbsp; With a look of disgust she threw them down on the floor about five feet away and 

shouted at me, �DID YOU THINK I WANTED THEM RETURNED TO ME DIRTY, YOU 

IDIOT?�



I almost jumped and hit the ceiling, shocked as I was to be yelled at by her.&nbsp; I didn�t know what 

to say, so I mumbled a �I�m sorry,� and went to sit down again.



�Get back here, I didn�t tell you to sit down,� Susan said sternly.&nbsp; I stopped, turned around, and 

walked back to her.&nbsp; As I did, I could see Laura�s face, which had a look of intense 

concentration, staring at Susan.



As I stood in front of her again, she said in a more calm voice, �Get down on your knees.�&nbsp; Now 

wanting to endure her wrath again, I did as she told.



�I�ll forgive you this time, Bob, but you need to clean them for me now,� she said, now looking 

down at me.



�What!?!?,� I almost shouted up at her.



�You heard me,� she said, still in a calm voice.&nbsp; �Take them into the bathroom there and wash 

them for me,� and she pointed toward the bathroom off the living area.



I couldn�t believe she was making me do this.&nbsp; The humiliation of this act was compounded by 

Laura witnessing it.&nbsp; Usually, I was the one with the power over the grad students, and the idea 

that this young woman was watching Susan debase me was mortifying.&nbsp; �Oh, come on Su --, I 

mean Professor Bascom,� I said.&nbsp; �Give me a break, this is ridiculous.�



�Bob,� she said, still with a calm in her voice.&nbsp; �Did you get my e-mail a little while ago?�



�Yes,� I replied.



�And you realize, of course, that I have a copy of that photo without your face blurred out.�



�Yes, Professor Bascom,� I replied solemnly, �I realize that.�



�Good.&nbsp; Then being the smart man that you are, I�m sure you also realize that as easily as I e-

mailed that picture to you, I could send the other version of it to anybody I so choose.&nbsp; Such as 

your department chair, your colleagues, and even Sarah.�



The thought of any of these possibilities was nauseating, but I was particularly concerned about 

the idea of my wife, Sarah, seeing the pictures and finding out what had happened.&nbsp; I looked up 

at Susan, and after hesitating a few seconds, I said defeatedly, �Yes, Professor Bascom, I know 

that.�



�Okay, then what do you need to do?� she asked.



I went to pick up the panties on the floor next to me, but before I could reach for them she said, 

�I asked you a question, Bob.�



I stopped, and turned back to her.&nbsp; �I need to wash them.�



She just stared at me, again with that intent gaze, waiting for me to correct myself.



I sighed, and said, �I need to wash your panties for you, Professor Bascom.�



She gave me a small smile and replied, �Much better, pet.&nbsp; Now get to your task.&nbsp; Be sure to 

wash them thoroughly, and you�ll find a hair dryer in there you can use to dry them.�



I reached for the panties one more time, but she stopped me once again.&nbsp; �No, pet, don�t use your 

hands, that would be too easy for you.&nbsp; Crawl over there and pick them up with your mouth, then 

crawl to the bathroom.�



I hesitated again, not believing she was doing this to me.&nbsp; When I first came to her room, I really 

had hoped that I would return the panties, we�d laugh, and it would be over with.&nbsp; She would 

have had her kinky little fun and games the other night, and that would be the end of it.&nbsp; But I 

realized now there was going to be more of her dominance to which I was going to have to 

submit.



Resigned to my fate, I crawled the few feet over to the panties, leaned forward and picked them 

with my mouth, and then turned to crawl to the bathroom.&nbsp; As I did so, I heard Susan let out a 

little �Woof, woof � just like a good doggy, huh Laura?�



Laura chuckled a little and said, �Yes, Professor Bascom.�



Thoroughly humiliated, I scampered on all fours over to the bathroom as fast as I could.&nbsp; When I 

got in there, I heard Susan say, �Okay, you can stand up now so you can reach the sink and 

dryer.�



I stood, thankful to get off my knees.&nbsp; I turned on the tap and waited for the hot water to come 

out, and when it did, I began to soak the panties in the sink.



I heard Susan�s voice directly behind me now saying, �Be sure to use some soap, they were 

pretty dirty, weren�t they pet?�



Turning and seeing her standing there watching me, I replied, �Yes, ma�am,� and proceeded to 

unwrap the small hotel bar of soap next to the sink and rub it over the panties.



�Much better, pet.�



I soaped them up, then soaked them again in the sink.&nbsp; I emptied the water and filled up the basin 

with clean water, dabbing the panties up and down.&nbsp; The act of doing this caused the memory of 

my servicing Susan�s pussy in the bathroom a couple of nights ago to flood back into my brain.&nbsp; I 

was once again ashamed to realize that the sense of humiliation of how I felt between her legs 

that night was causing me to be aroused, as I felt my cock stirring in my pants.



After rinsing out the panties, I bunched them up in my hands to get out the excess water, and 

then took the hair dryer off the wall.&nbsp; I put it on a medium setting, and holding the panties in one 

hand, proceeded to wave the dryer all around them, trying my best to get them dry as soon as 

possible so I could get this over with.



After about five minutes of this, they were dry.&nbsp; As I put the dryer back, I gazed into the mirror, 

and saw Susan still standing and leaning against the door frame with a smile on her face.



I turned and handed them to her.&nbsp; She simply stood, staring at me once again, the smile now 

having left her face.



After a few moments, I realized what she was waiting for.&nbsp; �Here are your panties, Professor 

Bascom, all cleaned,� I said.



She smiled again and reached out and took them from my hand.&nbsp; �Thank you, pet, much better,� 

as she rubbed her fingers over them and then sniffed them.&nbsp; �Now please give me a hand.�&nbsp; And 

with that, she handed them back to me, but I was unsure exactly what she wanted me to do with 

them now.



She stepped into the bathroom, stood next to me, and placed one hand on my shoulder.&nbsp; She 

undid the sash on her robe, causing it to fall open.&nbsp; As she did, I got a partial view of her large 

breasts, though her nipples were still covered by the robe.&nbsp; But her shaved pussy was quite 

visible to me, which only reinforced the memories of my servitude to her.



I felt her hand pushing down on my shoulder as she said, �Please help me into them, pet.�



Understanding what she wanted, I knelt down in the bathroom with the panties as she lifted her 

right foot off the ground.&nbsp; I put the panties around that foot, and then she shifted to raise the left 

one.&nbsp; I put the other leg hole around that foot, and as she placed it back on the tile of the 

bathroom, I lifted them up her legs, and did my best to situate them over her curvy ass and on to 

her waist.&nbsp; As I kneeled there, I got a good look at her shaved pussy as it was just about at my 

eye level.&nbsp; More importantly, I got a good whiff of it, and it was quite evident that Susan was 

being truthful when she said she had not had a chance to shower before I got there, as her pussy 

was quite ripe from the day�s activities.&nbsp; I sensed also just a hint of her arousal that had 

enveloped me the other night in the bathroom, and I knew that she once again was being turned 

on by what she was doing to me.



�Very good, pet, thank you,� she said with a smile.&nbsp; She turned and walked out of the bathroom.&nbsp; 

At that point, I realized that I had to pee, so I started to close the door.



I heard Susan say, �What are you doing?�



I opened the door enough so she could see me and replied, �I have to go to the bathroom.�



She laughed. �What, all the running water got to you, huh?�



�I guess so.�



�Okay, go ahead, then.&nbsp; But leave the door open.�



I simply stared at her and uttered, �What?�



�You heard me, leave the door open.�



At this I didn�t respond, but pushed the door open all the way.&nbsp; I resignedly unzipped my fly, and 

began to take out my cock, but before I could I heard Susan�s voice, this time right behind me 

again.&nbsp; �No, Bob, I don�t want to take a chance on you dirtying up my bathroom.&nbsp; Sit down on 

the toilet if you have to pee.�



More humiliation, I thought, but knowing there was little I could do, I undid my belt and dropped 

my trousers to my ankles.&nbsp; I then pushed my boxers down over my cock, which was still slightly 

erect, and before I could turn around, I heard her say, �Nice ass you have there, Bob.&nbsp; At least for 

a guy.�&nbsp; She laughed, and then said, �Come here, Laura, why don�t you check him out.�



I stood still as I heard Laura walking toward me.



�What do you think, Laura, does he have a nice ass?� Susan asked her.



�Yes, Professor Bascom,� was all she said.



�And now the front, Bob.&nbsp; Turn around and give us another view of that penis of yours.�



I did as she told, shuffling around with my trousers and boxers at my ankles.&nbsp; As my semi-erect 

cock bobbed in front of me, I blushed, which Susan immediately picked up on.



�Why, I think he�s a little embarrassed, aren�t you Bob,� she said to Laura.



Ashamed, I said, �Yes, ma�am.�



�Well, nothing to be ashamed of, Bob.&nbsp; Laura and I already knew you were a pussy-loving little 

pet who enjoys being bossed around, didn�t we?�



�Yes, we did, Professor Bascom.�



Susan laughed and said to me, �Okay, Bob, go ahead.�



Between the two of them watching me, and my bobbing cock, I didn�t think there was anyway I 

would be able to pee.&nbsp; But I really had to go, so I sat down, and waited for a few moments as the 

two of them stood there.&nbsp; Thankfully, my erection finally subsided enough for me to push my 

cock down and pee into the toilet.&nbsp; After I finished, I stood up, pulled up my boxers and pants, 

and waited.



Susan turned and walked back into the living area, followed by Laura.&nbsp; Susan had re-tied the sash 

on her robe, which now hugged her ample ass which swayed as she walked.&nbsp; I followed them 

into the room as Susan sat on the couch this time, Laura next to her.&nbsp; She motioned for me to sit 

in one of the chairs facing them.



We sat silently for a minute or so, Susan just staring at me.&nbsp; Finally, she said, �You have been a 

naughty little boy, haven�t you Bob?�



I stared back at her and said, �Actually, I�ve done everything you�ve asked me to Sus � uh, 

Professor Bascom, so can�t we bring this whole thing to a close and just forget about it?�



�No, I don�t think so, pet.&nbsp; I�ve been thinking about just what you did the other night, and how 

embarrassing it is for a senior professor like you to be caught in such a compromising position.&nbsp; 

I�ve decided that the punishment you�ve endured is not enough yet.�



�Oh, come on,� I replied with anger in my voice, �give me a break.&nbsp; Haven�t you had enough of 

your little game, yet?�



�No, Bob, I haven�t had enough yet.&nbsp; I will tell you when I�ve had enough.&nbsp; Now get over here.�



I stood up, and once again I had a fleeting thought of just getting up and walking out of the room.&nbsp; 

I really thought Susan was bluffing about sending the pictures out or telling anybody what had 

happened.&nbsp; But I knew I simply couldn�t take the chance, so I walked over toward her and Laura.



�Take off your shoes and socks, and drop your trousers and boxers, Bob,� Susan said as I stood 

before her.&nbsp; Dejectedly, I took off the shoes and socks and once again undid my belt and 

followed her command.&nbsp; 



�Now get up here and kneel on the sofa, leaning over the back.�



I looked at her alarmedly and said, �Why?&nbsp; What are going to do?�



�Just do as I said, Bob,� she replied in a stern voice.&nbsp; �As I told you, you still need to be punished 

for being a naughty little pet.�



Hearing that tone, I did as she said, getting up on the sofa with my ankles with my pants and 

boxers bunched around them hanging over the edge.&nbsp; I leaned forward with my arms and head on 

the padded, rounded back of the sofa.



�Laura, take off his pants and underwear.�



I felt Laura complying, leaving me totally naked from the waist down.&nbsp; I was wearing a polo shirt 

that did little to cover up my bare ass.&nbsp; I shivered at the thought of what was going to happen.



I felt Susan�s hand rubbing over my ass, which admittedly felt good, as I heard her say, �I think a 

naughty little boy needs a good spanking, don�t you Laura?�



�Yes, ma�am,� she replied.



�And I�ve got just the person to administer it,� Susan said, removing her hand from my ass.&nbsp; I 

felt her rise from the couch, and I had the sickening feeling that she was going to tell Laura to 

spank me.&nbsp; The thought that this grad student was going to be doing this to me was awful, and I 

shuddered at the thought.



But I heard Susan walk away from the couch.&nbsp; She came into my view as she headed toward the 

door to the bedroom of the suite.&nbsp; I looked over at her as she opened it, smiled, and said to 

somebody inside, �C�mon out, my dear.&nbsp; Time for you to join all the fun we�ve been having.�



As horrified as I had been at what had transpired over the last fifteen minutes, the feeling was 

compounded ten times as I saw who Susan had invited into the room to administer the 

punishment.

I suggest you read the earlier chapters of this story first



*************



�Oh god,� I thought, �I can�t believe this.&nbsp; Where is it going to end?�



Here I was, bent over the back of the sofa in Professor Susan Bascom�s hotel suite, naked from the waist down, with Susan�s graduate student Laura standing nearby watching me.&nbsp; And to my horror, when Susan opened the door to the bedroom of the suite, I couldn�t believe who walked out.



�Yes, Bob, we both decided that you needed a little more training in the appropriate way to treat women, didn�t we, hon?� Susan said to the newcomer.



I just stared at the two of them, unbelieving at what I was seeing.&nbsp; The incredulity must have shown in my face, because I&nbsp; heard Susan say, �What�s wrong, Bob?&nbsp; I thought you�d be happy to see Sarah here.&nbsp; Don�t you miss her?�



Yes, I missed my wife, but the last thing I wanted was for her to be witnessing this.&nbsp; All I could think was, �What the hell is she doing here?�



Sarah had a little smile on her face and hadn�t said a word yet, but continued to stand next to Susan who had an even bigger shit-eating grin on her face.



I finally managed to mumble, �Sarah, what are you doing here?�



Before she could say anything, Susan answered for her.&nbsp; �Well, Bob, after our little encounter in the women�s room the other night, I decided that you really did need more training than I had provided to you.&nbsp; What you need is what we call in the academic world, better �mentoring� � somebody who can help you learn appropriate mores and etiquette, the right way to act around your superiors, especially women.�



She turned to Laura and asked, �You understand these things, don�t you, pet?&nbsp; You know the right way to act around me because I�ve been a good mentor to you, haven�t I?�



Laura quickly answered, �Oh yes, Professor Bascom, you�ve mentored me very well.�



�Good, pet, and I�ve figured out that it is exactly that kind of training that Professor Arnold here needs, right Bob?�



I stared over at her and Sarah, still not believing my wife was standing there as a party to this encounter.



�I said, right Bob?� Susan said to me in a slightly louder voice.



�Yes, Su � I mean, yes Professor Bascom,� I replied.&nbsp; As I said this, I saw Sarah cock an eyebrow for a second.&nbsp; I�m sure the shock of her seeing me almost naked like this on the couch was one thing, but hearing my verbal subservience to Susan was another.



�That�s right, Bob, and Sarah is going to help me to train you.�&nbsp; With that she grabbed Sarah�s hand and the two of them walked over to me.&nbsp; I looked back over my shoulder at Sarah.&nbsp; She was wearing a pair of gray slacks and a plum-colored silk blouse.&nbsp; She too was somewhat plump, not unlike Susan, and her blouse nicely showed off her ample breasts.



As they stood next to me, I began to rise up from the couch, but before I got too far, I heard Susan say, �No, Bob, you can stay right where you are.�



But this time I chose to ignore her.&nbsp; I had had enough, with Sarah here in the room I knew I had to bring the whole thing to a halt.&nbsp; �No, Susan � I am getting up, I need to talk to Sarah.�



As I continued to rise up, I felt a hand on the back of my head, pushing me back down.&nbsp; I was about to swat Susan�s hand away, but as I glanced that way, I saw it was not Susan�s hand that was pushing me down, but Sarah�s.&nbsp; Surprised and confused, I allowed her to push me back down so that my head was again resting on the back of the couch.&nbsp; �What�s going on, Sarah?� I asked her.



�I�m sorry, Bob, but I agree with Susan.&nbsp; I want you to stay there and listen to me,� she said.&nbsp; I didn�t say anything, signaling my acquiescence.



Sarah continued, �When Susan called me the other evening, and explained to me what had happened, at first I didn�t believe her.&nbsp; She told me everything, from how you followed her and Laura into the bathroom, to what happened when she discovered you there, to what she did to you.�



As Sarah started to describe her conversation with Susan, I became a bit wary.&nbsp; Sarah and I had a very active sex life, and we had engaged in numerous types of roleplaying, including some dominance and submission play.&nbsp; And we had been on again and off again swingers, so we certainly weren�t prudes in any way.&nbsp; But never had we � or I � done anything like what had happened to me in that women�s restroom in the hotel two nights ago.&nbsp; So I was not quite sure how she was going to react to what she had heard about.&nbsp; I was also surprised at what was turning out to be a level of familiarity between Susan and Sarah that I hadn�t known had existed.&nbsp; I knew they had occasionally e-mailed with each other, and had met a couple of times when Sarah accompanied me to conferences, but didn�t think it went beyond that.



�Because I didn�t believe her,� Sarah continued, �Susan offered to e-mail me one of the pictures, and I took her up on her offer.&nbsp; Needless to say, when I received it I was shocked to see that she was telling the truth.&nbsp; I just didn�t want to believe you�d do something so risky, Bob.&nbsp; So when I called Susan back after I got her e-mail, we had a long chat about how we should proceed.&nbsp; She suggested that I fly out and join her here, and that the two of us could deal with it together.&nbsp; So I did, and here I am.�&nbsp; 



With that she, gave me a little smile, and I knew that I was sunk.&nbsp; Any thought that she would help me to talk sense into Susan�s head went right out of my mind as I realized that she was apparently in this just as much as Susan was.&nbsp; I now had to deal not just with Susan�s wrath, and what she had planned for me, but now also had to worry about Sarah�s participation.



Now it was Susan�s turn to chime in again.&nbsp; �Very well explained, Sarah.&nbsp; So you see, Bob, that�s why your dear wife is here with us right now, so she can help me mentor you in the appropriate way to behave around women.&nbsp; So are you ready to begin?�



I sighed, and simply answered, �Yes, if we must.�



Susan glared at me once again, showing her disapproval.&nbsp; I immediately knew what she wanted, and quickly replied, �Yes, ma�am, I am ready to begin.�



Susan smiled once again, and said to Sarah, �See, dear, it really is quite easy once you have them trained a bit.&nbsp; Now, let�s see, how do we want to start?�&nbsp; She hesitated for a few seconds, and I just lay there over the back of the couch, fretting over exactly what she was going to do.



After a few moments, Susan said, �Laura, pet, come over here please.�



I turned my head the other way to look over at Laura as she came back toward me.&nbsp; Susan saw me look, however, and as Laura came nearby, she said to her, �Do me a favor, pet.&nbsp; Get my scarf from the bedroom.�



�Yes, ma�am,� Laura replied, and I saw her walk into the other room. 



A few seconds later, I heard Laura pad quietly across the carpet to a spot behind me.&nbsp; Susan said to her, �Okay, pet, now tie it around Bob�s head � we don�t want him getting distracted by watching everything.�



I felt Laura kneel on the couch, and then felt the cool silk over my eyes as she tied the scarf tightly around my head.&nbsp; I was now enveloped in darkness, which only helped to heighten all my other senses.



�Okay, now we�ll get started.&nbsp; So here�s what we�re going to do Bob.&nbsp; To start your training in the appropriate way to appreciate women, we�re going to spank you.&nbsp; And your job is to tell us which of the three of us is administering the punishment to you.&nbsp; If you get it right, you�ll be rewarded; wrong, and you�ll be further punished.&nbsp; Do you understand?�



I was so humiliated, thinking about what was about to happen, and especially by the idea of both my wife and Susan�s young grad student witnessing and participating.&nbsp; But I knew I was sunk, and had no choice but to play along.&nbsp; �Yes, ma�am, I understand,� I replied.



�It�s not just �ma�am,� Bob � you have three women here who you need to be attentive to,� Susan scolded me.



I was stumped for few moments, not quite sure how to respond to this.&nbsp; As I sat there, kneeling on the couch, naked from the waist down, trying to figure it out, I quickly felt a sharp slap on my left cheek.



�Ow,� I shouted in response, without thinking.



�What was that?� I heard Susan�s voice say.



I quickly replied, �I�m sorry, mistresses.�



�That�s better, Bob.&nbsp; Now tell me � which one of us was it that just laid that blow upon your scrawny little ass?�



I thought for just a second, and realized the speed with which I was hit must have meant that it was Susan who inflicted the punishment.&nbsp; There was not enough time for her to have signaled Sarah or Laura to hit me.&nbsp; �It was you, Professor Bascom,� I answered.



�Oh, very good Bob � you�re doing just fine so far!� And with that, she lightly rubbed my ass, right over what was by now no doubt a very red spot on my cheek.&nbsp; �Okay, ladies,� she continued, �why don�t the two of you come over here right next to me.&nbsp; Remember to address us appropriately, Bob, and I don�t want to hear any whining or complaining.�



I continued kneeling there as I heard the rustling of people moving around behind me, and after a few seconds, Susan said, �Get ready, Bob, here�s the next one.�



I tensed up, awaiting the next blow to rain down on my ass.&nbsp; It seemed like minutes of anticipation, but I knew it must have only been a few seconds � and then it hit me, a hard smack upon the other cheek from the first.&nbsp; It took everything in my being to resist crying out in pain, but somehow I managed.&nbsp; I thought for a second, trying to figure out which of the three women hit me.&nbsp; I knew Susan was playing mind games with me, and I was trying to outguess her.&nbsp; I quickly decided she would have had one of the other two land that second blow, and it seemed too hard for it to have been Laura.&nbsp; I suspected she would be a little timid at first, and there was nothing shy about the hand that had just hit me.



�That was Mistress Sarah,� I said.



�Bravo, Bob � I�m very impressed.&nbsp; You�re two for two.�



I sighed silently, hoping that my stellar performance would bring an end to it.&nbsp; After all, Susan had said I�d be rewarded if I guessed right.&nbsp; But before I could be too proud of myself, another shot landed on the same ass cheek.&nbsp; This one did, in fact, feel lighter than the others, so I quickly said with great confidence, �That would be Laur - er, Mistress Laura.�



�Oh, I�m sorry, Bob, but you�re wrong,� Susan replied.&nbsp; �That was my hand again, you�re perfect streak is broken.&nbsp; And you know what that means.�



I steeled myself, ready for more punishment, but after waiting a few seconds, nothing came.



�I said, you know what that means, don�t you Bob?�



I quickly replied in defeat, �Yes, Mistress Susan, it means I will be punished more.�



�That�s right, my little worm.� And with that, she � or somebody � quickly hit me four more times, twice on each cheek in succession, and there was nothing light about these blows.&nbsp; Again, I had to bite my lip to prevent myself from crying out in pain, but I somehow managed.&nbsp; �That was you, Mistress Susan,� I mumbled under my breath.



�What was that, Bob, I can�t hear you?�



Having caught my breath, I spoke up.&nbsp; �That was you, Mistress Susan.�



�Ah yes, you are definitely learning the feel of my hand upon your ass, you are doing much better now, my pet.&nbsp; I think we�re going to stop here for a moment since you�re doing so well.�



I sighed again, happy to have a respite � no matter how brief � from the attacks that I knew must have turned my ass cheeks bright red.&nbsp; I began to sit back on my ankles, but somebody tapped me lightly and I heard Sarah this time say, �No Bob, we�re not done with you yet.�



I was surprised to hear Sarah saying this, as I still saw her as more of a passive participant in this whole scene, following along with Susan�s lead.&nbsp; But she clearly was playing a more assertive role than I had thought she would.&nbsp; I pulled myself back up to a kneeling position, once again with my head and chest resting on the back of the sofa.



�I�ll be right back, ladies,� Susan said, and I heard her pad off away from the sofa.&nbsp; I realized she must have gone into her bedroom, because I didn�t hear the sound of her shoes on the tile of the bathroom floor.&nbsp; A minute or so later, I heard her footsteps approach again.&nbsp; As she came closer, I heard my wife giggle, a sound that sent my mind spinning with questions about what Susan had in mind.



For about a minute nothing happened � no sound of walking, nor any other sound that would clue me in to what was coming next.&nbsp; I was thankful that the spankings had stopped, at least for now.&nbsp; But I was still nervously anticipating Susan�s � and I knew it would be Susan, because she was clearly in charge � next move.



I felt somebody�s hands on the inside of my knees perched on the sofa, gently easing them outward, causing me to spread my legs even further than they already were.&nbsp; Even without any words being spoken, it was clear what the intent was.



And then I felt it � a cold, damp sensation at the top of the crack of my ass.&nbsp; I wasn�t sure what it was, and strangely, my first thought was that there was some kind of leak from the ceiling.&nbsp; But then I felt the sensation of something very viscous slowly dripping down the crack toward my rosebud.&nbsp; And then I felt more large, cold drops of the same liquid dropped right upon the first spot, and they too dripped down my rosebud, past it, and down my ball sack where it felt like it was pooling in the hair there.



It was then that I realized it must have been some sort of lube that Susan had gotten from her bedroom, and she was now dripping it down my ass.&nbsp; I was so embarrassed, thinking about what I must have looked like � my legs spread wide on the couch, my ass up in the air, lewdly exposed to the three women.&nbsp; And now, some kind of lube dripping down my crack toward my balls.&nbsp; I ground my head even further into the back of the sofa, wishing I could just disappear into it, never to be seen again.



Just as I thought I was going to die from shame, I heard the sound of somebody sucking in their breath, as if to try to catch it after seeing something unexpected.&nbsp; I wasn�t sure which of the three women it was, but then I heard Susan say, �Yes, my dear, that�s quite a sight, isn�t it?&nbsp; Professor Arnold crouched there, with his nether regions so beautifully exposed to us, so open to us to do anything we wish, aren�t they?�



Much to my surprise, it was Laura�s voice I heard next.&nbsp; �Yes, ma�am, it is quite a sight.�&nbsp; I was surprised that Laura was the one who had reacted as she did.&nbsp; I realized that she must have never been in this position with Susan before, Susan dominating somebody � especially a man � the way that she was doing to me.&nbsp; I wasn�t sure whether Laura�s reaction was one of shock, disgust, or arousal, however; her voice did not betray what she was thinking.



�Come here, my pet, come closer,� Susan said, most likely to Laura.&nbsp; �I want you to experience this for yourself.�&nbsp; I heard Laura walk quietly from the side of me, where she had been, to position herself behind me, next to where I had been hearing Susan�s voice coming from.



I felt a hand on the back of my head, lightly tracing fingers down the back of my neck, then my back, and down right to the spot just above where Susan had dropped the lube.&nbsp; �I want you to just relax, Bob,� Susan said in a soft voice.&nbsp; �You are here for our pleasure, and you know that there is nothing you can do about it, don�t you.�&nbsp; I lightly nodded my head, resigned once again to my fate.



�I want to hear your voice, Bob, I want to hear the confirmation that you submit to our dominance,� she said in the same quiet tone.



�Yes, Professor Bascom, I understand that I have no choice but to submit to your wishes.�



�And the others, too, Bob?�



I sighed and confirmed, �Yes, Mistress Laura and Mistress Sarah also.�



�Good, then we will continue.&nbsp; Come here, Laura.&nbsp; Take your finger, and run it up and down Bob�s well-lubricated ass.�



I gasped uncontrollably at the realization of what Susan was now doing.&nbsp; Somehow, hearing her give the instruction out loud to her graduate student, made the entire episode that much more humiliating to me.&nbsp; The thought that this student, who two days ago probably held me in some esteem based on my professional standing, was now standing behind me as I was crouched naked and lewdly displayed to her, ready to submit to whatever she chose to do to me, was just too much to bear.&nbsp; I began quietly sobbing at my predicament.



Susan must have heard this, as did Sarah.&nbsp; I felt a hand stroking my hair over the blindfold, and heard Sarah�s voice whispering in my ear, �That�s okay my love, just relax.&nbsp; You need this; you need to be taught the proper way to respect women.&nbsp; I promise you, no harm will come to you � I�ve gotten Susan to agree to that.&nbsp; But you must endure your training.�



I did my best to fight back the tears, and lightly nodded my head in agreement.&nbsp; All I could do was just hope that they would get this �training� over with as quickly as possible, and then Sarah and I could go on with our lives � hopefully never to talk about this horrendous experience again.



�Okay, Bob, are you ready to continue now?� Susan asked.&nbsp; 



I sniffled back the tears and replied, �Yes, Professor Bascom.�



I then felt a finger, Laura�s presumably, doing as Susan had instructed.&nbsp; She ran it up and down my crack, and it moved very effortlessly because of the liberal dose of lubrication that had been poured down it.



After a minute or two of this, Susan said, �You know what to do next, don�t you my pet?�



�Yes, ma�am,� Laura replied, and then I felt it � a prodding finger upon my asshole, pressing lightly at first, then more strongly.&nbsp; She was clearly trying to be gentle, but yet at the same time was tactically insistent on what she was going to accomplish.&nbsp; Sarah and I had engaged in anal play many times, so the sensations were not totally foreign to me.&nbsp; The setting, however, was, and it was hard to endure what was happening, but I did my best to steel myself for it.



Laura continued rotating her finger around, slowly easing it into my asshole, until the point where I realized she must have been in up to about her first knuckle.&nbsp; Luckily, she was fairly slim built, and her fingers mirrored her body size, so it really was not very painful at all.&nbsp; It was more the humiliation that was getting to me, knowing that this student was fingering me in the ass � and my wife and professional colleague were watching her do it.



And then, before I knew what was happening, the realization hit me that my body was responding to what she was doing.&nbsp; I felt my cock stiffening as she slowly rotated her finger around, and then began pistoning it in and out of my ass.&nbsp; No doubt, Sarah was not surprised; she knew about my submissive nature, and she knew how turned on I could get when she would dominate me anally.&nbsp; But I was surprised at my body�s reaction in the face of being watched by these two other women.&nbsp; But somehow my mind must have migrated into that subspace that it reaches when I am being dominated, because I was definitely getting aroused, and I knew my erection would betray me.



And right on cue, I heard a clap, and Susan�s voice exclaim with glee, �Oh I just knew it � I just knew he was such a little subbie boy who loved having things stuck up his ass.&nbsp; Look at his funny little penis.�&nbsp; All three women giggled at Susan�s exclamation of surprise and excitement as Laura continued working her finger in and out of my ass.



She was right, and I don�t know if she figured it out on her own, or if she had been clued in by Sarah.&nbsp; I was greatly turned on by having my ass played with, especially as part of dominance and submission.&nbsp; It was an involuntary response, even in the face of the situation in which I found myself.



I felt fingers close around my now fully-erect cock, and felt the hand stroke lightly up and down the shaft.&nbsp; I was not sure whose fingers they were, but then I heard Susan say, �Yup, no doubt about it � he likes this!� and I realized it was she who was working my cock.&nbsp; I had to admit it felt good; the combined sensation of Laura�s finger in my ass, and Susan�s around my cock, was quite a turn on.



Susan released my cock, and then I felt fingers � presumably hers � joining Laura�s on my ass.&nbsp; The fingers wiped up and down my crack a few times, and then before I knew what was happening, they closed again around my cock, this time stroking it even more fluidly than before because of the lubrication.



They both continued for a few minutes, Laura pushing her finger even further into my ass. I was afraid that they would make me cum like this as the arousal was building in my body.&nbsp; My breathing became heavier as I was hunched over the back of the couch, but then I felt Susan�s fingers release from my cock and I felt a hard smack across my right ass cheek.&nbsp; I yelped an involuntary �Ow!�



Susan said, �Tsk, tsk, Bob � know cumming for you, my pet.&nbsp; You should know that you can only cum when we women give you permission.�



I resisted the temptation to put my hand back on my sore ass to rub it, and simply replied in a defeated voice, �Yes, Mistress Susan.�



�That�s right, and don�t you forget it,� she replied.&nbsp; �Okay, Laura, you can stop that.�&nbsp; And with that command, I felt her finger removed immediately from my asshole.&nbsp; It felt very open and empty, much more so than it had ten minutes ago.



�But we�re not done with your training yet, are we ladies?� Susan inquired of the other two.&nbsp; I couldn�t see how they reacted, as they did not say anything, but I presumed they nodded in acquiescence.&nbsp; �Yes, we have much more to do.�



I once again heard and felt Susan step away from behind me, and it sounded like she was walking around in the living room of her hotel suite.&nbsp; I then heard one of the other two women walk away, and then heard the sound of shoes tapping in the bathroom, and the sound of water running.&nbsp; I assumed that was Laura washing her hand after she had been working my asshole so vigorously.



I heard both pairs of feet on the carpet as they approached me again.&nbsp; There was no movement for a minute,&nbsp; and then without warning, I sensed a flash through my blindfold.&nbsp; This was quickly followed by two more, and I realized that somebody was taking pictures of me, prostrate over the back of the couch, all spread open for the world to see.&nbsp; Just more evidence that I assumed Susan would be able to use against me in the future.



Much to my surprise, though, it was Sarah�s voice that I heard next.&nbsp; �Now that will certainly make a pretty picture for us, don�t you think my dear?� she asked.&nbsp; �Where do you think we should hang one of those � in our bedroom, where only you and I would get to see it?�



I mumbled to her, �Whatever,� which was followed by another, albeit lighter, slap upon my ass.&nbsp; �Is that the proper way to address me, Bob?� she said.



�No, Mistress Sarah, I�m sorry.&nbsp; I would rather you not put that picture anywhere, to be honest.�



She laughed, and said, �Don�t worry, I was just joking.&nbsp; But it�s nice to know that I have it if I ever decide I do want to use it.&nbsp; Or perhaps even share it with my friends here, right ladies?&nbsp; It will make such a nice complement to the pictures that Susan took the other night in the bathroom.�



The three of them laughed about that, and then I heard somebody walk away again.&nbsp; I heard something being put down on the glass-topped table, and I hoped it was the camera.



Sarah walked back toward me, and I heard her say, �What about this, Professor Bascom?&nbsp; This could be fun?�



Susan replied enthusiastically, �Oh yes, it definitely could!�



I had no idea what they were talking about, but then I sensed somebody leaning over me.&nbsp; I felt fingers on the blindfold, and it was pulled down below my eyes, but not off my head.&nbsp; I blinked a few times as the bright light of the room assaulted my eyes.&nbsp; As they adjusted, I realized there was something right next to my head.&nbsp; I turned my head that way to get a better look, and my jaw dropped open when I realized what was there.



�That�s right, Bob,� Sarah said.&nbsp; �Think it�s time for the next step of your training.�















I suggest you read the earlier chapters of this story first



*************



I was utterly defeated, lying across the couch in the hotel room, being watched � and dominated by my wife 

Sarah, my professional colleague, Susan Bascom, and her graduate student, Laura.&nbsp; At that point all I wanted 

was for the ordeal to be over, but I knew it would not be until Susan � or Mistress Susan, as I was being forced 

to call her � decided it would be over.



After Laura had stuck her finger up my well-lubricated ass, and Susan had fondled my cock, Sarah stood next 

to me holding a red, flared butt plug.&nbsp; It was similar to, but not exactly the same, as one of the ones we 

occasionally used in our play.&nbsp; And she had just suggested that she use it on me, in full view of the two other 

women.&nbsp; The three of them drew closer, so that they formed a semi-circle around me.



As my eyes adjusted to the light after having the blindfold removed, I glanced at the three of them, and they all 

had smiles on their faces.&nbsp; I could tell they were enjoying this act of my humiliation, relishing in the power they 

held over me.&nbsp; But it was more than that; something else was gnawing at me as I waited on the couch, my ass, 

dripping with lube, sticking out at them, and my cock still erect.&nbsp; They stood still, not saying a word.&nbsp; I thought 

perhaps Susan was going to spank me again, or perhaps she was just waiting to decide what to do.



And then it hit me � I smelled something very familiar.&nbsp; It was the scent of female arousal.&nbsp; I was not sure which 

of them was secreting the scent, or perhaps it was all three, but there was no question that at least one of them 

was getting off on this sexually.&nbsp; I knew that Susan had been aroused earlier, that was for sure, but for some 

reason I suspected she wasn�t the only one that I was now smelling.&nbsp; At first I was shocked, because I saw the 

entire thing as a power play on Susan�s, and later, Laura and Sarah�s parts.&nbsp; But then it occurred to me that there 

was no reason they should not enjoy the wielding of power as a sexual thrill as well.&nbsp; I knew how turned on 

Sarah got when we practiced dominance and submission, so why shouldn�t the same be true for the other two 

women as well?



I sneaked a peek over my shoulder at the three of them, and they were glancing at each other, looking somewhat 

unsure what to do next.&nbsp; They looked at one another, then down at me, catching my glance.&nbsp; I turned away in 

shame, and buried my head once again in the upholstered back of the sofa.&nbsp; �Please, just get it over with,� I 

thought to myself, too scared to express the thought, however, for fear it would just prolong the ordeal.



And then I heard Susan�s voice.&nbsp; �Would you like to go ahead, Sarah, you�ve obviously had the most experience 

in this situation,� she said.



Sarah hesitated for a second or two, but then responded, �Oh no, Susan, you�re right � I get to do this all the 

time.&nbsp; Perhaps it would make more of an impression on him if you or Laura had the honors.�



Susan chuckled for a moment.&nbsp; �Yes, you�re right.&nbsp; We are trying to train the little subbie, so we want to 

maximize the effect.&nbsp; Let�s see � you had the opportunity to stick your finger up his ass, Laura� � just hearing 

those words made me cringe � �so I think I will be the one to stick this up there.&nbsp; So listen up, Bob � here are 

your instructions.&nbsp; I am going to stick this plug up your subbie little ass, and you�re going to take it like a man � 

no whining or complaining.&nbsp; Do you understand?�



Without hesitation, I responded, �Yes, Mistress Bascom.�



�Good.&nbsp; After I put it in there, you�ll need to make sure it stays.&nbsp; If you lose it, you�ll be further punished.&nbsp; Do 

you understand that, too?�



�Yes, ma�am.�



And without saying another word, I felt the tip of the plug touching my anal ring.&nbsp; Fortunately, it had been well 

lubricated by Laura�s fingers, so I hoped it would not hurt too much.&nbsp; Susan gave it a firm, continuous push, and 

it quickly popped into my ass, the flared part entering enough that it would be held there by the contraction of 

my anal muscles.



I grunted to myself as she shoved it in, but managed to take it without uttering anything.&nbsp; It was about the same 

size as one Sarah and I had used, so I knew what to expect.&nbsp; And I also had had experience holding it there, so I 

hoped that I would be able to do so under these somewhat more adverse circumstances.



�Very good, my pet,� I heard Susan saying.&nbsp; �You took the whole thing.&nbsp; Doesn�t he look just wonderful, 

ladies, lying there, his butt sticking out, with that red plug filling his subbie little asshole so beautifully.�



Laura said in a somewhat hushed voice, �Oh yes, Professor Bascom.�&nbsp; Sarah didn�t say a word.&nbsp; I kept my head 

buried in the sofa back, but I kept smelling the scent of female arousal.&nbsp; I was sure at this point that the scene 

was becoming a big turn-on for at least some of them.



�Just look at him ladies, so subservient, kneeling there with his butt plug, willing to do whatever we say, aren�t 

you Bob?�



I didn�t answer until I felt a soft swat on my ass.&nbsp; �Yes, Professor Bascom,� I replied.



�Yes what, Bob?�



�Yes, I�ll do whatever you want.&nbsp; I just want this to be over with and get out of here.�



�Well, it won�t be over with until I decide it�s over, is that clear, pet,� she responded.



�Yes, ma�am.�



I felt her take a step closer to me, and heard her say in a soft voice � loud enough, I realized, for the other two 

women to hear � �You�re not getting off that easily, Bob.&nbsp; You still have work to do.�



She leaned back again and said, �Laura, pet, get the scarf and put it back on Professor Arnold�s eyes.&nbsp; I don�t 

think he needs to see for what we�re going to do next.�



�Yes, ma�am,� I heard Laura reply, and then felt the silk of Susan�s scarf on my eyes, once again plunging me 

into darkness.&nbsp; After a few seconds, I had the same feeling as earlier, that the removal of my sense of sight had 

worked to heighten my other senses, and I could hear every movement they made.&nbsp; I could also smell the female 

arousal as they stood near me, and I was convinced at this stage that it was all three of them I was smelling.



�Okay, Bob, come down off that couch.�&nbsp; I began to ease back off of my knees to stand, and as I did, I felt a 

hand reach for my upper arm to steady me.&nbsp; I stood up, grateful to have the pressure off of my knees.&nbsp; �Okay, 

follow me,� Susan said, and I felt a gentle push on my back as the other hand continued to guide me by my 

upper arm.&nbsp; I was very aware of the butt plug Susan had shoved up my ass, and was careful to keep my ass 

muscles clenched as I walked so as not to lose it.



I walked forward, and judging from where I had been standing, I figured we must have been heading for the 

bedroom.&nbsp; I heard three pairs of footsteps following alongside and just behind me.&nbsp; After walking about ten 

steps, Susan said, �Okay, stop, and now stand there.�



I halted, and I felt hands on my upper body.&nbsp; I realized that somebody was taking off my shirt, feeling the 

sleeves pulled down off of my arms, rendering me totally naked in front of the three women.&nbsp; 



After the person, presumably Susan, pulled away, I heard the sound of whispering.&nbsp; Even with the blindfold on, 

though, I could not hear what was being said, and there were no giggles or other reactions from the other two 

women to betray what was said.&nbsp; But then I heard the soft rustling of more clothing, and I suspected that they 

too were getting undressed.



After a few more moments, Susan spoke once more. �Okay Bob, we�re going to help you get on the bed, lying 

on your back.� I now felt arms on either side of me, guiding me forward, until I felt my lower legs hit the bed.&nbsp; I 

kneeled on to it, and crawled forward until I figured I must have been near the head, and turned around to lie 

on my back.&nbsp; As I eased myself down, I felt my head resting on what felt like two or three pillows stacked on 

top of one another, so that I was horizontal on the bed, but was in fact propped up quite a ways.&nbsp; I was grateful 

to be lying on my back, knowing that that would help keep the butt plug in with less effort.



I heard more whispering and then heard the women walking around in the room a bit.&nbsp; It sounded like one of 

them had walked out of the room.&nbsp; �Well Bob,� Susan started up again.&nbsp; �You did pretty well on the last test we 

gave you, so we don�t need to punish you anymore. Not yet, at least.�&nbsp; I breathed a silent sigh of relief, because 

as I had lied down on the bed I was aware not just of the butt plug but also of the feel of the bedspread on my 

still sore ass cheeks, from where I had been spanked.



�See, you�re not going to be punished more, but we do still have a little bit of training to do.&nbsp; As we said, you 

still need to learn the proper, respectful way to treat a woman, and I�m not yet convinced that you understand 

everything you need to do.&nbsp; I�ve discussed this with Sarah, and she agrees there are some things that you are not 

quite as good at.&nbsp; She acknowledged to me that you are a good lover, but you can still stand to learn a few 

things.&nbsp; So the three of us are going to help you with that.&nbsp; Okay Bob?� she asked.



�Yes, Mistress Susan,� I responded, hoping that if I cooperated and played along this would be the end of it all.



�Good, so glad to have your acquiescence,� Susan responded.&nbsp; I heard the footsteps of somebody walking back 

into the room.&nbsp; �But we have a little problem, here.&nbsp; I enjoyed seeing Bob so aroused before ladies, when my 

graduate student was plunging her finger in and out of Bob�s subbie little ass.�&nbsp; I cringed at the memory.&nbsp; �And 

I thought that the butt plug would keep him in a state of arousal, but it�s obviously not doing the trick,� she 

continued.&nbsp; �Laura, get up there, sweetie, and see if you can�t help him out a little bit.&nbsp; And Bob, don�t get so 

aroused that you even think about cumming � you need to remember that I control that, right?�



�Yes, ma�am,� I answered in a soft voice.



I had no idea what she was going to do, but I felt somebody getting on the bed near me.&nbsp; I felt a hand on my 

cock, which just as Susan had pointed out, had gotten flaccid again.&nbsp; The hand � presumably Laura�s � began to 

gently stroke it, but just as it was starting to get hard again, Susan said in a sharp voice, �Wait a minute � stop.�&nbsp; 

As she spoke, I felt the hand removed and my semi-erect cock flopped back to my belly.&nbsp; �I have a better idea � 

why don�t you do that yourself, Bob � no need for Laura to waste the effort,� she said with a chuckle.



I felt Laura sit back away from me, but still on the bed, and I realized quickly what Susan expected of me.&nbsp; She 

wanted me to touch myself, exposed to these three women, while they watched.&nbsp; Once again, with the hope that 

it would soon be over, I realized I had to comply.&nbsp; Normally, the idea of touching myself in front of three 

women like that would be erotic, but not in this setting where I had no control and was doing so only because 

of being forced to by this domineering woman.



I sighed, and reached my hand over and began to touch my cock. After a few strokes, it had sprung to life, and 

after just a few more it had returned to the state it had been earlier when I was bent over the couch and Laura 

was fingering me.&nbsp; I stopped, and put my hand back at my side, my cock now pointed upward.



�Oh no, Bob, don�t stop,� Susan said, �we want to see you continue that, don�t we ladies?&nbsp; But remember, not 

too far, or you�ll be punished again.�&nbsp; I couldn�t see, of course, but I presumed that Sarah and Laura nodded in 

agreement.&nbsp; They appeared to be going along with everything Susan wanted, even though I still carried some 

hope that Sarah would come to her senses and call a halt to the whole thing and get me out of there.



With no other choice, I reached over and began to lightly stroke my cock again.&nbsp; It did feel good, even in that 

humiliating setting, though I knew I was nowhere near cumming.&nbsp; After continuing for a few minutes. I heard 

whispering again, and I felt Laura (at least I presumed it was still Laura) shifting on the bed.&nbsp; And then I felt a 

cold liquid on the tip of my cock and my hands, and I realized it must have been more of the lube that one of 

the three of them had earlier retrieved from the other room.



I felt the bed stir again, and sensed somebody close to my head.&nbsp; I then heard Sarah�s voice whispering in my 

ear, �Feels good, Bob, doesn�t it?� And I realized it must have been her who had poured the lube on me.



I didn�t reply, but just continued to stroke my cock.&nbsp; Yes, it did feel good, but I still did not like being forced to 

do this in front of the three of them.&nbsp; Sarah was still sitting next to me on the bed, with Laura over on the other 

side.



I continued a couple of more minutes, and felt myself getting more aroused.&nbsp; Just as I thought I was getting 

close, Susan must have sensed this, because she said, �Okay, Bob, that�s enough for now.&nbsp; We just wanted to 

get you plenty aroused so you�d have your senses heightened for the remainder of your training.� I stopped 

touch myself, my cock still pointing toward the ceiling.&nbsp; Hearing the word �remainder,� I had a glimmer of hope 

that perhaps we were approaching the end of the torment I had been experiencing.



�Okay Laura, you first,� Susan said.&nbsp; I didn�t know what she meant, but I heard Laura shifting around and 

moving on the bed.&nbsp; She apparently knew what to do, so this must have been what the whispering was about 

earlier.&nbsp; I also felt Sarah shifting around a bit on the other side of me, but she just moved a little bit away but I 

could still feel her weight on the bed next to me.



And then I felt Laura on top of me, straddling my chest.&nbsp; I felt no clothes on her, so I realized she must have 

disrobed when I heard the rustling of clothes after my shirt had been removed.&nbsp; And there was no question what 

I smelled � a woman�s wet pussy in a high state of arousal.&nbsp; 



She was sitting on my chest, about halfway between my head and my cock, and I waited expectantly for her to 

shift forward bringing her pussy in contact with my mouth.&nbsp; I assumed Susan was going to have me service her 

orally as part of my �training.�



But there I waited a few seconds, with Laura astride me, making no apparent moving at scooting forward.&nbsp; I 

didn�t know what to do, so I just lie there, waiting.&nbsp; Finally, Susan spoke.&nbsp; �Okay, Bob, here�s your task.&nbsp; 

You�re going to be trained to worship women, to treat them with all the respect they deserve, demonstrating to 

us that you understand our position of dominance over you lowly men.&nbsp; You are going to show us how well you 

can pleasure us, putting our gratification above your own.&nbsp; Only through this kind of training will you learn how 

to properly respect women, putting them � and their needs, desires, and yes, even their careers � ahead of your 

own.&nbsp; It is this discipline that you must learn.&nbsp; Do you understand, pet?�



I couldn�t respond at first, just shocked at what she was doing.&nbsp; I was not surprised that she was using me in 

this way given where things had been heading, but the way she was framing it � that my being used as a �sex 

toy� to bring pleasure to a woman � was a way of getting me to properly respect and acknowledge women�s 

dominance over men was unexpected.&nbsp; I heard her say in a slightly louder voice, �I asked you a question, Bob.&nbsp; I 

want an answer.�



I started for a second at the sound of her voice, and pulled myself together.&nbsp; �Yes, ma�am, I understand,� I 

responded, knowing what she was expecting to hear.



�Not good enough, Bob.&nbsp; I want you to tell me � no, tell us � what it is you understand.�



I hesitated for a second, trying to make sure I did in fact understand what she was saying.&nbsp; After gathering my 

thoughts, I replied, �I understand that the purpose of this training is for me to learn how women are superior to 

men.&nbsp; That I need to put them first, before men.&nbsp; Is that correct, Professor Bascom?�



She laughed, and said, �Good enough, my pet.&nbsp; I think you get the gist of it.&nbsp; Okay, Laura, you may begin.�&nbsp; 

And with that I felt Laura scoot forward until I felt her pussy hair tickling my chin.&nbsp; Unlike Susan, who I had 

learned in the hotel bathroom two nights ago was shaven clean, and Sarah, who usually trimmed her pussy hair, 

Laura was quite bushy and her hairs quickly brushed my nose.&nbsp; It became quickly apparent to me that she had in 

fact been aroused by what had occurred, because I immediately got a strong whiff of her arousal as her crotch 

approached my face.&nbsp; 



I opened my mouth, prepared to service her orally.&nbsp; As I did, she scooted forward just a bit, almost enveloping 

my nose and mouth with her pussy.&nbsp; Her arousal that had been signaled by her scent was confirmed by the 

wetness that I immediately felt all over my lower face.&nbsp; I began to softly lick her labia, first the large outer ones, 

then the smaller inner ones.&nbsp; I worked on one side, and then the other, lightly licking and stroking them with my 

tongue.&nbsp; Every now and then, I felt Laura shift around a bit, seeming to try to get better contact between her 

pussy and my face.



After a few moments of this, I felt a hand on my cock again.&nbsp; It had stayed erect, being fueled by the erotic 

sensation of licking Laura.&nbsp; I&nbsp; had to admit it was not unpleasant, and tasting, feeling, and smelling how aroused 

she was was also turning me on.&nbsp; The hand was lightly stroking my cock, a very nice feeling.&nbsp; I couldn�t tell if it 

was Laura, reaching behind her, or one of the other women.



I was brought out of my reverie by Susan�s voice in my ear.&nbsp; Somehow she had gotten so close, and I hadn�t 

even realized it.&nbsp; �Remember, Bob � you may not cum, or you will be punished again.�&nbsp; I couldn�t respond, of 

course, with my mouth being totally consumed by Laura�s pussy, but Susan had to have known I heard her.&nbsp; I 

tried to put out of my mind what the hand was doing to me, but it was very difficult. I was really concentrating 

on my tongue and lips pleasuring Laura, but still, I felt my own arousal growing.&nbsp; And then it stopped � just like 

that, it was gone, and I was left once again with my cock aiming skyward.



I continued licking Laura, now starting to move my tongue more deeply into her pussy.&nbsp; Her folds felt very 

smooth, and her taste was not unpleasant. I tried to reach the sides of her vagina as best I could, and she 

continued to shift around a bit.&nbsp; Her wetness seemed to be increasing, so I suspect that my ministrations were 

having the desired effect.



I then pulled&nbsp; my tongue out of her pussy and reached upward to flick it over her clit, which was not hard to 

find.&nbsp; It was quite prominent and was sticking way out of its hood, which appeared to have retracted some to 

provide me easy access to the clit.&nbsp; As I did this for a minute or so, she began to rock up and down on my face, 

and I suspected that she was getting close to an orgasm.&nbsp; I could hear her breathing getting heavier, and she was 

rocking faster, and I did my best to maintain contact with her clit, even though my tongue was getting very 

tired.&nbsp; Just as I thought she was ready to explode, I heard Susan say in a gentle but firm voice, �That�s enough, 

pet, now get off of him.�



Laura groaned, still continuing to rock on my face.&nbsp; �Please, Mistress, I am so close, please let me cum.�



�No, pet, you know the rule � you only come when I give you permission when we are together.&nbsp; And you too 

need to learn the proper discipline if you are going to grow into a woman who can use her influence over men.&nbsp; 

So get off of him right now, my dear, and return to your spot on the bed.�



I heard Laura sigh, and felt her ease off of my face, leaving me covered in her secretions.&nbsp; She had been so wet 

that it was literally dripping down my cheeks in little rivulets.&nbsp; As she got up, I felt a soft kiss on my cheek, and 

she whispered in my ear, �You were very good,� and giggled a bit before I felt her sitting again by my side on 

the bed.



�Okay, Bob, catch your breath,� I heard Susan say.&nbsp; I had been breathing very heavily from the exertion and 

from the weight of Laura on my chest, so I tried my best to catch my breath.&nbsp; I felt some kind of cloth on my 

face, sopping up Laura�s wetness that had been deposited there.&nbsp; It must have been Sarah doing that.



I lie there for what seemed like two or three minutes, nothing happening.&nbsp; Then I felt Sarah on the other side of 

me getting up, and she too plopped herself down on my chest.&nbsp; I hadn�t heard anything, so Susan must have 

given her some kind of silent signal.&nbsp; But then I heard her voice once more, �Okay, Bob, you know what to do,� 

and with that, Sarah scooted forward on to my face.



This was a much more familiar sensation to me, of course.&nbsp; Sarah�s trimmed pussy fit right over my mouth, in a 

position I had certainly been in before.&nbsp; While this was not something we did frequently, she did like to sit on 

my face like this when we played around with dominance and submission.&nbsp; It was one of her favorite ways of 

having me service her; she had told me that there was something about towering over me, trapping my head 

between her thighs, that made her feel very superior and dominant.&nbsp; I don�t know if Susan had gotten this idea 

from Sarah, or whether she had come up with it on her own, but in any event I began using my tongue on my 

wife�s pussy.



Knowing Sarah as I did, it did not take very long for her to get going.&nbsp; She had not been nearly as aroused as 

had Laura, judging from the difference in how wet she was compared to the graduate student when each had 

mounted my face.&nbsp; But Sarah quickly caught up as my tongue got to work.&nbsp; I took one of her outer labia 

between my lips and started to gently suck on it, something that I knew drove her wild.&nbsp; I repeated on the other, 

and then ran my tongue all around each of her inner lips.&nbsp; She was getting wetter and wetter, and she too began 

to move around.&nbsp; Unlike Laura, though, who rocked up and down, Sarah was moving in more of a circular 

motion, almost like she was rubbing her pussy all over my face.



As I worked my tongue on her labia, I heard her breathing get heavy and heard her say, �Yes, that is so good, 

give it to me Bob.�&nbsp; I knew she was getting close, and wondered if Susan was going to stop her, too, before she 

orgasmed.&nbsp; I knew what was going to bring her over the top, and went right for it.&nbsp; I pushed my neck up a bit so 

that I could get my lips around her clit, and began to suck on it.&nbsp; This had the expected effect, and she began to 

moan even louder, �Yes, yes, yes, that�s it.�&nbsp; I waited for Susan to stop her, but not hearing anything, continued 

sucking her clit even harder.&nbsp; And then it hit � a huge orgasm, as she ground her pussy on my face, shaking 

violently, her juices running all over it.&nbsp; As she came down, I eased up on the sucking, just the way that I knew 

she liked, and after 30 seconds or so her body stopped shaking and she rolled off of me.&nbsp; �Oh god,� was all she 

could say.



Susan laughed, and said, �Well, it looked like you certainly enjoyed that, my dear!&nbsp; I�d say your husband is 

doing a good job learning just how to take care of a woman, aren�t you Bob?�&nbsp; I had been wiping my wife�s 

wetness off of the lower half of my face with the back of my hand, and managed to mumble, �Yes, ma�am.�



Susan laughed again, and I felt hands around the top of my head, and the scarf was lifted off of it.&nbsp; My eyes 

were shocked by the light, even though the room was lit by just a rather dim lamp over in one corner, and I 

blinked a few times trying to recover from it.&nbsp; After a bit, I was able to look around and take in the sights 

around me.&nbsp; There was enough light to allow me to see that on one side of me on the bed was my wife, curled 

up, still breathing heavily, with what I could see was a very wet pussy.&nbsp; I turned the other way, and there was 

Laura, the graduate student sitting naked and cross-legged looking over at Sarah.&nbsp; I saw for the first time 

tonight her very bushy pussy that fifteen minutes ago I had been licking to abandon.&nbsp; 



And standing at the foot of the bed was Susan, but unlike the other two, she was wearing the silk dressing 

gown in which she had greeted me what seemed like hours earlier.&nbsp; I suspected that her remaining clothed, at 

least partially so, while the other two women were naked, was part of the power play for her.



She moved forward, and kneeled on the bed at my feet.&nbsp; She leaned forward, reached out and put her hand on 

my cock, and began to lightly stroke it.&nbsp; It had been almost fully at attention while I was licking my wife, but 

Susan�s touch brought it even more so.



�I can see you are enjoying your training, aren�t you, pet,� she said, looking me in the eye.&nbsp; I could do nothing 

but nod, knowing that any other response would be interpreted as a lie given the state of my erection. I then 

realized this wouldn�t suffice, and said, �Yes, Professor Bascom.�



�I thought so,� she replied, �because like most men ultimately what you want is to please a woman.&nbsp; I agree 

you�ve been learning to do that very, very well, my little subbie.&nbsp; And you�ll be happy to hear that your training 

is almost over.�



Given what she said, and what had transpired, I suspected that my denouement would be to perform the same 

acts on her.&nbsp; That would fit right in with the entire evening, with her orchestrating of the events right from the 

beginning.&nbsp; In fact, it would fit right in with everything she had done to me ever since she had first caught me 

spying on her and Laura in the bathroom two nights earlier.



She continued to lightly stroke my cock, gazing back and forth at the two other women with a wry smile on her 

face.&nbsp; I was getting even more aroused, and was doing everything I could to stop from cumming.&nbsp; Susan looked 

at Laura and said to her, �How about you, poor pet � you were pretty aroused grinding your sweet little pussy 

on Professor Arnold�s face, weren�t you?�&nbsp; This reminder of my servitude to her, along with Susan�s coarse, 

humiliating language to describe it, led to a deflation of my erection just a bit.&nbsp; It must have been a little 

humiliating for Laura, also, because she looked down at her hands as she answered, �Yes, ma�am, I was � or 

should say, am, very aroused.�



�And I always take care of you, don�t I, pet,� Susan replied to her.



�Yes, Professor Bascom, you do take care of me.�



�Well, then I won�t leave you hanging there, sweetie,� and I thought Susan was going to tell her to mount 

herself on my face once again.&nbsp; But to my surprise, she said to her, �You can go ahead and touch yourself.�



I was shocked by this response, but Laura, much to my surprise, did not appear shocked at all.&nbsp; She simply said, 

�Thank you, Mistress,� and proceed to spread her legs out, lowered her right hand, and began to stroke it in and 

out of her still-wet pussy.&nbsp; There was no sound in the room other than the squishing noise as Laura pistoned her 

finger in and out of her pussy.



I surmised from Laura�s response that this must have been part of their routine, that as Laura�s Mistress, Susan 

probably made her touch herself to orgasm quite frequently.&nbsp; I looked over on my other side, and saw that Sarah 

had apparently recovered from her crashing orgasm, was breathing more normally, and had now propped herself 

up on one elbow to watch the action unfolding.&nbsp; Her gaze was glued to Laura as the young graduate student 

added first a second, and then a third finger to her first and began pushing all three in and out of her pussy. 



It did not take long before Laura�s breathing quickened and I could see she would orgasm soon.&nbsp; I had clearly 

brought her to the brink, and the little bit of work she was now doing to touch herself would get her over the 

edge.&nbsp; With a loud, �Ohhhhhhh,� she came, the wetness of her pussy now gushing over the bedspread, leaving a 

large wet spot between her legs.&nbsp; She fell over, exhausted, on her side in a similar position to which Sarah had 

been just a few minutes earlier.



Susan walked over to that side of the bed, and reached down and began lightly stroking Laura�s hair.&nbsp; �There 

you go, pet, wasn�t that nice,� she said to her in a soothing voice. 



As Laura was able to catch her breath, she responded, �Yes, Mistress, thank you so much.�



�You know I always take care of you, don�t you my dear.�



�Yes, ma�am,� Laura said, still somewhat in a halted voice.



Susan now looked over at me, not saying a word.&nbsp; I looked over at her, not sure what would be happening next, 

somewhat curious, but also apprehensive.&nbsp; She reached down, and undid the tie holding her silk robe together.&nbsp; 

It fell open, displaying for me once again her shaved pussy and full breasts.&nbsp; Even in the dim light of the room I 

could see that her arousal was demonstrated by her nipples, which were standing at attention.&nbsp; It was clear that 

she had been enjoying the events that had been taking place.



She shrugged the robe off of her shoulders, and walked over and placed it on a chair in the bedroom of the 

suite.&nbsp; She walked around to the side of the bed where Sarah was, leaned down and whispered something in her 

ear.&nbsp; Sarah shifted around toward the foot of the bed, making a space for Susan where she had just been.&nbsp; Susan 

sat on the bed, and reached over and again began lightly stroking my cock.&nbsp; It quickly grew erect again, for 

what seemed like the tenth time tonight.&nbsp; She continued this for a couple of minutes until Laura was able to 

recover from her orgasm, and was able to sit up once again.&nbsp; She watched what Susan was doing with rapt 

attention, as was Sarah, from where she was seated on the foot of the bed.



Susan turned to me and said, �Okay, pet, you�ve done very well so far.&nbsp; Are you now ready for the final part of 

your training?�



�Yes, Mistress Susan,� I replied, looking her in the eye.



�Good, I hope that this last activity will provide you with a clear understanding of your role with respect to 

women.&nbsp; After all, that was the purpose of all this, right?�



�Yes, ma�am.�



She smiled at me, and proceeded to get up on her knees next to me on the bed.&nbsp; She then, like the others, kicked 

a leg over my chest and began to straddle me.&nbsp; Knowing the drill, I prepared for her to sit on my face like the 

others had done, closed my eyes in anticipation of the event one more time, and waited.&nbsp; I felt Susan scoot 

forward a bit and pull herself up off of my chest just a little bit, and I got my tongue ready.&nbsp; But then she 

stopped.



�Open your eyes, pet, and look at me.�



Not sure she was talking to me rather than Laura, I nevertheless opened them again.&nbsp; She was looking down at 

me from above, her shaved pussy only two inches or so from my face, hanging over my upper chest.&nbsp; I waited in 

anticipation, guessing that part of her mind game was to make sure I watched her pussy coming down on my 

face.&nbsp; �Don�t take your eyes off of me,� she said.



I did as instructed, looking at her without blinking, holding my breath.&nbsp; And then she began to rise off of me, 

kicking her leg over to the side, and for a moment, I thought maybe she had relented and decided I had had 

enough.&nbsp; I let out a breath, thinking that my ordeal was over.



But then instead of stopping, she continued her rotation 180 degrees, so that she was now straddling me again.&nbsp; 

But this time, she was facing toward my feet (and Sarah at the end of the bed).&nbsp; Instead of her pussy being 

inches from my face, it was her round, plump ass cheeks that were sitting on my upper chest.&nbsp; I stared at them, 

as the realization began to sink in as to what was going to happen.&nbsp; She was so close that I could not take in the 

whole sight in one view; I had to swivel my head a bit to look at one cheek, and then the other, split down the 

middle by her crack which started four or five inches or so above my chest and went down, disappearing 

somewhere in the middle of my chest.



�I told you to look at me,� I heard Susan hiss, grabbing my attention back.&nbsp; I looked up at the sound of her 

voice, and saw her looking back over her shoulder at me.&nbsp; �You better do a good job, as good as you did with 

the other two, or we�re going to be staying right here for a long, long time.&nbsp; Now get started.�



Before I could say anything, she lifted up her ass, scooted back so that her crack was right above my mouth, 

and plopped down right on my lips.&nbsp; For a brief second I thought she was going to suffocate me, as I was taking 

the full weight of her upper body on my mouth and covering my nose.&nbsp; But then she lifted up a bit and I 

realized she was getting herself settled down on top of me, supporting most of her weight on her knees and 

thighs.



I hesitated for a second, never having been in this situation before.&nbsp; In all of our dominance and submission 

sessions, Sarah had never made me do this to her.&nbsp; Yes, I had performed cunnilingus on her many times, but I 

had never been forced to lick her ass.&nbsp; I didn�t know what to expect; like most, I had the taboo of this being a 

dirty, forbidden part of the body.&nbsp; But I knew from Susan�s tone, and from everything else that had happened, 

that my ordeal would not be over until I submitted to her demand.



The olfactory sensation was different from the other two women.&nbsp; I definitely smelled Susan�s arousal when she 

first sat down facing me, a scent I had experienced before in the last two days.&nbsp; But now that she was turned 

around, her pussy facing away from me, the aroma was a different one.&nbsp; There was just a hint of her pussy, 

overwhelmed by a stronger, muskier odor that I knew was emanating from the rear part of her body.&nbsp; It was not 

disgusting me, it was just different.



I tentatively opened my mouth, and extended my tongue, and began to lightly lick one of her ass cheeks.&nbsp; It was 

smooth, covered with a very soft, downy hair, quite different from when I licked her pussy, the outside of 

which was rougher and just barely stubbly from having been shaved or waxed some time earlier.&nbsp; I continued 

licking around her cheek, as far as I could reach, given that I could only partially swivel my head as she had me 

effectively pinned.&nbsp; It was too big to reach all of it, at least from this position, but I did the best I could running 

both the tip and flat part of my tongue around her cheek, depositing some saliva where I went.&nbsp; Every now and 

then she shifted around a bit, providing me an opportunity reach parts of the cheek I had not yet explored.



After a few minutes of this, I shifted my attention to the other cheek, repeating the pattern.&nbsp; In all of this I 

avoided getting too close to her crack, which I could see had somewhat darker, heavier hairs on it from the top 

down to where it disappeared on top of my chest.&nbsp; She again shifted around, providing me with the opportunity 

to run my tongue all over her cheek again.&nbsp; As I did this, she began to stroke my cock, getting it fully erect once 

more.



After a few minutes on this side, she scooted down toward my feet, and I thought perhaps it would be over.&nbsp; 

She looked over her should again, down at me.&nbsp; �Very good, my little subbie boy.&nbsp; But there�s still more for you 

to do,� she said with a wry smile on her face.&nbsp; With that she stopped stroking me, and bent her body further 

forward, so that her large breasts were down around my knees, and she scooted back toward my face.&nbsp; This had 

the effect of splitting her two cheeks a bit, and bringing my face directly in contact with the crack of her ass.&nbsp; 

She left no doubt in my mind as to what she now wanted me to do.&nbsp; She didn�t need to say anything else.



I again opened my mouth, and with my tongue, tentatively reached out and touched the top of her crack, which 

I could just reach in the position she was in.&nbsp; I ran it up and down the part of her crack I could feel, the musky 

scent surrounding my face, an intoxicating aroma enveloping me.&nbsp; As I did this, and realizing that the taste was 

not unpleasant, I pressed a little harder, leaving a little more saliva as lubrication as my tongue continued its 

travel up one side of the crack and down the other.



She then lifted up off of my chest a bit more, causing me to stop what I was doing, and giving my tongue a 

respite.&nbsp; She then shifted back even further, and there, right in front of me, was her wrinkled rosebud.&nbsp; The skin 

was redder than the rest of her ass, a star pattern, the size of a nickel or so, right in front of me, glistening with 

the combination of my saliva that had run down her crack, and, I suspected, her own juices from her pussy that 

had run back there.&nbsp; I realized this was where she had been heading all night, the ultimate part of my training: 

forcing me to service her ass with my tongue.&nbsp; I opened my mouth once again, extended my tongue, and 

touched it gently to her rosebud.&nbsp; The sensation was what I expected, given its appearance; it was wrinkly, yet 

soft.



I began by running the tip of my tongue in a circular motion around the ring, getting it even wetter.&nbsp; As I did 

this I thought I heard an imperceptible sigh emanating from her face which was pressed down on my legs.&nbsp; I 

continued the circling, and as I did, the rosebud began to loosen up and give way slightly.&nbsp; This emboldened me 

to push toward it with the tip of my tongue, and as I did, it opened up further, allowing just a slight bit of entry.&nbsp; 

As I did this, Susan pushed back against me just a bit, making it easier for me to push harder.&nbsp; I did so, and I 

could feel my tongue gaining more entry into her now very wet asshole.



There was definitely more than just a muted sigh coming from Susan now, it was more like a moan.&nbsp; It was clear 

she was enjoying what I was doing, so I hoped that if I continued she would eventually orgasm and get off of 

me.&nbsp; My tongue was getting quite sore from all the pushing I was doing, but she didn�t seem ready to relent, at 

least not yet.&nbsp; I kept extending my tongue into her ass and retracting it, trying to roll it around a bit when it was 

in her asshole.&nbsp; The wetter it got, the easier this was, and the more she was pushing back against me.&nbsp; Her moans 

picked up, keeping pace with the rocking of her plump ass against my face, until finally, she let out a wail and 

yelled, �PUSH IT IN DEEP!�



I did as she told, pushing with all my might, rolling it around inside of her asshole, and finally, she came with a 

hard grunt, riding my face and tongue.&nbsp; I did my best to hold on as she rocked rapidly back and forth, until she 

began to slow down, and then stopped, leaning back forward again, her body heaving up and down as her 

breathing slowed.&nbsp; I gladly retracted my tongue, giving it the break it so sorely needed.



After a few moments, Susan lifted herself up, and turned 180 degrees again, so that she was straddling me but 

now facing me.&nbsp; She looked down at me, and with a smile, said, �See pet, you�ve learned how to truly please a 

woman.&nbsp; I think you now understand your role in life, that you are here to keep women happy and to make sure 

they are pleasured.&nbsp; Don�t you?�



Utterly defeated, I nodded and simply said, �Yes, Mistress,� happy to have the ordeal apparently over.



As Susan climbed off of me, she sat next to me on the bed.&nbsp; She reached over and wrapped her hand around my 

cock, which was still quite erect.&nbsp; She looked at me, and smiling again, said, �But look, your pretty little subbie 

cock is still sticking up in the air, isn�t it?�&nbsp; She turned toward Sarah and Laura, and asked them, �What do you 

think we should do about it, ladies?�



They both giggled, Sarah saying, �Whatever you think, Professor Bascom.&nbsp; You�re the Mistress!�&nbsp; Laura simply 

shrugged her shoulders, indicating concurrence with what Sarah had said.



�Well, pet, we simply can�t having you walking around like this, now can we?&nbsp; Tell you what � you�ve done 

such a good job servicing the three of us, you deserve a little bit of that reward I talked about earlier.&nbsp; You even 

managed to get me off simply by sticking that wonderful tongue of yours right up my dirty ass.&nbsp; You didn�t 

even have to touch my pussy you were so good.�&nbsp; With that, she got up on her knees, and threw one leg over 

me, straddling me once again and facing me this time.&nbsp; I thought maybe she was going to have me lick her pussy 

now, but instead of shifting forward, she instead lifted herself up a bit, moved back, and plopped her very wet 

pussy right on top of my erect cock which had been sticking straight up.



To say I was shocked was an understatement.&nbsp; I didn�t think there was any way she was going to do that, and 

yet there she was, sitting right on top of my cock.&nbsp; And she then began lifting up and down on it, the feeling of 

her wet, fully aroused pussy on my cock admittedly quite nice.&nbsp; I knew it was not going to take long to cum 

with all the stimulation I had had, so I lay back, closed my eyes, and waited for my orgasm to approach.



But after about 30 seconds of this, Susan surprised me by lifting herself off of me, saying as she did so, �There, 

that should be enough I would think.�&nbsp; I had no clue what she was doing, so I opened my eyes, looking up into 

hers.



�You didn�t think I was going to let you fuck me, did you, my pet?�



I was speechless for a second, but then managed to begin to mumble something about how I thought that�s 

what she was doing.



�Oh no,� she replied, �I was simply getting it nice and lubricated for you.&nbsp; You�re going to get yourself off 

while we three women watch you.�



I opened my mouth to say something, but couldn�t find the words to respond to what she had just said.&nbsp; I 

simply lay there, my mouth open, stunned beyond belief at this final humiliation she was doling out to me.



�C�mon now, get to it before my lubrication dries up on you,� she chuckled.



I could do nothing other than reach down with my hand, and begin stroking.&nbsp; She had gotten it very wet with 

her pussy juice, and my hand rode easily up and down the shaft.&nbsp; I looked down past my cock and I could see 

Sarah watching intently.&nbsp; I could see Susan next to her, watching also, with a broad smile on her face.&nbsp; Out of 

the corner of my eye I could see Laura on the other side, also watching.



�That�s right, keep going,� Susan urged me on.&nbsp; �Isn�t he doing a great job wanking himself for us, ladies?� 



Again, the other two just laughed and continued to watch.&nbsp; I continued the up and down motion, and I knew 

that in spite of everything that had happened, that I would cum soon.&nbsp; And I would be happy to, hoping that 

that would close the door on this torment.&nbsp; Up and down I continued, willing my orgasm to come, and finally it 

did, my cum spurting up in the air, depositing itself all over my hand and my stomach, as I grunted through it.



I heard Susan clap her hands and exclaim, �See, I knew he could do it.&nbsp; Professor Arnold has now learned that 

his job is to bring pleasure to women, and if he wants any of his own, it�s up to him to provide it.&nbsp; Right, pet?�&nbsp; 

She tossed me the towel that had been on the bed and had been used previously to wipe my face.



I glared at her as I wiped the cum off of my hand and stomach.



�That�s okay, pet, you don�t have to respond.�&nbsp; And with a wink, she turned to the other two and said, �I know 

he gets it now.�



With that she got up, retrieved her robe and put it back on.&nbsp; She turned back to me and said, �Put your clothes 

on, Bob, and take Sarah back to your room.&nbsp; Laura, go get yourself cleaned up and then come on back here.�



I got up, as did Sarah.&nbsp; I yanked the butt plug out of my ass, depositing it on the bed.&nbsp; Sarah put her clothes on, 

and I retrieved mine, putting them on in the living room of the suite.&nbsp; We headed toward the door to the hall, 

and after Sarah walked out into the hall, Susan came out of the bedroom and said, �Bye, Bob.&nbsp; I hope you 

enjoyed all the mentoring I�ve provided you.�



Without looking back at her, I walked out the door, closed it, and led Sarah back to my room.
