Call 1.   
'Hello?'   
'For God sakes,
    Carmen, what are you playing at?'   
'Edward, darling,
    how terribly good of you to call, I was just thinking about you&hellip;'   
'How could
    you do this?'   
'I'm afraid
    I'm not sure&hellip;'   
'You know
    perfectly well! Don't play the sweet innocent one with me!'   
'Edward, have
    you had breakfast? You sound terribly grumpy.'   
'Grumpy? Of
    course I'm fucking grumpy! You put this&hellip;thing&hellip;whatever it's
    called&hellip;on me when I was asleep...'   
'It's called
    a chastity tube, darling and I believe it's rather effective. Is it effective?   
'What?'   
'Can your
    thingy get hard, darling?'   
'Well&hellip;no&hellip;'   
'So it  is   rather
    effective, just as the man in the shop told me when I purchased it.'   
'I want it
    off!'   
'I'm sure
    you do. I'd love to chat some more but I'm afraid I have a marketing meeting
    I must attend&hellip;'   
'Carmen!'   
'Edward, I
    must tell you I do not care for that tone of voice at all. I find it rather
    rude and obviously discourteous.'   
'Carmen&hellip;I
    need&hellip;'   
'Goodbye Edward.'   
Call 2.   
'Hello?'   
'Carmen, please.
    It's been two days&hellip;'   
'Edward, how
    pleasant to hear your voice.'   
'A joke is
    a joke and we've had a good laugh but now can you&hellip;'   
'I haven't
    laughed at all, darling and I don't think you've laughed much during the
    past days, have you?'   
'No, I&hellip;'   
'In fact,
    I think you sound a tiny bit distressed. Is the office politics getting you
    down?'   
'You know
    perfectly well what's getting me down!'   
'I suggest
    you do not raise your voice to me, Edward as I find it irritating. I don't
    think you want to irritate me, do you?'   
'Carmen&hellip;'   
'Do you?'   
'No, I suppose
    I don't&hellip;'   
'That's a
    more acceptable tone, although a touch sullen, and I'm still waiting for
    an apology for your frightful behaviour the other morning.'   
'But&hellip;'   
'A gentlemen
    does not raise his voice to a lady, no matter the circumstances.'   
'I apologise
    for my tone of voice the other day but, as you must understand, I was outraged
    to wake and find this contraption&hellip;well&hellip;you know&hellip;'   
'Your vocabulary
    appears to be diminishing in conjunction with your ability to achieve an
    erection. It is rather simple actually, it's just a chastity belt.'   
'But&hellip;'   
'Say it, say
    it's a chastity belt.'   
'I'm in the
    office, my secretary might&hellip;'   
'Say it!'   
'All right,
    it's a chastity belt! '   
'Now, that
    wasn't so difficult, was it?'   
'But why did
    you do this? What&hellip;'   
'Don't you
    recall darling that you asked me to assist you in exploring your submissive
    side? Of course, I was playing with your thingy at the time so you may have
    been persuaded to agree&hellip;'   
'But why this,
    this abomination!'   
'The best
    way to dominate a man, my dear Edward is to control the thingy. It's a very
    sensible approach to domination.'   
'Carmen, I
    want this off and I want this off now!'   
'I sense you're
    becoming upset&hellip;'   
'Carmen!'   
'Goodbye Edward.'   
Call 3.   
'Miss Diaz,
    Mr Hardacre is on line three again.'   
'Please tell
    him I'm busy, Sue.'   
'He's quite
    persistent, Miss Diaz, almost begging to speak to you.'   
'Begging?'   
'Perhaps not
    exactly begging but he does sound rather desperate. Is he all right?'   
'I think the
    pressure of business is becoming a little too much for Edward. Put him through,
    please Sue.'   
'Of course,
    Miss Diaz.'   
'Edward, how
    nice of you to call&hellip;'   
'Carmen, it's
    been two weeks, please help me, please take this off.'   
'Edward, I
    hope you're not making demands on me. I abhor demands.'   
'Demands?
    No, no&hellip;of course not. I'm sorry, Carmen.'   
'Edward, I
    must compliment you on your tone of voice as it has improved dramatically.
    In fact, it has become quite pleasant, almost servile.'   
'Carmen, please&hellip;'   
'Edward, are
    you desperate? Is that small innocent metal tube causing problems?'   
'Of course
    it is! I&hellip;'   
'Now, now,
    remember who you're talking to.'   
'Of course,
    I  am   sorry.'   
'I hope that's
    not sarcasm I'm hearing in your voice, Edward?'   
'No, I really
    am sorry. Please don't hang up.'   
'Edward, you
    asked me to dominate you&hellip;'   
'But not like
    this!'   
'I know you
    wanted safe little games where I tied you up and then played with you until
    you spurt or something like that. Rather frightfully boring for me, I'm afraid.'   
'But Carmen&hellip;'   
'  Miss   Carmen,
    I think?'   
'Miss Carmen?'   
'That sounds
    a lot better and much more respectful. You see Edward; I expect a little
    more than dreadfully boring games. I expect total submission and total dependence
    and I rather think I'm going to have both from you.'   
'Me?'   
'Of course
    you! Unless you know someone else who has given control of his thingy to
    me?'   
'But Carmen&hellip;'   
'  Miss   Carmen!'   
'Sorry, Miss
    Carmen, what do I do?'   
'Do? You  do   whatever
    I want or you'll never come again.'   
'Oh my God!'   
'Don't sound
    so sad, I might let you out in a week or two, if you make me happy, of course.
    Do you want to make me happy, Edward?'   
'Yes, Miss
    Carmen.'   
'Such a sad
    voice. Be at my townhouse at precisely seven tonight. Be punctual, Edward,
    I abhor tardiness and for every minute you're late, I'll add another week
    before you get to come. Am I clear?'   
'Perfectly
    clear, Miss Carmen.'   
'Goodbye Edward.'
