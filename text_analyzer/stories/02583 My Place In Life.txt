Synopsis: A poem about the innermost desires and feelings of a submissive man in his journey to self degredation.My Place In Life 

By: sub boy roy 


Whip my asshole and spread it wide 

I need to feel pain very, very deep inside 

Quench the desire that can't be denied  

And only domination can satisfy 


&nbsp;
Once respected with children and wife 

Now being a cum sucking whore is my life 

In society proper I once had a role 

Now its cleaning cocks and dirty assholes 


&nbsp;
Remind me of my past&hellip; use it to torture me 
My mouth filled with cum is something my friends should see 

Dressed like a prostitute nothing on underneath 

You take me out looking for men on the street 


&nbsp;
My mouth you hold open for the cock of your man 

You spank me barehanded and tell me I am 

Just a bitch dog to use for your play 

You slap my face hard and I do what you say 


&nbsp;
After you fuck I lick the cum from your snatch 

Clean his cock with my mouth and worship your ass 

In a noose from the roof by my neck I am hung 

You whip my stiff cock and balls till I cum 


&nbsp;
I shoot out my cum mixed with blood on the ground 

This makes you angry so you lower me down 

To spend the rest of the evening licking it up 

Humping your friends big black cock in my butt
