(((Welcome, and I hope you enjoy this story. A way to think of the &#8216;planes&#8217; is a little like the old TV show &#8216;Sliders&#8217;. The planes are my universal story setting which allows a great variety of options for both normal and erotic stories. I will update as often as I am able. Reviews, advice and help is always welcome.)))

Episode 1 &#8211; A Brave New World


Part One


One moment they were in the dim, flickering dungeon filled with menace and evil, and then the two women were landing in an asphalt parking lot. The change, especially from the fierce sunlight, was quite dazzling.
Chesna, with more experience, had managed to land on her feet, though had stumbled slightly. Melisande though had not been expecting it, and had skinned her knees on the hot road base.
�What�where are we, Chesna?� Mel asked, bewildered.
�Yes, this is the tricky part. Are you alright?� Chesna asked. It was hard to avoid thinking about that they were both naked, had no possessions, and no idea where they were.
�I&#8217;ve had worse,� Mel said. �What is this�black rock underfoot? It&#8217;s very hot!� she said, taking steps back into the shade and a concrete sidewalk.
�It&#8217;s called asphalt. They�well, they use it like cobbles were used in the Regent&#8217;s city.� Chesna tried to find ways of explaining the situation to someone whose idea of high-tech was a watermill. �They cover roads with it,� she added.
�And what are they?� Mel asked. 
�They called cars. They&#8217;re like chariots but pulled by�magic?� Chesna said. She knew how they worked, but how did you explain it to someone more than a thousand years behind?
That explanation seemed to work though. There was a thrupping noise, and they looked up to see a massive zeppelin fly overhead. It was grey and had a large passenger compartment slung underneath.
�What�is that?� Mel asked worriedly.
�It&#8217;s an airship. I wonder where we are�and when.�
�I do not understand, Chesna. Are we near the castle?�
Chesna stepped into the shade so they wouldn&#8217;t be seen by a casual glance. �In theory we&#8217;re standing in about the same place. It&#8217;s a bit complex, but have you ever looked up at the sky at night and seen the stars?�
�Yes, of course. We followed the constellations.�
Chesna tried to find a way to explain something that confused even her. �Well, imagine all of those stars and galaxies as being one reality, and this being a parallel universe. Look, there are hundreds of &#8216;planes&#8217;, each one of them a divergence from an original, central universe. So a lot of patterns are repeated &#8211; humans, life and animals for instance. However, rates of advancement, history and conditions are all different.�
�You are right�I do not understand you,� Mel said solemnly.
Chesna gave up. Talking about plane shifting to an iron-age Amazon would take too long. �Basically, we&#8217;re in a totally different place and time, so you&#8217;ll never see the Regent again. He doesn&#8217;t exist here, right?�
�I understand,� Mel said. �Now, shall we see what clothes they wear here?�
�Yes, walking around a city naked is not a smart idea.�

They stepped out into the parking lot again, but with Chesna&#8217;s normal special dose of bad luck, they were spotted.
�Drat,� Chesna said. A car was driving in; a police car. The cars on this plane were driven by two large back wheels and two smaller wheels at the front under the drive shaft. On the side of the car was the words &#8216;Galloway Police Service: Justice, Respect, Order.&#8217;
�What do we do?� Mel asked.
�Keep walking, maybe they&#8217;ll ignore us,� Chesna said, admittedly with rather na�ve hopes. Even normal police would say something to them.
�Well, well, well. Stop there, you two,� one of the two police said. He got out of the car and sauntered over, sizing them both up. �You want to explain to me and my partner just what you&#8217;re doing walking around naked?� he asked. He had a bushy moustache and short brown hair with a suntanned face. Significantly, he had a well worn revolver at his side, and a nightstick in his hand.
Chesna didn&#8217;t know this particular rank system, but guessed the man was a sergeant. �We were looking for clothes,� Chesna said. It was usually hard fitting into a new plane, but here it was made worse. She had a long time until she could plane shift too.
�Really? Not sure why you&#8217;d want to cover up such pretty bodies. Let me put it to you; I think you&#8217;re a pair of streetwalkers. Got some ID?� the Sergeant asked. His name tag read &#8216;Sergeant Morgan.
�No, unfortunately not, officer,� Chesna replied.
�It&#8217;s in your other set of clothes?� the Sergeant jeered. �Well, I&#8217;m afraid you two are breaking the law, and I&#8217;m going to take you in for�questioning.�
Chesna sighed. Crooked cops &#8211; why did she never meet the other kind? �On what charges?�
�Indecent exposure, solicitation, and maybe a few other things. Get over here, Jenks,� he ordered.
His partner left the car and came over. �Sarge?�
�We&#8217;re taking these two for questioning. Cuff them.�

When Jenks &#8211; &#8216;Officer Jenkins&#8217; as his tag read, went to grab Mel&#8217;s wrist, she pulled her arm away.
�You want to put resisting arrest on the sheet too?� Morgan asked.
�Do as he says,� Chesna told Mel.
With bad grace, the Amazonian turned and let her wrists be tightly handcuffed behind her back. However, when Jenks started feeling her, she couldn&#8217;t help but slam her knee into his groin. The officer clutched at himself and fell to his knees. Mel was about to kick him where he knelt, but a click interrupted her.
Morgan had grabbed Chesna in a headlock, and had casually drawn his gun and cocked it. The weapons of this plane seemed to fire darts rather than bullets, but it still looked lethal. �Now get down on your knees, bitch, before I blast your head off.�
Jenks was on his feet again, a vengeful look in his eyes. �You want me to take her behind the shed?� he asked, reaching for his weapon.
�No, leave off. Knock them both out�we&#8217;ll teach them a lesson about respecting the police.�
Chesna was just wondering what he meant when Jenks put a needle into her arm. In just a minute her eyes swam and she slipped into darkness. She saw Mel get the same treatment before consciousness left her.

Mel woke rather groggily in an uncomfortable position. She was pulled up high, and could barely reach the floor. Above her, her wrists had been tightly handcuffed over a pipe so she was almost hanging. Below her, a set of ankle cuffs ran under another pipe so she was effectively helpless. She could barely move her legs without putting even more strain on her wrists. Her mouth was securely gagged with adhesive tape, and she was still naked.
�You took your time,� said Jenks, standing up from his chair. It looked like they were in a cellar somewhere, isolated and alone. Chesna was nowhere around, and that frightened Mel.
�Now, where I come from, people have a bit more respect for the badge, know what I mean? So I&#8217;m going to teach you some manners.� Jenks smirked and pulled out a long black stick.
Mel pulled desperately at her cuffs, but she could not get away. The nightstick hit her hard on the knee, making her cry out into the gag. Her stance slipped and her wrists protested as all her weight was put on them. The other knee got attention next, then he smacked her exposed toes hard enough to start tears from his captive&#8217;s eyes.
�See what it means to be a little bitch?� he asked, his hand caressing her breasts.
Mel pulled on her bonds; but the miracle of the dungeon was not repeated; these handcuffs were new and expertly made.
�Now, the Sarge doesn&#8217;t want me leaving marks�but I got plenty of toys that don&#8217;t mark.� Jenks slid his nightstick down Mel&#8217;s body until it was touching between her legs. Mel quickly shut her legs and tried to turn away. �Open your legs,� Jenks ordered.
Mel shook her head.
Jenks pulled out a small device from his pocket. At his touch, blue electricity &#8211; lightning to Mel&#8217;s eyes &#8211; danced over the surface. �You want to play hard? That&#8217;s fine, slut.�
Mel tried to pull away, but the metal contacts touched near her nipple. The shock and pain made her scream into the gag and hang in her cuffs, sobbing with the agony.
�I didn&#8217;t even have it on the full setting. Silly me,� Jenks said, playing with his device. He advanced, and ignored when Mel shook her head and tried to speak.
The next shock was indeed worse, right on the other nipple. After that, the shocks came as often as Jenks wanted. He sat straddling the lower pipe and zapped his helpless captive whenever she moved or tried to stop him.
�I could do this all day. Maybe I will.�
Mel was in agony, but this was countered somewhat by the rush of fury in her. She wanted to kick this weedy man again, and keep kicking.
�Now, open your legs,� Jenks ordered.
Mel could do nothing but obey.
�See? That was easy!� He spat on the end of his black nightstick and ran it over the entrance of Mel&#8217;s pussy. She tried to close her legs, but the taser zapped her into obedience. The stick passed into Mel&#8217;s body, and she moaned in protest at this invasion. She wasn&#8217;t ready for it, and it hurt.
�Not a virgin, huh? Tight little pussy though. Heh, have that for long.�
Helpless to stop her violation, Mel hung there and begged for it to stop.

In another room nearby, Chesna had been handcuffed to an uncomfortable bed. Her legs were secured to opposite corners so she couldn&#8217;t close her legs, while her wrists had been cuffed to the iron headboard.
�Welcome back, missy,� Morgan said, walking over. He was already naked, and quite excited by the look of it.
�Officer�you&#8217;re not going to let us go, are you?�
Morgan shook his head. �No, I don&#8217;t think we are. You might be tempted to tell strange and fanciful stories about being kidnapped by serving officers. I can&#8217;t have that.�
Chesna tried once with each cuff, and then gave up; they were very secure. �So you&#8217;re going to kills us?�
Morgan looked shocked, as though the idea was distasteful in the extreme. �Certainly not. Who do you take me for?�
Wisely, his captive said nothing.
�We&#8217;re going to�well�move things along. There&#8217;s a big demand for pretty girls. I can imagine that you&#8217;ll last longer than your friend. Jenks is having some fun with her at the moment. But I am going to have more interesting fun.
Chesna, with nothing else to do, spread her legs even wider. She&#8217;d been in this position before, and in most cases they had no intention of killing a pretty slave. Unless you meant a true psychopath you were fine. That is, if you didn&#8217;t mind being degraded and used as a sex object.
Morgan climbed onto the bed and straddled her. �I&#8217;m not an unfair man, girl. You serve me well, and I&#8217;ll even stop Jenks having his way with your friend.�
�Very well,� Chesna said, relaxing. There was nothing she could do, so she might as well at least partially enjoy herself.

Jenks had soon tired of his game, and so pulled out the slightly damp stick. �I think you&#8217;ve learned enough for today.� Then, without warning he pushed the shocker between Mel&#8217;s legs and zapped her. The gagged scream was still very loud and Mel pulled on her restraints so hard that a trickle of blood came from one abused wrist.
Her captor undid the cuffs and pushed the helpless and stunned woman to the floor. There he handcuffed her wrists behind her back and attacked one ankle to a pipe. He did not remove the gag from his captive. Then, after giving her one last cruel zap on the soles of her feet, he left the naked woman lying on the dirty floor.

With a final thrust and withdraw, Morgan pulled his cock from out of Chesna&#8217;s pussy. He let his seed out onto her stomach with a happy sigh.
�That really was quite enjoyable. If it wasn&#8217;t for my wife, I&#8217;d take you on.�
�And the fact you&#8217;re holding me here against my will, of course,� Chesna said without rancour.
�That too,� Moran replied evenly. He stood and got dressed again. �You&#8217;re taking this rather well,� he commented.
�I&#8217;ve been in this situation before. You&#8217;re a reasonable man trying to get ahead,� she lied, though since it was what her captor wanted to hear, it passed easily. �I figure if I&#8217;m just quiet then you&#8217;ve got no reason to hurt me.�
�Smart girl.�
Jenks came in, and he seemed envious that Morgan had used the opportunity to fuck Chesna while he had been torturing Mel.
�Where&#8217;s the other girl? No marks?�
�No marks. She&#8217;s in the boiler room.�
�Put this one in there too, but not so they can reach each other. Give them food and a bucket. I&#8217;ll go make contact.�

Chesna let herself be groped and handled as she was untied, and then re-cuffed and led into the pipe room. Even when Jenks stuck a finger into her pussy she made sure she remained perfectly still, fighting off the natural desire to close her legs.
It seemed that Jenks was disappointed by her lack of fight, and merely cuffed one of her ankles to a pipe and left her hands tied behind her back.
Chesna lay back as best she could with her hands under her. �Are you alright, Mel?�
There were a gagged and indignant rant from her companion.
�That&#8217;s what happens if you fight when not in a position of strength,� Chesna said.
Mel glared at her and then looked away.

A little while later Jenks came back in with some plastic dog dishes of food &#8211; cooked rice by the look of it, and a bucket to serve as a toilet. He pulled off Mel&#8217;s gag and gave her a casual, scornful kick, because walking off.
�Just wait until I get free and I will-� Mel began.
�Don&#8217;t announce it. It&#8217;ll just make them more angry.� Chesna got to her knees and quite expertly ate from her rice bowl.
�You look like you&#8217;re enjoying yourself,� Mel said bitterly.
�I am making the best of my situation. Being angry won&#8217;t get these handcuffs off, and it certainly won&#8217;t fill you up. Mel, I&#8217;ve been in this situation before, and in the circumstances, it could be worse.�
�I am not sure this is better than the dungeon we escaped from,� Mel complained.
�Of course it is &#8211; they&#8217;re going to sell us on. In the dungeon, they&#8217;d have inevitably strung you up and tortured you to death.�
�So being a concubine and slave is better than death?�
�Yes, of course it is,� Chesna said without any hesitation.
�Perhaps I do not have as much experience as you in being used by men,� Mel said acidly, and lay down again, leaving her food untouched.
Chesna sighed and finished her meal, licking every last grain up &#8211; she knew better than Mel that food was not to be sneered at as a captive.

Time passed. Possibly it was hours, but with no natural light, there was no way to tell. Finally, the door opened, and Morgan came in with Jenks.
�Bring the cases,� Morgan ordered.
Jenks returned a few moments later with coffin like boxes, but filled with straps and leather cuffs. First Chesna was untied and made to lay in the box. She was frightened, but since they could beat and force her in, it was better to get slightly comfortable. Leather straps were tightly buckled over her, and a blindfold and gag were secured over her face. She could see the limited light fade as a heavy lid was secured and padlocked shut. Thinking she&#8217;d soon suffocate, she moved her head and caught light through the blindfold from above. Many dozens of small airholes had been drilled in the box to keep the captive inside alive. Chesna tried her restraints, but she was firmly secured, and there was no escape.
Mel was a more difficult prospect, but Jenks had her measure now. So while Morgan held her still, he zapped the prisoner repeatedly, making her scream and curse.
�Give her the needle,� Morgan ordered.
Jenks sulked at his toy being taken from him, but did comply, jabbing her in the arm harder than necessary.
Mel soon sunk down into passivity and was secured.

In her box, Chesna felt herself being lifted, carried and then put inside something. A moment later there was the sound of another object, and she knew that was Mel&#8217;s prison. She struggled and pulled, but even if she had got free, the box was locked shut, and too well made to break.
The car started and they were soon driving. In her perpetual darkness of worry, Chesna soon dozed off.
She was awoken by an almighty thrashing and noise from Mel. Mel was screaming into her gag, pulling on her restraints and thumping her legs against the back of her box. Eventually she stopped when no one reacted, and sobbing could be heard.
Chesna realised that Mel might well be claustrophobic, but there was no escape from her fear.
The blonde sighed and went back to sleep.

Chesna awoke a second time as he box was lifted, then carried and set down. There was the sound of a padlock being removed and slightly brighter light filtered in through the gag. She felt the presence of people looking at her, but could not tell how many, or who they were. After a moment of muttering, her lid was slammed shut and padlocked again. Chesna had to admire their thoroughness.
Mel&#8217;s case was opened next, and there was laughter at the Amazonian, who was presumably still trying to escape. Then her lid was closed again and locked.
�So, Morgan, you bring me one pretty obedient one, and one pretty feisty one,� a voice said.
�I hope you approve, Mr Tarrant?� Morgan answered.
�Of, I do. The docile one can be in my bed while I have some fun with the feisty one. Annie likes playing with ones that struggle. How much do I owe you?� Tarrant asked.
�We agreed on fifty thousand for both, but surely we can go to sixty?� Morgan asked.
�Don&#8217;t push your luck, Morgan. Fifty-five I&#8217;m willing to go to.�
�Fine by me,� Tarrant replied. There was the sound of a pen scribbling.
�Thank you,� Morgan replied.
Chesna&#8217;s case was opened, and Morgan looked down, with Jenks behind. �Have fun, dear. I&#8217;ve persuaded Mr Tarrant to make you his bedroom girl. I know you&#8217;ll like that.�
Ever polite in situations where being rude was painful, Chesna nodded and grunted.
�Good girl.� The lid remained open so that Chesna could hear him go over and open Mel&#8217;s lid. �As for you, shape up your attitude quickly, or you&#8217;ll meet a quick end.
Mel made an outraged sound, probably resulting from Jenks having a last grope before leaving.

There was silence for a moment until a door closed, and a car could be heard leaving.
�Take their blindfolds off,� Tarrant ordered. �And the gags too.
Chesna&#8217;s was removed, and at first she was dazzled, but then saw a tall, grey haired man above her.
�I am Mr Tarrant &#8211; master or sir to you. Understand?�
�Yes, master.� Chesna was always careful to be respectful to people who could and would kill a captive without a hint of remorse.
�Good. We are going to get on well. That is, as long as you remember to obey me in all things.�
Chesna saw him go over to Mel and look down.
�Now, you can learn from your friend.�
�Yes�sir,� Mel said insolently.
�Trying to be fearless, are you? Annie will have fun with you. Get them up, put their collars on, and put them in their rooms.�

Guards appeared, unlocking Chesna and holding her painfully tight while a pair of handcuffs and leg cuffs were attached. These ones were not police issue, but padded a little, and both were connected together by a long chain so a captive could walk, just not very fast. A steel collar with a ring at the front was closed over Chesna&#8217;s throat and locked in place with a padlock behind her neck.
Mel, naturally, resisted more, but the guards sprayed something in her face, possibly pepper spray or some such weapon, and then securely bound her. With her, they had opted for tight ropes, binding her wrists, ankles, knees and elbows, then securing her wrists to a breast harness. It made Mel almost completely helpless, and much less comfortable than Chesna. As a final touch, they also handcuffed her wrists together, just for overkill. She was also blindfolded and gagged again and carried off.
Chesna, meanwhile, was allowed to walk slowly, and she did as ordered, knowing escape was not possible at the moment. Not with two guards covering her every move with guns. So, she moved through fine rooms of elegant design, past bedrooms and studies, and then down into a large cellar. There, several cells had been partitioned off with metal bars. Mel was laying on a futon like mattress, wriggling and struggling, but Chesna was pushed into a cell not next to, but opposite Mel&#8217;s.
The guards gave her food and water, and a bucket also, and then locked her cell door. Their footsteps retreated up the stairs, which was locked. Soon, there was just the light of the overhead fluorescents.
�Mel?� Chesna called.
A defiant, angry grunt came back.
�Look, I&#8217;m sorry this is happening. We will escape.�
No answer, but Mel did go back to trying to get free. Doing which would probably involve dislocating her shoulders and pulling off her hands.
�Look, Mel�I&#8217;m not leaving you behind.�
Stubborn silence as even the Amazonian gave up trying to escape.
Chesna sighed and ate some more, then laid on her on her mattress face first.
Across the hall, in her nightmare of tight ropes, Mel lay, just as helpless, but considerably more angry.
What they both felt however, was anxiety and fear of what was to come.
