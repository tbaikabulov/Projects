By Long Tall Mary
Located in the Caribbean Sea, nearly twenty miles off the coast of Venezuela, lies the tiny island of Lugash. Less than one square mile in area, it is considered to be a protectorate of the Netherlands. The legal owner is Master Cordoba, a long time kingpin in narcotics trafficking.
Of Mexican descent, the sixty year old Master is no longer active in the direct international shipment and marketing of narcotics, concentrating instead on the financing aspect of the trade. The main residence on the island is a luxurious mansion, with a handful of decrepit bungalows serving as living&nbsp; quarters for about two dozen employees, mostly security force members, and domestic servants.
The island is served by a dock but also by an airstrip, capable of handling small jet planes, as most departures and arrivals are by plane, the number of boat landings are minimal. It is the ideal location for a clandestine operation.
Narcotics in trans shipment, other than small quantities for personal use, are not kept on the island. The most important function of the island is to serve as a short term haven for high ranking cartel members. A secondary function is the temporary confinement and training of females, destined for the South American slave trade.
The number of such slaves are few, less than five a year. Typically they are attractive young American females, abducted in either Mexico or the United States, who need to adjust to the realities of slave life, before being shipped to their new owners.
Master Cordoba is an old hand at manipulating various intelligence and law enforcement agencies. This is done primarily by providing information on Colombian terrorist groups, occasionally on cartel competitors, or those members who have fallen out of favor. No attempt has ever been made to raid the island, although realistically Master is aware that the island is subject to various forms of electronic surveillance. To thwart such surveillance, communications discipline is strict, and the most sophisticated encryption technology is utilized.
Master was eagerly anticipating the arrival of the latest capture, while not having seen her picture, he was aware she was a twenty five year old American newspaper reporter, whom had been abducted while vacationing near Tijuana. The abduction had taken place within the past eight hours, and the human cargo was immediately shipped out of Mexico by Learjet.
At 9:00AM the sleek passenger jet touched down on the Lugash landing strip, situated about one quarter mile from the mansion. Master was parked on the tarmac in his Land Rover, accompanied by his thirty year old Mexican mistress, Angela, who would play a significant role in the training of the slave.
As the Learjet pulled to a halt, a truck with a portable stair ramp positioned itself near the cabin door, but first a steel plank was extended from the door to the ground. Moments later three of Master&#8217;s goons removed a steel cage from the cabin, and it was slid down the plank. Immediately thereafter the stair ramp was put in place, and the three goons along with the pilot, descended to the tarmac.
Inside the cage, which was about six foot long, four foot tall and wide, was the fully clothed captive. She was a gorgeous blue eyed, short hair blond, about five foot nine and one hundred twenty five pounds. Not unexpectedly she was groggy from the sedatives, injected immediately after her abduction.
While Master had brokered the deal with the prospective slave owner, the abduction had been planned and staged by the three goons, the slave selection being basically a target of opportunity. She was only scheduled to be in Tijuana for three days, but the goons felt she was an ideal candidate to be the personal slave of a Colombian drug lord. After four of five days of training in Lugash, another Learjet would transport her to a clandestine landing strip in Colombia.
Master had established strict rules for the abduction and transport of slaves. The snatch team had to be entrusted with a certain amount of discretion, particularly candidate selection, but one absolute rule was that the slave was not to be used sexually or physically tortured, before arrival on the island. At the time of abduction she was to be sedated, upon being placed on the plane she was to remain locked in the cage for the duration of transport.
 Conversation was to be held to a minimum, even though the captive did not speak fluent Spanish, and she was not to be informed of the purpose of the abduction, until arrival on the island. The snatch team goons were required to wear masks during transport; this was both to prevent their identification, as well as to instill fear in the captive.
These rules were strictly enforced. Some time ago one of the snatch team members had taken sexual liberties with the slave. Word of this quickly reached Master, and arrangements were made to have the offender tortured upon his return to Mexico. A video with audio, was made of the session and played for other team members, predictably the effect was chilling.&nbsp; The goon was never seen again.
Master inspected the passport and other papers of the victim, noting that her name was Nancy Drake, before inquiring �What was her attitude in transport�. �She has been quite mouthy for the past hour with the drug wearing off�, replied one of the goons. Master, leaving her in the cage, officially welcomed her to the island, at which point she verbally protested her predicament, asserting �You have no right to kidnap me, I am an American citizen and demand that I be allowed to speak to the American embassy�. 
This evoked laughter from everyone present. �All right she will have to be taught to be more respectful�, replied Master. Still protesting the goons carried the cage to the Land Rover, where it was placed in the rear. She continued to protest for the duration of the short drive to the mansion.
At this point Master removed her from the cage and used a pair of steel handcuffs to cuff her wrists to the rear. This was followed by attaching a cervical leather collar tightly around her neck, the cuffs on the wrist were then connected to the rear ring of the collar, effectively preventing any resistance. In addition to assuring maximal discomfort, it would promote good posture, a trait highly valued by slave purchasers. To complement this, Master held her in place, while Angela fitted her with a muzzle style ball gag.
The next insult was using a pair of scissors to shred her short sun dress, bra and panties, for the time being she was allowed to retain her black fishnet stockings. Without further ado Angela used a leash to lead the slave to the basement. She was promptly tethered to the ceiling with a short chain, forcing her wrists to be held at the small of the back.
Master and Angela did not partake of bondage sex in the course of their normal relationship. Angela however had both bi-sexual and bondage preferences, in which Master permitted her to indulge on certain occasions. Periodically one of the female domestic servants required discipline, and on these occasions a dungeon session with Angela, invariably produced the desired results.
In the case of the present slave, the purchaser had specified that she be able to perform quality sex, both straight and lesbian. Angela, much to her delight, would thus be allowed to participate in her training on Lugash.
Master had his own theories on slave training. While not a visceral sadist, he had no qualms about using flagellation, particularly to induce quality oral sex. Overall his favorite technique was predicament bondage that is forcing the slave to stand, or otherwise be restrained in uncomfortable positions for extended periods. Nancy would remain tethered and gagged for at least an hour, during that period no one would speak to her, and she had yet to be informed of the purpose of the abduction
Nancy struggled to maintain her emotional equilibrium. Her stay in Mexico had nothing to do with drug cartels, she had met a group of five former female college friends, for a weekend reunion. She could think of no reason for her abduction. Assuming that it was for ransom, she had no hope of anyone paying it. Her parents were not wealthy, and the small town newspaper she worked for would not likely be of assistance.
Master observed Nancy over the CCTV for nearly an hour before beginning the next phase of the training, which consisted of Master and Angela entering the room, and removing the ball gag portion of the muzzle. He was carrying a flogger, which most likely induced Nancy to remain silent.
Her fate was described in no uncertain terms. She had been purchased for use as a sex slave by a Colombian drug dealer. After training on the island, whose location was never divulged, she would be shipped to Colombia. Should she fail to meet the sexual expectations of her owner, she could expect to be used as a manual laborer for the drug operation, or sold to an African owner, where a voracious demand for white female slaves existed.
As part of her training Nancy would no longer be addressed by that name, she would simply be addressed as �Slave�. It would be up to her new owner to select a name for her. Other training rules were made known at this time, Master would always be addressed by that title, and Angela as �Mistress�. She would not speak without permission and would receive a painful flogging each time she did. Still standing tethered, Angela was ordered to use a flogger to deliver two demonstration lashes, one across the boobs, the other to the genital region.
At this point all restraints, except for the padlocked collar, were removed and Nancy was placed in a dank windowless holding cell, illuminated by a single overhead bulb, which would remain on continuously. A seven foot length of chain, anchored to a ring on the floor, was padlocked to her collar. This would barely allow her to stand and reach a bucket which was provided as a toilet. The floor was concrete and no pillow or blanket was provided. Periodically she would be required to stand tethered to the overhead for an extended period, but for the time being would remain in the cell.
A bit of hair styling was in order. Since her new owner wasn&#8217;t interested in a short hair blond, after about two hours of being chained in the cell, she was taken out and strapped to a high backed wooden chair. Angela enthusiastically shaved her head bald. Master always kept a supply of wigs on hand, and decided a very whorish shoulder length blond piece was appropriate for her. This was glued into place and using a mirror Angela showed Nancy her new hair style, emphasizing that it would be permanent. She was then returned to the cell and chained. 
The interior of the holding cell could be monitored visually with a CCTV, equipped with two way audio capability. Part of Master&#8217;s training regimen was to periodically issue remote audio commands, such as to assume a kneeling position, bark like a dog, or other degrading acts.
Two hours later Master received the news. The Colombian drug lord who had purchased Nancy was forced to flee from his stronghold by government forces. This necessitated cancellation of the purchase, for which Master had yet to be paid. His mood instantly took a turn for the worse.
Angela was delighted by this development, but she prudently refrained from expressing her sentiments. Her hope was that Master would keep Nancy in captivity indefinitely, thus providing a personal slave for her use. However Master had other ideas, which reflected his ambivalent attitude towards sexual relationships.
From Master&#8217;s standpoint Angela was for his exclusive sexual use. When other drug kingpins stayed on the island they were permitted to bring their girl friends with them, upon the understanding that Master was free to use any of them to satisfy his sexual desires. The visitors were not allowed to sexually use Angela in any way. As Angela craved sexual diversity, this was much to her chagrin, but Master was unrelenting on this issue. The only sexual diversity permitted Angela was on the rare occasion that one of the female servants was in need of discipline, but even then her activities were strictly controlled by Master.
Some time ago Angela had made a pass at one of the visiting cartel kingpins. Unfortunately this did not go unobserved, as punishment Angela was stripped naked and bound tightly to a chair, then forced to watch as Master engaged in nearly an hour long orgy, with two of the visiting females in threesome style.
While the bond of sexual chemistry between Angela and Master was strong, the grim reality was that Angela would never be allowed to leave Lugash to live in freedom, as she simply had too much knowledge of illicit cartel activities. If she were to rebel against Master&#8217;s dictates, at the least she would be forced to work as a domestic servant on the island, or sold to some owner in Africa. Angela had an aversion to people of color, and Master exploited it quite adeptly.
Master decided that Nancy would be sold on the African market, where the logistics of the sale would be easier and safer, than on the Central or South American market, in addition to commanding a higher sale price.&nbsp;&nbsp; This greatly perturbed Angela for two reasons, first she wished for Nancy to remain on Lugash as her personal slave, second her racial bias overcame her acceptance of slavery in general.
In a rare moment of defiance she forcefully expressed her feelings to Master. His response was swift and stunning, Angela was ordered to be immediately confined and would be sold along with Nancy. �If you find the bitch so attractive you will enjoy her company in the cargo hold of an ocean going freighter and perhaps her buyer will permit you to be lovers�, 
Angela did not submit peacefully and two security force members dragged her to an outdoor conex style metal container, about fifteen feet in length and width, and seven feet in height. She was literally thrown inside and the door was promptly locked. Master smiled with perverse delight as Angela screamed and pounded on the door, demanding to be set free, but this was not to be as she would be locked inside for the near future. Bottled water, along with a toilet bucket, would be provided enabling her to cope with interior temperatures of near one hundred degrees.
The next day a member of the cartel, accompanied by his stunningly attractive twenty five year old Mistress, arrived by plane at the Lugash landing strip. Carlos Vasquez was a portly and balding thirty five year old enforcer for the cartel, who was permitted a three day R&amp;R in Lugash, on route to an assignment in Colombia. His younger Mistress, Juanita, was of Mexican descent and at one time a model for the Latino equivalent of Playboy.
Master Cordoba greeted the pair on the tarmac and promptly decreed that Carlos&#8217; stay in Lugash was cancelled, he would proceed immediately to Colombia, while his Mistress remained on Lugash to serve as his personal plaything.
Carlos immediately protested and promptly received a severe beating by three of Masters&#8217; goons. He was then forcibly placed on the plane, with the pilot ordered at gunpoint to depart immediately. Juanita was then escorted by Master to the mansion and given a tour, of what would be her home for the near future.
Word of Master Cordoba&#8217;s erratic behavior soon reached the cartel triumvirate in Mexico, where it caused immediate alarm. Lugash was essential to the functioning of the cartel, and indications of violence or slavery there could prompt the Netherlands government to seize the island. 
The triumvirate had always taken a dim view of Master&#8217;s slave trafficking, but the fact that he was attempting to sell two females, one American and one Mexican, to an African buyer was especially repugnant. To make matters worse Juanita, who was being held involuntarily on Lugash, was the niece of one of the triumvirate.
Unknown to anyone other than Master Cordoba, was that his bizarre and violent behavior was symptomatic of terminal syphilis, which he had contracted nearly five years ago. Whatever the explanation, he had to be deposed of power on Lugash, before the cartel suffered irreparable damage. Unfortunately this was easier said than done, Master was a fugitive from the Mexican government, and he was not about to return to that country voluntarily.
The idea that Master intended for her to serve as his Mistress indefinitely was repugnant to Juanita, as was the expectation that she was to cater to his every sexual whim. Prudently she refrained from expressing her sentiments, fearing that she would suffer the same fate as Nancy and Angela.
Juanita was treated to a tour of the island, where both female captives were put on display, forced to kneel in obeisance before their captor. Nancy was adjusting to her training and performed without protest. Angela for the near future would be chained outside the conex during the day and then locked inside at night. She would be flogged as necessary to induce the required obedience.
Juanita found Master to be possessed of less than stellar erectile capabilities, with a preference for oral sex. However he was not content for the sex to be limited to two actors, his preference was for a threesome, with Nancy being the third actor.
Master had Nancy brought from her cell to his bedroom, where she was hogtied on the bed. Juanita was ordered to sit against the head board, her legs spread wide, while Nancy&#8217;s face was compressed into Juanita&#8217;s crotch. Under threat of a whipping, Nancy was ordered to use her mouth to pleasure Juanita&#8217;s pussy. Master simultaneously used a dildo to painfully ass fuck Juanita, who pretended arousal, but found the activity appalling. Never before had Juanita engaged in lesbian sex, but was resigned to the fact that it would become routine.
To add insult to injury Master used his erect cock to cunt fuck the hogtied Nancy, her moans of erotic passion only disheartening Juanita even more. This accomplished, she was untied and a security force member was ordered to return her to the cell. With Master unable to attain another erection, Juanita was left sexually unsatisfied for the evening.
As the two lie on the bed embracing each other, Master further enjoyed himself by turning on the CCTV, which focused on Nancy chained in her cell. He used the intercom feature to force Nancy to beg for further sex. Juanita did her best to tune out the disgusting scene, until Master finally decided to call it a night and catch some sleep.
Master&#8217;s sadism continued unabated the following day. Once a bullfighter in Mexico, he had retained a bull whip for sentimental value, never having used it on a human. That morning, in the presence of Juanita, he mercilessly delivered six lashes to Angela, as she was chained outside the Conex. He took delights in her screams of agony, indifferent to the reality that the welts inflicted would be permanent.
The servant staff, both male and female, was placed at Juanita&#8217;s disposal, with orders that they cater to her every whim. One of the servants was a ruggedly handsome male in his twenties, whom Juanita yearned to use sexually, but knew this would certainly incur Master&#8217;s wrath, such would not be the case if she elected to so use one of the female servants.
Juanita was desperate for sex and knew that Master could not satisfy her desires. When at ten in the morning, Master departed for a round of golf on the island&#8217;s nine hole course, Juanita made her move. She summoned the servant Francisco, to the bedroom, where to his astonishment he found her nude except for stockings. He was ordered to undress immediately and that she expected quality sex from him, further adding that �you better be able to get it on or I&#8217;ll tell Master Cordoba you tried to rape me�.
Francisco was in a quandary, he knew that if Master found that he had engaged in sex with Juanita, whether voluntarily or not, that he was certain to be tortured. He quickly decided to acquiesce to her demands and what followed was a ten minute passionate bout of coital sex, which Juanita found immensely gratifying. 
Juanita despised the thought of having to cater to the whims of the sixty year old Master, particularly his preference for three somes and lesbian sex. He simply didn&#8217;t have the erectile capabilities she desired, and could understand Angela&#8217;s frustration. She made known her intent to use Francisco for future sex, despite his imploring her of his violent fate, should Master become aware of the relationship.
In Mexico the triumvirate had concluded it would be necessary to retake Lugash by force. Master could not be executed, as he carried much valuable information in his head rather than putting it in writing, to extract this information he would be tortured if necessary.
A decision was made as to the fate of the three females, being held against their wills, on Lugash. Angela and Juanita would be permitted to return to Mexico, with their relationships restricted to cartel members. Since Angela was privy to much information that would be of value to rival cartels, her relationships would be especially controlled. Nancy would be sold on the Mexican slave market, as she was not related to anyone prominent it was unlikely that any diligent search would be made to find her.
Lugash would remain in the hands of the cartel but would be controlled by someone named by the triumvirate. A major risk was that the current island security force would refuse to accept the authority of the newly designated administrator, which would necessitate the use of force. The strategic value of Lugash was so great, that it could not be permitted to be acquired by a rival cartel.
After a frustrating morning on the golf course, Master stopped to inspect Angela. A twenty foot chain was attached to her metal collar, during the evening hours she was locked inside the conex, while during the daytime hours she was permitted to sit outside. Angela, under threat of a whipping, was required to stand at attention each time. Master approached. She used the latest inspection as an opportunity to plead for mercy, to which Master was dismissive and laughed at her before walking away.
Master was attempting to make arrangements for Angela and Nancy to be sold to an African buyer, but was plagued by delays and haggling over the purchase price. The tentative scheme was to use a speedboat to transport them to a rendezvous with a Nigerian bound freighter, somewhere in the Caribbean, where they would be secured until their arrival on the West African coast.
Nancy&#8217;s regimen for this morning would be another threesome involving Master and Juanita, much to the dismay of the later. Juanita would find her role this morning again being the recipient of oral sex by Nancy, Master would cunt fuck her from the rear. After that it would be some basic humiliation exercises, such as fetching the ball, barking like a dog, mooing like a cow, and the like.
In Mexico the �A Team� was being assembled. The six goons were in effect, the internal affairs unit of the cartel, used exclusively for resolving internal disputes. Jose Delgado, named to be the new Lugash administrator, would arrive there by Learjet on the pretense of a three day vacation, and in accordance with protocol be greeted by Master Cordoba on the tarmac. The A Team goons would then overpower and disarm the security force.
Master would then be interrogated to extract the necessary information, after which he would be returned by plane to Mexico, where he faced an uncertain future. Nancy, Angela and Juanita would accompany him on the flight, with Nancy and Master in restraints. Hopefully the security force members and other cartel employees on Lugash would see fit to cooperate with the new administrator.
Master entered Nancy&#8217;s cell and she immediately stood at attention, this being a requisite element of her training. Without saying a word he attached a leash to her collar and she was led to Master&#8217;s bedroom. Juanita was summoned and ordered to undress. She was still feeling the pleasure from her sexual tryst with servant Fernando, and it was about to be blunted by forced lesbian sex.
Nancy was once again hogtied on the bed, this being a habitual indulgence of Master Cordoba. Juanita was ordered to sit against the head board and Nancy was ordered to begin burrowing away with her tongue into her cunt. Master mounted Nancy from the rear and took to cunt fucking her, this time he ejaculated within three minutes, leaving her to continue performing oral sex upon Juanita.
Juanita tried to pretend she was being aroused sexually but dreaded every second of it, only the thought of additional coital sex with Francisco the servant, enabled her to retain her equanimity. Finally she told Master that she had enough, not knowing what to expect. Master immediately berated Juanita, using uncomplimentary terms to disparage her sexual attractiveness.
As punishment Master produced a pair of steel handcuffs, using them to cuff Juanita&#8217;s wrists behind her to the headboard. The leash used to lead Nancy was again attached to the front loop on her collar, then pulled underneath Juanita&#8217;s crotch and attached to the headboard. Nancy&#8217;s mouth was now sealed tightly against Juanita&#8217;s cunt, and neither could do anything to extricate them from the arrangement.
Nancy was ordered to use her mouth continuously until directed to stop, which would be at least two hours. To assure compliance Master emphasized the room was under CCTV surveillance, and if Nancy should stop Master would quickly be aware of it, which would result in a severe whipping. To round off the arrangement Juanita was ball gagged, with Master remarking that he didn&#8217;t intend for the two to enjoy a chat.
Master then departed, leaving Juanita to agonize as Nancy unrelentingly performed the oral sex. For Juanita it was a double whammy, she had not previously been aware that the bedroom was covered by the CCTV, and could easily have been observed having sex with Francisco. Her fear now was that Master would put her on the slave market along with Nancy and Angela, this despot seemed to be capable of almost any form of cruelty.
The Learjet left the remote Mexican airfield with Jose Delgado, the six A team goons, and the pilot aboard. As directed by an encrypted electronic message, Master was on the tarmac when the plane touched down two hours later in Lugash. To his shock the A team goons exited at the same time as Jose, each carrying some type of assault rifle, and Master was surrounded, his security force had not been put on alert.
�What is the meaning of this�, demanded Master. Jose&#8217;s response was to produce a leather blackjack and whack the back of his head, causing him to fall to the ground in a semiconscious state. Jose then used Master&#8217;s push-to-talk to summon Jorge, the head of the security force, whom upon arriving was in a state of consternation as to what was transpiring.
Jose promptly read the riot act to Jorge, who prudently ordered the remainder of the security force to honor the change of command. One of the goons used a plastic handcuff to bind Master Cordoba&#8217;s wrists behind him, he was then pulled to his feet, placed in the Land Rover, and marched at gunpoint into the mansion.
Jose immediately inquired as to the whereabouts of Nancy, Angela and Juanita. He was taken to the conex where Angela was sitting forlornly on the ground, nude with the chain attached to her collar. Fernando volunteered that the other two women were likely confined to Master&#8217;s bedroom. Jose immediately ordered the collar and chain removed, and for Angela to go inside the mansion and dress.
Jose was astonished to find the two women naked and shackled together in the bedroom, �What the fuck is this all about�, he exclaimed. Fernando identified Nancy as the slave, while Jose removed Juanita&#8217;s ball gag. Leaving Nancy hogtied for the moment, Fernando was ordered to find a key for the handcuffs, which were then removed from Juanita.
Juanita explained the situation the best she could, with Jose assuring her that Master Cordoba was no longer in power, and she would soon be reunited in Mexico with her boy friend. Nancy would also be returned to Mexico, and in all probability be sold as a slave to a Central American buyer.
Next Jose turned his attention to Master Cordoba, who was ordered taken to the basement, just outside Nancy&#8217;s holding cell, where he was bound to a chair. The interrogation would be a lengthy one, as Master was likely to claim that he did not have all the desired information.
Jose used a secure phone to send a coded message to the triumvirate, that the takeover had been accomplished without violence. At this time his orders were changed. Master Cordoba, Angela and Jose would remain in Lugash indefinitely, while Nancy and Juanita were to be flown back to Mexico. Authorization was given to torture Angela if necessary to extract any information that could not be obtained from Master. Jose found this quite surprising, considering Angela&#8217;s family connection to the triumvirate
Much to her dismay Angela, now fully dressed, was led to the basement and locked in the holding cell. She caught a glimpse of Master bound to the chair, but locked in the cell could neither hear nor see what was happening.
The flight carrying Nancy and Juanita to Mexico was to depart immediately, with only one of the goons accompanying, the others were needed to establish control of Lugash. Nancy was dressed in an orange jump suit, shackled at the legs and wrists, with steel cuffs of the type used to transport ordinary prisoners. As the rules required prisoners to be blindfolded, or for the goons to wear masks, Nancy was made to wear a leather hood with only an opening for the nose. She was given an Ativan orally for mild sedation.
For Nancy it was a relief to learn that she wouldn&#8217;t be sold to an African buyer, hopefully if she were to be held in Mexican slavery, that one day escape might be possible. She abhorred having to wear a hood but having been conditioned by Master not to speak without permission, she wasn&#8217;t about to protest. Fifteen minutes later the Learjet was air born for the two hour flight to Mexico. Juanita and the goon were chatting, while Nancy tried to maintain her composure.
The first stop on the flight was a remote airstrip in Central Mexico. A decision had been made to confine Nancy at a secure brothel in a small city, less than ten miles away. The brothel was managed by Mistress Carmela, a plump fifty year old, whose outward pleasant appearance masked the personality of a visceral sadist. She managed a staff of fifteen prostitutes, along with a male security force, with the clientele limited to upper ranking cartel members.
The brothel was also used for disciplining wayward females, who were wives or friends of cartel members. Mistress Carmela personally supervised such discipline, which consisted of corporal punishment, forced lesbian sex and miscellaneous tortures. The same techniques were occasionally employed on errant staff, however for the regular clientele bondage was not available, with activities limited to conventional sex. Mistress only regret was that her staff was so well behaved, that seldom was there any justification to discipline any of them. She looked forward to having Nancy as a temporary and unwilling guest.
In Lugash the interrogation of Master Cordoba was proceeding smoothly. The application of a heated curling iron to his left nipple quickly induced him to reveal the password for his computer, this would enable the A Team IT specialist to analyze the voluminous files, but would require days to complete.
Jose had participated in other interrogations involving the use of torture, and could not think of anyone whom had been broken as quickly as Master. However it was just as well, as the preferred method of torture was electroshock, and since Master reportedly had a heart condition, this modality would have been exceptionally risky.
The next technique to be used was experimental, consisting of intravenous injection of a drug believed to induce subjects to provide truthful answers. It was known to Jose only by the code name of �Candor�. One of the A Team members, with paramedic experience, injected Master with the drug and Jose waited ten minutes following the injection, to begin the interrogation.
Jose was able to elicit several incriminating admissions from Master. Most of these involved financial irregularities, in that Master was diverting cartel profits into his own accounts. Another was that he had provided information to the police which resulted in the arrest of a high ranking cartel member. While cartel members routinely provided such information about their rivals, doing so against fellow cartel members was cause for execution.
It would take several days to verify the information, in the meantime Master was confined to the holding cell, previously occupied by Nancy. Angela was removed from the cell and a high level decision was made concerning her fate. She would be returned to Mexico and held indefinitely in solitary confinement, at a maximum security prison under control of the cartel. 
Pending transport to Mexico, Angela would be placed under room lock, one of the more comfortable forms of detention on Lugash. She was confined to the bedroom, and the chain used to shackle her to the shipping container was used to secure her, by encircling it around her waist and attaching the other end to the bed frame, permitting her just enough length to stand beside the bed.
Angela was quite vocal in protesting her confinement, and asserting that she was not guilty of anything. This failed to sway Jose, who accused her of complicity in the diversion of cartel profits, at any rate she could argue her case before the triumvirate upon return to Mexico. Pending transport she would be allowed reading material, but denied access to any electronic communication. Meals would be brought to her in the room and periodically she would be allowed to use the bathroom.
Mistress Carmela, along with two of her male security force members, were waiting on the tarmac as the Learjet touched down. Nancy was quickly transferred, still shackled, to the rear of a windowless van. Her hood was removed and replaced with a blindfold.
The drive to the brothel took about fifteen minutes, which seemed like eternity to Nancy. She desperately wanted the blindfold removed but knew better than to do so. It was not removed until she was in the basement of the brothel, she had no idea where it was at, but assumed it was in Mexico.
Mistress Carmela quickly spelled out the rules. Nancy could only speak with permission, to address Mistress by that title, and to refer to herself as �slave�. Her name was no longer Nancy, this would be decided by her new owner. Depending upon her attitude she would either be sold on the Central American market, or if not a sale to an African owner could be arranged.
Nancy would spend much of her time locked in a large steel dog cage, similar to the one used on her initial flight to Lugash. She was stripped naked and fitted with a studded leather collar, this was padlocked in place and would be worn for the duration of her stay. Four leather cuffs were also padlocked, one for each wrist and ankle.
Her training would consist of basic obedience training which would be for three or four days.&nbsp; She could also expect to sexually satisfy a number of males, who would be cartel members visiting the brothel, and carefully selected by Carmela. They would be allowed to have their way with her and could include corporal punishments.
The next phase would be the auction, which would be accomplished by video teleconferencing. For this she would be provided with appropriate attire and cosmetics. It was emphasized that it was to her advantage to favorably impress the prospective buyers, as the slaves commanding the highest purchase price, would most likely be for the exclusive use of the buyer. The alternative was being used as a commercial whore, where conditions would be far more unattractive.
Nancy was then locked in the cage, her wrists and ankles cuffed to the bars, in a most uncomfortable spread eagled arrangement. This was purely for discomfort, as there was no possibility of escape from the cage, even unrestrained. She was then left unattended to ponder her fate. 
A decision was made to confine Master Cordoba indefinitely on Lugash, while Angela would be placed in a Mexican prison. She once again begged for mercy, but was told she would have a �trial� before a cartel tribunal. No such trial would be held, with the complicity of the corrupt prison warden, she would be listed as having been sentenced by a court for some fabricated crime.
Transport for Angela would be by boat, with a forty five power yacht docking at Lugash, carrying two operatives. At 6:00AM Angela was placed in handcuffs and ordered to accompany the two operatives to the dock. Alberto, the older and the heavier set of the two, was in charge. Angela was put in the cabin and ordered to immediately strip to her stockings.
Alberto had plans to use the captive sexually during the voyage, leaving his assistant to pilot the boat. She was ordered to lie on her back on the king sized bed, with two sets of handcuffs used to secure her in spread eagle fashion, to the headboard. A fifteen inch spreader bar, attached to a leather cuff on each ankle, would both make her accessible for sex, in addition to serving as a hobble should it be necessary for her to use the head.
For Angela the grim reality was this would most certainly be her last sexual encounter with a male. Everyone knew that the male guards, at the all female prison, were inclined to hit upon younger females, with the same holding true for lesbian guards.
Alberto first indulged in some fetishes of his own. Chortling that �blonds have more fun�, he fitted her with a blond wig, and upon seeing it in the mirror Angela thought it was atrocious. Next Angela was fitted with the face muzzle and ball gag that she had recently used on Nancy. �You bastard screamed� Angela as the ball was forced into her mouth. 
Alberto let it be known that he would not permit any speech from her during the trip and that the only use for her mouth would be oral sex. Since the straps on the contraption locked into place she would be unable to remove any portion of it, even if her wrists were not secured. As punishment for using an epithet, Alberto attached a clamp to each of her nipples before using a connecting chain, then yanking it back and forth several times. Angela&#8217;s muted screams were music to his ears.
After leaving her unattended to wallow in misery for nearly fifteen minutes, Alberto commenced with the rape. For Angela, despite the anguish of impending incarceration, the nearly fifteen minutes of being fucked by a super sized rock hard cock was ecstasy. His cock was the largest to have ever penetrated her, much greater than any gratification she had obtained from Master Cordoba. But all good things must end, and after multiple orgasms Alberto withdrew. Playing upon her anxiety, he suggested that more sex would be forthcoming before the trip ended, but that it would include some pain.
Nancy&#8217;s treatment by Mistress Carmela was far more brutal than she had expected. One piece of equipment in the dungeon was a wooden saw horse device, over which Nancy was bent, with her wrist and ankle cuffs secured to the corners of the post, enabling Carmela to inflict her favorite form of torture, this being the use of a strap on to fuck her anally. Nancy had no prior experience with anal sex, but it was obvious that Carmela was thrusting in a manner which would assure maximal pain.
From ass fucking, Carmela progressed to flagellation. Using a cat of nine style flogger, Nancy received nearly seventy lashes to her buttocks, at progressively increasing intensities. She was silenced by a set of panties stuffed into her mouth. Nancy was on the verge of passing out from the pain, as Carmela ceased the flogging. The panties were removed from her mouth and she spent the rest of the night locked in the cage, trying to maintain her sanity and hoping tomorrow&#8217;s regimen would be less brutal.
The next day the emphasis was on obedience and humiliation training. Led on a chain, she was forced to crawl on the dungeon floor making barking sounds, as well as forced stressful kneeling positions for extended periods.
Late in the afternoon she had her first sexual contact with a male, he was one of the cartel goons who had participated in the initial abduction. He was once again masked but she immediately recognized him from his voice and physical build. Carmela&#8217;s preference was to emphasize oral sex training, and for this purpose Nancy was bound kneeling on the floor, while the goon sat on a chair in front of her.
The goon quickly complained about Nancy&#8217;s less than vigorous performance. As punishment her mouth was forced open with a metal ratchet type gag, and the goon involuntarily mouth fucked her, forcing her to swallow his load. Nancy then received a severe breast whipping from Carmela, after which she was ordered to serve the goon again orally, this time without the ratchet gag and the threat of another whipping if her teeth made contact with his cock.
Spread eagled to the bed on the boat, Angela was ignored by Alberto who seemed more interested in watching a bondage porn video, and occasionally alternating turns as pilot. The other goon was a bearded pot belly type, who completely ignored Angela while he took his break in the cabin.
Alberto decided a bit of erotic torment was in store for Angela. He began removing his trousers, as if intending to fuck her once again, but then pulled them back up, laughing at the false hope he had aroused. Angela&#8217;s muzzle gag prevented him from fully appreciating her venomous stare.
 �You deserve some pleasure�, chuckled Alberto. That pleasure was inserting a four inch butt plug, along with an eight cunt dildo, and then using a coil of rope to tie her crotch painfully tight, assuring that the intruders would remain in place. He then returned to watching videos, and taking periodic swigs from a bottle of rum.
Angela had been dildoed many times over the years, but never in a manner intended to be painful. Pain was clearly the intent in this case, as both devices had knobbed services, were of a wide diameter, which were especially painful when being inserted. The crotch rope was equally painful.
Carmela was becoming increasing frustrated at Nancy&#8217;s seeming inability to perform quality oral sex. As punishment she was attached to an overhead device, such that she would have to stand in a most uncomfortable position for several hours. In addition she received another painful flogging, consisting of nearly fifty flogger strokes distributed between her back, buttocks and breasts.
After a refueling stop on the Honduran coast, the boat carrying Angela continued to a small port off the Yucatan Peninsula, about twenty miles from the prison. It was sunrise and an official prison transport van, staffed by two dykish type guards, was waiting.
Angela&#8217;s transfer was swift, after removing her restraints and muzzle gag, she was made to dress in a standard red jump suit. The cunt and ass dildos were left tied in place, much to the amusement of Alberto. Angela could not resist the temptation to call him a �fucking bastard�, again evoking his amusement. 
The two female guards were not amused and one slapped her hard across the face, before she was put in handcuffs once again, and dragged to the waiting van. She was forced into the rear of the van and her handcuffs attached a ring, preventing her from moving about. The door was slammed shut and the guards began the drive back to the prison. Angela could scream to her heart&#8217;s content, with the guards insulated from her protests by a Plexiglas shield, partitioning the driver&#8217;s compartment from the rear.
Juanita looked forward to her arrival at the remote Mexican airstrip, and to quickly reuniting with her lover, Carlos. That was not to be the case as upon landing, two cartel enforcers were waiting with the order that �You will accompany us to Master Gomez for investigation�. Her wrists were cuffed behind her with steel cuffs.
�What is the meaning of this�, Juanita irately demanded, and was told only that Carlos was suspected of diverting cartel funds, and that she too was suspect. �This is ridiculous�, she responded and was confident the matter would be resolved quickly. She was put in the rear seat of an SUV with one goon sitting beside her, as the other drove.
Juanita&#8217;s continued inquiries were ignored with the suggestion she remain silent pending her appearance before Master Gomez, one of the high ranking cartel members, just below the triumvirate. Juanita resigned herself to the indignity, as the goon sitting beside her appeared to be staring at her boobs, which were well exposed by the strapless dress she was wearing. 
Master Gomez resided in a luxurious mansion on the outskirts of town, which was surrounded by a wall. An armed guard opened the gate and the SUV pulled to a halt beside the mansion. Juanita was led by the goons to a large office where Gomez awaited her. She had never seen him before but was immediately impressed by his lean and muscular appearance, a hulk she thought, probably not much older than thirty and seemingly mild mannered.
 �What is the meaning of this, having me brought here in handcuffs and where is Carlos�, she demanded, pointing her finger at him for emphasis. Juanita quickly realized that he was not the amicable, mild mannered person she assumed. �Stand at attention when you speak to me and address me as Sir or I&#8217;ll have you tied and horse whipped, do you understand�, he thundered.
Juanita did not reply and Gomez repeated �Do you understand�. �Yes�, she replied somewhat sarcastically. �Yes what� he demanded in an even more strident tone. �Yes sir� she replied, this time in a more respectful tone. He quickly got down to business. Carlos was suspected of being an informant for a rival cartel and was undergoing interrogation at an undisclosed location.
She was guilty, if for no reason other than association, and would be detained for questioning. Depending upon the results she would either be �disposed of�, or �otherwise dealt with humanely�. Gomez quickly defined the later contingency by stating that he was in need of a Mistress, and that Juanita had favorable attributes.
�I will cooperate Sir�, Juanita replied, again in a respectful tone. The prospect of serving as his Mistress was certainly more attractive than being consigned to some penal colony, or disposed of violently. �Very good I will have you prepared for interrogation�, he replied.
At this point the two goons who had transported her from the airfield were summoned, and directed to take her to the basement. In the basement was a high backed wooden chair with straps attached to it. She was ordered to sit and the heavy duty straps were used to secure her wrists, ankles and waist, to the chair. Juanita breathed a sigh of relief, at least she wasn&#8217;t about to be raped by the goons, but this feeling quickly changed as a metallic device with cables was wheeled into place. 
The van carrying Angela was driven through the gate of the concertina wired perimeter of the prison, coming to a stop in the courtyard. There it was greeted by a tall thin woman in her forties. Dressed in a dark blue business suit, she looked more like a piano teacher, than the warden of a remote desert prison.
After Angela was removed from the van, the warden introduced herself as Senorita Julia. Angela was informed that she was now an inmate at Prison Number 14, and that she would be serving an indeterminate sentence for �conduct in furtherance of a criminal enterprise�. After processing she would be placed in solitary confinement for at least five days, after which she would placed in a special unit for high value offenders.
Angela emphatically asserted that she was a legal resident of Lugash, a foreign country, that her extradition was in violation of International Law, and that she was entitled to speak to the Dutch Consulate. �Your request will be taken under consideration� replied Julia, in a tone that Angela found both condescending and insincere.
Julia departed leaving Angela in custody of the two guards, who immediately led her to the processing unit, with the dildos making walking quite painful. The officer in charge there was an older heavy set woman. She ordered the restraints and dildos removed from Angela, and for her to remove her clothes, in preparation for a body cavity search.
Angela, anticipating this indignity, begrudgingly complied, as the two transport guards stood smiling, the other guard donned a latex glove.
The search would be performed with Angela lying on her stomach on an examining table with stirrups for each wrist and ankle, these were secured with leather straps and two pillows were placed underneath her stomach, forcing her ass to be thrust upwards.
What followed was far more painful than anything Angela had anticipated. Instead of the rectal probe the guard inserted two fingers into her cunt and began gently finger fucking her. Abruptly the guard inserted all five fingers and what followed was a brutal fisting, that caused Angela to scream uncontrollably. The two transport guards stood in front of Angela, both smiling as the prisoner was tortured.
Juanita pondered the impending ordeal of electroshock torture, as she was left unattended for nearly ten minutes. She knew very little about Carlos&#8217; cartel related activities; while she was aware that he was an enforcer, he never confided to committing any acts of violence. 
Likewise she was not acquainted with any of his associates, although she saw some of them from time to time. She decided her best bet was to convince Gomez she was being truthful, and to be spared torture.
What Gomez, but not Juanita, was aware of, was that Carlos was killed in a gun battle with police, as he tried to flee to the United States. Since he had not been interrogated prior to his death, it was difficult to verify any information that she might provide.
At the brothel things were not going well for Nancy. Carmela was thoroughly dissatisfied with her sexual performance and no amount of discipline would likely cause her to improve. She was reluctant to put Nancy on the market even as a common whore, the only alternative seemed to be as an indentured servant in the farming sector.
Angela writhed in pain, still strapped to the examining table, for nearly ten minutes while the guards leisurely chatted and enjoyed coffee. She was then released and ordered to dress in official prison clothing, which consisted of the jumpsuit, cheap lingerie, and white athletic shoes. At this time the warden appeared, handcuffed Angela and announced she would personally escort her to the cell. 
As she was escorted Angela implored the warden to permit her to call Master Raoul, one of the three members of the governing triumvirate, as she was confident this would result in favorable intervention on her behalf. �What about the Dutch Consulate� replied the warden, trying not to sound dismissive or sarcastic.
Angela reiterated her plea but was informed that inmates were not permitted to make calls or receive visitors, however she assured Angela that �I&#8217;ll mention your request to him should he call�. The handcuffs were then removed and she was locked in her cell.
The isolation area consisted of four separate cells, each a windowless room, with a metal door that had a one way mirror. Guards could see into the cell, but inmates could not see out. The design made seeing or speaking with other inmates impossible. Each cell was provided with a cot, mattress, pillow and toilet, as well as a partition, by means of which meals could be served, without having to open the cell door.
______
Gomez began his interrogation of Juanita in an unusual manner. �I&#8217;ve tortured men and women in the past but you are simply too beautiful to shock with electricity. I urge, even beg, that you tell me the truth so I will not have to torture you�.
The request sounded sincere to Juanita and she sensed a sexual bond was forming between them. He proceeded to answer questions which he knew that Juanita could answer correctly, he did not catch her in any lie. She described the best she could the names or descriptions of Carlos&#8217; associates.
Gomez was particularly interested in knowing whether Carlos had any contact with a certain rival cartel member. Juanita provided the correct name, little did she realize the importance of the question. After about thirty minutes of questioning, Gomez concluded she had been truthful, and that no further information of value could be extracted.
Juanita did her best to exploit his attraction for her, by using the line �Thank you sir for sparing me torture and I apologize for being rude earlier, I would be honored to serve you in any capacity that you desire and assure you of my continuing loyalty�.
At this point he informed Juanita of the death of Carlos, this failed to cause any visible grief on her part. She was then escorted to the guest bedroom for a consultation with Gomez&#8217; clothing specialist. He assured Juanita she would be provided with expensive clothing, hair styling and cosmetic work. She would be restricted to the compound, this being a routine precaution for all staff. For the time being she would not be allowed any electronic or written conversation.
______
For three days Angela endured the abject misery of solitary confinement, with the exception of being allowed outside in a cage attached to the main building. She was shackled each time for the one hundred foot walk, she saw no other prisoners, and her guards did not speak to her. Meals were provided through a small panel in the cell door.
On the fourth day a heavily armored SUV pulled into the prison parking. Besides the two heavily armed bodyguards, the other occupant was Master Luis Ramirez, one of three members of the cartel triumvirate. The sixty five year old, balding, portly and immaculately dressed, was quickly admitted inside the compound, while his bodyguards remained outside.
After a ten minute conversation with the warden, Angela was brought from her cell to the warden&#8217;s office, occupied only by Ramirez. The two were distant relatives but hadn&#8217;t seen each other for many years.
�This is all a mistake�, were the first words Angela impulsively blurted upon entering. �I will ask the questions�, snapped Ramirez. �Yes sir� Angela demurred.
An untimely time had struck a second member of the cartel. Master Cordoba had suffered a fatal attack while confined on Lugash, but Angela was not aware of this. Ramirez was interested in some specific information pertaining to Cordoba&#8217;s activities, and with Angela incarcerated solely on his authority, he had the ultimate leverage.
Angela was ordered to remain standing for the interrogation, and over the course of the next half hour, Ramirez asked numerous questions. He quickly sensed that Angela was providing false information, rather than claiming not to know the answer. At the end of the interrogation Ramirez knew little more than he began, concluding that Cordoba had confided scant information about financial matters, with Angela.
�You will remain a prisoner until I can verify your information, if it is accurate you will be promptly released� stated Ramirez, in a manner that Angela did not find reassuring. Before she could plead for mercy two guards entered the room and attempted to escort Angela back to her cell.
While being escorted back to her cell, Angela demanded to speak with Ramirez again, and became quite vocal. The warden ordered her taken to room three, which is the designated area for physical punishment. As she struggled a leather cuff was placed on each wrist, and then attached to an overhead device. A few hours of standing in this position would improve her attitude. The warden, to the dismay of some of her more sadistic guards, seldom permitted prisoners to be whipped.
______
Ramirez, unaware of the outburst, then summoned the warden and directed her to procure the most attractive female prisoner available, to be used for his sexual pleasure. Such was his power that the warden uttered not a word in protest, and immediately ordered a guard to bring a certain prisoner to her office. The secretary was ordered to leave her outer office, while the warden took her place, assuring there would be no interruptions.
Five minutes later Cecilia, a twenty five year petite blue eyed blond, was brought to the office. An American citizen, she emigrated to Mexico after marrying a citizen of that country. She had been involved in narcotics trafficking and was serving a five year sentence. Ramirez took it upon himself to promise her time off for good behavior, if she provided quality oral sex, otherwise she would face lengthy solitary confinement.
Cecilia, after being ordered to strip nude, kneeled in front of Ramirez as he sat on the couch, and made a diligent attempt to satisfy his demands for oral sex. Ramirez seemed pleased with her deep throat technique, but after five minutes his mercurial personality erupted.
Whether he resented her American nationality, or simply wasn&#8217;t satisfied with her sexual technique, cannot be explained. He abruptly ordered her to cease, and berated her for not performing to his expectations. He then ordered the warden to summon a guard. Cecilia would be taken nude to the outdoor exercise yard, currently occupied by most of the inmates, and handcuffed to an overhead post.
This accomplished, Ramirez took a flogger and delivered nearly seventy five painful lashes to both sides, and both extremities, of her body. Ramirez proudly announced to the inmates, who had been forced to observe, that this was the penalty to be suffered for defiance of his authority.
The warden, seething with disgust, watched powerless to intervene. She was quite mindful of an incident about two years earlier, when the warden had challenged Ramirez&#8217; authority. Ramirez immediately placed a call to the State Superintendent of Prisons, and within an hour the warden was relieved of her duties, ordered to don prison clothing, and placed in solitary confinement. Such was the power of Ramirez and his cartel, and the current warden was not about to challenge it.
______
At the brothel Carmela entertained a proposition, in which Nancy would be sold on the Mexican slave market, but not require the skills of a top notch prostitute. A middle aged rancher and his wife, both with cartel connections, were interested in acquiring a slave for pony girl training. They already owned one and sought a second, however the price they were willing to pay for an untrained slave was below what Carmela considered market value.
Carmela explained she simply didn&#8217;t have the equipment, such as harnesses and corsets that were basic to this type of training. She was however more than willing to conduct the training if the prospective owners would provide such equipment. Haggling over the price followed and Carmela slammed the phone down, after characterizing the couple as �Mexican Jews�. Carmela was confident a deal would eventually be struck, as American slaves were in high demand.
______
For Juanita events were taking a course for the worst. After being measured by the clothier, Gomez entered the bedroom and it became apparent that his desires included not just sex, but infliction of severe pain as well. The first step was to order Juanita to remove all clothing, lie face down on the bed, after which she was tied spread-eagled to the four corners of the bed. �I like my women tied when I fuck them and do other things to them�, he announced ominously.
The �other thing� he had in mind for the moment was to brand Juanita on the buttock, using a cauterizing pencil. �You will be my property forever, if you fail to perform as a mistress I will have you sent to prison and put on a chain gang, should you ever escape you will be identified and brought back to me.� A former mistress had done so and was tracked down, adding that �She was punished and appropriately disposed of�, without elaborating.
Juanita knew that begging for mercy was pointless. Gomez summoned a male assistant to perform the branding process, which lasted nearly ten minutes. The pain was excruciating and it took every ounce of fortitude to deny him the gratification of her screaming, with the ropes preventing her from thrashing about.
______
Headquartered in a highly secure area of a military base near San Diego, is Task Force Kilo, a top secret interagency group consisting of American intelligence, military and law enforcement personnel. It is dedicated to combating the Mexican cartels, primarily through intelligence gathering, both human source and electronic. While not directly involved in covert activities, it has essentially a blank check to pay informants.
One of the upper echelons of Task Force Kilo is Carla, a career intelligence specialist. Her daughter Sheila was one of the college reunion group that included Nancy, and the last person to see her before the abduction. Sheila had reported her friend&#8217;s disappearance to the Mexican authorities, who displayed little interest in the case.
Sheila had importuned her mother to pursue the matter. Carla was skeptical, knowing that even if Nancy could be located, it was against American government policy to attempt a rescue. The diplomatic and political implications of conceding the existence of American hostages was simply too great.
However the daughter was unrelenting and Carla, against her own good judgment, agreed to investigate. Her superiors were opposed to the idea, but the reality of life in such elite organizations, is that power is determined by the amount of adverse information that one employee can acquire against the other.
Between knowledge of extra marital affairs and various illicit activities, Carla was a force to reckoned with, and thus was able to sway her superiors. The security on Lugash had been so effective that Operation Kilo had not detected any indications of slavery there. However security at the brothel was relatively lax, and through human source intelligence, it was learned that an American female was being held there and offered for sale into slavery.
To Carla this was an especially perilous situation. The brothel was quasi-independent from the Lugash related cartel, and Carmela was likely to sell her slave to a buyer in another Latin American country. If this were to occur the likelihood of Nancy ever being rescued was almost impossible.
The only viable solution was to arrange for another cartel to purchase Nancy from Carmela, and ultimately exfiltrate her to the United States. Operation Kilo had a working relationship with a smaller Mexican cartel, headquartered about one hundred fifty miles from the brothel. Such an undertaking would cost fifty thousand dollars, an amount Kilo superiors considered exorbitant.
Carla was aware of questionable transactions between Kilo and different cartels, costing as much or not more. It was the fear that these transactions would be disclosed to Kilo&#8217;s parent agency, which resulted in the expenditure request being approved.
Nancy came very close to being sold into pony slavery, as only thirty minutes after a sale price was agreed to with the Ramona Cartel, the prospective pony buyer called to offer a bid. Carmela at least had the integrity to honor the Ramona bid, even though the latest bid was higher than the Ramona amount
Carmela was determined to obtain as much sadistic gratification as possible from Nancy for the remaining twenty four hours of her stay at the brothel. After a brutal anal strap on fucking, pain dildos were inserted into each of her holes, and held in place by a metal chastity belt. Carmela looked forward to presenting the contraption, along with the key, to the new buyer as a symbol of appreciation. Pending transfer to her new owner, Nancy was frog tied and forced to sit on the floor. One of Carmela&#8217;s hookers had earlier performed an enema, Nancy would not be allowed any food or liquid.
Juanita was forced to languish in agony, tied tightly to the bed. To exacerbate her anguish Gomez summoned a BBW type maid to the room and ordered her to strip naked. As he sat on the bed next to her, the maid was ordered to perform fellatio upon him. This continued for nearly ten minutes before Gomez climaxed, and the maid ordered to swallow his ejaculate.

Gomez then received a call that left him elated. Brianna, his ex-Mistress, begged to be allowed to return to the mansion, and to resume their relationship. This was agreeable to Gomez, with the understanding she would be allowed to use Juanita as her personnel slave. Gomez gleefully informed Juanita of this, much to her chagrin.
Pending the arrival of Brianna, Juanita was placed in a restricted servant status. This meant she was not allowed to leave the compound and was required to wear a black maid&#8217;s uniform with a fourteen inch ankle hobble, which would permit her to perform housework while minimizing the possibility of escape. When not working she was locked in a private bedroom with television being the only electronic device permitted. In addition she was prohibited from all sexual activity, pending Brianna&#8217;s arrival. 
Juanita was heartbroken by the change in her status, as she had savored the possibility of having regular sex with Gomez. She now realized he was a brutal sadist who would continue to torture her, while denying her the desired type of sex.&nbsp; Serving as Brianna&#8217;s slave would mean being forced to perform lesbian sex as well.
One of Carla&#8217;s requirements of the Ramona cartel was that Nancy not be subjected to any forced sex, nor was she to be informed of the location where she was being held. Diego, the cartel chief, assured Carla this would be the case, although he fully intended to use Nancy for his own sexual gratification.
Three of his goons were assigned the task of transporting Nancy from the brothel to cartel headquarters, using a Land Rover. For the one hundred fifty mile drive Nancy would be locked in a cage and not allowed to speak with anyone, with the goons required to wear masks when in her presence. Carmela dressed her in a red fishnet body stocking suit, with the chastity restraint to remain in place. The goon leader would be entrusted with the key, and would have hell to pay if the device were removed before Nancy&#8217;s arrival at the cartel mansion. Carmela had graciously provided a seal, if the seal were broken, it would be assumed that Nancy had been used sexually.
Brianna arrived at the Gomez compound within two days and took an intuitive dislike to Juanita. Perhaps it was the fact that Juanita had been a photo model featured often in the Mexican entertainment media. Brianna lacked some of Juanita&#8217;s curvaceous features, but compensated for this with an aggressively dominant personality.
Juanita was ordered by Brianna to accompany her to the bedroom and to strip nude. Sitting in a chair, Juanita was ordered to kneel on the floor and to use her tongue on Brianna&#8217;s pussy. �You&#8217;ll be tasting this quite a bit, so you may as well get used to it�, chucked Brianna. With Gomez standing nearby and smiling, Juanita performed the repugnant task for nearly five minutes.
Brianna then used rope to secure Juanita on the bed, in a painfully tight hog tie. �You&#8217;ll be tied up quite a bit so get used to it�, she quipped. Juanita couldn&#8217;t help but think that painful bondage and sex were commonplace at the Gomez mansion.
The transfer of Nancy from the brothel to the Land Rover went smoothly. After the three goons donned ski masks, Nancy was blindfolded and led to the Land Rover. Her blindfold was removed and she was locked in a cage in the rear of the vehicle. With the windows blacked out there was no danger that she would recognize her whereabouts. The goons ignored her for the two hour trip back to the Ramona estate.
Ramirez finally departed from the prison, but not before terrorizing Angela, inflicting severe pain upon the other prisoner, and verbally humiliating the warden for her lenient ways. Angela was ordered to remain in solitary confinement indefinitely. Ramirez threatened to punish the warden severely, should Angela be released from solitary.
Diego was waiting to greet the Land Rover as it entered the compound. He was not masked and the three transport goons were permitted to unmask. Diego removed Nancy from the cage, introduced himself, and led her to his office. For the first time she was informed of the possibility she might be exfiltrated to the United States and granted her freedom. It was contingent upon her good behavior, and specifically her willingness to please Diego sexually.
Nancy was guardedly optimistic over the latest development. Diego, noting that she must be uncomfortable from the chastity belt, had her remove her body stocking, after which he unlocked the contraption and removed the two dildos stuffed into her holes. ��Thank you sir�, she demurred. Diego commented that the wig Nancy was wearing did nothing to enhance her sexual appeal. He offered to replace it, only to be informed that Angela had glued it into place, after shaving her natural hair bald.
Diego then summoned his maid who, was ordered to see to it that Nancy was bathed, then provided with clean underwear and a dress. Nancy was led to a bedroom, and when they returned to Diego&#8217;s office about thirty minutes later, she was wearing a skimpy black dress and barefooted. It was the first time since her abduction that she wasn&#8217;t caged or somehow restrained, and the cruel tortures inflicted since her abduction, made her weary that she might finally treated be treated humanely.
Diego ordered that she be fed and permitted to obtain some rest, after which she would show appreciation to him for his kindness. While not restrained, Nancy was restricted to the mansion, not allowed to communicate externally, nor informed of her whereabouts.
Meanwhile at the Gomez mansion, Juanita was being subjected to unrelenting cruelty and humiliation. Brianna had a fixation for keeping other females in restraint, she was especially fond of keeping Juanita hogtied, while forced to watch extended sexual activity between Gomez and Brianna. When not so engaged Juanita was required to perform menial household labor, while continuously hobbled so as to prevent any mischief on her part. The only sex permitted so far was using her tongue to pleasure Brianna&#8217;s cunt, and she was told not to expect any heterosexual activity.
Rather than keep Angela indefinitely in solitary at Prison 14, Ramirez ordered her transferred to a special all female penal farm, in a remote area of Yucatan Province. Inmates were forced to work a fourteen hour, seven day schedule manually harvesting various crops.
Conversation between inmates was prohibited and they were continuously observed by sadistic guards, if any violations were observed the inmate would be immediately flogged. The inmates continuously were shackled with steel leg irons, with a chain just long enough to permit walking but preventing running. Occasionally the guards were permitted to use the inmates for oral sex, with no other type of sex permitted.
At the end of the work day each inmate was placed in a cell, designed to prevent any interaction amongst the inmates. It was in effect solitary confinement, only with hard labor. Inmates were allowed to write letters to relatives and were not allowed to identify the location of the prison. �State security� was the criteria for assignment to this prison, but in reality most of the inmates had somehow incurred the disfavor of the cartel hierarchy.
Brianna exerted tremendous influence over Gomez and decided that another female should be abducted, along with Juanita they were satisfy the sadistic desires of the pair. Gomez acquiesced, although somewhat reluctantly. KIdnappings, especially for ransom, were ubiquitous in Mexico. Often girl friends of a smaller cartel member were the target. It was a risky endeavor, for once the ransom was paid the cartel frequently retaliated violently against the suspected kidnappers, and the targets sometimes had no involvement in the affair.
Gomez selected the nineteen year old daughter of the mayor of a small city approximately one hundred miles from the compound. The mayor was regarded as not susceptible to bribery by the cartel, and her kidnapping would send a message to others who might be of similar persuasion.
Three goons were tasked with the abduction. The technique was not particularly imaginative, and was accomplished by forcing the victim&#8217;s car off the road, in broad daylight, on a semi rural stretch of highway. Cassandra was dragged screaming from her car and thrown into the rear of an SUV. She was promptly hogtied using plastic handcuffs, gagged with duct tape and a hood placed over her head.
Cassandra continued her futile struggling as the SUV began the sixty minute drive to the compound, with the hog tie connected to a ring on the floor, preventing any thrashing about. Gomez and Brianna were waiting as the vehicle entered the walled compound, coming to a stop at the front entrance to the mansion.
Brianna eagerly looked forward to her role as a dominatrix for the two slaves. She was well aware of Gomez&#8217; sadistic and mercurial personality, as Juanita had discovered, but was confident of her ability to manipulate him. Brianna had already decreed the two slaves would be kept locked, in separate rooms, until they had attained the required degree of obedience. 
Brianna and Gomez had different plans for the future of the two slaves. Brianna wanted to train the two as pony girls and keep them for her use, while Gomez intended to sell Cassandra to a buyer in a Central American country such as Honduras. His reasoning was that inevitably Mexican police would learn that Cassandra was being held at the compound, and attempt a rescue. Juanita would be held indefinitely at the compound, as she was not a high value victim.&nbsp; Brianna and Gomez would ultimately clash over the issue.
Cassandra had been able to remove her hood during transport, but was unable to remove the duct tape which was wrapped around her head. Gomez had ordered that her mouth not be stuffed with any object as the risk of suffocation was too great. The duct tape was sufficient to keep her quiet and it wasn&#8217;t essential that she be blindfolded, the purpose was to keep her terrified during transport.

Cassandra was full figured and big breasted, when captured she was wearing denim shorts and a white tank top.
. Brianna eagerly cut away her ankle bindings, before removing her shorts, top and underwear. Leaving the gag in place for the time being, Brianna took a six foot leash, wrapped one end of it around her neck, and then led her to the basement with the leash.
Brianna informed Cassandra of the reason for the abduction. It was not for ransom, but Cassandra along with Juanita, would be trained as pony girls and consigned to a life of slavery. The duct tape was removed from her mouth and she was fitted with a padlocked steel collar. As the mansion did not have a specially designed dungeon, a ten foot heavy duty chain was connected to the steel collar, and the other end to a wall pipe. Ignoring her protests, she was left alone in the dank and windowless basement. A heavily reinforced wooden door which locked from the exterior, assured that escape was impossible.
Feuding between Gomez and Brianna began immediately, with Gomez making clear he had no intention of training two pony girls. Cassandra, after training would be sold to a Honduran buyer, while Juanita would continue as the personal slave of the couple.
Brianna had dangerously overestimated her ability to manipulate Gomez to conform to her wishes. She then bluntly told Gomez that if Cassandra were sold, Brianna would leave and reestablish her relationship with a previous lover.
Such contemptuous behavior was simply intolerable to Gomez and his reaction was swift. Brianna would be sent to one of the state prisons. After a brief profanity laced struggle, she was subdued and taken to the basement, which would be shared with Cassandra. Brianna had her wrists cuffed behind her, to a pole on the opposite side of the basement, while a muzzle gag was used to prevent any conversation on her part. Fortunately she was not within reach of Cassandra, who might have used her bare hands to inflict violence upon her former captor.
Juanita was in a state of disbelief when informed by Gomez that her status would now be that of lover, rather than house slave. She despised this monster, fearing that upon some whim, he would revert to enslavement and torture once gain. However she knew Gomez was quite capable of satisfying her sexual desires, and while not a nymphomaniac, prolonged denial was acutely distressing.
Gomez assured her that she would not be required to participate in lesbian sex, but was free to use either Brianna or Cassandra for that purpose, should she desire. Juanita declined and was soon engaged in passionate coital sex with Gomez, who found her erotic responses to be immensely pleasurable. The first session was a marathon lasting nearly an hour, with Gomez riding her like a bull, and her cries of passion echoing beyond the confines of the bedroom wall.
Brianna was disposed of within three days. A prison van was driven into the compound, and two dykish uniformed guards emerged. The prisoner was still confined in the basement, wearing a two piece black vinyl dominatrix outfit. She was still wearing her muzzle gag, with the ball portion removed only briefly to permit her being fed. The male servant had been tasked with providing a bucket for her toilet needs.
After removing the handcuffs, Brianna was quickly and efficiently shackled, using standard prisoner transport manacles. The gag was removed which prompted a final outpouring of invectives against Gomez. The two transport guards led her to the waiting van and she was placed in the rear, where she would be the only prisoner. �We have special accommodations for mouthy bitches�, snarled the older guard. Instead of being allowed to sit on the bench, Brianna was forced to kneel upon the floor, with cable ties used to secure the manacles, in such a manner that Brianna would be forced to remain in an uncomfortable kneeling position for the duration of the trip.
Ignoring Brianna&#8217;s protests, the guards piped loud music into the prisoner compartment, which muffled any of her sounds and only exacerbated the discomfort of kneeling. Brianna would soon be an inmate of Prison 14, where Angela had previously been held. The records were fabricated to show that she was serving a ten year sentence on a narcotics change.
 The benevolent warden, who had served when Angela was housed there, had been reassigned. Her replacement was a middle aged lesbian, with a reputation for cruelty and using female prisoners sexually. Brianna would be held for an indefinite period in solitary confinement and not allowed to communicate with anyone on the outside. Only a select few had knowledge of her whereabouts, and officially her name would not appear on the public prisoner register.
Nancy was the only female, involved with the cartel, for which the story has a happy ending. Diego honored his agreement not to torture or sexually use the captive, pending her return to the United States. She was provided with her own room, allowed to perform personal hygiene by herself, and provided with adequate nutrition. The only person she was allowed to see was Diego, who uncharacteristically took a rather paternalistic interest in her.
Three days after her rescue from Mistress Camella at the brothel, an unmarked American aircraft flew her from a remote Mexican landing strip, to an equally remote landing strip in Arizona. Carla accompanied the pilot and consoled Nancy during the sixty minute flight.
After extensive debriefing Nancy, was given a new identity and relocated, under a special witness protection program. She is not allowed to speak of her ordeal in Mexico, and presently works in the publishing industry in New York City. Her employer is an alumnus of the intelligence community but is not aware of the specifics of Nancy&#8217;s case.
Cassandra proved quite problematic for Diego. She was especially resistant to oral sex and special training techniques had to be employed. These included involuntary mouth fucking while wearing a ring gag and being tied in a kneeling position, facing a pole for several hours, while being forced to continuously suck on a huge dildo mounted on the pole. Much to her relief, Juanita was not forced to participate or observe the training. Cassandra was eventually sold to a Honduran buyer.
Angela continues to toil in hard labor, at a remote penal colony, with no indication when, if ever, she might be released.
Brianna faces an uncertain future. She quickly incurred the wrath of the prison warden for her defiant attitude. To make an example of her, the warden ordered her flogged in the presence of the other inmates Most of her time has been spent in solitary confinement.
Gomez had a tentative agreement to sell Brianna to a buyer in Nigeria, only to have it fall through at the last minute. He is currently attempting to negotiate a sale with a buyer in Gabon.
