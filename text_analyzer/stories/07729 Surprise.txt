Synopsis: A self-bondage adventure turns out more intense than originally planned.






Surprise

by Christiana Lecker



The room is filled with the warm glow of six flickering candles, and I hum a soft tune while I make the final decorations. Four of the candles are on holders on each wall to light the room, two on the side table waiting for a different use. I've been working since lunch time, moving furniture, putting photos of us two everywhere and making the dining room a special place for a special evening. I smile thinking of you while I put a transparent plastic cloth over the low table and, not without effort, lift the heavy bondage device onto it.



"Thank god I'm nude, or I'd be sweating by this time," I think and admire my setup. My thoughts drift to you, and a wonderful shiver runs up my spine in anticipation. The device, for lack of a better name, is a brilliant, devious self bondage device that I had custom made without you knowing. My fingers trail the intricate wrought iron frame in admiration, the words 'pain' and 'pleasure' woven into beautiful ornaments. I glance to the clock and smile again before putting it on the side table face down. It's time.



I plug the power cord into the outlet, carry the two candles to the table, let my eyes roam over the room in a last scrutinizing glance and nod. Climbing up to the table is a bit awkward, but you know just how hot feeling awkward can make me. I rub my thighs together. Then, kneeling down on the device's base plate, I spread my legs wide and put my knees on the padded rests. You're going to love that view, I know it, and I glance at the door straight ahead through which you will come soon. My fingers, a bit clumsily, fasten the straps around my lower legs that will hold my knees in place.



I sit down, my thighs spread obscenely, and my butt touches the other padded rest. I shiver as my back makes contact with the cold iron frame. The ornaments and little knubs will make my time rather uncomfortable, I realize, even more than I had planned. But there's no way back now. I fasten a broader strap around my stomach that pulles me back and downwards and pull it tight, almost painfully so. I shiver again. This time not only from the cold.



My hands pick up the seesaw, the most ingenious part of the setup, and I can't help but grin proudly. I invented this myself, for you. I'm curious what descriptions you will have for it, and I pray that 'wonderful' and 'wicked' and 'brilliant' will be among them. I tremble a bit as I put the pole of the seesaw in the hole in the bottom plate and hear the ratchet lock it in place, the sound echoing like thunder in the silent house.



A small red LED on the motor unit at the top of the pole shows me it is ready, and my fingers tremble slightly as I lift the two candles and mount them on their places at each end of the horizontal part of the seesaw, making sure they can't come loose. Just a few inches away, two inches above my breasts, I can feel their warmth in my face. I smile and wince at the same time, fearing and wanting the inevitable pain, my gift for you.



Another strap goes around my neck and makes my upper body completely immobile. My finger presses the 'start' button on the seesaw control, and it tilts to one side, the candle on the lowered end slightly inclining towards me, so the flame is well above my breast. Both candles start to rotate slowly, and I close my eyes and take in a deep breath to gather my resolve. It won't be long now.



My arms reach backwards and my wrists find the shackles. Quickly, so I can't change my mind, I push them into the shackles which snap shut with a loud sound and entrap me completely. Only once thing left to do. I breath hard and raise my arms behind my back as high as I can. The rod to which the shackles are attached rotates upwards with a ratcheting sound, and my breasts are pushed foreward. My shoulders protest against this position, but it's too late, I can't put my arms down anymore try as I might.



I wince, and then I think about the sight waiting for you. My nude body, shimmering in the soft candle glow, bound like this for your pleasure. My lower lips slighly open from my legs being spread so wide, my tits jutting out invitingly, unable to move away. I lost track of the time, and suddenly a hot stinging runs through my left&nbsp; breast and makes me shriek in surprise. Quickly I press my lips shut and look down. A splotch of red wax is slowly drying on my skin. A second later, another one drips down from the candle, hits my senitive breast and gives me a slight but very uncomfortable burn.



The seesaw makes a whirring noise and tilts to the other side, straightening the left candle and tilting the right one towards me. This time it doesn't take long for the first drop to fall. I wince and moan, and my eyes instinctively seek for the clock, then I remember. I planned it as part of the torture, not being able to see the time hightens the intensity. I guess it will be fifteen minutes. You tend to be on time.



Drop after drop lands on my skin, alternating between my breasts every half minute. I lost count how often it did that. I'm shivering, and my tits feel hot and swollen and have started to pulsate. The candles have burnt down quite a bit, the drops getting closer and closer to my erect nipples. I moan quietly, and I futilely try to alleviate some of the strain in my arms and legs. How long has it been? A short burst of panik runs through me, what if something happened to you on your way home and you got delayed? How long can I stay like that before serious cramping will set in? A hot, searing pain shoots through my right nipple, and I shriek and try to thrash in my bonds.



In just that moment the door swings open, and my head shoots up to look. I'm somewhat dazed and squinting at the bright light coming in from the corridor, and I wonder how I could have missed you entering the house. Then I notice you are talking to someone else. '...sure you'll like her. She's such a sweetheart, I can...' 



Your words fade as you take in the sight. I try to smile at you, but a drop of wax hits my left nipple and I gasp loud. I see your eyes become big and I grin proudly. Another drop, another gasp, and you smile too. Just then another face appears behind your shoulder, big eyes, delicate lips and reddish blond curls, a woman I don't know, and I suddenly realize the state I'm in. A stranger! I panic for a moment, god, why didn't I give you at least a hint? I should have thought of that!



I don't think I've ever felt as self conscious and nude as right now. What will she think of me, and by extension, of you? You walk into the room and smile at me assuringly, then turn around and gesture your friend to enter. I wish to sink into the ground. She takes a few hesitant steps, then stands and looks me up and down with bright eyes. I flush all over, my whole body glowing just as red as the burning skin on my tits. I try to stammer a greeting, but no words come out.



A devilish smile dances over your lips, then softens as you turn to your friend again. 'Helena,' you say and lift your eyebrows, 'meet my lover and, as you will undoubtedly have guessed by now, also my submissive, Chrissy.'



Your friend looks back and forth between us two a number of times, raises a questioning eyebrow towards you that is answered with a nod, then steps closer and begins to smile. I look back a little fearful.



She extends well-manicured fingers towards me and begins to roam over my upper leg, her eyes looking deeply into mine. "You didn't exaggerate," she tells you, "she's a looker."



Her fingers trail closer towards my wet snatch, and I gasp. "Now don't you usually greet guests, Chrissy?" You ask with a slightly sharp tone and I feel even smaller than I was already. "He.. Hello Miss Helena," I stutter with a hoarse, trembling voice, "it's - it's nice to meet you."



She smiles brightly at me and begins to caress both of my thighs, and after a few strokes I'm torn between shame and lust. In the mean time, you have stepped behind me and are kneeling on the table now, close to my back. You lower your hips so your crotch rests on my extended, bound arms, and your own arms extend around my upper body.



"You're so sweet," you whisper into my ear and I feel like flying at your praise, "have no fear, just go with the flow." Your skilled fingers find the switch on the seesaw and turn it off, and I'm expecting the straps around my body to come loose. Instead, you pick up the candles and bite my earlobe playfully.



"Be careful." You say, and for a moment I'm lost, until I realize you spoke to Helena.



Then you move the candles down and hold them close above my snatch. Helena's fingers pull my pussy lips apart, exposing my glistening womanhood and my erect clit. Her eyes look up and she whispers: "Make her beg for it."



I shiver as your soft warm tongue trails circles in my ear. "Beg for it," you whisper, and your hands with the candles leave now doubt to what 'it' is. 



My brain screams 'No!' and fresh sweat assembles on my forehead, but my body is on autopilot. "Please," I beg with a small girl's voice, "please Mistress, do it!"



Seconds trickle by, and I realize that you haven't found my begging sufficient. 



"Please, Mistress, please," it takes a lot out of me to say those words, "trickle hot wax onto my sensitive clitty!"



Helena smiles brightly, her eyes roaming between my face and spread pussy. "If you wish so." You purr and tilt both candles at the same time. The wax swaps over and lands directly on my clit, searing heat shoots through it and through my pussy lips which get coated by rivulets of the hot liquid. I cry out and feel a tear trickle down my face. 



Helena bends down and begins to blow on my pussy. It takes away some of the heat and pain, and I smile gratefully at her.



The candles vanish from my sight, and I can hear you extinguishing them. Then your hands roam over my breasts, and your fingernails begin to slowly peel away the wax, inch by inch. It hurts, but in a good way, and I gasp. Helena's fingers also begin to peel away wax, and I gasp louder. My pussy and tits become a big, hot, throbbing union of lust. Waves start to run all over me, and I tremble and moan. You fingernails dig deeper into my inflamed skin, as do Helena's, and I close my eyes, let myself fall into the lust.



Suddenly you both tug at the remaining wax and send a short but intense stab of pain through my tits and clit. My eyes flutter open, and I give a guttural cry as I'm pushed over the cliff. A tremendous wave of lust washes me away, stars explode and wonderful shockwaves race through my body. Fingernails pinch my clit and pull my nipples and prolong the ride, and I lose time and space.



* * *



Minutes later, I'm free of my bonds and reclining on the couch, my head resting in your lap, and I'm smiling like the cheshire cat.



"Why didn't you give a hint that you've got something planned for the two of us," you ask me.



"I - I wanted it to be a real surprise, Mistress, it's been two years today that we've met." I blush a bit and hope you won't take it as criticism that you didn't remember.



You smile at me. "A tiny hint wouldn't have hurt," you whisper, then pause and look into my eyes, "but, speaking of hurting..."



You trail off and stare thoughtfully into space. "Yes, Mistress?" I ask.



Glancing towards Helena, whose fingers are trailing idle circles on my thighs, you nod, and I understand. My fingers wrap around Helena's hand and bring it to my mouth, and I kiss her palm.



You smile at me tenderly, caress my cheek and whisper "Thank you", and I'm happy.
