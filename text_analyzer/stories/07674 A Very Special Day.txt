A Very Special Day

Synopsis: 






I first met Annette a few months ago, through work, and I was instantly attracted to her. She's gorgeous, bright, kind, and in short the perfect woman. I vividly remember the moment we first met, and the months I spent obsessing over her since then. I can't put into words the overwhelming thoughts and feelings coarsing through me now, as I kneel at her feet for the first time, naked, shaking, looking up at this amazing woman who has just made me Hers. 
......

Annette is actually the person who got me my new job. Even though she's two years younger than me, at only 24 she's already an assistant manager of the department, and figures to move up the ladder quickly. I instantly took to working for her,�at first because I believed in the work we were doing, and�soon simply because everything about giving her what she wanted felt right. �
She was undeniably pretty, with soft, pale skin, dark hair and big green eyes. She moved with the confidance and grace of someone who knew how exceptional she was, but treated everyone she met with respect and kindness. She was married, but even if he hadn't been I never would have thought I'd have a chance with a woman like her. But�for reasons I still don't understand, she took a liking to me. Her devotion to work, and my devotion to her, made for many long nights in the office with just the two of us.�We would talk about work, and life, and when we did she would often speak softly to me, leaning over a table to lightly tough my forearm, or let her knee graze against mine. Tonight had started just like that. 
She was sitting next to me at a large oak table in the conference room, long after everyone but the janitorial staff had left for the night. As we both looked over a report I had put together that day, she leaned in to me, her shoulder touching mine, and softly said "You really did some nice work on this part, Nick" leaning over and pointing to a graph I had made,��I'm proud of you."� I don't hide my emotions well, and even this minor compliment left me looking up at her adoringly,�blushing, and stammering�"Thanks, Annette" I'm sure the way I felt about her was written all over my face. She looked into my eyes and smiled.�In that moment, it felt like she could read my mind. And not only did she not pity me, a pathetic�older man so completely smitten with a woman I could never have, but she actually seemed to be pleased. I melted. I would have done anything for her right then, and she knew it. "Call me Miss Hanson, Nick. I AM your boss, you know." She giggled a little, tilted her head and looked at me, waiting.�� 
"Yes, Miss Hanson", I whispered.
She smiled at me again, and then stood and slowly walked across the room and pushed the door shut. I couldn't help but stare at her as she walked, her long cotton skirt fluttering behind her, tightening up and hugging her hips at the top, her thick�black hair pulled up in a loose bun, showing her long, delicate neck and smooth shoulders. She turned to face me. 
�
"You like me, don't you Nick?" 
"Of course, Miss Hanson." I replied. 
"You know that's not what I mean. You REALLY like me, don't you?" she asked, like she already knew the answer. I looked at her, not sure how to reply.� "It's ok, Nick. You can tell me."
I looked down at the floor and answered. "I really like you, Miss Hanson.." 
She reached under my chin and tilted my head up to face hers. She had a big smile on her face, and a little glint in her eyes. She didn't have to say anything. All it took was that look on her face and to tell me she knew just how I felt about her, and that she appreciated it. 
"There's a lot you don't know about me, Nick. Tell me, do you know much about Mistress/slave relationships?"
I nodded. "A little, Miss Hanson. Just what I've read online, though."
"Good. And you like what you've heard, right?" Again, she didn't need to ask, but she waited for my response. 
"Yes, Miss Hanson" I muttered. She smiled at me again, reaching out and lightly brushing my cheek with her hand. 
"I'm so happy to hear that."� She paused,�and began circling me as I sat.�"My husband is submissive to me, you know. For as long as I can remember, I've always wanted to be served...to have a man who loved me so much that he would gladly do anything I asked of him, just to make me happy. It took me so long to find someone who could be that person for me. When I finally met him, I fell for him right away.� He was so happy to be with me that he gave me almost complete contol of his life. He does every single thing I ask of him. Even if it means giving me control of each and every one of his orgasms, or watching as another man fucks the woman he loves, and cleaning up after him. He does it because he wants to, because he know it makes me happy. No matter how frustrating or humiliating it is to him, he does it for me." 
She trailed off and stopped in front of me, lightly biting her�her bottom lip. For a second, I thought she might be a little nervous about what she was about to say.
"You remind me of him, you know. Most men would be afraid to admit it, but I think you'd enjoy a life like that.��� Wouldn't you?"
"Y-yes"� I whispered. 
"Yes....?�she asked, running her hand through my hair, tugging on it�ever so slightly when she reached the back.
"....Yes Miss Hanson?" I replied.
"Good. Stand up." Any sign of nervousness disappeared from her face and her voice picked up a slight edge to it. I stood quickly, not daring to look her in the eyes, for fear of breaking the moment and ruining my chance.� "Now, take off your clothes." she ordered, kindly, but with a tone that implied unpleasant consequences if I backed out now. 
I looked up at her questioningly, to make sure I should continue. 
"Well?" she asked, hands on her hips. 
I fumbled with the buttons on my shirt, trying to get it off faster than my fingers would allow, and eventually pulled it off. My pants followed, dropping to the ground around my ankles. I stepped out of them quietly. 
"The boxers too, Nick." she said, noticing the small bulge growing underneath. "Lets see what we're working with." 
I pulled the elastic waist of my underwear over my half-limp cock, and she purred happily as it popped into view and I pulled the shorts down. She circled me again, this time slowly running her eyes up and down my body. As she ran her warm hand against my exposed ass, electricity ran through my body. When she reached the front and caressed my throbbing penis for the first time, I thought I would faint. 
"Good boy." she cooed in my ear. "This just might work out. Now, get on your knees." 
I lowered myself to the floor, and as I kneeled there in front of her, my skin now bright red with excitement and embarassment, she slipped her right hand into the waist of her skirt. "Masturbate for me." she ordered. I tentatively�wrapped a hand around�my cock and began sliding up and down the growing rod. She sat down in the chair across from me and her hand disappeared underneath the hem of her flowing skirt, exposing the insides of her milky thighs. "Slower, Nick. Its no fun if I can't see what you're doing."�� Knowing that my minor humiliation was turning her on excited me, and a deep moan escaped my lips as I knelt, transfixed on the movement under her skirt. "You're doing�very well, Nick." She�ran her other hand�up her leg, and when it came out she was holding a pair of black lace panties.�She�tossed them to the ground in front of me,�watching my eyes as I stared down at the wet spot on her discarded underwear. "Go ahead," she said, as if she was reading my mind. "But don't stop playing with yourself."
I reached out with my right hand and slowly brought the panties up to my face,�at first just staring at the damp fabric, then pressing it against my�nose and inhaling,�suddenly stroking faster.
She groaned softly under her breath, sleepily watching me and playing with herself�as I knelt on the office floor, head bowed, greedily smelling her scent. "You can taste them, if you like," she offered. I immideately slipped the wet spot past my lips and began sucking deeply, eager to taste every bit of it, shocked at how quickly I'd slipped into to such a desperately�horny state.�It�had been a long day, and the mixture of her sweat and her sex that had permeated the fabric tasted like heaven.��I felt her eyes lazily wandering around my naked body,�felt myself growing more and more eager�for her to take total control,�my hand pumping my cock faster, in time with the�rapidly increasing movement under her skirt. �My balls began to�tighten as the head of my cock grew swollen and purple,�precum oozing out of�the tip.
"Are you close to cumming, sweetie?" she asked, and I nodded quickly, my head spinning and�tunnel vision blocking out every sight but her.
She stood and�walked over to me, grabbing my hand and slowly pulling it off my cock. "Well that will have to wait, boy. I need you now." She�cupped her hand on the back of my head and grabbed a handful of hair, looking�down at me with obvious lust�in her�eyes, her other hand rubbing herself through the outside of her skirt as she led me over to her chair. 
She sat and leaned back, spreading her milky white legs and guiding my head into the dark, warm world between them. She forcefully pressed my face against her, and her thighs clamped around my head as I eagerly sucked the juices�that were�flowing from her warm, wet �pussy. I didn't have much experience with my tongue, but my excitement more than made up for that shortcoming as I desperately licked and sucked, my nose buried in her pubic hair, surrounded by that beautiful taste and intoxicating smell. I could hear her moaning and feel her pulling my face deeper, until I could barely breathe, muttering to me in frantic, panting breaths "mmm....god yes...such a good little slut...faster....faster!...UNGGGGGGG!!!!!!" her pussy contracted around my probing tongue, her juices gushing out of her, pouring down my throat. Everything in the world ceased existing outside of her vagina and the swelling I felt in my chest knowing that I was helping bring her to an orgasm. 
Her body went slack as I continued slurping and sucking ever ounce out of her I could, my hand still rapidly stroking my cock, trying to hold back my own orgasm. Eventually she gently pushed my head back and looked down at me, my face glistening with her juice. 
"You've done very well, sweetie" she cooed, smiling down at me again, enjoying the lust in my eyes and the desperate twitching of my strained penis. "I think you've earned a treat. Lay down on the table." 
I quickly scrambled up from the floor and lay on my back across the big, polished conference room table, my knees in the air and legs spread. 
"Hmmm...very nice. I like you in this position." she said as her head appeared over me, and she stuffed her discarded panties in my mouth once again. "Start stroking again. When you're ready to cum, lift your ass up off the table to let me know." 
I began stroking my cock again, looking up a the celing and imagining her eyes on me. She disappeared from my view and I heard her rustling around somewhere in the back of the room. My balls began to throb and I could feel my orgasm coming in a massive wave, about to overtake me competely. I honestly don't think I could have stopped this one, and as I thrust my cock into the air, she appeard above me again and pulled the panties out of my mouth. I saw her bring a small digital camera up to her face as she said "Cum for me now. In your mouth." Before I even had a second to think about it, my body tensed up and�my long swollen cock began spurting string after string of thick,��sticky cum all over my chest, face and mouth. I lay there, exhausted and spread-eagled on the table as she continuted snapping pictures of my shrinking cock and glistening, cum-covered face.
�
......

Before I had time to recover from my orgasm, she ordered me back to the floor, which is where I find myself now, kneeling at her feet.
"You were a very good boy tonight, nick. You have no idea how happy I am that you've performed so well. I knew�I had good reason to like you."�
"Thank you, Miss�Hanson" I reply proudly. 
"You understand that these pictures are my property, to share with whomever I wish?"
"Yes Miss Hanson."
"Good. Now, this may be hard to hear, but you know that I will never love�you like I love my husband,�don't you nick? That no matter how fond of you, my heart will always be with him?"
"Yes Miss," I answer.��
�"And you know that in spite of that, if we continue, you will have to remain faithful to me at all times, and do everything for me that he does, and possibly more?" 
"Yes Miss" I answer again, not immediately comprehending the ramifications of what I'm so readily agreeing to. 
"And do you wish to continue?" she asks me, with a hint of hope in her voice
"Yes, Miss Hanson." I answer
She's smiling at me again, her face glowing with pride. She leans in and kisses me on the cheek, then�whispers in my ear...�"Ask me for it. Beg me" she taunts me.
"Please Miss Hanson, please�let me serve you. I've never wanted�anything more than I want this."� I wait desperately for her reply, as she slowly walks across the room and picks up her�discarded panties. 
She seems to think for a second, then tosses me her underwear. "Wear these tomorrow" she says to me as she gathers her things together and heads towards the door. "When we're done with work, you can come over to my house to meet Bill.� I know he'll be happy to hear it's worked out so well.�I told him all about you, and�he's always wanted to be the one watching some willing boy clean up his mess."
�
"See you at Eight" she says over he shoulder as she closes the door behind her. I'm left here on the floor, alone, and my only thoughts are of what just happened tonight, and�fantasies of�what will happen tomorrow.
