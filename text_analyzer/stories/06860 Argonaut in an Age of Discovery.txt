Argonaut in an Age of Discovery

Chapter 1: Gathering Clouds

The Argo, there it was in its berth in the marina in Baltimore Harbor, a sailing yacht, pale blue-grey, a humble vessel with a presumptuous name.&nbsp; Compared to the nearby gleaming white yachts, it looked old, dingy, and perhaps small for accommodating six people.

Carrying my heavy bag down the dock, I saw April on the deck, at the same time as she saw me.&nbsp; She called out, and I waved.&nbsp; April was the friend who had invited me on this trip.&nbsp; She&#8217;s a tall, buxom, hazel blond, with an earthy manner that disguises her intelligence.&nbsp; She&#8217;s been in many of my high school classes, and like me, just graduated.

Actually, I had been invited on this yacht trip only as a last-minute replacement for my good friend Diana, who had canceled just two days before departure.&nbsp; She had just been offered a job as a summer intern with a local law firm, an opportunity she had no wish to decline.

I, on the other hand, was spending my summer writing for a twelve-page, free, alternative-viewpoint, �independent media� newspaper called the New Columbia Free Press, where �Columbia� refers to the U.S. capitol district.&nbsp; Published twice monthly using a grant from a foundation, it accepted no advertisements and thus could not pay its staff, all spare-time volunteers.&nbsp; While the work experience was exceptional, with a steep learning curve, I was happy to take time off for a trip on a sailing yacht, something totally new to me.&nbsp; I imagined it being very romantic.

A man standing on the dock beside the boat addressed me, �So you&#8217;re Jenny.&nbsp; I&#8217;m Roscoe, the skipper of this boat.�

Eeyew...&nbsp; I could smell the alcohol on his breath.&nbsp; And the way he looked me over.&nbsp; It felt like he was taking my clothes off with his eyes.&nbsp; Was this loathsome creature going to accompany us on this voyage?

Unfortunately, the answer was yes.&nbsp; It was his boat.&nbsp; A distant relative of April, he was a sun-wrinkled man with grey hair.&nbsp; Although he was lean, his posture was often somewhat hunched, as if decadent living and too much booze had taken a toll.

On board, I met the third girl, Ivy.&nbsp; She&#8217;s a second-cousin of April and three years older than us.&nbsp; Goes to George Washington University.&nbsp; Extremely pretty and poised, she&#8217;s of medium height, a little taller than me.&nbsp; Slender, but nicely rounded in the right places.&nbsp; Light brown hair, with blond accents.&nbsp; During the voyage, she spent a lot of time in front of the mirror grooming herself.&nbsp; I guess it pays off; she is striking.

A half hour later, with a large baggage cart overloaded with food supplies April and Roscoe had ordered, came James, a big, tall, hairy macho-man in his mid-twenties.&nbsp; He is the kind of guy who has a five-o&#8217;clock shadow even after he shaves.&nbsp; After our initial greeting, he rarely spoke to me.&nbsp; But then, I guess I had little to say to him either.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t follow sports, which is about all he talked about.&nbsp; James took an immediate interest in trying to make it with April.

Last came Rafiq.&nbsp; Age 24, half Lebanese Sunni, half French, spent his early childhood in both Paris and Beirut, and his adolescence mostly in London, went to college in New York City, and was now working as an economist at the World Bank headquarters in Washington.&nbsp; He struck me as a true world citizen, his perspective not constrained by any one region.

Rafiq was well read and knowledgeable, yet appreciative of different points of view.&nbsp; His quiet seriousness was punctuated with an irreverent humor.&nbsp; I liked being around him.

And he seemed to enjoy talking to me.&nbsp; But I had no romantic designs on him; he was Ivy&#8217;s boy friend.&nbsp; I simply thought of Rafiq and Ivy as a couple, and I as a younger friend.&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet in those first two days of the voyage, I felt such a rapport with him that I almost felt like we could be cousins.

The peculiar thing about him working for the World Bank was that together with an older mentor I had just written an article in the New Columbia Free Press about the heavy-handed tactics that the DC police chief had employed that year against World Bank protestors.

I was excited to meet someone who actually worked for the World Bank.&nbsp; And Rafiq was interested in my summer work at the New Columbia Free Press.&nbsp; He knew of the newspaper, even though it is only distributed though certain bookstores and coffeehouses.&nbsp; But he had not seen the most recent issue with my article in it.&nbsp; I remedied that by bringing out a copy that I �just happened to have� in my luggage.&nbsp; Obviously I was delighted that he was interested in what I had written.

I was surprised how sympathetic Rafiq was with the demonstrators against the World Bank.&nbsp; He was not the least bit defensive about criticism of his organization.&nbsp; And yet, as I think back on it, although he sometimes poked fun at the World Bank, not once did he acknowledge the validity of the demonstrators&#8217; criticisms.&nbsp; In his quiet manner, he walked me through the complexities of some of the issues with Third World economies, as well as the entrenched inequities between rich and poor nations.

Yet he was in no way condescending about my comparative ignorance.&nbsp; Rather he seemed appreciative of my interest.&nbsp; Our general social-political orientations matched.

*********

In the beginning the girls and guys slept in separate compartments.&nbsp; Ours was a little bedroom.&nbsp; The guys&#8217; was the common room, basically a small living room for everyone.&nbsp; Everything was very compact.

On the first night at sea, April, Ivy, and I arranged the narrow mattresses on the floor so that we could all cuddle together.&nbsp; I had recently enjoyed sexual relations with my close friend Diana (who I&#8217;ve mentioned in previous stories), and was pleased to find that neither April nor Ivy had reservations about bisexuality.&nbsp; During that first night it seemed that we were going to have a great time together during the voyage.

On the following night, Ivy suggested that we shave each other&#8217;s pubic hair.&nbsp; At first a bit reluctant, I ended up agreeing to it.&nbsp; Ivy shaved both April and me.&nbsp; April, after some coaxing, shaved Ivy.

It feels a little strange at first to be completely smooth in places where you have become used to having hair.&nbsp; On the other hand, it was nice to kiss and caress each other&#8217;s smoothness.&nbsp; That second night we again enjoyed each others bodies.&nbsp; We slept cuddled together, April in the middle, Ivy and I on either side.

That idyllic atmosphere was not to last.&nbsp; Late in the morning the next day I was again chatting with Rafiq.&nbsp; We talked about a book we had both read, Dark Continent, an interpretative history of Europe&#8217;s twentieth-century.

From Europe&#8217;s cataclysmic difficulties in accommodating its minorities in the first half of the twentieth century, our conversation turned to the close-to-home intolerance of nonconformity in what seemed at that time (a few years ago) to be an incipient devolution into a Christian theocracy.&nbsp; Later Rafiq turned the conversation to Islam, and finally to Hinduism, about which I didn&#8217;t know much.&nbsp; But I mentioned that I had been taking yoga classes.&nbsp; Rafiq was interested and I started showing him how to do some of the postures.

I felt a bit self conscious at times the way he was watching me.&nbsp; When I was showing him the �Salute to the Sun�, I thought he had seen down my top, but at the time I attributed that to my not managing my clothes appropriately rather than any intentionality on his part.

It seemed to be making Ivy uptight for me to click so well with her boyfriend.&nbsp; She often hovered nearby, but not directly engaged with us.&nbsp; Then she would disappear below for a while, only to reappear some time later acting restless.&nbsp; At such times Rafiq&#8217;s face would cloud just a bit, but mostly he did not acknowledge her concern.

I thought she was acting awfully possessive - hardly the poised and confident demeanor I had previously associated with her.&nbsp; Yet I thought she ought to be able to deal with me talking to her boyfriend.&nbsp; After all, I had no romantic designs on him.&nbsp; I recognized that he was a catch, but he was Ivy&#8217;s catch, not mine.&nbsp; It had not even occurred to me to think of him as a potential boyfriend.&nbsp; In retrospect I think that is why I was so natural and spontaneous with him.

Unlike the previous day, which was cloudy and cool, today was sunny, and as the sun hit its zenith, distinctly hot.&nbsp; Everyone shared a light lunch.

April and Ivy were wearing bikinis.&nbsp; At this point I preferred keeping my shorts on, albeit short ones.&nbsp; Outside the context of the pool or beach, a bikini bottom feels like less clothes than I prefer to have on.&nbsp; And I had on a halter top.&nbsp; It&#8217;s comfortable in the heat, leaving my back bare except for the tie, and covering my bust with airy cotton.

Not surprisingly, in the heat the guys had dispensed with shirts.&nbsp; But I was a little surprised when April and Ivy pealed off their bikini tops.&nbsp; April has a classic womanly figure with an ample bust.&nbsp; Going topless drew James to her like a magnet.&nbsp; He never took his eyes off her.

At this point, the Skipper, drink in hand, hailed me, �Hey, Jenny.&nbsp; When are you going to take your top off?&nbsp; It&#8217;s time to get comfortable.�&nbsp; He passed his hand down my back, giving the tie of my halter top a little tug as he did so.

I dodged quickly away, murmuring, �I&#8217;m feeling comfortable enough now with what I have on.&nbsp; But thank you anyway.�

At this point I withdrew to the bow with a tube of sun screen and a spiritual philosophy book by Krishnamurti, There is No Thinker, Only Thought, loaned to me by my mentor at the New Columbia Free Press.&nbsp; With my back toward the rest of the group in the stern, I tried to read, but was actually turning over in my mind my feelings about needing to be clothed.

I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m a prude.&nbsp; And there is nothing that bad about my body; I weigh the least of the three girls.&nbsp; ...Well, of course Ivy is genuinely striking fully clothed or not.&nbsp; But I&#8217;m not envious of her.&nbsp; I&#8217;m more or less okay with how I look.&nbsp; This clothes issue is that I just don&#8217;t want people&#8217;s eyes all over my body.&nbsp; Maybe I like a little privacy, which clothes provide.

�Heyyy... Jenny.�&nbsp; It was Rafiq behind me.&nbsp; He has this special way of murmuring &#8216;hey&#8217;:&nbsp; quietly, almost conspiratorially, as if you&#8217;re a really special person and he has something really special to share with you.&nbsp; Smiling, I glanced back at him.

�You doing okay?� he asked, sitting down next to me.&nbsp; �I hope the Skipper didn&#8217;t make you uptight about taking your top off.&nbsp; He&#8217;s just an odd character.&nbsp; You&#8217;re fine, top on or off.�

�Thanks.&nbsp; ...I guess I was feeling a little funny about the situation.&nbsp; But it&#8217;s nothing.&nbsp; Just my silly hang-ups.�

�Whatever.&nbsp; But I can relate to how you feel.&nbsp; Whether you&#8217;re a guy or a girl, we&#8217;re all accustomed to clothes.&nbsp;&nbsp; ...By the way, your back is looking a little red.&nbsp; You need more sun screen.�

�Uh-oh.&nbsp; I really don&#8217;t want to get burned.&nbsp; It&#8217;s hard for me to get it on all my back; might I ask you to put it on me.� 

He took the tube and proceeded to apply it on my back.&nbsp; I liked his hands on my skin.&nbsp; It took me a little while to realize that he was not applying the lotion in a cooly pragmatic way.&nbsp; He was not minimizing the expressiveness of the contact; he was maximizing it.&nbsp; He was caressing me. 

Taking hold of the tie of my halter top, he said, �Shall I undo this thing?�

To Rafiq, every part of my being was crying yes, yes, yes!&nbsp; �Okay,� I murmured, smiling at him.

He untied the back, and slipped it off my head.&nbsp; Then he gazed at me, alternately looking into my eyes and then at my breasts.&nbsp; �You are extraordinary in so many ways,� he said.

I smiled at him.&nbsp; Then lowered my eyes.&nbsp; I felt self conscious to be bare breasted in front of him.

�By the way, now you&#8217;re going to need some sun screen on your front.�

�Oh, maybe you&#8217;re right.&nbsp; ...But I could do that myself, you know.�

�Yeah, but we&#8217;d both rather that I did it.�

I smiled and said, �What are people going to think?�&nbsp; But still I arched to present my front to him.&nbsp; He proceeded to apply sun screen to my breasts.&nbsp; He paid special attention to my nipples.&nbsp; I was literally squirming with arousal.&nbsp; I could scarcely believe this turn of events.

Although I was basking in Rafiq&#8217;s warmth, still I was not unaware that we must be putting on a bit of a spectacle for the rest of the crew.&nbsp; I glanced back at them.&nbsp; It was Ivy&#8217;s stare that caught my attention.&nbsp; There were daggers in her eyes, directed at me.

*******

Dinner that evening was brief and tense.&nbsp; I had found it convenient to spend most of the time in the galley working while the others were eating.&nbsp; Skipper, and James and April quickly went their separate ways, leaving Ivy and Rafiq alone.&nbsp; Although they seemed to be trying to talk quietly, privacy being a scarce commodity on the boat, I knew there was a drama going on between them.

Having finished cleaning up the galley, I had gone to our compartment.&nbsp; I was lying on my mattress, the top berth, feeling bad about all the trouble I had caused.&nbsp; It was impossible not to hear Ivy&#8217;s rising voice through the partition.&nbsp; I knew their conversation was coming to an end.

Then Ivy burst in and began venting her rage at me. �Bitch!&nbsp; Get out of my room, you rotten little slut!�

�I&#8217;m really sorry, Ivy.�&nbsp; I didn&#8217;t know what to say to try to mollify her.

�Just get out!&nbsp; Get out of my sight.�&nbsp; She glared at me.

I had no wish to remain in the room with her in her current state.&nbsp; But at the same time I didn&#8217;t want her to think she had the authority to order me out.&nbsp; As calmly as a could, I said, �I&#8217;m sorry you&#8217;re angry at me.&nbsp; I didn&#8217;t do anything with the intention of hurting you.&nbsp; But I don&#8217;t mind leaving now.�

I began to slide off the top bunk.&nbsp; Apparently Ivy didn&#8217;t think it was fast enough, for she grabbed my arm, digging her nails into me, and pulled.

Jumping down, I said, �Just keep your hands off me!&nbsp; I&#8217;m leaving, okay?�&nbsp; I faced her momentarily, not wanting to seem like I was running away from her.

She slapped my face.&nbsp; �Ow!&nbsp; Leave me alone,� I said, pushing her away.

She grabbed at my breast and pinched.&nbsp; �Flat-chested slut-girl.&nbsp; You and Rafiq deserve each other.�

�Ouch!&nbsp; You bitch.�&nbsp; I broke her grip and made my exit, thoroughly freaked by her outburst of nastiness.&nbsp; It seemed that her aura of poise and polish is a bit of a facade.&nbsp; If things don&#8217;t go her way, negativity boils out.

However outrageous her behavior was, still I couldn&#8217;t help wondering whether I was in the wrong for having precipitated her breakup with Rafiq.&nbsp; My mind was in turmoil.&nbsp; Who was right?&nbsp; Who was wrong?&nbsp; Was there a right and wrong?

Should I forsake further involvement with Rafiq?&nbsp; Or should I just press forward?&nbsp; Was there really a choice here?&nbsp; Oh... Why does my happiness have to result in someone else&#8217;s distress?&nbsp; Why do things have to be so complicated? 

...Well, in the thick of these imponderables, maybe this is not the best time to divert the reader&#8217;s attention to trivialities.&nbsp; Nevertheless, before I get on with my story, there is one misrepresentation I need to correct.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t think �flat-chested� is an accurate descriptor for me.&nbsp; ...Not that I want to imply that I care how Ivy describes me.&nbsp; ...But I guess I do care, or I wouldn&#8217;t mention it now.

*******

That night I slept on some blankets out on deck.&nbsp; I was a little chilly there, and the deck was hard.&nbsp; I ended up having the strangest dream.&nbsp; I was at a formal prom-like affair, at some place like a fancy waterfront hotel.&nbsp; Except that it seemed to turn into a place that was floating on the water in the middle of the ocean.

I was wearing the most extraordinary silk skirt, with such vividly patterned colors, mostly gold and black and red.&nbsp; It was as beautiful as only something in a dream could be.&nbsp; Its low-riding waist band had this silver chain with dangling jewels: rubies and onyx, not costume jewelry, but the real thing.&nbsp; The skirt was wrap-around, but as nice as it was, it didn&#8217;t have quite enough material to assure that the side stayed closed when I sat down.&nbsp; I couldn&#8217;t be sure that my white cotton undies wouldn&#8217;t be visible, and that would hardly be appropriate for so fancy a skirt.

But that problem pales in comparison to the problem with the top.&nbsp; In the dream I knew I was supposed to have a matching top, a sexy affair that would leave my midriff bare.&nbsp; But somehow or other I ended up without the top &#8211; attending this elegant formal soiree half naked, breasts bared.

A friend of mine, Diana, was praising how good I looked, and at times hugging me and kissing me.&nbsp; Nevertheless, I was really uptight.&nbsp; But nobody else, guys included, were making a big deal out of my attire, or lack thereof.&nbsp; In the dream I felt that this was because they hadn&#8217;t yet noticed my nakedness.&nbsp; I tried to stay close to Diana, hoping that this would somehow protect me.

Then some really handsome guy came up to me, and bending on one knee, took and kissed my hand.&nbsp; In the dream such behavior was not absurd, but seemed natural enough for this unusual guy in this unusual situation.&nbsp; Although he was not Rafiq, I think he represented Rafiq.

He took my hand and led me through the crowd.&nbsp; Still nobody seemed to acknowledge that I was topless, although I remained thoroughly anxious about it.

We went up a couple flights of stairs, through another room crowded with people, then out onto a balcony and down a spiral staircase.&nbsp; He had let go of my hand and gone ahead.&nbsp; But then it felt like it was taking a great effort to move my legs, and I could not keep up with him.&nbsp; The stairs became steeper and I felt that I couldn&#8217;t continue downward without falling.&nbsp; 

I was now all by myself.&nbsp; The staircase had morphed into a rope ladder, and I was now on the bottom rung with nothing below me.&nbsp; The rungs holding my feet separated from each other.&nbsp; It was like standing spreadeagled between two playground swings, one foot on each swing, one hand on each chain - in other words, not much in control.

There were people on the floor far below, looking up at me.&nbsp; At this point in the dream I no longer had any panties on under my skirt, although I remember having had them on earlier.&nbsp; And since the rungs supporting each foot had swung wide apart, I was giving everybody below a good view.

I was being lowered to the floor below.&nbsp; When my feet were less than a meter above the heads of the crowd, my descent stopped.&nbsp; Some people started poking between my legs with poles or broomstick handles.

They were sticking one into my pussy and another one up my butt.&nbsp; It really hurt.&nbsp; I was desperate.&nbsp; There was nothing I could do...

I awoke feeling genuine pain.&nbsp; But that melted away as I realized it was only a dream.&nbsp; I sat up and looked at Rafiq, at the helm.&nbsp; He smiled at me.&nbsp; I got up and cuddled up next to him.

�I had this strange dream.&nbsp; Kind of a bad dream.&nbsp; I was at this big formal party, and people were hurting me.�&nbsp; I chose not to divulge the outre particulars.

�Oh.&nbsp; You&#8217;re probably anxious about the little conflict today.&nbsp; But don&#8217;t worry.&nbsp; Ivy just needed to vent.&nbsp; Things will settle down soon.�&nbsp; Rafiq gave me a kiss on the cheek.

�Do you ever have anxiety dreams where you&#8217;re out in public without clothes?&nbsp; ...Or maybe that&#8217;s just my hangup.�

�At your big formal party, naked?�

�Topless.&nbsp; I had a skirt on, short but elegant.�

�Cute,� said Rafiq, gazing at me with admiration.&nbsp; �I would have liked being in that dream with you.&nbsp; You must have been ravishing...&nbsp; But anyway, yes, I understand that kind of dream.&nbsp; I once dreamt I was giving a presentation to an audience, and my fly was broken and kept being wide open.&nbsp;&nbsp; ...Maybe the prim and righteous don&#8217;t have a monopoly on those kind of anxieties.�

�Prim and righteous?&nbsp; Why do you say that?&nbsp; I don&#8217;t think that applies to me.&nbsp; Except...�

�Except you&#8217;d rather not show too much skin.&nbsp; Otherwise, no, it doesn&#8217;t apply.&nbsp; ...Except there is a certain ...like, aura of virtuousness about you.&nbsp; The kind of things you think are important in the world.&nbsp; Your concern about other people ...and not imposing on other people.�

�Well... but...�

�But yeah, that&#8217;s a different thing,� Rafiq conceded.&nbsp; He pondered for a moment, then said, �Also there&#8217;s your concern about what other people think.&nbsp; That&#8217;s what it is.�&nbsp; He smiled at me.

�Well...�&nbsp; After pausing to ponder, I said, �I know this guy and he once insisted that he never worried about what other people think.&nbsp; And he&#8217;s this totally conventional guy - a conformist, right down to the brand labels on his clothes.&nbsp; So go figure.&nbsp; ...Don&#8217;t you think we&#8217;re all concerned about what other people think?&nbsp; We&#8217;re social creatures.&nbsp; Other people are important.�

�That&#8217;s true.&nbsp; But you do bring it up - what other people think.&nbsp; But it&#8217;s no big deal.&nbsp; Don&#8217;t worry about it.&nbsp; I only mentioned it as a reason why I can picture you having anxiety dreams about not having your clothes on in front of a bunch of people.�

�Oh...&nbsp; Well, maybe I do get too hung up on what other people think.&nbsp; I&#8217;ve got bad habits.�

Rafiq smiled.&nbsp; He gave me a little kiss and said, �I like your bad habits.�&nbsp; He squeezed me close.&nbsp; I rested my head on his shoulder.


*******

The difficulties I had that day with Ivy paled in comparison to what happened late the next day.&nbsp; I was in the galley cooking dinner.&nbsp; In one frying pan there were hamburgers for the omnivores; in the other frying pan there were veggie burgers for the herbivores.&nbsp; Rafiq was in the guys&#8217; compartment, napping, in anticipation of watching the helm that night.

April appeared, telling me to come up quickly to see the dolphins swimming alongside us.&nbsp; I dashed up, forgetting about the stove.&nbsp; In the excitement of watching the dolphins so close, I left the pan on too long and burned the burgers.

The Skipper was angry.&nbsp; �For dereliction of duty, through my authority to discipline the crew under my command, I will administer one dozen strokes with the cat.�

I was appalled.&nbsp; Could he really do that?&nbsp; I had seen �Mutiny on the Bounty�, so I knew that Captain Bligh routinely whipped his crew members.&nbsp; But could this man do that in this day and age?

�Prepare her for the whip.&nbsp; Strip her to the waist,� ordered the Skipper, motioning to April and Ivy.&nbsp; I was wearing an V-front athletic-style swimsuit top.&nbsp; Ivy approached me, intending to strip me of it.&nbsp; I didn&#8217;t want to be forcibly stripped.

Backing away from Ivy, I said, �You have no right.&nbsp; None of you have any right to touch me.�

�Strip off her to top,� repeated the Skipper.

As Ivy closed in, I entreated the Skipper, �Please no.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t want to be handled like that.&nbsp; I&#8217;ll take it off myself.�

The Skipper grunted assent.&nbsp; Ivy frowned at me.&nbsp; Slowly I crossed my arms to take hold of my top from either side.&nbsp; Glancing at the assembled eyes following my every move, I was tempted to turn away from them before lifting off my top.&nbsp; But such modesty felt like it would convey girlish timidity, especially since Ivy and April had already gone topless.

Facing them I pulled my top off overhead.&nbsp; Then I dropped it to the deck and stood facing them with my arms at my sides.&nbsp; I tried to convince myself that it was no big deal if they could look at my bare breasts.

After eyeing my body for several moments, the Skipper made me raise my arms so that he could tie them to the boom.&nbsp; Having done that, he stood before me eyeing my breasts.&nbsp; I was thankful at least that he didn&#8217;t feel them.

He disappeared below to get a whip.&nbsp; April stood off to the side watching me gravely.&nbsp; James, at the helm, seemed more interested in April&#8217;s reaction to the unfolding events than in me.&nbsp; Meanwhile, Ivy circumambulated me, eyeing my front, smirking.&nbsp; She made me feel thoroughly humiliated.

The Skipper returned with a multi-tailed leather lash.&nbsp; Each thong had several knots in it.&nbsp; Was this the dreaded cat-o&#8217;-nine-tails? 

There I was, half naked, arms bound over head, waiting to be whipped.&nbsp; The Skipper stood off to my left side.&nbsp; Ivy was somewhat in front of me, still smirking.

�Are you ready for your whipping,� the Skipper asked, feeling my back and sides.

�Please no,� I begged.

The Skipper ignored my plea.&nbsp; He drew back the whip swung it into me.&nbsp; Shlackk!&nbsp; Across the back.&nbsp; I gasped.&nbsp; It really hurt.&nbsp; Again, shlackk!&nbsp; �Ow!&nbsp; Oh my god!�&nbsp; ...Shlackk!&nbsp; �Ohh!&nbsp; Please not so hard.�

�You&#8217;re not counting the strokes, Jenny.&nbsp; We&#8217;ll have to start over.�

�No, please.&nbsp; You hadn&#8217;t told me to count.&nbsp; But that was three.&nbsp; I&#8217;ve had three.�

Shlackk!&nbsp; �OW!&nbsp; ...Four.&nbsp; God that hurts.�

�No, that was one.&nbsp; I said we were starting over again.&nbsp; Shall we start over yet again?�

�Oh god no, please!&nbsp; You&#8217;ve hit me four times already.&nbsp; It hurts so much.�

Shlackk!&nbsp; �AHHH!&nbsp; Five.�
�That&#8217;s not five.&nbsp; That&#8217;s not anything.&nbsp; I&#8217;m just going to keep whipping you until you start counting correctly.�

�One then!&nbsp; Is that what it&#8217;s supposed to be?&nbsp; Please don&#8217;t keep whipping me.�

�That&#8217;s better.&nbsp; One it is.&nbsp; I knew you would catch on.&nbsp; Now after this, add &#8216;sir&#8217; to your count.�

Shlackk!&nbsp; �Ow! Ow!&nbsp; ...Two, sir.&nbsp; Is that what you want?&nbsp; I&#8217;m trying to do it right.�

�Yes.&nbsp; You&#8217;re doing it just right now.&nbsp; Two down, ten to go.�

SShlackk!&nbsp; �AHHHH!&nbsp; Three, sir.&nbsp; Oh-my-god, don&#8217;t hit me that hard.�

He laid on three more strokes, progressively harder, with me crying out after each one.&nbsp; Then he paused, and examined my back, passing his hand over the welts.&nbsp; �Hmm.&nbsp; Better move it around more or I might break the skin.&nbsp; We won&#8217;t want that now would we?�

�No sir.&nbsp; Please sir, you&#8217;re hurting me so much.�

Now, instead of being on my left, he stood directly behind me.&nbsp; SShlackk!&nbsp;&nbsp; �AHHH!&nbsp; Oh-my-god, no.�&nbsp; He laid that one onto my right side; it wrapped around the ribs to the front, just below the breasts.

�What was that?�

�Seven, sir.&nbsp; Please not on the front.�

But as I turned away to keep him on my left side so as to prevent the whip from wrapping around to my front, he switched to a backhand stroke that caught me directly across the stomach.&nbsp; �OW, OW, OW!&nbsp; ...Eight, sir.&nbsp; Oh, please...�

As I twisted in the other direction to avoid another backhand stroke on the front, he laid on a forehand stroke that caught the base of my right breast.&nbsp; �OOOOH!&nbsp; No, please no!�&nbsp; The sting was vicious.&nbsp; Couldn&#8217;t he stay away from my breasts?

�Mmm.&nbsp; Those pretty little titties.�&nbsp; He paused to fondle my breasts.&nbsp; �How did that one feel?&nbsp; Pretty good, eh?&nbsp; You gotta like that high intensity.�

�Please not there.&nbsp; Anywhere else.�&nbsp; If he hit me on the nipples with that awful thing, I thought I would just die.

�What number are we on now, Jenny?&nbsp; Do you know?�

I wasn&#8217;t sure.&nbsp; Somehow it had to be near the end.&nbsp; �Is it ten or eleven, sir?&nbsp; I think it&#8217;s eleven, sir.�&nbsp; Actually I thought it was probably ten.

�No.&nbsp; That was nine.&nbsp; Three more to go.&nbsp; You&#8217;re a good girl, Jenny.&nbsp; Are you ready?�

This time I kept my back to him, not knowing whether he would use a backhand or forehand stroke.

SShlackk!&nbsp; �AHHH!�&nbsp; It was a backhand stroke that wrapped around enough to catch the side of my left breast.&nbsp; I writhed, gasping.&nbsp; Finally I said, �Ten, sir.�

SShlackk!&nbsp; The hard forehand stroke wrapped around straight onto my right breast, the knotted thongs hitting my nipple like bullets.&nbsp; �EEEEEE!� I let out a shrill scream.&nbsp; My knees gave out from under me, and I hung from my bound wrists.&nbsp; As the pain crested, I thought I was going to faint.&nbsp; 

He paused to feel my breast.&nbsp; After a time I murmured, �Eleven, sir.�&nbsp; The end was finally near.

�Where should we lay the last one?&nbsp; We want to finish strongly, don&#8217;t we?&nbsp; You&#8217;re such a good girl under the whip, we want to make this memorable.�

�Oh, please no.&nbsp; You&#8217;ve already whipped me so hard.�

�Now what if I were to quit now, without giving you your last stroke.&nbsp; That would be disappointing, wouldn&#8217;t it.&nbsp; You would be left with a real sense of incompleteness.�

I shook my head.&nbsp; I would not be left with any sense of incompleteness if he stopped now.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t need whippings to feel complete.

Continuing to feel up my breasts, he said, �But take a look at your tits.&nbsp; No harm done.&nbsp; Just some nice pretty welts.&nbsp; And those ones leading across your nipple are so cute.&nbsp; So you want me to finish with an extra-hard one right on the tits.&nbsp; Your nipples are sticking out just begging for it, aren&#8217;t they?� 

�Please no.&nbsp; Not there.&nbsp; You don&#8217;t know how that feels.�

He started prodding and pinching my nipples.&nbsp; They were stiff and hard... but my right nipple hurt so bad.

�You&#8217;re hurting me.&nbsp; Please leave my breasts alone.�

�Tits!&nbsp; Your perky tits need a hard whipping.�&nbsp; He was kneading them vigorously.

�Ow.&nbsp; Ow.&nbsp; Please don&#8217;t torment me like this.&nbsp; Just finish your whipping and let me be.�

�Then stand like so.&nbsp; That&#8217;s good.&nbsp; Arch your back, thrust those titties out.&nbsp; You know you deserve this and you really want it.�

He took a step back to my right.&nbsp; I turned my head away from him and squinched my eyes shut, waiting ...waiting ...waiting.

SShlackk!&nbsp; �EEEEEEEEE...&nbsp; Ow, ow, ow...�&nbsp; Again my knees gave out and I hung from my wrists.&nbsp; Gasping, panting.&nbsp; My nipples were on fire.&nbsp; He had hit me so hard.&nbsp; I was in agony, just writhing with pain.

But my punishment was finally done.&nbsp; As I began to regain my equilibrium, I looked down at my breasts.&nbsp; My nipples appeared to be intact, although I wouldn&#8217;t have known that from how they felt.&nbsp; �Twelve, sir,� I gasped.

�Now you want to thank me for whipping you so well, don&#8217;t you?�

�Yes, sir.&nbsp; Thank you, sir.�&nbsp; I&#8217;d say anything not be whipped again.

�And what are you thanking me for?�

Insubordination was out of the question.&nbsp; �Thank you for whipping me so well, sir.�

�You are a very good girl, Jenny.&nbsp; A very good girl.�&nbsp; He untied my wrists from the boom.&nbsp; I dropped to my knees, cradling my stinging breasts.

********

That evening in the twilight, I was alone with Rafiq as he took his turn watching the helm.&nbsp; He was applying a soothing balm to my whip marks, as I sat on the deck half naked before him.&nbsp; Although he was sympathetic, he was not incensed that the Skipper had punished me so severely.

�How can you condone what that bastard did to me?� I demanded.

�I&#8217;m not condoning it.&nbsp; But what&#8217;s the point of condemning it?&nbsp; What&#8217;s done is done.&nbsp; You got a whipping.&nbsp; I appreciate that it was hard for you.&nbsp; It would be hard for anybody.&nbsp; But what good does it do for either of us to moan about it now?&nbsp; And you&#8217;re still as beautiful and spirited as you ever were.&nbsp; Even more beautiful.�

�Covered with whip marks?&nbsp; Do you call that pretty?�

�Well.&nbsp; Isn&#8217;t the answer obvious?�

�Oh, you!&nbsp; What next?&nbsp; That my whipping is erotically stimulating?�

�Well, isn&#8217;t it.&nbsp; Aren&#8217;t you aroused now?&nbsp; Look how hard your nipples are,� he said, fondling them.

�But that&#8217;s because they&#8217;re sore and you keep twiddling them as you put that liniment on me.�

�No, they were already really stiff.�

�Well, because I can still feel residual sting.&nbsp; And besides, I&#8217;m chilly.&nbsp; You&#8217;ve got a shirt on.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t.�

�Yes.&nbsp; I&#8217;m aware of your nakedness.�&nbsp; He gave me a sly grin.&nbsp; �There&#8217;s something very special when a girl has to be naked, while guys wear clothes.�

�Has to be naked?&nbsp; What do you mean by that?&nbsp; ...Oh, that&#8217;s your fantasy, is that right?&nbsp; Like I&#8217;m your little slave girl, bare breasted before you, and just got a whipping.�

�Yeah.&nbsp; It sounds good, doesn&#8217;t it?�

�Maybe to you.�

�And also to you.&nbsp; Right?�

�You&#8217;re a really annoying person.&nbsp; Do you know that?�&nbsp; But as I spoke, I was beaming at him.

He cuddled me close to keep me warm.&nbsp; We sat in silence.&nbsp; After a time I said, �I don&#8217;t want to keep bringing up a painful subject, but it bothers me that you think I would get erotic pleasure from being whipped so hard.&nbsp; There was nothing erotic there.&nbsp; It really, really hurt.�

�Well, maybe it just needs an adjustment of perspectives about pleasure and pain.�

�I&#8217;m sorry, Rafiq, but you&#8217;re wrong.&nbsp; It&#8217;s not a matter of changing perspectives.&nbsp; I know what kinky discipline is, and that wasn&#8217;t it.�

�You know about such things?&nbsp; That&#8217;s interesting.&nbsp; What sort of experiences have you had?�

Oh-my-god.&nbsp; I was mortified by the awful thing I had just revealed.&nbsp; As I&#8217;ve described in some previous stories, I have received certain untoward punishments that culminated in sexual release.&nbsp; But it wasn&#8217;t something I ever wanted to happen.&nbsp; I&#8217;m not a &#8216;pain slut&#8217;.&nbsp; I hate that ugly term.

�Oh, Rafiq,� I stammered.&nbsp; �I don&#8217;t know why I said that. ...This is so embarrassing.&nbsp; You&#8217;re getting a completely wrong idea about me.&nbsp; I never sought out that kind of thing.&nbsp; That&#8217;s not what I&#8217;m about.�

Rafiq squeezed me close.&nbsp; �I didn&#8217;t mean to sound like I was probing off-limits.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t want to talk about anything that makes you uncomfortable.�

Now I realized that I was behaving as if I wasn&#8217;t worthy of his intimacy.&nbsp; After a time I said, �I&#8217;m sorry.&nbsp; I guess I&#8217;m overreacting.&nbsp; Of course we&#8217;ll talk all about it.&nbsp; I wouldn&#8217;t want to have secrets from you.&nbsp; But let&#8217;s not go into it tonight.&nbsp; I feel so drained by what happened today.�

�I understand that.&nbsp; By the way, it&#8217;s not that easy for me to reveal how much pleasure I get from your...&nbsp; your being a damsel in distress.&nbsp; It&#8217;s a strange thing.&nbsp; Not consistent with the rest of me.�

�Oh...&nbsp; Yeah.&nbsp; Funny how guys and girls are made.�

After a pause Rafiq whispered, �Everything is just as it should be tonight.&nbsp; And tomorrow I do intend to have some words with the Skipper on your behalf.�

I smiled at him gratefully.&nbsp; He gave me a long kiss.&nbsp; As the splendor of the cosmos was revealed in the blackening sky, I fell asleep in his arms.

*********

The next morning, on meeting the Skipper as I emerged on deck I said, �Good morning, sir.�&nbsp; The ease with which I greeted him surprised me.&nbsp; Strangely, I didn&#8217;t bear as much resentment as I thought I should.

�Good morning, Jenny.&nbsp; You&#8217;re looking well.&nbsp; Life at sea seems to agree with you,� he replied, smiling.

�Yes, sir.�&nbsp; I was a bit shocked to hear myself addressing him as sir.&nbsp; Nobody else affords the Skipper that respect.&nbsp; I was glad that nobody else overheard me.&nbsp; I&#8217;m not sure what they would have thought.

Still, I noted that where I had previously seen only loathsome decadence, I could now see some other dimensions.&nbsp; There was a bit of a commanding aspect to him.&nbsp; Even so, I kept my distance.&nbsp; I didn&#8217;t trust him.

Other facets of the my social situation aboard the yacht were also problematic.&nbsp; Because she considered me to have stolen Rafiq from her, Ivy would not speak to me.&nbsp; I could feel her animosity, and was a little frightened of it.

April also was decidedly cool toward me, perhaps because she was Ivy&#8217;s cousin.&nbsp; Twice during conversations with her, she had blamed me for the breakup.&nbsp; She said she had never imagined me the kind of person who would do that.&nbsp; This hurt, because she was a friend.&nbsp; After all, she had invited me here and was the only person I had known previously.

The absence of a female friend on board was a privation.&nbsp; I rely so much on females for sympathy, understanding, and advice.&nbsp; But now I was dependent on Rafiq for all my social needs.

That did not seem to bother Rafiq, however.&nbsp; He maintained a polite distance from everyone but me ...and more than a polite distance from Ivy.&nbsp; In fact, Ivy was no longer speaking to him.

I felt that I was guilty of causing their falling out.&nbsp; Rafiq, on the other hand, although he felt sorry that Ivy was taking it so badly, seemed to think it was fated, saying �to resist falling for you would have been like trying to stop breathing.�

That was wondrously captivating to hear that from a guy you admire so much.&nbsp; Nevertheless, having always been a little shy, and feeling my allure to be understated compared to Ivy&#8217;s, it didn&#8217;t quite fit my self-image for Rafiq to dump the beautiful, poised, and vivacious Ivy in favor of me.&nbsp; But I certainly couldn&#8217;t complain about it.

Anyway, a little later I noticed Rafiq conversing quietly with the Skipper.&nbsp; I suspected he was talking about me, and kept out of earshot.&nbsp; After five or ten minutes, Rafiq approached me.&nbsp; �Heyyyy, Jenny.&nbsp; I spoke to him about yesterday&#8217;s whipping being excessive.&nbsp; To some degree he was sympathetic.&nbsp; And he even agreed not to use the cat on you again.&nbsp; Um...&nbsp; That&#8217;s the good news.�

Yes?&nbsp; And...�&nbsp; I waited for Rafiq to continue.

�Well, now for the other news.�&nbsp; Rafiq had this furtive smile.&nbsp; �He&#8217;s probably going to whip you with something else instead.�

My mouth fell open.&nbsp; �Why?&nbsp; Now what have I done wrong?�

�Oh...&nbsp; Probably nothing.&nbsp; I think he just feels that you&#8217;re good for another whipping.&nbsp; But not right now.&nbsp; So relax.�












Chapter 2: Storm and Clearing

In the afternoon I took a long nap below with Rafiq.&nbsp; I was trying to get myself more on his schedule. He seemed naturally to be a night person.

The schedule for watching the helm was 0500 to 1200, morning shift, Skipper sometimes spelled by Ivy, who knew at lot; 1200-2100, afternoon and evening, James, again sometimes spelled by Ivy, and with April increasing being entrusted for some periods of time; and 2100-0500, the night shift, Rafiq.&nbsp; Nobody thought I was qualified to be responsible for the boat by myself.&nbsp; ...By the way, it was the Skipper who insisted we tell time on the 24-hour rather than the 12-hour scale.

When I awoke, I had the feeling that something was afoot on deck.&nbsp; I left Rafiq asleep, and as I emerged above, I was shocked to see April, stripped completely naked, bound hands over head, a cloth gag across her mouth, and James, wielding a whip on her.

It was not the cat-o&#8217;-nine-tails used on me.&nbsp; It was a short single thong whip, very flexible, probably of some synthetic material.&nbsp; From the speed with which he flicked it on her, I sensed that it was lightweight.

James was going after April&#8217;s butt.&nbsp; The whip left only faint pink marks, and from April reactions I didn&#8217;t get the sense that it was unbearably painful.&nbsp; 

Nevertheless, she was really upset, yelling muffled through her gag.&nbsp; I know April, and I knew that she had no previous experience with corporal punishment.&nbsp; I felt torn.&nbsp; I didn&#8217;t know whether I should try to intercede on her behalf.

Ivy was watching, agitated.&nbsp; Her wrists were bound before her with leather handcuffs.&nbsp; The Skipper standing next to her, seeming to monitor Ivy&#8217;s reaction as much as he was watching April&#8217;s whipping.

I felt certain that the Skipper and James were not going to tolerate any interference from me.&nbsp; Trying to do anything would probably just land me another whipping, and I really didn&#8217;t want that.&nbsp; Especially not now, since yesterday&#8217;s whip marks were still visible, even though the welts had receded.&nbsp; My nipples were still sensitive.

So I just watched, feeling helpless.&nbsp; James had switched to the front of her thighs, lashing her over and over again.&nbsp; April was twisting and turning, trying to avoid the strokes.&nbsp; I knew he was trying to get her between the legs, but she kept them together to protect herself.

�Now I want to see you dance,� said James, standing before her.&nbsp; �Come on, shake it.�

April shook her head.&nbsp; James lashed her twice across the stomach, then across the ribs.&nbsp; I wondered if he would whip her breasts.&nbsp; Her big jugs looked like a tempting target.

April protested as loudly as she could through her gag, but James was insistent, �Dance.&nbsp; Dance.&nbsp;&nbsp; Shake it!�

After the another whip stroke landed just below her breasts, she acquiesced and began rocking her hips rhythmically.&nbsp; James let up with the whip for a moment, then started giving her light strokes on her hips in rhythm with her dance.

April continued to dance.&nbsp; She wasn&#8217;t putting a whole lot into it; she kept her legs together, and her jugs swayed only a little.&nbsp;&nbsp; But for now James seemed reasonably satisfied.&nbsp; He started to feel up her ass while she rocked her hips.

April didn&#8217;t seem too distressed at this point, but she certainly didn&#8217;t look happy about it either.&nbsp; Although I certainly didn&#8217;t want to trade places with her, I did sort of wonder how I would do in her situation.&nbsp; Coerced with a whip into performing naked.&nbsp; All eyes on your body.

Giving her a couple hard slaps on the butt, James said, �Come on, put your body into it.&nbsp; Shake that booty!�

Moving her legs apart, April started putting more into it.&nbsp; Her jugs started swaying back and forth.

Taking hold of her nipples and jiggling her breasts, James said, �Come on.&nbsp; Shake those big boobs.&nbsp; I want to see them flop.�

April waggled her big jugs back and forth in wide flopping sweeps.&nbsp; I wondered how she felt about being made to do that.&nbsp; I wondered how I would do in that situation.&nbsp; And I wondered if how much I can shake my breasts would have much allure.

Dangling the whip before her, James never took his eyes of her.&nbsp; Then he flicked it lightly at her breasts a few times.&nbsp; Voicing muffled complaints through her gag, April recoiled away from the strokes while continuing her gyrations.

As she rocked her hips, James then slid his hand along the inside of her thigh and into her crotch.&nbsp; April tightened her legs together, trimming her undulations and finally stopping altogether.&nbsp; Through her gag I thought she said, �Let me go.�

Left hand at her pussy, James scored the whip onto her hip, wrapping around onto her rear.&nbsp; April continued her muffled complaints.

As he continued to harass her, she lifted her leg, set a foot to his stomach and gave him a kick that sent him stumbling backward.&nbsp; He fell against the bulkhead.

Although he got up slowly, rubbing the back of his head where he hit it, he seemed to take it in good humor.&nbsp; He was smiling, and muttering something about how much he liked strong women.&nbsp; But he stopped going after her pussy.

Instead, he started whipping her breasts.&nbsp; April was twisting and lurching trying to dodge the strokes, all the while crying out incoherently through her gag.&nbsp; Now her big jugs were really bouncing.&nbsp; She tried to kick at him, but James stayed out of range of her feet as he laid on stroke after stroke.&nbsp; Her breasts were getting flushed.

Finally, April ceased her struggles and muffled yells, and just stood there sobbing as James continued lashing her breasts.&nbsp; This was just unbearable; I was going to have to try to intercede.

Just as I was about to step forward, James laid off.&nbsp; He dropped the whip and gave her a hug, with consoling words.&nbsp; Perhaps April&#8217;s sobbing acquiescence was not the kind of response that aroused him to further whip her.

When he ungagged her and released her wrists, she turned away from him, and with Ivy immediately retreated below to our compartment.&nbsp; I followed them down to console her.&nbsp; But they had locked the door and wouldn&#8217;t let me in.

I was afraid to return to the deck and be alone the Skipper and James.&nbsp; I thought they might whip me next.&nbsp; I stayed below in the galley and made dinner.&nbsp; All the while I felt bad for April.&nbsp; And I felt bad for myself that she wouldn&#8217;t even allow me in to offer comfort.

I must have been really on edge, because when the Skipper suddenly appeared in the galley doorway, I let out a startled yelp.
 
I quickly apologized.&nbsp; �Sorry.&nbsp; I was just startled.�

�No problem.&nbsp; Just came down for some rum.&nbsp; You doing all right?&nbsp; Need any help?�

�No, sir.&nbsp; Things will be ready in fifteen or twenty minutes.�

�Good.&nbsp; You&#8217;re the best damned cook.&nbsp; Yeah.&nbsp; Best damn cook I ever had aboard.�

That was blatant nonsense.&nbsp; My cooking was elementary, especially compared to Ivy&#8217;s, which had been surprisingly elegant.&nbsp; At that time I hadn&#8217;t had much experience at it.&nbsp; But it seemed that the Skipper was using praise to reassure me of his benign intentions.

After rummaging around the galley for a couple minutes, then pouring himself some rum and taking several gulps, he spoke, in a manner sort of to himself, but with the obvious intention that I should hear, �That James...&nbsp; I don&#8217;t know about that boy.&nbsp; Doesn&#8217;t seem to have good judgment.&nbsp; Tried to warn him about whipping April.&nbsp; I guess I didn&#8217;t make myself clear.�

Then turning and looking straight at me, he said, �Jenny, you know, there&#8217;s a certain kind of girl you can whip.&nbsp; And a certain kind of girl you can&#8217;t.&nbsp; You gotta be able to recognize the difference.&nbsp; The right kind of girl, when you whip her, she&#8217;ll be the best damn girl ever.&nbsp; Yeah, the best damn girl ever.&nbsp; But you gotta know the right time to whip her.&nbsp; And you gotta do it the right way.�

With that he turned and scuffed out of the galley.&nbsp; I just stood there, dazed.&nbsp; The right kind of girl to whip?&nbsp; Was he referring to me?

********

The next morning April treated James with an icy reserve, despite his repeated advances.&nbsp;&nbsp; Meanwhile, I was feeling that I needed to talk with another woman about what the Skipper had said to me.&nbsp; I wanted to talk to April.&nbsp; But not with Ivy there.&nbsp; Ivy hated me.&nbsp; And today Ivy never left April&#8217;s side.

This question, about whether there was some right kind of girl to whip, is not something I wanted to bring up with Rafiq.&nbsp; I was pretty sure I wasn&#8217;t going to like what he had to say.&nbsp; I had a feeling that he wouldn&#8217;t be that sympathetic.

Indeed, it seemed more likely that he would just encourage me to enjoy getting whipped.&nbsp; Last night I had told him of my past experiences with corporal punishment (as related in other stories on this website).&nbsp; Although he had tried to convey sympathy, he was plainly aroused by the erotic overtones.

In any case, I was feeling isolated.&nbsp; And vulnerable.&nbsp; Otherwise the day was relatively uneventful... until early evening just before dinner.

I was down in the girls compartment.&nbsp; I kept my clothes in there but I didn&#8217;t sleep there any more with April and Ivy.&nbsp; Instead I liked sharing Rafiq&#8217;s berth, although it was a tight squeeze and in his sleep he sometimes mashed me against the wall. 

At this time I was sorting through my clothes.&nbsp; Ivy came in.&nbsp; I had grown accustomed to maintaining silence with her.&nbsp; 

But after couple minutes, she confronted me, saying, �Hey, slut bitch.&nbsp; See this safety pin?&nbsp; I think I&#8217;m gonna stick it through your clit.�

I wasn&#8217;t much afraid that Ivy could actually do that.&nbsp; But I was concerned that she might try to scratch me with the open safety pin.&nbsp; I tried to mollify her.

�Oh, Ivy.&nbsp; I&#8217;ve told you how sorry I am about what happened between you and Rafiq.&nbsp; I would never have been so friendly with him in the first place if I had known that it would cause you two to break up.�&nbsp; Actually, I don&#8217;t know whether that last statement was true.&nbsp; At this point, I really wanted and needed Rafiq as my own.&nbsp; How could I have foregone him?

I continued, �And I&#8217;m not a slut either.&nbsp; I&#8217;ve barely even gone to bed with Rafiq&nbsp; ...I mean, like technically.�&nbsp; 

And that was sort of true, a result of the lack of privacy.&nbsp; When we were about to do it once on deck in the middle of the night, the Skipper came out and partook of his strange night-time habit of pissing over the bulkhead.&nbsp; We did it once under the covers in Rafiq&#8217;s berth, but since the guys&#8217; bedroom also serves as everyone&#8217;s living room, the distraction of wondering if somebody was about to walk in on us made it less than ideal, at least for me.&nbsp; Finally, the girls&#8217; compartment doesn&#8217;t work for me because it&#8217;s imbued with Ivy&#8217;s vibes.

�You are a slut, you rotten bitch.&nbsp; You fuck for every guy you see.&nbsp; That&#8217;s why I&#8217;m going to try to slow you down by safety pinning your clit.�&nbsp; She waved the pin toward my crotch.

�Get away from me with that thing.&nbsp; ...And I don&#8217;t fuck for every guy I see.&nbsp; I&#8217;ll bet you&#8217;ve gone to bed with a lot more guys than I have.&nbsp; A whole lot more.�

I was sure she had to be more experienced than me.&nbsp; I had sexual relations with only one guy before this, Mick (who I&#8217;ve mentioned in three previous stories).&nbsp;&nbsp; ...Well, there was a sort of encounter with one guy before Mick, but that was a mistake, and a bummer, so I don&#8217;t count that.&nbsp; ...In any case, I&#8217;m pretty cautious compared to a lot of girls I know.

Ivy continued closing in on me, threatening with that safety pin.&nbsp; I retreated and fell back onto April&#8217;s berth, raising my legs to defend myself.&nbsp; Ivy thrust her pin at me.&nbsp; I let out a shriek when she scratched my calf.&nbsp; I gave her a hard kick in the stomach.&nbsp; Ivy cried out, but pressed forward again.&nbsp; Spontaneously screeching the whole time, I continued kicking at her.

At that moment the Skipper burst through the door, followed by Rafiq and James.&nbsp; Instantly they separated us.

�Brawling!� the Skipper bellowed.&nbsp; His face was red with anger.&nbsp; �I won&#8217;t tolerate brawling among my crew.&nbsp; Up on deck immediately.&nbsp; A whipping for both of you.�

Whatever punishment I received would be worth it if Ivy got the same.&nbsp; Yet I wondered how she would take it compared to me.&nbsp; Would she retain her composure?&nbsp; Would I end up begging and weeping?

When we got out on deck, the Skipper ordered, �Strip off your tops, both of you.�&nbsp; After a few moments of hesitation I took off my tank top; Ivy took off her bikini top.&nbsp; We stood side by side, bare breasted, facing the guys.

The Skipper took out a nasty looking slender tawse-like black strap, and a long, thin cane.&nbsp; After eyeing us for several moments, the Skipper continued,&nbsp; �Now the rest.&nbsp; Take it down.�

Out of the corner of my eye, I watched Ivy to see if she was going to strip completely, which is what I thought the Skipper had told us to do, although I wasn&#8217;t quite sure.&nbsp; She didn&#8217;t move.&nbsp; I wasn&#8217;t going to strip if she didn&#8217;t.

�Do you understand?� asked the Skipper.&nbsp; �Ivy, off with your bikini bottom.&nbsp; Jenny, off with your shorts and whatever you have underneath.&nbsp; Any more delay and I&#8217;ll whip your breasts.�

That was unequivocal.&nbsp; Without hesitation, I took down my shorts and undies.&nbsp; Then both of us stood naked while the guys looked us over.&nbsp; Now I wished that we hadn&#8217;t shaved ourselves that second night on the boat.&nbsp; It just made me feel that much more exposed.

James had his eyes on Ivy.&nbsp; The Skipper mostly studied my body.&nbsp; Rafiq&#8217;s gaze shifted back and forth between Ivy and me.&nbsp; I felt he was comparing my body with hers, and I didn&#8217;t like that one bit.

The Skipper said, �Well, Jenny, I see that the other day&#8217;s whip marks from the cat on your tits have disappeared.�

�Please sir, don&#8217;t whip me there now.�

�Where don&#8217;t you want me to whip you?�

�Not on the breasts, sir, please.�&nbsp; I knew he just wanted to hear me say &#8216;tits&#8217; or &#8216;breasts&#8217;.&nbsp; I didn&#8217;t care what he made me say.&nbsp; I just didn&#8217;t want that wicked looking cane slicing onto my girl flesh.

�We&#8217;ll see what happens this afternoon, Jenny.&nbsp; But for now you are to turn around and get down on all fours.&nbsp; ...You too, Ivy.�

We turned around and got down on our hand and knees.

�Elbows down on the deck.&nbsp; Bottom up,� continued the Skipper.&nbsp; �Arch your back, Ivy.&nbsp; Get that butt up there like you really want to receive the punishment you deserve.&nbsp; That&#8217;s better.&nbsp; ...Knees further apart, Jenny.&nbsp; This is no time for modesty.&nbsp; ...That&#8217;s good.&nbsp; A nice stable position.�

So there we were, weight resting on forearms and knees, butts elevated, waiting for a whipping.&nbsp; With knees well apart I knew we must be putting on an interesting show.&nbsp; I wondered if my labia were staying closed, minimizing what they could see.&nbsp; But I knew that was the least of my worries now.

Out of the corner of my eye I could see the Skipper preparing to swat Ivy with the strap.&nbsp; After eyeing her for several moments, he swung it into her.&nbsp; Whap!&nbsp; Ivy gasped.&nbsp; Her hand went back, rubbing her rear.

After a moment, the Skipper said, �Enough of that.&nbsp; Get that hand back where it belongs.&nbsp; There&#8217;s more to come.�

Ivy resumed her position.&nbsp; ...Whap!&nbsp; She winced, but maintained her position.&nbsp; ...Whap!&nbsp; �Ah!�&nbsp;&nbsp; ...Whap!&nbsp; �Ow!�&nbsp;&nbsp; ...Whap!&nbsp; �Ow!&nbsp; Shit.&nbsp; Be careful where you&#8217;re hitting.�&nbsp;&nbsp; ...Whap!&nbsp; �Ow!&nbsp; Fuck.&nbsp; Not there.&nbsp; Oooh...�&nbsp; Ivy brought her hand back and crumpled low, gasping.&nbsp; He must have hit her on the pussy.&nbsp; We were so vulnerable in this position.&nbsp; There were tears in her eyes, but she was trying not to cry.

�Now Jenny, it&#8217;s your turn,� said the Skipper.

I grimaced, waiting.&nbsp; ...Whap!&nbsp; I inhaled sharply, but suppressed vocalization.&nbsp; I didn&#8217;t want to come across as being weaker than Ivy.&nbsp; ...Whap!&nbsp; I was gasping and panting, suppressing the impulse to bring my hand back to protect my butt.&nbsp;&nbsp; ...Whap!&nbsp; My butt was burning. ...Whap!&nbsp; �Ooh!�&nbsp; That one was on the backs of the thighs.&nbsp;&nbsp; ...Whap!&nbsp; �Ahhh!&nbsp; Owww...�&nbsp; The end of the strap had caught my pussy.&nbsp; I brought my hand back momentarily.

�Back into position,�ordered the Skipper.&nbsp; �There&#8217;s one more to come.�

Whap!&nbsp; �Ahhhhh!&nbsp; Ow-ow-ow...�&nbsp; Right smack on the pussy, really hard.&nbsp; The intensity was electric.&nbsp; Like Ivy, I folded low to the deck gasping, but trying to suppress the sobs that wanted to issue forth.
 
�Bravely taken, both of you.&nbsp; Good girls.&nbsp; I&#8217;ll give you a few minutes respite before your caning.�

Whipping on the genitals seemed so unjust.&nbsp; And I couldn&#8217;t believe there was more to come now.&nbsp; I remained curled up, prostrate, gently rubbing my burning labia, just trying not to give way to tears.

My head was turned away from Ivy, and I had no thought of her.&nbsp; But I later learned that her feeling of despair matched my own at this point.

After a while the Skipper said, �Now we&#8217;ll have you stand up.&nbsp; Since you two wanted to have at each other, perhaps it&#8217;s appropriate to have each of you administer the cane to the other.�

I glanced over at Ivy.&nbsp; She was getting up.&nbsp; She glanced over at me with a look of revulsion.&nbsp; I got up quickly.

Skipper said, �All right Ivy, bend over and hold the bulkhead.&nbsp; Jenny will give you a caning.�

Ivy hesitated, looking at me angrily.&nbsp; �I won&#8217;t have her cane me.&nbsp; Absolutely not.�

�Yes, Jenny&#8217;s going to cane you.&nbsp; Absolutely.�

I spoke up, �I don&#8217;t want to cane her.�

Skipper gave me a withering look as he handed me the cane.&nbsp; �You will obey orders.�&nbsp; Then turning to the James and Rafiq, he said, �Bind Ivy&#8217;s wrists to the boom.&nbsp; ...Arms apart, crux style.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t want her twisting and turning, trying to avoid Jenny&#8217;s strokes.�

They tied a rope around each wrist, then secured the opposite ends far apart on the boom.&nbsp; Ivy&#8217;s arms were drawn apart, raised about thirty degrees from horizontal.&nbsp; Looking at her in that position, her body was awesome.

I glanced at Rafiq.&nbsp; His eyes were glued to Ivy.&nbsp; I felt a wave of jealousy.&nbsp; But I tried to convince myself that I was still the one he loved.&nbsp; ...That even though Ivy and I were both equally naked, it was only the magnetic quality of a bound woman that drew his eyes.

�Twelve strokes with the cane, vigorous applied.&nbsp; Proceed, Jenny,� ordered the Skipper.

I positioned myself to apply cane strokes to Ivy&#8217;s rear.&nbsp; I wasn&#8217;t sure I could go through with this.&nbsp; I hesitated.&nbsp;&nbsp; ...Finally I said, �I can&#8217;t do this.&nbsp; It isn&#8217;t right.�

The Skipper grabbed his strap and came at me.&nbsp; He cocked his arm; looking right at my breasts.&nbsp; I dropped the cane drew my arms across my chest.&nbsp; Whap!&nbsp; Whap!&nbsp; Whap!&nbsp; Protecting my breasts, my arms took the force of the strokes.

He had backed me against the bulkhead.&nbsp; Whap!&nbsp; �Ow!�&nbsp; He had landed that on the front of my thighs.&nbsp; I raised and turned in one knee to try to protect my privates.&nbsp; Whap!&nbsp; Whap!

�You self-righteous little goody-goody!&nbsp; Don&#8217;t tell me what&#8217;s right.&nbsp; You steal Ivy&#8217;s guy, cause her all kinds of grief, and then you have the nerve to tell me that you can&#8217;t obey my rightful order to discipline her for brawling.&nbsp; Now I&#8217;m going to teach you something.�&nbsp; His words stung as much as the strap.

Turning to James and Rafiq, he said, �Hold her arms out against the bulkhead, I&#8217;m going whip her tits and pussy till she learns to obey.�

As James stepped forward to seize my left arm, Rafiq intervened, staying the Skipper&#8217;s hand, �Now wait just a god-damn minute.&nbsp; This is getting out of hand.&nbsp; I&#8217;m not letting you harm Jenny.�

�Harm Jenny?&nbsp; Who said anything about harming Jenny?&nbsp; I&#8217;m disciplining her.&nbsp; Understand?&nbsp; I&#8217;m fed up with the hostility between these two girls.&nbsp; Now they&#8217;re going whip each other until they decide they can live together aboard my ship.&nbsp; Now take hold of her arm.&nbsp; I know what I&#8217;m doing.�

Rafiq glared at the Skipper.&nbsp; The Skipper, drawn to his full height, his jaw set with determination, stared him down.&nbsp; Annunciating each word slowly, the Skipper said, �Jenny needs this.&nbsp; I know how to take care of her.�

Rafiq eyed him for a moment, then looked at me, searching.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t know what Rafiq read from my expression, but whatever it was, he acquiesced and gently took my right arm, which I surrendered to him.&nbsp; They held my arms back against the bulkhead.&nbsp; I was on my knees, facing the Skipper.

Whap!&nbsp; �AHHHH!�&nbsp; He smacked the strap straight onto my left nipple.

Whap!&nbsp; �OHHHHH!&nbsp; Oh god!�&nbsp; Laid into my right nipple, so hard.&nbsp; My breasts were on fire.

�Open your legs wider.�

I obeyed, whimpering, �Please no, please.�

Whap! Right into my pussy.&nbsp; �OOOOH!�&nbsp;&nbsp; ...Then again.&nbsp; Whap!&nbsp;&nbsp; �AHHHHH!&nbsp; ...Please stop!&nbsp; I&#8217;ll do what you say.&nbsp; I&#8217;ll whip Ivy.&nbsp; Just don&#8217;t hit me there any more.�&nbsp; I realized that Ivy was going to get caned one way or another.&nbsp; I was only undergoing this agonizing strapping to prove, to myself as much as anyone else, that I was being forced to administer it.

�That&#8217;s a good girl, Jenny,� said the Skipper.&nbsp; �Now one more to make sure.�

Whap!&nbsp; So hard on the pussy.&nbsp; �OW-OW-OW!&nbsp; ...Oh-my-god.�&nbsp; I felt faint.

As they released my arms, I dropped to the deck, softly crying, nursing my pussy.&nbsp; I didn&#8217;t care what kind of a show I was putting on.

After several minutes I glanced up.&nbsp; The Skipper was watching me patiently, Rafiq sympathetically.&nbsp; April looked distressed.&nbsp; Ivy, bound to the boom, looking over her shoulder at me, revealed nothing in her expression.

Finally I got up.&nbsp; The Skipper handed me the cane.&nbsp; He said to Ivy, �Arch your back.&nbsp; Get your bottom out there nicely.&nbsp; That&#8217;s good.&nbsp; You know you need this caning.�

The cane was thin and surprisingly light.&nbsp; But it was the longest cane I&#8217;d ever seen.&nbsp; I positioned myself and placed the cane on Ivy&#8217;s rear.&nbsp; I hoped I could handle it accurately.

I drew it back.&nbsp; Then swung it into her.&nbsp; It hit her, mid- rear.&nbsp; Ivy didn&#8217;t flinch.

�That&#8217;s not nearly hard enough.&nbsp; Start over.&nbsp; Don&#8217;t you hold back unless you want me to belabor your tits and pussy again.�

�Please no.&nbsp; I&#8217;m trying to do it right, sir.�&nbsp; I gave him the most plaintive expression I could.

The Skipper smiled and muttered something that sounded like �What a gem.�

Again I placed the cane to Ivy&#8217;s rear.&nbsp; Then drew it back.&nbsp; This time I swung hard.&nbsp; Whoosh-thack!&nbsp; Ivy gasped loudly and writhed.&nbsp; I had hit her lower than I intended, across the top of her thighs.&nbsp; She glanced back at me, but the only thing I could read in her expression was pain.

I paused.&nbsp; Then took aim more carefully.&nbsp; Whoosh-thack!&nbsp; Right across the middle of her butt.&nbsp; She gasped again, and panted.

Whoosh-thack!&nbsp;&nbsp; �Ooh!� ...Then again.&nbsp; And again.&nbsp; One hard stroke after another, with the Skipper quietly counting them out.&nbsp; Ivy recoiled with each one.&nbsp; By the ninth stroke Ivy&#8217;s rear was fully marked with horizontal stripes.&nbsp; Her cries were increasingly desperate.&nbsp; I paused and looked at the Skipper.

�Three more to go.�&nbsp; He passed his hand over her rear, feeling the welts.&nbsp; I noticed that his other hand was on her breasts.&nbsp; �You&#8217;re doing very well Ivy.�

He stepped back and nodded to me.&nbsp; I took aim and swung the cane.&nbsp; Whoosh-thack!&nbsp; �OW!&nbsp; Oh god!&nbsp; It hurts.�

There seemed to be no more room on her rear for more strokes.&nbsp; The next I aimed to the back of her thighs.&nbsp; Whoosh-thack!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �OOOOH!�&nbsp;&nbsp; ...And the last.&nbsp; Whoosh-thack!&nbsp; �AHHHHH!�&nbsp; She hung there quietly crying.&nbsp; 

I felt bad for her.&nbsp; I considered apologizing.&nbsp; But I knew I was next, and I thought that anything I could say might be taken as insincere.&nbsp; I expected no mercy from her.

As James and Rafiq released her, the Skipper put a supporting arm around her.&nbsp; �Bravely taken, Ivy.�&nbsp; He held her for several minutes, as Ivy rubbed her rear and regained her composure.

Still holding her, the Skipper turned to Rafiq and James and said, �Bind Jenny to the boom.&nbsp; When Ivy feels ready, she will administer the caning.�

They bound my wrists with ropes and drew my arms apart, binding me in a crux position to the boom.&nbsp; The ropes were pulled hard, my arms about thirty degrees above horizontal.

I hung that way for some time, waiting.&nbsp; The fear of what was to come was mixed with the contentment of having Rafiq&#8217;s eyes on me, not on Ivy.&nbsp; Something in my core was stirred by being bound naked and vulnerable before him.&nbsp; After all, my desire for him, and his for me, lay at the root for why I was now to be whipped.&nbsp; This was powerfully arousing to me.

Ivy finally took up the cane.&nbsp; She slowly circumambulated me, eyeing me cooly all the while.&nbsp; Then she positioned herself, placing the cane to my rear and rubbing it back and forth.&nbsp; She was letting the moments linger.

She drew back the cane.&nbsp; Whoosh-thack!&nbsp; I choked back a cry, gasping with the pain.&nbsp;&nbsp; ...Whoosh-thackk!&nbsp; Searing pain.&nbsp; I was panting loudly.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ...Whoosh-thackkk!&nbsp; �Ow!�&nbsp; That one was across the back of the thighs.&nbsp; I writhed.&nbsp; 

Still I arched my back, presenting my rear to the cane.&nbsp; I was determined to show that I could accept whatever punishment Ivy could inflict.&nbsp; Yet it was pointless to try to hide how much she was hurting me.

Whoosh-thackkk!&nbsp; �OOOH!�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ...Whoosh-thackkkk!&nbsp; �AHHHH!�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

Through the red haze of pain that enveloped me, I heard Rafiq&#8217;s voice, �Ivy&#8217;s hitting way harder than Jenny did.&nbsp; That&#8217;s not right.� 

The Skipper replied, �Ivy&#8217;s got a lot more issues with Jenny than visa versa.&nbsp; You know that.&nbsp; ...Five down, seven to go.�

Ivy swatted me hard four more times, twice on the butt, twice on the back of the thighs.&nbsp; I cried out with each stroke.&nbsp; Then she paused.&nbsp; I hung there gasping and panting, trying to endure the searing pain.

Then she walked slowly around me.&nbsp; I tried to compose myself as best I could.&nbsp; Standing before me, off to my right side, resting the cane on her shoulder, she eyed me.&nbsp; Blinking away the tears, I returned her gaze.&nbsp; The way she was looking at my breasts made me uneasy.

�It&#8217;s so satisfying to inflict pain on you after how you&#8217;ve made me feel during this voyage.&nbsp; What I&#8217;m going to do now...&nbsp; It&#8217;s what I have to do to really satisfy myself.�&nbsp; Then she started to swing the cane into my breasts.&nbsp; 

�Hey!� with a shout, Rafiq leaped forward, catching the main force of the cane with his hand.&nbsp; �What the hell are you doing?�&nbsp; he said, disarming her.

Ivy was pissed, but the Skipper mollified her by saying, �Calm down, Ivy.&nbsp; If you want to put the sting to Jenny&#8217;s titties, I&#8217;ll give you something that will sting &#8217;m good.&nbsp; But not the cane.�

The Skipper went below, and after a minute returned with a thin switch.&nbsp; �This ought to work pretty good.&nbsp; Light enough not to bruise her.&nbsp; See how it works,� he said, offering it to Ivy.

�Let me see that thing,� said Rafiq, intercepting it.&nbsp; He swished it through the air a couple of times, swatted it on to his own calf a couple times, though not very hard, then handed it to Ivy, apparently satisfied that it wouldn&#8217;t harm me.

Ivy frowned, apparently unimpressed with the switch.&nbsp; Like Rafiq she tested it on her calf, but she snapped it hard on herself, flinched, then seemed to brighten at the prospect of using it on me.&nbsp; �How many strokes am I allowed,� she asked.

�Whatever,� the Skipper replied.&nbsp; �I&#8217;ll let you know.&nbsp; There&#8217;ll be parity.�

Ivy held the switch before me, then played it back and forth over my breasts, repeatedly bumping it over my stiff nipples.&nbsp; She said, �What I&#8217;m going to do to your little tits now is what you deserve.&nbsp; So don&#8217;t complain.� 

Ssswitt!&nbsp; She snapped it hard onto my breasts, just above the nipples.&nbsp; �Ooooh!�&nbsp; ...Ssswitt!&nbsp; Ssswitt!&nbsp; Ssswitt!&nbsp; Ssswitt!&nbsp;&nbsp; In rapid succession, below the nipples.&nbsp; ...Ssswitt!&nbsp; Ssswitt!&nbsp; Ssswitt!&nbsp; Ssswitt!&nbsp; Right across the nipples.&nbsp; �Ow-Ow-Ow.&nbsp; Oh fuck, not there, Ivy!�

She paused for a moment to pinch my nipples.&nbsp; �Ouch!&nbsp; Don&#8217;t,� I whimpered.

Then again...&nbsp; Ssswitt!&nbsp; Ssswitt!&nbsp; Ssswitt!&nbsp; Ssswitt!&nbsp; Ssswitt!&nbsp; She was raining the switch down all over my breasts.&nbsp; The sting was beyond description.&nbsp; �AHHHHHH!&nbsp; You&#8217;re going to kill me.�&nbsp;&nbsp; ...Ssswitt!&nbsp; Ssswitt!&nbsp; Ssswitt!&nbsp;&nbsp; �OW-OW-OW!&nbsp; Please no...�&nbsp; My nipples were on fire.&nbsp; I was feeling faint.

I heard Rafiq say �That&#8217;s enough now.�

�Just a few more,� the Skipper said.&nbsp; I was dimly aware that he was holding Rafiq back.

Ssswitt!&nbsp; Ssswitt!&nbsp; Ssswitt!&nbsp; Ssswitt!&nbsp; Ssswitt!&nbsp; Ivy was raining the switch down, hard and fast as she could, straight onto the nipples.&nbsp; �EEEEEEEE!�&nbsp; Things around me darkened.&nbsp; I felt as if I was falling into a different realm of reality.

I next thing I was aware of I was lying on the deck with the Skipper, Rafiq, and April crouching over me.&nbsp; Standing further back was James.&nbsp; Ivy was not to be seen.&nbsp; My breasts hurt like hell.&nbsp; I guess my butt hurt too, but I barely noticed it compared to my breasts.

�Bravely done, Jenny.&nbsp; You are one strong young woman,� said the Skipper.

I was afraid to look at my breasts.&nbsp; Cautiously I brought my hands to them, unsure quite what I would find.&nbsp; Although I could feel the horizontal welts, maybe I was little surprised that everything still seemed to be intact.&nbsp; But my nipples seemed puffier.&nbsp; I glanced down at them.&nbsp; �Am I okay?�

�Oh yes,� replied the Skipper.&nbsp; �You still have a fine-looking pair of titties.&nbsp; Very cute with your whip marks.�

Rafiq scowled at him, �I don&#8217;t agree one bit with what you let Ivy do to her.�

�Well, Ivy wields a mean switch, I must say,� replied the Skipper.&nbsp; �But I said there would be parity.&nbsp; Time for Ivy to see how it feels.�

A moment later, Ivy appeared from below, still naked.&nbsp; �Would a little ice be helpful?� she asked.

Rafiq took the melting ice cube from her and passed it gently over the welts on my breasts.&nbsp; The sensation of cold on my nipples was almost too strong.&nbsp; Yet it did make them feel better.&nbsp; I really liked how all these people, including Ivy, were hovering over me.&nbsp; I just lay there absorbing their solicitude.

After a time, having indicated that I wanted to get up, they assisted me to my feet.&nbsp; The Skipper now said, �Jenny, I want you to administer the switch to Ivy&#8217;s breasts.�

Ivy looked alarmed.&nbsp; I said, �Please, haven&#8217;t both of us been punished enough?�

The Skipper gave me this look that seemed to ask like, hadn&#8217;t I learned anything yet?

I quickly changed my tune, �Yes sir.�&nbsp; I wasn&#8217;t going to take another thrashing right where it would hurt the most just to spare Ivy&#8217;s breasts.&nbsp; Not after what she did to mine.

The Skipper said, �Ivy, on your knees, back against the bulkhead.&nbsp; James, hold one of her arms.&nbsp; I&#8217;ll hold the other.�&nbsp; They held her against the bulkhead.

�Jenny, take the switch and lay it on good and hard across her nipples.&nbsp; I&#8217;ll tell you when to stop.�

I took up the switch.&nbsp; It was lightweight, a couple feet long long, stiff but springy.&nbsp; Placing it against Ivy&#8217;s breasts, I said, �I&#8217;m doing this because I&#8217;ve been ordered to.&nbsp; Not for revenge.&nbsp; But I don&#8217;t mind if you find out what it felt like, what you just did to me.�

Ivy just closed her eyes and turned her head away.&nbsp; I brought back the switch.&nbsp; Then swatted her with it.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t think I hit her hard, but I landed it right across the nipples.&nbsp; �Aaaaghhh!�&nbsp; Ivy choked back further cries, and just panted.

�More, and harder,� ordered the Skipper.&nbsp; �She hit you way harder than that.�

With a flick of the wrist, I swatted her again.&nbsp; Then again and again and again, above the nipples, below the nipples, and right on the nipples.&nbsp; �OW!&nbsp; OW!&nbsp; Fuck!�&nbsp; Her breasts jiggled as she gasped and panted and swore.

I realized that I enjoyed the power of making her struggle with the same kind of anguish she had inflicted on me.&nbsp; I gave her four more rapid strokes across her nipples.&nbsp; 

She let out a prolonged shriek and then her body sagged.&nbsp; From between her legs a stream of pee ran onto the deck.&nbsp; I was alarmed.

They gently set her on the deck, leaning her against the bulkhead.&nbsp; April had disappeared below, probably for some ice.&nbsp; I just stood there paralyzed, as Ivy sat clasping her breasts, crying.

As they tended to Ivy, she regained her composure.&nbsp; The Skipper then said, �Good girl, Ivy.&nbsp;&nbsp; Bravely taken.&nbsp; Now, would you like to whip Jenny some more?�

Ivy turned to him with an expression of shock.&nbsp; She shook her head vigorously negative.

�Lovely.�&nbsp; With an expression of vindication the Skipper turned to Rafiq and said, �You see.&nbsp; We&#8217;ve come to a resolution.�

Rafiq looked at me with a questioning expression, then at Ivy.&nbsp; Seeming to know not what to say, he made a gesture of exasperated acquiescence, and turned away.

The Skipper then pulled out this tubular, long black wooden thing, rounded at both ends, but with intricately carved texture along its length.&nbsp; �I think we&#8217;ll join you two with this.&nbsp; We want to bring you some satisfaction after taking your whippings so well.�

My mouth fell open when I realized that thing was a double-ended dildo and that he intended to make Ivy and me fuck on it together.

Rafiq turned to him, incensed, �Now this has gone far enough.&nbsp; Give me that thing.�&nbsp; He grabbed it from the Skipper.&nbsp; He was about to pitch it overboard, but taking a quick second look at it, he changed his mind and flung it across the deck.&nbsp; It clattered down the steps into the cabin.

Furious, the Skipper turned to him and started shouting.&nbsp; As I stood there stupefied, I felt Ivy pull on my wrist.&nbsp; April was gesturing us to come below.&nbsp; We scrambled down the steps as Rafiq and the Skipper stood bellowing at each other.&nbsp; Ahead of me, just before turning into our compartment, Ivy bent and grabbed something off the floor.&nbsp; It was the double-ended dildo.

We got into our compartment and locked the door.&nbsp; Safe!&nbsp; We turned to each other.&nbsp; Ivy and I spontaneously embraced.&nbsp; Overcome with emotion, I started crying.&nbsp; So did Ivy.&nbsp; April joined in the hug, consoling us.

Several times over I apologized to Ivy for the distress I caused her for breaking up her relationship with Rafiq.&nbsp; Ivy apologized for her hatred of me, and for whipping me so harshly.&nbsp; It was intensely cathartic.&nbsp; And such a euphoria to return to the sisterhood of women.

As we sat on the floor talking, I said to Ivy, �With you and Rafiq I felt like I had a little-sister relationship.&nbsp; I never thought of myself as a contender for Rafiq&#8217;s love.&nbsp; I never suspected he had that kind of interest in me.&nbsp; I thought of you two as a stable couple... even though...�

�Our relationship had problems before you came along.&nbsp; He had started saying that he wanted a more open relationship, where he could see other women.&nbsp; I was really upset about that.&nbsp; I felt I was losing him.�

�But still, if I&#8217;d just thought a little about how it was going to affect you, I could have resisted his advances.&nbsp; But I&#8217;d never been in this situation before.&nbsp; I just wasn&#8217;t thinking.�&nbsp;&nbsp; ...Yet I wondered, even if I had known the pain it would cause, would I have resisted Rafiq&#8217;s advance?

April interrupted, �Men aren&#8217;t worth all this shit.&nbsp; Why don&#8217;t we just kick &#8217;m in the balls?�&nbsp; She laughed in her earthy manner.

�Yeah,� agreed Ivy, giggling.&nbsp; �Let&#8217;s mutiny.&nbsp; Tomorrow morning.&nbsp; We&#8217;ll take over the ship and throw them all overboard.&nbsp; ...Er, no.&nbsp; We&#8217;ll be the officers, and they&#8217;ll be the deck hands.&nbsp; I&#8217;m going to wield the whip.�

April said, �Tomorrow morning it is.&nbsp; Mutiny on the Argo.&nbsp; We&#8217;ll go out and kick &#8217;m in the balls and take over the ship.&nbsp; I&#8217;ll take on James.&nbsp; Ivy, you take Rafiq.&nbsp; He deserves it from you.&nbsp; And Jenny, you take the Skipper.&nbsp; You&#8217;re going to kick &#8217;m in the balls, right?�

Giggling, we all agreed.&nbsp; The absurdity of the fantasy was bewitching.&nbsp; Kicking the Skipper in the balls was so far beyond anything I could ever actually do.

Then there was a knock at the door.&nbsp; We listened without saying anything.

�It&#8217;s me,� called Rafiq.&nbsp; The doorknob clicked as he tried to turn it, but it was locked.&nbsp; �Just checking to see if everything is okay.&nbsp; Do you need anything?�

�Get the hell away from here,� April called back at him.&nbsp; She grinned, listening for how he would respond to that.

�No, wait,� I called to him.&nbsp; �Could you bring us that ointment you put on me that other time I got whipped?�

�Oh...&nbsp; And while you&#8217;re at it, bring us something to eat,� April called to him.&nbsp; �We&#8217;re not coming out tonight.�

Rafiq agreed.&nbsp; About ten minutes later he knocked at the door again.&nbsp; April opened it just enough to allow him to pass a bag of stuff in.&nbsp; But I made real sure that he caught a glimpse of me giving him a big smile as he looked through the opening.

After locking the door, April checked out what he had brought us for food.&nbsp; A small container of rice and bean casserole left over from yesterday, not enough for all of us; a bag of baby-cut carrots, a liter carton of soy milk, and a box of low-fat crackers.&nbsp; It would do.

I wondered what the guys would be eating tonight.&nbsp; None of them had cooked anything since the voyage began.&nbsp; I imagined Rafiq would have cereal and soy milk for dinner, same as he had for breakfast.&nbsp; And that Skipper would eat beer nuts, washed down with rum, and James would eat something directly out of a can.&nbsp; But that&#8217;s just my imagination.&nbsp; Who knows what they were actually doing.

As we munched, Ivy said, �I&#8217;m through with Rafiq forever.&nbsp; He has a few engaging qualities, but basically I&#8217;ve lost interest.&nbsp; And he&#8217;s too short besides.�

�He&#8217;s not that short.&nbsp; He&#8217;s taller than you,� I replied.

�Well, so?&nbsp; He&#8217;s still a dweeb.�&nbsp; Ivy then went on to recite a couple of episodes indicating what she considered to be his defects.&nbsp; I found her complaints utterly unconvincing, mostly revealing her own self-centeredness.&nbsp; But I forced myself to keep quiet and act sympathetic.&nbsp; For me it was best if Ivy lose all interest in Rafiq.

After a bite to eat, we proceeded to put salve on our welts.&nbsp; Ivy insisted that we apply it to each other.&nbsp; As she lay on her stomach, propped on her elbows to keep the weight off her sore breasts, I smoothed it over her rear.&nbsp; She opened her legs.&nbsp; April put her fingers on her privates.&nbsp; Ivy wriggled in contentment.

As we continued, Ivy was clearly becoming aroused.&nbsp; She was grinding her loins on the floor.&nbsp; But suddenly she stopped and rolled over, perhaps not yet wishing to release her sexual tension.

�Now you have to put that stuff on my breasts, where you whacked me so hard.&nbsp; ...You nasty girl.�&nbsp; She grinned at me.

I had reservations about such intimate contact with Ivy.&nbsp; Despite the feel-good spirit of the moment, I was uncertain that everything was fully resolved between us.&nbsp; My sense was that the issue of Rafiq could still loom large.&nbsp; But I applied the ointment to her breasts.&nbsp; Her nipples were hard.&nbsp; My fingers bumped over them as I applied the ointment.

Laying there, Ivy squirmed as she arched her back and extended her arms above her head, stretching her front out to the maximum.&nbsp; She had an awesome body.&nbsp; Perfect-sized breasts, flat stomach, tight thighs.&nbsp; And she always carried herself like she knew what she had.

April brought her face toward Ivy&#8217;s crotch and extended her tongue to her clit.&nbsp; Ivy squirmed in appreciation.&nbsp; Warming up to the spirit of the moment I put my mouth to her nipple and sucked.&nbsp; The ointment tasted bitter.&nbsp; After a few moments, Ivy began moaning with satisfaction, quivering and gasping.&nbsp; Then she lay quiet.

After a while, sitting up, she said, �Now we have to put it on Jenny&#8217;s welts.&nbsp; Lie down on your stomach.�&nbsp; There was an aggressiveness in her tone.

I lay down on my stomach, propped on my elbows, so as not to press my sore breasts on the floor.&nbsp; I grunted as Ivy set herself astraddle on the small of my back, facing my bottom.&nbsp; It was not all that comfortable.&nbsp; She applied the ointment to my rear vigorously, not gently.&nbsp; She kneaded my buns, occasionally giving them a slap.

The way I was tightening my butt against her, she must have known that I was not comfortable with what she was doing.&nbsp; But I didn&#8217;t complain.&nbsp; If this was the price of peace, so be it.

Having finished applying the ointment to my rear, she gave me a couple hard slaps, one on each side of my bottom.&nbsp; Then getting off me, she told me to roll over.

I hesitated.&nbsp; I wasn&#8217;t sure I trusted her enough to present my front to her.&nbsp; Everything on the front is more sensitive.&nbsp; And she was not in a gentle mood.&nbsp; 

�Come on, roll over,� she repeated. �Let me attend to Rafiq&#8217;s new girlfriend.�

Slowly, I turned over on my back, saying, �Be gentle.&nbsp; My nipples are really sensitive now.�&nbsp; 

On my back, I took a deep breath and exhaled fully.&nbsp; I raised my arms over my head.&nbsp; I decided I was going to acquiesce to this dominatrix.&nbsp; I would to do whatever she said.&nbsp; I had stolen her boyfriend.&nbsp; Rafiq chose my innocence over this poised and beautiful woman.&nbsp; So now she could do whatever she wished to me.&nbsp; But she could never have Rafiq back.&nbsp; He was mine now.

Although I was convincing myself to acquiesce, in the back of my mind I knew there were limits to what I would accept from Ivy.&nbsp; But perhaps she was not going to push those limits. 

Lying on my back, I closed my eyes and relaxed.&nbsp; Ivy straddled my hips.&nbsp; Arms overhead, I crossed my wrists, imagining that I was bound.

My mind drifting freely into a medieval fantasy, I imagined that the Lady Ivy was going to punish me for stealing her man.&nbsp; Yes, despite the peasant girl circumstances in my fantasy, Sir Rafiq had recognized in my true worth and had taken me for his lady.&nbsp; Now he wore my kerchief in his helmet.&nbsp; But somehow I had happened into the clutches of Lady Ivy.&nbsp; She had already had me whipped.&nbsp; But I had taken it bravely.&nbsp; So now she was going to debase me sexually.

Ivy applied the salve to my breasts.&nbsp; She was gentle.&nbsp; But in my fantasy I had her molesting my body.&nbsp; In fact I arched my back, receptively encouraging her caress.&nbsp; But in my fantasy I was writhing under her torment.&nbsp; I pressed my loins upward into Ivy&#8217;s weight as she straddled my hips.

�Stick it in her,� I heard Ivy murmur to April.&nbsp; This jolted me from my reverie.&nbsp; I did not want Ivy sticking that gross dildo thing into me.

But then I considered that April, not Ivy, was going to do it.&nbsp;&nbsp; ...Well, in the spirit of peace maybe I should go along with that.&nbsp; I tried to relax and slip back into my fantasy:&nbsp; It seemed that Lady Ivy was going to have my good friend rape me with a horrid wooden penis.

I felt it touch my labia.&nbsp; It was really wet.&nbsp; April must have put lubricant on it.&nbsp; I am not naturally that moist.

April was pushing it into me.&nbsp; So big and hard.&nbsp; I grimaced as it slid in further and further.&nbsp; Finally, all the way in.

Ivy, still straddling me, shifted her weight so that I could press my clit onto her.&nbsp; I pressed upwards.&nbsp; Circular motions.&nbsp; I murmured with pleasure.&nbsp; Ivy continued playing gently with my nipples.&nbsp; I could feel a slight tremor in the dildo at the hands of April as she moved it in rhythm with me.&nbsp; The pressure to release my sexual tension was rising inexorably.

In my fantasy these women were holding me down and sexually stimulating me against my will, exploiting my erogenous zones in order to gain control of my volition.&nbsp; In my fantasy I didn&#8217;t want my body to betray me but was helpless against the onslaught of their perversions; they knew how to take advantage of my body&#8217;s weaknesses.

I didn&#8217;t know why the image of them taking me against my will was so tantalizing.&nbsp; On the other hand, what could be more obvious than the allure of the thought that Rafiq&#8217;s love for me had set in motion the events leading both to today&#8217;s whipping and to my current sexual debasement.&nbsp; My entire being was trembling with sexual energy. 

Over the top.&nbsp; The heat of orgasm radiated through me.&nbsp; Sublime pleasure.&nbsp;&nbsp; ...Unearthly bliss.&nbsp;&nbsp; ...Preternatural ecstasy.&nbsp; I continued pressing my loins against Ivy&#8217;s weight as April worked me with the dildo.

I bathed in the warmth of orgasmic release.&nbsp; This body, after taking in so much punishment, so much pain, was now immersed in so much pleasure.

As the rapture of orgasm ebbed, I lay still.&nbsp; Utterly satisfied.&nbsp; This is what I had earned after the unremitting torment of the strap, cane, and switch. 

After a time Ivy got off me and turned her attention to April.&nbsp; As the two girls got on together, I curled up and drifted into a little cat nap with that wooden penis still stuck into me.&nbsp; I realize that leaving it in might sound gross.&nbsp; I can&#8217;t really explain why I didn&#8217;t remove it; I don&#8217;t think there was further pleasure in it.&nbsp; Perhaps I felt I didn&#8217;t have the authority to remove it.

When I awoke a short while later, Ivy and April were lying quietly together, and the dildo had come out of me.&nbsp; After a time we roused ourselves, got dressed, and passed the evening quietly chatting.











Chapter 3: Bound for Adventure

The next morning April roused me, �Come on, we&#8217;re going to mutiny.&nbsp; You&#8217;re supposed to take on the Skipper.&nbsp; Let&#8217;s go.�

�Oh, sorry.&nbsp; Why didn&#8217;t you guys wake me earlier?&nbsp; Can you give me a few minutes?�

Ivy, who had already groomed herself to her usual immaculate state, said, �You look fine.&nbsp; Let&#8217;s go.�&nbsp; April opened the door, and both of them headed out.

Quickly putting on my shoes, I followed them out, combing my hair out as best I could as 
I went.&nbsp; 

After taking a detour to use the bathroom, I arrived on deck.&nbsp; James had his arm around April, and they were conversing quietly, looking out to sea.&nbsp; This was the first time I had seen April allow James to touch her since he had whipped her.

Ivy and Rafiq were conversing.&nbsp; I felt a wave of anxiety and jealousy, but I let it pass as quickly as it arose.&nbsp; Rafiq gave me an acknowledging glance and a faint smile while continuing to listen politely to Ivy.&nbsp; I had nothing to fear.

The Skipper hailed me.&nbsp; �Ho, Jenny.&nbsp; You&#8217;re looking bright and lively today.�

�Good morning, sir,� I replied.&nbsp; I glanced again at April and Ivy.&nbsp; It was obvious that this mutiny thing was merely a passing fantasy that none of us really expected to pull off.&nbsp; 

Nevertheless, I did take note that were it not just a fantasy, the Skipper was standing obliquely to me such that it would be rather difficult to kick him in the balls.&nbsp; But it struck me as a unique way to gage my physical relation to another person &#8211; whether I was in a position to kick them in the crotch.&nbsp; My new-found perspective tickled me.

Then my mind turned to wondering what kind of whipping the Skipper would give me if I tried successfully or unsuccessfully to kick him such.&nbsp; Would he hang me upside down, legs spread wide, and flog my pussy?&nbsp; I certainly did not want to find out.

�You always look so pert after a good whipping,� he continued.&nbsp; �You do seem to take naturally to them.�

There he was on this thing about me being good to whip.&nbsp; How was I going to counter this notion?&nbsp; �Please sir, they are not natural to me.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t want to be whipped.�

�Hey, whatever.&nbsp; But how about getting yourself down to the galley and making us some toast and eggs.&nbsp; We didn&#8217;t get much dinner last night, you know.�

Up to now everyone had been on their own for breakfast.&nbsp; But considering the dinner situation last night (or lack thereof), I thought it best to heed the request.&nbsp; I headed down to the galley and began preparing breakfast.

After a couple minutes, the Skipper joined me.&nbsp; He said, �I&#8217;m a little concerned about that caning Ivy gave you yesterday.&nbsp; And the way she lit into your titties with the switch.&nbsp; I think we should have a look.&nbsp; Make sure they are all right.�

I was appalled.&nbsp; Surely he didn&#8217;t think he had the authority to make me show myself whenever he wanted to look at my breasts.&nbsp; Instinctively I brought my hands together on my chest, my forearms over my breasts.&nbsp; �Really they&#8217;re okay.&nbsp; And there&#8217;s not much you could do even if they weren&#8217;t.&nbsp; ...And it&#8217;s not right for you to try to look at my body on such a pretext.�

�Oh my.&nbsp; Little Miss Modesty.&nbsp; What&#8217;s the big deal?&nbsp; I&#8217;ve already seen your tits, haven&#8217;t I?&nbsp; ...Anyway, in addition to being the captain of this vessel, I&#8217;m also the chief medical officer.&nbsp; It&#8217;s my responsibility to assure the health of the crew.&nbsp; So bring your hands down to your sides.�

I wasn&#8217;t going to buy his chief medical officer blather.&nbsp; Defiant, I crossed my arms over my chest.&nbsp; Even so, he began lifting the bottom of&nbsp; my tee-shirt.&nbsp; Having exposed my midriff, he paused and said, �You know, you&#8217;ve got a cute belly button.�

I frowned.&nbsp; �Is this the way a chief medical officer talks?�

�Well, perhaps I&#8217;m forgetting myself.&nbsp;&nbsp; ...It&#8217;s just that when a girl has such an exceptional body, I can&#8217;t help wondering whether she appreciates what she has.�

I pondered that.&nbsp; Certainly I don&#8217;t think of myself as having an exceptional body.&nbsp; I like it that I&#8217;m trim.&nbsp; But I&#8217;m understated relative to classic female attributes.

He tugged my shirt up my ribs.&nbsp; I kept my arms folded tightly across my chest to impede further upward movement.

�Stop being childishly modest, and put your hands behind your head,� he ordered.

I pouted at him defiantly.&nbsp; 

�I&#8217;m ordering you to put your hands behind your head.�&nbsp; He picked up the plastic spatula.&nbsp; �Do you hear me?�&nbsp; When I did not respond, he swatted me a couple times on the side of the thigh with it.&nbsp; I winced but held my ground.

With vigor he swatted me several more times on the thigh and then said, �I can see that a spatula on the legs or bottom is not going to phase the likes of you.&nbsp; Then I&#8217;ll spank your breasts with it till you learn to obey my rightful orders.�

As he raised the spatula before my breasts, I kept my arms crossed to protect myself.&nbsp; But when he grabbed hold of my wrist, I knew this was getting out of hand.&nbsp; �All right.&nbsp; All right.&nbsp; I&#8217;ll do what you say.&nbsp; But could I ask you to put down the spatula first?&nbsp;&nbsp; ...Please.�

As he eyed me, I gave him my most supplicating expression...&nbsp;&nbsp; It worked.&nbsp; He put down the spatula.&nbsp; 

I raised my arms, placing my hands behind my head, and he proceeded to lift my shirt, exposing my breasts.&nbsp; I felt humiliated and vulnerable.&nbsp; I kept my eyes down.&nbsp; 

He stood gazing at my breasts.&nbsp; Then he touched me, passing his fingers over the marks left by the switch.&nbsp; I looked down.&nbsp; My nipples were stiff.&nbsp; He bumped his fingers over them repeatedly.&nbsp; Then he took them between his fingers and slowly squeezed, gradually increasing pressure.

�Ow.&nbsp; Please.&nbsp; They&#8217;re still really sensitive.&nbsp; You know where Ivy was hitting me.�

He eased up.&nbsp; �Yes.&nbsp; Such good nipples.&nbsp; Such good tits...&nbsp; But that switch isn&#8217;t really the right implement for whipping a pretty girl&#8217;s titties on a regular basis.&nbsp; We may have to wait a little before we whip you some more.&nbsp; It&#8217;s a pity, isn&#8217;t it?�

�Oh please no.&nbsp; I haven&#8217;t done anything.&nbsp; Why do you have to whip me?�

�Oh.&nbsp; It has nothing much to do with anything you&#8217;ve done.&nbsp; So don&#8217;t fret about it.&nbsp; It has to do with you yourself.�

�Why do you keep saying that?&nbsp; I don&#8217;t want to be whipped any more than anyone else.&nbsp; And why do you have to do it on the breasts?&nbsp; I&#8217;m the least busty female on the boat.�

�You&#8217;d rather that April or Ivy got whipped instead?�

�No.&nbsp; I didn&#8217;t mean it that way.&nbsp; It&#8217;s just...�

�It&#8217;s just that you don&#8217;t appreciate how good your tits are.&nbsp; The apogee of impeccable nipples... that&#8217;s you.&nbsp; Those puffy nipples sticking out there just begging for the whip.�&nbsp; Now he was massaging my breasts.

�They&#8217;re not begging for the whip.&nbsp; And there&#8217;s nothing that unusual about my body.&nbsp; ...And there&#8217;s nothing I can do about how it is anyway.�

When he started kneading my breasts with even more vigor, I brought my arms down tightly across my chest, arresting his action.&nbsp; He took his hands away and stepped back.

�My examination indicates no injury,� he said, reverting to his chief medical officer pretense.&nbsp; �Your breasts should feel better by evening.�&nbsp; With that he turned and left the galley.

**********

It was late afternoon before I finally had an opportunity to talk to April alone in the cabin &#8211; about my issue with the Skipper, of course.

�April, I have to tell you some stuff the Skipper&#8217;s been saying to me.&nbsp; The first time was after James whipped you.�&nbsp; I went on to tell her the whole story about the Skipper approaching me in galley, concerned about what James had done.&nbsp; �He said to me &#8216;Jenny, there&#8217;s a certain kind of girl you can whip.&nbsp; And a certain kind of girl you can&#8217;t.&nbsp; You gotta be able to recognize the difference.&nbsp; The right kind of girl, when you whip her, she&#8217;ll be the best damn girl ever.&#8217;�

In the middle of my story Ivy came in.&nbsp; Initially that made me uptight, but she listened attentively and her expression was sympathetic, so I realized that there was no reason why she should not hear about my concerns.

I continued by telling of the morning&#8217;s encounter in the galley, when the Skipper made me let him examine my breasts and feel me up.

�You let him feel you up?� asked April.

�Well... yeah.&nbsp; I didn&#8217;t think I had a choice.�

�I&#8217;d give him a slap.�

�I don&#8217;t think I can do that.&nbsp; He&#8217;d give me another whipping.&nbsp; He&#8217;s already said he&#8217;s looking forward to the next opportunity to whip me.&nbsp; The problem is, I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s anything I can do to avoid it.�

�Oh,� said April.&nbsp; She was silent for moment, thinking.&nbsp; Then she said, �Don&#8217;t take this the wrong way when I say this, but I guess I&#8217;m wondering why you&#8217;re so concerned about being whipped.&nbsp; You&#8217;ve been punished that way before this voyage and I thought you sort of got off on it.�

�Hey.&nbsp; That&#8217;s not really fair,� I replied.&nbsp; I glanced at Ivy, wondering if she would think I was really weird.&nbsp; But her expression of sympathy and concern was unchanged.&nbsp; I continued, �I had never been flayed so bad on the breasts before this, and I hope never again.�

�Yeah, but I did that to you.&nbsp; It wasn&#8217;t the Skipper,� said Ivy.&nbsp; �And I&#8217;m sorry about that, but you know how I felt about you at the time.&nbsp; But do you think he&#8217;s going to give you another switching on your breasts?�

�No, he implied that wasn&#8217;t the right thing to use.�

�Well, you know,� said Ivy.&nbsp; �He told me that the cat-o-nine-tails he used on you was new and he had never used it before.&nbsp; He didn&#8217;t realize how bad it was.&nbsp; It&#8217;s those knots in it that hurt so much.�

�So what are you trying to say?&nbsp; That I should accept that I&#8217;m going to be whipped again, and hope he doesn&#8217;t use something too nasty?�

�Well if the pain was bearable, would you mind being whipped?� asked April.

�What do you mean &#8216;bearable&#8217;?&nbsp; It still hurts.&nbsp;&nbsp; ...And what about the humiliation of being stripped and physically chastised in front of a bunch of people.�

�Do you have a problem with that?� asked April.

�What kind of question is that?&nbsp; Of course I have a problem with it.�&nbsp; I frowned at April.&nbsp; �You know, I was feeling okay about myself until I started talking to you guys about this.&nbsp; Now you&#8217;re making me out to be some kind of weird... something.�

�Oh Jenny.&nbsp; Don&#8217;t take it that way.�&nbsp; April gave me a hug.&nbsp; �I&#8217;m not making any judgments.&nbsp; I admire your strength.�

Ivy said, �Jenny, have you noticed what a cheery mood you&#8217;re in after you get a whipping.�

�I am?�&nbsp; That took me by surprise.&nbsp; But the Skipper had said something like that to me too.&nbsp; Could it be true?

�Well, I don&#8217;t know, but it seems like you started getting along better with the Skipper after he started giving you whippings.�

�Oh.&nbsp; ...But still, it&#8217;s just not true that I like being whipped.&nbsp; That&#8217;s crazy.&nbsp; Why would I have even brought this up if I were happy being punished?�

�Well,� said April.&nbsp; �Is your issue that you don&#8217;t want to be singled out as being &#8216;the right kind of girl to whip,&#8217; as you put it?&nbsp; Or is it that you really don&#8217;t want to be whipped?�
�Both.�

�Well, how did you feel when both of us were to be whipped together?� asked Ivy.

�Well, that was different.&nbsp; I was just happy you were going to get whipped &#8211; of course I don&#8217;t feel that way about you now.&nbsp; But I was worried that I might not stand up to it as well as you.�

�Pffff!&nbsp; Fat chance of that,� interjected April.

�Listen, I don&#8217;t know where you&#8217;re going with this.&nbsp; But I don&#8217;t like being made to take my clothes off in front of everybody.&nbsp; And I don&#8217;t like getting corporal punishment in front of everybody.&nbsp; And nothing either of you can say is going to change that.�

�Well,� said April, �what if you&#8217;re strung up naked&nbsp; in front of your Rafiq, and whipped, and all the while you&#8217;re so beautiful he can&#8217;t take his eyes off you.&nbsp; And after they let you down he comforts you and nurses your welts.&nbsp; How would you feel about that?�

�Well...&nbsp; That&#8217;s sort of different.�

�Hey, let&#8217;s check on what Rafiq is up to,� said Ivy.&nbsp; She stepped out of our compartment, then returned.&nbsp; �He&#8217;s in their compartment, reading.&nbsp; You want to go to him ...helpless and vulnerable, right?&nbsp; Here, we&#8217;ll tie your hands behind you.�&nbsp; She was laughing.

�No, don&#8217;t....&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me go,� I said, giggling as she took hold of my wrist.&nbsp; Getting up, I put up token resistance, all in good fun, while they bound my wrists behind me with a pair of Ivy&#8217;s pantyhose.&nbsp; 

�There.&nbsp; Now how about if we gag you?� asked Ivy.

�Please no.&nbsp; I&#8217;m at your mercy.�&nbsp; Still I was giggling as she wrapped a neckerchief across my mouth.&nbsp; I was tantalized by the prospect of being sent out to Rafiq this way.

Ivy then untied the back of my halter top, saying, �You won&#8217;t be needing this, I don&#8217;t think.�

Trying to resist as she pulled it off me, I said, �No, don&#8217;t.&nbsp; Somebody might see me,� muffled and lisping through the gag.&nbsp; Of course, by &#8216;somebody&#8217; I meant the Skipper or James.

�There&#8217;s nobody on board who hasn&#8217;t seen you before, and more compromised than this,� replied Ivy, smiling as she eyed my naked top.&nbsp; �Nice perky tits.�&nbsp; She stroked my nipples.&nbsp; �But you need something more.&nbsp; A little something I borrowed from the Skipper.�&nbsp; She turned and began probing through her luggage.&nbsp; Meanwhile, standing behind me, April was caressing my shoulders.

Finding what she wanted, Ivy then turned to me again.&nbsp; She was holding a couple of little metal clips, like toy clothes pins, connected together by a slender chain.&nbsp; I thought uh-oh; I knew I was going to get pinched but I wasn&#8217;t sure where.

She eyed me for several moments, grinning slyly.&nbsp; �We know how modest you are.&nbsp; You can wear these to cover yourself just a little.�&nbsp; She was looking at my breasts.

�Nooo...�&nbsp; I shook by head vigorously.&nbsp; As I squirmed unsuccessfully to avoid her advance, she took hold of my left breast and put the clip to the nipple.&nbsp; She was going to get me where I was most sensitive.&nbsp; As she released her grip, it clamped hard onto the nub of my nipple.&nbsp; I gasped.&nbsp; The sensation was electric.&nbsp; As I stood paralyzed by the nipple pinch, she applied the other one to my right nipple.&nbsp; I gasped anew.&nbsp; Despite the overwhelming sensation, I was still aware that April from behind was kissing my ear.

�Okay,� said Ivy.&nbsp; �Let&#8217;s send you on your way.�&nbsp; With April hugging me affectionately from behind, I stood before Ivy, half naked, bound, gagged, and nipple clipped.

�You look pretty good,� she said.&nbsp; But those shorts have got to go.&nbsp; She started to yank them down, together with my undies.

�No!� I cried, muffled through the gag.&nbsp; I resisted strongly, pressing April backward against the wall.&nbsp; But Ivy took hold of the clips on my nipples and shook vigorously.&nbsp; The agony forced me to yield immediately.&nbsp; I let her strip me completely.

�One last thing,� said Ivy.&nbsp; She turned to her berth.&nbsp; From under her pillow she pulled out that horrid wooden dildo.&nbsp; �Now spread your legs.�

�No, no, no!� I shook my head vigorously, pressing April backward again.

Ivy eyed my clipped nipples.&nbsp; �Do I need to apply persuasion again?� she asked.

I knew I had to acquiesce.&nbsp; I closed my eyes and tried to relax.&nbsp; As April, behind me, continued hugging and caressing me, Ivy probed the dildo to my pussy, pressing it in.&nbsp; It hurt.&nbsp; �Too dry,� I gasped through the gag.&nbsp; But she continued forcing it, like a rasp, all the way in.

Ivy then opened the door and April pushed me out, whispering, �You&#8217;ll knock &#8217;m dead.�&nbsp; On the way out Ivy gave me a couple hard slaps on the rear.

No doubt Rafiq had heard the sound of those slaps, for he was looking up expectantly when I appeared in the men&#8217;s compartment.&nbsp; Awkwardly I made my way to his berth as he rose to my aid.&nbsp; It was so humiliating to have that long dildo sticking out of me.

What was really bad is that the Skipper was taking a snooze in there.&nbsp; I had to walk right past him, praying that he would not awaken.&nbsp; At his side I noticed there was a paperback book titled �The Cheerleader&#8217;s Initiation�.&nbsp; The cover had an illustration of a busty girl, spreadeagle suspended between goal posts, the football team lined up to fuck her, and coach behind, paddling her.&nbsp; How gross.

�Help,� I tried to whisper through my gag.

�A damsel in distress.&nbsp; How fetching,� Rafiq whispered, smiling.&nbsp; �Problems among the girls again?&nbsp; From the sound of all that giggling a few minutes ago, I thought you were having a good time.�

He stood staring at my nipples.&nbsp; The clips were sticking straight out.&nbsp; Amused, he bobbed them up and down.&nbsp; �Don&#8217;t.&nbsp; Don&#8217;t.&nbsp; Don&#8217;t,� I whispered, desperately shaking my head.&nbsp; �Hurts!�

�Would you like me to ungag you?&nbsp; It&#8217;s hard to understand you.�

I nodded vigorously.&nbsp; Rafiq then slowly drew his attention away from my tormented breasts and slipped his fingers under the gag.&nbsp; For some time he just caressed my cheeks.&nbsp; Finally he slipped the gag out of my mouth and let it drop to my neck.

�Untie my hands.&nbsp; Or get these clamps off me.&nbsp; They&#8217;re killing me.&nbsp; I got to get them off.�

But he only responded by kissing my lips.&nbsp; I realized that if Rafiq was going to rescue me, as I knew he ultimately would, it would be a slow and sensual process.&nbsp; I also realized that much as I wanted those clips off, I could bear them on my nipples &#8211; and would have to bear them &#8211; until such time that he freed me.

Our lips pressed together, he pulled me into an embrace.&nbsp; The clips jabbed into my breasts as we pressed together.&nbsp; I gasped with pain.&nbsp; 

It was a collision of opposing sensations.&nbsp; The tender warmth of his embrace coupled with biting torment of those metal clips simultaneously pinching and jabbing into my nipples.

Holding me close with his left arm wrapped around my back, he caressed the side of my breast with his right hand.&nbsp; Then he squeezed his thumb in between our bodies and pressed it into my nipple, aggravating the bite of the clip.&nbsp; I gasped momentarily but returned my lips to his.

As he continued tormenting my nipple, I became aware of the pressure of his erect penis through his shorts, against my hip.&nbsp; Why do guys get so much pleasure from my pain?

Finally he released his embrace.&nbsp; Still, however, I continued pressing against him, my nether region to his thigh.

Rafiq placed his hands on my shoulders, and pressed down.&nbsp; �On your knees.�

I dropped to my knees.&nbsp; He pulled out his penis, a big boner.&nbsp; He expected me to give him a blow job.&nbsp; But I felt so compromised doing so in this situation.

Nevertheless, I acquiesced.&nbsp; From my kneeling position, I brought myself lower, resting my weight on my left calf and heel, my right knee off the floor, trying to maintain clearance for the external end of the double-ended, half-meter long dildo.&nbsp; Still it pressed onto the floor, forcing itself deep into me.&nbsp; I took his penis in my mouth, licking and sucking.

What I was doing seemed to be satisfactory to him.&nbsp; At least he didn&#8217;t try to ram it down my throat.&nbsp; But he did take hold of the chain holding my nipple clips and give a tug.&nbsp; I sucked more vigorously.&nbsp; If only I could release his sexual energy, I was sure he would release me from this torment.

I could hear the Skipper stirring quietly behind me.&nbsp; I hoped he had not awakened.&nbsp; No such luck.&nbsp; The next thing I knew, his fingers were stroking over my clit.&nbsp; I squirmed.

�Stay down.� murmured Rafiq, wrenching my clipped nipples.&nbsp; I let out a gasp of pain, but immediately resumed sucking as vigorously as I could.

Skipper, sitting in a position similar to my own, pressed his body against mine, his arms around the front of me in a tight embrace.&nbsp; With one hand he fingered my clit, with the other he kneaded the softness of my breasts.&nbsp; I could feel his stiff penis pressing against me, locked between our bodies.&nbsp; He was rubbing against me rhythmically.

As this continued interminably, my feelings alternated between being aroused and being freaked out that two guys were doing this to me.&nbsp; The next thing I knew, Rafiq&#8217;s penis was palpitating, squirting cum into my mouth.&nbsp; A few moments later, Skipper came off, his warm cum launched onto my back as he pressed orgasmically against me.

This whole experience was beyond freaky.&nbsp; The sliminess of Rafiq&#8217;s cum in my mouth, my lips still rapped around his penis.&nbsp; A dirty old man rubbing himself against my rear.&nbsp; And me, bound helpless, completely under their power.&nbsp; Those beastly metal clips biting into my nipples, the torment exacerbated by Rafiq&#8217;s continual jerking on the chain.&nbsp; That long loathsome dildo rammed into my cunt, its far end pressed onto the floor, such that it transposed all of my movements into its own motion inside me.&nbsp; And the Skipper&#8217;s fingers incessantly stimulating my clit, making me quiver, further heightening the motions of the dildo.

I hadn&#8217;t even recognized that it was nearing when I was overtaken by orgasm, staggering in intensity.&nbsp; I pressed myself against Rafiq&#8217;s leg, hard, hard, hard.&nbsp; Holding my breath, I closed my eyes, deliriously plunging into the depths of rhapsodic ecstasy.

Lost in rapture, I was swept away by the tide of euphoria.&nbsp; Sensual gratification, supreme.&nbsp; Immersed in a sea of pleasure, time and space vanished; the boundaries between our bodies dissolved.

How long this went on, who knows, but as this blissful state gradually subsided, the biting pain in my nipples began to return.&nbsp; �Please release my nipples.&nbsp; Please, Rafiq.&nbsp; It&#8217;s hurting me.�

�Ah, yes.&nbsp; Your nipples.�&nbsp; Dropping to his knees he ran his fingers around them.&nbsp; �Such fine nipples.&nbsp; Why do we get such pleasure out of tormenting them?�

�Please, Rafiq.�&nbsp; A teardrop ran down my cheek and fell on his hand.&nbsp; He licked the tear off his hand like it was some precious elixir, then took hold of the clips and slowly released the pressure.&nbsp; I panted as the biting intensity was replaced by a throbbing pain, slow to subside.

The Skipper unbound my wrists, repeatedly muttering, �One hell of a girl.&nbsp; You&#8217;re one hell of a girl.�

Thus released I crawled onto Rafiq&#8217;s berth and slowly removed that dildo.&nbsp; I felt embarrassed to have Rafiq and especially the Skipper standing there watching me do it.

�I&#8217;ll take that thing now,� said the Skipper when the end finally slipped out.&nbsp; �And what about those nipple clips.&nbsp; They look like ones that belong to me.&nbsp; How did they end up on you?�

�Ivy put them on me.&nbsp; She said she borrowed them from you.�

�Borrowed them from me?&nbsp; Is that so.&nbsp; How would she even&nbsp; know I had them?&nbsp;&nbsp; ...I think I&#8217;m going have some words with her ...when I&#8217;m in the mood.�

I turned away from them and covered myself with the sheet.&nbsp; Rafiq then lay down beside me, and hugged me.&nbsp; And the Skipper continued sitting there beside the bed, lightly stroking my calf.

*********

Later in the day, as I reflected on what had happened, I was troubled.&nbsp; Alone on deck with Rafiq late that night, I confronted him about it.

�I don&#8217;t feel that good about what happened this afternoon.&nbsp; That was... gross.&nbsp; The two of you teaming up on me that way.&nbsp; It made me feel like... so trashy.&nbsp; That big dildo stuck in me.&nbsp; And the two of you coming off on me.�

�Well, we didn&#8217;t stick the dildo in you.&nbsp; You women did that yourselves.&nbsp; And you were the one that sought me out, all naked and tied up.�

�Well... Rafiq.&nbsp; I&#8217;m trying to talk to you about how I feel.&nbsp; So instead of talking about how I feel, you&#8217;re all fucking defensive about it.&nbsp; And trying to make me feel even shittier.� 

�I&#8217;m trying to make you feel shitty?&nbsp; And you&#8217;re trying to make me feel good?&nbsp; The first thing you said was that Skipper and I had &#8216;teamed up&#8217; on you.&nbsp; You made sound like we gang raped you.�

�Well...�&nbsp; I pondered that for several moments.&nbsp; �I&#8217;m sorry.&nbsp; It&#8217;s not about what you did.&nbsp; It&#8217;s about what I did... what I let happen.�

Rafiq was silent for a moment.&nbsp; Then he said, �Sorry I got defensive.&nbsp; ...Don&#8217;t blame yourself about this thing.&nbsp; You were wonderful.&nbsp; It was my fault for letting things get out of hand.&nbsp; I should have untied you right away. ...But I just couldn&#8217;t.&nbsp; You looked so good.&nbsp; So irresistible.&nbsp; And I thought that you were into it too.&nbsp; You did end up coming off, didn&#8217;t you?�

�Well, yeah.&nbsp; And that&#8217;s a lot of what I feel so uncomfortable about.&nbsp; I just feel so... uh... like I&#8217;m a...&nbsp; oh, I don&#8217;t know.�&nbsp; I was unwilling to use the term pain slut.&nbsp; �What I did seemed so... inappropriate...&nbsp; I know that&#8217;s a really dumb word.�

�You didn&#8217;t do anything wrong.&nbsp; It was me.&nbsp; I have this, like, Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde thing.&nbsp; I get this charge out of you being a damsel in distress.&nbsp; But it doesn&#8217;t fit any other facet of my nature.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t ordinarily go around trying to cause pain.&nbsp; It&#8217;s just this sexual thing.&nbsp; Once the sexual energy is blown out, I revert to being a normal person again.�

�Well, yeah, but that&#8217;s okay because I&#8217;m the opposite number.&nbsp; I like offering myself up to you,� I said.&nbsp; But of course I didn&#8217;t tell him that I like having the power to transform him from the well-mannered Dr. Jekyll into the animalistic Mr. Hyde.&nbsp; 

Instead I said, �But I&#8217;m having trouble reconciling that I submit to all the other stuff that&#8217;s been going on around here.&nbsp; It seems so demeaning.�

�Are you crazy?&nbsp; Your receptiveness to adversity puts you at the pinnacle.&nbsp; Everybody thinks you&#8217;re awesome.�

�Oh god, do I have to hear more of this,� I murmured.&nbsp; But I gave Rafiq a little smile.&nbsp; �Next thing I know, you&#8217;re going to be the one plying the whip on me.�

�Yeah.&nbsp; Sounds good, doesn&#8217;t it?�










Chapter 4.&nbsp; The Unsolicited Offer 

It was late in the afternoon of the next day when the Skipper confronted Ivy about the nipple clips she �borrowed� from him.&nbsp; I did not hear the initial interaction.&nbsp; When Rafiq and I emerged from below, there was Ivy, bare breasted, hands behind her head, facing the Skipper.&nbsp; James was at the helm; the breeze was stiff.

The Skipper was saying, �You need to learn to respect other people&#8217;s property &#8211; and their personal space.�

Although he was referring to his cabin space, I couldn&#8217;t help thinking that I wished he would start respecting my personal space &#8211; that is, stop taking liberties with my body.

Unwavering, Ivy looked into his eyes.&nbsp; The Skipper continued, �You wanted these clips.&nbsp; So now you can wear them.�

Ivy&#8217;s mouth hardened just a little, but she didn&#8217;t say a word. She just continued resolutely eyeing him.

The Skipper passed his fingers over her breasts.&nbsp; Then he started kneading them.&nbsp; Ivy squirmed just a little, but continued looking up into his face.&nbsp; I admired her mettle.

Then he took hold of her nipples and pulled upwards.&nbsp; Ivy grimaced and bit her lip.&nbsp; She was on her toes stretching her body upwards, but she kept her hands behind her head.&nbsp; I didn&#8217;t think I could have maintained such composure.

Finally the Skipper released her.&nbsp; Ivy retreated a step, breathing heavily, and bringing her hands from behind her head, partially covered her breasts with her wrists.

�Hands behind head please, while I clip your nipples,� said the Skipper.

Ivy returned her hands behind her head.&nbsp; With an expression of scorn, she thrust out her chest.&nbsp; Grasping each breast in turn, the Skipper applied a clip to each nipple.&nbsp; Ivy winced initially but otherwise maintained her poise.&nbsp; In no way did she acknowledge the presence of us onlookers.&nbsp; 

I glanced at James.&nbsp; He was watching intently, with an expression of amusement.&nbsp; But I felt uncomfortable gaping at this spectacle.&nbsp; I wondered if we were invading their privacy.&nbsp; Maybe Rafiq and I should turn around and go back below.

I tugged lightly at Rafiq&#8217;s hand, but he ignored me.&nbsp; So I continued watching.&nbsp; I have to admit that even though I was getting along with Ivy much better than before, I could still feel a morbid fascination in watching her get punished.&nbsp; I wondered if she would lose her poise.

�How do your tits feel now?� asked the Skipper.&nbsp; �Pretty good, eh?�

Ivy made no reply.

�Now bend over and hold onto the bulkhead, arms straight out,� he said.&nbsp; Ivy bent over, and grasped the bulkhead, body horizontal, legs vertical.&nbsp; Her bikini bottom was skimpy enough that&nbsp; her buns were plenty exposed.

The Skipper turned to his punishment implements.&nbsp; There was the long cane he had made Ivy and I use on each other, and there was a whip.&nbsp; He took up the whip.&nbsp; It had a meter-long single thong at the end of a slender, stiff meter-long crop.&nbsp; I had not seen this one before.&nbsp; He seemed to have an endless supply of implements for punishing us.

He flicked it through the air a couple times.&nbsp; Then he flicked it across Ivy&#8217;s butt, not very hard.&nbsp; Ivy shifted her weight subtly but otherwise gave no acknowledgment of the stroke.&nbsp; 

He flicked it across her again, then again, and again, progressively harder.&nbsp; Then he paused and said, �Let&#8217;s take down your bikini bottom.&nbsp; ...Just hold your position.�

He then stroked his hand over her bottom several times.&nbsp; He might have touched her pussy through the covering fabric; I&#8217;m not sure.&nbsp; Then with his hands on the sides of the bikini bottom, he slid it off her and down her legs.&nbsp; She stepped out of it and pushed it away with her toe.

He then stepped back and eyed her.&nbsp; She held her position, motionless.&nbsp; Then he drew back the whip and laid it hard across her butt.&nbsp; Then again and again, getting up a steady rhythm.&nbsp; Ivy was breathing hard but otherwise made no sound and not much movement.&nbsp; She kept her back arched, boldly presenting her bottom to whip.

I think I felt a little threatened that she could take the whip with so little fear and so much poise.&nbsp; I didn&#8217;t think I maintained that kind of composure.&nbsp; But I wondered if maybe that particular whip just didn&#8217;t hurt much.&nbsp; A provocative notion entered my mind that it might be okay to be whipped if it didn&#8217;t hurt so much.&nbsp; But I quickly dispelled the thought.&nbsp; I hate being whipped.

It was with vigor that the Skipper was now bringing the whip down on her legs.&nbsp; Ivy was squirming and gasping audibly.&nbsp; Finally the Skipper paused his exertions.&nbsp; Ivy let out a sigh and brought one hand back to feel her bottom and thighs.

�Just hold your position.&nbsp; We&#8217;re not done yet.�

Ivy return her hand to the bulkhead.&nbsp; The Skipper began feeling her.&nbsp; The marks left by the whip were not all that conspicuous.&nbsp; I wondered why she got off easy after stealing his stuff, while for a simple cooking mistake I had been whipped so hard with that beastly cat-o-nine-tails with the knotted thongs.&nbsp; I felt a bit resentful.

As she maintained her bent over position, the Skipper began feeling her breasts, diddling with those nipple clips, bobbing them back and forth.&nbsp; Now Ivy was squirming, trying to avoid his prodding hands.&nbsp; I think I felt a bit of satisfaction seeing her tormented to her limits &#8211; not necessarily out of malice toward Ivy, but more that she should share some of what I had been experiencing.

Then he took hold of one of the nipple clips and gave Ivy&#8217;s breast a jiggly shaking.&nbsp; Too much.&nbsp; Ivy yelped and brought one hand across to fend him off.&nbsp; He withdrew.

�Just had to see what kind of reaction I could get out of you this afternoon,� said the Skipper. �You take the whip really well, Ivy.�

Hearing that was disconcerting.&nbsp; I recognized that it stemmed from a sort of jealousy.&nbsp; But jealousy of Ivy while she was naked and whipped?&nbsp; How sick.&nbsp; I rebuked myself.

As I turned my thoughts to Rafiq, I realized that he was absorbed in watching the spectacle of Ivy&#8217;s punishment.&nbsp; That triggered even more disturbing feelings in me.

�Now spread your legs, and I&#8217;ll whip you some more,� said the Skipper.&nbsp; �Further apart.&nbsp; ...Keep going.&nbsp;&nbsp; ...That&#8217;s good.&nbsp; Now arch your back more.�&nbsp; With thong arrested against the whip handle, the Skipper tapped it on the small of Ivy&#8217;s back.&nbsp; �Get your bottom up there.&nbsp; You know you deserve this.�

Ivy&#8217;s vulva was prominently displayed.&nbsp; I looked at Rafiq.&nbsp; He was entranced, damn it.

The Skipper lashed the whip across her butt again several times.&nbsp; Then he started lashing Ivy&#8217;s left leg, the whip wrapping around the inside of her thigh.&nbsp; Ivy gasped loudly with each stroke.&nbsp; As the Skipper continued, Ivy was writhing with each stroke, but still she maintained her position, legs apart.

Then the Skipper lashed her hard right on the pussy.&nbsp; Ivy gave a screech and brought her hand back to protect herself.

�Ah, yeah,� said the Skipper.&nbsp; �That was a good one.&nbsp; Let&#8217;s do some more like that.�

�No, please no more.�

Ivy was finally reduced to begging.&nbsp; In one sense I was pleased that she got her comeuppance.&nbsp; But I was rankled that this old man would take advantage of a young woman by whipping her like that.

�Get that hand back on the bulkhead,� he ordered.&nbsp; Ivy nursed her pussy for a few more moments before she complied.&nbsp; Then he gave her another hard whip stroke, again snapping it right on the pussy.

�Ooooh...&nbsp; god...&nbsp; Don&#8217;t.�&nbsp; Again she brought her hand back.

�Well, how about if we have Rafiq whip you?&nbsp; Yeah, let&#8217;s have Rafiq whip you now.�

Ivy immediately straightened and turned.&nbsp; �Absolutely not.&nbsp; I won&#8217;t let Rafiq touch me with that whip.�&nbsp; She was really upset.

Rafiq interjected, �I&#8217;m not going to whip Ivy.&nbsp; That would be totally inappropriate now.&nbsp; You ought to know that.�

I was relieved that Rafiq realized how hurtful that would be for him to discipline Ivy.&nbsp; I knew she was carrying a lot of bitterness from their breakup.

But the Skipper persisted, �I order you to whip Ivy.&nbsp; And if you give me any backtalk, I&#8217;ll have you keelhauled.�

Rafiq looked at him like he was crazy.&nbsp; Then he shook his head and laughed.&nbsp; �You are suffering delusions of grandeur.�

�You mutinous punk.&nbsp; I&#8217;m going to lock you in the brig for the rest of the voyage.�

�You moron.&nbsp; This boat doesn&#8217;t have a brig.�

�I&#8217;ll lock you in the aft storage compartment.�

�Now how are you going to do that?&nbsp; Like &#8216;Oh please crawl into the storage compartment so I can lock you in.&#8217;&nbsp; ...Now you listen to me, you cretin.&nbsp; If you don&#8217;t shut up, I may decide to stuff you in there.&nbsp; And don&#8217;t think I can&#8217;t do it.�

�I ought to give you a whipping.�&nbsp; The Skipper flicked the whip menacingly.&nbsp; His behavior was so erratic, so inexplicable, I was sure he must have heavily fortified himself with alcohol before confronting Ivy.&nbsp; I was frightened.

Rafiq eyed him calmly.&nbsp; �Put that thing away before you hurt yourself with it.�

The Skipper flicked the whip at Rafiq.&nbsp; It seemed tentative, not a hard stroke, and Rafiq blocked it with his arm.&nbsp; But it really pissed off Rafiq.&nbsp; �You son of a bitch.&nbsp; Now I&#8217;ve had enough of you.&nbsp; You know what?&nbsp; I&#8217;m going to throw you overboard.&nbsp; Right now.&nbsp; Maybe come back in a few hours and pick you up, if you&#8217;re still afloat.�

As the Skipper threatened with his whip, Rafiq started closing in on him.&nbsp; Although shorter than the Skipper, Rafiq is strong and agile.&nbsp; If he wanted to throw the Skipper overboard, I was sure he could do it.

I looked at James, at the helm.&nbsp; He was looking forward into the distance, assiduously avoiding apparent regard for what was happening.

But I was frightened.&nbsp; �Please stop, both of you.�

�Stay out of this, Jenny,� said Rafiq.&nbsp; �The Skipper needs to soak his head.�

This was too much.&nbsp; Throwing a drunken old man overboard seemed really dangerous &#8211; in this wind it would take time to bring the boat around for him.&nbsp; I had to distract them somehow.&nbsp; I had to think of something.

�Rafiq!&nbsp; Stop!&nbsp; I agree you shouldn&#8217;t whip Ivy.&nbsp; So I&#8217;ll take her punishment.&nbsp; Whip me instead.&nbsp; But please just stop!�

It worked!&nbsp; Both guys turned toward me, relaxing their aggressive postures.&nbsp; Their scowling faces brightened.

�Whip you instead?&nbsp; Why?�&nbsp; Asked Rafiq.&nbsp; But I could tell that he was receptive.

�Uh...&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, it isn&#8217;t right that you should whip Ivy.�&nbsp; I was having trouble articulating a sound reason why I should be whipped in her place.

�Well, what do you think, Skipper?� asked Rafiq.&nbsp; �Should we let Jenny take Ivy&#8217;s place, and I&#8217;ll give her a whipping?�

�Sure, why not?&nbsp; Kinda in the tradition of a whipping boy.&nbsp; Here you go,� said the Skipper, smiling as he handed Rafiq the whip.&nbsp; It was bizarre how quickly their animosity dissolved.&nbsp; Did the prospect of me getting a whipping have that kind of power?

I stood facing Rafiq.&nbsp; I was wearing short shorts and a grey cotton V-front athletic outerwear bra top.&nbsp; Although I waited for some instructions, he gave none.&nbsp; He just eyed me with the trace of a smile on his lips and a twinkle in his eyes ...and that menacing whip in his hand.

I had butterflies in my stomach.&nbsp; I was afraid of the whip, and yet in some perverse way excited by the prospect of being disciplined by Rafiq.&nbsp; And aroused at the prospect of sacrificing myself to spare someone else.

Finally he flicked the whip on my legs.&nbsp; It was not a hard stroke.&nbsp; But I bit my lip, perhaps instinctively trying to look coy.&nbsp; He laid the whip across my legs again, harder.&nbsp; Then again, and again.&nbsp; The whip made a whining hiss as it sliced air, then terminated in a resounding thack as it hit my flesh.

With each stroke he increased the intensity of the sting.&nbsp; I stood squirming, biting my lip.&nbsp; He continued lashing me vigorously on the legs.&nbsp; I was gasped audibly with each hard stroke.&nbsp; I knew my demeanor under the whip did not match Ivy&#8217;s brassy manner.&nbsp; But in general Ivy&#8217;s overconfident bearing is not something I can naturally aspire to, and certainly not under the duress of a whipping.

�Hey!&nbsp; Who said you could take those off?�&nbsp; It was the Skipper, addressing Ivy.&nbsp; She had taken the clips off her nipples.

�Oh.&nbsp; I thought Jenny had agreed to take my punishment.&nbsp; Shouldn&#8217;t she be wearing these?&nbsp; Do you want me to put them on her tits?�

Now that really annoyed me.&nbsp; Stopping an ugly fight by volunteering to take her whipping had nothing to do with volunteering to let her torment my nipples.&nbsp; �No.&nbsp; You may not put those on me.�

�All right.&nbsp; Then here.�&nbsp; Ivy handed the clips to the Skipper as if she expected him to put them on me.

�I don&#8217;t want those things on me, period.&nbsp; I only agreed to accept the punishment the Skipper wanted Rafiq to give you.&nbsp; You are not to volunteer me for anything else.�

Feeling up her breasts, the Skipper said, �Well Ivy, I guess I&#8217;ll have to put them back on you for the duration of Jenny&#8217;s whipping.�

Frowning at him, Ivy pushed his hand aside and crossed her arms over her breasts.&nbsp; �I don&#8217;t want those things on me the whole time.&nbsp; Rafiq is intentionally drawing it out for as long as he can.&nbsp; He hasn&#8217;t even made her take her clothes off yet.�

�So he hasn&#8217;t.&nbsp; But we&#8217;re patient, aren&#8217;t we?&nbsp; After all, she&#8217;s taking the punishment you deserve.&nbsp; In the meantime your nipples will just have to feel the pinch.&nbsp; Hands behind your head and let&#8217;s watch Jenny take a whipping.�

Frowning at him, Ivy acquiesced, slowly bringing her hands behind her head.&nbsp; The Skipper slipped behind her, placing his hands on her ribs just below the breasts.&nbsp; He did not immediately place the clips.

In the meantime April came up from below, looking a bit surprised at seeing both Ivy and me in trouble and being punished.&nbsp; She went over to James, and he spoke to her quietly, apparently about what was happening.

Rafiq gave me a hard stinging stroke wrapping around my thighs.&nbsp; Then another.&nbsp; And two more again.

�Well Jenny,� he said.&nbsp; �Are you ready to bare yourself?�

I hesitated.&nbsp; Since I was volunteering for this, couldn&#8217;t I ask for some latitude on the conditions?&nbsp; �I think I&#8217;m wearing little enough now.&nbsp; You&#8217;re not having any trouble finding bare skin to sting.�

�Whip you with your clothes on?&nbsp; Get real.�&nbsp; Then he lashed the whip onto the deck.&nbsp; It hit with a loud smack.

�Doesn&#8217;t sound as good as when it hits your flesh,� he said.&nbsp; �Listen.�&nbsp; He drew back the whip and snapped it hard across my ribs.

�Ow!&nbsp; Shit!�&nbsp; Instinctively I brought my arms to protect my body.&nbsp; The sting overwhelmed any notice of the sound.

�Off with the clothes, Jenny.&nbsp; If you give me a hard time, I&#8217;ll whip you extra.�

I eyed him for a moment.&nbsp; Was he making his transition from Dr. Jekyll to Mr. Hyde?&nbsp; Yet I didn&#8217;t think he would really harm me with the whip, sting though it may.

While trying to maintain a demure demeanor, I began to lift off my bra top, exposing the base of my breasts.&nbsp; But I stopped short of my nipples, and having decided to give Rafiq a hard time I said, �Somebody might see me.�

�Don&#8217;t worry, nobody&#8217;s watching,� Rafiq replied, smiling.

I glanced around.&nbsp; All eyes were on me.&nbsp; I said, �I can&#8217;t take my clothes off in front of everybody.&nbsp; If you want me naked, you&#8217;ll have to strip me.�

Partly I wanted the physical contact with Rafiq.&nbsp; Partly I just wanted to act bratty enough to feel that I deserved to be whipped.

I could see that Rafiq was enticed.&nbsp; He came around behind me.&nbsp; Not sure what I should do with my hands, I raised them to fluff out my hair.

�Oh...� I murmured as he pulled the stiff crop portion of the whip against the base of my breasts.&nbsp; I leaned my head back against his shoulder, offering no resistance.&nbsp; It&#8217;s hard to describe my emotion:&nbsp; a bit of fear mixed with this perverse yearning to have him punish me.&nbsp; A feeling that my sacrifice gave me an irresistible sexual allure.

Exposing my breasts, he pressed the stiff part of the whip onto my now stiff nipples.&nbsp; Pressing back against him, I looked up at him over my shoulder, still keeping my hands in my hair, letting him do as he wished with my body.

He left off harrying my breasts and pulled my top off over head.&nbsp; I turned around to him, putting my arms around his neck, perhaps partly to keep my bare front from being displayed to the all and sundry, but mostly just to hug him.

�I know I have to be whipped, but still...� I murmured to him before his lips met mine.

As we kissed, he loosened my shorts and drew them and my undies part way down.&nbsp; But they were much too snug for gravity alone to bring them the rest of way down.&nbsp; Feeling it more humiliating to have my butt out and shorts part way down than to be completely naked, I broke our embrace and took them the rest of the way down.

�There, are you satisfied now?� I sighed.

�Do you feel that your body was just made to be punished?�

�Well, it seems that you do, so I guess my fate is to suffer.�

�So it seems...� he said softly.&nbsp; Then he pulled the thong of the whip between my legs.&nbsp; As I again embraced him, he yanked it up into my slit.&nbsp; I winced.

�Hey, you need some good rope for that,� said the Skipper.&nbsp; Opening a storage compartment, he pulled out a coil of rope.&nbsp; Inwardly I groaned when I saw that he hadn&#8217;t picked out smooth-braided synthetic manila rope.&nbsp; No, he had to pick out that rough crappy sisal rope.

Keeping my knees together in no way impeded the Skipper from slipping the rope between my thighs. With Rafiq holding one end and the Skipper holding the other end, they pulled it up into my slit.&nbsp; Still embracing Rafiq, I bit my lip as they tugged up hard.

�Ease up, Rock,� said the Skipper.&nbsp; Rafiq relaxed his pull, allowing the Skipper to drag the rope through my crotch.

�Ooh...&nbsp; Please...� I moaned.&nbsp; Like a rasp, the rope scraped through my slit.

Back and forth, back and forth.&nbsp; Like they were sawing into my slit.&nbsp; My arms still around Rafiq&#8217;s neck, I held out for as long I could.&nbsp; But finally the grating was intolerable; I thought they would scrape me raw.

�No more.&nbsp; No more,� I cried clenching the rope to arrest their action.

�That doesn&#8217;t turn you on?� asked Rafiq.

�Oh-my-god, no.&nbsp; You&#8217;re hurting me.�

�How about if we try it more gently?&nbsp; See how it feels.�

As they eased their upward pull, I allowed them to draw the rope back and forth through my crotch, while I guided it with my hands.

�I don&#8217;t like it at all.&nbsp; Not after how rough you already were with it.�

�Here, then lick your juices off this thing,� said the Skipper, taking the rope and holding it to my mouth.

I glanced at Ivy, April, and James.&nbsp; All were watching me.&nbsp; �No,� I said.&nbsp; �I only volunteered to be whipped.&nbsp; Not to be sexually humiliated.�

�No problem.&nbsp; I&#8217;m ready to give you the whipping that you want,� said Rafiq.

�Plus a hundred or so extra strokes for being sassy,� added the Skipper.

�Oh no.�&nbsp; It sounded like I was in for a lengthy whipping.&nbsp; Well, at least it was not too nasty a whip.&nbsp; Yes, it definitely stung, but I felt I could handle it &#8211; on the butt, on the legs, or on the back.&nbsp; But I didn&#8217;t much want to get it on the front ...or between the legs.

Rafiq took up the whip and stepped back.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Skipper returned to Ivy.

�Hands back on your head,� the Skipper said to her.&nbsp; Ivy obeyed.&nbsp; Standing again behind her, he started playing with her breasts with one hand.&nbsp; Although she kept her knees together, his other hand went to her crotch She grimaced and squirmed a bit, but did not resist.

Then I looked at Rafiq.&nbsp; He was holding the whip, eyeing my breasts.&nbsp; I felt vulnerable.&nbsp; But I kept my hands at my sides.

Rafiq said to me,�Turn around and bend over.&nbsp; Hold onto the bulkhead, arms straight forward.�&nbsp; I was relieved that he wasn&#8217;t going to whip me on the front.

Swish...thack!&nbsp; The whip snapped across my butt.&nbsp; Swish...thack!&nbsp; Again.&nbsp; And then again.&nbsp; And again.&nbsp; Breathing hard, I held my position.

He got up a good rhythm on me.&nbsp; Hard strokes, one after another across my butt and thighs.&nbsp; I voiced a loud gasp with every stroke; it&#8217;s more satisfying to both of us that way.&nbsp; Still, I wasn&#8217;t exaggerating; the whip stung.

How long this went on, I&#8217;m not really sure.&nbsp; The rhythm was hypnotic.&nbsp; But it must have been many dozens of strokes. 

Finally he paused.&nbsp; He passed his hand over my butt and then down my thighs.&nbsp; Then he said, �Spread your legs more.�

I looked back at him, trying to gage his intent.&nbsp; I had no wish to be whipped on the pussy.&nbsp; But I obeyed, moving my feet somewhat apart, but only to the width of my shoulders.

Then he lashed the whip across my rear end again several times.&nbsp; I felt more vulnerable with legs apart.

�Arch your back down more.&nbsp; Get your butt up there. ...That&#8217;s better.�

He cracked the whip on my butt a few more times.&nbsp; Then lashed me further down, wrapping it to the inside of the thigh.&nbsp; �Ow.�&nbsp; Too close for comfort.&nbsp; Then again.&nbsp; �Ooh!�&nbsp; And again, and again, and again, high on the inside of the thigh.&nbsp; �Ah!&nbsp; Please be careful.&nbsp; Do you know where you&#8217;re almost hitting me?�&nbsp; I was squirming.

Rafiq paused and passed his fingers over my pussy.&nbsp; Then he slid his finger into my cleft, probing into my vagina.&nbsp; �Rafiq!�&nbsp; I brought my hand back fend him off.&nbsp; I didn&#8217;t want him sticking his fingers inside me out here in front of everybody.

Saying, �Just the whip, that&#8217;s all you want,� he left off with his fingers, and took a step back.&nbsp; I resumed my position, hands forward on the bulkhead.

From the sound of the swish, it didn&#8217;t sound like a hard stroke coming, but... �Ooh!�&nbsp; He stung me right on the pussy.&nbsp; Then another, harder.&nbsp; I yelped.&nbsp; And another, hard.&nbsp; �Ow-ow-ow!&nbsp; Please no.�&nbsp; Writhing, I brought my legs together.

�Legs wide apart.&nbsp; Take your whipping.�

�Oh please, not too hard.�&nbsp; I crept my legs apart, nursing my pussy with one hand.&nbsp; Resuming my position with both hands on the bulkhead, I held my breath, waiting.

Swish...thack!&nbsp;&nbsp; �OOOH!�&nbsp; He stung me on the pussy again.&nbsp; Swish...thack!&nbsp; �AHHH!�&nbsp; Swish...thack!&nbsp; �AHHH!&nbsp; No...&nbsp; Please no.�

Skipper rejoined, �Yeah, whip that pussy.&nbsp; Sting her clit.�

Rafiq continued snapping it on my pussy again and again.&nbsp; I cried out with each stroke.&nbsp; Finally, after a particularly wickedly aimed cut, I let out a screech and broke my position.&nbsp; Turning half way toward him I dropped to the deck and sat on my heels, nursing my pussy.

�Oh, please.&nbsp; That hurts so much.�&nbsp; Then glancing at the Skipper and Ivy, I saw that Ivy&#8217;s face was contorted with pain.&nbsp; Then I saw that the clips were fastened to her pussy.&nbsp; It looked like both of them were biting into the clit.&nbsp; Still, however, she maintained her hands behind her head.

I wondered which one of us was hurting worse.&nbsp; I though it must be me because she could maintain her position in silence, and I could not.&nbsp; But there was no way to know.&nbsp; Maybe she is just stronger than me.

Not wanting to seem pitifully weak, I said, �Can&#8217;t you just whip me in a normal way?&nbsp; Anywhere else, but not down there.�

�Okay, how about on the tits now?�

�Oh please.&nbsp; Not there either.&nbsp; Not with that whip.�&nbsp; I quickly got up and resumed my position, bent over arms straight forward, holding the bulkhead, but keeping my legs closer together.&nbsp; I arched my back to present him with as much encouragement as possible to lash me on the butt.

He took up the invitation and cracked the whip really hard across my butt.&nbsp; Then again.&nbsp; And again.&nbsp; He snapped another dozen strokes across my butt and thighs, so hard I cried out with every one.

He finally paused, and clasping the thong against the crop handle, began stroking the crop back and forth on my breasts.&nbsp; �Those tits of yours need a really good whipping, don&#8217;t they?�

I squirmed, realizing that bent over with arched back, arms straight forward, my breasts were offering encouragement for harassment.

�It&#8217;s the softness that makes them so good to whip.�&nbsp; He tapped at my breast, jiggling it.&nbsp; �Now straighten up and face me.�

I stood and turned to face him, crossing my arms over my breasts.

�Pretending to be modest?� chided Rafiq.&nbsp; �Hands behind your head.�&nbsp;&nbsp; 

�Oh please don&#8217;t whip me on the front.�

After eyeing me for a moment, Rafiq set down the whip and took up the cane.&nbsp; A wave of anxiety swept over me.&nbsp; I didn&#8217;t want anybody to even touch my breasts with that.

Slowing he drew it back.&nbsp; Whoosh-thackkkk!&nbsp;&nbsp; Hard across the front of my thighs. �Ooooh!�&nbsp; That really stung.&nbsp; ...Whoosh-thackkkk!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ...Whoosh-thackkkk!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ...Whoosh-thackkkk!&nbsp; Like fire across my thighs, then across my hips, then across my stomach.&nbsp; �Ow, ow, ow!&nbsp; Shit, that&#8217;s too hard!&nbsp; You&#8217;re really hurting me.�

He snapped it twice more across my stomach so hard, then twice across my arms held protectively across my breasts.&nbsp; What had I done to deserve being beaten like this?

�Are you going to put your hands behind your head?�

�Oh-my-god no.&nbsp; If you hit me like that on the breasts, I&#8217;ll just die.�

He lowered the cane and passed his hand over the welts he had raised across my stomach.&nbsp; I took this opportunity also to rub the stinging welts, while keeping my breasts covered with one arm.

�So you don&#8217;t want me to put the cane to your tits.&nbsp; You&#8217;d rather get it with the whip.�

�I&#8217;d rather not get it at all on the... tits.&nbsp; Besides, haven&#8217;t I been punished enough?&nbsp; And Ivy too?�

�Think so?&nbsp; Well, maybe we should see how other people feel.&nbsp; Everyone who thinks Jenny&#8217;s had enough say &#8216;aye&#8217;.�

�Aye!� Ivy, April, and I called out in unison.&nbsp; Rafiq, James, and the Skipper were silent.

�Sorry, Jenny.&nbsp; Tie vote.&nbsp; Not a majority.&nbsp; I guess we stick with the status quo.&nbsp; You&#8217;ve got more strokes coming.&nbsp;&nbsp; ...Now, on your knees.�

I frowned at him for several moments, then reluctantly knelt before him.

�Stable posture, knees apart.�

I looked up at his face to try to read his intentions.&nbsp; It wasn&#8217;t clear what he was up to.&nbsp; But since he was standing to my right, there seemed no immediately threat of him swatting me on the pussy.&nbsp; I crept my knees apart, my eyes never leaving his.

�Hands behind head.�&nbsp; He tapped the cane on my arms, still protectively crossed over my chest.&nbsp; �Now,� he added forcefully, as I hesitated.

�Rafiq...� I whined.&nbsp; �That isn&#8217;t right.�

�Heyyy...&nbsp; What&#8217;s the problem?&nbsp; Lack of trust?�&nbsp; He gave me a sly smile as he slid the cane up and down my stomach.

I searched his face.&nbsp; I remembered that he had intervened to stop Ivy from caning my breasts.&nbsp; I decided to acquiesce.&nbsp; I slowly raised my arms and placed my hands behind my head.&nbsp; Taking a deep breath, I closed my eyes, straightened and thrust out my chest, elbows back, head turned away, offering myself up completely.

He slid the cane up and down my breasts.&nbsp; I tried not to react to it as he bumped it over my nipples.&nbsp; Of course they were really stiff.&nbsp; I wondered if people thought I was erotically stimulated at the prospect of being caned on the breasts.

He continued harrying my nipples with the cane.&nbsp; And hands beyond head, I continued kneeling, offering my breasts to be beaten, but trusting that they would not be.

Finally he took hold of my nipple, tugged sharply upward, and gave the base of my breast a smart rap with the cane.&nbsp; I let out a gasp, perhaps more startled at having my nipple so ill-used than being rapped on the softness of the breast.

He continued yanking on my nipple, and again rapped on my breast with the cane.&nbsp; Then again.&nbsp; And again.&nbsp; And several more times.&nbsp; I was breathing rapidly, but I held my position.

Relenting, he finally released my nipple.&nbsp; I exhaled in relief.&nbsp; For the briefest moment I brought my hand down to touch my breast, but quickly returned it behind my head.

Rafiq then pinched hold of the other nipple, yanked upward, and rapped sharply on the lower part of my breast.&nbsp; He continued with what seemed like a dozen raps, as I grimaced and panted and squirmed.

Finally he released my nipple.&nbsp; I sat back on my heels, cradling my breasts.&nbsp; �You just beat me on the tits.�&nbsp; ...That was a bit of an exaggeration.

�Did that really hurt?� asked Rafiq.&nbsp; He seemed skeptical.

Ignoring the question, I pouted, �You were yanking on my nipples like they&#8217;re some kind of knobs for holding onto me.�

The Skipper chimed in, �Yeah.&nbsp; Grip those knobs and shake her titties.�

I held my arms tightly across my breasts.&nbsp; I didn&#8217;t want anybody shaking me by the nipples.&nbsp; I glanced around.&nbsp; Skipper had taken the clips off Ivy&#8217;s clit and was reapplying them to her nipples.&nbsp; She had this look of resignation.

Meanwhile, James, standing behind April, had lifted her bikini top above her breasts.&nbsp; He had taken hold of her nipples and was lightly swaying her jugs back and forth.&nbsp; April was biting her lip.&nbsp; She held her hands close beside her breasts, ready to arrest his action, but she allowed him to continue.

Was I disturbed that all the guys were now besetting all the girls?&nbsp; No, at least now I wasn&#8217;t the only one on the receiving end.&nbsp;&nbsp; ...And yet, it almost felt like something was missing for my ordeal not to be the center of everyone&#8217;s attention.

�Arch yourself backwards, like in the camel posture.�&nbsp; Rafiq was referring to the yoga posture ushtra-asana, one of the postures I had taught him over the last couple days.&nbsp; You begin while sitting on your heels, shins on the floor, just as I was then sitting.&nbsp; Clasping your ankles, you lift your butt off your heels, and thrust your hips upward and forward, arching your back as far as possible and tilting the head back. In that kind of backward arching posture, chest thrust upwards, crotch thrust forward, you&#8217;d be extremely vulnerable confronting a whip or cane.

Not acceding to his command, I whined, �Rafiq.&nbsp; Not with the cane.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t want you to keep threatening to cane me on the front.�

�Not the cane?&nbsp; You&#8217;d rather have the whip.&nbsp; All right, I&#8217;ll give you the whip.&nbsp; Just lean back and I&#8217;ll give it to you good.�

Skipper chimed in, �Yeah, put the the whip to her girl flesh.&nbsp; Sting those nipples good.�

�Rafiq, oh please...�

�Come on, Jenny.&nbsp; You need a challenge.�

I glanced around.&nbsp; Skipper was drumming the clips on Ivy&#8217;s nipples up and down.&nbsp; The jiggling of her breasts really arrested my gaze.&nbsp; Ivy&#8217;s eyes were squinched such, her mouth open, but she held her posture in silence, hands behind head.

I looked at April.&nbsp; From behind, James was squeezing his fingers into her fat jugs as though kneading dough.&nbsp; April was still biting her lip, but her expression was receptive.

Could I be less brave than Ivy and April?&nbsp; I glanced up at Rafiq.&nbsp; Without another word, I took hold of my ankles, thrust my hips up and forward, and arched back to the ushtra-asana.

Rafiq fondled my upthrust breasts, pressing his thumbs into my nipples, making circular motions.&nbsp; It was more forceful than I like having my breasts handled, but I held my position, breathing shallowly.&nbsp; Better to have him playing with my breasts than whipping them.

Finally his hand left my breasts and passed up and down my ribs for a time, then onto my stomach.&nbsp; His finger poked hard into my belly button.&nbsp; It pressed this way and that, as if searching for a passage inward.&nbsp; Finally, as if giving up that my belly button lead anywhere, his fingers moved lower.&nbsp; I was starting to tire; this posture is not one that anybody holds indefinitely.

His fingers passed over my clit, going around and around in a circular motion.&nbsp; But this position was getting too uncomfortable for me to be able to get turned on.&nbsp; His finger then slid down my cleft.&nbsp; The next thing I knew he was sticking it up my tunnel.&nbsp; Whoa!&nbsp; That was entirely enough.

I dropped out of that posture, returning to sitting on my heels.&nbsp; His stupid hand, with its inserted finger, followed me down.&nbsp; I grabbed his arm and pushed it away.&nbsp; �Rafiq!&nbsp; Quit it!�

I glanced around, distressed at being humiliated like this before an audience.&nbsp; But April and James were taking no notice of me.&nbsp; James, still standing behind April, had wrapped the sisal rope around her body several times, right across her breasts.&nbsp; April is so stacked, it was digging deeply into the flesh of her breasts.&nbsp; It was like she was wearing a special punishment bra.&nbsp; I could hardly take my eyes off her.&nbsp; I had never imagined April submitting to such treatment.

I looked over at Ivy.&nbsp; Her eyes were closed.&nbsp; She had her own problems with the Skipper pulling on the chain to the clips on her tormented nipples.&nbsp; Only the Skipper, still behind Ivy, had his eyes on me.&nbsp; Seeing that he had my attention, he pointed at me, made a gesture of slapping his cheek, and then pointed at Rafiq, indicating that I should slap Rafiq for publicly finger-fucking me.

I considered that for only a split second before realizing that the Skipper just wanted to give Rafiq a reason to whip me even more and even harder.&nbsp; Unsure that I could handle what was already coming, I was not going to invite more.

�Back into position,� ordered Rafiq.

�That&#8217;s too tiring.&nbsp; Nobody holds that position very long.�&nbsp; Instead, remaining seated on my heals, I leaned back, my hands on the deck behind me.&nbsp; Although my knees were still apart, my pussy seemed less vulnerable in this position, but it still felt like I was acquiescing to getting my breasts whipped.

I looked up at him.&nbsp; His eyes were on my body.&nbsp; Was he seeing me, or just some sex object?

Biting my lip, I squinched my eyes shut and leaned my head back.&nbsp; I didn&#8217;t want to see it coming.&nbsp; Then I heard the hiss of the whip slicing air.&nbsp; With a loud &#8216;thack&#8217; it stung me across the ribs.

Then again, this time across the stomach.&nbsp; Then another.&nbsp; Again and again, gradually moving up my ribs.&nbsp; Each with that hissing swish, that loud thack, that biting sting.&nbsp; I punctuated each with a gasp.

Holding my position, I kept my eyes closed, head tilted back and away.&nbsp; Sound and sting, that was my world now.&nbsp; Sound and sting, but mostly sting.

The whip strokes were moving closer and closer to my chest.&nbsp; I knew what was coming.&nbsp; I knew he would never be satisfied until he had whipped me on the breasts.&nbsp; All right.&nbsp; I would see how much I could take.&nbsp; I held my position, arms back leaning on the deck, chest thrust out, inviting the whip.

Swish...thack.&nbsp; He stung me on the base of the breast.&nbsp; Then again, and again.&nbsp; I held on, each time hoping it wouldn&#8217;t get me across the nipples.

Swish...thack!.&nbsp; �OOOH!�&nbsp; That one caught me on the left nipple.&nbsp; It really hurt.&nbsp; Swish...thack!&nbsp; �AHHH!�&nbsp; Hard on the right nipple.

Then two more lightning strikes to the nipples.&nbsp; My cries had turned to shrieks.&nbsp; My nipples were on fire.&nbsp; How much more could I take?

Swish...thack, again stinging my nipples.&nbsp; �Ow-ow-ow!�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ...And still again, Swish...thack.&nbsp; �EEEEE...�&nbsp; I broke my position, taking my breasts in my hands, trying to rub out the sting.&nbsp; �My tits.&nbsp; My tits...�

�Yeah, your tits.&nbsp; Your tits are so good.&nbsp; Rub them up.�

He made it sound like I was trying to turn people on by playing with my breasts.&nbsp; I glanced around.&nbsp; All eyes were on me.&nbsp;&nbsp; ...But what did it matter what they thought.&nbsp; Right now my nipples were on fire.

Swish...thack.&nbsp; He laid a stroke across the front of the thighs.&nbsp; �Back into position.&nbsp; I&#8217;ll spare your breasts for now,� he said.

Slowly I brought my hands back onto the deck behind me, and leaned back, thighs apart, offering everything in front to the whip, trusting that he would give my breasts a respite.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

Swish...thack!&nbsp; �Ooh.�&nbsp; It was to the inside of the thigh, but so close to the pussy.&nbsp; At least in this position my labia would not be so open.

Swish...thack!&nbsp; �Ooooh!�&nbsp; That time he stung my pussy lips.&nbsp; Swish...thack!&nbsp; �Ow!&nbsp; Please...�&nbsp; Another one right in the pussy.&nbsp; My legs lurched but I resisted the urge to bring them together.&nbsp; Could I take the whipping he wanted to give me?

Again on the pussy.&nbsp; Thack!&nbsp; �AHHH!�&nbsp;&nbsp; And then again.&nbsp; �OOOOH!�&nbsp; Despite my efforts to accept my whipping, my legs were inching closer together.&nbsp; Thack!&nbsp; �EEEEEE!�&nbsp; That one stung my clit so bad.

I broke my position, bringing my thighs together and hands forward to my crotch.&nbsp; My fingers told me that my clit was still intact, something I would not have guessed from the stinging pain emanating from it.

Swish...thack.&nbsp;&nbsp; �Ahhhhh!�&nbsp; Denied access to my pussy, he now laid a hard stroke across the breasts.&nbsp; I brought one arm up to protect myself.&nbsp; He aimed several more strokes across my chest, while I protected my breasts with one hand and forearm, while nursing my pussy with the other hand.

But now he tugged my hand away and forced his hand between my thighs, first pressing on my sore clit and then further below.&nbsp; �You&#8217;re moist.&nbsp; That&#8217;s good.&nbsp; Glad you&#8217;re enjoying this.&nbsp; Now let&#8217;s lay you on the table here and finish you off.&nbsp; Whip you till you cum.�

�Oh please don&#8217;t whip me anymore,� I replied.&nbsp; But I was so taken aback by the idea that I would be enjoying such punishment that my words came out sounding feeble and unconvincing, 

�Come on.&nbsp; On the table with you,� insisted Rafiq.&nbsp; �This is the whipping you need and want.�

Acquiescing, I got up off the deck and approached the table extending out of the bulkhead.&nbsp; I laid my body on it, chest down, feet remaining on the deck.&nbsp; I kept my legs together &#8211; I didn&#8217;t want any more lashes on the pussy.

He set aside the whip and took up the cane again.&nbsp; Then he swatted me on the butt.&nbsp; �OW!�&nbsp; Then a really hard, stinging stroke to the back of the thighs.&nbsp; �OOOH!�

He laid about a dozen more strokes across my butt and the backs of my thighs.&nbsp; I cried out with each one.&nbsp; How I hate the cane.&nbsp; He was hitting so hard.&nbsp; But such a confusion of sensations.&nbsp; Why was I sexually aroused?&nbsp; Would I be able to come off like this?

Pausing the cane strokes and feeling my bottom with his hand, Rafiq said, �Actually, I intended that you lay on your back.&nbsp; Putting the cane to your butt is good, but I really love laying the whip on your front.�

I knew it was no use arguing.&nbsp; The sensuality of a girl&#8217;s front makes it a prime target.&nbsp; But for me at least it would mean trading that villainous cane for the not quite so dreadful whip.&nbsp; Still, I knew he would aim for the breasts.&nbsp; But I wanted to be brave enough to accept whipping he wanted to give me.

Slowly I turned myself over, watching him as he set aside the cane and took up the whip.&nbsp; The small of my back on the edge of the table, my feet remained on the floor.&nbsp; Arched back like this, it seemed like the ultimate surrender of my body to him.&nbsp; Now casting my arms beyond my head, I completed a total surrender to his whims, trusting that he would not bring me to harm.

Laying his hand on my ribs, he began feeling up my body.&nbsp; His hand passed slowly and sensuously over my stomach, again over my ribs, and onto my breasts.&nbsp; Eyes closed, I arched to meet his caress.

�Here, take this in your mouth.�&nbsp; His hard penis bumped my cheek.

Turned my head to him, I took it into my mouth, sucking and working it with my tongue.&nbsp; If I could get him to come off, my punishment would finally end.&nbsp; ...But still, I wanted to be able to come off too.

I continued sucking as his fingers swirled circles around my nipples.&nbsp; Yet this was strange &#8211; an ordinary caress seemed almost anticlimactic.&nbsp; Was my body now harmonized only to hard treatment?

The Skipper&#8217;s voice now intruded.&nbsp; �Ivy, your task is to service Jenny with your mouth.&nbsp; I want you to lick her off good.�

I stopped sucking, letting Rafiq&#8217;s penis come away from my mouth.&nbsp; I had to see what was going to happen.&nbsp; Ivy said nothing, but kneeling between my legs, she brought her mouth to my crotch and lightly licked the labia.&nbsp; I knew immediately that despite the travail of our situation &#8211; she was still suffering those nipple-pinching clips &#8211; she would approach her task with finesse.

�Ivy,� said the Skipper.&nbsp; �While you&#8217;re pleasuring Jenny, I think you need your own stimulation.&nbsp; Let me strap this butterfly vibrator on you.�

Don&#8217;t ask me why the Skipper had a butterfly vibrator.&nbsp; I have no idea.

As Ivy continued tonguing me, I tried to watch as the Skipper put the butterfly vibrator on her.&nbsp; But Rafiq imposed upon me.&nbsp; Flicking the whip across my ribs, he pressed his penis back into my face.&nbsp; I again took it into my mouth and worked it with my tongue.&nbsp; He continued flicking the whip lightly on the far side of my ribs.

I thought he was being gentle because I was giving him such a good blow job.&nbsp; ...But then I realized that to give him a blow job, he had to stay too close to hit me hard.

This went on for a little while until the Skipper, now apparently done with Ivy, interjected, �Gimme that whip.&nbsp; You can&#8217;t get her from that position.�

Uh-oh.&nbsp; Now I was in for it. .&nbsp; The only kind of whipping I could expect from the Skipper was a hard one.&nbsp; As he yielded the whip to the Skipper, I started sucking feverishly on Rafiq&#8217;s penis.&nbsp; I had to get him to come off if this ordeal was ever going to end.

Swish...thack!&nbsp; The Skipper laid a hard stroke across my ribs.&nbsp; Swish...thackk!&nbsp; On the base of the breast.&nbsp; I gave a jolt but continued sucking.

Swish...thackk!&nbsp; �Umph!�&nbsp; He stung me hard on the nipple.&nbsp; Wincing with the pain, I continued my task.

Swish...thackk!&nbsp; Right on the other nipple, hard.&nbsp; I couldn&#8217;t help letting out a gasp.

�Yeah.&nbsp; Did you feel that?� asked the Skipper.&nbsp; �A good one, huh?&nbsp; Put the sting to those nipples of yours.�&nbsp; He stroked my breast with his hand, but then took hold of the nipple and gave it a sharp pinch.

Then he stepped back and raised the whip.&nbsp; Swish...thackk!&nbsp; Back on the first nipple again.&nbsp; �Ahhhhh!�&nbsp; I let out a cry, turned away from Rafiq&#8217;s penis, and brought my arm down to protect myself.

�April.&nbsp; You need to hold Jenny&#8217;s arms,� said Skipper.&nbsp; �Hold her down good.�

April stepped over and I surrendered my arms to her.&nbsp; James had released her breasts from the tightly bound rope but the indentation lines were apparent, leading right across her nipples.&nbsp; Her big jugs hung over my face as she bent over me.&nbsp; James was right behind her, now squeezing her breasts, now slapping her breasts, jiggling them crazily.&nbsp; It occurred to me that he might have entered her from behind, but I couldn&#8217;t tell.

Rafiq then thrust his penis in my face and I took it into my mouth, working it with my tongue.&nbsp; Skipper then gave me a couple of whip strokes across the ribs.&nbsp; But then it was back on the breasts, one hard stroke after another.

I continued sucking on Rafiq&#8217;s penis while the Skipper rained whip stroke after whip stroke onto my breasts.&nbsp; Above the nipples, below the nipples, but especially right on the nipples, so hard.&nbsp; With each stroke I wrenched.&nbsp; Yet I continued sucking.&nbsp; I had to finish this job.

And through all this torment, Ivy was tonguing my clit, forcing me toward sexual arousal.&nbsp; I wanted that pleasure.&nbsp; But the Skipper kept stinging my nipples so bad.&nbsp; My tits were on fire.

I wanted it to stop.&nbsp; I wanted it to go on.&nbsp; I didn&#8217;t know what I wanted.

Yet I saw that it didn&#8217;t matter what I wanted.&nbsp; Here was a reality to be experienced, not evaluated.&nbsp;&nbsp; April holding my arms, her big jugs flopping above my face as James slapped them back and forth.&nbsp; Rafiq&#8217;s big hard penis in my mouth; me doing my utmost to pleasure him.&nbsp; Skipper&#8217;s hard whip strokes scorching my breasts, my nipples now burning like red-hot coals.&nbsp; And Ivy&#8217;s wet tongue on my clit, impelling me onward toward orgasm.

And at the center of the whole thing was me, feeling like a Siren, irresistibly drawing these people into delirious sexual mayhem.&nbsp; For that, it seemed right that I should be the one to suffer the most.&nbsp; Hard though they used me, it now felt that I was controlling them, not them controlling me.

�You&#8217;re so good.&nbsp; So good,� moaned Rafiq.&nbsp; And with that his penis began pulsing gooey oil-of-life into my mouth.&nbsp; Grunting bullishly he pressed into my face.

Encircled by all this sexual madness, I knew I could not contain my own.&nbsp; My sucking mouth, my stinging breasts, my tingling pussy.

Swish...thackk!&nbsp; The Skipper laid the whip hard, again right across both nipples.&nbsp; Waves of orgasmic energy reverberated through my body, like an sonic aura borealis undulating through my consciousness.

Opposites converged, splintered, converged again, and splintered again.&nbsp;&nbsp; ...Pain. Pleasure.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ...Bitter. Sweet.&nbsp;&nbsp; ...Male. Female.&nbsp;&nbsp; ...Yin. Yang.&nbsp;&nbsp; ...Death. Birth.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ...Dissolution. Unity.&nbsp;&nbsp; ...Matter. Antimatter, colliding within my body, mind.

Intolerable pleasure.&nbsp; Exquisite pain.&nbsp; Music beyond the bounds of rhythm or melody played though my body.&nbsp; Colors beyond the limits of the spectrum glimmered though my mind.

My body underwent the entire universe of sensation suffered or savored since the dawn of time.&nbsp; I was a black hole sucking in the galaxy of sexual passion of all who surrounded me.&nbsp; Their desire to act upon me fed my craving to be acted upon.&nbsp; Their action.&nbsp; My satisfaction.











Chapter 5.&nbsp; The Not So Dangerous Game

Another day had passed.&nbsp; It was late afternoon.&nbsp; James and April were at watch on deck.&nbsp; Ivy, Skipper, Rafiq, and I were below playing cards ...and drinking.&nbsp; Rafiq had made me a daiquiri.&nbsp; It tasted pretty good.&nbsp; The alcohol didn&#8217;t taste too strong, but I could definitely feel it.

The card game was Hearts.&nbsp; Every heart you get stuck with counts one point against you.&nbsp; And getting stuck with the Queen of Spades counts thirteen points against you.&nbsp; At one stage in the game, Ivy was winning.&nbsp; I had the opportunity to drop the Queen of Spades on Rafiq but I held off.&nbsp; A moment later I dropped the Queen of Spades on Ivy.

�You dumped that on me on purpose,� she said.&nbsp; �You made sure I got it instead of Rafiq.�

�Oh well.&nbsp; It&#8217;s nothing to get mad about,� I replied.

�I don&#8217;t get mad; I get even.�&nbsp; Ivy was getting over-loud.&nbsp; She was on her third daiquiri.

After the next hand, the game ended, with Rafiq winning.&nbsp; At this point Ivy said, �Skipper, did you notice that Jenny is drinking alcohol.&nbsp; She&#8217;s underage.&nbsp; I think its your duty to discipline her for that.�

�Underage?&nbsp; Jenny&#8217;s eighteen.�&nbsp; Looking at me, he asked, �Aren&#8217;t you?�

But Ivy said, �Twenty-one is the age for drinking, not eighteen.&nbsp; You need to discipline her for that.�

�Oh...&nbsp; Well, yeah.&nbsp; I guess twenty-one is the age in the U.S.&nbsp; But so what?&nbsp; Jenny drinks so little.&nbsp; She hasn&#8217;t even finished that one glass.&nbsp; Why are you making a scene about this?�

�Even so, you&#8217;re the captain.&nbsp; You need to discipline her for that.�

�For having a few sips of alcohol?&nbsp; That&#8217;s really lame.&nbsp; I&#8217;d rather punish her for no reason than for a stupid reason like that.&nbsp; ...Yeah, just punish her for being a good-looking girl.&nbsp; What do you think, Rock?�

�Well...� said Rafiq.

�But that isn&#8217;t fair, punishing me for no reason.�

�Technicalities,� answered the Skipper.&nbsp; �Open your top.&nbsp; Let&#8217;s have a look at those titties.&nbsp; What kind of punishment should we visit on your soft mounds today?�

Crossing my arms over my chest, I said, �No, I&#8217;m not going to be punished.&nbsp; Ivy started this whole thing.&nbsp; Punish her instead.�

�Well, we could punish both of you.&nbsp; What do you think we should do, Rock?�

�Rafiq!�&nbsp; I looked at him with consternation.&nbsp; Why wasn&#8217;t he supporting me on this?

�Oh...&nbsp; Well, maybe not,� said Rafiq.&nbsp; �At the moment, it doesn&#8217;t seem that Jenny&#8217;s into it.&nbsp; And certainly this underage thing is totally silly.&nbsp; Jenny is much more temperate than Ivy.&nbsp; I can tell you a story about Ivy&#8217;s drinking.�

�What do you mean?&nbsp; What story?� asked Ivy.&nbsp; She set down her drink.

�Last December.&nbsp; When we visited Tortola.�

�Oh-my-god.&nbsp; Not that,� said Ivy.

�Yeah.&nbsp; When we went to that place with the steel band, and you got so drunk that you threw up on somebody&#8217;s foot.�

�It was a nice vacation on a nice island, and you would pick out the one negative thing to recall,� replied Ivy.

�Oh come on, Ivy, it&#8217;s not that negative.&nbsp; It&#8217;s just funny.&nbsp; And I agree it was a nice vacation.�

Ivy then started talking about Tortola, one of the British Virgin Islands.&nbsp; At some point Skipper moved the topic to a place called Cayo Peligro, saying it was a small Venezuelan island where he had worked as a young man.&nbsp; He wanted to tell us about his experience there.

�General factotum.&nbsp; That was my job,� he said.&nbsp; �My boss owned the island.�

�Factotum?&nbsp; Is that like a valet or something?� I asked.

Skipper scowled at me.&nbsp; �Aide.�

�Oh.&nbsp; Sorry.�&nbsp; I kept quiet after that.

�Anyway, considering that he owned the whole thing, this was a nice-sized little island.&nbsp; My boss, his name was Zarkov, said it was 1000 meters long and maybe 150 meters wide.&nbsp; His chateau was of stone ...suggestive of a castle, but not really.

�Yeah, this guy Zarkov, he loved his island.&nbsp; Called it his fiefdom.&nbsp; Only problem is that I&#8217;m not sure the tropical climate agreed with him.&nbsp; By his own admission, he had the worst case of jock rot ever known to man or beast.&nbsp; All told, he must have spent two or three hours a day scratching his balls.

�Anyway, Zarkov was a sportsman of sorts.&nbsp; He liked to hunt ...people.&nbsp; Girls specifically.&nbsp; Once he brought couple local mainland girls over to his island.&nbsp; They were sisters, about you girls&#8217; ages.&nbsp; Nice looking.&nbsp; Dark hair, dark eyes, like most of the locals.&nbsp; Slender too.

�So anyway, he paid these girls to serve as quarry.&nbsp; If he can&#8217;t catch them in one hour, then they go home with something close to a couple hundred bucks each ...can&#8217;t remember how many bolivars it was.&nbsp; Anyway, at that time it was good pay.&nbsp; If he catches them, then they get paid just the same, but only after they undergo some stiff punishment.

�Zarkov told them they needed to change clothes first.&nbsp; He didn&#8217;t want them going back home with their clothes all messed up.&nbsp; People might ask questions.&nbsp; So he had bought these short skirts for them to wear during the hunt, but first he had me rip them up to make them real ragged.&nbsp; Wearing their tatters, it was to make them look like castaways turned to nature girls or something.&nbsp; Anyway, the girls agreed, and so turning away from us, they changed into these ripped-up skirts.

�Then he starts telling them that they have to take off their blouses so that none of their clothes get messed up during the chase.&nbsp; So the younger sister unbuttons her blouse.&nbsp; The older one starts upbraiding her.&nbsp; The younger one doesn&#8217;t take well to her sister&#8217;s reprimand, and so she just strips off her blouse and stands bare breasted before us.

�Well, there are some more words exchanged, but faced with the prospect of her younger sister getting paid nicely to participate in this hunt, and she not, the older sister falls into line and takes her blouse off too.&nbsp; So the two sisters stand before us in just their ragged skirts and their sneakers, the older sister with her arms across her chest, pouting, and the younger sister bare breasted with her arms at her sides, acting like this is the most natural thing in the world for her.

�So my boss, to make sure they performed their best during the hunt, wanted to give them a taste of the consequences for letting him catch them.&nbsp; So before sending them on their way, he cut a nice switch from a nearby bush, trimmed it, and then he lifted the younger sister&#8217;s skirt just a bit, and gave her several hard swats on the back of her thighs.&nbsp; She was a pretty tough girl; gasped a bit with each stroke, but otherwise kept quiet.

�Then he did the same with the older sister.&nbsp; But she was not so receptive to the switch &#8211; let out a squeal with each stroke.

�So he warns them, &#8216;just don&#8217;t let us catch you, cause if you do, one of you will get a switching between the legs, and the other one on the tits, hard as we can.&#8217;&nbsp; And he takes hold of the younger sister&#8217;s tit, and gives it a few light taps with the switch.

�So he sends them on their way, and off they run, tits bouncing free.�

Rafiq interrupted, �You know, Skipper, fact or fiction, your story may have its charm.&nbsp; But I&#8217;m wondering if it&#8217;s entirely appropriate for mixed company.�

Ivy scoffed, �Do you think our ears are too delicate for Skipper&#8217;s ribald stories.&nbsp; ...I&#8217;m betting Jenny&#8217;s really turned on.&nbsp; She wishes she were one of the sisters.�

�I do not,� I replied.&nbsp; �Why are you saying that?&nbsp; It&#8217;s really obnoxious.�

�No it isn&#8217;t,� said Ivy.&nbsp; �Well.&nbsp; It wasn&#8217;t meant to be.&nbsp; ...Sorry if you took offense.&nbsp; I&#8217;m forgetting that you&#8217;re in denial.�

�I am not.&nbsp; Why are you insulting me?&nbsp; Are you still mad about that stupid card game?�

�What do I care about that stupid card game?� she replied.&nbsp; �Anything I say now, you&#8217;re the one who&#8217;s getting all pissed off about nothing.&nbsp; And why do you think its so bad to admit you&#8217;d get turned on by being hunted down, captured, and tormented?�

�What do you know about what I think?&nbsp; Why am I even the subject of conversation?&nbsp; I was sitting here quietly, minding my own business, listening to Skipper&#8217;s story...�

�Girls!&nbsp; Girls!&nbsp; Please!� interrupted the Skipper.&nbsp; �What is this shit?&nbsp; I start telling a kinky story, and you both start behaving like you&#8217;ve got to have a whipping too.&nbsp; Well, if that&#8217;s the case...�

�Hey, just cool it for now,� said Rafiq.&nbsp; �I don&#8217;t think Jenny&#8217;s that eager for a whipping.�&nbsp; But then he gave me this inquiring look, as though he wasn&#8217;t sure whether he had said the right thing.

As affirmation, I said, �Yes...&nbsp; I mean no.&nbsp; No whippings, please.&nbsp; Can&#8217;t we just hear the story?�

�Oh yes,� agreed the Skipper.&nbsp; �Now where was I?&nbsp; Oh yeah...&nbsp; So, anyway, we give the girls fifteen minutes head start.&nbsp; The island isn&#8217;t so big that they can actually put fifteen minutes of distance between us, but he wanted to give them time to find good hiding places.

�Then we went after them, Zarkov leading the way.&nbsp; He&#8217;s got the switch; I&#8217;m carrying several sections of rope.&nbsp; The house is on one end of the island, so there is only one direction to go.&nbsp; We stay together.&nbsp; He is the hunter.&nbsp; I&#8217;m only the adjutant.

�Zarkov is meticulous about in his approach to the hunt.&nbsp; He figures the only way he can lose is if he goes beyond their hiding place.&nbsp; If we reach the far end of the island without finding them, then doubling back probably won&#8217;t give us enough time to scour the island again before the hour runs out.

�About three-fourths of the way along the island we glimpse one of the girls in a tree a little ways ahead.&nbsp; She realizes that we&#8217;ve spotted her, jumps down and dashes off into the salt marsh on the lee side of that end of the island.

�Zarkov doesn&#8217;t immediately follow.&nbsp; He says that if we get too hung up on one girl, the other might slip by us, double back, and run out the hour.

�His strategy pays off.&nbsp; Carefully scanning the forest as he moves forward, he spots the other girl in a tree a little ways away.&nbsp; It&#8217;s the younger sister.&nbsp; He sends me up after her.&nbsp; Reaching her, she doesn&#8217;t resist as I bind her wrists in front with the rope.&nbsp; Then I lower her down till her feet almost reach the ground, securing the rope to the tree limb.&nbsp; Although Zarkov has supervised the whole operation from below, most of his attention was directed toward watching the salt marsh, where the older sister disappeared.

�With the younger sister suspended from a bough of the tree, arms over head, we go after the older one.&nbsp; Zarkov enters the marsh where he believes she went in.&nbsp; At first we can track her from the cloudy knee-deep water she left in her wake, but as we go in deeper, it&#8217;s not apparent where she went.

�Zarkov insists that he would have spotted her if she had left the marsh.&nbsp; Slowly we move through the marsh.&nbsp; Time is running out.&nbsp; I tell him that she must be long gone, heading back toward his house.&nbsp; Zarkov silences me with an angry look, and I say no more.

�We come to a stop, and Zarkov is scanning the marsh.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t see anything.&nbsp; But finally he points to a clump of rushes, and we move silently toward it.

�He spots her hiding underwater among the rushes.&nbsp; Really clever girl.&nbsp; She&#8217;s lying on her back completely submerged, breathing through a hollow reed as if it were a snorkel.&nbsp; A really good trick.&nbsp; Raising her, Zarkov congratulates her for her ingenuity.

�He tells me that what he saw was an unnatural movement of the rushes.&nbsp; To keep herself from floating, she had to clasp the rushes from beneath the surface and hold herself under.&nbsp; It was her subtle movement of the rushes that Zarkov detected.&nbsp; I was duly impressed ...with both Zarkov and the girl.

�So anyway, he has me bind her wrists behind her back, and off we go, back to where we had secured the younger sister.&nbsp; She seems relieved by our return and chides us for leaving her out there alone and helpless.&nbsp; But Zarkov reassures her that we were within earshot at all times.

�He offers to ring out the older sister&#8217;s wet skirt.&nbsp; She declines, but he takes it off her anyway.&nbsp; With her wrists tied behind her, she is in no position to resist.&nbsp; Then he has me bind ropes to each of her ankles.&nbsp; Tossing the ropes over different overhanging branches, together we hoist her off the ground, upside down, legs apart.&nbsp; She&#8217;s a bit upset about that, but Zarkov reassures her.�

Rafiq asked, �Her panties are still on, right?&nbsp; And her legs apart.�

�Oh, yeah...�&nbsp; The Skipper hesitated.&nbsp; �Uh... Well, at this point Zarkov cut her panties off with his knife.�&nbsp; Skipper glanced at us around the table, and then said, �This happened a number of years ago, you know, so I have a little trouble remembering all the details.�

Rafiq said, �Hey, you&#8217;re doing great.&nbsp; I shouldn&#8217;t have interrupted.�

Skipper continued, �So anyway, the older sister is hanging upside down, completely naked, legs apart, arms tied behind her back.&nbsp; And then the Skipper takes this little metal box out of his pocket.&nbsp; He opens it and I see that it&#8217;s got a dozen or so map pins in it.&nbsp; You know what map pins are?&nbsp; About the length of a thumb tack, but with a spherical plastic head instead of a flat head.

�And he sticks a few of these little pins in the skin of her breasts.&nbsp; She gasps and winces but takes it fairly well.&nbsp; Then he sticks a pin into her nipple ...into the areola, not the nub of the nipple.&nbsp; But she really lets out a shriek.�

As he was telling this, Skipper&#8217;s eyes were on my breasts.&nbsp; That made me anxious even though I was clothed.&nbsp; Instinctively, I folded my arms over my chest.&nbsp; I glanced at Ivy.&nbsp; She had noticed my reaction.&nbsp; She smiled subtly.

The Skipper continued, �Well, Zarkov had this thing about symmetry.&nbsp; So he couldn&#8217;t have just one pin near the edge of the areola.&nbsp; He&#8217;s got to stick in three more, symmetrically around her nipple.&nbsp; She gave a hell of a shriek with each one.&nbsp; But fortunately for the girl, he doesn&#8217;t feel compelled to stick one down the center.

�But of course, he can&#8217;t be satisfied with pins in just one nipple.&nbsp; The other one gets the same treatment.&nbsp; One pin, two, three, and four.&nbsp; She lets out a shriek with each one.�

At this point the Skipper took his eyes off my chest and looked at my face.&nbsp; Obviously I didn&#8217;t like him staring at my body while he talked about jabbing pins into women&#8217;s nipples.&nbsp; So I must have been frowning at him. For just a moment, he looked slightly abashed.&nbsp; But then he said, �You look a little anxious, Jenny.&nbsp; Are you worried somebody&#8217;s going to do something to your tits?�

Clasping my arms even more tightly across by breasts and twisting my torso slightly away from him, I said, �Now why ever would you think I need to worry about that?�

The Skipper laughed.&nbsp; I smiled just a little.&nbsp; He said, �Maybe I was looking at your body just to help me visualize... I mean remember... what happened.&nbsp; It was a long time ago, you know.&nbsp; And all that liquor I&#8217;ve drunk over the years has softened my brain cells.�

Then Ivy said, �Jenny should take her shirt off to help jog your memory, don&#8217;t you think?�

I said to her, �I don&#8217;t want to take my shirt off.&nbsp; Why don&#8217;t you take your top off instead?�

She replied, �I&#8217;ll take mine off and then you take yours off.�

Damn!&nbsp; I was feeling trapped.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t like being made to acknowledge how modest I am.&nbsp; It makes me feel like I have immature hangups about my body.

Then Rafiq said, �We can all take our shirts off.&nbsp; Then everyone will be even.�

What an annoying thing for him to say.&nbsp; Conventions and attitudes being what they are, surely he cannot actually believe it&#8217;s �even� if guys and girls both take their shirts off.

And surely he realized I did not want to take mine off.&nbsp; At the time I couldn&#8217;t understand why he was adding to the pressure on me.&nbsp; But in retrospect, it is obvious.&nbsp; Rafiq always had a fixation on my breasts, and never seemed to tire of looking at them (or feeling them).

Rafiq peeled his shirt off.&nbsp; The Skipper followed.&nbsp; Then Ivy.

Rafiq&#8217;s eyes were glued to Ivy&#8217;s breasts.&nbsp; This would not do.&nbsp; Slowly I began to undo my shirt.&nbsp; I was wearing a buttoned blouse, unbuttoned but tied together below my breasts, baring my midriff.&nbsp; That is sexier than I had ever worn a blouse, but I was feeling that I wanted to keep Rafiq&#8217;s eyes on me and not on Ivy.&nbsp; In the past I might have felt that wearing a blouse that way might emphasize my lack of cleavage.&nbsp; But with all of Rafiq&#8217;s recent attention, I was feeling all right about that.

Anyway, I loosened the knot and began to open my blouse.&nbsp; Rafiq&#8217;s eyes shifted to my body.&nbsp; That was much better.

I let my shirt linger with my nipples just out of view for several moments.&nbsp; But I&#8217;ll confess that it was less out of modesty than out of a desire to make my action more dramatic.&nbsp; I hope it doesn&#8217;t create a bad impression for me to divulge that here.

I opened my blouse the rest of the way and slipped it off my arms.&nbsp; Rafiq gazed at my breasts, then looked into my eyes with a satisfied expression.&nbsp; But then he looked back at Ivy.&nbsp; For a time his gaze shifted back and forth between Ivy&#8217;s body and my body.&nbsp; It made me uncomfortable to feel that he was comparing me to Ivy.&nbsp; Not that there is anything particularly the matter with my body.

Skipper&#8217;s eyes were doing the same.&nbsp; It&#8217;s strange.&nbsp; If you bare your body, guys behave like they&#8217;ve never seen it before, no matter how recently they&#8217;ve seen you naked.

Ivy stretched back and yawned, putting her hands behind her head.&nbsp; All eyes were on her out-thrust chest.&nbsp; I did not mirror Ivy&#8217;s pose.&nbsp; I had no wish to attempt to compete in that way.&nbsp; Instead I just sat there feeling inadequate.&nbsp; Finally I said, �So were you going to tell us what happened next, Skipper?�

�What happened next?&nbsp; ...Oh, on Cayo Peligro.&nbsp; Yes, where was I?&nbsp; Let&#8217;s see, the elder sister was hanging upside down, arms tied behind her back, and Zarkov had just jabbed those pins into her nipples.�&nbsp; The Skipper was staring at Ivy&#8217;s out-thrust breasts.

Ivy brought her hands forward from behind her head, and leaning forward placed her elbows on the table.&nbsp; As brassy as Ivy is, apparently even she was a little intimidated by having this perverted guy gaping at her bare breasts while carrying on about stabbing pins into women&#8217;s nipples.

I, on the other hand, remaining as I was, hands pressing on the seat, trying to look unfazed.&nbsp; Score one for me.

Rafiq&#8217;s eyes shifted to my body ...or specifically to my breasts.&nbsp; So did the Skipper&#8217;s eyes.&nbsp; I continued to suppress the feelings of self consciousness.&nbsp; I looked at the Skipper expectantly, waiting for him to continue his story.

�So then Zarkov turned his attention to the younger sister, still hanging by her wrists.&nbsp; He takes a pin and pokes and probes at the nub of one of her nipples.&nbsp; She&#8217;s wincing and squirming.&nbsp; But after all that picking and scraping at the outlet of her milk duct, he never does actually sink it into her tit.

�He puts away the pin, and takes up his walking stick.&nbsp; ...Maybe I didn&#8217;t mention before that he had this walking stick.&nbsp; It was nice and smooth, kinda fat and bulbous at the top.

�He asks her if she wants to fuck on it.&nbsp; Her answer isn&#8217;t just no, it&#8217;s hell no.&nbsp; Well my boss wasn&#8217;t the kind of guy who&#8217;s used to having people say no to him.&nbsp; No isn&#8217;t an option.&nbsp; He rams that staff up her pussy, and there&#8217;s nothing she can do about it.&nbsp; He works her with it for a while.&nbsp; I can&#8217;t tell if she&#8217;s gasping with satisfaction or pain.

�Anyway, she&#8217;s impaled on that staff.&nbsp; Hanging by her wrists, feet off the ground, she&#8217;s trying to pull up as best she can, so that her weight isn&#8217;t thrusting her down so hard onto it.

�At this point, Zarkov takes out his box of pins again.&nbsp; He&#8217;s gonna stick them in her crotch.&nbsp; Her pussy lips are wrapped around that staff.&nbsp; And he&#8217;s going to thrust those pins into them now too.&nbsp; One, two, and three, on each side.&nbsp; She lets us know it hurts.

�He tells her he&#8217;s going to stick the last pin straight into her clitoris.&nbsp; As you can imagine, she voices strong objection to that idea.&nbsp; But he probes her with his fingers to unsheathe her clit, and slowly puts the pin to the pink nub.&nbsp; More and more pressure until it finally breaks the skin.&nbsp; She lets out a cry.&nbsp; Ever so slowly he slides it in to the hilt.&nbsp; She&#8217;s writhing with pain.

�So for now he leaves the younger sister, hanging there by her wrists, impaled on his staff, clit pinned.&nbsp; He turns back to the older sister and takes up his switch.

�Hanging upside down, legs apart, she&#8217;s the one who&#8217;s going to get a switching on the pussy.&nbsp; He starts in on the inside of her thighs.&nbsp; Stroke after stroke he gives her a good whipping.&nbsp; Countless red stripes on the inside of her thighs.

�Well this is all pretty fascinating to me.&nbsp; I had never seen anything like it before.&nbsp; But I feel for the younger sister, who has to watch all this, anticipating that she&#8217;ll soon have her turn.&nbsp; I try to comfort her a little.&nbsp; Standing behind her, I give her a hug, helping lift a bit of her weight off the shaft her pussy is impaled on.

�But I&#8217;m having lots of fun feeling up her tits.&nbsp; Squeeze, poke, pinch, mash.&nbsp; Like jelly under my fingers.

�And I can&#8217;t resist probing at her clitoris.&nbsp; She&#8217;s so sensitive.&nbsp; All I have to do is touch the head of the pin stuck into her clit, and it&#8217;s like she&#8217;s electric.&nbsp; Her hyper-responsive reaction &#8211; it&#8217;s such a turn on, I can&#8217;t help doing it to her.

�In the meantime, Zarkov is raining the switch down on the older sister&#8217;s pussy lips.&nbsp; Then he starts whacking it right into the cleft.&nbsp; She&#8217;s getting hysterical, begging him to stop.&nbsp; But he keeps going at it for quite some time.&nbsp; Whips her pussy good.

�But he does finally lay off.&nbsp; She just hangs there gasping while he gives her a lot of praise.&nbsp; He hands me the switch to use on the younger sister, while he soothes the older sister&#8217;s anguished pussy with his fingers, then with his tongue.

�So now I&#8217;m supposed to put the switch to the younger sister&#8217;s tits.&nbsp; I start swatting them.&nbsp; I like the way the fat jiggles...&nbsp; the impact travels across them like a wave.

�I give her a couple dozen strokes, decorating her breasts with charming horizontal stripes.&nbsp; She&#8217;s gasping with each stroke, even though I&#8217;ve spared her nipples so far.&nbsp; ...I don&#8217;t know.&nbsp; Maybe I hadn&#8217;t actually hit her all that hard.&nbsp; Jenny knows I don&#8217;t whip girl&#8217;s tits all that hard, right?

�What?� I replied.&nbsp; That question took me by surprise.&nbsp; �You whip mine really hard.�

�No I don&#8217;t.&nbsp; Not compared to what you need.�

�What do you mean &#8216;compared to what I need&#8217;?&nbsp; I don&#8217;t need a whipping on the breasts.&nbsp; ...Not as hard as you do it.�

When Ivy giggled, I realized my error.&nbsp; Amending it, I said,&nbsp; �I mean, I don&#8217;t need a whipping on the breasts period.�

Skipper replied, �Of course those titties need a whipping.&nbsp; If not on the tits, then where do you want to be whipped?�&nbsp; He reached over and touched my breast.

I pushed his hand away.&nbsp; �I don&#8217;t want to be whipped at all, anywhere.�

Rafiq was laughing silently, eyes squinched shut, hand on forehead.&nbsp; I punched his shoulder.&nbsp; Then I punched again harder.&nbsp; He suppressed his laugh and smiled at me as I frowned at him.

Looking away from all of them, and folding my arms across my chest, I said, �I&#8217;m not listening to anything any of you say about me.&nbsp; So if you want to be assholes, go ahead.�

Putting his arm around me, Rafiq said, �Right now Jenny doesn&#8217;t want to be the subject of conversations about whippings.&nbsp; Maybe you should just continue your story, Skipper.�

Skipper said, �Maybe you&#8217;re right, Rock.&nbsp; To me, Jenny being whipped is a great topic for conversation, but if she doesn&#8217;t care for it, we can move on.&nbsp; There&#8217;s no accounting for people&#8217;s tastes.&nbsp; ...Anyway, where was I?�

Rafiq replied, �You were whipping the younger sister&#8217;s tits.&nbsp; But so far you had spared her nipples.�

�Oh yeah.&nbsp; But those nipples really needed the switch.&nbsp; They were the ultimate puffy nipples.&nbsp; I mean, like, Jenny&#8217;s nipples are fairly puffy, but not like this girl&#8217;s.&nbsp; They were super puffy.�

I frowned at the Skipper, arms still crossed over my breasts.&nbsp; �Do you mind?&nbsp; I don&#8217;t want my body used as a mark for comparison.�

�Oh...&nbsp; You think your body is beyond comparison?&nbsp; Well maybe it is.&nbsp; But could you stop covering yourself with your hands so we can appreciate your superlatives better.�

�Now wait.&nbsp; I just don&#8217;t want my body to be the subject of conversation.&nbsp; I didn&#8217;t say anything about being beyond comparison.&nbsp; I&#8217;m not the vain one at the table.�

As soon as I said that, I knew it was wrong.&nbsp; Ivy looked at me quizzically.&nbsp; �Did you aim that at me?� she asked.

I knew I was out of bounds.&nbsp; Yes, Ivy is openly vain.&nbsp; But I have to admit that I am secretly vain.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t make a show of my appearance.&nbsp; But I like to think I look good anyway.

I said, �No.&nbsp; That was a dumb thing for me to say.&nbsp; Sorry.�

Ivy said, �Skipper, when you finish your story, we should reenact it on Jenny.�

I said, �Then reenact it on you too.&nbsp; There&#8217;s two girls in the story.�

�Okay.&nbsp; I&#8217;m not afraid.&nbsp; Are you?� asked Ivy.

�No, I&#8217;m not afraid.&nbsp; But I don&#8217;t happen to be interested in a reenactment.&nbsp; So you can undergo it by yourself.�

�Girls, please.&nbsp; You&#8217;re bickering again,� said the Skipper.&nbsp; �But shall I continue my story.&nbsp; When I get done, then we can decide what&#8217;s best for you.�

�You&#8217;ll decide what&#8217;s best?� I said.&nbsp; �Why should you decide what&#8217;s best for me?�

�Because I&#8217;m the captain of this vessel.&nbsp; I have to look after my crew.�

�Maybe I&#8217;d rather you didn&#8217;t.&nbsp; ...But I have a feeling that I&#8217;ve said too much already.�

�Your instincts are good, Jenny,� the Skipper replied, eyeing me ominously.

�Yes, sir,� I said quietly.&nbsp; �Umph...� placing my hands over my mouth, trying to disarm him.

�That&#8217;s a good girl.&nbsp; Now where was I?�

�You were talking about the younger sister&#8217;s puffy nipples,� said Rafiq.

�Oh yeah.&nbsp; ...Those nipples needed the switch.�&nbsp; He paused, seeming to contemplate Ivy&#8217;s breasts.&nbsp; My own were hidden by my arms, since my hands were covering my mouth.&nbsp; Then he said, �But I need to see everybody&#8217;s tits to continue my story.&nbsp; Jenny, Ivy, put your hands behind your head.�

With a negative shake of my head, I made a muffled, �Umph, umph,� through my hands, facetiously signifying that it was more important that I keep my mouth shut.

�Here, I&#8217;ll help you out,� said Rafiq, pushing my hands away, and forcefully covering my mouth and nose with his own hand.

With a muffled complaint, I wrenched away from him.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t like my face handled roughly and I don&#8217;t like my air cut off.&nbsp; I felt like I was being violated.&nbsp; ...I realize that such a negative reaction to Rafiq&#8217;s playfulness must sound strange, after recounting all the corporal punishment I had accepted in the past days.

No doubt Rafiq was surprised by my negative response.&nbsp; He released his grip.&nbsp; Still eyeing him with disapproval, I slowly placed my hands behind my head.&nbsp; Ivy, grinning, followed suit.

Alternately eyeing our breasts, the Skipper continued his story.&nbsp; �So anyway, I whacked that switch hard across her nipples.&nbsp; She let out a hell of a cry.&nbsp; She&#8217;s like wrenching back and forth.

�But that doesn&#8217;t deter me.&nbsp; I whacked those nipples again.&nbsp; And then again...&nbsp; and again.&nbsp; I was raining the switch down on her tits.&nbsp; If she had puffy nipples to begin with, they were a hell of lot puffier when I got done with her.

�Anyway, while I was whipping the younger sister&#8217;s tits, Zarkov wanted the older one to lick him off.&nbsp; She&#8217;s still hanging upside down.

�But like I mentioned before, he&#8217;s got the most ghastly case of jock rot ever.&nbsp; She takes one look as his fungus-ridden dick and balls, and it&#8217;s like no way.&nbsp; No way.

�But like I said, Zarkov isn&#8217;t the type to take no as an answer.&nbsp; He puts his hands to her breasts &#8211; they&#8217;ve got all those map pins stuck in them &#8211; and presses inward, kneading them slowly and firmly.

�With those pins stuck in her, you can imagine what that feels like.&nbsp; She starts screaming.&nbsp; It&#8217;s way more than she can bear.&nbsp; No choice but to take his dick in her mouth and give him a blow job.

�Meanwhile I just keep whipping the other girl&#8217;s tits.&nbsp; There was one stretch where I must have laid on fifty straight, really hard, right across those puffy nipples.&nbsp; God, I must have been crazy.&nbsp; She was a strong girl, seemed to take natural to whippings.&nbsp; But not that strong.&nbsp; She was starting to loose it.&nbsp; But I won&#8217;t let up.&nbsp; I was seized by this insane lust to flail her tits.

�But Zarkov finally shot his load into his girl&#8217;s mouth, and with that done, he called me off.&nbsp; We released the girls and brought them back to his chateau.

�We cleaned up the girls, and then offered them late afternoon tea, which is in fact a light meal.&nbsp; Zarkov was very solicitous, even asked them about their family and all.&nbsp; Then he paid them, triple the agreed upon wage for doing such a great job.&nbsp; Zarkov bid them goodbye, and I took them by boat back to the mainland.

�Keep in mind that the older sister had pleasured Zarkov, but after the day&#8217;s activities, I was desperate to blow my load.&nbsp; So I ask the younger sister, her name was Maria, if she&#8217;d like a little boat ride along the coast after we drop her sister off, and she agrees.

�So Maria and I take a short boat ride, drop anchor and have a good fuck.&nbsp; ...Yeah, she was a cutie.&nbsp; I liked licking the welts on her tits.&nbsp; She looked like a fucking zebra from that whipping I had given her.&nbsp; But she had no resentment about it.&nbsp; Like I said, she seemed to have a natural bent toward it.�

The Skipper sat back.&nbsp; �Yeah, it&#8217;s a fond memory.�

�That&#8217;s a really good story,� said Rafiq.&nbsp; �Did you make that up on the fly, or had you worked it out beforehand?�

�What do you mean &#8216;make it up&#8217;?� growled the Skipper.&nbsp; �Are you questioning whether I&#8217;m telling a true story?�

�Of course it&#8217;s not a true story,� said Rafiq.&nbsp; �Even so, you did a great job putting a sexual spin on that Richard Connell short story &#8216;The Most Dangerous Game&#8217;.&nbsp; I noticed you reading it a few days ago, from that anthology I brought along.&nbsp; ...Not that it matters whether it&#8217;s fact or fiction.�

Glaring at Rafiq, the Skipper said, �Rock, you question my veracity and I&#8217;ll...&nbsp; I&#8217;ll...�

�Oh don&#8217;t start with your silly threats,� said Rafiq.&nbsp; �But on second thought, go ahead, amuse me.&nbsp; Be imaginative.&nbsp; What are you going to do to me?�

Still glaring at Rafiq, the Skipper said, �If you don&#8217;t show me proper respect, I&#8217;ll...&nbsp; I&#8217;ll whip your girlfriend.�&nbsp; He glanced toward me.

At that Rafiq leaned back laughing.&nbsp; �Yes!&nbsp; Yes!&nbsp; Yes!� he said.&nbsp; �I didn&#8217;t expect you to say that, Skipper, but it&#8217;s so apt.�

I frowned at Rafiq.&nbsp; Why was he so amused?&nbsp; I saw nothing funny about it.&nbsp; Here I was sitting at a table, half naked, with three people well disposed toward getting sexual pleasure by punishing me.&nbsp; I punched his shoulder, complaining, �Rafiq!�

But he ignored me, saying �So what do we have here?&nbsp; Ivy wants Jenny punished for underage drinking, even if she&#8217;s so temperate she still hasn&#8217;t finished that daiquiri.&nbsp; Skipper wants Jenny punished because I couldn&#8217;t help recognizing that his wondrous story was fiction.&nbsp; So what do you think, Jenny?&nbsp; Do you want to reenact parts of Skipper&#8217;s story?&nbsp; Unfortunately, with no island handy, we can&#8217;t reenact the chase, but we could reenact the punishment.�

�No, I don&#8217;t want anybody sticking pins in me.&nbsp; I haven&#8217;t done anything to deserve punishment.�

�Sure you have,� said the Skipper.&nbsp; �You&#8217;re a pretty girl, aren&#8217;t you?�

�What are you, a misogynist?� I replied.

�No.&nbsp; Not at all.&nbsp; I consider women the pinnacle of creation.&nbsp; That&#8217;s why they need to be punished, to keep them from getting ideas.�

�Come on Jenny,� said Ivy.&nbsp; �It would be a new experience to have pins stuck in you.&nbsp; You must be turned on by the idea.�

I was not drawn to the idea of having pins jabbed into me, especially not in my nipples or pussy.&nbsp; And I was disturbed by the idea being cast as someone who accepts all manner of punishment.&nbsp; What is it about the way I say &#8216;no&#8217; that people don&#8217;t understand?

I felt a knot in my stomach.&nbsp; Not sure what I should do in this awkward situation, I just wanted to get away. �I need some air.&nbsp; Do you mind if I excuse myself?�











Chapter 6.&nbsp; The Sea of No and Yes

Making my exit from the cabin, I got my shirt back on before I reached the deck.&nbsp; Once outside I felt much better.&nbsp; The late afternoon air was not so hot, the sun a couple hours away from the horizon.&nbsp; James was at the helm.&nbsp; April was napping on a blanket.

Up to now I haven&#8217;t had much reason to talk about my relationship with James.&nbsp; Initially I spoke very little to him.&nbsp; Nevertheless, as the voyage continued I got to know him better.

April of course spent a fair amount of time with him.&nbsp; But with us girls she sometimes complained about his Neanderthal-grade sensitivity.

I didn&#8217;t have that much in common with him.&nbsp; But I felt that he was the only male here who wanted nothing from me sexually, and that accorded me a certain ease with his company.

Although our conversations were somewhat limited, he actually was occasionally capable of talking about something other than sports or games.&nbsp; And although I am hardly a fan of spectator sports, I am capable of some conversation about certain sports, for example, women&#8217;s soccer.

The time of the voyage, a few years ago, was a couple years after the U.S. women&#8217;s professional soccer league had folded, bankrupt.&nbsp; Surprisingly, James was knowledgeable about the women&#8217;s soccer league, and was quite sympathetic about its plight.

�Yeah, it&#8217;s too bad they couldn&#8217;t keep going,� he said.&nbsp; �They had some good people.&nbsp; It could have developed.&nbsp; Competition is relative...&nbsp; Anyway, I liked watching it.�

�Me too,� I replied.&nbsp; �Or sometimes anyway... more than other sports.&nbsp; But I guess I&#8217;m surprised you would watch it.&nbsp; It&#8217;s not exactly macho.�

�Oh.&nbsp; Well, yeah, but I&#8217;ll watch just about any sport.�

�Yeah, I had that impression.�

�Hey, don&#8217;t get the wrong idea.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t just lay around.&nbsp; I pump iron while I&#8217;m watching.�&nbsp; Subtly he flexed his biceps.&nbsp; Realizing that I had noticed, he smiled.&nbsp; Now fully flexing his right biceps, he asked �How&#8217;s that?�

I decided to flatter him.&nbsp; �Wow,� I exclaimed, wrapping both hands around his bulging right biceps.&nbsp; �Maybe you&#8217;re even stronger than Rafiq.�

�Maybe? ...Maybe?�&nbsp; James gave me this look of disdain.&nbsp; �I mean, like, Rock&#8217;s okay for a guy his size.&nbsp; But when you&#8217;re lookin&#8217; at me, you&#8217;re lookin&#8217; at real power.�

I didn&#8217;t argue with that.&nbsp; Both James and Rafiq are well built and muscular, but James is taller and heavier.&nbsp; He&#8217;s a big guy.&nbsp; �Hey.&nbsp; Whatever...� I replied.

�Anyway, what were we talking about?� continued James, perhaps sensing that I was not too receptive to his boastfulness, particularly not at the expense of Rafiq.&nbsp; �Oh yeah, women&#8217;s soccer.&nbsp; ...I think that league would have done better if they had wore sexier outfits.&nbsp; Then the game would&#8217;ve had more dimensions.�

�Ugh.&nbsp; That seems gross.&nbsp; Can&#8217;t a woman athlete just be an athlete?�

�What&#8217;s your problem?� he replied.&nbsp; �Compare it to watching you take the whip.&nbsp; That&#8217;s sort of like an athletic contest.&nbsp; To see who&#8217;s stronger, you or the whip.&nbsp; But your outfit, or lack of one, adds to the spectacle.�

�Oh boy,� I sighed.&nbsp; �This conversation&#8217;s taking an unsavory turn.�

�Tell me, how does it feel to get whipped on the tits?�

�How does it feel?�&nbsp; I looked at him for a moment, more than a little put off by his crass bluntness.&nbsp; �What kind of a dumb question is that?&nbsp; How about, &#8216;it hurts.&#8217;&nbsp; What are you expecting me to say?&nbsp; &#8216;It&#8217;s like a sensuous caress&#8217;?�

�Yeah.&nbsp; That&#8217;s good.&nbsp; How would you like the caress of the whip right now?�

�Get lost.�

�Ah, you&#8217;re not my type anyway.&nbsp; ...But have you ever considered getting a boob job?�

A boob job?&nbsp; I stared at him in disbelief.&nbsp; Finally I said, �You are the most insulting asshole I&#8217;ve ever met.�&nbsp; With that, I got up and left.

I went below.&nbsp; I didn&#8217;t know what to do with myself.&nbsp; I didn&#8217;t want to go into the compartment where Rafiq, Skipper, and Ivy were.&nbsp; I just didn&#8217;t feel up to the demands they would make on me.&nbsp; I wasn&#8217;t going back on deck and endure insults from James.&nbsp; And I didn&#8217;t want to retreat into the women&#8217;s compartment by myself, to dwell in feelings of inadequacy.

I decided to go in the galley to make dinner.&nbsp; Although it was April&#8217;s turn to cook, I decided to start something while she was napping on deck.

But still, from the galley I could hear the goings on in the other compartment.&nbsp; I could hear Ivy&#8217;s gasps and occasional yelps.&nbsp; But it didn&#8217;t sound like anybody was swatting her.&nbsp; I wondered if she had let them stick pins in her.

If I went in to join them, I would probably end up on the receiving end.&nbsp; But I was really curious.&nbsp; Also I was concerned about Rafiq and Ivy together.&nbsp; In the last day or so, I had been wondering if I was sensing a rekindling of their old relationship.&nbsp; Finally I decided to take just a little peek.

Going to their doorway, I looked in furtively.&nbsp; There was Ivy on the table, giving a blow job to the Skipper ...and there was Rafiq, fucking her!&nbsp; I was shocked.&nbsp; I was crushed.

Forget about dinner.&nbsp; I retreated to the women&#8217;s bedroom.&nbsp; I felt like my world was caving in.&nbsp; I started crying.&nbsp; Why wasn&#8217;t I good enough to satisfy Rafiq?

Lying in my berth, my mind went through one state after another.&nbsp; First was the deep pit of self pity.&nbsp; I was a worthless person and a fool to think that Rafiq could ever love me.&nbsp; For Rafiq, I was merely a fling, based only on the temporary confluence of the streams of our lives aboard this vessel.

But then I began thinking, so what?&nbsp; Could I not enjoy these moments with Rafiq for what they were?&nbsp; Could I not live each present moment fully without regard for what the next moment might bring?&nbsp; After all, past and future exist only as ideas.&nbsp; Doesn&#8217;t the present have an underlying suchness that transcends the particulars?

Yet all mind states are transitory, and moments of genuine lucidness are fleeting.&nbsp; From here I starting fantasizing that as a person who exists fully in each moment, I would be such a pleasure to be with that Rafiq could not help being captivated by me.&nbsp; I would be his girl, forever.

Yet perhaps he would fail to see my virtue.&nbsp; In his blindness, he might pass over the one most deserving of his love.&nbsp; Yes, then I would be sacrificed on the altar of unrequited love, a martyr, celibate, living in quiet sadness.

...What utter nonsense.&nbsp; If I were actually a person who lived in the present moment, I would not be wallowing in such twaddle-thinking.&nbsp; I was addicted to images.&nbsp; Puffing myself up, tearing myself down.&nbsp; Two sides of the same coin.&nbsp; An illusion of self.

I doubted that I had the spiritual power to maintain my attention firmly in the here and now.&nbsp; My mind is always being carried away into self-centered thoughts and fantasies, reechoing the past, imagining the future.&nbsp; Why does it take years of meditative training just to be wherever you are?

But wasn&#8217;t this just more of the same?&nbsp; Thinking, thinking, thinking.&nbsp; About me, me, me.&nbsp; Could this endless cycle be broken?

I took a deep breath, exhaled, and just listened to the sounds of the boat moving through the sea.&nbsp; But just listened to it as a sound of flowing motion, sans image of either boat or sea.

I felt the tactile sensation of the mattress against my body.&nbsp; I felt and released the tension in my neck, in my stomach, in my legs.&nbsp; Tension wrought by thoughts and wants.&nbsp; Things I could let go of.&nbsp; They need not impinge.

...After some time like this, feeling more energized, I decided to get up and get back into circulation.&nbsp; I jumped down from my berth.&nbsp; Just as I was about to exit, Ivy came in.

She closed the door and turned to me.&nbsp; �Oh shit, my tits,� she said, grimacing.&nbsp; �Oh-my-god, why did I ever let them stick acupuncture needles in me.&nbsp; Right in the nipples.&nbsp; I thought I was going to faint.&nbsp; You were smart to get out when you did.�

She lifted her bikini top to reveal her breasts, and indicating her right nipple, she asked, �Does it look bad?�

I felt a little funny about examining her that way, but I looked closely at her nipple.&nbsp; I imagined the worst, that they had thrust it right down the nub, but there was no blood coming out.&nbsp; �I don&#8217;t really see anything.�

�There,� she said, pointing to a tiny dot on her areola.&nbsp; �And there...&nbsp; and there&#8217;s a third one somewhere... there it is.�

�Oh... yeah, now I see.&nbsp; Three little pinpricks.&nbsp; But they look okay.�

�And there&#8217;s one on the other one,� indicating her other nipple.&nbsp; But I wouldn&#8217;t let them do any more.

�At first I thought they had stuck it into the nub, like right down the ducts.�

�Oh shit no.&nbsp; I wouldn&#8217;t let anybody do that.&nbsp; Are you crazy?�

�Well, it freaks me out even to think about it.&nbsp; But I didn&#8217;t know.&nbsp; I guess I assumed the worst.&nbsp;&nbsp; ...But, like how far did they stick them in.�

�Really far.�

I imagined an acupuncture needle as long as my little finger, thrust all the way in.&nbsp; Ivy&#8217;s B-cupper breasts might be big enough to take the whole thing, but I cringed at the idea of somebody sticking such a long needle all the way through my breast and into the chest wall.&nbsp; I sucked air through my teeth.

Ivy continued, �Oh-my-god, they must have stuck them in like a quarter inch.&nbsp; Then Rafiq bobbled them back and forth.&nbsp; I thought I was going to die.�

�Oh...&nbsp; I thought they stuck them in like all the way or something.�

�You bitch.&nbsp; Why are you so fucking unsympathetic?&nbsp; It really hurt.&nbsp; Why are you acting like they should have done it so much worse?&nbsp; Here, I&#8217;ll stick something all way down into your nipples if you think you&#8217;re so tough.&nbsp; Right down the middle.�

�Oh-my-god, Ivy.&nbsp; I&#8217;m sorry.&nbsp; I didn&#8217;t mean to sound unsympathetic.&nbsp; I&#8217;d be freaked out to have anybody even touching my nipples with a needle, let alone sticking it in.&nbsp; I could never have endured what you did. ...That&#8217;s why I had to leave when you guys started talking about sticking things in my tits.�

�Oh...&nbsp; All right.&nbsp; Whatever.&nbsp; Sorry I snapped at you.�&nbsp; Still facing me, Ivy continued examining her right nipple, turning it up to better see it.

I wondered about her brazenness about wanting me to examine her breasts so closely.&nbsp; I would be much more modest.&nbsp; I wondered whether she was really that unselfconscious about her body, or whether this was some form of one-upmanship, to show off her perfect tits.

But maybe I was being unfair in my judgments.&nbsp; Wanting to end this encounter with warm feelings, I said, �Would it feel better if I gave them a little kiss.&nbsp; It&#8217;s the only way I can think to help.�

Ivy smiled at that suggestion.&nbsp; �Yeah,� she said.&nbsp; �A little kiss, real gentle.&nbsp; This one still hurts.�

I softly kissed her nipples, first the right, the sore one, then the left.&nbsp; With that one I tongued the nub, then pressed it between my lips.

Stroking her fingers through my hair, Ivy purred, �Yes.&nbsp; They feel better already.�

I liked having Ivy respond to me like this.&nbsp; I liked being able to control her sexual pleasure.&nbsp; I began sucking on her nipple.&nbsp; I knew Ivy was enjoying it.&nbsp; She wanted more.

But I didn&#8217;t want to give her more.&nbsp; I wanted the satisfaction of withholding what she wanted.&nbsp; Sucking hard, I pulled away from her nipple.&nbsp; It came away from my lips with a soppy pop.

I said, �Your poor nipples; I hope they feel better now.�&nbsp; In the back of my mind, I savored having just referred to her beautiful breasts as poor.&nbsp; My mind very much wanted to find her lacking.&nbsp; But certainly my feelings toward her were rooted in how bad I felt about myself at that point in time.

I turned to leave the room... but then turned back toward her.&nbsp; There was one more thing I just had to bring up.&nbsp; �Ivy, I don&#8217;t question that it really hurt to have needles stuck in your tits.&nbsp;&nbsp; ...But when I peeked in, it looked like you were having a good time ...with Rafiq.�

�Oh, that.�&nbsp; Ivy looked away with a little smile.&nbsp; �Well...&nbsp; the guys were having a good time.&nbsp; But that didn&#8217;t mean I was.&nbsp; I just faked an orgasm.&nbsp; ...But maybe the whole thing was worth it.�

I was silent for several moments.&nbsp; Then I said, �You know, Ivy, it&#8217;s really hard for me to get used to the idea of sharing.�

Quickly adjusting her bikini top to cover her breasts, Ivy looked at me soberly&nbsp; �How do you think I feel?&nbsp; Do you think it&#8217;s easy for me to share Rafiq with you?�

�Oh...� I realized how one-sided my thinking was.&nbsp; �I&#8217;m sorry.&nbsp; I guess I was just thinking about myself.�&nbsp; I touched Ivy&#8217;s shoulder.&nbsp; She pulled me toward her and we gave each other a little hug.

�Yeah, it&#8217;s hard,� she replied.&nbsp; �And is that two-timer worth it?&nbsp; I wish I could convince you he isn&#8217;t.�

I smiled and said, �Yeah, he&#8217;s a double-dealer.&nbsp; He&#8217;s got us both on a tether.�

Ivy said, �Right now he&#8217;s taking a siesta after his strenuous sexual exertions.&nbsp; I lay down with him for a while, but these berths aren&#8217;t big enough for two people, especially if one of them hogs what little space there is.�

�I&#8217;m glad he&#8217;s asleep,� I said.&nbsp; �I don&#8217;t want to deal with seeing him now.�&nbsp; I wasn&#8217;t sure that was true.&nbsp; I had anxiety about seeing him, but still I wanted him.

Turning to the door, I left.

********

Later that evening I was cleaning up the galley.&nbsp; April and James were in the men&#8217;s compartment.&nbsp; Rafiq was taking his turn at the helm.&nbsp; I think Ivy was out there with him.&nbsp; I had not yet spoken to him alone.&nbsp; I had wished he would seek me out.

The Skipper came in.&nbsp; �Ho, Jenny.&nbsp; You missed some heavy action this afternoon.&nbsp; I wasn&#8217;t sure you were feeling all right when you left.�

�Oh, it was nothing.&nbsp; I guess I just felt a little... unsettled.�

�Well, how do you feel now?�

�I&#8217;m okay.&nbsp; Just a little emotionally stressed.&nbsp; It&#8217;s nothing.�

�Emotionally stressed?�&nbsp; After a pause, he said, �Oh yes, of course.&nbsp; The tribulations of young romance.&nbsp; Is there anything I can do for you?�

�No, nothing.&nbsp; Really I&#8217;m fine.�&nbsp; Then like a fool I said, �And don&#8217;t come on with your medical officer routine either.�

The Skipper&#8217;s eyes brightened.&nbsp; �Yes.&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; Chief medical officer.&nbsp; I nearly forgot.&nbsp; I&#8217;ll have to take care of you.&nbsp; I&#8217;ll have to examine you right now.�

�No you don&#8217;t.&nbsp; I&#8217;m having no part of that.&nbsp; Pick somebody else to play doctor with.�

The Skipper eyed my body for a moment.&nbsp; Then he turned and left.&nbsp; What a surprise.&nbsp; It seemed almost anticlimactic.

...But he returned a few minutes later, and now he had a bag of stuff.&nbsp; �All right.&nbsp; I think we&#8217;re ready here.&nbsp; My medical bag,� he said brightly, putting the plastic grocery bag on the counter.&nbsp; Almost certainly it had various devices for tormenting me.

�Now wait a minute.&nbsp; I&#8217;m not going along with this.�

�Of course you are.&nbsp; Look what happened this afternoon.&nbsp; We neglected you.&nbsp; We let you not go along with things.&nbsp; And look what a bad outcome it had for you.&nbsp; You&#8217;re all stressed out now because of it.�

�But...&nbsp;&nbsp; But...�&nbsp; His twisted logic hit annoyingly close to home.&nbsp; But still so wrong.

�No buts about it.&nbsp; I need to take care of you now.�

�But even if I were stressed out, you&#8217;ve got nothing to do with it.�

�What do you mean I got nothing to do with it.&nbsp; I was one of the people who let you make a bad decision this afternoon.&nbsp;&nbsp; ...But I suppose you&#8217;re trying to say that I&#8217;m not Rock.�

�Yes.&nbsp; That is what I&#8217;m trying to say.�

�Well Rock is occupied right now...&nbsp; with you-know-who.&nbsp; I&#8217;m the one who can give you the attention you need now.&nbsp; Besides, as chief medical officer, I&#8217;m much more qualified than Rock.&nbsp; So let&#8217;s begin the examination now.&nbsp; I need you to strip to the waist like a proper patient.&nbsp; No more arguments.�

Folding my arms across my chest, I said, �No.&nbsp; You shouldn&#8217;t try to get me to take my clothes off that way.�&nbsp;&nbsp; ...As I said that, I wondered if it sounded as if I were being a tease.

�Oh...�&nbsp; He glanced back at the doorway, smiled, and said, �What am I doing leaving the door open so that any passing stranger could see you strip for your medical examination.�

He turned and slid the door shut.&nbsp; And locked it.&nbsp; Now he really had me where he wanted me.&nbsp; �That&#8217;s better, right?&nbsp; Now you can take off your top.�

Arms still across my chest, I shook my head, saying nothing.

Going into his bag, the Skipper took out a martinet.&nbsp; He dangled it in front of my face.&nbsp; It had maybe a dozen slender strands, less than a half-meter long, attached to a short handle.&nbsp; Compared with the implements I had been whipped with in the previous days, I didn&#8217;t find it all that intimidating.&nbsp; ...Maybe I can admit being a little curious about what it would feel like.

�I suppose you want a good whipping first.&nbsp; Is that right?�

I said nothing, just continued facing him.

He drew back the whip and lashed it across the side of my thigh.&nbsp; Small and light as it was, it packed a pretty good sting.&nbsp; But I held my ground.

He lashed me again.&nbsp; Then again.&nbsp; And again.&nbsp; He wasn&#8217;t holding back.&nbsp; I winced and squirmed.&nbsp; He continued whipping me on the side of the thigh.&nbsp; I couldn&#8217;t help gasping with each stroke.

After about twenty hard strokes, he grabbed my arm and forcefully tuned me around, saying, �Put your hands on the counter.&nbsp; Arch your back.�&nbsp; Then he lit into the backs of my thighs.

He lashed me over and over.&nbsp; I kept fairly quiet, and held my vocalizations to gasps and little yelps.&nbsp; He must have laid on another twenty strokes before he paused and said, �You really enjoy this, don&#8217;t you?�

�No, I do not.&nbsp; It&#8217;s you that enjoys punishing me.�

�I don&#8217;t deny the satisfaction I get from giving you the whipping you need.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t have a problem telling you that.�

I rubbed my stinging thighs for a moment before saying, �Well... with all this stuff with Rafiq and Ivy, I&#8217;m&nbsp; just not feeling real good about myself right now.&nbsp; So maybe I do feel like this is something I deserve.&nbsp;&nbsp; ...But you&#8217;re taking advantage of how I feel.�

�No.&nbsp; I&#8217;m making you feel better.�&nbsp; Then he went into his bag and pulled out a wooden paddle.&nbsp; It was narrow, somewhat wider than a ruler, and thicker and heavier.&nbsp; �Tell me how this feels.�

He swatted me hard on the butt through my shorts.&nbsp; It made such a loud whap that everyone on the boat must have heard it.&nbsp; I winced but kept quiet.

He swatted me again.&nbsp; ...And then again.&nbsp;&nbsp; ...Then he swatted me on the back of the thighs ...on the bare flesh.&nbsp; What a loud crack.&nbsp; �Ow!&nbsp; Shit... That hurt.�&nbsp; Gasping, I rubbed the backs of my thighs.&nbsp;&nbsp; ...Crack!&nbsp; �Ooooh!&nbsp;&nbsp; ...Crack!&nbsp; �Ahhh!�&nbsp; ...Crack!&nbsp; Crack!&nbsp; Crack!&nbsp; �Ow, ow ow!�&nbsp; It was three in quick succession.&nbsp; The backs of my thighs were on fire.

�Now turn around.�

Panting, I looked at him trying to gage his intent.&nbsp; Then I slowly turned around, facing outward from the counter.

�Hold on to the edge of the counter behind you.�

I obeyed.

�Have you ever been paddled on the breasts.�

�No, don&#8217;t do that,� I replied, bringing one arm up to protect my breasts.&nbsp; I had once been spanked on the bare breasts with a light wooden ruler (as told in a previous story).&nbsp; This paddle was bigger and heavier than a ruler.&nbsp; I was afraid it could bruise me.

�You&#8217;re saying you&#8217;ve never been spanked on the breasts with a wooden implement?�

I felt the sense of threat from him.&nbsp; Rafiq may have passed along things I told had him of my past experiences.&nbsp; I said, �Well, not with anything as big as that.&nbsp; It could really hurt me.&nbsp; ...Aren&#8217;t you the chief medical officer?�

�Yes.&nbsp; I&#8217;m glad you finally recognize that.&nbsp; Now my medical advice to you is to cease your obstinate disobedience and remove your shirt.�

�Can you put the paddle down first?�

He responded by swatting me hard on the side of the thigh.

�Ow!&nbsp; Please no.�

�Now take your shirt off.&nbsp; You&#8217;ll just have to trust that I won&#8217;t paddle your girl flesh.�

I slowly unbuttoned my blouse.&nbsp; I stood for a moment with it unbuttoned, then opened it to reveal myself, and slipped it off.&nbsp; I just let it drop to the floor and then left my hands at my sides.&nbsp; All the while I held my eyes on his.&nbsp; His eyes alternated between my eyes and my body.&nbsp; He had a smile of satisfaction. 

�Good girl,� he said.&nbsp; He raised the paddle to my right breast.&nbsp; I continued to trust, although I may have bowed my chest slightly away from it.&nbsp; He touched the paddle to the base of my breast and pressed it upward.&nbsp; Then with his other hand he fondled my nipple.

I squirmed but let him continue.&nbsp; He played with my nipple for some time.&nbsp; Then he turned his attention to the other breast.

With his paddle he tapped the base of my left breast.&nbsp; First very gently, just making it jiggle a bit.&nbsp; Then gradually increasing in intensity.&nbsp; I endured the escalating sensation for as long as I could.&nbsp; When it started to hurt, I recoiled away from it.

He laid off and now merely slid the paddle back and forth across my nipple.&nbsp; The smooth finish offered little friction; the coolness of the wood was the primary sensation.&nbsp; My nipples were stiff.

Turning back to the other breast and holding its base with the paddle, he said, �Tell me, how do you feel about your breasts?�

�Like I don&#8217;t want you to pound on them with a slab of wood.�

He laughed at that.&nbsp; Then he said, �No, I mean in general how do you feel about them?�

�What do you mean, how do I feel about them?�

�You know... do you like them.&nbsp; Do you like having breasts?�

�Well... not having them isn&#8217;t an option, is it?&nbsp; ...And what kind of question is that anyway?&nbsp; It doesn&#8217;t seem appropriate.�

�It&#8217;s highly appropriate.&nbsp; As chief medical officer, I have to look into your holistic health&nbsp; ...like the interaction of your mind and body.&nbsp; That&#8217;s the kind of language you&#8217;re into, isn&#8217;t it?�&nbsp; Then he twitched the paddle on my breast.&nbsp; 

Although I didn&#8217;t buy his rationale, it felt a bit prissy to try to evade an answer.&nbsp; After a moment I said, �All right.&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; Maybe I like having breasts.�

The Skipper smiled.&nbsp; Then prodding my breast with the paddle, he asked, �Are you proud of your breasts?�

Here was another awkward question.&nbsp; I&#8217;m not unhappy with my body.&nbsp; It seems like my breasts look okay.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t have a major issue with my less than average endowment.&nbsp; But the question made me uncomfortable.&nbsp; After a moment I said, �I&#8217;m not into pride.&nbsp; It just seems unwholesome to me.�

�Oh...&nbsp; Well, do you think your breasts are pretty?�

He was persisting with this awkward line of questions.&nbsp; I replied, �I guess I&#8217;m okay with how I look, overall.�

�I didn&#8217;t ask &#8216;overall&#8217;.&nbsp; I asked specifically about your breasts.&nbsp; Do you think your breasts are pretty?�

�I&#8217;m not comfortable with that kind of question.&nbsp; If they&#8217;re pretty, they&#8217;re pretty.&nbsp; If not, they&#8217;re not.&nbsp; There&#8217;s nothing I can do about it either way.&nbsp; ...So why don&#8217;t you answer the question yourself.&nbsp; ...No, on second thought, I&#8217;d rather we just changed the subject.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t want to talk about my appearance.�

�I think the appearance of women is a delightful topic.&nbsp; And I&#8217;ve made my opinion about your breasts clear on various occasions.&nbsp; I&#8217;m asking you about your opinion.�

�All right, if women&#8217;s breasts are pretty, then mine are pretty.�

He slapped the side of my breast with the paddle.&nbsp; �Ouch!&nbsp; Why did you do that?�&nbsp; I brought my hands&nbsp; up to protect myself.

�Because you keep deflecting my question.&nbsp; This time you gave a conditional answer.&nbsp; You said &#8216;if&#8217;.&nbsp; I want an absolute answer.&nbsp; Do you think your breasts are pretty?&nbsp; ...And put your hands down, right now.�

I lowered my hands a little, crossing my forearms just below my breasts.&nbsp; �All right.&nbsp; Maybe I think they look nice enough.&nbsp; But that doesn&#8217;t mean I think everyone else would think they&#8217;re nice.&nbsp; I guess some people do.&nbsp; Other people probably don&#8217;t.�

The Skipper smiled.&nbsp; Then he said, �Do you wish your breasts were bigger?�&nbsp; He jiggled my breast with the paddle.

Frowning, I pushed the paddle away.&nbsp; �I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s any of your business.�

He set down the paddle and took up the martinet.&nbsp; �Take hold of edge of the counter behind you.�

He wanted to whip me on the front.&nbsp; Why would I submit to that?&nbsp; I crossed my arms over my chest.&nbsp; Yet&nbsp; on some level maybe I felt I deserved punishment after letting Ivy screw up my relationship with Rafiq.&nbsp; I said, �I can&#8217;t do it if you&#8217;re going to hit me on the breasts.�

�For now I&#8217;ll spare your girl flesh.�

I decided to do what he said.&nbsp; I uncrossed my arms and took hold of the counter behind me.&nbsp; He eyed me for several moments as I waited.&nbsp; His expression was buoyant.&nbsp; Finally he drew back the martinet.&nbsp; I grimaced in anticipation.

He lashed it across my stomach.&nbsp; �Mmgh.�&nbsp; I swallowed my vocalization.&nbsp; Then he lashed me again and continued at it, over and over.&nbsp; Wincing and squirming, I gasped loudly but tried to stifle my cries.

He had started in at the level just below my belly button and gradually worked upwards.&nbsp; They were hard, stingy strokes, applied with increasingly rapid succession.&nbsp; After about thirty strokes, he was still working on my ribs just below my breasts.&nbsp; Yelping and gasping with each stoke, I couldn&#8217;t take much more.&nbsp; My entire mid-section was stinging madly.

Finally he laid off.&nbsp; Panting, tears in my eyes, I let go of the counter edge and rubbed my burning ribs.&nbsp; I gasped,&nbsp; �Oh-my-god, what a sting!&nbsp; You&#8217;re whipping me so hard.�

�Pretty good, eh?&nbsp; And haven&#8217;t gotten to the best part,� he said, his breathing quickened with the exertion.&nbsp; �A little break, and then we&#8217;ll give your girl flesh the good whipping it needs.�

�Oh-my-god, please no.&nbsp; That whip stings too bad.�

�Yeah, we&#8217;ll put the sting to your titties.&nbsp; You want them whipped hard for not being good enough.�

�I do not.&nbsp; I never said they weren&#8217;t good enough.�

�Yeah.&nbsp; I asked if you thought they were big enough, and you got all bent out of shape.&nbsp; Obviously you have a problem.�

�I do not.&nbsp; My breasts are just fine the way they are.&nbsp; I never said there was anything the matter with my body.&nbsp; Mostly I just didn&#8217;t go along with your stuff about being proud.�

�Your lithe and supple body.&nbsp; The physical embodiment of the cool understatement&nbsp; ...shouted to the heavens.�

�You say the weirdest things.�

�No, it&#8217;s you that doesn&#8217;t talk sense.&nbsp; How can you have a body like that and tell me you&#8217;re not proud of it?�

�Oh,&nbsp; whatever.&nbsp; ...But there can&#8217;t be absolutes.&nbsp; Just this afternoon James insulted me.&nbsp; He said I needed a boob job.�

The Skipper laughed heartily.&nbsp; Feeling up my breast before I pushed his hand away, he said,&nbsp; �Jenny needs a boob job.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t know why it tickles me that he would insult you.&nbsp; ...It&#8217;s like a donkey spattering mud on the princess.&nbsp; But what do you think about a boob job?�

�I have no interest in getting one.�

�What, you don&#8217;t want your tits overstuffed with blobs of silicone till they look like water balloons about to burst?&nbsp;&nbsp; ...Well, how about this?&nbsp; What if there was some kind of wonder herb, known to be completely safe, and all you had to do is rub it on your tits, and they would grow one size bigger.&nbsp; Would you do it?�

�What a weird hypothetical,� I said, somewhat amused.&nbsp; �Well...&nbsp; If it were reversible, then why not?&nbsp; I could try it out.&nbsp; It would be an interesting change.�

�No, let&#8217;s say not reversible.&nbsp; Once you do it, it&#8217;s for keeps.�

�Well, I don&#8217;t know.&nbsp;&nbsp; ...Hmm&nbsp;&nbsp; ...But if it were completely safe, then maybe I would.�

�And that&#8217;s why you deserve the whipping I&#8217;m going to give you.&nbsp; You have a perfect body, and you don&#8217;t appreciate your good fortune.�

He went into his bag and pulled out some leather handcuffs.&nbsp; �Here.&nbsp; Give me your hands.&nbsp; We&#8217;ll put these on.&nbsp; It will make it easier for you.�

�Please no,� I whimpered, even as I offered my wrists.&nbsp; ...Yet he had them connected by a chain in front of me, so it seemed that he was not going to bind my wrists behind my back.&nbsp;&nbsp; And there was no apparent holdfast on the wall or ceiling with which to secure me, hands over head.&nbsp; I felt like I might be getting off easy.

Wrists bound together, I kept my arms over my breasts.&nbsp; My stomach and ribs were still stinging, but not so badly now.

�Okay, now kneel on the floor,� said the Skipper.&nbsp; �Your back against the counter, right here at the sink.�

I obeyed.&nbsp; Kneeling, I kept my cuffed wrists at my chest.

�Good girl.&nbsp; Now let&#8217;s have your wrists.�&nbsp; He took hold of the cuff chain and pulled my arms up and sharply back, securing the chain to the facet fixtures.&nbsp; He had me immobilized, wrists yanked far back behind my head, shoulder blades pressed against the cabinet and counter edge, chest thrust forward, breasts so vulnerable.

�Nice,� he said, as he admired his handiwork.&nbsp; He passed his hand over my breasts.&nbsp; Silently beseeching, I looked up into his eyes.&nbsp; He smiled and said, �Ah, such a cutie.�

Stroking my ribs and stomach, he said, �Kinda red.&nbsp; How does it feel now?�

�It still stings.&nbsp; You whipped me so hard.�

�And you took it so bravely.&nbsp; I admire your spunk.&nbsp; ...And there&#8217;s more to come.&nbsp; It&#8217;ll be a real workout.�

I sighed and closed my eyes.&nbsp;&nbsp; ...But quickly opened them as his hand glided below my stomach, slipping under the waist band of my shorts, into my panties, and toward my pussy.

�Please, sir,� I pleaded, squirming, as his finger probed my clit and then into my cleft.

As his finger probed the entrance to my vagina, he said, �You&#8217;re moist.&nbsp; Good girl.&nbsp; Shall we undress you the rest of the way?�&nbsp; He began pulling my shorts down.

I spread my knees to prevent that.&nbsp; �No, please sir.&nbsp;&nbsp; ...I&#8217;d feel so vulnerable.&nbsp; The way you got me tied up in here, you could anything.�&nbsp; Within the context of a disciplinarian, there is a degree of sexual contact that I had been accepting from the Skipper.&nbsp; But I did not want him to enter me, to actually have me sexually.

He eyed me for several moments as I looked up at him gravely.&nbsp; Then he said, �I&#8217;m the captain and chief medical officer.&nbsp; What do you imagine I would do, fornicate with my crew?&nbsp; I should punish you extra for implying such a thing.�

�I&#8217;m sorry sir.&nbsp; I didn&#8217;t mean disrespect.�&nbsp; At the time I took his stated disinterest at face value.&nbsp; But afterwards I thought it may have been a way for him to retreat while maintaining complete control of the situation.&nbsp; ...But whatever.

�This is highly irregular, but since you&#8217;re so prim, I&#8217;ll try to complete my medical examination while you&#8217;re clothed. �&nbsp; With that he removed his shoe and wedged it lengthwise between my knees, thus preventing me from closing my legs.&nbsp; Then he pushed aside the crotch of my shorts, then my panties, exposing my pussy.

I decided to keep silent.&nbsp; I had already indicated my limit.&nbsp; He had avowed no interest in exceeding it.&nbsp; This ordeal would go easier if I let myself flow with it.&nbsp; 

Again he probed at the entrance to my vagina with his fingers, without actually entering.&nbsp; Certainly I did not want to be finger fucked.&nbsp; But still, it was not the same as being actually fucked.&nbsp; I didn&#8217;t have the energy to try to redraw the parameters of my limits, even within my own mind.&nbsp; So I closed my eyes and just focused on the sensations of my body.

His fingers passed onto my clit.&nbsp; He began softly frigging me.&nbsp; Slight pressure, subtle motion.&nbsp; It was not unpleasant.&nbsp; I was sure he could tell that it was stimulating me, even though I tried to suppress overt responsiveness.

With his chief medical officer manner, he said, �I can detect some reflexive reaction.&nbsp; But for a&nbsp; vibrant young woman in her prime, your response to tactile stimulus seems weak.&nbsp; I think it&#8217;s best if I try physical therapeutics.�

Then he took up the martinet, and lashed me on the inside of the thigh.&nbsp; I gasped.&nbsp; It really stung.&nbsp; The inside of the thigh is more sensitive than you might think.

He continued lashing me.&nbsp; And I continued gasping and yelping with each stroke.&nbsp; He switched to&nbsp; the other thigh.&nbsp; Hard strokes, he was giving it everything he had.

Then he lashed it hard on my pussy.&nbsp; �AHHHH!&nbsp; Shit!&nbsp; Not there.�

But he lashed me again.&nbsp; Then again.&nbsp; Many times over.&nbsp; With his shoe wedged between my knees, shorts and panties pulled aside enough to expose my pussy, there was nothing I could do, kneeling there, back to the counter, wrists secured way back behind my head.

It must have been at least twenty hard strokes right on the pussy.&nbsp; Each one with lightning bolt intensity.&nbsp; By the time he stopped, I was crying in desperation.

While I knelt there gasping, tears in my eyes, trying to recover my equilibrium, he went into his bag and pulled out those loathsome nipple clips.&nbsp; While I squirmed in aversion, he clamped them onto my nipples, first the one, then the other.&nbsp; And both right onto the nub where it would hurt the most.&nbsp; The intensity was electric.&nbsp; I leaned my head back, mouth open, panting, engulfed in sensation.

But now he was feeling at my pussy again.&nbsp; He probed a finger at my vagina.&nbsp; This time he was going in.&nbsp; I could feel him slowly penetrating me, his long finger exploring my tunnel.

He frigged me for several moments.&nbsp; Subtle movements, his finger twitching on the forward wall of my vagina.&nbsp; Then slid his finger back out.&nbsp; Then back in again.&nbsp; Then back out.

Now he was going back into his bag again.&nbsp; By this point I had ceased wasting mental energy trying to anticipate what new ordeal I was in for next.&nbsp; But this time...&nbsp; surprise... it was the butterfly vibrator.

I had never experienced a vibrator before.&nbsp; I wasn&#8217;t sure whether it would be pleasurable or irritating.&nbsp; With the residual sting from my pussy whipping subsiding and my nipples beginning to acclimate to the bite of those little metal jaws, maybe I could actually enjoy it.

He went back into his bag again.&nbsp; Pulling out that double-length black wooden dildo, he asked, �You&#8217;re no stranger to this?�

Closing my eyes and turning my head away, I said nothing.

Touching the dildo to my mouth, he said, �Come on, open up.�&nbsp; Acquiescing, I opened my mouth and began sucking on it.&nbsp; He slid it in and out, turning round and round.&nbsp; Only once did he touch it to the back of my throat and elicit a gag reflex from me. 

After a couple minutes of me sucking on that dildo, he took it out.&nbsp; �Good girl.&nbsp; Now spit on it.�&nbsp; After I did so, he took it to my pussy, probed it to my vagina, and slowly slid it in.

Murmuring, �Oh...&nbsp; ooh,� I tried to relax as he penetrated it into me.&nbsp; ...Finally it was all the way in.&nbsp; He held it in me, impelling it with a subtle stirring motion.&nbsp; Not forcefully in and out with a grating friction that would inevitably become uncomfortable, but with a with a gentle rocking motion, the in-and-out too subtle to induce friction.&nbsp; 

In retrospect, I find it curious that he was selective in how he wanted me to experience pain.&nbsp; The acrid severity with which he applied the whip, paddle, and nipple clips, contrasts with the tempered fluidness with which he penetrated me with the dildo.

While he continued to work me with the dildo, he turned on the butterfly vibrator and applied it to my clit.&nbsp; What a peculiar sensation.&nbsp; A buzz so artificially electric, but with a steady tingling intensity that had to mean sexual arousal.

It was like the vibrator had bypassed all natural modes of stimulation, and found a direct conduit to my sexual nerve sensors.&nbsp; I felt I had lost a degree of experiential autonomy &#8211; with the flip of a switch, he could force my body to undergo erotic tingling.

He pulled the front part of the crotch of my panties over the vibrator to hold it in place, let the dildo rest in stiff silence within me, and took up the whip.&nbsp; �Now you get the thrashing you so richly deserve.�

Raising the martinet, he eyed me for a moment.&nbsp; Then he laid a hard stinging stroke across the base of my breasts.&nbsp;&nbsp; �Ooh!� I cried.&nbsp; The impact reawakened the bite of the nipple clips, to which I had become somewhat numb.
 
He continued with a hard stroke just above the nipples.&nbsp; �Ahhhh!�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ...Then another one below the nipples.&nbsp; �Oooh!&nbsp; God.�

He continued to rain whip strokes onto my breasts, a steady pattern above and below the nipples.&nbsp; I cried out with every stroke.

After maybe fifteen stinging strokes, he paused to feel up my breasts.&nbsp; Then taking them into his hands, he wrung them, but not badly.&nbsp; �Mmm, soft mounds.&nbsp; Squeeze the fat,� he murmured.&nbsp; Then with more force he tugged them back and forth while I gasped and winced.&nbsp; Then he yanked them upwards.&nbsp; Now it was getting unbearable.

Letting go of my breasts, he started diddling with the nipple clips, bobbing them back and forth, up and down, renewing their nettlesome bite.&nbsp; �Would you like me to free your nipples?� he asked.

I nodded yes, looking at him plaintively through the tears in my eyes.

�Ah.&nbsp; You&#8217;re a good girl,� he said, wiping away my tears.&nbsp; �Hey, I got one more idea.�&nbsp; Taking a dry dish towel, he wrapped it over my eyes, blindfolding me.

Closing off all visual stimuli seemed to magnify the tactile sensations.&nbsp; There I was, immobilized, knees on the floor, arms raked back behind my head, shoulder blades pressed against the cabinet, offering up my front to be punished.&nbsp; My nipples pinched fiercely in clips, the rest of my breasts were stinging from the prior whip strokes, my stomach and ribs now less so.&nbsp; Last but certainly not least was that steady electro-erotic buzzing in my nether region, and the big hard dildo stuffed into me.

The Skipper again bobbed the nipple clips back and forth for a few moments.&nbsp; When that stopped, I could hear him combing and shaking out the strands of the martinet.

After a pause, there was the swoosh of the martinet.&nbsp; A split second later I felt it flay onto my right breast, plucking off the nipple clip.&nbsp; �EEEEEE�, I let out a scream.

Straightaway the lash came down hard on my other breast, and off came that nipple clip, clacking onto the floor.&nbsp; �EEEEEE�, I screamed again.&nbsp; �My nipples!&nbsp; Oh fuck, that hurt!�

He responded to that by lashing me again across the breasts, right onto my anguished nipples.&nbsp; Then again.&nbsp; And again.

He continued to score my breasts with the whip, one hard stroke after another.&nbsp; Smarting, searing, scorching.

Shlack!&nbsp; A burning sting to my breasts.&nbsp; I cry out.&nbsp; I pant.&nbsp;&nbsp; ...Just as I begin to recover from its lightning ferocity, along comes another.&nbsp; Shlack!&nbsp; Another fiery sting to my breasts.

I don&#8217;t really know how long this went on.&nbsp; The steady rhythm of whip strokes was hypnotic.&nbsp; My nipples burned like glowing coals.&nbsp; Yet the electro-mechanical buzzing of my clitoris and the hard-shaft stuffing of my vagina turned the whole thing into an experience of powerful sexual arousal.&nbsp; I knew that if this kept on I would end up coming off.

My psyche was unhinged.&nbsp; Now I reveled in the chagrin of being bared, kneeling with breasts thrust out and legs open, flogged to submission.&nbsp; Reveled in the humiliation of surrendering my womenhood to be exploited with perverse devices.&nbsp; Reveled in the debasement of being a good girl brought low to become a creature of depraved sexual desire, impelled toward orgasm through ill use by an older man.

The intensity of the physical sensations, pain and pleasure, was overwhelming.&nbsp; I was swept into an alternate reality where I craved the energy the Skipper was pouring into my body.

My brimming sexual arousal could be contained no more.&nbsp; Beginning as a rivulet, it swelled into a raging torrent surging through every element of my being, obliterating everything in its path.&nbsp; Reducing my existence to one element, raw orgasmic energy.

Moaning with ecstacy, my body quivering, pulsating, throbbing with the fury of surging essence of animalistic pleasure, I strained in my bonds, trying to capture all of the trenchant force of the whip, the staunch firmness of the dildo, and the galvanizing amperage of the vibrator.

On and on I rode this torrent of energy, swimming through infinite time, immersed in ecstacy.&nbsp; It was a never-ending orgasm.&nbsp; All matter vanished, and time became no time.&nbsp; My existence was an all-embracing sexual exhilaration.

But no-time does not mean forever.&nbsp; As the flood of sexual energy gradually slackened and trickled to quiescence, I relaxed in my bonds.&nbsp; The Skipper had stopped whipping me.&nbsp; He removed the vibrator, but left the dildo in me.

When he removed my blindfold and released the chain securing my wrists behind my head, I sank to the floor, holding my sting-tingling breasts in my hands and murmuring a breathy �Oh-my-god.&nbsp; Oh-my-god.�&nbsp; With half of the double-ended dildo sticking out of me, I found a sideways position to sit.

Leaning against the opposite wall, breathing heavily, the Skipper sank down by me.&nbsp; �What a girl.&nbsp; What an extraordinary creature you are.�

I said nothing.&nbsp; I guess I was just staring off into space, in dreamy euphoria.&nbsp; I was vaguely aware that there were gooey gobs of cum seeping down the right side of my body.&nbsp; Sometime during my own orgasmic frenzy, the Skipper had shot his load onto me.&nbsp; ...Whatever.&nbsp; ...I got mine: that&#8217;s all that really registered.

We sat in silent reverie for a long time.&nbsp; Whenever I glanced at him, his eyes were soaking up my body.&nbsp; Not with apparent lust, but with what seemed like satisfied admiration.

Finally, it seemed like time for the dildo to go.&nbsp; Did I need permission to take it out?&nbsp; No, I quickly resolved the choice to be mine.&nbsp; I slowly eased it outwards.&nbsp; With a keen tingle the end slipped out.

I glanced at the Skipper.&nbsp; He had an amused expression on his face.&nbsp; I adjusted the crotch of my panties and shorts to cover myself.&nbsp; He picked up the dildo, and looking at me with a twinkle in his eye, he brought it to his nose and sniffed its length as if it were a cigar and he a connoisseur.&nbsp; ...In retrospect, I am amused by his show.&nbsp; But at the time, I thought it a bit weird.

The handcuffs being connected by a foot-long chain, such that I could undo them myself, I began to release my wrists.&nbsp; I said, �You dished it out really hard.&nbsp; I hope you realize that.�

�I gave you what you needed.&nbsp; You&#8217;re satisfied, I hope.�

�It&#8217;s you I hope is satisfied.&nbsp; What you were doing to me, you could have, like, fried my sensory system.&nbsp; Not to mention flayed off my skin.�

�How do you like that whip?&nbsp; Does it sting enough?&nbsp; It doesn&#8217;t mark you up too bad.&nbsp; Subtle welting, but nice and red.�

�Oh-my-god, yes, it stings enough.&nbsp; You whipped me so hard, right where it would hurt the most,� I said, nestling my whip-scored breasts with one hand and my pussy with the other.

�Well-whipped tits and pussy.&nbsp; That&#8217;s what I like,� he replied. �Now do you realize you have a dream body?�

I watched the thoughts of self consciousness and resistance arise in my mind.&nbsp; I decided let them pass unheeded.&nbsp; To have a body... to have a dream body... maybe they&#8217;re the same thing.&nbsp; No problem.

I smiled and just said, �Yes.�

Seeing his expression of surprise and consternation, I quickly asked, �Did I say something wrong? Didn&#8217;t I just get punished for not accepting that I had ...like, what you call a dream body?�

�Well...&nbsp; Do you think you&#8217;re better than others?�

�No, of course not.&nbsp; How could physical appearance do that, no matter what you looked like?&nbsp; Even so, lots of women are really nice looking, and all in different ways.�

�It would be unbecoming to think of yourself as better than others.&nbsp; Your anxieties are part of your charm.�

�Well , considering how badly my romantic affairs are going, I have no shortage of anxieties.�

The Skipper laughed and said, �So you&#8217;re not sure you&#8217;re as charming as Ivy.�

�I don&#8217;t know what it is.&nbsp; But I don&#8217;t like being in competition with her.&nbsp; ...She&#8217;s so ...polished ...like, high society.&nbsp; ...She&#8217;s so confident.�

�And you lack confidence&nbsp; ...except in bookish domains.&nbsp; Poor Jenny.&nbsp; You feel inexperienced.&nbsp; Is that right?�

�Yeah.�

�Not sure if you&#8217;re as pretty as Ivy?�

�Well... maybe not.&nbsp; But maybe it&#8217;s not that big an issue.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t know.�

�Should not be an issue.&nbsp; ...But anyway, you&#8217;re not pleased that Rock and Ivy are out there together.&nbsp; And you&#8217;re stuck in here with an older guy.�

I smiled and said, �Why don&#8217;t we just leave it that I&#8217;m not happy about the situation with Rafiq.�

�Even after all of this... what did I call it... physical therapeutics, you still feel bad?�

�No.&nbsp; Actually I feel pretty good.&nbsp; It was you, not me, who brought up the subject of my anxieties.�

�So I did.&nbsp; ...So the physical therapeutics had a curative effect, is that right?�

�Physical therapeutics?&nbsp; What a bogus term.&nbsp; You just whipped the shit out of me.&nbsp; And frigged and fucked me with weird objects.&nbsp; ...First you trick me into saying that I might not mind changing how I look, then you punish me for it.&nbsp; Then you say I have a dream body, and if I agree, you get down on me for sounding haughty.&nbsp; No matter what I say, I&#8217;m always wrong.�

�Oh, well...&nbsp; So I&#8217;m not consistent.&nbsp; It keeps you on your toes, so you&#8217;re always at your best.&nbsp; ...But still, you just said you were feeling pretty good now.&nbsp; Doesn&#8217;t that mean that you&#8217;re feeling better after our therapeutic regimen?�

�Well, I do feel okay now.&nbsp; It was a nice release,� I admitted.&nbsp; I did not care to reveal that he had brought about the most unimaginably mind-blowing orgasm.&nbsp; It didn&#8217;t seem right that I should be that sexually responsive to the Skipper.&nbsp; Rafiq was the one I wanted.

�That&#8217;s good.&nbsp; You certainly appeared to have a good strong orgasm.�

�All right.&nbsp; That&#8217;s true.&nbsp; But I&#8217;m not going to say anything good about your dumb therapeutics, because it&#8217;ll just encourage you to keep doing it.�

�So what&#8217;s the matter with that?�

�I don&#8217;t want any more.&nbsp; I can still feel the sting.&nbsp; Do you know how hard you were whipping me?&nbsp; And right where I don&#8217;t want to be whipped.�

�You mean on the tits and pussy.&nbsp; And you took it so bravely,� he said, with a dreamy expression on his face.&nbsp; �...But of course we wouldn&#8217;t do any more today.&nbsp; Who&#8217;s got that kind of energy?&nbsp; But why not a daily regimen to keep you feeling at your peak?�

�You mean a daily whipping?&nbsp; No way!�

�Why not?&nbsp; You agree it makes you feel really good.�

�It does not.&nbsp; It really hurts.�

�But it gives you so much pleasure and satisfaction.&nbsp; Your aura is glowing right now.�

�That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s so fucked up.&nbsp; It isn&#8217;t right to have... you know... like a sexual experience during corporal punishment.&nbsp; It&#8217;s so degrading.�

�You don&#8217;t look degraded.&nbsp; You look radiant.�

�I do not.�

�Yes, you do.&nbsp; Don&#8217;t you feel radiant?�

�Well...&nbsp; I felt fine until you started talking about making me do this every day.&nbsp; It&#8217;s bad enough that everyone could hear what was going on in here now.&nbsp; They&#8217;d really think I was fucked up if I let this happen every day.�

�No, they&#8217;d think you were really cool.&nbsp; ...And besides, what do you care what they think?&nbsp; A smart girl like you, don&#8217;t you think for yourself?�

�Yes...&nbsp;&nbsp; No...&nbsp; Maybe I don&#8217;t care that much what they think.&nbsp; It&#8217;s just... well... it&#8217;s still really screwed up for me to submit to something like this every day.&nbsp; It seems harmful psychologically ...and physically too.�

�Hmm... physically too?&nbsp; Like, your silky smooth breasts would get all leathery from whip welts?&nbsp; That would be gross.�

�I glad we agree on something.�

�Well, maybe we wouldn&#8217;t want to lash your breasts every day.&nbsp; I could whack you straight onto the nipples instead, say with a ruler or belt or something.&nbsp; That wouldn&#8217;t show.&nbsp; ...And inside your pussy lips.�

�Are you out of your mind?&nbsp; Don&#8217;t you think those parts of my body have a purpose, other than being beaten?&nbsp; If you&#8217;re trying to freak me out, you&#8217;re doing a pretty good job of it.�

Laughing, the Skipper said, �Your indignation is cute.&nbsp; You take everything I say so seriously.�

�I wish you&#8217;d start taking a few things I say seriously.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t want to be made to enjoy being tied up, whipped, or ill used anymore.&nbsp; It&#8217;s too perverted.&nbsp; It&#8217;s going to turn me into something I don&#8217;t want to be.�

�Is that what you meant when you said &#8216;psychologically harmful&#8217;?�

�Yes, it is.&nbsp; I&#8217;m going to end up addicted to rough treatment, unable to respond normally to loving tenderness.�

As the Skipper eyed me silently, I began to worry that what I just said could have sounded like an romantic invitation.&nbsp; Although I accepted him as a disciplinarian, I did not want him to approach me as a lover.

I thought I better equivocate.&nbsp; �Well, I don&#8217;t know.&nbsp; Maybe I&#8217;m making too big a deal about it.&nbsp; But it&#8217;s hard for me to accept that I feel so good after getting that kind of punishment.�

�Well, I&#8217;m being careful to make it a good experience for you.&nbsp; I&#8217;m really appreciating what a special person you are.&nbsp; ...But don&#8217;t interpret that as a come-on.&nbsp; Rock is your guy.�

�I wish he were.&nbsp; But how come he&#8217;s with Ivy now?�

�Well, the first I&#8217;ve seen Ivy in really long time was a year ago, and she was with Rock then.&nbsp; ...You know I&#8217;m a first cousin to April&#8217;s father.&nbsp; April&#8217;s mother and Ivy&#8217;s father are cousins.&nbsp; So I&#8217;m not related to Ivy, just some kind of distant in-law.�

�Yeah, April mentioned what your relationship was.&nbsp; ...She says you wouldn&#8217;t dare discipline her.�

The Skipper looked uncomfortable.&nbsp; Then he said, �Well... April doesn&#8217;t do anything wrong.&nbsp; She doesn&#8217;t need to be disciplined.�

�So what have I done wrong?&nbsp; I don&#8217;t know why I keep getting punished.�

�Well...&nbsp; Let me try and remember why you&#8217;ve been disciplined.�

�First you whipped me for burning dinner.&nbsp; With that awful cat-o-nine-tails with those hard knots.&nbsp; That hurt so bad.&nbsp; And left ugly marks.�

�Oh, that&#8217;s a bad whip.&nbsp; Whoever made that thing didn&#8217;t know what the hell they were doing.&nbsp; My philosophy is that you got to be able to snap the whip hard.&nbsp; If you can&#8217;t do that without hurting the girl too bad, then it&#8217;s the wrong whip.&nbsp; ...But still, you took it like a real heroine.&nbsp; And those marks it left weren&#8217;t that ugly; they were kind of pretty.�

�Well anyway, then Ivy and me got strapped and caned and switched when she picked a fight with me.�

�How do you feel about that?�

�Well.&nbsp; I feel okay about that.&nbsp; I&#8217;m glad Ivy got the same as me.�

�It made peace, didn&#8217;t it.&nbsp; I mean, you and Ivy still like to bicker, but before you shared that whipping, the atmosphere on this boat was absolutely poisonous.�

�Well, the poison was coming from her, not me.�

Scowling at me, the Skipper said, �Don&#8217;t put on that goody-goody act.&nbsp; You put the moves on Rock and broke up their relationship.�

�I did not.&nbsp; ...I mean ...um, well ... Rafiq and I fell for each other.&nbsp; I realize that what happened created problems&nbsp; ...caused Ivy a lot of distress.&nbsp; But I didn&#8217;t set out to do that.&nbsp; It just happened.�

�What do you mean, just happened?&nbsp; You were putting the moves on Rock from the beginning, and the next thing we know, you&#8217;re up on the bow and having him take off your top and play with your tits.�

�Oh-my-god, no...&nbsp; You&#8217;re just trying to make it sound disgusting,� I stammered.&nbsp; �That&#8217;s so unfair.&nbsp; I wasn&#8217;t trying to put the moves on Rafiq.&nbsp; I swear I had no romantic designs on him in those first days.&nbsp; I thought of him only as a friend, and he and Ivy as a couple.&nbsp; ...I&#8217;m convinced that if I had been seeking a romantic relationship &#8211; what you call putting the moves on Rafiq &#8211; none of this ever would have happened.&nbsp;&nbsp; I would have been so self conscious and uptight about whether Rafiq liked me that I could never have charmed him.�

Smiling, the Skipper said, �Oh.&nbsp; That does fit you.�

�I was as surprised as anyone when Rafiq ...um ...started caressing me that day on the bow.�

�All right.&nbsp; I can believe that.&nbsp; Anyway, that whipping with Ivy had a good effect, didn&#8217;t it.�

�Well, the outcome was okay.&nbsp; But the experience itself was really hard.&nbsp; ...But I can sort of connect with the intensity of it.�

�That one was rough.&nbsp; Ivy&#8217;s way of putting the switch to your tits was a bit beyond the right way to do it.&nbsp;&nbsp; But anyway, after those first two, you&#8217;ve been turned on by every whipping you&#8217;ve got, haven&#8217;t you?&nbsp; When you volunteered to have Rock whip you in place of Ivy.&nbsp; ...And tonight.&nbsp;&nbsp; ...And&nbsp; ...And that&#8217;s all there is.&nbsp; My god, you&#8217;re not getting whipped enough.�

�I am so.&nbsp; That&#8217;s a lot.&nbsp; And there&#8217;s also the time you and Rafiq ganged up on me when I had those clips on me.�

�Oh yeah.&nbsp; Tit torture.&nbsp; You like that.�

�I do not.&nbsp; I think I&#8217;m more sensitive that way than some other women might be.&nbsp; For me it&#8217;s really hard.�

�Getting your nipples pinched?�

�Yeah.&nbsp; It hurts.�

�Well, tell me how it felt tonight when I whacked your nipple clips off with the whip?�&nbsp; As he asked, he reached over and gathered off the floor the two nipple clips he spoke of.

�Couldn&#8217;t you tell it really hurt?&nbsp; How loud do I have to screech for you to understand that?�

�Well, sure I noticed it got a good reaction from you.&nbsp; But I thought you might be able to articulate now just how it felt.�

�Well what&#8217;s an articulate person supposed to say?&nbsp; Are there big words for saying it felt like my nipples got torn off?�

Laughing, the Skipper said, �That&#8217;s good enough.&nbsp; Small words are strong.�&nbsp; After eyeing me for a few moments, he took the dish cloth blindfold and wiped the drying cum off my body.

Then he yawned and said, �Well, Jenny, you know, it&#8217;s been a really satisfying evening.&nbsp; You took your punishment like a true heroine.&nbsp; Brave.&nbsp; Strong.&nbsp; Beautiful.&nbsp; ...But it&#8217;s getting late, and I have the morning watch.�&nbsp; He got up and began putting his implements back in the bag.

Remaining where I was, I said, �Yes, it is getting late.&nbsp; But tell me.&nbsp; Do you think Rafiq just views me as somebody to have fling with, and forget about after this voyage is over?�

�Ooh, that&#8217;s a tough one.�&nbsp; The Skipper knitted his brow.&nbsp; �Being out here on a boat like this is a special time.&nbsp; Things happen between people that might not otherwise happen.&nbsp; ...But still, you two share a lot, a good match intellectually.�

After a pause he continued, �But you&#8217;re not oriented toward high society like Ivy, and with his father being a diplomat, I understand that Rafiq has some level of comfort in those circles, although you won&#8217;t know it seeing him out here.�

�When he&#8217;s mentioned that to me, he&#8217;s very dismissive of it.�

�Probably so.&nbsp; ...Anyway, how important is it that this last beyond the voyage?�

�I don&#8217;t know.&nbsp; Part of me says that the relationship needs to be exclusive and forever.&nbsp; That I can&#8217;t share him with Ivy.&nbsp; Another part of me says that I should enjoy the moment, and that worrying about the future will just screw it up.�

�Well, it seems that you have it figured out.�

�But it bothers me that he&#8217;s with Ivy now.&nbsp; Do you think I should approach him, or wait for him to approach me?�

Unlocking the door, the Skipper said, �This boat is crowded enough that we can&#8217;t avoid spending a lot of time together.&nbsp; I think you&#8217;re overanalyzing this thing.&nbsp; ...One thing I&#8217;ll tell you, Jenny.&nbsp; You&#8217;re a damn fool if you don&#8217;t realize how attractive you are ...in every way.&nbsp; ...Now good night.�

�Good night.&nbsp; And thank you.&nbsp;&nbsp; ...Sir.�











Chapter 7.&nbsp; Entering the Ring

After the Skipper left, I remained sitting on the floor of the galley.&nbsp; Still topless, I checked over my front, which was still feeling stingy from the whipping.&nbsp; In spite of how it felt, the visual evidence of whip marks was disappearing.

I guess it seemed a little anticlimactic to have nothing to show after such intense punishment.&nbsp; Not that I&#8217;m complaining &#8211; it upsets me to be badly marked up, as I had been after my run-in with that cat-o-nine-tails early in the voyage.

I didn&#8217;t especially want anyone to come by and see me without my shirt on.&nbsp; But at the moment I didn&#8217;t care enough to actually do something to prevent it &#8211; like either putting my shirt on or getting up and closing the door.

I heard footsteps approaching.&nbsp; It wasn&#8217;t heavy enough to be James, the only one I definitely did not want to see me topless.&nbsp; I looked to the doorway in anticipation.

It was April.&nbsp; �Hi,� she said.&nbsp; �Sounded like quite a session.�

�Uh...&nbsp; Well, yeah.&nbsp; I guess it was.�

�You don&#8217;t look the worse for wear.�

�I&#8217;m fine.&nbsp; But...&nbsp; What did it sound like?�

April sat on the floor next to me and said, �Like you were being swatted with something really loud, and then something not so loud.�

�Yeah, first a wooden paddle.&nbsp; Then a martinet whip.�

�Sounded like you were really into it.�

�April, I know you&#8217;re just shitting me again.�

She laughed and said, �Well sort of.&nbsp; At times it sounded pretty heavy.&nbsp; But you came off in the end, didn&#8217;t you?�

�How do you know that?�

�Well, weren&#8217;t you moaning with pleasure?�

�Were you right outside the door listening or something?�

�No, I wasn&#8217;t.&nbsp; You know how these walls are.�

�Well, he put that vibrator on me.&nbsp; It&#8217;s really gross.&nbsp; Eventually I couldn&#8217;t help coming off.&nbsp; I didn&#8217;t want to.�

�Of course not,� she teased, laughing.&nbsp; �So anyway, what all was he doing to you?�

�Well...&nbsp; You want to know everything?&nbsp; First he paddled me on the butt.&nbsp; Then he threatened to paddle me on the breasts.�

�Did you let him?�

�No.&nbsp; But he got me kneeling, back against the counter, wrists bound behind my head, put clips on my nipples, and then whipped me with a martinet.&nbsp; It was lightweight but real stingy.&nbsp; And it really hurt when he knocked the clips off.�

�And all this because you wouldn&#8217;t let him paddle your tits?�

�No.&nbsp; He was asking all these weird questions about, like, whether I wished I had bigger tits.&nbsp; He didn&#8217;t think I gave the right answer, so that&#8217;s when he whipped me really hard on the front and between the legs.�

�What a fucking asshole.&nbsp; He whipped you to try to make you say you wanted big tits?&nbsp; That prick.&nbsp; I ought to go give him a piece of my mind, right now.�

�Oh...&nbsp; But it wasn&#8217;t quite like that.&nbsp; I sort of said that I wouldn&#8217;t mind having bigger tits.&nbsp; And that&#8217;s why he whipped me.&nbsp; He said I already had a dream body.�

April looked at me in surprise.&nbsp; �I didn&#8217;t know you weren&#8217;t satisfied with yourself.�

I felt diminished in her eyes.&nbsp; �Well...&nbsp; It was only about going from an A to a B size.�

April said, �Oh.&nbsp; That&#8217;s no big deal.&nbsp; Probably everyone wouldn&#8217;t mind being a little different from what they are.&nbsp; I wouldn&#8217;t mind being thinner.�

�Yeah.&nbsp; Well, anyway, he also stuck that big dildo in me.�

�Was he rough with it?�

�No.&nbsp; He was real good with it.&nbsp; It wasn&#8217;t punishment.&nbsp; ...Then he put that vibrator on me.&nbsp; It&#8217;s really weird.&nbsp; The sensation is so... electric.&nbsp; But so stimulating...�

�James borrowed it and used it on me.&nbsp; I know what you&#8217;re talking about.&nbsp; It is strange.�

�Anyway, I did end up coming off.&nbsp; ...I&#8217;m sort of freaked out that I&#8217;m getting, like, acclimated to responding sexually to this kind of treatment.&nbsp; What if I end up unresponsive to normal tender contact?�

�Do you think that could happen?�

�I don&#8217;t know.&nbsp; It&#8217;s just that the climax is so intense.�

April put her arm around me.&nbsp; I responded in kind.&nbsp; She kissed me on the cheek, a prolonged kiss.&nbsp; Although I hugged her in return, I did not turn my head to meet my lips to hers.

In retrospect, I think I just wasn&#8217;t in the mood for a lot of affectionate contact.&nbsp; But at the time, I took it as evidence that I had become unresponsive to a gentle touch.

In the face of my lukewarm response, April did not persist.&nbsp; Loosening her embrace, she said, �Jenny, you&#8217;ve always been such a worrier.�

�I know.&nbsp; So many things to worry about.&nbsp; Now I&#8217;m worried about Rafiq and Ivy.&nbsp; I really don&#8217;t like her competing with me for his attention.�

�God, I hate being in the middle of this thing.&nbsp; You should never have come on to Rafiq in the first place the way you did.&nbsp; But I know I&#8217;ve told you that before, and what good is it now anyway.&nbsp; What&#8217;s done is done.&nbsp; You&#8217;ve made things so messy, I don&#8217;t know what you should do.&nbsp; I know you can&#8217;t just forget about Rafiq now.�

�No, I can&#8217;t.&nbsp; ...But what would you think about me going out there and hanging out with both of them now?�

�Maybe.&nbsp; ...Like, Rafiq with one arm around each of you.&nbsp; Is that the image?

�I guess.�

�And Ivy would come around when you think you have Rafiq to yourself?&nbsp; That&#8217;s okay too?�

�Hmm...&nbsp; I guess that would be the implication.&nbsp; I wonder what that would be like.�

�I don&#8217;t know.&nbsp; I&#8217;ve never been in that situation.&nbsp; ...And it&#8217;s not like Ivy&#8217;s your twin sister.&nbsp; You two squabble a lot.�

�Well, some.&nbsp; But it&#8217;s not that bad.�&nbsp; After a few moments, I withdrew my arm from around April, and said, �I don&#8217;t know what I&#8217;m going to do, but thanks for coming by to see how I was.�&nbsp; Actually, I knew exactly what I was going to do.

As soon as April got up and left, I too got up, intending to go check out Rafiq and Ivy.&nbsp; As I started to put my shirt back on, the option of remaining shirtless occurred to me.&nbsp; For me, that seems risque.&nbsp; But I pondered the pros and cons.

The pros...&nbsp; April and Ivy fairly often go topless &#8211; in the sun.&nbsp; So what if it&#8217;s after dark now, why shouldn&#8217;t I too?&nbsp; No need for me to hold on to my hang-ups.&nbsp; And with my build, I&#8217;m the least obtrusive female to go topless.

The cons...&nbsp; With my build... well, let&#8217;s not go there; after all, Rafiq and Skipper both think I look good.&nbsp; As for James and his insults, well screw him.&nbsp; Although I&#8217;d still feel uncomfortable going topless around him, he wasn&#8217;t even out there.

After the number of times I had been forced to strip in front of all the people on board, it might seem strange that I would have any reluctance to go topless.&nbsp; But being forced to strip just means you&#8217;re eager to get your clothes back on.&nbsp; And once back on, you&#8217;re just as reluctant as ever to take them off again.

Obviously, the reason for going out there topless was to get Rafiq&#8217;s attention.&nbsp; And since I had just been whipped, I had a good reason to be shirtless.&nbsp; But as I looked myself over, I was disappointed that I had so little marking to show for it.&nbsp; Well, this would have to do.&nbsp; Let&#8217;s hope Rafiq would still be sympathetic.

Nevertheless, I considered that this might be viewed as a transparent and pathetic ploy for getting attention, such that Rafiq might be grossed out with me.&nbsp; Well, whatever.&nbsp; Nothing ventured, nothing gained.

I left my shirt on the counter in the galley and went out onto the deck.&nbsp; High in the sky, the waxing, three-quarter full moon illuminated everything.&nbsp; Rafiq and Ivy were nestled together at the helm.&nbsp; Although I had expected that, still my psyche winced at the sight.

I did not approach them.&nbsp; Instead, I went to the side and looked out onto the moon-lit sea.&nbsp; I didn&#8217;t have to wait long.&nbsp; Rafiq approached and asked, �Heyyy...&nbsp; Are you okay?&nbsp; We could hear you getting swatted in there.�

Turning toward Rafiq I said, �Yeah, first he paddled my butt.&nbsp; Then he whipped me on the front.�&nbsp; I rubbed my hands over my front, especially over my breasts.

Mesmerized, Rafiq never took his eyes off my body.&nbsp; Placing his hands on my hips, he held me for a moment, then glided his hands up the sides of my body, coming to rest at the sides of my breasts.&nbsp; His thumbs passed over my nipples.&nbsp; I put my hands on his shoulders, letting him have my breasts.

I sighed, �He whipped me with a martinet ...really hard on the breasts.�&nbsp; But from the breathy way it came out, I wasn&#8217;t sure whether it sounded more like an expression of contentment than of complaint.

Rafiq only murmured, �Ah,� conveying neither positive nor negative connotation.&nbsp; He continued feeling me up.

Meanwhile Ivy had also come over, her expression icy.&nbsp; She said, �I think you got off easy.&nbsp; He could have whipped your pussy too.�

Rafiq glanced at her, removed his hand from my right breast, put his arm around her waist and pulled her close.&nbsp; His other hand remained on my left breast, his thumb pressing my nipple deeply, stirring in circular motion.

I replied to Ivy, �The Skipper did whip me on the pussy.&nbsp; Really hard too.�&nbsp; I tried to sound aggrieved.

For a moment her expression turned even more acrid.&nbsp; Then she said, �After all that, you must be really horny now.�&nbsp; She touched my right breast, then took hold of my nipple, firmly, but not pinching hard enough to really hurt.&nbsp; She gave a slight twist and held, all the while watching my expression.

I looked at Rafiq, and said plaintively, �After all I&#8217;ve been through tonight, she wants to torture me more.�

Ivy pinched a little harder.&nbsp; I gasped loudly, exaggerating how much she was actually hurting me.&nbsp; But I offered no resistance, closing my eyes and thrusting my chest forward as if to let her do her worst, but in the process pressing myself into Rafiq.

Her hand pressed between Rafiq and me, Ivy now pinched really hard.&nbsp; I cried out, �Ow!&nbsp; She&#8217;s hurting me.�

�Ivy, let her go,� Rafiq declared.

I gasped loudly as she yanked hard before releasing my nipple.&nbsp; But well satisfied that he had intervened on my behalf, I hugged Rafiq as I said, �She wants to hurt my tits.�

�I was barely touching you, you phoney.�

�Oh shit,� said Rafiq.&nbsp; �Do you two have to start with all this stuff again?�

�I never started anything.&nbsp; The Skipper just gave me a terrible whipping.&nbsp; And when I finally get away from him, Ivy wants to hurt me even more.�

�You&#8217;re so full of shit, Jenny,� said Ivy.&nbsp; �You come traipsing around without your shirt on, trying to get attention...�

�I am not.&nbsp; The Skipper took my shirt away.&nbsp; He made me bare myself in front of him again.&nbsp; Then whipped me really hard, right where it would hurt the most.&nbsp; I thought he would never stop.&nbsp; When I came out here, I thought maybe I might get a little comfort.&nbsp; I&#8217;m sorry I disturbed you.&nbsp; Please don&#8217;t be mad at me.�

�Oh, what a sob story.&nbsp; The poor little girl has lost her shirt.&nbsp; Here, you can wear my top,� said Ivy, removing her bikini top.

Rafiq was smiling, probably delighted by having his arms around two bare-breasted girls.

�I don&#8217;t want your top.&nbsp; It wouldn&#8217;t fit right.�

�Jenny with no tits, you&#8217;re right, it wouldn&#8217;t fit.�

Looking up into Rafiq&#8217;s face as I continued hugging him, I said, �Listen to how mean she talks to me.&nbsp; What is it that I should deserve that?�

Although I really do value peace, I was not unhappy about the way the interactions were going.&nbsp; If Ivy wanted to be a bitch in front of Rafiq, let her.&nbsp; I might be able to play out enough rope for her to hang herself.

Rafiq said, �No tits?&nbsp; Ivy, that&#8217;s just...&nbsp; First of all, it&#8217;s obviously not accurate.&nbsp; And second, it&#8217;s obnoxious.&nbsp; ...But I realize you&#8217;re pissed at Jenny.�

�Well shouldn&#8217;t I be?&nbsp; We spend a little time together now and so Jenny has to come running out topless to try to grab your attention.&nbsp; ...And of course she succeeds.�

�Well, um...� said Rafiq.

�Do I do that when you and Jenny are together?� said Ivy.

Rafiq looked at Ivy soberly for a moment.&nbsp; Then he said, �Ivy, do you really want me to answer that question?�

A faint smile crossed Ivy&#8217;s face.&nbsp; �Oh.&nbsp; I didn&#8217;t realize you had noticed.�

Whoa!&nbsp; There had been stuff going on that I was not aware of.&nbsp; This had to mean that Rafiq had been captivated by Ivy&#8217;s nude sunbathing while I was with him.&nbsp; How could I have been so blind?

Rafiq glanced into my eyes.&nbsp; I&#8217;m sure my expression communicated that I was not happy.&nbsp; Looking pained, he said, �You know, I would&#8217;ve thought that loving two exceedingly beautiful women would be some kind of dream.&nbsp; Instead the whole thing is some kind of bummer.&nbsp; I care about both of you, but neither of you can accept that I have feelings for the other.�

When he said that, I felt that I had let him down.&nbsp; The effect of my competitiveness with Ivy was to make him unhappy ...and unhappy with me.&nbsp; Certainly I should be able to come to terms that Ivy&#8217;s well-being is important to him.

And yet in the back of my mind I had a sense that this triangle could not persist indefinitely.&nbsp; Although I could share Rafiq with Ivy for a while, ultimately this is not what I wanted.&nbsp; If Rafiq was the one who was meant for me, then I would have to become his one and only.

Ivy said, �Rafiq, how come when I happened to sunbathe topless, you didn&#8217;t come racing over like you just did for Jenny?�

�I just came over to ask Jenny if she was okay after her session with the Skipper.&nbsp; I didn&#8217;t go &#8216;racing&#8217; over to her because she was topless.&nbsp; What do you take me for?�

�Rafiq, after all this time, don&#8217;t you think I know you?�

A guilty smile passed over his face and he replied, �Well, I admit I love tits, but still, Jenny just got whipped.&nbsp; Isn&#8217;t it natural to ask her if she&#8217;s okay?�

After several moments of silence, Ivy said, �I&#8217;m sorry I&#8217;m making a scene about this.&nbsp; I just get upset with both of you.�

�It&#8217;s my fault that I made you upset, Ivy,� I replied.&nbsp; I had to match her in conciliation.

�How about if I bring us some wine?� asked Ivy.&nbsp; As she separated from Rafiq&#8217;s embrace, I likewise separated from him, sensing it otherwise to be like stealing his affection.

As she when down the steps into the cabin, Rafiq and I contemplated the moonlit ocean silently.&nbsp; I was basking in the thought that a few moments previous, he had referred to me as an exceedingly beautiful woman.&nbsp; That Rafiq&#8217;s accolade was shared with Ivy is no problem, since Ivy is a dazzler, at least physically.

But almost as soon as Ivy disappeared below, she returned, stomping up the steps.&nbsp; �Is this the shirt you claim the Skipper stole from you?�&nbsp; She threw it at me.

Oh shit.&nbsp; I had left it on the galley counter.&nbsp; For a second my mind raced to come up with some explanation for my apparent deceit.&nbsp; Better not risk it.&nbsp; Better come clean.

�I&#8217;m really sorry.&nbsp; I just wanted some comfort after the Skipper got finished with me.�&nbsp; It&#8217;s so humiliating to be caught lying, my voice was tremulous.

Rafiq looked confused.&nbsp; �Am I missing something?&nbsp; Do people actually need an explanation for why they don&#8217;t wear a shirt?�

�Well, it makes it look like I was just trying to get your attention.�

�But I like giving you attention.&nbsp; Both of you.&nbsp; And what a sweet way to get my attention.&nbsp; I think both of you should keep your breasts bare at all times.�&nbsp; He pulled Ivy toward him, then caught me in his embrace.&nbsp; With his arm around my back, his hand squeezed my left breast.&nbsp; I glanced at Ivy.&nbsp; His other arm around her back, his fingers pressed into her opposite breast.

�Jenny&#8217;s too timid for that,� said Ivy.&nbsp;&nbsp; �The only time she takes her shirt off is when she&#8217;s desperate for a whipping.�

�I just had a whipping.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t want another one.�

�You must want another one.&nbsp; Why else would you come out here half naked.�

I looked at Rafiq.&nbsp; He smiled at me sympathetically, but said nothing.

Ivy continued, �I don&#8217;t think the Skipper whipped you hard enough.&nbsp; Where are your whip marks anyway?�

�He used this real stingy martinet.&nbsp; It hurt a lot but it didn&#8217;t leave many marks.&nbsp; So maybe...�&nbsp; I almost suggested that maybe Ivy was the one who should be whipped.&nbsp; But I wasn&#8217;t about cede Rafiq&#8217;s focus to Ivy.&nbsp; Instead, I said, �Maybe tomorrow.&nbsp; The Skipper thinks I should start having a daily whipping.�

�Is that what he said?� asked Rafiq.&nbsp; �What did you say to that?�

�Well, when he suggested it, I didn&#8217;t think much of the idea.&nbsp; But I don&#8217;t know.&nbsp; Maybe it depends on who&#8217;s holding the whip.�

Ivy said, �How about if I put the cane to your tits?�

Somehow I managed to resist jabbing back at her.&nbsp; Instead I said, �I&#8217;m sorry you&#8217;re so angry at me.&nbsp; I can&#8217;t help it that I&#8217;m so fond of Rafiq.�

�I&#8217;m being a real bitch, aren&#8217;t I?� asked Ivy as she looked at Rafiq.

�Well, I guess that&#8217;s one way to put it,� he answered.

�It&#8217;s only because she&#8217;s put herself between us.&nbsp; That&#8217;s why I get upset with her.�

�Well, why would I see either of you being between me and the other?� he said, standing with one arm around each of us.

Ivy replied, �Yes, Rafiq, but... the other thing is that she&#8217;s so manipulative.&nbsp; Jenny, you&#8217;re manipulative, setting me up to be the ogre and you&#8217;re the innocent victim and so holy about it.�

I knew she was close to the target.&nbsp; I said, �I don&#8217;t want to be at war with you.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t want Rafiq to have to be in the middle of it.&nbsp; So I&#8217;m trying not to give in to my natural feelings that you are in the way.�

�Oh, you&#8217;re so virtuous,� she said sarcastically.

�I&#8217;m not virtuous.&nbsp; I&#8217;m seeking my own happiness.�

Ivy sighed but said no more.&nbsp; All of us remained silent for some time.&nbsp; With an arm around my back, Rafiq was massaging my breast.

After a time, Ivy said, �I&#8217;m sorry I&#8217;ve been behaving so badly.&nbsp; You mean a lot to me.�&nbsp; Even though she was addressing Rafiq, she turned toward me and put her arm around me.&nbsp; I reciprocated and the three of us hugged.

***********

The next afternoon, while April and James were attending the boat, I was on deck chatting with Rafiq and Ivy.&nbsp; It was a hot day.&nbsp; I was wearing only my bikini.&nbsp; Ivy was topless, which made me a bit uncomfortable, since I felt some pressure to match her.&nbsp; But I kept my top on, in part because I was sitting where James could see me, and I was still galled by his insult about me needing a boob job.

Early in the conversation, Ivy again apologized for her behavior the previous night.&nbsp; She was going out of her way to be pleasant to me.&nbsp; I reciprocated.&nbsp; I can enjoy Ivy&#8217;s company; it&#8217;s only our situation, vying for Rafiq, that&#8217;s problematic.

Rafiq wanted a blow-by-blow account of my previous night&#8217;s session with the Skipper.&nbsp; I obliged with a detailed narrative.&nbsp; In a group I don&#8217;t naturally take to being the center of conversation, but it seemed that this was something that people really wanted to hear.

And I didn&#8217;t mind the sympathy they offered, however limited it was.&nbsp; Although he tried to respond appropriately, Rafiq couldn&#8217;t help getting carried away by the erotic essence of the experience, even though I downplayed the sexuality and only obliquely touched on the orgasmic culmination.

Ivy responded more sympathetically than did Rafiq.&nbsp; But underneath I&#8217;m sure she got some enjoyment out of hearing of my travails.&nbsp; Still, my sensible side felt it was only related to the circumstance of our competition, independent of how she would otherwise regard me as a person.

Intrigued and amused by my telling of the Skipper&#8217;s daily regimen suggestion, Rafiq asked, �This thing about a daily whipping, what is that kind of regimen supposed to do for you?�

I was willing to string him along with it.&nbsp; �Well, I don&#8217;t know.&nbsp; He said he thought it would keep me feeling at my peak, whatever that means.�&nbsp; I couldn&#8217;t help giggling when I said that.

�Like some kind of extra-vigorous massage therapy.&nbsp; Well, why not?&nbsp; I can see you getting into it.�

Ivy said, �Jenny takes to it naturally.&nbsp; Do you think I should consider it too?&nbsp; You could try it out with me.�

Eeyew.&nbsp; This was starting to sound really fucked up.&nbsp; Two women vying for a guy&#8217;s attention by seeing who can accept the most punishment.&nbsp; Sick.&nbsp; I said, �Oh, this daily regimen is only the kind of crazy thing the Skipper says to tease me.&nbsp; He wasn&#8217;t serious about it.�

The Skipper was coming up the steps from the cabin as I said that.&nbsp; He approached us.

Rafiq addressed him, �Hey Doc, I hear you&#8217;re considering a special health regimen for the girls.�

�What?&nbsp; ...Oh yes.&nbsp; It&#8217;s my recommendation for keeping Jenny at her peak.&nbsp; I hope I didn&#8217;t just hear her say I wasn&#8217;t serious.�

Everybody looked at me, even April and James.&nbsp; I said, �Well, I guess it was me that didn&#8217;t seriously consider it.�

The Skipper answered, �No big decision.&nbsp; Take it one day at a time.&nbsp; But you&#8217;re looking pert today.&nbsp; I can tell you&#8217;re up for it.�

Everybody awaited my answer.&nbsp; I glanced at Rafiq.&nbsp; He had a twinkle in his eye.&nbsp; I wasn&#8217;t sure what to say.&nbsp; But it was Ivy who spoke up, �I can give it a try.�

Well...&nbsp; That took the pressure off me.&nbsp; All attention was now on Ivy.&nbsp; But there was no question that I had to match her.&nbsp; But should I do it simultaneously or sequentially?&nbsp; Subsequent to Ivy would seem best, unless her bout got so hot that nobody had any energy left for me.&nbsp; But indecision meant I would wait.&nbsp; So be it.

Skipper seemed surprised by Ivy&#8217;s offer but said, �Sure, it would do you a world of good.&nbsp; Let me go get my implements.�&nbsp; The Skipper disappeared below.

Returning with belt-strap, cane, switch, single-thong whip, and martinet, he said, �Before you people brought up the subject of the daily whipping regimen, what had actually occurred to me for an afternoon activity was a wrestling match between the girls.&nbsp; Wouldn&#8217;t that be cute?�

�Yes!&nbsp; Do it,� called out James from the helm.

The Skipper continued, �But since Ivy&#8217;s up for a vigorous whipping now, I&#8217;m thinking we could test the efficacy of the health regimen.&nbsp; My guess is that after a good whipping, Ivy will win against Jenny, then win against April.�

�Whoa, wait a minute,� said Rafiq.&nbsp; �The basic idea is great, but I don&#8217;t think I can go for a match between Ivy and Jenny.&nbsp; That&#8217;s just asking for more trouble.�

�Oh.&nbsp; I hadn&#8217;t thought about that.&nbsp;&nbsp; ...Maybe the way to do it is to have Jenny and April wrestle.&nbsp; If April wins, she wrestles Ivy.&nbsp; And we bet that a good whipping beforehand will invigorate Ivy so that she wins that match.�

�And for this to work out, I&#8217;m supposed to make sure I lose to April.&nbsp; Is that right?� I asked.&nbsp; I didn&#8217;t actually care what my role was; I just wanted to know what he wanted.

�No, that&#8217;s not right.&nbsp; I&#8217;ll really give you a whipping if you don&#8217;t try as hard as you can.&nbsp; Understand?�

�Okay.&nbsp; Whatever.&nbsp; Sorry I said anything.�

�So, are you girls up for it?�

The three of us looked at each other.&nbsp; After some hesitation, Ivy nodded.&nbsp; April shrugged.&nbsp; I was not going object.&nbsp; So without any great enthusiasm, the three of us assented.
�Now, for the rules,� said the Skipper.

�I suggest they get points for stripping their opponent,� said Rafiq.

�And face sitting,� said James.

Concerned, I looked at April.&nbsp; But she looked amused.&nbsp; April is big enough that I didn&#8217;t much like the idea of her sitting on my face, but I kept quiet.

�And for getting a finger in an orifice?� asked Rafiq, seemingly to me.

�This is starting to sound really unpleasant,� I said.

Ivy said, �Maybe it&#8217;s okay if we&#8217;re all gentle.&nbsp; We all agree not to do anything stupid or mean to try to win?&nbsp; I personally don&#8217;t give a shit who wins.�

�You better give a shit,� said the Skipper.&nbsp; �Because the loser&#8217;s in for a hell of whipping, especially if I think you&#8217;re not trying.�

�Now wait a minute,� I said.&nbsp; �I&#8217;m not agreeing to any kind of hellacious whipping.&nbsp; None of us are going to agree to that, I hope.�

�Oh, take it easy.&nbsp; Don&#8217;t take my words so literally.&nbsp; A good whipping, yes, but nothing you can&#8217;t handle.&nbsp; You know I don&#8217;t whip you that bad, even though you&#8217;re the one that needs it the most.�

�I need it the most?&nbsp; Why me?&nbsp; Ivy&#8217;s the one who volunteered for your whipping regimen.�

�Come on.&nbsp; You know you need it too,� said the Skipper.

Putting his arm around me, Rafiq said, �Everything will be cool.&nbsp; Just be gentle with your opponent and everybody will come out happy.�

I&#8217;m sure I didn&#8217;t look too pleased about it, but I acquiesced to the idea I&#8217;d probably get a face full of April&#8217;s crotch, get finger fucked, and in the end still get whipped for my troubles.

�Okay, let&#8217;s spread the mattress pads so the deck isn&#8217;t so hard,� said the Skipper.&nbsp; 

Rafiq, Ivy, April, and I went below and brought up four of the foam mattress pads, and placed them together on the deck.

�Okay,� said the Skipper.&nbsp; �April and Jenny face off, on your knees so nobody gets hurt.&nbsp; Us guys will be the judges and will offer encouragement to the combatants.�

So April and I faced off, with the guys crowding around.&nbsp; I asked her, �Do you know what you&#8217;re doing?�

�Of course not.&nbsp; All I know is from watching some stupid professional wrestling for a few minutes on TV once or twice.�

�That&#8217;s good.&nbsp; Because I certainly don&#8217;t know what I&#8217;m doing.�

�Just be sure you don&#8217;t tear my swimsuit.�

�Right,� I agreed.&nbsp; �I bought this one special for this trip, for more than I should have spent, and I&#8217;ll be really upset if it gets wrecked.�

Rafiq said, �We&#8217;ll assist in getting the swimsuits off without tearing them.&nbsp; You don&#8217;t have to worry.�

�What?&nbsp; You guys are going to strip us while we&#8217;re wrestling?�

�No,� replied Rafiq.&nbsp; �But once your opponent has exposed you, then we&#8217;ll help get it off so nothing gets torn.&nbsp; So go to it.&nbsp; The match has begun.�

To Rafiq and James, the Skipper said, �Here, take your pick of encouragement devices.�

Appalled, I watched Rafiq take the switch and James take the martinet.&nbsp; The Skipper set aside the cane and whip but held on to the strap.

�They&#8217;re going to swat us,� I said.

�So we better get this over quickly,� April replied, grabbing me.&nbsp; I fell into her, gave a tug at her bikini top, and popped one of her big boobs into view.

�Jenny scores one,� said Rafiq.

April tried to pull up my top but I held it down.&nbsp; Maybe my smaller build gave me an advantage of a snug fit.

Giving her a bear hug to prevent her from exposing my front, I undid the tie to her bikini top in the back.&nbsp; She retaliated by spanking my butt, both of us laughing and squealing.

�Come on, April,� said James, as he pulled her bikini top away.&nbsp; �You can easily take her.&nbsp; Pull her bottom down.�

April responded by exposing my rear end.&nbsp; But I kept hugging her tightly, my crotch pressed against her thigh.

To me, having my rear end exposed was not equivalent to having lost my swimsuit bottom, but apparently it was good enough for Rafiq, who began pulling it all the way down.&nbsp; When I complained and tried to resist, the Skipper gave me a couple hard swats on the butt with his strap.

Being on my knees, my swimsuit bottom wasn&#8217;t coming all the way off without my cooperation.&nbsp;&nbsp; Whap!&nbsp; Whap!&nbsp; Whap!&nbsp; Three more stinging strap strokes across the rear assured that I did not withhold that cooperation.

April topless, and me now bottomless, we continued with ineffectual pushing and tugging at each other.

�This is lame,� said James.&nbsp; �We need to get these girls going.�&nbsp; He set aside the martinet and took up the long whip, which he proceeded to lash across April&#8217;s back.&nbsp; The wraparound stung me on the side.&nbsp; April yelped.&nbsp; I gasped.

Another stroke, then another.&nbsp; Both wrapped around and must have stung me every bit as hard as they stung April.&nbsp; But the effect on April was rather opposite of what he intended.&nbsp; Rather than spurring her to action against me, she seemed paralyzed, crying out with each stroke, and cringing between strokes.

Remaining locked in a tight embrace, yelping and gasping, April and I writhed and wriggled against each other as we recoiled from each stroke, which James laid across the back, butt, or thighs.&nbsp; April pulled my top up enough to bare my breasts as I pressed against her.&nbsp; I liked that feeling.

It was a curious juxtaposition of sensations.&nbsp; The warmth of April&#8217;s tight embrace.&nbsp; The sound of the whip.&nbsp; The motion of her body flinching with each stroke.&nbsp; The sting on my own body.&nbsp; It was such a stimulating experience to share.&nbsp; My crotch pressed to her thigh.

After about thirty strokes, James left off.&nbsp; Still I clasped her tightly, pressing my body against her, even as she loosened her embrace with me.

I heard Rafiq murmur, �You can see what Jenny wants.�

I glanced warily at him and the Skipper.&nbsp; But both were beaming at me.&nbsp; I felt reassured.&nbsp; People knew what I liked and it was all right.

But James was impatient.&nbsp; �What do we have to do to get these girls to fight?&nbsp; April doesn&#8217;t do anything.�

Skipper replied, �April, if you don&#8217;t force Jenny down right now, we&#8217;re going to separate you two, and James will put the whip to your breasts.�

April immediately responded by pushing me hard sideways, saying, �You&#8217;re the one who likes to get it on the tits, not me.�

�I do not,� I replied, extending my leg sideways to give me leverage to resist.

Whap!&nbsp; �Ow!&nbsp; Shit, that hurt!� I cried.&nbsp; The Skipper had hit me really hard on the pussy with the strap.&nbsp; I closed my legs and crumpled, letting April throw me to the mat.

With me on my back, she fell across my body and immediately shifted toward a 69 position.&nbsp; Knees up and together, I kept her from getting at my crotch.&nbsp; But she parked her crotch right over my face.

James pulled the crotch of her swimsuit aside, and her bare pussy ended up opposite my mouth.&nbsp; Because my arms were pinned, the most I could do was attack her with my tongue.&nbsp; Giggling all the while, she pressed her pussy onto my mouth.

Then Rafiq and the Skipper pulled my knees apart, allowing April to get at my crotch.&nbsp; After lubricating her finger in her mouth, she starting slipping it into my tunnel.&nbsp; There was little I could do to resist.

�Ooh.&nbsp; You bitch,� I complained.&nbsp; At least April keeps her nails short.&nbsp; Better than having Ivy scraping her long nails up there.

With an effort I managed to free my hand from under her leg and squeeze her breast.&nbsp; Then I gave her nipple a hard pinch.&nbsp; She retaliated by roughly frigging my pussy.&nbsp; With her finger inside me, she had the upper hand.&nbsp; I eased up on her nipple, begging �Ow, ow, ow.&nbsp; Don&#8217;t hurt me.�

Although she stopped being rough, she kept that finger up in there, gently frigging me.&nbsp; I felt humiliated that the guys had ganged up to hold my legs open so that she could violate me like this.&nbsp; I lay there helpless just wishing this would end.

�Come on, Jenny.&nbsp; Do something,� said Rafiq.&nbsp; And then he hit me with the switch on the inside of the thigh.&nbsp; The Skipper followed suit by hitting me on the inside of the other thigh with the strap.

�Ow...&nbsp;&nbsp; Ooh...&nbsp; Oh, please,� I cried as they laid on one stroke after another.

I had to do something.&nbsp; Struggling to get my arm up, I was able to get near April&#8217;s crotch.&nbsp; Her pussy was not quite in range, so I went for the orifice that I could reach.&nbsp; I pressed my finger to her asshole.&nbsp; With a squeal, April rolled off me, extracting her finger from me.&nbsp; I immediately rolled over on my stomach and adjusted my swimsuit top to cover my breasts.&nbsp;&nbsp; I&#8217;d been face-sat and finger fucked.&nbsp; Was there any need to continue?

There was a gentle touch on my cheek.&nbsp; �Heyyy...&nbsp; Good job,� murmured Rafiq.&nbsp; He stroked my back.

I smiled up at him.&nbsp; Right now there was nothing I could want more than some gentle attention from Rafiq.&nbsp; He eased me to a sitting position.&nbsp; �Is the match over?� I asked.&nbsp; I felt I had adequately acquitted myself, while appropriately taking the role of loser.

�No,� said the Skipper.&nbsp; �This is still indecisive.&nbsp; Jenny hasn&#8217;t even been stripped.�

�I pulled her top up,� said April.&nbsp; �You guys are supposed to take it off her.�

Calmly looking Rafiq in the eye, I raised my hands over my head, surrendering my body to him, expecting to charm him irresistibly.

Rafiq placed his hands on my sides, and slowly caressed upwards to meet my bikini top.&nbsp; Well satisfied, I closed my eyes.&nbsp; He gently lifted my top up, exposing my breasts to him, and raised it slowly over my head.&nbsp; I resisted stealing a glance toward Ivy.&nbsp; I knew she would not be pleased.

It was not yet off my arms when the Skipper said, �Hey, this looks good.&nbsp; We gotta teach these girls some wrestling holds.&nbsp; Let&#8217;s have them practice a full nelson.&nbsp; April, get behind Jenny and we&#8217;ll show you how to do it.�

With April and me on our knees, he had her immobilize me from behind, with my arms locked overhead, her hold levered behind my neck.&nbsp; �Okay, Jenny.&nbsp; Now try to get out,� he said.

I wriggled a little, but it was obvious that I wasn&#8217;t going anywhere.&nbsp; I looked at Rafiq.&nbsp; His eyes were glued to my breasts.

�You&#8217;re not trying hard enough, Jenny,� said the Skipper.&nbsp; He lashed the martinet hard across my breasts.&nbsp; I gasped.&nbsp; He lashed me again.&nbsp; Then again and again.&nbsp; I writhed and squirmed, but I couldn&#8217;t get out of the hold and I couldn&#8217;t avoid the whip strokes.

�Hold her good, April,� said James, and he lashed the long whip across her back, wrapping it around so that it caught my front.&nbsp; He kept at so that I was getting whipped in double time, the Skipper&#8217;s martinet stroke directly on the breasts, followed by James wraparound whip stroke to the ribs or stomach.

�April, let me go.&nbsp; Oh-my-god, they&#8217;re whipping me so hard.�

�Hold her tight April,� said James.&nbsp; �Unless you want what she&#8217;s getting.�

�I don&#8217;t dare let you go, Jenny,� said April.&nbsp; �I&#8217;m already getting it almost as bad as you.�

I said nothing more, but I knew I was getting it a lot worse than her.&nbsp; Besides having the Skipper scoring my breasts with the martinet, the wraparound end of James&#8217; long whip goes faster and hits harder than what she was getting.&nbsp; And I was getting it all on the front.&nbsp; ...But still, from the way she cried out with each stroke, it seemed that she was taking as much she could bear, as was I, although I was not quite so loud about it.

As the two guys continued whipping me, Rafiq disappeared below.&nbsp; Had he abandoned me?&nbsp; The Skipper paused to feel my breasts, saying, �Those titties really need the whip.�

James too paused.&nbsp; Then he took hold of my stiff nipples and pinching hard, shook my breasts.&nbsp; I was shocked; he had no right to touch me.&nbsp; He had already abused me with his words, and now with his hands.

He said to the Skipper, �Do you think whipping tits makes them grow bigger?�

�No, you dumb asshole,� replied the Skipper.&nbsp; �It makes them prettier.&nbsp; ...And get your hands off her.�

James did not immediately respond, but with the sound of Rafiq bounding back up the steps, he released my nipples and stepped away.

�Here, this should inspire Jenny,� said Rafiq, holding the butterfly vibrator.

�Great idea,� said the Skipper.&nbsp; �See if we can energize her.�

So Rafiq held the buzzing vibrator to my clit, and at the same time began teasing my breasts with the switch, bumping it over my stiff nipples.&nbsp; I squirmed.&nbsp; I didn&#8217;t want to be made to climax exposed like this.

The erotic sensations were mixed with the flashback of the last switching I got on the breasts &#8211; when Ivy put it to my nipples so harshly that I had fainted.&nbsp; Rafiq wouldn&#8217;t do that to me, would he?

Sswit!&nbsp; On the chest just above the nipples.&nbsp; I gasped.&nbsp;&nbsp; ...Sswit!&nbsp; A hard stroke on the lower part of my breasts.&nbsp; �Ow.&nbsp; That hurts.�&nbsp; ...Sswit!&nbsp; Just below the nipples.&nbsp; ...Sswit!&nbsp; Right across the nipples.&nbsp; �Oooooh!&nbsp; Not there!�&nbsp;&nbsp; ...Sswit!&nbsp; Again!

I jerked back and forth, trying to get free.&nbsp; Sswit!&nbsp; �Ow, ow, ow.&nbsp; My tits.&nbsp; My tits.�&nbsp; ...Sswit!&nbsp; Yet again on the nipples.&nbsp;&nbsp; ...Then again.&nbsp; �Oooooh!&nbsp; Not on the tits.�&nbsp; And then several more times again.&nbsp; My nipples were on fire.&nbsp; ...Sswit! Sswit!&nbsp; Sswit!&nbsp; �Ahhhhhh!&nbsp; Please no more.&nbsp; I give up.&nbsp; April.&nbsp; I can&#8217;t take any more!�

April relaxed her hold just enough for me to slip downward out of it.&nbsp; I collapsed to the mat, lying on my side, gasping and holding my breasts.

�The winner,� announced James raising April hand over her head.&nbsp; With her other hand she had to fend off his pawing at her bared breasts.

Meanwhile, murmuring �Beautiful, beautiful,� Rafiq knelt over me, comforting me.&nbsp; On the one hand, I was grateful for his solicitude.&nbsp; On the other hand, I was freaked out that he had whipped my breasts so hard.

After a time, when I had recovered my breath, he said, �You were so awesome.&nbsp; A little more practice and you could be a professional wrestler.&nbsp; Of course for a woman it&#8217;s much sexier to lose than to win.�

�Oh gee, thanks,� I said sarcastically.&nbsp; �And I suppose you would be my manager.&nbsp; And after losing, you would punish me right out in front of everyone.�

�Great idea.&nbsp; Before the fight, I could lead you to the ring in bondage, then release you.&nbsp; After you lose the match, I&#8217;d give you a good whipping out there.&nbsp; Then I&#8217;d lead you away, wrists bound behind your back and your well-whipped breasts bared.&nbsp; You&#8217;d be such a crowd pleaser.�

�You are a crazy pervert.&nbsp; ...That really hurt, what you did to my breasts with the switch.�

�Oh...� murmured Rafiq.&nbsp; �But you took it like a heroine.�&nbsp; He had me roll onto my back, and on all fours over me, he gazed into my eyes appreciatively.&nbsp; I ran my fingers over his furry chest.&nbsp; Then he kissed my breasts.&nbsp; I brought my hands above my head, and arching my back, surrendered myself to him.

He began sucking my nipple.&nbsp; Mmm.&nbsp; I love that.&nbsp; I wrapped my legs around him, pressing my bare crotch against his body.&nbsp; Yet I felt uneasy doing such a thing in public.&nbsp; We might be making a spectacle.

�When you two get done fornicating, we have another match to do,� said the Skipper.

�We&#8217;re not fornicating,� I said, unwrapping my legs from around Rafiq, and pushing his face away from my breast.&nbsp; Rafiq, remained on all fours over me for several moments, but finally sat up and allowed me to rise.&nbsp; As we got up, he adjusted the big bulge under his shorts.

�Where&#8217;s my swimsuit?� I asked.

Picking up the top and bottom, the Skipper said, �What do you need your swimsuit for?&nbsp; You&#8217;re fine as you are.�

�I&#8217;m not comfortable like this.�&nbsp; For emphasis, I covered my breasts and crotch with my hands.&nbsp; I had been exposed enough for one day.

Passing his hands along the inside surfaces of my bikini top and bottom, the Skipper said, �Your tits and pussy have been in here.&nbsp; That makes them special.&nbsp; I&#8217;m going hold on to them for a while.�&nbsp; He put the crotch of my swimsuit bottom to his face.

�You&#8217;re an even bigger pervert than Rafiq,� I said, knowing the Skipper would take that as a high compliment.&nbsp; �But if you really can&#8217;t give it up, I&#8217;ll go put something else on.�

�No, no,� he replied.&nbsp; �Wear your swimsuit.&nbsp; It&#8217;s much nicer than anything else you have.�&nbsp; More revealing is obviously what he meant by &#8216;nicer&#8217;.

He handed me the bottom, and I put it on.&nbsp; When I looked to him for the top he said to me quietly, �Don&#8217;t bother with your top.&nbsp; Ivy&#8217;s not wearing hers, so obviously you&#8217;re better off without it.&nbsp; You look very natural without it.�

I looked at Rafiq.&nbsp; He smiled and nodded affirmation.&nbsp; I glanced toward James, but he was paying no attention to me.&nbsp; ...All right.&nbsp; I would go topless for now.

�Okay, it&#8217;s time to prepare Ivy for her match with April,� said the Skipper.&nbsp; �Are you ready to be fortified?&nbsp; Come on over here and we&#8217;ll turn you into the woman of steel.�

With some hesitation, Ivy approached.&nbsp; The Skipper had taken up the cane.&nbsp; Ivy eyed it with obvious apprehension.&nbsp; �How many strokes do you intend to give me?�

�Oh, I don&#8217;t know.&nbsp; Enough to energize you.&nbsp; Now bend over and take your medicine.&nbsp; Legs wide apart.�

I&#8217;ll admit being tickled that Ivy was going to have to take it bending over.&nbsp; More humiliating.&nbsp; And maybe I feel that I&#8217;m the only one who should take it facing my disciplinarian.

Anyway, after some hesitation, she bent over.&nbsp; Her bikini bottom being skimpy &#8211; a lot skimpier than mine &#8211; her suntanned buns were fully exposed to the cane.&nbsp; The Skipper touched the cane to her, tapping it up and down her butt.

Then he slowly drew it back.&nbsp; Whoosh-thack!&nbsp; With a loud gasp, Ivy instantly straightened up, rubbing her buns.&nbsp; She glanced around at us, then bent over again without saying anything.

Whoosh-thack!&nbsp; This time she voiced her pain but stayed bent over.&nbsp; ...Whoosh-thack!&nbsp; ...And then again.&nbsp; Whoosh-thack!&nbsp; ...Then one to the back of the thighs.&nbsp; Whoosh-thack!&nbsp; �Ow!&nbsp; Fuck!�&nbsp; Straightening up and turning to Rafiq, she said, �He&#8217;s hitting me too hard.�

The Skipper replied, �For a lusty girl like you?&nbsp; I&#8217;m surprised.&nbsp; But Rafiq can administer it if you&#8217;d rather.&nbsp; Or we can have Jenny accept a few of the strokes you were supposed to get.&nbsp; She still needs some punishment for losing.�

Ivy glanced at me with annoyance and said, �I want Rafiq to do it.&nbsp; Jenny can&#8217;t take any more now.�

Despite the words, I was pretty sure she was more concerned about keeping me away from center stage than of sparing me another whipping.&nbsp; Whatever.&nbsp; I had no wish to share a caning.&nbsp; But it sounded as if the Skipper thought I had more coming.&nbsp; That was not a welcome prospect, considering how much I had already taken.

So Rafiq took up the cane from the Skipper.&nbsp; Ivy bent over again, legs wide apart, holding her ankles. Rafiq tapped the cane to her butt, then slid it down her legs, then back up and across her back.&nbsp; Then he started teasing her front with it.

Ivy came up a bit, holding her calves instead of her ankles.&nbsp; Rafiq started tapping the cane on her breasts.&nbsp; Watching them jiggle, I couldn&#8217;t help glancing down at my own, but I tried to avoid comparing myself.

After harassing her breasts with the cane, Rafiq returned the cane to her butt, tracing back and forth on it.&nbsp; Preliminaries completed, Rafiq finally swatted her.&nbsp; Ivy voiced an �Ahhhh� that sounded like satisfaction.

Rafiq proceeded to give her a caning.&nbsp; Stroke after hard stroke, he scored her bottom, marking it with horizontal stripes.&nbsp; Early on she straightened a couple times and danced around in pain.&nbsp; But after that she pretty much stayed bent over, but still she let us know what she was feeling.

Witnessing Rafiq give Ivy a caning was a good bit different than being on the receiving end of the sting.&nbsp; Although I liked watching the vigor with which Rafiq approached the task, it is the sound that has more power.&nbsp; The whoosh as the cane slices air.&nbsp; Thack as it strikes flesh.&nbsp; Ivy&#8217;s gasping yelp.&nbsp; Power.&nbsp; Energy.&nbsp; Emotion.

As much as I would like to find Ivy wanting, I couldn&#8217;t help admiring her courage and stamina.&nbsp; Yet while one part of me reveled in Ivy&#8217;s caning, another part of me abhorred it.&nbsp; I felt responsible for fostering this environment where the females were continually being punished by the males.&nbsp; It would not be Ivy&#8217;s natural inclination to submit to this kind of treatment if she weren&#8217;t in competition with me.

Thus I couldn&#8217;t help feeling that my constant acquiescence to corporal punishment was creating parallel difficulties for Ivy and April.&nbsp; Furthermore, it was fostering unwholesome attitudes and appetites in Rafiq, the Skipper, and James.

If only I would just stand up for myself and refuse to accept this kind of treatment.&nbsp; That shouldn&#8217;t be so hard to do.&nbsp; Yet some part of me seems to crave the energy the guys pour into it.&nbsp; And&nbsp; somehow people seem to recognize that.

Such were my thoughts as Rafiq whipped Ivy&#8217;s rear end with the cane, one hard stroke after another.&nbsp; Finally with Ivy near tears, her butt well marked with stripes, Rafiq finally left off.&nbsp; �There you go.&nbsp; All ready for your match with April.�

Ivy straightened up slowly, rubbing her rear end.&nbsp; �Oh fuck, that hurts.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t feel ready for anything.�

Giving her a hug, Rafiq said, �Of course you need a little time to get yourself together.&nbsp; ...God, you&#8217;re tough.&nbsp; The way you took your caning was awesome.�&nbsp; He kissed her tenderly.

�Like a true heroine,� added the Skipper.

Ooh!&nbsp; I was wincing.&nbsp; Ivy soaking up Rafiq&#8217;s affection, and everyone&#8217;s praise.&nbsp; And I thought the term heroine was reserved for me.

The Skipper glanced in my direction.&nbsp; Whatever my expression was telling him, he held his gaze on me.&nbsp; Then he said, �Before we start the next match, it&#8217;s time to outfit Jenny.&nbsp; She&#8217;s not used to being a mere spectator.&nbsp; We don&#8217;t want her to be bored.�&nbsp; Then stepping behind me, he said, �Cross your arms behind your back and clasp your elbows.�

I did as he instructed.&nbsp; He then bound my arms behind my back with a rope.&nbsp; All eyes were on me again, even Rafiq&#8217;s, as he continued to caress Ivy.

Standing behind me, murmuring �Good girl,� the Skipper stroked my shoulders and upper arms.&nbsp; Then he passed his hands over my breasts, first gently caressing, then more vigorously squeezing their softness, then pinching and prodding my stiff nipples.

Over my shoulder, his face next to mine, I looked back at him, biting my lip and wincing, trying to endure the increasing vigor with which he worked my nipples.&nbsp; My forearms not so tightly bound that I could not have freed my arms to protect myself, but I forced myself to continue clasping my elbows behind my back.&nbsp; But finally when I thought I could take no more, he eased up.&nbsp; I exhaled.

�Now you can wear the nipple clips.&nbsp; Last night you were telling me it was your favorite ornamentation.�

�I did not.&nbsp; I said they hurt.�

�And that&#8217;s what you like,� he said, setting a clip to my left nipple and slowly letting it pinch on.&nbsp; I held my breath, grimacing, as it bit in with electrifying intensity.&nbsp; Then he pinched the other onto my right nipple.

�Now that Jenny&#8217;s happy, let&#8217;s get this match started.&nbsp; Ivy and April, onto the mats.�

As Ivy and April knelt facing each other, both topless, I forced myself to breathe.&nbsp; Could I accept, even embrace the sensation of those diminutive metal jaws biting into my nipples?&nbsp; Not wishing them off, just letting them be.&nbsp; Not labeling it as pain.

Meanwhile Ivy and April started grappling with each other.&nbsp; Ivy&#8217;s efforts seemed restrained and ineffectual.&nbsp; Soon she was lying prone with April on her back.&nbsp; With encouragement and guidance from James, April managed to get Ivy into a full nelson and roll her front side up, April underneath her.

Here was a golden opportunity to whip her on the front, and Rafiq and the Skipper didn&#8217;t pass it up.&nbsp; Stroke after stroke they whipped her belly, ribs, and breasts, Rafiq with the martinet, the Skipper with the switch.&nbsp; And James was lashing the single-thong whip across both of their legs.

Rafiq said, �The experiment isn&#8217;t working according to theory.�

The Skipper replied, �The theory is right.&nbsp; The girls are screwing up the experiment.&nbsp; We gotta whip them more.�

Laughing, Rafiq said, �All purpose remedy.�

As they continued swatting her, Ivy yelped with each stroke.&nbsp; Finally it was becoming clear that she had enough.&nbsp; ...Whap!&nbsp; �Ow!&nbsp; Shit.&nbsp; You win.�&nbsp; ...Sswit!&nbsp; �Oooh!&nbsp; Fuck!&nbsp; Stop.�&nbsp; ...Whap!&nbsp; �Ow!&nbsp; Assholes, I give up.�

The Skipper blared, �Come on, Ivy, break out of that hold.�

James was calling out, �Hold her, April.&nbsp; Hold her good.�

So Ivy&#8217;s whipping continued, stroke after hard stroke, Ivy screeching all the while.&nbsp; Why wouldn&#8217;t April release her?&nbsp; Oh-my-god, now James took up the cane and whacked it really hard right onto Ivy&#8217;s pussy.&nbsp; Even not bare, that must have really hurt.&nbsp; ...Then he did it again.&nbsp; This had to stop!

Freeing my loosely bound arms from the rope, I thrust forward to intervene.&nbsp; Plunging into the midst, I shielded Ivy from their whipping, taking the force of their stokes on my arms and on my back.

�What the hell do you think you&#8217;re doing?� snarled the Skipper.&nbsp; Grabbing my wrist, he twisted me around and flayed me on the side of the breast with the switch.

I let out a screech.&nbsp; To protect my front I tried to fall onto Ivy and April, now finally separating from each other.&nbsp; In the struggle, I somehow let the Skipper grasp both my wrists with his left hand, and he managed turn me and raise my arms just enough that he could thrash my breasts.

He rained the switch down on me.&nbsp; It must have been close to twenty strokes in rapid succession.&nbsp; With the first few strokes he whacked the clips off of my nipples.&nbsp; �EEEEEEE!�&nbsp; I let out a scream, and then continued screaming as he scored my nipples stroke after furious stroke.&nbsp; �EEEEEEE!�&nbsp; It was an inferno of pain.&nbsp; I thought I was going to faint.

�Lay off!&nbsp; You&#8217;re really hurting her, you bastard,� yelled Rafiq, seizing the Skipper&#8217;s hand.

As the Skipper released me, I dropped to the mat, sitting on my heels, clutching my breasts, panting, trying not to lose consciousness as the tsunami of pain crested.&nbsp; Engulfed in a dizzy hyper dysreality, my mind was just trying to gage what was happening to me.&nbsp; Yet it seemed that I had not been physically damaged ...I held hope that this trial would pass.

Meanwhile another bizarre scene was registering before my eyes.&nbsp; Getting to her feet, Ivy was irate at the way the guys had treated her.&nbsp; �Fucking assholes!&nbsp; You&#8217;re too god-damn rough.�&nbsp; Turning to Rafiq, she gave him a hard slap on the face.&nbsp; Rafiq looked startled and took a step back from her.

Turning her ire to James, she yelled, �Bastard!&nbsp; Gimme that cane.&nbsp; I&#8217;m going to show you how it feels.�&nbsp; James backed away from her, not yielding the cane.&nbsp; She kicked at him, though not hard with her bare feet.&nbsp; �Then here,� she said, and raked her nails over his forearm, leaving a series of red lines.

�Ow,� he said, rubbing his arm.&nbsp; �Awright, I get the message.&nbsp; Sorry.&nbsp; I didn&#8217;t know...�

Satisfied with James, Ivy looked at the Skipper.&nbsp; Looking as surprised and alarmed as anyone, he was positioned behind Rafiq.&nbsp; Ivy glared at him for a moment, then turned away and descended the steps into the cabin.

Nobody said anything.&nbsp; The guys didn&#8217;t even move.&nbsp; The stinging pain of my breasts having slackened enough that I no longer felt immobilized, I looked at April.&nbsp; Quietly she said to me, �I&#8217;m going in.&nbsp; Are you coming?�

Rising unsteadily, I followed her down into the girls&#8217; compartment.











Chapter 8:&nbsp; The Wages of Seduction

Ensconced in our compartment, door locked, Ivy proceeded vent her ire on April. &#8220;Why didn&#8217;t you let me go?&nbsp; I said I gave up.&nbsp; You knew they were hurting me.&#8221;

Defensive, April replied, &#8220;No I didn&#8217;t.&nbsp; ...I thought you were just making a lot of noise.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t know...&#8221;

&#8220;Bitch.&nbsp; What are you, a moron?&nbsp; Can&#8217;t understand English?&#8221;

&#8220;Why are you blaming me?&#8221; demanded April, now getting more agitated.

&#8220;Because you&#8217;re a fucked-up bitch who gets pleasure out of my pain.&nbsp; Rafiq and the Skipper were beating my tits.&nbsp; And that asshole James hit me so hard on the pussy I thought I was going to die.&nbsp; And you held me there so they could do it.&#8221;

&#8220;This stupid wrestling match wasn&#8217;t my idea.&nbsp; You were the one who wanted to do it.&#8221;

&#8220;I was not.&nbsp; We all agreed together.&nbsp; And we all agreed not to hurt each other.&#8221;

&#8220;But I didn&#8217;t hurt you.&#8221;

&#8220;Oh, it&#8217;s no use arguing with you.&nbsp; You&#8217;re hopelessly stupid.&nbsp; After all I went through I can&#8217;t even get any sympathy.&#8221;

&#8220;How do you expect to get any sympathy when the first thing you do is call me names?&#8221;

&#8220;God damn fuck everything...&nbsp; I know I&#8217;m being a bitch.&#8221;&nbsp; Ivy&#8217;s anger and frustration seemed to be turning to dejection.&nbsp; &#8220;It&#8217;s just... I feel betrayed by people I depend on.&nbsp; Especially you.&nbsp; ...You know how upsetting it is to feel betrayed.&#8221;&nbsp; Ivy collapsed on the bed, tears in her eyes.

&#8220;Oh-my-god.&nbsp; I&#8217;m sorry,&#8221; said April, sitting down next to her and caressing her.&nbsp; &#8220;I&#8217;m really sorry.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t know why I helped them do that to you.&#8221;

&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry too,&#8221; I added.&nbsp; &#8220;I feel that I&#8217;m the root of the problem.&nbsp; I&#8217;m the one who&#8217;s always feeding the guy&#8217;s expectations for recreational corporal punishment.&#8221;

&#8220;You&#8217;re suffering delusions of importance,&#8221; said Ivy.

I was taken aback, almost feeling that my existence had been dismissed.&nbsp; Hell if I would say another thing to her.

But April said to Ivy, &#8220;That was uncalled for.&nbsp; You&#8217;re being mean again.&nbsp; And besides, I think Jenny has a point.&nbsp; She is the sexual core that keeps this punishment thing going.&#8221;

&#8220;Oh...&nbsp; Well...&nbsp; I&#8217;m sorry I said that.&nbsp; It was bad,&#8221; said Ivy, although not directly to me. &#8220;But I&#8217;m having a terrible day.&nbsp; And I didn&#8217;t sleep well last night.&nbsp; I kept thinking that Jenny&#8217;s trying to set me up to look like the villain.&#8221;

I knew she was talking about my passivity in the face of her bitchiness when she and Rafiq and I were together the previous night.&nbsp; Now I felt guilty, but I kept quiet.&nbsp; I just stared at the floor.

Ivy continued, &#8220;And now, first that awful caning, and then everybody ganging up and beating the shit out of me.&#8221;

I said, &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry you got whipped too hard, but April and I got whipped too.&nbsp; And nobody seems to appreciate what I went through to break this thing up.&nbsp; The Skipper was so mad... the way he thrashed me on the breasts, so hard and fast.&nbsp; It hurt so bad I thought I was going to faint.&nbsp; It still stings,&#8221; I said, rubbing my breasts.

&#8220;Yeah, but you love getting your tits whipped.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t.&nbsp; I&#8217;m just not cut out for this kind of corporal punishment.&nbsp; Today it made me want to hit back, or take it out on someone else.&nbsp; ...Somebody else like you, Jenny.&#8221;&nbsp; Ivy&#8217;s eyes brightened.

&#8220;I don&#8217;t know what you have in mind, but I&#8217;m pretty sure I&#8217;m not interested.&nbsp; I&#8217;ve been punished enough.&#8221;

&#8220;No you haven&#8217;t.&nbsp; James hit me with the cane on the pussy.&nbsp; You can&#8217;t match that.&#8221;

Eeyew.&nbsp; A contest about who had got whipped the worst?&nbsp; How unsavory.&nbsp; But still, I entered into it, saying, &#8220;The Skipper hit me with the strap on the pussy.&nbsp; During my match with April.&#8221;

&#8220;But not the cane.&nbsp; Neither of us will be satisfied until you take a caning on the pussy.&#8221;

&#8220;You&#8217;re out of your mind.&nbsp; The answer is no.&nbsp; Absolutely no, and I&#8217;m not discussing it further.&#8221;

&#8220;Yes you are discussing it further.&nbsp; We have to resolve this thing.&nbsp; If not with the cane, then with the switch.&nbsp; Neither of us will be satisfied until you take a whipping on the pussy.&#8221;

&#8220;Maybe you won&#8217;t be satisfied without it.&nbsp; But how will it satisfy me?&#8221;

&#8220;You know you want to come off.&#8221;

&#8220;That&#8217;s crazy.&nbsp; How could I come off like that?&nbsp; It would hurt too much.&#8221;

&#8220;How do you know.&nbsp; Have you tried it?&#8221;

&#8220;No, but it&#8217;s something I know.&#8221;

&#8220;In other words, you don&#8217;t actually know.&nbsp; And we&#8217;ll never stop arguing until you try it.&nbsp; You&#8217;re going to go out there now and ask the Skipper and Rafiq to let you borrow the switch.&nbsp; You&#8217;re going to tell them that it&#8217;s so we can whip you with it.&#8221;

&#8220;Oh-my-god, no.&nbsp; How humiliating.&nbsp; To have to ask them for the implement you&#8217;re going to beat me with.&#8221;

&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Ivy, her eyes bright, never leaving mine.

I was silent.&nbsp; How could it be that I felt drawn to do it?&nbsp; To go out there and ask them for the switch to bring to Ivy to whip me with.&nbsp; As I imagined it, I could just feel the allure it would give me.&nbsp; ...But if I was going to do it, I would have to do it now, while Rafiq and the Skipper were out there together.

After a moment I said, &#8220;Okay, I&#8217;ll ask them for the switch.&nbsp; But that is all I&#8217;m agreeing to.&#8221;&nbsp; Bringing back the switch did not mean I would let Ivy use it on me.

April said, &#8220;And you&#8217;re going to tell them it&#8217;s to be used on you?&#8221;

&#8220;Yes, that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m going to do.&nbsp; I know it&#8217;s a really goofy thing for me to do.&nbsp; ...Anyway, I have to get a shirt on.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Skipper&#8217;s still got my bikini top.&#8221;

&#8220;No.&nbsp; Just go out like you are,&#8221; said April.&nbsp; &#8220;You&#8217;re cute.&#8221;

I pondered that.&nbsp; The image of me going out there, breasts bare, so naked, so vulnerable, eyes down, so meek, asking so quietly: please sirs, let me borrow the switch so that Ivy can whip me.&nbsp; Me, so enticing, so irresistible.

I replied, &#8220;Well... all right, if that&#8217;s what you think I should do.&nbsp; ...But I feel too plain.&nbsp; I need something... a pendent.&nbsp; My Kuan Yin pendent.&#8221;

Fetching my silver pendent from my stuff, I put it on.&nbsp; Then I went to the door.&nbsp; Hesitating I glanced back at April and Ivy.&nbsp; But no use waiting till I lost my nerve.&nbsp; I opened the door and left, closing it behind me.&nbsp; ...Oops.&nbsp; There was Rafiq coming down the steps dragging all four of the mattress pads we used in wrestling.&nbsp; I had to get out of his way.

&#8220;Hey... Jenny,&#8221; he said, seeming delighted to see me.&nbsp; &#8220;Are you okay?&nbsp; I guess this thing got a little out of hand.&#8221;

Giving him a big smile, I reassured him, &#8220;Yeah, I&#8217;m okay.&nbsp; Thank you for holding back the Skipper.&nbsp; I feel like you saved my life.&nbsp; The way he was whipping me, I thought I was going to die.&#8221;

&#8220;Oh shit.&nbsp; Sorry that happened.&#8221;&nbsp; Dropping the mats across the passageway, he gently put his hands to my breasts, and softly pressed.

&#8220;Mmm.&nbsp; They were hurting, but now you&#8217;ve made them feel better.&nbsp; You have healing hands.&#8221;

Then taking me in his arms, he bent me backwards and kissed each nipple.&nbsp; Long sloppy kisses.&nbsp; Kisses that made me have to press my crotch into his leg.

I murmured, &#8220;And now they&#8217;re feeling really good.&#8221;

&#8220;Want to come to my berth and lie down for a while?&#8221; he said quietly.

But apparently not quietly enough, for an instant later, the compartment door opened and there was Ivy, brow furrowed.&nbsp; &#8220;Well,&#8221; she said, &#8220;what about your errand?&nbsp; Have you become distracted?&#8221;

&#8220;Um...&nbsp; Yeah, I&#8217;m going right now,&#8221; I answered.&nbsp; Then turning to Rafiq I said, &#8220;I need to ask the Skipper for something.&nbsp; And I need for you to come with me.&nbsp; Is that okay?&#8221;

&#8220;Sure.&#8221;&nbsp; He looked at me with a quizzical expression .&nbsp; Then he turned to Ivy and said, &#8220;Are you okay?&nbsp; I guess I deserved that slap you gave me.&nbsp; And probably more than a slap.&nbsp; I shouldn&#8217;t have let that wrestling thing get out of hand.&#8221;

&#8220;I was really upset, but I&#8217;m okay now,&#8221; said Ivy.&nbsp; &#8220;It&#8217;s past.&nbsp; But it makes me feel better that you recognize it was over the top.&nbsp; ...Anyway, yes, maybe sometime we can look into having me dish out more than that slap.&#8221;&nbsp; She gave him an evil grin.

Rafiq laughed and said, &#8220;It might be interesting.&#8221;&nbsp; As she edged closer to him, he brought his lips to hers, but only for a moment.

I tried to show no expression.&nbsp; After all, the kiss he gave her was a whole lot less than the kiss he gave me.

So anyway, parting from Ivy he followed me as I clambered over the mattresses in the passageway, and up the steps to the deck.&nbsp; What was unfolding was already different from the scenario I had imagined.&nbsp; I had wanted to approach Rafiq and the Skipper together so I could direct my request to both of them, even though the switch belonged to the Skipper, not to Rafiq.

Now my request would seem only be to the Skipper.&nbsp; What would Rafiq&#8217;s role be?&nbsp; Was he supposed to be giving me moral support or something?

James was at the helm.&nbsp; The Skipper was tidying up, coiling some rope.&nbsp; When he saw me he stopped what he was doing and watched me approach.&nbsp; His expression was serious, perhaps even uneasy.

Coming up to him, I waited till Rafiq was beside me.&nbsp; The Skipper looked at him, but with a gesture Rafiq indicated that he had no idea what I was up to.&nbsp; I took a step to the side such that Rafiq would be closer to the Skipper than to me.

With both of them now facing me, the situation felt right.&nbsp; I felt so conscious of my nakedness, yet so comfortable with it.&nbsp; I was relishing the feeling of vulnerability.&nbsp; At that moment perhaps I felt as pretty as ever I had felt, if I&#8217;m allowed to admit that here.&nbsp; Meanwhile the Skipper and Rafiq were waiting with expectation.

&#8220;Sir,&#8221; I murmured.&nbsp; &#8220;I... um...&nbsp; May I borrow the switch?&#8221;&nbsp; But I lost my nerve to tell them what for.

I looked up at the Skipper.&nbsp; He looked relieved.&nbsp; Smiling, he asked, &#8220;And what do you need the switch for?&#8221;

I answered, &#8220;Ivy thinks I should be whipped.&#8221;

Smiling broadly, the Skipper said, &#8220;And why does she think that?&#8221;

&#8220;I don&#8217;t know.&nbsp; I guess she thinks I didn&#8217;t get whipped enough.&#8221;

&#8220;After what the Skipper did to your breasts?&#8221; said Rafiq.

&#8220;Hey, in the first match you really put the switch to her tits too,&#8221; said the Skipper.&nbsp; &#8220;April gets her in the full nelson, and you take full advantage of it.&#8221;

&#8220;Well...&nbsp; yeah.&nbsp; But anyway, after all that, you want to be whipped some more?&#8221; Rafiq asked me.

&#8220;Well, actually I only agreed to ask you guys for the switch and tell you she wanted to whip me with it ...sort of like on a dare.&nbsp; But I never told her she could actually use it on me.&nbsp; ...Does that sound silly?&nbsp; Now I&#8217;m feeling like a twit.&#8221;

How quickly a mood can change.&nbsp; I no longer felt irresistibly alluring.&nbsp; I felt foolish ...and too naked.&nbsp; I had an impulse to cover my breasts with my hands.&nbsp; But that would just make me look weaker and sillier.&nbsp; Instead I kept my arms down, elbows straight, and clasped my hands, eyes lowered.&nbsp; No doubt my posture revealed my discomfort.&nbsp; I could feel their eyes on my body.

&#8220;So she feels silly doing what Ivy says and coming to ask us for the switch,&#8221; said the Skipper to Rafiq.

Rafiq replied, &#8220;If she were aware of herself being bold and bewitching, she wouldn&#8217;t be Jenny.&#8221;

I bit my lip but said nothing.&nbsp; I glanced down at my body, the whip marks so conspicuous across my breasts.

&#8220;Right.&#8221;&nbsp; Then the Skipper asked, &#8220;So where does Ivy want to whip you?&#8221;

&#8220;Um... well, in our compartment.&#8221;

The Skipper said, &#8220;Maybe you do need another whipping.&nbsp; You knew what I meant:&nbsp; what part of your body?&#8221;&nbsp; He reached out and touched my breast.

Stepping back out of his reach, I said, &#8220;I don&#8217;t think I need any more, but Ivy thinks I need it between the legs.&nbsp; James caned her there and she&#8217;s pissed off about that.&#8221;

Both guys were looking at my swimsuit bottom.&nbsp; I felt self conscious.

&#8220;And what about the caning Rafiq gave her on the butt?&nbsp; How do you feel about it that you didn&#8217;t get one?&#8221;

&#8220;I hope you&#8217;re not implying that I&#8217;m supposed to be disappointed if I don&#8217;t get whipped more than anyone else.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t know why Ivy volunteered for that.&#8221;

&#8220;So that she could get whipped more than you, obviously.&nbsp; Now you need to catch up.&nbsp; Bend over and we&#8217;ll give it to you.&#8221;

&#8220;But Ivy&#8217;s waiting for me to bring back the switch.&#8221;

&#8220;When did your mistress tell you when you were supposed to be back?&#8221;

&#8220;Ivy is not my mistress.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t take orders from her.&nbsp; And I don&#8217;t think you&#8217;re funny.&#8221;

&#8220;Touchy about it, eh?&nbsp; Well, whatever.&nbsp; How about if we send you back with a few stripes that you can compare with hers?&#8221;

&#8220;Please sir, I don&#8217;t want a caning.&nbsp; I&#8217;ve already been whipped so much.&#8221;

&#8220;No?&nbsp; Then let&#8217;s try this,&#8221; said the Skipper, indicating the rope he had been coiling when I had approached him.&nbsp; Moving behind me, he had me face Rafiq as he set rope across my ribs.&nbsp; Rafiq&#8217;s eyes were glued to my body.&nbsp; I closed my eyes as I felt the rope slide upward, pressing into the base of my breasts.

The Skipper pulled the rope up tightly across my nipples.&nbsp; Then he began dragging it back and forth.&nbsp; Scraped across the areolas, the sensation was stimulating.&nbsp; I clasped Rafiq&#8217;s hands as he stood facing me.

Then the rope scraped across the nub of my nipple.&nbsp; That was a stronger sensation.&nbsp; Too strong.&nbsp; I squirmed.&nbsp; But Rafiq held my hands firmly.

The Skipper continued to scrape the rope across my nipples.&nbsp; The sensation was sometimes too strong.&nbsp; But mostly I tried not to let on that this was stimulating, although my nipples were obviously stiff.

&#8220;This isn&#8217;t strong enough for her,&#8221; said the Skipper.

&#8220;I wasn&#8217;t complaining about it,&#8221; I said.

&#8220;That&#8217;s how we know it&#8217;s not stimulating enough for you.&#8221;

&#8220;She likes a challenge,&#8221; said Rafiq.

&#8220;I think I&#8217;ve been challenged more than enough for one day.&#8221;

&#8220;Then why did you come out here asking for the switch?&#8221; asked Rafiq.

&#8220;Oh, quit badgering me.&#8221;

&#8220;He&#8217;s not badgering you.&nbsp; We just want you to be happy,&#8221; said the Skipper.&nbsp; Then leaving off with the rope, he said, &#8220;I have a better idea.&nbsp; Go get your toothbrush.&#8221;

&#8220;I already brushed my teeth today.&#8221;

Still behind me, the Skipper took hold of my nipples and pinched hard.&nbsp; &#8220;Ow.&nbsp; Ow.&nbsp; Ow.&nbsp; ...I&#8217;ll get my toothbrush,&#8221; I cried.&nbsp; &#8220;Please stop.&#8221;

The Skipper eased his grip slightly, but pulled and jiggled my breasts.&nbsp; When he finally released me, I fell into Rafiq&#8217;s arms.&nbsp; &#8220;Ah... My tits...&#8221;

Rafiq hugged me for a few moments until his hands too went for my breasts.&nbsp; Separating from him, I said, &#8220;I&#8217;ll get my toothbrush now,&#8221; and went down the steps into the cabin.

Before I reached the bathroom, the door of our compartment opened, and Ivy appeared, asking, &#8220;Well, did you get the switch?&#8221;

&#8220;Um...&nbsp; No, I don&#8217;t have it yet.&nbsp; But I did ask them for it, and I told them you wanted to use it on me.&nbsp; ...So I&#8217;ve actually done everything I agreed to do.&#8221;

&#8220;That&#8217;s really lame.&nbsp; When are you going to bring the switch?&#8221;

&#8220;When they give it to me.&nbsp; Or if.&#8221;

&#8220;What are you doing now?&nbsp; What&#8217;s the deal about your toothbrush?&#8221;

&#8220;Well, since you seem to be listening to what&#8217;s going on, you know as much as me.&#8221;

&#8220;I have better things to do than to take notice of your doings.&#8221;

&#8220;Like what?&#8221; I asked.

Touche.&nbsp; But both of us laughed.&nbsp; Grinning, Ivy said, &#8220;Girl, you&#8217;re going to get what&#8217;s coming to you.&#8221;

&#8220;Maybe so,&#8221; I said, and turned into the bathroom to fetch my toothbrush.

Returning to the deck with my toothbrush, I presented it to Rafiq and the Skipper.&nbsp; The Skipper took it and said, &#8220;Now hold your arms straight up over your head and cross your wrists.&#8221;

I did as he said.&nbsp; It was as if I were bound by the wrists, arms over head.&nbsp; Shifting my hips slightly to one side, I felt very sexy.&nbsp; One glance at Rafiq and I could tell he was entranced.

Standing behind me, one arm across my chest, his hand squeezing my breast, the Skipper held me.&nbsp; With his other hand he put the toothbrush to my ribs and starting scrubbing my skin with it.&nbsp; The sensation was intense.&nbsp; Not quite painful, but close.&nbsp; I squirmed.

&#8220;How does that feel,&#8221; asked the Skipper.

&#8220;It&#8217;s okay.&nbsp; But it&#8217;s strong.&#8221;&nbsp; I was breathing hard, squirming as he scrubbed on my ribs and stomach.

&#8220;Here.&nbsp; Take a turn with it,&#8221; he said to Rafiq.

Taking the toothbrush, Rafiq nudged Skipper&#8217;s hand and forearm down off my breasts.&nbsp; He then scrubbed it across the base of breasts.&nbsp; Closer and closer to my nipples.&nbsp; I knew what was coming.

Finally, he set on my left nipple and scrubbed in a circle around the areola.

&#8220;Ooh,&#8221; I gasped.&nbsp; &#8220;That&#8217;s like... ooh.&#8221;&nbsp; Still, I kept my arms over my head, wrists together.&nbsp; But I couldn&#8217;t help squirming.

Still he scrubbed around my nipple with it.&nbsp; &#8220;Ooh...&nbsp; What are you doing to me?&#8221;&nbsp; ...Trenchant.&nbsp; Erotic.&nbsp; Almost painful.

Then he raked it across the nub of my nipple.&nbsp; Too much.&nbsp; I brought my arms down to protect myself.&nbsp; &#8220;Oh please.&nbsp; It&#8217;s too much.&#8221;

&#8220;You want me to stop?&#8221;

I hesitated, then admitted, &#8220;No.&nbsp; But...&#8221;

Rafiq then applied the brush to my other nipple.&nbsp; The sensation was so penetrating.&nbsp; Then it was the Skipper&#8217;s hand I felt sliding down my belly, slipping into my swimsuit bottom, down beyond my mons, and onto my clit.&nbsp; I could not help pressing my body to meet his caress.&nbsp; I wanted more.

On and on the two of them drove my body.&nbsp; &#8220;Ooh...&nbsp; Ahh...&#8221;&nbsp; I gasped with the intensity of the erotic sensations.&nbsp; The trenchant pain-pleasure scouring of my nipples, and the pure-pleasure stimulation of my clit.&nbsp; My arousal was filling to the brim.

Rafiq again raked the toothbrush too hard across the nub of my nipple.&nbsp; As I wreathed away, he grabbed my body and said, &#8220;Turn around.&nbsp; Bend over and hold the bulkhead.&#8221;&nbsp; As I turned to the bulkhead, he pulled my swimsuit bottom off.&nbsp; Now completely naked, ready to be fucked.&nbsp; And I wanted it.

Arms straight out, I grasped the bulkhead, bending over, legs apart.&nbsp; His penis, big as a log, penetrated into me.&nbsp; Advancing up my tunnel, all the way in, his loins tight against my butt.

Turning my head toward the Skipper, I saw his stiff penis waiting to enter my mouth.&nbsp; I did not refuse it.&nbsp; First attacking the glans with my tongue, I then opened and took it in.&nbsp; Sucking, tonguing, sucking, tonguing.

Entered from both ends at once for the first time ever, and I reveled in the depravity of it.&nbsp; On and on I continued, arousal teetering just short of climax.&nbsp; But I couldn&#8217;t quite get there.&nbsp; The tactile impetus was wanting.&nbsp; Rear entry leaves my clit without adequate stimulation.&nbsp; And now my nipples were being neglected, having previously been harried into a frenzy of stimulation.

After a time, Rafiq, thrusting hard, began grunting bullishly, venting his life-force energy into me.&nbsp; Several moments later the Skipper, voicing a guttural rumble, began disgorging his vital oils into my mouth.&nbsp; One spurt after another they rode out their climax, emptying their potencies into me.

Yet I, the recipient of all this male vigor, could not quite release my own pent up sexual pressure.&nbsp; Still, as I did my utmost to satisfy them, I remained confident that when they were done with theirs, they would make sure that I got mine.&nbsp; After all, these are two guys who have had a fixation on my orgasms.&nbsp; They would not leave me high and dry.

Gradually their exertions subsided.&nbsp; Rafiq and I remained joined while the Skipper took his penis out of my mouth.&nbsp; I was unsure whether I was supposed to spit or swallow the salty fluid.&nbsp; Still bent over, holding the bulkhead, it was dribbling out of my mouth.

It was then that I heard the footfall coming up the steps.&nbsp; Before I even looked, I knew it was Ivy.&nbsp; She glanced in our direction and acknowledged us as if everything were perfectly normal.&nbsp; Rafiq disengaged from me, and I straightened up, trying to be discrete about spitting over the bulkhead and wiping my mouth.

Awkward, awkward, awkward, that&#8217;s how I felt.&nbsp; Ivy, now wearing shorts and came tank top, seemed to be making a point of eying my nakedness.&nbsp; I felt that her mein was expressing disdain.&nbsp; I felt very exposed, but I did not want to show weakness.

With my bikini bottom tangled on one of my ankles, I felt I looked comically cheap.&nbsp; But I didn&#8217;t want to bend over to put it on.&nbsp; Instead, keeping head high I lifted it with my foot, grasping it with my hand from behind.&nbsp; But I just held onto it without putting it on.&nbsp; My eyes met Ivy&#8217;s.&nbsp; Her expression registered faint amusement.&nbsp; I reciprocated with an embarrassed smile.

Rafiq broke the silence, &#8220;Jenny, you wanted to borrow something?&#8221;

&#8220;Um... Yes, I did.&nbsp; The switch.&#8221;

With a mischievous grin, the Skipper asked, &#8220;And what did you want the switch for?&#8221;

I looked at Ivy.&nbsp; She was eyeing me expectantly.&nbsp; I had to say it in front of her.&nbsp; &#8220;Ivy wants to whip me with it.&#8221;

The Skipper said, &#8220;You&#8217;ve already had quite a whipping today, especially on the front.&nbsp; What part of your body does she want to whip now?&#8221;

Ivy continued to watch me expectantly.&nbsp; I was not going to back down from the challenge.&nbsp; I said, &#8220;Ivy imagines she&#8217;s going whip me on the pussy.&#8221;

As I said that, I could feel gooey cum dribbling down my leg.&nbsp; Now it seemed that all eyes were watching it leaking out of me.&nbsp; I felt so trashy.

Producing the switch, the Skipper said, &#8220;Here you go, Jenny.&nbsp; Brave girl.&nbsp; ...And here, take this coil of rope too.&nbsp; It might come in handy.&#8221;

&#8220;Shall we go?&#8221; Ivy asked me, as she turned toward the cabin.

&#8220;Are we invited?&#8221; asked Rafiq, with a smile.

&#8220;No,&#8221; said Ivy.&nbsp; &#8220;You&#8217;ve had enough fun at our expense today.&#8221;

As Ivy went down the steps, I stayed where I was, holding the switch and rope.&nbsp; I was not comfortable with the implication that Ivy was ordering me about... or that I had actually agreed to another whipping.

Before entering the cabin, Ivy looked back at me.&nbsp; I thought she looked indignant that I was not following.

The Skipper said, &#8220;You know, Ivy, Jenny&#8217;s disappointed that you got a good caning and she didn&#8217;t.&nbsp; I think she might want to stay out here so that we can remedy that.&#8221;

What an annoying thing to say.&nbsp; Now I felt I had little choice but to leave.&nbsp; Saying, &#8220;That&#8217;s not true at all.&nbsp; But if you&#8217;ll excuse me, I have to use the bathroom,&#8221; I followed Ivy into the cabin.

I did stop first at the bathroom, both to pee and to clean off the cum.&nbsp; That done, I wondered if I could release my pent up sexual tension.&nbsp; I tried fingering myself, but was too distracted hearing Rafiq talking to Ivy and April while setting up the mattresses in our compartment.&nbsp; When those conversations ended, I found the milieu of the cramped bathroom not to be conducive.&nbsp; Finally I gave it up.

Still in no hurry to leave this refuge, I played around for a while with Ivy&#8217;s eye liner, adding a bit of accent to my eyes, without being over-dramatic.&nbsp; Finally, having run out of reasons for staying in the bathroom, put on my bikini bottom and left.

The door to our compartment was locked.&nbsp; I had to knock.&nbsp; April let me in.&nbsp; She had changed into a sleeveless top and a skirt.&nbsp; And Ivy now had on a long dress with a beautiful purple pattern, much more elegant attire than anyone had bothered with during this voyage.&nbsp; Their dressing up was obviously Ivy&#8217;s idea for putting my bare-breasted nakedness into a stark and humble contrast with them.

On letting me in, April immediately said, &#8220;Ooh, look at Jenny.&nbsp; Swe-eet!&nbsp; I bet you haven&#8217;t worn makeup since the graduation all-night party.&#8221;&nbsp; She put her arm around me.

&#8220;Eye makeup or not, it seems that I&#8217;m a bit underdressed.&#8221;

Ivy said, &#8220;Our manner of attire is not for you to share.&nbsp; You&#8217;re here to be whipped, naked.&nbsp; So hand over the switch.&nbsp; You&#8217;ll be whipped extra to taking so long in bringing it.&#8221;

Dropping the switch and the rope, and reciprocating April&#8217;s soft embrace, I said, &#8220;I&#8217;m more up for something gentle.&nbsp; Those guys just finished using me.&nbsp; They got theirs but I never got to come off.&#8221;

I didn&#8217;t actually feel that they had used me.&nbsp; I felt that I hadn&#8217;t been able to tell them what I needed before Ivy had come and interrupted us.&nbsp; But with Ivy I felt a need to portray myself as blameless for my intercourse with Rafiq.

&#8220;So you&#8217;re really up for a whipping now so you can come off good,&#8221; said Ivy picking up the switch.&nbsp; &#8220;Lie down on the floor.&#8221;

Now wrapping both arms around April, I said, &#8220;I don&#8217;t want to do that.&nbsp; I&#8217;ve been whipped enough for one day.&#8221;&nbsp; Yet I couldn&#8217;t help wondering if a whipping would get me to come off.

As April and I embraced, Ivy tapped the switch on my rear end.&nbsp; &#8220;Tell me how this feels,&#8221; she said.&nbsp; Swat!&nbsp; She hit on the rear of my swimsuit.&nbsp; The switch is too light and thin to make much impression through fabric.

After hitting me three more times through my swimsuit, she said, &#8220;This only works on bare skin, doesn&#8217;t it?&#8221;&nbsp; Sswit!&nbsp; Sswit!&nbsp; Sswit!&nbsp; Stinging the back of the thighs.

&#8220;Ah!&nbsp; I can feel that.&#8221;

Sswit!&nbsp; Sswit!&nbsp; Sswit!&nbsp; Ivy kept laying them on hard and fast.&nbsp; Gasping and writhing, I held on to April, as Ivy stung me over and over.&nbsp; &#8220;Ow.&nbsp; Ow.&nbsp; Ow!&#8221;

When finally she paused, I let go of April and rubbed the backs of my thighs.&nbsp; &#8220;Oh-my-god, that stings.&nbsp; So now we&#8217;re even.&nbsp; That&#8217;s got to be every bit as bad as that caning you took.&#8221;

&#8220;Shit no, we&#8217;re not even.&nbsp; You&#8217;ve got nothing to match the marks on my butt.&#8221;

&#8220;But the switch is different from the cane.&nbsp; You can&#8217;t compare marks.&nbsp; You know how much the switch hurts even though it doesn&#8217;t mark you up as much.&#8221;

&#8220;You have a long way to go before you catch up with all that I took today.&#8221;

&#8220;Ivy, this is a really fucked-up thing to get in a contest about.&nbsp; I am not engaging in any more arguments about who got whipped the worst today.&nbsp; If you want to think you got it worse than me, then fine, I&#8217;m not going to try to change your mind.&nbsp; ...But you just don&#8217;t know what I went through when the Skipper gave me a switching on the breasts.&#8221;

April interjected, &#8220;First you say you&#8217;re not going to try to change her mind.&nbsp; Then you try to convince her about how bad you got whipped on the breasts.&nbsp; You&#8217;re making as much of a contest out of it as Ivy is.&#8221;

&#8220;Oh shit.&nbsp; I guess I am.&nbsp; ...But it was like such a surreal experience.&nbsp; Even after Rafiq held back the Skipper... I was sitting on that mat, so overwhelmed with pain.&nbsp; Like totally disoriented.&nbsp; Panting, just trying to keep myself from fainting.&nbsp; And Ivy&#8217;s doing this weird scene, slapping Rafiq and going after James and cussing them all out.&nbsp; And all the time I&#8217;m just trying to figure out what&#8217;s happening to me.&nbsp; ...It was like this alternate reality.&#8221;

Ivy said, &#8220;Oh Jenny, you&#8217;re such a dramatist.&nbsp; Everybody knows you have a really high pain threshold.&#8221;

&#8220;I do not.&nbsp; I think I have a low pain threshold.&nbsp; I think you have a higher pain threshold than I do.&#8221;

April interjected, &#8220;This is dumb.&nbsp; None of us can judge the other person&#8217;s pain threshold.&nbsp; But Jenny, you&#8217;ve always been sort of a stoic about things you&#8217;ve set your mind to accept.&nbsp; And you have to admit that you respond sexually to pain.&#8221;

&#8220;Well, I can&#8217;t help that.&nbsp; ...Hey.&nbsp; Wait a minute.&nbsp; You&#8217;re really exaggerating.&nbsp; It&#8217;s only certain rare situations.&nbsp; I certainly don&#8217;t go looking for painful experiences.&#8221;

Ivy said, &#8220;We know you didn&#8217;t ask me for a whipping on the pussy.&nbsp; But I&#8217;m going give you one anyway.&nbsp; I&#8217;m going to make you come off.&#8221;&nbsp; Then she reached and felt between my legs.&nbsp; &#8220;Are you still dripping Rafiq&#8217;s juices?&#8221;

&#8220;They took advantage of me,&#8221; I said.&nbsp; But I knew that was so lame that I couldn&#8217;t quite keep a straight face.

&#8220;You let them take advantage of you,&#8221; said Ivy.

&#8220;Actually, I think she seduced them,&#8221; said April, laughing.

&#8220;You deserve to have your pussy whipped.&nbsp; Now on the floor and take what&#8217;s coming to you.&#8221;

&#8220;I&#8217;m not doing it if you&#8217;re just going to whip the shit out me.&#8221;

&#8220;But I said I&#8217;m going to make you come off.&#8221;

Looking at April, I asked, &#8220;What should I do?&nbsp; How do I know she&#8217;s not going to see how much she can hurt me?&#8221;

As she looked to Ivy, April seemed uncertain.&nbsp; Ivy said, &#8220;Either Jenny&#8217;s not so brave as some people think.&nbsp; Or else she knows that what she really deserves is a pussy whipping so horrendous she&#8217;ll never want to fuck again.&#8221;&nbsp; Then looking into my eyes, she said, &#8220;You&#8217;ll just have to trust that I&#8217;ll do better by you than you would by me.&#8221;

&#8220;But I&#8217;ve never wanted to punish you.&nbsp; That one time it was the Skipper who made me use the cane and switch on you.&#8221;

&#8220;I&#8217;m not talking about that.&nbsp; I&#8217;m talking about last night when we were with Rafiq.&nbsp; You were scheming to make me look like a witch.&#8221;

&#8220;Well...&nbsp; I wasn&#8217;t scheming.&nbsp; It was just a natural way for me to deal with your anger.&#8221;

&#8220;But you admit you were trying to make me look bad.&#8221;

&#8220;Well, I&#8217;m sorry about that.&nbsp; Maybe I could have found a way that was more helpful to both of us.&nbsp; ...I don&#8217;t know.&#8221;

April interjected, &#8220;Ivy, were you also trying to make Jenny look bad?&#8221;

&#8220;Well, yeah, but she was being obnoxious.&nbsp; Running out there half naked to get Rafiq&#8217;s attention.&#8221;

&#8220;But just now you sent me out there half naked...&#8221;

&#8220;That was April&#8217;s dumb idea for you to go topless.&nbsp; And look what happened.&nbsp; You got Rafiq to fuck you, you slut.&nbsp; You knew that would piss me off.&nbsp; And that&#8217;s why you deserve a pussy whipping.&nbsp; You&#8217;ll just have to trust that it won&#8217;t be as bad as you deserve.&nbsp; ...Now you obey me.&nbsp; Rafiq couldn&#8217;t bring you off, but I can.&nbsp; Just do what I say.&nbsp; On the floor.&#8221;

I realized now that I would do as she said.&nbsp; She was going to whip me and make me come off.&nbsp; Yes, it seemed depraved, but that just added to its allure.&nbsp; And since I had no intention of letting them tie me up, I could end it if it wasn&#8217;t going well.

I sat down, hands on the floor behind me, legs outstretched.&nbsp; &#8220;So what do you want me to do?&#8221;

&#8220;April, strip her the rest of the way.&#8221;

&#8220;Um...&nbsp; I don&#8217;t know about you ordering me about in that tone of voice,&#8221; she replied.

Ivy looked at April for a moment, then said, &#8220;You&#8217;re undermining my mind state.&nbsp; How can I be a dominatrix when you do that?&nbsp; Jenny has to do what I say because I&#8217;ve got the switch.&nbsp; But you&#8217;ve got to help me or I can&#8217;t do it right.&#8221;

&#8220;Oh...&nbsp; Okay, no problem.&#8221;&nbsp; Then she added, &#8220;Madam,&#8221; and laughed.

I smiled at that, but Ivy touched the switch to my cheek and said, &#8220;Wipe that smirk off your face.&#8221;

As I smothered my smile, April knelt and tugged on my swimsuit bottom.&nbsp; I lifted my butt off the floor and she slid it off me.&nbsp; Now I was completely naked, with Ivy standing over me with the switch.&nbsp; Feeling vulnerable, I awaited my fate.&nbsp; I had a flashback of the last time Ivy had held the switch over me: the time she whipped me so hard I had fainted.

&#8220;How do you feel now, being naked and waiting for your whipping?&nbsp; Are you afraid?&nbsp; Have a sense of foreboding?&#8221;

&#8220;I know you&#8217;re going to make it hurt.&#8221;

&#8220;You&#8217;re right about that.&nbsp; Now raise your legs.&#8221;

Leaning back, I raised my feet.&nbsp; Ivy took hold of my left ankle.&nbsp; April took hold of my right.&nbsp; They spread my legs wide apart.&nbsp; Ivy slid the switch up and down the inside of my thighs.&nbsp; Then she touched it into my slit and tapped side-to-side on my labia.&nbsp; I bit my lip, anticipating what was to come.

Withdrawing the switch from my pussy, she put it to my mouth and said, &#8220;Kiss it.&nbsp; Kiss the implement that&#8217;s going to inflict your pain.&#8221;

&#8220;Yes madam,&#8221; I said, although I couldn&#8217;t suppress a little smile as I said it.&nbsp; I appreciated Ivy&#8217;s effort to put on a real exhibition as my disciplinarian.

After I had kissed it, Ivy drew back the switch.&nbsp; Sswit!&nbsp; She snapped it onto the inside of my thigh.&nbsp; I gasped.&nbsp; ...Sswit!&nbsp; Sswit!&nbsp; Sswit!&nbsp; She laid on stroke after stroke, flaying the most sensitive part of my thighs.

The way it stung, I couldn&#8217;t help jerking my legs, although not hard enough for either Ivy or April to lose their grip on me.

&#8220;Stop kicking,&#8221; said Ivy.&nbsp; &#8220;Take the whipping you deserve.&#8221;&nbsp; ...Sswit!&nbsp; Sswit!&nbsp; Sswit!

&#8220;Ow.&nbsp; Ow.&nbsp; Ow.&nbsp; ...I can&#8217;t help it.&nbsp; That really stings.&#8221;

&#8220;That&#8217;s nothing compared to what&#8217;s coming.&nbsp; Now are you sorry you were out there fucking with my boyfriend?&#8221;

&#8220;It wasn&#8217;t my fault.&#8221;&nbsp; Letting my mind flow with fantasy I said, &#8220;He raped me.&nbsp; When I asked him for the switch so you could whip me, he raped me instead.&nbsp; Can&#8217;t you keep his animalistic desires satisfied?&#8221;

&#8220;You little liar.&#8221;&nbsp; ...Sswit!&nbsp; Sswit!&nbsp; Sswit!&nbsp; Sswit!&nbsp; Sswit!&nbsp; Hard and fast, right on the labia.

&#8220;EEEEEEE!&#8221; I let out a shriek, and kicking my left leg out of her grip, twisted away from her.&nbsp; &#8220;Ow-ow-ow.&nbsp; Fuck.&nbsp; That hurts!&#8221;

&#8220;You little bitch.&nbsp; I told you not to kick.&nbsp; How dare you defy me?&#8221;

&#8220;You were really hurting me.&nbsp; I couldn&#8217;t help it.&#8221;

Picking up the rope, Ivy said, &#8220;Then we&#8217;re going to have to tie your legs apart.&nbsp; Here, get up and put a mattress under you too.&#8221;

April released my other leg, and I got up and pulled a mattress onto the floor.&nbsp; Lying down on it, I let Ivy and April tie each of my ankles, pull my legs up, and suspend them wide apart from the upper berth hardware.

&#8220;Roll a little to the side so I can tie your wrists behind you.&nbsp; Should have done that first.&nbsp; Got to keep your hands out the way.&#8221;

I hesitated.&nbsp; Did I really want to be completely at Ivy&#8217;s mercy?&nbsp; ...But why not?&nbsp; If I could entrust myself to guys who were mostly ignorant of what my body is about, why couldn&#8217;t I entrust myself to Ivy when her peevishness was moderated by April?

&#8220;In for a penny, in for a pound,&#8221; I said as I allowed her to bind my wrists behind me.&nbsp; She seemed pleased that I had acquiesced.

&#8220;Good girl,&#8221; said Ivy, petting my cheek.&nbsp; &#8220;How does that feel?&#8221;

&#8220;Better,&#8221; I replied.&nbsp; Compared to leaning back, supporting myself with my arms, it was obvious that this position was vastly more conducive.&nbsp; Lying on a mattress, bound helpless, I could already feel my sexuality flowing.

&#8220;Now I&#8217;m going to whip your pussy for always trying to get Rafiq to fuck you, you little slut.&#8221;

Sswit!&nbsp; &#8220;Ooooh!&#8221;&nbsp; ...Sswit!&nbsp; &#8220;Ahhhh!&#8221;&nbsp; ...Sswit!&nbsp; Right on the clit.&nbsp; &#8220;Ow!&nbsp; Fuck.&nbsp; That hurt.&#8221;&nbsp; ...Then again.&nbsp; Sswit!&nbsp; &#8220;AHHH!&#8221;&nbsp; ...And yet again, same place.&nbsp; Sswit!&nbsp; &#8220;AHHHH!&nbsp; No more.&#8221;&nbsp; I was gasping and writhing with pain.

&#8220;Now are you sorry for seducing Rafiq?&#8221;

Through the pain, I tried to consider my answer.&nbsp; I loved Rafiq.&nbsp; No way I would flat-out surrender.&nbsp; Catching my breath, I said, &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry I&#8217;ve made you angry.&#8221;

&#8220;Well that&#8217;s nice gesture, but I asked if you were sorry for seducing Rafiq.&#8221;

&#8220;I never seduced Rafiq.&#8221;

Sswit!&nbsp; &#8220;OOOH!&#8221; ...Sswit!&nbsp; &#8220;AHHHH!&#8221; ...Sswit!&nbsp; &#8220;AHHHH!&#8221;

&#8220;I saw you fucking with him.&#8221;

&#8220;That wasn&#8217;t my fault.&nbsp; Believe me, I don&#8217;t give him any encouragement.&nbsp; But every time he sees me, he turns into an animal.&nbsp; And there&#8217;s nothing I can do about it.&#8221;

&#8220;You fucking little liar.&#8221;&nbsp; Sswit!&nbsp; Sswit!&nbsp; Sswit!

 &#8220;AHHHHH!&nbsp; My god, not there!&#8221;&nbsp; Three in rapid succession, right on the clit.&nbsp; &#8220;Oh fuck, that hurt.&nbsp; Oh-my-god, why are you hurting me this bad?&#8221;

&#8220;You know why.&#8221;&nbsp; Sswit!

&#8220;Ow!&nbsp; ...No I don&#8217;t.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t even know why Rafiq likes me so much, except...&#8221;

&#8220;That pisses me off even more, because I don&#8217;t know why Rafiq likes you either, you worthless little bitch.&#8221;

Sswit!&nbsp; &#8220;OOOH!&#8221;

&#8220;You&#8217;re not as beautiful as me, are you?&#8221;

&#8220;No I&#8217;m not.&nbsp; I&#8217;m just more exciting, engaging, and enchanting.&#8221;

Sswit!&nbsp; Sswit!&nbsp; Sswit!

&#8220;Ow! Ow! Ow!&nbsp; Oh-my-god, don&#8217;t.&nbsp;&nbsp; ...I&#8217;m sorry I said that.&#8221;

Tied up, legs wide apart is not the time to for such direct verbal sparing with someone holding a switch.&nbsp; I had to change course. &#8220;Actually, I don&#8217;t even know if he likes me any more.&nbsp; It&#8217;s just that he turns into a maniacal beast when he sees me.&nbsp; What can I do about that?&nbsp; I can&#8217;t help being what I am physically.&#8221;

...Sswit!&nbsp; Sswit!&nbsp; Sswit!

&#8220;OOOOOH!&#8221;&nbsp; Gasping with pain, I said, &#8220;You promised you weren&#8217;t just going to beat the shit out of me.&nbsp; You promised to make me come off.&#8221;

April responded by putting her lips to mine.&nbsp; Extending her hand, she took hold of the middle of the inside of my thigh opposite her, effectively blocking the path of Ivy&#8217;s switch.

Using the switch instead to prod at my clit, Ivy said, &#8220;You&#8217;re good to whip.&nbsp; That&#8217;s your only distinction.&nbsp; It&#8217;s the only thing Rafiq sees in you.&#8221;

Switch or no, I could not accept that from Ivy.&nbsp; Turning my face from April&#8217;s kiss, I replied, &#8220;That&#8217;s not true.&nbsp; He fell for me before he ever saw me get any of that.&#8221;

&#8220;He didn&#8217;t have to see it.&nbsp; Somehow he could feel your vibes.&nbsp; Your sacrificial vibes.&nbsp; Somehow he knew you&#8217;d be at your best in the agony of punishment.&#8221;&nbsp; Then pushing April&#8217;s arm out of the way, Ivy whacked me hard, right on clit.&nbsp; Sswit!&nbsp; Sswit!&nbsp; Sswit!

&#8220;AHHHHH!&nbsp; ...God.&nbsp; ...No more.&#8221;&nbsp; I was reaching my limit.&nbsp; &#8220;April, don&#8217;t let her do that.&#8221;

Ivy said, &#8220;Admit that your sole virtue is that you&#8217;re good to whip, and I&#8217;ll let you come off instead of punishing you.

&#8220;No.&nbsp; I&#8217;ll never say such a thing about myself.&nbsp; ...April, don&#8217;t let her keep hitting me.&#8221;

April responded by putting her hand directly over my pussy, giving me protection.&nbsp; ...Ooh, but she was slipping her finger into my tunnel.&nbsp; &#8220;Mmm.&nbsp; Nice and moist,&#8221; she said.&nbsp; Then she put her lips to my nipple.

Ivy said, &#8220;Okay, you don&#8217;t have to say it&#8217;s your sole virtue.&nbsp; Just say it&#8217;s one of your qualities.&nbsp; Then I&#8217;ll do what you&#8217;re craving for.&#8221;

I pondered that.&nbsp; Then I said, &#8220;Well...&nbsp; All right.&nbsp; Maybe I can say that.&nbsp; Besides being exciting, engaging, and enchanting&nbsp; ...and also being a nice person&nbsp; ...besides all that, I&#8217;m also good to whip. ...There.&nbsp; Are you satisfied?&#8221;

&#8220;I didn&#8217;t ask for an enumeration of all the qualities you wish you had,&#8221; said Ivy, tapping the switch on April&#8217;s hand, still covering my pussy.&nbsp; &#8220;I think you named about four things that don&#8217;t apply to you, and each of them has earned you an extra six stokes, twenty-four strokes total.&nbsp; But before I administer them, I want you to tell me how you need to be whipped so you can come off.&nbsp; Say you can&#8217;t come off unless you get whipped.&#8221;

&#8220;No.&nbsp; That&#8217;s not true.&#8221;&nbsp; I had begun moving rhythmically in response to April&#8217;s mouth on my nipple, the pressure of her hand on my clit, and her finger probing up me.

Sliding the switch up and down the inside of my thigh, Ivy said, &#8220;Yeah, it&#8217;s true.&nbsp; When have you recently come off without being whipped?&#8221;

&#8220;Um... well...&#8221;&nbsp; I didn&#8217;t want to bring up late night encounters with Rafiq.&nbsp; Instead I said, &#8220;How about that first night we shared this room.&nbsp; You were directly involved.&nbsp; And don&#8217;t claim that I was faking an orgasm.&#8221;

Still sliding the switch up and down the inside of my thigh as I moved rhythmically in response to April&#8217;s continued stimulation, Ivy said, &#8220;Well...&nbsp; I&#8217;m sure you were having a fantasy about being whipped.&#8221;

&#8220;Whatever,&#8221; I replied, now wanting to end this distracting conversation.&nbsp; &#8220;Like, who cares?&#8221;

Unlatching from my nipple, April said, &#8220;Even now, she still likes to sass the madam.&#8221;&nbsp; She removed her hand protecting from my pussy but latched back onto my nipple.&nbsp; Then she put just her finger over my slit, pressing on my clit.

Ivy replied, &#8220;But I agree with Jenny, none of that matters.&nbsp; What matters now is that I&#8217;m giving you the punishment you deserve.&nbsp; And you know you deserve this, right?&#8221;

&#8220;Whether I deserve it or not, I still don&#8217;t think I can come off when you&#8217;re hitting me on the pussy.&#8221;

Sswit!&nbsp; To the inside of the thigh.&nbsp; &#8220;Oooh.&#8221;

Sswit!&nbsp; &#8220;Ahhhh.&#8221;

Sswit!&nbsp; &#8220;Ahhhh.&#8221;

A measured, steady pace, stroke after stroke to the inside of the thighs.&nbsp; This must be the whipping I deserved for seducing Rafiq.&nbsp; What if I were a female so captivating, so beautiful that other females couldn&#8217;t help wanting to punish me?&nbsp; If so, I would have to be dauntless in my acceptance.&nbsp; Let her do her worst.

Pausing her strokes, Ivy said, &#8220;Bitch, from now on this is the only way you&#8217;re allowed to fuck.&#8221;&nbsp; Putting her moistened&nbsp; finger to my asshole, she started pressing it in.

&#8220;Don&#8217;t do that,&#8221; I moaned, tightening up against her.&nbsp; But I couldn&#8217;t keep her finger out.&nbsp; She slid it in and held it there.&nbsp; Never before had I been fucked up the ass.&nbsp; Such an indignity.&nbsp; She had found a new way to bring me down.

Yet the sensation, to my surprise, was not repugnant.&nbsp; Once past the initial shock, I could not deny that it was erotically stimulating.

Although the thought of letting someone stick their finger up my butt was alien to me, it roused a memory of young adolescence.&nbsp; I had been curled in a soft chair, engaged in sexual fantasy and playing with myself, not around my clit but around my anus.&nbsp; The sensation had brought me to climax, my first ever experience of it.

Now my mind was gliding.&nbsp; After tying me down and giving me a dreadful whipping, these women were going make me embrace my punishment by experiencing a butt-fucking orgasm.&nbsp; This was their revenge for my being so alluring that I could steal Rafiq away from his long-time girl friend.&nbsp; For this, it was fitting that these women should torment me.

April sucking my nipple and frigging my clit.&nbsp; Ivy with her wily finger fucking me up the butt.&nbsp; I surrendered to letting them work their perverse will upon me.

Native sexual plasma, hot and crude, glowed within my loins.&nbsp; Writhing with desire, I wanted this to flow on forever and a day.&nbsp; This felt like the be-all, end-all of existence.&nbsp; ...But oh-my-god, it was starting to burst.&nbsp; Nothing could hold it back now.

Pulsing, pulsing, pulsing, the pent-up pressure of sexual magma belched forth.&nbsp; The heat of carnal pleasure fluxed through every sinew.&nbsp; Moaning with ecstasy as April worked her bright magic on my nipple and clit, and Ivy her dark magic up my butt.

Yes.&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; Orgasmic satisfaction.&nbsp; Finally I got what I wanted ...what I needed.&nbsp; Convulsing with pleasure, I journeyed to the ends of existence, transcended its bounds, sampled the limitlessness beyond, and slowly returned again.

As my moans and peals tempered, April eased her suck on my nipple.&nbsp; The pressure of her finger on my clit quieted.&nbsp; Ivy stayed the motion of her finger and after a time withdrew it from my butt.

Yet even before the orgasm had fully wound down, in the back of my mind I sensed a twinge of guilt about an addiction to rough and depraved sex.&nbsp; Couldn&#8217;t I get sexual gratification without submitting to this kind of treatment?

After a minute or so, I said, &#8220;I&#8217;m ready to be untied.&#8221;

April drew back and sat up, looking at Ivy.&nbsp; But Ivy said, &#8220;I&#8217;ll decide when you&#8217;re ready to be untied.&nbsp; And it won&#8217;t be till you&#8217;ve pleasured me.&#8221;

Ivy stood up.&nbsp; Under her long skirt she was taking down her panties.&nbsp; Then she stood over my head, facing my feet.&nbsp; She fluffed out her skirt, and as she knelt down to straddle my head, I watched her crotch approaching my face.

Turning my head aside, I said, &#8220;I think I could do a better job if you&#8217;d just untie me and let me up.&#8221;

&#8220;I don&#8217;t think so,&#8221; said Ivy as her weight came down on the side of my head.&nbsp; &#8220;And I set the rules now.&nbsp; I gave you what you want.&nbsp; Now you give me what I want, the way I want it.&nbsp; Get to work with your tongue.&#8221;&nbsp; She tapped firmly on my clit with the switch.

I had to do her bidding.&nbsp; Turning my face to her as she readjusted her weight, I put out my tongue and got busy at my task.&nbsp; Her crotch was mashing my face.&nbsp; I felt so claustrophobic.&nbsp; Why had I let myself get into this position?

To make things worse, she continued toying with my pussy with the switch, and every now and then laid on a stinging stroke with it, right where it would hurt the most.&nbsp; Nevertheless, I applied all my diligence to working her with my tongue, knowing that this was not going to end until she came off.

After what seemed like an eternity, punctuated with at least half a dozen sharp stinging switch strokes to my pussy, my efforts finally bore fruit.&nbsp; Grinding her crotch hard into my face, Ivy came off, and after another minute or so, rolled off me and lay down on the mattress beside me, a disengaged sixty-nine, her hips by my head.&nbsp; There she lay, gently caressing my stomach.

&#8220;I&#8217;m still ready to be untied,&#8221; I said.

&#8220;So roll over a bit, and I&#8217;ll undo your hands,&#8221; said April.&nbsp; &#8220;Unless the madam objects.&#8221;

Ivy merely lay there caressing my stomach and ribs.&nbsp; &#8220;Mmm.&nbsp; Nice.&#8221;&nbsp; She purred.&nbsp; &#8220;Sweet girl.&nbsp; And pretty slave.&#8221;











Chapter 9.&nbsp; Pirates of Phantasm

When I joined Rafiq at the helm that evening, he said, �By the sound of it, your get-together with Ivy seemed to have ended up satisfactory to everyone.�

�Did you have your ear to the wall?�

�Of course not.&nbsp; But you can understand my concern when you put yourself in a vulnerable position with Ivy.�

I understood Rafiq&#8217;s concern, but I felt like giving him a hard time.&nbsp; �Well from my point of view, just about everyone on this boat seems to want to get me in a vulnerable position.&nbsp; How do you know I&#8217;m not more comfortable entrusting myself to another woman than to you guys?

�Well...&nbsp; But, aren&#8217;t I careful?�&nbsp; Rafiq seemed taken aback.&nbsp; �And isn&#8217;t it reasonable for me to be a little worried about what you might be getting yourself into with Ivy.�

�Actually I understand your concern.&nbsp; It&#8217;s just that with all this stuff I&#8217;ve had to submit to lately, I always have to worry about what I&#8217;m getting myself into.�

�I didn&#8217;t know that.&nbsp; I thought you were really into it.�

�Do I have a choice?�

�Well, yes.&nbsp; Don&#8217;t you?�

�Actually, yes, of course I do.&nbsp; ...But it&#8217;s more exciting to think that I don&#8217;t.&nbsp; Does that sound crazy?�

�No, it sounds like more fun.&nbsp; ...But what&#8217;s this thing about me raping you this afternoon?�

Laughing as I took his hand, I asked, �Did you overhear everything I said in there?�

�Actually I respect your privacy.&nbsp; But at that point you were all getting pretty noisy, and I was wondering if I was going to have to do something to rescue you.&nbsp; But I stopped paying much attention after things settled down a bit... when it sounded like you weren&#8217;t being pushed beyond your limits.�

�Oh, well...&nbsp; April was looking out for me too.&nbsp; Anyway, I probably deserved the whipping Ivy gave me.�

�Why do you think that?�

�Whatever,� I replied, not wishing to reveal my fantasies.&nbsp; �Anyway, did I say anything else weird in there?&nbsp; I don&#8217;t even remember.�

�I don&#8217;t know.&nbsp; I didn&#8217;t try to hear.&nbsp; ...But there was something about me being an animal.�

Laughing, I said, �Oh, that.�&nbsp; I caressed his cheek.&nbsp; �Such a beast.&nbsp; I&#8217;m in the thrall of a savage master who goes about the world disguised as a cultured and cosmopolitan professional.�

�This may take some readjustment of my self image.&nbsp; But then maybe not.&nbsp; I guess I&#8217;m the one who made the allusion to Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.�

Smiling, I said, �You know you beat me to make sure I satisfy you.�

�You have an enchanting take on reality.�&nbsp; Rafiq gave my a long kiss.&nbsp; His hand slid under my top.

*************

Before the Skipper had retired for the evening, I felt that I needed to talk to him.&nbsp; He was in his berth reading the novel Jane Eire, which I had brought and finished a couple days previous.&nbsp; And with headphones he was listening to a CD.

To me his musical tastes were sophisticated.&nbsp; He was into obscure 20th century composers &#8211; people I had never heard of &#8211; like Hovhaness, Martinu, Hanson, and Rodrigo.&nbsp; After Rafiq started listening to the Skipper&#8217;s CDs, then of course I did too.

Anyway, I approached and waited for him to acknowledge me.&nbsp; When he finally looked up and took off his headphones, I said, �I wanted to talk about certain things that happened this afternoon.�

He was eyeing me sternly.&nbsp; I felt intimidated.&nbsp; But still, it seemed best to proceed.&nbsp; �It&#8217;s about when I interceded to shield Ivy.&nbsp; You were so mad at me.&nbsp; The way you whipped me, it hurt so much I thought I was going to faint.&nbsp; Yet I don&#8217;t feel I was doing wrong.�

�And?�&nbsp; he said coldly.

�Well... I wanted to talk about it.&nbsp; Your anger.�

�What makes you think I was angry?�

�Well, the way you whipped me.&nbsp; It hurt so much.�

�You already said that.�

�Well...&nbsp; Are you saying you weren&#8217;t mad at me?�

�I gave you the whipping you needed.&nbsp; You wanted to match what Ivy was getting.&nbsp; I gave it to you, and then some.&nbsp; So quit your bitching.�

This encounter was not going the way I had wanted.&nbsp; I wondered whether I should just leave.&nbsp; But maybe I could give one more try where I just talked about how I felt, without seeming to accuse him of anything.

�Well... um...&nbsp; I thought I would feel better to talk about it.&nbsp; The switch is so stiff.&nbsp; To have to take it on the breasts... you don&#8217;t know how that feels... so hard and fast.&nbsp; I couldn&#8217;t help feeling that you were mad at me to make it hurt that much.&nbsp; But I didn&#8217;t know.&nbsp; So I came to ask.�

The Skipper&#8217;s expression softened.&nbsp; �Oh.&nbsp; Well.&nbsp; You&#8217;re not the kind of person that I could really get angry at.&nbsp; Anyway, it seemed that you were really asking for it.&nbsp; So I gave it to you.&nbsp; To explore your limits.�

�Well you certainly reached my limits that time.�

�Reached... But I take it, did not exceed.�

�No, that was too much.&nbsp; I almost fainted.�

�But you like high intensity.&nbsp; Wasn&#8217;t it an experience?&nbsp; The pain and pleasure areas of the brain are right next to each other.&nbsp; That&#8217;s why you so easily mix the sensations.�

�Really?�&nbsp; After reflecting on that for several moments, I said, �Well, in a way, maybe I do sort of associate some positives with the strangeness of the experience.&nbsp; But still, that punishment was too much. ...And this whole scene is getting to be too much.&nbsp; Everyone is trying to make me submit to their perversions.&nbsp; Now Ivy&#8217;s acting like I should treat her like a mistress.�

The Skipper smiled and asked, �How does that feel to you?�

�Not right.&nbsp; I feel like all this stuff I&#8217;ve been letting happen means that I&#8217;m going to end up being some kind of subservient slave, and I don&#8217;t really want that.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t know why I&#8217;m submitting to all this stuff.�

�Who&#8217;s looking for a slave?&nbsp; I think of you and Rock being into sado-masochistic sex, not into dominance-submission lifestyle.�

�I&#8217;m not sure I understand the difference.�

�Well, I think of the one as just a sex thing, and the other carrying into other facets of the relationship.&nbsp; I think of Rock as wanting a strong and confident woman, an equal partner.&nbsp; But he certainly enjoys your appreciation of rough sex.�

�I suppose that&#8217;s intended to make me feel really good about myself.&nbsp; That I&#8217;m just a sex object that can take a lot of abuse.&nbsp; Well I don&#8217;t happen to agree with you.&nbsp; Rafiq was attracted to me before any of this punishment stuff started.�

�Ooh.&nbsp; Touchy about it, eh?&nbsp; Now let me guess what set you off.&nbsp; When I said &#8216;strong and confident&#8217;, you can&#8217;t help thinking it means Ivy, right?&nbsp; And when I say &#8216;rough sex&#8217;, then it means you.&nbsp; So you imagine I&#8217;m saying that Rock only likes you for SM sex.�

�Well... yes.&nbsp; Wasn&#8217;t that a reasonable interpretation?�

�That&#8217;s your little self-image problem to work through.&nbsp; But surely you recognize that you show lots of confidence in some spheres.&nbsp; And connect with Rafiq&#8217;s intellect in some ways that Ivy doesn&#8217;t.�

After a moment&#8217;s pause, he continued, �Anyway, what I was saying is that Rock&#8217;s not the kind of guy who&#8217;s interested in a 24/7 slave.&nbsp; He doesn&#8217;t try to control you or Ivy.&nbsp; And he likes to give, and for his partner to receive.&nbsp; But in a sexual context, pain is part of the mix that he likes to give.�

�Maybe.�

�Now for me, on the other hand, having a slave girl has a certain attraction.&nbsp; But I wouldn&#8217;t want all the baggage.&nbsp; I have enough trouble running my own life.&nbsp; Wouldn&#8217;t want responsibility for somebody else&#8217;s.&nbsp; ...Now a slave girl who wanted nothing more from life than to be a sex object, that would be something.�

When I frowned at him, he smiled and said, �Not something you want to aspire to?�

�Only in your imagination.�

�Anyway, you came in here to complain about having your tits whipped.&nbsp; But they really did need a good whipping.�

�That&#8217;s crazy.&nbsp; You hit too hard.&nbsp; If Rafiq hadn&#8217;t stopped you, I don&#8217;t know what would have happened.&nbsp; I might have died.�

�So dramatic.�

�Still, how can I trust you if you hurt me so much that Rafiq has to save me?�

The Skipper pondered that for a moment.&nbsp; �Well, don&#8217;t you feel good that Rock had an opportunity to rescue you?�

�Well, actually yes.&nbsp; But I&#8217;m sure Ivy noticed that Rafiq rescued me, but it was me, not Rafiq who had to rescue her.&nbsp; And that must piss her off.�

The Skipper was amused.&nbsp; Then he asked, �So how do they feel now?�

�What?�

�Your tits.&nbsp; How do your nipples feel after a good switching?�

�They&#8217;re still sore.�

�Then take two aspirin tonight and call on me in the morning.&nbsp; Good night, Jenny.�

�Good night, sir.�

***********

That night I had the strangest dream.&nbsp; I&#8217;m a little reluctant to reveal some of its outre particulars, but for completeness I will set forth all that I remember.

In the dream I was on a boat that was attacked and boarded by pirates.&nbsp; Dissatisfied because there was nothing on board of value, the pirate first mate said, �Let&#8217;s take the girl,� referring to me.&nbsp; The pirate second mate merely sneered his disapproval.

The first mate persisted, �Let&#8217;s see what&#8217;s under her shirt before we decide to pitch her overboard.&nbsp; The captain might want to use her.�

It was not clear who his captain was.&nbsp; But in any case, my life was in jeopardy.&nbsp; It all hinged on whether my body was satisfactory.&nbsp; So I had to lift my top and show myself to them.&nbsp; In the dream my body was weird.&nbsp; In terms of girl flesh, I might have been a bit flatter than in reality, so when I saw that, I worried that I had little value as a woman.&nbsp; But I had these super-puffy nipples that stuck way out like elongated baby-bottle nipples.

The sneering second mate said nothing and merely continued to sneer, but after feeling up my nipples the first mate decided that I was worth keeping.&nbsp; �If the captain doesn&#8217;t want her, then she can service the crew.&nbsp; If they don&#8217;t want her, then we can nail her on as a bowsprit.�

So with my breasts still exposed, I was hoisted over to the pirate ship.&nbsp; Strangely, although I was hoisted by the nipples, it wasn&#8217;t a problem for me because they were just these big rubbery baby bottle nipples with no feeling.

Still, as I was hoisted over to the pirate ship, I felt that I was leaving behind the life I had known.&nbsp; Once aboard, my fear increased when I saw what seemed once to have been a girl, but was now turned into what looked like a synthetic life-sized fuck doll.&nbsp; Only her eyes moved, the only remaining sign that she had once been a real person.

Nearly the entire crew of the pirate ship seemed to be young apprentices, no older than myself.&nbsp; I brought my top down to cover my breasts.&nbsp; But still, the way they gaped at me, it seemed that they had little acquaintance with real live females.

The first mate decided I would be useful for a sex education demonstration for these young guys.&nbsp; �Take off your blouse,� he said.&nbsp; I was so embarrassed to have to do this, but I felt I had no choice.&nbsp; So I lifted off my top, dropped it to the deck, and stood bare breasted before the assembled crowd.

�Clasp your elbows behind your back,� he then commanded.&nbsp; It would seem that this part of the dream reflected the posture the Skipper had ordered me to assume the previous day.&nbsp; Anyway, with my arms behind my back, he led me though the assembled crowd, where the young men then touch-tested my breasts.

It is hard to express the feelings I had.&nbsp; The humiliation of being stripped was more than balanced by a feeling that might be described as sacrificial sexual empowerment.&nbsp; In any case it was an erotic dream, in its weird way.

Anyway, after this the first mate ordered me to take off my shorts.&nbsp; I obeyed.&nbsp; Shorts at my feet I stood before the crowd with just my panties.&nbsp; I was praying that he wouldn&#8217;t strip me completely in front of everyone.

But of course the first mate ordered the panties off next.&nbsp; So down they came.&nbsp; Worse, he made me sit on a bench, my back against the bulkhead, and my feet up and wide apart on the bench, exposing me wide open.

Using a pointer rod, the first mate then proceeded to demonstrate my private parts to the assembled crowd, identifying for them what everything was.&nbsp; Outer and inner labia, clitoris, vagina, and anus.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t have a clear memory of it, but in the dream my clitoris might have been more prominent and penis-like than it should have been.

In any case I always did as I was told.&nbsp; I offered up my body, putting it at the disposal of others.&nbsp; Even now, the memory of how I felt stirs something inside my psyche.

The first mate let them use me like a toy, all of them taking turns frigging me.&nbsp; While some held my arms and legs wide apart, others pinched and prodded.&nbsp; All I could do is squirm.&nbsp; But they didn&#8217;t seem to care how I felt.&nbsp; They seemed to love it that I was responding, but whether it was negative or positive mattered little to them.

The first mate continued a running commentary about my reactions while they took their turns with me.&nbsp; Sometimes I could get a hand free to protect myself, but after a moment they held it back against the bulkhead and once more took advantage of my body.

This aspect of the dream, my legs held apart and guys taking liberties with my private area, went on interminably.&nbsp; I wanted to come off but couldn&#8217;t.

But some time later, or at some different point in my sleep cycle, things had changed.&nbsp; I was still in pirate captivity, but now they had put me to work, trudging in circles to turn this ponderous crank that propelled the boat.

I pushed one crossbar spoke to which I was chained.&nbsp; Pushing the opposite spoke was this Conan-like character, massively powerful.&nbsp; Round and round we trudged, slowly turning the crank.

Much of the crew had gathered around to watch.&nbsp; They threatened me with whips and belts and paddles and canes, but I have no recollection that they actually hit me.&nbsp; Rather they brushed their implements over my body as I passed them, especially harassing my breasts and butt, occasionally feeling with their hands too.

I was curious to watch the Conan-guy working opposite me.&nbsp; But he ignored me.&nbsp; Indeed, he paid little heed to anyone.&nbsp; When the first mate ordered us to speed up, he merely retorted �Fuck you,� sounding like Governor Schwarzenegger in some movie role in his previous career.

But I obeyed and pushed harder.&nbsp; The crank responded readily to my increased effort, although in retrospect, that does not make a whole lot of sense.&nbsp; Anyway, I was pleased that I had that much power over so massive a mechanism.

I don't remember much more about that aspect of the dream.&nbsp; But at a later point I remember the first mate leading me again through the crowd with their groping hands.&nbsp; He said he was taking me to sit in the captain&#8217;s chair and wait until he appeared.

Beyond the crowd at the far end of the deck I came upon a massive wooden chair, ornately carved, throne-like, and obviously the captain&#8217;s.&nbsp; But on the chair was something like a large strap-on dildo.&nbsp; In this weird dream, it seemed that all male organs were strap-ons.

I know that sounds weird, but in the dream it wasn&#8217;t unreasonable.&nbsp; It&#8217;s just the way things were in that alternative reality.&nbsp; But I do recall that within the dream I did feel some surprise at learning that guys could take their organs off and leave them around.

Well, the thing about the captain&#8217;s strap-on being left in his chair is that it was fastened sticking up.&nbsp; If I were to sit in the chair as ordered, it meant that I was to sit myself down onto the captain&#8217;s upthrust strap-on penis and have it enter me.

Of course I didn&#8217;t want to do that.&nbsp; I looked around for somewhere else to sit, but the first mate insisted, �That belongs to the Skipper, and you are to sit upon it.�

When he said �the Skipper� I recognized the identity of the captain, the unseen person behind the entire pirate operation.&nbsp; And I realized that I had no choice other than to mount his penis.&nbsp; Slowly I approached the chair.&nbsp; More slowly I got onto the chair.&nbsp; And even more slowly I lowered myself upon it.

As though thoroughly self-lubricated, so smooth did the shaft enter me.&nbsp; Slipping further and further in.&nbsp; Deep in.&nbsp; All the way.











Chapter 10.&nbsp; Training for Fitness

I woke up fairly early the next morning.&nbsp; I wondered whether I should actually report to the Skipper as he had directed.&nbsp; I knew he intended to try to do his medical officer routine on me.&nbsp; But I thought, why not go out and chat with him, maybe even tease him along even if I had no intention of letting him examine me.

As I lay in bed, I wondered what I should wear.&nbsp; There was no need to wear anything special for the Skipper, but I knew he would be appreciative.&nbsp; I decided to wear a dress for a change &#8211; my short and snug sundress &#8211; and maybe even a bra underneath.&nbsp; Perhaps my mind state was affected by Ivy and April being all dressed up the previous day when they made me strip for a whipping.

So I rose and got dressed.&nbsp; When I used the bathroom, I realized that I was spending extra time on my hair.&nbsp; I even considered using Ivy&#8217;s eye pencil.&nbsp; But I scolded myself for overdoing this idea of an appointment with the Skipper.

Going out on deck, I was greeted by a foggy morning.&nbsp; There was no wind at all.&nbsp; The Skipper was not at the helm, but at the side table, reading.

�Good morning,� he said.&nbsp; �That&#8217;s a cute outfit.�

�Thank you, sir.&nbsp; You... um... asked me to report to you this morning?�

�Yes, I did.&nbsp; You had some medical issues you wanted to see me about.&nbsp; Now what exactly are your symptoms?�

Now I had second thoughts about entangling myself in his medical officer routine.&nbsp; �Um, well... actually maybe it&#8217;s okay now.&nbsp; I guess I don&#8217;t really have any complaints.�

�That&#8217;s not what you were telling me last night.&nbsp; You were indicating some kind of soreness.&nbsp; Where exactly is it?&nbsp; Come on, out with it.�

�Um, well... I did mention it to you last night.&nbsp; But actually, it&#8217;s a lot better today.�

�I know how modest you are.&nbsp; It was something about your breasts being sore, right?�

�Well... yeah.�

�And is this pain dispersed all over, or localized to a particular part of your breasts, like your nipples?�

�Um, well... I guess it&#8217;s mainly in my nipples.&nbsp; I think I told you that last night.�

�Do you always begin your sentences with &#8216;um, well&#8217;?�

�I guess I hadn&#8217;t noticed that.&nbsp; Sorry.&nbsp; ...But actually I told you about my complaints last night, and you told me to take two aspirin and call on you in the morning.&nbsp; But now that I&#8217;m here it seems like you&#8217;re trying to make me feel awkward.�

�Feeling awkward.&nbsp; I guess that is a legitimate medical complaint.&nbsp; We&#8217;ll look into how to remedy that. ...Anyway, yes, I do recall our conversation last night.&nbsp; But I&#8217;m extremely busy, so I was just trying to get you to review the facts.�

�Yes, sir.&nbsp; I can see how busy this weather is keeping you this morning.�&nbsp; My eyes fell on the book he had been reading.&nbsp; �That book... I was wondering where it had disappeared to.�

�Guns, Germs, and Steel.&nbsp; It&#8217;s Rock&#8217;s, not yours.�

�Yeah, but I had started reading it.&nbsp; It&#8217;s really interesting, isn&#8217;t it?&nbsp; But I didn&#8217;t know you read that kind of stuff.�

�What kind of stuff do you think I read?�

I couldn&#8217;t resist this chance to tease him.&nbsp; I said, �It&#8217;s a little different than porno like The Cheerleader&#8217;s Initiation I saw you reading.�&nbsp; Actually it was obvious that he read a range of ordinary fiction, but this was the first I had seen him reading nonfiction.

�Pornographic literature?&nbsp; Well, in recent days I haven&#8217;t been reading pornographic literature.&nbsp; To tell you the truth, Jenny, lately I&#8217;ve been feeling like I&#8217;m living inside a pornographic story.&nbsp; ...This voyage has been like no other.�

�Well, it&#8217;s been a real experience,� I said, mulling conflicting feelings.

�If we get some wind again, we ought to be back in Baltimore tomorrow some time.&nbsp; And good thing too.&nbsp; Out of booze.&nbsp; Just about out of food.&nbsp; But still, I&#8217;m not looking forward to the end.�

Pondering, I said nothing.&nbsp; Certainly I was concerned about what would become of my relationship with Rafiq after this.&nbsp; Yet it would be a relief to get away from this weird sexual environment where I was constantly getting in over my head.&nbsp; A relief not to have to worry about whether I could deal with what&#8217;s coming next.

But I would miss the excitement.&nbsp; I would miss the challenge of plunging beyond the limits of my usual everyday existence.&nbsp; Or would I?&nbsp; My everyday existence is placid and safe.&nbsp; Isn&#8217;t that what I like?

The Skipper broke into my thoughts.&nbsp; �Anyway, you&#8217;re here to discuss your medical issues, right?&nbsp; So let&#8217;s get on with that.&nbsp; You indicated soreness in your nipples.�

�Um...&nbsp; Yes sir.�

�That could have a number of causes.&nbsp; Let&#8217;s&nbsp; have a look at them.�

�Maybe that won&#8217;t be necessary, since I already know the cause, sir.&nbsp; It&#8217;s because you whipped them.�

�I whipped your breasts...&nbsp; Yes, indeed, that is something I did yesterday.&nbsp; And you certainly needed it, didn&#8217;t you?�

�No sir.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t agree.&nbsp; I told you last night you hit too hard.&nbsp; I almost fainted.�

�Well, then let&#8217;s have a look at them.&nbsp; Remove your dress.�

For whatever reason, I didn&#8217;t give him a no-nonsense negative at this point.&nbsp; Instead I gave him a teasing reply.&nbsp; �I can&#8217;t take my dress off.&nbsp; Somebody might see me.�

The Skipper glanced around at the fog. �I don&#8217;t think you have too much to worry about.&nbsp; Besides, I can tell you have a bra on underneath.&nbsp; So what&#8217;s the big deal?�

�The big deal is that you&#8217;re always trying to get my clothes off.&nbsp; And then you do things to my body.�

�But I&#8217;m the chief medical officer.&nbsp; I happen to know that you have some medical complaints.&nbsp; It&#8217;s my duty to examine you to determine the nature of the problem.&nbsp; And it&#8217;s your duty to undergo this examination and have your medical issues remedied.�

He stood up and said, �Now take off your dress, before I lose my patience and decide to take disciplinary action.�

�Well...�&nbsp; I hesitated.&nbsp; But he was more intimidating standing.&nbsp; I didn&#8217;t want to get involved in any corporal punishment again already.&nbsp; And maybe I hadn&#8217;t come out here actually believing that I wasn&#8217;t going to have to take my dress off.&nbsp; After all, I had made a point of putting on a bra.&nbsp; I could humor him by stripping to my underwear, which is not so different from a swimsuit.

I took hold of the bottom of my dress and slowly pulled it upward, enough to reveal my panties.&nbsp; In the spirit of a teasing delay, I asked, �Do I really have to do this.&nbsp; Maybe I can just tell you how I feel, and you can take care of me without having to look at me.�

The Skipper laughed, then said, �You really want a good whipping before you take your clothes off don&#8217;t you?�

�No sir.&nbsp; Actually I&#8217;d rather not be whipped so much.�

�No?&nbsp; Well how often would you like to be whipped?&nbsp; What would you consider optimum?�

Ooh.&nbsp; I really walked into that one.&nbsp; �Well, um...&nbsp;&nbsp; I didn&#8217;t mean to sound like I&#8217;d enjoy whippings if they weren&#8217;t so often.&nbsp; Not as hard as you do it.&nbsp; It&#8217;s you that thinks I need them.�

�And you recognize that I know what&#8217;s good for you.&nbsp; So let&#8217;s proceed.&nbsp; You look very cute holding your dress up like that, but it needs to come off.�

Slowly I lifted it the rest of the way up my body, and pulled it off, turning it inside out over my head.&nbsp; I stood before him in my bra and panties.

�Why are you wearing a bra?&nbsp; You never wear a bra.�

�Well, I haven&#8217;t been during this vacation.&nbsp; But I usually do.�

�Why?�

�Well, in high school, it was required.&nbsp; Not necessarily a bra, but some kind of undergarment.&nbsp; And besides, why shouldn&#8217;t I wear a bra?

�The best thing about a bra is taking it off.&nbsp; So strip to the waist and we&#8217;ll proceed with your examination.�

I hesitated.&nbsp; My mind flashed back to that day early in the voyage when the Skipper had confronted me alone in the galley and made me lift my shirt.&nbsp; That had been so humiliating.&nbsp; But this... This seemed closer to a game.&nbsp; Still, I did not intend to let him get my bra off.&nbsp; I said, �I&#8217;d rather not do that.�

�Why not?&nbsp; It&#8217;s probably that bra that&#8217;s making your breasts sore.&nbsp; I&#8217;m sure they&#8217;d feel much better if they were out and free.�

�You know perfectly well my bra has nothing to do my breasts being sore.�

�Well then, let&#8217;s have a look at them and see what the problem is.�&nbsp; He sat down and motioned me to stand up close, between his knees.&nbsp; With my breasts right at his eye level, and him intent trying to get my bra off, I kept my distance from him.

�When did your nipples start feeling sore?�

�Why are you pretending you don&#8217;t know?&nbsp; It&#8217;s when you whipped me so hard with the switch.&nbsp; ...You know that time Ivy switched me so hard that I fainted?&nbsp; I remember you later said that it wasn&#8217;t right.&nbsp; But then yesterday, you did same thing, and it hurt so much I almost fainted.�

�Yes, yes, yes.&nbsp; You sound like a broken record.&nbsp; Almost fainted.&nbsp; Almost fainted.&nbsp; Over and over.&nbsp; It must have been like a peak experience, right.�

�Well, it was pretty strange...&nbsp; But still, I already said you hit too hard.&nbsp; I can&#8217;t take the switch on the breasts... not on the nipples.&nbsp; You don&#8217;t know how that feels.�

�What would you like to be whipped on the breasts with?�

�Did it ever occur to you that I don&#8217;t want to whipped on the breasts?�

�Then where do you want to be whipped?�

�Who says I want to be whipped?�

�You are a recalcitrant patient.&nbsp; Refusing to do as you&#8217;re told.&nbsp; Evading all my questions with your own questions.�

�I could make a comment about your assuming the role of a doctor.&nbsp; But just to be polite, I won&#8217;t.�

From his seat he gently took my hand and guided me a little closer to his right side.&nbsp; �Stand sideways.&nbsp; That&#8217;s good.�&nbsp; He was smiling at me.

Abruptly he pulled me over his knee.&nbsp; �Eek!�&nbsp; I struggled to get free, but he held me down.&nbsp; His left hand grasped my breast.

�Ow.&nbsp; Don&#8217;t pinch me.�&nbsp; I tried to loosen his hand from my breast.

Smack!&nbsp; He slapped me on the butt.&nbsp; Smack!&nbsp; Smack!&nbsp; I brought my hand back to protect my rear.&nbsp; Letting go of my breast, he grabbed my wrist and twisted my arm behind me.

�Keep still,� he said, as he pulled something out of his medical bag.&nbsp; Looking over my shoulder, I could see that he had that slender wooden paddle.

Whap!&nbsp; �Ooh!�&nbsp; He smacked me on the butt through my panties.&nbsp; Whap!&nbsp; ...Whap!&nbsp; Even through the panties, it really stung.

Feeling that I had done nothing to deserve this, it didn&#8217;t seem right to meekly submit.&nbsp; Wrenching about trying to get free, I slid my right thigh off his knees.

Taking hold of my panties with his right hand, he held on to me.&nbsp; He locked his right ankle in front of mine, effectively trapping my leg.&nbsp; But now I was straddling his right thigh, my crotch pressing into him.&nbsp; Although I continued to wriggle, it was only token resistance.

He pulled my panties up exposing my butt cheeks.&nbsp; Crack!&nbsp; �Ahh!�&nbsp; Right on the bare flesh.&nbsp; Oh-my-god, what a sting.

Crack!&nbsp; �Ahh!�

Crack!&nbsp; �Ahh!�

With a slow even rhythm he laid into my rear with the paddle.&nbsp; And I voiced a throaty gasp with each stroke.&nbsp; My crotch was pressing into his leg.&nbsp; My butt was burning.

Crack!&nbsp; �Ahh!�

Crack!&nbsp; �Ahh!�

I didn&#8217;t want to keep submitting to corporal punishment, but some part of me was hypnotized by it.&nbsp; In rhythm with the strokes I was rubbing my crotch into his thigh.&nbsp; I knew he could tell that I was responding sexually, but I didn&#8217;t care.

But still, after more than two dozen hard strokes my butt was on fire.&nbsp; This spanking was losing its erotic appeal.&nbsp; The pain was starting to freak me out.&nbsp;&nbsp; ...Crack!&nbsp; �Ow-ow.&nbsp; Please stop.&nbsp; You&#8217;re hurting me so much.�

After a few more hard strokes, and my continued pleas, he paused and felt my rear end.&nbsp; �Pretty warm,� he said.&nbsp; �Are you ready to cooperate now?�

�Yes, sir.�&nbsp; As he released my right hand, I felt my burning butt.

�Do you want any more?�

�No sir.&nbsp; That was too much.&nbsp; Ooh...&nbsp; My butt is stinging like crazy.�

�Do you think you can answer my questions now?&nbsp; Without any sass?�

�Yes sir.&nbsp; I&#8217;m sorry sir.&nbsp; I didn&#8217;t realize I wasn&#8217;t answering properly.�

He assisted me to my feet.&nbsp; As he remained seated, I stood facing him, rubbing my butt with my hands.

Slowly, he started to lift my bra off.&nbsp; I offered no resistance, but continued rubbing my rear end.&nbsp; His eyes were glued to my body as he exposed the base of my breasts.&nbsp; He raised my bra above my nipples, then gently putting his hands to me, he murmured, �Mmm.&nbsp; Soft mounds.�

After gently feeling my breasts for several moments, he stood up and pulled upwards on my bra.&nbsp; I raised my arms and he lifted it over my head and off.&nbsp; Examining my bra, he said, �Not much to this thing, is there?&nbsp; No contours or anything.�

�No.&nbsp; Just stretchy material.&nbsp; It&#8217;s pretty comfortable.�

�Just the opposite of a padded bra.&nbsp; Padded bras are like putting your breasts behind armor.�

�I have a couple padded bras.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t think they&#8217;re that bad.&nbsp; They accentuate your qualities.�

�Totally fake.&nbsp; They&#8217;re for foolish women who are hung up about their breast size.�

�You&#8217;re so judgmental.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s any of your business what kind of bra a woman wears.&nbsp; And you&#8217;re the one who seems to be hung up on breast size ...in your own weird way.&nbsp; You&#8217;re always bringing it up.�

�Only to get you to stop being hung up about your breast size.�

�Could we not go there again today?&nbsp; Please.&nbsp; I&#8217;m not trying to be difficult, but you&#8217;re making me out to be dissatisfied with something isn&#8217;t actually a big issue to me.�

The Skipper shrugged and said, �Whatever.�&nbsp; Then he sat back down and pulled me close before him, my breasts right in front of his face.&nbsp; He said, �But tell me, what do you think about puffy nipples?�

�Well...&nbsp; I don&#8217;t know.&nbsp; Why would I think anything about them?�

�Well you&#8217;ve got them, don&#8217;t you?�

�Mine aren&#8217;t as puffy as some women&#8217;s.&nbsp; You said that yourself the other day when you were telling that story about those girls on Cayo Peligro.�

Putting his fingers on my nipples, and running little circles around them, he said, �Yours are puffy, not super puffy.�

�Good thing they&#8217;re not.&nbsp; They&#8217;d just be a better target for your whip.�&nbsp; I tried not to acknowledge the stimulation of his fingers on me, but I may have squirmed a bit.

The Skipper said, �Perhaps so.&nbsp; And you seem to have some reservations about getting your breasts whipped.�

�I hope that&#8217;s finally sinking in.�

Now feeling my breasts all over, he said, �So that gets back to my question about where you&#8217;d rather be whipped.&nbsp; What do you think, on the butt or on the breasts?�

�You already know the answer.&nbsp; On the butt.�

�That&#8217;s assuming the same implement on each?�

�Well, yeah.&nbsp; But it would have to be a whole lot lighter to choose breasts over butt.�

�How about a choice between tits and pussy, same implement?�

�Neither.&nbsp; How about anywhere else instead?�

�Choose one or the other, tits or pussy.�

�Well, I don&#8217;t trust guys whipping me between the legs.�

�So on the tits then.�

�I guess, but still... not the way you do it with the switch.�

�Well, about implements... just now, starting off, you seemed receptive to the paddle, but then it seemed that you developed a problem with it.�

�Receptive?� But as soon as I said that, I could read vexation in his expression.&nbsp; With this conversation it seemed that he was simply trying to ascertain my preferences, and it seemed silly for me to keep getting hung up about acknowledging the sexuality in corporal punishment.

So I said, �Well, yeah, after I got over the immediate shock of being swatted, it was interesting for a while.&nbsp; But then it got to be too much, like hitting one spot over and over.�

�Hmm...&nbsp; Well, of the things you&#8217;ve been punished with, which have you thought were the most effective?�

�What do you mean by &#8216;most effective&#8217;?�

�You can interpret that however you want.&nbsp; Effective.&nbsp; Whatever it means to you.�

Smiling, I pondered that.&nbsp; Thinking of that orgasmic tsunami I experienced when he tied me up in the galley, I said, �Well, that stingy little martinet.&nbsp; What a whipping you gave me with that.�

�That little thing.&nbsp; It has to be used on the tits and pussy to make any impression on a strong girl like you.�&nbsp; He gave my nipples a little pinch.

�That isn&#8217;t true.&nbsp; You used it all over my front.&nbsp; It really stings.&nbsp; ...But what about that short single thong whip you gave James to use on April that first time.&nbsp; I&#8217;ve never seen that one again.�

�That wimpy thing.&nbsp; All show.&nbsp; No go.&nbsp; It would be an insult to your fortitude for me to use that on you.�

�I swear I would never be insulted by being treated gently.&nbsp; Never.�

�Are you denying being receptive to challenging situations?�

�I think I&#8217;ve been accepting a lot of stuff that I really should not accept.�

�Yes, yes.&nbsp; Everybody knows you&#8217;re worried about becoming addicted to punishment.&nbsp; But I think you&#8217;re just responsive to a broad range of stimulation.�&nbsp; All the while his fingers were continuing to run little circles around my stiff nipples.

Smiling. I said, �Could I ask about the medical purpose of what you&#8217;re doing now, stimulating my nipples?&nbsp; It seems overtly sexual.&nbsp; I think you&#8217;re a really perverted doctor to be taking advantage of your patient.�

The Skipper laughed.&nbsp; Then placing his whole hands over my breasts, he started massaging them.&nbsp; Gently kneading them.

I wasn&#8217;t sure how I should respond.&nbsp; As he continued caressing me, I put my hands on his shoulders.&nbsp; I had never touched him in this way.&nbsp; I wasn&#8217;t sure how he would respond.&nbsp; But with a dreamy expression on his face, he just continued caressing my breasts.

Then putting his arm around my back, he pulled me closer.&nbsp; His lips met my nipple.&nbsp; He kissed it and started sucking.

This was highly stimulating.&nbsp; With my arms around his neck, I was hugging him tightly.&nbsp; I wanted more.&nbsp; And yet my mind was unquiet.&nbsp; Did I really want to do this?&nbsp; And right out here in public?&nbsp; What would people think if they saw us?

Rafiq was foremost in my mind.&nbsp; Yet having had the night watch, I knew he wouldn&#8217;t be up before noon.&nbsp; And Ivy had been up late with him, so she wouldn&#8217;t be up for quite a while.&nbsp; April?&nbsp; She might come out, and she can be a blabbermouth, so that was a bit of a concern.&nbsp; James?&nbsp; Who cares about James?

But did I really want my relationship with the Skipper to go here?&nbsp; Therein lay a concern.&nbsp; But still, with only one day left in this voyage, perhaps I was free to do anything I wanted, without concern about future implications.

As we held each other tightly, he continued sucking on my nipple.&nbsp; I was pressing my crotch into him.&nbsp; I savored the warmth of our embrace.

When he unlatched from my breast, I came down straddling his lap.&nbsp; He caressed my breasts as he kissed my neck.&nbsp; My arms rested on his shoulders but I did not turn my face to him.&nbsp; Rather I continued the physically passive role I had always maintained with him.&nbsp; He gave; I received.&nbsp; But what I was receiving now was so different.

My mind alternated between reveling in the pleasure of the moment and wondering how far I would let this go.&nbsp; Would I go down for him?&nbsp; Or would he even try to have me?&nbsp; After all, during our long encounter in the galley, he had implied the negative.

The hot and heavy action continued.&nbsp; But after a time, I heard stirring in the cabin.&nbsp; Then came the footfalls of James coming up the steps.&nbsp; I felt embarrassed straddling the Skipper&#8217;s lap, face to face with him with only my panties on.

As I pulled away from the Skipper and stood up, James said, �Hey.&nbsp; Jenny&#8217;s dressed for action.&nbsp; Gonna join me for morning exercises?�

James was dressed in manner not all that dissimilar to me, just boxer shorts and nothing else.&nbsp; He had a pair of dumbbells and a jump rope.&nbsp; I stood obliquely to him, not wanting him to notice any part of my red-spanked bottom that might be peeking out from under my panties.&nbsp; I fiddled with my hair, having my arms impede his view of my breasts.&nbsp; What an awkward situation.

�I was giving Jenny some massage therapy,� said the Skipper.&nbsp; �She had some complaints about her chest.�

�Here, take these dumbbells,� James said to me.&nbsp; �I&#8217;ll show you how to build up your chest.�

Frowning at James, I folded my arms across my breasts.

�Oops.&nbsp; Sorry.&nbsp; I forgot you don&#8217;t like me saying anything about your body,� said James.&nbsp; �I don&#8217;t know why.&nbsp; You&#8217;re not in bad shape.�

�Well thanks but I don&#8217;t want your dumbbells.&nbsp; I only use Ivy&#8217;s.�

�What&#8217;s the matter with these?� said James, with a smile.

�Duh. ...Maybe they&#8217;re not the right weight.&nbsp; ...And don&#8217;t make any comments.�

�Comments?&nbsp; But what&#8217;s the matter with saying you&#8217;re wiry.�

�Oh.&nbsp; Well that&#8217;s okay.�&nbsp; I smiled with the pleasure of that thought.&nbsp; James rarely complimented anyone.&nbsp; If he said I&#8217;m wiry, then I must be.

�So now you&#8217;re okay with these,� said the Skipper, taking the dumbbells from James and trying to impose them on me.

I backed away, still keeping my arms across my chest.&nbsp; �I don&#8217;t want them.&nbsp; There still too heavy for me to do much with.&nbsp; ...And I want my bra back.�

�We&#8217;ll help you with the exercises when they&#8217;re too heavy.�

�I don&#8217;t want you guys hovering over me when I&#8217;m lifting weights.&nbsp; You&#8217;ll harass me.� 

�Harass you?&nbsp; Us?&nbsp; Never.�

�With your groping hands.�

�That&#8217;s nothing to worry about.&nbsp; Here, just take them,� the Skipper continued pressing them on me.

�I don&#8217;t want them.&nbsp; ...But maybe I&#8217;ll take them if you give me my bra.�

�Sure, I&#8217;ll give you your bra when we&#8217;re done.&nbsp; What am I going to do with it, other than admire it?�

�I mean now.&nbsp; I&#8217;m not comfortable this way.�

�Why not?&nbsp; James is dressed just like you.�

�You guys have used that stupid argument before.&nbsp; But it&#8217;s obvious that guys and girls are not expected to dress the same.&nbsp; ...And besides, I don&#8217;t stare at your body when you take your shirt off.&nbsp; And I don&#8217;t make comments.�

�Comments...� said the Skipper as he turned to James and frowned.

James looked from one to the other of us.&nbsp; Then he said, �Oh.&nbsp; You mean the other day when I said something about a boob job?&nbsp; It was just a dumb joke.&nbsp; But you took it so seriously.&nbsp; Sorry bout that.�

�There, you got his apology� said the Skipper, turning to me.&nbsp; �Now that&#8217;s resolved, right?&nbsp; And you&#8217;re dressed ready for exercise.&nbsp; So let&#8217;s go to it.�

I said nothing for a few moments as I pondered how modest I was compared to Ivy and April.&nbsp; Finally I decided to do what the Skipper wanted.&nbsp; Uncrossing my arms from my chest, I took one of the dumbbells with both hands.&nbsp; But I&#8217;m sure I didn&#8217;t look too happy about it.

�That&#8217;s a girl,� said the Skipper.&nbsp; �Let&#8217;s see, can you curl that thing?�

Holding it with both hands, I was able to do a curl.&nbsp; But on the second one, the Skipper started tweaking one of my biceps, saying, �Mmm.&nbsp; Women have the cutest biceps.�

�Please,� I said, recoiling away from him.&nbsp; �I don&#8217;t want to be poked or touched while I&#8217;m doing this.�

�Only whipped, eh?�

�Not that either.�

�Why not?&nbsp; Don&#8217;t you like it better when it&#8217;s used for encouragement rather than punishment?�

�Let&#8217;s not even consider that.&nbsp; I might drop the weight.�

�Let&#8217;s try another exercise,� said James.&nbsp; What a pleasant surprise that he was steering in a more savory direction.&nbsp; Then he said, �Lift it over your head.�

I didn&#8217;t especially like that idea.&nbsp; But after some hesitation I said, �All right, but I don&#8217;t want anyone to touch me.&nbsp; Could you stand back a little?�

�We gotta be close to spot for you,� said James, smiling.

�Just don&#8217;t touch my body,� I said, raising the heavy thing over my head.

�Now I&#8217;ll help you bring it back behind your head.&nbsp; This is an upper core exercise.�&nbsp; James guided it back behind my head.&nbsp; I let him take a lot of the weight.&nbsp;&nbsp; All the while, the Skipper&#8217;s eyes never left my body.

�Now back up,� he said, guiding it.&nbsp; �Hey, come on.&nbsp; You&#8217;re having me do all the lifting.&nbsp; You get no benefit from that.&nbsp; Let&#8217;s do it again.�

As he guided it back down behind my head, the Skipper went into his bag and pulled out the belt-strap.&nbsp; This time I lifted it myself.

�That&#8217;s better,� said James.&nbsp; �She just needed a little encouragement.�&nbsp; While he guided me through three more repetitions, the Skipper brushed the strap softly across my breasts.

�I can&#8217;t do any more.&nbsp; It&#8217;s too heavy.&nbsp; And don&#8217;t hit me with the strap.&nbsp; That won&#8217;t help.�

�That&#8217;s enough of those,� said James.&nbsp; �Let&#8217;s try the lateral raise.&nbsp; Here, take the other weight, one in each hand.&nbsp; Just hold them at your sides. ...That&#8217;s not too bad, is it?&nbsp; Now raise them straight out to the sides.�

I could move them out maybe forty-five degrees from my body and no further.&nbsp; The skipper glanced the strap a bit more firmly across my breasts.

�Let &#8217;em back down,� said James.&nbsp; �Now up again.&nbsp; This time I&#8217;ll guide you up.�&nbsp; Standing directly behind me, his hands enclosed around mine, he helped me bring them all the way out.

�Another.&nbsp; This time don&#8217;t have me do all the work.&nbsp; Maybe the Skipper will give you some encouragement.�

James hands were still enclosing mine.&nbsp; As I lifted with all my strength, the Skipper slapped me on the breast with the strap.&nbsp; �Ah,� I gasped.&nbsp; But still I gave it my all.

As I brought it back down, James said, �That was better.&nbsp; She seems to need encouragement with the strap.�

Through several more repetitions James held my hands around the weights but gave little help in lifting them.&nbsp; I couldn&#8217;t get them very far up so the Skipper continued slapping my breasts with the strap.&nbsp; Holding the weights at my side, I felt I could do no more.&nbsp; I gasped, �They&#8217;re too heavy.&nbsp; You&#8217;re just taking advantage of me.�

Feeling my breasts, the Skipper replied, �And that turns you on, doesn&#8217;t it.�

�You&#8217;re the one who gets turned on by it, not me.�&nbsp; But I knew he was right.&nbsp; In some perverse way I was stirred by the thought that he was taking advantage of me, lashing me as I struggled, nearly naked, with a task beyond my strength.

�Let&#8217;s try something else,� said James, taking the weights from me.&nbsp; �Dumbbell flyes.&nbsp; Builds up your chest.&nbsp; Gotta lie down on the deck.�

After a bit of hesitation I did as he asked.&nbsp; With so little clothes on I felt uneasy about lying down as two guys were poised over me.

With me lying on the deck with my knees bent, James said, �Arms out to the sides, elbows a little bent.�&nbsp; When I did what he said, he placed the dumbbells in my hands.&nbsp; �The Skipper will help you on that side.&nbsp; I&#8217;ll help you on this side.&nbsp; Now lift, keeping your elbows slightly bent, and bring the weights up to the center.�

The two of them guided the weights up and brought them together up over my chest.&nbsp; I made them do nearly all the lifting.

�And back down.&nbsp; ...Gently.&nbsp; ...That&#8217;s good.&nbsp; Now that you got the idea, how about if you actually put a little effort into it, instead of us doing all the lifting.&nbsp; And Skipper, it&#8217;d be best if you keep both hands on the weight, so I&#8217;ll take the strap to give her encouragement.�

As James took the strap I said, �I don&#8217;t want to be hit on the breasts.&nbsp; And I don&#8217;t want to be hit hard.�

Seemingly almost to himself, James muttered, �It&#8217;s April&#8217;s tits I&#8217;d like to whip.�&nbsp; Then to me he said, �Lift.�&nbsp; Then he swatted me hard across the ribs.

�Ow.�&nbsp; I lifted as hard as I could.&nbsp; The guys helped guide the weights up.&nbsp; Then back down. ...Whap!&nbsp; �Ah.�&nbsp; Across the belly.&nbsp; Again I lifted.&nbsp; And back down again.

Whap!&nbsp; �Ooh!�&nbsp; On the inside of the thigh.&nbsp; �Don&#8217;t hit me there.�&nbsp; But still I lifted as hard as I could, and with their help managed to get them up.&nbsp; When I let them back down again, he swatted me right on the pussy.

�Ow!&nbsp; Fuck.&nbsp; That hurt.&nbsp; I quit.�

�No.&nbsp; You got to do some more.�&nbsp; As the two of held my arms down, James tried to hit me on the pussy again, but knees up and together I twisted my hips away from him.

Whap!&nbsp; Whap!&nbsp; Whap!&nbsp; On the thighs.&nbsp; �Ow.&nbsp; Let me up.�

�We like to get you down,� said James.

I really didn&#8217;t like the sound of that.&nbsp; Turning to the Skipper, I pleaded, �Please...�

The Skipper released my wrist and I turned toward James, threatening to scratch him.&nbsp; He released my other wrist.&nbsp; I sat up covering my breasts with one arm.&nbsp; �I want my clothes back right now, or I&#8217;m going in.�

I had no sooner said that than April came up the steps onto the deck.&nbsp; Smiling, she said, �I could tell you guys were up to something with Jenny.�

James said, �We were working out together.&nbsp; But Jenny&#8217;s not very motivated.&nbsp; She&#8217;d rather be a couch potato.�

I countered, �Liar.&nbsp; I lifted as much as I could.&nbsp; You were just using all this as an excuse to hit me with the strap.�

�Oh man,� said the Skipper.&nbsp; �Not this victim thing again.�

�No matter,� said James.&nbsp; �April will show you how to use these weights.&nbsp; Right, April?�

�I don&#8217;t want those things.&nbsp; But I&#8217;ll take your jump rope,� she said, picking it up.&nbsp; But she did nothing in particular with it.

�Well, how about a jump rope contest?� said James.

�No contests,� I said.&nbsp; �Not after the way that wrestling match went.&nbsp; You guys get carried away and end up turning it into a bummer.�

�She&#8217;s in a real cranky mood today,� said the Skipper.

�I am not.&nbsp; I just know you&#8217;d turn it into an excuse for beating us.�

�Chill,� said James.&nbsp; �Just make some room so April can show you how to jump rope,�

I got up and stepped aside.&nbsp; I felt awkward to be topless when April was clothed.&nbsp; I fiddled with my hair, obstructing the view of my front without making a obvious show of covering myself.

After of couple botched starts, April got going with the jump rope.&nbsp; James was smiling broadly as he watched.&nbsp; Under her tank top, there was plenty of movement.

After a minute, she stopped.&nbsp; �There,� she said.&nbsp; �Somebody else can take a turn,� offering it to me.&nbsp; I didn&#8217;t want it.&nbsp; James took it instead.

He jumped it for a minute or so.&nbsp; �Who&#8217;s next?� he said, holding it out.

The Skipper said, �I&#8217;ll give it a try.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t think this is something you forget how to do.�&nbsp; It took a few tries for him to get the rhythm, but he got it going well for a while.&nbsp; He used the low-impact, one foot in front of the other style.

When he stopped, I knew it was my turn.&nbsp; I wished I had my top on.&nbsp; But it felt lame to keep making a big deal out of asking for it.&nbsp; Feeling awkward and uncertain, I was biting the side of my finger.

Unexpectedly, James said, �April, Jenny would feel more comfortable if you were topless like her.&nbsp; Do you think that would be a nice thing to do for her?�

April gave James a wary look.&nbsp; With gentle sarcasm she said, �Such a sensitive guy to be attuned to how Jenny is feeling.&nbsp; ...But if everyone&#8217;s going to take their shirts off like you and Jenny, then I will too.�&nbsp; She ran her hand across his hairy chest.

The Skipper immediately peeled his tee-shirt off.&nbsp; That done, April lifted off her tank top.&nbsp; But I don&#8217;t think it made me that much more comfortable that her breasts were now out too.

The Skipper then turned to me and said, �Jenny, your posture needs work.&nbsp; Let&#8217;s get those shoulders back.�&nbsp; He pulled back on my shoulders.&nbsp; I dropped my hands to my sides and straightened.&nbsp; It felt better, although I didn&#8217;t like being reproved for awkward behavior.

James said, �While Jenny&#8217;s practicing good posture, April will show her how to jump rope again.&nbsp; How about it, April?�

April gave him a dubious look but took the jump rope again.&nbsp; This would be interesting.&nbsp; Meanwhile the Skipper hands continued prodding my posture, wanting my chest out, stomach in.&nbsp; Then he jiggled my breast.&nbsp; I flicked his hand away, maintaining straight posture.

April began jumping rope.&nbsp; Her bare breasts were really bouncing.&nbsp; I&#8217;ll admit I was mesmerized.&nbsp; She kept at for some time while we all watched, transfixed.&nbsp; With each cycle of jumping the rope, it seemed that her ample breasts did one big bounce and one short bounce before beginning the next cycle of jumping the rope.&nbsp; It was a complex motion.

After a time she stopped.&nbsp; �Awesome,� said James, putting his arm around her.&nbsp; �Totally awesome.�

Smiling she said, �That&#8217;s enough for me.&nbsp; Who wants it now?�&nbsp; Everybody looked at me.

I knew I had to take a turn.&nbsp; I suppressed the feelings of self consciousness.&nbsp; Whether I would look good or look stupid jumping rope topless... well, there was nothing I could do about it either way.&nbsp; I would just jump rope and try not to worry about it.

I took the rope, letting it dangle before me.&nbsp; I looked down at my breasts.&nbsp; There were some red marks on them from the strap.&nbsp; And red marks across my ribs and stomach too.&nbsp; I wondered what April thought about me always getting myself beaten.

I started jumping the rope and promptly tangled it in my feet.&nbsp; With the second try I had no problems, and got it going well.&nbsp; It was fun.&nbsp; Everybody eyes were on me, but that felt okay.&nbsp; I knew I had a big smile on my face.

I increased to top speed, kept that going for a while, then gradually slowed it down.&nbsp; I felt more motion in my breasts at some speeds than at others.&nbsp; After some time, probably longer than any of the others had jumped, I stopped.&nbsp; �There.&nbsp; That was fun.�

�Good tit bounce,� said the Skipper.&nbsp; �Don&#8217;t you feel lucky that your body does cool stuff when you&#8217;re jumping?�&nbsp; He pressed his hand to my breast.

Glancing at April, I was going to shoo his hand away, but she was occupied with James embrace.&nbsp; So I let the Skipper continue to fondle me.&nbsp; Because I felt a little anxious about a public display of affection with the Skipper, I didn&#8217;t know quite how to respond.

After a few moments I moved his hand away and said to him, �Since we&#8217;re done exercising, maybe I should make some breakfast.&nbsp; Just about all we have left is oatmeal.&nbsp; I can make some for everybody.&nbsp; ...Are you going to help?�

�Sure,� said the Skipper.&nbsp; �James, take the helm if anything comes up.�

Interrupting his kiss with April, James replied, �Take your time.&nbsp; April and me won&#8217;t be ready to eat for a while.�&nbsp; Obviously they wanted to be left alone.

So I headed down to the galley.&nbsp; The Skipper was collecting his bag of stuff as I left the deck.&nbsp; I felt wild and daring.&nbsp; Still dressed only in my panties, I had just invited the Skipper to an encounter in the galley.&nbsp; I wasn&#8217;t sure what was going to happen.

Once in the galley, I stood facing the door, waiting.&nbsp; It didn&#8217;t seem necessary to go through the motions of putting some water in a pan for oatmeal.&nbsp; I was sure the Skipper had other expectations.

He entered a few moments later and closed and locked the door.&nbsp; Then he turned and looked me over up and down, eyeing my nakedness.&nbsp; �You don&#8217;t seem to be making much progress in making breakfast,� he said with a smile.

�No...&nbsp; I don&#8217;t.�

�Do you need some encouragement?�

�I don&#8217;t know.�&nbsp; In my mind I was turning over the possibilities of sex with the Skipper.&nbsp; Vanilla sex?&nbsp; Kinky sex?&nbsp; ...And wasn&#8217;t there still the option of no sex?

The Skipper dug into his bag and took out the strap.&nbsp; As I stood facing him, he brushed the strap back and forth across my breasts.&nbsp; I kept my arms at my sides.&nbsp; Vanilla sex with the Skipper was not something I could imagine.&nbsp; It would have to be kinky sex or not at all.&nbsp; Not at all... I still considered that a workable option.

As he grazed the strap over my breasts with increasing percussion, I crossed my forearms over my ribs, pressing my biceps into the sides of my breasts to provide a bit of protection without actually covering myself.&nbsp; After receiving several increasingly vigorous strokes I said, �Actually, there&#8217;s no reason to strap me about making breakfast since nobody is in any hurry for it.�

The Skipper set aside the strap and took hold of my upper arms.&nbsp; �Mmm.&nbsp; Let&#8217;s see how those biceps feel after you&#8217;ve been pumping iron.�

This seemed a better direction for a conversation.&nbsp; Clasping my hands together I flexed my biceps as hard as I could.&nbsp; �I don&#8217;t think they&#8217;re going to be any different than they were before.�

Squeezing my biceps, the Skipper said, �Ah yes.&nbsp; Nice.�

�I don&#8217;t have big muscles.&nbsp; But James said I was wiry.&nbsp; Do you think that&#8217;s true?�

�You liked that, eh?&nbsp; It got James out of the doghouse.&nbsp; But sure, I think you&#8217;re wiry.&nbsp; Here, put your arms straight out to the sides.&nbsp; I need to check out your musculature.�

I did as he said.&nbsp; With him standing directly in front of me, stretching my arms out felt as if I was surrendering my naked upper body to him.&nbsp; I asked, �Are you my personal trainer now?&nbsp; Or are you continuing your medical exam?�

�Personal trainer.&nbsp; Disciplinarian.&nbsp; Medical advisor.&nbsp; All rolled into one.&nbsp; I&#8217;m looking after you.�

Knowing that he would be turned on by the idea, I said, �How can I be sure that you&#8217;re not just taking advantage of my innocence to work your perversions on my body?�

�On your naked body.�&nbsp; First squeezing my forearms, his hands moved inwards, feeling my upper arms.&nbsp; Then into my armpits.&nbsp; I&#8217;m a little bit ticklish there.&nbsp; But I suppressed a giggle and closing my eyes, I surrendered to his touch.

After feeling my armpits for some time, his hands moved down my sides onto my hips, then up my stomach onto my ribs.&nbsp; His fingers slid back and forth along the indentations of my ribs.&nbsp; Then his fingers moved inexorably upwards.&nbsp; Firmly onto my breasts.&nbsp; He pressed my soft flesh in circles round and round.

I said, �I don&#8217;t have muscles there.�

�No.&nbsp; It seems not.&nbsp; All I can find is soft jiggly fat.�

In a breathy murmur I said, �Now you&#8217;re trying to humiliate me for being a female.�

�For being so beautiful, you deserve to be humiliated.�

�Ah,� I sighed, musing.&nbsp; �Is that my fate?&nbsp; To be tormented for something I can&#8217;t help.�

�Such a fate.&nbsp; To have to suffer for your beauty.�

I reflected on the Skipper&#8217;s style, so different from Rafiq&#8217;s.&nbsp; Rafiq was less overt with his compliments and seldom directed them to my appearance.&nbsp; He usually expressed fondness in nonverbal ways.&nbsp; Although quick to respond to an invitation toward kinky sex, in the absence of such invitation, his lovemaking was affectionate and uncomplicated.&nbsp; That I have said little of our vanilla encounters is because I have no issues to revisit; they are fond and private memories.

In comparison, the Skipper was often effusive with praise, as if my physicality was a bright spot in his universe.&nbsp; Earlier in the morning, before James appeared, he had revealed an apparent capacity for vanilla lovemaking.&nbsp; Yet for me, that was too sharp a turn.&nbsp; I seemed to need to maintain him in the role of the disciplinarian.

Continuing the conversation in the vein of suffering, I said, �This morning you set me a task beyond my strength, then you beat me when I couldn&#8217;t do it.&nbsp; You&#8217;re hard on me.�

�Made you lift weights that were too heavy while we whipped you.&nbsp; How unfair is that.�

�So unfair...�&nbsp; I was in reverie.&nbsp; His fingers were pressing into the softness of my breasts.&nbsp; Round and round, yet not touching my nipples.&nbsp; Still I held my arms straight out to the sides.&nbsp; I imagined I was crucified.

After some time, he left my breasts, saying, �Hold your hands out in front of you.�&nbsp; Leaving off my crucifixion fantasy, I held my wrists together straight out before me.&nbsp; Taking a rope, he wound it round and round, binding them together.

�Now we&#8217;ll get your arms out of the way,� he said pulling my arms over my head.

I looked up and saw a large eye-bolt affixed to the low ceiling.&nbsp; �Hey.&nbsp; That wasn&#8217;t there before.�

�Yeah, I&#8217;ve remodeled.&nbsp; Especially for you.�&nbsp; He fed the rope through the eye-bolt, and tugging my arms taut, affixed the rope.&nbsp; �That ought to hold you.�

Grasping the rope with my hands to take the strain off my wrists, I pulled and twisted this way and that, knowing that I could not free myself but savoring my helplessness.&nbsp; �Now you&#8217;ve got me so that you can do anything you want.�

Rummaging through his bag, he took out the nipple clips and put them on the counter.&nbsp; I wondered why it couldn&#8217;t suffice for me just to be bound naked and defenseless.&nbsp; Did we always need to mix pain into it?&nbsp; I watched him take out a little box and open it.&nbsp; Holding it in front of me, he asked, �Know what this is?�

�The little shell of some kind of sea creature.&nbsp; A baby star fish?&nbsp; But it&#8217;s so prickly.�

�Yeah.&nbsp; A young crown-of-thorns starfish.&nbsp; I thought I would use it as a jewel ...for your belly button.�

�I don&#8217;t want that prickly thing in my belly button.&nbsp; And it&#8217;s not going to fit.�

�I might be able to get it in.&nbsp; Or should I roll it around on your nipples?�&nbsp; He pressed it on my left nipple.

�Ooh...�&nbsp; I twisted trying to avoid the jabbing spines.&nbsp; �Not there.�&nbsp; I writhed as he continued tormenting me with it.

�Stiffens up the nipple really good.�&nbsp; He left off the one nipple and put it to the other.

To no avail I tried to twist away from it.&nbsp; �My nipples were stiff to begin with.&nbsp; After all you&#8217;ve been doing to my body, how could they not be.�

�Well, it&#8217;s true that they were stiff as soon as I stripped you back on deck.&nbsp; But now they&#8217;re super stiff.�&nbsp; Leaving off with the little crown-of-thorns starfish, he bumped his fingers back and forth over them, �Stiff nipples must be one of the greatest things in all creation.�

Arms bound overhead, my body was there for him to use or abuse for his pleasure.

�Would you rather have this thing on the nipples, in the belly button, or in your twat?�

�None of them.&nbsp; I&#8217;ve had enough of it.�

�Even I wouldn&#8217;t want to imagine what that would feel like inside your twat,� he said, sliding his fingers inside my panties.

�I&#8217;m glad you have some conception of limits.�

�So what will it be?&nbsp; To the tits, in the belly button, or inside the twat.�

�If you&#8217;re determined to torment me with it, then in the belly button.&nbsp; But don&#8217;t push it in hard.&nbsp; It won&#8217;t fit.�

�Maybe it will,� he said, slipping his hand out of my panties and poking his finger in my belly button.&nbsp; He worked his finger in it for several moments.&nbsp; �Do you ever get belly button lint.�

�Not much.&nbsp; I thought hairy people get belly button lint ...from cotton tee-shirts.&nbsp; Rafiq gets belly button lint.�

�Maybe so,� he replied, now crouching to put the prickly little starfish to my belly button.&nbsp; He began pressing it in.

I tucked my stomach in as far as I could, but of course to no avail.&nbsp; �Ahh...� I gasped.&nbsp; �Please...�

�This thing is so prickly it&#8217;s hard to handle.&nbsp; From one perspective there might be something to be said for sharing the pain.&nbsp; But still it doesn&#8217;t seem right.&nbsp; It&#8217;s more cruel if the pain is yours alone.�&nbsp; He opened a drawer and took out a wooden spoon.&nbsp; With the end of handle he then worked the prickly thing into my belly button.

�Ow...&nbsp; Ooh...&nbsp; Ahh...�&nbsp; I gasped, writhing.&nbsp; Still he continued working it in.

Finally he said, �There.&nbsp; That&#8217;s pretty good.&nbsp; A nice-looking adornment.&nbsp; How does it feel?�

�Terrible.�

�It&#8217;s a tight fit.�&nbsp; He tapped on it with the end of the spoon handle.&nbsp; Then he stood up and looked me over for a long time.&nbsp; �Such a beautiful creature to have to be in pain.�

Then he bent over and began to pull down my panties.&nbsp; I didn&#8217;t resist.&nbsp; In a moment he had them off and was examining them.&nbsp; �A bit moist down there,� he said.

�So?&nbsp; ...Am I supposed to feel humiliated about it?&nbsp; For the last hour you&#8217;ve been goading me sexually.�

�So I have.&nbsp; So of course you&#8217;re moist.&nbsp; As though ready to be penetrated.�

I knew he was verbally feeling out where I was on that question.&nbsp; I preferred to give an oblique reply, �You&#8217;ve got me completely helpless.&nbsp; You could do anything you wanted.�

�And naked.&nbsp; So beautifully naked and helpless.�&nbsp; He put his hands on my sides and slid them up my body, over my ribs, onto my breasts, then back down again.&nbsp; �Such a body.&nbsp; Sleekness defined.�

I closed my eyes and surrendered to his caress.&nbsp; His hands slid down over my hips and onto my butt.&nbsp; He pulled me close against his body.&nbsp; Skin to skin contact, except that his shorts were still on.

His hands then went to my ribs and gripped me tightly.&nbsp; He said, �I want to see if you&#8217;re strong enough to do pull ups.&nbsp; Let&#8217;s see you pull yourself up.�

�I don&#8217;t do pull ups.�

�Well, try now.�

�I know I&#8217;m not going to get very far.�

He took hold of my nipples and pinched.&nbsp; He started pulling them upwards.&nbsp; �Come on.&nbsp; Up you go.�

�Ow.&nbsp; Ow.&nbsp; Please stop.&nbsp; I&#8217;ll try to do a pull up.&nbsp; Just don&#8217;t yank on my tits.�

He eased up on his pull but didn&#8217;t let go of my nipples.&nbsp; I tugged as hard as I could on the overhead rope, pulling myself off the floor.&nbsp; When I could lift no further, he let go of my nipples and clasping my ribs tightly, pressing on the lower part of my breasts, he lifted me further, and I got all the way up.

�You&#8217;re so awesome struggling with all your strength,� he said.&nbsp; �Hold yourself up there.�&nbsp; He let go of me and dropped his shorts.&nbsp; Now he was as naked as me.

I didn&#8217;t try to hold myself up for long.&nbsp; As I let my body drop back down, his stiff penis brushed against me.

�Now another pull-up,� he said, taking hold of my nipples and yanking upwards.

Again I pulled myself off the floor, this time trying to get a little traction with my feet on the wall behind me.&nbsp; That thrust me outward against his body.

Continuing a light pull on my nipples, he also pressed his palms to my breasts and ribs and helped me upwards till, struggling with all my strength, I got all the way up.

The strength in my arms totally spent, I didn&#8217;t want to keep doing this.&nbsp; I knew how this had to end.&nbsp; Yet as I started to let myself down, he did not press his body to mine.&nbsp; He was going to make me come to him.

Again I pressed my feet to the wall behind me, thrusting myself against his body, while struggling with all my strength to keep from coming down too quickly.

He let go of my breasts, and with one hand clasping me under the butt, with his other hand he guided his penis into my moist tunnel as I let myself down on him.

�Oh...� I murmured softly.&nbsp; �Now you&#8217;ve got me.�&nbsp; Hung by the wrists, tormented with an evil prickly thing in my belly button, there I was; he had just nailed me.

He pressed me firmly against the wall.&nbsp; Holding me with both hands under the butt, with a slow rhythm he was thrusting into me.

I had yielded my body to him.&nbsp; After submitting so many hard whippings from him, it seemed destiny I should surrender everything I had to him.

I wrapped my legs around him, helping to squeeze us together.&nbsp; The slow rhythm of our love embrace continued.

Yet I was distracted by the continual pricking of that nasty little crown-of-thorns starfish he had stuck in my belly button.&nbsp; Why did he have to add pain into the sensory mix?&nbsp; Was it because I somehow invited it?

Perhaps I was getting what I had chosen.&nbsp; Having had my rear spanked with a paddle and my front whipped with a strap, now hung by the wrists, I had wanted him to exploit my womanhood ...with some added torment.

I realized that I was reveling in a feeling that I was submitting to what I fancied to be a disciplinary fucking.&nbsp; I knew that was depraved.&nbsp; Yet I was turned by that image.

I imagined that after a series of almost daily whippings, it was clear that I was incorrigible.&nbsp; Not the mousy and diligent person I actually am.&nbsp; But a rebellious and disrespectful ne&#8217;er-do-well.&nbsp; A slacker.&nbsp; The captain could not reform me with a whip.&nbsp; So now he was administering the ultimate female punishment, a disciplinary fucking.

Since his mode of copulation was in no way harsh, the torment of that galling object in my belly button served as the punishment stimulus.&nbsp; Panting with desire, I imagined I was gasping with pain.

My arousal heightened with his steady driving rhythm.&nbsp; My desire was torrid.&nbsp; I could only fling myself further into the flames of passion.

I was propelled by the thought that he was taking everything.&nbsp; Letting fate run its course, I could hold back nothing.&nbsp; Sacrifice it all on the alter of carnality.

Grunting orgasmically, he thrust harder, pinning me to the wall.&nbsp; Forcefully discharging his vitality into me.&nbsp; As we ground our bodies together, it felt as though he was pumping fuel into the glowing furnace at the core of my womanhood.

My arousal flared out of control.&nbsp; I cast myself into the wildfire orgasm sweeping through me as it obliterated everything in its path.&nbsp; In that inferno I was gone, incinerated on the pyre of sexual abandon.&nbsp; Taken ...consumed.











Chapter 11.&nbsp; The Reform School Girl

In the afternoon of the second-to-last day the sky had cleared and the breeze freshened.&nbsp; April, Ivy, and I were together on the bow.&nbsp; All of us were topless.

My back was to the stern where the guys were.&nbsp; But even among women I still feel a bit self conscious about being topless.

April asked me, �How do you like being Skipper&#8217;s girl?�

Put off by that question, I answered, �What&#8217;s that supposed to mean?�

�What do you think it means?&nbsp; He had you, didn&#8217;t he?&nbsp; In the galley this morning.�

�What makes you think that?&nbsp; We were in there making breakfast for you guys.&nbsp; It just took a while.�

�Jenny, you are most unconvincing liar I&#8217;ve ever met.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t know why you even try.�

�Well...&nbsp; Maybe he took me by force.&nbsp; But maybe I don&#8217;t want people to find out,� I said, with a furtive smile at the silliness of my fabrication.&nbsp; �Rafiq might feel obligated to avenge my honor, and that would make trouble.�

�Yeah, right,� said Ivy.&nbsp; �We&#8217;ve heard your rape pretensions before.&nbsp; ...By the way, if you&#8217;re imagining that Rafiq is going to express jealousy, don&#8217;t depend on it.&nbsp; That&#8217;s not part of his repertoire, in my experience.�

�Oh, really?&nbsp; I guess I had wondered about that.�

�It&#8217;s like he doesn&#8217;t feel possessive.&nbsp; He assumes he&#8217;s the most desirable of any of your possibilities.&nbsp; He&#8217;s not threatened if you test the waters.&nbsp; At least that&#8217;s been my experience.&nbsp; And besides, he seems to like to share you with the Skipper.�

�Well, anyway, I don&#8217;t think that makes me Skipper&#8217;s girl.&nbsp; It was a one-time thing.&nbsp; After we get back to Baltimore tomorrow, who says I&#8217;ll ever see him again?&nbsp; I can&#8217;t imagine a context that has fewer implications for future expectations.�

�I can relate to that,� answered April.&nbsp; �I&#8217;m ready for a change.&nbsp; James is okay for a fling, but he has limitations.&nbsp; Good muscles though.�

I glanced at Ivy.&nbsp; She said, �I wouldn&#8217;t mind a change back to the way things were.&nbsp; Even given that there were problems before now.&nbsp; ...But I don&#8217;t know.&nbsp; Maybe I should move on.�

April said, �Leave Rafiq in the lurch.&nbsp; Jenny&#8217;s already dumped him for the Skipper.�

�I have not.�

Well you certainly put the Skipper in a good mood,� replied April.&nbsp; �He&#8217;s like... ebullient.&nbsp; ...And he didn&#8217;t actually force himself on you, did he?�

�No, he didn&#8217;t.�

�But you were tied up.�

�Yeah.&nbsp; He hung me from an eye-bolt in the ceiling.�

�Oh, that.&nbsp; I was working in there when he put it in.&nbsp; He won&#8217;t tell me what it was for.&nbsp; Anyway, was it okay?�

�It was okay.�

�Do you like it better being tied up?&nbsp; Do you think I should try it some time?�

�I don&#8217;t know.&nbsp; I like it okay.&nbsp; But your mind state has to be in a certain place.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t know if it would work for you.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t even know why it works for me.&nbsp; It seems sort of perverted.&nbsp; Afterwards I end up having second thoughts about it.�

�But you have second thoughts about everything.&nbsp; Still, you enjoy it, right?�

�I don&#8217;t have second thoughts about everything.&nbsp; Just some things.�

�Like dessert.&nbsp; Like sex.&nbsp; Like anything you enjoy.�

�That&#8217;s not true.&nbsp; I enjoy sex with Rafiq, like ordinary vanilla sex, and I don&#8217;t have any second thoughts about that.�&nbsp; But with one glance at Ivy&#8217;s expression, I had to equivocate, �Except... well, obviously there are complications...�

�How nice of you to recognize that,� said Ivy, with a tone of sarcasm.&nbsp; �It&#8217;s ordinary loving sex that you should have second thoughts about.&nbsp; But you should accept whippings and hard fuckings as what you deserve.&nbsp; No second thoughts there.�

�Let&#8217;s not start arguing again,� I replied.&nbsp; But something in me was pleased to be able to arouse jealousy in Ivy.

�Maybe we should change the subject,� said April.&nbsp; �I heard the guys talking about putting on like a real show with whips and stuff when we sail into Baltimore and people can see us.&nbsp; I&#8217;m wondering whether I should participate.�

�No way I&#8217;m doing that,� I said.&nbsp; �Not where anybody can see us.�

�I&#8217;m not going to be on the receiving end again,� said Ivy.&nbsp; �And I&#8217;m going right now to make sure that&#8217;s clear to those guys.�&nbsp; Getting up, she went aft.

**********

At dinner, out on deck, the Skipper sat next to me.&nbsp; He was in an expansive mood.&nbsp; At one point the conversation turned to politics.&nbsp; April was complaining about social conservatives&#8217; objections to sex education and their fictionalization of the effectiveness of abstinence-based programs.

At one point, after the discussion turned lighter I mentioned, �I had this really weird dream last night where I was used as a model in sex education.�

�What did you have to do?� asked Rafiq.&nbsp; Although he controlled his tone so as to sound only politely interested, I could tell by the twinkle in his eye that he was turned on by the idea.

�It was a strange dream.&nbsp; I had been captured by pirates.&nbsp; Most of them were like my age, but seemed not very familiar with females.&nbsp; The first mate, who was a little older and more experienced, made me display myself... for like a morphology lesson or something.�

�Did they practice on you?� asked the Skipper.

�No.&nbsp; Yecch.&nbsp; It wasn&#8217;t some kind of gang rape nightmare.&nbsp; It was kind of scarey at times, but mostly not that bad, just strange.�

I was rescued from having to reveal any of the outre details when the Skipper said, �Well, I can tell you a real-life sex education story from my youth.&nbsp; I was going to this private boys school in New England.&nbsp; It was called Uppercrest.&nbsp; There weren&#8217;t any girls there.&nbsp; But there was this reform school for wayward girls nearby.�

�Totally bogus,� said April.&nbsp; �Now this conversation is really heading south.�

Laughing, Rafiq said, �Lighten up, April.&nbsp; This story sounds like it&#8217;s got potential.&nbsp; Keep going, Skipper.&nbsp; And I won&#8217;t give you a hard time about whether it&#8217;s true or not.&nbsp; We&#8217;re with you.�

�Yeah.&nbsp; Let&#8217;s hear it,� said James.&nbsp; 

I kept quiet.&nbsp; Ivy, at the helm, rolled her eyes but said nothing.&nbsp; With a shrug, April said, �Whatever.�

�So anyway...� said the Skipper before pausing and standing up.&nbsp; He walked about the deck thinking.&nbsp; In his place Rafiq sat down next to me.

�It was like this,� continued the Skipper.&nbsp; �Uppercrest had an arrangement with the reform school to sometimes use girls as the subjects for sex education lessons.&nbsp; It might seem a little hard to believe, but at the time we all thought it was pretty cool.

�Of course, no girl would want to volunteer for such a thing, so the reform school would send a girl over as punishment for misbehavior.&nbsp; So one day the teacher starts class saying we&#8217;re going to have some sex education, and a few minutes later the dean comes in with this girl, who was dressed in a plaid skirt and white blouse, which is what they wore at the reform school.&nbsp; The dean was going to conduct the lesson.

�Anyway, to be sent over was a severe punishment, so the girl had to have been considered nearly incorrigible.&nbsp; The dean was wary about what this kind of she-devil might do, so to make her more docile and compliant, the first thing he did was give her a good paddling.

�Of course she didn&#8217;t look like a she-devil.&nbsp; She looked like a regular girl-next-door.&nbsp; I&#8217;m sure she was pretty scared.&nbsp; But she was reasonably plucky about it.

�Anyway, with her wrists cuffed behind her back, he had a couple guys bend her over a table by pulling her arms up behind her.&nbsp; The dean then raised her skirt, pulled her panties down far enough to expose her bottom, and started in with the paddle.

�It was the first time I had ever seen a girl get a bare-bottom spanking.&nbsp; The sound was unforgettable.&nbsp; That strident whack as hard wood hits soft flesh.&nbsp; The girl singing out with pain.�

�Eeyew,� I said.&nbsp; �You&#8217;re like exalting how much it hurt her just because you like the sound of her crying out.�

�But she had a pretty voice.&nbsp; As do you.&nbsp; Have you ever listened to yourself while you&#8217;re getting a good whipping?�

�Not really.&nbsp; Maybe I&#8217;ve been occupied with other sensations.&nbsp; But are you saying that you whip me just so you can hear me yelp with pain?�

�No, I whip you because you need to be whipped.&nbsp; It seems to do you a world of good.&nbsp; Haven&#8217;t you noticed?�

�Maybe I&#8217;d rather not be the topic of conversation.&nbsp; Just go back to your gross story.&nbsp; I know it&#8217;s all made up, but I still object to what you are doing to the girl.�&nbsp; I felt emboldened to confront the Skipper.&nbsp; I felt that having had sexual intercourse with him elevated my status, such that he had to consider what I wanted.

After a moment the Skipper said, �Well, as a hypothetical, what if I were to say that the only reason I whip you is for the pleasure of watching and listening to you expressing pain?&nbsp; What would you say to that.�

Not to be disconcerted, I smiled and said, �Well, I&#8217;d say you&#8217;re depraved.&nbsp; But everybody already knows that.&nbsp; And I&#8217;m sure people think I&#8217;m a little depraved for enabling you.

From the helm Ivy laughed and said, �I think you&#8217;re just depraved period, you slut.&nbsp; The Skipper hasn&#8217;t beaten you enough.�

Rafiq looked at me with concern, apparently wondering how I would react to that.&nbsp; I said to him quietly, �Nothing to get disturbed about.&nbsp; This is stuff we&#8217;ve already been through.�

�Jenny should have been sent to reform school,� continued Ivy.&nbsp; �So let&#8217;s hear this story so we can find out what should have happened to her there.�

The Skipper said, �Well, all the punishments that we could visit on Jenny are a great topic for conversation, but a few days ago she told us she doesn&#8217;t care for that kind of discussion.&nbsp; Anyway, the story I&#8217;m telling you has nothing to do with Jenny.&nbsp; She wasn&#8217;t even born when it happened.�

Ivy replied, �Then it was probably Jenny&#8217;s mom.&nbsp; The need to be whipped must be genetic.�

That really set me off.&nbsp; At the top of my lungs I shrieked, �Shut up, bitch!�

For several moments after my outburst everyone was silent.&nbsp; Then Ivy said quietly, �I didn&#8217;t mean that seriously.�

After another awkward silence the Skipper said, �Anyway, where was I?&nbsp; The poor reform school girl was getting paddled, right?&nbsp; ...While two of the guys were holding her down.�

I wasn&#8217;t really listening as the Skipper continued to describe her disciplining.&nbsp; Ivy&#8217;s insulting reference to my mom made me start thinking about my parents.&nbsp; I could picture them as they would be now in our living room, music of Satie or Debussy at low volume, my mother reading a nineteenth century English or Russian novel, my father reading his Chemical Society news magazine or maybe some Richard Dawkins book.&nbsp; Such a staid existence.&nbsp; Such a contrast to mine.

The sex I was experiencing on this voyage was so far beyond anything that could ever enter their imagination.&nbsp; The torment.&nbsp; The debasement.&nbsp; They would be so mortified if they ever saw the perversions their daughter routinely submitted herself to.

Rafiq must have sensed my unease.&nbsp; He put his arm around me.&nbsp; I tucked his hand under my arm and with my other hand guided it to my breast.&nbsp; His fingers pressed into my softness.&nbsp; What a slut I was.&nbsp; I wallowed in the idea of it.

The girl in the Skippers story... were she a real person, she would have had parents too.&nbsp; Parents who would have been disappointed that she ended up in reform school.&nbsp; Parents who would have been distressed had they known that she had been sent to a neighboring boys school to be bared, spanked, and sexually humiliated.

By normal outward appearances I was a good girl.&nbsp; Someone who seldom gave her parents and teachers cause for concern.&nbsp; Thoughtful, quiet, diligent, academically successful.&nbsp; Someone expected to go places in life.&nbsp; But that was merely the outward appearance.

Inwardly I was a slut.&nbsp; Inwardly I was a reform school girl.&nbsp; A girl who had to be stripped right out in public and disciplined with a whip, always so hard as nearly to faint.&nbsp; A girl so incorrigible she had to be given disciplinary fuckings.

...Except I wasn&#8217;t.&nbsp; I wasn&#8217;t a slut.&nbsp; Since I hardly ever did anything wrong in the first place, I couldn&#8217;t be incorrigible.&nbsp; And whatever I imagined a disciplinary fucking to be, I knew I had never had one &#8211; and certainly didn&#8217;t want one.&nbsp; So why was I submitting to all this masochistic stuff?&nbsp; Couldn&#8217;t I resolve to steer clear of it all and limit myself to vanilla sex?&nbsp; Or maybe it would be best to eschew all sex...

�Am I boring you, Jenny?� asked the Skipper, breaking into my awareness.&nbsp; Wrapped in my own thoughts, I had missed a lot of the Skipper&#8217;s description of the girl&#8217;s spanking.&nbsp; My mind quickly reviewed what I had taken in.&nbsp; They must have pulled her panties all the way off, because I had caught that with legs apart, still bent over the table, she got whipped on the inside of the thighs with a leather belt.&nbsp; If they whipped her pussy, I hadn&#8217;t caught it.

�No.&nbsp; Not at all,� I answered.&nbsp; �Keep going.�

�Are you disappointed that we aren&#8217;t enacting this on you?�

�No.&nbsp; Why would I ever want that?�

Rafiq laughed.&nbsp; I frowned at him, then jabbed him in the ribs with my elbow.&nbsp; He grunted, and then with his arm still all the way around my back and holding my opposite breast, he tweaked my nipple through my top.

�Ow.&nbsp; Quit it,� I said to Rafiq.&nbsp; �If the Skipper wants to tell his story, fine.&nbsp; But don&#8217;t even think about enacting it on me.&nbsp; I&#8217;m not into that kind of stuff any more.&nbsp; And if you don&#8217;t like it, then get your arm out from around me.�&nbsp; But instead of pushing his hand away, I held it tightly against my breast.

Rafiq seemed unfazed by my mixed message.&nbsp; With a confident smile, he pulled me closer.&nbsp; He said, �Just go on with your story, Skipper.&nbsp; And don&#8217;t bug Jenny.&nbsp; Okay?�

The Skipper shrugged.&nbsp; Then he continued with his story. �So anyway, the dean let her up from being bent over the table.&nbsp; She straightened her skirt as best she could with hands still cuffed behind her back.&nbsp; And stood there rubbing her bottom and looking very contrite.&nbsp; Occasionally she would look down longingly at her panties on the floor next to her foot.

�So the next thing he does is to tell her to take off her blouse.&nbsp; She glances around at us, but doesn&#8217;t seem that distressed about his demand.�

�The handcuffs,� said Rafiq.&nbsp; �They have to come off first.�

�Oh, yeah.&nbsp; Forgot about that.&nbsp; After that spanking the dean took off her leather handcuffs.&nbsp; All us guys thought they were pretty cool.&nbsp; Ever since, I&#8217;ve had this thing about leather handcuffs.

�Anyway, having been told to remove her blouse, she slowly opens it.&nbsp; She looks at the dean, then at us.&nbsp; Then she takes it off.&nbsp; She clasps it to her chest until the dean tells her to drop it on the floor.

�Standing there in just her skirt and bra she straightens her posture.&nbsp; She&#8217;s a well built girl.&nbsp; She keeps her eyes on the dean, wondering what&#8217;s going to happen next.

�Next he tells her to take off her bra.&nbsp; She really doesn&#8217;t want to do that.&nbsp; &#8216;Not in front of the boys,&#8217; she begs.&nbsp; But the dean is insistent.&nbsp; And he&#8217;s still holding the belt.&nbsp; He starts swatting her on the legs.&nbsp; On the calves and the lower part of her thighs.&nbsp; After about a dozen increasingly vigorous strokes she breaks, saying, &#8216;Please stop.&nbsp; I&#8217;ll do what you say.&nbsp; Just don&#8217;t whip me anymore.&nbsp; It hurts so much.&#8217;

�So she slowly unfastens her bra from the back.&nbsp; She leaves it hanging on her shoulders, still covering her breasts for several moments.&nbsp; She looks imploring at the teacher.&nbsp; &#8216;Off with it,&#8217; he insists.&nbsp; &#8216;Show your nipples to the boys.&#8217;

�So she slips it off her shoulders and her breasts are displayed to all the world.&nbsp; She holds her bra at her waist as if hoping to be allowed to put it back on as soon as possible.&nbsp; But the dean orders her to drop it to floor.&nbsp; She does so, and stands there very awkwardly putting one arm across herself for partial cover.

�The dean makes her put her hands to her sides and straighten her posture.&nbsp; Then he squeezes and shakes her big funbags to demonstrate how soft they are.&nbsp; Obviously she&#8217;s kind of freaked out that he&#8217;s handling her like that.

�Then he tells her to do some jumping jacks.&nbsp; I guess she figures that would be better than having him harassing her tits.&nbsp; So she starts that up.

�She a well built girl.&nbsp; Maybe not quite as big-titted as April.&nbsp; But certainly not as flat as Jenny...�

�You&#8217;re disgusting,� said April.&nbsp; �I&#8217;m going in if you keep that up.�

Although I said nothing, I also was appalled.&nbsp; I felt betrayed.&nbsp; I allowed him to have sex with me, and in return he speaks of me in disparaging terms in front of everyone.

I looked around at the others.&nbsp; Ivy was frowning at the Skipper.&nbsp; Rafiq and James kept quiet.

�Hell.&nbsp; If I can&#8217;t get a rise out of you,� said the Skipper, �then how do I know you&#8217;re awake?�

�I want an apology,� said April.

�I can&#8217;t do that.&nbsp; I&#8217;m the captain.�

�You&#8217;re an asshole,� replied April.

�I&#8217;m with April,� I said.&nbsp; �I didn&#8217;t like what you said.&nbsp; I thought it was mean.�

�Well maybe it came across badly,� said the Skipper.&nbsp; �The true facts of the matter are that you three are the most beautiful and extraordinary women I can imagine ever sharing a boat with.&nbsp; All in different ways.�

�Fine, but I still didn&#8217;t hear an apology,� said April.

�Don&#8217;t press it,� he replied.

James said, �Come on, April, don&#8217;t make a big deal out of it.&nbsp; The Skipper was just trying to describe an important feature about the girl.�

�Maybe important to you...� said April.

Rafiq said, �Hey, the U.S. ambassador to Italy was once heard to refer to somebody as &#8216;that big-titted woman&#8217;.&nbsp; Maybe it&#8217;s socially acceptable in some circles.�

�Oh-my-god.&nbsp; The three of you.&nbsp; You all need a dope slap.�

�Okay,� said James, closing one eye he cocked his head, inviting her to slap him.

She seemed to ponder it for moment.&nbsp; Then she said, �Don&#8217;t tempt me.�

Apparently sensing that nothing further was going to happen, the Skipper said, �Well, should I continue my story?&nbsp; Where was I before we got sidetracked by the girl&#8217;s well-developed mammaries?�

�It had to do with bouncing boobs,� said James.&nbsp; �She was gonna do jumping jacks.�

�Oh yeah.&nbsp; So anyway... I suppose I don&#8217;t need to go into graphic detail about how her tits bounced.�

�It would be better if April demonstrated it,� said James.

�Fuck you,� said April.

�It wasn&#8217;t a problem this morning.&nbsp; You were really cute jumping rope.�

�That was different.&nbsp; The context wasn&#8217;t sexually perverted.&nbsp; And there were fewer people.&nbsp; And all of us were shirtless.&nbsp; It wasn&#8217;t just me.�

�No problem.�&nbsp; James pealed off his tank top.&nbsp; �There.&nbsp; Is that better?�

Rafiq followed suit.&nbsp; Then he eyed me expectantly.&nbsp; No way I was going to do that now.&nbsp; Meanwhile the Skipper unbuttoned his shirt and took it off.

�Chippendales,� said April, smiling.&nbsp; �How nice.�

�Come on, April,� said the Skipper.&nbsp; �You need to show James the jumping jacks, so I can get on with my story.�

�I never wanted to hear your story to begin with.&nbsp; It&#8217;s just about abusing some poor girl.�

�Don&#8217;t be a party pooper,� said James.&nbsp; �I&#8217;d demonstrate the jumping jacks myself, but it wouldn&#8217;t have the right effect.�

�The story will get better,� said the Skipper.&nbsp; �The girl is just going through some difficult times.&nbsp; Things will work out in the end.&nbsp; ...Somehow or other.�

People looked at April expectantly.&nbsp; I was glad the pressure was on her and not on me.&nbsp; But having made up her mind, she won&#8217;t budge.&nbsp; That she had gone topless numerous times during the voyage seemed irrelevant.&nbsp; I won&#8217;t expect her to respond to this kind of pressure in an atmosphere charged with abusive sex.

But instead it was Ivy that spoke up, �Want me to show you some jumping jacks?�&nbsp; She was eyeing Rafiq.&nbsp; She could see that with arm around my back, his hand was on my breast.

�Yeah,� said Rafiq.&nbsp; �You and me were the ones who missed the action this morning, whatever it was.�

I was tempted to give him another jab in the ribs with my elbow.&nbsp; Instead I just tapped him gently with it, as if to remind him that I was still here.

While April took the helm, Ivy, without taking off her bikini top, proceeded to do some jumping jacks.&nbsp; I watched the guys exchange glances.&nbsp; Then Rafiq said, �Hey.&nbsp; The point was that you&#8217;re supposed to be topless.�

�Oh,� said Ivy with a smile.&nbsp; �Then you&#8217;ll have to remove it.�

With a gentle pat on my shoulder as he withdrew his arm from around me, Rafiq got up and went over to Ivy.&nbsp; ...Damn.&nbsp; But I had to respect the cleverness of her tactical victory.

Facing Rafiq, she raised her hands over her head.&nbsp; He put his hands on her ribs and caressed her.&nbsp; Then slowly, very slowly, he inched her bikini top upwards.&nbsp; Ivy shifted her hips, briefly undulating her body.&nbsp; At that moment I felt that Ivy was a hundred times sexier than I could ever dream of being.

Finally he exposed her nipples.&nbsp; It seemed like he was playing with her breasts for long time.&nbsp; Her nipples were stiff.&nbsp; After a while Ivy took it upon herself to lift her top the rest of the way off.&nbsp; Rafiq seemed to have forgotten his original purpose, having lost himself in her breasts.

The Skipper said, �Well, Ivy, are you going to show us your jumping jacks?�

Rafiq left off her breasts.&nbsp; Ivy handed him her bikini top.&nbsp; Then she started doing her jumping jacks.&nbsp; The guys were mesmerized.&nbsp; But I was feeling disconcerted.&nbsp; And Rafiq&#8217;s behavior was pissing me off.

I wondered if I should take my top off too.&nbsp; Since nobody was paying any attention to me, who would notice one way or the other?&nbsp; But still... the point of this whole thing was that the girl in the story was amply endowed.&nbsp; So taking my top off would just be awkward.&nbsp; I felt alienated and inadequate.

I thought a break from the scene might help.&nbsp; I got up murmuring, �Gonna use the bathroom.�&nbsp; As I headed in, Ivy quit her jumping jacks and with a laugh said, �Show&#8217;s over.�&nbsp; When I glanced back, she had crossed her arms over her chest.

As I was closing the door of the bathroom behind me, I could hear James saying, �April&#8217;s turn now.�

After I took a pee, I decided to check myself out in the mirror to see how much motion my body did when I was jumping.&nbsp; Just exactly what it looked like was not something I had given much thought to since adolescence.&nbsp; A memory... around age 13, standing in front of a mirror fully clothed, with a bra underneath, and running in place to see what it looked like.&nbsp; At that time I had persuaded myself that no one would probably notice the slight bounce.

Now I had the opposite perspective.&nbsp; My concern was that my breasts didn&#8217;t bounce enough.&nbsp; Even when bare.

So I stripped off my bikini top, and in the privacy of the bathroom stood there jumping up and down, checking out what I looked like in the mirror.&nbsp; What I saw wasn&#8217;t that bad.&nbsp; Obviously my breasts can&#8217;t flop around like April&#8217;s since I don&#8217;t have anything like her build.&nbsp; And maybe they don&#8217;t move as much as Ivy&#8217;s.&nbsp; But the bounce is still obvious.

Then I decided to try side-to-side motion.&nbsp; I shook shoulders and upper torso to and fro.&nbsp; It was harder to do.&nbsp; But with the right rhythm it looked pretty good.&nbsp; Like an exotic dancer or something.

But in what context would somebody ever see me doing such a thing?&nbsp; Maybe struggling against my bonds while I was being whipped.&nbsp; That would look striking.&nbsp; ...Except that I&#8217;m never doing that kind of stuff again.&nbsp; ...Well, whatever.

Anyway, I decided that I was making too big a deal about my imagined deficiencies.&nbsp; Only Ivy, when she&#8217;s in a bitchy mood, has to vent her jealousy by calling me flat-chested.&nbsp; Only a fucked-up person would do that.&nbsp; In my totality I&#8217;m probably more a lot more desirable than Ivy.&nbsp; ...But then again, maybe not.

Oh shit.&nbsp; Here I was entangled in this thought pattern again.&nbsp; Comparing myself to others.&nbsp; Imagining I&#8217;m better.&nbsp; Imagining I&#8217;m worse.&nbsp; Does the experience of reality, including the reality of this ever-present body, have to involve a self?&nbsp; Or is the self just an idea that the mind imposes on that experience?

So why don&#8217;t I stop gazing in the mirror and get back to experiencing the reality of these five people I share this boat with.&nbsp; Why don&#8217;t I stop trying to imagine what they think about me.&nbsp; Isn&#8217;t it obvious that most of time they&#8217;re too busy thinking about themselves to think anything about me, good or bad.

I was about to put my bikini top back on.&nbsp; But then I wondered whether maybe I didn&#8217;t need to put it back on.&nbsp; April had probably taken hers off like Ivy.&nbsp; So I might as well leave mine off.&nbsp; It would spare me having to strip it off in front of people &#8211; something that makes me more self-conscious than just having it off in the first place.

On leaving the bathroom, I tossed my top into my room and headed out on deck.&nbsp; Even before climbing the three steps from the cabin to the deck, I could see that Ivy and April had their tops on.&nbsp; I realized that April, still at the helm, had probably never put on the jumping jacks performance I had expected.

I was about to turn around and get my top, but I glimpsed Rafiq&#8217;s eyes light up when he saw me.&nbsp; I also caught Ivy&#8217;s irked expression.&nbsp; I must be doing something right.&nbsp; I proceeded, but with some degree of anxiety.

Trying to be cool about it, I said, �Gee, am I underdressed?�

�No, obviously not,� said the Skipper, himself shirtless like the other two guys.&nbsp; �You fit in just fine.&nbsp; It&#8217;s Ivy and April who are overdressed.�

He ushered me over to the table.&nbsp; I sat next to the bulkhead, and he sat next to me.&nbsp; Ivy was standing next to Rafiq &#8211; as she looked at me, she murmured something to him.&nbsp; Rafiq glanced momentarily at me, then frowned at Ivy.&nbsp; I could tell she was saying something catty.&nbsp; ...No problem.&nbsp; Let her annoy him.&nbsp; I just tried to look innocent.

The Skipper said, �So anyway, as I was saying, the dean was showing us this anatomical diagram of the insides of breasts.&nbsp; Milk glands.&nbsp; Ducts leading to the nipple.&nbsp; All that.&nbsp; And of course the girl is standing there bare breasted in front of us.

�And Jenny, while you were gone, I mentioned that the dean had cuffed her hands behind her back again ...to give him unfettered access to her front after she gave him trouble about squeezing her tits.

�Anyway after all this anatomical stuff, he pointed out that in addition to their mammary function, the nipples were an important erogenous zone.&nbsp; He starts playing with her nipples to show how sensitive they are.&nbsp; And she&#8217;s like squirming with pleasure and her nipples are real stiff.�

Meanwhile, standing behind April while she was at the helm, James was lifting April&#8217;s bikini top and feeling her breasts.&nbsp; After some playful attempts to resist his advances, she gave up and let him remove her top completely.

Then she said, �Ivy, you take the helm again.&nbsp; James is being a pest.�

Smiling broadly, James said, �I&#8217;m still waiting for my dope slap.�

�When you least expect it,� replied April.&nbsp; �That&#8217;s when you&#8217;ll get it.�

So Ivy took the helm.&nbsp; Rafiq stood behind her with his arms around her front.&nbsp; But he cast me a wistful glance.&nbsp; I returned a demure smile.

After James sat down, April sat in his lap.&nbsp; His big hands started kneading her breasts, mushing them this way and that.&nbsp; Then he took hold of her nipples, pulling and twiddling them.

�Yeah,� said the Skipper.&nbsp; �That&#8217;s like what the dean was doing to this girl.&nbsp; And she&#8217;s like squirming and panting and saying, &#8216;My tits.&nbsp; My tits.&nbsp; What are you doing to them?&#8217;

�So anyway, the dean waits until she&#8217;s really horny, and then he takes down her skirt.&nbsp; It drops to the floor at her feet.&nbsp; Her panties... Were they already off?�

�Yeah,� said Rafiq.&nbsp; �When she got paddled.&nbsp; You said something about her looking at them while they were at her feet.�

�Okay.&nbsp; So now she&#8217;s standing up there with no clothes on.&nbsp; And she&#8217;s clean shaven.&nbsp; All the girls at the reform school got their crotch shaved once a week by the local barber.&nbsp; It was for reasons of hygiene.&nbsp; To keep from getting lice and stuff.�

�You&#8217;re totally full of shit,� said April, shaking her head.

�I know it sounds crazy.&nbsp; But that&#8217;s what the reform school warden thought.&nbsp; The strange thing about it was that the local barber was gay, so he didn&#8217;t enjoy the job much.&nbsp; But he had to make a living, so he didn&#8217;t feel he could turn down the work. ...At least that&#8217;s what we heard.�

I pondered the scenario.&nbsp; Which would seem worse?&nbsp; Having your crotch shaved by a male stranger who was leering at your body?&nbsp; Or was averse to your body?&nbsp; ...No question.&nbsp; The gay guy was less threatening.&nbsp; But being shaved by a male was just bad, period.

�So anyway, the dean tells her to bend over, legs wide apart, and hold her ankles, so he can display her privates to us.&nbsp; So she does that.&nbsp; And he spreads her open and identifies everything while he&#8217;s poking around with his pointer...�

�You&#8217;re just gross,� said April.

�This story is no worse than that other one I told.&nbsp; About the hunt.�

�I didn&#8217;t hear that one, fortunately,� said April.&nbsp; �But I heard about it.&nbsp; You&#8217;re the one who ought to get a dope slap.�

�No, don&#8217;t waste it on him,� said James, digging his fingers into her breasts as she sat in his lap.&nbsp; �I&#8217;m the one that wants a dope slap.�

April said nothing, but momentarily lifting her weight off him, thrust back hard into him.&nbsp; James let out a grunt and stopped harassing her breasts.

�So anyway, out come some anatomical diagrams of the pelvic area,� continued the Skipper.&nbsp; �And the dean talks about all the high-powered biological equipment women have that men don&#8217;t have.�&nbsp; It seemed that the Skipper was trying to soften the scenario.

The Skipper paused, thinking.&nbsp; Then he said, �April, you know... you&#8217;re really crimping my story.&nbsp; Anything I say, I feel you&#8217;re going to get down on me.&nbsp; The girl has to go through some difficult times before everything works out.&nbsp; But I&#8217;ll let you choose the ending.�

�Come on, April.&nbsp; Be a sport,� said James.&nbsp; �Let him tell his story.�

�All right.&nbsp; All right.&nbsp; Tell your story and I&#8217;ll be quiet.&nbsp; And I pick the ending.&nbsp; Will it be multiple choice or fill in the blank?�

�Either.&nbsp; Both.&nbsp; Whatever,� said the Skipper.&nbsp; �Just stop bugging me.&nbsp; ...Anyway, where was I?&nbsp; He was teaching us about her pussy, right?&nbsp; So he demonstrates how to frig her clitoris.&nbsp; So she&#8217;s bent over ooh-ing and ahh-ing and generally going crazy, he&#8217;s stimulating her so much.&nbsp; But he just keeps it up.

And meanwhile this kid Melvin, sitting in the front row, is grunting and gasping while he&#8217;s blowing his load.&nbsp; This girl is a hell of a show.

�Finally the dean sticks his big old middle finger up her pussy, and starts frigging her that way.&nbsp; And he&#8217;s really going at it, but it doesn&#8217;t seem like she&#8217;s enjoying it that much.&nbsp; In fact, she says he&#8217;s hurting her.

�A reform school girl, you might think her pussy would be well trafficked.&nbsp; But apparently not.&nbsp; In reform school and all, she doesn&#8217;t have a lot of contact with guys.&nbsp; And girls, they&#8217;re usually pretty gentle with each other.&nbsp; Unless they&#8217;ve got issues... like Ivy with Jenny.�

Ivy and I exchanged glances.&nbsp; It seemed that neither of us liked being mentioned in the context of Skipper&#8217;s story.

�So anyway, he&#8217;s kind of concluded his talk, and now he wants her to walk up and down the aisles so each of us can check her out real good and get the touch and feel of her.&nbsp; So with her wrists still cuffed behind her back, she has to go around to each of us.

�First kid, right off he starts sucking on her tits.&nbsp; Then he has her turn around and he sticks his tongue in her asshole.&nbsp; Some of the guys were really grossed out.

�Second kid, he was such a dweeb, he puts his forehead to her chest and takes hold of her tits and sticks her nipples in his ears.&nbsp; Nobody understands what his fetish is.&nbsp; But the way this is starting off, it&#8217;s clear that anything goes and nobody needs to feel inhibited.

�In fact, this one guy, Wayne Nork... Nork the Dork, he picks his nose and sticks a big booger up her pussy.&nbsp; But maybe that&#8217;s lucky for her, because most guys don&#8217;t want to go in there after that.

�Anyway, this keeps up and she goes down that aisle and each of the guys has fun with her body.&nbsp; Then, when she reaches that back of that aisle, this guy, uh...&nbsp; his name is Mack Swacker, he takes his ruler and starts smacking her tits with it.&nbsp; She twisting and turning, trying to get away, but he&#8217;s got his finger hooked in her pussy.&nbsp; So he&#8217;s got her and he&#8217;s spanking her tits real good, and they&#8217;re really jiggling.�

I pictured myself a few minutes ago in front of the mirror.&nbsp; Jiggling.&nbsp; Imagining myself under duress, struggling.&nbsp; Why do those kind of scenarios always so captivate me?

The Skipper continued, �But the dean mercifully intervenes and moves her along to the next aisle.&nbsp; One guy after another.&nbsp; Each deals with her a little differently.&nbsp; Some are just exploring her physically.&nbsp; Others want to see if they can get her to come off.&nbsp; And others just want to spank her.&nbsp; Her butt, her tits, her pussy.

�This one guy, Dick Brut, he&#8217;s a rough character, a regular juvenile delinquent.&nbsp; Managed to get himself kicked out of school a few months later.&nbsp; Anyway, he takes off his belt and is going to beat her tits.&nbsp; I&#8217;m fearful for the girl.&nbsp; From a run-in I had with him a few months previous I knew what a vile character he was.&nbsp; He&#8217;d want to distinguish himself by being the one to hurt her the most.

�But the dean, who&#8217;s already had plenty of problems with this guy, sees that he&#8217;s aiming to use the metal belt buckle end on her tits.&nbsp; He intervenes.&nbsp; But he decides to use the opportunity to give us some further instruction on the proper technique for whipping girls.

�So he says &#8216;You can&#8217;t whip a girl&#8217;s tits with just anything.&#8217;&nbsp; And he gives her tits several spanks with a flexible plastic ruler.&nbsp; Then he gets out this martinet with slender strands.&nbsp; Like the one Jenny thinks so much of.�

Interrupting, I said, �I don&#8217;t.&nbsp; I&#8217;m not in to that any more.�

�Why not?&nbsp; You know how good whippings are for you.&nbsp; All of a sudden you&#8217;re in a real cranky mood.&nbsp; Was it something Ivy said?�

�It&#8217;s more than that.&nbsp; Just leave me out of your story.�

�But don&#8217;t we need to demonstrate the dean&#8217;s lesson on using the martinet?�

�Skipper...� Rafiq interjected with a shake of his head.&nbsp; He didn&#8217;t have to say more.

The Skipper said, �All right, all right.&nbsp; I won&#8217;t bug Jenny about it.&nbsp; But don&#8217;t we need somebody for demonstrating the martinet lesson?�

With a toothy grin, James subtly pointed at April.&nbsp; Sitting in his lap, she didn&#8217;t need to see him to sense what was going on.&nbsp; She cocked an eyebrow and glanced back at him.

�Well anyway...&nbsp; Um...� the Skipper got up and went over to the storage compartment where he kept his implements.&nbsp; He came back with the martinet.

�So the dean&#8217;s martinet was a lot like this one,� he said, putting it on the table in front of April and James.

Both reached for it and took it up at the same time.&nbsp; James gently tried to extract it from her grip, but she won&#8217;t let go.&nbsp; So he merely draped the strands over her bare breast.

He swished the strands back and forth over her breasts.&nbsp; April continued holding on to the handle of the martinet.&nbsp; It could have been a feather duster, it was all so gentle.&nbsp; ...But for whatever reason, I wanted to see more action.&nbsp; I wanted to see April take some good swats on her breasts.

�Anyway,� continued the Skipper, as he sat back down next to me.&nbsp; �The dean had her stand before the class, wrists still bound behind her back, and he whipped her all over the front with the martinet.&nbsp; She let out a gasp with each stroke, except when he swacked it onto her nipples, and then she&#8217;d let out a yelp.

�Yet as she continued taking her whipping, I began to sense a change.&nbsp; Something in her body language.&nbsp; She was getting into it.&nbsp; She wanted that whipping.

�Still she would let out a gasp or a yelp with each stroke.&nbsp; Still she would wrench this way and that, jiggling her girl flesh.&nbsp; But you could tell she was receptive.&nbsp; She wanted that next stroke.&nbsp; Her body language was like daring him to snap that whip across her tits.�

Meanwhile James was lightly flicking the strands of the martinet onto April&#8217;s breasts.&nbsp; Finally she let go of the handle, giving James free rein with it.&nbsp; But James merely continued dancing the strands lightly over her breasts.

Then he set the martinet down on the table.&nbsp; He started caressing April on her shoulders.&nbsp; That seemed anticlimactic.&nbsp; I wanted to see April challenged with the whip.

Now his hands slid off her shoulders and down her upper arms.&nbsp; As he reached her forearms he started guiding them behind her back.&nbsp; With a faint smile, she bit her lip.&nbsp; She seemed wary.&nbsp; But she let him guide her arms, and there, behind her back, it seemed that she had clasped her forearms.

James then returned one hand to caressing her shoulder.&nbsp; With his other he took up the martinet.&nbsp; He flicked it lightly across her breasts.&nbsp; Then again.&nbsp; And again.&nbsp; They were light strokes, not giving April any problem.

The Skipper continued his story.&nbsp; �So after the dean demonstrated proper tit-whipping technique, he continued sending her around the classroom.&nbsp; I was in the back corner so she won&#8217;t get to me until the end.&nbsp; But finally she got around to my desk.

�The guy before me had already gotten her really hot.&nbsp; It would be so cool if I could make her come off.&nbsp; But I really wanted to whip her too.&nbsp; Wanted to swat her big funbags and listen to her gasp.&nbsp; I wasn&#8217;t consciously thinking about how well both could work together.

�With one hand I started frigging her clit.&nbsp; With the other hand I was whipping the martinet across her breasts.&nbsp; To keep frigging her I had to stay close, so I couldn&#8217;t really whip her as hard as Jenny likes to get it.&nbsp; But I lashed her as hard as I could from the position I was in.

�And her breasts are dancing and jiggling.&nbsp; I&#8217;m really putting the sting to those nipples.&nbsp; And she&#8217;s like gasping and moaning with pain and pleasure.�

Meanwhile, James was increasing the vigor of his strokes.&nbsp; Each stroke shook April&#8217;s breasts.&nbsp; Do mine jiggle like that when smacked with a whip?&nbsp; Seems like they must jiggle some.

James cupped his hand under her breast and held it out there.&nbsp; Then he scored the whip on to it several times.&nbsp; He was not in a position to hit that hard.&nbsp; I knew this was nowhere near the way I get whipped ...and that accorded me some perverse sense of satisfaction.&nbsp; But still I knew that April was immersed in the sensation of it.

As her whipping continued, she brought her hands out from behind her back.&nbsp; With one hand she was pushing against the table to press herself back harder against James.&nbsp; The other hand was under the table.&nbsp; I knew that she had that hand in her crotch.

I was tempted to do the same.&nbsp; Would anybody notice?&nbsp; Across the table April and James wouldn&#8217;t have been able to tell what I was doing, even had they not been totally immersed in themselves.&nbsp; I looked over at Ivy and Rafiq.&nbsp; Her top was off and Rafiq&#8217;s hands were all over her.&nbsp; ...But just fuck it.&nbsp; So it&#8217;s her turn with him.&nbsp; No use of me getting bent out of shape about it.

I slid my hand into my swim suit.&nbsp; Sitting right next to me, would the Skipper notice what I was doing?&nbsp; After his earlier obnoxious comment about my build, I wouldn&#8217;t want to give him the satisfaction of thinking his story was generating that kind of reaction.

The Skipper continued, �So I&#8217;m sitting there frigging her clit and whipping those big tits, and she&#8217;s standing there, just a little bent forward to better offer her tits to me.&nbsp; And those tits are really jiggling.&nbsp; I just love swatting them with the whip.&nbsp; And all the while she just keeps ooh-ing and ah-ing.�

�And a lot of the guys, they can&#8217;t help themselves.&nbsp; They&#8217;ve got their hands in their pants and are pumping away.

�It&#8217;s the sound of her gasping and moaning, all in time with the steady shlack, shlack, shlack of the whip.&nbsp; The sight of all that girl flesh quivering from the impact.&nbsp; All her writhing and undulating.&nbsp; Most of the class had to blow their load.�

Meanwhile James kept scoring April&#8217;s breasts with the whip.&nbsp; And the way she was responding I was sure she would come off soon.&nbsp; I wondered if I&#8217;d be able to.

The Skipper was saying, �The girl can&#8217;t hold in her sexual passion any more.&nbsp; She lets out a squeal as she starts to come off.&nbsp; But I just keep on keeping on.&nbsp; Frigging that clit and whipping those tits.�

At this point April was like alternating between panting and holding her breath.&nbsp; Eyes closed, mouth open.&nbsp; Then she grabbed James whip hand and clutched it to her breast.&nbsp; She was just rocking and moaning with pleasure.

�This girl,� said the Skipper.&nbsp; �Suddenly she just throws herself on me.&nbsp; Pressing her pussy into my thigh and pushing her tits into my body.&nbsp; She&#8217;s crying out &#8216;Ah.&nbsp; Ah.&nbsp; Ah.&#8217;&nbsp; Rubbing her body onto me.

�And with one arm I&#8217;m squeezing her close to me.&nbsp; And the other hand I have buried in that big fat tit.&nbsp; And all this girl... she&#8217;s so right there... I&#8217;m like totally immersed in her femaleness.&nbsp; I cream inside my pants.�

The Skipper paused at this point.&nbsp; Although I had been pleasuring myself, I didn&#8217;t think I&#8217;d be able to come off.&nbsp; It was just too weird and distracting with all these people around.&nbsp; So I withdrew my hand from my inside my swimsuit.

The Skipper continued, �So anyway, the girl gets up off me, and she&#8217;s all embarrassed about coming off while she&#8217;s being whipped in front of everyone.&nbsp; When the dean releases her wrists, she stands there next to my desk, holding her tits that are now all covered with welts.

�Looking at me, she says, &#8216;It&#8217;s because he whipped me so bad, I had to throw myself on him to make him stop.&#8217;&nbsp; She didn&#8217;t want people to think she had been so aroused that she had spontaneously thrown herself on me to come off.

Anyway, the dean leads her to the front of the class and has her get dressed.&nbsp; And he reassures her that it&#8217;s okay to come off when you&#8217;re being disciplined.

�So anyway, that was my experience with sex education at Uppercrest.&nbsp; I was at an impressionable age, so it was inevitable that I&#8217;d be hung up on whipping girls ever since.&nbsp; So it&#8217;s not my fault that I&#8217;m so depraved,� he said smiling.

April was done.&nbsp; It seemed like James had come off too.&nbsp; They were both in motion at the end.&nbsp; Smiling, April said, �It was a perverted story.&nbsp; I didn&#8217;t enjoy it at all.�&nbsp; Then she laughed.

�You&#8217;re welcome to add an epilogue,� said the Skipper.&nbsp; �That was the deal.�

�Well.&nbsp; It didn&#8217;t end too badly.&nbsp; But it was still an abusive situation.&nbsp; If she were a real person, she&#8217;d be emotionally scarred by it.&nbsp; ...After you told me that I&#8217;d pick the ending, I tried to think of some endings you wouldn&#8217;t like.�

�So let&#8217;s hear them.&nbsp; Doesn&#8217;t matter if I like them.�

�Well, how about... she&#8217;s so freaked out by the experience she never wants to see another male again.&nbsp; So she enters a nunnery and is chaste for the rest of her life.�

�Boo.&nbsp; That sucks,� said James.

�All right,� said April.&nbsp; �Then she eventually becomes a dominatrix so she can torment guys.�

�Eh.&nbsp; Whatever,� said the Skipper.&nbsp; �Got anything else?�

�Maybe this one&#8217;s better.&nbsp; None of you guys ever hear anything more about her.&nbsp; And after you leave school you all go your separate ways.&nbsp; But one of the guys gets murdered.&nbsp; The person who did it is never identified.&nbsp; A year later another one dies under mysterious circumstances, and it&#8217;s not clear whether foul play is involved.

�Over many years, one after another of you guys gets killed.&nbsp; Because you&#8217;ve all gone your separate ways, and the deaths occur over so many years, the investigators never notice the one commonality &#8211; all of the dead were in the same place at the same time many years ago.�

�Well what about me?� asked the Skipper.

�It turns out that you are the last surviving class member.&nbsp; The second-to-last was murdered last year.&nbsp; So if I were you, I&#8217;d be afraid... be very afraid.�

�That&#8217;s pretty good,� said the Skipper.&nbsp; �I&#8217;ll have to watch out when we get back.�

�The danger may be closer than that,� replied April.&nbsp; �I&#8217;ve noticed certain strange things that make me wonder if we have a stowaway on board.�

The Skipper laughed and said, �Perhaps we do.&nbsp; But I&#8217;m not worried.&nbsp; The thing is, she wasn&#8217;t mad at me.&nbsp; From the look in her eyes, I knew she had fallen in love with me.&nbsp; But circumstances prevented us from ever finding each other again.�

From the helm Ivy interrupted, �April...&nbsp; Or James.&nbsp; Would you mind taking over your job?&nbsp; I don&#8217;t want this any more.�&nbsp; Rafiq was still caressing her.

�Oh yeah.&nbsp; Thanks for taking it for me,� said April, getting up.&nbsp; While she was putting on her top, James went over and took the helm.

Ivy took Rafiq by the hand and immediately headed below.&nbsp; I knew they were after the privacy of the girls&#8217; compartment.

Still sitting next to me, the Skipper asked, �What did you think of my story?�

Not looking at him, I merely shrugged.

�Are you mad about something?� he asked.

For several moments I didn&#8217;t reply.&nbsp; Finally, still not looking at him, I said, �Yes.&nbsp; But I&#8217;m not going to talk about it out here.&nbsp; Let me out.&nbsp; I&#8217;m going below.�

He got up and I slid out from the table.&nbsp; As I went down the steps, I glanced back at him.&nbsp; He wasn&#8217;t coming.&nbsp; I stopped and just looked at him.&nbsp; Did he understand that I wanted to talk to him but was too annoyed to ask?&nbsp; I turned and entered the cabin.

I went into the guys compartment.&nbsp; The Skipper followed me in.&nbsp; I was still topless.&nbsp; I couldn&#8217;t confront him that way.&nbsp; He would just look at my breasts the whole time and make me really self conscious.&nbsp; I picked up a towel and draped it around my shoulders, covering myself.

Then I said, �Why did you feel you had to insult me out there?�

The Skipper looked confused.&nbsp; �Did I insult you?&nbsp; What did I say?�

�You called me flat chested.&nbsp; After I have sex with you, that&#8217;s the way you treat me.&nbsp; And it&#8217;s not even true.&nbsp; I know girls with lesser builds than me, and they&#8217;re very cute girls.�

�Well of course they are.&nbsp; Flat chested isn&#8217;t an insult.&nbsp; It&#8217;s just as much of a compliment as &#8216;stacked&#8217; or whatever.&nbsp; I love the diversity of women&#8217;s builds.&nbsp; ...And, well, it&#8217;s true that I did exaggerate.&nbsp; But only to make you more special.&nbsp; You&#8217;re actually not that flat.&nbsp; You&#8217;re a regular A size.�

�My bra size is none of your business.�

�You&#8217;re the one who wanted to talk.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t care to be snapped at.�

�All right...�&nbsp; Then after a pause I said, �Well, coming from you maybe it&#8217;s not that big a deal.&nbsp; It&#8217;s just that calling me &#8216;flat-chested&#8217; is one of the ways that Ivy tries to annoy me when she&#8217;s feeling bitchy.&nbsp; Like &#8216;flat-chested slut girl&#8217;.�

�Ivy says that to you?&nbsp; How crude.�&nbsp; Then he laughed and said, �She&#8217;s figured out how to yank your chain.&nbsp; Fact is, she isn&#8217;t that different from you.&nbsp; She&#8217;s a B-size.&nbsp; Were there any doubt just by looking at her, I noticed it in her laundry heap.�&nbsp; There was furtive smile on his face.

�You go through girls&#8217; laundry to check out their bras?&nbsp; You are a pervert.�

The Skipper laughed and said, �I like bras.&nbsp; It&#8217;s because they&#8217;ve had breasts inside them.&nbsp; Speaking of which, there is no need to cover yours with that towel.�

I said, �I didn&#8217;t feel I could confront you if I weren&#8217;t clothed.�

�But now you feel better that the misunderstanding is cleared up.�

I slid the towel off my shoulders and tossed it on the back of the chair where it came from.&nbsp; Wanting to move the conversation away from me and my body, I said, �I can&#8217;t figure out whether you make up your stories on the fly or whether you have previously worked them out.�

�Well, I have these underlying scenarios.&nbsp; But the details come out as I&#8217;m telling the story.�

�You&#8217;re good at it.&nbsp; Me, I&#8217;m not a storyteller.&nbsp; I&#8217;m not comfortable being the center of conversation for long enough.�

�Too shy, but that&#8217;s part of your charm.&nbsp; Of course it&#8217;s harder to tell a story if you&#8217;re not sure people want to hear it.&nbsp; Today April was giving me such a hard time.&nbsp; I wasn&#8217;t sure what I was allowed to say.&nbsp; Like I held back from adding this bit about making the girl lay her tits down on a table full of thumb tacks.�

�Eeyew...�

�Of course I&#8217;m not going to pretend any of that stuff actually happened.&nbsp; Except Rafiq is not allowed to question it.�

�Or you take it out on me?�

�Exactly.&nbsp; If he makes trouble, you get a whipping.�

�Except that I&#8217;m not in to that any more.&nbsp; I&#8217;m turning over a new leaf,� I said, as I sat down on his bed and kicked off my sandals.

I could tell by the way he was eyeing me that he was gaging the significance of me sitting on his bed.&nbsp; He said, �Turning over a new leaf?&nbsp; Why?�

�Maybe just to try out being normal again.�

Sitting down next to me, he replied, �After experiencing the extraordinary, how can you ever be satisfied with the ordinary.�

�Try me.�&nbsp; As I said that I lay down and stretched out, bringing my hands up to rest my head on.&nbsp; I wondered if this was too blatant an invitation.

The Skipper eyed my exposed front for several moments.&nbsp; But then he only touched my hair, and then my cheek.&nbsp; Slow and patient.&nbsp; I like that.

Only then did he take up the offer of my exposed front.&nbsp; Placing his hand on my ribs, he stroked down my stomach.

I nestled contentedly, arching my back.&nbsp; His hand slid back up and caressed my breasts.&nbsp; His fingers rode in circles around my nipples.&nbsp; My body was electric.&nbsp; Surging with erotic energy.

His hands slid down my torso, gripped my swimsuit bottom, and pulled downward.&nbsp; I raised my butt off the mattress to assist.&nbsp; Having stripped me naked, the Skipper kicked off his shoes and took down his shorts.&nbsp; There was no underwear beneath.&nbsp; He lay down next to me.

He stroked my breasts, then twiddled my nipples.&nbsp; His thigh across my crotch, I pressed into him.&nbsp; The heat of sexual passion rose as we continued.&nbsp; On and on.&nbsp; ...Finally, he rolled on top of me and our bodies joined as one.

Moving in rhythm.&nbsp; Together locked in the pursuit of sensual pleasure.&nbsp; Further and further we went.

Here was what should have been a purely vanilla encounter.&nbsp; Yet I couldn&#8217;t just let it remain like that.&nbsp; I seemed to need something else.&nbsp; At some point I stopped hugging him and brought my arms over my head.&nbsp; I gripped the edge of the mattress above my head with both hands.&nbsp; In my mind my arms were restrained.&nbsp; A captive being ravished by the captain of this vessel.

The effect on his energy was pronounced.&nbsp; Thrusting forcefully into me, he brought one hand up to hold my wrists down, while his other hand held me firmly under the butt.&nbsp; It was obvious that I was not the only one gripped by the image of him taking me by force.

A force it was, carrying me over the top.&nbsp; With a convulsive shiver, my body and mind were seized by climactic tremor.&nbsp; From the grip of sexual passion, the release to orgasmic ecstacy.

Me gasping loudly.&nbsp; Him grunting bullishly.&nbsp; Together we rode the torrent of energy to the ending of time...&nbsp; All the way to the ending of endless time.

...And then back again.&nbsp; Back again... wanting nothing... satisfied with everything.












Chapter 12: Crux Simplex

It was early afternoon and for some time we had been sailing up Chesapeake Bay, expecting to arrive back in the marina at Baltimore Harbor late in the afternoon.&nbsp; April, Ivy, and I were chatting.&nbsp; All of us were ready for the change of scene.

�Shopping deprivation,� said Ivy.&nbsp; �I&#8217;m suffering from shopping deprivation.&nbsp; Tomorrow I&#8217;m spending no less than six hours at the mall.�

That comment triggered a discussion of our various clothes shopping habits.&nbsp; Ivy had more expensive tendencies than I did, but we both liked stores with a great variety of items but few replicates.&nbsp; Then it was more likely that you could find things that you didn&#8217;t see other people wearing.&nbsp; April was less concerned about that.&nbsp; But all three of us liked big markdowns.

Rafiq appeared from below, approached us, but then moved on when he caught the gist of our conversation.&nbsp; He joined the Skipper and James around the helm.&nbsp; They talked quietly.
After a while Rafiq and the Skipper approached us.&nbsp; Rafiq said, �We have a proposal.&nbsp; It seems that no one has been tied up for a while.�

�For a while?� said April.&nbsp; �Like a whole day?�

�It&#8217;s been longer than that, hasn&#8217;t it?� answered Rafiq.

�I don&#8217;t think so,� said April.&nbsp; �Jenny had the Skipper tie her up when they had sex in the galley yesterday morning...�

�Hey!� I interrupted.&nbsp; �Can&#8217;t you mind your own business?�&nbsp; I could hardly believe she would tell Rafiq about that.

Yet there was no sign that Rafiq was disturbed by the revelation.&nbsp; He merely said, �Well that was yesterday.&nbsp; What about today?�

�You wouldn&#8217;t want to miss your daily regimen, would you?� said the Skipper.

�And this might be your last chance for a long time,� added Rafiq.

Ivy spoke up, �If I participate, it will be as top, not bottom.&nbsp; You agreed that we ought to switch places sometime.�

�Did I say that?� said Rafiq.&nbsp; �It must have been just a passing thought.&nbsp; ...But sure, I&#8217;ll try anything, if that&#8217;s what you want to do.�

The image of Rafiq in a submissive role was not appealing to me.&nbsp; But I could relate to the image of him being tied up and whipped like a sailor of previous centuries.&nbsp; I was sure he would take it bravely.

�Jenny,� said the Skipper.&nbsp; �I was thinking you could be tied to the mast.&nbsp; That would be new.�

Looking around, the shore on either side of the bay was distant, but there were a fair number of boats on the water.&nbsp; �I can&#8217;t do that.&nbsp; Somebody might see me.�

�Who would notice?&nbsp; Nobody&#8217;s that close.�

�Not at the moment.&nbsp; But they could get close.�

�So what?&nbsp; They wouldn&#8217;t think anything of it.&nbsp; Just some maritime discipline.�

�Maritime discipline?&nbsp; Is that your new word for what goes on here.&nbsp; Normal people would be shocked if they ever saw all this stuff.�

�Hell no.&nbsp; They could tell right away that you need to be disciplined.�

�Why?&nbsp; I haven&#8217;t done anything wrong.�

�Hell you haven&#8217;t.&nbsp; You&#8217;re sassing the captain.�

�Fuck you,� I said, laughing.&nbsp; Then I made an ugly face and stuck out my tongue.

The Skipper looked at Rafiq and said, �You can tell she wants the whip.�

�I&#8217;m not doing anything where anybody out there can see me.�

Looking at me, James took off his baseball cap.&nbsp; Then he flipped it over to me, saying, �Here, wear this with the bill kinda low over your face.&nbsp; Then no one can see who you are.�

Making no attempt to catch the cap, I let it fall to the deck.&nbsp; But April picked it up, and taking her hair out of her pony tail and letting it fall around her face, put it on, low over her face.

�Looks cute,� said Ivy.

�Here, take the helm, Rock,� said James.&nbsp; �I&#8217;m gonna be tying April to the mast.�

Readjusting her hair back, April looked at Ivy and me.&nbsp; �Should I do it?�

I wasn&#8217;t sure what to say.&nbsp; I knew I was wrapped up in what I thought was best for me.&nbsp; If April got tied up, would that take the pressure off me?&nbsp; Or put more pressure on me?&nbsp; Was I intent on not getting myself tied up?&nbsp; Or did I actually want to do it with April?

With her eyes on me, April said, �All right.&nbsp; I&#8217;ll do it.&nbsp; I can tell that Jenny wants to do it too.�

�I never said that.�

�I can always tell what you&#8217;re thinking just by looking at you.�

�I&#8217;m still not sure.&nbsp; Maybe I will.&nbsp; Or maybe not.&nbsp; If you want to do it, go ahead.�

With Rafiq now at the helm, April and James and I went forward to the mast, with some rope.&nbsp; The Skipper went below to gather his disciplinary devices.

Ivy stayed behind with Rafiq.&nbsp; That caused me some anxiety.&nbsp; I wondered if I should stay with Rafiq too.&nbsp; But no, if I were clingy, that would just diminish me in Rafiq&#8217;s eyes.&nbsp; I had to be independent, confident.&nbsp; Be willing to create distance to let him come to me.&nbsp; It was not a stretch to believe that Rafiq preferred me.

With April, James, and me gathered at the mast, James said, �Okay April, you can start by taking off your top.�

�I can&#8217;t take off my top here.&nbsp; Somebody might see me.�

With a look of surprise, he said, �Are you trying to sound like Jenny?�

�Just because I&#8217;ve taken off my top out in the middle of the ocean doesn&#8217;t mean I go around like that in regular life.&nbsp; Look at all the boats around here.�

James replied, �What&#8217;s the point of getting tied to mast with your clothes on?�

�A bikini is scanty-enough attire,� she answered.&nbsp; But from the smile on her face it seemed that she was putting on a bit of an act about being distressed about taking her top off.

The Skipper now joined us.&nbsp; He had brought the martinet, the belt-strap, and the cane.&nbsp; But my jaw dropped when I saw that he had fastened the dildo to the six-foot-long boat hook pole.&nbsp; Eeyew...&nbsp; To me there&#8217;s something really gross about the idea of being fucked with a long pole.

�Well,� said the Skipper.&nbsp; �If April doesn&#8217;t want to take off her top, maybe Jenny can strip her of it.�

�How am I going to do that if she doesn&#8217;t let me?�

�Your orders are now to strip her top off her.&nbsp; Do you want a whipping for disobedience?�&nbsp; The Skipper was holding the strap.

I didn&#8217;t much like the way he was ordering me about and making threats.&nbsp; Yet I also didn&#8217;t like the idea of the guys descending on April and tearing her clothes off.&nbsp; It seemed better if I did it, if April would let me.

�Come here,� said the Skipper, taking my hand.&nbsp; He was eyeing my body.&nbsp; All I had on was my bikini swimsuit.&nbsp; He swung the strap onto the back of my thighs.&nbsp; Whap.&nbsp; Whap.&nbsp; Whap.

�Ow...�&nbsp; I wrenched away from him.&nbsp; Being light strokes, my distress had less to do with actual pain than with the idea that I was letting myself get whipped again.&nbsp; Out of reach of the strap, I rubbed the backs of my thighs as I eyed the Skipper.&nbsp; With a smile, he watched me.&nbsp; I could tell that he was expecting me to be receptive.

But I wasn&#8217;t going to be that compliant, even if this was my last fling with his maritime discipline.&nbsp; I said, �You had no right to do that.�

�Just obey your orders,� he replied.

I looked a April.&nbsp; She was smiling at me.&nbsp; James was smiling too, probably hoping for a cat fight.&nbsp; ...All right.&nbsp; I would see if I could get April&#8217;s top off.

Approaching her, I said, �Let&#8217;s not make this like that stupid wrestling match.&nbsp; That didn&#8217;t work out well.�

�Because I always won?&nbsp; I had no objection to that.�

�Quit being a shit head.&nbsp; You know the problem was these dumb guys getting carried away with swatting us.�&nbsp; Then reaching around behind her to undo her bikini top, I said, �If you don&#8217;t cooperate, they&#8217;re going to whip me again.�

But before I could undo her top, she grabbed mine and pulling up, exposed my breasts.&nbsp; I pulled away from her and tugged my top back down.&nbsp; �Bitch,� I said, laughing, �you weren&#8217;t supposed to do that.�&nbsp; Then looking at the guys, I said, �I can&#8217;t do it.&nbsp; She won&#8217;t cooperate.&nbsp; James, you should do it.�

As James stepped forward, the Skipper said, �No.&nbsp; Jenny has been ordered to strip April.&nbsp; If she doesn&#8217;t obey, she&#8217;s going to have to be disciplined.�

�I haven&#8217;t refused.&nbsp; I tried but I couldn&#8217;t do it.�

�Bullshit.�&nbsp; Whap!&nbsp; The Skipper swatted the strap hard across my thighs.&nbsp; Whap!&nbsp; Whap!&nbsp; Whap!

�Ow, ow.&nbsp; Please no.�&nbsp; As I tried to ward off the strokes to my thighs, he hit me on the side of the ribs, then across the back as I turned away from him.&nbsp; �Ow.&nbsp; I&#8217;ll do what you want.&nbsp; Just stop swatting me with that thing.�

When he let up, I stood feeling the strap marks on my body.&nbsp; Then I turned to April.&nbsp; �Are you going to let me do this?�

�I wasn&#8217;t stopping you.�

�Well, if I want to keep my clothes on, then in effect you were.&nbsp; But it&#8217;s no use arguing with you when you get like that.�&nbsp; Then approaching her again, I said, �All right.&nbsp; I&#8217;m going to do it this time.�

Thrusting myself on her, I threw my arms around her in a tight embrace.&nbsp; As I untied the back of her top, she was tugging upwards on mine.&nbsp; With one hand I tried to hold it down.&nbsp; But as I reached my other hand up to get the tie from behind her neck and up over her head, she pulled my top partly off.&nbsp; It was no use resisting.&nbsp; And with her top off, it was only fair that mine should go too.

Putting up token resistance, I raised my arms just enough to let her slip it off me.&nbsp; Now both of us were bare breasted.&nbsp; Laughing and hugging her, I grasped her big boobs, mushing them this way and that.&nbsp; She responded in kind with my breasts.

�Are you going to get tied up with me,� she asked.

�Maybe I should help tie you up.&nbsp; Why should I always be on the receiving end?�

�Wimp.�

�Okay, April,� said the Skipper.&nbsp; �Stand with your back against the mast.&nbsp; Jenny can tie you up.�

�Jenny&#8217;s not going to do it right,� said James.&nbsp; �Gimme that rope.�

As April and I separated, I didn&#8217;t dispute James.&nbsp; This is the kind of situation where no matter how we women do it, the guys will find fault.&nbsp; I stepped out of the way.

After April adjusted the baseball cap low over her face, James starting binding her wrists back behind the mast.&nbsp; Then he changed his mind, and decided he wanted her to clasp her elbows behind her back.&nbsp; Having bound her arms behind her, he then roped her to the mast, circling several times above the breasts, several times below the breasts, and several times at her hips.

I stood watching with one arm covering my breasts.&nbsp; I knew it would be better for my state of mind if I paid no attention to Ivy and Rafiq, but I couldn&#8217;t resist glancing back at them.&nbsp;&nbsp; There was Rafiq at the helm.&nbsp; Ivy was lifting off his tank top.&nbsp; I turned my attention back to April, now bound to the mast.&nbsp; James was caressing her body.

Meanwhile the Skipper was looking into the plastic grocery bag where he keeps his smaller implements.&nbsp; He pulled out a roll of thin twine.&nbsp; �Maybe tie up April&#8217;s tits,� he said.

As James reached for the twine, the Skipper said, �How about letting Jenny do it.&nbsp; If you&#8217;re not satisfied then you can redo it.�

Taking the twine, I asked, �How do you want me to do it?�

�Do her nipples.&nbsp; Get the nub of the nipple.�

I looked at April.&nbsp; She was not perturbed.&nbsp; As James held her right breast, I put the twine around the nub of her nipple and tightened slowly.&nbsp; �Tell me when it&#8217;s tight enough,� I said to her.

Breathing shallowly, she watched me tighten it.&nbsp; She bit her lip.&nbsp; I tightened some more.&nbsp; �No more,� she gasped.&nbsp; But instead of stopping, I tightened a little more before leaving off.&nbsp; �Oooh...� she said with a grimace.

�Now tie her nipples tight together,� said James.&nbsp; He pressed her breasts together, nipples touching.

I secured the twine to the other nipple and slowly tightened.&nbsp; And again I tightened beyond where she wanted me to stop.&nbsp; I was feeling devilish.&nbsp; Now I was the person in control.

When I finished the job, I stepped back to admire.&nbsp; It was like April&#8217;s big breasts were looking at each other cross-eyed.&nbsp; James started flopping them.

With a combination of a smile and grimace, April cussed both of us, �Fuckers.&nbsp; When I get out of this, I&#8217;m going to kick both of you in the ass.�

�Then we better not let you go till we tame you,� said James.&nbsp; �The whip.&nbsp; That&#8217;s what you need now.�

The Skipper said, �Let&#8217;s give Jenny a turn.&nbsp; She almost never gets to whip anybody.�

�Good idea,� said James.&nbsp; �See if she can tame her.�

The Skipper handed me the martinet.&nbsp; �See what you can do with it.�

Taking up the martinet, I said to April, �I don&#8217;t have any choice; I&#8217;ve been ordered to whip you.&nbsp; So don&#8217;t blame me for it.�

�I won&#8217;t get mad.&nbsp; I&#8217;ll just get even.&nbsp; And you&#8217;re savoring that.�

I don&#8217;t know that I was savoring a turnabout, put I didn&#8217;t have a problem with April punishing me in return.&nbsp; Anyway, I stood before her combing out the thongs of the martinet.&nbsp; Having gotten so much experience on the receiving end, I thought I ought to know how to give a good whipping.

I just stood there eyeing her body up and down, letting the dramatic tension rise as I toyed with the whip.&nbsp; She knew what I was up to.&nbsp; Grinning at me, she said, �Fucking bitch.�

I responded by lashing her across the belly.&nbsp; Trying to play my role properly, I said �What did you call me?�

�Fucking bitch,� she replied.

I lashed her again, harder.

�Fucking bitch,� she said again.

Friendly play though it was, still I should be able to make her stop cussing me.&nbsp; So this I lashed her on the upper chest, just above those big breasts.&nbsp; That must have been more intimidating, because this time she kept quiet.

I continued to lash her.&nbsp; As hard as I dared across the ribs and belly.&nbsp; Some of the strokes made her gasp, but mostly she kept quiet.&nbsp; It was fun.&nbsp; I liked the power.

But then James said, �Jenny&#8217;s so wimpy.&nbsp; Can you even feel anything, April?�

�Of course I can feel it.�

�But it doesn&#8217;t hurt,� said James.

�It sort of hurts.&nbsp; I think she&#8217;s hitting hard enough.�

Sort of hurts?&nbsp; That wasn&#8217;t much of an endorsement.&nbsp; I lashed her harder.&nbsp; She gasped.

�Whip those big tits,� said James.&nbsp; �How can you keep avoiding such a tempting target?�

It was true that I had spared her breasts.&nbsp; With the twine already biting into her nipples, tied taut together, I wasn&#8217;t sure I should whip her breasts.&nbsp; ...At least not hard enough to satisfy the guys.

If I didn&#8217;t want to lash her breasts, I thought it would be best to change the focus downward.&nbsp; I lashed the martinet hard across&nbsp; her thighs.&nbsp; Then again.&nbsp; And again.&nbsp; April let out a gasp with each stroke.&nbsp; Yet she kept that bit of a smile on her face.

�Spread your legs,� I said.

�Oh no, not there,� said April.&nbsp; But she trusted me enough that she spread her legs.&nbsp; It wasn&#8217;t like she had to worry about getting it on the bare pussy &#8211; her bikini bottom was still on,

I laid a stroke to the inside of the thigh.&nbsp; It wasn&#8217;t a hard stroke but April wrenched reflexively.&nbsp; Then I laid on another.&nbsp; And another.&nbsp; Biting her lip and holding her breath, she kept her legs apart.&nbsp; I continued laying on stroke after stroke.

�Jenny still doesn&#8217;t whip hard enough,� said James.&nbsp; �But let&#8217;s get the rest of your clothes off.�&nbsp; With that, he started tugging down April&#8217;s bikini bottom.

April tried to resist by keeping her legs apart, but with one arm James lifted her legs off the deck and with the other hand pulled her bottom off.

�Fucking asshole.&nbsp; What if people can see?�&nbsp; But looking around under the bill of her low slung cap, she satisfied herself that no other boats were near.

James said, �Skipper, you hold one leg up.&nbsp; I&#8217;ll hold the other.&nbsp; Jenny, you&#8217;re gonna whip her pussy.�

The Skipper hesitated.&nbsp; Presumably out of concern for his family relationship with April, the Skipper seldom took the liberty of touching her.&nbsp; Finally he stepped forward and gingerly took hold of her lower leg, saying to her, �James is the boss now.&nbsp; I&#8217;m just doing what he says.&nbsp; So don&#8217;t blame me.�&nbsp;&nbsp; Even now, holding her leg up, he faced away from her.&nbsp; But when the bill of her low slung cap obscured her vision of him, he turned his head to look at her pussy.

With the guys holding her legs up and open, I had a perfect shot at her pussy.&nbsp; April was the only one of us who hadn&#8217;t yet been whipped between the legs.&nbsp; Ivy had gotten it hard with the cane.&nbsp; And I had repeatedly gotten it hard with various of the other implements.

I dangled the strands of the martinet over her pussy.&nbsp; �Are you ready?�

She responded by splitting at me ...with a smile.

�Whoa.&nbsp; Brave,� said James.&nbsp; �Not afraid of nobody.�

While April laughed, I snapped the martinet with an overhand motion, hitting lightly just above the pussy.&nbsp; She flinched but then spit at me again.&nbsp; I snapped the martinet at her again, this time landing it at the front of the pussy.

�Ow.&nbsp; Bitch.�

I did it again at the same spot.&nbsp; And then again.&nbsp; As hard as I dared to such a sensitive area.&nbsp; I kept at it, snapping the martinet to her pussy several more times.&nbsp; Each time she wrenched and gasped.

�She&#8217;s still got a awful light touch, don&#8217;t you think, Skipper?� said James.&nbsp; �After all the hard whippings she&#8217;s taken, you&#8217;d think she&#8217;d have some clue about how to dish it out.�

The Skipper just shrugged.

�Fuck that martinet,� said James, grabbing it from me.&nbsp; �Use the strap, if that&#8217;s as hard as you can swat her.�

I looked at April to see if she would object.&nbsp; She didn&#8217;t.&nbsp; So I took up the strap.&nbsp; Taking my measure, I held it out, touching her pussy with it.&nbsp; I decided an overhand stroke would be best, intending right above the pussy without actually hitting the labia.

�Wait.&nbsp; I have a better idea.&nbsp; First you&#8217;re going to fuck her with that thing,� said James, indicating the dildo fastened to the six-foot-long boat hook pole.

Was I going to do that to April?&nbsp; Why not?&nbsp; Better than having to swat her on the pussy with a strap.&nbsp; And earlier in the voyage she had fucked me with the dildo while Ivy sat on me.&nbsp; What difference did it make that it was on the end of a long pole.&nbsp; It&#8217;s just the image that&#8217;s so gross.

Taking up the pole-dildo, I moistened it with my mouth.&nbsp; The Skipper was grinning.&nbsp; I wondered if it looked like I was sucking a six-foot-long penis.

Then wielding the pole with both hands, as though I was going to impale her with a spear, I touched the end to her pussy, while the guys continued to hold her legs apart.&nbsp; Considering my aggressive stance, it is not surprising that she grimaced.&nbsp; But she said nothing.

As I applied gentle pressure, her pussy lips parted around the dildo.&nbsp; As I continued to press, it slowly slid in.&nbsp; Further...&nbsp; Slowly further...&nbsp; April took a deep breath, and it was all the way in.

I rocked the pole with a gentle motion.&nbsp; Here I had impaled my friend.&nbsp; I wondered if this is what it would be like to be a guy with a six-foot penis.&nbsp; You just fuck girls from afar.&nbsp; No need to get close.&nbsp; Get done quick and you&#8217;re out of there.&nbsp; ...Is that the ultimate guy thing?&nbsp; ...Well, not the guys I like, obviously.

Still, as I continued fucking April with the pole-dildo, I could feel a sense of power.&nbsp; It might be sort of interesting to be a man.&nbsp; But not as good as being a woman.

James grasped the pole and started thrusting it in and out.&nbsp; When I complained, �Unhand my penis, you lout,� he looked at me like I was out of my mind.&nbsp; ...Perhaps I was ...at least outside of the usual bounds of my imagination.

Letting go of the pole, James then lashed the martinet onto her pussy.&nbsp; April gasped.&nbsp; He lashed her again.&nbsp; And again.&nbsp; �Ah!&nbsp; Fuck,� she cried out.

Her pussy lips still enfolding the dildo, he lashed them three more hard strokes.&nbsp; Shlack!&nbsp; Shlack!&nbsp; Shlack!&nbsp;&nbsp; �Ow!&nbsp; No more.&nbsp; Let me down,� she cried, kicking her leg out of the Skipper&#8217;s grip.

I withdrew the dildo from her.&nbsp; But I reflected that if April&#8217;s turn was done, then mine was next.&nbsp; I didn&#8217;t mind postponing it.&nbsp; After all, April hadn&#8217;t been whipped very much.&nbsp; And her dildo fucking was gentle.&nbsp; So I said, �How about a butt spanking.&nbsp; Would that be better?�

After a pause, she replied, �Untie me first.&nbsp; Then I&#8217;ll decide if you can spank me.�

�You&#8217;re sounding uppity for girl in your position,� said James.&nbsp; �You&#8217;ll stay where you are till we decide to whip your butt.&nbsp; In the meantime I&#8217;ll whip your tits.�&nbsp; He yanked upward on the twine binding her nipples together and lashed her on the underside of her breasts.

�Ah!� she cried out.&nbsp; He lashed her again.&nbsp; And again.&nbsp; Continuing...&nbsp; Shlack.&nbsp; Shlack.&nbsp; Shlack.&nbsp; One hard stroke after another.&nbsp; Each one punctuated by a cry, �Ow.&nbsp; Fuck...&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ah...&nbsp;&nbsp; Ooh...&nbsp;&nbsp; Ah, my tits!�

I was mesmerized.&nbsp; Having tugged her nipples practically up to her mouth, James laid on stroke after stroke.&nbsp; Shlack!&nbsp; �Ow!�&nbsp;&nbsp; ...Shlack!&nbsp; �Ooh!�&nbsp;&nbsp; ...Shlack!&nbsp; �Ah!�&nbsp; April wrenched back and forth with each stroke.

James must have laid on at least two dozen strokes before he finally quit, saying, �There now that you&#8217;ve been properly whipped on the front, maybe we can let you turn around and take it on the rear.�

�Oh fuck.&nbsp; That hurt.&nbsp; And the way you were yanking on my nipples...&nbsp; Next time you want to punish somebody&#8217;s tits, do it to Jenny&#8217;s.&nbsp; She&#8217;s the one who can take it on the tits.�

I resented identification as someone who didn&#8217;t mind getting it on the breasts.&nbsp; Totally not true.&nbsp; �I don&#8217;t like anyone being rough with my breasts.�

But nobody was paying attention to me.&nbsp; Instead, to April the Skipper said, �Fortitude.&nbsp; You took it like a real heroine.�

As much as I might like the term heroine to be reserved for me, I had to admit that April had taken it bravely.&nbsp; But then maybe that also meant that I wasn&#8217;t some super-weird pain slut for all the punishment I had been accepting.

As James started untying April, the Skipper said to me, �James is right about you having a light touch.&nbsp; Here, how about if I give you a lesson on how to swing the strap?�

I didn&#8217;t actually think I needed a lesson on how to hit harder.&nbsp; I wasn&#8217;t hitting April as hard as I was able, but rather as hard as I was comfortable.&nbsp; Nevertheless, I was attentive as the Skipper took up the strap.

�Give me your left hand,� he said.&nbsp; Although uncertain why he would want to engage my weaker side, I offered it gamely.&nbsp; With his left hand he grasped my wrist firmly, raised the strap, and then...&nbsp; Whap!&nbsp; Hard across the back of my thighs.

Whap!&nbsp; �Ooh!�&nbsp;&nbsp; ...Whap!&nbsp; �Ah!�&nbsp;&nbsp; ...Whap!&nbsp; �Oh please...�&nbsp;&nbsp; Whap!&nbsp; Whap!&nbsp; Whap!&nbsp; He continued stroke after stroke across the back of my thighs.&nbsp; I punctuated each one with a cry of pain.

�This is the way to whip a girl with a strap,� he said, continuing to lay it on hard.&nbsp; I couldn&#8217;t help struggling to pull away from him, even though I felt that I should try to be brave and take my whipping.

I glanced astern to the helm to see if Rafiq was watching.&nbsp;&nbsp; ...He was!&nbsp; Moreover, Ivy was nowhere to be seen, apparently having gone below for something.&nbsp; I had Rafiq&#8217;s complete attention.&nbsp; Naked except for my bikini bottom, taking a good whipping.

Meanwhile the Skipper held fast to my wrist and continued stroke after hard stroke.&nbsp; Whap!&nbsp; Whap!&nbsp; Whap!&nbsp; Whap!&nbsp; He was making it wrap around to the inside of my left thigh.&nbsp; I writhed, struggling.&nbsp; Making momentary eye contact with Rafiq, I knew he was totally with me.&nbsp; I wrenched back and forth, shaking my breasts.&nbsp; Despite the travail, I felt so sexy.

Whap!&nbsp; �Ow!�&nbsp;&nbsp; ...Whap! �Ah!�&nbsp; One hard stroke after another.&nbsp; Sexy or no, there was a limit to how much I could take.&nbsp; The backs and insides of my thighs were stinging like mad.&nbsp; ...Whap!&nbsp; �Ooh!�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ...Whap!&nbsp; �Oh-my-god, please...�&nbsp; It felt like that strap was on fire.&nbsp; After what seemed an eternity of scorching strokes, I could take no more.&nbsp; I sank to the deck, folding my legs beside me.

Holding my left arm over my head, the Skipper moved behind me.&nbsp; When he dangled the strap in front of my bare breasts, I covered them with my right arm.&nbsp; But with the hand holding the strap, he grasped my right wrist and pulled that arm over my head.

My wrists are slender enough that he was able to grip them both with his left hand.&nbsp; As I sat unresisting, arms stretched over head, he dangled the strap in front of me, touching it to my breasts.

�Not on the tits.&nbsp; Not with a strap,� I pleaded, throwing my head back to look up at him.&nbsp; �That&#8217;s not fair.�

Yet I was reveling in my vulnerability.&nbsp; He probably would not wallop me on the breasts with that awful thing.&nbsp; But he could.&nbsp; The feeling of surrendering my body was so arousing.&nbsp; And I knew that Rafiq&#8217;s eyes were on me.

My nipples were so stiff as the strap bumped over them.&nbsp; Imploring, I looked up at the Skipper.&nbsp; A light slap on the side of the breast.&nbsp; Squirming, I murmured, �Not on the tits...�

He continued light slaps to my breasts with the strap.&nbsp; A few right on the nipples.&nbsp; Even though they were not hard strokes, directed to the nipples, I couldn&#8217;t help squirming.

As the strokes increased in intensity, I said, �I&#8217;ll whip April really hard, the way you want.&nbsp; Just don&#8217;t beat me on the tits.�

He continued slapping my breasts as I writhed helpless.&nbsp; Then he paused and knelt behind me, setting aside the strap.&nbsp; As he let go of my wrists, he said, �Keep your arms up.�

As I held my arms overhead, wrists crossed as though bound, he put his hands to my breasts, his fingers bumping over my stiff nipples.&nbsp; Then he pressed hard into my breasts.&nbsp; �Squeeze the fat,� he murmured.

He pressed my breasts this way and that.&nbsp; Then he took hold of my nipples and pinched hard.&nbsp; �Ow...� I murmured, bringing my hands down to try to protect myself.

Still holding me by the nipples, he pulled me upwards, making me rise to my feet.&nbsp; Releasing my nipples, he murmured.�Wonderful titties.�&nbsp; Then he stroked his hands more gently over my breasts, but still firmly pressing their softness.&nbsp; Now I didn&#8217;t resist.

�Stick &#8217;em out there,� he ordered.&nbsp; As I straightened my posture, he put an arm around me and bent me back.&nbsp; He put his lips to my breast and started sucking.&nbsp; He was making me respond to him sexually.&nbsp; I pressed my crotch onto his thigh.

This went on for a few moments before I pushed him away.&nbsp; I was not comfortable responding sexually to the Skipper with Rafiq looking on.

At this point James had already untied April.&nbsp; As she loosened the twine from her nipples, she was looking over her breasts and rubbing them.&nbsp; She allowed James to do likewise.&nbsp; The undersides were flushed where James had whipped them.

I glanced astern at Rafiq.&nbsp; Ivy had returned.&nbsp; She had changed into that beautiful long purple dress she wore the time she took on a mistress/slave relationship with me naked having to service her.

In her hand she had the cat-o-nine-tails.&nbsp; Oddly, she was also holding a pair of white pants.&nbsp; It seemed that she wanted him to change into them.&nbsp; He did not seem receptive to the idea.

The Skipper, also watching, said, �Those have gotta be mine.&nbsp; Why does Ivy want him to wear my white pants?�

I said, �Maybe she wants him to look like a sailor.�

As Rafiq continued to refuse the white pants, he glanced in my direction.&nbsp; �Yes.&nbsp; Do it,� I called out, nodding my head vigorously.

Looking at me, Rafiq knitted his brow.&nbsp; Then he turned to Ivy and took the pants, although his body language expressed peevishness.&nbsp; I had to smile.&nbsp; I could get Rafiq to do things when Ivy could not.&nbsp; Yes!

Rafiq dropped his shorts.&nbsp; He had no underwear on.&nbsp; His penis was somewhat stiff.&nbsp; I was sure that was because he had been watching me taking the strap.&nbsp; I was sure I had looked so alluring, struggling bare breasted and all.

As Rafiq put on the pants, the Skipper was muttering to himself, apparently about Rafiq not wearing underwear when he put on borrowed pants.&nbsp; But considering the impositions us women had been putting up with, I had little sympathy.

Meanwhile, James had been unable to convince April to let him retie her.&nbsp; But facing the stern she was holding onto the mast arching her back, sticking out her ass while James stroked and lightly slapped it.

�Okay, Jenny,� said James.&nbsp; �You gotta finish disciplining April.&nbsp; Now tell her, &#8216;you&#8217;re to be whipped hard, because you deserve it.&#8217;�

Taking up the strap and touching it to April&#8217;s rear, I mechanically repeated James words, �You&#8217;re to whipped hard because you deserve it.�

�No,� said the Skipper.&nbsp; �You said it poorly.&nbsp; It&#8217;s &#8216;you&#8217;re to be whipped hard... because you deserve it.&#8217;&nbsp; For saying it wrong, I&#8217;m going to discipline you.�&nbsp; There was a twinkle in his eye.

Taking the strap from me, Whap!&nbsp; To the back of my thighs.&nbsp; �Ooh.�&nbsp;&nbsp; Whap!&nbsp; �Ow!�&nbsp; Whap!&nbsp; Whap!&nbsp; Whap!&nbsp; Whap!&nbsp; A total of six hard strokes in rapid succession.&nbsp; I knew I still had Rafiq&#8217;s attention.

Giving me back the strap, the Skipper said, �Now say it right.�

This time I took care to emphasize the right word, saying, �You&#8217;re to be whipped hard... because you deserve it.�

�Okay,� said James.&nbsp; �Now give it to her.�

Taking my measure, I touched the strap to her rear.&nbsp; Then I drew it back and swatted her with it.&nbsp; April didn&#8217;t flinch.&nbsp; I knew I hadn&#8217;t done it hard enough.&nbsp; Again I drew it back.&nbsp; Whap!&nbsp; This one was hard enough to elicit a murmur.

I continued swatting her, increasing the intensity.&nbsp; The good strokes have just the right sound... a pitched Whap!&nbsp; And April would respond with satisfying �Ah!�

I laid on one hard stroke after another.&nbsp; I was entranced by the discharge of force.&nbsp; ...An exhilaration of power.&nbsp; ...And April was taking it really well.&nbsp; She held her position at the mast, although she would kick back a foot or shake her body after particularly hard strokes.

James stood next to her with his arm around her body, giving her encouragement.&nbsp; He had a hand pressing into each of her big boobs.&nbsp; The Skipper looked on, seeming to have his eyes on me as much as on April.

April&#8217;s butt was getting really red.&nbsp; I paused and passed my hand over it.&nbsp; It was hot.&nbsp; When James started looking it over, April straightened and rubbed her butt, also trying to look back at it.

�A good butt beating,� said James.

�How many more do I have to take?�

�Till you&#8217;re ready to be fucked.�

�All right, you win.&nbsp; I&#8217;m ready now.�

�But Jenny wants to give you a few more swats... to finish strongly,� said James.&nbsp; �Right?�

With the Skipper waiting to give me a whipping, I thought it best not to express an opinion.&nbsp; �Whatever.&nbsp; It&#8217;s not my decision.&nbsp; I&#8217;m just following orders.�

�Bend over again so Jenny can finish up,� said James.

April looked first at James, then at me.&nbsp; Then she decided to comply.&nbsp; When she bent over again, holding the mast, I took my measure.&nbsp; Her butt was really red.&nbsp; I aimed lower, and gave her a hard swat at the juncture of the buns and thighs.&nbsp; She gasped.&nbsp; Then I gave her one a little lower, on the back of the thighs.&nbsp; She gasped again and shook her body.

James said, �Legs apart,� tugging sideways on her legs.&nbsp; I put the strap between her thighs and tapped from side to side.&nbsp; She responded by continuing to inch her legs apart.&nbsp; I continued the encouragement until they were well apart.

Her vulva was now prominently displayed.&nbsp; April was the only one of us girls who had not been swatted on the pussy with a strap.&nbsp; But I had no wish to give it to her.&nbsp; Instead, I gave her a swat on the inside of the thigh.&nbsp; �Ow, fuck,� she moaned, writhing.&nbsp; Too hard, I thought to myself.

I gave her another one, not so hard.&nbsp; She took that one a little better, so I gave her several more that way on the inside of the thigh.&nbsp; Then some harder strokes on the back of thighs.

�Haven&#8217;t I taken enough?� said April.&nbsp; �Isn&#8217;t it my turn to whip Jenny now.�

�Just a few more,� said James.&nbsp; �On the butt.�

After a pause I gave her a hard swat on her red butt.&nbsp; Then another.&nbsp; And a third.&nbsp; Since this series was to be the last, I thought I could give it to her hard.

�Lay the last ones on thick and fast,� said James.

Accordingly, I laid them on in rapid succession... Whap! Whap! Whap! Whap! Whap! Whap! All hard on the same spot.

�Ahhhh!�&nbsp; April dropped to her knees, bending forward, hands on her rear.&nbsp; �Ow-ow-ow...�&nbsp; She was gasping and panting.&nbsp; I understood the crescendo of pain that was sweeping over her.

James dropped down next to her, pushing her forward onto all fours.&nbsp; He was nuzzling her and fondling her breasts.&nbsp; Receptive, she arched her back.&nbsp; Then he dropped trou, preparing to enter her doggy style.

But she turned her rear away from him.&nbsp; Playing hard to get, she murmured, �A man.&nbsp; Trying to fuck me after my beating.�&nbsp; She pushed him away.

Wrestling with her, both still on their knees, James tried to get her into a position where he could enter from the rear.&nbsp; But she continued to put just enough resistance to thwart him.&nbsp; I couldn&#8217;t take my eyes off the spectacle.&nbsp; Both of them were having a good time.&nbsp; James had a hell of a boner.

After a time James managed to get hold both her wrists from behind.&nbsp; Seizing the rope, he bound them together behind her.&nbsp; Murmuring, �Gotta get the girl down.&nbsp; Get her down,� he yanked up on the rope, forcing her head down to the deck.

He wrapped the rope around the mast.&nbsp; On her knees, head on deck, arms yanked up behind her, she murmured, �Now the fucker&#8217;s got me good.�&nbsp; As James entered her, I felt awkward watching.&nbsp; Time to direct my attention elsewhere.

As I moved away from them, I felt some envy for April.&nbsp; She made herself so exciting.&nbsp; Why didn&#8217;t I think of resisting Rafiq and the Skipper&#8217;s advances as a way to inflame their passions?&nbsp; Instead, it seemed that I was always so passive, letting them whip the shit out of me before they took me.

But now in the stern, there was a different spectacle.&nbsp; Ivy, behind Rafiq as he handled the helm, had the cat-o-nine-tails and had started whipping him with it.&nbsp; Stoic, his expression determined, he did not acknowledge the strokes.

Coming up behind me, the Skipper put his hands on my sides, pressing firmly on my ribs.&nbsp; Holding me against himself, we watched as Ivy gradually increased the intensity of her strokes.&nbsp; The Skipper pressed his hands on the base of my breasts and said, �Hands behind your head.�

Still feeling the sting of his hard strapping on the legs, my natural inclination was simply to obey.&nbsp; But why not brave noncompliance?&nbsp; I covered my breasts with my hands and said, �I shouldn&#8217;t allow a man who whips me to touch my breasts.�

The Skipper laughed and slid his hand down my stomach toward my nether region.&nbsp; With one hand I tried gently to fend him off as he slid his hand under my swimsuit bottom.&nbsp; With the other hand I tried to protect my breasts.&nbsp; I said, �You&#8217;re not going to take advantage of me, are you?�

The Skipper&#8217;s breathing quickened.&nbsp; From under his shorts, I could feel his hard penis against my body.&nbsp; I said, �I can tell it turns you on to take me against my will.�

�Or does it turn me on to bend you to my will?&nbsp; In the end you&#8217;ll submit.&nbsp; But perhaps not without a struggle.�&nbsp; Holding me from behind, one hand inside my swimsuit, his finger was pressing into my slit.&nbsp; With his other hand he grasped my breast.

I countered by trying to disengage his hand from my pussy.&nbsp; Not too strenuously, just enough to make things difficult.&nbsp; My resistance seemed to stimulate him.&nbsp; He redoubled his efforts.&nbsp; He was trying to get his finger up my tunnel.&nbsp; �Ow...�&nbsp; Now I thought he was getting too rough.&nbsp; Twisting away from him, I broke from his grip.

I stood facing him, hands in front of me.&nbsp; Giving a catty hiss, I bent my fingers as though baring my claws.&nbsp; With my short-trimmed fingernails, that was not actually much of a threat.&nbsp; He lunged at me but I dodged away.&nbsp; Again he tried to get me but I kept away from him.

Backing away from him, I knew I would eventually get cornered in the bow.&nbsp; When I could go no further, I stood facing him.&nbsp; Play though this might be, I still didn&#8217;t want him to succeed in getting me.&nbsp; As he closed in, I gave a squeal and tried to duck around him.&nbsp; But there wasn&#8217;t enough room, and he caught me around the waist and lifted me off the deck.

As he carried me back toward the mast, I kicked and struggled and complained.&nbsp; At the mast April and James were locked together in climax, April gasping with pleasure and James grunting bullishly.&nbsp; And here I was, nearly naked, seized by a lustful man intend on working his will on me.

Bending on one knee next to his bag of devices the Skipper pulled me over his thigh.&nbsp; As I tried to wriggle free, he reached in and pulled out the leather handcuffs.&nbsp; Then he slapped me on the butt.&nbsp; And again, harder.&nbsp; And a third, yet harder.

When I reached back to protect myself, he took hold of my wrist and fastened the cuff.&nbsp; Then he gave me another hard spank.&nbsp; I was ready to be bound.&nbsp; Ostensibly to ward off his spanks I reached back my other hand and let him fasten the other cuff.

Now bound with my wrists behind my back, I struggled no more.&nbsp; He passed his hand up and down over my butt.&nbsp; Then he stroked the backs of my thighs.&nbsp; �How do your strap welts feel?�

�Stinging.&nbsp; You whip me so hard.�

�Even so, you&#8217;re still rebellious.&nbsp; Like I said yesterday, I must not be whipping you enough.�

�Rebellious or compliant, you give it to me the same.�

�No.&nbsp; It&#8217;s more fun to whip the rebel.�

He assisted me to my feet.&nbsp; I faced him, bare breasted, wrists bound behind me.&nbsp; I felt vulnerable ...and very sexy.&nbsp; I glanced at Rafiq, at the helm.&nbsp; Ivy, behind him, draping the cat-o-nine-tails over his shoulder, was now caressing him.&nbsp; But his eyes were on me.&nbsp; I liked it that he had seen the spectacle of me being subdued.

The Skipper put his hands to my ribs at the sides of my breasts, and held me.&nbsp; Looking down into my eyes, he said, �Are you ready to go down like April?�

�To let a depraved man like you enter me?&nbsp; Never.&nbsp; I&#8217;d throw myself into the ocean first.�&nbsp; Rhetoric aside, I genuinely was not receptive to getting fucked out here in front of the others.&nbsp; And I wondered if anyone on the other boats in the bay was watching through binoculars.

His hands stroked my breasts.&nbsp; Then he took hold of my nipples and pinched.&nbsp; I threw my head back and writhed.&nbsp; Knowing that Rafiq&#8217;s eyes were on me, I wanted to make a big show of being tortured.&nbsp; And it did hurt... some.

After a moment he released me.&nbsp; I stepped back, gasping as I looked down at my body.&nbsp; �You always have to go after my nipples.�

Turning me toward the stern the Skipper held me from behind, saying �And your sailor boyfriend has to watch your ordeal.&nbsp; Do you think he&#8217;s troubled seeing you get punished?&nbsp; Or is he secretly turned on by seeing you get what you deserve?�

Playing into the fantasy, I said, �He&#8217;d rescue me now if he could.&nbsp; But Ivy&#8217;s giving him his own punishment.&nbsp; We&#8217;re being punished for our love.�

Holding me tightly, fingers pressing into my breasts, he said, �Are you going down for me?�

�In my heart you can never displace Rafiq.�

�But he just a sailor.&nbsp; I&#8217;m the captain.�

�I&#8217;ll never consent.&nbsp; And you wouldn&#8217;t dare rape me or Rafiq would kill you when he gets free.�&nbsp; Cuffed hands behind me, I grasped his stiff penis through his pants and worked it.&nbsp; I was reveling in the edgy play.&nbsp; I wanted some kind of sexual action, but I didn&#8217;t want him to enter me.

The Skipper said, �We should both rape you for all the sass you give us.�

�Evil men.�

�If you won&#8217;t go down, then you&#8217;ll have to give me a blow job.�

�And take your penis in my mouth?&nbsp; Such an indignity.&nbsp; How could I suffer that?�

Cocking his finger against his thumb, he released it with a snap across the nub of my right nipple.

�Ah! ...Fuck.&nbsp; What are you doing?�

As he threatened again with cocked finger, I squirmed but could not evade the flick across my other nipple.&nbsp; �Ow...&nbsp; Don&#8217;t snap me there.�&nbsp; I squeezed his penis hard.

Again he snapped my nipple.&nbsp; Then again.&nbsp; �Ooh...&nbsp; Ow...�&nbsp; Though I squeezed hard on his penis, he didn&#8217;t seem to interpret it as retaliation.&nbsp; Rather it aroused him more.&nbsp; It was a big hard boner.

Two more hard flicks to my nipples.&nbsp; �Ahh...&nbsp; No more.&nbsp; Maybe I can do what you want.�

As I dropped to my knees, he said, �Good girl.&nbsp; First you pleasure me.&nbsp; Then you&#8217;ll get your own when we lash you to the mast.�

I glanced toward Rafiq.&nbsp; But now he wasn&#8217;t even facing me.&nbsp; Sandwiched between Ivy and the helm, he was embracing her as she steered.&nbsp; Damn.&nbsp; ...Well fuck &#8216;em.

Sitting on my heels, wrists bound behind me, I turned my attention to the Skipper as he held his penis to my mouth.&nbsp; In his other hand he held the cane.&nbsp; As I licked his glans, he played the cane over my breasts.

I trusted that he would not hit me.&nbsp; But still, getting whacked on the breasts with a cane is not something I ever want to happen, so I thought I better hurry up and get him to come off.&nbsp; I took his penis in my mouth.

He continued stroking my breasts with the cane, pressing them this way and that.&nbsp; Then he played it over the inside of my thighs.&nbsp; I was sucking for all I was worth.

He tapped the cane hard on my pussy.&nbsp; By reflex I closed my legs some.&nbsp; But he tapped back and forth hard on the inside of my thighs till I opened up more.&nbsp; Then he plunked the cane onto my pussy, right over the clit.

Without opening my mouth, I gave a grunt.&nbsp; Then he did it again, same place.&nbsp; I grimaced in pain, but continued my work.&nbsp; But he did it again, harder.&nbsp; And if that didn&#8217;t hurt enough, he did it yet again, harder still.

Continuing to suck on his penis, I looked up into his eyes, entreating.&nbsp; What was I doing to deserve a caning on the pussy?

�I like your eyes,� he said.&nbsp; �I like you to beg with your eyes.�

I continued looking up at him with my most plaintiff expression.&nbsp; Sucking as hard as I could, I never took my eyes off his.

Now rubbing the cane firmly over my breasts, he said, �You&#8217;re going to get your tits whipped good and hard today.&nbsp; But maybe not with the cane.&nbsp;&nbsp; ...But then again, maybe those titties need a good caning.�

I shook my head entreating him not to whack me on the breasts.&nbsp; He tapped firmly on the side of my breast, saying, �I like to see your girl flesh jiggle.�

As he continued tapping the side of my breast, I squirmed and wrenched trying to satisfy his demand for jiggling girl flesh, without him needing to hit me any harder.&nbsp; ...I was desperate to get him to come off, working the bottom side of his penis with my tongue.

Putting the cane back between my legs, he snapped it on the inside of the thigh.&nbsp; Then twice more in rapid succession.&nbsp; Then a hard one on the pussy.&nbsp; And another.&nbsp; And another.&nbsp; I flinched with each stroke but continued my work.&nbsp; If he wasn&#8217;t going to come off without tormenting me, then I would just have to take it until I could get him to come off.

Blinking back tears, I continued entreating him with my eyes as I worked his penis with my mouth.&nbsp; Finally pulses of cum began to spurt into my mouth.&nbsp; With a series of bullish grunts, he discharged his vital oils.

When the throes of his orgasm finally quieted, he withdrew from my mouth.&nbsp; I hesitated only a moment wondering if I was expected to swallow.&nbsp; Then I hocked a stupendous loogie toward the ocean.&nbsp; ...But it failed to clear the boat.&nbsp; I looked at that massive gob of spattered cum and saliva.&nbsp; Then I looked at the Skipper and said, �Oops.�

�Girls,� he said, shaking his head.&nbsp; �Never learned to spit.&nbsp; ...And what a girl you are.�&nbsp; He dropped to his knees behind me.&nbsp; With his arms around my front he hugged me close, his hard-edged energy now reduced.

As I sat enjoying his solicitude, a sail boat was approaching going in the opposite direction.&nbsp; My wrists still bound behind me, I tried to turn away from them, but the Skipper tightened his embrace.&nbsp; Squirming, I said, �I don&#8217;t want them to see me topless.�

The Skipper put his hands on my breasts and pressed them around.&nbsp; The other sailboat was passing closely.&nbsp; Two men and three young teenage boys were watching us.&nbsp; Scolding the Skipper I said, �Quit being gross.&nbsp; They can see you&#8217;re feeling me up.�

The Skipper responded by letting my nipples show and squeezing my breasts this way and that.&nbsp; He held me firmly as I squirmed.&nbsp; I turned my head away so my hair would at least prevent them from seeing my face.

After they past I said, �Asshole.&nbsp; Why did you have to humiliate me like that?�

�I just let your beauty brighten their day.�

�Well, what about my day?�

�What about it?&nbsp; Aren&#8217;t you pleased that you can brighten somebody&#8217;s day?�

�Oh, you...�&nbsp; I knew I couldn&#8217;t provide a rational explanation for something so fundamentally obvious as why I don&#8217;t want people gaping at me.&nbsp; When the Skipper released my wrists from the cuffs, I stood with one arm across my chest.

At this point, April had long since put her bikini back on and gone astern with James.&nbsp; With them minding the helm, Ivy and Rafiq now came forward.&nbsp; As Rafiq eyed my body, I let one nipple peak through my arm.

Ivy still had the cat-o-nine-tails.&nbsp; �Check out my handiwork,� she said.&nbsp; �Show them your back, Rafiq.�

Rafiq ignored her and said to the Skipper, �Can&#8217;t be more than a hour to the marina, do you think?�

�Maybe a little more.&nbsp; But we&#8217;re not far,� replied the Skipper.

Unobtrusively I slipped behind Rafiq.&nbsp; I just had to see his whip marks.&nbsp; ...There they were.&nbsp; The knots on that whip leave distinct welts.&nbsp; I wanted to give them some little kisses to make them feel better.&nbsp; But knowing that he would never acknowledge that the whipping was bothersome, I wondered whether my solicitude would just annoy him.

As Rafiq made some small talk to the Skipper about the wind, I very lightly kissed his back.&nbsp; As he did not respond negatively, I continued giving him little kisses, moving here and there among the welts.&nbsp; Rafiq made no acknowledgment.&nbsp; But I sensed that he enjoyed what I was doing.

After a time, he said to the Skipper, �Well, it seems that Jenny is overdue for being tied to the mast.�

�That was the plan.&nbsp; Yet looking at her now my eyes just see a gentle creature who little deserves more punishment.&nbsp; Think I&#8217;ll go aft and relax.&nbsp; Besides with all these other people coming to and fro on the bay, it will look better if it&#8217;s female on female.&nbsp; Better with me out of the way.�

As the Skipper went aft, Ivy flaunted her lash and said, �I want her hung on the mast.&nbsp; String her up, Rafiq.�

I&#8217;m sure it was her imperious tone that got Rafiq.&nbsp; Looking at her like she was crazy, he said, �Are you having delusions of grandeur?�

�Come on, Rafiq,� she said, her tone now wheedling.&nbsp; �You said we could reverse roles.&nbsp; And Jenny likes it this way.&nbsp; She knows I&#8217;ll take care of her.�

I said, �Well, with your long dress, you look the part of the mistress of the vessel.&nbsp; And Rafiq the handsome deck-hand sailor.&nbsp; But what am I?�

�The beautiful captive,� said Rafiq.

�From a distance people out there could think you&#8217;re just the long-haired cabin boy who needs to be disciplined,� said Ivy.&nbsp; �Hung with arms overhead, you&#8217;re flat enough to pass as one.�

Rafiq frowned at her.&nbsp; It always annoyed him when she insulted me.&nbsp; ...And I always took some pleasure in that dynamic.

She must have sensed that she had overstepped.&nbsp; �Of course, those puffy nipples couldn&#8217;t be a guy&#8217;s,� she said, poking at me with the handle of the whip.&nbsp; �On second thought, most everything about you is all wrong for a boy.�

I pushed the whip handle away from my breasts.&nbsp; She could say whatever she pleased.&nbsp; I just wanted Rafiq to tie me up.&nbsp; Stepping to face the mast, I clasped it and said, �You&#8217;re going to have your way with me.&nbsp; There&#8217;s nothing I can do.�

�No, you&#8217;re going to face outward,� said Ivy.

�People will see me topless.&nbsp; What are they going to think?�

�Actually it&#8217;s not that big a deal to be topless out here,� said Rafiq.&nbsp; �On the other hand, maybe it&#8217;s not so common to see topless girls tied to the mast.&nbsp; Anyway, first I need to do up your wrists in the front.�

Letting him turn me outward, I clasped my hands together covering my breasts.&nbsp; He took up the handcuffs and began to put them on me.&nbsp; As he did so, I positioned my wrists to maximize his contact with my breasts.&nbsp; My nipples were stiff.

With my wrists now bound together, Rafiq took a rope and fastened it to the chain linking my hand cuffs.&nbsp; Again I positioned my wrists so that he had to touch my breast as he did so.&nbsp; Smiling, he took the opportunity to press my girl flesh and rub my nipple.

With Rafiq positioned in front of me, Ivy could not see that I was having him play with my body.&nbsp; But her brow was furled.&nbsp; Perhaps from my smirk she suspected something.

That finished, he looped the rope over a fastening protrusion on the mast above my head.&nbsp; As he pulled my arms over my head I quickly turned to face the mast.

�Outward,� said Ivy.

�Ivy, just relax,� replied Rafiq, as he pulled me up on tiptoe.&nbsp; Then he fastened the other end of the rope, thus affixing me to the mast.

Assuming that they had it in mind that I should be whipped, I wondered whether I should accept the cat-o-nine-tails or insist on something not so harsh.&nbsp; If Ivy didn&#8217;t whip that hard, maybe it would be bearable.&nbsp; But it seemed best to ask for something else.&nbsp; Or maybe Rafiq wouldn&#8217;t let her whip me at all.&nbsp; That would be a refreshing change.

From behind me Rafiq nuzzled his cheek against mine.&nbsp; My freedom of movement gone, I quieted my thoughts by raising awareness of the senses.&nbsp; The warmth of the sun, the beauty of the sea, the smooth cold mast pressing against my front, Rafiq&#8217;s warm furry chest against my back.&nbsp; So why not just let go, leave the choices to others, and experience whatever came my way?

Putting his hands to my armpits, Rafiq slid his hands down my breasts, each finger bumping over my stiff nipples, and slowly on down my ribs, coming to rest on my hips.

Murmuring into my ear, �The mistress insists on whipping the beautiful captive, just for being beautiful,� Rafiq, holding me by the hips, turned me around, outward.

The thought of facing Ivy&#8217;s cat-o-nine-tails overwhelmed my mind.&nbsp; So much for calm acceptance of whatever came my way.&nbsp; �Why do I always have to be whipped on the front?&nbsp; I whined.&nbsp; �Ivy only whipped you on the back.&nbsp; It isn&#8217;t fair.�

�I know it isn&#8217;t,� said Rafiq.&nbsp; �Soft breast.&nbsp; Biting whip.&nbsp; It seems so wrong.&nbsp; Why do I love it?�

�Because you&#8217;re such a pervert.�

�But it&#8217;s the wrong whip, right?�&nbsp; Then to Ivy he said, �What else do we have for a whip?&nbsp; You can&#8217;t use the cat on Jenny&#8217;s front.�

�Why not?� said Ivy, grinning.&nbsp; �If Jenny were as stoic getting it on the front as you were, getting it on the back, it would prove that girls are tougher than guys.�

I said, �I&#8217;m not trying to prove anything.&nbsp; I just don&#8217;t want to get it on the front with the cat.&nbsp; Anything else.&nbsp; Except not the cane either.&nbsp; And not the switch either.�

�Well what&#8217;s left?� asked Ivy. �And who the hell do you think you are setting all these conditions.&nbsp; I&#8217;ll whip you with whatever I feel like.�

�No you won&#8217;t,� said Rafiq.&nbsp; �Not if Jenny tells you no.�

�What if she tells you no?� said Ivy.

�She won&#8217;t.�

�Bullshit, Rafiq.&nbsp; It&#8217;s me she won&#8217;t say no to.�

�Whatever,� said Rafiq, becoming impatient.&nbsp; �Just use the right whip and it won&#8217;t be an issue.&nbsp; What do we have here?�

As they looked into the Skipper&#8217;s bag, I said, �Actually, I want you to try that short single-thong whip that James used on April early on our trip.&nbsp; We never saw that again.&nbsp; Ask the Skipper where it is.�

�No way,� said Ivy.&nbsp; �Too wimpy.�

�Use the long whip,� said Rafiq, referring to the device with the meter-long lash attached to a stiff meter-long crop.&nbsp; �Everybody likes that one.&nbsp; Or at least likes to wield it.�

�All right,� said Ivy.&nbsp; �With a potential audience out there, we need something that looks impressive.�

�Go back and ask the Skipper for it,� said Rafiq.&nbsp; �I need to tie Jenny&#8217;s feet up.�

Ivy gave him a dissatisfied look.&nbsp; She might have felt that she should be giving the orders.&nbsp; But she said nothing.&nbsp; As she started past me, going aft, she stopped and looked me over.

With a smirk she said, �Jenny, I think you&#8217;re overdressed.�&nbsp; Then she yanked down my swimsuit bottom.&nbsp; Bound up on tiptoe and caught completely off-guard, it was below my knees before could react to hinder it.&nbsp; Now it was too late.&nbsp; All I could do is plead, �Ivy, please.&nbsp; This is so embarrassing.&nbsp; Isn&#8217;t it enough to be topless out here.�

�Your type isn&#8217;t entitled to clothes,� she replied, pulling them the rest of the way down and off.&nbsp; As Rafiq looked on with an amused expression, Ivy slid her finger through my slit, no doubt to demonstrate that I had no right to personal space even for my most private area.&nbsp; Then taking my swimsuit bottom with her, she continued on her way aft in search of a better whip.

�Rafiq, why did you let her do that?� I demanded.

With a guilty smile, he replied, �Who was I to interfere with doings between you girls?�

�Asshole.&nbsp; If we end up getting arrested or something, it&#8217;ll be your fault.�

Rafiq shrugged.&nbsp; Then he took up a rope and started binding it to my right ankle.&nbsp; Since I was bound arms overhead, I said, �I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ll be going anywhere, tied up as I am.&nbsp; What&#8217;s with tying my ankles?�&nbsp; I was concerned about having him stretch my legs apart, blatantly exposing me.

�Don&#8217;t worry.&nbsp; You&#8217;re going to like this.�

�That sounds ominous.�

Rafiq continued on my other ankle.&nbsp; I glanced around at the surroundings.&nbsp; The bay was had become narrower and increasingly crowded with boats.&nbsp; But none were especially close by, and in any case I knew my hair obscured my face.

With both ankles now affixed by each end of the rope, Rafiq stepped behind the mast.&nbsp; �Eek!� I let out a little cry as he pulled my feet off the deck, suspending all my weight from my wrists.&nbsp; �What are you doing to me?�

�This is good, isn&#8217;t it?� he replied.&nbsp; Now with my knees bent and my feet pulled up to the level of my butt, he fastened the ankle rope behind the mast.&nbsp; My ankle bindings were now bearing some of my weight, but suspended with arched back, butt pressed against the mast, knees splayed on either side of the mast, I felt stretched and vulnerable.

�You&#8217;ve hung me.&nbsp; I can&#8217;t move at all.�

Stepping in front of me, Rafiq eyed my nakedness.&nbsp; With an expression of unbridled lust he murmured, �Oh my god.&nbsp; This is the ultimate.�

Pressing his shirtless body to mine, he clutched me firmly on the sides of my ribs.&nbsp; His hands worked their way up to my armpits.&nbsp; Then slowly down on my breasts.&nbsp; His thumbs pressed on my nipples.&nbsp; I worked my crotch against his thigh.&nbsp; My whole body was tingling with erotic energy.

Suspended as I was on the mast, I had an image of myself hung crux simplex &#8211; that is, crucified without a crossbar, just plain nailed to a tree trunk.&nbsp; In some past lifetime 2000 years ago, had I been crucified that way?&nbsp; One nail through both wrists crossed overhead, and a nail through each foot at the level of my buttocks into the sides of the tree trunk?

Was my fascination with bondage and punishment just the reverberations from that calamitous experience?

If such a thing had happened, I wondered if a guarding Roman soldier had raped me?&nbsp; And perverse as it sounds, could I have had the untoward response of an orgasm?&nbsp; Was all this stuff I was going through on this voyage the repercussions of&nbsp; feelings that I turned myself from a passive victim into an active participant in my downfall on that fateful day?

As these thoughts came and then went, there remained the here and now with Rafiq pressing against me as I hung on the mast.&nbsp; I was gasping with arousal.&nbsp; I wanted him to enter me.

Or did I want him to unfasten me and let me down?&nbsp; To go lie down with him in the cabin.&nbsp; Ordinary sex.&nbsp; Gentle loving sex.

As his fingers started on my clit, I didn&#8217;t want down.&nbsp; I wanted it right there hanging on the mast.&nbsp;&nbsp; As his fingers continued to kindle my arousal, the erotic sensations were building to a climax.&nbsp; I didn&#8217;t care whether he entered me.&nbsp; I was going to come off right now.

�Frigging the little bitch, eh?� interrupted the returning Ivy.&nbsp; �Well I&#8217;ve got something that will stimulate her better than you can.&nbsp; She always responds to the whip.�

The impending orgasm retreated.&nbsp; Damn it.

Leaving off with fingering my pussy and separating himself just far enough that I couldn&#8217;t press into him given my limited freedom of motion, I wasn&#8217;t going to be able to come off.

�That&#8217;s sweet, the way you hung her on the mast,� said Ivy, patting me on the side of the butt.&nbsp; �Now move aside.&nbsp; It&#8217;s time for her to feel the whip.�

As Rafiq continued to stand before me, his hands passed over my breasts.&nbsp; Then he gave my nipples a pinch.&nbsp; �Ooh.�&nbsp; I bit my lip as he gripped my nipples and pulled upwards.&nbsp; �Oh... Rafiq...�

Finally he eased his grip and softly stroked my breasts.&nbsp; His hands moved down my sides and onto my hips.&nbsp; His face moved close.&nbsp; Our lips met.&nbsp; His body pressed against mine.&nbsp; Now I could press my crotch against him.&nbsp; Such an embrace.

Swish...thack.&nbsp; Ivy had stroked the long whip across his back.&nbsp; He exhaled abruptly but made no other sound. ...Swish...thack.&nbsp; Another stroke across his back.&nbsp; ...Then another.&nbsp; And another.

Ivy laid one stroke after another onto Rafiq as he embraced me.&nbsp; The lashes were meant for me, but he had offered his body in order to spare mine.&nbsp; My gallant defender.

The next stroke she rapped around to catch me on the side of the ribs.&nbsp; I let out a little yelp.&nbsp; Again she lashed me on the side.&nbsp; I pressed my crotch onto Rafiq&#8217;s thigh.&nbsp; In a lovers embrace, we were being whipped together by a jealous mistress.&nbsp; My mind was swept by the romantic vision.

Stroke after stroke Ivy laid across Rafiq&#8217;s back, rapping it around to sting me on the side.&nbsp; Rafiq took it in silence.&nbsp; But I made a special point of registering each stroke with a loud gasp or yelp, noisier than I ever would be if Ivy were whipping me alone.&nbsp; I would not compete with Rafiq&#8217;s stoicism.&nbsp; I wanted him to be the strong one.

Ivy started snapping it at me with overhand strokes that missed Rafiq and caught me directly on the side of my ribs, or on the side of my butt and thigh.

�I don&#8217;t know why you&#8217;re trying to protect her,� said Ivy.&nbsp; �I&#8217;m going to have my way with her.�&nbsp; Then she sliced the whip again across Rafiq&#8217;s back.

Caught up in the romance of the moment, I murmured, �I&#8217;m the one who deserves the whip.&nbsp; But you&#8217;re the one who&#8217;s bearing the brunt &#8211; all to protect me.�

�If I expose you, she&#8217;ll whip your breasts.�

�Would she be that cruel?�

�Such a jealous mistress.�

Playing on the edge of fantasy and reality, Rafiq understood my mind.&nbsp; I pressed my crotch to him as Ivy continued lashing us.&nbsp; Stroke after stroke across his back, rapping around to catch me on the side.

�Move aside Rafiq,� said Ivy.

Being whipped with my guy by a jealous Ivy was the ultimate erotic charge.&nbsp; Certain that he would continue to protect me, I murmured in his ear, �Save yourself.�

�I&#8217;ll triple her punishment,� said Ivy, continuing to lash us.

Rafiq moved slightly to the side, loosening his embrace.&nbsp; Then he let go of me, moving aside, exposing me to Ivy.&nbsp; Even though I had told him to save himself, I hadn&#8217;t actually thought he would do it.&nbsp; But considering that he loved to see me whipped, I suppose I should have expected it.

Ivy aimed the next stroke to the inside of my thigh, hard.&nbsp; I yelped with the pain.&nbsp; But now it was just me versus Ivy.&nbsp; I was not going to be weak.&nbsp; She lashed there me again, even closer to my pussy.&nbsp; This time I did not cry out, but I couldn&#8217;t help panting.

Two more stinging strokes on the inside of the thigh.&nbsp; Then the&nbsp; next stroke stung my pussy.&nbsp; �Ahhhh!&nbsp; Fuck.�

Swish...thack.&nbsp; �Oooh!&nbsp; Not there.�&nbsp; ...Swish...thack.&nbsp; �Eek!&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh-my-god, don&#8217;t whip me there.�&nbsp; ...Swish...thack!&nbsp; �Ow-ow-ow.� ...Swish...thack!&nbsp; �Ahhh!&nbsp; Rafiq, don&#8217;t let her do that.&nbsp; She&#8217;s really hurting me.�

Ivy said, �That&#8217;s what she gets because you pissed me off, Rafiq.�&nbsp; And then she stung me on the pussy yet again.&nbsp; 

After three more lightning bold whip strokes, it felt like she was shredding my pussy lips.&nbsp; I was feeling faint.&nbsp; Would there would be no end?

Finally Rafiq intervened by sheltering my pussy with his hand.&nbsp; As he pressed his chest to my body, Ivy paused and said, �Did you like those?&nbsp; Want more like that?�

I shook my head weakly.&nbsp; �Rafiq, how could you let her do that?�

Ivy said, �He likes the blood dribbling down your legs.�

As I let out a squeal, Rafiq said, �Bullshit.&nbsp; There&#8217;s no blood.&nbsp; That whip can&#8217;t draw blood.�

�Are you sure?�&nbsp; Although I could see no blood, hanging immobilized as I was, I couldn&#8217;t tell.

�Of course I&#8217;m sure.&nbsp; Did it feel that bad?�

�I thought I was going to faint.&nbsp; I&#8217;ve had enough.&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me down.�

�That&#8217;s not for you to decide,� said Ivy.&nbsp; �But I&#8217;ll spare you any more like those.&nbsp; Really.&nbsp; ...Here, does this feel better?�&nbsp; She dropped down and put her mouth to my pussy.&nbsp; Gently she licked.

It was soothing.&nbsp; I murmured my appreciation.&nbsp; And if she was going to take care of me, maybe I didn&#8217;t have to be let down right away.

As she continued the gentle stimulation, the pain ebbed, gradually replaced by arousal.&nbsp; I might be able to come off if she would keep it up.
 
Again I wondered about the possibility of a past life in which I had been hung crux simplex.&nbsp; Had some onlooker given me cunnilingus?&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; To sexually humiliate me?&nbsp; But in that lifetime perhaps I was such a nympho-slut as to be aroused by such humiliation.&nbsp; In the end had they brought me to climax just as I gave up the ghost?&nbsp; What a way to go.

I was undulating my hips with the pleasure of her stimulation.&nbsp; I wanted to hurry up and come off while I could.&nbsp; ...But trying to hurry is a hindrance

Then Ivy&#8217;s tongue retreated.&nbsp; As she rose, she said, �It&#8217;s not time for you to come off yet.&nbsp; We&#8217;re nowhere near done with you.�

She looked me over.&nbsp; Then she touched my cheek.&nbsp; As she passed her fingers over my mouth, she said, �Let it in.�

Letting go of my natural resistance, I let her two fingers enter.&nbsp; Finger fucked in the mouth, that&#8217;s what I thought to myself.&nbsp; I sucked a little.

Then Ivy withdrew her fingers, saying, �But fingers aren&#8217;t as good as the dildo, are they?�&nbsp; She bent and picked up the boat hook pole with the wooden dildo fastened to it.&nbsp; She held it to my mouth.&nbsp; I didn&#8217;t open for it &#8211; after all, it had been in April&#8217;s tunnel a half-hour ago.&nbsp; As I kept my mouth shut, she said, �Should I stuff it dry into your cunt?

I immediately took it into my mouth, trying to make it as wet as possible.&nbsp; As she fucked me in the mouth from afar with the pole-dildo, I felt debased and violated.&nbsp; Why it should make so much difference that the dildo was on a long pole, I&#8217;m not sure.&nbsp; But with Ivy gripping it at shoulder height with both hands, thrusting it at me like a spear, it made her seem so much more powerful.

Meanwhile, beside me Rafiq was playing with my breasts, squeezing and mushing them this way and that.&nbsp; Ivy then thrust the dildo to the back of my throat.

�Hey!� Rafiq rebuked her, and she withdrew the dildo as I gagged and coughed, tears in my eyes.&nbsp; 

�Sorry, my bad,� she said.&nbsp; Next, since there was nowhere near enough height to get a six foot pole up under me, she unfastened the now well slobbered-on dildo from the boat hook and put it to my pussy.&nbsp; �Fuck the bitch,� she said, as she forced it home with a quick thrust.

I gasped.&nbsp; Clearly she was making a point of being rough with it.&nbsp; It made my appreciate how gentle the Skipper had been when he put the dildo to me in the galley.&nbsp; �You bitch,� I said.&nbsp; �You&#8217;re trying to make it hurt.�

�No more than what you deserve,� she replied, dildo-banging me hard in and out. �And it&#8217;s what you like, anyway.�

�Stop.&nbsp; You&#8217;re hurting me, you fucking bitch.�

At this point Rafiq stayed her rough in and out motion.&nbsp; Ivy let go of the dildo and countered&nbsp; �If you call me a bitch again, I&#8217;ll whip your little tits till you faint.&nbsp; I&#8217;ll shred them.�

�You will not.&nbsp; Rafiq won&#8217;t let you.�

�Woo.&nbsp; Rafiq, the higher authority.&nbsp; Only trouble is, Rafiq&#8217;s loves to see your tits whipped.�

�Whipped yes, shredded no,� said Rafiq.&nbsp; He was clearly getting disturbed by Ivy.

�Jenny likes excitement.&nbsp; Tit whipping: been there, done that.&nbsp; Instead she wonders if she&#8217;s brave enough to present her breasts for a shredding.�

�You&#8217;re fucking crazy,� I said.&nbsp; �Go shred your own tits.&nbsp; Try the cheese grater.�

�Now there&#8217;s an idea for what we can do with your tits,� she replied.

�I&#8217;ve heard enough,� said Rafiq.&nbsp; �You&#8217;re like out of control.�

�Don&#8217;t get all hyper.&nbsp; I&#8217;m just trying to figure out Jenny&#8217;s limits.&nbsp; And it looks like she&#8217;s a lot more tame than she&#8217;s tried to make us believe.�

�I never tried to make anyone believe that my limits were anything but ordinary.&nbsp; I never asked to be hung on the mast.&nbsp; I&#8217;d be happy if you let me down.�

This conversation was interrupted by April, who having just come forward, said, �Believe it or not, the Argo&#8217;s foremost pervert is getting bent out of shape about what&#8217;s going on up here.&nbsp; You guys are attracting attention, and the Skipper thinks the dildo fucking is over the top.�

I glanced around; there were three other boats nearby.&nbsp; Before shaking my hair in front of my face to obscure myself, I caught a glimpse of someone with binoculars.&nbsp; Why had I let myself get into this situation?

�Anyway,� continued April.&nbsp; �He wants Jenny to cover up with this towel.�

What a relief.&nbsp; To be decently covered.&nbsp; And Ivy would only be able to whip my legs.&nbsp; No sweat.

Then I saw the towel April had brought.&nbsp; �Only a hand towel?� I said.&nbsp; �That&#8217;s not big enough.�

�It can work like a little skirt, even though it won&#8217;t go all the way around,� she replied.&nbsp; �We&#8217;ll use this piece of rope as a belt to hold it in place.�&nbsp; 

April then put the rope around my hips as a belt and tucked the towel under it, covering my loins.&nbsp; That it didn&#8217;t cover my butt was not really an issue, hung against the mast as I was.&nbsp; Meanwhile, gravity having pulled the dildo inexorably downward, I gave a pelvic push and expelled it from my vagina.&nbsp; It hit the deck with a clunk.

�What about my top?�

�Oh, but you&#8217;re cute topless,� April replied.&nbsp; She put her hands to my breasts.&nbsp; Her fingers rubbed circles around my nipples.&nbsp; Then she put her mouth to my breast and started sucking.&nbsp; Her fingers probed my clit and started frigging.

Yet another person sexually stimulating me.&nbsp; Right out in public view.&nbsp; And again I was responding to it with arousal.&nbsp; Hadn&#8217;t I already decided that I wanted down off this mast.&nbsp; But now I was ready for more.&nbsp; What kind of slut was I?

Well, maybe I wasn&#8217;t really a slut.&nbsp; After all, they hung me here.&nbsp; I didn&#8217;t seek this out.&nbsp; They set me up to work their perversions on my vulnerabilities.&nbsp; I can&#8217;t help it that I respond sexually.&nbsp; Why should I blame myself?

I didn&#8217;t expect April to continue stimulating me for long enough for me to get anywhere with it.&nbsp; And she didn&#8217;t.&nbsp; She unlatched from my breast and put her lips to mine.&nbsp; We kissed briefly.&nbsp; Then she pulled away and after glancing around at the nearby boats, said, �If your mistress will allow you to cover your breasts, I&#8217;ll get something for you.�

Ivy said, �A punishment bra is what Jenny would wear.&nbsp; Some barbed wire wrapped round and round her chest.&nbsp; Real tight.�

�Fortunately for me, there&#8217;s no barbed wire on board.�&nbsp; My vision of a past-life crux simplex experience reentered my mind.&nbsp; Had I been forced to wear a bra of thorns?&nbsp; Oh-my-god, I wonder what that felt like.&nbsp; ...Stimulation mixed with discomfort?&nbsp; Real painful?&nbsp; Total agony?&nbsp; ...How tightly did they put it on?&nbsp; Would the thorns just sort of scratch my nipples?&nbsp; Or would they stick deep in?

�No time for punishment bras,� said Ivy.&nbsp; �Cuz I&#8217;m just going to whip your front like you&#8217;ve never been whipped before.�

Swish...thack.&nbsp; Ivy laid the whip across my torso just below the belly button.&nbsp; Then another, higher.&nbsp; And another.&nbsp; Swish...thack.&nbsp; Swish...thack.&nbsp; Swish...thack!&nbsp; One stroke after another, a steady rhythm lashing me across the belly and ribs.&nbsp; She was making a point of snapping it on me hard.&nbsp; The sting was fierce.

Gasping and panting with pain, I was determined to take it bravely.&nbsp; So far, despite her threats, she had spared my breasts.&nbsp; All I could do is hope for the best.

Swish...thack!&nbsp; Swish...thack!&nbsp; Swish...thack!&nbsp; Hard stinging whip strokes.&nbsp; Across the ribs.&nbsp; Then finally across the base of the breasts.&nbsp; I knew she was about to give it to me on the nipples.

A speed boat pulled up beside us and slowed down to our speed.&nbsp; As it followed along side of us, I knew several guys there were checking us out.&nbsp; My hair obscured my face, but still, they were making me uptight.&nbsp; Couldn&#8217;t they just go away?&nbsp; It&#8217;s one thing for people to check you out from afar, but another thing to move in close so they can really gape at you.

Then Ivy stopped whipping me, and turned to watch them.&nbsp; I also looked over.&nbsp; ...What!&nbsp; ...Two guys were up on the bow, stark naked.&nbsp; Each was bound to the other by the left ankle.&nbsp; ...And they were swatting each other with belts.&nbsp; And two other guys in the stern were cheering them on.

The two in the bow were really going at it.&nbsp; Trading hard swats, all thick and fast.&nbsp; They were having a great time. They both had erections.

Now it was obvious that they hadn&#8217;t brought their boat in close to ogle me.&nbsp; It seemed that they just wanted to share in the crazy energy ...and fuel it.&nbsp; With all their whooping, theirs was more of a show.

The one guy grabbed the other guy&#8217;s penis and was yanking on it.&nbsp; Unable to break his grip, the other guy started swatting him in the crotch with his belt.&nbsp; Lurching to avoid the blows, he fell over the side.&nbsp; Pulled in by the penis, and connected by the ankle, the other guy went over the side with him and they entered the water with a double splash.

After more hollering as the two in the water were left behind, the guys in stern finally cut their engine.&nbsp; The two guys in the water apparently in no trouble, the two in the stern then went at it trying to throw each other over the bulkhead into water.&nbsp; But with me hung on the mast facing forward, they were all quickly out of my field of vision as we left them behind.

Continuing to look back at the action, Rafiq said to Ivy, �Maybe we&#8217;re not so deviant after all.&nbsp; We seem to fit right in.�

�Compared to them, we&#8217;re inconspicuous,� Ivy replied.&nbsp; Then turning to me, she lifted my little towel-skirt and flicked her finger across my clit, saying, �I don&#8217;t see why a slut like you should be allowed any clothes when you&#8217;re being punished.�

�I&#8217;m not a slut.&nbsp; But you are a bitch,� I said in a light tone.

�Insolent brat.&nbsp; I&#8217;m the one holding the whip.�

�Well woot-woot.�

She let go of my towel-skirt and stepped back taking her measure with the whip.&nbsp; Swish...thack.&nbsp; She snapped it hard across the upper part my breasts.&nbsp; I tried not to react.&nbsp; Swish...thack!&nbsp; A lightning strike right across the nipples.&nbsp; I held back a cry, but I couldn&#8217;t help panting.

Swish...thack.&nbsp; Across the base of my breasts.&nbsp; Swish...thack!&nbsp; �Ooh!�&nbsp; Again to the nipples, so hard.&nbsp; As she laid another and another so hard to my breasts, in desperation I looked to Rafiq.&nbsp; I needed his energy to sustain me.

He responded by touched my cheek.&nbsp; ...And then brought his lips to mine!&nbsp; ...Swish...thack!&nbsp; Ivy laid another stinging whip stroke straight onto the nipples.&nbsp; ...Rafiq pressed his lips more tightly to mine.

Such a vivid contrast of sensations.&nbsp; The trenchant bite of Ivy&#8217;s whip, lashing my breasts.&nbsp; The soothing moistness of Rafiq&#8217;s lips, smooching with mine.&nbsp; Eyes closed, I was experiencing a hyper reality.

With his lips still pressed to mine, he swung my body a little away from the mast.&nbsp; Suspended, I had been only resting against it, not bound against it.&nbsp; Having made space behind me, his lips separated from mine and he slipped around my ankle rope, placing himself between me and the mast.&nbsp; Now he was hugging me from behind.

Swish...thack!&nbsp; Swish...thack!&nbsp; Swish...thack!&nbsp; With savage intensity, Ivy laid that fiery sting on my front, one hard stroke after another.&nbsp; She snapped it across every part of my breasts ...above, below, but especially straight onto on the nipples.

Rafiq&#8217;s penis was no longer just a bulge inside his pants.&nbsp; I could feel it bared on my butt and then between my legs.&nbsp; One hand clasped to my hip, his other hand was guiding his penis toward my tunnel.&nbsp; He was going to fuck me while I hung on the mast.

The shaft found my opening and thrust its way in.&nbsp; Sliding up and up.&nbsp; All the way home.&nbsp; He had me.&nbsp; He was holding me tightly by the hips.&nbsp; One hand slid toward my crotch.&nbsp; His finger pressed onto my clit, impelling my arousal.

Here I was hung on the mast, Ivy laying one scorching whip stroke after another to my front, Rafiq fucking me from behind.&nbsp; This was the furthest antithesis from the missionary position.&nbsp; Not snuggled recumbent between cozy mattress and warm overcovering body.&nbsp; No, here I was suspended upright, outstretched naked to all the world, my unprotected front flayed with cruel scathing strokes.

Was I reliving the climax of a past life?&nbsp; Was this crux simplex thing more than just a fantasy?&nbsp; Had I been a rebellious slave girl in the time of Spartacus?&nbsp; Captured, then stripped and bound, had I been led through crowds of gaping, clamorous villagers, who groped and humiliated me as I stumbled past them?

Unworthy of being nailed to the heavy trunk of a mature tree, had they hung me to the narrow trunk of a young tree, no older than myself?&nbsp; Had the crowd cheered as they stretched my wrists overhead and drove the nail through?&nbsp; Was that my moment of celebrity, in an otherwise humble series of lifetimes?

Had the crowd then worked their sexual perversions on my exposed body?&nbsp; Tweaking, rubbing, prodding, pinching, and poking at my private areas.

To the cheers of the crowd, had my former mistress taken up a charioteer&#8217;s leather horsewhip and flayed my outstretched front?&nbsp;&nbsp; As the ultimate indignity, as she continued scourging my flesh, had a Roman soldier slid between me and the tree trunk and impaled me with his penis up my vagina?

Whipped and fucked to the death, hung on a tree.&nbsp; If there are indeed such things as past lives &#8211; and I don&#8217;t know if there are &#8211; such a cataclysmic end might then brand itself into the psyche to be relived in different ways lifetime after lifetime.

Swish-thack!&nbsp; �Owww!�&nbsp;&nbsp; ...Swish...thack!&nbsp; �Oooh!�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ...Swish-thack!&nbsp; �Ahhhh!�&nbsp; One scorching whip stroke after another.&nbsp; Most of them aimed at the softness of my breasts.&nbsp; So many smacking straight onto the sensitive nipples.&nbsp; My breasts were sizzling.&nbsp; My nipples were glowing like red-hot coals.

And at the same time, my cunt was tensed by the thrusting organic shaft, my clit galvanized by frenetic frigging fingers.

An incandescent sexual plasma fluxed through me.&nbsp; My state of arousal was approaching the brink.&nbsp; All the while, with eyes closed I imagined a fateful day two millennia ago, hung on a tree.&nbsp; Impelled toward a climactic end, a full participant in the frenzy of lust. ...A descent into the pit of ruinous carnality.&nbsp; ...Or an ascent to the pinnacle of ecstatic sacrificial fulfillment.

Was there really any difference between Ivy&#8217;s scathing, girl-flesh shaking whip strokes and Rafiq&#8217;s fluid, cunt-propelling thrusts or clit-quivering manipulation.&nbsp; Pain or pleasure, it was the impetus I craved.&nbsp; Sexual energy pouring in.&nbsp; I just wanted more.

Like a massive star consuming everything in its gravity, I absorbed every element of each whip stroke that Ivy laid on me &#8211; the hiss of the thong as it cleaved the air; the abrupt clap and explosive pain as it whacked bare flesh; the ensuing stinging aftermath.&nbsp; Every detail of Rafiq&#8217;s rhythmic thrusting&nbsp; &#8211; his loins pressing on my butt, his shaft impelling my vagina.&nbsp; And all the quivering stimulation of his fingers ceaselessly frigging my clit.

To the signal of his breath heaving behind my ear, Rafiq began pumping cum.&nbsp; I could feel the palpitations as he cast his life oils up my vaginal canal.

My own arousal had reached critical.&nbsp; No matter that I wanted more, I could hold no more.&nbsp; The throes of orgasmic climax rocked my core.&nbsp; Seized by its uncontrollable force I gasped and quivered.&nbsp; Eyes squinched shut, I held my breath. ...Eyes wide open, I panted for air.

Oh-my-god.&nbsp; Eyes open, I now saw that we had sailed well beyond the marina and gone all the way into Baltimore&#8217;s Inner Harbor.&nbsp; There was the National Aquarium building, and the WWII submarine and the Constellation tall sailing ship moored in their places.&nbsp; The downtown Baltimore waterfront, people everywhere.

Suspended helpless on an upright, whipped and fucked until brought to climax, all facing a crowd of onlookers.&nbsp; Not just a past-life crux simplex fantasy, it was happening right before me. ...But what cared I about onlookers.&nbsp; I was in the throes of a detonating galactic supernova.

Gathering momentum, the orgasmic shock wave traveled outward from the epicenter in my nether region.&nbsp; Up my torso, down my thighs, bounding outward to my extremities.&nbsp; Then plunging back to the center, converging into a singularity of immeasurable heat and density before exploding outward afresh.

Cycle after cycle, transformation after transformation.&nbsp; Birth following death, creation following destruction.&nbsp; Ten thousand lifetimes of pain and pleasure.&nbsp; Ten thousand cycles of samsara ever seeking nirvana.&nbsp; Ten thousand life stories, told by ten thousand imbeciles.

Stupefied by seizures of rapture ebbing and flowing, expanding, contracting, I was no longer of time and place.&nbsp; Uncoupled from the bounds, I journeyed ever backward, experiencing the pain and pleasure of a hundred million forebears, all the way to the dawn of life in a warm nurturing sea.&nbsp; All the way back and then forward again, a pulsating cadence of existence after existence.

Driven ever deeper into the throbbing rhythm of orgasmic climax, I had thrown myself over to sensual ecstacy as if never to return to the realm of sanity.&nbsp; A maniac gorging on every loving, scathing, stirring, or rousing tactile sensation my body was capable of experiencing.

The pounding din of clashing stimuli was rocking my core to the edge of disintegration when Ivy finally laid off the whip.&nbsp; Although my breasts were still stinging like fury, at least I could focus on being locked together with Rafiq.&nbsp; Having disgorged his potencies into me, the forcefulness of his rhythmic thrusting began to ease.

The momentum of my own tumultuous climax carried far onward until, nearly spent of energy, it too gradually quieted into receding sets of gently lapping waves.&nbsp; Rafiq wrapped his arms around my front, cradling my sting-tingling breasts.&nbsp; Below, we remained coupled.&nbsp; Sharing an experience like this, I could not imagine that our spirits would not remain forever joined whatever individual paths we might take.

Having turned about from the Inner Harbor, we were now headed for the marina.&nbsp; This odyssey would conclude shortly.

Serene in the amber afterglow of the embers of my orgasmic supernova, I reflected where I had been.&nbsp; Was I the same person that I had been two weeks ago before I came upon the Argo?&nbsp; Was I the same person I had been two hours ago before they hung me on the mast?&nbsp; If we are what we think and feel, those thoughts and feelings change from moment to moment... a moment always fresh for discovery.


&#8211; Epilogue &#8211;

After the voyage, Rafiq and Ivy broke up.&nbsp; I got together with him a couple times during August but I could sense that our magic had slipped away.&nbsp; April told me that he had started going with a girl attached to the Russian embassy.

Just before I left for college, by chance I ran into Rafiq and his new girl friend at a trance-music dance club in DC.&nbsp; I had gone there with a friend, Elwood.&nbsp; Since Elwood is openly and exclusively gay, that may seem strange.&nbsp; But it actually makes sense since all either of us wanted was a friendly partner who liked to dance.&nbsp; After all the sexual intensity of the voyage, I wanted to cool it, and I knew he wanted nothing from me sexually.

But encountering Rafiq there was not that good.&nbsp; The driving trace rhythm made it hard to converse.&nbsp; And Elwood&#8217;s manner was sufficiently effeminate that Rafiq was eyeing him as though he couldn&#8217;t figure out why he was with me.

For my part I had little interest in getting to know Rafiq&#8217;s new girl friend.&nbsp; Anyway, after that chance encounter, the club is big enough that we did not run into them again for the rest of the evening.&nbsp; Shortly after that I left for college and did not see Rafiq again.

The Skipper, on the other hand, I saw later that year at April&#8217;s house.&nbsp; It was during the holiday season after the semester ended.&nbsp; April&#8217;s parents were having a big get together of relatives.&nbsp; April told me that the Skipper had asked that I be invited.

He was clearly delighted to see me there.&nbsp; He seemed to be doing well and made a point of telling me that he had been finding more work &#8211; as an independent consultant &#8211; and drinking less.&nbsp; He attributed that to what he thought was the good influence of his encounters with me.&nbsp; I sensed that he was sincere in his regard for me, but I was uneasy with the implied responsibility.

He tried to get me to go upstairs with him to April&#8217;s bedroom.&nbsp; I politely declined, but quietly teased him with the image of everyone ceasing their noisy conversations while they listened to sounds emanating from the bedroom ...the sound of him whacking me with April&#8217;s hairbrush while I yelped with every stroke.&nbsp; That seemed to make him more insistent.&nbsp; But still I declined any closed-door encounter with him.

At the end of evening he offered to drive me home.&nbsp; As it was a thirty-minute walk which I had already done one-way to get to April&#8217;s, I accepted the ride.&nbsp; On the way, he said he thought I was brave to get in the car with him since he might kidnap me, take me to his secret hideout, and enslave me.

Laughing, I teased him about having delusions of powerfulness.&nbsp; When I asked him how he imagined he could pull such a thing off, he started in on how he would do it.&nbsp; Soon arriving in front of my house, we parked and I listened and interacted with him for another forty-five minutes as he unfolded a long tale of my imagined enslavement &#8211; what he would do and how I would respond.&nbsp; But that&#8217;s another story.

&#8211; End &#8211;
