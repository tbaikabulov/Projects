Synopsis: 






Stockholm Syndrome

The bell at Jamestown High rang, announcing the end of the schoolday and, as most students were thankful for, the end of the week as well.&nbsp; Blaire, on the other hand, found herself walking out into the bright afternoon sun with a sense of dread.&nbsp; It was that same sense of dread that filled her each time she had to make her way home.&nbsp; The little redheaded freshman was never exactly a fan of going home.&nbsp; It wasn&#8217;t that she lived in an abusive home (though perhaps some psychologists would disagree).&nbsp; Her father was a major player in the city mayor&#8217;s office and her mother was just as high up in one of the most notorious law firms.&nbsp; She never saw her parents, and when she did they didn&#8217;t really tend to her like a parent should.

However, it wasn&#8217;t as if school was much more forgiving to her.&nbsp; She went to the top school in the city, so she was surrounded by girls just like her &#8211; at least in the sense that everyone had rich parents.&nbsp; Most of them grew up to be huge bitches in response to their own lack of love while Blaire took the other road and became quite reclusive.&nbsp; It didn&#8217;t help that she was tinier than most everyone else her age, barely clearing 4&#8217; 9�.&nbsp; She hadn&#8217;t developed terribly large breasts, and in fact her whole body was rather tight.&nbsp; While she thanked her lucky stars that the other girls tended to turn their anger on each other than bothering with a little mouse like her, it just added to the loneliness.

Even with all the money available to her, she could never find the time, energy, or inventiveness to find clothes that really suited her.&nbsp; So much of her beauty was currently hidden in a plain sweater and somewhat baggy jeans.&nbsp; Her feet were in ratty skate shoes that she&#8217;d drawn all over in her free time.&nbsp; Her mother, while not vocal about much, always seemed to have a kind of antagonistic relationship with these shoes.

All this and more she mulled over in her head as she made her way, slow as possible, down the sidewalk towards her home.&nbsp; Her blue eyes shone bright in the sunlight, but still betrayed the way her mind was far away.

And this was exactly what Jessica hoped to see as she watched the girl&#8217;s approach for what felt like the millionth time.&nbsp; But today was different.&nbsp; Today was the last day she would watch from afar.&nbsp; Soon, very soon now, she would not just be watching Blaire, she&#8217;d have her in her clutches, ready to take her home and mold her to her own devices.&nbsp; She took a deep breath and shook off the excitement.&nbsp; She had to get the girl before she could follow through with her further plans.

Jessica had spent months studying her prey, ever since the first day she saw her.&nbsp; She&#8217;d photographed her, then used that to figure out who she was.&nbsp; She studied everything she could about the girl.&nbsp; Knowing who her parents were, the first plan was simply to kidnap her then collect a pretty little ransom in exchange for her return.&nbsp; But the more she studied her, the more she felt that this just wasn&#8217;t enough.

Jessica cut a picture that was the exact opposite of Blaire.&nbsp; She was tall and, though lean, well endowed in the hips and chest.&nbsp; She had long blonde hair and dull green eyes.&nbsp; But her look was always one of confidence, of knowing that even if she didn&#8217;t have the upper hand, she only had to pretend she did to still come out on top.&nbsp; And today, she was most certainly going to do just that.&nbsp; She parked her van inside an alleyway she knew Blaire used as a shortcut, outfitted with rings drilled into strategic locations.

Time was closing in on her and she stopped daydreaming and finished getting ready.&nbsp; She slipped a mask over her face, a kind of plain theatrical mask, that kept her face covered but left her beautiful hair free flowing down her back.&nbsp; She&#8217;d dressed the rest of her body in all black &#8211; a tight-fitting hoodie, black jeans, and thick soled boots.&nbsp; She held a gun in one gloved hand, the other ready to clamp itself over the girl&#8217;s mouth as soon as she came into range.

In fact, Blaire was still so distracted by her thoughts as she turned into the alleyway that she didn&#8217;t even realize there were arms wrapping around her until Jessica actually spoke up.&nbsp; The older woman gently placed the gun into the center of the girl&#8217;s back up against her spine while the other clamped over her mouth.&nbsp; �Listen to me very carefully, little lady.&nbsp; We&#8217;re going to walk up to that van and get in the back.&nbsp; You&#8217;re going to do everything I tell you or I will shoot you dead.&nbsp; Am I clear?�

Despite being �raised� by wealthy folks, Blaire had never been taught anything about what to do in these situations.&nbsp; So she simply let self-preservation kick in and nodded her head with a muffled whimper.

�Good, let&#8217;s go then.�&nbsp; She steadily walked the girl forward and directed her, or rather pushed her roughly, into the back, keeping the gun constantly trained on her.&nbsp; Then she climbed in behind her and shut the doors, constantly making sure the gun was pointed directly at her pretty little head.&nbsp; �Hands together over your head, you&#8217;ll notice a little ring in the roof there��&nbsp; Again, as if in a dream, Blaire did exactly as she was told and lifted her hands together above her head, just below the metal d-ring above her head.&nbsp; Seeing the girl was a little too out of it to bother trying anything, Jessica took up rope in her free hand and set the gun aside before quickly wrapping the rope around her wrists to keep them secured together before looping it into the tiny ring and securing it in place with a tight knot.

Next, she took a leather band with two pads and wrapped it around the girl&#8217;s eyes and buckled it behind her head to blindfold her.&nbsp; A ballgag was next, buckled around her head in the same way.&nbsp; Finally she tied her feet together and ran that rope through another ring in the floor.&nbsp; Once she was positive the girl was secured, she decided it was time to take advantage of the situation, just for a moment.&nbsp; She slipped off her gloves and ran her hands up and down the girl&#8217;s sides, slowly edging them under her sweater and up to her chest.&nbsp; Blaire finally tried to protest, but the gag made this difficult, and a quick nudge with the gun (finding itself back in Jessica&#8217;s hand quickly) shut her up fast.&nbsp; The girl&#8217;s captor kept one hand up her sweater while the other reminded her why she should be a good girl.&nbsp; �Don&#8217;t forget about our friend down here�&nbsp; I don&#8217;t think he&#8217;d like it if you tried anything funny like� I don&#8217;t know, alerting anyone passing by.�&nbsp; She thought about diving into those jeans as well, but she didn&#8217;t feel out of the woods yet.&nbsp; So she gave her one more meaningful wave of the gun before climbing into the driver&#8217;s seat and heading out of the city.

&#8216;&#8217;&#8217;&#8217;&#8217;&#8217;&#8217;&#8217;&#8217;&#8217;&#8217;&#8217;&#8217;&#8217;&#8217;&#8217;&#8217;&#8217;&#8217;&#8217;&#8217;&#8217;&#8217;&#8217;

It was a rough drive that lasted for almost twenty minutes.&nbsp; Jessica hated the drive enough, so she could only imagine what hell it was on Blaire.&nbsp; The 15-year-old was in pain already.&nbsp; Her arms were getting sore from hanging over top of her head, her jaw was sore from holding the gag in place, and her knees were killing her from sitting like that for so long.&nbsp; She would give a soft moan or groan every minute or so, but to Jessica this was far from annoying &#8211; it was music to her ears!&nbsp; She could listen to that all day &#8211; and in fact, intended to do just that.

But eventually the ride came to an end.&nbsp; Getting the girl out actually proved to be even more difficult than getting her in.&nbsp; Jessica didn&#8217;t like the idea of giving her too much freedom.&nbsp; She even thought about making her walk blindfolded but that would have just made things worse.&nbsp; After another five minutes of untying and retying ropes she&#8217;d gotten the girl out of the van.&nbsp; The rope around her wrists stayed in place and was now being used as a kind of leash or guide.&nbsp; The rope around her ankles had been slacked some to allow her to walk, or rather hobble.&nbsp; The gag also stayed in place, but the blindfold was eventually discarded.

Blaire emerged from the van, after an awkward moment or two, to find herself in a foreign location.&nbsp; She didn&#8217;t get out of the city much, and this was most definitely not one of the places she was used to going.&nbsp; As far as she was concerned, this could be states away.&nbsp; They were in the middle of the country, not a road in sight except for a driveway leading up to a large manor house obviously belonging to her captor.&nbsp; All around was nothing but trees, a grove of them out about a quarter-mile or so.&nbsp; She couldn&#8217;t see any other houses either.&nbsp; There was no escape, and she was alone except for this insane woman who&#8217;d taken her.

Jessica allowed Blaire this time to look around for expressly this reason.&nbsp; It gave her a moment to understand that it was impossible to figure out where she was, and even more impossible to get away easily.&nbsp; When it seemed like the girl had taken long enough to take it all in, she tugged the rope, which was met with a somewhat agitated grunt before Blaire followed after her.

The bound teenager had to admit that she had certainly been taken to a nice house &#8211; and she knew nice houses.&nbsp; Despite never living in it, her parents had put a lot of money into their domicile.&nbsp; This place wasn&#8217;t quite as� �hoity-toity�, but it had most certainly still cost a pretty penny.&nbsp; Again, she was give a little bit of time to admire the hardwood floors and well-made architecture before being dragged along again.&nbsp; She eventually managed to get into the rhythm of walking with the hobbling rope just in time to realize that Jessica wanted her to walk down a flight of steps.&nbsp; She looked at her with a pathetic whimper, to which the blonde just gave her a half-hearted shrug.

It took a while, and even more learning, but to her oddly-placed pride Blaire actually managed to reach the bottom of the stairs.&nbsp; But her excitement was short-lived.&nbsp; Jessica flipped on the lights and the girl was met with a horrid sight.&nbsp; If she knew about bondage and BDSM and that kind of lifestyle, she&#8217;d know that she&#8217;d just arrived in the middle of a prime example of a dungeon.&nbsp; Instead, she only knew that she was in a basement decorated to look like an updated medieval torture chamber.&nbsp; Jessica had obviously been planning all this out, because she gave the girl just enough time to adjust to this before leading her to a mattress laying on the floor with a single ratty pillow. 

�Welcome to home, sweet home, Blaire.&nbsp; Yes, I know your name, and there will be plenty of time to play 20 questions later.&nbsp; I&#8217;ve got some things to do, so I&#8217;m going to leave you here to take a nap after such an exhausting afternoon.&nbsp; But first��&nbsp; She went over to the wall and grabbed a dog collar that was hanging there, connected to a d-ring in the wall by a thin chain.&nbsp; She connected this around Blaire&#8217;s neck, careful to avoid her hair.&nbsp; Sure that the girl was securely in place and still bound, she clicked a small luggage padlock into place on the collar and left, shutting off the lights and heading upstairs.&nbsp; After the door closed, Blaire was left alone in the dark to think about just what was to be her fate.&nbsp; It didn&#8217;t take long for her to break down into tears, then collapse on her pillow and eventually pass out.

&#8216;&#8217;&#8217;&#8217;&#8217;&#8217;&#8217;&#8217;&#8217;&#8217;&#8217;&#8217;&#8217;&#8217;&#8217;&#8217;&#8217;&#8217;&#8217;&#8217;&#8217;&#8217;&#8217;&#8217;

Jessica had to admit as she finished up that she was surprised little Blaire hadn&#8217;t woken up yet.&nbsp; She&#8217;d been doing quite a lot with the unconscious girl and she hadn&#8217;t so much as stirred once.

What she hadn&#8217;t yet pointed out to Blaire before leaving her in the dark was a number of cameras she&#8217;d installed in the dungeon.&nbsp; These were to serve multiple purposes.&nbsp; She could watch her captive beauty when not in the dungeon herself on a live feed.&nbsp; She could also set it to record any session she had with the girl, then make a little extra bank on it &#8211; or just make her watch it later for some extra embarrassment.

She&#8217;d watched her cry and had actually relished in it some.&nbsp; As soon as Blaire was unconscious she hurried downstairs and got to work.&nbsp; One of the things she&#8217;d done that, she had to admit, had even creeped her out, was to buy clothing she knew fit Blaire.&nbsp; She knew this because part of her research had included finding the girl&#8217;s exact sizes from stores she&#8217;d been to and judging from the information she had at hand.&nbsp; She untied and stripped her and redressed her in a black corseted top that covered her small breasts in cups.&nbsp; She then put her into a pair of matching panties.&nbsp; She put fishnet hose on her legs and fishnet gloves on her hands.&nbsp; On her feet she added six-inch heels, which she intended to make her wear often.&nbsp; She left the current collar on her, detaching it from the wall.&nbsp; She carried her light body over to a St. Andrew&#8217;s cross and chained her to it.&nbsp; After a final thought, she slipped a small vibrator into her, one that used a remote control, and removed the gag.&nbsp; All this done, she left again.

She went back upstairs and began preparing some food for the girl when she awoke.&nbsp; It was nothing special, just sweetened oatmeal and water, but it would be enough for the time being.&nbsp; And even this was part of the plan in a small way.&nbsp; Then she returned to watch her CCTV and waited for the girl to awaken.&nbsp; When it seemed to be taking too long, she turned up the remote vibrator a little bit and watched eagerly as her form began to squirm a little until finally she seemed to awaken.&nbsp; She watched as Blaire realized her positioning, clothing, and bondage had changed since she fell asleep and enjoyed, beyond reason, watching this cross her face.

Knowing that her prisoner was awake, she took a little more time to get changed as well.&nbsp; Part of her wanted to ease the girl into things, but she had long since quieted that voice.&nbsp; She instead went full-throttle and changed into a full-body catsuit with stiletto heels.&nbsp; She tied her hair back into a serious ponytail and made sure to get her make-up a little more severe looking as well, focusing on darkening the eyes.

All this finally taken care of, she was ready to meet her future pet.

&#8216;&#8217;&#8217;&#8217;&#8217;&#8217;&#8217;&#8217;&#8217;&#8217;&#8217;&#8217;&#8217;&#8217;&#8217;&#8217;&#8217;&#8217;&#8217;&#8217;&#8217;&#8217;&#8217;&#8217;

Blaire continued to cry softly when she suddenly saw light through her teary eyes.&nbsp; She could hear footsteps, loud, coming down stairs, and then suddenly the room was flooded with light &#8211; and she saw all those terrible devices again.&nbsp; She looked down and realized just how insane her new outfit was.&nbsp; It was only when her gaze rose back up that she knew she was in true trouble.

�P-Please, my father and mother, they can� pay you� L-Let me go!�
�Ohhh, you sweet little thing�&nbsp; I&#8217;ve already thought about that, and it just doesn&#8217;t interest me.&nbsp; You&#8217;ve seen this house; you know I don&#8217;t need it��

Blaire, destitute, lowered her head and sighed softly.&nbsp; Despite how obvious it was (though perhaps not to her), she asked, �Then� wh-what do you want?�
�You really are adorable, you know that?&nbsp; All this and still you don&#8217;t understand�&nbsp; Even the vibrator inside your folds didn&#8217;t tip you off?�&nbsp; To prove her point, Jessica approached the girl and gently rubbed her pussy through her panties, turning up the remote again before turning the thing off.&nbsp; �So young and innocent�&nbsp; I&#8217;m going to have fun breaking that.&nbsp; You, little darling, are going to become my pet, my plaything, my sex slave.�

That was all Blaire needed to hear before breaking into tears all over again.&nbsp; Though Jessica enjoyed this well enough, she didn&#8217;t feel it was time for that at the moment.&nbsp; She cooed softly and stroked the girl&#8217;s hair.&nbsp; �Shhh, don&#8217;t�&nbsp; You&#8217;ll have to look on the bright side, you understand?&nbsp; No more responsibility, no more schoolwork, no more nagging parents, no more annoying school whores��
�How did you kno-�?�

Jessica grinned and gently stroked her cheek before taking a step back.&nbsp; �I know a lot about you, Blaire.&nbsp; I spent weeks getting to know all I could about you.&nbsp; Like I said, I know about your mother and father.&nbsp; The first time I thought about� all this�&nbsp; I was intending on kidnapping you for ransom.&nbsp; But upon further research, I found this both boring and unnecessary.&nbsp; Why take more of what I already have when I can grab myself something quite new and interesting!&nbsp; I&#8217;ve had plenty of fun with women who want to be slaves, but what happens when you take someone who doesn&#8217;t necessarily want to be one?&nbsp; Or perhaps, a girl who should be a slave but simply doesn&#8217;t know it yet.�

�How can you say that??&nbsp; Why would I want to be a slave, what makes you think I&#8217;d be any good?�&nbsp; She seemed confused, but already Jessica could see she wasn&#8217;t fighting it, and her curiosity was getting the best of her.

�Women&#8217;s intuition, perhaps.&nbsp; Hard to say, but even if I&#8217;m wrong it&#8217;ll be a lot of fun!&nbsp; And listen, little one, you&#8217;re not going to hate it yourself, if you can just let go of some primitive ideas about right and wrong��
�What do you mean?�
�Well, I&#8217;m sure when I touched you before, right here��&nbsp; To prove her point she reached out again and rubbed her index and middle finger against the girl&#8217;s panties.&nbsp; �Your brain began to scream, &#8216;This isn&#8217;t right!!&nbsp; I&#8217;m too young!&nbsp; We&#8217;re both girls!&nbsp; I&#8217;m chained up!!&#8217;&nbsp; Something like that�?�

Blaire looked away, obviously a little ashamed, though she wasn&#8217;t sure why.&nbsp; After all, that was true, wasn&#8217;t it?&nbsp; This woman was crazy, to want something like this, not her, right??&nbsp; �B-But it is��&nbsp; Her argument sounded weak at best.

�But it feels� so� good� doesn&#8217;t it?�&nbsp; Again, wanting to drive it home, she turned up the control on the vibrator, causing her victim to shut her eyes, her head rolling back and a moan passing through her lips.&nbsp; A moment after this she snapped back to attention, blushing, only to let out another&nbsp; moan.&nbsp; 
�A� a� a little��&nbsp; Blaire bit her bottom lip, a sign she was unsure, uncomfortable, embarrassed, and losing ground quickly.
�And you&#8217;re not asking for it�&nbsp; You&#8217;re not saying &#8216;Oh please, woman I don&#8217;t know (It&#8217;s Jessica, by the by, though you won&#8217;t be using that much), do it again, do it again!&#8217; are you?�

�Well� no��&nbsp; She sniffled softly and shook her head.&nbsp; Perhaps in a clearer mind she&#8217;d realize this logic was totally out of place and incorrect, but she was getting more and more distracted.
�Then doesn&#8217;t that mean I&#8217;m the only one who&#8217;s wrong?&nbsp; And let&#8217;s say I am, but I&#8217;ve got different ideas of right and wrong myself.&nbsp; Then by my standards I&#8217;m perfectly okay�&nbsp; Would you agree?�

Blaire groaned and shut her eyes tight, trying to focus on the conversation.&nbsp; In response, Jessica just turned up the vibrator more, erasing any thoughts she was about to form.&nbsp; �U-U-Um, I� Mmmm~�&nbsp; I guess??�&nbsp; And just as suddenly, the vibrator shut off altogether.&nbsp; Before she could stop it, Blaire let out a heartbreaking moan of frustration as her buildup was taken away.&nbsp; She didn&#8217;t even know what was happening with her body.&nbsp; She always thought of herself as a good girl, and she knew good girls didn&#8217;t touch themselves.&nbsp; But that morality was quickly dying away at this woman&#8217;s skillful touch.

�That&#8217;s what I like to hear�&nbsp; And if you want it to keep feeling good, then you&#8217;ll have to learn to be a good girl.&nbsp; Do you know what I mean when I say a good girl?�&nbsp; Blaire obviously didn&#8217;t, since they&#8217;re definitions seemed to be in complete contrast to one another.&nbsp; 

Finally she shook her head and sighed softly.&nbsp; �I guess not��

Jessica didn&#8217;t seem mad.&nbsp; It almost looked like she had just won another victory.&nbsp; �That&#8217;s alright, that just means you have to learn.&nbsp; The very first thing is that a good girl listens to what she&#8217;s told��

Blaire was visibly panting hard, still yearning for whatever it was that had been happening only a few moments before.&nbsp; But she managed to comprehend this anyways, if only for the sake of being a good girl and getting more of� whatever.&nbsp; �O-Okay��

�And the best of good girls have older women who can show them how to be a good girl by rewarding goodness and punishing badness.&nbsp; Do you know what they&#8217;re called�?�
�N-No�&nbsp; What?�
�A Mistress�&nbsp; So like I said, my name is Jessica, but you don&#8217;t call a lady by her first name anyways, that&#8217;s rude.&nbsp; So I am called��
�Mistress�?�

Jessica couldn&#8217;t have been happier.&nbsp; She&#8217;d managed to get this girl hooked on pleasure in under fifteen minutes!&nbsp; She stroked her hair and kissed her cheek, meeting almost no resistance.&nbsp; She pushed her luck even further and kissed her on the lips.&nbsp; Still nothing!&nbsp; �Good, you&#8217;ve learned the first important thing.&nbsp; I am now your Mistress.&nbsp; And good girls, what do good girls do?�
�Listen to their Mistress��&nbsp; She continued to breath, though not quite as heavily.&nbsp; Finally her body was cooling down, but she was no less exhausted and confused.&nbsp; And it was about to get worse.

�Excellent.&nbsp; And for understanding the first rule, you get a reward.&nbsp; I&#8217;m betting you&#8217;ve never had one of these before��&nbsp; She gently reached down and this time let her hand slip into her panties.&nbsp; She rubbed her pussy lips very tenderly while flicking the switch on the vibrator to the middle power level.&nbsp; Before long Blaire was panting heavily all over again, her tiny chest heaving with excitement at these new sensations.&nbsp; Gently Jessica turned up the power and moved her hand a little harder against her lips, every now and then flicking her clit.&nbsp; It was after seven or eight of these flicks that she finally heard the girl let out one long, low moan.&nbsp; Her tiny body seemed to seize for a while before finally settling down.&nbsp; Unseen by Blaire, who had passed out for the time being, Jessica removed her hand and the vibrator.&nbsp; She cleaned off both with her tongue, set the vibrator aside.

She gave the girl one more kiss on the cheek before heading back to the staircase, turning off the lights, and going back upstairs.
