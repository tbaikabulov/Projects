Introduction
�Brotherhood of speed� �
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;What in the hell did TK mean when he said that?
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mike Conway was confused.&nbsp; He scratched his head and took a seat in the driver&#8217;s meeting room. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Brotherhood of Speed��Mike asked himself out loud again. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Has TK told you?� Scott Dixon asked from behind him.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Sort of�he mentioned it��
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Didn&#8217;t explain it though?�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mike shook his head and turned to face Scott. �What is it?�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Scott leaned in closer. �The Brotherhood of Speed is something that every driver in this series is part of. We look out for each other&#8217;s needs.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Like when we run out of toothpaste?�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Scott chuckled. �No! Like when your wife didn&#8217;t come with you and you need to fuck something.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mike&#8217;s eyes bulged out of his head. �But I&#8217;m not a fucking fag!�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Neither is Helio�you can still be useful though. Cuddling doesn&#8217;t involve sex, providing cover stories while two of us are occupied is helpful too. Rule is that everyone must take part in some way.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�What happens if you don&#8217;t?�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�You don&#8217;t want to find out. Let&#8217;s just say that it&#8217;s quite painful. Only other rules are that you must give to receive; we don&#8217;t believe in tops and bottoms, everyone is versatile and the women are off limits.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Damn, I wanted to fuck Danica so hard she lost the ability to speak,� Dan Wheldon&#8217;s voice chimed out as he took a seat next to Scott.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Scott let out a small laugh. Mike sat dumbfounded. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Dan leaned in towards Mike. �Just be mindful of the &#8216;couples&#8217; we have.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Couples?�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Marco is mine. Do not touch him. Mario Moraes is TK&#8217;s he&#8217;s off limits too. You can be involved with me and TK though, just not our property.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Okay�.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Don&#8217;t worry, it&#8217;s easy to get used to the concept,� Scott finished just as Brian Barnhart entered the room and called the meeting to order. 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mike knocked on the door to Tony&#8217;s trailer. He was a little freaked out by this whole �Brotherhood� deal and needed some more answers.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Tony opened it and smiled at the rookie. �How can I help you.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I just have a few questions��
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Tony moved and motioned for him to enter. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mike sat down on the couch nearest to the door and glanced at Tony. �The brotherhood�how did it all get started?�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Not really sure. When I joined CART in the 90s it was already going on. Probably started in the 80s. No one knows who the founding brothers are though. It&#8217;s kind of a secret. �
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Are people like Jimmy members?�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Not any more. Once a member becomes an owner, or retires, or moves to another league, he is no longer a brother. If someone comes back like Dario has, they are again a brother.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;��This is so weird.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Tony picked up a bottle of water from the table and drank half of it down. �It&#8217;s a pretty easy concept to get used to.� 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�So, what do the owners do? Do they know?�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Former brothers do, but they don&#8217;t ask and we don&#8217;t tell. Other than that, no.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Press?�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�They may have inclinations, but nothing other than that.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Fans?�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Same.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�This is like being one of the fucking Free Masons ��
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�No, we have more fun.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mike glanced in shock at Tony who responded with a smile. �Do you want to have a lesson in fun?�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The rookie bit his lip in thought. �Not yet. But thank you anyway. I will find you when I want to.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Fine, fair enough. But can you cover for Dan and Marco tonight? Start a story that you&#8217;re going out to dinner with them?�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mike nodded apprehensively. �Sure.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Tony escorted the young man to the door and shut it behind him as he left.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�You&#8217;ll make a good bottom some day.�

Chapter One
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ryan paced back and forth in the trailer. He was back. The man that could make him feel weak in the knees. The man that could make him swoon. The one and only Helio Castroneves. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Last year had been awkward. Ryan had professed his feelings for Helio early in the season and things were touch and go for a while. Then the ice melted and they had become good friends despite their brief romantic encounter. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ryan had spent the past several months worrying that Helio&#8212;HIS Helio&#8212;would wind up in jail being Bubba&#8217;s bitch.&nbsp; Finally the trial was over and Helio was back to join the team in Long Beach. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The door to the trailer opened making Ryan jump.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Aye, mate!� Will chimed.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ryan gave a half-hearted smile. �Aye, Will.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Will put his arm around Ryan, �Relax.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ryan leaned on Will. �This is so hard.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I know, just tell him how you feel though�and see what happens, all you can do. You can&#8217;t keep living like this.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ryan glanced at Will. �Thanks.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;One of the team members poked his head in. Mitch? Mike? Marty? What was his name�Ryan couldn&#8217;t remember. �Your teammate is back!�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ryan dashed outside to see Helio mobbed by reporters and team members. Helio pulled Ryan into a big hug.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ryan nearly melted in his arms. It felt so amazing to be held by the Brazilian descendent of Adonis. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Helio whispered into his ear. �Meet me in my hotel room tonight.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He broke the hold on Ryan and pulled away to hug the next person. Ryan stood smiling, dumbfounded. 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The day passed too slowly for Ryan. Minutes seemed like hours. Hours seemed like days. The clock was simply a cruel invention meant to scorn him.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Finally. 8pm. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ryan dashed down the hallway of the hotel&#8217;s ninth floor.&nbsp; He stopped at Helio&#8217;s door and pulled himself together. He was about to knock when Helio came to the door in a silk bathrobe. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Helio��
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Ryan, let me talk. I want you. I&#8217;ve known it since that kiss about a year ago. I want you to be mine.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ryan beemed as he moved to hold Helio. �I thought you&#8217;d never ask.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Helio held Ryan close to him. �We have to keep this secret�no one other than the other guys can know. My parents would disown me.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�No problem.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�..and we have to go slow.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Also not a problem.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Helio pulled away and motioned towards the bed. �Come cuddle with me?�
