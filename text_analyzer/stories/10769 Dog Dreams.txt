Dog Dreams


I must tell you about a dream I had last Saturday night. It was very vivid and �real�, and very horrible. I don&#8217;t always remember my dreams, and I wish I didn&#8217;t remember this one! Somehow, however I don&#8217;t think I will ever forget it. It was SO clear and vivid and I can STILL �see� every detail in my memory. It seemed so REAL! Please be patient with me on this, I feel I really need to �get it all out� and you will understand why you are the only one I can tell. Well anyway, I will tell you about it . . .

It started with me running through a forest. I felt tired and winded and somehow felt I had been running for a long time. I was completely naked, and my wrists were bound tight together in front of me. I was frightened and I heard dogs barking and baying in the distance. I didn&#8217;t know exactly how many, but I could tell it was several. I was so, so tired and dripping with perspiration, but I knew I had to keep running to get away from those dogs. I was crying at the thought of being caught, I was SO afraid of those dogs. I could use my bound arms to push brush and branches out of my path as I ran, but I knew if the dogs ever caught me, I wouldn&#8217;t be able to put up much resistance.

I kept running, my legs growing more and more tired and my breathing in gasps. I was running as hard as I could, but the noise of the dogs was getting closer and closer. I was so exhausted and I knew I was slowing down, and soon the dogs were right behind me. I wanted to look but knew I didn&#8217;t dare. A moment later they were beside me, then all around me, snapping at me, pawing me and jumping on me. My eyes were so filled with tears I couldn&#8217;t see where I was going and I tripped and fell and the dogs were on me. They were all over me, growling, snapping at me, pushing their noses into me, pawing at me. I screamed and screamed as I tried to fight them off. I rolled and kicked at them, but it didn&#8217;t even slow them down. I don&#8217;t know how long it went on, but then I heard whistles and someone was pulling the dogs off of me. I felt a push from someone&#8217;s boot, and I was rolled over onto my back. I looked up into your face and began to plead with you, �Oh please, PLEASE, don&#8217;t let them get me�. You just smiled down at me and said, �you didn&#8217;t do very well, just over 45 minutes, I&#8217;ll have to run you more often to get you in shape�. I was sobbing and continued begging you to keep the dogs away from me and to free me, but you just knelt down beside me and gave me several VERY hard slaps across my face. I stopped begging you and just sobbed hopelessly.

You took a piece of rope and tied my ankles together, then ran it through the ropes binding my wrists and pulled them all together. I saw then that there were several other women with you and you took a sturdy pole and pushed it between my wrists and ankles, then some of the other women lifted the ends of the pole and I was hoisted off the ground. Everyone began to walk through the forest, and I hung from the pole, swaying helplessly as I was carried through the forest. All the time we walked the dogs swarmed around me, growling, snapping, licking and pushing their noses into me. I just hung there and cried. It seemed a long time that I was carried through the forest this way, but finally I was set down on the ground again.

You untied my ankles, but left my wrists tied together, then dragged me over to where a small barrel lay on the ground on its side. Grabbing my hair, you lifted me to my knees and made me crawl over to it until my hips were directly over the barrel, then you pushed me down on it with your foot. You ran a rope through my bound wrists again and I saw a heavy stake in the ground in front of me. You ran the rope around the stake and pulled my arms out in front of me and fastened them to the stake with the rope. At the same time I felt both my ankles being bound again, and then pulled out to the side. Some of your friends must have been pulling my legs apart and staking them down, just as my arms had been staked. By the time I tried to struggle and resist I was immobilized, stretched across the barrel, my arms straight in front of me, my legs spread so wide that I felt the tendons and muscles of my upper thighs stretched uncomfortably. My rear was raised up in the air perfectly exposing my pussy and ass, I was helpless and vulnerable, and I heard the dogs barking and whining nearby. I suddenly realized what was going to happen and I screamed loudly, and tried to blank it out of my mind. You were laughing and your friends were laughing and giggling.

I kept screaming, crying and begging you, �oh no, please, please, PLEASE don&#8217;t . . . oh no, NO, PLEASE�! I heard someone say, �she is a loud one isn&#8217;t she�, and someone else, laughing, said, �you&#8217;d think she didn&#8217;t enjoy this�, and �If she keeps this up she&#8217;ll keep you awake all night�. �Oh no she won&#8217;t�, you said as you knelt in front of me and jerked my head up by my hair. I could see you had a large ring gag with a harness in your hand, and in spite of myself I screamed loudly, �NOOOOO�. You jammed the gag into my open, screaming mouth, strapped it in tight. I tried to keep screaming, but I could produce only noise now, loud enough but no words were possible. I quickly realized I was very short of breath and knew I had to stop screaming and concentrate on breathing. I could feel tears streaming down my face. Before you let my head down you looked into my eyes and said, �Now you belong to my dogs for the next week, day and night�. I knew I couldn&#8217;t beg you not to do this to me, but I could scream and I did, and I sobbed deeply and tried to focus on my breathing. Then you took a rope and ran it through a ring at the top of the gag harness and pulled my head up and back, fastening the end of the rope to the barrel holding my ass in the air. Looking around as best I could I saw fencing in front of and beside me, and I realized I was in the dog run. I heard one of your friends say, �those dogs really WANTED her didn&#8217;t they�, and some of the others expressed the same thoughts. I heard you say I forced myself not to think of �a week, day and night�, just concentrated on breathing. I was so horrified and humiliated I wanted to die, but my body wouldn&#8217;t let me and I kept on struggling.

In response to their comments, you said, �I thought they would . . . I have a friend with a dog bitch in heat and I got a bottle of that bitch&#8217;s urine. I smeared some on her pussy and ass before I let her run, and I still have plenty so I&#8217;ll be able to keep them interested all week. By the end of the week, they&#8217;ll be conditioned to think that SHE is the bitch in heat to them, and they&#8217;ll be after constantly.� Now you rubbed some more around my pussy and ass, and then around my mouth, saying, �might as well give them all 3 holes�.

I heard you say to your friends, �why don&#8217;t we go inside for some wine, and maybe some supper later. Then you said, �let the dogs into the run now, while we spend the rest of the evening inside.� The dogs set up a racket again, whining and howling and I could hear them scratching at the ground to get at me. Someone released them thin and they were on me! I was exhausted, mentally drained, and as resigned as I could be to my fate, but still I continued to sob hopelessly. They were whining, pushing and fighting to get at me, and soon I felt it! I tried to scream again, but it took all my breath and I had to concentrate on just taking breaths. It went on, the dogs pushing each other away and I knew it would go on and on. They raped my pussy and my ass and my mouth over and over, and I could feel their claws digging into my hips as they clasped me tight and pounded into me. I could feel the huge loads of semen gushing and filling me. It dripped from my rear down my spread legs and what I couldn&#8217;t swallow dripped out of my mouth and down my chin and throat. Everyone watched for a while then I heard you say, �well, let&#8217;s go get that wine now�, and I was left to the dogs. I was limp with humiliation, despair and sorrow, but I KNEW that this was what you wanted. This would be my life! It was becoming painful and I knew it would get much worse. I didn&#8217;t know how many dogs were penned up with me, but they never stopped attacking me as I sobbed silently.

At this point I awoke, and I WAS perspiring, panting hard and exhausted as if I had really been running through a forest. I was still frightened and it took me a few minutes to really �come out of it� and I gasped for breath and could feel my heart pounding. As I slowly realized where I was I saw that I was not only soaked with perspiration but I had kicked off the sheet. I put my hand against my chest to try to calm my racing heartbeat, I brushed against my breast and realized with a shock that my nipple was as hard as a rock. I don&#8217;t know why, but I put my hand down between my legs, perhaps to verify that nothing had REALLY happened to me. I was shocked to realize that my pussy lips were swollen and I was soaking wet. I pulled my hand up and it touched my clit, lightly and only for a second, but I had a massive orgasm. It usually takes a bit of �work� for me to orgasm, and I certainly had NEVER done it with one touch no matter HOW aroused I was. And, embarrassingly enough, I was still tingling after a few minutes, and my hand went down there again. I certainly didn&#8217;t WANT to do it. I was, horrified, embarrassed, every negative feeling about the dream and about myself, and yet I really couldn&#8217;t stop myself. I had another great orgasm all the while feeling awful about it, not wanting at all to do it . . . and yet I DID do it. And a third time, sad to say. I even felt I wanted MORE and I rubbed myself again, but 3 is really my limit, so that was it.

Even as I write this, my heart beats fast and I begin to perspire with dread. And yet there IS that tingle . . .

I was VERY disturbed about it ALL. Certainly the dream, but the fact I had orgasmed over something I consciously HATE, something I would NEVER even consider in real life. Why? It was about 3AM, but I couldn&#8217;t go back to sleep, thinking, ashamed of myself, wondering why it had happened. By morning I was out of the dream and any arousal, but I felt that I wanted to rid myself of that dream, even the memory of it, but somehow I know that won&#8217;t happen, and I haven&#8217;t been able to forget it. And I found myself thinking of it often. And I felt I had to tell you of my dream and the way it made me feel. Disgusted and aroused all at the same time . . . so conflicted in my feelings. I immediately wondered if I was wise to share it with you, but you were so understanding I relaxed and was glad I&#8217;d shared these deep inner thoughts with you.

Then yesterday when you picked me up for our regular Friday evening date, you cuffed my hands behind my back and ran a loop of rope around my throat and around the headrest anchor in the car and snugged it up. I was excited, sometimes you did this and we&#8217;d go on to have a wonderful evening of BDSM play. And when you said you&#8217;d arranged for us to spend a long weekend at a friend&#8217;s ranch far out of town I was excited. I almost didn&#8217;t hear you say you needed to stop at your place before we got underway. We stopped in front of your house and before you went in you pulled a huge ball gag from under the car seat, saying, �I think we need this for you tonight�. I got even more excited, what a weekend I felt coming up. When you came back to the car you opened the back of your SUV and 3 monster dogs jumped in.

Then I knew why you wanted to gag me, I started screaming immediately, but it was muffled to almost nothing. You put the vehicle in gear and started on our way turning to say to me, �sometimes dreams come true dear�, with an evil smile on your face. And you held up a bottle of dark yellow fluid and said, �I even brought their favorite &#8216;perfume&#8217;�, and laughed. Oh God NO, I thought! But I knew it WOULD happen, just like in my dream, and I sobbed and sobbed as the dogs leaned over the seat back and licked tears from my face.
