Synopsis: Is it possible to use neurosurgery to create human robots? And if you could how would they feel?Introduction 
From �Tomorrow's Technology� magazine�.. 
Soft Cybernetics � The New Alchemy? 
  By our science correspondent 
Are we about to see first human robots? Can scientists create zombies? 
�Soft Cybernetics� is a controversial new approach to the problem of creating
  intelligent systems, provides new ways to solve the problems of micro-behaviour
  management. 
To date cybernetics has focused on the use of feed-back and control mechanisms
  to produce self-regulating systems using electromechanical devices. More recently,
  research work suggests that many of the problems associated with programming
  these devices can be solved by the use of biological organisms as an alternative
  to mechanisms. The combination of cloning technologies with soft-cybernetics
  offers the possibility of pre-programmed, designer life forms, able to carry
  out specific tasks or roles. Early experimentation in this field has attracted
  considerable ethical debate. 
As one of the chief proponents of the concept, Dr Stuart Waring, of the University
  of Central England , is exploring the implications of soft-cybernetics through
  the use of a series of �thought-experiments� which examine the consequences
  of cybernetic intervention to adjust the behaviours of biological organisms.
  These thought-experiments alone have given rise to serious objections from
  a wide range of groups concerned about both animal and human rights. 
Most recently the proposition by Waring and his collaborator, Dr Anna Fedorova
  of the Leningrad Centre for Neuroscience, that using by-products of effects
  of specific forms of synesthesia (where information perceived by one sense
  gives rise to a sensation in another - for example where numbers are seen as
  colours) has created alarm that behavioural engineering may become as controversial
  as its genetic cousin.

Chapter 1: The Colour of Numbers 
I see numbers in my head. And I know what they mean. Some people can hear
  colours. I see numbers. Suddenly. A seven. Or a four. And I know what they
  mean. 
There aren't many numbers. Only zero to nine. But I see them. Bright; sudden;
  there in my mind; blotting out everything else. 
I haven't always been able to do this. It is new for me. Since I came here,
  to the house. Before I came I couldn't see the numbers but now I can. I don't
  remember anything else before I came but I do know I couldn't see the numbers. 
I can see a one. It's green. It's very bright. I know I have to find him.
  He is somewhere in the house and I have to find him. Where ever he is I have
  to go there. That's what it means when I see the one. 
I find him in the library. He is with a woman. He smiles as I arrive and turns
  to her. �There, you see,� he says. �Now do you believe me?� 
�That doesn't prove anything,� she replies. �There could be a bell, or a light.
  Remotely controlled. You might have agreed what she was to do.� 
I just stand there, listening, watching, waiting. There isn't anything for
  me to do. I have done what I had to do. I have found him. 
�You try,� he says. He passes a box to the woman. The box has buttons on it. 
�OK, but not from here. She might watch me. I'll leave the room. Then we'll
  see.� She gets up and goes out. The man is smiling at me. He doesn't say anything. 
I see a five. It's purple. I have to undress. I take off my dress; my underwear;
  my shoes; my stockings. I'm naked. I have done what I had to do. 
The woman comes back in. �OK,� she says. �What else. Could be a lucky guess � there's
  only ten buttons. You could be colluding.� 
�Why do you think she would? Believe me this works.� 
The woman turns her back to me. �Yeah, maybe,� she says. I see a six. It's
  white. I start to dress again. Six means I must put on the clothes I see. 
The woman sits down. She hands the box back to the man. �Could be interesting,� she
  says, �if it's for real.� 
�Oh, it's real,� he replies. He juggles the box in his hand. �Would I lie
  to you?� 
I have finished dressing. Suddenly I see a two. It's yellow, a wonderful,
  bright, clean, yellow. I know now that I have to go back to my room. That's
  what a two means. I wonder if the box has anything to do with the numbers? 
Chapter 2: Friends 
The woman is called Dr Anna. The man is called Dr Stuart. I sometimes think
  I knew them before I came here to the house, but I am not sure. Dr Anna and
  Dr Stuart have explained they are my friends. They say they are my friends
  but I am not sure. I feel there is some reason why I should not trust them
  but I cannot say what it is. 
They say that they are here to help me with my numbers. If that is so they
  must be my friends. They know that I see the numbers and that I have to do
  what they tell me. They explain that this is good; that I will feel happy when
  I do what the numbers tell me to do. 
I know this to be true. Perhaps they are my friends after all. 
The numbers only tell me to do simple things at the moment. Dr Stuart tells
  me this is quite normal. He says I need to get used to the simple tasks first.
  I don't know why I must get used to it. I don't know why I do what the numbers
  tell me. But I do. And it makes me happy. I don't know why I do nothing apart
  from what the numbers tell me. But that is true as well. 
Dr Anna is interested in how I feel about the numbers. I tell her that they
  are bright; that I like the light and the colours. She asks me how I feel about
  the tasks. I tell her that I am happy when I am asked to do them. When I finish
  them I know I have done what the numbers wanted. I believe that should make
  me happy too. 
She asks me if I ever feel that I should not do a task but I explain that
  the tasks are easy to do and so there is no reason why I would not do what
  the numbers ask of me. Besides it makes me happy when I see the numbers, makes
  me happy when I do the tasks. Dr Anna is worried in case I am sad when I cannot
  see the numbers. I tell her that isn't so. I am happy when I see the numbers
  but I am not sad when they are not there. It's just that when there are no
  numbers, there is nothing. No happiness, no sadness, nothing to do, nothing.
  Except to wait for the numbers. 
Dr Anna writes all my answers down. I wonder if she has numbers to tell her
  what to do? 
Dr Stuart shows me the box. It is small and dark with many buttons on it.
  It has a small display. It looks a little like the telephones I sometimes see
  Dr Stuart and Dr Anna using, but it is larger. He tells me that this is where
  the numbers come from. He says he will take great care of the box so that I
  can feel safe. Only Dr Stuart or Dr Anna understands the box. Only they know
  how to make the numbers come. I feel safe as long as I can see the numbers.
  Safe and happy. I am only scared that the numbers will not come any more. Then
  what would I do? 
If Dr Stuart and Dr Anna can make sure the numbers come then they must be
  my friends. 
Chapter 3: Number 8 
I am lying on my bed. I see the number 8. It's blue, a very peaceful blue.
  It tells me to sleep. I am doing my best. Dr Stuart and Dr Anna come into the
  room. They are concerned about me. I hear them talking. 
�She seems to be settled now.� 
�Yes, I am pleased with how well she has recovered from the surgery. The connector
  seems to be healing well.� 
�The bruises on her wrists and ankles are going down.� 
�Yes. They will be gone in a few days. It was a shame that I had to restrain
  her but I wasn't sure how she would react. It wasn't a problem as it turned
  out but I'm not sure I could have predicted it.� 
Dr Stuart lifts the sheet that covers me and looks down at my naked body.
  There is no need for me to move. �I am particularly pleased at how well the
  synesthesia appears to have been taken up,� he says. �It seems to work in both
  ways as predicted � the linkage between stimuli and response is fully effective
  and the absence of stimulus results in complete quiescence.� He drops the sheet. 
�So, what next?� 
�The difficulty is in the tasks, I think. They seem to be of two kinds. The
  very simple that require constant intervention or the very complex that have
  too many variables. There needs to be a simpler way of structuring the tasks.
  There is something we can try, though. I have an idea.� 
It is good that Dr Stuart and Dr Anna show such concern. I am pleased that
  they are helping with the tasks. I haven't found it hard to do the tasks so
  far but what would happen if the numbers told me to do something I could not
  do? I find that scares me. I whimper. 
�Hush, Natalie,� Dr Anna, tries to reassure me. �Hush. It's all right. Sleep
  now.� 
I try to sleep. The numbers told me to sleep. I've been having nightmares.
  Dreams about before; before I came to the house; before I could see the numbers. 
In the nightmares, Dr Stuart and Dr Anna are not my friends. They come to
  my room while I am sitting at a desk. I am swallowed up in a cloth. They pull
  the cloth over me. I cannot see them. I cannot move. I cannot speak. Dr Stuart
  and Dr Anna are talking but I cannot speak. I struggle but I cannot move. I
  cry out but there is no sound. Why do my friends do this to me? I fall asleep.
  And then I wake up. 
I am in a white room. The light is bright. As bright as the numbers in my
  head but the light is above me. There are wizards in white. I cannot see their
  faces. They say, �It's all right Natalie.� They tell me not to be afraid but
  somehow I am. 
I am still afraid as I fall asleep again. It is frightening to fall asleep
  when in a dream. How can I know that I am awake now? Or that I am dreaming
  now? Or that I was dreaming then? 
At least I am sure the numbers are real. They are so bright and so clear and
  so colourful. The numbers are too real to be dreams. The tasks are too real
  to be dreams. 
Chapter 4: They Are Not The Same 
I can see more numbers. I woke up this morning and I can see more numbers.
  As soon as I woke up there was twenty two � bright, yellow, brighter than anything
  else in my head And I knew what I had to do. I don't know how many more numbers
  I can see. Only fifteen and seventeen and twenty two. Those are the ones I
  have seen today and I knew what to do. 
I wonder what the new numbers mean. I only know what a number means when I
  see it. Look, if I can see fifteen and seventeen then I guess that I can see
  sixteen too but I cannot guess what it means. And fifteen � I know I can see
  fifteen and I know it means something but it's only when I see it that I know
  what it means. I saw fifteen this morning and I know I had to do something
  and I did it but I don't know what it was. 
That makes it much easier, only remembering when you see the numbers. Most
  of the time I do not remember the numbers and what they mean. If you had to
  remember all of the numbers all of the time it would be much harder. It's a
  useful trick. I wonder how I do it. 
There isn't a number for now. Life is empty when there isn't a number. I just
  wait. Wait for the numbers, wait for the bright numbers. I feel happy when
  I see the numbers, I feel empty when they are not there. 
Oh, there is fifteen now. Clear and orange. And I know what to do. I get up,
  I make my bed, I get the broom and the pan, I sweep my room, I dust my room,
  I clean the sink and bowl in my washroom. That's what 15 means � clean up.
  How could I not remember it? Then I saw a 1 and went to find Dr Stuart. He
  was in the lounge with the box. I saw 15 again and knew I had to clean up there
  too. Dr Stuart watched me do it. He seemed pleased at my work. I just know
  I was happy because the numbers asked me to do it. 
Dr Anna has been talking to me about the numbers. She has been asking me how
  I feel about the numbers. She shows me some numbers which are written down.
  I tell her they are not the same. The numbers in my head are bright. The ones
  on paper are just, well, numbers. They do not have the meaning that the numbers
  in my head do. She shows me some colours and asks me if they make me think
  of numbers. I tell her they do not. The colours on the paper are not the same
  as the colours in my head, although they look the same. 
She shows me a 15. It looks orange. I am sure I know what 15 means but I just
  cannot remember. Dr Anna is puzzled but she is very kind, She doesn't mind
  that I don't remember. 
I heard Dr Anna and Dr Stuart talking. Dr Anna told Dr Stuart that she was
  surprised by some of the results. The effects of synesthesia seem to be interesting
  to her. She is surprised by the quiescence response. She suspects it may have
  something to do with endorphin receptors. I did not really understand what
  I heard but I think it has something to do with how I see the colour of the
  numbers. She is surprised that there I have no recollection of the time before
  I could see the numbers, but how could that be important? I don't remember
  then. There are only my dreams and I am happier without my dreams. 
Chapter 5: On The Radio 
When I woke up today there were new clothes. A plain black dress and tights.
  The dress is quite short, the skirt comes above my knees. It is shorter than
  I used to wear. How come I remember that? But the 6 just tells me to dress,
  I put on whatever is to hand and today it is the black dress. My life is so
  easy, I just do what the numbers say. Somehow it doesn't seem fair. 
I was combing my hair this morning. It seems to be getting much longer. There
  is something strange at the back of my neck. I am sure it was not there before.
  Before when? Just, before.. It feels hard, metallic. Like an electrical socket.
  The sort you would find on a computer. It doesn't hurt but it doesn't feel
  like it should be there. 
It is much later I am sitting in my room. Waiting. Dr Stuart comes into the
  room. He has the box. I see a 5, bright purple, and I undress. Dr. Stuart watches
  with interest. He is obviously interested to see how I respond to the numbers.
  I have finished undressing when Dr Anna comes into the room. She looks strangely
  at Dr Stuart, as if she disapproves of his interest and concern. I see an 8,
  a peaceful, blue 8. I lay down to sleep. 
It is later still. I am lying on my bed, awake. Dr Anna is sitting beside
  me. She seems concerned about me. She turns on the radio beside my bed. The
  woman speaking has a quiet, Edinburgh accent. 
�Hello and welcome to Science Now, your weekly look at the world of technology.
    First tonight I am joined this evening by Dr Stuart Waring who has been at
    the centre of the controversial thought experiments relating to soft-cybernetics.
    Dr Waring, good evening.� 
�Good evening, Kirstie.� 
�On one side, your soft-cybernetics theories have led you to be accused
    of being the Dr Frankenstein of the post-Freud era. On the other you've been
    condemned as a charlatan. Which is it � fiend or fraud?� 
�Well, Kirstie, I hope I'll be able to convince you that I'm neither.
    What my team has been doing in soft-cybernetics is pure research, an exploration
    of what it might mean to combine biological systems and control/feed-back
    systems. We hope to learn what we can about both biology and the nature of
    cybernetic systems.� 
�There's no truth to the accusation that your work paves the way to human
    robots?� 
�Our interest has been in thought experiments � conceptual assessments
    of the issues involved and the possible outcomes of actions in this area.
    Most experts agree that it would be a long way from these conceptual exercises
    to any form of practical application. The real purpose is to help us to understand
    the nature of control systems and of the ways in which the mind governs behaviour.� 
�So, no mindless zombies then?� 
�I'm sorry to disappoint you, but no. The scientific research is much
    more mundane. Let me pose a problem to you that is typical of our thought
    experiments. Suppose you could control an animal's every movement. How could
    you translate that into making the animal perform useful tasks? It would
    be useless if you had to control it in real time like a radio controlled
    car � the effort to control it would be as great as if the task was carried
    out by yourself. But how can you provide the animal with a goal or set of
    actions to perform? And what is the mechanism that translates your requests
    into action? For example if I say �Sit' to a dog and it sits, is the dog
    a robot?� 
�No, clearly not.� 
�Well suppose that I were to create a tape of commands including �Sit'
    and place it in a player fixed to the dog's back so that it played a series
    of commands in sequence. If the dog follows each command and then sits is
    it a robot?� 
�Well, no.� 
�But if I did the same thing with a mechanical representation of a dog
    and the same actions were to occur would that be a robot?� 
�Yes, yes it would.� 
�Now does this tell us more about the nature of dogs, the nature of mechanical
    toys, the nature of commands or the idea of robots? To me the issue seems
    to involve the freedom to behave otherwise. Some of my critics have suggested
    that my interest is in suppressing human free will. I would argue that I
    am interested in understanding what exactly it is that distinguishes us from
    the mechanical.� 
�Dr Waring, thank you. I am sure that many people will have been both
    reassured and intrigued by your ideas. Now, for our second item this evening.
    New power for the motor car. Can the promise of electrical energy for reducing
    road pollution be realised�..� 
Dr Anna leans forward and strokes my hair in a tender way as she turns the
  radio off. �There,� she says, �you see how Dr Waring thinks so carefully about
  these things?� 
I say nothing. I used to have a dog that would sit when I said so. Dr Stuart
  didn't mention the numbers, though. I wonder why he didn't tell her about them.
  They are the most important thing we have. 
Chapter 6: Upload 
The girl is half sitting, half lying, sedated, barely awake, on a reclining
  couch. A net cap covers her scalp and carries an array of electrodes. Wires
  run from each, eventually joining up to form a thick, electrical umbilical
  cord running to the electro- encephalograph. A series of green lines on a display
  trace the activity detected by each electrode. Quiet bleeps mark time for her
  pulse and respiration. 
He checks the monitors. He opens a folder and checks the paper on the inside
  cover. He checks the small needle mark on the inside of her arm where the injection
  was administered. 
Satisfied that temperature, pulse, respiration and brain functions all appear
  normal he nods to his collaborator. He reaches behind the girl's head and fastens
  the connector in place. A cable runs from the connector to the computer on
  the trolley beside the couch. He checks the monitors again. No change in the
  traces. 
The woman starts the drive on the pen recorder of the encephalograph. She
  looks across at the girl on the couch. The man scrolls down a menu on the computer
  and selects �load�. He presses enter. 
On the couch the girl's eyes swing wide open. The monitors and the pens on
  the pen recorder swing into frenetic activity. Her eyes dart back and forth,
  unseeing. At times her hands clench and open again but apart from that she
  does not move. Her breathing becomes shallow, her breaths are shorter, she
  is almost panting, quietly. 
It takes only a few minutes. The hourglass icon on the computer's screen stops
  spinning. The pen traces slip back to a steady line. The green fluorescent
  lines on the monitors slip back to their steady repetitive beat. The girl's
  eyes close. She is breathing easily, now, asleep. 
He writes on the scroll of paper spilling from the pen recorder. �Natalie
  : Upload Nrs. 25 to 50 and scripts version 1.1 Beta.� He adds the date and
  time and folds the paper neatly. He tucks it into the folder. 
The woman carefully unfastens the connector from the back of the girl's head
  and then removes the scalp net, the pulse and respiration monitors. They wheel
  the girl back to her room and put her to bed. 
Chapter 7: Natalie's Paper 
I dreamt I was in a white room with the white wizards. The wizards brought
  me numbers. They gave me lists of things to do. Things to do when I see the
  numbers. 
It is still dark but now I am awake. I can see two figures silhouetted in
  the doorway to my room. It is Dr Stuart and Dr Anna. I hear them talking. 
�Is she awake yet?� 
�Yes, I think so but she will lie still there until she has to respond.� 
�What are the new scripts?� 
�Mainly domestic tasks, some of them are combos � concatenations of other
  scripts under a single number to make control easier. It's too much effort
  if you have to keep giving individual commands.� 
�Do we need to do anything about command reception?� 
�No, I think it appears to be adequate within the building and the new transmitter
  will be slightly more powerful. I'd prefer to do things at this end rather
  than having to do any further surgery.� 
The two of them are still standing there, looking at me. I hear Dr Anna speak. 
�I read it.� 
�What?� 
�The paper � �Induced Numerical Synesthesia as a Vector for Operant Conditioning.'
  Natalie Grahams' doctoral thesis.� 
�It was rather good wasn't it? I felt it delivered an excellent theoretical
  basis for a practical mechanism for soft-cybernetics.� 
�Yes. Yes, it was. Don't you wish you'd written it?� 
�Well, perhaps. It's the curse of the teacher to be overtaken by their brightest
  students.� 
�She never foresaw this, you know. Not the application of her work. I don't
  think she ever thought it would really be possible to link into the frontal
  lobe of the cerebral cortex. Not in any practical way.� 
�So you'll allow me my contribution to this project then?� 
�Of course, Stuart. It's extraordinary what you've done.� 
�Well, maybe.� Dr Waring is looking at me again. 
Dr Anna interrupts him. �She's lost it all, you know. Anything she ever knew,
  any memories. The intellect has gone. There's nothing left of her mind. Just
  the numbers and the tasks.� 
�Hmm? Oh, yes. That seems to be a side effect. A shame, I guess.� 
They go away, leaving me alone. How strange. For some reason I think that
  Natalie is my name. 
Chapter 8: Number 5 
It is afternoon. I am in my room, alone. I see a 5. I undress. That is unusual.
  I do not often see a 5 until late at night. There is usually a 5 and then an
  8 to tell me to sleep. Oh, now I am remembering what some of the numbers mean.
  I wonder if I am supposed to do that? But now there is just a 5. 
Dr Stuart appears. He is smiling. He approaches me and places a hand upon
  my naked breast. �You respond very well to your numbers. This is exactly how
  I expected to find you. Now, come and lay down. I will show you something.� He
  leads me to the bed and lays me down with my arms by my sides, my legs slightly
  apart. 
Dr Stuart is undressing. He is naked as well. He lies down beside me. I feel
  his fingers part my thighs. I feel his fingers inside me. He climbs on top
  of me. I feel him penetrate me. There isn't anything for me to do, there are
  no numbers now. 
Dr Stuart is stroking my breasts. He tells me I am a perfect doll, I am his
  perfect doll, just a doll. His breathing becomes sharper, his voice is deeper,
  his muscles tense. I feel him cum, violently, inside of me. He lays there for
  a time but then gets up and leaves me. I see a 7. I take a shower. I see an
  8 and lay down to sleep. 
This time I do not dream. 
It is later. I wake up. I hear Dr Stuart and Dr Anna. They are talking together
  again but now they are talking in loud voices. Dr Anna is shouting. She is
  shouting, �Pervert!� Dr Stuart is quieter. He is trying to calm Dr Anna, but
  she is still upset, still shouting. �Is that what this was all about really?
  It's nothing to do with the science! Is it?� I cannot hear everything she is
  shouting but she is very upset. The shouting seems to go on for a long time. 
Much later I wake again. It is still dark. The shouting has stopped. 
It is daylight. I awake. I see a 7 and a 6 and a 1. I shower, dress and go
  to find Dr Stuart. He is with Dr Anna but things are different. She is naked.
  She is sitting in a chair. She cannot get up. Straps hold her in the chair.
  She seems to want to get up but she cannot. She tries to talk as I enter but
  there is tape across her mouth and I cannot make out what she is saying. 
Dr Stuart gives me some clothes, they are the clothes that Dr Anna was wearing
  last night. He presses a button. 27 � laundry. I know what I have to do. As
  I leave I see that Dr Stuart is playing with Dr Anna's breast as he played
  with mine. She struggles to resist him but the straps are holding her down.
  He smiles and tells her to be still. She tries to answer him but the tape stops
  any sound. He picks up a hypodermic syringe. Dr Anna's eyes are wide open.
  She shakes her head. I think she tries to scream behind the tape. I think she
  is really scared. 
She doesn't look happy. Not happy like I am. As long as I can do what the
  numbers tell me. 
But I see 27 and I must do as the numbers tell me. 
Chapter 9: Pleasure Unit 
I am sitting in the bedroom. Dr Stuart and Dr Anna are there as well. She
  is standing by the door, he is lounging on the bed. I'm a wearing my simple
  uniform dress. She has on a long, black, evening gown. It is cut very low and
  shows her cleavage. There is a simple velvet band around her throat. Her long
  hair is dressed and piled high upon her head. She wears long evening gloves
  that match her dress. Her face is made up perfectly but she isn't smiling as
  she usually does. 
Dr Stuart presses a button on his control box. I see a zero. I must smile
  and recite. �About: Soft Cybernetics Software Version 1.63 : Scripts Version
  2.5 : Variant - Utility Unit� Dr Stuart says, �Thank you, Natalie.� That's
  interesting he has not called me that before. I thought that was my name but
  he hasn't called me that before. I think I know something about Natalie but
  I cannot remember what it is. 
He turns a small control on the box and presses the button again. 
Dr Anna appears to jerk and stiffen and then she speaks. �About: Soft Cybernetics
  Software Version 1.63 : Scripts Version 2.75 : Variant - Pleasure Unit.� She
  smiles as I smile but then I watch as a tear trickles down her cheek. 
Dr Waring says, �Thank you, Anna.� He presses another button and she turns
  to leave the room. 
As Dr Anna turns her head I see that she has a small connector on the back
  of her neck. Like the ones you see on computers. I wonder, does my one looks
  the same? I wonder if that is why Dr Anna can see the numbers now. I wonder
  if the numbers will make her happy. I think that Dr Stuart had something to
  do with helping Dr Anna be able to see the numbers. Do you think the numbers
  tell him what to do? I don't see a connector. 
Chapter 10: Breaking News 
From �Tomorrow's Technology� magazine�.. 
Brain Drain For Robot Champion Waring 
�Dr Stuart Waring is citing negative comment in the tabloid press as the
    reason for abandoning research into soft-cybernetics here in the UK .
    Protests surrounding the professor's work on �living robots� have rendered
    work at the University  of Central England  impossible,
    claimed Waring in a statement. Dr Waring and his collaborator Dr Fedorova,
    together with Natalie Grahams, widely recognised as the post-graduate researcher
    responsible for many of the concepts underpinning Waring and Fedorova's thought
    experiments are to establish a new research facility in the USA . 
�Dr Waring made the announcement at a press conference yesterday, confirming
    that Grahams and Fedorova had already left the country for the facility in Colorado . 
�Dr Waring would not confirm or deny rumours that US military funding
    was helping to establish the centre and gave no indication of future directions
    for the team's research.� 
++----++ 
Chapter 11: Colorado 
I have a new home. I can see mountains. We are a long way from England . We
  came on an aeroplane. 
Anna and I share a room now. She is happier. I am sure the numbers have made
  her happier. She smiles much more but she still cries sometimes, crying while
  she smiles. 
We each have different tasks to perform. I believe we both see the same numbers
  sometimes because we do things together. But we have different numbers too.
  There are some things that Anna does not do. Some things that I do not do.
  I wonder what Anna did before she came here, before she could see the numbers?
  I wonder what I did, too. 
Dr Stuart has a new helper, Dr Wallis. She tells us that she is helping to
  make the numbers clearer for us. She says she is our friend. I believe her.
  She takes a lot of trouble to see that we can see the numbers. She is most
  interested in how we see the numbers. She shows me pictures of the numbers
  like� Like what? I think someone showed me pictures of the numbers before but
  I cannot remember. 
Anna often sees numbers at night. I may be sleeping but sometimes I wake up
  when she leaves. It can only be because the numbers have told her to go. She
  often goes naked. That is strange because she has so many pretty clothes. 
We both had new clothes when we came here. Mine are quite dark because of
  the work that the numbers tell me to do around the house but I still think
  they are nice. Dr Stuart thinks they are nice too. He tells me how attractive
  they make me look - that the short skirts show off my legs and the tight tops
  make my breasts look nice. I am pleased that he likes them. I just wear them
  because they are there when the numbers tell me to dress. Sometimes he will
  touch me, stroke my breasts or my legs. Dr Wallis does not seem to mind. Dr
  Wallis likes how my clothes look too. Sometimes she touches me as well. 
Last night Anna dressed before she left. It was quite strange. She put on
  her clothes, I guess she saw a 6. That tells us to dress. The clothes are on
  the chairs beside our beds. Sometimes we put the clothes there. Sometimes they
  come from somewhere else. Anna put on her clothes. I watched as Anna put on
  her clothes. She has such pretty clothes. Her bra and pants are lacy. She puts
  on stockings. Her blouse is very tight, it clings to her breasts. Her skirt
  is very tight as well. Straight, and tight. She puts on shoes. The heels are
  high and spiked. But then something strange. She puts on more hair. It is a
  wig. Long and blonde over her own short dark hair. And then something else.
  A mask. It covers her face completely but it is a face itself. A perfect, doll
  face. Long eyelashes, perfect lips, blushed cheeks. Anna looks in the mirror
  and straightens her wig. She walks slowly from the room. I couldn't tell if
  she was smiling, I couldn't tell if she was crying. 
I think she will be Dr Stuart's perfect doll tonight. 
Chapter 12: Expansion 
I think that Dr Stuart's work is going very well. I do not see him so often
  now, he is very busy. Mostly it is Dr Wallis who is helping me with the numbers.
  The numbers want me to help Dr Wallis. Today I saw a 1 and went to find her.
  She gave me a pile of clothes the numbers said 27 and I knew to launder and
  press them before returning them to her. The numbers said 18 and I knew that
  I had to wait until Dr Wallis told me what she would want. 
�Fetch me a drink, please, Natalie,� Dr Wallis said. �Some white wine would
  be fine.� 
I fetched the wine for her. 19 � I helped her to undress. 21 � I helped her
  to shower. 20 � I helped her to dress again. Dr Wallis presses the buttons
  on the box that lets me see the numbers. I wonder how Dr Wallis knows what
  the numbers want me to do. 
But now there are more of us, more who can see the numbers and do their will. 
Today I saw a new number. First there was a 1. When I found him he had three
  women with him. They were as Anna was, just before she started to see the numbers
  - naked and strapped and silenced. It must help them to prepare for the numbers;
  the straps and the silencing, I mean. They seemed alarmed when I appeared,
  I don't know why. I wonder how they got here? 
I was smiling but that did not seem to reassure them. Dr Stuart tried to calm
  them. He explained how happy I am, now that I see the numbers. They could see
  I was smiling. It didn't seem to calm them. 
I saw 51. A new number. As bright as the others. Bright and blue. I knew what
  I had to do. I took the leash that clipped to the collar of the first woman.
  I knew where I was leading them. I was not sure how but I knew. I took them
  to another part of the building. There was a small room for each of them. The
  rooms have no windows. The rooms have only a small bed. I put them into their
  rooms. Each of them has a tag to say who they are. Alice, and Crystal and Suzanne.
  The tags must be so that Dr Stuart and Dr Wallis know who they are. It is harder
  now there are more of us but the numbers always seem to know which one is needed.
  I closed the doors behind them. I locked the doors. I left the straps and tape
  upon them. I had to be sure that they would remain where they were otherwise
  they might not get to serve the numbers. They sobbed and tried to cry out.
  They cannot know how happy they will be when they are doing what the numbers
  tell them. 
When I woke up this morning and the numbers told me to dress I had some nice
  new clothes. I have a new black dress. It has a square collar and short sleeves.
  It buttons at the back. The skirt is very short and flares a little. It has �Natalie� embroidered
  in small letters upon it. I have some new tights. They are much finer than
  the ones I wore before. And new shoes. With higher heels. Perhaps they are
  a present from the numbers. 
I see a 1. I go to find Dr Wallis. She is in the large meeting room with Dr
  Stuart. There are four others there, Anna and the three newcomers. They are
  wearing the same dress that I do, the same tights, the same shoes. We all have
  our hair done identically. Each has a name embroidered on their dress as mine
  does. �Anna�, �Alice�, �Crystal� and �Suzanne�. They are standing quite still
  with their hands by their sides. They are smiling. I join them. We are all
  smiling. 
Dr Wallis turns a control on the box and presses a button. I see a 0 and start
  to recite, �About: Soft Cybernetics Software Version 2.54 : Scripts Version
  3.8 ��. I become aware that we are all reciting the same thing, simultaneously.
  How remarkable. 
Dr Stuart is evidently pleased that we are all seeing the same number at the
  same time. He smiles. �Excellent,� he says. 
Another button. I see a 5 and start to undress. Again all five of us have
  seen the number together. I see a 10 and stop. We have all taken off our dresses
  and now just stand in bra, pants and tights. Dr Stuart is pleased and grins
  at Dr Wallis. �That is good,� he says. How good that the numbers help us make
  Dr Stuart so pleased. He takes the trouble to touch each of us as Dr Wallis
  looks on. We all stand still � that's what the 10 tells us. Dr Stuart strokes
  the cheek of Crystal who is standing next to me. She stands still while he
  does this. She is still smiling but somehow she does not seem happy. 
It is nice that there are five of us now. Sometimes the numbers ask us to
  do things at the same time. Somehow that is better than when we do the alone.
  I like it when the numbers ask Anna and I to do things at the same time. 
The numbers often ask Crystal and Suzanne to do things at the same time. Often
  at night. Sometimes they use the same doll face masks that Anna had. Sometimes
  they wear nothing but their masks and their wigs. The numbers don't seem to
  ask Anna to wear her mask and wig any more. I do not know if that makes her
  sad. She still smiles. We all smile. 
Chapter 13: Limitations 
Dr Wallis came to my room when I was lying on my bed last night. It was very
  late. She didn't put on a light. She told me not to be afraid. I am not afraid
  because I know that Dr Wallis is my friend. Then she did something strange.
  She put tape across my mouth. I don't know why, I never talk unless I am asked
  a question. I have seen the tape before but I only talk when I am asked. 
She used metal bracelets to lock my wrists to the bed rail. I don't know why.
  I never move unless the numbers tell me too. I suppose she might have been
  worried that the numbers would suddenly take me away. 
She had a small computer with her. I think the numbers come from inside computers.
  I have seen a bigger computer in the white room but she had a small one in
  my room. There was a cable. I felt her plug the cable into my connector. Dr
  Wallis could see that I was a little afraid. She told me not to worry. She
  told me that the numbers wanted me not to worry. That was strange because usually
  the numbers tell me themselves. But I believe Dr Wallis. She is my friend. 
Dr Wallis pressed some keys on her computer. I felt a tingle in my head. Like
  when I am in the big white room with the big computer. But it was only a little
  tingle. I didn't cry out or struggle. Dr Wallis didn't need the tape and the
  bracelets after all. But I expect she was only being careful. She took them
  off and left me then. I fell asleep. I dreamt the same dreams that I dream
  when I have been in the big white room. I wonder if I will see some new numbers
  now. 
It is some time later. It is dark I have been sleeping. I suddenly see a very
  bright number 1. I get up and go to find Dr Wallis. I am still naked, the numbers
  did not tell me to dress. Dr Wallis is with Dr Stuart. They are arguing. He
  is shouting, waving some papers at her. He says she has betrayed him. She asks
  him where he thought the funding was coming from. He says she is trying to
  cheat him. He says her friends are trying to steal his ideas. Dr Wallis lunges
  at the box. She presses a button. I see 90 glowing bright in gold. It looks
  so pretty but I don't like what it tells me. I must shoot Dr Waring. Can that
  be right? 
The numbers have always been right before but I have never seen this one.
  It does glow brightly though, so it must be right. There is a gun on the table.
  I pick it up. As I pull the trigger Dr Stuart pulls Dr Wallis between us. The
  first bullet hits her in the throat. There is a lot of blood. I didn't mean
  to do that. I hope the numbers do not punish me. Dr Stuart pushes Dr Wallis
  away. She falls to the floor. I have not done what I was told to do. Dr Stuart
  tries to run. I pull the trigger again and again. The noise is terrible. The
  bullets hit Dr Stuart as he reaches the door. He collapses to the floor. He
  doesn't move. Neither does Dr Wallis. 
I have done what the numbers told me but now what must I do? There are no
  numbers, nothing. I see the box has fallen from Dr Wallis' hand. It lies in
  pieces on the floor. There are no numbers. There is nothing for me to do. I
  just stand and wait. Nobody comes. I guess the numbers did not ask the others
  to come too. 
Chapter 14: In The White Room 
I am in a white room. It is like the one in my dreams, in my nightmares. There
  are no wizards in white here, just people; people in white. I think they know
  about the numbers but I don't see numbers any more. I think they know about
  the box � I have seen some of them with the box. But no one seems to want to
  use it any more. Perhaps they are frightened of what happened to Dr Wallis
  and Dr Stuart? Or perhaps the box is broken? Or perhaps the numbers will not
  come for them even if they have the box? 
I was in the room with Dr Wallis and Dr Stuart for a long time. I saw no numbers
  to tell me to go. I watched them bleed and then they stopped bleeding and then
  the blood turned brown. I was still holding the gun when the policemen came.
  I didn't know to put it down. I think the policemen were quite frightened because
  they shouted so. They took the gun away from me. Then they took me away. And
  Crystal and Alice and Anna and Suzanne. 
We each have a white room here. It's not as comfortable as our rooms at the
  house but it doesn't matter. I just hope that I can get to see the numbers
  again. 
There is another doctor here, Doctor James. He tells me that I have nothing
  to worry about. I don't believe him. How can I be happy without the numbers?
  He has given me a special jacket with arms that lace behind my back. The jacket
  is very stiff. With buckles and straps. They remind me of the straps that Dr
  Stuart used. Why do I remember that? 
Dr James says he is worried that I might hurt myself because I cannot see
  the numbers. That is why I have the jacket. And Crystal and Alice and Anna
  and Suzanne. 
He tells me it wasn't my fault. About Dr Stuart and Dr Wallis. I know that
  of course. I only did what the numbers asked me. 
He says he will help me to sleep. A nurse gives me an injection. It does help
  me to sleep. Doesn't he know he need only have asked the numbers to be an 8. 
Chapter 15: Number 9 Dream 
I can see the numbers again. Terrible things have happened but I can see the
  numbers again. 
I was asleep. Well, not asleep like when I see an 8, but resting, resting
  after an injection. There were loud noises, like the sounds of the gun when
  I saw the number 90, the big gold 90. Men came into my room. They were wearing
  masks. They were carrying guns. 
They put me on a trolley and wheeled me from my room. There was smoke in the
  corridor. There was blood in the corridor. I saw Dr James; he was lying in
  the corridor; he wasn't moving. I saw the nurse; she was lying in the corridor;
  she wasn't moving either. The doors at the end of the corridor were broken.
  The masked men pushed me through the doors to an ambulance. The driver was
  lying on the ground. There was a lot of blood. He wasn't moving. Crystal and
  Alice and Anna and Suzanne were there as well. They seemed safe but they were
  scared, just as I was. I saw Dr Stuart's computers and Dr Wallis' files. And
  the box. 
The ambulance took us a long way. We went again in a plane but not a big plane.
  We are in a new house but it is not near mountains. The countryside is very
  dry and hot. But I do not mind because I see the numbers again. I see the numbers
  and I am happy. 
I think that Anna and Crystal and Alice and Suzanne can see the numbers because
  they look happy too. 
I have a new friend. He tells me he is Mr English. He knows how to make the
  numbers come and so he must be my friend. He has friends to help him. They
  are Mr French, Mr Dutch and Miss Scott. Mr English has made copies of the box
  so that all his friends can help us with the numbers. 
Mr English says I must not worry about Dr Waring and Dr Wallis. He says Dr
  Wallis was helping Dr Waring so she could bring us here. Why would I worry
  about Dr Stuart and Dr Wallis? I did what the numbers told me, it must have
  been right. 
We do not have to wear our jackets any more. I think that Mr English knows
  that we are happy now and will not hurt ourselves. We do not have any clothes
  but it is warm here so I do not mind. Mr English seems to like watching my
  body just as Dr Waring did. I do not mind, I have the numbers again and I am
  happy, I have not been Mr English's doll yet, I wonder if I shall be. 
I was with Mr English today when something interesting happened. Mr Dutch
  and Miss Scott came into the room. They brought a woman with them. She didn't
  seem to want to be there. Her arms were strapped and she had a cloth in her
  mouth, She struggled when Mr Dutch sat her in a chair. Her clothes were torn.
  Mr Dutch seemed to like that. 
Mr English said that she would help them with some programming. The woman
  shook her head. Mr English asked her if she would like to be like me. She shook
  her head again. She cannot know how good it feels to see the numbers. Mr English
  suggested that she think again, he asks if she would like to spend some more
  time with Mr Dutch. She shook her head again. It seems so hard for Mr English
  to get her to do what he wants. What a pity Mr English does not have a box
  for the woman, what a pity she does not have a connector. 
Later on I was lying on my bed and she came to me with Mr Dutch. She has an
  identity badge clipped to the pocket of her torn blouse. It says �Heather Blanik,
  Research Assistant, Department of Computer Science, University of Colorado
  at Boulder �. It has some numbers and a bar code on it. It has a photograph
  of her. It must have been taken before she came here. It doesn't show her black
  eye or the bruise on her cheek. It doesn't show her torn blouse or the burn
  marks on her right breast. She looks happier in the photograph. Do you suppose
  she could see the numbers then? Mr Dutch tells her that she will help me with
  my numbers. She nods but she doesn't look happy. I am sure she would be happy
  if she knew how good it is to see the numbers. 
Heather is very kind to us. She works so hard to help us with our numbers.
  Mr Dutch gives her a lot of encouragement. He watches her all the time when
  she is working with us. She helps me and she helps Anna and Crystal and Alice
  and Suzanne. Mr Dutch has found her some other clothes to wear. She doesn't
  have her torn blouse and skirt any more. She wears some metal bracelets too,
  they are joined by a short chain. They look to me as though they make it harder
  for her to do her work but Mr Dutch likes her to wear the bracelets. 
I saw Heather later this morning. She was with Mr English when the numbers
  asked me to fetch him a drink. She was kneeling down in front of him. Her blouse
  is torn again. And her skirt. She has red marks on her legs, as if she has
  been struck with a cane or a stick. The chain between her bracelets runs behind
  her back now, she cannot really use her hands. She has her mouth around Mr
  English's� Mr English's what? She has her mouth around the thing that Dr Stuart
  used to push into me when I was Dr Stuart's doll. Mr English seems to enjoy
  having her mouth there. Mr English is smiling and holding her head against
  him. She doesn't seem to be enjoying it, I can hear her moaning. Mr English
  is talking to Heather. �Now do you get the idea?� he says. �Do you think you
  can get your little computer to tell these robo-chicks to do this? Hmm?� 
Heather seems to think she can. I think she says yes but it is hard to tell.
  She seems to choke as Mr English thrusts against her mouth. He fills her mouth
  until she is choking. He seems to be enjoying it but I do not think Heather
  is. I wonder what a robo-chick is? 
Mr English pushes her away. She is sobbing now. He takes his drink and picks
  up the box. I see a yellow 2, a nice bright yellow 2. I go back to my room,
  happy to have seen the number. 
Chapter 16: We Can Remember It For You Wholesale 
  I see a 1, a bright, green one. I must find the controller. Miss Scott has
    the box. She straps me to a chair. I wonder why. I see Heather come into
    the room with her small computer. I think that she will give me some more
    numbers. 
Heather has been crying. There are more red marks on her legs. She is still
  wearing her bracelets. She plugs a lead from her computer into the socket at
  the back of my neck. It feels strange. I think that this has happened before.
  It's very like what happens in my dreams, but I am asleep when it happens in
  my dreams. I am not sure that she should be doing this while I am awake but
  I am sure that Miss Scott knows what Heather should be doing. 
Heather presses some keys on her computer. Suddenly my head is filled with
  numbers, whirling, spinning, terrifying numbers, bright and shining, one after
  another. I shake my head. I cry out. Miss Scott tries to hold me down. I am
  struggling in the chair as I feel my head filling with numbers. So many, all
  at once, so bright. They scare me there are so many. How can I hope to do all
  that they wish? 
And then it stops. As soon as it started. I am calm again. There is no rush.
  My head no longer feels filled. 
Heather says to Miss Scott, �There, I said she should have been sedated.� 
Miss Scott swings her hand around and slaps Heather's face. Heather cries
  out in pain and puts her hands up to defend herself but there are no more blows. �Don't
  get cute with me, cunt,� Miss Scott says. �You just do as you're told or Mr
  Dutch will be back to pay you another visit.� 
Miss Scott is always kind to me. She unfastens my straps and reaches for the
  box. I see a 2. I leave to go back to my room and as I do I see Anna and Crystal
  and Alice and Suzanne in the corridor. I see an 8 and I sleep. I don't dream.
  Perhaps it is all to the good. 
It is evening when I wake again. I see a 1 and go to find the controller.
  Miss Scott is waiting for me. I see 18, she asks me for a drink. I fetch it
  for her. As I am pouring the wine Mr Dutch brings Heather in again. I think
  that Heather must have upset Mr Dutch again. She has been tied up. The ropes
  look very tight. They criss-cross her chest and pull her arms back behind her.
  She has a cloth in her mouth again. This time it is stuffed deep into her mouth.
  There is a rope tied around her head to keep the cloth in place. The rope looks
  tight, I think it must be painful for her. She is squealing and struggling.
  Mr Dutch does not look concerned. 
Miss Scott reaches for the box. I see a 60. I don't think I have seen that
  before but I know what I have to do. I kneel before Miss Scott and lift her
  skirt. I see she is not wearing panties. That is good because I know I have
  to kiss her, know I have to lick and tongue her. The 60 is very bright and
  I am happy to do what it tells me. Miss Scott is happy for me to do it too.
  Mr Dutch seems happy too. He is laughing. Heather is screaming into her cloth.
  I see a 10 and stop. 
Miss Scott speaks to Heather. �See,� she says. �Your programming skills are
  perfect.� 
I see a 51. I haven't seen that for a long time. I remember that it means
  I have to take Heather to her cell. Mr Dutch gives me the rope that is tied
  around her neck. �You'd better follow her,� he says to Heather. It seems unfair
  to put Heather back into her cell. After all Heather has been so kind to me.
  It's unfair not to take off her ropes, unfair not to remove the cloth. But
  the numbers didn't ask me to do any of those things. They just said put her
  back in her cell. I guess they know what's best. 
Chapter 17: Rewind &amp; Reload 
Something strange happened today. I saw a number and I didn't know what to
  do. I was with Mr English. He had his box. I saw the number 16. It wasn't as
  bright as the numbers usually are but I could still see it. It was grey. Usually
  the numbers are bright colours the same colour for the each number. But this
  was grey. I am sure that 16 was not grey before. 
Mr English seemed angry. Angry with the box. He pressed the buttons again
  and again. I saw 16; the grey 16. But I still didn't know what to do. Then
  he pressed another button. It was 2. As bright and as yellow as before. And
  I knew what to do. I went back to my room. Mr English looked puzzled as I left.
  He put the box down and picked up the telephone. 
I have been lying on my bed. I have been thinking about number 16. It was
  a very odd feeling. And then another thought came into my head. I cannot say
  I remembered it because I do not know where it came from. All of a sudden I
  heard myself say, �It is possible that prolonged excitement of the cortex through
  induced synesthesia could result in deterioration of higher brain functions
  (Jacobs, pp 17-19) while others (Mayerling, Fedorova, Castle) have suggested
  that the effects of induced synesthesia will decay over time.� 
What an extraordinary thing. Perhaps it is something I heard Dr Anna say before
  she became happy with the numbers. Perhaps it is something I heard Dr Waring
  say before� Before what? I wonder what happened to Dr Waring? How strange that
  I remember some things and not others. How strange that I said something like
  that. I really feel as though it was something that I knew really well. 
I can see a 1. A big, bright, grey, 1. I wonder what it means. I still feel
  happy when I see the grey numbers. It's as though the numbers have decided
  that I have done enough tasks now. I don't need to do things any more. The
  grey numbers still come to comfort me but I do not have to do things any more. 
    
  I am lying on my bed. I can see an 8. It is grey. All the numbers are grey
  now. I am sure that the numbers used to be coloured. Then I hear myself say, �Synesthesia
  as a phenomenon has been observed in a number of different forms where individuals
  hear colours, taste shapes, or experience other sensory confusions. It is estimated
  that 1 in 25,000 individuals is borne with some aspect of (Cytowic, 1989, 1993).
  In this paper it is suggested that some forms of synesthesia can be artificially
  stimulated in higher mammals through electrical excitation of the frontal lobe
  of the cortex.� Where can that be from? 
It is strange that I am seeing these things now. Strange that the numbers
  no longer tell me what to do. Perhaps the numbers want me to decide what to
  do? That would be stranger still. Imagine, not having to wait for the numbers,
  just knowing what to do, deciding what to do. Can that be what is happening
  to me? 
I hear voices at the door of my room. �You know what is happening?� It is
  Mr French. 
�I know she's not responding to the box.� Miss Scott is there too. 
�Hmm, well I think I can fix it. It sounds like function decay.� 
�Function decay?� 
�Uh huh. It's always a good idea to read help files you know. I had a look
  on the lap-top that we picked up. You know the upload programme?� 
�Yeah, sure. Heather was using it yesterday to give the Anna unit some more
  domestic tasks.� 
�Well on the menu bar is a drop down labelled �Tools'. The answer is in there.� 
I hear their voices recede as the walk away down the corridor. I remember
  more about Anna. She and I worked together. This was before the numbers. We
  worked in a big school. No, a university. She worked with Dr Waring and I worked
  with Dr Waring. He had been really impressed with something I'd done. I remember
  he was really excited. I saw him discussing it with Anna. I remember them both
  coming to my room. They wanted to explain something to me. They showed me some
  plans. I remember being very upset by their plans but I don't remember what
  they were. I just know that this was before the numbers. 
I see an 8 again. I wish I knew what it meant. I only know that I feel tired.
  I only know that I want to sleep. 
Chapter 18: The Right Format 
Natalie is lying on the couch, naked. Straps hold her to the couch and she
  is trying to struggle. A Whitehead Gag has ratcheted her mouth open. Miss Scott
  is wearing a white coat and a surgical mask. She forces a hypodermic needle
  into Natalie's arm and watches as her struggles slowly subside. She is still
  conscious but heavily sedated. 
She hears Miss Scott say. �I think we are doing this just in time. We had
  to force her on to the trolley. It wasn't easy. This had better work or we're
  really in trouble.� 
Miss Scott fastens the cable from the computer to the connector at the back
  of Natalie's. She walks across to where Mr French is working with the computer. 
�You see,� he says, calmly, �it's always worth reading the manual.� He points
  with the cursor at the menu bar. He clicks and the tools menu opens. There
  are three tabs, �Numbers', �Scripts' and �Target'. Under �Target' there are
  four buttons. One says �List'; one says �Defrag'; one says �Recharge' and one
  says �Format'. He clicks on the last button. 
Natalie twitches on the couch. A message appears on the computer screen. �Target
  is already operating under Soft Cybernetics software. Are you sure you wish
  to re-format.� 
Mr French clicks on �YES'. 
Another message, �Caution : Reformat will cause loss of all scripts and numbers
  in the target. Upload of scripts and numbers will be required. Do you wish
  to proceed?� 
Mr French looks at Miss Scott. �Here we go.� He clicks the button, 'YES'. 
Natalie's eyes swing wide open. In spite of the gag; in spite of the sedative;
  she is screaming. She tries to lift herself up on the couch but the straps
  hold her down. The strap across her forehead ensures she cannot lift her head.
  The connector stays in place as the counter works its way across the screen
  of the computer. 15% � 25% � 50% � 75% 
The computer screen says, �Format Complete � Soft Cybernetics Tools Version
  1.0a &copy;S. Waring 2003�. Natalie is still twitching against the straps but
  slowly her struggles and her strangled screaming subside. The sedative takes
  over. Miss Scott checks the straps. Natalie's wrists and ankles are quite bruised
  but the straps are secure. 
�Now the first numbers and scripts,� says Mr French. He presses more keys
  and initiates the upload. This time Natalie hardly reacts. 
�Finally we have to re-charge,� says Mr. French. �Look here.� he says pointing
  to an x-ray photograph hanging on a light box on the wall of the room. The
  x-ray is of a human skull, Natalie's skull. The connector is clearly visible
  as an opaque block at the nape of the neck. In front of it another opaque block,
  the receiver. And from the receiver thin lines stretch out through the brain
  into the frontal lobe of the cortex, the wires that carry the signals. �This
  is the receiver and this is the emitter,� says French. �They're right behind
  the connector but their batteries only gets recharged when the cable is connected.
  We haven't uploaded or modified numbers for a while so the batteries in the
  receiver and the emitter are low. See, here.� He points to the screen of the
  computer. 
Miss Scott is looking at the panel labelled �Receiver Power Status'. It is
  flashing red. A message says �Low Power � Warning � Signal Reception or Command
  Interpretation May Be Impaired.' Mr French clicks on a button. The message
  changes to �Charging�. Miss Scott checks the straps that hold Natalie to the
  couch. She removes the gag. Natalie is quiet now. 
�We'd better run the others through this before they hit the same problem,� Miss
  Scott says. 
They leave Natalie, resting sedated, the cable still connected, the message
  still flashing �Charging� on the screen. 
Chapter 19: Recycling 
I see numbers in my head. And I know what they mean. Some people can hear
  colours. I see numbers. Suddenly. A seven. Or a four. And I know what they
  mean. 
There aren't many numbers. Only zero to nineteen. But I see them. Bright;
  sudden; there in my mind; blotting out everything else. 
I haven't always been able to do this. It is new for me. Not long ago I couldn't
  see the numbers but now I can. I don't remember many things from before I came
  here but I do know I couldn't see the numbers. 
I can see a one. It's green. It's very bright. I know I have to find him.
  He is somewhere in the house and I have to find him. Where ever he is I have
  to go there. That's what it means when I see the one. 
I find him on the patio. Mr English is with Miss Scott and four other women.
  Three of them are wearing black shiny jumpsuits. They are wearing ski-masks
  that cover their faces; all except for their eyes - their blank, passionless
  eyes. The fourth woman is wearing white. Perhaps she is another doctor come
  to help us with our numbers. She doesn't say anything. Tape covers her mouth.
  Ropes hold her wrists and arms. She is struggling but one of the masked women
  holds her tightly. Miss Scott is holding a box. She presses a button and the
  three take off their masks. It is Crystal and Alice and Suzanne. 
Mr English asks Miss Scott, �How did it go?� 
�Very neat,� she answers. �Blanik did a good job on the scripts. It's quite
  scary to watch these three going through their paces in unison but it definitely
  works. They did the whole snatch pretty much solo. They jumped the doctor here,
  left two nurses trussed up and got the doc back to the van in ninety seconds.
  I didn't have to touch the box at all after I gave them the go code. I could
  have just sat in the van.� 
Mr English seems pleased. �So, no problems like the Waring event?� 
�There will always be a risk,� Miss Scott replies. �You cannot programme everything
  and they are only human after all. They didn't get any resistance, either.
  Everyone was terrified by them. Still, based on this trip, I reckon we won't
  have any problem equipping ourselves with new units. We just need the doctor
  to play her part.� 
The doctor doesn't look as though she is looking forward to this. Mr English
  picks up his box. I see 51. I am so happy to see the numbers, the bright, big
  numbers. She struggles to break free. Mr English grabs hold of her. He tells
  her that she had better cooperate. Her white coat and her blouse get torn.
  I think I see what must have happened to Heather's blouse, now. Mr English
  seems to like the fact that the Doctor's blouse is torn. He tells her that
  he has lots of friends who will want to take turns with her. She tries to struggle
  some more. The others look on. 
I have to take the doctor to her cell. She does not want to come but I have
  to make her. If I did not I wouldn't be doing what the numbers tell me and
  then I couldn't be happy. Surely the doctor would want me to be happy? 
It is a little later. I can see a one. It's green. It's very bright. I know
  I have to find him. It makes me so happy when I see the numbers, so happy that
  they are so bright. 
I find him in his study. He is with another man I have not seen before. He
  smiles as I arrive and turns to the man. �Well what do you think?� 
The man says, �You've solved the problem that you thought you had then?� 
Mr English shrugs his shoulders. �It wasn't too hard. Fortunately Waring did
  a good job on documentation. We sorted it out and we picked up a useful little
  programmer from the Boulder campus. She's able to programme scripts but she
  needs a lot of encouragement. I've got some other resources I can call on to
  replace her.� 
�And further units?� the man asks. 
�Not quite so easy but we'll have it cracked soon. The neurosurgery skills
  are not easy to come by although the procedure itself is apparently straight
  forward. Waring didn't have very complex facilities in back in the UK or in
  Colorado and we can replicate those. We've managed to find a competent surgeon
  and she has joined us now. It's just down to how quickly we can get her working.� 
He is holding the control box. He presses keys I see �18� pure and silver.
  I have to fetch something. �Bring us two glasses of wine� he says and I know
  what I have to do. It is so good to do what the numbers ask of me. I am so
  happy when I see the numbers, so happy when I do what they say. 
I pass them their wine. Mr English passes the box across to the other man. �Here,
  you've paid for this,� he says. �You might as well start now.� He presses a
  button. I see a zero, a pale, beige zero. I must smile and recite. �About:
  Soft Cybernetics Software Version 1.63 : Scripts Version 2.5 : Variant - Utility
  Unit�. 
The man turns to Mr English. �Utility unit?� he says. �I thought this was
  a pleasure unit.� 
�That's OK we can easily update the scripts.� 
�Ha!� He responds. �That's always the way these days. I might have known that
  with a pirate like you, I'd need a patch!� 
The two men are laughing. I wonder why? They seem happy. Perhaps they can
  see the numbers too.
