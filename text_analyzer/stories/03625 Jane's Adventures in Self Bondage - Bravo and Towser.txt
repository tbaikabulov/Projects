Jane's Adventures in Self Bondage - Bravo and Towser
Provided By: BDSM Librarywww.bdsmlibrary.com
Synopsis: A young woman living alone on a rambling old farm samples the delights of Self Bondage in the comany of two dogs!Jane took a deep breath. Everything was ready for her six hour ordeal � if that was the right word, for she was already damp between the legs at the
  thought � and she checked yet again the operation of the electro-magnetically
  operated latches which would release the padded cuffs around her wrists. A
  shadow fell across the sunlit patch in which she stood. She turned to see 'Bravo,'
  the large Alsatian that was her temporary guest. He padded in and sat at her
  side before raising his handsome, foolish head to look up at her. Continuing
  with her last minutes checks, Jane was distracted by the dog nuzzling her bare
  upper thigh for a moment before standing to sniff curiously at the cleft between
  her buttocks. 'Go away, Bravo!' she said crossly, pushing the animal away with
  her bare foot. The dog walked over to the pile of sacks he slept on with Towser
  and lay down on his belly, his long tongue lolling from his jaws, to regard
  his temporary Mistress's activities with mild curiosity. 

  Satisfied at last with her arrangements, Jane glanced around the small stone
  outhouse which served as her dog's accommodation. Of Towser, her black Labrador,
  there was no sign; he was probably away on some mysterious business of his
  own. The dogs had been fed earlier, and the huge water bowl he was sharing
  while Bravo was their guest was almost full. Hot as the morning was � and it
  promised to get hotter still � at least they would not go thirsty in the six
  hours their Mistress would be out of action. The thought of thirst reminded
  her of her own. Picking up a large bottle of fruit-flavoured mineral water
  from a corner, she drained it in a series of gulps. 

  She stood for a few moments before raising a hand to sweep a fringe of sweaty
  hair from her forehead, then glanced down at her naked body, hot and grimy
  after the four hours she'd already spent in preparation in the stuffy outhouse.
  For a moment she debated returning to the house to shower the sweaty dirt from
  her skin. With a laugh she discarded the notion and pressed a switch on the
  wall; then swiftly inserted her leather ball-gag into her mouth. After buckling
  it in position securely, in a single flowing motion she flopped down on the
  thick straw covering the stone floor. She rolled about in it for several moments
  in sheer delight at its prickliness on her bare skin before sitting upright
  and spreading her legs apart to click shut the padded cuffs around her ankles,
  firmly clamping them to the steel hasps set in the stone floor. Mindful of
  the minute or so remaining before the timer would switch on the current to
  the wrist clamps, she lay on her back and extended her arms above and to the
  side to wriggle her hands into each cuff against the weak resistance of the
  spring which barely held it closed. Settling her wrists comfortably, she waited
  for the two faint clicks which would announce that the latches had engaged. 

  They were only seconds later in coming, and she lay quite still for a moment
  with her eyes closed, imaging herself as seen from above � lying spread out
  in the form of a Saint Andrew's Cross, her limbs clamped to the ground. Then,
  as usual, she struggled deliciously with her bonds for several minutes before
  subsiding, panting with exertion, into the straw she lay on. 

  She lay still for a moment, savouring the feeling of the sweat between her
  breasts and in the hollow of her flat stomach, and, above all, the delicious
  wetness at the top of her thighs. She sighed and closed her eyes. 

  A little later she heard the sound of Bravo rising from the bed he shared with
  her dog. Turning her head, she saw him stretch, then walk out of her limited
  field of view. Seconds later she heard the sound of noisy lapping, and when
  that ended, the soft padding of his paws on the straw as he left the shed. 

  She closed her eyes again. The usual feeling of anticlimax was afflicting her;
  she longed to be able to move her arms and wipe the sweat from her grimy face,
  and the straw under her shoulders and back was now packed uncomfortably hard
  from the pressure of her weight. Already she was bored, longing for the cuffs
  to open and free her. She thought of a long, cool shower and a cold drink,
  and uttered a tiny whimper of frustration. 

  Her usual remedy of turning her thoughts to future bondage sessions failed,
  this time, to engage her interest. She had been feeling for some time that
  something was deeply dissatisfying about Self Bondage; the fun was all in the
  preparation and the immediate confinement, matched only by the relief of release.
  If she had a Partner; a (what were they called? Ah, Dominants!) how much more
  fun it would be, she thought wistfully. No more long preparations; no more
  elaborate release mechanisms! 

  She really must try � somehow � to contact a willing accomplice, she thought
  sleepily before dozing off. 

  She had no idea how long she slept, but she woke to even greater heat and humidity
  than before. In the vain hope that she had been unconscious long enough for
  the latches to have opened, she struggled to extricate her wrists from the
  unyielding clamps, only to desist in despair. Her bladder was painfully full,
  and she cursed the thirst that had led her to drink so much water immediately
  before confining her self. On previous occasions she had urinated deliberately,
  enjoying the lack of inhibitions she felt, but those had been when she'd been
  more or less upright. Now, if she opened her bladder � when she opened her
  bladder, that abused organ protested! � she'd be condemned to lie in it, maybe
  for hours. But she had no other recourse; with a little sob of disgust, she
  flooded the straw beneath her thighs and buttocks with her warm urine The copious
  flow finally ceased, and she lay back in relief, feeling the liquid dry on
  her skin where it was exposed to the hot atmosphere. But under her haunches
  the wet straw was already clammy and uncomfortable. 

  A little later, she found a new cause of discomfort to afflict her. The first
  flies of summer had discovered the turds the dogs had deposited outside their
  shed, and soon they discovered the helpless Jane. Attracted by her sticky,
  sweaty body, they began to buzz about her face and settle around the corners
  of her eyes and mouth, and she could feel the tickling of their feet as they
  crawled about on her the skin of her breasts, belly and thighs. Jane began
  to cry, weakly straining at her bonds and turning her head from side to side
  in vain attempts to dislodge the flies from her face. 

  It was Towser who rescued her. She felt a cold, damp nose in her left armpit,
  then a warm wet, rough tongue licking her hot face. Opening her eyes, she looked
  up to see her dog staring down at her with concern, his new friend Bravo in
  the background. Towser gave a little yelp of joy at these signs of life from
  his Mistress, and celebrated by licking her face vigorously. The salt in her
  sweat was evidently much to his taste, for he went on to lick her neck and
  shoulders before turning his attention to her breasts. Jane felt her nipples
  grow hard and erect under the dog's tongue, and she quivered with excitement.
  Then she felt Bravo, not to be left out, begin to lick the calf of her right
  leg industriously. He, too, found her taste attractive, and his long, rough
  tongue moved up to her knee, before beginning on her lower thigh. Jane waited
  in delighted fear as the Alsatian's tongue moved higher and high, and she gave
  out a muffled squeal as it found her genitals. There the dog found the taste
  of her vagina irresistible, for he lowered his huge head and snuffled at it
  for several seconds before beginning to lick it with increasing enthusiasm.
  Jane found herself writhing with passion under his attentions; the intense
  sexual pleasure of his rough tongue on the lips of her vagina made her bite
  hard into her leather gag to stifle a scream of ecstasy. When she climaxed,
  straining against the clamps imprisoning her limbs, she did so suddenly and
  copiously. Shuddering with reaction, she lay back in her bonds while the two
  dogs competed to lick up her outflow. Sated, she closed her eyes while the
  dogs withdrew to drink. 

  Towser soon returned. Puzzled and worried by his Mistress's silence and her
  unaccountable refusal to move from her prone position, he lay down protectively
  by her left side, his hairy flank against hers. Minutes later Bravo joined
  them. He lay down on his right side, his long chest and belly pressed against
  her side, his heavy head on he right shoulder. Obscurely grateful for their
  presence, Jane closed her eyes and slept. 

  When she woke the dogs had gone. She had no idea how much time she had spent
  in sleep, patient and relaxed, she waited for her bonds to be released. Unable
  to raise her head, capable only of turning it from side to side, she couldn't
  tell how long it would be before the timer released her. But it didn't matter;
  release would come when it came, and nothing she could do could affect that. 

  She lay there in this pleasant torpor until her natural spirits recovered themselves,
  helped by her sudden and belated realisation that today was a popular public
  holiday. There would be hikers on the moor � not many, but some � and she amused
  herself with delicious thoughts of being discovered. Closing her eyes, she
  conjured up a mental picture of herself as she would appear to such a visitor � a
  naked and attractive young woman, pinioned prone and helpless, her body spread
  in invitation to all comers to do with as they wished. Or, she thought, as
  just such a woman, her naked flesh grimy and damp with sweat and her own urine,
  the rank odour of dogs clinging to her skin. 

  But her sexual appetite was sated for the moment, and when she heard the two
  faint clicks of the latches opening she lost no time in freeing herself. After
  spending some time brushing the damp straw from her body, she left the shed
  and walked out into the afternoon, tired and spent, for her long-promised shower
  and cold drink. But she thought she would really have to find a playmate for
  the future.
