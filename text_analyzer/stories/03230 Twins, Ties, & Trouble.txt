Synopsis: Trish ties Kelly for revenge and both discover the erotic potential of lesbian bondage. Twins, Ties, &amp; Trouble &ndash; Part 1  
Trish placed $3.02 into the teenager's outstretched palm. &quot;Here's your
  change...thanks for coming in.&quot; She looked past the girl's reddish brown
  hair and saw Kelly, her best friend, go into the Videos for Hire Rental store
  across the mall walkway. Trish suspected that Kelly was interested in Jeff,
  her boyfriend, because this was the 4th time this week that she had seen Kelly
  come in to rent videos. Trish didn't have any more customers so she busied
  herself by straightening out the stock and keeping an eye out for Kelly to
  leave.  
Trish and Kelly became friends in the 3rd grade and were inseparable until
  Kelly went away to college last fall. Three weeks ago when she came home for
  the summer, Kelly spent the entire first weekend at Trish's house talking about
  old times.  
Trish noticed that Kelly had lost a little weight and told her it really
  made her look hot. Kelly blushed a little when Trish told her that she'd have
  the guys lined up to get into her pants. Kelly was about 5' 7&quot;, 125 pounds,
  with dark brown hair. Her breasts were 34B and could be described as pert.
  Kelly had always been in the top 5% of her class and was going to college on
  a full scholarship.  
Trish had been forced to stay home and go to community college this past
  year.  
Trish had always counted on getting an athletic scholarship, but an injury
  to her knee playing volleyball sidelined her during her senior year, and colleges
  decided not to take a chance on her recovering fully. Trish was a natural blonde,
  5' 6&quot;, 120 pounds, and an all around athlete. She also played softball
  and always made the all-star teams in both sports until her injury. Kelly's
  grades had always been a little better; but Trish had been more in demand socially
  because of her athletic ability, sexy body, and friendly manner. A pair of
  firm 36C breasts on her athlete's body had always made Kelly envious.....until
  now. Kelly seemed different to Trish; more confident socially, a little more
  outgoing, and now she had the body to go with the new attitude.  
 Having to stay home did have some advantages for Trish though and one of
  them was Jeff. Trish met Jeff at the mall last Christmas when she first started
  working at the music store. It took about 2 weeks before he asked her for lunch
  and 3 weeks after that they were a couple. Jeff's dad owned 3 Video Rental
  stores and Jeff managed the one in the mall. Trish and Jeff double dated with
  Kelly and Jeff's friend Mark on Kelly's second weekend back and ever since
  then Kelly has been renting lots of videos and always from Jeff's store at
  the mall.  
Trish was worried that Jeff might drop her in favor of Kelly and she was
  determined not to let that happen without a fight.  
Finally, after about 25 minutes, Kelly walked out of Jeff's store and waved
  as she left. Trish whispered to herself, "I'm going to find out what that Bitch
  is up to.&quot; Trish turned away and pretended not to notice as Kelly came
  into the music store.  
&quot;Hi Trish,&quot; Kelly called out with a big smile on her face.  
Trish turned to face her, and calmly asked, &quot;Hi Kell, what're you doin?&quot;  
Kelly held up the bag bearing the Videos for Hire logo, &quot;Just came in
  to bring back some videos and pick up a few more.&quot;  
&quot;You seem to be watching a lot of movies lately Kell, any good ones?  
&quot;You know, some good, some bad. Dad hasn't had a lot of work for me
  lately and I get bored with nothin to do.&quot; Kelly worked at home during
  the summer doing research and typing up legal papers for her Dad, who was a
  lawyer. &quot;And a couple of these are to entertain the Bradley twins tomorrow
  night.&quot;  
&quot;You're sitting for the Bradley's tomorrow?&quot;  
&quot;Yeah, it's an overnighter. They're going upstate somewhere to visit
  a brother,  
I think. Anyway, there's a new baby that they want to see and they'll be
  gone until Saturday afternoon.&quot;  
&quot;I hope it pays good, those twins can be a handful.&quot;  
&quot;That's right, you should know. You usually watch them, don't you? Oh...I'm
  sorry, I didn't mean to intrude on your territory...Mrs. Bradley stopped me
  as I walked by there this morning and asked...said it was a last minute thing.&quot;  
&quot;That's OK Kelly, I have a date with Jeff tomorrow night anyway.&quot;  
&quot;Great, that's a relief. Well, I got to go...are you coming over tonight?&quot;  
&quot;Sure, what'd you want to do?&quot;  
Kelly held up the bag again; &quot;Well, we could always watch some videos,&quot; she
  said laughing as she left the store.  
Trish muttered to herself, &quot;Yeah, or maybe we could play 20 questions
  instead.&quot;  
* * * * * * *  
The sun beat down on Trish as she walked along Oak Street on her way home.
  It was only 8 blocks and she enjoyed the exercise, it helped to keep her in
  shape, and she was determined to stay in shape. Trish played volleyball twice
  a week in an adult league and was her team's best player. She also filled in
  occasionally as a substitute on a men's fast pitch softball team. She would
  have played more, but that would take time away from being with Jeff. Trish
  turned the corner and headed up Marshall for the last block and a half. As
  she passed by the Bradley's 2 story white colonial the screen door flew open
  and 2 kids came running out and jumped off the porch, waving their arms and
  shouting.  
&quot;Trish...Trish, wait a minute&quot;  
Trish turned to face the onrushing duo just as Jill jumped at her. Trish
  caught her under the armpits and swung her around.  
&quot;No fair,&quot; shouted Brandon. &quot;Jill had a head start or I would
  have beat her.&quot;  
&quot;Of course you would have,&quot; said Trish, winking at Jill as she
  put her down.  
&quot;How're you guys doin...staying out of trouble?&quot;  
Jill's mouth scrunched up a little and she wagged her head. &quot;Well, you
  know....we're not perfect.&quot;  
&quot;Perfect enough for a couple of 11 year olds,&quot; Trish laughed, running
  her fingers through Brandon's red hair. &quot;I hear you have a new cousin.&quot;  
&quot;Yeah, Uncle Bob's wife had a baby boy,&quot; answered Brandon. &quot;How
  come we're going to be stuck with Kelly anyhow? Why aren't you watching us?&quot;  
&quot;Your mom needed an answer right away and Kelly was in the right place
  at the right time; although.....considering you two.....maybe she was in the
  wrong place at the wrong time.&quot;  
&quot;Come on,&quot; pleaded Jill, &quot;We're not that bad.&quot;  
&quot;No, you're not. I like you just the way you are. Anyway, what do you
  mean STUCK with Kelly? What's wrong with having her watch you?&quot;  
&quot;She's boring,&quot; said Brandon. &quot;She never wants to play games
  with us....all she wants to do is read stories.&quot;  
&quot;Well maybe she's different now,&quot; answered Trish. &quot;Kelly changed
  a little while she was gone; you guys might really have a good time with her.&quot;  
&quot;Do you really think so?&quot; Jill inquired.  
&quot;Yeah, I think so. I got to go now...going over to Kelly's tonight.&quot;  
&quot;What about Jeffffff?&quot; teased Jill.  
&quot;He'll just have to wait until tomorrow night,&quot; said Trish over
  her shoulder as she walked away. &quot;See ya.&quot;  
&quot;Bye Trish.&quot;  
&quot;See you tomorrow.&quot;  
* * * * * * *  
Trish stepped out of the shower and grabbed the large fluffy beach towel
  hanging on the rack. She admired her image in the mirror as she rubbed her
  body....thoughts of Jeff and the friction of the towel made her nipples harden
  and her skin flush. Turning sideways, she smiled; imagining Jeff's hands gently
  caressing the curves of her ass...his mouth and tongue stimulating her nipples...and
  then his fingers....RING-RING....damn, the phone interrupted her daydream.
  Trish tossed the towel on her bed....RING-RING....and picked up the phone.  
 &quot;Hello....Hi, I just finished showering, what's up?..........do you
  have to do it tonight?....do you want me to go with you?....OK-maybe I'll see
  you tomorrow at the Mall...bye Kell.&quot; Trish hung up the phone, laid down
  on her bed, and spoke to the ceiling, &quot;I wonder what that was all about?........oh
  well, what should I do tonight. I know......go down to the mall and buy myself
  a new outfit for tomorrow.&quot;  
 She bounced off the bed and headed for the bathroom to finish getting ready.  
* * * * * * *  
Kelly gently hung up the phone and let out a long slow sigh of relief. 'Boy,
  that was really hard...lying to Trish; but on the other hand, they say everything
  is fair in love and war.'  
* * * * * * *  
Trish walked out of the boutique clutching a bag containing her latest purchases.
  She had bought a pair of form-fitting jeans and an aqua blue top. The pants
  accentuated the shapely curve of her ass and the top was designed to show off
  her breasts. As she walked towards the exit she saw Kelly's mom come out of
  the bookstore. &quot;Hi Mrs. Martin&quot;  
&quot;Oh, hi Trish, what are you doing here?&quot;  
&quot;I bought some new clothes....why? Where should I be?&quot;  
&quot;Oh nowhere else really, I just thought that you went to the movies
  with Kelly...I guess she went with someone else.&quot;  
Trish hoped that Mrs. Martin didn't notice the flash of anger that crossed
  her face. In a split second she vowed to get even with Kelly for lying to her,
  and more than even if she was out with Jeff. &quot;I guess she must have Mrs.
  Martin. It was good to see you again. Bye now.&quot;  
&quot;Good-bye Trish,&quot; said a slightly confused Mrs. Martin. She waved
  as the doors opened for Trish's exit. &quot;I'll have to ask Kelly who she
  went with.&quot;  
* * * * * * *  
Trish was still fuming the next day as she went about checking the stock
  of CDs and Tapes at the Music Store. She had called Jeff's apartment last night
  when she got back from the Mall, but he wasn't at home. 'I'll ask him at lunch
  where he was last night. I'll tell him I called to find out what to wear tonight.'  
 At 12:30 Trish put on her best smile and went over to Jeff's store.  
She waited patiently as Jeff finished with a customer, smiling and shuffling
  her feet.  
&quot;Those are due back on Sunday at 5 PM,&quot; Jeff said, after handing
  his customer 2 video tapes. &quot;Thanks for renting from Video for Hire.&quot; He
  turned towards Trish and smiled. &quot;Hi.&quot;  
&quot;Hi Jeff, ready for lunch?&quot;  
&quot;We're kind of busy right now Trish; Molly called in sick and it seems
  like a lot of people are getting their weekend videos early....I can't leave
  the store right now....I'll try to sneak out and grab a sandwich later.&quot;  
&quot;I can bring you back something from the deli...what do you want?&quot;  
&quot;Uh, thanks for offering...but I'll just go out later.&quot;  
It was obvious to Trish that Jeff was uncomfortable talking to her and it
  wasn't just because he was busy, but she wouldn't let him off the hook. &quot;Look
  Jeff, it's no trouble at all for me and you need to eat something...just tell
  me what you want.&quot;  
Jeff's face hardened and he grabbed Trish's hand. &quot;Come in the back
  for a second.&quot; He led her in silence to the stockroom. He let go of her
  hand and backed up against the wall.  
Trish saw that he was struggling for words and wouldn't look her in the eye.  
&quot;What's wrong Jeff?...are you mad at me?&quot;  
&quot;No.&quot;  
&quot;Then what's the matter Jeff?&quot; Trish reached out and grasped Jeff's
  left hand.  
&quot;Tell me what's wrong.&quot;  
Jeff looked up and fixed his eyes at the top of Trish's head. &quot;Trish,
  I like you a lot, I really do, but...&quot;  
'If he says we can still be friends I'm going to kick him in the balls.'  
&quot;..I think we're moving too fast.&quot;  
&quot;What does that mean Jeff?&quot; Trish hoped to draw out of him what
  she already suspected.  
&quot;I think....that we need to back off a little.....you know....date other
  people for a while.&quot;  
&quot;Who in particular did you have in mind Jefffff?&quot; There it was,
  thought Trish, the Question...would he admit it was Kelly?  
&quot;Just other people...you know. You date other guys and I date other
  girls. After a while we'll know if we still feel the same about each other.&quot;  
Trish dropped Jeff's hand and stepped back. &quot;How about Kelly? I think
  she likes you...do you want to go out with her?&quot; Trish saw Jeff's eyes
  dart back and forth searching for the right answer.  
&quot;Uh....sure, why not.....she seems nice.&quot; Jeff's eyes now met Trish's
  and his face lit up. &quot;Yeah, I think I'll ask her out.&quot;  
Trish's eyes narrowed in anger causing Jeff's smile to disappear. &quot;You
  go right ahead and date whoever you want, but don't think I'm going to sit
  around and wait for you to make up your mind. When you finally figure out that
  I'm the best thing that's ever happened to you I may not want you back.&quot; Trish
  stomped out of the stockroom with one final comment, &quot;Screw you Jeff.&quot;  
Trish's hunger had vanished and she felt angry and hurt. She left the mall
  and walked to the park on the other side of Oak St, determined not to let anyone
  see her cry. She sat on a bench at the far end of the park and watched the
  wispy clouds through moist eyes. 'Jeff and Kelly....my boyfriend and my best
  friend....maybe they deserve each other....but you Kelly, you need to be taught
  a lesson about friendship, and I'm just the one who's going to teach you.'  
 Trish wiped her eyes and headed back to work with a plan of revenge forming
  in her mind.  
* * * * * * *  
 As Trish walked along Oak Street she knew that Jill and Brandon would be
  waiting for her just as they did everyday. She had put the final touches to
  her plan of revenge on Kelly and she would need the twins' help. Trish turned
  on Marshall and saw Jill and Brandon roller blading on the sidewalk in front
  of their house.  
&quot;There's Trish,&quot; shouted Brandon.  
&quot;Beat you to her,&quot; challenged Jill as she took off.  
&quot;Not this time,&quot; said Brandon as he grabbed the back of Jill's
  shirt and then shot past her in a flurry of motion.  
Trish stepped off the sidewalk so she wouldn't get run over as the twins
  raced toward her. Brandon maintained his lead and got to Trish first, but Jill
  was not far behind and crashed into Brandon when she tried to stop. Both of
  the twins fell into the grass, laughing and slapping at each other.  
Trish grabbed an arm from each twin. &quot;Now you two stop it before I have
  to spank you both.&quot;  
Jill and Brandon both looked up at Trish from the ground and in unison told
  her,  
&quot;You wouldn't dare.&quot;  
&quot;Don't tempt me. I did it before and I can do it again.&quot;  
&quot;But we were a lot younger then,&quot; said Jill. &quot;We're too old
  now to be spanked.&quot;  
&quot;If you act like immature brats, then I'll treat you like immature brats.&quot;  
&quot;Okay, we'll behave,&quot; said Brandon. &quot;Are you on your way home?&quot;  
&quot;I sure am...work's over and I'm ready for the weekend.&quot;  
&quot;And Jeff too, I'll bet,&quot; chided Jill.  
Trish leaned over so that she was at the twin's eye level and put an arm
  around each of their shoulders. &quot;As a matter of fact, there's been a change
  of plans and I'm not going out with Jeff tonight.&quot;  
Jill's eyes brightened, &quot;Then you can watch us tonight instead of Kelly.&quot;  
&quot;No, Kelly is still going to watch you, but I do have an idea that might
  be fun.  
Do you want to hear about it?&quot;  
&quot;Sure,&quot; said Brandon  
&quot;Well, do you two remember that game of cops and robbers we played last
  summer?&quot;  
&quot;I do,&quot; Jill blurted out. &quot;We arrested you and made you admit
  that you had stolen mom's diamond necklace.&quot;  
&quot;That's right, and what did you do to me so that I couldn't escape?&quot;  
&quot;We tied you to a chair,&quot; said Brandon.  
&quot;And was I able to escape?&quot;  
&quot;No way,&quot; laughed Jill. &quot;Brandon knows how to tie knots. I
  never get loose when he ties me.&quot;  
&quot;Good, cause I want you to play that game with Kelly. It's my turn to
  play a practical joke on her and this will be a good one.&quot;  
&quot;Sounds like fun,&quot; chuckled Brandon. &quot;What do you want us
  to do?&quot;  
&quot;What time are your folks leaving?&quot;  
&quot;Around 6:30 I think,&quot; answered Jill.  
&quot;Okay, great...just do normal stuff for the first couple of hours....watch
  TV, play in the yard, whatever. At 8:30 or so she'll probably suggest that
  she read to you as you go to sleep. You tell her that if she'll play one game
  with you, then you'll go to bed by yourselves without any more protests. If
  she says no, then you two need to pester her until she changes her mind. Tell
  her you won't go to sleep without playing one more game. I know that she'll
  eventually give in and say yes. When she does, play the game just like you
  did with me last year.  
The only difference is that after you have her tied to the chair I want you
  to blindfold her so she can't see me when I come in.&quot;  
&quot;Where will you be?&quot;  
&quot;I'll be across the street watching your bedroom window. When you've
  got her tied to the chair, turn your bedroom light off and on and then I'll
  come to the back door.&quot;  
&quot;Do we get to help torture her after that?&quot; asked Jill.  
&quot;No and No. You don't get to help and I'm not going to torture her...it's
  a practical joke and it's just between Kelly and me. After you let me in you
  two will go upstairs and to go to sleep.&quot;  
&quot;What are you going to do to her?&quot; Jill asked mischievously.  
Trish winked at the two of them and stood up. &quot;That's just between Kelly
  and me....one or both of us will be there when you wake up tomorrow. That's
  the plan. Will you help me?&quot;  
&quot;Sure, we'll do it.&quot; answered Brandon.  
&quot;Thanks guys, I'll see you later tonight...remember; this is our secret.&quot;  
As Trish walked away with a wide grin on her face she heard Jill shout, &quot;Don't
  worry Trish, we won't let you down.&quot;  
* * * * * * *  
&quot;May I leave the table,&quot; Kelly asked. &quot;I have to be at the
  Bradleys by 6:15.&quot;  
&quot;Sure honey,&quot; answered her mother. &quot;Just let us know when
  you leave.&quot;  
Kelly went to her room and packed clothes, books, &amp; toiletries into a
  small overnight bag. She decided to wear a green button-up blouse with beige
  mid-thigh shorts. As she packed she struggled with her conscience about what
  she had done to Trish. Jeff had called during this afternoon and told her about
  the breakup between him and Trish. Kelly felt bad for her friend, but not disappointed
  that Jeff was now all hers. Kelly tried to rationalize that it was not that
  bad since Trish had always had her pick of boyfriends while she was always
  too shy to be socially popular. It felt good to be pursued by a handsome guy,
  but she still felt bad that she had lied to Trish.  
 'Maybe I'll call her tomorrow and apologize; I sure don't want to lose her
  as a friend. Jeff's nice, but not really my dream guy....I just want to enjoy
  feeling desirable for a while.'  
* * * * * * *  
At 6:14 Kelly walked up the Bradley's driveway as Mr. Bradley came down the
  front steps carrying two suitcases.  
&quot;Hi Kelly, sure glad you were available on such short notice.&quot; &quot;Me
  too Mr. Bradley. Is your wife inside?&quot;  
Mr. Bradley set the suitcases down behind their white Taurus. &quot;Upstairs
  giving Jill and Brandon a last minute pep talk about behaving.&quot;  
&quot;Thanks.&quot; Jill went up the steps and into the front hallway and
  saw Mrs. Bradley coming down from upstairs. Jill and Brandon were sitting on
  the top step and  
Kelly waved to them. &quot;Hi Mrs. Bradley. Hi Kids.&quot; Jill and Brandon
  enthusiastically waved to Kelly and Kelly thought it odd that they seemed so
  happy to see her. In the past they seemed only to tolerate her...oh well, maybe
  they've grown up a little.  
 This might not be so bad after all she thought.  
Mr. Bradley's voice carried into the house. &quot;Come on dear, we've got
  to get going.&quot;  
&quot;Okay, I'll be right there. Sorry Kelly, everything seems so rushed
  lately.  
Thanks for doing this on such short notice, you're a lifesaver. Now...the
  kids have already had their supper, they can play outside till 8 and then they
  need to be getting ready for bed.&quot; Mrs. Bradley turned her gaze towards
  where the twins were sitting. &quot;They're to be in bed by 9 o'clock and asleep
  by 9:30. Don't give Kelly any trouble or you'll get it when we get back.&quot; She
  looked back at Kelly. &quot;That's about it, any questions?&quot;  
&quot;No, Mrs. Bradley, I think the kids and I will be just fine. You two
  go see that new nephew and don't worry, everything will be OK.&quot;  
Mrs. Bradley rushed out the door and called back, &quot;Thanks again Kelly,
  we'll be back around 1 or 2 tomorrow.&quot;  
Kelly stood on the porch with Jill and Brandon, waving as the white Taurus
  backed out of the driveway. &quot;Have a safe trip...bye.&quot;  
&quot;Well kids, what do you want to do?&quot;  
&quot;We want to play in our fort,&quot; said Brandon.  
&quot;Where's your fort?&quot;  
&quot;It's in the back yard,&quot; answered Jill.  
&quot;Okay, that's fine,&quot; said Kelly. I'll be in the family room doing
  a little reading. Stay in the backyard unless you come in and talk to me, OK?&quot;  
&quot;Sure, let's go,&quot; shouted Brandon.  
Kelly went in the house and picked out a comfy chair by the window, where
  she had a good view of the backyard. She could read and keep an eye on the
  twins at the same time. Mrs. Bradley had forgot to tell her where she should
  sleep; but it didn't really matter. After the twins were asleep Kelly would
  just pick the most comfortable couch. She picked up a recent issue of Newsweek
  from the coffee table and casually flipped pages until she found an article
  that interested her.  
Kelly could see the twins playing in the yard and the serenity of the present
  situation made her think that this night was going to be calm and uneventful.  
Time passed quickly and Kelly's eyelids were drooping when she heard the
  clock chime 8 times. She pushed herself up out of the chair and opened the
  French doors leading to the backyard.  
 &quot;Jill, Brandon,&quot; she called. &quot;It's time for you to come in
  now.&quot;  
&quot;Can't we stay out here a little bit longer?&quot; pleaded Brandon.  
&quot;No, your mother said 8 o'clock. Come on in, wash your hands, and we'll
  do something fun inside for a little while until it's time for bed.&quot;  
&quot;Okayyyy,&quot; answered Jill as the twins rushed through the doors
  and up the stairs. Kelly closed the doors and went back to her chair. She heard
  water running in the upstairs bathroom and lots of giggling and laughter. She
  smiled, thinking that it was nice that Jill and Brandon got along so well.
  About fifteen minutes later the twins came bounding down the stairs and into
  the family room.  
&quot;Well, what are you two up to now?&quot; Kelly asked. Each of the twins
  stood before her with a cap gun in their hand and a stern look on their face.
  Brandon also had a backpack on.  
&quot;We want to play Cops and Robbers,&quot; Jill told her.  
&quot;Well go ahead, just remember...it's bedtime in about 45 minutes.&quot;  
Brandon and Jill each grabbed one of Kelly's wrists and pulled her out of
  the lazy-boy. &quot;No, you have to play with us.&quot;  
&quot;Why me?&quot; chuckled Kelly. &quot;I don't even have a gun.&quot;  
&quot;Because we're the cops and we need you to be the robber,&quot; explained
  Jill.  
&quot;IF I play this game with you, do you promise to go to bed without any
  more complaining or trying to stall?&quot;  
Brandon and Jill smiled at each other and answered in unison &quot;YES.&quot;  
&quot;Okay then, how do you play cops and robbers?&quot;  
&quot;Brandon and I are the cops and you're the robber. We'll go out on the
  front porch while you hide somewhere in the house. Here, hide this costume
  jewelry first before you hide. We'll come in and search the house until we
  find you.  
Then we arrest and interrogate you until you tell us where you hid the jewelry.&quot;  
&quot;Where should I hide it?&quot;  
&quot;Anywhere you want to,&quot; said Brandon, &quot;but remember; you're
  a tough crook....don't tell us right away.&quot;  
&quot;Okay...one game and then off to bed. Should I go hide now?&quot;  
&quot;Wait until Brandon and I are outside. We'll wait for 3 minutes on the
  front porch and then we'll come back in.&quot;  
Kelly watched the front door close and headed up the stairs. &quot;Don't
  forget to lock the front door when you come back in.&quot; Kelly shouted to
  them. She didn't care if they knew she was going upstairs...she was only playing
  the game so that they would go to bed and didn't want to make it too hard for
  them to find her.  
Jill and Brandon stood on the porch and gave the thumbs up sign to Trish,
  who was in a car parked across the street. Trish signaled back to them and
  leaned back against the far door in case Kelly looked out a window. Trish was
  overjoyed that her plan of revenge was working out perfectly so far.  
Kelly was hiding in the master bedroom walk in closet. It was a reasonable
  hiding place, but it wouldn't be too hard for the twins to find her. She smiled
  and thought to herself, 'Here I am playing a kids' game with kids while thinking
  about Jeff's kisses and his roaming hands.' The front door slammed shut and
  footsteps came up the stairs. 'Maybe I'll let Jeff fuck me....it's great to
  feel sexy, it makes me feel so....so alive.'  
&quot;There she is,&quot; Brandon shouted as he spotted Kelly kneeling behind
  a suitcase in the back of the closet. He pointed his cap gun directly at her
  and commanded,  
&quot;Put your hands up where I can see em and come out of the closet...
  slowly.&quot;  
Kelly stood up and raised her hands in the air. 'These kids have watched
  too many cop shows.' &quot;You got me, but you'll never find the jewels.&quot;  
&quot;We'll see about that,&quot; snapped Jill. &quot;Turn around, hands
  against the wall, feet back and spread em. Officer Brandon, cover me while
  I frisk her.&quot;  
&quot;Geez, I'm beginning to feel like a real crook.' Kelly assumed the &quot;Position&quot; as
  they say on TV and felt Officer Jill's fingers search her from head to toe.  
'This might be real fun if Jeff were doing the frisking.'  
Jill finished. &quot;She's clean, no weapons.&quot; Jill stepped back and
  pointed her gun at Kelly. &quot;Officer Brandon, secure the prisoner.&quot;  
Twins, Ties, &amp; Trouble - Part 2:  
'Now what the hell does she mean by that?' Kelly looked over her shoulder
  and saw Jill's gun pointed at her and saw Brandon set his backpack on the bed.  
Brandon reached into the backpack and took out a small coil of rope. Kelly
  pushed away from the wall and turned to face the twins.  
 &quot;No way kids, I didn't agree to be tied up.&quot;  
&quot;You agreed to play the game with us and this is how it's played,&quot; said
  Jill.  
&quot;Prisoners are always put into handcuffs when they get arrested,&quot; explained
  Brandon. &quot;That's just the way it is.&quot;  
&quot;We don't have any handcuffs, so we use rope instead,&quot; added Jill.  
&quot;I don't know.....I'm supposed to be in charge here. How can I be responsible
  for you two if you've got my hands tied?&quot;  
&quot;Well it's only a game,&quot; chided Jill, &quot;you're not going to
  back out of your promise, are you?&quot;  
&quot;OK, I guess not, but remember, you go to right to bed as soon as this
  game is over, OK?&quot;  
&quot;No problem, but let's get back to the game while we've still got time,&quot; said
  Brandon, holding up the rope.  
Kelly put her hands together.  
 &quot;Go ahead then and secure the prisoner.&quot;  
&quot;Not that way,&quot; said Jill. &quot;Cross your wrists behind your
  back.&quot;  
Kelly flashed the twins an annoyed look and slowly turned around, crossing
  her wrists behind her. 'Boy, I don't see why Trish likes these two little monsters.'  
Brandon tied and cinched Kelly's wrists and then put his backpack back on.  
Brandon grabbed Kelly's upper left arm, &quot;Let's go to the interrogation
  room.  
We'll get the truth out of you there.&quot;  
&quot;Hey guys, this rope is really tight,&quot; Kelly grimaced. &quot;Remember,
  we're only playing....can you loosen the knots a little?&quot;  
&quot;No, we can't, &quot;said Jill. &quot;You must be tied securely until
  we find out the location of the stolen jewels. That won't take long If you
  cooperate.&quot;  
The twins led their bound prisoner down to the family room and brought in
  a straight back wooden chair from their father's study. They sat Kelly in the
  chair and Brandon produced another coil of rope.  
&quot;Now what,&quot; protested Kelly. &quot;What are you going to do with
  that?&quot;  
&quot;We can't start the questioning until we're sure you aren't able to
  run away,&quot; answered Brandon.  
'Oh god, why did I agree to this?.' &quot;Hurry up then and let's get this
  over with,&quot; grumbled Kelly. 'I'll really be glad when these two are in
  bed.' Kelly watched Brandon tie her ankles together and then tether them to
  the bottom chair rung. &quot;OK cops, you got me....I confess....the jewels
  are...&quot;  
&quot;Quiet,&quot; shouted Jill. &quot;We'll interrogate you when we're ready.
  We're in charge here.&quot;  
&quot;Then I've had enough,&quot; Kelly said angrily, twisting her wrists
  in an attempt to loosen the knots. &quot;I'm not playing this game anymore.
  Untie me!&quot; 'I'd like to tie them both to their beds.'  
&quot;The prisoner is not cooperating Officer Jill,&quot; said Brandon. &quot;What
  do you suggest we do?&quot;  
Jill pulled a blue scarf out of Brandon's backpack. &quot;Maybe a blindfold
  will quiet her down.&quot;  
&quot;No, I won't let you blindfold me.&quot; Kelly twisted her head, making
  it difficult, but after a couple of minutes Jill had the blindfold in place
  and knotted securely.  
The only sound was Kelly's labored breathing as she tried to catch her breath
  and make sense out of what was happening. Brandon and Jill gave each other
  a thumbs up and Brandon ran up the stairs to give the signal to Trish.  
Kelly was trying to remain calm. &quot;How did I let myself get in this predicament.  
OK Kelly, think.....analyze the situation......I'm not going to get loose
  on my own and the brats are determined to play this game out...so I'll have
  to play it with them and hope it ends soon. &quot;OK, I'm all right. Why don't
  you take the blindfold off and interrogate me now?&quot;  
&quot;The blindfold stays on until we know the location of the jewels,&quot; said
  Brandon as he re-entered the room. &quot;I just searched the closet where we
  found you hiding and the jewels are not there.&quot;  
&quot;Well of course not, I hid them when I heard you come in the house.&quot;  
&quot;Then where are they?&quot; demanded Jill.  
&quot;You'll never find out,&quot; sneered Kelly. 'I'll play their game for
  a couple of minutes and then spill the beans.'  
 &quot;So ya wanta play rough huh?&quot; said Brandon. &quot;We can play
  rough too.  
We can play it any way you want it, just remember, we always get what we
  want.&quot;  
&quot;Not outta me, you won't.&quot; 'Okay, one more threat and I'll tell
  em.&quot;  
&quot;She's a tough one Officer Brandon,&quot; said Jill. &quot;Maybe we
  should use the rubber hose on her.&quot;  
&quot;You can't do that,&quot; shot back Kelly. 'I wonder if they really
  would.' &quot;It's against the law.&quot;  
&quot;You forget that we're the law around here,&quot; stated Brandon. &quot;Officer
  Jill, get me the rubber hose. It's hanging on the wall outside the back door.&quot;  
&quot;Now, wait a minute,&quot; pleaded Kelly.  
&quot;Right away Officer Brandon,&quot; said Jill.  
Kelly heard footsteps and then the sound of the back door opening. A minute
  later the door closed and Jill came back in, announcing &quot;Here it is, Officer  
Brandon.&quot; Trish had come in when Jill opened the backdoor and now stood
  over by the steps leading upstairs. Trish was wearing black shorts, a dark
  blue top, and moccasins. She had a backpack with her that she sat on the first
  step. Trish then sat on the 2nd step to watch.  
&quot;Okay - I'll tell you where I hid the jewels,&quot; Kelly said nervously.
  'You've won, let's end this game.' &quot;Upstairs - in the linen closet - underneath
  the sheets.&quot;  
&quot;You'd better be telling us the truth,&quot; Brandon said sternly, &quot;or
  it'll go hard on you.&quot;  
&quot;It's the truth you little shi.....er officer,&quot; Kelly said contritely. &quot;and
  now that the game is over, will you please untie me.&quot;  
&quot;The game is over when we recover the jewelry,&quot; stated Jill. &quot;If
  you're telling us the truth then you'll be released. Come on Officer Brandon,
  let's go see if she's telling the truth.&quot;  
The twins ran up the steps two at a time and were joined in Brandon's bedroom
  by Trish. The trio were all smiles with lots of high fives to go around.  
&quot;We did pretty good, huh?&quot; said Jill.  
&quot;You guys were terrific. Now I want you both to hop into bed and get
  right to sleep. If you're asleep within 10 minutes I'll treat you to a movie
  tomorrow.&quot;  
&quot;What if Kelly asks us why we didn't come back down?&quot; asked Jill.  
&quot;Why don't you just tell her......uh, that you thought she got loose,
  because a girl with a Halloween mask on surprised you up here and made you
  go to bed. She won't know whether you're telling the truth or not.&quot;  
&quot;OK, I'll be asleep before Jill even gets into her bed,&quot; bragged
  Brandon as he laid down and pulled up the covers.  
&quot;Bet you won't,&quot; countered Jill as she ran through their bathroom
  and jumped into her own bed.  
&quot;Music will help you sleep better,&quot; said Trish as she turned on
  each of the clock radios that were beside their beds. 'It'll also help cover
  up any extra noise that may come from downstairs.'  
 &quot;Goodnight Jill...Goodnight Brandon.&quot; Trish had to wait only a
  few minutes until the twins were sound asleep.  
* * * * * * *  
Kelly waited...and waited...and waited. 'Where are they? they must have found
  the jewels by now.'  
 &quot;Brandon..Jill, come down here...the game's over.&quot;  
 Trish was standing 3 feet in front of Kelly, quietly observing her prey.
  'No, you traitor, the game is just beginning.' Trish reached forward and lightly
  flicked Kelly's nose with the tip of a feather.  
Kelly pulled her head back. 'What was that? Did they sneak back in here?'  
Something brushed against her neck and she twisted her body to get away from
  it.  
&quot;OK, this is not funny anymore. The game is over. If you don't untie
  me this instant, I'll have to tell your parents.&quot;  
Trish put the feather down and smiled as she heard Kelly's stern words. 'Bitch,
  you're not dealing with the kids anymore....I'm in charge now.' Trish reached
  into her backpack, pulled out a long brown scarf, and tucked one end into the
  waistband of her shorts. She also brought out 2 pairs of panties and rolled
  them into a ball, which she held in the palm of her right hand. 'Better be
  ready, sooner or later she's going to panic.'  
&quot;Now listen kids,&quot; Kelly pleaded. &quot;If you untie me right now,
  I promise you won't get into any .......'oh god, my blouse.' Kelly tried to
  twist away, but was limited by the tethers to the chair. The hands unbuttoning
  her blouse easily followed her and continued...2 buttons...3 buttons.  
&quot;Stop, Please&quot; She was on the verge of tears. &quot;Brandon, Jill,
  talk to me.&quot; 4 buttons...5 buttons. &quot;This isn't right, you can't
  do this. Stop, right now.&quot; 6 buttons...and her blouse was spread open,
  exposing her white lacy bra.  
Kelly's breathing was erratic as she was losing her battle to remain calm.
  Her breasts rose and fell as she gasped for breath. Trish was ready with the
  wadded up panties.  
Between gulps of air Kelly pleaded once more. &quot;If you don't........untie
  me now........I'll scream for help........and then the police will come.....Is
  that what you want?&quot; Kelly pulled on her wrist ropes again, but they still
  held tight.  
'What I want right now is to see those pretty tits of yours.' Trish released
  the front snap on Kelly's bra, simultaneously exposing her breasts and sending
  her over the edge. Kelly's scream for HELP was cut short as Trish jammed the
  panties into her mouth. In one motion Trish stepped behind Kelly and pulled
  the scarf from her waistband.  
 She placed the scarf between Kelly's lips and pulled tight, sealing the
  panties inside. The long scarf was wound behind Kelly's head and back to the
  front. Trish double-knotted the ends of the scarf between Kelly's parted lips.  
Kelly was still now, although her heart was racing and her breathing labored.  
'That wasn't either of the kids.....someone else is here. What am I going
  to do,  
what can I do? God, the kids, what's happened to the kids? I hope they're
  all right.' Kelly erupted in a flurry of motion, twisting and pulling at the
  ropes, only to fall back exhausted in defeat.  
Trish sat on the couch and watched Kelly's struggles. 'She's really scared.....and
  kind of excited too, look at those nipples.....she does look kind of sexy,
  helpless and half naked.' Trish walked silently over to the bookshelf and turned
  on the stereo, not very loud, just loud enough to mask small noises.  
'Let's see if there's any coke or lemonade in the frig.'  
Kelly's adrenalin kicked in again when she heard the music come on. Her whole
  body tensed in anticipation. 'Ok Kelly, what are you going to do? I need to
  help those kids, if they're still alive and I have to stay alive to do that.
  But I'm helpless to change my fate....I can't move and I can't talk. All I
  can do is cooperate and hope they don't hurt me. I wonder how many?'  
&quot;Mmmppphhh...mmmpppfff...ugghhhh,&quot; Kelly screamed into her gag
  as the numbing cold shot from her left nipple straight to her brain.  
Trish ignored Kelly's muted pleas to stop, circling the ice cube around Kelly's
  areola and then over to her right breast. She continued rubbing the ice across
  Kelly's chest as little drops of water cascaded down her stomach, darkening
  the waistband of her shorts. Every now and then Trish would surprise Kelly
  by tweaking one of her hardened nipples.  
 'Kelly, this is fun....for me anyway.....I wonder what you'd think if I
  took off your blindfold. Maybe you'd be sorry you stole Jeff from me. Here's
  one to cool off your pussy a little.' Trish put the last part of the ice cube
  down the front of Kelly's shorts.  
&quot;Oomph.....MMMPHHHH.&quot; Kelly squirmed in a futile attempt to get
  away from the cold, hard object pressed against her sex, slowly melting. 'God,
  just do whatever you're going to do.....quit tormenting me.' The ice melted
  quickly from the heat trapped inside her panties as Kelly's body continued
  to betray her......flushed skin, extended nipples, and now her pussy was getting
  wet from more than just the melting ice.  
'OK, Miss modest 1 piece bathing suit, now that you're kind of used to being
  half-naked, let's see how you deal with totally naked.' Trish stepped behind
  Kelly and pushed her blouse and bra straps down past her elbows. She choose
  a medium length piece of rope from her backpack and doubled it. Trish ran the
  looped end between Kelly's arms and her back, positioned the rope just above  
Kelly's elbows and inserted the loose ends through the loop. Using steady
  pressure, Trish pulled until Kelly's elbows were almost touching. 'Didn't know
  you were this limber Kell.' Trish circled her upper arms 3 more times with
  the rope and cinched it off.  
Kelly wished she still believed in magic and could wish this away, but instead
  her situation was getting worse. Her hands were becoming a little numb and
  now her shoulders felt the strain of having her elbows forced together.  
Trish untied Kelly's wrists after tethering her elbow tie to the top rung
  of the chair back.  
Kelly did not resist as she felt her blouse and bra straps being pulled down
  past her hands. She was grateful for the feeling that creeped back into her
  hands intermingled with the familiar tingling.  
Trish looked down at Kelly's breasts, thrust forward due to the position
  of her shoulders, and felt a warm tingling inside of her. She reached down
  and cupped Kelly's breasts in her hands. She heard a small gasp from Kelly
  as she gently traced around the reddish-brown areolas.  
Kelly reached back with her hands and touched her captor's legs. 'They're
  smooth, it's a girl....it had to be....oh God, that feels good......what am
  I saying, I'm being felt up by another girl....oh I don't care anymore, it
  just feels so good.'  
 As if on cue, the stranger pinched Kelly's nipples, and a lightning bolt
  went straight to her very wet pussy.  
Trish could see that Kelly was rushing towards an orgasm and didn't want
  to give her that pleasure just yet. She abruptly quit massaging Kelly's breasts
  and after she heard a definite groan from Kelly, retied her wrists. Trish then
  tied a rope just above Kelly's knees before releasing the tether that had held
  her to the chair. After untying Kelly's ankles, Trish helped her stand up and
  then backed away to watch her tentative movements.  
Kelly flexed her ankles and walked in a small circle. With no sight and her
  legs tied at the knees, she was still very much a prisoner.  
Trish sat on the couch and admired the view. 'You know Kell, your tits look
  a lot bigger this way. Maybe I should call Jeff and have him come over. I wonder
  whether he'd untie you or fuck you first.' A few minutes passed as Trish watched
  Kelly testing her bonds, trying to relieve the strain on her shoulders.  
 Trish saw Kelly heading straight for the lazyboy and fell in step behind
  her. When Kelly gently bumped into the foot of the chair she turned herself
  around and Trish choose that moment to grasp the waistband of Kelly's shorts
  and panties. Kelly squirmed in a fruitless effort as Trish pulled them down
  to her knees. Trish forced Kelly to kneel and then made her lie on her stomach.
  Trish untied Kelly's knees and removed the last of her clothes. She slapped
  her on the butt and turned her over, forcing her to lie on her bound arms.  
 'Very nice pussy, Kell....neatly trimmed and.....(sticking 2 fingers inside
  Kelly).....so very wet.....you're getting off on this.'  
Kelly was almost glad that the blindfold prevented her from having to look
  her captor in the eye. She felt more embarrassed than she had ever felt before
  in her life, and also more turned on. It was easier this way, to be used in
  a way that would have repulsed her before. She wanted the probing fingers to
  continue to work on her clit, slide in and out, in and out until she exploded
  in orgasm.  
'I don't know who she is and I don't care anymore.'  
What Kelly wished though, was not what Trish was there for. After several
  thrusts into Kelly's pussy, Trish stopped, and retrieved her pile of ropes.
  She crossed Kelly's ankles and tied them. She lifted Kelly up until she was
  kneeling and tightly wrapped rope above and below her breasts.  
 Laying her down on her back again, Trish now examined Kelly's exposed pussy.
  Trish of course had seen many other women naked in the showers after an athletic
  event, but never before had the opportunity to examine another girl's pussy
  so freely. Her fingers danced through the wispy light brown pubic hairs arranged
  in a neat triangle, pointing to Kelly's slit. Her fingers rubbed Kelly's puffy
  labia, glistening with the juices of her arousal. One finger slid inside and
  teased Kelly's clit as the air was heavy with the musky smell of sex.  
Trish's eyes saw Kelly's breasts, framed by rope and topped by hardened nipples,
  rise and fall as her passion grew.  
 Trish felt her own passion grow as she continued to finger fuck her best
  friend. Trish wanted to stop, but was driven on by a lust she couldn't control
  any more. She lifted Kelly's legs and crawled underneath. With Kelly's legs
  resting on her shoulders, Trish covered Kelly's mound with her mouth and drove
  her tongue into Kelly's pussy.  
Kelly was still technically a virgin. She dated a little in high school and
  had let a couple of boys feel her tits, but nothing else. Last year at college
  she dated Chad for 4 months and he was able to finger fuck her a few times
  and went down on her once. Kelly had found it enjoyable even though she was
  unable to climax. To satisfy Chad's insistence on sex, Kelly jerked him off
  several times, but when that failed to appease him and he became more demanding,
  she broke up with him. But this was different, she had no choice, no decision
  of right or wrong. The tongue that was intimately exploring her pussy was strong,
  yet so gentle. The feelings coursing through her body were unfamiliar and wonderful.  
Trish abandoned all self control as her right hand found it's way inside
  her panties and 2 fingers dipped into her own pussy. Her tongue was driving
  Kelly to an orgasm while she played with her own clit. Kelly's body suddenly
  stiffened and she groaned with pleasure through the gag as wave after wave
  of relief swept through her. Seconds later, Trish bit her lip to stifle a scream
  as her fingers gave her the climax she desperately wanted. As the sensations
  subsided, Trish fell to the floor, completely spent, letting Kelly's legs rest
  on top of her.  
After several minutes, Trish recovered and resolved to finish her plan.  
 'I don't hate you anymore Kell.....in fact I think we both could be even
  closer.....but I can't let you know yet that it was me.....I'm kind of sorry
  and glad this happened. Doesn't make sense, but that's how I feel.'  
Kelly lay exhausted, happy, naked, and bound. After a brief rest, her captor
  turned her over and attached another rope to her wrists and looped the other
  end around her ankle ropes.  
Trish pulled tight on the rope and tied it off at Kelly's wrists, forcing
  Kelly into a severe hog-tie. When Kelly grunted through her gag, Trish patted
  her on the butt and sensuously traced the curve of Kelly's ass with her fingertips.  
When Kelly responded with soft moans, Trish turned her on her side and continued
  to play with her. Trish sucked on Kelly's left tit and ran her fingers between
  Kelly's thighs and up to her bush.  
 She teased Kelly by playing with her pubic hairs and then thoroughly lubricated
  her index finger by dipping it into Kelly's pussy. As she gently bit and rolled
  an areola in her mouth, she pressed her finger against Kelly's anus, and pushed.  
&quot;YES, I'm ready, again......I'm ready, I can come again......NO, NO,
  NOT THERE....oh my god, my ass......&quot;  
 Kelly tightened her muscles as much as she could , but soon Trish's well
  lubricated finger slipped into Kelly's rectum.  
 &quot;Jeez, it's in my butt...oh god no...OH...OH...OHHHH, that feels GOOD....yes,
  yes, yes, YESSSSSS....oh god...OH GODDDDD!!'.  
Kelly's body lay limp; recovering from her 2nd orgasm, when she heard a click-whirr
  mixed in with the music. &quot;That was a strange noise....there it is again...I
  wonder...oh god, it's a camera.'  
 &quot;UUMmmmpp...MMmmmph,&quot; was all she could say as she struggled to
  avoid the camera's eye.  
Trish simply moved around snapping picture after picture. 'Great stuff Kell,
  we'll call this series 'What I did during summer vacation'. Pull on the ropes,
  look anguished, good...good... great.'  
Kelly realized the futility of her struggle and came to a rest face down.  
Several small tears were quickly soaked up by the blindfold.  
'Pictures.....photographs of me, like this, naked and tied up.....it's not
  just tonight, it's forever.....who's going to see those photos?.....who's going
  to have those photos?.....this is a nightmare.'  
Trish inspected the room and carefully packed her backpack with anything
  that might point to her as the intruder. She tiptoed up the stairs and checked
  on the twins and found them sleeping peacefully. She crept back down to the
  family room and stopped at the entrance and looked at her hog-tied friend.
  'This sure was a night, wasn't it Kell? I'll have the photos to remember it
  by and you'll have your memories, but maybe someday I'll share the photos with
  you and you can share your memories with me. I've got to go in a minute....I'll
  see you tomorrow at the park.'  
Trish kneeled next to Kelly and removed the rope holding her ankles to her
  wrists, and then she removed the ropes forcing Kelly's elbows together. Kelly
  sighed with relief as her shoulders slumped forward and her legs straightened
  out. Trish untied the knots on the upper body ropes and tucked the ends under
  the other ropes. Lastly, she untied the knots on the rope holding Kelly's wrists,
  tucking those ends under and over the other strands of rope. Trish lovingly
  caressed Kelly's ass one more time, then picked up her backpack and quickly
  vanished through the backdoor.  
Kelly was afraid to hope that it was over. She heard the backdoor open and
  close and still she laid quiet. Several minutes passed and she pulled on her
  wrists and felt the ropes loosening. She twisted her wrists and pulled again
  and they were free. Kelly worked her arms around to the front of her body and
  sat up. By dipping her head Kelly was able to pull the blindfold from her eyes.  
 As she got used to the light, Kelly looked around and was astonished to
  see that everything in the room looked the same as it did before......with
  only one exception, her. Kelly pushed her arms out to the side and the chest
  ropes loosened and gave way. Kelly removed her gag and untied her ankles, rising
  to a wobbly stance. She picked up her clothes, which had been left in a neat
  pile on the couch, and unsteadily made her way to the downstairs bathroom.  
She put her clothes on the counter, wrapped a large towel around her, and
  ran upstairs to check on the twins.  
 Finding them sound asleep, she returned to the bathroom and stared in amazement
  at her image in the mirror. Rope marks and red blotches from rolling around
  on the carpet were everywhere on her body. Both sides of her mouth were red
  and crinkled because of the tight gag. She held her wrists up and could still
  see the rope pattern circling them. Kelly also saw a different woman than the
  woman that came over earlier that afternoon. This new woman had went through
  agony and ecstasy and now viewed her sexuality in a new and wonderful light.
  She hated that pictures of her were taken, but she also hoped that someday
  she could see those pictures. She wanted desperately to tell someone, to share
  with someone, what had happened .....but she knew that she would be too embarrassed
  to talk about it.  
 Kelly stepped into the shower and relaxed in the stinging spray of hot water.  
 Brandon and Jill came running down the stairs at 8 AM and found Kelly asleep
  on the couch in the family room.  
&quot;Wake up sleepyhead, it's morning already,&quot; shouted Brandon.  
&quot;Yeah,&quot; agreed Jill, turning on the TV. &quot;It's time for cereal
  and cartoons.&quot;  
Kelly looked at them through drowsy eyes. &quot;Go easy you two, I didn't
  get a lot of sleep last night.&quot;  
&quot;What's the matter? asked Jill. &quot;Did you have a nightmare?&quot;  
Kelly sat up and stretched. &quot;What happened to you guys last night after
  I told you where the jewels were hidden. Why didn't you come back down right
  away and untie me?&quot;  
&quot;Sorry about that,&quot; apologized Brandon. &quot;We thought it would
  be funny to leave you tied up for a while so we wouldn't have to go to bed
  right away.&quot;  
&quot;But you sure made us pay for that little mistake,&quot; Jill said as
  she rubbed her bottom with her right hand.  
&quot;Made you pay? What do you mean?&quot;  
&quot;You really scared us when you burst through the door wearing that Jason
  Mask,&quot; said Jill. &quot;I almost wet my pants.&quot;  
&quot;We know we deserved it,&quot; admitted Brandon. &quot;but that was
  the first time we've been spanked in at least 2 years, and it hurt.&quot;  
&quot;How did you get loose?,&quot; asked Jill. &quot;Brandon must be slipping
  with his knots.&quot;  
Kelly's mouth opened but nothing came out for several seconds.  
&quot;...............I'll tell you later. Why don't you get some breakfast
  and let me rest a little longer.&quot;  
&quot;Sure, let's go Jill,&quot; said Brandon.  
Kelly sat with her knees drawn up to her chest and watched the twins as they
  ate their breakfast in front of the TV. 'It seems like a dream, yet I know
  it was real; so very, very real. Are those brats telling me the truth? I don't
  know, they are accomplished liars.....but their story is plausible, it might
  be the truth. If it is the truth then they don't need to know any more. If
  they're lying, then they probably know who kept me tied up, who tormented me,
  who pleasured me in a way I've never known. If they know, I want to know....but
  I can't ask them. I can't talk to my parents; I'd be too embarrassed and they'd
  probably want to call in the police or the FBI. I might be able to talk to  
Trish, maybe she could...................... TRISH.............I wonder?'
