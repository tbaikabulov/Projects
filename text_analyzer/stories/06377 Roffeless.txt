ROOFELESS

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I had my future all planned out.&nbsp; Sciences, pre-med, I was going to rack up the credits, do the straight and narrow, and be a doctor.&nbsp; Seven figure income, two car garage, vacations in Hawaii.&nbsp;&nbsp; Funny, how I ended up here on my knees in a place like this.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I wasn't really dating much at University.&nbsp;&nbsp; I was hot, with full firm breasts and a nice tight ass in that nubile beach-teen kind of way, shoulder length honey blonde hair, a nice close cropped pussy.&nbsp;&nbsp; I knew it, and I even liked showing off within reason, with nice tight jeans and T-shirts.&nbsp; I didn't dress like a slut, but I dressed so you knew I was sexy.&nbsp; I didn't mind getting a second look.&nbsp;&nbsp; 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Hot, but not getting any.&nbsp; Studies consumed a lot of my time, and I really didn't want to mess around with a relationship.&nbsp; I don't know.&nbsp; Maybe I just didn't meet the right guy.&nbsp; But the whole dating scene just seemed to consume too much energy.&nbsp; I was horny as hell.&nbsp; My fingers got very busy.&nbsp; But all the rest of that stuff...&nbsp; I couldn't see doing keggers with the frat boys, or watching football jocks practice.&nbsp; I was just too busy with my own stuff and I didn't really have spare time for all the relationship bull.&nbsp; I mean, if I could just call someone, they'd come over, fuck me, and go away and I wouldn't have to deal with all the personal crap... that would have been great.&nbsp; But obviously, I couldn't do that or I'd get a reputation as a slut.&nbsp; 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I didn't mind partying once in a while.&nbsp; It was great to just relax and unwind.&nbsp; And hey, if I wound up in some drunken tumble then that wasn't a big deal, happened to everyone.&nbsp; You're not a slut if its just some party thing... provided you don't do it too often.&nbsp; Once in a while is chemistry, you know what I'm saying.&nbsp; Regularly is skanking it up.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Anyway, I was at this party, chilling out, relaxing.&nbsp; I was slightly drunk, but not that much.&nbsp; I seemed drunker than I actually was.&nbsp; That's probably why he made the move he did.&nbsp; And probably why I spotted it.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There was this weasely guy, tall and skinny, with a sort of rat face.&nbsp; You know the type?&nbsp; Scraggly facial hair and receding chin and a big prominent nose.&nbsp; Doesn't take enough baths.&nbsp; Sunken chest, and gangly frame.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He slipped something in my drink.&nbsp; I spotted it out of the corner of my eye.&nbsp; Yes, he'd definitely slipped something when he thought no one was looking.&nbsp;&nbsp; He hung around, waiting.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Fine, I thought.&nbsp; I picked up my drink, put it to my lips, pretended to swallow, but just getting a bit on my tongue.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There was the faintest bitter taste.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Roofies?&nbsp; I thought.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This weasel was slipping me a date rape drug?&nbsp; What was this, the eighties?&nbsp; How clumsy.&nbsp; How obvious.&nbsp; I thought about it, pretending to take another drink but carefully wiping my mouth to make sure I had no more contact.&nbsp;&nbsp; When he looked away, I poured the drink into an cigarette butt covered beer can.&nbsp; That problem solved.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He noted the empty drink, seemed to smile, and got closer to me.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Was this guy for real?&nbsp;&nbsp; That was just pathetic.&nbsp;&nbsp; All I had to do was say one word and the jocks around here would take him outside and turn him into a pretzel.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But I didn't say a word.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Why?

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I'd foiled his dastardly plot.&nbsp; He was harmless.&nbsp; It was funny, even.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I decided to play along and see what he did next.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;After a few more minutes of watching me, he came over and introduced himself.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Hi," he said, "I'm Colin."

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Colin the pathetic loser, I thought, smiling at him.&nbsp; Colin the date rape roofy artist.&nbsp;&nbsp; I smiled, affecting my best bleary, half-drunk pleasant manner, and tried to decide whether he reminded me more of a weasel or a rat.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Hi," I said, smiling.&nbsp; "I'm Barb."

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"How you doing?"

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I giggled at the obviousness of it.&nbsp;&nbsp; What were the symptoms of roofies, I tried to recall: Reduced attention span, diminished coordination, mild intoxication...&nbsp; Memory impairment of course.&nbsp;&nbsp; But the symptoms when it was actually affecting you...&nbsp; I let my gaze drift off into space.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Doing good, I see," he said.&nbsp; "Mind if I join you?"

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Oh what a smooth operator, I thought, allowing myself to giggle again, as he slid onto the couch beside me.&nbsp;&nbsp; He smiled, showing uneven teeth.&nbsp; The only reason he had the guts to come near me was because he thought he had me drugged.&nbsp;&nbsp; He was so transparent, it was unbelievable.&nbsp; It was amusing.&nbsp;&nbsp; I decided to play along, at least for a while.&nbsp; Tease him, lead him on, and drop him before things went too far.&nbsp; I'd have to put the word out about him.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I smiled, thinking of his impending comeuppance.&nbsp; How would I do it?&nbsp;&nbsp; Denounce him in the middle of the crowd?&nbsp; Or just leave him hanging?&nbsp; I imagined the look on his face when his drugged out sex puppet suddenly turned into a very lucid, very sober, very angry feminist avenger.&nbsp; He'd be finished of course, unable to show his face around at parties.&nbsp; Branded as a sleazeball rape artist.&nbsp; I pretended to giggle at something he said.&nbsp; He stroked my bare arm.&nbsp; Oh, he was in for such a surprise.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;So I played along.&nbsp; It wasn't hard.&nbsp;&nbsp; Just act a little more drunk, a little more out of it.&nbsp; If anything, I was increasingly sober and attentive, watching coldly and carefully.&nbsp; It really was acting, like playing a part.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I found I liked it.&nbsp; He made lame small talk, and I went along with it, laughing inwardly at his clumsy double entendres.&nbsp; He was so lame.&nbsp; He stroked my arm again.&nbsp; I touched his hand.&nbsp; He let his knee brush my leg.&nbsp; Slowly, he was putting the moves on me, watching for any sign of resistance.&nbsp; I moved too quick when his hand lingered on my knee, and he backed off quickly.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Oh no, no, I thought.&nbsp; Don't be shy.&nbsp; Come further into my trap.&nbsp; I made myself relax, lean back, giggly and apparently out of it.&nbsp; Carefully, his hand crept up on my knee.&nbsp;&nbsp; To encourage him I let my legs fall open.&nbsp; It was okay to spread my legs a bit, I was wearing tight blue jeans.&nbsp; I'd have never done it in a skirt, but blue jeans?&nbsp; Pfft.&nbsp; I was safe enough.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It encouraged him.&nbsp; His hand slipped a up above my knee.&nbsp; Not far up my thigh at all, but definitely there, exerting a slight but steady pressure.&nbsp; I let my knees part a little further.&nbsp; He was very close to me.&nbsp; His head dipped towards me.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Oh god, he was going to kiss me.&nbsp; Okay, I thought, game over.&nbsp; I'm not going to kiss this freak.&nbsp; But even as I was deciding that, his lips clumsily brushed my face.&nbsp; Oh fuck.&nbsp; A flicker of expression crossed my face.&nbsp;&nbsp; He froze, wondering if he'd outpaced the drugs he thought were in my system.&nbsp; 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Moment of decision, I thought quickly.&nbsp;&nbsp; I could sober up, slap him and walk away.&nbsp; It wasn't quite the perfect scene, the perfect humiliation of him, that I'd fantasized about.&nbsp; Or play along a little more?&nbsp; I was having fun playing along.&nbsp; I didn't really want to kiss him, but I wasn't really kissing him... it was acting.&nbsp; The more I lead him down the path, the bigger his fall.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He was watching me nervously, I could practically see sweat breaking out on his forehead.&nbsp; He looked ready to cut and run.&nbsp;&nbsp; How pathetic was that?&nbsp; He thought he had me drugged, but he still didn't have the guts.&nbsp; What a scared little rabbit.&nbsp;&nbsp; Deliberately, I let my eyes go half lidded and vague, put on the trace of a smile, and leaned back a little, relaxing.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Satisfied, he moved in, his lips pressing almost confidently against mine.&nbsp; In another moment, his tongue pushed into my mouth.&nbsp;&nbsp; When his hand crept up my blouse to cup my firm breast, I was ready for it, even giving a tiny theatrical moan.&nbsp; A tiny moan, I didn't want to overplay it.&nbsp;&nbsp; And all the time that his tongue was clumsily probing my mouth, I was deliciously plotting his destruction, every transgression of my body would be paid back in spades.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I returned his kisses, let him bring one hand further up my thigh, spreading my legs a little further, almost intellectually curious to see how far he would go.&nbsp;&nbsp; And there was another reason: I was wet, I realized.&nbsp; As I shifted my hips, I felt the slight delicious pressure of my tight jeans and panties against my crotch.&nbsp; My nipples were hard.&nbsp; I was slightly flushed, slightly aroused.&nbsp;&nbsp; Part of it was his clumsy pawing, but not that much.&nbsp; A bigger part was my own enjoyment of my own acting, playing the role of a drugged out slut, the lack of control, the freedom to just experience.&nbsp; And part of it was the excitement of actually being in control.&nbsp; I could shut him down at any time, I could destroy him utterly, and that was exciting... he thought he was running the show, but he was a stupid little mouse and I was the cat.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;His hand slipped under my blouse, under my bra, pushing it up and pinching a hard nipple between thumb and forefingers.&nbsp; I tried to push him away without being too obvious, but I couldn't, I had to pretend to be uncoordinated and drugged, so my hands fluttered uselessly, as he explored my breast, cupping the bare flesh.&nbsp; He clearly thought I was too drugged out for much resistance, and ignored my feeble pushes.&nbsp;&nbsp; His other hand confidently settled on my crotch, kneading it, parting my legs.&nbsp; He was practically on top of me, his mouth covering mine, extinguishing my protests.&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh, he was good, I decided, he knew what he was doing, in complete control of his drugged victim, subtly cutting off her ability to struggle or protest.&nbsp; He'd done this before, I thought.&nbsp; His clumsy awkwardness had given way to a certain smooth confidence.&nbsp; Too bad it had to be with helpless victims.&nbsp;&nbsp; I was no helpless victim, I knew I could throw him off with a hard shove.

But...

But I liked his hand on my crotch, I could feel myself automatically pushing slightly against his palm.&nbsp; My nipples felt hard and tight, my stomach tingled with arousal.&nbsp; I ached a little at the thought of calling this charade off, oh it would be satisfying, but the sexy fun part would be over.&nbsp; And I was enjoying his pathetic domination, his emerging aggression, maybe it wasn't really threatening, but I realized I had this little tiny submissive streak, and I was enjoying letting him have his way.&nbsp; I mean, even to let a loser like this touch me was a little degrading, sort of exciting in a dirty kind of way, and he was doing a lot more than touching me.

So I let it go on, playing my role, pretending to be out of it, and letting him feed my arousal.&nbsp; I didn't even have to do anything, just play along.&nbsp; It was so easy.&nbsp; I giggled again, until he clamped his mouth harder on mine, extinguishing it, and invading me with his tongue.

But one thing that was bothering me more and more as he got bolder, was the people around.&nbsp; I mean, people knew me.&nbsp; Nobody knew I was drugged or apparently drugged.&nbsp; And here I was making out with this total loser.&nbsp; It was a party, you saw all sorts of shit, but you know... I didn't really want too much attention.&nbsp; I had my reputation to consider, and getting tongued and pawed by pathetic geeks really wasn't flattering.

I kept deciding to end it, throw him off and crush him.&nbsp; But each time I almost made that decision, well, he'd push against my pussy, or stroke my breast or pinch my nipple that would distract me and make me squirm a little, and I would think, oh just a tiny bit longer.&nbsp; And it went on...

Then he pulled away from me, leaving me gasping and longing a little.&nbsp; His spittle was on my cheek, my bra pushed up under my half unbuttoned blouse.&nbsp; I could feel my panties were wet.

"Let's go upstairs," he whispered, pulling on me.&nbsp; It wasn't a request, I could feel that.&nbsp; It had the subtle touch of a command.

A girl on roofies isn't thinking, whatever thought, whatever impulse you suggest, she's likely to go along with it.&nbsp; Control her movement.&nbsp; He was gently pulling me up to my feet.&nbsp; I pretended to wobble, and faked a giggle, still playing the part.

"Upstairs," he whispered, drawing me unsteadily up.

Now?&nbsp;&nbsp; I thought.&nbsp;&nbsp; Sober up.&nbsp; Make a scene.&nbsp; Humiliate and destroy him.

"Upstairs," he whispered, making it ever so subtly an order.

I swayed.

"Okay," I said, and giggled.

It was a total impulse.&nbsp; Caution to the winds, and all that.&nbsp; The truth was, I was horny.&nbsp;&nbsp; And at least we were getting out of sight of everyone.&nbsp; I mean, I was definitely not going to fuck him. No way. Uh uh.&nbsp; On the other hand, I wouldn't mind groping a bit, it was fun and I had nothing against prolonging the fun.&nbsp;&nbsp; Especially if I wasn't doing it out in plain sight of everyone, I mean geez, reputation to think of.&nbsp;&nbsp; Heavy petting in public with this loser?&nbsp; Not good.

And besides, if I made a scene... well, no one here knew I as on roofies, or apparently on roofies.&nbsp; So it would just be, you know, a scene.&nbsp; It just didn't seem satisfying enough.

I wasn't really worried.&nbsp; If it came down to it, I was pretty sure I could beat him up.&nbsp; He struck me as pretty timid with girls who weren't drugged out.&nbsp;&nbsp; All I had to do was harsh up and he'd run away scared.

So we made our way upstairs, me leaning on him, giggling, playing the drugged out slut bimbo.&nbsp; I amused myself pretending to lose my balance, forcing him to stagger around carrying me.&nbsp; I wandered or lunged off in other directions on impulse, forcing him to guide me back where he wanted me.&nbsp; It was a game, frustrating him.&nbsp; I was having fun, a sense of sly adventure that mixed with my horniness.&nbsp;&nbsp; There was no threat at all.&nbsp; I felt completely relaxed and in control.

So by the time we actually got up to the room, I had decided to fuck him.

Oh, I wasn't proud.&nbsp; Again, it was an impulsive decision.&nbsp; Who gave a shit?&nbsp; He thought he had me drugged, he wasn't going to go bragging about it.&nbsp; This sort of thing happened all the time at parties, and we'd all seen uglier match ups.&nbsp;&nbsp; And I was horny.&nbsp;&nbsp; So what if I used him, letting him think he was using me.&nbsp; I could spit in his face the next time I saw him.&nbsp; But for now, I was in the mood and playing a role... it would be perfect to play it right to the end, to surrender to it, to abandon myself, to absolve of all responsibility...&nbsp; I could fuck him, mindless, and if anyone ever asked or wondered, well, it was the roofies, so who gave a shit.&nbsp; It wasn't Barb lowering her standards.

His tongue invaded my mouth, hands nakedly on my breasts, knee thrusting between my legs against the wall.&nbsp;&nbsp; Possessive and possessing, in control, and I enjoyed it, letting myself be wet and willing, limp and wanton.

Finally, he lead me into the room.&nbsp;&nbsp; The lights were soft, there was a dirty mattress in the middle of the floor, the walls lined with frat junk, kegs, posters, desks.&nbsp; Someone's dorm room.

And men.

A half dozen men.

At first I thought Colin, being a loser, had just lead me into the wrong room.&nbsp; I giggled and swayed.&nbsp; What would he do?&nbsp; Retreat in embarrassment?&nbsp; Try to drag me.&nbsp; This might be the perfect time to lower the boom, these guys would really fuck him up for trying to slip girls roofies at their party.&nbsp; Or would he show some guts and try and get them to leave?&nbsp;&nbsp; I wanted to see what he'd do next.

Instead, he simply dragged me towards the mattress, laying me on it gently and unbuttoning my blouse to fully expose my breasts.&nbsp; Hadn't he noticed them?&nbsp; Was he that horny that he just hadn't registered.

"Who're theesh guys," I carefully slurred, waving my arm around aimlessly.

"Shhh," he said, "they're nobody."

"She's pretty out of it," someone whispered.&nbsp;&nbsp; Someone else shushed him.

What was going on?&nbsp; I squirmed, still playing the role, playing half aware, uncoordinated.&nbsp; Colin unbuttoned my jeans, started struggling to pull them down the swell of my hips.&nbsp; I didn't have to do much more than let my weight rest to make it hard for him.

"I can't believe he got her up here," someone whispered.&nbsp; "Look at those tits.&nbsp; What a piece of ass.&nbsp; I can't wait to have a piece of that."

"Love them roofies," someone whispered.

Oh fuck, I thought, not dropping the role.&nbsp; This isn't just a date rape, this is a gangbang.&nbsp; A thousand thoughts went rushing through my head.&nbsp; Had I made a terrible mistake?&nbsp; Had a played along too long?&nbsp; Was I going to be gangraped?&nbsp; What if I screamed?

But I was still aroused.&nbsp; I tried to think.&nbsp; I mean, I was ready to be fucked.&nbsp; I was playing the role.&nbsp; Suppose I just kept going along.&nbsp;&nbsp; Every girl has fantasies of doing a gangbang, we just don't ever admit it.&nbsp; You can't.&nbsp; You do something like that or even talk about it, you're totally branded as a slut.&nbsp; You can't even do it in secret, what's a secret?&nbsp;&nbsp; Guys talk.

Except that they wouldn't talk.&nbsp; They couldn't.&nbsp; They'd brag to each other.&nbsp; But admit to anyone else that they'd gangbanged a girl out on roofies?&nbsp;&nbsp; Immediate rape charges.&nbsp; They've be drummed out of university, careers over, possible jail, total disgrace.&nbsp;&nbsp; No, they'd do it, but as far as they were concerned, it would be as if it never happened.&nbsp; And they were counting on me not remembering.&nbsp; I could have a wild gangbang, explore a deep dark fantasy, and totally get away with it.&nbsp;&nbsp; No stories, no ruined reputation.

What decided me, was that they were all better looking than Colin.&nbsp; A lot better.&nbsp; I wouldn't have minded a drunken fuck with any one of these guys.

So... why not?

Colin got my jeans down over my hips and pulled them off my legs.&nbsp; I kicked feebly.&nbsp; He pushed my legs aside.

"Socks," I muttered.&nbsp;&nbsp; He took my socks off, leaving me naked and exposed, my pussy wet and ready.

"Gonna fuck theesh guys too," I muttered, waving vaguely.

Colin spread my legs, his hands firm.&nbsp; His cock was rampant, he was well hung.&nbsp; He reached out, squeezing my breast, pinching the nipple.&nbsp; I squirmed under him, my hands fluttering beneath his belly, stroking his cock.

"Shhh," he ordered.

"Ohkay," I mumbled, deliberately submissive.&nbsp; "Allofem."

"She's ready," someone whispered, his voice tight and high with excitement.&nbsp; Instant erection.

Colin slowly slid his big hard cock into my wet cunt, forcing a drawn out gasp of pleasure from me.&nbsp; The first real sound I had made all night.&nbsp;&nbsp; A second later, my stomach tightened nervously as I realized he wasn't wearing a condom.

I'd had sex lots before, but always with a condom.&nbsp; For the first time in my life, I was being fucked bareback!&nbsp; And then he began a firm deep stroke, and the pleasure rippled through me.&nbsp; It felt so good to feel his bare cock inside me.&nbsp; Too late to do anything about it now, I thought.&nbsp; It would break character, and I couldn't break character.&nbsp; His thrusting increased to a pounding, his hands digging into my breasts.&nbsp; My back arched, hips pushing to meet him.&nbsp; My legs wrapped around him.

I was being fucked hard.&nbsp; Oh I was being fucked by this pathetic loser who thought he had me drugged, who probably could only get a date if the woman was drugged.&nbsp; And he was fucking me in front of everyone.&nbsp; Oh it was so degrading, and it felt so good.&nbsp; And they were going to fuck me too, taking turns, all of them watching my debasement.

I was almost ready to come when I felt Colin's cock swell up inside me, felt it getting hard and ultra rigid, felt his body stiffen.&nbsp; Then for the first time in my life I felt a mans cock ejaculate inside my fertile walls.&nbsp; Oh god, I hoped I didn't get pregnant.&nbsp; Oh god a little more and he'd make me come.&nbsp; He was pulling out.&nbsp; Oh no, don't.&nbsp; Fuck me a little more.&nbsp; Please.&nbsp; I reached down and made hard fierce circles around my clit.

Colin got off me.&nbsp; My body was suddenly cold with drying sweat.&nbsp; I mewed, writhing, as I dug my fingers into my drenched pussy, feeling his semen oozing from me.

But I wasn't alone for long.&nbsp; Another man knelt in front of me.&nbsp; Willingly, wantonly, I spread my legs, opening my cunt to him.&nbsp;&nbsp; He thrust inside, fucking hard and within minutes I had my orgasm, screaming out pleasure.&nbsp; As he pounded my helpless body, and I gasped in post orgasmic throes, a rough hand seized my hair, and I found myself drawn, face impaled on a hard cock.&nbsp; There were more hands on me, I couldn't tell whose.&nbsp; Even as I felt myself lost in sensation, I felt my cunt tightening, the cock inside me pounding relentlessly on my g-spot, pushing me steadily towards my next orgasm.&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh god, I thought.&nbsp;&nbsp; And I surrendered completely.

Again and again my pussy was filled with sperm.&nbsp; My cunt used hard.&nbsp; I felt bodies on me, above me.&nbsp; I was moved, propped on all fours and taken from behind, then from front and back.&nbsp; I buried my face on a soft cock later, moaning as I was fingered, until someone was ready to fuck me.&nbsp; They all had me, my mouth, my cunt, my tits, I was drenched with their sweat, skin tingling from their grips, as they came in me or on me again and again.

Finally, they were finished, and I laid limp on the filthy mattress, exhausted, fucked out.&nbsp;&nbsp; I lay there, letting my exhaustion pass for some drug induced haze, watched them stand or walk around me, their brutal, well used cocks hanging between bare legs.&nbsp; Their come oozed from my hard punished, fucked out, cunt.

"She still out of it," someone asked.

"Yeah, till tomorrow," Colin said.

"And she's not going to remember?"

"Not at the dose I gave her, not a fucking thing."

"Good.&nbsp;&nbsp; Now get her out of here.&nbsp; I don't want her waking up here."

"Fuck yeah," someone else said.

There was something delicious about the way they talked about me.&nbsp; Degrading.&nbsp; As if I wasn't there.&nbsp; As if I wasn't anything more than a cunt.&nbsp; Half consciously my hand drifted down to stroke my clit.

"Look at her go," a voice said, "what a fucking slut."

I blushed, the humiliation adding to an inexplicable arousal.

But the pleasure, as insidious as it was, didn't last.&nbsp;&nbsp; 

I shivered as Colin knelt between my legs, and a wash of cold liquid surged up inside me.&nbsp; I whimpered and struggled, staying in character.&nbsp; Colin easily held me in place as he worked.

"What the fuck are you doing?" someone asked him.

"Cleaning her up.&nbsp; Douching her.&nbsp;&nbsp; She's got like a dozen loads of come in her.&nbsp; You want her to wake up tomorrow, wondering why all this come is oozing out her pussy?&nbsp; She'll figure things out pretty fucking fast."

"Oh."

"Besides, we don't want her getting knocked up.&nbsp; That would also be a pretty fucking obvious tip."

He was so rude to these guys.&nbsp; I hadn't thought he had it in him.&nbsp; But now, in the aftermath, he was... professional, in control.&nbsp; Everyone was standing around, but he was taking care of business.&nbsp; Even as exhausted as I was, I wasn't drugged, and it was almost fascinating.&nbsp; Almost.&nbsp; I was really tired and not paying attention at the time.&nbsp; But his quiet dominance must have impressed me on some level.&nbsp; I let him clean me up.&nbsp;&nbsp; Laying passive, using my apparent drugged out state.

"Do you have to do it here?"

"I could do it on her living room carpet, and she can wonder where the stain came from."

"Just hurry it up and get her out of here.&nbsp; Get her out the back way, we don't want anyone seeing her."

"Teddy?"

"Yeah, I'll help, Man."

Teddy seemed to be the shorter, fatter one.&nbsp; His cock had been stubby but thick.&nbsp; He'd had a hairy body, and big heavy balls that had spurted and spurted inside me.

"Okay, here you go," Colin said, pulling the jeans up my legs.&nbsp; Together they got me dressed.&nbsp; Colin dug into my purse until he found my ID.&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh, oh, I didn't really like the idea of him knowing my last name, or where I lived.&nbsp; But it was too late to break character now.

Between the two of them, they got me down the back stairs, handling my deliberately limp frame, and into a car.&nbsp; Then up to my apartment.

"Nice place," Ted said.

"Yeah," Colin replied, as they guided me towards my warm, welcoming bed.&nbsp;&nbsp; I fell onto the clean sheets.&nbsp; They smelled so good, so unlike the coarse fabric of the semen and sweat stained mattress.

"Look around," Colin said.&nbsp;&nbsp; "Does she wear pajamas?&nbsp; A nighty?"

He proceeded to carefully and gently remove my clothes.

"Can't find anything," Ted said.

"Keep looking."

I didn't want them turning the whole place.

"Jess panties," I mumbled.&nbsp; "Thash all..."

"Thanks," Colin whispered.&nbsp;&nbsp; He had my jeans off, my blouse.&nbsp; Carefully he undid my bra.&nbsp; I burrowed into the sheets.

"Oh she's fine," Ted whispered.&nbsp; "I gotta get a picture."

A picture?&nbsp; No way.&nbsp; Pretending half consciousness, I pulled the sheets around me.

Colin pulled them away, exposing my breasts.&nbsp; Uh uh.&nbsp; I turned on my side, throwing an arm up.&nbsp; "Go ..way," I mumbled.

Colin tried to roll me on my back.&nbsp; I mumbled and fluttered angrily, pulling the sheets awkwardly.

"Oh fuck it," Colin said, "we fucked her good, that's enough.&nbsp; We don't need evidence around to convict us."

"Fine," Ted sulked, putting away the camera.&nbsp;&nbsp; They got up and went to leave.

But just before they left, Colin came back and kissed me on the cheek.&nbsp; He thought I was unconscious, but I felt it.

As the door locked, my adventure ended, and I allowed myself to fall into blissful, sated, orgiastic sleep.&nbsp;&nbsp; I felt victorious.&nbsp; Untouched.&nbsp; Satisfied.&nbsp;&nbsp; I didn't know it, but it was the beginning of my downfall...






 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;














R0FFELESS, Chapter two



The next morning following my apparent gang rape, when I was used and abused by a half dozen horny studs who had pounded my poor little pussy unmercifully... I felt great!&nbsp;&nbsp; I was elated.&nbsp; I felt sexually charged and powerful.&nbsp;&nbsp; I'd fulfilled one of those private little fantasies of women, and completely consequence free.&nbsp; My reputation was intact, none of them were ever going to say anything.&nbsp; 



I wasn't dating much, so most of my sex life was masturbation.&nbsp;&nbsp; As a result, I had a lot of fantasies, lots of dirty ones I'd gotten off on.&nbsp;&nbsp; How many gangbang fantasies had I gotten off to?&nbsp; I didn't want to say, but more than a few.&nbsp; Black gangbangs, white gangbangs, prison gangbangs, frat boys, you name it.&nbsp;&nbsp; Not that I was obsessed with gangbangs, they were just one set of fantasies in the deck of cards.&nbsp; There were a lot, depending on moods.



I'd had my cake, and eaten it.&nbsp; Or should I say, had my cocks and ate them.



It was like a real fantasy come to life, with all these visceral touches.&nbsp; The slightly different smells of the men, the textures of their skin and hair, the dampness and coarse fabric of the mattress.&nbsp;&nbsp; They'd come in me, and I found I'd really gotten off on that.&nbsp; Perhaps the danger of disease or pregnancy made it more intense, you know, more risky and exciting.&nbsp; Or maybe the spontaneity of it.&nbsp; Or perhaps an exciting degrading quality.&nbsp; I loved the dirtiness of it, the nastiness that woke my inner skank.



And I'd outsmarted them too.&nbsp; That was part of it.&nbsp;&nbsp; I wasn't the victim, I just played one on television.&nbsp; Behind the horny, mindless, drug addled slut they thought they were fucking, had been a horny, cool, collected, brilliant slut who had actually been fucking them.&nbsp;&nbsp; Who was really the fucker and who the real fuckee.&nbsp;&nbsp; They didn't realize it, but they'd been taken.



So, obviously, I was feeling good.



Sure, I'd taken some risks.&nbsp; It could have gone badly, I could have been beaten or raped or worse.&nbsp; Or gotten pregnant, or contracted a disease.&nbsp; But no, I was in the clear. On top.



I suppose it could have ended there.&nbsp; I could have been the gambler who collected her winnings and sashayed out of the Casino.



But when does that ever happen.



Thought so.



What happened next was that I ran into Colin.



That wasn't terribly remarkable.&nbsp; It's a big campus, but its still a campus.&nbsp;&nbsp; There's a few spots, where if you hang out long enough, practically everyone passes by sooner or later.&nbsp;&nbsp; I sort of hung out at a few of those spots, which was okay, because they were hanging out kind of spots.



It wasn't that I was looking for him, you have to understand.&nbsp;&nbsp; I mean, he was such a loser.&nbsp; And he was a sluggo date rapist.&nbsp; That's not the kind of guy you search for.&nbsp; But he had been a key agent of a very powerful experience, a wild and triumphant experience, for me.&nbsp; So, you know how it is, I didn't mind sort of keeping an eye out.



"Oh hi," I said, smiling.&nbsp; Clear eyed, focused, just the sort of thing he hated in a girl.



"Uh hi," he said, startled.&nbsp; He wasn't used to girls talking to him.&nbsp; Much less ones he'd drugged and gang raped.&nbsp;&nbsp; He was blushing.&nbsp; He looked trapped, like he just wanted to bolt.



"Do I know you," I asked him.



"Uh... no.... don't think so.&nbsp; I gotta be goi "



"Colin right?"



Deer caught in the headlights look!



"Uhh...."&nbsp;&nbsp; 



Oh God, I felt like laughing right in his face.&nbsp; He was so clueless.&nbsp;&nbsp; Completely stuck for an answer and speechless, he was pathetic.



"Yes," I continued, "Colin!&nbsp; That's it!&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm Barb, remember?&nbsp; We met at that party."



"I guess..."



"I got so shitfaced at that party.&nbsp; I swear, after a while, I just don't remember a thing.&nbsp; I don't even remember getting home, I was so drunk."



"Oh well," he said clutching desperately, "you got pretty drunk...&nbsp;&nbsp; But it wasn't that bad."



"A girlfriend said she saw a couple of guys helping me get home.&nbsp; One of them sounded like you.&nbsp; Was it?"



He started to sweat.&nbsp; Were there witnesses?



"Uhm...&nbsp; Yeah, sort of, I guess."



I grinned.



"Well thanks," I said and took his hand.&nbsp; "I'm glad you were there.&nbsp; I mean, without you, god knows what might have happened to me."



This hand had spread my legs firm powerful grip, fingered my cunt, squeezed my breasts like overripe melons.&nbsp; It had wrapped its fingers in my hair and yanked my head back as he fucked his cock into my face.&nbsp;&nbsp; And now, standing in front of a real woman, he was limp and boneless.



I could see he was still processing at half speed.&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh this guy needed a chip upgrade for sure.



"Your welcome," he stumbled.&nbsp;&nbsp; "Just... you know... trying to be a nice guy."



A nice guy who tried to drug me and then shared me out to gangbang.&nbsp; My pussy tightened at the thought, a sudden surge of wetness.



"Well, a lady appreciates a gentleman,"



A fiendish impulse took me, and I pecked him on the cheek, 'accidentally' brushing my breasts against him.&nbsp;&nbsp; 



"Well," I said with as much sunny cheer as I could manufacture, "I gotta run.&nbsp; Hope to see you around.&nbsp; Bye."



"Bye," he said.&nbsp; He was definitely quick on his feet.&nbsp; Took him hardly any time to think that one up.



I skipped off, barely able to contain rich, uproarious laughter.&nbsp;&nbsp; Later, with the memories refreshed, I masturbated furiously at home.&nbsp; There's nothing like playing with fire.&nbsp; Even if it was just a damp smokey squib like Colin.



I wondered if I'd have to look him up again.&nbsp; But we ran across each other a couple of times after that, quite naturally...&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, probably not naturally.&nbsp; I think a sober girl who talked to him was a once in a lifetime event, and he wanted more.



We went for coffee, became friendly.



Come on, don't you really want to know what the sort of loser who slips girls roofies is really like?&nbsp; What goes on in his excuse for a brain?&nbsp;&nbsp; Even just a little curious?



I kind of was.



Turns out, not much.&nbsp;&nbsp; Colin was sort of a slacker, bit of an underachiever.&nbsp; He played D&amp;D, had geek friends, wore bad clothes.&nbsp;&nbsp; He was studying psychology, with an option to go into psychopharmacology.&nbsp; It was amazing how little there was to him.&nbsp; How timid and shy and ineffectual he was.&nbsp; I was the only girl in his circle of friends.&nbsp;&nbsp; I didn't mind that.&nbsp; He was so eager to be around, he was like a puppy.&nbsp; A frightened, obedient, eager to please puppy.



After a while, he introduced me to Ted.



"Have we met before?"&nbsp; I asked a man whose thick, hard cock had drenched my fertile, helpless cunt with three big loads of sperm.&nbsp; Whose thickness had made me grunt like a pig.&nbsp; Whose thrusts had flattened me into the mattress.&nbsp;&nbsp; 



"I don't think so," said Ted.



"You seem familiar," I said, shaking his hand.&nbsp; It had a good strong grip.&nbsp; I'd known that grip on my knees, as he'd fucked my face, holding my head viselike as he'd lunged his cock down my ravaged throat.&nbsp;&nbsp; He seemed shorter and less imposing now that I was not on my back, or my knees, or on all fours.



"I have that kind of face," he joked.&nbsp;&nbsp; "Familiar.&nbsp; Everyone thinks they've met me."



"And frame?"&nbsp; I laughed.&nbsp; I flashed on the hairy body under his shirt and pants, the thick matts of hair that had coated his thighs and slid against my smooth ass as he'd thrust brutally into me.&nbsp; The way his hairy stomach and chest had felt on top of me as he'd fucked me in front of everyone.



"I guess," he blushed.&nbsp; He was definitely nervous, shy that I might have made him for real.&nbsp; Or maybe it was genuine guilt over facing a woman he'd raped?&nbsp; How much convincing had Colin done for Trf to meet me.&nbsp; It wasn't as deliciously funny as my encounter with Colin.&nbsp; But Tom was nervous and uncomfortable enough, hung up between secrets and guilt, that I still had fun.



After that we were a threesome.&nbsp;&nbsp; Not a sexual threesome, puh-lease.&nbsp; No, this was beauty and her two geek pals.&nbsp; We'd hang out now and then, relax, have a pizza.&nbsp; Watch a video.&nbsp;&nbsp; That sort of crap.&nbsp; They were always good for a boring Tuesday evening when I didn't want to hang out with real friends.



And it was fun, watching them jump around nervously, pretending they'd never fucked me, and at the same time, they clearly, oh so desperately wanted to fuck me again, but they were too chickenshit to make an actual pass.&nbsp; They were like little eunuchs.&nbsp; I enjoyed teasing them now and then, 'accidental' little brushes, or peeks of cleavage, or looks at my ass... nothing dramatic.&nbsp; But I could tell they'd get hard, even though they couldn't admit it.&nbsp;&nbsp; Once, Colin even had to excuse himself to jerk off in his bathroom, while I pretended I had no idea.&nbsp;&nbsp; What losers.



So of course they'd try again.



And honestly, what other reason did I really have to bother hanging out with them at all?&nbsp; I mean, they were so inferior to me, so far beneath me, it wasn't even funny.&nbsp; There'd been the novelty of what they'd done, but that only took things so far...&nbsp;&nbsp; As I said, when you get to know a drug rape artist... its not like there's all that much there.



It was over at my place.&nbsp; They'd brought a DVD and pizza and beer, and we were just hanging out.&nbsp; It was one of those Tuesday nights that I didn't feel like spending with real friends.&nbsp;&nbsp; They were so clumsy I actually spotted them slipping it into my beer bottle.&nbsp;&nbsp; I was watching for it, knew it might come, but still...&nbsp; Talk about obvious.



No big deal.&nbsp; I switched away the bottle, replaced it with an uncontaminated one while Ted was in the bathroom and Colin distracted.



My pulse was racing.&nbsp; I was a little surprised they'd had the guts to try it here, right in my home.



I found I was scared.&nbsp;&nbsp; I mean, I was alone here with them.&nbsp; Back at the party, there'd been people all over the place.&nbsp;&nbsp; All I had to do was shout, or even stand up.&nbsp; I had been safe, right up to the moment where I decided to spread my legs for all those men, I'd been free to decide to spread my legs for all those men.



But now?&nbsp; I was a little nervous.&nbsp;&nbsp; I was alone with them.&nbsp; There was no one to help if I shouted.&nbsp; But then, weren't they cowards, I told myself.&nbsp; If I shouted, if I got angry or really pushed back, they'd freak out and fold up.&nbsp;&nbsp; They were only doing this drug shit, I reminded myself, because they didn't have the nerve to actually make a real pass at a woman.



So... play along, I thought.&nbsp;&nbsp; That was what I'd been waiting for, wasn't it?&nbsp; For Colin to try this again.&nbsp; To recapture some of that fun, to be on top.&nbsp; I didn't have to fuck him.&nbsp; I'd play act, and if it got uncool, well, I'd just show them the door and they'd leave.



Once I settled into role playing, a lot of the nervousness melted away.&nbsp;&nbsp; There was still a chill pit in the center of my stomach, but it made things exciting, that sense of real danger, of real risk.&nbsp; Mostly, I focused on playing the part of a girl falling under the influence of roofies.



How fast would it work, I wondered.&nbsp; I didn't want to ham it up with the symptoms.&nbsp; That would tip them off.&nbsp;&nbsp; How do roofies work?&nbsp; How fast are they?&nbsp; Am I roofed out enough?&nbsp;&nbsp; Am I too roofed out?&nbsp;&nbsp; It's not as easy as you think.



I was taking my cues from them, without trying to be obvious.&nbsp; I could tell Colin was watching me like a hawk, while doing the whole 'pretending not to watch.'



So, slowly but not too slowly, I just allowed myself to get giggly and vague.



I must have done okay.&nbsp; Colin excused himself to go to the bathroom, and when he came back, he sat on the couch with me, right next to me.... ever so casual, but watching for me to respond.&nbsp; I just giggled and settled against him.&nbsp;&nbsp; His hand shifted to my knee.&nbsp;&nbsp; Then moved a little up my thigh, parting my legs a little.&nbsp; But just a little, I was wearing a skirt this time, and the feel of his hand on my stocking clad leg, the edge of his palm pushing up the skirt slightly, was intoxicating and frightening.&nbsp; I got a little wet, had a few butterflies, though outwardly, I pretended not to notice.



"Hey Ted," he called, "why don't you sit here with us.&nbsp;&nbsp; Right Barb?"



I giggled and nodded, and soon Ted's weight settled on the couch on the other side of me, leaving me wedged between the two men.&nbsp;&nbsp; I could feel the heat of their bodies on either side of me.&nbsp; The shapes of their hips.&nbsp;&nbsp; It was intimidating, but also exciting to be between two malenesses.&nbsp; I had to fight an impulse to grab their crotches possessively.



Colin was talking to me steadily, making small talk.&nbsp; Asking questions.&nbsp; The questions and talk got simpler and simpler, his voice soft and repetive.&nbsp; Was he trying to bore my clothes off?&nbsp;&nbsp; Or maybe this was some hypnosis shtick he'd picked off the back of a magazine?&nbsp; I mean, it was so transparent it was amusing.&nbsp;&nbsp; 



Carefully, I dialed down, making my answers and responses briefer, simpler and vaguer, pretending to pay less and less attention.&nbsp;&nbsp; Boldly, I let my hand fall over Ted's upper thigh, almost breaking character with a giggle over his instant boner and obvious discomfiture.



Colin's hand moved slowly back and forth from my knee up the inside of my thigh, pushing my hem up past my stocking.&nbsp;&nbsp; Every time he moved his hand up, he pushed my legs a little further apart, and I let him, resisting but letting that resistance fade.&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, his fingers brushed my pussy through my panties, my hips rocked ever so slightly, and I sighed.



"She's under," Colin said.



Was I?&nbsp; I wondered.&nbsp;&nbsp; How did he judge that?&nbsp; I wanted to ask, but instead, I could only stare straight ahead at nothing in particular, being vague, pretending I hadn't heard.&nbsp; His fingers continued to brush lightly against my pussy.



"How can you tell?"&nbsp; 



Thank you Ted, I thought.



"She's unresponsive," he said, "unfocused.&nbsp; You can tell cognitive processes have basically shut down."



Yeah, I thought.&nbsp; Talk like a psych major.&nbsp; Pay attention to pussy processes.&nbsp; The tip of his finger pressed into my panties, parting my lips, working up and down.&nbsp; I squirmed.



"What do you mean?"



"Roofies depress cognitive processes," he said, "disrupts memory formation.&nbsp; She's literally stopped thinking on her own.&nbsp;&nbsp; Watch this."



He whispered in my ear.



"Barb..."



"Mmmm," I responded.



"Barb.&nbsp; Show us your tits, you want to show us your tits, Barb" soft, but clear and commanding, an order.



Yes Massa, I thought sarcastically.&nbsp; I giggled.&nbsp; "Hey, wanna see my tits."&nbsp;&nbsp; Pushing them up and out, but not opening my top.



"See?"&nbsp; Colin explained, "She's not really thinking on her own.&nbsp;&nbsp; There's nothing upstairs.&nbsp; It's an empty room.&nbsp; If you put something in her head, she thinks its her own idea.&nbsp; The machinery is still there, she's conscious, but not driving.&nbsp; Very suggestible."



Interesting, I thought.&nbsp;&nbsp; It gave me some ideas.



"Watch this?"&nbsp; Colin said.&nbsp; He snapped his fingers right in front of my face.&nbsp; "Hey!"



I couldn't help myself, I jumped.&nbsp; Focused.&nbsp; Stared.&nbsp; Then carefully, let myself sink back in the role.



"Who am I Barb?"



Should I know this.&nbsp;&nbsp; I thought probably.&nbsp; It was roofies, not amnesia pills.



"Colin."&nbsp; I giggled.



He looked satisfied.&nbsp; Score for me, I thought.



"And him?"



"Ted."&nbsp; Giggle.



"What's this label say?"



"Coors."



He covered it.



"What did the label say?"



"Coors."



He was such a fucking psych student.&nbsp; It was pathetic.



"Can I touch her tits?"&nbsp; Ted asked.



Oh finally!



"Sure," Colin said, "but no sudden movements, that'll startle her and concentrate her attention.&nbsp; Just easy and steady, and she'll go along with it.&nbsp; She'll do anything."



Ted's hand slid under my blouse, settling against my ribs and slowly stroking upwards.&nbsp; I arched my back slightly, to make it easier for him, hopefully without being obvious.



"She's responsive to basic stimulation," Colin said.&nbsp;&nbsp; Ouch!&nbsp; I guess it was obvious after all.&nbsp; "But cognitive processes are down, so she's not really distinguishing your touch from her own body right now.&nbsp;&nbsp; That's good."



Ted's hand pushed my bra cup up and off, cupped my firm breast, the nipple hard under his fingertips.&nbsp;&nbsp; Not distinguishing his touch from my own body, right?&nbsp;&nbsp; Good.&nbsp; I moaned and squirmed slightly, reached up and pressed my blouse, squeezing his hand on my breast.



"Wow!" said Ted.



"Responsive, like I said," Colin replied.&nbsp;&nbsp; "Watch this..."



He held up the beer, hand over the label.



"Barb, What's it say?"



Trick question?&nbsp;&nbsp; That was pretty fucking obvious.&nbsp; But then again, I was supposed to be drugged out on roofies.&nbsp;&nbsp; So....



"Cannnn' see."



"But what's it say, do you remember?"



The answer was obviously implied.&nbsp;&nbsp; Memory formation impaired?&nbsp; Would I really forget a label I'd just identified minutes before?



"Donnn' nooo." I slurred.&nbsp; Should I slur, I wondered?&nbsp; I was roofed out, not drunk.&nbsp; He didn't seem to object though, so it must have been okay.



"See?" he said.&nbsp; "No short term memory, no memory formation.&nbsp; Isn't that cool."



"She remembers our names," Ted said.



"Sure, those are formed memories, already there."&nbsp; He explained.&nbsp; "But she won't be forming new ones."



He slapped my face hard.



"Hey!"&nbsp; I snapped.



"It's okay, it's okay," he soothed.&nbsp;&nbsp; After a moment or two of stroking my arm, he told Ted, "See.&nbsp; She's already forgot, it's as if it didn't happen."



"So we can fuck her up?"



I didn't like the sound of that.



"No, it focuses her, she responds, it can get out of hand.&nbsp; She doesn't need memory formation to fight or freak out.&nbsp; And if we hurt her, the memory might fade, but the pain won't and she'll continue to react to that....&nbsp; A really strong emotional reaction, like terror, she'll keep on feeling scared even if she's not remembering why she's scared, she'll just apply that to anything.&nbsp; Hey Barb, hon, how's your cheek feel?"



"Stings." I sniffled.



"How come?"



"Dunno," I replied.



"You see," he said.&nbsp;&nbsp; 



He kissed my cheek.&nbsp; "There, all better."



As he did that, his finger wormed under my panties and slid into my wet cunt.&nbsp; A gasped, twitched and then relaxed into it, allowing my legs to spread further, as he pushed the panties away from my cunt.&nbsp;&nbsp; I congratulated myself on my performance.&nbsp;&nbsp; His little psych lecture helped me fake it even better. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Not the wetness, of course, not the sexual pleasure, the arousal, the slightly jolt of submission and surrender of having my body entered.&nbsp; That was real.



It was the mindless drug reactions that I faked.&nbsp; But even those were liberating.&nbsp; It was liberating to just spread my legs and get fingered.&nbsp;&nbsp; There was no baggage, no politics.&nbsp; I could just relax and enjoy being meat, surrender to pleasure and sensation.



As Colin fingered me, Ted pulled himself up on the couch, looming over me.&nbsp; Pulling on my hair, he drew my head back and forced his mouth on mine, his tongue entering me.&nbsp; His hand, pulled out from under my blouse, shoved down my top, dislodging buttons, exposing disheveled breasts and hard nipples.&nbsp; His fingers stroked the nipples, pinched them, bringing a moan from me into his mouth, and then his hand travelled down to my crotch, his fingers pushing up against Colin's, and mashing clumsily against my clit.&nbsp; I spread my legs willingly now, arching my pussy forward.&nbsp; 



Two hands on my cunt.&nbsp; It was wild.&nbsp; It wasn't like both my hands together.&nbsp; No, these were two bodies, the hands not coordinating, but like separate live things, pushing, clashing, drawing awareness in two different ways.&nbsp; Hands on my body, all over, it was hard to focus, sensations layered on sensations.&nbsp; Colin ducked his head, and took a nipple between his teeth, biting it just hard enough to make me whimper.&nbsp; 



"Oh she's ready," Ted whispered, breaking away from the kiss, leaving me gasping.&nbsp; "I'm going to fuck this bitch in half."



"Let's get her clothes off," Colin said.&nbsp; Together, they half struggled me out of my clothes, already half undone.&nbsp;&nbsp; Giving me orders to bend this way, move here, so they could undress me more easily.&nbsp; I giggled and complied, pretending to be half out of it, just awkward enough to make it a little harder for them.



Finally, I was naked, being pawed by two horny guys.&nbsp;&nbsp; I reached for their cocks, being careful to be just slightly clumsy.&nbsp; Ted's was already out of his pants, and he guided my face onto it.&nbsp; "Suck it bitch."&nbsp; He ordered.&nbsp; Submissively, I complied, relaxing into his control.



Any lingering nervousness was gone.&nbsp; Now it was just excitement.&nbsp; The excitement of sex, of being hot and dirty, of breaking rules.&nbsp; Good girls didn't get it from two men at once the way I was going to.&nbsp; It was wild and nasty.... and totally secret.&nbsp; In the end, it would be like it had never happened, they could never admit it, talk about it.



And the best part was that deep down, I was in control.&nbsp; I wasn't the drugged out cunt they thought I was.&nbsp; I was aware, watching, calculating every move, reveling in my deception, my wantonness, my superiority to them.&nbsp;&nbsp; Deep down, I was in control.&nbsp;&nbsp; Whatever they did, they only did because I let them.&nbsp; I could end it any moment. 



They didn't take me into the bedroom though.&nbsp; Instead, they played with me on the couch.&nbsp; Ted straddling me, feeding his cock into my face and making me gag slightly, while Colin worked two and then three fingers into me.&nbsp;&nbsp; I didn't mind



Colin pulled on my ankle, twisting my body.&nbsp; My mouth left Ted's cock as he turned me over, positioning me over the arm of the couch.



"I'm going to fuck this bitch up the ass," Colin announced.



My blood went cold.&nbsp; I gave no outward sign, but my stomach tightened.&nbsp;&nbsp; I was an anal virgin.&nbsp; I'd never done it that way.&nbsp; Once, a boyfriend had tried it, but it had hurt too much trying to get it in and I'd said never again.&nbsp;&nbsp; Colin was a lot bigger down there than that boyfriend had been.



Fuck, I thought.&nbsp;&nbsp; I wasn't ready.&nbsp; I didn't want this.&nbsp;&nbsp; What's wrong with just regular sex.&nbsp; Look, I'm wet, I'm horny, I'm spreading my pussy and sucking cock.



"I want this ass," Colin said.&nbsp;&nbsp; "I think she's cherry.&nbsp; I'm going to pop it."



He pressed his cock against my asshole and pushed.



"Nooo..."&nbsp; I moaned, pretending to be half out of it.&nbsp; "Not there."



He didn't take his cock away from my endangered sphincter.



"It's okay, Barb," he spoke soothingly.



"She doesn't want to, man," Ted said nervously.



"Who cares what she wants?"&nbsp; Colin snapped.&nbsp;&nbsp; My blood ran cold again.&nbsp; 



"Grab her," he ordered.&nbsp;&nbsp; "If she screams, clamp her mouth.&nbsp; Once I'm in her for a little while, she'll get used to it.&nbsp; It'll be like she's always had it there.&nbsp;&nbsp; No memory formation, remember.&nbsp; She won't remember me ramming her, she'll just know I'm up there."



Ramming.&nbsp; I didn't like that.&nbsp;&nbsp; I was going to have to break character.&nbsp; Call it off.



"What if she doesn't like it?"



"Doesn't matter, she won't remember it, five minutes after I'm finished."



Except I would remember it.&nbsp; Except it was going to hurt like hell.&nbsp;&nbsp; I struggled feebly, trying to stay in character and get out of this.



"Nooo..." I wailed.



He pushed his cock hard against my anus, and it hurt like fuck.&nbsp;&nbsp; I squealed and jerked around, but Ted held me fast.&nbsp; He was much stronger than me.&nbsp; My heart was racing.



What if I broke character, and they didn't stop?&nbsp;&nbsp; What was to stop them from just outright raping me.&nbsp; I mean, that's what they thought they were doing, right?&nbsp; Raping me with drugs.&nbsp; Well, I was naked and held down and spread out, why should they stop?



And if I did reveal... what would that do?&nbsp; Tell them I was a slut who was willing to pretend?&nbsp; Willing to have sex with two men?&nbsp; Or a half dozen?



I wouldn't remember him slapping my face.&nbsp; I wouldn't remember him trying to force his way in, and it hurting.&nbsp;&nbsp; I wouldn't remember anything.



I concentrated, trying to relax my body, trying to wash away the memory of the terror of violation.&nbsp; Relax, I told myself.&nbsp; Go limp.



"It's working," Ted said, "she's forgetting."



Asshole, I thought.&nbsp; But still, I forced myself to relax.&nbsp; Play it through, I told myself.&nbsp; It will be okay, just play it out.



Colin stepped up behind me, his hand on my ass.&nbsp; I stiffened and then forced myself to relax, consciously relaxing even my anus.&nbsp; Colin dabbed lubrication around my sphincter, causing me to tighten involuntarily, before once again, I forced relaxation.&nbsp; He slid his finger in, working around the anal ring.



I needed more than that.&nbsp;&nbsp; Ask for it?&nbsp;&nbsp; No, too obvious.



"Mmm," I muttered.&nbsp;&nbsp; "Feels nice...."



"See," Colin said with brutal satisfaction, "she likes the finger already.&nbsp;&nbsp; She's going to be an ass slut when we finish with her."



I didn't think so.&nbsp; I didn't think so at all.&nbsp;&nbsp; But he added more lubrication, working it in and around.&nbsp; I made a contented sound to encourage him, and still more.&nbsp; Two fingers slipped in, stretching my anus, working round and round.&nbsp;&nbsp; I struggled to relax myself, heart pounding at the thought of my imminent violation.&nbsp; Don't panic, I told myself.&nbsp; 



Finally, I felt his cock head, now well lubricated itself, pressing up against my slick, slippery anus.



"Easy," I muttered, as close to instruction as I dared.



"It's okay baby," Colin soothed, "I'll go real slow."



He pressed.&nbsp; And built pressure slowly.&nbsp; I tightened against it.&nbsp;&nbsp; No, I told myself, if I tighten, he'll tear me.&nbsp; Have to relax.&nbsp; No way out.&nbsp; I had to submit, to go with it and hope it wouldn't hurt too much.&nbsp; I prayed for it to be over fast.



As I relaxed, I felt the pressure build, the force of his cock pushing hard, tearing me.&nbsp; I whimpered, tightened, and forced my anus to relax.&nbsp;&nbsp; And then, with a sudden push, he forced it into me, I shrieked with sharp pain, and Ted clamped his hand over my mouth, muffling me.&nbsp; It hurt.&nbsp; Tears rolled down my cheeks.&nbsp; I squirmed helpless between the two of them, my body involuntarily tightening, making it hurt more.



"That's not so bad," he soothed me.&nbsp;&nbsp; 



"I'm in," he told Ted,&nbsp;&nbsp; "I'm going to give her the whole thing."&nbsp;&nbsp; 



I whimpered and tried to protest, almost breaking character.&nbsp;&nbsp; I didn't want the whole thing, I wanted it out.&nbsp;&nbsp; Unfortunately, I was held down between the two of them, my voice muffled.&nbsp; It didn't matter in that moment if I acted sober and undrugged, there was nothing I could do, and their attention was so focused on my anal violation they didn't notice.



Instead, as I struggled helplessly, Colin began feeding his big cock slowly into me.&nbsp; There was nothing I could do.&nbsp; I tightened involuntarily, whimpering with pain, and he'd stop.&nbsp; But even as it died down, he'd start pushing deeper again.&nbsp; Oh god it was so big!



Finally, I felt his hips pressing into my ass, his balls against my cunt lips.&nbsp; He was all the way up inside me.&nbsp;&nbsp; I was panting hard.&nbsp; But strangely, I was weirdly elated.&nbsp; Maybe too much oxygen from hyperventilating.&nbsp; I felt tired, and a little dizzy, and lightheaded, but it wasn't hurting too much.&nbsp; Not as much as at the start.&nbsp;&nbsp; I wasn't going to enjoy it, but okay, I thought I could endure it.&nbsp;&nbsp; I promised myself, after I got through this, it was over.&nbsp;&nbsp; The first time had been a fluke, I wasn't going to go through this again, no way.&nbsp; No more playing roofed out slut.



He began to pull back.



"Slowwww...."&nbsp; I mumbled around Ted's hand.&nbsp; I don't know if he understood me, but he got the message.&nbsp; He made his stroke really slow as he pulled almost out, then slid back in me.&nbsp; I gasped.



Ted removed his hand, but still kept hold of me.&nbsp; I moaned.&nbsp; Carefully, Colin began working his cock in and out.&nbsp; With every stroke, it seemed my anus weakened, loosened.&nbsp; It hurt less, and then not at all, and then there was just the sensation of this huge thing up inside me in an unfamiliar place.



Slowly, as Colin fucked my ass, he built up speed, occasionally making me whimper.&nbsp;&nbsp; Despite myself, I actually began to feel pleasure, arousal.&nbsp; His big thrusting member pushed up in places I never knew and I was amazed to feel my body responding.&nbsp;&nbsp; Behind the mask of being a drugged out slut, I was free to simply react, gasping and moaning with each thrust.



As the thrusts became more forceful, my body swung and heaved.&nbsp; I grunted and groaned, arching my back.&nbsp; He slapped my ass a few times.&nbsp;&nbsp; His tempo grew.&nbsp; He was pounding me.



Abruptly out of nowhere, this wave of paralysing pleasure swept through me.&nbsp; My body went rigid, I tightened, but it only made him violate me more fiercely.&nbsp; Lightning crawled up my spine.&nbsp; Ted slammed his hand on my mouth to suppress my loud moan. 



And then it was over.&nbsp; I went totally limp, covered with sweat, jerking with the aftereffects as Colin thrust deep into my bowels until he came.



"Me next!"&nbsp; Ted announced.



I shuddered.&nbsp; Oh no, not again.



The changed position.



But Colin must have ruined me.&nbsp;&nbsp; Ted's lubricated cock slid up my ass without resistance.&nbsp;&nbsp; He began to fuck me easily, and I felt the strange sensations of arousal returning.



Colin placed himself in front of me.&nbsp; His cock inches from my face, smelling of my violated rectum.&nbsp; I was not going to suck that.&nbsp; I was absolutely not going to suck that.&nbsp; I knew where it had been.



"Dude," Ted said, "she's not going to suck that.&nbsp; You just had it up her ass."



"So what," Colin asked.&nbsp;&nbsp; "No memory formation, remember.&nbsp;&nbsp; She's not going to know where it's been."



Fuck, I thought.&nbsp;&nbsp; I had no choice but to play along.&nbsp; He brushed his cock against my closed lips, but that didn't bother him.&nbsp; He just pried my jaw open with his fingers, I couldn't resist too much, and then he slid his cock into my mouth.



It wasn't so bad.&nbsp; I guess some things are worse to think about.&nbsp; The taste was hardly there, his shaft slid smoothly, and Ted pounded my ass with these rich body shaking strokes.&nbsp;&nbsp; As awful as parts of it had been, I found myself taking this deep pleasure, almost satisfaction from my position.&nbsp; Fucked up the ass by one man, sucking anothers cock.&nbsp; Ruined, violated, debased, deflowered.&nbsp;&nbsp; How dirty is it taking it up the ass.&nbsp; It was filthy.&nbsp; Slutty.&nbsp;&nbsp; And then taking a cock in my mouth after its fucked me up the ass... oh that was wonderfully depraved.&nbsp;&nbsp; Almost of its own volition, my hand found its way to my clit, and as Ted thrust deep into my bowels, I fingered to orgasm.



After they finally finished with me.&nbsp; After I'd sucked shit covered cocks and straddled them and licked their feet, after I'd spread my cheeks so they could take my ass again, and knelt in front of them with my legs spread, humiliated, violated, degraded in my own home...&nbsp; After all that, they cleaned me up.&nbsp; They were surprisingly gentle, using damp clothes to sponge the sweat off my body.&nbsp; Urging me to rinse my mouth with water.&nbsp;&nbsp; They were solicitous of my poor anus, now worried that I might be sore the next day, their previous brutality forgotten.&nbsp;&nbsp; This time there was no effort at pictures.&nbsp; They slid fresh panties on to me, and tucked me into warm sheets.



I listened, lucid but half asleep with exhaustion, as they carefully cleaned away their traces in the living room, before quietly leaving.



I totaled things up.&nbsp;&nbsp; It wasn't as good as the first time, that had been almost a perfect experience.&nbsp; But they wouldn't ever talk or tell about this.&nbsp; No anal stories about Barb. Good Point.&nbsp; Oh, but fuck, it had been scary and hurt and I'd been fucked up the ass and I hadn't wanted that.&nbsp; Bad point.&nbsp; But it hadn't turned out to be so bad, I was amazed at how much I'd ended up liking it.&nbsp; Good point?&nbsp;&nbsp; Would it hurt the next time, or would it be easier.&nbsp;&nbsp; Maybe it wouldn't even hurt at all, now that I'd had it.... Fuck that, there wouldn't be a next time.&nbsp; But then... why not try anal again... too much, decide some other time.&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh, but it had been such a nasty scene, degrading, humiliating, it had reached into deeply submissive, masochistic parts of myself and brought them to life in startling ways... was that a good point or bad point.&nbsp;&nbsp; Too tired to decide.&nbsp;&nbsp; 



I'd accidentally received quite an education, almost an instruction manual, in how to act like I was on Roofies.&nbsp;&nbsp; That was kind of cool.&nbsp; The actress in me made notes, perfected her performance.&nbsp;&nbsp; There were some mistakes I'd made.&nbsp; But next time...



Next time?&nbsp;&nbsp; Forget it.&nbsp; First time lucky.&nbsp; This time... not so lucky.&nbsp;&nbsp; Next time... I didn't want to think about that.&nbsp;&nbsp; There wasn't going to be a next time.&nbsp; I'd already pushed my luck too far.&nbsp;&nbsp; Never again, I promised myself.&nbsp;&nbsp; Absolutely never again.



If only...





















ROFFELESS, Chapter Three of Six.



I whined in pain and pleasure, writhing and bending forward as Colin shoved his hard cock relentlessly up my ass.&nbsp;&nbsp; His weight was on my back, pushing me down, as he held my forearms in place.&nbsp; Colin's motion forced my cunt even further down on Ted's thick cock, my cunt lips spreading hard against the the stiff wiring hair around his cock.&nbsp;&nbsp; His hands dug so deep into my sensitive breasts, they felt mashed like dough, the flesh bulging around his fingers. 



"Squeal bitch," Colin whispered in my ear.&nbsp; "Squeal like a pig, Barb, show us you like it.&nbsp;&nbsp; Squeal, squeal."



My eyes bulged as he sank to the root inside me, sandwiching me between these two hard male bodies.&nbsp;&nbsp; My weight, his weight on my back, supported only by Ted's hands pushing on my breasts, I could barely breath.&nbsp; I was drenched with sweat, panting uncontrollably, dripping, drooling, oozing. 



I gave my best pig squeal, as the two of them pumped me back and forth, alternating strokes in a way that pulled me apart.&nbsp; My squealing built and built, alternating with piglike snorting and whimpering, until my orgasm overtook, and I squalled out passion, going pale and limp, utterly fucked out.



They slowed, letting me catch my breath.&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, slowly, they started to pump together, pushing me to my next orgasm, as I squirmed helplessly with two cocks deep inside me, wrists tightly held in hard masculine hands, their weight, their bodies, overwhelming me.



After, they sponged the sweat away, flushed my cunt and ass, wiped me, cleaned me, and tucked me away in bed, quietly tidying up and letting themselves out.



I smiled and let myself drift off to sleep, sore but blissful, from my first ever double penetration....



Okay, so I said 'never again.'&nbsp;&nbsp; And Colin and Ted, like the cowards they were, hid out for a few days.&nbsp; I didn't see them or hear of them for almost a week.&nbsp; They really were so unthreatening.



Anyway, the next day, in the light of day, it didn't seem so bad.&nbsp;&nbsp; I mean, getting my anal cherry raped away had hurt, but being busted wasn't so bad, it hadn't lasted and it had really started to feel good.&nbsp; Intriguingly good.&nbsp; Thinking of the sensations, I sort of wanted to feel it again.&nbsp; 



Yes... it had hurt, but not nearly as bad as I'd always thought it would.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And I was perversely proud that I'd taken two cocks up my ass, one after the other.&nbsp; How utterly slutty.&nbsp; How wonderfully filthy.&nbsp; I was such a total whore, I was discovering.



And best of all, no one knew.&nbsp; I wasn't telling.&nbsp; They couldn't tell.&nbsp;&nbsp; They couldn't even throw it in my face, they didn't know I knew.&nbsp;&nbsp; I was still so many jumps ahead of them it wasn't even funny, so profoundly superior to them that it was laughable.



Oh yeah, they'd fucked me up the ass good, and I'd been scared and nervous at points.&nbsp; But hey, I was scared and nervous jumping off the high board at the swimming pool...&nbsp; Until I did it.&nbsp;&nbsp; Afterwards, I'd felt elated, triumphant...&nbsp; And over time, that was the way I felt.



Yes, it was nasty.&nbsp; Totally nasty.&nbsp; Filthy, dirty, despicable, whorish, all of that.&nbsp; It was what every woman wanted to do deep down, dreamed of doing but could never dare try.



And I was doing it.



I'd found a loophole.



There were other things.&nbsp; I liked the confidence, the assurance, the control...&nbsp; The dominance of Colin when he thought I was out.&nbsp;&nbsp; Normally, he was such a geek.&nbsp; But when he thought I'd slipped under his roofy spell, he almost became something else.&nbsp;&nbsp; It was funny to use a word like dominant about a guy like Colin...&nbsp; But it fit.



I guess it uncovered a hidden streak of submission in me.&nbsp; It was easy to be submissive playing the part.&nbsp;&nbsp; I mean, basically responsive, no real sense of borders, no apparent thoughts of my own, just working on whatever is put in my head, and no apparent short term memory.&nbsp; Basically, I was acting the part of play-dough, so there was a certain pliability.



I found I liked that.&nbsp; I liked being handled, moved, used, shaped.&nbsp; Responsible for nothing.&nbsp; Making no choices.&nbsp; Just being there, letting go.&nbsp;&nbsp; This sort of game cultivated a passive streak, opened it into full bloom.



And perhaps it encourged their domination, fanned cruelty.&nbsp;&nbsp; Ever wanted to whisper in a girls ear that she was nothing but a cunt, that you were going to fuck her until she mooed like a cow?&nbsp;&nbsp; They whispered it into my ear, and even nastier things.&nbsp;&nbsp; Maybe knowing they could get away with anything made them crueller.



But it all happened in a bubble of forgetfulness, they thought I never remembered and could never tell their secret.&nbsp; But I had the best secret.&nbsp; 



I knew everything.



Controlled everything.



So, after a few days, I called them up.&nbsp; Lured them back.&nbsp; I watched with barely concealed amusement as they screwed their nerve up again.&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh, they took their time.&nbsp;&nbsp; They could hardly keep from springing boners at around me.&nbsp;&nbsp; They were constantly having to hide them.&nbsp; I played dumb, pretending not to notice.&nbsp;&nbsp; And of course, half the time they were jumping at their shadows.&nbsp; So eager, so nervous.



By the time they worked up the nerve to try again, even more clumsy and obvious in their effort stealth, I was more than ready.&nbsp; Impatient. 



But after that?&nbsp;&nbsp; Ah, they seemed to gain some confidence.



The next time, they held me down for a double penetration, and I spread my legs and loved it.&nbsp; Actually, they spread my legs for me.&nbsp; All I had to do was squeal like a pig...&nbsp; And come.



What could be better?



Oh, I know.&nbsp;&nbsp; The risks.&nbsp;&nbsp; After my first anal violation, once I'd gotten over it and gotten okay with it, I went to the doctor and complained about my period - zap, I was on birth control pills.&nbsp;&nbsp; One problem solved.



There was the risk of disease.&nbsp;&nbsp; For that, I had to trust the boys, and their absolute care to remove all traces.&nbsp;&nbsp; They were very very careful about cleaning me.



And there was just the danger?&nbsp; But you know what?&nbsp; I kind of liked that part.



But really, there wasn't much actual danger.&nbsp; They were cowards, pathetic losers.&nbsp; They weren't going to take real risks.&nbsp;&nbsp; After all, if I woke up one morning with so much as a bruise...&nbsp; They might end up in jail.&nbsp;&nbsp; No matter how nasty they might be, might want to be, they weren't going to harm a hair on my pussy.



At least, while I had hair on my pussy.&nbsp; I shaved it smooth.&nbsp;&nbsp; It was the least I could do, a little secret I could share with them and laugh about to myself.



Saturday night they came over.



"Hey Barb," Colin said, plopping down on the couch, with a sixpack of beer.&nbsp;&nbsp; They'd gotten a lot more casual since they started regularly fucking the shit out of me.&nbsp;&nbsp; I guess they couldn't help a little bit leaking through.&nbsp; "What ya doing."



Ted sat more nervously on one of the chairs.&nbsp; He was carrying a travel bag.&nbsp;&nbsp; What was in it, I wondered?



I noticed that the corner bottle on the sixpack, that the metal cap was bent slightly.&nbsp;&nbsp; My fave brand.&nbsp; Uh huh.



"I was thinking of going out," I said.



I'd actually been planning on going dancing with some real girlfriends.&nbsp;&nbsp; But this looked kind of interesting.&nbsp;&nbsp; I wasn't convinced.&nbsp; But interesting.



"Want a beer?"



"I dunno."



"Hell Barb, live a little," Colin said.



"I'll have one," Ted said quickly.



Colin popped caps for him and Ted, handed one over, took a long draught.&nbsp;&nbsp; The little bent cap bottle was waiting for me.



"Aw, better save one for me."



Here.&nbsp; Bent cap off.&nbsp; One roofy beer coming up.



"Thanks," I said.&nbsp;&nbsp; I tipped it up to my lips and then stopped.&nbsp;&nbsp; They couldn't help but staring, like dogs begging at the dinner table, all puppy eyes and longing desire.&nbsp;&nbsp; I suppressed an urge to laugh out loud. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;



"You know what we need?&nbsp;&nbsp; Chips!"&nbsp;&nbsp; 



I scooted off to the kitchen, noisily clattering pans as I emptied a box of potato chips into a bowl, and let the beer pour quietly down the sink.&nbsp; Then I grabbed a fresh beer from the top of the fridge, uncapped, and came back out.



Then we just sat around for a while, as they sipped their beer, and I'd keep putting mine up to my lips... and get distracted at the last minute.&nbsp;&nbsp; I just loved the way their eyes tracked the bottle.



Finally, Ted broke.



"For fuck's sake, Barb!" he snapped.&nbsp;&nbsp; "Drink it or put it in the fridge, it's going to go flat!"



"Wow," I laughed, "who tied your panties in a knot this morning?"&nbsp;&nbsp; And took a deep healthy draught, holding it right up.&nbsp;&nbsp; They almost peed themselves with relief.&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh, they were so transparent.&nbsp;&nbsp; Even with roofies, I had no idea how they ever managed to get laid.



Game begun, I thought.



By this time, I had a good idea of how quickly or slowly I should be fading out.&nbsp;&nbsp; They could barely conceal their eagerness.&nbsp;&nbsp; They began moving on me quickly.&nbsp; 



"Hey," I slurred deliberately, as Colin pawed my arm.&nbsp; "We're jess frenz."



"Sorry!"



A second later, I slipped off the couch, landing on my bum on the floor, legs spread, bare thighs hiking up my dress, as I giggled uncontrollably.



Ted came up, and slid his hand down the top of my dress, cupping my breast.



"Hey!" I said.



"Shhh," he replied.&nbsp; "It's okay, Barb.&nbsp; It's okay, feels good, doesn't it.&nbsp;&nbsp; It feels good, Barb."



"Kinda good," I slurred grudgingly.



"You should just relax Barb," Colin said, running his hands up my legs, crouching over me.&nbsp; "Relax Barb," he said over and over, as he stroked my thighs, spreading my legs even further apart, gently raising my knees to bring him access to my pussy.&nbsp;&nbsp; I was already wet from the anticipation of his fingers tugging at my panties, parting my lips.&nbsp; Readying me for fucking.



They got me naked of course, crawling around on the floor giggling.&nbsp; 



"Hey Barb," Colin ordered, "lick my shoes."



Gross, I thought.&nbsp; I mean, they were sports trainers.&nbsp;&nbsp; It's one thing, you know, to be like all fetishy over polished boots and shiny patent leather and stuff.&nbsp; But Reeboks cross trainers with glo in the dark laces?&nbsp;&nbsp; I dipped my head, almost touching my lips, and then deliberately fell on my side, giggling and spreading my legs, writhing slowly and grinning as I fingered my pussy.... apparently completely out of it.



There are advantages to pretending to be totally brainless and zero attention span.&nbsp; If I really didn't feel like doing something, like totally against it, I could be very very frustrating to handle.



A bit too frustrating for them, I found.&nbsp; They were already thinking of ways to deal with it.&nbsp; Ways that involved tying me down.&nbsp;&nbsp; 



But I didn't realize that then.&nbsp; Too bad for me.



Colin grunted in frustration as I laid on my back.&nbsp; Oh I'd spoiled some masculine fantasy?&nbsp; Poor boy.&nbsp; He tried again.&nbsp;&nbsp; It only got me rolling around on the floor.



Meanwhile, Ted opened the bag, and all sorts of cheap dime store lingerie poured out.



"Ooh, pretty," I crawled clumsily over to inspect it.



"For you Barb," Colin coaxed.&nbsp; "To be pretty."



Not dime store, I thought.&nbsp;&nbsp; There were bustiers, merry widows, corsets, garter belts, all kinds of stockings, teddies.&nbsp;&nbsp; Most of it was worn or stained.&nbsp; They'd been searching thrift stores, I decided.&nbsp; I hoped it was clean.&nbsp; Some of it looked nasty.



"Play dress up, Barb."



Okay, I thought.&nbsp; This might be fun.



Colin bent down as I pawed through it.&nbsp; He slid a leather collar around my neck.&nbsp; For a second, my breathing was obstructed as he tightened it.&nbsp; I felt it shift as a leash was clipped on.&nbsp; I went totally dripping wet.



"Good girl," Colin said.&nbsp; "We're going to have a lot of fun."



I shivered, with a delicious mix of fear and anticipation, my cunt tightening involuntarily, butterflies fluttering.



Eventually, they got me into a bustier, garter belt and stockings.&nbsp; I looked drippingly whorish, crawling around on a leash in lingerie.&nbsp;&nbsp; Colin tugged on the leash, drawing my attention.&nbsp; He unzipped his fly, letting his hard cock fall out.&nbsp;&nbsp; I crawled forward to suck it, taking the head between my lips, licking precome.



Behind me, I heard buzzing, as Ted slid a vibrator along my anus, up between my lips, and against my clit.&nbsp; I moaned, arching my back for more, thrusting my ass out.&nbsp; But the vibrator slipped away, returning to tease me.



This time was different.&nbsp; Before, they'd simply fucked me.&nbsp; Hard, brutal, contemptuous fucking.&nbsp; Spreading my legs and ramming their rigid cocks in until I was screaming out loud.&nbsp; They'd been impatient, cruel, demanding, their existences crammed into their cocks, filled and rigid, intent on exploding in me.



But this time... they teased.&nbsp; The vibrator came again and again, but I didn't, not quite.&nbsp; I whimpered, whined, even begged.&nbsp; I reached down to bring myself off, but they took my hands away, binding my wrists.&nbsp;&nbsp; My hips humped the air slowly, my legs spread wantonly, my cunt lips open and dripping.



"She's ready," Colin said.



"Fuck," Ted said, "can we do her, just now."



"Let's not get distracted."



Distracted?&nbsp; What's up, I wondered.&nbsp; I didn't dare ask.&nbsp; I simply moaned and waited to see what they were up to.&nbsp; I made it more exciting, the combination of uncertainty, nervousness, curiousity, fear... and desire.&nbsp; What were they going to do to me?



Whatever it was, I knew they couldn't leave marks, I was safe.&nbsp; So that just made it...&nbsp;&nbsp; Stimulating.



And that's what they did.&nbsp; Teasing me again and again, bringing me to the edge of orgasm, and then drawing me away.&nbsp; They reduced me steadily to a squirming mess, my cunt gaping and dripping, my thighs opening and closing, my cheast heaving, my body soaked with sweat as I panted and gasped for their cocks, all the while wrapped in cheap sleazy lingerie.



"I think she's ready," Ted said.&nbsp;&nbsp; They were both rock hard, I could tell.&nbsp; Their faces were red and urgent.&nbsp; But they hadn't even taken it out of their pants.&nbsp; What were they doing?&nbsp; Oh, I needed to be fucked so bad, I could feel this deep aching up inside me that needed to be filled.



"Yeah," Colin said.&nbsp; "Let's get her into the trenchcoat."



They were taking me out?&nbsp; This was different.&nbsp; All the other times, except for the frat house, it had been in my apartment or theirs.&nbsp; I was fucked where I was drugged.



The trenchcoat wasn't too bad.&nbsp; They succeeded in getting my arms in, and the thing wrapped around me.&nbsp;&nbsp; But then, giggling, I made it hell for them to get shoes on me.



Eventually, they handled me down the back way, into Ted's car.&nbsp; Colin got into the driver's seat, while Ted poured me in the back.



"Where we going?" I asked incoherently.



"Party, Barb.&nbsp; We're going to a party."



"Like parties," I mumbled.&nbsp;&nbsp; "Lezz fuck firssst."&nbsp; I spread my legs as he buckled me in, and drew his hand to my wet cunt, masturbating against his knuckles.



"Oh christ," Ted muttered, " I got to fuck this bitch."



"Just keep her primed," Colin ordered.&nbsp;&nbsp; "Stick with the plan."



"You are going to be so fucked, Barb," Ted said.



"She is fucked," Colin replied.&nbsp; "She is sooooo fucked and she's got no idea."



For a second, my blood went cold.&nbsp; It was almost as if he knew.&nbsp; But then I relaxed.&nbsp; There was no way he could know.&nbsp; It was still my game.



Ted slid the vibrator between my legs, making it very hard to focus on anything but pleasure.&nbsp; I moaned and leaned back, lifting one knee for him to get it in me.&nbsp; Colin started the car, its lurching movement added to the sense of arousal, of my journey into this scary, sexy unknown.&nbsp; 



The car drove, I paid no attention to the twists and turns.&nbsp; My eyes were half closed.&nbsp; I enjoyed Ted's hands on my breasts, the vibrator buzzing up against me.&nbsp; 



"I can't take it any more, Colin," Ted complained.&nbsp; "Can't the bitch suck my cock."



"Do it quick."



Ted pulled his pants down.&nbsp; With a quick motion, he grabbed my hair and dragged my head down to his waste.&nbsp; There was no finesse, his grip on my hair hurt and made my eyes water.&nbsp; As I whimpered, he forcefully shoved my face deep down on his cock, thrusting into my mouth like it was a cunt.&nbsp; The roughness, the urgent cruelty excited me.&nbsp; The seat belt cut into my waist, my breasts fell out of my coat, and the vibrator he had shoved up inside me made me almost crazy with lust as it shifted in me.&nbsp; Oh god I was so close to coming...



"We're here," Colin said.&nbsp;&nbsp; Ted shoved my face even harder, mashing my nose against his crotch, humped up so hard I couldn't breath, my face was so tight against his flesh I couldn't breath.&nbsp; I felt him ejaculate load after load down my throat and swallowed as fast as I could, but still it trickled down.



Colin finished parking, and checked me out in the mirror, gazing at my dazed red face, my now tangled hair.&nbsp; Lips swollen from hard face fucking, come dribbling down my chin.



"Perfect," he said.



I dared to look around with vague imprecision.&nbsp;&nbsp; I'd thought we might be going to the frat house for another gang bang.&nbsp; Instead it was a cheap motel in the middle of nowhere.&nbsp; Together they pulled me out of the car, and helped me walk down to a room.&nbsp; The curtain flickered.&nbsp; There was someone inside it.&nbsp;&nbsp; My stomach fluttered.&nbsp; Whatever they had planned, it was right on top.



I had a sudden impulse to run.&nbsp; It 'snap out of it' start yelling and screaming.&nbsp; I could still bail out.&nbsp; This was my last chance.



I knew that once I went through that door, I had lost all control.&nbsp; Whoever was in there was going to do whatever they wanted.&nbsp; Once it began...&nbsp; I was fucked... in every possible way.



This was something I'd come to understand.&nbsp; Like I said, once I passed a certain point...&nbsp; Well, they thought they were raping me anyway.... they'd already crossed that line, they wouldn't stop raping me just because I 'woke.'&nbsp; It would just be a different kind of rape... nastier, more violent, more genuinely dangerous.&nbsp; What would they do if they found this girl they were planning to rape, were raping, was actually going to remember everything.&nbsp; They might do... something...



Once over the line, past the point of no return, there was no choice but to keep pretending, keep acting, no matter what.&nbsp; 



And there was something else...&nbsp; If I let them know I wasn't really under, and had gone this far.&nbsp; They'd know, or suspect that all the other times, I hadn't really been under.&nbsp; They'd know what a slut I was, every filthy secret would be exposed.&nbsp;&nbsp; As long as they thought I didn't remember, hadn't really agreed or consented... it was as if it had never happened.&nbsp; I wasn't responsible.&nbsp; I was clean, pure, innocent.&nbsp; I was a good girl, not a degenerate slut.&nbsp; They were rapists, they had to be careful, they had to be very, very careful.&nbsp; It all worked out perfectly for me, apart from the occasional speed bump.



But once that ended...&nbsp;&nbsp; Once my secret was out, once they knew, and they knew that I knew...



The motel room door opened.&nbsp;&nbsp; A tall middle aged black man was there, his body thick with that way men get when they get older.&nbsp; His skin was dark, he was starting to bald.&nbsp;&nbsp; He looked me up and down like a piece of meat.



"This it?" he asked.&nbsp; 



"It," not "her," I shivered.&nbsp; I was fuck meat.&nbsp; I was holes to fuck.



Over his shoulder, I could see dark shaped in the room.&nbsp; More men.&nbsp; A lot of men.&nbsp; Black men.&nbsp; I'd never fucked a black guy before, I'd never had black cock.&nbsp;&nbsp; The black guys at university had always been too immature and eager.&nbsp;&nbsp; But of course, I'd heard stories, we all did, of nigger cock.&nbsp; Even if it was all bull, the stories went around.



"Here she is," Colin said.&nbsp; "She's dripping wet.&nbsp; She's totally ready."



"Is she set up?"



"She's not going to remember a fucking thing.&nbsp; Five minutes after you come in her, she won't remember your face."



"Bet she'll remember my dick, though."



Casually, he reached out his hand, as if to shake.&nbsp; I lifted my hand in response.&nbsp; But he ignored it and just reached in and pulled my breast out of my trenchcoat, squeezing and weighing it



"Nice titty," he grunted.&nbsp;&nbsp; "Good and firm.&nbsp; Prime meat.&nbsp; Might as well bring her in."



They walked me into the room, Colin holding my elbow to steady me.&nbsp;&nbsp; It was good, because even without the drugs, I felt helpless and wobbly, my legs were weak and trembling.&nbsp; I felt light, weightless, butterflies seemed everywhere in my guts.



The room was full of men, black men.&nbsp;&nbsp; Older men, mature and middle aged.&nbsp; Their bodies heavy with a sort of mature strength.&nbsp;&nbsp; It reeked of testosterone and masculinity.&nbsp; 



"Let's see the rest of her."



Colin pulled my trenchcoat off, leaving me exposed in high heels, stockings and bustier, my breasts and cunt bared.&nbsp;&nbsp; They're going to fuck me, I thought.&nbsp; All these niggers are going to fuck me like a slut.&nbsp; They're going to come in me, and come on me, and use their cocks one after another and fill me up and make me beg and come and spread my legs for them.



A black hand reached between my thighs.&nbsp; A thick rude finger slid up me, making me gasp.&nbsp; I closed my eyes, helpless with lust and fear and desire.



"She's fucking dripping all night."



"She's tight," Colin said.



"Won't be tight when we're finished with her."&nbsp;&nbsp; The words shot through me like sexual lightning, electrifying me.&nbsp; I almost came right there.&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe won't be tight ever.&nbsp; We got a deal."



I opened my eyes a little, lids half slitted, and watched as the black man peeled off bill after bill, handing it to Colin.&nbsp; He'd sold me!&nbsp;&nbsp; They were prostituting me, reducing me to a whore, selling my cunt.



It made me even wetter.&nbsp; It was so degrading...&nbsp;&nbsp; So humiliating.



The black man stroked my ass.



"Oh, I'm going to love tapping&nbsp; that."



Colin shrugged.



"The bitch takes it up the ass."



"Oh yeah," the other asked.&nbsp; "Broken in."



"Totally.&nbsp; The cunt loves it."



He slapped my butt.



"Good to know."



I was lead on the leash to the filthy mattress in the center of the room.&nbsp; I knelt on it, going to all fours, bending my head.&nbsp;&nbsp; There were a lot more men this time.&nbsp;&nbsp; Black men, with their dark skins and curly hair, their big lips and strong hands and bigger cocks, waiting to ruin my tight white pussy.&nbsp;&nbsp; I felt my thighs trembling with need.&nbsp; Oh god, I was such a slut, wanting this.



"You want to stick around and watch," a deep black male voice said.



"Sure," Colin said.&nbsp; You could tell he was so excited, so rigid he could barely speak, his voice was tense and strained.&nbsp;&nbsp; It wasn't just about selling me for the money.&nbsp; He wanted to see me fucked by nigger cocks, wanted me debased and degraded.&nbsp; And he wanted to be the one that made it happen, reduced me to a fucked out skank, holes dripping semen from a dozen hard cocks, a mindless wet slut.



"Enjoy."



No.&nbsp; Not a slut.&nbsp; I was a whore.&nbsp; Colin had made me a whore.&nbsp;&nbsp; This new aspect to degradation only made me wetter, more wanton.



Someone knelt behind me.&nbsp; I didn't even look.&nbsp; Someone else's cock was floating in front of me.&nbsp; As I opened my mouth to take it in my throat, firm hands spread my ass cheeks and thrust brutally up my ass.



It was only the beginning....



 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;



























ROOFELESS 4



I was �under' again, stripped naked in my own bedroom.&nbsp;&nbsp; They'd pushed my bed to the center of the room.&nbsp;&nbsp; Colin was tying my ankles so that I was spread wide.&nbsp;&nbsp; Ted was wrapping soft rope around my wrists, binding them together and pulling them up over my head.



"Make sure you get a pillow under her head," he said.&nbsp; " I want her to watch this."



I was already dripping wet.



They were tying me more and more often.&nbsp;&nbsp; You would think that didn't seem necessary.&nbsp; But the thing was, that even �out' on roofies, I was still moving around, sort of coordinated.&nbsp;&nbsp; If a drugged out slut didn't like something, she might struggle or squirm, could be sort of hard to manage..&nbsp; 



I'd taken advantage of that at times to have some fun, to just sort of really play with them and frustrate the hell out of them as I kept falling or drifting out of whatever position they'd put me in.&nbsp; And if they wanted to do something I didn't particularly want to do... well, I didn't mind making them work for it.



I suppose the joke was on me, because they'd started tying me to keep me in place when they used me.&nbsp;&nbsp; But it was exciting in another way.&nbsp;&nbsp; And harmless, I knew that whatever happened, nothing bad could happen.&nbsp;&nbsp; At most, they'd fuck me in a position I didn't particularly want, or tease me, or do my ass, or spank me a little.



The truth was.... I kind of liked it.&nbsp;&nbsp; What I was doing was all about helplessness.&nbsp;&nbsp; About playing and pretending to be helpless as these two men used and violated my body in the most sexually intense ways.&nbsp; And tying me up made me even more helpless, which made me wetter.



I was dripping.



Colin finished tying my ankles.



My cunt lips were parted.&nbsp; I could feel my wetness trickling down.



"You got her?"&nbsp; He asked.



"Yep," Ted replied.



I glanced up at him, keeping my gaze vague.



"Showtime," Colin said.&nbsp;&nbsp; He climbed up, straddling my waist.&nbsp;&nbsp; His hard cock brushed against my nipples, dampening them with precome.&nbsp; I licked my lips.&nbsp; Was he going to titfuck me?&nbsp;&nbsp; Or slide his cock forward, thrusting beneath my lips and make me gag on his big hard meat.



Was he going to piss on my face and breasts?&nbsp; They had talked about that other times.&nbsp; Shower my face with his hot golden stream of male urine, hose it into my features, let it drip down my chin, splashing over my breasts and belly.&nbsp;&nbsp; My heart raced with excitement at the thought, at the vision of cruel humiliation and degradation.&nbsp; 



No, he wouldn't do that here.&nbsp; Maybe at his place.&nbsp; Or somewhere else.&nbsp; But if he pissed on me in my own bed, he'd have to change the sheets, clean up, it would get into the mattress, might smell, that would be hard to hide.



His cock was the best part of him.&nbsp; This big hard, mean porn star cock on his scrawny body.&nbsp; I loved the nasty way he used it on me, the total lack of hesitation, the utter ruthlessness of it.



He slapped my face, hard.&nbsp; Disrupting my wandering lust crazed thoughts.&nbsp; I focused, startled, just like I was supposed to.



"Bitch," he said, "pay attention."



I paid attention.



He held up his fist.



"Do you know what this is?"



I giggled and got a little vague again.



"Your hand."



He slapped my face a second time.&nbsp; My cheek stung.



"A fist."



"A fist."



"Do you know what fisting is?"



My heart skipped a beat, my guts tightened into roiling knots, even my cunt seemed to squeeze shut.



"Uhhh."



Slap.&nbsp;&nbsp; 



They were doing that more and more as they grew more confident and controlling.&nbsp; Not hard, never enough to bruise.&nbsp; But enough to sting.&nbsp; To focus the attention of the drugged out slut, confident that she wouldn't even remember it five minutes later.&nbsp; My face, my ass, my tits, they even slapped my pussy.&nbsp; It increased their sense of domination and power over me, this ability to slap me when they felt like it.



They thought I didn't remember, that the knowledge of it faded after a few minutes.&nbsp; So that was how I had to pretend.&nbsp; But of course, I did remember.&nbsp; And it made me more submissive, more under control, more docile to their will.&nbsp; It was mostly play, of course, I wasn't really scared or really hurt...&nbsp; It would sting a little, mostly the suddenness was shocking, and they could never dare go any harder for fear of leaving a mark.&nbsp;&nbsp; But still, it had an accumulating effect on me.&nbsp; I found myself becoming ever more sexually submissive to their ever increasing sexual domination.



Sometimes I wondered if it seeped out into normal life.&nbsp; Our �normal' friendship, beauty and the geeks, no longer seemed so one sided.&nbsp; Sometimes it almost seemed as if they were in control.&nbsp; But then I'd catch myself, assert myself, and they'd fold like the losers they were.&nbsp; But I had to watch myself sometimes... there was a tendency, very slight, for them to ... press.&nbsp; And a tendency in me to... not quite submit, but to go along.



Slap.



My cheek stung.



I stared at Colin.



"I'm going to fist you, Barb," he said.&nbsp;&nbsp; "You know what that means?&nbsp; I'm going to put two fingers in your cunt, then three, then four, then my whole hand.&nbsp; I'm going to shove my whole fist right up inside your cunt and fuck you with it.&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you want that."



My heart was pounding.&nbsp;&nbsp; I wasn't sure I could handle it, not at all.&nbsp; But I also knew that there was no choice.&nbsp;&nbsp; Would it hurt?&nbsp; How much?&nbsp; What would it feel like?&nbsp;&nbsp; I was scared.&nbsp;&nbsp; But deep down, there was also a sick, submissive excitement that I recognized, a hollow yearning in the pit of my stomach.



I had no choice but to play it through, to stay in the role and act like a drugged out slut.



"Do you want that, Barb," he repeated.



I knew the answer he wanted.



"Nu- nu� no," I whispered.&nbsp; Even drugged out, I could still focus, and this is one of those times when I would have been focused.&nbsp; I had no trouble staring at him.



"Say please, then."&nbsp; He whispered.



"Wha- wha- What?"



"You don't want to be fist fucked?"



I shook my head.



"Then you have to say, �please master Colin don't fist fuck my poor little white trash pussy.'



"Please, please," I mumbled.&nbsp; He wanted me to beg.&nbsp; He wanted to tease and torture me.&nbsp; Oh god, I was so fucking wet.&nbsp; I wished he'd just slam that big porn star cock in me and fuck me good.&nbsp; But I knew I was trapped and helpless, and whatever happened would be what he wanted.



"Please what?"



"Please...."



"Please what?"



"Please..."&nbsp; That was a long sentence he'd given me.&nbsp; He'd be expecting the details to begin fading right away, for me to get it wrong...&nbsp;&nbsp; "Please Mister Colin don't fuck, don't fuck...&nbsp;&nbsp; fist me...&nbsp; My...&nbsp; Please... fist my ... trash ... pussy.&nbsp; Don't... please."



He smiled.



"Sorry Barb, you didn't say it right.&nbsp; Guess you really don't mind."



He kissed me on the forehead, even as he reached and squeezed my nipple really fucking hard.&nbsp; It hurt!&nbsp;&nbsp; I screamed and immediately, Ted clamped a hand over my mouth, muffling, me.



"Going to fist fuck you now, Barb.&nbsp; I want you to watch."



I thrashed, by my legs were secured spread open.&nbsp; Ted held my wrists and mouth.&nbsp; All I could do was mumble and heave, totally trapped, totally opened to his latest violation.&nbsp;&nbsp; He crept down, enjoying my frenzied, half genuine, fearful squirming, until he knelt between my legs.



"Gee Barb," he taunted, fingering my cunt, "you're really wet.&nbsp; I don't think I'll have any trouble getting my hold hand in this fucked out pussy.&nbsp; I might not even need lubrication."



At the threat not to lubricate, I bucked wildly, not that it did anything but bury his fingers deep in my wet cunt, and push me to the edge of an orgasm.&nbsp; My heart was just hammering.&nbsp; I could barely breath through Ted's clamped hand.&nbsp; I was dizzy.&nbsp; Was he serious?&nbsp; Would he really do it?



Three fingers.



Oh god.



Four fingers.



Oh god yes, he was going to do it.



He twisted four fingers inside me, back and fourth, stretching me.&nbsp; I whimpered and moaned, struggling helplessly, knowing I was helpless, free to struggle, knowing the outcome.&nbsp;&nbsp; I pushed breath around Ted's constricting palm.&nbsp; Arched my back.&nbsp; Pushed my hips up into the air.



Colin pushed back slowly, bending his thumb in, pushing up to the knuckles, forcing my hips flat on the bed.



"You might need some lubrication after all, Barb," Colin mocked.



"Do it man."&nbsp; Ted urged.



Colin squirted lubrication on and around, worked it in with the fingers of his free hand, and started to twist his wrist back and forth in corkscrewing motions.&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh god, it hurt.&nbsp; I could feel myself stretching...&nbsp; Stretching.



Oh god, I though, stop.&nbsp; I was ready to beg, ready to break character.



He kept pushing, stretching me....&nbsp; I whimpered.&nbsp;&nbsp; Back arching, body tightening.



"Almost there, Barb," he said, "can you feel it?"



No, I thought.&nbsp; I can't stop him.&nbsp; All I'll do it make it worse.&nbsp; Relax, try to relax.&nbsp; Submit.



Submit.



And then the knuckles passed through, the overwhelming pressure eased, and his hand almost seemed to flow into my pussy, I could feel it filling me as he sank deep to his wrist, his fingers curling naturally into a fist.



It felt huge in me.&nbsp; I felt stretched to my utter limit.&nbsp; It left me gasping and sweating.&nbsp; I struggled to breath, on the verge of passing out.



"Let her have some air," Colin ordered.&nbsp;&nbsp; "But clamp down if she screams."



The hand off my mouth, I desperately sucked air, panting like a bitch, staring down at my enormously distended pussy, the thick slab of his wrist buried inside me.&nbsp;&nbsp; I could hardly believe what I was seeing.&nbsp; But I could feel it, feel this immensity stretching me, distending me.&nbsp; I could hardly believe my belly wasn't swollen, he felt so big inside me.&nbsp;&nbsp; I stared, hypnotized, my eyes going in and out of focus.



"How do you like it, Barb," Colin sneered.



"Oh man, that's fucking awesome," Ted laughed, "you got your whole fist in her!"&nbsp;&nbsp; Holding my wrists tight, I could feel his free hand running through my hair, twining, wrapping, strands around my fingers.&nbsp;&nbsp; I could feel his hard cock behind me, feel the urgency and force in his body.&nbsp;&nbsp; In a few minutes, he'd tighten his grip, twisting my head back, forcing my jaw open, and feeding his thick shaft roughly down my throat.



"Do you like it, Barb?"&nbsp; Colin asked again, giving his wrist a quick push that made my heart skip.



"Oh," I said.&nbsp;&nbsp; It was the safest thing I could think of.



He started to move his fist back and forth in me in little motions.



"Oh," I said again.



"Oh."



"Oh!"



"I think she likes it after all," 



"OH!"



"OH!!"



"OHHHH!!!!"



An immense tortured orgasm swept over me, and for a few minutes, I couldn't breath.&nbsp; Every muscle in my body seemed to be spasming, rigid.&nbsp; Then I went limp.



"Feel that," Colin asked.&nbsp;&nbsp; "She's totally boneless, look at how easy she's gone."



His fist was now moving in and out, pushing me with deep stroked that seemed to make me exhale and inhale, his fist controlling my breathing, my whole body.&nbsp;&nbsp; Even in the echoes of the orgasm, I could feel the sensations building up again as his fist worked against my taut, stretched g-spot.



"I'm wrecking you, Barb," Colin said.



Ted couldn't hold back any more.&nbsp; He pulled my hair savagely, arching my neck, bringing a cry of pain.&nbsp; And as my mouth opened wide, he rammed his rigid meat down my throat.&nbsp;&nbsp; He began to pump, as if fucking me.&nbsp;&nbsp; I closed my eyes and let it happen, and came again and again.



They barged over the next day.&nbsp;&nbsp; 



They'd cleaned me up and put me to bed like always.&nbsp; But I'd had a savage fisting, I'd occasionally woken up a little sore, but I was hurting.&nbsp;&nbsp; I stayed in bed the morning and even when they dropped by, inviting themselves in.&nbsp;&nbsp; I stayed in my bathrobe, making coffee for them.



"You okay, Barb," Colin asked, innocently, watching as I moved carefully.



Asshole, I thought.



"I'm kind of sore," I said.&nbsp;&nbsp; "Some sort of female thing, I think."



"Were you doing anything?" Ted asked.



Asshole, I thought again.



"You mean apart from the 5:00 AM, lesbian invitational volleyball tournament?&nbsp;&nbsp; Not that I can remember.&nbsp;&nbsp; I didn't do anything after you guys left.&nbsp; Watched TV maybe. Went to bed."



I shrugged.



I sat down with the tray of coffee and gave them their cups.



"What's it feel like?"&nbsp;&nbsp; Colin asked.



"Sore," I said, "sore and achy.&nbsp; Kind of like, I dunno...."



"I was reading this article, �Spastic Vagina syndrome,' it's about girls who don't get enough..."



"I don't get any," I complained.



"We could help," Ted smirked.



"Anyway," Colin continued, "if they don't get a...&nbsp; a... workout every now and then, sometimes the muscles will just kind of tense out on their own, like cramping up.&nbsp; It's connected to periods."



Oh, I thought.&nbsp; You son of a bitch.



"Where do you get this?" I asked.



"Readers digest."



"Readers Digest has articles about Spastic Vaginas?"



"Body parts series, you know, I am �Joe's Vagina.'"



"Joe?"



"Jane's."



Colin sipped.



"I asked for artificial sweetener." He said. 



"I'm pretty sure you didn't."



"I can taste the difference."



I stared hard.



He returned my gaze, with a bland half smile.



Eventually, I got up and made him a new cup of coffee all over again.



Assholes, I thought.



The lines were sort of starting to blur, I was finding.&nbsp;&nbsp; The sex, oh the sex was incredible.&nbsp; It was addictive, this descent into dark forbidden fantasies, this endless well of sensation.&nbsp; 





It wasn't just sex with them.&nbsp; The loved debasing me, and I found I loved it.&nbsp;&nbsp; There was a night they took me into an alley, and behind a dumpster, I was fucked by filthy winos.&nbsp; There were gangbangs at the frat house.&nbsp; Once they brought me to a peep show with glory holes, and kept the door open, making me suck cocks and masturbate with a vibrator.&nbsp; Another time, they entered me in a wet T-shirt contest, I had to pretend I couldn't really dance, but I squirmed around on the stage showing my pussy as men threw coins and squirted beer at my cunt.



Sometimes it was scary, but it was never really dangerous... they had to be careful after all, and I clung to that reassurance.&nbsp;&nbsp; But it was always unpredictable, intense.&nbsp; It was... an adventure.



In a way, it was too good.&nbsp;&nbsp; My social life suffered.&nbsp;&nbsp; Part of it was simply the temptation, every time they came by, to just let them have their way.&nbsp;&nbsp; Part of it was their increasing drain on my time.&nbsp; I saw my real friends less and less.&nbsp;&nbsp; 



In some ways, my real life friends just weren't as fun or interesting.&nbsp;&nbsp; Even when the geeks weren't fucking me, when it was normal, there was a sort of hidden excitement, a hidden tension, of what they might do, when their next plan, their next little attempt to drug me.&nbsp; It was a cat and mouse game, where I thought of myself as a secret cat, it was addictive.



And there was that I was starting to get a reputation.&nbsp;&nbsp; Roofie gangbangs were one thing, but even word of that, garbled, sort of drifted around.&nbsp; Other things, well, people didn't know I was supposed to be out of it, they just heard I was slutting out.



I'm sure it was nothing, you know.&nbsp; Just rumours and shit, and no one believed it.&nbsp; But yeah, there was stuff starting to go around.&nbsp; Which was ironic, because part of the attraction was the total secrecy... they couldn't ever tell anyone, the stories would never get out, no one would ever know.



There were other downsides.&nbsp;&nbsp; I found it was ruining me for regular sex.&nbsp; I went out with this guy, set up by one of my real friends.&nbsp;&nbsp; Normally, we'd go a few dates before getting to sex, I was still a good girl after all.&nbsp; But what with one thing and another, he was putting moves on me, and I was finding myself a lot more docile lately, docile in everything, so he wound up fucking me.&nbsp;&nbsp; And it was...&nbsp; Bland.&nbsp; Uninteresting.&nbsp;&nbsp; There was none of the dark tension, the unpredictability, the wet intensity I had become used to.&nbsp; He seemed barely aggressive, not really taking control.&nbsp;&nbsp; It left me feeling incomplete, unfinished.



And my grades were suffering.&nbsp; Again, kind of ironic, it was sort of like part of the attraction was that I could have wild sex without wasting time on all the relationship bullshit, so it wouldn't drag down my marks.&nbsp; But it sort of evolved to consume so much of my energy that my academic work was slipping.&nbsp; Not so bad I couldn't make it up.&nbsp; But, the funny thing was that although I kept meaning to concentrate on my studies, they were sort of boring, and I'd find myself drifting over to Colin or Ted, or inviting them over.&nbsp;&nbsp; It was only when they kind of got heavy into their own studies that I could seem to work on my grades, and it never seemed to last.&nbsp;&nbsp; No big deal, sooner or later, I was going to crack down.&nbsp;&nbsp; This was just a thing.&nbsp; I might be cock crazed, but I had my big picture, long term, it would get taken care of.



Everything seemed to come back to my increasingly blurry relationship with Colin and Ted.&nbsp;&nbsp; On the surface, it was all stable.&nbsp;&nbsp; They were my geeks when everything was straight, and they fucked me unmercifully, when they thought they had me out.&nbsp; Clear divisions.&nbsp;&nbsp; But, I don't know.&nbsp; It was hard to put my finger on.&nbsp;&nbsp; The day relationship seemed somehow less clear cut.&nbsp; Oh, one or the other might make a pass at me, and get shot down.&nbsp;&nbsp; I might like them fucking me, but I certainly wasn't going to date either of them.&nbsp;&nbsp; I liked flirting and sort of showing off, I wore more skirts and more tight clothes and stuff, they liked that.&nbsp; Not dressing slutty, but sometimes, just sort of pushing it.&nbsp; And I think I was more.... docile overall, so they tended to barge into my life more.&nbsp; 



Docile, what do I mean by that.&nbsp; Well, here's an example.&nbsp; I was going to go out and do a little shopping for some blue jeans.&nbsp; But they showed up and invited themselves along, and we wound up spending half our time going to places they wanted, and I ended up spending three times as much as I was planning to, and mostly on clothes they liked, tight tops and sundresses and this slutty skirt with a slit up the side that I had no idea where I could actually wear - I didn't even get jeans.&nbsp; A short little trip wound up taking the whole afternoon, because they sort of took it over on me.



No big deal, I just needed to remember when to make sure lines were drawn.&nbsp; Whenever I pushed back, they folded.&nbsp; But they sort of seemed to push more and more... and I tended to push back less.



Sometimes they weren't as careful cleaning me up as they might.



I remember the night they left this big butt plug in me.&nbsp; They were exhausted, they'd blown their loads in me three or four times each.&nbsp; But still, this was a huge butt plug.&nbsp;&nbsp; Sometimes they'd forget to clean their come off of my body, or douche me, you know, that sort of thing you might overlook once in a while.&nbsp; But this was big.&nbsp; 



I pulled it carefully out and dropped it in a corner of the living room, and went to sleep.



The next day, they came over.&nbsp;&nbsp; We were all sitting around, and Colin spotted the butt plug in the corner.&nbsp; He went so pale, I almost laughed out loud.&nbsp;&nbsp; I pretended not to notice, as he sort of got Ted to look at it, and Ted just freaked.&nbsp;&nbsp; 



After that, I had a great time, just being oblivious and not leaving, as they worked desperately to keep me from noticing the big black butt plug, smeared with my own shit, and get me out of the room so they could make it disappear.



I loved it, I thought the whole episode was so hilarious.&nbsp; It confirmed my superiority to them, and their geek inferiority.&nbsp; That I was the �oh so clever' cat, and they were just mice with delusions.



I think maybe it was a mistake.&nbsp;&nbsp; I think maybe that incident sort of fooled me into thinking I was more in control than I actually was.



Because otherwise, I don't think the thing with the dog would have happened...

























ROOFELESS 5



It all started when they took me over to this nerd friend of theirs.&nbsp; I don't know, maybe they were all Dungeons and Dragons partners or something.&nbsp;&nbsp; Or maybe he hardly knew them at all, and was just... buying me.&nbsp;&nbsp; He still lived with his parents, who were out for the weekend.



It was a pretty nice place, and we were all fooling around in the living room.



I was already 'under' by that time.&nbsp; Basically, their MO was usually to 'slip' me their roofies at my apartment.&nbsp; That way, I'd fade out in my home, and when I woke up in my own bed, then I wouldn't know any better.&nbsp;&nbsp; It was riskier to 'slip' me some somewhere else, I'd have memories of being there and would start to wonder how I got home, and why my ass felt like it had been fucked&nbsp;&nbsp; They really didn't want that.



I didn't mind.&nbsp; If they were trying to slip me something in my own apartment, it was a lot easier to spot and to dodge.&nbsp; Or if I wasn't in the mood, to just keep foiling their efforts until they gave up in frustration.&nbsp;&nbsp; I did that now and then, you know, just to keep them on their toes and to reassure myself I was still really the one in control.



Of course, it went both ways.&nbsp; Sometimes they actually managed to really slip me some, and I'd wake up the next day, knowing I'd been fucked, even feeling it in my cunt and ass, but not a single memory.&nbsp;&nbsp; Did I feel raped?&nbsp;&nbsp; Nah.&nbsp; It was sort of an occupational hazard.&nbsp; If anything, I think I'd feel mildly pissed... I mean, I'd had great, nasty sex, probably come all over the place, and I didn't remember any of it.&nbsp; It felt like the experience was stolen.&nbsp;&nbsp; But overall, I just chalked it up to occupational hazard, you know.&nbsp; A risk of the game I was playing.&nbsp;&nbsp; A reminder that I had to be a little smarter than them.



Anyway, I was naked and laying on this glass coffee table, getting felt up and kissed by Colin and his friend.&nbsp; 



Ted was taking pictures.&nbsp;&nbsp; I didn't necessarily like that.&nbsp;&nbsp; But there wasn't a lot I could do.&nbsp; So I got used to it.&nbsp;&nbsp; Pics of my body, without my face, that was okay.&nbsp;&nbsp; If my face was in, I always tried to look as out of it as I could, but you know, they could slap me or snap fingers and I'd have to look alert for a second.&nbsp; But I figured in the long run, it would be evidence against them...&nbsp; All these pics of times they'd fucked me when they thought I was out on roofies.&nbsp; Sometimes I amused myself by thinking about how those pictures might get them sent to jail.



Laying out spread open on a glass coffee table probably looked a lot sexier than it actually was.&nbsp; Have you ever been naked on glass?&nbsp; It's too hard, and your skin sort of sticks to it.&nbsp; You leave these icky 'body-smudges'&nbsp; It was too short, my head was barely on one end, and my ass hung off the other, and I was sort of worried about the glass breaking under our weight.



As I was groped, and spread, and teased, as a cock was thrust into my mouth, and teeth nibbled at each of my nipples, I felt my cunt being licked wildly and loosely, almost a slobbering on my cunt.



Washed in pleasure, stimulated from all directions, it took me a little while to realize there was something wrong, I was being touched in too many places all at once, there weren't enough body parts.&nbsp;&nbsp; Someone extra was here, someone was licking my pussy.&nbsp; Or something.



For a second, I almost broke character when I realized that the dog that had been in the house must be the one licking my pussy.&nbsp;&nbsp; The way the tongue slobbered and moved.&nbsp; Oh god, it had to be the dog.



My eyes widened, my expression shifted, but Colin was thrusting down my throat, so if he or anyone else noticed, they just put it down to, you know, gagging round the throat fucking.



Mind racing, I tried to think of something.&nbsp; I was getting my pussy licked by a dog!&nbsp; That was too much.&nbsp;&nbsp; Why didn't they stop it?&nbsp; How come they weren't noticing?



But they didn't seem to notice at all, so engrossed they were in groping me.&nbsp; I couldn't believe it.&nbsp; I had to signal, tell them.



Finally, Colin let me breathe a little.&nbsp;&nbsp; 



"Oh, oh," I moaned, "that tongue on my pussy."&nbsp;&nbsp; As a 'drugged out' slut, that was all that was safe to say, as much as I wanted to, I couldn't shout - 'get that mutt out of my cunt!'



But it was enough.



"Hey," Ted said, "the dog is licking her pussy."



He pushed it away.



Thank you, I thought.



"Hey," Colin said, "leave him.&nbsp; She likes it."



No I didn't!



"Hey Barb," Colin whispered.&nbsp; "You like getting your pussy licked."



Oh, you bastard, I thought.



"You love it, don't you, Barb," he coaxed.



I tried to evade by moaning incoherently, but this sign of apparent pleasure only egged them on.



"Say it, Barb," Colin ordered, "say, 'I love tongue on my pussy.'"



Trapped.&nbsp; Cornered, unable to escape the role, I said the only thing a drugged out slut, out on roofies, with no thoughts of her own, could say to that.&nbsp;&nbsp; "I love ohhh love tongue... oh pussy... lick."



Ted let the dog return between my legs, his tongue slobbering over my heaving, writhing, hips, going all over, slipping between my lips, lashing wetly from my asshole to my clit.&nbsp;&nbsp; They watched, fascinated.



"See," Colin said, "she loves it."



Oh, you bastard, I thought deliriously.&nbsp; I would get him back for this, someday, I promised myself.



But trapped in the restrictions of the role, I couldn't do anything but just lay there, legs spread and moan deliriously, with the animal licking between my legs, invading my most secret, most intimate places.



Colin grabbed my hair, lifting my head.&nbsp; I moaned slightly with the pain of the hair pulling, Colin intended it to focus my scattered attention.



"Look what's licking your pussy, bitch," he said.&nbsp; My head elevated, I could see the big mongrel between my legs, eagerly licking my dripping slit.



"No," I was finally allowed to say.&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ssss a doggg, sstop him..."



"Relax, Barb," he whispered, lowering my head down.&nbsp;&nbsp; "It's not so bad."



"Nooooo....."



"Yes," he replied.&nbsp;&nbsp; "In fact, it's kind of nice, isn't it."



I tried to shake my head, but his hand still gripped my hair.



"Yes, Barb, its so nice Barb.&nbsp; Just enjoy it Barb.&nbsp; There's nothing you can do Barb.&nbsp; Just let it happen Barb.&nbsp; It feels so good, Barb."



I knew what I had to say: What he was telling me to say, telling me to think, because pretending to be roofied out, I wasn't supposed to have thoughts of my own.&nbsp; I wasn't supposed to be able to distinguish my own thoughts from what he was whispering.&nbsp;&nbsp; Damn him.&nbsp; I surrendered...



"Feels good."



It did of course, it felt really good.



"That's a good girl, Barb.&nbsp; Feels good.&nbsp; Just let it happen, Barb.&nbsp; It's okay, Barb.&nbsp; Say it, say 'it's okay.'"



"It's okay."



"There we go.&nbsp;&nbsp; Barb, you like it, don't you, Barb.&nbsp; Say you like it."



"I like it."



"What do you like, Barb..."



Oh, you bastard, I thought again.



"Like pussy licking...&nbsp; Feels good."



"By a dog.&nbsp; You like getting your pussy licked by a dog, don't you, Barb.&nbsp; Say it, Barb, say 'I love doggy licking my wet cunt.'"



I squirmed desperately, maybe I could writhe off the table, accidentally close my legs or kick him away.&nbsp;&nbsp; I moaned.&nbsp;&nbsp; No good, they held my body in place.&nbsp;&nbsp; Firm strong hands were now holding my thighs open, spreading my legs to give the dog access.&nbsp;&nbsp; I was totally humiliated, debased, defiled... worst of all, my body responded on its own, my cunt just kept getting wetter and wetter, sensual pleasure filled me, an orgasm began to mount.



"Say it, Barb," Colin kept insisting.&nbsp; A relentless, insidious voice in my ear.



Oh god, I could feel it, I was going to come.



"Say it, Barb.&nbsp; Say how much you love that dog licking your wet cunt."



All of a sudden, I couldn't hold it back.&nbsp;&nbsp; I screamed it out, my back arching, wetness gushing, "Oh god oh god I love it I love my wet cunt licked by a dog oh god!!!"



Colin's friend started coming, jerking off madly, ejaculating and spraying like a firehouse all over my belly and tits and face.



In the aftermath, there was a kind of awed silence, broken only by my and Colin's friends desperate post-orgasmic panting and the dog's meticulous, loud, lapping.



"Wow," Ted breathed.



"I guess we should stop it now, uh?" Colin's geek friend said finally.



Colin had let his hand drift from my hair, down my face, cupping my jaw, a finger across my lips.&nbsp; His rampant erection hung above my face, a bead of precome oozing down, glistening towards my chin.



"Nah," Colin said, "why stop now, she's loving it."



As I began to move my lips, the pressure of Colin's finger increased, ending whatever words I might say.&nbsp;&nbsp; Fine, I thought.&nbsp; I was tapped out, the orgasm had blown me apart.&nbsp; If he wanted the dog to keep licking me....&nbsp;&nbsp; 



Finally, Ted couldn't take it any more, and pushed the dog out of the way.&nbsp; Thrusting his thick cock into me, he fucked me so hard the coffee table actually rocked before shooting his load deep up inside me.&nbsp; As he pulled out, and his sperm leaked out, the dog returned, licking away my cunt slime and Ted's semen.



"You know," Colin said dangerously, "fido here has been so good to Barb, I think she should return the favour."



I didn't dare respond to that with anything but a soft moan.



"What do you mean?"&nbsp; the nerd asked.&nbsp; "You want her to fuck the dog?"



No. No. No. No.&nbsp; I thought.&nbsp; It took everything I had not to stiffen my back at the thought.



"Maybe later," Colin replied easily.&nbsp;&nbsp; "But I don't think it needs to go that far.&nbsp;&nbsp; After all, he used her tongue on her...&nbsp; She should be willing to use her tongue on him."



He bent and whispered in my ear.&nbsp; "Fair is fair, Barb.&nbsp; Isn't that right?&nbsp; You want to be fair, don't you, Barb?"



Oh, the bastard.&nbsp;&nbsp; In a drugged out state, I'd barely grasp the context of that question.&nbsp; I could only agree with it.



I nodded.



That was good enough for him.



"See," he said, "she's into it.&nbsp; Bring him over this side."



They dragged the dog around, so his rear parts were towards my face.



Colin guided my limp arm towards its crotch.&nbsp;&nbsp; The dog moved away a little.&nbsp;&nbsp; He wasn't into it any more than I was.&nbsp;&nbsp; Good.&nbsp; I rolled towards him and 'fell' off the coffee table, with a loud crash.&nbsp; Colin cursed.



If you're limp and uncoordinated and really not into doing something, it can be easy to make it hard for someone to make you do it.&nbsp;&nbsp; I burst into giggles, I fell over, I missed.&nbsp; I got vague and distracted.&nbsp; I crawled around on the floor, barking.&nbsp; Colin got frustrated.



Of course, if he got too frustrated, he'd get determined.&nbsp;&nbsp; And if it came down to a contest of wills in the role that I was playing, all he had to do was be patient and sooner or later ...&nbsp; So I had to give in a bit.&nbsp; I let the dog lick me, sucking on Colin's cock, then the nerd's, jerking Ted off.&nbsp;&nbsp; It's tongue felt better than I wanted to admit.



As the dog licked, its cock extended.&nbsp; I couldn't help but stare.&nbsp; It was bright red, not shaped like a human penis at all.&nbsp; It was sort of like a big lipstick.&nbsp;&nbsp; Half at Colin's urging, half of my own curiousity, liberated by the play-acting of my drugged out state, I touched it, holding it loosely in my hands.&nbsp;&nbsp; It felt strange, smoother than a human cock, almost rubbery, almost wet, hotter than I expected.&nbsp; It throbbed in my hand, as the men watched, fascinated, aroused, hard as rocks.&nbsp; They were totally getting off on this obscene, forbidden degradation.&nbsp;&nbsp; It wouldn't be long, maybe seconds, before they had to fuck me, before their raging lusts would throw everything aside and plunge into my helpless body to spend their sexual fury in wet explosions that would drip and ooze from my holes.



Colin pushed me.&nbsp; Unsure how much further I could make myself go, I brought the dog's cock to my lips, tasting just the tip of it on my tongue, kissing it.&nbsp;&nbsp; And then I hit my limit.&nbsp;&nbsp; I started to giggle deliberately, and then rolled over on the floor.&nbsp; Colin grunted with frustration.



I got on all fours, face in the carpet, arching my back, wobbling and presenting my cunt.&nbsp;&nbsp; That was all they needed.&nbsp; Colin grabbed my ass, mounted and started thrusting hard into me.&nbsp; The nerd took me from the front, plunging his cock into my willing mouth, the two of them seesawing me back and forth as Ted watched waiting his turn, the dog forgotten.



After they'd all shot their load, leaving me a sodden, crumpled, semen oozing mess on the floor, they didn't care much about the dog.



As always, the cleaned me up, took me home, and tucked me safely in bed.



Of course, that wasn't the end....



A few days later, maybe a week, I woke up one morning, remembering nothing from the night before.&nbsp; But my cunt felt ... used.&nbsp;&nbsp; And when I slipped my finger inside and tasted it, it was ... different.&nbsp;&nbsp; Not the taste I associated with men's cocks or semen.



Fuck, I thought.&nbsp;&nbsp; They'd gotten me.&nbsp;&nbsp; As I stepped into the shower, I wondered how.&nbsp; I'd been watching them pretty closely.&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, I decided that they must have put it on the pizza slice.&nbsp; I thought the pepperoni was off.&nbsp; I'd have to watch out for that.



I wondered what had happened.&nbsp; What I had done?&nbsp; Had I come?&nbsp; The taste...&nbsp;&nbsp; I shrugged.&nbsp; No way to tell.



The next time, it was at my apartment.&nbsp;&nbsp; This time, I spotted it, dodged it, and slipped easily into the role play.



Slowly, as I 'sank' under, they moved in on me again, carefully undressing me, opening me as they had so many other times.&nbsp; But always exciting.



I was wet, of course, naked on the couch, sandwiched between them, each leg spread open, bent over their knees on either side, my cunt gaping and wet under their fingers.&nbsp; They played with my body from either side, hands sliding up, caressing breasts, pinching nipples.&nbsp; I moaned with pleasure, as first one then the other, kissed me, sliding their tongues into my mouth, both possessing me, one after the other, two sets of fingers working into my pussy and ass, opening me.&nbsp; My hands wrapped limply around their hard cocks, stroking them.



Colin produced a vibrator, and slid it up inside.&nbsp; I floated in a happy pre-orgasmic daze, passive, submissive, willing, will-less.



"I think it's time," Colin said finally.&nbsp;&nbsp; Ted nodded and left.



"Wherez he goin'" I mumbled.



"Shh," Colin whispered, working the vibrator against my clit.



"Tedddd...,"



"Who?"



"Tedddd..."



"Who?"



"Uhhhhh," the vibrator worked its magic.&nbsp;&nbsp; I wasn't supposed to remember.&nbsp;&nbsp; Fine.&nbsp; They had a surprise.&nbsp; I relaxed and let Colin use me, prepare me, make me wet and ready for whatever was coming.&nbsp; Ropes?&nbsp; Gear?&nbsp; A woman?&nbsp; Men?



The door opened.&nbsp; I didn't give any sign that I heard it, just continued to moan softly.



Ted came into the room with a dog on a leash.&nbsp;&nbsp; I gazed at it through lidded eyes.



Oh shit, I thought.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My stomach fluttering.&nbsp;&nbsp; Here we go again.



"Surprise," Colin said.



You bastard, I thought.&nbsp; But I was already getting wetter.



"Doggie," I said softly.&nbsp;&nbsp; In my 'state' I wouldn't be able to think coherently enough to associate what the presence of the dog with sex. 



"Yes," Colin said, "nice doggie." 



It was a german shepherd, I noticed.&nbsp; Different from the mutt before.&nbsp; Much bigger.&nbsp; Ted undid his fly, taking his hard cock out, and sat down on the other side of me.&nbsp; He pulled my leg over his knee, spreading my cunt wide, the two of them together, pushing my hips forward towards the edge of the couch. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Ted stuck his finger up my ass.&nbsp;&nbsp; They sandwiched me, holding me immobile, guiding my hands on to their respective hard cocks.&nbsp;&nbsp; My fingers wrapped around their erections, sinously stroking them, almost with wills of their own.



"Good girl," Colin whispered.



Ted pressed his mouth over mine, opening me, thrusting his tongue past my teeth.



"Barb," Colin ordered, "close your eyes and just relax.&nbsp; Just close your eyes, Barb.&nbsp; Relax."



I knew what was going to be coming.&nbsp; But I had no choice, spread and opened like a peace of meat.&nbsp; I closed my eyes, went limp.



Soon, the tongue started between my legs, as I knew it would.



Ted took his lips from mine.



"Open your eyes, Barb," Colin ordered.



There it was, the big dog, licking my pussy.



Surprise surprise.



It was pretty obvious to me.&nbsp; But of course, I was supposed to have been out of it on roofies.&nbsp; And in that state, I would have had no clue.&nbsp;&nbsp; How would I react, if I was really out of it?



I stared vaguely at the dog licking my pussy.&nbsp; Colin and Ted watched me, waiting for my reaction.



"Doggy," I said finally.



"Nice doggy," Colin whispered.



"Good doggy," Ted said.



"It feels good, doesn't it Barb, the doggy licking your pussy."



"Uh huh."



"Say it feels good, Barb."



"It feels good."



"What feels good, Barb?"



"The doggy...&nbsp; Licking my pussy."



"What about it, Barb?"&nbsp; Colin persisted, insisting.&nbsp; "How does it feel.&nbsp; Tell us."



"I like it."



"Good girl," Colin said.



"Good dog," Ted replied.



Oh those smug bastards.&nbsp;&nbsp; They had me trapped between them, my legs spread and held open over their knees, cunt exposed, even my hands were trapped.&nbsp; I couldn't move, held in place as completely as if I'd been hog tied while the dog licked and licked.



It was my second time now, being licked by a dog, so I was over the shock of it.&nbsp;&nbsp; The role that I played for them, of a drugged out slut with no memory formation, and reduced thinking, would and could only sit there passively and watch the dog lick her pussy.&nbsp; So that was all I could do.&nbsp; But that was okay, the second time around, I could relax and bear it.



Truthfully, I was enjoying it.&nbsp; The simple physical sensations were extremely pleasurable.&nbsp; All I had to do was focus on how it felt, and not on the fact that they were making a dog do it to me.&nbsp; I kept getting wetter and wetter.



I let myself moan and writhe softly, and there was nothing fake in it.



But I couldn't enjoy it completely.&nbsp; I knew Colin and Ted well enough to know it wouldn't stop there, they wouldn't stop there.&nbsp;&nbsp; The only question was how far they would try to take it.&nbsp; I found myself worrying about what would come next, what would inevitably come, and how I could avoid it...&nbsp; Or if I could avoid it...&nbsp; Or if I wanted to avoid it...&nbsp; Oh god, I was such a whore.



There was nothing I could do right now, they had me neatly trapped, paralyzed at their mercy and the mercy of this animal between my legs.&nbsp;&nbsp; All I could do was submit and wait for the next move.



Slowly, they took turns playing with me, as the dog's tongue did its work, heating me up.&nbsp; I squirmed and moaned, buried in my role, some part of me watching and waiting...



They let things take me to the edge of orgasm, and then pushed the dog away as I whimpered and whined.&nbsp; I wanted to plunge my hands between my legs, the orgasm was so close.&nbsp; But they held my wrist fast.&nbsp; After a moment, they let the dog return to lick me, only to repeat the process.&nbsp; It got so I begged them to let the dog finish me, begged for the dog to lick me.



"Hey Barb," Colin said, "return the favour, Barb."



Return the favour was too abstract a concept.



"Wha-?"



"He's licking your pussy, Barb," Colin prompted.&nbsp; "Isn't that right, Barb."



"Yesss."



"Then you should suck his cock."



"Nooo."



"That's not nice, Barb.&nbsp; You like what he's doing."



"Uhhh"



"You like it."



"Yeahhhh."



"You're not mean, Barb.&nbsp; Are you mean?"



"No...."



"But its mean, not to do something nice if someone does something nice for you, Barb, isn't that right?"



"Yes."



"You don't want to be mean, Barb?"



"No..."



"He has a nice cock, Barb."



"Oh..."



"He likes you, Barb."



"Uh...."



"You want to suck it, Barb."



"Uh..."



"Give him pleasure, Barb, for what he's doing for you."



"Ahhh ah..."



"You want to come, Barb?"



"Yesssss...."



"Suck his cock, it will make you come, Barb."



"Uhhhhh...."



"You want to do it, Barb."



"Ohhhh...."



"Say it Barb."



"I want to suck his cock..." I moaned, writhing.&nbsp;&nbsp; If I did, they would let me come, and I was half crazed with the need to come.&nbsp;&nbsp; And more than that, Ted and Colin's soft whispering suggestions and commands had crept into me.&nbsp; Even sober, the incessant suggestions wormed their way in, insinuated themselves like my own thoughts.&nbsp; In the role that I was playing, these thoughts would have slowly become all that was in my mind.&nbsp;&nbsp; I knew that there was no choice but to surrender, to ask for it, to beg for it.



Of course, I couldn't suck the dog's cock from this position.&nbsp; They'd have to let me move, or move me.&nbsp; I wondered if I'd have a chance to evade them with fake clumsiness and intoxication, the way I had last time.&nbsp; 



I wondered if I really wanted to.&nbsp; It would be so easy to go along, to play the role, to do as they willed.&nbsp; It was a dark undertow, threatening, promising, to drag me under for real.&nbsp; Since the last encounter, I'd had some time to get used to the idea... and that, together with my sexual haze, my craving need for satisfaction, stolen from the brink of orgasm...&nbsp; The idea of sucking a dogs cock didn't seem all that awful.&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps, it was even hot, in a nasty, filthy, degrading kind of way.&nbsp; I visualized myself with my mouth on that red shaft I'd touched the last time, and my cunt spasmed.



"You want to do it, Barb?"



"Yes."



"You want to suck that big, filthy dog cock, Barb?"



"Yes."



"You need to do it, Barb, don't you?"



"Yes, oh yes."



"You need that dog cock in your mouth, Barb."



"Yes...&nbsp;&nbsp; Ohhhhh."



"You need to taste it, Barb."



"Ohhh...&nbsp; Ohhhh..."



"Beg for it, Barb.&nbsp; Beg to suck that dog cock."



"Ohhhh."



Slap!



"Ah!"



"I said, beg, Bitch!&nbsp; Beg to suck that dog's cock if you want to come."



"Oh please..."



Slap!



"Please what, Bitch?&nbsp; Please, you want to suck it."



"Yes... please let me suck it, please I want to suck that hard dog cock... please, please..."&nbsp; I babbled mindlessly, only half in the role.&nbsp; They'd broken down my resistance totally.&nbsp; All I could think of was the utter wantonness, the primeval submission of servicing an animal for them.



"She's ready," Colin said, speaking as if I wasn't there.&nbsp;&nbsp; 



Ted moved away from me, pulling on the dog's leash.&nbsp;&nbsp; The dog left my pussy, resisting his leash but aimlessly, visibly excited.&nbsp; As he turned, I saw for the first time that his bright red, canine cock had erected beneath his legs, the long scarlet shaft bobbing.&nbsp; It was already dripping precome.&nbsp;&nbsp; 



"Here, Barb," Ted ordered, pulling me down as he moved down the couch until my head was in his lap.&nbsp;&nbsp; He pushed my head against the hard muscle of his thigh near his knee, holding it in place.



I understood that this time, there would be no falling, no squirming, that I'd be held in place.&nbsp; At my other end, Colin lifted one of my legs high, and played with my cunt with a vibrator, the sensations erratic and unpredictable.&nbsp; It made it hard to think.



"You want to suck it, Barb."&nbsp; He whispered.



"You want it in your mouth."



And I did, I really did.&nbsp; I needed it.



I reached out for the shaft, cradling it in my hand.&nbsp; Ted loosened his grip on my head.&nbsp; Still keeping a handful of my hair wrapped in his fist.&nbsp;&nbsp; This cock was bigger, inhuman in shape, tapering to a point without a glans that I could see.&nbsp; It was so hot in my hand, throbbing and spongy.&nbsp; My lips parted, pouted.



Oh god, I can't believe I'm doing this.



My lips closed on the dog's cock, and I gently drew it into my mouth.



As if from a great distance, I head Ted's voice.



"She's doing it."



And in answer, equally distant, but with deep satisfaction.&nbsp; 



"Of course she is.&nbsp; She wants it."



My face burned with shame, but I didn't stop sucking, drawing the shaft deeper, feeling the heat in my mouth, the salty sour taste of the precome, it was surprisingly coppery.&nbsp; I rolled my tongue along the shaft, feeling its texture.



Their voices faded away, I concentrated on not listening, not thinking.&nbsp; I concentrated on nothing but the hard member between my lips, refusing to think even of its owner.&nbsp;&nbsp; Suck it, I thought, serve it.&nbsp; Swallow its come.&nbsp;&nbsp; All I could do was take it, make it come.&nbsp; If he came in my mouth, it would be over, this part of it would be over, and it wouldn't go any further, at least not this time...



The cock swelled in my mouth, growing stranger and more alien, so unlike human cocks.&nbsp; The scent of the dog, so different, filled my nostrils.&nbsp;&nbsp; It started to hump, thrusting in my mouth.&nbsp; The angle was awkward, I gagged a little.



I was going to come, I was so close.&nbsp; I reached between my legs, began frantically rubbing my clit.



And then Ted pulled me off, leaving me blinking and delirious.



"That's enough, dog sucker," he laughed.



Colin brushed my fingers away from my clit, denying my orgasm.



"Showtime," he snickered.



They pushed me upright on the couch, until I was sitting up again.&nbsp; I reached down again, to rub my clit, but the pulled my hands away, spreading my legs wide so that my cunt gaped.



Ted pulled on the leash, and the dog mounted up on the couch, his forelegs on either side of my waste.&nbsp; The animal loomed over me.



"This time, Barb, you're going to take him from the front."



This time? 



The dog's narrow frame loomed above me, down to his hind legs on the floor in front of the couch.&nbsp; His erection dangled in front of me, still wet with my saliva, only inches from my cunt.



"Ease forward, Barb."&nbsp; 



I slouched down, spreading my legs wider, panting, my hips moving almost to the edge of the couch.



"Reach out, Barb," Colin ordered.&nbsp; "Take his cock in your hands."



Mindlessly, I complied.&nbsp; Feeling my fingers wrap around the dog's erection, guiding it towards me.



Oh god, what was I doing?



"Put his cock in you, Barb," Colin ordered, "so the dog can fuck you.&nbsp; You want it."



Oh god.



Stop, I told myself.&nbsp; Stop.



Even if they'd had a dog fuck me before, this time was different.&nbsp; I wasn't out of it, I wasn't mindless.&nbsp; If I put that dog cock in me, it would be me doing it.&nbsp; I would be choosing it.&nbsp; I wouldn't have the excuse that I was drugged, that I didn't remember.&nbsp; I would be doing it.&nbsp;&nbsp; I had to stop playing, stop acting, stop pretending.&nbsp; I wasn't pretending now, this wasn't a pretend dog, or a pretend cock.&nbsp; This was real, and if I did this, oh god no, I couldn't, I shouldn't, I won't.&nbsp; I'll stop...



But even as all these things went through my head, I found I couldn't break character, couldn't stop pretending to be the mindless slut.



But that wasn't it, that wasn't all.&nbsp;&nbsp; I knew that I couldn't do it, that I had to stop.



But I didn't.



I drew the dog cock between my spread legs, feeling spots of saliva from dog drool spattering my breasts, the coarse fur of his legs against my thighs.&nbsp; I felt the tip of his cock slide wet against my pussy, guided it to my entrance...



And it slid up inside me.



"Oh God," I whimpered aloud.



"His cock is in me," I moaned.



I heard Ted snapping pictures.



The cock started to move in me, as the dog began to hump, fucking me.&nbsp; I kept getting wetter and wetter, dripping, my legs spreading wider.



A snap of fingers in my face, and then a slap.



"Focus, Barb."&nbsp; Colin ordered.&nbsp; "Smile for the camera."



I stared straight at the camera, face drawn with lust, as the dog fucked me with increasing speed and fierceness and Ted recorded it in frame after frame.&nbsp;&nbsp; I stared down at the red shaft now surging in and out of my cunt, the animal body, its fur and frame now joined to mine.



"Oh god," I cried.



My orgasm, so long frustrated, building rapidly, I made an incoherent howling sound.



"Play with yourself, Barb."



My fingers dove between my legs, savagely abusing my clit as the dog cock thrust deeper and faster in me.&nbsp; I screamed out, trying to lift my hips, but being battered down by his violent thrusting, opened, penetrated, fucked and overwhelmed by the dog's hard cock.



I went limp as the orgasm blew itself out in me, leaving me feeling like soggy flotsam washed up on the storm.&nbsp;&nbsp; Colin took my wrist, and held it up against the back of the couch.&nbsp; Ted did the same with the other hand.



"He's not finished fucking you yet, Barb," Colin warned, twisting my nipple and making me writhe and gasp.&nbsp;&nbsp; I couldn't escape though, with my wrists pinned and the dog pounding its cock wildly into me, I was completely helpless.&nbsp;&nbsp; "And you're far from finished."



His hand reached down, playing roughly with my clit, rubbing it painfully.&nbsp;&nbsp; I whined, the harsh treatment of my clit mingling with the sensations from the animal cock desecrating my wet, inner recesses.



"I can't..."&nbsp; I cried.



"Can't what, Barb.&nbsp;&nbsp; Can't come from a dog fucking you?&nbsp; You just did.&nbsp; You love that dog cock, Barb."



"I can't come again," I whined.&nbsp; Oh god it was too much.&nbsp; The dogs pounding kept increasing, Colin's fingers were agony.



"You don't get to decide, bitch," Colin said.&nbsp; "I decide."



"Please..." I begged, it was getting hard to breath.&nbsp; I was getting dizzy.



Suddenly, I felt this wet rush filling me, and knew that the animal was coming, filling me with his hot semen.&nbsp; Colin jammed his fingers hard against my clit, making me cry out.&nbsp; And then, helplessly, I was coming again, coming from this brutal defilement, from this animal cock spurting dog sperm into my helpless cunt, and from Colin's punishment.&nbsp;&nbsp; The orgasm was so intense, I couldn't see, my awareness drained down to a single point, my cunt, even as it filled with hot semen.&nbsp; I thought I was going to pass out.



I panted helplessly, my breath so hoarse I could barely speak.&nbsp; My skin was full of goosebumps as fuck sweat cooled on my body.&nbsp;&nbsp; It was hard to put together a coherent thought.&nbsp;&nbsp; At least it was over.&nbsp; Or the worst part of it was over.



The dog's cock was still in me.&nbsp; The animal still straddled me.



"Want to know what comes next, Barb?"&nbsp; Colin asked, pleasantly.&nbsp;&nbsp; There were flashes.&nbsp; Ted was taking more pictures, but I was beyond caring.



I moaned incoherently.



His cock in me didn't feel smaller, if anything, it felt like it was growing.



"When a dog comes in a bitch, he has this thing called a knot.&nbsp; It's a bulge on his cock.&nbsp; It swells up and locks the bitch on, with his come up her, so he'll get her pregnant."



He patted my belly.



"Feel that Barb?&nbsp; That's the knot swelling up inside you."



Oh god.&nbsp; The import of his words cut through my daze.



"That knot is going to swell up inside you, Barb, until you're stretched, until it hurts.&nbsp;&nbsp; He'll pull on it, but you'll be locked, tied like a bitch.&nbsp; Maybe we'll take some pictures of you ass to ass on all fours, so everyone knows what a bitch you really are."



"Please," I whispered.



"It'll probably hurt a little," Colin said.&nbsp; "But don't worry, because that knot will be pressing hard against your g-spot and against the nerve center behind your clit, and its going to make you come again, Barb.&nbsp; He's going to wreck your cunt, but you're going to come as he tears you."



"Please," I whimpered, tears running down my face, "I can't, I can't come any more."



"You will," he ordered.



And I did.



After a while, after two more orgasms, the knot subsided and the dog pulled out.&nbsp; A gush of dog semen flooded out of my cunt, all over my couch, and down the floor.&nbsp;&nbsp; The reek of dog semen filled my nostrils, sour and pungent.



Ted tumbled me on the floor.&nbsp;&nbsp; I laid face down, utterly boneless.



"You want to fuck that?"&nbsp; Colin laughed.



"I bet her ass is still tight," Ted said.&nbsp;&nbsp; They took turns, fucking me up the ass.&nbsp; My body was so drained, there was no resistance at all, they sank into my bowels until they each discharged a heavy load.



After, they let me lapse into semiconscious torpor, as they cleaned up around me.&nbsp;&nbsp; Colin pulled me into the bathtub, hosing my body down with the shower unit, and douching my raw cunt and ass.



"What about the couch?"&nbsp; Ted called.



"What about it?"



"There's a pretty big fucking stain of dog come," Ted replied.



"Fuck it," Colin replied.



"She's going to wonder about the stain?"



"Fuck her," he replied.



They both laughed.



"She needs a little mystery in her life, she's always complaining about how bored she is, how dull everything is."



"I wonder if she'd think it was boring tonight."



No, I thought vaguely, as Colin toweled me off and got me into a pair of panties.&nbsp; Whatever tonight was, it wasn't boring.



He tucked me into bed, and I was asleep before they'd left.



The next day, I woke, sore once again.&nbsp; What an amazing fuck, I thought.&nbsp; I went to the bathroom, peed, and then went back to bed and slept the rest of the day.



Having fucked a dog, having been so thoroughly outmaneuvered by the geeks, that was a lot to process.&nbsp; It seemed hard to get my head around it, and yet I worried it relentlessly.&nbsp; I couldn't think of anything else.



I was disgusted with myself, as I thought of it.&nbsp; Completely ashamed.&nbsp; And yet, I couldn't help thinking about it.&nbsp; And couldn't help getting wet.&nbsp;&nbsp; My fingers would slide between my legs, and inevitably they would start to rub circles around my clit, and then all of a sudden I'd be coming so hard remembering how the dog had fucked me.



It was all out of control, I decided.&nbsp; Things were going to far, and if I let them go any further... I'd be so screwed.&nbsp; I had to pull the plug.&nbsp; And I had to do it now, while I was still able to.



I resolved to put this all behind me.&nbsp; I could stop, I would stop.&nbsp; I was still the one in control.



I'd get my life back together, start looking up my friends again, pull my grades up.&nbsp; Things would go back on track, I'd back to the plan... med school, doctor, seven figure income.



After a week, I dropped in on the guys with a pizza and a sixpack of beer...

















 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;















ROOFELESS 6





"We haven't seen you in a while, Barb," Colin asked.&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's up?"



"Oh you know," I said.&nbsp; "Busy."



"Yeah," he said.&nbsp;&nbsp; "Same here.&nbsp; But you just disappeared for a while there.&nbsp; Weren't answering the phone, nothing."



"A touch of flu," I said.



He nodded.



"I hear that's going around."



It had been a little more than a week since the dog.&nbsp; Against my better judgement, I'd showed up at Colin's with beer and a pizza.



He was just about to start cleaning up his apartment, when I arrived.&nbsp;&nbsp; So he invited me to help out before we kicked back and relaxed.&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, I thought, it's what friends do.&nbsp;&nbsp; But then he wound up making a phone call to Ted, and he was so busy talking, he couldn't do much more than supervise me, as I did his dishes and cleaned up around for him.&nbsp; He inspected my work after I cleaned the bathroom, and then ordered me to do it again, as if I was his maid.&nbsp;&nbsp; Amazingly, I didn't tell him to fuck off.



Instead, I found myself getting down on my hands and knees, my panties peaking out from my ultra-short skirt, the one with the slit up the side, scrubbing the floor.



It wasn't that bad, I told myself.&nbsp;&nbsp; I didn't really care about this petty shit, or whatever.&nbsp; I didn't really think about it.&nbsp; All I could think about was how they might fuck me.&nbsp; How I needed them to fuck me.



Ted came over.&nbsp; We had beer and pizza.&nbsp; We watched a crappy hockey game.&nbsp; I was bored to tears, almost jumpy.&nbsp; Wouldn't they try something?



Finally, I spotted one of their clumsy moves with a glass of water.&nbsp;&nbsp; I almost sighed with relief.&nbsp; During a big score, I poured some of the water behind the couch.&nbsp;&nbsp; 



I noticed them glancing meaningfully at the partially empty glass.



Oh, they were so fucking obvious.&nbsp;&nbsp; They didn't have a clue.



Later, while Colin was in the bathroom, and Ted playing with the remote, I ditched the rest of the water.&nbsp;&nbsp; Eventually letting them see the glass was empty.&nbsp; Again, their eyes focused on it.&nbsp; It was so easy to run circles around them.



Cat and mouse, I thought, and I was the secret cat.



A secret cat who needed a good, hard fucking.



Badly.



I mean, even if there was a dog again, I didn't care any more.&nbsp; I just needed it.



With practiced ease, I slipped into my role, pretending to all the increasing symptoms of roofie intoxication.&nbsp;&nbsp; They took the bait, their hands exploring me, mouths kissing me, undressing, and fingering me.



Panting, aching, I let them bend my naked body over the arm of the couch, my ass protruding, my breasts hanging down.&nbsp;&nbsp; With practiced ease, Ted bound my arms behind my back.



Colin stood in front of me, his erection inches from my face, running his hands through my hair.



"Funny thing, Barb," he said.&nbsp; "You are so fucking susceptible to roofies its amazing.&nbsp; Works every time."



He slipped his thumb into my mouth.&nbsp; I sucked on it eagerly.



"I mean, look at you now," he laughed.&nbsp; "You're loaded out of your mind.&nbsp; You're just totally out of it, just a mindless slut who needs her holes fucked.&nbsp;&nbsp; No thinking, no memory, just a perfect sex toy, a wet cunt and spread legs."



"But here's the interesting thing.&nbsp;&nbsp; I didn't put anything in your water.&nbsp; It was just water.&nbsp; What do you think of that, Barb."



My stomach knotted up, my blood ran cold.&nbsp; Chill horror swept through me.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What do I do?&nbsp;&nbsp; He's bluffing, I thought desperately, with more hope than logic.&nbsp; Play the part, don't break character, no matter what.



"Wha..." I mumbled.



"Pay attention, Barb."&nbsp;&nbsp; He laughed and slapped my face.&nbsp;&nbsp; "You brainless cunt."



Todd jammed three fingers rudely in my wet pussy and slapped my ass.&nbsp; I bucked a little, glad for the distraction.&nbsp; 



He was playing a game with me, I was sure.&nbsp; He was trying to trick me.&nbsp; My only way out was to keep playing the part.&nbsp; He's still talking to me like I'm under.



"As a matter of fact, Barb," he said, chillingly,&nbsp; "there's a bunch of times when we only pretended to slip something to you... Just like you pretended to take it."



"After a while," Ted said from behind me, "we just started to figure that we'd save them for special occasions on you."



"Don't worry, Barb.&nbsp; We've got them on videotape.&nbsp; You'll get to watch."



"She'll love the dog tape."



Colin continued to run his fingers through my hair, gently, ever so gently.&nbsp;&nbsp; They're psyching me, I thought.&nbsp;&nbsp; It was a nightmare.&nbsp; This couldn't be real.&nbsp; My cunt spasmed, wetness almost running down my thighs.&nbsp; My whole body was tingling.&nbsp; Why wouldn't they just fuck me!



"You see, Barb," Colin said, "you aren't as smart as you think you are.&nbsp; You're not really very smart at all.&nbsp;&nbsp; In fact, you're kind of shallow, and self absorbed, and ignorant.&nbsp; You're just a brainless cunt, really, deep down."



"Please fuck me," I whispered.&nbsp; Was that in character?&nbsp;&nbsp; I needed it so badly.



"You just stumbled on to some scheme that you could use to get the kind of treatment you needed, the treatment you craved, and still keep all your shallow little illusions about yourself.&nbsp; We had no problem with that.&nbsp; We were happy to give you what you needed, and let you go on pretending."



"It was funny, actually.&nbsp;&nbsp; We got a laugh out of you.&nbsp;&nbsp; All the time you were laughing at us, we were laughing at you.&nbsp; Because we knew that in the end, you would always end up on your knees, sucking our cocks...&nbsp;&nbsp; Because we knew that in the end, that was what you really wanted."



"We love fucking you, Barb," he told me.&nbsp;&nbsp; "We love fucking you, and coming up with new ways to fuck you."



"Are you feeling fucked right now, Barb?"&nbsp; Ted asked behind me.&nbsp; "Just wait."



"We think its time to take you to your next level of being fucked, Barb," Colin said, his hand winding and tightening in my hair.&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's why we want you to know."



Oh god, I thought, it was all true.&nbsp;&nbsp; All the time I thought I'd been the one in control, the one playing them.&nbsp; But I'd been wrong.&nbsp;&nbsp; They'd been in control, they'd been playing me.&nbsp; The thought was devastating.&nbsp; I felt hollow inside.



"Remember all the times Ted or I made passes at you," Colin said.&nbsp;&nbsp; His grip on my hair tightened.&nbsp; It was starting to work.&nbsp;&nbsp; "And you shot us down."



"We didn't mind.&nbsp;&nbsp; I mean, either of us wouldn't have minded being your boyfriend.&nbsp; But that was never what you wanted.&nbsp; It wasn't what you needed.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And it wasn't ever what you really were to us... or we were to you."



"What are we, Barb," Colin said.&nbsp;&nbsp; I could feel Ted's thick cock behind me, pressing against my anus.&nbsp;&nbsp; After all his violations, he fucked my ass now as easily as my mouth.&nbsp;&nbsp; I pressed back a little, welcoming him, encouraging him to take me.&nbsp; His cock moved easily, sliding on his powerful hips.



"What are we, Barb," Colin said again.&nbsp;&nbsp; "I think you know.&nbsp;&nbsp; I want to hear you say it."



Tears began to roll down my face. 



This was a nightmare. 



"Come on, Barb," Colin coaxed.



One word.



"Masters," I whispered.



And with that word, I felt Ted enter me from behind.&nbsp;&nbsp; Colin lifted my head, and for a second, I saw him smiling down at me, and then I closed my eyes as he smoothly propelled his big hard cock between my lips and down my throat.



"Welcome to the rest of your life, Barb."&nbsp;
