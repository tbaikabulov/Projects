The Chronicles of Jerry O�Connell 
This is the second part of an intended chronicle detailing the works of a rather 
  unpleasant man by the name of Jerry O�Connell. ( the first part being �The Object 
  of His Affection�) Jerry is a physician, of sorts, who deals in the art of women, 
  modifying them to suit the needs of his clients. He has a long and sordid history, 
  which should be detailed in future installments. Some installments of this chronicle, 
  such as this, will feature Jerry as a major character, while others will not. 
  The storyline will, obviously, dictate this.
Before I continue, I must pay honors to Michael Moorcock, one of my favorite 
  fantasy authors. It was from a series of books called �The Cornelius Chronicles� 
  that I got the odd doctor�s name and the inspiration for the banner under which 
  these stories will fit.
I will admit that this story is a bit of an experiment. Also, future installments 
  will be a bit repetitive as I intend on making each one independent, so as not 
  to lose new readers as I chronicle each �adventure�. 
I also wish to thank �Banfann�, an author of absurdly excellent tales within 
  this genre. His latest series �The Exposition of Modified Women� is one of great 
  imagination. Before seeing this series I had imagined this tale to be quite 
  long, and I was severely struggling with it. His display, that shorter can sometimes 
  be better gave me the necessary mindset to present this as a short. 
Finally, as this is an experiment, future installments will rely greatly on 
  reader responses. I�ve no plan in beating this horse onward if it is dead, no 
  matter how much I am enjoying its misery. That said, I present to you, dear 
  reader, the second installment of �The Chronicles of Jerry O�Connell�.

  One Man�s Art

  Prologue:
The girl on the closed circuit monitor was beautiful. Her long auburn hair 
  and flashing gray eyes gave way to a face of pristine innocence, coupled with 
  fiery sexuality. She was one of those rare girls who had �It�. Her bust was 
  full and proud, standing out from her chest at constant and full attention. 
  Her slim waist gave way to robust and full hips, and led to long muscular legs, 
  capped off by a posterior that seemed impossibly round and full. If an artist 
  had depicted the perfect woman, it would have been her. Yet, she was here to 
  be changed, modified forever.
Jerry broke his gaze from the monitor and thumbed the file at hand. A long 
  time client had brought her in for modification. Clearly, this was to be another 
  of his household treasures. Exactly what, he had no idea as yet. So it was that 
  he departed his office and made his way to receive his guest.
�Francis, how are you?� Jerry issued as he cheerfully entered the client waiting 
  room. 
The girl was seated in a restraint chair beside a well-dressed man. She had 
  been carefully bound arms, legs and head to the sturdy chair. A gag fit into 
  her mouth, cutting off any possibility of speech. She watched, fearfully, as 
  the men joined in discussion.
�I see you have another girl for us to work on for you. Though, I am curious 
  what you could want this time. Your house must be full of our creations.�
Francis smiled, proffering a hand to the man in the white cravat. He had never 
  seen Jerry fail to wear it and wondered if it were attached to him. �I�ve something 
  a little different in mind, Jerry.�
�Let�s see, we have made a chair, a desk, a coffee table, a lamp�we even crafted 
  a nice couch for you out of a couple of girls you brought in�, Jerry stated, 
  reading from the contents of the manila folder he carried. �We are even making 
  a statue for you. What else could you want?�
The girl�s eyes grew wide with Jerry�s utterances. She tugged at her bindings, 
  her attempted screams issuing forth like a ragged voiced seagull.
�Art�, answered the man. �I have furniture, but no art for my wall.�
�She seems to be a work of art already�, Jerry replied. �What could you possibly 
  have in mind?�
�Have a look�, Francis said, pulling a piece of paper from his coat pocket. 
  �I want that.�
�This is quite an interesting drawing. Where do you intend on putting it?� 

�It should go in my main room.� Francis responded. �Right in the middle, where 
  it can be admired properly. Can you do it?�
�You�ll need to alter the room a bit. A piece like this needs a place to house 
  the waste disposal unit and the other electrical equipment that goes with it. 
  You will also need to be able to access it readily, to maintain it. It can be 
  done, though�, Jerry said as he folded up the drawing and slipped it into his 
  pocket.
Francis smiled, knowingly. �I�m way ahead of you, Jerry. I already have the 
  plans drawn up and inspected. It should be ready in six weeks. How long do you 
  think it will take you to finish it?�
�It�ll take a few months. The healing after the internal processing can be 
  most time consuming�, Jerry told him. �Everyone heals in their own time, so 
  I can�t be sure; except for allowing that it will take at least three months. 
  Immobilization might be a problem�at least parts of it. Incidentally, do you 
  want to allow any head movement or should that be immobilized, as well?�
More motion and muffled screams from the girl caught the men�s attention. Francis 
  thought for a moment as his gaze met that of the frightened girl. 
�I�ll leave that to you. I trust your judgment. I am certain that when you 
  have finished, she will be an excellent piece of art.�
Jerry smiled at the man, offering his hand. �I�ll call you with the necessary 
  measurements as soon as they are worked out.�

  Chapter 1
 
The girl lay naked on the bed, arms and legs well restrained. She had given 
  up screaming long since, figuring her best and only method of escape would be 
  one of negotiation. The room in which she was housed was now empty, those who 
  brought her in having left long ago. It was a well-lit room, cold and white, 
  featureless but for the array of lights which shone brightly above her.
During her trip from the initial processing room to the room in which she now 
  waited, she had observed several creations that were under process. A weeping 
  girl with posts protruding from her shoulders had been fit with artificial limbs. 
  Another was possessed of breasts that were far too large for her stature. Yet 
  another had been molded as a statue, vulgarly servicing two satyrs. 
She closed her eyes, concentrating on what she might say to whoever would listen. 
  She would be calm, she told herself. Her argument would be rational and thoughtful. 
  She would explain how she should not be turned into a piece of art. Her family 
  had money; more money than most people dreamed of. She would bribe her captor 
  with that. Should that fail, she could always offer some sort of sexual favor 
  if they would only let her go. She would get out of her predicament�she had 
  to.
Jerry�s entrance broke her from her thoughts. He was smiling, still wearing 
  the white cravat she had seen him in some days before. She spoke behind her 
  gag, hoping he would remove it. Understanding her garbled want he nodded his 
  head and removed the gag.
�Please let me go. My parents have money�they can pay you more than what he 
  is paying�, she begged.
Jerry smiled down at her, his face becoming sympathetic. �How old are you?�
�I�m eighteen. I just turned eighteen a month ago�, she said, her voice desperate, 
  sad and fearful.
�Well, child�I am sorry for you. But it�s already decided. You are going to 
  adorn his wall for the next�well, for a long time. Do you know what you are 
  to be?�
She studied his face for a moment, noting the sympathy in his eyes. �No�no, 
  I don�t�
�You are going to be cast in a frame. You will be the artwork it holds�, he 
  told her.
�What do you mean�like a painting?� the girl asked, astounded at the notion.
�Quite�but more than a painting�, he replied. �I dare say you will become a 
  most stunning piece of art, my dear.�
�I have money�my parents have money�whatever he�s paying you we can pay more! 
  Please don�t do this�, she cried.
�It�s already done, my dear. You are going to be what you are going to be.�
Again, the girl pleaded. �What do you want? You can fuck me�I�ll blow you. 
  Anything!�
�Quiet now, my dear�, Jerry shushed her. �Open you mouth so I can replace the 
  gag.�
�Please�, she cried. �I�ll be quiet.�
�Don�t make this harder, my dear. Resistance is not going to make things any 
  easier.�
Resigned to the fact that she had little choice in the matter, she relented. 

Just then a man with glasses and clipboard entered the room. Like Jerry, and 
  everyone else she had seen, he wore a white cravat. �What�s the plan, Jerry?�
�Artificial teeth � white� he started. �After that, a full internal processing; 
  sterilization, redirect her urinary tract and the anal valve. Her breasts are 
  fine, so we won�t make any changes there.�
The man was scribbling behind his clipboard, ignoring the girl as she screamed 
  behind her gag, as Jerry spoke. �Anything else?�
�Yes�, he said, pulling Francis� drawing from his pocket. �Have one of our 
  artists draw this up on a large scale. I need measurements and solutions to 
  whatever problems he thinks might arise. Also, I need suggestions as to the 
  best way to accomplish this. Also, I don�t want her to be immobile�I want to 
  allow for movement. I think it will set off the piece nicely if it has life.�
The man scurried off, taking the picture with him.

Chapter 2

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

The girl woke from her dreams, imagining that she was safe
in her bed. Stretching, she opened her eyes to find that she was not at home
but in a room that was completely foreign. Sitting up, she surveyed the room
around her. It was white and completely devoid of furnishings. The only
distinctive characteristics about the room were the two doors, one with a sign
that clearly marked it as the bathroom. The other door, she knew, led to a
horror beyond belief.

&nbsp;

Quickly surmising that she had no way of fashioning an
effective weapon from her mattress and bed sheets, she decided to find if there
were something she could use from the bathroom. Unfortunately, the bathroom was
empty as her sleeping quarters, having only a roll of tissue, the toilet and the
sink. As she exited the room she was graced with the presence of Jerry and two
other men, clad in white cravats.

&nbsp;

�What do you want?� she shot at Jerry, covering her
nakedness to the best of her abilities.

&nbsp;

�Come with us, my dear�, he ordered.

&nbsp;

�Fuck you!� she responded.

&nbsp;

If anyone had witnessed the battle between men and girl,
they would have said that she gave a good account of herself, having knocked
one of the men to the floor with a picture perfect right cross. However, the
outcome was inevitable and she soon found herself strapped to a gurney and
wheeled into the processing chamber. In short order she was unconscious and
undergoing the first in a series of procedures that would change her life
forever. 

&nbsp;

Many hours later she was wheeled, still unconscious, into
the recovery room and attached to an IV. It would be several weeks before she
would be allowed to awaken from her drug induced slumber. 

&nbsp;

When, finally, she was allowed to regain consciousness it
was to find that she was alone and in the very same room where she had battled
Jerry and two of his staff members. Remembering Jerry�s words, she quickly took
stock of herself. Nothing she could find indicated that anything had been done
to her and she began to wonder if it was not all a cruel joke.

&nbsp;

�My teeth�he said he was going to�� she thought. A quick
examination of her teeth found no anomalies. Still she was unsatisfied. Leaving
her bed, she discovered that she was not quite herself, the long period of
sedation and inactivity taking its toll. Righting herself after nearly tumbling
to the floor, she slowly made her way to the bathroom, hoping to find a mirror
in which she might more thoroughly examine her teeth. To her disappointment
there was no mirror. What she found, however, was quite odd. The toilet was no
longer there. In its stead was a small padded seat. From the middle of the seat
protruded an odd tapered shaft. Just then, she turned, hearing the creak of her
room�s front door, to see Jerry entering her room. Slowly, and on unsteady
legs, she made her way out of the bathroom, a questioning look on her face as
she moved her hands to cover her intimate areas. 

&nbsp;

�What did you do to me?� she asked him, clearly perplexed at
finding no visible changes.

&nbsp;

�What�s your name, my dear?� Jerry was smiling at her.

&nbsp;

�Lindsey. I thought�what did you do�how long have I been�?�
she began.

&nbsp;

�I�m sure you�ve noticed that the toilet is not as it was
before�, he started, interrupting the girl. �You will need to be instructed as
to how to use it. And you will have to use it, Lindsey. Now, you want to know
what we�ve done, eh?�

&nbsp;

She looked on at the man, not understanding what use she
might have with the odd shaft.

&nbsp;

�Well, my dear, your urinary tract has been routed to your
colon. Your colon has been fit with a valve to prevent any mishaps and your
anal sphincter has been replaced with a sort of elastic �O� ring�, he stated
flatly. �You have been sterilized�actually, you have had�well, I won�t go into
too many details. Suffice to say that your breasts and vaginal opening are all
that remain of your womanhood.�

&nbsp;

Horrified, she looked on, tears forming in her eyes as Jerry
continued.

&nbsp;

�Your teeth and gums have been replaced with a realistic
synthetic, so as to avoid future dental problems�, he continued. �Also, your
intestinal tract has been modified rather severely. We also took the liberty of
removing your appendix. There is a bit more to it than that, but that is the
upshot. This is usually the first process we put our creations through since it
is the most traumatic. Oh, it�s been roughly six weeks since the surgeries.�

&nbsp;

The girl had sunk to the floor as Jerry had spoken of the
changes made to her. Now, head in hands, she wept. 

&nbsp;

�I realize that this is difficult for you�, Jerry said,
sounding sympathetic. �But, you must understand that it is all necessary before
we complete the next portion of your processing. I suspect that, once you find
your place in our client�s home, you will think of yourself as relatively
lucky.�

&nbsp;

�Lucky?� she asked, incredulously. �How can I be lucky after
all you have done to me? You bastard! You fucking prick! How could you do this
to me?�

&nbsp;

Ignoring her angry comments, Jerry began again. �After I
leave the room an orderly will bring you your meal. It is important that you
drink it down. After a few hours you will notice some discomfort. You will feel
a bit gassy, for lack of a better term. 

This is an indication that you will need to void your body
of wastes��

&nbsp;

The girl listened to the man, absorbing his words through
the jolts and jerks of her tears, mortified at his instructions for using the
post in the bathroom. 

&nbsp;

�You expect me to put that post up my ass and give myself an
enema?� she screamed. �Fuck you�fuck you!�

&nbsp;

�My dear, Lindsey� he said, �If you don�t you will die a
terribly painful death.�

&nbsp;

�Then I�ll die. I would rather die than end up as some piece
of�furniture for some perverts pleasure!� she screamed.

&nbsp;

�So be it�, Jerry spat as he spun and headed out the door.

&nbsp;

Some minutes after Jerry�s departure, the door creaked open.
Lindsey watched as a tall woman approached her, placing a bottle in front of
her. �Dinner�, said the woman before departing.

&nbsp;

For the next several hours, Lindsey ignored the bottle,
refusing to drink from it. Eventually, she gave in to her body�s needs and,
after removing the lid, drank the slightly sweet tasting contents, throwing the
bottle against the door as she swallowed the last of it. Then, exhausted from
her trauma, she retired to the mattress from which she had recently awakened.

&nbsp;

She woke to find that, just as Jerry had predicted, she felt
a mild discomfort in her belly. Refusing to take action she let it build.
Before many hours had passed she was feeling a terrible pain. Still, she was
determined that she would die before she would sit on the terrible phallus in
the bathroom. Eventually, however, it was more than she could take and she
decided to end her suffering.

&nbsp;

She stared for many minutes at the horrible post, generating
the courage to seat herself upon it. Much of her thoughts dwelled on her
preference for death. But the pain grew too great and, before long, she found
herself sliding the horrible thing into her posterior opening. Strangely, she
noted, it was not painful. In fact, she could barely feel it. After she heard
the pop that Jerry had told her would indicate she was properly seated she
reached down and pushed the lever that would release her from her pain.

&nbsp;

The sudden outward flow was nearly instantaneous. So was the
sudden inward flow of warm liquid that followed. Surprised by the uncomfortable
inward flow, she attempted to flee the horrible post but found that she could
not. She was, for all intents and purposes, trapped on the device. She reached
out, one hand against the wall and the other on the sink. Bracing her legs, she
attempted to flee the device that was pumping liquid inside of her body. 

&nbsp;

�Please�my God, please�� she pleaded to no one, struggling
to free herself from the device holding her fast.

&nbsp;

Still fighting against the device, she felt the
uncomfortable fullness leave her, the liquid being sucked out of her. Just
then, a beep sounded, startling her. Then, as quickly as she had become trapped
on the horrible phallus, she was freed from it. Slowly, she made her way from
the bathroom to her bedding, where she buried her face in her pillow, crying at
the horrible thing she had been forced to do.

&nbsp;
Chapter 3
For the next several weeks, she was put through a regiment of exercise. She 
  protested initially, finally cooperating after reasoning that exercise was far 
  better than the interminable boredom she faced doing nothing in her room. 
After several weeks of exercise, during which her body regained much of the 
  muscle tone it had lost during her long time under sedation, Jerry, accompanied 
  by the men who had overtaken her previously, visited her once again. Her struggles 
  on this occasion were no less desperate. Nor were they any more successful.
As she was being wheeled into the room where she was to be fitted with more 
  modifications, she began pleading with her captors again. More offers of money 
  and sex were made, as were threats and promises of retribution. These were met 
  with amused glances and low chuckles.
Jerry left her side as they entered the room, inspecting the instruments to 
  be used during this next procedure. After ensuring that everything was as it 
  should be, he turned to a small plastic box, filled with what appeared to be 
  tiny silver tubes. Turning to her, he smiled an imperious smile, bringing one 
  of the small tubes to bear.
&#8220;You&#8217;ll notice that these fittings are threaded inside. You&#8217;ll 
  find out why later. I want it to be a bit of a surprise&#8221; he began. &#8220;You 
  will also notice the small holes in the side. What we are going to do, thanks 
  to the genius of our art and engineering department, is imbed these into your 
  skeletal structure. Notice the small lip at the end? This one will be embedded 
  into your fingertip, the pin will fit through the bone and the tube, ensuring 
  it doesn&#8217;t shift or pull out. Others will be embedded in strategic places 
  through out your body. Of course, this will require a bit of reinforcement to 
  your skeletal structure, but I don&#8217;t wish to bore you with the finer details.&#8221;
As expected, the girl began ranting again. Her voice only dying out as the 
  applied anesthesia took effect.
As before, she was kept sedated for some weeks after her procedure had been 
  completed. No chances were taken with the healing process. Jerry had deemed, 
  long ago, that keeping their projects under sedation following such traumatic 
  procedures was both beneficial and necessary.
She was lying on her back when her eyes fluttered open. After many groggy minutes 
  of ceiling staring, she felt the need to expel her wastes. So, leaving the comfort 
  of her mattress, she walked to the bathroom and seated herself upon the hated 
  tube that would alleviate her discomfort. 
After eliminating her wastes she returned to her bed, pulling the sheets around 
  her. It was then that she saw the shiny metal lip of the threaded metal tubing 
  that had been embedded in her fingertips. Frantic at the sight of her finger&#8217;s 
  modification she began a long adventure of discovery. After a long and thorough 
  self-examination she threw herself down on her bedding, to cry into her pillow. 
  The implants, it seemed to her, were everywhere.
Over the next few days, great attention was paid to her new changes. Every 
  six hours, nurses would come in and inspect the new additions to her body. These 
  were the only breaks in the monotony of her time in the room and she began to 
  look forward to them. The nurses would chat with her as they inspected her, 
  making certain that none of the implants had shifted or became infected. Most 
  carefully they inspected the inserts in her feet, since walking on them would 
  make them the most likely candidates to develop complications. Fortunately, 
  the inserts proved to be quite sturdy and she showed no sign of infection or 
  rejection.
After several weeks of inspections, it was deemed that she was ready to take 
  the next step in her processing. The engineering department had completed their 
  end of the task and she was ready to be merged into their creation. It was on 
  this day that Jerry entered the room, smiling as usual and accompanied by the 
  men who had subdued her on two previous occasions.
Knowing the inevitable, she did not fight, nor did she attempt to hide her 
  nakedness. She had expected to be strapped down, once again. Instead, and much 
  to her surprise, she was led out of the room on her own two feet. Upon leaving 
  the room, one of the men applied a thick metal collar to her neck, commenting 
  to Jerry that projects should be fit with such a device immediately upon entering 
  the Facility. Jerry only chuckled at the man as he rubbed his jaw in memory 
  of the right cross the girl had felled him with.
She was led down several different corridors, passing the room where her most 
  recent procedure had been performed, before entering into a room that was far 
  larger than any she had seen thus far. Along the far wall and resting on a wide 
  platform, was a metal picture frame of intricate design.
&#8220;It&#8217;s eight feet tall, six feet wide and two feet deep&#8221;, 
  Jerry told her as they approached the construct.
Staring at up at the frame she took note of the many gunmetal gray spokes hanging 
  along the frames inner edge. They were no more than an eighth of an inch thick 
  and she wondered at their purpose. The spokes were most noticeable along the 
  top of the frame as they dangled and danced, chiming against each other in a 
  dull metallic symphony.
Just then, a man wearing a white jumpsuit approached them. &#8220;What do you 
  think, Jerry?&#8221;
&#8220;Excellent work, Bill&#8221;, Jerry told the man. &#8220; I just hope 
  we have the lengths right.&#8221;
Smiling, the man winked at Jerry, &#8220;That&#8217;s what this session is 
  for. To make any necessary adjustments.&#8221; 
&#8220;Of course&#8221;, returned Jerry.

Chapter 4 

  The girl stood atop a wide platform, just inside the large picture frame. After 
  a moment of uncertainty, she noticed that the man had positioned himself on 
  the same platform immediately behind her. Then, reaching up to the top of the 
  box, he freed a long spoke from its secured position above her, letting it hang 
  behind her. 
&#8220;Hold still&#8221;, he told her, placing his arm around her, his hand 
  on her naked belly. 
She was shocked by the familiarity at which the man placed his and on her stomach. 
  Then she felt him begin threading the dangling spoke into one of the many implants 
  in her back.
&#8220;No!&#8221; she cried out, bolting forward.
The man in the jumpsuit grasped her firmly as she began her flight, causing 
  them to tumble to the floor in a heap. She struggled hard to break free from 
  the man. Just then, a terrible pain struck her. She screamed and doubled up 
  into a ball on the cold floor. The pain subsided momentarily and then began 
  again.
&#8220;That&#8217;s what the collar is for, my dear&#8221;, Jerry informed 
  her. &#8220;We need your cooperation&#8230;well, we don&#8217;t need it. But 
  it certainly is easier if we do have it. I would very much appreciate your cooperation.&#8221;
&#8220;Fuck you!&#8221; she screamed. 
&#8220;I was afraid of this&#8221;, Jerry sighed, clicking the collar&#8217;s 
  remote. &#8220;That was just the low pain setting. I guess it&#8217;s time to 
  try a higher one.&#8221;
She convulsed, violently, screaming loudly as the collar around her neck sent 
  a powerful electrical current through her. Jerry watched, seemingly disinterested, 
  occasionally glancing at his watch&#8217;s second hand. Finally he relented, 
  offering her relief if she would cooperate. Met with a disappointing response, 
  Jerry triggered the collar another time, watching his timepiece as she writhed; 
  screaming, where she lay.
&#8220;Is that enough for you, my dear, or shall we try again?&#8221; he asked 
  the girl.
&#8220;Please&#8230;no more&#8221;, she whimpered.
&#8220;Then I will expect you to cooperate with us. Do we have a deal?&#8221;
&#8220;Yes&#8230;just don&#8217;t&#8230;please&#8230;I just need&#8230;&#8221; 
  she let out, her voice filled with defeat.
&#8220;Very well then&#8221;, Jerry said. &#8220;You&#8217;ve about sixty seconds 
  to recover. After that, I expect full cooperation.&#8221;
Her minute passed quickly, after which she was repositioned on top of the platform. 
  Then she felt the familiar warmth of the man&#8217;s hand on her belly as he 
  began attaching the dangling spoke to her back. When the man had finished with 
  his initial task, she had eight strands of metal spokes finding purchase in 
  her ribs, just beside her spinal column, and fanning out to attach to the top 
  and sides of the frame.
After repositioning himself to the girl&#8217;s right, he reached out to the 
  side of the box and drew out another shorter spoke. &#8220;Right arm, out and 
  up&#8221;, he said to her. 
&#8220;Please&#8230;&#8221; the girl said, only to find a sharp tingle emanating 
  from the collar on her neck.
Prompted by the light reminder, she obeyed the man, reaching out towards him. 
  The man took her index finger in hand, pulling her towards him, somewhat. Then, 
  as she expected, he threaded a spoke into the insert in her fingertip. Horrified, 
  she watched as, finger by finger, she was slowly incorporated into the workings 
  within the picture frame.
&#8220;Why are you doing this?&#8221; she cried to Jerry, staring at her right 
  hand. &#8220;Please stop. Let me go.&#8221;
The man in the white jumpsuit repositioned himself, yet again; this time to 
  her left. Again, he ordered she raise her arm towards him. Crying, she obeyed, 
  her despair becoming greater by the moment, aided by her growing humiliation 
  at aiding her captors. One by one, she watched each of her fingers become one 
  with the metal spokes.
Stepping from the platform, the man came to stand in front of the girl, noting 
  to Jerry that she looked like a worshipper awaiting the coming of God. 
&#8220;How tight is she?&#8221; Jerry asked the man.
&#8220;Not very&#8221;, he blurted. &#8220;But the spoke tension can be adjusted. 
  Once we have her completely engaged, we will make adjustments.&#8221;
&#8220;What about the cross pieces? I want those to look real&#8221;, Jerry 
  told the man.
&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry, the cross pieces are going to look real. Like the 
  spokes, they are made of a titanium alloy that is highly flexible&#8221;, he 
  said. &#8220;Once we have the measurements completed and the cross pieces attached, 
  we are going to spray it with a polymer to keep it from rattling and to add 
  the proper visual.&#8221;
&#8220;Excellent&#8221;, Jerry was practically beaming. &#8220;Well, you might 
  as well finish up. We have a rather anxious client awaiting this piece.&#8221;
Some two hours later, the work was complete. The men stepped back to admire 
  their captive, who now hung in the middle of the frame, her entire weight now 
  being supported by the frame&#8217;s metal spokes. 
&#8220;You look lovely, my dear&#8221;, Jerry told her. &#8220;You were wonderful. 
  I truly appreciate you cooperating so well.&#8221;
As miserable as she had been, Jerry&#8217;s words cut into her, filling her 
  with shame and humiliation. Though she had fought, she knew she should have 
  fought harder. What was the pain compared to this torture, after all? It was 
  nothing. And yet, she cooperated. She was, she felt, as guilty as anyone.
Her self-loathing was cut short by a loud mechanical noise. Unseen above her, 
  a man had begun ratcheting the spokes. First one and then another was ratcheted. 
  Slowly, she felt herself being pulled taught. Finally, when the tension was 
  deemed proper, she was commanded to move. Obeying, she felt herself shake amidst 
  the strands of metal.
&#8220;That&#8217;s perfect&#8221;, Jerry blurted. &#8220;Now, check the placement 
  of the implant in the back of her head to the top center spoke and get it ready. 
  I intend on delivering her next week.&#8221;
Entering the frame from its rear, Bill began screwing a swivel into the back 
  of her head. Then, after having her lean her head back, he clipped a small swivel 
  to the strand directly behind the attached swivel and began threading the two 
  together. 
&#8220;Alright, do you have it all?&#8221; Jerry asked the foreman.
&#8220;Got it&#8221;, he replied.
&#8220;Good, let&#8217;s get her down so you can get to finishing this little 
  project&#8221;, Jerry said.
Back in her room, Lindsey lay on her bed crying. For long and long she pondered 
  her fate, wondering how she could have cooperated as she had. She had held up 
  one hand and then the other. Then, as if that had not been bad enough, she had 
  done the same with each leg, allowing herself to be manipulated as if she were 
  a puppet. 
&#8220;It won&#8217;t happen again&#8221; she thought. &#8220;I&#8217;ll die 
  first!&#8221;
Her time to contemplate her recent trauma was short lived. A woman entering 
  her room commanded she get up and follow behind her. Then, turning from the 
  girl, she held up the remote to her collar, requesting she not be forced to 
  use it. Knowing it was futile and purposeless to disobey, she followed the woman. 

&#8220;This is your last stop&#8221;, she told the girl, motioning for her 
  to take to the bed in the room&#8217;s middle. Once atop the bed, she was strapped 
  down and anesthetized.

 Chapter 5 
She screamed upon waking to find that her beautiful hair had been removed. 
  Her screams went unheard, however, due to the strange obstruction she felt in 
  her throat. Her ability to speak had not entirely disappeared; she had screamed. 
  However, she found that her voice no longer had any volume beyond a loud whisper.
It was several hours later that Jerry came to her room. &#8220;It&#8217;s almost 
  time, my dear. Now stand up so I can have a good look at you.&#8221; 
&#8220;What did you do to me?&#8221; she whispered, sitting up on her bed. 
  &#8220;Why did you shave my head? What did you do to my voice?&#8221;
&#8220;Stand up&#8221;, he repeated, displaying her collar&#8217;s remote. 
  She was shaking, tears flowing from her eyes as she stood, fearful of the pain 
  he could inflict upon her. 
Jerry took little note of her question, instead focusing on examining the many 
  implants embedded into her rib cage. 

 &#8220;Why? Why did you do this 
  to me?&#8221; she cried, still demanding an answer.
&#8220;It isn&#8217;t shaved. It&#8217;s 
  been permanently removed, like the rest of your hair. We made it into a wig. 
  You&#8217;ll be wearing it very soon&#8221;, he told her, his voice seemingly 
  disinterested. &#8220;The reason you can&#8217;t speak above a whisper is the 
  feeding tube I installed. It&#8217;s a bit intrusive, but it will ease your 
  daily feeding routine.&#8221;
More tears fell from the girl&#8217;s 
  eyes. &#8220;Answer me! Why are you doing this?&#8221;
&#8220;It&#8217;s what I do&#8221;, 
  he said. &#8220;Sit down, I need to check your feet.&#8221;
&#8220;Please&#8230;please let me 
  go. I won&#8217;t tell anyone. Just please let me go&#8221;, she whimpered, 
  still obeying his commands.
Several minutes passed before Jerry 
  was satisfied with her state. As he completed his task he smiled, secure in 
  the knowledge that his charge&#8217;s implants had not been damaged. 
It was several days later when she 
  next saw Jerry. Like his previous visit he reviewed her body, clinically, looking 
  for any signs that the implants had suffered damage. Satisfied that they were 
  holding up properly he stood, taking her hand.
&#8220;It&#8217;s time&#8221;, he 
  said.
Tears fell from her eyes as she sat 
  staring at the man. She had found the will, for the moment, to resist him. But 
  after writhing on the ground in terrible agony for several minutes, her will 
  was less sturdy. Inevitably, she found herself walking the long walk to meet 
  her fate.
As the door opened to the terrible 
  room, she saw the frame. Again, she found the resolve to fight her tormentor, 
  taking flight. She was felled after running no more than ten paces, whispering 
  her tormented screams. Jerry aided her in regaining her feet, saying nothing. 
  Then, leading her by the arm, Jerry led her to stand in front of her horror.
&#8220;Ready, Bill?&#8221; Jerry 
  asked the man in the white jumpsuit.
&#8220;Bring her here and we&#8217;ll 
  get started&#8221;, the man replied.
Lindsey looked up at Jerry, her eyes 
  pleading. &#8220;Please don&#8217;t&#8230;please.&#8221;
Jerry ignored her, leading her to 
  the man who awaited her. 
A sudden chill shook her body as 
  the other man grasped her arm. She bolted again, determined not to falter, only 
  to be felled by another painful burst of electrical current from the hated collar. 
  So intense was the pain on this occasion that she thought she might die. By 
  the time Jerry relented, she wished she had. 
&#8220;Get up&#8221;, Bill commanded.
Struck by the weight of what was 
  to come, she burst out in tears. She crawled to Jerry&#8217;s feet, grasping 
  his pant leg, begging him for mercy. &#8220;Please, please&#8230;don&#8217;t 
  make me do this&#8221;, she cried. 
&#8220;Up&#8221;, said the other 
  man, grasping her arm and lifting her from the floor. 
She did not fight. She did not attempt 
  to flee. She merely stood on the wide platform and allowed the man to fasten 
  the frame&#8217;s spokes to the row of inserts along her spinal column.
&#8220;Right arm, up and out&#8221;, 
  she heard him say.
Slowly, she lifted her arm. As before, 
  he began attaching the metallic tendrils to the girl. One by one, she watched 
  as the threaded spokes were fastened to her fingers, until she no longer had 
  use of her hand. 
&#8220;Left arm, up and out&#8221;, 
  she heard his voice command. Obediently, she did as commanded, watching his 
  every movement until the fingers of her left hand were firmly secured. 
After checking to make certain that 
  all connections were correct, the man stepped from the platform and ordered, 
  &#8220;Right leg, out.&#8221; 
She stood stock still, tears rolling 
  down her cheeks. &#8220;Please&#8230;please don&#8217;t do this to me&#8221;, 
  the whispered voice pled.
The familiar tingle from the collar 
  returned, prompting her to lift her right leg from the platform and stretch 
  it towards the man. With the proper spoke fixed into the implant set within 
  her heel, her crying became more intense.
&#8220;Left leg, out&#8221;, she 
  heard him say. 
&#8220;Please!&#8221; she blurted 
  through her tears. &#8220;Please, don&#8217;t.&#8221;
&#8220;Left leg, out!&#8221; he demanded, 
  his words in sync with the familiar tingling. 
Slowly then, and with tears running 
  from her eyes, she lifted her leg, allowing the implants to take her full weight, 
  and placed her foot in the man&#8217;s hand. In a moment, she was firmly secured 
  to the frame, with only a few more spokes to attach to her lovely body.
&#8220;Remove the collar, get the 
  cross pieces and her hair on, secure the waste control valve and get her boxed&#8221;, 
  Jerry told the man. &#8220;I want this to slide into place and be hooked up 
  and ready by the weekend.&#8221; 
&#8220;No problem, chief&#8221;, 
  Bill replied.
Jerry turned and strode towards the 
  door. Then, just before exiting the room, he turned to face her. Admiring his 
  creation he smiled. &#8220;You look beautiful, my dear. You will fit in quite 
  well.&#8221; Then he turned and was gone from her sight.
The majority of the anxiety she felt 
  left her after Jerry&#8217;s departure. She had managed to find that place of 
  self-preservation that humans are blessed with. It was a place of solitude and 
  numb acceptance of whatever was to come. Within that temporary state, she was 
  barely aware of the men who applied the finishing touches to the prison in which 
  she now lived. Neither did she take much note when the waste control valve was 
  installed within her posterior opening. 
Finally, upon her being boxed in 
  a large wooden crate, she slept, dreaming of more pleasant times when life was 
  life and horrors like this were unknown to her.

Chapter 6 
The girl woke to find herself in a large and warmly lit room. Across from her, 
  she could see a wall adorned with rich paintings and antique rugs. The floor, 
  what she could see of it, was carpeted as decadently as the walls, in deep reds 
  offset by intricate patterns of various colors. In the far corner to her right 
  stood a statue. It appeared to be made of marble and, despite its vulgar depiction, 
  merged well with the ancient feel of the room. She had seen it before but could 
  not recall where.
As seemed to always be the case, Jerry was there. He was directing the activities 
  of the workers who were installing the frame she inhabited into the wall behind 
  her. The whirring sound of drills brought her more fully awake and she realized 
  that the frame was being fixed to the wall.
&#8220;Alright, bring in the back, secure it and we&#8217;re done&#8221;, said 
  an unseen voice. 
Behind her, she heard the scraping of metal against metal as the men pushed 
  the back piece into place behind her. More whirring of drills could be heard 
  as they fastened the back piece in place. 
&#8220;Bill, check to see that the stimulator is working&#8221;, Jerry called 
  out. A moment ticked by. Suddenly the girl stiffened, her body tensing from 
  the low amperage current flowing through her body.
&#8220;That&#8217;s good. Now set the timer for regular nightly intervals&#8221;, 
  he told the man. &#8220;We don&#8217;t want this piece to whither into atrophy.&#8221;
&#8220;Is it ready?&#8221; asked an unseen voice.
&#8220;Ah, Francis&#8230;yes, it&#8217;s ready&#8221;, Jerry responded. &#8220;Come 
  see what we have wrought.&#8221;
She watched then, as the man who had commissioned her horror came to stand 
  beside Jerry. For many moments they stood, silently admiring the girl. Then 
  her eyes lost focus and she drifted into daydreams, thinking of the things she 
  should and should not have done. She never should have been out alone on that 
  night when Francis had picked her up, nor should she have accepted his offer 
  of a ride. She should have turned him down. She should have been more cautious. 
  Above all, she never should have cooperated with Jerry, no matter how much pain 
  she suffered. It had been a terrible pain, but not so terrible as this. 
&#8220;I deserve this&#8221;, she thought. Then she closed her eyes, praying 
  for the release of sleep.
&#8220;I&#8217;ve one last thing to show you, Francis&#8221;, Jerry said to 
  the man. 
&#8220;What is it?&#8221;
&#8220;We needed an artists rendering of your drawing&#8230;something our engineers 
  could more fully grasp. It seems that our artist got a bit carried away. At 
  any rate, it was so strikingly beautiful that I decided to have it framed for 
  you. I think you&#8217;ll like it&#8221;, he told the man, ripping the paper 
  from the formerly unseen painting.
Within a frame exactly like the one that now decorated Francis&#8217; wall, 
  was a painting of brilliant tones. Set against a midnight background was a mass 
  of three spider webs. Trapped within the strands of web was a girl. She was 
  well shaped and beautiful, her muscles straining to free herself from her predicament. 
  Spread out and clinging to the web holding her fast, were tresses of long auburn 
  hair. Most striking, however, were the girl&#8217;s steely gray eyes. Filled 
  with sad resignation, they held fast, staring into nowhere. 
&#8220;It&#8217;s marvelous!&#8221; Francis whispered.
&#8220;Do you think she would agree?&#8221; Jerry asked the man.
After placing the picture within sight of the girl, Jerry reached out, tickling 
  her right foot. Her eyes opened slowly at the surprised stimulation. 
&#8220;I want you to see something&#8221;, Jerry told her.
She focused on Jerry, arm held out directing her gaze. Following Jerry&#8217;s 
  directing arm, her eyes came to rest upon the painting.. Slowly, the visual 
  of the artists rendering sank in. Staring into the depths of the painting, she 
  gave a brief inward chuckle. &#8220;How horribly and ironically artistic&#8221;, 
  she thought. Then she joined the girl in the painting, staring off into nowhere.
