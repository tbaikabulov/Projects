Chapter 1


Charles Greene and his three mates were loitering around the lower floor of the mall. There were lots pf people in the mall. Kids running around and screaming. Cliques of women pacing around,&nbsp; carrying bags of purchases. Elderly couples eating their ice cream cones.&nbsp; Charles Green&#8217;s mates were also his classmates and their names were Jim, Casper and Norman.&nbsp; 

They had finally finished their secondary school education. They had finally finished school and were now on holiday. Unfortunately they all did badly in their final exams.&nbsp; They failed most of their subjects but then again, most of their classmates failed too. Lucky for their egos, British school students in general tend to flunk most of their exam papers,&nbsp; compared to their continental European counterparts

Right now the boys wanted to have a good time and not think about the future. They had already talked about college and that even students who had university degrees could not find any jobs and so therefore, college would be a waste of time and money. They had also already talked about job applications and what jobs they could possibly do,&nbsp; like somewhere in the near future.

�What day is it?� asked Jim.

�Who cares what day it is? School&#8217;s finally over and summer is here. We finally finished school Jim,� remarked Casper.

It was July,&nbsp; the month in the middle of summer. The sun was not going to come down until ten o clock.&nbsp; It was also very hot where they were and that was Manchester. The four high school students finally finished their secondary school education.&nbsp; . 

�It&#8217;s Thursday Jim!� responded Charles.

�Hey what time is the movie?� asked Norman.

Charles took out his cell phone,&nbsp; then looking at this cell phone. He had a vodafone. 

�I think the film is going to start at seven. Now it&#8217;s half past five,� Charles said.

�Good. That gives us time to get something to eat. I&#8217;m in the mood for Pizza Hut,� Norman spoke in a hungry but excited tone.

�Sounds good to me,� said Casper.

All 4 boys took the escalators leading up to the top floor of the mall. They found the Pizza Hut restaurant and walked there. Once inside, they found themselves a nice table on some corner. The waitress finally came. She was an attractive young pale-skinned lady with curly black hair; round dark eyes, in her early 20s, 5 foot 3 and very thin. 

�Hi my name is Shannon and may I take your order?� the waitress asked in her Irish accent.

The boys ordered a set menu. They had a large party-sized pizza that came with a large bottle of coke, 2 sets of garlic bread, 4 pieces of spicy chicken wings and some white sauces. As for what type of pizza they ordered it was a half-half. Half of it was Barbeque with chicken pieces and mozzarella and the other half was cheese and salami. 

The boys spend an hour eating and chatting at the Pizza Hut restaurant. The cinema was on the same floor as the Pizza Hut restaurant. As for the movie they were going to watch,&nbsp; it was Pirates of the Caribbean 4. It was Charles who had bought all their tickets in advance for them. 

Charles Greene was a good guy to his mates. He did not have many close friends but still hung out with his classmates as they were mates. Charles was about 17 years old; tall at 6 foot 4, well-built, short Blond hair, green eyes which had the same shade as the leaves, complexion as&nbsp; pale as milk and had high cheekbones, like people from Scandinavia and the Baltic.&nbsp; Charles may have looked like a jock but he wasn&#8217;t that dumb. He also wasn&#8217;t too bright either, judging how he failed most of his papers.&nbsp; Despite his height and built, he was also easily intimidated by threats and could easily cave in to pressure.

By 7PM, the boys went into the cinema and sat down on four seats,&nbsp; somewhere on the top row. They had a good view from there. By the time the movie was over, it was already dark outside. The sun was finally gone. The air was still warm. The boys left the mall and waited at the bus stop. When the bus came, they all boarded it and paid for their tickets. As it was a double decker bus, they all went up the spiral case and went upstairs. They found themselves free empty seats at the back of the second floor. They went over there and sat down.

�Man that film was good!� commented Norman.

�I don&#8217;t know about that. I thought the second film was way better!� commented Casper.

�I am waiting for X Men First Class. I am going to catch it when it comes out,� stated Jim.

�Not me,� stated Charles. �I hated the first one and didn&#8217;t bother catching the sequels.�

The boys were going to head to their homes. They all chatted until one of them had to get off. The first person to get among them was Jim. After Jim it was Norman. Then it was Casper. Charles was the last one to be on the bus, until he had to get off. 

Charles got off at a bus stop, that was somewhere on the suburbs of Manchester. His house was two streets away from the bus stop. He walked past the two streets,&nbsp; crossing through pavements and alleyways, until he reached his house. Charles could see lights shimmering behind the curtains of the front window. He knew his mom was home.

Charles pushed the small front gate of his front yard and went towards the front door. He took out his own set of the house-keys and let himself in. 

�Mom I&#8217;m home,� he cried. 

He closed the front door behind him as he was at the front corridor of the house. Charles lived in a one-storey house with his mom. Their house in Manchester had a front yard and his mom&#8217;s car was parked inside the car garage that was at the back of the house. The front corridor led him towards a hallway that was adjacent to the lounge, the kitchen, the bathroom and the two bedrooms. 

Charles went over to the lounge. His mom was standing next to the TV,&nbsp; talking to someone else on her cell phone. His mom saw him and smiled. The TV was running. 

�I am going to the kitchen and make myself a cup of tea. You want one?� he asked her.

�No thanks honey. I have to talk to you about something�.later,� his mom said to him. 

His mom went back to her conversation with her friend on the other side of the cell phone. Charles went over to the kitchen. He took a thermos and filled it up with sink water. He then plugged it towards an empty socket-hole on the counter-table. As the water was boiling, he took an empty cup from the cabinet and placed a tea bag in it. When the thermos water finished boiling,&nbsp; he poured hot water over his cup and took out the tea bag. He then joined his mom on the lounge. His mom was still talking on her cell phone. Charles sat down on the sofa. Right now on TV, he saw videos of armed gunmen firing at a location that looked like the Middle East.

Charles&#8217;s surname was Greene was because it was his dad&#8217;s surname. His parents had divorced about three years ago. It was from his mother where he inherited his complexion, hair and eye colour from. She was much shorter than he was but still pretty attractive. 

Basically this was Charles&#8217;s family history. Both his parents came from a small town called Constantinople&#8217;s Lot. It was a small coastal town that was more or less on the same latitude as The Isle of Man and somewhere between Barrow and Carlisle. The location of that town meant it was somewhere in the north-west of England. As for the name of the town, the person who founded the town was said to have been a Baron who fought in one of the many crusades and named the town after the ancient city that which had been the capital of the Eastern Roman Empire, in what is now Turkey. Despite its name,&nbsp; it bore no resemblance at all to that same city, which is today&#8217;s Istanbul. While the modern city of Istanbul was a striving hot Mediterranean city, which got hotter than 100 Fahrenheit during summer time,&nbsp; Constantinople&#8217;s Lot was usually cold and wet.

As for Charles&#8217;s parents, they got married in Constantinople&#8217;s Lot. Charles was born there and when he was about 10 years old, his parents took him away from that town and started their new lives in the big city of Manchester. This was back in 2004. The United Kingdom was a part of America&#8217;s War on Terror and there was an Islamophobic atmosphere throughout the country.&nbsp; In July 7th of 2005,&nbsp; Muslim terrorists had bombed some bus stops in the middle of London. It further intensified anti-Islamic feelings throughout the British population. At the same time he saw on the news that the south-eastern seaboard of the United States had been devastated by Hurricane Katrina,&nbsp; causing millions of people to be homeless.

His mom finally hung up.

�Charles there are some things I need to tell you,� his mom said.

She had a mixed look of being worried and being excited. 

�Did something happen?� Charles asked in a curious tone.

He gave her a surprised look. 

�Well many things did happen. I have some bad news and I have some other news. The bad news is that I lost my job! I will be laid off in two weeks!� his mom said to him.

Charles did not like the sound of that. If his mom was jobless, she would have to find another job. If his mom couldn&#8217;t find any other job, then it meant that she would have to go on welfare, just to support her and her son.&nbsp; His mom could see now how worried he looked. 

�Hey it&#8217;s not that bad. It only means that as long as we are living here in Manchester, I am going to have to look for some other jobs here!� his mom stated.

�I&#8217;m confused,� Charles was puzzled.

�An old friend of your grandparents passed away. From what dad told me he had no children and in his will, he said that his house were to go to them,� his mom said.

�You mean grandpa and grandma now have a second house. Wait a sec. We are talking about a house in Constantinople&#8217;s Lot, aren&#8217;t we??� Charles asked in a puzzled tone. 

He gave his mom an inquisitive look.&nbsp; He wasn&#8217;t sure if his mom was implying that they were going to move back to their old hometown when she said that she only needed a job in Manchester itself if they were still going to be living in their current house. 

�What is this all about??&nbsp; Are we moving back into Constantinople&#8217;s Lot??� he asked.

�Your grandpa and grandma said that we should return to Constantinople&#8217;s Lot. They said they were going to give this house to us,� his mom said.&nbsp; 

�What??� Charles was shocked.

Charles still had memories of his old life in Constantinople&#8217;s Lot. It was a small quite town where he had friends and the town itself had many beautiful types of scenery. The hills. The beaches. The woods. He was upset when his parents took him away from all his friends and even told them that he vowed to return someday. Then he made new friends in Manchester and forgot about his old ones. 

�They said that this house was a big house and had a nice scenery. They said that it was far bigger and far better than this house. They said that to me that Charles is going to love this place. Maybe when you see it you are going to fall in love with it. Of course it would also mean that we are going to leave Manchester and start over again back there,� his mom said.

�Why don&#8217;t they take the house themselves? Why are they giving it to us?� Charles asked.

�Well because they already have a home and they love it very much. This house they inherited is too big. Grandpa and grandma don&#8217;t like big houses. They said that it would suit you and me more,� his mom said.

�Yeah but if we move in, what are you going to do? What am I going to do? I mean are you going to get a job there?� Charles asked.

�Well I am going to be helping your grandma run her shop. You know that she has a shop that sells things to other people,� his mom said. 

�I didn&#8217;t know that?!� Charles said.

�No of course you don&#8217;t,� his mom sighed.

Both he and his mom knew about how ignorant he could be at times. 

�Wait a minute. You said grandma ran a shop. What does grandpa do? Doesn&#8217;t he help her run the shop?� Charles asked in a curious tone.

�Your granddad is a farmer. The idea is that when I move into their second house, grandma is going to let me run the shop while she helps your grandpa run his farm. Your grandpa is a farmer. I&#8217;m pretty sure I told you that before but as always you keep on forgetting. I blame it on your cellphone. It always distracts you and makes you forget things,� his mom chuckled.

The idea of them having a new home that was much bigger than this one did excite Charles. 

�Look. Let&#8217;s just go there and check it out. I mean if I am going to have a job at your grandma&#8217;s shop, that means I am going to have money coming in,� his mom spoke.

�I guess this means I am going to have to leave all my friends here behind,� he sighed.

�Hey you were upset when we took you away from Constantinople&#8217;s Lot. You were upset that we were taking you away from all your childhood friends. I am doing you a favour here. I am re-uniting you with your old friends,� his mom smiled.

Charles thought about his old friends. He was trying to remember them. Were they still living in that town? Could some of them have even moved out the way he did? 

�You think they are still there??� he asked.

�Of course they are,� his mom was sure.

Charles knew that his mom didn&#8217;t know that for a fact and just speculating. She just wants some excuse to get him to agree to move over there. As for leaving his friends here in Manchester behind was something he could easily do. There was another thing that he couldn&#8217;t live without.

�Mom if we do move in to grandpa&#8217;s new house, would I still have Internet??� he asked.

�Of course you would. Once we get ourselves established there, we can have Internet installed in your new bedroom,� his mom said.

�That would be cool. Mom I was also talking with the other guys about college,� Charles said.

Charles had mixed feelings about whether he should try to go to college or not. A part of him felt like he was not trying hard enough by just simply giving up on something like going to college and making something out of himself. It was more or less an �ego thing�.

�Honey to tell you the truth, I don&#8217;t have that kind of money to send you to college. Do you know how that most college students from this country have to get student loans to go to college and study! When they come out many of them are still jobless and their degrees don&#8217;t help them get jobs. Even if you do get a job, you are going to have to pay back your student loan for the rest of your life and we are talking about you having to pay back at least ten thousand pounds. That is a lot of money. I suggest that if we do decide to live again in Constantinople&#8217;s Lot, you can help me run the shop and I will always give you your allowances,� his mom lectured in a high-pitched defensive emotional tone.

Charles just sighed. 

�I guess,� he sighed in an understanding tone.

He and his mother stared at each other for twenty seconds.

�So when do we go and check it out??� he asked.

�Saturday but we are going to have to wake up very early in the morning. I know that you tend to wake up very late and so I suggest an early night for the both of us tomorrow night,� his mom said.





































Chapter 2


Saturday 


Charles&#8217; mom woke him up at six in the morning. He had to brush his teeth and wash his face inside bathroom in just less than two minutes. By the time he got changed, he went down to the lounge. His mom made him breakfast. Breakfast was tea, fried eggs, toasted bread and hot sausages.&nbsp; They got into the car by 7AM and drove away. They packed some of their clothes in some bags as they were going to spend the next two nights at Charles&#8217;s grandparents&#8217; home. They would be back by Monday evening. Charles had put on his seatbelt. His mom was behind the steering wheel. 

�Aren&#8217;t you just excited hun. We are going to see what our future house looks like,� his mom said.

Charles yawned.&nbsp; This was the first time Charles was going to be visiting his old hometown Constantinople&#8217;s Lot. He had not been there in over seven years. The only time he ever saw his grandparents was when they came down to visit him and his mom. His grandparents had a car and just loved to travel whenever they get the chance. Now he was the one who was going to be seeing them.

�Whatever you say mom. You are the boss,� Charles spoke in a tired tone.

Charles was still feeling pretty tired. 

�Hey just to let you know. I am the one going to be driving the whole day so be grateful,� his mom said.

�I wasn&#8217;t being sarcastic mom,� Charles yawned.

�Well you can just sit there and close your eyes. Just knowing that your grandparents have given us another house excites me. Doesn&#8217;t it excite you too??� his mom asked.

�Mom what if I don&#8217;t like it,� Charles sighed.

�Well I am not going to force down anything on you son. If you are not comfortable living in your old hometown,&nbsp; we will stay here in Manchester. It&#8217;s not hard for me to get another job here. I know that you are not a city person and that you are no longer used to living in some quiet small town. I mean when your dad and I took you out from there, you were hardly a preteen. Hell I am not even sure if I want to run your grandma&#8217;s shop. I too have gotten used to city life. All I can say is that we can only give it a try. If we are both ok with the house and starting our new lives there, we can stay there. If we find it dreadful, we&#8217;d just get out. Do you like my plan?� his mom asked in a warm loving tone.

�Yeah mom. That sounds cool,� Charles nodded in agreement.

His mom was still sat down there,&nbsp; starting to ignite the car key.&nbsp; The car engine started roaring. 

�Mom if we do go back there to live again, you can install Internet in my bedroom right??� he asked her.

He already asked her this question just on Thursday night. His mom said �yes� but he wanted to be sure that she meant it.

�Honey didn&#8217;t I say you can,� his mom was a bit annoyed.

�Thanks mom,� Charles smiled.

His mom shook his head. Her hand moved the pedal and her foot hit the break. She started driving. As the car was moving out of the garage,&nbsp; she slowed down. She opened the driver&#8217;s door and got out. She went over to the back garage where the car had been parked and closed it down. She came back into the car and put her seatbelt on. 

�Tell me something honey. Do you remember any of your old friends?� his mom asked.

She gave him a curious look.

�Honestly, no. I don&#8217;t remember any of my old friends,� Charles replied. 

�Not to worry. When you see them and they see you, your memories will come flooding back to the good old days when you were all kids,� his mom cheered.

His mom started driving away,&nbsp; towards the main street. 

Charles&#8217;s mom had been driving for hours. Their destination was northwards, as they were driving from Manchester. They stopped once to get something to eat. Charles and his mom ate at a large Subway outlet off some highway.&nbsp; After Subway they continued their journey towards Constantinople&#8217;s Lot. It was then that Charles started dozing off. He closed his eyelids and his mind wandered off to dreamland.

Charles was having a very strange dream. He was dreaming about being a young kid again. He was with a group of other kids and they were running around in what looked like a small town.&nbsp; There were lots of trees everywhere. Charles was leading this group of kids. As for why they were running around was simple. They were chasing another kid. In fact they were chasing and taunting a young girl. She was about their age. She was running away from them. She had black clothes. Her hair was messy and uncombed. She looked and behaved as if she was some young gypsy child, being cruelly harassed by the towns&#8217; children. 

�Leave me alone,� the young girl cried. 

She had dark mousy brown hair and looked scared. Charles and the other kids were calling her names.

�Witch. Witch. Witch,�&nbsp; they taunted her cruelly and unmercifully.

She was running towards the woods. Charles and the other kids were continuing to chase after her. Charles was glad that he was making her feel miserable. They kept on chasing after her until she fell down to the ground. Two of the other kids with Charles came and picked her up. Each kid grabbed an arm. 

�You know what happens to bad little witches,� Charles taunted her.

The poor girl shook her head. She had fear in her eyes. 

�Please don&#8217;t hurt me,� she begged.

She pleaded.

Before Charles could continue dreaming, he heard his mom&#8217;s voice.

�Honey wake up,� his mom called out.

Charles slowly flickered his eyes. He found himself back in his mom&#8217;s car.

�We&#8217;re here,� his mom said.

Charles started looking out the window. He saw small houses off the side of the street. He saw lots of fields. Some with buildings. Some open. As his mom kept on driving, Charles got a more better view of where they were. His mom&#8217;s car even made a turn towards a road where he could make out some beaches. Charles saw the waves hitting against the sands. 

�Mom what time is it?� he asked her.

He forgot that his mom&#8217;s car had a timer screen. He saw the time. It was somewhere after 3 o&#8217; clock. 

�Nice view isn&#8217;t it. The good thing about living here is that we can go to the beach anytime we want,� his mom commented.

Charles had mixed feelings. He was born in this town and hadn&#8217;t stepped foot in it in seven years. He was in Constantinople&#8217;s Lot. He was back in the town he was born in. A part of his brain had a sense of belonging and it was telling him (more like Charles telling himself in his head) one thing.

Welcome home Charles. 











































Chapter 3


Charles and his mom went over to Charles&#8217;s grandparents&#8217; home. His mom parked her car next to another car on the driveway of his grandparents&#8217; house. His mom got out of the car and knocked on the front door. A minute later his grandma opened the front door and exchanged hugs with his mom.&nbsp; Charles and his mom took out their bags and then went inside the house.

Charles&#8217;s grandparents lived in a two-storey house. The house was even much bigger than their house in Manchester. It was a house that stood by itself on top of some small green hill. There were trees on either side of the house and even some behind it. Once inside Charles could make out what the house was like. On the lower floor were the lounge, a large kitchen with a dining table in it and a large bathroom. On the upper floor were two bedrooms, another bathroom and a study room. One of the bedrooms upstairs was occupied by both his grandparents. 

His granddad took them all on a sightseeing of the town in his car. His mom sat next to his granddad while he and his grandma sat behind. Charles could make out houses. Some big, like his grandparents and some smaller than even his car garage back in Manchester. He saw shops. He saw pubs. He even saw a church. He saw other buildings, including his old school. 

Finally his grandparents drove to the house they inherited from a close friend of theirs. It was the house his grandparents were going to give to him and his mom.&nbsp; It was a two-storey house that was even far bigger than his grandparents&#8217;.&nbsp; It was off the side of the road.&nbsp; It faced some woods and not far from it, was a cliff. 

�Awesome!!�&nbsp; Charles commented when he saw it. 

The moment he saw the house he wanted to know what inside of it was like. This was a house he wouldn&#8217;t mind living in,&nbsp; just by judging from its outward appearance. 

His grandfather had the key to the house. When they got out of his granddad&#8217;s car, his granddad led them to the front door. He opened it with that house&#8217;s set of keys. Once the front door was opened, his granddad ushered for all of them to walk through.&nbsp; Charles was having an inside tour of the house. 

Charles&#8217;s granddad took them on a tour of the lower floor. . It had many hallways and corridors. It had a very large lounge,&nbsp; with sofas and even a piano.&nbsp; It had a very large kitchen,&nbsp; with cutleries hanging down. It had its own dining hall. It had a very large bathroom, like ones normally found in hotels. It also had another room that was large and full of book shelves with books packed on them. It also had a study table too. Charles thought it was some kind of library.&nbsp;&nbsp; Charles&#8217;s granddad then took them up the stairs leading to the upper floor. On the upper floor was another bathroom. There were also four bedrooms. Apparently the previous owner of the house often had guests for sleepovers and so enough bedrooms. It was when they inspected the upstairs bedrooms that Charles made a comment to his grandma.

�He must have been very wealthy!� commented Charles.

�Oh yes he was. The thing was that he was born in this town but made his fortune in the cities. He paid a fortune to have this house built. He finally decided to come and settle down back in this town as he got tired of the city life. He had many friends apart from your granddad but many of them passed away before he did and he had no children or grandchildren of his own. He had no close relatives whatsoever. Well if you are going to ask me if whether he left your grandpa or me any money, the answer is no. Half of it went to some charities and some organizations and the other half went to the town council so that they could use that money to help build up this town. The only thing he gave us was just this house and everything in it. He was a kind man Charles. Too bad you never got to meet him,� his grandma commented. 

The last thing they saw on the upper floor was the attic. There was nothing there. 

After having a tour of the insides of the house, Charles&#8217;s granddad took them outside. On the side of the house was the basement door which led them to the basement. What was attached to the outer exterior of the house was a storage room,&nbsp; where the house&#8217;s power generator was located. 

�Hey mom this place is awesome!!� Charles cheered excitedly.

�Told you that you should come and stay here. I think you should run the shop. Business is good and this town is far more peaceful than the big city. You don&#8217;t even have to worry about locking your door at night,� commented Charles&#8217;s granddad.

�You even have a cliff nearby where you can get a good view of the sea. I mean this is your home Sara. You were born in this town. You should be living here. Your father and I won&#8217;t be far away from you and Charles anymore,� Charles&#8217;s grandma remarked.

&#8216;Sara&#8217; was Charles&#8217;s mother&#8217;s first name. When she divorced Charles&#8217;s dad, she once more used her original surname, which was Lockwood. Charles still retained his father&#8217;s surname, as he often kept contact with his dad. 

Living in that new house would mean that Charles and his mom would be living much closer to his grandparents. Sara first looked at her son and then at her mom and dad. She then finally looked at Charles. She then turned to gaze at all of them.

�So Charles what do you think of your new home?� his granddad asked him.

�Love it. Can we move in mom? Can we?� Charles asking his mom like a little kid begging for an ice cream cone. 
Sara sighed in happy defeat.

�Alright. We&#8217;ll take it. Charles and I would move in,� Sara cried.

�Yes!!� Charles screamed in excitement, making facial and bodily gestures with his face and right arm.&nbsp; �Can&#8217;t wait to tell dad where we just moved.�

His mom and his grandparents looked at each other. They had dtrange looks on their faces. 

�No hun. I&#8217;ll tell him. I will tell your dad that we are no longer going to be in Manchester and he will know where to come to look for you,� Sara telling Charles.

�I know we are just going to love this place!!�&nbsp; Charles commented.

Charles stared at his new home. 

�But we are going to be moving in only in two weeks. That is when I finish my contract with my boss,� Sara telling both her parents/ Charles&#8217; grandparents. 

As for Charles, all he could think about was moving into their new house. 



























Chapter 4


Two Weeks Later



Charles was moving his head left and right. He woke up. He found himself back in his bed. It was dark everywhere but his leaf-coloured green eyes slowly adjusted to the darkness. He looked towards the direction of his window. He could now make out the moonlight shining through his window curtain. 

He had been having those same dreams again. The first dream was the one he first had in his mom&#8217;s car town two weeks ago. He was ten years old. He was leading a group of other kids. They were always chasing and bullying some poor young girl. She looked like some kind of gypsy. She was terrified of Charles and the other kids. 

The second dream was about him and the kids throwing stuff outside that poor girl&#8217;s house. The third dream was the worst. He and the other kids carried that poor girl. She was kicking and screaming at them but they were too strong for here. They threw her body down the river, as the water stream was moving.&nbsp; She was crying out to them for help but all they did was laughed at her.&nbsp; They would then mock her in their cruel tones. 

�Drown witch. Drown witch,� Charles and the other kids would mock her. 

Charles never told anyone about his dreams but he thought that they must have been memories of his childhood life in Constantinople&#8217;s Lot. The strange thing was that he never really remembered the things he did in this town or what kind of person he had been. As far as the dreams were concerned, he was some kind of bully and Charles asked himself if it had all been true. Charles felt guilty for even dreaming that he would behave in such a way. 

This was Charles&#8217;s second night in his new house. Yesterday he and his mom were busy unpacking and settling down, with the help of their grandparents of course. Today he accompanied his mom to the new shop she was going to be running. They also went to a shop and bought Charles a new bicycle so that he could travel around town. As for the house itself, Charles loved it. He had a large bedroom, which was as big as a master bedroom. His bed was big enough for three persons. It wasn&#8217;t jus his bedroom. All the bedrooms in this house were large. 

Charles got up from his bed. He walked over to the window and pulled the curtains. From his window he could see the cliff. He asked himself three questions: Who was that girl in his dreams? Is she still alive and still living in this town? If they ever bumped into each other, what would happen?

The next day Charles was riding around town in his bicycle. He cycled over the hills. He cycled past beaches. He cycled past shops. He even saw a small cinema but that meant nothing to him. He didn&#8217;t have the Internet in his home yet but once he did, he was going to download all the latest movies for free. 

His mom was running his grandma&#8217;s shop and she gave him some pocket money before she left. She told him to go out and have his own tour of the town. She gave him some money so that he could go out and get something to eat. Charles saw a diner off a street. It was one-storey and had a sign outside it that said CRUSADERS. There were some bike-racks, already filled up with bikes. Charles tied his bike to a rack and then went inside the diner.

The diner had two rows of chairs and tables. Each row was towards the wall and opposite each other.&nbsp; At the back of the diner was the counter. Two tables to his right were already occupied. One table was occupied by two elderly ladies. The other table occupied by four youths. They looked like his age and were not familiar to him. Charles couldn&#8217;t remember the people of this town at all. He walked all the way to the counter. There was a lady behind the counter. She was in her 30s; thin, had brown-green eyes, high cheekbones, auburn-coloured hair and a friendly smile. 

�I haven&#8217;t seen you here before. Are you new in this town?� she asked him.

The lady kept on smiling at him.

�Well yes and no!� he responded.

�What do you mean??� she was puzzled.

�Never mind. Can you just give me a cheeseburger and a coke� he said.

�Coming right up!� she responded in a frustrated tone.

She walked away, yelling to the kitchen staff and then went back to him.

�Will that be all?� she asked him in a rude tone. 

Charles knew why she was irritated but right now all he could think about was his stomach.

�Yeah,� he responded.

She told him how much it cost and he paid the money. Five minutes later the lady came back with his order. She handed him a tray with can of coke and a large cheeseburger. And some French fries too.

�How come I get fries??� he asked.

There were cafes and diners in cities that served menus where a customer could order a cheeseburger with a drink and fries. He didn&#8217;t know if that was the case in small towns too. He didn&#8217;t order it but they gave it to him. 

�I think in the big cities where you come from, they call them set menus. Now enjoy your meal sir and have a nice day,� the woman giving him a fake smile.

He took the food tray and walked away. He sat down and ate on an empty table. He caught the four youths from the other side looking at him. He chose to ignore them and continue eating.&nbsp; When he finished eating, he walked out of the diner. He walked over to the bike rack and took out his bike. It was then that he saw the four youths coming out from the diner. They were looking at him. Menacingly. 

�Hi guys. Can I help with you something?!� Charles spoke. 

Three of them were shorter than him. One guy stood at 6 foot 5; had medium brown hair and blue-grey eyes. That guy glared at him and spoke to him in a threatening tone.

�What are you doing in our town? We don&#8217;t like nosy strangers coming here. We hate troublemakers,� that tall guy snarled.

The other three guys looked just as menacingly as the taller guy. 

�Hey look. I don&#8217;t want any trouble. I just moved back here,� Charles responded as diplomatically as he could.

One of the other three guys started opening his mouth. He had jet black hair, pale complexion and blue eyes. 

�You&#8217;re not from this town. You&#8217;re a liar. We&#8217;ve never seen your face here before,� the pale black-haired guy taunted Charles.

�Well you guys don&#8217;t look familiar to me too,� Charles spoke back.

�What!� the taller guy showing his annoyance at Charles&#8217;s defiance.

Charles thought these guys were the local town bullies and picking on him as he was the new guy. 

�Why don&#8217;t you guys go pick on somebody else� Charles taunted back.

He quickly got on his bike.

�Hey why don&#8217;t you come here and say that to our faces,� the taller guy spoke.

�Yeah. Yeah. Just shut up before we go over there and beat you up!� threatened a third boy. 

Charles just started cycling away. It was his third day in Constantinople&#8217;s Lot and he was already making enemies. Now he knew what the girl in his drams felt like when he was chasing her. The last thing Charles heard from one of the four boys was, �Quick!! After him!!�

Charles was cycling in the road,&nbsp; leading up to a highway surrounded by woods on either side. As Charles kept on cycling, he could hear the other boys cycling after him. They were making threatening noises against him. He wanted to get away from them as far as possible. They were four and he was just one. Charles cycled as fast as he could. He felt the winds blowing against his face. 

As Charles kept on cycling, he then made a turn towards the woods. He was planning on losing them there. He cycled past a couple of trees and bushes. If he stopped he was sure that those four kids were going to come and beat him up.&nbsp; He cycled until his bicycle hit against some large stone. He fell off his bike and his bike hit the ground. 

�Shit� he told himself.

Just as he was about to get up, the four boys on their bicycles were gaining on him. The taller guy quickly got off his bike and with one kick towards Charles&#8217;s face, he sent Charles back to the ground. 

�You should have never messed with us,� the taller boy told Charles.

With one punch, Charles blanked out. He lost consciousness and there was blackness around him.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *********


�Hey wake up!� Charles heard someone calling to him.

With one tight slap towards his face,&nbsp; he woke up. Charles found himself pinned against some large human-sized rock. His back was arched backwards and his head towards the top of the rock. Two guys were pinning him down.&nbsp; The taller guy and the black-haired guy were glaring at him. 

�You shouldn&#8217;t have run away from us,� the taller guy said to Charles.

The other two guys who were pinning Charles down weren&#8217;t laughing. They were both serious. 

�We don&#8217;t like outsiders and troublemakers coming to our nice little town and starting trouble,� taunted the black-haired guy.

�Hey I&#8217;m not really a stranger! I told you the truth. I was born here and my parents took me away when I was a little kid,� Charles confessed.

He confessed but knew that either the boys didn&#8217;t believe him or chose not to believe him. 

�We hate liars. We know what we do to liars in this town,� taunted the black-haired boy. 

He took out his flick knife. Charles gulped. 

Oh my God, they&#8217;re going to kill me, Charles panicked in his head.

�Look man. Don&#8217;t do this. I got money. How much do you want?� Charles started chickening out. 

�Hey why don&#8217;t you guys leave him alone,� called out a girl&#8217;s voice. 

�Oh shit!� the taller boy gulped. 
























Chapter 5




The four boys turned to look behind them and then they started running away. 

�This isn&#8217;t over yet!� the taller boy told Charles. 

The four boys disappeared from view. Charles realized that he was somewhere up on some hills, not far from the woods where he had just been knocked unconscious. 

Charles saw three young girls, roughly about his age. 

�Hey are you alright? Don&#8217;t let them get to you,� one of the girls said to him.

As she came and approached him, she put a hand on his forehead. 

�Your nose is bleeding. Here let me help you!� that girl said to him.

She took out a handkerchief and used it to wipe the blood from his nose.

�Thanks but I could have taken on them,� Charles joked.

�Yeah right,� the girl joked back.

Charles now had a much better view of the girl, his heart was beating. 

I&#8217;ve been saved by an angel, Charles thought.

The girl wore a black leather jacket and leather hot pants. She stood at 5 foot 9; had pale complexion, crystal blue eyes, long brown hair and very attractive. Charles caught a glimpse of the other two girls. From the looks of it, they reminded him of girl-gangs in Manchester and London.&nbsp; But this tough girl was not menacing him at all. Instead she was taking good care of his bruises. 

�Thank you,� Charles was grateful.

Charles knew that he was in love. As the Brunette who had just taken care of him kept on smiling, he knew he wouldn&#8217;t be able to stop staring back. 

�You&#8217;re new in Constantinople&#8217;s Lot, aren&#8217;t you?� the Brunette asked him.

Charles thought better not to annoy her too by giving her a �yes and no� response. 

�Yeah I am. I&#8217;m Charles by the way,� Charles offering his hand for a shake.

�My name&#8217;s Ivy,� Ivy shaking Charles&#8217;s hand.&nbsp; �And these are my friends.�

Ivy turned around and stared at the other two girls. One of the other girls resembled Ivy a bit but she had curlier hair and it was tied back in a bun. The other girl was a redhead with shirt cropped hair. 

�That&#8217;s Katherine..� pointing at the other girl who resembled and then at the redhead, �....and that&#8217;s Megan.�

Katherine and Megan smiled at him. 

�Wow. Those guys were scared of you,� Charles complimenting Ivy.

�You shouldn&#8217;t be afraid of them. They&#8217;re just bullies. Come. Let me help you up. Hey we saw a bike down there. I take it that is yours,� Ivy said.

Ivy helped Charles get up and out an arm behind his back. 

�Charles don&#8217;t get scared if I say this to you but you&#8217;re kinda cute,� Ivy flirting with him.

�Why thank you. You&#8217;re not bad yourself,� Charles complimenting her back.

The 3 girls helped Charles climb down the hill and walked all the way to where his bike laid. He then followed the three girls to where they parked their bikes. They all got into their bikes and started cycling away. 

Charles spent the whole day with Ivy and the girls. The girls took him to a lovely beach where they all sat down and watched the waves roar.&nbsp; That same night he text his mom,&nbsp; saying that he would be home by 10PM as he was going to hang out with his new friends at a pub.

Inside the pub was loud music playing. There were many men and women there, chatting and drinking and smoking. The pub also had a pool table. Charles and the three girls played pool. Charles had such a good time with all of them. 

By the time it was 10PM,&nbsp; Ivy went over to Charles on the other side of the table.

�Hey Charles listen. It was fun hanging out with you today. You&#8217;re a real good guy,� Ivy complimented him.

�Yeah you too,� Charles smiling back at her.

Charles did not want this night to be over. A part of him already wanted to hug her. To kiss her. He was even hoping that they would also have sex too. 

�Me and the girls are going to go now,� Ivy said.

The other two girls Megan and Katherine were sat down on a table, drinking and smoking. They chatted between themselves and then taking glimpse at Ivy and Charles.

�Hey wait. Are you going home now?� he asked.

�Yes I am,� she responded.

�If you want, I could walk you all home. It&#8217;s not a problem,� Charles offered.

Charles wanted to know where Ivy lived. 

�No Charles. Tell you what. We exchange cell phone numbers so we can be in touch. I think right now we girls got to have our own personal moments. I am sure that you guys do that too,� Ivy said.

Ivy smiled at him very lovingly. Charles and Ivy exchanged cell phone numbers. Charles took it that she didn&#8217;t want him to follow her home�yet.

�Charles I&#8217;m glad that you are going to be joining our little town. My advice is to stay away from most of the guys here. In fact I think you should stick with us three girls. We enjoy your company. I enjoy your company,� Ivy told him.

Ivy walked over to the other two girls and they all got up. They waved at him.

�See you Charles. Remember to call me!� Ivy said.

Charles left the pub 5 minutes after the three girls left. He cycled all the way home. When he got home, his mom was in the lounge.

�Is that you hun!� his mom called out.

�Yeah it&#8217;s me mom,� Charles responded.

�Hun come to the lounge!� his mom called out to him.

Charles joined his mom in the lounge. 

�So you are making new friends. I&#8217;m glad to hear that. Tell me what are their names?� Sara asked Charles in a happy tone.

Charles told his mom their names. His mom didn&#8217;t know who these girls were but just happy that his son was making friends. His mom made him hot tea and she said that she wanted him to help her run the shop every day, either in the morning or the afternoon. Everyday except Sunday as the town was partially conservative and that it would be a slap to the town&#8217;s face if she ran it on a Sunday.

That night Charles could not sleep. All he could think about was Ivy. He thought about Ivy while lying down on his bed. He wanted her to be his girlfriend. He couldn&#8217;t sleep properly that night and only managed an hour&#8217;s sleep. 

The next day he followed his mom to her shop and helped her run it,&nbsp; selling items to customers who came in. Even that day all he could think about was Ivy. His mom would close the shop by 6PM.&nbsp; Somewhere around 3PM, Charles text Ivy&#8217;s cell phone number. His mom was working on one of the shelves and he was just behind the counter. 

�Hey Ivy wanna meet up?� Charles text her. 

It was only after 40 minutes that he got a response from Ivy. He looked at his cell phone. He had 1 message. He clicked on it. It was from Ivy. He opened it up. The message&nbsp; said �8PM outside the same pub yesterday.�&nbsp; Charles smiled. 

Charles told his mom that he was going to meet up with Ivy and she said that it was ok. Charles cycled to the same pub he went with Ivy last night and met her by the front entrance. She was with the other girls Katherine and Megan. 

�Hi,� Charles said to them.

�Hi Charles,� Megan smiled at him.

�Listen Charles. We are going somewhere else tonight. Since you are new here, we thought of taking you to see something else. There is a beach near some cliff. Have you been there?� she asked him.

Charles thought about it. He couldn&#8217;t remember if he ever spotted a beach near some cliff. He shook his head.

�Ok. Let&#8217;s go there then,� Ivy said.













Chapter 6



It was an empty beach with a large cliff towering over it. Looming over it.&nbsp; Even thought it was somewhere after seven in the evening, the sun was still shining brightly but it wasn&#8217;t that warm anymore. Four bikes were resting on the beach ground.&nbsp; Charles and Ivy were walking around the beach,&nbsp; with Megan and Katherine following behind them. 

�So Charles you never been here before?� she asked him.

�No. I am just surprised that I missed this place,� Charles remarked.

�Well if you lived here long enough as I have,&nbsp; you would have also known about this spot,� Ivy smiled at him.

Ivy looked so beautiful when she smiled. She was being warm towards Charles.&nbsp; Charles just wanted to continue talking to her.

�So you come here often?� he asked her. 

�Sometimes by myself,� Ivy said. �When I want to be alone.�

Charles liked what he just heard. He wished he was just alone here with Ivy,&nbsp; hiolding hands like boyfriend-and-girlfriend and that they would start smooching. 

Ivy looked at Charles for a while.

�So you came here with your parents?� she asked him.

�Just with my mom. My parents are divorced,� Charles sighed.

He hated the fact that his parents had been divorced.

�That&#8217;s really terrible.&nbsp; I can understand the feeling,� Ivy sounding sad and understanding.

�I sometimes wished they got back together again but they both have their own lives and I can practically do what I want,� Charles trying not to sound sad.

�So what made you come here to Constantinople&#8217;s Lot?� she asked him.

This was the question Charles wasn&#8217;t sure how to respond to. Even now he knew how attracted he was to Ivy and if she had lived in this town for years, then he would have known her since childhood too. The problem was he didn&#8217;t recognize Ivy at any time before yesterday. 

�Well it was my mom&#8217;s decision. She just like small towns. More peaceful and more safer than the big cities,� Charles making up his own answer.

�So you&#8217;re from one of the big cities. Cool,� Ivy smiled with excitement.

�Yes I am. I&#8217;m from Manchester,� Charles said. 

�I have never been to the big cities. I mean I have learned and read about them on the news and the internet but never been there,� Ivy confessed.

�Have you ever been out of Constantinople&#8217;s Lot?� Charles was curious.

�I am embarrassed to say this but no,� Ivy chuckled.

Charles chuckled too. Then they both started laughing. 

�Charles I would love to visit cities like London or Bristol or Liverpool. Or Birmingham,� Ivy confessed.

�You do?� he pretended to sincerely ask her.

He was sure that most townspeople always dreamt of visiting a big city, at least once in their lifetime. 

�Of course. I want to experience city life. So Charles I&#8217;ll make you a deal. You tell me more about where you lived and I will tell you more about Constantinople&#8217;s Lot,� Ivy suggested.

�Ok,� Charles said.

Ivy smiled at him.&nbsp; Charles smiled back. Both their cheeks turned red. Charles was sure that she liked him too. 













Chapter 7




For the last 2 weeks Charles had been hanging out with Ivy and her friends. They had been hanging out nearly every night. Every time he was going to meet up with her (and her friends),&nbsp; he was always excited. In the mornings and afternoons, he worked at his mom&#8217;s shop. He got to know more about the townspeople as many of them were customers who came to the shop. Some were adults. Some were young kids. Some were kids his age. Some of the teenagers would talk to him as he was the new guy and he told them that he was born in Constantinople&#8217;s Lot and told them his surname. 

The teenagers didn&#8217;t recognize his surname as it was his father&#8217;s surname but they knew his mother&#8217;s surname as her grandparents were still around and living in Constantinople&#8217;s Lot.&nbsp; Charles&#8217;s grandparents from his father&#8217;s side of the family died a long time ago and his dad had been raised by his grandaunt. 

Some of the customers were his mom&#8217;s old friends who came all the way to the shop just to welcome his mom back. As for how they knew she was back, was simple. Most of the townspeople attended church on Sundays. His grandparents attended church on Sundays. They told their friends in church and word spread. Also that once his mom lived in Constantinople&#8217;s Lot, she had to register with the town council so that they knew who lived in their town and word spread from there too. 

By the time it was 6PM, Sara approached Charles while he was working on one of the shelves. 

�Honey I know you hang out with your new girlfriend every night but this coming Saturday I want you home the whole day,� Sara telling him.

�Well she thinks we are just friends but why do you need me to be home all day on Saturday??� he asked her.

�Your grandparents and I are going to throw a party. At our house. It is our way of telling the town that we are here to stay. I&#8217;m sure your girlfriend will understand,� Sara smiling at her son.

�I know she will. So we are going to have a party huh,� Charles said.

�Yes. Hey does she know where we live?� his mom asked. 

�Well we never walked each other home. She&#8217;s kinda picky about that,� Charles said.

�Does she know that you like her?� his mom asked.

�I never told her. I have been meaning to but�� Charles sounding embarrassed.

��too shy or too scared. I know the feeling son. Hey just tell her where you live and that your mom is throwing a party. The she can get to know the real you. Oh by the way. I invited the parents of some of the kids from the school here. Did you know that some of your old friends are still here. I am surprised that you never bumped into any of them. But that won&#8217;t matter. You are going to be seeing your old friends this Saturday. The kids you grew up with. Isn&#8217;t that great!!� his mom cried with excitement.

I am going to be seeing my old childhood friends. Now this is going to be exciting, Charles telling himself in his head.




































Chapter 8



Saturday &#8211; Day of the Party



Charles&#8217;s house was crowded with people. There were people standing and chatting amongst themselves on the hallways. The dining table was full of food and drinks; cutleries, plates and plastic cups.&nbsp; There were adults. There were elderly like Charlie&#8217;s grandparents. There were young children running around and screaming. 

Everyone was having a good time. Except Charlie. He was sat down on one of the chairs,&nbsp; drinking his punch drink. He told Ivy about the party and she told him that she would get back to him on that. In the end she said that something came up and that she couldn&#8217;t come to his house. 

As Charles was sat down drinking,&nbsp; he saw his mother approaching him. There were some women and guys his age coming towards his direction.&nbsp; Charles was now thinking if these were his childhood friends. His mom introduced him to some of the other male teenagers and they told him that they all used to play with him when they were little kids. They were in their 16s and 17s. They remembered him but he didn&#8217;t remember them. 

His mom told the other boys to introduce him to the other teenage boys that were in the house. His mom and these boys&#8217; mothers then left them to their own devices. The boy who was the most friendliest to Charles was a boy named John. He was a head shorter than Charles and kind of looked like the Hollywood actor Richard Gere. 

John led Charles all over his own house,&nbsp; introducing to the other teenage boys and girls. They were very shocked to learn that this Charles who was now living in this house, was the same Charles whom played with them when they were little kids. They told him that he looked different since he was 10. Overall they were glad that he was back. It had been 7 years since they last saw him.

Finally John led Charles all the way to one of his own house&#8217;s corridor where four teenage boys were stood up and drinking. Charles recognized them. And they recognized Charles too.&nbsp; These were the four boys who messed around with him, outside the diner and in the woods.

�Guys I want you to meet your fearless leader. This is Charles Greene. Charles these were your closest buddies. They would follow you anywhere,� John introducing them. 

The guy who was the ringleader of this group, the one who was taller than Charles look astonished. So did the guy with black hair. 

�Is that you Charles? My God we did not recognize you at all mate,� the taller guy was breathing slowly.

He obviously looked and felt embarrassed. 

�Hey listen mate. Sorry about last time. We didn&#8217;t know it was you,� the black haired guy made an apology.

�I take it that you already bumped into each other,� John smiling and moving his eyebrows.

�Under the wrong circumstances,� Charles made a weak chuckle. 

�Hey John, we want to have some private moments with our old friend Charles here,� the taller guy said to John.

�Sure no problem,� John understood. 

�Hey Charles could we talk outside?� asked the taller guy.

�Yeah sure,� Charles nodded.

Charles and the four guys walked past through crowds of people, from that hallway up to the front door. They went outside the house. The front door was opened as they were having a house party. Charles followed the four guys to a side of the house.

�Hey Charles it&#8217;s good to see you again,� the taller guy said.

Before Charles could blink, the taller guy went over to him and gave him a bear hug. 

�It&#8217;s your buddy Brady. Don&#8217;t you recognize me? We used to have good times together,� Brady said.

Brady let go of him.

�Before you left town, you vowed to return. You did come back to us Charles. Welcome home,� the black haired guy smiled.

�Charles don&#8217;t you remember us?� asked Brady.

�As a matter of fact Brady, no. I don&#8217;t remember my childhood in this town at all,� Charles confessed to them.

�You don&#8217;t remember us? You don&#8217;t remember any of your childhood?� the black haired guy was shocked.&nbsp; �Well that makes sense. If you did you would have recognized us too.&nbsp; I mean back at the diner three weeks ago.�

�Charles this is your good buddy Pete,� Brady introducing the black haired guy to him.

Pete and Charles shook hands. Charles then looked at the two other guys and he now had a much better view of them. One guy was plump with a round face; brown hair and brown eyes. The fourth guy was a skinny Blond.

�This is Thomas,� Brady introducing the plump guy,&nbsp; then turning towards the skinny Blond guy, �and Alex.�

�I guess you didn&#8217;t want to remember your childhood. I don&#8217;t think any of us are going to blame you for that,� Thomas spoke in a serious tone.

�What do you mean? You mean my mind blocked out my memories??� Charles asked.

�It&#8217;s guilt. Whenever my uncle did something bad and felt bad about it, he too wouldn&#8217;t remember having done any of it,� commented Alex. 

Charles was shocked. He remembered the dreams he had been having. He remembered that dream where he and those kids threw that poor girl down the river. Did he kill someone? Charles now had more questions in his head. 

�Charles that day when we brought you up that hill, there were some girls. We left when they came. Did you chat with them? Did you stay behind?� asked Pete.

�Well I sometimes hang out with them!� Charles responded.

All of a sudden all four guys laughed. They laughed at near-hysterical level.

�Guys what the fuck is going on here? Is there something you&#8217;re not telling me??� Charles barked.

�You obviously don&#8217;t remember her and she obviously did not recognize you. Seven years later you two become such good pals, perhaps even going out on dates,� commented Thomas.

�Will someone tell me what the hell is going on here???� Charles asked in a frustrated tone.

He hated being kept in the dark. 

�Charles where is your dad?� asked Pete.

Pete looked serious. Brady, Thomas and Alex also looked serious. 

�He and my mum got divorced. It&#8217;s just the two of us now,� Charles replied. �Now please tell me what is going on here.�

�Charles you used to be our gang leader. The four of us and even some of the other kids sued to follow you around. You were the tough kid in the neighbourhood. That girl you are hanging out with, Ivy, is one of the reasons why your dad took you away from this town,� Brady commented.

Charles then realized who the girl of his dreams was. It was Ivy. 

�Mate you made us throw her down the river. It was the biggest story of this town,� Alex chuckled.

�Charles I know that you probably remember none of what happened many years ago but we still do. It&#8217;s still fresh in our memories. I think I should start from the beginning,� Brady sighed.




























Chapter 9



Brady&#8217;s Story



They were still 10 years of age.&nbsp; They were just kids. Charles was the most outspoken and assertive kind in his class.&nbsp; The teachers loved him. The girls fell in love with him. Some of the boys looked up to him. Some of the boys were a part of his clique. Those boys were Brady, Pete, Alex and Thomas.&nbsp; They were the coolest kids of the primary education grade. 

Charles and his gang often hang out by the diners, the woods, the hills, the cliffs and even the beaches.&nbsp; But there was one particular beach where they never hang out on. It was a beach that was close to a cliff that stood beside it and towered over it.&nbsp;&nbsp; From the beach,&nbsp; people could walk all the way up to the hilly woods,&nbsp; until they finally reached the same height as the cliffs. 

As the story goes, those parts were supposedly haunted. Charles and his gang had cycled all the way to that same beach next to that cliff but dared not cycle all the way up the hills. All they knew, or rather heard from rumours, was that that hill was full of all kinds of supernatural evil. 

It was one day in September when Charles and his gang went to Graham,&nbsp; who was a shopkeeper. Graham sold all kinds of things,&nbsp; including magazines. The boys would sometimes buy comic book magazines.&nbsp; Sometimes they bought local British ones like 2000AD but they preferred the American ones like Marvel Comics&#8217; The Ultimates or DC&#8217;s Superman/Batman series. Charles and Brady brought up the subject about that beach next to that cliff and asked Graham what the commotion was all about or was it true that that hill that adjoined to that cliff really was haunted.

All Graham told him was that there was a house up there and that a group of women lived there with their daughters. From what Graham knew, he said that they were a family of witches. He claimed that at night they practiced the dark arts. He warned the boys not to go up there and bring trouble to themselves.

Few days later, Charles and his gang cycled towards that same beach.&nbsp; They cycled up the wooded hills but at one point, they had to leave their bikes behind and hike on their own. The boys climbed the hills until they finally were on top.&nbsp; It was a hill full of trees. Charles and gang went out for an explore. The boys kept on exploring until they finally saw a large mansion from a distance. Also not far from the where the boys could see were three girls playing.&nbsp; Charles and his gang walked towards where the girls were playing. He did not recognize any of the girls as none of them went to his school. As Charles and the four boys were closing in on where the girls were,&nbsp; the three girls started noticing them. Two were Brunettes but one was a Redhead. All three girls were dressed in what looked like rags. Charles thought they must be poor.

�Who are you boys? What are you doing up in our hill?� one of the Brunettes asked them in a rude angry tone.

�We don&#8217;t like trespassers in our land!� taunted the redhead.

�Your land? Do you own this land?� Charles spoke back.

It wasn&#8217;t much a question but that Charles was shocked. 

�Are you from Constantinople&#8217;s Lot? We haven&#8217;t seen you before!� exclaimed Alex.

�What is Constantinople&#8217;s Lot?� the second Brunette asked. .

Charles and the four boys laughed at that girl&#8217;s ignorance. 

�These girls are stupid. Can&#8217;t you see how stupid they are. I mean look at their clothes. They are some poor beggars living up here. Perhaps they live next to that house,&nbsp; begging for food and money,�&nbsp; Charles happily making fun of the three girls.

�That is our home!� responded the first Brunette.

�Yeah right,� Thomas snorted.

The five boys continued laughing,&nbsp; making fun of the three girls. The house was so big and looked as if rich people lived in them.&nbsp; These three girls looked so poor that there was no&nbsp; way they could have been living in that house. To live in that house, those girls would be wealthy and wealthy people dressed nicely and spoke more intelligently.

�Don&#8217;t laugh at us!� screamed the first Brunette. �Stop laughing or I&#8217;ll put a curse on all of you.�

The five boys stopped laughing. They just heard her threatening them with a curse. Charles gulped. 

�Yup. That is right. We are witches. You heard those stories what they say about us. It&#8217;s all true,� the redhead smiled wickedly.

Charles and the other boys felt uncomfortable. They believed the stories now. Graham said that the women who lived in that house had daughters. He never said what they looked like. From what Charles and the kids read about witches was that they had ragged clothes. These three girls were indeed young witches

�Look. We didn&#8217;t know anyone lived up here. If this is your land then we are sorry. We didn&#8217;t know. We will just go now. We promise never to come back again,� Charles spoke in a scared tone.

He was sweating. He would hate it if these girls did put hexes on them. 

We should have listened to Graham. We should have stayed away,&nbsp; all the boys collectively thought. 

Before Charles and the other four boys could walk away,&nbsp; the first Brunette walked forward.

�Wait. Stop. There is penalty for just even coming up here. You boys have to be punished,� the first Brunette spoke.

�That&#8217;s not fair,� Thomas sighed in fear.

�Just shut up fatty!� the redhead scolded Thomas.

Thomas hated being reminded about how fat he was but being called fatty really hurt.&nbsp; Thomas looked upset and felt hurt. The girls just kept on insulting him.

�Fat pig! Fat pig! Fat pig!� they cruelly taunted the poor boy.

The way the girls were taunting Thomas was scaring even the other boys. It was the way they were bravely making fun of him. It was if they did not care and knew they could get away with it. 

Thomas then started crying.

�Leave him alone!� screamed Pete.

�Or you&#8217;ll do what??&nbsp; Are you that stupid to fight a couple of witches,� the second Brunette spoke like a smartass.

�The punishment is that you boys would now have to be our slaves!� the first Brunette chuckled wickedly.

�Slaves?? I don&#8217;t want to be a slave,� panicked Brady. 

� I don&#8217;t want to be a slave! I want to go home,� cried Alex.

All five boys started crying,&nbsp; with tears flowing down their eyes. They didn&#8217;t want to be slaves to a bunch of witches who were about the same age as they were. In fact they didn&#8217;t want to be slaves to a bunch of girls period.

�How long are you going to keep us as slaves??� Thomas cried.

�For the rest of your lives.&nbsp; Now I want all of you to shut up and kneel!� the first Brunette ordering them. 

The five boys did not want to be humiliated like this. To be degraded like this. 

�No!!&nbsp; You can&#8217;t make us!! That&#8217;s not right! That&#8217;s not fair!� Charles crying out to all three girls defiantly.
 
Charles was the gang leader. His friends were more than just friends. They were his best friends. They were the closest thing he had to having brothers. Since it was his idea that they should come up here, it was only right that he should take responsibility and speak out on their behalf.

The First Brunette looked angrily at Charles. She then had a wicked smile. A very wicked smile. Charles and the boys saw her walked towards where a snail was crawling. 

�If you don&#8217;t do what I say I will transfer all your souls into the bodies of these snails. You will all become repulsive. You will never see your parents again. I mean your parents won&#8217;t even recognize you as their own children.&nbsp; No one is going to want any of you anymore,� the first brunette cruelly taunted all of them.

�No one except us. Once you are snails, we are going to keep you as pets. We might even play with you. But when we are bored with you�� the second Brunette speaking cruelly.

The Redhead stomped the ground next to where the snail was. 

All three girls gave all five boys their most wicked looks.

�Now kneel,� the first Brunette screamed towards them. 

Charles and the boys were scared that these girls meant business.&nbsp; They were scared that if they did not surrender and sacrifice their pride, these girl-witches would be nasty enough to turn them all into snails. 

Charles and the other boys dropped to their knees. The three girls just laughed at them. 

�Now I want you all to walk around like dogs. I want to hear you all start barking!� ordered the first Brunette.

Charles and his friends were crawling on all fours, making barking sounds.

�Woof woof,� the boys barked altogether.

The three girls had all sorts of fun with Charles and his friends. Now that they were their slaves.&nbsp; All three girls used three of the boys as human chairs,&nbsp; sitting on their backs. As for the other two boys, the girls just rested their feet on their backs, as if they were stools. 
The boys could hear the girls making fun of them. They said all kinds of things.

�Now we have nice chairs.�

�Why are boys so stupid sometimes.�

�They make god resting stools.�

�What else should we do with our slaves?�

The First Brunette often used Charles as her human chair while making the four other boys put hands on their heads and start squatting up and down. While they were forced to move like this, they had to croak like frogs. 

�I am sitting on your fearless leader here and you boys are behaving like frogs� the first Brunette mocking all four of them. 

What saved the boys from further humiliation was when the girls&#8217; mother started calling out to them. All three girls stopped what they were doing and ran towards a spot where their moms could see them.&nbsp; Charles and the other boys quickly got up and ran towards the direction where they originally climbed from.&nbsp; 

Charles was the last person to climb down but as his feet finally touched bottom ground,&nbsp; the first Brunette appeared above him.

�Where are you going slave?� she taunted him.

�Away from you,� Charles screamed back. 

�You better be back tomorrow or else,� The first Brunette shouted at him at him.

�Or else what??� he cried back.

�If you are not here tomorrow afternoon, I am going to put a curse on you,� she threatened him.

Charles and the boys ran as fast as they could. They ran until they reached the spot where they left their bikes. The got on their bicycles,&nbsp; cycling all the ay down from the wooded hills,&nbsp; until they reached the beach spot. 

�I am never going up there again,� Thomas breathing heavily.

�Hey Thomas you peed on your pants,� Alex told him in a scared tone.

Thomas looked down on his pants. He pissed on it. 

�Looks like we all did Alex,� commented Pete.

The boys looked at themselves and each other. They all had pissed on their pants. They peed on themselves because they were scared of the witches&nbsp; 

�Charles you heard what she said. She wants us to come back here tomorrow. She threatened us to come. You know what&#8217;s gonna happen if we don&#8217;t come,� Brady talking in a scared tone. 

�No Brady. We are not coming back here tomorrow. Our parents are going to kill us if they found out we came here. If we bring them here, we could make things worse. We have to tell our parents a story. We can&#8217;t tell them the truth,� Charles telling all of them.

�So what do we do tell our parents Charles?� Alex asked.

�We have to say that we thought we saw a large anima on the woods and that it scared the hell out of us. They have to know why we dirtied ourselves. Our moms are gonna kill us!� Charles commented angrily.

He was angry that those three girls humiliated them and even got away with it. The boys finally cycled away,&nbsp; back towards their homes. 

But that wasn&#8217;t going to be the last time those boys were going to see those three witches.

Ever since Charles and the boys met those three girls,&nbsp; their lives were never the same again. They could not concentrate on their studies and started doing badly on all their subjects. They started seeing things that weren&#8217;t there. They had nightmares every night.&nbsp; It was as if bad luck and misfortune followed them wherever they went. 

�That girl really is a witch. She cursed us,� Charles told the other guys one day inside the school cafeteria.

Charles then told the rest of the kids in their school about the three girls whom they met. They told them they went up that hill that was supposed to be haunted and where some witches lived. Charles and his gang cooked up some story about how they hid behind some bushes and saw the three girls conducting their black magic. The kids in school believed them. 

Prior to Halloween Charles and his gang were busy learning more about witches and witchcraft and learned about all kinds of ways of dealing with them. They even read about how witches were punished during the Middle Ages. There were even techniques on how to prove if someone was a witch. Many suspicious looking women and young girls&nbsp; had been tied and dunk into rivers. If they survived, it proved that they really were witches. 

On the 31st of October 2004,&nbsp; Halloween Night,&nbsp; Charles and a group of other kids went out trick or treating. They wore all kinds of costumes. Charles was dressed up a policeman. Brady was dressed up as Robin Hood. Thomas was dressed up as a werewolf. Alex was dressed up as a vampire. Pete was dressed up as a wizard. 

On that same night,&nbsp; the rest of the school followed Charles. They followed him on their bicycles. They cycled all the way to that hill. That same hill where the three girls lived. Charles and the kid climbed up that hill,&nbsp; bringing with them loads of rotten eggs. 

Charles influenced the other kids into assisting his gang into throwing rotten eggs all over the mansion where the girls lived. As for why Charles even dared to even think boiled down to one thing: revenge. Revenge for the humiliation of him and his friends. Revenge for 

The kids mercilessly threw rotten eggs all over the mansion&#8217;s walls. The mistake was when they started throwing them on the windows too. They heard some women screaming from inside the mansion. The kids ran as fast as they could and climbed down the hill. They fled and never looked back.

Two weeks later,&nbsp; Charles and his four friends saw that same three girls standing outside their school. School was over and the kids went out. It was when they went out that they saw her.&nbsp;&nbsp; Charles and the four boys walked over to them on the other side of the street.&nbsp; They were still dressed in their rags. 

�What do you want?� Charles screamed at her.

�You are going to pay for having thrown eggs at my house. We know you were behind it. Don&#8217;t say it wasn&#8217;t you,� the first Brunette spoke to Charles in a cold menacing tone.

This time Charles and his gang were not scared. The other kids were also coming out of the school and they were not alone.&nbsp; Charles looked towards the other kids and screamed.&nbsp; He shouted at all of them.&nbsp; He told them that the three witches were here.&nbsp; All th kids looked up and saw the three girls too.

�Come on guys. Let&#8217;s get &#8216;em,� Brady cried.

The kids then started chasing after the three girls. The three girls didn&#8217;t look so tough now. They ran,&nbsp; as they were now the ones who were scared. Charles and the kids started calling them witches,&nbsp; while they were running.&nbsp; The three girls ran all the way into some woods.&nbsp; The other two witch girls managed to get away as far as possible by running into different directions. Everyone was now chasing that first Brunette. That first witch. 

They finally caught her. The kids overpowered her and grabbed her from all her sides,&nbsp; then lifting her body up.&nbsp; Charles and his gang directed the other kids to follow them all the way to the nearby river. When they reached the river back,&nbsp; the river current was moving very rapidly. That girl-witch begged them not to hurt her or throw her into the river. On Charles&#8217;s orders,&nbsp; they threw her down the river stream. Once her body hit the moving river current,&nbsp; she was crying and screaming for help.&nbsp; It seemed that she couldn&#8217;t swim and struggled under the current. 

Charles and the kids simply laughed. As far as they were concerned she was an evil witch and she got what she deserved. Charles and the four boys didn&#8217;t think whether she was going to die or not. They only thought that the river would take care of her and that would be the end of her and her curses. 

As Charles and the ids continued laughing,&nbsp; a man from town appeared out of nowhere and jumped into the river to save that girl.&nbsp; Charles and the rest of the kids quickly dispersed. What followed next was that the next day at school,&nbsp; the principal forced all the primary students to stand up for hours at the assembly. It appeared that the man who saved that witch girl told the principal what had happened and eventually some of the students came up forward,&nbsp; and told the principal who was the ringleader.

The principal called Charles&#8217; parents to come to the office and when they did, he told them what happened. The principal reminded Charles&#8217; parents that that poor girl could have drowned and so Charles had to be punished. At home he was grounded and in school, he had to detention and some community service under supervision of course. He had to do this for a month. 

As for that witch-girl,&nbsp; her mother went to the town constable and told him what had happened. The town constable didn&#8217;t act straightaway and instead told the mayor about how a bunch of kids from town carried that woman&#8217;s daughter and threw her down the river. As a result a tow meeting had been launched, where the town mayor had told the towns&#8217; parents and their children about how wrong it was to go and attack one innocent little girl. 

The girl&#8217;s mother wanted compensation. She wanted the same children who threw her daughter down the river to be punished but the mayor brushed it aside and said that they were just young children who didn&#8217;t know any better. 

The month after,&nbsp; Charles&#8217;s parents finally left town. They took Charles with them. 













Chapter 10



Back to Charles&#8217;s house Party



�Man that is some story Brady. No wonder I forgot about the whole thing. I was embarrassed. I guess I tried hard not to remember any of it. Dad said that he got a new job in the city and that we were going to start our new lives there. Prior to us leaving Constantinople&#8217;s Lot, I never remembered any of this. The Halloween incident. Us climbing over the hill,� Charles confessing.

Brady was leaning his back against the house&#8217;s exterior wall. Thomas and Alex were sat down ion the grassy ground. Pete was the only stood next to Charles.

�So now I know why my dad decided to leave town. I embarrassed him,�&nbsp; Charles sighed.

�Charles that girl who we threw down the river was Ivy. She was the same one who made those cursing threats against us. The truth was that she wasn&#8217;t a witch. When you left us, it was only years later we learned about the truth,� Brady spoke.

�The truth�.about what??� Charles was confused.

�Who Ivy and the girls really were! Why they were always living up there in the hills and never came down.&nbsp; It turns out that the reason why Graham was bullshitting us was because he didn&#8217;t want us to get involve with Ivy&#8217;s mom and the other women living with her. In fact the whole town was playing this game of cold war with her,� Brady spoke.

�Who was she? Who were they? Her mother? The other girls? Their mothers?� asked Charles.

�They were Travellers who had decided to live in this town,� blurted Pete.

�What do you mean Travellers? Like they travel around? You mean they were&nbsp; gypsies?� asked Charles.

�Something like that. Actually they claimed to be gypsies too and that they had knowledge of the dark arts and all that shit. When they came into this town, people ignored them. Apparently that house that they were living in, belonged to a wealthy eccentric. When he died, he told the guy in charge of his will to leave his house and all his money to those women. Those women and their daughters. Apparently he felt sorry for them and he had no children to give his property away to. He thought they had no home and no money and so felt sorry for them. When he was long gone, they then moved into that house,&nbsp; continuing to live how they always lived. That was why Ivy and the girls back then had rags for clothes. I mean they have a servant who travels to town and does their shopping for them. You never see their mothers come into town. They always stay up there. But you did something that changed everything,� Brady said,&nbsp; shaking his head.

�I did??� Charles asked in astonishment.

Pete and Brady nodded their heads.

�Since you left town,&nbsp; Ivy and the rest of the girls styaretd to intermingle more with the townspeople. Normally they had always kept to themselves,&nbsp; up in their stupid hill. . They wanted to get to know the rest of the townspeople and cleared up any misunderstandings. After all, it was a man from town who saved her life and so she thought that there were some nice people in town they could become friends with. Some of the townspeople got to know them a little bit better and even became friends with them. The girls themselves started dressing up like some of the other girls. Of course they still never went to our school. Ivy was known to have dated a guy in school. He felt bad about that day when he helped dunk her down the river and she was willing to give him a chance as he was only a kid then and believed in your bullshit about her being some witch,� Brady talked.

�I think it was that guy Samuel. Hey he is here in this party. How about I go look for him and bring him here. He can tell you his experience about Ivy. The whole school knew about it. Wait here. I&#8217;ll go inside the house and look for him,�&nbsp; offered Alex.

Alex got up from the ground and left the gang. Alex returned with Samuel in four minutes. Samuel was a skinny freckled guy with ginger hair. 

�Hey Sam tell Charles here about you having gone out with Ivy,� Alex ushering him.

�Hey Charles it&#8217;s good to see you again. Yeah I actually dated her. I think it was years ago. She never went to our school. God wondered why her mom never enrolled her into school I mean the town mayor made us apologize to them, by having shamed us in front of Ivy, those other gypsy girls and their mothers. I took her out on a couple of dates but she insisted that we were just hanging out.&nbsp; I tried to kiss her but boy oh boy, she kicked my ass. You may have thought she put a curse on you mate but she sure has put one on me. That girl knows martial arts,� Samuel chuckled.

�Was that why you guys chickened out at that moment when she came and when&nbsp; you guys had me cornered?� Charles asking all the other four boys.

�You can say that,� chuckled Alex. 

�Well I hate to say this but that was your fault. If you didn&#8217;t make us throw her down the river, she wouldn&#8217;t have learned to start defending herself. The way she sometimes to talk, she sounded pretty much up to date on everything. Maybe she decided to know what went on around the world by getting herself an Internet connection in their place,� Pete spoke.

�I created a monster,� Charles sighed.

�Well we have seen her beat up some other guys before. These were guys who harassed her and her friends or made their moves on her,� Thomas added in.

�Mate when we sometimes bump into her, she would sometimes bring you up. She would never let us forget that day when we threw her down the river or that day when we first went over to her place. She really hated your guts and still does. She scared us with all the things she had said about you,� Brady spoke in a concerned tone.

�Oh yes Charles. When I was alone with her and Megan and Kathy, she said she wished you were there so she could teach you a lesson you&#8217;ll never forget,� Samuel contributing to the conversation.

�What do you guys mean? Like she wants revenge on me??� asked Charles.

�Someone in school, said that you vowed to return to this town one day and she was actually looking forward to that day,� Alex commented.

�After all these years she still has a vendetta against me,� Charles spoke,&nbsp; sounding a bit worried.

�Mate I have seen her dark side. Not once. Many times. Believe me. You don&#8217;t want to go there,� Samuel spoke in a worried tone.

�Charles for your own good, just listen to all of us. We love you. Don&#8217;t see her anymore. She didn&#8217;t know your name then but she always referred to you as &#8216;our fearless leader&#8217;. She doesn&#8217;t know any of our names perhaps except for Sam here. If she learns who you really are or why you have come back to this town, you are going to be sorry. Very very sorry,� warned Brady.














Chapter 11



Sunday Night



Charles was inside his bedroom,&nbsp; sat in front of his PC.&nbsp; He was online. He was surfing the net. Charles had spent the whole day helping his mom clean up the house. He was glad that she threw that party yesterday or else he wouldn&#8217;t have met his old friends.&nbsp; He exchanged cell phone numbers with them. He still remembered Brady&#8217;s story.

Charles looked at his computer&#8217;s timer. It was 9:45PM. He turned around and looked towards his window. His window was open and the curtains drawn aside.&nbsp; The sun was going down. Charles didn&#8217;t mind summer but he didn&#8217;t want it to be too hot. Charles looked back to his PC screen again.

Charles was trying his best not to think about Ivy. Brady said she was bad news and Sam knew it from first-hand experience. Charles never asked his mom about the things he did and she probably forgave him for it, or else they wouldn&#8217;t be living again in Constantinople&#8217;s Lot.

A part of Charles still had feelings for Ivy. She was always so nice to him but would that all change if she found out whom he was? Would she then turn on him? He hoped that they could just kiss and make up. He thought he could still hang out with her and not tell her who he was. 

He wasn&#8217;t sure whether to text her or not. He didn&#8217;t yesterday and thought maybe he should let her text him first.&nbsp; Right now all he was doing was chatting online with his school friends from Manchester. He told all his old mates Jim and Norman about Ivy and what he did to her when he was a little kid. 


Norman:
Just don&#8217;t tell her who you are

Jim:
Yeah but she is gonna find out sooner and later

Charles:
Can&#8217;t stop thinking about her. She looked like a witch then and looks like an angel now

Norman:
I guess it&#8217;s karma for the way you treated her

Jim:
Norman? What are you saying?

Norman:
Just joking man

Charles:
Norman is right. I guess I get what I deserved. Maybe I can tell her that I am a different person from the boy I was 7 years ago J

Jim:
That is just wishful thinking mate. I know a best way. You have a PS3 right? Go buy yourself a new video game. That will keep your mind off her. I think your old mate Brady is right mate. Forget about her. Better yet. Hook up with some of the other chicks from your old school. That should help. 

Five minutes later, Charles went offline. He went down to the lounge and set up his video game console. He played some video games. He wanted to stop thinking about Ivy. Even while playing Mortal Kombat for just an hour,&nbsp; he could only briefly stop thinking about Ivy. He hated it that his feelings for her were very strong.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *********


For more than a week,&nbsp; Charles hadn&#8217;t spoken to Ivy. He never text her. She never text him. He had also never seen that much of her in town. The town was small, but that was only in regards to its population. Land-wise, the town could fill in ten times the number of the people living in it now. He managed to get hold of some of the other town girls&#8217; numbers from Brady and Pete. 

Charles had gone out on so many dates. His mom was glad for him. He often took the girls out to the diners or the movies. Unfortunately for him, there were no malls in Constantinople&#8217;s Lot.&nbsp; But whether there were or weren&#8217;t any malls in Constantinople&#8217;s Lot, that never stopped him from making out with at least two girls whom he dated. There were always those empty beaches.&nbsp; 

During the day Charles would diligently work in his mom&#8217;s shop. He would stock up the shelves with all kinds of electronic items or household items. He would also soaked cloth to wipe out the dusts off the shelves so that dirt didn&#8217;t build up.

The only guy who ever visited Charles in the shop during the day was Thomas. Brady, Pete and Alex also had day jobs. Charles often met the other guys when they were all going out for their breaks. They would hook up at a diner. Sometimes they ate at the first diner he ate at &#8211; The Crusaders.&nbsp; Brady introduced the waitress to Charles and told her that he was indeed from their hometown but left it when he was seven. The waitress&#8217;s name was Marlene. Marlene was a lot nicer to Charles once they got better acquainted. 

It was sometimes after work where Charles would meet up with Brady and the rest of the gang. They were just catching up to old times. If Charles and any of the guys didn&#8217;t come to hang out at night, it was only because one of them had a date with a girl. When Charles hung out with Brady and the other guys, it was often at pubs where they would all play pool. Sometimes Charles spent the evenings in his house,&nbsp; either playing video games or being online and chatting with his other friends.

It was finally one night where he couldn&#8217;t stand it anymore and started trying to ring her cell phone number. He really missed her and didn&#8217;t care what Brady said. She didn&#8217;t pick up the phone and so he left her a text message:

Haven&#8217;t seen you in a long time. How are you? 

Ivy never responded to his text message. One day while he was working, Charles took out his cell phone and sent her more text messages:

Wanna hang out? Miss your company

Since she never responded,&nbsp; he assumed that either she left town or that she found out who he was and wanted to have nothing to do with him. 

At night, Charles often slept somewhere before or after midnight. He only had to get up by nine in the morning for breakfast and to help him open up the shop. Charles sometimes dreamt of that moment when he and the other school kids chased Ivy and threw her down the river. Then he had other dreams. Those other dreams disturbed him and were more like nightmares. 

He had different nightmares,&nbsp; and they all involved Ivy. One nightmare he had was about the two of them being alone at night inside some diner. The diner&#8217;s door was closed and all the lights slowly turned off. The only light coming through was from the moonlight shining through the diner window. Ivy was dressed up in her usual tough girl outfit and had a wicked look. 

�How come all the lights are off. Where is everybody?� he would always ask her.

Deep down he was afraid that she was going to do something. 

�It looks it&#8217;s just the two of us,� Ivy would say.

Then it was usually that moment that Ivy would get up the table and she would be holding a large knife in her hand. Charles would be paralyzed with fear and she would just keep on stabbing. She would be laughing evilly while doing the act so many times. 

Then there was another nightmare. They would be alone on some boat,&nbsp; in the middle of some lake. It would be night time. He and Ivy would be sitting on opposite ends of the boat. Then she would get up and open her mouth. She has sharp vampire-like fangs and her eyes would turn red. Large batwings would spring out of her back. Charles would scream,&nbsp; wanting to wake up or close his eyes. In this nightmare she always revealed herself to be a vampire. Charles would scream while she taunted him in a cruel tone. He would just jump off the boat and continue swimming while she flew after him on air. 

�You will never escape me Charles. Never,� Ivy would scream in some demonic voice.

There was another nightmare where he would be locked at night in his school. His last school in Manchester. He would be running as Ivy. Megan and Katherine would be chasing after him with knives. Then they would finally corner him at a spot where he would see the severed heads of all his guy friends on poles. It was disturbing. Whenever he saw the severed heads of Brady or Pete or Thomas or Alex,&nbsp; his stomach would be having butterflies in them. 

�You tried to kill me Charles. You all tried to kill me,� Ivy would be making her pretending-to-be-sad tone. 

Deep down it was haunting and scary as he knew her to be sarcastic. Ivy would then start showing her wicked smile and then raise her large knife. Charles would always raise his arms in font of him, as if trying to defend himself. 

�Now I am going to kill you,� Ivy would speak in a cold tone.

It was usually after this nightmare when he would wake up,&nbsp; sweating.

�Just a dream,� he would say to himself.

Then there would be that other voice coming from beside him in the bed. 

�No Charles. Not just a dream. You are having a nightmare,� that other voice would say.

He would turn around to face Ivy beside him on the bed. His heart would be beating very fast. She would always be holding a knife.&nbsp; Then he would finally wake up. Charles blamed his nightmares on all those horror films he had been watching over the years. 

One day while stocking up one of the shelves, he heard his cell phone beeping. He stopped working and took out his cell phone. He had 1 message. He clicked on it. It was from Ivy. His heart was pounding, from both fear and excitement. He then began to open up her text message. It said:

Sorry I haven&#8217;t spoken to you in a long time. I really miss you. I want to see you. Can I see you tonight? Alone. Just the two of us. 

She wanted to be alone with him? This had been the moment Charles had been waiting for. He quickly replied to her text message:

Yes sure. I wanna to see u too. 

He put his cell phone away and went back to work. He heard his cell phone beeping five minutes later. He took it out. It was from Ivy. She had replied to his reply. He clicked on her message and read it:

How about by that cliff near your house? I know where your house is. Someone said that was the house where the party was being held a couple of weeks ago. So you moved into that house. Cool. Sorry that I couldn&#8217;t come to your party. Can we meet by that cliff at 9:30 tonight? The sunset view there is good. 

Charles quickly responded:

Yes definitely.

Two minutes later she text him again for the last time:

C u at 9:30 J then
























Chapter 12



Charles looked at his cell phone.&nbsp; It was 9:29PM.&nbsp; The sun looked as if it was setting.&nbsp; The sky was looking as it was becoming dusk.&nbsp; Dusk during summer time. From the cliff,&nbsp; he had a good view of the sea.&nbsp; Even through the cliff was very high,&nbsp; he could still hear the waves below him roaring.&nbsp; The only thing he saw flying on the air were seagulls and on the sea,&nbsp; no one. Not even boats. Charles now learned that by standing by the cliff, he couldn&#8217;t make out a view of his home. Between his home and the cliff were a couple of trees. 

From what seemed like a mile away,&nbsp; he could see someone coming towards his direction.&nbsp; 

She&#8217;s here,&nbsp; Charles thought.

�She� being Ivy. The girl of his dreams.&nbsp; And nightmares.

Charles waited until she finally approached. When she was just ten meters of his range, he waved at her.&nbsp; Ivy waved back at him. As he got a closer look at her, he was surprised at what she was wearing. She wasn&#8217;t dressed in her bad girl clothes. She was dressed in pink jogging clothes; with white jogging shoes and she wore her long brown hair in a ponytail. 

�You look great. You also look different. You ditched your bad girl appearance??� he asked her in a joking way.

He was just glad to see her.

�Let&#8217;s say I decided to go jogging before I was going to bump into you,� Ivy&nbsp; smiled.

Ivy moved closer to him.&nbsp; Before he could say a word or make a move, she gave him a warm hug. He was touched. He hugged her back. She let go of him and then he let go of her.

�Ivy you have no idea how glad I am to see you,� Charles smiled.

�I am glad to see you too,� Ivy replied.

Ivy then moved closer to the cliff&#8217;s edge.

�The view here is just so good,� Ivy looking up to the sky. 

From where Charles was stood,&nbsp; it looked as if she was standing exactly where the edge of the cliff was. He was worried. For her. he quickly walked to where she was.

�Ivy,&nbsp; I think�� Charles was about to warn her.

But when he moved a little bit closer to where she was,&nbsp; she quickly moved away.&nbsp; Charles then slowly slipped towards the edge,&nbsp; with only a small rock near him.&nbsp; Before he could blink his eyes, he found himself hanging on the edge of the cliff. His hands were holding on that one small rock. If he let go, he was going to fall down and die. 

�Ivy!!&nbsp; Help me!! I am going to fall!!� he cried.

Charles&#8217;s heart was beating,. His hands were strong but not strong enough to help him to pull himself up. 

�Ivy!&nbsp; Help me!!� he cried to her for help.

Ivy just stood there. She stood there,&nbsp; looking cold. 

Oh my God. It&#8217;s all true. She really does want me to die. She finally found out who I really am, Charles panicked. 

Ivy quickly crouched by the side of the stone. She had a wicked smile on her face.

�You know no one can hear you scream. If I don&#8217;t help you out, you are going to fall. You are going to fall in five minutes. Your hands won&#8217;t be able to hold on for long. I am going to help you Charles. I am going to do something good for you, which is far better than what you did to me so many seven years ago. I am going to save your life but only one condition,� Ivy dictated to him cruelly. 

�Name it. I don&#8217;t want to die,� Charles cried. 

�I didn&#8217;t want to die either when you had the other kids threw me down the river,� Ivy spoke to him bitterly.

�You want money?� Please don&#8217;t let me die. I&#8217;m sorry for what I did to you. I was only a kid for fuck&#8217;s sakes,� Charles cried like a little boy.

�Charles if I help you up, do you promise on your grandparents&#8217; graves to be my personal obedient loyal slave for the rest of your life?� Ivy asked him in a serious tone. 

Charles&#8217;s arm muscles were starting to ache.

�But my grandparents aren&#8217;t dead Ivy,� Charles was breathing heavily. 

I don&#8217;t know how much longer I can hold on to this small rock, Charles thought. 

�Not on your mother&#8217;s idiot. On your father&#8217;s side. Now do you swear or not?� Ivy becoming bullying inn her tone.

Charles nodded,&nbsp; with fear in his face.

�I swear. Just don&#8217;t let me fall,� Charles begged,&nbsp; sounding even louder and more hysterical. 

Charles was crying,&nbsp; with tears rolling down his scared green eyes. Ivy was the only thing that stood between him and death.&nbsp; Ivy then lowered down her body by that stone,&nbsp; offering her arm to Charles. 

�Charles grab hold of my arm and try to climb up� Ivy advised him.

Charles got hold of one of her arm. He then used it as a leverage to help him move up,&nbsp; towards the cliff&#8217;s ground. He then used Ivy&#8217;s body weight as a means of pulling himself up, as she lay in the ground. Charles managed to use both arms to grab hold of her back,&nbsp; then thrusting his upper body onto the ground. He moved his body like a worm,&nbsp; also using his hands to touch the cliff ground. He was like a soldier wiggling his body under enemy fire or by moving below barbed wires. 

Charles&#8217;s entire body was finally on the cliff&#8217;s ground. He was panting and panting and panting. He got up in 5 minutes, as he was managed to breathe more oxygen into his body system. He looked at Ivy. She just stood there,&nbsp; looking bitter.

�Yes I know who you are. I found out who you are. Your full name is Charles Greene. My sources told me that you were the same bully who left town seven years ago. Only now you are living alone with mommy. That same bully being the same one who threw rotten eggs at my house on Halloween and who had me thrown down the river. I would have died if it had not been for that guy who came to my rescue. When I cried for help you just stood there and laughed. You and all your friends. Yet I saved yours. You owe me�..twice. Your life is mine. You belong to me now,� Ivy scolded him, as if he were a little school kid.

�I&#8217;m sorry about what I did to you before. Look kids do stupid things,� Charles emotionally defending himself.

�You wanna know something Ironic Charles. I actually saved your life twice. The first time was when your own friends did not recognize you. Your old childhood friends. Remember that day? On the woods? You know that your good friend Pete was going to stab you. Now imagined if had not come then. Better yet. If I had known who you were then, I probably would have let them put you through hell the way you put me through hell that day,� Ivy speaking&nbsp; bitterly. 

Charles was angry about how she was making him feel low and guilty. 

�You want to know something Charles. I actually had feelings for you when we started hanging out.&nbsp; I really really liked you.&nbsp; Then you bullshitted me about being new in town. It sounded as if you were trying to hide your past,� Ivy cried bitterly.

�It&#8217;s not like that. Look. I didn&#8217;t remember anything I did. People here told me things I did as a boy. If I told you I was from town and you say you didn&#8217;t recognize me, I was afraid you were going to give me trouble like my friends did� Charles cried back.

Ivy and Charles just stared at each other.

�Well you swore on your grandparents&#8217; graves that you will become my slave. So now I order you to kneel!� she ordered him.

Charles was reluctant. He wanted to defend his pride and honour. 

�So you are not a man of your word at all. Well what did I expect? I mean what could I expect from a crook like you!!� she scolded him.

�Look Ivy. Please don&#8217;t do this to me. I am grateful that you saved me. Twice. Can&#8217;t we just start all over again?� he begged.

He still had feelings for her.&nbsp; Even if they didn&#8217;t end up as enemies,&nbsp; he still didn&#8217;t want them to give each other the cold shoulder or silent treatment. 

Ivy turned around and walked away. Charles chased after her. 

�Look Ivy. I&#8217;m really sorry about all this,� Charles panicked.

As Charles was about to grab Ivy&#8217;s shoulder, she instinctively turned around, grabbed his arm and tossed him over her body. His body slammed towards the ground. As he was lying on the ground, she quickly kicked him on the stomach. He screamed in pain. She then turned his body over to the ground, grabbed his left arm and twisted it behind his back.

�Ouucchh,� Charles screamed.

�Listen to me Charles. If you want things to go well between us,&nbsp; I suggest you better honour our agreement. Am I understood??� she asked him in an angry tone.

She was hurting his arm. He nodded his head.

�Good,� Ivy smiled.

Ivy let go of his left arm. 

�Now kneel before me slave!� she taunted him cruelly.

Charles slowly got up. He now knew what Samuel meant when he said that Ivy had a dark side. He just experienced it. Charles slowly positioned his body, so as to kneel before Ivy. 

�Good slave,� Ivy smiling at him,&nbsp; with approval.

Charles looked down on the ground while kneeling before Ivy.

�From now on things are going to be different. You will shut up when I tell you to shut up and you will always call me Mistress, whenever I speak to you. You live only for my pleasure and to serve me. Now if you don&#8217;t want me to ever embarrass you in front of this fucking town, you better do what I say without question. Now I want to have a conversation with you somewhere indoors,&nbsp; where the two of us can be alone. After all we don&#8217;t want mommy to know that her only son has become the slave to the local town outcaste,&nbsp; now do we!!� Ivy taunting him.

Ivy then broke out into a small cruel laughter. 

�Mistress please don&#8217;t tell my mom.&nbsp; I beg you,�&nbsp; Charles cried.

Charles broke down into tears and dropped down on his knees. He started groveling and grabbing at Ivy&#8217;s feet,&nbsp; kissing at it.

�Ok you can stop that now.&nbsp; Just be a good obedient Blond male slave and everything will be fine between us,� Ivy speaking to him in an assuring tone.

While he was on his knees and his head just below her knees,&nbsp; she starred grabbing some of his short Blond hair and yanked on it.

�Ok slave. Just shut the fuck up and stand before your Mistress,� she ordered him.

�Yes�yes Mistress,�&nbsp; Charles finishing his sobbing up.

Charles slowly stood up before his Mistress.&nbsp; He was more than a head taller than she was but they were not equals.&nbsp; She was calling all the shots.&nbsp; She owned him. 

�Now slave,&nbsp; I want you to listen to me very closely.&nbsp; Do you still remember where my place is?&nbsp; You and your goons have been there once.&nbsp; In fact I think I took you near there at least once,�&nbsp; she asked him.

Charles remembered Brady telling him that they were there once.&nbsp; Charles remembered how Brady described it. It was on top of a hill that had a cliff overlooking some beach. 

�I don&#8217;t remember mistress,� Charles shook his head.

�My God.&nbsp; Ok. Do you remember on the second day when we hang out. I took you to a beach near some hill,� Ivy reminding him.

Charles remembered that beach spot.&nbsp; That was the same beach leading up to that hill next to her place. His eyes flashed.

�Oh God. Now I see you remember. I can still remember when I took you there and how you said that you don&#8217;t remember ever being there. Well you were there as a little kid with your fucking mates. That was how we first met. Now I suggest go back to your house, grab your bike and meet me here in ten minutes. If your mom asks, just tell her that you and your mates are going to be hanging out. Now go!�&nbsp; she ordered him.

�Yes Mistress,� Charles bowed.



































Chapter 13




Charles followed Ivy all the way to her house on top of the hill. He followed her on his bicycle and they cycled all the way towards that direction of that lonely beach.&nbsp; He cycled behind her,&nbsp; towards a path that he had never been to before.&nbsp; They cycled until they were on top of that hill where she lived.&nbsp; They cycled all the way until he could see her mansion. Charles could not remember what her mansion was like, as he had only been there once and seven years ago.

Ivy&#8217;s mansion was a large building.&nbsp; It&nbsp; was as wide as a hospital and looked as if it was four storey high.&nbsp; 

�Come and follow me slave,� she ordered him.

�Yes Mistress,� he responded in a meek tone. 

They cycled until they reached a part of the mansion that had bike racks. They got off their bikes and tied them to the rack. He then followed her all the way to the front door. The front door faced the driveway where Charles could see a limousine parked right on it. 

She has a driver alright,&nbsp; Charles thought.

Charles followed Ivy,&nbsp; as she climbed up the front steps.&nbsp; She then took out her house key and used it to open her front door. The front door opened up to a large hallway. That hallway had two corridors.&nbsp; One to the front&#8217;s door&#8217;s right&nbsp; and the other to the left.&nbsp; Charles saw two large stairs heading upwards and a hanging giant chandelier above their heads.

Inside the mansion,&nbsp; it was very cool.&nbsp; The whole front hallway was being cooled by some kind of air conditioner. It wasn&#8217;t as hot,&nbsp; like it was outside.&nbsp; 

�You have such a big house�.Mistress,� Charles stammering.

Now he had a low self-esteem. She was really rich. He felt like a peasant visiting royalty. 

�I know I have a big house slave.&nbsp; Now I want you to follow me upstairs,� she ordered him.

They climbed up the stairs.&nbsp; Each step Charles took, he felt more and more like a real slave.&nbsp; Once they were on the top floor,&nbsp; he followed her across hallways until they reached a hallway full of bedroom doors.&nbsp;&nbsp; They walked until they finally reached her bedroom door.&nbsp; Charles noticed that there was a doorbell ring by her door.&nbsp; He thought it was weird. 

She opened it and let them in.

Ivy&#8217;s bedroom was four times as large as Charles&#8217;s.&nbsp; Now he knew why she had a doorbell. Her bedroom was as large as a seminar room. He followed her all over the bedroom.

There was a giant king-sized bed in the middle of the bedroom.&nbsp; He saw&nbsp; a large desk with a PC on top of it.&nbsp; He saw rows of shelves,&nbsp; as if she had her own personal library room,&nbsp; within her bedroom.&nbsp; On one corner of her bedroom, she had a large flat screen TV attached to the wall.&nbsp; It was nearly as big as ones&#8217; in the cinema and right in front of that screen was a large sofa,&nbsp; with a table in front of it.&nbsp;&nbsp; 

If Charles had a bedroom like Ivy&#8217;s,&nbsp; he wasn&#8217;t sure if he was ever going to leave his bedroom. She had everything that he could possibly want. 

�My house is bigger than your house slave.&nbsp; In fact if I decide to do something nasty,&nbsp; like torturing you,&nbsp; this house is so big that the maids and servants won&#8217;t even hear us,�&nbsp; Ivy bragged,.

Charles gulped.&nbsp; He hoped she was only kidding. 

She had maids.&nbsp; He only imagined that somewhere inside her bedroom, she had a special intercom to call them to come up here. He was wondering about Ivy&#8217;s mom and the mothers of Megan and Katherine.&nbsp; Where they home? Where they in the lounge or somewhere else?

�Charles I want you to take off all your clothes,� she ordered him.

�Yes Mistress,� he replied in a meek tone.

Charles slowly took off all his clothes,&nbsp; leaving them on Ivy&#8217;s carpeted bedroom floor.&nbsp; Charles was standing naked,&nbsp; in the middle of her bedroom.&nbsp; Ivy was admiring his good physique.&nbsp; He had a fit body. His biceps looked good. He had a big cock. The only thing she didn&#8217;t like was that he had chest hair and even some body hair,&nbsp; on his legs. She could do something about that,&nbsp; but not tonight.&nbsp; Toni9ght she just wanted to enjoy him as much as she could. 

Ivy then took out her cell phone,&nbsp; making a phone call. 

�Hey Megan what&#8217;s up.&nbsp; Hey where are you and Katherine??� Ivy asked.

�We&#8217;re inside the house.&nbsp; Is Charles with you?�&nbsp; Megan asked from the other side.

�I&#8217;m in my bedroom.&nbsp; Come here quick,�&nbsp; Ivy giggling.

Ivy hung up.&nbsp; 

�Stand straight slave!� Ivy yelled at him.

�Yes Mistress,� Charles responded, as if he was a soldier and she a drill sergeant. 

Charles stood up straight.&nbsp; His arms were to the side of his body and his legs were straight.

�I must say Charles that you do take good care of your body.&nbsp; I must say that I admire you for that,�&nbsp; Ivy teasing him.

Ivy ran her finger from his chest all the way to where his balls were. She then grabbed his balls and squeezed them a little bit harder.&nbsp; Charles made a soft �ooohhh� sound and his face looked uncomfortable. 

�And you got a big dick!� Ivy complimenting his manhood.

Ivy was looking at Charles&#8217;s naked body with a kinky look on his face. 

Five minutes later,&nbsp; the bedroom doorbell rang.&nbsp;&nbsp; Ivy smiled she took out her cell phone.&nbsp; She dialed Megan&#8217;s number. Megan picked up.

�Come right in!� Ivy said.

Ivy hung up. Megan and Katherine walked right into Ivy&#8217;s bedroom. They joined Ivy and Charles at one lone spot inside the bedroom. The two girls saw Charles&#8217;s naked. They were about to burst out laughing but controlled their jaws with their hands. 

�Oh my God. Did he like lose a bet to you or something?� asked Megan.

�On your knees slave!� Ivy ordered Charles.

�Yes Mistress!� Charles responded in a meek tone.

Charles dropped down to his knees.&nbsp; The two other girls were amazed. The two other girls knew who Charles really was,&nbsp; as it was Katherine&#8217;s source who told Katherine, who further told Ivy. Ivy told them what happened at the cliff and how Charles was now her personal slave.

�Well that serves you right you asshole,�&nbsp; Megan yelling at Charles in an angry tone.

�You tried to kill her and yet she saved your useless life. Seven years ago you had the power. Now she has the power. What goes around comes around!!� Katherine belittling Charles.

Charles hated the way these two girls were talking down on him.&nbsp; He looked as if he wanted to cry. 

�I think he is going to cry Ivy,� Megan noticing Charles&#8217;s facial expression.

�Ivy what did you to him??� asked Katherine.

�Well he disobeyed me the first time and then I just put him back his place.&nbsp; Slave I want you to take out my shoe and then kiss my right feet!� Ivy ordered Charles.

�Yes Mistress,� Charles whimpered.

Charles went down on all fours.&nbsp; He crouched his face right over Megan&#8217;s right shoe. Tears rolled own his green eyes but he was controlling himself from fully crying. The way they talked to him. The way Ivy was humiliating him. It was all getting to his ego.&nbsp; His pride. His self-esteem. Charles took off Ivy&#8217;s right shoe off her right foot,&nbsp; with his hands.&nbsp; She had a red sock on.&nbsp; 

�Oh you can take them off too!� Ivy pointing at her red sock,&nbsp;&nbsp; �With that disgusting foul-mouthed mouth of yours. That very same mouth that told the other kids to throw me down the river!!�

All three girls laughed at what Ivy was telling Charles what to do next.&nbsp; Charles smelled her red sock. It smelled horrible. Using his mouth to pull her sock off would be less than degrading. 

�Please Mistress.&nbsp; Can I use my fingers?? I will do a good job,� Charles begged.

He just stared down at her sock and dared not look up to her. 

�I said use your fucking mouth.&nbsp; If I have to repeat myself twice with you, I am going to cut off that tongue of yours!!�&nbsp; Ivy yelled at him.

�Yes Mistress,�&nbsp; Charles responded.

Charles started using his teeth to grab hold of her red sock,&nbsp; then using it to pull it off. 

�See girls. I own him. He will do whatever I say. That makes him my bitch,�&nbsp; Ivy making fun of Charles.

The girls laughed,&nbsp; watching Charles pulling Ivy&#8217;s sock off with his teeth. Once he got the red sock off her foot,&nbsp; he then started licking her right foot. Her foot smelled horrible. 

�Why bother washing my smelly foot when I have a local town boy to do it for me. I mean his tongue is less valuable than some items in my house that really do mean a lot to me,�&nbsp; Ivy telling the other girls.

Charles continued licking Ivy&#8217;s foot, as if he was her dog.&nbsp; 

�Maybe I should make him my new dog. Hey girls what would be a good name for my new dog?� Ivy asked.

�How about Spot!� suggested Megan.

�Isn&#8217;t Charles already good name for a dog? I mean we can have run around on all fours right outside and we can make him fetch sticks and catch Frisbees with!!�&nbsp; suggested Katherine.

These girls were nasty.&nbsp; Really nasty,&nbsp; Charles thought.

He continued licking Ivy&#8217;s smelly foot, trying to block out the nasty things they were saying about him. 

�Imagine if his friends saw him now.&nbsp; Now that would be a sight!!�&nbsp; Megan commented.

Charles&#8217; heart was beating. He didn&#8217;t want to be humiliated in front of his friends. He could imagine Brady and the rest of the guys seeing him degrading himself like this. 

�Charles stop licking my foot.&nbsp; Lie on your back!�&nbsp; Ivy ordered him.

�Yes Mistress!� Charles responded.

Charles was repositioning his body,&nbsp; so that he was laying on his hack towards the bedroom&#8217;s carpeted floor. 

�That won&#8217;t be a good idea Meg.&nbsp; If his friends saw him like this, they would retaliate. I don&#8217;t plan on using him right in front of his own mother. He agreed to be my slave but his mother won&#8217;t,�&nbsp; Ivy remarked.

Ivy then started taking off her jogging pants.&nbsp; She had a black lacy underwear on.&nbsp; She then took it off and she then crouched over Charles&#8217;s face.&nbsp; Charles was now looking up at her ass. 

�Charles I want you to use your tongue and lick my ass clean!�&nbsp; Ivy ordered him.

Ivy pressed her asshole towards his face.&nbsp; It smelled bad. He had to do it as he agreed to be her slave. After all he was sure that she wasn&#8217;t going to humiliate him in public. Charles opened his mouth and started lapping his tongue between her ass cheeks. His tongue was lapping at&nbsp; some ass flesh.&nbsp; He was even tasting bits of what would be her shit. 

�His tongue feels good on my ass!!�&nbsp; Ivy complimenting her slave,&nbsp; �I like his tongue this way.�

�Hey Ivy when you are done with him,&nbsp; can we have some fun with him too??�&nbsp; asked Megan.

�No!!&nbsp; Get your own slave. This one is mine. He is my personal slave,&nbsp; catering to my personal needs,�&nbsp; Ivy being a dominating botch.

�You are such a bitch you know that!�&nbsp; Megan screamed at Ivy.

�Hey Meg let&#8217;s go get something to eat. I will have the maid come and serve us in my bedroom. How do you feel about Peking Duck??� asked Katherine.

�Yeah let&#8217;s get out of here,� Megan spoke in a pissed tone.

The two girls walked away and left Ivy&#8217;s bedroom.&nbsp; Charles heard Megan slamming the bedroom door all the way from he and Ivy were at. 

Ivy made Charles lick her asshole for half-an-hour until she told him to stop. She then took him by the hand,&nbsp; leading him all the way to her bed.&nbsp; She ordered him to lay on his back,&nbsp; on the bed.&nbsp; When he was on her bed,&nbsp; she went to her drawers and took some hand cuffs out.&nbsp; On the upper part and lower part of her bed were bed railings. Since Charles was such a tall guy, it was easy for her to handcuff each&nbsp; wrist and each ankle to the upper and lower railings.&nbsp; Charles was now completely helpless.&nbsp; The last thing she did to him was blindfold him. 

�Now I am going to enjoy myself with you!!�&nbsp; Ivy said to him.

Ivy was stroking his cock,&nbsp; slowly pushing it up her cunt.&nbsp; She had a light brown pubic hair. Ivy was using his large cock to ram her cunt.&nbsp; She made sexual grunting sounds and so did he. Charles liked his cock being inside her. Her flesh felt good. His cock caused her cunt to start cumming. 

After they both cummed,&nbsp; Ivy told him what she wanted him to do.&nbsp; She was going to lick his cock and drink his cum while he licked her pussy and drank her cum juice. She changed her position. Her face faced his large cock while her cunt was onto Charles&#8217;s blindfolded face. They both worked their tongues on each other until Ivy told him to stop. 

Ivy had sex with Charles for an hour. She still let him remained tied up while she sat on his tummy,&nbsp; asking him questions. She asked him what he did everyday and when he was normally free. She already knew about his day job and wanted further confirmation about how his daily life operated. If she could only have him after 7PM everyday,&nbsp; then she had less time to have fun with him and could only have fun with him at night.

Charles told her he worked everyday until 7PM. Everyday except Sunday. Ivy wanted him to pressure his own mother to give him at least another free day in a week.&nbsp; She wanted to have him as a slave for at least another afternoon in a week. 

Ivy finally untied him,&nbsp; telling him that she wanted him to go back home. Ivy told him that it was already nearly 1AM in the morning. As Charles was rushing to put his clothes back on,&nbsp; Ivy spoke to him.

�It&#8217;s a quarter to one. One, as in, one in the morning. Tell your mom that your mates got carried away with the time. Also don&#8217;t forget to ask her to give you at least another free day in a week. Then get back to me,�&nbsp; Ivy telling Charles.

�Yes Mistress!!�&nbsp; Charles responded.

Ivy was giving him a wicked smile.&nbsp; She had plans for him. She was thinking of ways how she was going to have fun with him and use him as her slave. 




























Chapter 14




Charles managed to get back his home without waking up his mother. He quickly crept up into his bedroom. Once he was inside his bedroom, he set his alarm clock up. His life changed tonight. He was no longer a free man. Tonight he began his new life as a slave. As Ivy&#8217;s slave.

While Charles was laying on his bed,&nbsp; under the blanket, he thought of Ivy and that entire night. He hated the fact that he was her slave and how she won against him. 

If only I listened to Brady.&nbsp; If only I did not go near that cliff&#8217;s edge,&nbsp; Charles telling himself.

Before Charles knew it,&nbsp; he grabbed some tissue off his tissue box and started masturbating over his own bed. A part of him liked the fact that Ivy was his Mistress and he was her slave. He was masturbating,&nbsp; stroking his cock over some tissue papers,&nbsp; fantasizing on how she had humiliated and used him tonight. 

He was remembering how she was making him lick her foot,&nbsp; her ass and how she tied him up.&nbsp; He even imagined her doing this to him right there in public.&nbsp; In front of a crowd at a diner&#8217;s.&nbsp; Inside his mom&#8217;s own shop,&nbsp; while customers were just standing there and watching Ivy degrading him like this.

Eventually Charles masturbated until he jacked off too much and had to wipe his cock clean.&nbsp; He had already cummed enough back at Ivy&#8217;s.&nbsp; Five minutes after cleaning himself up,&nbsp; he went to bed.&nbsp; Two minutes after his head hit the pillow,&nbsp; he just fell asleep.&nbsp; Once asleep,&nbsp; his mind started dreaming.&nbsp; He was dreaming of the many different ways that he was going to be humiliated.&nbsp; By&nbsp; Ivy.














&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; **********



Back at Ivy&#8217;s


Ivy was inside Megan&#8217;s bedroom.&nbsp; Megan&#8217;s bedroom was just as large as Ivy&#8217;s.&nbsp; Ivy,&nbsp; Megan and Katherine were sat in front of the large near cinema-sized screen.&nbsp; The bedroom lights were off.&nbsp; It was already 2AM in the morning and all three girls were watching The Exorcist,&nbsp; which was the highest grossing horror film on cinema record. 

�So you understand this Megan. He is not just my slave. I actually still have feelings for that guy. He is an asshole but he is my asshole.&nbsp; He is my personal slave. You know what that means. He caters to my personal needs. If I shared him with you,&nbsp; or let anyone else touch him,&nbsp; it would be like I am sharing my underwear with you.&nbsp; Or sharing the same condom as you. I am sure you understand that.&nbsp; I mean you wouldn&#8217;t want us to share the same tissue paper or the same toilet paper that one of us had just sued to wipe our own ass,&nbsp; do you!!�&nbsp; Ivy making her point.

�Don&#8217;t worry Meg.&nbsp; Ivy is saying that she will help you one day get your own personal male slave. Someone good looking or someone whose guts you hate.&nbsp; Maybe one of Charles&#8217;s friends. I am sure Ivy can coerce him into giving out his own friends&#8217; dirty secrets. When you have their secrets, they become your slaves. You own them,� Katherine backing Ivy up.

The girls turned away from each other and then looked back at the screen.&nbsp; Right now in the screen,&nbsp; the possessed girl was sat up front on the bed and shoving the crucifix up her cunt. 

�Maybe you can have him wear a cross in public and have him shove it right up his ass in the middle of town hall or something!!�&nbsp; chuckled Megan.

All three girls laughed.&nbsp; They may not have been biologically related but they were like sisters. Ivy would have done anything for them.&nbsp; Except share her slave. 

The three girls had dinners with their mothers at the large dining hall,&nbsp; but only on three evenings in a week.&nbsp; The only time their mothers saw them on a day was only when they all had breakfasts together.&nbsp; Apart from their mothers, the only other people who lived in the mansion with them were the servants, maids and the chauffeur. 

The three girls either spent their time together in their own mansion or in town,&nbsp; where they sometimes met the rest of the townsfolk. Some people were good and decent but others were nasty towards them. Those who were nasty were normally much older people who remembered them to be Travelers. To those people, Travelers were like dirt.&nbsp; They saw Travelers the way continental Europeans saw gypsies. 

�Did I ever tell you girls how much I love you?� asked Ivy.

�Ivy you are stealing my question. Normally I ask you two that question,� Megan spoke in a flamboyant tone.&nbsp; 

�You don&#8217;t have to tell us dear. You two know how much I love you both,� Katherine sounding sincerely affectionate.

All three girls move closer to each other,&nbsp; hugging each other tightly.

�No guy is going to come and separate us,� Ivy spoke out emotionally.

�Except your new slave Charles,� Megan responded emotionally and sarcastically at the same time.

�Oh thanks Meg. You know how to make a girl feel good,� Ivy joked.





























Chapter 15




Charles met up with Ivy and the other girls at the pub called Moonshine.&nbsp; He cycled there after work and reached the pub around 8PM.&nbsp; Once inside the pub, he was once more Ivy&#8217;s slave. Charles and all three girls were seated by a table near the pub window. Charles and Ivy were sat one end while Megan and Kate were sat on the other end. Ivy&#8217;s feet were lying on Charles&#8217;s lap.&nbsp; He was massaging her feet and she loved it. In public he does not call her Mistress and he takes orders from her, in a way that the other people don&#8217;t notice. Loud music was playing in the background.

�So you asked your mom what days you can have free?� Ivy asked Charles.

�Mom said I could have Thursdays free,� Charles responded.

�So I can have you on two days in a week when the sun is still up.&nbsp; Not counting summer time of course,� Ivy making a funny face towards the other two girls.

Megan and Katherine smirked. Charles gulped. He knew that he was going&nbsp; to be serving on both Sundays and Thursday during the day. Why she said not including summer time was because summer was the only time of the year when the sun never went down before 7 or 8PM. 

In other words, she planned on keeping him as a slave for a long period. She did say �forever�. 

�What was the gulp honey?!� Ivy toying with Charles.

She heard him swallow his own throat, as if he was upset of being her slave 

�Umm nothing�.Ivy.&nbsp; Just something on my throat. That&#8217;s all,� Charles responded in a humble tone.

�God you&#8217;re such a terrible liar you know that.&nbsp; You know what my grandma used to say before she passed away,� Ivy spoke to Charles in the kind of tone that teachers often used sarcastically against their pupils.

�Err no Ivy,� Charles responded in a blurry tone.

�That you should never ever try lying to a gypsy. Do you know why?� Ivy being playful with Charles.

�No I don&#8217;t know why!!� Charles stammered,&nbsp; like some kind of fool. 

�Because we can sniff a liar from a mile away,� Ivy pretending to sound sarcastic.

Ivy then made a face that made her eyes grow wide and menacing. Charles wasn&#8217;t sure if she was just having fun with him or trying to scare him for real. 

She really is a gypsy. She admitted it,&nbsp; Charles thought.

�Hey Charles do you remember the time when Ivy told you that we were witches?� Megan asked in a happy tone.

�No,� Charles lied.

He pretended to sound honest but still remembered Brady reminding him of his childhood. 

�Liar!!&nbsp; I know you know that part. I am sure your friend Brady reminded you of that part. I mean the jerk and his jerk off friends still hate us and even fear us. They hate us because they believe we are witches and believe we have god-like powers.&nbsp; So Charles,&nbsp; please don&#8217;t just sit there and fucking lie to any of our faces. I really hate that. Now I want you to be a good little slave and get us our drinks. What do you girls want?� Ivy asked.

�Same as before,� responded Megan.

�Me too. Get us the same thing� Katherine said.

Ivy took out some British sterling bills and handed them to Charles. 

�Get us three vodkas!� Ivy ordered him.

The whole time Charles was there with them, she had never gave him any money to buy himself a drink. In fact she forbade him to get himself one. 

Charles finally got up the table and walked all the way to the bar counter.&nbsp; Between the table where the three girls were sat down and the bar counter, were three men playing pool on a pool table.&nbsp; One of the guys said something to Charles as he passed them by.

�What&#8217;s the matter boy. You let those three bitches order you around. I guess you must be their new house servant,� were those man&#8217;s words.

Charles never stopped and turned around to have a proper look at any of their faces but he heard all three men laughed at that one man&#8217;s joke. 

Charles guessed that those three guys knew all about Ivy and the other girls&#8217; backgrounds and who they were. He was going to let that guy get away with his insult as he knew he wasn&#8217;t going to be able to take on all three of them.

Charles went to the counter and told the bar lady that he wanted three vodkas. The bar lady was a fat woman in her early 50s; had a round face, blue eyes, a flat nose, curly brown hair, small eyes, and not attractive at all. In fact she looked more like a man than a woman. The lady gave him three glasses of Smirnoff ice (in small drinking glasses of course) and then she said something to him.

�Are you their new slave or something? This is the third time they are sending you to come here and get them their drinks. How come I don&#8217;t see you drinking. Are you scared of them or something? I mean do you work for them? Last time you was here with their proud smirky bitches, you seemed to be having a good time with them and now here you are looking miserable,&nbsp; behaving as if you was their slave or something!!� the bar lady commented.

�Why don&#8217;t you just shut the fuck up and mind your own fucking business!!� Charles snapped.

Charles grabbed all three Smirnoff drinks and walked away.&nbsp; He walked back to Ivy&#8217;s table,&nbsp; placing all three drinks on top of the table.&nbsp; Charles then sat next to Ivy. 

Everyone in this bar knows that I am her slave,&nbsp; Charles thought. 

Charles was worried that if any of these people ever met his mom or friends, they would spill the beans. Then it would be all over for him in this town. He wished they would leave this place.&nbsp; Soon.

�Charles. Why don&#8217;t you be a good city boy and massage my shoulders,� Ivy ordered him,&nbsp; sounding more kinky.

Charles was massaging Ivy&#8217;s shoulders while she and the other girls were drinking and chatting.&nbsp; 

�And don&#8217;t stop until I tell you to,� Ivy said to him.

It seemed like Charles was massaging her shoulders for hours and hours. His arms grew tired. He didn&#8217;t even know what the time was.

Charles&#8217;s heart started beating faster when he spotted the three guys who were just by the pool table,&nbsp; headed by their direction.&nbsp; All three guys passed by their table,&nbsp; with one of them saying something for all of them to hear.

�Hey maybe you should ask your new dog to go lick yer cunts and suck yer tities,� that guy said.

All three of them burst out laughing. 

�Fuck you you creep!!� Megan screamed back at them.

�Let it go Meg. They are not worth our time!� Katherine sighed.

�No matter where we go,&nbsp; people in this town hate us. I mean we pay for our drinks and give them money. Why couldn&#8217;t they just be nicer to us,� cried Megan.

�Because they are assholes Meg. The town will be on their side if we fight them. Our money is not that good enough,� sighed Katherine.

�We will never be accepted in this town. I think I want to go home now!!�&nbsp; Ivy sounding&nbsp; depressed,&nbsp; �Slave you can stop now.&nbsp; We are going home.�




































Chapter 16



Charles and the girls left The Moonshine.&nbsp; By the time they left,&nbsp; it was 11PM. They got on their bicycles and cycled all the way back to the girls&#8217; mansion up on the hill. Once they reached the mansion,&nbsp; Ivy told the girls that she was going to join them later and at the moment wanted to have some privacy in her bedroom.&nbsp; In other words she wanted to be alone with Charles.

When they were inside the mansion,&nbsp; Charles and Ivy were alone inside Ivy&#8217;s bedroom.&nbsp; 

�I want you to follow me!! I don&#8217;t feel too good!!�&nbsp; Ivy ordered Charles.

�Maybe you should drink some water!!�&nbsp; suggested Charles.

Charles could sense that Ivy was upset about the way the rest of the town was viewing her and the other two girls Megan and Katherine. 

�Why don&#8217;t you just shut the fuck up!!�&nbsp; Ivy screamed at him.

Ivy slapped him very hard on the face.

SLAP

Her slap had hurt his face and ego. 

�We are alone now and you forgot to refer to me as Mistress you fucking imbecile.&nbsp; How many times do I have to remind you to call me Mistress when we are alone??�&nbsp; Ivy screamed at him.

She was pulling very hard on his right ear.&nbsp; Charles felt as if his right ear was going to come off.&nbsp; He cried in pain.

�Ouch!!� he cried in pain.

�I&#8217;m sorry Mistress.&nbsp; I was just thinking about your health.&nbsp; Please don&#8217;t be mad at me. You said so yourself that you were not feeling great.&nbsp; All I said was you should drink water!!�&nbsp; Charles cried.

�Never mind Charles.&nbsp; Shut up and walk behind me!!� she ordered him.

�Yes Mistress!� he whimpered and bowed.

Charles trekked behind Ivy.&nbsp; It was like the reverse situation between an Arab&nbsp; Muslim man and his wife or wives. The Arab Muslim women trekked behind their husbands,&nbsp; all dressed up in long black gowns that covered them from head to face, but in this case it was Charles who trekked behind Ivy. 

Her bedroom was as large as some school libraries. He followed her until they reached what looked like a door.&nbsp; Ivy opened that door. It was a bathroom door. Ivy had her own bathroom within her bedroom.&nbsp; Ivy went inside and slammed the door behind her.

SLAM

It was a very loud slam.&nbsp; Charles was afraid that he was going to go deaf.&nbsp; He looked at the time.&nbsp; It was half-past-eleven.&nbsp; Charles lied to his mom that he was spending time with his friends and that they were catching up on old times,&nbsp; explaining why he was going to come late sometimes.&nbsp; His mom didn&#8217;t care,&nbsp; as long as he could get up on his own and get ready to work in her shop.

He heard Ivy making some sounds behind the bathroom door.&nbsp; He heard the water running and the toilet bowl flashing so many times.&nbsp; He heard Ivy throwing up,&nbsp; like a couple of times.&nbsp;&nbsp; There was silence for about two minutes until he heard her sit down on the toilet seat. 

Then she called out to him.

�Charles could you come in here,� Ivy called out to him in a distressed tone.

�Ok.&nbsp; I am coming in,�&nbsp; Charles replied in a certain tone.

He went to the bathroom door and opened it.&nbsp; Her bathroom was larger even than the ones inside hotels.&nbsp; Ivy was sat down on a toilet seat.&nbsp; Her underwear and the short hot pants she wore that night were on the tiled bathroom floor. 

�I just peed Charles.&nbsp; I want to be clean Charles.&nbsp; In fact I don&#8217;t think I have any toilet rolls anymore.&nbsp; I think you should come here and clean me up!��&nbsp; Ivy smiled to him.

Charles saw that beside her were loads of paper bags of toilet rolls. He then looked at her face. One moment she looked sad and the next,&nbsp; she looked wicked. 

�Now come crawl here and lick my pussy clean!� she yelled at him.

�Yes Mistress!� Charles whimpered.

Charles slowly dropped down to all fours and crawled like a dog towards his Mistress.&nbsp; When he finally reached her,&nbsp; she grabbed his short Blond hair and moved his face closer to her pussy.&nbsp; He could smell her urine. 

�Now use that disgusting tongue of yours to clean my pussy!� she ordered him,&nbsp; then shoving his cute face towards her crouch. 

Charles was lapping his tongue way at the disgusting smelly salty taste of where her urine had just come out of.&nbsp; Charles closed his eyes,&nbsp; trying his best t withstand the disgusting unbearable smell. While he was licking her pussy clean,&nbsp; she was just laughing at what she was making him do.

�Oh Charles.&nbsp; This is what your tongue is good for.&nbsp; To clean a gypsy pussy. Your tongue feels so good Charles,�&nbsp; Ivy making erotic sounds.

Charles kept on performing the demeaning task until his Mistress told him to stop. 

�Charles I want you to lay your head down on the toilet!� Ivy ordered him.

Ivy got up from her toilet seat and she raised the upper part of the toilet bowl so that Charles could rest his head on it.&nbsp; It felt very very uncomfortable.&nbsp; It was straining his neck muscle. The rest of his upper body was rested towards the toilet bowl and his lower body seated right up on the tiled bathroom floor.&nbsp; 

Before Charles could blink his leaf-coloured green eyes,&nbsp; Ivy stood over his resting head.&nbsp; Charles could see her ass and pussy looking down on him. 

�Charles open your mouth wide,�&nbsp; Ivy ordered him.

Charles&#8217; heart was beating.&nbsp; He knew what she was going to do to him next. He hated it. He wanted to cry and beg her not to do this to him. He knew it was pointless to beg his Mistress. She didn&#8217;t care for his pride or self-esteem at all. 

Charles opened his mouth. He opened it wide.&nbsp; Really wide. Ivy&#8217;s pussy was just above his face.&nbsp; He could smell some of her urine stains. He knew that he was going to be doing the most disgusting act that has ever been asked of him.&nbsp; 

�I can&#8217;t control it anymore.&nbsp; Keep that mouth of yours open!� she told him in a high-pitched voice.

Ivy&#8217;s piss started raining down her piss down his throat.&nbsp; 

�Ahh.&nbsp; Nature calls,�&nbsp; Ivy joked.

She was using Charles&#8217; mouth as a human toilet bowl. His mouth was taking in more salty-tasting disgusting-smelling yellowish-looking human piss. The piss was shooting down his throat,&nbsp; all the way to his stomach. It was not just an uncomfortable feeling but a strenuous one too.&nbsp; It was straining his neck,&nbsp; being made to lay down on that position. His throat felt like it was being struck by a soft needle. His nose had to put up with a lot of strong salty stench. 

As he continued doing this demeaning disgusting humiliating self-slapping act,&nbsp; he did the only other thing that he could do to try and ease his situation.&nbsp; He closed his eyes.&nbsp; Ivy finally stopped pissing down his mouth and throat.&nbsp; She moved away from him.&nbsp; She then angrily slapped him.

SLAP

Charles instantly opened his eyes. 

�The next time you close your fucking eyelids,&nbsp; I am going to put scotch tape on both your eyes,&nbsp; so that you won&#8217;t be able to close them. Then I am going to tie you up and piss down on both of them.&nbsp; Imagine if I piss down on those beautiful green eyes of yours.&nbsp; They are as green as leaves and did you know that people in cavemen times pissed down on leaves,&nbsp; just because of their colour,�&nbsp; Ivy taunted Charles angrily.

Charles shook his head.&nbsp; This was the scariest threat she had ever made against him. He could hear his heart beat and he was even sweating.&nbsp; Charles gulped. 

�Please don&#8217;t Mistress.&nbsp; Please please please don&#8217;t.&nbsp; I won&#8217;t close them next time.&nbsp; I promise.&nbsp; Please don&#8217;t piss on my eyes!!�&nbsp; Charles begged,&nbsp; shaking his head frantically.

He sounded like a little kid,&nbsp; scared of the boogeyman hiding behind his bedroom closet.

�Charles just shut up. You sound like a little kid you know that. How old are you again?� she asked him in an irritated tone.

�I am seventeen years old Mistress!� he responded in a humbled tone.

�So start acting your age. God if you can only hear the way you sound. I want to lie down on my bed. I want you to lick my pussy while I lie down!� she ordered him.

�Yes Mistress!� he bowed.

Charles followed Ivy all the way to her bed,&nbsp; in the middle of her room.&nbsp; She was laying on her back,&nbsp; while Charles face was buried between her crotch.&nbsp; He was working his tongue on her pussy.&nbsp; She enjoyed it. She started having an orgasm and started cumming towards his face and mouth.&nbsp; She had her right hand,&nbsp; pushing his Blond head towards between her legs. 

�Keep on lapping that tongue of yours, slave,�&nbsp; Ivy moaning sexually.

Charles was licking her until she told him to stop.&nbsp; She then turned around.&nbsp; Her ass was towards her face.

�Slave I want you to lick my asshole.&nbsp; I want you to work your tongue on my ass!� she ordered him.

�Yes Mistress!� Charles responded.

Charles was pressing his pale face on her ass cheeks,&nbsp; lapping his tongue between them.&nbsp; At one point she just farted.&nbsp; On his face.&nbsp; It was a horrible smell. 

�Keep on licking my ass slave!� Ivy told him.

Charles nose had to put up with the strong smell of her fart,&nbsp; while making her ass feel good and pampered at the same time.

By the time Ivy was finished with Charles,&nbsp; it was already 1AM in the morning.&nbsp; 

�You better get back home Charles so that you can wake up tomorrow for work.&nbsp; I am glad I am too rich to work,&nbsp; unlike someone else here I know!� Ivy making fun of Charles.

�I think I will do just that Mistress!� Charles responded,&nbsp; as if he was her waiter.

�I just wish I can cut off that tongue of yours and use it as an ass-comforter� Ivy joked.

Charles gulped at what she had just said. He looked scared.&nbsp; Just the thought of it scared the hell out of him. 

�Mistress??� Charles panicked.

He wasn&#8217;t sure if she was serious or not. She had used him that whole night that whatever she said to him, seemed like she was really going to do those things to him.

�Charles if you remain my Blond obedient male slave,&nbsp; I will be nice to you. Come on. I was just playing with you. You know something. I think you look tired. In fact if I let you cycle all the way back to your house,&nbsp; you are going to collapse. You might even collapse somewhere in the middle of the road. Tell you what. I am going to have my chauffeur send you home. I want my slave to be in good condition. You made me feel good tonight so I am going to lessen your burden tonight� Ivy smiled at him.

When Ivy sounded kind to him, she really did look like an angel. Deep down Charles knew her well enough not to let that fool him. This same angel could become a malicious devil at any moment.





Chapter 17



For the last three weeks every night since his first night as being Ivy&#8217;s slave,&nbsp; Charles had spent them with Ivy and the girls.&nbsp; They normally start the night by spending it on the pubs or the beaches,&nbsp; where Ivy would make him work.&nbsp; He would be bringing them their drinks while they were sat down in the pubs.&nbsp; He would sometimes lay down facing the sandy ground of the beach while Ivy used him as a human chair.&nbsp;&nbsp; At night she had rough sex with him and sued him to do demeaning and disgusting things, like allowing her to piss down his mouth or lick her ass after she had farted.

On Sundays and Thursdays,&nbsp; Ivy used Charles during the day.&nbsp; On&nbsp; those&nbsp; days,&nbsp; the girls would normally be strolling in the woods.&nbsp; Whenever Ivy and the girls would be strolling in the woods,&nbsp; Ivy used Charles as a horse.&nbsp; She sat on his big back while he crawled on all fours. Ivy felt heavy on his back and the palms of his hands were feeling the stinging effects of the natural grounds of the woods.&nbsp; 

Sometimes Ivy would get into arguments with the two other girls. As Ivy did not believe in spitting on the ground, she made Charles opened his mouth and spat inside it. That made Charles feel like a human trash can. He felt being bashed up. Both physically and psychologically. 

Charles hated Sundays and Thursdays more than the other five days as those were the only two days he had to spend far more time with Ivy.&nbsp; Lucky for him, none of his friends or his mom&#8217;s friends ever saw him with those girls. If he had not sworn on his father&#8217;s parents&#8217; graves, he would not have allowed himself to be subjected to this sort of treatment.

Compared to what Ivy put him through,&nbsp; working at his mom&#8217;s shop was far better. Stocking shelves up and serving customers seemed a lot more easier. In a way working in town shops was far better than working in city shops, as in the cities,&nbsp; he would be serving too many customers and his time would always be occupied.

There were moments of times when Charles wanted to dump his cell phone, lie to his mom about how he lost it and break contact with Ivy together. The problem was even if he avoided her, she could come looking for him in his house.&nbsp; 

As for Brady and the rest of the boys, the only time he saw them was when he met them for his break lunch. They wanted him to come out at night but he always had to lie about chatting with his friends from Manchester on the Internet.

It was one fine Tuesday,&nbsp; around twelve at noon.&nbsp; Charles went to meet Brady and the boys at The Crusaders.&nbsp; Charles didn&#8217;t look and feel too good.&nbsp; Ivy had pushed him beyond the limits of his body.&nbsp; She had abused him in any way imaginable. 

�So Charles how about you make yourself free on Friday night. I mean your friends back in the city can understand right. I mean you are spending quality time with your childhood buddies,�&nbsp; Brady was playfully hitting at Charles&#8217;s left arm. 

Charles was sat down with Brady on one end of the table while Pete, Thomas and Alex were sat opposite them.&nbsp; 

�What&#8217;s up on Friday night?� asked Charles.

�We are planning to go to the movies! Green Lantern is coming out! With Ryan fucking Reynolds, the dude who played Deadpool in X Men Origins Wolverine,� cried Pete.

Normally people in small towns don&#8217;t use American (Texan to be specific) terms like dude, but many of the young people nowadays do. 

�He wasn&#8217;t Deadpool in that movie.&nbsp; He was Weapon nine there. He becomes Deadpool in his next movie!� cried Thomas.

The boys were fans of Marvel Comic books. 

�Come on man. You rarely hang out with us at night. I mean we are your best friends mate.&nbsp; I mean if you have a girl,&nbsp; how come you haven&#8217;t told about us about her yet?!�&nbsp; Alex remarked.

Charles&#8217;s heart was beating. Do these guys know about him and Ivy? If he had a girlfriend, that would explain why he couldn&#8217;t hang out with them at night but being his best friends, he should have told them if he was actually seeing someone in town. 

�See. There is no girl in your life yet. Make yourself free this Friday Night. Have you been yet to the cinema here?� asked Brady.

�We only have one cinema in this town!&nbsp; Don&#8217;t tell me you never even been there once?� Alex made an astonishing glare.

�Well actually no I haven&#8217;t,� Charles replied.

Normally he hangs out with Ivy and the girls every night. The truth was he didn&#8217;t want to see her anymore. He didn&#8217;t want to look at his cell phone after 7PM.&nbsp; It was somewhere during that time he checks his message box on his cell phone. Ivy always tells him where to meet her. 

�Then I think you should come with us. It&#8217;ll be fun!�&nbsp; Brady sounding more pushy.

�Well ok sure!!&nbsp; Friday it is!!�&nbsp; Charles gave up.

�Yes!! It&#8217;ll be fun. You get to spend more quality times with us and catch up on more old times,�&nbsp; Pete cried with excitement.

Charles wasn&#8217;t sure if he was going to be able to keep this promise but he didn&#8217;t want to ponder on it. Anything would be better than having to see Ivy. 

After having his break lunch with his friends,&nbsp; Charles went back to his mom&#8217;s shop. Charles worked but during that day, he wasn&#8217;t feeling very well. His head felt heavy as if he was going to develop some sort of migraine. 

By the time it was 7PM, Charles really felt sick. While his mom was finishing up behind the shop counter (something she did before closing the shop), Charles went up to his mom.

�Mom I think I wanna go home!� Charles cried.

�You are going home? You are going to be joining your mom for dinner tonight? What&#8217;s the matter? Normally you hang out with Brady and the guys after work!&nbsp; I take it that you are sick!&nbsp; Well we&#8217;ll put your bike at the trunk. You might as well join me in the car since we are going the same way!� his mom smiled.

His mom still thought that he hang out with Brady and the boys every night.&nbsp; It was a lie he always kept on feeding her. He didn&#8217;t want his mom to know the truth.

Mom meet the girl who abuses your only handsome son every night,&nbsp; Charles sarcastically thought.

�Thanks ma!� Charles sighed.

�You do look sick! Are you ok?� his mom asked in a concerned tone.

�I think I wanna go home and rest mom!�&nbsp; Charles sighed.

�Well I&#8217;ll fix you up with some chicken soup tonight!&nbsp; That would be better for you!&nbsp; Perhaps you should get tot bed early tonight,� his mom suggested.

�I think so too mom� Charles nodded.

He was going home with his mom. He couldn&#8217;t be bothered to check his Mistress&#8217;s text message. His mind was tired and exhausted.&nbsp;&nbsp; Tonight he was not going to see Ivy.





&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *********

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

It was 11PM at night.&nbsp; Charles was resting in his bedroom.&nbsp; The lights were turned off. The bedroom window was open so that fresh air could seep through.&nbsp; The sun had finally set by 10PM but it was still pretty warm inside his bedroom.&nbsp; Charles was resting with only his underwear on. 

As Charles was resting with his eyes closed and his head laying on the pillow,&nbsp; he heard his cell phone ringing.&nbsp; He didn&#8217;t want to answer it but if he didn&#8217;t,&nbsp; it would be ringing the whole night and he would never be able to get a full rest or sleep.&nbsp;&nbsp; Charles quickly reached for his cell phone as it lay on top of his bedside table and picked it up.&nbsp; He saw whose name it was: Ivy. 

Charles couldn&#8217;t be bothered to talk to her or to explain to her why he didn&#8217;t meet up with her tonight. He was sick. Really sick. He thought of shutting his cell phone but she would know if he did, as the cell phone operating voice would say that his phone could not be reached.&nbsp; He just played with his cell phone,&nbsp; putting it to silent. Once it was &#8216;silent&#8217;,&nbsp; he put it back on the bedside table and went back to rest.

I better not show up to work tomorrow.&nbsp; If she comes to look for me at work and I&#8217;m not there, she should be able to understand that I must be sick and resting at home,&nbsp; Charles thought.























Chapter 18



On Wednesday,&nbsp; Charles had spent the entire day at home.&nbsp; His mom told him to stay at home and not to go out. He did not leave his house.&nbsp; He was watching the television the whole day,&nbsp; eating cereals in bowls,&nbsp; with milk poured over them.&nbsp; Charles enjoyed cereal since he was a little boy.&nbsp; 

By the time it was 2PM in the afternoon,&nbsp; Charles had gone back to his bedroom.&nbsp; He wanted to go online in his PC.&nbsp; He picked up his cell phone,&nbsp; curious if Ivy had sent him any text messages as he did not respond to her phone call yesterday or her text message last night. He checked the screen. He had&nbsp; five unread messages.&nbsp; All of them from Ivy.&nbsp; 

I better read them and respond before she does something I am going to regret,&nbsp; Charles thought.

A part of him was already in panic mode,&nbsp; despite the fact that he still wasn&#8217;t feeling well. Before he could open up the first one,&nbsp; he heard his door bell ringing.

DING DONG

I have a guest,&nbsp; Charles thought. 

His heart was pounding.&nbsp; Maybe it was Ivy,&nbsp; outside his front door. Charles gulped.&nbsp; 

Oh no. She has taken the battle to my doorstep,&nbsp; Charles panicked. 

Charles waited inside his bedroom.&nbsp; He thought of not going downstairs and checking who it was. There was a window next to his front door and if he went out to peek through,&nbsp; the person at the door would see him.&nbsp; It would be worst if it was Ivy as she would demand he let her in his house. 

After three minutes of the bell ringing and the door knocking,&nbsp; the noises by the door stopped.&nbsp; Charles sighed.&nbsp; Then all of a sudden his cell phone was buzzing.&nbsp; He had an incoming call.&nbsp; It was from Thomas.&nbsp; Charles quickly answered it. 

�Hi what&#8217;s up?� Charles asked.

�Charles are you at home? Your mom said that you were sick. I thought of stopping by to see how you were doing,� Thomas said.

�Oh you were the one ringing the doorbell earlier. Alright I am coming down now and I am gonna let you in. Bye!�&nbsp; Charles hung up.

Charles decided he was going to check Ivy&#8217;s text messages later.&nbsp; When he was alone.&nbsp; All alone. 

Charles let Thomas through the front door and the two boys spent the whole day at the dining hall. They sat down at the dining table while eating and drinking. Thomas made them sliced ham sandwiches with mayonnaise and cucumber in them. As for drinks, it was orange juice and tea. 

�So Charles you still joining us Friday night for Green Lantern?!�&nbsp; Thomas asked and spoke.

�Yeah I guess so. I mean I need to spend more time with you guys and I need to chill out,�&nbsp; Charles smiled.

Charles enjoyed Thomas&#8217;s company.&nbsp; Thomas was such a&nbsp; good friend,&nbsp; coming all the way to his house to check up on him.&nbsp; Charles picked up his orange juice drink and sipped from it. 

�Charles out of curiosity, what is it that you really do in the evening??�&nbsp; asked Thomas.

This was a question Charles dreaded. 

�Well I told you guys before. I go online and chat with my school friends from Manchester. Sometimes I play video games,�&nbsp; Charles responded.

Charles realized that he had just sounded a bit irritated. A bad move indeed. 

�Well just wanted to let you know that at some nights, the rest of hang out together. Sometimes we spend the night at Brady&#8217;s,&nbsp; watching horror flicks or even telling ghost stories. You should come and join us.&nbsp; My goodness. Seven years ago you were the gang leader. Now you are behaving more like Wolverine than like Cyclops. If you had remained in town for the last seven years, it would be us spending the night here,&nbsp; watching horror flicks at your lounge every Friday or Saturday night,�&nbsp; Thomas commented.

Wolverine and Cyclops were comic book characters from a comic book series titled Uncanny X Men. Wolverine was the loner who sometimes played with the team and Cyclops was the team leader. 

�Charles.&nbsp; Buddy.&nbsp; Level with me man.&nbsp; Are you seeing some bird behind our backs?� Thomas asked.

Charles could see that Thomas suspected something.&nbsp; He was asking himself why was Charles always so busy nearly every night? 

�I&nbsp; don&#8217;t have a girlfriend, if that is what you are asking!�&nbsp; Charles responded trying not to be irritated.

�So I take it that you are trying to cover something up?&nbsp; To protect us and your mom!�&nbsp; commented Thomas.

My God. Why the hell is he doing this? God he is fucking good. He really does suspect something wrong. Does he know? Does he know about me and Ivy?&nbsp; Charles asked himself.

�I�.I am not sure if I follow you,�&nbsp; Charles pretending to play dumb.

Maybe Thomas, and even the other guys, knew about him seeing Ivy and that they are playing dumb and having fun with him.&nbsp; They did discourage him from seeing her again. They still will,&nbsp; if they knew he was still seeing her.

�I know your secret Charles!!�&nbsp; Thomas sounded serious.

�You�you do?!�&nbsp; Charles sounding calm.

�You&#8217;re a werewolf. You change every night. No one knows. Not even your mom. This is why we don&#8217;t see you,� Thomas sounded serious.

Thomas broke out into immature laughter.

�My God. You are such a twat at times you know that!� Charles cried,&nbsp; shaking his head in disapproval. 

Charles joined his friend in the laughter. 

�Just joking man.&nbsp; Just joking,�&nbsp; Thomas laughed. 

Charles grabbed a sliced ham sandwich, opened his mouth and bit off a chunk of it.&nbsp; The taste of toasted wheat, mayonnaise and ham felt nice in his mouth. It tasted very good. 

�Hey Charles there is something I got to tell you!�&nbsp; Thomas remarked.

�Tell me?&nbsp; About what??�&nbsp; Charles was curious.

�It&#8217;s about Ivy!!�&nbsp; Thomas spoke in a dead serious tone.

�Ivy???&nbsp; What about Ivy??�&nbsp; Charles asked.

Charles was now certain that the gang did know about him and Ivy. 

�You look like you have seen a ghost??&nbsp; Are you alright?� asked Thomas.

�Oh. I am fine.&nbsp; Carry on.&nbsp; What about Ivy??� asked Charles.

�I said Ivy and you look scared.&nbsp; I take it that you don&#8217;t see her anymore,&nbsp; since we told you about her weeks ago.&nbsp; You know, when you had the party here on one Saturday,�&nbsp; Thomas spoke.

�Oh yeah. You guys told me she is bad news,&nbsp; what about her anyways?� asked Charles.

�Well I take it that she does not know who you really are.&nbsp; If she did,&nbsp; she would be harassing you and giving you shit and hell.&nbsp; Just to let you know that there are certain places in Constantinople&#8217;s Lot that you should avoid!!�&nbsp; Thomas commented.

Thomas named the Moonshine and some other pubs that he and Ivy went to, as places he should avoid.&nbsp; Thomas said that Ivy and the girls were known to sometimes go there. 

�Thanks for the tips man!! Really appreciate them!� Charles sounded grateful.

�Hey Charles,&nbsp; how about we go over to your lounge and watch some films! Do you have any DVDs or Blue Ray discs?� asked Thomas.

The two boys went to the lounge and watched some of Charles Blue-Ray disc movie collection.&nbsp; They watched two action films until Charles&#8217; mom came home.&nbsp; That was the moment Thomas said he better get back home. 

When Charles saw Thomas to the door,&nbsp; he asked Thomas one last thing.

�Thomas if Ivy knew where I live,&nbsp; how bad could that be for me?� Charles asked.

Charles sounded worried,&nbsp; perhaps even afraid. 

�That can be really bad,&nbsp; but that is because she hates your guts. It is best that she never knows where you live because if she does, she is going to cause you a lot of problems!!�&nbsp; Thomas&nbsp; replied. 













Chapter 19



Charles had dinner with his mom that night.&nbsp; She cooked him roast chicken with sliced potatoes, beans, and made him mushroom soup. They were dining at the dining hall.

�Mom can I go out on Friday night with the guys? The guys are planning to go watch a film at the Theatres,�&nbsp; Charles said.

�Of course you can hun. So you are all going to go to the cinema huh. I have never been to the cinema here. You ever been there yet?� she asked him.

�Well this is my first time. We are going to go catch Green Lantern!� replied Charles.

�Hey Charles this Saturday we are going over to your gramps. We are going to spend the night there. Your grandparents will be happy to see you and I am sure by then you are going to be much better,� his mom said.

�I take it that work was exciting today!�&nbsp; Charles making a comment.

�Well honey we are in a small town. Things go very slow here. If we had this shop back in Manchester, we would be overworked. I won&#8217;t have time to read any of my novels in my kindle,� his mom said.

After dinner,&nbsp; Charles retreated to his bedroom.&nbsp;&nbsp; He went online,&nbsp; chatting to his friends back in Manchester. His mom told him not to stay up too late and that he should get an early rest. The truth was that Charles wanted to get his mind of Ivy. He was worried that Ivy could be showing up at his doorstep. It was too late for Thomas&#8217;s warning. Ivy already knew where he lived. 

Charles then remembered to check Ivy&#8217;s text messages. He hadn&#8217;t read any of them yet but decided he better. He picked up his cell phone and looked.&nbsp; His heart was beating.&nbsp; Before Thomas came,&nbsp; he only had 5 unread messages.&nbsp; Now it was 8.&nbsp; All 8 unread messages.&nbsp; All of them, were Ivy&#8217;s. 

I better read and respond,&nbsp; Charles thought. 

Charles read all 8 messages

First message:

Meet me outside Moonshine

Second message:

Where the fuck r u? I have been here over an hour and you haven&#8217;t showed up yet?

Third message:

You stood me up you asshole

Fourth message:

I called your phone. Better call me back. U have no fucking idea how mad I am at u. No one stands me up. No one. Especially not someone who is my fucking property.

Fifth message:

U r dead. U r going to regret having messed with me

Sixth message:

I know where u live and where u work? U don&#8217;t want 2 mess with me Charles. 

Seventh message:

I am going to give u 1 last chance. Call me back or u r going to regret it. U don&#8217;t want me 2 b your enemy. Trust me on that 1.

Eight message:

U r dead Charles. I am going to go tell your mom the truth about us. She is going to know that her only son vowed to be my slave. The town is going to know the things we have been doing together. U r not going to live through this. U will be discarded and laughed at and humiliated.

Charles gulped.

She is going to destroy me. She is going to ruin my reputation here in Constantinople&#8217;s Lot,&nbsp; Charles panicked.

Charles text her back:

Sorry that I was not responding. I have been sick for two days. I was home the whole time.&nbsp; I&nbsp; didn&#8217;t even show up 4 work. Plz don&#8217;t be mad. 

When Charles finished sending her that text message,&nbsp; he placed his cell phone down the bedroom table.&nbsp; He turned off the bedroom lights and called it a night. He was resting on his bed. 

Five minutes later,&nbsp; he heard a buzz on his cell phone. He picked it up. He had a message. From Ivy. He read it:

I&#8217;m sorry 2 hear that Charles L. I didn&#8217;t know u were sick. Sorry about the way I talked 2 u. Let me make it up 2 u. I will come over 2 your place tomorrow at noon and cook u food and help take care of u. I will be your mommy when your mum is not around to be there 4 u. Let me nurse u.&nbsp; Hugs and love from Ivy

Charles wasn&#8217;t sure if she was being sincere or playing a game with him. Maybe she really did fell guilty and bad for him and how he was feeling? Perhaps she blamed herself for the way she had been treating him and if not for that, he wouldn&#8217;t be sick now. 

Charles also didn&#8217;t want her coming over to his house,&nbsp; even if she really was genuinely going to take care of him.&nbsp;&nbsp; She scared the hell out of him,&nbsp; especially the way she abused him as her personal slave. She made feel like a slave in her own place and her presence in his place, would give him the feeling that he wasn&#8217;t safe from her even in his own home.

Charles replied to her:

That&#8217;s ok J I will call u back when I get better. I prefer 2 b alone right now. Thank u 4 caring and offering. Got 2 go and rest now. C u

Charles placed his cell phone on his bedside table.&nbsp; He was glad of the way he chose his words with Ivy,&nbsp; so that she didn&#8217;t do anything like come over to his house.&nbsp; Charles went back to bed. 

Charles dozed off. He dreamt that Ivy came over to his place and that they hung out in his lounge. That dream turned into a nightmare when she started bossing him around and taunting him. 

















Chapter 20




Thursday Afternoon



It was 1PM in the afternoon.&nbsp; Charles was watching television in the lounge.&nbsp; He felt only a little bit better compared to yesterday.&nbsp; Normally he had the Thursday off but still worked on Fridays for his mom. He wasn&#8217;t sure if he was going to work tomorrow.&nbsp; Charles picked up his cup of tea from the table next to that sofa he was laying on,&nbsp; and sipped from it.&nbsp; 

Then he heard the door bell ringing.&nbsp; 

DING DONG

It must be Thomas. He came to see how I am doing,&nbsp; Charles thought.

Charles got up from the sofa,&nbsp; slowly walking towards the front door. He wore nothing but his short white pants. Summer wasn&#8217;t over yet but it wasn&#8217;t September yet either. Charles reached the front door.&nbsp; Should he go peek through the window next to the front door.&nbsp; He decided he didn&#8217;t have to.&nbsp; It was probably just Thomas paying him a visit and checking up on his friend&#8217;s health.

Charles opened the front door.&nbsp; When he saw who it was.&nbsp; His heart was beating a little bit quicker. 

�Aren&#8217;t you going to let me in!?�&nbsp; Ivy asked,&nbsp; while standing outside the front door. 

Ivy was dressed up in a nice pink shirt and pink mini-skirt. Her hair was tied up in a pony-tail.

�Oh hi!!&nbsp; This is a surprise,�&nbsp; Charles cried.

Charles still really didn&#8217;t feel that good.&nbsp; Ivy&#8217;s presence was going to make him ever more sicker today than he ever was for the last two days and nights. 

�You look like a wreck,�&nbsp; Ivy commented.

Ivy looked emotional,&nbsp; as if she was upset for Charles&#8217;s current state of appearance.

�Yeah I&#8217;m still not feeling very well,�&nbsp; Charles replied in a weak tone.

Please go away,&nbsp; Charles was wishfully thinking.

Before Charles could say another word or blink his eyes,&nbsp; Ivy quickly pulled him over to her and she gave him a strong hug. She then let go.

�I am so upset that you are sick.&nbsp; May I come in?� she asked him politely.

�Well I kinda wanted to be alone right now and mom said I shouldn&#8217;t have people over since she thinks it would slow down my&nbsp; recovery.&nbsp; I&#8217;m sure you understand,�&nbsp; Charles responded in a �I-am-sick� tone.

Ivy looked at him,&nbsp; still looking upset. 

�Well look.&nbsp; I am going to go now but if you need anything,&nbsp; just ring me yeah. You have my number,�&nbsp; Ivy sounding concerned.

�I&#8217;ll call you.&nbsp; Thanks for coming to see me,�&nbsp; he said.

�Hey what are friends for!!�&nbsp; Ivy smiled.

You still came to see me even when it old you not to. And&nbsp; I didn&#8217;t know that I was your friend?&nbsp; I thought I was just a slave to you!&nbsp; Charles sarcastically thought.

Ivy walked away from the doorstep and he closed the front door behind him. He was hoping that none of his other friends were around to see her paying him a visit. 

Charles spent the rest of the day watching television or watching youtube videos online. By 5PM he took a nap and woke up when his mom came back home from work,&nbsp; which was somewhere around 7-ish. His mom made them dinner. 

Tomorrow night,&nbsp; he was going to be with his friends,&nbsp; watching Green Lantern the movie at the local town cinema.














Chapter 21




Friday Night



Charles and the rest of the guys were inside one of the theatres,&nbsp; watching Green Lantern the movie.&nbsp; The cinema had only two theatre rooms.&nbsp; While this room was showing Green Lantern the movie,&nbsp; the other one was playing the eight Harry Potter movie,&nbsp; which was actually the second part to the seventh movie of that franchise: Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2. 

All five teenage boys were glued to the large cinema screen.&nbsp; Each boy had a bag of popcorns and large coca cola drink.&nbsp; It was a long movie.&nbsp; When the movie was over,&nbsp; all five boys were talking about the film.&nbsp; They walked towards the car park where Brady&#8217;s car was parked.&nbsp; Brady had a Ford (actually it&#8217;s his parents). As soon as all five boys reached Brady&#8217;s car,&nbsp; Brady called out to Charles.

�Hey Charles come sit up at the front with me.&nbsp; The rest of you sit at the back!2&nbsp; Brady telling Pete, Alex and Thomas.

Brady opened the driver&#8217;s seat with his car key.&nbsp; He got inside the driver&#8217;s seat,&nbsp; and then moved all the door locks up so that the other guys can come inside.&nbsp; Charles came and sat next to Brady. The other three sat in the back.

�Hey Charles. The rest of the guys are planning to spend the night at my place. Come and join us!�&nbsp; suggested Brady.

�Come on man. It&#8217;ll be fun!�&nbsp; Pete said.

�Oh alright!!&nbsp; I&#8217;ll just call my mom and tell her!�&nbsp; Charles said.

Charles took out his cell phone, rang his mom&#8217;s number and told her that he would be spending the night at Brady&#8217;s.&nbsp; Sara was ok with it,&nbsp;&nbsp; as she thought that he needed to be out of the house as he had been cooked up inside the house the whole week (since he was sick).

Brady first drove them all to a diner, where everyone got off and dined for a while.&nbsp; The boys seated themselves on some corner,&nbsp; ordering cheeseburgers, fries and colas. They spent the whole time talking about films, the movies and everyone asked Charles more about what his &#8216;city-life&#8217; was like.&nbsp; Normally that was a conversation Charles often talked about when they normally met up during their lunch breaks.

After the diner,&nbsp; they all drove back to Brady&#8217;s.&nbsp; Brady parked the Ford at the driveway and they all followed him to the front doorstep.&nbsp; He took out his house key set and let them inside. Brady&#8217;s parents often let him have friends coming over to his place for Friday Night sleepovers. 

This wasn&#8217;t the first time Charles had been to Brady&#8217;s place. He had been here but only a few times.&nbsp; Brady&#8217;s house was large, though not as large as Charles&#8217;s.&nbsp; Brady had two younger sisters who had their own separate rooms and his mom and dad shared the same master bedroom. The guys would all sleep inside Brady&#8217;s bedroom and he had lots of pump-up beds for his guests. 

The boys were watching horror films inside Brady&#8217;s bedroom,&nbsp; eating crisps and drinking from a bottle of cola.&nbsp; The first horror film they all watched was Drag Me To Hell,&nbsp; which was about an old gypsy cursing a young Blonde bank secretary for not allowing her to keep her home. The poor Blonde protagonist has three days left before demons would drag her to hell. The second, and last, horror film they watched was Stephen Kings&#8217; Thinner,&nbsp; which was also about gypsy curses. 

The whole time Charles was watching both movies,&nbsp; it made him think about Ivy, as she was the first thing that came to his mind when he thought of gypsies.&nbsp; She said so herself that she was a gypsy.&nbsp; Charles wanted to protest the boys&#8217; choice of films but if he did, he knew they would suspect something. 

In both films, the gypsy protagonists were harassing, taunting and haunting the films&#8217; protagonists. Thinner was a lot worse than Drag Me To Hell, as the gypsy curse didn&#8217;t kill the protagonist within three days but gave him two weeks to die,&nbsp; very slowly and in a humiliating way. Thinner was about a fat lawyer who ran an old gypsy over and as a result,&nbsp; her husband cursed him that he would be getting thinner and thinner until he finally died. 

In both films, the protagonists had nightmares about their gypsy antagonists.&nbsp; Both films also had more than&nbsp; just one that one gypsy antagonist for the protagonists to deal with. They also had to deal with gypsy antagonists&#8217; entire family too. Both films also had two young beautiful gypsy women. In both films, both the young gypsy women were the granddaughters of the antagonists. Both women behaved&nbsp; a lot like Ivy,&nbsp; and that scared the hell out of Charles.&nbsp; The films reminded him even more of Ivy,&nbsp; especially those two different granddaughters. They were arrogant, tough, intimidating, aggressive, bitchy, rude, and seemed very proud of being gypsies.

When Thinner was finally over,&nbsp; everyone was tired and called it a night.&nbsp; Charles slept on a&nbsp; pump-up bed laid down on Brady&#8217;s bedroom floor,&nbsp; just next to Thomas. 

�Night everyone!�&nbsp; Brady yawned,&nbsp; from his bed. 

Charles and the other three boys said their �good nights�. Charles had a hard time sleeping. He was just there staring directly at the ceiling,&nbsp; even with the lights out. The two films were making him think about Ivy.&nbsp; 

Must think happy thoughts Charles.&nbsp; Don&#8217;t let her and the movies get to you,&nbsp; Charles tried telling himself.

Charles was thinking about the good times he had with his friends back at Manchester.&nbsp; He thought more and more of his happy days for the last two years when he was living in Manchester.&nbsp; After an hour,&nbsp; Charles eventually fell asleep. 

While Charles was deep in his sleep,&nbsp; his mind wandered off to dreamland.&nbsp; He had a good dream about riding on a roller coaster.&nbsp; He was inside the car-ride and it was moving up, down and forward.&nbsp; And very very fast, as he last remembered it.&nbsp; It was when his ride went through the dark tunnel that it stopped being a dream,&nbsp; and then changed into a nightmare.

In his nightmare,&nbsp; he was running in the middle of the road,&nbsp; in the middle of nowhere.&nbsp; It was night and the only source of light was from the full moon shining down upon him.&nbsp; Wherever he ran,&nbsp; he always saw Ivy.&nbsp; She was always standing,&nbsp; with her arms on her chest and smiling wickedly.&nbsp; 

�You will never escape me Charles.&nbsp; You are my slave. Forever and ever,�&nbsp; she would taunt him in a haunting tone.

As he kept on running, he heard Ivy calling out to him.&nbsp; From the air.&nbsp; He turned to look up and to his horror, he saw Ivy flying after him on air.&nbsp; Her brown hair was wild and entangled and the wind was blowing through her.&nbsp; Her eyes were wicked. She was baring her teeth,&nbsp; which slowly turned to vampire fangs. 

�I am coming after you Charles. You are mine,� Ivy would hiss demonically towards him.

This really scared the hell out of Charles so badly that he wanted to wake up.&nbsp; He started screaming like a little kid.

�Get away from me!! Get away from me!!�&nbsp; he cried out loud.


The next thing Charles felt was a tight slap on his face

SLAP

�Charles wake up,�&nbsp; a distant voice was calling out to him.

Charles woke up.&nbsp; He was sweating.&nbsp; He found himself once more in Brady&#8217;s bedroom.&nbsp; The lights were turned on.&nbsp; Brady, Pete and Alex were stood up,&nbsp; looking annoyed.&nbsp; Thomas was crouched down next to Charles.

�I had to wake you up.&nbsp; You were screaming really loud.&nbsp; Are you alright??�&nbsp; Thomas was comforting him.

�That must be some nightmare Charles,�&nbsp; Alex said in a semi-sarcastic way.

Brady hit Alex on his right arm,&nbsp; giving him an annoyed glare.

�Would you want something to drink buddy?&nbsp; I can make you a hot drink!&nbsp; How does sound hot chocolate sound?� asked Brady.

They all looked concerned.&nbsp; Alex too but he still had that look of sarcasm in his face.&nbsp; Charles was sure that Alex was annoyed.&nbsp; Charles must have woken up him while he was having a good dream. 

�You are safe buddy.&nbsp; It was just a dream!!�&nbsp; Pete behaving like a good friend.

�We are all here for you man!!�&nbsp; Thomas comforting Charles,&nbsp; patting his back.

Charles looked all around him.&nbsp; He was inside Brady&#8217;s bedroom.&nbsp; He felt a bit guilty for having that nightmare,&nbsp; since his screaming and crying woke everyone up. 

�Yeah I think that hot chocolate sounds good right now.&nbsp; I think I can use that right now!�&nbsp; Charles accepting Brady&#8217;s offer.

�Hey Brady,&nbsp; I can also use hot chocolate right now!�&nbsp; Thomas smiled.

�Me too!�&nbsp; Pete smiling at Brady.

�Alright everyone. How about we all go downstairs to the kitchen and I will make us all hot chocolate!!�&nbsp; Brady feeling generous.

�And while you are making us all hot chocolate,&nbsp; perhaps Charles would share with us what his nightmare was all about!!�&nbsp; Alex being nosy.

�Alex?�&nbsp; Pete giving him an irritated glare.

Brady hitting Alex on the right arm once more. 

�Would you like to talk about it?� Thomas asked in a concerned tone.

�You will feel much better if you talk about it!!&nbsp; Trust me!!�&nbsp; Alex suggested.

Alex looked at both Brady and Pete,&nbsp; giving them the �I did nothing wrong� look. 

�Yeah I will tell you guys what I dreamt about but let&#8217;s go downstairs first!!�&nbsp; Charles suggested.

He was going to lie about his nightmare.&nbsp; He was going to leave Ivy out of it. He also had to think how he was going to avoid her too, as he could not stand the sight of her anymore.&nbsp; She scared the hell out of him,&nbsp; causing him to see her more like some supernatural being rather than a normal ordinary harmless person. 









































Chapter 22




It was the week after Charles was sick and had followed the guys to the cinema to watch Green Lantern the movie. Charles never called or sent Ivy any text messages.&nbsp; He had never seen her in town. He just tried not to think about her.&nbsp; He only prayed that she would go away and leave him alone. Charles thought that maybe Ivy decided to leave him alone out of guilt. If it had not been for her, he wouldn&#8217;t have ended up sick.&nbsp;&nbsp; Charles had worked for his mom the entire week,&nbsp; including Thursday. 

Three more weeks had gone by and he still hadn&#8217;t bumped into Ivy. By then it was already somewhere around Autumn,&nbsp; in the middle of September.&nbsp; The sun no longer went down by 10PM, but by 9PM or even before that time. 

A week came where his mom (Sara) got sick and Charles had to be the one to run the shop. He ran the shop all by himself while his mom stayed at home. It was like an adventure for Charles, having the responsibility of proving to his mom that he was a young adult whom&nbsp; she could delegate responsibility to.&nbsp; His mom gave him the keys to the shop and he already knew how to run it,&nbsp; in her absence. He also drove to work in his mom&#8217;s car, as he knew how to drive.&nbsp; Sometimes while at work, he would call his mom back at home to see if she needed him to bring anything back home or if she wanted him to go to the grocery to get something in particular. 

On that Friday of that same week,&nbsp; just before he was about to close the shop,&nbsp; his mom called his cell phone number.&nbsp; She asked him to buy them some takeaway.&nbsp; It was for dinner.&nbsp; His mom asked if he could go to one of the diners and buy them a large family menu set,&nbsp; consisting of a large bucket of chicken pieces (wings, breasts and drumsticks),&nbsp; bags of fries and a bottle of cola.&nbsp; Charles did what his mom asked but it surprised him why she wanted him to buy a large family type set menu for dinner.&nbsp; Charles asked the diner lady for what his mom asked plus two cheeseburgers, as he was a tall overgrown young man with a large appetite. 

Are we having guests at the house?&nbsp; Charles asked himself while waiting for his order at that diner&#8217;s counter.&nbsp; Once the diner lady came with his order,&nbsp; he happily paid for it. The lady handed to him in a large plastic bag. He took it and left.

When Charles went back to his car,&nbsp; he place the plastic bag with all the food inside at the back seat.&nbsp; He then got into the driver&#8217;s seat and started driving back towards his place. As he drove he thought about why his mom made such a large order.&nbsp; She never said if they were having any guests but only that once he got the food, he should drive home straightaway.

Charles was driving the car,&nbsp; controlling the steering wheel and his foot at the brakes.&nbsp; His eyes were focused on the road.&nbsp; He finally reached the driveway of his house.&nbsp; He parked the car at the driveway,&nbsp; getting off with the food he had bought. He then rang the door bell.

DING DONG

Charles waited until his mom opened the front door.&nbsp; Sara smiled at him.&nbsp; Sara ushered him to walk through the front doorway. 

�Honey can you bring all this to the dining table.&nbsp; I will bring out the plates,�&nbsp; Sara said.

Charles walked through the front door and was standing at the front hallway. 

�We have a guest hun,�&nbsp; his mom whispered to his ear.

�That sounds cool!�&nbsp; Charles replied 

Charles did as his mom asked.&nbsp; He went straight to the dining hall,&nbsp; placing the plastic bag with their food at the dining hall table.&nbsp; His mom then arrived,&nbsp; carrying&nbsp; a pile of plates while her armpit was tugging hard at the food mats. 

�Honey could you go to the kitchen and grab the glasses.&nbsp; I will tell our guest that dinner is ready!� his mom telling him what to do.

�Ok mom,�&nbsp; Charles obeyed. 

When Charles went to the kitchen,&nbsp; he was wondering who this guest was and why his mom never said who it was. Charles grabbed the glasses from the cupboard and then walked back to the dining table.&nbsp; Sara was arranging the food mats and took out the bucket with the chicken wings and drumsticks and laid out the bags with the fries in them.&nbsp; The plates were still piled up,&nbsp; as it was every eating person to themselves to take the plate and choose where they want to sit down.&nbsp; The dining table was big enough for more than twelve persons. 

�So honey why don&#8217;t you just grab yourself a seat. I think I will sit at here!� Sara choosing the head of the table,&nbsp; to sit down and eat,&nbsp; �Ok dear.&nbsp; You can come in now.�

Charles came and sat down on a spot much further away from where the head of the table was,&nbsp; since he liked his space. 

Ten seconds later,&nbsp; their guest came and joined them at the dining hall. Charles saw who it was.&nbsp; His heart was beating much faster and his eyes shot up much wider.

�Hi Charles.&nbsp; I haven&#8217;t seen you in a while,�&nbsp; Ivy responded with a smile.

�Surprise honey. It&#8217;s your old friend from school here.&nbsp; It&#8217;s Eva!�&nbsp; his mom smiling and crying loud with joy and excitement.

�Mind if I sit opposite you Charles!�&nbsp; Ivy smiling.

�Oh no Eva.&nbsp; Not at all.&nbsp; Please do.&nbsp; It&#8217;s good for you to join us here,�&nbsp; Charles responded.

�You see honey. All your old friends from want to have the chance to meet you.&nbsp; It was too bad that she didn&#8217;t make it for our reunion party here during the summer!�&nbsp; his mom commented.
 
His mom had ever never met Ivy,&nbsp; let alone knew the full name and detail of the girl he once bullied before leaving town. Ivy lied to his mom,&nbsp; but only about being a student and an old classmate of his at junior primary school. As for the name she chose to call herself right now,&nbsp; Eva was more or less the original name for the name Ivy, the way William was for Bill.&nbsp; 

�She showed up here this afternoon,&nbsp; looking for you. I told her to stay for dinner and that we&#8217;d surprise you by her sudden visit,� his mom chuckled,&nbsp; as if she was making a match in heaven.

Ivy just looked at Charles.&nbsp; First she was smiling but as they both knew that his mom was not feeling too well and wasn&#8217;t really observing the true chemistry between the two of them,&nbsp; her blue eyes then became wicked. 

�Ok you guys.&nbsp; Dig in,�&nbsp; his mom sounded hungry.

Charles grabbed both of his cheeseburgers with excitement until his mom scolded him.

�Charles Greene, haven&#8217;t you forgotten something!� his mom cried.

�What??� Charles was puzzled.

�You have a guest here!&nbsp; Aren&#8217;t you going to give her your other cheeseburger? I mean I know you got those two for yourself originally but aren&#8217;t you forgetting about being a gentleman. Your old school friend is here. Aren&#8217;t you going to offer her the other cheeseburger!!�&nbsp; his mom lectured.

�Oh yes of course. I can be dumb at times.&nbsp; Here Ive�er�Eva, have my other cheeseburger!�&nbsp; Charles genuinely handing the second cheeseburger to Ivy.

Ivy happily took it.

�Thank you Charlie�&nbsp; Ivy smiling at him.

The way she smiled at him seemed that she was pretending to be grateful.&nbsp; She was being both playful and sarcastic with Charles but fully fooling his mom. 

�I don&#8217;t know what kind of boy I raised. Has&nbsp; he ever taken you out on a date? Well if he hasn&#8217;t,&nbsp; I think he should. I mean you were kind enough to pay him a visit when he was out sick for a few days.&nbsp; I take it that boy Thomas must have told you back as I told him not to talk to anyone and that he should get some rest.&nbsp; That boy Thomas even told me he was going to come and visit him at the house,�&nbsp; Sara was getting carried away.

�Well I did offer to nurse him but he insisted that he can take care of himself!� Ivy shooting Charles a sharp kinky look.

Charles took a bite out of his cheeseburger. Ivy took a bite out of her cheeseburger too,&nbsp; purposely giving Charles her mischievous glare.

�It&#8217;s just so good to see you again Charles!�&nbsp; Ivy smiled at him.

She smiled at him.&nbsp; Wickedly and mischievously. 





























Chapter 23




While they were eating and drinking,&nbsp; Sara was happily telling Ivy what their city life was like,&nbsp; telling even some of Charles&#8217;s personal details to her.&nbsp; 

I am going to be sick,&nbsp; Charles told himself. 

When everyone finished eating,&nbsp; his mom looked at him and also at Ivy.

�Dear why don&#8217;t you and Eva go the lounge and put on a film. We have some Blue Ray disc movies. Hey Eva, do you like Twilight? I got all three movies in blue-ray. I have the first film Twilight. I have the second film new Moon and the third one Eclipse!�&nbsp; Sara was insisting.

�To be honest��&nbsp; Ivy hesitated as she didn&#8217;t know what to call Sara.

�Just call me by my name Sara. I insist dear!!�&nbsp; Sara being too cozy. 

�Well to be honest Sara,&nbsp; I never even read the book series and I am not sure what the craze was about!!�&nbsp; Ivy being friendly with Sara.

�Hey tell you what dear.&nbsp; Why don&#8217;t you spend the night here? We have&nbsp; lots of rooms. The three of us can spend the entire night watching the Twilight movies. Io think we should all go watch it so that you know what you are missing!!�&nbsp; Sara becoming too pushy.

Unfortunately for Charles,&nbsp; his mom Sara was a Twilight fan-atic.&nbsp; The novel-film series had lots and lots of fan-atics,&nbsp; mostly females of all ages. Like most guys his age worldwide, he hated the novels, the film series and the actor who played the role of the leading vampire Robert Pattinson. 

Charles wanted to protest but since his mom was sick and now that she was in the mood where she insisted in having things her way,&nbsp; he knew better to argue back against her. 

�So that settles it. Call your mom and tell her you are sleeping over here as we are going to be having a Twilight night tonight!�&nbsp; Sara becoming pushy.

�Yeah I think that&#8217;s a good idea.&nbsp; I haven&#8217;t seen any of the films or even read the books!�&nbsp; Ivy just making conversation.

�Well dear,&nbsp; I think you should!�&nbsp; Sara spoke in her insisting tone. 

�I will go to the lounge and make that call!�&nbsp; Ivy winking at Sara.

�You go do that dear.&nbsp; Charles while I clean up,&nbsp; why don&#8217;t you make Eva a nice hot cup of tea!� Sara speaking to her son in a bossy but friendly way.

Charles showed his annoyance and his mom only thought he was annoyed was because he was going to be forced to watch at least two twilight films with his mother and school friend. 

�Yes mom!�&nbsp; Charles bowed.

They both went to the kitchen.&nbsp; His mom was cleaning up at the sink while he was making a hot cup of tea for Ivy,&nbsp; when he was finished making it,&nbsp; he carried it all the way to the lounge.&nbsp; When he got to the lounge,&nbsp; Ivy was sat down at the sofa,&nbsp; right in front of the television.

Charles placed the hot cup of tea at the table, right in front of her.

�Thank you for the hot tea Charles,�&nbsp; Ivy was being sarcastic.

�Mom wanted me to make you tea!�&nbsp; Charles spoke diplomatically.

The last thing Charles wanted was to have a confrontation with Ivy,&nbsp; in his very own house.&nbsp; And in front of his mother. 

�Well looks like I am going to be spending the night here�.with you,�&nbsp; Ivy speaking playfully.

Charles tried to behave as if everything was normal,&nbsp; even if it wasn&#8217;t.&nbsp; 

�Well I have been to your place a couple of times and this is your first time here.&nbsp; I&#8217;m sorry if my house isn&#8217;t up to your standard.&nbsp; I mean your place is far far far bigger.&nbsp; I mean it&#8217;s humongous,.�&nbsp; Charles kept on talking until Ivy cut him off.

�Oh no dear. I don&#8217;t know why you are trying to play dumb with me. Just want you to know that nothing has changed between us. Too bad for you that your mom has taken a liking to me. Now if you don&#8217;t want to get on her bad side or make things even uglier between us, I suggest you behave like a good boy and sit right through these films with us,�&nbsp; Ivy threatening him in a soft tone.

Charles stared at Ivy.

�It looks like we are going to be spending the night together.&nbsp; Now be a good boy and come here!�&nbsp; Ivy smiled at him.

Charles just stood there,&nbsp; trying his best to be defiant. He hoped that she would just give up on him.

�Charlie you don&#8217;t want to make me angry.&nbsp; Now come here!�&nbsp; Ivy speaking to him in a soft but domineering tone. 

Charles sighed.&nbsp; He walked over to where Ivy was sat.&nbsp; before he could say a word, she hit him very quick at the stomach. Charles instantly put his hands on his chest&nbsp; and fell on his knees, right exactly in front of her.&nbsp; But before he could cry,&nbsp; she grabbed his head and pushed her lips towards his,&nbsp; French-kissing him. She only hit him so that he could only have some minor pain for less than a minute. She then let him go and playfully muffled his hair.

�And now another warning. Don&#8217;t do anything stupid tonight like locking your bedroom door. Ok,�&nbsp; Ivy playing with his short Blond hair.

Charles nodded like a school student.

�That&#8217;s my good Blond slave,�&nbsp; Ivy patting his head.

First she looked affectionate towards him with her blue eyes,&nbsp;&nbsp; and then she yanked hard at his hair.&nbsp; Her eyes looked more menacing and threatening.

�And don&#8217;t you ever fucking disobey me again or mommy Sara will know the truth about us!!�&nbsp; Ivy hissed,&nbsp; with power and authority in her voice,&nbsp; �I&#8217;ll make your life in your own home a living hell.�






















Chapter 24




The whole night Charles had been watching the first two Twilight films with his mom and Ivy.&nbsp; His mom was crazy over the actor Robert Pattinson.&nbsp; Every time Charles asked if his mom if he could be excused and his mom always got annoyed,&nbsp; telling him that he could chat with his friends some other time.&nbsp; 

Sara and Ivy sat together on the same large sofa that faced the tv while Charles sat alone on an armchair. 

There were moments of times when both ladies talked during the middle of the film.

�You have a great house Sara!�&nbsp; commented Ivy. 

�Why thank you Eva!!&nbsp; I am glad you liked it. This house is definitely better than the one we had in Manchester!!�&nbsp; remarked Sara.

Why is mom doing this to me,&nbsp; Charles was complaining in his head. 

�You are right Sara,�&nbsp; Ivy commented.

Right??&nbsp; About what??�&nbsp; Sara was confused.

�he is kind of cute!!�&nbsp; Ivy commented.

�Who dear??�&nbsp; Sara was confused.

�This guy who is playing Edward Cullen!�&nbsp; Ivy said.

�Oh you mean Rob Pattinson.&nbsp; He is from Heaven,&nbsp; isn&#8217;t he!!&nbsp; He is just so adorable I could eat him&nbsp; Sara responded with excitement.

Ivy then laughed.

�But I think Charles is far cuter than he is!!�&nbsp; Ivy commented. 

Sara&#8217;s eyes shot wide open.&nbsp; 

�Did you hear that love!!&nbsp; She said you are far cuter than ol&#8217; Edward here.&nbsp; Now isn&#8217;t that the greatest compliment anyone has ever said about you!!�&nbsp; Sara blushed.

Sara loved it that a beautiful girl like Ivy dare say to her face how she thought her son was cuter than the young man (except for Justin Bieber) deemed to be the cutest by most females around. 

�Yeah!!&nbsp; I am flattered!!�&nbsp; Charles responded sarcastically.

�You know Charles.&nbsp; You should change your attitude.&nbsp; I think you should take Eva out here on a date!!&nbsp; I think you make a lovely couple!!�&nbsp; Sara commented.

�Like Bonnie and Clyde!�&nbsp; Charles joked sarcastically.

By the time they were already watching the first 15 minutes of the third Twilight film,&nbsp; Ivy looked as if she had fallen asleep. 

�What time is it mom?�&nbsp; Charles asked his mom.

Charles yawned.&nbsp; He was tired.&nbsp; Sara looked at the lounge clock.&nbsp; It was already nearly one in the morning. 

�My Goodness.&nbsp; It&#8217;s nearly one.&nbsp; Looks like our guest here is already falling asleep.&nbsp; We better wake up and show her to her room!!!�&nbsp; Sara said.

Charles turned off the Blue Ray disc and Sara woke Ivy up.&nbsp; Sara led Ivy to one of the guest room upstairs.&nbsp; Charles helped Sara bring out a pillow, a blanket and even some sleeping pajamas for Ivy. Ivy yawned.&nbsp; The guest room already had a bed (just like all the other rooms before Charles and Sara moved in). 

�You are so kind Sara!!�&nbsp; Ivy complimented her.

�You are our guest dear!!�&nbsp; Sara said to her in a loving motherly way.

Charles was setting the blanket up over the bed. 

�So Charles where is your bedroom?�&nbsp; Ivy asked him in a yawning tone. 

Charles just stared at her.&nbsp; He was too tired to tell her or even think straight. 

�Charles, aren&#8217;t you going to tell her??�&nbsp; Sara sounded irritated. 

�I&#8217;ll show you!!�&nbsp; Charles yawned. 

Charles walked out of the guest room and Ivy and Sara followed him out to the upper hallway. Charles pointed to where his bedroom was.

�So if you need anything dear,&nbsp; Charles is just right over there.&nbsp; Not far from you.&nbsp; Well I am off to bed.&nbsp; I will make us all breakfast tomorrow when we are all up!!&nbsp; I&#8217;ll leave you in Charles&#8217;s safe hands.&nbsp; Good night you two!!�&nbsp; Sara yawned.

Sara walked all the way to her own bedroom,&nbsp; closing the bedroom door.

�I hope you enjoyed the twilight movies!!&nbsp; I don&#8217;t know about you but I am as tired as hell!!� Charles yawned.

�Would you want me to tuck you in bed!!�&nbsp; Ivy smiled at him. 

Ivy did look tired.&nbsp; She yawned very loudly.

�No I&#8217;m good.&nbsp; Thank you!!�&nbsp; Charles yawned.

�Well ok then.&nbsp; Good night Charles!�&nbsp; Ivy yawned,&nbsp; then retreating to the guest room. 

Charles retreated to his own bedroom. He closed the bedroom door,&nbsp; changed to more comfortable clothes and then switched off the bedroom lights.&nbsp; He went straight to bed. He was so tired that he lost consciousness. 



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *******


An hour later,&nbsp; Charles instantly woke up. He was facing the ceiling. There was someone with him in his bed. He then realized that he couldn&#8217;t move his wrists and that his mouth was covered with something.&nbsp; To his horror, he found himself in bondage.&nbsp; There was cloth in his mouth and his wrists were tied behind his back. Then he felt his hair being fondled .

�Hello Charles,�&nbsp; the other person called out in a mischievous tone. 
















Chapter 25




�You&#8217;re awake. That&#8217;s good. Your mom is a deep sleeper. She won&#8217;t hear us. Oh yes I locked your door too,�&nbsp; Charles heard someone whispering on his ear.

It was Ivy.&nbsp; He could make out her figure in the darkness. 

�Don&#8217;t bother screaming!�&nbsp; Ivy warned him.

She moved her fingers somewhere around his neck.

�I studied martial arts.&nbsp; One strike from me and you will only have thirty seconds to live. You will have a hard time breathing. You will be suffocating and eventually will die a painful death.&nbsp; Now do you want me to be nice to you or not!!�&nbsp; Ivy speaking to him in a cold and threatening, but also in a kinky and playful, tone.

Charles nodded his head,&nbsp; looking scared.&nbsp;&nbsp; Ivy then came on top of him. She was in control of him. 

�Charles are you scared of me!!�&nbsp; she taunted him. 

Charles nodded his head. 

�You know you don&#8217;t have to be.&nbsp; You should have remained loyal and obedient and I would have been a lot nicer to you. I just want you to know something Charles!!�&nbsp; Ivy spoke in a low but dead serious tone.

Charles didn&#8217;t hear Ivy speak for over a minute.&nbsp; He was sure that she was upset. Not much angry but more like sad. 

�I felt hurt when you turned away my offer to nurse you back.&nbsp; I was being sincere when I said how upset I was that you got sick and that I was bad mouthing you the whole time. I mean just because you&#8217;re my slave doesn&#8217;t mean I don&#8217;t care about you,�&nbsp; Ivy playing with hair gently.

She cares about me?&nbsp; She still cares about me??&nbsp; Charles thought.

There was a part of him that was happy to know this.

�You know I sometimes asked myself what would have happened if history started out different. I mean if I never met you and you never harassed me,&nbsp; I would have never ventured out into town more frequently. I&#8217;d like to think that I and the girls would. I also imagined what if it had been someone else who did those things to me years ago and that it had not been you.&nbsp; Things would have turned out much better between us. I liked you when I first met you. I thought you would have made a nice boyfriend. I mean we wouldn&#8217;t be angry with each other. I would have had no past vendetta against you and you wouldn&#8217;t have to be on the run from me. But this is the way fate has made us out to be. I, the hunter, and you, my prey. All I know is despite everything that has happened, I still want you.&nbsp; Did you like me when we were still friends?� she asked him.

Charles nodded his head.&nbsp; He still liked her or else he wouldn&#8217;t have risked meeting her near that cliff. 

�I mean even after you had your reunion party,&nbsp; you still text me.&nbsp; You said you miss my company.&nbsp; Did you mean it?�&nbsp; she asked him.

Charles nodded his head.

�But you&#8217;re afraid of me now.&nbsp; Ivy is the big bad wolf who kicked my ass.&nbsp; Isn&#8217;t that right Charles??� she teased him.

He shook his head.&nbsp; She slapped him really hard on the face.

SLAP

�Liar!!&nbsp; You are fucking afraid of me.&nbsp; I did kick your ass you idiot. It&#8217;s funny that though you are taller than me,&nbsp; I still whopped your big pale ass. And speaking of ass,�&nbsp; Ivy sounded kinky. 

Ivy worked on his underwear.&nbsp; She pulled it down.&nbsp; He didn&#8217;t bother struggling.&nbsp; Ivy then started stroking his cock.&nbsp; He liked that.&nbsp;&nbsp; A&nbsp; lot.

Then Ivy stopped,&nbsp; and made him move his body,&nbsp; so that he faced towards the direction of his window.&nbsp; 

�I got a surprise for you!!�&nbsp; Ivy whispered over his right ear.&nbsp; 

Ivy once more stroked his big cock,&nbsp; with her hand.&nbsp; He moaned underneath his mouth cover.&nbsp; 

Whatever you do,&nbsp; don&#8217;t stop,&nbsp; he wanted to tell her. 

Then all of a sudden he felt something hit his ass.&nbsp; He moaned heavily under his mouth gag,&nbsp; as his body jerked a bit forward.&nbsp; His legs trembled under the blanket. 

Ivy stuffed something up his ass.

�Surprise!!�&nbsp; Ivy yelled at his ear.

Ivy giggled.&nbsp; Charles was a bit in pain, as she stuck something up his pale sensitive ass. Charles nodded his head, as he was trying his best to withstand the pain.

�Now why is it that blokes enjoy fucking girls up the ass but hate it when the same is done to them!!�&nbsp; Ivy teased Charles. 

What Ivy had stuck up his ass was a beer bottle she had stolen from the kitchen downstairs.&nbsp; She trained her eyes to study his upper hallway in the dark,&nbsp; then walked all the way down towards the kitchen. She turned on the lights,&nbsp; opened the fridge, took out a beer bottle,&nbsp; opened it,&nbsp; emptied the liquid over the sink and then came back upstairs with it. Then she crept into his bedroom,&nbsp; as he was deep asleep. 

Ivy was moving the beer bottle, while it was stuck up his asshole. She used it on his ass like a dildo.&nbsp; As she continued ramming the bottle up his ass,&nbsp; she also continued stroking his cock.&nbsp;&nbsp; It was too much for Charles.&nbsp; It was pain and pleasure at the same time.&nbsp; His cock started ejaculating his sperm over one side of the bed.&nbsp; Now it was sticky and smelled like cum.&nbsp; 

Ivy could smell his sperm.&nbsp; 

�My. My. You are a naughty one,&nbsp; aren&#8217;t you!!�&nbsp; Ivy teased him.

Ivy mocked him,&nbsp; before rendering him unconscious.&nbsp; She took out his mouth gag and untied his wrists.&nbsp; She then slowly pulled the beer bottle out of his cock and placed it gently on top of his bedside table.&nbsp; 

Ivy walked out of his bedroom.

The Next Day &#8211; Saturday




There was a knock on Charles&#8217;s bedroom door.

KNOCK KNOCK

Charles woke up instantly.&nbsp; He was underneath the blanket.&nbsp; His cock felt relieved but his ass was aching like hell. 

�Come in!!�&nbsp; Charles cried.

Charles felt both like shit and dirty (because his cock was wet). He looked all around him.&nbsp; It was daytime.&nbsp; He saw an empty beer bottle on his bedside table.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He then smelled dried cum over his bed and his cock. 

The bedroom door opened.&nbsp; It was Ivy.&nbsp; Ivy smiled at him.

�Had a good sleep,�&nbsp; Ivy teased him.

Charles instantly remembered what happened before she rendered him unconscious. 

�Your mom made us breakfast dear.&nbsp; She is preparing everything on the table.&nbsp; I told her I&#8217;d wake you up.&nbsp; Go brush your teeth and wash up.&nbsp; Perhaps you would have to go clean yourself,&nbsp; if you know what I mean,�&nbsp; Ivy teased him.

She closed his bedroom door.&nbsp; He heard her giggling behind the door. 

Charles got up and went to the upper hallway bathroom.&nbsp; He washed his face and cleaned his teeth over the washing basin and the bathroom mirror.&nbsp; Five minutes later, he went to out some clothes on and joined his mom and Ivy at the dining hall.&nbsp; His mom made English Breakfast for all three of them.&nbsp; An English Breakfast consisted of hot sausages, two fried eggs, lots of cooked beans, sliced potatoes, four toasted slices of white bread, an egg omelet,&nbsp; two pieces of bacon,&nbsp; a cup of tea or coffee,&nbsp;&nbsp; and a glass of orange juice. 

All three of them ate their breakfast hungrily,&nbsp; but even talked while they were eating. 

�Did you have a good sleep Eva??�&nbsp; Sara asked Ivy.

�Sure did Sara!!&nbsp; You have a nice guestroom,�&nbsp; Ivy complimented.

�Thank you dear!!&nbsp; I had the loveliest dream.&nbsp; I dreamt I was with Edward Cullen.&nbsp; I was riding behind his back,&nbsp; while he was taking me on a long journey.&nbsp; We jumped from tree to tree and he moved really fast,&nbsp; like the wind.&nbsp; We saw mountains.&nbsp; We saw rivers. We saw people.&nbsp; We saw many Americans and many Canadians!!�&nbsp; Sara getting excited.

Charles was annoyed.&nbsp; 

Why did she have to bring up those stupid Twilight movies,&nbsp; he complained in his head.

�So mom what did he looked like?�&nbsp; Charles asked in a sarcastic tone.

�Who dear?!&nbsp; You mean Edward??� his mom was puzzled.

�I mean I am sure they give a description of him in the book but takes visualization. I mean the book doesn&#8217;t have a picture of Edward Cullen!!�&nbsp; Charles spoke sarcastically.

�Well I did see his face.&nbsp; He kind of looked like..like�.like that actor who played him!!�&nbsp; his mom expressed herself confidently and with pride.

�Maybe if Charles becomes a vampire,&nbsp; he could take us all for a ride to North America!!�&nbsp; Ivy joked.

Sara joked alongside Ivy.&nbsp; Ivy gave Charles a friendly but mischievous look. 

�Hey Charles it&#8217;s ten o&#8217; clock dear.&nbsp; Could you still go and open up the shop today!!�&nbsp; his mom said.

�Sure mom!!�&nbsp; Charles said.&nbsp; 

�I know it&#8217;s Saturday but you know that I still run the shop on Saturday,�&nbsp; his mom said. 

�Eva dear,&nbsp; you said you came here by bike.&nbsp; Maybe you can toss your bike at the back seat and have Charles give you a ride home!!�&nbsp; Sara suggested.

�Nah!!&nbsp; I think I&#8217;ll just follow him to the shop and take it from there.&nbsp; It was nice spending the night here Sara!!�&nbsp; Ivy said.

�Anytime dear!!&nbsp; When the last two films come out on Blue Ray discs,&nbsp; I will order them and then we can have more Twilight night,�&nbsp; Sara said.

Charles sighed sarcastically.

Five minutes after breakfast,&nbsp; Charles and Ivy got out of&nbsp; the house.&nbsp; Charles helped Ivy put her bike into the car trunk. She then joined him at the driver&#8217;s seat and as Charles started driving out of the driveway,&nbsp; both he and Ivy smiled and waved at Sara.&nbsp; Sara waved back.&nbsp; Charles&#8217;s car hit the road.

�My ass still aches from last night!�&nbsp; Charles complained.

�Let that be a lesson to you if you ever avoid me again or don&#8217;t return my phone calls!!�&nbsp; Ivy warned him in a cold menacing tone.

Charles gulped.

�And it is Mistress to you again,&nbsp; now that we are alone!!�&nbsp; Ivy reminded him.

Charles kept his eyes on the road,&nbsp; his hands on the steering wheel and pedals and his foot on the brakes. 

�Imagine what would happen if some of your friends came by your shop today and saw me inside your mom&#8217;s car!! Now wouldn&#8217;t that be something!!�&nbsp; Ivy laughed wickedly.

�Please Mistress,&nbsp; don&#8217;t give me a hard time ok.&nbsp; My mom is still sick and I have to work all by myself.&nbsp; My life is a lot harder than yours!�&nbsp; Charles begged.

�I know it is!!&nbsp; How about if I help you in your shop today or send one of my house servants to come and help you at the shop!!�&nbsp; Ivy suggested in a teasing tone.

Charles knew that Ivy was trying to keep him in check,&nbsp; by having her servant spy on him. 

�I know what you are going to say next.&nbsp; No Mistress it is not necessary. I work better alone. I think you should say something like how uncomfortable you would be. I just want you to know that I have spies everywhere. I know when your mom will be back at work.&nbsp; When she does,&nbsp; you are mine for the evening again. Now pull over here!!�&nbsp; Ivy ordered him.

Charles pulled the car over.&nbsp; They were in the middle of the road,&nbsp; situated between two vast green grass fields.&nbsp; 

�You are going to help me take my bike out from your trunk.&nbsp; Then I am going to have a word with you. Then you can go straight to work!!�&nbsp; Ivy ordered.

�Yes Mistress!�&nbsp; Charles sighed.

Charles and Ivy got out of the car.&nbsp; Charles helped get hr bicycle out of his car trunk. 

�I can be a good caring mistress.&nbsp; I can even take care of you.&nbsp; The problem is that you try your best to mess with me and cross me over.&nbsp; Just stop behaving like a moron and do as you are told. Despite how much I used to hate you,&nbsp; before you even came back to town,&nbsp; I want us to start over again,�&nbsp; Ivy said to him in a caring tone.

�Well you always boss me around as if I&#8217;m a worthless piece of shit!!�&nbsp; Charles responded emotionally.

�That&#8217;s because you are my slave!!! You swore to be my slave!!�&nbsp; Ivy reminded him.

�You tricked me into trying to save you when I thought you were going to fall off the cliff!!�&nbsp; Charles protested.

�Charles may I remind you that you nearly killed me once.&nbsp; And that was on purpose!!�&nbsp; Ivy sounded emotional.

�I was a little kid then.&nbsp; I really didn&#8217;t want to see you die. I never thought about it. I mean I know you drowned and I didn&#8217;t know what happened afterwards!!�&nbsp; Charles cried.

�Charles if it had been the other way around, you would have a grudge against me right now.&nbsp; If you nearly died,&nbsp; you wouldn&#8217;t be so easily forgiving either,&nbsp; regardless of what the other party thought at the time,�&nbsp; Ivy putting her arms around her chest.

�I&#8217;m sorry!!�&nbsp; Charles defended himself.

�If you were sorry you&#8217;d have made amends!!�&nbsp; Ivy told him.

�If I told you I wanted to,&nbsp; you wouldn&#8217;t believe me!!�&nbsp; Charles thinking about the time Brady told him the story and how much he still wanted to be with Ivy.

�Charles if you truly wanted to make amends and make it up to me,&nbsp; you would have offered to be my slave for the rest of your life.&nbsp; I mean even now you are my slave,&nbsp; but only because I saved your life when you forsaken mine!!�&nbsp; Ivy cried emotionally.

�Ivy please be fair!�&nbsp; Charles trying to change her mind.

�Charles the whole town was against us!!&nbsp; Well ok not the whole town but a lot of people were. They think we are dirty outcasts. They think we are a bunch of dirty gypsies,�&nbsp; Ivy cried back.

�Look I changed since you last knew me.&nbsp; I&#8217;m a different person,�&nbsp; Charles cried.

�Charles in our culture, the culture of the gypsy,&nbsp; when someone has done someone else harm, he can only make amends by becoming that person&#8217;s slave. His&nbsp; or her slave for life. I take my culture seriously Charles. You owe me. Not once. You owe me twice. I own you. You swore to be my slave. You swore it on your father&#8217;s parents&#8217; graves. You can&#8217;t break your vow unless I decide to release you of my own free will!!�&nbsp; Ivy stared at him seriously.

�So that&#8217;s just it then. Just like that!!�&nbsp; Charles sighed.

�To be honest I think I prefer to keep you as my slave. I won&#8217;t make your life worse than it already is, that is, if you continue to be obedient and loyal to me. I will keep in touch with you. Don&#8217;t try doing anything stupid!!�&nbsp; Ivy warned him. 

Ivy got on her bicycle but before she cycled away,&nbsp; she said one last thing.

�One other thing Charles.&nbsp; Don&#8217;t try leaving town!!&nbsp; I will hire a hitman to track you down,�&nbsp; she threatened him. 

She cycled over one of the fields.&nbsp; As for Charles,&nbsp; he got back inside his car,&nbsp; igniting the car key,&nbsp; starting its engine and then drove off. 

�She&#8217;s won!!&nbsp; If I leave town she is gonna kill me!! I am so fucking screwed!!�&nbsp; Charles panicked.

As Charles kept on driving,&nbsp; he also then started crying.&nbsp; He cried out of having not just lost to Ivy but for his life. He didn&#8217;t want to die, let alone be threatened with it.&nbsp; Charles also realized something.&nbsp; He smelled piss.&nbsp; He peed on his pants.

























Chapter 27




The week after,&nbsp; Sara had recovered and started working again in her own shop.&nbsp; Coincidentally,&nbsp; Charles had been getting text messages from Ivy, as in where and when to meet her.&nbsp; As always, she used him every night in all kinds of degrading and sexual ways.&nbsp; And once more he had to make his Thursdays free for his Mistress.

On the Thursday of the last week of September,&nbsp; Charles went to Ivy&#8217;s house,&nbsp; at around 1PM.&nbsp; She ordered him on Wednesday night to come to her house,&nbsp; by 1PM. He parked his bike at the bike rack by the side of the mansion. As for what he wore,&nbsp; he wore what she told him to wear for that day short white Addidas pants, white Reebok trainers (sports shoes), long red socks, and a white sleeveless shirt. 

This was also the first time he was entering her house during the day.&nbsp; Normally when he was her slave for the day, on Sundays and Thursdays, they spent it outdoors. He only came to the house during the evenings and nights. 

He saw the door bell but her instructions was for him to cal her cell phone when he was outside her door step. He rang her cell phone number. She picked up his call. 

�Where are you??� she asked him in flirting tone.

�I&#8217;m outside your house!!�&nbsp; Charles answered.

�Stay right there and I will send one of my servants to you.&nbsp; My servant will let you in and you are to follow his instruction,�&nbsp; Ivy hung up.

Charles waited outside the mansion for nearly twenty minutes until Ivy&#8217;s servant finally came and opened the front door for him. Charles had seen some of her servants and maids briefly and never really remembered who they were or what they looked like.&nbsp; This particular servant of Ivy was as tall as Charles but had balding black hair, a cold face and was in his forties.&nbsp;&nbsp; He was also dressed in a servant&#8217;s black attire;&nbsp; black pants, black jacket, a red tie, a red ribbon and white gloves. 

As for how Ivy communicated with her servants and maids within the mansion,&nbsp; they all had beepers and Ivy had a Master Beeper (like her mom, the other girls and their moms),&nbsp; which she could communicate with all her house employees. 


�Your instructions are to come inside the house and follow me!!�&nbsp; the servant bossed Charles.&nbsp; 

Charles stepped into the mansion&#8217;s front hallway.&nbsp; As the mansion&#8217;s front door opened up to a hallway,&nbsp; which had two corridors,&nbsp; the servant led Charles towards the left corridor.&nbsp; Charles had walked&nbsp; long stretch,&nbsp; seeing some other rooms with closed doors.&nbsp;&nbsp; The mansion&#8217;s lower floor was so huge that Charles felt he was walking inside a maze. After all, some of the corridors led to hallways,&nbsp; leading to other corridors on all sides. Whenever Charles was in Ivy&#8217;s mansion,&nbsp; they always spent their time inside her bedroom.&nbsp;&nbsp; Never downstairs or by the mansion&#8217;s lounge (that is, if there was only just one and not many). 

�This place is so huge!!�&nbsp; Charles commented.

�No talking!!�&nbsp; the servant told him in a sharp tone.

Charles felt as if he had just been slapped in his face.&nbsp; And by a house servant.&nbsp; 

They walked until they finally reached a door that stood alone in a narrow hallway. The servant then knocked on the door.

KNOCK KNOCK

This was to let Ivy know that he was coming in.&nbsp; The servant then turned the door knob.&nbsp; Charles and the servant walked through,&nbsp; then closing the door behind them.&nbsp;&nbsp; Charles saw Ivy, Megan, Katherine and a few other people dressed up as hospital surgeons. He saw an operating table,&nbsp; a few operating instruments on a set of trolleys,&nbsp; and&nbsp; what the room itself was like.&nbsp; It was a gray room, as large as a classroom,&nbsp; and had green fluorescent lights,&nbsp; hanging from its ceiling.&nbsp; Like a mixture between a detention and a police interrogation room. 

Charles gulped.

Is she going to have doctors do operations on me?&nbsp; Charles&nbsp; panicked in his mind.

What also startled Charles was Ivy.&nbsp; It was the way she was dressed.&nbsp; She was dressed in black,&nbsp; as a dominatrix.&nbsp; 

Before Charles could even move,&nbsp; like trying to run away,&nbsp; two tall and muscular servants appeared on both his sides,&nbsp; and grabbed his arms.&nbsp; One of those servants put his hand over Charles&#8217;s mouth.&nbsp; Then two servants dragged him all the way to where the operation table was.&nbsp; Charles muffled in fear as he didn&#8217;t know what Ivy was going to do to him next. Two more servants came and grabbed each leg.&nbsp; All four of them, pinned Charles body onto the operation table.&nbsp;&nbsp; Charles could see that the table had wrist and ankle straps,&nbsp; made of brown-green leather (likely to have been made out of crocodile skin). 

Ivy approached Charles,&nbsp; fondling his hair, while the four servants had him pinned down.

�I knew this would happen. I knew that the moment you saw this room and all the surgeons here,&nbsp; you would instantly go on panic-mode. Now trust me if I say nothing that is going to be done to you will harm you.&nbsp; Trust me.&nbsp; You are perfectly safe. You know if I wanted to harm you,&nbsp; I would have just brought a gun and forced it down your head but I didn&#8217;t,&nbsp; did I!�&nbsp; Ivy lectured him.

Charles was still scared.&nbsp; 

�Charles do I have your cooperation??�&nbsp; Ivy asked him in a cold tone.

Charles nodded.

�You can let go of him!!�&nbsp; Ivy ordered all four servants.

All four servants let go of his arms and legs.&nbsp; Charles remained at the operation table.&nbsp; He had fear in his eyes.&nbsp; 

�What�what�what are you going to do to me??�&nbsp; Charles asked her. 

�What I&#8217;m going to do to you? I was going to brand you as my property!!&nbsp; Why do you think I brought all my personal doctors here!!�&nbsp; Ivy commented. 

The surgeons were all Ivy&#8217;s mom&#8217;s personal doctors. Charles gulped.&nbsp; He saw Megan and Katherine smirked.

�What are they doing here?�&nbsp; Charles dumbly asked about Katherine&#8217;s and Megan&#8217;s presence.

�They are my sisters. I keep no secrets from them.&nbsp; Especially when it comes to something as personal as this!!�&nbsp; Ivy told him in a cold tone.

Ivy then walked up to him and slapped his face.

SLAP

�Aren&#8217;t you forgetting something slave!!�&nbsp; Ivy taunted him.

�I&#8217;m sorry Mistress!!�&nbsp; Charles apologized. 

He forgot to call her Mistress. 

Charles saw how many servants there were.&nbsp; It looked like there were more than ten. They were all tall and muscular.&nbsp; He was afraid that if he tried running, they would catch up with him and beat the crap out of him.&nbsp; 

�Now what I want you to do is to take off those lovely shoes,&nbsp; those red socks of yours,&nbsp; your white shirt and of course,&nbsp; your lovely sexy pants!!&nbsp; In fact I want you to take all your clothes off,�&nbsp; Ivy said to him.

�And please do it slowly,&nbsp; like you were a stripper or something!!�&nbsp; giggled Katherine.&nbsp; 

�Do what she says!!&nbsp; I want everyone here to see you naked!! Strip when the music starts playing!!&nbsp;&nbsp; �&nbsp; Ivy smiled at Charles.

Megan went over to one side of the gray room and started playing a song,&nbsp; from what looked like a radio.&nbsp; The song started playing.&nbsp; It was �macho man.�

Charles started taking off his shoes,&nbsp; then his clothes,&nbsp; to the beat of the music.&nbsp; All of Charles&#8217;s clothes and shoes lay down by his feet and he was totally naked. 

Megan stopped the playing the song.

Everyone could now have a good glimpse at his perfect physique. He tried covering his groins but she shouted at him.

�Take your fucking hands of your balls or I would have my surgeons turn you into a&nbsp; eunuch!!�&nbsp; Ivy yelled at him.

Charles instantly removed his hands from his groins. He didn&#8217;t want to be turned into a eunuch. He didn&#8217;t want them to remove his balls.&nbsp; The two other girls started laughing.&nbsp; The male servants and the doctors looked stone cold. 

�Now slave,&nbsp; I want you to lie down on the table!�&nbsp; she ordered him.

Charles bowed his head.

�Yes Mistress!!�&nbsp; Charles gulped. 

Charles climbed on top of the operation table.&nbsp; The doctors gathered around him. The servants helped moved the trolleys by their sides. The doctors pushed Charles&#8217; arms and legs to his side.&nbsp; One doctor put a ball gag on Charles&#8217;s mouth so that he could not scream but only moan over his ball gag.&nbsp; Charles then saw Ivy and the other girls standing by,&nbsp; as if they were sadistic spectators in ancient Rome,&nbsp; watching a gladiator fighting to the death against lions and tigers inside some Roman Coliseum. 

The doctors then strapped his wrists and ankles down the operating bed.&nbsp; Charles shook his head,&nbsp; fearing for what was about to happen next.&nbsp; Two doctors started working on his Blond pubic hair,&nbsp; using just normal scissors.&nbsp; They started snipping his Blond pubic hair short against his ultra-pale pubic skin. Charles was already scared,&nbsp; having nightmares that they would e cutting off his dick and balls by accident. 

As those two doctors&nbsp; clipped his&nbsp; Blond pubic hair, another doctor began to use a brush on Charles's hair, pulling and pinning it in various directions. Charles then felt cold liquid on the sides of his cock and hanging balls.&nbsp; He was able to look down long enough to see the shaving cream spread all over the sides of his genital,&nbsp; before the doctor working on his hair jerked his head upward again. Charles felt the edge of the razor as it removed overall his Blond pubic hair and the doctors shaved around his huge cock and English balls. 

Charles was now completely shaved underneath but that was merely the beginning.&nbsp; 

The two doctors then again started using the shaving cream all over his thighs,&nbsp; his chest,&nbsp; his arms and even his arm pits.&nbsp; They worked on him with precision and skill.&nbsp; Once all those parts were covered with shaving cream,&nbsp; they then used scalps to scrape all the hair off.&nbsp; They did it gently,&nbsp; especially on the armpits,&nbsp; and professionally.&nbsp; 

Charles was now completely hairless on all those parts.&nbsp; That was just the way Ivy loved him.&nbsp; In fact most women prefer their men to be hairless and be a bit more feminine. 

The same two doctors who shaved him off,&nbsp; then raised his butt a bit higher with their gloved hands,&nbsp; and one of them started fingering Charles on his ass.&nbsp; Charles closed his eyes,&nbsp; moaning in excitement.&nbsp; His two pink nipples stiffened.&nbsp; He could hear the girls giggling but right now he didn&#8217;t care, as he was liking this feeling.&nbsp; As he kept his eyes closed,&nbsp; he then felt something biting at his nipples.,&nbsp; very quickly. His green eyes opened really wide.&nbsp; He moaned underneath the ball gag.&nbsp; He moaned in pain. 

He saw one of the doctors holding a taser gun. Another doctor then came over to him,&nbsp; holding a needle. He pushed the needle first through Charles&#8217;s left nipple and then the right one.&nbsp; Next he quickly inserted on each nipple,&nbsp; two large rings.&nbsp; On the right nipple was inserted a gold ring.&nbsp; On the left nipple was inserted a silver ring. Charles realized that the rings pierced on both his nipples would keep them hard and solid. 

The doctors who operated on Charles moved away from him,&nbsp; only to be replaced by those doctors who hadn&#8217;t operated on him yet. 

�Those rings look good on him!!�&nbsp; Megan commented,&nbsp; then giggled.&nbsp; 

Charles saw Ivy looking her own lips,&nbsp; while both Megan and Katherine giggled behind her.&nbsp; They obviously enjoyed watching what was being done to him.&nbsp; Charles could nothing but groan and moan under that ball gag. 

The doctors who were now operating on Charles were also using needles and some other instruments.&nbsp;&nbsp; These doctors were going to be �tattooing� him.&nbsp; They first operated on his front parts.&nbsp; On those part of the thighs that were the closest to his balls,&nbsp; were tattooed the words SLAVE OF (on the right thigh closest to his balls) MISTRESS IVY (on the left thigh). On his tummy, were the tattooed words PROPERTY OF MISTRESS IVY. On his chest,&nbsp; between his pierced ringed nipples,&nbsp; was the image of a coiled serpent hissing&nbsp; (Ivy loved snakes).&nbsp; 

Charles was in panic mode as he knew that tattoos were for life.&nbsp; He hoped his mom never finds out or ever sees him naked.&nbsp; Before Charles could blink his green eyes,&nbsp; a doctor came up to him and put chloroform cloth over his face.&nbsp; Charles blanked out and lost consciousness.&nbsp; He flickered his eyelids,&nbsp; until they closed.&nbsp; Once he was unconscious,&nbsp; the doctors removed his ball gags and his wrist and ankle straps. 

They let Charles remain the way he was for over an hour.&nbsp; He laid unconscious,&nbsp; towards the ceiling. This was to let the tattoos in the front part of his body and the pierced rings on his nipples get accustomed to the body and allowing his body&#8217;s natural healing process to accept these �new alterations� to him, as part of his body. 

The servants then came and quickly turned Charles&#8217;s body over,&nbsp; so that he faced the bed while his back and ass faced the ceiling.&nbsp; 

�Ivy,&nbsp; his life will never be the same again!!�&nbsp; Megan pretended commenting seriously,&nbsp; before breaking out into giggles.

Ivy watched the doctors working on his back,&nbsp; with their tattooing needles and their other tattooing instruments.&nbsp;&nbsp; But before they started operating their needles on his back,&nbsp; one of them conversed with the other doctors and then turned around and talked to Ivy.

�We can&#8217;t work on him just yet.&nbsp; I think the other doctors would have to shave off the hairs behind his thighs and below his ass,�&nbsp; that doctor commented.

Ivy nodded.&nbsp; She looked at those doctors who did the hair-shaving job on Charles.&nbsp; She nodded on them and they first worked over Charles&#8217;s hair behind.&nbsp; They used shaving cream on the backs of high thighs&nbsp; (all the way to where his ass cheeks were),&nbsp; his back and the back of his arms.&nbsp; After the shaving cream had been spread on his back,&nbsp; they worked with their razors,&nbsp; until Charles was completely hairless on those parts too. 

The shaving doctors moved away,&nbsp; with the tattooing doctors taking their place.&nbsp; However,&nbsp; there was one particular doctor who stood out among them and he looked at Ivy.

Ivy nodded.&nbsp; 

�I think you are going to have to suit down next to us so that I can imprint your image on his back!!�&nbsp; that particular doctor told Ivy.

Ivy nodded,&nbsp; with Megan grabbing a stool, for her to sit down.&nbsp; This particular doctor was a professional artist,&nbsp; tattooing people&#8217;s faces onto people&#8217;s skin.&nbsp; Ivy sat somewhere next to that doctor and he worked his skills on Charles&#8217;s pale back.&nbsp; That doctor worked on Charles&#8217; back with precision and skill.&nbsp; He tattooed an image of Ivy,&nbsp; dressed as a dominatrix smiling wickedly,&nbsp; with her right hand holding a whip while her left hand was raising a glass of red wine.&nbsp; Above the image of Ivy the dominatrix were the words&nbsp; MISTRESS IVY and below the image&nbsp; were the words IS MY GODDESS.&nbsp; On his left ass buttock were the tattooed words MY NAME IS CHARLES.&nbsp; Above his asshole were the tattooed words AND I AM.&nbsp; On his right ass buttock were the tattooed words MISTRESS IVY&#8217;S BITCH.

When that professional tattooing doctor finally finished working on&nbsp; Charles,&nbsp; he turned to look at Ivy and said.&nbsp; �I&#8217;ve done it.&nbsp; He looks as good as new!!� 

Ivy looked at the unconscious Charles.

�The poor boy&#8217;s life will never be the same again!!�&nbsp; Ivy smiled wickedly. 

Ivy,&nbsp; Megan and Katherine laughed at what had been done to Charles Greene.&nbsp; She had made her own personal family doctors do alterations to the English boy&#8217;s sensitive pale white skin.&nbsp; What had been done cannot be undone.&nbsp; They were permanent.&nbsp; Charles was going to have those tattoos for the rest of his life.&nbsp; The tattoos were meant to show to the rest of the world who he was in life and marked him as a permanent slave to the girl he once bullied and harassed as a young boy.&nbsp; 

The tattoos were telling the world that Charles belonged to Ivy and was going to be Ivy&#8217;s slave for the rest of his life.&nbsp; 



























Chapter 28




While Charles had lay unconscious inside the operation room,&nbsp;&nbsp; Ivy took out her special I-Phone and filmed Charles&#8217;s behind.&nbsp; She moved from the back of his head all the way to his legs, filming all a large tattoo of her image on her slave&#8217;s own back. She then asked the servants to turn his body over, so that his unconscious face,&nbsp; was towards the ceiling.&nbsp; The servants turned Charles body over and now it was towards the ceiling.&nbsp; Ivy moved closer to his sleeping face,&nbsp; then down to the rest of his body,&nbsp; filming his pierced nipples and tattoos of her name over his body.

�He looks yummy!!&nbsp; I can eat him now!!�&nbsp; Ivy commented.

Katherine and Megan giggled from the side. 

Ivy asked the servants to carry his body all the way to her bedroom upstairs.&nbsp; While they were starting to carry his unconscious body,&nbsp; Ivy had a word with all the doctors,&nbsp; discussing the payment and about Charles&#8217;s tattoos and nipple piercing. 

The servants carried Charles&#8217; body up the stairs and when they reached and entered Ivy&#8217;s bedroom,&nbsp; they placed his body on her bed,&nbsp; and then left.&nbsp; Ivy and the two other girls entered the bedroom later on.&nbsp; 

Ivy looked at the time on her I-Phone.&nbsp; It was a quarter pass seven in the evening (7:15PM).&nbsp; Ivy went to her drawers, took out the cuffs and then cuffed Charles ankles and wrists to the upper and lower railings of her large bed,&nbsp; positioning him in a spread eagled formation. 

Ivy sat on a crouched position to Charles&#8217;s right,&nbsp; while Megan and Katherine were to his left.&nbsp; She then slapped his face very very hard.

SLAP

Charles slowly woke up.&nbsp; 

�I�I had a terrible dream!!�&nbsp; Charles sighed in a depressive tone.

Ivy looked at the gold ring on his right nipple and pulled on it.&nbsp; Charles screamed really loud.

�OOOOWWW!!�&nbsp; Charles cried really loud.

�Are you talking about this!!�&nbsp; Ivy teased him maliciously and cruelly.

�Ooh my God!!&nbsp; You fucking bitch!!&nbsp; You really did this to me!!&nbsp; How could you something like this to me??�&nbsp; Charles panicked.

SLAP

Ivy slapped him hard on the face.&nbsp; If she remembered carefully,&nbsp; he cooperated but that was because he was afraid that the servants would beat the crap out of him,&nbsp; if he didn&#8217;t.&nbsp; he also didn&#8217;t know that Ivy was planning on tattooing his body. 

�Don&#8217;t you ever fucking disrespect your Mistress by ever calling her a Bitch!!�&nbsp; Ivy scolded him,&nbsp; then twisting the silver ring on his left nipple.&nbsp; Charles screamed.

�OOOWWW!!�&nbsp; Charles&nbsp; screamed like Hell. 

Tears flowed down Charles&#8217;s green eyes.&nbsp; As far as he was concerned,&nbsp; his whole life was over.&nbsp; She had destroyed his body by having things done to it without his real consent. 

�You know&nbsp; a lot of people pay a lot of money to tattoo their own fucking bodies.&nbsp; I paid a lot of money for yours.&nbsp; I even paid to have some of your body hair removed.&nbsp;&nbsp; And this is how you talk to me!!�&nbsp; Ivy scolded him.

�You had no right!!�&nbsp; Charles wept,&nbsp; shaking his head.

�Would you rather than I have you killed??�&nbsp; she threatened him.

�Oh God!!&nbsp; Please don&#8217;t kill me!!&nbsp; Please don&#8217;t!!�&nbsp; Charles begged,&nbsp; �I&#8217;d rather live as a slave than be killed!!�

Megan and Katherine laughed.

�You know you should be glad that instead of having a hitman come after you or letting you fall down the cliff or letting Brady back there cut off your nuts,&nbsp; I came to your rescue.&nbsp; Especially after what you did to me back when we were kids.&nbsp; You know I toyed with the idea of having your genitals removed and having you castrated.&nbsp; But I didn&#8217;t.&nbsp; I could have done worst things to you.&nbsp; Worst!!�&nbsp; Ivy yelled at him.

�I can&#8217;t go home like this!! My mom, my friends, my gramps and the townspeople can never see me like this!!&nbsp; I will be an outcast!!�&nbsp; Charles wept.

�Then don&#8217;t ever strip off in front of them.&nbsp; And if you don&#8217;t want anyone else to know what happened today, you better stop rebelling and fighting me!!&nbsp; And if you think you are an outcast,&nbsp; the three of us have been outcasts for the rest of our lives.&nbsp; Now you know how we feel.&nbsp; Oh well you are one of us now.&nbsp;&nbsp; Another outcast. But so as long as no one knows about the tattoos, and of course you will be careful not to show your mom Sara your new nipple rings,&nbsp;&nbsp; you can&#8217;t really be an outcast.&nbsp; If the town knew the truth you will become one,&nbsp; for real,&nbsp; since everyone is going to see my name all over your body.&nbsp; Your best friends will stop hanging out with you. People will boycott your mom&#8217;s shop,&nbsp; because her own son is officially the slave of some wealthy outcast gypsy girl.&nbsp; And then when the townspeople turn against you,&nbsp; you can no longer go back home since your own mom would tell you to get away from her.&nbsp; No one is going to want to have anything to do with you. Then you would have nowhere else to go.&nbsp;&nbsp; Except here.&nbsp; Back to me!!�&nbsp; Ivy lectured Charles in the most malicious manner.

Ivy then moved the screen of the I-Phone closer to Charles&#8217;s face,&nbsp; showing he film she took today.&nbsp; Charles&#8217;s eyes show wide open,&nbsp; seeing how both his front and back parts are tattooed and pierced.&nbsp; He was shocked that an image of Ivy had been tattooed in his back. He had been fully branded like some cattle. 

�Charles you belong to me!!&nbsp; These tattoos will remind you that your entire life now is to serve me and that you live only for me!!&nbsp; I can be a kind nurturing&nbsp; Mistress&nbsp; or I can be a real bitch!!&nbsp; That choice,&nbsp; I leave to you!!&nbsp; There is no shame in you being my slave.&nbsp; slavery was a way of life for the last right thousand years but it got a bad name after the American Civil War!!&nbsp; I can be good to you and the town will never have to know what happened today or about your skin and body alterations.&nbsp; You can still live with Sara and from time to time hang out with some of your other buddies!!!&nbsp;&nbsp; Or I can show this I Phone video to the rest of the world and leave you to your faith!!&nbsp; In fact once the town hates you and you come back running to me,&nbsp; I am not sure if by then,&nbsp; I would want you or accept you or take you in!!�&nbsp; Ivy lectured maliciously.

Charles sighed in defeat.&nbsp; He decided that what&#8217;s done is done.&nbsp; He cannot get rid of the tattoos (even if he could the rings on his nipples).&nbsp; 

�I know you are only my slave not just because of your vows but also because you are afraid of me and what I can do to you!!&nbsp; I want you to be happy to be my slave!!�&nbsp; Ivy teased him.

She then moved on top of his body and started lapping her tongue at his right nipple.&nbsp; Megan and Katherine giggled.

As Ivy still had feelings for Charles,&nbsp; she just wanted to end his feeling of animosity towards her.&nbsp; The best thing for him to do is to happily accept his place as his slave,&nbsp; because it would be ironic that he had tattoo of names of someone he really disliked,&nbsp; over his body. 

Charles enjoyed having Ivy and lick and suck at his right nipple.&nbsp; He closed his eyes but suddenly jerked them wide open, as she used her mouth to pull his nipple&#8217;s gold ring.

Ivy stopped licking Charles&#8217;s nipple,&nbsp; and just sat on his tattooed tummy. 

�Hey Charles let&#8217;s play a game!!!&nbsp; I will ask you a question and you must answer my questions in twenty seconds.&nbsp; If you fail,&nbsp; I am going to pull one of your nipple rings!!&nbsp; Ok!!�&nbsp; Ivy teased him.

Megan and Katherine giggled.

�This is gonna be fun!!�&nbsp; Megan commented 

�I wish I had my own slave!!�&nbsp; remarked Katherine.

Ivy already had her two fingers twitching on his left nipple&#8217;s silver ring.&nbsp; Charles hated it when she pulled on his nipple rings.&nbsp; It hurt.&nbsp; Like hell.&nbsp; 

�Megan you can start counting!!&nbsp; Charles can you say five good things about me??&nbsp; Go!!�&nbsp; Ivy ordered him.

Megan started counting,&nbsp; from twenty all the way down to one.&nbsp; 

�You are smart. You are rich. You are beautiful. You&#8217;re a gypsy. The whole town likes you!!�&nbsp; Charles answered as fats as he could. 

Megan was still on �ten�&nbsp; but Ivy showed a �What-the-fuck� expression. 

�Ok.&nbsp; Wait.&nbsp; Your fifth answer is wrong. Towns doesn&#8217;t like me. The town fucking hates my guts.&nbsp; I bet you do too�&nbsp; Ivy snarled at him.

She angrily pulled his left nipple&#8217;s silver ring. 

�OOOWWW!!�&nbsp; Charles screamed at the top of his lungs.&nbsp; 

�Ok!!&nbsp; Another question!!&nbsp; Say ten bad things about yourself!!&nbsp; Go!!�&nbsp; she ordered him.

Megan started counting from twenty.

�I&#8217;m a jerk. I&#8217;m dumb. I fart. I wet myself at night. I get scared. I suck at a lot of things. I don&#8217;t even have my own car. I..I�.give me a moment!!�&nbsp; Charles panicked.

Megan was already at �Five� but by the time he could make one more answer,&nbsp; she had already said �one�.&nbsp; 

�Time&#8217;s up�loser!�&nbsp; Ivy humorously making that witch accent from Wizard of Oz. 

Ivy pulled his silver ring really high and then twisted it. 

�OOOOOOOOOWWWWWWWWW!!!!!!!!!!!�&nbsp;&nbsp; Charles screamed louder than before. 

Tears rolled down Charles&#8217;s green eyes.&nbsp; She really hurt him.&nbsp; His nipple ached from pain. Ivy knew she hurt him and decided that she wanted to make him feel better again.

�Poor baby!! Let mommy make you feel better!!�&nbsp; Ivy spoke to him in a soothing way.

Ivy licked his left nipple,&nbsp; letting her saliva drop on it, while she kissed licked and sucked on it.&nbsp; Charles liked that.&nbsp; It was making his left nipple feel much much better. Charles moaned.

�Does that feel much better??�&nbsp; Katherine teasingly asked Charles.

Charles nodded his head,&nbsp; closing his eyes. 

�Much much better!!�&nbsp; Charles moaned in ecstasy. 

Ivy then stopped licking.&nbsp; She smiled wickedly,&nbsp; and then pulled his gold ring from his right nipple a little bit.&nbsp; Charles instantly opened his eyes again, making a low scream.

Ivy then came on top of him and started French kissing him on the lips,&nbsp; with Megan and Katherine just sat there and watching. Charles French-kissed back. 

�She sure treats her slave nice!!�&nbsp; chuckled Katherine.

�When are we getting our own slaves??�&nbsp; Megan making wishful thinking comments.

Ivy stopped French-kissing Charles.&nbsp; She then asked the two other girls to help her remove the cuffs on his wrists and ankles.&nbsp; Once they took out the cuffs,&nbsp; Ivy then asked Charles to turn around and face the bed.&nbsp; 

�Yes Mistress!�&nbsp; Charles responded. 

Charles was puzzled why Ivy wanted him to lay face down.&nbsp; It was then she asked the two other girls to cuff his ankles and wrists once more to the railings.&nbsp; They did as she asked.&nbsp;&nbsp; Charles was once more spread eagled but facing the bed and his ass facing the ceiling. 

Ivy was admiring the tattoo of her image as a dominatrix on his back.&nbsp; Ivy then got off him and walked to one of her drawers.&nbsp; She took out a box of candles.&nbsp; She took one candle put and used own of her lighters to light it, setting its top part on fire.&nbsp; She then returned back to the bed. Megan and Katherine giggled.

�Hold this!!�&nbsp; Ivy handed the candle to Katherine.

Katherine got hold of the candle why Ivy went to retrieve a ball-gag.&nbsp; She then went to Charles and placed the ball gag on his mouth. Ivy then sat herself on his back,&nbsp;&nbsp; towards the direction of his feet. 

�Ok give it to me and I want you two to hold his butt cheeks wide open!!�&nbsp; Ivy told the other two.

Katherine and Megan giggled,&nbsp; as they were both sat by his butt cheeks,&nbsp; with Megan pulling his right ass cheek further wide and Katherine pulling his left ass cheek further wide.&nbsp; Ivy then moved the candle over his asshole,&nbsp; letting some wax drop down on hi asshole.

Charles shook his body really fast,&nbsp; within the restraints of his cuffs,&nbsp; and at the same time moaned really really loud under the ball gag. He was completely helpless to resist and do anything against the pain.&nbsp; His asshole was hurting really like hell. Ivy and the two girls were a bit sexually excited,&nbsp; their cunts getting a bit wet,&nbsp; watching wax drop into a young man&#8217;s asshole. 

Ivy let at least three more candle wax drop down into his asshole,&nbsp; causing Charles&#8217;s body to shake and moan and groan in totals agony. 

�This is&nbsp; better than a porn film!!�&nbsp; commented Megan.

Ivy and the girls leaned closer to his asshole.&nbsp; They could see red burnt marks from where his shit would normally come out from. 

�Awesome!!�&nbsp; Katherine was astonished,&nbsp; then licking her lips.

Ivy then moved the end-butt of the candle towards Charles&#8217;s asshole,&nbsp; turning his reddened ass into a candle holder. 

�Do you think his big white ass makes a nice candle stick holder?&nbsp; I mean if let say at night I decide to read one of my books, by his ass, and I switched off the lights, that it would look good and comfy and that his ass would do a good job of holding this candle stick straight??�&nbsp; Ivy asked the girls.

�Better yet!!&nbsp; I have my I-Pad with me right now.&nbsp; Megan go turn off the lights and let&#8217;s watch the film I have in my I-Pad by his ass!!�&nbsp; Katherine told Meghan.

Megan got up the bed and saw where one Ivy&#8217;s bedroom light switch was.&nbsp; She turned it off.&nbsp; In all the girls&#8217; bedroom.&nbsp; Because their bedrooms were as big as school libraries, there were light switches everywhere,&nbsp; just for that one bedroom. 

The girls huddled by Charles&#8217;s ass,&nbsp; watching a film on Katherine&#8217;s I-Pad.&nbsp; They were watching the first part of the fourth Twilight film Breaking Dawn.&nbsp; Charles hated it. Not only that they had wounded his pride, hurt his ass, turned his ass into a candle stick holder while they all watched a film over it,&nbsp; but of all the films it had to be one he really hated.

Charles groaned under the ball gag. 

�Shut up Charles. Can&#8217;t you see your Mistress and her sisters are trying to watch a film here!!�&nbsp; Ivy complained.

The girls watched the entire movie,&nbsp; on Kate&#8217;s I-Pad, over Charles&#8217;s ass the whole night.&nbsp; As they watched, some of the candle wax dripped down towards his ass cheek,&nbsp; causing Charles to shale his body a bit and moan and groan really loud under his ball gag. Tears rolled down his green eyes. But the girls were too glued to the film to even pay attention to Charles&#8217;s pain and suffering. 





































Chapter 29




It was Saturday Evening,&nbsp; somewhere around 8PM.&nbsp; Charles was spending the night at Ivy&#8217;s,&nbsp; lying to his mom that he was spending at Brady&#8217;s.&nbsp; They were inside Ivy&#8217;s bedroom,&nbsp; eating cooked pizza,&nbsp; drinking coke,&nbsp; and eating garlic bread.&nbsp; They were sat down on Ivy&#8217;s bedroom sofa,&nbsp; eating and watching over her large near-cinema sized flat screen TV.&nbsp;&nbsp; 

The two other girls Megan and Katherine went out for the night,&nbsp; leaving Ivy all alone with her slave. 

As for what they were watching,&nbsp; it was Francis Ford Coppola&#8217;s Bram Stoker&#8217;s Dracula,&nbsp; the 1992 movie starring Keanu Reeves and Gary Oldman. 

As they were eating,&nbsp; Ivy would sometimes hold Charles&#8217;s hand,&nbsp; smiling lovingly at him. 

�Your Mistress loves this film as much as she loves her slave!!�&nbsp; Ivy speaking to Charles affectionately.

Charles enjoyed the food but really hated the film.&nbsp; It was slow. It didn&#8217;t have fast-paced action,&nbsp; like other horror films such as Blade or Underworld. 

As they were watching,&nbsp; Charles saw that Ivy was glued to the film (like she was when she was watching the I-Pad movie over his ass two nights ago when she used it as a candle stick holder).&nbsp; Charles thought that he could close his eyes for a while and rest his head on the sofa.

Charles was resting for ten minutes until he felt Ivy pulling and twisting on his left nipple&#8217;s silver ring.

�Ooouucchh!!� Charles cried loudly.

He looked at Ivy. She was pissed at him. 

�You sleep one more time while we are having a nice moment and I am going to do more than just pull this fucking nipple ring of yours!!�&nbsp; Ivy warned him.

Charles gulped.

�I&#8217;m sorry Mistress!! I was just closing my eyes for a while!!�&nbsp; Charles said.

�Well you can close your eyes when you go to sleep!!�&nbsp; Ivy told him off.

�Look.&nbsp; I know you like this movie but I don&#8217;t Mistress,�&nbsp; Charles confessed.

�What???&nbsp; You don&#8217;t like this film??&nbsp; What is wrong with you?? It&#8217;s a great film!!&nbsp; I thought you like horror films??�&nbsp; Ivy was surprised.

�But not this one Mistress!!&nbsp; It is too slow!!�&nbsp; Charles said.

�This film is romantic Charles.&nbsp; You know why I put this film on.&nbsp; So you and I can have a romantic evening.&nbsp; I mean I got the impression that you thought you didn&#8217;t mean anything to me and here I was thinking I can prove you wrong and that I do have a more loving side!!�&nbsp; Ivy cried to him in a high pitched voice.

Charles gulped,&nbsp; fearing that he may have woken up a sadistic monster again. He had seen her sadistic side and always prayed that he steered clear away from it. 

�Ok Charles.&nbsp; I am going to stop this film,&nbsp; since I am going to be the only one enjoying it. I know for a fact that you hate Twilight when we saw it back with your mom at your place. Hey Charles what do you think of Titanic?�&nbsp; she asked him in a teasing way. 

�Ugghh.&nbsp; Hate DiCaprio Mistress!!�&nbsp; Charles made a yuck expression.

Ivy laughed really loud. 

��Charles guess what!!&nbsp; We are going to watch Titanic!!�&nbsp; Ivy teased him.

Ivy laughed,&nbsp; seeing the horror on Charles&#8217;s eyes.&nbsp;&nbsp; Ivy then pulled his face closer to hers,&nbsp; kissing him firmly on the lips.&nbsp; 

�Your Mistress is just kidding you.&nbsp; If you can&#8217;t stand Leo,&nbsp; we won&#8217;t watch Titanic then.&nbsp; I actually hated that film anyways. Unrealistic shit!!�&nbsp; Ivy commented.

�So what are we going to do Mistress??�&nbsp; Charles asked.

�How do you feel about Avatar??&nbsp; I know a lot of blokes are crazy over it. Do you wanna watch Avatar??�&nbsp; Ivy asked him.

�Yeah!!&nbsp; Avatar sounds great Mistress!!�&nbsp; Charles smiled.

Charles actually liked Avatar.&nbsp; Many guys loved Avatar the way many girls loved Twilight.&nbsp;&nbsp; Ivy took Dracula out from the Blue-Ray disc and put Avatar inside.&nbsp; This time Charles had a good time watching a film,&nbsp; with Ivy.&nbsp;&nbsp; When they were watching the movie,&nbsp; Ivy was holding his hand much more firmly.

After the movie was over,&nbsp; they had a romantic moment.&nbsp; Ivy moved closer to him,&nbsp; kissing him firmly on the lips and he had to kiss her back.&nbsp; 

�Charles,&nbsp; let&#8217;s go over to the bed!!�&nbsp; Ivy suggested.

�Yes Mistress!!�&nbsp; Charles nodded.

They went over to Ivy&#8217;s bed,&nbsp; instantly taking of all their clothes.&nbsp; Ivy asked him to make love to her. He kissed her,&nbsp; sucked her nipples and moved his tongue on her cunt.&nbsp;&nbsp; Even though she let him put his cock up her cunt, she didn&#8217;t want anal sex. 

When he was done making his moves on her, she then was making her moves on him.&nbsp; She did this by cuffing his wrists and ankles to the bed railings.&nbsp; She would go on top of him ,&nbsp; pressing her lips towards his.&nbsp; She would then go down on his cock,&nbsp; taking his big cock into her mouth.&nbsp; Once she had his cock in her mouth, her jaw would start working on it,&nbsp; sucking him off.&nbsp; He would make moaning sounds.&nbsp; 

�OOOWWW!!!� Charles moaned,&nbsp; in pleasure.

Ivy was sucking his cock and drinking his cum.&nbsp; Her lips and tongue worked on the tip of his cock.&nbsp; She then stopped sucking him and got on top of him,&nbsp; kissing him firmly on the lips.&nbsp; As they kissed,&nbsp; she would transfer his cum from her mouth to his,&nbsp; making him drink his own cum. Charles knew now what sperm tasted like. 

As Ivy French-kissed him,&nbsp; she would pull and twist his nipple rings,&nbsp; causing his body, as well as his cock, to shake.&nbsp; It felt pleasurable,&nbsp; sensitive&nbsp; and a little bit painful all at the same time. She stopped French-kissing him and went down onto his nipples she would kiss, lick and suck on them, but at the same time sue her mouth to playfully his nipple rings. 

�You know how much I paid for your rings!!�&nbsp; Ivy was fondling Charles&#8217;s hair while fiddling with his gold ring on his right nipple. 

�No Mistress!!&nbsp; How much??� Charles shook his head and then asked. 

�I think it was about �795.!!&nbsp; The silver ring was a lot more cheaper. That cost me about �650.&nbsp; I think the rings look good on your nipples!!�&nbsp; Ivy commented.

Charles sighed.&nbsp; He admitted to himself that the rings on his nipples sometimes made his cock stiffen as it made him sexually excited but at the same time kept his nipples firm and harden.

Ivy looked at his chest tattoo.&nbsp; Charles had the tattoo of a coiled serpent. 

�Do you ever look at your tattoos??�&nbsp; Ivy asked Charles.

�No Mistress!!�&nbsp; Charles shook his head.

Charles lied. He only glimpsed at his tattoos,&nbsp; shocked at what Ivy had done to him. But there were many guys out there who had tattoos of serpents and dragons all over their bodies. He was never going to go naked in front of his mother.&nbsp; He knew it would not be wise to even take his shirt off now,&nbsp;&nbsp; even during a heat wave.

�I like snakes!!&nbsp; They are the tough predators!!&nbsp; Did you know that in ancient times, people worshipped snakes as gods!!�&nbsp; Ivy said.

�Oh!!&nbsp; I did not know that!!�&nbsp; Charles replied.

Ivy looked at him.&nbsp; She then smiled at him lovingly and then kinkily.&nbsp; She then moved to his side,&nbsp; looking down on his tummy.&nbsp; She moved the tip of her finger all over his tummy.&nbsp; Charles felt funny as she did this to him. 

�Property of Mistress Ivy,�&nbsp; Ivy reading the words tattooed on his tummy.&nbsp; 

Charles sighed,&nbsp; being reminded that she had tattooed him as her property,&nbsp; forever reminding him that he is her eternal slave.

�So you are the property of Mistress Ivy huh!!&nbsp; Is that true!!�&nbsp; Ivy teased Charles.

�Yes I am Mistress!!�&nbsp; Charles nodded his head,&nbsp; still sighing.

�I want you to say it louder!!�&nbsp; Ivy sounding serious.

Charles gulped.

�I am the property of Mistress Ivy,�&nbsp; Charles said in low monotone.

�I want you to say it louder,�&nbsp; Ivy ordered him.

�I am the property of Mistress Ivy,�&nbsp; Charles said it now in a much higher tone.

�Louder!!�&nbsp; Ivy bossed him.


�I am the property of Mistress Ivy,�&nbsp; Charles said it much much louder than the first two times.

�I can&#8217;t hear you!!�&nbsp; Ivy teased him,&nbsp; then pulling his gold ring nipple.

�I am the Property of Mistress Ivy!!�&nbsp; Charles cried at the top of his lungs.

The way she had pulled his nipple ring hurt.&nbsp; Ivy just laughed at the background.

�Charles not so loud,�&nbsp; Ivy chuckled.

Ivy laughed,&nbsp; enjoying what she was putting her male slave through.&nbsp; Charles&#8217;s ego had been bruised up a bit.&nbsp;&nbsp; He felt like he was just a toy for her.&nbsp; To be used.&nbsp; And to be abused.

�You look so upset Charles.&nbsp; Tell mommy what is wrong!!�&nbsp; Ivy was mucking about.

�Please Mistress.&nbsp; Don&#8217;t pull my ring nipples like that.&nbsp; It hurts.&nbsp; It really hurts!!�&nbsp; Charles cried,&nbsp; in agony.

Ivy then sucked on his right nipple,&nbsp; making it feel much much better. She hurt him so now she got to make it right. After all, this was supposed to be a romantic evening,&nbsp; not really a BDSM one. 

�Don&#8217;t cry now sweetie.&nbsp; Mommy will take care of you.&nbsp; Just relax, don&#8217;t be scared anymore,&nbsp; and close your eyes!!�&nbsp; Ivy told Charles.

Charles did as Ivy said.&nbsp; He closed his eyes,&nbsp; enjoying Ivy&#8217;s lips and saliva easing the pain on his right nipple. 

�AAHH!!&nbsp; AAAHH!� Charles moaned in pleasurable ecstasy.

Ivy then started kissing and sucking his right nipple. His right nipple felt as if it was being sucked by a vacuum cleaner,&nbsp; by the way Ivy was sucking on it.

�OOOWWWW!!!!&nbsp;&nbsp; OOOOOOWWWWW!!!!!!!�&nbsp; Charles moaned much more.

After sucking his right nipple,&nbsp; Ivy then worked on his left nipple. She sucked and kissed at it,&nbsp; continuing to put him more in greater comfort. 

�AAAHHH!!&nbsp;&nbsp; AAHHH!!�&nbsp; Charles moaned.

Ivy used less lip force on his left nipple than she did on his right one. 

After having sex until 5AM in the morning,&nbsp; Ivy untied Charles and they both slept together on her bed,&nbsp; under the blanket.&nbsp; Ivy was hugging lovingly at Charles. Her right&nbsp; arm was on his chest while her left hand was holding Charles&#8217;s right hand firmly.










Chapter 30




First week of October &#8211; Tuesday 


Charles was having lunch with Brady and the gang at a diner called The Elvis.&nbsp; It was diner modeled after American diners from the 1950s,&nbsp; and named after the famous singer Elvis Presley, known to the rest of the world as the King of Rock and Roll.&nbsp; Despite the fact that Constantinople&#8217;s Lot was a small town, there were some who were fans of the legendary singer and wanted to temporarily live a 1950s American setting.&nbsp; For those people, this diner was the place to be.

All five guys were sat by a table near the window,&nbsp; enjoying the sunless chilly afternoon.&nbsp;&nbsp; Brady was savouring the taste of the hamburger in his mouth.&nbsp; Thomas was savouring the salty taste of the fries in his mouth.&nbsp; Alex was slurping his cola drink.&nbsp; Pete was yawning.&nbsp; Charles was looking at all his friends,&nbsp; laughing and chuckling.

�What is so funny?�&nbsp; Pete was wondering.

�You guys are funny.&nbsp; That is what!!�&nbsp; Charles said,&nbsp; then broke out into laughter.

�I&#8217;m glad we are making you laugh,�&nbsp; Thomas commented,&nbsp; then laughing himself too.

�I don&#8217;t know what I will do without you guys�&nbsp; Charles said.

He really loved these guys.&nbsp; They were the brothers he never had. Being his mom&#8217;s only child, he did wonder at times, what would it have been like if one of them had been his biological brother?&nbsp; Would they still be good with each other and be friends or would they quarrel over a lot of things?

�You&#8217;d be bored.&nbsp; In fact I think you&#8217;d kill yourself!!�&nbsp; Brady chuckled.

�Yeah I supposed so,�&nbsp; Charles nodded his head,&nbsp; laughing at his friend&#8217;s joke.

�Hey Charles you know it&#8217;s October right!!�&nbsp; Pete spoke to Charles in a tone suggesting that he was on to something.

�Of course I know Pete.&nbsp; Why&#8217;d you bring that up??� Charles was surprised.

�It&#8217;s October mate.&nbsp; You know what that means. It means that in a few weeks it is gonna be Halloween!!�&nbsp; Pete cried with excitement.

�Oh yeah.&nbsp; Never thought about that!!�&nbsp; Charles said in an astonished tone.

�This is going to be the first time that you are celebrating Halloween with us,&nbsp; since you last left,�&nbsp; Brady chuckled,&nbsp; patting Charles on the shoulder.

The last time they all celebrated Halloween was seven years ago,&nbsp; and that was when Charles led the other kids all the way to Ivy&#8217;s mansion,&nbsp; just to throw rotten eggs on it.

�Hey what do you guys do during Halloween anyways??�&nbsp; asked Charles.

All four guys looked at each other,&nbsp; and then back at Charles.

�Well we don&#8217;t have Halloween parties that we can attend go to,&nbsp; like in the big cities!!�&nbsp; Alex sighed.

�I take it that you know all this from the Internet and television!!�&nbsp; Charles was on to his friend.

Alex smiled,&nbsp; then nodded his head.

�Well the kids dress up in their costumes and for trick or treating.&nbsp; As for kids our age,&nbsp; we do something else!!�&nbsp; commented Brady.

Charles wasn&#8217;t sure what Brady meant. 

�You mean you guys don&#8217;t dress up in costumes??�&nbsp; Charles was surprised.

Brady and all the guys smiled.

�Of course we do!!&nbsp; What is Halloween without costumes and masks!!�&nbsp; Thomas said.

�But no one in Constantinople&#8217;s Lot throws Halloween parties!!&nbsp; Parents don&#8217;t often allow their kids to throw them!!&nbsp; I never remembered anyone from school who ever threw a Halloween party!!�&nbsp; Alex was being comical.

�But they still let us out and celebrate it so it is not all so bad.&nbsp; Even if it means we have to celebrate it outside,�&nbsp; Pete interjected.

Alex looked at Pete,&nbsp; as if he had been beaten in his own argument.

�So what is it that you guys do again Brady?�&nbsp; Charles asked.

Charles was curios.

�Well like I said,&nbsp; all the kids in our class get together every Halloween evening and meet up at Connor&#8217;s Hill.&nbsp; We bring food and drinks and gather together.&nbsp; We set up a campfire and tell each other ghost stories!! It&#8217;s a tradition the kids in our class do every single year!&nbsp; I mean just because we have graduated from school doesn&#8217;t mean that we have stopped keeping in touch with each other.&nbsp; Man aren&#8217;t you excited!!�&nbsp; Brady sounded excited.

The hill they were going to meet was called Connor&#8217;s Hill.&nbsp; This was the first time Brady had indicated that the hills and woods in this town had names.&nbsp; Charles never thought about that.&nbsp; That meant that the hill where Ivy&#8217;s mansion was,&nbsp; must have a name too.&nbsp; And the woods leading up to that hill.&nbsp; And maybe even the beach and the cliff that loomed over it.&nbsp; When he first hung out with Ivy and the girls, and she acted as his tourist guide, she never even told him that any of these places she took him to even had names. 

�Hey Charles you have to come out with us on Halloween!!&nbsp; You just have to.�&nbsp; insisted Pete.

Charles wanted to go out with his friends.&nbsp; If he wasn&#8217;t free would only be for two reasons: His mom and Ivy.&nbsp; He was sure that his mom would want him to have a good time.&nbsp; She would probably give him the night off.&nbsp; But Ivy?&nbsp; She might want to have him for that night,&nbsp; as she normally had him like nearly every night. If he was going to be with his friends, he would have to lie to Ivy that his mom would want him with her during that night. That would leave Ivy no choice as neither of them wanted his mom to know what was really going on between them. 

Charles then thought about it. Ivy was still mad about what he and the other kids did to her house on Halloween night seven years ago.&nbsp; He was sure that it would not be a good idea to be with Ivy during Halloween. If she was with him and her memories about that night came flooding back,&nbsp; she would get emotional with him and do malicious things towards him.&nbsp; He did not want that. 

�I don&#8217;t think I ever been to Connor&#8217;s Hill!!�&nbsp; Charles said.

He actually wasn&#8217;t sure if he really visited every single hill, beach, woods and cliffs in Constantinople&#8217;s Lot.&nbsp; He wanted to even ask about the name of the area where Ivy lived,&nbsp; including the beach, the woods and the hill where her house was,&nbsp; but then thought to himself there was no point.&nbsp; He feared it would raise suspicions. 

�Then we shall take you there on Halloween,&nbsp; and later spend the night at my place!!�&nbsp; Brady said,&nbsp; �I&#8217;m sure mom and dad will be ok with it.�

�That sounds cool to me!!�&nbsp; Charles liking the idea.

Charles was sure now more than ever.&nbsp; It was best to be with Ivy during Halloween,&nbsp; knowing her too well when she gets emotional. 




Chapter 31



First week of October &#8211; Thursday afternoon


Charles was over at&nbsp; Ivy&#8217;s place,&nbsp; in her bedroom.&nbsp; He was serving Ivy and the girls, as if he was a mixture between a male equivalent of a housewife and a maid. Ivy and the girls were sat down on her sofa,&nbsp; watching films on Ivy&#8217;s ultra-large flat screen while Charles would go around and be bringing them drinks on a tray.&nbsp; The tray was being held up by chains attached to his ring nipples (thanks to Ivy) and the tray itself was tied to his waist by a strap. He wore no clothes.&nbsp; 

He would walk all the way to the large ice box,&nbsp; which had lots of cold beer cans and he would take the ones that the girls ordered and bring to them.&nbsp; Apart from the ice box,&nbsp; he would also be bringing them bags of crisps,&nbsp; piled up on some basket. 

When it was 4PM in the afternoon,&nbsp; all the girls were watching an episode of Sex and the City,&nbsp; from one the series on Blue-Ray.&nbsp; In the meantime Charles was crouched down in front of Ivy,&nbsp; being made to lick his Mistress&#8217;s cunt. Ivy had her left hand on top of his blond head,&nbsp; as if keeping him in his place.

Charles&#8217;s tongue and jaw had been working on Ivy&#8217;s cunt until 9PM.&nbsp; By then Megan and Katherine left Ivy&#8217;s bedroom,&nbsp; to do their own things.&nbsp;&nbsp; 

�You are such a good slave Charles!!�&nbsp; Ivy said.

She patted Charles on his head while he was still crouched down.&nbsp; His thighs were aching.&nbsp; His jaw was tired.&nbsp; His tongue felt wobbly.&nbsp; He felt weight on his nipples because the chains attached to them were holding the tray up. He had never felt so uncomfortable in his life. 

�Why the sad face Charles??� asked him.

She fondled with his blond hair. 

He could smell alcohol coming from her mouth.&nbsp; All over where the girls were sat,&nbsp; were piles of bags of crisps and emptied beer cans. This part of the room was starting to smell like the bars that they go to at night. 

�The tray is putting pressure on my nipples Mistress. Can I please take it off??!!�&nbsp; Charles begged.

Charles looked as if he was going to cry.&nbsp; The pressure was slowly turning to that of pain.&nbsp; Ivy smiled at him.&nbsp; 

Ivy thought that the way she was smiling, he was thinking that she was happily stalling and wanting to see him more in pain.

�Alright Charles.&nbsp; You look like you are going to cry.&nbsp; Did I ever tell you that you look cute when you are sad and scared??�&nbsp; Ivy asked him.

�No Mistress!!�&nbsp; Charles responded in a tone suggesting discomfort and fear.

Charles shook his head.&nbsp; 

Ivy smiled at him and then worked on the chains connecting the tray and his nipple rings.&nbsp; She then told him to stay out while she walked away with the tray. She came back to him by the tv and sofa 10 minutes later. 

Ivy was more or less drunk but her mind wasn&#8217;t completely wasted. She could still think straight,&nbsp; but still feel a bit sick from all that drinking. 

�Charles can you carry me to the bathroom!!&nbsp; I don&#8217;t really feel so well!!�&nbsp; Ivy said.

�Yes Mistress!!�&nbsp; Charles responded.

Charles carried her in his arms,&nbsp; all the way to the bathroom.&nbsp; When they finally reached the bathroom door,&nbsp; Ivy went towards the bathroom door,&nbsp; opened it and ran to where the washing basin.&nbsp; She turned on the water taps to let the water run and she washed herself in front of the bathroom mirror.&nbsp; Charles could see it all as she did not close the bathroom door. 

�Charles come in here!!�&nbsp; she ordered him in a nice way.

�Yes Mistress!� he responded,&nbsp; as if he were her butler.

Charles tried seeing himself more as if he was like her employee rather than acknowledging that he was lower than butler.&nbsp; He was her personal slave.

Charles entered the bathroom.&nbsp; 

�Charles I think I am going to pee very soon.&nbsp; I want you to lay your head on the toilet and open your mouth really wide!!�&nbsp; she told him.

Charles felt upset.&nbsp; Why did she have to pee into his mouth? Why did she forever do demeaning things to him, despite the fact that she admitted really liking him and even having romantic evenings with him,&nbsp; from time to time? 

Charles knew better to disobey.&nbsp; He positioned his head on the toilet seat,&nbsp; laying his body on the tiled toilet bathroom floor and opened his mouth really wide. 

He asked himself: why couldn&#8217;t she take his feelings about all this more into consideration?

Ivy took out her panty and then raised her pussy over his opened mouth.&nbsp; She started pissing into it.&nbsp; Charles was drinking and smelling salty urine.&nbsp; The way it shot down his throat felt like a needle was hitting into his body. When she was done,&nbsp; she moved away from him and put her panty back on. 

�I feel happy whenever I piss inside your mouth. Your mouth is taking care of all my waste, which is actually very touching because I think my waste is precious. After all, it came out of me!!�&nbsp; Ivy commented,&nbsp; then smiled.

Before Charles could say another word,&nbsp; Ivy started throwing up&nbsp; All her vomit rained down on his face and upper body.&nbsp; It happened so fast. Neither of them knew or were prepared for it. Charles&#8217;s cute face and fit body were now covered in Ivy&#8217;s vomit. He stunk.

Ivy&#8217;s jaw dropped open.&nbsp; She was shocked. She had never ever vomited on him before. As she was still partly drunk and a darker part of her personality began to take over,&nbsp; she started laughing. She found it erotic and funny at the same time. This was of course coming from a very very dark part of her,&nbsp; which was now coming out thanks to&nbsp; all that alcohol she had been consuming the whole day. 

Charles just felt like he was dirt to her. That he was just nothing. No he corrected himself. He was not even nothing. He was even less than nothing. He was now partly psychologically traumatized by what she had just done to him.

Ivy looked as if she needed to shit.&nbsp; Charles could do nothing as his mind was just preparing for another Ivy-made catastrophe headed his way. 

�Oh God!!&nbsp; My stomach is feeling like shit!!�&nbsp; Ivy cried.&nbsp; She quickly pull down her panty and raised her ass over Charles&#8217;s mouth. 

�As my obedient slave I command you to open your mouth!!�&nbsp; Ivy screamed at him.


Charles automatically opened his mouth wide&nbsp; open,&nbsp; as if he was now just some kind of Japanese ass-cleaning machine (like the ones they have in Tokyo).&nbsp; Her ass then started spurting out shit all over his face and into his mouth. He was smelling and eating shit at the same time.&nbsp; It happened even much faster than the vomiting.&nbsp; Ivy shit into his mouth and face continuously and Charles was letting it all happen to him. His pride was gone. He had no more self-esteem. Ivy had destroyed it totally.

Ivy finally finished shitting.&nbsp; She then grabbed some toilet roll and wiped her pale ass. While she was cleaning her behind, she was staring at Charles.&nbsp; His face was covered in her stinking wet brown shit and he stunk really really bad. 

�I think you need to wash up!!�&nbsp; she shouted at him in a disgusted tone,&nbsp; �Clean yourself with the water hose in the bath tub.&nbsp; Niow!!!!�

Charles automatically got up, went to the bath tub and cleaned himself with water.&nbsp; He only did it because she told him to. He felt like Arnold Schwarzenegger&#8217;s Terminator cyborg character in the movie Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines. He automatically does something because he is told to do it. 

Even when he was done cleaning his face in the tub,&nbsp; he started vomiting himself.&nbsp; All that shits of hers that she made him take into his mouth, was too much for him.&nbsp; He then had to clean her tub too. 

As for Ivy, she slowly walk to her bed and dropped down. She was tired and wasted. She instantly fell asleep,&nbsp; snoring even. 

As for Charles, he just put his clothes on and left her place.&nbsp; When he got on his bike and stared cycling away,&nbsp; he could think of nothing but going home. He was going to have&nbsp; a bath,&nbsp; given the physical and psychological terror Ivy had put him through. 

As he cycled past the tress,&nbsp; going down the wooded hills,&nbsp; his mind was trying to remain strong,&nbsp; like some kind of computer. 

He had never felt so inferior in his entire life.



















Chapter 32



First week of October &#8211; Friday afternoon



It was 3PM in the afternoon.&nbsp; Charles was working on his mom&#8217;s shop the whole day. He didn&#8217;t sleep the whole night but he worked the whole day as if he wasn&#8217;t tired. He even skipped going to see his friends for his lunch break. At the moment he was working on the aisle for writing equipments,&nbsp; like paper pads, pencils, pens, easers and those kind of stuff.&nbsp; As Charles was working,&nbsp; his mom approached him.

�Charles are you ok??�&nbsp; Sara asked him.

�I&#8217;m fine mom!!�&nbsp; Charles said in an annoyed tone.

�You didn&#8217;t eat the whole day. You never took your break? Is something in your mind? Are you ok sweetie??� Sara asked him in a concerned tone.

�I&#8217;m fine mom. Just have a lot in my mind, that&#8217;s all,�&nbsp; Charles responded in a &#8216;can-you-leave-me-alone&#8217; kind of tone.

�Well honey if something is bothering you, you know you can come and talk to me!!�&nbsp; Sara said to him.

Charles kept on working,&nbsp; not even looking towards his mom&#8217;s direction.&nbsp; Sara left him,&nbsp; deciding that he wanted to be alone right now. 

For Charles, as long as he kept working, he felt that he was doing something worthwhile. Working did something for his damaged ego. He felt like a soldier who kept on going stronger and stronger, regardless how tough the enemy was. As for who was the enemy: Ivy. 

When he finished work,&nbsp; he followed his mom back home.&nbsp; His mom let him spend the entire evening playing video game on their television set. Sara knew that Charles was feeling upset about something. He didn&#8217;t want to talk about it. She decided to let him have fun with the tv for tonight. Charles was playing with his PS3 for hours and hours until 3AM in Saturday morning.&nbsp; Charles was so tired that he just slept there on the lounge sofa. 

When it was Saturday morning,&nbsp; Sara woke up around 9AM.&nbsp; She cooked breakfast for herself and ate at the dining hall. She decided not to wake Charles up and ask him to come to work with her today.&nbsp; After breakfast, she went to the lounge to take a peek at him.&nbsp; He was there sleeping on the sofa.&nbsp;&nbsp; And he was sleeping without a blanket. 

Sara wasn&#8217;t going to wake him up. Instead she was just going to get dressed for work. She thought about his friend Thomas who often came to visit him at their shop. If Thomas came and asked why Charles didn&#8217;t show up for work, she would tell him that he wanted to be alone right now and that she had given her own son the day off. 

When Sara was finished dressing up,&nbsp; she left the house and got into her car,&nbsp; driving off to work.&nbsp; While she was driving on the road, she was thinking of what she could do for her son and help him out with whatever problems he was having. After all, she was his mother who loved him with all her heart.



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *********



Charles continued sleeping the whole day. He had a mixture of all sorts of dreams,&nbsp; mostly about him fighting Ivy.&nbsp; In one dream he was a police officer and she was a cat burglar he was chasing on the street.&nbsp; He had her cornered against a fence. She was angry that she had nowhere to go. Instead of arresting her, he just takes out a gun and shoots her. It felt good. 

In another dream he was a hunter, going out on a hunting expedition with Brady and the other boys. They were all dressed up like stereotypical British hunters living and hunting in sub-Saharan Africa during the days of the British Empire. But they were not hunting any animals in Africa. They were all in Constantinople&#8217;s Lot,&nbsp; hunting witches.&nbsp; As they climbed up the wooded hills, they finally reached Ivy&#8217;s mansion.&nbsp; Once they were by the mansion, they saw Ivy, Megan and Katherine dressed up like the witch from Wizard of Oz and flying around on the air in their broomsticks. Charles and the boys just fired their rifles at them,&nbsp; shooting them down instantly.&nbsp; That felt good too.&nbsp; For Charles.

Charles kept on having these type of dreams until he woke up to toe doorbell ringing.&nbsp; 

Man.&nbsp; Who the fuck can it be??&nbsp; I was having such wonderful dreams,&nbsp; Charles smiled to himself.

Right now he hated Ivy and his subconscious self was entertaining the idea of gunning her down in all her monstrous forms and him, in his heroic form.

Charles got up,&nbsp; walking all the way to the front door.&nbsp; He was a bit tired but he had enough sleep.&nbsp; He was sure that it was somewhere in the middle of the afternoon and that his mom was working in the shop,&nbsp; by herself.&nbsp; 

Charles reached the front door.&nbsp; He opened it.&nbsp; .&nbsp;&nbsp; He decided to tell whoever it was to leave him alone,&nbsp; so that he can go back to sleep and continue having these great dreams.&nbsp; He didn&#8217;t even care if it was Thomas. Right now he didn&#8217;t want to see anyone but he would feel a lot better if he told whoever it was outside the front door to their face.&nbsp; This would give him some sense of power and self-satisfaction.&nbsp;&nbsp; 

His eyes shot wide open when he saw who it was.&nbsp; 

�Can we come in??�&nbsp; Ivy asked in an upset and guilty tone.




































Chapter 33



First week of October &#8211; Saturday afternoon



Ivy was outside his house.&nbsp; She wasn&#8217;t alone.&nbsp; Megan and Katherine were with her.&nbsp; They were all dressed up in black,&nbsp; in their bad girl outfits. 

�Fancy seeing you all here!!�&nbsp; Charles commented in a tired tone.

Charles yawned,&nbsp; hoping that is comment came out in a sarcastic tone.&nbsp; He wasn&#8217;t sure what he wanted to do next.&nbsp; Or what he should do next. 

�Charles I know you&#8217;re upset about Thursday night.&nbsp; I know how I made you feel. I can still see how that is affecting you. I just want you to know that I&#8217;m really really sorry!!!�&nbsp; Ivy apologized to him in&nbsp; sad and sincere tone.

As far as Charles was concerned, she was guilty as hell and if she felt guilty now, it served her right. 

�Well I&#8217;m supposed to be your slave right.&nbsp; I mean you can do whatever that is that you want with me right,�&nbsp; Charles commented sarcastically.

Charles would rather feel sarcastic than emotional.&nbsp; 

�Hey stop being sarcastic.&nbsp; She really is sorry.&nbsp; She told us everything. She feels bad about it not because she feels guilty. She feels bad for having made you feel bad and having never taken your feelings into account,�&nbsp; Katherine shouted to him in a angry tone.

�Kate please,�&nbsp; Megan telling her friend to cool off.

�So you&#8217;re sorry. Well ok that&#8217;s cool that you come all the way here to say you&#8217;re sorry. Well to be honest with you ladies,&nbsp; I am just tired.&nbsp; I am really really tired. So Ivy if you really mean what you say and that you now care for my feelings,&nbsp; then this means that I can go back to sleep!!�&nbsp; Charles spoke in a tired tone.

Charles was about to close the front door but Ivy put her boot by the bottom of the front door.&nbsp; 

�Hey listen Charles.&nbsp; I really am sorry. You have no idea how bad I am feeling right now. I care about you. I take no joy in seeing you like this. What happened on Thursday is not going to happen again.&nbsp; I promise,�&nbsp; Ivy cried with emotion.

�Come on Charles.&nbsp; Don&#8217;t be stupid. She wants to take your relationship to a better level,� cried Megan.

�So Ivy what is it that you really want from me??�&nbsp; Charles was frustrated.

A part of him enjoyed that Ivy was apologizing to him.&nbsp; In fact he hardly called her Mistress the whole time and she didn&#8217;t get angry. 

�Charles I really want us to be friends.&nbsp; All I am asking is for your forgiveness.&nbsp; That would mean a lot to me. I promise I am going to be much more caring and much more nicer to you. You&#8217;ll be more like my boyfriend than my slave.&nbsp; I will take much better care of you. Please say you&#8217;ll forgive me!!!�&nbsp; Ivy said.

It seemed to&nbsp; Charles that she was now the one who was going to be begging him.

�What if I don&#8217;t??�&nbsp; Charles was being cocky and arrogant.

He puts his arms on his chest,&nbsp; being snug and defiant. 

Ivy just looked at him.&nbsp; She looked upset.&nbsp; Then she looked angry. 

�Charles are you asking me to drop down on my knees and beg you for forgiveness??�&nbsp; Ivy asked him.

The way she asked him seemed more like an interrogation than an actual question.

�Well if you want to,&nbsp; that is your choice!!�&nbsp; Charles told her in a cocky tone.

Charles would have liked it if she went down on her knees, kissed his legs and asked him to forgive him,&nbsp; but he knew that would put him in the same situation as her and lessen her burden of guilt.&nbsp; Humiliating her would backfire.&nbsp; He was sure of that. He knew what her character was like. If he humiliated her, that would make them even. She would have won. All he wanted was for her to go away and that he ought to have nothing to do with her.&nbsp; 

�Look!! If I forgive you,&nbsp; will you leave me alone??&nbsp; Will you forget about me??�&nbsp; Charles asked.

Ivy just stared at him.&nbsp; She no longer looked sad.&nbsp; She looked furious. 

�Charles I really like having you as a part of my life.&nbsp; I just want you to know that I can be a very jealous person.&nbsp; But just remember this. What I did to you on Thursday was nothing compared to what you did to me seven years ago.&nbsp;&nbsp; You nearly killed me. For that you get to become my personal slave. You know what that means. I actually don&#8217;t have to feel bad about the way I treat you. In fact I have the right to do whatever I want with you. You should be glad I even came today, asking you to even forgive me but why bother!!�&nbsp; Ivy spoke to him in an angry tone.

Ivy walked away from the front door.&nbsp; Megan and Katherine followed suit.&nbsp; Something told Charles that he may have made matters far worst. After all he nearly killed her seven years ago before she did those humiliating and degrading things to him two nights ago.&nbsp; That really was no comparison. 

�Hey Ivy wait!!&nbsp; Look I am just upset and tired and��&nbsp; Charles spoke,&nbsp; trying to ease up the tension building up between them.

Ivy turned around,&nbsp; looking cocky and arrogant.

�I don&#8217;t give a shit about your excuses alright. You feeling bad that I bruise up that stupid ego of yours. You know what.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t care.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t care anymore. I can do far worse than that. You know what I&#8217;m talking about. Would you want the town to know the truth huh? Is that the price of that damn ego of yours, you stupid son of a bitch,�&nbsp; Ivy shouted angrily towards Charles.

�Oh come on now!!�&nbsp; Charles shot back in defence.

�If you were wondering about whether I was going to go on my knees and kiss your feet and beg you take me back in, you have another thing coming.&nbsp; You should have just forgiven me and invite us all in for tea and letting me make it up to you. Now I understand that you don&#8217;t want my apologies. I sometimes think that you still think of me, or the three of us, as your enemies.&nbsp; Well if this is how it&#8217;s going to be Charles,&nbsp; then you better watch that pale ass of yours!!�&nbsp; Ivy warned him in a threatening tone.

Ivy and the two girls looked angrily towards Charles,&nbsp; and then walked away. 

�And that pale ass of yours made a great candle stick holder anyways!!�&nbsp; chuckled Megan.

All three girls cruelly laughed, with Megan and Ivy giving each other high-fives. 

Charles wasn&#8217;t sure if he should run after her and convince her otherwise. After all she really meant it when she said she was sorry and that perhaps it would be better if he let her make it up to him.

�Ivy??&nbsp; Please wait!!�&nbsp; Charles cried.

Charles then ran after Ivy and the two other girls.&nbsp; He hoped she would not do anything like expose their secret relationship to the rest of the town.&nbsp;&nbsp; Just when he was about to reach her and put a hand on her shoulder,&nbsp; Ivy jerked her elbow very hard and very fast against his stomach,&nbsp; then quickly turned around to face him and kick him on the groins.&nbsp; Charles was caught off guard. He automatically put his hands on his balls,&nbsp; as well as dropping down to the solid ground on his knees. 

�OOOWWW!!!!!�&nbsp; Charles groaned in pain.

�Understand this you asshole.&nbsp; I am letting you go scot free.&nbsp; For today. You wanna rest, go home and rest. You want to be left alone,&nbsp; I am going to leave you alone. For today. I am still your Mistress and if your Mistress tells you she is sorry, she really is sorry and not some cold-hearted bitch all the time. The smartest thing for you would have been to brush aside your own stupid male ego and forgive me and let us all inside your house. And to forgive me without giving me your stupid conditions. I guess you still want me to be nasty to you because if you had forgiven me just now,&nbsp; I was going to make you more important in my life. I guess there is no room for that now.&nbsp; I suggest you go back home and get some real good rest&nbsp; you sure as hell are going to need it!!�&nbsp; warned Ivy, in a cold and hissing tone.

As Charles was on the floor,&nbsp; trying to comfort his bruised-up stomach,&nbsp; he could do nothing but watch all three girls walk away. He had changed Ivy from being his Mistress to being his enemy. 

�And one last thing!!&nbsp; Throwing up at you and urinating and shitting on you is pancakes compared to seven years.&nbsp; I could have died!!�&nbsp; Ivy reminded him,&nbsp; before all three girls vanished from his sight. 

�What am I going to do now??�&nbsp; Charles whispered to himself in a panicking tone.























Chapter 34



Second week of October &#8211; Wednesday afternoon



Charles was having lunch with Brady and company at The Elvis.&nbsp; He and the guys were talking about their usual day at work and other things they did.&nbsp; Charles tried his best trying to hide his feelings about Thursday and Saturday from last week.&nbsp; Unfortunately because he had such good caring friends, they could see something was troubling him. He lied about what was bothering him,&nbsp; lying that a friend of his from Manchester was having serious trouble with the police and how bad he feels that he could not be there for his mate. 

�Well to be honest Charles. He shouldn&#8217;t have stolen that car! The law is the law!!&nbsp; He brought it on himself!!�&nbsp; Alex commented.

�Well he is still my friend!!�&nbsp; Charles making his false comment.

Charles dug into his fries,&nbsp; eating and thinking about Ivy. He had not seen her since Saturday. She never even sent him any text messages.&nbsp;&nbsp; He prayed that she never decides to send videos of his tattoos to anyone in town or telling the truth that he vowed to be the town outcast&#8217;s slave. 

�Charles man, don&#8217;t let that bottle you up!!&nbsp; Let it go!!&nbsp; He is not worth it. If this guy who was supposedly your friend was a thief,&nbsp; he is not your friend from the beginning. He is not a good character. Forget him. Your real friends would think about their actions before doing something like this!!�&nbsp; Brady remarked.

�Well Brade,&nbsp; many city kids do stuff like this all the time.&nbsp; Stealing is no big thing to them!!�&nbsp; commented Alex. 

�Yeah but still.&nbsp; Stealing is a serious criminal offence!!� remarked Pete.

�Yeah you guys are right!!&nbsp; This guy is not something worth worrying over,�&nbsp; Charles said,&nbsp; making a sighing sound.

Brady grabbed his hamburger and took a chunk out of it.&nbsp; The way Brady was eating,&nbsp; Charles could tell that he was enjoying his food very much. 

�Charles you ever going back to the big city??� asked Alex.

�Well I never thought about it!&nbsp; I supposed maybe one day I might,�&nbsp; Charles responded. 

�Good &#8216;cos if you are,&nbsp; take me with you,�&nbsp; Alex said.

�That is our Alex, always wanting to find an excuse to run away from our peaceful little town,�&nbsp; chuckled Pete.

Charles, Bray and Thomas broke out into small laughter at Pete&#8217;s joke.&nbsp; 

�I sometimes think he doesn&#8217;t love us anymore.&nbsp; That is why he wants to leave us,�&nbsp; Pete said.

Pete looked at Charles,&nbsp; winking his left eye.&nbsp; He then looked back at Alex.

�Ain&#8217;t that right Alex,�&nbsp; Pete said to Alex.

�Oh I will always love you guys,�&nbsp; Alex joked back.

Alex chuckled warm-heartedly. 

�Any of you guys have girlfriends??� Charles asked,&nbsp; still laughing. 

�Well everyone is seeing someone except me!!� commented Alex.

�I can understand now why you wanna leave town,�&nbsp; Charles said,&nbsp; in a joking tone.

As far as Charles knew none of his friends had girlfriends.&nbsp; This was something they would not keep from each other.&nbsp; Unless they were dating girls like Megan or Katherine or girls like that,&nbsp; behind their friends&#8217; backs. 

�Hey since Halloween is not so far away,&nbsp; I was just wondering about something,�&nbsp; said Charles.

�And what is that?�&nbsp; Brady was curious.

�Are there any haunted places here in Constantinople&#8217;s Lot??� asked Charles.

�Oh there are some.&nbsp; Why you ask?? You want to go there during Halloween.&nbsp; You want to see something really scary instead for celebrating it by going to our usual place for ghost story-telling??�&nbsp; said Pete.

�Maybe!!�&nbsp; Charles said.

�Oh I would tell you about the haunted places around here mate.&nbsp; But not on Halloween. I mean we were already in one scary place and look where that landed us.&nbsp; You even had to leave us afterwards,�&nbsp; joked Pete.

Pete was talking about the hill where Ivy&#8217;s mansion was. 

�Good one Alex.&nbsp; Good one!!�&nbsp; Charles joined in the joke. 

�That is our Alex!!�&nbsp; commented Brady.

�Hey that hill where you guys go to every Halloween has a name.&nbsp; It&#8217;s called Connor&#8217;s Hill.&nbsp; Do all the hills and forests have names around here?� asked Charles.

�Some but not all.&nbsp; I mean take Ivy.&nbsp; The beach near that hill where her house is,&nbsp; is known around here as The Wailing Beach,&nbsp; since people sometimes report hearing ghost sounds.&nbsp; But as far as I am concerned,&nbsp; they are just stories.&nbsp; As for the hill and the woods leading up to that trek,&nbsp; they have no names.&nbsp; That rich guy who left Ivy&#8217;s and Megan&#8217;s and Katherine&#8217;s mom with paid the town mayor many many decades ago to not give that hill any name and keeping it anonymous.&nbsp; Same goes for those woods too!!�&nbsp; Brady commented.

�Why??� asked Charles.

�He did not want anyone coming to look for him or that if someone wanted to visit every inch of Constantinople&#8217;s Lot,&nbsp; he wouldn&#8217;t find it on any local map.&nbsp; The rich bastard just wanted to be left alone. I mean he was extremely generous and gave the town a lot of financial contributions but the only guests he normally got were other rich strangers who would drive into our town. Well they leave us alone and we leave them alone,&nbsp; as mom used to say. Well they stopped coming since he died. That&#8217;s history!!�&nbsp; Brady said.

�But Ivy and the bitches are still here.&nbsp; The witches are here to stay,�&nbsp; Alex interjected in a humorous way.

Everyone broke out in laughter.&nbsp; 

�Man Al you always know how to liven up history!!�&nbsp; commented Brady.

�Alex,&nbsp; our joker!!�&nbsp; Thomas laughed while shaking his head.

As everyone kept on laughing,&nbsp; Alex looked towards the direction of the diner&#8217;s front door.&nbsp; He stopped laughing and started looking a bit more serious.&nbsp; Charles heard someone coming through the entrance.&nbsp; 

�You guys are not gonna believe this!!�&nbsp; Alex said in a shocked tone.

�Who just walked through the front door??�&nbsp; asked Pete.

They all knew that Alex was staring towards the front door.&nbsp; Charles and the others then started looking towards the same direction.&nbsp; They turned to see who it was that walked through the entrance. Charles was shocked,&nbsp; and so were Brady, Pete and Thomas. 

It was three bad girls: Ivy, Megan and Katherine.&nbsp; 












































Chapter 35




Ivy and the two other girls were walking around,&nbsp; talking amongst themselves and looking at the rows of tables,&nbsp; probably discussing where they&#8217;re going to sit down and eat.&nbsp;&nbsp; The girls then headed for the diner counter.&nbsp; They were oblivious to the existence of Charles and his friends,&nbsp; who were sat down. 

�Hey maybe we should get out of here!!�&nbsp; suggested Charles in&nbsp; low monotone.

�Hang on a sec.&nbsp; This could be interesting!!�&nbsp; Alex was being a curious busybody.

�For once I agree with Alex!!�&nbsp; Pete supporting his friend.

�Do you think they&#8217;ll see us??�&nbsp; Thomas was curious in an excited way.

Charles did not want Ivy to see him.&nbsp;&nbsp; He wasn&#8217;t comfortable being in the same diner as she was.&nbsp; He was asking himself so many questions. What was she doing here? Why would they come to a diner like this? Ha she forgotten about me? Has she decided that I am not worth her time? Is she still mad at me? Is she going to get even with me because of what happened on Saturday?

�Guys listen. I think I&#8217;m going to go back to work. I&#8217;ll see you guys later!!�&nbsp; Charles spoke as if he was in a hurry to get away.

�What&#8217;s the hurry Charles. It&#8217;s not everyday that you get to see the town bitches!!�&nbsp; commented Pete.

Alex then smirked at Charles.

�I know why you want to go!!&nbsp; You are scared of them!!&nbsp; You are scared of these bitches!!�&nbsp; Alex laughed.

�Am not!!�&nbsp; Charles defending himself in low monotone.

He was scared that they would see him.&nbsp; 

�Scaredycat!! Scaredycat!!�&nbsp; Alex making fun of Charles.

�Hey Charles I know they are nasty bitches but there are five of us.&nbsp; They are not going to try anything stupid inside a diner.&nbsp; Relax man. They may be bitches but they&#8217;re not that stupid!!�&nbsp; Brady tried assuring Charles.&nbsp; 

Charles knew that he better play along before he annoys his friends too.&nbsp; And raise suspicions from them as well. 

�Ok. I&#8217;ll just sit down here until you get bored with these bitches,�&nbsp; Charles sighed sarcastically.

�That&#8217;s my man!!�&nbsp; Brady patted Charles at the back.

Ivy, Megan and Katherine ordered their food and five minutes later,&nbsp; the woman at the counter gave them their orders on a tray, as well as their change. Ivy and the girls were then walking around,&nbsp; carrying their food trays.&nbsp; 

Charles just stared at his friends, while they continued staring at the three bad girls. They were just looking and giggling. Charles was the only one ho was not laughing. 

Jesus guys,&nbsp; why look for trouble when it&#8217;s not looking for you,&nbsp; Charles thought. 

Charles was not prepared for what was about to come next.

�Burn in Hell you fucking gypsy bitches!!�&nbsp; screamed Pete. 

�Quick guys!!&nbsp; Scram!!�&nbsp; Brady cried to all of them.

Before Charles realized it,&nbsp; the other four guys started getting up.&nbsp; Charles quickly got up too.&nbsp; They all started running towards the front entrance,&nbsp; never looking back.&nbsp;&nbsp; Once they were outside The Elvis,&nbsp; they quickly ran to their bikes,&nbsp; got on them and cycled as far away as possible from The Elvis.

Their wheels hit the main road.&nbsp; All five of them were cycling now.&nbsp; The wind was blowing on their faces.&nbsp; Aside form Charles,&nbsp; all the others were howling at the wind,&nbsp; making loud laughter.&nbsp; 

Charles couldn&#8217;t believe it.&nbsp; The last thing he remembered was getting ion his bike and following after his friends.&nbsp; Before that, all of them getting out of the diner.&nbsp; Before that,&nbsp; all of them quickly getting up from their tables and running for the entrance.&nbsp;&nbsp; And before that,&nbsp; Pete shouting towards Ivy and the two other girls. 

They all kept on cycling until they all stopped somewhere by the side of the road,&nbsp; in the middle of a town highway. 

Charles was really furious.&nbsp; With Pete.

�Are you fucking crazy!!�&nbsp; Charles screamed at him.

The four boys were looking at each other,&nbsp; laughing and mumbling amongst themselves.&nbsp; Charles knew that they were so happy with what happened just now that they were not paying attention to Charles.&nbsp; 

They&#8217;re not listening to me.&nbsp; They&#8217;re in their own world&nbsp;&nbsp; Charles thought. 

�Man Pete,&nbsp; that was awesome!!�&nbsp; Alex laughed really loud,&nbsp; shaking his head.

�You&#8217;re the man Pete!! You&#8217;re the man!!�&nbsp; Thomas complimented.

�Thank you. Thank you,�&nbsp; Pete making a bowing down gesture to his friends. 

Pete behaved as if he had just made a performance while the others behaved like excited spectators. 

�Do you think they saw us??� asked Thomas.

�Who knows and who cares!!&nbsp; Maybe that will be the last time they will come to any of our diners!!�&nbsp; Alex rudely interjected.

�I think they might have!!�&nbsp; Brady answering Thomas&#8217;s question.

�So what if they saw us!!&nbsp; Fuck &#8216;em.&nbsp; I am not scared of them. Why the hell are we avoiding them anyways??�&nbsp; Pete angrily commented.

�Because they know martial arts.&nbsp; Or at least Ivy does. You forgot that she kicked some guys&#8217; asses before. Guys we know from our school!!�&nbsp; Brady said.

�Old school.&nbsp; You guys are not students there anymore. Remember,�&nbsp; Charles purposely lightening up the situation.

He was hoping that Ivy didn&#8217;t see them.&nbsp; Or at least see him.&nbsp; He was afraid for himself. What if Ivy saw all their faces while they ran out the door? 

Charles&#8217;s heart was beating very fast. He was angry with Pete for having shouted at them. By shouting at them,&nbsp; saying bad things to them, he would have obviously caught their attention. 

Charles couldn&#8217;t help bottling up this feeling anymore.

�So if they saw us,&nbsp; that means they could come after us!!�&nbsp; commented Charles.

�And??&nbsp; Look man. If they hurt one of us,&nbsp; the rest of us will retaliate. This is not like seven years ago when we were kids. Kids our age settle differences and problems amongst ourselves. We know that and that bitch Ivy knows that. Adults here don&#8217;t care what teenies like us do amongst ourselves. They only intervene with little kids and we are not little kids anymore!!�&nbsp; Pete commented in an angry tone.

It seemed to Charles that Pete was being reckless and that he was actually enjoying this.&nbsp; That he was purposely provoking Ivy and the girls,&nbsp; hoping to create and stir up trouble. 

�Not if we did to her what we did when we were little kids Pete. We can&#8217;t throw her off a cliff. We would be in deep trouble,�&nbsp; Brady said.

�Look mate. The point is this. When teens like us have problems, we don&#8217;t go and complain to the police. Only kids and adults do that around here. If anyone from our class gets beaten up by someone else from our class,&nbsp; there is no way in hell he is going to tell mom and dad what had just happened. If he does, no chick in this town will ever date him.&nbsp; Or go out with him,�&nbsp; Pete lectured.

While all four boys were arguing amongst themselves,&nbsp; Charles was only thinking about one thing.&nbsp; What if Ivy saw me? 
































Chapter 36



It was 8PM in the evening.&nbsp; Charles and his mom were having dinner at the dining hall.&nbsp; She cooked for them buttered roast chicken with sliced potatoes, beans, apple cider and some loaves of bread.&nbsp;&nbsp; And some vegetables too.&nbsp; 

�How was your day today hun??�&nbsp; Sara asked.

Charles looked at his mom.&nbsp; He wasn&#8217;t sure what he was going to tell her.&nbsp; 

�Had lunch with the boys mom.&nbsp; At The Elvis,�&nbsp; Charles said.

�Well it seemed to me like you had a good time.&nbsp; I mean&nbsp; you came back from lunch much longer than usual!!�&nbsp; Sara chuckled.

Charles sighed.&nbsp; He knew his mom was not mad at him but just curious why he took much longer time to get back to work.&nbsp; 

�Told the guys I got to get back to work but Pete was telling his story and it was a long story,�&nbsp; Charles lied.

�Well I don&#8217;t care how long you take your break,&nbsp; just as long as you&#8217;re safe,� Sara smiled.

Charles used his fork and knife and cut himself some more pieces of chicken,&nbsp; from the sliced-off drumstick he was eating on his plate.&nbsp; Once he had his chicken piece on his fork,&nbsp; he dipped it on his ketchup sauce spread on his plate,&nbsp; and then ate it.&nbsp; He savoured the taste of the chicken in his mouth. 

Mom is the best cook,&nbsp; Charles always thought.

When dinner was over,&nbsp; Charles went up to his bedroom.&nbsp; Sara finished cleaning up in the kitchen,&nbsp; and then occupied the lounge.&nbsp; She often watched a lot of TV shows during the evening,&nbsp; especially from channels like BBC1 or ITV1.&nbsp; 

When Charles was in his bedroom,&nbsp; he went online.&nbsp; He was chatting with his friends from Manchester.&nbsp; He told them about what happened at The Elvis today.&nbsp; However,&nbsp; just like everyone else,&nbsp; they didn&#8217;t know about the secret relationship between &#8216;Slave Charles &amp; Mistress Ivy&#8217;. 

Norman:
I am confused. I thought u didn&#8217;t see her anymore or that u been avoiding her?

Jim:
She does not know who u r right?

Charles:
No I don&#8217;t think so. I mean I stopped hanging out with her and she never bothered me ever since but one of my friends yelled at her and the other girls,&nbsp; saying Burn in Hell u fucking gypsy bitches. That was how I remembered it. Then we scrammed. 

Jim:
U think she saw u?

Charles: I don&#8217;t know Jim. I don&#8217;t know

Norman:
Hey if she saw u, u know what that means. She is going to look for all of u guys. She might get her girl gang to come, kidnap u all, tie u up and turn u all into their sex slaves LOL

Jim:
Norman?

Charles:
LOL

Charles was pretending to find Norma&#8217;s joke funny,&nbsp; as he knew that Norman had no idea that Ivy was indeed capable of such stuff.&nbsp; Actually he knew from first-hand experience that she was far worse than that.

Norman:
So what if she and any of the other bitches saw u? There are 5 of u and 3 of them. Plus the town will be on your side right. I mean they are outcasts who just luckily got rich. 

Jim:
Well I don&#8217;t know what she is capable of but just be careful mate. U have no idea what people are capable of. U said she is a gypsy. That makes it even worse mate. U don&#8217;t wanna mess with gypsies,&nbsp; especially if they know it was u messing with them. 

Norman:
Jim&#8217;s right dude. She is going to come over there, hide under your bed and when u go 2 sleep, she is gonna cum up and rape u

Charles:
LOL
Jim:
Your imagination Norman. But if what u said about her was true, then I suggest u b on your guard. 

Charles shook his head.&nbsp; His old city classmates from Manchester were so much like his old town friends in Constantinople&#8217;s Lot.&nbsp; Norman was like the Manchester equivalent of Alex. Jim was the Manchester equivalent of Brady.&nbsp; The first two were comedians and the latter two were the caring friends who looked out for you,&nbsp; knowing what is in your best interests.

Before Charles was going to continue chatting with his friends online,&nbsp; he heard a knock on his bedroom door.

KNOCK KNOCK

�Come in!!�&nbsp; Charles said.

Sara opened his bedroom door.&nbsp; She was smiling at her son.&nbsp; 

�Honey listen.&nbsp; Can you turn off your computer for a while and come downstairs.&nbsp; Come down to the lounge,�&nbsp; Sara told him.

�Ok mom!!�&nbsp; Charles responded.

Charles looked at his PC,&nbsp; looking at what time it was.&nbsp; It was already 10PM.&nbsp; 

�I&#8217;ll be downstairs mom.&nbsp; I am just going to shut off my PC,� he told her.

Sara walked away from his bedroom doorway.&nbsp; Charles logged off his PC.&nbsp; He then went down the stairs,&nbsp; heading straight to the lounge.&nbsp;&nbsp; When he went to the lounge,&nbsp; he was shocked.&nbsp;&nbsp; 

Ivy was sat down at the main sofa,&nbsp; sipping a cup of tea.

�Hi Charles,�&nbsp; Ivy smiled at him.

�Eva is going to be spending the night with us.&nbsp; Her parents won&#8217;t be coming home tonight and she was afraid that she was going to be all alone. She came here and I said that she can spend the night here with us!!�&nbsp; Sara said.

Charles panicked.









Chapter 37




Charles looked at Ivy.&nbsp; She was sat down,&nbsp; looking like an angel.&nbsp; 

�That&#8217;s great,�&nbsp; Charles trying his best to fake his smile.

�Now since Eva is going to be here with us,&nbsp; how about we all spend our time tonight together in this room.&nbsp; I was thinking that we can all watch a film or something,�&nbsp; Sara suggested.

�That sounds like a splendid idea Sara.&nbsp; I really hope that I am not intruding on you guys,�&nbsp; Ivy complimenting Sara.

�Nonsense Eva. You are like family to us. We are glad to have you with us actually.&nbsp; Isn&#8217;t that right Charles!!�&nbsp; Sara speaking for the two of them.

�Absolutely mom,�&nbsp; Charles trying his best to fake his smile. 

Sara went over to the Blue-Ray shelf,&nbsp; looking at all the films they can watch together.&nbsp; 

�Just wondering what film we can all watch together,�&nbsp; Sara focusing on her film collection.

Ivy was smiling at Charles for about 30 seconds until, her facial expression changed.&nbsp; She looked really bitter,&nbsp; just like that gypsy girl in the Stephen Kings movie Thinner.&nbsp; In the movie, the fat lawyer (protagonist) was talking to his colleague up on a room,&nbsp; while looking out the window.&nbsp; The colleague gave the fat lawyer a coin and told the fat lawyer to give it to the gypsy girl and tell her to raise her skirt. When the fat lawyer went down the building and headed straight for his car, the gypsy girl approached him. She smiled at him, started dancing erotically for him,&nbsp;&nbsp; winked her eye,&nbsp; and then raised her skirt up. The fat lawyer was shocked and scared at the same time. He thought she must have some supernatural powers and overheard them talking about her. After dancing, she then looked angry and furiously at him,&nbsp; then spitting in front of him. 

Ivy was really scaring Charles,&nbsp; especially when she spelled the words out from her lips without making any sounds �You are dead�.&nbsp; He knew why she was here and why she was now threatening him.&nbsp; It was because of what happened earlier at The Elvis. 

�Have any of you guys watched The Portrait of Dorian Gray??�&nbsp; asked Sara.

Sara&#8217;s eyes were focused on the Blue Ray discs.&nbsp; Charles and Ivy were staring at each other.&nbsp; Ivy&#8217;s blue eyes were intimidating Charles&#8217;s green eyes. 

�Hey mom can I have a word with Ivy for a while?� asked Charles.

Charles wanted to clarify things with Ivy,&nbsp; before allowing things to get worse. 

�Sure hun,�&nbsp; Sara said.

Charles looked at Ivy,&nbsp; pointing towards the direction of the hallway outside the lounge.&nbsp; Ivy got up ad put her cup down.&nbsp; Ivy followed Charles towards the outside hall.&nbsp; Charles made sure that they far away from the lounge&#8217;s doorway.&nbsp; That they were out of his mom&#8217;s hearing range.

Ivy crossed her arms over her chest,&nbsp; looking bitterly towards Charles.&nbsp; Charles was scared,&nbsp; intimidated&nbsp; and worried.

�Listen I didn&#8217;t know they were going to try something like that.&nbsp; They saw you and I said I wanted to leave but they forced me to stay. Trust me. I am as mad with them as you are!!�&nbsp; Charles stuttered.

Ivy continued glaring at him.

�Oh come on.&nbsp; What did you expect me to do? I told them that we should go. I was surprised one of them was going to try something like that in a diner. I was caught off guard. I have nothing to do with it. You can&#8217;t be mad at me for something I didn&#8217;t do and have no control over,�&nbsp; Charles cried.

�I know you didn&#8217;t do it. I recognize Pete&#8217;s disgusting voice from anywhere. Your friends.&nbsp; A bunch of cowards. They call you names and then run away. Too chicken to stay and look us in the face. You know if we really were witches, we wouldn&#8217;t have out up with their shit. In fact I would have done something about that. I would have turned all your ugly friends into bugs. Then I will let Megan and Kate have fun with them,&nbsp; like step on them,�&nbsp; Ivy spoke in a malicious wicked tone. 

�Please don&#8217;t talk like that to me,�&nbsp; Charles begged.

�I can talk to you anyway I want. Would you want Sara to know who you really are,�&nbsp; Ivy taunted him.

Charles gulped,&nbsp; looking and sounding scared in front of Ivy. 

�Please don&#8217;t do this,�&nbsp; Charles begged.

�Please don&#8217;t do this,�&nbsp; Ivy mimicking Charles.

�Why are you being so nasty?? You know I never did anything to you since I got back to this town. I don&#8217;t deserve this treatment. Why can&#8217;t we be just friends,�&nbsp; Charles whined.

Ivy moved forward,&nbsp; quickly slipping her hands underneath his shirt.&nbsp; She touched his nipple rings.&nbsp; She smiled wickedly at him.

�Has Sara seen these yet. Does she even know you have them on,�&nbsp; Ivy chuckled. 

Ivy twisted his right nipple&#8217;s gold ring while slightly pulling on his left&#8217;s nipple silver ring.&nbsp; Charles&#8217;s upper twitched and he made a weak cry.

�Oooww!!� Charles making a low cry.

�Ooww,�&nbsp; Ivy making fun of Charles.

Charles knew that this was Ivy&#8217;s way of saying that she owned him.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That she had power over him. 

�Look can&#8217;t you just forgive me already??�&nbsp; Charles pleaded.

�Look can&#8217;t you just forgive me already!!&nbsp; Ivy will you please stop hurting my nipples. They are sensitive,&nbsp; just like me,&nbsp;&nbsp; Charles,�&nbsp; Ivy making fun of him.

Charles groaned in helpless self-defeat. 

�Charles you know that as much as you are cute, you are also pretty intelligent enough to use your brains.&nbsp; If you know your so-called friends hate us so much,&nbsp; why do you keep on hanging out with them. Are you still going to hang out with them, after what they did today?�&nbsp; Ivy asked in a more warmer tone.

�I can&#8217;t stop hanging out with them. If I do, that will raise suspicions and..�&nbsp; Charles spoke until Ivy cut him off sharply.

��..nothing.&nbsp; Charles you&#8217;re old enough to make your own choices. If they knew about us,&nbsp; big fucking deal. They won&#8217;t hang out with you anymore or even talk to you. That is a good thing.&nbsp; That means you get to spend more time with me,�&nbsp; Ivy smiled at him.

Yeah. As your slave,&nbsp; Charles sarcastically thought.

Well at least she didn&#8217;t seemed pissed about what happened between them on Saturday. 

�I just want you to know that when I said I really like you and that I wanted to make up for what happened on Thursday,&nbsp; I really meant it.&nbsp; I know you&#8217;re still scared about Saturday and of today. I mean I kicked your balls Charles. I did remember that I warned you to watch your back. I mean I wanted you to forgive me for having been really nasty to you on Thursday night. You know I was being sincere and you could have seen it on my face. Why did you have to be so rude??� Ivy asked him politely. 

�Because I was treated like shit.&nbsp; But I was also really tired that day,�&nbsp; Charles responded. 

�I sometimes lose control but hey,&nbsp; I remembered what I did and said I was sorry.&nbsp; You know you should forgive me. After all, you are under my power. Today was a humiliating experience for me and the girls and every time some asshole tell us gypsy bitches to burn in Hell,&nbsp; it really hurts.&nbsp; A part of me wants to go teach Pete a lesson. Of course if I order you to go do it,&nbsp; your friends will all gang up on you and then they won&#8217;t be your friends anymore,�&nbsp; commented Ivy.

�I don&#8217;t understand. What were you doing in The Elvis today?&nbsp; Why are you here tonight?� Charles asked.

�Once in a while we eat at some of the diners in this town. Today seemed like a great day. To answer your second question,&nbsp; was that I wanted to see you. I mean I was planning on dropping by your house somewhere this week but I did so today because of what happened at the Diner.&nbsp; Charles is it too much to ask for you to stop hanging out with your friend? I mean if you don&#8217;t have that many friends,&nbsp; I would be happy to keep you company on your lunch breaks. I promise it won&#8217;t be our usual master-slave thing. It would be just like how it was when we first met. I mean we could be having lunch together at one of these diners and I could give you a blowjob while you are your burger,�&nbsp; Ivy teased him.

Ivy touched his balls.&nbsp; Charles felt that. 

�Hey I think mom is going to be wondering what happened to us.&nbsp; How about we go back in and watch a film,�&nbsp; Charles suggested.

Ivy looked at him as she had been rejected.&nbsp; By him. 

�You know Charles,&nbsp; you pushing me off hurts me much more than Pete calling me a gypsy bitch,�&nbsp; Ivy looked hurt.

�Ivy I�I�had no idea,�&nbsp; Charles felt guilty.

�Just to remind you are still under my power and be careful how far you push me,�&nbsp; Ivy warned him,&nbsp; then walking back into the lounge.

I have made things worst,&nbsp; Charles thought.









Chapter 38




Charles and Ivy spent the entire night watching Sherlock Holmes,&nbsp; the last one that starred Robert Downing Jr.&nbsp;&nbsp; Sara was eating strawberry ice cream on a bowl,&nbsp; while completely focused on the film.&nbsp; Charles was looking at his mom, the movie and at Ivy.&nbsp; Ivy was watching the film.&nbsp; She didn&#8217;t look at him the whole time.

�Ive..er..Eva,&nbsp; would you like a cup of tea?�&nbsp; Charles asked her.

He nearly made the mistake of calling her by her real name but managed to avoid doing that in the nick of time. 

Ivy continued watching the film,&nbsp; oblivious to him. He thought that she was listening to him but ignoring him on purpose.&nbsp;&nbsp; He hated this.&nbsp; He hated it that she was not even responding to him. 

Charles left the lounge and went down the hall,&nbsp; towards the kitchen.&nbsp; He turned on the light switch inside the kitchen.&nbsp; The kitchen light came up.&nbsp; It was bright yellowish-white neon light.&nbsp; He was glad to be out of the lounge.&nbsp; Ivy&#8217;s silent treatment was affecting him.&nbsp; It was making him wish that she would talk to him. Its effect was comparable to moments when she would openly threaten him.

Charles did not want to think about it. He took the kettle and filled it up with water,&nbsp; then set it to boil.&nbsp; While it was boiling he took a cup out and filled it with tea bag. When the water had finished boiling, he poured the kettle over his cup.&nbsp; He then took out the tea bag and poured some milk on his tea cup.&nbsp;&nbsp; He leaned by the kitchen counter,&nbsp; sipping his cup of tea. 

Charles remained in the kitchen for twenty minutes until he was done with his cup of tea and then joined his mom and Ivy in the lounge.&nbsp; When he got back and sat down,&nbsp; Sara and Ivy were still watching the movie.&nbsp; His mom didn&#8217;t know that he went to the kitchen.&nbsp; But what about Ivy?&nbsp; Did she know? Did she even care?

Charles sat and watched the rest of the movie until it was over.&nbsp; Sara got up and took out the Sherlock Holmes Blue-Ray disc and put it back in its cover.&nbsp; 

�That was great film. Best Sherlock Holmes film ever, if you ask me,�&nbsp; Sara commented.

�Yeah that was a great film,�&nbsp; Ivy responded.

Neither Ivy nor Sara yawned.&nbsp; 

�Didn&#8217;t you think it was a great film Charles,�&nbsp; Sara said.

�Oh yeah mom.&nbsp; Great film. He&#8217;s like the British version of Batman!!�&nbsp; commented Charles. 

�So anyone up for a second film?�&nbsp; Sara asked.

Charles wasn&#8217;t feeling that wide awake but he wasn&#8217;t really that tired either.&nbsp; Ivy only stared at Sara.&nbsp; She hardly looked towards Charles.

�Sure,�&nbsp; Ivy said.

Sara was looking at the films.&nbsp; 

�Eva have you seen Mamma Mia yet?�&nbsp; Sara asked..

�&#8217;Fraid not Sara,�&nbsp; Ivy said.

�Oh you should.&nbsp; It&#8217;s the number one film of all times in England.&nbsp; It even beat Titanic. I think we should put this on!!�&nbsp; Sara suggested. 

Sara put the Mamma Mia disc on and they watched it.&nbsp; Charles really didn&#8217;t like it,&nbsp; since it was a musical romance.&nbsp; The only reason he could stand this film was because no matter how boring it was for him,&nbsp; his mind was focused only on Ivy. She didn&#8217;t talk to him the whole night.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

During the middle of the movie,&nbsp; Charles slowly crept out of the lounge.&nbsp;&nbsp; He knew that his mom wouldn&#8217;t notice that he left the lounge. She is always focused on whatever film she was watching. He went up the stairs,&nbsp; straight to his bedroom.&nbsp; He closed his bedroom door and turned his PC on.&nbsp; He was glad to be away from the movie Mamma Mia.&nbsp; It was a female&#8217;s film,&nbsp; not a male&#8217;s. He went online.&nbsp; He looked at the time.&nbsp; It was nearly 3AM.&nbsp; He knew his friends must be sleeping by now,&nbsp; as they all had some part-time day jobs back in Manchester.

Charles checked his e-mail.&nbsp; He had no new e-mails. Charles sighed out and decided to watch some youtube videos instead.&nbsp; He often watched youtube videos and got distracted by them,&nbsp; especially funny ones and ones where people make all kind of comments about all kinds of issues.&nbsp; 

As Charles kept on watching,&nbsp; he was slowly feeling really tied.&nbsp; Then there was a knock on his bedroom door.

KNOCK KNOCK

�Oh shit!�&nbsp; Charles panicked.

His mom knew he was back in his room,&nbsp; doing his own thing.&nbsp; He knew that his mom wouldn&#8217;t scold him for leaving her with his own friends downstairs but that it was a sign of rudeness.&nbsp; 

Charles quickly logged off his PC,&nbsp; then&nbsp; went to his bedroom door and opened it.&nbsp; Sara was staring at her son.&nbsp; She looked more tired than angry.

�I didn&#8217;t know that you were gone from the lounge.&nbsp; In fact I thought you were tired and had gone to sleep.&nbsp; Well anyways,&nbsp; I saw Eva to the guest room. I am calling it a night. Actually it is not night. It&#8217; already Thursday morning. Lucky for you, you don&#8217;t have to come to work today.&nbsp;&nbsp; Just do me one favour. I won&#8217;t be here when you guys wake up.&nbsp; But when you do wake up,&nbsp; can you be a darling and make Eva some breakfast or brunch.&nbsp; I am sure either of you will be up somewhere in the afternoon,�&nbsp; Sara said.

Sara yawned really loud. 

�Sure mom.&nbsp; I will make Eva some brunch when I wake up,�&nbsp; Charles said.

Charles yawned too. 

�Looks like we are both tired. Better go to bed. I know I&#8217;m knackered. Good night,�&nbsp; Sara said

�Night mom,�&nbsp; Charles responded.

Charles closed the bedroom door,&nbsp; he switched off the bedroom lights and went to bed.&nbsp; He was so tired that his mind instantly wandered off to dreamland.&nbsp; 

Charles was very relaxed in his sleep,&nbsp; forgetting about Ivy.&nbsp; Charles will realize that he had let his guard,&nbsp; that is,&nbsp; when he wakes up and at the time when his mom is not home.&nbsp; When it is just him and Ivy. 
















Chapter 39



 
Second week of October &#8211; Thursday afternoon



Charles slowly blinked his eyelids.&nbsp; He was slowly waking up.&nbsp; He tried stretching his arms and legs but they felt like they were already being stretched.&nbsp; He wanted to yawn but his mouth had something on it. he also now felt pressure on his tummy,&nbsp; as if there was someone sitting on it.&nbsp; On him. 

All of a sudden he was fully awake.&nbsp; He realized something was wrong.&nbsp;&nbsp; His eyes shot wide open.&nbsp; Ivy was staring down on him.&nbsp; She was sitting on his tummy.&nbsp; He looked all over the bedroom.&nbsp; He could see that his wrists had been tied to his bed&#8217;s upper railings.&nbsp; His body was still under the blanket but he felt his legs spread wide open.&nbsp; He knew that that his ankles,&nbsp; like his wrists, had been tied to the railings.&nbsp; His mouth was gagged with cloth,&nbsp; in fact his own underwear.&nbsp; 

Ivy looked at Charles in a malicious way.&nbsp; 

�I see that my slave has woken up,�&nbsp; Ivy teased him in a cold and unsmiling tone.

Charles just groaned under his mouth gag.&nbsp; His tongue and lips were tasting his own underwear and it smelled and tasted like cloth. 

�Sara went off to work. It is just you and me Charles. We are alone. This is the day which you normally spend with me. Would you want me to take out your gag!�&nbsp; Ivy said.

Charles nodded his head eagerly.&nbsp; Ivy just looked at him coldly.&nbsp;&nbsp; Charles knew that this time was different.&nbsp; In the past he had always been afraid of Ivy,&nbsp; because of what she was capable of.&nbsp;&nbsp; This time,&nbsp; it was as personal as when she had her thrown down the river,&nbsp; but much much worse. 

�You shouldn&#8217;t have rejected me last night Charles.&nbsp; You have no idea how much you hurt me!!�&nbsp; Ivy spoke in a bitter tone. 

Charles gulped under his gagged mouth.&nbsp; The way Ivy was glaring down on him gave him the impression that she was going to kill him.&nbsp; Charles had never been this scared of Ivy before. 

�I am your Mistress and you have got the fucking balls to change the subject. Maybe that is the problem.&nbsp; Maybe I should do something about your balls Charles,�&nbsp; Ivy angrily taunted him.

Charles shook his head very very quickly.&nbsp; He was sweating and even crying at the same time. Tears rolled down his scared green eyes. 

Ivy got off him and then pushed the blanket away from his body,&nbsp; letting it all go down the bedroom floor.&nbsp; Charles could see that he completely in bondage.&nbsp; He was tied up in a spread eagled way.&nbsp; Ivy worked down on his underwear.&nbsp; She pulled it down and then started stroking his cock.

Oh my God.&nbsp; Please God don&#8217;t let this happen. Please don&#8217;t let her do this to me,&nbsp; Charles panicked in his mind.

Ivy then squeezed his balls really tightly.&nbsp; Charles groaned and moaned at the same time.&nbsp; His body shook from this physical treatment.&nbsp;&nbsp; He really felt extremely uncomfortable.&nbsp; Ivy had Charles by the balls. 

�You guys like your balls don&#8217;t you!!�&nbsp; Ivy taunted him.

Charles continued staring at her with fear.

�I said don&#8217;t you!!�&nbsp; Ivy screamed at him.

She squeezed his balls a lot harder.&nbsp; He groaned and moaned under his ball gag much louder now.&nbsp; Not loud enough that anyone can hear him.&nbsp; He couldn&#8217;t scream under his mouth gag. His body shook from two different treatments being done to him at the same time:&nbsp; being made to feel both pleasure and&nbsp; pain. It was more pain than pleasure.

Charles nodded his head.&nbsp; 

�Now why don&#8217;t you be a good boy and just lay down here. We got all day together, that is, until your mom gets back from work,� Ivy taunted him wickedly.

Ivy got off the bed and walked out of his bedroom.&nbsp;&nbsp; Charles was breathing heavily under his bondage and mouth gag. Five minutes later,&nbsp; she came back to the bedroom.&nbsp; She came back with something else.&nbsp; Something in her hand.&nbsp; Charles&#8217;s eyes shot really wide open.

Oh God.&nbsp; Oh no.&nbsp; No way. Please God let this be a dream.&nbsp; Please let me wake up.&nbsp; Please don&#8217;t let this happen to me,&nbsp; Charles panicked.

Charles made louder groaning and moaning sounds under his mouth gag,&nbsp; shaking his head frantically.

Ivy was holding a large kitchen knife.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ivy then slowly walked towards him,&nbsp; smiling more wickedly than ever.&nbsp; Charles continued crying.&nbsp; More tears were rolling down. 

How can she do this to me???&nbsp; Charles continued panicking.

�What do I have here Charles.&nbsp; You know what this is,&nbsp; don&#8217;t you,�&nbsp; Ivy mockingly teased him.

Charles kept on breathing harder and harder under his mouth gag.&nbsp; He looked at her and shook his head.&nbsp; Ivy then came and sat next down to his tied-up body on the bed.&nbsp; 

�You know when you pushed me yesterday,&nbsp; I got the impression that it wasn&#8217;t me that you didn&#8217;t like. I means I am a beautiful young woman. Now what young man in his right mind would reject a beautiful young woman.&nbsp; Oh there is such a man.&nbsp; Charles I know your secret. Charles, you are gay.&nbsp; Oh you are gay,&nbsp; am I right,�&nbsp; Ivy taunted him.

Charles shook his head but this time he looked more angry than scared.&nbsp; He didn&#8217;t like being called gay and was openly homophobic,&nbsp; like many of his guy friends.

�So you are not gay. If you are not gay, then why did you reject me. Oh now I really know why. It is because you feel no sexual attraction towards me whatsoever. Charles I&#8217;m really going to say this, because I want answers to why my feelings had been hurt last night. Charles, you are a eunuch. You are a eunuch who still has his balls on.&nbsp; But not to worry my eunuch friend,&nbsp; I am going to help rectify that. I am going to correct the appearance of your physical anatomy,�&nbsp; Ivy teased him maliciously.

Charles shook his head.&nbsp; He changed from being angry to being scared again.&nbsp; Really really scared.&nbsp;&nbsp; Ivy&#8217;s facial expression changed,&nbsp; from being a malicious tease to that of someone cold.&nbsp; 

Charles panicked as he saw Ivy raised the knife over his exposed balls. 

�Say good bye to this physical mistake Charles,�&nbsp; Ivy coldly spoke to him.

Charles feared the inevitable.&nbsp; He closed his eyes,&nbsp; hearing his own heart beating really really fast.&nbsp; He tried shutting his mind,&nbsp; fearing losing his balls at any moment.

Charles was psychologically in his own mind&#8217;s state if fear.&nbsp; His thoughts were racing to how he took having genitals for granted,&nbsp; and that it was going to come to an end,&nbsp; in his most horrifying experience.&nbsp;&nbsp; Then he heard the sound of the knife.&nbsp; Cutting through something.&nbsp;&nbsp; 

Let this be one bad dream,&nbsp; Charles begged. 

As he closed his eyes,&nbsp; tears continued seeping through his shut eyelids. 

Then he felt a slap on his face.

SLAP

Charles instantly blinked his eyes.&nbsp;&nbsp; Ivy was sat down next to him,&nbsp; smiling at him very wickedly. 

�You are such a bad boy you know that,�&nbsp; Ivy teased him.

Ivy&#8217;s voice sounded distant and his heart beating dominated his ear drums. 

�Did you really think I was going to cut off your balls??�
Ivy asked him.

He asked himself if he heard her right.&nbsp; 

Ivy grabbed his balls really tight and he jerked.&nbsp; He still had his balls. She did not cut them off.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He looked down towards where his legs were.&nbsp; The knife was not between his legs.&nbsp; The knife was next to his waist.&nbsp; 

Thank you God,&nbsp; Charles was grateful.

Charles then realized that his cock felt wet.&nbsp; He had wet his bed.&nbsp; He peed,&nbsp; out of fear.

�You made your bed dirty Charles.&nbsp; How are you going to explain this to your mom??�&nbsp; Ivy asked him in a teasing way.

Ivy then went over to where his face was and took out his mouth gag.&nbsp; Charles coughed a bit.&nbsp; His throat felt dry,&nbsp; from both being gagged and being put in a state of fear.

�Thank you!!&nbsp; Thank you�..for not cutting off my private parts off!!�&nbsp; Charles spoke in a weak monotone.

Charles was grateful that Ivy spared him the fate of being castrated.&nbsp; Being castrated was far worse than being humiliated.

�Are you thirsty??�&nbsp; Ivy asked him,&nbsp; smilingly.

Charles nodded his head eagerly.

�Yes please.&nbsp; Please give me some water to drink!!�&nbsp; Charles begged. 

�I will give you something to drink alright!!�&nbsp; Ivy said.

Ivy took out her pants and then her under wear.&nbsp; She then squatted over Charles&#8217;s face.

�Open your mouth slave.&nbsp; Your Mistress is going to quench your thirst!!�&nbsp; she ordered.

Charles opened his mouth,&nbsp; knowing that she was going to make him drink her piss.&nbsp; Ivy peed in his mouth,&nbsp; making his swallow and taste her salty urine. Ivy laughed in a kinky way.

�I can always count on that mouth of yours whenever nature calls,�&nbsp; Ivy commented.

After pissing into his mouth,&nbsp; she pushed her cunt towards his face,&nbsp; making him move his tongue on her cunt.&nbsp; After ten minutes Ivy had an orgasm,&nbsp; cumming into his mouth and face.&nbsp; When she was done cumming and had enough of his tongue being used to pleasure her cunt,&nbsp; she then used his short Blond hair to wipe her cum stain on her cunt.

Ivy untied Charles and let him lay down five minutes in his bed.&nbsp; After the five minutes was over, they went downstairs into the kitchen where he cooked them brunch.&nbsp; They ate brunch for like half-an-hour.&nbsp; After brunch, she made them have sex again. They had sex in his bedroom. She would make him kiss and suckle on her nipples while at the same time sucking on his but also using her lips to pull on his nipple rings and even use her fingers to twist and pull on them. 

There was a time when she had him tied up again in a spread eagled manner, but faced down this time.&nbsp; She also gagged his mouth again so that he could not scream very loud,&nbsp; in case someone nearby heard what was going on here. Once he was tied face down,&nbsp; she would go down the kitchen,. Take a spoon, come back it his room again and shove the end of the spoon up his ass. His body jerked,&nbsp; making his moan under his mouth gag. She used the end of the spoon as a dildo up his sensitive pale ass.&nbsp; This time when he felt both pleasure and pain, it felt more pleasure than pain. 

�You like taking it up the ass,&nbsp; don&#8217;t you Charles!!�&nbsp; Ivy taunted him.

Charles just moaned.

�I said, don&#8217;t you,!!�&nbsp; Ivy taunted him louder.

She shoved the end of the spoon much deeper,&nbsp; causing him to start cumming on his own bed.&nbsp;&nbsp; Charles nodded his head,&nbsp; answering Ivy&#8217;s question.&nbsp; He knew this was the answer she wanted to hear.&nbsp; A part of him did like having Ivy shoving the spoon up his ass.&nbsp; 

�You dirty little boy. You wet your bed again. You really are enjoying this,&nbsp; aren&#8217;t you.&nbsp; I guess this is why you are my slave!!&nbsp; Glad that I didn&#8217;t cut your balls huh. Well I&#8217;m glad too,&nbsp; so long as they remain useful and obedient!!�&nbsp; Ivy taunted him.

Ivy then went onto the nape of his neck,&nbsp; biting him a bit harder.&nbsp; He groaned and moaned at the same time. It felt a bit abusive but erotic. He never had a young woman bite him in the nape before,&nbsp; making it a bit sexually as well as emotionally exciting 

Ivy used Charles until 5PM in the afternoon.&nbsp; Before she left,&nbsp; she told him that she would be in touch.&nbsp; When Ivy left his house,&nbsp; Charles was laying naked on his own bed.&nbsp; A part of his bed had a cut hole in it,&nbsp; since Ivy punctured it with the blade of a kitchen knife. 

�I must never make Ivy angry again,�&nbsp; Charles whispered to himself.

Now more than ever he knew that there was no escaping Ivy. 










































Chapter 40



October 31st &#8211; Halloween&nbsp; 



Afternoon



Charles and his friends were walking around inside a shop that sold costumes for Halloween.&nbsp; There were witches&#8217; masks and werewolf masks hanging on hanger railings.&nbsp; Clothes hangers were displaying Dracula outfits, ragged clothes (for witches), artificial policemen uniforms and many other costumes.&nbsp; 

Brady picked out what looked like a sailorman&#8217;s outfit.

�Hey guys what do you think?�&nbsp; Brady asked.

�I think you&#8217;d make a great sailorman!�&nbsp; commented Charles.

�He&#8217;d maker a great sailorman but don&#8217;t you guys think I&#8217;d make a great goblin!�&nbsp; Alex putting on a Green Goblin mask (from the first Spiderman film). 

�Definitely suits you Alex. It shows the real you!�&nbsp; Pete was being sarcastic.

Thomas laughed.&nbsp; 

Charles was eyeing a furry costume hanging by the wall,&nbsp; beneath a head mask that resembled that of a reindeer&#8217;s. 

�Hey guys what kind of costume is this supposed to be??�&nbsp; Charles was curious.

�Oh. I think that is meant to be Cernunos!!�&nbsp; answered Thomas.

�Cer�..who??�&nbsp; Charles asked.

Charles was confused.&nbsp; He liked the costume as there was something about it that 
touched him.&nbsp; There was something magical about it. Mysterious.&nbsp; Powerful even.

�Cernunos!!&nbsp; He was a Celtic god worshipped throughout Britain in ancient times. He looked like a man but wore a head-mask made out of a deer&#8217;s head. He was a nature god who had power over animals. It was even believed that Robin Hood worshipped him!!�&nbsp; Thomas said.

�Cool.&nbsp; I think I am going to get this one,�&nbsp; Charles smiled.

Charles took the furry costume and the reindeer-like head mask off the wall.&nbsp;&nbsp; Everyone picked out the costume they wanted and went to pay for them at the cashier.&nbsp; Charles was definitely going to go out dressed up as Cernunos.&nbsp; Brady as a sailorman. Alex as the Green Goblin (unfortunately for him the shop does not sell the flying gliders that the character had in the actual film), Pete as a werewolf (resembling the same fake werewolf type costumes found in kids&#8217; shows like Goosebumps),&nbsp; and Thomas as a bobby (a British police officer with the long cap and the small black club). 

The boys went out of the shop.

�So you guys remember the plan. I am going to pick you all up from your working place,�&nbsp; Brady reminding the other four.

Charles, Pete, Thomas and Alex nodded in unison.

�So Thomas where will you be?� Brady asked Thomas.

�Hmm.&nbsp; I think I am going to wait with Charles by his shop�&nbsp; Thomas looked to Charles,&nbsp; then responded.

�Ok.&nbsp; Since you don&#8217;t have any job to go back to, we give you our money and you go buy the drinks and the desserts.&nbsp; Think you can handle that mate,�&nbsp; Brady said.

�I sure can,�&nbsp; Thomas nodded.

The four boys gave Thomas some of their money.&nbsp;&nbsp; Brady then looked at Charles.

�Hey Charles you are still spending the night at my p[lace tonight,&nbsp; aren&#8217;t you??�&nbsp; confirmed Brady.

�Yes I still am!� replied Charles. 

Brady then looked back to Thomas. 

�So be at Charles&#8217; shop before seven.&nbsp; Don&#8217;t be late!!�&nbsp; Brady said.

�I won&#8217;t,�&nbsp; Thomas replied.

�And one more thing guys.&nbsp; Please dress up half-an-hour before I pick you all up.&nbsp; I know you all like to take your sweet little time and time is of the essence here.&nbsp; You need at least fifteen minutes to put your costumes on.&nbsp; Now I don&#8217;t want to see anymore of you ladies until seven o clock!�&nbsp; Brady joked.

All 5 boys laughed,&nbsp; then went their separate ways.&nbsp; As Charles went aboard his bike and cycled away,&nbsp; he thought about Ivy. He lied to her last night that he was going to go somewhere tonight with his mom.&nbsp; Tonight he was going to be hanging out with the other teens at Connor&#8217;s Hill,&nbsp; telling ghost stories. 





&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *********



Megan&#8217;s Bedroom


Megan, Ivy and Katherine were laying on their backs on Megan&#8217;s bed,&nbsp; facing the ceiling.&nbsp; They were just thinking what they ought to do,&nbsp; since everyone in town acknowledges Halloween one way or another.

�It&#8217;s that time of the year again.&nbsp; This is one of the most stupidest day of all stupid days!!�&nbsp; commented Katherine.

�Yup!!&nbsp; All the half-wits in this town are going to be dressing up in stupid costumes,&nbsp; thinking that demons really are going to break loose from Hell tonight and that they have to fool the demons or all kinds of shit like that,�&nbsp; Ivy commented.

�But it still looks like fun, if you ask me,�&nbsp; Megan smiled.

�Megan it is because of stupid days like this one that people like us get hated.&nbsp; I mean the same people who invented Halloweens were the same people who started witch-hunts and accused any woman more intelligent than themselves to be witches. Gypsies were accused of being witches,&nbsp; and only because they were different as well as despised by everybody else Don&#8217;t you remember what happened seven years ago?� asked Katherine.

All three girls remembered.&nbsp; Kids from town came up the hill and egged their mansion.&nbsp; 

�Oh yeah. Those kids from town threw rotten eggs on our doorsteps on Halloween night!!�&nbsp; nodded Megan. 

�Hey wasn&#8217;t Charles the ringleader of that group. I mean he led those kids up here!�&nbsp; commented Katherine.

Ivy didn&#8217;t say a word.&nbsp; She remembered it very well now.&nbsp; They threw eggs and more than week later,&nbsp; they went into town.&nbsp; The kids chased Ivy and threw her down the river.&nbsp; Under Charles&#8217;s orders.&nbsp; She nearly died.&nbsp; She never forgave Charles and the kids for that,&nbsp; since then.

�I mean now he is your slave.&nbsp; I guess what goes around,&nbsp; comes around!!�&nbsp; Katherine chuckled.

�I still remembered what happened after that.&nbsp; We went into town. Charles led the kids and chased after us. They were hunting us down. We three went separately but I was the only one they caught. They carried me and threw me down the river. I nearly died, if it had not been for that kind man who came and saved me!!�&nbsp; Ivy spoke bitterly.

�I&#8217;m sorry it happened to you Ivy!!�&nbsp; Katherine spoke sympathetically and emotionally. 

�Me too!!&nbsp; Megan spoke sympathetically and emotionally too. 

Both girls came closer to Ivy and hugged her affectionately.

�Just thinking about it makes me mad. I think about Charles all the time but not really because of what happened seven years ago. I mean how could he and the kids in town be so cruel towards me?&nbsp; Or us?&nbsp; Remembering that single day makes me want to hurt him badly!!�&nbsp; Ivy started sounding more and more bitter.

�Hey Ivy. You&#8217;re alive. That&#8217;s what counts. I know how much you hate this day more because of this particular event in all our lives. Look on the bright side. Charles is now your slave. I mean he has tattoos of your name all over his body now.&nbsp; There is even an image of you on that pale back of his.&nbsp; You own him. He is your slave and property. Now you can hurt him anytime you want. You won Ivy. Forget about the past.&nbsp; You know what I think. I don&#8217;t think we should let Halloween beat us. I think we should go out and do something. How about we all go to a pub and play some pool.&nbsp; Have some fun tonight. I think this will do that tough mind of yours some good!!�&nbsp; suggested Katherine.

�I agree with Katherine. And when you&#8217;re angry with Charles,&nbsp; you can always call him and piss on his mouth.&nbsp; And he has to take all that shit from you too!!�&nbsp; Megan cried with excitement.

All three girls laughed.

�You guys are right. Yeah I think we should go out tonight.&nbsp; I mean we can&#8217;t let only the other kids around here have fun!!�&nbsp; agreed Ivy.






Chapter 41





October 31st Halloween &#8211; Night


Connor&#8217;s Hill



Charles was dressed up in his Cernunos costume.&nbsp; He was sat down next to Thomas and Alex.&nbsp;&nbsp; This was a gathering of kids from Brady&#8217;s class and those from the lower three classes which made up the secondary level students were all huddled up around a large campfire,&nbsp; sitting on a circle.&nbsp; There were more than ninety teenagers,&nbsp; both boys and girls,&nbsp; dressed up in their Halloween costumes.&nbsp;&nbsp; The moonlight was shining above them.&nbsp; There were trees and rocks and even mounds all over them.&nbsp; Owls were hooting from tree tops.&nbsp; Frogs croaking from the background.&nbsp; Crickets making&nbsp; loud screeching. 

Standing next to the large roaring campfire were Brady and Pete,&nbsp; originally the two leading students in high school (but can&#8217;t be anymore since they graduated). 

�As you all know,&nbsp; it is tradition that we have a good time tonight of all nights. Every Halloween night, we all come up here and tell each other ghost stories.&nbsp; Now does anyone here have a story they would like to share with the rest of us??&nbsp; Please raise your hand and come forward!!�&nbsp; Brady spoke in a loud authoritative tone.

Some kids raised their hands,&nbsp; and then came forward to where Brady and Pete were stood.&nbsp;&nbsp; There were five boys and three girls stood now next to Brady and Pete.&nbsp; Charles knew one of the three girls,&nbsp; from his Saturday reunion party. 

Brady took out some straws.&nbsp; They were going to be drawing stories.&nbsp; The person with the largest straw will be the first person to tell his or her story.&nbsp;&nbsp; Pete and the eight other kids took out the straw from Brady&#8217;s hand.&nbsp; 

�Looks like I am going to be telling my story first!�&nbsp; cried the boy, who had the longest straw. 

The boy wore a Dan Dare costume. 

�So you are going to tell your story first.&nbsp; But remember to tell it and tell it well!!�&nbsp; advised Brady.

Brady and the rest of them went and sat down with the others.&nbsp; The boy began telling his story and Charles,&nbsp; like everyone else,&nbsp; began to listen and let his imagination run wild.




&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *********



Ivy and the girls were cruising around town in Megan&#8217;s Lamborghini. Megan&#8217;s mom had bought her the car about a year ago and was&nbsp; a way of spoiling her only daughter,&nbsp; whom she only saw during breakfast time and only when they all had dinner together sometimes.&nbsp; The mothers had their own lives, and so did the daughters.&nbsp; Megan was driving at the driver&#8217;s seat with Katherine sat next to her. Ivy was sat in the backseat.

�How often do you drive your car Megan?� asked Katherine.

�Hmmm.&nbsp; That&#8217;s a good question!�&nbsp; Megan replied,&nbsp; �Not sure really.�

Megan did not use her car that frequent.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Megan kept on driving the car until they all stopped by a pub called Nightshade,&nbsp; which was like a mixture between a pub and night club.&nbsp; Megan parked her car at a car park and all the girls got off.&nbsp; They entered the Nightshade.&nbsp; 

Once inside all three girls found themselves a nice empty seat on a corner while Megan would go to the counter and get them drinks. The pub/club was dark but few fluorescent lights were present on the walls and the ceiling above.&nbsp; Loud RNB music was playing inside.&nbsp; There was a great smell of beer aroma everywhere.&nbsp; Two men and one woman were playing pool by a corner.&nbsp; A skinny man in his late 40s was playing with a vending machine by another corner.&nbsp; There were few couples dancing on the dancing floor and some people sat down on tables,&nbsp; drinking and talking.&nbsp; There were even two women sat down by the bar counter too.

One thing made this club/pub stand out.&nbsp; It was the only establishment that was running tonight without any Halloween decorations anywhere to be seen on sight. 

The whole night the three girls were talking and drinking and once in a while would go to the dance floor and danced amongst themselves.&nbsp; By the time it was 12PM midnight (the Nightshade only closes at 2AM in the morning),&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the three girls were sat down on their table again but this time there were some young teens sat on the table next to theirs.&nbsp; Three girls and two boys.&nbsp; Ivy did not recognize them but judging by their accents, they were from the neighbouring town of Damascus Lot.&nbsp; What got Ivy&#8217;s, as well Megan&#8217;s and Katherine&#8217;s attentions,&nbsp; weren&#8217;t that these kids were simply from Damascus Lot, but one of the boys was talking very excitedly on his cell phone and his friends were listening in.&nbsp; The conversation was on high-speaker volume,&nbsp; even from the other side of the cell phone,&nbsp;&nbsp; and so interesting,&nbsp; that Ivy, Megan and Katherine wanted to know what was going on. 

�So you mean the whole town ganged up on her?&nbsp; That&#8217;s crazy.&nbsp; They really did it to her??� the boy asked his friend on the other side of the cell phone.

�Yeah man.&nbsp; I am here right now in Almond Street. Oh my God Josh,&nbsp; they are all grabbing her arms and legs,&nbsp; lifting her up.&nbsp; Josh get your ass back here now man.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t know what the fuck are you guys doing over there at Constantinople&#8217;s Lot anyways!!�&nbsp; commented the other guy.

Katherine then got up from her seat and walked towards the table where the five kids were sat.

�Hi!!&nbsp; You guys are from Damascus Lot right??&nbsp;&nbsp; What the hell is going on over there? It sounds something serious!!�&nbsp; cried Katherine. 

�It is serious.&nbsp; Apparently the town outcast, a girl from our school named Jenna, is being harassed and attacked by the other kids,&nbsp; outside some pub.&nbsp; Everyone thinks she is into witchcraft and now it&#8217;s getting out of hand!!�&nbsp; commented one of the girls.

�Hey why don&#8217;t we all go there now!&nbsp; Do you and your friends have your own mode of transportation?� asked one of the other girls.

That other girl was suggesting and inviting Ivy and friends to come and join them at Damascus lot. 

All eight of them left Nightshade,&nbsp; got into their cars and drove all the way to the neighbouring town of Damascus Lot.&nbsp; The five kids were driving in a Ford while Ivy, Kate and Megan were driving in Megan&#8217;s Lamborghini.&nbsp; As Megan kept on driving,&nbsp; Ivy kept on thinking about the poor girl Jenna.&nbsp; It reminded Ivy of her own ordeals seven years ago and how history was cruelly repeating itself.&nbsp; 

This was truly going to be a very emotional night for Ivy.&nbsp; Every Halloween night was emotional for Ivy but this Halloween night of all the other Halloween nights in the last six years was going to be the top one.&nbsp; This was why the other two girls suggested that they should all go out and have a good time tonight.&nbsp; Ivy did believe tonight was going to be different from all the other Halloween nights and now the reverse had been proven to be true.

Deep down,&nbsp; Ivy knew that tonight she was going to suffer intense emotional discomfort, as her heart bled for Jenna,&nbsp; a stranger whom she had never met before now.&nbsp; A stranger who, she considered to be a fellow sister.&nbsp; She was also scared too.&nbsp; She was so scared that she did not even want to imagine what was being done to poor Jenna.&nbsp; The more she thought about it,&nbsp; the more it disturbed her.&nbsp; And hurt her,&nbsp; both psychologically and emotionally.

�Maybe someone is going to call the police on those kids!!�&nbsp; Megan spoke.

�I hope so Meg.&nbsp; I hope so!!�&nbsp; Katherine sighed pessimistically.











































Chapter 43




Charles was sleeping in Brady&#8217;s bedroom.&nbsp; He listened to different horror stories from 7:30PM onwards up to 2AM in the morning.&nbsp; When the kids finished celebrating Halloween night,&nbsp; Charles followed Brady home.&nbsp; Both boys slept on the same bed,&nbsp; since it was only two of them and that Brady was both to lazy and too tired to get out his extra pump-up bed.&nbsp;&nbsp; 

Once Charles dozed off, his mind wandered off to dreamland.&nbsp; Because he had only been listening to horror and ghost stories the whole night,&nbsp; Charles&#8217; subconscious mind was only experiencing nightmares. 

One nightmare he had was that he was running past an empty street full of graveyards and that there was some kind haunting sound&nbsp; all around him,&nbsp; like a kid&#8217;s lullaby. It really freaked him out because it was night time and he was all alone. He kept on running until he saw Ivy standing in front of him.

�What&#8217;s the matter Charles.&nbsp; You look so scared,�&nbsp; Ivy talked to him in a haunting monotone. 

The way she talked to him really gave him the goose bumps. She then raised a knife in front of him.

�I am going to kill you Charles!!�&nbsp; Ivy said to him.

Ivy laughed evilly.&nbsp; Charles did nothing but scream.

In another nightmare,&nbsp; Charles was trapped inside a haunted house.&nbsp; He was trapped with Thomas.&nbsp;&nbsp; They were down the stairs.&nbsp; On top of the stairs they saw an apparition of a dead woman looking down on them.&nbsp; Her eyes were filled with hate and she pointed towards them.

�You will never leave this house!!�&nbsp; the apparition threatened them.

He even had a nightmare where he, Brady, and the rest of their gang were running for their lives.&nbsp; They were in some kind of forest in the middle of the night.&nbsp; The moonlight was shining on them and they were all hearing some kind of wolf howling.&nbsp;&nbsp; But they could not run for long.&nbsp; Before they could all get out of the woods,&nbsp; the werewolf that was chasing after them,&nbsp; appeared right in front of them.&nbsp; Its jaws were wide open.&nbsp; Its fangs looked long and hungry.&nbsp; It s claws looked like its ready to slash through them.&nbsp;&nbsp; The scariest nightmare was when Charles was inside Ivy&#8217;s bedroom,&nbsp; all tied up in a spread eagled manner on her bed.&nbsp; Ivy was completely naked and was on al four,&nbsp; on top of him. 

�Welcome to fright night Charles!!�&nbsp; Ivy taunted hum.

She opened her mouth,&nbsp; revealing vampire fangs.&nbsp; She gave him a mocking smile.

�NOOOOO!!�&nbsp; Charles screamed,&nbsp; closing his eyes.

SLAP

�Wake up!!�&nbsp; a voice called out.

Charles woke up,&nbsp; sweating.&nbsp; He found himself in Brady&#8217;s bed.&nbsp; Brady was sitting up next to him,&nbsp; under that darkness.&nbsp; Charles could hear his heart beating really fast. 

Charles realize that he must have been screaming,&nbsp;&nbsp; hence waking up Brady.&nbsp; Brady then slapped him on the face,&nbsp; to wake him up. 

�You had a nightmare!!&nbsp; You seemed so scared.&nbsp; I had to wake you up!!�&nbsp; Brady spoke in a concerned tone.

Charles remembered that he was sleeping over at Brady&#8217;s.&nbsp; 

�Man those ghost stories tonight really took the toll on you!!�&nbsp; Brady joked in a light-hearted way.

�I guess so too!!�&nbsp; Charles agreed.

�How about we both go downstairs and I make some nice hot cup of tea!!�&nbsp; suggested Brady.

�Sounds like a good plan to me!!�&nbsp; agreed Charles.

Then for a minute Charles instantly thought about Ivy. His nightmares were influenced by some of the stories he heard tonight but some of his nightmares were about Ivy. At least he didn&#8217;t spend Halloween night with her,&nbsp; fearing that she would go berserk and do far worse things to him.&nbsp; 

�Are you feeling alright Charles??�&nbsp; Brady asked in a concerned&nbsp; tone.

�Oh yeah I&#8217;m ok Brady,�&nbsp; Charles cried.

Charles did not want to think about Ivy.

�Hey Brady when we&#8217;re downstairs,&nbsp; how about we talk about all the ghost stories from the campfire party tonight!�&nbsp; suggested Charles.

Brady laughed.&nbsp; Charles laughed too.

�Man I love you.&nbsp; You&#8217;ve got the spirit!�&nbsp; complimented Brady.

1st November&nbsp; -&nbsp; afternoon



It was 1PM in the afternoon.&nbsp; Brady had just parked his car near the other cars already parked&nbsp; in front of Charles&#8217;s mom&#8217;s shop.&nbsp;&nbsp; Charles was sat next to him on the passenger&#8217;s seat.&nbsp; 

�Hey thanks for brunch and the ride Brady,�&nbsp; Charles said. 

�No problem.&nbsp; You should be grateful that all the town employers are letting all their young employees come in late today.&nbsp; I mean they don&#8217;t expect us to show up for work in the morning,�&nbsp; Brady smiled.

Constantinople&#8217;s Lot was a laid back town.&nbsp; All the teenagers working were allowed to come in much later for work,&nbsp; since they know that it is tradition that youngsters stay up light celebrating Halloween. 

�So Charles I am glad that you came out with us last night.&nbsp; I mean the only time we spend time together is when we all meet for lunch.&nbsp; And what do we all do at night.&nbsp; Chat with our friends online and surf the internet!!�&nbsp; Brady chuckled.

Charles chuckled too.&nbsp; It was true. The young quiet town of Constantinople&#8217;s Lot was much more like the big cities more than it would ever know.&nbsp; The youngsters who have Internet in their houses, tend to spend their nights online and only go out at night sometimes. It was the lure of things like Facebook, twitter, chatsites, youtube, forums and many more things. 

Charles unbuckled his seat belt and opened the passenger door.&nbsp; 

�Hey Charles,&nbsp; call me some time will ya!!�&nbsp; Brady said.

Charles nodded his head.&nbsp; Charles and Brady got out of their cards and Brady helped Charles carry his bag and plastic bag carrying Charles&#8217; Cernunos costume from last night,&nbsp; all the way into the shop.&nbsp; Sara was happy to see her son show up for work.&nbsp; Brady helped Charles carry everything behind the counter and then Brady left the shop.

�So I take it that everything went well�&nbsp; Sara said.

�Yeah I had a good time mom!!�&nbsp; Charles smiled.

�Well I am glad to hear that son!!&nbsp; Hey just to let you know that tonight we are having dinner at your gramps!!�&nbsp; Sara told him.

�Ok!!�&nbsp; Charles nodded,&nbsp; �So I will just get to work.&nbsp; What do you want me to do??�&nbsp; asked&nbsp; Charles.

Sara told her son to start at the shelf with all the electronic items packed in them.&nbsp; He had worked the whole day until he and Sara closed the shop, got into the car and drove all the way to his grandparents&#8217; house.






































Chapter 45




1st November - evening


Charles and Sara were having dinner with his grandparents,&nbsp; at the table and in the kitchen.&nbsp; His grandmother cooked them turkey, with some gravy and beans.&nbsp; Charles was cutting through his Turkey on his plate.

�So Sara,&nbsp; how is our Charles here getting on with this town?&nbsp; Is he feeling right at home here??�&nbsp; asked his grandmother.

�Oh we do feel at home here,&nbsp; don&#8217;t we Charles!!�&nbsp; Sara cried with joy.

Charles looked at his grandma,&nbsp; munching on his Turkey meat inside his mouth.&nbsp; He gave a warm genuine smile,&nbsp; nodding his head.

�So I take it that you are loving your house, your bedroom and the scenery too,�&nbsp; his grandfather said.

His granddad&nbsp; then chuckled.

Charles smiled at his granddad,&nbsp; nodding his head.

�So Charles you got a girlfriend yet??�&nbsp; his grandmom was being cheeky.

Charles shook his head.

�That&#8217;s s a shame. A handsome young man like yourself don&#8217;t have a girlfriend.&nbsp; I am sure that there are many of your former classmates who would like to go out with you!!�&nbsp; his grandmom spoke with over-excited confidence.

�But you know there is a girl who comes and visits him sometimes.&nbsp; A girl from his old class.&nbsp; She even spent two nights with us. I wonder why he never takes her out!!�&nbsp; Sara revealed.

�Oh!!&nbsp; That sounds interesting!!�&nbsp; his grandmom cried.

Charles was shocked.&nbsp; Why did his mom have to bring up Ivy? 

�I think her name is Eva. Very attractive too if I may add. She has long brown hair and blue eyes. Very polite too,�&nbsp; Sara continuing to talk.

Charles felt embarrassed. He wanted his mom to end the conversation.

�Oh our Charles is blushing. I think he is too shy to talk about it!!�&nbsp; his grandmom commented.

His grandmom smiled at him.

�Your mom&#8217;s right boy.&nbsp; You should go and take her out for a date. Then you will know what life with your grandmother and I!!�&nbsp; his granddad interjected.

His granddad laughed and his grandmom laughed alongside him,&nbsp; talking among themselves now.

�You know if you never ask her out,&nbsp; how will you ever end up getting married??�&nbsp; Sara giving her opinion.

�May I be excused.&nbsp; Need to go to the loo!!�&nbsp; Charles said.

Charles got up from his seat,&nbsp; and then walked out of the kitchen.&nbsp; 

�There he goes,&nbsp; our Charles!!�&nbsp; Sara proudly commented.

Charles went down the hall,&nbsp; towards the downstairs bathroom.&nbsp; He opened the bathroom door,&nbsp; turned the light switch on and closed the bathroom door.&nbsp; He looked at his reflection on the bathroom mirror. He looked worried.&nbsp; He turned the tap water on and washed his face over the washing basin.&nbsp; He then turned the tap water off. 

Ok Charles. Get a grip on yourself,&nbsp; he told himself.

Charles did not want to think about Ivy.&nbsp; His mom brought her up,&nbsp; thinking that she was such a nice girl. But he would rather not have his mom know the real Ivy. The nasty malicious Ivy. The Ivy who had a grip on his life,&nbsp; literally.

Charles had spent half-an-hour in the bathroom,&nbsp; until he walked out of it.&nbsp; He then&nbsp; joined his mom and gramps back in the kitchen.&nbsp; When he arrived, he noticed that all three of them were in the middle of some conversation.&nbsp; He also noticed that they looked distressed.&nbsp; Before he left for the bathroom,&nbsp; they were so full of joy and happy.&nbsp; Now they looked like the complete opposite.

His grandmom noticed that he had returned and joined them on the dining table.&nbsp; 

�Charles did you know that something happened last night in Damascus Lot??&nbsp; When everyone over there was celebrating Halloween??�&nbsp; his grandmom said.

�Damascus lot is the town not far from ours!!�&nbsp; Sara interjected.

Charles could tell from his mom&#8217;s face that the story was a matter of concern for them but at the same time wanted to get off the subject as quickly as possible.

�Why? What happened over there?� asked Charles.

�A young girl, about your age, was bullied and harassed by a group of&nbsp; other kids,&nbsp; during Halloween celebration on a street.&nbsp; They accused her of witchcraft.&nbsp; They ganged up on her and threw her off the cliff!!�&nbsp; his grandmom spoke with&nbsp; a sad but concerned tone.

�Oh my God!!&nbsp; Is she ok??&nbsp; Is she alright???�&nbsp; Charles asked.

This was history repeating itself.&nbsp; But instead it happened on Halloween itself and on the neighbouring town. Deep down he prayed Ivy never got hold of this news.

�Charles they found her body this morning on the sea,�&nbsp; Sara interjected.

�Mom is she alright? Is she in the hospital?� Charles asked with a concerned tone.

�Well I am afraid it is too late for that son!!�&nbsp; his granddad shaking his head.

�What???&nbsp; What do you mean??�&nbsp; Charles cried.

Charles tried blocking his mind from thinking of the worst.

�Charles honey,&nbsp; she is dead!!�&nbsp; Sara said in a high monotone.

Sara sighed depressively.

Charles could tell that his mom was thinking about him, and what he did seven years ago and what it had all led to.

When dinner was over,&nbsp; Sara helped his grandmom clean up in the kitchen.&nbsp; Later they all sat in the lounge,&nbsp; eating ice cream desserts.&nbsp; Charles noticed that all of them would take a glimpse at him and then they had a conversation about his biological father. Charles often spoke with his father on the phone.&nbsp; But only after his mother had a conversation with his dad. Charles now suspected that his mom never really told his dad where they were. If it had not been for Brady and the guys,&nbsp; he wouldn&#8217;t have known why his real dad took him out of the town in the first place.

By the time it was 11PM,&nbsp; his mom said to his parents they better get going.&nbsp; They all exchanged their �good byes�&nbsp; and got inside his mom&#8217;s car.&nbsp; Sara started her car and then drove away from his grandparents&#8217; driveway.&nbsp; His mom&#8217;s car wheels hit the road and then raced away.&nbsp; 

�Mom are you ok??�&nbsp; Charles was concerned.

His mom was driving too fats and that scared him.&nbsp; He had an idea why she was acting this way. 

Sara kept on driving,&nbsp; with her eyes on the road.&nbsp; She looked like she was in her own world. 

�Mom slow down!!&nbsp; You are driving too fast!!�&nbsp; Charles warned her.

�Yeah!!&nbsp; You are right!!�&nbsp; Sara said.

Sara then slowed down her driving.&nbsp; He knew that she didn&#8217;t want them to get in trouble ,&nbsp; that is,&nbsp; if the local police caught them. Charles was wondering if she knew that he knew about the past.&nbsp; He even asked himself if she was going to even bring it up?&nbsp; As far as he could tell,&nbsp; his mom wanted to be in denial of the past.&nbsp; Of what he did.&nbsp; His mom didn&#8217;t know that Ivy was that same girl he had the other kid throw down the river.&nbsp; His mom didn&#8217;t even want to know or acknowledge who the other girl was.&nbsp; She was angry with her son but he was still her son.&nbsp; She loved him and he knew that.

�Charles there is something you need to know!!�&nbsp; Sara began.

She is going to tell me about what happened seven years ago.

�Mom I already know. The other kids told me!!�&nbsp; Charles beat her to the subject.

�You�you know??!!�&nbsp; Sara cried emotionally.

�Brady told me why we left town. I mean I didn&#8217;t remember any of it.&nbsp; Relax mom. I never told dad that we came back here!!�&nbsp; Charles said.

Sara sighed.

�He can never know. He would go ballistic!!�&nbsp; Sara commented.

�I know mom,�&nbsp; Charles supported her.

�You know Charles I try not to even think about what you did. it hurts me to even think about it!!�&nbsp; Sara confessed.

Her tone was sad but she didn&#8217;t sound like she was going to start crying.

�I feel bad about what I did but you know that little kids do the most extreme stupid things,�&nbsp; Charles said in a humble tone.

�Well that is in the past son.&nbsp; I mean I am very sure that that young girl and her mother are no longer with us in this town.&nbsp; Oh God Charles.&nbsp; I didn&#8217;t want to say this to you.&nbsp; Her mother taught the judge was too lenient on you and the other kids,&nbsp; that she tried to bribe him to send you to jail or make you suffer extreme pusnihment.&nbsp; He was&nbsp; a good judge. He turned down her money. The town was on our side. The judge warned her that if should something ever happen to you,&nbsp; he would make sure that she is found guilty for having made any attempts against you!!�&nbsp; Sara cried.

Sara started sobbing up,&nbsp; then&nbsp; instantly breaking down&nbsp; into tears.

�Hey it&#8217;s ok mom,�&nbsp; Charles out a hand on her shoulder.

He was comforting her.

�No it is not alright,�&nbsp; Sara cried.

Sara tried wiping the tears off her eyes. 

�Did you know that when she saw me and your dad, she hoped that something should happen to you.&nbsp; She wanted the judge to execute you. She wanted you to die,&nbsp; because of what happened to her own daughter!!!�&nbsp; Sara continued crying.

Charles&#8217;s heart was beating really quick.&nbsp; Ivy&#8217;s mom wanted her dead but failed to act only because she knew the whole town would incriminate her. 

�Hey mom!! I don&#8217;t think they are in town anymore. I mean it was a secret right. The town magistrate wanted to protect us. He didn&#8217;t want her coming after us. I guess they all thought it was best we left town for our safety,&nbsp; or rather mine!!�&nbsp; Charles commented,&nbsp; in a humble tone.

Charles lied.&nbsp; He had to lie. He couldn&#8217;t tell his mom who Eva really was because if he did,&nbsp; Ivy would expose the truth and that would really break his mom&#8217;s heart.&nbsp; That,&nbsp; he wanted to avoid.

Deep down Charles feared that he was going to bump into Ivy and that it was just going to get worse for him.

2nd November 



Charles worked at his mom&#8217;s shop in the morning.&nbsp; At noon he took his lunch break and met up with Brady and the gang at The Crusaders.&nbsp; The rest of the guys gossiped about what had happened at Damascus Lot,&nbsp; during Halloween Night. 

�The reports said her name was Jenna and that she was the school outcast. Everyone said she was a witch and blamed her for everything bad that happened to them.&nbsp; Then while they were all out on the streets,&nbsp; the kids who had problems with her,&nbsp; saw her.&nbsp; They cornered her and she fought back.&nbsp; Since they outnumbered her, they overpowered her.&nbsp; they grabbed her and as that street adjoined with a nearby cliff, they tossed her high up into the air and she fell down into the waters below.&nbsp; Here I even have the newspaper!!�&nbsp; Pete spoke.

Pete put his newspaper copy onto the table and all five boys got glued into it.&nbsp; Pete turned the page for them where they can read the full article.&nbsp; The full article was two pages long.&nbsp; While the rest of the guys tried reading from the little bits of word imprints,&nbsp; Charles took a glimpse at the victim&#8217;s photo.&nbsp; The photo of Jenna.&nbsp; Jenna was a pale redhead,&nbsp;&nbsp; dressed up like some kind of Goth or Wicca practitioner. 

�Hey doesn&#8217;t this remind you guys of what we did to Ivy??�&nbsp; Alex spoke like an insensitive moron.

�Not now Alex.&nbsp; This girl is dead. Do you know that it is bad to speak ill of the dead!!�&nbsp; Brady said in an annoyed tone.

�Ivy is not dead. She is dead. Do you know what is going to happen to all those kids involved in her death. They are all going to be spending the rest of their&nbsp; lives in prison. Imagine if that happened to us. This is no laughing matter!!�&nbsp; Pete sided with Brady.

Charles could tell that they were making Alex feel like shit,&nbsp; and from the look on Alex&#8217;s face, he did feel like shit.

Charles didn&#8217;t want to be right now. He wanted to go back straight to work.

�Guys listen. I don&#8217;t feel too good.&nbsp; I will catch up with you all later!!�&nbsp; Charles said.

Charles walked out of their table.&nbsp; But from afar,&nbsp; he could hear Brady and Pete blaming Alex.

�Nice going Alex,&nbsp; you insensitive moron. Don&#8217;t you remember what happened to Charles and the rest of us!!??�&nbsp; Brady lectured Alex.

�Unlike the rest of us,&nbsp; the judge was more harsher on him for having been the ringleader.&nbsp; The judge told him that he ought to be sent to prison for having masterminded the whole thing,&nbsp; for telling us to throw her into the river where she nearly died and for having thrown eggs on her stupid doorstep!!�&nbsp; Pete lectured Alex.

�I&#8217;m sorry guys.&nbsp; You know I didn&#8217;t mean��&nbsp; Alex tried apologizing.

��that is the problem with you.&nbsp; You never think,�&nbsp; Pete cutting him off.

Charles felt sorry for Alex.&nbsp; But right now he would rather be in Alex&#8217;s shoes than in his own. 

Charles cycled back to work and helped his mom in the shop.&nbsp; He didn&#8217;t want to hear anymore about Jenna or Damascus Lot.&nbsp; By the time it was 5PM,&nbsp; he worked at one of the shelves.&nbsp; By the time it was 7PM,&nbsp; his mom closed the shop.&nbsp; She drove them back home. When they reached home,&nbsp; Sara cooked them dinner and they ate at the dining hall.&nbsp; It was during the middle of their dinner, that the door bell rang.

DING DONG

�You sit here.&nbsp; I&#8217;ll go see who it is!!�&nbsp; Sara told her son.

Charles gulped.&nbsp; Who could be at the door?&nbsp; Was it Ivy?

Sara left the dining hall and then came back to the dining hall.

�Charles,&nbsp; Eva is at the door.&nbsp; She wants to talk to you!!�&nbsp; Sara smiled.

Charles&#8217;s heart beat was beating really fast.&nbsp; He knew that he better go see Ivy before he let things get worse.&nbsp; Charles left the dining hall and went to the front door.&nbsp; Ivy was standing by the door.&nbsp; 

�Hi Ivy.&nbsp; How are you??�&nbsp; Charles asked in a genuine tone.

He hoped that Ivy wasn&#8217;t going to lose control.

�Drop the pretense. I know you hope that I never show up in your doorstep. I know that you know what happened at Damascus Lot. I can also tell that you and Sara are having dinner right now. Just listen. After dinner I want you to go upstairs and lie to your mom that one of your friends sent you a text message and that you are going to go see your friend.&nbsp; I want you to come over to my place and call me when you are at my doorstep. That&#8217;s all for now!!�&nbsp; Ivy coldly ordered him.

Ivy turned around and walked away from his door.

I am doomed,&nbsp; Charles panicked. 










































Chapter 47




It was 9PM.&nbsp; Charles stood outside Ivy&#8217;s doorstep.&nbsp; He rang Ivy&#8217;s cell phone number.&nbsp; Ivy picked up.

�I will be right there!!�&nbsp; Ivy said.

Ivy hung up.&nbsp; Charles had never been so worried in his life.&nbsp; He was feeling powerless. He knew that he was going to allow Ivy to abuse him in every conceivable way. Ten minutes later she came down and opened the front door.&nbsp; 

�Come in!!�&nbsp; Ivy ordered him.

Charles stepped foot into Ivy&#8217;s mansion.&nbsp; 

�Follow me upstairs!!�&nbsp; Ivy ordered him.

Charles followed her up the stairs.&nbsp; Once they were upstairs,&nbsp; he followed her to her bedroom.&nbsp; When they were inside her bedroom,&nbsp; she made him follow her all the way to her bed.&nbsp; Once they were near her bed,&nbsp; she gave him a cold look.

�Look�Mistress Ivy�.I am really sorry about what happened to Jenna.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t think it should have happened!!�&nbsp; Charles stuttered with fear in his voice.

Ivy put a lip on her lips.

�Sssshhhh!!&nbsp; Just don&#8217;t speak.&nbsp; Just be my good obedient Blond male slave, take off your clothes and lie face down on the bed!!�&nbsp; Ivy ordered him in a calm tone.

�Yes Mistress!!�&nbsp; Charles bowed.

Charles tripped off his clothes,&nbsp; until he was completely naked.&nbsp; When he was completely naked,&nbsp; he climbed on top of her bed and laid face down.&nbsp; His face to the bed and his ass to the ceiling.&nbsp; The moment Charles was in the position his Mistress ordered him to be,&nbsp; Ivy went to her drawers and took out some stuff.&nbsp; She then climbed on top of the bed and tied his wrists and ankles to the upper and lower bed railings.&nbsp; He was positioned in a spread eagled manner,&nbsp; with his ass and back towards her.&nbsp; Ivy also gagged with his mouth. 

�I know you are scared that I am going to blame you for what those assholes did to Jenna.&nbsp; She was my sister Charles.&nbsp; My sister. We were both outcasts. We were both hated. We were both despised. We shared a common fate.&nbsp; We both drowned except I am still alive and she is dead. Dead!!�&nbsp; Ivy screamed at his right ear.&nbsp; 

Charles started crying.&nbsp; The mouth gag prevented him from crying loudly but still allowed him to breathe loudly.&nbsp; 

�All my life I wanted revenge for what you did to me. Now I want revenge for happened to my sister Jenna and what could have happened to me!!�&nbsp; Ivy screamed angrily at the top of her lungs.

Ivy went to her drawer and stripped off her clothes.&nbsp; She then&nbsp; started putting on her dominatrix clothes on.&nbsp; She also put on a large 14 inch black dildo strap-on. She climbed on top of the bed.

�This is for Jenna.&nbsp; May her death not be in vain!!�&nbsp; Ivy cried angrily.

With one thrust up his pale sensitive asshole,&nbsp; Charles moaned really loud.&nbsp; His body jerked to the anal assault coming from her strap-on.&nbsp; He now knew how a woman being raped felt like. His moaning was music to Ivy&#8217;s ears. He cried as he was in pain and being humiliated and being punished for the crimes committed by other people. 

Ivy kept on fucking his ass while roughly pulling his hair and sometimes biting very hard on his nape.&nbsp; Charles groaned in pain to both the anal and nape assaults.&nbsp; As Ivy kept on biting the back of his neck,&nbsp; she left teeth marks on them.&nbsp; They dug really deep,&nbsp; as if he had been bitten by a vampire. 

Charles was experiencing what many men in prison had to go through.&nbsp; Being raped by other prison-in-mates.&nbsp; 

As Ivy kept on moving the strap-on dildo in a twirling motion,&nbsp; she would lower her hands by his chest,&nbsp; sometimes feeling for the nipple rings.&nbsp; When she felt them,&nbsp; she would twist and pull on them.&nbsp; Charles felt a lot of pain from his nipples getting abused. 

Please God let this stop,&nbsp; Charles begged.

He could nothing but cry/groan in pain.&nbsp; His tears just kept on flowing down.&nbsp; There was nothing he could do to stop Ivy from sexually hurting him. He could only pray for his ordeal to end.

Ivy went emotionally hysterical. She too stared crying,&nbsp; with tears flowing down her eyes. It was an emotional moment for her. 

�Jenna this is for you!!�&nbsp; Ivy spoke,&nbsp; as if she was actually speaking to the ghost of the dead girl from Damascus Lot,&nbsp; �And this is for me!!&nbsp; You died but I nearly died seven fucking years ago�

After having anal-fucked him for hours,&nbsp; Ivy finally stopped.&nbsp; She left Charles tied up on her bed while she went and took a long nice hot shower.&nbsp; After shower,&nbsp; she dried herself and put some comfortable clothes on.&nbsp; She then joined her slave on her bed.&nbsp; She climbed next to him.&nbsp; She fondled his hair. 

�Charles I came to a decision.&nbsp; I decided I wanted to keep you for life,�&nbsp; Ivy confessed her plan to Charles.

Charles gulped.

She is not going to let me go home,&nbsp; he panicked.

�I decided that you are going to stay here with me for the rest of your life.&nbsp; You will be my personal slave. You will be my pet. You will be my slave boyfriend. You will be a comfort boy to me. A fucking toy boy that I will do with as I please. You are going to write a letter to your mother. You will tell her in the letter that you decided to run away from home. You are running away because of guilt.&nbsp; Guilt for the death of that poor girl. Guilt for what would have happened to that poor girl you ordered the other kids to throw down the river seven years ago,�&nbsp; Ivy coldly making his life miserable.

Charles loved his mom.&nbsp; He was never going to see his mom again.&nbsp; Or his gramps.&nbsp; Or his dad.&nbsp; Or any of his friends.&nbsp; He was too young he had a future. Why did he have to be a slave? Why was he unlucky enough o be in a position of being blackmailed

�If you don&#8217;t do this,&nbsp; I am going to send your mom, your grandparents and everyone else in this town copies of videos of what I had done to you that Thursday,&nbsp; with a voice narration explaining to the town the real truth about us. that would break your mom&#8217;s heart, as well as everyone else&#8217;s. Now are you going to do what I tell you to do??!�&nbsp; Ivy asked him,&nbsp; even if she knew he had no choice.

Charles thought about it.&nbsp; He gave in,&nbsp; looking down on the surface of Ivy&#8217;s bed in defeat. He nodded his head. 

His life flashed before his eyes.&nbsp; Seven years ago he and his four friends met Ivy and the two other girls. .&nbsp; She was the despised wealthy outcast,&nbsp; who together with two other outcasts,&nbsp; lived with their mothers.&nbsp; Then he led some other school children to chase after her and when they finally caught up with her,&nbsp; they threw her down the river. She would have died, if not for some local man coming to her rescue. He left town with both his parents. Seven years later he returned to this town with his mom. The same outcast whom he nearly killed with his words of action, saved his life and as a result,&nbsp; ended up being her slave. When he first started out as her slave, he still lived at home with his mom Sara and still hung out with everyone else in town. Now his Mistress decided to keep him in her home,&nbsp; preventing him from ever seeing his own mother and everyone else again.&nbsp; 

Charles Greene was Mistress Ivy&#8217;s slave for the rest of his life and he can kiss any freedom and even any free will that he has left,&nbsp; good bye.
