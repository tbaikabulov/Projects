Synopsis: This is a Story of a youngs teen brutal introduction to sex and submission.






Chapter One 
My life as a teen was for lack of a better term a living hell. I wonder what I could have or should have done to try and prevent what I went through. Though a mute point now. 
My childhood was a happy one from the bits and pieces that I could recall but it wasn&#8217;t until my 13 birthday that things took a turn for the worse. 
I recall a small party of family and friends, friends who I didn&#8217;t realize then were sent home rather quickly and some family members who stayed the night. I didn&#8217;t know then what I know now, how my mother as a teen bride herself and in the midst of a sexual frenzy had agreed with my father that she would only keep the child if it was a girl and that as soon as I turned into my teens agewise was promised to my father not only to lose my virginity but trained to please any and all that he requested my services for. 
I was blessed as when my mother came down from her sexual high realized the mistake she had made and fought to keep me from the life she had in fact been forced into as soon as she turned 13 herself. She wasn&#8217;t able to keep my two brothers who were born before and I was yet years away from learning their fate of being given away as sex toys to other older male members of the family. 
As I fell asleep in my bed happy with the way everyone treated me, so special on my birthday and thinking about all the presents I had gotten.&nbsp; My mother had suddenly rushed into my room and snatching me off my bed, told me that my life was in danger and I had to stay quiet and do as she asked. Pulling me into her room and up pushing me up into the crawl space door in the ceiling she told me that no matter what I heard or saw I was to stay extremely quiet and not let anyone know where I was. For hours I heard yelling and screaming and I was terrified not only for myself but for my mother as well as hers were the screams I heard throughtout the night. 
But suddenly the bedroom door opened. I peaked through the cracks in the ceiling tiles and saw my mother briefly run towards the closet but my uncle snatching her by her hair and pulling her back to the middle of the room. Then I saw my father and my grandfather (my mother&#8217;s father) come in and start to hit my mother with their belts, demanding to know where I was, yelling at her that she was ruining such a special night. But my mother collapsed crying saying she didn&#8217;t know but that she would make it up to them. I couldn&#8217;t watch her get beat anymore so I turned my face away and covered my ears from screams and yells. I know now that she had spent that entire night getting beaten and fucked. 
It was hours into the day before my mother was able to get me out of the crawl space and begged me to say that no matter what I was to say I went to spend a couple of hours with a friend and had fallen asleep and didn&#8217;t realize I had done wrong by not asking for permission to spend the night and that I was sorry. 
My father however never questioned me about my whereabouts for the night before and other than constant closed door arguments with my mothers life at my house was relatively normal. My 14th birthday was nothing much to speak of, we didn&#8217;t even have a party and though I was quite sad about it, my mother said I should really count my blessings and this was for the best when you considering who our family was and refused to elaborate any more on the subject. 
A few months later I came home from a weekend visit with my friend to find my mother on the floor in the dinning room crying and my father just standing over her. As I approached and cautiously asked what was going on my father had informed me that my mother had decided she was going to live her own life and was moving out. 
My mother with a shocked look on her face sat there stunned and unsure what to say. Prompted by my father telling her it was time to say goodbye and leave, my mom asked if she could have a few minutes alone with me. A request that was quickly denied. My mother shot to her feet and ran up to me to hug me. Pulling me in tight she whispered in my ear that I need to be real careful and stay to myself as much as possible it would be safer for me, all the while enphasizing her words with tight squeezes to my arm with her hand. 
My father pulling her off and giving her a shove towards the door looked back at me and said I should see about dinner. I was in shock. I couldn&#8217;t move. I could hear her crying louder as he pushed her out the door and warned her to stay away before tossing her suitcases out to her and slamming the door shut. 
In he came from the hall into the dinning room with a big smile on his face and asked me if I needed some help in the kitchen. I reminded him that I didn&#8217;t know how to cook and that mom did it all. But he quickly waved off my words by saying things were going to be different from this point forward. He pulled some money out of his pocket and said that I really needed to learn as fast as I could or I would be really sorry. Tossing the twenty dollars at me and he told me to order a pizza this time and to make it quick our new roommate would be moving in tonight. 
I was in a dazed all afternoon and didn&#8217;t realize how much time had gone by till I heard the doorbell. I rushed through to the dinning room from where I had stood motionless for over an hour and as I got closer to the door I started digging in my pocket for the money.&nbsp; But as I opened the door, to my surprise, it wasn&#8217;t the pizza delivery guy at the door. Some tall man I had never met before looked at me and snatching me by my forearm pushed his way into the hall and closed the door behind him.&nbsp; He pushed me against the wall and forced himself up against me. He grabbed my hair and turned my head so I was facing him and then kissed me and force his tongue into my mouth. I tried to push away but I was just so small compared to him. 
He stopped trying to kiss me as my father walked into the hall and I looked over panicked praying for some help and fast. Instead the stranger just looked at my father and demanded to know why I was so cold. My dad meekly replied, "She&#8217;s fresh�untouched" 
"No way," the stranger said stunned as he looked at me. "Are you serious? Completely fresh?" 
"Yes Sir, I tried to take her and teach her but her mother fought me all the way.&nbsp; I eventually grew tired of the struggle and gave up.&nbsp; Deciding later that I would be sure you would enjoy the pleasure of being her teacher." 
My legs were weak, I couldn&#8217;t be understanding their words right. I was getting dizzy, my heart started to pound in my chest. And before I knew it the world around me was gone. When I walk up I was laying on the sofa and the stranger was sitting down by my side holding a glass of water. A sweet kind smile as I had not expected on his face as he appologized for scaring me. I sat up and reached for the glass of water even more confused. I must have misunderstood. The stranger got up and walked over to my father and quietly instructed him to make the proper arrangements as he left the room. 
My father grabbed my arm and pulled me up off the sofa and ordered me to my room to get some sleep.
Chapter Two 
In the morning I awoke to a weird noise. Quietly I came out of the room and tried to figure out what the sounds were and where they were coming from. Seemed to be coming out of the my parents room and for a minute I got all excited thinking my mom had come back but just as I was about to turn around and head back to my room to take a shower and get dressed for school, my father had come out. 
"What are you doing?" 
"Nothing�" I replied a bit surprised by the look on my father&#8217;s face. He had been crying, he bloodshot eyes and tear stained face threw me into silence almost immediately. 
"What&#8217;s the matter?" he demanded, a look of anger now crossing his face. 
"Are you alright?" I asked. 
"Whatever go to your room and don&#8217;t come out," but as I tried to protest and remind him that I had school this morning he took a sudden step towards me. "Now!" he yelled and pushed me back towards my room, just then I heard the bedroom door open and saw the stranger coming out with a smile on his face demanding to know what was going on but I ran into my room and didn&#8217;t try to hear their conversation. But there wasn&#8217;t any conversation to follow. 
Moments later I heard a thud in my parents room and the groans started back up. I buried my face into my pillow and wished really hard that I could go back to sleep, but it wasn&#8217;t going to happen and I don&#8217;t know how long it took before they had stopped. 
All morning I could hear scattered talk and movement about the house but not once did my father come in and say I could come out of my room. By noon my stomach started rumbling from hunger and decided to get up and take a shower hoping to take my mind off my hunger. 
The shower didn&#8217;t quite work for the hunger but it did help me relax and I was feeling much better by the time I got out and started drying myself. Walking into my room I let out a small scream as I had noticed the stranger now sitting on my bed. He stood up and appoligized for scaring me. I was too stunned to talk. I just stood there and watched him as he walked slowly towards the door and pointed to a tray on my dresser. 
"Just bringing you a little something to eat before we head out." 
"Where are you going?" I asked suddenly forgetting the fact that I was standing in my room with only but a towel wrapped around me. 
"Me? No sweetie�We." And with that said he walked out of my room. Needless to say I lost my appetite.&nbsp; I quickly got dressed and all the while wondered if I could make a run for it.&nbsp; Find my mother.&nbsp; But I didn't get a chance to really talk to her before she left.&nbsp; Had no idea where she went.&nbsp; But those ideas were quickly put out of my mind as my father just barged in my room, grabbed me by my arm and pulling me out the door announce that it was time to leave.
We sat quietly in the car for awhile, my father driving and I was made to sit in the back with the stranger.&nbsp; I could only assume it had been hours before the stranger started questioning my father.&nbsp; I was just grateful he stayed to his side and didn't try to talk or touch me during the drive.
"You called ahead to the make the arrangements for the house to be opened up?" the stranger had asked my father.
"Yes Sir," my father responded quietly.&nbsp; I was not use to seeing him this way.&nbsp; He was always loud and demanding and I don't know what happened to him to make him change so quickly.
"And your place?"
"Also taken care of Sir."
"Food?"
"Groceries are being delivered up to the house tonight Sir."
"Good.&nbsp; How about some wine?"
"I do recall you had a few bottles still in the cellar Sir."
"You better be right.&nbsp; What about the school?"
"School?" I questioned quickly picking up on the word.
"Already taken care of Sir," my father had answered back as if I had never spoken.
"Wait...what about school?" I pushed on trying to get a response from my father, but it was the stranger who had answered.
"Brenda, your school is hours away from my house and it's not rational to think you would be still going to the same school now that you two are moving in with me."
"What?"&nbsp; My heart was beating so fast.&nbsp; "What are you talking about moving?" But he didn't answer again it was as if I wasn't even there.&nbsp; Shortly there after we turned off a road with an electric type fence to it and the stranger had to press some button on his key chain to open it up.&nbsp; A few minutes later we came up to a big ranch style house and as we came to a stop my father quickly hurried from behind the wheel to open the door for the stranger and as soon as he was out my father grabbed me by my arm and pulled me out of the car and pushed me toward the front door.
Walking in through the front door I was startled by a couple of big dogs coming our way.&nbsp; I took a step back and bumped into my father.&nbsp; At first I thought he was helping from falling back but quickly realized he was just holding me in place.&nbsp; The stranger spun around and took a couple of steps towards me. Stopping in front of me and dropping down to his knees, he reached up under my skirt and before I could react he grabbed a hold of my panties and yanked them down but he didn't take them off, he knotted them up around my ankles real quick.
"In this house there are a couple of rules that must always...ALWAYS...be observed. First...you will not wear any panties.&nbsp; Second...Men are always to be obeyed.&nbsp; And by Men I mean males in general." And he pulled up my skirt and allowing the dogs to sniff and lick at my pussy.&nbsp; I tried to squirm away but my father stuck his foot between my ankles and stepped down on my tied up panties to keep me in place.&nbsp; With that the stranger moved in closer to my face and whispered to me. "Don't worry you, Butch and Duke will become really great friends...In fact we all will."
