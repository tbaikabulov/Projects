Chapter 1

Jill Wallings tugged the neck of her turtleneck up again as she prepared to start her lecture. The thirty one year old assistant professor did not usually wear something as casual as a turtleneck to class but she needed to hide the bruise on her neck and she couldn&#8217;t come up with any other reasonable way to do it.&nbsp; She was, however, regretting her decision not to wear a jacket or sweater over it.&nbsp; Even though it was too warm for either of those things, they would have at least concealed her body a little better.&nbsp; As it was, every feminine curve was clearly on display.

The students most definitely did not mind her choice of clothing.&nbsp; The boys all lusted after the beautiful professor.&nbsp; The girls were a mixed bag.&nbsp; Some envied her for her beauty and the effect she had on the boys.&nbsp; The others lusted after her just like the boys.&nbsp; Even some of the ones who considered themselves to be straight would have readily jumped at the chance to bed with her.

Regardless of whether they felt envy or desire, they all adored her.&nbsp; She was everyone&#8217;s favorite teacher.&nbsp; She was bright and lively.&nbsp; She took a genuine interest in each of her students.&nbsp; And she was always available to help them.

She started her lecture on the cultural history of south Pacific island tribes and every eye in the classroom was on her.&nbsp; After about ten minutes of speaking, she noticed that nobody was taking notes.&nbsp; Most of the students had their eyes roaming over her shapely body.&nbsp; Quite a few were fixated on her large breasts.&nbsp; And one girl was just gazing dreamily into her deep blue eyes.&nbsp; She vowed that she would never wear anything so form-fitting in the future.

She managed to get through the hour and handed out the homework for the next class.&nbsp; After the last student had left, she disappeared into her attached office, closed and locked the door, and collapsed into her chair.&nbsp; She groaned as the thought about her predicament.&nbsp; Her personal life was a mess.

She was happily married and had been for the past five years.&nbsp; That was not her problem.&nbsp; She adored her loving husband.&nbsp; But an indiscretion had turned her life and that of her husband upside down.

She thought back to the past weekend.&nbsp; It had once again been humiliating.&nbsp; While all of her friends had been having picnics or going sailing on the beautiful Saturday, she had been running naked through the woods with people chasing her.&nbsp; And that was not the first time.&nbsp; About once a month, she was hunted like that.

Jill was with a club on that day.&nbsp; She was not a member of the club but her owner was.&nbsp; The club members consisted of a group of wealthy dominant people, fairly evenly split between males and females, who liked to share their slaves and subs.&nbsp; She and her husband had, unfortunately, become slaves due to her indiscretion.

She had not done anything bad.&nbsp; At least in her mind it had not been bad.&nbsp; As a professor, it was common for her to write grant proposals and she was very good at it.&nbsp; In fact, she had won more grant money in the previous year than anyone else in the sociology department.&nbsp; It all supported valuable research, like her current study of the south Pacific tribes.

She and her husband had bought a new house a couple of years earlier.&nbsp; They were both doing well in their careers and decided to go a little more upscale; nothing extravagant but something a little nicer than the little bungalow they had been living in.&nbsp; They also anticipated starting a family soon and wanted more space to raise the children.

But when they were ready to close on the new home, their old home had still not sold.&nbsp; They needed the money from the old home as a down payment for the new one.&nbsp; And with both homes in their names, the mortgage company wouldn&#8217;t even loan on the new home because they thought that the couple would be over extended.

So Jill borrowed some of the grant money.&nbsp; It was just a temporary arrangement.&nbsp; They planned to finance the new home with a mortgage once the old one sold.&nbsp; And then they would pay the money back.&nbsp; Nobody would be harmed and the money would be used for what it was originally intended.

One of her coworkers discovered the missing three hundred thousand, though.&nbsp; She remembered that discussion vividly.

�So good of you to come, Jill,� he had said as she entered his office.

�What is it, Professor?� Jill asked.&nbsp; �I have a class in less than an hour and I have some things to prepare.�

�This won&#8217;t take long,� he replied.&nbsp; �And I keep telling you that you should call me Hal.�

�Sorry, Hal,� she said.&nbsp; �Just force of habit.�&nbsp; Jill had earned her PhD at Gulf States University where they now both worked.&nbsp; Hal Bascomb had been one of her professors and was her mentor while she was writing her dissertation.

Hal opened a folder on his desk and studied its contents for a moment.&nbsp; Then he looked up at her.&nbsp; �As the chair of this department, one of my responsibilities is the oversight of our grant monies.&nbsp; There seem to be some irregularities with one of your grants.�

�Oh, I can explain that,� she said readily.&nbsp; And then she laid out the events that led up to the loan and how she planned to pay it back.

�I see,� he said.&nbsp; �But we have a problem.&nbsp; Misuse of federal funds is a federal offense.�

Jill&#8217;s face blanched.&nbsp; She never thought of what she did as a crime.&nbsp; There was to be no harm done to anyone.&nbsp; �Oh,� was all she said.

�And it is a very serious offense,� he continued.&nbsp; �It is punishable by twenty years in prison.&nbsp; And of course, expulsion from Gulf States would be automatic.�

�Oh god,� she muttered.

�But have no fear,� he smiled.&nbsp; �Based on what you have told me, I&#8217;m sure that we can come up with a solution.&nbsp; Now why don&#8217;t you run along to class while I think about this.&nbsp; Come back later and we can get this all sorted out.�

After class, Jill called Hal&#8217;s secretary and scheduled an appointment with the chairman of the department.&nbsp; It was near the end of the day when Jill returned to Hal&#8217;s office.

�Thanks for you understanding, Hal,� she said as she sat down in the chair facing his desk.&nbsp; �Have you come up with anything?�

�I think so,� he replied as he looked at her.&nbsp; This woman is remarkably beautiful, he thought.&nbsp; And then he realized that he had that same thought every time he looked at her.&nbsp; �The best way to handle it is to return the money.&nbsp; Then we can create a document for the file, describing how it was temporarily used for some reason or other.�

�But I already told you that I intend to return the money.�

�Oh, but I mean return it now.&nbsp; I had a chance to speak with an attorney this afternoon and he said that this was the only way to limit exposure.�

Jill sighed.&nbsp; �I don&#8217;t have that kind of money, Hal.&nbsp; I can&#8217;t do that until we finance the house.&nbsp; And we can&#8217;t do that until we sell the old one.�

It was Hal&#8217;s turn to sigh.&nbsp; �Yes.&nbsp; Quite right.&nbsp; You did tell me that earlier.&nbsp; Most unfortunate.&nbsp; But there is another way that was suggested by the attorney.&nbsp; Read and sign this and I will make the deposit back into the account on you behalf.�

�Oh, Professor,� exclaimed Jill with a sigh of relief.&nbsp; �I mean Hal.&nbsp; That is very kind of you but that is too gracious of you.&nbsp; I couldn&#8217;t ask you to do that.�

�My dear,� he said, �You may not have a choice.&nbsp; It&#8217;s fortunate that I was doing my own checking of the grants yesterday because I learned this morning that the Feds have stepped up their audit programs and that a physics professor at another institution was indicted just last week for something very similar.�&nbsp; This was all a fabrication but Hal knew that there would be no way for Jill to know that.

�So I&#8217;m afraid that either, I put the money in there myself or you go to prison and I have to find a new sociology professor.�&nbsp; He pushed the document toward her and then sat back.&nbsp; �So which will it be?�

�Okay, okay,� she said as she picked up the papers.&nbsp; �Well thank you again for all of your kindness.�

�Not at all,� he smiled.&nbsp; She started to read the document and a frown started to appear on her face, followed by a furrowed brow.&nbsp; Then, all of a sudden, her jaw dropped.

�This is a joke, isn&#8217;t it?� she asked, bewildered.

�Not at all,� he said again.&nbsp; �This is a legal contract to memorialize our arrangement.�

�But this would virtually make me you slave,� she said incredulously.

�There would be nothing virtual about it, my dear,� he replied.&nbsp; �You would literally be my slave, as would your husband.�

�This is outrageous!� she protested.&nbsp; �It&#8217;s preposterous!�

�It&#8217;s the only way,� he said, �unless you can come up with the money.�

�Surely there must be another way,� she said indignantly.&nbsp; She was getting angry but was trying not to show her temper.

�Take it home.&nbsp; Talk it over with your husband.&nbsp; Perhaps the two of you can come up with a third alternative,� he said.&nbsp; �I&#8217;ll give you until tomorrow morning to decide.&nbsp; Oh, by the way, did I mention that the auditors are scheduled to be here tomorrow?�

Jill blanched for the second time that day.&nbsp; She felt trapped.&nbsp; By this time tomorrow, life as she knew it could be over.&nbsp; She picked up the papers and excused herself.&nbsp; She would have to come up with another way.


Chapter 2

She did not tell her husband about the contract at first.&nbsp; She described her earlier conversation with Hal and told him about the audit scheduled for tomorrow.&nbsp; And they wracked their brains together to find a solution.&nbsp; But no ideas emerged that would remotely come close to fixing the problem.

In the end, she told her husband about the other alternative.&nbsp; He just clutched the papers and stared at them as if he were in a state of shock.&nbsp; Finally, he spoke.

�It&#8217;s better than losing you for twenty years,� he said.&nbsp; He picked up a pen and signed the papers.&nbsp; With tears flowing down her cheeks, Jill inked her name in the space below his.

The next morning, Jill was waiting for Hal at his office when he arrived.&nbsp; �Did you come up with anything?� he asked.&nbsp; She simply held out the document and he took it from her.&nbsp; He flipped to the last page and nodded as he saw the two signatures.

�I guess not,� he continued.&nbsp; �I really do think this is the best way.&nbsp; It protects you.�

Somehow, Jill did not feel very protected at the moment.&nbsp; She felt very vulnerable instead.; and very humiliated.&nbsp; She had foolishly placed her husband and herself into a situation which had cost them their freedom.&nbsp; According to the terms of the contract, they would belong to Hal for the next five years.

�Please come in,� Hal said as he opened his office door and waited for Jill to enter.&nbsp; Then he closed it behind him.&nbsp; �Now, let&#8217;s see what I have purchased.&nbsp; Do be a good dear and remove your clothes.�

�What!?!?!?!?� gasped Jill.

�your clothing,� he repeated.&nbsp; �Take it off so that I can see if I made a good deal.�

Jill opened her mouth to protest but closed it again without uttering a word.&nbsp; What did she expect?&nbsp; The document was very clear on expectations and requirements.&nbsp; Immediate obedience was demanded at all times.&nbsp; No activities on the part of the owner were prohibited.&nbsp; She was clearly a slave and he was clearly the master.&nbsp; He could do with her what he chose.&nbsp; Reluctantly, she reached up and slowly stripped.

�This is an excellent arrangement we have entered into,� remarked Hal once she had taken off the last of her clothes.&nbsp; Jill was a remarkable beauty.&nbsp; Long flowing red hair spilled luxuriously down her back and chest.&nbsp; He reached out and tucked it all over her shoulders, revealing two large, ripe and beautiful breasts.&nbsp; He had known that she was well endowed but these surpassed even his wildest hopes.&nbsp; Her narrow waist and flared hips and nicely padded ass were visions of perfection. Her finely sculpted thighs and firmly muscled calves were magnificent.&nbsp; And her face, which he had admired for years, was simply gorgeous as it blushed furiously.

He did not touch her other than when he reached out and tugged lightly on the little red tuft of hair over her Venus mound.&nbsp; �Lose this by tonight.&nbsp; Be at my home at seven.&nbsp; You can leave your husband at home this time.�

Then he let her get dressed and go on about her day.&nbsp; That night, he raped her.&nbsp; Well, rape is probably not the right word but that&#8217;s how she thought about it.&nbsp; In reality, one cannot be accused of rape when one is using one&#8217;s own property.&nbsp; He did use her well and often that night.


Chapter 3

She stood up from her desk and walked over to the mirror.&nbsp; She tugged the neck of her turtleneck down and ran a finger over the bruised spot on her neck.&nbsp; It was getting better.&nbsp; Maybe tomorrow she would be able to wear just a blouse.

She had gotten the bruise during the hunt.&nbsp; Hal belonged to a group that enjoyed getting together with their subs and slaves.&nbsp; The club met weekly and there was some kind of activity or entertainment at each meeting.&nbsp; Jill was one of the favorites so she was frequently part of the entertainment.

About once a month, the group got together for the hunt.&nbsp; In reality, this was more of a terrorizing mixer.&nbsp; It was a way for the dominants to sample the charms of subs and slaves who belonged to others.

It was terrorizing to the subs and slaves because they were, quite literally, the hunted.&nbsp; The event took place on a large ranch and the bottoms were stripped, but for sneakers, and then given a head start.&nbsp; The bottoms would then disperse and try not to get shot.

The weapon was a paint ball gun.&nbsp; One time, they used tranquilizer guns but that was deemed to be too hazardous.&nbsp; Now everyone had a paint gun and each hunter had a unique color of paint balls.&nbsp; The rules of the hunts were changed each time.&nbsp; Sometimes a single hit would capture a slave.&nbsp; Sometimes it took two hits with the hunter having the second hit bagging the slave.&nbsp; One time, it took a single hit but that hit had to be somewhere on the torso.&nbsp; That turned out to be a messy day as the slaves&#8217; arms and legs were coated with multiple colors of paint as the hunters kept missing the mark.

Two things were constant in the rules.&nbsp; The first was that the hunter who bagged the slave got to keep and use the slave until the next morning.&nbsp; The other constant was the way the slaves were treated based on the order in which they were bagged.&nbsp; The first one bagged during the hunt always received the most humiliating or uncomfortable treatment and then it gradually got better as they progressed through the sequence until they got to the last �kill� of the day who got off easy.&nbsp; The �treatment� always occurred at dinner time.&nbsp; Everyone would eat and then they would be entertained through the torture or humiliation of the prey.

For her first few hunts, Jill was always the first one bagged.&nbsp; She couldn&#8217;t figure out why she was always so unlucky until one of the other girls told her that it was because she was so beautiful.&nbsp; �All of them want you.&nbsp; You are very desirable,� the girl had said.&nbsp; �They won&#8217;t even look at the rest of us most of the time until they know that they can&#8217;t get you.�&nbsp; That surprised Jill because she thought that the girl was beautiful in her own right.

But as a result of being the first kill of the day several times, she had endured some truly awful ordeals.&nbsp; One time, she was bound and then fucked by a German Shepherd.&nbsp; Another time, her breasts were filled with dozens of sharp needles until they looked like pincushions.&nbsp; Yet another time, she had been hung by her breasts and whipped.&nbsp; Nowadays, she was wiser and much more cautious.&nbsp; She never makes it to last, but she can usually end up in the middle by varying her pattern and concealment techniques.

She is told that she is still the favorite but a change in the rules has caused the hunters to not wait all day to bag a slave in hopes of getting her.&nbsp; Now, if a slave is not captured during any sixty minute period, the hunt is called off.&nbsp; The slaves refer to this as the �Jill Rule.�&nbsp; At least now, she has a sporting chance.

Plus, there is another slave in the group who is nearly as popular as she is; maybe even more so.&nbsp; A girl named Charity had been brought into the club by her owner this past spring.&nbsp; At first, that had been uncomfortable for Jill because Charity had been one of her students the year before, but they quickly became best friends.

Last Saturday, Jill and Charity had stuck together during the hunt.&nbsp; Usually, Jill liked to travel and evade alone.&nbsp; It was safer for her that way.&nbsp; But she always enjoyed spending time with her former student so they were a team that day.

�How high should we go?� asked Charity.&nbsp; They were climbing up the rocky face of one of the cliffs, hoping to get to an overhang.&nbsp; They figured that, once there,&#8217; they could lie on the flat rock and not be visible from below.&nbsp; The only way they would be caught was if someone climbed higher and happened to look right down on them.

�I think the second highest would be best,� replied Jill.

�Okay,� chirped Charity as she started to scramble up the rocks again.&nbsp; Jill smiled as she watched her student&#8217;s lithe body move gracefully up the rugged terrain.&nbsp; The girl had boundless energy and was breathtakingly beautiful.&nbsp; It was a treat for Jill to watch the firm bottom and thighs tightening and flexing with each movement even though she thought of herself as devoutly heterosexual.

They reached the outcropping and checked it out for the best hiding spots.&nbsp; They settled on a spot that would let them lie in the sun since the day was a cool one, but which would keep them pretty well hidden from above.&nbsp; They laid together, facing each other, and rested their heads on each other&#8217;s arms.

�Thank you for being so beautiful,� said Charity, tilting her head forward and kissing her teacher on the lips.

�Look who&#8217;s talking,� laughed Jill.&nbsp; �You are the beautiful one.�

�I&#8217;m pretty,� replied Charity.&nbsp; �But you&#8217;re the beautiful one.&nbsp; Inside and out.�&nbsp; She planted another kiss on Jill&#8217;s lips and then lingered there.&nbsp; There was nothing passionate about it.&nbsp; It wasn&#8217;t even sexual.&nbsp; It was just two sets of loving lips touching each other.

The day progressed and nobody found them.&nbsp; They could hear guns going off below and heard a few cries from slaves that got hit.&nbsp; Even though the paintballs were not lethal, they still stung when they hit someone, especially if that someone was naked.

Apparently one of the girls had climbed up onto the ridge above them.&nbsp; They heard the sound of a paint gun and then the cry of the girl nearby.&nbsp; The hunter climbed up the rocky face barely ten feet away from Jill and Charity but never spotted them.&nbsp; He claimed his girl and fucked her on the spot for the next fifteen minutes.&nbsp; Jill and Charity listened to the grunts and wet slapping sounds of the two as they went at it.&nbsp; After the male filled his slavegirl with his seed, he led her off through a different, easier route back down to the ground.

�I&#8217;m horny,� announced Charity after they had left.&nbsp; She moved her head down and started sucking on one of Jill&#8217;s nipples.&nbsp; �Aren&#8217;t you horny?�

�No,� replied Jill.&nbsp; �But if you keep that up, I will be.�

�Ooooo!� squealed Charity and then she started sucking harder and faster.&nbsp; Even though she considered herself to be heterosexual, Jill had made love with plenty of other females since becoming a slave and Charity was always her favorite sex partner.&nbsp; So the two of them took a break from the boredom of the day and made love in the sixty nine position with Charity on top.

That&#8217;s when Charity got bagged.&nbsp; Her bottom was sticking up enough to be barely seen by the hunter but she was wiggling it excitedly as Jill&#8217;s tongue drove her crazy.&nbsp; It was that movement that caught the attention of the hunter.&nbsp; With a well aimed shot, he was able to hit the bottom cheek squarely, spattering the green paint all over it as Charity was climaxing.

�Oh shit,� groaned Charity as she came back down from her orgasm.

�They were going to get you anyways,� consoled Jill.&nbsp; It was true.&nbsp; Sooner or later, all of the slaves got caught.

�Yeah, but it was bad timing.�

�Jill laughed and gave the beautiful pussy above her face another lick.&nbsp; �At least you got to climax.�

It took several minutes for the hunter to reach the spot where the girls were.&nbsp; That gave Charity enough time to give Jill her orgasm.&nbsp; They were lying together when the male poked his head up next to the rock they were on.

�Oh, look what we have here,� he said.&nbsp; �My two favorites.�

He bound Charity&#8217;s wrists behind her back and then told Jill to start running.&nbsp; He was only allowed to bag one girl but he could still splatter her naked body with green paintballs that would hurt so Jill took off.&nbsp; It was only a matter of time now, she knew, before she would get captured too.&nbsp; She looked back at one point and saw the hunter spreading Charity&#8217;s thighs and then sinking his thick cock into the girl.&nbsp; Jill had been captured by him during a previous hunt and she knew that Charity was in for a tough time.&nbsp; He tended to be rougher than most.

Thankfully, Jill made it across the open field without getting spotted.&nbsp; She found a good hiding place and hunkered down, trying to stay out of sight.&nbsp; She actually lasted longer than she expected but thirty minutes after she settled in, she felt the pain burst in the side of her neck and knew that she had been bagged.&nbsp; She reached up and touched the spot where the ball hit and then she held it before her face, seeing the pink paint.&nbsp; She wondered which dominant was assigned pink today.

Charity&#8217;s Aunt Janice, who was also Charity&#8217;s owner, stepped into view.&nbsp; �It&#8217;s my lucky day,� she said as she smiled.

�Yes, Mistress,� replied Jill.

�Come on,� said Janice.&nbsp; �Let&#8217;s get you out of there and get you cleaned up.�&nbsp; She bound Jill&#8217;s wrists behind her back, as was the custom, and then led her back to the ranch house.&nbsp; It turned out to be an easy evening for her.

Charity was the fourth from last at being bagged so she just received a light whipping of her breasts during the entertainment after dinner.&nbsp; Jill was second to last and only had to endure being tickled by a long feather.&nbsp; Compared to the ones who had been captured early, they had it easy.

That evening, Janice mostly wanted to talk.&nbsp; She asked questions about Hal and Jill answered them.&nbsp; Jill knew that Hal was interested in enslaving both Janice and Charity and she assumed that her owner for the night was trying to figure out what it would be like.&nbsp; They also talked about Charity for quite a bit.&nbsp; It was obvious that Janice prized her little slavegirl and loved her.&nbsp; They did have sex but it was more like making love.&nbsp; It was slow and tender.&nbsp; And they slept curled up with one another.


Chapter 4

Jill realized that she had been sitting in her office by herself for over an hour as she thought back on her recent life.&nbsp; But she had students who needed her help so she couldn&#8217;t stay locked inside her memories and regrets forever.&nbsp; She got up from her desk and unlocked and opened the door to the hallway.&nbsp; And then she had an almost steady stream of students visiting her.

At times, it was almost comical to her.&nbsp; Some of the students had specific issues that they wanted to discuss or well formulated questions that they were seeking answers to.&nbsp; Others, however, seemed to be there just to be there.&nbsp; They would step into her office and stammer and sometimes blush.&nbsp; They always looked at her face and sometimes their eyes would furtively glance at her chest.&nbsp; She knew that she should be offended but she found it entertaining and comical.

Finally, the flow of students ended and she was able to get back to her research.&nbsp; She was still reviewing and cataloguing her notes from a recent field expedition when Charity poked her head into the office.

�Hi, sis,� said Charity.&nbsp; �How&#8217;s your neck?�

Jill would have rebuked any other student who called her sis.&nbsp; She had earned the title of Professor through hard work and she preferred to be called that.&nbsp; But Charity was different.&nbsp; She really was like a sister.

Jill reached up and pulled the collar of the turtleneck away, showing Charity the spot where she had been shot.&nbsp; �It&#8217;s almost faded,� she said.

�Yeah, it looks a lot better. Can you talk for a bit?�

�For you, always,� smiled Jill.&nbsp; �What&#8217;s on your mind?�

�Not much, really,� said Charity as she plopped down into a chair.&nbsp; �I just wanted to talk to you and see how Saturday went.�&nbsp; They had not spoken since Jill had been chased off the ledge by the hunter who had bagged Charity.

�Saturday actually turned out to be a lot of fun,� replied Jill.&nbsp; �I loved spending the day with you.&nbsp; And you have a wonderful mistress.&nbsp; I loved being able to get to know her.�

�Yeah, she loved owning you,� said Charity.&nbsp; �She said your bright and fun and so, so sexy.&nbsp; But I already knew that.�

�How did your time go?�

�Not as well as yours,� responded Charity.&nbsp; �That guy sure&nbsp; likes his pain.�

�Yes, I know,� offered Jill.&nbsp; �He got me one time too.�

�I&#8217;ve never had a guy fist me before.&nbsp; I never realized how much bigger their hands are.&nbsp; But he managed to get it in.�

�Ouch,� said Jill.

�Exactly,� agreed Charity.

�So what&#8217;s on your mind, Char?� asked Jill, pronouncing Char as Chair.&nbsp; �Or are you just here to let me see that cute little slave body of yours?�

Charity hemmed and hawed for a bit before responding.&nbsp; �Well, there is something that I wanted to ask you.&nbsp; I wanted to ask you on Saturday when we were together on the ledge but I never know how long we are going to have during those hunts before we&#8217;ll be shot.&nbsp; And I didn&#8217;t want to distract you from what we had to do that day.�

Jill listened.&nbsp; She was tempted to close her office door but that would look odd.&nbsp; She always kept it open when she met with students.&nbsp; �Yes?� she asked.

�Well,� Charity started, �how do you feel about being a slave?&nbsp; I mean what goes through your mind on a day like Saturday?�

�Hmm,� replied Jill as she leaned back in her chair, thinking.&nbsp; �Let&#8217;s start about how I feel about being a slave.&nbsp; At first, I hated it.&nbsp; I never grew up aspiring to be owned.&nbsp; I became a slave through my own foolishness, which I would prefer not to get into.&nbsp; At first, it was the worst thing imaginable.&nbsp; And finally, I told myself that I could keep feeling miserable and sorry for myself or I could resign myself to what I am.&nbsp; And that&#8217;s how I feel about being a slave.&nbsp; I have resigned myself to it.&nbsp; I accept the fact that my body does not belong to me.&nbsp; I accept the fact that I must do as I am told.&nbsp; And I accept the fact that I have no control over my private life.

Charity leaned forward, resting her arms on Jill&#8217;s desk as she listened.

�I feel quite differently about Saturday,� Jill continued.&nbsp; �In fact, I feel differently about almost all of the group&#8217;s events.&nbsp; I love them.�

�Really?� asked a surprised Charity.&nbsp; �If you are only resigned to being a slave, I would have thought that things like Saturday would be a chore for you.�

�Well, what is a chore is when I am summoned at the end of a work day to serve that night.&nbsp; Or on a Saturday afternoon when I am in the middle of something.&nbsp; I go, but it always feels like something is being yanked out of my heart.�

Jill went on.&nbsp; �But for the scheduled events like Saturday, I have a chance to get prepared.&nbsp; Even if I don&#8217;t know what the event will be about, I can get myself into the proper mindset.&nbsp; I think like I am an actress who is getting ready to perform.&nbsp; The adrenalin is rushing and I am just focused on myself and making sure that I give the best performance ever.�

�That way, even if the event is awful, I can focus inward and enjoy my role in it.&nbsp; And every once in awhile, I get a pleasant surprise, like the first time you and I were paired together.&nbsp; I remember you being strapped to the table and me being able to take my time devouring your precious body and making love to you.�

�Mmmm� cooed Charity.&nbsp; �I liked that.&nbsp; But we made love to each other as I remember it.�

Jill chuckled and got up from her chair.&nbsp; �Maybe I should shut my door.�&nbsp; She locked it and then returned to her chair.&nbsp; �And I loved the time that you and I were bought together by that couple.&nbsp; Being sold can be horrifying.&nbsp; But I had prepared my mind to perform and then you were thrown into the mix.&nbsp; I had a lot of fun at the event and during our week of captivity together.�

�Mmmmm,� cooed Charity again.&nbsp; �Yes, I loved that too.&nbsp; We didn&#8217;t get much of a chance to be together during the week, but I loved being near you.�

�So in answer to your question, finally,� Jill started up again.&nbsp; �I loved Saturday.&nbsp; I had a ball.&nbsp; I knew that it was going to be a hunt and I knew that I would be shot.&nbsp; So I was able to get myself into thinking of myself as prey.&nbsp; And then you were thrown in on top of it and we got to make love again.&nbsp; Plus, I was finally able to get to know your beautiful mistress.&nbsp; I had the time of my life on Saturday.�

Charity smiled.&nbsp; �I&#8217;m glad that you had fun.&nbsp; I always love being with you.&nbsp; You are always so beautiful and so proud.&nbsp; But in a way, we are almost complete opposites in how we view slavery and the events.�

�Oh?� asked Jill.&nbsp; �How so?�

�Hmmm.&nbsp; Let me see.&nbsp; Well, I love being a slave.&nbsp; And I did grow up dreaming of being owned.&nbsp; Well I didn&#8217;t dream of that my whole life.&nbsp; But for the past few years, I have fantasized about it.&nbsp; I even used to write stories about it because it was the only way to express myself as a slave until recently.�

�Yes, your mistress shared some of your stories with me,� interjected Jill.&nbsp; �They are quite good.�

Charity blushed.&nbsp; �Thank you.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t write much any more, though, now that I get to experience it in real life.�

�That&#8217;s a shame,� Jill said.&nbsp; �I would love to read the story that included last Saturday&#8217;s activities.�

�Maybe I&#8217;ll try one like that,� responded Charity.&nbsp; �But there&#8217;s a difference between us about those events.&nbsp; You just accept slavery and I love it.&nbsp; You love the events and I dread them.�

�Oh, I&#8217;m sorry,� replied Jill.&nbsp; �I had no idea.&nbsp; Why do you dread them?�

�I&#8217;m not sure,� continued Charity.&nbsp; �Maybe it&#8217;s because I feel like there&#8217;s such a big audience and I will fail them?&nbsp; And maybe it&#8217;s because I will end up with someone like that jerk who bagged me on Saturday.&nbsp; I always love being with you at the events but that has only happened three times.&nbsp; An we never know if we will be able to be together until the event starts.&nbsp; So I go into each one filled with dread and live in terror through most of them.�

�I&#8217;m so sorry, sweetie,� said Jill sympathetically.&nbsp; �You certainly hide your feelings well.&nbsp; I had no idea.�

�It&#8217;s okay.&nbsp; I just have to get better.�

�Maybe you could try doing what I do.&nbsp; Prepare your mind for what is coming.&nbsp; Create a role.&nbsp; Get ready to be thrilled.&nbsp; And I&#8217;ll try to help by getting paired up with you more often.�

Charity smiled weakly.&nbsp; �I&#8217;ll try it.&nbsp; It&#8217;s better than going into them filled with dread.&nbsp; Let me ask you something.&nbsp; Do you think that Professor Bascomb would ever loan you to my mistress?&nbsp; Maybe for a week or so?&nbsp; Your husband could come too if you&#8217;d like.�

�Oh, love, I&#8217;m sure he would,� replied Jill.&nbsp; �But be careful what you ask for.&nbsp; He can be such a pig.&nbsp; I&#8217;m sure there would be a very steep price for that.�

�Well, I&#8217;m sure that the price would be worth it,� said Charity.&nbsp; �What do you think that he would demand for that?�

�You,� replied Jill.&nbsp; �I&#8217;m sure he would want you in exchange.&nbsp; He goes into every hunt with only you in mind.&nbsp; He has been dying to lay his hands on you.&nbsp; And I expect that he would demand your aunt also.&nbsp; He keeps talking about what a beautiful slave your mistress would be.

�Oh,� said Charity.&nbsp; �Well I wouldn&#8217;t mind being the price.&nbsp; But I can&#8217;t risk Aunt Janice.�&nbsp; The two of them chatted for a bit longer and then Charity left.&nbsp; Jill had a departmental dinner meeting scheduled for seven o&#8217;clock so she decided to just stay in her office and work until then.


Chapter 5

Work evaded Jill as she sat in her office.&nbsp; She kept thinking about sweet Charity and her loving mistress and the events of the past weekend that she and Charity had just talked about.&nbsp; �It&#8217;s a wonder that I get any work done at all any more,� she thought to herself.&nbsp; She was always either being a slave or thinking about it, it seemed.

She was able to get some of her research done though.&nbsp; She had recently returned from a month long field research expedition.&nbsp; In fact, she and Hal were presenting tonight based on that trip.&nbsp; He had gone with her.

In fact, he had insisted that they go.&nbsp; She did not want to.&nbsp; Their research styles were complete opposites.&nbsp; She was an observational sociologist.&nbsp; She believed that one could only study a culture from a distance.&nbsp; Any contact with the group being studied would interfere and change behaviors.&nbsp; Therefore, you would be studying something artificial.

Hal called himself an immersion sociologist.&nbsp; He said that you could only really understand a culture by becoming part of it.&nbsp; She considered that schlock science and tended to totally discount what was published by these participatory scientists.&nbsp; But Hal had insisted that they conduct this research together and that they do it his way.

He never said why he grew such a sudden interest in one of the tribes she had been studying but she knew exactly why.&nbsp; She had published a paper on them six months ago based on the research she had done in the previous three years.&nbsp; The paper, �The Sociological and Sexual Behaviors of the Incunu Tribe of Papaluana,� had brought her a few compliments from colleagues but there was nothing earth shattering about the work.&nbsp; But Hal had taken an interest in it and Jill suspected why.&nbsp; The culture of the tribe was very similar to that practiced by devotees of bondage and discipline.&nbsp; It was a male dominant society which probably made it even more appealing to Professor Bascomb.

Jill had become quite proficient in the Incunu language during previous visits so she was sent ahead to make the arrangements.&nbsp; She had taught Hal a few words so the he would not be at a total loss and she also typed up a little translational dictionary for him to study.

When Hal arrived two days after Jill did, she was already naked with her hands bound behind her back and a vine tied around her waist.&nbsp; This acted as a leash.&nbsp; The chief had been suspicious but amused by Jill&#8217;s request for immersion in the culture.&nbsp; She had always wanted to maintain somewhat of a distance in the past.&nbsp; After much discussion and haggling, the chief finally agreed.&nbsp; His price was that the beautiful redheaded scientist would belong to him.&nbsp; So she was kneeling at the chief&#8217;s feet without a stitch of clothing when Hal stepped off the boat.&nbsp; The chief held her leash.

�Welcome to our island, teaching leader,� said the chief.&nbsp; All dialogue was in the Incunu language but has been translated into English for the benefit of the reader.

�Thank you, great lizard,� replied Hal.&nbsp; Jill gasped when she heard that.&nbsp; It was obvious that Hal had not studied her dictionary very thoroughly.&nbsp; She glanced up and saw the chief&#8217;s face tightened into a scowl with his hand on the hilt of his knife.&nbsp; She knew she had to intervene.

�Please excuse the teaching leader, my savior,� Jill said to the chief.&nbsp; �He meant no insult.&nbsp; He is new to your language and needs to learn it.

Hal looked puzzled.&nbsp; He had no idea that he had made an error until Jill informed him in English what he had just said.&nbsp; He grew embarrassed and apologized.

�My sorry,� Hal said.&nbsp; �I am but a palm tree with fish.�&nbsp; Jill just rolled her eyes.&nbsp; She had no idea what he was trying to say.&nbsp; She just looked up at the chief and shrugged.&nbsp; This was going to be a very long month.&nbsp; The chief smiled back at her and shrugged his shoulders with her and then ruffled her red hair.&nbsp; She washed it every night but combs had not yet been introduced into this culture so she did not use one.&nbsp; After only two days without a comb, her hair was now a long, wild mane.

The group got through the introductions without further incident and then moved off of the beach.&nbsp; Hal was shown to the hut that he would be using and he unpacked the few items that he brought on the trip.&nbsp; Since this was immersion research, he would be wearing whatever the tribe wore.

After he settled in and made a few notes, he finally looked at the dictionary that Jill had created for him.&nbsp; He should have done that earlier.&nbsp; He had almost lost his life earlier because he had failed to study.&nbsp; He was still studying when Jill arrived at his hut, escorted by two young males who were obviously her bodyguards.

�We should speak English now,� said Jill.&nbsp; �But after this discussion, it should be strictly Incunu.&nbsp; I see you are studying the dictionary.�

�Yes, just brushing up, really,� lied Hal.

�I see.&nbsp; I must have had a few typos in that thing based on some of the things you said earlier.�

�It just takes a little getting used to,� Hal said.&nbsp; �What&#8217;s up with the two henchmen?�

�They are my protectors,� she replied.

�What do you need protection from?� asked Hal.

�You, I think,� responded Jill.&nbsp; �But the chief was not specific.�

�Hmmm� said a puzzled Hal.&nbsp; �Why would you need protection from me?�

�Because I am the property of the chief,� she replied.&nbsp; �That was the only deal I could strike.&nbsp; He was not going to let us live with the tribe any other way.�

�I see,� nodded Hal.&nbsp; �Do I get a girl too?�

�Yes.&nbsp; He said that you will be given a girl after you pass the manhood initiation and then you.&nbsp; You can claim the girl of your choice other than any katahuas.&nbsp; That&#8217;s what they call the main girl of each of the males.&nbsp; And I&#8217;m a katahua.�

Hal nodded again as he listened.&nbsp; He remembered from Jill&#8217;s article on the tribe that each adult male had a main girl.&nbsp; This was sort of like the head slave or chief concubine.&nbsp; She was not the male&#8217;s exclusive bedmate but was the principal one.&nbsp; And she typically assisted when the male decided to bring a different girl to bed.&nbsp; Main girls were rarely shared with others and it was typically for ceremonial purposes when they were.

Hal sighed.&nbsp; It looked like he would not be able to play with his favorite sex toy for the next four weeks.&nbsp; It was a shame, because she looked so erotic right now that he could easily fuck her on the spot.&nbsp; She stood proudly with her shoulders squared back.&nbsp; Her large breasts thrust forward invitingly and her tangle mane added to her exotic look.&nbsp; And her body glistened in the sunlight.&nbsp; Tanning oil had been her one compromise on immersion.&nbsp; She knew that she would probably be scantily attired for the month and that her fair skin would be ravaged by the intense tropical sun.&nbsp; She had no idea that she would be kept completely naked though.&nbsp; But she had brought plenty of oil with as much sun protection capability as possible.&nbsp; Even with that, she could tell that she was darkening already after only two days on the island.

�What&#8217;s the initiation all about?�

�I don&#8217;t know the whole thing,� replied Jill.&nbsp; �I just know that the last part requires that you stand on the point all night.�&nbsp; She gestured toward a little spit of land that stuck out into the ocean near the beach.

�Oh, that doesn&#8217;t sound so bad,� he said.

�At high tide, the point becomes submerged.&nbsp; And there are sharks in these waters.�

�Oh,� gasped Hal.&nbsp; �Maybe this immersion wasn&#8217;t such a good idea after all.�

�I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ll survive,� responded Jill.

�Do they ever lose anyone?�

�Not often.�

�When is the initiation?�

�In about an hour.�

Hal gasped.&nbsp; �Ohmigod!!!&nbsp; I&#8217;m going to die!!!�&nbsp; Normally, he put on an act of confidence and manliness.&nbsp; Jill was surprised at how quickly that fa�ade crumbled.&nbsp; She just hoped that he didn&#8217;t embarrass her.&nbsp; In her mind, having him eaten by sharks was preferable to having him act like a coward.&nbsp; She made some reassuring comments and tried to bolster his courage.&nbsp; Then she left him to his thoughts and was once again flanked on each side by her protectors.

A naked Hal was paraded into the center of the village an hour later.&nbsp; There he underwent a series of tests to prove his worthiness.&nbsp; He had to demonstrate his courage, his strength, his virility, and that the gods looked down on him favorably.

His courage was tested when he ran the gauntlet.&nbsp; The Incunu word for it translated as �woman maker� but it was essentially a gauntlet.&nbsp; All of the males in the tribe formed two lines that faced one another.&nbsp; They were all armed with clubs or poles or strips of leather.&nbsp; The initiate had to run through the village between the two lines while the tribe members swung their weapons and beat him, grab the icon at the far end of the camp, and then return back between the attacking lines.

Jill learned why it was called a woman maker as the chief was giving Hal his instructions.&nbsp; If he made it through the first test, he would be deemed worthy enough to move to the second test.&nbsp; If he did not pass the first test, he would be relieved of his cock and balls.&nbsp; Jill wondered how much of that Hal understood but was then thankful that he had not studied the language.&nbsp; I was probably best that he not know that he could possibly be womanized.

But Hal did pass the first test.&nbsp; He was badly bruised and battered but he returned to the chief triumphantly, holding the icon above his head.&nbsp; They moved to the second test.

A rope was tied around Hal&#8217;s scrotum and the other end was tied around a large stone.&nbsp; Hal&#8217;s test of strength was to stand up, which would lift the stone off the ground, and carry the stone to the chief using only his balls to support the heavy object.&nbsp; Jill winced as she saw him get to his feet, seeing the weight of the rock stretching the scrotum painfully downward.

Jill was standing beside the chief but slipped behind him to use him as a shield to block her view of the painful sight.&nbsp; But the chief pulled her in front of him and commanded her to watch.&nbsp; He reached up and toyed with her delicious, full breasts as Hal inched his way painfully across the village center.&nbsp; He eventually made it and was relieved when the rope was removed.

The next test involved a girl.&nbsp; She got him hard with her mouth and then pumped his cock with her hand until his seed spurt in a long arc through the air.&nbsp; He was deemed to be virile.

Finally, it was time to leave for the point.&nbsp; Jill was left in the village as the chief took Hal and two protectors down to the beach.&nbsp; Hal was sent to the tip of the point and was told that the chief would return for him in the morning.&nbsp; The two protectors were not there to protect Hal, though.&nbsp; They were there to protect the honor of the tribe.&nbsp; If Hal tried to escape, they were to kill him.

Hal spent a miserable night.&nbsp; The water was warm enough as it started rising but he knew about the sharks.&nbsp; He was in a panic by the time the water reached his neck and was filled with fear each time something rubbed or bumped against his body.&nbsp; But eventually, the tide started going out and the water level fell.&nbsp; He was not eaten by sharks.&nbsp; Apparently, the gods looked down on him favorably.

The final part of the ceremony took place in the morning.&nbsp; He was given his first reward as a man of the tribe.&nbsp; He was given one of the Katahuas for the day.&nbsp; Hal led the beautiful Polynesian girl to his hut and fucked her despite his exhaustion.&nbsp; He eventually passed out, using her as a mattress for much of the day, and then fucked her again when he woke up.&nbsp; She led him back to the center of the village as it was getting dark.

There, he was treated as a brother by all of the males and was given his tribal clothing.&nbsp; He received his breech cloth, which he thankfully tied around his waist.&nbsp; It only covered his front, and barely at that, but it was something.&nbsp; They gave him his gold arm band which he wore high on his left upper arm.&nbsp; And he received his weapons. One was a large curved knife that was worn at the waist.&nbsp; Another was a smaller knife, much like a dagger, strapped to his thigh.&nbsp; The third was his bow and quiver of arrows.&nbsp; He hoped that he would never need them.&nbsp; The only time he had ever used a knife was to cut his steak.&nbsp; And he had never used a bow before.

Jill actually found herself feeling proud of him.&nbsp; Despite his frequent pomposity and overbearing nature, she was glad that he had performed so well.&nbsp; Maybe the month wouldn&#8217;t be so long after all.


Chapter 6

Jill checked the clock on her desk.&nbsp; It was only five thirty.&nbsp; She still had a long wait until the dinner meeting.&nbsp; Her thoughts went back to the island.

Hal quickly chose his own katahua out of the harem of one of the other males.&nbsp; That was one of the things that amazed Jill in her earlier studies of the tribe.&nbsp; They were very protective of the females.&nbsp; All of the girls were associated with a male.&nbsp; There was no such thing as a single woman here.&nbsp; And, while they were fiercely possessive of their katahuas, they seemed to think of all of the others as merely temporarily held possessions.&nbsp; Newly initiated males were free to pluck any of them out of any harem they chose.&nbsp; Jill knew that Hal new main girl would probably be walking bow legged the next day.&nbsp; She had never known anyone as horny as him.

The days passed quickly.&nbsp; Hal learned how to hunt and fish.&nbsp; Jill learned how to weave and cook the native dishes.&nbsp; They quickly blended into the tribe despite being the only white people on the island.

Nursing was a community activity and each of the adult females was available to any of the children.&nbsp; Being naked made preparation for the task easier, but Jill found it an embarrassing job since she had no milk in her breasts.&nbsp; It was also embarrassing because it was only the older children who selected her breasts.&nbsp; Most of the women in the tribe were stunningly beautiful with large, firm breasts, but the teenagers chose hers.&nbsp; It must be the novelty of having a white woman, she thought.&nbsp; And she knew that they were probably having sexual thoughts as they suckled on her nipples.&nbsp; She knew that she was certainly having sexual thoughts as a result of what they were doing to her.

During the second week of their research, a second male was initiated into manhood.&nbsp; He endured all of the same ordeals that Hal had suffered through.&nbsp; Then, on the morning after his vigil on the point, Jill was selected as the katahua who would complete the initiation by being the first woman he would ever fuck.

She was surprised that she had been chosen.&nbsp; Surely one of the others would know the culture of the tribe better and would be better suited to be this boy&#8217;s sexual mentor.&nbsp; But she was proud that she had been trusted enough for this sacred ceremony.&nbsp; She took her job very seriously and, throughout the course of the day, coaxed every drop of semen out of him.&nbsp; She looked bedraggled and disheveled as she brought him back to the center of the village at the end of the day.&nbsp; He looked completely exhausted but was grinning from ear to ear.

It was during the third week of their stay that disaster struck.&nbsp; Oceangoing canoes were spotted on the horizon.&nbsp; Another tribe was coming to raid them.&nbsp; The men grabbed their weapons and headed out in small bands to track the canoes and defend the island.&nbsp; Since the only thing of value on the island was the women, the chief stayed in the village to defend them along with another one of the males.

Jill recommended that she be given a bow, a suggestion that greatly amused the chief.&nbsp; There was no way that a female could possibly shoot a bow.&nbsp; But Jill was insistent.&nbsp; She knew how to use one and she argued that it was foolish not to use every weapon possible.&nbsp; Still, she got nowhere with the chief.

Finally, she suggested that she be able to prove it to him.&nbsp; If she was not good enough, then she would give back the bow and wait with the other women.&nbsp; The chief finally relented.

Jill took a few practice shots to acclimate to the new weapon and then she took her first aim.&nbsp; A coconut had been placed on the ground as a target and she easily sank her arrow into it.&nbsp; Her second arrow also hit it squarely.&nbsp; They moved the coconut much farther away and Jill sank three more arrows into it.&nbsp; The chief watched in awe but finally agreed to let her fight.

The canoes divided into three groups as they got closer to the island.&nbsp; Jill learned later that two of the groups that tried to outflank the village were repelled by the tribe.&nbsp; The only one that successfully made it to shore was the one that was attacking the village frontally.&nbsp; Six attackers stepped ashore.

Jill had been placed in the rear and she watched as the chief and the other male from the village defended it valiantly.&nbsp; She saw one of the attackers go down but still they advanced.

All of a sudden, she saw the chief go down.&nbsp; He had taken an arrow in the thigh and was immobilized.&nbsp; She saw three of the attackers advance on the fallen chief.&nbsp; Two of them had their bows at the ready.&nbsp; The third had slung his bow and drawn his knife.&nbsp; It was clear to Jill that they intended to murder the chief.

Adrenalin surged through her veins. She let out a yell and leaped forward with her bow aimed.&nbsp; She easily killed the male with the knife with her first shot.&nbsp; She reached the chief as she was aiming her second shot.&nbsp; The two attackers stopped advancing, though. They had also stopped aiming their bows.&nbsp; They and the two other attackers further back were just staring at her, dumbfounded.

Jill stood over the chief, straddling his body as she crouched, ready to fire again.&nbsp; When the chief tried to get up, she placed her foot on his chest and pushed him back down, protecting him from the four men.

Her chest was heaving from the energy that was coursing through her veins.&nbsp; She yelled at them in Incunu to leave.&nbsp; She moved her bow back and forth from one attacker to another, threateningly.&nbsp; Then, miraculously, they did leave.&nbsp; They hurried back to their canoes and paddled away, leaving two dead behind.

Jill became an instant hero in the tribe.&nbsp; Never before had a female defended the island.&nbsp; She was given a name that she could not interpret.&nbsp; It was only later in the evening, after the wounded chief had fucked his brave katahua, that she figured it out.&nbsp; He drew a little picture in the dirt.&nbsp; It was crude but it was good enough for her to figure out what her new name was.&nbsp; She was Leopard Girl.


Chapter 7

When Jill looked at the clock on her desk next, it read a quarter to seven.&nbsp; She gathered up the notes for her lecture and then left her office to head across campus to the dining hall where they were meeting.&nbsp; She was not looking forward to this departmental meeting at all.

The title of the presentation was �The Pros and Cons of Immersion Research.�&nbsp; She would be arguing against it since she felt so strongly about the subject, especially after recently completing her first immersion research study.&nbsp; Hal would be arguing in favor of it.

It was not the fact that she would be arguing against the chair of the department that bothered her.&nbsp; Nor was she worried that it was her owner who she would be challenging.&nbsp; She worried about what humiliating stories he would share about her.&nbsp; And she worried about the pictures.

They had a video camera in the village.&nbsp; It was permanently on and fed its images via satellite back to a server on the campus.&nbsp; Jill had even negotiated its placement with the chief prior to Hal&#8217;s arrival and it was all set up when Hal arrived.

Negotiations over the thing had been difficult, not because the chief objected to pictures.&nbsp; He just simply did not know what pictures were and Jill had difficulty trying to explain the concept to him.&nbsp; She finally resorted to �it will help us remember.�&nbsp; The chief thought it was a foolish request but he allowed it and even helped Jill figure out the best placement.&nbsp; After she set it up, everything that happened in the village within view of the lens, was saved in the computer at GSU.&nbsp; Jill wondered what embarrassing pictures were going to be used tonight by Hal.&nbsp; She did not plan on using any of them.

Dinner was nice and she enjoyed the company of her colleagues.&nbsp; Then Hal stood up at the podium and called the meeting to order.&nbsp; �As you all know, Dr. Wallings and I recently conducted research on the Pacific islanders that she has been following for several years.&nbsp; This time, we conducted immersion research, which she has not endorsed in the past and still does not endorse.&nbsp; Tonight, using a shared experience, we will present the cases for and against immersion research.&nbsp; I will present the case for.�

He spent the next thirty minutes arguing his case and using stored images to back up his argument.&nbsp; He explained how they had uncovered the core values of the tribe through immersion.&nbsp; Images of him running naked through the gauntlet appeared on the screen as well as images of the tribe girl jerking him off during his initiation.&nbsp; �Courage, strength, virility and a favorable view by the gods are what they value.�

Jill had already documented two of those values but she had to admit that she did not know about virility or the views of the gods.&nbsp; She did notice that he did not show any of the pictures of his balls being dragged low by the rock, though.&nbsp; And the camera was not positioned to be able to record him on his vigil on the point.&nbsp; It was a shame that it wasn&#8217;t recorded.&nbsp; Jill was certain that it would have shown a desperate man whose face was streaked with fear.&nbsp; He did not comment on Jill during this section of his speech, although she was clearly visible in many of the pictures, standing in front of the chief with the chief&#8217;s hands playing with her ripe breasts.

�We also learned about the communal nature of child care in this culture.&nbsp; As you can see in this picture, our own Dr. Wallings participated in the daily nursing of the children.�&nbsp; The picture showed a boy sucking on one of Jill&#8217;s breasts as a line of other boys waited their turn.&nbsp; Each of them was sporting respectable erections.

He went on about knowledge that had been gained about fishing and hunting techniques.&nbsp; He talked about food preparation techniques that had been previously unknown.&nbsp; And then he told them that he had a story to tell them.&nbsp; The video started rolling.

It showed the raid.&nbsp; The chief was visible in the center of the frame, gesturing and clearly yelling.&nbsp; Others were standing in front of him, threateningly.&nbsp; The film showed one of the raiders raising his bow and shooting his bow and then showed three of them advancing on him.&nbsp; Two carried bows.&nbsp; The third was brandishing a knife.

Suddenly, Jill burst onto the scene.&nbsp; There was no audio so nobody heard the growls or yells.&nbsp; But they clearly saw her draw her bow string back and shoot, killing the man with the knife.&nbsp; They saw the confused look on the faces of the remaining two as she continued to advance.&nbsp; They saw Jill pull the second arrow from her quiver and aim it back and forth between the two raiders that were standing over the chief.&nbsp; Then they saw as she scanned her arrow back and forth across the other two raiders who were standing farther back.&nbsp; They saw Jill stand over the chief, straddling him in a crouched position with her bow drawn, clearly communicating that she was going to attack.&nbsp; And then the video stopped, leaving the image of her, with her naked body glistening and her wild mane flowing down her shoulders and back, with a determined and threatening look on her face.

�Ladies and Gentlemen, �said Hal, �I give you Leopard Girl.�&nbsp; He took his seat and there were a variety of giggles and chuckles around the room.

Jill stood up and walked shakily to the podium.&nbsp; She was not sure she could speak.&nbsp; She felt so humiliated in front of her colleagues.&nbsp; She took a deep breath and then looked out at her department.&nbsp; She set her notes aside.&nbsp; She would not be using them.

�I am Leopard Girl,� she said.&nbsp; And then she paused.&nbsp; �I defended my chief.&nbsp; And that is exactly why immersion research should never be conducted.�

�I am Leopard Girl.&nbsp; And I defended my chief,� she said again.&nbsp; There was complete silence in the room.

�Let me tell you why immersion is wrong,� she started again.&nbsp; �He was my chief.&nbsp; I belonged to him.&nbsp; He protected me and looked after me.&nbsp; I was his prized possession.&nbsp; As scientists, how can we study and research and observe without letting bias and opinion enter into the equation when we are that close to our subjects?�

�I created a new role for their culture,� she continued.&nbsp; �They had never had a Leopard Girl before.&nbsp; Our role is pursuing science; not creating history.&nbsp; In a male dominated society, who knows what the introduction of a Leopard Girl role will do?&nbsp; It could change the culture and it could ultimately destroy it.�

�I placed myself in harm&#8217;s way through immersion research.&nbsp; There is always some element of risk in field work.&nbsp; But in immersion, you become one with the culture and that puts you in danger.�

�And finally, I killed a man.&nbsp; I committed no crime.&nbsp; It is not illegal in that country to defend your women.&nbsp; But I will have to live the rest of my life knowing that I took the life of another human being.&nbsp; I have no idea if he had a wife or family, but he probably did.&nbsp; His children will probably grow up bitter and one of them will raid again someday in the name of vengeance.&nbsp; And the harm that comes from that raid, and the next, and the next, will be a result of my actions in immersion research.

She ended her short, sobering speech with the image of her naked, glistening body still projected on the screen behind her.&nbsp; �I am Leopard Girl.&nbsp; I defended my chief.&nbsp; No good can come from immersion research.�

The audience was silent for several moments.&nbsp; Jill hoped that they would someday forgive her.&nbsp; They were all good scientists.&nbsp; And then there was a clap.&nbsp; It was followed by another clap a second later and then a rhythm was started and others joined in.&nbsp; Then the clapping tempo was supplemented with a chant.

�LEO PARD GIRL�. LEO PARD.GIRL� LEO PARD GIRL!�&nbsp; The audience rose to their feet and kept up the clapping and chanting.&nbsp; Jill looked around, confused.&nbsp; Then tears came to her eyes as she realized that her colleagues were rallying around her in support.

Hal let this go on for several minutes before stepping to the podium, wrapping his arm around Jill&#8217;s waist and giving her a hug.&nbsp; �Let&#8217;s hear it for Leopard Girl!�

The audience broke into raucous cheering and Hal gave Jill another squeeze.&nbsp; It would have looked like a chaste gesture to most people but Jill knew that Hal was claiming his property rights over her.

�You have heard both sides of the debate now, �he said.&nbsp; �We will continue this discussion at our next meeting.&nbsp; But I have some exciting news for you.&nbsp; Leopard Girl and I are returning to the tribe in two weeks to conduct another month&#8217;s worth of research.�

Jill gasped at hearing the news.&nbsp; She had no idea.&nbsp; She turned to him and just stared at him, astonished.


Chapter 8

Word spread quickly on the campus.&nbsp; Jill had been popular before but she achieved a kind of celebrity status after her identity as Leopard Girl was revealed.

Posters of her naked, threatening form standing over the chief and brandishing her bow showed up in the hallways and on kiosks throughout the campus.&nbsp; Her lecture halls were packed to overflowing and security had to be called in for crowd control.&nbsp; There was a constant, long line outside her door during her office hours and she was frequently stopped in the hallways and asked to sign copies of the poster.

It was totally humiliating to see her naked body displayed everywhere.&nbsp; She could not believe that the police did not tear the posters down.&nbsp; She did remove some that were near her office but they were replaced by others by the next morning.&nbsp; There seemed to be no escaping them.&nbsp; But by the third or fourth day, the humiliation receded and it was just one more indignity that she resigned herself to.

Hal was enjoying all of this greatly.&nbsp; He loved to embarrass his girl and this was just another in a long string of humiliations.&nbsp; But he also loved the way that everyone wanted to be close to her.&nbsp; He could tell that she was the most desired female.&nbsp; And she belonged to him.

At the next club gathering, it was suggested that Jill be allowed to be a hunter at the next hunt.&nbsp; Fortunately, the next hunt was scheduled to take place when she was back on the island.&nbsp; She assumed that all of the fuss would die down by the time she returned and she would not have to be a huntress.&nbsp; At least, she hoped it would die down.&nbsp; She knew that she would get no pleasure from shooting and capturing one of her fellow slaves; unless it was Charity, of course.

She also knew that her absence from the hunt might mean that her husband would be required to take her place.&nbsp; He absolutely hated the hunts, not because of being prey but because of who always stalked him.&nbsp; There were several gay dominants and one of them had developed an interest in him.&nbsp; At the previous hunts that he had attended, this particular gay dominant had stalked him and bagged him each time.&nbsp; He had spent the night with a cock in his mouth or ass each time and had miserable experiences.

There were actually two club gatherings before she had to go on her next trip.&nbsp; At the first one, Hal demonstrated the strength test of the Incunu.&nbsp; He demonstrated it on each of the male slaves instead of himself, however.&nbsp; Once again, Jill had to watch the painful exercise but, this time, she did not have the chief to support and comfort her.

At the other gathering, she was once again paired up with Charity.&nbsp; She had talked to Hal about it and he had agreed to work on pairing them more frequently.&nbsp; The entertainment at this gathering was a contest.&nbsp; Jill and Charity would be competing against one another.&nbsp; The contest was a form of wrestling match.&nbsp; Each of the girls was oiled up, as was the mat where they would be competing.&nbsp; The objective was to put a butt plug, a dildo and a gag in the opponent.&nbsp; Once an object was placed, taking it out of letting it slip out would automatically disqualify that girl.&nbsp; The first girl to place all three objects in her opponent would win.&nbsp; The loser would become the property of the winning slave&#8217;s owner for two days.&nbsp; So either Jill would belong to Janice or Charity would belong to Hal.&nbsp; Either way, Jill would get to spend some time with Charity.

The bell rang to start the match.&nbsp; Each girl wore a leather thong around her waist and the objects were clipped to the thong.&nbsp; The girls started circling each other.

�So you&#8217;re Leopard Girl, huh?� chided Charity as she circled and reached out, parrying.&nbsp; �Well meet Panther Girl!�

Jill smiled at her young friend and student.&nbsp; �Nice to meet you, Panther Girl.&nbsp; But I&#8217;m going to turn you into Pussy Girl tonight.�&nbsp; The others at the gathering circled the mat and roared with laughter at the exchange.

�Go get her, Panther Girl!� shouted one.&nbsp; �Stuff Pussy Girl&#8217;s pussy,� encouraged another.&nbsp; They eventually started grappling but the oil made gripping one another difficult.&nbsp; It also made it hard to stand and soon they fell to the mat.

Jill fell on top of Charity who had landed on her stomach.&nbsp; Jill took advantage of the position and straddled the younger girl, quickly plugging her ass.&nbsp; The penetration was easy do to all of the oil but Charity still squealed as the large object was driven deep into her rectum.

Charity arched her body upward suddenly, knocking Jill off balance and sending her sprawling.&nbsp; Now the tables were turned and it was the younger slave straddling the older one.&nbsp; Charity was fast and she quickly slipped the dildo into the older girl&#8217;s pussy.&nbsp; Jill was so shocked at what just happened that she was slow to react.&nbsp; Charity started pumping the dildo in and out and then pushed it deep, ramming it against Jill&#8217;s cervix.

Jill gasped as the pain sent cramps through her belly and, once again, Charity took advantage of the situation.&nbsp; She plunged the dildo back in again, eliciting another gasp and then quickly shoved the gag into Jill&#8217;s mouth.&nbsp; The gag was just a foam rubber ball that was easy to squeeze into the opened mouth.

�Panther Girl&#8217;s going to catch herself a leopard,� taunted Charity as she looked down at Jill.&nbsp; She reached down and tweaked the two slippery nipples and then reached for the butt plug.&nbsp; This got Jill motivated and she bucked Charity off of her and then quickly got to her feet.&nbsp; She started slowly circling the younger slave and then knocked her to the mat.

Jill sat on Charity&#8217;s chest as the teenager wiggled and struggled beneath her.&nbsp; She clamped Charity&#8217;s nose between her fingers but they slipped off because of all of the oil.&nbsp; She clamped it again, holding it tighter.&nbsp; Because of all of the exertions and because she had exhaled just before her nose was clamped, Charity could not last long.&nbsp; And as soon as she opened her mouth to breathe, Jill stuffed it with the gag.

�Hih!� exclaimed Charity around the gag as she tried to say �Shit!�

The crowd was very excited at this point and was cheering loudly.&nbsp; Bets were being placed on who the winner would be and the odds appeared to be even.&nbsp; But Jill had the upper hand at this point.&nbsp; She was still sitting on Charity&#8217;s chest.

Charity had her legs pressed tightly together to protect her sex from the coming assault.&nbsp; Jill slid down until she was straddling the younger girl&#8217;s waist as Charity continued to struggle.&nbsp; Charity bent her legs and pushed with her feet as she placed her hands on the mat to push, trying to scoot out from under her opponent.&nbsp; But the mat was so slippery that she could not get any traction.

Jill slid lower on Charity&#8217;s body and was now straddling her legs.&nbsp; Charity kept sitting up to wrestle with Jill using her arms but Jill kept pushing her back down.&nbsp; Charity was tiring out.

The end came swiftly after that.&nbsp; Jill squeezed one knee between the tightly clamped legs and then got her other knee between them.&nbsp; Using the strength of her thighs, she parted the legs and easily slid the dildo home.&nbsp; Charity fell back onto the mat, defeated.

Jill decided to have a little fun at that point.&nbsp; She started moving the dildo in and out of her defeated foe and spit out her gag.&nbsp; Then she laid down between the parted legs and started flickering her tongue over Charity&#8217;s distended clit.&nbsp; Jill was amazed at how well lubricated the girl was.&nbsp; The oil helped, but Jill could taste Charity&#8217;s juices flowing freely.

The dominant who had appointed himself as the referee stepped onto the mat and declared Jill to be the winner.&nbsp; But Jill just kept munching on her friend.&nbsp; She kept moving the dildo in and out and then started doing the same with the butt plug.&nbsp; Charity was so aroused by all of this sexual activity that she climaxed within thirty seconds of her defeat.

Leopard Girl had won in battle again.&nbsp; And no, the self-proclaimed Panther Girl belonged to Hal for the next two days.&nbsp; It was Friday night, so Charity would have a new owner until Monday morning.


Chapter 9

Jill had to fly out the next morning.&nbsp; Once again, Hal was sending her back to the island ahead of him to make the arrangements.&nbsp; She suspected that he had arranged the timing of the wrestling contest and her flight so that he would have Charity all to himself for the weekend.


�Is that all you&#8217;re taking?� asked Charity.&nbsp; She and Hal were driving Jill to the airport.&nbsp; �You&#8217;re going half way around the world and you only have a carryon?�

�Well, it&#8217;s not like I need a lot of clothes when I&#8217;m there.�&nbsp; This caused Charity to giggle.&nbsp; She had seen the Leopard Girl posters but assumed that Jill wore clothes at least some of the time.

�You are naked the whole time?� Charity asked.

�Buck naked,� replied Jill.&nbsp; �For the next month, I won&#8217;t see a stitch of clothing.�&nbsp; In fact, most of the stuff in her carryon was for work.&nbsp; She had some journal books and pencils and pens and two video cameras.&nbsp; She only had one extra outfit packed.

�Wow!� exclaimed Charity.&nbsp; �That explains your great tan.�

�Yup,� nodded Jill.

�Well, I&#8217;m going to miss you,� said Charity.

�I&#8217;m going to miss you too, sweetie.�

�Don&#8217;t worry about Charity,� interjected Hal.&nbsp; �I&#8217;ll keep her too busy over the next couple of days to miss you.�

�Yes, I&#8217;m sure you will,� nodded Jill.

Charity and Jill hugged and kissed one another at the airport and then left Jill to her travels.&nbsp; The trip was long but uneventful.&nbsp; By the next evening, she set foot back on the Incunu beach.

The chief&#8217;s wound had healed nicely.&nbsp; He was very surprised to see her back so soon, though, since she normally only visited once each year.&nbsp; And even though they did not have calendars on the island, he knew that it was too soon for her return.

�How is my Leopard Girl?� he asked.

�Your Leopard Girl is well, my savior,� she replied.&nbsp; �I have returned to spend more time with you and your tribe.�&nbsp; She went on to explain that she was back to learn more about their culture and asked to be allowed to join their tribe again.&nbsp; The negotiations ended the same as last time.&nbsp; The only difference was that Jill would not be displacing the chief&#8217;s usual katahua during this visit.&nbsp; Instead, he would have two main girls this time until she left again.&nbsp; Before leaving the beach, Jill was naked with her wrists tied behind her back.

As the chief led her to the center of the village, the children started squealing and jumping around excitedly.&nbsp; The girls were excited because Leopard Girl was back.&nbsp; Jill had become a living legend and a role model for many of the girls.&nbsp; The boys were excited because their favorite breasts had returned.&nbsp; She saw several of them becoming erect as she was paraded past them.

That night, the only thing that she accomplished was the placing of the cameras before the chief whisked her and his other katahua off to his hut.&nbsp; He fucked them both as they assisted him.&nbsp; The one who was not being fucked would suckle on the other&#8217;s breasts or kiss her.

Jill fell easily back into the routine of the tribe.&nbsp; Again, she helped with the cooking and weaving.&nbsp; And again, she let the youngsters suckle on her luscious breasts.

On her second day, she was given her leopard spots.&nbsp; Several women were assigned to decorate her.&nbsp; They had made a black dye and dabbed it onto her skin.&nbsp; They created an intricate pattern of spots that went from her left shoulder diagonally down her torso.&nbsp; The inner swells of her breasts were spotted but the outer swells were not.&nbsp; Once the spots reached her right hip, they were continued down her leg.&nbsp; Jill did not have a mirror so she could not properly examine herself but she could tell just by looking down at herself that she must look striking with these decorations.&nbsp; She just hoped that the dye would eventually wear off.

The chief was very pleased with the new look.&nbsp; He was so pleased, in fact, that he couldn&#8217;t wait to get Jill back to his hut.&nbsp; So, he bent Jill over and fucked her in the middle of the village with all of the women and children circled around them as an audience.

Hal arrived three days later.&nbsp; The chief was badly injured as was his other katahua.&nbsp; Leopard Girl was gone.

To be continued










Chapter 10

It had been the worst night of her life.&nbsp; The other tribe had returned, this time under the cover of darkness.&nbsp; They had crept into the village and gone directly to the chief&#8217;s hut.&nbsp; They silently entered and then attacked.

Jill had tried to cry out for help but she had been silenced by a hand over her mouth.&nbsp; She struggled and jabbed her elbows back, trying to hurt the raider who held her but two others quickly grabbed her flailing arms.&nbsp; She watched with horror as the others stabbed their blades into the chief and his other main girl, knowing surely that they had been murdered.&nbsp; And then she was carried back to the beach where she was bound and stuffed into a canoe.

She remained that way through the night as the men paddled.&nbsp; She sobbed as she thought about her poor chief and wondered if this would have happened if she had not been there.&nbsp; This was another reason not to do immersion research.&nbsp; She would add this to her next lecture�. if she got out of this alive.

She tried to protest several times but each time she did, she was savagely kicked by the male in the back of the canoe.&nbsp; She lifted her head to see if she could tell where they were or where they were going.&nbsp; The male in the front of the canoe smashed his paddle down on top of her head, almost causing her to pass out.&nbsp; She remained silent and very still after that.&nbsp; They arrived at their destination at mid morning.

One male grabbed her under the armpits while a second one grabbed her bound ankles.&nbsp; They carried her to the sand and then dumped her unceremoniously onto the ground.&nbsp; A rope was tied to the rope binding her ankles and then she was dragged several hundred yards into their village.

There was a lot of whooping and hollering and many of the males pranced around her prone body in a kind of war dance or victory celebration.&nbsp; This tribe also spoke Incunu so she could make out that she was a war prize and now was their slave.&nbsp; There was an argument about who would own her but one of the males tabled the debate and declared that the chief would decide.

Jill was dragged to her feet and led to a post.&nbsp; Her wrists were untied and then raised above her head and tied to the top of the pole.&nbsp; They untied her ankles and pulled her legs apart, tying them to stakes that had been sunk in the ground.&nbsp; She was left in the hot sun, vulnerable and exposed, stretched tightly, and utterly defenseless.&nbsp; The mighty Leopard Girl was now a lowly slave.&nbsp; She sobbed with tears rolling down her cheeks.

Throughout the day, she was raped and brutally treated.&nbsp; Any male that walked by took advantage of her helplessness and fucked her.&nbsp; Even boys availed themselves of her charms, although some of them had to pull over a log to stand on to reach her pussy.&nbsp; The women, who wore loincloths in this tribe, unlike her own tribe, seemed to enjoy tormenting her breasts.&nbsp; None of them were very well endowed themselves and seemed to be fascinated with the large breasts of the redheaded white woman.&nbsp; She inherited a new name from one of the women and it gained acceptance among the rest of the tribe.&nbsp; She was now &#8220;Spotted Udders.&#8221;

The women sucked on the luscious breasts and spanked them and punched them.&nbsp; Some grabbed her nipples and stretched them away from her chest while others bounced them up and down, seemingly amused by how they jiggled.

This tribe might share a common language with her own tribe, that that was where the similarity ended.&nbsp; They were crude and rude and brutal.&nbsp; She saw nothing of the loving, caring tenderness that she so admired in her own tribe.

At the end of the day, a coffle of other slaves was paraded back into the village, led by two males with bows and machetes.&nbsp; Jill assumed that all of them were also slaves and she saw that all of them were women.&nbsp; They were also attractive women and several of them were indeed beautiful.&nbsp; Two of them were oriental, probably Japanese.&nbsp; Four of them were black.&nbsp; And five of them were white, although they were darkly tanned now.&nbsp; Their bodies were fit, probably from working, and they were all naked but for the rope that led from one to another and was tied around their necks and the ropes that bound their wrists together.

Jill was finally released from the post and was tied at the end of the coffle.&nbsp; Then the coffle was led into the jungle.&nbsp; Jill wanted to ask questions but did not want to incur the wrath of the guards, so she remained silent.&nbsp; She could ask questions later.

They reached a clearing where three large cages sat on the ground.&nbsp; The girls were released one by one and pushed roughly into the cages until each one held four naked females.&nbsp; The cages were then lifted by ropes slung over tree limbs until all three cages were about six feet off the ground.&nbsp; Then the guards left.

&#8220;How long will they leave us here?&#8221; asked Jill.&nbsp; Most of the other women did not speak English but two did.&nbsp; One of the Orientals was from California and one of the brunettes was from England.

&#8220;Until morning,&#8221; replied the Californian.

&#8220;But what about food?&#8221; asked Jill.

&#8220;We get fed in the morning and then again in the middle of the afternoon.&nbsp; We go to bed hungry.&nbsp; It&#8217;s like that every day.&#8221;

&#8220;Oh god,&#8221; groaned Jill.&nbsp; &#8220;I haven&#8217;t eaten since yesterday.&nbsp; I&#8217;m so hungry.&#8221;

&#8220;Sorry, hun,&#8221; consoled the Brit who was in the same cage as Jill.&nbsp; &#8220;That&#8217;s the way they do things here.&nbsp; Every day it&#8217;s the same.&#8221;

Jill had tons of questions and the two English speakers did their best to answer them.&nbsp; She learned that they worked each day picking fruit which the tribe sold to the mainland.&nbsp; Each morning, a boat arrived on the other side of the island to collect what was picked the day before.

She learned that Jackie, the Oriental, had been a student working on an archaeological dig on a nearby island when she had been captured.&nbsp; The others in her party had been killed during the raid.&nbsp; She had been the sole survivor and had been taken into slavery.

&#8220;How long ago was that?&#8221; asked Jill.

&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; replied Jackie.&nbsp; &#8220;A long time ago.&nbsp; Maybe two years?&#8221;&nbsp; Jill groaned at that news.&nbsp; These people played for keeps.&nbsp; Everything seemed so hopeless.

Emily was the Brit and she had been vacationing with her husband.&nbsp; They had rented a sailboat and had made the mistake of anchoring for the night in one of the island&#8217;s many coves.&nbsp; The tribe had boarded their boat, taken it to deep water, and scuttled it.&nbsp; She was taken into slavery.

&#8220;What happened to your husband?&#8221; Jill asked.&nbsp; &#8220;Did he survive?&#8221;

&#8220;For a little bit,&#8221; Emily replied.&nbsp; &#8220;Then they ate him.&#8221;

Jill gasped.&nbsp; &#8220;Ohmigod!!!&#8221;

&#8220;They have no use for males other than as a food source.&nbsp; They eat all of the ones that they catch.&#8221;

Jill gasped again.&nbsp; &#8220;That&#8217;s horrible!!!&#8221; she groaned.&nbsp; These people were definitely not like her tribe.

Jill gave Emily a hug, trying to console her over the loss of her husband.&nbsp; After Emily told her how they had disemboweled and roasted him, she could not believe that the petite, brunette was holding up so well.&nbsp; But she supposed that time healed all wounds, as her grandmother used to say. She just hoped that time would heal the wounds of the loss of her chief and of her freedom.

They talked for a bit longer and then one of the males from the tribe walked past the cages.&nbsp; He shouted for them to be quiet and sleep.&nbsp; Jill shouted back in Incunu.&nbsp; &#8220;We are too hungry to sleep.&nbsp; Bring us your chief to eat.&#8221;

The male laughed and banged his bow against the cage, telling them again to sleep.&nbsp; The girls in the cages all turned to Jill in amazement.&nbsp; &#8220;You speak this language?&#8221;

&#8220;Yes, of course I do,&#8221; she replied.

&#8220;But how?&#8221; they asked.&nbsp; &#8220;And why have you only been speaking English?&#8221;

&#8220;English is my native tongue,&#8221; she explained.&nbsp; &#8220;And it never occurred to me that any of you would understand Incunu.&#8221;&nbsp; All of them did speak the local language but one.&nbsp; The beautiful blonde did not speak Incunu or English.&nbsp; Emily explained that she thought the girl might be Russian and had been newly captured.

They spoke Incunu from then on.&nbsp; They all wanted to know how Jill came to be captive with them.&nbsp; She did not know how much she could trust all of the girls so she only told them part of the story.

&#8220;I was asleep,&#8221; she started.&nbsp; &#8220;I was sleeping soundly with my chief.&nbsp; They sneaked up on us, killed my chief and killed my sister.&nbsp; They took me and brought me here.&#8221;

&#8220;Are you a katahua?&#8221; asked one of the girl.

&#8220;Yes,&#8221; replied Jill.&nbsp; &#8220;I am katahua.&#8221;&nbsp; This caused several of the girls to gasp in unison.&nbsp; It was unheard of for a tribe to steal a katahua from another tribe.&nbsp; It was even more unheard of for a katahua to be a white girl.

&#8220;I&#8217;m surprised,&#8221; said Jackie.&nbsp; &#8220;They always just raid to get native girls.&nbsp; They use them as nursemaids and breeders.&nbsp; I have never known them to raid for a white girl.&nbsp; They just end up with us by accident and then just use us for labor.&#8221;

&#8220;Maybe it was too dark for them to tell the difference,&#8221; replied Jill.&nbsp; &#8220;They are probably regretting their decision.&#8221;

&#8220;Well, it&#8217;s for certain they won&#8217;t use you sexually,&#8221; said Emily.&nbsp; &#8220;They use the native girls freely but they have no interest in us.&#8221;

Jill just stared at her incredulously.&nbsp; After having been continually raped by every male between the ages of ten and seventy, she couldn&#8217;t believe that Emily could say something like that.&nbsp; &#8220;Then what exactly would you call what they did to me today?&#8221; asked Jill.

&#8220;What did they do to you?&#8221;

&#8220;They raped me!&#8221; exclaimed Jill.&nbsp; &#8220;All of them did!&nbsp; Over and over again!!!&#8221;

&#8220;Wow,&#8221; responded Emily.&nbsp; &#8220;I have no idea what is going on.&#8221;

The next day was a repeat for Jill.&nbsp; The twelve of them were fed and the other eleven were marched off to pick fruit for the day.&nbsp; Jill was taken back to the post in the center of the village and bound the same way she had been the day before.&nbsp; Then the raping started anew.

It was harder this day.&nbsp; On her first day, adrenalin had been rushing through her veins from the capture and the uncertainty that lay ahead of her.&nbsp; That must have caused some form of arousal because she had been lubricated.&nbsp; Today, there was no excitement or arousal; only dread.&nbsp; She was dry.&nbsp; The first male to use her found out the hard way.&nbsp; He tried to plunge into her but could only get in an inch before her dry vaginal walls abraded his cock painfully.&nbsp; He kept trying but finally gave up, slapping Jill across the cheek and making her see stars.

A second male tried with the same results and she was slapped hard again.&nbsp; Then, one of the women had an idea.&nbsp; She picked up a banana and coated it with coconut oil.&nbsp; She jammed it roughly into Jill&#8217;s sex, causing her to cry out but the woman managed to get it all the way in.&nbsp; Then she pulled it out, coated it again, and sank it home again.&nbsp; This time, she pumped it in and out a few times before declaring that the girl was ready.&nbsp; Then she was raped and raped and raped throughout the day.&nbsp; The coconut oil did the trick for the first one.&nbsp; After that, the semen from predecessors provided ample lubrication for those who followed.

To Jill, it seemed to be just an exercise in humiliation.&nbsp; The males did not show any real interest in her.&nbsp; She suspected that they were just doing the job they had been assigned.&nbsp; Some of the boys seemed to show at least a little interest because they suckled on her full breasts as they pumped their tiny cocks into her.&nbsp; The women were like the men.&nbsp; They abused her breasts but did not really play with them.&nbsp; They would slap them or punch them as they passed by on their way to do something more important.

Each day, this routine was repeated and each night she was returned to the cage where the other girls comforted her.&nbsp; They also comforted each other and the gentle sounds of love making filled the air in their clearing in the jungle.&nbsp; Nobody tried to have sex with Jill, though.&nbsp; She obviously had enough sexual activity during the day.

On the fourth night of her captivity, she finally told the girls the rest of her story.&nbsp; She told them about the raid.&nbsp; &#8220;I don&#8217;t know if this is the same tribe that raided us, but I assume it is.&nbsp; I think they are just seeking vengeance.&#8221;

The other girl gained newfound respect for their fellow slave.&nbsp; Not only was she a katahua, which placed her near the top of the pecking order, but she was also Leopard Girl.&nbsp; Everyone pitched in to make her life as comfortable as possible when she wasn&#8217;t being brutally raped.

Jill lost track of the days but she knew that it had been over a week since she had been captured.&nbsp; Still, they continued her nonstop rapings every day and she wondered if this would be her lot for the rest of her life.&nbsp; Surely they would grow tired of her body at some point.&nbsp; But what would happen then?&nbsp; Would they kill her or just have her become a fruit collector?


Chapter 11

It was shortly after midday and one of the youth had his cock imbedded in her vagina which had already been lubricated with the sperm of over a dozen other males.&nbsp; She looked down and saw the boy suckling on her breast and thought about her nursing duties back in her tribe.&nbsp; How different the tribes were, she thought again.

All of a sudden, she heard arrows whizzing by her and saw a male go down nearby.&nbsp; Two more males quickly fell and she heard one of them cry out for help.&nbsp; Another male approached her with a drawn knife and told the boy to back away.&nbsp; She knew that this was the end of her.&nbsp; He held the blade to her throat but then cried out.&nbsp; She saw the arrow sticking through his neck as he crumpled to the ground.

The sound of stampeding feet was heard behind her but when she craned her neck around, she couldn&#8217;t see anything.&nbsp; Then, suddenly, they burst into the village from all sides.&nbsp; She recognized them immediately and breathed a sigh of relief.&nbsp; Her tribe had come to rescue her.

Arrows were still flying and the males of the other tribe were falling quickly.&nbsp; The raid had been a complete surprise and they had no time to prepare to defend.&nbsp; Then, the chief appeared before her and she fainted.&nbsp; She had seen him murdered in his hut!&nbsp; There was no way that he could be here.

When she awoke, she was lying on a sleeping mat and was free of her bindings.&nbsp; The chief was standing above her with his arms crossed and was smiling down at her.&nbsp; A large bandage was wrapped around his chest and others were wound around an arm and a thigh.&nbsp; &#8220;I came for my Leopard Girl,&#8221; he said.&nbsp; Hal was standing beside him with his bow still in his hand.

&#8220;Thank the gods,&#8221; she uttered.&nbsp; She started to get up but the chief placed his foot on her chest, pushing her back down to protect her as she had done to him during the first raid.

&#8220;Not yet, my katahua.&nbsp; They already tried to kill you once.&nbsp; Stay down until we have cleared their nest.&#8221;&nbsp; The chief continued to scan the village, seeing his tribe chasing the other and seeing some of the enemy escaping into the jungle.&nbsp; Finally, when he deemed it to be safe, he took his foot off of her.

Jill scrambled to her feet and gave her chief a hug, which caused him to wince.&nbsp; &#8220;Sorry.&nbsp; I wasn&#8217;t thinking,&#8221; she said.&nbsp; &#8220;But thank you for rescuing me, my savior.&#8221;

&#8220;Nobody takes my property, girl,&#8221; he replied.&nbsp; And for once, she was delighted to be considered property.

After they cleared the village, the chief declared that it was time to return home.&nbsp; Jill remembered the other girls and asked that they be rescued.&nbsp; The chief was not interested in any more foreign girls.&nbsp; But when Jill picked up a bow and a quiver of arrows from a fallen enemy and started to head out of camp to rescue the girls herself, he relented.

Jill had no idea where to find the girls so they wandered for a bit.&nbsp; Eventually, however, they did spot them in a little valley, collecting berries and being guarded by a dozen or so warriors.&nbsp; The chief created a plan and everyone got into position.&nbsp; Again, Jill was allowed to fight.

And again, they had the element of surprise in their favor.&nbsp; The first three guards went down before they knew what was happening.&nbsp; Another one fled into the jungle.&nbsp; But the others stood their ground and fought.&nbsp; Another guard was killed as the skirmishing continued.

Finally, it became clear to the guards that they were outnumbered and were about to lose.&nbsp; One of the guards grabbed Emily and held a knife to her throat, obviously trying to use her to bargain with or as a human shield.

This infuriated Jill and she broke from cover and raced toward the guard, shrieking out a war cry.&nbsp; The guard stood his ground and pressed the blade tighter against Emily&#8217;s throat, slicing the skin and causing Emily to cry out.&nbsp; Seeing the little trickle of blood dripping down Emily&#8217;s neck was all it took for Jill.&nbsp; She nocked her arrow and aimed, watching the arrow go cleanly through the center of the guard&#8217;s forehead.

Once again, a naked woman with breasts bobbing wildly had led an attack.&nbsp; And once again, she had been victorious.&nbsp; The only difference was that this time, the woman wore leopard spots.&nbsp; The other enemy quickly fled into the safety of the jungle.

Emily fainted from the ordeal and from seeing Jill&#8217;s arrow coming at her.&nbsp; Jill got to her just in time to catch her and gently laid her on the ground.&nbsp; The other slavegirls quickly surrounded Jill and jabbered quickly and loudly, thanking her for rescuing them.&nbsp; She smiled and then went to her chief who was standing nearby.&nbsp; &#8220;These are the ones who rescued you.&nbsp; This is my tribe.&#8221;

Again, there was a flurry of Incunu thank-yous as the girls started jabbering again.&nbsp; Emily came to and was helped to her feet, touching her body all over to figure out where the arrow had pierced her.

&#8220;You have to stop doing that,&#8221; scolded the chief.

&#8220;Sorry, my savior,&#8221; replied Jill as she sank to her knees and kissed his hand.&nbsp; &#8220;I don&#8217;t know what gets into me.&#8221;

&#8220;It&#8217;s the leopard inside of you,&#8221; he said.&nbsp; &#8220;But try to be more careful from now on.&#8221;

&#8220;Yes, my savior.&#8221;


Chapter 12

They had not brought enough canoes for the party that they were returning with so they relieved the enemy village of some of theirs.&nbsp; The girls were divided up amongst the canoes and were each paired with an Incunu warrior.&nbsp; They were also enlisted to share in the paddling.

Jill rode with the chief and one other Incunu.&nbsp; Because of the chief&#8217;s wounds, he was unable to do any of the paddling himself.&nbsp; They set off on the long journey home.

&#8220;I thought you were dead, my savior,&#8221; said Jill as they started their trip.

&#8220;I was hurt but I lived.&nbsp; Your sister lived also but she was hurt badly.&#8221;

Jill breathed a sigh of relief to know that her katahua sister was also alive.&nbsp; It was turning out to be a happy ending.&nbsp; The chief sat facing Jill.&nbsp; He loved watching her muscles straining and her breasts swaying with every movement.&nbsp; He knew that he had the best katahua in the world.

&#8220;What are you going to do with your new girls?&#8221; he asked.

&#8220;Oh, I hadn&#8217;t thought about it,&#8221; she responded.&nbsp; &#8220;But they aren&#8217;t my girls.&#8221;

&#8220;You led the attack,&#8221; he said.&nbsp; &#8220;You claimed them.&nbsp; They belong to you now.&#8221;

&#8220;Wait!&#8221; she said after his words sank in.&nbsp; &#8220;I didn&#8217;t think that women could own anything.&#8221;

&#8220;Leopard Girl is no ordinary woman,&#8221; he replied.&nbsp; &#8220;Leopard Girl can own whatever she claims.&#8221;

&#8220;Oh,&#8221; replied Jill.&nbsp; Now she knew for sure that her immersion into their culture was changing it.&nbsp; &#8220;I think that I should release them.&#8221;

&#8220;That decision is yours,&#8221; he responded.&nbsp; &#8220;But be careful.&nbsp; Some of them might not want to be released.&nbsp; And some of them might not be ready to return to their other lives.&#8221;

&#8220;Oh,&#8221; was all she said.&nbsp; They rode in silence for a long time and the chief just watched the breasts swaying back and forth with a smile on his face.

By the time they reached their island, Jill decided on a course of action.&nbsp; She would offer them a choice.&nbsp; Each one could decide for herself.&nbsp; They could be released and return to their former lives.&nbsp; Or they could remain with the Incunu.&nbsp; She could not imagine any of them staying behind but, if they chose to, they could stay as long as they agreed to live as the Incunu did.

Jill gathered the girls in front of the chief&#8217;s hut.&nbsp; It was the first time she had entered the village without having her wrists bound behind her back.&nbsp; All of the others were bound.&nbsp; She explained their options with her hands on her hips.&nbsp; She was not quite sure how to describe it to the Russian girl but she would deal with that later.&nbsp; She spoke in the Incunu tongue to the others.

Most of them were excited and grateful to Jill.&nbsp; Not only had she rescued them from that awful tribe but she was giving them back their freedom.&nbsp; Transportation was quickly arranged for nine of them and clothing was made so that they could at least travel.&nbsp; Hal arranged a satellite connection with the university and was able to get another professor to translate for the Russian.&nbsp; She too decided to return home and she was quickly sent on her way.&nbsp; Only Emily decided to stay.&nbsp; She said that she had no life to return to.&nbsp; Jill decided not to push her.&nbsp; She said that the cute little Brit could stay with the tribe until it was time for Jill to leave.&nbsp; Then Jill would ask her again.&nbsp; She could go home or remain permanently with the tribe.

&#8220;Now you have a katauha, Leopard Girl,&#8221; said the chief after the Russian had been sent on her way.

Jill blinked.&nbsp; &#8220;I do?&#8221; she asked incredulously.&nbsp; &#8220;What about me?&#8221;

&#8220;Oh, you are still my katahua,&#8221; he smiled as he reached out and held her breasts.&nbsp; &#8220;But now you have your own.&nbsp; I hope you will share her with me.&#8221;

&#8220;Of course I will, my savior,&#8221; she responded.&nbsp; In actuality, she was eager to share Emily with the chief.&nbsp; Her sister katahua would be out of action for several more weeks.&nbsp; And Jill&#8217;s sex was still raw from the week of nonstop rapes.&nbsp; It would be several more days before she would be able to service the chief.

Emily turned out to be an energetic sexual partner.&nbsp; It had been quite some time since she had felt a cock and she enthusiastically impaled herself on the chief&#8217;s at every opportunity.&nbsp; Jill loved watching and, as s dutiful katahua, she assisted with the coupling.&nbsp; She would grasp the chief&#8217;s cock and guide it into her own katahua and then would play with Emily&#8217;s breasts or asshole or clit while they fucked.

When they got back to the village, Hal had recommended that they cut the trip short and return home.&nbsp; He knew that Jill must be traumatized by her ordeal.&nbsp; Jill would have nothing to do with that idea, though.&nbsp; In fact, she insisted on extending the trip to make up for the time she had lost while being held prisoner.&nbsp; Hal was easily persuaded.&nbsp; He was very much enjoying his own katahua and had expanded his harem during Jill&#8217;s captivity.&nbsp; His sperm was being thoroughly drained by his girls.

But eventually it did become time to leave.&nbsp; Jill&#8217;s spots had faded but were not completely gone.&nbsp; She would just have to pick her wardrobe carefully once she got back to the university.&nbsp; The spots on her legs meant that she would probably be wearing a lot of pantsuits for the foreseeable future.

Emily was torn in her decision.&nbsp; She still felt that she had no life to return to.&nbsp; She did like the tribe and was inclined to stay there.&nbsp; But what she really wanted was to go with Jill and continue to be her katahua.&nbsp; She had grown to love Leopard Girl.

Jill could not imagine how that would work.&nbsp; She already had a husband.&nbsp; She already had an owner.&nbsp; How could she own someone herself?

Hal solved the problem by offering to own Emily.&nbsp; Emily was delighted that she would be able to remain near Jill.&nbsp; Hal was delighted because he would be able to own the beautiful little Brit.&nbsp; He had not yet even sampled her charms but he had listened to her sexual performances with the chief and knew that she must be a little spitfire in bed.&nbsp; Jill was not delighted but she was happy for Emily that she had come up with a solution that would make her happy.&nbsp; Plus, this solution would relieve Jill of some of the burden of servicing the very horny Hal.

Two days before they were to depart, another boy was initiated into manhood.&nbsp; Jill watched Emily&#8217;s reaction as the chief held Jill in front of him and toyed with her breasts.&nbsp; That seemed to be his favorite pastime during these rituals.&nbsp; Jill had to chuckle a few times as she saw Emily&#8217;s eyes fly wide open at times or saw her face scrunch up in a grimace.&nbsp; Then, after the vigil on the point, the chief recommended to Jill that she have her own katahua complete the initiation.

Jill pointed out that Emily did not yet fully understand the culture.&nbsp; He only replied that &#8220;she sure knows how to fuck, though.&nbsp; The boy will be a man by the time she&#8217;s finished with him�&nbsp; if he survives.&#8221;&nbsp; Emily and the boy were both grinning from ear to ear when she brought him back to the center of the village at the end of the day.

The day that they left, the chief had another surprise for Jill.&nbsp; He had Jill&#8217;s spots freshened, much to her dismay.&nbsp; Just as they were fading, she was to be marked anew.&nbsp; But she could not refuse.&nbsp; The spots were meant as an honor and it would be an insult to refuse.&nbsp; She wished she had brought different outfits to travel in, though.&nbsp; She had an open neck blouse and a skirt.&nbsp; Some of the spots on her chest were visible, as were the ones running down her leg.&nbsp; She had given her other travel outfit to Emily but it was no more concealing.&nbsp; She would just have to endure the stares along the way.


Chapter 13

Fresh posters of Leopard Girl adorned the campus when they returned.&nbsp; Either Hal had sent pictures ahead of time, which she could easily imagine him doing, or someone had hacked into the server.&nbsp; Either way, the damage was done.&nbsp; It showed her standing authoritatively with her hands on her hips.&nbsp; The leopard spots were clearly seen running diagonally across her naked body and down her leg.&nbsp; Her hair was a wild mane of red.&nbsp; The backs of other naked girls of various sizes and colors could be seen in front of her.&nbsp; This picture had obviously been taken when she was telling her girls about their opportunity for freedom.

Again, her lecture halls were filled to overflowing.&nbsp; She gave up her plan to hide her spots since everyone had already seen them in the poster and just wore whatever she felt like.&nbsp; She also decided to get back to combing her hair more slowly than she did after her first trip.&nbsp; She would occasionally comb out her locks but, on most days, wore her hair as the wild mane she had on the island.

She had a lot of adjustments to make.&nbsp; At first, she was having difficulty getting back to wearing clothes.&nbsp; She had grown accustomed to being naked during her latest trip and enjoyed the freedom.&nbsp; Her clothes chafed and irritated her for the first week.&nbsp; The shoes were especially bad and the bras were like torture.&nbsp; She gave up wearing both and could be seen walking barefoot through the campus with her large, heavy breasts moving seductively beneath her blouse or jacket.

Having the freedom of her hands was another adjustment.&nbsp; They had been bound behind her back almost the entire time she was on the island.&nbsp; Now she never knew what to do with them.&nbsp; Her solution was to just clasp her hands behind her back as she walked or stood.&nbsp; This delighted the males and some of the females on campus because it thrust her delicious breasts forward, making them even more prominent than they were before.

But the worst adjustment was the cameras.&nbsp; Everyone seemed to have one and all of the lenses seemed to be pointed at her.&nbsp; It was like being constantly surrounded by paparazzi.

She did settle back into her old life with those minor adjustments, though.&nbsp; She was once again Dr. Wallings and was not sure that Leopard Girl would ever reemerge.

Emily took up residence at Hal&#8217;s and became a consistent addition to the club&#8217;s gatherings.&nbsp; Jill was surprised at how easily Emily adjusted to her life as a slavegirl, but she did seem to take to it readily.

Jill had taken a shine to the cute British girl.&nbsp; She was always so enthusiastic about everything and took delight in every new discovery and adventure.&nbsp; Jill supposed that kind of thing happened to some people after all that Emily had been through.&nbsp; Either they would be thrown into a deep depression or they would get a new lease on life.&nbsp; Emily definitely was the latter and she was living life to the fullest.

She also turned out to be a favorite at the hunts.&nbsp; Jill and Charity were still highly prized but so was Emily.&nbsp; Jill found it amusing that, at Emily&#8217;s first hunt, five different hunters had been stalking her.&nbsp; As she stepped into a clearing, all five shot her.&nbsp; She was a multicolor mess and an argument broke out among the hunters over who should own her. Finally, a judge was called in to sort it out.&nbsp; But even that didn&#8217;t help.&nbsp; When Emily said that she couldn&#8217;t tell what part of her body had been hit first and that it felt like all of the shots hit her at the same time, she was cleaned up and sent out to be bagged again.

It took no time for another hunter to claim her and she was the first catch of the day.&nbsp; As entertainment that night, she was mounted by a Great Dane and fucked before the audience.&nbsp; She was thrilled by the exciting day and climaxed twice during the bestiality and countless other times when she was alone with the master who had claimed her for the night.

One of the advantages of having Emily around was that Jill was not summoned nearly as often.&nbsp; Apparently, Emily was keeping Hal sufficiently satisfied sexually.&nbsp; And her husband was rarely called.&nbsp; Every five or six weeks, he would be summoned and used but Jill was convinced that this was just to remind him who the boss was.&nbsp; As a result of Emily&#8217;s presence, Jill&#8217;s life returned to near normalcy.

But it wasn&#8217;t completely normal.&nbsp; While Hal may not have used her as frequently, he still exercised his property rights over her and would often loan her to other dominants.&nbsp; He even threatened to loan her outside of the circle of dominant friends.&nbsp; One time, when she was arguing with him over something, he told her to shut up or he would loan her to one of the fraternities on campus.&nbsp; That ended the argument immediately.

But life was starting to become more normal.&nbsp; She could have her Saturday picnics or go sailing with her husband.&nbsp; It was as good as it could get until their term of slavery ended two years from now.

Chapter 14

Janice was one of the first dominants to borrow Jill.&nbsp; It was Charity&#8217;s birthday and she wanted to give her niece a surprise present.&nbsp; When Charity woke up on that Saturday, she found a very tightly bound and gagged Jill in bed with her.&nbsp; Pinned to one of the ropes was the gift card.&nbsp; &#8220;Happy birthday, sweetie.&nbsp; Enjoy your present.&nbsp; She belongs to you until Sunday night.&nbsp; Love.&nbsp; Your Mistress.&#8221;

Charity squealed with delight and quickly unwrapped her present and then retied Jill spread eagle across the bed.&nbsp; She left the gag in so that Jill would not protest, even though Jill would have been unlikely to protest.&nbsp; Then she feasted on her beautiful Leopard Girl, bringing her to orgasm after orgasm until mid afternoon.

Finally, she took out the gag and kissed her beautiful gift.&nbsp; &#8220;Are you trying to kill me?&#8221; asked Jill once she could speak.

Charity silenced her with another kiss before replying.&nbsp; &#8220;You belong to me, Pussy Girl,&#8221; she giggled.&nbsp; &#8220;I can do whatever I want.&#8221;

&#8220;But I won&#8217;t survive many more orgasms.&#8221;

Charity laughed.&nbsp; &#8220;Then my mistress will just have to buy me a new present if my love for you kills you.&#8221;&nbsp; Then Charity dove between Jill&#8217;s thighs again and licked and nibbled her to another orgasm.

Charity was hungry and went down to the kitchen to get some food.&nbsp; She left Jill bound where she was, though, stretched widely on the bed.&nbsp; Her aunt was sitting in the kitchen, reading, when she arrived.

&#8220;How&#8217;s your present?&#8221; asked Janice as Charity entered.

&#8220;It&#8217;s my best birthday ever, Mistress,&#8221; replied the naked Charity.&nbsp; She went to the table and hugged and kissed her aunt.&nbsp; &#8220;Thank you so much.&nbsp; I just love her.&#8221;

&#8220;I&#8217;m glad you like your gift,&#8221; smiled Janice.&nbsp; &#8220;Are you going to keep her tied up all weekend?&#8221;

&#8220;Maybe,&#8221; giggled Charity.&nbsp; &#8220;I just love playing with her body.&#8221;

&#8220;Yes, she has a marvelous body.&nbsp; I hope you&#8217;ll share it with me later.&#8221;

Charity stopped what she was doing and turned to her aunt with a surprised look on her face.&nbsp; &#8220;Oh, Mistress, of course you can play with her.&nbsp; I assumed that since you own me, that everything I own belongs to you.&#8221;

Janice smiled and got up from the table, crossing the floor to her niece.&nbsp; She lifted each beautiful breast in her hands and kissed the soft upper swells before kissing Charity on the lips.&nbsp; &#8220;Thank you.&nbsp; I think I would like to play with her.&nbsp; Maybe later.&#8221;

&#8220;Yes, Mistress,&#8221; replied Charity.&nbsp; She finished creating a plate full of fruit and then returned to where Jill was still bound.&nbsp; She placed a raspberry on each of the leopard spots which, by now, were fading.&nbsp; She stuffed a half dozen apple slices into Jill&#8217;s sex and then peeled a banana, stuffing it in with the apple pieces.&nbsp; Jill shuddered when she saw the banana, remembering the gang rapes when she was a prisoner of the warring tribe but did not say anything.

Charity sat on the bed beside Jill and fed her new slavegirl the remaining fruit from the plate.&nbsp; When Jill had finished eating, Charity went from spot to spot, licking sensually around each with her tongue before sucking the raspberries into her mouth.&nbsp; Charity was only half way through the berries when Jill started moaning.&nbsp; Charity continued her feast.

When the berries were gone, she laid between Jill&#8217;s bound legs and started sucking on her sex, using her tongue to try to scoop out the fruit.&nbsp; When that did not work, she worked a finger in to get them and Jill&#8217;s moaning intensified.&nbsp; Charity would trap a piece of fruit, eat it, and then wrap her lips around Jill&#8217;s clit which was very erect at this point.&nbsp; She would pulse it between her lips several times before going in search of another piece of fruit.

Jill was groaning and writhing in her bonds by the time Charity got the last piece of fruit out.&nbsp; Charity was not about to put her out of her agony by letting her climax just yet, though.&nbsp; She had one more thing that she wanted to do.&nbsp; She had never fisted a woman before and today she would do it for the first time.

She had been fisted several times and she knew that, if done right, it could be very erotic and pleasurable.&nbsp; She slipped two fingers into Jill and twisted them, eliciting another groan.&nbsp; Then a third finger joined in.&nbsp; When the fourth one entered, Jill realized what was happening and protested.

&#8220;Hey!&nbsp; What do you think you&#8217;re doing down there?&#8221; she said as she lifted her head and peered down across her naked form at her young captor.

&#8220;Just playing with my Pussy Girl&#8217;s pussy,&#8221; Charity giggled.

&#8220;Well it wasn&#8217;t designed for that,&#8221; exclaimed Jill.

&#8220;Oh, it was designed for pleasure,&#8221; replied Charity as her thumb joined the crowd of fingers.&nbsp; Slowly, she pumped her fingers in and out, noticing how aroused Jill was.&nbsp; The beautiful professor was groaning even louder now.&nbsp; The fingers moved a little deeper with each push.&nbsp; &#8220;Besides, my hand is a lot smaller than that guy&#8217;s was who fisted me.&#8221;

Jill gasped as Charity&#8217;s hand stretched her wide and protested again.&nbsp; But Charity just kept moving her hand in and out of the slippery wet tunnel until, finally, her whole hand was inside of her temporary slave.

Jill took a deep breath and then panted as she felt her vagina stuffed to fullness.&nbsp; She took another deep breath and panted almost as if she were in labor.&nbsp; The fingers spread out inside of her body and she could feel them exploring their new home.&nbsp; She pulled on the ropes holding her arms to try to pull herself higher to escape the fingered invasion but the ropes holding her legs held her tightly in place.

Charity took her time.&nbsp; She believed that she could make Jill climax in a heartbeat but she wanted to prolong this exquisite agony.&nbsp; Her fingers danced along the soft, warm vaginal walls, exploring slowly every surface.&nbsp; She found her slave&#8217;s cervix and lightly tapped it with a finger, sending little shocks of pain through the captive&#8217;s body.

Jill&#8217;s brow was sweaty and she shook her head back and forth, trying to adjust to the uncomfortable fullness.&nbsp; She continued her deep breathing and panting as the fingers went back to their exploration.

Charity gazed up from her position between the bound legs.&nbsp; She just loved to look at her professor.&nbsp; Every delicate curve was so feminine and so beautiful.&nbsp; She saw the luscious, bountiful breasts jiggle as her captive tried to pull on the arm ropes.&nbsp; And she saw Jill&#8217;s belly quivering which she knew was a telltale sign that she was nearing climax.&nbsp; Charity let her hand go limp and still as she waited for Jill to relax.&nbsp; She did not want her slave to orgasm just yet.

Jill groaned.&nbsp; She had been so close.&nbsp; Now all she felt was the hand filling her sex and the wrist stretching her open.&nbsp; She tried moving her hips to start the stimulation again but it did not work.&nbsp; She was completely at the mercy of her student and temporary mistress.

Charity sensed that Jill had calmed down.&nbsp; Her breathing became more regular and her belly had stopped quivering.&nbsp; Charity decided it was time for her next move but she was still not ready to let Jill climax yet.&nbsp; She would just have to be very careful with her slave.

She curled her fingers and tucked her thumb in, forming a fist.&nbsp; Then she started pulling back.&nbsp; Her fist met resistance but she kept the pressure on, increasing the strain on Jill&#8217;s sex.&nbsp; Jill groaned as a dull pain formed between her thighs.&nbsp; Charity eased off the pressure and slowly moved her arm forward.&nbsp; Jill could feel the fist moving within her belly.&nbsp; Eventually, the knuckles touched her cervix and kept pressing forward.&nbsp; Jill groaned again as a new dull ache formed in her body and cramps radiated from her cervix.&nbsp; Finally, Charity eased off that pressure also.

Charity continued these motions.&nbsp; She would pull her hand back, causing a strain, and then push it forward until it mashed Jill&#8217;s cervix and caused the cramping.&nbsp; Slowly, she increased the rhythm and Jill felt the hand move inside of her more quickly.&nbsp; Eventually, the tempo became quick and Jill was back to her deep breathing and panting.&nbsp; It felt like her cervix was being battered almost as if Charity were trying to burst through into her womb.&nbsp; Pain radiated constantly from her pummeled cervix.

Charity saw the belly quivering again and stopped all movement.&nbsp; She tilted her head forward and blew on the slick, distended clitoris but did not touch it.&nbsp; Jill groaned again as another orgasm was denied her.

Charity waited until regular breathing was restored and the belly was still.&nbsp; Then she started her hand moving again.&nbsp; This time, she picked up where she left off and was pounding her slave&#8217;s cervix, sending pain emanating from her battered organ.

It was time for her slave to climax.&nbsp; As her fist continued to punch at Jill&#8217;s cervix, Charity&#8217;s lips formed an O.&nbsp; She leaned forward and sucked the tender nubbin between her lips and started flicking it with her tongue.&nbsp; The clit was only flicked twice when Jill started climaxing but Charity kept her motions up.&nbsp; The orgasm seemed to go on forever as Charity teased her slave.&nbsp; Then, just as she was starting to come down from her orgasm, Jill&#8217;s body erupted in a fresh one.&nbsp; Still, Charity continued.&nbsp; By the time Charity finished, she was not sure whether Jill had five orgasms or one orgasm with five peaks.&nbsp; In any event, she had been climaxing for more than four minutes.&nbsp; Jill was exhausted.

&#8220;God!&#8221; exclaimed Jill after she had mostly recovered.&nbsp; &#8220;Where did you learn that one?&#8221;

Charity nipped at Jill&#8217;s clit with her teeth, causing the bound slave to jump.&nbsp; &#8220;I just made that up.&nbsp; I wanted to see how it worked.&#8221;

&#8220;Oh, it did the trick,&#8221; said an exhausted Jill.


Chapter 15

&#8220;How&#8217;s she doing as a mistress?&#8221; asked Janice as she entered her bedroom.

&#8220;She&#8217;s pretty creative,&#8221; replied Jill who was still spread and bound on the bed.&nbsp; &#8220;She&#8217;s a good little mistress.&#8221;

Charity had been sleeping in Janice&#8217;s bed the night before so that&#8217;s where the bound Jill was placed as a present.&nbsp; Jill continued to be amazed at the unusual aunt/niece relationship.&nbsp; Apparently, it worked for them.&nbsp; She could certainly tell that they loved one another very much.&nbsp; But it must have been difficult when they were with other family members.&nbsp; She wondered how often Charity came close to calling her aunt Mistress.

Janice sat on the bed and reached out, resting her hand on Jill&#8217;s breast and giving it a squeeze.&nbsp; &#8220;These are twin miracles,&#8221; she said.&nbsp; &#8220;So what did she do that was so creative?&#8221;

&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; replied Jill at the comment.&nbsp; She looked down and saw the other woman holding her breast lovingly.&nbsp; She knew that this would be very uncomfortable for most women but it had become second nature to her.&nbsp; It was not even something that she had to resign herself to.&nbsp; She enjoyed being touched and handled and used by Janice and Charity.&nbsp; And she loved Emily&#8217;s touch too.&nbsp; &#8220;But if my breasts are miracles, there are six of them in the room, not two.&nbsp; Both of you have perfect breasts.&#8221;

&#8220;As for her creativity,&#8221; Jill continued, &#8220;I should let her tell you.&#8221;

&#8220;Here,&#8221; said Charity.&nbsp; &#8220;I&#8217;ll show you.&#8221;

&#8220;No, no, no!&#8221; gasped Jill.&nbsp; &#8220;I&#8217;ll tell her instead.&#8221;&nbsp; Charity grinned.&nbsp; Jill went on to describe the prolonged fisting and the never ending orgasm.

&#8220;You should try it, Mistress,&#8221; exclaimed Charity.&nbsp; &#8220;It was an unbelievable feeling to be inside of another body.&nbsp; And she feels like a velvet glove.&nbsp; A very wet velvet glove, but so soft and tight.&#8221;

&#8220;I think I&#8217;ll do that,&#8221; Janice said, causing Jill to tense.&nbsp; &#8220;But I think I&#8217;ll wait until tomorrow.&#8221;&nbsp; Jill breathed a sigh of relief but knew that she would be dreading Sunday.

&#8220;Can I watch?&#8221; asked Charity.

&#8220;Of course you can, sweetie,&#8221; replied Janice.&nbsp; &#8220;After all, she belongs to you.&nbsp; Now should we let her up for a bit?&nbsp; You&#8217;ve had her tied up all day.&#8221;

Charity sighed.&nbsp; &#8220;I suppose so.&nbsp; But she just looks so yummy like that.&#8221;

Janice smiled.&nbsp; &#8220;You can always tie her up again later.&#8221;&nbsp; They worked together to release Jill and she stretched.&nbsp; Charity put on jeans and a t-shirt and headed toward the door.

&#8220;Do I get to wear anything?&#8221; Jill asked.

&#8220;Of course not, silly slave,&#8221; replied Charity.&nbsp; Jill sighed.&nbsp; She was not surprised.&nbsp; She was not even disappointed.&nbsp; She had known the answer before she asked but she had to ask.

They got a snack and went out to the backyard to eat it.&nbsp; It was a cool day and Jill got a chill.&nbsp; So Charity patted her lap and Jill climbed into it.&nbsp; Charity held her slave while they ate to keep her warm.

Janice had been given a new pair of nipple clamps by her friend, Claire.&nbsp; In actuality, Claire hoped to one day put them on Janice.&nbsp; She was also a member of the club.&nbsp; And, like Hal, she hoped to someday enslave Janice and her beautiful niece.&nbsp; Janice had been planning on trying out the clamps on Charity but had not gotten around to it.&nbsp; Jill&#8217;s large breasts provided the perfect opportunity.

The clamps were both beautiful and devilish at the same time.&nbsp; When in place, a highly decorative pair of butterflies would adorn a girl&#8217;s chest.&nbsp; Janice was sure that they would look lovely on Jill.

Jill&#8217;s wrists were once again bound behind her back and Janice asked Charity to make sure that the slave&#8217;s nipples were nice and stiff.&nbsp; Charity jumped at the task and started sucking on the beautiful nipples.&nbsp; She loved having any excuse to play with Jill&#8217;s breasts or any other part of her for that matter.

Janice walked up to Jill and kissed her.&nbsp; &#8220;These might hurt.&nbsp; I haven&#8217;t ever tried them.&nbsp; They were a gift.&#8221;

&#8220;Yes, Mistress,&#8221; replied Jill.&nbsp; She was used to clamps and, by now, had also become accustomed to pain.

The clamps were opened by folding the wings together. Janice opened both clamps and placed them on the waiting nipples.&nbsp; The clamps bit into the tender little nubbins but not cruelly.&nbsp; Very slowly, the wings started opening.

Jill looked down and admired the artistic jewelry adorning her chest.&nbsp; &#8220;They are beautiful, Mistress.&#8221;

&#8220;Yes, they are.&nbsp; Beautiful jewelry for a beautiful girl.&#8221;&nbsp; Still, the clamps opened.

&#8220;Aaaaggghhhh!!!&#8221; Jill suddenly cried out as the wings were half opened.&nbsp; The mechanisms contained a tiny needle in each.&nbsp; Each needle had just penetrated the skin when Jill cried out.&nbsp; Then, as the wings continued to open, the needles were pushed deeper into the sensitive flesh.&nbsp; It was designed to hold the clamps in place so that they could be worn for an entire evening without becoming lost.&nbsp; They were also designed to inflict pain.&nbsp; Jill started her deep breathing and panting routine again as she felt the needles sinking deeper into her sensitive buds.

Jill&#8217;s nipples had been pierced but she did not usually wear her rings.&nbsp; She did not remember her original piercing to be this painful.&nbsp; She felt every bit of the needles&#8217; progress as they sank punishingly into her nipples until, finally, the wings were fully open and the needles stopped moving.

&#8220;What do you think?&#8221; Janice asked Charity.

Charity reached out and lifted both of Jill&#8217;s breasts as she carefully examined the new ornaments.&nbsp; &#8220;They look awesome!&#8221;

Then she used her thumb to push on one of the wings, tilting the clamp to one side.&nbsp; This also had the effect of moving one of the needles which shot pain through Jill&#8217;s chest, causing her to cry out.&nbsp; &#8220;She&#8217;ll have to be a very good girl when she wears these,&#8221; Charity said to her aunt.

Janice laughed.&nbsp; &#8220;Yes she will.&nbsp; I had no idea that these would be so punishing.&#8221;

Janice fixed dinner and the three of them ate together.&nbsp; It was one of the few meals at home recently where Charity was clothed.&nbsp; Jill was, of course, naked and still wearing her butterflies.

After dinner, they watched a rented movie together.&nbsp; Jill thought that it was a bit incongruous to be watching an animated family film with the other two women.&nbsp; They acted like this was just a normal Saturday night.&nbsp; She sat in Charity&#8217;s lap as Charity stroked her very wet labia and laughed at the movie.&nbsp; Maybe it really was a normal Saturday night for them.&nbsp; But the contradiction between the family oriented setting and movie and the way her body was being used and enjoyed was a bit unsettling.

They all retired to Janice&#8217;s bed after the movie ended.&nbsp; The horrid butterflies were painfully removed and then Jill&#8217;s nipples were swabbed with an antiseptic.&nbsp; They bathed together in the huge tub and then made love for hours.&nbsp; At the end, they slept with Charity in the middle, spooning against Jill&#8217;s back and Janice pressed tightly against Charity&#8217;s back.

On Sunday, they slept late and had breakfast together. Then Janice and Charity enjoyed Jill&#8217;s body throughout the day.&nbsp; For some reason, they did not let her climax.&nbsp; They brought her to the edge repeatedly but always stopped before she could orgasm.&nbsp; When she tried to finish herself off at one point, her wrists were bound behind her back again.

&#8220;Isn&#8217;t it wonderful?&#8221; asked Charity once Janice had wormed her hand into Jill&#8217;s sex and fisted her.

&#8220;You&#8217;re right,&#8221; replied Janice.&nbsp; &#8220;Soft, warm, wet velvet glove.&#8221;&nbsp; Charity coached her aunt to form a fist and, once again, Jill&#8217;s cervix was being pummeled.&nbsp; Charity used her tongue to toy with Jill&#8217;s clit but always stopped once the belly started quivering.&nbsp; Jill groaned in frustration.

Jill was given her clothes back after dinner and taken home.&nbsp; She was so horny from being denied an orgasm all day that she attacked her husband in the living room and practically raped him.&nbsp; Two more times during the night, she impaled herself until he could no longer become erect.&nbsp; Then she grabbed a vibrator and brought herself to two more orgasms before she could finally sleep.


Chapter 16

Janice tried to control her breathing and keep herself calm.&nbsp; She had seen others do this.&nbsp; There was no reason why she couldn&#8217;t.&nbsp; She crouched down and peeked through the underbrush as she tried to figure out her next move.

There had been a price for borrowing Jill for Charity&#8217;s birthday and that price had been her.&nbsp; Hal agreed to the loan of his katahua, as he now referred to Jill, on the condition that Janice agreed to become his prey for a private hunt.&nbsp; It would be only one hunter and one hunted.&nbsp; Janice accepted the offer.

It was now a week later and Janice was holding up her end of the bargain.&nbsp; Hal had drafted a loan document that laid out the terms of the loan and those of the hunt.&nbsp; Janice would own Jill for two days to do with as she pleased.&nbsp; The following Saturday, which was today, Janice would report to the ranch at eight o&#8217;clock in the morning, strip all clothes but sneakers, put on the safety goggles, and become prey.&nbsp; She would be given a thirty minute head start.&nbsp; If she evaded capture by five in the afternoon, she would be free to go.&nbsp; A single hit on the torso would mean capture.&nbsp; If she was captured before five, she would belong to Hal for the week.&nbsp; Charity would also belong to him for a week to be named later.

Since school was not in session, Janice knew that Hal would have plenty of time on his hands.&nbsp; And Janice knew that Hal had been lusting after her and Charity for over a year.&nbsp; It gave Janice plenty of motivation to avoid being shot.

Her plan was simple.&nbsp; She just hoped that it would work.&nbsp; She wanted to stay close enough that she could keep him in sight.&nbsp; She knew from her experience as a hunter that most of the slaves ran as far as they could, thinking that distance would provide them with safety.&nbsp; It did just the opposite, however, in her mind.&nbsp; It made them blind to their threats.

Janice reasoned that, as long as she could see him, she would know where not to be.&nbsp; She used her thirty minute head start.&nbsp; She ran quickly in one direction until she was safely out of sight and then circled around the back of a hill.&nbsp; She climbed the hill and laid prone to watch the hunter who wanted to get her in his sights.

She watched as Hal headed off in the direction she had initially run.&nbsp; Hal had brought Emily along, ostensibly to act as a porter.&nbsp; But there was not much to carry and all of it was stuffed in a little fanny pack around her waist.&nbsp; Other than that, her shoes and the ropes that bound her wrists behind her back, she was naked.

At that same moment, Jill was lying in bed beside her husband.&nbsp; She had just recently awakened and stretched her arms and legs.&nbsp; She was going to enjoy this day.&nbsp; It was the first Saturday in ages where she knew that she would not be summoned.&nbsp; There had been some Saturdays when she had not been summoned, but the threat of serving her owner had always been present.&nbsp; She would get to enjoy this day with her husband, just like any other young married couple.

Charity was at her computer and was typing away at her latest erotic story.&nbsp; She knew that her aunt was being hunted at this very moment and that sent mixed emotions through her.&nbsp; She thought it was very exciting that a dominant, her owner, could be hunted.&nbsp; She was not sure that had ever been done before in this group.&nbsp; She was not sure how she felt about her aunt being captured, though.&nbsp; Part of her thought that it would be very erotic for her aunt to be a slavegirl again..&nbsp; She knew that Aunt Janice had been bought at a charity auction one time by her aunt&#8217;s best friend, Claire, and she had heard Claire describe how exquisite she had been as a slavegirl.&nbsp; But Charity also knew what was at risk in the hunt.&nbsp; If her aunt became a slavegirl to Professor Bascomb, then she would belong to him for a week also.&nbsp; Despite not knowing how she felt about the hunt, she knew that her creative juices had been stirred, along with some other juices between her thighs.&nbsp; She pecked away at her keyboard.

Janice kept the small hunting party in sight and stalked it cautiously.&nbsp; She had been terrified and very tentative at first but by mid morning, she was feeling more confident.&nbsp; In fact, the longer she was prey, the more feral she felt.&nbsp; She took time when she came across a stream to drink from it.&nbsp; She never would have done that before this day.&nbsp; When she came to a pond, she scooped her hand into it to gather mud from the bottom.&nbsp; Then, she painted her body with it, forming streaks and patches to help in her camouflage. 

Janice did not have a watch but she assumed that it was near noon when the hunting party stopped for a rest.&nbsp; She watched as Hal took some food out of the fanny pack.&nbsp; He ate and fed Emily and they drank from the canteen.&nbsp; Janice knew that she should be hungry also, but she wasn&#8217;t.&nbsp; The adrenalin rushing through her body staved off any feelings of hunger that she should be feeling.

The hunting party started moving again and, once again, Janice followed.&nbsp; She made sure to stay behind them, thinking that it was unlikely that they would retrace their steps.&nbsp; By this time, she had found an old discarded and deteriorated backpack.&nbsp; She tore it apart and formed two strips of cloth.&nbsp; With the help of the roping that held the top of the backpack closed, she fashioned a crude loincloth for herself.

She kept her eyes open as she moved stealthily through the forest and around the fields.&nbsp; She picked up things that she found if she thought they would be useful.&nbsp; By this point, she had found four feathers which were now braided into her long raven hair.&nbsp; She also found a length of rusted steel wire which she thought might be useful so she coiled it and carried it with her.

She saw Hal and Emily stop again.&nbsp; They sat and drank from the canteen.&nbsp; Janice had been drinking from the streams all day and had no need to rest for water.&nbsp; She took this opportunity to use the wire.&nbsp; She wrapped it around her chest to measure it.&nbsp; Then she bent it back and forth over and over until it finally broke.&nbsp; She tore off more of the remains of the backpack and tore off two irregular looking pieces.&nbsp; Then she managed to poke holes into the deteriorated cloth and wrapped the wire around her chest again, under her armpits and above her breasts.&nbsp; She now had a bra.&nbsp; It would not support her heavy breasts when she had to occasionally sprint across a clearing but it was at least clothing.&nbsp; In actuality, it was like two bibs that draped over the full, firm orbs.

At the next stop, she tore one of the pockets from the backpack off and threaded a shorter length of wire through it.&nbsp; She attached this to the cord around her waist.&nbsp; Now she had her own fanny pack to put anything that she collected in.

A little later, Hal turned and started heading toward the ranch house.&nbsp; Janice&#8217;s spirits soared.&nbsp; Maybe he had given up.&nbsp; She followed at a respectable distance and ended up back on top of the hill where she had started, lying prone.&nbsp; She saw him go to his car.&nbsp; Emily&#8217;s hands were unbound and a large backpack was placed on her shoulders.&nbsp; Then the hands were rebound in front of her.

Hal pulled a second backpack out of his trunk and slung it over his shoulders.&nbsp; Janice watched with a furrowed brow, trying to figure out what was going on.&nbsp; The two turned back toward the hunt area and started walking.

Once they got out of the ranch yard, they stopped.&nbsp; Hal fished around in Emily&#8217;s pack and pulled out a strange device.&nbsp; He placed headphones over his ears and aimed a dish-shaped object off in the distance.&nbsp; Janice&#8217;s blood ran cold.&nbsp; Ohmigod, she thought.&nbsp; They have sensors.

The worst part was that she had no idea what the sensors were capable of.&nbsp; Could they hear her?&nbsp; Could they detect her body heat?&nbsp; Could they smell her?&nbsp; She would not be able to follow as closely from now on.&nbsp; She knew that.

She felt stupid.&nbsp; It had never occurred to her that Hal would cheat like this.&nbsp; During the club hunts, the hunters were allowed to carry their guns and water and rope to bind their captives, but nothing else.&nbsp; Janice had assumed that they would play by the same rules today.&nbsp; But, as she thought back on the agreement that she had signed, she realized that there were no specifications about what a hunter could use.&nbsp; The only constraints were time and the fact that she was not allowed to go beyond the boundaries of the ranch.

As the hunting party moved, it would frequently stop and Hal would do a 360 degree turn with his arm and dish extended, obviously scanning and looking for Janice.&nbsp; Occasionally, he would exchange devices but he kept stopping and scanning.&nbsp; He had binoculars too, which he used to peer off into the distance.

Hal had obviously sensed something because he started walking toward Janice.&nbsp; She ducked into the underbrush and tried to hide.&nbsp; Her heart was pounding and she tried to calm herself.&nbsp; Charity was able to deal with this.&nbsp; She should be able to also.

He was walking straight toward her.&nbsp; She knew that she had been discovered.&nbsp; When he got about a hundred yards from her, she stood up and started running.&nbsp; He just kept walking.&nbsp; She ran out of breath and stopped, looking over her shoulder.&nbsp; He was still walking.&nbsp; She ran and hid and ran again.&nbsp; He continued to walk, moving toward her constantly.

It was four fifty in the afternoon when the blue dot exploded between her shoulders.&nbsp; She had almost made it.&nbsp; In another ten minutes, she would have won and would have been free.

At five fifteen, Charity received an email.&nbsp; It said simply, &#8220;Your mistress will be occupied for the next week.&nbsp; Clear your calendar for the following week.&nbsp; You will be similarly occupied.&#8221;

Attached was a picture.&nbsp; Hal had strung up his prize.&nbsp; Janice dangled from her wrists with her feet several inches above the ground.&nbsp; Her body was still painted with the mud that she used for camouflage and she still wore her loincloth and makeshift bra.&nbsp; The brightly colored feathers were also still braided into her hair.&nbsp; Charity thought she looked beautiful.

Charity quickly forwarded the email to Jill and then called her.&nbsp; &#8220;Oh my gosh, he got her!&nbsp; I just sent you the email I received.&#8221;

Jill went to her computer and opened the email and photo.&nbsp; &#8220;Wow!&#8221; she exclaimed.&nbsp; &#8220;She sure went native!&nbsp; She&#8217;s beautiful!&#8221;


Chapter 17

Hal was pleased with the outcome of the hunt, although he knew how it would end before it even started.&nbsp; He had invested a fortune in the high tech equipment and felt as if he were now better equipped than the CIA.&nbsp; He had been surprised that Janice had been able to evade him for so long, though.

The chase at the end had been exciting.&nbsp; He owed a great deal of his success to the Incunu.&nbsp; With them, he had learned three important rules about hunting.&nbsp; Be stealthy.&nbsp; Be calm.&nbsp; Be patient.&nbsp; With all of his electronic gadgetry and the fact that his prey was unarmed, he did not have to worry about being stealthy.&nbsp; But he was very calm and very patient.&nbsp; He slowly stalked her and bagged her.

He had tried to act magnanimous when he offered the terms of the deal to Janice.&nbsp; She would get Jill for two whole days.&nbsp; He would possibly not get Janice at all in return.&nbsp; Only the luck of the hunt would determine whether or not Janice would serve him.

But there was to be no luck involved.&nbsp; Hal was determined to capture the beautiful mistress.&nbsp; Someday soon, she would belong to him.&nbsp; And her beautiful, nubile slavegirl would also become a permanent part of his growing harem.

Hal drove to Jill&#8217;s house immediately after loading Janice into the car.&nbsp; He had to deposit Emily somewhere for the next week.&nbsp; He did not want any witnesses to his time with Janice.&nbsp; Jill&#8217;s place seemed like the logical choice.&nbsp; After all, Jill had owned her before he did.&nbsp; Charity was already at Jill&#8217;s when Hal arrived.&nbsp; He left Janice in the car as he led Emily, who was now wearing a blue sundress, to the front door.

They exchanged their pleasantries at the door.&nbsp; Hal declined the offer to come in, saying that he had pressing business to attend to.&nbsp; He left Emily with Jill, but not before taking the opportunity to taunt Charity.

&#8220;Get lots of sleep this week, slavegirl,&#8221; he said to her.&nbsp; Charity was dressed for once.&nbsp; She was wearing cut-off jeans and a polo shirt and looked adorable with her blonde hair pulled back in a ponytail.&nbsp; &#8220;I have lots planned for you when I collect you in a week.&nbsp; You will be very busy.&#8221;

Jill had already decided to let Charity stay with her for the week.&nbsp; Jill was going to claim Emily again as her katahua.&nbsp; Charity could become her husband&#8217;s katahua.&nbsp; She suspected that Bill would not mind his new role as chief.&nbsp; And she suspected that he would love having three females to serve him and meet his every need.

Hal had time to think through his plan again as he drove home.&nbsp; Janice was bound securely and gagged, so he had no worries about being distracted.&nbsp; His goal was to break her during the week that he owned her.&nbsp; Once he did that, Charity would belong to him also.&nbsp; And if he failed to break her, although he could not conceive of failing, he would still have the following week to break Charity.&nbsp; He believed that if he was able to get either one of them to permanently submit to him, he would get both.


He had envisioned several phases as he planned out the enslavement.&nbsp; The first phase was to be romantic.&nbsp; He would be charming and kind and would woo her.&nbsp; There was a chance that this would be enough to cause her to agree to become permanently his.&nbsp; It was a long shot, but he planned on wooing her at first.

There were three more phases to his plan: pain, humiliation and threat.&nbsp; He had no idea what the best order was for those three, though.&nbsp; Then, of course, there was always phase five in which he would have Charity in his clutches and would be able to play with her delectable body until she broke.

When they arrived at his home, Janice was treated like a queen; a naked and bound queen but a queen nevertheless.&nbsp; She would spend most of the week with her wrists bound behind her.&nbsp; He had grown fond of that look during his time with the Incunu.

He carefully removed the tiny garments that she had fashioned for herself during the hunt.&nbsp; He admired her body but would inspect her more properly after she had washed the mud off.&nbsp; He decided to let her keep her feathers for now and then led her to the bathroom.

For some reason, Janice was not embarrassed to be naked in front of Hal.&nbsp; After all, she reasoned, he had seen her naked before.&nbsp; Once was just this morning at the beginning of the hunt when she stripped by the cars.&nbsp; The day that she had been sold for the charity auction, she was also naked and was sure he had seen her then.

Hal ran the shower first and used a washcloth to gently scrub all of the mud off of her.&nbsp; Once the water was clear, he filled the tub and helped her to sit in the warm bubbly water.&nbsp; Then he lovingly shampooed her hair and washed her body.

&#8220;See?&#8221; he said as his fingers worked the suds into her raven mane, &#8220;being captive isn&#8217;t so bad after all.&nbsp; Is it?&#8221;

&#8220;I think that Charity would agree with that,&#8221; Janice replied.&nbsp; &#8220;She seems to enjoy being my slavegirl.&#8221;

Hal rinsed out her hair and then picked up a fresh washcloth, soaping it and then running it over his slave&#8217;s body.&nbsp; &#8220;There must be at least a little bit of slave in you,&#8221; he said.&nbsp; &#8220;Otherwise, you wouldn&#8217;t have let yourself get captured.&#8221;

&#8220;I did not let myself get captured,&#8221; she responded.&nbsp; She had to bite her lip.&nbsp; She wanted to call him a cheater but did not want to anger him.&nbsp; &#8220;You won me.&nbsp; I will not say that it was fair and square.&nbsp; But you won me.&#8221;

&#8220;Not fair and square?&#8221; Hal asked with mock indignation.&nbsp; &#8220;What rule did I violate in the agreement?&#8221;

Janice again had to bite her lip.&nbsp; She could kick herself for assuming that they would be using the normal hunt rules.&nbsp; That was her fault.&nbsp; She knew that Hal was sneaky by nature.&nbsp; She should not have been so trusting.&nbsp; &#8220;Look.&nbsp; You won me.&nbsp; Let&#8217;s leave it at that.&#8221;

Hal lifted one of the milky white breasts in his hand and leaned forward, kissing the firm, soft flesh.&nbsp; &#8220;Yes.&nbsp; And what a precious thing I have won.&nbsp; I will truly enjoy claiming my prize.&#8221;

He finished her bath and then dried her.&nbsp; He blow-dried her hair, letting her mane become full and wild looking which was not a normal look for her at all.&nbsp; Her hair had always been carefully coiffed when he had seen her in the past.&nbsp; But the new look fit well with the colorful feathers that she had woven into her hair.&nbsp; Plus, Hal needed to remove her from her normal life as much as possible.&nbsp; This was a small change, but it was a change.

He intended to feed her but that would have to wait for later in the evening.&nbsp; His first task would be to formally claim his prize.

Hal led the naked girl to his bed and had her sit on the edge.&nbsp; Then he pushed her back and let her adjust her bound arms beneath her to get comfortable.&nbsp; He took his time disrobing so that she would have time to think about what was about to happen.

He stepped between her legs and rubbed the tip of his cock through her petals, finding them already quite wet.&nbsp; He had previously noticed that slavegirls were always well lubricated after they were captured during the hunts.&nbsp; Now he knew that mistresses got that way too.&nbsp; It must be something about the excitement and the adrenalin that got them aroused.

He slowly sank his shaft into the slick tunnel, letting out a moan as it enveloped him and squeezed him.&nbsp; He started a slow in and out motion and leaned forward, kissing Janice.&nbsp; She did not resist but she did not eagerly return the kiss either.&nbsp; She knew that this was not lovemaking..&nbsp; She knew that it was just a male marking his property rights over a female.&nbsp; And he knew that she knew exactly what their coupling was all about.

His hands played with her glorious breasts as he continued to kiss her.&nbsp; His cock continued to slowly saw in and out of her captive body.&nbsp; She felt good to him and he knew that he was going to enjoy his ownership of her body.&nbsp; He climaxed and spurt his seed into her.&nbsp; There was no attempt to let her achieve orgasm.&nbsp; He would do that later.&nbsp; For now, he was simply marking her as his.


Chapter 18

Hal was a perfect gentleman on Sunday; as much as one can be when one owns a beautiful, naked slavegirl.&nbsp; He cooked for Janice and fed her.&nbsp; He bathed her.&nbsp; He fucked her often and made sure that she achieved an orgasm each time.&nbsp; He cuddled with her and let her rest throughout much of the day.

Monday started off much the same but started to change by mid afternoon.&nbsp; He asked her if she was enjoying herself and she replied that it was much nicer than she had expected.&nbsp; He told her that it could be like this always for her if she would become his.&nbsp; He even showed her an ownership agreement that he had prepared to make it official.&nbsp; She politely declined the offer without even reading it, not knowing that things were about to change.&nbsp; Hal was moving on to the next phase in his conquest of Janice.&nbsp; It was to be humiliation next.

Hal led his slavegirl down to the basement where he bent her over a bench.&nbsp; Then he prepared a batch of soapy water and produced a rubber tube.&nbsp; He was not in the habit of giving enemas so he had to improvise with what he had.&nbsp; As soon as Janice figured out what was about to happen to her, she started protesting.&nbsp; Struggling would have been useless with the way she was bound.&nbsp; Her legs were spread widely and anchored to rings in the floor.&nbsp; Her head rested on the bench, although her torso was off of it.&nbsp; Her arms were stretched out along the surface of the bench and strapped down securely.

&#8220;No, Hal,&#8221; she complained.&nbsp; &#8220;Please, not that.&nbsp; That&#8217;s going too far.&#8221;

Hal swatted one of her bottom cheeks, enjoying the slapping sound that it made and seeing how firm her butt was.&nbsp; &#8220;We&#8217;re just going to clean you out a bit.&#8221;

&#8220;Please no,&#8221; she pleaded.&nbsp; &#8220;It&#8217;s too much.&#8221;

He ignored her begging and completed his preparations.&nbsp; He hung the bucket high above her head and then greased her ass.&nbsp; He unceremoniously pushed the end of the tube into her butt, causing her to squeal and thrash in her bindings as her bottom was violated.&nbsp; She had never been used this way before.

Hal had to hold the tube in place since it was not equipped with a plug.&nbsp; But he enjoyed the sight before his eyes and did not mind the inconvenience.&nbsp; The naked, wiggling body was delightful to watch.&nbsp; Occasionally, he would swat a dancing bottom cheek or bend over to watch her full breasts swaying beneath her as she struggled.

The water continued to flow.&nbsp; He reached beneath her and felt her belly becoming fuller and tighter.&nbsp; When she cried out as the cramps started, he massaged her belly to try to sooth the cramping.

When he was satisfied that she was full enough, he quickly withdrew the hose and replaced it with a butt plug.&nbsp; The shape of this plug would keep it in place until he decided to let her void.&nbsp; In the meantime, he enjoyed himself by playing with the luscious breasts, swatting them back and forth and tugging on their nipples.

Finally, he decided to let her empty.&nbsp; He released her arms and secured them behind her back.&nbsp; Then he released her legs and led her to the toilet.&nbsp; He pulled out the plug and pushed her down onto the toilet and then waited.

&#8220;Can I have some privacy?&#8221; she asked.

&#8220;No,&#8221; was his simple response.&nbsp; She held it as long as she could but, with all of the cramping, that was not long.&nbsp; She loudly expelled all of the fluid, blushing furiously as she did so.&nbsp; She had never felt so humiliated in all her life.

Hal wiped her clean and then helped her to stand.&nbsp; &#8220;Again,&#8221; he announced.

&#8220;No, please!&#8221; she begged.&nbsp; &#8220;No more, please!&nbsp; That was horrible!&#8221;&nbsp; She struggled against him but without the use of her arms, it was futile.&nbsp; In short order, she was strapped back in the same position.&nbsp; Hal mixed up another batch of the warm soapy fluid, increasing the amount of water this time.&nbsp; Then he plugged the tube in and the water started flowing again.

Janice groaned as she felt herself filling up again.&nbsp; The cramping started anew and she struggled against her bindings.&nbsp; Hal alternately slapped a bottom cheek and then a breast, enjoying the sound of his palm against the soft flesh.&nbsp; When she started cramping, he started massaging the expanding belly with one hand while the other continued spanking the girl.&nbsp; When the bucket was almost empty, he crouched down to inspect his work.&nbsp; He was very pleased with the results.&nbsp; Janice looked like she was five or six months pregnant and he knew that she must be very uncomfortable with her belly so distended.

The routine was the same as he took her to the toilet.&nbsp; After she had expelled the fluid, he cleaned her and then announced, &#8220;Again.&#8221;

Janice shrieked and struggled to get away from his grip but she was no match for a stronger male who had the use of both arms.&nbsp; He quickly bound her back in the familiar position and prepared the third enema.&nbsp; This one was with cold water.

Janice started shrieking as soon as the icy water started flowing into her bowels.&nbsp; The cramping started almost immediately.&nbsp; After only a few minutes, her body felt chilled and her teeth started chattering.&nbsp; She continued to shriek and pull on her bindings.

Hal did not think of himself as a sadist but he had to admit that the sights and sounds of a beautiful woman in distress were appealing.&nbsp; He watched her ass dance in front of him and loved the poetry of its movement.&nbsp; He had learned that he could use only one hand to add to her torment.&nbsp; He had almost accidentally let the hose pop out earlier when he used both hands to toy with her body.&nbsp; That would have resulted in a mess.

This bucket contained even more water.&nbsp; Janice definitely had the look of advanced stages of pregnancy and there was still more water left.&nbsp; He decided to let the water flow a little longer.&nbsp; Her hands clenched and unclenched and her shrieks had died down to whimpers and incoherent babblings.&nbsp; Hal finally stopped the flow and dragged her to the toilet.

She had a dazed look on her face as he wiped her clean.&nbsp; He dragged her back to the table and she did not even struggle again.&nbsp; Instead, she just sobbed and mewled and begged that he not do it again.

Hal had no intention of another enema, however.&nbsp; He had a better use for her ass now.&nbsp; Once he had her secured to the bench again, he dipped two fingers back into the jar of lubricant and smeared it around her asshole.&nbsp; Then he pushed the fingers past the tight little pucker, rotating his hand to smear the jelly around.&nbsp; Janice groaned at the intrusion but the fight was out of her for the moment.

Hal lowered his pants and freed his cock.&nbsp; He knew from previous conversations with Janice that she had never done anal sex before.&nbsp; He was going to pop her cherry.&nbsp; He knew that this would weaken her resolve even further.&nbsp; At least it always did with Jill.&nbsp; Whenever Jill was acting up or resisting, he would take her anally.&nbsp; That would quickly eliminate her high-and-mighty attitude and make her docile and compliant.

He positioned his cock at Janice&#8217;s little rosebud.&nbsp; As soon as she realized what was about to happen, she started screaming and begging and thrashing about in her bindings again.&nbsp; She moved her hips back and forth, trying to invade the spear that was about to stab her.&nbsp; But with the tight bindings, it was easy for Hal to hold her ass in place.&nbsp; He gripped her hips and pushed forward, easing the tip of his cock into the forbidden channel.&nbsp; Janice groaned as she felt her bottom being stretched and then howled as he plunged fully into her.

She thought that she was being split in two and she was certain that he must have torn her sphincter.&nbsp; The pain was intense.&nbsp; But it was only momentary pain.&nbsp; Eventually, her ass adjusted to the intrusion and she was able to breathe normally again.&nbsp; Hal looked down and watched as his hard member disappeared into the shapely ass, only to reappear as he pulled back out.&nbsp; He had never tried fucking a cold ass before and made a mental note to do more ice cold enemas in the future.&nbsp; He did not last long.&nbsp; Her ass was tight and gripped his cock like a vise.&nbsp; He unloaded his seed into her bowels and then pulled out.

He pulled his pants back up and left her secured to the bench.&nbsp; He went upstairs, turning the lights off and leaving her to whimper alone in the darkness.

He returned two more times that day to rape her ass.&nbsp; That night, he brought her a bowl of fruit and put her in a cage for the night along with the bowl of food and a bowl of water.&nbsp; He knew that she would spend a miserable night alone in the darkness.


Chapter 19

He had Tuesday&#8217;s activities all planned out.&nbsp; Before he started with the day&#8217;s activities, however, he put the romantic act on again.&nbsp; He bathed Janice lovingly and fed her.&nbsp; When she accused him of brutally raping her, he calmly explained that he was only trying to help her by expanding her horizons.&nbsp; &#8220;How can you know whether or not you like something until you try it?&#8221;&nbsp; When he offered her the contract to sign again, she pushed it away without even reading it.&nbsp; That&#8217;s when she received her collar.

She sometimes collared Charity, more for Charity&#8217;s benefit than her own.&nbsp; Charity thought that it was exciting and erotic to wear a mistress&#8217; collar.&nbsp; Janice preferred the elegant, slender neck completely unadorned.&nbsp; But she did collar her girl occasionally.&nbsp; It was a beautifully tooled, ornate gold band that could be locked around Charity&#8217;s neck.&nbsp; The collar that Janice received was just the opposite.&nbsp; It was simply a black leather band with rings sewn into it for attachment points.&nbsp; It was a dog collar.

Hal took Janice out to his car and stuffed her into the trunk.&nbsp; When he opened it again, she found that she was back at the ranch.&nbsp; &#8220;We&#8217;re going to have another hunt,&#8221; explained Hal.

Shortly after arriving, a truck pulled up.&nbsp; Janice recognized the driver and immediately started pleading.&nbsp; The driver was another dominant from the club.&nbsp; He was not a cruel dominant but he was the one who provided the dogs that fucked the girls as evening entertainment.&nbsp; And four of his dogs were in cages in the bed of the truck.

Janice begged for mercy but it fell on deaf ears.&nbsp; They already had their plans laid.&nbsp; Sam asked Hal if he could use the new girl before they turned the dogs loose on her and Hal agreed.&nbsp; Janice was bent over a picnic table and fucked from behind by someone she had thought of as a friend before this.

After planting his sperm inside of the beautiful dominant-turned-slave, Sam brought his dogs over to her.&nbsp; She was mortified as they sniffed her crotch and they jumped and yelped in joy at having such a tasty morsel.

&#8220;We&#8217;ll give you fifteen minutes,&#8221; said Hal.&nbsp; &#8220;And then we turn the dogs loose.&#8221;

&#8220;Please, Hal,&#8221; begged Janice.&nbsp; &#8220;Please have mercy.&#8221;

&#8220;It&#8217;s Master from now on,&#8221; corrected Hal.

&#8220;Please, Master,&#8221; begged Janice again.&nbsp; But the begging was useless.&nbsp; She hung her head dejectedly and sobbed.

&#8220;The clock&#8217;s ticking,&#8221; said Hal as he tapped his watch.&nbsp; &#8220;You can let them have you here, though, if you&#8217;d like.&#8221;&nbsp; Janice started running.

Sam called out to her as she headed toward the fields.&nbsp; &#8220;Don&#8217;t put up too much of fight once they catch you.&nbsp; They can be pretty mean if they&#8217;re provoked.&#8221;

Janice kept running.&nbsp; But she was no match for the noses and speed of the dogs.&nbsp; Within twenty minutes of leaving the ranch yard, they were upon her.

It was obvious that the dogs had done this before.&nbsp; They worked as a finely choreographed team.&nbsp; One dog rushed at Janice from the side, knocking her off her feet.&nbsp; When she scrambled to her hands and knees to try to get up, a second dog clamped his teeth into her neck.&nbsp; He was not biting her.&nbsp; But the presence of the teeth pressed against her flesh and the low growl was enough to still her.&nbsp; A third dog quickly mounted her from behind and she groaned as the dog&#8217;s thick cock sank into her.&nbsp; A second dog was just finishing with her when the two men walked up.

&#8220;I just love hunting,&#8221; said Hal as he strolled up to the spot where Janice was being raped.&nbsp; &#8220;I&#8217;ve never done it with dogs before, though.&#8221;

&#8220;They are amazing animals if you care for them and train them well,&#8221; said Sam.

&#8220;Yes they are,&#8221; agreed Hal. &#8220;The same can be said of a fine slavegirl.&nbsp; This one should be well trained by the end of the week.&#8221;

Sam watched as the third dog took his position on Janice and saw the canine cock slide into the kneeling girl.&nbsp; Janice&#8217;s face was crimson with embarrassment at the treatment she was receiving.&nbsp; &#8220;Yes, she&#8217;s coming along nicely.&nbsp; Do you plan to keep her?&#8221;

&#8220;That&#8217;s the plan,&#8221; responded Hal.&nbsp; &#8220;She&#8217;ll be a nice addition to my collection.&#8221;

&#8220;How many do you have now?&#8221; asked Sam.

&#8220;Two females and a male,&#8221; answered Hal.&nbsp; &#8220;This one would make four.&nbsp; And her girl would be the fifth.&#8221;

&#8220;That&#8217;s quite a handful.&nbsp; Let me know if you ever need any help in training them.&#8221;

Janice could not believe her ears.&nbsp; She knew that Hal wanted to own her.&nbsp; He had made that clear ever since they met.&nbsp; But she never expected that he would admit it to anyone else.&nbsp; Now that he had, she hoped that his ego would not prevent him from releasing her.&nbsp; He might end up losing face now if he let her go.

The men watched as the third dog finished and the fourth mounted the girl.&nbsp; Janice had watched others with the dogs and couldn&#8217;t imagine that anyone would enjoy watching it.&nbsp; She certainly didn&#8217;t.&nbsp; She thought it was sick.&nbsp; And now that she was on the receiving end, she knew exactly how sick it really was.&nbsp; Nobody could enjoy this.&nbsp; They must do it just to humiliate a girl and knock her down a peg.

The rape finally ended.&nbsp; Hal clipped a leash back onto Janice&#8217;s collar and bound her hands behind her back once again.&nbsp; She was hosed down once they got to the barn and then stuffed back into the trunk of the car.

Wednesday found her back at the ranch with the same four dogs.&nbsp; Once again, she was captured by the pack and raped.&nbsp; She was hosed down and stuffed back in the trunk again.&nbsp; This time, Hal had another surprise for her on the way home.

It was mid afternoon when the car pulled to a stop.&nbsp; Hal opened the trunk and helped a naked Janice out into the sunlight.&nbsp; Janice gasped when she saw where she was.&nbsp; The sign over the shop read &#8220;Sal&#8217;s Tattoo and Piercing Parlor.&#8221;

&#8220;Oh, Hal, you can&#8217;t mean it,&#8221; she said with a tone of severe disappointment in her voice.&nbsp; When she had made the original deal with him to borrow Jill, she had actually been excited.&nbsp; She had never been hunted before and she even thought it would be fun to try it.&nbsp; She assumed that she could win that contest but, even if she didn&#8217;t, she thought it would be thrilling to act like a slave for a week.&nbsp; It would be like a vacation from reality.&nbsp; She had verbally sparred with Hal about his wanting to own her but it had always been light-hearted.&nbsp; Things had turned dark, though, all of a sudden; very dark.&nbsp; He seemed to be doing everything in his power to break her.&nbsp; She was very disappointed in him.

Even after he had cheated in the hunt, she had still been hopeful and was looking forward to an exciting week.&nbsp; She had been completely giving of herself during the first two days of captivity.&nbsp; She enthusiastically and energetically made love with him and was enjoying bringing him pleasure.&nbsp; Since that time, however, things had rapidly deteriorated.&nbsp; She had been humiliated with the awful enemas, raped anally, and raped repeatedly by dogs.&nbsp; Now it appeared that she was going to be maimed.

She tried to reason with him but he had his mind set.&nbsp; He marched her naked into the shop and handed her over to the proprietor.&nbsp; &#8220;The ones I picked out,&#8221; he told Sal.&nbsp; &#8220;Just the nipples this time.&#8217;

Sal turned out to be a greasy looking fat male of some sort of Mediterranean descent; Italian, she assumed.&nbsp; He put his hand on her shoulder and guided her toward what looked like a cross between a barber chair and an ob/gyn table.&nbsp; Her feet were secured into the stirrups before her wrists were unbound.&nbsp; Then, her arms were strapped to the arms of the chair.&nbsp; A leather band crossed her chest just above the breasts.&nbsp; Another one secured her to the chair at her waist.&nbsp; She was completely immobilized.

&#8220;Payment as we agreed?&#8221; asked Sal with a hopeful expression on his face.

&#8220;Of course,&#8221; replied Hal.&nbsp; &#8220;I&#8217;m an honorable man.&#8221;&nbsp; Janice wanted to scream at that statement.&nbsp; He was proving to be anything but honorable.&nbsp; She did not know what the payment agreement was but she figured it out soon enough.&nbsp; Sal dropped his pants and plugged her sex with his cock.&nbsp; It was obvious that she was paying for the pierced nipples with her own body.&nbsp; She was at least able to take some solace in the fact that, unbeknownst to Sal, his cock was swimming in dog sperm.&nbsp; He grunted a few times and then climaxed.&nbsp; At least he was fast, thought Janice.

The defacement of her body happened quickly.&nbsp; Sal placed special clamps on her breasts just behind the areolae which squeezed the tips of her breasts vertically.&nbsp; He took what looked like a leather punch and punched a hole in one nipple and then the other, inserting gold studs into each hole.&nbsp; She screamed as each hole was made.&nbsp; Once the studs were in, she whimpered as she looked down and saw the gold knobs on either side of her tender nipples.&nbsp; Her chest burned with pain as she was helped out of the chair.

&#8220;You sure have beautiful slaves, Hal,&#8221; said Sal.&nbsp; &#8220;Bring me all you got.&#8221;

Hal gave Janice another chance to sign the documents when they got home.&nbsp; She refused and things went even further downhill after that.


Chapter 20

The remainder of the week was a living hell.&nbsp; Hal had somehow convinced himself that his plan would work and, when it didn&#8217;t, he became furious.&nbsp; He abused Janice horribly.&nbsp; He also started drinking heavily.

The one bright spot of the drinking was that Hal passed out on Thursday night before he had a chance to lock Janice into her cage for the night.&nbsp; Janice took advantage of the opportunity to call Jill.

&#8220;Hide Charity,&#8221; she told Jill.&nbsp; &#8220;Get her as far away from here as you can.&#8221;&nbsp; Janice described what had happened so far and Jill was horrified.&nbsp; She knew that Hal could be slimy but he had never stooped this low.&nbsp; She promised to protect Janice&#8217;s precious slavegirl.

Thursday and Friday were a blur of pain for Janice.&nbsp; She was whipped multiple times and in every conceivable way.&nbsp; Her back and bottom and thighs felt the sting of the lash.&nbsp; Her breasts were whipped and her freshly pierced nipples caused her to howl in pain.&nbsp; Her sex was whipped, causing her to howl again.&nbsp; It wasn&#8217;t until he caned the souls of her feet that she screeched like a banshee, though.&nbsp; She had no idea that feet could be so abused but she had never felt such intense pain.

The cattle prod was also a constant companion, especially on Friday.&nbsp; All day Friday, he kept telling her that he was looking forward to using the cruel instrument on &#8220;sweet Charity.&#8221;&nbsp; He had a maniacal look in his eyes as he pressed the tip to her vulnerable flesh over and over again.&nbsp; And when he inserted the cruel wand into her sex and blasted her with it, she shrieked until she passed out.&nbsp; When she awoke, it was still in her sex and he was still grinning maniacally.&nbsp; She knew at that point that she would have broken if she had not already ensured Charity&#8217;s safety.&nbsp; But Charity was safe and that gave her the courage to endure.

The hot wax was almost like a vacation after the cattle prod and the whips.&nbsp; It hurt and it burned but it was nothing compared to the other pain that she had suffered.

Finally, Saturday morning arrived and Hal prepared Janice to return home.&nbsp; She would wear the little outfit that she created during the hunt a week earlier.&nbsp; Charity was to drive the car to Hal&#8217;s and deliver herself.&nbsp; Janice would take the car home and wait for Charity to be returned to her a week later.

Hal kept going to the window every time he heard a car but would return to the scantily clad and kneeling Janice each time after he realized that it was not Charity.&nbsp; Finally, Janice spoke up.

&#8220;She&#8217;s not coming.&#8221;

&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221; asked a stunned Hal.

&#8220;I have hidden her.&nbsp; She will not be coming.&#8221;

&#8220;You did WHAT!?!?!?!?&#8221; raged Hal.&nbsp; &#8220;She&#8217;s MINE!!!&#8221;

&#8220;She is not coming.&nbsp; I had her hidden.&nbsp; And if you ever come near her again, I will have you arrested if I don&#8217;t kill you first.&#8221;

Hal broke into a fit of rage.&nbsp; He picked up a lamp and smashed it to the floor.&nbsp; He grabbed a bookshelf and tore it off the wall, sending the contents scattering on the floor.&nbsp; Then he approached Janice and swung his arm, catching the side of her face with the back of his hand, making her see stars.&nbsp; She crumpled to the floor.&nbsp; He was furious.&nbsp; He kicked her in the ribs and then again in the stomach.&nbsp; Then he stopped.

&#8220;Oh my god!&#8221; he uttered.&nbsp; &#8220;What have I done?&#8221;

Janice slowly got to her feet.&nbsp; Hal&#8217;s blow had split her lip and she wiped the blood off with the back of her hand.&nbsp; She just glared at him silently.

Hal realized that he had lost it.&nbsp; He should have seen it earlier but he got sucked into the &#8216;game.&#8217;&nbsp; He had wanted to be with this woman forever.&nbsp; Now, he had driven her away.&nbsp; &#8220;I am so sorry,&#8221; he said.

&#8220;Stay away from Charity,&#8221; she said again, &#8220;or I will kill you.&#8221;

&#8220;I will.&nbsp; I will.&#8221;&nbsp; Hal gave Janice clothes to wear and then drove her home.&nbsp; He agreed to release Emily and Jill and her husband in exchange for Janice not pressing charges.

All of a sudden, Janice had four slaves.&nbsp; She adored Jill and her husband.&nbsp; She did not know Emily well but she seemed like a lovely girl, too.&nbsp; But she deeply loved Charity and she loved owning her niece.&nbsp; She did not want to risk that relationship by spreading her time over so many slaves.

The first thing that she did was to meet with Jill.&nbsp; Jill was kneeling at her new mistress&#8217; feet a week after the incident with Hal.&nbsp; &#8220;I&#8217;m giving you back your freedom, little one,&#8221; said Janice as she cradled Jill&#8217;s full breasts in her palms.&nbsp; She slowly worked the thumbs across the silky flesh and knew that she was missing an opportunity to enjoy this delightful creature.&nbsp; She also knew that Charity would miss having Jill as a playmate.&nbsp; &#8220;And your husband.&nbsp; The two of you were trapped by an evil man.&nbsp; You never should have been enslaved in the first place.&#8221;

&#8220;Really, Mistress?&#8221; asked Jill with tears in her eyes.

Janice leaned down and kissed Jill&#8217;s forehead as she gave each plump breast a loving squeeze.&nbsp; &#8220;Yes, really, dear.&nbsp; You are welcome to play, but you do it only when you want to from now on.&#8221;

Jill was overwhelmed.&nbsp; She moved closer to Janice and hugged her around the knees, placing her head in Janice&#8217;s lap and wept.&nbsp; &#8220;Thank you, Mistress.&#8221;

Janice combed her fingers through the red locks in her lap and admired the perfect nude before her.&nbsp; &#8220;You are welcome, love.&nbsp; It&#8217;s time for you and your husband to start enjoying your life together again.&#8221;

&#8220;Thank you, Mistress.&nbsp; But I can come back, can&#8217;t I?&#8221;

&#8220;Yes, pet.&nbsp; You may come back any time you want.&nbsp; But as a sub this time; not a slave.&#8221;

Emily was a tougher decision.&nbsp; Janice and Jill discussed her for a long time.&nbsp; Janice was surprised during the discussion though.&nbsp; She had released Jill and told her she was free but Jill made no attempt to get dressed.&nbsp; She just continued to kneel naked at her mistress&#8217; feet.

Jill told Janice about Emily&#8217;s past and how she had already turned down her freedom twice.&nbsp; Jill recommended that the girl be given the offer again.

&#8220;And what happens if she chooses to remain a slave?&#8221; asked Janice.&nbsp; &#8220;Will you own her?&#8221;

&#8220;Oh,&#8221; replied Jill.&nbsp; She thought long and hard before replying.&nbsp; &#8220;Could we co-own her?&#8221;

&#8220;You don&#8217;t want to own her completely?&#8221; asked Janice.

&#8220;I probably do, Mistress,&#8221; explained Jill.&nbsp; &#8220;But I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m ready for that yet.&#8221;

It was finally agreed that Emily would have two owners if she remained as a slave.&nbsp; Jill could assume full ownership at any point in the future that she decided.&nbsp; The two of them met with Emily and offered the girl her freedom.&nbsp; For the third time, Emily explained that she had no life to return to and she rejected the offer.&nbsp; She became the joint property of Janice and Jill.

Hal left the club.&nbsp; He realized that control over another human was like an intoxicant to him.&nbsp; And he was addicted to it.&nbsp; He began his recovery process which meant that he had to abstain from any participation in the lifestyle.

Jill had to make a tough decision.&nbsp; She either had to find another culture to study for her research or accept immersion.&nbsp; She explained it to one of her colleagues.&nbsp; &#8220;Once the toothpaste is out of the tube, you can&#8217;t put it back.&#8221;&nbsp; She had become part of their culture and their culture had become part of her.&nbsp; She could no longer be an outside observer with the Incunu.

She chose to continue with immersion research.&nbsp; She also increased the frequency of her visits.&nbsp; Now, she spent one month out of every three as Leopard Girl.&nbsp; The beautiful, naked huntress always took her katahua back to the island with her when she visited.&nbsp; The chief was delighted.&nbsp; Now he got to enjoy his Leopard Girl every third month and he truly loved exploring every inch of her lovely body.&nbsp; He also got to enjoy Leopard Girl&#8217;s energetic and enthusiastic katahua who made sure that his balls were constantly drained.&nbsp; Life was very good on the island.

The End

Chapter 1

Jill Wallings tugged the neck of her turtleneck up again as she prepared to start her lecture. The thirty one year old assistant professor did not usually wear something as casual as a turtleneck to class but she needed to hide the bruise on her neck and she couldn&#8217;t come up with any other reasonable way to do it.� She was, however, regretting her decision not to wear a jacket or sweater over it.� Even though it was too warm for either of those things, they would have at least concealed her body a little better.� As it was, every feminine curve was clearly on display.

The students most definitely did not mind her choice of clothing.� The boys all lusted after the beautiful professor.� The girls were a mixed bag.� Some envied her for her beauty and the effect she had on the boys.� The others lusted after her just like the boys.� Even some of the ones who considered themselves to be straight would have readily jumped at the chance to bed with her.

Regardless of whether they felt envy or desire, they all adored her.� She was everyone&#8217;s favorite teacher.� She was bright and lively.� She took a genuine interest in each of her students.� And she was always available to help them.

She started her lecture on the cultural history of south Pacific island tribes and every eye in the classroom was on her.� After about ten minutes of speaking, she noticed that nobody was taking notes.� Most of the students had their eyes roaming over her shapely body.� Quite a few were fixated on her large breasts.� And one girl was just gazing dreamily into her deep blue eyes.� She vowed that she would never wear anything so form-fitting in the future.

She managed to get through the hour and handed out the homework for the next class.� After the last student left, she disappeared into her attached office, closed and locked the door, and collapsed into her chair.� She groaned as she thought about her predicament.� Her personal life was a mess.

She was happily married and had been for the past five years.� That was not her problem.� She adored her loving husband.� But an indiscretion had turned her life and that of her husband upside down.

She thought back to the past weekend.� It had once again been humiliating.� While all of her friends had been having picnics or going sailing on the beautiful Saturday, she had been running naked through the woods with people chasing her.� And that was not the first time.� About once a month, she was hunted like that.

Jill was with a club on that day.� She was not a member of the club but her owner was.� The club members consisted of a group of wealthy dominant people, fairly evenly split between males and females, who liked to share their slaves and subs.� She and her husband had, unfortunately, become slaves due to her indiscretion.

She had not done anything bad.� At least in her mind it had not been bad.� As a professor, it was common for her to write grant proposals and she was very good at it.� In fact, she had won more grant money in the previous year than anyone else in the sociology department.� It all supported valuable research, like her current study of the south Pacific tribes.

She and her husband had bought a new house a couple of years earlier.� They were both doing well in their careers and decided to go a little more upscale; nothing extravagant, but something a little nicer than the little bungalow they had been living in.� They also anticipated starting a family soon and wanted more space to raise the children.

But when they were ready to close on the new home, their old home had still not sold.� They needed the money from the old home as a down payment for the new one.� And with both homes in their names, the mortgage company wouldn&#8217;t even loan on the new home because they thought that the couple would be over extended.

So Jill borrowed some of the grant money.� It was just a temporary arrangement.� They planned to finance the new home with a mortgage once the old one sold.� And then they would pay the money back.� Nobody would be harmed and the money would be used for what it was originally intended.

One of her coworkers discovered the missing three hundred thousand, though.� She remembered that discussion vividly.

�So good of you to come, Jill,� he had said as she entered his office.

�What is it, Professor?� Jill asked.� �I have a class in less than an hour and I have some things to prepare.�

�This won&#8217;t take long,� he replied.� �And I keep telling you that you should call me Hal.�

�Sorry, Hal,� she said.� �Just force of habit.�� Jill had earned her PhD at Gulf States University where they now both worked.� Hal Bascomb had been one of her professors and was her mentor while she was writing her dissertation.

Hal opened a folder on his desk and studied its contents for a moment.� Then he looked up at her.� �As the chair of this department, one of my responsibilities is the oversight of our grant monies.� There seem to be some irregularities with one of your grants.�

�Oh, I can explain that,� she said readily.� And then she laid out the events that led up to the loan and how she planned to pay it back.

�I see,� he said.� �But we have a problem.� Misuse of federal funds is a federal offense.�

Jill&#8217;s face blanched.� She never thought of what she did as a crime.� There was to be no harm done to anyone.� �Oh,� was all she said.

�And it is a very serious offense,� he continued.� �It is punishable by twenty years in prison.� And of course, expulsion from Gulf States would be automatic.�

�Oh god,� she muttered.

�But have no fear,� he smiled.� �Based on what you have told me, I&#8217;m sure that we can come up with a solution.� Now why don&#8217;t you run along to class while I think about this.� Come back later and we can get this all sorted out.�

After class, Jill called Hal&#8217;s secretary and scheduled an appointment with the chairman of the department.� It was near the end of the day when Jill returned to Hal&#8217;s office.

�Thanks for your understanding, Hal,� she said as she sat down in the chair facing his desk.� �Have you come up with anything?�

�I think so,� he replied as he looked at her.� This woman is remarkably beautiful, he thought.� And then he realized that he had that same thought every time he looked at her.� �The best way to handle it is to return the money.� Then we can create a document for the file, describing how it was temporarily used for some reason or other.�

�But I already told you that I intend to return the money.�

�Oh, but I mean return it now.� I had a chance to speak with an attorney this afternoon and he said that this was the only way to limit exposure.�

Jill sighed.� �I don&#8217;t have that kind of money, Hal.� I can&#8217;t do that until we finance the house.� And we can&#8217;t do that until we sell the old one.�

It was Hal&#8217;s turn to sigh.� �Yes.� Quite right.� You did tell me that earlier.� Most unfortunate.� But there is another way that was suggested by the attorney.� Read and sign this and I will make the deposit back into the account on you behalf.�

�Oh, Professor,� exclaimed Jill with a sigh of relief.� �I mean Hal.� That is very kind of you but that is too gracious of you.� I couldn&#8217;t ask you to do that.�

�My dear,� he said, �You may not have a choice.� It&#8217;s fortunate that I was doing my own checking of the grants yesterday because I learned this morning that the Feds have stepped up their audit programs and that a physics professor at another institution was indicted just last week for something very similar.�� This was all a fabrication but Hal knew that there would be no way for Jill to know that.

�So I&#8217;m afraid that either, I put the money in there myself or you go to prison and I have to find a new sociology professor.�� He pushed the document toward her and then sat back.� �So which will it be?�

�Okay, okay,� she said as she picked up the papers.� �Well thank you again for all of your kindness.�

�Not at all,� he smiled.� She started to read the document and a frown started to appear on her face, followed by a furrowed brow.� Then, all of a sudden, her jaw dropped.

�This is a joke, isn&#8217;t it?� she asked, bewildered.

�Not at all,� he said again.� �This is a legal contract to memorialize our arrangement.�

�But this would virtually make me you slave,� she said incredulously.

�There would be nothing virtual about it, my dear,� he replied.� �You would literally be my slave, as would your husband.�

�This is outrageous!� she protested.� �It&#8217;s preposterous!�

�It&#8217;s the only way,� he said, �unless you can come up with the money.�

�Surely there must be another way,� she said indignantly.� She was getting angry but was trying not to show her temper.

�Take it home.� Talk it over with your husband.� Perhaps the two of you can come up with a third alternative,� he said.� �I&#8217;ll give you until tomorrow morning to decide.� Oh, by the way, did I mention that the auditors are scheduled to be here tomorrow?�

Jill blanched for the second time that day.� She felt trapped.� By this time tomorrow, life as she knew it could be over.� She picked up the papers and excused herself.� She would have to come up with another way.


Chapter 2

She did not tell her husband about the contract at first.� She described her earlier conversation with Hal and told him about the audit scheduled for tomorrow.� And they wracked their brains together to find a solution.� But no ideas emerged that would remotely come close to fixing the problem.

In the end, she told her husband about the other alternative.� He just clutched the papers and stared at them as if he were in a state of shock.� Finally, he spoke.

�It&#8217;s better than losing you for twenty years,� he said.� He picked up a pen and signed the papers.� With tears flowing down her cheeks, Jill inked her name in the space below his.

The next morning, Jill was waiting for Hal at his office when he arrived.� �Did you come up with anything?� he asked.� She simply held out the document and he took it from her.� He flipped to the last page and nodded as he saw the two signatures.

�I guess not,� he continued.� �I really do think this is the best way.� It protects you.�

Somehow, Jill did not feel very protected at the moment.� She felt very vulnerable instead; and very humiliated.� She had foolishly placed her husband and herself into a situation which had cost them their freedom.� According to the terms of the contract, they would belong to Hal for the next five years.

�Please come in,� Hal said as he opened his office door and waited for Jill to enter.� Then he closed it behind him.� �Now, let&#8217;s see what I have purchased.� Do be a good dear and remove your clothes.�

�What!?!?!?!?� gasped Jill.

�Your clothing,� he repeated.� �Take it off so that I can see if I made a good deal.�

Jill opened her mouth to protest but closed it again without uttering a word.� What did she expect?� The document was very clear on expectations and requirements.� Immediate obedience was demanded at all times.� No activities on the part of the owner were prohibited.� She was clearly a slave and he was clearly the master.� He could do with her what he chose.� Reluctantly, she reached up and slowly stripped.

�This is an excellent arrangement we have entered into,� remarked Hal once she had taken off the last of her clothes.� Jill was a remarkable beauty.� Long flowing red hair spilled luxuriously down her back and chest.� He reached out and tucked it all over her shoulders, revealing two large, ripe and beautiful breasts.� He had known that she was well endowed but these surpassed even his wildest hopes.� Her narrow waist and flared hips and nicely padded ass were visions of perfection. Her finely sculpted thighs and firmly muscled calves were magnificent.� And her face, which he had admired for years, was simply gorgeous as it blushed furiously.

He did not touch her other than when he reached out and tugged lightly on the little red tuft of hair over her Venus mound.� �Lose this by tonight.� Be at my home at seven.� You can leave your husband at home this time.�

Then he let her get dressed and go on about her day.� That night, he raped her.� Well, rape is probably not the right word but that&#8217;s how she thought about it.� In reality, one cannot be accused of rape when one is using one&#8217;s own property.� He did use her well and often that night.


Chapter 3

She stood up from her desk and walked over to the mirror.� She tugged the neck of her turtleneck down and ran a finger over the bruised spot on her neck.� It was getting better.� Maybe tomorrow she would be able to wear just a blouse.

She had gotten the bruise during the hunt.� Hal belonged to a group that enjoyed getting together with their subs and slaves.� The club met weekly and there was some kind of activity or entertainment at each meeting.� Jill was one of the favorites so she was frequently part of the entertainment.

About once a month, the group got together for the hunt.� In reality, this was more of a terrorizing mixer.� It was a way for the dominants to sample the charms of subs and slaves who belonged to others.

It was terrorizing to the subs and slaves because they were, quite literally, the hunted.� The event took place on a large ranch and the bottoms were stripped, but for sneakers, and then given a head start.� The bottoms would then disperse and try not to get shot.

The weapon was a paintball gun.� One time, they used tranquilizer guns but that was deemed to be too hazardous.� Now everyone had a paintball gun and each hunter had a unique color of paintballs.� The rules of the hunts were changed each time.� Sometimes a single hit would capture a slave.� Sometimes it took two hits with the hunter having the second hit bagging the slave.� One time, it took a single hit but that hit had to be somewhere on the torso.� That turned out to be a messy day as the slaves&#8217; arms and legs were coated with multiple colors of paint as the hunters kept missing the mark.

Two things were constant in the rules.� The first was that the hunter who bagged the slave got to keep and use the slave until the next morning.� The other constant was the way the slaves were treated based on the order in which they were bagged.� The first one bagged during the hunt always received the most humiliating or uncomfortable treatment and then it gradually got better as they progressed through the sequence until they got to the last �kill� of the day who got off easy.� The �treatment� always occurred at dinner time.� Everyone would eat and then they would be entertained through the torture or humiliation of the prey.

For her first few hunts, Jill was always the first one bagged.� She couldn&#8217;t figure out why she was always so unlucky until one of the other girls told her that it was because she was so beautiful.� �All of them want you.� You are very desirable,� the girl had said.� �They won&#8217;t even look at the rest of us most of the time until they know that they can&#8217;t get you.�� That surprised Jill because she thought that the girl was beautiful in her own right.

But as a result of being the first kill of the day several times, she had endured some truly awful ordeals.� One time, she was bound and then fucked by a German Shepherd.� Another time, her breasts were filled with dozens of sharp needles until they looked like pincushions.� Yet another time, she had been hung by her breasts and whipped.� Nowadays, she was wiser and much more cautious.� She never makes it to last, but she can usually end up in the middle by varying her pattern and concealment techniques.

She is told that she is still the favorite but a change in the rules has caused the hunters to not wait all day to bag a slave in hopes of getting her.� Now, if a slave is not captured during any sixty minute period, the hunt is called off.� The slaves refer to this as the �Jill Rule.�� At least now, she has a sporting chance.

Plus, there is another slave in the group who is nearly as popular as she is; maybe even more so.� A girl named Charity had been brought into the club by her owner this past spring.� At first, that had been uncomfortable for Jill because Charity had been one of her students the year before, but they quickly became best friends.

Last Saturday, Jill and Charity had stuck together during the hunt.� Usually, Jill liked to travel and evade alone.� It was safer for her that way.� But she always enjoyed spending time with her former student so they were a team that day.

�How high should we go?� asked Charity.� They were climbing up the rocky face of one of the cliffs, hoping to get to an overhang.� They figured that, once there, they could lie on the flat rock and not be visible from below.� The only way they would be caught was if someone climbed higher and happened to look right down on them.

�I think the second highest would be best,� replied Jill.

�Okay,� chirped Charity as she started to scramble up the rocks again.� Jill smiled as she watched her student&#8217;s lithe body move gracefully up the rugged terrain.� The girl had boundless energy and was breathtakingly beautiful.� It was a treat for Jill to watch the firm bottom and thighs tightening and flexing with each movement even though she thought of herself as devoutly heterosexual.

They reached the outcropping and checked it out for the best hiding spots.� They settled on a spot that would let them lie in the sun since the day was a cool one, but which would keep them pretty well hidden from above.� They lay together, facing each other, and rested their heads on each other&#8217;s arms.

�Thank you for being so beautiful,� said Charity, tilting her head forward and kissing her teacher on the lips.

�Look who&#8217;s talking,� laughed Jill.� �You are the beautiful one.�

�I&#8217;m pretty,� replied Charity.� �But you&#8217;re the beautiful one; inside and out.�� She planted another kiss on Jill&#8217;s lips and then lingered there.� There was nothing passionate about it.� It wasn&#8217;t even sexual.� It was just two sets of loving lips touching each other.

The day progressed and nobody found them.� They could hear guns going off below and heard a few cries from slaves that got hit.� Even though the paintballs were not lethal, they still stung when they hit someone, especially if that someone was naked.

Apparently one of the girls had climbed up onto the ridge above them.� They heard the sound of a paint gun and then the cry of the girl nearby.� The hunter climbed up the rocky face barely ten feet away from Jill and Charity but never spotted them.� He claimed his girl and fucked her on the spot for the next fifteen minutes.� Jill and Charity listened to the grunts and wet slapping sounds of the two as they went at it.� After the male filled his slavegirl with his seed, he led her off through a different, easier route back down to the ground.

�I&#8217;m horny,� announced Charity after they had left.� She moved her head down and started sucking on one of Jill&#8217;s nipples.� �Aren&#8217;t you horny?�

�No,� replied Jill.� �But if you keep that up, I will be.�

�Ooooo!� squealed Charity and then she started sucking harder and faster.� Even though she considered herself to be heterosexual, Jill had made love with plenty of other females since becoming a slave and Charity was always her favorite sex partner.� So the two of them took a break from the boredom of the day and made love in the sixty-nine position with Charity on top.

That&#8217;s when Charity got bagged.� Her bottom was sticking up enough to be barely seen by the hunter but she was wiggling it excitedly as Jill&#8217;s tongue drove her crazy.� It was that movement that caught the attention of the hunter.� With a well aimed shot, he was able to hit the bottom cheek squarely, spattering the green paint all over it as Charity was climaxing.

�Oh shit,� groaned Charity as she came back down from her orgasm.

�They were going to get you anyways,� consoled Jill.� It was true.� Sooner or later, all of the slaves got caught.

�Yeah, but it was bad timing.�

�Jill laughed and gave the beautiful pussy above her face another lick.� �At least you got to climax.�

It took several minutes for the hunter to reach the spot where the girls were.� That gave Charity enough time to give Jill her orgasm.� They were lying together when the male poked his head up next to the rock they were on.

�Oh, look what we have here,� he said.� �My two favorites.�

He bound Charity&#8217;s wrists behind her back and then told Jill to start running.� He was only allowed to bag one girl but he could still splatter her naked body with green paintballs that would hurt so Jill took off.� It was only a matter of time now, she knew, before she would get captured too.� She looked back at one point and saw the hunter spreading Charity&#8217;s thighs and then sinking his thick cock into the girl.� Jill had been captured by him during a previous hunt and she knew that Charity was in for a tough time.� He tended to be rougher than most.

Thankfully, Jill made it across the open field without getting spotted.� She found a good hiding place and hunkered down, trying to stay out of sight.� She actually lasted longer than she expected but thirty minutes after she settled in, she felt the pain burst in the side of her neck and knew that she had been bagged.� She reached up and touched the spot where the ball hit and then she held it before her face, seeing the pink paint.� She wondered which dominant was assigned pink today.

Charity&#8217;s Aunt Janice, who was also Charity&#8217;s owner, stepped into view.� �It&#8217;s my lucky day,� she said as she smiled.

�Yes, Mistress,� replied Jill.

�Come on,� said Janice.� �Let&#8217;s get you out of there and get you cleaned up.�� She bound Jill&#8217;s wrists behind her back, as was the custom, and then led her back to the ranch house.� It turned out to be an easy evening for her.

Charity was the fourth from last at being bagged so she just received a light whipping of her breasts during the entertainment after dinner.� Jill was second to last and only had to endure being tickled by a long feather.� Compared to the ones who had been captured early, they had it easy.

That evening, Janice mostly wanted to talk.� She asked questions about Hal and Jill answered them.� Jill knew that Hal was interested in enslaving both Janice and Charity and she assumed that her owner for the night was trying to figure out what it would be like.� They also talked about Charity for quite a bit.� It was obvious that Janice prized her little slave girl and loved her.� They did have sex but it was more like making love.� It was slow and tender.� And they slept curled up with one another.


Chapter 4

Jill realized that she had been sitting in her office by herself for over an hour as she thought back on her recent life.� But she had students who needed her help so she couldn&#8217;t stay locked inside her memories and regrets forever.� She got up from her desk and unlocked and opened the door to the hallway.� And then she had an almost steady stream of students visiting her.

At times, it was almost comical to her.� Some of the students had specific issues that they wanted to discuss or well formulated questions that they were seeking answers to.� Others, however, seemed to be there just to be there.� They would step into her office and stammer and sometimes blush.� They always looked at her face and sometimes their eyes would furtively glance at her chest.� She knew that she should be offended but she found it entertaining and comical.

Finally, the flow of students ended and she was able to get back to her research.� She was still reviewing and cataloguing her notes from a recent field expedition when Charity poked her head into the office.

�Hi, sis,� said Charity.� �How&#8217;s your neck?�

Jill would have rebuked any other student who called her sis.� She had earned the title of Professor through hard work and she preferred to be called that.� But Charity was different.� She really was like a sister.

Jill reached up and pulled the collar of the turtleneck away, showing Charity the spot where she had been shot.� �It&#8217;s almost faded,� she said.

�Yeah, it looks a lot better. Can you talk for a bit?�

�For you, always,� smiled Jill.� �What&#8217;s on your mind?�

�Not much, really,� said Charity as she plopped down into a chair.� �I just wanted to talk to you and see how Saturday went.�� They had not spoken since Jill had been chased off the ledge by the hunter who had bagged Charity.

�Saturday actually turned out to be a lot of fun,� replied Jill.� �I loved spending the day with you.� And you have a wonderful mistress.� I loved being able to get to know her.�

�Yeah, she loved owning you,� said Charity.� �She said you&#8217;re bright and fun and so, so sexy.� But I already knew that.�

Jill laughed at the comment.&nbsp; �Thanks.&nbsp; How did your time go?�

�Not as well as yours,� responded Charity.� �That guy sure�likes his pain.&nbsp; Actually, I think he really liked my pain.�

�Yes, I know,� offered Jill.� �He got me one time too.�

�I&#8217;ve never had a guy fist me before.� I never realized how much bigger their hands are.� But he managed to get it in.�

�Ouch,� said Jill.

�Exactly,� agreed Charity.

�So what&#8217;s on your mind, Char?� asked Jill, pronouncing Char as Chair.� �Or are you just here to let me see that cute little slave body of yours?�

Charity hemmed and hawed for a bit before responding.� �Well, there is something that I wanted to ask you.� I wanted to ask you on Saturday when we were together on the ledge but I never know how long we are going to have during those hunts before we&#8217;ll be shot.� And I didn&#8217;t want to distract you from what we had to do that day.�

Jill listened.� She was tempted to close her office door but that would look odd.� She always kept it open when she met with students.� �Yes?� she asked.

�Well,� Charity started, �how do you feel about being a slave?� I mean what goes through your mind on a day like Saturday?�

�Hmm,� replied Jill as she leaned back in her chair, thinking.� �Let&#8217;s start about how I feel about being a slave.� At first, I hated it.� I never grew up aspiring to be owned.� I became a slave through my own foolishness, which I would prefer not to get into.� At first, it was the worst thing imaginable.� And finally, I told myself that I could keep feeling miserable and sorry for myself or I could resign myself to what I am.� And that&#8217;s how I feel about being a slave.� I have resigned myself to it.� I accept the fact that my body does not belong to me.� I accept the fact that I must do as I am told.� And I accept the fact that I have no control over my private life.

Charity leaned forward, resting her arms on Jill&#8217;s desk as she listened.

�I feel quite differently about Saturday,� Jill continued.� �In fact, I feel differently about almost all of the group&#8217;s events.� I love them.�

�Really?� asked a surprised Charity.� �If you are only resigned to being a slave, I would have thought that things like Saturday would be a chore for you.�

�Well, what is a chore is when I am summoned at the end of a work day to serve that night;�or on a Saturday afternoon when I am in the middle of something.� I go, but it always feels like something is being yanked out of my heart.�

Jill went on.� �But for the scheduled events like Saturday, I have a chance to get prepared.� Even if I don&#8217;t know what the event will be about, I can get myself into the proper mindset.� I think like I am an actress who is getting ready to perform.� The adrenalin is rushing and I am just focused on myself and making sure that I give the best performance ever.�

�That way, even if the event is awful, I can focus inward and enjoy my role in it.� And every once in awhile, I get a pleasant surprise, like the first time you and I were paired together.� I remember you being strapped to the table and me being able to take my time devouring your precious body and making love to you.�

�Mmmm� cooed Charity.� �I liked that.� But we made love to each other as I remember it.�

Jill chuckled and got up from her chair.� �Maybe I should shut my door.�� She locked it and then returned to her chair.� �And I loved the time that you and I were bought together by that couple.� Being sold can be horrifying.� But I had prepared my mind to perform and then you were thrown into the mix.� I had a lot of fun at the event and during our week of captivity together.�

�Mmmmm,� cooed Charity again.� �Yes, I loved that too.� We didn&#8217;t get much of a chance to be together during the week, but I loved being near you.�

�So in answer to your question, finally,� Jill started up again.� �I loved Saturday.� I had a ball.� I knew that it was going to be a hunt and I knew that I would be shot.� So I was able to get myself into thinking of myself as prey.� And then you were thrown in on top of it and we got to make love again.� Plus, I was finally able to get to know your beautiful mistress.� I had the time of my life on Saturday.�

Charity smiled.� �I&#8217;m glad that you had fun.� I always love being with you.� You are always so beautiful and so proud.� But in a way, we are almost complete opposites in how we view slavery and the events.�

�Oh?� asked Jill.� �How so?�

�Hmmm.� Let me see.� Well, I love being a slave.� And I did grow up dreaming of being owned.� Well I didn&#8217;t dream of that my whole life.� But for the past few years, I have fantasized about it.� I even used to write stories about it because it was the only way to express myself as a slave until recently.�

�Yes, your mistress shared some of your stories with me,� interjected Jill.� �They are quite good.�

Charity blushed.� �Thank you.� I don&#8217;t write much any more, though, now that I get to experience it in real life.�

�That&#8217;s a shame,� Jill said.� �I would love to read the story that included last Saturday&#8217;s activities.�

�Maybe I&#8217;ll try one like that,� responded Charity.� �But there&#8217;s a difference between us about those events.� You just accept slavery and I love it.� You love the events and I dread them.�

�Oh, I&#8217;m sorry,� replied Jill.� �I had no idea.� Why do you dread them?�

�I&#8217;m not sure,� continued Charity.� �Maybe it&#8217;s because I feel like there&#8217;s such a big audience and I will fail them?� And maybe it&#8217;s because I will end up with someone like that jerk who bagged me on Saturday.� I always love being with you at the events but that has only happened three times.� And we never know if we will be able to be together until the event starts.� So I go into each one filled with dread and live in terror through most of them.�

�I&#8217;m so sorry, sweetie,� said Jill sympathetically.� �You certainly hide your feelings well.� I had no idea.�

�It&#8217;s okay.� I just have to get better.�

�Maybe you could try doing what I do.� Prepare your mind for what is coming.� Create a role.� Get ready to be thrilled.� And I&#8217;ll try to help by getting paired up with you more often.�

Charity smiled weakly.� �I&#8217;ll try it.� It&#8217;s better than going into them filled with dread.� Let me ask you something.� Do you think that Professor Bascomb would ever loan you to my mistress?� Maybe for a week or so?� Your husband could come too if you&#8217;d like.�

�Oh, love, I&#8217;m sure he would,� replied Jill.� �But be careful what you ask for.� He can be such a pig.� I&#8217;m sure there would be a very steep price for that.�

�Well, I&#8217;m sure that the price would be worth it,� said Charity.� �What do you think that he would demand for that?�

�You,� replied Jill.� �I&#8217;m sure he would want you in exchange.� He goes into every hunt with only you in mind.� He has been dying to lay his hands on you.� And I expect that he would demand your aunt also.� He keeps talking about what a beautiful slave your mistress would be.

�Oh,� said Charity.� �Well I wouldn&#8217;t mind being the price.� But I can&#8217;t risk Aunt Janice.�� The two of them chatted for a bit longer and then Charity left.� Jill had a departmental dinner meeting scheduled for seven o&#8217;clock so she decided to just stay in her office and work until then.


Chapter 5

Work evaded Jill as she sat in her office.� She kept thinking about sweet Charity and her loving mistress and the events of the past weekend that she and Charity had just talked about.� �It&#8217;s a wonder that I get any work done at all any more,� she thought to herself.� She was always either being a slave or thinking about it, it seemed.

She was able to get some of her research done though.� She had recently returned from a month long field research expedition.� In fact, she and Hal were presenting tonight based on that trip.� He had gone with her.

In fact, he had insisted that they go.� She did not want to.� Their research styles were complete opposites.� She was an observational sociologist.� She believed that one could only study a culture from a distance.� Any contact with the group being studied would interfere and change behaviors.� Therefore, you would be studying something artificial.

Hal called himself an immersion sociologist.� He said that you could only really understand a culture by becoming part of it.� She considered that schlock science and tended to totally discount what was published by these participatory scientists.� But Hal had insisted that they conduct this research together and that they do it his way.

He never said why he grew such a sudden interest in one of the tribes she had been studying but she knew exactly why.� She had published a paper on them six months ago based on the research she had done in the previous three years.� The paper, �The Sociological and Sexual Behaviors of the Incunu Tribe of Papaluana,� had brought her a few compliments from colleagues but there was nothing earth shattering about the work.� But Hal had taken an interest in it and Jill suspected why.� The culture of the tribe was very similar to that practiced by devotees of bondage and discipline.� It was a male dominant society which probably made it even more appealing to Professor Bascomb.

Jill had become quite proficient in the Incunu language during previous visits so she was sent ahead to make the arrangements.� She had taught Hal a few words so the he would not be at a total loss and she also typed up a little translational dictionary for him to study.

When Hal arrived two days after Jill did, she was already naked with her hands bound behind her back and a vine tied around her waist.� This acted as a leash.� The chief had been suspicious but amused by Jill&#8217;s request for immersion in the culture.� She had always wanted to maintain somewhat of a distance in the past.� After much discussion and haggling, the chief finally agreed.� His price was that the beautiful redheaded scientist would belong to him.� So she was kneeling at the chief&#8217;s feet without a stitch of clothing when Hal stepped off the boat.� The chief held her leash.

�Welcome to our island, teaching leader,� said the chief.� All dialogue was in the Incunu language but has been translated into English for the benefit of the reader.

�Thank you, great lizard,� replied Hal.� Jill gasped when she heard that.� It was obvious that Hal had not studied her dictionary very thoroughly.� She glanced up and saw the chief&#8217;s face tightened into a scowl with his hand on the hilt of his knife.� She knew she had to intervene.

�Please excuse the teaching leader, my savior,� Jill said to the chief.� �He meant no insult.� He is new to your language and needs to learn it.

Hal looked puzzled.� He had no idea that he had made an error until Jill informed him in English what he had just said.� He grew embarrassed and apologized.

�My sorry,� Hal said.� �I am but a palm tree with fish.�� Jill just rolled her eyes.� She had no idea what he was trying to say.� She just looked up at the chief and shrugged.� This was going to be a very long month.� The chief smiled back at her and shrugged his shoulders with her and then ruffled her red hair.� She washed it every night but combs had not yet been introduced into this culture so she did not use one.� After only two days without a comb, her hair was now a long, wild mane.

The group got through the introductions without further incident and then moved off of the beach.� Hal was shown to the hut that he would be using and he unpacked the few items that he brought on the trip.� Since this was immersion research, he would be wearing whatever the tribe wore.

After he settled in and made a few notes, he finally looked at the dictionary that Jill had created for him.� He should have done that earlier.� He had almost lost his life earlier because he had failed to study.� He was still studying when Jill arrived at his hut, escorted by two young males who were obviously her bodyguards.

�We should speak English now,� said Jill.� �But after this discussion, it should be strictly Incunu.� I see you are studying the dictionary.�

�Yes, just brushing up, really,� lied Hal.

�I see.� I must have had a few typos in that thing based on some of the things you said earlier.�

�It just takes a little getting used to,� Hal said.� �What&#8217;s up with the two henchmen?�

�They are my protectors,� she replied.

�What do you need protection from?� asked Hal.

�You, I think,� responded Jill.� �But the chief was not specific.�

�Hmmm� said a puzzled Hal.� �Why would you need protection from me?�

�Because I am the property of the chief,� she replied.� �That was the only deal I could strike.� He was not going to let us live with the tribe any other way.�

�I see,� nodded Hal.� �Do I get a girl too?�

�Yes.� He said that you will be given a girl after you pass the manhood initiation and then you can claim the girl of your choice other than any katahuas.� That&#8217;s what they call the main girl of each of the males.� And I&#8217;m a katahua.�

Hal nodded again as he listened.� He remembered from Jill&#8217;s article on the tribe that each adult male had a main girl.� This was sort of like the head slave or chief concubine.� She was not the male&#8217;s exclusive bedmate but was the principal one.� And she typically assisted when the male decided to bring a different girl to bed.� Main girls were rarely shared with others and it was typically for ceremonial purposes when they were.

Hal sighed.� It looked like he would not be able to play with his favorite sex toy for the next four weeks.� It was a shame because she looked so erotic right now and he could easily fuck her on the spot.� She stood proudly with her shoulders squared back.� Her large breasts thrust forward invitingly and her tangled mane added to her exotic look.� And her body glistened in the sunlight.� Tanning oil had been her one compromise on immersion.� She knew that she would probably be scantily attired for the month and that her fair skin would be ravaged by the intense tropical sun.� She had no idea that she would be kept completely naked though.� But she had brought plenty of oil with as much sun protection capability as possible.� Even with that, she could tell that she was darkening already after only two days on the island.

�What&#8217;s the initiation all about?�

�I don&#8217;t know the whole thing,� replied Jill.� �I just know that the last part requires that you stand on the point all night.�� She gestured toward a little spit of land that stuck out into the ocean near the beach.

�Oh, that doesn&#8217;t sound so bad,� he said.

�At high tide, the point becomes submerged.� And there are sharks in these waters.�

�Oh,� gasped Hal.� �Maybe this immersion wasn&#8217;t such a good idea after all.�

�I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ll survive,� responded Jill.

�Do they ever lose anyone?�

�Not often.�

�When is the initiation?�

�In about an hour.�

Hal gasped.� �Ohmigod!!!� I&#8217;m going to die!!!�� Normally, he put on an act of confidence and manliness.� Jill was surprised at how quickly that fa�ade crumbled.� She just hoped that he didn&#8217;t embarrass her.� In her mind, having him eaten by sharks was preferable to having him act like a coward.� She made some reassuring comments and tried to bolster his courage.� Then she left him to his thoughts and was once again flanked on each side by her protectors.

A naked Hal was paraded into the center of the village an hour later.� There he underwent a series of tests to prove his worthiness.� He had to demonstrate his courage, his strength, his virility, and that the gods looked down on him favorably.

His courage was tested when he ran the gauntlet.� The Incunu word for it translated as �woman maker� but it was essentially a gauntlet.� All of the males in the tribe formed two lines that faced one another.� They were all armed with clubs or poles or strips of leather.� The initiate had to run through the village between the two lines while the tribe members swung their weapons and beat him, grab the icon at the far end of the camp, and then return back between the attacking lines.

Jill learned why it was called a woman maker as the chief was giving Hal his instructions.� If he made it through the first test, he would be deemed worthy enough to move to the second test.� If he did not pass the first test, he would be relieved of his cock and balls.� Jill wondered how much of that Hal understood but was then thankful that he had not studied the language.� It was probably best that he not know that he could possibly be womanized.

But Hal did pass the first test.� He was badly bruised and battered but he returned to the chief triumphantly, holding the icon above his head.� They moved to the second test.

A rope was tied around Hal&#8217;s scrotum and the other end was tied around a large stone.� Hal&#8217;s test of strength was to stand up, which would lift the stone off the ground, and carry the stone to the chief using only his balls to support the heavy object.� Jill winced as she saw him get to his feet, seeing the weight of the rock stretching the scrotum painfully downward.

Jill was standing beside the chief but slipped behind him to use him as a shield to block her view of the painful sight.� But the chief pulled her in front of him and commanded her to watch.� He reached up and toyed with her delicious, full breasts as Hal inched his way painfully across the village center.� He eventually made it and was relieved when the rope was removed.

The next test involved a girl.� She got him hard with her mouth and then pumped his cock with her hand until his seed spurt in a long arc through the air.� He was deemed to be virile.

Finally, it was time to leave for the point.� Jill was left in the village as the chief took Hal and two protectors down to the beach.� Hal was sent to the tip of the point and was told that the chief would return for him in the morning.� The two protectors were not there to protect Hal, though.� They were there to protect the honor of the tribe.� If Hal tried to escape, they were to kill him.

Hal spent a miserable night.� The water was warm enough as it started rising but he knew about the sharks.� He was in a panic by the time the water reached his neck and was filled with fear each time something rubbed or bumped against his body.� But eventually, the tide started going out and the water level fell.� He was not eaten by sharks.� Apparently, the gods looked down on him favorably.

The final part of the ceremony took place in the morning.� He was given his first reward as a man of the tribe.� He was given one of the Katahuas for the day.� Hal led the beautiful Polynesian girl to his hut and fucked her despite his exhaustion.� He eventually passed out, using her as a mattress for much of the day, and then fucked her again when he woke up.� She led him back to the center of the village as it was getting dark.

There, he was treated as a brother by all of the males and was given his tribal clothing.� He received his breech cloth, which he thankfully tied around his waist.� It only covered his front, and barely at that, but it was something.� They gave him his gold arm band which he wore high on his left upper arm.� And he received his weapons. One was a large curved knife that was worn at the waist.� Another was a smaller knife, much like a dagger, strapped to his thigh.� The third was his bow and quiver of arrows.� He hoped that he would never need them.� The only time he had ever used a knife was to cut his steak.� And he had never used a bow before.

Jill actually found herself feeling proud of him.� Despite his frequent pomposity and overbearing nature, she was glad that he had performed so well.� Maybe the month wouldn&#8217;t be so long after all.


Chapter 6

Jill checked the clock on her desk.� It was only five thirty.� She still had a long wait until the dinner meeting.� Her thoughts went back to the island.

Hal quickly chose his own katahua out of the harem of one of the other males.� That was one of the things that amazed Jill in her earlier studies of the tribe.� They were very protective of the females.� All of the girls were associated with a male.� There was no such thing as a single woman here.� And, while they were fiercely possessive of their katahuas, they seemed to think of all of the others as merely temporarily held possessions.� Newly initiated males were free to pluck any of them out of any harem they chose.� Jill knew that Hal&#8217;s new main girl would probably be walking bowlegged the next day.� She had never known anyone as horny as him.

The days passed quickly.� Hal learned how to hunt and fish.� Jill learned how to weave and cook the native dishes.� They quickly blended into the tribe despite being the only white people on the island.

Nursing was a community activity and each of the adult females was available to any of the children.� Being naked made preparation for the task easier, but Jill found it an embarrassing job since she had no milk in her breasts.� It was also embarrassing because it was only the older children who selected her breasts.� Most of the women in the tribe were stunningly beautiful with large, firm breasts, but the teenagers chose hers.� It must be the novelty of having a white woman, she thought.� And she knew that they were probably having sexual thoughts as they suckled on her nipples.� She knew that she was certainly having sexual thoughts as a result of what they were doing to her.

During the second week of their research, a second male was initiated into manhood.� He endured all of the same ordeals that Hal had suffered through.� Then, on the morning after his vigil on the point, Jill was selected as the katahua who would complete the initiation by being the first woman he would ever fuck.

She was surprised that she had been chosen.� Surely one of the others would know the culture of the tribe better and would be better suited to be this boy&#8217;s sexual mentor.� But she was proud that she had been trusted enough for this sacred ceremony.� She took her job very seriously and, throughout the course of the day, coaxed every drop of semen out of him.� She looked bedraggled and disheveled as she brought him back to the center of the village at the end of the day.� He looked completely exhausted but was grinning from ear to ear.

It was during the third week of their stay that disaster struck.� Oceangoing canoes were spotted on the horizon.� Another tribe was coming to raid them.� The men grabbed their weapons and headed out in small bands to track the canoes and defend the island.� Since the only thing of value on the island was the women, the chief stayed in the village to defend them along with another one of the males.

Jill recommended that she be given a bow, a suggestion that greatly amused the chief.� There was no way that a female could possibly shoot a bow.� But Jill was insistent.� She knew how to use one and she argued that it was foolish not to use every weapon possible.� Still, she got nowhere with the chief.

Finally, she suggested that she be able to prove it to him.� If she was not good enough, then she would give back the bow and wait with the other women.� The chief finally relented.

Jill took a few practice shots to acclimate to the new weapon and then she took her first aim.� A coconut had been placed on the ground as a target and she easily sank her arrow into it.� Her second arrow also hit it squarely.� They moved the coconut much farther away and Jill sank three more arrows into it.� The chief watched in awe but finally agreed to let her fight.

The canoes divided into three groups as they got closer to the island.� Jill learned later that two of the groups that tried to outflank the village were repelled by the tribe.� The only one that successfully made it to shore was the one that was attacking the village frontally.� Six attackers stepped ashore.

Jill had been placed in the rear and she watched as the chief and the other male from the village defended it valiantly.� She saw one of the attackers go down but still they advanced.

All of a sudden, she saw the chief go down.� He had taken an arrow in the thigh and was immobilized.� She saw three of the attackers advance on the fallen chief.� Two of them had their bows at the ready.� The third had slung his bow and drawn his knife.� It was clear to Jill that they intended to murder the chief.

Adrenalin surged through her veins. She let out a yell and leaped forward with her bow aimed.� She easily killed the male with the knife with her first shot.� She reached the chief as she was aiming her second shot.� The two attackers stopped advancing, though. They had also stopped aiming their bows.� They and the two other attackers further back were just staring at her, dumbfounded.

Jill stood over the chief, straddling his body as she crouched, ready to fire again.� When the chief tried to get up, she placed her foot on his chest and pushed him back down, protecting him from the four men.

Her chest was heaving from the energy that was coursing through her veins.� She yelled at them in Incunu to leave.� She moved her bow back and forth from one attacker to another, threateningly.� Then, miraculously, they did leave.� They hurried back to their canoes and paddled away, leaving two dead behind.

Jill became an instant hero in the tribe.� Never before had a female defended the island.� She was given a name that she could not interpret.� It was only later in the evening, after the wounded chief had fucked his brave katahua that she figured it out.� He drew a little picture in the dirt.� It was crude but it was good enough for her to figure out what her new name was.� She was Leopard Girl.


Chapter 7

When Jill looked at the clock on her desk next, it read a quarter to seven.� She gathered up the notes for her lecture and then left her office to head across campus to the dining hall where they were meeting.� She was not looking forward to this departmental meeting at all.

The title of the presentation was �The Pros and Cons of Immersion Research.�� She would be arguing against it since she felt so strongly about the subject, especially after recently completing her first immersion research study.� Hal would be arguing in favor of it.

It was not the fact that she would be arguing against the chair of the department that bothered her.� Nor was she worried that it was her owner who she would be challenging.� She worried about what humiliating stories he would share about her.� And she worried about the pictures.

They had a video camera in the village.� It was permanently on and fed its images via satellite back to a server on the campus.� Jill had even negotiated its placement with the chief prior to Hal&#8217;s arrival and it was all set up when Hal arrived.

Negotiations over the thing had been difficult, not because the chief objected to pictures.� He just simply did not know what pictures were and Jill had difficulty trying to explain the concept to him.� She finally resorted to �it will help us remember.�� The chief thought it was a foolish request but he allowed it and even helped Jill figure out the best placement.� After she set it up, everything that happened in the village within view of the lens was saved in the computer at GSU.� Jill wondered what embarrassing pictures were going to be used tonight by Hal.� She did not plan on using any of them.

Dinner was nice and she enjoyed the company of her colleagues.� Then Hal stood up at the podium and called the meeting to order.� �As you all know, Dr. Wallings and I recently conducted research on the Pacific islanders that she has been following for several years.� This time, we conducted immersion research, which she has not endorsed in the past and still does not endorse.� Tonight, using a shared experience, we will present the cases for and against immersion research.� I will present the case for.�

He spent the next thirty minutes arguing his case and using stored images to back up his argument.� He explained how they had uncovered the core values of the tribe through immersion.� Images of him running naked through the gauntlet appeared on the screen as well as images of the tribe girl jerking him off during his initiation.� �Courage, strength, virility and a favorable view by the gods are what they value.�

Jill had already documented two of those values but she had to admit that she did not know about virility or the views of the gods.� She did notice that he did not show any of the pictures of his balls being dragged low by the rock, though.� And the camera was not positioned to be able to record him on his vigil on the point.� It was a shame that it wasn&#8217;t recorded.� Jill was certain that it would have shown a desperate man whose face was streaked with fear.� He did not comment on Jill during this section of his speech, although she was clearly visible in many of the pictures, standing in front of the chief with the chief&#8217;s hands playing with her ripe breasts.

�We also learned about the communal nature of child care in this culture.� As you can see in this picture, our own Dr. Wallings participated in the daily nursing of the children.�� The picture showed a boy sucking on one of Jill&#8217;s breasts as a line of other boys waited their turn.� Each of them was sporting respectable erections.

He went on about knowledge that had been gained about fishing and hunting techniques.� He talked about food preparation techniques that had been previously unknown.� And then he told them that he had a story to tell them.� The video started rolling.

It showed the raid.� The chief was visible in the center of the frame, gesturing and clearly yelling.� Others were standing in front of him, threateningly.� The film showed one of the raiders raising his bow and shooting his bow, downing the chief.&nbsp; And then it showed three of them advancing on him.� Two carried bows.� The third was brandishing a knife.

Suddenly, Jill burst onto the scene in the film.� There was no audio so nobody heard the growls or yells.� But they clearly saw her draw her bow string back and shoot, killing the man with the knife.� They saw the confused look on the faces of the remaining two as she continued to advance.� They saw Jill pull the second arrow from her quiver and aim it back and forth between the two raiders that were standing over the chief.� Then they saw as she scanned her arrow back and forth across the other two raiders who were standing farther back.� They saw Jill stand over the chief, straddling him in a crouched position with her bow drawn, clearly communicating that she was going to attack.� And then the video stopped, leaving the image of her, with her naked body glistening and her wild mane flowing down her shoulders and back, with a determined and threatening look on her face.

�Ladies and Gentlemen, �said Hal, �I give you Leopard Girl.�� He took his seat and there were a variety of giggles and chuckles around the room.

Jill stood up and walked shakily to the podium.� She was not sure she could speak.� She felt so humiliated in front of her colleagues.� She took a deep breath and then looked out at her department.� She set her notes aside.� She would not be using them.

�I am Leopard Girl,� she said.� And then she paused.� �I defended my chief.� And that is exactly why immersion research should never be conducted.�

�I am Leopard Girl.� And I defended my chief,� she said again.� There was complete silence in the room.

�Let me tell you why immersion is wrong,� she started again.� �He was my chief.� I belonged to him.� He protected me and looked after me.� I was his prized possession.� As scientists, how can we study and research and observe without letting bias and opinion enter into the equation when we are that close to our subjects?�

�I created a new role for their culture,� she continued.� �They have never had a Leopard Girl before.� Our role is pursuing science; not creating history.� In a male dominated society, who knows what the introduction of a Leopard Girl role will do?� It could change the culture and it could ultimately destroy it.�

�I placed myself in harm&#8217;s way through immersion research.� There is always some element of risk in field work.� But in immersion, you become one with the culture and that puts you in danger.�

�And finally, I killed a man.� I committed no crime.� It is not illegal in that country to defend your women.� But I will have to live the rest of my life knowing that I took the life of another human being.� I have no idea if he had a wife or family, but he probably did.� His children will probably grow up bitter and one of them will raid again someday in the name of vengeance.� And the harm that comes from that raid, and the next, and the next, will be a result of my actions in immersion research.

She ended her short, sobering speech with the image of her naked, glistening body still projected on the screen behind her.� �I am Leopard Girl.� I defended my chief.� No good can come from immersion research.�

The audience was silent for several moments.� Jill hoped that they would someday forgive her.� They were all good scientists.� And then there was a clap.� It was followed by another clap a second later and then a rhythm was started and others joined in.� Then the clapping tempo was supplemented with a chant.

�LEO PARD GIRL�. LEO PARD.GIRL� LEO PARD GIRL!�� The audience rose to their feet and kept up the clapping and chanting.� Jill looked around, confused.� Then tears came to her eyes as she realized that her colleagues were rallying around her in support.

Hal let this go on for several minutes before stepping to the podium, wrapping his arm around Jill&#8217;s waist and giving her a hug.� �Let&#8217;s hear it for Leopard Girl!�

The audience broke into raucous cheering and Hal gave Jill another squeeze.� It would have looked like a chaste gesture to most people but Jill knew that Hal was claiming his property rights over her.

�You have heard both sides of the debate now, �he said.� �We will continue this discussion at our next meeting.� But I have some exciting news for you.� Leopard Girl and I are returning to the tribe in two weeks to conduct another month&#8217;s worth of research.�

Jill gasped at hearing the news.� She had no idea.� She turned to him and just stared at him, astonished.


Chapter 8

Word spread quickly on the campus.� Jill had been popular before but she achieved a kind of celebrity status after her identity as Leopard Girl was revealed.

Posters of her naked, threatening form standing over the chief and brandishing her bow showed up in the hallways and on kiosks throughout the campus.� Her lecture halls were packed to overflowing and security had to be called in for crowd control.� There was a constant, long line outside her door during her office hours and she was frequently stopped in the hallways and asked to sign copies of the poster.

It was totally humiliating to see her naked body displayed everywhere.� She could not believe that the police did not tear the posters down.� She did remove some that were near her office but they were replaced by others by the next morning.� There seemed to be no escaping them.� But by the third or fourth day, the humiliation receded and it was just one more indignity that she resigned herself to.

Hal was enjoying all of this greatly.� He loved to embarrass his girl and this was just another in a long string of humiliations.� But he also loved the way that everyone wanted to be close to her.� He could tell that she was the most desired female.� And she belonged to him.

At the next club gathering, it was suggested that Jill be allowed to be a hunter at the next hunt.� Fortunately, the next hunt was scheduled to take place when she was back on the island.� She assumed that all of the fuss would die down by the time she returned and she would not have to be a huntress.� At least, she hoped it would die down.� She knew that she would get no pleasure from shooting and capturing one of her fellow slaves; unless it was Charity, of course.

She also knew that her absence from the hunt might mean that her husband would be required to take her place.� He absolutely hated the hunts, not because of being prey but because of who always stalked him.� There were several gay dominants and one of them had developed an interest in him.� At the previous hunts that he had attended, this particular gay dominant had stalked him and bagged him each time.� He had spent the night with a cock in his mouth or ass each time and had miserable experiences.

There were actually two club gatherings before she had to go on her next trip.� At the first one, Hal demonstrated the strength test of the Incunu.� He demonstrated it on each of the male slaves instead of himself, however.� Once again, Jill had to watch the painful exercise but, this time, she did not have the chief to support and comfort her.

At the other gathering, she was once again paired up with Charity.� She had talked to Hal about it and he had agreed to work on pairing them more frequently.� The entertainment at this gathering was a contest.� Jill and Charity would be competing against one another.� The contest was a form of wrestling match.� Each of the girls was oiled up, as was the mat where they would be competing.� The objective was to put a butt plug, a dildo and a gag in the opponent.� Once an object was placed, taking it out or letting it slip out would automatically disqualify that girl.� The first girl to place all three objects in her opponent would win.� The loser would become the property of the winning slave&#8217;s owner for two days.� So either Jill would belong to Janice or Charity would belong to Hal.� Either way, Jill would get to spend some time with Charity.

The bell rang to start the match.� Each girl wore a leather thong around her waist and the objects were clipped to the thong.� The girls started circling each other.

�So you&#8217;re Leopard Girl, huh?� chided Charity as she circled and reached out, parrying.� �Well meet Panther Girl!�

Jill smiled at her young friend and student.� �Nice to meet you, Panther Girl.� But I&#8217;m going to turn you into Pussy Girl tonight.�� The others at the gathering circled the mat and roared with laughter at the exchange.

�Go get her, Panther Girl!� shouted one.� �Stuff Pussy Girl&#8217;s pussy,� encouraged another.� They eventually started grappling but the oil made gripping one another difficult.� It also made it hard to stand and soon they fell to the mat.

Jill fell on top of Charity who had landed on her stomach.� Jill took advantage of the position and straddled the younger girl, quickly plugging her ass.� The penetration was easy do to with all of the oil but Charity still squealed as the large object was driven deep into her rectum.

Charity arched her body upward suddenly, knocking Jill off balance and sending her sprawling.� Now the tables were turned and it was the younger slave straddling the older one.� Charity was fast and she quickly slipped the dildo into the older girl&#8217;s pussy.� Jill was so shocked at what just happened that she was slow to react.� Charity started pumping the dildo in and out and then pushed it deep, ramming it against Jill&#8217;s cervix.

Jill gasped as the pain sent cramps through her belly and, once again, Charity took advantage of the situation.� She plunged the dildo back in again, eliciting another gasp and then quickly shoved the gag into Jill&#8217;s mouth.� The gag was just a foam rubber ball that was easy to squeeze into the opened mouth.

�Panther Girl&#8217;s going to catch herself a leopard,� taunted Charity as she looked down at Jill.� She reached down and tweaked the two slippery nipples and then reached for the butt plug.� This got Jill motivated and she bucked Charity off of her and then quickly got to her feet.� She started slowly circling the younger slave and then knocked her to the mat.

Jill sat on Charity&#8217;s chest as the teenager wiggled and struggled beneath her.� She clamped Charity&#8217;s nose between her fingers but they slipped off because of all of the oil.� She clamped it again, holding it tighter.� Because of all of the exertions and because she had exhaled just before her nose was clamped, Charity could not last long.� And as soon as she opened her mouth to breathe, Jill stuffed it with the gag.

�Hih!� exclaimed Charity around the gag as she tried to say �Shit!�

The crowd was very excited at this point and was cheering loudly.� Bets were being placed on who the winner would be and the odds appeared to be even.� But Jill had the upper hand at this point.� She was still sitting on Charity&#8217;s chest.

Charity had her legs pressed tightly together to protect her sex from the coming assault.� Jill slid down until she was straddling the younger girl&#8217;s waist as Charity continued to struggle.� Charity bent her legs and pushed with her feet as she placed her hands on the mat to push, trying to scoot out from under her opponent.� But the mat was so slippery that she could not get any traction.

Jill slid lower on Charity&#8217;s body and was now straddling her legs.� Charity kept sitting up to wrestle with Jill using her arms but Jill kept pushing her back down.� Charity was tiring out.

The end came swiftly after that.� Jill squeezed one knee between the tightly clamped legs and then got her other knee between them.� Using the strength of her thighs, she parted the legs and easily slid the dildo home.� Charity fell back onto the mat, defeated.

Jill decided to have a little fun at that point.� She started moving the dildo in and out of her defeated foe and spit out her gag.� Then she lay down between the parted legs and started flickering her tongue over Charity&#8217;s distended clit.� Jill was amazed at how well lubricated the girl was.� The oil helped, but Jill could taste Charity&#8217;s juices flowing freely.

The dominant who had appointed himself as the referee stepped onto the mat and declared Jill to be the winner.� But Jill just kept munching on her friend.� She kept moving the dildo in and out and then started doing the same with the butt plug.� Charity was so aroused by all of this sexual activity that she climaxed within thirty seconds of her defeat.

Leopard Girl had won in battle again.� And now the self-proclaimed Panther Girl belonged to Hal for the next two days.� It was Friday night, so Charity would have a new owner until Monday morning.


Chapter 9

Jill had to fly out the next morning.� Once again, Hal was sending her back to the island ahead of him to make the arrangements.� She suspected that he had arranged the timing of the wrestling contest and her flight so that he would have Charity all to himself for the weekend.

�Is that all you&#8217;re taking?� asked Charity.� She and Hal were driving Jill to the airport.� �You&#8217;re going half way around the world and you only have a carryon?�

�Well, it&#8217;s not like I need a lot of clothes when I&#8217;m there.�� This caused Charity to giggle.� She had seen the Leopard Girl posters but assumed that Jill wore clothes at least some of the time.

�You are naked the whole time?� Charity asked.

�Buck naked,� replied Jill.� �For the next month, I won&#8217;t see a stitch of clothing.�� In fact, most of the stuff in her carryon was for work.� She had some journal books and pencils and pens and two video cameras.� She only had one extra outfit packed.

�Wow!� exclaimed Charity.� �That explains your great tan.�

�Yup,� nodded Jill.

�Well, I&#8217;m going to miss you,� said Charity.

�I&#8217;m going to miss you too, sweetie.�

�Don&#8217;t worry about Charity,� interjected Hal.� �I&#8217;ll keep her too busy over the next couple of days to miss you.�

�Yes, I&#8217;m sure you will,� nodded Jill.

Charity and Jill hugged and kissed one another at the airport and then they left Jill to her travels.� The trip was long but uneventful.� By the next evening, she set foot back on the Incunu beach.

The chief&#8217;s wound had healed nicely.� He was very surprised to see her back so soon, though, since she normally only visited once each year.� And even though they did not have calendars on the island, he knew that it was too soon for her return.

�How is my Leopard Girl?� he asked.

�Your Leopard Girl is well, my savior,� she replied.� �I have returned to spend more time with you and your tribe.�� She went on to explain that she was back to learn more about their culture and asked to be allowed to join their tribe again.� The negotiations ended the same as last time.� The only difference was that Jill would not be displacing the chief&#8217;s usual katahua during this visit.� Instead, he would have two main girls this time until she left again.� Before leaving the beach, Jill was naked with her wrists tied behind her back.

As the chief led her to the center of the village, the children started squealing and jumping around excitedly.� The girls were excited because Leopard Girl was back.� Jill had become a living legend and a role model for many of the girls.� The boys were excited because their favorite breasts had returned.� She saw several of them becoming erect as she was paraded past them.

That night, the only thing that she accomplished was the placing of the cameras before the chief whisked her and his other katahua off to his hut.� He fucked them both as they assisted him.� The one who was not being fucked would suckle on the other&#8217;s breasts or kiss her.

Jill fell easily back into the routine of the tribe.� Again, she helped with the cooking and weaving.� And again, she let the youngsters suckle on her luscious breasts.

On her second day, she was given her leopard spots.� Several women were assigned to decorate her.� They had made a black dye and dabbed it onto her skin.� They created an intricate pattern of spots that went from her left shoulder diagonally down her torso.� The inner swells of her breasts were spotted but the outer swells were not.� Once the spots reached her right hip, they were continued down her leg.� Jill did not have a mirror so she could not properly examine herself but she could tell just by looking down at herself that she must look striking with these decorations.� She just hoped that the dye would eventually wear off.

The chief was very pleased with the new look.� He was so pleased, in fact, that he couldn&#8217;t wait to get Jill back to his hut.� So, he bent Jill over and fucked her in the middle of the village with all of the women and children circled around them as an audience.

Hal arrived three days later.� The chief was badly injured as was his other katahua.� Leopard Girl was gone.


Chapter 10

It had been the worst night of her life.� The other tribe had returned, this time under the cover of darkness.� They had crept into the village and gone directly to the chief&#8217;s hut.� They silently entered and then attacked.

Jill had tried to cry out for help but she had been silenced by a hand over her mouth.� She struggled and jabbed her elbows back, trying to hurt the raider who held her but two others quickly grabbed her flailing arms.� She watched with horror as the others stabbed their blades into the chief and his other main girl, knowing surely that they had been murdered.� And then she was carried back to the beach where she was bound and stuffed into a canoe.

She remained that way through the night as the men paddled.� She sobbed as she thought about her poor chief and wondered if this would have happened if she had not been there.� This was another reason not to do immersion research.� She would add this to her next lecture�. if she got out of this alive.

She tried to protest several times but each time she did, she was savagely kicked by the male in the back of the canoe.� She lifted her head to see if she could tell where they were or where they were going.� The male in the front of the canoe smashed his paddle down on top of her head, almost causing her to pass out.� She remained silent and very still after that.� They arrived at their destination at mid morning.

One male grabbed her under the armpits while a second one grabbed her bound ankles.� They carried her to the sand and then dumped her unceremoniously onto the ground.� A rope was tied to the rope binding her ankles and then she was dragged several hundred yards into their village.

There was a lot of whooping and hollering and many of the males pranced around her prone body in a kind of war dance or victory celebration.� This tribe also spoke Incunu so she could make out that she was a war prize and now was their slave.� There was an argument about who would own her but one of the males tabled the debate and declared that the chief would decide.

Jill was dragged to her feet and led to a post.� Her wrists were untied and then raised above her head and tied to the top of the pole.� They untied her ankles and pulled her legs apart, tying them to stakes that had been sunk in the ground.� She was left in the hot sun, vulnerable and exposed, stretched tightly, and utterly defenseless.� The mighty Leopard Girl was now a lowly slave.� She sobbed with tears rolling down her cheeks.

Throughout the day, she was raped and brutally treated.� Any male that walked by took advantage of her helplessness and fucked her.� Even boys availed themselves of her charms, although some of them had to pull over a log to stand on to reach her pussy.� The women, who wore loincloths in this tribe, unlike her own tribe, seemed to enjoy tormenting her breasts.� None of them were very well endowed themselves and seemed to be fascinated with the large breasts of the redheaded white woman.� She inherited a new name from one of the women and it gained acceptance among the rest of the tribe.� She was now �Spotted Udders.�

The women sucked on the luscious breasts and spanked them and punched them.� Some grabbed her nipples and stretched them away from her chest while others bounced them up and down, seemingly amused by how they jiggled.

This tribe might share a common language with her own tribe, that that was where the similarity ended.� They were crude and rude and brutal.� She saw nothing of the loving, caring tenderness that she so admired in her own tribe.

At the end of the day, a coffle of other slaves was paraded back into the village, led by two males with bows and machetes.� Jill assumed that all of them were also slaves and she saw that all of them were women.� They were also attractive women and several of them were indeed beautiful.� Two of them were oriental, probably Japanese.� Four of them were black.� And five of them were white, although they were darkly tanned now.� Their bodies were fit, probably from working, and they were all naked but for the rope that led from one to another and was tied around their necks and the ropes that bound their wrists together.

Jill was finally released from the post and was tied at the end of the coffle.� Then the coffle was led into the jungle.� Jill wanted to ask questions but did not want to incur the wrath of the guards, so she remained silent.� She could ask questions later.

They reached a clearing where three large cages sat on the ground.� The girls were released one by one and pushed roughly into the cages until each one held four naked females.� The cages were then lifted by ropes slung over tree limbs until all three cages were about six feet off the ground.� Then the guards left.

�How long will they leave us here?� asked Jill.� Most of the other women did not speak English but two did.� One of the Orientals was from California and one of the brunettes was from England.

�Until morning,� replied the Californian.

�But what about food?� asked Jill.

�We get fed in the morning and then again in the middle of the afternoon.� We go to bed hungry.� It&#8217;s like that every day.�

�Oh god,� groaned Jill.� �I haven&#8217;t eaten since yesterday.� I&#8217;m so hungry.�

�Sorry, hun,� consoled the Brit who was in the same cage as Jill.� �That&#8217;s the way they do things here.� Every day it&#8217;s the same.�

Jill had tons of questions and the two English speakers did their best to answer them.� She learned that they worked each day picking fruit which the tribe sold to the mainland.� Each morning, a boat arrived on the other side of the island to collect what was picked the day before.

She learned that Jackie, the Oriental, had been a student working on an archaeological dig on a nearby island when she had been captured.� The others in her party had been killed during the raid.� She had been the sole survivor and had been taken into slavery.

�How long ago was that?� asked Jill.

�I don&#8217;t know,� replied Jackie.� �A long time ago.� Maybe two years?�� Jill groaned at that news.� These people played for keeps.� Everything seemed so hopeless.

Emily was the Brit and she had been vacationing with her husband.� They had rented a sailboat and had made the mistake of anchoring for the night in one of the island&#8217;s many coves.� The tribe had boarded their boat, taken it to deep water, and scuttled it.� She was taken into slavery.

�What happened to your husband?� Jill asked.� �Did he survive?�

�For a little bit,� Emily replied.� �Then they ate him.�

Jill gasped.� �Ohmigod!!!�

�They have no use for males other than as a food source.� They eat all of the ones that they catch.�

Jill gasped again.� �That&#8217;s horrible!!!� she groaned.� These people were definitely not like her tribe.

Jill gave Emily a hug, trying to console her over the loss of her husband.� After Emily told her how they had disemboweled and roasted him, she could not believe that the petite, brunette was holding up so well.� But she supposed that time healed all wounds, as her grandmother used to say. She just hoped that time would heal the wounds of the loss of her chief and of her freedom.

They talked for a bit longer and then one of the males from the tribe walked past the cages.� He shouted for them to be quiet and sleep.� Jill shouted back in Incunu.� �We are too hungry to sleep.� Bring us your chief to eat.�

The male laughed and banged his bow against the cage, telling them again to sleep.� The girls in the cages all turned to Jill in amazement.� �You speak this language?�

�Yes, of course I do,� she replied.

�But how?� they asked.� �And why have you only been speaking English?�

�English is my native tongue,� she explained.� �And it never occurred to me that any of you would understand Incunu.�� All of them did speak the local language but one.� The beautiful blonde did not speak Incunu or English.� Emily explained that she thought the girl might be Russian and had been newly captured.

They spoke Incunu from then on.� They all wanted to know how Jill came to be captive with them.� She did not know how much she could trust all of the girls so she only told them part of the story.

�I was asleep,� she started.� �I was sleeping soundly with my chief.� They sneaked up on us, killed my chief and killed my sister.� They took me and brought me here.�

�Are you a katahua?� asked one of the girl.

�Yes,� replied Jill.� �I am katahua.�� This caused several of the girls to gasp in unison.� It was unheard of for a tribe to steal a katahua from another tribe.� It was even more unheard of for a katahua to be a white girl.

�I&#8217;m surprised,� said Jackie.� �They always just raid to get native girls.� They use them as nursemaids and breeders.� I have never known them to raid for a white girl.� They just end up with us by accident and then just use us for labor.�

�Maybe it was too dark for them to tell the difference,� replied Jill.� �They are probably regretting their decision.�

�Well, it&#8217;s for certain they won&#8217;t use you sexually,� said Emily.� �They use the native girls freely but they have no interest in us.�

Jill just stared at her incredulously.� After having been continually raped by every male between the ages of ten and seventy, she couldn&#8217;t believe that Emily could say something like that.� �Then what exactly would you call what they did to me today?� asked Jill.

�What did they do to you?�

�They raped me!� exclaimed Jill.� �All of them did!� Over and over again!!!�

�Wow,� responded Emily.� �I have no idea what is going on.�

The next day was a repeat for Jill.� The twelve of them were fed and the other eleven were marched off to pick fruit for the day.� Jill was taken back to the post in the center of the village and bound the same way she had been the day before.� Then the raping started anew.

It was harder this day.� On her first day, adrenalin had been rushing through her veins from the capture and the uncertainty that lay ahead of her.� That must have caused some form of arousal because she had been lubricated.� Today, there was no excitement or arousal; only dread.� She was dry.� The first male to use her found out the hard way.� He tried to plunge into her but could only get in an inch before her dry vaginal walls abraded his cock painfully.� He kept trying but finally gave up, slapping Jill across the cheek and making her see stars.

A second male tried with the same results and she was slapped hard again.� Then, one of the women had an idea.� She picked up a banana and coated it with coconut oil.� She jammed it roughly into Jill&#8217;s sex, causing her to cry out but the woman managed to get it all the way in.� Then she pulled it out, coated it again, and sank it home again.� This time, she pumped it in and out a few times before declaring that the girl was ready.� Then she was raped and raped and raped throughout the day.� The coconut oil did the trick for the first one.� After that, the semen from predecessors provided ample lubrication for those who followed.

To Jill, it seemed to be just an exercise in humiliation.� The males did not show any real interest in her.� She suspected that they were just doing the job they had been assigned.� Some of the boys seemed to show at least a little interest because they suckled on her full breasts as they pumped their tiny cocks into her.� The women were like the men.� They abused her breasts but did not really play with them.� They would slap them or punch them as they passed by on their way to do something more important.

Each day, this routine was repeated and each night she was returned to the cage where the other girls comforted her.� They also comforted each other and the gentle sounds of love making filled the air in their clearing in the jungle.� Nobody tried to have sex with Jill, though.� She obviously had enough sexual activity during the day.

On the fourth night of her captivity, she finally told the girls the rest of her story.� She told them about the raid.� �I don&#8217;t know if this is the same tribe that raided us, but I assume it is.� I think they are just seeking vengeance.�

The other girls gained newfound respect for their fellow slave.� Not only was she a katahua, which placed her near the top of the pecking order, but she was also Leopard Girl.� Everyone pitched in to make her life as comfortable as possible when she wasn&#8217;t being brutally raped.

Jill lost track of the days but she knew that it had been over a week since she had been captured.� Still, they continued her nonstop rapings every day and she wondered if this would be her lot for the rest of her life.� Surely they would grow tired of her body at some point.� But what would happen then?� Would they kill her or just have her become a fruit collector?


Chapter 11

It was shortly after midday and one of the youth had his cock embedded in her vagina which had already been lubricated with the sperm of over a dozen other males.� She looked down and saw the boy suckling on her breast and thought about her nursing duties back in her tribe.� How different the tribes were, she thought again.

All of a sudden, she heard arrows whizzing by her and saw a male go down nearby.� Two more males quickly fell and she heard one of them cry out for help.� Another male approached her with a drawn knife and told the boy to back away.� She knew that this was the end of her.� He held the blade to her throat but then cried out.� She saw the arrow sticking through his neck as he crumpled to the ground.

The sound of stampeding feet was heard behind her but when she craned her neck around, she couldn&#8217;t see anything.� Then, suddenly, they burst into the village from all sides.� She recognized them immediately and breathed a sigh of relief.� Her tribe had come to rescue her.

Arrows were still flying and the males of the other tribe were falling quickly.� The raid had been a complete surprise and they had no time to prepare to defend.� Then, the chief appeared before her and she fainted.� She had seen him murdered in his hut!� There was no way that he could be here.&nbsp; She must be dreaming or dead.

When she awoke, she was lying on a sleeping mat and was free of her bindings.� The chief was standing above her with his arms crossed and was smiling down at her.� A large bandage was wrapped around his chest and others were wound around an arm and a thigh.� �I came for my Leopard Girl,� he said.� Hal was standing beside him with his bow still in his hand.

�Thank the gods,� she uttered.� She started to get up but the chief placed his foot on her chest, pushing her back down to protect her as she had done to him during the first raid.

�Not yet, my katahua.� They already tried to kill you once.� Stay down until we have cleared their nest.�� The chief continued to scan the village, seeing his tribe chasing the other and seeing some of the enemy escaping into the jungle.� Finally, when he deemed it to be safe, he took his foot off of her.

Jill scrambled to her feet and gave her chief a hug, which caused him to wince.� �Sorry.� I wasn&#8217;t thinking,� she said.� �But thank you for rescuing me, my savior.�

�Nobody takes my property, girl,� he replied.� And for once, she was delighted to be considered property.

After they cleared the village, the chief declared that it was time to return home.� Jill remembered the other girls and asked that they be rescued.� The chief was not interested in any more foreign girls.� But when Jill picked up a bow and a quiver of arrows from a fallen enemy and started to head out of camp to rescue the girls herself, he relented.

Jill had no idea where to find the girls so they wandered for a bit.� Eventually, however, they did spot them in a little valley, collecting berries and being guarded by a dozen or so warriors.� The chief created a plan and everyone got into position.� Again, Jill was allowed to fight.

And again, they had the element of surprise in their favor.� The first three guards went down before they knew what was happening.� Another one fled into the jungle.� But the others stood their ground and fought.� Another guard was killed as the skirmishing continued.

Finally, it became clear to the guards that they were outnumbered and were about to lose.� One of the guards grabbed Emily and held a knife to her throat, obviously trying to use her to bargain with or as a human shield.

This infuriated Jill and she broke from cover and raced toward the guard, shrieking out a war cry.� The guard stood his ground and pressed the blade tighter against Emily&#8217;s throat, slicing the skin and causing Emily to cry out.� Seeing the little trickle of blood dripping down Emily&#8217;s neck was all it took for Jill.� She nocked her arrow and aimed, watching the arrow go cleanly through the center of the guard&#8217;s forehead.

Once again, a naked woman with breasts bobbing wildly had led an attack.� And once again, she had been victorious.� The only difference was that this time, the woman wore leopard spots.� The rest of the enemy quickly fled into the safety of the jungle.

Emily fainted from the ordeal and from seeing Jill&#8217;s arrow coming at her.� Jill got to her just in time to catch her and gently laid her on the ground.� The other slave girls quickly surrounded Jill and jabbered quickly and loudly, thanking her for rescuing them.� She smiled and then went to her chief who was standing nearby.� �These are the ones who rescued you.� This is my tribe.�

Again, there was a flurry of Incunu thank-yous as the girls started jabbering again.� Emily came to and was helped to her feet, touching her body all over to figure out where the arrow had pierced her.

�You have to stop doing that,� scolded the chief.

�Sorry, my savior,� replied Jill as she sank to her knees and kissed his hand.� �I don&#8217;t know what gets into me.�

�It&#8217;s the leopard inside of you,� he said.� �But try to be more careful from now on.�

�Yes, my savior.�


Chapter 12

They had not brought enough canoes for the party that they were returning with so they relieved the enemy village of some of theirs.� The girls were divided up amongst the canoes and were each paired with an Incunu warrior.� They were also enlisted to share in the paddling.

Jill rode with the chief and one other Incunu.� Because of the chief&#8217;s wounds, he was unable to do any of the paddling himself.� They set off on the long journey home.

�I thought you were dead, my savior,� said Jill as they started their trip.

�I was hurt but I lived.� Your sister lived also but she was hurt badly.�

Jill breathed a sigh of relief to know that her katahua sister was also alive.� It was turning out to be a happy ending.� The chief sat facing Jill.� He loved watching her muscles straining and her breasts swaying with every movement.� He knew that he had the best katahua in the world.

�What are you going to do with your new girls?� he asked.

�Oh, I hadn&#8217;t thought about it,� she responded.� �But they aren&#8217;t my girls.�

�You led the attack,� he said.� �You claimed them.� They belong to you now.�

�Wait!� she said after his words sank in.� �I didn&#8217;t think that women could own anything.�

�Leopard Girl is no ordinary woman,� he replied.� �Leopard Girl can own whatever she claims.�

�Oh,� replied Jill.� Now she knew for sure that her immersion into their culture was changing it.� �I think that I should release them.�

�That decision is yours,� he responded.� �But be careful.� Some of them might not want to be released.� And some of them might not be ready to return to their other lives.�

�Oh,� was all she said.� They rode in silence for a long time and the chief just watched the breasts swaying back and forth with a smile on his face.

By the time they reached their island, Jill decided on a course of action.� She would offer them a choice.� Each one could decide for herself.� They could be released and return to their former lives.� Or they could remain with the Incunu.� She could not imagine any of them staying behind but, if they chose to, they could stay as long as they agreed to live as the Incunu did.

Jill gathered the girls in front of the chief&#8217;s hut.� It was the first time she had entered the village without having her wrists bound behind her back.� All of the others were bound.� She explained their options with her hands on her hips.� She was not quite sure how to describe it to the Russian girl but she would deal with that later.� She spoke in the Incunu tongue to the others.

Most of them were excited and grateful to Jill.� Not only had she rescued them from that awful tribe but she was giving them back their freedom.� Transportation was quickly arranged for nine of them and clothing was made so that they could at least travel.� Hal arranged a satellite connection with the university and was able to get another professor to translate for the Russian.� She too decided to return home and she was quickly sent on her way.� Only Emily decided to stay.� She said that she had no life to return to.� Jill decided not to push her.� She said that the cute little Brit could stay with the tribe until it was time for Jill to leave.� Then Jill would ask her again.� She could go home or remain permanently with the tribe.

�Now you have a katauha, Leopard Girl,� said the chief after the Russian had been sent on her way.

Jill blinked.� �I do?� she asked incredulously.� �What about me?�

�Oh, you are still my katahua,� he smiled as he reached out and held her breasts.� �But now you have your own.� I hope you will share her with me.�

�Of course I will, my savior,� she responded.� In actuality, she was eager to share Emily with the chief.� Her sister katahua would be out of action for several more weeks.� And Jill&#8217;s sex was still raw from the week of nonstop rapes.� It would be several more days before she would be able to service the chief.

Emily turned out to be an energetic sexual partner.� It had been quite some time since she had felt a cock and she enthusiastically impaled herself on the chief&#8217;s at every opportunity.� Jill loved watching and, as a dutiful katahua, she assisted with the coupling.� She would grasp the chief&#8217;s cock and guide it into her own katahua and then would play with Emily&#8217;s breasts or asshole or clit while they fucked.

When they got back to the village, Hal had recommended that they cut the trip short and return home.� He knew that Jill must be traumatized by her ordeal.� Jill would have nothing to do with that idea, though.� In fact, she insisted on extending the trip to make up for the time she had lost while being held prisoner.� Hal was easily persuaded.� He was very much enjoying his own katahua and had expanded his harem during Jill&#8217;s captivity.� His sperm was being thoroughly drained by his girls.

But eventually it did become time to leave.� Jill&#8217;s spots had faded but were not completely gone.� She would just have to pick her wardrobe carefully once she got back to the university.� The spots on her legs meant that she would probably be wearing a lot of pantsuits for the foreseeable future.

Emily was torn in her decision.� She still felt that she had no life to return to.� She did like the tribe and was inclined to stay there.� But what she really wanted was to go with Jill and continue to be her katahua.� She had grown to love Leopard Girl.

Jill could not imagine how that would work.� She already had a husband.� She already had an owner.� How could she own someone herself?

Hal solved the problem by offering to own Emily.� Emily was delighted that she would be able to remain near Jill.� Hal was delighted because he would be able to own the beautiful little Brit.� He had not yet even sampled her charms but he had listened to her sexual performances with the chief and knew that she must be a little spitfire in bed.� Jill was not delighted but she was happy for Emily that she had come up with a solution that would make her happy.� Plus, this solution would relieve Jill of some of the burden of servicing the very horny Hal.

Two days before they were to depart, another boy was initiated into manhood.� Jill watched Emily&#8217;s reaction as the chief held Jill in front of him and toyed with her breasts.� That seemed to be his favorite pastime during these rituals.� Jill had to chuckle a few times as she saw Emily&#8217;s eyes fly wide open at times or saw her face scrunch up in a grimace.� Then, after the vigil on the point, the chief recommended to Jill that she have her own katahua complete the initiation.

Jill pointed out that Emily did not yet fully understand the culture.� He only replied that �she sure knows how to fuck, though.� The boy will be a man by the time she&#8217;s finished with him��if he survives.�� Emily and the boy were both grinning from ear to ear when she brought him back to the center of the village at the end of the day.

The day that they left, the chief had another surprise for Jill.� He had Jill&#8217;s spots freshened, much to her dismay.� Just as they were fading, she was to be marked anew.� But she could not refuse.� The spots were meant as an honor and it would be an insult to refuse.� She wished she had brought different outfits to travel in, though.� She had an open neck blouse and a skirt.� Some of the spots on her chest were visible, as were the ones running down her leg.� She had given her other travel outfit to Emily but it was no more concealing.� She would just have to endure the stares along the way.


Chapter 13

Fresh posters of Leopard Girl adorned the campus when they returned.� Either Hal had sent pictures ahead of time, which she could easily imagine him doing, or someone had hacked into the server.� Either way, the damage was done.� It showed her standing authoritatively with her hands on her hips.� The leopard spots were clearly seen running diagonally across her naked body and down her leg.� Her hair was a wild mane of red.� The backs of other naked girls of various sizes and colors could be seen in front of her.� This picture had obviously been taken when she was telling her girls about their opportunity for freedom.

Again, her lecture halls were filled to overflowing.� She gave up her plan to hide her spots since everyone had already seen them in the poster and just wore whatever she felt like.� She also decided to get back to combing her hair more slowly than she did after her first trip.� She would occasionally comb out her locks but, on most days, she wore her hair as the wild mane she had on the island.

She had a lot of adjustments to make.� At first, she was having difficulty getting back to wearing clothes.� She had grown accustomed to being naked during her latest trip and enjoyed the freedom.� Her clothes chafed and irritated her for the first week.� The shoes were especially bad and the bras were like torture.� She gave up wearing both and could be seen walking barefoot through the campus with her large, heavy breasts moving seductively beneath her blouse or jacket.

Having the freedom of her hands was another adjustment.� They had been bound behind her back almost the entire time she was on the island.� Now she never knew what to do with them.� Her solution was to just clasp her hands behind her back as she walked or stood.� This delighted the males and some of the females on campus because it thrust her delicious breasts forward, making them even more prominent than they were before.

But the worst adjustment was the cameras.� Everyone seemed to have one and all of the lenses seemed to be pointed at her.� It was like being constantly surrounded by paparazzi.

She did settle back into her old life with those minor adjustments, though.� She was once again Dr. Wallings and was not sure that Leopard Girl would ever reemerge.

Emily took up residence at Hal&#8217;s and became a consistent addition to the club&#8217;s gatherings.� Jill was surprised at how easily Emily adjusted to her life as a slavegirl, but she did seem to take to it readily.

Jill had taken a shine to the cute British girl.� She was always so enthusiastic about everything and took delight in every new discovery and adventure.� Jill supposed that kind of thing happened to some people after all that Emily had been through.� Either they would be thrown into a deep depression or they would get a new lease on life.� Emily definitely was the latter and she was living life to the fullest.

She also turned out to be a favorite at the hunts.� Jill and Charity were still highly prized but so was Emily.� Jill found it amusing that, at Emily&#8217;s first hunt, five different hunters had been stalking her.� As she stepped into a clearing, all five shot her.� She was a multicolor mess and an argument broke out among the hunters over who should own her. Finally, a judge was called in to sort it out.� But even that didn&#8217;t help.� When Emily said that she couldn&#8217;t tell what part of her body had been hit first and that it felt like all of the shots hit her at the same time, she was cleaned up and sent out to be bagged again.

It took no time for another hunter to claim her and she was the first catch of the day.� As entertainment that night, she was mounted by a Great Dane and fucked before the audience.� She was thrilled by the exciting day and climaxed twice during the bestiality and countless other times when she was alone with the master who had claimed her for the night.

One of the advantages of having Emily around was that Jill was not summoned nearly as often.� Apparently, Emily was keeping Hal sufficiently satisfied sexually.� And her husband was rarely called.� Every five or six weeks, he would be summoned and used but Jill was convinced that this was just to remind him who the boss was.� As a result of Emily&#8217;s presence, Jill&#8217;s life returned to near normalcy.

But it wasn&#8217;t completely normal.� While Hal may not have used her as frequently, he still exercised his property rights over her and would often loan her to other dominants.� He even threatened to loan her outside of the circle of dominant friends.� One time, when she was arguing with him over something, he told her to shut up or he would loan her to one of the fraternities on campus.� That ended the argument immediately.

But life was starting to become more normal.� She could have her Saturday picnics or go sailing with her husband.� It was as good as it could get until their term of slavery ended two years from now.


Chapter 14

Janice was one of the first dominants to borrow Jill.� It was Charity&#8217;s birthday and she wanted to give her niece a surprise present.� When Charity woke up on that Saturday, she found a very tightly bound and gagged Jill in bed with her.� Pinned to one of the ropes was the gift card.� �Happy birthday, sweetie.� Enjoy your present.� She belongs to you until Sunday night.� Love.� Your Mistress.�

Charity squealed with delight and quickly unwrapped her present and then retied Jill spread eagle across the bed.� She left the gag in so that Jill would not protest, even though Jill would have been unlikely to protest.� Then she feasted on her beautiful Leopard Girl, bringing her to orgasm after orgasm until mid afternoon.

Finally, she took out the gag and kissed her beautiful gift.� �Are you trying to kill me?� asked Jill once she could speak.

Charity silenced her with another kiss before replying.� �You belong to me, Pussy Girl,� she giggled.� �I can do whatever I want.�

�But I won&#8217;t survive many more orgasms.�

Charity laughed.� �Then my mistress will just have to buy me a new present if my love for you kills you.�� Then Charity dove between Jill&#8217;s thighs again and licked and nibbled her to another orgasm.

Charity was hungry and went down to the kitchen to get some food.� She left Jill bound where she was, though, stretched widely on the bed.� Her aunt was sitting in the kitchen, reading, when she arrived.

�How&#8217;s your present?� asked Janice as Charity entered.

�It&#8217;s my best birthday ever, Mistress,� replied the naked Charity.� She went to the table and hugged and kissed her aunt.� �Thank you so much.� I just love her.�

�I&#8217;m glad you like your gift,� smiled Janice.� �Are you going to keep her tied up all weekend?�

�Maybe,� giggled Charity.� �I just love playing with her body.�

�Yes, she has a marvelous body.� I hope you&#8217;ll share it with me later.�

Charity stopped what she was doing and turned to her aunt with a surprised look on her face.� �Oh, Mistress, of course you can play with her.� I assumed that since you own me, that everything I own belongs to you.�

Janice smiled and got up from the table, crossing the floor to her niece.� She lifted each beautiful breast in her hands and kissed the soft upper swells before kissing Charity on the lips.� �Thank you.� I think I would like to play with her.� Maybe later.�

�Yes, Mistress,� replied Charity.� She finished creating a plate full of fruit and then returned to where Jill was still bound.� She placed a raspberry on each of the leopard spots which, by now, were fading.� She stuffed a half dozen apple slices into Jill&#8217;s sex and then peeled a banana, stuffing it in with the apple pieces.� Jill shuddered when she saw the banana, remembering the gang rapes when she was a prisoner of the warring tribe but did not say anything.

Charity sat on the bed beside Jill and fed her new slavegirl the remaining fruit from the plate.� When Jill had finished eating, Charity went from spot to spot, licking sensually around each with her tongue before sucking the raspberries into her mouth.� Charity was only half way through the berries when Jill started moaning.� Charity continued her feast.

When the berries were gone, she lay between Jill&#8217;s bound legs and started sucking on her sex, using her tongue to try to scoop out the fruit.� When that did not work, she worked a finger in to get them and Jill&#8217;s moaning intensified.� Charity would trap a piece of fruit, eat it, and then wrap her lips around Jill&#8217;s clit which was very erect at this point.� She would pulse it between her lips several times before going in search of another piece of fruit.

Jill was groaning and writhing in her bonds by the time Charity got the last piece of fruit out.� Charity was not about to put her out of her agony by letting her climax just yet, though.� She had one more thing that she wanted to do.� She had never fisted a woman before and today she would do it for the first time.

She had been fisted several times and she knew that, if done right, it could be very erotic and pleasurable.� She slipped two fingers into Jill and twisted them, eliciting another groan.� Then a third finger joined in.� When the fourth one entered, Jill realized what was happening and protested.

�Hey!� What do you think you&#8217;re doing down there?� she said as she lifted her head and peered down across her naked form at her young captor.

�Just playing with my Pussy Girl&#8217;s pussy,� Charity giggled.

�Well it wasn&#8217;t designed for that,� exclaimed Jill.

�Oh, it was designed for pleasure,� replied Charity as her thumb joined the crowd of fingers.� Slowly, she pumped her fingers in and out, noticing how aroused Jill was.� The beautiful professor was groaning even louder now.� The fingers moved a little deeper with each push.� �Besides, my hand is a lot smaller than that guy&#8217;s was who fisted me.�

Jill gasped as Charity&#8217;s hand stretched her wide and protested again.� But Charity just kept moving her hand in and out of the slippery wet tunnel until, finally, her whole hand was inside of her temporary slave.

Jill took a deep breath and then panted as she felt her vagina stuffed to fullness.� She took another deep breath and panted almost as if she were in labor.� The fingers spread out inside of her body and she could feel them exploring their new home.� She pulled on the ropes holding her arms to try to pull herself higher to escape the fingered invasion but the ropes holding her legs held her tightly in place.

Charity took her time.� She believed that she could make Jill climax in a heartbeat but she wanted to prolong this exquisite agony.� Her fingers danced along the soft, warm vaginal walls, exploring slowly every surface.� She found her slave&#8217;s cervix and lightly tapped it with a finger, sending little shocks of pain through the captive&#8217;s body.

Jill&#8217;s brow was sweaty and she shook her head back and forth, trying to adjust to the uncomfortable fullness.� She continued her deep breathing and panting as the fingers went back to their exploration.

Charity gazed up from her position between the bound legs.� She just loved to look at her professor.� Every delicate curve was so feminine and so beautiful.� She saw the luscious, bountiful breasts jiggle as her captive tried to pull on the arm ropes.� And she saw Jill&#8217;s belly quivering which she knew was a telltale sign that she was nearing climax.� Charity let her hand go limp and still as she waited for Jill to relax.� She did not want her slave to orgasm just yet.

Jill groaned.� She had been so close.� Now all she felt was the hand filling her sex and the wrist stretching her open.� She tried moving her hips to start the stimulation again but it did not work.� She was completely at the mercy of her student and temporary mistress.

Charity sensed that Jill had calmed down.� Her breathing became more regular and her belly had stopped quivering.� Charity decided it was time for her next move but she was still not ready to let Jill climax yet.� She would just have to be very careful with her slave.

She curled her fingers and tucked her thumb in, forming a fist.� Then she started pulling back.� Her fist met resistance but she kept the pressure on, increasing the strain on Jill&#8217;s sex.� Jill groaned as a dull pain formed between her thighs.� Charity eased off the pressure and slowly moved her arm forward.� Jill could feel the fist moving within her belly.� Eventually, the knuckles touched her cervix and kept pressing forward.� Jill groaned again as a new dull ache formed in her body and cramps radiated from her cervix.� Finally, Charity eased off that pressure also.

Charity continued these motions.� She would pull her hand back, causing a strain, and then push it forward until it mashed Jill&#8217;s cervix and caused the cramping.� Slowly, she increased the rhythm and Jill felt the hand move inside of her more quickly.� Eventually, the tempo became quick and Jill was back to her deep breathing and panting.� It felt like her cervix was being battered almost as if Charity were trying to burst through into her womb.� Pain radiated constantly from her pummeled cervix.

Charity saw the belly quivering again and stopped all movement.� She tilted her head forward and blew on the slick, distended clitoris but did not touch it.� Jill groaned again as another orgasm was denied her.

Charity waited until regular breathing was restored and the belly was still.� Then she started her hand moving again.� This time, she picked up where she left off and was pounding her slave&#8217;s cervix, sending pain emanating from her battered organ.

It was time for her slave to climax.� As her fist continued to punch at Jill&#8217;s cervix, Charity&#8217;s lips formed an O.� She leaned forward and sucked the tender nubbin between her lips and started flicking it with her tongue.� The clit was only flicked twice when Jill started climaxing but Charity kept her motions up.� The orgasm seemed to go on forever as Charity teased her slave.� Then, just as she was starting to come down from her orgasm, Jill&#8217;s body erupted in a fresh one.� Still, Charity continued.� By the time Charity finished, she was not sure whether Jill had five orgasms or one orgasm with five peaks.� In any event, she had been climaxing for more than four minutes.� Jill was exhausted.

�God!� exclaimed Jill after she had mostly recovered.� �Where did you learn that one?�

Charity nipped at Jill&#8217;s clit with her teeth, causing the bound slave to jump.� �I just made that up.� I wanted to see how it worked.�

�Oh, it did the trick,� said an exhausted Jill.


Chapter 15

�How&#8217;s she doing as a mistress?� asked Janice as she entered her bedroom.

�She&#8217;s pretty creative,� replied Jill who was still spread and bound on the bed.� �She&#8217;s a good little mistress.�

Charity had been sleeping in Janice&#8217;s bed the night before so that&#8217;s where the bound Jill was placed as a present.� Jill continued to be amazed at the unusual aunt/niece relationship.� Apparently, it worked for them.� She could certainly tell that they loved one another very much.� But it must have been difficult when they were with other family members.� She wondered how often Charity came close to calling her aunt Mistress.

Janice sat on the bed and reached out, resting her hand on Jill&#8217;s breast and giving it a squeeze.� �These are twin miracles,� she said.� �So what did she do that was so creative?�

�Thank you,� replied Jill at the compliment.� She looked down and saw the other woman holding her breast lovingly.� She knew that this would be very uncomfortable for most women but it had become second nature to her.� It was not even something that she had to resign herself to.� She enjoyed being touched and handled and used by Janice and Charity.� And she loved Emily&#8217;s touch too.� �But if my breasts are miracles, there are six of them in the room, not two.� Both of you have perfect breasts.�

�As for her creativity,� Jill continued, �I should let her tell you.�

�Here,� said Charity.� �I&#8217;ll show you.�

�No, no, no!� gasped Jill.� �I&#8217;ll tell her instead.�� Charity grinned.� Jill went on to describe the prolonged fisting and the never ending orgasm.

�You should try it, Mistress,� exclaimed Charity.� �It was an unbelievable feeling to be inside of another body.� And she feels like a velvet glove; a very wet velvet glove, but so soft and tight.�

�I think I&#8217;ll do that,� Janice said, causing Jill to tense.� �But I think I&#8217;ll wait until tomorrow.�� Jill breathed a sigh of relief but knew that she would be dreading Sunday.

�Can I watch?� asked Charity.

�Of course you can, sweetie,� replied Janice.� �After all, she belongs to you.� Now should we let her up for a bit?� You&#8217;ve had her tied up all day.�

Charity sighed.� �I suppose so.� But she just looks so yummy like that.�

Janice smiled.� �You can always tie her up again later.�� They worked together to release Jill and she stretched.� Charity put on jeans and a t-shirt and headed toward the door.

�Do I get to wear anything?� Jill asked.

�Of course not, silly slave,� replied Charity.� Jill sighed.� She was not surprised.� She was not even disappointed.� She had known the answer before she asked but she had to ask.

They got a snack and went out to the backyard to eat it.� It was a cool day and Jill got a chill.� So Charity patted her lap and Jill climbed into it.� Charity held her slave while they ate to keep her warm.

Janice had been given a new pair of nipple clamps by her friend, Claire.� In actuality, Claire hoped to one day put them on Janice.� She was also a member of the club.� And, like Hal, she hoped to someday enslave Janice and her beautiful niece.� Janice had been planning on trying out the clamps on Charity but had not gotten around to it.� Jill&#8217;s large breasts provided the perfect opportunity.

The clamps were both beautiful and devilish at the same time.� When in place, a highly decorative pair of butterflies would adorn a girl&#8217;s chest.� Janice was sure that they would look lovely on Jill.

Jill&#8217;s wrists were once again bound behind her back and Janice asked Charity to make sure that the slave&#8217;s nipples were nice and stiff.� Charity jumped at the task and started sucking on the beautiful nipples.� She loved having any excuse to play with Jill&#8217;s breasts or any other part of her for that matter.

Janice walked up to Jill and kissed her.� �These might hurt.� I haven&#8217;t ever tried them.� They were a gift.�

�Yes, Mistress,� replied Jill.� She was used to clamps and, by now, had also become accustomed to pain.

The clamps were opened by folding the wings together. Janice opened both clamps and placed them on the waiting nipples.� The clamps bit into the tender little nubbins but not cruelly.� Very slowly, the wings started opening.

Jill looked down and admired the artistic jewelry adorning her chest.� �They are beautiful, Mistress.�

�Yes, they are.� Beautiful jewelry for a beautiful girl.�� Still, the clamps opened.

�Aaaaggghhhh!!!� Jill suddenly cried out as the wings were half opened.� The mechanisms contained a tiny needle in each.� Each needle had just penetrated the skin when Jill cried out.� Then, as the wings continued to open, the needles were pushed deeper into the sensitive flesh.� It was designed to hold the clamps in place so that they could be worn for an entire evening without becoming lost.� They were also designed to inflict pain.� Jill started her deep breathing and panting routine again as she felt the needles sinking deeper into her sensitive buds.

Jill&#8217;s nipples had been pierced but she did not usually wear her rings.� She did not remember her original piercing to be this painful.� She felt every bit of the needles&#8217; progress as they sank punishingly into her nipples until, finally, the wings were fully open and the needles stopped moving.

�What do you think?� Janice asked Charity.

Charity reached out and lifted both of Jill&#8217;s breasts as she carefully examined the new ornaments.� �They look awesome!�

Then she used her thumb to push on one of the wings, tilting the clamp to one side.� This also had the effect of moving one of the needles which shot pain through Jill&#8217;s chest, causing her to cry out.� �She&#8217;ll have to be a very good girl when she wears these,� Charity said to her aunt.

Janice laughed.� �Yes she will.� I had no idea that these would be so punishing.�

Janice fixed dinner and the three of them ate together.� It was one of the few meals at home recently where Charity was clothed.� Jill was, of course, naked and still wearing her butterflies.

After dinner, they watched a rented movie together.� Jill thought that it was a bit incongruous to be watching an animated family film with the other two women.� They acted like this was just a normal Saturday night.� She sat in Charity&#8217;s lap as Charity stroked her very wet labia and laughed at the movie.� Maybe it really was a normal Saturday night for them.� But the contradiction between the family oriented setting and movie and the way her body was being used and enjoyed was a bit unsettling.

They all retired to Janice&#8217;s bed after the movie ended.� The horrid butterflies were painfully removed and then Jill&#8217;s nipples were swabbed with an antiseptic.� They bathed together in the huge tub and then made love for hours.� At the end, they slept with Charity in the middle, spooning against Jill&#8217;s back and Janice pressed tightly against Charity&#8217;s back.

On Sunday, they slept late and had breakfast together. Then Janice and Charity enjoyed Jill&#8217;s body throughout the day.� For some reason, they did not let her climax.� They brought her to the edge repeatedly but always stopped before she could orgasm.� When she tried to finish herself off at one point, her wrists were bound behind her back again.

�Isn&#8217;t it wonderful?� asked Charity once Janice had wormed her hand into Jill&#8217;s sex and fisted her.

�You&#8217;re right,� replied Janice.� �Soft, warm, wet velvet glove.�� Charity coached her aunt to form a fist and, once again, Jill&#8217;s cervix was being pummeled.� Charity used her tongue to toy with Jill&#8217;s clit but always stopped once the belly started quivering.� Jill groaned in frustration.

Jill was given her clothes back after dinner and taken home.� She was so horny from being denied an orgasm all day that she attacked her husband in the living room and practically raped him.� Two more times during the night, she impaled herself until he could no longer become erect.� Then she grabbed a vibrator and brought herself to two more orgasms before she could finally sleep.


Chapter 16

Janice tried to control her breathing and keep herself calm.� She had seen others do this.� There was no reason why she couldn&#8217;t.� She crouched down and peeked through the underbrush as she tried to figure out her next move.

There had been a price for borrowing Jill for Charity&#8217;s birthday and that price had been her.� Hal agreed to the loan of his katahua, as he now referred to Jill, on the condition that Janice agreed to become his prey for a private hunt.� It would be only one hunter and one hunted.� Janice accepted the offer.

It was now a week later and Janice was holding up her end of the bargain.� Hal had drafted a loan document that laid out the terms of the loan and those of the hunt.� Janice would own Jill for two days to do with as she pleased.� The following Saturday, which was today, Janice would report to the ranch at eight o&#8217;clock in the morning, strip all clothes but sneakers, put on the safety goggles, and become prey.� She would be given a thirty minute head start.� If she evaded capture by five in the afternoon, she would be free to go.� A single hit on the torso would mean capture.� If she was captured before five, she would belong to Hal for the week.� Charity would also belong to him for a week to be named later.

Since school was not in session, Janice knew that Hal would have plenty of time on his hands.� And Janice knew that Hal had been lusting after her and Charity for over a year.� It gave Janice plenty of motivation to avoid being shot.

Her plan was simple.� She just hoped that it would work.� She wanted to stay close enough that she could keep him in sight.� She knew from her experience as a hunter that most of the slaves ran as far as they could, thinking that distance would provide them with safety.� It did just the opposite, however, in her mind.� It made them blind to their threats.

Janice reasoned that, as long as she could see him, she would know where not to be.� She used her thirty minute head start.� She ran quickly in one direction until she was safely out of sight and then circled around the back of a hill.� She climbed the hill and lay prone to watch the hunter who wanted to get her in his sights.

She watched as Hal headed off in the direction she had initially run.� Hal had brought Emily along, ostensibly to act as a porter.� But there was not much to carry and all of it was stuffed in a little fanny pack around her waist.� Other than that, her shoes and the ropes that bound her wrists behind her back, she was naked.

At that same moment, Jill was lying in bed beside her husband.� She had just recently awakened and stretched her arms and legs.� She was going to enjoy this day.� It was the first Saturday in ages where she knew that she would not be summoned.� There had been some Saturdays when she had not been summoned, but the threat of serving her owner had always been present.� She would get to enjoy this day with her husband, just like any other young married couple.

Charity was at her computer and was typing away at her latest erotic story.� She knew that her aunt was being hunted at this very moment and that sent mixed emotions through her.� She thought it was very exciting that a dominant, her owner, could be hunted.� She was not sure that had ever been done before in this group.� She was not sure how she felt about her aunt being captured, though.� Part of her thought that it would be very erotic for her aunt to be a slavegirl again..� She knew that Aunt Janice had been bought at a charity auction one time by her aunt&#8217;s best friend, Claire, and she had heard Claire describe how exquisite she had been as a slavegirl.� But Charity also knew what was at risk in the hunt.� If her aunt became a slavegirl to Professor Bascomb, then she would belong to him for a week also.� Despite not knowing how she felt about the hunt, she knew that her creative juices had been stirred, along with some other juices between her thighs.� She pecked away at her keyboard.

Janice kept the small hunting party in sight and stalked it cautiously.� She had been terrified and very tentative at first but by mid morning, she was feeling more confident.� In fact, the longer she was prey, the more feral she felt.� She took time when she came across a stream to drink from it.� She never would have done that before this day.� When she came to a pond, she scooped her hand into it to gather mud from the bottom.� Then, she painted her body with it, forming streaks and patches to help in her camouflage. 

Janice did not have a watch but she assumed that it was near noon when the hunting party stopped for a rest.� She watched as Hal took some food out of the fanny pack.� He ate and fed Emily and they drank from the canteen.� Janice knew that she should be hungry also, but she wasn&#8217;t.� The adrenalin rushing through her body staved off any feelings of hunger that she should be feeling.

The hunting party started moving again and, once again, Janice followed.� She made sure to stay behind them, thinking that it was unlikely that they would retrace their steps.� By this time, she had found an old discarded and deteriorated backpack.� She tore it apart and formed two strips of cloth.� With the help of the roping that held the top of the backpack closed, she fashioned a crude loincloth for herself.

She kept her eyes open as she moved stealthily through the forest and around the fields.� She picked up things that she found if she thought they would be useful.� By this point, she had found four feathers which were now braided into her long raven hair.� She also found a length of rusted steel wire which she thought might be useful so she coiled it and carried it with her.

She saw Hal and Emily stop again.� They sat and drank from the canteen.� Janice had been drinking from the streams all day and had no need to rest for water.� She took this opportunity to use the wire.� She wrapped it around her chest to measure it.� Then she bent it back and forth over and over until it finally broke.� She tore off more of the remains of the backpack and tore off two irregular looking pieces.� Then she managed to poke holes into the deteriorated cloth and wrapped the wire around her chest again, under her armpits and above her breasts.� She now had a bra.� It would not support her heavy breasts when she had to occasionally sprint across a clearing but it was at least clothing.� In actuality, it was like two bibs that draped over the full, firm orbs.

At the next stop, she tore one of the pockets from the backpack off and threaded a shorter length of wire through it.� She attached this to the cord around her waist.� Now she had her own fanny pack to put anything that she collected in.

A little later, Hal turned and started heading toward the ranch house.� Janice&#8217;s spirits soared.� Maybe he had given up.� She followed at a respectable distance and ended up back on top of the hill where she had started, lying prone.� She saw him go to his car.� Emily&#8217;s hands were unbound and a large backpack was placed on her shoulders.� Then the hands were rebound in front of her.

Hal pulled a second backpack out of his trunk and slung it over his shoulders.� Janice watched with a furrowed brow, trying to figure out what was going on.� The two turned back toward the hunt area and started walking.

Once they got out of the ranch yard, they stopped.� Hal fished around in Emily&#8217;s pack and pulled out a strange device.� He placed headphones over his ears and aimed a dish-shaped object off in the distance.� Janice&#8217;s blood ran cold.� Ohmigod, she thought.� They have sensors.

The worst part was that she had no idea what the sensors were capable of.� Could they hear her?� Could they detect her body heat?� Could they smell her?� She would not be able to follow as closely from now on.� She knew that.

She felt stupid.� It had never occurred to her that Hal would cheat like this.� During the club hunts, the hunters were allowed to carry their guns and water and rope to bind their captives, but nothing else.� Janice had assumed that they would play by the same rules today.� But, as she thought back on the agreement that she had signed, she realized that there were no specifications about what a hunter could use.� The only constraints were time and the fact that she was not allowed to go beyond the boundaries of the ranch.

As the hunting party moved, it would frequently stop and Hal would do a 360 degree turn with his arm and dish extended, obviously scanning and looking for Janice.� Occasionally, he would exchange devices but he kept stopping and scanning.� He had binoculars too, which he used to peer off into the distance.

Hal had obviously sensed something because he started walking toward Janice.� She ducked into the underbrush and tried to hide.� Her heart was pounding and she tried to calm herself.� Charity was able to deal with this.� She should be able to also.

He was walking straight toward her.� She knew that she had been discovered.� When he got about a hundred yards from her, she stood up and started running.� He just kept walking.� She ran out of breath and stopped, looking over her shoulder.� He was still walking.� She ran and hid and ran again.� He continued to walk, moving toward her constantly.

It was four fifty in the afternoon when the blue dot exploded between her shoulders.� She had almost made it.� In another ten minutes, she would have won and would have been free.

At five fifteen, Charity received an email.� It said simply, �Your mistress will be occupied for the next week.� Clear your calendar for the following week.� You will be similarly occupied.�

Attached was a picture.� Hal had strung up his prize.� Janice dangled from her wrists with her feet several inches above the ground.� Her body was still painted with the mud that she used for camouflage and she still wore her loincloth and makeshift bra.� The brightly colored feathers were also still braided into her hair.� Charity thought she looked beautiful.

Charity quickly forwarded the email to Jill and then called her.� �Oh my gosh, he got her!� I just sent you the email I received.�

Jill went to her computer and opened the email and photo.� �Wow!� she exclaimed.� �She sure went native!� She&#8217;s beautiful!�


Chapter 17

Hal was pleased with the outcome of the hunt, although he knew how it would end before it even started.� He had invested a fortune in the high tech equipment and felt as if he were now better equipped than the CIA.� He had been surprised that Janice had been able to evade him for so long, though.

The chase at the end had been exciting.� He owed a great deal of his success to the Incunu.� With them, he had learned three important rules about hunting.� Be stealthy.� Be calm.� Be patient.� With all of his electronic gadgetry and the fact that his prey was unarmed, he did not have to worry about being stealthy.� But he was very calm and very patient.� He slowly stalked her and bagged her.

He had tried to act magnanimous when he offered the terms of the deal to Janice.� She would get Jill for two whole days.� He would possibly not get Janice at all in return.� Only the luck of the hunt would determine whether or not Janice would serve him.

But there was to be no luck involved.� Hal was determined to capture the beautiful mistress.� Someday soon, she would belong to him.� And her beautiful, nubile slavegirl would also become a permanent part of his growing harem.

Hal drove to Jill&#8217;s house immediately after loading Janice into the car.� He had to deposit Emily somewhere for the next week.� He did not want any witnesses to his time with Janice.� Jill&#8217;s place seemed like the logical choice.� After all, Jill had owned her before he did.� Charity was already at Jill&#8217;s when Hal arrived.� He left Janice in the car as he led Emily, who was now wearing a blue sundress, to the front door.

They exchanged their pleasantries at the door.� Hal declined the offer to come in, saying that he had pressing business to attend to.� He left Emily with Jill, but not before taking the opportunity to taunt Charity.

�Get lots of sleep this week, slave girl,� he said to her.� Charity was dressed for once.� She was wearing cut-off jeans and a polo shirt and looked adorable with her blonde hair pulled back in a ponytail.� �I have lots planned for you when I collect you in a week.� You will be very busy.�

Jill had already decided to let Charity stay with her for the week.� Jill was going to claim Emily again as her katahua.� Charity could become her husband&#8217;s katahua.� She suspected that Bill would not mind his new role as chief.� And she suspected that he would love having three females to serve him and meet his every need.

Hal had time to think through his plan again as he drove home.� Janice was bound securely and gagged, so he had no worries about being distracted.� His goal was to break her during the week that he owned her.� Once he did that, Charity would belong to him also.� And if he failed to break her, although he could not conceive of failing, he would still have the following week to break Charity.� He believed that if he was able to get either one of them to permanently submit to him, he would get both.

He had envisioned several phases as he planned out the enslavement.� The first phase was to be romantic.� He would be charming and kind and would woo her.� There was a chance that this would be enough to cause her to agree to become permanently his.� It was a long shot, but he planned on wooing her at first.

There were three more phases to his plan: pain, humiliation and threat.� He had no idea what the best order was for those three, though.� Then, of course, there was always phase five in which he would have Charity in his clutches and would be able to play with her delectable body until she broke.

When they arrived at his home, Janice was treated like a queen; a naked and bound queen but a queen nevertheless.� She would spend most of the week with her wrists bound behind her.� He had grown fond of that look during his time with the Incunu.

He carefully removed the tiny garments that she had fashioned for herself during the hunt.� He admired her body but would inspect her more properly after she had washed the mud off.� He decided to let her keep her feathers for now and then led her to the bathroom.

For some reason, Janice was not embarrassed to be naked in front of Hal.� After all, she reasoned, he had seen her naked before.� Once was just this morning at the beginning of the hunt when she stripped by the cars.� The day that she had been sold for the charity auction, she was also naked and was sure he had seen her then.

Hal ran the shower first and used a washcloth to gently scrub all of the mud off of her.� Once the water was clear, he filled the tub and helped her to sit in the warm bubbly water.� Then he lovingly shampooed her hair and washed her body.

�See?� he said as his fingers worked the suds into her raven mane, �being captive isn&#8217;t so bad after all.� Is it?�

�I think that Charity would agree with that,� Janice replied.� �She seems to enjoy being my slavegirl.�

Hal rinsed out her hair and then picked up a fresh washcloth, soaping it and then running it over his slave&#8217;s body.� �There must be at least a little bit of slave in you,� he said.� �Otherwise, you wouldn&#8217;t have let yourself get captured.�

�I did not let myself get captured,� she responded.� She had to bite her lip.� She wanted to call him a cheater but did not want to anger him.� �You won me.� I will not say that it was fair and square.� But you won me.�

�Not fair and square?� Hal asked with mock indignation.� �What rule did I violate in the agreement?�

Janice again had to bite her lip.� She could kick herself for assuming that they would be using the normal hunt rules.� That was her fault.� She knew that Hal was sneaky by nature.� She should not have been so trusting.� �Look.� You won me.� Let&#8217;s leave it at that.�

Hal lifted one of the milky white breasts in his hand and leaned forward, kissing the firm, soft flesh.� �Yes.� And what a precious thing I have won.� I will truly enjoy claiming my prize.�

He finished her bath and then dried her.� He blew her hair dry, letting her mane become full and wild looking which was not a normal look for her at all.� Her hair had always been carefully coiffed when he had seen her in the past.� But the new look fit well with the colorful feathers that she had woven into her hair.� Plus, Hal needed to remove her from her normal life as much as possible.� This was a small change, but it was a change.

He intended to feed her but that would have to wait for later in the evening.� His first task would be to formally claim his prize.

Hal led the naked girl to his bed and had her sit on the edge.� Then he pushed her back and let her adjust her bound arms beneath her to get comfortable.� He took his time disrobing so that she would have time to think about what was about to happen.

He stepped between her legs and rubbed the tip of his cock through her petals, finding them already quite wet.� He had previously noticed that slavegirls were always well lubricated after they were captured during the hunts.� Now he knew that mistresses got that way too.� It must be something about the excitement and the adrenalin that got them aroused.

He slowly sank his shaft into the slick tunnel, letting out a moan as it enveloped him and squeezed him.� He started a slow in and out motion and leaned forward, kissing Janice.� She did not resist but she did not eagerly return the kiss either.� She knew that this was not lovemaking.� She knew that it was just a male marking his property rights over a female.� And he knew that she knew exactly what their coupling was all about.

His hands played with her glorious breasts as he continued to kiss her.� His cock continued to slowly saw in and out of her captive body.� She felt good to him and he knew that he was going to enjoy his ownership of her body.� He climaxed and spurt his seed into her.� There was no attempt to let her achieve orgasm.� He would do that later.� For now, he was simply marking her as his.


Chapter 18

Hal was a perfect gentleman on Sunday; as much as one can be when one owns a beautiful, naked slave girl.� He cooked for Janice and fed her.� He bathed her.� He fucked her often and made sure that she achieved an orgasm each time.� He cuddled with her and let her rest throughout much of the day.

Monday started off much the same but started to change by mid afternoon.� He asked her if she was enjoying herself and she replied that it was much nicer than she had expected.� He told her that it could be like this always for her if she would become his.� He even showed her an ownership agreement that he had prepared to make it official.� She politely declined the offer without even reading it, not knowing that things were about to change.� Hal was moving on to the next phase in his conquest of Janice.� It was to be humiliation next.

Hal led his slave girl down to the basement where he bent her over a bench.� Then he prepared a batch of soapy water and produced a rubber tube.� He was not in the habit of giving enemas so he had to improvise with what he had.� As soon as Janice figured out what was about to happen to her, she started protesting.� Struggling would have been useless with the way she was bound.� Her legs were spread widely and anchored to rings in the floor.� Her head rested on the bench, although her torso was off of it.� Her arms were stretched out along the surface of the bench and strapped down securely.

�No, Hal,� she complained.� �Please, not that.� That&#8217;s going too far.�

Hal swatted one of her bottom cheeks, enjoying the slapping sound that it made and seeing how firm her butt was.� �We&#8217;re just going to clean you out a bit.�

�Please no,� she pleaded.� �It&#8217;s too much.�

He ignored her begging and completed his preparations.� He hung the bucket high above her head and then greased her ass.� He unceremoniously pushed the end of the tube into her butt, causing her to squeal and thrash in her bindings as her bottom was violated.� She had never been used this way before.

Hal had to hold the tube in place since it was not equipped with a plug.� But he enjoyed the sight before his eyes and did not mind the inconvenience.� The naked, wiggling body was delightful to watch.� Occasionally, he would swat a dancing bottom cheek or bend over to watch her full breasts swaying beneath her as she struggled.

The water continued to flow.� He reached beneath her and felt her belly becoming fuller and tighter.� When she cried out as the cramps started, he massaged her belly to try to sooth the cramping.

When he was satisfied that she was full enough, he quickly withdrew the hose and replaced it with a butt plug.� The shape of this plug would keep it in place until he decided to let her void.� In the meantime, he enjoyed himself by playing with the luscious breasts, swatting them back and forth and tugging on their nipples.

Finally, he decided to let her empty.� He released her arms and secured them behind her back.� Then he released her legs and led her to the toilet.� He pulled out the plug and pushed her down onto the toilet and then waited.

�Can I have some privacy?� she asked.

�No,� was his simple response.� She held it as long as she could but, with all of the cramping, that was not long.� She loudly expelled all of the fluid, blushing furiously as she did so.� She had never felt so humiliated in all her life.

Hal wiped her clean and then helped her to stand.� �Again,� he announced.

�No, please!� she begged.� �No more, please!� That was horrible!�� She struggled against him but without the use of her arms, it was futile.� In short order, she was strapped back in the same position.� Hal mixed up another batch of the warm soapy fluid, increasing the amount of water this time.� Then he plugged the tube in and the water started flowing again.

Janice groaned as she felt herself filling up again.� The cramping started anew and she struggled against her bindings.� Hal alternately slapped a bottom cheek and then a breast, enjoying the sound of his palm against the soft flesh.� When she started cramping, he started massaging the expanding belly with one hand while the other continued spanking the girl.� When the bucket was almost empty, he crouched down to inspect his work.� He was very pleased with the results.� Janice looked like she was five or six months pregnant and he knew that she must be very uncomfortable with her belly so distended.

The routine was the same as he took her to the toilet.� After she had expelled the fluid, he cleaned her and then announced, �Again.�

Janice shrieked and struggled to get away from his grip but she was no match for a stronger male who had the use of both arms.� He quickly bound her back in the familiar position and prepared the third enema.� This one was with cold water.

Janice started shrieking as soon as the icy water started flowing into her bowels.� The cramping started almost immediately.� After only a few minutes, her body felt chilled and her teeth started chattering.� She continued to shriek and pull on her bindings.

Hal did not think of himself as a sadist but he had to admit that the sights and sounds of a beautiful woman in distress were appealing.� He watched her ass dance in front of him and loved the poetry of its movement.� He had learned that he could use only one hand to add to her torment.� He had almost accidentally let the hose pop out earlier when he used both hands to toy with her body.� That would have resulted in a mess.

This bucket contained even more water.� Janice definitely had the look of advanced stages of pregnancy and there was still more water left.� He decided to let the water flow a little longer.� Her hands clenched and unclenched and her shrieks had died down to whimpers and incoherent babblings.� Hal finally stopped the flow and dragged her to the toilet.

She had a dazed look on her face as he wiped her clean.� He dragged her back to the table and she did not even struggle again.� Instead, she just sobbed and mewled and begged that he not do it again.

Hal had no intention of another enema, however.� He had a better use for her ass now.� Once he had her secured to the bench again, he dipped two fingers back into the jar of lubricant and smeared it around her asshole.� Then he pushed the fingers past the tight little pucker, rotating his hand to smear the jelly around.� Janice groaned at the intrusion but the fight was out of her for the moment.

Hal lowered his pants and freed his cock.� He knew from previous conversations with Janice that she had never done anal sex before.� He was going to pop her cherry.� He knew that this would weaken her resolve even further.� At least it always did with Jill.� Whenever Jill was acting up or resisting, he would take her anally.� That would quickly eliminate her high-and-mighty attitude and make her docile and compliant.

He positioned his cock at Janice&#8217;s little rosebud.� As soon as she realized what was about to happen, she started screaming and begging and thrashing about in her bindings again.� She moved her hips back and forth, trying to evade the spear that was about to stab her.� But with the tight bindings, it was easy for Hal to hold her ass in place.� He gripped her hips and pushed forward, easing the tip of his cock into the forbidden channel.� Janice groaned as she felt her bottom being stretched and then howled as he plunged fully into her.

She thought that she was being split in two and she was certain that he must have torn her sphincter.� The pain was intense.� But it was only momentary pain.� Eventually, her ass adjusted to the intrusion and she was able to breathe normally again.� Hal looked down and watched as his hard member disappeared into the shapely ass, only to reappear as he pulled back out.� He had never tried fucking a cold ass before and made a mental note to do more ice cold enemas in the future.� He did not last long.� Her ass was tight and gripped his cock like a vise.� He unloaded his seed into her bowels and then pulled out.

He pulled his pants back up and left her secured to the bench.� He went upstairs, turning the lights off and leaving her to whimper alone in the darkness.

He returned two more times that day to rape her ass.� That night, he brought her a bowl of fruit and put her in a cage for the night along with the bowl of food and a bowl of water.� He knew that she would spend a miserable night alone in the darkness.


Chapter 19

He had Tuesday&#8217;s activities all planned out.� Before he started with the day&#8217;s activities, however, he put the romantic act on again.� He bathed Janice lovingly and fed her.� When she accused him of brutally raping her, he calmly explained that he was only trying to help her by expanding her horizons.� �How can you know whether or not you like something until you try it?�� When he offered her the contract to sign again, she pushed it away without even reading it.� That&#8217;s when she received her collar.

She sometimes collared Charity, more for Charity&#8217;s benefit than her own.� Charity thought that it was exciting and erotic to wear a mistress&#8217; collar.� Janice preferred the elegant, slender neck completely unadorned.� But she did collar her girl occasionally.� It was a beautifully tooled, ornate gold band that could be locked around Charity&#8217;s neck.� The collar that Janice received was just the opposite.� It was simply a black leather band with rings sewn into it for attachment points.� It was a dog collar.

Hal took Janice out to his car and stuffed her into the trunk.� When he opened it again, she found that she was back at the ranch.� �We&#8217;re going to have another hunt,� explained Hal.

Shortly after arriving, a truck pulled up.� Janice recognized the driver and immediately started pleading.� The driver was another dominant from the club.� He was not a cruel dominant but he was the one who provided the dogs that fucked the girls as evening entertainment.� And four of his dogs were in cages in the bed of the truck.

Janice begged for mercy but it fell on deaf ears.� They already had their plans laid.� Sam asked Hal if he could use the new girl before they turned the dogs loose on her and Hal agreed.� Janice was bent over a picnic table and fucked from behind by someone she had thought of as a friend before this.

After planting his sperm inside of the beautiful dominant-turned-slave, Sam brought his dogs over to her.� She was mortified as they sniffed her crotch and they jumped and yelped in joy at having such a tasty morsel.

�We&#8217;ll give you fifteen minutes,� said Hal.� �And then we turn the dogs loose.�

�Please, Hal,� begged Janice.� �Please have mercy.�

�It&#8217;s Master from now on,� corrected Hal.

�Please, Master,� begged Janice again.� But the begging was useless.� She hung her head dejectedly and sobbed.

�The clock&#8217;s ticking,� said Hal as he tapped his watch.� �You can let them have you here, though, if you&#8217;d like.�� Janice started running.

Sam called out to her as she headed toward the fields.� �Don&#8217;t put up too much of a fight once they catch you.� They can be pretty mean if they&#8217;re provoked.�

Janice kept running.� But she was no match for the noses and speed of the dogs.� Within twenty minutes of leaving the ranch yard, they were upon her.

It was obvious that the dogs had done this before.� They worked as a finely choreographed team.� One dog rushed at Janice from the side, knocking her off her feet.� When she scrambled to her hands and knees to try to get up, a second dog clamped his teeth into her neck.� He was not biting her.� But the presence of the teeth pressed against her flesh and the low growl was enough to still her.� A third dog quickly mounted her from behind and she groaned as the dog&#8217;s thick cock sank into her.� A second dog was just finishing with her when the two men walked up.

�I just love hunting,� said Hal as he strolled up to the spot where Janice was being raped.� �I&#8217;ve never done it with dogs before, though.�

�They are amazing animals if you care for them and train them well,� said Sam.

�Yes they are,� agreed Hal. �The same can be said of a fine slavegirl.� This one should be well trained by the end of the week.�

Sam watched as the third dog took his position on Janice and saw the canine cock slide into the kneeling girl.� Janice&#8217;s face was crimson with embarrassment at the treatment she was receiving.� �Yes, she&#8217;s coming along nicely.� Do you plan to keep her?�

�That&#8217;s the plan,� responded Hal.� �She&#8217;ll be a nice addition to my collection.�

�How many do you have now?� asked Sam.

�Two females and a male,� answered Hal.� �This one would make four.� And her girl would be the fifth.�

�That&#8217;s quite a handful.� Let me know if you ever need any help in training them.�

Janice could not believe her ears.� She knew that Hal wanted to own her.� He had made that clear ever since they met.� But she never expected that he would admit it to anyone else.� Now that he had, she hoped that his ego would not prevent him from releasing her.� He might end up losing face now if he let her go.

The men watched as the third dog finished and the fourth mounted the girl.� Janice had watched others with the dogs and couldn&#8217;t imagine that anyone would enjoy watching it.� She certainly didn&#8217;t.� She thought it was sick.� And now that she was on the receiving end, she knew exactly how sick it really was.� Nobody could enjoy this.� They must do it just to humiliate a girl and knock her down a peg.

The rape finally ended.� Hal clipped a leash back onto Janice&#8217;s collar and bound her hands behind her back once again.� She was hosed down once they got to the barn and then stuffed back into the trunk of the car.

Wednesday found her back at the ranch with the same four dogs.� Once again, she was captured by the pack and raped.� She was hosed down and stuffed back in the trunk again.� This time, Hal had another surprise for her on the way home.

It was mid afternoon when the car pulled to a stop.� Hal opened the trunk and helped a naked Janice out into the sunlight.� Janice gasped when she saw where she was.� The sign over the shop read �Sal&#8217;s Tattoo and Piercing Parlor.�

�Oh, Hal, you can&#8217;t mean it,� she said with a tone of severe disappointment in her voice.� When she had made the original deal with him to borrow Jill, she had actually been excited.� She had never been hunted before and she even thought it would be fun to try it.� She assumed that she could win that contest but, even if she didn&#8217;t, she thought it would be thrilling to act like a slave for a week.� It would be like a vacation from reality.� She had verbally sparred with Hal about his wanting to own her but it had always been light-hearted.� Things had turned dark, though, all of a sudden; very dark.� He seemed to be doing everything in his power to break her.� She was very disappointed in him.

Even after he had cheated in the hunt, she had still been hopeful and was looking forward to an exciting week.� She had been completely giving of herself during the first two days of captivity.� She enthusiastically and energetically made love with him and was enjoying bringing him pleasure.� Since that time, however, things had rapidly deteriorated.� She had been humiliated with the awful enemas, raped anally, and raped repeatedly by dogs.� Now it appeared that she was going to be maimed.

She tried to reason with him but he had his mind set.� He marched her naked into the shop and handed her over to the proprietor.� �The ones I picked out,� he told Sal.� �Just the nipples this time.&#8217;

Sal turned out to be a greasy looking fat male of some sort of Mediterranean descent; Italian, she assumed.� He put his hand on her shoulder and guided her toward what looked like a cross between a barber chair and an ob/gyn table.� Her feet were secured into the stirrups before her wrists were unbound.� Then, her arms were strapped to the arms of the chair.� A leather band crossed her chest just above the breasts.� Another one secured her to the chair at her waist.� She was completely immobilized.

�Payment as we agreed?� asked Sal with a hopeful expression on his face.

�Of course,� replied Hal.� �I&#8217;m an honorable man.�� Janice wanted to scream at that statement.� He was proving to be anything but honorable.� She did not know what the payment agreement was but she figured it out soon enough.� Sal dropped his pants and plugged her sex with his cock.� It was obvious that she was paying for the pierced nipples with her own body.� She was at least able to take some solace in the fact that, unbeknownst to Sal, his cock was swimming in dog sperm.� He grunted a few times and then climaxed.� At least he was fast, thought Janice.

The defacement of her body happened quickly.� Sal placed special clamps on her breasts just behind the areolae which squeezed the tips of her breasts vertically.� He took what looked like a leather punch and punched a hole in one nipple and then the other, inserting gold studs into each hole.� She screamed as each hole was made.� Once the studs were in, she whimpered as she looked down and saw the gold knobs on either side of her tender nipples.� Her chest burned with pain as she was helped out of the chair.

�You sure have beautiful slaves, Hal,� said Sal.� �Bring me all you got.�

Hal gave Janice another chance to sign the documents when they got home.� She refused and things went even further downhill after that.


Chapter 20

The remainder of the week was a living hell.� Hal had somehow convinced himself that his plan would work and, when it didn&#8217;t, he became furious.� He abused Janice horribly.� He also started drinking heavily.

The one bright spot of the drinking was that Hal passed out on Thursday night before he had a chance to lock Janice into her cage for the night.� Janice took advantage of the opportunity to call Jill.

�Hide Charity,� she told Jill.� �Get her as far away from here as you can.�� Janice described what had happened so far and Jill was horrified.� She knew that Hal could be slimy but he had never stooped this low.� She promised to protect Janice&#8217;s precious slavegirl.

Thursday and Friday were a blur of pain for Janice.� She was whipped multiple times and in every conceivable way.� Her back and bottom and thighs felt the sting of the lash.� Her breasts were whipped and her freshly pierced nipples caused her to howl in pain.� Her sex was whipped, causing her to howl again.� It wasn&#8217;t until he caned the souls of her feet that she screeched like a banshee, though.� She had no idea that feet could be so abused but she had never felt such intense pain.

The cattle prod was also a constant companion, especially on Friday.� All day Friday, he kept telling her that he was looking forward to using the cruel instrument on �sweet Charity.�� He had a maniacal look in his eyes as he pressed the tip to her vulnerable flesh over and over again.� And when he inserted the cruel wand into her sex and blasted her with it, she shrieked until she passed out.� When she awoke, it was still in her sex and he was still grinning maniacally.� She knew at that point that she would have broken if she had not already ensured Charity&#8217;s safety.� But Charity was safe and that gave her the courage to endure.

The hot wax was almost like a vacation after the cattle prod and the whips.� It hurt and it burned but it was nothing compared to the other pain that she had suffered.

Finally, Saturday morning arrived and Hal prepared Janice to return home.� She would wear the little outfit that she created during the hunt a week earlier.� Charity was to drive the car to Hal&#8217;s and deliver herself.� Janice would take the car home and wait for Charity to be returned to her a week later.

Hal kept going to the window every time he heard a car but would return to the scantily clad and kneeling Janice each time after he realized that it was not Charity.� Finally, Janice spoke up.

�She&#8217;s not coming.�

�What do you mean?� asked a stunned Hal.

�I have hidden her.� She will not be coming.�

�You did WHAT!?!?!?!?� raged Hal.� �She&#8217;s MINE!!!�

�She is not coming.� I had her hidden.� And if you ever come near her again, I will have you arrested if I don&#8217;t kill you first.�

Hal broke into a fit of rage.� He picked up a lamp and smashed it to the floor.� He grabbed a bookshelf and tore it off the wall, sending the contents scattering on the floor.� Then he approached Janice and swung his arm, catching the side of her face with the back of his hand, making her see stars.� She crumpled to the floor.� He was furious.� He kicked her in the ribs and then again in the stomach.� Then he stopped.

�Oh my god!� he uttered.� �What have I done?�

Janice slowly got to her feet.� Hal&#8217;s blow had split her lip and she wiped the blood off with the back of her hand.� She just glared at him silently.

Hal realized that he had lost it.� He should have seen it earlier but he got sucked into the &#8216;game.&#8217;� He had wanted to be with this woman forever.� Now, he had driven her away.� �I am so sorry,� he said.

�Stay away from Charity,� she said again, �or I will kill you.�

�I will.� I will.�� Hal gave Janice clothes to wear and then drove her home.� He agreed to release Emily and Jill and her husband in exchange for Janice not pressing charges.

All of a sudden, Janice had four slaves.� She adored Jill and her husband.� She did not know Emily well but she seemed like a lovely girl, too.� But she deeply loved Charity and she loved owning her niece.� She did not want to risk that relationship by spreading her time over so many slaves.

The first thing that she did was to meet with Jill.� Jill was kneeling at her new mistress&#8217; feet a week after the incident with Hal.� �I&#8217;m giving you back your freedom, little one,� said Janice as she cradled Jill&#8217;s full breasts in her palms.� She slowly worked the thumbs across the silky flesh and knew that she was missing an opportunity to enjoy this delightful creature forever.� She also knew that Charity would miss having Jill as a playmate.� �And your husband.� The two of you were trapped by an evil man.� You never should have been enslaved in the first place.�

�Really, Mistress?� asked Jill with tears in her eyes.

Janice leaned down and kissed Jill&#8217;s forehead as she gave each plump breast a loving squeeze.� �Yes, really, dear.� You are welcome to play, but you do it only when you want to from now on.�

Jill was overwhelmed.� She moved closer to Janice and hugged her around the knees, placing her head in Janice&#8217;s lap and wept.� �Thank you, Mistress.�

Janice combed her fingers through the red locks in her lap and admired the perfect nude before her.� �You are welcome, love.� It&#8217;s time for you and your husband to start enjoying your life together again.�

�Thank you, Mistress.� But I can come back, can&#8217;t I?�

�Yes, pet.� You may come back any time you want.� But as a sub this time; not a slave.�

Emily was a tougher decision.� Janice and Jill discussed her for a long time.� Janice was surprised during the discussion though.� She had released Jill and told her she was free but Jill made no attempt to get dressed.� She just continued to kneel naked at her mistress&#8217; feet.

Jill told Janice about Emily&#8217;s past and how she had already turned down her freedom twice.� Jill recommended that the girl be given the offer again.

�And what happens if she chooses to remain a slave?� asked Janice.� �Will you own her?�

�Oh,� replied Jill.� She thought long and hard before replying.� �Could we co-own her?�

�You don&#8217;t want to own her completely?� asked Janice.

�I probably do, Mistress,� explained Jill.� �But I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m ready for that yet.�

It was finally agreed that Emily would have two owners if she remained as a slave.� Jill could assume full ownership at any point in the future that she decided.� The two of them met with Emily and offered the girl her freedom.� For the third time, Emily explained that she had no life to return to and she rejected the offer.� She became the joint property of Janice and Jill.

Hal left the club.� He realized that control over another human was like an intoxicant to him.� And he was addicted to it.� He began his recovery process which meant that he had to abstain from any participation in the lifestyle.

Jill had to make a tough decision.� She either had to find another culture to study for her research or accept immersion.� She explained it to one of her colleagues.� �Once the toothpaste is out of the tube, you can&#8217;t put it back.�� She had become part of their culture and their culture had become part of her.� She could no longer be an outside observer with the Incunu.

She chose to continue with immersion research.� She also increased the frequency of her visits.� Now, she spent one month out of every three as Leopard Girl.� The beautiful, naked huntress always took her katahua back to the island with her when she visited.� The chief was delighted.� Now he got to enjoy his Leopard Girl every third month and he truly loved exploring every inch of her lovely body.� He also got to enjoy Leopard Girl&#8217;s energetic and enthusiastic katahua who made sure that his balls were constantly drained.� Life was very good on the island.

The End
