My best friends and I,
Mandy, usually went camping in Canada every spring break. This spring was no
different. I was driving, and my friend Sally was in the passenger seat. In the
back, talking about her new boyfriend was Amanda. Sally was half turned, talking
with Amanda. Since it was still pretty cold out, we were all still wearing
jeans and sweaters we hadn't put away from the winter. In addition, I had to be
careful of the road, since it's not often used and it was known to have slick
patches of dirt and snow mixed. We called it Smud, since it was fun to say.

We were only a mile from the spot in the woods where
we usually camped, when� Sally said she
thought she saw a car off the road, down the hill. Sure enough, as I looked I
saw headlights shining up the hill from between a couple trees. I also saw
other headlights, so I assumed the worst. Amanda was already calling 9-1-1 when
I stopped the car.

As we got out of the car, Amanda announced that she
wasn't getting a signal. As Sally and I got out our own phones to see if they
had any signal, someone ran past us, behind my car. The runner was on the other
side of the road and down the hill before any of us got a good look at them,
and by that time there was too much brush and trees in the way for us to even
know where they went, except down. Sally shouted, �Hey, wait, what happened?!�

By the time she was done shouting, all was quiet
again. Very quiet. There weren't even any trace noises from the runner. In
fact, there were no horns, or car alarms, or voices, or even the sound of car
engines or fire. The ominous glow made it seem like there should have been a
fire, though. There weren't even any animals around.

�Come on, let's go see what happened and if we can
help.� said Sally.

Though I started down the hill with my two friends, I
announced �I don't know, this seems so weird. What would other cars being doing
way out here anyway? Why are there no noises?�

The hill was steep and we had to almost climb down
it, so our attention was on the climb more than the car lights. Sally was the
first one down. Before I got to the bottom to turn around, I heard her say �Oh
my god... Mandy, look.�

Her voice was so calm, yet it had an intangible,
horrified quality in it. That's when I heard Amanda scream. I looked down to
her just when she stopped screaming. Both of them were staring at the wreck. I
looked up, still having a vantage point above them on the hill. What I saw on
that day will forever be burned into my memory.

Before us was a large saucer shaped thing, just like
out of the movies. It had to be a hundred or more feet wide, and at least
thirty feet tall. What we thought were headlights from the top of the car were
actually lights mounted along the perimeter of the saucer, and the eerie glow
was a bright light coming from the the bottom of the craft. There was what
looked like a loading door open, spewing forth a bright, orange glow. There
were five people silhouetted by the light, standing on the ramp leading to the
doorway.

I was terrified. More terrified than I had ever been
in my entire life. I was too scared to move, and both of my friends seemed to
be in the same state. The people slowly walked towards us. Their heads were so
large. Their eyes proportionally huge compared to the rest of their head, and
without any color. Just black. Their bodies seemed skinny and they walked with
a peculiar gate. Their skin was a dull, earthy tone. I was looking at 'Greys',
a kind of space alien I wouldn't know what to call until a much later date. One
of them seemed to be holding something. It pressed a button on the device, and
then I remember falling into blackness.

*������� *���������������� *���������������� *���������������� *���������������� *���������������� *���������������� *���������������� *

The next thing I knew, I was groggy and waking up in
a very dark room. There were noises, but none of them were very defined, and
they all seemed to blend together into a low humming with a pitch and frequency
that altered. It was cold. I tried to sit up, to get a better idea where I was,
but I could not move. I was spread out, and tilted an angle I couldn't yet
determine. That's when I realized I was totally nude. If the slight breezes
told me correctly, I was completely hairless, as well. No hair at all,
anywhere. The surface behind me was cold and metallic.

The fear I had felt earlier was still there. Not
quite as potent, but still enough that I didn't move. I remembered what had
happened. That fact scared me, but the fear from the memory wasn't as severe as
the sheer terror I had felt earlier. I didn't have time to be confused by that.
I had to figure out what was happening. My arms were secured at the shoulder,
elbow, and wrist. Even my fingers were secured at each knuckle, and spread out
flat against the surface behind me. My legs were in a similar state, though my
feet seemed to be resting on an angled portion of the surface I was on. My legs
were held at an almost hundred degree angle apart. My head was held in place by
one metallic strap round my forehead, and another wrapped around my mouth. One
last strap was around my waist. All the straps seemed somewhere from a couple
inches wide to less than half of one.

All the bindings were so tight that I couldn't budge
an inch, though the terror may have made movement more difficult than it would
otherwise have been. However, my circulation seemed fine. My head was resting
on another part of the surface with an altered angle. I was looking down at my
own naked body. It was so dark that I could barely make even it out, though.

Then a light was turned on, respectively, right in
front of me. My head was angled to not see the source of the light, but it was
so bright I had to close my eyes in pain. It took me a few minutes to adjust to
the light. When I could open them, I saw objects held above me by swing arms.
The devices looked varied and without a purpose that I could discover through
simply looking at them. I realized that part of the surface I was on held walls
around my head so that I could only look down at myself, with only a minimal
amount of sight above or to the sides. It seemed those were new, but I didn't
remember them being put there.

That's when a shiny hand was placed on my belly, from
my left. It had three fingers and a thumb, all long and thin. It looked slimy,
but it felt dry. I was still too terrified to do anything but watch. I could
only see the hand and most of the forearm. The hand was partially hidden from
my view, thanks to my D cup breasts.

The hand felt my belly, then lifted an inch or two
from my skin. I could make out a small device in it's hand. The device sent an
exceptionally thin beam of reddish light down to my belly, and I felt an
intense burning where it touched me, about two inches to the left of my belly
button. I had never had any major injuries before, just cuts and bruises. This
hurt more than any of them, enough to get me to scream and become more fearful.
My scream was non-existent. It felt as though my mouth simply refused to scream,
as though it were too scared to attempt anything. The device was moved just
over an inch to the left, me powerless and in pain, and the hand with the
device disappeared

I could clearly see that the device left a gaping
wound in my belly. It wasn't bleeding, so I presumed it was cauterized. A rod
came into view moving slowly down from above my meager view. It was under an
inch wide, and it had a psuedospherical, brass colored thing on the end. My
fear disallowed me doing anything still, as the sphere pressed against the
wound. The pain was worse than when the wound was created, and the sphere
disappeared into me. The pain grew as the rod slowly slid further into my
abdomen.

When it stopped moving, the pain dulled, but
remained. Another, or maybe the same, hand seemed to inspect my belly where it
had been run through, pressing down slightly and causing surprising pain. I was
trembling, I noticed. The hand rested, the rod sticking in me between it's
forefinger and thumb. A slight heat grew in my abdomen. I stopped trembling.
The heat, however, did not subside. It continued to grow. It felt as though I
had been stabbed by a curling iron.

I was still scared, but having some unknown metal rod
stabbed into your belly and an alien's hand on the wound will get a girl to
act. I was able to overcome the fear enough to pull against my bonds. Only
momentarily, though. All my muscles relaxed. I could still try to use them, I
think, but it was as though my limbs had fallen asleep. I could still feel
them. I was also then aware that's what happened when I tried to scream. My
mouth was asleep.

The burning intensified. I thought I was going to
die, being cooked from the inside out. The heat seemed to roll out of my anus
and vagina. I couldn't say how hot my insides felt to me. I've never been
severely burned. I imagined I had third degree burns and missing organs,
though. Then the rod left my belly quickly, and the hand left my view. I still
felt like I was cooking inside, but I was cooling off. After mere moments, it
felt as though it was simply extra warm. The wound next to my belly button
looked the same as it had. I could see the pink of my flesh, but it still did
not bleed. That's when I noticed that something warm was dripping out of both
my anus and my vagina. My first reaction was that it was blood. I would watch
blood drain from me as I died. As it rolled down the surface I was on, though,
I could see it was a translucent yellow-green color.

One of the hands grabbed one of the devices on swing
arms, and pulled it down beneath my legs. Even though something had just been
inside my belly, this made me feel even more helpless and exposed, seeing the
top of the device above my hairless vulva lips. The device itself was a white,
metallic cylinder, about seven inches wide. It had holes on the side facing me
that I saw as it was placed there. I heard an ever so slight mechanical whine
from the device, and I felt something smooth and rounded pressing against my
anus. I realized how naive I was to call people who claimed to have been anally
probed lunatics. The device did not wait for me to relax, it did not slow down,
it simply continued on past my unconsciously resisting anus. Of course, this
didn't hurt like the rod in my belly, but it still hurt as it ripped through my
anus and into my colon. It seemed to press further into me than my guts would
allow, but they didn't have a say in it. I felt a severely painful pressure in
my guts.

I watched as another object I could only assume was
like the one in my colon protruded from the hole just past my bare pussy. It
was easily two inches wide and rounded at the top. It, like the one in my
colon, pressed against and then into my vagina without hesitation or patience.
It pressed against my cervix. It seemed to slow greatly, but there was a
burning, tearing pain, and it continued into me at a snail's pace. The pain
reached an apex and the object accelerated to it's original speed. I felt
another painful pressure in my gut that only increased as the object went
further. When I though I would pass out from the pain, I was suddenly very,
very awake and focused. I cursed the pain for not allowing me to escape into
unconsciousness. Then the rod stopped.

It was difficult to breath. I lied there for
uncounted minutes, in agony. I was unable to do anything but stare at myself,
the bulge in my belly, and the device violating me. A couple hands roughly
grabbed my vulva and separated the lips. It duplicated the action with my
labia, peeling them away from the rod�
until they had worked their way up to my clit. One of the hands grabbed
it and pulled on it lightly. It hurt, but it was nothing compared to what I had
gone through already. I was more fearful and embarrassed, helpless and exposed
to horrible, horrible creatures who seemed to be inflicting pain for the joy of
it.

I don't know how the creature did it, but it slid a
small, short, metal tube around my clitoris It seamed to squeeze my clit more
painfully than the monster had been holding it. The hand that did all that let
go and the tube remained surrounding my clit. The hand disappeared from view,
and reappeared a moment later, with what looked like the same device that cut
open my belly. My fear increased. I thought they were going to remove my
clitoris. However, the device was to the side, and began burning the very base
of my labia. Though barely, this sharp pain was the worst I had felt. The
device slowly moved up one side, and I could see my labia hanging, detached as
it neared my clit.

I remember fearing for my labia greatly. While it may
not be vital in any way, it was part of my body, and I certainly did not want
it removed. I desperately tried to move my limbs, fight the bonds. I willed my
thoughts into the heads of my captors 'Do not do this! STOP!', but to no avail.
The device stopped, and was moved to the other side. Then I tried again, but
that side of my labia hung freely from a little flesh near my clitoris Both
sides had been nearly completely detached. I realized for just a moment that I
wasn't crying. I tried to cry, to blur the image I couldn't stop looking at,
but I seemed incapable of it.

The beam burned around my clitoris It seemed to go
slower, the pain more intense. When it made a full circle, it was turned off
and put out of sight. My defaced vulva ached, but did not have any sharp pain
any more. The hand that had done all of that, without any effort, pressed the
labia hugging the rod down the length of the rod. It twisted like a fleshy
rubber band as it moved down to the base of the rod.

The hand suddenly had the device again. Again I
wished I could cry. The pain was unbearable, though I somehow bared it, as it
circled my outer vulva lips. They, too, were removed, rolled uncaringly down
the rod. My bare pussy, once whole, was nothing more than a hole with a clit
jutting out above it.

The tube was removed from my clit, and a syringe was
in the monster's hand. I wished desperately to wake up, that this was a dream.
An ending dream. But the syringe punctured my clit right at the tip. The pain barely
registered, I wanted nothing more than to be out of the situation, even if my
labia were never again found. The syringe made a click, then was removed. The
hands left my view. Minutes passed and nothing happened. Then, when I thought I
would be left alone and possibly returned to where we found the saucer after
worrying about the pieces of my vulva I could still see stretched around the
rod., there was a tingling and dull, blunt pain in my clitoris

As the pain increased, I noticed my clit was beginning
to swell. The pain suddenly multiplied exponentially. This was the worst pain
that can possibly exist, I imagined. How I didn't pass out must have been a
trick of the monstrous captors. I could not keep my eyes open. As the pain
subsided, I heard a meager whine from my throat. As soon as I noticed it, it
was gone. I looked back to my clit, with eyes kept wet enough to see, but still
not crying. I doubted what I saw for a few moments. My clit had grown. It was
now five inches long, about one inch wide. It rested against the rod, hanging
down and touching my removed parts.

One of the hands reached down to just above my clit
and rubbed my skin. It made some exotic motion with it's hand, indicating my
clit, I think, and then it touched my clit. It touched my clit softly. The
touch was the most pleasant, most arousing, wonderful sensation I had ever
felt. It was pleasure I never imagined possible. It stroked my clit a couple
dozen times, and I had the most powerful orgasm ever. Everything I sensed was
pleasant, everything that was once pain felt wonderful. I writhed with the
climax, and fell back into darkness.














I awoke in a barren white room

I awoke in a barren white
room. The floor, walls, and ceiling all appeared to be made of the same stuff,
the same white color. It was dead quite. The room was illuminated by some
unseen force, perhaps the walls made the light themselves, as I did not see my
shadow. The room was probably thirty feet cubed. No doors or windows. That was
not my biggest priority, though.

As I rolled over to sit up, I could feel a slight
weight against my left thigh, as though something was hanging from my crotch.
Moreover, my clit was throbbing with a dull pain, and I could feel it get
pulled down, between my legs as I rolled. It thudded against the floor when I
got onto my back. The only analogy I could think of was running your nose into
a sliding glass door at full speed. Instead of your nose, though, it was my
clit. It was a solid hit, too.

I shot up and looked, too scared to actually touch it
or move, for fear of my doing anything hurting it even more. It just lied there
on the floor, a slightly more intense throbbing pain, now. Both my major and
minor labia were still missing. The hole in my belly, on the other hand, had
disappeared completely. There wasn't even a scar. I sat with my legs spread
out, to scared what may happen if they touched my enormous, now six inch long,
inch and a half wide clitoris I leaned back on my arms, staring at what had
become of my private parts. An image of my labials stretched like a rubber band
on the rod that was penetrating me flashed into my mind.

My vision blurred and I found myself weeping. I
pulled my knees up to hug, making sure to keep my feet apart so that my
engorged clit had room to be by itself and sobbed for a time. How long I can't
be sure. My sadness became anger. I began shouting at the walls and ceiling. I
asked why I was there, why whoever did this to me why they did. Where my
friends were. I demanded to be returned back to the my car. Back to Earth, if
we weren't there any more.

That though shut me up. My eyes watered as I wondered
what my captors would do to me. I remembered the sheer pain I felt earlier. I
was unaware such pain existed. I would rather die than undergo anatomy changing
torture for the rest of my days. Would it return to normal? Close to normal?
Did I depend on my captors to fix what they did? Should I even allow myself the
hope that they might be so inclined. Every movement hurt my clit, the throbbing
did not stop.

I wanted to look for an exit, and worried about how
to handle my clit while doing it, if at all. I eventually got the courage up to
try. I set my hands and feet firmly on the floor. I pushed myself up slightly.
My clit slid along the floor slightly and hung half way. The pain was terrible.
It felt like I was using an iron wool rag to try to pull it off. I slowly sat
back down, continuing my switching between cursing and crying for a while.

I decided to try it again eventually. This time I was
going to try to pick up my clit in a hand, so that the gravity did not make it
feel like it would rip off. I touched either side, to lift it, my thumb on one
side, forefinger on the other. It felt like I was lifting it with sandpaper,
and like I was ripping it as I lifted.� I
managed to get it in my left hand, which, too, felt like it was made of
sandpaper and scraped it with even minor motion. I held it and stood, though.
As my hand moved slightly, it felt as though it may be ripped off, too. It
stayed, though. I actually would have preferred otherwise, but I didn't think
to make the attempt myself. The pain would be too much. I was handling it, for
the time being.

I walked, very slowly, over to a wall. I felt the
wall with my free hand. It felt as smooth as the ground, almost like a fine
plastic. I looked around the room and realized it was hopeless, but I felt
along the wall anyway. I was crying again by my third circuit around the room,
which was probably half an hour to two hours later, I couldn't really tell. I
was about to try to lay down, when a seven foot circle in the center of the
floor appeared. It was simply a black circle that was suddenly there.

As I took my first step towards the circle, something
shot up out of it, to about three feet above the floor. It was a metallic X
cross, level with the ground. There was a girl on it with huge breasts. They
were the most obvious aspect of the girl they were so huge. She was strapped to
the cross, which didn't seem to touch anything or be supported by anything. As
soon as it had appeared, the circle was gone.

I walked over to investigate the bald, unconscious
girl. It was Sally. I inspected her, to see what damage our captors had done to
her, hoping it wasn't as severe as what happened to me. Of course there were
her breasts. They were huge. I couldn't begin to guess their size. Somehow,
they maintained perkiness. They were each as big as a large cantaloupe. Her nipples
were hard, and beautiful.

Yes,� thought
they were beautiful. I was not a lesbian, or even bisexual, but I somehow
thought her breasts were beautiful. I quickly checked her arms and head, neck,
shoulders back and the rest of her torso. Nothing was different. I was anxious
and wanted to wait until after her legs, but I couldn't resist. I looked at her
crotch. It was, so far as I could say having never seen it before, normal. Of
course, there was no hair. Our captors removed all of both of our hair. There was
a peculiar greenish yellow fluid dripping from both her anus and vagina,
though. Like what had come from mine after my belly was pierced.

I felt it. I was curious. I noticed how it was mildly
viscous, and allowed my fingers to slide around without much resistance at all.
It had no noticeable smell. I had a difficult time gripping her labia with it
on my hand. I needed to inspect inside, just to be sure they didn't do anything
there.

That's when I realized I was enjoying what I was
doing sexually, and far too powerfully. I tried to back away. I hesitated, but
took several steps back. I stared at her for moments, possibly minutes. She was
spread wide open. Her crotch stared back at me, begging me to play some more. I
had another realization. My clit no longer hurt. On looking, it seemed a tad
larger and less pensile. It was... it was becoming erect.

My hand felt good underneath it, slightly rubbing it.
In fact, it felt wonderful. It had become probably eight inches long, more than
two wide. I let go, and it bobbed, remaining horizontal. I looked back up to
Sally's lubricated pussy. I unconsciously rubbed my tits. I debated what to do
in my head, but not for nearly as long as I should have. I walked up to her,
right up to her pussy. I rubbed the tip of my clit against hers. It was heaven.
I didn't need any more convincing. I pressed my clit into her pussy. There was
little resistance, thanks to the lubricant. I slid right in. It was so wet and
tight, I could barely contain myself. In fact, I was moaning deep in my throat,
bestially almost. It was the single most wonderful feeling ever. I almost had
an orgasm before getting all the way in. I stopped, and looked at Sally's face.

She was awake. She was staring up at me, obviously
scared and confused.

I managed to growl out �Don't be scared. I have to do
this. I'm sorry, but I... I... I just have to.�

She had a band around her mouth as I did during the
alteration, so I didn't even know if she was trying to resist, really. However,
the terror on her face spelled it out. I didn't care, either. I had to do what
I was doing. I couldn't stop myself. I grabbed her huge, wonderful tits. She
shut her eyes and had a pain filled look on her face, but I played with her
tits, flicking her nipples, squeezing the huge bags of flesh, and pressing them
together. It looked like she was in agony, as though her tits felt as my clit
did earlier, but I couldn't stop playing with them.

I began pumping slowly in and out of her pussy. My
vision got hazy, and I lost control. As I slid in and out so slowly and
passionately, I squeezed her tits with all my power, moving my hands whenever I
changed direction, just to squeeze until I reversed course again.

When I was finally able to get into her all the way,
I felt an orgasming on. I pulled on her tits, then began slapping them as hard
as I could. I wasn't fully aware of what I was doing, it just happened. I began
thrusting into her violently as I slapped away at her tits with my orgasm. It
was easily more powerful than the one I had earlier, before passing out. As the
orgasm ended, I was pulling her nipples up and at me cruelly, pulling myself
into her with them. As the quivers from the orgasm subsided, I let go of her
nipples and looked at her face. Tears were falling from her eyes profusely. There
was a small puddle underneath her head on the floor.

It was getting darker, Sally was going higher, until
she was above me. �Sorry� I think I managed to whisper before unconsciousness
claimed me fully.

I awoke in basically the same state as last time. The pain from my clit
was dull, but sharp again when I moved. I opened my eyes and saw Sally. She was
no longer in the contraption that held her earlier. She was sitting on her
knees near the far wall, looking at her breasts. She was holding them both
softly. It looked as though she were trying not to move. She cringed each time
she breathed.

�I'm sorry.� I said trying to sit without allowing my
clit to fall onto the floor. I caught it in my hand before it hit the ground,
but it still felt terrible. I doubled over just as she replied to me. I was too
distracted to catch what she said, of course. I looked back up to her
questioningly.

�I know you well enough to know you wouldn't normally
do that, Mandy. They did something to you. You would never hurt me like that on
purpose.� She said softly, sniffing back the tears that would have caused her
chest to bounce if not checked.

Just then, a soft swooshing noise came from the wall
across from me, to the side of Sally. When I looked over that way, there was a
doorway. Beyond the doorway was a hall. The hall seemed to be made of the same
luminescent material as the room we were in. I looked back at Sally as she
looked back to me.

�They're herding us.� She said, in her odd calm voice
she had been using this whole time.

�What if they're releasing us?� I asked, and began to
stand. Slowly. it took effort to not move my clit roughly, though it hurt
regardless. Once up and steady, I walked over to Sally and held out my free arm
to help her get up steadily.

She began to stand without my help. I suppose she
still didn't trust me fully. I didn't, either. When she was standing, a few
tears trickled down one cheek, but her breathing remained mostly regular. She
had a look of mild pain on her face.

I edged towards the doorway and looked down the
hallway. The hallway extended something like one hundred feet, but I had never
been wonderful at guessing dimensions in this way. About halfway down the hall
was something dark along the wall. Perhaps a mural or window. There was
something just beyond it, on the same side of the wall, but I couldn't tell
from here. I looked at the doorway, and there didn't seem to be anything
trapped or misleading about it. I took one step through. I took the step a
little too hard, jolting my clit and forcing me to bend a bit, waiting for the
air to return to my lungs.

Once the pain died down to a dull throb again, I
slowly edged my way down the hall, wishing I could walk faster without hurting
myself. Sally was about five feet behind me. When I looked at her, she seemed
to have a more difficult time walking than I did, so I slowed down to keep
together.

It seemed to take forever, walking along the
unfurnished and undivided walls. We finally got to the dark part of the wall,
which was the entire hight of the right side of the hallway, and about ten feet
along it. I held my mouth agape� and
walked to the center of it when I noticed what it was. It was a window into a
dark bluish room. The room it looked into was a ten foot cube, the window being
one of the walls. It was full of a blue liquid. The most obvious and disturbing
thing in the room, the only thing, actually, was the collection in the center
of the room.

Sally gasped and swore softly, unable to be loud in
her shock. Without body, there were two arms and two legs. They were positioned
as though they were attached to a body. The arms were held out straight, the
legs being held wide, but in a natural and relaxed state. In where a neck would
be, by my guess, was some sort of flesh I couldn't identify. In between the
tops of the legs, though, there was a vulva. Both inner and outer labia, to be
more specific, there was not a whole vulva.

Sally was next to me, saying something. I couldn't
hear. I pressed my hands against the glass, trying to look for a door into the
room on one of it's walls. I almost did, anyhow. As my clit reached the bottom
of it's slight fall, I doubled over and hit my head against the glass. The pain
in my head was slight at best. My biggest concern was my tortured clit, which
felt about to tear off. I quickly grabbed it. Somehow I hadn't fallen to the
floor. I was leaning against the glass, pressing myself against it. Though my
hand still felt like sandpaper, the pain was fading.

I discovered I was crying when the pain had gone most
of the way. Sally was next to me, looking at me as though she wanted to hug me,
but my sobs would certainly torture her massive, succulent tits. 'No, I
shouldn't have thought that way.' I though told myself.

I wiped my face and began to step to the far side of
the window, where the something else was. I still cried, but it wasn't sobs,
and Sally placed her head against mine before my first step. When I walked away
from her, she looking in the room, I inspected the cubbyhole that was about
waist high and was the other thing I couldn't identify on the other side of the
dark part of the hallway. Dripping from near it's center was a greenish fluid.
I recognized it immediately, for it pooled out of a person's orifices.� Specifically, it was dripping from an anus
and the vagina that was below it.

It was as though this person's legs had been removed.
The person was lying on their stomach. They had no arms, either, as I continued
looking up. Their head was to the side, moving, trying to look back at me, but
the cubby was too thin to allow her to rotate enough to see. Her mouth was
moving, but no sound came out. The cubby was just wide and long enough to fit
the limbless girl, but it was about five feet tall, extending far above my
head.

My clit didn't hurt so badly, while I looked at that
beautiful, sexy ass. I realized then that this was Amanda. I felt stupid for it
to take so long. I felt a horrible feeling in the pit of my stomach. I was
going to throw up but I never began to retch, only coughed. My eyes were caught
on that ass, and the feeling in my stomach subsided. The pain in my clit was
fading quickly. The way it moved, trying to turn over, the torso hitting each
side of the cubby without much sound, as though it were padded. It was turning
and sliding like the ass of a beautiful stripper giving a lap dance.

I felt my clit getting hard again. I pried my eyes
away from it to look at Sally. I needed to be reminded what horrible thoughts
they were, going through my head. She seemed paralyzed, staring straight ahead
at the nightmarish display of human body parts. I looked at them, hoping their
gruesomeness would return me to my normal state of mind. I saw what I assumed
were my own labia, and my clit throbbed with pleasure. It was pretty, after
all.

'No!' I told myself, tearing my gaze away from the
form in the room. My gaze landed right on Amanda's ass again. My left hand, the
hand not holding my now erect clit, grabbed her left butt cheek. I was dazzled
by it. It was so soft, yet firm. It was so healthy and beautiful. I squeezed
slightly, pulling the cheek a bit to the side to gaze at her asshole. I hadn't
thought to, but the tip of my clit was suddenly aimed at her asshole as I
stepped closer.

I noticed my clit's size as I grabbed either side of
her ass and pulled her towards me as I pressed the first inch in. It was easily
eight inches long, two wide. I slowly slid it in, watching in glorious triumph
as each individual quarter inch slid in. The tightness was wonderful, the
thrashing of the torso and head only adding to the pleasure of it all.

Someone was next to me, saying something. I looked up
at them, pausing my progress into the ass I was violating, �... it's Amanda!
Please stop! You have to stop! This is rape, you're raping her! Friends would
not do someth...� SLAP!

It seemed like she was in the middle of a sentence,
but without even thinking about it I had slapped her. It was a hard back hand.
She flew to the side and down, her hands stopping her fall all the way to the
floor. My clit was no longer in Amanda's ass, which was slightly over the edge
of the cubby. I shouted something at the form of Sally as she turned into a
sitting position, grabbed her tits, and yelled. She was crying, trying to calm
herself down. Her tits shook in exaggerated detail, each wobble bringing more
pain to her face. She looked up at me and I stepped towards her. She looked
down, as though in apology, and I stopped my advance.

I turned back towards the gloriously tight ass I was
raping moments before. It was wiggling slowly from side to side, trying to
distribute it's weight such that it could get further into the cubby. I was
back at it, holding each side again, pulling it onto my clit. I entered her
asshole faster this time. I went slowly, but much faster than before, trying to
get back where I was last time. I paused in triumph on obtaining my former
depth in her ass. Her thrashing again served only to make me more excited.

Her thrashing felt good on my clit as well. However, I
had to forge ahead. Again I progressed slowly, enjoying it as fine wine. I
looked up at her face, trying to swing around to yell something at me, but no
noise came forth, aside loud breathing. The breathing sounded like panting. She
was enjoying it, she loved being fucked in the ass by force, or so I thought in
the state I was in. I had gotten just over six inches deep when I encountered
resistance. At that moment, she stiffened. Her torso thrust forward, as though
trying to get her ass away from me. Too bad I was holding it. She could do
nothing to escape.

I glanced over at Sally. She was watching the whole
thing happen, crying silently. The way she held her huge tits made it seem like
she was trying to turn me on. I had begun slowly fucking Amanda's ass. I was
moving over an inch in and out, each time going out a tad further and back in
until her torso twitched at the point of resistance. For every inch I pulled
out, I had gotten another quarter inch deeper on my thrusts. Her head was to
the side a bit, bowed, clutching crying eyes shut.

I began using most of the length, pounding her ass,
watching for it to get all the way in. Once it had gotten all the way in, it
felt truly wonderful. I shouted in my excitement. I didn't comprehend what I
shouted, if there was anything to comprehend about it. Soon, I was nearing
orgasm. I picked her up at her mid torso and picked her up. I held her close to
my chest in a bear hug and pulled her up and down against my thrusts. I wound
up on my knees, slamming my clit into her ass with as much force as I could
muster. The sound of her ass against my crotch made wet slapping noises, and I
was vaguely aware of my thighs hurting.

Then I had the most powerful orgasm I ever had. I
continued slamming her throughout my orgasm. After I was done, while I was
quivering uncontrollably, it started getting dark again. I became conscious of
what I had just done. Be fore I could set Amanda down softly and hope to save
her any more unneeded pain, before my clit had even began moving out of her
ass, I was falling.
