My Temporary Wife 
&quot;Were you able to book yourself on the holiday Jack?&quot; Daphne asked. 
&quot;Unfortunately not. Had an email back from the Airdnaglochen Hotel saying
  they were fully booked. Pity. I would have liked to have gone away for a few
  days especially as it coincided with the week &quot;The Wagoners&quot; is closed
  for refurbishment and we can't have this room. I guess all you hymn singing,
  tambourine banging sisters booked the place up,&quot; I answered. 
&quot;Well with spouses and friends there are twenty of us from the church
  choir going but the hotel holds about a hundred so it's not just us taking
  all the places. Do you think this blue is okay Jack?&quot; 
I looked at the blue she'd mixed for the woman's dress and suggested she lighten
  it a bit. It was Emily's turn to model this week and she refused to undress
  although she didn't object when others in the group did. Perhaps I should explain.
  I'm Jack Irvine and I'm an unpaid teacher for a small village
  art group, which meets in the backroom of our local pub, &quot;The Wagoners&quot;,
  once a week. I specialise in figure drawing and painting, especially nude figures,
  but I also do portraits, these make up the bulk of my commissions, and I do
  some landscapes for my 'bread and butter' income. Realistic art is my life.
  I've no time for 'abstract' art rubbish. We've twelve in our group and mostly
  ten turn up each week. Only four of the group, excluding me, are men. When
  the group asked me to teach them to do figure work, we instituted a system
  of pulling a name out of a hat to get that person to model for us for the afternoon.
  Although most of them would now pose in the nude, Emily, an elderly lady, was
  one of those who would not. We don't force anyone to pose naked but they have
  to put up with a lot of good-natured banter if they don't. However, we had
  to concede that Emily didn't really have the figure for it but her wizened
  features were excellent for portraiture. If you want more personal details
  of me, then I'm 65, unmarried, about six feet tall and fairly well built and
  still fit and active. I consider myself a jovial, raunchy artist and seem to
  get on well with the art group. I've bedded a couple of them and a number other
  girls that have modelled for me or wanted their portraits painted. 
&quot;Would you like me to ask Gillian to see if there are any cancellations
  from our group?&quot; Daphne asked. Gillian Kidman organised the trip for the
  choir. &quot;That is if you don't mind being part of a staid old group of hymn
  singing church biddies,&quot; Daphne laughed and so did I. She knew I never
  had much time for churchie things although I displayed my work in the church
  hall at their annual shows. 
&quot;You mean there will be some older than you?&quot; I joked, knowing she
  was in her early forties. Even since the party to celebrate her fortieth birthday
  we'd kidded her about being over the hill. 
&quot;Jean Shepherd's coming with me but I guess we'll be the youngest in
  the group. They're more your age really. Dinosaurs.&quot; 
I'd more or less forgotten about the trip until a few days before departure
  when Daphne phoned me. &quot;You still interested in going to Scotland with
  us old biddies Jack? I know it's short notice.&quot; I said I was. &quot;Well
  there is a placeï¿½&quot; There was a pause. 
&quot;But?&quot; I cut in sensing there was going to be a catch. 
&quot;But you'll have to share a room with a woman whose husband died three
  months ago.&quot; 
&quot;Is she young and blonde and willing?&quot; I joked. 
&quot;No, none of those things that I know of. Possibly willing otherwise
  she would not have agreed to let you stay with her. She's a bit younger than
  you are and grey haired but no blue rinse. She's happy-go-lucky, down to earth
  and laughs a lot. Likes practical jokes. Her husband, Herbert, had a heart
  attack three months ago. She's fairly short, about 5' 2&quot; and a little
  plump. Outgoing. Likes singing in the choir but isn't overly religious. She
  knows you or at least of you because she's seen you at shows and when you gave
  that talk to the Women's Institute. That's as good a CV as I can give you.
  You've no doubt seen her around but may not know her.&quot; 
I remembered that talk particularly as there were two self-righteous old ladies
  who complained in no uncertain terms that the work I did was pornographic and
  left before the end. From the description so far, I guessed she wasn't one
  of those. &quot;As you haven't told me the woman's name yet Daff, I won't know.&quot; 
&quot;Sorry Jack. It's Madeleine Jenkins but we all know her as 'Madge'. She's
  a ball of fun and when she gets going, she has the choir in hysterics, or most
  of them. There are a couple of your old biddies that don't seem to be able
  to crack their lips. They'll be on the coach trip too.&quot; Daphne paused
  while I tried to think of a reply and then she went on, &quot;There's a plus
  as well. She doesn't want any payment except you can buy her a drink from the
  bar in the evenings. Her husband paid up front so the money has sort of been
  used and gone and she's not badly off.&quot; 
&quot;Can I contact her and have a chat?&quot; 
&quot;Sorry, she's staying with her sister for the next couple of days. Her
  sister has caught this bug that's going around and is a bit poorly, otherwise
  she would have gone with Madge. She said for you to just turn up at the coach
  stop outside &quot;The Wagoners&quot; if you wanted to come. I'm sure you'll
  like her Jack and really what have you got to lose? Not your virginity, that's
  for sure,&quot; she giggled. &quot;The room will probably have twin beds and
  you're both over the age of consent by a few years.&quot; 
We joked a bit more about what Madge and I might get up to before I finally
  agreed to go. 
&quot;Ah here comes my temporary husband to take me on my honeymoon!&quot; A
  smiling woman, looking more than a little plump with the thick coat she was
  wearing, detached herself from the knot of people waiting outside the pub and
  came to greet me with open arms. 
I put my cases down and gave her a big hug and when I felt her hug me too,
  I gave her a real lips-to-lips kiss. &quot;Morning, temporary wife,&quot; I
  responded. 
&quot;Oooh! I like that sort of greeting,&quot; she giggled and kept her arms
  around me. 
Daphne came over. &quot;I knew you two would get on. Just remember who it
  was that arranged this marriage for you Jack. I may want some personal tuition
  in return.&quot; We often had the sort of conversation where there were double
  meanings and innuendoes but we were only ever good friends. 
&quot;You keep your hands off him Daphne Watkins. He's mine for the week.&quot; Madge
  gave me another hug. 
&quot;Don't be greedy, Madge,&quot; Daphne chortled and then looked round. &quot;Better
  be careful though. Looks as though some disapprove.&quot; Standing close to
  us were the two old ladies who I remembered leaving the W.I. meeting. 
One of them, I later learned she was Miss Vera Leavey, the 72 year old church
  organist and a sour, self righteous, religious bigot, looked at us and spoke
  to Madge. &quot;You ought to be ashamed of yourself, a woman of your age throwing
  yourself at him like that. Your husband's not been in his grave three months
  and yet you're acting like a teenage slut. And you know what sort of an artist
  he is. He does the most disgusting work.&quot; 
&quot;Jealousy will get you nowhere Vera dear,&quot; Madge laughed infectiously
  and Daphne and I joined in. Many of the others grinned too causing Vera to
  scowl and mutter something to Mrs. Heather Beadman, her friend and travelling
  companion. Madge then introduced me to close friends of hers, Gwen Jones and
  her partner Len. &quot;Gwen was the one who convinced me to offer my late husband's
  place to you. Her and Len have been living in sin, as our supposedly devout
  members would say, for about five years so they can't say too much about me
  spending a week with you.&quot; The couple seemed friendly enough but didn't
  say a great deal. For a few moments it looked as if Vera was going to interrupt
  us again but fortunately at this point the coach arrived and there was the
  usual scramble to get the luggage stowed, tickets checked and outer coats removed
  and into the overhead lockers. The coach was already half full with passengers
  from town but, because of the large number of people from the village, the
  coach detoured from its main route to pick us up. 
Seat allocation was by ticket numbers and by some quirk of fate, we found
  ourselves directly behind Vera and Heather. Madge grinned impishly as she took
  the widow seat. &quot;See if there is a blanket we can put over our laps Jack,&quot; she
  said loudly enough for the two in the front to hear. They turned to each other
  and almost in unison they both turned and gave us such a look of disdain. 
&quot;You are an eager one, Madge,&quot; I replied. I'm sure I was grinning
  ear to ear. &quot;Still it is very cold even for early March and we might want
  somewhere to keep our hands warm.&quot; The couple sitting behind us looked
  amused. They were from town and we didn't know them. However, with the heating
  in the coach, there was no need for the blanket. 
Daphne sat a few rows behind us on the other side of the coach. We'd been
  going about half an hour and the coach was speeding along the main road when
  she came to us. &quot;You two newlyweds okay?&quot; she asked. We'd been chatting
  away as if we'd known each other for ages. We spoke for a few minutes and when
  she left Daphne warned me, &quot;You take care Jack. She'll have your trousers
  off in no time at all.&quot; 
&quot;That's what I'm hoping for,&quot; I joked. 
Vera turned round and in a loud, strident and icy voice that was heard throughout
  the coach, said, &quot;You really are a disgusting pair. You should never have
  been allowed to join a party of good, God-fearing people. Aren't you ashamed
  of yourself Madeleine? &quot;What would your Herbert say if he could see you
  now?&quot; 
Daphne rolled her eyes and tried to keep a straight face; Madge grinned; the
  couple behind smiled still not knowing the situation between us but beginning
  to get an inkling of what was going on and I guessed the rest of the coach
  party was too. &quot;I guess he would say, 'don't let yourself become a crotchety
  old spinster.&quot; Madge answered and I added, &quot;And please don't talk
  to my new wife in that tone of voice.&quot; Vera immediately turned and stared
  fixedly out of the front window. 
For the next couple of hours, Madge and I talked about our lives and then
  got on to the subject of my work and my drawing of nude women. &quot;Do you
  take them to bed afterwards?&quot; Madge asked in a loud whisper. Heather and
  Vera again shot glances at each other but didn't turn round this time. 
&quot;Only occasionally. Professional models are just that. They pose, you
  pay them and they leave. Some of the amateur ones like to go further but not
  those in our group, I hasten to add.&quot; I conveniently forgot about the
  two I had bedded. &quot;Most will pose naked for us and will sit still while
  we draw them. There's a sort of unwritten rule that you can look as closely
  as you wish but no touching.&quot; 
&quot;So you've seen Daphne and the others starkers?&quot; 
&quot;Yes, and drawn them.&quot; 
&quot;And the men?&quot; I nodded, &quot;What if they becomeï¿½excited when
  they're posing Jack?&quot; 
&quot;I usually say, 'draw what you see' but most often the group will wait
  until the erection goes down or discretely draw a strip of cloth over it or
  imagine it in repose. It happens to some of the men when they are drawing a
  woman, but everyone tries to ignore any bulges in the trousers of the men.
  It's a natural phenomena so why make a fuss over it?&quot; 
After a couple of hours we stopped at a service station to get a cuppa and
  have a pee break. I bought Madge a coffee and while I sat at the table waiting
  for her to return from the loo, Daphne and Jean joined me. &quot;Vera and Heather
  are having another go at Madge,&quot; Jean told me, &quot;But she's giving
  them as good as she gets. She hasn't been this happy for a long while.&quot; She
  then tried to look serious and reprimanded me. &quot;It's shameful the way
  you teased and embarrassed those poor innocent old ladies. You ought to be
  ashamed of yourself Jack,&quot; but at that point she couldn't keep a straight
  face. 
&quot;Perhaps you ought to be a little more discrete Jack. I think the pair
  of you were putting it on to mortify them as much as you could,&quot; Daphne
  chided me more seriously. 
&quot;You don't think I should ask them to pose for the art group then Daff?&quot; The
  three of us were laughing at the thought when Madge returned. 
&quot;They've protested to Gillian that she oughtn't to have allowed you on
  the coach. Gillian of course didn't know of the arrangement until you turned
  up this morning but said that it was better to fill the seat and for me to
  have some company rather than to go away on my own for the first time in years.
  She thought my sister was coming with me as that's what I told her earlier
  in the month,&quot; Madge informed us. &quot;That didn't satisfy them too much
  so now they've threatened to take the matter to Roger, our vicar, and have
  him throw me out of the choir. I doubt there's much chance of that. Roger is
  no great lover of them either.&quot; 
Our conversation lapsed when we were on the motorway again so I fetched out
  a sketchbook and pencils and started drawing her. Of course she wanted to see
  the other sketches in my book first but I only showed her the ones of Emily
  and said she could see the nude ones in private later. Following my usual practice
  I did half a dozen quick sketches to get the feel of the subject and, in this
  case, the feel of drawing on a bus. When I was satisfied I did a detailed portrait
  which turned out extremely well. Madge asked if she could have it and I said,
  later because I wanted to put some watercolour tints on it. John and Gladys
  the couple sitting behind us, and two ladies across the aisle, openly watched
  as I worked and remarked how good the likeness was. 
&quot;Not bad for a beginner,&quot; Daphne remarked when she came to see the
  result and then asked to show it to Jean. I heard them giggling after a bit
  and when I looked round I saw she was showing some of my earlier drawings to
  her. I knew some of them were unclothed ones of Daphne. She was being careful
  that others didn't see them so I wasn't too upset. &quot;Will you do Jean?&quot; she
  asked when she returned the book. 
&quot;Anytime she's willing,&quot; I joked and both Madge and Daphne aimed
  mock punches at me. 
&quot;You know what I meant Jack.&quot; Speaking to Madge she went on, &quot;Jean
  won't be taking your new husband away. She's not into very old men!&quot; I
  shook my fist at her. &quot;Well I did get you on this trip so you can do it
  as a favour to me.&quot; 
Madge wanted to show Gwen first and it seemed that half the bus saw it as
  well, always explaining that her 'new husband' did it and most of them quickly
  cottoned on to the situation. When the book finally came back to me Daphne
  and I exchanged seats and I spent a pleasant half-hour or so sketching and
  producing a final drawing of Jean. I'd met her on a number of occasions and
  always liked her. &quot;Would you like a portrait like I did of Madge or a
  posed picture like those of Daphne?&quot; I asked before I started. 
&quot;I guess it will have to be the portrait Jack. I don't think this is
  the sort of studio you need for a nudie picture.&quot; She knew I was teasing. 
&quot;Perhaps another time then.&quot; To get the lighting better I arranged
  for her to sit on the aisle seat and to look slightly to one side of me. It
  was now very warm on the coach and she'd removed her cardigan. &quot;Would
  you mind if I undo the top button of your blouse?&quot; I asked, &quot;It will
  make you look alive and very desirable.&quot; 
&quot;You mean sexy!&quot; 
&quot;Yep!&quot; I did it and in the final drawing I showed just the top bit
  of her bra, which I changed to one with lace trim, and she appeared to be looking
  wistfully out into space and thinking of her lover. 
&quot;Wow!&quot; she cried out causing others around to look in her direction, &quot;That
  really makes me look as if I'm seducing a man. You really are as good as Daff
  makes out. Did I actually have that expression on my face?&quot; I left her
  to guess the answer to that. She took the pad and showed Daphne and Madge and
  then went along the bus showing it to some of her other friends in the choir.
  I think it earned me some brownie points amongst most of them but only served
  to heighten the animosity of the two old hens because they saw it when Jean
  held it up for a couple ahead of them to see it. 
&quot;Will you do a sexy one of me later?&quot; Madge asked. 
&quot;Of course. Not just sexy but erotic.&quot; 
When we arrived at Gretna Green, Daphne suggested that we should stop the
  coach there and put Madge and me over the anvil and get the blacksmith make
  an honest man and woman of us. It was raining and the driver grinned when Daphne
  asked and pointed out that parking was a problem. By now the whole bus knew
  of the situation between Madge and myself so we didn't have to hide it. It
  had become a stock joke. &quot;Saved by the rain and the parking problem!&quot; I
  laughed. 
For much of the last few hours of the journey on narrow roads, the traffic
  was heavy so we arrived late but the hotel kept dinner for us. &quot;We'll
  give you your room keys as quickly as we can so you can freshen up and then
  please make your way into the dining room. I'll do the welcome and orientation
  bit in the lounge afterwards,&quot; the manageress informed us. I suppose I
  shouldn't have been surprised but I guess the rooms were allocated on the same
  system as the coach seats. Our room was next to the two old biddies. I did
  notice as we passed their door, that they had twin beds while we had a double.
  I remarked on it to Madge and she said, &quot;Herbie ordered a room with a
  double bed because we always slept together. When Daphne suggested I might
  share with you, I thought I could get it changed for a twin but now I've met
  you, I decided not to bother the staff. Unless you want a bed on your own?&quot; 
&quot;What and miss sleeping with my innocent bride?&quot; 
My suggestion to Madge that we have an early night quickly brought her agreement
  but also many ribald comments from those near to us. Our two biddies glowered
  at us when I took Madge's hand and led her to the lift. &quot;Goodnight Heather.
  Goodnight Vera,&quot; I called out as we passed them. 
&quot;I feel almost as nervous now as I did with my first night with Herbie.
  I wasn't a virgin or anything but I'd never spent the whole night with him
  in a bed. Now it's a similar feeling. In front of the others I could brazen
  it out and pretend. It's crunch time now. It's not that I don't want toï¿½I suppose
  I'm just a little afraid.&quot; 
I put my arms around her. &quot;Madge, if you don't want to do it, that's
  okay&quot;ï¿½&quot;I do,&quot; she butted in. &quot;Well then would you rather
  we undressed in separate rooms? I could go into the bathroom. Or would you
  prefer we undressed each other?&quot; 
&quot;Let's do it a bit at a time. That's what Herbie and I did on our wedding
  night.&quot; So that's what we did and then we stood back and looked at each
  other. Madge was a little plump but not overly fat. Her tits had started to
  sag but were still nice and I could tell she never trimmed her pubic hair.
  Probably she never wore a bathing costume to worry about things like that.
  I wondered what she thought of me as I stood there with my prick rising but
  she made no comment so I went and hugged and kissed her for a few minutes. &quot;You
  make me feel like a schoolgirl again,&quot; she whispered, &quot;Let's get
  under the bedclothes. It's none too warm in here with nothing on. You'll take
  it easy won't you Jack. It's been a while sinceï¿½&quot; 
&quot;Of course,&quot; I replied kissing her again, &quot;And I did bring
  some gel in case we needed it. I've never had an old age pensioner before.&quot; 
&quot;It will be a treat after those skinny models of yours,&quot; she laughed. 
We'd just snuggled down in the bed and I was fondling her tits and crotch
  when we heard our neighbour's door bang and Vera's high pitched voice came
  through the wall. We couldn't make out what she was saying but we could certainly
  hear her. &quot;Jesus, they do make the walls thin in these modern hotels,&quot; I
  whispered to Madge. I guess too that it was partly the design of the place.
  Entering our room, the toilet, shower and wardrobe were on the left and the
  bed against the right hand wall. From the earlier glimpse we had, I knew their
  room was a mirror image of ours. Their bedheads were against the same wall
  as ours. 
We took no more notice of the voices and I concentrated on getting Madge's
  juices flowing so we didn't need the gel. I hated using it because initially
  it always felt cold. She surprised me by rapidly becoming wet. Slowly I entered
  my prick but with her encouragement began to fuck normally. We soon found that
  the bed had been used for this purpose on many occasions. The springs creaked
  noisily and the whole frame rocked slightly, just enough for the wooden bedhead
  to tap against the wall. A gentle 'tap, tap, tap, with every thrust. &quot;They'll
  hear that next door,&quot; I remarked. 
&quot;Let them. Don't you dare stop now. Heather at least will know what we're
  up to and perhaps wish she'd brought her husband instead of Vera.&quot; I didn't
  stop, but for a while the voices did. Then Vera's voice started speaking again
  and we giggled, realising they not only could hear us, but also had worked
  out what we were doing. One of the advantages of having sex when you get older
  is that it takes much longer to ejaculate. So it was that our bed kept tapping
  the wall for perhaps twenty minutes. I worked up a good sweat and so did Madge
  but she, like me, was obviously enjoying the experience and our minds blotted
  out the fact that others would know what we were up to. Neither of us cared
  anyway and perhaps we were being a bit exhibitionistic. 
When I finally came and we rested for a bit, Madge said mischievously, &quot;Let's
  rock the bed while we cuddle.&quot; 
&quot;Oh you are a naughty girl,&quot; I laughed, &quot;A real practical joker.&quot; 
&quot;You'd have suggested it if you'd have thought of it first!&quot; 
She was right of course so I kissed her. By deliberately causing the bed to
  tap the wall, it hit the plaster much harder and sounded very loud. We kept
  it up for about ten minutes before we gave up and snuggled close to each other. 
As usual I woke early and had to go to the loo, which woke Madge. &quot;Would
  you like tea or coffee?&quot; I asked when I put the kettle on. The sun was
  just getting up so I opened the curtains a little. &quot;That's it!&quot; I
  almost shouted, &quot;I said I'd do an erotic picture of you and I can see
  the pose I want. Taking Madge's cup, I arranged the bedclothes to suit my idea
  and started sketching. Normally I don't get an erection when drawing nude women,
  but perhaps because this time I was naked as well, or perhaps because I knew
  Madge was available, this morning my prick rose to it's full glory. I disregarded
  it until I had the sketch finished to my satisfaction. For the moment I didn't
  show it to her but climbed into the bed and dragged Madge close to me. Seeing
  my erection must have made her horny too because she was already wet and soon
  the bedhead was tapping the plaster once more. We both laughed when we heard
  Vera's voice and this time she sounded really angry. 
&quot;Did you sleep well,&quot; Jean enquired at breakfast. 
&quot;Not too bad once this one had exhausted my energies,&quot; I was grinning
  at her knowing the two old hens were within earshot. 
&quot;You're not blaming me,&quot; Madge chided, &quot;I couldn't push you
  off.&quot; 
&quot;So you had a good night,&quot; Daphne came in on the conversation. 
&quot;Very nice. Just like a real honeymoon,&quot; answered Madge. 
We heard some noises behind us. &quot;Yes and you kept the whole hotel awake
  to the early hours. You disgusting pair.&quot; Vera's voice floated over the
  whole room. 
&quot;Sorry Vera. Did we disturb you?&quot; I tried to sound innocent. 
&quot;You know you did! Its small wonder that bed didn't fall apart or knock
  the wall down.&quot; 
&quot;Sorry. I'll see if we can move the bed away from the wall tonight. You
  need your beauty sleep and all that.&quot; Vera snorted and turned back to
  her breakfast. We heard her telling the others on her table, more quietly than
  before, &quot;They did it until after midnight and then again about seven this
  morning. It's disgraceful.&quot; 
&quot;He did the rudest picture of me,&quot; Madge whispered to Daphne and
  passed her my sketchbook. &quot;He said yesterday he'd do an erotic one and
  he has.&quot; 
&quot;You're right there,&quot; Daphne found the page and showed Jean. &quot;That's
  erotic art at its best. You're learning well Jack. One day you might be a good
  artist! If you live long enough after all your nights of debauchery.&quot; The
  others on the table laughed loudly. 
The picture showed Madge sitting up in bed, one breast fully uncovered and
  the other partially. The bedclothes on her partner's side were turned back
  and one hand looked to be patting the empty space. But it was the expression
  on her face that immediately captured people's eyes. They would almost hear
  her saying, &quot;Hurry up and come into bed.&quot; John looked over Len's
  shoulder when the book had been passed to him and he took it and in turn it
  did the rounds of the tables. Madge looked proud and was not in the least embarrassed
  by the attention or by her semi-nakedness. &quot;I may be knocking on a bit
  in years but I can still enjoy a bit of fun in bed,&quot; she declared. &quot;In
  any case this is my second honeymoon,&quot; she added. 
Vera of course, declared it pornographic and it almost demanded that it should
  be burned. &quot;Madeleine looks like a cheap slut begging forï¿½ She must have
  looked like that for you to have drawn it.&quot; She then repeated her belief
  that Madge should be thrown out of the church choir and threatened to resign
  as organist if she wasn't. 
&quot;How do know I didn't make it up? How do you know I didn't fake the expression?
  How do you know I didn't imagine the whole scene? How do you know that Madge
  wasn't asleep with the covers pulled up over her head when I did the drawing?&quot; I
  countered. 
&quot;You couldn't make up a look like that just out of your head or make
  it so realistic without actually copying her. No one could.&quot; Vera was
  emphatic in her views and went on to express them volubly. I caught a look
  from Daphne. She knew I wouldn't let a challenge like that go. 
A coach trip was organised for the day but a number of our party declined
  to go. It had been a long wearisome journey from our village and I didn't feel
  like sitting for another day even though the coaches were very comfortable.
  Madge, Daphne and Jean didn't either, so we spent the morning rambling by the
  loch side. The morning was bright but with a cold wind so I just took my pad
  and did some quick sketches that served as the basis for a painting later.
  Daphne did some sketches too and the pair of us spent the afternoon in the
  'activities room' working them up into a proper painting. Jean and Madge walked
  to the village so Daphne and I had the room almost to ourselves and could get
  on without interruption. 
I like to work with acrylics and by the end of the afternoon, I'd produced
  a painting of the loch with superimposed a rear view of Madge looking at the
  scene and holding her hat. Daphne did a watercolour of a similar scene. We
  commented on each others work, just like it was one of our meetings at the
  pub and then she asked, &quot;How much of Madge in bed did you make up, Jack?&quot; 
&quot;Not too much. I posed her. I guess what you are really asking is what
  will I do about our Vera's belief that I couldn't have made it up. That I don't
  know yet but I'll think of something.&quot; 
In the lounge that evening, I sat in a corner seat with the rest of 'our group';
  Madge, Daphne, Jean, Gwen and Len, chatting away. Or at least they were chatting;
  I had my pad and pencils. Beyond Daphne, 'Vera's group' sat at a table playing
  cribbage. The room was fairly crowded with other groups sitting around, mainly
  talking and drinking. I think Daphne thought I was sketching her because she
  put her tongue out but actually my sight was fixed on the scene beyond. Madge
  kept trying to sneak a look at what I was doing but I kept the pad turned away
  from her. Daphne came over when I'd put my pencil down, expecting a portrait
  of her and knowing my propensity for doing caricatures thought I might have
  done a cartoon. &quot;What have you done to me this time Jack?&quot; she laughed. 
&quot;It's not you Daff. It's my answer to this morning's challenge. I'm not
  sure that I want you to see it though because it might upset some people.&quot; This
  of course made her, and by then the others around us, all the more determined
  to see what I had drawn. After a little mock pretence of keeping the book from
  her I allowed her to snatch it from my hand. 
&quot;Jesus Christ Jack, you'll get crucified for this. It won't be a carved
  figure on the cross this Easter, it'll be you. I know she challenged your competence
  butï¿½Jesus.&quot; From her words and the tone of her voice we now had the attention
  of more than our own group. 
Madge took the book and stared at the drawing. &quot;And I can guess who'll
  drive the nails in,&quot; she grinned. 
The picture showed Vera playing cards but it wasn't quite the Vera we saw
  in front of us and it wasn't cribbage they were playing. I'd titled it, 'Strip
  Poker'. Vera sat bare chested, breasts sagging at the table, her look concentrating
  on the cards in her hand. Her flowery blouse and bra were on the table. Instead
  of a long dark skirt, I'd shortened it and put a slit up the side to reveal
  a considerable length of thigh. Vera looked like an old wanton trollop, gambling
  her clothes without any regard for her modesty. However, the facial features
  were easily recognisable as Vera's. 
&quot;You daren't show her Jack!&quot; Madge exclaimed. Gwen and Len took
  the book. By now the other groups were becoming curious as to what was happening
  although the card players were ignoring it. John and Gladys took the book to
  their group, which brought an outburst of raucous laughter. 
Vera soon realised something was up. Everyone was looking at her and either
  laughing out loud or smirking and trying to conceal their amusement. &quot;What
  have you done now?&quot; she demanded but for a while no one would let her
  see. Eventually she managed to get hold of it and for a moment there was a
  stunned silence. Tears sprang from her eyes as she ripped the page to shreds
  and ran from the room. I felt about an inch tall. The joke had misfired very
  badly. 
As a group we discussed what I could do to make amends but nobody came up
  with a worthwhile suggestion. An apology didn't seem adequate and in any case
  for the next three days she avoided being anywhere near me. Madge and I continued
  to enjoy each other and I did move the bed away from the wall so the noise
  wouldn't disturb our neighbours. Even when we did all go on one of the coach
  excursions, Vera and Heather studiously faced the front and never looked at
  either Madge or me. 
On the afternoon of the third day I saw Vera leave the hotel alone and walk
  along the path that led towards the shore of the loch. I caught up with her
  sitting on a bench looking miserable. Before she knew I was there, I sat alongside
  her and prevented her from getting up. &quot;Miss Leavey,&quot; I started.
  Vera tried to turn away. &quot;Miss Leavey, I know you don't think much of
  me but at least you can hear my apology. I've racked my mind as to what else
  I could do to make amends but I'm sure nothing I can say or do will make much
  difference. However, I do apologise. I went much too far in my efforts to take
  up your challenge and in doing so I have spoilt your holiday and upset some
  of your friends. I'm very sorry. I just wish there was something I could do
  to make amends.&quot; 
&quot;Of course there is nothing that you or that whore you're sleeping with
  can do. You made me look like a slut and made me the butt of everyone's jokes.
  What can you do to alter that?&quot; She spat the words as me with considerable
  venom. &quot;You deserve a good thrashing for what you did. Now let me go.
  I don't want anyone to think I am as perverted as you.&quot; 
&quot;Would thrashing me help you get over this?&quot; I asked. 
&quot;Probably not although it might help. Now let me go back.&quot; 
&quot;Okay,&quot; I said and stood up but still not letting her pass. Slipping
  my belt from the loops of my trousers I gave it to her. &quot;I'm going to
  lay myself over the fallen tree that's around the corner. If you want your
  revenge, bring the belt and use on my bottom. If not, leave it on this seat
  and go back to the hotel. I'll wait five minutes. It's hidden from view so
  no one will see us and you can do your worst.&quot; I remembered back to my
  schooldays and being made to bend over the headmaster's desk to receive a caning.
  I wasn't the most studious of boys and my drawings got me into trouble on more
  than one occasion even then. 
&quot;You're not serious?&quot; I assured her that I was and went to the log.
  For what seemed ages I just lay there, listening for any sound that might indicate
  she was coming or even to hear her go back to the hotel. A twig snapped and
  I knew she was close by. I really wondered what I was letting myself in for.
  I'd been two-thirds sure she would go back but I was wrong. Closing my eyes
  I waited, imagining what she would do. Perhaps she was thinking of her schooldays
  too. Her first move really surprised me. Reaching round and without a word
  she undid my fly button and pulled my trousers and pants down just far enough
  to bare my arse. This was not what I expected. It was going to be worse, much
  worse. 
&quot;SPLAT!!&quot; The pain as the belt landed was far more intense than
  I thought possible. The old lady had more strength than I believed. Gripping
  a small branch and keeping my mouth tightly closed I tried to avoid crying
  out. &quot; SPLAT!! SPLAT!! SPLAT!! SPLAT!! SPLAT!! SPLAT!!&quot; Vera laid
  the belt on my bum hard and furiously. She was certainly intent on revenge. &quot; SPLAT!!
  SPLAT!! SPLAT!! SPLAT!! SPLAT!!&quot; I couldn't help but cry out with the
  pain but I held on to the branch and kept my position. I didn't want her smirking
  and telling everyone that I couldn't take it. &quot;SPLAT!! SPLAT!! SPLAT!!
  SPLAT!!&quot; Was it ever going to end? I'd almost decided to give in when
  I heard Madge's voice, &quot;That's enough now Vera. You've had your revenge.&quot; 
Vera threw one last hit and tossed the belt to the ground. I winced and turned
  thinking she had left but she just stood there looking horrified at what she
  had done. &quot;Sorry, sorry,&quot; she muttered, &quot;I went too far.&quot; 
&quot;That makes two of us.&quot; I tried to smile through my pain as Madge
  helped me to my feet and pulled up my pants and trousers. Vera must have seen
  my prick but she didn't react in any way. Fortunately the pain of the thrashing
  was too great for me to get an erection. Holding Madge's hand, I walked slowly
  and stiffly back to our room. Vera hurried on ahead. 
&quot;I should have stopped it earlier,&quot; Madge said when she helped me
  into the shower. &quot;I should have but I thought it best to let Vera get
  it out of her system but in the end she didn't look as though she was aware
  of where she was or what she was doing.&quot; 
&quot;You saw it all?&quot; I questioned. 
&quot;I saw you leave after Vera. I wanted to make sure you wouldn't do anything
  to her but it was the other way round. I thought a bit of a spanking might
  warm you up ready for me when I heard your offer to her but didn't think she
  would go that far. Once she started I didn't want you to feel I'd stepped in
  too early. My God, your arse is going to be colourful for a day or two ï¿½ or
  a month or two.&quot; She looked at me and grinned, &quot;Those muscles will
  become stiff if you don't get someone to massage them.&quot; 
&quot;Shall I ask Vera to do that?&quot; I tried to joke but the pain was
  still pretty bad. 
Madge lightly smacked me, &quot;Yes, if you want a hiding from me to go with
  it.&quot; 
A little before dinner, we left our room at the same time as Vera and Heather.
  Seeing us, Vera stopped intending we should go first but I went to her. &quot;We're
  quits now Vera. The feud is over and for everyone's sake that is on this holiday,
  let's not start it up again. If we go into the hall together, everyone will
  know that it is over or at least we will have agreed a truce. Share the lift
  with us please.&quot; Vera didn't answer but kept fairly closely behind us
  as I hobbled along. 
Daphne and the others wanted to know why I wasn't walking properly and why
  I winced when I sat. I told them just loudly enough for Vera's table to hear, &quot;I
  slipped down by the loch and landed rather hard.&quot; Daphne showed her disbelief
  but I told her privately that it was the only explanation she was getting. 
&quot;What if we make you the model at the next meeting?&quot; I knew she
  was fishing for an answer. 
&quot;I will reserve my right to wear clothing.&quot; 
In bed that night, I knew and Madge knew, that I wouldn't be able to perform.
  I had an erection but my arse muscles didn't like moving, even after a Madge
  massage. &quot;Would you like me to suck it for you?&quot; she asked, &quot;Herbie
  liked me to do it especially in the days when I still had periods.&quot; 
&quot;Only if I can do it to you at the same time.&quot; That surprised her.
  For Herbie, it was a one way thing but she certainly seemed to enjoy my ministrations
  as much as I did hers. 
For the rest of the holiday, Vera only spoke to us when it was necessary to
  do so but neither did she berate us to others. For our part, Madge and I tried
  not to make sexual innuendoes when she was nearby and we made sure the bedhead
  never touched the wall. I couldn't do too much the day following my belting
  so I pottered in the activities room slapping some paint on hardboard panels
  without producing what I considered a worthwhile picture although I sold one
  to a holidaymaker from Liverpool. I suggested to Madge that she went on the
  coach outing but she preferred to stay with me. By the following day I was
  still tender but able to walk and sit without too much discomfort. The excursion
  was to see a couple of castles and thinking Madge would like to go, I suggested
  we went. I sketched enough material to do a painting later and at the request
  of two more guests, I did pencil portraits of them. We spent the morning of
  the final day by the loch. &quot;There ought to be a mermaid sitting on that
  rock, like the one in Denmark or somewhere,&quot; Madge suggested. 
&quot;And you ought to be the mermaid,&quot; I joked, &quot;In fact you will
  be the mermaid.&quot; 
We returned to the hotel and I sat Madge on the bathroom stool in the pose
  I wanted and produced some sketches. Most of that afternoon I spent in the
  activities room working up the painting of the loch with Madge tastefully posed
  on the rock, her mermaid's tail curved gracefully around the base. I did give
  her a slightly more youthful body but the face was unmistakably Madge. I'd
  just finished when Daphne, Jean and a crowd of others came in and after some
  serious and some ribald comments, Daphne carried it gleefully into the lounge
  to show the others. Vera saw it but made no comment. 
The end of the holiday should have seen the end of my 'marriage' to Madge
  but after a couple of days apart she came round to my studio and asked if I
  would like to extend my 'marriage' to her. We'd had a lot of fun on the week
  away, so how could I refuse?
