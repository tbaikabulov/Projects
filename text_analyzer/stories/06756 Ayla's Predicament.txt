Ayla's Predicament

�I did tell you not to lie down there, Ayla� said Ariel lightly.

�Yes, I know�, the tall woman replied with a sigh �but you also said &#8216;don&#8217;t go in that building&#8217;, &#8216;don&#8217;t open that door&#8217;, &#8216;don&#8217;t go down there&#8217; &#8216;don&#8217;t sit in that chair&#8217; and &#8216;don&#8217;t touch that&#8217; at least a dozen times, so your track record really didn&#8217;t seem that good�.&nbsp; Ayla smiled as she said this, to show that she was only teasing.

Ariel giggled.&nbsp; �I don&#8217;t know - looks like I was right all along!�

Ayla looked down at the cuffs which had snapped around her wrists and ankles when she lay down on the table.&nbsp; It should have been easy enough to get up, she thought to herself.&nbsp; She and Ariel had spent the morning wandering around an empty dungeon that Izatiger had told Ayla about.&nbsp; �C&#8217;mon, it&#8217;ll be fun�, Ayla had said, and Ariel had happily tagged along, even if she had been somewhat less adventurous about leaping with abandon onto every device in sight.&nbsp; Though maybe �dungeon� wasn&#8217;t really the right word, since it was actually very high-tech - futuristic, even.&nbsp; Apparently the passage of 1000 years didn&#8217;t diminish mankind&#8217;s interest in torturing one another - only the methods changed.

Ayla looked at the cuffs again.&nbsp; It wasn&#8217;t a surprise they were there, of course - pretty much the same thing had happened on every chair and device she had tried out.&nbsp; But these ones, for some reason, didn&#8217;t unlock when she wanted them to.

�Check to see if there&#8217;s a button or something, will you Ariel?� she said.&nbsp; Ariel walked around the table.&nbsp; �Nope, no, nothing so far, nope...wait!� cried Ariel.&nbsp; �There&#8217;s some kind of - control panel or something, a screen and a bunch of buttons, here at the end.�&nbsp; Ariel crouched down near Ayla&#8217;s feet.&nbsp; �Most of the buttons don&#8217;t say anything, but there&#8217;s one that says &#8216;up&#8217; - I&#8217;ll press that one!�

�No, wait a min-� Ayla started to call out, but too late, as the cuffs around her arms suddenly shot outward, pulling her arms well above her head, stretching her muscles as far as they would go, just short of being painful.

�Oops, sorry� called Ariel, who then began to giggle.

�What is it?� asked Ayla, and Ariel gestured towards Ayla&#8217;s chest.&nbsp; The sudden motion of her arms and shoulders had pulled Ayla&#8217;s top up with them, where it now sat as more of a necklace than anything else.&nbsp; 

�I told you your boobs were going to pop out of that shorty-sweater one of these days� laughed Ariel.&nbsp; �You&#8217;ve never said any such thing!� replied Ayla, indignantly.&nbsp; �I haven&#8217;t?� replied Ariel �well, I&#8217;ve thought it often enough, that&#8217;s for sure!�.&nbsp; Ariel giggled again as she came over to pull Ayla&#8217;s top back down - though she stopped, her fingers waving in confusion in the air, tentative, not quite sure what to do.

�Oh for god&#8217;s sake, Ariel, get over yourself - just pull my top back down!� Ayla cried out.&nbsp; Ariel delicately grabbed the sides of Ayla&#8217;s sweater, trying not to touch her skin, then tugged the sweater as far back down over Ayla&#8217;s impressive breasts as she could before letting go: at which point the sweater immediately popped back up to Ayla&#8217;s neck.&nbsp; Ariel tried again, this time a bit more boldly, giggling as her hands ran along her friend&#8217;s breasts, trying to anchor the sweater more firmly - which again snapped almost straight back to Ayla&#8217;s neck, this time pausing briefly to snag on one of her oddly firm nipples. Laughing out loud, Ariel grabbed the sweater firmly in one hand, pulling it with all her might, while her other hand literally shoved Ayla&#8217;s boobs one after the other into the tight top. Ariel dissolved into tears of laughter as the sweater shot upwards once more, Ayla&#8217;s boobs bouncing attractively in their release.

�Fine - look - forget it� said Ayla.&nbsp; �It&#8217;s not like I care that much - just work on getting me out of this, will you?�.&nbsp; Ariel did her best to stop laughing, and returned to the control panel.&nbsp; �Ooh - I should have seen this one before - &#8216;straps&#8217;, it says.&nbsp; They&#8217;re already on you, so this button must take them off now!�&nbsp; Ayla had barely managed to say �I don&#8217;t th-� when a strap shot out of the table, securing her even more firmly at the waist.&nbsp; �Oh - sorry!� said Ariel, pushing the button once again, this time triggering two more straps, one looping around Ayla&#8217;s shoulders, the other her forehead.&nbsp; �Ok, not that one after all.&nbsp; Then I bet it&#8217;s this one� Ariel said, with entirely misplaced confidence.

Rollers set into the table began to rotate, spinning below Ayla&#8217;s body.&nbsp; �Hey - this isn&#8217;t - that bad� said Ayla �It&#8217;s like a massag - ouch!�.&nbsp; Ayla squealed as the rollers pinched a bit of her skin, pulling it painfully down before releasing it again - then another pinch, and another, in unpredictable places.&nbsp; �Do you think - eep! - you could - ow! - get it to stop do -aagh! - doing this?� Ayla asked, as calmly as she could manage.&nbsp; �As far as I can tell the rollers have got to go through one full rotation� Ariel replied �No way to stop it sooner�.&nbsp; Ayla steeled herself - ack! -&nbsp; to tolerate the - oww! - rest of the pinches.&nbsp; At that point her calmness was challenged further as she felt a tight pressure in her legs, threatening to cut off her circulation. 

�Look at that� Ariel said �Those ripped jeans of yours are caught in the rollers!&nbsp; I said they&#8217;d get you into trouble one day, but this isn&#8217;t what I expected!�.&nbsp; �Ariel�, said Ayla, gritting her teeth �you have never said any such thing - and before you tell me you&#8217;ve thought it, could you do something about it before all the blood flow is cut off?&nbsp; My knife is in my pocket - hmm?�.&nbsp; Ariel quickly took Ayla&#8217;s knife and slit the legs of Ayla&#8217;s pants.&nbsp; Ayla let out a sigh of relief as Ariel commented �Gee, now look&nbsp; - the rollers are ripping the pants right off you!&nbsp; You&#8217;d almost think it was designed that way!�.&nbsp; Ayla, now naked but for her scarf that was once a sweater, thought to herself that she did not share Ariel&#8217;s detached interest in the technology, as the rollers finally came to a stop.

�I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s something to do with that &#8216;up&#8217; button� Ariel said pensively.&nbsp; �I bet that - hmmm - cntrl-up, something like that will do it�.&nbsp; Ayla said sternly �Ariel, don&#8217;t start pressing buttons at random� just as, coincidentally, Ariel did exactly that.&nbsp; Ayla only just had time to form the thought �I&#8217;m standing on my head� before she wasn&#8217;t any more - instead, she was hanging upside down below the table.&nbsp; �Hey, good thing about those extra straps!� Ariel called out.&nbsp; �Not helping!� Ayla replied.

�Wait, this one must be it - &#8216;down&#8217;!� Ariel called, as she pressed another button.&nbsp; That button, at least, was not misnamed.&nbsp; Sure enough, the table began to move slowly down, toward the floor.&nbsp; �This is probably not good� Ayla thought to herself, beginning to become a little concerned for the first time.&nbsp; Her agitation rose when she realised that the floor was not the only thing she was moving toward.&nbsp; A small platform lay below her, covered in tiny needles, all pointing nastily upward at her.&nbsp; And that was not all.&nbsp; Someone had mounted - �what kind of sick mind thinks up these things!!� Ayla wondered in passing - what looked to all appearances like a dildo on some kind of track, an odd sort of toy sex train, some kind of light or sensor thingy shining up from it.&nbsp; Ayla thought to herself that this dildo was strangely mounted, since angled straight up at the ceiling as it was the most it was likely to do was poke her painfully in the belly.&nbsp; At that moment the contraption whirred into activity, its light coming on and the dildo travelling along the track below her, parallel to her body.&nbsp; 

�Um - you ok under there?� Ariel called.&nbsp; �The sooner you can stop me dropping the better� Ayla called out, a tinge of worry entering her voice.&nbsp; She had realised now the dildo&#8217;s intended purpose, as its light reflected off her lips and the whirring stopped, the shaft waiting menacingly below her mouth.&nbsp; The table&#8217;s descent was not fast, but even so the dildo was coming uncomfortably close to her, and the strap on her forehead prevented her from moving away.

So intent was Ayla on this oral threat that the sudden pricking pain in her nipples caught her quite by surprise.&nbsp; She would have jumped had she been able.&nbsp; �Of course these boobs of mine reached the needles first� she thought to herself with a sigh and a wince.&nbsp; The pinpricks were painful, of course...but they were not...just pain.&nbsp; If you... thought about it... just right, Ayla thought to herself, you could...almost...make it...seem..like,,,something not..pain.&nbsp; Ayla closed her eyes to help focus on and transform the sensations, which became less like pain and more like pleasure as the pressure was distributed over more and more needles, her heavy breasts supported on their points, and as she kept her mind...just...so.&nbsp; 

It was working remarkably well right until the moment the table suddenly dropped an inch all at once and stopped, and she found her mouth stuffed with the dildo, which forced its way past her lips, and her breasts cried out with hundreds of small jabbing pains.

�Ariel, get me up now!� Ayla cried out - or at least she tried to, though what she actually said sounded more like �A-ee-ah, e ee uh ow!!�.&nbsp; Ariel quickly stabbed at a button, which caused the dildo to drop lower - but the needles to rise.&nbsp; �NUH-UHN!� Ayla cried out.&nbsp; Ariel hit the button again, and the needles began to descend, pulling their tiny pricks from her skin, leaving row upon row of tiny red dots - as the dildo began to rise even higher, pushing its large prick even further into Ayla&#8217;s mouth.&nbsp; Ariel pressed a button, and Ayla found herself, relieved, tears beginning to form in her eyes, her glorious breasts a mass of stinging pain, rising into the air, the table flipping sideways once more to deposit her back where she started.

�It&#8217;s ok� said Ariel �I&#8217;m pretty sure I&#8217;ve got it figured out now.&nbsp; There&#8217;s a display screen here that sort of tells you what to do�.&nbsp; Ayla lay panting, calming herself - it hadn&#8217;t been that bad, not really - a bit surprising, that was all.&nbsp; �Ok, um, it says first I need to turn handle B - but I don&#8217;t see a handle B� Ariel said, looking down at the table.&nbsp; �Here&#8217;s a button B - I&#8217;ll press that�.&nbsp; She did so, and the lower half of the table immediately hinged itself down the middle, splitting into two parts, each swinging outward carrying Ayla&#8217;s leg in opposite directions.&nbsp; �Wow, Ayla - you&#8217;re really flexible!� said Ariel, admiring the near-splits posture Ayla now held.&nbsp; Ayla, unable to lift her head, settled for directing her most withering look at the ceiling.

�Ok, I bet that&#8217;s handle B I see now� said Ariel, gazing at the thick rod revealed where the table had parted.&nbsp; �Let me pull it - ooh, it&#8217;s all spongy - well, not all, it&#8217;s spongy on the surface, but it&#8217;s pretty stiff, otherwise�.&nbsp; Ariel pulled on the handle futilely for a moment, then examined it more closely.&nbsp; �Um, Ayla...I...I don&#8217;t think that handle B pulls up..it looks like its on some kind of wheel, and I can see where it has to rotate through to - it...it looks like some kind of lock�.&nbsp; �I&#8217;m not going to like what you&#8217;re going to say next, am I� said Ayla with a sigh.&nbsp; 

�Well..you...you might like..half what I&#8217;m going to say� Ariel replied.&nbsp; �Half?� said Ayla.&nbsp; �Yeah - I have to slide the handle forward six inches, and, and...I..I think you&#8217;ve guessed that this handle is, like, this far from, from, from your - you know - your pussy� Ariel said, holding up two fingers about an inch apart, �and the only way to rotate this forward is..is..is...�&nbsp; Ariel stammered and so Ayla took over: �I get it, Ariel - you&#8217;ve got to fuck me with this handle to slide it forward.&nbsp; It&#8217;s ok - I can take it.&nbsp; But what did you mean about liking half of what you said?�&nbsp; 

�Um - you know I said I had to slide it forward six inches?�

�Ye-es...� replied Ayla cautiously.

�Well, then I have to slide it forward...the other six inches�.

Ayla drew her breath in quickly.&nbsp; That was...a lot, no question.&nbsp; �Ariel?� she said �Just so I know - could you use your fingers to show me how big this thing is around?&nbsp; Just...just so I can get ready?�

�No� Ariel replied.

�What?� said Ayla with surprise, �Why won&#8217;t you do that?�

�Oh, I don&#8217;t mean I won&#8217;t - it&#8217;s just my fingers...um...my fingers aren&#8217;t long enough to show you how big it is around...Oh wait!� Ariel said, brightening �If I use both hands I can do it!�&nbsp; Ariel made a dismayingly large circle in the air over Ayla&#8217;s head.&nbsp; 

Ayla took a deep breath - waiting wouldn&#8217;t make this any easier.&nbsp; �Ok, Ariel - I&#8217;m ready�, she said, her voice a picture of determination.

The first couple of inches were the worst, she found.&nbsp; It was hard - god! it was hard! - to feel herself stretched so, to, to, accommodate the girth of this strange intruder.&nbsp; But once she had done that, once it was in - oh, it was in! - then each new inch was easier - or at least no harder.&nbsp; It was just - more.&nbsp; Yes, the first couple of inches were definitely the worst - until it came to the last couple of inches.&nbsp; She was filled already, filled as she had not been before, and felt stretched in places she didn&#8217;t know she had - and yet still further this massive invader penetrated her.&nbsp; Worse, it was becoming difficult for Ariel to push it - the small woman had to literally put her shoulder to the handle to force the last inch in.

But eventually it was in - it was definitely in - and Ayla, her back as arched as it could be while strapped to the table, her forehead beaded with sweat, her neck muscles tight, not daring to move, Ayla heard handle B snick into place.&nbsp; Ariel came to stand by Ayla&#8217;s head, a finger brushing hair from her eyes, as Ayla choked out the words �why aren&#8217;t the cuffs coming undone?�

�Ayla� said Ariel in a low tone �I&#8217;m really sorry, but...remember when I said you might like half of what I had to say?�

Straining with the effort of not crying out from how stretched she already was, Ayla looked at Ariel, knowing she would carry on.

�Um, I didn&#8217;t actually tell you the second half yet...it..it wasn&#8217;t just that...that handle B had to go a long way in�

After a short pause, at the same moment, the two young women said �there&#8217;s a handle A�.

�Ji-� Ariel began, before Ayla blurted out �I swear, if you say &#8216;jinx&#8217; right now I will tear myself loose from this table and break you in half!!!�.

�Sorry�, said Ariel, �and you&#8217;re right, there is - there is -&nbsp; a handle A.&nbsp; It&#8217;s - it&#8217;s on - on - on a wheel too, only, where it is, it&#8217;s...it has to..�

�Oh for god&#8217;s sake, Ariel� Ayla cried out �If you are about to say something other than that you have to shove handle A up my ass, then say it right now - otherwise let&#8217;s get it over with!�.

�No, you guessed it - that&#8217;s where it goes� said Ariel �but it&#8217;s not as big, if that helps.&nbsp; Well, not as long, anyway - I think it might be a tiny bit thicker�.

Ayla groaned.&nbsp; She wasn&#8217;t sure she could actually do this - not at the same time as the other one.&nbsp; �You&#8217;re absolutely sure there&#8217;s no other way?� she asked.&nbsp; �I&#8217;m sure� said Ariel �the instructions are actually pretty clear�. 

It was difficult.&nbsp; It was all Ayla could do not to scream out, and she desperately wanted to move, her body thrashed against the restraints, but she could not.&nbsp; Ariel pushed handle A slowly into her anus, pushing it past that first little pucker, then stopping, letting Ayla do her best to relax, to adjust, to...form around it.&nbsp; Finally, when Ayla whispered �Ok� then, as they had decided, Ariel pushed as hard and as smoothly and as quickly as she could, the rod sliding inexorably deeper into Ayla, inch after inch, Ayla&#8217;s mind a mass of sensations, till finally handle A clicked into place, and slowly, slowly, the handles withdrew themselves automatically, the table closed itself, the straps released themselves from around Ayla&#8217;s body, the cuffs at her feet and wrists came unbound, and the table tilted just slightly enough that Ayla found herself sliding off the end, finally free, lying in a heap on the floor at the end of the table.&nbsp; 

Panting, Ayla looked up to see the screen Ariel had mentioned in front of her: �Ayla Jaxxon - torment mode II� it read, with today&#8217;s date.&nbsp; �It was a good thing you were able to figure out how this worked, Ariel�, Ayla said between breaths.&nbsp; 

�Yes - Tiger said that it wasn&#8217;t too bad was you got the hang of it� Ariel replied.

�Tiger said...?� Ayla asked

�Um..yes...when...when she told us...about this place...remember?&nbsp; How the equipment all has a tutorial built in?�

Ayla did not remember that - in fact she did not remember Ariel being there when Tiger had told her of this place.&nbsp; But sure enough, looking up she noticed that the previous entry on the screen was �Ariel Emms - tutorial mode�.&nbsp; Looking more closely, though, she realised that that entry was accompanied by - yesterday&#8217;s date.

�It occurs to me, Ariel� said Ayla �you&#8217;re usually so timid - and yet I don&#8217;t think you blushed once during this whole time - did you?&nbsp; Actually, you haven&#8217;t acted like yourself at all today.�

For the first time that day, Ariel turned bright red, replying �It - probably - it must have been because I was so worried about you!&nbsp; That was why - I forgot all about myself - but at least it all turned out ok.&nbsp; And - I know you&#8217;re kind of - worn out - but...are you ready to go?� Ariel asked hopefully.

And as she saw the keys to Ariel&#8217;s cuffs lying below the table, among the shreds of her jeans, Ayla gathered herself together, smiled inside, and thought �Oh no, my little darling - not ready yet - not nearly ready!�
