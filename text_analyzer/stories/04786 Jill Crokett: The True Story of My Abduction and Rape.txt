Jill Crokett:
The True Story of My Abduction and Rape

&nbsp;

By Jill Crokett

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

It is hard to talk about it.
My therapists over the years have all said it would help to open up but I�ve
never be able to, so I�ve decided to try writing about it and see if that has some
therapeutic effect. We�ll see. 

&nbsp;

Thirty years have gone by
and it�s still like yesterday in my mind. I was barely nineteen, in the summer
of 1976, and I felt as if I ruled the world. No harm could befall me.� I had left my mom, aunt, grandmother, and two
cousins in southeastern Texas
in order to fulfill my childhood dream, my fantasy really, of living near my
dad, his new wife, and my half brother, just north of Seattle. 



&nbsp;



&nbsp;

I was eight years old when my
parents divorced in 1966, and my mother, with me in tow, returned to her
hometown in southeast Texas.� Taking this eight-year-old girl away from her
daddy was emotionally traumatic, and for the next ten years I only saw my dad
for one week a year each summer.� As a
girl I often pretended he was there to share in the details of my everyday life.
�Dad, who had a good job with Boeing,
always remembered to send something special at Christmas, and he never forgot
my birthday, but the detachment hurt, and I tended to idealized him in his
absence. �My mother never spoke his name,
and I learned at a young age never to break her unspoken rule of never talking
about �him�.� 

&nbsp;

For years we lived on mom�s
modest lab technician salary from the local hospital.� During those lean years I often dreamed of
having a real dad I could live with and finally, in the Spring
of 1973, mom remarried.� But by when I
was almost sixteen. �Up until then I had come
to believe that mother just didn�t like men, that SHE had a problem with
relationships, with marriage, but my step-dad Ron eventually led me to see things
differently. �Ron was great; a good,
decent man, and a very good husband. �My
problem was, he just wasn�t a dad. 

&nbsp;

Mom married Ron, when I was
in the tenth grade.� Our lives changed
dramatically, but Ron never replaced my dad. �Oh, sure, we moved to a better neighborhood, and
mom drove a car that wasn�t falling apart for the first time that I could
remember.� Ron even bought me my first car (a dark blue 1969 two-door
Chevy Malibu) for my seventeenth birthday in 1974. �But for me, Ron was always �Mom�s new husband�
and never �my new dad.�� 

&nbsp;

When I look back on it now, I,
a rather busty, sexually developed teenager, unknowingly probably intimidated
Ron from getting too close, or maybe even Mom subliminally discourage him.� She could
be rather possessive. �Or maybe I was just too old to connect with a new
dad by then and didn�t know it.� 

&nbsp;

After they married, occasionally
at night I thought I could hear Ron making love to my mother behind their
closed bedroom door. �Well, let me clarify
that. I did occasionally hear my mom faintly moaning, or possibly breathing
forcefully, in their bedroom late at night.�
It was a little strange, I mean since I had grown up thinking that mom
didn�t like men all that much. �I mean,
she rarely talked about them, and she never talked about dad. But my misconception
about her and men was put to rest when I came home from school one day about
eight months after she remarried.� I
can�t remember if it was field hockey or cheerleading practice that was canceled
that day, but there I was, home early.�� �

&nbsp;

As soon as I walked in the
back door and stepped into the kitchen I heard what I thought was my then 41-year-old
mother crying.� Concerned, I naively walked
back to her room and opened the door.� In
a flash of visual images I would never forget, I saw Ron�s tanned, sweaty back.
�I saw his bare, white butt cheeks
rapidly pumping up and down. The bottoms of mom�s feet were oddly facing the
ceiling as her calves rested on Ron�s shoulders.� Her thighs were spread wide open with her
knees to either side of her.� Her head
tossed side to side as her hands grasped the bed sheet. �

&nbsp;

Totally embarrassed at
walking in on them making love, I quickly but silently shut the bedroom
door.� Lost in their passion, they had
never noticed my momentary intrusion. �Stunned,
I stood motionless in the hallway, not wanting them to hear me.� Mom continued to scream like I had never
heard before. It was not the muffled moans I had previously heard coming from her
room at night. No, this was total sexual release that she obviously reserved
for moments when I was not around.

&nbsp;

Mom�s abandon went on for
several minutes as I tiptoed away, slowly moving down the hallway.� I thought my heart would jump out of my
chest.� I was shocked to hear my Mom, an
�oh darn� and �oh shucks� churchgoer, use words I�d never heard her utter
before.� 

&nbsp;

Hearing my mother scream �oh
god fuck me, oh god fuck me, hard, fuck me hard�, then, almost crying, sob �It�s
too big, oh god, oh god Ron, it�s so big� as Ron pounded her was certainly an
eye opener for me.� She finished with a
flailing wail as the headboard rattled.�
I quietly went out on the back porch and sat on the steps.� For the first time I realized that they had
their own life, their own dreams, and I felt I wasn�t a part of them.� Ron would never be my dad, how could he? �He was mom�s lover, and she would never let
him get close.� But it wasn�t fair, because
she had kept my dad away from me too.� Such
were the thoughts of an insecure sixteen year old girl.

&nbsp;

Over the next year I made it
clear to my mom that I wanted to go to college in Seattle. �She wouldn�t
hear of it.� Out of the
question.� But the more she wanted
to keep me from my father, the more I resolved to leave Texas for Washington State.� As I neared graduation in the Spring of 1975, and my 18th birthday approached, Ron
attempted to appease the situation by offering to pay my tuition in full if I
stayed in town and attended the local college for my freshman year.� With a smile, Ron told mom �if we keep her
here one more year, she�ll fall in love, get married, and never leave
town.�� He was wrong, but his plan did
work for a year.� Yes, I reluctantly
postponed my dream and took Ron up on his offer, but, unknown to Ron, the real
reason I took his offer was, by that time, I had nailed a super-cute boyfriend I
met while working at the local country club, and I was beginning to study male
anatomy with him in my spare time.

&nbsp;

About a month before my high
school graduation I used all my charm and most of my 18-year-old natural assets
to land a fun weekend job as a hostess and greeter at a swank local country
club. �It was a goldmine for flirtations
with cute guys, and it was the pie job that all the other girls were envious
of.� I met my boyfriend for the next year
my first night on the job.� His
grandparents were charter members, and his dad was on the club�s board.� I know they sound like snobs, but his family were
all super nice to me that year.� It was in
that freshman year, working at the club on weekends, that I refined my social skills
with men. I found I was a natural charmer.

�

By the end of my freshman
year, as the summer of 1976 approached and my boyfriend began to bore me with
talk of marriage and a country club reception, my dad convinced me to move to Seattle.� I had just
turned nineteen, and I was ready to go.

&nbsp;

Mom cried for days.� Ron checked and rechecked my car, and he even
bought me a new set of tires.� I broke up
with my boyfriend over his jealousy after he learned I had dated another guest from
the club, but I in fact had planned it, having wished to break up with him
before I left. �

&nbsp;

Some of the club workers,
even a few members, threw a small goodbye party for me one night after closing
in the club lounge.� I had worked there a
year, had made a lot of friends, and everyone loved me. �And why not?� I was 19, five-foot-five, pretty, medium
length blond hair with bangs, had natural D breasts, clear skin, beautiful
teeth, was a poster for health, and always smiled.� I could have had the world on a leash and
didn�t know it, all I wanted was to be with my dad, to
be part of his family in Seattle.� �

&nbsp;

The day before I left for Seattle I received notice that my freshman college credits
had transferred to my new school in Seattle.� Barely
nineteen, I backed out of the driveway as mom stood and cried.� I was ready to take on the world.

Chapter Two

&nbsp;

Author�s Note:
While this story is definitely true, the author wishes to point out that all of the names used in this narrative,
and even some of the place names, have been altered to protect the identity of
the parties involved.� While the author
in no way wishes to protect the guilty, revealing their names could also expose
the innocent.� While the author
accurately describes herself and her experiences, her own name is also a
pseudonym.� 

&nbsp;

Should any name used in this story be that of a real living
individual, it is purely coincidence.�
The author also wishes to note that any depiction of violence toward
women or children in this narrative is solely for the purpose of recanting an accurate and true description of actual events, and such recantation is in
no way meant to be exploitative or abusive, as the author in no was condones
such acts.� It is the author�s hope, that
by describing her own painful experiences, others will be compelled to speak
out and share their own, both raising the awareness of others and empowering
their own healing. Most sincerely, Jill Crokett



&nbsp;



&nbsp;

&nbsp;

The three day drive to Seattle
was exciting for a young woman who had ever really been any place outside of Texas,
but as I remember, the journey itself was for the most part uneventful.� I do remember being a little nervous staying
in mom-and-pop roadside motels on two nights, the kind with the big neon signs,
one in Amarillo and the other in Reno,
 Nevada. �I was a bit worried at night, not for my own
safety, but because of all the stuff I had packed in my car.� I was afraid someone would break into my
packed to the gills car and steal my things while I slept. 

&nbsp;

I remember that Mom and Ron were quite worried about me
being on the road alone, and even though in those days long-distance telephone
calls were very expensive, they made me promise I would call them each night
when I had checked into my motel.� That
was way, way before the days of cell phones.�


&nbsp;

In Reno I
remember staying in a little $15 a night motel that seem
to have honeymooners in the room next door.�
They were going at it every few hours and the girl kept waking me up
with her screaming.� I remember wondering
if her man was hurting her, because her screaming, crying really, was so
intense.� Other than that one time that I
walked in on my Mom and Ron, I had never heard other people making love
before.� As for me, I wasn't a virgin,
but I had only had sex a few times in my life at that point, and I certainly
wasn't very experienced.� 

&nbsp;

I arrived in Seattle
nearly two months before school would start.�
I wanted to spend some time with my Dad before I had to hit the books. I
planned to be a commuter student, living in the guest room of his house.� I was hoping that that arrangement would work
out, because I didn't want to live in the dorm, and I wanted the opportunity to
bond with my long separated Dad. �Living
with Dad and Evelyn would also save me a lot of money, because I could live
there free.� Dad had encouraged me to
stay with him and his wife, and he had actually written to me and invited me to
live with them.� Arriving early also give
me time to better acquaint myself with my step mom Evelyn and my little
half-brother Billy, who was about ten years old.

&nbsp;

Dad had married Evelyn just a few months after he and Mom�s
divorce was final.� Mother had never told
me any of the details of their break-up, but over the years I had grown to
suspect that Dad and Evelyn might have been seeing each other before my parents
split.� If that were true, Evelyn, now 33
and 12 years younger than my 45-year-old dad, would have been about my age,
just 19, when she wrecked my parents marriage.� But I had never held anything against Evelyn,
because she was always nice to me, and I wasn't sure of the facts.� Evelyn was the sweet, passive type, and it
was hard to be angry with her.� Anyway,
the early relationship between her and dad was just something that was never
talked about.

&nbsp;

At 33 Evelyn was just 14 years older than me, and once I
moved in she treated me more like a little sister than a step-daughter mom.� I really liked that.� She pretty much let me do anything I
wanted.� Almost as soon as I arrived in Seattle,
she was forever trying to hook me up with guys, though usually they weren�t my
type.� She tended to like �bad boy�
types, bikers and such, and would always point them out to me, especially when
my Dad wasn�t around. 

&nbsp;

I never thought of Evelyn as an intellectual, but rather a
simple gal, both in style and desire. Socially, she always presented herself in
a somewhat submissive demeanor, especially when interacting with my 45-year-old
father.� 

&nbsp;

Physically, Evelyn had dark, almost jet black hair which
contrasted with her rather pale white skin.�
She was a little shorter than me, probably 5 foot 3.� She wore her shoulder length hair tied back
and never made a fuss over it.� But I
should point out that Evelyn was not an unattractive woman, as she had an
hourglass figure with a narrow waist, which I'm sure Dad frequently
appreciated.� When he came home from
work, he always wrapped his arms around her waist for a moment and kissed her square
on the lips.� It was a big change from
Ron and Mom, who just pecked each other on the cheek.� 

&nbsp;

Evelyn always dressed casual, usually in slacks or
jeans.� Occasional she put on a denim
miniskirt and halter top if they were going down to the pub.� A sundress would have been real �dress-up�
for her. Overall, I guess she just wasn't into fussing over herself the way the
girls in Texas were.� When I look back on it, she was probably just
a bit liberated before the rest of
us. She had ample boobs and around the house often went without a bra, her hard
nipples poking through an old, often torn, T-shirt.

�

Evelyn smoked about a pack of Tareyton cigarettes a day, a
habit I unfortunately picked up from her soon after arriving in Seattle, and one which would take me another ten years to
break.� She also liked to drink a bit,
usually Olympia, the local beer,
but also cheap wine and frozen cocktails.�
She and my father frequented a neighborhood pub several nights a week,
usually on weekends but occasionally in the evening after he got off work.� The legal drinking age was 18 was back in
1976, and they used to try to entice me to come along.� If I didn't have studying to do I would
occasionally join them, but I usually stayed home and studied or kept an eye on
my half-brother Billy.� I thought of it
as my way of giving my Dad and his wife some time to themselves, and it gave me
time to develop a relationship with my little brother, who really didn�t know
me.

&nbsp;

Evelyn was very different from my Mom.� She didn't work, she didn�t attend church, she
didn�t read books, in fact she never even finished
high school.� She certainly didn't spend
much time fussing over the house or Billy.�
I soon learned that Evelyn's only real occupation was pleasing my Dad.� When I arrived in Seattle
in the summer of 1976, I didn�t know anything about the subcultures of B&amp;D
and S&amp;M, in fact, as a na�ve teenager from the South, I had never even
heard of them. 

&nbsp;

The other woman on the scene in those days was Evelyn�s best
friend Cheryl, the thirtyish divorcee who lived next door with her 11-year-old
daughter, Terri.� Cheryl didn�t work
either, but lived on the alimony and child support payments her no-good
cheating aircraft engineer ex-husband was required to make monthly.� The poor bastard also had to make her house
payment for ten years and give her half his pension when he retired from the
big B.� She had it all in writing. 

&nbsp;

Evelyn was also pretty good friends with a few ladies from
the neighborhood pub, but other than them and Cheryl, she had no other friends
or family that I knew of.� From the
moment my Dad got home, her primary focus was attending to Dad�s physical,
social, and emotional needs.� His request
was her command.� The odd thing to me was, she really seemed to enjoy it, catering to him that is. �She definitely loved my father very much, and
would do anything for him.� 

&nbsp;

While Evelyn wanted to spend as much time as possible with
my father, most of her time was in fact spent with Cheryl, because Dad was
often working overtime building jumbo jets.�
The two moms visited with each other, in one-another's kitchen, several
times a day.� Cheryl would often walk in
unannounced, and so would her daughter Terri, who was about a year older than
Billy.� It was strange at first, but I
got used to it.� After a while we were
all like sorority sisters.� 

&nbsp;

Evelyn and Cheryl would sit around all day drinking coffee
and smoking cigarettes as they gabbed up girl talk.� The biggest challenge of their day was to
come up with things to talk about.� They
often gossiped about people from the pub.�
The kids, at their age, pretty much looked after themselves.� Having grown up with a working mom, and having worked nearly 20 hours a week myself during my
first year of college, it was weird for me to be around women who did nothing
all day but gab and coffee-klatch.�
Listening to them, in those weeks before my classes started, I would sit
and hear things my mother never talked about. �Weird girl talk.� Frank sexual conversations
that often shocked me.� I would
get caught up with listening their sometimes weird
conversations, but always tried to keep my mouth shut.

&nbsp;

One-day Cheryl and Evelyn were talking about their
gynecologists.� I remember being, as a
na�ve 19-year-old who had never been to one, shocked at their frankness and
lack of embarrassment as they spoke.�
Cheryl started out by saying how humiliating it was when she went into
the hospital to give birth to Terri in 1965.�
As I sat in Evelyn's kitchen, Cheryl, lighting one Marlboro off the
other, graphically described being stripped naked and having her pussy shaved bald
in front of several medical students.�
Evelyn recanted with a similar story.�
I remember being surprised, having never heard of the procedure, and
wondered if I would face it someday too.�
Cheryl went on to say that she had had an abortion since her divorce,
and they shaved their bare for that two,

&nbsp;

While the conversation surprised me, I didn't feel it was
over the edge.� The first time I began to
feel that way was the day that Evelyn described being spanked by my father.� She said it
so matter-of-factly, as if it was normal or appropriate, that made me
wonder.� She went on to say that she
probably deserved it.� I said nothing,
clearly shocked.� But the first real
shock would take place a few weeks later.

&nbsp;

Evelyn was totally a lazy when he came to housework, and my
dad paid for a Mexican lady come in one morning a week and clean the place up.
It was really absurd, because Evelyn didn't work.� The Mexican maid didn't speak English, and
none of us spoke Spanish, so it was really odd.�
She just walked around as if we weren't there, straightening the place
up.� I can�t remember her name.

&nbsp;

Dad had a large saltwater fish tank in the living room,
probably 50 gallons or more. It was his only hobby and he loved his fish.� One day Terri and Billy were playing in the
living room and got into a heated shouting match.� Evelyn and I were over at Cheryl's next door
having coffee.� We had left the kids with
the Mexican maid, who is cleaning up.�
The maid ran into Cheryl's kitchen screaming in Spanish.� Evelyn, Cheryl and I went running back into
our living room to find the front of dad�s fish tank shattered, his fish
flopping all over the floor, and Evelyn's beautiful new shag carpet soaked with
50 gallon�s of saltwater.� One of the
kids had thrown an ashtray and struck the tank.

&nbsp;

For the next two hours we tried to save the fish and the
carpet in vain.� Evelyn and Cheryl held
an impromptu kangaroo court in which Terri pointed the finger at Billy and
accused him of throwing the ashtray at her when she beat him at a board
game.� She claimed he missed and struck
the tank.� The maid, who didn't
understand or speak English, said nothing.

&nbsp;

When 11-year-old Terri finished speaking, Evelyn, without
saying a word, stood up and unbuckled the thin leather belt she had on and
quickly slipped it off her blue jeans.�
Then, in front of me, Cheryl, the maid, and young Terri, she pulled my
brother Billy's pants and underwear down to his ankles.� As Billy protested �Mom, Mom, No� she
strapped his bare bottom with her belt in front of myself, the maid, and the
two female neighbors.� As mad as I was
about dad's fish tank, his fish, and the new carpet, I remember feeling
embarrassed for Billy, and feeling that Evelyn rushed to judgment.� It was the first time I felt that my whole
new situation in Seattle was really
weird, just totally bizarre.� Had I moved
from Texas to The Twilight
Zone?� 

&nbsp;

To make matters worse, Dad got home late that night after
working overtime and was really exhausted.�
Things were stressful enough at work, but when he walked into the
disaster that was his living room, saw the smashed front of his fish tank, and
learned that most of his prized saltwater fish were dead, he went
ballistic.� �Where�s Billy� he
shouted.� Evelyn told him Billy was in
the bathtub, getting ready for bed.� Dad,
after retrieving a ping-pong paddle from the rec room in the basement, headed
straight for the bathroom.� I thought he
would wait for Billy to get out of the tub, but he was so angry, so fuming mad,
he burst right in, pulled naked little Billy dripping wet out of the tub, and
dragged him into the living room in front of me and Evelyn.� Dad sat down, locked Billy down over his lap,
and paddled his butt cheeks hard and fast for at least twenty firm strokes,
while all the while Billy sobbed and pleaded �no daddy, no, please no, no more,
I didn�t do it, I didn�t do it!�� 

&nbsp;

To make the whole situation even more bizarre, the next
afternoon, though it wasn't her day to work, the maid showed up with her cousin
who spoke English.� The cousin explained
that the maid was upset and hadn�t been able to sleep last night.� Apparently the maid had nearly witnessed the
fish tank act, having heard it all transpire as she cleaned in the next room,
and she felt sure Billy was innocent.�
She believed it was in fact 11-year-old Terri who had heaved the heavy
ceramic ashtray, missing Billy and striking the saltwater fish tank, then lied
about it all.� She felt so bad after
witnessing the pants down belt whipping Evelyn had given him that she couldn�t
sleep, and just had to say something to someone who could translate for
her.� The kindly, middle-aged Mexican
maid looked so upset, I was just glad she hadn�t witnessed the second bare ass
hide tanning Daddy had given him.��� 

&nbsp;

Evelyn called Cheryl and she came over right away with Terri
in tow to hear the maid's cousin recant the story in English.� Under questioning, Terri confessed.� Cheryl was beside herself, and livid with
Terri.� The maid and her cousin went
home, Billy was sent to his room, and Terri was made to stand in the corner of
the kitchen with her hands on top of her head while Cheryl and Evelyn drank
coffee, chain smoked their Tareytons and Marlboros, and debated Terri�s fate in
right front of her.� 

&nbsp;

�Whatever punishment she gets� I thought, �it still wasn�t
going to be fair.�� After all, these
ladies weren�t going to give Billy the same privilege of humiliating
observation that Terri got the day before.�
I fumed as I recalled the lying little bitch giggling at my circumcised
brother�s weenie as it danced to the rhythm of Evelyn�s butt strapping.� And that had been nothing to Dad�s fierce,
dripping wet, pulled-from-the-tub paddling.�
But my anger quickly turned to glee as my exhausted Dad, having taken a
few hours of sick leave to get off early, walked in the kitchen door.� �There is a God� I smirked.� 

&nbsp;

Within minutes Cheryl was pulling down Terri�s shorts and
panties in front of Evelyn, Dad, and me.�
I couldn't have been happier to see the little bitch cry as her Mom
bared her smooth girl crack in front of my middle-aged father and his young
wife. As the preteen stood there getting stripped from the waist down, Cheryl
told Dad the maid�s story and then, it my surprise, offered him the
honors.� Without saying a word Dad went
to the basement and retrieved his ping-pong paddle, the same one he had used to
blister Billy�s bare butt the night before.�
For me, it was sweet revenge.� By
the time Dad walked back upstairs, paddle in hand, Cheryl had stripped her
daughter completely naked.� Terri was in
tears.� Dad looked at them both, then pointed to the living room sofa.

&nbsp;

Cheryl positioned Terri on the sofa on her back, then firmly
grabbed her legs and pulled them up to her chest, placing her in the diaper
changing position. She held the legs up tight as Dad moved in and paddled
Terri�s bottom about ten or fifteen times as she wailed and cried.� Frustrated with her wiggling, Dad finished by
pulling the naked girl over his lap and paddling her good
another ten times or so. �

&nbsp;

I was mad at Terri and thought Dad had gone too easy on the
cruel little liar.� I wanted her to have
more, or just maybe, I was jealous of the attention she had garnered from
Dad.� Later that night, as I lay in bed
and experienced for the first time glimpses of S&amp;M and B&amp;D thoughts, I
remember thinking about watching Dad spank Terri, and I wondered �Had Mom not
divorced him, had I grown up with him my Dad, would he have punished me like
that?� Would he have stripped me bare in
front of he and Mom and paddled me until I cried?�� I fell asleep that night masturbating to
thoughts of spying glimpses of my strong, handsome Dad, wet and naked in the
shower.�

October 1976

�

The domestic incident with the fish tank seemed to bring
Evelyn and I closer and we held more personal, often
intimate conversations while Dad was away at work.� 

&nbsp;

During one of these conversations Evelyn was shocked to
learn that I, an attractive 19-year-old female living in the middle of the
free-love era of the 1970�s, didn�t take birth control pills.� After all, everyone was sleeping around, and
AIDS didn�t exist then.� She insisted
that I make an appointment with her gynecologist to get them, but I resisted.� I told her I didn't need them because I
didn't have a boyfriend at the time, but she said �once you get one, it�ll take
two months to get an appointment, and then another for the pills to take effect, and besides, my OB-GYN is real cute.�� 

&nbsp;

Despite her persistence, I didn�t make the appointment, not
right then anyway.� The bottom line was,
at 19, I was embarrassed to tell her that I had never had a pelvic exam, and I
was shy and too embarrassed to go for one. And, looking back, I was too na�ve
to wonder why this woman was pushing me to get on the pill. As I reflect back
on those days, I get angry when I think that Evelyn may have had another motive
for her persistence, a devious one.�
Anyway, I eventually gave in to her persistence to go on the pill, but
I�m jumping ahead of my story.� I�ll get
to that in a minute.�� 

&nbsp;

One day Cheryl, Evelyn and I were sitting in the kitchen,
and I remember being shocked at Cheryl�s frankness in sharing her gynecologist
experiences with us.� As she lit one
cigarette off the butt of another, she recanted going in the hospital to have a
�D and C� a few years earlier and, to my embarrassment, explained in
graphically detail of being stripped naked by a nurse and then having her
�pussy clean shaved� for her doctor.�
Seeing my surprise, Evelyn told a similar story of being shave down there for her doctor as well.� Cheryl went on to say that she had had an
abortion since her divorce, and they shaved her for that too.� �Standard practice� she told me, and it
probably was in those days.

&nbsp;

While the conversation surprised me at first, I didn't feel
it was �over the edge�, but when the subject topic changed to spanking, of
adults, I thought it was getting uncomfortably weird.� Evelyn told us that my father occasionally
spanked her for �infractions� around the house.�
My jaw dropped at the way she matter-of-factly said it, as if it was
normal, or even appropriate.� She seemed
to accept the punishment, and even went on to say that she �probably deserved
it.�� I was shocked that my father would
spank a grown woman, but it was just the first of several �shocks� I would
endure over the next few weeks.

&nbsp;

During one of our kitchen girl-gab sessions a few days
later, I asked Evelyn to tell me about a subject which my mother back in Texas
had always held taboo; the real reason why my parents had divorced.� I was trying to see if Evelyn would admit to
having anything to do with it, that is, would she admit that she was seeing my
father while he was still married to my mother, as I suspected.� I had a strong suspicion that she had been a
teenage home-wrecker.� The answer she
gave wasn�t what I expected, but shocked me none the less.

&nbsp;

&quot;I don't know how to tell you that us politely,
Jill&quot; Evelyn said, &quot;but honey, well, your dad is, is, well, endowed.� VERY well endowed.&quot;

&nbsp;

Despite being floored by her answer, I didn't exactly know
what dad�s cock size had to do with my parent�s divorce, and I asked her as
much.

&nbsp;

Evelyn responded by saying, quite frankly, that my dad had
�such a huge cock that your mother just couldn't take it, Jill,� adding �She
refused him and, well, you know Jill, a man needs sex honey, that�s what they
get married for, physical love, and your mom refused him hun.� He was just too huge for her.&quot;

&nbsp;

My head went spinning.�
I was beside myself.� �Was that
why mother had shied away from men for so many years?� I wondered.� Was that why she had screamed and cried so
ferociously when Ron made loved her?�
Could a petite woman like mom really be physically too tight to
accommodate a really hung guy?� I kept asking myself.

&nbsp;

Placing another dry plate in the cupboard I turned to Evelyn
after a minute of uncomfortable silence and asked &quot;Is dad really that
big?&quot;� My bluntness even surprised
me. Before she could answer I added &quot;How about you Evelyn, is, is he too
big for you?&quot; 

&nbsp;

Evelyn just smiled as she tapped her cigarette against the
ashtray, then tilted her head back and exhaled a long stream of smoke.� Her gaze then looked straight back at me as
she asked �How many boys have you been with, Jill?�� The casual frankness of her inquiry surprised
me.� �Just one� I modestly told her. She
smiled again.

Evelyn seemed to take pleasure in telling me that dad was
indeed big for her too, but not too big, and she loved �being taken� by my dad,
as she put it.� �He�s thick, but I love
it.� Evelyn went on to describe making love to dad as if it were a
transcendental experience. She said that when dad made loved her she would let
go, screaming and crying with great release.�
I asked her why, then, had I never heard them making love, and she said
that it was because they only had intercourse �at the cottage.�� It was the first time I had heard anyone in
the household mention a cottage, the getaway Evelyn claimed she and dad used to
facilitate their trysts. 

&nbsp;

That afternoon, in addition to hearing about my father�s
apparently legendary fat dick, I was stunned by yet another revelation, that
Evelyn and my dad owned a cabin in the foothills of the Cascades.� �It�s an old hunting lodge� she said,
describing its remote location about a 45 minute drive� from our home. 

&nbsp;

It was a strange afternoon for me, and for the first time I
felt homesick for my mom, my stepfather Ron, and friends back in Texas.� After that conversation with Evelyn I never
looked at my father quite the same again.�
�So mom really couldn�t take it?� I asked myself over and over.� I guess I'd never know for sure, because I
wasn't about to ask dad, and mom surely wasn't going
talk about it.� It was something that I
wished Evelyn had never mentioned, but I was excited to find out all about the
cottage.

&nbsp;

November 1976

&nbsp;

About two weeks after Evelyn revealed the existence of �the
cottage�, she and Dad offered to drive me up into the Cascades for a weekend
visit the mountain retreat for the first time.�
Dad apologized for not telling me about it sooner, but he claimed he had
been so busy at work that he forgot.�
Ever since Evelyn had told me about the place I was curious and excited
about visiting it.� Coming from
relatively flat, dry Texas, the Cascades
were a fascination I longed to explore.�
Billy was left behind to spend the weekend with Cheryl and Terri, and
Dad, Evelyn, and I headed into the mountains in dad�s International.� 

&nbsp;

Dad and I talked on the drive up, and I finally felt we were
bonding as a father and daughter, connecting in a way I had always dreamed of
when I was growing up. Evelyn napped as we chatted quietly on the peaceful
ride, and as Dad�s four-wheel-drive truck negotiated the rural mountain road I
didn�t see another vehicle pass us in either direction.� We eventually turned off the hardtop onto an
rural gravel mountain road and noisily rambled along it for about a mile before
we turned onto the cottage�s long, rut-worn� driveway which stretched about three
blocks into the forest.� Trees towered on
either side of the narrow passage.� 

&nbsp;

The cottage was truly isolated, and as we slowly jostled
down the dirt drive the wood-sided lodge came into sight.� My first thought was �well, so this is where
Evelyn can scream at the top of her lungs and no one can hear.�� Strangely, the sight of it, knowing this was
the special place were my father fucked Evelyn�s brains out made me horny.� To be honest, I was turned on just by seeing
the place.

&nbsp;

The place was indeed very remote, with no other cabin for
nearly a half mile. The cottage was a rugged and primitive yet beautiful, and I
was surprised when I first saw it because it wasn't really a cottage, but an
old hunting lodge with several bedrooms and a large great room with a huge
stone fireplace which rambled up through an open gabled ceiling.� The long driveway set the lodge deep into the
forest.� I instantly liked the place.

&nbsp;

That afternoon, after showing me around the cottage, Dad
drove Evelyn to a small mountain village about five miles away so she could
pick up a few grocery items she had forgotten to bring from home.� I told them I would stay behind and study, as
I had a test that Monday.� After they
left, curiosity took hold of me and I began snooping around, poking my nose
into every nook and cranny of the cottage.�
In Dad and Evelyn's room I came across an old shoe box in the
closet.� As I lifted the lid, I wasn�t
particularly surprised to find the box full of old Polaroid photographs, but on
closer examination, many the pictures were of Evelyn nude. But that was just
the beginning.

&nbsp;

As I flipped through the stacks of Polaroids,
I found pictures of Evelyn in bondage.�
At that time I didn't know anything about bondage or �the scene� and was
shocked.� There was a picture of Evelyn kneeling
naked, her arms handcuffed behind her back. In another she stood naked, hands
atop her head. In others Evelyn was suspended by her wrists, her feet spread
apart on the floor. In the suspension photos Evelyn was appeared to be in some
sort of large commercial workshop, possibly a logging mill. �In still another photo she was in the woods,
tied spread-eagle between two trees. �As
I stared at the Polaroids, I was in total shock.� Did my father enjoy doing this to her?� Did she enjoy having it done to herself? I was beside myself. 

&nbsp;

As I flipped through the huge stack of homemade porn I came
across a photo which shocked me to the core. It was a photo of� Evelyn and Cheryl together. Evelyn was
completely naked and Cheryl was wearing only a skimpy nightgown top. Both of
them were standing next to each other, facing the camera, their hands resting
atop their heads. They stared straight ahead, and neither was smiling.� Each appeared to be sporting a shaved or
closely trimmed pussy.� I was beside
myself as I wondered �who took this
shocking photo?�� �Was my father there
with both of them?� I wondered.

&nbsp;

Even more shock was yet to come. As I dug deeper, there were
photos at the bottom of the box showing Evelyn with her arms tied spread-eagle
to the four posts of a bed.� I looked up from
the closet floor I was stunned to see it was the bed in their cottage
bedroom.� Suddenly fear froze me as I
thought I heard the truck in the driveway. It was a false alarm, but as I
jumped up I felt my labia flood with wetness. I was embarrassed at my own
excitement, though at the same moment I was paralyzed with the fear of being
discovered as I returned to the photo box.��


&nbsp;

To shock me even more, the next photo was of my Dad
completely naked.� His cock, even
semi-hard, was huge, just as Evelyn had said, and not just long, but really
fat. I have to be honest, I was excited to see my
somewhat estranged Dad naked, his fat dick glistening with pre-cum.� The next photo showed Evelyn kneeling, her
hands obediently behind her back, taking Dad�s cock into her mouth.� She had to drop her jaw wide open just to get
the plump, swollen, rouge-colored head into her mouth.� Dad was shirtless and his pants and underwear
were at his ankles.� A thought hit me;
who was taking the photo?� Cheryl? I
flipped through more pictures of the blow job from different angles. I have to
admit that seeing pictures of Evelyn blowing Dad, with his huge erect cock in
her mouth as she stared up into his eyes, really turned me on.� By now my pussy was dripping wet.� 

&nbsp;

In the next set of photos they were on the bed and Dad had
mounted her, pulling her legs up with her ankles wrapping his neck. �Just seeing the expression on Evelyn�s face as
Dad�s fat, hard dick penetrated her was so exciting to me that I reached down
into my 1970�s style �hot pants� and began to masturbate, first dipping into my
pussy to drag some slick lube up to smear it over my erect clit.� I stared at the picture as I circled my clit
with my index and middle finger.�
Evelyn�s faced looked as if she were crying to the deep strokes of Dad�s
log.� In that moment I wonder if what she
had said about my parents, about why they divorced, was really true; was Dad�s
huge cock just too big for Mom.� I
exploded in a deep, long, moaning organism as I collapsed onto the bedroom closet
floor in stiffening spasms.� As I lay
there, spent and aching for a cock inside me, I heard the truck pull into the
gravel driveway.
