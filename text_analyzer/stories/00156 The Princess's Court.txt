              The Princess�s Court 
                  Part 1 of 5

(FM/Ff nc) 

	Jessica Aldryn McLangly, Lady of the Hierarchy of 
the Moon, Daughter of Lord McLangly, was riding in the 
meadow that lay to the south of her estate, when Lance 
Corporal  Roland came for her.  She was by herself and 
already in a bad mood when she saw him.  She pulled her 
mare to a stop and waited impatiently for him to come 
close enough to explain his presence.  
	"Lady McLangly,"  He pulled up on the reins as he 
came along side her.  "I�ve come here on official 
business from Princess Katherine Ryan�s Court.  I�ve 
been asked to secure your cooperation in an important 
matter."
	Jessica stared at the empty field, pointedly not 
acknowledging him as anything more than a tool of his 
mistress.  It was a beautiful day.  She looked across 
the sea of high grass to the forest, a few hundred yards 
away.  It was a dark, tangled wood, interesting and 
treacherous.  She thought of various, rather caustic 
replies she could make.   Maybe, "Princess Katherine can 
bite me. . ."  or, "I�d love to cooperate with Princes 
Katherine, but I�ve already promised to cat-sit for a 
friend. . ."  But that would be a mistake.  No matter 
what their history, Katherine was the Princess now and 
antagonizing her was out of the question.  "What 
matter?" She asked, keeping her voice cold.
	"She has asked, in order to take her 
responsibilities seriously, that anyone with. . . 
personal knowledge of. . ."  He hesitated.
	Still looking away, Jessica swallowed.  No, she 
thought.  No, it couldn�t be. . .  She glanced at the 
soldier.  He was young.  Maybe a few years younger than 
her twenty, but he held himself with a professional and 
confidant bearing that she found attractive, despite 
herself.   Relax, she told herself.  It�s something 
else.
	"Violations of the Great Contract come to the 
court." He finished.
	Shit.  That bitch wouldn�t!  Jessica felt the 
sudden stab of fear in her chest.  "What does this have 
to do with me?"
	His expression was almost apologetic.   But it 
wasn�t.  "She has asked that you testify under Compelled 
Oath about your knowledge of any such things.   Her 
Court will be holding hearings this night, and I have 
been given a transportation spell to return us to her 
palace.  You�re to dress for a formal audience and come 
with me immediately."
	Oh, Mercy!   Fear and fury rolled in Jessica�s 
stomach.  She knew that the paleness of her face and the 
faint tremble of her hands would betray her, but she 
couldn�t help it.  Think. . .  Katherine knew, or she 
wouldn�t have risked Compelled Oath.  And that meant the 
questions would be pointed and direct.  And intolerable.  
	"And if I am busy?"
	Roland met her gaze.  "This is a request of the 
Princess, Lady.  It wouldn�t be wise to deny it."
	"Very well.  Then let�s return to the house so 
that I can change.  This is an awful inconvenience."  
The complaining came easy and felt natural.  She was 
certain that he might suspect but he did seem to relax 
when she turned her steed about and rode back toward the 
sprawling mansion.  
	What?  Go inside and slip out the back?  No.  Too 
risky.   Loose him now, then.  Ride like the devil and 
make for the trails.  He might follow her into the wood, 
but he�d never find her in it.  Of course, she�d be 
unable to return.  At least for awhile.  But that might 
give her a chance to bargain.  Katherine,  Princess 
Katherine now, would love the idea of her as a miserable 
fugitive.  It didn�t matter.  Anything was better than 
the Court.
	When the hill became steep and Roland fell back, 
she moved.  Jessica dug her heels in and leaned forward.  
Her mare knew what to do, and she felt her gait become a 
gallop.  
	"Lady Jessica!"  He was further behind her, but 
when she looked back, he was coming up fast.  She didn�t 
look back again.
	"Please!  This is foolish, Mi�Lady," He yelled.  
Annoyed but also concerned.  The chances of someone 
getting seriously hurt in a situation like this were not 
bad and although he wouldn�t be blamed he still, 
clearly, felt responsible.   Screw him, she thought.  
The forest wasn�t far now.  She kept her body low, 
gripping the animal�s flanks with her knees.  Don�t 
think of the future, she told herself.  Look ahead.  
Just get away.
	She heard him behind her.  He was both a better 
rider and had a faster horse, but he was unwilling to 
simply ride up and take her.  She was still a Lady.  And 
she might get hurt.  But it was clear that she�d have to 
be creative to loose him.  
	Seconds later they entered the forest.  Her horse 
knew the trail and his didn�t, but he was close enough 
to stay on her.  She heard him curse, as branches, bent 
by her passing, whipped back at him.  The forest was 
dark with a deep-green tint to it, and confusing.  She 
would normally go straight, and come to a clearing, but 
not today.
	Jessica risked a look back, saw that he was, 
despite everything, still close, and turned sharply.  
The horse went but she didn�t.  The world turned upside 
down as she fell.  She didn�t even feel like she had 
hit something.  She just felt numb and then scared.  
When she opened her eyes, Roland was beside her, 
kneeling in the tall grass.
	She was laying, with her head resting on his 
folded coat, looking up at him.  They were still in the 
woods, and she couldn�t make out the expression on his 
face.  "Do you hurt?"  He asked.
	Ache?  Yes.  Everywhere.  Hurt?  No.  She tried to 
sit up, but he didn�t let her.  He directed her to move 
her arms and legs and neck, and when everything seemed 
to be in order then he helped her sit.  Roland offered 
her water from a skin on his horse.
	"You�re lucky," He said.
	She looked away.  The thrill of being alive and 
unhurt had faded quickly.  She had been caught, and her 
pathetic escape attempt was going to be damning.  
Jessica realized that, for the first time in many years, 
she felt like crying.  
	"I guess this means you�re guilty," He said as he 
put away the water.
	"It was nothing.   Please!  This is. . . this is a 
settling of old scores.  It�s just political.  Please 
let me leave, and I promise it won�t haunt you."
	At first he didn�t look at her.  Then he did.  
Calmly.  Matter-of-factly.  She felt her hope dry up and 
crumble.  "I can�t."
	"Just tell them I escaped!  Please!"  I can�t 
believe I�m begging him, she thought.  Oh, Mercy!  This 
was a nightmare, already.
	His smile was very, very slight.  "I�m afraid 
they�d never believe me."  He reached out and brushed 
a strand of hair from her face.  Then his hand lowered 
and took hers.  It was a very firm grip.  "Come on, Mi� 
Lady."  She let him lead her back to their horses but 
instead of mounting his steed, he took a coil of cord 
from his saddle bag.  "What did you do?" He asked.  
Curious.  Not even fascinated.   Probably having a hard 
time believing that someone like her could be guilty of 
breaking the Great Contract.
	"I. . . I�ve been involved with Human�s dreams."
	He looked up.  "Really?"
	"It was. . ."  She sighed, exasperated.  "It was 
nothing.  Katherine did much worse when we were in 
school together!"
	"Princess Katherine," He corrected automatically.  
Then, "Nothing?  Would the Enforcers have thought it was 
nothing if they�d caught you?"
	No.  Of course not.  It was dangerous and selfish 
and very, very bad.  It was also incredible fun.  She 
looked away.  "I wouldn�t have gotten caught."
	"I can see you�re a master of escape.  It sounds 
like you deserve this.  What makes you think you�re 
being picked on?"
	He was weaving a noose.  He took her right hand 
and then her left, and slipped them through the loop.  
He pulled it tight, and she felt her captured flesh 
press together.  It was dark here, but she knew he could 
still see the blush.  "You. . . you�re going to take me 
back to my house like this?" Her voice was very soft.  
She was thinking of what the servants would think when 
they saw their lady marched before them in disgrace.  
Her chin trembled at the very idea.
	"No, Mi�Lady.  I�m going take you back to the 
Court like this.  I�m afraid I�m not letting you out of 
my sight."  Again, he was almost apologetic.  Again, he 
wasn�t quite.  And, she thought she detected the 
faintest trace of amusement in his manner.
	Mercy. . . Oh, please. . . don�t cry!  Whatever 
you do, don�t cry. . .  She swallowed and swallowed 
again.  He lead her, walking slowly, holding the cord 
like a leash.  "You can�t," She moaned, when she 
couldn�t take it any more.  "I can�t appear before them 
like this!  Not. . . oh, mercy.  . ."
	He stopped.  "You shouldn�t have tried to run 
away.  Look, Mi�Lady, I�m sorry.  I�m not trying to make 
things difficult for you.  If you escape do you know 
what they�ll do to me?"
	She looked up.
	"They have a post in the Palace Garden where the 
Ladies of the Castle come to take tea.  They�d tie me 
there, and provide little whips and nettles so that the 
women could make sport of me for a day or two.  And 
then, maybe, they�d find something else to punish me 
with.  I�m not going to risk that.  You got yourself 
into trouble, now you will have to deal with it."  
	He gave the cord a tug, and she followed him, 
mutely out into the sunlight.  The horses had followed 
them.  He sent hers home, and pulled his close.   "The 
spell takes a few minutes.  Then we�ll be back."
	She looked down at her boots and riding dress.  
Her face, utterly devoid of makeup.  No jewelry.  She 
felt ill with the idea that Lady Katherine would be so 
pleased to see her so humble.   And tied!  She wondered 
if the Princess had intentionally chosen a handsome 
guard to collect her.  Probably.  Anything to make her 
humiliation more poignant.  She had to try again.
	"I. . . I knew Katherine at Finishing School," She 
said.  "That�s what this is about."
	"Oh."  But he was interested.  And he believed 
her.
	"She was popular.  Everyone knew she�d be 
something spectacular.  I don�t think anyone really 
thought she�d be a princess, but. . ."  She shook her 
head.  "I was a bit of a rebel.  She and her friends 
could make my life miserable, but she couldn�t control 
me.  She always resented that."  Jessica looked away.  
Katherine had sent her an invitation to her coronation 
some months ago when it had finally become official.  It 
had glittered and burned with a magical fire.  
	Jessica had torn it up.
	"So that�s what this is about?" He asked.
	She nodded.
	"You�re in trouble, then."
	A little more silence.  "I know," She said.
	"You�re not the first one they�ve tried.  Did you 
know Andrea Connor?"
	Jessica looked over.  "Andrea?  Mercy. . . what 
did they. . ."
	"The same thing.  Dream meddling."
	Shit.  Oh, shit. . . She gulped.   Andrea had been 
one of Katherine�s friends.  But also a competitor.   
Jessica had found her far less vile than her associates.  
"What did they do to her?"
	"They�re still doing it," He said.  "She was tried 
two days ago.  Her sentence will last a year.  For most 
of it she�ll be doing domestic work around the palace as 
a common servant but Katherine wanted her humiliated as 
part of her punishment. . ."
	"What?" She asked breathlessly.   "Roland, what 
did they do to Andrea?"
	"You�ll see," He said.  Then everything sparkled 
and changed.  They were in the court.

	It was a round chamber with high walls and stained 
glass windows.   The floor was polished marble.  The 
supports, that ran up to the pointed ceiling, were 
inlaid with gold leaf.   Laid out like numbers on a 
clock, the Thrones sat at 12.  They were intricate and 
magnificent beyond imagining.  There was a worn rug for 
supplicants to kneel on.
	At three and nine, were the galleries, where the 
Counts and Countesses and Dukes and Duchesses would sit 
and observe.  They were filled, and she had the 
impression of flowing robes and imperial dresses, but 
there was too much for her to take in for her to get the 
details.  Behind her (although she didn�t look), was the 
entry way for people such as her, and the Great Hall.  
It was flanked by armored guards.  There would be no 
more nonsense here.
	The architecture was designed to make a visitor 
feel very small, and it was remarkably effective.  She 
looked up at the dizzying heights and the stone and the 
metal and the glass work, and she felt dwarfed.  Under 
normal circumstances, it would have been gut-wrenching, 
but today, there was something that made it even worse.
	Beside  each throne, at about eleven o�clock and 
one, there was an upright, wooden wrack in the shape of 
an �X.�  They had shackles for the wrist and ankles.  
The one on the King�s side was unoccupied, and Jessica 
could see a short, smooth wooden dowel, protruding from 
the center of the �X� at slight angle.
	On the Queen�s side, she saw Andrea. The girl was 
naked and mercilessly exposed:  her breasts,  her sex,  
everything!   Jessica couldn�t imagine how long the girl 
had been there, but clearly she hadn�t become inured to 
the situation.  She blushed down to her chest, and hid 
her crimson face against her arm.  She shook with sobs 
of humiliation and wriggled ever so slightly because the 
dowel was tormenting her constantly.  It would be, 
Jessica realized, inside her anus, causing an unending 
sensation of urgency, fullness, and violation.
	The Nixie, which is what they were, have their own 
strengths and weaknesses.  They are sensuous beings 
whose senses are far more acute than humankind, 
magnifying everything for them, including pleasure and 
pain.  They are also physically different.  The females 
have wings that fold into their shoulders or expand 
until they are large enough to envelope them.  The males 
have a tail.  In both cases these �extra� organs are 
sensitive, private, and erogenous in the extreme.
	Finally, they Nixie betray their feelings.  When 
sufficiently aroused, the flesh that can receive sexual 
pleasure glows faintly.  It is usually covered by 
clothing, and so hidden, but mistaken exposure could 
make  feelings be quite embarrassing.  Andrea glowed.  
Tied, as she was, there was no way she could hide the 
light that seemed to come from under the skin of her 
swollen nipples or through the soft fur of the mound of 
her sex.  Her body shown with sweat and Jessica could 
see a fatigue upon her that came from hours of misery 
and humiliation.  But not from pain.  Katherine knew 
that too much physical discomfort would provide a 
welcome distraction from the indignity of her position.  
Ache and corporal punishment could always be applied 
later.
	Roland pulled her forward and hissed, in a 
whisper, "Kneel, Mi�Lady.  And hang your head.  If you 
don�t show proper respect it will be even worse!"
	Jessica knelt on the rug and looked down, grateful 
not to have the squirming image of Andrea before her 
anymore.  It was horrible, and fascinating at the same 
time.  How much would she have enjoyed such a sight if 
she were here on different circumstances?  It would have 
been delightful.   The Court was silent, waiting to hear 
her.
	"The words," Roland prompted.
	She knew them.  She found them somewhere in her 
memory between which fork to use and what sort of gift 
to bring the hostess of a formal party.  "I, Jessica 
Aldryn McLangly, thank Princess Katherine and the Court 
for allowing me to serve them most humbly."  She 
swallowed.  The words felt awful, as though she had to 
choke to say them.  "I beg that you accept my offer of 
service and my eternal gratitude for your. . . gracious 
leadership and. . ."  She was miserable.  She knew her 
voice betrayed her distaste, and anger "magnanimous 
judgment," she finished.
	I will not cry.  I will not beg.  Oh, mercy. . . 
She wiped at her nose.  Her knees were already hurting"
the rug did not provide any protection from the cold, 
hard, marble floor.  
	"Roland,"  The Princess�s voice was clear and 
familiar and filled with good humor, "What is the 
meaning of this?  Bringing one of my dearest friends 
from school before the court in. . . common clothing and 
tied?  Are you seeking a whipping, because I assure you, 
if punishment is what you desire, you need only ask.  
Unless your explanation is very good, you shan�t enjoy 
what you�ll receive for this."   It was the same old 
Katherine.  Mocking, playfully cruel and sure of her 
authority.  Intolerable.
	"I beg the court�s forgiveness, and I throw myself 
upon your mercy, My Princess," Roland said, the tone of 
his voice making it clear he had nothing to be concerned 
about.  "When I asked Lady Jessica to come with me, she 
felt she had more pressing business in the forest.  I 
was unable to convince her of the importance of her 
testimony here, and so I must confess I forced her 
obedience.  I submit to whatever punishment the Court 
feels appropriate."
	There was a burst of conversation.  Some laughter.  
Some chatter.  Jessica thought she recognized, perhaps a 
dozen voices.   It was like a Finishing School reunion, 
she thought.    Katherine let them talk for almost a 
minute before she silenced them.  "Jessica," She said, 
and when addressed, Jessica looked up.  It was required 
that you face the speaker. She couldn�t bring herself to 
meet Katherine�s eyes.
	"My Princess?" Her voice sounded like a quiet 
squeak in the vast chamber.
	"Is this true?  Surely not!  Deny it, and I will 
have this villain pilloried for a week and paddled 
thrice a day for the entertainment of the Court!"
	She thought of lying.  The thought of Roland being 
punished appealed to her greatly, but it was really only 
a game.  She stayed silent, trying to think of some way 
out of this, but finding nothing.  Throw herself at 
Katherine�s feet, she decided.  Beg.  Supplicate 
yourself!  But surely Andrea had done that and more, and 
it clearly hadn�t helped.  Flee?  Cry?  She trembled.  
She wanted to stand up or at least shift position so her 
knees would stop hurting.  But if this, this least of 
all discomforts, was too much for her to bare for five 
minutes, how would she bare being tied to a wrack such 
as the one Andrea languished on?  She tried to imagine 
hours of such a fate, and couldn�t.  It was unthinkable.
	"Well?"
	"I don�t deny it, Princess," She said softly.
	There was another erruption of voices.  
Exclamations of surprise.  Titters of disapproval.  
Excited speculation about what this might mean.  Jessica 
would have cried, and almost did, except she still 
couldn�t bring herself to give them the pleasure.  But 
the pressure of the withheld tears settled in her 
stomach and made her feel weak and sick.  She bit her 
lower lip and waited.
	Again, at a motion from the Princess, the court 
fell silent.  "I am rather disappointed in you, Jessica.  
I�m afraid that by disobeying Roland in his official 
capacity, you have disobeyed me.  You realize that this 
leaves me no choice but to punish you?"
	She wasn�t disappointed at all!  She was ecstatic.   
When she had imagined bringing her old enemy before her 
she had probably never dreamed it would be this 
dramatic.  Jessica covered her face with her hands and 
stifled a whimper.  She wasn�t going to make it any more 
enjoyable for them!  She wasn�t!  She would be stoic and 
cool and. . .  She felt her body shudder visibly with a 
silent, wracking sob.  
	Snatches of conversation from the gallery reached 
her, �oh, the poor thing. . .�  and, �she�ll be a very 
sorry young lady.  . .�  Their patronizing sympathy was 
a mortifying torment.  
	�She�s going to get it worse than Lady Connor,�
	�I�m sure proper punishment will improve her 
greatly. . .�
	She heard Roland�s voice in her ear, "You must, 
Mi�Lady.  The Princess is waiting."  You must beg the 
court for punishment, he meant.  His tone made it clear 
he knew how awful it was to be toyed with so, but he was 
also reminding her that, if she didn�t submit, they 
would do something even worse.  She wished desperately 
she had the courage to defy them, like she had in 
school.  But she didn�t.  She was terrified of being 
humiliated the way Andrea had been.
	"I b-beg the. . . Court. . . discipline me for my.  
. ." She searched for words that would please them, 
"Disobedience," she finally said.  It was the worst 
way to put it she could think of and she hoped that 
a display of humility might convince them to spare her.
	"The Court is always glad to grant your wishes," 
Katherine purred.  "Roland, please take Jessica to a 
holding chamber.  She�ll be testifying tonight, and I 
want her rested."  She addressed Jessica then, "The 
Court will deliberate on your punishment.  You may take 
comfort in the promise that it will be extremely 
educational for you, whatever we decide."  She nodded 
and dismissed them.  Roland helped her up and lead her 
away.  She walked unsteadily, and her vision was blurred 
with tears, but as she left, she met Andrea�s eyes and 
shuddered.

	The holding chamber was a jail cell with 
comfortable furniture.  It had a heavy wooden door with 
a locking window on it so that the guards could look in.  
There was a bed and a chamber pot, and a water pump.  
The first thing she did was strip off her riding boots 
and message her feet.  She knew she should rest, but she 
couldn�t.  She also spent several minutes squatting 
above the pot before she gave up.  The idea that, at any 
moment, someone might peek through the window was enough 
to insure nothing would happen.  That also inhibited her 
from masturbating.
	The casual exposure of Andrea�s arousal had made a 
big impression on the Young Lady.  She didn�t know if 
the girl had been. . . touched. . . or somehow 
stimulated (even the euphemisms gave her chills), but 
she was certain that if they chose the same fate for 
her, none of that would be necessary.  Right now, 
despite everything, her nipples throbbed and glowed in 
the tight, protective confines of her riding bra.  Her 
panties were wet with sweat from her morning exercise, 
but they were also stained with moisture from her sex.
	The court would love that, she thought.  She paced 
the room, trying to think of something other than what 
she had seen and what awaited her.  Sometimes she 
panicked, but without anything to do, the emotion just 
subsided.  She wished she was able to cry.
	An eternity had passed and another eternity was 
beginning when there came a knock at the door and Roland 
opened it.  She felt the blood leave her face, and her 
throat dried so that her voice was a quiet rasp.  "Is it 
time?" She asked, tremulously.
	"Soon, Mi�Lady.  But not yet.  I came to see if 
you needed anything."  He closed the door behind him and 
sat on the bed.  Reaching under his tunic, he produced a 
metal flask.  "It�s not very strong, but it tastes 
better than water,"  He offered it to her.
	Eyes wide and pathetically grateful for even this 
small comfort she took it and sipped.  Wine, she 
thought.  Wine from a metal flask.  She drank again.  
More like grape cider, really.  He hadn�t been kidding 
when he said it was weak.  She sat on the bed and looked 
down at the floor.  "Thank you, Lance Corporal Roland."
	"I don�t suppose you need me to tell you what kind 
of trouble I could get in for this," He said softly.  
She nodded.  Then she looked at him.  
	"Then why take the chance?  What makes you think I 
won�t tell?"
	"I don�t know if you�ll tell or not.   
I wouldn�t do this if I felt it was immoral, and beyond 
that, I don�t care if it�s against the rules.  You 
looked like you needed some comfort."
	Oh, Mercy, I�m going to cry on his shoulder, she 
thought.   No.  No, I won�t.  I don�t care how good it 
would feel.  I don�t care if all this tension and worry 
is going to make me nauseous .  I�m not going to. . .  
She sniffled, and she felt him put his arm around her 
and draw her head against his chest.  She pressed her 
hands against her mouth to muffle the sounds and shook 
with tears.  She felt him pet her gently.
	"How did you get messed up in this?" He asked some 
minutes later when she was almost through.  Actually, 
she was through, but it felt so good to be held that way 
that she remained there.
	"We all started in school.  Once they taught us 
about the human realm and what sorts of things were 
possible, some of the girls started experimenting."
	"Experimenting?"
	"Entering human dreams.  You�d feel out for a 
dream, and then ride into it."
	"What kind of dreams?"
	She blushed.  "Any kind.  I guess mostly. . ."
	"Erotic ones?"  He guessed correctly.  She nodded.  
Ashamed.
	"That was what Lady Connor confessed to," He told 
her.  "But apparently Lady Connor was still doing it, 
even recently.  And not only entering dreams but 
manipulating them."  He sighed.  "That would not be 
forgiven, if she were caught.  And she confessed to 
using the spells to torment her sleepers.  Giving them 
dreams about punishment and submission.  I don�t think 
Princess Katherine would have been quite as harsh as she 
was if that weren�t the case."
	He waited in silence for her to respond.  His hand 
kept stroking her hair, and down her back, and he held 
her tightly.
	"Well?" He asked, finally.
	"Well then I�m in trouble," She said.  She spoke 
into his shirt so her voice was muffled and he almost 
couldn�t understand her.
	"I can�t say I feel that sorry for you.  No 
offense, Mi�Lady."  He didn�t let go of her though. He 
didn�t push her away.
	She looked up at him, "But I. . . I can�t bare 
this.  I couldn�t bare it if they put me up there."
	"Correct me if I�m wrong, but isn�t that the 
point?"
	"Andrea�s used to this kind of crap!  She was one 
of their. . .  I don�t know. . . one of their little 
soldiers.  I was always too proud to play their stupid 
games."  She pulled away and moved to the edge of the 
bed. She sat, her chin in her hands, her elbows on her 
knees, and glared at the wall.  "This isn�t fair!"
	He didn�t answer.  After a moment she was afraid 
that she might have run him off, but when she glanced 
quickly over, she saw that, while he wasn�t agreeing 
with her, it still bothered him to see her miserable.   
"If you had let me go, I could have dealt with this on 
my own," She told him.
	He stood up.  "It�s almost time and I need to get 
back to my post."  He reached for his flask, "May I?"
	She gave it to him without looking at him.  She 
felt him take it, and the urge to throw her self on him 
and cry and beg that he spirit her out of here flared 
within her.  She was only barely able to control it.  
But he didn�t leave.  "I wanted to say that I know this 
isn�t going to be pleasant for you, but I sincerely hope 
that you learn something from it.  Whatever that might 
be.  I. . . I believe you might need it.  And, I promise 
to help you in any way that�s proper and allowed."
	Silence.  He waited for any response, and when she 
didn�t give one he turned and left, locking the door 
behind him.  
	Alone then, she did cry, face down on the bed, 
sobbing into the pillow.  She reveled in the feelings of 
misery and abandonment, and self pity.   When a knock 
came again, it was Roland, his face expressionless, the 
kindness he had shown her before hidden behind his 
professional facade.  There were two armored guards with 
him, and they escorted her out into the hall.
	Thus, it was, with her face stained with tears, 
her voice broken from hours of sobbing, and barefoot,  
that she was marched before the Princess�s Court.

                 The Princess�s Court 
                     Part 2a of 5 

(FM/Ff nc)


	Lady Jessica could hear the babble of the Court as she approached.  
They had walked her past a mirror and she knew how she looked.  Young, 
without makeup.  She might be mistaken for a teenager!  And utterly 
without class or dignity.  For riding by herself, she had chosen simple, 
old clothes, and had spent the morning sweating in them.  Her tumble in 
the dirt hadn�t done much for her, either, but the worst was that it was 
obvious she�d been crying.  
	If they wanted any evidence that she was intimidated by them, that 
would be it.  She kept her gaze downcast, and shuddered as her bare feet 
slapped the polished stone floor.  The air temperature was comfortable, 
but the floor felt like it was freezing!  
	The only comfort she got from anywhere was Roland�s presence. But even 
that was a double-edged sword.  Being pitied by and disgraced before the 
handsome, Nixie soldier was almost worse than being alone! Under normal 
circumstances, he would be honored, even intimidated, by her presence.  
Now he would always see her as a naughty, deserving child!   He guided 
her through one of the smaller arches that fed into the Great Hall, and 
then into the Court, itself.  It was filled, and she felt the weight of 
the gaze of many, many people fall onto her.   She had determined that 
she would face them impassively, her face set and emotionless.   That 
was impossible when she saw the Princess.
Katherine was magnificent, dressed in a gown woven of clouds and 
star-light, and wearing jewelry sculpted of amber and crystalline fire.  
Jessica felt an almost elemental shock of awe at the sight of her old 
classmate.  Awe, and envy and shame.
	For an instant, their eyes met and Katherine smiled and Jessica looked 
away, shaken.  The Princess enjoyed being admired, she thought.  
Especially by an old enemy in a wretched state.  Her Prince sat beside 
her, his pressed uniform less spectacular, but with the force of 
tradition behind it.
	The room fell silent.  She was lead up to the bar and for the second 
time today, she knelt before her Princess.  She could hear her own 
ragged, edge-of-tears breathing, and she knew that they could as well.  
In the quiet room the small sounds she made were amplified by the hard 
floors and curved walls.  She did not need to look up to know that 
Andrea was still there, still suffering on the wrack at Katherine�s 
side.  If anything, the glow between her thighs had gotten stronger.  
Maybe in anticipation of watching another share her fate.
	Katherine let the silence draw on, undoubtedly aware that every moment 
spent waiting wound her subject�s anxiety tighter.  Jessica didn�t dare 
look up or move.  Beg them, part of her urged.  So what if it�s what 
they want!  They�ll get what they want of you, anyway. . .   But she 
couldn�t do that.  She couldn�t surrender what little she had left to 
Katherine.  And she was afraid.  What if what they wanted was her to 
kneel quietly and suffer their gaze and their pity?  She could imagine 
that.  And then, at their own pace, they�d work up to the other things.
	She shivered and Katherine motioned for the Court to begin session.  
She remembered her Protocol classes vaguely, but from what she recalled, 
there would be a reading of those in attendance.  This was largely for 
the pleasure of the nobles, who would enjoy hearing their name sounded, 
but it might last half an hour.  All the while, she was getting stiffer 
and colder, and her knees were killing her.  The Royal Announcer was in 
the �K�s, reading out, "Lord Andrew Killiam," when she rocked forward to 
try to distribute the weight somewhere else.
	"Be still," Roland hissed.  And it wasn�t an order.  It was a warning.  
She returned to the uncomfortable position, unable to think of anything 
except how comfortable the thrones were.  Even the benches the attendees 
sat on were cushioned.  I must sit still, she told herself.  Head bowed, 
back straight, knees apart.  Just as a commoner would, if brought here.  
I mustn�t shift or move, because they enjoy seeing me like this, and I 
mustn�t deny them anything they might enjoy.  Even if it means going out 
of my mind!
	But when they had read Lady Worthing McAlester, she felt another 
instant of kneeling would do her in and she moved again.  Just a little.  
She had to.
	"Jessica," Roland hissed, but it was too late.
	The Princess held up a hand and the reading stopped.  With the silence 
came a feeling of dread.  Oh, Mercy, she thought, why did I move?  It 
wasn�t that bad. . . She looked up pleadingly.  The Princess smiled at 
her but addressed Roland.  "Lance Corporal, is the Supplicant 
squirming?"
	"Yes, Your Highness," He said.
	"I see.  Jessica?"  Jessica had been holding her breath.  Now, she 
swallowed, exhaled, and gulped air.
	"Your Highness?"
	"You�ve already earned one punishment from the Court.  I cannot imagine 
you want two.  And I know you were better in Protocol than that.  What 
do you have to say for yourself?"
	Mercy, She thought.  She remembered sitting in Protocol class with the 
other girls enjoying the tribulations commoners were put through when 
they visited their betters.  Commoners or disgraced aristocrats. "I�m 
sorry, Your Highness," She managed.  "I t-tried. . ."
	The Princess waved her excuse away, but spoke in a gentle, 
understanding tone of voice.  "You tried your best, didn�t you?"
	"Yes, Your Highness. . ."
	"But you�re not used to kneeling and it�s very uncomfortable, isn�t 
it?"
	Jessica sat perfectly still.  She wanted to cry, �Yes!  Oh, Mercy, 
please! Oh, I beg you, cease toying with me!�  But she didn�t dare.  The 
Princess�s offer of leniency was something she couldn�t pass up, even if 
she mistrusted it.   Her voice quavering, adorably on the edge of tears, 
she managed to say, "Yes, Your Highness,"
	"Well," Katherine spoke to the Court, "I�m not sure what we should do."  
She smiled.  "I think we might ask an expert, such as she is, in proper 
Court etiquette."  She paused to consider and then turned to the girl at 
her side.  Every eye focused on Lady Andrea Conner and the effect was 
immediate.  Miserable enough when she wasn�t the center of attention, 
being called upon in such a manner was merciless torment for the naked 
young lady.  Jessica felt her own breath catch as she looked at what lay 
before her.
	Andrea�s legs were opened uncomfortably wide, and she was raised so 
that her groin was only inches from her Princess�s armrest.  Her hips 
were pushed forward by a wooden rod that disappeared between the soft 
cheeks of her buttocks and into her anus.  Not permitted a stitch of 
clothes, she made a fetching display for the court.  Mortified, she 
blushed painfully, at being addressed, even after all these hours.  
Jessica saw that she was clearly petrified of what this might bring.  
She moaned and wiggled as much as she could.
	"Well what do you think, Lady Connor?  Should Jessica acquire another 
punishment or should we spare the girl?"
	There was some laughter and a murmur of approval.  They found the whole 
idea psychologically fascinating and more than entertaining.  Andrea 
looked away, utterly unable to meet the Princess�s eyes.  Wherever she 
looked, she found a patient, smiling face, waiting for a reply.  
Whispers traveled back and forth, and finally Andrea looked at Jessica.
	Jessica looked down miserable and furious.  Of course the girl didn�t 
have a choice.  If she said anything other than �punish,� she risked the 
Princess�s displeasure.  And the attention of the Court was agony for 
her. 
	"Punish her, Your Highness," She managed, but her voice was all but 
inaudible.  Another murmur from the crowd.  They were pleased!  Very 
good!  The naughty young lady who couldn�t sit still was going to get 
punished for it!  Very proper!  Andrea turned her head to face her arm 
and  whimpered pleadingly to Katherine.  But Katherine wasn�t done with 
her yet.
	"And, tell me, Lady Connor, how should she be punished.  I know you 
favor very sever and humiliating punishments for bad little girls, but 
let�s make sure the punishment fits the crime, shall we?"
	Katherine was certainly entertaining the Court now!  Jessica listened 
to their excited discussions about what fate the mortified Lady might 
choose for her.  They were sure to appreciate the helpless fury she was 
feeling.  After all, playing one supplicant off against another was an 
incredible game!  And the line about �favoring sever punishments!�  Such 
playful irony!
	"Hmm?" Princess Katherine prompted.  "Mustn�t take forever. . ."
	Desperate to have this part of the game over, Andrea babbled something 
out.  "For the Court, Dear," The Queen told her.  "Repeat."
	"M-make her k-kneel on rice. . . And bind her wrists to her ankles. . . 
"
	Oh, Mercy!  No!  Oh, Andrea!  She looked back pleadingly at Roland, but 
he only stared ahead.  There was nothing he could do.  There was nothing 
anyone could do.  A servant boy no older than fifteen came out with a 
bowl of rice, and she was allowed to stand, her head bent forward, while 
he sifted it onto the rug.  She was grateful for the momentary respite, 
but she couldn�t imagine what it would be like to return to the floor.  
A tear escaped down her cheek and she quickly wiped at it.  Soon she 
wouldn�t be able to. 
	"Kneel," Roland told her, not unkindly, but without sympathy.  "It 
could be much worse."
	Owww.  She whimpered herself when her knees touched the grains.   Oh, 
mercy. . . oh, this was terrible. . .  She hung her head and sniffled, 
while Roland tied her.  He was quick about it, but she was basically 
hog-tied.  As when he had lead her in, the ropes were tight enough to 
prevent escape but not so tight she would loose circulation.  He was, 
she reflected, very good at this.
	"That�s much better, isn�t it, Jessica?  Can we continue reading 
without interruptions?"
	"Yes, Your Highness," She said quickly, in a voice that was obviously 
threatening to disintegrate into tears.  Silence.  Why weren�t they 
reading?  Didn�t they know this had to end immediately!  She looked up 
and realized what they were waiting on.  It took all of her self control 
to say, "T-thank. . . th-thank you, Lady Cuh-Connor for my punishment. . 
."
	"And the Court thanks Lady Conner as well," The Princess said.  "Let 
the record show that we have expressed our appreciation."
	Jessica tried to look away, but couldn�t, while The Princess reached 
out and slid her fingers between the furrow of Andrea�s sex.  Andrea 
closed her eyes and begged desperately for it to stop, while her body 
squirmed with pleasure she couldn�t hide.   It was all the more poignant 
that she was almost powerless to pursue her own pleasure.  She was 
spread ever so much wider than was necessary and impaled, so that even 
the most ardent thrust of her hips only gave her what her Princess 
allowed.  Her nipples and nether-lips glowed brightly, and Jessica 
caught a glimpse of the young woman�s clitoris, shining like a bright 
star in the hidden folds of her organ.
	The room was full of mirthful comments about how embarrassing that must 
be and how it was so obvious that she enjoyed it, and of course she 
enjoyed it�she�s obviously needed it for quite awhile!  
	"That�s enough for right now," The Princess cajoled, pulling her hand 
away, and when Andrea struggled earnestly, and implored with painfully 
sincere whispers, the Princess laughed and said, "I know you�re quite 
frustrated, Dear, but it would be so improper to let you spend in front 
of all these people!"  Satisfied that Andrea�s humiliation was complete 
and Jessica�s punishment was just beginning, she let them return to the 
reading.
	It hadn�t been bad before, Jessica thought.  It hadn�t been anything 
before!  Oh, how could she have been so stupid and weak!  This was 
murder!  Agony!  She cried silently because it was the only thing she 
could do but it didn�t help.  She knew they were remarking upon it 
amongst themselves, and she heard, in half-understood voices, their pity 
for her.  The poor, sweet thing was learning her lesson, wasn�t she?  A 
little exercise in self control and submission!  Two subjects she 
obviously needed a refresher in. . .
	And yet this was nothing compared to what Andrea had just endured!  
Tears trailed down her cheeks and she shook and quivered and truly 
suffered every second of the eight minutes it took to finish the list.  
Then there were a few more things to do, and the Princess found this and 
that to bring up, before she could get to the business at hand.
	Jessica was, by this point, physically and emotionally exhausted, and 
miserable, so that she was almost relieved when the Princess addressed 
her directly.
	"You know why you are here.  I was merely going to inquire as to what 
you knew, but given your behavior, I believe we have reason to accuse 
you.  As such, you may enter a plea.  I believe you have been dream 
meddling, Jessica.  What do you say?"
	So  that was it.  They wanted her to confess without having to Compel 
her.   Because if they were wrong they would loose considerable face for 
compelling testimony.    And maybe the Princess was just fishing.  Maybe 
she really didn�t know, and wasn�t going to use the oath at all. . .  
but it went unspoken.  To lie, would bring much greater retribution.  It 
might be her only way out, but if it failed. . .
	She closed her eyes.  If she were to show any meaningful defiance, this 
was it.  If they were to respect her at all, she would earn it now.  The 
Princess had taken a risk by doing this in public, and there was no 
doubt that the Court knew it.  And the payoff?  If she was as cowed as 
Katherine hoped, she would be forced to deliver herself into the 
Princess�s full authority before them all.  Knowing, as Katherine did, 
how hateful that would be for her, it would make the morsel of her 
surrender and subsequent misery even more succulent. 
	She glanced at Andrea and knew that she didn�t have a choice.
	"I plead guilty, Your Highness," she said, her voice quavering.
	There was flat silence, broken only by her own breaths.  Not a murmur.  
	"Guilty?  Are you sure?  The punishment for such a thing is quite 
severe, Jessica," Katherine teased.  In this game of cat and mouse she 
had the mouse right where she wanted her.  Why not rub it in a little?  
	Sobbing, Jessica nodded.  Someone pulled the rope and she was lifted to 
her feet.  Now, with the vast relief of being off her knees, she sagged, 
and moaned.  "Face the front," Roland said.  "You must, Jessica.  
Please."  She did because he asked.  Her vision was blurred and all she 
could see was the great, bright blur of the Princess.
	"Please sentence me," She gasped.  "Please punish me as I deserve. . ."  
She put a hand to her face and cried into it.  Roland supported her.
	When the Princess spoke, her voice was pleased, but oddly gentle and 
lacking the cruelty of her earlier pronouncements.  "Very well," She 
said.  "The Court will adjourn to consider Lady Jessica�s punishment.  I 
will assign. . ."  She looked around the room, "Lord Sopwith to 
determine a punishment for her attempt at flight earlier today  Lord 
Sopwith?"
	A portly man with a dark blue jacket stood and mused, stroking his 
chin.  He spoke loudly so the court could hear his thoughts, "It should 
be something. . . elegant. . . and I think she has apparently been 
coddled more than is becoming, so I would like to see it toughen her.  
And she is exceptionally beautiful when she cries so she should be 
encouraged to cry all night. . .  A rather. . . hmm. . . perplexing 
combination."  He studied her and she found some strength in the 
loathing she felt for him.  He smiled, "Ah.  I have it.  But I must 
confess that it could be more humiliating, I felt that she should be 
spared such," He nodded to the wrack, "public displays until the 
sentencing for her, ahem, real crime."
	He stood, almost at attention, and waited.
	"And that would be?" The Princess asked.
	"Yes, Well. . . I believe there is a balcony beyond your chambers, Your 
Highness.  I felt she might be tied there in some. . . revealing 
position.  And quite naked.  Such bondage will help prepare her for the 
more figurative servitude that will come with her sentence, and to help 
her cry. . .  well, I am sure that some magics can be applied that will 
summons mosquitoes?   But since we wouldn�t want her overly tormented, I 
would like to protect all parts of her body from them except, let us 
say, her buttocks and anus.  Her sex. . . should definitely not be 
spared.  The insides of her thighs?  No.  Let them suffer as well. . . 
and the soles of her feet."  He nodded.  "Such a night should prepare 
her quite nicely for her appearance tomorrow."  He smiled and moved to 
return to his seat when the woman at his side whispered something to him 
and he stood quickly, "If the Court would please, Your Highness, I 
forgot to include, in the list of targets, her breasts.  I cannot see 
preventing the insects from sampling such delicacies."
	Jessica was stunned.  She trembled, and it was good that Roland held 
her because had he not, she would have collapsed.  Her mind reeled with 
fear and anguish.  That was. . .  no.  No, that couldn�t be allowed!  
She turned and looked pleadingly at Roland.  He didn�t look away this 
time, but his gaze told her that she was in fact going to suffer this.  
She felt panic swelling up inside her and she turned to the Princess.  
	"Don�t," Roland said.  "Thank him and be done with it."
	"I can�t," She stammered.  Didn�t any of them realize what agony they 
had consigned her to?   She looked around the room, and found pity and 
sympathy, but also interest and pleasure.  That she couldn�t stand such 
things as kneeling and being tied, made her a perfect plaything.  They 
were eager to see her suffer for them.  And because of that they were 
merciless.  Because these are such minor punishments, she realized.  
Nothing you can�t live through.  Nothing that will harm you.  And your 
fear of them is a heady elixir!  Just look at how Andrea glows at the 
thought of it! And under their dresses and gowns and suits, they are all 
bright as well!
	"Jessica," The Princess said, "I think that was an excellent idea.  
What troubles you?  Do you feel you need something more severe?"
	"P-please. . ."  She trailed off.  Katherine glared at her and she 
shank back.  This was not the time to plead.  That was not what they 
wanted from her.  And she was taught that.  
        "Very well, then.  Lance Corporal Roland, when you tie her, we 
will provide a solution of sugared water that you are to apply to her 
nipples but not the rest of her breasts, her clitoris, but not the rest 
of her sex, and the opening of her anus.  That way those areas will 
suffer just a little worse and she will be quite satisfied and thankful 
for her punishment, won�t you, Jessica."
        "Yes, Ma�am," She whimpered, forgetting the proper from of 
address, but using a less formal one that a student might use with a 
teacher.  Katherine seemed pleased and nodded for her to continue, 
"T-thank you, Lord Sopwith. . . I. . ." she looked down and blushed 
furiously.
        More babble.   Sounds of pleasure and approval.   They found her 
fate very appealing and appropriate, and they knew that, while she might 
not be displayed before them, they would certainly look forward to 
seeing her in the morning.  All around, it had been a very entertaining 
and productive evening. 
        "Take her back to her room, but stay with her," The Princess 
told Roland.  "Preparations will be made, and she will be �put to bed� 
as soon as they are ready."
        He nodded once, and took her arm to lead her away.  "And, 
Jessica," The Princess said.  Jessica looked back.  She was so relieved 
to see a normal, almost friendly expression on the girl�s face.  "I 
shall be up to visit you once you are �tucked in,� and we�ll talk."
        Then she was taken away.

		         The Princess�s Court 
                            Part 2b of 5

(FM/fF nc)


         "Awaken, Mi�Lady,"  She heard the voice in her ear, and for a 
moment she didn�t know where she was, but it was wonderful to wake up in 
the arms of a handsome, strong man.  Then she remembered and it wasn�t 
wonderful anymore.  Or rather, it was still wonderful, but bad for other 
reasons.  She looked at him, her wide eyes shining like full moons in 
the dim light of the chamber.
         "Have they come for me?"
         "Very nearly.  A boy came to say the preparations have been 
made."  She had slept almost immediately when they had returned, and he 
had held her the whole time.  Now, newly awake, she felt disoriented.   
She clung to him desperately. 
         "You haven�t much time," He said.  "You must go to the bathroom 
now.  It�s the last chance you�ll get for some time, and you don�t want 
to. . .  make a mess while you�re tied for punishment.  They�ll be very 
cruel if you do."
         She shook her head.  "I can�t," She hissed.  "Not with you 
here."
         "Try," He told her, "Because if you are modest about such 
things, you best get over it.  Do you think they let Andrea down to 
pee?"
         The image she got was devastating, frightening and arousing at 
the same time.  She swallowed and shook her head.  "I can�t do it like 
this."
         "Lady  McLangly," He said, but she grabbed him. 
         "I. . .  please. . . it would be too embarrassing."
         "As you will, but I fear it will only be worse later.  Then 
stretch.  I know there�s not much room here, but do the best you can."
She looked down.  The enormity of what she was facing hung over her so 
that she could take little pleasure in the honest, heartfelt concern the 
soldier showed for her.  Under less trying circumstances, this would be 
wonderful.  As an enlisted man, he was below her station, but not so far 
that such a quick romance would be impossible.  And he was handsome and 
strong. . .
         Which, of course made what he was going to see when they 
removed her clothes even worse.  What would he think of her glow?  He 
would pity her and maybe be relieved that she found some. . . interest 
in this.  The idea of being so exposed to him was mortifying even to 
think of.    When the time came, she would never be able to endure it!          
That was one of the reasons she didn�t dare disrobe now, and knowing 
that she would soon be forced didn�t make it any easier.  Maybe they 
would send him away. . . but that would be even worse!  She cried again, 
and he held her until there were footsteps in the hall.
         "Will you leave me?" She asked him, suddenly.
         "Only if I must," He said as he stood to open the door.  "And I 
shan�t go far."
         The guards returned and this time they took her up to a winding 
stair that climbed into the Palace tower.  From small windows she 
passed, she could see the lands around it.  Magical lands.  Lands of 
wonders. Roland helped her along, and they finally came to a door that 
opened into the carpeted, wood-paneled recesses of the Princess�s 
private quarters.  Here, the air smelt of strange, expensive perfumes.  
She saw masks with odd, frightening and erotic designs and pedestals 
with ancient artwork upon them.  She could feel the magic, like an 
electric charge in the air.  The balcony was past the Princess�s 
quarters, accessible through a large double door.  The air outside was 
warm, and there was no breeze.  She hesitated when she saw the rigging 
they had set up for her.
         It would be like a swing.   She would lay on her back, strapped 
to a leather dolly, facing the sky.  There were two short cords with 
soft leather cuffs on them for her ankles, and they were very far apart.  
Anyone opening the doors would be looking directly into her most private 
recesses.  She didn�t immediately see what would be done with her arms, 
but she was sure they wouldn�t be available to cover herself.
          Directly beneath her was an ornate bowl filled with powdered 
herbs.   A young woman; a servant not yet out of her teens, was 
inspecting the apparatus.    She turned, studied Jessica, and then spoke 
to Roland.  "It�s quite ready for her.  The Princess is having her bath 
and will be finished shortly.  She�s to be in position by then."
         He nodded.  "How so?"
         "On her back, legs up and apart," The girl said.  After a 
little consideration she suggested  "Tie her hands behind her back."
         "Why not up?"  It would be more comfortable, she realized.
         "To expose her breasts more," The girl explained, cheerfully. 
"If they were up she might thrash about and  find some way to protect 
them."
         He nodded finally.  Then he turned to her.  "We haven�t much 
time.  Let�s go.  If you don�t do it yourself, I�ll have to do it for 
you."
         She stared at him and trembled.  "I. . . can I please. . ."
"No.  No, whatever it is," He told her firmly, his voice slightly 
irritated, "You cannot.  Take your clothes off or I shall. . ."  He 
sighed.  "No.  Never mind.  Stand still, or I shall spank you."  He 
stepped forward and took her shirt, lifting it in one move over her 
head.  In that moment, she was close enough to smell him.  He smelled of 
horses and the oil that soldiers put on their swords and the dust of the 
road.  He also smelled her, she realized.  Sweat.  Tears.  Unlady-like 
aromas.  She felt his hands undo her bra, and they stopped.  For a 
moment, nothing happened.
         "Oh, mercy," The girl said, her voice almost a laugh.  "I think 
I�d better go tell the Princess about this."
         "Why�s that?" Roland asked, irritated.  Worried.  Astonished by 
what had been revealed.
         "Well you�re supposed to rub her in. .  . those places."  The 
girl did laugh then.  This was, Jessica realized, quite hilarious, "and 
the way she�s glowing, the Princess might not consider that punishment."
         "Well go tell her then," He said, clearly happy to be rid of 
her.  Jessica heard the girl�s footsteps as she left.
         "Part your legs a bit, Mi�Lady.  I�m going to pull down your 
pants."
         ". . . oh, mercy, Roland. . . please. . . please don�t make me. 
. ."
         Her legs were spread.  He was rough, but no rougher than he had 
to be.  In an agonizing instant, her pants were down around her knees.  
Her panties, too.  And her mind reminded her mercilessly of what he must 
smell now.   Still holding her, he sat down in a chair by the railing 
and in the same motion she found herself across his lap.  She felt the 
rough fabric of his trousers against her thighs and belly.  Against the 
curve of her sex.
        Now she panicked and struggled, but he held her effortlessly, 
turning her here and raising her there.  This couldn�t be happening!  
This was. . . no. . . oh mercy!  Mercy!  She looked back over her 
shoulder and his eyes met hers.  She was, at that moment, all blushing 
mortification and wide-eyed vulnerability.  Her soft mouth begged 
voicelessly for him to spare her, and he gave her a moment to fret and 
plead because it was adorable and he couldn�t help it.  But it didn�t 
sway him.
         The first spank was shockingly painful and made an sharp crack 
that carried into the valley.  She cried out, and he slapped her again.  
His palm was hard and callused, and her buttocks were smooth and soft.  
She was defenseless, she realized, against even the most mild spanking 
she might receive.  
        "You�re not to beg me," He said, letting his hand fall with the 
cadence of the words.  "Or to resist me,"  She  was bucking under his 
hand, and he punished her expertly, letting his hand fall as her 
struggles raised her hips.  "Or to ask to be let out of punishments you 
know you deserve."  
        "Please," She sobbed, "Please, Sir!  Please!"
"Do you understand?" His voice was calm, but the spanking hadn�t slowed.
        "Yes!"  She screamed it, because he wanted her to.  He wanted 
everyone to hear her.  And he let her naked thighs kick and spasm as 
they would because it gained her nothing, and it made a fascinating, 
obscene display of her light pink (it wasn�t even red yet) ass and damp, 
glowing sex.  Because, she thought bitterly, it entertained them and 
made the lesson that much more effective for her.  "Yes, Sir, Yes!  I 
understand, Sir!"
        "So you�ll obey me?" He asked.  Now, though, just a little bit 
of amusement crept into his voice.  He couldn�t have failed to notice 
the desperate increase in the light between her thighs.    Or the heavy, 
musky odor coming from the slick, damp spot on his uniform slacks.  
        "Owww!"  She cried, nodding and then, "Yes!  Sir, please!  I�ll 
obey!  I�ll obey!"  If only you�ll stop!  Oh, mercy, please stop!  There 
was a fire back there, and each slap stoked it higher.  She was bawling 
and wailing so that she was sure everyone heard her everywhere.  It 
didn�t matter.  It matter how humiliatingly submissive she was, because 
she would do anything to stop the spanking.  
        "Even if I tell you to squat and pee in the corner?" He asked.  
She opened her mouth in protest.  Being teased by him now, while she was 
utterly defenseless was intolerable.  Her pride demanded that she deny 
him.  Demanded it!  But she couldn�t because that would mean the 
spanking would continue, and no matter what the loss of face, no matter 
how her sniveling pleading might torment her later, she had to submit.
        So the castle heard Lady McLangly cry, "Yes!  Ow!  Yes, I�ll pee 
in the corner, Sir!  Please!"  He chuckled, but stood her and said 
softly, "Quickly, then.  Do it before they get here," and she almost 
did, but he was a little bit too late.
        "I don�t think that�s a very good idea," The Princess said.  
Roland froze momentarily, and then turned to salute her.  
        "Your Highness," He began, by way of explanation, but she waved 
him aside.  She focused on Jessica.  Jessica felt her throat tighten, 
and she shied away.
        The Princess walked up to her.  "On your knees," She said 
gently.  "Or, if you prefer, you may squat.  But no peeing."  She 
giggled.
        The Princess was wearing a white robe that tied at the middle.  
Washed and cleaned, with her hair tied back, she looked much younger and 
less imperious than she had at Court, but her presence was still 
stunning.  
        Jessica squatted at her feet, her smarting, stinging buttocks 
inches over her heels.
        "Chin up, Jessie," The Princess said.  "Let me look at you."
She looked up at her Princess.  She felt strangely calm, while Katherine 
wiped at her cheeks and smoothed her hair back.  "She�s very tender, 
isn�t she, Roland," The Princess said
        "Yes, Your Highness."
        "And. . . responsive?"
        "It appears so," he agreed.  The topic of the state of her body 
made him uncomfortable.
        "I always thought so.  It�s unfortunate for her," She said and 
then laughed.  "She�s in for a rough time, I�m afraid."
        "I�m sure," Roland said, "She would agree she deserves it."
The Princess looked down.  "Is that true?  Do you deserve it?"
        Jessica closed her eyes and tried to answer, but she couldn�t 
talk.  She nodded her head miserably.
        "I like it when you call me Ma�am," The Princess said.  
"Especially in public.  While you�re being punished you�ll refer to me 
that way, Okay?"
        "Yes, Ma�am?" She managed.
The Princess turned to Roland.  "Tie her and wet her.  I don�t believe I 
need to remind you that she�s not to spend."
       "No, Your Highness," 
       "Oh yes.  Gag her.  I don�t wish to be disturbed by her cries."  
He nodded and got to work.

       She did nothing as he strapped her in.  He was very thorough and 
careful.  She wouldn�t escape, and she wouldn�t fall.  When he was done 
she was helpless.  There was something awful, she realized, about not 
being able to close her legs.  It was. . . improper.  Ever since she had 
been a little girl, she had been taught how to sit and how not to, and 
what was acceptable and what wasn�t.  Laying back, with her ankles 
raised and unbearably far apart was wrong.  Even though she had no 
choice, a merciless voice that sounded just like her Governess scolded 
her, telling her how what a tramp she appeared!  Making her aware of how 
devastating the loss of privacy was.  The light from her sex didn�t 
help. In the darkness, it was a constant reminder of her shameful 
reaction.
        "Now your hands," He said.  He had left them for last.  He 
folded her elbows, so that her forearms were comfortably together, as 
though she were crossing her arms, but behind her instead of in front of 
her.  Two straps buckled them tightly together, under the swing so none 
of her weight was on them.  Just as he finished her nose itched and she 
moaned through the gag.
        "Shh," He told her.  "Quiet, now.  It�s Okay."
No, she thought, pleading with her eyes.  No, it�s not Okay.  My nose 
itches.  I�m naked. . . I�m so humiliated I can�t think.  I need to pee.  
I need to masturbate!  You can�t leave me like this!  I�m not able to 
handle it!
         He watched her writhe as panic overtook her, and then when she 
was done and it had gained her nothing, he sat beside her.  "I�m going 
to wet you now.  I. . . I can see how you�re. . ."  he looked away, and 
his awkwardness was devastating for her.  It confirmed her fear that far 
from taking her arousal in stride, he found it odd.  Interesting.  And 
obviously, shameful in the extreme.  She was deeply embarrassed, and 
knew the Princess would be pleased.  "I�m going to try not to make it 
worse," He explained.
         She couldn�t have been more self conscious if she�d been 
painted red and marched through the center of town!   He sat between her 
open thighs and began to wet the skin indicated.  Her nipples were 
first.  He reached across and touched one lightly with sticky, moist 
finger tips and she moaned.  His hand pulled back.  Then he touched her 
again.  His carefulness and gentleness made his caress teasing and 
almost tickling.  She was so aroused that it was so overwhelming it was 
almost uncomfortable.  She jerked violently and squirmed, but there was 
nowhere to go.  
          Then he did the other nipple.  When she moaned and he 
apologized, she wanted to die.  When he sat, watching the throbbing glow 
in her vulva, she knew he was aware how close to an orgasm she was.  
Touch me, she thought.  Please!  Please, I need it!  She tried to push 
her hips toward him but she was helpless.  He waited until the aching 
glow subsided before he started again.  
          Roland was quick and mercifully professional about her anus.  
His fingers invaded her, leaving the sticky goo in their wake and they 
were gone.  The stimulation reminded her she had to do more than just 
pee, but she couldn�t even worry about that now.  She waited for him to 
touch her sex, but he didn�t.
          My clitoris, she thought helplessly angry at being denied the 
friction she expected.  Oh, Mercy that I�m gagged or I�d beg you!  She 
thought of Andrea being �rewarded� before the court and whimpered.  Why 
wouldn�t he touch her!  Because his quick brush with her anus had 
aroused her again, she realized with horror.  Because he was waiting for 
the near orgasm throb of desperation to subside.  �What must he think of 
you?�  she scolded herself.  �A Lady who gets so aroused she nearly 
spends from having her anus humiliated?  What little respect or care he 
might have had for you will be gone now!  And he�ll enjoy your misery 
along with all the others!�
          She sobbed forlornly.  Finally, she was calm enough to finish.  
With the gentlest touch imaginable, he spread the lips of her sex and 
unveiled her clitoris.  It lit the palm of his hand and shown through 
his fingertip.  She lay there, on the edge of somewhere else as he wet 
it with the stick goo.  Then he was done.
          He stood over her, looking down at her face.  "I have to go," 
He told her.  "I�ll be near."  He stroked her face, trying, with a look, 
to tell her that, no matter how bad it seemed, tomorrow would come, and 
she would be alive and everything, in the big picture, anyway, would be 
OK.  Then he bent forward and kissed her cheek.  It was reassuring and 
wonderful and frightening all at the same time. He stepped away and she 
began to cry uncontrollably into the gag and struggle with all of her 
might.  She heard him kneel and strike a match, setting the contents of 
the bowl burning.

          The bowl, when lit, would produce mosquitoes.  Swarms of them, 
Princess Katherine thought.  She smiled at the image.  Jessica might be 
able to rock back and forth a small amount, but that would be the only 
rebellion she was allowed.  And the night was early.  She had ordered 
the girl gagged so that her cries wouldn�t upset the household, but she 
found herself wondering if that was a bad idea.  Maybe the young woman�s 
moans would a gentle sound to sleep by. . .
          She went out on her private balcony, and looked across at the 
one where the punishment was just starting to take place.  She could 
make out the dark shape of Jessica, her arms crossed behind her, her 
head tilted back, so that the curve of her neck was visible.  The scene 
was only lit by the glow of embers in the bowl, the light-house peaks of 
the girl�s nipples and the reddish luminance of her sex.  That was an 
unexpected pleasure, the Princess thought.  Wouldn�t the court be 
pleased to see it!  They had so enjoyed mocking Andrea and Jessie was 
even more modest.
           Roland had just left, and the darkness rising out of the bowl 
was not smoke, but a tangle of living creatures.  The Princess watched 
the figure start to squirm.  On a moment of thought, when one of the 
dark shapes wandered toward her, she rolled up her left sleeve extended 
her forearm to it, palm up.  The insect hummed audibly, a music she was 
sure would entertain Jessica through the night, and felt like the 
tickling, caress of the lightest paint-brush against the smooth flesh of 
her arm. An extremely irritating and unpleasant tickling, she thought.  
It took every bit of self control she had not to pull away.  But then 
there was a momentary needle-like sting she could not tolerate, and she 
shooed it off.
           Katherine looked at the spot.  It�s bite had left a tiny, 
skin-colored welt no bigger than an eighth of an inch across.  Almost 
invisible, she thought, and she was disappointed.  Then it started 
itching.  She walked back, savoring the sensation, until she reached the 
door of her room and quickly slipped inside.  The itch had become 
intolerable.  She glared at it.  I won�t scratch it, she thought.  Let�s 
see.  No.  No I won�t.
           It seemed to boil under the surface, getting worse and worse.  
The skin, after the initial welt, never changed, but she felt it seem to 
cry out with the need for attention.  She closed her eyes and tried to 
think of something else.  Anything, except the irritation, but soon  her 
whole world was that one, tiny patch of skin that she would do anything 
to scratch.
          So Princess Katherine smiled and scratched it.  She slipped 
into bed.  Her husband would be up with paperwork for another few hours 
but that was OK.  She wanted to think these thoughts alone for a time.  
The welt was itching again, as badly as it had been the first time, and 
she caressed it scratching it lightly.  She thought of the areas 
unprotected.  Such sensitive skin!  She opened her legs and caressed 
herself.  Her thighs.  Her buttocks.  Flesh so meant for the most 
delicate pleasures, so defenseless against even the most minor 
discomforts!  Like an insect bite!  She grinned to herself thinking that 
she was awful!  So wicked, she thought dreamily.  So unbearable.  Her 
hand slipped between her thighs and she began to prepare for sleep.

		The Princess's Court
                    Part 3 of 5

(FM/Ff nc)

	There was no way to tell how long it had been.  
Seconds?  Years?  Jessica looked up at the moon, and 
listened to the terrifying hum of the insects all around 
her.  The spells that protected her only kept them from 
biting her; they didn't lessen their interest!  But even if 
the buzz in her ears or the maddening tickle of wings at her 
neck and ears and all across her naked flesh were all she 
had been scheduled to suffer, it wouldn't have been 
bearable.
	This won't happen, she had told herself, even as the 
cloud of insects had swirled into being.  This can't!  It's 
more than awful!  She imagined that the Princess would come 
through the doors and have her removed, or that Roland would 
appear and. . . yes!  Oh, please!  Didn't they realize that 
this was frightening?  That being tied helpless for the 
night was punishment enough?  That she was not some servant 
wench, used to the whim of her mistress, but a delicate 
lady?
	But then, after the first few tests of her prostrate 
body, she had realized that this was, in fact, going to 
happen.  That for her punishers, comfortable in their fine 
beds, her plight was a pleasant thought, and that they found 
a night of `discomfort' (for that's all they thought it was) 
was a very appropriate penance for a young lady with a 
penchant for running away.  She had screamed to tell them 
that it was already too much!  That she was already so sorry 
and so punished, and Mercy-Oh-Mercy, they must surely spare 
her!  
	But the gag stifled her voice, and only quite moans 
escaped.
	Then she struggled again, feeling that she must 
escape, or die trying.  But the straps held her snug and 
safe, and she neither escaped nor died.
        Finally, her only act allowed was to look this way and 
that, trying to follow individual monsters.  When there were 
a few, this was possible, but soon there were many.  
Hundreds!  And they flew close about her face and lips, and 
the backs of her knees and there was no way she could follow 
even one.
	So it was that Lady Jessica had given up trying to 
focus on the swarm.  Instead, she stared with single-minded 
attention at herself, looking between her breasts, past her 
belly, to the swollen bulge of her sex.  Light from it 
filtered through the soft fur of her pubic hair, 
silhouetting  the parasites as they alighted and departed 
her.. 
	She watched, as one randomly swooped in.  Punished as 
she was, the most important thing in the world was the 
question of what it might do.  Would it fly past?  Oh, 
please!  Or, no. . . her inner thigh, already freckled with 
bites!  Or maybe it would go down, past the horizon of her 
vagina and torment her buttocks, or the cheeks of her anus.  
Maybe it would even venture between those orbs, where a few 
of it's brothers had already been, and add another star to 
the constellation of discomfort she suffered in there!  
Punished little girls, she reminded herself, using the 
mocking tones she was sure they would, were supposed to keep 
their minds on their punishments.  This momentary event 
certainly had her full attention!
	Time seemed to stop as it landed softly upon her 
nether lips, and she thought, `No!  MERCY, no more THERE!  
OH, PLEASE!' and she thrust and struggled  as though if she 
were bit there again, she would perish.  But the creature 
knew it was safe, and her movement didn't amount to much 
anyway, and it fluttered lazily over to a damp, pink fold, 
and drank it's fill, and all the while, she cried into the 
gag and bucked and thrust in a manner that was sexual and 
desperate.
	And then, oh-did-it-itch!  Oh. .. She would give 
anything to scratch that one spot!  Anything at all!  How 
could she suffer this and not go mad, and not die?  None of 
the itches went away.  There were just more and more of 
them.  She learned that the longer the bite lasted, the 
worse the itch.   The more bites in the same place, the 
worse the itch.  These revelations made struggle of some 
kind imperative!
	And so it was.  Such dramas were played every second.  
And most times, there were many attackers.  A cloud of smoke 
around each breast.  A dark, buzzing shadow, thick between 
her thighs.  Two small outposts, visiting her feet, and 
keeping her dancing.
	It was not lost on her, that this torment was designed 
to keep her most erogenous skin continually stimulated.   
The distress kept the entirety of her attention focused, for 
every second, on her sexual regions.  It was so successful, 
that she felt dampness from her sex over-full sex slide 
between her buttocks.  The insects seemed to like her juices 
as much as they appreciated the sugar-water, and they gave 
her lesson after lesson in how sensitive and aware she could 
be of the narrow space between her sex and her anus.  
	She was a slender girl, and her breasts were neither 
too large nor too small for her body, but in the sizzling 
attention of the mosquitoes, they felt huge.  She watched 
helplessly as they swarmed her, finding the undersides and 
the nipples the best spots for their tickling, itching 
assault.  Her nipples already felt swollen tight, making 
them even more vulnerable to the pin-prick stings of the 
creatures.  And all she could do was watch, fascinated and 
horrified, as they took their time with her.
	Her buttocks hadn't fared any better.  If only Roland 
were now here to swat at her pale jiggling orbs!  It would 
be worth it to spare them from the monsters!  But as things 
stood she deeply regretted having earned a spanking before 
suffering this.  Roland had tenderized her far more than he 
knew, and the raw, punished skin reported every bite, ever 
wing flutter, and every new, scintillating welt with 
unfailing accuracy.   She felt their spastic, idiot caress 
as they knitted their punishment across her seat.
	Even  with so many things to worry about, she found 
their torment of her anus especially frightening.  They 
ravished the outer cheeks, but seemed, perhaps, a little 
unwilling to enter such a narrow world.  They needn't have 
feared:  Roland knew her anus was to suffer, and he had tied 
her so that it was open beyond her control.  Still, when 
they did venture inside to partake of her wetted, slippery 
opening, the sensation of itching was so horrible and 
intense that she was afraid she might loose control.
	Loose control and. . .   She tried not to think about 
what merciless stimulation of her anus might lead to.  At 
least on her sex, they had many targets to enjoy, and the 
small opening from which she peed had only been bitten once!
	Tears streamed down the sides of her face, and saliva, 
escaped from her gagged mouth, dripped down her cheek.  More 
small irritations that summed to the astronomical whole of 
her misery!
	Time passed.
	Later (hours?)  she was so exhausted, that despite the 
incessant tickling of her feet she ceased to fight, and they 
hung still.  The moment she made this decision, she was 
suffused with relief at not having to exercise anymore, and 
she honestly intended to endure passively, whatever was 
inflicted.  They tormented her arches, wringing blubbering 
sobs from her, but she did gain two, or maybe three seconds 
of surrender before they discovered the soft webbing between 
her toes!  The ferocious itch was electrifying, making her 
whole body spasm and twist, and somehow, from somewhere,  
she found the energy to resume her rapid kicking.  The 
motion, maybe, discouraged a few of the attackers.
	An instant had passed.
	Eight insects, ignoring her feeble protests, enjoyed 
the fleshy curve of her buttocks.  Their bites reminded her 
where Roland had most enjoyed spanking her.  She was sure it 
could not get worse but when she collapsed exhausted, dozens 
of them, waiting for just such a calm descended on the 
insides of her thighs like hundreds of lover's kisses.
	A second passed.
	Through tear-blurred vision, she watched mosquito 
alighted on her left nipple.  Her left nipple was already 
ablaze with welts upon welts.  She screamed into the gag and 
begged with her eyes, please, oh, please!  Anywhere else!  
And she struggled, not with any hope of protecting herself, 
but thinking that maybe she could convince the creature to 
take another option.  It landed, right where she was afraid 
it would, and needled her for a long, deep drink that left a 
welt which would torment her especially throughout the 
night.
	Seconds passed.  Slowly, they became minutes.  Finally 
hours.  When she guessed, deliriously, that sunrise must be 
soon it was almost eleven thirty at night.  Now she lay 
still.  The body had exhausted itself, fighting with all of 
it's strength and all of her will and there was nothing 
left.  She had thought that, somehow, when this point was 
reached, it might be bearable.  She had imagined that maybe 
she would reach an understanding and be able to make peace 
with the punishment.  But she learned the submission was 
only what was required, and it spared her nothing.  In fact, 
when she lay calm, she discovered how awfully effective her 
small protest had been.  
	Movement, even the small amount she had been allowed, 
had spared her anus and the inner folds of her sex a most 
devastating work out.  It was not even midnight, when she 
found herself opened to the `serious' portion of the 
punishment and her suffering began in earnest.  She could do 
nothing.  Even the most spectacular torment of her most 
delicate sexual flesh couldn't stir her body to protect her.  
She squirmed faintly, watching as the swarm descended 
enmasse, covering the entire crescent of flesh from her 
clitoris to her anus.  As Lord Sopwith had hoped, cried.
	On the first night of her punishment, Lady Jessica 
cried all night.

	Morning finally did come, long after she suffered 
everything many times.  With the first rays of the sun the 
insects were gone, becoming ash, and drifting away in the 
faint breeze.   Although Jessica had imagined this moment as 
a relief of epic proportions,  she found that  misery they 
had left her with did not fade in the least.  But there was 
one mercy.  Without the unending assault she could finally 
surrender to he exhaustion and, after a manner, sleep.
	She remembered a little about when they came for her.  
Mainly that Roland was the first through the door, and that 
he waited impatiently at her side while the handmaids and 
servants and guards of the Palace came by to see how she had 
faired.  Each visitor and even passersby in the hall enjoyed 
the devastatingly intimate view she presented.  There was 
much speculation about the light she gave off, and how badly 
she needed relief from that kind of itch.
	As for the bites, she recalled the loathsome 
handmaid's game of offering to rub her, if only she would 
describe, in great detail, where she most needed it.  In 
this facility, she knew she had been a great source of 
entertainment for the help staff, who had ceased their cruel 
teasing (she was never, once, touched, as per the Princess's 
orders) only when other needs of hers proved more timely, 
and she begged for a bedpan, that she might relieve the 
pressures she had endured all night.
	What before, she could not do in private, she did now 
before an appreciative audience, who understood exactly how 
demeaning it was.  And, afterwards, it was Roland who took 
her away.  He untied her and carried her, cradling her in 
his arms.  She knew she was filthy, and disgusting, and 
should be mortally ashamed of these things, but she so 
needed to be held that she pressed her tear-wet face against 
his neck and slipped back into sleep.
	When she awoke, she knew some but not much time had 
passed.  She was laying on a tile floor, with her hands tied 
to a post above her head, but she was otherwise freed.  She 
looked up at the whitewashed walls and to her left at a 
great, oyster-shaped tub of marble, and she realized that 
she was in the Princess's bath chamber.
	She wasn't alone.  
	"Hush," Roland said, for she had whimpered.  "The 
Princess has demanded that you be brought to her as soon as 
you awaken.  If they discover I've not done so, I'll be 
punished along with you."  She looked at him wide eyed, 
amazed at the simple way he described the risk he was 
taking.  When he knew she understood, he took a basin of 
warm water and a pile of wash rags to the floor beside her.  
"I'm going to clean you quickly.."
	He held her left ankle, bending her knee up to her 
chest, and she felt him place the warm cloth between her 
legs and wash her as though she were an infant.  He cleaned 
her buttocks and her thighs, and the he placed a hand over 
her mouth so that when he wiped her anus and sex, her moans 
would not be heard.  He pretended not to notice the way she 
wiggled, or the noises she made, or the light that betrayed 
the pleasure she felt.  He was fast, but thorough, scrubbing 
hard, in a way that both soothed the itch and was too rough 
to allow her to spend.   When he was done, the agony of the 
bites had faded so that it was still a torment, but not so 
much of one she couldn't bear it.
	"That will be some comfort for you when the Princess 
sends for you," He said.  "I would clean your face, but they 
wish you to appear in Court tonight, sullied by a night of 
tears."  He stroked her hair and offered her water from a 
flask (no wine this time, but water was what she wanted).  
"I can only risk another five minutes."  He looked around.  
"Here.  Let me fold a towel for your pillow. . ." 
	"Why are you helping me?" She managed.  He looked at 
her as though she had uttered nonsense.
	"If you want, I'll deliver the Princess now," He said, 
archly.
	She looked away so he wouldn't see the new tears, and 
he gently brought her head back.  "I'm sorry.  I. . . I feel 
bad for you, and I have no doubt that even with my help, 
you'll get all the punishment you need."
	"They can't mortify me publicly!  Not like Andrea!  
Oh, mercy. . . I could never stand it. . ." He held her, but 
he did not agree.
	"Do you think I deserve this?" She asked, and he 
simply nodded.   He was a disciplined, professional soldier, 
she thought bitter and impressed.  He would never find 
himself asking the Court for punishment, as she had done.  
She imagined how he must think of her.  Spoiled.  Arrogant.  
Disgraceful.  Oh, Mercy, some part of her that enjoyed 
seeing her despair  scolded, I don't deserve his kindness!  
Would not he be pleased if I begged to be taken before the 
Princess for the harshest punishment she could deliver?  
	But then he smiled.  "But at least this way we've met 
so that I like you.  I'm sure if you were in your official 
capacity, I'd find you an intolerable brat, and you'd ignore 
me as beneath your station."
	She blushed miserably.   "What is there to like?  That  
I'm getting what I deserve?  That the smallest torments they 
devise for me are unbearable?"
	He laughed,  "There is that.  And I would be lying if 
I denied that your. . . vulnerability touches me, but 
there's also your spirit.  Anyone who made this much an 
enemy of the Princess cannot be all a coward.  And, you're 
honest with yourself.  You admit you've misbehaved."  He 
studied her, for a moment before he continued, "And, if 
you'll forgive me, Mi'Lady, you're quite beautiful."  She 
closed her eyes, blushing.
	"I. .  ."  She swallowed and tried to continue.  She 
still didn't dare look.  "I feared you found me repulsive. . 
."  She broke into tears, and she felt him close to her.
	"Nonsense!"  He was appalled that she might feel that 
way.  "Why?  How might that be possible?"
	"What can you. . . mercy. . . what can you possibly 
think of a Lady who wets herself so when she's punished?" 
 She sobbed with shame, and he kissed her lightly, 
saying, "Only that she needs to be punished more 
frequently."
	His words froze her.  She was looking up, into his 
eyes, and she knew that her face reported her reaction as 
faithfully as her nipples or sex.  Oh, Mercy. . .
	"I'm sure you agree that if you had a man in your 
household. . . one who wouldn't hesitate to correct you most 
severely, when you needed it, you wouldn't be here today." 
How dare her body react that way to such a suggestion!   
It was insulting to her dignity as a Lady, that this soldier 
thought she needed a man to spank her when she was bad!  And  
how dare he torment her with such images?  But naked as she 
was, squirming in his arms, she didn't dare bluster or 
scold, and she could only tell him the truth of what she 
felt.  She looked down, and said, "No such man would 
tolerate me, Sir."
	"Because you can be selfish and thoughtless and 
willful?"  His voice was very gentle, almost teasing, but 
without malice.
	She nodded.
	"I think he would cherish you when you're giving, 
remind you when you're thoughtless, and discipline you so 
that your will works for you and not against you."
His face was very close to hers and all she could 
think of was how beautiful he was and how strong and gentle, 
and authoritative.  He kissed her again, then.
	"What. . . mercy, what was that for?"
	"I wanted to," He said.
	She tried to say something to him.  Something 
complicated and honest.  She wanted to ask him for 
something, but she didn't know the words.  When she opened 
her mouth to speak, he silenced her with a kiss.  "Hush, 
now.   We'll talk later.  The guards are coming."  He lay 
her back, and stood.  Then, with one last, secret look at 
her he went to hold the door for them.
	Jessica realized that her sex ached and burned with a 
tension wound so tight that she felt her gut would implode.  
Shame radiated from her body casting reflections on the 
polished tile.  It means I need to be punished more, she 
thought, and she almost smiled.

	"It's so difficult," The Princess complained 
laughingly.  "I will please myself no matter what, but I 
must consider the tastes of the Court as well.  They need to 
be entertained.  And then there's you."  She sat up in bed, 
a tray laden with freshly cut strawberries and pancakes 
dripping with honey and half melted butter.  Sunlight  
streamed through the window, onto her bed, making it's white 
sheets appear supernaturally brilliant and clean and 
comfortable.  Her hair had been combed recently and her 
fingernails painted and filed.  She had a beautiful smile 
and it was clear she was enjoying herself.  She was talking 
about Jessica's sentence.
	"I can see that you are very. . . how should I put 
this?  Delicate?  I'm afraid that you'll surrender all too 
easily, and that would spoil everything.  I have the added 
burden of making sure that whatever I devise for you is so 
humiliating that you have to fight it.  That's where the 
drama comes from.  The internal struggle between the desire 
to submit and the cost in pride."  She sighed.  "I'm sorry, 
Honey, but you're so sensitive that I'll have to make sure 
that cost is very, very dear."  She smiled and plucked a 
strawberry from the bowl, dipped it in whipped cream and 
delicately ate it, being careful to keep it's red stain from 
her pristine sheets.
	"I'm sure you appreciate the difficulty."
Jessica stood in the center of the room, forbidden to 
move.  She was naked, her legs comfortably apart, and her 
hands atop her head.  The Princess had also ordered her to 
spread her wings, and so they stretched from her shoulders 
up to the ceiling, and out.  They appeared as glittering 
membranes, wet and suffused with the same warm light that 
dripped from her sex and nipples.  For a Nixie, such a 
display was almost unbearably vulgar, as if she had been 
ordered to spread her nether lips and expose everything.  It 
was horrible, and even though she knew that this was a 
private humiliation, performed only before her Princess, it 
was almost too much to bear.  It was as though the Princess 
was determined to rob her nudity of all dignity.  The tear-
stained face, the ripe, sloppy condition of her sex, and 
even the deep blush that never left her weren't enough.  She 
had to be exposed in the most degrading way possible.
	The relief she had experienced when Roland washed her 
had faded over time, and now the all but invisible rash of 
bites that decorated her private body itched worse and 
worse.   It was more than she could do to keep her hips 
still, and they moved constantly, and ever so slightly, in a 
dance dictated by the discomfort.  Would she squirm again, 
and be punished for it?  She was afraid she would.
	But even worse than that, was the need that her ordeal 
had awakened in her.  She had the feeling of frustration 
that one experiences when sex or masturbation (it had been a 
long time since she had had sex) is interrupted before 
climax.  She had never imagined she could need it that 
badly, and it terrified her.  What if it could get worse?  
Would she. . . ask for it?  Beg?  Oh, Mercy!
	The Princess absentmindedly scratched at her arm.  
"The mosquitoes were a wonderful idea.  I shall have to ask 
the magicians if we can arrange for a smoke pot under each 
x-wrack, and a spell to insure that only the supplicant who 
hangs there is tormented.  Wouldn't that make it more 
entertaining?"
	Jessica gasped and the gasp turned into a sob, and she 
trembled.  She didn't lower her hands or fold he wings, but 
she was wracked with misery she couldn't hide.  
	"You'll be pleased to know that I've arranged 
transport for our entire class.  Especially the girls who 
could stand you."  Katherine paused for another fruit.  
"I've always said that being humiliated before your enemies 
is bad, but being humiliated before your friends is worse.   
I can only imagine how sorry you must be."
	This is for School, Jessica thought.  This is 
punishment for not following her.  For rebelling, I'm to 
stand here naked, itching, with my wings spread and my 
excitement creeping down the insides of my thighs, so that 
she can mock and tease me to her heart's content!   She 
wants me frustrated to tears!  
	There was a knock at the door, and Katherine looked 
up.  "Come," she said.
	The teenage handmaid entered.  She glanced at Jessica, 
but didn't stare.  "The Wheels are prepared, Your Highness."
Katherine smiled.  "Excellent."  She looked at 
Jessica, and then at the maid.  "Do you think we should tell 
her what is in store for her?  So that she may worry and 
fret while she marinates upon The Wheels?"
The handmaid nodded.  Now she did study Lady Jessica, 
her pleased smile never fading.  She reveled in the Lady's 
powerless animosity.  "May I say it?"
	"As a reward for your service, Meredith," Katherine 
allowed.
	Meredith the Handmaid approached Jessica, her eyes alight with cruel 
pleasure.  "Well, Mi'Lady, The Wheels are two brass wagon wheels more 
than ten feet high, and they're. . . I'd say, two feet apart.  You hang 
on them, your left hand and ankle on the left wheel and the same on the 
right."  She paused so that Jessica could imagine this.  "Then they turn 
slowly and round you go.  Now, between the wheels there's all manner of 
things placed so that they stroke you right up the middle. Some are 
feathers.  Some are lashes.  They've stinging nettles, and all manner of 
wonderful surprises.  And you never see what's coming because you're 
arched so.  They go just fast enough that the feathers tickle and the 
lashes hurt."
	The Princess nodded. "It's so.  You see, Dear, there's enough pleasure 
to make you spend at only once around the wheel, but just exactly enough 
pain that you wont.  And I'm afraid that for you, that's a rather large 
amount of punishment.  In one revolution, your sex will be raw and sore 
and so sensitive that  even the caress of feathers will be torment.  It 
would be punishment enough, but I'm afraid you'll turn on the wheel all 
day."
	Jessica sank to her knees, shaking her head, clasping 
her hands in front of her.  But the Princess had more to 
say.  "You see, you need to be ready for your sentence.  You 
need to be on the edge of spending all day so that when 
you're brought before the Court, your humiliation will be 
complete.  I've decided that you'll serve on your hands and 
knees for a year, like Andrea, but before you're allowed 
that, you'll entertain us by having you most interesting, 
private fantasies-the ones that you masturbate to, Dear-
magically extracted for everyone at Court to see.  We need 
the Wheels to get your imagination working."
	Roland, Jessica thought dumbly.  No. . .  no, that 
couldn't be allowed!  Oh, Mercy, what would he think?  He'd. 
. . she'd. . . she tried to imagine what would happen if he 
saw her serving him on her hands and knees. . . if he knew 
that, during the awful night of punishment, her only 
distraction had been the fantasy of him standing above her, 
scolding her in a calm, even comforting voice and telling 
her silly things, like that he cared for her, and found her 
pretty, while he flogged her sex!  He'd never understand!  
He'd find her laughable!  Pathetic!
	"No!  Oh, Mercy, Please!"
	The Princess smiled.  "Do you want to beg me?"
Jessica, her eyes huge, her lips trembling, her hands 
fluttering nodded.  Katherine smiled.  She slid off the bed 
and raised her nightgown.  Her sex was shaven smooth, wet 
and swollen with anticipation, and beautifully lit. "You may 
appeal to your Princess, Jessie."  She took her hairbrush 
from the night table and gave it to Meredith.  "Please 
inspire the Lady," She asked sweetly.  "If she fails to 
finish me before she succumbs to your strokes, she shan't be 
spared."
	Jessica crawled, weeping desperately.  She placed 
herself on her hands and knees and even arched her back and 
rolled her hips to make a pretty and easy target of her 
buttocks for Meredith to torment.  Then she lifted her face 
and asked, "May I please you, Ma'am?"
	"Is it. . . oh, Jessie, it's terribly, horribly 
humiliating, isn't it?"
	"Mercy, yes," Jessica sobbed, tears streaming down her 
face.  The Princess's sex glowed brightly and seemed to 
swell with approval.
	"Then you may, Jessie," The Princess said, softly.  
"You may. . ."
	Meredith waited until Jessica's lips touched the split 
curve of the Princess's organ.  Then she set about to 
punishing the disgraced Lady.  She swung slightly up, and 
snapped her wrist at the last moment each time so that the 
spanking would impart sharp, scalding pain to the 
defenseless orbs.  
	Oh, Mercy, No!  No!  Not there!  Please!  Oh, I 
mustn't move, or quit, or, oh!  It wasn't fair!  Jessica 
tried to concentrate on her service to the Princess.  She 
had been with girls at school, but she had never used her 
lips.  Only her hands, and only rarely. Still, she knew what 
she was supposed to do, and no matter how degrading, she 
resolved to do it if it would spare her from being exposed 
before Roland.  She would do anything, she decided!
	If she could.  The handmaid knew how to spank, and was quick to realize 
that her subject was delightfully tender.  SLAP!  SLAP!   SLAP!  The 
burn became unbearable!   Jessica sobbed, muffling her cries by pressing 
her face against the Princess's sex, ready to surrender when the next 
spank fell, but it didn't.  
	In the moment of respite, Jessica willed herself to lick in 
earnest.  She didn't know what had spared her, but she knew it might not 
last long.
	It didn't.  The moment she composed herself, the Handmaid spanked her 
again, slowly, so that it took every bit of her to remain still and 
submissive, and all she could do was sob pitifully into her Princess.  
But just before she surrendered, the spanking stopped again.
	Jessica moaned and tried again, her tears mixing with the Princess's 
excitement on her cheeks.  She felt Meredith pet her rear with the flat 
of the brush.
	"Are you going to toy with her all day," Katherine asked.
	"If I may, Your Highness," The handmaid said contritely.
	"You may," Katherine smiled.  "But remember that every minute spent 
humiliating her here is a minute she is spared having her sex and anus 
flayed to the edge of orgasm on the Wheels."
	The spanking began again, and it was horrible.  Jessica screamed into 
the quivering flesh.  Her buttocks danced as she  tried to be brave!  
The thought of loosing Roland was enough to make her keep position, even 
when the handmaid lay her chastisement on the same flesh again and 
again.  It was not enough.  She could not bare the spanking, and the 
Handmaid knew it.  The Princess had her hands on her 
hips, paying more attention to the Jessica's beautifully suffering 
buttocks than the Lady's attentions to her sex.Jessica's hands flew back 
to cover herself, and the game was over.
	Oh mercy. . . MERCY!  It. .  please. . .  "Please," 
She gasped.  "Let me again!  Oh, Mercy, I beg you!"
	The Princess stroked her sticky, glistening face, and knelt, looking 
into her eyes.  "You tried very hard, Honey.  I'm proud of you.  But I'm 
afraid you needed to do better.  Don't worry.  You'll have a year to 
learn to take your spankings."  She smiled and clapped.  Two guards 
stepped into the room.
	"Take her to the Wheels, and make sure the feast is prepared for 
tonight.  There will be a great many guests."
	Meredith grinned, pleased with the work she had done, but the 
Princess's look was soft, and almost wistful as she watched Jessica be 
taken away.

	         The Princess�s Court 
                     Part 4 of 5                                               

(FM/Ff nc)

	The Wheels were in the dungeon, which Jessica found to be a terrifying 
place.  It was full of vast arches and confusing tunnels, and everywhere 
she turned, there were dramas of punishment and suffering.  In one room, 
delicate Nixie women wiggled with unending discomfort.  They were 
shackled to the wall, and their wings  stretched and pinned, so they 
appeared as butterflies on display.  In another chamber a desperate 
young man tied over a bench struggled to spare his penis and scrotum the 
wax drippings from a candle wielded playfully by a female warden.  She 
heard his pleading echo through the halls.  They moved her quickly and 
she was sobbing desperately so that she could only glance at the wonders 
that she passed.   There were suits of armor with strategic plates 
removed that held bodies desperate for motion in position, their 
tenderest flesh exposed to the ravishes of whips and straps.  There were 
rows of spanking machines with oiled leather saddles and heavy straps.   
Serving girls hung from their wrists in alcoves, the glow of their 
exposed flesh used to light the long, dark corridors.  From one chamber 
that she dared not look into, there was hysterical laughter and 
breathless cries for mercy.
	The Wheels were at the end, and they were just what Meredith had 
described.  They were massive things, gleaming in the light of torches 
the light that she gave off.  She could see the soft bedl of feathers 
and flower pedals, broken by leather-thonged whips and thin, flexible 
canes.  She broke into tears just looking at them, but the guards had 
their orders and there was no mercy for her.
	First her wrists, and then her ankles were strapped in.  The feathers 
ticked her back and buttocks.  She was bent so that she looked up at the 
ceiling. Her sex, already miserable with need felt swollen and achy, and 
she suffered cramps of frustrated excitement.  She begged the guards 
shamelessly, but they ignored her and when she was helpless they stepped 
away.  One went to the wall, and drew a lever.
	The Wheels began to turn.
	Oh. . . something soft whispered up between her legs.  It touched the 
lips of her sex, caressed her opening, and as she rolled past it, it 
stroked her anus.  Oh, Mercy!  It was felt wonderful and she was 
terrified.  Another caress. . . like the petals of flowers. . .  the 
stone arches of the dungeon rolled past her.  She was facing the floor.  
Moving faster, now.
	Mercyyyyy!  Oh, that felt good!  But there wasn�t enough, and it didn�t 
touch her clitoris!  Oh, the frustration!
	Jessica moaned.  Her flesh was hyper sensitive.  The contact was barely 
enough to feel, and she focused on it with all her might. Maybe, if she 
could just concentrate, she could spend!  Oh, Mercy, please!  Her nether 
lips quivered and dripped and were wiped dry by the kiss of silk.  Her 
clitoris was already ice-hard and she felt that if it were not touched 
she would die.  She felt an aching emptiness and she imagined what it 
might feel like to have it filled with Roland�s cock.
	Swish. . .
	More! Mercy more. . . please. . .
	Swish. . .
	She moaned.  She imagined how she might caress herself if her hands 
were free.  She would open her lips, wider than they were, and 
ever-so-lightly, touch her clit. . . and her fingers would slip inside 
her. . . and it would be divine. . .
	Swish. . .
	She imagined that she was on display, on the wrack in Court.  Oh, the 
humiliation!  They would mock and tease her, and to really devastate 
her, they would make her beg . . .  She�d beg to spend!  Oh, that would 
be perfect!  She�d be so punished. . .
	Swish. . .
	Oh, that tickled!  It barely touched her sex, but it felt like a 
feather duster had been run through her anus.   The welts that covered 
her there, came alive, itching horribly, but also sensing.  Feeling.  
The world whirled past and she whimpered.  The gentle touching was 
building up slowly.  So slowly that she wanted to cry with frustration, 
but it was getting there.  She felt release building in her stomach.  
	Swish. . .Swish. . .Swish. . .
	Her swollen sex drank in the attentions of the machine and she let out 
whimpering moan.  Mercy. . . Mercy. . . oh, when it came, it would be 
incredible.  She would explode!  Her hips began to move in anticipation 
of the orgasm.  If the wheel would only go a little faster she would be 
there, but the machine was superhumanly patient.  No living lover could 
be this slow, or this sure!  She strained as much as she could, trying 
to make the next contact come a little quicker.
	Swish, swish, swish. . .
	M-E-R-C-Y!  Her face was a mask of concentration, her eyes closed, her 
teeth locked.   But the next tick only brushed her thighs, leaving her 
sex barren.   Her moan was heartrending.  And  the one after that, she 
barely felt, but it tickled the pink line between her lips.   She gasped 
with frustration.  She could feel the power of the orgasm building,  
like a storm, from far away.  Her abdomen cramped painfully with need.
	Swish, swish, swish.
	Soft, wonderful things, like fairy�s wings and ghost�s lips passed 
between her legs.  Oh, Mercy, how could they do this to her?  It seemed 
like, at any moment, if she would just. . . just brush against.  . .
	SPLAT!
	Jessica howled.  Her thoughts scattered.  The pain was incredible, 
stinging, smarting, agony.  The Wheels had wheels within them, and she 
had passed, on her way down, a many tailed whip coming up.  Oh, mercy, 
no!  Oh, impossible!  She cried out again, this time as much in 
frustration as in pain.  Now, her sex throbbed with misery where the 
whip had kissed it.  She could feel lines of fire against her, and the 
gentle caress of the feathers and flower petals only slowly began to 
soothe her.  She fell into broken sobs when, at last, the ache blended 
with desperate, wire-thin need that tormented her.  
	And the pleasure started building again.  Oh, mercy, she begged.  Oh, 
mercy, let me spend this time.  Mercy, please. . . 
	A hundred turns, had passed.  The room was the same.  The speed of the 
wheel was the same.  Everything was the same, except for her.  On each 
turn, she was stroked and teased and pleasured and punished.  Each turn 
built within her, a tension born of sexual need on one hand and pain on 
the other.  Now, after a hundred strokes to her sex and anus, she was 
horribly sore.  The misery was constant, and the fear of the next lash 
was agonizing.  Would it come now?  Or later?  When?  Every second was 
spent in anticipation of lash.
	And yet the soothing caress felt so good!  If she could only ignore the 
threat of punishment, she might spend and spend and then hang limply, 
for after that release, there would be nothing left of her.  And if she 
didn�t spend, it seemed the need to would simply rip her apart!  Her 
taught, naked body writhed with pleasure promised but only punishment 
delivered.
	Her sex blazing and dripping, her face contorted by misery, frustration 
and need, and her body trembling with it�s own rhythms, Jessica turned 
slowly on the Wheels.
	
	Katherine had stopped, right before she spent.  She wanted to be �on 
razor�s edge� to enjoy the feast.  She also knew that, just as 
punishment deferred is punishment intensified, so it is with pleasure.  
So she forced herself to be still and recover her wits before she 
summonsed Meredith to dress her for the Sentencing and the Feast.  
	"Will the hall be full," She asked the serving girl, as she labored 
with her Princess�s corset.  
	"Oh, yes, Your Highness!   They are arriving even now.  I had heard 
that many of them had not heard of Lady Connor�s current. . . condition, 
Miss, and that they saw her, and her them for the first time in ages, as 
she wiggled on the wrack." 
	Katherine smiled and closed her eyes to let her mind fill with the 
image!  Oh, how humiliating!  "And her. . . glow?" She asked, still 
savoring it.
	"Ever bright.  She�s been kept in suspense all day."
	Oh!  Maybe, she thought, she should have finished herself.  Surely she 
would be ready to enjoy the festivities again, in minutes, if this 
evening kept it�s delightful pace.  Of course Andrea�s misery was just 
an appetizer.  The main course would be Jessica.
	"And what of Lady Jessica, Meredith?  How does she fair?"
	Meredith looked down, and Katherine felt her face flush with alarm.  
"She hasn�t spent, has she?"  The Wheels should never allow that!  But 
clearly something was up.
	The handmaid looked up, quickly, "Oh, Your Highness, no!  But. . ."
	Katherine put her hands on her hips.  "Meredith, please tell me what�s 
going on with Jessica."
	Meredith swallowed.  "I. . . She was to be taken off at  sixty 
revolutions. .  .  She was left on for over four hundred, Miss. . ."  
She looked at the floor.  
	"Four hundred! Why, Meredith, she�ll be delirious!"  She thought of it.  
Four hundred near-but-not-quite-orgasms, four hundred sessions of 
terrifying mechanical discipline.  And after a sleepless night, as well.  
She glared at the maid.  "What is her state?"
	Meredith looked up, hopefully, and Katherine realized that it wasn�t 
that bad.  "She�s aware miss.  She cannot sit or close her legs,  and 
she is horribly swollen and wet, but she knows what she faces enough to 
beg for your pardon. . ."
	Katherine smiled.  "Was this. . . disobedience intentional?"
	Meredith nodded, but smiled.  Like the Princess, she found the idea of 
punishment for disobedience arousing, but she was far too careful and 
tender to actually break a rule the Princess would discipline for.  She 
had come close this time.  Katherine studied her.  "Four hundred turns.  
Can you imagine how she must suffer?"
	"Oh, she�s in agony, Miss!  Her sex smarts unbearably, itches, and begs 
for friction that, if it were received, she couldn�t abide.  She was 
left untied, and couldn�t even stand to masturbate herself!  And she 
tried as we watched!"
	Katherine felt herself impressed.  She had thought sixty was a great 
many, but she had secretly wished to roast Jessie for longer.  The 
Handmaid had realized this and had sought to please her.  Masturbated 
without care for an audience!  Oh, she must need it!  The Princess 
considered what an amusing show that would make!  Her sex throbbed in 
her panties, and she, had a whim.  Something relatively harmless to 
amuse her in the background of her mind while she ran the court.  She 
studied the young Handmaid.  She was a pretty girl, and used her own 
fear of punishment to devise terrible trials for others.  "I am sure you 
knew I would be pleased with the outcome, if not your methods," 
Katherine told her.  The Handmaid grinned shyly, but proud.   "I am, 
Dear.  You have pleased your Princess.  "But since that is what you 
wish, let me describe another way you may please me."
	"Anything, Your Highness," The girl said.
	"Guard?  Escort Meredith down to the Wheels.  I wish to enjoy the 
thought of her swallowing her own medicine."  She smiled gently into the 
Child�s terrified, wide-eyed expression.  "Don�t worry, Dear.  I don�t 
mean for you to suffer extravagantly.  You�ll only turn a few times.  No 
more than ten, and then I�ll be down to release you."  
	"But. . . but, please. . ."  She was shaking her head.  "Miss, please!  
I couldn�t bare it!"
	Katherine stroked her, comforting her.  "You shall.  Oh, I know how 
tender you are, but it shan�t be for long.  And I promise that you�ll be 
able to make it up with Jessie.  I�ll give her to you for a day to play 
with when she�s a servant here.  Okay?  Your Princess will be very 
pleased to  know that you�ve suffered just a bit.  But not too much.  I 
wouldn�t want the girls to feel that you had been punished for properly 
caring for them."
	Meredith swallowed her tears and tried to hide her fear and her anger.  
She tried to be brave as she was lead away.  Katherine sighed.  It would 
teach her a lesson, but it mustn�t go on too long.  Still.  "Guard," She 
added softly, "Instead of setting it for a certain number of turns, let 
it turn until I arrive.  After all, if I am a little late, I don�t what 
her getting bored."  He nodded, and she listened to the teenager start 
to sob angrily when she thought she was out of earshot.  Don�t worry, 
Child, she thought.  I�ll be down right after the feast.
	It was, she thought, going to be a wonderful party.

	Jessica suffered  a very special kind of agony.  Raw pain, of course, 
but mixed with so many other sensations that she could hardly identify 
it.  The pounding, throbbing need was the worst of it.  She tried to 
clear her mind of the things it brought to her but that was impossible.  
So she merely suffered extravagantly.  At least it was over, she told 
herself.  The time on the Wheels.  But what came next would be her 
undoing.
	She replayed the morning with Roland as she had so many times today.  
He had kissed her, and told her he liked her.  And he had told her. . . 
he had told her that a man who understood her would cherish her.  It was 
almost agony to consider what he would think of her when he saw her 
private fantasies.  Despair wracked her and she cried because of it as 
well as everything else.  She was still sobbing when he came to collect 
her.  She looked up at him and she could see in the concern of his face 
how pathetic she was.
	"Oh, Jessica. . ."  He was speechless.  He knelt.  "Open your legs.  
Let me see. . .  Mercy. . ."  He was shaking his head, looking at the 
thoroughly attended region between her legs.  He looked into her eyes.  
"You. . . you turned on the wheel all day?"  Disbelief.  She nodded, and 
he held her head tightly, rocking her back and forth.  "Oh, baby," He 
murmured to her.  "Mercy, Jessie. . . poor baby. . ."  When she moaned 
he looked down.  "What now?"
	"Please. . .  Oh, Sir, I beg you. . . you mustn�t attend the 
Sentencing.  Please!  If you have any mercy at all!"
	"I. . .   Jessica, you know I have no choice."  He studied her, not 
understanding.  "Why. . . why do you not want me there?" Had she hurt 
him by telling him to go?  Oh, this was horrible.    But she couldn�t 
tell him.   She would explain as best she could.
	"They�re. . . they�re going to humiliate me horribly!  I. . . I 
couldn�t bare for you to see that. . ."  She looked up, into his eyes, 
trying to make him understand the magnitude of her fear.
	He nodded.  "Of course they are going to humiliate you.  And that�s why 
I�m forced to be there.  Humiliation is being naked.  Being exposed, 
without any of the protection society gives you.  It�s to make you 
ridiculous.  It�s as important in punishment as the pain.  More so.  And 
they know I. . . that I care about you.  And they know. . ." He sighed.  
"It is not an option."
	"Roland!"  He stood, to motion the guards to bring in their package.  
She grabbed his sleeve, crying, "Please!  You don�t understand!"  But 
then she was struck speechless, because it was the X-wrack an a wheeled 
cart.  The dowel had been greased so that it gleamed sinisterly in the 
fire-light of the small chamber. She cried out, but he ignored her.
	First her arms were secured.  Then, with one guard holding each leg, he 
guided her hips back toward the wooden rod.  She struggled because she 
couldn�t not struggle.  He shook his head, and then held his palm above 
her sex, while the guards, supporting her weight, held her immobile.  
	"Do you want me to spank your sex?" He asked mildly.
	"Roland!  N-no. . . oh, mercy, no!"
	There was a devastatingly wet smack as he slapped the swollen organ.  
Jessica screamed and kicked and writhed.  It was horrible!  And 
terrifying.  She looked into his eyes, shaking her head.  No. . .no. . . 
she said nothing.
	He nodded.  "Then will you submit?"
	She nodded again.
	His hand remained, threatening a threat she couldn�t bear.  Unable to 
look at it, she turned away.  Wrong.
	SPLAT!
	She howled at the top of her lungs, and her body spasmed.  He had her 
full attention.  "Say it," He ordered.  "No more nonsense from you.  
Yes, I do care for you.  Yes, I do feel. . . that some things are amiss.  
But I also believe that you deserve to be very thoroughly punished, and 
I will gladly carry out that order.  Now tell me you will submit to me."
	"I su-hu-hub-mit, Sir," She blubbered out.  "Please. . . mercy, 
please,"
	 "You�ll have to trust me, Jessica."
	She nodded.
	He rolled her hips and she gasped.  Then she moaned.  There was 
pressure against her raw, smarting anus, and she couldn�t bear it.  Then 
the pressure got worse and she felt her sphincter began to surrender.  
No!  Her body rebelled as best it could, but she felt herself opening.  
Oh, it was huge!  It felt so. . . authoritative back there.  She 
stretched and widened to allow it passage.  She felt it enter the warm, 
tight confines of her body.  It was. . . oh, mercy, it was inside her, 
and she could feel every inch of it!  He slowly lowered her onto the 
greased pole. 
	Then it was in.  Many of the punishments they so enjoyed administering 
generated an embarrassing  physical need of great intensity that the 
subject was not able to satisfy.   Thus the hunger of her sex demanded 
that she masturbate to relieve it.  The itch that still bedeviled her 
nipples would encourage her to rub herself, there, improperly, had she 
been able.  The rod generated, within her, the sensation of being full 
and needing with impossible urgency and desperation to empty herself.  
She squirmed as much as she could, but there was no escaping it.  
	Roland nodded.  "Take her before the Court," He commanded, and they 
began their journey.
	
	"Silence, please," Cried the announcer.  "The Court invites you to look 
to the main doors as Lady Jessica McLangly is presented for sentencing."  
They stood, and looked with great interest.  They had no idea what to 
expect, so her state of utter disgrace would be a surprise.  She heard 
the squeak of the wheels of her cart as she was rolled through the door.  
Oh, Mercy!
	She had thought she would cry, but this was a humiliation beyond tears.  
In the moment that the dozens and dozens of Lords and Ladies looked upon 
her, she realized that she would always be remembered this way.  And 
that they could enjoy her misery guiltlessly because she deserved it and 
because she glowed.  
	She hung her head and whimpered.  Her hips moved because they could not 
be still.  If the smarting sting in her raw sex didn�t compel her, the 
rod that spread her buttocks so much would have.  But those discomforts 
were even unnecessary.  She needed to spend so bad she couldn�t wait to 
be allowed to ask for it.  Maybe, she thought with great shame, if I 
mortify myself, I�ll be �rewarded� the way Andrea was.  At least it 
would be something. . .
	Katherine stood, and looked down from the dais at her.  "Welcome to the 
Court, Jessica.  Oh my!  Oh, my!  We have been naughty, haven�t we?"  
Laughter. The Princess�s simpering tone was perfect mockery and the 
Court appreciated it.    "Clearly you are very. . . ready. . . for your 
sentence."  She spoke to the gathered crowd.  "This young lady�s passion 
has gotten her here.  I felt it would educational for the Court to see 
exactly what sort of imaginings could lead a girl so astray.  With the 
help of a spell prepared by the Court Magician, her thoughts will be 
made public.  If she can. . . resist. . . thinking of such things, she 
may disappoint us, but I believe that will not be the case.  Do you have 
anything to say, Jessica?" 
	She looked up.  She had to try!  Maybe, just maybe if she were utterly 
sincere and held nothing back!  She cried desperately, her face raised 
to Katherine and begged, "Please, Princess!  I beg you and the Court 
don�t reveal  me so!  I beg some other humiliation!"
 Katherine just smiled and Jessica, lifted a narrow wand, with a flick 
of her wrist, set Jessica�s mind free.  She held it as long as she 
could, and though the magic was strong, her desperate fear of loosing 
Roland was stronger.  For a moment, nothing happened.  She looked at 
him, terror streaming down her cheeks, and he shook his head.  "Tell 
them, Jessica," He whispered.
	Oh, Mercy, she thought.
	And she did.
	They were the most arousing things she could think of.  Being walked on 
a leash.  Being punished in public.  Made to serve and obey.  Being 
displayed naked in public, and performing all manner of sex in private.  
She imagined being used mercilessly, his cock, which she imagined to be 
huge, sliding in and out of her, without regard for her pleasure.  She 
imagined humiliating scenes in which she was treated as a bad little 
girl.  Being forbidden or compelled to masturbate.  She imagined all 
this, but, almost worse, were her teddy-bear-sweet, story-book-romantic 
endings, in which he forgave and loved her.  Respected her, even, 
although it seemed ludicrous.  Held her and pressed his lips against 
her, soothing her tears.    She was a tough, proud girl, and her secrets 
mortified her.  The crowd sat in awe.
	
	In the silence that followed, she heard a voice.  It was his.  
Roland�s.  It was loud and clear.  "May I address the Court?"
	There were some whispers.  A few.  Mainly exclamations of respect for 
his bravery and willing to draw their attention to him and away from the 
supplicant at a time like this.  If his reasons were not. . . 
impeccable?  And maybe even if they were, he would still risk the 
Princess�s sever displeasure.  
	"Of course you may, Roland.  I presume you wish to. . . comment?  
Comment on Lady McLangly�s rather interesting ponderances of you."  She 
smiled sweetly, and the Court nodded and babbled softly in agreement.  
That was it!  He meant to make some joke or declaration at the poor 
Lady�s expense and heighten her misery!  In the moment between her 
assent and his reply, they all agreed that it was a very shrewd move, 
and would like advance him within his rank.
	With a misery like the weight of oceans, Jessica felt herself sink.  
Her face burned with the shame of what she had showed them, and she 
waited, her breath held, for him to lower the axe.
	"I wish to speak of my observations of Lady Jessica McLangly," He said.
	"Proceed, Lance Corporal."  She studied him impatiently.  Yes, since he 
had featured rather prominently in her fantasies, he was entitled to his 
moment of fame.  But drawing it out was unwise.  Especially since she 
had some wonderful, witty and amusing things to tease poor, sobbing, 
humiliated Jessica with.  Hurry! she willed him.
	"I believe the Court will agree that, whatever her other faults. . . 
and they may be. . ."  He glanced at her and sighed.  "many. . .  
clearly dishonesty is not one of them."  He waited.
	She looked at his eyes, trying to guess where he might be going with 
this, but his eyes were blank.  Soldier�s eyes, she thought.  Dismiss 
him, then.  Tell him that he may make speeches on his own time.  But 
that blank stare of his was, in some subtle way a challenge, and to 
dismiss him would be to back down from it.  While she considered, the 
men and women in the Galleries, speaking amongst themselves in soft 
whispers had agreed that she was an honest girl.  She had pled guilty, 
hadn�t she?  And had admitted everything now, before everyone!
	"She has been honest, Lance Corporal."  She looked at him.  "If you�ve 
something to say, then say it.  And in any event, I wish to see you when 
Court is adjourned."
	That should have buckled his knees.  It didn�t phase him.
	"Only this, Your Highness.  When I collected her, she fled at first, 
but then came with me.  We discussed her crimes and she told me that she 
was guilty and deserved the fine punishment that she has received."  He 
stopped, and walked forward, his footsteps echoing in the great chamber.  
He came to stand before the Princess and the Prince.  "She mentioned 
then, that she had not sinned alone.  That many of the girls in her 
class were guilty of such things."  He looked up, his eyes meeting the 
Princess�s.  "I realize, Your Highness, that these Courts and 
punishments are not for crimes committed long ago, but only for those 
who have continued, in their adulthood, to indulge in forbidden 
pleasures.   I have given some thought as to how she might have been 
caught.  Her and Lady Connor.  And, I confess that I have very few 
ideas.  But it is clear that they both have a passionate imagination and 
a taste for extreme sensations."  He stood a moment.  "I feel that it is 
my duty, as a sworn defender of the Great Contract to express these 
observations and to ask, Your Highness, were there any other girls who 
shared these traits and were known to dream meddle?"
	Princess Katherine opened her lips to speak and then closed them.  
"What are you implying, Soldier?" She said.  She said it coldly.
	"That there may be some who deserve to be punished, who have, so far, 
escaped justice."  He did not look away.
	She laughed.  "Commendable, Lance Corporal.  If it were your duty to 
investigate these things, you would be a tribute to your uniform.  As it 
stands, I can only assure you that these matters are."  She leaned 
forward, giving him one last chance, "well in hand.  Now, you have 
interrupted us enough, and stolen some of Lady McLangly�s well earned 
fame, so please await my audience in a side chamber."
	He didn�t move.  He studied her, and then he nodded.  "Your Highness, I 
feel that there is enough evidence in Lady McLangly�s statements and 
your demeanor to implicate. . . you."
	Nobody breathed and nobody moved.  Jessica looked at him, standing 
alone, and she wanted to beg that he cease.  That he not condemn himself 
any further, but it was obviously already too late.
	"Get this sniveling, heretical peon out of my sight," The Princess 
said.  She said it to the guards.  Her voice was normal.  Outraged, but 
hardly afraid.  When the guards moved, his hand went, ever so subtly to 
his sword and they stopped. 
	"I will surrender myself to your will, Your Highness, as soon as you 
have addressed my concern."
	She glared at him.  "I will do no such thing.  And you will be 
tormented day and night in the public square for this.  You�ll. . ."
	"Did  you ever dream meddle?" He asked, interrupting her.
	She opened her mouth.  And then closed it.  There were, of course, many 
people here who knew.  She could not simply deny it.  The Prince looked 
at her and she felt color and a faint heat in her cheeks.  "I. . .  In 
school. . ."  She laughed, but it was a funny, almost pitched laugh that 
sounded the slightest bit hysterical in the quiet of the Court.  "It was 
years ago."  She stared at her husband.  "Richard, everyone did it.  
This is. . . This is not the place."  She mustered her dignity and 
brandished her authority and turned back.  "Guards, I have spoken.  
Remove this man immediately.  He has insulted his Princess, and he will 
pay."
	"Have you dream meddled since school, Your Highness?" 
	She looked at him, thinking that she must not let anyone see the fear 
that threatened to explode from her chest.  She must not, for a moment 
let them think that she was anything less than utterly unconcerned.  She 
gripped the arms of her throne to keep her hands from trembling.  Oh, 
mercy, why didn�t he flee?  How could he stand to challenge her?  She 
was. . . she was terrible.
	Because, she saw, when she looked into his eyes, he was sure.
	And his certainty allowed anything.  She felt her lips tremble.  
"Never," She said.  "Never since."  She swallowed, thinking 
hysterically, that she must speak louder if they were to believe her.  
"I. . ."
	"Would you say so under Compelled Oath, Your Highness?" he asked 
blandly.
	"No!"  She looked around.  "I. . ."  She turned to the Prince.  "Why do 
you allow this?  Richard, this. . . this man. . . and the guards. . . 
and all the servants who have not removed him must be. . ."
	He studied her intensely and seconds passed in which he neither moved 
nor spoke.  Then it was clear from his manner that he reached some 
conclusion.  But he said nothing.
	There was a single, soft footfall as Roland approached the dais.  She 
shrank back into the plush chair, he eyes wide as she looked into his.  
Oh, Mercy. . . mercy, no. . . please. . . she shook her head and her 
lips whispered, ". . . anything you desire!  Please. . . oh, mercy. . ."
	"Sire,"  Roland said, "I am no magician, but I believe I can compel the 
truth from your wife by more traditional means.  If I may?"
	The Prince glanced mildly around the crowded room.  He shrugged.  "You 
are a Soldier.  Do your duty,"
	Katherine moaned.
	The Lance Corporal smiled.

		  The Princess�s Court 
                      Part 5 of 5


(FM/FF nc)


	This couldn�t be happening!  Princess Katherine looked wildly around 
from the faces of her guards to the faces of the aristocrats in the 
Galleries.  They, by the looks of shock she saw, couldn�t believe it was 
happening either.   Lance Corporal Roland took her by the wrist and 
pulled her from her throne.  Then  he brought her around, and she found 
herself face to face with her reflection on the polished floor.
	She was over his knee.
	She was a Princess, arrayed in her finest dress, before the whole 
Court. . . the Court she would have to face every day for the rest of 
her life, and she was over his knee! And she had been very bad.  No, she 
told herself.  I must fight!  I. . . I can�t confess. . . not after what 
I�ve done!   She struggled, and he captured her hand.  In one motion her 
dress was raised, exposing the white curve of her panties.
	"It has clearly been a long time since you�ve had a spanking, Your 
Highness.   I think I�ll allow you your panties."  She felt his fingers 
caress the thin silk strip that covered her bulging sex.  He stroked the 
dark furrow between her nether lips, and she flushed knowing that he 
found her hot and wet.
	POW!
	Ugh!  Mercy!  That stung. . . it hurt!  
	POW!
	"This will stop," he said calmly, "When you confess and give proof.  
It�s up to you how long it lasts."
	He began to spank with a rhythm.  She was as unused to punishment as 
any of the Ladies, but unlike some, she had witnessed dozens and she 
knew how ridiculous it looked to squirm over your punisher�s lap.   She 
felt horrible shocks of humiliation rip through her, and it was even 
worse than the pain.  He stripped her of self control and dignity, one 
spank at a time, knowing that the time of tears and confessions would 
inevitably come.   And so he was in no hurry.
	Oh Mercy!  Oh, that hurt!  She mustn�t make a noise!  Can�t cry!  Oh, 
all the people!  The sounds echoed sharply in the hall and sounded like 
fire works!  When she did squeal, she realized how quiet the room was, 
except for her and him.
	POW!  POW!  POW!
	The situation under her panties was getting unbearable.  She tried to 
remind herself of what would happen if she confessed, but it didn�t seem 
to matter.  Her struggles were becoming more frantic now, and little by 
little, noises were escaping from her.  This was horrible!  She looked 
back, trying to determine if his intention, and he smiled back at her, 
not at all impatient.
	"Owww!"  She shrieked, and struggled without any care for how she 
looked.  The spanking had to stop now!  She couldn�t bear another second 
of it!  "Stop!  I order you!  Oh!  OH!   Please!"
	He chuckled.  "I think you know how to stop this."
	Over his knee she was helpless.  He had her buttocks at a perfect 
height and position.  He punished them carefully, and methodically.   He 
was, she realized, with something like terror, doing what she had done 
so many times.  He was taking her through the stages of a spanking, 
letting her suffer each one along the way before moving forward.  She 
had been in the reversed position many times, and had enjoyed the 
hopeless resistance the supplicant presented.  Through her mind flashed 
all of the pridefull girls she had broken over her lap, and she began to 
weep.
	"Please!  Not in public!  Please!"
	"Yes, Princess.  In public, before everyone.  And with full knowledge 
that when you do, it will be even worse.  If you need comfort, take it 
in the fact that you will get what you deserve."
	He went faster now, the preliminaries over, and her body responded 
beautifully.   He had brought her to an intimate place, where he 
controlled all pleasure and pain, and gave her what she knew she 
deserved.  The terrifying intimacy of her situation broke her and she 
sobbed out her confession.
	"My Diary," She cried.  "It�s all there.  Oh, mercy, Sir!  Please!"
	No body moved.  The Prince spoke.  "This is true the, Katherine?"
	She nodded, crying so hard that she was almost breathless and shook 
with her sobs.  She pressed her face into her hands, unable to bear the 
sight of those around her.  
	The Prince nodded.  "Then there shall be justice."  He nodded to 
Roland.  "Disrobe her.  It is unfitting that she should enjoy the 
dignity of clothing.  She may retain her corset and the boots, for the 
Court will find it amusing that she not be utterly naked.  But 
everything else must go."
	"As you wish, Sire," Roland said.  He stood her before him and without 
any preamble began to remove her clothes.  She enjoyed being undressed 
sensuously, and often instructed her handmaids to assist her in such a 
manner.  Then, she would admire her body, and if there were others 
around, she would know that they found her beautiful, and she would 
revel in their awe.
	The Soldier just stripped her and it was horrible.  There was no awe.  
They enjoyed her beauty, but  her terror and tears inspired more 
amusement and pity than reverence.  She stood in her corset, her silken 
panties and her boots of white leather, and trembled.  Her fine dress 
lay on the side.  Her face, carefully made up, was now streaked with 
tears.  She squirmed in place as he prepared to remove the last of her 
dignity.
	"Sir, no. . .   you can�t. . ."  She struggled for words that would 
make him understand.  He had to understand!  "I am a Princess, Sir. . . 
I cannot be shamed so. . ."
	He nodded.  "Because as a Princess, you will feel it so much more 
deeply?  Because if you are disgraced, you will be revealed to be 
unworthy of your authority?  And because once they have acquired a taste 
for your humiliation and  submission, it will be expected?"
	Oh, mercy!  He understood.  She nodded, sobbing.  Oh. . .  Oh, he would 
spare her. . . march her away, and she would suffer in private.
	Roland shook his head.  "You should feel it deeply, you are unworthy of 
your authority, and I suspect it will be a long time before the Court 
tires of you."  He slit her panties at the waist with a pocket knife, 
and drew them away.  She felt them slide away, and she was exposed.  The 
Princess shrieked and folded to her knees, her hands trying to hide the 
light that poured out of her.  She heard the room reverberate with 
laughter and applause.
	The Prince held up a hand.   During the silence, he studied the scene 
before him.  His wife shook and sobbed.  The soldier awaited 
instruction.  "You did not know.  You only suspected.  You are lucky you 
were right," He said.
	Roland nodded once.
	"Since you were right, and because of the risk you took, I wish to 
reward you.  Name it."
	He didn�t hesitate.  "Lady McLangly has a year of service to fulfill."  
He looked back at her, and she looked up at him from the wrack she hung 
on.  On the floor, at his feet, Katherine realized what was happening, 
and how her plans had failed.  Even backfired.   She moaned, deeply.
	"I have need for an assistant and if you will grant me a boon, I would 
like the service of Lady Jessica McLangly."
	Jessica stared at him, trembling.  She didn�t know what to feel, or 
what to think.  She felt the eyes of the assembly upon her but for the 
first time she didn�t care.
	The Prince laughed.  "If I had figured so prominently in her. . . 
desires, I might wish her as an assistant also.  But there are some 
matters that remain to be clarified.  Her year is to be one of hardship.  
Would you be strict with her?"
	"I promise, Sire, that she shall, at times, wish she were under 
Katherine�s hand.  She shall be held to the highest expectations, and 
corrected in a most thorough and meticulous manner when she does not 
meet them."
	The Prince nodded.  "And more importantly, will you care for her?  You 
may treat her as a toy at times, but you must never forget that she is 
not one."
	He looked back again, appearing to assess her.  He turned back to the 
dais.   "Sire, I cannot help but care for her.  It is not an issue."
	The Court broke into scattered, excited conversation.  Whispered 
suppositions.   From sounds and tones and half heard words she realized 
that they approved.  She looked up, and found the Prince�s gaze upon 
her.
	"What do you think of this?" He asked,  "Not that you have a say, but I 
wish to know.  You have been rather. . . revealed to him.  Does not the 
idea of his knowing your secret dreams intimidate you?"
	"Terribly, Sire," She managed.
	"And how do you feel about being punished by him?"
	"He is. . ."  She looked down, blushing again, "merciless with me.  I 
cannot bear it."
	"Then do you wish to spend your year serving him, knowing that you 
shall be spared nothing?"
	She looked up and bit her lower lip and nodded.  More than anything, 
she thought.
	"Then it is granted."  He turned to Roland.  "She is yours.  See to it 
that you are worthy of the honor."
	Roland stepped past the Princess and as the Court watched in silence, 
he crossed the floor to where she hung.   He took her gently, and held 
her while he brought his lips to hers.  He kissed her then, and she 
heard the roar of the crowd thunder in her ears.
	Prince Richard nodded the Court.  "Let the festivities begin."

	Jessica, still mounted upon her wrack, had been moved to the dais, 
where Roland stood by the Prince while they watched the Court floor fill 
with feasters and dancers.  Tables had been brought in, and there were 
roast pigs basted in pineapple juice and sweet potatoes and steaming 
pies and great flasks of wine and ale.  The decision of how Princess 
Katherine was to enjoy the occasion had been answered when it appeared 
that one of the serving girls (one of her handmaids, apparently) could 
not be found, and so it had been requested that she take the girl�s 
place.
	The Princess made a horrible servant, Roland thought, but she was 
learning.
	Lady Isabel, a strong, exotic beauty from their past had just corrected 
her on her attitude.  "You must be grateful to serve, Kathy," She said 
with a smile.  "Come here."  The Princess came forward slowly, but 
Isabel, seated on one of the long benches patted her lap.  "Over me, 
Honey.  Right there.  Good.  Now spread your ankles wide.  When I have a 
new serving girl with a bad attitude, I always like to spank down upon 
the buttocks and up upon the sex. It makes things much more personal and 
effective."  
	Several of the other Ladies agreed and positioned themselves to enjoy 
the spectacle.  One asked, "Would you care that she�s already very sore 
and tender ?"
	"Mercy, no!" Isabel laughed.  "I wouldn�t give it a thought.  In 
matters of attitude correction, I think it�s best to punish just as hard 
as she were pristine."  Again, there was much good-natured laughter and 
agreement.  They scolded the Princess playfully, telling her to keep 
herself exposed that the punishment could be applied to the most 
sensitive parts of the flesh, and offering suggestions of awful torments 
she might endure if she dared close her legs.  They had her in tears 
before the spanking even began.
	Isabel had been one of Jessica�s friends, and an outcast as well, in 
school.  Now, the Ladies (many of them from Katherine�s crowd) seemed to 
feel that they had misjudged her and watched with rapt attention to see 
how she would deal with the Princess.
	"Just as I would any naughty servant girl," She explained.  "I would 
give her exactly what she needs."
	The spanking began with one on the left, one on the right, and then an 
upswing to lay a stroke on the tender curve of the Princess�s sex.  The 
sound was wet and loud.  When the Princess screamed for mercy, she was 
gently admonished that she was expected to show her appreciation for 
being so well disciplined.  The sound of her thanks rang out though the 
room.
	When, at last, Isabel was done, she consoled the sobbing girl, holding 
her and telling her she would learn eventually.  She showed the 
Katherine the hand that had been used to chastise her and explained that 
it was rather soiled with the wetness of Kathy�s sex, and that Kathy was 
expected to clean it.  She praised the girl�s humility as Princess 
Katherine licked her clean.
	But then there was a spill in the kitchen, and one of the girls, 
smiling sweetly appeared in the doorway to summons the new serving girl 
to come and clean it.  She held a wooden spoon, and suggested that her 
Princess come fast, or she would use it upon her.  The Princess came as 
fast as she could but it wasn�t enough and they all enjoyed the loud 
scolding with emphasis delivered by the spoon, before Katherine 
disappeared inside.
	This had been going on all night, and would continue until the revelers 
were through.
	The Prince sighed.  "I shall have to arrange for some very imaginative 
trials for her.  After all, she must be seen to suffer worse since her 
station is higher."
	Roland nodded.  "I am sure there are many who would offer suggestions."
	The Prince turned to his side.  Jessica was exhausted.  She had, during 
the party, drifted off to sleep many times, despite her torment.  When 
she was awake, she was always dreamily happy that Roland was at her 
side.  He hadn�t left her, even when he had been asked to come down and 
join in with the dancing and feasting.  He had only left once to bring 
her some wine and a plate of food that he fed to her and she devoured.
	"I presume that she would be one of them."  He made her look at him  
"Lady Jessica, if it were your sentence to name, how would Princess 
Katherine be cared for?
	She glanced at Roland.  "Be extravagant," He told her with a slight 
smile.  "We know you�re capable of it."
	Jessica blushed, and began to consider.

	Morning came and she realized that she was in the Soldier�s Quarters.  
He had a private room and a cot, and a mat for her to sleep on.  She was 
covered with a blanket that was warm, but itchy and uncomfortable.   Oh, 
Mercy!  The events of the night came flooding back to her, and she 
stifled a whimper of passion and confusion.  It seemed impossible, but 
it was true.  She looked up, afraid that some reality might break the 
spell, and saw him sleeping easily upon his cot.
	She drew the blanket closer around her and shivered, not from cold, 
from the intensity of what she had experienced.  When the revelers had 
gone, he had lifted her, cleaned, and carried her here.  She had been 
mercifully exhausted and sore, and it had felt wonderful.  Now concerns 
like hunger and needing to use the chamber pot were allowed to be felt, 
but those could be delayed.  She was his.  She played with the idea and 
found it terrifying and wonderful at the same time.  It was only for a 
year but. . .  but what then?  And what might he do with her?
	Why, anything, of course!  The Princess had seen to that!  He knew what 
she imagined, and so he would not hesitate.  If she needed to be 
punished, he would use her own ideas and needs and fears against her, 
and it would be unbearable!  Awful!  She shuddered and smiled, and 
couldn�t take it anymore.  She let her hand test her flesh.
	Oh!  Owww. . . still raw and sore from her hours on the Wheels. . . but 
if she were careful. . .  oh, the release would be. . .  She looked up.  
He was asleep?  His breathing was regular and soft.  Good.  She explored 
herself again, testing the sensitivity of the wet, pink flesh between 
her lips.  It was still slightly stitched with the bites of the insects, 
and still swollen with kiss of the floggers and canes upon the wheel, 
but it felt magnificent to touch it.  Only the lightest, most 
frustrating contact was allowed, but she felt that with a good half-hour 
she might be able to relieve herself.
	Jessica began to masturbate, letting her mind wander, and letting her 
fingers search out what pleasure they could find.  She closed her eyes 
and she imagined she was in the Court, displayed, humiliated, and he 
stood before her.  He was naked and powerfully hard, and he meant to 
match the dowel in her rear with his cock in her front.  And she was so 
raw and sore, and he was so big!  She imagined that she begged him 
(horrified) not to take her so, for she could not bear it, but he would!  
Oh, he would be harsh and merciless, and she would. . .
	He took her wrist and lifted it away from her and she moaned.  Oh 
mercy. . . Ohhhhhhhh. . .   it was an agonizing, physical pain, and she 
flopped, like a fish, beached, until she could master herself.  Blushing 
furiously, she dared glance up to meet his eye.  He was smiling.
	"Are Ladies allowed to do that?" He asked.
	She shook her head.
	"What about ladies who have been naughty?"
	She shook her head again, looking down.  She whimpered.
	"And what should we do?"
	"Punish me, Sir," She said, her voice very quiet.  Oh, Mercy, this was 
embarrassing!  How was it that, after all she had been through, she 
could still be mortified?  
	Roland pulled her, effortlessly lifting her atop him, and then he 
rolled her over so that he was laying on her, looking down.  She felt 
the weight of his body.  "I think," He told her, "That you have a good 
many bad habits that we will need to break you of.  This is one of them.  
But perhaps the best way to begin is to show you how much better it 
would be if it were done properly."
	She felt pressure against her nether lips, and she moaned, and he slid 
inside her.  She ached and stretched, and cried out, pressing her lips 
against his chest, and bucking up against him.  Had he allowed it, she 
would have spent instantly, but he didn�t.  He moved slowly at first, 
awakening rhythms deep inside her that built like a tide.  Like a tidal 
wave.  She struggled to hasten the process, but he knew what he was 
doing, and there was no hope of that.  Finally, she just let him, and 
she felt herself come apart.  From outside, the servants passing in the 
hall could see flashes, like strobe lights coming from the crack under 
the door, and they heard her moaning.  He must be punishing her 
horribly, they thought, and hurried on.

	The pillory in the courtyard compelled it�s occupant to kneel and it 
included cuffs for the ankles to insure that the flesh between the legs 
would be visible.   It was on a circular platform no more than a few 
inches off the ground, that turned so that the Lords and Ladies and 
servants and soldiers could enjoy the view from their windows.  Often a 
naughty maid, or a misbehaving young private occupied the pillory,  but 
today it was the Princess.
	She heard passing soldiers joke about how she turned like a lighthouse, 
and maids giggled near the walls over discussion on the state of her 
buttocks and thighs.  When she thought of how she had been humiliated 
during the night, she cried, and wished miserably that they had allowed 
her some privacy.  They hadn�t even taken her to the bath chamber!  The 
moment she had awakened, she had been brought here!
	At least someone would bring her food soon.  She was starving.  In all 
the punishments given at the court, from the towers to the dungeons, 
guards would see to it that the subject received food and water, 
otherwise, no relief.  She had often enjoyed assigning long stays in 
such bondage because she knew that it magnified even the smallest 
discomforts to heroic proportions.  Now, with not even an hour passed, 
she was beginning to understand how cruel she�d been.  She wiggled 
uncomfortably and tried to find some measure of peace.  Footsteps.  Oh. 
. . someone.  She looked up and was glad to see two figures carrying 
bowls that would be her breakfast, but then she gasped.
	"Good morning, Kathy," Jessica said.  She nodded, surveying the young 
woman�s body.  Very appropriate, she thought, smiling.  Very severe.  "I 
brought you some oatmeal, but before you�re allowed to eat it, I�m to 
give you four tablespoons of castor oil."  She sat down beside the 
Princess�s head, and lifted some of the girl�s hair out of her face.  
Andrea moved around behind her, out of view.
	"I. . .  please, Jessie, I can�t.. . . I�m to be out here all day," 
Katherine said softly.
	"Then you�ll want your breakfast," Jessica told her.  She began to 
measure a soon of the dark liquid.
	"They. . . please.  They won�t let me out.  Not even to. . ."  She 
sucked in air that became a sob.  "I�m out in public, Jessie!  Everyone 
can see me. . ."  Jessica stroked her cheek, feeling the tension in her.  
Fear of humiliation.  Fear, Jessica thought, of humiliation that would 
come to pass.  "Spare me this, I. . . oh, Jessie, I�m begging you!"
	�Shhh. . ."  Jessica gently parted the Princess�s lips, and fed her the 
spoonful.  She smiled at the Princess�s face.  Just like a child!  "Just 
three more," She coaxed.
	Sobbing, furious at the unfairness of it, but afraid of what they would 
do if she disobeyed, the Princess took her medicine.  Jessica�s 
soothing, mocking comments about what a good girl she was being made it 
infinitely worse!  Oh, she hated the girl!  Oh, this was torture!  It 
tasted terrible, and it made her stomach feel heavy and full, and she 
knew where that would lead. . .
	"Do you want to feed her while I apply the soap?"  Andrea asked.
	"Soap?"  She asked.  What were they talking about?
	"It�s a rather severe, pasty soap," Jessica explained.  "It needs to be 
washed off quickly, or the itch is just horrible.  You can�t imagine.   
Andrea�s going to clean your anus and sex, but we haven�t brought any 
water.  I�m sure someone will come along and rinse you.  And soon I 
hope.  I�m told it�s just maddening. . ."  She shook her head.
	The Princess�s expression was wonderful,  "No!   Please, not. . ."  She 
shook her head.
	Andrea giggled.   "They didn�t even gag her.  Do you suppose she�ll beg 
passing stable boys to come and clean her?  Maybe order them to?"  The 
idea was awful, and even though it was hopeless, Katherine struggled.   
Andrea watched her for a time, and then, to end it, spanked her once.
	The Princess cried out and then whimpered.  She was that tender.  
	"You�re to stay still, Kathy," Andrea said.  "Do you understand?"
	They wanted her to say it.  They wanted her to talk, and she realized 
miserably that she had no choice.  "I understand," She said quietly, and 
as though it were a great effort.
	SLAP!  Katherine cried out, and just as she was finished, Andrea 
spanked her again. "I understand," She said, desperately and with great 
conviction, "I do!  I shall be still! Ow!  OWW!  Please!  PLEASE!"
	Jessica laughed delightedly.  "Why Kathy, she�s hardly even spanking 
you!  Are you that tender?"
	Behind her, Andrea playfully swatted at the defenseless target.  She 
was amazed at how quickly she could render the Princess squealing and 
begging, and wished to explore this state.  She also watched the girl�s 
frustration level rise.  Being held in place and spanked was galling!  
"How are you to address Jessie and I, Katherine?" She asked, making sure 
she kept the girl nearly hysterical to make answering more difficult.
	"Miss. . . I mean, Ma�am!  I understand, Ma�am!  Pleaaseee!"
	"And you�ll be good?"  She was glad to see that Jessica was entertained 
greatly by this.  Let�s see if I can entertain her more, Andrea thought.
	"I�ll be good, Ma�am!  I promise!  I�ll be good!  Please!  Oh, please, 
stop!  I can�t bear it! Oh. . . OH!"
	"Then beg me to soap you.  Be specific and loud,"  She had to raise her 
own voice to be heard over Katherine�s cries, "enough to make everyone 
knows what you need."
	Surely, Jessica thought, this is too much!  Surely she won�t submit to 
that, and she�ll have to be thrashed thoroughly!  She expected some 
resistance, but the Princess�s swollen buttocks were beyond bearing 
anything and she cried out, desperate to please her tormentors.
	"Soap me!  Please soap me terribly!  Oh, my. . . oh, my sex."  SLAP!  
"My Sex!"  She cried so that Jessica blushed, thinking about who was 
watching this and how it must look.  Poor Katherine! "And my anus!  
Please!  Please punish me terribly!  Oh! Oh!"
	"There, there, Princess," Jessica said.  The spanking was over, but 
Katherine was still struggling to compose herself.  They gave her a time 
to think about her situation and bring her trembling body under control.  
Then Jessica began to feed her, spooning oatmeal into her mouth, while 
Andrea smeared some of her most delicate skin.   She felt soaped fingers 
slide in and out of her, leaving her gasping for breath.  She was even 
still when  Andrea, finding her clitoris sensitive, rubbed it harshly, 
so that the discomfort was incredible.
	Finally they were done, and Jessica stood.  "I think you�ll have plenty 
of time to learn to take your spankings, Kathy."  She knelt and kissed 
her tenderly and Katherine watched them leave.  Her hand twitched in the 
pillory lock.  Somewhere, between her thighs, she felt the irritation 
begin.  "Jessie, Andrea!  Please!  Oh, please!  Oh, mercy, don�t leave 
me like this!  Oh, it�s terrible!  Oh.  Oh, I shall perish!"
	Andrea giggled.  "Do you think she realizes it�s not even began yet?" 
She asked Jessica.  Jessica looked back and then up at the clear morning 
sky. 
	"If she doesn�t, she will." She said with a smile.
	
	When she next appeared in Court, some days had passed and some 
preparations had been made. Jessica looked different, too.  She was 
dressed simply, for travel, with an ankle length brown skirt and a 
forest green blouse.  Her hair was tied back.   It was clean and 
straight.  Roland allowed her no makeup and no styling.  He had also had 
her fitted for anklets, bracelets, and a collar of soft leather.  They 
were almost imperceptible, but she felt like they were terribly obvious.  
Not obvious, but more of a problem, was the leather belt she wore under 
her dress.  She had confessed, over his knee, to masturbating often, and 
this would prevent that.  It also meant she had to ask to relieve 
herself in other ways, and that she would receive no privacy at any 
time, but she had not been asked her opinion of the matter.
	She stood behind him, her neck bent, and she endured comments about how 
she looked like his contrite kid sister from the onlookers with a faint 
blush.  It could, she realized, be much, much worse.
	The Princess�s throne was gone.  In it�s place was a great wooden chair 
of ancient manufacture.  It was intricately designed, with gargoyles 
staring down from it�s back, and hand rests carved like swans.  It was, 
in it�s way, more impressive and imposing than even the Prince�s chair, 
but that was okay.  It had a purpose, and it served it�s purpose to draw 
attention to itself.
	Princess Katherine sat in it, her wrists and forearms strapped to its 
arms, he ankles and calves tied along it�s legs, spreading them wide.  
The ties were snug but comfortable:  it had been decided that she would 
still sit in Court, and thus would, on some weeks, sit all day, every 
day.  But her buttocks did not rest on it�s seat, rather they hovered 
above it, her weight supported by straps that held her body in place.
	She was immobile and naked.
	The seat of the Princess�s Throne was carved as a face, in relief on 
the dark wood, and this was magic.  It smiled up at her with wooden eyes 
and wooden lips, and with it�s soft, warm wooden tongue, it licked.  It 
had started licking her the moment she was seated, and it only stopped 
when she was about to spend.  The chair waited then, for its mistress to 
calm down so it might begin again.
	At first, it took some time to bring her to the edge.  It would spend 
its effort between the lips of her sex and the tight, narrow opening of 
her anus.  As one hour became two though, the time that she stayed in 
that heightened, dangerous state, where she might spend with the 
slightest pleasure was longer, and so was the time that she went with no 
stimulation at all.
	She could beg, though.  She was tied and gagged, but she could beg with 
her hips and eyes, and she did.  She saw them come and with a wild, 
hysterical expression, she moaned into the gag and tried to thrust her 
hips forward, inviting them to relieve her.  Jessica saw tears on her 
cheeks, and watched her blush.  She knew exactly how this looked, 
exactly how awful it was, and she did it anyway.  She needed the 
friction.  She needed to be filled.  It would not happen.  Not for a 
year.
	Jessica smiled up at her, and she looked away, unable to bare the 
girl�s pity.
	Roland addressed the Prince.  "I wish to leave, Sire.  I have. . . I 
think I am tired of the Court."
	"Where will you go?"  The Prince asked.
	"To some of the New Lands, or perhaps the Dusk Valley.  No place 
impossibly far or dangerous, but somewhere there�s adventure to be had."  
He shrugged.  "Wherever the road goes."
	"And Jessica will accompany you?"
	"She must.  And I dislike traveling alone."
	The Prince nodded.  "I grant you leave then.  Go out and learn new 
things and tell us all of your adventures when you return."  He looked 
at Jessica.  "Obey him, and learn from him, and take care of him." 
	"Yes, Sire," She nodded.
	They were on the road that wound down from the Palace to the rolling 
foothills.  They both rode his horse, her sitting in front of him, so 
that she rested against his chest and as he held the reigns, he held 
her.  She was thinking ahead to when they might stop for the night, and 
maybe she could convince him (after dinner of course) to allow her a 
bath in one of the warm streams near here.  And then, when they were in 
the water together, she might swim up to him and. . .  She smiled, 
glanced back, and noticed an odd, puzzled expression on his face.  
"Sir?"
	He shook his head.  "Just wondering.  The Throne is a terrible 
punishment, but I had thought you�d have her put on the Wheel. . ."  He 
looked at her.  "You didn�t think of it?"
	"Oh I did," She smiled. "I even went to look at it again."  She sighed, 
with a little laugh.  "It was. . . occupied."
