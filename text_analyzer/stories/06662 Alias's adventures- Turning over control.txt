Chapter 1: My big day

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I suppose this all started over half a decade ago when I publish my very first story online. Hands down my all time favorite story that I&#8217;ve written would have to be my first. I was in my last year of being a teen and by law not old enough to even read the things I was writing about. My heart fluttered from excitement and fear with every word I typed as for the first time in my life I put in the open my darkest, most perverted thoughts. I spent over a month on an erotic high as I crafted my kinky ideas into a readable story.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;No story I have ever written since then has ever matched that same high. As I have aged my stories have matured in quality and concept. The new ideas I come up with still titillate my mind but nothing close to what I&#8217;ve experienced in the past. As time goes on I find myself chasing wilder and wilder ideas in an effort to top my original high. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;These days I&#8217;m twenty-five, graduated from college and living in the Seattle area. I have a full time job that keeps me incredibly busy and leaves little free time. Lately, as the project I&#8217;m working on is wrapping up, I am finally getting some free time to get back to writing and do the things like go to the gym that I didn&#8217;t have the free time to do before. Even with my 6&#8217;1� muscular build the 200lbs I&#8217;ve hit is a bit much. My free time has finally allowed me to get back to a routine that includes the gym. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In addition to finding the time to write and work out I&#8217;ve also begun to start exploring my own sexuality. I have spent so much time writing about other people&#8217;s sexuality that I have never truly tested my own. From the many years I&#8217;ve been posting stories online I have met a lot of people who share the same passion for all things kinky as I do. While most are stretched across the globe there are a number near enough to call local. It was just luck that I took a job in Seattle about the same time as when one of my long time online contacts moved within fifty miles of the area. For the purpose of this story we will call him Chris.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Chris was one of the only people I have ever let see my darkest stories. Over the past few years we have talked about many of my story ideas that I have never posted simply because they were too dark and twisted. It was partially a fluke that this open friendship occurred. 
I had just published my �Bike Ride� story (one of the few stories loosely based around me) and Chris had dropped me an email saying he was an enthusiastic fan who loved the story. He especially enjoyed that part about the notes that were left behind describing the biker and all the things they enjoyed having done. Chris suggested that I expand on the revealing notes idea and write a story where the character filled out an entire sex checklist and left that were people could find it.
Until that point I had never heard of a sex checklist, which in my response was exactly what I emailed back to Chris. It was a Saturday night and I had come back drunk from a house party. This was right after I had posted �Bike Ride�, one of my first stories, so the high I was experiencing from just finishing and posting a story was lingering. I hadn&#8217;t been laid at the party so typical of me when I got home I decided to keep drinking and use my high speed connection to surf the net for porn. My first stop online was to my email account to see if anyone else had messaged me about my new story. There was only one new message and it was Chris&#8217;s reply. I opened it and followed the hyperlinks to the sites he had suggested. 
What I found were sex, fetish, pain, bondage and submissive checklists. I was immediately intrigued. Over the course of several more drinks I filled out each of the checklists. I found I spent the most time going over the submissive checklist, not just because it was several pages long but because I kept rating the items then going back and changing my rating. The more I thought about the things listed on the checklist happening to me the more excited and horny I got. I even went to the extent of editing the lists to add additional items that only my wild imagination could ever have thought of in the first place. In my drunken horniness I decided to email Chris my filled out checklists. From that point on we have always been very open with each other.
It was only the next morning when sobriety had come that my embarrassment struck. My face was red as I reviewed the lists and realized I had emailed them out. Looking at the list sober I realized that in my drunken emotional state I was too into the moment and scored almost everything higher then how I normally feel about them. There were items on the list that were so perverse I couldn&#8217;t believe I had even answered them. Although everything tended to be scored higher then I thought I really felt about them I couldn&#8217;t deny that all my answers were honest. To be kind to myself all the checklists showed that I was extremely open minded to say the least. 
Few people truly understand me and how my mind works. Looking at the lists sober I saw items that I answered when I should have deleted them. The items were so perverse a normal person wouldn&#8217;t even want them included on the list even if they didn&#8217;t rate the item as being something they would never consider trying. Of course some of those were the ones I had added. But I was different, I didn&#8217;t delete those, I answered them or came up with them.
Everyone is supposed to have a mythical angle and devil perched on their shoulders guiding their decisions. The character of a person is determined by which of the two have the loudest voice. To understand why I make the decisions I make you have to realize that my little devil is always present, whispering encouragements to push things a little further into the next extreme all the time. My angel however is completely absent. She&#8217;s bound, ball gagged and locked away in the darkest depths of my mind.
My devil made me answer even the most perverse answers. With no angel guiding my judgments everything begins to sound fun. Sometimes I knew I didn&#8217;t like the item but I still put a moderate score on it. I got off on the feeling I got from answering it, I enjoyed thinking about other people reading my answer and what they would think of me. Even the thought of being in a bondage situation where someone might be using this list with these answers excited me. On a perverse level I loved the idea of being forced to do the acts I knew I would hate.
Back to the present. Now that we were living near each other Chris and I had begun to discuss the possibility of actually meeting up and experimenting with some bondage. From our conversations and the stories I&#8217;ve written, Chris knew I have always been interested in actually experiencing a bondage challenge scenario. Chris on the other hand has always had a passion to see someone put through one of these elaborate bondage scenarios. Chris has always enjoyed reading my stories because of the boundaries they push and the scenes they entail, many of which he never considered before. In our emails he has also come up with some creative scenarios that I have never thought of before and in return have used in a few of my stories. 
Ultimately it was our similar tastes in bondage challenges that had led us to develop such an open friendship. A great bondage story for us involved the main character forced to go through a series of events that involved some kind of risk in order to gain their freedom. Sometimes that character was forced by another person to do something risky but most of the time it was a single person putting them self in bondage then usually do something that might expose themselves in order to retrieve a key.
Chris wasn&#8217;t the only person I could have chosen to test my bondage desires with. As an author I have met an enormous number of people online. I&#8217;ve had countless offers from people who enjoyed my stories who have offered to help me experience the fantasies I&#8217;ve written about. I also keep a user profile on several adult websites to try to meet locals but I&#8217;ve never taken any of them up on there offers. I could have had my first real bondage encounter with any number of people across the globe or even locally but Chris was the only on I felt comfortable with. He already knew my dirtiest secrets.
After long deliberation we finally decided to meet up and try something. We decided to put my creativity on hold for a change and let Chris come up with his own unique scenario for me to try. I wanted him to surprise me with a bondage challenge where I would be forced to do something to get free. I wasn&#8217;t just looking to be tied up in one place and spanked then untied after a time period. I wanted to be tied up and forced to do something or go somewhere to free myself. Not knowing what the challenge would be added to the thrill. I told Chris I didn&#8217;t want to know what the challenge was and what I would be forced to do to gain my freedom until after I was already tied up and it was too late to back out. 
Chris agreed to my request for a mystery bondage challenge but had me go back through my old checklists and send them to him. Going though my files I quickly found the checklists and rescored everything. Based off the checklists he would come up with an appropriate scenario. I pressed the fact with Chris that this was the first time I had done anything like this and that we needed to start small. With this in mind I went back scored everything. Given just how open I tended to be to most of what was on the list I was worried Chris might come up with a scenario that was far too extreme for a first time experience. This time around my scores were low. I completely removed all the public stuff like outdoor bondage, public nudity and all the extreme sex stuff like double penetration, prostitution and so on. Whether I had any interest in it or not I simply deleted the items from the checklist.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;My stomach churned from excitement and fear when the day finally came. Chris had sent me a location to meet at and a specific set of instructions that I had to follow. It was late in the afternoon and I was in my car driving to one of the local malls. I left directly from work not wanting to waist any time running home. In addition to my excitement rushing me towards my upcoming bondage challenge that Chris was going to put me through I also wanted to beat traffic. It was 4pm and the Friday traffic jam had already begun. Monday was a holiday and it seemed like everyone was heading out the door already. 
As instructed in the letter I headed to the part of the parking lot that was shared by the mall and a grocery store. The mall was packed with shoppers spending their pay checks. The grocery store was also crowded with people buying supplies for this weekends BBQ&#8217;s. A hand full of people walked through the parking lot in their transition between store and car.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It wasn&#8217;t too hard to find Chris&#8217;s truck with the camper on the back parked near the front of the grocery store. There were no open spots near his rig. I drove down the isle till I found an empty stall. I milled about in my car for a second waiting for a nearby woman to get into her car. There was no way for her to know what I was about to go into the store to buy but somehow even being seen going in embarrassed me. Once she had driven off I got out of my car and locked it. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As instructed, my first order of business was to head into the grocery store. Chris knew that in addition to having a taste for exhibitionism I was also extremely self-conscious about buying anything sex related in public. I have in the last few years amassed a sizable goody bag of naughty toys and attire but all of it has been purchased through the anonymity of the internet. My first task was meant to play off of both those emotions. Heading towards the pharmacy section I quickly found what I was looking for. I tried to suppress my embarrassment as I picked out two mega packs of condoms. One flavored, the other super lubricated. 
I&#8217;m a good looking guy. I can usually catch girls glancing over at me any time I&#8217;m out in public. Picking up two jumbo packs of condoms gained me even more attention than normal. I wanted to die as I picked up the last item of Chris&#8217;s grocery list. Along with condoms I had to buy lube and not just any lube, Anal-Eze lube. Chris even specified which size to get. Anal-Eze is bad enough to be seen buying but Chris wanted me to get the economy bottle. The bottle that was extra large to begin with and now had 30% more free. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Several people were glancing over at me as I picked up the last of my grocery list. I tried my best to ignore them but it just made me blush more. Walking to the front I found the shortest line and did my best to cover up the labels on my items. My eyes were locked straight ahead. I didn&#8217;t want to turn around and look at all the people checking me out. Holding everything as I walked through the line I didn&#8217;t set anything on the conveyor belt until the gal behind the counter was ready to take them and swipe them. I paid for my purchase and tried to ignore the people watching me walk out with condoms and lube. 
I paused as I approached the rear of the camper. This was the moment of truth and I couldn&#8217;t help but hesitate. Looking around I found myself alone in the parking lot which was a good thing since I didn&#8217;t want to advertise the fact I was getting into the back of the camper. I seriously thought about getting back in my car and calling the whole thing off but I couldn&#8217;t make up my mind. I would have lingered there a lot long if it weren&#8217;t for the fact I saw another car entering the parking lot. I decided to get into the camper while no one was looking and if I changed my mind I could always get back out. 
The camper was empty of people just as Chris said it would be. Part of the instructions said he would wait in the mall and that I was to get into the camper while he was gone. I was in his camper now but I still had the choice to back out if I wanted to. Looking over on the table I saw the stack of papers right where Chris said it would be. Chris had printed off all of the checklists I had days before redone and sent to him. 
The top sheet of the stack was a contract agreement he wanted me to sign. It was a slave agreement that dictated how long I agreed to be a slave and that I was comfortable with everything on the checklists. I put the top sheet aside and flipped through the checklists. A familiar feeling of excitement began to build in me as I looked at the list of things I had filled out and showed interest in. My cock grew had reading the list of things I had told Chris he could do to me. It wasn&#8217;t any where near as dramatic as the original list but was still wild enough to allow for a good time.
My concentration was broken by the sound of a shopping cart being slammed into the return area just outside the window. I could just barely see the person through the thin curtains as they disposed of their cart. They were no more then five feet away from me as I held onto a list of all my sexual desires. My fear was quickly turning to excitement.
Part of the instructions Chris had given to me was for me to strip naked in the camper. I wasn&#8217;t ready to fully commit yet but starting with my shirt I slowly disrobed till I was standing naked with only the thin curtains concealing me from the people walking around outside. I looked at the door and got a sick feeling seeing it was unlocked but that was part of the instructions. If I couldn&#8217;t handle it now I wouldn&#8217;t be able to handle it later. My cock was fully erect as this point and I couldn&#8217;t help but stroke my raging hard on.
Seeing all the people walking around outside while I stood naked inside the camper only added to my growing excitement. Flipping through the checklists I was a little disappointed to find I had given public exposure the lowest score possible. I was now relishing in the thought of being seen and slightly regretted not giving that option I higher score. 
A growing sensation in my cock began to take control of my body. I had to focus my mind to keep from blowing my load right there. I was undeniably excited and a few hard strokes away from cuming. Looking back at the contract I grabbed the pen Chris had laid out and quickly started writing on the paper. This was the first time I had experienced this kind of arousal and high since the days when I first started writing about sex and bondage. 
One of the first things to agree on in the contract was its duration. Chris and I had never actually set a time period. Instead he told me to write down whatever I was comfortable with and that he would adjust the scenario accordingly. Although we never actually picked a time the general idea would be a 3-7 hour scenario.
Part of the reason we had picked this weekend over any other was because we both had busy schedules and this weekend being a three day weekend allowed us the extra time needed to play and still get our normal weekend activities done. On impulse I decided to put midnight Monday as the end time. Today was only Friday but suddenly the thought of being forced to do things all weekend long was too irresistible to pass up. Realistically I knew Chris wasn&#8217;t likely to be able to make his plan last past midnight tonight and we would call it quiets then but the buzz I got from putting Monday down was too strong to pass up.
Most of the contract listed that I understood what was going on and everything else. I skimmed through it as I looked for the parts I had to fill out. I knew in the checklists I had taken out the items about multiple partners, group sex and anything else that would involve other people but being out in this public place was really playing on my exhibitionist tendencies. There was a blank to list who the slave is supposed to belong to. Instead of putting Chris&#8217;s name I simply put �all parties� hoping he might find a way to bring someone else into our little play session. 
I eagerly finished filling out the contract then signed it. I restacked all the papers into one neat pile before replacing them on the table. I set the two boxes of condoms and the bottle of lube next to the contract like Chris&#8217;s note instructed. My mind was made up; I was going to follow through.
In the middle of the small camper there was a ring imbedded in the floor. Beside it the locks and chains I was supposed to put on. Kneeling down over the ring I began to put on everything Chris had left for me. I started with the ring gag. The ring was a full 2� and stretched my mouth the limit. The ring was part of a full head harness. I wrapped the straps over and behind my head buckling them all as I went. The chin strap came last. Thinking about the fact I had just strapped a ring gag in my jaw knowing I was going to lock myself up and wait for another man to come find me only made my cock harder. 
Drool began to ooze out my open mouth and drip down my chest. I tried not to think about what Chris might do once he sees me with mouth poised open. We&#8217;ve never actually talked about having sex. We both prefer woman but I can&#8217;t say for sure he would pass up an inviting mouth. Deep down I hoped his plans for me only entailed me being tied up. Although the thought of being forced to suck a man&#8217;s dick has always turned me on the idea of doing it has always disgusted me. 
Picking up the short chain that was laying on the ground I used one of the open locks and locked the chain around my waist. Shuffling around, I turned till I was kneeling facing the unlocked door, this was all part of the instructions. I was at a point of no return. Aside from the chain locked around my waist that would require a hacksaw to remove there was nothing preventing me from leaving. Mentally I was on a high that was even better then that first story I posted. Emotionally I was a mix of shear terror and immeasurable excitement. The high I was on dwindled slightly as the familiar deep gut feeling that this was a bad idea began to strike. That gut feeling told me I needed to leave here with the papers in hand and head for a hardware store to buy that hacksaw. At the same time doing just this little bit had put me on a high that was exceeding anything else I&#8217;ve ever felt and that was a lot to walk away from. Be it my stupidity, my addictive nature to always want more or possibly even my self destructive ways that made me put myself in risky situations, regardless, without thinking I took the slack end of the chain locked around my waist and locked it to the floor.
Click. My brain was back to reality. I looked around then down at the floor not really believing I was the one who had just snapped the lock shut. As though my hands were guided by an invisible force, they had just locked me to the floor without me telling them to do it. The devil on my shoulder made me do it. There was no other voice for me to listen to. I tried to stand up but the ring in the floor had no give to it. Now I was officially committed. I had no keys to the locks and no way of breaking the chain. I was locked to the floor by the chain around my waist and I was sitting too far from the door to lock it. Nothing prevented someone from walking right in and finding me. 
The thought suddenly struck me that this might have been Chris&#8217;s plan for me all along. I lock myself in his camper and he lets his friends come use me all night long. Of course in this position it wouldn&#8217;t even have to be his friends. Chris could sit around the corner and pimp me out. He could be soliciting me to strangers right now taking fifty bucks a shot for a guy to come in here and face fuck me. This could all be his version of my Lost In Translation story only instead of a fiction female locked in a theater waiting for the world to come fuck her this was me in a trailer waiting to be discovered.
Rationality slowly returned. Chris wouldn&#8217;t do that to me. It was one thing to talk about doing that to a fictional character or talk about it as a fantasy but it&#8217;s too far fetched for someone to actually carry through on. I reassured myself by reminding myself that Chris had specifically asked me to refill out the checklists. There was no denying or hiding the fact that I had tamed them way down and that they didn&#8217;t really reflect how I felt about everything but again why would Chris go through the effort of the checklist and that contract if he wasn&#8217;t planning to follow it? As I kept re-asking myself these questions I slowly regained my confidence. 
Picking up the handcuffs from the floor I locked one cuff around my left wrist. With the cuff dangling I picked up the blindfold from the floor and placed it over my eyes. With the blindfold in place I reached both arms behind my back. My self destructiveness was in overdrive. If I was about to get pimped out I may as well have no control at all. The thought of one guy after another coming in here to cum in my mouth made my penis drip with pre-cum and sent waves of exhilarations through my body. My heart fluttered from fear and my hands shook with excitement. 
Always aware of people&#8217;s perceptions of my image I had unbeknownst to Chris decided to add a little something to this adventure. Reaching over to where my pants lay crumpled on the floor I fished through my pants pocket till I found a small baggy. Being my first time in bondage I was worried that at some point my fear might lead to certain &#8216;performance issues&#8217;. Like any other guy I wanted to look my best and be fully at attention for the entire bondage challenge. 
Drugs are easy to come by around her and I had no problem getting four special blue pills. These weren&#8217;t the original V&#8217; pill but the other one. They were design to provide less intensity but for a longer period of time. V&#8217;s last for ten hours with strong results, these last for about 36 hours with more mild results. Of course that is based off results in elderly patients. Popping all four pills in my mouth I suddenly realized I should have taken these before I put on the ring gag. It was a struggle but I managed to swallow them. 
In the back of my mind I knew this was a bad idea but the devil that influences my thoughts never says to do anything that is a good idea. I knew I would probably leave tonight still erect and that I would probably be sitting in my apartment on Monday still dealing with uncomfortable erections but I just couldn&#8217;t resist. I loved the idea that no matter how scared or turned off I might end up tonight, to anyone looking at me I will be rock hard on a sexual high and raring for more. Grabbing the open cuff I slowly squeezed it around my right wrist. Again it was the devil on my shoulder influencing my thoughts as once again I thought of random people coming in her to use me only now they will be finding me fully erect as they fuck me.
Repetitive clicking echoed in the small space as the cuff ratcheted around my wrist. The cold steel encircled my wrist till it pressed down on all sides. I stopped ratcheting and gave my wrist a tug. Both cuffs were too small around my wrists to pull off. These cuffs were locked on and so was the chain around my waist that held me to the floor. A shiver ran down my spine. I wouldn&#8217;t be leaving this place till Chris came at a time of his own choosing and released me. 
The clear sound of two guys talking as they walked through the parking lot drifted into the camper. My skin felt icy cold as a slight draft wafted through. For the first time I realized the windows on the sides of the camper were open. All though I had been able to see through the thin curtains they were enough of a distraction to conceal the fact the windows were slid open. The voices grew louder; the words were easy to make out as they flowed in unobstructed by the open window. 
My mind went back to the unlocked door. Even if Chris didn&#8217;t send people to me, enough people had seen me leave the store with condoms and lube that I could easily have ended up with a few people curious enough to investigate what I was up to. I hadn&#8217;t seen anyone loitering in the parking lot when I got in here but that didn&#8217;t necessarily mean no one had hid out of sight behind a car to spy on me or simply were standing inside the store and saw me get into the back of a camper. 
As thought I had just reach the initial peak on a roller coaster and was staring down the steep decent my heart raced, my stomach turned and my body shook. As the voices reached the door I felt like I had just started to hurdle down that drop. My heart stopped dead as I waited for the door to open. The immense relief that comes just after you reach the bottom of that first drop came to me only after the voices had passed well beyond the door. 
With their voices fading into the distance my mind began to compare my current situation to the positions I have put my numerous characters in. In particular I began to ponder over my Lost In Translation story where I left a female character tied in place bent over a row of seats in an adult theater. Ring gagged and ass exposed I left her in that theater waiting for people to come in and find her and the five month supply of condoms there with her. I never added a second chapter to that story but maybe that was a good thing right now. Chris seemed to be following the concept of that story in his own creative way. 
My Freedom and Risk plot seemed to also bear a resemblance to this moment. That character had bound themselves in a way that they knew would expose them to possible discovery just like I had when I walked out of the store with condoms and lube in hand. My mind bounced from one story to another. In Holiday Convention the character had tied them selves up in a hotel room and waited for a friend to find them. In the end it was a hotel staff member who not only found them but also wheeled them out of the room on the baggage cart they were bound to and delivered them to the middle of the adult toy convention that was being held in the hotel. 
Chris had managed to figure out a way to make me live out one of the many scenarios I have written about. For the first time I got to actually experience the same feelings as my characters. As my mind calmed down enough to process coherent thoughts I realized I had actually attained a better high then anything I have ever felt. This far exceeded the erotic thrill of writing an explicitly sexual story. This was sexual and scary combined making it immensely more intoxicating. 
I felt like I was in a theme park taking the same ride over and over again. As I heard people approaching from the distance I felt my self climbing that first big hill before I would tumble over it as they walked past. Ultimately I was always relieved to hear the voices pass. The campers immediate proximately to the cart returned ensured that a constant flow of people passed by the camper. Eventually, like riding any ride over and over again, the high began to fade.
There was no way to judge the passing of time. I heard hundreds of carts slam into the return next to the truck and each time I jumped a little. Eventually the sound of cars and carts became less and less frequent. Parking lot traffic died down signaling that it was getting late. I had no way to tell how late of course. My body ached from the lack of movement. This was definitely the longest I&#8217;ve ever been restrained. 
The complete lack of attention and my utter boredom allowed for something I hadn&#8217;t expected. At first I thought that the pills hadn&#8217;t had time to work but then I began to realize they might have been fakes. Maybe getting them was easy for a reason. I had actually managed to lose my erection. I soon found out just how the pills work. All alone and with a clear mind my erection passed but the slightest breeze or even the thought of sex quickly brought me back to a full erection. Even thoughts that would normally turn me off were enough to keep me erect. I smiled to myself knowing my plan was working.
Foot steps passed through the parking lot like so many others. The sudden silence of the steps made me hold my breath. Whoever was walking through the parking lot had just stopped in front of this camper. My emotions were back at the top of the roller coaster but this time I was expecting a different ride. The door creaked open and my emotions tumbled down the tracks but his time I wasn&#8217;t sure where the bottom of the hill was at. 
The camper dropped as the person stepped in. The door slammed shut. Still ring gagged and locked to the floor, I now had a roommate in this tiny camper. My blind fold was removed and I got a glimpse of who had just walked in. It was a white man in his mid thirties. I recognized him from his messenger photo and realized Chris had finally returned.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; From his pocket he pulled out a set of dog tags. He held them up for me to read. Inscribed on the silver tags were the words Colonel Cock Sucker. Once I had read them Chris put the tags around my neck. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Since I know you love to have your character post some kind of sexual note along with their bondage I thought it was fitting you had your own,� Chris said. Chris reached over to the table and picked up the stack of papers.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�uunkks,� I tried to thank him.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Awesome, you signed it. That means you&#8217;re officially my slave,� he said as he held up the contract. �Oh, I wasn&#8217;t expecting that. You put Monday night as the end date. I wasn&#8217;t really planning for that, I really didn&#8217;t think that&#8217;s what you were looking for.� 
Chris looked surprised as well as a little less confident. His face was a mix of emotions. There was the initial shock of seeing something he had never expected along with a little loss of confidence from being under prepared for it as well as feeling bad for miss interpreting what he thought was my original intentions. As the initial shock passed I could also see the wheels turning as he realized he could expand his original short bondage challenge into a more creative longer one.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I smiled behind my gag, mostly at myself for being horny enough to actually put that but also because it was fun to see the surprised look on Chris&#8217;s face. It felt good to see he wasn&#8217;t expecting that and to know I had done something unexpectedly wild for him to be ready for. I felt proud knowing that the time period I had put down was longer then whatever scenario he could have come up with. I enjoyed knowing that in my submission I could be the dominate one by showing I was more daring then he was. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Chris&#8217;s facial expression changed as he read through the contract. That initial excitement over the prolonged duration faded.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I guess you must think I&#8217;m going to need to get some help to keep you entertained all weekend since you put down &#8216;All parties&#8217; as your owner,� Chris said looking a little hurt. �Of course, seeing as the lists you sent back were altered to the point that anything even moderately risky doesn&#8217;t even show up on the list I have to wonder if your desire to give control to other people is because even after all the time we&#8217;ve know each other you just don&#8217;t trust me enough to be alone with me.� He paused, �You know, that kind of hurts a little thinking despite how open I have always been with you that you might not trust me.�
Actually he looked more than a little hurt. I didn&#8217;t mean to make him feel bad when I put down that I would be a slave all weekend. I knew when I put it down that he wasn&#8217;t planning for anything like that but mostly I did it just for my own thrill of knowing it was on a signed contract. Admittedly I knew when I did it that putting down that I wanted this to last longer then he was prepared for would make him feel a little inept and I did enjoy that but that wasn&#8217;t the main reason I put that down. 
�Well, I suppose it&#8217;s not that big of a deal to not have you all to myself to play with. If that is what you&#8217;re interested in I&#8217;ll work with it. If you want to see what other people can come up with instead of just me I guess I can live with it. Seeing as you&#8217;re an author who has taken input on his stories and co-authored other stories you&#8217;re probably used to letting people give you ideas and take control of your work. Personally I&#8217;d enjoy having all three days to try out all my ideas but if you want to try other people out I guess I just have to limit myself to my best ideas and try to squeeze in as many as I can. I guess if you can learn to step back and let other people take over your work I can do the same and let other people take control of you. Swallowing a little pride, I guess I could see where bringing in some other people to help me with your bondage could be useful. I do have to admit I have seen some of your work go from a piece of fine art and morph into a masterpiece when you&#8217;ve worked with other people. On the bright side of things, if you want to experience being with other people I&#8217;ll actually have a chance to get a little sleep in the next three days.�
Chris&#8217;s expression had changed. Mostly I could see he was hurt but I could also see a touch of anger starting to show through on his face. It wasn&#8217;t the anger of a man ready to fight but that of a little kid who was picked last in the sports lineup. Not so much picked last but not picked by one of the team captains who was supposed to be his best friend. Now instead of being on his friend&#8217;s team first pick he was last pick on someone else&#8217;s team. He was now determined to beat that friend and prove why he was better then everyone else.
Chris didn&#8217;t look at me as he slipped my blindfold back over my eyes that were now practically bulging out of their sockets. I heard paper being ripped apart then crumpled up. The only paper I had seen in here was the contract and the various checklists I had filled out. 
I guess I must have hurt him worse than I thought if he was going to tear up the contract and call this all off. It will all be ok though. After all this was just a misunderstanding. Once he takes this gag off me I&#8217;ll be able to talk to him and everything will be fine. Actually, him being hurt and tearing everything up is probably best. Once I talk to him I know I can explain everything and he will be fine. Once I mellow him out we can write up a new contract which I will only be putting tonight down on and then we can still try something out. Just the thought of being tied up for three days was hard to think about so having the opportunity to rectify that came as a blessing.
The sound of paper being dropped on the table surprised me. This wasn&#8217;t the tinkle of ripped up, crumpled up pages. The smack I heard was distinctly that of a stack of papers being dropped.
�Sorry for asking you to refill out those checklists again. I did it when I couldn&#8217;t find them thinking I had accidentally deleted them. I searched every where for the originals on my computer but couldn&#8217;t find them. At first I felt really bad having to ask you for them again thinking I had thrown something out that you had given me. Of course it doesn&#8217;t seem that you felt they were important enough to keep the originals either. The ones you sent me look like they came off a different site. Those questions were only a fraction of the original list. I don&#8217;t really understand why but it didn&#8217;t look like you even took the time to change the answers on the ones you copied. You just seemed to copy and send it. Seeing how different those answers were to what yours were really bugged me. Ever since I got your email I have been searching my computer to try and find your original checklists. It wasn&#8217;t until today when I was waiting for you to show up that it dawned on me where I still had them saved.�
My heart skipped a beat.
�You owe me big time. If you weren&#8217;t gagged right now I know you would be giving me a big thank you. Since you are gagged I can let the lack of gratitude slide. I&#8217;m not even sure what triggered my memory. I was just walking through the mall when I suddenly remembered. Call it luck or maybe even divine intervention but about an hour after I left here I remembered I still had your original email saved on my online account. You should know that just for you I hiked half way across town to find an internet caf�. I risked being seen in public with your crazy checklists when I was printing these off.�
I heard the clink of a stapler biting into a thick stack of papers.
 �Just so you know, my originally intent in printing this out was to prove I hadn&#8217;t deleted it. I really wanted to try and impress you with the fact I would never throw away something of yours even the stuff that you sent me such a long time ago. I guess I was stupid to try and impress you but at least some good will come of my hard work and dedication. Now that we have your new contract added to your original checklists I can now turn you over to anyone blindly and rest assured that they will understand the full depth and extent of your kinky mind. Seeing as you&#8217;ve decided you want to be the slave of other people who don&#8217;t know you, this checklist should help them come up with the most suitable experiences for your tastes by opening up a lot more provocative avenues to try and explore then that first list allowed for.�
The camper rocked as Chris moved through it. The door opened and the camper rose as he stepped out. There was a long pause as I waited for the door to slam shut.
�Don&#8217;t worry about thanking me. We have three days for me to figure out how you&#8217;re going to repay me. I have plenty of ideas of things I&#8217;d love to see you do as my reward for my effort. Narrowing it down to just one will be the hard part. Of course you have to admit I did go through a lot of effort for you to get all this. Maybe my reward should be better than getting just one thing. I&#8217;ll have to give that some thought.�
The door slammed shut and once again I was all alone in the camper. Once again I strained to break free of the cuffs but the metal wouldn&#8217;t give. For the first time I felt a chill. Suddenly I was very well aware of my complete nakedness as a breeze drifted through the camper. Footsteps walked around the camper. A door opened then the camper rocked. Immediately after the door slammed shut the engine coughed to life. Catching myself before I toppled over I had to shift my weight to compensate for the moving vehicle. Chris was on the move and I was locked in back along for the ride. 




Chapter 2: The journey begins

Blinded by the leather wrapped around my eyes I had the no way to know when the camper would accelerate or brake. Staying on my knees was a challenge when the camper suddenly took a sharp corner. If not for the chain securing me to the floor I would have surely flown into the air as Chris drove across a speed bump. 
Still in high gear my mind was running through a gauntlet of emotions. Fear was much stronger now then it was before but my raging hard on proved I was still aroused. My physical situation hadn&#8217;t changed much but the few minor changes had the potential to have a drastic impact on my future. I was still completely naked, chain to the floor of an unlocked camper and blindfolded. The ring gag head harness that I had personally put on was still holding my mouth wide open. The flavored condoms I had purchased were still only a few feet away form my open mouth along with another box of lubricated condoms and a giant bottle of desensitizing anal lube which would beckon anyone who saw them to check out my exposed ass. 
The one minor change to my physical surroundings was the stack of papers placed next to the condoms and lube. Normally a stack of papers are nothing to fret except this stack had some of the most depraved sexual acts known to man inscribed on them. These checklists weren&#8217;t a list that I myself wrote up. It wasn&#8217;t a table of items and things that happened to be on my mind that I thought would be interesting to try. My lists that I had filled out were the result of a global culmination of perverted minds who had combined forces to create lists of not just the things they were all interested in but of every sexual act they could think of. With a plethora of demented minds pooling resources the completed checklists were thorough to say the least.
Here I kneed in the back of a camper, being driven around by a person I had only just met, locked in place with a signed slave contract and the checklist that I had filled out in my drunken horniness years before. I had marked a high interest on half the stuff even through I wasn&#8217;t sure what it was all because it sounded interesting. All that had changed were the words on the paper. Given that I had just gone from tying myself up and leaving control of myself in the hands of a friend to now where I was a slave to a hurt and angry stranger, those words could have a very strong influence on what the future had in store for me.
Driving down the road air whipped in through the open windows. The cold I felt from fear was amplified by chilled night air across my skin. I shivered even though I really wasn&#8217;t that cold. With no way to tell time and being blinded to the world passing by I had no way to judge how far we had traveled before the vehicle came to a stop.
Suddenly the engine was quiet. Creaking hinges and the slamming of a door revealed that Chris had gotten out. I prepared myself for the camper door to open but it never did. Chris&#8217;s footsteps disappeared into the distance. Once again I was alone in an abandoned vehicle. I couldn&#8217;t help but wonder if this time Chris did plan to park me somewhere and start pimping me out. He could make dollar after dollar letting one person after another come into the seclusion of his camper and use me for their satisfaction. 
How many times have I written a story where a character is put into a position where the ending of the story can only lead to a long night of fucking with or without their consent? Every story I wrote inevitable led to the main character being discovered and either humiliated or black mailed and enslaved. Chris could be looking at all that in any number of ways.
The heavy clank of a cart passing by surprised me. It was familiar but different from that of the light weight shopping carts I had been listening to all day. I was puzzled that we would end up back at a shopping center. Public parking lots didn&#8217;t make for the most secluded area for people getting in an out of a camper. As another one passed by I realized it was one of the heavy duty flat carts like the ones you find at a hardware store. Ropes, chains, locks and all sorts of other hardware began to fill my mind. Hardware stores are the Mecca of bondage supplies. 
Foot steps approached but I heard no cart. A door opened followed by the familiar rock of the vehicle. Chris had returned and we were soon driving again. My mind raced trying to pick clues from what Chris had said when he was in here to try and figure out what he might have needed to buy. While my mind churned over the possibilities Chris continued to drive. He drove and drove and drove for what felt like hours taking more turns then I could possibly count. 
Eventually the truck did stop. The driver&#8217;s door opened and this time the camper door followed suit. Expecting the truck to shift from Chris&#8217;s weight as he entered the camper I steadied myself but the vehicle never moved. From the direction of the door way I heard the electronic chime of a digital camera snapping a photo. Chris was photographing me naked and bound. I had definitely removed taking pictures from the list I had revised but I knew it was on the original. There was now evidence that I was into bondage in the hands of someone else. 
�I know most people would have a major problem getting pictures taken of them in the position you&#8217;re in right now but since you are so insistent on bringing in other people to see and play with you I can&#8217;t imagine you&#8217;d have a problem with me documenting everything. I seem to recall your original list having &#8216;degrading photos&#8217; taken of you rated moderately well liked and judging by the ErectoMeter I&#8217;m looking at, it should have been rated higher. Well even if the rating was wrong that ought to make for an even more convincing photo,� he said as he took a few more shots.
The thought of the pictures was enough to get me hard again. As much as I would love to claim that my erection was entirely the result of the �magic� blue pills I had taken I couldn&#8217;t. On some level it excited me. The pills just massively amplified the result of that arousal.
�Oh, and don&#8217;t worry about where the pictures will end up. I&#8217;ll be very discrete with who I share them with.� He snickered a little as he said it. �Speaking of, and getting back to the topic of you wanting to bring other people into your bondage weekend, I only personally know of a few people in the area who might be interesting in playing with you. You know I&#8217;d really feel bad if I let you down and disappointed you with a lame weekend. I&#8217;m afraid the only way to keep from risking letting you down and to guarantee that you have some more play partners is to go onto all the adult personal sites like bondage.com, alt.com and fetishfriendfinder.com. I&#8217;m pretty sure if I go onto several of those sites and send a few pictures of you to everyone living in the area I&#8217;ll be able to find you some friends. If all else fails this is Seattle, there are always the fetish bars we can stop by.�
 Chris entered and I soon heard the click of a lock opening. He had unlocked me from the ring in the floor. He helped me to my feet and led me out of the camper. I had no way to know where I was with the blindfold still blocking my vision but there wasn&#8217;t much point in fighting. With or without my help he could easily force me out. Chris&#8217;s sudden change in attitude frightened me. I was still pretty sure he would come back around once he had mellowed out a little but I definitely didn&#8217;t want to do anything that might agitate him more than he already was.
Stepping out the back of the camper my bare feet fell on rough concrete. Chris moved me away from the truck before stopping me. He tapped the insides of my legs and kept tapping them till my feet were at least two feet apart. I tensed up thinking I was about to be bent over and fucked in the ass. Emotionally I was filled with dread and excitement. I was embarrassed by the thought of being ass fucked by a guy but still turned on by it. Not knowing what he was going to do to me scared me but aroused me thinking of the possibilities.
Around my right ankle I felt him tying rope. On the back of my ankle, secured by the rope I could feel something pressing into my skin. Soon my other ankle was being wrapped with rope. When he finished I had the same uncomfortable pressing feeling in the back of my ankle. I heard him stand up and turn around to walk back towards the camper. I tried to move my legs closer together by found they were held apart. The uncomfortable pressure was a spreader bar tied in place. 
I heard something that sounded like a bottle getting set on the ground along with another sound I couldn&#8217;t make out. Chris turned me around and had me walk back in the direction of the trailer. Holding onto my waist chain with one hand he used his other to push my upper body over. My upper body went past parallel to the ground but Chris kept pushing. Even with him pulling my lower body back I was on the verge of tipping over. Finally with my head nearly level with my knees my forehead touched the carpet of the camper. Chris let go and moved off but I was stuck in place. My balance was too off to stand back up and with my legs held apart there was no way to regain my balance. I heard the distinct sound of a cap flipping up. With out looking I knew the bottle of lube Chris had me purchase was now open. 
�Seeing how hard your dick is I know you&#8217;re getting pretty excited but don&#8217;t get your hopes up just yet there Davie,� Chris said from behind me. �You&#8217;re going to have to wait a little while longer before you get your favorite fuck hole stuffed with a penis. I thought that it would be prudent that if your ass is going to be used for an entire weekend that I had better get you really well lubed. I stopped at the hardware store to get a funnel to pour this lube into you but just couldn&#8217;t pass up buying one of those grease guns for car axels. I&#8217;m betting this two foot hose was originally meant to get you into all those hard to reach places under a car. Something tells me its creator never designed it with this length with the intent to reach the depths that this one will be traveling to but I&#8217;m sure we can make it work.�
I could hear a metal cap being unscrewed then nothing. For a while I couldn&#8217;t hear what Chris was doing. High pitched gasps of air erupted behind me eventually becoming flatulent bursts. A bottle of liquid was being squeezed out behind me. Now nearly empty Chris squeezed and squeezed to get the last of it out. He kept this up for a while before the bottle was completely empty. The bottle whistled cleanly as the air moved in and out with out even a drop of liquid coming with it. Even with out the gag holding my mouth open my jaw would be dropped. The bottle of lube Chris had me buy wasn&#8217;t small my any means. We&#8217;re talking about the size of an economy shampoo bottle if you want to compare it to something. The fact you could get lube in such bulk quantities was surprising enough but that a grocery store would carry it just seemed bizarre. That fact it existed was odd enough, that Chris was able to empty the entire thing out was absolutely shocking. He had just drained a two year supply.
Quiet metallic shrieks echoed around me as Chris re-screwed the cap on the gun. The cold tip of the hose pressed firmly against my puckered ass hole. Instinctively my muscles clench from the unexpected pressure. Behind me I heard a clack, clack as the lever on the grease gun was pumped. Short bursts of air blew on my puckered hole as the guns piston and hose were purged of air and filled with the liquid. Designed to pump thick axel grease the gun had no difficulty pumping the runny anal lube. On the fourth clack of the pump a load of lube shot out of the end of the hose. Part of it made it inside of me but most of it just shot between my butt cheeks and eventually began to run down my legs.
Without warning the tip of the hose pushed past my hole and entered me. The tip itself wasn&#8217;t all that large but the sudden intrusion still caused pain in my tight muscles. My greasy ass did little to slow the tube as it was fed inside of me. I could feel the cold tip of the hose as it traveled deep into my empty rectum. At the start of the day I had made sure I was empty and clean. I had eaten almost nothing all day. The hose traveled unimpaired through my intestine. I winced as I felt a pain just below my chest. The hose was pulled in and out. Each time it was forced back inside me I felt a pain in the same area. If I felt pain just below my chest that meant Chris had stuffed almost a foot of that hose inside my ass. 
His hand pressed on my belly and slowly worked its way around trying to feel the tube inside me. Using shallow strokes Chris thrusts the tube back and forth. Eventually he found the end of the tube by pressing into my stomach in the right spot. Pressing deeper this time Chris jiggled my stomach right where I felt the pain while he simultaneously thrust and spun the tube. Eventually I felt the pain go away but at the same time I felt even more of the hose sliding up my ass. Once again I felt a pain in my stomach only this time it was on the other side. Chris repeated his jiggling maneuver and eventually the tip of the hose rounded what ever corner it had come up against in my stomach and continued on its journey.
I felt the large lube gun press up against my ass. The entire hose was inside me now. I heard the repetitive clack, clack as the gun was pumped and soon felt a pressure building inside my stomach. When I moaned Chris moved his hand to my stomach to feel the section that was now bloated. He rubbed it a little making the pressure go away as the lube pushed into another section of intestine but a couple more pumps of lube and the pain returned. The hose was withdrawn slightly and pumped again. I couldn&#8217;t even begin to guess how long the lube would take before it all worked its way back through my gut and was out of my system. I feared I might be lubed well into the coming week. As the depths of my bowels were filled the hose was withdrawn a little and my intestines were slowly filled up from their depths to my ass. At first I felt cramps like I had just received a massive enema but eventually the cramps went away completely. I could feel my stomach muscles straining from my bloated gut but oddly enough I didn&#8217;t feel the painful cramps and desperate urge to relief myself like I would if I was full of water. I only thing I could guess was the desensitizing medication in the lube was numbing my intestines. 
From behind me I heard the electronic chime of a digital camera snapping a photo. Chris had balanced the grease gun on my back with the end of the rubber tube still buried deeply up my ass. Lube oozed out of my butt and ran down my legs. My rear was beyond well lubed at this point and there was now photographic evidence to prove it later on. To better improve the humiliation of the photo I felt the empty bottle of Anal-Eze being set on my back next to the grease gun.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;My mood lightened as I thought about my situation. Chris had complete control over me. I had no power to stop him from carrying out his most demented ideas on me. Yet with this power and with being supposedly angry with me all he had done was take a few pictures and make my ass the most lubed on the planet. There was an immense list of things he could have easily done that would have been much worse to bear. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;With confidence returning so did my high. With the lube enema I had just received I could get butt fucked for a month straight and still be friction free. His lube enema was creative, kinky and I loved it. His threats of exposing me to the public scared me to the core but tickled me in an erotic way at the same time. I was naked outside, bent over, with a man behind me and had my hands locked behind my back but so far I was fine. My high grew and I indulged myself in its glow.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Ok, maybe I need to take I step back. Seeing that you wanted to bring other people into this hurt me a little. Thinking you thought I wouldn&#8217;t be able to live up to your level of creativity in creating unique scenarios bothered me and I think I might have gone a little overboard. If that&#8217;s the case then I apologize. Let&#8217;s take a second to each get back on the same page and make sure we are seeing eye to eye,� Chris said in a humble tone.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Priiiiing. It was an odd sound, definitely digital but not the chime of a picture being taken. There was no doubt it was the camera but it wasn&#8217;t the sound of a picture snapping. I remembered that I hadn&#8217;t heard Chris originally turn on the camera. I realized he must have just turned it off. If he was putting his camera away that meant this whole thing was a set up. His anger, my original checklist that was years old, his misconstrued belief that I actually wanted to have pictures of me sent out on every adult website. Chris was an absolute genius. I couldn&#8217;t help but admire the brilliance of his scenario. He knew I liked being scared and that the thought of being exposed would turn me on and he played those emotions like a concert musician plays an instrument. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Not only was he playing off my emotions but he was using variations of stories I had written or loved. He was taking the role of the dominate character from several of my favorite stories and playing it perfectly. &#8216;All Within A Dream&#8217;, &#8216;Dirty Dungeon&#8217;, &#8216;Flight Into Reality&#8217;, and so many other stories I love with their submissive character being caught and exposed were all being combined into this scenario Chris had come up with. Chris played his role to a T and I had believed it hook line and sinker. I couldn&#8217;t wait to see what else he would come up with.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Before we actually get your weekend of perversion started let me clear my own conscious and ask you if you want to back out now. If this isn&#8217;t what you&#8217;re interested in you can call it quits right now. So, do you want to stop?� Chris asked.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He had quote unquote come around and mellowed out. Now that he had pushed me as far as he could without actually doing anything he was going to give me a chance to get out. Despite the gag I was smiling. I could see through Chris&#8217;s poker face and I couldn&#8217;t wait to call his bluff.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Vigorously I shook my head no.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�No?� he stated with a surprised tone.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�There is a signed contract in that camper with your name on it. That signed contract says you&#8217;re willing to be a slave for the next three days for any person who holds it. And you know that stapled to it is your checklist with all the dirty nasty things you want to try described on it,� he said, now trying to reemphasize how severe the weekend could get.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Suuuuurrrrrre he had my original checklist. I had sent that to him years ago and suddenly today he remembers he still has it. I can&#8217;t believe this guy had actually managed to outsmart me. He walked in ripped up some papers and claimed to out of the blue resurrect my old checklist and I had bought it. He had fooled me then but now I was onto his game. Now it was my turn to have a little fun with him.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I repeatedly shook my head yes. He had to be sweating bullets now trying to think of what else to say to try to scare me off. Maybe I should let him have his little victory and think he had fooled me but I just couldn&#8217;t. The thought of being out of control but being in control, the fact I could beat him at his own game was too irresistible to pass up. He had played me from the start and now it was time to return the favor.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Aahhh,� he paused �this is what you really want?�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Again my head bobbed back and fourth signaling a yes. There was genuine surprise in his voice. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�So there is no talking you out of this. You really wanted to be bound, abused and fucked for three days and three nights straight. You&#8217;re not just interested in trying the things I can think of, you want me to turn control of you over to other people. Being the slave of as many other people as possible turns you on. You&#8217;re hoping that you can spend an entire holiday weekend experiencing the same scenarios you&#8217;ve written about and enjoy reading,� there was a little annoyance in his voice this time.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This was the icing on the cake. Once again he pretended to be hurt and go off on how he was going to turn me over to other people. Although this was the first time I had met Chris in person one thing I knew from the years of talking to him online was that he was too nice of a person to be cruel and mean to someone just to spite them. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I knew I should probably let Chris win at this point but I just couldn&#8217;t let it go. I&#8217;m just too competitive. I knew the point of this scenario was that he wanted to have me completely psyched out. It was obvious now that his plan was to end the scenario with me begging for freedom which he would have had if you wouldn&#8217;t have shown his bluff. He had me going right up until the point he backed off and pretended to mellow out. 
I have to give him credit though, something like that was necessary for him to go from being angry and transition into the speech about giving me the chance to back out. It was a good idea but poor execution. Someone who was hurt enough to suddenly talk about humiliating you by posting these pictures online could mellow out but there is no way anyone would mellow out the way he did. If that little action was a written story I would say it was a great concept, overall an excellent draft but that it needed just a little more work before the audience bought it. Oh, well. His loss was going to become my gain.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Once again I nodded a yes.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The same pring sound chimed from behind me. The camera was coming back out but I had won. A few final pictures and he would be done. I heard Chris start to chuckle. He must have figured out I knew what he was up to.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I&#8217;ve got to give you credit David and an apology. When I read your story Daring To Be Adventurous I thought the part about the girl being videoed on her cell phone moaning to the guy as he talks about her getting her pussy fucked was fun to read but completely fictional. People being tricked into admitting on video that they were perverts I thought only happened in your stories but you just proved me wrong.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I just realized what that sound was. He didn&#8217;t turn the camera on or off and he wasn&#8217;t taking a picture. That sound was the start and stop of a video recording. This time I moaned profusely trying to talk to Chris.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�You can save your pleas. The camera isn&#8217;t recording anymore. I still can&#8217;t believe that actually worked. I realized when we left the grocery store that even with your little contract as soon as I handed you over to someone else you would fight it and they wouldn&#8217;t believe the contract. If it wasn&#8217;t for you story I would have never even considered the idea that I could trick you into admitting everything on camera. With this little video I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ll have problems doing what you wanted and getting someone to use you to the full limits of that contract whether you are willing or not. Just remember, you were the one who didn&#8217;t want to let me have a solo weekend with you. I&#8217;m just following your desires to fully experience the lifestyle you signed up for.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He started to walk off but came back. �You know the real kicker of it all is none of this would be possible if it weren&#8217;t for you being such an arrogant ass. From the start you had to try and sabotage my plans. First you send back a checklist that a bondage newbie filled out without even taking a little time and effort to at least change the scores on the list. Then you sign the contract but decided I wasn&#8217;t going to provide a good enough experience for you on my own so you wanted me to get help. You know David, you aren&#8217;t the only one who can come up with creative bondage scenarios that no one has thought of or else no one tried because the scenarios were� lets just say too creative. But the best part of all was how easy it was to trick you. I pretended to mellow out and ask for forgiveness but you just threw it in my face. When I pretended I had gone too far you tried to prove you were better then me by asking for more. It&#8217;s ok Dave, I forgive you. After all, you did let me record it on video and now, I have all the blackmail I need to make you do just about anything. So buckle up little boy, you asked to go on a wild ride and I&#8217;m going to give it to you.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;His foot steps moved away then returned. Accompanying their return was something that sounded distinctly like a cow bell. A hand gripped my balls squeezing and stretching them down. I cringed from having my balls forcefully grabbed. I felt something being tied around the base of my ball sack. When he let go with his hand the rope tied around my balls remained. The heavy weight tied on the rope painfully pulled on my balls. The grease gun was picked up off my back. This time the clacking sound of the gun being pumped came much more rapidly. I felt my belly suddenly swell before cold lube began overflowing out of my numb ass hole. The feeling was unmistakable as the lube ran down the insides of my legs. In one swift tug the remaining hose was yanked out of my ass.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Chris stood me back up. I heard him go into the camper then come back out. I could hear him opening boxes. I knew what was coming before he did it. The strap on the head harness that wrapped from the ring gag around the back of my head was loosened. The gag stayed in place held securely by the other straps. Riiiipppp. Chris was breaking the strings of condoms. Given the way I had used this same concept in my Lost In Translation story I was able to guess correctly that the 48 pack of flavored condoms was being separated into four strips of 12 each. 
Two of these strips were placed on each side of the ring gag dangly down my chin as they hung from the strap they were looped over. Now the strap was retightened. The ring slipped a little further into my mouth forcing my jaw open. My head jerk back as Chris tried to pull even tighter before settling on not getting it any tighter and buckling it. Chris now had me ring gagged with a large display of condoms adorning the head harness. I was guaranteed to grab anybody&#8217;s attention having such an inviting target.
Chris chuckled to him self, �If only you had longer hair. Then we could really see one of your stories come to life.�
Even without seeing or hearing what he was doing I knew he wasn&#8217;t done yet. Another box was opened. I couldn&#8217;t see it yet I already knew it was the lubricated condoms. Again the pack of 48 was divided into 4 strips. Chris tucked the strips on my sides under my waist chain just out of reach. Two strips hung from each side. 
Ring gagged, anally lubed and adorned in condoms, he couldn&#8217;t have made my body a bigger target to get fucked. When I wrote about the girl being locked in a theater in a similar position I had a hard on that lasted for nearly a week. Thinking of someone in a position where any stranger who discovered them would think only of fucking them got me off in a major kind of way. Writing that story I imagined myself in that position. Every word I wrote let me live out the fantasy in my mind. Now I was actually living it. It is almost indescribable the high I felt. Fear of pain and humiliation made me desperate to leave as my fight or flight instinct kicked into overdrive. But battling my instinct to run was my desire to know what would come next. From the depths of my kinky mind I yearned to experience the humiliation, to get used and abused. My depraved mind made me crave to get fucked. I knew I would hate it but I desperately wanted to be forced into it.
 A whiff of air passed over me as the door to the camper was shut. Chris then fussed with the back of my head. I could feel a rope across my shoulder and could tell he was tying it to the strap of the blindfold. He walked away again before returning. I heard a metallic clank off to my left. I heard that now familiar chime as Chris snapped off a few more photos. Who would blame him? He had his personal slave Colonel Cock Sucker all tied up and ready for a long weekend of sex and debauchery. He had decorated me with enough condoms to last several days at an orgy party. He would probably be using one of these photos as his new desktop image.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Originally I planned to have you take a naked stroll through a deserted park while your hands were cuffed behind your back. Given the turn of events tonight I felt the need to step up my challenge in order to live up to your extreme standards. I&#8217;m going to drive a little ways away and you are supposed to walk to me once the alarm goes off. Once you walk about thirty feet or so the roped tied to your blindfold should go taunt and you&#8217;ll be able to slip that blindfold off. That&#8217;s it, that&#8217;s the simple bondage challenge that my limited mind came up with. All you have to do is walk to me. Hopefully it doesn&#8217;t disappoint you too much. But rest assured, the whole time you are doing this I&#8217;ll be brain storming an even better challenge for you. I promise it will be even more elaborate and completely unforgettable.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;His foot steps moved away. The engine turned over and the truck slowly pulled away. The engine revved. I wasn&#8217;t sure what he was doing. With an ear piecing screech he peeled out. The noise of the truck disappeared in the distance, the very far distance. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;My high was gone. My ears strained to make out the sound of the truck but I couldn&#8217;t find it. Chris was gone and I was all alone. I had no idea where I was and no way to get free. My legs shook as panic made adrenaline course through my veins.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;With long, concentrated breaths I slowly brought my heart back to a reasonable pace. I knew Chris was playing off my fear and that my fear was now clouding my judgment. One way or another Chris had a plan, I just wasn&#8217;t seeing it right now. It didn&#8217;t make sense that he would completely abandon me, ultimately he got nothing for it. I reconciled myself with the conclusion that he was telling the truth. He had driven away but not off. He was still around and all I had to do was find him. Finding him was the challenge. Chris hadn&#8217;t abandoned me, he was just making it hard for me to find him. Once I got this blindfold off I&#8217;ll be able to get my bearings and then the search will begin. All I had to do was follow his instructions and wait for the timer to go off. Then the search could begin.



Chapter 3: A new bondage challenge

With little else to do but stand around and wait my mind searched for clues as to what Chris&#8217;s bondage challenge might encompass. My current situation was my only clue. I knew he was using ideas form the stories I&#8217;ve written along with the stories I&#8217;ve enjoyed reading. If I could just put the pieces together I would be one step ahead of him which at this moment seemed important. 
Even with Chris feeling hurt and wanting some retribution I knew what ever challenge I was on right now would still follow the same basic idea of his original plan. His anger would make him increase the severity but the overall scenario would be the same. If I could figure it out I might be able to avoid some unpleasant surprises along the way.
Although he claimed my lube enema was for the purpose of an entire weekend of sex the fact his original plan included me buying the abnormally large bottle of lube told me the enema was probably always part of the plan. Part of his original plan was the condoms and dog tags. As Chris had said, the dog tags took the place of the notes I loved to put in my stories. The condoms came straight out of one of my own stories. Both were meant to embarrass a person if they were ever caught and increase the odds of forcing them to have sex with who ever found them. 
Chris had said that his original plan was to have me run naked through an abandoned park with just my hands cuffed behind my back. Now I had a spreader bar tied between my legs which would make running impossible and a weight hanging off my balls that would make any fast movement very painful. 
I was on concrete which meant that I wasn&#8217;t in a park Chris&#8217;s threat to bring in other people meant that there was a good chance I was in an area where there was a strong possibility of someone being around to see me. The fact that he hadn&#8217;t put me out next to a crowd of people meant that he only wanted there to be an increased chance of me being found and not a guarantee of it. With my legs hobbled running for cover if someone comes by will be hard. Having figured all that out I now knew what Chris&#8217;s new challenge was. I was in an area where I could be seen but it was still a chance. I now knew I had to be extra careful about how I moved around.
Beep, beep, beep� A digital alarm clock sounded, the volume nearly deafening. This was Chris&#8217;s signal. The time had arrived when Chris wanted me to start his challenge. Little other encouragement was needed. With the volume cranked to max on the alarm it was bound to get more than just my attention. Deafeningly loud the beeping was as much a beacon calling nearby people in as it was an alarm to mark the time. With cautious steps I moved forward. I had no idea where I was or what was in front of me. 
It only took two steps before a pit formed in my stomach. I knew in Chris&#8217;s anger he had probably relocated me to a place that was semi populated which was bad news for me as I walked around with a ring gag and an attention grabbing quantity of condoms. What I hadn&#8217;t counted on was that Chris had also done something to draw in extra attention. Each step brought with it a chorus of Dings. The weight tried to my balls was a cowbell that noisily clanged back and forth.
Despite my best efforts to walk without ringing the bell I found it was impossible. The pole that separated my legs made taking steps too difficult. I was limited to swaying back and forth jerking my feet forward each time before I completely lost my balance. It wasn&#8217;t exactly the best stride to take to avoid ringing the bell hanging from my balls. Ignoring the loud ringing I continued forward. Chris said in thirty feet I could get the blindfold off which meant I would be able to see where I was at. One step after another I moved forward hoping no one was around to hear the chime of my bell. 
I had taken numerous steps but this one was different. I felt the blindfold pull tight against my eyes as it was stretched in the back. The rope was taunt and the blindfold was ready to be pulled off. Ducking my head down and to the side I let the blindfold slip off. My eyes stung as they adjusted to the light. It was night but I was standing directly under a street lamp. Looking down at my naked body I realized I was completely exposed in the illumination of the light.
Looking from side to side I took in my surroundings. Behind me was a dark secluded alley that I had just exited. Ahead of me was an old brick building. I was currently standing in the middle of a seemingly deserted street. Random street lights illuminated the road with scattered circles of light. The section of road I was standing in being one of those. 
Gazing down the road and over the buildings I tried to pick out a landmark but could find none. I had to be outside of Seattle and in one of the suburbs. Large brick buildings with broken and boarded up windows lined the street that had no traffic. This particular block was an industrial district and not a very nice one by the looks of it. Peering down both directions I searched for Chris. Parked under one of the few working lights I found Chris. He was more than a thousand feet away. I could see him next to his truck. He was standing behind a tripod. Even from here I could see the impressive telephoto lens on the camera.
Given the area we were in I couldn&#8217;t believe Chris was brave enough to stand outside with such an expensive piece of equipment. As abandoned as this placed looked there is always someone around and anyone in this kind of neighborhood could not be good to meet. Movement in the near shadows shifted my attention away from Chris. Each step into the light progressively revealed the man. At first I only saw his shoes but then his legs and slowly up his body. As he approached the light from above revealed him. He wore dirty torn pants and a coat that belonged in a garbage pile. Holding up his hand he waved a dollar bill for me to see. 
I was discovered and worst of all the man was between me and Chris. I thought about running back in the ally that still had the beeping alarm clock but saw there was no safety there. The other direction had no immediate safety either only more dark road. As scary as it was I realized my best chance was to stay right here and hope that the light would scare the bum off long enough for Chris to come and save me. Looking past the man I peered into the darkness to see how much of the distance Chris had managed to cover. Absolute shock took over me. Chris was still in the same spot. He wasn&#8217;t driving to my aid. I saw him bend down to look through the camera and that is when I felt a tear roll down my cheek. At first I thought it was my imagination but eventually I realized my eyes were that good. Right after he bent down a little red light lit up on the camera. Chris was planning to record me getting fucked just like the helpless girl in my Daring To Be Adventurous story.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�This is going to be the best five bucks I&#8217;ve ever made,� the homeless man said as he walked up to me. �Hell, I&#8217;d have fucked you for free.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Looking down I saw my erection was returning. I cursed myself for taking the pills.




Chapter 4: Spiraling out of control

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A fear stronger then anything else I have ever felt overwhelmed my senses. Chris really had gone off the deep end. The anger was no act, it wasn&#8217;t even anger. This was pure rage and it was all focused on me. For the first time in my life I was completely out of control. In my self serving desire to quench my lusting thirst I had empowered a man who was now hell bent on my humiliation and desecration. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Yielding absolute power over me the wild mind that I knew Chris possessed suddenly scared me to the bone. In the years we have been exchanging emails Chris and I have traded an enormous number of fantasies back and forth. Sometimes we would both read a story and talk about where we would have liked to see the story go. Sometimes we would discuss new ideas that one of us had come up with. On several occasions Chris had emailed me an idea that was so dark it was hard for even me to read. He always shrugged it off as being phrased wrong or written under the influence of alcohol. The fact that he hadn&#8217;t sent me anything like that in a long time had made me forget about those dark thoughts he used to write about. Now I was suddenly realizing that those dark thoughts might not have ever gone away. Instead he simply stopped sharing them with me. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The transient continued to approach me. Even though I was clearly bigger and stronger then he, in my conditions I didn&#8217;t stand a chance of fighting back or escaping. His cock was already pulled out of his fly. At five feet I could smell his gut retching stench. My stomach turned. The man hadn&#8217;t bathed since the last rain storm he was caught unprotected in last spring. Looking around the bum my eyes searched for Chris praying he would come to my rescue. The abyss of a pit that had become my stomach grew even deeper seeing Chris was still behind his camera only now he was openly masturbating himself. He was preparing to blow his load as he watched me be forced to take this guy&#8217;s.
WHAP.
A hard hand came from no where and slapped me across the face hard enough to blur my eyes. It took my brain a second to reprocess where I was at let alone that the hand had come from the person I had been looking at the whole time.
�On your knees bitch,� commanded the man.
Out of complete shock I fell to my knees. I didn&#8217;t think about resisting, I didn&#8217;t way my options, I just fell to my knees. I was eye level with this stomach, his raging hard-on pointed straight at me. Reaching down he pulled off one of the many condoms hanging from my head harness. I watched as not more than a foot away from my face a man slowly rolled the condom down the length of his cock. 
Little time was wasted once the condom was rolled on. His dirty, smelly hands reached behind my head and pulled me towards his out thrust dick. I couldn&#8217;t turn away, nor could I do anything to cover my open mouth. His prick easily slipped through the ring gag. In one long thrust my entire mouth was filled with a latex wrapped penis. Between the stench of the man and the tip of his prick tickling my tonsils I came within a hairs breath of puking right then. 
Increasing speed with each thrust the man gave me a full skull fucking. My head was jerked violently back and forth as he bobbed my skull on each thrust. The stench of his body filled my nose but the sweet taste of cherries filled my mouth. I couldn&#8217;t believe the depths of my own ADD. I was getting face fucked in the middle of a road by a stranger and my mind was getting distracted by the taste of the flavored condom he was using. 
Taking stock of my body I realized I wasn&#8217;t just distracted by the taste of his latex covered prick. At first I couldn&#8217;t believe it but there was no denying the truth. My cock was just as hard as the one in my mouth. I was absolutely disgusted and humiliated by what was being forced into me yet in the perversity that was my mind I was somehow enjoying it. Even having taken the blue pills I couldn&#8217;t believe I was having a hard on. That part small part of my brain that was enjoying this was enough stimulation for the pills to do their trick and leave me as hard as a teenage boy in the playboy mansion.
His motion changed and my eyes grew wide knowing what that meant. Smooth thrusts changed to jerky convulsions. His dick thrust to the back of my throat and lingered. Withdrawing from my mouth I could see the tip of the condom was now full of milky liquid. Condom or no condom I felt retched having a man cum in my mouth and yet there was no hiding the fact my own cock was twitching. I closed my eyes in absolute disgust as the man slowly pulled the condom off his dick that still twitched at the slightest touch. I was sickened by what was happening in front of me just as much as I was mortified by my own reaction. I didn&#8217;t want to look any more fearing I might experience myself getting more enjoyment from this.
A cruel hand grabbed the ring on the top of the head harness and yanked my head backwards. I opened my eyes and stared up at man who had just fucked me. 
�Hey queer. The guy who paid me the five bucks said you&#8217;d love it if I gave you this. Said it was your chance to fulfill the role of your favorite theater character but I&#8217;m pretty sure he meant actor,� the man said as he stood over me. 
No, the first was right. Chris would have said character and there was only one story I&#8217;ve written that involved a theater. My eyes focused on the hand that was inches above my face. I was looking straight up and his filled condom was in his free hand, his hand was posed over my ring gagged mouth. Turning his hand over he poured the contents of the condom through the ring into my open mouth. Cum splattered across my tongue and tonsils. I really was experiencing the life I had put into words.
�What a fucking pervert,� the man said to me in disgust.
The stranger who had just face fucked me was pouring his cum into my open and was calling me the pervert. Truth be told I was a pervert but that wasn&#8217;t the point. He was the one doing this to me right now and he was the one calling me the pervert. Don&#8217;t ask me why but that just made it ten times more humiliating to hear. I wanted to cry when I realized I couldn&#8217;t spit the cum back out. I coughed as some of it trickled down my throat. Fighting my initial urge to hurl when the cum load landed in my mouth I forced myself to swallow it before I choked. 
�Jesus, you&#8217;re just a cum guzzling fag. No wonder you call yourself Colonel Cock Sucker,� the man said harshly. 
I could see his enjoyment in his eyes seeing me squirm at the sound of his words. Forcing my head back down with his hand I was left with only a view of his feet. I heard him stretching out the condom like a rubber band. As he grabbed the top of my head harness I realized what he was doing. Onto the D ring on the top of the harness he tied the end of the condom. Feeling the remnants of his load ooze out of the condom and into my hair let me know he had tied off the closed tip of it. 
�Stand up Colonel Cock Sucker,� the man ordered as he yanked me up by the waist chain.
�Now bend over so I can fuck your ass.�
I did as he told me. He walked around behind me. I heard the rip as a condom was torn off the string and the tear as it was opened. It wasn&#8217;t long after that I felt the tip of his cock pressing pressed between my butt cheeks. I tried to relax but my body was instinctively tightening up. While my body&#8217;s natural reaction was to clench my puckered ass even tighter in the hope of thwarting off the impeding attack I knew it would only make things worse. There was no preventing what he intended to do and with as lubed as my ass was there was no preventing him from entering me. Looking up the street I could see Chris was furiously beating himself off behind the camera. Seeing him reminded me just how badly I wished I could touch my own cock right now.
Without warning he thrust the full length of his cock into me. Long hard thrusts immediately followed suit. Mentally I tried to prepare for the wave of pain that was coming from such a brutal penetration. If I wasn&#8217;t gagged I would have been biting my lip clean off. Slowly I began to realize I was getting the ass fucking of a life time but it didn&#8217;t hurt. Even with a small penetration there is always a little pain in the beginning but even with the hard thrust my ass got started with I felt no pain. 
As bizarre as this sounds I found myself both relieved and disappointed that I hadn&#8217;t felt anything. Ever since I experimented with my first small butt plug I have loved anal play. As my taste for anal grew so did my toys. Despite the pain or possibly because of it I love to stuff myself with my largest toys. Right now I felt no pain but I also couldn&#8217;t really feel his penis either. The cold ooze running down my legs made me remember my lube enema had desensitizing medication in it. Each time he thrust the lube would ooze out of my loaded hole and run down my legs. It also ran between my legs. I felt my balls and penis start to go numb as some of the liquid found its way across those surfaces. Even numb I knew I wasn&#8217;t going to be losing this erection. I felt let down knowing I was going to get used for someone else&#8217;s pleasure and not get any of my own.
I was so caught up with being butt fucked and thinking about my disappointment over not feeling anything that I didn&#8217;t even notice a new sound. My brain was so preoccupied that the sound echoing down the road didn&#8217;t even register at first. I focused my mind away from the distraction of the man fucking my ass and focused my mind on the information my ears were feeding in. My eyes bulged and for the first time since I&#8217;ve been gagged I yelled. 
Clang, clang, clang, clang, clang, clang�
Each hard thrust rocked my hips. For the first time I noticed the sick feeling in my stomach from having my balls jerked ruthlessly. The heavy bell hanging from my balls danced wildly from the arrhythmic motion of my hips due to the sporadic thrusts of the man jamming his dick wildly in and out of my ass. The sound bounced off of walls and carried down the road. 
In the dim light I saw movement and it was headed in my direction. I may as well have just rang the dinner bell at the local mission. Hordes of homeless people poured out of every dark alley and from behind every dumpster. In my excitement I realized I had exaggerated slightly. Eight men came into the light. 
Looking down the road I prayed Chris had realized how out of control this had become. To my immense relief I saw him quickly packing up his camera and dive into his truck. I prayed that Chris driving up here would be enough to scare these men off but I also knew if things did get out of hand Chris always had his cell phone. For the first time in my entire life, while in bondage, I actually wanted the police to come. 
The brake lights came on and with the roar of his engine the truck jumped forward. Without hardly slowing he turned around the side of the building. With so many people around me I knew he must have decided it would be safest to rush off to get help. I just prayed I could hold out long enough for Chris to return.
The men formed a circle around me and watched as the first guy continued to pound my ass. Eight guys stood around me while another one sodomized me. My dick was dripping at this point. I prayed it was just the lube running off my dick and hoped that it wasn&#8217;t my own precum. Two more hard thrusts then he pulled out. Once again he had spent himself inside my body. This time he tied the full condom to the harness letting all his cum run through my hair. 
Everyone was looking down watching me. I was the only one looking up to see a flash from the roof of the adjacent one story building. Letting my eyes adjust I peered into the darkness. Another flash came from the same roof corner of the building but no one else was looking. Squinting my eyes I could just make out an outline of something on the roof. My eyes bulged. There were two something&#8217;s. To the right was the silhouette of a man. Beside him was a tripod, there was a red glow at the top of it. I wanted to cry. Chris hadn&#8217;t rushed to my rescue or run off to get help. He had hurried to reposition himself to get a better angle of the main event, my gang bang. My focus returned to the crowd. Two men approached me, both smelled equally as bad as the first. One went behind me and the other in front. Each pulled off a condom from their perspective ends. The one in front pulled my head down till I was bent at the waist with my face level to his waist and the condom wrapped erect cock protruding out from it.
�Let&#8217;s give him a good old fashioned spit roast,� the guy behind me shouted to the crowd.
In unison the two men penetrated me from in both ends. I was stuffed with cocks with more on the sidelines waiting to fill the first opening that came up. The two men continued to work in pair as they both thrust and withdrew in the same motion. Locked in my bondage I had no option but endure this double fucking along with anything else about to come. 




Chapter 5: View from the balcony

The master and the key holder of David&#8217;s bondage filmed the gang rape with no remorse as he watched from his high vantage. Dave was forced to endure unimaginably humiliating acts that until now he never thought possible to occur. Chris&#8217;s only thoughts were on what he was going to try next and the amount of time he had left to do it in. Glancing at his watch Chris smiled. It was Friday and it was only eleven in the evening. He still had Saturday, Sunday and Monday plus an hour left tonight to fuck with Dave. He made a solemn oath to himself. He promised that in 73 hours all David would think about is how afraid he was of just how incredibly inventive Chris&#8217;s mind really was. This was only going to be the beginning. 
Chris did take a brief second to refocus his mind away from the future and back onto the present. Adjusting the camera, Chris zoomed in for a close up on David. He started with the head harness and the two used condoms tied to it before moving on to record the bell swinging from David&#8217;s straining balls. He zoomed in even closer to see something that made him laugh. David really was sick. Even getting double fucked by a pair of homeless guys in the middle of the street, with a bunch of people watching, David was managing to get off on it. On the camera Chris could not only see the rock hard erection but also the precum that hung in a long string from the tip of Dave&#8217;s dick. Of course it could have been the lube oozing out his ass, between his legs and off the tip of his cock but Chris was certain it was precum. 
A new vow was quickly made. The next challenge would have to be drastically increased. Chris wasn&#8217;t going to rest till he was able to watch David endure nothing but unhappiness. Chris desperately wanted to prove he could come up with something that even Dave&#8217;s perverted mind couldn&#8217;t enjoy, no matter what the cost was. If Dave was getting off on this right now Chris knew he hadn&#8217;t even come close to reaching David&#8217;s limits let alone manage to exceed them. It was extremely likely that there was lube running off the tip of David&#8217;s dick right now but Chris&#8217;s mind was made up and he was positive it was Dave&#8217;s own cum.
The erect and dripping cock that Chris was staring at through the camera only added to fuel the burning fire of rage that was quickly consuming his mind. Once again Dave was slapping him in the face. Just like the way Dave had belittled him with the contract asking him to get help, now Dave was throwing the fact that Chris&#8217;s bondage challenge had failed right in his face. Instead of being embarrassed and degraded as he got gang raped like Chris had planned Dave was enjoying it.
�Just you wait Davie boy. I might have underestimated how perverted you are this time but it won&#8217;t happen again.� Chris&#8217;s voice vanished into the darkness. The only people close enough to hear were too preoccupied with the naked man they were fucking. Chris&#8217;s mind hit overdrive as he planned his revenge and plotted David&#8217;s next bondage challenge.
