Bara

This position is used for a variety of reasons, sometimes as punishment. On stomach, face down and turned to the left with wrists crossed behind back. Ankles are crossed, as well, as if for binding.� 
"Bara!" he snapped. I flung myself to my belly in the grass, putting my hands behind me, wrists crossed, and crossing my ankles, too. I lay there in confusion, in obedience. He went to pick up the binding fiber which had been removed from my ankles by Tupita, from my wrists, a bit before, by himself. I had been spared! He returned to crouch over me. Tightly then were my wrists and ankles tied. He knew well how to tie women. "Oh!" I said, my ankles were pulled up and fastened to my wrists. He then pulled me to my knees and I knelt helplessly, closely and perfectly bound, before him. " 
Dancer of Gor, pg. 415

Belly

Slave falls to the floor face down, forehead resting flat on the surface, arms at sides, legs widely spread, crawls to the Master on belly. 
"On your belly", I said. She backed off a bit , and went to her belly. Her hair was before her face, as she now on her belly before me looked up at me. "Now inch forward", I said, "remaining low on your belly, and when you reach my feet, once again, as before, lifting your head a little, tenderly and humbly, and beautifully, as though you were a slave , lick and kiss them. Good. Good. Now take my foot and place it gently on your head. Very good. Now place it again on the Mat, and kiss it again. Good. You may now belly back a little, humbly. I have not yet given you permission to rise of course."� 
Mercenaries of Gor, pg. 411 
Binding� 
Kajira crosses her wrists and ankles, waiting to be bound. From the Gorean word Lesha, which translates as "leash." In this position, the slave remains either standing or kneeling, depending upon the current position she is in. She turns and puts her back to her Master, her chin up, her head turned to the left so a leash may be attached to her collar, with her chin up and her back and shoulders straight. Her wrists are extended behind her, side by side, in a position to be locked into chained slave bracelets
�
Blanket
�
In this position the slave has to remain very still and quiet when a covering is thrown over her until the Master removes it
�
Bracelets

In this standard binding position the girl turns to face away from the Master, back and shoulders straight, wrists held at the small of the back for ease in attaching slave bracelets. 
"Bracelets," he snapped. She put her head in the air and placed her hands behind her back. 
Hunters of Gor, pg. 146
Capture position
�
The girl lies on her back with her knees raised, heels on the floor in a standard, supine capture position.
�
Coffle
�
The command is often given with multiple girls, who kneel, in order of first slave to last, closely, one behind the other. With the command "left wrist coffle" the left wrist is raised to be placed within the wrist rings. This might be followed by the order to stand and the order "lower chain" where the slaves lower their wrists. Thus the slaves are then in line, standing, coffled, ready to be moved or displayed
�
Collaring Position / Submission

"Then, to my astonishment, the daughter of the Ubar Marlenus, daughter of the Ubar of Ar, knelt before me, a simple warrior of Ko-ro-ba, and lowered her head, lifting and extending her arms, wrists crossed. It was... the submission of the captive female. Without raising her eyes from the ground, the daughter of the Ubar said in a clear, distinct voice: `I submit myself.' I was speechless for a moment, but then, remembering that harsh Gorean custom required me either to accept the submission or slay the captive, I took her wrists in my hands and said, `I accept your submission.'" 
Tarnsman of Gor, pgs. 93-94 
�
Common Gorean Usage Position (sex)
�
The slave falls to the floor upon all fours, and keeps her head straight, her eyes looking forward, with her buttocks thrust upward and her thighs widely spread in preparation for the sexual use of the Master.
�
Crawl
�
The slave gets down on all fours, palms flat on floor...ass in the air...forehead close but not touching the floor....crawls to just an inch from Master's feet.
�
~Arching her back to display herself well before Him, the slave slowly leans forward, placing her palms to the floor, her tush rising above her heels as she pulls herself forward from her kneel. her arm reaches forth, breaking through the cascade of ash-blonde hair that falls over one shoulder, her hips rolling sensually with the shifting of her weight as she brings her opposite knee forward. Extending her arms to Him, relieving the stretch in her legs by sliding them forward to tuck beneath her, she moves like a larl in heat until she is within easy grasp of His left hand.~ 

Eye Contact
�
There are times when a kajira's eyes should and should not� meet those of a master. See the examples below:
�
Gorean Bow
�
�The girl kneels in the nadu position and bends her body backwards, her head to the floor, she places her hands by her head palms down then pulls up into a back bend.
�
Hair

The girl stands and bows at the waist, letting her hair fall forward for display, to be seized or for any other purpose the Master might require. Another variant of this position sometime used is for the slave to stay in her previous position just bowing her head and letting her hair dangle before her for whatever use required. 
I held my left hand open, at my waist. She stiffened, and looked at me, angrily. I opened and closed my left hand once. I saw her training in Gorean customs had been thorough. But she never thought that such a gesture would be used to her. She came beside me, and a bit behind me, and, crouching, put her head down, deeply. I fastened my hand in her hair. She winced. Women are helpless in this position. 
Beasts of Gor, pg. 409 
Heel
�
The slave goes to Master and kneels in nadu behind and to his left... awaits further orders note: if Master is right handed go to his left , if left handed go to his right.
The command for hair is often a silent gesture in the books, but may be given verbally as well. a slave approaches the Free opposite their dominant side, kneeling or crouching to place the slave's bowed head within easy grasp. It may be used when a Free wishes to have a slave by their side, lead a slave, wipe His fingers or face with her hair, moved to another position, controlled, or have her slavery impressed upon her.
�
~Seeing the rapid opening and closing of His hand at His hip out of the corner of her eye, the slave quickly moves to Master's left side, rolling up on her toes and lowering her tush upon her heels as she melts into a crouch to obey His command. Bowing her head, she places the crown of her head where He gestured.~ 
�
High Harness
�
A position in which a leashed slave is commanded to do....to show off her collar and neck.
�
Karta 
�
Basically, this seems to be an online misnomer to a particular type of obeisance wherein the slave kneels with knees spread then bows forward until her forehead touches the ground, her palms down near her head.
�
�
Kneeling (Leash and other variations) 
The slave kneels quickly spreading her thighs wide, arches her back stiffly and places her hands, wrists crossed, at the small of her back, turns her head to the left with eyes lowered submissively, and lips parted slightly, she patiently awaits the leash, or inspection...(standing): The slave stands with feet shoulder-width apart, wrists crossed at the small of her back, head held high and turned to the left, lips slightly parted and eyes lowered submissively awaiting the leash or inspection.
Kneel to the Whip� 
�
Kajira kneels, head to the floor, arms crossed beneath her, back exposed in preparation to be beaten. In this position the slave first assumes the Nadu position, though with her arms crossed in front of her. She then leans forward and places her head to the floor, first sweeping her hair forward over her shoulders in order that her back might be utterly exposed to the whip.
�
Ko lar, or Collaring Position 
�
Also called "the Position of Female Submission." In this position the slave kneels at the Master's feet and leans her body back, sitting upon her heels, with her arms extended upward, crossed at the wrists, and her head beneath them lowered in supplication.
�
�
Lap
�
When the command "lap" is given, the slave girl has been ordered into the Master's lap. she does not necessarily sit, she may be draped over His legs with her body exposed for His caresses and viewing pleasure. 
To obey the command, the slave climbs upon or into the Master's lap. she may begin to kiss, caress, feed, or otherwise pleasure and tend to His needs, depending upon the wish of the Master. she may go to His lap with graceful and elegant motions, she may be brazen and forward, or she may leap into His arms. 
�
~The kajira purrs softly, stretching her arms forward and crawling to Him with the feline grace of a larl. Placing a tender hand upon His knee, she pulls herself up. Slowly, she then raises her knee and parts her thighs, trailing pointed toes delicately across the top of His lap. Settling herself upon Him, she draws herself closer to Him, wriggling her tush a bit for good measure. Placing her hand upon His chest, she arches her back and tosses her ash-blonde hair behind her shoulders, displaying herself well for Him before leaning in, her lips brushing against His ear as she whispers:~ Yes, Master.
Leading

The slave stands and moves behind her Master, slightly to His left or right side depending on which of His hands is dominant, bending at the waist. She places her hands behind her and puts the side of her head to her Master's hip, that he might lead her easily by the hair while walking.
�In a moment I had left the building, pulling the captive behind me, her head down at my waist, in leading position. 
Mercenaries of Gor, pg. 400 
�
Leasha

The slave kneels, thighs well parted, back straight or slightly arched, head held high, chin tilted to the left, hands at back with wrists crossed. This position is used to clip a leash onto the collar or for simple display/inspection of a slave girl. 
"Lesha," snapped the second officer to the blond girl. She spun from facing him, and lifted her chin, turning her head to the left, placing her wrists behind her, as though for snapping them into slave bracelets. 
Explorers of Gor, pg. 76 
Maintaining Position 
�
When a master places a girl in position, it is imperative that she does not break it until commanded to do so. 
�
�
Nadu
�

The slavegirl kneels with thighs spread wide, back held straight or arched slightly, breasts thrust forward, head held high with eyes lowered, sitting back on heels, hands resting palms up or palms down on thighs. Palms up was considered a plea for rape in some circumstances. 
"Come now, my pretty slaves"; said Ginger, "kneel straight, back straight, heads up. Back on your heel there! Spread those pretty knees. Yes, that is the way men like it. Put your hands, palms down, on your thighs,Good. Good. Excellent! The girls now knelt in the coffle as pleasure slaves.�
~Explorers of Gor, page 279~
Savages of Gor, pg. 155 
�
Nestle 
�
A command used by the Master when He wishes the slave to cuddle.
According to the book quote given below, the proper response to the command, "nestle", is for the girl to cuddle in the crook of the Master's arm. 
�
��You there, � I said, �crawl to my arms.� �Yes, Master,� she said. �Nestle� I told her.� �Yes, Master,� she said. She nestled obediently in the crook of my left arm."
Obesiance

There are three different forms of this position though all have the same basic meaning behind it. Each is a show of female submission. 
A) the slave kneels in nadu with her head lowered. 
B) from nadu, the slave lowers head to the ground, placing her hands against the ground, palms lowered. (this is sometimes referred to as "karta" on mIRC but is not referenced in the books) 
C) the slave moves to her belly and slowly inches forward to the Master's feet and at that point proceeds to lick and kiss at them before bellying back somewhat. (this position is known among many as the "belly" position)
"There are many ways to perform obeisance. "I said. "I am a free woman," she said, " I know none of them." "I shall instruct you briefly in three," I said. " First kneel before me, back on your heels, yes, with your knees wide, wider, your hands on your thighs, your back straight, your breasts out, good, your belly in, good, and now lower your head in deference, in submission." "Now that," I said, " may not be exactly a form of obeisance, for authorities do not all agree, but for our purposes we shall count it as one. It is, at any rate, a beautiful position, and it is, certainly, a common position of slave submission." "Now" I said, " and this is clearly a form of obeisance, bend forward and put your head to the mat, the palms of your hands on the mat. Good. Now lift your head little and come forward, substantially keeping the position. Forward a little more." "But then my face will be at your feet," she said," My lips will be over them!" "Yes," I said, "Good, now, put your head down and lick and kiss my feet." "I am a free Woman!" She Said. "You are a woman," I said," now softly lingeringly, and lovingly, Good." "I am not a slave," she said "All women are slaves, "I said " Imagine what this would be like if you were truly a collared slave." She gasped. "Now" I said, "for a third form of obeisance. You may belly to me." "I do not understand," she whispered. "There are various forms of bellying, " I said, and bellying may be suitably and pleasingly combined with other forms of floor movements, approaching the Master on all fours, turning to your sides and back, writhing before him, and so on. We will take a very simple variation, suitable for an ignorant free female who has not yet even begun to discover the depths of her sexuality." She looked up at me. "On your belly," I said. She backed off a bit , and went to her belly, her hair was before her face, as she now on her belly before me looked up at me. "Now inch forward," I said, " remaining low on your belly, and when you reach my feet, once again, as before, lifting your head a little, tenderly and humbly, and beautifully, as though you were a slave , lick and kiss them. Good. Good. Now take my foot and place it gently on your head. Very good. Now place it again on the Mat, and kiss it again. Good. You may now belly back a little, humbly. I have not yet given you permission to rise of course." 
Mercenaries of Gor, pgs. 409-410 
�
Prostrate
�
The slave kneels and touches her forehead to the floor, she stretches her arms out before her with palms face down and fingers spread.
�
Run

When this command is given, the slave runs toward her objective, taking short rapid steps with her legs almost straight, her feet barely leaving the floor. As she moves her back is straight, her head is turned up to the left, and her arms are at her sides, her palms facing outward at a 45 degree angle to her body. Upon approaching the object, she drops gracefully to her knees and typically resumes the position of Nadu.
"she had run as a slave girl is sometimes taught to run, with rapid short steps, her legs almost straight, her feet scarcely leaving the ground, back straight, head turned to the left, arms at her sides, palms out at a forty-five degree angle" (Assassin of Gor, page 45)
Slave lips

The slave turns toward person who commanded it, purse lips and remain immobile until freed from immobility with a kiss. 
Similarly, I was not required to respond to certain sorts of commands, for example, to make "slave lips," pursing my lips for kissing, or to writhe slowly before my viewers. 
Kajira of Gor, pg. 224 
�
She-Sleen

The slave moves to knees and elbows, hands clasped over your head, bottom in the air, ready for either being beaten on the bottom or being taken from behind like an animal. 
He knelt me there. "Put your head down, to the floor," he said. "Clasp your hands, firmly, behind the back of your neck." "Yes, Master," I moaned. He was then behind me. He put his hands, under my arms, on my breasts, sweetly and firmly. Then he moved his bands back, caressing my flanks. My head was down. My fingers were together, behind the back of my neck. I was in his collar. It was steel, I could not remove it. I belonged to him. My body hurt, from his whip, that of my master. My head hurt, from my hair, where I had been conducted, unceremoniously, to this location. "Please, Master," I sobbed. "Not like this! Not you, please!" "The slave is pretty," he remarked. "Oh!" I cried. "Oh!" "You have a lovely ass," he said. "Ohhh!" I said. "You may thank me," he said. 
Kajira of Gor, pg. 434 
�
Slaver's Kiss

Also known as the "kiss of the whip" or "whip caress". The slave moves to the floor on all fours, head lowered to the ground, bottom high in the air, thighs widely spread with slave's heat exposed. 
"Then, before I could realize what he intended, he had subjected Miss Cardwell to what, among slavers, is know as the Whip Caress. Ideally it is done, as Kamchak had, unexpectedly, taking the girl unawares.� Elizabeth suddenly cried out throwing her head to one side.� I observed to my amazement the sudden, involunary, uncontrollable response to the touch.� The Whip Caress is commonly used among Slavers to force a girl to betray herself." 
Nomads of Gor, pg. 168
�
Stand
In the books the command is "stand" or "stand as a slave." This is done according to the quote as back straight, head high, belly sucked in, breasts thrust out, hip slightly turned. In addition, one might add personal touches, such as placing one foot in front of the other, front knee bent, or pointing the toes. However that is merely personal preference, not given in the book. ~The girl curls her toes beneath her, moving her weight back over her heels and pushing herself to standing. Raising the crown of her head as high as she can, the slave lowers her eyes and presses her shoulders back as she sucks in her gut to display her figure well. Shifting her weight ever so slightly so that she may better turn her hip, she raises a delicate hand to tuck a stray lock of hair behind her ear, silver-blue eyes glancing quickly as a soft smile crosses her features, only to disappear as she drops her hand once again. Feeling her heart pound under the scrutiny of watchful eyes, she slightly turns her arms so that her soft palms face more forward
Sula

�
"Sula, Kajira!" said the man. She slid her legs from under her and lay on her back, her hands at her sides, palms up, legs open. 
Explorers of Gor, pg. 77 
�
Sula-Ki

"Alternative Sula": This position is almost identical to the Sula position, except once the slave has assumed the Sula position she slowly lifts her hips up off the floor, as if beckoning him with her body, encouraging her sexual use by him.� 
"She lay on her back, her knees drawn up, before me. She arched her back. Her breasts were lifted beautifully. I observed their lovely rise and fall, correlated with the respiratory cycle of her small lungs. Then she lay back, her shoulders in the dirt, and pressing against the earth with her small feet, piteously lifted before me, for my examination and seizure, if I pleased, the deep belly� of her, the sweet cradle of her slave's heat. 
Explorers of Gor, pg. 329 
�
Supine Capture Position 
Then she lay on her back, her knees drawn up, before me. She arched her back. Her breasts were lifted beautifully. I observed their lovely rise and fall, correlated with the respiratory cycle of her small lungs. Then she lay back, her shoulders in the dirt, and pressing against the earth with her small feet, piteously lifted before me, for my examination, and seizure, if I pleased, the deep belly of her, the sweet cradle of her slave's heat.
Table

�
This command is used when a Master is in need of a table to rest his drink or to just rest his feet. The slavegirl goes to all fours, locking her elbows, making her back smooth and level, holding her head level as well. (This position is not found in the books, but�online Masters seem to like it and often call a slave to this position.) 

�
Tower

"Oh," she said. The position of the tower slave, in most cities is very similar to that of the pleasure slave. The major difference is that the tower slave, whose duties are commonly, primarily, domestic, kneels with her knees in a closed position, whereas the pleasure slave, in a symbolic recognition of the fuller nature of her bondage, and its most significant aspects, kneels with them in an open position. The tower slave, of course, like any other slave, is fully at the disposal of the master, in any and every way. The distinction between the tower slave and the pleasure slave, though honored in some markets, some specializing in girls sold primarily for housekeeping purposes and others in girls sold primarily for the pleasures of men, is not really a hard and fast distinction; it is not absolute; indeed, it can even be transitory. A girl who is ordered to open her knees, or who finds them kicked apart, for example, realizes that she has now become a pleasure slave. 
Blood Brothers of Gor, pg. 107 
The Gorean male at ease, usually sits cross-legged and the female kneels, resting back on her heels.� The position of the Tower slave.. differs from that of a free woman only in the position of the wrists which are held before her and, when not occupied, crossed as thought for binding.� A free woman's wrists are never so placed. Priest-Kings of Gor, pg. 46 
�
Walk

When this command is given, the slave turns in a graceful pirouette, her hair swinging. She then walks, gliding across the room, her feet hardly seeming to leave the floor, her hips swaying sensually, her body erect and proud. When she reaches her objective she halts and stands, her body erect, her shoulders back, her chest thrust forward, her belly in. She turns her hip out a bit, her hands at her sides, and points one foot. Her head is up and her eyes are lowered.
"As Kamchak and I walked to his wagon, I saw several girls, here and there, clad Kajir; they were magnificent; they walked with the true brazen insolence of the slave girl, the wench who knows that she is owned, whom men have found beautiful enough, and exciting enough, to collar." (Nomads of Gor, chapter 5)
�
�
Whipping 
(assuming the modality of the she-quadruped)

The slave quickly drops to knees, and place forehead to the floor, hips raised high, cross arms across belly, fingers gripping your sides. 
I went to Targo, trembling, and knelt at his feet... I crossed my wrists beneath me and touched my head to the floor, exposing the bow of my back. It is the submissive posture of a slave girl who is to be punished. It is called Kneeling to the Whip." 
Captive of Gor, pg. 200 
�
�
~~Meaning of the Positioning of the Hands�~~ 
*Palms up or Palms down 
Palms upwards, or facing outwards, is indicative of submission, is a way of signaling a girls' need, helplessness, and desire to please. It is a silent signal of a girl's desire for her Master.

"Position!" I snapped. Swiftly she knelt again, as she had been commanded earlier. "You obey with the alacrity of a slave girl," I observed. "If I do not," she said, "I could be punished as one, could I not?" "Yes," I said, "and would be." I walked about her, examining her, She kept her back very straight, and her head up. I was then again before her. I noted that the palm of her hands, so soft, so vulnerable, had turned on her thighs, so that they faced up. Among slave girls this is a common ways of signaling need, helplessness, a desire to please.
Vagabonds of Gor, p 209
Fingers spread wide apart is further indication of both vulnerability and submission to the Master, and desire for him.
Priest-Kings of Gor, 234 

Palms downward is the most common position where the girl's hands will lay palms down on her thighs though in certain situations the girl's hands are turned upward, more inadvertently than by training. 

Come now, my pretty slaves, said Ginger, kneel straight. Back straight, heads up. Back on your heels there! Spread those pretty knees. Yes, that is the way men like it. Put your hands, palms down, on your thighs. Good. Good. Excellent! The girls now knelt in the coffle as pleasure slaves.
Savages of Gor, p 155
"
*************************************************************** 
~~Meaning of Eyes Downcast~~
Proper decorum and submission calls for the eyes to be downcaste unless the head is positioned to indicate otherwise, or the Master has commanded otherwise.
He suddenly snapped His fingers and, in the swift double gesture of a Gorean Master, pointed to a place on the dirt floor before Him, almost simultaneously turning His hand, spreading His first and index finger, pointing downwards. I fled to Him and knelt before Him, my knees in the dirt, in the position of the pleasure slave, my head down, trembling.
Captive of Gor, p 143
This is an online Gorean invention, in the books it is common for kajirae to gaze upon the Master's eyes unless the kajira is in trouble and seeking to demonstrate fully her submission.
Normally, eye contact between a Master and a slave is acceptable and common, but it can be denied or forbidden to the slave as a punishment or discipline.
Savages of Gor. pg 258
"Look up," he said, "Kneel straightly. Put your hands on your thighs. Head up. Split your knees. More widely, slut!"
Dancer of Gor, p 51

*************************************************************** 
~~Belly-crawling~~
Crawling on the belly is used for very specific reasons. The first of which is to placate a Master, if the Master is upset or the kajira has made a serious mistake. 
I pointed to the stones at my feet. Crawl I said, in Gorean. The girl slipped to her belly, and, as a slave girl, crawled to my feet. She put her lips to my foot; I felt her hair over it.
Tribesmen of, p 78
The second is to communicate need for the Master, the need to demonstrate submission and/or the need to communicate a sexual desire, depending on how it is done.
And last, crawling is used in the performance of certain forms of obeisance.
Other than that, do not crawl about. A Gorean kajira is supposed to be proud, believe it or not. The kajira should be proud of her skill and talent, her capacity� for love and devotion. Not of herself, but rather of the things she can bring to her Master, for her Master is her focus.

*************************************************************** 
~~Knee-crawling~~
Crawling on the knees is used for very specific reasons. 

I indicated a flat leather box to one side. "Knee crawl," I said. "Fetch it here."
She went to the box on her knees and picked it up, and returned to a place before me. It had been a simple knee crawl. I was briefly reminded, however, of the Turian knee walk, sometimes used by slave dancers. I considered the slave. I did not doubt but what she might be taught to dance.
Magicians of Gor, 20

*************************************************************** 
~~Entering a Room~~
The way to enter a room in a Gorean home varies from city to city depending on where hence a slave resides. 
Swiftly we assumed a common form of slave obeisance, kneeling, the palms of our hands on the ground, our heads to the ground. Many masters, though it tends to be rather associated usually with given cities, require this position of their girls, usually when they first enter his presence or find themselves, as in a room which he has entered, in his presence.
Dancer of Gor, p 114
At his entrance Susan put the palms of her hands on the floor and lowered her head to the tiles, assuming a position of slave obeisance common with her in the presence of her master.
Kajira of Gor, p 157
"Observe," once had said Elizabeth to me, to my amusement, in the secrecy of our compartment, "the twelfth way to enter a room."
I had observed. It was not bad. But I think I preferred the tenth, that with the girl's back against the side of the door, the palms of her hands on the jamb, her head up, lips slightly parted, eyes to the right, smoldering at just the right temperature.
"How many ways are there," I asked, sitting cross-legged in the center of the compartment, on the stone couch, "to enter a room?"
"It depends on the city," said Elizabeth. "In Ar we are the best; we have the most ways to enter a room. One hundred and four."
I whistled.
"What about," I asked, "just walking straight through?"
She looked at me. "Ah," said she, "one hundred and five!"
Assassin of Gor
*************************************************************** 
~~Feeding a Master~~
This is performed with the purpose of enticing and bringing the art of pleasing to the perfection that is the trademark of the trained pleasure slave.
"One thing of that sort I recall is a trick where the girl feeds the master a grape held between her teeth. She may or may not have her wrists braceleted behind her back for this particular feat. One leg is folded beneath her and the other is extended behind her, toes pointed, and then she lifts the grape delicately to your mouth. Elizabeth and I used to laugh heartily over this one, but I think it was effective, as I seldom got beyond the third grape."
Assassin of Gor
