&quot;To Be Satisfied...&quot;   
This was my secret life, out from beneath the eye of the mundane. This was
  a place of solace and a certain sadistic peace. I entered quietly through the
  door as I had been instructed. The surroundings - the slight creak of a worn
  door, the scents of daily living, did nothing to betray this meeting's true
  purpose. I made my way cautiously down the carpeted stairs, difficult to maneuver
  in the high stiletto heels that had been chosen for me. My mind began to churn
  thoughts of our last meeting and the secret pleasures it held. It had been
  a long week and I was looking forward to the evening's activities, a means
  of release.  
Opening the door to the basement, I was greeted with air a touch moist from
  the winter. I felt it upon the sheerness of my stockings and the bare skin
  I had exposed in numerous places. I had been told in exact detail how to attire
  myself &ndash; the top was a black leather corset, its elegant lines flattering
  my own natural curvature and clinging to my figure. I had marked with pleasure
  earlier the way my full breasts swelled, tempting above its low neckline. It
  had been explicitly put that I should wear little else - some stockings that
  stopped at the thigh, long vinyl gloves, a scant pair of panties, of course
  and the classical high-heeled shoes in a fine black velvet. There were a line
  of small silver buttons all down the back. I wondered if they would survive
  this encounter, probably not. Such were the insignificant things I took note
  of as I entered the room.  
The lights were dim and I was bathed in the subtle shadows of the intimate
  room. I discreetly shut the door behind me and stepped forward, my shoes making
  a light clicking sound on the floor. Having placed my things in the upstairs
  hallway there was nothing for my hands to clutch, so I fidgeted with my garters,
  making sure they were taut.  
Perhaps, if the situation had been a different one, I would not have noted
  his stealthy entrance, but I was trained to note such small things. With swift
  strides, He closed the distance between us. I could not help but cower a little
  in his presence. He stood before me, all power and confidence, his shadow cloaking
  my entire body&nbsp;in darkness. My stomach was tight with nerves and still
  I was drawn to him. Making a conscious effort not to sink into a kneeling position,
  I barely held back the flood of submission. It was too easy to surrender my
  dignity now. I mustered my courage, took a deep breath, and stood my unstable
  ground.  
His hand rose casually in a gesture calling me to him, until he dashed it
  across my face. I staggered before him, the taste of blood blooming on my lips. "You
  will kneel in my presence, whore," he said nonchalantly. I immediately sank
  before him, my heels tucked under my exposed bottom. The pain was slight and
  I maintained my position with pose. "Master&hellip;" The word escaped my lips,
  I no longer knew if it was a statement, a question or a plea. Perhaps it was
  all these things. The floor was cold and hard beneath me. I watched as he paced
  around me in balanced and calculated steps.  
"How do you dare show your face here? Is it to tempt my anger?" he asked,
  circling behind me. I felt his hand dig into my curls, wrenching my head backward,
  and I made an effort to keep my eyes downcast, despite the position of face.
  My throat felt vulnerable and exposed. "Look at me!" He pressed his firm thigh
  hard against the back of my head, sliding his hand down to encircle my throat,
  jerking my face towards him with painful precision. "Answer, slave."  
"Master&hellip;I did not know&hellip; I had displeased you," I managed to
  say flustered by both the pain and the pleasure of my situation. My breath
  seemed to come hot and laboured. "Is that so?" He punctuated his cool words
  with a jerk of his hand. "Well, I will have to teach you to make a better note
  of the desires of your Master." Another spasm of his clutching fingers and
  then release. My pulse beat in my throat and spots of black danced in my vision. "As
  you wish, Master&hellip;" I whispered the words as a fog of languor invaded
  my consciousness. With an effort, I turned my head, feeling the muscles of
  his thigh move beneath my cheek.  
"Prove it, then," he said, as his strong hand shoved me to the ground. "In
  the corner, now." His tone rang out strong and demanding, brushed with the
  faint hint of desire. I knew the corner well, equipped with rings and ropes
  for suspension. I had spent a great deal of time being punished there.  
Such was my fate, to desire the perverse. I could no more help my body's
  addiction to suffering than I could work to prevent it with my words.  
I crawled my way to the corner, the hard floor bruising my knees. I arrived
  in the familiar location and kneeled, obediently awaiting, my muscles tense
  with anticipation. I heard the too familiar sound of a drawer opening. Then
  a pause; its silence pregnant with the possibilities. I awaited his rough voice's
  issue. I was to be punished, that was clear, but how would he do it?  
My skin shivered as I knelt. My hands were resting on my thighs, which were
  growing steadily warmer with every passing moment. I knew better than to give
  voice to my body's urgings, he had taught me as much last time. I was still
  nursing those welts on my back. A slave's duty was to her Master and mine did
  not look well upon his property speaking out of turn. And so I remained, reveling
  in a beautiful agony until I heard his footfall stalking towards me.  
My head remained lowered, my eyes fixed on the hardwood below me. I noted
  its stained surface, small faded circles scattered in the corner. My blood
  no doubt. There had been times when he would strike me with force enough to
  draw my blood, but it was in those moments when I felt we had our most intimate
  connection - something primal, beyond words.  
I waited for the burning fire of pain to illuminate my body. I already began
  to crave the exacting delicacy of his work. If I took my punishment well, my
  Master would be pleased. He would reward my behavior. But no scourge fell,
  no exquisite pain coursed across my skin.  
&quot;On your feet,&quot; he said, grinding out the words. &quot;There,&quot; he
  added, pointing to a large wooden desk in the corner. I hadn't noticed when
  I entered, but the desk had been cleared of all of its contents. Once I was
  on my feet, he shoved me so that I stumbled, confused, towards the desk. &quot;I
  have waited long enough,&quot; my Master said menacingly, advancing toward
  me. &quot;Alright, slut. On your stomach.&quot; I leaned over the&nbsp;worn
  desk, its edge biting at my pelvis. Face pressed against the surface, the scents
  of polish and use filled my senses. I had assumed he was to paddle or spank
  me... I should have learned not to assume. I heard him moving behind me, the
  sound of a zipper, a belt being undone... I should have known. I felt his hands
  gently graze my buttocks, softly probing at the moisture already present. I
  felt him grab the nape of my top and tear it open, ripping the buttons all
  the way down my back. He spread my legs noting, I'm sure, how I was almost
  dripping with need.  
Then with one smooth thrust, he pierced me to the core. I could not help
  but cry out in surprise and fear. He was violating our contract. We had agreed
  that nothing sexual could come of our arrangement. He clutched my hips and
  thrust himself into my too narrow passage, so hard I gasped with pleasure. &quot;This...
  is what... you deserve, whore.&quot; I felt my body go pliant in his hands,
  submitting to the violation. &quot;You brought this upon yourself,&quot; he
  said coldly, as he grabbed a handful of my hair, pulling my head to far back.
  Crying out, my body began to lean into his force, massaging him inside me,
  with a will to please my Master despite myself.  
&quot;Admit it!&quot; Again he thrust into my depths, forcing his way even
  deeper by pulling me to him. Gasping with exhaustion and need I answered, &quot;Yes...
  Master...I did ...this.&quot; &quot;Did what...you filthy slut?&quot; &quot;I
  made you...I made you fuck me.&quot;  
As a gesture of approval, he stroked the aching pearl of flesh that lay pulsing
  between my lips, urging my hips to grind against the solid desk. All this proved
  too much for me and my entire body exploded in a flood of lust. While he continued
  to ram himself into me, sheathing himself to the hilt, I felt wave after wave
  of passionate languor. My body shook with the intensity of my climax forcing
  me to claw at the grain of the wooden furniture. I heard him groan as he climaxed,
  his muscles straining against my flesh. Then as deftly as he entered he pulled
  himself from me, leaving an aching hollow place.  
&quot;I want you to wear me...&quot; he said in a worn &amp; deep tone, only
  then did&nbsp;I feel his warm juices drip onto my back and rear. "Turn over,
  slave.&quot; I did so, painfully noting the trauma my hips had received from
  the desk. I kept my eyes downcast as he spent himself on my body, his juice
  dripping down my legs. He had marked me as his own.  
Gently he took hold of my chin, &quot;Look at me, I want to see your face,&quot; his
  voice full of subdued desire. I looked up at him, large hazel eyes searching
  his features. There I found contentment in his eyes and intent in his smile.  
&quot;What do you think I want you to do now?&quot; My mind raced through
  the possibilities and came to settle on only one answer. I knelt gracefully
  before him and took him into my mouth. I savoured him with every pass I made.
  He shuttered and let out a soft moan. I continued to work my tongue around
  his shaft, at times flicking its surface, at others licking it broad firm strokes.
  As his moans grew more frequent and intense, he grew to an erection in my mouth.
  I accepted him eagerly, lips and tongue working in artful precision, putting
  to practice years of experience. Elated, I devoured him with a renewed intent.
  I toyed with him as person dining on a rare delicacy, for indeed that is what
  he was. He buried his hands in my long hair, guiding my head along his hard
  form, but I needed no guide in this pleasure. I forced his slick shaft deep
  within my throat, cutting off even air for his pleasure. Once deep within my
  throat I made as if to swallow repeatedly. He shuttered with his whole body
  and shoved me to the floor, &quot;You fucking whore&hellip;&quot; he shouted,
  back-handing me across the mouth. I licked my lips, tasting my blood mixed
  with his seed. I looked up through the mass of&nbsp;curls spilling over my
  eyes and saw his face take on that familiar look of amused distain, as he again
  let himself spill all over my body.  
"Go clean yourself. I don't want a dirty slave." He motioned to the shower
  in the adjacent room. I rose obediently from the floor to cross to the room.
  He let me stand and make my way, watching my progress. Ever aware of his eyes
  following my exposed body, I carefully tread each step when a sudden fear overtook
  me. My heart pounding, I realized that he would not allow me to escape severe
  punishment if any of my filth was to drip on the clean floor. Now acutely aware
  of his wetness all over my skin, I strained not to let any fall. I reached
  the stall after what seemed an eternity. Letting go of the breath I hadn't
  know was held, I silently opened the beveled glass door. Reaching my hand into
  the shower, my flushed skin brushed the chill tiles. My body gave a slight
  involuntary shutter.  
Having turned on the fall of steaming water, I stepped gingerly into the
  stall, closing the door behind me. I let the steam enfold me and the warmth
  of the water seep into my bones, soothing the aches of my flesh. I tilted my
  head back to submerge my hair &ndash; letting it grow water-logged and silken
  down the length of my back, maintaining only a shadow of its former ringlets.  
"What makes you think a slave has the right to privacy?" he demanded, pulling
  open the door to the shower with&nbsp;his powerful form blocking the exit,
  allowing in a blast of frigid air and stealing my private revelry. Leaning
  forward, his heated fingers stroked my cheek allowing the sharpness of his
  nails to trail along my skin. My blood heated to his touch, my back arching
  forcing my breast towards his intimidating figure. With a faint smile he held
  my chin with his hand forcing me to look him in the face. With his other hand
  he held aloft a washcloth. "I want you clean. This should touch every inch
  of your body&hellip;slowly," he added with a mirthful smile. "And remember&hellip; I
  am watching." With that said, his hand forced the shower dial to the far left,
  turning the water from a delightful comfort to an icy torture. His smile twisted
  with a sadistic satisfaction as he took his seat in front of the shower, leaving
  the door open to view my suffering.  
Well, if it was a show he desired, I would not be the one to disappoint,
  despite the cold. Ignoring the frozen sheets falling on my shocked skin, I
  began to slowly caress my arms with the cloth. I made the conscious effort
  to frame myself in the door &ndash; a proscenium of sorts for my private stage.
  Years of dancing had allowed me full knowledge of how to accent a certain line
  or curve of the flesh and I used every lesson to please my Master. So slowly
  did I have the fabric grace me, every motion contributing to a silent seduction.
  I tried to push the frozen stream's pelting from my mind, but I felt my skin
  grow textured with small bumps and I had to clench my jaw shut to keep it from
  chattering.  
Still I continued on&hellip; massaging my legs; working from sculpted calves
  up over slender thighs to the one place that still held warmth. Suddenly the
  subtle texture of the cloth became intimately apparent. My eyes downcast, I
  chanced a secretive glance at my spectator, my full gaze falling upon the growing
  bulge straining within his trousers. A plan quickly budding, I turned my back
  to him under the pretense of washing it. I went to resume washing my legs,
  bending over, letting my hair cascade about my face, I used the dark and shining
  tendrils to hide my curious glance. Then, watching his expression, I slid my
  hand, covered in the terry between my legs. The cloth felt rough like a cat's
  tongue against my heated entrance, still swollen and aching from its earlier
  use.  
Since I could not use my voice to make my plea, I begged him for release
  using my body. I toyed with myself, imaging it was him touching me so gently.
  A fantasy of his caresses, so precise and poignant, guided me along. Chancing
  his displeasure, I let the cloth fall and continued my desperate performance
  with my own hands. Through my dark curtain of hair, I watched the lines of
  his face become pained with need. It was only fair that he should suffer somewhat
  for having violated me so&hellip;  
I withdrew my hand from its pulsing orifice and returned to just showering.
  Taking my hair in my hands, letting a few strands dangle artfully, I began
  my previous temptation anew. I sculpted my form, letting the graceful streams
  of water highlight my curvature. I slid my back against the smooth tile and
  guided the water to let a small trickle of its icy liquid trail over my breast,
  tumbling over my hardened nipple. Shifting my weight, I let one slender hip
  raise just so to emphasize a slender waist.  
I wanted him to take me in completely, to realize the full worth of his devoted
  pet. After all, I had worked to perfect my figure for him, countless hours
  of sweat and pain working towards an ideal.  
A hint of a smirk crossed my face as I realized that must appear as one of
  those erotic statues on an Indian temple. How appropriate then that I should
  be as a devadasi serving her god. With my spirits lifted and my body near hypothermic,
  I ended my performance. I looked at him repentantly, hands folded in front
  of me.  
 With just a nod, he silently released me from my arctic prison. I immediately
  shut off the horrible fall of cold and stepped from the shower. He stood, tall
  and utterly masculine, welcoming me into his strong arms; greeting me with
  the soft comfort of a rich towel. How I adored him in these moments of closeness.
  He held me willingly captive, against his broad chest, as he tenderly wiped
  all trace of moisture from my chilled skin. After I was dry he led me to a
  couch where he had several blankets already prepared. Wrapping me tightly he
  softly commanded me to sit and recover. Taking the place next to me, he sat
  with a single agile motion. I noted how it seemed his presence had lost none
  of its power, I still felt so small next to him, but now it felt as if he could
  shelter me with his will alone. The remainder of the evening was a haze of
  pleasant rewards and niceties. There had been some steaming cocoa, a massage
  returning life and heat back to stiff extremities and when I began slipping
  into a comfortable languor &ndash; a container of whipped cream to revive me.  
 An Anquissette's Journey  
This was my secret life, out from beneath the eye of the mundane. This was
  a place of solace and a certain sadistic peace. I entered quietly through the
  door as I had been instructed. The surroundings - the slight creak of a worn
  door, the scents of daily living, did nothing to betray this meeting's true

Opening the door to the basement, I was greeted with air a touch moist from

  myself &ndash; the top was a black leather corset, its elegant lines flattering
  my own natural curvature and clinging to my figure. I had marked with pleasure
  earlier the way my full breasts swelled, tempting above its low neckline. It
  had been explicitly put that I should wear little else - some stockings that
  stopped at the thigh, long vinyl gloves, a scant pair of panties, of course
  and the classical high-heeled shoes in a fine black velvet. There were a line
  of small silver buttons all down the back. I wondered if they would survive

  grow textured with small bumps and I had to clench my jaw shut to keep it from
  chattering.  
Still I continued on&hellip; massaging my legs; working from sculpted calves
  up over slender thighs to the one place that still held warmth. Suddenly the
  subtle texture of the cloth became intimately apparent. My eyes downcast, I
  chanced a secretive glance at my spectator, my full gaze falling upon the growing
  bulge straining within his trousers. A plan quickly budding, I turned my back
  to him under the pretense of washing it. I went to resume washing my legs,
  bending over, letting my hair cascade about my face, I used the dark and shining
  tendrils to hide my curious glance. Then, watching his expression, I slid my
  hand, covered in the terry between my legs. The cloth felt rough like a cat's
  tongue against my heated entrance, still swollen and aching from its earlier
  use.  
Since I could not use my voice to make my plea, I begged him for release
  using my body. I toyed with myself, imaging it was him touching me so gently.
  A fantasy of his caresses, so precise and poignant, guided me along. Chancing
  his displeasure, I let the cloth fall and continued my desperate performance
  with my own hands. Through my dark curtain of hair, I watched the lines of
  his face become pained with need. It was only fair that he should suffer somewhat
  for having violated me so&hellip;  
I withdrew my hand from its pulsing orifice and returned to just showering.
  Taking my hair in my hands, letting a few strands dangle artfully, I began
  my previous temptation anew. I sculpted my form, letting the graceful streams
  of water highlight my curvature. I slid my back against the smooth tile and
  guided the water to let a small trickle of its icy liquid trail over my breast,
  tumbling over my hardened nipple. Shifting my weight, I let one slender hip
  raise just so to emphasize a slender waist.  
I wanted him to take me in completely, to realize the full worth of his devoted
  pet. After all, I had worked to perfect my figure for him, countless hours
  of sweat and pain working towards an ideal.  
A hint of a smirk crossed my face as I realized that must appear as one of
  those erotic statues on an Indian temple. How appropriate then that I should
  be as a devadasi serving her god. With my spirits lifted and my body near hypothermic,
  I ended my performance. I looked at him repentantly, hands folded in front
  of me.  
 With just a nod, he silently released me from my arctic prison. I immediately
  shut off the horrible fall of cold and stepped from the shower. He stood, tall
  and utterly masculine, welcoming me into his strong arms; greeting me with
  the soft comfort of a rich towel. How I adored him in these moments of closeness.
  He held me willingly captive, against his broad chest, as he tenderly wiped
  all trace of moisture from my chilled skin. After I was dry he led me to a
  couch where he had several blankets already prepared. Wrapping me tightly he
  softly commanded me to sit and recover. Taking the place next to me, he sat
  with a single agile motion. I noted how it seemed his presence had lost none
  of its power, I still felt so small next to him, but now it felt as if he could
  shelter me with his will alone. The remainder of the evening was a haze of
  pleasant rewards and niceties. There had been some steaming cocoa, a massage
  returning life and heat back to stiff extremities and when I began slipping
  into a comfortable languor &ndash; a container of whipped cream to revive me.
