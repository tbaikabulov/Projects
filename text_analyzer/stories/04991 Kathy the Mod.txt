Synopsis:� Extreme and
detailed modification of my ex-fiance. Starting mild then morphing into nullification and other freakyness over a two year period.� 

&nbsp;

Introduction

This is a story of forced extreme female modification in a almost non-consensual relationship with an ex.� Most of the modification stories tend to be
the �when she awoke, she found that they/he/she did �. to
her�� This story goes into detail on not
only the what and why, but into the how portion. It goes without saying that do
not try this at home, for educational� and entertainment purposes only, the
author assumes no responsibility.� 

&nbsp;

Chapter One: Prelude to Infamy

&nbsp;

Part One: The Old Flame

&nbsp;

It all started to happen when she walked back into my
life.� The �She� was Katherine, my ex-fianc�.� A non-mutual agreement to break up occurred
about two years ago, basically the bitch left me.� Fast forward one year, I met then shortly
there after married Renee.� Time for a little aside about my wife. Renee is 4 foot 10
inches tall, weighing 96 pounds.� Her
hair is a light brown with natural blond highlights that comes down to her mid
back.� She maintains a finely toned
figure with exercise and the occasion diet when she thinks she is getting fat
(when the scale reaches 100 pounds)� Her
breasts are size A topped with quarter sized nipples, each pierced with 12 gauge
stainless steel capture rings.� She
maintains a neat and trimmed pubic area, just enough of the cleft hidden to add
to her allure.� For the numerically
minded, her measurements are 30A-22-30.

&nbsp;

Our relationship is (as the talk shows �experts� say) give
and take, we are both heavy sadists and light
masochists. Needle play, whips, knives, ropes, gags, electro stims and all
other assorted items come into our play with each other. The pitfalls of this
type of relationship is that as the doer we each want to take it up a notch
each time we play, but as a do-ee we both reach our limits before that
time.� To add to our frustration, both of
us maintain a very public lifestyle and cannot afford to be outed as perverts.
So, out of the blue Katherine comes to me with the sob story.� Now, the stage is set, the actors are ready,
if not willing, and the play of our lives is about to begin.

&nbsp;

�Katherine, my former
lover, 5 foot 6 inches, blond hair, blue eyes, tipping the scales at 128
pounds, 34C-30-34.� My pet nick name for
her was Lady Light, now whenever I think of her it is �That Bitch.�� Whoever said I was bitter.� I will spare the reader the details of her
life during her two year absence. The main points of that time included
marriage to a lawyer, isolation from her friends and family, then the lawyer
divorcing Katherine for no reason (besides his 22 year old male personal
assistant) and leaving Katherine without any money or assets.

&nbsp;

My first thought after opening the door (besides �What the
Fuck?�) was how in the hell did she find me?�
There seems to be this little thing called the �Internet� and that you
are able to look up people on it at public libraries, and this is how she
hunted me down over three different residences in two states.

&nbsp;

So, after a lot of her sobbing and, on my part, eye rolling,
she says that she wants to be a part of my life again �Just at that moment, in walks Renee and
suddenly there is a bit of tension in the house.� Renee and I make eye contact, then I
smile/smirk and lift my left index finger (during our �play� time, Renee and I
use this movement to convey �hold on a minute).�
Renee does an almost imperceptible nod then I introduce them to each
other.� �

&nbsp;

�Katherine,�� I said (I use to call her Kathy, but
to me that was an term of affection), �this is my wife, Renee.� Renee, this is Katherine, I might of told you about her once or twice.�

&nbsp;

Katherine�s expression exponentially surpassed the �deer in
the headlights� look that is so often talked about.� Renee looked, lifting her eyebrows, more
bemused than anything else.� 

&nbsp;

�Hello Katherine�

&nbsp;

Katherine stutters out �Uhh, hi.�� Then immediately looks down at the floor,
eyes welling with tears about to be shed.�
�I think I should get��

&nbsp;

I quickly interrupt her with �Hold on a minute, Katherine, Renee
and I need to talk a bit, we�ll be back in a few.�

&nbsp;

Upon exiting the room and closing the door I hear �What in
the hell is this?� from Renee, more in an astounded tone than an accusatory
one.� �She just� and you just� Okay John,
why are you smiling like that?�

&nbsp;

�Alright hon, here is the story� (again the reader is spared
the dull details) � and she showed up here today.�

&nbsp;

�So what are we going to do with her?� Surely not let her camp out here, I don�t
think I would be comfortable with that, no matter how much I trust you.�

&nbsp;

�No, she is not going to �just camp out� here, I have
something more in mind, along the lines of cruel and unusual� with that I bend
over to kiss her deeply, as our tongues fence each other, I tweak a nipple
through her blouse eliciting a surprised squeak from her.� �Let me call over to the Madagascar,
and get her a room for the night.� 

&nbsp;

Background � The Madagascar Hotel and Casino is a high end
establishment where, as a part time job, I train the various staff members in
emergency medical procedures.

&nbsp;

Further Background � Renee and I are both nurses, Renee
works in a operating room, while I work both as a
Flight Nurse and in a local Emergency Department.� Katherine, to add a little more spice later
on, is also a nurse (I originally met her in nursing school) but she was a
nurse on a medical ward, but she let her license expire while she was married,
hence no income.

&nbsp;

Two phone calls later (one to the Madagascar
and the other to a taxi company), Renee and I enter the room we vacated about
fifteen minutes ago, Katherine was still sitting where
we left her, a look of trepidation on her face.�


&nbsp;

�Katherine, it�s getting late and Renee and I need to talk
about this alone.� So here is the plan, I
got you a room at a local hotel and a cab will be here shortly to take you
there, do you have any money for the cab?... I thought
not, okay I�ll cover it.� If you are
hungry you can order room service or go to any of the shops in the hotel, just
tell them to put it on my tab, and if they have any concerns they can talk to
Mark.� Getting this?� Good, now then, where was I, oh yah, tomorrow
we�ll both meet you at �The Green Dorm Bar� at five and we�ll talk about this
further, I�ll cover the fare there also.�
Okay?

&nbsp;

Katherine numbly nods her head to the plan, just then there
is a horn sounding outside.

&nbsp;

�I�ll walk you out,� I said to Katherine.

&nbsp;

�Bye bye Kat,� Renee says.

&nbsp;

After escorting Katherine to the cab, I hand the driver two
twenties for the ten dollar cab ride telling him to keep the rest. I load
Katherine�s two suitcases in the trunk (they were still out on the foyer), and
whisper to Katherine �Don�t worry, I am sure we�ll
work something out.�� With that she
smiles and gets into the cab which shortly drives off.

&nbsp;

.My face transforms for the empathic concerned look to a
devil�s grin as I turn around to enter the house.� As I do so I adjust the erection I have been
sporting ever since I kissed Renee.

&nbsp;

Part Two:� The Plan

&nbsp;

�So, do you want to tell me what you are up to?�� Renee asks.

&nbsp;

�Just one moment,� I said as I head to the home office.� There I rummage around, until I find a binder
with the name �Kathy� stenciled in on the front.� Taking my prize, I head to the living room,
breaking the seal as I walk.� Once there,
I toss the binder and contents on the coffee table and tell Renee to have a
look.� After about ten minutes of
flipping through the papers, she looks up at me with the �AND???� expression on
her face.

&nbsp;

�So she is a submissive,� states Renee, �so what.�

&nbsp;

�No it�s not only that,� I explained, �it�s that she is
easily led, very insecure about herself, and is a mild masochist.� As my
evidence, I pull out a twenty page questionnaire and show it to Renee, the last
page has about a one page type conclusion written by myself.� 

&nbsp;

Background (Again) �� Since Renee already knows the history
of Katherine and me, allow me to educate the reader.� Katherine and I had, particularly in the
beginning a quite kinky relationship. During our second summer together, she
agreed to be my slave for a month, with various stipulations that I won�t go
into here. So in the beginning of her slavery, she answered and took multiple
psychological tests which I condensed into the questionnaire that Renee was now
looking through.� With the help of the
local medical library, I made my conclusions and �trained� her with those in
mind.� Unfortunately, at that time I was
in love with Katherine so her �slavery� was a light burden (if any at all) at
that time.� This time it would be
different.

&nbsp;

Back in the Present - �Look,� I said �we both have these fantasies
and ideas that we want to do, but don�t dare try them on each other.� We can�t go out and search for someone that
we can play with the way we want to due to our �Mrs. And Mr. Jones type of
life.��� But, right now, Katherine has
basically bared her throat to us, to use, to modify, to torture until we tire
of her.� After that, it will be up to her
to sort it out.�

&nbsp;

Looking interested, Renee says �So far I am with you, go
on.�

&nbsp;

�So this is how I got it figured, we hire Katherine as a
live in domestic, with her legally being a self contractor, this way she has to
provide for her own medical and dental expenses with the added bonus of use
being able to charge her room and board when she is living with us.� To �help� her out, we can get her the insurance
from our bank. So even with us taking out these �expenses� before we pay her,
her contract will also state that we will be holding her pay in escrow until
her contract time is up, I am thinking about two years should do it.�

&nbsp;

�Oh, I see.� She�ll be
totally dependant on us for those two years, after that who cares really.� So we�ll have a housemaid, and we can �play�
with her without her possibly calling the cops on us.�

&nbsp;

�It�ll all be in the contract,� I said, looking rather
smug.� �The contract I was thinking of
will be a combination of a domestic servant, with a detailed and strict dress
code, her punishments being broadly defined, and with an amendment which will
be an informed consent for medical experimentation.� With that, she�ll be ours.� Legally, she will be our slave, wearing or
not wearing what we want, that we can torture as we please.

&nbsp;

Renee, playing devil�s advocate, says �Will all of that hold
up in court?� 

&nbsp;

�Chances are no, but she�ll be screwed too if she were to
try, for signing an illegal contract, which she would need to prove to charge
us with anything, would make her an accomplice to her own torture, meaning that
the contract would be null and void with either party owing nothing to each
other.� We would get to keep the money,
and she would still be broke and have the mods we did to her still present.�

&nbsp;

�Hm, sounds pretty good, I�ll trust you on this, but you get
to do all the legal paperwork, that stuff gives me a headache.�� Renee adds, with her hands slowly running up
my body, �So, what should we do to her then.�

&nbsp;

Smiling, I take both of her hands into mine and started
tugging her towards that bedroom, �Let�s discuss this in a more comfortable
atmosphere, shall we.�

&nbsp;

Renee laughs, takes her hands out of mine and begins to
strip, I follow her lead.

&nbsp;

Part Three � Sex Talk

&nbsp;

Once we are both naked, I tackle Renee into the bed, she
resists laughingly.� Gripping both her
wrists into my left hand, I straddle her hips, and pin her arms above her head.� She struggles a bit, noticing how her
movements are exciting me. Precum forms on the tip of my cock, as I roughly
hump her outer labia, my frenium piercing rubbing her clit with each
stroke.� Her struggles become more focused, meaning she basically gave up and started to gyrate
her hips to the rhythm of my thrusts.� Watching
her closely, her face becomes flush, upper chest reddening, breathing deep but
irregular.� As I feel her ass cheeks
start to tense and tremble, I stop my thrusting, lifting myself off her hips.� With one exacerbated breath, Renee opens her
eyes, looks straight into mine and says �You mother fucker, I was sooo close.�

&nbsp;

Glancing down between her legs, seeing the wet sheets under
her, I wink and say sweetly �I know.�

&nbsp;

�So,� I said, acting like we both weren�t both terribly
aroused and naked, �what do we want to do with our very own slave girl?� 

&nbsp;

This made Renee think for a bit, �I think we should start
off slowly, you know, basic household slave training, like that Miss Abercrombie
writes about, toss in a couple of piercings, add a tattoo, then get serious.�

&nbsp;

�Sounds smart to me, don�t want to scare her off before��
Then I go into a fake maniacal laughter. �So after that� what about her
breasts,� I bend down and suck on one of her pierced nipples, biting down a bit
and tugging hard.� This elicited the
response I wanted. I look up at her and, with my voice being a bit muffled due
to the nipple in my mouth say �So?�

&nbsp;

Renee�s hand grabs my hair and pulls me over to the other
nipple as she says �How about implants, embarrassingly big ones.�� Renee, I know has a bit of a Napoleon complex
in regards to tits. As I suck harder, Renee continues �I want her nipples
stretched out too, over an inch, then �� �she breaks off, I look up and I just
see a evil smile on her lips.

&nbsp;

With my attention on her nipples and not holding her wrists
tight, Renee twists out of my hold, hugs me, then
flips me to my back.� �I�ll tell you what
John,� she says �I get domain over her tits,� with that she reaches down a
forcefully twists both of my nipples.�
Gasping, I nod my head. �And,� she continues �you can do what you want
down there.� As motion follows thought, her hand glides down my stomach and to
her pussy, spreading her nether lips, she begins to stroke herself to orgasm,
finishing what I started.� �But,� she
says almost as an after thought, �you can�t fuck her there.�� With that statement, she
roles off of me, turns her back towards me and says �Good night.�

&nbsp;

Some people may call it power exchange, others teasing or
foreplay, I call it frustratingly fun. With my left arm I place it over her head, and my six foot frame spoons her smaller one.� She wiggles comfortably back into me, and my
left arm slips into the crook of her neck.�
As I feel Renee relax, I lovingly whisper �Good night, Love.�

&nbsp;

With that, my left arm wraps itself around her chest, my
middle and index finger capture her right nipple and pull it upward.� With my right knee, I pry her legs apart, and
my right hand goes to her cunt, roughly pushing my fingers into her still
dripping wet hole. Renee gasps and starts to struggle in my embrace. Taking my
right hand from her cunt, I whisper in her ear in the same tone, �But I will
fuck her here.�� With that my middle
finger, lubed by her own juices is pushed into her ass. I begin to stroke my
cock between the cleft of her cunt lips, slightly lubing
up.� Renee squirms, repeating softly �No,
No, No.�� 

&nbsp;

Using her right nipple as a leash, I pull her chest down so
that it lays on the mattress.� Curling up my right middle finger, I pull� Renee�s ass into
the air. Taking my now, slightly lubed cock, I slowly push into her anus after
removing my finger.� Using small stokes,
I gradually go deeper and deeper into her rectum, until my balls are resting at
her pussy.� Always the gentleman, I
whisper �Hard or soft?�

&nbsp;

I think she said hard, being that her head was in the
pillow, it wasn�t real clear what she said.�
So I pull my cock almost all the way out of her ass and roughly slam it
in.� The amazing thing about the rectum
is that it acts like a sponge, sucking up any moisture in that vault, so the
more and longer I ass fucked the less natural lube was helping out.� I didn�t mind, but Renee was
seeming to take exception to it. Pushing and grinding into her, I near
orgasm, taking my right arm, I crossed it over my left, grabbing Renee�s left
nipple. The closer I came to cumming, the harder I pulled, until I finally
came, twisting both of her nipples cruelly. Sighing, I pushed her hips down
into the mattress with my cock still inside and rolled both of use to our sides
in the spooning position.� Her breathing
was still a little ragged when I lovingly whispered �Good night.�

&nbsp;

Part Four � The Proposal �

� 

Waking up early at around 10:00AM
(When you�ve been working night shift for eight years 10 o�clock IS early) I find that I am alone in bed.� Sniffing the air, I smell rich coffee
brewing, I jump out of bed (read: stumble) and make my way to the kitchen after
putting on a robe.� I mumble �Morning�
too her as I get myself a cup of java.

&nbsp;

�You bastard,� was the greeting I received, shortly followed
by: �thanks to you I won�t be able to sit down for most of the day.�

&nbsp;

�Why is that?� I ask innocently.

&nbsp;

Blushing a bit she says �you know
why.�� For some odd reason, Renee blushes
really easily in the morning, an endearing trait.

&nbsp;

All she got out of me was puppy dog eyes and a �Hmmmm?�

&nbsp;

�Like I said �Bastard,�� after slowly shaking her head, she becomes
serious saying �Okay, what do we need to get done today for our guest?�

&nbsp;

After a swig of life blood and taking a deep breath I start
�The main thing would be the contract with it�s
inherent legalese.� I should be able to
take care of that, other than that, we need to work out a plan of attack for
the next week.�

&nbsp;

The next hour was spent with Renee and I
hashing out a schedule for the next week over coffee and bagels.� The one minor problem was what to do with
Katherine while the both of us were at work, we
decided that she would stay at the hotel on those nights until we got both
Katherine and a special place prepared.� Renee
stood through it all.

&nbsp;

Renee and I own a former auto shop in central Las
  Vegas that we converted over to a very livable
home.� At first, Renee thought I was
crazy, but as the work was being done, she fell in love with the place.� The old office and waiting area was converted
into the living room, foyer, and in the back facing a barren yard was our
kitchen.� The four door garage bay on the
left of the building we kept basically as is and use
it as, get this, a garage.� The six bay garage to the right of the office was made into our bedroom
and lounge area.� The last bay we turned
into our �Recreation� room.� The outside
still looks like crap, but only so much could be done in the eight months of us
owning it.� The only other interesting
information about our place is, given that this is not a �nice� area to live I
made a very intense and illegal security system for our domicile.

&nbsp;

After a nice long shower, I feel alive enough to start
calling in some favors.� My first call
was long distance to Pahrump to talk to Steve.�
This gentleman owns a quite prosperous and unique brothel in that small
town.� His ladies cater to the darker
side of love, and being such he is the perfect source of information of the
legalities of having your employees beaten.�
Now, how is it that I know Steve, in actuality I know most of the
brothel owners and prostitutes that are around the vicinity of Las
  Vegas.� In Nevada,
the law is that each legal prostitute must get a monthly exam and weekly lab
draws for various STDs.� The brothel owners
tend to get together and contract out this job, and yours truly has had the
contract for the past year.� With Steve,
I have a further understanding, if a john gets a bit over enthusiastic and
causes some damage to a girl at his place, either
Renee or myself drive out there and perform an exam.� If it is nothing serious, then all is well,
if there is something serious, between Renee and I we have enough contacts in
the medical community to have the girl seen and treated discretely.� This little relationship saves Steve a
fortune in workman�s compensation insurance, so he owes me a few favors.� I called one in to get him to fax over his
various types of contracts he uses with the prostitutes, he also contacted his
lawyer to draw up the contract for Katherine pro bono.

&nbsp;

My next phone call was to my hospital�s legal office and
asked for Martina.� Her
and I worked together on an informed consent that is required for patients
undergoing risky procedures, so that if they either die or become seriously
harmed, then no one could successfully sue the hospital.� After some small talk, I asked her to e-mail
me informed consents performed by non-physicians.� There is such a thing, for instance, if as
part of a clinical trial, a lab technician that is to draw Jane Doe�s blood, accidentally hits an artery, causing a vessel spasm,
blood stops flowing to the lower arm, it turns necrotic and falls off, the lab
technician would be basically covered.�
That is a risk of getting blood drawn, now most
hospitals do not do this since all procedures are in some way overseen by a
physician.� But, some independent
entities do have these consents, and it was this type that I was after.� Martina really did not question me much
before e-mailing a generic consent, since she knew I had a lot of odd jobs in
the community.� 

&nbsp;

One finally call to Steve�s lawyer to talk about what I want
included in the contract, leaving out the modifications that would be included
in the informed consent, and my job was done.�
With that, I showed a copy to Renee, who just smiled.� Time enough to go and eat
at a sushi bar then head over to the Green Dorm for a meeting with our future
employee.

&nbsp;

The Green Dorm, for the uninitiated is a unique
establishment.� It is dark and seedy with
a dangerous atmosphere.� Upon entering,
patrons either feel an evil glee or a fearful shudder depending on their
dispositions. As I loiter around the front of the place, Renee heads to the
back to get us a nice a secluded booth for the negotiations that is about to
commence.� At 4:45 Katherine arrives, I nod to her as point out Renee,
indicating that Katherine should go over to her.� I go outside and pay the taxi driver 40
dollars and wish him a good evening.

&nbsp;

Body language is an interesting phenomenon,
the scene in front of me is Renee and Katherine sitting at polar opposite ends
of the booth.� Katherine with her head
bowed, her fingers fidgeting with the hem of her khaki shorts, looks ready to
jump at the slightest noise.� Renee was
at her leisure, leaning back, about a fourth of her beer finished, looking at
Katherine as one would look upon a somewhat interesting item in a store. Not
ownership, at least not yet.� ��

&nbsp;

Making some noise as I approach the table, I sit down next
to Renee, put my arm around her shoulder and give her a slight squeeze. �So,
shall we begin?�

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Part Five � The Signing

&nbsp;

�Are you ready to hear me out Katherine?� Good, to start with I don�t love you anymore,
nor is there a chance that I would leave Renee.� A pause starts after that
statement, lengthens, until Katherine looks up, opens her mouth to say
something. Then I continue, �But, you are still attractive, to both myself and Renee.�� 

&nbsp;

Renee�s turn, �Kat, you know that John is a rather kinky
guy, I know what you two did while you were together.� A
start from Katherine. �Well, you see Kat, me and him are both alike in
that respect, too alike in some areas.�
So, what we are offering is something similar to this.�� With that Renee pulls out the Kathy binder
and takes out the old contract and tosses it across the table. Another start from Katherine as she picks up the papers.

&nbsp;

�So you both want me to be your submissive?�

&nbsp;

�Close Katherine, this is what we had in mind.�� With that I pull out the new contract from
the �Kathy� binder and lay it down in front of her. 

&nbsp;

Upon further reflection, the old contract between Katherine
and I was like a teenager�s love sick poem to his first lust.� All sweetness and niceties with all the real
control in the, and I use the term loosely, slave�s hand.� The new contract, three times as long, was
written more as an owner�s manual, very dry, with no emotion in it, and as
Katherine will find out, giving her no say what so ever in her life.� 

&nbsp;

�We�ll leave you alone and let you read through this, we�ll
be over by the bar.�� With that Renee and
I leave the both.� The bar is situated so
that sitting down at it, the mirror behind the bar
shows our booth and Katherine perfectly.

&nbsp;

�So, do you think your ex will fall for it?�

&nbsp;

�Don�t know, even if she doesn�t, this entire situation has
made me randier than hell.�

&nbsp;

�No, shit I know what you mean, I am dripping wet.�

&nbsp;

Taking that as an invitation, I lower my hand and feel
inside Renee�s pants, quickly finding her clit, I begin to gently rub it (it�s
that type of bar).� Multi-tasking, I keep
an eye on Katherine, teasingly keeping Renee just this side of
�orgasm, and enjoying my single
malt that I ordered.� After fifteen
minutes, the single malt is gone, Renee is grasping my wrist with both hands,
and Katherine just finished reading the contract and is tidying up the papers.

&nbsp;

�Let�s head back� I say as I remove my hand from Renee�s
crotch against her silent protests.

&nbsp;

�So, what do you think?� I ask Katherine, as I lightly brush
her cheek with my cum covered finger.� Katherine either didn�t notice the slickness,
or chose to ignore/deny what I did.

&nbsp;

Katherine square her shoulders, and
took in a deep breath.� Good, I thought,
she�s going to try to play hard ball, it wouldn�t be
any fun if she just caved in.

&nbsp;

Rather forcefully, Katherine says �You two want me to be
your scantily clad housekeeper that you get to tie up and whip, right?� I want to know how hard and if my limits
would be respected, if I say stop, you would, wouldn�t you?�

&nbsp;

�Well Katherine, no.� As described, if whipping or another type of
negative reinforcement activity was being done as punishment, how would you
truly be punished if you could say �Stop� at anytime.� If on the other hand, the whipping was for
your erotic pleasure,� I said, knowing full well that that situation would
never happen �Then, yes, we would respect your limits.�� �

&nbsp;

Katherine nods her head almost in perceivably and asks �And
what is this informed consent for?�� 

&nbsp;

Renee chimed in �Well Kat, if, let�s
say we pierce your nipples, that is what this consent is for, since neither
John nor myself are docs, the consent covers any risks involved in the
�procedure.�� With that Renee made the finger quote signs when she said
procedure.� 

&nbsp;

�But what if I don�t want my nipples
pierced, or any other modification.�

&nbsp;

�Katherine, the contract states what actions you can take if
you don�t want something done,� I said, knowing full well that the complicated
jargon basically states that she would loose all money owed to her, and she
would be fined 85% of the remainder of the contract, and if she could not
present us with the said amount within 24 hours, she would be forced to do
whatever procedure we wanted.� What
elevates this from a �damn, that�s harsh� to a purely evil situation is that:
A- Katherine is broke, spent the last of her money to get to my house; B- Her
only source of income is what we pay her; C- the loss of money that is held in escrow
occurs before she is required to pay the 85%; and finally D �per the contract,
Katherine is required to pay back the money so far spent on her since her
arrival at my doorstep.� So even in the
last minute of the contract, she could still not pay us the ten cents that the
contract stipulates.

&nbsp;

From the look in her eyes, Katherine did not understand the
consequences, �Besides, I added, the contract says that no (here is where I do
my finger quotes) �modification� shall be noticeable while wearing conventional
clothing.� This seemed to relax Katherine further,
little did she realize that �conventional,� as defined by the contract, meant
Victorian era clothing, limiting Renee and myself only so far that we could not
pierce or tattoo her face nor completely shave her head.� I figured we could operate within those
stringent limitations.� 

&nbsp;

Renee�s turn at being good cop, �Listen, Kat, we really want
to work with you on this�How about we increase you pay by ten percent and also
decrease the costs of your room and board by twenty percent.� Would that make it better for you?�

&nbsp;

In the contract given to Katherine, all the numbers are
penciled in.� The penciled in room and
board were already 20% above the maximum allowable by law, and her annual pay,
with the increase of 10% would just cover the various taxes and legal fees
built into the contract, if she didn�t default.�


&nbsp;

Somewhat numbly and a bit overwhelmed looking, Katherine
nods her head.� Renee made the
alterations to the contract in pen after erasing the penciled in numbers.

&nbsp;

�So ready to sign?� I ask.

&nbsp;

Katherine says �Sssuurree.�

&nbsp;

�John,� Renee says, �Let�s go somewhere different for the
signing, shall we?�

&nbsp;

�Why not, I know the perfect place.�� As I pay for our drinks, Renee stands up and
offers her arm to Katherine, which she takes.�
Exiting the bar, we get into my car, Renee and myself
in front, Katherine in back.� We are soon
heading East to a large park off the Strip.� We exit the vehicle, it is a beautiful Fall evening, and I find bench with a nice view of the
park.� The only thing marring the scenery
is a multitude of homeless populating the periphery of the park.� As Renee and Katherine sit down on the bench,
I amble over to two of the homeless men and ask if they could help us out for a
minute.� They agree readily as I produce
a fifty for each of them.� The last page
of the contact has an area for five signatures, Katherine�s, mine, Renee�s, and
for two witnesses.� I explain to our down
and out witnesses that they just need to see Katherine, myself, and Renee sign
the paper, then they sign where indicated.�
The signing was rather anti-climatic. But then a thought entered my
mind: I just got unlimited access to torture, mutilated and degrade Katherine
for the next two years.� And she just
signed her life away, witnessed by two bums.
