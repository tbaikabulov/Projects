Synopsis: 






Kitty stretched as she awoke, the rays of morning sun fell across her face, its strength warming her body in readiness for the day ahead.

She lay on the hard floor reliving last nights experience, thinking of the tall stranger who had silently commanded her obedience, who had used her for his pleasures, whom she had willingly attended to partly out of a need for human company, party out of a need for physical release, but mainly because her need for subservience had been left unattended too for such a long time.

She ventured out onto the rocks and found a deep pool in which she could bath, recognising that she was still required to cover herself in public she entered the pool still shrouded in her silk and lace gown, as she entered the water the gown clung to her body showing the fullness of her breasts, her nipped in waist, her slender stomach. As she lowered herself, she began to lift the gown over her head, ensuring that the gown rose no higher, than the level of the water, the requirements of all women fulfilled. The coolness of the water made her nipples erect, hardened and taught they pulled the skin of her breasts lifting the whole of her bossom into a rounder more attractive shape.

She bathed quickly and efficiently, then swam for a while, enjoying the coolness of the water on her skin. As she relaxed in the water, she became aware of someone watching her, she scanned the area quickly to see who it was, and smiled as she recognised the outline of Hen, the man who had used her for his pleasure just the night before. 

To her complete surprise, he walked boldly into the pool, she reached for her robe, women were supposed to vacate bathing areas in favour of men. As she reached out, he grasped her hand, preventing her from leaving the water, also preventing her from dressing. She looked at him quizzically.&nbsp; He looked deep into her eyes, moving his hand from hers onto her wrist, he clasps the other wrist as well and pressed her hands into the water by her side.&nbsp; He leant forward and kissed her, his tongue invading her mouth, exploring, teasing, feeling its way between her lips and pulling back out again, secretly reminding both of them of the way his cock had invaded her mouth just the night before. 

Feeling her body relax, and realising she wouldn&#8217;t resist, he released the grip he had on her wrists, one arm wrapped itself around her waist and pulled her naked form onto his clothed body, she felt his body against his, and offered no fight, moulding herself to him as he pulled her closer.&nbsp; 

He bent his head a little and sucked her taught bud of a nipple into his mouth, warming it with his breath, it turned from erect through cold, through some subtle body changes to erect through excitement. He released that nipple and offered the same attention to the other one. Sucking and licking it, teasing it to a true erection until he was pleased with his work. 

She gasped, her body melting at his attention, but she was confused. Woman was there for the pleasure of man, to please man, to obey man. Yet here he was pleasing her? She didn&#8217;t understand, it felt so right, yet so wrong. 

He released her nipples, and looked hard into her eyes, then looked down towards his member. He brought his eyes slowly back up to meet hers.
His manhood was under water, and not in an excited state. She really didn&#8217;t understand, she knew the instruction, but had never been commanded to do it under these circumstances. Her hesitation was apparent, he clasped his hand into her hair and gently pulled her down, re-enforcing the unspoken instruction.



She held her breath and dipped beneath the surface of the water, took his manhood between her lips and sucked his flaccid penis into her mouth. She sucked tenderly, teasing his cock into action, as she ran out of air she surfaced, and drew breath.

He smiled as she rose up towards him, and tweaked her nipple between his finger and thumb as reward for her efforts, then repeated his instruction, he looked deep into her eyes, then down to his manhood, then slowly looked into her eyes again.

She submerged herself once more and sought out his cock, drawing it once more into her mouth and teasing it with her tongue whilst keeping her lips tight around it as if protecting it from the coolness of the water. She managed longer this time before she surfaced and was once more rewarded with a firm tweak of her nipples.

She remembered the pain he had inflicted the previous night, and the pleasure it had created. She remembered the turmoil her body had gone through, the intense pleasure that had accompanied the intense pain. She watched for his instruction, wanting nothing more than to please him in order to receive the reward.

He pinched her nipple harder, smiling as she winced then sighed as the pain turned to a burning need deep in her stomach, Turning his attention to the other nipple, pinching that one equally hard.&nbsp; He alternated between her nipples he continued to apply varying amounts of pressure, pleasure and pain with his fingers and tongue. Then finally the request came� he looked into her eyes, looked to his manhood, then returned his look to her eyes again.

She was down like a shot, under the water almost before he had finished his instruction, assuming that the more she pleased him, the more of his attention she would receive in return. She parted her lips and drew him in, this time sliding her lips along the length of his now erect penis, and pulling back to the tip before sliding back down again. Just as she was running out of air, she felt his hand on the top of her head, she felt a little pressure holding her down there, she sucked once more length and back as he held her beneath the water just a fraction past her comfort zone, then released her so she could surface and take on air.

She gasped with surprise as she refilled her lungs, his cock had engorged as he held her beneath the surface, she was relieved that her mild struggling hadn&#8217;t annoyed him, in fact it had the complete opposite effect, his decision to hold her beneath the surface for those few seconds longer than she would have wanted had turned him on immensely. She found herself increasingly excited by his actions. 

He looked at her, admiringly, none of the other women he had done that too had accepted it so freely. Most had become difficult, too difficult, sulky and uncooperative. This girl seemed reluctant, but willing. A contradiction in terms he mused as he tried to decipher the facial expressions, idling twisting her nipples between his fingers as her face contorted between intense pain and incredible pleasure.&nbsp; She loved it, but she hated it. This girl was willingly reluctant. She wanted to please him and was happy to accept things she didn&#8217;t want to accept, in order that she might achieve this.

He placed his hand on the top of her head and guided her beneath the surface of the water once more. As he felt her lips encompass his now extremely stiff manhood he held his breath, and held her there until he felt his own breath running out. He could feel her resistance beneath the water, not panicked, not scared, but definitely running out of air. She was still sucking gamely on him, increasing the speed and depth of her administrations. 

He released the pressure on her head and swiftly helped her back to the surface of the pool. The excitement it caused within him, the pleasure he got from restricting her in this way was immense. He had never found a woman so alluring, so willing to please, so accepting of things she didn&#8217;t want in order just to please a man.&nbsp; He wanted her, his balls ached with need as he took her by the hand and lead her naked from the pool. As they left the water she tried to cover herself, to hide her intimate parts from the outside world. He laughed at her, at her attempts to maintain the rules laid down by generations before. He liked her being exposed, he loved that he could make her break those rules. It thrilled him to the core.

As they reached the rocks, he found a suitable place, and instructed her to lay herself across the raised platform of stones. Bending at the waist, naked and exposed she glowed with embarrassment and hoped no one would cross their path. He entered her quickly from behind, and thrust deep within her, she groaned as his swelling stretched her insides. He pushed himself into her several times then withdrew just as quickly as he had entered her. He didn&#8217;t want this to end yet, and if he wasn&#8217;t careful, he would lose control. 

He took a few steps back, his erection shiny from her juices, tapping her on the shoulder her once more gave her the command, she lowered herself to her knees and tasted herself on him as she drew his engorged member slowly between her lips, her salty taste was the length of his shaft and she slide down his fullness cleaning her wetness from him. 

He placed one hand on each side of her head, restraining her, restricting her movements to almost nothing, she brought her hands up and clasped his wrists in self protection. �NO� he said firmly, she dropped her hands to her sides �don&#8217;t touch without permission� he instructed as he pushed forward into her mouth. His hands holding her head firmly but gently as he fucked her mouth tenderly, thrusting slowly and deeply into her. His hips gyrating slowly as he pushed in again and again.

She was delighted, his restriction increased her pleasure, his forcefulness excited her, she was so close to climax yet was forced to hold back, women didn&#8217;t cum unless the man had. She felt him thrust deeper, pushing against the back of her throat, she gagged a little and tried to pull back, but his hands held her firmly, his cock grew slightly as she resisted him, and swelled more as he pushed against the restriction of her throat. She breathed raggedly through her nose, her lips tight against his flesh as he pushed into her again, his manner so controlled, slow, purposeful, determined. 

As he pushed one last time, she felt his crown bulge, his climax was upon him and she was going to ensure it wasn&#8217;t snatched from her at the last minute. She pressed her tongue along his shaft and suckled, he groaned loudly and exploded his seed deep towards the back of her throat. She swallowed quickly and sucked again as his second wave of orgasm hit home. 

He withdrew his still pulsing cock from her lips, she moaned her displeasure, at its removal. He chuckled to himself. 


�look� he smirked holding her head inches from his twitching cock; His orgasm still fading, his cock still swollen with blood.

She stared at his manhood, her saliva still on the shaft, drips of his seed still in the eye, his balls still tight from their efforts.&nbsp; He let go of her head with one hand and pinched her nipple firmly�.. as the pressure increased she could hold back her excitement no longer. Her orgasm was upon her almost simultaneously. She moaned and rocked as he pinched and twisted, her mouth just inches away from his now fading manhood. She climbed the hill quickly, but intensely, and as quickly as she reached the peak, he released her nipple and walked away, leaving her to slide down from that peak alone. Ruining what was potentially the best orgasm she had ever had.
