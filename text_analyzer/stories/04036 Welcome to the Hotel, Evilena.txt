Evilena :� Welcome to the Hotel, Evilena
�
Evilena slid onto the barstool and pointed�a long, delicate finger toward��the bar tender, and crooked it. �He immediately hurried over to the stunning blond and asked what she wanted to drink.� 
�
"���Absolut...� straight up, ice cold, " she replied as he�scurried �away to fill her request.
�
The beautiful�blond�� looked around the busy hotel bar and knew trouble was about to start.� She understood the group psychology of a crowd in a�night club �and could feel that two of the patrons were giving off signals that blows were about to be struck.
�
Evilena �was visiting this upscale hotel as part of one of her frequent business trips, and thought she would check out the club and bar before she turned in, in the upper floor suite she had rented. She like crowds, and music, and fun.This hotel's club wasn't goth-enough for her, but she thought she'd stay a while and observe the crowd, while she listened to the band.
�
As the bartender placed her drink down in front of her, he�grinned a stupid ,enamored male grin�and said, " This one's on the house, beautiful."� She nodded and smiled a thank you.� She was used to such preferential treatment ( and inane comments) ,� but always remained� polite when she received an offering from a besotted stranger. 
�
Just then she heard a loud crash, and as she turned ,the two men she had previously spotted were rolling on the floor next to an overturned table, engaged in a loud, clumsy, amateurish fight.� Just as she had predicted .
�
A�large crowd gathered around the combatants, and watched as the two ,out of condition , drunken �men rolled around , like flopping fish, on the�wet bar��floor.
�
A few moments later�� she spotted , through the hotel windows , the flashing lights of a black and white squad car as it screeched to a stop in front of the club entrance.
�
A tall, sexy, muscular policewoman , in a tight fitting blue uniform, jumped out and confidently entered the bar.
�
Quickly�the cop �sized up the situation and decided that she would be able to control it herself , without any back-up .�Evilena heard her�speak �into her walkie-talkie , as she raised it to her mouth, �"Unit 7 .No assistance needed... I'll call in after I'm done."
�
The�fiery�haired �officer �approached the two , now exhausted,��brawlers �and gave each one a firm rap on the shins with her night stick and shouted, forcefully, " Knock it off you two.� You haven't done any damage to the bar yet, so I can let you go if you don't give me any shit. KNOCK IT OFF� !! "
�
Grabbing their pained shins,� ��both drunks stopped fighting� and�glanced �up at the�athletic looking female��officer .� One started to� argue but a stern �look from the intimidating red head stopped him.
�
She pulled both men �up by the shoulders of their jackets and shoved them toward �the front exit.� When out of the sight of most of the crowd she got their driver's licenses and id'ed both , then let them off with a warning.� Something about her intimidating personality and muscular build set off alarms bells in both men.� They did EXACTLY what she ordered.
�The red headed�policewoman �then strolled back into the bar and got information from the bartender and spoke a few words to him , to assure�the young man �she would be around if anything else happened.� The crowd looked on in admiration, but Evilena couldn't tell if it was for�the woman's �strength and skill at breaking up the fight or her beauty.
�
As the cop walked toward the door, Evilena spoke to her.� "� You did a good job with those guys. Do you always work without backup�, Officer James��? " The woman was a bit surprised Evilena knew her name but then remembered the �shiny silver name tag above her breast pocket that read " Patrol Officer Tori James" in large, engraved letters
�
"Yeah, most of the time I can handle a bar fight by myself, I'm in a "lonely precinct" out here in the hotel area.� It takes a while for backup to get here." Standing this close to Evilena the�officer could catch the scent of Hypnotic Poison, the blond's perfume. It was very seductive.� She wondered what brand the scent was. 
�
"The sexy blond's eyes sparkled, "� After the bar closes would you like to stop by my room for a drink ?"
�
All of a sudden the�attractive �cop became Joe Friday or Jane Wayne , " Sorry ma'am.� Can't drink on duty, ma'am .� Can't date people we meet on duty, ma'am . Got to leave."
�
Evilena laughed to herself, those Jane Wayne types, with their hair done up in buns�alway went by the book.� But�the redhead WAS�� cute, maybe she could play a little game with her later.� But right now she had a� drink to finish.
�
As the club was closing� , the sensuous blond rode the glass enclosed �lobby elevator up to her top floor suite and contemplated exactly how she would capture the red headed cop.� She wanted her.� And Evilena got EVERYTHING she wanted.� Suddenly, inspiration struck.
�She went to the mini bar, poured herself another���Absolut�, from one of those tiny hotel bottles, �and turned the music on LOUD and started to sway sensuously to the music.� Evilena was used to the throbbing beat of club music , but this was even loud�to her ears , and she KNEW someone in the �the hotel would complain, she hoped they would call the police.
�
Sure enough about fifteen minutes later there was a firm knock on the door.� Evilena smiled and walked over to open it.
�
As the door swung open there stood the same sexy cop that had broken up the fight in the hotel bar.� She shouted over the music, "� You'll HAVE to shut that music down, ma'am . �I've got complaints !� Shut it down. NOW !"
�
With� a�sensuous �little turn the beautiful blond walked over to the stereo and turned it off.
�
"OK now, "� Jane Wayne said in her best copese, "�You need to keep the�noise to a minimum.� Or I will have to run you in on a disturbing the peace charge.� Do you understand ma'am ?� And I'll have to see some id for my report before I go, do you have a driver's license, ma'am �?"
�
"Sure, I do officer James , it's right over here, in my purse.� I'll show it to �you."
�
The policewoman followed closely as Evilena walked over to the� counter where her purse was lying, and stood looking over her shoulder as she picked it up.
�
The red head spoke into her radio, "� Unit 7 . No back-up needed.� I'll check in later, out."
�
"As the�beautiful �blond hypnotist clicked open her bag , she said in a sultry, seductive �voice, " Look here , I have this pretty crystal in my purse with my driver's license. Want to take a look at it ?� Of course you do. It's so beautiful , and all us girls like beautiful things, don't we ?"
The purple tinged crystal was lovely.� It was pear shaped and hung from a fine gold chain. 
Evilena lifted it up and suspended it in front of the confused cop's eyes.���� � .
" It is a pretty piece of jewelry, isn't it.� Look at it Tori.�Focus your attention on it for a few moments. Watch as �it turns and spins.� Catching the light. �It is SO lovely.� Look at it as it spins and catches the light.� LOOK AT IT ! "
Officer James was always on alert for some sort of physical attack.� That was a part of her job, and she was good at her job. Her earlier �handling of the drunks proved that. �But she was NOT prepared for a psychic attack like this .� And she DID look at the spinning crystal, just as the hypnotist instructed.
Tori suddenly experienced vertigo, as if she were losing control.� She didn't LIKE losing control. What was going on ?
As�Evilena's hypnotic voice caressed her mind , and as she gazed at the crystal , all the other sounds in the room started to fade.� Soon all she could hear was� �Evilena's soft ,�somniferous voice.� And�then �all she could see was the spinning , purple�hued crystal and the flecks of light emanating from it .� She was confused. 
Evilena's soft, sensual,�mesmerizing �voice kept the sexy cop paralyzed as she continued to gaze, eyes unblinking at the spinning crystal.The purple colored specks of light flashed across her field of vision.
"Focus on the crystal , my dear.� Try to find it's center.� You MUST find it's very center. Search for it.� It's there, if only you can gaze intently enough to find it.� I know it's hard to look because the radiance of the reflections are so bright, but you MUST keep looking.� The light is so bright it makes you want to close your eyes, but fight it.� Keep looking.� No other noises except my voice now.� Nothing but the blinding radiance of the crystal and my voice exist now.� The light.... My voice ....."
Tori suddenly felt so helpless.... her head was spinning as she continued to stare at the bright, spinning crystal, unable to avert her gaze. She was aware of�everything that �was happening�yet �she couldn't stop looking at the spinning crystal . 
"Unable to look away,� but blinded by the crystal.� Maybe you can just blink your eyes to keep out the light that draws you into it's center.� It's OK to blink.� It's even OK if a little tear falls from your eyes.� It's SO bright.� So bright.� The light.... my voice FILL your senses. My words and my commands filling your mind.� Filling your thoughts.� Tori , My words are BECOMING your thoughts, and you can't resist.� You are helpless to resist.� You can't resist.� Your eyes stay closed longer each time you blink.� That's it....� longer...�� longer... now it's OK to let them stay closed.� Closed.... but you can still hear my wonderful voice and you know you �MUST obey Evilena's voice."
The redhead's� eyes blinked�again ... then once �more ... then remained closed.� 
Evilena lowered the crystal and moved even closer to the muscular cop, and whispered hotly in her ear, as she softly touched her face.
" Good girl.� You've done JUST as I commanded.� In fact you know now that you are only able to do as I command.� You can think only what Evilena allows you to think. You don't have the will power to resist me.� My will is SO much stronger than yours.� You are under my control now.� My control......
The hypnotist could see Tori's lips forming the words " your control"... but no sound came out and her eyes remained shut, as if she were talking in her sleep.
"Tori,dear. You know ONLY obedience.� It makes you feel so good to obey me.� It feels so nice that you want to obey me more so you can feel that wonderful pleasure EVERY time you obey my commands.� And the more you obey, the more you WANT to obey.� The more you NEED to obey.� Obey Evilena..... obey Evilena.... obey... obey ..."
The cop nodded in agreement, silently.� She had not been commanded to speak... and it felt so good to obey Evilena's commands.
"Tori, you� must submit totally .... give in totally ...surrender totally.....Surrender to Evilena� ... your new Mistress....� now I want you to open your eyes again only this time you�must �look deeply �into my hypnotic eyes.� You will be mesmerized.....hypnotized... by my eyes.� You will not be able to resist.... look into my eyes now, dear ...look into my eyes ..." 
The entranced cop opened her eyes and gazed directly at Evilena, who's face �was SO close to her now.� She was captured by the deep green power of Evilena's almost glowing eyes.� 
"Gaze into my eyes� and obey me Tori.....listen to my voice� and obey me Tori.� Obey me ....look into my eyes and obey ......"
The tall cop was standing, staring slack jawed into the depths of Evilena's irresistible eyes.� Just staring.� Her arms had moments before dropped to her sides and she stood motionless...staring ...listening. Lost in the depths of the hypnotist's green eyes.
"That's�right �dear just look deeply into my eyes and feel their hypnotic power.� The power to make you obey.� The power to enslave you.� Deeper into my eyes...� deeper under my spell... lost .... lost in my eyes....and every word.... every command makes you MORE� helpless ... more powerless before me ....more compliant� ...� more helpless.....weaker....weaker.....NEEDING to obey my words....� begging to obey my words.....and as I count from five to one all your will power.... ALL your power to resist me will be gone.....count along with me dear... and know when we reach zero you will be mine.� You will belong to Evilena... You will be her hypnotized slave."
"Five"
Tori heard Evilena say the number, then heard another, very familiar voice say "five."
"Four"
Once again that oh so familiar voice echoed Evilena's� words.
"Three"
Tori finally recognized the voice.� It was her own. "Three."
"Two"
"Two"
"One ..� and soon your total surrender will be here Tori...so soon."
"One," she helplessly echoed.
"Zero, and now you are mine." Evilena whispered in her ear then snaked her tongue across the tender flesh of the cops neck.
"Zero...I� ... am ... your� ... hypnotized ...slave...." 
Tori shivered with passion.� There was something erotic about surrendering herself to this beautiful, blond hypnotist, and deep in her mind she knew she would not try to escape....even if she could.
Evilena stepped back.� "� Undress for me my hypnotized slave, and answer EVERY command with� the words I am yours to command Evilena."
Slowly the cop began to undress, unbuttoning first her gun belt and letting it drop .�Her nightstick, gun , handcuffs and radio now lay on the floor, out of her reach.
Then she slowly unbuttoned her blue uniform shirt and Kevlar vest and threw them to the carpeted floor as well,�then �stood motionless , eyes wide open, before Evilena in her black bra.
"Now the trousers, dear."� The hypnotist softly commanded.
"I am yours to command Evilena, " she slowly repeated as the shoes, uniform trousers and black�socks �fell.
Now she stood before her mistress in black thong panties and her sexy bra, open to examination by her controller. She looked at Evilena as if she wanted to speak but found she could only gaze helplessly into her green eyes as the blond smiled malevolently
"Turn around for me, let me see your body, dear girl." Evilena ordered.
"I am yours to command , Evilena," she whispered as she turned around like a dancer or a body builder showing the blond hypnotist her muscular body.
"Let your hair hang free, pet."
As commanded the woman unfastened her hair and let her long , red tresses�flow freely.
Evilena moved nearer again and used her long,elegant nails to scratch Tori's now erect nipples and the cop moaned in surprise and longing. Deftly, the hypnotist reached behind the red head and unhooked her bra, throwing it to the floor to rest among her other abandoned clothing.
Tori's nipples stood erect, almost reaching toward Evilena of their own volition , needing her erotic touch again.She arched her back in an attempt to bring her breasts closer to her erotic conqueror
The�mesmerizing blond placed her warm hands on Tori's bare shoulders and gently guided her to her knees, in abject supplication before�her new owner. With a smile she reached over and� picked up her glass of vodka and poured a slow, cold trickle of Absolut down across her taut belly.
"Lick it." she commanded.
And James crawled closer and began to use her tongue to sensuously lick the cold liquid from Evilena's stomach.� They both moaned.
"The panties dear.... the panties..." Evilena whispered as she held out her hand.
Tori fumbled with her black silk thong and slipped it off, the offered it to the sensuous hypnotist.
Evilena entwined her fingers in the cops hair and pulled back her head, then thrust the panties into he mouth so�the red head�could taste her own juices.
Unable to resist, totally enslaved by Evilena's gaze,Tori savored the taste of her own nectars, licking, and sucking on the thongs.� Suddenly Evilena pulled them back.
"Now me." she instructed knowing the cop could no longer resist ANY command .
The entranced cop pushed her face into Evilena's skirt, desperately trying to lick her goddess, making the skirt itself wet with her saliva.
Evilena threw her head back and laughed triumphantly.
Just then the radio crackled.� " Unit 7.� Unit 7.� If you are 10-8 we have a call in your area."
"Tell them you'll be done soon, dear.� In a normal voice."
The kneeling cop reached over for her walkie-talkie and� pressed the key, " I'll be 10-8 as soon as I finish here.� Hold the call and I'll respond as soon as I get back to the car.
Evilena held the naked policewoman's breast in her warm hand and sighed. "� Duty calls dear girl.� Get dressed and stand up." She kissed the entranced woman with an open mouthed, tongue twisting kiss. Again they both moaned. 
The cop picked up all of her clothing and stood up� in front of Evilena, looking exactly as she had when she first knocked on the hotel room door, save the fact that her long hair now hung�loosely �down her back.
"Now Tori.� Go finish your shift.� Be the good cop you are.� Answer every call.� But when your tour of duty is complete you will return here to serve me more completely.� Do you understand ? "
"I am yours to command Evilena." was her response.
Now when I snap my fingers you will be awake and alert and remember nothing of what has happened here except that you know you will return to see me when your shift is over and you know you will again enter this deep, exciting, enjoyable hypnotic trance the moment you here me say.� Tori belongs to Evilena.� Understand ?"
" I am yours to command Evilena, Tori belongs to Evilena ....."
And with a snap of the hypnotist's fingers, the cop became awake and alert and laughably spoke. "� So keep that radio quiet will you?� I've got another call."
"Of course officer James, I'll do exactly as you say," Evilena responded , smiling ironically.
As the red headed policewoman walked down the�hotel corridor � she licked her lips.�
" Vodka?� Pussy Juices?� What are those tastes in my mouth ?" she wondered.
Strange new thoughts kept running through her mind as she headed for the elevator. And then she had a BRILLIANT idea� .� Maybe I'll come back�to the hotel �after I get off and surprise�the �woman who was playing the loud music .� She IS pretty cute !� I've never even�LIKED girls before but there� is�SOMETHING about that Evilena.

Evilena: Welcome to the Hotel , Evilena.� Part 2
�
by Mistress Evilena's Servant
�

�
FF MC
�
�
Officer Tori James walked away from Evilena's hotel suite .�� The further she walked, the less clear her memory became.� The hypnotic commands she had just� heard were fading from her mind...� at least they SEEMED to be.
�
As Tori slid into the front seat of her squad car the radio crackled, "� Burglary in Progress.....322 South Main Street....all nearby units respond...."
�
The redhead turned the key in the ignition, and put the cruiser into gear, as she picked up the microphone attached to the dashboard.� "� I'm en route, and I'll cover the back."
�
A few moments later she turned off the lights and drifted , into a parking spot where she could see the doorway in the rear of the building.�� �"10-23 " she said softly into the radio as she got out and approached the warehouse .� Suddenly�a metal door flew open and a large man , dressed in black, �ran out, saw� Tori and changed directions, attempting to flee up a narrow alleyway next to the building.�
�
Officer James �drew her black nightstick from the ring on her belt and imitated a move she had learned from an older cop, sailing the baton down the ally, skipping it on the ground a few steps behind the fleeing burglar.� As expected, the stick bounced up and struck the man in the back of his knees, tangling up in his legs as��he ran.� He fell in a heap in the alley, dazed, immobile , and confused.
�
Tori ran up and forced his hands behind his back and handcuffed him�, then �spoke into her walkie-talkie.� "� You can slow down response to this call , " I've got the burglar in custody, but you might want to send a search team in case he has accomplices." 
�
As her back up arrived she was congratulated by the other officers for her quick action and her successful apprehension of the thief, and as the rest of the police personnel searched the building and surrounding area she placed her prisoner in the cage in the back of her car and headed toward the station to book and process him
�
As she drove off two male officer shook their heads, amazed, " She may be a woman, but she's the toughest cop I've ever seen, " said the one.
�
"Yeah I'd hate to try to boss her around, " the second laughed, feeling sorry for their watch commander. I bet NOBODY can tell HER what to do. 
�
After booking her prisoner, the red headed cop sat a desk in the station writing her reports for the night.� Two fights, a traffic ticket, and a burglary arrest.� Wasn't there a loud music call too ? She couldn't seem to remember.� But there was a reason, she thought, that she went to the hotel room of that sexy blond. If she could just recall. Her memory wasn't always this bad. 
�
Tori wasn't alesbian, in fact, she was almost asexual, her job� taking up so much time, but as she continued writing she kept thinking back to the amazingly beautiful face of the woman in the hotel, what was her name Evilena ? And the thoughts excited her. 
�
But why ?
�
And why�had she been in�the blond's �room ? Hadn't she told her that she couldn't meet her ?� But.... again her thoughts began to wander back toward the beautiful woman . And her eyes... beautiful, deep �green eyes. 
�
Her �shift was almost over and she had an overwhelming urge to go back to the hotel.� But why ?� To see Evilena ?� No.... � No!� That wasn't right.� That would be a violation of departmental rules to socialize with a person she handled a complaint against.� But there was no compliat or even a report about Evilena in today's folder of papers she turned in to her supervisor. 
�
She shook her head to clear it of all these confusing thoughts as she changed her clothes in the locker room.� She pulled off the black sports bra she wore under her uniform and bullet proof vest and rummaged through her locker for a sexy outfit.� She slipped on the black wonder-bra that had been hanging there since she changed after the last police ball.� Magically her already� respectable breasts turned in to major hooters.� She slipped on her tightest �jeans� and a short black tee top, grabbed her shoulder holster and off duty Glock 19 , then slipped on blue�wool-blend blazer , and was out the door.����
�
" Why did I change into this fuck me bra ?� Who am I trying to impress ? " she wondered to herself, as she shook her long red hair so it flowed sexily down her back .� Then she�sat down��behind the wheel of �her car , turned the ignition , and started to drive home.
�
Fifteen minutes later she pulled up in the parking lot of Evilena's� hotel, and blinked her eyes.� What was she doing here ? Home was the opposite way .
�
Maybe she was just tired and had kind of dozed off while she was trying to drive�to her apartmenrt�and came here by accident.� "I'll have a cup of coffee in the diner here, then I'll head to my residence " she thought as she got out of the car.
�
The next thing she knew she was standing in front of the blond woman's suite, hand extended, ready to knockon the door .
�
"Stop ! " she thought to herself.�" What am I doing ?� Why can't I think straight today ?"
�
Suddenly the door swung open, and there stood Evilena. Her long blond hair streamed down her back, and her face was GORGEOUS.� She was dressed in a black leather halter top and matching leather shorts.��Long, almost knee length boots completed �the ensemble .�� Definitely a kinky outfit, the cop thought.
�Tori was stunned by her appearance.
�
"Hi...I'm the�officer �that was here earlier... my name is Torie James and maybe� you don't recognize me because I'm not in uniform and I don't uusually do this but I thought I'd stop by and I really didn't even plan to come here I just sort of found myself in your hallway and I didn't mean to disturb you and ....." the usually calm and collected police woman rattled on and on, hardly in control of her own voice.� 
�
Evilena stepped back and beckoned the� nervous redhead with her index finger.� "Do you want to come it ?� Just say Yes ma'am, and you can, you know...."
�
The police woman looked directly into Evilena's eyes.... " Yes ma'am" she replied.
�
"Good girl.� You have already made a wonderful choice.� You are here and you have decided to come in, now don't you feel better ?� Just say yes ma'am so I know...."
�
"Yes ma'am..." Tori whispered as she walk further into the room, never breaking eye contact with the mysterious blond.� Her mind was spinning now.� She DID know this woman.�� She HAD been here before.� Memories were flooding back, and she somehow was thinking of the color purple, but didn't know why.
�
"I'm going to� tell you a secret Tori. Would you like that ?
�
"Yes ma'am...."
�
I'm going to tell you the difference between giving up and letting go.� Giving up implies that you are involved in a struggle with me.�And my mind is MUCH to powerful for you to even TRY to resist. �Letting go says you WANT to willingly give up control to a power that is stronger than yourself.... so willingly .....wouldn't you like to let go dear.... isn't that the reason you are here.... to let go ? "
�
James mulled that complicated thought over in her mind, but she had been right every other time she had answered Evilena's questions, utilizing just two words. � She knew the correct answer....." Yes ma'am..." she softly responded. 
�
The blond hypnotist reached out and stroked Tori's cheek with her finger nails...."Good girl.� You know that it feels so good to let go.� Let go to my power .� Let go of all resistance... of all thoughts....of all thoughts other �than those I give you .... let go......."
�
"Y...yes ma'am..."her eyes were widening and her� gaze becoming fixed on only Evilena's deep green eyes.
�
Again that spinning feeling, as if she were falling INTO the blond's hypnotic stare. .� As if her eyes were becoming her whole universe.....let go .....�in Her eyes...let go.....� even the words� , were seemed to be spinning in her brain......
�
Evilena pointed at the door with a graceful gesture. " Close the door, my dear..."
�
Gaze still locked on those deep, green ,powerful eyes , James reached back and pushed the door slowly shut.� "Yes ma'am," she whispered, hardening nipples pushing at the silken fabric of her wonder-bra.
�
"Yes ma'am, " she repeated...
�
Evilena had��yet to begin her hypnotic induction, but this constant repetition of a phrase connoting submission and�Tori's �immediate compliance with her command told her that the red head was almost hypnotizing herself.� Needing to obey, wanting to be under Evilena's spell again. The sultry hypnotist smiled.
�
"You look warm ,dear.� Can I help you out of that jacket ?"
�
"Yes ma'am"
�
The beautiful blond reached out and removed the business-like blue blazer, leaving Tori dressed in� her snug fitting blue jeans and a short, tight tee top which showed off her enhanced hooters.�And her shoulder holster . �As she removed the jacket Evilena brushed her hands over the policewoman's nipples.� They�jutted out , now �rock hard.
�
As the redhead stood slack jawed , still gazing deep into Evilena's eyes, the blond stuck a finger in Tori's mouth. 
�
"Suck," she commanded, and the helpless girl wrapped her lips around the delicate finger as if it were an erect cock.
�
"Yeff ma'am " she mumbled, rubbing her lips across the invading finger, tongue laciviously swirling around the digit.
�
Then , �a glimmer of resistance registered in Tori's eyes.� Why was she doing this ?� She was a tough , hard cop who kowtowed to no one.� Not even� �this��dangerous ��woman.� She was being assaulted . This was a sexual assault ! This bitch was going to jail !
�
She stepped back and pulled out the Glock� 9mm she carried in her shoulder rig, and tried to shout out, to order this woman to stop.� But she found� hard even to speak, as once again her�gaze �locked onto Evilena's eyes .
�
"My goodness, dear, are you STILL�trying to resist �?� It does you no good, my pet . You KNOW you must let go and let me take over.� You know you can't resist me.� Deep in your heart you KNOW.� Don't You ?"
�
Tori wavered and her arm lowered. She needed to say something.� But what ?She felt so weak, so powerless when she stared into THOSE eyes. 
�
"That's right pet , the gun IS heavy isn't it ? It feels so heavy you must drop it.� You must.� Just keep looking into my eyes and drop the gun. DROP THE GUN. "
�
"Yes ma'am " was the helpless reply as the automatic slipped from her hand , dropping on the carpeted floor.
�
Her will�had been �broken.
�
"Good girl," Evilena whispered and moved closer and whispered hotly into the red head's ear. " You are hypnotized dear.� Under my spell.� Controlled by me.� Your thoughts belong to me.� Your mind belongs to me.� Your body belongs to me.� You are mine, aren't you pet ?"
�
"Y... y... yes ma'am." she replied, the last remnants of independent thought drifting away.� She�had been �captured and enslaved by Evilena's eyes. She WANTED to belong to Evilena. 
�
" Now let me see your breautiful breasts, sweetie, they are�so sexy �and you WANT to show them to me.� Such pretty titties to show me.� Show me your pretty titties, my pet.
�
"Yes Ma'am, " was the unhesitating response as the tee shirt and bra were thrown to the floor.� The ability to resist was fading from Tori's mind, as she fell deeper and deeper under the spell Evilena was skillfully weaving.
�
With a smile the blond hypnotist again leaned closer and whispered�to�Tori �, then darted her tongue into�the red head's �ear� " The sensations you feel�on your beautiful breasts you will ALSO feel in your wet .... wet ... pussy.� Do you understand ?"
�
"Yes ma'am ."
�
Then the blond lightly drew�a long�fingernail across the exposed nipples , so tempting and vulnerable, naked before her.
�
Tori shuddered.� She felt the tickling sensation on her stiff nipples AND in her pussy.� She was becoming SO moist.� Again Evilena's fingernails lightly caressed Tori's beautiful areola . Now Tori's legs felt so weak as her�knees trembled.� Lust was coursing through Her body.
�
"Do you want to speak, my pet ?� You may if you like."
�
"Ohhhhhh... " the redhead moaned in response....."Ahhhhhhh..."� she exclaimed� as the feelings��swept �through her sensitive tits and moist cunt.� " Please....PLEEEEAAASSSSEEEE...."
�
"Please what my pet.� Please what ?"
�
"Please let me cum,ma'am." she begged. She could do NOTHING without Evilena's permission now.
�
"� Let you, dear �? I'll make you ....... cum dear, " was the laughing reply.
�
Again, Tori's legs shook.
�
"Cum."
�
Her knees�grew weaker and weaker. 
�
"CUM !"
�
And each time she heard Evilena's command she exploded with passion.
�
"CUM, �my little fucktoy ........CUM ! "
�
And then , shaking with lust ,�defeated cop �fell to her knees , thrusting her own hand inside�her tight jeans where the moisture had stained them, showing EXACTLY the control Evilena had over the orgasmic red head.
�
The hypnotist reached down and entwined her fingers in Tori's long red hair and pulled back, tilting her head upward.� She drew her face closer and closer and parted her lips.� The cop opened her mouth as if to kiss her new owner and as Evilena drew close, she spit in her open mouth.� Tori coughed, then swallowed. Humiliated, but�helplessly excited. 
�
Now Evilena yanked at the long red hair and pulled�her hypno-slave toward the king sized bed in the suite.� "Crawl behind me, " she commanded, and the soaking wet cop crawled behind like a dog at heel.
�
Evilena pointed at the bed.� " Up girl, and get those jeans off NOW! "
�
Tori scrambled to the bed, removing the remnants of her clothing as she did so.� Then , she got to her hands and knees on the bed and looked at Evilena, expectantly.
�
The blond hypno-domme ran her fingers through the cop's wet hair and petted her as if she were some type of domestic animal , then once again thrust her finger into her mouth and smiled as her helpless slave girl involuntarily sucked.
�
"Kiss my hand," she ordered and Tori kissed,licked and sucked as if Evilena's hand were the most sensual thing in the world."You may now put your fingers in your own pussy dear while I pinch your breasts.� You remember , don't you that any sensation you feel on your tits you also feel in your pussy don't you?"
�
"Yes ma'am" she responded and started to finger fuck herself. 
�
Then, ever so lightly, Evilena drew a fingernail across Tori's nipples, then squeezed one between her forefinger and thumb. 
�
Tori moaned�, helplessly.� The sensations were overwhelming.� Again, she exploded.
�
"AhhhhhhEEEEEEEEEEOOOOOOOOOO!" she screamed.
�
"Now taste �yourself my little fucktoy ," came the command " And look into my eyes."
�
Tori's fingers came up to her mouth as she was once again� held captive by Evilena's hypnotic gaze .� Once more she felt as if she was being drawn�INTO �those bottomless green eyes as Evilena spoke, sofly, but irresistibly . " That taste on your fingers is the second most addicting taste you will ever experience. You will long to taste your own juices every day."
�
Then Evilena reached inside her own shorts and gathered her own moist secretions on the tip of her finger�, "THIS , however will be the taste and fragrance that will control you.� Any time you smell this, " she waved her finger under Tori's nose, " or taste this," she stuck her finger into the cop's mouth," you will again be under my hypnotic spell.� You will belong to me.� Say it dear."
�
"Anytime I smell or taste you, I will again be under your spell.� I belong to you, Mistress."
�
" Good girl, now watch closely."
�
Evilena took off all her clothing and the two women touched bodies, the heat was palpable. And the night turned into morning.... slowly ....passionately.
�
�
**************************************************************************************************
�
�
A month had passed and once again Evilena was returning to a round of important business meetings.
�
As she stepped out onto the sidewalk�outside �the airport terminal, there was a black and white squad car parked in the driveway by the entrance . � The sexy red headed cop driving the�cruiser �was in full dress uniform, as if waiting for the mayor or governor. 
�
Evilena tossed her suitcase into the back seat and slid into the front seat , next to Tori.� She placed her hand on the back of the red head's neck and pushed�the cop's �head downward into her lap, and the�woman �inhaled deeply.
�
She sat up, a glazed look in her eyes, " I belong to you Mistress Evilena " were her only words.
�
" I know dear , let's go to the Hotel and play fucktoy again." Evilena whispered. She pulled Tori's face to hers and licked the helpless police officer's parted lips.
�
"Yes Ma'am ,"�came �the cops reply.� " Yes ma'am ."
