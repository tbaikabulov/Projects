Synopsis:   A young lady is converted into the perfect slave.






The started as any other, she woke up went to work, was her usual efficient self, came home, fed her cat, cooked dinner and went to bed. No sense of foreboding came to her, none of the famous �female intuition� nothing out of the ordinary in fact. It was just another day to strike off the gray calendar of her life. But that night was not gray, it was black, black as the rose she found in the morning. 
She lived alone with just a black cat for company, the cat was the only sign that she actually lived. It was her only identification to the world. She had bought him when he was full grown the store owner said his name was Mr. Thomas and she didn&#8217;t change it. She never spoke to him just fed him and cleaned up after him. Mr. Thomas and her work were the two things that dominated her life. She was an architect, in a very large firm which meant she designed building not houses, most of her work involved structural engineering and she was good at it. She worked longer and harder than anyone else, but not with any particular sense of pride. She never bothered to look at a building she had worked on, to her it was just a problem to solve and move on. She left on the same time every day, leaving herself enough time to drive home, feed Mr. Thomas, finish her chores and go to bed. She did the same things that day, left at the usual time, slept at the usual time.&nbsp; 
But she did not wake at her usual time; she woke very suddenly in the middle of the night feeling very stifled. She tried to rub her eyes and found she couldn&#8217;t.&nbsp; Strangely she did not feel fear or panic, she felt curiosity something she hadn&#8217;t felt in years�..but soon she was feeling too many things to analyze. She was feeling hands on her body, she was feeling lips, the rough scrape of a mask, rough strong rope, smooth tight silk, cold night breeze over her body, slaps across her face more pain as hands kneaded her soft flesh, the sharp tweak as she protested without sound and then suddenly without warning her legs were kicked apart and she was taken. Just like that. But it wasn&#8217;t over. He stayed where he was and she heard him breathing and his hands moved in her dark hair pulling them so her neck was stretched out she saw a thin sharp blade glimmer in the dark heard his laugh as she trembled helplessly her hands tied mouth gagged, the knife slowly touched her flushed face travelled to her stretched neck. She was very still, didn&#8217;t dare to move. For the first time in her life she did not want to die and the knife moved lower and lower to the top of her breast where it pierced her skin as suddenly as he had entered her. The knife made a long line on the top of her left breast and then he withdrew, pulling out a black rose he laid it across the cut and whispered in her ear �The next time be prepared�. 
Then he had cut the knot on the ropes leaving them still coiled about her wrists and left. She remained where she was hearing the front door close, lying there gagged wrists tied behind her back, legs apart his cum oozing out of her cunt and a thin line of blood on her breast. She knew what she must do of course; call the police, go to a doctor get herself examined and get the locks checked ask the apartment guards how he got in���all these instructions went through her mind like the impersonal instructions of a stranger as she lay there.&nbsp; She stayed as she was until morning; when the sun hit her naked assaulted body and then she rose slowly the ropes fell away easily as she shook them off. She left the gag on however and stood before the mirror, her night gown had been torn vertically so it hung off her shoulders. She saw her half naked body, bruised all over, deep red marks enough evidence that she had been raped the gag still over her mouth. Her first thought was �How kind of him to not mark my face or wrists�. Mr. Thomas was standing by her bed looking at her rather imperiously. She smiled as she held the rose for a long time then deliberately shrugging she threw it into the bin along with the gag, she bathed and dressed as usual repeating to herself �Rapists never attack twice, he won&#8217;t be back, he&#8217;s too well prepared to take the risk�. She forced herself to remain in office up to her usual time, forced herself to lock the doors. She fed Mr. Thomas again and cleaned out his litter box before turning off the lights and going to bed. But she could not sleep, she tossed and turned alert for every sound, but nothing��midnight came and then dawn and then morning�.she would not let herself be disappointed she simply told herself that he wasn&#8217;t likely to come. For the first time in her life she spoke to Mr. Thomas �Well Mr. Thomas� she began as she mixed his food and he sat on the table watching her �you know what happened yesterday, I suppose you think I should have gone to the police?� she broke off to glance across at Mr. Thomas who returned her gaze his large green eyes fixed on her �But you see there really wasn&#8217;t any point I mean� she said shrugging �he raped me�, there was a strange thrill in saying the word aloud, in admitting that it had in fact happened. �it&#8217;s over,&nbsp; he&#8217;s not coming back� she forced herself to say as she scrubbed Mr. Thomas&#8217; litter box under his fixed stare �why should he take the risk? So there really isn&#8217;t any point going ahead with this, is there?� she asked the last two words a little uncertain. Mr. Thomas simply got up and leapt off the dining table leaving his food untouched and walking away. �Oh Mr. Thomas!� she exclaimed picking up the bowl and going after him. She followed him around for the better part of an hour before he deigned to eat. 
Das passed, a week, a fortnight and nothing happened. She slowly started sleeping normally, the wounds on her body almost healed, some days she even forgot that she had been raped and then he came back. As suddenly as he had the last time, but this time he announced his presence with a single black rose, she saw it as soon as she unlocked the door, a black rose lying on her coffee table and Mr. Thomas staring up at her, she fancied she could almost see the contempt on Mr. Thomas&#8217; face but told herself she was being silly. She didn&#8217;t know what to think, her body was reacting so fast, her mind in overdrive, was he still here? Had he come and left, angry because she wasn&#8217;t available? Her eyes moved to her bedroom door, it was shut. Was he there? Waiting�.and if he was�.what would she do? Oh God!! Let him come as before in the dark she prayed I can&#8217;t face him she whispered desperately. Slowly she turned the handle of the door and swung it open.
It was empty, there was no body there. Oh thank god!!!!! She prayed. Then as realization sunk in�.as she slowly understood what it meant�..she was going to be raped��again. She should go her mind said. Get out of the apartment��.go back to her office and stay there��or call the security�..but her feet carried her forward to the telephone by the bed her hands picked it up and savagely tore the line, throwing the instrument down. She quickly fed Mr. Thomas and got into bed, leaving the front door unlocked. Her body trembling hands cold lips dry as she waited in the dark. He took a long time, it was well past midnight when she heard the door open and she stiffened closing her eyes tight taking a deep breath as she waited. Footsteps approaching her bed�.she kept her eyes shut not wanting to see�to be able to identify�.the covers pulled off�.she waited breathing fast a smile on her face��.she felt a hard slap, so violent her lip split she gasped her eyes flying open. He was masked again he kneed her soft stomach so she gasped doubling over then grabbed her hair and slapped her again. She was crying now....there was no more excitement just pain and fear. "Bitch I told you to be prepared� she heard him say in a rough rasping voice. �But I left the door open� she sobbed feeling her tender lip. Another slap this time so hard she fell off the bed. He put his foot on her head pressing it into the floor she heard him laugh �You stupid bitch, whoever hired you as an architect? Remember how I left you? That is how you must be� and then he kicked her middle again and left. She remained where she was on the floor. She saw Mr. Thomas wake up walk across to her look at her, on the floor sobbing in agony, then he leapt lightly on to her bed and curled up on it. She touched her sore aching cheeks cursing herself for her stupidity. She slowly put ice on her split lip berating herself, telling herself that now he would definitely not be back��not after she proved how dumb she was. She glanced at the bed Mr. Thomas was curled right in the center so she went to the living room and fell asleep on the couch.
She woke with a bad headache and feeling miserable. �I deserve this� she told herself angrily. �He had told me to be better prepared, he let me know that he would be here and I was such a fool�. Well he&#8217;s certainly not coming back now. And he didn&#8217;t a month passed with no sign of roses. She took to sleeping naked with her door unlocked just in case He showed up. And then one day there it was again, only this time she saw it in in her office after her lunch break, a black rose with a long stem on her keyboard. She gasped when she saw it, she had locked her office when she went to lunch��this meant He knew where she worked, he had gotten into her house and now���..into her office. No, no, no her mind screamed as she sat staring at the rose. How does he know where I work? Who is he? She considered reporting the matter, but then����.what would she say? Should she admit to being raped nearly 2 months ago and keeping quiet about it? She had no proof����.the marks were all gone from her body, there was no sign of breaking and entering�����and if she didn&#8217;t say that�����well a black rose on her comp? No one would take that seriously. Should she wait to be raped and then report it? YES!!!!! her head snapped up, that might just be a good idea, she could report it immediately and��.and then��.well maybe it would be enough to scare him off. But that meant that tonight���������tonight she was going to be raped. �I&#8217;m going to be raped� she whispered to herself. �He&#8217;s coming Mr. Thomas� she said as soon as she entered. Mr. Thomas remained curled in her best armchair and did not respond. She finished her chores quickly and went to her bedroom, dragging out the ripped gown from her closet she put it on. �I must be more careful this time� she told herself �I can&#8217;t bear him to leave again�.
She giggled a little at her own haste, at the nervous trembling in her hands as she gagged herself, there was no rope so she just put her hands behind her back and crossed her lips. The black rose was on her bedside and she lay in the dark half naked, her body alert, feeling a wetness between her thighs as she waited eagerly.&nbsp; She watched the clock, waiting impatiently keeping herself still as if her hands were really tied, she heard a soft padding and her head turned sharply alert as she strained to see, it was only Mr. Thomas. She watched as he slowly came into her bedroom and leapt up lightly on an armchair watching her, his eyes moving over her wide eyes, rumpled hair, gagged mouth����she wished she could tell him to go away, but her hands were tied and she was gagged. �I&#8217;m helpless� she told herself and felt an answering thrill in her cunt. She lay there on the bed still and waiting and Mr. Thomas watched her and then the door opened, she closed her eyes wanting to see and yet not daring to, soft footsteps moved closer towards her. She could feel him look at her half naked body, she hoped the sight pleased him. She almost moaned with relief when she heard a chuckle and felt gloved hands on her breast. �Almost there bitch, you just forgot a few things but I guess that&#8217;s to be expected from a dumb woman�, it was the same voice, rough, husky and deep. She trembled opening her eyes slowly looking up at the masked face. She could just make out two very black eyes and a mouth, his body was all in black, black jeans and a black full sleeved shirt, hands gloved feet booted, there was no way she could identify him even if���.and then all thought left her as the hands started to move on her body. They were the most wonderful incredible hands ever she thought as she felt the gloved tips touch lightly on her belly, so incredibly gentle they moved all over her, just the fingertips no other part of his body touched her and she moaned aching for more the tips of his fingers so skillfull and so light they just skimmed over her body circling just over her nipples until she arched her back wanting a deeper touch. She heard his chuckles his laughs as he played with her body keeping her waiting, taunting her and then she felt her gag removed, but before she could protest or move it was on her eyes and she was blindfolded. Then her hands were taken and spread apart, she felt cold steel and knew they had been handcuffed to the bed. She moaned greedily, eager, impatient head thrown back, thrusting her tits wanting so badly to be taken. But he didn&#8217;t pay any attention; he stood back looking at her prone stretched figure, picturing her as she left for work every day contrasting what she was then and what he had turned her into.&nbsp; He smiled to himself as she parted her lips, moaning and grunting softly, he took off his gloves and placed his bare hands on her breasts holding them in his palms, feeling the texture and softness. She gave a loud gasp as she felt him touch her for the first time and his smile widened �oh this is going to be really easy� he grinned as he saw her wet glistening cunt. It was hard, it was very hard to not make her what she should be, what she would be immediately, but no, he must wait, it would be just sex for now���and then, he grinned to himself and then she would just be a very profitable investment. Yes the firm would be pleased with this particular thing he smiled as he mounted the moaning trembling woman. He didn&#8217;t bother with any more foreplay, she had felt enough pleasure he decided tightening his hands on her breasts squeezing them hard lowering his mouth taking the hard red nipples between his teeth almost biting them off to hear the pain in her voice, the whimpering cry as he pinched and squeezed her body. He bit down hard on her breast as he entered her, slapping her face over and over as he fucked her, ignoring her squeals and her whimpers as his hands moved on her trim smooth belly, clutching the sides as he buried himself deeper and deeper in her. He gave a single grunt of satisfaction as he finished oh she&#8217;s good he thought, she&#8217;s perfect for what we want. 
He got off the bed watching her, her breath was still quick face swollen with his slaps, lips parted her tongue darting out to lick her swollen bruised lips, he grabbed her head at the sight of the small pink tongue and kissed her deep, he felt her body stiffen in surprise and melt under him as she pressed herself closer. He kept his hand in her hair holding her tightly as his tongue moved in her mouth, he grabbed her small tongue between his teeth and bit down hard tasting her blood holding her so she wouldn&#8217;t move, then released her abruptly so she fell back on the bed. Strange, she looked satisfied, he grinned and glanced around the room noticing the bare walls, there was no decoration nothing that could be described as personal, except��..the cat he noticed the animal for the first time as it watched them. A thin smile curled his lips as he picked up the cat �be very quiet bitch� he whispered �one sound and I&#8217;ll never come back� he smirked as she pressed her lips together immediately not even breathing loudly, he walked towards her softly making sure the cuffs and blindfold were still on, then he slowly placed the cat on her belly, chuckling as he heard the small gasp quickly muffled from her. �Spread your legs cunt let&#8217;s see how attached you are to Mr. Thomas� he said aloud, another gasp her mind reeled now he even knew Mr. Thomas&#8217; name. Who was this guy? She thought and then oh God!!!!&nbsp; Mr. Thomas!!!!!! Mr. Thomas was walking on her body not bothering to sheathe his claws on her soft breasts until he reached her face, licking her, she could hear her laptop, he was using her laptop and Mr. Thomas was now nuzzling her neck. But he&#8217;s a cat her mind said confused, how can he�..but he was and her body was reacting as the sharp claws pricked her soft flesh she got wetter and wetter and then and then Mr. Thomas curled himself on her and fell asleep his whiskers tickling her nipples. She moaned out helplessly and heard an answering laugh. �Very good cunt, that&#8217;s how you&#8217;ll sleep every night� she heard and then he pulled off her blindfold turning on the lights �I&#8217;ll be back tomorrow� he said and un-cuffing her hand walked out. She lay still again, wondering if she should rouse Mr. Thomas, but she kind of liked the constant tickle on her nipple, liked the warm weight on her body and he said he would come back tomorrow she whispered to herself. Maybe��maybe I should dress up��.put on a little makeup�..but what if he leaves again? She was feeling very confused, very dazed as she fell into a deep sleep.
The next morning wasn&#8217;t much better, she was still hurting from the previous night, she couldn&#8217;t even bear to look at Mr. Thomas and she was still scared about how much He knew about her and she still shrank from going to the police. For the first time in her life she took a half day and left work early, no one even commented or asked me anything she thought, do they even know I exist. I walked in all bruised and no one bothered����.well He knows I exist she thought and a small smile appeared on her face, he knows where I live and what I do and everything about me and suddenly it seemed comforting��she knew in the back of her mind that this was probably a sick and twisted way of thinking but her head hurt and she really really didn&#8217;t want to think any more. It doesn&#8217;t matter she told herself it&#8217;s just something I&#8217;m doing for myself�..like I have a boyfriend she giggled and it&#8217;s not like I have anything better, this is the most exciting thing I&#8217;ve ever had in my life she thought. It was a rather long walk from her office to her apartment but she didn&#8217;t mind she had too much to think about. So by the time she was back she had made her decision, she would simply do what she was told. 
The next few weeks passed quickly. She was fucked every night by the man and then nuzzled and licked by Mr. Thomas who seemed to like sleeping on her soft breasts. The only thing that changed was her dedication to her work she going later and coming back quicker every day. Her backlog kept growing, but she did not care, the only thing that mattered was to be ready for Him. She knew that she was going deeper and deeper into something that could be dangerous, but that just served to excite her, she had known for a long time that there was a world where such dark pleasures existed, she had just never thought that she could be a part of it. One night, when he was more violent than usual when he had used her over and over slapped and&nbsp; punched her so her entire body ached kicked her with his boots and yet taken her demanding a response demanding everything she could give, he kicked her onto the floor and made her go on her fours and took her cunt from behind then pinned her against the wall slamming into her, all the time wanting her wet and ready, wanting her to moan and squirm under him, she sensed this night was special that it was a sort of gateway to something deeper and she responded with every bit of herself. She panted and trembled under him, begged him to take her over and over, moaned in ecstasy when he hurt her ignored her body&#8217;s protests and begged for more. Finally, he grunted in satisfaction and released her, she saw the knife flash again and stiffened. He didn&#8217;t have to tie or gag her this time she remained still as the knife worked on her body.&nbsp; After he had finished he stood up �tomorrow if you go to work you never see me again, if you stay home then we talk� and then he picked up Mr. Thomas, she lay straight hoping Mr. Thomas wouldn&#8217;t walk too much as the cuts on her breast still hurt. He grinned, shook his head and left carrying Mr. Thomas with him. She knew she should be shocked probably angry after all Mr. Thomas was hers he couldn&#8217;t just�����but she found herself too tired to care. As she fell asleep she thought �it&#8217;s a good thing he told me to stay home tomorrow� and feel into a deep tired sleep.
She woke late the next morning not caring that she hadn&#8217;t called work, she almost ran to the mirror to see what he had written, there was a single word written across her breast �DAMIEN� she repeated the name to herself whispering it aloud feeling herself get wet as she repeated the word. She dressed carefully wearing a thin summer dress which left her arms and knees bare and was cut deep enough to show the word cut across her breasts. She didn&#8217;t bother with makeup letting the bruises show, giggling a little as she told herself it was probably futile to dress anyway. He came as he always did simply unlocking her door, she was watching TV when she heard the door open and quickly stood up smiling uncertainly. He was still masked and dressed in black and she felt his eyes on her moving across her small slender body, then he fingered the word across her breasts and said �so now you know my name, do you know yours?&#8217; the name was on the tip of her tongue but a warning in his eyes stopped her and she simply shook her name he laughed, the sound she had heard so often and sat in a high backed chair �Your name is Cherry my dear, now� he said leaning forward looking at her intently �do you want to be Cherry?�. She was confused and her face showed it, �i�.i don&#8217;t understand� she said softly only knowing that this wasn&#8217;t a game anymore, something had changed last night and that though until now she was completely safe���..after today����.but he was speaking �of course you don&#8217;t, not yet anyway, well I&#8217;ll tell you who Cherry is and you can tell me if you are her or not; 
Cherry is quite simply a slave girl she is not educated, has never gone out of her Master&#8217;s house and does not expect anything. She works hard all day and night to please her Master sleeps when she is allowed to, eats what she is ordered to and is extremely grateful for being allowed to live. Cherry lives where her Master wishes; chained outside his house, in the kennel with his pets or in a cage in his basement. Cherry is punished almost every day and she never bothers to ask why she is being punished, if punishing her amuses Master then cherry is ready to be beaten.
Cherry can be a whore or a servant a pony girl or a table; cherry in fact can be whatever her Master wishes. Cherry is very beautiful and quite unaware of it, you see Cherry doesn&#8217;t know what beauty is, she only know she must look a certain way to please her Master and so she does. Cherry keeps herself clean when her Master wishes and plays in the mud with pigs for his amusement.&nbsp; Cherry doesn&#8217;t think of herself as a woman or even as human, she believes she is Master&#8217;s toy created by him for his amusement and when she ceases to amuse Cherry is quite ready to be destroyed by her Master like toys are. 
Cherry feels discomfort but never complains; indeed the only words Cherry ever speaks are �Yes Master�. Most people think that Cherry is dumb but she is allowed to keep her voice so she can bark and moo as her Master wishes. Cherry doesn&#8217;t know what money or belongings are, she has never owned anything in her life so she is profoundly grateful for the chains and collar and rags her master provides. Cherry worships her master, whoever her master may be, you see Cherry didn&#8217;t know who her master would be, and she didn&#8217;t even know if she would have a Master or a Mistress, she just knew that it was her job to serve.� he stopped talking and stared at her. 
Looking at her intently not saying anything more, she had sunk down to the floor as he spoke, unable to believe, unable to comprehend what he was asking. He stood, towering over her, looking down at the crouched defeated woman before him, he knew she would accept; the one&#8217;s he picked always did. She was crying now her hands covered her face as she sobbed he pulled out a card with a number printed across it �if you are cherry call this number and give your name, you&#8217;ll get your instructions then� she didn&#8217;t pick it up, it was still lying on the carpet when he walked out of the door.
She flinched when she heard the door shut after him, remaining on the floor, the card and the numbers staring up at her. No she said aloud shaking her head, I can&#8217;t��I can&#8217;t give up my life, I am not a slave, this has gone far enough already. No more. No more games, no more black roses she screamed getting up in a rush. This is my life!!!! She cried out looking around the bare functional apartment��.Mr. Thomas she gasped he took away Mr. Thomas and a voice in her head replied �cherry doesn&#8217;t own anything�. I am not cherry she screamed. Tearing off the flimsy summer dress and putting on a full sleeved high collared skirt and blouse. But the cuts on her breast were still there, a remainder of what had happened of the choice she had made.&nbsp; His words came to her as sudden and as unexpected as his visits had been, one day she found herself sleeping naked on the floor by her bed wondering what it would be like to be cherry. She was no longer interested in her work, it seemed tedious, tiring and very complicated and she thought of uneducated cherry only doing manual labor. His words and the number lingered over and over in her mind, in her dreams and a question constantly remained would it be so bad? So terrible really to give up her pathetic life��she hunted out the card one day�.what would happen if she dialed? What would they tell her to do? And what if wanted to back out? Cherry doesn&#8217;t know she whispered, cherry just follows orders, cherry doesn&#8217;t care about consequences or right and wrong��.it must be wonderful to be cherry. To never make any decisions, to not have to bother about anything. She found herself looking at the card more and more. She needed to talk to him she decided touching the name on her breast, the marks still distinct and red, would he answer if she called the number and a voice in her head said cherry doesn&#8217;t know who her master or mistress will be cherry only serves. A mistress!!!!! She thought a flush creeping up her cheeks, she giggled nervously as she thought of kneeling humbly before a woman. Should she? Was she cherry? He seemed to think she was, fingers traced the number on the card. Yes perhaps she was cherry. She looked around her apartment again, what would I really be giving up? She thought, �a job I don&#8217;t care about, a small amount of comfort and a lifetime of boredom. Does it really matter if I live or turn into Cherry?� she looked around the apartment again, it was almost exactly like it had been when she rented it. �have I really lived here? Or was it just cherry waiting for a master?� she knelt on the floor, no longer ashamed or upset. She was cherry, He knew it and so did she. She just took longer to understand because she was�well a stupid slave. 
She picked up the phone her hands cold and sweaty with nerves. It&#8217;s okay she told herself this is the last decision you make, then�..then cherry will be free, she smiled as she dialed. It rang for a long time before it was picked up and a cool impersonal feminine voice answered �Global Sourcing, how may I help you?�, cherry hesitated wondering if it was the right number �this is cherry� she said her voice unsure and hesitant �I was told to call here� �and who told you to do that?� the voice asked more commanding now �Damien� she whispered touching the name. �very good cherry, now recite the address of wherever you are staying� the voice said in a patronizing tone, cherry&#8217;s voice on the other hand became more unsure, stumbling and stuttering, mis pronouncing words as she recited her address. �Good cherry� the voice said after she had finished �now don&#8217;t worry from now on we take over, you don&#8217;t have to make any more decisions just follow orders and you&#8217;ll be fine� �thank you� cherry said and the phone was disconnected. Cherry stared at the line for a minute what was she supposed to do now? She replaced the phone, that lady�.she spoke to me like�.like I was a child or a dog�.�but that is exactly what I am� cherry answered. �she was so kind making sure I would understand what she said�.
Cherry pottered around the apartment for&nbsp; the rest of the morning, she was just wondering if she should eat lunch when the door bell rang, her hand flew to her breast touching the letters as she ran to answer the door. A slender suited man carrying a briefcase and a laptop stood outside her door. She looked at him uncertainly wondering who he was, he raised his brows rather superciliously �after you open the door cherry, stand aside so the other person can walk in� he said in a kind voice. She stood aside immediately �shut the door cherry� he said �and stand here� he pointed at a spot, she stood obediently. He looked at her, his eyes moving all over her body, he took a notebook from his briefcase and started to make notes in it. He loosened her hair checking it&#8217;s length and color, he peered into her eyes with a torchlight, pinched her cheeks, slapped her face a few times not hard but enough to redden her cheeks, checked her teeth, then unbuttoned her blouse frowning in impatience when he saw a bra. Then he stepped back �strip cherry it&#8217;ll be much quicker that way�. She had remained still all through his examination now she went stiffer looking at him uncertainly �strip means to take off all your clothes cherry� the man said slowly pronouncing each word as if she didn&#8217;t understand English. He expects me to just strip cherry thought he can&#8217;t imagine that I would question his order, remembering the words cherry ever said she said �yes Master� and started to strip. He watched her with a rather bored expression waiting until she was fully naked then stood up. �hmmm� he mumbled �not very pretty cherry, we need to some work here. He held her breast in her hand stroking the nipple until it was hard and she had started to moan �quiet cherry, not now� he said tapping her with the end of his pen as he made notes in his book. He then measured her body noting down everything. �now cherry when I whistle you will start to jump� he said pulling out a stop clock and a whistle �this is a whistle� he said holding it up and she nodded �and when I clap my hands� he clapped once �you will stop. Do you understand?� he asked speaking slowly and clearly. �yes master� cherry repeated. 
She was no longer afraid or nervous, in fact she was extremely aroused by everything that was happening. Her body had become so much more sensitive, the cool breeze across her naked body was enough to make her nipples hard, she could feel goose bumps across her skin and she LOVED the way this man was treating her. He didn&#8217;t expect her to know anything, she didn&#8217;t have to think at all. Then she heard the sound of the whistle and she knew she must jump, it was that simple. She started to jump up and down her breasts bouncing, body quivering and all the while the man stared at her and his stop watch noting the time when she started to sweat and pant. He let her jump for almost 20 minutes before clapping and she stopped. �good girl� he said distractedly making more notes. �now� he said looking straight at her �this is your last chance. Are you sure you want to go ahead?� 
She was taken aback by his question, she blinked in confusion what should she say, then her face cleared �yes master� cherry answered simply. �good girl� he said again smiling �sit cherry� he pointed to his feet and she sat there on her hands and knees. He patted her head as he looked through her purse, he worked on his laptop doing a background check on her. �if you are bored cherry you can play with my shoes� he mumbled and continued working. A few times he asked her for her banking id and password or her mail accounts and passwords each time she answered immediately. He worked for a few hours taking notes, figuring every detail of her life while she licked and kissed his shoes nibbling them sometimes, moving her tongue all over them. He smiled as he glanced down at her �she certainly was talented, Damien always picked the best slaves, the firm could sell this one for a very high price. Pity she wasn&#8217;t younger though� he shrugged and got back to his work. 
After he had finished he glanced at the clock �well past lunchtime� he thought shrugging he went through her purse taking her credit cards. �now cherry, pay attention� she stopped licking at once and kneeled looking at him intently. �tomorrow you will give the notice to quit your job, if anyone asks tell them you are going on a long holiday. You will serve out your notice period as usual. But from now on you will not access any of your accounts. I will give you a daily allowance and you will manage in that. You will also put tell your landlord that you wish to leave the apartment at the end of the month. If he asks anything say that you are going on a long holiday.
