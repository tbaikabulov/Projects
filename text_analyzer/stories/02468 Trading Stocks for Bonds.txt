          Trading Stocks for Bonds - how Linsey was collared 
          (Complete Short Story) 
          by Aurelius 
         
         
      Her teacup chinked against its saucer. Not once, but five or six times
        in quick rattling succession. She was trembling and couldn&#146;t hide
        it. 
      &#147;I can pay you back,&#148; Linsey Altmell pleaded passionately. &#147;You
        know I can net that amount in just one year. I did it in 2002!&#148; 
      Apart from a security man blocking the door there was only one other
        person in the plush office at 6:30pm on a Friday evening. Ranulph Markham,
        her boss and chairman of Markham Brandham Stockbrokers sat on the other
        side of the large teak desk.  
      He frowned to indicate he did not share her optimism. &#147;Miss Altmell,
        we&#146;re talking about eight million pounds! Perhaps there is more
        we haven&#146;t uncovered yet. You are not in Nick Leeson&#146;s league,
        and this company certainly won&#146;t be going the way of Baring Brothers,
        but you have nevertheless wiped out almost one percent of my personal
        net worth. Miss Altmell, a schoolchild could have handled these accounts
        better than you did, although perhaps not as deviously.&#148; 
      Linsey gave up trying to drink her tea. The clattering of her cup and
        saucer only served to incriminate her further. She placed them carefully
        on the table and moved her trembling hands onto her lap.  
      Their eyes met. His, a sixty-five year old glazy blue, slightly baggy
        and wrinkled beneath; hers a vivid penetrating hazel, glistening with
        the beauty of youth. She was hardly the most beautiful woman he&#146;d
        ever seen, but he thought her more attractive than most - a pleasant
        face, long brown hair, a slim body; and she knew how to dress well, an
        increasingly rare thing in the modern age. For her part, Linsey had always
        thought Markham rather good-looking in spite of his advancing years. 
      It had been hectic week on the markets and Markham was tired of talking
        prices and profits. He valued his weekends, putting aside financial matters
        to concentrate on his true passions. Closing up the file containing Linsey
        Altmell&#146;s catalogue of disastrous deals he declared to himself that
        the weekend had just started. 
      &#147;Am I fired?&#148; Linsey asked, perplexed at why Markham couldn&#146;t
        just come out and say it. 
      &#147;No. I&#146;m not firing you. That would be too easy,&#148; he
        replied. 
      She squirmed awkwardly in her seat and ventured another question: &#147;So
        are you going to call the police?&#148; 
      He shrugged his shoulders. &#147;Why bother? You might go to jail for
        a couple of years. Then you are released, you write a book and sell the
        film rights. Meanwhile I&#146;m still eight million down. I might have
        to close one of my charitable foundations.&#148; 
      &#147;So, you&#146;re going to keep me on?&#148; She asked, smiling,
        but a little surprised. 
      &#147;Yes I am... after a fashion. You are an attractive young woman,
        with a pretty face and a nice body. Miss Altmell, I intend to have you.&#148; 
      She became wide-eyed with shock and gave a nervous laugh, unintentionally
        mocking him. Her boss might be a rich and powerful man but she always
        regarded him as a gentleman not a sexual predator. This didn&#146;t suit
        the mild-mannered chairman at all. 
      &#147;This is a joke, right? It&#146;s ridiculous! You&#146;re trying
        to blackmail me, and I have a witness to that effect,&#148; she glanced
        at the impassive security guard by the door then looked Markham squarely
        in the eyes. &#147;You... can&#146;t... have... me,&#148; she snarled, &#147;I
        resign!&#148; 
      Her witness was Cormack, Head of Security at Markham Brandham. After
        two years with the firm Linsey still didn&#146;t know if it was his first
        or last name. Like &#145;Cher&#146; he used to joke, as only a man 6&#146;5&#148; tall
        and built like a prop forward can. He was good looking, helpful and sociable,
        liked by everybody including Linsey, but everyone knew him to be fiercely
        loyal to his employer. He did not return Linsey&#146;s glance. Instead
        he looked at his boss, ready to carry out any instruction. 
      &#147;You misunderstand me Miss Altmell.&#148; Markham said, appearing
        not to take offence from her comment, or the implicit ageism. &#147;I
        didn&#146;t mean to suggest anything as crude as bedding you. I&#146;m
        well catered for in that respect already. What I meant was to have
        you, in the sense of owning you. Owning your body permanently.&#148; 
      Linsey was stunned into silence for several seconds. &#147;This is sick.&#148; She
        said, rising from her chair. Cormack immediately moved towards her. 
      &#147;Sit!&#148; Ranulph Markham barked. Linsey recoiled at the surprising
        ferocity of Markham&#146;s command. She sat down again whilst Cormack
        backed up to his position by the door. &#147;I haven&#146;t explained
        what I intend to do to you yet.&#148; 
      Linsey prided herself on her cool composure but it was being severely
        tested. Feeling her mouth drying up she reached again for her teacup.
        This time she left the saucer on the table, but it still rattled as she
        lifted the cup. It needed both her shaky hands to raise the cup to her
        lips. Markham bided his time. He enjoyed watching her discomfort as she
        sipped repeatedly, hoping perhaps that the cup contained something a
        good deal stronger than tea. 
      She put the cup down decisively, as if strengthened by the tea. It had
        to be a sick joke, she thought. You can&#146;t turn an employee into
        a sex slave. Not even if she&#146;s lost your company eight million pounds.
        Not in London in the twenty-first century! She realized she was taking
        this game far too seriously. It was time to humour him. 
      &#147;Okay Sir.&#148; She sat up straight and ground her buttocks into
        the seat with a little wiggle as she tried to regain her poise. &#147;Then
        please explain what are you planning to do to me.&#148; 
      Markham was happy to oblige. In fact he had been waiting for this moment.
        He spoke slowly and deliberately in his gravelly tones so that Linsey
        could absorb every word. 
      &#147;First of all, you will remove all your clothes. You can do it
        by yourself or with Cormack&#146;s assistance, I really don&#146;t mind.
        Your jewelry too, you won&#146;t need it anymore. I&#146;ll donate the
        proceeds to one of my charities.&#148; 
      Linsey instinctively reached up to touch the expensive gold chain that
        lay gleaming against her tanned skin; tantalisingly visible between the
        two-button opening of her blouse. 
      &#147;When you are completely naked Cormack will bind you. The rope
        we use is soft, but there will be lots of it and it will be very tight.
        We need to fit you into the suitcase behind you.&#148; 
      Linsey swiveled around to see the suitcase she&#146;d barely registered
        before. It would be difficult to fit somebody into it, but not impossible.
        She turned back to face him. 
      &#147;You&#146;ll be gagged of course. We will pack your mouth with
        a silk scarf then tape it over several times.&#148; He looked up at Cormack
        for confirmation of this. Cormack nodded. 
      &#147;And hooded too. A black cloth bag with a drawstring pulled tightly
        around your neck.&#148; 
      She swallowed her saliva nervously. Markham noted and enjoyed that first
        nervous gulp.  
      &#147;When you are locked in the suitcase we&#146;ll leave. You&#146;ll
        be traveling in style, in the boot of my Rolls-Royce. Ever been in a
        Rolls-Royce before Miss Altmell?&#148; 
      She shook her head and gulped again. 
      &#147;They&#146;re beautiful machines, automotive works of art. It&#146;s
        like floating on air. They have such a smooth ride, as you&#146;ll discover
        for yourself very soon. Where was I? Oh yes, I remember...  
      &#147;Immediately upon arrival at my country estate your training will
        commence. Neither Cormack or I will be involved. I have excellent people
        to do that sort of thing. Did I ever mention that to you before? No?&#148; He
        made it sound like an oversight, the forgetfulness of an old man. &#147;It&#146;s
        not only stock-exchange traders I employ. I also have people who specialise
        in turning a sophisticated woman - as you pretend to be - into a shameless
        whore, which is what you will become. Sometimes, Miss Altmell, to build
        something worthwhile one must to destroy what was there before.&#148; 
      Single tears tumbled down each of Linsey&#146;s cheeks in perfect sync.
        She didn&#146;t believe him but it was scaring her nonetheless. She pleaded
        with him. &#147;Mr. Markham Sir, you can&#146;t do this. John, my boyfriend,
        is calling to collect me in twenty minutes. He&#146;ll know something&#146;s
        wrong if I&#146;m not waiting outside for him. Please stop this awful
        game right now.&#148; Buoyed up by the certainty of John&#146;s arrival
        she rose to her feet and walked hastily towards the door. She stood facing
        the barrel chest of an immovable object. 
      &#147;Let me pass Cormack!&#148; She demanded, looking up to him more
        in hope than expectation. Cormack gripped her by the upper arm, spun
        her around and pushed her down into her chair. He yanked her arms back
        through the vertical wooden slats of the chair&#146;s backrest and pulled
        the handcuffs from their holster on his belt. He ratcheted the cuffs
        onto her wrists, effectively locking her to the chair. 
      &#147;I assume you finished your tea?&#148; Markham joked meanly, noticing
        Linsey looking forlornly into the teacup. &#147;Ever worn handcuffs before
        Ms Altmell?&#148; 
      Linsey shook her head sullenly. 
      &#147;These ones are very comfortable don&#146;t you think, they don&#146;t
        dig into you flesh like other types, much more suitable for long term
        use on a woman&#146;s soft skin and slender wrists. I like them so much
        I bought shares in the company.&#148; 
      Even though he was facing her from across the table Markham could tell
        that Linsey&#146;s wrists were tugging and twisting within their unaccustomed
        confinement. &#147;Does that feel nice, Ms Altmell? Some women like it.
        Their powerlessness turns them on. They like being controlled, submitting
        themselves to another, and being done to. It frees them from guilt. Just
        imagine the exquisite torment when you want to masturbate, but you can&#146;t
        because your hands are secured behind you. Many women have their most
        intense orgasms when they are tied or secured. Perhaps you will be like
        that too?&#148;  
      "No," Linsey mouthed softly, and without conviction. She ceased her
        struggling, sat up straight, composed herself and looked across to Markham.
        Just because she was handcuffed it didn&#146;t mean she need lose her
        dignity. 
      &#147;That&#146;s a nice outfit you&#146;re wearing, Miss Altmell.&#148; Markham
        commented casually. &#147;Medium grey pin-striped jacket and matching
        skirt. Very nice tailoring. Bespoke I presume?&#148; 
      Linsey nodded warily, wondering where that line of questioning was heading. 
      &#147;You have good taste. I do so prefer a suit with a tailored fit.
        Quality is always worth the price. Cars, clothes&#133; slaves.&#148; He
        looked at her chest, noticing the anxious rise and fall of her breasts. &#147;That
        blouse goes perfectly with your jacket. Burgundy, I would call that.&#148; 
      "Yes, Sir," Linsey reluctantly confirmed. It was indeed burgundy, and
        this particular blouse was one of her favourites, a Donna Karan. 
      &#147;You&#146;ve worn the suit and the blouse before, haven&#146;t
        you?&#148; He looked down at his typed-up notes. &#147;March 21st, it
        says here.&#148; 
      She was taken aback by the mention of such a seemingly irrelevant detail. &#147;What&#146;s
        that got to do with anything?&#148; She asked with genuine curiosity. 
      &#147;You&#146;ll find out later. First allow me to continue explaining
        what will happen to you. I assume you are interested in what your future
        holds?&#148; 
      Linsey glared back at him, trying to maintain her dignity by sitting
        bolt upright in her chair, aided ironically by her cuffed wrists trapped
        the chair back. 
      Markham continued. &#147;When you reach my estate you will be unpacked
        from the suitcase, untied, and your naked body will be paraded in front
        of some specially invited guests. You will be chained to one of the oak
        pillars in my library and will be whipped. It will hurt, perhaps more
        painful than anything you&#146;ve ever known. Yet it will only be a taste
        of what will follow. Then you&#146;ll be left hanging in your restraints
        while I provide dinner for my guests... 
      &#147;I&#146;m sure Miss Altmell you will look exquisitely beautiful,
        your whip-marked naked body standing chained against a pillar whilst
        my guests enjoy a sumptuous meal just a few yards away from you... 
      &#147;You, Miss Altmell, will be the dessert course. My guests will
        give you a thorough and extremely intimate examination... 
      &#147;You will be fitted with a thick leather collar in keeping with
        your new status as an untrained whore. Then you will be chained in your
        cell for the night. You&#146;ll have to get used to that Miss Altmell,
        you&#146;ll sleep in chains every night from now on... 
      &#147;The following morning you will start your bitch-dog training.
        Have you ever had sex with a dog, Miss Altmell?&#148; 
      She shook her head, unable to muster a response to such a ridiculous
        question. 
      &#147;Every morning you&#146;ll be taken to the back lawn of my mansion
        to be attached to our breeding frame. It&#146;s the stump of a tree equipped
        with leather restraints. It will hold you completely immobile and render
        your whore&#146;s cunt easily accessible to my dogs. When they are let
        out of their kennels in the morning they always run to see if anyone
        has been secured to the breeding frame. They&#146;ll probably fight over
        you, but don&#146;t worry - they are muzzled. They can&#146;t bite you
        but their claws will scratch your back. After the dogs have had you,
        you will be left secured to the breeding frame for at least an hour so
        that you can fully appreciate your new status. Then your rump will be
        soundly beaten with a paddle before you are released and taken back into
        the house... 
      &#147;Every afternoon you will be taught how to serve men and women,
        and how to behave in the presence of your superiors. Superiors means
        everybody, including the garden labourers. You will learn how to take
        a man&#146;s cock fully within your throat and how to accommodate him
        in your rectum as if it&#146;s no different to the missionary position&#133; 
      &#147;You will be whipped if you are bad, You will be whipped if you
        are good. You will learn to respond to the whip. In due course, the very
        sight of a whip in a man&#146;s hand will arouse you... 
      &#147;A tattoo artist will begin etching an elaborate design on your
        skin, which will weave its way up and down the length of your body from
        ankles to neck. It will be beautiful, and will mark you out as a lifelong
        slave. You will be pierced and branded in any manner we see fit.&#148; 
      Linsey had closed her eyes, but could not close her ears to Markham&#146;s
        monologue. Her mind was reeling, overwhelmed with the images he described.
        The cool steel encircling her wrists seemed to reinforce everything he
        was saying. 
      Markham continued relentlessly, like a boxer finishing off his opponent. &#147;You
        will experience extreme forms of bondage, sometimes you&#146;ll be suspended
        or stretched, contorted or compressed. You will attend elegant parties,
        where your body will be exhibited in ways more obscene than you can possibly
        imagine... 
      &#147;Occasionally you will be permitted the release of an orgasm, but
        always under the strict control of one of your handlers, or perhaps as
        part of a public performance... 
      &#147;When, after three months your training is complete I will decide
        whether to keep you or sell you. I am a member of an exclusive club that
        owns a small island in the pacific. Perhaps I will send you there to
        be trained as a ponygirl. You might enjoy that Miss Altmell, being harnessed
        in an array of leather straps, a bit wedged between your teeth, every
        day spent trotting around the island with a whip being applied to your
        buttocks. 
      &#147;There is a market for young attractive women like you. A market
        bigger than you can possibly imagine. You are a valuable commodity, or
        at least you will be when you are a fully-trained bonded whore.&#148; 
      Linsey was still immaculately dressed in her burgundy and grey, but
        her clothes no longer seemed to fit. The jacket that always felt so comfortable
        now seemed too tight and too warm, and she even wondered if it really
        suited her as well as she always supposed. 
      She was biting down on her bottom lip, her eyes darting nervously about
        the room. Loose strands of hair, which she habitually tucked behind her
        ears with her fingers, now hung untidily at the side of her face. She
        flicked her head back in a wild gesture that only messed her hair up
        even more. Inside she was a mess too. Markham&#146;s speech had scared
        her. It was like the strange churned up feeling she had in her belly
        when she fell in love, but this was far more intense, almost painful. 
      Markham paused to observe his latest acquisition and saw that Linsey&#146;s
        subtly made-up eyes were closed, her cheeks flushed, her breathing rapid,
        as if fighting a mental battle. 
      &#147;Oh Lord, look at the time!&#148; Markham exclaimed, breaking the
        silence and causing Linsey to open her eyes. &#147;Your boyfriend will
        be here in fifteen minutes. We&#146;d better get you undressed and ready.
        You won&#146;t need clothes any more. What&#146;s it to be? With or without
        Cormack&#146;s assistance?&#148; 
      &#147;Without,&#148; Linsey replied automatically, though being undressed
        by the handsome hunk Cormack would not have seemed such a terrible prospect
        until this evening. 
      Cormack unlocked her cuffs. She rubbed her wrists, more in imitation
        of scenes in television and movies than from any actual pain. She glanced
        warily at both men, and began hesitantly undressing under Cormack&#146;s
        intimidating gaze.  
      She folded and laid her jacket, skirt and blouse carefully on the table
        and stood self-conscious and vulnerable in her underwear, unable to shield
        her body from view, and unwilling to flaunt it.  
      Her undergarments, - bra, panties, matching garter-belt and stockings
        - were burgundy, just like her blouse. Attention to detail! Markham liked
        that. The men nodded to each other in approval. They often talked of
        how so few women make the effort these days. Cormack was equally taken
        with Linsey&#146;s gym-toned body, neither skinny nor muscular nor too
        fleshy. Her three-inch heels, strappy and open-topped, gave her posture
        that all-important lift. Stockings absolutely had to be accompanied by
        heels in Markham&#146;s opinion. 
      Linsey pleaded to Cormack with her eyes, hoping that being stripped
        down to her underwear would suffice. It was futile, Cormack gestured
        that she should continue undressing. He doubted Linsey&#146;s nakedness
        could improve on her lingerie-caressed body, but somehow it did. 
      Markham, meanwhile, stared impassively out of his tenth floor window.
        Was his indifference designed to insult her further, Linsey wondered? &#147;Earrings,
        bracelets, necklace, watch and rings,&#148; he reminded her without bothering
        to turn around. 
      She fought back her sobs as she removed her jewelry placing each item
        carefully on top of her folded clothes, as if she expected to be dressing
        again. She&#146;d almost forgotten her earrings until Cormack reminded
        her. She removed them, replacing the fastenings on each before adding
        them to the rest of her garments.  
      Linsey stood head bowed and naked in front of two fully clothed men,
        stripped not just of her clothing, but her identity, her status, and
        her will to resist. Neatly folded and piled on the table was the sum
        of everthing she enjoyed, held precious, and strived for.  
      On top of the pile were the high-heeled sandals placed side by side,
        receiving the attention of all three of the room&#146;s occupants. Markham&#146;s
        philosophy was that the delicated straps which caressed the arch of the
        feet and wrapped around the ankle were subtle yet powerful symbols of
        bondage. High heels, to him, represented a woman&#146;s willingness to
        conform to a man&#146;s ideal. He consulted his clipboard and the photo
        of Linsey leaving the building on March 21st. The shoes in the picture
        were very different. He showed the picture to Cormack. 
      &#147;We already have the shoes we need,&#148; Cormack confirmed, &#147;we
        don&#146;t need those.&#148; 
      Markham laughed at how Cormack and his team always had things covered. &#147;Put
        the shoes on,&#148; he commanded Linsey.  
      She sat down, her naked buttocks sticking to the leather cushioned seat.
        She placed the sandals on the floor and fastened them onto her bare feet
        buckling the straps around her slim ankles. It was an awful feeling -
        these Jimmy Choo&#146;s always made her feel so sexy, yet now, parading
        naked in front of these two men it was the last thing she wanted to feel. 
      &#147;Tie her wrists, Cormack, then take out the clothes,&#148; Markham
        instructed before returning to his view out of the window. Cormack opened
        the suitcase containing the rope and the gagging tape they mentioned
        earlier. 
      &#147;No. Please don&#146;t.&#148; Linsey&#146;s quivering voice pleaded
        as Cormack approached her, a length of thick white rope gripped in his
        hand. 
      &#147;Do as Cormack says or he&#146;ll hit you. Then he&#146;ll tie
        you up anyway.&#148; Markham advised.  
      The combined advice and threat made Linsey shiver. She remembered an
        awful incident in the ground floor lobby one day when one of Cormack&#146;s
        punches split open a man&#146;s nose. She had no choice but to turn her
        back to him, cross her wrists behind her and let him tie them. 
      After making six neat loops and giving a couple of decisive tugs Cormack
        was done. Such was the efficacy of his binding technique Linsey felt
        like her wrists had been at once tied, glued and riveted together. She
        looked forlornly over her shoulder at her joined wrists, bending back
        her fingers in the vain hope she could reach the knots. It was hopeless.  
      Markham approved. Linsey was looking better already. He always felt
        a naked woman looked so much tidier when her hands are neatly held behind
        her back. 
      &#147;Clamps?&#148; Cormack suggested to his boss, already reaching
        into the suitcase. Markham looked quickly at Linsey&#146;s neat shapely
        breasts, her nipples small yet prominent, and slightly upturned. He nodded
        his agreement. 
      With Cormack standing behind her, Linsey didn&#146;t seen the clamps
        approaching. She screamed at the sudden shock, like a dog having its
        tail stepped on. Embraced in Cormack&#146;s bear hug she was powerless
        to resist as her other nipple was clamped. An arc of chain was left dangling
        between them. His job done, Cormack picked up Linsey&#146;s orderly pile
        of clothing and jewelry and walked out of the room, locking the door
        behind him. 
      This girl had never worn nipple clamps before, Markham suspected, as
        Linsey hopped around the room, squealing, squirming and swearing. The
        pain of the clamps made her forget her nakedness and bondage. Never before
        bound or nipple-clamped, he surmised. He reckoned he had enough experience
        to be a good judge of such things. 
      Linsey was desperate to stop the pain in her tortured nipples. She knelt
        down on the carpet and tried to dislodge the nipple clamps with the edge
        of Markham's antique desk. At first Markham laughed as the steel clamps
        rattled against the polished teak, then he saw the damage she was doing. 
      &#147;Stop that, Miss Altmell!&#148; He commanded. Linsey obeyed, feeling
        guilty about vandalizing an expensive piece of furniture. She stood up
        and prowled the room, tugging on her tied wrists and shaking her breasts
        in the vain hope of dislodging the nipple clamps. It looked like she
        was wrestling with an invisible opponent, Markham mused. He never doubted
        that Cormack&#146;s rope-work was secure, so he left her to pace around
        the boardroom like a caged tigress, while he kept an eye on the street
        below. 
      Even though Linsey heard the door locking when Cormack left, she went
        to the door and yanked on the handle in the vain hope that it might open.
        Naked or not, she was prepared to run at the first opportunity. Markham
        didn&#146;t turn around to look at her, not even as she cursed and rattled
        the handle several more times. 
      Then she noticed a phone on a low bookshelf and backed herself up to
        it, while Markham looked out of the window. She lifted the receiver off
        the hook with her bound hands and dialled what she hoped was 9112 for
        emergency services. 
      &#147;What do you want from me, Mr. Markham?&#148; she yelled out across
        the room. &#147;Please don&#146;t rape me, I&#146;m begging you!&#148; 
      Markham turned around, somewhat surprised at Linsey&#146;s outburst. &#147;I&#146;m
        not going to rape you, Miss Altmell, at least not tonight. I already
        told you, you&#146;re going to be a bonded whore. We&#146;ll be leaving
        Hitcham Tower within half an hour and driving to my estate in Hampshire!
        He tutted at how little attention she had paid to his previous speech.
        Such lapses of memory would be severely dealt with once her training
        commenced. 
      Linsey left the handset off the hook hoping that Markham would continue
        to incriminate himself to the emergency operators. She glanced at the
        four wall clocks: New York, two o&#146;clock, Frankfurt eight o&#146;clock,
        four in the morning in Tokyo, while here in London it was seven o&#146;clock
        exactly. John, her boyfriend said earlier he&#146;d collect her at seven
        on the dot. The thought of him pulling up outside at the same time as
        the police arrived made her tremble in delicious anticipation of victory. 
      The old man and his latest acquisition stood side-by-side, both staring
        out the window at the street below, both waiting and watching. Linsey&#146;s
        optimism was as great as the old man&#146;s smugness. Markham looked
        across at his latest acquisition and smiled. The combination of high
        heels and tied hands had given her an excellent posture. He tenderly
        pulled her hair back from her face, tucking it behind her ear just as
        she would have done if her hands were not tied. He wanted to see that
        slim neck again anticipating how exquisite it would be when locked in
        one of his collars. Linsey was a natural submissive and slave, he was
        increasingly sure of it, even if she wasn&#146;t. 
      A hundred feet below them, with his usual impeccable timing John pulled
        up in his silver BMW M3. Linsey whimpered his name calling quietly towards
        him as she saw the driver&#146;s door open. She knew from habit that
        John would go into reception to check with the desk supervisor. Then
        the supervisor would call her extension to say her boyfriend had arrived. 
      She could not have expected what happened a moment later when her nightmare
        went from bad to worse. John had barely stepped out of his car when a
        woman exited the building and approached him. He and the woman kissed
        briefly but affectionately, then they got in the car and drove off. Linsey
        watched in stunned disbelief as the BMW idled impatiently at a nearby
        red light. As the light changed to green the car turned right in a squealing,
        rubber-burning skid, attracting the disapproving glances of passers-by. 
      What really confused Linsey was that even with a distance of ten floors
        between them, the woman, especially with her long dark hair, looked remarkably
        similar to herself. She was an imposter, Linsey realized. 
      &#147;You see, Miss Altmell. He doesn&#146;t love you. He doesn&#146;t
        mind who gets in his car.&#148; Markham joked. 
      Linsey collapsed to the Wilton carpet in despair, kneeling on her calves,
        bent forward and sobbing wildly. &#147;He loves me,&#148; she sobbed &#147;I
        know he loves me!&#148; 
      Markham grinned, sensing that Linsey&#146;s transition was well under
        way. He stroked the top of her head, tidying her hair, and enjoying its
        silky softness. &#147;Come come now Miss Altmell, it&#146;s all over.
        What is it your generation is so fond of saying? Get over it! You should
        think of your new life now.&#148; 
      Cormack returned to the office. He immediately went to the phone and
        replaced the handset. Then he bent down and plugged its cable into the
        wall socket. 
      &#147;Everything okay?&#148; Markham asked him. 
      &#147;Perfect!&#148; Cormack replied, &#147;I told the team leader to
        call you.&#148; 
      Seconds later the phone rang. Cormack touched the hands-free button. 
      &#147;Sir?&#148; a voice enquired from the phone&#146;s speaker. 
      &#147;Go ahead. What&#146;s happening?&#148; Markham called out from
        across the room. 
      In measured tones, the voice gave his report. &#147;Everything has gone
        to plan Mr. Markham. The boyfriend has been drugged and won&#146;t wake
        until at least five a.m. We&#146;ve put traces of Ms Altmell&#146;s blood
        in the boot of his car with fibres from her most recent clothing. An
        Internet ticket to Thailand has been purchase using his credit card.
        The security recordings of Ms Altmell leaving the building on March 21st
        will be edited into today&#146;s security footage, ready for the morning
        archiving.&#148; 
      &#147;Excellent work, Harry. Have a great weekend!&#148; Markham shouted
        cheerily as the call ended. 
      Linsey heard it all, just as Markham intended she should. She was open-mouthed
        with shock. &#147;Oh my God... it wasn&#146;t John in the car. You&#146;re
        framing him for my murder!&#148; 
       &#147;That&#146;s right Miss Altmell. There will be witnesses who remember
        the car arriving and your getting into it. The burning rubber was a nice
        touch don&#146;t you think? It&#146;ll help cement the witnesses&#146; memories.
        Your boyfriend will have no alibi, and will fighting against strong circumstantial
        evidence. He&#146;ll be jailed for your murder, of that I am certain.&#148; 
      &#147;Why John? What&#146;s he done? I was the one who lost the damn
        money!&#148; Linsey said, choking back her tears. 
      Markham had waited patiently to deliver his coupe de grace. &#147;Miss
        Altmell. We all know that when somebody loses money on the markets, somebody,
        somewhere gains. John gave you insider tips, didn&#146;t he? But they
        kept going wrong, didn&#146;t they? While you were buying, he and his
        associates were selling. When you were off-loading shares at the bottom
        of the market, he and his customers were buying. He&#146;s been using
        you Linsey. Your relationship has been a fraud enabling him to put millions
        in his bank account. Now both of you shall be punished.&#148; 
      Linsey hung her head and started to sob. &#147;Bastard! Bastard! Bastard!&#148;  
      Markham smiled, delighted that she now hated someone else even more
        than him. She slumped from the chair onto the carpet, wanting to hide
        her humiliation. With her wayward hair covering her face, she almost
        succeeded. 
      &#147;Tie her up, Cormack.&#148; Ranulph Markham commanded imperiously. 
      Linsey, in her despair, was already hunched over on the floor in exactly
        the right position for Cormack to commence his work. He took the first
        rope, wrapped it several times above and below her breasts and cinched
        her elbows behind her. Markham took up a position standing directly in
        front of Linsey&#146;s kneeling body. She tried to look up to him but
        it seemed a long way up; it was easier to look at his immaculately creased
        trousers and highly polished shoes. 
      Cormack continued to apply his ropes, wrapping, tugging and knotting,
        with the unfaltering precision of a craftsman. Linsey&#146;s only protest
        was the occasional &#145;ouch&#146; as the ropes nipped at her flesh.
        Any thoughts of escape evaporated when Cormack started binding her ankles
        together, the ropes catching the instep of her high heels binding her
        shoes to her. 
      Cormack&#146;s fingers burrowed into the folds of her sex, but didn&#146;t
        linger. Moments later his hand returned with a small vibrator that he
        pushed deep inside her. A little wire with a switchbox trailed out of
        it, enabling him to turn the thing on or off when required. Then he continued
        fixing the ropes, winding one several times around her belly, then up
        between her legs to nestle deep within her crotch to hold the vibrator
        in place. 
      By the time Cormack had finished, Linsey had gone from tied to trussed;
        a tightly packaged ball, her breasts squeeezed against her thighs, and
        her bound ankles connected to her wrists. Rope bit into her flesh in
        all directions.  
      All Linsey could think about were Markham&#146;s words - chained to
        a pillar and whipped, her body explored by strangers, the collar, the
        breeding frame, the bondage, training to be a whore! 
      Cormack offered a neatly folded black silk scarf to her lips. Too tired
        to protest she opened her mouth to allow him to insert it, which he did
        with the same firm and impersonal touch that he applied in his rope-work.
        Then he plastered broad strips of white medical tape across her mouth
        - several four-inch wide strips on top of each other, masking the lower
        half of her face, and muffling her cries. 
      &#147;Good girl, Linsey.&#148; Markham commented, still standing dominantly
        about her. He knew how important it was to compliment new slaves on their
        good behaviour. &#147;Is she moist?&#148; he asked Cormack. 
      Cormack slipped a hand between her buttocks and tied feet, and fingered
        her rope-clefted sex. &#147;I&#146;d say so,&#148; he confirmed with
        a smile. &#147;Shouldn&#146;t we give her a little reward for being well
        behaved?&#148; 
      There was a faintly audible click, then rapid yet gentle vibrations
        started up deep within Linsey&#146;s vagina. She couldn&#146;t prevent
        herself from shivering and squirming in response to the mechanical invader.
        The men chuckled. 
      It was time for the hood - a black satin bag barely large enough to
        fit over her head. Cormack struggled to make it fit, tugging down on
        it until the opening was around her neck. He pulled the drawstring, knotting
        it tight enough for Linsey to feel a almost choking constriction around
        her neck. 
      Cormack&#146;s sturdy legs straddled Linsey&#146;s ball-tied body like
        a human crane. He squatted, slipped his hands under her knees and lifted
        her clean off the carpet. In the same movement he lowered her sideways
        into the suitcase. He noticed that Linsey was trembling. Was it fear
        or merely the effect of the vibrator? A little of each, he thought. 
      He closed the suitcase&#146;s lid, and zipped it up along three sides.
        The long zipping sound signalled to Linsey that her previous life, career-obsessed
        and materialistic, was ending. A new life of sexual slavery and liberation
        was about to begin. 
       
        
           * * * 
         
       
      Ranulph Markham was right. The Rolls-Royce did have a smooth ride. It
        was self-evident even if you happen to be tied up in the boot.  
      Several weeks later Linsey could confirm Ranulph Markham was right about
        everything else too. The breeding frame, the whippings, the training,
        the bondage, the torments and humiliations were exactly as he described
        on that fateful evening in his office. Now there was only one thing on
        the whore linsey&#146;s mind - whether Markham would keep her or sell
        her. She desperately hoped she could stay. 
       
        
           THE END
