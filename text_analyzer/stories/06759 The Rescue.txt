1The Rescue

by ariel emms (if you enjoy this story, please feel free to let me know)

Why didn&#8217;t this one stop talking and get on with it, she thought to herself.&nbsp; If it were over she could go back into her shell.&nbsp; She had hardly emerged now - she barely could anymore - and she wanted back in.

EMMS RUNNING FILE - DAY 1:

From: Manager of Acquisitions
To: Manager of Marketing

Bought this one at the latest auction - valuable acquisition, good price.&nbsp; I&#8217;ve always said it pays to talk to the merchandise beforehand.&nbsp; Unlike the usual consignment of unsatisfactory subs and over-used escorts, not the slightest idea what she&#8217;s gotten into - put herself in the auction!&nbsp; Says she was auctioned off once before and it was �kind of fun�.&nbsp; Seems to think this is some sort of lark.&nbsp; Our client Samson as a possibility?
________

She managed to surface enough to take in that this client, the talkative one, was female.&nbsp; She had liked the female clients at first - they were mostly nicer than the men - but she had to do things to them to satisfy them, and she hadn&#8217;t the energy any more.&nbsp; With the men she could just let them do what they wanted - at least, with the men they&#8217;d given her to lately.&nbsp; She hardly needed to come out of her shell at all with them.&nbsp; Mostly they were in groups of three or four, someplace she was taken to, and she could just lie there, she didn&#8217;t have to do anything, just wipe their cum from her face and chest and belly afterwards, if she had the energy.&nbsp; Sometimes she did.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Thought you might like an update on the Emms purchase.&nbsp; I thought of Samson too as soon as I saw her - he likes them small.&nbsp; Arranged it for yesterday, with standard first-event surveillance, but Samson was in to the office today to discuss it, and his version of events is essentially confirmed.&nbsp; Emms seemed to think she had some say in the matter - she refused to remove her clothes, though apparently she took some off eventually, and seemed quite surprised when he tore off the rest.&nbsp; From there I gather it was one frightened refusal after another till he finally picked her up and held her flat on the table.&nbsp; He says she began screaming in terror at that point, though on the videos it looked and sounded more like pain once he entered her - we haven&#8217;t codenamed him Samson for nothing, after all.&nbsp;&nbsp; As I said, he was in to see me the next day - said it was exactly what he&#8217;d been looking for, wants to buy her.&nbsp; I&#8217;ve declined for the moment, since there&#8217;s probably more money in keeping her.&nbsp; He&#8217;s booked her again for tomorrow.
________

She hadn&#8217;t had a female in...in a while.&nbsp; It was hard to form that thought, since it forced her to separate one day from all the others, something she hadn&#8217;t done in a long time.&nbsp; Thinking that hard pulled her a little further out of her shell, enough to realise that this female was wearing clothes.&nbsp; That usually meant something, she managed to recall.&nbsp; Instinctively, she shuffled from her corner, where she was huddled naked, and spread herself across the rack, ready for the whip to strike.

Still talking - no one talked to her now, no one had talked to her for a long time.&nbsp; She had almost forgotten how to talk.&nbsp; Things got said about her - good little slut - or sometimes at her - suck it bitch - but never anything where she mattered.&nbsp; That was why she was almost gone, why she lived inside her shell.

EMMS RUNNING FILE - DAY 5:

From: Manager of Marketing
To: Head Manager

There was a bit of a mistake on the Emms lot - I&#8217;d rather you hear it from me first.&nbsp; Emms is a new acquisition, just her second use yesterday.&nbsp; The client had arranged that she be tied on her back, spread-eagled, head tied off the edge.&nbsp; Pretty standard stuff, and I presume he did use her mouth, but apparently at some point he decided to take her anally as well.&nbsp; With this calibre of client we&#8217;d just throw that in as part of the package, of course.&nbsp; This acquisition was a little out of the ordinary, though, and it seems pretty likely from her after-the-fact behaviour that this must have been her first time being sodomized - at a minimum, we certainly could have marketed her on that basis.&nbsp; Realistically we could have gotten double the usual rate or more, had I thought of it.&nbsp; It&#8217;s such a rare situation that it just didn&#8217;t cross my mind.&nbsp; Lesson learned for the future, I suppose.
________

She had tried for a while to fight her shell, tried to keep her mind active. She had tried counting out loud, saying times tables, just to keep talking, but soon decided that she sounded insane, the crazy girl in the cell talking nonsense.&nbsp; Talking became worse than not talking&nbsp; Then she had tried doing little rhymes in her head - talk, walk, chalk, rock - but they had always turned bad - sock, suck, fuck - and thinking became worse than not thinking.&nbsp; It had become easier to give up on it.

Finally the woman grabbed her - at last this would be over with soon.&nbsp; The woman grabbed her shoulder, though, and pulled her up.&nbsp; She had leaned close and there were...what was that word again?...tears, that was it, there were tears in her eyes.&nbsp; Then the woman paused from talking long enough to kiss her on the cheek, to hug her, and in that silence she realised that she knew one of the words the woman had used: �...........ayla.......�

EMMS RUNNING FILE - DAY 8:

From: Mistress of Physical Assets 
To: Manager of Marketing

In response to your query, my assessment is that Emms is not yet ready to return to penetrative services - oral, perhaps, but apart from that we&#8217;d risk long-term physical damage, which would be bad for our investment.&nbsp; We&#8217;ve nearly broken her spirit, but we need to be careful not to break her completely if she&#8217;s to have any value to us.&nbsp; Might I suggest that you place her with some female clients for the moment?&nbsp; I don&#8217;t like my girls to get hurt, but on the other hand we can&#8217;t have her go to waste in the short term either.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
________

She began to listen then - she couldn&#8217;t really remember what �ayla� meant, but she knew that hearing it made her...there was a word for this feeling - yes! - it made her happy to hear it, that was the word.&nbsp; Happy - she&#8217;d forgotten about that.&nbsp; Then she made out another word - �ariel�.&nbsp; She couldn&#8217;t remember what that meant, but she was sure she&#8217;d heard it before.&nbsp; 

The woman thrust clothes at her, talking again, and she managed to put them on.&nbsp; Clothes - it had been so long - a memory surfaced, she, she liked clothes - no, not quite that, but she, she, there was some word she couldn&#8217;t remember, something about not wanting to be naked, a long word - 
she had forgotten there was a time she wasn&#8217;t constantly naked.&nbsp; 
The woman was saying something else now, something she did understand, something about going to another place, she was used to that.&nbsp; This woman seemed in a big hurry about it though, and she - wait! - she! - the woman WAS Ayla!!! - Ayla was her - oh, there was a word - her friend!&nbsp; Ariel! - that was her own name!&nbsp; She still did not understand, but she knew that if Ayla wanted to go somewhere else, then she would go with her.&nbsp; She did her best to hurry, but did not protest when Ayla simply picked her up, put her over her shoulder, and ran off.

EMMS RUNNING FILE - DAY 14

From: Head Manager
To: Chief of Security

You weren&#8217;t in the loop on this, so I&#8217;m letting you know now.&nbsp; There&#8217;s no change in our general policy allowing Department Heads open use of merchandise as part of the benefits package.&nbsp; I&#8217;m assuming you were not aware that Marketing has assigned Emms exclusively to female clientele in the short term.&nbsp; Once she&#8217;s back in rotation you&#8217;re welcome to continue using her daily.&nbsp; Just check with marketing.
________

Ayla seemed to know where she was going - which was good, Ariel vaguely recalled that there were people here who did not want her to leave.&nbsp; That&#8217;s right - she was a prisoner, that was the word.&nbsp; And now she was being carried down one corridor after another.&nbsp; She almost began to be interested in what might happen.

Suddenly Ariel felt the two of them stop, and Ayla put her on the ground.&nbsp; She kneeled at Ayla&#8217;s feet, alert enough to be able to look around.&nbsp; A lot of corridors seemed to meet around here - this looked vaguely familiar, she&#8217;s been here before once, she was sure.&nbsp; But why had Ayla pulled out that long metal thing - those were nasty things, Ariel recalled, you got really bad shocks from them - but Ayla wouldn&#8217;t hurt her, she knew that, that was the only fixed point in the empty horizon of her mind.

It must have something to do with those six - what was that word? - guards up ahead.&nbsp; Maybe they didn&#8217;t like Ayla - why wouldn&#8217;t they like Ayla?&nbsp; Everybody should like Ayla.&nbsp; Still, it sure looked like they didn&#8217;t, and they were spreading out across the hallway and advancing.&nbsp; Ayla looked worried - Ariel remembered that word - but ready.&nbsp; 

EMMS RUNNING FILE - DAY 15

From: Manager of Marketing
To: Head Manager

Quick update - I&#8217;ve shifted this one to different duties, or at least additional ones.&nbsp; Mistress Regina&#8217;s suggestion that we move her to female clients was working out quite well.&nbsp; On the other hand the snafu with Security delayed any likely date of moving her back to penetrative services (though arguably it proves she was capable), and realistically there were not enough regular female clients to make it worthwhile keeping her only on that.&nbsp; We had already decide to try a new marketing initiative: a display cabinet in the market, with three or four of the girls there at a time as a way of showing our wares.&nbsp; I was rotating the girls, but I&#8217;ve started leaving Emms there much of the time - the marketing use outweighs most of her value here.&nbsp; I&#8217;d like to claim this part as a stroke of genius, but to be honest it&#8217;s just good fortune.&nbsp; Emms had a habit of trying to cover herself with her hands.&nbsp; The others quickly took to pulling her arms away, pinning them behind her back, forcing her up against the glass, and so on.&nbsp; Drew a much bigger crowd than it otherwise would have - a real tourist attraction. 
________

Ariel wondered whether she had begun to hallucinate.&nbsp; Two guards at the back had suddenly fallen to the ground screaming, and there was some kind of animal leaping past them.&nbsp; Except it wasn&#8217;t an animal - it - she - it - she was walking, just like Ayla, but it - she - had stripes and a long tail, and sharp claws.&nbsp; The other guards turned to look, which was the point at which Ayla stuck one of them in the neck with her metal thing, then clubbed another with the handle so that he fell to the floor.&nbsp; By then the she-animal was standing up from the still body of another guard, but the last one had disappeared down a hallway.

Ayla cried out �Tiger - thank god you showed up just then!&nbsp; But why aren&#8217;t you waiting at the rendezvous?�&nbsp; �Bad news, Sis - some kind of smoke-break or something by that door.&nbsp; There are a bunch of guards there - I don&#8217;t think they were on to us, but we&#8217;ve got to find a different way out and down to the river. And fast, since that guy who just left will be sounding the alarm.&nbsp; If they&#8217;re smart - and everything I&#8217;ve heard about Pantheon House suggests they are - there&#8217;ll be a member of their top brass with a bunch of guards at every door pretty soon�.

Tiger and Ayla looked around the corridor, at the various entrances and hallways, trying to decide which route to take.&nbsp; �Door� said Ariel, then added �trap�.&nbsp; �Oh Ariel, thank god you&#8217;re talking again� cried Ayla, rushing to hug her&nbsp; �I was so worried - we all were!&nbsp; Ever since that escaped prisoner sent word to us you were here, we&#8217;ve been trying to find a way to get you out�.&nbsp; �Door...trap� repeated Ariel.&nbsp; �Which door is a trap, hun?&nbsp; Is there a route we should avoid?&nbsp; We&#8217;ve got to get going!�&nbsp; �Door..trap....door..trap....door.� Ariel kept repeating the two words over and over.&nbsp;

I&#8217;m going to assume this was an innocent mistake, but it has cost us money - I don&#8217;t want to see this sort of thing happening again.&nbsp; Emms was shifted from her female-only clientele status, but not back into rotation - she was not meant to be available as part of the benefits package yet.&nbsp; It was an especially bad choice to use her for the department&#8217;s annual party - especially given that yours is the largest department.&nbsp; The value of this asset is rapidly dropping.
________

�Ayla� said Tiger, following the small woman&#8217;s gaze, �look up�.&nbsp; In the ceiling above them, almost imperceptible, was the outline of a small rectangle in the ceiling.&nbsp; Standing, Ayla pushed at it, and the trap door slid to one side.&nbsp; Ayla smiled.&nbsp; �C&#8217;mon Tiger, let&#8217;s get her up there - this is our way out!�

The space was a small one - Tiger and especially Ayla were slowed enough that Ariel kept up quite easily.&nbsp; And the route was clear - a straight path leading a long distance, but with the light of outdoors shining clearly at them.&nbsp; They hurried along as best they could, till they reached a grill covering the exit. Ayla had no difficulty pushing the grill away, and then jumped down to the ground, catching Ariel as Tiger hurried her out from behind.&nbsp; Ayla turned just in time to hear a clicking sound, then found that she was unable to move her arms or legs.&nbsp; Some sort of - field - held her motionless.

EMMS RUNNING FILE - DAY 26

From: Chief of Security
To: Deputy Chief for Investigations

Everyone did a good job stopping yesterday&#8217;s attempted mass escape - it shows what training and preparation can do.&nbsp; Our perfect record - never an escaped prisoner - remains intact!&nbsp; The ringleaders have already been punished and questioned, and we&#8217;ve closed a number of potential security risks.&nbsp; The only remaining concern I have relates to Emms.&nbsp; She clearly wasn&#8217;t a ringleader - odds are she didn&#8217;t even know of the plan until it happened, and just took advantage of the opportunity.&nbsp; Nonetheless, she wasn&#8217;t found for hours, long after the others, and she was the only one actually to get outside the building.&nbsp; Clearly there is some gap in our security that we need to fix.&nbsp; Emms has not willingly told us what it is.&nbsp; You are authorized to do what is necessary to discover it.
________

�What have we here?� a lyrical voice holding a small remote control said, �Emms...and this must be Ayla, I assume�.&nbsp; Automatically Ariel tried to kneel in front of Mistress Regina, though the field held her stationary.&nbsp; 

�You&#8217;d better let us go right now� Ayla said, �If we&#8217;re not at our rendezvous point in two minutes the reinforcements show up�.&nbsp; Mistress Regina laughed musically.&nbsp; �Girl, really, full marks for bravery, but you are a very bad liar.&nbsp; Your only reinforcement is your striped friend still in the roof tunnel - you might as well show yourself, dear.�&nbsp; Defiantly, Tiger came to the entrance, but did not drop down.&nbsp; �And your only escape plan is that boat over there - which won&#8217;t start very well without this.�&nbsp; Mistress Regina dangled the boat&#8217;s ignition key in the air.

�Did you really think it was that simple to get in, and more importantly, out, of Pantheon House? You would never normally have been allowed to book this one&#8217;s services...she&#8217;s obviously not suited.&nbsp; You got in because you were permitted to get in.&nbsp; And do you think there are normally so few guards?&nbsp; No, no, girl, they had to be told to be elsewhere for you to have gotten this far.&nbsp; Though I must congratulate you on the encounter you did have - that was unintended, and the two of you showed great spirit.&nbsp; Very promising indeed.�

From: Head Manager
To: Mistress of Physical Assets

I&#8217;ve reviewed this matter, but I&#8217;m backing up Security on this one - the decision to move Emms from your dorm to isolation, and into pain and domination services, stands.&nbsp; I understand your argument that if the first week didn&#8217;t have the desired effect more time isn&#8217;t likely to, but at this stage discovering our security weaknesses outweighs her potential value in any other way.
________

�And what&#8217;s your plan now?� asked Ayla, doing her best to sound unconcerned.&nbsp; 

�Come come, girl, naivete suits you even less well than lying� the Mistress sneered.&nbsp; �Besides, I think by any calculation I&#8217;m the one who ought to be asking the questions�.

�Emms!� said the Mistress �Look at me, little one - pay attention.� Ariel looked at the Mistress. �Emms - are these two your friends?�&nbsp; Ariel looked confused.&nbsp; �Did they show up to try to rescue you? Had they hoped to take you somewhere safe?�&nbsp; Ariel nodded with more enthusiasm than she had managed to show for weeks.

EMMS RUNNING FILE - DAY 64

From: Manager of Marketing
To: Head Manager

We&#8217;re nearly at the stage of writing this one off, unfortunately.&nbsp; I&#8217;ve had to take her out of P&amp;D - she stopped actually caring about the pain weeks ago, which removed any punishment or interrogation purpose, and she&#8217;s stopped pretending to care since then, which makes her of no interest to the clients.&nbsp; I did try leashing her in the waiting room for a few days as something for clients to amuse themselves with before their appointments, but frankly most of them seemed to find her depressing.&nbsp; I&#8217;ve put her into our �discount bin� services for the moment, but we&#8217;ll have to decide what to do.&nbsp; I doubt we can find a purchaser any more.
________

�Well, then�, the Mistress said, and Ariel suddenly fell to the kneel she had attempted and Ayla nearly stumbled as control of her limbs suddenly came back to her �you&#8217;d better take these and hurry�.&nbsp; Mistress Regina tossed the keys at Ayla, who caught them, dumbfounded.

Mistress Regina laughed.&nbsp; �You do shock quite well, dear, I&#8217;d stick with that one.&nbsp; Hurry along now, eventually someone is bound to remember where they found her last time.�&nbsp; Tiger leaped down to the ground and the three of them began to move toward the boat.&nbsp; As she passed Mistress Regina, Ariel paused for a moment, looked up at her and said, quietly and with difficulty, �why?�.&nbsp; The Mistress looked down towards the small woman, her expression difficult to read.&nbsp; �I told them I don&#8217;t like my girls to get hurt� she said finally.&nbsp; �Besides�, she added, a not-remotely-pleasant smile scarring her mouth, �My colleague in Security will be quite surprised when he discovers how many of today&#8217;s orders deploying guards to the wrong locations have his signature on them.&nbsp; I&#8217;m looking forward to seeing the expression on his face.&nbsp; Now go.�

The three climbed quickly into the boat, feeling their last doubts disappear as it started promptly and sped off down the river.&nbsp; Looking back, their last sight was of Mistress Regina fitting the grill back into the opening and walking calmly around the corner, never turning to look at their departure.

PANTHEON HOUSE ANNUAL REPORT - EXTRACT

...We bid farewell this year to our longstanding Chief of Security, who is leaving to pursue other interests.&nbsp; We are pleased to announce that Mistress Regina has agreed to add the title of Chief of Security to her already demanding responsibilities as Mistress of Physical Assets...
