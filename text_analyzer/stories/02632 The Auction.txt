Synopsis: she agrees to let her husband join an exclusive wife-swapping club, with bad results!The Auction.    
By Jill Bird.  
Part 1.   
 "But why an auction? It's just making me into a prostitute!" Jill had her
  angry and hurt look; one, which Mark knew, meant she was about to dig her heels
  in.  
 "No, it won't!" Mark had to tread carefully now if he was going to get his
  beautiful wife to go along with the plan. "What it is, er, is instead of the
  old seedy thing of throwing the men's car keys onto a table and then letting
  the women pick up a key at random, the men bid for the woman of their choice.
  This way, the men get a chance to have a choice of who they take, the husbands
  might make a bit of money if their wife is a good looker. And the women get
  a chance to be paraded in front of an audience," he finished lamely.  
 Jill still didn't seem convinced. " Oh yes, and what about any unfortunate
  women who don't get bought; they are going to be mortified. And the husband
  who might be left with his own wife!" she put a hand to her mouth, stifling
  an involuntary smile.  
 "That won't happen. Only good-looking women are invited to compete, and
  of course all the men will want a woman for the night. That's why they're going,
  after all," explained Mark. He knew that his wife's objections were mainly
  just a show of reluctance; she was as keen on this as he was. They had agreed
  in principle to go to a swinger's party, ages ago but were only now getting
  the details sorted out.  
 "So I go on show in front of a load of randy old goats and then get taken
  off by the one with the most money?" Mark shrugged, "I suppose that's about
  it, but I promise that none of the men are going to be too ugly for you to
  stomach." Jill seemed to be giving it some thought. "Okay, lets do it, if that's
  what you want."  
Mark relaxed, letting his breath out slowly, not wanting his wife to see
  his relief.  
 Later, over drinks, they began to discuss the details. Mark explained that
  the auction would take place at a local motel, in the evening. The place had
  a small cabaret room with a low stage on which the women would be displayed.
  It would be like a sort of Miss World contest, in that they would each be brought
  on singly, then as a group and then singly again for the bidding.  
 "Will we all be naked all the time?" Jill asked.  
 "Well, all the details haven't been finalised yet but you'll probably keep
  your clothes on, at least until the bidding starts", bluffed Mark, who in truth
  didn't know for sure.  
 "If you think I'm going to parade in the nude for a gang of men then you
  must be very optimistic!" she snapped.  
****************************  
 Mark had met the man a few weeks earlier when he had visited a lap-dancing
  club with some colleagues from work. The man hadn't been a member of their
  party but he began chatting to Mark, casually, about the girls' relative attributes
  and performing skills. They had gotten on well. The mans' name was Harry and
  he was a lot older than Mark, about 50 or so, Mark guessed. It seemed that
  Harry was a man of some means, owning property and a motel in a nearby town.  
 Harry observed that the lap-dancers, although very attractive were really
  just a fantasy; no real contact was possible, and even if a girl could be bought
  then it would be simply a commercial transaction on her part. Sex with a price
  tag was a poor substitute for a varied diet of real women. "Yes," said Mark, "That's
  all very well, but how can any man, except the most handsome or famous, ever
  manage to get his hands on so many women? When you have a job to hold down,
  and a wife to keep happy, then even finding the time to look for willing women
  was difficult." Harry laughed, you had to get organised, he said; you had to
  find a group of like-minded men who would lend their own women in expectation
  of receiving similar favours. That way, with an ever-widening circle of such
  acquaintances then there would be a continuous supply of women for his use.
  Mark tried to follow the strangers' meaning through an alcoholic haze. "You
  mean wife-swapping!" he almost shouted. "Oh, that's no use. You'd need to get
  her involved, and that's too complicated. Simple, anonymous sex is what we
  want; no names, no personal details exchanged, that's the best."  
 Harry shook his head sadly, " I thought you were listening, lad. But you've
  not heard a word. I'm telling you that there's a way to get all the cunt you
  want and you go off dreaming again. Look, if you want to receive then you have
  to give a little. And you'll get plenty if you can persuade your wife to play
  ball; most women will, you know. They love to be the subject of a strangers'
  lust. And, remember; an excited, nervous woman who may or may not be willing,
  is infinitely more interesting than any paid slack-eyed whore" Suddenly Harry
  stood up and moved as if to leave. He reached into an inside pocket and pulled
  out a business card. "Give me a ring, and we'll talk again," he said, "goodbye." And
  with that he walked directly out of the club.  
 After the man left, Mark watched some more dancing but now he saw how dis-interested
  the girls were. Their expressions were fixed in smiles but their tired eyes
  revealed the lies. Feeling strangely dissatisfied he had gone home, leaving
  the other men to it.  
************************  
 "So how do I have to dress?" she asked. "I suppose something kinky, sussies,
  or rubber gear or something?"  
 "No, Harry says to wear whatever we like, whatever we think is sexy."  
*************************  
 Mark had called Harry shortly after their first meeting in the club. They
  had had regular meetings in the evenings after work since then. Harry had invited
  Mark to join the "little swingers gang" that he had been organising for a couple
  of years now.  
 "But you'll have to bring your own little woman; no free rides. So get on
  with talking her into it. And of course, I'll need to see a couple of photos
  of her; Jill isn't it? No offence meant, but the high quality of the group
  has to be maintained."  
 Mark had taken his time with Jill, broaching the subject of swinging in
  roundabout ways. They had even acted out fantasies in the bedroom of Jill being
  taken by a stranger; sometimes she was "raped", others consenting to be shared
  with another man.  
 Eventually it had been Jill who had suggested they try swinging. Mark had
  felt a bit hurt, even though it was his idea. He told Jill that he didn't think
  they should get into a regular thing with some other couple. That seemed sort
  of sordid. No, lets see if we can find a "scene" which will be so different
  that we will only need to join it occasionally; giving us something to look
  forward to. That is, if we decide to do it more than once.  
*************************************  
 It was another evening met in a pub. Harry bought the beers. "So. Have you
  decided to join us or what?" he asked.  
 "Yes. But there's just one or two things I need to get straight," muttered
  mark. "You see, what about Jill? I mean, will she find herself with some ugly
  old git whose going to turn her right off? If that happens she wont give us
  another opportunity to swap again!" Harry smiled, "Don't worry, lad. She'll
  be all right. The men are all reasonably good-looking, if not all Hugh Grants!" He
  chuckled at his little joke.  
 "So. Have you made a decision? If you've brought a couple of photos, I will
  be able to tell you if you can join us."  
 Mark brought out the half dozen pictures of Jill he had taken over the past
  couple of years. Jill in a bikini on holiday. Jill at a party wearing a posh
  frock. Jill gardening in jeans. Harry looked them over with approval. "Very
  nice, lad." He smiled, "she'll do nicely"  
 The two men then talked about the details; time and place, Jill's' clothes,
  protocol.  
 "Protocol?" asked Mark.  
 "Oh yes, lad. There's things to remember to do, and not do." He told Mark
  how he must not interfere in the proceedings once they had begun. They were
  both expected to abide by the rules of the club and they must not dispute with
  the bidders.  
 "Even if you don't like the winner or the choice of women you are left with
  you must say nothing. And." Here his voice became more urgent with a firm authority
  Mark hadn't noticed before. "And you must not try to prevent your wife being
  led away by her buyer. You'd be surprised how many men suddenly lose their
  nerve when they see her go with another man. Neither of you will be allowed
  to change your minds".  
***************************  
 "So. It's all arranged, is it?" Jill asked, a bit sniffilly.  
 "Only if you are in agreement," answered Mark.  
 "I don't have to stand naked, do I?"  
 "No, just wearing whatever you feel happy in," said Mark, who in truth was
  hoping she would allow herself to be displayed completely nude. He had had
  to explain to Harry that she would not participate unless that was clearly
  understood. Harry had accepted her condition reluctantly. He had been hoping
  the couple would be a little more submissive but he didn't want to risk losing
  their involvement. Harry had followed Jill secretly a couple of times as she
  had come into town to work or shop and had decided that she was a very good-looking
  woman. She would do very nicely.  
************************************  
 They decided that Jill would wear simple, rather conservative clothes. They
  went out shopping for a blue pleated skirt, tiny white panties, a white blouse,
  and high heeled pumps with ankle straps; she would go bra-less.  
 The auction was planned for the following Tuesday evening. Their nervousness
  grew with every passing hour.  
*********************************  
 During the late afternoon of Tuesday, Harry phoned to check that they were
  still on. Mark assured him that they would be there.  
 Jill took a long slow bath and washed her blonde hair. Mark watched her
  dry herself and then put on a little make-up, his heart beginning to beat more
  quickly. When she was dressed and ready she looked so beautiful he almost changed
  his mind and wanted to have sex with her there and then and to hell with the
  auction.  
 "No Mark, you know Harry's rule; we can't have sex during the day before!" Mark
  knew the rule but felt hurt that his wife was so keen to abide by it.  
 Mark drove to the motel, a journey of about an hour. The tension in the
  car was almost measurable. They hardly spoke. When they arrived, a sign read, "no
  vacancies". A dozen or so cars were already parked. The place looked respectable,
  it was fairly new and was well maintained. They parked outside cabin 32 and
  went inside. There was no need to book in; Harry had sent the key through the
  post. Still unspeaking, Jill tidied her make-up and they had a drink from a
  free mini-bar in the corner of the room.  
 After they had waited nervously for twenty minutes, the phone rang, making
  them both jump. It was Harry. They were to come to the office. "Remember, Mark;
  you must not come in, you will go directly to the cabaret room!"  
 They walked together to the office. At the door they kissed and Jill went
  inside. Mark stood for a moment and then, with a sense of loss, walked to the
  large building at the end of the car park.  
 A smirking doorman/bouncer let him in. His eyes slowly became accustomed
  to the gloom and he saw Harry approaching. "Mark, good to see you!" he boomed,
  shaking hands. He led Mark through a smoky, rather tatty cabaret room to a
  polished glass topped bar.  
 "Have a drink." As Mark sipped at a single malt he looked around the room.
  He mentioned to Harry that there seemed to be a large number of men present,
  perhaps fifteen or twenty of them.  
 "I didn't expect so many unaccompanied men", said Mark, feeling increasingly
  uneasy.  
 "The more the merrier, eh?" Harry grinned and slapped him on the shoulder.  
 At that moment spotlights illuminated the small raised stage and a female
  stripper came on. She was very pretty but the audience didn't seem to be very
  interested, Mark had the feeling they were paying him more attention. Whenever
  he looked away from Harry he felt surreptitious eyes turning away from him.  
 At that moment the phone on the bar rang and Harry answered it. As he spoke
  he looked directly at Marks face. "Yeh it's me. All ready? Is she being good?
  Oh dear did she? Did you? Good, good. Right then, let's get her on." He put
  the phone down and spoke to Mark, "Now then lad", said Harry, in his "down
  to business" tone. "It's just about time for the proceedings to begin. We'll
  go and sit down in a moment. Just let me tell you about a slight change in
  the programme. We often insert a theme to make things more interesting, and
  tonight the theme is bondage. I'm glad to say Jill seems to be very enthusiastic! "  
 "Jill?" exclaimed Mark. "What do you mean?"  
"She's a very talented girl, lad. Now go and sit down with my two friends
  here while I get things started." As Harry turned away, Mark tried to follow
  but was blocked by two muscular men who guided him to a table and then sat
  down on each side of him.  
 On the stage, the stripper cut short her gyrations as Harry approached with
  a microphone in his hand.  
*****************************  
 When Jill entered the reception office she was met by a shy looking young
  man in his early twenties. "Hello, you must be Jill", he said. Jill just nodded,
  she felt even more nervous with this young man who must have known why she
  was here. The young man came from behind the desk, " I just have to check you
  out; sort of see that you are suitably dressed, okay?"  
 "What!" she exclaimed, because he was already lifting her skirt. "Get off
  me, you little shit!" Without a pause the man slapped her hard across the face,
  stunning her; no one had ever hit her in her whole life! As her head reeled
  he pushed her face down across the desk and pulled her arms behind her. He
  tied her thumbs together, using a noose of thin cord, which must have been
  prepared earlier because it took only a moment to render her helpless. Keeping
  her face pressed onto the melamine surface with one hand he used the other
  to pull her skirt up over her bottom. She felt her panties being tugged down
  to her knees, and then, after being aware of him fumbling around for something,
  felt the most awful burning pain across the cheeks of her bottom. He pulled
  her upright again and she saw he was holding a very thin cane, the sort that
  school teachers once used to punish naughty children. The pain it had caused
  to her was incredible! "Now then, just stand there for a moment," he ordered.
  As she stood, he crouched down and pulled her panties down to her ankles. "Step
  out of them!" he stammered. Jill obeyed; she didn't want another taste of that
  cane.  
 "You certainly are a stupid sort of a cunt," he explained, "You've just
  changed the nature of the game. You only had to do as you were told but you
  failed the test. And now, well like I said, it's a new game."  
 He picked up the phone and dialled, "It's Simon. She's all ready. No, she
  point-blank refused, so I've given her a stroke of Mister Cane and she's feeling
  a lot better. Okay, on our way." Putting down the phone he reached into a desk
  drawer and brought out an object. Forcing her jaws open by squeezing both sides
  of her jawbone inwards, he pushed it into her mouth. It was a plastic ball-gag,
  hollow and with holes all around its wall. He strapped it in place by a leather
  strap, which buckled at the back of her head. Jill could breathe okay, but
  the helpless feeling of being a non-person it engendered was indescribable.  
 "Okay cunt, follow me!" he ordered, and without checking to see if she was
  obeying him he walked to a door at the rear of the room. Jill followed him
  like the muzzled bitch puppy she had become.  
*****************************************  
 "Testing, testing!" yelled Harry into the microphone, tapping it with his
  finger to make sure it was working. "Friends, welcome to my place. I hope you've
  all enjoyed the show so far," murmurs of concurrence answered him, "good, good.
  Well, to finish off the evening we have a guest performer. She's a lovely little
  lady by the name of Jill." Mark stirred at hearing his wife's name, as if to
  protest, but one of his unknown companions touched his arm and gave a slow
  shake of his head, and he kept quiet.  
 "Now then," continued Harry, "Jill was originally a volunteer for tonight
  but sadly, or not, as how you see it, she declined to play the game during
  the initial part of the procedure and is now the principal performer in our
  bondage theme show. We may thank her husband, Mark for her presence here tonight.
  Gentlemen, I give you Jill."  
*****************************  
 She followed the man through the door and down a short corridor, passing
  a large kitchen where cooks were preparing hot spicy food. One Asian looking
  man watched as she passed the open door. When he reached the end door the man
  opened it and gestured for her to go through first. It was darker and Jill
  could hear an amplified voice booming out. She was shocked to hear her name
  announced and a hand pushed her forward through a curtain and she was on a
  small stage, under hot bright spotlights! She had to squint through her eyelids
  to see. A large man in a suit was grinning at her and applause from an unseen
  audience was greeting her appearance.  
 Simon prodded her forward with the tip of his cane until she was standing
  in the centre of the raised platform. He came and stood beside her and used
  the cane to raise her skirt a couple of inches to reveal her pubic mound. He
  made her turn around and did the same again, to show her naked bottom and then
  walked off the stage.  
 Jill waited with trepidation and fear wondering what was to happen to her.  
***********************************  
 Mark watched with a mixture of apprehension and excited anticipation as
  his lovely wife stood waiting with fear across her face. Around him the men
  sniggered and made obscene comments about her.  
 When the sounds suddenly sank to a murmur both he and his wife looked around
  to see the reason. A huge man, fat and naked was approaching her from behind.
  Mark gasped and almost called out to her. The man's cock was circumcised and
  partly erect.  
Jill suddenly became aware of a presence behind her and tried to turn to
  see him properly but the man grabbed a handful of her hair and pulled her head
  back sharply. She was pulled back against his chest and his other arm came
  around her and he tore her blouse open, revealing her firm, pointy breasts.
  Immediately, his hand dropped to the waistband of her skirt and tugged at it
  until the fastener broke and the skirt was allowed to slide down her legs to
  the floor. He dragged her away from the remains of her clothes. Now he removed
  the gag. Jill had a thousand things she wanted to scream at these awful people,
  she wanted to tell them how humiliated she felt, and that they had no right
  to use her as a fuck-piece. But now she could speak she kept quiet, afraid
  of their anger.  
 The man grabbed the woman's bush of pubic hair and dragged her off the stage,
  parading her between the tables so the audience could get a close-up look at
  her. She cried with pain as he led her along, her hips thrust out before her.
  As she passed Mark's table she saw him and glared at him. She tried to speak
  but the words wouldn't come.  
One of Mark's guards squeezed the cheek of her bottom and then smirked at
  him as if to say, "what are you going to do about it?" Mark wanted to sink
  down in his seat, to become invisible.  
********************************  
 The fat man took her back to the small stage where he sat her on a table,
  facing forward. She looked sad and pathetic as she waited while he made some
  sort of preparations. The man was pulling down an apparatus, which lowered
  from the ceiling and consisted of two ropes with leather straps on the ends.
  When the straps were close enough, the man took her ankles and pulled her legs
  up so she fell onto her back. While he buckled a strap to each ankle, his flabby
  body kept brushing against her as he moved about, revolting her. Occasionally
  his ugly cock came close to her face and she knew that soon she was going to
  have to suck it, the thought alone made her retch.  
 And then, her ankles were being pulled upwards, her legs straightening above
  her. When her bottom began to lift, the man helped her up by supporting, firmly
  but surprisingly gently, her neck and shoulders in his big hands. She began
  to panic; she was being hoisted upside down into the air! She began to struggle,
  wriggling violently to try to get free. "Behave, cunt!" snapped the man, but
  he didn't hit her because a moment later she was swinging by her ankles.  
*****************************  
 This was all going horribly wrong, thought Mark as he saw his wife swing;
  this wasn't what he had had in mind!  
****************************  
 The man climbed up onto the table and Jill's position and height was adjusted
  until her head was level with his hips. Jill's struggles subsided as she dangled
  facing the man's fat cock, which was becoming harder. She could see a bead
  of cum seeping from its' evil-looking slit. The man gave her bottom a hard
  slap to swing her body around a few degrees. He came close to her and put one
  arm around her waist and lifted her a few inches. This allowed her knees to
  bend a little and she felt him touch her vagina with his free hand. She gasped
  as he parted her lips and then pressed his mouth to them, pushing his tongue
  deep into her.  
***************************  
 In the audience Mark heard her moan as the man sucked and lapped at his
  wife's pussy.  
**************************  
 Jill felt herself moisten with juice as the man gave her the cunt-lick of
  her life! She pushed herself up against his mouth, squirmed her groin around
  to obtain even more pleasure; her knees were now completely bent, resting on
  his shoulders, her thighs pressing against his ears! She almost felt sorry
  when, a moment later, he took his mouth away. From her awkward position she
  could see he had turned partly away from her. She was aware that the audience
  had become quiet again, waiting.  
*****************************  
 Marks emotions were on a roller-coaster! He was excited by the sight of
  his wife in such intimate contact with the stranger, but was dismayed and shocked
  by her obvious enjoyment of the mans handling of her. What was he doing now?  
 The naked man was reaching behind his back to where an Asian man in kitchen
  workers uniform was passing an object to him.  
***************************  
 From her inverted position, Jill saw the man take something in his hand.
  She heard the audience sniggering, someone shouted but she didn't catch the
  words. Then the man waved something in front of her face. It was a wooden pepper
  grinder, the sort that waiters twist over your dinner; it was as thick as a
  mans wrist and about two feet long. For a moment she was puzzled; what was
  he doing with that? Then, as realisation hit her, the audience guffawed as
  the look of horror spread over her lovely face.  
 "Oh no!" She cried, please don't do that to me!" Jill had never had children
  and knew that her vagina was not as large and accommodating as some women's
  were.  
 The man still held her around the waist; with his free hand he pressed the
  rounded, bulbous top of the grinder into the juices around her pussy.  
 "Oh, oh, aargh!" she gasped, as the grinder was forced between the lips
  of her cunt, it was too thick, much wider than a mans penis! The man twisted
  it in the creamy fluid and her lips parted obediently, allowing the wide object
  into the opening. She tried to pull away from it but the man held her waist
  firmly and the awful intruder squeezed four inches into her body.  
**************************  
 Unseen by the hanging woman, two men came with a spreader bar, which was
  fitted between the two ropes about six feet up from her ankles. Now Jill was
  gently lowered until her weight was again taken by her ankles, but now her
  legs were kept wide apart by the spreader. The pain in her crotch was awful
  and she tried to relieve it by arching her back and pushing out with her cunt
  muscles.  
***************************  
 Mark was surprised at how beautiful his wife looked; hanging with her back
  curved, her hair hanging down and her shapely legs making a vee in the air.
  Her muscles all stood out through her skin, which glistened with sweat. Her
  beautiful breasts pointed outwards, bobbing gently. The pepper grinder looked
  shocking, protruding from her crotch. The grinning man, turned back to Jill.  
*****************************  
 Jill groaned as the man took hold of the grinder and began to twist and
  push it deeper into her. She tried to relax her vaginal walls and let it come
  into her more easily; soon only a few inches were left sticking out.  
 The man stood to one side and swung her on her ropes, letting the spectators
  see her properly. She was getting used to the awful fullness, just getting
  her breath back, when he took hold of her clit. Her stubby clit had been trapped
  between the grinder and her vaginal wall and the tip was just showing. He gripped
  it with his finger and thumb and pulled it out. "Owwwhhh!" He stretched it
  out. Jill began to turn as he rolled her clit in his fingers, first to the
  right and then the left. He kept acting on the stretched clit and she kept
  turning with it, a half turn each way. The mans cock was sticking out at her,
  very hard now and curving wickedly. As the man rolled her clit she continued
  to turn on her ropes and the leaking tip of the cock pressed against her face
  leaving a trail of slimy precum on her skin.  
 The man was causing the rolling to increase in speed and Jill was becoming
  dizzy. If only he would stop making her turn! But he didn't; it kept on, making
  her feel worse. She had to stop herself turning! The next time the slimy fat
  cock slid across her face, Jill opened her mouth and sucked in the horrid purple
  thing. With her teeth she managed to grip it firmly behind its bulbous head.
  The twisting stopped. Jill held on to the growing penis as hard as she could,
  sucking when her teeth could not keep up their grip.  
 The man began to suck on her clit, driving her mad. Again she began to squirm,
  pushing her cunt at him. She sucked greedily on the cock in her mouth, mumbling
  sounds of pleasure.  
 Jill no longer heard the audiences' cheers and insults. She was aware just
  of her need to cum. The man sucked and nibbled at her clit, occasionally twisting
  the pepper pot gently in and out of her stretched hole.  
 Sweat was pouring down her body, stinging her eyes. The wet bristly hairs
  of the mans balls hanging in front, scratched her eyes, making things worse.  
 The situation was so strange, so totally different to anything she had ever
  experienced that her emotions were becoming totally mixed together. The intruder
  in her cunt, the sucking on her clit, the cock in her mouth all combined with
  the knowledge that to her captors she was just a stupid arsehole of a bitch;
  all these worked on her psyche turning her into a mass of perverted desire!
  A hot rush began to pass through her from her feet, rushing down to her head.
  She arched her back, thrusting her cunt at him as far as she could, while at
  the same time sucking even harder at the evil tasting cock. Jill's body shook
  all over as her orgasm hit her like a train! She couldn't breath but she didn't
  care; she just wanted to keep the beautiful, choking penis in her mouth. Suddenly
  the man shoved harder than ever before, she felt something in her throat open,
  the cock head throbbed and hot jizz gushed down her gullet. She couldn't swallow;
  her epiglottis was held firmly open by the fat knob, but she didn't need to;
  the hot cum gushed straight down into her belly.  
***********************************  
 Mark watched in horrified fascination as his wife, cheered and jeered on
  by the audience, turned red in the face, almost asphyxiated by the cock down
  her throat and began to shake convulsively. Someone nearby said that it had
  been a while since he had watched a bitch get choked to death by dick. They
  wouldn't kill her, would they?  
**********************************  
 Jill also thought she was going to die, waves of blackness washed over her.
  Her head pounded. And then the choking cock was pulled free. Jill drew in a
  lungful of air and then was hit by a fit of retching; scummy vomit came gushing
  up out of her mouth, squirting out of her nostrils. The naked woman writhed
  and twisted in the air, gasping and spluttering until she was able to breathe
  again. The audience cheered and applauded.  
 When the man stood away from her she heard someone shout, "look at the teeth
  marks that bitch put in his cock!" It was true: the bloated prick looked like
  a dog had chewed it.  
 She was now left alone as the man went away, probably to bandage his dick,
  thought Jill.  
**************************  
 There was now a lull, and the houselights were turned on. Jill was left
  hanging, ignored, while people went to the bar for drinks. Mark considered
  going to her but thought he'd better not.  
 She wanted to be released and began to plead, "Please let me down! Please,
  I'm in pain, help me!" She still had the pepper pot embedded in her cunt. She
  tried to eject it with her vaginal muscles but it was too well fixed. Some
  passers-by sniggered; one slapped her bottom hard, sending her swinging again.
  Another man gave the pepper pot a shove, making her moan. "Cock-sucking whore," he
  snarled.  
****************************  
 Jill dangled in her misery for fifteen minutes, until most of the spectators
  had returned to their seats. She was alarmed to see the master of ceremonies
  return to the small stage.  
 "Friends, " he called into the microphone. "You have seen our young lady
  in action, she really took a beating there, didn't she? But she's a good sport,
  not many of our guests could stand that sort of treatment. Well, now that you've
  seen her in action, it's time to offer some of you the opportunity to finish
  off her performance." With that, he grasped the visible portion of the pepper
  pot and with some difficulty he pulled and twisted it free. It emerged with
  an audible squelch.  
 Holding it out to the side, as if it was repulsing him, he called, " Simon,
  the appliance."  
*******************************  
 From somewhere to the side, the young man who had caned her came into view
  with a whip, a cat-o-nine tails! Harry gave him the pepper pot and took from
  him the multi-flailed leather whip.  
 "Gentlemen, let us now start the bidding for the honour of giving this bitch
  a bloody good thrashing".  
 End of part one. 
The Auction.  
Part 2.  
 She knew she could take no more. She would die here, hanging by her ankles
  with a room full of men watching, lusting for her death. She closed her eyes
  and waited for the whipping to come. After a minute or two during which she
  was left alone, hands took firm hold of her shoulders and supported her as
  she felt herself being lowered.  
 Her thumbs were released from the loops and her ankles from their straps
  and she was allowed to sprawl across a table. Perhaps it was the change of
  position, but she became dizzy and suddenly vomited down the side of the table.
  The naked woman lay on her back with her legs spread wide, uncaring now of
  how many eyes were ogling her sore vagina. The audience, however were more
  interested in buying drinks at the bar, and she was largely ignored.  
 She was not to be allowed peace for long. Harry came by carrying a beer
  in one hand. "What's this mess doing still here?" he called theatrically, pointing
  to the vomit, which had run down the table leg and onto the floor. "Simon,
  bring the ladies' panties and blouse, will you?"  
 A moment later Jill was being jabbed in the ribs.  
 "Get up you lazy cunt!" It was Simon. He almost dragged her to her feet. "Get
  that mess cleaned up!" he snarled, pushing her panties into her hand. Painfully
  she began to mop up with the flimsy garment. When that was soon sodden, Simon
  gave her the blouse to use as well.  
 While she was cleaning up puke with her own clothes, Harry had begun addressing
  the audience, "Gentlemen, if you are all ready we will begin the bidding to
  be the wielder of the cat! Now, you have all seen her in action, a very dirty
  girl indeed. The winner will be allowed to administer ten strokes of the leather
  cat. Now who will start at say, &pound;20?"  
 The bidding began and soon had reached &pound;100. Mark, still in his seat
  wondered if he should bid in order to prevent his wife being beaten, but didn't
  think Harry would allow him to. In any case, maybe Jill deserved it; surely
  she hadn't needed to suck that mans dick so forcefully? No, better just sit
  it out.  
 Jill's mind was in a sort of fog as she cleaned. She knew there was some
  sort of auction going on but she didn't know what it was for. She didn't know
  why she was kneeling on the floor naked, cleaning up mess; perhaps she was
  at work, tidying up?  
She couldn't remember anything properly, she would ask Mark when she got
  home; he would know.  
 Harry came to her and pulled her to her feet. "Come on cunt, it's time."  
 "I've nearly finished mopping up, Harry. Won't be a minute."  
 "What?" said Harry, puzzled by her matter of fact tone.  
 "I said I'm nearly finished. Do you need something else mopping up?" she
  looked at him with an innocent expression.  
 "No, you silly cow, you've finished with that! It's time for your whipping,
  do you understand that?" Harry was getting a bit perplexed by her attitude.
  Did she really not know what was going on?  
 "Sorry, Harry. I just seem to be a bit muzzy at the moment. Where do you
  want me?" It was obvious that Jill had been traumatised by her recent treatment.
  Harry had seen it happen before with a woman's first time on the stage. The
  problem was that men didn't really want to watch a totally submissive woman
  being abused; they preferred her to resist at least a bit. And they were waiting
  to watch her be flogged. Oh well, we'd better get on with it.  
****************************  
 The fat man who had stuck the pepper pot up her had returned, completely
  naked. He gestured to Jill to approach him. She obeyed without hesitation,
  wobbling slightly on her high heels towards him.  
 The winner of the auction came through the tables accompanied by a cheer
  from the audience. Jill looked his way with curiosity and gave him a smile.
  From his seat Mark watched, wondering what she was playing at.  
 The fat man turned his back to the audience and positioned himself with
  his fat belly resting against the table on which Jill had lain. Harry guided
  the woman so that she pressed her front against his back. Then her arms were
  placed around his neck. It looked so intimate that Mark found himself getting
  angry again.  
 The man gripped her wrists and pulled her up his back until her feet left
  the ground. He leaned slightly forward so that the table gave him some support.  
 Harry announced down his microphone, " Okay, she's all yours. Here's the
  cat, so lay on!"  
 The winner, a sweaty office type in a grey suit took the leather handle
  and hefted it experimentally. Positioning himself just over an arms length
  from the woman's back, with his feet well spaced, he drew the cat back behind
  him. The crowd were silent, waiting. The whip made a whoosh as he swung it
  across her back, just below the shoulder blades.  
 Jill's reaction was electrifying. She screamed like a banshee! The almost
  catatonic body jerked so violently that the man holding her struggled to keep
  his grip on her wrists. The whip was applied again immediately with hardly
  a pause. The screaming rose even higher and she convulsed again.  
***************************  
 To Jill it was as if she had suddenly been roused from a deep sleep! The
  skin of her back was burning and, owwwhh! What was happening? Her arms and
  wrists were being pulled apart! She suddenly saw that she was being held against
  the fat mans back! Ugh! His shoulders and back were all covered in short black
  hair, and he stank of sweat! Agghhh! The lash again. Oh, she was being whipped!
  Why did these awful people have to hurt her like this? Did they want to kill
  her? She had to take some of the weight off her arms.  
*****************************  
 From his seat Mark watched fearfully. How far were they going with this?
  His wife couldn't take much more of this. Her body was being abused beyond
  all his expectations. He hadn't wanted this. Just to watch her get fucked while
  he fucked someone else, that was what he thought it would be.  
 Under the spotlights Jill lifted both her thighs and wrapped her legs around
  the fat mans hips.  
********************************  
 Jill was now able to take some of the weight off her arms. She gripped him
  like she was riding a horse. She didn't care about the jeers of the audience
  who took great delight at the sight of her wrapping herself around him as if
  she couldn't get close enough.  
********************************  
 Unbelievably, she had taken eight strokes of the cat. The whipsman wanted
  to apply the last two to her front. She was lowered to her feet and turned
  around. The fat man held her wrists behind her and the cat streaked out across
  her belly. She didn't scream, just made a loud gasp, as if she had been drenched
  in icy water. Another, last loud whoosh and the leather strips slapped over
  her ribs, leaving a red line across the lower curve of her breasts. The whipping
  was over. The exhausted woman was again allowed to sprawl across the table.  
 Harry made another appearance to announce that the auction and whipping
  were now at an end. The evening would continue, with more exotic dancers and
  a dirty comedian. The winner of the auction would now be permitted if he wished
  to take Jill to one of the bedrooms and use her for the rest of the night.  
 Jill was led away by the winner, along with two of his friends. Harry came
  over to Mark.  
 " A good show, son. Come to my office, we need a little chat." Mark got
  up and followed him through the cabaret roomful of smirking men who nudged
  each other as he passed.  
 In the small office Harry told him to sit. He poured them both a drink.  
 "You didn't need to do those things to my wife. She was ready to give you
  a public show. You didn't have to hurt her!" Mark blurted out bitterly. "My
  marriage is ruined now!" he wailed.  
 "No, it's not ruined at all," answered Harry. "From now on, you will call
  all the shots. That bitch will never speak back to you again. You call the
  shots. And, you are now a member of a very special club. Don't worry about
  those grinning fools out there; they're all here because they put their wives
  and girlfriends through similar ordeals. You will be grinning at some other
  guy soon, as his bitch gets the treatment."  
 Mark began to cheer up. "So I'm in, yes?"  
 "Of course you're in! Did you think I was going to renege on my word? I
  know it's been a bit rough for you and Jill. But this way she knows the score,
  and she will always be very amenable, believe me she wont ever dare refuse
  any request. We will require to use her now and again in the future, but you
  can come to our shows as often as you like. Now, off you go and enjoy the rest
  of the evening. You can keep the room for the night if you want and take her
  home tomorrow. Or we'll send her back when the lads have finished."  
 Mark swallowed his drink and, taking the shiny membership card proffered
  by Harry, he returned to the cabaret room.  
 On the stage, a beautiful black girl was taking off her clothes. But most
  of the men were watching a large closed circuit TV screen on which Jill was
  appearing. Three men were simultaneously using her mouth, cunt and anus.  
 Jill was wondering when she would be allowed to finish her mopping.  
 The End.
