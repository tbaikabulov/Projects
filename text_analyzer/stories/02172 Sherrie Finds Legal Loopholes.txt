Synopsis: Brilliant high flying defence lawyer Sherrie Nathan is found guilty of lesbianism and duly punished in accordance with the law.Sherrie Finds Legal Loopholes 
By Eve Adorer 
Chapter 1 � The Liberal Lawyer 
My name is Sherrie Nathan. I am a lawyer; a criminal lawyer; a defence lawyer
  and, yes, I have heard all the jokes about the similarity of the sound of my
  name with another far better known but, in his case, entirely fictional American
  defence lawyer. 
I am thirty now. The story I have to tell you, the story all my friends ask
  me to tell over and over, is about what happened to me when I was just twenty-five
  and a complete know-nothing first time defending barrister in a court of law
  in a foreign land. 
I am proud of my ability and feel no shame for what happened. A lawyer has
  to learn her craft. Apart from that one event, my record is second to none.
  Is it because I am a girl that people only want to hear of that one failure?
  Is it because I am a coloured girl that they enjoy it all the more? I have
  had to rise above petty jealousy and race discrimination to get where I am�����but
  I must not indulge my anger, you, I know, will understand and take my side. 
You need to know more about me to understand my side of the story; especially
  if you have heard the version of my ex live-in girlfriend Hannah ***** whom
  I still love despite her bad mouthing me. It was Hannah I defended in court
  that day��..but once more I am starting at the end and setting a bad example,
  most unlike the cool calm logical and ordered lawyer I was and still usually
  am. 
To set the scene, I must start with the jealousies. First and foremost, I
  am a girl with a brain. I studied law at C******** England, and passed out
  accepted as having been the brightest student of the decade. I went into the
  apprenticeship style practice that the English legal structure demands and
  rocketed through to become a junior barrister. And there, though I was only
  twenty-five, my career seemed to have stopped. 
The second jealousy was my beauty. Any girl who succeeds is accused of using
  her body strategically to gain favour. A five-foot-six-inch 38E-22-36 English
  / Japanese / Afro-Caribbean curly lower-back length brown haired brown eyed �stunner�,
  as I have been incredibly pleased to hear some men refer to me, has more of
  such jealous talk behind her back than most. 
As a girl at school, I had always been particularly conscious of my breasts.
  I knew that, compared with other girls of the same age, I was huge. As is the
  cruel way between children, the other girls, who called me �Tittyanna� behind
  my back, made me very self-conscious about my enormous chest. And then there
  was the way a once loved and trusted uncle began to look at me��.. 
But by the time I had reached sixteen, I fully realised that jealousy had
  been the cause of the past cruelty of my peers. I also began to appreciate
  I possessed two beautiful assets that would guarantee the adoration of men.
  For many a lovely man, a girl could never have too big a chest it seemed. I
  love men: adore girls. 
At sixteen I was yet to discover too, my real sexual orientation. When we
  met later in our teens, one girl who had been particularly nasty to me when
  we were both children at school together, clearly longed to get her hands down
  my cleavage. What joy it was to be adored by her, to deny her, to realise the
  power of my beauty and the beauty of my stupendously huge firm breasts in particular��� 
Why should I not know that I am beautiful? Why should I not be proud of my
  beauty? Why should I not dress to show my lovely legs and superbly huge firm
  breasts? There is nothing, but nothing in the world as beautiful as a beautiful
  girl. A beautiful girl is heaven-on-earth. Why should I not be proud to be
  living breathing talking walking heaven? 
The third jealousy I have always had to overcome, is racism. I have never
  ever used my charms for the gain I am accused of using them for. And I can
  never understand how supposedly liberal minded people can �sympathise� on the
  one hand with my being held back because I am one-third negro, whilst on the
  other hand accusing me of bedding other men to get to the top of my profession.
  And yet I suspect I do know why in fact. It is because they wanted me for my
  body and did not then know, as I had always hitherto kept it secret, that I
  was and still am almost purely a girl's girl. 
To work as hard as I had to get to the top, even with my brainpower, you do
  not have much time to think about sex. And, yes, I admit it right now, when
  I experienced that event in the country now called ****** I was still, at twenty-five,
  a virgin. 
I am sorry if all this sounds so angry; that is not the real me. It I just
  that I feel the need to put my case to you fully and forcefully, even though
  I trust you to have the right reaction to this. I just know that the lascivious
  view of my experience is not the one you will take. You are my judge and jury. 
At the end of this report I would only ask you to ask yourself if what happened
  to me was as entirely right and proper as I consider it to have been. I was
  fairly tried, fairly judged and justly and properly punished. That is my view
  now, just as it was my view at the time of the event. And that, I fully and
  firmly believe, will be your view too when I have finished putting my case
  to you.

Chapter 2 � Going to Court 
A girl and a one-third Negress, although from a well financed family background,
  can be expected to hold liberal views I suppose. At university I had studied
  geography and politics as well as law, and had acquired a confident speaking
  knowledge of three foreign languages too. 
Yet at twenty-five I was, I confess, a little na&iuml;f. I was wrong about
  many things. We all learn as we grow up. I was not fully-grown up when I was
  twenty-five. But I was not wrong about one thing. I knew I was being held back
  in my profession. I suspected I was being overlooked for further advancement
  because of my youth, my being a girl, and maybe, because of my light brown
  skin. 
Obviously I talked to my senior in chambers. She assured me it was not so.
  But of course she would. She had done alright for herself. She (Sonia *****)
  had got herself a permanent judge's post in a middle-eastern country, one of
  the very last outposts of the British Empire, and was about to fly out there. 
I had heard the talk that despite my youth my clear brilliance of mind must
  make me the leading candidate for her vacated place. Then they appointed Janine
  **** over me. I knew why they did it: Janine was a prosecutor in the same British
  colony our former senior was about to move out to. It was favouritism and nothing
  but. Janine was part time out there too. How could she hold down a job in London
  and keep flying out to *****? 
Okay, so Janine and I had been together the once: just the once. She had been
  my leader in a London court case before I decided to switch from prosecution
  to defence. I knew that she just could not keep her eyes off me. She had let
  me lead in court for some of the time and told me afterwards I had been brilliant:
  and she meant it. 
It was later in chambers when we were going over the case in readiness for
  the next day, when Janine had grasped me firmly around the waist, turned me
  gently but insistently to face her, and kissed me full long and hard on the
  mouth. I had just totally melted, my nipples peaked rock hard, my clit was
  dancing and throbbing and my girl-musk trickled uncontrollably into my semi-translucent
  tanga-panties, as I closed my eyes and surrendered. 
And yet when her hand was gliding up my mini-skirt onto the firm soft girl-muscular
  bare thigh-flesh above my stockings, I was able to break away and hold my hand
  up to beg her to stop what we both knew I wanted and needed. It was pure mind
  over body. I wanted advancement and to get to the top senior's post. 
I was hardly likely to get either if my present immediate senior and closest
  rival was known to be regularly stroking me. Janine stormed out on me hurling
  a frequent �bitch� as she stomped down the corridor whilst behind the slammed
  shut door I re-arranged by clothing, breathing deeply and literally watching
  the room go around and stars before my eyes, as my lust still had command over
  me. 
All the way home that evening I noticed, or thought I noticed, men taking
  even more interest in me than usual. I was used to them ogling me of course.
  I knew I was a head-turner. I was pleased to be pleasing. I was happy to be
  their erotic heaven on earth. Usually I pleased breast-men as much or more
  than I pleased leg men. 
My abundant heavy bosom was impossible to hide. I never indulged exposed cleavage.
  I always buttoned to the neck. Men adored my very evident hugeness. I smiled
  knowing they would be bowled over if they knew just how big and beautiful I
  really was. But that night on the subway was something different: could they
  smell the girl-musk saturating the gusset of the tiny white tanga-panties beneath
  my micro-miniskirt? 
Yet over the next year, as I equalled Janine in court status and began to
  overtake her in the prospect of the top job in chambers, Janine seemed to have
  forgiven and forgotten. Even so, a lot of people have said what happened next
  she engineered. I don't agree. I went of my own free will. 
Janine had already begun her visiting prosecutor role in this middle-eastern
  country. I had by then gone over to being a defence lawyer, still, at that
  stage, in England. Janine had regaled me with stories of the law in ***** where
  she now went from frequent time-to-time. 
Perhaps it was to raise my liberal hackles that she told me particularly about
  what the cheap newspapers dubbed �the sex courts�. You know the kind of thing
  where such so-called newspapers, whilst sounding-off self-righteously about
  how disgusting it is, print every last detail of what happens, because it is
  titillating and what their readers, people with equally double-standard minds,
  buy such disgusting rags to read. 
To someone trained as I was, in the western tradition of law, the practices
  in those courts did indeed seem almost wholly wrong. The fact that only girls
  could be tried for sex crimes angered me. 
But the fact they were tried only by girls, seemed a definite liberal plus.
  The law of that country was a strange mix of the new western-like add-on to
  old tribal-like customs. For all crimes the prosecuting counsel was safe. Yet,
  from tribal custom of obscure origin, for one crime at least it was the long
  established practice that in a losing case the defence counsel must suffer
  the punishment that would have been the fate of the defendant. 
No, it was more complicated than that. The girl found guilty was given the
  choice of taking the punishment herself or having her defence lawyer suffer
  it on her behalf. The reasoning behind this was that the crime in question
  was considered so heinous in tribal law that it was indefensible that anyone
  should try and defend a guilty girl. 
In other words, the loss of a case of this crime in court made the defence
  lawyer as guilty in the eyes of the law of that land as the girl defendant
  who had been found guilty. And the law made this abundantly clear by laying
  down, even before a case began, that either losing lawyer or guilty girl could
  suffer punishment for this crime, just to show that they were both equally
  guilty in the eyes of the law. It was termed in legal circles out there, �jeopardy
  transference�. 
The crime was lesbianism. The punishment to be suffered in a losing case by
  either guilty girl or girl-lawyer under the jeopardy transference law, was
  entirely at the choice of the judge in consultation with the prosecuting counsel
  and, if it were the defence lawyer that was to be punished, the losing defendant.

Chapter 3 � Trail and Outcome 
I know what you must be thinking; but I would hope that if nothing else you
  have clearly understood from what you have read so far, that I am no fool.
  I took up the defence of Hannah ***** because there was abundant evidence that
  she was not guilty, because she was a stunningly beautiful Jewess on trial
  in her adopted country, where anti-Semitism was known to be rife though hidden,
  because I was angered beyond measure that lesbianism should be regarded anywhere
  in the world as a crime and, above all, because I knew that the jeopardy transference
  law had not been put into practice for well over ten years by then. 
Okay, so I was exceedingly ambitious. I knew I would get nowhere if I stayed
  with my present chambers. I had my eye on moving to the top-notch chambers
  in London. Okay again, these chambers would practically never have heard of
  me, and okay once more, they had never yet had a girl lawyer on their books.
  I would make sure they had heard of me. The Hannah ***** case was even mentioned
  at the UN. If I could defend Hannah and win, the legal world would be at my
  feet sure enough, or so I thought. 
The judge would be my old former chambers head, Sonia *****. The prosecution
  would be headed by Janine *****. Where could I go wrong? With the UN pressure
  that nation's politicians were already berating their country's girl-police
  for bringing the case. And yet, the opposition in the country were pressing
  for the old laws to prevail. 
Behind the UN condemnation the opposition saw US and British interference.
  The opposition stirred up protest marches. They told the populace at large
  that foreigners were insulting the ethnic natives of the land and challenging
  their freedom to live in ways thousands of years older than the USA. 
The trial would be on television. Pictures of the event would be shown around
  the world. Television was not allowed in English courts, but the British High
  Commissioner found its employment in the courts of this last British colony
  a saving benefit. She did not need to post her personnel to report from the
  courts when the whole proceedings could be video taped from TV and flicked
  through at leisure later. 
As the time came for the trial, my fear grew that I had bitten off more than
  I had bargained for. The opposition stirred protests were rocking the stability
  of a weak British-imposed government. When that government reacted by assuring
  the public it would have no truck with foreign interference; when a new and
  extreme right-wing Minister for Legal Affairs was appointed; and when she confirmed
  the old laws would prevail and that, by the old laws she meant all the old
  laws, including the jeopardy transference law, I knew I was in potential deep
  trouble. 
And yet Hannah's trust in me had become total. I believed in her too, as much
  as she believed in me. I knew she had witnesses she was nowhere near the town
  where she was accused of having taken a bride to bed and deflowered her the
  night before the bride's wedding. 
The bride had not been prosecuted. She could not be. She had wed a man and
  since borne his child: a boy. That defined her in the law of this last British
  colony, as non-lesbian. But there had been gossip, and Hannah, the bride's
  former college lecturer, had been arrested by the girl-police and was now on
  trial for lesbian rape as well as being a lesbian per se. 
For the first time in my life I made a complete mess of matters in court.
  I made a bad start by ignoring Janine's clear advice to curb my style of dress.
  Janine and the judge wore ankle length unflattering shapeless black. I opted
  to show these backward stone-age thinkers what a lovely western girl could
  look like at her supreme best. I had the raw material in the outstanding loveliness
  of my face and body. I would show what a wonderful creature a girl is dressed
  at her sexiest. 
This was a hot country. I would have no truck with black. For my beautiful
  coffee-coloured flesh I would wear the supreme contrast of white. A girl's
  underwear is her own affair. That I might choose and did choose to wear a white
  G-string, white suspenders and white nylon stockings, with no brassiere, was
  my business and my business alone. I was sufficiently fond of men to adore
  always having my bum bare under my skirts jeans and dresses. 
I knew full-well what I did to men in the crowded London subway trains when
  they had to stand close up behind me smelling the fresh scented wonder of my
  abundant cascading brown curly hair, and feeling my gloriously firm round bum
  hemispheres pressing into their crutch and gyrating as the train moved and
  stopped and swayed. 
Many were the times I felt them getting an erection despite themselves. And
  many were the times I would turn my head to them and smile to say that it was
  alright for them to enjoy me. If only they had known that beneath my micro-miniskirt
  my bum was totally nude, just what might have been as I would purposely, as
  if unaware and innocent of what I was doing, press myself a little further
  back so that their cocks could enjoy my wonderful bum the more. 
That day that morning I rolled my white stockings up my extremely shapely
  legs attaching them to the suspenders. I loved suspenders too. I bought all
  my underwear from a special catalogue of erotic wear: �Exotic Erotic� it was
  titled. This particular garment had two suspenders at the front in the usual
  way, and two at the rear as was also standard. But the two at the rear were
  arranged so that they had to be stretched over my bare bottom. It was totally
  impractical of course; but totally sexy too. 
I had already decided on no brassier and a white blouse that would button
  up to my neck, a blouse with abundant lacy frills dangling over my pretty hands
  at its cuffs, and with a lacy flowery patterned bib atop my ample bosom. 
I finished with a white micro-miniskirt short enough to threaten to show my
  stocking tops at any time, and some white square-toed stilettos with three-inch
  heels. I brushed my fantastically abundant and near unruly brown curly hair
  and let it fall full length down my back to where it nearly touched my bottom. 
I was, I knew, totally devastating as I wiggled, my natural girl gate, into
  the court. But I was wrong. This style of dress was so wrong for the setting
  and the day and the importance of the trial. Disaster! 
I was to introduce the defence. The defence in a trial for lesbianism had
  to precede the prosecution case. The crime of lesbianism was, in this country,
  considered so foul, the prosecution must have the whole of the defence revealed
  to it and read all defence documents and interview all defence witnesses, before
  the prosecution took up its case. 
I was well rehearsed, bright and confident at the outset. But as I spoke I
  became aware that hardly anyone was listening to me. They, every woman in that
  court, were ogling me. The judge called the court to order. She apologised
  for interrupting me. She reminded the court that an extremely serious crime
  was being tried, and that the undoubted fact counsel for the defence has incredibly
  lovely legs was not to distract the court from its solemn duty. 
I thanked the judge, blushing deeply as I did so, at the realisation my thanks
  could be taken as being in response to the seeming complement about my indisputably
  superb legs, rather than for her bringing the court to order. I lost my place
  in my notes and began to lose face. 
My client smiled at me comfortingly, radiating her confidence in me, and I
  pulled myself together. But disaster followed disaster, Hannah's witnesses,
  Hannah's only real defence, had not turned up in court, and would not turn
  up in court. They had been frightened off by death threats from vicious right
  wing zealots. I had final confirmation of this from a court usherette whispering
  in my ear. The girl-police could find neither hide nor hair of them. I knew
  I could bluff no more. 
The defence was in ruin: total irreparable ruin. The ruin the zealots and
  the government of the country wanted the case to fall into. An example was
  needed to win over the people and prevent the government being overthrown by
  the opposition protests, the noise from which was a constant background to
  the proceedings in the courtroom that day. 
By contrast, all it took for the case to be proven against my client, was
  for a doctor to testify for the prosecution that Hannah, though twenty-two
  and married for five years had borne no child. This was damning evidence. Hannah
  must be lesbian if she could give her husband no child in over five years of
  marriage: that was the primitive way of thinking in this land. 
Of course judgement must go against Hannah. She was a political cause celebre
  in the land of her choice. The government of the day would lose power and the
  perks of power if it allowed the court to let Hannah off. The government in
  London were turning a blind eye. They let it be known that they would not interfere.
  (The colony had oil). I could not win this case. I knew it, Hannah finally
  knew it, and Sonia ***** sitting as the judge knew it. 
The judgement was a formality. I could see the look on Sonia's face. She knew
  she had no choice as the TV cameras moved in to show her in close-up and me
  with my head down in shame and fear. 
The continued lucrative business for foreign lawyers in these so-called sex-courts
  was also under threat that day. This last remaining colony of Britain might
  yet finally eject this one remaining vestige of direct rule from London. There
  would be unstoppable demands for native lawyers in all courts of the land unless
  the law were properly carried through there and then by these foreigners paid
  by the taxes of the country they were foreigners within. 
All I heard was the ending of Sonia's announcement: 
��..your defence lawyer, under the law of jeopardy transference is found equally
  guilty of lesbianism, and under that ancient and righteous law you, as the
  guilty party of the first part, have the right to accept the punishment or
  transfer the punishment to your equally guilty lawyer. Do you accept or transfer
  the punishment?� 
I cannot and do not blame Hannah for the word that echoed as much around my
  head as it did around the courtroom and every home in that land watching the
  TV pictures of the trial: �Transfer� said Hannah in a low whisper I only just
  heard. 
�Speak up� demanded Sonia as judge. 
�Transfer� said Hannah's sweet pretty girl-voice audibly this time, even though
  she lowered her head to avoid looking at where I stood. 
Sonia now turned to me: �As you have lost this case unreservedly deservedly,
  you have equal guilt with the guilty girl you chose of your own free will,
  so very unwisely, to defend. Your summary position is that of being guilty
  of lesbianism by default. Whether by default or by full guilt, the crime of
  lesbianism proven in this court is punishable only by the way laid down in
  the law of this land. Accordingly, it is my solemn and burdensome duty to order
  that you be taken from this court, shackled in the manner prescribed by time
  honoured custom, and thereafter forced to walk back to this court to hear your
  sentence and begin, immediately thereafter, your deserved just and righteous
  punishment.� 
Tears ran from the corners of my eyes as I listened to this; and yet there
  was a disturbing stirring in my quim. Incredibly, the thought of the brutality
  I knew was about to be visited upon me was turning me on sexually. 
�Have you anything to say before sentence preparation is carried out on you?� intoned
  Sonia's judgemental voice. 
�No ma'am� I answered obediently.

Chapter 4 � Preparation and Sentence 
I knew vaguely what was to immediately follow from what Janine had told me,
  and yet I made no protest as the two guardesses took my slender pretty wrists
  and let me from the court to a neighbouring room where for the next half hour
  the still assembled court would hear the muffled cries of my distress as I
  was made ready to go back before the court. 
More guardesses took charge of me in that anteroom, and their eagerness to
  get me naked marked them out as enthusiastic lesbians as I had been warned
  by Janine that they were. 
For the past ten years of leniency in the courts, sentenced lesbians had been
  required to work five years as prison guards in women's gaols without pay,
  and to train endlessly to ensure the perfection of their skills in girl-on-girl
  torture. Their alternative would have been to suffer the full rigour of the
  punishment usually meted out to lesbians, and no girl was going to choose that.
  For me though, there was to be no choice. 
These girls were not allowed to touch each other. If they, as sentenced lesbians,
  were ever caught doing so, they would be instantly beheaded. Prisoners though
  were fair game and I was being girlhandled lasciviously as the girls squabbled
  over the chance to feel my superb 38-inch E-cup firm bare coffee brown breasts.
  They were fascinated too by the huge nut-brown aureole surrounding my pert
  nipples: my �nigger nipples� as I heard one call them. 
�Get the slut in irons� came a commanding bark from a voice I recognised,
  as Janine entered the room. Janine, now carrying out her duty as the winning
  prosecutor, showed no sign of recognising me let alone of kindness or mercy
  as she witnessed the cruelties enacted upon me. 
Naked as the day I was born, I was taken to a chair and sat strapped firmly
  before a mirror where I could and would be forced to watch, as with electric
  shears they drove huge near nude highways through the glorious soft brown curls
  of my stunningly beautiful full-to-the-bottom-of-my-back length hair. 
My bottom-of the-back long sweet smelling wonderful dark brown curled hair
  was falling onto my back and my stupendous breasts like autumn leaves, as the
  leader among my torturesses gleefully ran the buzzing shears back and forth,
  back and forth and one side and then the other side of my head. I was being
  sheared bald as a mark of my guilt: as a mark of my lesbianism as confirmed
  by a court of law. 
Tears ran down my face and I sobbed audibly and inconsolably as my crowning
  glory was falling from my head all around me. Janine lifted my chin and made
  me look in the mirror as my head was now being lathered with soap in readiness
  for its final mocking shaving. 
A cutthroat razor was being stropped and another already honed to maximum
  sharpness was being drawn carefully across my scalp to ensure its absolute
  total final and full and complete and completely humiliating shaven baldness. 
Then they brushed me down of loose long fallen hair locks as I sat in the
  chair strapped at my wrists forced to look in the mirror at my eyebrows, the
  only hair left on my head, through the tears still welling in my eyes. 
I was next unbound from the chair and made to lie face down on a crude and
  dirty smelling straw-filled bed, as they held my arms to ensure I did not struggle
  when they fitted the torture irons to my feet. 
Janine made no move to save me from further humiliation as my eager torturesses
  ran their hands over my superb bottom and down the girlily muscular lengths
  of my very shapely legs. 
The first of the torture �irons�, made, in reality, of steel not iron, was
  a pair of seven-inch heels. Notice that they were �seven-inch heels�. There
  would be no shoe as such. 
Quite simply, starting with my right foot, my right foot's big toe was put
  through a one-inch long ring, like a short pipe. Attached to the back of that
  ring, was a circular tie-bar and a sprung-steel plate. 
Around my right ankle was tight strapped a three sided L shaped bracket. The
  three-sided L shaped bracket, or heel-plate, was of a size and shape to fit
  over and contain the heel of my foot. The strap around the ankle was of black
  leather and strong. 
In the process of fitting the heel-plate by its ankle strap to me, my torturess
  had passed the round tie bar running the length of the sole of my bare foot
  through a bracket at the bottom of the heel-plate for that purpose. 
The sprung-steel plate also now ran the length of the sole of my foot, from
  the ring around my toe to where the plate mated also with the heel-plate. In
  order to match my feet, my left foot was also now fitted with its toe ring
  with tie-bar, sprung-steel sole plate, and heel-plate with ankle strap. 
Starting once more with my right foot, the round tie-bar that now protruded
  through the bracket on my heel plate, had a screw thread along its protruding
  length and beyond. What followed next seems initially inelegant. 
A nut was fitted and turned round and down the tie-bar till it met with the
  bracket on the heel-plate. Thereafter, with the same treatment being meted
  out to my left foot to ensure evenness, the nut was tightened, latterly using
  a wrench. 
The tightening of the nut was performed with slow care and deliberation. It
  was obviously an activity my torturesses enjoyed. 
By tightening the nuts on the tie-bar they were, of course, bending my foot
  back by pulling hard and unmercifully on my big toes and bending the sprung-steel
  sole plate so that it forced by foot to take on the desired shape. They were
  arching my feet for a purpose: a cruel purpose: a painful purpose. 
They checked they had the angle of bend in my feet that they sought, by using
  a wooden pattern between my sprung-steel forced bent arches and the tie-bar.
  Once satisfied, my torturesses passed second nuts down the tie-bar to lock
  the first nuts in place. 
Thereafter, they fitted seven-inch cast steel stiletto heels to the remaining
  tie-bar protrusion. These screwed on like the nuts had before them. 
When fully on, the inelegant nuts were hidden within a recess in the heels.
  Two strong split-pins through each heel and the tie-bars on which they had
  been screwed, ensured the heel stayed straight. 
Even as I merely lay on my front on that dirty bed, being fitted with my torture
  irons, this bending back of my feet was more than merely uncomfortable and
  I cried out with cramps. 
By the putting of my big toes through the rings at the end of the tie-bars,
  and the tightening of the tie-bars and hence the sprung-steel plates very tightly,
  my pretty feet were pulled back hard back bent back curved back so that my
  big toes would go straight to ground when I was standing. 
I guessed the purpose of this. I guessed and I hoped and prayed I could withstand
  the pain when the time came. 
The irons were now in place on both my feet, as were the seven-inch stiletto
  heels that would run to ground a half-inch higher than my imprisoned big toes
  and only two-inches behind my big toes when I stood. 
Next, even before I stood, atop the straps that held my heel-brackets in place,
  my torturesses fitted a six-inch hobble to my shapely ankles. 
The hobble they were fitting was a six-inch ratchet hobble. This ratchet hobble
  would necessitate my walking at its cruel dictate, because it required the
  girl wearing it to walk by putting one foot fully directly in front of the
  other. 
Each anklet at the end of the hobble contained ratchets that only allowed
  the rigid straight bar between the girl's ankles to be taken one way. 
Starting for example with her right foot, she must advance that foot till
  she had it directly and precisely in front of her left foot because the ratchet
  would not allow her to move her right foot back, and nor would it allow her
  to advance her left foot, until her right foot was properly placed to release
  the ratchets and let the left foot be used. 
By properly placed meant the leading foot exactly in line in front of the
  trailing foot. 
The preparation of my feet and ankles was completed. 
They finished my binding in irons with two more devices. 
Around my neck they fitted a steel cangue, through which each of my slender
  wrists were also placed, so as to hold my arms up with my helpless hands out
  level with and just beyond my shoulders. 
Finally, they forced into my mouth an O-ring bit. It comprised a perfect circle �O� that
  was grooved like a gum-shield and curved slightly to the shape of my upper
  and lower teeth. 
It was fitted inside my mouth, behind my lips over my teeth, and then tied
  by two straps that came from the sides of the O, at the back of my head. 
It forced my mouth wide agape obscenely like that of a blow-up sex doll, though
  far more enticing and sexual. 
Its purpose was to hold my teeth from threat. It was to show that this convicted
  lesbian was under cure. It was to show that all three of my girl orifices,
  my cunt, my bum-hole, and my mouth, were available for a penis or penises:
  the only natural and right ways for a girl to be fucked. 
I was to be delesbianised by humiliation and pain. 
It was not to be my fate, but I knew that many native lesbians had been tortured
  as I was to be, and then made to serve a year or more as male fuck-toys in
  men's prisons. Tied all day with all three of their orifices being used at
  will for male relief to prevent homosexual practices in the men's gaols. Unlike
  lesbianism, gay male practices were not illegal in this country, though they
  were still frowned upon. 
My cunt became a little dampened at the thought of this, but all feeling of
  sexiness was about to be driven out of me by pain. I was ordered to stand. 
I was ordered to stand, and they turned me over on the bed and lifted me so
  my legs dangled off its bottom end. Then two of my torturesses held my elbows
  and lifted me to a standing position. 
The cries of my pain were heard in the courtroom. Tears trickled down Hannah's
  lovely face. Hannah was not free until she had witnessed my punishment. Hannah
  knew what had probably been done to me and why I was crying out. 
In the anteroom from the court chamber, I stood in agony. 
I stood on tiptoe. I stood on tiptoe forced by the legs irons. The tips of
  the toes I stood on were all but solely those of my big toes. 
I stood almost only on my big toes cruelly and savagely bent with the potentially
  bone-breaking weight of my wonderful girl-body crushing down hard on my bent
  forward big toes: my big toes tiptoed by the bending back of my feet: my big
  toes through their individual toe rings bent agonisingly, with the seven-inch
  heels at the back of my foot bending irons, tipping me forward onto my naked
  big toes with the full 115 pound weight of my delicious teetering girl-body. 
I swayed, unstable as I was steeple-legged in my seven-inch heels, knowing
  how I wanted to fall to take the weight off my poor toes, but not daring. My
  mind might be brilliant, but even a brilliant girl knows the blankness of agonising
  pain. My undoubtedly astoundingly brilliant mind was numb. My only thought
  was the pain from my big toes, which I thought must be broken, even though
  they in fact were not. 
As a girl with lovely legs I was, of course, used to wearing high heels to
  best display their erotic beauty. But never ever had I been in heels as high
  as these. And never, I must confess, never ever had my legs looked so powerfully
  wonderful. 
Despite or maybe even because of the pain in my crushed big toes as I stood
  my full girl-weight on them, the sexuality of my lovely legs being displayed
  on these seven-inch heels was undoubtedly arousing me sexually, and I began
  to feel a moistening in my girl-centre. 
And now I was to be made to walk. 
Wonderful rivulets of sweet smelling girl-sweat ran down my light brown perfect
  soft Negress' skin and stood in diamond shiny droplets on my bald shaven head
  and my pretty face. 
The ratchet hobble came into play now. I was being made unlesbianly male provoking
  by my tiptoed leggy stance, and now I was to be made to slink by the six-inch
  ankle ratchet hobble that demanded that I put one tiptoed foot absolutely directly
  in front of the other before it would release the other foot to move. 
The live male fuck-toy that was now me in my bondage irons, must agonisingly
  painfully slowly wiggle-slink her torture tiptoed way back into the courtroom
  before the TV cameras broadcasting to the whole nation on all 150 channels. 
I twisted and turned my gorgeous brown legs as I performed the tiny six-inch
  ballet steps that took one enormously strong orgasmically beautiful girl-thigh
  affront its equally magnificent twin. 
My superb stretched calves were superlatively erotic to behold, as I rotated
  my glorious bum, steepled on my crushed bent cruelly bent bare big toes taking
  all my 115 delicious and delightful pounds excruciatingly on each big toe in
  turn, as one of my wonderful brown girl-legs took its turn and then the other
  to advance my supreme girl-body, slowly to the courtroom to hear my sentence. 
My stupendously huge breasts were throughout this wiggle-slink-walk swaying
  and jiggling independently and then in unison freely and uncontrollably as
  I girl-swung along in agony on my crushed big toes. 
After an excruciating ten minutes slow ratchet enforced girly bum rotating
  extremely leggy ballet leggy wiggling slink, I at long last stood on my agonisingly
  bent crushed and bruised big toes, tilted forward unyieldingly on them by my
  seven-inch stiletto heels, to hear the judge's sentence through the extreme
  pain numbing my mind. 
�Sherrie Marie Nathan, you have, as prescribed by the law of the land, been
  male fantasyised as the opening of your lesson in the perils of the lesbianism
  for which you have attended trial and been found guilty by the ancient and
  righteous law of jeopardy transference, also known as choice of jeopardy.� My
  judge, Sonia *****, intoned�. 
�The only right and proper punishment for lesbianism in this country, has
  for too long now been held in abeyance.� 
�It is your good fortune, that the wise government of this present day, has
  chosen to reinstate the full force of the law, and that you therefore have
  the honour of being made an example to all girlhood of the fate that must befall
  all young women who indulge in the totally evil unnaturalness of lesbianism.� She
  continued. 
�In my view, this government is acting in the only responsible way and giving
  the world a lesson in how to stamp out an evil that threatens all girlhood,
  and by that fact manhood, and therefore the continued existence of the human
  species.� Sonia intoned. 
�Every girl has three wonderful orifices. Those orifices are for men and men
  alone.� 
�Nature has also provided you, Sherrie Marie, with a superbly provocative
  body.� 
�You stand before this court today self evidently a truly astonishingly beautiful
  girl.� 
�You have a very pretty face, lovely arms, breathtakingly strong and shapely
  legs, a gorgeous firm round bottom, a tight and no doubt warm and moist girl-centre,
  and the most incredibly large wonderful full firm and womanly breasts, topped
  by exquisite dark-brown nipples. And yet you have defended in this very court
  this very day the offer of this plus-perfect feminine female accomplishment
  for the sole use and pleasure of other girls.� 
I gasped with the pain from my poor crushed toes, but also from surprise pleasure
  because my clitoris was beginning to throb at this abusive tirade and at the
  knowledge of my helpless humiliating public torture bondage and being displayed
  to the world in total nakedness. 
Sonia all but hissed at me, sensing my arousal, I suspect, �Today in this
  court your hopeless defence was lost and entirely deservedly so, for lesbianism
  is in truth indefensible!� 
�For a girl as wonderfully and beautifully made as you are, the shame and
  the pain of having to punish you is all mine. Yet I have no choice other than
  to sentence you�. Sonia paused for effect���. 
�Sherrie Marie Nathan, it is the sentence of this court that you be driven
  from the spot on which you now stand to a place already readied for your punishment.� 
�You may not know what that punishment is to be. It is part of the suffering
  for all convicted lesbians that they be uniquely tortured. In your case, as
  is her right under the law of jeopardy transference, the girl that you so spectacularly
  unsuccessfully defended has made her choice from those I was prepared to offer.� 
�May you take your punishment like a girl�� 
��..Take her away.� 
Sherrie Finds Legal Loopholes 
By Eve Adorer 
Chapter 5 � Justice Is Served 
Even as I had enforcedly girlily wiggle slinked my tortured slow walk into
  the court I had noted with great care and concern that my two main guardesses
  were armed with three-foot long platted tapering black leather whips. Now these
  were uncurled and held ready to beat me should I resist going to my fate, whatever
  that fate might be. 
To walk in my seven-inch heels tipped forward onto my savagely bent big toes,
  the whole of my delectably feminine 115 pounds pressing unmercifully on my
  big toes, was absolutely excruciating. But would I resist, dare I resist? No
  I would not, dare not, and could not. The thought of being beaten with a whip
  on my totally naked flesh terrified and horrified me. 
The ratchet hobble holding my legs in an enforced six-inch step made me place
  one dainty tiptoed foot perfectly in front of the other so as to release the
  ratchet and allow my next step. It caused me to swing my bum and slink my legs
  toe-pointedly in male fantasyised eroticised pain. 
I was super-feminised thus as part of my delesbianisation. 
This tiptoe hip-swinging slink-stepping, went with my O-ring gagged mouth
  agape with my pretty pink tongue flicking invitingly, male sexually excitingly,
  in my concentration on my walking. 
The message from my O gagged mouth, the message it spoke without my being
  able too articulate a single intelligible word, so wide open was my mouth constantly
  held, was that this girl had all three of her delectable orifices open constantly
  for male pleasure. It metaphorically shouted to all the erect penises in the
  world: �deep shaft me�. 
I worked my delectably long pretty fingers as I slowly strode my long long
  leggy legged way to my fate. 
My arms were bent up so that my wrists were through the imprisoning cangue
  around my neck. The cangue held my chin up and gave even more emphasis to the
  pinkness of the tongue in my O gaped mouth, a bright pink that so contrasted
  with my light brown skin. 
My tongue was constantly flicking and telling thereby without talking, without
  being able to talk, of the deep pleasure I could give an erect&nbsp;cock forced
  its full male length chokingly down my helplessly open throat. It screamed
  my need to be filled with male seed, as did my swaying bum and the soft brown
  curly down surrounding my deliciously tight-lipped girl-centre. 
The TV crews were following my extremely slow wiggle-slink- walking progress
  out of the courtroom proper. Millions of TVs throughout the land showed my
  nude body glistening with girl-sweat. From my humiliatingly totally bald-shaven
  head down to my shapely ankles I shone with girl-dampness from the strain of
  my bondage and the heat of the TV lights. 
I slow-wiggled girlily into the neighbouring room to the courthouse now. This
  was not the room in which I had been bound in the irons I now wore, but another
  and far bigger place with a very high ceiling. 
Immediately I entered I saw that there was, not far from me now, a long, no,
  a very long ramp, rising from floor level to a height of what must surely be
  twenty feet from the ground. 
I flicked my head to rid the droplets of sweet girl-sweat bedewing my eyelids,
  so that I could see more clearly. 
Yes, this ramp ran in a rising curve to that twenty feet, and then there was
  a sheer drop like a cliff face in the middle of this huge and high room at
  the end of the ramp. 
The end of the ramp was akin to a high diving board at a swimming bath, in
  that it continued out beyond the main ramp, but unlike the main ramp had no
  steel pillars to support it. 
At either side of the �diving board� end of the ramp there were strong wooden
  uprights, like enormously tall soccer goalposts with a crossbar, but made of
  wood that was rough and ready as if not long since the tree it had been hewn
  from. 
The �diving board� at the end of the ramp was some six feet wide. These uprights
  rose more than my height above the end of the ramp, and stood rigidly firm
  and strong about ten feet apart and six feet forward of and away from the ramp's
  end. 
These strong thick wooden uprights were also buttressed by more tree trunk
  strong sloping supports, and the bases of the uprights and their supports were
  set in huge concrete blocks on the ground. 
The concrete setting, indeed the whole structure, suggested permanence. 
What on earth was this? What in heaven's name were they going to do to me
  to punish me? 
My superbly astute girlmind was whirring as I stepped onto the very beginning
  of the ramp and began my slow sexy girl wiggle bum rotating long leggy steeple
  legged slinky mechanical doll like walk up the ramp. 
My torturesses still held their whips at the ready. Despite my acknowledged
  brilliance, I could not even imagine what my fate was to be, all I knew as
  I supremely bum-swayingly advanced my super erotic way, all my superbly girly
  115 pounds on my numb crushed and black bruised big toes, was that I was nearing
  something, and that that something would undoubtedly be horrible. 
It took twenty-five minutes of my big toe crushing agonising wiggle-walking,
  to girl-wiggle-sway to the top of that ramp. 
I now stood at the edge of a huge diving-board-like precipice, twenty feet
  from the floor below. My lovely pink tongue licked around my dry lips sexually
  invitingly. My legs, my gorgeous legs, were shaking, not only with the strain
  of walking tiptoed by the irons and constrained by the six-inch ratchet hobble,
  but also with my mounting fear. 
There was a pause as cameras atop cranes with eager young girls girling them,
  were moved into precise position to give the millions of TV viewers a close-up
  view of me and what was to happen to me. 
Prosecuting counsel Janine was now alongside me. 
Janine was preparing to fit to me a series of white silk ropes. 
I was totally horrified. 
I could now see that from the top corners where the strong wooden uprights
  met the crossbar in the �soccer goal posts and crossbar� structure that stood
  six feet away from where I trembled with overwhelming fear, there ran two individual
  and separate white silk ropes that Janine now had in her hands, and those ropes
  ended, each of those ropes ended, both of these white silk ropes ended, in
  a noose!! 
Janine held in her hands, two individual white silk rope nooses. 
Even as I studied transfixed swaying on my tiptoes all but about to feint,
  I watched Janine skilfully and practicedly put the two nooses together. 
Each of the two nooses was tied exactly as you see in cowboy films. But at
  the bottom of each wide-open noose, there was a leather sleeve. Through these
  sleeves Janine slid a two-pronged forked wooden pin. The wooden pin held the
  bottoms of the two nooses together. The wooden pin had a metal hoop at its
  top: a hoop the purpose of which would be seen shortly. 
It was part of my torture to witness these final preparations so that my mind
  could fully absorb what was inescapably to be done to me. And so I watched
  with the fascination of horror, as Janine fitted two more short white silk
  ropes to the nooses. 
Then she made me ready. 
As matter of factly as if it were natural and done every day, completely coldly
  and unemotionally, Janine slipped each noose, joined and held together by the
  wooden pin at their bottom ends, individually over, one apiece over, each of
  my stupendous 38-inch E-cup breasts. 
I gasped with horror as I realised that what my mind was trying to deny could
  possibly be the case, was in fact what it had been decreed by the court must
  be done to me. 
Janine then drew the loose nooses down the full length of my gorgeous breasts
  until they were around the individual bases of my tits, with the wooden split-pin
  in my cleavage. 
Next she took the two ropes she had also fitted latterly to the nooses, around
  my back, and fitted them together too with a wooden split-pin so that they
  formed the equal of, and performed the function of, brassiere straps. 
I closed my girl-sweat bedewed eyes as I realised that I was now wearing what
  could only but only be defined as a noose-bra. 
When I opened my horrified eyes once more, two more ropes had been fitted
  in place. Both these ropes came down from the centre of the crossbar of what
  must now be called my gallows. These last two ropes were tied to the hoops
  in the tops of the wooden pins that held the nooses firmly to my chest, the
  pin in my cleavage and the pin below my shoulder blades at my back. 
The split-pin that was holding the nooses together at my front in my cleavage,
  and its sister at my rear holding the loose nooses close against my chest,
  were, of course only to supervene against the nooses themselves slipping from
  my body before they, the nooses, had had time to slip tight down and fully
  grip my breasts. 
Other than that, to the process that was to be performed on me these pins
  and the ropes like bra straps one pin presently held round my back, were superfluous. 
Hence the rings in the tops of these holding pins, and the ropes from the
  centre of the crossbar that would pull these pins out at the strategic time,
  to give the nooses the full cruel solemn duty of taking all the victims weight,
  without let hindrance or mercy for me, the poor victim. 
Of course I knew what was going to happen to me. 
The judge was by my side now and intoning solemnly: �Sherrie Marie Nathan,
  you have exactly one minute in which to voluntarily take the step to the painful
  and entirely deserved punishment that awaits you. If you do not take that step
  freely, you will be whipped until you choose to do so.� 
�No mercy will be shown you. One you have dropped, you will hang unmercifully
  for twenty-four hours. May your suffering fully and finally delesbianise you,
  and may you take your punishment like a girl.� 
I tried through my O gag to beg for mercy, but all I emitted was what sounded
  like a deeply sexy guttural moan. The next minute was the longest and shortest
  of my twenty-five years. I looked at the twenty feet below me and was terrified
  of the leap I knew I must take�� 
��And yet, and yet, and yet I took the leap!! 
I was not forced. Even before I knew it, I had stepped forward and stepped
  off that enormous precipice. I could not bear to have them whip me. 
My mind was coldly logical. I am a brilliantly super-intelligent girl. This
  was my fate. This was my punishment. I screamed as I stepped off the edge of
  the ramp. I stepped off with one&nbsp;foot only&nbsp;as if I had only half
  made up my mind, but my&nbsp;ankles were hobbled together and one must follow
  the other as night day. 
I leapt because I knew I must go and because my mind had told me it was better
  done quickly before I became a perfectly petrified, literally petrified, a
  frozen target for the repeated savage kisses of the brutal whips of my torturesses. 
Down and down I dropped sexy gorgeous strong divinely shapely curved and contoured
  girl-leg-kickingly screaming with my man-seed wanton pink tongue penis-erect
  from the middle of my forced O mouth as I screeched in my horror and total
  terror. 
Down and down I fell in seconds that were hours and days to the speeded up
  state of my girlmind. 
Down and down I plunged knowing that my fall would be broken, how my fall
  would be broken, and in abject total but total horror of what this would do
  to me, fearing, yes terrified, that it would rip my wonderful breasts from
  my body. 
From the TV camera standpoint it was all over so quickly. 
The ropes had been precisely measured. I plunged until reaching very near
  the ultimate end of the two nooses that lighteningly whipped themselves shut
  hard tight squeezingly tight brutally tight all but severingly tight around
  the bases of my breasts. 
A split-second after they had done so, I reached the depth in my fall where
  the ropes holding the wooden spilt-pins in my cleavage and at my back pulled
  those pins out, and I fell still further, suspended now only by my poor breasts
  inividually noosed. 
My tits were pulled up brutally hard and pulled out sideways savagely hard
  by my tit nooses, tied as my nooses were to the ten feet apart corners of my
  gallows. 
And then I bounced. I reached the end of my fall. I reached the end of my
  two tit nooses. 
The speed of my descent was taken to zero in a split second. The nooses had
  crush-squeezed down to near nothing the bases of my wonderful soft Negress
  brown girl-skinned orgasmically beautiful breasts. And now there were only
  two parts of my delectable female anatomy that could halt my plunge. 
I screamed as my tits were pulled viciously violently hard as they took the
  full 115 pounds of my feminine beauty and were stretched unbearably until my
  body bounced up; and then down; and then up; and then down at the end of the
  nooses; each time a little less high, but each time testing my full 115 pounds
  against the elasticity of my agonisingly tortured tits as I also swung back
  and forth and side to side hanging hung helplessly by my cruelly unmercifully
  tortured titties. 
I finally hung hanged. 
I was finally fully hanging only and entirely by my breasts. 
I was swinging helplessly screeching in my pain, pink tongue shooting out
  of O-gagged mouth. I was hanging by my tits. I was hanging fully and finally
  and only by my poor brutalised beautiful breasts. I was hanging by tits around
  the bases of which the nooses had pulled so unrelentingly tight that I was
  all but threatened with my gorgeous globes being severed from me. 
My lovely feet were three-feet from the ground. The whole weight of my wonderful
  woman's body was pulling on my tits. My tits were squeezed down so hard they
  were like enormous obscene light globes light bulbs. I was horrified to see
  that they had turned from brown-pink, to puce, to blue, and then to a purple-blue-black
  as my nooses strangled them. 
I was hanging by my breasts. My tits were pulled up so high I could see my
  nipples and my nipples stood rock hard and pointedly erect a bluer purpler
  black than my breasts themselves. 
I was hanging with all my weight suspended from my titties, my titties pulled
  up hard and high and hard and wide by my nooses as I still swung at the end
  of my nooses helplessly hopelessly tit-hung. 
I fought to free my wrists from my cangue to try and save my breasts. It was
  useless: I was helpless. All I succeeded in doing was to torture my titties
  the more as I swung and swayed and twisted, hanged by the nooses stretching
  my breasts hard up and hard out clear of my body. 
In my pain and distress I did not even notice that the palms of my lovely
  hands were bleeding from where I had made fists and dug in my fingernails in
  the extreme distress of my drop to the end of my nooses. 
My titties were stretched and pulled horrendously. Massive purple-black from
  their extreme strangulation they were pulled hard up and hard out with a 60
  degree angle between them as they stuck up and out from my chest and my body
  arched back from them. 
All my body weight was hanging from my poor strangled titties and even as
  I hung, I feared that my nooses were getting tighter still. 
The absolute horror of the fear that my breasts would be severed from me,
  drove my mind to near madness as did the truly terrible pain. 
In my extreme supreme girl-suffering, I uttered indecipherable cries for mercy
  and release from my O-gagged mouth. My sexy bright pink tongue was constantly
  flicking invitingly promising of the sexual pleasure it could yield, then and
  there, a throat-filling rigidly stiff penis. 
If anything, within but a short time of the horrendous drop from the ramp,
  my breasts had swollen even more from the already immense size they had instantly
  become from my initial hanging. 
I tried so hard not to move so as not to increase my already unbearable torture.
  But I had to breath and even my breathing moved my body, free hanging as it
  was, and even this little movement increased my pain. 
My lovely dark-brown eyes opened and closed. What were mere seconds to the
  on-looking witnesses of my just punishment were minutes to me and minutes agonising
  hours. I opened my eyes again only to see my nipples had peaked at a stupendous
  half-inch each in the middle of my now dark purple-black aureole. 
My eyes closed and opened blinking the girl-sweat from my eyelids, and I looked
  at the assembled witnesses of my punishment. 
Those that had been at the top of the ramp were now at floor level looking
  up at my tit hanged body arching achingly back from my pulled up and out titties.
  I lifted my head. My eyes looked out seeming not to see. But I did see. As
  I hung helpless with all my 115 delectable and exquisitely delightful girl-pounds
  suspended from my beautiful strangled breasts, I looked around with my pretty
  pain reflecting stunned brown eyes and I saw. 
What I saw and focused on was the delightful face of the lovely Hannah. Her
  face was so pretty as she smiled up at me. 
She smiled in part from relief that it was I who hung there by my strangled
  breasts suffering the punishment that she would have suffered but for legal
  loopholes. And I knew she smiled because she was sexually aroused to see my
  beautiful body totally naked being tortured so delectably and unrelentingly
  unmercifully. 
And as I drank in the delightful Hannah's pleasure at seeing me tortured,
  my own pleasure came suddenly upon me. The pain, the humiliation, the total
  and quite literal fall from grace I had endured and was enduring, and my mind
  reminding me I must suffer for twenty-four hours, began to arouse me sexually. 
I was becoming sexually aroused by my agony and my total helplessness and
  by the sadistic pleasure I was giving this lovely girl, the truly beautiful
  Hannah. My already distended nipples peaked and throbbed and hardened even
  more. My girl-purse shot full of my girl-juice, and it oozed abundantly from
  my girl-lips. And my delicious pink tongue flicked around and in and out of
  my O-gagged mouth as I stared wantingly at Hannah. 
And in my total agony why did I swing myself in my bonds to increase the pain;
  why were my helpless groans turning to deep animal moans; why was my clitoris
  wonderfully more rigid in my cunt than it had ever been before, and why was
  my clitoris throbbing and pleasure painfully pulsating; and why were my inner
  thighs glistening with my girl-juice, and why was my tongue, pink and sexy
  and sexual and demanding, licking my mouth lips and flicking to and fro showing
  my mind thoughts were wanton of the biggest cock in the world to be thrust
  unmercifully down my helpless throat so that it would choke me as it was its
  right to choke me, a mere girl, until it used me and throbbed and pulsed like
  my clitoris, until it streamed its male oyster into my body, the male oyster
  I needed deep down my throat, unmercifully hard up my arse, and savagely rapingly
  in my cunt, the man seed I would if allowed the honour savour and roll over
  and over on my tongue to taste its salt before I finally swallowed it delightedly
  into my delectable body��� 
����and away from the obsessive thoughts of my girl-blown mind, before the
  whole world watching me hanging by my poor tortured tits, and before my torturesses
  my judge and the prosecuting counsel, and before Hannah that I was taking this
  brutal punishment in the stead of, I helplessly wholly femininely and femalely
  orgasmed, screaming in girl-pleasure. 
I girl-orgasmed, girl-abandonedly, girl-uncontrollably, totally girl-wantonly,
  I girl-orgasmed and girl-screamed and girl-screeched and girl-orgasmed, dancing
  like a girl-dervish at the end of my tit-nooses hanged brutally savagely by
  my breasts mouthing with my gorgeous pink tongue flicking its tender tip in
  my O-gaped mouth as I stared longingly at the exquisite Hannah from my tit
  hung height, the inaudible words that burned my brain and tore my heart as
  I hung by my excruciatingly strangled breasts, my unmercifully tortured body
  only at the beginning of its twenty-four hours of being hung by its titties,
  I mouthed my desire and my longing for Hannah. 
As my O-gagged lips moved the little they could, and my sexily sexual moist
  pink tongue flickered to make my indecipherable words, only Hannah understood,
  only Hannah could hear what I was saying to her and her alone, her, Hannah:
  the most wonderful and beautiful creation in all the universe for me as I suffered
  for her, there and then hanging by my beautiful breasts that day, Hannah, deep
  blushing Hannah, the words, my words, her words from me, my gift to her, the
  only-and-the-all-gift I could give her, stark naked and breast-hung for her
  as I was, the words, the repeated words: 
�I love you!�. �I love you!� ����� 
Prosecuting counsel Janine then turned to Hannah: �What is she saying?� 
�Oh� said Hannah, with a sly half glance up at me, �She's saying, �whip me'!�
