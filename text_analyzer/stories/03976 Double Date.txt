&nbsp;

&quot;Say again?&quot;� His voice
was soft and teasing.

&nbsp;

She was clearly embarrassed.� She
looked down at her dessert

plate and said, almost in a whisper, &quot;Please.&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Say it again.&quot;� His
voice a bit more commanding.

&nbsp;

The small noises of the restaurant had faded completely behind

the rushing sound in her ears.

&nbsp;

She stared at her half empty plate and mumbled an

unconvincing, &quot;No.&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;No?&quot; he asked in a playful tone, knowing he'd tapped into a

most secret place.

&nbsp;

&quot;Not really,&quot; she said with a trembling voice, &quot;that is,
not

exactly.&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Explain.&quot; he said almost sweetly while increasing the tempo

of his finger movements through her now squishy flesh.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

They had met at a political fund-raiser.� Sarah was a beauty

from the local college.� She was
doing volunteer work for the

campaign.� Jason was a
donor.� He was tall, dark, and

handsome.� She was rather
surprised to discover how wealthy

he was.� He seemed rather young
to have so much money. 

She also thought he was a bit arrogant, if charming.� He asked

her out and she surprised herself by saying yes.

&nbsp;

Sarah was even more surprised that their first date had gone

so well.� He had been a perfect
gentleman and they'd had a

great time.� Within a month she
had shared his bed and was

again surprised to find he was an excellent lover.� She'd

somehow expected that with his good looks and money he'd

be a dud at lovemaking.

&nbsp;

Then the other shoe had dropped.�
On the third night, when

making love, Jason pulled some soft ropes out of nowhere and

asked if she'd like to 'play a little game.'

&nbsp;

She was very nervous; almost scared.�
But she also found --

and this was the greatest surprise of all -- she was

tremendously turned on by the idea.�
They played.� It was

great.� She wanted more.

&nbsp;

By the end of a few months their relationship had reached the

point where they were taking their sex games out in public.

&nbsp;

��������������������� *�� *�� * ��*�� *

&nbsp;

Dinner was at a very expensive and exclusive restaurant

overlooking the bay.� The
lighting was subdued, the mood

being set by moonlight reflected on the water and a small

candle flickering on the table.�
There was soft romantic music

playing in the background.

&nbsp;

The food had been sensational.�
The other diners were

absorbed with their own meals and conversations.� Jason's

fingers were gently sliding through the moist folds of Sarah's

womanhood under cover of the long tablecloth.� He had made

her come to dinner in an expensive evening gown and no

panties.� Soon after ordering he
had slid a hand under the table

and hiked her skirt up into her lap.�
He had been toying with

her privates and with her passions ever since.

&nbsp;

Then there had been those questions.�
Idle conversation when

anyone was within earshot punctuated with a whole series of

personal, confidential, and often embarrassing questions when

they were alone.� That was the
game.� 'Had she ever faked an

orgasm?'� 'How often?'� 'Why?'�
She was obligated to answer

truthfully and had been doing so.

&nbsp;

'Did she like giving head?'�
'What did she like best about it?' 

'What was she thinking that first time she asked him to do her

from the rear?'� That was a big
one.� She had always had a

strange curiosity about anal sex, but she'd never worked up

the nerve to ask any of her previous boyfriends to do it that

way.� With Jason it seemed an
easy and almost natural

request.� And it turned out to be
even better than she'd

imagined.

&nbsp;

'How long had she known she was a bottom?'� 'Why did she

like it so much?'� 'What did she
want to try that they hadn't

already done?'� She found,
without much surprise, that having

to answer these embarrassing questions in this public place

was turning her on tremendously.�
Her pussy had been slightly

moist when they'd started.� It
was quite damp now.� She was

afraid the back of her gown must be getting a wet spot and

worried it would show when she got up to leave.� She was

very grateful for the dim lighting.

&nbsp;

Then came the question she had been passionately dreading. 

It had really struck a nerve and she had done a miserable job

of trying to hide the fact.�
'Have you ever had sex with

another woman?'

&nbsp;

She had somehow known the question would be asked sooner

or later.� A part of her had
actually been looking forward to it.

&nbsp;

��������������������� *�� *��
*�� *�� *

&nbsp;

Jason knew early that he liked bondage and domination

games.� But finding playmates who
shared his passion wasn't

easy.� When he first started
dating he'd found only one.� Then

his father died and left him a large successful company and a

fortune in cash and stocks.� That
made things considerably

easier.� And he'd developed an
instinct.� Over time he'd

learned things to say and questions to ask when talking with

new girls.� More importantly,
he'd learned how to interpret

their answers.� Now about one of
every three girls he dated

ended up being added to the growing list in his little black

book.

&nbsp;

And being rich he wasn't obligated to play by the same rules

as, what his father had called, 'the little people.'� He wasn't

monogamous and didn't pretend to be.�
He was, in fact, very

truthful to his playmates about his other partners.� Those who

could live with it did so.� The
others left.� And still his list of

names grew.

&nbsp;

Sarah had been quite a find.� She
was a tall girl with a vaguely

middle-eastern look.� Something
in her shape and bearing

reminded one of a belly dancer.�
But her skin tones weren't

dark.� And her long wavy hair was
such a light brown it

almost looked blond.� All in all,
Jason thought she was quite

a treat.� And then to discover
her deep capacity for

submission.

&nbsp;

��������������������� *�� *��
*�� *�� *

&nbsp;

He thought about her non-answer as he continued to stroke

his finger over her clit.� Even
in the unclear light he could tell

she was blushing furiously.�
&quot;Go on, explain,&quot; he again

prompted.

&nbsp;

Sarah was stuck and knew it.�
&quot;I . . . That is, I've never

actually been with another woman.&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;But you think about it?&quot;

&nbsp;

She flushed even deeper and nodded her head.

&nbsp;

&quot;You think about it a lot.�
Don't you?&quot;

&nbsp;

Bingo!� He'd hit the mark.� Sarah, still looking down, closed

her eyes and said, &quot;Yes, sir.&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;My, my, my, . . . you like women,&quot; Jason mused, &quot;. . .
and

you like to be dominated.&quot;�
His finger slid across her engorged

clitoris as he spoke.� Sarah
unexpectedly tripped over the edge

and orgasmed right at the table, just as the waiter was walking

up with a carafe to freshen their coffee.

&nbsp;

&quot;Please pardon my friend,&quot; Jason explained, &quot;she has
asthma.&quot;

&nbsp;

��������������������� *�� *��
*�� *�� *

&nbsp;

Their lovemaking that night was the best ever.� There was an

intensity Sarah had never before experienced.

&nbsp;

Then she didn't hear from Jason for the next two weeks.� She

didn't know if she'd done something wrong.� If the whole

thing was over.� Or if he'd just
upped and died.

&nbsp;

She was moping around her dorm room one night when the

phone rang.

&nbsp;

&quot;Hello?&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Are you free Saturday night?&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Jason, where the hell have you been?&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Busy,&quot; he said brushing aside her question as well as her

implied question.� &quot;Are you
free this Saturday?&quot; he asked with

a little more iron in his voice.

&nbsp;

She was tempted to say 'No' just to get back at him for

leaving her hanging.� But instead
answered meekly.� &quot;Yes,

sir.&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Good.� My place, 6:45 pm
sharp, informal attire, but look

nice.� Eat a snack before you
come, dinner will be late.&quot;� He

paused.� She said nothing.� &quot;Oh yes,&quot; he continued, &quot;and don't

beat off between now and then.&quot;�
The phone went dead.

&nbsp;

Part of her was furious at this cavalier treatment.� But she was

also quite turned on by it.� Her
panties were very damp

indeed.� She hadn't felt like
having sex for over a week.� Now

she most certainly did.� But she
couldn't beat off for the next

five days.� Sarah felt like
howling in frustration.

&nbsp;

��������������������� *�� *��
*�� *�� *

&nbsp;

Jason lived alone in an impressive penthouse apartment in the

business district.� It wasn't
even a penthouse in the regular

sense.� That is, it wasn't part
of an apartment complex.� It had

started out as a temporary residence for his father, who quite

literally 'lived the business.'�
He had it set up using the entire

top floor of his corporate headquarters.

&nbsp;

When his father died, Jason made sure the company continued

to thrive.� Knowing he had no
head for business, he'd done a

good job of hiring excellent managers to run things.� Aside

from the occasional public event he was obligated to attend,

he stayed out of their way and let the cash roll in.� The

enterprise grew.� Soon the
corporate headquarters had moved

to a larger and more impressive building in a neighboring city. 

Jason expanded and converted the top two floors of the

building into a rather flamboyant bachelor's pad.� The 28th

floor he reserved as a buffer and a kind of storage facility

against his future needs.� The
rest of the building had been

converted to office space.

&nbsp;

All of which made for good neighbors.�
The building was

largely deserted nights and on weekends.

&nbsp;

There were security guards to guard his security.� There was

a maintenance crew to deal with maintenance.� And there was

a discreet cleaning lady who came three times a week to

straighten up, do laundry, and make sure the larder was well

stocked.

&nbsp;

All in all, it was an ideal life for a young, well-to-do, and

rather kinky man-about-town.

&nbsp;

��������������������� *�� *��
*�� *�� *

&nbsp;

Sarah arrived by taxi at the front door of the complex a bit

early.� The security guards knew
her face and let her in.� She

took the executive elevator up to the 29th floor and waited in

the anteroom, killing time and checking her wristwatch.� She

wasn't sure what this new game was, but Jason had said '6:45

sharp.'� Punctuality had become
an important part of their

game.� So she waited.� Before leaving her dorm she had called

and set her watch by the atomic clock in Washington.

&nbsp;

She fidgeted with her purse and waited some more.� At

precisely 6:44 and 50 seconds she walked to the apartment

door.� It opened even as she was
raising her hand to knock.

&nbsp;

Jason was dressed only in his black smoking jacket.� His hair

was slightly disheveled and to Sarah he looked positively

delicious.� Without saying a word
he took her in his arms,

pulled her close, and favored her with a long, luxurious kiss. 

She was almost breathless with lust when he broke off and

pulled back to look at her.

&nbsp;

&quot;You look fabulous,&quot; he said, and then added with a sly grin.


&quot;Are you ready for an adventure.&quot;

&nbsp;

Sarah didn't know quite how to respond.�
Her legs were

weak.� What did he have
planned?� She felt powerful jolts of

lust, fear, and curiosity.� She
suddenly found she couldn't

muster the will to speak.�
Instead she just looked at him with

all the emotions she was feeling playing clearly over her face.

&nbsp;

Jason studied her for a moment.�
&quot;I'll take that as a 'yes.'&quot;

Taking her hand, he walked her through the penthouse to a far

corner of the building.

&nbsp;

Sarah found herself entering a large unlit room.� She'd never

seen it before.� It was a den or
office of some kind.� There was

a massive desk lost in the gloom in one corner.� Wood

paneling covered the walls.� And
there was plenty of fine

conservative furniture scattered about.�
Jason led her to a

massive leather sofa facing a great glass window overlooking

the city.� The sun had just
set.� The view was magnificent. 

The city was starting to light up.�
The bay was still visible in

the distance.� A large yellow
moon was hanging overhead.

&nbsp;

Jason didn't stop to admire the view.�
He turned and gave

Sarah another long kiss.� Then he
reached down, grabbed the

bottom of her fuzzy turtleneck sweater and, as she raised her

arms, gently lifted it over her head.�
He kissed her again,

reached around, and unsnapped her bra.�
Removing the

garment, he leaned down and nuzzled and kissed her lovely

breasts.� Sarah's nipples were
rigid and hypersensitive.� She

trembled as he kissed her.� Then
she noticed a small pile of

bondage paraphernalia on the coffee table.� She trembled even

more.

&nbsp;

Sarah wanted to ask questions, but that wasn't the game.� And

she had to admit that the uncertainty was adding a tremendous

dash of excitement to the evening's mix.� What did he have

planned?� She was already moist
when he'd started undressing

her.� By the time she'd noticed
the bondage materials, she was

positively wet.� Her panties were
going to begin sticking to

her crotch if this went on for long.

&nbsp;

But Jason just kept kissing and licking and nibbling and

undressing her as he went.� He
got down on one knee and

carefully removed her sneakers and socks.� He undid her jeans

and slid them down as well.� The
panties were the last to go. 

He carelessly tossed her clothes onto the large leather chair.

&nbsp;

When Sarah was finally nude, he stood up and stepped back

to admire her.�
&quot;Superb,&quot; he said.� She
suddenly felt extremely

self-conscious and stifled an urge to cover her breasts and

crotch with her hands.

&nbsp;

Jason reached over to the table and removed a leather collar

from the pile.� He brought it up
and held it before her face so

that she could look at it.� There
was a brass plate with an

inscription she could just make out in the dim light.� It was her

name.� She didn't know what to
say.� So 'this' was what the

evening was about.

&nbsp;

Jason opened the collar and moved to put it around Sarah's

neck.� She helped him by pulling
her long hair up out of his

way.

&nbsp;

Once the collar was in place he kissed her again.� Then he

turned her around, facing away from him.� She heard him

reach down and pick up something else off the table.� She felt

her hands being cuffed together behind her back.� He stepped

up against her and reached around her taut body to massage

a breast with one hand and her twat with the other.� She could

feel the stiffness of his prick against her hands as he nuzzled

her ear.�� If he kept that up for
any length of time she would

come for sure.

&nbsp;

But he didn't keep it up.� Just
as she was about to grab his

member with her cuffed hands, he pulled away again and

moved her over to the sofa.� With
a little help (it was awkward

laying down with her hands cuffed behind her), he positioned

her so that she was lying on her belly on the sofa.

&nbsp;

Jason cuffed her ankles next.� He
used a short strap to tie her

wrist restraints to the ankle restraints.� He cinched them

tightly.� Not so tightly that it
was painful, but tight enough

that Sarah knew she wasn't going anywhere until he let her.

&nbsp;

Jason stepped back again to admire the view.�� &quot;Magnificent,&quot;

he said again.� &quot;Simply
marvelous.&quot;� Sarah felt very proud
to

hear him say that.� But she felt
more lustful than anything else. 

'OK,' she thought, 'he has me tied up.�
Now what?'

&nbsp;

The 'now what' turned out to be a gag.�
It was made of black

leather that almost seemed to match the sofa.� There was a

soft blunt penis prod on the inside that effectively filled her

mouth to capacity.� And once
strapped in place, it kept her

from saying anything or even from making very loud noises.

&nbsp;

And then nothing much happened at all.�
Jason sat on the floor

next to her and continued to kiss, lick, rub, and fondle her

body around the restraints.� But
Sarah sensed that he wasn't

going anywhere with it.� He was
just biding his time.� It was

highly erotic, but her curiosity was starting to drive her crazy.

&nbsp;

Then, as he was teasingly running one fingernail over her butt

coming tantalizingly close to her crotch, a little chime went off

that she never heard before.� She
turned her head and looked

at him.� He was glancing up at
the wall clock.� &quot;Right on

time,&quot; he said, almost to himself.

&nbsp;

Sarah grunted questioningly.� He
only smiled and continued

with his gentle fondling.� But
noticing her uneasiness he said,

&quot;The guards ring me to announce guests.&quot;� At this, Sarah

became quite distressed indeed.�
Somebody was coming up? 

Surely he wasn't going to let some stranger see her this way. 

She thrashed about and grunted objections into the gag.

&nbsp;

Jason just smiled again and gave her butt cheek a serious slap. 

It stung.� &quot;Quiet,&quot; he
said.� &quot;This is part of the
adventure.&quot;

&nbsp;

Sarah quieted but didn't lose any of her agitation.� She could

hear the elevator mechanism gently whirring in the

background.

&nbsp;

Jason again glanced at the clock and then stood up.� Leaning

over, he kissed her ear and whispered, &quot;Now don't go

anywhere.&quot;� And he was
gone.� Sarah was left to writhe in her

bondage.� This she did for just a
half minute.� Then, realizing

how hopeless that was, she got as quiet as possible and

listened intently.

&nbsp;

At first nothing.� The elevator
had stopped.� She looked up at

the clock.� 7:14 pm.� The second hand was coming up to 7:15. 

With 20 seconds to go there came a distant knock.� 'Hmmph'

Sarah thought with a vague sense of superiority 'whoever it is

didn't set his watch as accurately as she had.'

&nbsp;

A few seconds later she heard the front door open.� There was

a quiet muffled conversation.�
Try as she might, she couldn't

make out the words.� The voices
came closer, and Sarah

thought she would void her bladder on the nice leather sofa. 

But the voices turned aside and began ascending the stairs

before reaching her.

&nbsp;

She was breathing a sigh of relief when she heard the only

words she could make out.� It was
Jason saying, &quot;Are you

ready for an adventure?&quot;�
Then the voices were out of range

and try as she might, Sarah could hear no more.� She was left

trembling in her constraints.

&nbsp;

��������������������� *�� *��

&nbsp;

Jason met Daria in college.� He
was a junior and she was a

freshman.� She was the most
heartbreakingly beautiful girl he

had ever seen.� But when he
studied her face closely, he could

never understand why.� Nothing
seemed to match.� Her face

was almost square.� Her eyes
seemed too big and her

eyebrows too pronounced.� Her
nose was slightly upturned

and seemed the wrong shape for her face.� Her lower lip was

too thick and her upper lip too thin.�
Her mouth was crooked

and ears were too big.� There was
no reason to believe that all

these mismatched features put together would spell beauty. 

But they did.� She was absolutely
gorgeous and, not only

Jason, but everyone who saw her thought so.

&nbsp;

Daria had an equally lovely body.�
Just about average height,

she had a very athletic build and deep brown hair.� She also

had a set of rather impressive and very firm breasts.� Jason

also discovered she had a wonderful capacity for and interest

in sex.� And she loved to try new
things.

&nbsp;

Together they discovered bondage.�
This lasted until Jason's

graduation a year and a half later.�
Then Daria suddenly and

rather unexpectedly had gotten cold feet.� Jason was getting

a little too serious for her.�
She was afraid he might start

talking marriage.� And their sex
play was becoming more

intense all the time.� More
intense than she seemed ready for. 

One day, a few weeks before graduation, he'd asked if she

wanted him to take her to a sex club and put her on stage. 

That threw her for a bit of a loop.�
She said she'd think about

it.

&nbsp;

While she was thinking, Jason's father died very unexpectedly. 

First he was gone and when he returned he was busy.� They

hardly had time to speak during his final two weeks of classes

and examinations.� When he
graduated he left for good.� And

that seemed to be that.� Daria
did get one phone message from

him a few weeks later.� It was on
her answering machine with

his new number, but she never called back.

&nbsp;

In a fit of what was almost remorse, Daria went back to

vanilla sex.� For awhile she
didn't miss her wilder side.� She

told herself it was just a phase she had gone through.� She

joined the cheerleading team.� By
the time her own graduation

came up she'd met and gotten engaged to the star defensive

end.� Her life was starting to
develop in a very traditional way. 

And that might have been the end of that . . . .

&nbsp;

Except that one week before her wedding, she'd caught her

husband-to-be in bed . . . 

&nbsp;

. . . with another man.

&nbsp;

So the marriage was off.� At
first Daria didn't know if it was

the infidelity or the homosexuality that bothered her more. 

She just knew she was pissed.

&nbsp;

She got back in touch with Jason.�
She needed to talk with

someone and he was the obvious choice.�
But they hadn't

spoken in over two years.� The
number he'd left her didn't

work, so she looked him up through the alumni association. 

She sent him an Email and he sent an immediate and very

friendly reply.� They traded
recent histories.� He told her about

how busy he'd been since his father's death but didn't mention

anything about his new found wealth.�
She told him about her

broken engagement and he turned out to be a great listener. 

They went back to being good friends.�
But it was clear their

relationship wasn't about to pick up where it had left off.� A

distance remained between them.

&nbsp;

For the next several years they were Email friends only but

they shared a great many confidences.�
And largely through

their correspondence, Daria worked the anger out of her

system.� She came to understand
that the problem with her ex-

fiance had not been the homosexuality.�
It had been the

infidelity.� She knew this
because she began to realize she had

deep-seated bi-sexual feelings of her own.� 'Hmmmph.�
How

about that?'� She confided these
thoughts and feelings to

Jason even as they continued to live their separate lives.

&nbsp;

One day, the company Daria worked for folded.� Jason offered

to help her to find a new job.�
'Where did she want to live? 

He could find her a job almost anywhere.'� This seemed to be

an invitation to move closer to him if she wished.� They hadn't

seen each other or had a real-time phone conversation since

college.� She mulled it over for
a couple of days before

deciding.� Then she picked up the
phone and dialed.� It seemed

to break some kind of ice and they talked for hours.� In the

end she asked him to find her a job in the city where he was

living.� She would give it a try,
at least for a while.

&nbsp;

They went back to being close friends.�
But not bed partners. 

They continued to correspond by Email and talk on the phone. 

They would even get together now and then for dinner.� But

each seemed to be waiting for the other to make the first

move.� Perhaps this had to do
with Daria's confusion about

her sexual identity.� Since the
break up of her engagement,

she'd had several sex partners but they had all been men.� Yet

the knowledge of her sexual attraction to other women kept

gnawing at her.� She'd been
talking with Jason about this for

years.� Neither knew what it
might mean in terms of any

possible future relationship.

&nbsp;

Things might have stayed this way forever.� But then came

that fateful dinner with Sarah.�
Jason had several possible sex

partners in mind for a little manage a trois.� But Daria might

be perfect.� In fact, she might
be more than perfect.� Of

course, he might be risking their friendship.� Then again . . .

&nbsp;

He called her unexpectedly and told her he had something

extraordinary in mind.� He gave
her just enough hints to start

her juices flowing.� Was she
interested?� She spent almost a

week considering the implications.�


&nbsp;

Jason didn't pressure her at all.�
He just waited.� She called. 

'What exactly did he have in mind.'�
She could almost hear

him grinning over the phone.�
&quot;You'll just have to trust me,&quot;

he said.

&nbsp;

She spent a few more days agonizing about it before calling

back and saying, &quot;Yes.&quot;

&nbsp;

She could feel that grin over the phone again.� There were a

few long moments of silence.�
&quot;OK,&quot; he finally said, &quot;here's

the deal.� First thing, don't
beat off between now and then.&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;What?&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;You heard me.&quot;�
Another silent grin.� &quot;I want
you ripe and

ready for this little adventure.&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;And?&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;And I'll send you details once I have them.� Check your

Email.&quot;

&nbsp;

��������������������� *�� *��

&nbsp;

Sarah felt like she'd been lying there for hours.� But when she

heard the unmistakable sounds of returning footsteps she

glanced up at the clock and realized that it had only been

about twenty-five minutes.

&nbsp;

&quot;And how have we been?&quot; Jason asked as he entered the

darkened room.� &quot;Still
horny, I hope.&quot;

&nbsp;

Sarah started to protest into her gag but quickly gave that up

as futile.� Besides, the truth
was that she was indeed, still quite

horny.� Her mind had been running
circles trying to guess

what Jason was up to.� She hadn't
been able to understand

anything the guest had said.� But
unmistakably the voice was

soft and sexy and very feminine.

&nbsp;

Sarah thought about her last date with Jason and all of those

questions.� She remembered
especially those final questions

about her secret lusts.� And now
he had brought her here

along with another woman.� She
spent the whole time she was

alone working herself into a terrible state of erotic tension

pouring over the myriad possibilities of what the evening held

in store.� 'Yes,' she wanted to
tell him.� 'Yes, I have these

secret desires all the time.� But
I'm not sure I really want to do

anything about them.� At least
not yet.� I don't think I'm ready

for it.'

&nbsp;

Sarah felt Jason reach in between her bound legs.� In her

hogtie, her legs were splayed.�
She could actually hear the

moist squish that accompanied the feel of slick fingers easily

worming their way through her engorged flesh.

&nbsp;

'I'm not ready,' she thought furiously as he removed his

fingers and gave her butt a firm squeeze.

&nbsp;

&quot;It's playtime,&quot; he said, as he released the strap that held
her

hogtie.� Her legs flopped
down.� She wiggled her ass

impatiently.� She wanted him to
release the rest of her

bondage and take out the gag so they could talk about this. 

He undid her ankle restraints.�
She flexed her toes and waited

for him to undo her hands.

&nbsp;

Instead he merely clipped a leash to her collar and helped her

to unsteady feet.� He held her in
his arms, gag still in her

mouth, hands fettered behind her back, and kissed her on the

forehead.� When he pulled away,
she looked up into his face

with an expression that bespoke the powerful uncertainties

that were playing through her mind.

&nbsp;

'Please don't do this now,' she wanted to beg. 'Not now; not

yet.'

&nbsp;

But all she could do was to gently shake her head.� She felt his

fingers moving thorough her hot slit again.� He was kissing her

on the side of her face and around her ear.� &quot;Fun time,&quot; he

whispered.� And started off,
pulling her along by the leash. 

For a brief moment, she thought about resisting, but some

morbid fascination deep within her made her follow meekly in

his wake.

&nbsp;

She walked noiselessly, padding on bare feet through the silent

apartment, up the stairs, and down the long hall that led to his

large bedroom.� She had been
nervous the first time she'd

entered this inner lair.� Now she
was almost beside herself

with anxiety.� 'What was waiting
for her behind that door?'

&nbsp;

Jason stopped short of entering the room.� He dropped the

leash and turning took Sarah's face in his hands.� For a long

time he just looked at her, smiling gently into her eyes.� He

kissed the exposed flesh around her gag and then said, &quot;This

is for you, darling.&quot;

&nbsp;

She made a plaintive little whining noise behind the gag.

&nbsp;

He smiled.� &quot;I know.� But isn't it better this way?&quot;

&nbsp;

'Isn't what better which way?' she wondered as he took up

her leash again.� Turning he
opened the door.

&nbsp;

His bedroom was lit with the soft light of a half dozen candles.

&nbsp;

Jason took a couple of steps into the room and stopped. 

Sarah had followed directly behind so her view was blocked. 

She hesitated to look around him to see what was awaiting her

on the bed.� For long moments
nothing happened.� She heard

a muffled sound of movement.� A
little pause.� And then

another.� She could smell another
woman's perfume in the air. 

She found that and the flickering lights very disorienting.

&nbsp;

Finally screwing up her courage, Sarah took a deep breath and

peeked around Jason's broad shoulders.�
She felt a chill run

down her spine.� There was a
woman in the bed.� That was

hardly surprising.� But the woman
was completely naked and

tied down.� Sarah might have
expected it, but hadn't.

&nbsp;

At first, she couldn't see much detail.�
The woman was lying

on her back with her arms pulled straight up over her head. 

Her wrists were fastened together and a strap was pulling

them up to the center of the bed.�
Sarah could tell there was

a lot of tension on the strap because it was tugging at the

mattress as it disappeared over the edge.

&nbsp;

The woman's legs were cuffed at the ankles and there were

straps pulling each toward the nearest bedpost.� And because

Jason's bed was so wide, her legs were spread rather far apart. 

The effect was that her body formed a large letter 'A.'

&nbsp;

She took a step closer without realizing she had done so.� The

woman was wearing a gag identical to her own.� Sarah

worked her tongue around the thick penis prod invading her

mouth and imagined how she must feel.�
The woman's eyes

were following her over the gag.�
Her dark brown pubic patch

glistened moistly in reflected candlelight.

&nbsp;

Jason reached over, removed the leash, and put his finger

through the O-Ring in Sarah's collar.�
He pulled her closer so

the woman could get a better look at her.� &quot;Daria,&quot; he said,

&quot;this is Sarah.&quot;

&nbsp;

The woman looked but otherwise didn't react.

&nbsp;

&quot;Say hello to Sarah.&quot;

&nbsp;

The woman grunted something into her gag.� Jason stepped

behind Sarah and again wrapped his arms around her.� She felt

him firmly squeezing her in a big hug.�
His wrists crossed and

he grasped each of her lovely breasts with opposite hands. 

Sarah could feel his stiff member pressing up against her

fettered hands through the open front of his smoking jacket. 

She took hold of it almost for comfort.�
He nuzzled her neck

and spoke softly into her ear.�
&quot;Sarah, this is Daria.&quot;

&nbsp;

Sarah grunted her own hello.

&nbsp;

&quot;Good girl,&quot; he said.�
He then released her breasts and took

half a step back.� Reaching up he
unbuckled her gag, took it

out, and tossed it lightly aside.�
With the gag removed, Sarah

was free to speak.� She said
nothing.� She was suddenly, and

for no particular reason, keenly aware of the feel of the soft

carpet on her feet.

&nbsp;

Jason reached down and undid her fetters.� Sarah's hands fell

lightly to her sides.� She was
now completely naked and

unrestrained except for the collar.�
But she didn't move.� She

didn't know what to do or what Jason expected of her.

&nbsp;

The woman on the bed just watched them carefully.� She

didn't try to speak.� She wasn't
resisting.� She hardly moved. 

But there was an intensity in her eyes that Sarah couldn't miss. 

And unless it was a trick of the light the moistness of her

crotch had increased. 

&nbsp;

Jason came around and put his finger through her collar ring

again.� He pulled her gently to
the side of the bed.� They half

sat and half climbed up until they were quite close to the

bound girl.� He reached down and
squeezed one of Daria's

breasts.� She sighed into her
gag.

&nbsp;

Sarah didn't know what to do.�
She watched Jason's hand as

he worked Daria's breasts.� First
one, then the other. 

Squeezing, rubbing, scratching the skin lightly with his

fingertips, pinching her engorged nipples.� The dark skin

around her nipples was completely crinkled and almost seemed

to twitch at his touch.� Sarah
became fixated on what he was

doing.

&nbsp;

Jason reached over and took her hand.�
He brought it over to

Daria's nearest breast.� Sarah
felt her fingers come in contact

with the warm flesh.� They seemed
to tingle at the touch. 

Then his hand was gone.� She
watched it travel down the

woman's belly and slide through her pubic slit.

&nbsp;

Sarah heard a 'hummm' from the head of the bed.� She looked

up.� Daria had closed her eyes
and was quietly moaning. 

Looking down, Sarah realized that without quite being aware

of it, she had taken over pleasuring the woman's breasts.� This

went on for several minutes.

&nbsp;

Jason was doing something that was making Daria breathe

harder and faster.� But Sarah was
fascinated with watching her

own hands work the highly sensitive mammaries.� She

remembered the way she liked her own breasts fondled and

was using this to excite the woman.

&nbsp;

Somewhere in there, Jason stopped what he was doing and

got off the bed.� Now it was just
Sarah and Daria.� She

continued to manipulate the woman's breasts and only vaguely

wondered what would come next.�
Looking over she noticed

Daria watching her again.� Then
she felt Jason's hands on her

hips.

&nbsp;

Jason had removed his smoking jacket and come up behind

her.� Using his strong hands he
repositioned Sarah so that she

was face down on the bed with her head hovering over Daria's

closest breast.� He lay next to
her and gently pressed her head

until her lips were only inches away from the bound girl's

nipple.� Then he started rubbing
her back.

&nbsp;

Sarah felt his finger slide slowly down her spine and through

the crack in her behind.� She was
transfixed.� She looked

down at a gently heaving breast and up into Daria's eyes

gleaming back at her.� She looked
down at the breast again

and over at Jason's smiling face.�
He leaned forward and

kissed her.� Deeply and
tenderly.� When he broke off, he

reached up and took a fistful of her hair.� Using it like a

handle, he repositioned her face so that her lips were actually

making contact with Daria's nipple.

&nbsp;

Sarah closed her eyes and began to suck.

&nbsp;

She had fantasized about this for years.� A dark, deep, hidden

fantasy.� Now her relationship
with Jason had brought it into

reality.

&nbsp;

After a couple of minutes Sarah opened her eyes and really

started to get into it.� 'What
did she like?'� She brought her

hands up and grasped the nearest breast.� She squeezed it

rather hard to make the skin taut and sensitive.� She nibbled on

the nipple and swirled her tongue around it in lazy circles.� She

was gratified to hear the bound woman moan through her

nose. She inched forward and repeated the performance on the

other breast.

&nbsp;

For a while Jason continued to rub and tweak Sarah's behind

as he watched her.� Then he moved
back down between

Daria's legs and did something else that caused her to writhe

with pleasure.

&nbsp;

Jason let this build for a while.�
He randomly tickled and

prodded Daria's clit in preparation for what was to come.� He

wanted her at a high pitch of excitement.

&nbsp;

He watched Sarah as she increased the tempo of her lesbian

assault on Daria's breasts.� She
seemed more animated in her

lovemaking than he'd ever seen her.�
And he was learning

some new tricks by watching.� He
would certainly know more

about how to please Sarah in the future.� Meanwhile he was

keeping a careful eye on how turned on Daria was getting.� He

wanted her deeply aroused, but he wanted Sarah to be the one

to push her over the edge.� When
he judged the time was

right, he moved.

&nbsp;

Sarah felt hands on her hips again.�
She was pulled gently but

firmly back and away.� Next thing
she knew Jason pulled her

to her knees and then off of the bed and on to her feet.� He put

his finger back through her collar ring and walked her around

to the foot of the bed.

&nbsp;

Sarah found herself staring directly up between Daria's legs. 

The face hovering above those legs was again studying her

carefully.� But the bound girl's
chest was heaving with her

labored breathing and her nostrils were flaring.

&nbsp;

Jason moved around Sarah again.�
He hugged her tightly.� She

could feel his stiff prick wedged up against the crack in her

ass.� She suddenly wanted him to
enter her from behind as

much as she'd ever wanted anything sexual.� But he was

whispering in her ear again.

&nbsp;

&quot;OK, baby,&quot; he said.�
&quot;She's all yours.&quot;

&nbsp;

And then he simply released his hug and stepped back.

&nbsp;

Nothing.� For a long moment
nothing.� Sarah started to look

around to see what Jason was doing, but she felt his hand

come up and grasp her hair again.�
He positioned her head so

she was again facing directly toward the bound girl.� Then he

pushed her head slightly forward and pulled up so that her face

was angled down toward Daria's crotch.

&nbsp;

His hand withdrew.

&nbsp;

More nothing.� Sarah's heart was
beating wildly.� The girl on

the bed seemed frozen in place.

&nbsp;

And Sarah, hardly thinking about what she was doing, inched

forward.� She climbed slowly up
onto the bed between the

bound girl's knees.� She gently
grasped a thigh with each

hand.� She seemed drawn to
Daria's wet crotch.� The cunt lips

were splayed completely open.�
Her pubic thatch was either

neatly trimmed or it just grew very short. �The hair was fine

and very dark.�� Her moist skin
was almost sparkling in the

candlelight.� She could actually
see the girl's heartbeat in her

pussy.

&nbsp;

Sarah sat on the bed, leaned forward, and touched the

pulsating flesh.� She was
surprised to find it felt exactly like

her own.� She then wondered why
this should surprise her. 

She pressed the little hood back and looked at Daria's clit.� It

seemed rather large to her.� She
touched it with her finger. 

The bound woman almost jerked in response.� Sarah touched

it again.� And then began rubbing
two fingers in a gentle

circular motion as she did when fingering herself to orgasm.

&nbsp;

She heard Daria grunt and moan in response.� Looking up she

noticed the woman had again closed her eyes.

&nbsp;

For a long time nothing else happened.�
Sarah just kept

fingering Daria's clit and observing her reaction.� Then she

closed her own eyes and could almost feel how the bound

woman must feel.� Lying there,
completely restrained.� Her clit

being rubbed and teased continually.�
And she knew what she

wanted -- what Daria must want.�
Almost without thinking,

she repositioned herself and began licking at the swollen clit.

&nbsp;

At first she just dabbed at it with the tip of her tongue.� She

found that she liked the aroma and taste.� She was using one

hand up above to hold the clit open for easier access.� Her

other hand was pressed down beneath her, the fingertips

lightly touching the skin on Daria's ass.� But as the moments

passed, her tongue movements became longer and deeper. 

She felt her lips touching the warm wet flesh around the clit.

&nbsp;

Daria was moaning loudly now.

&nbsp;

Sarah quickened her movements.�
Her lips now covered the

entire area of Daria's upper pussy around the clit.� Sucking the

tasty flesh into her mouth, she squeezed her lips together.� The

little bulb popped up at the pressure.�
And Sarah started

licking and swiping at the hardened fleshy nub in earnest.� She

wasn't quite sure what she was doing.�
She just wanted it to

feel good.

&nbsp;

Sarah was also using her hands.�
She had moved one finger

into the bound woman's vagina and pushed in and out like a

penis.� Somehow it didn't feel
big enough, so she pulled it

back and replaced it with two fingers.�
That was better.� She

repositioned her mouth and tongue.�
Lubrication oozed

around her fingers and dripped down along the crack in

Daria's ass.� Sarah brought her
other hand around, slicked her

finger in the slimly goo, and then carefully inserted it into the

bound woman's anus.� She was
rewarded by hearing a great

sigh from above.� The twitching
and throbbing of the whole

crotch area seemed to increase.

&nbsp;

She started moving her finger in and out of Daria's rear hole

and felt delight in listening to the noises the bound woman was

making.� Sarah was getting
amazingly turned on herself.� Her

own crotch was incredibly wet.

&nbsp;

Daria was thrusting her pelvis against Sarah's mouth to bring

herself off.� Sarah was trying to
help her, but she must not be

doing something exactly right.�
As horny as the bound woman

seemed to be, she didn't seem to be any closer to coming.

&nbsp;

She felt Jason at her side again.�
He moved in and lay next to

her.� He grabbed her hair, pulled
her head gently away, and

took over licking Daria's twat.�
Sarah's fingers were still

buried in the bound woman's holes.�
Not knowing what else

to do, she kept up her stimulations.�
But the pitch of Daria's

excitement quickly elevated and Sarah could sense she was

getting very close, very fast.�
Jason obviously knew some

tricks she didn't.� Something in
the back of her head told her

she would have to find out what they were.

&nbsp;

Jason was still holding Sarah's hair when Daria made an

agonized moaning noise.� Quickly,
Jason pulled back, pressed

Sarah's face back into Daria's crotch and whispered, &quot;Finish

her quickly.� Lick hard and very
fast.&quot;

&nbsp;

Sarah did.� The bound form
started writhing with renewed

intensity and the moaning noises from above had turned into

hard quick grunts.� Daria was
virtually bucking her pelvis into

Sarah's mouth.� Jason had rolled
over onto Sarah's back and

slid his thick dick into her slippery cunt.� He was pumping in

rhythm with Daria's bucking.

&nbsp;

After only a couple minutes of this Sarah heard a kind of

shriek from above.� The pelvis
under her lips went stiff and

began lifting up off the bed.�
Daria was pushing herself as hard

as she could into Sarah's face.�
Sarah could feel the

contractions of the bound girl's orgasm through her lips and

fingers.� The prick inside her
just kept pumping and pumping. 

It was positively the most erotic moment Sarah had ever

known.� She experienced a small
orgasm of her own in

response.

&nbsp;

&quot;Keep licking,&quot; Jason whispered into her ear, &quot;but
gently.&quot; 

Sarah knew exactly what he meant.�
She knew how nice it was

when Jason would continue softly licking around her clit

without actually touching it after she had come.� She did this

for Daria and heard a moan of contentment from above.

&nbsp;

She felt Jason ease himself out of her and get up. After a

while, Sarah stopped licking.�
She pulled her face back and

looked down.� She had never
looked at another woman's

anatomy that closely before.� The
light was dim, but her eyes

were adjusted.� It was hard to
see much detail in the flickering

candlelight, but she found herself powerfully aroused at what

she saw.

&nbsp;

Jason was making little noises around the room but she hardly

gave him any notice.

&nbsp;

Sarah turned her head and pressed her cheek against the

warm, moist hair.� She used
Daria's pubic mound as a kind of

pillow and started thinking about what had just happened.� For

a long while her face remained blank as she tried to collect her

thoughts and sort out her feelings.�
Then she smiled.

&nbsp;

She felt Jason's hands return to her hips.� He pulled her back

down toward the foot of the bed.�
He stood her up, positioned

her so that she was facing Daria, and refastened her wrists

behind her back.

&nbsp;

So it wasn't over yet.

&nbsp;

She looked again at the wet crotch below her and then up into

the flushed face near the head of the bed.� Daria's gag had

been removed and her breathing was returning to normal. 

Sarah felt a powerfully renewed lust at the sight.� Of course it

wasn't over.� She hadn't really
come yet, and neither had

Jason.

������������������� 

When he was finished with her hands, he turned her around

and kissed her fiercely.� She
felt herself melting into him.

&nbsp;

&quot;You were great,&quot; he finally said when they had broken off
the

kiss.� She didn't know what to
say in reply, so remained silent. 

&quot;Did you enjoy that?&quot; he asked.

&nbsp;

It was like the restaurant all over again.� She lowered her eyes

and nodded in the affirmative.�
Jason saw a small smile playing

across her lips.

&nbsp;

He reached down and picked up her gag which was lying by

the foot of the bed.� &quot;Open.&quot;� She did.�
He fastened the gag in

place and then put his finger through the O-Ring of her collar. 

She looked up into his face.�
Giving her a small peck on her

forehead, he stepped right up onto the bed and half-led, half-

pulled Sarah with him.� She found
herself standing between

Daria's legs again looking down at her.�
Daria seemed quite

alert and even though her mouth was ungagged she said

nothing.

&nbsp;

Jason walked Sarah up to the head of the bed, right over the

prone body.� She had to be careful
how she moved so as not

to trip over the girl or step on her.�
He positioned her so that

she was standing directly over Daria's head.� One foot on each

side.� She looked down past her
own breasts and belly into the

bound girl's eyes.� They seemed
to be looking intensely up at

her crotch.� Jason pulled down on
the ring and helped Sarah

get to her knees.� She could feel
Daria's flesh against the sides

of her legs and the soles of her feet.

&nbsp;

She looked down and could only see Daria's bound arms

pulled up in front of her.� She
looked over at Jason.� 'Now

what?' she asked with her eyes.

&nbsp;

&quot;Now it's your turn,&quot; he said in answer to her unspoken

question.

&nbsp;

Sarah's mind was racing.� She
took in a deep breath through

her nose and tried to stop thinking about it.� She carefully

readjusted her position and gently lowered herself until she

could feel Daria's hot breath on her pubic hair.� Slowly she

continued to inch her body downward.

&nbsp;

And then, quite suddenly, she felt Daria's warm mouth and

tongue attack her pussy.

&nbsp;

Daria wasn't being the least bit timid.�
She seemed to know

exactly what she wanted and was going after it with a ferocity

that disconcerted Sarah.� Her
tongue was a blur of pressure

and motion.� Her mouth was
sliding across Sarah's pussy flesh

causing the muscles in the kneeling girl's thighs to begin

trembling.

&nbsp;

This was incredible.� Perhaps it
was the softness of her face. 

Perhaps it was some hidden knowledge that only women

possess.� Perhaps it was Sarah's
own reaction to being licked

by another woman for the very first time.� But the feelings

running through her were amazing.

&nbsp;

She could feel the bound girl's breasts and tight nipples

pressing up against her butt cheeks as she was being licked. 

Sarah hung her head and breathed heavily through her nose. 

The gag caused her to take quick shallow breaths and the lack

of oxygen seemed to be intensifying her passion.� She was

making rhythmic moaning noises as the waves of pleasure

washed over her. 

&nbsp;

Sarah felt Jason reach over and fondle her breast while she

was being eaten by Daria.� His
touch was incredibly intense. 

She felt his palm press firmly against her nipple.� Then his

fingers pinched her hard, rosy bud.�
She moaned even louder

from the pleasure and delighted even more in the feel of the

busy mouth working on her sopping pussy.� The hand on her

breast withdrew.

&nbsp;

Before Jason, Sarah had only been given head by one other

boyfriend and he didn't really know what he was doing.� Jason

had been the best.� But this was
so much better than even that. 

Sarah found herself twitching and bobbing from side to side in

rhythm with Daria's tongue.� This
went on for many delightful

minutes.

&nbsp;

Then Sarah started getting close.�
She almost wanted to rear

up and slow things down.� To draw
out the pleasure.� But

Daria's tongue was insistent.�
And the bound girl under her

was making grunting noises as she labored to breathe while

pleasuring the girl perched on her face.

&nbsp;

Sarah started making her own grunting noises through the gag

as her orgasm approached.� Daria
sensing this clamped down

on the skin above and below Sarah's clit with her lips and

pressed tightly.� She thrashed
the little bulb lustily with her

tongue.

&nbsp;

Sarah came rather suddenly.� She
made a loud whining noise

through her nose and reared up off of Daria's face.� She was

climaxing wildly and the intensity had gotten to her.� Daria

craned her neck to reach up after the retreating pussy.� But the

distance was too great and she gave up.�
Letting her head fall

back she enjoyed the wonderful passionate noises that Sarah

was making and the sight of the trembling crotch hovering

over her.� She found the tuft of
light brown hair fascinating as

it glistened wetly and quivered.

&nbsp;

Jason pulled Sarah up and off to one side, laying her face

down on the bed along side Daria.

&nbsp;

A little earlier, when he'd finished fondling Sarah's breast,

Jason had again gone down between Daria's legs.� He started

carefully and gently licking her towards another climax.� By

the time Sarah had come, Daria was close too.� But he

wouldn't push her over the edge until after Sarah had finished. 

Then when it happened he hadn't finished her off right away. 

Instead he moved up quickly and pulled Sarah off.

&nbsp;

Then, while Sarah lay panting on her belly and coming down

off of the climax, Jason hurried back and licked Daria a little

more until she was right on the edge of a second tremendous

release.� When she was quite
close, he scooched up and

plunged himself into her sodden pussy, grinding his own pelvis

into hers and driving her over the precipice to another jarring

climax.

&nbsp;

Daria quite literally screamed with pleasure.� Sarah turned her

head at the sound and watched her come.�
She was amazed

how beautiful the bound girl looked while in the throes of her

orgasm.� And for a moment Sarah
thought that was the end of

it.� But it wasn't.� Jason, wasn't quite done.

&nbsp;

Now it was his turn.� But rather
than come in Daria, he gave

her a couple of last minute pumps and a long romantic kiss. 

Then he quickly withdrew.

&nbsp;

Moving over to Sarah he spread her legs and took her doggie

style for a little while.� The
feel of his balls slapping up against

her supersensitive pussy was making her ready for another

orgasm.� He stopped for a while
and reaching down played

with her clit in a way he'd never done before.� She found

herself ready to come again in surprisingly short order.

&nbsp;

When he felt she was quite close, he removed his hand and

carefully pressed his dick into Sarah's rear hole.� She could

feel the bulbous head of his prick slide into and past her

sphincter.� She loved that.� And of course she'd never had

anything like it under these circumstances.� It only took a half

dozen firm pumps before Sarah screamed into her gag for a

second time.� And with a few
additional pumps Jason shot his

load into her firm, round ass.

&nbsp;

After that, the only sound heard was heavy breathing all

around.� For a long, long time no
one moved.� They were all

exhausted and glowing.

&nbsp;

Eventually Jason got up.� Gently
pulling Sarah to her feet, he

released all her restraints including the collar.� Then he

climbed onto the bed and did the same for Daria.� Sarah stood

dumbly, not knowing what to do, as Jason worked the knots

on the soft ropes.� Once both
girls were completely free and

naked, he strolled off to the bathroom to fetch some warm

washcloths.

&nbsp;

There was an awkward moment when the two girls found

themselves alone in the big room.�
Daria took the initiative

and, climbing out of bed, walked up to the taller girl.� She

looked directly into her eyes and studied her face as if she

were trying to fathom something.�
Sarah didn't know what to

say or do, so she simply stood there with her hands hanging

limply at her sides.

&nbsp;

Daria took Sarah's face in her hands.�
Pulling her face down

she kissed her full on the mouth.�
It wasn't a heated passionate

kiss, but a tender romantic one.�
Romantic, but there were

tongues and some heavy breathing involved before it was

over.� Then Daria released
Sarah's face and said, &quot;Thank you. 

That was fine.&quot;

&nbsp;

In a weird way, Sarah felt proud.�
And this went beyond just

pleasing Jason.� Somehow Daria's
approval unleashed an inner

pleasure she had never suspected existed.

&nbsp;

��������������������� *�� *��
*�� *�� *

&nbsp;

After they'd mopped up a bit, Jason suggested they take a

little nap before showering and heading out for a late supper. 

Both girls enthusiastically agreed.�
So he set an alarm and they

all lay down together.

&nbsp;

Jason was in the middle.� Sarah
was nestled up against him on

one side, already asleep.� Daria
was lying on his other side. 

She was facing him and toying with his chest hair thoughtfully. 

His eyes were closed but he wasn't yet asleep.� Daria's eyes

were open.

&nbsp;

&quot;That was really nice,&quot; she said quietly.

&nbsp;

&quot;Hmmm,&quot; he responded with a more-or-less affirmative tone.

&nbsp;

&quot;Pretty pleased with yourself, aren't you?&quot;

&nbsp;

He favored her with another 'hmmm'ing noise.� This one

sounded almost smug.

&nbsp;

She reached down and took his now lax prick in her hand. 

&quot;Good dog,&quot; she said.

&nbsp;

He chuckled.

&nbsp;

&quot;Next time, . . .&quot; she said and didn't finish the thought.

&nbsp;

&quot;Hmmmm?&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Next time,&quot; she said, &quot;I want to run the
show.&quot;� She gave his

prick a little squeeze and watched as it half inflated.

&nbsp;

&quot;Next time?&quot; he half mumbled.

&nbsp;

&quot;You know what I mean,&quot; she said, rubbing his member so

that it started to come more fully to life.� He good-naturedly

swatted her hand away.� He'd had
enough for one night. 

Daria smiled to herself and thought, 'last one standing.'� She

continued, &quot;I want to sit naked in that big chair in the corner

and have Sarah on her knees before me licking my twat.&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Hmmmm.&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;I want her cuffed and collared.�
I want to hold her leash and

call the shots.&quot;� She
brought her hand back up to his chest. 

&quot;What do you think?&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Hmmmm,&quot; he said.�
&quot;We'll see.&quot;� He yawned
and then said,

as if to end the conversation, &quot;We'll have to see how Sarah

feels about that.&quot;

&nbsp;

That was good enough for Daria.�
She whispered, &quot;Go to

sleep.&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Mmmmmm,&quot; Jason agreed.�
It had been one hell of a double

date.

&nbsp;

Daria was sure there would be a next time and that she'd get

her way.� She propped herself up
on one elbow to look at

Sarah.� 'Beautiful' she thought.� She imagined that mouth

totally at her command and felt a small sexual rush at the

thought.� Reaching over Jason,
she took one of Sarah's

nipples between her fingers and watched as the luscious bud

inflated.� The feel of the now
rigid flesh on her fingertips was

delightful.

&nbsp;

Sarah moaned softly but showed no signs of waking.

&nbsp;

Daria lay back and settled down to sleep.� But she maintained

a tender grip on Sarah's nipple.�
She played with it idly as she

drifted off.� 'Next time,' she
thought to herself.� 'Next time.'
