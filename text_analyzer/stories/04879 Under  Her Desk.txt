Under Her Desk

&nbsp;

It all started when I got a new job at
the Hathaway Corporation.� I�d just
graduated and now held a doctorate as well as my first degree.� I was pleased with my new position as Head of
IT at this large PR company.� It had
taken me a long time to find a decent job and I had finally come out to
Southampton in Connecticut.� It had taken
all my savings to set myself with a small flat in downtown Southampton but I
was determined to succeed.� I was almost
fifty and had been divorced for some years.�
Before my divorce I had lost my job (which is why my wife had divorced
me) and I had thought I would never find another � my age being against
me.� Anyway at forty-five I went back to
college and some years later, armed with a doctorate, found myself being
interviewed by Diane Hathaway, the Head of the Corporation.

��������� Diane Hathaway was in
her early thirties and was probably the most gorgeous woman I had ever
seen.� She had long dark hair, wide green
almond eyes and a body that no words could do justice to.� When she stood and welcomed me at the
interview I noticed that her black dress was very short, shorter indeed than
those of any of the secretaries I had passed on my journey to her office.� Her long, lip-smacking legs were encased in
sheer black stockings and her feet thrust into a pair of black high-heeled
shoes.� Her voice was soft and mellow as
she introduced herself.� She returned to
her desk and sadly her legs went out of sight.

��������� The interview seemed to
go faultlessly although she had a habit of staring at me that made me
uncomfortable, as though she were able to look into my brain and see what made
me tick.� I was ashamed too, that� I had had no money to buy new clothes and had
turned up for the interview in a pair of old, rather tight jeans.

��������� As I say I started to
get the picture of things on my first day.�
I was told Diane Hathaway wanted to see when I got in, the first
morning.� (I ought to mention here that,
despite my age, I had always kept myself in pretty good condition, working out
at least three times a week.)� I had on a
brand new suit, bought with an advance on my salary, and was feeling rather
pleased with myself as I strode in Diane�s office, her secretary having let me
in.� A large conference table stretched
out from her desk and, as Diane was busy on the phone, I nodded to her and sat
down by her desk.� 

��������� Immediately her eyes
snapped open at me.� She took the phone
away from her mouth.

��������� �Did I say you could
sit?�� Her voice was still soft but there
was no mistaking the iron edge.

��������� �N-no,� I stammered,
frozen to the spot.

��������� �Well get the fuck out
of that seat then.�� I jumped up, my
heart beating.� Diane returned to her
phone conversation.� She laughed at
something and said:

��������� �Yeah, he�s just a new
guy.�� Her conversation became then
meaningless.� After a few minutes I was
becoming a little irritated.� She swung
her legs onto her desk and twisted her feet as she talked, as if she were
looking for blemishes on her shoes, although I couldn�t see any.� After another ten minutes she put the phone
down and looked up at me.

��������� �What are you doing with
that suit?�

��������� I was shocked by the
tone of anger in her voice.

��������� �I thought as Head of IT
I should look the part - .�

�Listen, David.� Why do you think you got this job?� Did you think it was because of your pitiful
doctorate?� You turned up for the
interview in a pair of jeans.� Tight
jeans.� You were the only one who did.� Well, I liked the look of your butt.� That�s why you go the job.� You�ve got a cute butt.� I prefer to have older men around too � that
was another point on your favour.� They
are often more sensitive to a woman�s needs.�
What a combination � an older man with a cute butt.� I wasn�t going to pass that up.� You looked moderately capable so you go the
job.�� She stood up, came round the desk
and faced me.� At five foot ten inches
she was about my height, in her heels.�
�It comes down to this Dave.� Get
rid of that suit and get yourself a pair of jeans.� And I mean tight jeans.� I want to see your butt nice and clear.� You want this job, don�t you?�

I nodded mutely not knowing what to say.� Of course I wanted this job where would I get
another?

�Well get off right now and buy yourself a
pair of tight jeans.� Report back to me
and let me see them.� If they�re not
tight enough you�ll be out on your cute little butt.� Have you got that?�

I stared at her, my head in a whirl.� Suddenly she placed her hand on the front of
my trousers, grabbed my balls and held on tightly.� I yelped.

�And in case you�ve got any ideas about
yelling �sexual harassment� I know some bouncers who owe me a favour, so you�ll
be yelling �sexual harassment� from a hospital bed, that is when you�re able to
yell.�� She removed her hand and pointed
to the door.� �Now get out and get busy.�

I almost ran from her room and once outside
stood wondering where to go.� I guess I
wasn�t thinking clearly, I only knew I had to find a jeans shop.� Diane�s secretary gave me directions.� Having found the shop I tried on various
jeans, worried that Diane would not find them tight enough.� I ended up in a pair I could hardly breathe
in but I reckoned they would do the job.

I carried my suit back to office in a plastic
bag and stowed in beneath my desk.� With
my heart beating I turned up outside Diane�s office.� I had been waiting ten minutes when her door
suddenly flew open and she came walking rapidly.

�Debbie�, she said to her secretary.� �My lunch appointment may go on for longer
than I planned.� Can you rearrange my two
o� clock?�� Then she noticed me.� �Well Dave stand up and let me see you.�� I did as she asked.� �Turn around!� she snapped.� �Do I have to tell you to do
everything?�� I spun round feeling
horribly embarrassed in front of Debbie.�
�Well, Dave, you�ve done alright in those jeans.� Make sure you wear those jeans every day.� Now tonight,� she continued, �there�s a
reception I have to attend and I thought it would be useful for you to come
too.� We�ll go straight from here so come
along to my office at about six.� No
earlier, no later.� Go that?�

I nodded.�
She didn�t seem to care that I might have had another appointment.� It was just as well I didn�t.

As the afternoon drew on I became
increasingly anxious.� I needed this
job.� I wouldn�t do anything that would
screw it up.� If she wanted me to come
along to a reception with her I�d go.� It
shouldn�t be so bad � she was a beautiful, sexy woman.� She knew how to dress, how to talk.� What was I worrying about?

I was still trying to convince myself that I
was looking forward to the evening when I knocked on her door at six o�
clock.� Debbie and indeed the rest of the
staff had already gone.� I opened the
door to her office.� It was dark except
for a light on her desk.

�Come in.��
Diane was behind her desk studying her papers.� She looked up as I entered and smiled.�� It was a really warm, welcoming smile.

�Hi Dave.�
I�m almost ready to go.� I�ve
already changed.� I�ve just got to get
these papers sorted out.�� Only one
thing.� I think I scuffed my shoes while
I was changing.� Would you be a sweetie
and give them a clean?�� She bent her head
down to her papers.

I wasn�t sure what to do.� I walked round to the side of her desk.� I then saw she had changed into a long
tight-fitting red dress and matching red high-heeled shoes.� I couldn�t see any polish anywhere.� I stood next to her desk confused and
panicky.

�What�s the problem?�� She looked up irritated.

�I can�t see any polish,� I explained.

�Well, if you can�t see any polish you�ll
have to use something else, won�t you?��
She waited expectantly but I had no answer.� She sighed.�
�You�ve got a goddamn tongue, haven�t you?� Well, use that.�

She swung round in her seat and crossed her
legs.� �I�ll make it easy for you.� Now get busy.�

She obviously meant for me to get down on the
floor and lick her shoes clean.� I didn�t
know whether I could do it.� But I needed
this job.

I sank to the floor and leaned forward until
my tongue met the soft leather of her higher show.� I started to lick.� I could feel the shape of her toes through
the shoe.� The taste was unpleasant and I
needed plenty of spit to moisten the leather.�
I used my handkerchief to polish the leather.� I knew I had to get the leather shiny but
must have pressed too hard for Diane suddenly moved her shoe away from me and
kicked me in the chest.

�Not so hard, fool!� Do that again and I�ll be kicking you in the
mouth.�

So then I had to get the leather shiny
without pressing too hard.� It wasn�t
easy.� I was terrified that I�d end up
with her shoe flying towards my mouth.

When I finished the first shoe I hoped that
she would re-cross her legs but she didn�t.�
Maybe she thought I would try to sneak a view between her thighs but I
was far too scared for anything like that.�
Whatever the reason she didn�t move and I had to bend down right to the
floor to start on the second shoe.

�What are you doing?�� Diane�s soft voice with its hard edge hit me.

�I-I�m doing your other shoe.�

�You haven�t finished the first shoe
yet.� What about he sole?�

�The sole?�

�Yes, the sole.� The sole.�
You know the bit under the shoe, the bit that walks on the ground, that
bit that�ll walk on your fucking face if you don�t pull your socks up.�

She lifted her first shoe and presented me
with the sole.� I had no choice.� I got to it straightaway.� When I finished I actually asked her to
re-cross her legs so that I could do the sole on her other shoe, which was, of
course, still on the floor.

�You are so useless.� Do I have to do everything for you?�� Nevertheless she re-crossed her legs.� I noticed that now she ignored her papers and
was smoking a cigarette while she looked down at me busy with her shoes.� When I finished she stubbed out her cigarette
and stood up.� I had to move quickly to
avoid being hit in the head by her shoes.

During the reception she was as nice as
pie.� Introducing me to her colleagues
with some respect.� However, while I
called her Diane during the reception she insisted that I call her Mrs
Hathaway, as I had to during office hours, once we were outside.

We had taken her car to the reception so
afterwards she drove back to the office so I could pick my car up.� On the way she patted my knee.

�You did very well tonight, Dave.� So well, in fact, that I�ve decided to
promote you.� Not bad, eh?� You�ve only been with my company one day and
already a promotion.� I�ve decided to
make you my PA.� I�ve been thinking for
some time I need a PA and I think you�re just the guy for the job.� It goes with a fifty percent salary
increase.�

I was surprised, knocked back.� I liked the salary increase but I wasn�t a
PA.� I didn�t even know if I could do the
job.� I said as much to Diane.

�You haven�t got the picture, Dave.� I�m not asking if you want to be my PA, I�m
telling you that�s what you�re going to be.�
There�s no discussion.� Now out
you pop and I�ll see you in my office at nine o�clock when I�ll explain what
your duties are.�

Standing in the car park I stared nervously
after her car�s headlights as Diane shot away from me.

At nine o� clock next morning her secretary
showed me into Diane�s office.� Diane
waved me towards a seat.

�Dave, the job of a PA is to help me do my
job better.� I can get quite stressed
out.� Your job is to help me unwind.� Do you think you can do that?�� I didn�t think she really wanted an answer so
I stayed quiet.� �For example,� she
continued, �last night I really enjoyed having you lick my shoes clean.� I found it soothing and relaxing.� So this morning you can start with that.� However, I have people coming in and out of
my office all day so it would be better all round if you crawl under my desk
and get to work from there.� It�ll be a
bit of a tight squeeze for you, I�m afraid.�
In fact it�ll be a very tight squeeze.�
And particularly uncomfortable as you�re wearing such tight jeans.� But I�m sure you�ll soon get used to it.�

I couldn�t do this.� Job or no job I wasn�t going to sit under her
desk all day licking her shoes.

�You can keep your job,� I said, �I resign.�

�Dave,� she said softly, smiling in a
condescending fashion.� �If you resign
I�ll see to it that you won�t get another job in this city.�� She thought for a moment.� �Better still, I�ll have my good friend, the
Chief of Police, frame you for an unsolved case of child rape.� So, my little child rapist, unless you want
me to hand you over to the police for your just punishment you�ll get under my
desk right now and start licking.�� I
felt sick, I have always had a pathological fear of the police and of being
arrested for a crime I hadn�t committed.�
I was in a panic.�� She waited and
then smiling pressed her intercom.�
�Debbie, could you get me the Chief of Police?� I scurried round her
desk and almost pushed Diane out of the way to get under it.� I noticed briefly that she was wearing shoes
with high, sharp heels and that her legs were bare.� She helpfully used her feet to push me well
in.� Having forced me into the small gap between
her legs and the front of her desk she put one shoe on the back of my neck and
forced my mouth down onto her other shoe.�
The sharp pointed heel on the back of my neck really hurt.� Moreover, Diane�s office floor was made up of
wood panelling and it was hard and uncomfortable.� My tight jeans almost prevented me breathing.

�Get licking, Dave.� I don�t want to wait all day.�� I tried to comply as best I could but I was
forced down so firmly onto her shoe that it didn�t leave enough room to get my
tongue out.� Diane pressed down even
harder.�� �Start licking or I�ll fucking
strangle you.�� I forced out my tongue
and started licking.� �Yeah, that�s the
idea, boy.�� She relaxed her other foot a
little and this made breathing a bit easier and gave me some more room, but she
still kept her shoe firmly on my neck.

She buzzed on her intercom.� �Debbie, will you come in here?�� I felt Diane lean back in her seat and heard
her sigh contentedly.� She pushed down a
little harder on my neck.� �That�s my
boy.� You can move up to my foot
now.� But not too high.� You get near my ankle and I�ll fucking smash
your face.�� Her skin was much more
pleasant to my tongue; it was quite soft.

I heard Debbie�s heels as she came into the
office.

�How�s your new PA working out, Mrs
Hathaway?�

�Just fine, Debbie.�� I heard them both laugh.� Then Diane twisted her heel hard into the
back of my neck.� I leapt up and
screamed, simultaneously banging my head on Diane�s desk.� The two women shrieked with laughter.� Diane�s face appeared below her desk.

�Did I tell you to stop, Dave?�� Her face disappeared and then her foot
flashed out and smashed me in the stomach.��
I collapsed on the floor groaning and clutching my stomach.� �Next time you decide to disobey me I won�t
be so nice.� Now get with that
licking.� And don�t make a sound.�� She thrust me back carelessly under her desk
with her feet and I twisted round painfully to start work again on her shoes.� I was feeling sick and almost crying in
despair.

�Debbie, could you organise a working lunch
today.� I�ve got a long meeting starting
at ten thirty and I don�t want to be disturbed.�

�Sure thing, Mrs Hathaway.� By the way Joe Keithley is here, should I
show him in.�

�Please.�

I heard Debbie�s heels disappear and the door
close.

�How are you doing, Dave?�� I felt her wriggle her toes in her shoes then
she slipped her feet out of her shoes.�
�I want you to lick between the toes.�
Do it slowly and make it kinda sensuous.�� I carefully bent down to the task and did as
well as I could.� �Don�t spend too long
on it, boy.� My meeting starts soon and I
don�t think it would be right for you to be sucking my toes while I�m chairing
a meeting, do you?�� Did this mean that I
would soon be free of this prison?

I heard the door open and Debbie�s voice.

�Joseph Keithley to see you. Mrs Hathaway.�

�Good, show him in.�� I was sure I could detect a smile in Diane�s
voice.� �Put my shoes on, Dave.�� She giggled.�
�I mean put them on me, just in case you were thinking of doing
something pervy.�� I held her shoes for
her so she could slip her feet in.

�You can leave off licking my shoes for a
bit.�� I almost said thank you.� But, in fact, there wasn�t time to say
anything for the heel of Diane�s shoe smashed into my neck, pinioning me at the
back of Diane�s desk.� I couldn�t
breathe.� I managed a croak and Diane
relaxed her grip a little, enough for me to be able to suck in some air.� There were footsteps.

�Sit down, Joseph.�� There was a creak.� �You�ve been with this company almost twenty
years, haven�t you Joseph?� Since my late
husband started it?�

�Yes, Mrs Hathaway.�

�Hmm.�
I�m going to have to sack you, Joseph, with immediate effect.�

There was a gasp.� �W-why, Mrs Hathaway.�

�My secretary said that you tried to
proposition her.� I won�t stand for any
kind of sexual harassment in this office.�
You�re to leave immediately.�

�But it�s not true, Mrs Hathaway.�� The poor man was clearly in tears.� The way that Diane had pinioned me allowed me
to look up a little.� As Joseph Keithley
started to talk I saw Diane�s hand draw up her dress and drop onto her
crotch.� She wasn�t wearing any
panties.� Slowly she began to rub herself
up and down.

�I would expect you to say that.� I trust my secretary implicitly.� Collect your cards now.�

�But my wife, my children.� Please, it�s not true.�

�I�ll make damn sure you never get another
job in this city again.�� She was rubbing
herself faster and faster and gradually applying more pressure to my neck.� I tried to croak again but she ignored me or
maybe didn�t even hear me in her own excitement.

�Please Mrs Hathaway, I need this job - .�

�Get out now before I call the police,� she
yelled.� I could feel her trembling
through her legs.

�Please Mrs - .�

�Out, out.��
I heard him tottering over the floor weeping.� He had barely closed the door when Diane
slammed her heel hard against my neck.� I
screamed and almost simultaneously Diane screamed in exultant pleasure.� She panted for few moments and then buzzed the
intercom.

�Did you enjoy that as much as I did,
Debbie?�

�Perhaps not quite as much.�� Debbie�s faint reply.

�No, you don�t have a PA, do you?�� Diane was absently rubbing her shoe over my
face and then pressed the sole down� on
my mouth as she spoke.� �I haven�t had so
much fun for ages.� If you get any more
ideas like that, do let me know.�� Debbie
and she laughed together and then Diane cut the connection.

She sat back in her chair tapping her show
hard on my face.

�Did you enjoy that, Dave?�� It seemed strange to be talked to by someone
only whose legs I could see.� �I bet you
were pleased that it wasn�t you I fired.�
Well you�re not to worry � I won�t be firing you.� You�re going to have a long and successful
career here.� Mind you, my definition of
your success may not be quite the same as yours.� Anyway I think it�s time to increase your
responsibilities.� All that excitement
has made things a little messy so I want you to help clean me.�� Her legs parted and I was overwhelmed by her
powerful aroma.� Her shoe slid off my
face and I was able to breathe more easily.�
Although only for a moment for she reached down and with her hands
grabbed me by the scruff of the neck and hauled me up to her crotch.� I had hardly time to grasp what was happening
when I found my face pressed hard against her wet pussy.

�Okay Dave, guess what you�re going to
do?�� She wrapped her legs around my head
and squeezed.� �Get licking, boy, and
make sure I�m nice and clean.�� But she
pressed me so hard to her that I could barely breathe let alone lick.� I moaned and she must have heard me.� She released me.� �I guess this is a bit difficult but I want
you to get used to it.� I love it when I
press you so hard against me that you can hardly breathe.� And I want you to give me as much pleasure as
possible.� So you�ll have to work out how
you can breathe and lick me at the same time, when you�re pressed hard against
my pussy.� Think of it as a
challenge.� It�ll bring us closer
together, Dave.� As this is your first
time I�ll make it easier for you.�� She
pulled me into her but gave me room to breathe and lick.� �But don�t take my generosity for granted,
boy.� This is the first and last
time.� After this you�re on your own.�

I couldn�t believe this was happening to me
and I couldn�t see any way out of it.�
She had me trapped.� I didn�t know
if she was bluffing about the Chief of Police but I couldn�t take a
chance.� Gingerly, I started licking; the
taste and smell were pretty strong.

�That�s it, Dave.� You�re good at this.� Now I want you to get me nice and clean but I
don�t want you to get me overly excited because I�ve got an important meeting
starting in a moment and if I get excited it�ll be embarrassing.� And if I�m embarrassed I�ll get annoyed.� And - .��
Here she lifted up my head to grin at me.� �- if I�m annoyed I�ll have to punish
you.�� Then she popped me back into
place.�� �So, for your sake, I hope
you�ll be able to clean me up without exciting me.� Oh, and if you make a fucking sound � you�re
dead.�

She dropped her legs over my shoulders, gave
me an extra hard squeeze that almost suffocated me, then relaxed a little to
allow me to start licking.

I probed around sucking where I could, being
careful to stop if I felt the slightest shudder from her.� She patted the top of my head.� �Well done, Dave.� You�re doing very well.�

The office door opened, there were voices and
the sound of chairs being moved.

�Are we all here?�� It was Diane�s voice.� �Right then Frank, your report please.�� It became clear that it was an end-of-month
sales meeting.� I couldn�t understand
what it was all about.� I continued to
slurp and lick quietly and gently.�
Eventually from the taste I was pretty sure that all was clean and I
gradually slowed to a halt.� I sat there,
under her desk, too scared to move but getting more and more
uncomfortable.� The hard wood floor
seemed to bore into my knees.

The meeting wound on.� After what seemed like an eternity someone
suggested a comfort break.� Diane asked
everyone to reconvene in five minutes.

When the office had cleared Diane caught hold
of my hair and painfully yanked my head up.

�Oh dear, your face is a mess.� It�s all sticky.� Let me clean you up.�� She took a tissue from her desk and wiped my
face with it.� �That�s better.� But now what am I going to do with this
tissue.� I can�t put it in the trash for
the cleaners to find.� You�d better eat
it.�� With that she shoved it into my
mouth.� I choked and coughed and tried to
pluck it from my mouth.

�No, no!��
Diane grabbed my hands.� �You�ve
got to swallow it.� Come on, be a
man.� Get it down.�� I struggled sick and wretched, with tears in
my eyes.� At last it went down my
throat.� �There you are, that wasn�t so
bad, was it?� Now I expect you need a
drink, don�t you?�

�Yes.��
I gasped with relief.� I
desperately needed a drink.

�I thought so, Well the others have gone for
a comfort break but I haven�t time so you�re going to help me out.� In fact we�re going to help each other.� Isn�t that great?��� You�re going to save me time and I�m going
to give you a drink.� Now come
here.�� I would have struggled if I could
but she held my head firmly as she wedged me tight to her crotch, my nose and
mouth forming a tight seal.� After a
moment she started to pee into my mouth.�
The hot salty liquid stung against my tongue and my throat.� My mouth started to fill up.� I couldn�t breathe and it looked like I was
going to drown for I couldn�t swallow either.�
There was a ringing in my ears.� I
was terrified.� If Diane didn�t stop soon
I was a goner.� Somehow I managed to gulp
down a little of the liquid and then a little more.� But Diane still kept peeing.� I tried to shake my head to force down more
liquid.� As Diane wouldn�t release me I
tried to use my hands to force her up so that she would be peeing at a higher
angle and it would more easily pass down my throat.�� Diane started to giggle and let me go.� Her pee splashed over my face and onto the
floor.

�Oh, Dave, you�re impossible!�� Diane laughed.� �You� better lick up all my pee quickly or
else it�ll smell.� Come on.�� She pushed my head to the floor and started
pulling it around.� �This has to be
easier than licking my shoes.� Get busy,
Dave.� If there�s one drop of pee left
when the others return I�m handing you over to the police.�� 

I crawled around licking everything up as
fast as I could � fluff and grit as well.�
Diane stood over me laughing.

�Dave, you are wonderful.� Hey, maybe I should get you to lick the whole
of this room.�� I looked up
startled.� Her eyes gleamed.� �Or maybe,� she added breathlessly, �the
whole building.� You could do one floor
every night.� Before the cleaners come
in, of course.� There wouldn�t be much
point in doing it after the cleaners.� Or
maybe we could use you instead of the cleaners.�
Hmm, it�s worth thinking about, isn�t it, Dave.� I can hear the others coming back now and,�
she looked carefully over the floor, �you�ve cleaned up all the pee.� Well done.��
She sat down in her seat, took my head in her hands and kissed me on the
forehead.� Then she pushed me brutally
into the gap under her desk and slammed her shoes into me.� Once again her heel dug painfully into my neck
and forced me against the shoe on the ground.

�Get licking, boy.� I can�t feel your tongue, boy.�� She pressed down even harder.� �And remember, no sound!�� I wanted to scream but I controlled
myself.� I managed to get my tongue out
of my forcibly closed mouth and began licking as best as I could.� How long was this to continue?� There was going to be working lunch.� That meant that I could be here the whole
day.� It was an horrific thought.

The others returned with a scraping of chairs
and the meeting recommenced.� It must
have continued for almost an hour and a half but during that time the pressure
of Diane�s shoe on my neck did not let up once.�
I could hardly believe that so beautiful a woman could keep up that
level of careless cruelty for so long.� I
think my neck had gone numb by the time I heard the trolleys rolling into the
office with the lunch.� At last Diane
relaxed her foot and took it off my neck.�
I heard the others leave to do their own business before they returned
for lunch.

�Debbie, could you select some sandwiches for
me, I have� some phone-calls to
make.�� Over the noise of the others in
the room leaving she leant down and whispered to me.� �Dave, you�ve no idea how much pleasure
you�re giving me.� You make a boring
meeting tolerable, even enjoyable.�� 

I saw Debbie�s legs appear round the corner
of the desk.� Debbie was presumably
carrying Diane�s food.

�Is he still under there, Mrs Hathaway?�

�Of course, do you want to take a look?�

Debbie�s face appeared under the desk.� She was smiling broadly.� Debbie and Diane both looked at each other
and then burst out laughing.

�Can I have him when you�re finished with
him?� gasped Debbie.

�There might not be anything left,� said
Diane.� That brought fresh outbursts of
laughter from the two women.

�Have you used him yet for you-know-what?�
asked Debbie.

�I thought I�d save that for the afternoon.�

�Lucky you.�

�Maybe � he might not be any good.�

�In that case you could just break his nose
while he was in position, to teach him a lesson.�

Diane stretched out her hand and stroked my
hair.� I cowered.� �Oh, Dave knows what will happen to him if he
doesn�t come up to scratch.� Don�t you ,
Dave?�� I whimpered.

�The poor dear,� said Debbie.� �I think he�s scared.� Although if he knew what was going to happen
to him he�d be terrified.��� With shrieks
of laughter the two woman hi-fived each other and stood up.

Diane sat back in her seat and hauled me into
position.

�Now, Dave.�
Your responsibilities increase all the time.� This afternoon�s meeting is going to be quite
stressful and I want you to keep me nice and calm.� So you�re to apply your tongue to my lips, my
lower lips, of course, and bring me to a nice, sweet orgasm.� I�m sure you�ll be able to do it because I�m
sure you know what will happen to you if you don�t..� Here come the others now.�� She shoved me hard against her and squeezed
her thighs against me head.� Again I
could hardly breathe.� I managed to force
my tongue out and my one thought was that if I brought her to a climax quickly
I would be freed.� I started work, dimly
aware that around me people were talking and eating, including Diane.� Occasionally, I felt her stroke my hair.� As she became more excited instead of
bucking, to control herself, she squeezed me ever harder.� I thought my head would burst.� Eventually she came silently and I felt her
relax a little.� But then, instead of
freeing me, she wedged me right into her.�
All this time she was talking calmly and, as far as I could judge,
eloquently during the meeting.� She then
proceeded to pee into my mouth.� Again I
had to gulp as well as I could.� However,
this time, to stop me doing anything with my hands, she pinioned my hands to
the floor with her heels, pressing down firmly and ruthlessly.� I was in agony and my mouth was burning. �But Diane seemed to be enjoying the experience
� I felt that she was relaxed and in control.�


I didn�t think I was going to get all the pee
down and, feeling sick, was beginning to choke.�
But Diane signalled her displeasure by pressing down viciously with her
heels and I forced myself to overcome my nausea and the feeling of drowning
that I was experiencing.

I think there must have been another comfort
break but I was only barely conscious of people moving back chairs and walking
around.

Diane lifted my head and spoke to me.

�You did all right there, Dave.� But next time no messing about.� When I pee in your mouth you damn well drink
it all down quick, no matter how fast or how much I pee or how tightly I�m
gripping you.� I don�t fucking care
whether you can breathe or not. I�m in control here, boy, and you better
remember it.� You screw up next time and
you�ll be eating my shit.� Go that?

�It�s the last part of the meeting now and I
want you to give me a nice slow orgasm.�
About one and a half hours should do it.�
If you bring me off earlier or later I�ll damn well have you beaten up
and handed over to the police.� After
you�ve eaten my shit, that is.� Is that
understood?�� She jabbed her heels
suddenly into my hands to emphasise her question.

�Yes,� I whimpered.� I hoped if I sounded despairing she would
show some mercy.� No such luck.

�Get to it, boy.�� She grabbed me by the hair and slammed me
into her so hard I thought she had broken my nose.� I was terrified; if I started to bleed over
her she would really be mad.� I licked
slowly and carefully as I was pretty sure she wasn�t fooling about her
threats.� I started counting methodically
every second, scared to my bones that I would miss the count.� Time seemed to pass by in a dream.� Now and again I would feel Diane�s hand on
the top of my head petting me with both encouragement and praise.� If I was going to fast Diane would help out
by stabbing her heel into my hand.��
Although I managed to maintain a steady count I hardly knew what I was
doing.� I had to count to five thousand,
four hundred and it was only the terror of failing that forced me to keep
going.� Unbelievingly as I approached the
magic number I felt Diane stiffen, her thighs closed around my head with
terrifying tightness and her heels seemed to push through my hands. �Threats or no threats I tried to scream in
anguish but my mouth was comfortably muffled by Diane�s crotch.

I heard Diane bring the meeting to an end
and, despite my almost unimaginable pain and exhaustion, I was impressed at her
coolness.

Once again when everyone had left Diane
hauled me up.� If she had not done so I
would have collapsed on the floor.� I had
been squashed under her desk, licking her, drinking her pee, suffering the
agony of her heels for almost seven hours and I was in no state to move.

�Dave, that was brilliant!� You�ve earned yourself a bonus.� I ought to take you out for dinner tonight
and�� damn it, I will.� Go and clean yourself up.� You might brush your teeth, your breath
smells awful.�

I was shaking as I emerged from her
desk.� �Use my private washroom, Dave,�
continued Diane.� �You deserve it.�

I disappeared into the washroom.� I stayed there longer than I needed, just to
take the opportunity of a break from Diane.�
When I came out Debbie was in the office with Diane.

Diane smiled at me gaily.� That smile scared me more than any threat.

�Dave, there�s been a change of plan,� said
Diane.� �Debbie was going to join us and
then she suggested it would be much more fun if we send out for food and had a
quiet little dinner at my house.� I couldn�t
resist it.� Are you happy with that,
Dave?�� I was almost in tears.� I suspected the dinner would be more fun for
Diane and Debbie than for me.

I accompanied the two women to Diane�s
car.� It was large, as befitted a company
chairman (or chairwoman in this case).� I
turned to the back door but Diane waved me round to the front.

�No, no, Dave, you ride in the front with me
and Debbie.� Get in.�� I climbed inside and sat in the front seat.

�Dave,� said Debbie, �don�t be silly.� You can hardly sit up here with me and
Diane.�� I was puzzled and
frightened.� �On the floor, Dave,�
explained Debbie.� �Curl up nice and
small on the floor.�� I want a chance to
experience what Diane has experienced all day.�
It�s only fair, isn�t it, Dave?�

I slid onto the floor.� It was quite roomy for a car but could hardly
accommodate me.� Debbie climbed into the
passenger seat and carefully placed her shoes on me.

�It�s nice, isn�t it, Mrs Hathaway?�

�Call me Diane when we are out of the office,
for goodness sake.� And you must too,
Dave, � she added looking down at me.

�How much pressure can he take, Diane?� asked
Debbie.

�I�ve no idea.� Try it and see.�

Debbie was also in high-heels, even higher
and more pointed than Diane�s.��� I saw
with horror Debbie press herself back into her seat to give herself purchase
and then she drove her shoes suddenly into my neck.� I couldn�t believe the pain.� She pressed harder and harder. 

�Dave,� said Diane, �you can scream if you
want to this time.� There�s no-one else
around.�

I wasn�t going to give them the satisfaction
but then Debbie stabbed her shoe against my cheek and I hollered like a
banshee.

�Wow, that was some scream,� said
Debbie.� �Can I have another go, Diane?�

�Sure, but don�t damage him.� I am suppose to be treating him to dinner
tonight.�

�Oh, that�s a shame, it�s such fun!� And such a turn on having a man crawl at your
feet.�� She pressed the sole of her shoe
against my mouth.� �Lick it, Dave.� And lick it real fast.� I�m going to be timing you and I want at
least one hundred and twenty licks per minute.�
My shoes have nice thin soles so I can feel every movement.� I�m starting to count from...now!�

I licked as fast as I could.� The trouble was I soon began to run out of
spit and had to slow down.� I had a clear
view of Debbie�s face and as I slowed down she pouted.

�Dave, that�s not fair.� I only asked you to do a little thing and
you�ve hardly been going three minutes.��
I was in a panic.� I gathered some
more saliva and started again vigorously.�
�No, no, Dave, it�s too late now.�
You haven�t done what I asked you to do.�� It looks like I�m going to have to do it
myself.�� What on earth did she mean?�� �Now stretch out your tongue on the floor, as
far as it will go.�� I did as she
asked.� �More, Dave.�� There was a hint of warning in her
voice.� �I know you can do better than
that.�� I stretched until my tongue
ached.� �Right, let�s see if I can help
you with this sole licking.�� She stamped
the sole of her shoe hard down on my tongue and began to rub it backwards and
forwards over the floor of the car very fast.�
I cried and gurgled.� I couldn�t
believe the pain.� I thought she was
going to tear my tongue out at the roots.�
�Now this is the way to lick the sole of a woman�s shoe.� I hope you�re learning this lesson,
Dave.� I know you�re going to be grateful
to me.�� Debbie kept up the rubbing for a
good few minutes and then rested, her shoe still firmly pressed on my
tongue.� I desperately wanted the journey
to end.� �Now, Dave, have you learnt your
lesson?�� I gurgled an affirmative.� �What�s that?�
I don�t understand.� Why on earth
can�t you speak clearly.� You certainly don�t
know how to use your mouth, do you?� You
couldn�t lick my shoe.� And then when I
show you how to lick my shoe you won�t even speak to me.� That�s not very nice.�� I tried nodding yes with my head although
that made the pain in my tongue terrible.�
�I think you need another lesson, a better lesson this time.�� With that she started dragging my tongue
viciously over the floor.� I just cried,
I couldn�t think of anything else to do.

�You know teaching a guy to show respect can
be pretty exhausting,� said Debbie.

�Tell me about it,� said Diane

�Well, if I�m to spend my time teaching him I
reckon he ought to pay me for the privilege.�

�That seems reasonable,� said Diane.� �I tell you what � Dave will give you half of
his salary, I�ll organise it with payroll, and you give Dave his lessons
whenever you think he needs them.� It�ll
have to be outside business hours because I need him then.�

Diane must have been at a stop light because
she looked down at me.� �Sorry, Dave,
you�ve just lost half your salary, but I think you�ll find Debbie a good
teacher.� I�ll give her full permission
for her to do anything she thinks is necessary.�
After all it will be much easier for me if you�ve been trained to show
proper respect for a woman.�

Debbie eventually removed her shoe from my
tongue.� I�m sure it was longer now.� The car drew to a stop and we all clambered
out.� I didn�t feel much like eating
now.� Debbie helped me out of the
car.� �You okay, Dave?� I hope there are no hard feelings.�

�Actually,� broke in Diane, �I hope there
are!�

The two women fell about at that.�� I was sullenly aware of what they meant for,
on the way to the house, Diane grabbed my penis and used it as a lead.� Debbie followed.

Once inside Diane asked, �What do you fancy,
Debbie?� French, Italian, Spanish?

�Frankly�, said Debbie, �I fancy American,�
looking directly at me.

�So do I,� said Diane� �Come on, Dave, let�s go upstairs.�

I was exhausted, pulled apart, my tongue in
agony, my body aching.� But I was going
upstairs with two beautiful women, presumably to Diane�s bedroom.� I was hoping I was finally going to get a
payoff.� Especially when Diane said:

�You know Dave�s been such a good sport today
that it�s about time he had a little fun.�

�I agree.�
Do you want to go first?�

�Let Dave decide.� After all it�s his treat.�� She turned to me.� �Well, Dave, who do you want to fuck first,
me or Debbie?�

This was such a shock that I just stood there
and gasped.

�The poor thing is all confused,� said
Debbie, �he didn�t expect this.�

�Well, if Dave can�t decide I�ll go first, by
reason of age and authority.�

Diane unzipped her dress and stepped out of
it.� �Come on, Dave.� You have to undress too.�� 

I followed her and removed my clothes not
quite believing that I was actually going to fuck her.

�Now help me with this, you too.�� She hauled out from below the bed a rubber
sheet.� �Just in case we make a mess,�
added Diane.

�What are we going to do?� I asked rather
nervously.

�Make love, of course, but you can�t be too
careful,� said Diane.

We helped her lay out the rubber sheet then
Diane said.� �When I make love I really
like having my arse licked before fucking.�
And I know Dave will oblige.�

This didn�t sound too great an idea to me and
I was rather hesitant in response.

�Dave, you�ve been so good up to now,� said
Diane, as she stroked my face and then put her arms around my neck.� �Don�t spoil things.� I don�t want to have to get you beaten up and
handed over to the police.� Although I
admit the idea does rather excite me you have far better uses.� �Now,� she added patting the rubber sheet,
�up you pop and lie down on your back so I can lower myself onto you.�

�You�re not going to smother me again, are
you?�� I was in despair now.

�Dave, don�t make such a fuss.� You know I�ll do what I want anyway.� Now get up here.� I don�t want to have to ask you again.�

I complied with her request.� What else could I do?� The rubber sheet was cold against my skin.

�Dave, I�m really looking forward to
this.�� So saying she stepped onto the
bed and faced me.� Then she lowered
herself and kissed me passionately, forcing her tongue through my lips.� I responded hoping thus that she would be
more kindly disposed to me.� She pulled
away.

�You�re a wonderful kisser, Dave.� Now let�s see if you can use that tongue just
as well.�� She swung her long legs over
my face and spun round.� Slowly she
lowered her arse.� It was a beautiful
arse but I still couldn�t believe this was really happening.� What was I supposed to do?

�Get that tongue out and start licking,
Dave.�� Her arse was poised just above me
then it suddenly collapsed onto my face.�
This was serious, this time I really couldn�t breathe.� I tried to struggle, I would have bitten
Diane if I could.� Dimly I heard her
giggle and then she raised her arse.

�Sorry, Dave, I couldn�t resist it.� Now you get licking.�

I was terrified that overcome with excitement
she would give way to her desires and fall on me again.� Nevertheless I delicately started licking
round her anus.� After a few moments I
heard her sigh.

�No, no!�
In the crack.� Get your tongue
deep into that crack, boy.�� Did she
really mean that I should lick right inside her arse.� I wasn�t left in any doubt when her fist struck
my balls.� I yelped in agony.� �You heard me, Dave!�

I pushed my tongue into the crack.� As I probed deeper I definitely picked up a
bitter taste.� I was horrified but Diane
started to squirm with pleasure.

�That�s it,
that�s it!� But go deeper, deeper.�

I went deeper and my tongue
suddenly touched something hard.� I
guessed what it was I had touched.�
Simultaneously Diane gasped.

�Dave, I think you�ve just found my latest
turd.� Keep licking it while I push it
out towards you.�� Was she serious?� I was sickened and terrified.� I felt the turd push against my tongue.� Diane lifted herself up a little and I saw
the tip of the turd emerge from her arse.�
The smell was appalling.

�Lick it, you fucking bastard,� she suddenly
screamed.� �Lick it or I�ll tear your
fucking balls off.�

I licked it as it came further and further
out.

�Get your mouth around it, boy and run your
lips up and down it.� Male love to
it.� It�s part of me.� Part of your boss.� Part of Diane Hathaway.�� She yelled in ecstasy as a final push forced
the huge log out of Diane�s arse and straight into my mouth.� I gagged.�
I wanted to puke.

�If you�re sick, it�ll be the last thing you
ever do,� screamed Diane.� �Now start
chewing � I want to hear you chew it real slow.�

It was awful.�
It was beyond belief.� I started
chewing.

�That�s it, Dave.� Now let me hear you swallow a little.�� I gulped down.

�Yes, yes!�
That�s it!� Now carry on chewing
and swallowing.�� I did as she
asked.� I don�t know how I stopped myself
puking.� �That�s brilliant, Dave.� Oh, God.�
That�s so good.� You�ve no
idea.� Get it down quick.� I�ve another one coming and I want you to get
it down in one swallow.�� I tried to get as
much down as possible.� Then suddenly
there was another log forced straight into my mouth, on top of the first.� �Go, it, Dave.� That�s wonderful.� That�s really good.� Isn�t it disgusting?� Isn�t it really vile?� Oh God!�
I�m sure it is.� Yes!� Yes!�
Oh, David.� Chew it, boy.� Yes.�
Yes.. Grind it slow.� Let me hear
you savour it.� Oh, yes.� Oh, yes.�
Yes.� YES!�

I knew she�d come.� Perhaps stronger than she�d ever come
before.� I felt her whole body trembling,
heard her panting.� But she hadn�t collapsed
on my face.� Instead she rolled over and
faced me.

�Oh, Dave, you smell disgusting.� But that was the most wonderful, the most
beautiful thing that anyone has ever done for me.�� Her face was ecstatic.� �Now you get yourself cleaned up in the
bathroom and then it�s Debbie�s turn.�
Make sure you�re nice and clean.�

I tottered off to the bathroom and washed my
mouth out.� I couldn�t bear the idea of
going through the same thing with Debbie.�


When I came back into the bedroom I threw
myself at Diane�s and Debbie�s feet and kissed them, pleading with them to let
me go.� I couldn�t bear to swallow any more
shit.

�Dave,� said Diane, �this is really sweet of
you to show so much respect.� And maybe
we�ll take you up on it later.� But it�s
only fair, Debbie is expecting her turn and I know you won�t want to disappoint
her, will you?� Now up you get on that bed.�

I returned to the bed, tears burning my
eyes.� Debbie stripped off and approached
me.

�Open wide, Dave,� she said as she climbed on
the bed and turned her arse to me.� �Now,
I want every little bit swallowed down.�

She lowered herself onto my mouth and in a
few moments there was a log in my mouth.

�Eat it all up.� And then there�ll be another, for you.�� I started chewing and swallowing.� I didn�t know if I could keep this up.

�How long do you think you�ll be, Debbie.�

�I�ve no idea.� You know, I think I�ll just stay here for a
bit and make sure everything is out.� Is
that okay.�

�Sure.�
I�ll put the TV on for you.� Relax
and enjoy yourself.� I�ll be downstairs.�

I heard noise from the TV and then the door
closed.

�Isn�t this fun, Dave.� Oh, here comes another.�� She forced another log into my mouth.� It tasted worse than any before.

I heard Debbie laughing at something on the
TV.� There was nothing else from her arse
for about ten minutes.� It was hot lying
beneath her but at least I could breathe.�
Suddenly she farted.

�Dave, I think all this excitement has given
me a little stomach problem.� Now, this
time there may be a lot but you�ve still got to get it all done.�

She farted again and then suddenly my mouth
was full of soft shit.� It was pouring
in.

�Swallow it, Dave.� And when you�ve finished clean me up.� I think I�ll lie here for about an hour and I
don�t want to be dirty.�

I had to suck it all down.� I was scared I was being poisoned but I had
no choice.� I was revolted,
appalled.� I started to clean up Debbie
but as I did she collapsed on top of me, smashing onto my mouth.

�That�s more comfy, isn�t it, Dave.� But you�ve still got to get me clean.�

It was hard work and very slow and exhausting
as well as being vile.� I don�t know how
long I was there but after what seemed like hours Debbie stood up.

�That was great Dave, you�re a wonderful
find.� Now go and get my shoes.�

I looked round and saw Debbie�s black,
high-heeled slingbacks by the wardrobe.�
I brought them back to her.

�Put them on me, Dave.�

I knelt down and slipped her feet into them.

�Excellent.�
Now, lick my soles.� I think you
know how to do that properly, don�t you?�

I bent right onto the floor and licked her
right sole rapidly.� Not caring whether I
had sufficient spit I carried on so that my tongue became sorer and sorer.� I was scared, I just went on and on.� My tongue was becoming numb.� I became aware that Debbie was absorbed by
something on TV.� She seemed to have
forgotten about me.� Had she or was she
testing me?� If she had forgotten about
me what should I do?� I had been licking
Debbie�s sole for about ten minutes when I heard the door open.

�Hi, Debbie, what�s going on?�

�This program on TV is really fascinating?�

�Is it.��
Diane sat down to watch too.� Both
of them seemed to ignore the fact that I was at Debbie�s feet scraping away on
her sole with my tongue.� I was going
mad.

Eventually the program finished.� Debbie moved her foot away.

�That was excellent, Dave,� said Debbie.� �You�ve kept up that rapid licking for almost
half-an-hour.� You see, that lesson I
gave you was worth it.� So I think it�s
time for another lesson.� Now, I was
going to give you five hard kicks with my shoe.�
But as you seem to have learnt my first lesson so well I really feel I
ought to make sure that this lesson is even more effective so that you�ll
really benefit from it.� So I�m going to
give you fifteen very hard kicks.� Now
kneel on the floor.�

I knelt on the floor crying, looking up at
Debbie.�� Then she swung her leg back and
kicked me savagely in the stomach.� The
next kick caught me in the balls.� I
screamed.� The next kick was in the
face.� I was becoming delirious,
screaming and crying.� Diane grasped my
arms and held me up to ensure I�d get maximum benefit from the kicking.� I think some went in my neck but before the
fifteen were reached I had passed out.

When I came to Diane and Debbie were standing
over me.� They�d both dressed but I was
still in the nude.� They had glasses of
champagne in their hands.

�Hi Dave!� said Diane.� �We were just toasting you.� Actually we�re just filling ourselves up with
plenty of liquid so we can have some more fun later on.� During the evening we�re going to fill up the
loo with our pee and then get you to drink it all down.� Won�t that be fun?

�Anyway, you should know that I�m away on
business from tomorrow so Debbie is going to borrow you.�

�You can sit under my desk tomorrow.�
Unfortunately, for you, it is somewhat smaller that Diane�s and my legs
are somewhat longer so it�s going to be a very tight squeeze.�

�But it�s out in the open.�� I said.�
�Everyone will see me there.�

�But they�re all women in the office, Dave,�
said Diane.� �They�ll appreciate seeing
how a man learns to respect a woman.�
They�ll enjoy it, don�t worry.�

�Perhaps they could have a go at using him.�

�Yes.�
Or you know,� said Diane thoughtfully, �it would be better all round, if
you were just to pop him into that empty cubicle in the toilets and let the
women use him as and when they wanted to.�
Get one of those little portable toilets that we can strap him
into.� You can bolt his head into
it.� He�ll be permanently available
then.� Yes, Dave,� she added, dropping
onto her knees to come to my level and then patting my head, �you�ll be put
into your own little toilet with your head strapped in nice and tight.� It�ll hurt quite a bit but think of the
pleasure you�ll be giving to all those women.�
You can be proud of yourself.�

�Great idea, Diane.�

Diane stood up and they clinked their
glasses.

�Cheers, Diane.�

�Cheers, Debbie.�

Then they turned to me and raised their
glasses.

�And cheers, Dave!�
