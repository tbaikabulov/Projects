Chapter 1
My pet is such a sweet boy.&nbsp; Entirely oblivious to his own worth.&nbsp; I do try to instill a higher sense of self-esteem in him, but I temper it with some humility.&nbsp; It just wouldn&#8217;t do for him to realize how very special he is.&nbsp; There are enough egotistical men in the world, without adding to the supply.&nbsp; So I am, perhaps, overly harsh with him on occasion.&nbsp; I also keep him at arm&#8217;s length as much as possible.&nbsp; It just wouldn&#8217;t do for a Mistress to let her pet know how much he means to her.&nbsp; 

I met my pet a few years ago.&nbsp; He was so young, only 19, a sophomore at this little college in a small town, where I had gone to keep an eye on my brother.&nbsp; Our parents had recently died in an accident and he was processing his grief by acting out.&nbsp; I was afraid he was going to get in serious trouble, or hurt himself, so I had left the city, rented an apartment and had him stay with me while he sorted himself out.&nbsp; He needed the discipline and structure I could provide.&nbsp; 

I was enough older than him, that I still maintained some of the mystique I had cultivated when he was a little boy.&nbsp; I had recently found my niche as a Domme, after spending some time exploring being a submissive and then being mentored by an older Domme.&nbsp; Gradually taking over the physical aspects, under her tutelage, that age and health no longer allowed her to enjoy.&nbsp; I still speak to her every day, running ideas by her, making sure I don&#8217;t become arrogant and egotistical myself. 

I used some of the techniques she taught me on my brother.&nbsp; Not to make him my submissive, but simply to keep some semblance of control over a grief-stricken, head strong teenager.&nbsp; One day he had asked if he could invite some of his friends over for pizza and movies.&nbsp; I agreed on the stipulation that they all had to leave by midnight.&nbsp; Considering it was a school night I thought this more than fair.&nbsp; He must have been surprised enough that I had agreed, that he didn&#8217;t even argue.&nbsp; 

He knew I was an intensely private person, who avoided groups of people as much as possible.&nbsp; I was not looking forward to a host of college boys invading my home, but I knew my brother would impress upon them the necessity of minding their manners.&nbsp; The last run in we had had with a rude sales clerk had opened his eyes to how quickly his sister could become the evil bitch from hell.&nbsp; I had left both the sales clerk and the store manager in tears, and fearing for their jobs, without once raising my voice.&nbsp; 

When movie night arrived, I had given my brother enough money to buy several pizzas and a few gallons of soda.&nbsp; He had been settling down and doing well in school and I wanted to reward him.&nbsp; I told him that he and his friends could have the apartment to themselves for a few hours while I ran some errands, but that I expected them to clean up after themselves, and that I would be back by 9, but would stay in my room for the most part.&nbsp; Telling him to keep it low enough to not disturb the neighbors, I left before his friends came over, driving to the city to visit with my mentor.&nbsp; 

I returned to find the boys lounging around the living room watching some action movie.&nbsp; They all looked up as I entered the apartment, and my brother quickly hit pause when I stopped to survey the room.&nbsp; 

�Hiya sis.&nbsp; These are the guys.&nbsp; Guys, this is my sister Amy.�&nbsp; 

I smiled a greeting, noting the pizza boxes and soda bottles were all stacked on the kitchen counter and they had kept things relatively neat.&nbsp; �Gentlemen� I said, as I continued to my room.&nbsp; 

I heard the murmurs start up as soon as I went down the hallway.&nbsp; �That&#8217;s your sister?�&nbsp; 

�Man, she&#8217;s something.�&nbsp; 

�I don&#8217;t know, I wouldn&#8217;t mess with her.�&nbsp; 

�But she&#8217;s hot.�&nbsp; 

�Guys, that&#8217;s my sister you&#8217;re talking about.�&nbsp; 

I chuckled as the comments went on.&nbsp; Soon they went back to their movie.&nbsp; I sat in my room and read.&nbsp; I got up to get a drink from the kitchen, noticing that they had moved on to a different movie.&nbsp; This one actually looked interesting, so I leaned against the wall and watched it while I sipped my drink.&nbsp; 

One young man kept glancing at me as if wondering what I was up to.&nbsp; I figured I was keeping him from enjoying the movie, so, refilling my drink, I went back to my room.&nbsp; I made a quick run to the bathroom and came out to find the one, who had been looking at me, sitting on my bed.&nbsp; 

�What are you doing?� I asked.&nbsp; 

�I came to keep you company.&nbsp; You looked lonely.�&nbsp; 

�I&#8217;m quite well by myself.&nbsp; Please go back up front.�&nbsp; 

He got up, but instead of leaving, he came and stood in front of me.&nbsp; �I know what you want.&nbsp; Why you stayed up there pretending to watch the movie.�&nbsp; 

�You are mistaken.&nbsp; Now leave.� I said, trying to keep my temper.&nbsp; 

�You&#8217;re one of those bitches who likes to tease aren&#8217;t you?� he said, grabbing my face and trying to kiss me.&nbsp; 

That did it.&nbsp; I shot my hand out and grabbed his balls, squeezing them tightly and lifting so he was forced on to his toes.&nbsp; I started making him back up until he hit the wall.&nbsp; 

�Does your mother know you speak to women like that little boy?�&nbsp; 

Twisting his nuts cruelly, I started walking down the hall, forcing him to follow me, calling my brother.&nbsp; 

�Brian, get over here.�&nbsp; 

Jumping off the sofa, my brother froze as he saw me dragging his friend down the hallway.&nbsp; More than anything I wanted to yell at all of them to get out, but they weren&#8217;t responsible for one another&#8217;s actions.&nbsp; 

Taking a deep breath and struggling to modulate my voice, I said. �Brian, get his belongings and see him out.&nbsp; He is no longer welcome here.�&nbsp; 

As the rest of his friends stared in shock, my brother took one look at my face and glared at his friend.&nbsp; 

Afraid that he would try to harm the boy, I said.&nbsp; �Brian, just see him out and then come back and finish your movie.�&nbsp; 

He nodded and moved to grab his friend.&nbsp; One of the others was quicker, grabbing him by the arm and yanking him away.&nbsp; Since I hadn&#8217;t let go yet, this provoked a loud yelp from my assailant as his balls got yanked out of my hand.&nbsp; All the others herded him out the door.&nbsp; 

I went to the window to make sure my brother didn&#8217;t start any trouble.&nbsp; As they reached the front lawn I could hear them arguing.&nbsp; 

�Man, you&#8217;re crazy.&nbsp; What the hell were you thinking?�&nbsp; 

�I didn&#8217;t do anything.&nbsp; She just went nuts and grabbed me.�&nbsp; 

�My sister doesn&#8217;t go nuts.&nbsp; What did you do?�&nbsp; 

�Your sister is a crazy bitch.�&nbsp; 

Oh, oh, I started to rush for the door, when I saw the one who had grabbed him, punch him right in the face.&nbsp; The rest had grabbed my brother, realizing he was probably going to attack the guy.&nbsp; 

�If I ever hear you say one word about my sister, I will kill you.� My brother said, throwing the guy&#8217;s jacket at him.&nbsp; �Come on guys, let&#8217;s go finish the movies.�&nbsp; 

I saw my brother clap his friend, who had punched the guy, on the back.&nbsp; �Thanks man.&nbsp; You didn&#8217;t have to do that.�&nbsp; 

�Yeah, I did.�&nbsp; The guy answered.&nbsp; 

I went back to my room and shut the door.&nbsp; Now that it was over, reaction set in and I sat on the edge of the bed shaking.&nbsp; A few minutes later, there was a knock on the door.&nbsp; 

�Amy, can I come in?� my brother asked.&nbsp; 

Wiping my face to make sure there weren&#8217;t any tears, I said in the most cheerful voice I could manage.&nbsp; 

�Sure Brian, come on in.�&nbsp; 

He opened the door, closing it behind him.&nbsp; Sitting next to me on the bed, he stared at his hands.&nbsp; 

�I&#8217;m sorry Amy.&nbsp; Are you okay?�&nbsp; 

�I&#8217;m fine Brian.&nbsp; Don&#8217;t worry, he didn&#8217;t touch me.&nbsp; You didn&#8217;t do anything wrong.�&nbsp; 

�I invited him over.&nbsp; I knew he was a dog, but I didn&#8217;t think he&#8217;d try anything stupid.�&nbsp; 

�Brian, sometimes young men don&#8217;t think things through.&nbsp; It&#8217;s okay.&nbsp; No one got hurt.�&nbsp; 

�Not yet� he muttered.&nbsp; 

�Brian, please just let it go.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t want you to get in trouble because of him.&nbsp; He&#8217;s not worth it.�&nbsp; 

�But Amy.�&nbsp; 

�No Brian.&nbsp; If you get expelled for fighting, I will be very mad.�&nbsp; 

�If he says something I will kill him.� He said stubbornly.&nbsp; 

�You will do no such thing.&nbsp; Words can&#8217;t hurt us Brian, unless we let them.&nbsp; He is unimportant, therefore his words are unimportant.&nbsp; Ignore him.&nbsp; That will be punishment enough.�&nbsp; 

I lifted his chin so he had to look in my eyes.&nbsp; �Please Brian, for me.�&nbsp; 

He nodded reluctantly and hugged me tightly.&nbsp; 

�Besides, I&#8217;m quite sure your friend broke his nose.�&nbsp;&nbsp; 

He grinned at that.&nbsp; �Yeah, Paul was great.&nbsp; I&#8217;m really surprised.&nbsp; That&#8217;s his best friend.&nbsp; They&#8217;ve known each other forever.�&nbsp; 

�Go finish your movie Brian.&nbsp; Don&#8217;t forget to take out the trash before you go to bed.�&nbsp; 

He went back out to the living room and I heard one of the guys ask him if I was okay.&nbsp; 

�Sure. Amy&#8217;s tough.&nbsp; He&#8217;s lucky she didn&#8217;t rip his nuts off.�&nbsp; 

�Can you believe the grip she had on him?&nbsp; My nuts hurt just seeing it.� Said another.&nbsp; 

I finished my book and was getting ready for bed, when there was another knock on the door.&nbsp; 

�What is it Brian?�&nbsp; 

�It&#8217;s not Brian, it&#8217;s Paul.&nbsp; I just wanted to make sure you were okay.�&nbsp; 

I opened the door and looked up at the young man who stood in the hallway.&nbsp; �I&#8217;m fine.&nbsp; Thank you for asking.� I said.&nbsp; 

�I wanted to apologize.&nbsp; I asked Brian if it was okay for Brett to come.&nbsp; I never dreamed he would do anything like that.�&nbsp;&nbsp; 

�It&#8217;s quite alright.&nbsp; As I told Brian, we are not responsible for one another&#8217;s actions.�&nbsp; 

�But I brought him here.&nbsp; If there&#8217;s anything I can do to make it up to you, please let me know.� He said.&nbsp; 

�There is one thing you can do.&nbsp; Make sure Brian doesn&#8217;t go after him.&nbsp; His temper sometimes gets the better of him.�&nbsp; 

�Sure.&nbsp; Anything.&nbsp; Can I get you anything? I&#8217;m sure you don&#8217;t feel like going up front again.� He said.&nbsp; 

�No, no thank you.&nbsp; I have all I need.� 

�Well good night Amy.�&nbsp; 

�Good night Paul.�&nbsp; 

I shut the door and leaned against it.&nbsp; I wondered what such a nice young man was doing with such a jerk as a friend.&nbsp; I was very impressed that he had put a stranger&#8217;s feelings in front of a friend he had known for years.&nbsp; 

Chapter 2
That was my first meeting with my pet.&nbsp; I dreamed that night of him kneeling at my feet in a collar.&nbsp; He would make a superb pet.&nbsp; He was kind and solicitous, he seemed intelligent.&nbsp; I could tell he kept himself in good shape, even for a college student, and he was gorgeous.&nbsp; Tall, with dark blond hair and mesmerizing blue eyes.&nbsp; 

I woke up in the middle of the night with my pussy aching.&nbsp; I played with myself, all the while picturing him kneeling between my legs and pleasuring me with his tongue.&nbsp; It didn&#8217;t take long for me to climax.&nbsp; I sighed as I fell back asleep.&nbsp; He probably had a flock of women hanging around him.&nbsp; Plus I wanted a submissive, not a vanilla boyfriend.&nbsp; 

I woke up the next morning and wandered out to the kitchen to make my tea.&nbsp; As I walked down the hallway I smelled frying bacon and heard whistling.&nbsp; I wondered what my brother was doing up so early, and cooking.&nbsp; He never cooked.&nbsp; He couldn&#8217;t cook.&nbsp; His idea of breakfast was a bowl of cereal eaten in front of the TV.&nbsp; 

I turned the corner and stopped short.&nbsp; Paul was at the stove, whistling away while he scrambled eggs.&nbsp; He hadn&#8217;t seen me, so I took a moment to study him.&nbsp; I was a little put out that he was in my kitchen, since he shouldn&#8217;t have even been in the apartment, but watching the muscles move under the skin of his, shirtless, back, and seeing how his jeans hugged his backside, I couldn&#8217;t complain too much.&nbsp; 

I mentally shook myself and cleared my throat, wishing I had something on besides a long T-shirt.&nbsp; Paul turned around.&nbsp; 

�Good morning.&nbsp; I hope you don&#8217;t mind.&nbsp; My ride left without me and Brian said it was okay to crash on the couch.�&nbsp; 

�Since you got stranded on my account, it would be rather ungrateful of me to mind you sleeping on the couch.� I said.&nbsp; 

�Would you like some breakfast?&nbsp; I got hungry.� He said.&nbsp; 

�I normally just have toast and tea, but some bacon would be lovely.&nbsp; I can get it.�&nbsp; 

�No. Please let me.&nbsp; It would be my pleasure.� He said.&nbsp; 

He looked so eager, that I sat at the kitchen table and waited for him to bring me some breakfast.&nbsp; I took the opportunity to study him some more and started to wonder, again, how he&#8217;d look in a collar, kneeling at my feet.&nbsp; I was startled out of my daydream when he placed a plate in front of me, along with a cup of tea.&nbsp; 

�Thank you Paul, that was very nice of you.�&nbsp; 

He smiled and turned back to the stove.&nbsp; I was saved from further embarrassment by my brother stumbling in.&nbsp; 

�Hey that smells great.&nbsp; Did you save some for me?� he said.&nbsp; 

�There&#8217;s plenty left, you just have to make some eggs.� Paul replied, bringing his plate to the table and sitting down.&nbsp; 

�Ah man, I thought you might make me some.�&nbsp; 

�What do I look like, your servant?�&nbsp; Paul said.&nbsp; 

Was I mistaken, or did he glance at me when he said that?&nbsp; 

�I don&#8217;t know how to cook.� My brother whined.&nbsp; 

�Well I guess you&#8217;d better learn.� I said.&nbsp; 

My brother looked at me with his best, fake, little boy gaze.&nbsp; �Will you teach me, sis?� he said, batting his eyes.&nbsp; 

I laughed. �Yes, but you get to do all the washing up.�&nbsp; 

I rose to my feet, noting Paul stood up until I moved away from the table and then sat back down and continued eating.&nbsp; Better and better. He knew how to be a gentleman.&nbsp; 

I motioned my brother over to the stove and supervised him while he cooked for the first time in his life.&nbsp; He scorched the eggs a little bit, but he didn&#8217;t seem to mind.&nbsp; He loaded up a plate and took it to the table.&nbsp; 

�Remember Brian, you have to do the washing up. The kitchen better be spotless if you want a ride to class.�&nbsp; I looked at the clock.&nbsp; �Paul, I will be leaving in an hour.&nbsp; Is there somewhere I can drop you?�&nbsp; 

�If you could give me a lift to the dorms I would appreciate it.� He said.&nbsp; 

�It would be my pleasure.&nbsp; Brian, show him where the towels are, would you please.�&nbsp; 

I took my tea and headed back to my room to take a shower.&nbsp; I tried to be casual and act like it was no big deal to have a gorgeous young man see me in a shirt that barely covered my ass, but I could feel him staring at me as I walked away.&nbsp; 

When I got to my room, I immediately reached into my toy drawer and grabbed a dildo and a waterproof vibrator.&nbsp; Heading into the shower, I turned on the hot water and let it beat on my breasts while I attached the vibrator to the top of the dildo.&nbsp; I couldn&#8217;t believe how the thought of my brother&#8217;s friend being at my feet turned me on.&nbsp; 

I slid the dildo into my soaking wet cunt and turned the vibrator on.&nbsp; With one hand I pinched and rubbed my breasts and nipples, while I fucked myself with the dildo.&nbsp; The vibrator buzzed against my clit every time I shoved the dildo in.&nbsp; I leaned against the wall letting the water hit my torso.&nbsp; 

I pictured Paul sucking my breasts while he slid his cock into me.&nbsp; In my mind, I grabbed him by his hair and pushed him to his back on the floor of the shower.&nbsp; I rode his cock while feeding him my tits.&nbsp; 

As my climax neared, I shoved the dildo all the way in and held it there, pushing the vibrator into my clit and pulling on my nipples.&nbsp; I imagined grinding my pussy into his face and ordering him to make me cum.&nbsp; The orgasm exploded, hitting me so hard that I ended up sliding down the wall and sitting on the floor.&nbsp; 

When I caught my breath, I turned off the vibrator and slid the dildo out, washing them off and finishing my shower.&nbsp; I really needed to put him out of my mind.&nbsp; Anyone who could make such an impression after such a short meeting was dangerous.&nbsp; 

I thought that being a good Domme demanded a bit of detachment.&nbsp; I didn&#8217;t think that you could be a strict Domme if you were in love with your sub.&nbsp; I was still relatively inexperienced and didn&#8217;t know that loving your sub could make the experience so much better.&nbsp; At the time I thought you should be fond of your sub, care for him like a favored pet, but not be in love with him.&nbsp; I was quite sure that falling for your sub was a good way to end up with the sub being in charge.&nbsp; 

I dropped Paul off at his dorm, and my brother off at his class, before heading to my workshop to finish the piece I was working on.&nbsp; 

Chapter 3
I tried to forget about Paul, but he and my brother seemed to be hanging out a lot.&nbsp; I was always seeing him in my living room, or hanging out on the front lawn of the apartments.&nbsp; This went on for a few weeks, until I decided to do something about it.&nbsp; 

I discussed the problem with my mentor and came up with a course of action.&nbsp; I waited for an evening when I knew my brother had a test.&nbsp; He and Paul had been studying in the living room.&nbsp; 

�Brian, I need to go get some supplies for the workshop, are you going to be able to help?�&nbsp; 

�Tonight? Sorry sis, I have a test.� He said.&nbsp; 

�Oh, that&#8217;s right.&nbsp; Damn.�&nbsp; 

�Can&#8217;t it wait until tomorrow?�&nbsp; 

�No, my client wants his piece as soon as possible and I&#8217;m out of some of the metals.&nbsp; Don&#8217;t worry, I&#8217;ll find someone to help me unload.&nbsp; Good luck on your test.�&nbsp; 

�I can help.� Paul said.&nbsp; 

�No, I couldn&#8217;t impose on you like that.�&nbsp; 

�Really, it&#8217;s not a problem.� He said.&nbsp; 

�Are you sure? It&#8217;s hard work.� I said.&nbsp; 

�She&#8217;s not kidding man, that metal weighs a ton.� My brother said.&nbsp; 

I wanted to kick him and tell him to shut up.&nbsp; 

�Yeah, let&#8217;s go.� Paul said, closing his books.&nbsp; 

�Okay, thanks.&nbsp; Come on Brian, we&#8217;ll drop you off.&nbsp;&nbsp; You&#8217;ll have to walk back.�&nbsp; 

As Paul and I walked into the store where I got my supplies, the owner came out to greet me.&nbsp; He was a long time sub of my mentor and had been on the receiving end of my paddle a few times, when she had been too tired to do it herself.&nbsp; 

�Hello Miss A.&nbsp; Your order is ready.&nbsp; I&#8217;ll have the boys load it up.�&nbsp; 

�Thank you Tony.�&nbsp; 

�Do you need anything else Miss A?&nbsp; I have some new samples that came in.&nbsp; There&#8217;s one I think would be great for fine work.&nbsp; I can give you some to experiment with.&nbsp; If you like it, Mistress wants to know if you could make a collar from it.�&nbsp; 

�Sure Tony� I said, taking out my notebook and acting like I hadn&#8217;t noticed him calling me Miss A and talking about his Mistress.&nbsp; 

�What was she thinking about?�&nbsp; 

My mentor had briefed him well.&nbsp; His performance was superb, acting like he always spoke of such things with his customers.&nbsp; I would be sure to tell her so that he could be well rewarded.&nbsp; 

�She said she would leave it up to you, but that she would like runes with our names.&nbsp; She&#8217;s sure whatever you design will be lovely.�&nbsp; 

�Tell her I said thank you.&nbsp; How big?�&nbsp; 

He put his hands around his neck and said.&nbsp; �What do you think? 18 inches?�&nbsp; 

I glanced at Paul to find him looking at Tony speculatively.&nbsp; 

�Yes, that looks about right.&nbsp; Well let&#8217;s see this new stuff and see if it&#8217;s suitable to make something nice.�&nbsp; 

He brought out some samples of pewter and iron.&nbsp; He also had a sample of a flexible, thin steel that I thought would be perfect for a collar.&nbsp; I took the samples and put them in my car.&nbsp; Paul spent the hour drive back to my workshop in deep thought.&nbsp; 

Chapter 4
When we arrived he helped me unload the car.&nbsp; After we had finished, I told him to make himself at home and look around while I updated my paperwork.&nbsp; He strolled around the workshop looking at finished pieces, and works in progress, while I wrote some notes on my ideas for Tony&#8217;s collar and entered the metal I had just bought into my books.&nbsp; 

When I finished I went looking for Paul.&nbsp; I saw him studying my latest piece.&nbsp; I smiled to myself as I saw him run his hand over the smooth metal, a far off look in his eyes.&nbsp; The piece was of a male and female submissive kneeling at the feet of their Dom.&nbsp; He had his hands on their heads while they looked at him in adoration.&nbsp; 

�What do you think?� I asked.&nbsp; 

�It&#8217;s very good. They look so life-like.&nbsp; How did you do it?�&nbsp; 

�Oh, I took a mold with some special body paint that you can peel off and it will hold its shape.&nbsp; It&#8217;s a bit hard to work with because it&#8217;s very temperamental.� I said.&nbsp; 

�So these are real people?�&nbsp; 

�Yes, very much so.�&nbsp; 

�Are they professional models?�&nbsp; 

�No, they have been with that man for years.�&nbsp; 

�Are there women in that man&#8217;s position?� he asked pointing to the Dom.&nbsp; 

I hesitated not wanting to seem eager, but inside I was dancing around like a kid in a candy store.&nbsp; I had read him correctly.&nbsp; He was interested.&nbsp; 

�Yes, there are.� I said, as if I had this conversation every day.&nbsp; 

Suddenly he looked at me intensely.&nbsp; �Please tell me you are one.�&nbsp; 

�Why? What difference would it make?�&nbsp; 

He dropped to his knees, grabbing my hands.&nbsp; �I want you to ask you to do that,� he said pointing at the sculpture.&nbsp; �Teach me how to be like that.�&nbsp; 

I kept my face impassive. �Why would you want that?�&nbsp; 

�I feel like something is missing, and I have these dreams where I&#8217;m being ordered around.&nbsp; I saw this and it just felt right.� He said.&nbsp; 

�Are you sure Paul? Are you sure you want me to do it? I can introduce you to someone else.�&nbsp; 

He looked straight into my eyes and said, �No. I don&#8217;t want to learn from anyone else.&nbsp; It&#8217;s you or no one.�&nbsp; 

I tried not to show how relieved I was, or how happy.&nbsp; I thought on my mentor&#8217;s words. &#8216;Go slow, Amy. Don&#8217;t get your hopes too high.&nbsp; People have a romanticized notion of what they think this is all about, but when reality sets in; they realize they only want to play at it, and only for short periods of time.&nbsp; There is nothing wrong with that, but it won&#8217;t make you happy.&#8217;&nbsp; 

�Okay Paul.&nbsp; Let&#8217;s say a trial period of two weeks, while you see what is involved and what the rules are.&nbsp; Then another of a month, so that I can show you what would be expected of my submissive.&nbsp; After that it will be up to you to convince me that you really want this and that you are worthy of me.� I said.&nbsp; 

Might as well let him know now that he was going to have to work at it.&nbsp; 

�Yes, yes, anything.�&nbsp; 

He looked so eager and so desperate that I was glad I was imposing these restrictions.&nbsp; I hardened myself against the feelings I had and reminded myself that I would be responsible for him.&nbsp; 

�Your first assignment is to research Dominants and submissives and limits.&nbsp; I want you to email me a list of your limits, hard and soft, by 6pm tomorrow.&nbsp; If you are unsure of what something is, you may ask me.�&nbsp;&nbsp; 

�Yes�.um, what do I call you?�&nbsp; 

For now you will continue to call me Amy.&nbsp; After the two weeks, if you decide you want to continue, you will call me Miss A.�&nbsp; 

He looked up at me, shifting slightly.&nbsp; �Oh get up Paul.&nbsp; You don&#8217;t have to kneel to me.&nbsp; Yet.&nbsp; One other thing.&nbsp; Brian is not to know.&nbsp; If you let anything slip our agreement is over.&nbsp; Do you understand?�&nbsp; 

He nodded as he stood up. 

�Unless you are forbidden to speak you will always answer me verbally Paul.�&nbsp; 

�I&#8217;m sorry.&nbsp; Yes. I understand.&nbsp; Amy, how did you find out about this stuff?� he asked, as we walked back to the car.&nbsp; 

�Before my parents died, I lived in the city.&nbsp; One of my neighbors was openly into BDSM.&nbsp; I got curious and asked her.&nbsp; She took me with her to a couple of clubs that had classes and she introduced me to some trainers.&nbsp; I spent some time experimenting with different aspects until I realized I was happiest as a Domme.&nbsp; So I found a mentor and set out to learn as much as I could.�&nbsp; 

�When my parents died, and I moved here to help Brian, I put everything on hold.&nbsp; Brian has been having a hard time dealing with their deaths, and nothing is more important to me than he is.&nbsp; I&#8217;m hoping he&#8217;s finally starting to get it together.&nbsp; Because of that, I&#8217;ve not had the opportunity to gain a whole lot of experience, which is why I said I would introduce you to someone else.&nbsp; If you still want to stay with me, there may be times when my mentor will be involved with our sessions.�&nbsp; 

�He&#8217;s a good guy. When I first met him, I thought he was wild, and a trouble-maker, but since you&#8217;ve been here, he&#8217;s calmed down a lot.&nbsp; Every once in a while he goes a little nuts, like that movie night.&nbsp; I thought he was going to kill Brett.&nbsp; He really loves you.&nbsp; Every time somebody suggests something, he stops and thinks about what you would think of it.� Paul said, ignoring my mention of my inexperience and my mentor&#8217;s involvement.&nbsp; 

Tears started to come to my eyes.&nbsp; �Thank you Paul.&nbsp; That&#8217;s good to hear.�&nbsp; 

We drove back in silence and I let Paul out at his dorm.&nbsp; 

Chapter 5
When I got home, Brian was watching TV.&nbsp; I gave him a big hug.&nbsp; 

�How was your test?� I asked.&nbsp; 

�Good.&nbsp; I think I aced it.&nbsp; I&#8217;m sorry I couldn&#8217;t help you pick up supplies.� 

�That&#8217;s okay. Paul helped a lot.�&nbsp; 

�He really likes you, you know.�&nbsp; 

�He seems like a nice guy.� I said, trying to sound noncommittal.&nbsp; 

�Yeah, he is.&nbsp; He&#8217;s not like most of the jocks.&nbsp; They always think they are better than everyone.&nbsp; He&#8217;s smart too.&nbsp; It&#8217;s no fair.&nbsp; Some guys have everything.�&nbsp; 

�Brian, you&#8217;re smart and good-looking, what does he have that you don&#8217;t?�&nbsp; 

�I don&#8217;t know.&nbsp; It all seems to come so easy for him.&nbsp; Like girls.&nbsp; So many girls throw themselves at him.&nbsp; They don&#8217;t even look at me.�&nbsp; 

�Now I know that&#8217;s not true.&nbsp; What about that cute girl you took out last week?�&nbsp; 

�Well�.�&nbsp; 

�And what about Carol?&nbsp; And what&#8217;s her name? Brenda.�&nbsp; 

�Well alright, I do okay.�&nbsp; 

�Anyway, Paul always seems to be hanging out with you and the rest of the guys.&nbsp; So where are all these girls?�&nbsp; 

�You know that&#8217;s true.&nbsp; He doesn&#8217;t seem to date much.&nbsp; But the girls do throw themselves at him.�&nbsp; 

�Because he plays football?� I asked.&nbsp; 

�Jeez Amy.&nbsp; Have you looked at the guy?&nbsp; He looks like a model.&nbsp; Hey, I wonder if he&#8217;s gay.�&nbsp; 

�Would it matter?�&nbsp; 

�No, I don&#8217;t care.&nbsp; But some of the other guys would.�&nbsp; 

�Well, I wouldn&#8217;t worry about it.&nbsp; He seems to be a good friend for you to have.&nbsp; I&#8217;ve never seen you study so much.�&nbsp; 

�I think he likes to study here so that he can see you.�&nbsp; Brian said with a smirk.&nbsp; 

I forced a laugh.&nbsp; �Don&#8217;t be silly.&nbsp; Why would he be interested in me?&nbsp; I&#8217;m 12 years older than you.&nbsp; For guys your age it&#8217;s almost like I&#8217;m your mother.�&nbsp; 

Brian snorted.&nbsp; �Trust me sis, none of my friends think you are their mother.�&nbsp; 

I needed to end this conversation before it got anymore out of hand.&nbsp; 

�I have to jump in the shower.&nbsp; Why don&#8217;t you order some take out.�&nbsp; 

I walked back to my room and sat at my computer.&nbsp; There was an email from Paul asking me for some definitions. I answered him quickly and went to take my shower.&nbsp; I watched a movie with my brother and then I went to bed.&nbsp; 

My dreams were filled with pictures of Paul.&nbsp; I ran him through all sorts of submissive fantasies, some of which I hadn&#8217;t done more than think about in real life.&nbsp; When I woke up, I hoped he would agree to be my submissive.&nbsp; I didn&#8217;t think I could take seeing him around if he wasn&#8217;t.&nbsp; 

I went to my workshop and worked on finishing the big piece my client wanted in a hurry.&nbsp; Then I experimented with a couple of the samples Tony had given me.&nbsp; The steel was thin enough to fold and flexible enough to bend without putting joints in it.&nbsp; It would be ideal for fancy collars.&nbsp; 

I started picturing the designs I could carve into it, or weld onto it.&nbsp; I called Tony and placed an order for some more as soon as I was sure it wouldn&#8217;t become brittle.&nbsp; 

I then fashioned a really nice one for my mentor, using the runes she liked.&nbsp; Even though it had just been part of the scene, and she didn&#8217;t really ask me for a collar, I wanted to do something nice for her for all her help.&nbsp; I painstakingly carved their names on the collar.&nbsp; Using the runic alphabet she liked was nerve-wracking.&nbsp; It was really intricate and it was quite easy to change a meaning by mistake.&nbsp; 

When I was done, I made another collar for Paul.&nbsp; When I had finished it, I laughed at myself.&nbsp; Even if everything worked out, it would be at least a year before he wore my collar.&nbsp; 

After cleaning up, I went back to the apartment.&nbsp; Checking my email, I noticed an email from Paul.&nbsp; Thinking he might have more questions he needed answered I opened it.&nbsp; I was surprised to see a detailed list of limits.&nbsp; He explained why some were hard, and why others he might be willing to try at some later date.&nbsp; He also included things he was curious about and an essay on what he thought being submissive might be like, what he thought would be a good Domme for him and why.&nbsp; 

It showed a lot of initiative and thought.&nbsp; He must have spent hours researching things.&nbsp; I was impressed.&nbsp; I printed his email, so I could memorize his limits and use his essay as a way to learn how his mind worked.&nbsp; I already had a rough idea of how I wanted to proceed.&nbsp; I didn&#8217;t want to overwhelm him, but I wanted to make sure the next six weeks gave him a realistic view of what his life would be like if he kept going on this path he had chosen.&nbsp; 

Chapter 6
I spent the next two weeks talking to Paul when he wasn&#8217;t in class or at practice.&nbsp; Football season was over, but Paul worked just as hard in the off season.&nbsp; He wanted to be the best he could.&nbsp; I made sure he kept up on his studies, but I spent a lot of time telling him about BDSM, about the differences between tops and bottoms, Doms and subs and Masters and slaves.&nbsp; He asked a lot of good questions.&nbsp; 

After the two weeks was up, I asked him if he was still interested.&nbsp; He was silent for a long time, looking at me intently.&nbsp; My heart sank.&nbsp; I was sure he had changed his mind.&nbsp; He stood up from the table where we had been sitting and knelt on the floor.&nbsp; 

�Miss A, I would be honored if you would consider taking me as a trainee.�&nbsp; 

I smiled down at him.&nbsp; �It would be my pleasure.� I said.&nbsp; �When we are alone, you will always call me Miss A or ma&#8217;am, if we are in public it will be Amy unless I tell you otherwise.&nbsp; Do you understand?�&nbsp; 

�Yes Miss A.�&nbsp; 

I quickly went over other rules for his month trial.&nbsp; �You are free to stop this at any time; you have only to tell me.&nbsp; Now I have a few expectations.&nbsp; You are to keep up your grades and your practices.&nbsp; If anything I tell you to do will interfere with this, you will tell me at once.&nbsp; I expect you to mind your manners at all times, whether I am with you or not.&nbsp; You will always be a gentleman. Do you understand?�&nbsp; 

�Yes ma&#8217;am.� 

�If you are unsure about something I have asked of you, ask me.&nbsp; I will not have you fail at a task out of simple ignorance.&nbsp; We will start slow.&nbsp; Be assured that I will respect the limits you have given me.&nbsp; Do you know what safe words are?� 

�Yes Miss A.� 

�Very well, if something is simply too intense for you at any time, you will use the Yellow to inform me of this.&nbsp; I will immediately scale back until you say Green.&nbsp; Understand?�&nbsp; 

�Yes Miss A.�&nbsp; 

�If at anytime you want me to stop, you will say Red.&nbsp; Do not try to impress me, do not try to take on more than you can handle.&nbsp; As I get to know you better, I will be able to read your body language, but even then you are to use your safe words if you feel the need.&nbsp; If at any time, I think you are not being honest with me about what you can handle, I will stop.&nbsp; If it happens too often, I will dismiss you.&nbsp; Do you understand?�&nbsp; 

�Yes Miss A.&nbsp; Can I ask a question?�&nbsp; 

I looked at him in silence wondering if he would realize what he had said wrong.&nbsp; If he didn&#8217;t pick up on it himself, I would tell him.&nbsp; Certain points of grammar weren&#8217;t emphasized in most curriculums, so it was possible he didn&#8217;t know.&nbsp; He looked at me quizzically as I remained silent.&nbsp; 

�Miss A?�&nbsp; 

�Yes.�&nbsp; 

�Is something wrong?�&nbsp; 

I sighed.&nbsp; �What did you ask me before?�&nbsp; 

�I asked if I could ask a question Miss A.� 

�Yes you did, however, you asked it in such a way that your capability to do so was called into question.�&nbsp; 

He looked so confused that I took pity on him.&nbsp; 

�The proper way to ask permission is &#8216;May I&#8217;, not &#8216;Can I&#8217;.�&nbsp; 

�Yes Miss A.&nbsp; Thank you. May I ask a question?�&nbsp; 

�Of course.�&nbsp; 

�What did you mean, if it happens too often you would dismiss me?�&nbsp; 

�If I think your ego is causing you to not use your safe words, or if I think you are using them frivolously to get out of something, I will stop our agreement immediately.�&nbsp; 

�I would never do that!� he said.&nbsp; 

�Listen to me Paul, while I agree that you would be more inclined to the former than the latter, there are things that I will tell you to do, or that I will do to you, that will be uncomfortable.&nbsp; Maybe even painful.&nbsp; Especially punishments.&nbsp; Can you honestly say that if it was something you wanted to avoid that you might not think about using your safe word?�&nbsp; 

�Yes ma&#8217;am, I can.� He said.&nbsp; 

�I&#8217;m not a sadist Paul, I will not cause you pain simply to get enjoyment out of it, and I would never do anything to cause you real harm, but I will torment you for my amusement.&nbsp; I am very strict, and if I feel you deserve punishment, I will punish you.&nbsp; You will always be told what you are being punished for, and if there are extenuating circumstances I will listen.&nbsp; Do not mistake this for lenience.&nbsp; I will be doing a lot of explaining this month.&nbsp; When I give you a task, I will explain why I want you to do it, and what I think you will gain out of it.&nbsp; My primary goal as your Domme is to help you grow and allow you to express every facet of your being openly and honestly.&nbsp; As we come to know and trust one another, I will push you harder and harder.&nbsp; Eventually I will no longer explain myself, but you will always be allowed to ask questions.�&nbsp; 

�Yes ma&#8217;am, I understand, but I would still never use my safe word just to avoid something.�&nbsp; 

�Now I have a question Paul.&nbsp; What expectations do you have regarding physical intimacies?�&nbsp; 

�Ma&#8217;am?�&nbsp; 

I noticed he was shifting a bit on his knees.&nbsp; It seemed so natural for him to be there, that I had almost forgotten that he wasn&#8217;t used to kneeling for long periods of time.&nbsp; To his credit he had not complained.&nbsp; 

�Paul, get up and sit at the table.� 

As he got up I continued. �I&#8217;m sure in your research you have realized that some aspects of BDSM can involve various components of sexual activity.&nbsp; I simply wish to know what you are expecting.�&nbsp; 

He looked down at the floor.&nbsp; Wait. Was he blushing?&nbsp; Oh this was just too much.&nbsp; 

�Are you a virgin Paul?�&nbsp; 

Shocked he looked up.&nbsp; 

�No Miss A.�&nbsp; 

�Are you gay?�&nbsp; 

�No ma&#8217;am.� He said, looking at the floor once more.&nbsp; 

�Why are you blushing Paul?�&nbsp; 

He mumbled something incomprehensible.&nbsp; 

�Paul!� I said sharply. �Look at me and speak up.�&nbsp; 

He raised his eyes, his cheeks flaming.&nbsp; �Sorry Miss A.&nbsp; I said that I wasn&#8217;t experienced and that I was uncomfortable telling you what I had thought.�&nbsp; 

I took his face in my hands, making him look in my eyes.&nbsp; �Paul, you can tell me anything.&nbsp; I won&#8217;t make fun of your, I won&#8217;t think less of you and I certainly won&#8217;t tell anyone else. Now please answer the question.� 
 
�Yes ma&#8217;am.&nbsp; I thought that you would use me for your pleasure and teach me what you liked.�&nbsp; 

This was just getting better and better.&nbsp; He was perfect.&nbsp; Time for the first test of his place at my feet.&nbsp; 

�Paul, you will not have sex with me for a very long time, if ever.&nbsp; You may earn the privilege of pleasuring me, but it will be under my rules.&nbsp; Is that a problem?�&nbsp; 

�No ma&#8217;am.� He hesitated and I knew what he wanted to know but was too shy to ask.&nbsp; 

�You may date outside of our parameters, you can even have sex.&nbsp; I only require that if you have sex, that you are safe.&nbsp; Do not get anyone pregnant, and do not bring back any diseases.&nbsp; Speaking of which, we will go tomorrow and get tested.&nbsp; You will get tested every six months.&nbsp; If you start dating someone seriously, I expect to be kept informed and told if things change.�&nbsp; 

�Miss A, how can I date as your sub?�&nbsp; 

�You will not be with me all the time.&nbsp; After this month, if you ask to continue and I accept you, I will be your Domme, not your girlfriend.&nbsp; Even then it will not be 24/7.&nbsp; When you are not with me you will be free to do whatever you like.�&nbsp; 

As much as I hated telling him these things, I was trying to maintain a sense of detachment.&nbsp; I thought it would be easier if I knew he was still free to see other people.&nbsp; At the time, I still believed that loving your sub was a recipe for disaster.&nbsp; I tried to squash the feeling of happiness I felt when he looked disappointed and said. 

�I don&#8217;t know if I can date anyone while I&#8217;m doing this, but thank you for letting me know where I stand.�&nbsp; 

�I don&#8217;t care whether you do or not, just so you know that you are free to do so.�&nbsp; 

I tried to sound nonchalant, but I wasn&#8217;t sure if I carried it off, especially when he looked closely at me for a moment.&nbsp; 

Chapter 7
The next month sped by.&nbsp; I gradually intensified our sessions, giving him tasks that required ingenuity, keeping him in submissive positions longer, becoming stricter about mistakes.&nbsp; I did not touch him sexually, or allow him to touch me.&nbsp; 

My toys and I became very closely acquainted that month.&nbsp; I found the point where intense turned into pain and learned to read his body language.&nbsp; He learned how to anticipate my wishes and pay close attention to the smallest indications of mood and desires.&nbsp; He was smart, rarely needing to be told, or shown things, more than once.&nbsp; 

I worried a bit that he would just let me run right over the top of him in a desire to please, but he was assured enough to stand up for himself when he felt I was wrong, or I was pushing him too hard.&nbsp; He never failed to stay polite and respectful, even when he disagreed with me.&nbsp; When I was wrong I apologized.&nbsp; If I made a mistake, whether he noticed it or not, I always admitted it.&nbsp; 

I wanted him to see that I was still human and fallible.&nbsp; That being a Domme, didn&#8217;t instantly convey perfection upon me.&nbsp; I wanted to be sure that if he moved on and found another Domme someday, he wouldn&#8217;t overlook glaring red flags simply because he thought Dommes could do anything they wanted.&nbsp; I also wanted him to know he could trust me, not only to be fair, but to have his best interests at heart.&nbsp; 

At the end of the month I sat him down again and asked him if he wanted to continue and why he felt he was worthy to do so if he did.&nbsp; He set forth a logical and impassioned argument for himself and I have to admit he begged quite prettily.&nbsp; I accepted him after a lengthy conversation and told him to be prepared to go into the city with me the next night.&nbsp; 

Chapter 8
I was going to formally accept him into training in front of witnesses, but I didn&#8217;t tell him that.&nbsp; I wanted him to be surprised.&nbsp; I called my mentor and set it all up.&nbsp; I had kept in close contact with her the whole time, to make sure I was doing the right thing, and asking for help when I felt it necessary.&nbsp; 

The next day I called Paul and told him to be ready to go at 5:30 and to be dressed for a nice dinner.&nbsp; I went by a little early to pick him up, and, to be honest, to make sure he was dressed appropriately.&nbsp; I had Brian for an example of how college guys dressed.&nbsp; 

I shouldn&#8217;t have worried, Paul walked out of the dorm looking like an Armani ad.&nbsp; Subtly understated, his suit fit him like a second skin.&nbsp; Right then I made a vow, that not only would this perfect man be my sub, he would be mine.&nbsp; Not just his body and his mind, but his heart and soul also.&nbsp; I told myself that I would have to be as worthy of him as he was of me.&nbsp; 

That was the start of a two and a half year journey.&nbsp; What happened during those years was simply confirmation of the rightness of my desire to be with him forever.&nbsp; I still had concerns about the ability to be a good Domme to a sub I loved, but many conversations with my mentor convinced me that it would actually make me better.&nbsp; 

After a sumptuous dinner at one of my favorite restaurants, we left for our next stop.&nbsp; I drove to a remote suburb.&nbsp; When I got close, I pulled over to the side of the road.&nbsp; 

�Are you ready to start your journey Paul?�&nbsp; 

�Yes Miss A, I am.�&nbsp; 

�Okay, take off everything but your pants and then put this on.� I said, handing him a blindfold.&nbsp; 

He didn&#8217;t even hesitate, struggling to get undressed in the cramped confines of my car.&nbsp; After folding his clothes neatly and placing them in the back seat, he took the blindfold, and looking into my eyes with complete trust, put the blindfold on.&nbsp; 

I drove to my mentor&#8217;s house, helping Paul out of the car and guiding him to the door.&nbsp; Ringing the bell, I placed my hand on Paul&#8217;s back to comfort him.&nbsp; I could feel the tension in his muscles as we waited.&nbsp; 

Tony opened the door and greeted me warmly.&nbsp; 

�Miss A. Welcome.&nbsp; Mistress is waiting in the living room. May I take your things?�&nbsp; 

I handed him my purse, but kept the small cloth bag with me.&nbsp; I led Paul carefully into the house and then put him in Tony&#8217;s care.&nbsp; 

�Paul, you remember Tony from the metal shop.&nbsp; He&#8217;s going to help you get ready.&nbsp; Tony that collar looks marvelous on you.� I said, admiring how the collar I made looked on his neck.&nbsp; 

No matter what they looked like when I made them, until they were actually on, I couldn&#8217;t tell whether they worked or not.&nbsp; 

�Oh Miss A.&nbsp; It was such a surprise to get it and so wonderful for you to give it to Mistress.&nbsp; It&#8217;s beautiful and Mistress really loves that you put our names on it.&nbsp; I just love it too.&nbsp; I would even if Mistress hadn&#8217;t given it to me.�&nbsp; 

�Well I&#8217;m glad you both like it.&nbsp; The card you sent me was very nice.&nbsp; I&#8217;m so grateful for all the help you and your Mistress have given me.�&nbsp; 

I left them by the door to go greet my friend and mentor.&nbsp; Walking into the living room, I saw her sitting by the fire.&nbsp; 

�Anna, how wonderful to see you again.&nbsp; Thank you so much for the beautiful card and for doing this tonight.�&nbsp; 

�It is my pleasure dear.&nbsp; Thank you for the collar.&nbsp; Tony was ecstatic over it and he jumped through so many hoops to get it.� She said chuckling.&nbsp; �Now where is your new sub?&nbsp; I can&#8217;t wait to meet him.�&nbsp; 

�Tony&#8217;s helping him get ready Anna.� I paused, �Am I doing the right thing?&nbsp; He&#8217;s very special and I&#8217;m not all that experienced.�&nbsp; 

�Now dear, you listen to me.&nbsp; You have a good head on your shoulders.&nbsp; Follow your heart and you will do fine.&nbsp; Here, have some wine to calm your nerves.�&nbsp; 

I accepted the glass of wine from her and sipped from it while I went through the pre-ceremony jitters.&nbsp; This is what people must feel before they get married, I thought.&nbsp; 

Anna had arranged the room so that there was a clear space in the middle, with a large, formal chair at one end of the open space.&nbsp; I sat in the chair and drank the wine, nervousness making rings dance across the rich, red surface.&nbsp; 

Tony led Paul in and assisted him in kneeling in the middle of the floor.&nbsp; Paul was wearing a pair of leather shorts instead of his pants and he still had his blindfold on.&nbsp; We ignored him for a while, waiting for the rest of the guests to arrive.&nbsp; It was a small gathering, just myself, Anna, a Dom I knew very well, named Matt, and our subs.&nbsp; 

Matt and his subs were the subject of my latest piece.&nbsp; After greeting him warmly, we were ready to begin.&nbsp; 

With me in front of him, and everyone else off to the side, I signaled Tony to remove Paul&#8217;s blindfold.&nbsp; Blinking a little in the light, Paul locked his eyes on mine and let out a little sigh.&nbsp; 

�Paul, we are here tonight so that you can formally be accepted into training.&nbsp; These others are here to witness this and to ensure I&#8217;m not taking advantage of you.&nbsp; Do you still wish to proceed?� I said.&nbsp; 

�Yes ma&#8217;am.� Paul&#8217;s eyes never left mine.&nbsp; 

I took the training collar I had made out of the bag and held it up.&nbsp; It caught the light and shone softly, the flames from the fire flickered on its surface.&nbsp; I had made it like the Celtic torques the ancient clan chiefs used to wear.&nbsp; One piece that could be spread to fit around the neck but would then snap together to make a closed ring.&nbsp; 

�This is a training collar Paul.&nbsp; When I place it around your neck it means I have formally accepted you into training and taken you under consideration.&nbsp; Training will last for as long as it takes for me to decide that you are ready to be someone&#8217;s sub.&nbsp; When training is over you can petition to be my sub, or you may leave with my blessing to find a more compatible person to be your Dominant.&nbsp; Do you understand?�&nbsp; 

�Yes Miss A.� he said softly.&nbsp; 

�Anytime you have the collar on you will address me as Mistress.&nbsp; Also you will address any Dominant you speak to while wearing the collar as Sir or Ma&#8217;am.&nbsp; Is that clear?�&nbsp; 

�Yes ma&#8217;am.� 

�Do you wish to formally enter into training and be placed under consideration?�&nbsp; 

�With all my heart Miss A.� 

With that he bent forward and placed his forehead on my feet.&nbsp; It was a nice touch.&nbsp; I wondered if he had thought of that on his own or had asked Tony.&nbsp; In fact, it made a lump in my throat and tears come to my eyes.&nbsp; I looked at Anna and she nodded her head, smiling encouragingly.&nbsp; I reached down and placed the collar around his neck, snapping it closed.&nbsp; 

It was fine enough that it could be taken for a necklace if he wanted to leave it on and strong enough that I could restrain him by it.&nbsp; I took a grip on his hair and pulled his head up until we were face to face.&nbsp; Then I kissed him for the first time.&nbsp; His eyes widened in shock and then closed as he surrendered to my kiss.&nbsp; Everyone clapped and I broke off the kiss so that I could introduce him.&nbsp; 

I bid him stand up and took him first to Anna.&nbsp; 

�This is Tony&#8217;s Mistress.&nbsp; You will address her as Mistress Anna, or MzAnna at all times.&nbsp; At all times Paul, even when you are not wearing your collar.�&nbsp; 

�Yes Mistress� he said. �It is a pleasure to meet you Mistress Anna.�&nbsp; 

�And I you Paul.�&nbsp; 

�This is Matt, Paul.�&nbsp; 

�A pleasure Sir.�&nbsp; 

�Nice to meet you my boy.&nbsp; You make sure to make your Mistress happy now, hear?�&nbsp; 

�Yes Sir.&nbsp; I will do my best� Paul replied.&nbsp; 

�These two are Denise and Joseph.� Matt said, indicating the two subs still kneeling at his feet.&nbsp; 

�Hello� they said in unison.&nbsp; 

�Hello� said Paul.&nbsp; 

�You&#8217;ve already met Tony.&nbsp; Feel free to mingle with them for a bit.�&nbsp; I said. 

�Yes Mistress.�&nbsp; 

A thrill went through me, hearing him say that word, acknowledging himself as mine.&nbsp; I chatted with Matt and Anna while the subs took Paul off to the other side of the room to talk.&nbsp; 

�Matt your piece is ready and I really think you are going to like how it turned out.� I said.&nbsp; 

�Great, I&#8217;ll come by tomorrow to pick it up.�&nbsp; 

�Sorry Matt tomorrow is Sunday.&nbsp; I won&#8217;t be around.&nbsp; How about some time on Monday.�&nbsp; 

�That&#8217;s right; Sundays you take your brother to visit your parents.&nbsp; Sorry, I forgot.&nbsp; How&#8217;s Brian doing by the way?�&nbsp; 

�He&#8217;s much better. He&#8217;s starting to calm down.&nbsp; His grades are improving.&nbsp; Hanging out with Paul seems to helping him.�&nbsp; 

�He is wonderful dear, I&#8217;m so happy you found him.� Said Anna.&nbsp; 

I watched Paul over my wine glass. �So am I Anna, so am I.�&nbsp; 

Chapter 9
During the next two years I trained Paul as my sub.&nbsp; I made sure he did his school work, finding him tutors whenever he had problems with a subject.&nbsp; He became more focused, whether because of his training, or simply maturing, I couldn&#8217;t say.&nbsp; His football improved.&nbsp; He became starting quarterback and, in his senior year, led his team to a NCAA Div 2 championship.&nbsp; He attracted scouts from some of the pro teams and he graduated on the honor roll.&nbsp; 

His training went pretty smoothly, he learned very quickly and didn&#8217;t make many mistakes.&nbsp; We learned to read each other very well until is almost seemed like we were reading each other&#8217;s minds.&nbsp; We hit a snag when it came to his having sex with another sub.&nbsp; 

I wanted to reward him for something and I knew he hadn&#8217;t been having sex much, even though he was free to do so.&nbsp; I knew he was as in love with me and I was with him.&nbsp; I hadn&#8217;t used him for sex, although I had used him to masturbate.&nbsp; I was holding off on the actual intercourse until I was sure is training was complete.&nbsp; 

I had formally accepted him as my sub a few months prior, giving him a necklace I had made, that he could wear all the time.&nbsp; It was just prior to the NFL draft and he had been really uptight, but had done something really special for Anna.&nbsp; Completely unasked, he had seen a need that Tony couldn&#8217;t fulfill and had unselfishly volunteered himself, after asking me if it would be okay.&nbsp; 

Tony had been sick and Anna was going to a formal BDSM ball.&nbsp; She didn&#8217;t want to go without her sub, but because of her standing she had to make an appearance.&nbsp; Paul hated being put on display, being in nothing but a collar, and cuffs, around other people really bothered him. I was very private and didn&#8217;t like crowds, so it wasn&#8217;t much of an issue.&nbsp; I had made him do it a couple of times as part of his training, and that was it.&nbsp; 

He talked it over with me, and then asked Anna if he could be of service and go with her to the ball.&nbsp; Needless to say she was delighted.&nbsp; They had returned with Anna giving glowing reports of his behavior.&nbsp; She gloated over the fact that Paul outshone every other sub in the place, especially our friend Nikki&#8217;s.&nbsp; She and Nikki had a friendly, but fierce, competition going on.&nbsp; Good-naturedly trying to outdo one another.&nbsp; 

Paul basked in the praise, but I wanted to give him a more tangible sign of my pleasure.&nbsp; I asked Matt if he would loan me Denise, if she wasn&#8217;t averse to having sex with Paul.&nbsp; When I told Paul that I had a reward for him and told him what it was, he balked.&nbsp; For selfish reasons, I wanted to be sure his feelings for me could withstand physical intimacy with others. So while I loved the fact that he didn&#8217;t want to have sex with anyone else, I pushed the issue a bit.&nbsp; 

�Don&#8217;t you want your reward pet?&nbsp; Denise is a lovely, little sub.�&nbsp; 

�Yes she is Mistress, but I don&#8217;t want to have sex with her.�&nbsp; 

�Ah, but you wouldn&#8217;t be having sex with her pet.�&nbsp; 

When he looked at me in confusion, I told him. �I would be having sex with her, using you.&nbsp; I will be there the whole time pet.&nbsp; I just thought it would be a nice release for you, seeing as how you haven&#8217;t had sex in quite a while, and I&#8217;ve forbidden you to masturbate.&nbsp; You haven&#8217;t been doing that behind my back, have you pet?�&nbsp; 

I knew perfectly well he hadn&#8217;t, I also knew that I had been making him extremely aroused with some of the things I asked of him.&nbsp; I would occasionally grant him release with a hand job, but that wasn&#8217;t very often.&nbsp; 

�No Mistress, of course not.� He hastened to assure me.&nbsp; 

�Well it&#8217;s up to you pet.&nbsp; I will not force you.�&nbsp; 

�You would be there Mistress?�&nbsp; 

�Not only will I be there, I will be directing your actions.�&nbsp; 

I could see his mind quickly come to the realization that, not only would I be using him to have sex with her, he would be using her to have sex with me.&nbsp; He agreed and I had Denise come over the next day.&nbsp; 

Paul had moved into my apartment the year before, sharing a room with Brian, who was usually off with his girlfriend anyway.&nbsp; It had worked out well. I could keep a close eye on my pet and he got out of the dorms.&nbsp; 

Chapter 10
When Denise showed up, I let her in, as Paul was attached to my chair by a leash.&nbsp; He was kneeling; knees spread wide, head down, palms on his thighs, wearing nothing but his collar and a pair of shorts.&nbsp; I had been mercilessly teasing him for an hour and making him worship my pussy with his mouth and tongue. His erection was quite visible and I knew he was uncomfortable.&nbsp; I had done this purposely because I wanted him to think of the physical release that was coming more than the fact that he would be having intercourse with someone else.&nbsp; 

As soon as I shut the door, Denise knelt, glancing at Paul and then looking at me to see what I wanted.&nbsp; Matt had trained his subs well, but he liked more ostentatious displays of submissiveness than I did and he did not tolerate any hesitations or disagreements from his subs, so he tended to select more naturally submissive personalities than I did.&nbsp; 

I wanted to be sure Denise was really willing to do this and not simply accepting that Matt told her to do it.&nbsp; I took her to my office in the back and told her she had permission to speak freely.&nbsp; 

�Denise are you okay with doing this? I won&#8217;t make you if you don&#8217;t want to, and I won&#8217;t tell your Master that you didn&#8217;t.�&nbsp; 

�Thank you Miss A for being so kind, but I do want to.&nbsp; I&#8217;ve wanted to see if he&#8217;s as good as he looks since I met him.� She said with a smile as a flare of possessiveness went through me.&nbsp; 

�Master makes us do all sorts of things, but he wouldn&#8217;t do something like this unless he knew Joe and I were okay with it.�&nbsp; 

�Very well.&nbsp; You do know I will be there as well don&#8217;t you?� 

�Oh Miss A, I truly hope so.�&nbsp; 

That surprised me.&nbsp; I hadn&#8217;t known Denise was bi, or that she even thought of me that way.&nbsp; I had nothing against using a female sub, a tongue was a tongue after all, but I generally preferred men.&nbsp; 

�Good, well go ahead and strip to your bra and panties and then join us in the living room.&nbsp; If you need to use the restroom, I suggest you do it now, you won&#8217;t have the opportunity for quite a while.�&nbsp; 

�Yes Miss A.� she said, eyes downcast.&nbsp; 

I left her in the office and went back to the living room.&nbsp; Paul hadn&#8217;t moved although his erection had subsided a bit.&nbsp; I sat down in the chair and stroked his head.&nbsp; I was having second thoughts.&nbsp; I didn&#8217;t really want to share my pet in any manner, but until I was sure I could fully commit to my feelings for him, it wasn&#8217;t fair to deny him an integral part of his sexuality and I knew he was unlikely to do it on his own now that he lived in my apartment.&nbsp; Plus I wanted to make sure I was secure enough in my own right to be comfortable knowing that physical acts didn&#8217;t affect my love for him.&nbsp; 

Chapter 11
Before I could change my mind, Denise entered the room and knelt on the other side of my chair.&nbsp; She was clad in a lacy bra and thong that did little to conceal her beautiful breasts and waxed pussy.&nbsp; Just because I preferred men didn&#8217;t keep me from appreciating women&#8217;s bodies and Denise was truly spectacular.&nbsp; 

I felt Paul tense under my hand as I gazed on Denise.&nbsp; Curious, I glanced at him.&nbsp; His fingers were digging into his thighs and his back was tight.&nbsp; The muscles in his jaw clenched as he ground his teeth.&nbsp; He was angry, but I wasn&#8217;t sure why.&nbsp; 

I turned back to Denise, watching Paul out of the corner of my eye. This was interesting and I wanted to find out what it was about before we continued.&nbsp; I could have just asked him, but I didn&#8217;t want to put him on the spot in front of an outsider.&nbsp; I stroked Denise&#8217;s face gently, watching her nipples get hard as she leaned into my hand.&nbsp; I still had a hand on my pet and could feel him tense further.&nbsp; 

Was it possible he was jealous I wondered?&nbsp; That wouldn&#8217;t do.&nbsp; A bit of possessiveness was fine, but jealousy pointed to either a lack of trust or insecurity.&nbsp; Neither was an acceptable trait in any relationship as far as I was concerned, hence my testing of myself.&nbsp; If I could do it, he damn well could too.&nbsp; 

I continued to run my hand over Denise, gradually working my way towards her breasts, while I thought of how to handle it.&nbsp; I slid my hand inside Denise&#8217;s bra and fondled her breast, rolling the hard nipple between my fingers, pinching and tugging lightly.&nbsp; Denise&#8217;s breath caught in her throat and when I moved to the other breast, she let out a low moan.&nbsp; Paul was digging his fingers into his thighs so hard I was worried he was going to draw blood.&nbsp; Definitely jealous.&nbsp; 

I quickly made up my mind which tact to take and, pretending I hadn&#8217;t noticed, I grabbed his hair, tilted his head back and kissed him until he was breathless.&nbsp; Looking into his eyes, I could see his emotions as clearly as if they were laid out on a table.&nbsp; Jealousy that I was touching someone else, anger that I found someone else attractive, fear that I might desire them more than him and desperation to not let me know that any of this was going through his head.&nbsp; 

I kissed him again, softer this time, trying to let him feel how much I cared for him.&nbsp; When I looked in his eyes again, they were much calmer and a lot of the tension had gone out of him.&nbsp; That was as far as I was willing to go to help him.&nbsp; He would have to work out the rest on his own.&nbsp; 

I turned my attention back to Denise, who was breathing heavily from watching me kiss my pet.&nbsp; I removed my hand from her breast, after giving it a final squeeze, and pulling her by the hair guided her to the front of my chair, doing the same with Paul until they were kneeling in front of me facing each other.&nbsp; 

I unclipped the leash holding Paul to the chair and, turning their heads towards me, said �You will only do what I tell you to do.&nbsp; Is that understood?�&nbsp; 

�Yes Mistress� they both said.&nbsp; 

�You will touch each other with just your hands and just from the waist up.&nbsp; Gently and sensually, I don&#8217;t want any roughness yet.�&nbsp; 

I released both their heads and sat back in my chair, already aroused by the sight of both of them and knowing they were ultimately here to serve me.&nbsp; Paul hesitantly reached out to touch Denise, sliding his hand down her arm, glancing at me to see if I was watching.&nbsp; Denise evidenced no such hesitation, eagerly reaching out to run her hands over his chest.&nbsp; 

Paul slowly grew more comfortable, so I started giving him commands, so that he would remember who was really in charge.&nbsp; 

�Remover her bra pet.&nbsp; Slowly.&nbsp; Unveil her slowly.�&nbsp; 

As he followed my directions, Denise&#8217;s body started to flush as she got more aroused.&nbsp; 

�Now run your thumbs over her nipples.&nbsp; That&#8217;s it.&nbsp; Denise, do the same to him.�&nbsp; 

I could see that Paul&#8217;s erection was starting to return, his nipples were surprisingly sensitive for as small as they were.&nbsp; Denise&#8217;s were engorged and hard as bullets.&nbsp; Time to step it up.&nbsp; 

�Palms on your thighs Denise, spread your knees wider. Paul pinch her nipples. Harder. Don&#8217;t worry, she likes a little spice.&nbsp; Don&#8217;t you little sub?�&nbsp; 

�Yes Mistress� Denise moaned.&nbsp; 

I put a hand on each of their backs.&nbsp; �Tilt your head back Denise.&nbsp; Paul, keep playing with her breasts and lick and nibble her neck.� 

Paul leaned forward to place his mouth on her neck, while squeezing her breasts and then running his fingers gently over them before pulling her nipples taut.&nbsp; Denise&#8217;s eyes were closed and she was breathing heavily.&nbsp; I resisted touching myself, but I could feel my panties getting wet at the hot scene in front of me.&nbsp; 

Matt had told me she orgasmed very easily, and could do so without any genital stimulation, so I was watching her very closely.&nbsp; I didn&#8217;t want her to cum yet. 

�Stop pet.�&nbsp; 

Immediately he sat back on his heels, putting his hands on his thighs.&nbsp; Denise whimpered a little at the sudden lack of sensation.&nbsp; I grabbed her chin roughly, knowing she was a masochist. 

�Quiet. I hate whiners.� I said turning her to face me.&nbsp; 

When she was looking at me, I grabbed her nipple, twisting it firmly, while saying �Reciprocate. Exactly.� 

Watching her eyes glaze over, I waited until she was shaking and biting her lip before I released her and sat back in my chair once more.&nbsp; I ran my fingers through Paul&#8217;s hair and across his lips while Denise licked his neck and played with his nipples as well as she was able.&nbsp; The muscles in his chest were so firm, it was hard to get his nipples, but she did her best and it was evident that he was enjoying it by the way his erection grew.&nbsp; 

�Stop now Denise.� 

She ignored me, as we had agreed to, as part of our conversation.&nbsp; I wanted to see if Paul could top other women or if he was submissive to all women.&nbsp; I grabbed Denise by her hair, pulling her off Paul, and holding her bent painfully backwards while I spoke menacingly in her ear.&nbsp; 

�I said to stop little slut, you will obey or you will be punished.�&nbsp; 

�Yes Mistress. I&#8217;m sorry.� She whimpered, tears coming to her eyes because of the pain.&nbsp; 

Even knowing she liked pain and was probably getting wetter the more I hurt her, I almost let up.&nbsp; I wasn&#8217;t used to causing real pain for pleasure, only for punishment, but when I had asked Denise what she would like out of this encounter, she had said a hard spanking.&nbsp; So we had set this up so that she could get one and I could see how Paul would react.
&nbsp; 
Chapter 12
I looked to Paul and he was glaring at her.&nbsp; He had been punished for screwing up, but he had never deliberately disobeyed me.&nbsp; 

�What should we do with the disobedient, little whore, pet?� I asked him.&nbsp; 

�She should be punished Mistress.�&nbsp; 

�I believe you are right pet.&nbsp; How should we punish her?&nbsp; Keep in mind that she doesn&#8217;t know all the rules here and it is her first infraction.�&nbsp; 

�Stop means stop under everyone&#8217;s rules Mistress.�&nbsp; 

�True� I mused. �Bring me that bag pet.� I said pointing to a large gym bag by the sofa.&nbsp; 

He started to get up.&nbsp; �No pet, stay on your knees, I like to watch your ass wiggle as you crawl.� 

�Yes Mistress� he said, crawling to the sofa, putting the handles of the bag in his mouth and crawling back to set the bag at my feet.&nbsp; 

�Good boy, now find the large nipple clamps and put them on her.�

He dug around in the bag until he found the clamps, then he paused.&nbsp; 

�I&#8217;m sorry Mistress, I don&#8217;t know what to do.�&nbsp; 

�Pull on the nipple, stretch it toward you and then place the clamp at the base.&nbsp; No need to be gentle, it is punishment after all.&nbsp; Isn&#8217;t it little slut?�&nbsp; 

Denise was crying in earnest now, but I could also see her eyes starting to glaze over as she headed to subspace.&nbsp; 

�Yes Mistress� she sobbed.&nbsp; 

She winced when Paul applied the second clamp.&nbsp; I pushed her head down to my feet.&nbsp; 

�Now pet, you will spank her, hard.&nbsp; 20 to each check and you will do it well, or I will spank you.�&nbsp; 

�Yes Mistress.� He looked absolutely eager. 

�And you will not utter a sound; you will keep your head on my feet and your hands on the floor. Do you understand little slut? We don&#8217;t tolerate disobedience in this household.� 

�Yes Mistress� she cried.&nbsp; 

�You may begin pet.�&nbsp; 

I watched him closely as he spanked her.&nbsp; I wanted to see if he really enjoyed being in the position of power over Denise, or if he was simply doing what I told him.&nbsp; His face set in concentration, he started spanking her.&nbsp; No warm up, he just spanked her hard enough to leave a red imprint of his hand on her ass.&nbsp; He struck a different part every time, sometimes overlapping a previous spot.&nbsp; He looked very business-like, but each time his hand met her ass, and the sharp slap sounded through the room, his erection grew, until it was straining the front of his shorts.&nbsp; 

I could feel Denise&#8217;s tears on my feet, but I could also feel her licking and kissing my feet around the straps of my sandals.&nbsp; When Paul got to the last one, he waited a bit and let the tension rise, and then he spanked her so hard that I felt her head move.&nbsp; A fresh stream of tears wet my feet, but she didn&#8217;t make a sound.&nbsp; 

Paul knelt back on his heels again, breathing heavily, his shorts damp where pre-cum had soaked them, and his eyes glittering with lust as he looked down at her.&nbsp; I leaned forward to kiss him passionately, as lust filled as he was.&nbsp; 

I stroked his erection through his shorts, saying �You did very well my pet.&nbsp; Did you enjoy it?�&nbsp; 

�Yes Mistress, I did.&nbsp; Very much.&nbsp; Thank you for giving me the opportunity to do that.�&nbsp; 

Good, he enjoyed the power he had over another sub, but he showed no signs of wanting to change our dynamic.&nbsp; Denise hadn&#8217;t moved, her body shaking with silent sobs.&nbsp; 

Chapter 13
I pulled her up by her hair, looking into her eyes.&nbsp; Tears ran down her face, smearing her mascara, but her eyes were soft and unfocused.&nbsp; I slid my hand under her thong to find her soaked, and when I slid my finger inside her, her pussy clamped down on it and she started moving her hips.&nbsp; I fucked her with my finger for a minute, watching her get more and more aroused.&nbsp; 

When I pulled my finger out, she moaned but made no other sound.&nbsp; I placed my finger on her lips and she started licking it clean without any encouragement, sucking my finger into her mouth and working on it vigorously.&nbsp; Oh yes, she definitely enjoyed the spanking.&nbsp; I fucked her with my other hand while she sucked on my finger, getting her to a fever pitch before pulling my fingers out and sticking them in Paul&#8217;s mouth.&nbsp; He cleaned them thoroughly and when he was done, I told them both to strip. 

When they were completely naked and kneeling at my feet once more, I parted my split skirt so that my pussy was in view.&nbsp; Pulling Denise closer by the nipple clamps, I yanked them off, pleased to hear her let out a scream, I rubbed them softly with my hands and said.&nbsp; 

�On your hands and knees little slut with your face in my lap.&nbsp; You will pleasure me while he fucks you.&nbsp; You will do a good job, or I will punish you some more and I can guarantee you will not enjoy it.&nbsp; Neither of you will cum until I say you can.&nbsp; Pet, put a condom on and fuck my little slut.&nbsp; Make her scream against my pussy pet.�&nbsp; 

Denise rapidly positioned herself as I had told her, kissing around my pussy while Paul slid a condom over his swollen cock.&nbsp; I could feel Denise&#8217;s tongue on my clit and it was all I could do to not moan out loud. 

�Start slow pet, make her beg for you.�&nbsp; 

He placed the head of his cock at the dripping entrance of her cunt and slowly pushed in, just a little, before slowly pulling back out.&nbsp; Repeating the motion over and over, he soon had Denise moaning and whining against my pussy, but her tongue never stopped.&nbsp; She licked my clit, she slid her tongue inside me and swirled it around, she sucked my lips into her mouth, nibbling gently on them.&nbsp; The girl was a pussy eating genius, she should teach classes.&nbsp; My orgasm started to rise.&nbsp; 

�Look at me pet.�&nbsp; 

He locked his eyes on me.&nbsp; 

�Keep looking at me and make the little slut scream.�&nbsp; 

Eyes holding mine, he slammed his cock deep inside her, fucking her hard and fast.&nbsp; He held her hips still, his hands digging into her inflamed cheeks, but I could still feel every stroke.&nbsp; It was like his cock was attached to her tongue, which she had buried inside me and kept curling it up against my G-spot.&nbsp; 

He fucked me with her tongue, while I fucked him with her pussy.&nbsp; She was moaning continuously now, the sound vibrating against my clit.&nbsp; I held her head tightly to me, but I never took my eyes off my pet.&nbsp; 

When he started to lose control, I ground my cunt against Denise&#8217;s face, sending the orgasm racing through my body and flooding her mouth with my juices which she greedily lapped up.&nbsp; 

�Keep looking at me pet.&nbsp; You keep your head right where it is girl.&nbsp; You may both cum now.� 

Denise immediately let go an earth-shattering scream as her climax shook her body.&nbsp; Paul reached around with one hand and rubbed her clit while fucking her even harder, keeping his eyes on mine.&nbsp; I dipped my fingers in my cunt, coating them liberally, and then shoved them in his mouth, so that he would be tasting me when he came.&nbsp; 

Denise came again, crying out against my pussy, and Paul finally released his orgasm, burying his cock to the hilt inside her, his body shuddering and shaking, while he sucked my fingers and never dropped his eyes.&nbsp; He collapsed against Denise&#8217;s back and I stroked both their heads while talking to them soothingly.&nbsp; 

I gave them a few minutes to gather their composure and then pushed them off.&nbsp; 

�Paul go shower.� 

�Yes Mistress.�&nbsp; 

Denise sat back on her heels, her eyes slowly coming back into focus while I held her hand and stroked her hair.&nbsp; 

�Are you okay Denise?�&nbsp; 

�Yes Mistress, that was wonderful.�&nbsp; 

�Thank you for your help. I will tell your Master how pleasing you were.&nbsp; You may use my bathroom to wash up. Is there anything you need?�&nbsp; 

�Mistress, would you�, would you please kiss me?�&nbsp; 

I looked at her for a few minutes and then held her face in my hands and kissed her softly, deepening the kiss as I felt her whole body soften.&nbsp; 

�Thank you Mistress� she whispered when I stopped.&nbsp; 

Then she got up to go take a shower and get dressed.&nbsp; Paul came back out with a towel wrapped around his waist and knelt back at my feet.&nbsp; 

He laid his head in my lap and said �Thank you Mistress�, while I ran my fingers through his damp hair.&nbsp; 

We stayed like that until Denise came out.&nbsp; 

�Mistress, may I thank Denise?� 

�Of course you may pet.� 

He rose and went to Denise and hugged her.&nbsp; 

�Thank you Denise. That was quite an experience.�&nbsp; 

�You&#8217;re welcome. Any time.� She said.&nbsp; 

Kissing her on the cheek, he opened the door for her.&nbsp; She waved goodbye and headed back to her Master.&nbsp; I called Matt and told him how pleased I was with his sub, thanking him for the loan.&nbsp; Then I led Paul back to my bedroom and, after having him wash me, let him lay next to me on the bed, with his head on my stomach until we both fell asleep.&nbsp; 

Chapter 14
After that we took great leaps forward in our relationship.&nbsp; The draft came and he was picked in the first round.&nbsp; Brian and I took him out to celebrate. The team that had picked him was in the city where I had lived before, so it would be easy to continue things.&nbsp; A niggling worry had inserted itself in my mind that, now that he was going pro, he wouldn&#8217;t want to continue, but I didn&#8217;t let that show during our celebration because I was genuinely happy for him.&nbsp; 

Graduation neared and Brian got hired by the company he had spent the last two summers interning for.&nbsp; He made plans to move in with his girlfriend.&nbsp; One afternoon, just before graduation, Paul came looking for me in my workshop.&nbsp; 

�Mistress� he said, when I noticed him standing there. 

�Yes pet?� 

�Can we talk? Person to person?� 

Here it comes, I thought, he&#8217;s going to ask to be released.&nbsp; 

�Of course, Paul. What&#8217;s on your mind?� 

�Amy, I&#8217;m going to be moving to the city after graduation, and I was wondering.� He paused for a moment while my heart dropped into my stomach. �I was wondering if you would come with me.�&nbsp; 

I fought back tears of joy and just nodded my head.&nbsp; He swept me into a big hug, lifting me of my feet.&nbsp; 

�This doesn&#8217;t mean anything will change.� I said gruffly.&nbsp; 

�Of course not Mistress.� He said, grinning from ear to ear.&nbsp; 

Chapter 15
The next few months flew by, what with moving, football camp and then football season.&nbsp; Paul worked harder than ever, earning the starting position over the number 2 quarterback when the starter got hurt.&nbsp; Before every game he would work himself into a nervous state and beg for a session.&nbsp; On away games he would call me and I would talk him through his nerves.&nbsp; 

Once he became quarterback, they didn&#8217;t lose a game.&nbsp; Unknown to him, I saw every one.&nbsp; Flying to away games and sitting where he couldn&#8217;t see me.&nbsp; He always asked me to come to the games and I always declined, saying I couldn&#8217;t abide football.&nbsp; The truth was I was afraid I would distract him, but I loved watching him play.&nbsp; 

On the eve of the Super Bowl, I secretly flew to watch the game.&nbsp; I knew his nerves would be eating him alive.&nbsp; He had never gotten cocky, or arrogant, like most pro athletes.&nbsp; His insecurities about his abilities were as endearing as they were unfathomable.&nbsp; 

With the help of the coach, who, unbeknownst to Paul, was the husband and sub, of my friend Nikki, I booked a room just down the hall.&nbsp; I kept my door cracked and waited.&nbsp; I had been fairly harsh with him before he had left, because I didn&#8217;t want him to figure out I had a surprise for him.&nbsp; 

I was going to claim him completely, and I was going to do it in such a way that he wouldn&#8217;t even know it had been done until it was over.&nbsp; Of course some of it would depend on his reaction to certain scenarios I had set up.&nbsp; Nikki had agreed to help and she was in the room with me, fine-tuning our plans.&nbsp; The coach was okay with it, because he knew how well Paul played after a session with me.&nbsp; 

I had waited almost three long years for this night.&nbsp; Denying myself the full pleasure of Paul&#8217;s body.&nbsp; At first afraid it would interfere with our Domme/sub relationship, then simply being afraid of being more in love with him than I already was.&nbsp; 

I deserved an Oscar for all the times I affected nonchalance or indifference to his interactions with other women, most of which I organized, when the whole time it tore me apart inside.&nbsp; I hated sharing what was mine, but I also wanted to be sure it was fully mine before I finally let go of the last vestige of control.&nbsp; 

I was pretty sure now, but there was one last test.&nbsp; This was to be my finest performance, and my big gamble.&nbsp; I guess I stacked the deck a bit, but would anyone blame me when they saw the stakes I was playing for?&nbsp; 

Chapter 16
Nikki and I waited until we heard Paul&#8217;s door open.&nbsp; I peaked through the crack, my cell phone in hand, knowing he had spent the last couple hours working himself into a nervous wreck.&nbsp; Sure enough, he was racing out the door on his way to find something to help him relax.&nbsp; 

I pushed the last number on the phone in his room, watching him spin around and frantically search for his room key.&nbsp; Nikki and I giggled behind our hands as he finally got his door open and dashed back in to answer the phone.&nbsp; I quickly composed myself as he picked up. I could hear him panting from running across the room and his fear that he had missed my call.&nbsp; 

�Hello? Hello?�&nbsp; 

�What have you been doing pet? You haven&#8217;t been tiring yourself out before your big game have you?�&nbsp; 

Nikki was listening in, her head close to the phone, biting her hand to keep from laughing out loud.&nbsp; We talked for a little bit, until his nerves, as I knew they would, put him in a hole, he couldn&#8217;t scramble out of.&nbsp; I feigned displeasure and when he started trying to apologize, I stopped him. 

�Quiet. When you hang up you will strip and put your collar on.&nbsp; Then you will kneel on the floor with your back to the door for 30 minutes.&nbsp; Is that clear?�&nbsp; 

Damn it. I was trying so hard not to laugh, that I had forgotten to tell him to open the door.&nbsp; I hoped it would be obvious enough, or that he was nervous enough, that he would think that was what I wanted.&nbsp; His next words made me sigh in relief.&nbsp; 

�But Mistress, people will be walking down the hallway.�&nbsp; 

I knew he didn&#8217;t like to be on display, even when it was just other people involved in BDSM, here it was even worse, and there were vanilla people around, not to mention his teammates.&nbsp; I was going to make sure no one but Nikki saw him, but he didn&#8217;t know that.&nbsp; 

I asked him if he was refusing, hoping his trust and training were strong enough to pass this test.&nbsp; He didn&#8217;t refuse, and he tried to make it seem like he wasn&#8217;t questioning me.&nbsp; He really was very sweet.&nbsp; I gave him task and hung up.&nbsp; 

Nikki and I howled like hyenas.&nbsp; When we finally stopped laughing, I peeked out the door to see if he had started yet.&nbsp; I knew he was probably debating about whether to do it or not.&nbsp; I wasn&#8217;t worried on that score.&nbsp; Paul was extremely honest, he would do it.&nbsp; 

I peeked through the crack again to see him open his door and check both ways down the hall before ducking back inside.&nbsp; I started the stopwatch, wanting to give him plenty of time getting �punished� before I sent Nikki in there.&nbsp; I gave him a few minutes to get settled and then snuck down the hallway to keep an eye on him and block his doorway from view.&nbsp; I was lucky nobody walked by, but the coach had asked the hotel to seal off this hallway, so his star quarterback wouldn&#8217;t be disturbed.&nbsp; 

I watched him tense and start every time the floor creaked or a noise came from somewhere else in the hotel.&nbsp; Eventually I saw him completely relax and I wondered what he was thinking about.&nbsp; With about 5 minutes left, Nikki came out of our room and walked into his.&nbsp; 

Chapter 17
I watched for a moment to see if he would turn around, or get up, when he realized he wasn&#8217;t alone anymore.&nbsp; He tensed but didn&#8217;t move when Nikki spoke.&nbsp; I ran back to the room and closed the door waiting for her call.&nbsp; My cell rang.&nbsp; 

�Hello, is this Mistress A? I seem to have found your puppy.�&nbsp; 

�Ask him how long he has left Nikki.�&nbsp; 

I could hear her say something to him but I couldn&#8217;t hear his response.&nbsp; Nikki came back on the phone.&nbsp; 

�He says he has two minutes left.�&nbsp; 

�How&#8217;s his posture? Did he move?� 

�He looks nice. Kneeling nice and straight. No, he didn&#8217;t move.�&nbsp; 

�Let me talk to him.�&nbsp; 

�Okay, just a moment.� 

I heard her say something to him, and then �Yes Mistress?�&nbsp; 

He sounded so upset; I just wanted to cuddle him. 

�I&#8217;m very proud of you pet. I knew you would do well.� 

�Thank you Mistress.�&nbsp; 

I told him that the lady had agreed to reward him, but that it was up to him. He asked me what I wanted him to do.&nbsp; I told him to do what he felt he had to do to be ready for his game tomorrow. We said good night and when Nikki got back on the phone, I said. 

�Give him the two options Nikki.�&nbsp; 

She hung up and a few minutes later walked back in the room.&nbsp; 

�Well, how did it go?� I demanded. 

�I don&#8217;t know how you do it Amy.&nbsp; I wouldn&#8217;t let that luscious man out of my sight.&nbsp; He turned me down.&nbsp; Didn&#8217;t even think about it.&nbsp; He&#8217;s so in loooovvvee with you, and so devoted to his Mistress it&#8217;s not even funny.&nbsp; I know you&#8217;ve let him have sex with other women, but I bet you he doesn&#8217;t do it that often and it&#8217;s more of a masturbation technique than anything.&nbsp; I&#8217;m sure if you gave him that snatch of yours even once, he wouldn&#8217;t even do that.&nbsp; I did kiss him though.&nbsp; I hope you don&#8217;t mind.&nbsp; I figured I deserved something for pulling that off without laughing.�&nbsp; 

I laughed. �He&#8217;s got nice lips, doesn&#8217;t he?�&nbsp; 

�He&#8217;s got nice everything.&nbsp; You sure I can&#8217;t borrow him sometime?�&nbsp; 

�Sorry Nikki, but after tonight, nobody is ever touching him again.�&nbsp; 

�Well have fun hun.&nbsp; I&#8217;m off to see if Coach is up for some playtime.&nbsp; Your puppy has gotten me all hot and bothered.�&nbsp; 

I gave her a hug and then waited until I was sure Paul would be done with his shower.&nbsp; 

Chapter 18
I called his room and when he answered, said. 

�Pet, I have decided that you deserve a little surprise for your good behavior.&nbsp; Unlock your door and lay down on your bed.&nbsp; Close your eyes. No peeking.�&nbsp; 

I hung up quickly.&nbsp; Giving myself the once over, spraying a new perfume to cover my familiar scent, I hoped that his thinking I was 1000 miles away, combined with everything else that had happened, would convince him that I was the woman who had caught him in his room.&nbsp; I had been practicing a new voice, but I didn&#8217;t think it was good enough to fool him.&nbsp; 

Going down the hall in nothing but a towel, I quietly entered his room to find him half asleep.&nbsp; He started awake and I thought he was going to ruin it all by opening his eyes, but he managed to keep them shut.&nbsp; I tried my new voice out on him and it seemed to be working.&nbsp; I blindfolded him and told him to restrain himself.&nbsp; Then I did what I had been longing to do for almost three years.&nbsp; 

I made love to him with my lips and hands, not to amuse myself by tormenting him, or as a reward, but just to give him the pleasure he had given me.&nbsp; It was a sensual delight.&nbsp; I played with his sensitive nipples, chuckling in pleasure when his cock started to grow. I pulled out every teasing trick I knew, combining it with my intimate knowledge of him and his body.&nbsp; 

I knelt between his legs and then leaned over him to lick, nip and suck his nipples, getting wet at the sound of his moans and the sight of his beautiful cock standing out from his body.&nbsp; When I licked and kissed his neck I could tell he was going mad.&nbsp; When I moved back down his body and nipped his belly while dragging my nails down his sides he actually raised off the bed, sliding his cock between my breasts.&nbsp; He was so hot that if felt like he was burning me where his cock touched.&nbsp; 

I knelt down between his legs and started blowing on his balls, knowing how much he liked it.&nbsp; He was groaning loudly now, while I teased him.&nbsp; I chuckled again.&nbsp; 

�You&#8217;ll have to beg for what you want.� 

His cock twitched. For some reason having to beg for what he wanted turned him on.&nbsp; 

�Please touch my cock.� He said.&nbsp; 

I couldn&#8217;t believe he was so far gone as to be that unspecific.&nbsp; I helped him out a little.&nbsp; 

�Please stroke it with your fingers, while you lick and suck my balls.� He continued after he realized what he had done.&nbsp; 

I gave him two options and asked which he preferred. 

When he said �Both�, with no please, I stopped touching him.&nbsp; 

I knew it was my fault that he could barely talk, but I wasn&#8217;t going to let a lack of manners slide.&nbsp; It only took him a moment to figure it out and apologize.&nbsp; 

�Both please.� He said.&nbsp; 

Chapter 19
I continued. I was trying to give him the best blow job of his life.&nbsp; I was out of practice, but it didn&#8217;t seem to matter to him.&nbsp; He begged me to suck his cock.&nbsp; I started to slowly deep throat him, pleased that my practicing on the lollipops had paid off and I could do it without gagging.&nbsp; He wasn&#8217;t the largest guy in the world, but he wasn&#8217;t small.&nbsp; 

When I lightly touched his anus, his hips moved violently. I knew what he wanted, but I was still trying to drive him insane with teasing. 

�Stop?� I questioned.&nbsp; 

�No, no, please don&#8217;t.� he whimpered. 

�Okay, but you have to hold still.�&nbsp; 

I moved until I was kneeling over his body to make it easier for me to reach everything.&nbsp; I kept my pussy as high as I could, knowing that if I pressed it to his face, he would know it was me instantly, I also wasn&#8217;t sure if I had enough control to deal with any extra sensation. When I started rubbing his prostate, I could feel the cum pulsing in his shaft against my tongue.&nbsp; 

I heard him start begging again.&nbsp; I couldn&#8217;t believe my good luck when he said �Can I� instead of �May I�, when he asked permission to cum.&nbsp; I laughed at him and asked him if he was able.&nbsp; I kept moving my fingers, milking his prostate.&nbsp; I knew how much control he had left and I was doing a delicate balancing act, keeping him at a fever pitch, without sending him over the edge.&nbsp; He figured it out, even though it couldn&#8217;t have been easy with me playing with his body.&nbsp; 

�May I please cum?� he gasped.&nbsp; 

�No you may not.&nbsp; Not yet.� 

�Please stop or I won&#8217;t be able to hold back.� He begged.&nbsp; 

�Oh, I think you will. Just think how disappointed your Mistress will be.�&nbsp; 

That was a dirty trick pulling the Mistress card, but it worked.&nbsp; I teased him for a little longer, then, just before he was going to cum anyway, I let go.&nbsp; Giving him just enough of a break to allow him to regain some slight control, I repositioned myself, and slowly slid down his cock, clenching the muscles in my cunt around his shaft.&nbsp; Thank goodness for Kegel exercises.&nbsp; 

I almost came right then from the long awaited feel of his cock filling my pussy.&nbsp; I whispered to him, no longer caring if he knew it was me or not. 

�Wait until I cum pet, then you may cum also.�&nbsp; 

He groaned loudly as I slowly fucked him.&nbsp; It wouldn&#8217;t take me long as aroused as I was, but I wanted to feel his mouth on me, so, fighting for control, I brushed my breasts over his lips and said. 

�Suck my breasts pet.�&nbsp; 

Oh it felt so good, I almost lost it.&nbsp; My pussy gyrated on his cock, faster and faster, of its own accord.&nbsp; He tensed all his muscles and held himself still to keep from cumming.&nbsp; 

I couldn&#8217;t hold off anymore, I managed to whisper �Cum for me pet,� before my orgasm took over.&nbsp; 

With a shout he exploded, filling my pussy with hot cum.&nbsp; He came so hard he passed out for a moment, giving me just enough time to clamber off the bed, grab a hotel robe and sit on the sofa.&nbsp; 

Chapter 20
I saw him reach up and pull of the blindfold, blinking a little but not looking around.&nbsp; His eyes closed again and he started drifting off.&nbsp; 

I spoke softly �Are you ready for your game now pet?� 

Without opening his eyes, he said �Yes Mistress. Thank you.�&nbsp; 

�Good. When you get home remind me to punish you for your lapses in manners and grammar.�&nbsp; 

His eyes flew open and he turned his head, finally realizing I was actually there.&nbsp; He looked a little silly with his mouth hanging open, but all I did was remind him that he owed me a greeting.&nbsp; I let him greet me for a few minutes, reestablishing our basic roles, no matter what had just occurred, and then I made him get back in bed.&nbsp; I soothed him to sleep and then just lay there and held him for a long time, thinking how blessed I was to have the love of my life also be the sub of my life.&nbsp; 

The next day I sat where he could see me and watched him play the most spectacular game of his life.&nbsp; I watched the post game interview, smiling when he told the interviewer he was going to the dungeon.&nbsp; 

When he got home, I did punish him quite severely before I fucked his brains out.&nbsp; I also told him to move into my room in the apartment, that he was no longer free to have sex with anybody else, ever, and that we were now going to be 24/7.&nbsp; 

He just smiled smugly and said. �Yes Mistress.�
