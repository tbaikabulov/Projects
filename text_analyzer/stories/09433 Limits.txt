Caveat

As ever with the Literotica categories I end up falling between two stools. Is this a D/s love story where the main characters just happen to be lesbian or is it a lesbian love story where the characters relationship just happens to be D/s? Well, it's a bit of both. If you don't like stories where one woman calls another 'Mistress' then this tale is not for you. Furthermore, I've concentrated on the 'Lit' in Literotica. Don't expect hot girl-on-girl action right from the start, although you will find plenty of action along the way. 

Dedication

It is hard to express the full depth of my gratitude to the two persons who have done so much to help this story come alive. Both have put in many hours of unsung effort with no thought of any reward beyond my heartfelt thanks. In no particular order there's
Estragon: Ruthless eliminator of the run on sentence, fearless destroyer of clich�s. No homonym escapes his eagle eye.&nbsp; I always used to wonder why authors thanked their editors so profusely; now I know. Without him this would surely be a sorry mess of grammatical errors.
OneWhoAdores: Right from the start he saw, clearer than I, the direction this story would take. Long discussions about morality within the D/s relationship and the lines we draw between fantasy and reality formed the background to this story and, in many ways, this is a co-write.
Both are authors on this site, authors whose work I admire. I urge you to check them out.

On with the story....

Karen Morris sat in the privacy of the restroom stall, hiding away and shaking slightly. It was another bad day at work; they all seemed to be bad nowadays. Ever since she had been promoted to team leader by dint of her long service, she was well out of her depth and she knew it. She had just finished a session with her supervisor, who had been on her back about falling productivity and, when she had returned to try to chivvy up the telesales girls she was nominally in charge of, they had all but laughed in her face. One thing was for certain, they had no respect for her either as a leader or as a person. With each month's declining figures she was moving closer and closer to being sacked. Why had she accepted the promotion in the first place? But then she never could say no, not then, not ever. She clamped her hands between her knees and fought back the tears that welled in her eyes.

She was still sitting like that when she heard the door to the restroom open and a group of women from her team came in followed shortly by the reek of cigarette smoke.

"Good grief, that Karen, what a waste of space! Trying to give us a hard time about smoking breaks, as if we care a jot what she says or thinks. Poncy little madam, isn't she," one of the women exclaimed. Evidently they were unaware that she was sitting in the end stall. Perhaps they didn't even care.

"Yeah, smarmy little prig. She's so uptight it's not true; I reckon what she needs is a damn good shag but she can't get a man so she takes it out on us," another joined in.

"Karen Morris, shagging! Don't make me laugh; OK, so she could look quite decent if she took a little trouble over herself but look at the clothes she wears and that hair style. Even if she did sort herself out no man would ever get anywhere near her, those knickers of hers are made of cast iron and her legs were welded shut years ago."

This caused a general round of laughter. 

"But seriously, do you think she's ever done it?"

"What, her! Never!" one of the women snorted in derision. "Her pussy's seen so little action it's healed over. And if anyone did get up there all they would find is cobwebs. Nah, if ever there was a middle-aged virgin it's that one."

"Middle-aged? I didn't think she was more than thirty, if that," another queried.

"Thirty going on fifty," was the retort. "She's been middle aged ever since she was a teenager, that one. You can just bet she lives alone and keeps cats."

This produced more gales of laughter. 

As she listened in horror, Karen shamefully admitted to herself that the women were right. Although she didn't have a cat she was a virgin and with the way she was going she was showing every likelihood of remaining one. Sex had never been a feature in her life; indeed, the only time a male of any description had been anywhere near her was a clumsy grope back in school when Billy Avery had insisted on a snog. Even after all these years, she still shuddered at the memory; as soon as he had started he had been all over her like an octopus and she had been disgusted as he thrust his tongue down her throat and his hand up her skirt and, ever since then, she had no desire to repeat the performance. What had made it worse was when she had found out that he had only done it for a bet and that, as soon as she had repelled him, he went around spreading the word that she was frigid. Once again, she had become the laughing stock of her peers.

It was this social awkwardness, this failing to fit in, that had marked most of her childhood years; she had been a menopause child, born when her mother was nearly fifty. As her much older siblings had grown up and left home, she had been the one left behind to look after her ageing parents. All through her teens and early twenties she had been kept busy by their increasingly difficult demands. Then, when at first her father and then her mother had fallen ill, she had become both nurse and provider and had had no time for any social life. Now they had both passed away and she was alone but, when it came to boy friends, she hardly knew where to start, or indeed whether she wanted to. Sure, as she watched rom-coms on the telly she had vague dreams of being swept away by a masterful lover; but somehow the leading men didn't seem to attract her and, on the rare occasion when she did meet someone, he always turned out to be more Billy Avery than Hugh Grant. Not that she fancied Hugh Grant that much either. But being resigned to her fate didn't make the loneliness any less painful; she just didn't know where to start.

So, huddled in the stall she hid away, waiting for the women to finish their cigarettes so that she could sneak back out and pretend that she really was their team leader, pretend that she was happy, pretend that all really was well with the world.

It was only a week or so later after this incident that Karen looked up to see Susan, her supervisor coming towards her with a young woman trailing behind.

"Ah Karen, this is Mel, the new team member I told you about," she said as she approached the desk. "She will be replacing Mary whose retirement is now finalised. I've briefed her on the basics, so perhaps you could show her which desk to use and so forth. Oh, and don't forget Mary's leaving do on Friday, we're relying on you to give the farewell speech; we do expect the team leaders to make an effort, you know."

Without any further ado Susan marched off, leaving Karen to introduce herself. At first, shocked by the brusque introduction, she didn't say anything; she just looked the newcomer up and down. Mel was short and wiry with close cropped, spiky hair. She was dressed in jeans and a blouse but there was something not quite right about the blouse, something Karen couldn't quite pin down. Then she realized with a bit of a shock what it was, the buttons went the wrong way, it wasn't a blouse, it was a man's shirt and, combined with the jeans and the rather tough boots she was wearing, it gave Mel a decidedly masculine look. However, as long as she did her job it really didn't matter what she wore; in fact the rather manly attire rather suited her in a strange way. With a start she realized she was staring so, pulling herself together, she stood up and, with a rather feeble 'follow me' took Mel over to the desk she would be using. Her rather feeble efforts to engage Mel in conversation were met with monosyllabic answers and Karen realized with an internal sigh that this was going to be another staff member with whom she had nothing in common. On the other hand, when she introduced Mel to Sharon, who was to be her mentor, she could see that there was an instant understanding and they started chatting as if Karen wasn't even there. Muttering 'I'll leave you two to get on with it then' Karen made her way back to her workstation.

Then it was back to putting together ideas for her speech for Mary's leaving do. Much as she was dreading standing up in front of everyone, she could hardly get out of it; she was the team leader and it was expected of her. Susan had made it quite clear that her presence was effectively compulsory. However she knew from similar occasions in the past that she would end up alone and friendless, stuck in a corner sipping a soft drink whilst all around her others would be having fun. 

And so it almost was. Mary had used some of her leaving bonus to splash out and hire a room at a local pub and she had also insisted that partners would be welcome. When Karen had arrived the party was already in full swing and the more the alcohol flowed the louder it got. Karen, as ever, bought herself a lemonade from the bar, found herself a quiet corner and watched as she waited to do her dreaded speech. From time to time she wished she could join in but she knew what would happen if she tried. At best she would be politely ignored but she knew from experience that, from some of her staff, she would also get open hostility. Better by far to sit it out in the safety of her quiet corner. In her misery she was so used to being ignored that she didn't even see the young woman approaching and, as she was tapped on her shoulder, she jumped in surprise.

"Hi, I'm Lucy, I'm sorry if I startled you," the woman said with a smile.

"Hi... I'm.... I'm Karen."

"So you're the boss lady. Mel's told me quite a bit about you. I saw you sitting all alone and thought I'd come and talk to you. Can I sit down?"

"Of course," Karen pulled back a chair for Lucy. "I hope Mel didn't say anything bad about me."

"Not too bad," Lucy conceded, "but I'd like to make my own mind up. Is your partner with you?"

"Partner..." Karen blushed. "No, no, I'm on my own. And you, are you with Mel then?"

"That's right. I'm her significant other," Lucy replied with a heavy emphasis on the 'significant other' bit. "Didn't she tell you about me?"

"No, we don't really talk like that," Karen admitted, "but, come to think of it, she does have your photo on her desk." She brought the picture to mind, Mel and Lucy stood together wearing dark suits as if two grooms at a wedding. "When you say 'significant other' does that mean...."

"Yep, we've been married four years now." Karen could hear the pride in Lucy's voice. "We were right in there as soon as they changed the law." Lucy held out her hand, showing off her ring. 

"But I haven't seen Mel wearing a ring," Karen commented before realizing just how personal she was being. "Sorry, I didn't mean to pry."

"That's OK, Mel... well, she's not the sort to wear rings, if you know what I mean. She thinks they're too girly."

"But not too girly for you, however," Karen responded.

"Is that your speech?" Lucy asked, indicating some papers lying in front of Karen, pointedly changing the subject.

"Yeah, one of the 'perks' of the job," Karen replied, the irony thick in her voice.

"So you're not looking forward to it then."

"No, I hate standing up in front of people, especially this crowd," Karen confessed.

"You'll do fine," Lucy reassured her.

"No I won't, you're just saying that to be nice."

"No I'm not, well, maybe a bit, but you've got a lovely speaking voice and I can tell you're ever so clever so I'm sure... are you OK?" 

"They'll just laugh at me. A laughing stock, that's all I am to them, a laughing stock and, quite frankly, they're right, I'm useless at this and I know I'm going to make a muck of it," Karen was unable to stop herself from blurting out.

Lucy looked at Karen and could see the tears forming. "You really are scared, aren't you? Look, let's go outside and get a breath of fresh air. You don't want this lot seeing you like this."

Without waiting for an answer Lucy reached over, took Karen's hand and together the two women went outside, dodged the inevitable crowd of smokers gathered around the door, and went over to the children's play area where it was quiet. Sitting down on the swings they rocked back and forth for a moment in silence.

"I feel so silly," Karen started, "I didn't mean to...."

"You're not silly; you just don't like giving speeches, that's all," Lucy replied firmly.

"But I'm such a failure." Karen, having found someone to talk to, couldn't stop herself. "I never get anything right."

And then it all came pouring out, her fears, her insecurities, the mixed emotions over her parent's death, and, above all her aching loneliness. Lucy, except for asking the occasional question, and passing a tissue from a packet she kept in her pocket, kept silent and just listened.

"God, listen to me go on and on," Karen said at last. "You're ever so good; I must be boring you silly with all my pathetic woes."

"They're not pathetic at all and neither are you; you just needed someone to talk to and I'm glad it was me. However, we need to be getting back. Like it or not you still have that speech to make."

"Thanks for reminding me," Karen said but her voice was lighter. "No, seriously, thank you, you're very special and Mel's a very lucky girl to have you."

"I'm lucky to have Mel too," Lucy replied loyally. "Now come along or we'll be missed."

And, as they returned to the pub, Karen did feel better. She still wasn't going to enjoy herself and she would still leave as soon as she could but Lucy had made her feel wanted, liked, appreciated; feelings that she hadn't felt in a very long while.

"So what's with you and old frigid knickers?" Mel asked rather drunkenly from the passenger seat as Lucy drove them home. "You spent half the evening talking to her instead of being with me."

"Frigid knickers, do you mean Karen? Don't be so nasty, she's really nice once you get to know her and, anyway, she's one of us."

"How do you mean, one of us?"

"I mean, my gorgeous sexy partner, that Karen 'frigid knickers' Morris is a full blown lezzy even if she doesn't know it," Lucy said firmly.

"I don't believe you. I didn't get a hint of it on my gaydar."

"That's because you're too busy putting her down to see the real Karen. Do you know she's never had a boyfriend?"

"So what, I'll bet she's never had a girlfriend either."

"Yeah, but she told me that the thought of kissing a boy puts her right off, turns her stomach, meanwhile I could tell that all she really wanted from me was a hug, a hug and a lot more besides."

"I damn well hope you didn't give her one," Mel said, suddenly cross.

"There's no need to get jealous. You know I only have eyes for you. I'm not saying we did anything, or even that we would have done anything, I'm just saying that Karen 'frigid knickers' Morris likes the girls and not the boys."

"Well she had better keep her hands off you," Mel was slightly mollified. "Anyway, what's it to do with us?"

"Well, nothing really. I just thought that...." Lucy let the sentence drift away.

"What did you just think, you little minx?"

"I thought that if maybe, if we could invite her down the club, introduce her to some of the girls... Maybe if you could arrange it...." Lucy said playfully.

"Karen! The Club! You've got to be joking. Anyway, why on earth should I?" asked Mel.

"I'll do anything you want, anything at all," Lucy replied teasingly.

"You'll do anything I want anyway, 'cos if you don't you'll get a damn good spanking," Mel replied half joking.

"Ooh, yes please. Can I kiss your pussy as well? Please, please, please," Lucy kept the joke running.

"You are such a slut, do you know that?" Mel said with a laugh.

"Yes, Mistress, but I'm your slut."

"Yes you are, and don't you ever forget it." And with that the subject was dropped, but each knew that Lucy would get her way in the end. Mel might be in charge, Mel might be the one on top but Lucy, when she really wanted something, always knew just how to get it.

A few days later, when Mel came over to Karen's desk, she was wearing a tee shirt that proclaimed "I'm only lesbian for the social benefits". Karen was tempted to comment that such statements were out of place in the work environment but Mel, although she was only just out of training, was already looking to be one of the better telesales girls, and she didn't want to upset her. As it was Mel was smiling and being unusually friendly.

"It looks like you made quite an impression on my Lucy," she said. "I've been ordered to invite you over to supper and then she thought we might go on to a little club we know."

"I'm not sure...."

"Not sure? If you're not sure then you don't know my Lucy," Mel laughed. "Once she's made her mind up about something then there's no denying her. Shall we say Friday night? We can go home together after work."

"Friday... I don't know...." Karen stuttered.

"Of course you do. Here, let me." Mel picked up the phone from Karen's desk and dialled a number. After a few minutes it was answered. 

"Hi, Luce, it's me Mel," she said. "Look, I'm with Karen now and she'd love to come on Friday.... Yep, she's right next to me. Shall I put her on?"

Mel handed the phone to Karen who took it gingerly and held it to her ear.

"Hi Karen," she heard Lucy say. "Thanks for agreeing to come; I'm really looking forward to it. I'm longing to catch up with you again. Do you have any food preferences?"

"No... no... anything will do fine. Look, I'm not sure...." Karen replied.

"Of course you are. Gotta go, the boss is looking at me. See you Friday." And with that the phone was cut off.

"OK?" enquired Mel as Karen put the phone down. "You see what I mean about Lucy, there's no saying no to her. I'd best get back to work then, don't want my team leader moaning at me." Mel laughed. "Don't forget, after work on Friday." And, leaving Karen slack jawed with surprise, she returned to her desk.

For the next two days Karen was on tenterhooks. Part of her felt that she had been railroaded into something she was dreading; Mel had never been particularly kind to her and she was sure that the invite hadn't come from that quarter. Lucy, on the other hand, had been really friendly at Mary's leaving do, and Karen really wanted to meet her again. And to add to her nerves there was the vexed question over what she was going to wear; apart from the occasional family do she wasn't used to going out. There was the floral print dress she had bought from Marks and, maybe, that nice cardy she had picked up in British Home Stores. Those, together with a comfy pair of flats, would make a pleasant outfit but they would be out of place when compared to the sort of clothes Mel wore and Lucy hadn't seemed a floral print and cardy type of girl either. Well, it would have to do. It wasn't as if she had much else in her wardrobe.

When Mel arrived at work on Friday morning and saw what Karen was wearing she groaned internally; heaven knows what the girls down the club were going to make of her. She could see that Karen had made an effort, she had inexpertly daubed on some makeup for example, but she looked like someone's mum and her clothes would not have been out of place in a fifties sitcom. However Lucy was adamant and that was good enough for Mel.

"Nice cardigan," she commented dryly.

"Do you think so?" Karen said brightly. Mel's irony had completely passed her by. "I wasn't sure if it would be suitable but I'm not the fashion type, not really."

"You don't say," Mel laughed. "Well, best get on; I don't want my team leader giving me a hard time for chatting. I'll come and get you at five."

Mel's obvious disdain didn't help Karen's growing nerves and she was tempted time and time again to make some excuse, to cry off. Indeed, her stomach was playing up, the effect of her nerves, no doubt, and she wouldn't have been telling more than the whitest of lies if she pleaded a stomach upset but then she remembered how kind Lucy had been; it would be a shame to let her down. Maybe she could just go for the meal and get out of going to the club, whatever that was. For the rest of the day, time seemed to both drag and race and Karen's attention was constantly wandering. Suddenly it was four fifty and she went to the restrooms to get ready only to disturb a group of her team who had slipped out for a quick cigarette before leaving. Rather flustered by this she returned to here desk where, on seeing her return, Mel came over and led her away. As they made their way down to the car park Mel was all forced joviality, which didn't help the tension. Together they squeezed into Mel's car and drove back to the little terraced house that she shared with Lucy.

The conversation over the meal, with its awkward pauses and embarrassed silences, hardly did Lucy's cooking justice. Apart from work Mel had little in common with Karen and every subject she started seemed to peter out. Karen, on the other hand, was a bundle of nerves and too shy to give more than one word answers which left Lucy to make all the conversation. Furthermore Karen's anxiety had depressed her appetite and she hardly touched the salmon steaks that Lucy had spent so long preparing. When the meal was finally over as Lucy cleared away the dishes Mel followed her into the kitchen.

"That was fun," Mel said with heavy irony. "What's more we can't take her to the club looking like that. She'll never fit in." 

"Yes we can. Anyway you promised," Lucy replied firmly. 

"That was before I knew she would turn up looking like something out of the fifties. A retro look is all very well but she's just old fashioned. Anyway, it's Dommes and Subs night. What on earth will she make of that?"

"Don't you think I didn't know it was Dommes and Subs night before I arranged all this? Please, Mel, trust me on this. I've just got a feeling about her, a feeling that she might surprise you before the evening is out."

Mel gave Lucy a long hard look before deciding to trust her judgement. She had learnt over the years that Lucy was seldom wrong in these matters and, whilst it still looked like a crazy idea to her, Mel soon demurred.

"Well, she might get away with looking like a frump but you're certainly not. I sincerely hope that you're not expecting to go dressed like that. It's about time you remembered just who is in charge around here." Mel, feeling that she needed to reassert her authority, wagged her finger in mock anger.

"Of course, Mistress," Lucy gave a little bob of a curtsey, "I'll get changed as soon as I've dried and put away the dishes." 

"Leaving me to look after old frigid knickers," Mel sneered.

"Please, try and get to know her. She's not that bad, honestly."

"If you insist. Now come along, we don't want to be late." And with that Mel returned to the living room whilst Lucy finished off in the kitchen.

When Lucy came back down from getting changed she found Mel and Karen sitting in silence, with a heavy, almost palpable, atmosphere in the room. Karen, glad that the wait was over, looked up to find that Lucy had changed out of her jeans and tee shirt and into a short white skirt and a matching frilly blouse with a deep, revealing cleavage. Indeed, the cleavage was so deep and revealing that it was all too obvious that Lucy was without a bra. Whereas Mel's masculine attire just made Karen feel different, Lucy's outfit made her feel out of date and frumpy. She would give anything if only she could look that good, or dress that daringly. Lucy gave Karen a big smile before going over to where Mel was sat and kneeling down on the floor in front of her. Bowing her head she held out her hands, offering up something to Mel who sat up, leant forward, and took whatever it was from her. They kissed briefly and then Mel took whatever it was she had taken from Lucy and fastened it around her neck.

"There, that's better, isn't it?"

"Yes, Mistress, thank you, Mistress," Lucy said, still knelt before her with her head bowed.

"Well, come along or we'll be late."

Lucy stood up and turned to the astonished Karen who could finally see what it was that Mel had put on Lucy. It was a choker which looked, as far as she could see, like a dog collar in white leather with silvery fittings. The front was not buckled but padlocked and a silver identity tag hung down from the lock. Karen didn't know what to do or say. Indeed, it wasn't just the collar; it was what had she just witnessed; had Lucy really knelt before Mel and called her 'Mistress'? It hardly seemed believable. However Lucy&#8217;s big smile was irresistible and, not wishing to make a scene, Karen stifled her objections and got to her feet.

"Look," she said, "this club... I'm not sure it's me... I...."

"Come along, you'll enjoy it, really you will," Lucy urged.

"But I really don't think it's my sort of thing. I'm not dressed right for it," Karen protested.

"Don't be a silly," chided Lucy, "you'll be fine. Now come along or Mistress Mel will have to give you a spanking."

Again Karen was flabbergasted. This time there was no mistaking it; Lucy had just called Mel 'Mistress' quite openly and then talked about spankings as if it were perfectly normal. Karen felt the panic rising within her and she was on the verge of running away but Lucy's her mischievous smile really was infectious and Karen was fast finding out just how hard it was to say 'no' to her. Lucy held out her hand invitingly and Karen felt her resistance crumble. Reluctantly she allowed herself to be dragged along; maybe if she went for a few minutes she could slip away early without anyone noticing. For Lucy's sake she forced down her nervousness, picked up her handbag and the three women set off for the club. 

As she and Mel made their way hand in hand towards the town centre Lucy made no move to hide the collar; indeed she seemed to almost want to flaunt it, shaking her head from time to time so that the name tag tinkled against the padlock. They obviously knew the way well; there was a familiarity about their movements and Karen guessed that this was what they did every Friday. As they approached the town they made their way down some of the narrower back streets to a club which, despite the rainbow flag hanging outside, was otherwise pretty inconspicuous. Mel marched up to the closed door and knocked. A CCTV camera blinked red for a second or two and then a buzzer sounded and Mel pushed the door open.

Just inside the door was a reception desk with the woman who had just buzzed them in sitting behind it. She wore a top of flimsy, see-through material and Karen couldn't help but stare at the obvious darker circles of the woman's nipples plainly visible through the wispy material. Like Lucy, she wore a collar around her neck but, unlike Lucy's, this collar was a far more serious affair in dark leather and maybe four centimetres wide. 

"Good evening, Mistress Mel," the woman said. "Who's your friend?"

"Hi Jane, this is Karen," Mel replied. "Pass me the book and I'll sign her in."

Jane reached for a ledger and passed it over, along with a pen. As she did so Karen noticed that Jane was wearing leather cuffs as dark and as heavy as her collar.

"What is this place?" she asked Lucy in a whisper. "Why is she dressed so... so...." Karen wasn't sure how to finish the sentence.

"It's a place where we can relax together, where we can be who we are without anybody making a fuss. Now shh! We subs aren't supposed to talk without permission."

"Subs? What's a sub?" Karen whispered urgently. What had she got herself into? She glanced towards the door, looking to escape; but it had shut automatically and the locking mechanism looked solid. She'd only make more of a fool of herself if she tried to run away, First Lucy and now this Jane, dressed in these awful revealing outfits. However could they, why didn't they just die of shame? Lucy noticed her discomfort and put her arm around her, both comforting her and, ironically, trapping her.

Mel finished signing Karen in, turned to Lucy and Karen and, after giving them an admonishing look, led them into the body of the club. The main room wasn't that big, maybe a half a dozen tables in the centre and booths surrounding three of the sides. Each booth was a deep horseshoe of padded seating with a table in the middle. The fourth wall consisted solely of the bar and a small stage. It looked for all the world like any other small private club. On the other hand the client�le were far from normal, at least in Karen's eyes. The club was already about half full and Karen could see that that all the customers were women, in some cases very obviously so, but in others you had to look twice. Each couple, and it was almost entirely couples, consisted of one woman whose dress, indeed whose whole demeanour, marked her out as the dominant partner. As for the other half of the couple, it didn't take much to see that 'sub' was short for submissive. Lucy's attire was pretty conservative when compared to many and fantasies in leather or latex were quite common. Many of the subs were even more scantily dressed than Jane, the doorkeeper, their leather or latex costumes designed to emphasise, for example, their bare breasts. However, whatever the theme of the sub's outfit there was one common item: each and every one of them was wearing a collar, in many cases along with an attached leash. 

"I... I... I...." Karen stuttered but Mel just turned and wagged a finger at her and, feeling completely out of her depth, she had no choice but to stay quiet and meekly follow Mel and Lucy over to a booth where they were evidently expected. As she made her way between the tables Karen was all too aware of the stares she was getting, of how her 'normal' attire was, in this bizarre place, the abnormal, that somehow she was the freak, the outsider, the stranger. Her cheeks glowed with her growing embarrassment.

As they settled down Lucy was despatched to get a round of drinks, Mel ordering for them all without consulting Karen. As she looked around Karen noticed that whereas the dominant partners were all seated on the benches many of the subs were knelt or sitting on the floor.&nbsp; For a moment she wondered if this was where she should be sitting, as she would surely be assumed to be a sub, but Mel patted the seat beside her as an invitation and squeezed in beside her. And then, despite the rather bizarre clothing, it was suddenly all very normal. Sure there were plenty of overtones and the subs were always very respectful, referring to their dominant partners as Mistress and never talking unless told to, but, apart from that, it was any group of women relaxing together, catching up on the gossip, sharing the news. Karen, shy as ever, held herself back but, as she sat and listened, she didn't feel excluded, far from, the group seemed to accept her readily and were even keen to get to know her.

"White wine, OK?" Lucy said as she returned with the drinks and put the full glass down on the table in front of Karen.

"Oh, I don't normally drink," Karen replied rather ungraciously.

"Oh, are you teetotal?" Lucy asked.

"No, nothing like that, I just don't usually...." Once again Karen tailed off. She normally didn't drink because she normally didn't have anyone to drink with, but she wasn't going to admit that.

"Well then, one glass of wine won't hurt, will it?" Lucy replied as she knelt down on the floor next to Mel. As soon as she had done so than Mel reached into her pocket and produced a leash in white leather, perfectly matching Lucy's collar. As she made it fast Karen could see the bond between the two women; this act, which should have been so degrading, was quite evidently an act of love, a deep symbol of their relationship. With the leash fastened Lucy leant against Mel's legs and rested her head on her lap.

Tucked away at the back of the booth, Karen sipped her wine and listened to the conversations. She really wasn't used to drinking and even this small amount of alcohol was making her head swim. Add to that the way the club was well heated in deference to the clothing, or lack of it, worn by many of the customers and she was feeling uncomfortably hot. Perhaps she needn't have worn the cardy after all but she didn't want to disturb people by taking it off. She was listening intently to one of the Dommes who was telling an amusing tale when....

"Hello. Who have we got here? I haven't seen you before." 

Karen looked up and her heart seemed to skip a beat; there, standing before the group, was the most extraordinary woman she had ever seen. 









"Hello. Who have we got here? I haven't seen you before." 

Karen looked up and her heart seemed to skip a beat; there, standing before the group, was the most extraordinary woman she had ever seen. Whether it was the wine, the heat or something else, she immediately felt that there was something about this woman that was special, very special. Whilst not classically beautiful she exuded a sense of power that was certainly striking; the way she held herself, along with her dark blue slacks and crisp white blouse, were reminiscent of something military and Karen didn't need to look to check that there was no collar. There was no way this woman could be a sub. Their eyes met and it was as if she were a rabbit trapped in a car's headlights; she couldn't turn away if she tried.

"Hello, Jude," Karen vaguely heard Mel say. "This is Karen, a friend of Lucy's. This is her first time at the club."

For a moment or two longer the two women just stared at each other until, unable to hold her gaze any longer, Karen dropped her eyes.

"A first timer, eh? Does she know what she's letting herself in for? I assume that her lack of collar means she's up for grabs, unless anyone has any objections," Jude said with a laugh. "I mean, she's a pretty little thing and it makes a change to have a newbie around." She turned her attention back to Karen and once again looked her up and down. 

"Yes, very pretty and a sub if ever I met one but I can't see you properly, tucked away like that. Now stand up and let me have a proper look at you," Jude commanded, totally assured that her words would be instantly obeyed. 

It had been many years since anyone had described Karen as pretty. Indeed no one had done so since she was a child, and Jude's attentions were making her feel uncomfortably self-conscious. She'd always hated being the centre of attention and now Jude's interest meant that everyone was focussed her. On top of this was Jude's assumption that she was a sub, that she was willing, indeed expecting, to be ordered about. She bowed her head and shrunk further back into the seat, as if trying to hide away.

"Now, now," Jude said, half mockingly. "I'll let you off as it's your first time here but you'll need to learn that you shouldn't keep a Domme waiting. Come along and do as you're told. Stand up; I can't see you properly whilst you're all tucked away like that." Again there was the self-assurance that she would be obeyed.

Completely overawed by the sheer certainty of this woman, the way she just assumed control, her rock-hard confidence, Karen glanced around for support but all she saw was amused smiles; no one seemed to find Jude's demands outrageous or even abnormal but even so she felt she had to protest.

"But... But..." she stammered.

"I shouldn't have to ask twice, let alone three times," Jude said, an edge of steel in her voice. "Now why don't you just be a good little girl? do as you're told and stand up and let me have a proper look at you?"

Somehow this authoritarian approach had far more effect and she looked up and, once again, their gazes locked. As if drawn by hawsers of steel she felt herself drawn up out her seat until she was standing shyly, her hands clasped together in front of her. 

"Very nice, very nice indeed," Jude commented once Karen was standing "but I can't see your legs properly behind the table like that. Come over here and lift up your skirt."

Horrified at what she was being asked to do, Karen stared back and started to protest but, with her eyes still locked on Jude's, her remonstrations died away before they had even started.&nbsp; Here in the club other rules seemed to apply and, for all that her demands were crazy, there was something about Jude that made them acceptable. Her bluff, outspoken manner might seem forthright but she wasn't being a bully. It was as if, having assumed Karen was a sub and a sub that she found attractive to boot, it was only natural that she should want to see her legs and only natural that Karen would obey her orders and display them. Within this strange arena it would be almost churlish to disobey; to do so would be to make a scene. Feeling as if she were some sort of puppet and this strange woman were pulling the strings, she shuffled out from behind the table until she was standing in front of Jude. Then, like an automaton, she felt her arms reach down, her fingers grasp the hem of her dress and slowly lift until it was mid thigh.

"There, that wasn't so hard, was it? It's so much better when you just do as you're told." Jude took a step back and looked Karen up and down. "You've got a beautiful body; it's a crime to keep it hidden away under those frumpy clothes."

A little bit of Karen rebelled at having her clothes called frumpy but this was completely overridden by being told she had a beautiful body. Still, she had been pushed far, far outside her comfort zone and she was beginning to panic. 

"OK, that's enough for now," Jude said gently, evidently picking up on Karen's mood. "Why don't you come and sit down next to me and tell me all about yourself."

Once again Jude spoke with this total conviction that she would be obeyed. She took Karen by the hand and led her towards the back of the horseshoe where, after a certain amount of shuffling, she sat down and Karen squeezed in beside her. She felt shaken, as if she had just endured a session with her headmistress back in her school days.

"Here, let me take this," Jude said, as, reaching across, she took Karen's cardigan from her shoulders. "It's far too warm in here for you to be wearing something like that." And, as the cardigan disappeared somewhere behind her Jude used this manoeuvre to leave her arm draped across Karen's shoulders. Again Karen nearly baulked at the way Jude took such liberties but it did feel nice to be held, and she found herself responding by snuggling closer.

And then it was back to normality again but this time, as the party chatted away, Karen found herself getting Jude's full attention. Not far behind the bluster was a really warm and caring individual and Karen found her really easy to talk to. Indeed, Jude seemed genuinely interested and wanted to know all about her and, in return she told Karen a little about herself. Karen hadn't been that wrong when she had thought that Jude looked military, it turned out that Jude was a policewoman and had rushed to the club at the end of her shift, hence the rather ordinary clothing. But it wasn't just the conversation that was putting Karen at her ease; Jude's arm around her shoulders helped her to feel safe, cared for, protected and, almost without thinking Karen found herself leaning into her new-found friend. 

 "So, why did slave Lucy decide to bring you along to the club on this night, of all nights?" Jude asked. 

"Slave Lucy?" Karen queried. "Why do you call her that?"

Jude gave Karen a long hard look.

"Didn't she explain?" Jude asked. "Didn't she tell you that this is Domme's and sub's night? Why do you think the girls are all dressed up like this? What did you think was going on?"

Karen just looked blank, she was too confused to confess her guesses and suppositions, so she listened quietly as Jude patiently explained about the D/s lifestyle; what it meant to be a Domme or a sub and why these monthly meetings were so important, explaining that the last Friday in the month was set-aside especially for Dommes and their subs, a night when even couples who weren't normally into D/s relationships would play along and join in; a night when their alternative lifestyle could come a little way out of the closet. It didn't take much, she explained, to separate the part-timers from those who took it seriously. It wasn't just a measure of how daring the outfits or whether the sub was knelt on the floor or not, it was more a matter of attitude. A true Domme and her sub complemented each other, really understood each other&#8217;s wants and needs, and their partnership was far more than just a collar and leash.

"So, are you a full time Domme?" Karen asked.

"What do you think?" Jude laughed. 

"And your sub, where is she tonight?"

"You ask a lot of questions," Jude replied but as she saw Karen's face fall she relented a bit. "I'm on my own at the moment, have been for a few months now. Sharon and I, well, that's a story for another time. What about you? Do you have a girlfriend?"

"A girlfriend?... I'm not... I've never...."

"You've never what?" Jude prompted.

"I've never been with a woman," Karen said but, somehow, this needed more explanation. "That sounds... well, I've never been with a man either when it comes down to it. I just never seemed to...." Karen faltered.

"You just never seemed to meet the right one?" Jude suggested.

"I don't know, I just don't know." Karen found herself nearly in tears. Jude's suggestion had touched a sore spot, which would have difficult to explain at the best of times. She was now well into her second glass of wine and her head was reeling; but it was far more complicated than that. She wanted to say that, of course she hadn't been with a woman but, here in this club, to say so would have been gauche and uncalled for. But even that certainty was crumbling. Every sense seemed to be overloaded, the touch of Jude's body where they were squeezed together on the seating, the weight of her arm around her shoulders, the warm musk of her body, all these were awakening feelings deep inside her that were crying for release, feelings she'd never known she had, feelings she'd never experienced before, feelings she certainly didn't understand.

"Please, excuse me, I have to go to the loo," she said squirming out from under Jude's arm and pushing herself up out of the seat. Maybe if she got away for a minute or two, maybe if she could clear her head.

"Then I'll come with you," Jude said firmly. She grabbed her handbag and followed Karen as she set off for the restrooms. When they got there Jude held the door open for Karen and then followed her in but, as soon as they were through the door, Jude put down her handbag, grabbed Karen by the elbow, spun her round and pinned her against the washstand. Grabbing Karen by both arms she held her tight and, like a lioness taking her prey, kissed her hard on the mouth.

At first Karen was too shocked to react and then, as the shock subsided, a deep, deep need from within her welled up and she surrendered, letting Jude hold her, take her, ravish her. Her normal reserve crumbled as the tangle of emotions that had been building ever since Jude had first spoken to her came to a crisis and she wanted, needed, ached to be touched all over, to drown herself in these new sensations, to feel the growing fire within her consume her completely. The way that Jude was forcing her against the washstand crushed their bodies together and for the life of her Karen couldn't help but push back, her body's natural instincts trying to feed the desires within. Jude shifted slightly so that her right leg slipped between Karen's knees and, pushing it forward, she gave Karen something to rub against; an invitation Karen took with abandon. If she could just push a little harder, just ride this wave a little further....

Without warning Jude pulled back from the kiss and, for a moment, the two women just stared at each other.

"Why... why did you stop?" Karen asked, her voice breathless.

"So, you want more, do you?" Jude looked Karen straight in the eye.

"I... I... I don't know." There was no way Karen was going to admit to the power of the forces within her.

"Yes you do," Jude said, quite softly. "You want more, quite a lot more, and you know it."

"Please, Jude...." Karen started but her voice just faltered, confused over what she wanted, what she should say.

"I know what you want and, in your heart, you know what you want. I know you're scared, I know this is all a bit new to you but the sooner you admit what you want, the sooner you stop fighting it, the sooner you&#8217;ll find exactly what it is that you're looking for."

"I don't know, I really don't know...." Karen said and, beginning to panic, she started to twist away from Jude's grip.

"Yes you do; let's see if this helps," Jude said and, letting go of Karen for a moment, she reached for her handbag, pulled something out and, with one simple and well-practised movement, caught Karen as she tried to leave, spun her around, bent her over the washstand, swept her arms behind her back and handcuffed her wrists together. As with many a Saturday night drunk Jude had taken Karen from freedom to handcuffs in moments.

"What on earth are you doing to me!" Karen started to exclaim but her cry was cut short as Jude clamped her hand over her mouth.

"Shh!" she ordered. "Now listen carefully. Because you're too scared to admit what it is that you want, because you're in danger of spending the whole night dithering and wasting my time as well as yours I've decided to take control, to make the decisions for you. For the rest of this evening you're going to be my sub. A Mistress doesn't ask, she takes and tonight I'm going to take you; tonight you're mine. Now, do I hear any objections?"

Jude removed her hand but Karen was far too overwhelmed to speak, let alone object, so she just stood there, bent over the washstand with her mouth open, appalled at the liberties this madwoman was taking.

"That's better," Jude went on taking her silence as acceptance. "However, just to make sure things stay this way...." Again she reached for her handbag and, after a moment or two of rummaging around, she pulled out an arrangement of leather straps attached to a rubber ball. "You've had your chance to speak, you've had your get-out. From now on speech is a privilege you're not entitled to. The handcuffs are standard police issue, this, on the other hand...." She reached for the sink and quickly rinsed the ball under the tap. "This is something I keep handy just for moments like this and it is definitely not police issue, although there are plenty of nights when I wish it was. Open wide."

Events had moved far too far, far too fast for Karen and she stood open mouthed and amazed as Jude reached around her and placed the ball in her mouth, forcing her jaws even further apart. Within moments the straps had been fastened behind her head and she was gagged, her mouth completely filled by the ball wedged between her teeth. Jude reached back into her handbag and this time brought out a small metal bell. This she placed in Karen's hands before standing back, and gently turning her around so, once again, they were face to face.

"The bell is for safety, in case things go wrong. If you have to, if you really have to, if you find you can't breathe or something, then just let it drop and I'll let you free, but, trust me, don't do it unless you have to. I have little time for subs who use safety signals just because they're a little uncomfortable. You don't have to worry; whilst you're handcuffed you're my property and I look after what is mine. I'll take care of you; I'll make sure you don't come to any harm. Do you understand?"

Karen nodded. The handcuffs and the gag, working along with swirl of alcohol and the tangle of confused emotions within, stifled any further protests. She knew she should fight it but it had all gone so fast, she had been swept away and now didn't know how to reassert herself. She felt tears welling in her eyes.

"Shh, shh, shh," Jude said gathering her in and calming her as if soothing a child. "Come here, come to Mistress. I know, I know, it's all a bit much at the moment but let me look after you, let me take care of you; Mistress knows what's best."

This sudden switch from abuser to protector only confused Karen more. She truly didn't know what to do but it did feel so good to be held, so good to be comforted, so good to be cared for, that she felt she could stay there in Jude's arms forever. It seemed in this bizarre world that such comfort only came at the cost of being bound, being owned and, now, held and comforted it was a price she would gladly pay. She felt herself relax again as she snuggled into Jude's body, exchanging freedom for safety, exchanging control for comfort.

"That's better." Jude said, gently stroking Karen's hair.&nbsp; "Now, I could hold you like this all night but the others will be wondering where we've got to. Didn't you need to go to the toilet?"

Karen nodded.

"Well, we'd best get a move on but, before anything else, we need to get you more suitably dressed. You'd be the only sub out there wearing a bra and panties and we can't have that, can we?" Jude, suddenly businesslike, stood back, reached down and lifted the hem of Karen's dress, this time all the way to her waist. "Bloody tights." She swore. "I know they're practical but really..." She reached up for the waistband and started to tug them down, catching Karen's panties with her thumbs on the way past and taking them down as well. As she did this Karen leant back against the washstand, now completely compliant and acquiescent. Having accepted the handcuffs and gag, this further indignity just seemed par for the course. Karen felt her tights and panties pushed to around her ankles and then her shoes being taken off and replaced as the panties were removed altogether. Jude stood up and bundled the panties and tights into her handbag.

"OK, turn and face the wall," Jude ordered, backing up her words by actively guiding Karen around. Then Karen felt the zipper at the back of her dress being pulled down, her dress pushed off her shoulders and Jude's fingers tugging at the fastener of her bra. The shoulder straps were unclipped and Jude soon had them loosened so that she could completely remove the bra without unfastening Karen's wrists. With the bra hanging loose and the top of her dress still unfastened Jude spun her back round again and removed the bra adding it to the rest of Karen's underwear in her hand bag. Then she turned back to Karen pushed the material aside completely exposing her breasts. Gently she cupped them and rubbed her thumbs across the tips of Karen's nipples causing little sparks to fly through her body, sparks which centred on her core.

"You've got beautiful breasts," Jude said with a purr. "It's a shame to keep them hidden and they're lovely and firm; you surely don't need a bra." She bent down and kissed one of the nipples, ending with a little bite, just hard enough to make Karen squeak behind the gag. "Yes, indeed. I'm going to have so much fun playing with these. Still, we'd best be getting on. Now, come along." She led the still half naked Karen into one of the stalls, turned her around and pushed her gently backwards until she was sitting down. As she did so she bunched up the dress so that it was effectively a roll of material around her waist, completely exposing Karen who to all intents and purposes was now naked. "That will stop any unfortunate splashing, now, come along, we haven't got all night."

Karen stared back in amazement. Somehow this was far, far worse than what had gone before. Having her bra and panties removed had been, in some way, all part of the process but now she was being asked to do her personal private ablutions all but naked and with Jude looking on. Indeed the door to the stall had been left wide open and, worse still, she could hear someone coming into the restroom. Once again she felt her panic rising but she couldn't see much behind Jude and, whomever it was soon disappeared into one of the other stalls. Despite her fears, despite her deep concerns as to what she was getting into, she wasn't tempted to use the bell, not for this; somehow that would seem like cheating. She pleaded with her eyes but Jude's face just hardened.

"Subs don't get privacy," Jude said firmly. "The sooner you learn that the better. You also need to learn not to keep me waiting."

Realising that she had no other option than to obey, Karen dropped her head. It was hard to pee in front of someone else but her bladder was full and as slowly she opened her thighs, exposing herself fully to Jude she felt the first trickle of urine start to flow. As the trickle turned to flood she had never felt so exposed, so vulnerable, so in need of Jude's protection. However, as her bladder emptied, the sense of relief calmed her and her acquiescence grew. Gagged and bound, it could almost seem normal to pee in front of her Mistress.

There, she'd said it. She had finally, if only in the privacy of her head, acknowledged Jude as her Mistress. And, having done so, what did this imply? Jude had talked of being her sub for the night. How quickly she seemed to have accepted this, how quickly she was learning to bow down in front of this extraordinary woman.

"That's better," Jude said as the stream finally died away. "Now sit up and let me wipe and then we had better be getting back, the others will be thinking we've eloped or something.&#8221;

Karen raised her head to see Jude standing with a piece of toilet paper in her hand. As if it were the most normal thing in the world she reached down and wiped Karen dry before guiding her to her feet and leading her over to the basins where she washed her hands. Then she set about rearranging Karen's dress, doing up the zipper at the back and smoothing down the front so that it looked as if nothing had happened. That done, Jude took her by the elbow, and they turned towards the door back into the body of the club.

With a start Karen realised that the privacy of the restroom was over, She drew back, she wasn't ready for this, she would never be ready for this, how on earth had she allowed herself to be talked into....

At that moment the door opened and another woman entered the restroom. Seeing Karen's bound arms and Jude holding her she held the door open.

"Thank you, Mistress Sarah," Jude said. "Come along now, 'k', don't keep the Mistress waiting."

Before Karen knew what was what Jude took her by the arm and led her out into the club.

"Yes, 'k', that's what I'm going to call you, that's your slave name," Jude said conversationally as she half guided, half dragged Karen across the club towards their booth. "So much more suitable."

Karen had assumed that as they returned they would stand out, that everyone would stare but, although several patrons looked up as they passed, apparently her status was sufficiently normal not to merit any comment or even more than a cursory look. When they got to the booth, however, there was far more interest, and several jibes about how long they had been. 'We were wondering where you two had got to,' joshed one of the other Dommes and Karen saw Lucy grinning with delight and nudging Mel.

Jude led Karen to the back of the booth where they had been sitting before but this time they were not going to sit side-by-side. Jude told Karen to wait whilst she arranged herself and then she guided Karen down onto her lap, lifting up the back of her dress so that Karen's bare legs ended up resting directly on Jude's thighs. This also had the effect of lifting the front of her dress to about mid thigh and under normal circumstances Karen would have pulled it down immediately but, bound as she was, that wasn't an option. Anyway, sitting side on to the group maybe she wasn't showing too much. Jude shuffled about until she had Karen nestling in the crook of her arm and then, as if all were completely normal, turned back to the rest of the party. Unable to join in the conversation, or even move much, Karen snuggled into Jude and awaited the next step in this strange evening.

Now that she was settled, Karen was beginning to relax again. For all that she was slightly uncomfortable in the cuffs, she found herself feeling safe and protected in Jude's arms, as if she were a little girl again, meekly sitting on mummy's lap and watching whilst the grown-ups got on with their fun. It was strange how quickly she was accepting what had been done to her, how quickly her definition of acceptable behaviour was changing. She remembered Lucy's description of the club when they had first arrived, how she had called it 'a place where we can relax together, where we can be who we are without anybody making a fuss', maybe she was finding out just who she was, although whether she was relaxing or not was another matter. Perhaps it was the two glasses of wine, perhaps it was the gentle caress of Jude's hand on her cheek but she felt an inner warmth, a return of all the confused emotions she had felt in the restroom. Indeed, she was so relaxed that she gave only the slightest jump when Jude put her drink down and rested her free hand on Karen's knee and then slid it gently northwards until her thumb just eased under the hem of Karen's skirt. Idly, almost absent minded, Jude's fingers gently stroked Karen's inner thigh and, against her will Karen found herself easing her knees apart as if inviting Jude to explore further but, frustratingly, Jude didn't seem to notice. Karen, unable to join in the conversation drifted away, lulled by the gentle caresses of Jude's fingers and the soft warmth of her body.

It was maybe thirty minutes later that the background music was turned down and everyone looked up in anticipation as a tall woman in a red leather cat suit got up onto the stage. She reached behind the curtains and fetched out a cordless microphone.

"Good evening ladies," she announced. "Welcome to the last Friday in the month."

"That's Mistress Wanda," Jude explained to Karen in a whisper. "This is her club, her baby."

"Tonight's entertainment is something a bit special, for tonight's show; two of the subs are going to compete in a treasure hunt. Mistress Joyce and Mistress Gwen have kindly volunteered to see which of their subs can retrieve the most of these," Mistress Wanda held up bowl full of small metal objects, "in the shortest possible time. I'll get the girls to pass them around."

Two obvious subs came out from where they had been serving behind the bar and each took a handful of the clips from out of the bowl and started circulating around the club placing them hither and thither. As one was placed on the table in front of them Karen got a good look at how it was constructed and could see that it was basically a fishing weight with a metal rod through the centre, a rod that ended in a vicious looking crocodile clip.

"Now for our contestants," Mistress Wanda continued. "Ladies..."

From behind the stage curtain two Dommes appeared, each followed by a sub on the end of a leash. Both the subs were completely naked except for high-heeled ankle boots, the cuffs that bound their wrists behind their back and the inevitable collar. Karen watched in horrified fascination. How could they? How could they expose themselves so? She would have died of shame in their place.&nbsp; The two Dommes went to stand on either side of Mistress Wanda and their subs got down in front of them, each one kneeling with their knees spread so that nothing was hidden. 

"slave rita, the one on the left, she's the one which will lose, just you watch and see," Jude whispered to Karen. "She's such a little slut she just loves flashing her fanny in public and likes nothing better than a bare tush smacking at the end of it."

Karen looked at the two girls knelt on the floor. Indeed, the one on the left, slave rita, did have a big smile on her face, her knees were farther apart and her chest was thrust forward, displaying her breasts even more than was justified by having her wrists bound behind her back. The other sub, in contrast, was waiting more nervously and, whilst her position was identical, you could see that she didn't relish it in the same way.

"Now then, these two will be given fifteen minutes to retrieve as many of the clips as possible. They are forbidden to use their hands so they must pick them up in their mouths and offer them to the nearest Domme. Then, if you ladies would be so kind, please attach the clip in any way that takes your fancy. After fifteen minutes I'll call them back to the stage and the slave who has the greater number of clips attached is the winner. As motivation the loser will be punished in the usual manner. Is everybody ready?"

Both Dommes indicated that they were ready and the girls who had been placing the clips around the club waved to show that they were finished so, at Mistress Wanda's signal, the two subs got to their feet and, tottering slightly on their high heels, set off around the club. 

"Could you do that?" Jude asked Karen conversationally as the subs reached their first clips and knelt down to pick them up with their mouths. "Can you imagine what it's like performing in front of all those people?"

Karen watched as slave rita, having picked up a clip with her teeth, leant forward so as to offer it to the nearest Domme who took it and, almost inevitably, teased a nipple until it was erect and then fastened the clip to it. slave rita gave a little shudder as the clip was closed and the Domme flicked the weight gently so as to test the grip. Evidently the clip bit quite hard as it held firm under such treatment. After saying a quick 'Thank you, Mistress' slave rita then, still on her knees, shuffled over on to where the next clip lay and, in no time that was attached to her other nipple. She then stood up to move on to the next table and as she did so the two clips swung from her nipples like the tassels on some bizarre erotic dancer. Karen couldn't help but wonder what it would be like, how she would feel if it were her, feeling both the shame of such brazen nakedness in this public place and the obvious pain from the clips as they bit into the nipples. She felt her own nipples twinge in sympathy.

With slave rita taking all Karen's attention she hadn't noticed the other sub who was working her way around the other half of the club but then she appeared at their booth, knelt down to pick a clip up off the floor and then leant forward offering it to the group. It was Mel who took it from her and then motioned her to stand up. With both nipples one earlobe and a nostril already taken Karen wondered where Mel would go for and, even in the strange confines of the club, she was slightly shocked when Mel motioned the sub closer, reached between her thighs and eased open the shaven lips of the sub&#8217;s pussy, attaching the clip to the outer fleshy part so that it hung down in front. As Mel had opened the lips Karen had seen the glistening dampness, which attested to the sub's arousal, pain and humiliation not withstanding.

"Thank you, Mistress," the sub responded, with a curtsey before making her way to the next booth.

As the two subs made their way around the club they were accompanied by a certain amount of amusement. As often as not, as they leant forward to offer a new-found clip, the Domme involved would take advantage and play with one of the existing ones. Karen watched spellbound and was so engaged that she hardly noticed Jude's hand which, somehow, had migrated right to the top of her thigh, sliding under the hem to make a discreet bulge under the bunched material of the front of her dress. The tips of Jude's fingers were now all but touching her 'down there' and as their gentle caress brushed against her pubic bush it gave as much frustration as pleasure. Karen was beginning to wish that she would either stop or get on with whatever she had in mind; this gentle teasing was sending her crazy. Of course, gagged as she was, she had no way of expressing this and had to take what was given to her.

By the time the full fifteen minutes were up both of the subs were festooned with clips which dangled from their nipples, their earlobes, their nostrils and, in large numbers, from their nether lips. From the careful way they both manoeuvred it was obvious that the clips caused considerable discomfort. slave rita, negotiating her way through the crowded tables, toppled slightly on her high heels causing the attached clips to dance. Karen clearly saw her wince and tears come to her eyes. Then Mistress Wanda called them both back to the stage and had them stand on either side of her.

"Well, ladies, isn't this a pretty sight?" she said to the club. "It almost seems a shame to stop but it's time for the final countdown. Now I'm going to remove the clips one at a time from each of our contestants and the one that still has clips remaining at the end is the winner. Now, with two such gorgeous specimens, where shall we start?"

Answering her own rhetorical question, Mistress Wanda turned to first to slave rita and removed a clip which hung from her nose. Evidently removal was far from painless and Karen saw slave rita wince as the clip was taken away and placed in the bowl which was being held by one of Mistress Wanda's barmaids for that purpose. Slowly and with lots of ribald comments, Mistress Wanda alternated between the two subs until only those clips which hung from their nether lips remained. As this was going on, Karen could feel Jude's hand probing deeper and deeper, tracing the outline of the fleshy folds beneath her dress. Then, as Mistress Wanda removed the first clip from slave rita's lower lips, Karen felt Jude reach for the outer fold of skin, take it between finger and thumb and pinch quite hard. Karen gave a start and turned to Jude, horror in her eyes.

"Shhh...." Jude whispered, "keep your eyes on the stage. You don't want to disturb the show; this is their time, not yours."

Karen was right on the edge. She was shocked to the core by Jude's boldness, by the way her hand was now playing with her most intimate parts, but it seemed churlish to make a scene when the girls on stage were suffering far worse. Furthermore were she to make a scene, she knew everyone would turn and look, she would become the centre of attention and her shame would be revealed to all instead of hid away in this dark corner at the back of the booth. To add to her growing confusion, despite her nervousness, there was something about the way in which Jude's fingers affected her, sending a fantastic tingle all through her body and, if she hadn't been gagged, she honestly didn't know whether she would have been begging Jude to stop or go harder.

When, finally, the last clip had been removed from slave rita's labia there were, as Jude had prophesied, still three left on the other sub who was therefore declared the winner and received a huge hug from her Domme in reward. slave rita gave the room a rueful look in pretence of dismay but even Karen could tell it was insincere. slave rita's eyes were sparkling as the curtains were drawn back to reveal a leather-covered horse on the stage behind them. Mistress Wanda and Mistress Gwen unfastened slave rita's wrists and, each taking an arm, led her over and up onto the horse, arranging her lengthways with her bottom facing towards the club. As her wrists and ankles were securely fastened to the legs of the horse and the chains drawn tight, Karen noticed how the top of the horse was not smooth but slightly ridged so that as the sub was straddled across it, the ridge would bring pressure to bear against her most intimate parts. Indeed slave rita seemed keen to make sure that she was positioned for maximum effect, shamelessly rubbing herself against the black leather. Karen was beginning to understand why Jude had described her as a slut who loved flashing her fanny in public.

Whilst all this going on Jude's busy fingers had moved on from their pinching and were now deep in Karen's pubic bush, pushing against her skin, gently rubbing the very tip of her slit in slow, sensuous circles. Completely absorbed in the tumult of new experiences, Karen couldn't help herself; she opened her legs wider, pushing back against Jude's fingers, offering herself, anything to keep these delicious sensations flowing. 

Meanwhile on the stage, Mistress Wanda and Mistress Gwen each went with a certain amount of ceremony to an umbrella stand, which held a selection of crops suitable for the purpose. Each chose one ending in a flat square of leather, which would no doubt sting, but not cause the sort of damage that an ordinary riding crop might do. Then they went back to stand on either side of the prostrate sub and, on a signal from Mistress Wanda, they set to, taking it in turns in a slow but steady rhythm. Whilst there was a fair amount of theatre about the whole exercise, Karen could see that the blows really hurt; the rapidly reddening buttocks attested to that along with genuine squeals of pain from slave rita, but she could also see that the sub was strongly aroused. Her struggles on the horse only served to stimulate her further and the leather between her thighs was wet from her juices. Karen's own juices seemed to be flowing just as freely and, as the sub on the horse was pushed nearer and nearer to her climax, in spirit Karen was right there with her. Jude's fingers were still circling, their firm rhythm matching that of the blows from the crops and, as slave rita felt the sting of leather on flesh so Karen felt Jude give a little push which echoed inside, making her whole body sing. All the while slave rita's movements were getting more urgent, her cries of pain were mixed with far more animal cries of need and Karen, gagged as she was, could only echo these in a muffled mewing.

And then, sensing that slave rita was near her climax, Mistress Wanda and Mistress Gwen went from alternate strokes to working together. slave rita's whole body went into spasm and she forced herself down on the horse, pushing herself urgently against the ribbed leather until with a great cry she climaxed, thrashing around as much as the chains that held her would allow. Simultaneously Karen also felt the pent up frustration burst within her both emotionally and physically as wave upon wave upon wave of intense feeling washed through her and, to her horror, a flood of ejaculate came from between her thighs, a very real symptom of the power of the orgasm which wracked her body to its very core. Never, ever, had she even dreamed of anything like this and, despite this very public place, she had no choice but to allow nature to take its course and rely on Jude to hold her close to stop her from falling.

And then, at last, the waves subsided and it was all over. Drained and exhausted, Karen suddenly found herself overwhelmed by tears. Curling into a ball on Jude's lap she was wracked by sobbing, uncontrollable, inconsolable sobbing although, for the life of her, she didn't know why. Jude hugged her and calmed her, talking to her as a baby, settling her down. Vaguely through it all she heard Lucy ask if she was OK, only for Jude to reply sharply that she had it all under control.

Finally Karen got her breath back, finally her emotions came under control, finally she could start to feel normal again. Jude, sensing this, undid the handcuffs and removed the gag. Karen, able to move freely for the first time in quite a while, held her hands in front of her and massaged her wrists, bringing back the feeling where the hard metal had cut into her flesh. As normality returned Karen looked up and saw that the atmosphere in the club had changed. With slave rita's public display had come a loosening and the sexuality that had been suppressed before was far more overt now. Suddenly she felt very uncomfortable and not just because of the soggy mess that was between her thighs. She had got so carried away she had let herself be.... She glanced around the group; it must have been obvious what had happened. Everyone there must know. She felt sick to her stomach, how had she let herself be hoodwinked like this. She turned to Jude.

"I've got to go. Now!" she said.

"Oh, come on, we're only just getting to now each other," Jude said in reply.

"No, I've got to...." and, with that, Karen slid off Jude's lap, grabbed her handbag from the table and, oblivious to the stares she was getting, rushed off towards the door.

The doorkeeper was just letting her out when Jude caught up with her and grabbed her by the arm.

"Please, Karen, don't run away," Jude said almost plaintively but Karen just looked at her, shook her head, pulled away and rushed out of the club. Ten yards later Jude grabbed her once again.

"Please, Karen, please," Jude repeated. 

"No, not now," Karen said as the tears once again started to fall. "Leave me be. Leave me alone. And don't you dare follow me. Understood?

"You can't just run away," Jude argued.

"Yes I can. Now leave me be, please, please just leave me be!"

"If that's really what you want," Jude said, crestfallen.

"Yes it is. Now go away," and with that Karen was off, leaving Jude standing by the side of the road.











Come Monday morning, Karen was back at her desk, tired and bleary after an unsettled weekend. Try as she might, she couldn't shake off vivid recurring memories of what she must have looked like as she had made such a spectacle of herself, losing control of her senses whilst sitting on Jude's knee. She should never have let herself be talked into it, never have gone for dinner with Lucy and Mel in the first place, never have gone with them to the club afterwards and never, ever, ever, have let herself be kidnapped by Jude. Part of what shocked her was that Lucy had been the instigator. Whilst she wouldn't have put anything past Mel, the Lucy she had met at Mary&#8217;s leaving do had seemed so nice, so caring. And yet the sly little minx had been directly involved at introducing her to Jude and, when Jude had paraded her around gagged and handcuffed, Lucy had looked on in delight as if she were pleased with what had happened, as if this is what she had planned all along. She was surprised that a nice girl like Lucy was involved in a club like that, let alone enticing others along. Surely she would have had more common decency than that?

And then there was the dichotomy that was Jude. Whilst they had just been chatting, before it had all got out of hand, she had seemed so nice, so caring, so compatible. It seemed that Karen had found a new friend but surely friends didn&#8217;t demand the things Jude demanded, and expected her to do, or take the liberties Jude had taken without a by-your-leave. And then there was the way she took control... it was at this point in her train of thought that it all got complicated and Karen&#8217;s moral certainties just got derailed. 

Whilst Karen had been horrified at what she had been persuaded into doing, and in many ways blamed Jude for tricking her, for bullying her, for deceiving her for Jude&#8217;s own ends, as her anger receded she took a more honest look at herself and at what had really happened. As she did so she was forced to admit that Jude had given her many get-outs and at each significant step it wasn't just that Karen hadn't objected, she had actively encouraged the abuse. Right at the start, when Jude had told her to show off her legs she had obeyed without any real demur; when Jude had first handcuffed her she had been asked if she objected, and even then she had kept silent. Worse still was the memory of later on when she had been sitting on Jude's lap; as Jude&#8217;s hand had made its way �down there� she hadn&#8217;t done anything to prevent this, rather she had actively encouraged it by making herself more available. More than that, when she got home and was finally able to relax she found she was still holding the little bell Jude had given her, the safety signal. Karen could have stopped it all at any time. No, she couldn&#8217;t lay all the blame on Jude. Even if she had been bullied and cajoled, she had been an active and willing participant and, in the end, she was just as much to blame. She had been weak and foolish and was paying the price with her pride. She tried to use the wine as a get-out, to say that she had been drunk, but in her heart she knew this wasn&#8217;t true. She had been tempted and she had fallen.

And then there was the secret she hardly dared admit even to herself. Whatever the shame and humiliation, she had never felt anything as good as the orgasm Jude had given her and, for all her self-loathing, part of her knew she wanted to feel like that again. But that would never be, could never be, she had been tricked once; she would never be tricked again. She was never, ever, going back to that awful club.

And so it had been all weekend, as all these thoughts and doubts and second thoughts had circled and circled and had made her miserable. She had hardly slept and was now facing another awful week at work. She leant forward, her face in her hands and stared at her PC screen unable to find the energy to even log on, let alone get started on her tasks.

"Hello! How are you this bright and breezy morning?" Mel&#8217;s voice broke through Karen's reverie.

"I'm fine, thank you, Mel," Karen replied a little curtly.

"What a turn up for the books you turned out to be," Mel continued with a laugh. "My Lucy said you were one of us but I didn't believe her, not until I saw you with Jude. She had her hand right up your dress and you were loving every minute of it. Horny little cow, aren&#8217;t you? Who'd have thought it?"

"Shh! Mel! Really! Someone might hear! " Karen said anxiously, " and about all that, I'm not sure...."

"Not sure? You seemed pretty sure on Friday night. That reminds me, I've got something for you, a present from Jude."

"A present?"

"Yeah. She didn&#8217;t have your address so she came over to our place yesterday and asked me to give you this." Mel reached in her pocket and fetched out a small gift-wrapped package and handed it over. "Well, aren't you going to open it?"

Karen undid the ribbon and took off the paper to reveal a cardboard box underneath. Inside the box was a mobile phone, quite a basic model but ready charged and switched on. Karen picked it out of the box and stared at the blank screen as if expecting it to burst into life.

"Why on earth would she give me this?" she asked.

"Don't ask me," Mel replied. "You'll have to ask Jude. Why don't you ring her and find out?"

�Ring her? I don&#8217;t know her number.� 

�Pound to a penny it&#8217;s programmed into the address book. Go on, open it up and take a look,� Mel suggested.

"Not now. You know the rules about mobile phones at work. Maybe I'll try later," Karen said doubtfully staring at the phone, "maybe later."

And with that the conversation was over&nbsp; and Mel went off to her workstation. Karen tidied away the gift-wrapping and put the phone in her desk drawer, out of sight, out of mind. She'd work out what she should do about it later.

It was maybe eleven o'clock when the sounds of&nbsp; k.d. laing&#8217;s &#8216;Constant Craving&#8217; came from Karen&#8217;s drawer. At first she didn&#8217;t realise what it was but, when she opened the drawer, there was the phone, blaring away and with &#8216;Mistress Jude&#8217; written across the now illuminated screen. Karen realised with a shock that, of course, Jude would have noted the number so that this would give her a way to get in touch. The song just got louder and louder and, as there was a strict &#8216;no phone calls at work&#8217; rule, she looked at the keypad trying to work out how to stop it. She'd never owned a mobile and hadn&#8217;t got a clue what to do. She pressed keys at random and when the song finally stopped she was horrified to find that she had inadvertently answered the call; coming from the phone was the tinny sound of Jude's voice calling 'Hello, hello?'. In a tizzy she kept pushing buttons until the phone went silent again. With a racing heart she stared at the device. How could she have been so dumb? Of course Jude would use it to call her.

She was still staring at the phone when it gave a chiming noise and the words '1 Message received' appeared on the screen. She pressed the button marked 'Show' and the words 'We need to talk' came into view. As ever Jude wasn't taking 'no' for an answer. Shocked by the way her earlier resolve was being so quickly tested she didn&#8217;t know what she should do. For ten full minutes she just sat and stared at the screen. Although it went dark after a few seconds, the words that had been there were burnt into her mind. She had spent all weekend blaming Jude, hating Jude, and resolving never to see her again but, now that she had got in touch, it suddenly wasn't that easy anymore. To say that her feelings were mixed hardly described the turmoil inside. Surely she wasn't seriously considering replying, surely she'd learnt her lesson, surely she wouldn't give in?

Deep inside her a very different voice spoke a very different message. The idea of seeing Jude again put her heart in a flurry and worse, it stirred feelings of a very different nature. There was something about Jude that bypassed rational thought and went straight to her heart and, truth be told, straight to her groin as well. She felt hot and flustered at the very thought and could feel her resolve slipping. Maybe, maybe they should meet up. At the very least it would give her a chance to tell Jude what she thought of her, tell her that she never wanted to meet her again, to resolve all the issues that confused her so. She looked again at the bewildering buttons. How could she call? Mel had said that Jude&#8217;s number would be in the address book. What on earth did she mean by that? Karen needed help and, although the prospect was unwelcome, she knew she had to go to Mel to ask for it. Using the excuse of a training session, she got up and went over to Mel's pod.

"Err... Mel?" she said as she approached.

"Hi, boss. Whassup?" Mel responded cheerfully.

"This phone, how do you use it?" Karen, trying to act casually, handed the phone to Mel. "If I wanted to phone someone, what do I do?"

"Would this someone be Jude, by any chance? No, you don't need to answer that, your blushes say it all for you," Mel laughed. 

But, for all her joshing, Mel patiently showed Karen how to use the phone and, in particular, how to access the phone book, the phone book that currently had but one entry: Mistress Jude. As Mel explained the workings of the phone, Karen made copious notes on a piece of paper.

"I guess that's all you need to know for now but, tell you what, I'll add myself and Lucy to your address book so you can use it to call us if you want." Mel's practised fingers flew across the keypad as she quickly added the two new entries. "Seriously, give Lucy a call sometime. She&#8217;s rather taken to you and she'd love to catch up. She was quite upset when you rushed off so suddenly on Friday. Give her a shout and tell her you&#8217;re OK."

"Thanks, Mel, I might well do that," Karen replied and, indeed, she meant it. For all that she had been calling Lucy fit to burst all weekend, the thought of having a sympathetic ear was now rather appealing. To be fair, even Mel was a lot friendlier today; her surly attitude had gone now that she had accepted Karen as &#8216;one of them&#8217;; maybe some good had come out of the whole affair.

Karen went back to her desk deep in thought. If she were going to call Jude she surely wasn't going to do it from her desk. Apart from the &#8216;no phones&#8217; rule she didn&#8217;t want her work colleagues overhearing; she wasn&#8217;t sure what she would say to Jude but she knew it would be personal. She put the phone down beside her computer keyboard where it sat like a guilty secret, lying inert, a constant reminder of unfinished business. From time to time Karen would stare at it; part of her wished it would ring again, part of her was glad it didn't. When it came time to go home, she picked it up but, somehow, she didn't put it in her handbag but carried it in her hand. And then, on the bus, she sat staring at the shiny black screen almost willing it into life whilst still hoping it wouldn&#8217;t ring.

When, at last, she got home she went into the kitchen to make a cup of tea. As she put the teabag in her cup she looked at the phone, which she had placed beside the kettle, and she could no longer stand the tension. One way or another she had to get this over and done with. She searched in her handbag for the written notes she had made and, following the instructions carefully, opened the address book, scrolled down to Mistress Jude and pressed the picture of the little green phone. Holding it to her ear she heard it start ringing and ringing and ringing until....

"Karen, hi, look, hang on whilst I park. It doesn't look good if us coppers use mobiles whilst we&#8217;re driving.� One moment.� There we go. Hi, thanks for calling. I've been worried about you."

"Worried?"

"Yeah, I guess I overdid things a bit. Came on a bit heavy like. I didn't mean to.... Well, let&#8217;s just say I didn't want to scare you away and when you ran off like that, well, I couldn&#8217;t leave it at that, I really couldn&#8217;t."

Karen couldn't reply, she simply didn't have the words. She'd been all geared up for Mistress Jude and her harsh orders and now, here was the other Jude, the caring, sensitive Jude.

"Karen, Karen honey, are you still there? Please don't hang up. Look, I really want to see you again. I know I'm a bit much to deal with but surely we can work things out. Please, pretty please? Why don't we meet up for a drink? I come off duty at seven. What's your nearest pub? We'll meet up there; the first round is on me."

"Pub?... The Flying Horse," Karen said on autopilot, taken aback by the way Jude had once again taken control.

"I know the one. Corner of Radcliffe and Elm Avenue, right? That&#8217;s perfect. I'll see you in there at seven thirty. Gotta go, I&#8217;ve got a shout on the radio. See you later," and with that the phone went dead.

 As Karen put down the phone, the kettle boiled and she was grateful that she had the diversion. Why, oh why was nothing ever simple with Jude? She had been kind and caring, concerned over Karen&#8217;s welfare and had effectively pleaded for them to get together but even then she had never given Karen the chance to respond, the chance to say no. She had just assumed that Karen would be there, she had just assumed that her wishes would be followed. A stubborn streak in Karen revolted, and as she went into the lounge with her cup of tea she had all but made up her mind not to go. And then, as she sat down and thought about it, all the uncertainties returned. Sure, she could make a stand but it wouldn't be the same unless it was face to face. She really wanted to see Jude just so she could tell her, get her to fully realise, really get her to understand that....

And then Karen calmed down again. What was it about Jude that got her so worked up? She just knew she was going, she just had to and, if Jude treated her meanly, then, well she'd deal with it. 

And so it was that, come seven thirty, Karen was standing at the entrance to the Flying Horse car park dithering as usual. She wondered if Jude had already arrived and was waiting inside. What would she say? Once or twice she almost turned and ran but she knew she had to get this over with. She was still there when, with a peep-peep of a car horn, a black Astra swung in off the road, pulled in to a parking place and Jude got out.

"Hi, Karen. Wow, you look...." Jude said as she came over. "Seriously, you look great. I'm so glad you made it, I was afraid you would run away again. Come on, let's go in. I&#8217;ll get them in. White wine, isn't it?"

Karen followed Jude into the pub and they went to the bar whilst Jude ordered. As the barman poured their drinks Jude stood back and looked Karen up and down with a big smile on her face. 

"You really are lovely, you know that?" she said. "Pretty as a picture." The barman handed over their drinks and Jude paid for them. "Now we both have a lot to say so why don't we find a quiet corner and sit down? Then we can talk properly." 

Jude glanced about until she spotted an empty table where they could chat in peace. Taking Karen gently by the elbow she led her over and they sat down sitting across the table from each other. Karen had steeled her nerve and, once she was seated she was ready to make her stand. She looked up to see Jude looking at her with a apprehensive look on her face and, suddenly, it felt churlish and mean to say anything bad. The way Jude obviously felt concerned about her welfare, the way she looked at her, even the way she had guided her over to the table, made Karen feel wanted, appreciated and protected. 

"First of all," Jude reached across the table and took Karen's hand in hers, "please forgive me, I'm sorry if I went too far. I guess I forgot to take into account just how new you are to the scene. It must have all been a little frightening. Please, pretty please?"

Karen looked straight into Jude's eyes and, at that moment, she would have forgiven her anything. She was too emotional to speak so she just nodded.

"After you had gone I had a long talk with Mel and Lucy and they told me just how much it was your first time, how you hadn&#8217;t even known what sort of club it was until you got there. It was very brave of you to let me do what I did. It must have been quite scary when I jumped your bones in the toilets," Jude went on. "You must have thought I was the wicked witch come to whisk you away."

"It was a bit scary," Karen admitted as she smiled at the image of Jude as the wicked witch, "but I didn't exactly say no, did I?" Now that Jude was being so honest Karen felt it only fair to confess her complicity.

"Well, you didn't, did you? In fact I got the impression you were loving every minute of it. That's why I didn't hold back much. If you really were my sub I'd be putting you over my knee and smacking that pretty little tush of yours for blowing hot and cold," Jude laughed. "Anyway, the important thing is that right now you're here and you're talking to me. So, tell me about yourself. You told me a bit back at the club but I want all the details. You're Mel's boss I gather."

And suddenly the awkwardness was passed. Once again Karen was finding that Jude was a superb listener. She really did seem interested in every aspect of Karen's life and, as the evening drew on, they talked and talked and talked. Even when talking to Lucy Karen hadn't been unable to unburden herself like this, to let someone else into the minutiae of her life, but with Jude it was easy. She just seemed to accept everything, to understand and to share her feelings and concerns. In return Jude told Karen quite a bit. How her mum had died when she was young, how she was the only daughter of a now retired policeman who, despite his misgivings on her sexuality, had been proud when she had followed him onto the force. How she had overcome prejudices and become very much part of the team and was thinking of going for promotion to Sergeant. "That would really make dad proud," she commented. "He wants grandkids more, of course, but if I got my stripes that would be a good second best."

And then, as the evening went on, the talk had become more intimate. In a fit of daring Karen had asked about Sharon. At first Jude had been quiet but she seemed to make some internal decision and, after she had gone to the bar for more drinks, more wine for Karen and lemonade for herself, she had returned had sat next to Karen, not opposite as before, and then it had been her turn to unburden herself. "In the end we wanted different things," Jude admitted. "We had four great years together but then it all went sour. I guess, to be fair, some of the things I did to her were born of anger, not love, and that's never a good sign. The crazy shifts we coppers work didn't help much either and then, one day, I came home and found the note. That was two years ago. She's moved away now but I hear through the grapevine that she's found someone new and good luck to her. I hope she's happier now than she was with me."

"So you've been on your own for two years?" Karen asked.

"Well, apart from the occasional one night stand," Jude admitted. "Not that any of them amounted to very much. I've never met anyone I really fancied, well, not until recently." Jude looked at Karen and gave a rueful smile.

As Jude told her story Karen was seeing a very different woman to the self-confident Domme who she had met at the club. Jude was brutally honest with herself and expected no less from others. "I've had enough bullshit in my life. If people can't handle the truth that's their problem," was the way she put it, but she was also a deeply caring person and her brusque manner concealed a heart that had had its fair share of knocks and bruises. As they sat side-by-side Karen could feel the walls between them crumbling.

"So, how did you find out you were a Domme?" Karen asked. Somehow Jude's openness made such questions possible.

"Ironically it was Sharon who got me into it," Jude confessed. "We were mucking around and she asked me to smack her bottom. I was a bit dubious at first. After all, you see enough domestic violence cases in my line of work, but there's a world of difference between the D/s lifestyle and smacking your partner around. She was the one who got us involved in the club and, once we met others like ourselves... well, I've never looked back."

And then, suddenly, there was a silence. Karen looked at their empty glasses and then up at the clock. It was nigh on eleven; they had been talking for over three hours but the time had just flown by.

"Yeah, it's late, we ought to get going," Jude said, spotting her looking at the clock. "Can I give you a lift home?"

"It's only round the corner in Ashfield Street so it&#8217;s hardly worth it," Karen replied, "but thanks anyway."

Feeling slightly awkward, the two women got up and made their way out into the car park. Karen followed Jude over to her car and waited while Jude opened the door. Then Jude turned back to Karen.

"Look, I've had a great evening. Seriously, you're...." Jude started before she realised that words would never do it, and she leaned forward and kissed Karen full on the lips. To her slight surprise, there was no resistance and Karen responded as the kiss turned into a clinch, a clinch that went on and on and on until some 'look at the lezzies' jeers from a group of passing lads made them self-conscious and they broke apart.

"As I said, my house is just around the corner," Karen suggested, amazing herself at just how bold she was being.

"I thought you'd never ask," Jude replied as she relocked her car and, taking Karen by the hand she led them off to Ashfield Avenue.

Karen let them in to the house and led Jude through to the kitchen to make a cup of tea. However, as soon as the kettle was filled and switched on, Jude took hold of Karen again and they fell into another clinch. Unheeded, the kettle boiled and switched itself off again as the two women held each other tight. Passion met passion, need met need and, with their lips locked together and Jude's hands exploring her body, any doubts that Karen might have had left just melted away. A hunger, a hunger she had never experienced before last Friday, filled her body and she knew with certainty that only Jude could satisfy it. She broke away from the kiss.

"Upstairs?" She asked breathlessly.

"Lead on." Jude replied and together they made their way up to Karen's bedroom. As soon as they got there Karen started to disrobe only to find that Jude was helping, that Jude was effectively undressing her. As ever Jude was taking command but this is what she wanted and, as her skirt and blouse were whisked away and Jude's busy fingers started on her bra strap she surrendered as she knew she always meant to.

"I see you're wearing tights again," Jude said in mock severity. "I may have to spank you for that."

"Yes, Mistress. I'm sorry, Mistress," Karen kept up the joke as Jude bundled her onto the bed and tugged at the offending garments.

"Sorry? So you should be," Jude said as she tossed the panties and tights into the washing basket. And, with Karen now naked, Jude scrambled to shed her own clothes and, moments later, was snuggled up in bed next to Karen.

At first there was nothing Mistress/sub about it. At first it was just two women sharing the pleasure of skin on skin, expressing physically the empathy they had shared all evening. Karen felt a bit clumsy and inexperienced but Jude assured her that she was doing fine and, as long as she just did what came naturally all would be well. Maybe it was the wine or maybe it was Jude but, clumsy or not, Karen had never felt this free, this uninhibited. It seemed that whatever she did it was all right by Jude and her normal shyness slipped away to reveal the playful kitten within. Sometime later, as they surfaced for air and lay together side by side Karen turned to Jude and asked mischievously "Well, are you going to smack my bottom?"

"You, young lady, have a lot to learn about respect for your betters. Now, get out of bed this instance." 

Karen jumped out of bed and stood to attention, even giving Jude a mock salute.

"Go to the kitchen and fetch a wooden spatula. Do you have such a thing?" Jude asked and Karen nodded assent. "Well bring it here and you had best hurry up about it. Every second you keep me waiting is a smack to that pretty little tush of yours. One... Two... Three...." 

Karen dashed off down to the kitchen and, still stark naked, rummaged in the cutlery drawer until she found a plain wooden spatula just as Jude had asked for. She rushed back upstairs and stood beside the bed holding it out.

"Twenty nine... Thirty... Thirty-one... Hmm... let me see. Yes that will do nicely. Now, get on the bed and lie sideways across my knees." 

Jude sat up and Karen passed her the spatula before getting onto the bed and arranging herself across Jude&#8217;s lap. The anticipation of what Jude was about to do to her was making her tingle all over; there was a delicious thrill of being &#8216;naughty&#8217;. Once she was in position Jude rubbed the flat of the spatula against the rounded flesh of Karen's buttocks.

"And what are you being punished for?" she asked.

"Lack of respect?" Karen queried.

"What did you say?" Jude's voice was suddenly stern.

"Lack of respect, Mistress," Karen essayed.

"That's better," Jude conceded, "but I think five extra smacks might help you remember your manners next time. But that's not all you're being punished for. Cast your mind back, see if you can't bring it to mind."

Karen quickly thought back and remembered Jude's comments from before. 

"For wearing tights, Mistress?"

"Yes, indeed. I never, ever want to see you wearing them again. Come to think of it that goes for bra and panties as well. If I find you wearing them again then your punishment will be far more severe than a mild spanking. Do you understand?"

"Yes, Mistress."

"So, just to make sure you've got the message, what must you not do?"

"Not wear tights, bra or panties, Mistress,� Karen replied.

�That&#8217;s right. Now then, thirty-one strokes for the thirty-one seconds it took you to fetch the spatula and five extra strokes for lack of respect is thirty-six strokes in all. I want you to count and thank me after each one.�

As Jude laid into Karen&#8217;s buttocks she was careful to keep it light and playful; she didn&#8217;t want to overplay her hand again but, for all that, the blows were hard enough to make Karen give little squeaks of pain and, as the count moved into the twenties there was a breathlessness about her voice that spoke of how much they were getting to her. Under the guise of rearranging her victim Jude slipped her hand between Karen&#8217;s thighs and was pleased if not surprised to find that her arousal was manifest. She left her hand there as she went back to work and was not surprised when Karen started moving so that the knuckle of Jude&#8217;s thumb was rubbing directly against the centre of her pleasure.

By the end of the thirty-sixth stroke, Karen was shamelessly humping Jude&#8217;s hand and for a moment or two afterwards Jude left it there, amused at the uninhibited butterfly that had emerged from the shy chrysalis that had been there before. Then, with Karen very close to the edge, she removed her hand and lightly smacked Karen&#8217;s bottom.

�There, thirty-six strokes. And has my naughty little girl learnt her lesson?� she asked lightly, as if unaware of the state that Karen was in.

�Please, please, Mistress Jude,� Karen half sobbed, �please don&#8217;t leave me like this.�

�Like what?� Jude asked innocently. �You&#8217;ve had your punishment. Now, it&#8217;s getting late. I think it&#8217;s time we stopped playing around and went to sleep. Don&#8217;t you agree?�

Karen was astounded at what Jude was suggesting. She had been so close, so close to the edge and now Jude was suggesting that they just roll over and go to sleep. Surely not. She rolled off Jude&#8217;s lap and snuggled up next to her.

�Please, Mistress Jude,� she said as sweetly as she could. �Please, I need�.�

�What do you need?� Jude asked, running her fingertips up the inside of Karen&#8217;s thigh but stopping tantalisingly short of their goal. �Tell me, tell me what you need.�

�I need� I need�.� but Karen simply didn&#8217;t have the vocabulary. She reached down and grabbed Jude&#8217;s hand and pulled it into her crotch. �Please, please rub me some more.�

�Like this?� Jude asked playfully as her fingers described slow circles around Karen&#8217;s pubic mound. �Is this what you want?�

�Oh, yes!� Karen breathed as the tension inside once again began to build.

�But why should I? What&#8217;s in it for me?� Jude demanded. �I think I&#8217;ll stop right now.�

�No! No! Don&#8217;t stop!� Karen begged. �Please, I&#8217;ll do anything.�

�Anything? Are you sure?�

�Yes, anything, just please don&#8217;t stop again.�

�How about next weekend, I&#8217;m not on shift next weekend. We'll go to the club together and afterwards you come and stay at my place. From Friday evening until Sunday evening you&#8217;ll be my sub; how does that sound? Will you do that for me?� Both women realised that they had reached a tipping point and, for a moment, Karen was tempted to say no but the sensations that Jude was producing between her legs were so delicious and, after all, it was only for a weekend.

�Yes, Mistress,� she said at last. �I&#8217;d love to.�

�Well then, roll on your back and put your arms over your head,� Jude ordered. �You&#8217;re not to move unless I say so.�

Karen did as she was told and Jude set to work using all her skills, all her knowledge, all her experience and let Karen know just what it meant to be properly loved.










Come six thirty, Karen's alarm started bleeping so she rolled over and switched it off. She smiled to herself to see Jude lying there next to her, still snoring. Waking up next to someone was a whole new experience, one she would gladly get used to. Whatever her far from trivial misgivings about what she was getting involved with, she still had a warm glow from last night and felt better about life than she had done in a long while. She slipped out of bed, put on her dressing gown and went downstairs to put the kettle on. As she sorted out two cups she thought over what this all meant. Two cups waiting for the kettle to boil! Two cups! There, in her bedroom upstairs, sleeping in her bed, was her lover! This was all a bit much to take in. Not just that she had a lover in the first place, amazing as that was, but that that lover should be another woman! She couldn't suppress a little giggle of amazement at what had happened to her.

The kettle came to the boil, so she slipped teabags into the cups, filled them up with boiling water, and fetched the milk. She wasn't sure of Jude's tastes so she put the whole lot on a tray and took it all upstairs to the bedroom.

"I've brought some tea. How do you take it?" she said brightly as she entered the room and put the tray down on her dressing table.

"Tea, oh, you angel," Jude replied sleepily. "What time is it?"

"About six forty five," Karen replied. "What time do you need to get to work?"

"Later, a lot later; we coppers work silly shifts and I'm not due to go in today until late afternoon but I still need to get up and get home to sort things out."

"Of course. How do you like your tea?"

"Milk, no sugar, thanks. Is there any chance of a spot of breakfast? I'm starving." Jude sat up and took the cup from Karen.

"I normally just have toast and marmalade. Will that do?" 

"Perfect, although I'd best come down for it, we don't want crumbs in the bed."

Whilst Jude drank her tea, Karen took the tray back down stairs and put four slices of toast under the grill. They were browning nicely and she was setting out the kitchen table when Jude appeared, wearing just her shirt and underpants. Karen removed the toast from the grill, put it in a toast rack and placed it on the table. As Jude pulled out a chair and sat down, Karen felt a thrill of pleasure that made her heart sing. Last night had been hot and steamy and they had both been lost in the passion but here, this morning, it was more like being a real couple. Simply looking across the kitchen table and seeing another face, it was almost a dream come true, albeit in a rather unorthodox way. She glanced at the clock. 

"Look at the time. I'd best get ready. The bus leaves at twenty past." 

"You don't need to bother with the bus this morning. I'll run you to work. That will give us a little more time together."

Karen got another thrill from the thought that she wasn't the only one who wanted to enjoy this companionship, that Jude wasn't in a rush to leave.

"Do you mind if I'm first in the bathroom?" Karen asked.

"Not at all. Off you go; I'll brew myself another cup." Jude picked up her empty cup and went over to the sink to rinse it under the tap. "That first one hardly touched the sides."

Karen left Jude refilling the kettle as she went upstairs to the bathroom and did her morning ablutions. When she had finished and went to her bedroom she found Jude rummaging through her wardrobe.

"What are you doing?" she asked, suddenly quite angry.

"Finding you something to wear today. Not much choice, is there?" Jude replied breezily as she rifled through the clothes. "Where do you shop, Oxfam?"

"I'm not sure I like you looking through my things," Karen responded sharply, "that's private."

"Don't be a wuss. It's only your wardrobe; I'm not going through your diary or anything. Anyway, if you're going to be my sub you had better get used to it," Jude replied, slightly surprised at Karen's objections. "Here, these will do."

Jude turned around and in her hands were a white cotton blouse and an A-line skirt that Karen normally kept for best. She laid them on the bed.

"Put them on," she said. "I want to see what you look like."

At this point Karen nearly put her foot down. Once again Jude had taken control and Karen felt as if she was being pulled this way and that. Her desire to please was countered by a resentment at the way her life was being taken over, resentment at the choices that were being made for her. Finding Jude searching through her wardrobe felt as if her personal space was being invaded and the high-handed way that Jude dismissed her concerns as trivial was hard to take. But then she looked at Jude, who seemed to treat this as normal, and she didn't want to ruin the morning by picking a fight. In the end her desire to please won so, in preparation for putting on the clothes Jude had chosen, she turned to her dressing table, opened her knickers drawer and took out the top pair. As she stooped to put them on....

"What on earth do you think you're doing?" Jude asked firmly.

"Putting on some panties," Karen replied and then it dawned on her. "You mean you're not going to allow me to wear panties around you even when I'm dressing to go to work? That's not fair."

"Who said anything about fair? I seem to remember only last night, that was exactly the promise you made and now, so soon, you're going to break it. I don't think so." Jude said her tone clearly showing that she meant business.

"What about a bra and tights?"

"What indeed. I seem to remember that they too were part of the deal. Now come along, put them back and get dressed. Time's getting on."

For a long, long moment Karen looked at Jude, her panties still in her hand. Once again she had that feeling, that feeling she was getting all too used to, that feeling of being a twig in a roaring torrent, of being swept along completely out of control, but Jude looked resolute and, with a sigh, she put the panties back in the drawer and turned to the clothes on the bed.

"Good girl," Jude purred. "Believe me, you'll get used to it in no time."

"I'm not sure I want to get used to it," Karen said ruefully.

"Yes you are and yes you will. Now, stop mucking about, get those clothes on and let's find you a decent pair of shoes. Oh, and don't think you can get past me by slipping a pair of panties into your handbag. I will be checking, you know."

With a sigh Karen turned to her clothes.

Twenty minutes later they were outside the Flying Horse where Jude's car was still parked from the previous evening. Curiously, as they had set off, Karen had found that, whist she was still nervous about being so "undressed" in public it did have a definite thrill and the fact that she was pantyless was rather exciting. Even so, before they left the house, she had checked carefully in the mirror to make sure there was no way of telling. As for being without a bra, well, with the best will in the world she would have to admit that she wasn't over-endowed and, as long as her nipples didn't show through the material of her blouse, who would be any the wiser. On the way to work Jude who, of course, knew the town in the way that only those who patrol the streets could know it, took the back doubles and in no time they were pulling up outside the office where Karen worked. 

"OK then, I'll pick you up right here at four thirty on Friday afternoon," Jude said as she put on the handbrake. "I wish we could meet up earlier but that's the way it goes when you start dating a copper, you're stuck with our silly shift system. Now give me a kiss before you go."

Jude leant across and Karen, after a quick look around, responded. Instead of the peck on the cheek Karen had expected, Jude wanted, and got, far more and she pulled Karen towards her for a full smooch. Even with her nervousness that someone might see, there was something addictive about Jude's kisses and they clung together for a couple of minutes before, almost reluctantly, they broke apart and Karen reached for her handbag which was on the floor of the car by her feet.

"Hun...," Jude started suddenly nervous. "Look, I had a lot of fun last night. Really I did. I want to make this work; I want to spend lots of time with you. You're a special girl and I don't want lose you."

"I had fun too," Karen admitted. "No one has ever made me feel the way you do."

The two women just looked at each other and the car was full of unspoken words. It was Jude who finally broke the silence.

"Go on, you'll be late," she said. "I'll see you on Friday. Oh, and keep your phone switched on; that's an order."

Twenty minutes later Karen was sitting at her desk when Mel sauntered in, ten minutes late as usual. "Hi boss," she called out, "what's put you in such a good mood?"

"Hi Mel," Karen said looking at her watch meaningfully. "You're late and what makes you think I'm in a good mood?"

"You were humming to yourself," Mel said as if it were obvious. "I don't think I've heard you do that before."

"Humming or not, you still should have been here over ten minutes ago. Come on Mel, I like you but that doesn't mean I can let you be late every day. It's not fair on the others."

"I'll try, boss, I'll try," Mel said with a rueful smile.

"Thanks. And while we're at it, thanks for helping with the phone yesterday. It worked a treat in the end."

"So you did phone Jude. That's why you're in such a good mood," Mel said triumphantly.

"Never you mind about who I did or did not phone. Come along, you're late and we're not here to chat." But, as Karen chided Mel, a smile was on her face and Mel could tell that, although she meant what she said, she wasn't really angry. Ironically that gave her words more weight. When Karen had been just the boss, then anything Mel could get away with was fair game. Now Karen was 'one of the crowd' it was like betraying a friend. Mel was fast reassessing her feelings about her supervisor. Maybe 'frigid knickers' wasn't quite the right nickname after all.

In the middle of the morning the sounds of 'Constant Craving' came from Karen's handbag and she fetched it out and, whilst still bent over, pressed the answer button.

"Jude, I can't talk, we're not allowed phones at work," she hissed urgently.

"OK. Call as soon as you get a chance. Don't forget," Jude replied and then the phone went dead.

Karen put the phone back in her handbag but she couldn't let it lie and almost immediately she was trying to work out how and when she would be able to return Jude's call. She thought about sneaking off to the loo but as the smokers tended to treat them as their private smoking room there was always someone loitering about and she'd be bound to be overheard. There was no way she wanted her private life to go round the office grapevine. In the end she had to wait until lunchtime when, as soon as she could get out, she left the office to and went down to the local park to find a suitable bench . The weather was far from perfect so the park wasn't too crowded and she soon found a quiet corner. Feeling like she was becoming an expert, she got out the phone and opened the address book. Selecting the entry for Mistress Jude, she pressed the call button and held the phone to her ear. It was only moments before it was answered.

"Hi, Karen," Jude said, "look, hang on a moment." Then, more faintly in the background to someone she was evidently with. "Look, Jim, I need to take this. You go on and I'll catch you up." Then Jude returned to the phone. "And how's my naughty little girl doing?"

"I'm fine," Karen replied. Why did it thrill her so to be called Jude's naughty little girl?

"Do you know why you're naughty?" Jude asked.

"I... I'm not sure," Karen replied.

"Because you've gone out without your knickers on. Only bad, bad girls do that. I'm going to have to punish you most severely when the time comes, isn't that so."

"Yes, Mistress," Karen said at little more than a whisper. Although there was no one within earshot she felt incredibly wicked having this conversation as if everyone around her knew what was taking place.

"And how should I punish you?" Jude continued. "Shall I put you over my knee and smack your bottom. Would that be a suitable punishment for my naughty little girl?"

"Yes, Mistress."

"Yes, what?" Jude prompted.

"Yes, please Mistress. Please spank my bottom for being a naughty girl." Karen was amazed at herself for what she was saying, and more for what she was feeling. There was something deliciously naughty and exhilaratingly liberating to be saying these things in such an open space and it had got to her in more ways than one.

"You've got all horny, haven't you?" Jude asked.

"Yes, Mistress," Karen admitted, blushing.

"Well, you're not to do anything about it. You're not allowed to play with yourself unless I specifically tell you to. Is that quite understood?" Jude sounded quite stern.

"Of course, Mistress," although, to tell the truth, Karen hadn't really thought about it.

"You'd like to play with yourself, wouldn't you?" Jude asked.

For a moment or two Karen was nonplussed. Sure, there was an itch, an excited tingle, from 'down there' but this was all part and parcel of her life since she had met Jude. As for doing something about it, well that wouldn't feel right and would somehow cheapen things. On the other hand she knew what answer Jude wanted. "I'd much prefer it if you were to play with me," she said instead.

"You would, wouldn't you? Because not only are you a naughty girl who goes out without her knickers but you're also a wanton slut who loves having her pussy played with. What are you?"

"A wanton slut, Mistress. A wanton slut who loves having her pussy played with." Again the confession was intensely thrilling. There was something about Jude, which seemed to have found a hidden part deep within her, to have unlocked a naughty little girl who wanted to break free of all the rules she had lived by. It was as if Jude had given her license to indulge depraved fantasies she hadn't even known she had. 

 "Very well, that will do for now." Jude said firmly. "Is this your normal lunch time?"

"Yes, Mistress, from twelve `till one."

"Very well then; we'll do this again tomorrow. Make sure you are somewhere where you can talk freely. I'll call you. Bye," and with that the phone went dead.

Karen was shaking with emotion as she reached for her handbag and put away her phone. Part of her was shocked, deeply shocked, by what she had got herself into. In her head she could hear what her mother would have said about girls who go out without knickers, let alone girls who kiss other girls. Her whole moral compass was spinning like a top. She knew very well that what she was doing was 'wrong', 'wilful' or just plain 'bad' but for the life of her she couldn't see why. Mel, Lucy, Jude, all the girls at the club had been just what her mother had warned her about, the sort that were 'no better than they ought to be', the sort who would just lead her astray and get her into trouble. But then, when all was said and done, where was the harm? Surely something that felt this good couldn't be all bad. And the girls themselves had all been so friendly, so welcoming and, above all, so non-judgemental. For all the labels, all the condemnation, she couldn't see what was so wrong with it all.

She thought about what Jude had said about doing the same thing tomorrow and knew that she would be back here at the same park bench, or one very much like it, but, more tellingly that, tomorrow, it wouldn't feel right unless, like today, she were missing her panties. She glanced at her watch; twelve forty-five already and she hadn't had a bite to eat. She'd have to grab a sandwich from the corner shop and eat it at her desk.

That night, when Karen got home, she went up to her bedroom to get changed and, as she saw the bed, all that had happened the previous night came back to her. Here, on her own, the doubts returned. Again she could imagine her mother's voice, what she would have said about two girls in bed together, words like perverse, unnatural and immoral would undoubtedly have been involved. And, when all was said and done, the fact that they were both women was but part of it. Somehow she had lost hold of her senses and got involved in these kinky games, games where she was smacked or games where she made obscene phone calls in the park.&nbsp; There was something about Jude, something that made her forget what was right and what was wrong.

She sat at her dressing table and, more for the sake of something to do than anything else, picked up her hairbrush and started on her hair. As she stared at herself in the mirror she wondered how she had got into this mess, how she had let herself be tricked and conned into behaving so badly. Going out without&nbsp; knickers on, what was she thinking of; it was almost the definition of a slattern, of a woman who was, as her mother used to put it, no better than she ought to be. She reached for the bottom right hand dressing table drawer and opened it up. There, neatly ironed and folded, was the pile of sensible panties in plain white cotton all ready for her. She picked out the top pair and held it in her hand.

God they were boring! Boring, boring, boring! And, truth be told, they suited her all too well. She thought of how Jude had made her feel at lunch time, how Jude had made her feel last night, and how, somehow, if she put these on, she knew she would never feel like that again. And endless procession of lonely nights, each one as exciting as plain white cotton, seemed to stretch ahead of her. Could she, would she? In tears of indecision she just sat there wondering what to do.

At first, as the strains of 'Constant Craving' came from her handbag, she didn't realise what it was but then it came to her, someone, probably Jude, was calling her mobile. She put the panties down on her dressing table and fetched out the phone. However, on the screen, instead of 'Mistress Jude' was the word 'Lucy'. She pushed the answer button and held the phone to her ear.

"Hello?" she asked nervously.

"Hi, Karen, it's Lucy, is this a good time? I'd love to have a chat," Lucy gushed.

"Err... I suppose so." 

"Mel told me all about Jude giving you a mobile and said you might have used it. So? Come along, tell all." 

As with the previous Friday, Karen found it hard to resist Lucy's good nature and, although she was secretive by nature, it would be good to unburden herself. 

"I did call Jude," Karen confessed.

"And...?" 

"And... and we went to the pub together." Karen wasn't ready for full disclosure yet.

"I knew it! I knew it! I knew it!" Lucy squeaked with delight. "As soon as I saw the two of you together I knew you were perfect for each other."

"Perfect," Karen echoed. "I'm not so sure."

"Why, what happened? Did she upset you again? I was worried about you, rushing out of the club like that."

"No, she didn't upset me, exactly," Karen said slowly.

"What then? Come along, tell me all."

"I'm not sure I'm ready for all this. Lucy, please, what was it like for you?" Karen asked.

"What was what like?"

"When you found out... when you first knew... when you first found out...."

"When I worked out I was a lesbian? Lonely, and a little bit scary," Lucy confessed. "I had an awful crush on a girl at school and, if anyone found out... well, you know how cruel school kids can be. So, how are you feeling?"

"Lonely and a little scared," Karen replied. "I'm not sure if I want to... I'm not sure if I can...."

"Karen, are you doing anything tonight?" Lucy asked.

"Nothing special, just watching telly." 

"Can I come on over? It sounds like you need a friend." 

"Would you?" Karen asked, relief washing through her. "What about Mel?"

"Mel can look after herself for an evening," Lucy said firmly. "Unless, of course, you want her to come as well."

"No, just you, if you don't mind. I haven't eaten yet, can we make it after seven?"

"No problem. That suits me as well actually." And so the arrangements were made.

Karen was still conflicted as she put a pork chop under the grill and a potato in the microwave. However, having Lucy come over later meant that she could put her fears on hold and, noticeably, she still wasn't wearing any panties.

It was maybe ten minutes past seven when Karen, who had been keeping a close eye out, saw Mel's car pull up outside and Lucy get out. Even before Karen was half way up the front path Karen had the front door open and was welcoming her in. They went through to the kitchen and, after Karen put the kettle on, sat down at the kitchen table.

"So, you went to the pub with Jude last night and now you're a little confused. Is that about it?" Lucy said after Karen had finished pouring cups of tea.

Karen paused for a moment but, remembering how Lucy had been so kind back at Mary's leaving do, how she had been so understanding, so sympathetic, and, with the need to tell someone, anyone, what was going on in her mind, she knew she had to tell it all.

"It wasn't just the pub," she replied. "Jude came back here afterwards, she spent the night."

"And now you're wondering what you've got yourself into," Lucy suggested.

"Oh, Lucy! I don't know what to do. When I'm with Jude it's all so right, she makes me feel like I've never felt before and then, later, when she's gone, I begin to wonder. I mean, it's not just the whole 'she's a woman' thing, it's what we do in bed as well. Look, don't take this the wrong way but when I think about it later I feel like a bit of a pervert. And then Jude," Karen continued, "I mean she's great, I've never met anyone like her, but she seems to assume that I'm more willing than I am. I mean, I've never felt so embarrassed as when we were at the club. Everyone must have noticed, whatever did they think?"

"Lucky cow, mostly," Lucy replied, "but I know what you mean. Is that why you ran away?"

"Yes, I simply couldn't take it any more, sitting there with everybody knowing my business like that. I'm not used to it, I don't like it, I'm a very private person."

"You poor thing," Lucy sympathised. "I feel so guilty. After all, it was me that invited you in the first place."

"I have to admit that you weren't my bestest friend that night," Karen said ruefully. "But, well, later, that's when it all gets complicated. I mean I really like Jude, she's a very special person and she makes me feel the way no one has ever done before. But that scares me too; I don't know what she expects of me, I don't know if I can be what she wants me to be."

"Have you told her how you feel?" Lucy asked.

"I...," Karen shook her head ruefully. "When I'm with her I can't. Worse than that, when I'm with her I actually encourage her. I mean, back at the club I didn't exactly fight her, and, last night it was I who invited her back here; I even asked her to spank me. And now she's got me going out without panties and, were I to put some on it's not as if she would know or anything, in fact, I want to, even if it does feel... Oh, Lucy, I'm not making much sense, am I?"

"You're making far more sense than you think you are," Lucy assured her friend. "I mean, for me, some of the things that Mel makes me do wouldn't be half as exciting if I felt comfortable doing them. I know what you mean about the panties thing as well. Most of you knows that no one could possibly tell but part of you thinks that everyone must know, must be thinking what a slut you are. That's what works for me."

"This lunchtime she had me talking dirty on my mobile in the park. I felt like I was naked, it felt like everyone there could hear me say those things."

Lucy looked across at her friend. Karen had a sparkle in her eye that betrayed that, whatever doubts and reservations she might have had, she also had fond recollections. "It looks like Jude knows how to press your buttons," she commented.

"And then some," Karen admitted. "It's as if she knows, she understands, she's really in tune with what I want, what I need. I don't want to want these awful things but when she makes me do them, I'm in heaven and hell at the same time. I'll never forget the shame, the disgrace of that awful exhibition I made of myself back at the club but, I have to admit, I've never felt anything that intense, anything that powerful, well, not until last night."

"Last night?" Lucy prompted.

"She spanked me, over her knee like a naughty child," Karen confessed. 

"And you enjoyed it?"

"Well, no, how could I?" Karen started but, seeing the disbelief in her friend's eye, she relented. "It was fantastic. I don't know how she does it; I don't know how she makes me feel so good."

"It sounds to me as if you're hooked," Lucy commented. "When are you going to see her again?"

"This weekend. She wants me to spend the weekend at her place as her sub. All weekend. I don't know whether I can. I don't know whether I want to."

'You want to, all right,' Lucy thought to herself. 'You just want persuading'.

And so it went. Karen talked and talked, sometimes taking one side, sometimes the other. Lucy, knowing that talking is sometimes all that's needed, sat and listened, giving the occasional prompts. Time and time again the kettle was refilled and, by ten thirty, Lucy was awash with tea and somewhat talked out.

"Look," she said, "it's getting late, I have to go."

"Oh, Lucy," Karen said, "thank you so much for coming over. I feel so much better now that you've told me what to do."

"Me!" Lucy exclaimed. "I just sat here and listened. If anyone's told you what to do then it's you. Anyway, I'm glad you've made up your mind, but, just so I've got things straight, are you seeing Jude on Friday or not?"

"Of course," Karen replied. "I couldn't do otherwise."










Once Lucy had left, Karen rinsed out the teacups, left them to dry on the draining board and took herself off upstairs to bed. As she undid her blouse, the lack of bra underneath brought back to her how she had been dressed all day; how she had broken the taboo and got away with it. She unzipped her skirt and let that slip to the floor and stood, stark naked, in front of the mirror. She wondered what Jude found so attractive in her awkward body. To Karen's eyes it was lumpy where it should have been flat and flat where it should have been curved but Jude didn't seem to mind, far from. With a little sigh she stopped gazing at herself, reached down and picked up her dress to toss it in the washing basket before getting out her flannelette nightie and putting it on.&nbsp; 

Ten minutes later she had washed her face and brushed her teeth and was tucked up in bed with the lights out but, somehow, sleep wouldn't come. Her mind kept going back to the last time she had been there. She felt a physical hunger for Jude's presence. She told herself not to be silly, not to be so self-indulgent, but the memories were so vivid she could almost feel Jude's touch upon her skin and her body ached with want so much that sleep simply wouldn't come. Unthinking, she pulled up the hem of her nightie, and her hand slipped between her thighs.

And then she remembered what Jude had said only that lunchtime. She played back in her head Jude's voice on the phone; you're not to do anything about it. You're not allowed to play with yourself unless I specifically tell you to. Is that quite understood? At lunchtime this had been almost meaningless; at that point she had had no intention of indulging in what her mother used to call self-abuse but now, alone, in the dark, she was experiencing desires that had never really bothered her before. Disobedience wasn't really an option with 'Mistress' Jude but surely it didn't really count if she just lay there and her hand just rested, just gently, just....

Still sleep wouldn't come. As her fingertips traced gently back and forth through her pubic hair she wondered what Jude was doing; was she out on the beat catching criminals or driving about in a squad car? For all that she and Jude had talked and talked she still didn't really know how she spent her days, or in this case nights. She wondered what Jude would look like in uniform and had a sudden urge to find out. She knew that the modern police uniform was far from flattering but surely Jude would look good; she'd look good in anything. As she lay there in the quiet of the night she heard the clock in the lounge strike twelve and realised that she had been in bed unable to sleep for the best part of an hour. Idly she did the sums in her head. Jude had said that she went on duty "late afternoon"; if she made a guess at a four o'clock start then that meant that an eight hour shift would just be ending. She'd be back in the station, getting changed.

And then it came to Karen. Her new phone, her gift from Jude, she could use it to call her. Would Jude mind? Would she be cross? Would she think Karen pushy, or worse still, needy? In the gloom of her bedroom she could just make out her handbag where it lay on the dressing table. The phone was inside her handbag; it wouldn't take much to get it. Unable to stop herself Karen, without putting on the light, slipped out from under the covers, went over to her dressing table, grabbed the phone from her handbag and snuck back to bed. As soon as she pressed one of the buttons it lit up like a Christmas tree and it was simplicity itself to use in the dark. She opened up the address book, she pressed the right keys, she held the phone to her ear, listening to it ring, and ring, and ring, and....

Urgently she stabbed at the buttons until she cancelled the call. How could she have been so stupid; of course Jude wouldn't want to talk to her, not when she was working. She'd just have to wait and stop behaving like a schoolgirl with a crush. The lights on the phone faded and Karen just lay there grateful that she'd avoided making such a fool of herself. And then, just as the panic was abating and her heartbeat was returning to normal, the phone burst back into life and the sounds of 'Constant Craving' filled the bedroom. Karen looked at the screen which, inevitably, showed the words 'Mistress Jude' and, dreading the consequences, she pressed the answer button.

"Hello," she said nervously.

"Hi, it's Jude. I've got a missed call from you."

"Yes, I... I...." Karen stuttered unable to explain the impulse.

"Are you OK?" Jude asked, her voice full of concern.

"I'm fine," Karen reassured Jude. "I just thought I'd... I just thought I'd phone to say goodnight." There, that was innocent enough.

"Oh, hun!" Jude exclaimed, obviously delighted. "I miss you too. Are you in bed?"

"Yes."

"Ooh, how I wish I were right there beside you. I'd come on over this instant, except my shift doesn't end for another hour and you need to get up in the morning. So, my little sleepy head, are you naked?"

"No, I'm wearing my nightie."

"A nightie, how deliciously old fashioned! Sometime soon I want to see you in it but right now I want you to get naked so you had best take it off. Will you do that for me?" Jude urged. Jude heard a moment of two of rustling as Karen took off her nightie before she got back to the phone. "Have you done it? Have you taken it off?"

"Yes, Mistress," Karen replied. Now that she was naked it seemed natural to slip into calling Jude 'Mistress'.

"If I were there with you I'd snuggle right up next to you and I'd stroke those gorgeous breasts of yours, maybe give them a kiss or two. Do that for me, play with your breasts." Jude waited as Karen clamped the phone under her chin and a little sigh let her know that Karen was doing as she was told. "Are you doing it?" she asked, "are your nipples getting firm."

"Ummmm," Karen purred in response.

"Do you like me kissing your breasts? Shall I bite them? Shall I bite your hard little nipples? Shall I?"

"Oh, yes please, Mistress," Karen sighed.

"And while I'm nibbling your nipples what's my hand doing, where is it?"

"It's down there, Mistress, down between my thighs."

"Down where?" Jude queried.

"Between my thighs," Karen repeated.

"Be more specific. Where between your thighs?" Jude asked firmly.

"It's playing with my...," Karen's shyness cut in whenever she was talking about 'down there', it wasn't a subject for 'nice' girls and, even now, and it was hard for her to say the words. "It's playing with my... my slit, Mistress." There, she'd done it and it was deliciously liberating to 'talk dirty' like that.

"And what's it doing?" Jude went on.

"Playing with me, oh, Mistress, please, please may I...." Karen hadn't realised how worked up she had been even before the call and now Jude's words were going straight to the core of her being and she was fast losing control.

"Please may you what?" Jude of course knew perfectly well what Karen wanted but she was insisting on hearing the words.

"Please may I play with myself?" Once again there was that thrill, this time even more so, but when talking to Jude it was somehow easy.

"Only naughty, naughty little girls play with themselves." Jude spoke as if talking to a five year old. "Are you a naughty little girl?"

"Yes, Mistress. Please, Mistress," Karen gasped. Her right hand had moved down to her lower stomach and she was rubbing in circles whilst she had her legs clamped together trying to get whatever pressure she could to bear without actually touching, without actually breaking the rules that Jude had laid down.

"And does my naughty little girl deserve a spanking, or maybe something more severe?" Jude continued.

"I don't know, Mistress," Karen confessed. "More severe?"

"I've got a school cane at home, nice and whippy. Maybe that might sort out your dirty little habits."

"I'm not sure, Mistress," Karen replied, both scared and thrilled by the thought of the cane. "I couldn't take too much pain."&nbsp; 

"You'll take what you're given, young lady," Jude snapped.

"Tango Delta Seven. Tango Delta Seven. Come in Tango Delta Seven." Even over the phone Karen clearly heard the sounds of a radio in the background. 

"This is Tango Delta Seven," she heard Jude reply.

"RTA on the corner of Church Street and Maple Avenue," the radio continued. 

"On my way," Jude replied.

"That's it I'm afraid. Duty calls. Goodnight my darling. I have to be off." Jude said suddenly normal.

"But what about...?" Karen gasped. The radio in the background had been like a bucket of cold water thrown over her but she still had unresolved needs.

"That will have to wait until Friday and if I find out that you couldn't wait...." Jude said left the threat hanging. "Now say goodnight. I really do have to go."

"Goodnight, Mistress," Karen said meekly.

"Goodnight, my lover. I'll call you tomorrow lunch time."

And with that the phone went dead. Karen stared at it for a moment in disbelief but there was no denying that Jude did have to go and that their phone call had to end. However, for all the frustration with the call being cut short, Jude's pleasure at being called in the first place was self evident, and not just so that they could talk dirty. She had obviously been delighted that Karen had wanted to call. This reassurance did much to settle Karen and, despite her increased frustration, she found herself drifting off at last.

The next morning Karen went through her morning routine as usual until, when it came to time to get dressed and she found herself reaching for her panties drawer, she stopped. She knew that she would be on the phone with Jude that lunchtime and she knew that the question of whether she was wearing panties was bound to come up. But it wasn't just the potential for awkward questions at lunchtime; there were other forces in play as well. Firstly there was a desire to please Jude, to show that she would play along with the game, or whatever this was that they had got involved with. On another level there was the undoubted pleasure of being "naughty", of knowing that, were her mother still alive, she would have been shocked to the core by the very thought. I mean, what would the neighbours say? The conflict between Jude's rules and the rules she had been brought up by generated a rebellious spark within her and, smiling to herself, she shut the drawer again. 

All through the day, in all sorts of ways, Karen found herself thinking of Jude. She seemed to be constantly aware of her body and of the unresolved tensions that Jude had left her with. Although she wasn't overly endowed, and going without a bra wasn't uncomfortable, she still found herself constantly aware of the touch of her dress against her nipples. Never before had they seemed so sensitive.&nbsp; And first thing, as she had walked to the bus stop, the way the cool morning air circulated around her bare legs was a reminder, as if she really needed one, of how she was naked under her dress. And then to cap it all there was the phone call. Come lunchtime she was first away from her desk and off to the park, anxious to be settled before Jude called her. By the time she returned to the office, barely making it back to her desk before the appointed time, she was once again hot and flustered but strangely elated.

That evening, her mobile became a time bomb. During their lunchtime call, Jude had told her that she would be phoning 'to say goodnight' but she couldn't say when, as she didn't know when she would be free. Time and time again, as she sat in front of the telly, Karen checked the phone, checked that she was getting a signal, checked that it was fully charged, checked that there were no missed calls Not that there could have been as it had never left her side. At ten thirty she took herself to bed, this time foregoing the nightie. It was nigh on midnight before Jude finally did ring and, once again, there was that mixture of concern and outrageous demands. Jude, having ascertained that Karen was in bed naked and that the lights were out, ordered her to go and stand in front of the window and open the curtains. In the deep shadow of the darkened room she probably wasn't that visible but it was possibly the most nerve wracking ten minutes of her life. When a late night dog walker went by Karen thought she would die of shame but, with Jude ignoring her pleas and ordering her not only to stay but to play with herself as she did so. Karen obeyed, remaining at the window throughout and, as the man passed without an upward glance, she was finally able to breathe again.

Afterwards, as Karen lay in bed, she was still shocked and unnerved by what Jude had made her do. She had felt so naked, so exposed; dammit she had been naked and exposed and it was only good fortune that she hadn't been spotted. One glance, just one glance in the wrong direction and the dog walker would have seen her. Although her rational self realised that the danger hadn't been too great, she had been mostly in shadow and her hand had been below the level of the window sill, it didn't feel like that. She might as well have been standing in the street for all to see. Whatever would the dog walker have thought of her, parading herself about as if... as if.... Even now that it was all over, the shame of what she had done made her cheeks burn. How could she have been such a trollop?

And that was the big question. Whist she had been there, pleading with Jude to allow her to stop, to step back from the window, to close the curtains, the only thing that had really kept her there was her. For all that she had been on the verge of tears, for all that she had denied repeatedly Jude's repeated assertions that she was loving every minute of it, secretly she had been thrilled. The shame and embarrassment had been matched by an excitement, an excitement both physical and emotional, an excitement she was getting all to used to, an excitement she was fast becoming addicted to. Sure she needed Jude to push her; without Jude she would never have had the nerve to stand like that, but it was like a drug, a drug that lured her in and was dangerously addictive.

By the time Friday rolled around Karen was in a complete tizz. As she had gone through her morning routine she had carefully chosen her prettiest frock to wear. It had a bodice that buttoned down the front and, as she fastened the buttons she couldn't help but think of Jude undoing them later. Then she packed a small overnight bag; she didn't need much, just her wash things and a couple of changes of clothes. She wondered if she should pack some underwear but, after a few minutes calculation on her diary to double check, she knew she wouldn't need any. Then, locking the door carefully behind her, she set off to work. She was, as ever, first in the office so she was able to slip her bag underneath her desk where it wouldn't be noticed. However, when she tried to settle down to work the day just seemed to drag on and on and she had difficulty concentrating on anything. A text from Jude cancelling their lunchtime phone call didn't help much and, come lunchtime, she decided to forego the park and&nbsp; sat at the rest area eating her sandwiches when Mel wandered over.

"Hi, Karen," she said as she approached, "you're all dressed up today. Got a date tonight, have we?" Karen blushed and dropped her head but that wasn't enough to put Mel off. "It seems to me I saw an overnight bag tucked under your desk. Is someone staying out tonight? Has our Jude got lucky?"

"Please, Mel!" Karen protested.

"I'll take that as a 'yes', then," Mel laughed. "But seriously, good on ya, and don't forget to phone Lucy with all the gossip on Monday, then she can pass it on to me."

Karen was once again going to protest but, when she looked up at Mel, she could see that it was well meant and that Mel's joshing was friendly, not mean spirited. "Maybe I am seeing someone tonight," she admitted.

"Oooh, you little devil," Mel said, still laughing. "Still, that means we may well see each other later. We all tend to meet up down at the club and hang out together, or maybe she has more important things to do."

"I'm not sure what she's planned."

"Well, we'll have to see then, won't we. Catch you later," and, with that, Mel was off out to the pub for the Friday lunchtime session with the rest of the girls.

If the morning had dragged then so too did the afternoon. At four o'clock, just as Karen was starting to pack up for the weekend, Susan, her team leader, came over to discuss the finer details of that month's figures and Karen had to feign interest. Susan seemed in no hurry to leave and, as four thirty came and went, she droned on and on about productivity targets and how they were not being met. Karen couldn't help but keep glancing at the clock, which, now that work was officially over, was starting to race ahead. It was nigh on five when Susan commented that she didn't seem to have Karen's full attention.

"I'm sorry, Susan," Karen replied. "I'm meeting someone after work and I don't want to keep them waiting too long."

"I suppose we had better wrap this up then," Susan responded crossly. "However, I hope I've made my point. We expect far more from this team than it is providing and, as team leader, it's your responsibility to ensure that targets are met. We've turned a blind eye for quite a while but it can't go on forever. This whole team needs to pull its socks up."

"Yes, yes, I can see that," Karen replied meekly.

"Good. because I will be keeping an eye on you," and, with the knowledge that she had done a successful job of bullying, Susan strode off back to her office.

As soon as she had gone Karen logged out of her computer, grabbed her bag from beneath her desk and rushed off out of the building. What if Jude wasn't there? What if she had given up on waiting? What if she had been and gone? As Karen emerged from the front doors, her heart leapt and she gave a huge sigh of relief. There, standing patiently on the other side of the road was Jude. Until this point Karen hadn't realised just how much she wanted to be with her, just how much simply seeing her made her pulse race. With barely a glance at the traffic, Karen rushed over and straight into Jude's waiting arms.

"I'm so sorry I'm late," Karen said as they broke from their hug. "Bloody Susan just went on and on about those stupid figures."

"You poor thing," Jude replied. "I hope she didn't upset you too much. Now let's put work behind us and get on with having some fun. Is that your bag?" Jude stretched out her hand and took the overnight bag from Karen. "I'm parked up in the multi-storey. Come along," and taking Karen by the hand, she led her away.

Jude's car, when they got there, was parked in a quiet corner of the car park. Jude shepherded Karen round to the passenger side and held the door open for her. These simple actions made Karen feel cared for and protected. Jude was, in many ways, more of a gentleman than most of the men Karen had ever met. Jude put Karen's bag in the boot and went round to the driver's side and got in but, instead of pulling off directly she turned and looked Karen up and down.

"Is slave 'k' dressed correctly?" She asked, a big smile on her face. 

"Err... Yes, Mistress," Karen replied. She had forgotten that 'k' was her 'slave' name.

"Show me then." 

"What?"

"Show me. Lift up the hem of your dress and show me." Jude was beginning to sound impatient.

"What? Here?" 

"It would seem that I need to get some things straight right from the start. I do not expect to have to ask three times, nor do I expect to have my orders questioned." Jude was calmly angry. "Now, I'm being easy on you because you're new to this but I don't expect to have to ask again. Lift up the hem of your dress and show me that you are properly attired."

At first Karen was going to demur again but, after glancing about to check that no one was anywhere nearby, she eventually reached down and took the hem of her dress in her hands and, still glancing around her, started to slowly pull it up her thighs. The farther she got the more she was held back by the part she was sitting on, so, after a quick glance at Jude to ensure that she was still serious, she undid her seatbelt so as to lift herself up off the seat and free it. By the time she was finished most of the material was bunched around her waist and, by pulling the front upwards, she exposed her naked groin and the bushy tangle of her pubic hair.

"That's better," Jude purred. "It's so much easier when you do as you're told." She leaned across and kissed Karen full on the mouth, her hands ranging across Karen's torso as she did so. As the kiss continued Jude's hands inevitably ended up on Karen's breasts, her fingers searching out her nipples through the fabric of her blouse. This attention had the immediate effect of hardening them and making them stand proud, a fact not lost on Jude who took each one between finger and thumb and pinched hard causing Karen to squeak with surprise. At that Jude broke free, and, as if nothing out of the ordinary had just happened, sat back in her seat and did up her seat belt. Karen, completely flustered, looked around once again to see if anyone had been watching. She could just imagine the gossip that would flow if she were spotted 'snogging' another woman this close to the office, let alone if anyone were to see her exposed thighs.

"So, how are you?" Jude asked as she put the car into gear and pulled away. "Missing your Mistress Jude?"

"I'm fine. Please, Mistress, can I pull my dress down?" Karen asked as she refastened her seatbelt.

"Oh, no," Jude said, "that would never do. In fact I think you ought to open your knees a bit, let the air circulate." Jude was fully occupied with driving as they navigated the exit ramp and pulled out of the car park onto the main road but as soon as they had to stop at some lights Jude reached across, tucked the material of Karen's skirt under the waistband of the seatbelt and gently pushed Karen's thighs apart. Having done so, she slid her hand up Karen's thigh until her hand was resting against the lips of her sex. Softly, sensuously she eased the edge of her little finger against Karen's&nbsp; labia, opening her up. "There, is that nice?" she asked.

Karen really was far too flustered to answer. She was scared witless by being so exposed in public; she couldn't believe Jude was doing this to her. How could she stay so calm? This was even worse than standing at the window; there was a line of traffic in the lane to the right of them and she was sure that the driver in the nearest car would be able to see everything. Similarly, only a couple of cars away, a number of pedestrians were crossing the road; surely any one of them would be able to see her so brazenly on display. Having said that, the sense of danger was getting to her groin which, combined with the fantastic feelings from Jude's fingers, meant that she really didn't know if she wanted Jude to stop or continue. She was still searching for an answer when the lights changed and Jude took her hand away and turned back to her driving.

It wasn't far to Jude's house and she kept away from the town centre but, even so, by the time they arrived Karen was shaking like a leaf with the constant fear of exposure. Jude parked the car and looked across at Karen.

"Are you OK?" she asked, her voice full of concern. "I mean, are you really up for this?"

"I'm fine," Karen replied although, inside, she was anything but. 

"Once we go inside you become my sub, my slave 'k', and you'll find I'm a hard Mistress. If you're having any second thoughts about this then now is the time to back out."

Second thoughts? Karen was well beyond second thoughts and on to third, forth or even fifth thoughts by now and the drive across town had done nothing to settle her nerves but, and it was a huge but, she knew that were she to back out now she would regret it, that she would forever wonder what she had missed and that her new found relationship with Jude would be damaged, probably beyond repair. Anyway, she had promised.

"No, I want to do this," she said firmly, persuading herself as much as anything.

"Good girl. Now, you know the safe word, use it if you really have to but, other than that, once we enter my house I expect complete obedience, is that fully understood?"

"Yes, Mistress."

"Come along then." Jude got out of the car, went round and opened the door for Karen, holding it for her as she got out. Once again there was this old fashioned formality, this sense of being cared for and protected. For all that she was walking willingly into the lion's den Karen had never felt as safe as when she was around Jude. Jude took her hand and led her to the front door.

The house was part of a Victorian terrace, three stories high and solidly built. Whilst the building showed obvious signs of wear and tear it was well maintained and the front garden was clean and tidy. Net curtains at the windows gave privacy from the street and, from the outside it was just another house amongst many, just another private residence. Jude opened the door and led her inside. Here the well maintained original features continued. The hall floor was tiled with little squares of blue and white ceramics and the woodwork, where not painted, was the deep rich brown of well-varnished natural oak. Karen gawped at her surroundings, taking it all in. She was barely aware of the door closing behind her until she felt Jude grab her shoulders and spin her around; her strong arms gathering her in, enveloping her and holding her tight as she kissed her long and hard.

Karen was completely overwhelmed and, even if she had wanted to, she couldn't have fought Jude off. Jude kissed her hard and strong, leaving her breathless and dizzy. And then Jude's kisses started to range to her neck, to her shoulders, to her throat. Karen leant her head back, exposing herself as she felt Jude's teeth scrape across her flesh. It was as if, at any moment, Jude might bite; Karen the helpless gazelle to Jude's lioness. She felt Jude reach up between them, her fingers reaching for the buttons on her dress but, instead of undoing them, she gave a sudden violent tug wrenching it apart, ripping it to the waist as buttons flew everywhere. A small part of Karen cried out at this vandalism to her best dress but this was drowned out by this other voice that cried out 'Take me, take me now!' Without loosening her grip more than was absolutely necessary Jude continued to tug the torn material, ripping it from her shoulders and pushing it roughly down to her waist and beyond so that in moments Karen was naked apart from her shoes. Then breaking from the kiss, she placed her hands on Karen's shoulders and pushed her to the floor. As one hand held Karen's head by her hair the other urgently undid her belt and her jeans and pushed them out of the way. Then, using both hands, she pushed Karen's face into her naked groin.

"That's where you belong, isn't it?" Jude asked rhetorically. Karen, still reeling from the way her dress had been torn from her, the way she had been thrust to her knees, the way her head was held tight to Jude's body, could barely breathe, let alone speak, but she knew Jude was right and responded by kissing the well trimmed bush in front of her face.

"Use your tongue, show your Mistress how you love her, go on, use it!" Jude commanded. Karen wasn't too sure what to do. Her experience in lovemaking was limited to what Jude had taught her the previous Monday and, whilst there had been plenty of kisses none of it had been "down there". Tentatively she stuck out her tongue and licked at Jude's mons but it wasn't until, by luck rather than good judgement, her tongue was pushed against Jude's nether lips that a curt 'Yes, that's right, just there,' told Karen what was required. Then it was as if the tug of Jude's hands against the back of her head was directly transmitted to her tongue as it pushed the folds of skin aside and the earthy taste that Jude had left on her fingers last time was now being savoured at its source. As she probed around, she could feel the hard little bud of Jude's clitoris already swollen with passion and, mirroring the fervour of how she had been taken, she worked at it with firm flicks back and forth, back and forth. Jude just gripped her head tighter and pulled her even harder into her groin.

Suddenly, without warning, Jude pushed her away and looked down at her, her eyes sparkling with pleasure. Then, without saying a word, she reached down, took Karen by the arm and pulled her to her feet. After a quick but fiery kiss she pulled at her jeans that were bunched around her knees as, with the other hand, she half led, half dragged Karen across the hallway and up the stairs to her bedroom where she swept her onto the bed and jumped on top of her. Here the torrent of kisses continued and, lying beneath, Karen could only surrender. Even as they kissed Karen felt Jude take her arms and pull them towards the headboard. Something hard was fastened around her wrists and....

"Stay there!" Jude ordered as she knelt upon the bed. Her eyes were wild with emotion and her breathing was heavy. 

As her fingers scrabbled at the buttons of her shirt Jude kicked off her shoes without bothering to unfasten the laces; Karen heard the 'clump'- 'clump' as they fell to the floor. Feverishly she wriggled&nbsp; out off her jeans, taking off her underpants as she did so. From where she lay, Karen looked on as Jude's lean lithe form emerged; there was something about this body that kept her spellbound. Sure, Jude was, in the conventional senses of the terms, handsome rather than beautiful, but her slim athleticism held a deep fascination for Karen and just looking at her woke hungers within. Naked at last, Jude resumed her attack, not just kissing but enjoying the animal pleasure of flesh on flesh. Although Jude was, quite unashamedly, using Karen's body directly for her own pleasure and any direct stimulation that Karen might get was purely accidental, Karen had never felt anything so exciting in her life and being used, being needed, being wanted, was all that she desired.

And then Jude turned around and, kneeling either side of Karen's armpits, lowered herself down until she was rubbing her core directly against Karen's mouth. This time it there was no doubt what Jude wanted, indeed, Karen had little choice over her movements so she reached out with her tongue and slid it back and forth across the nub of Jude's pleasure.

"Yes, yes, like that but harder, I said harder!" Jude urged as she leant forward, leaning on Karen's thighs and riding her captive mercilessly. Karen, her face crushed beneath Jude's weight and gasping for breath whenever she was able, had no choice but to comply and they rode together, the intensity building and building until Jude seemed to be resting her full weight on Karen, grinding her into the mattress. With a cry of 'Don't stop, don't stop, don't you dare stop, oh my God!!!' she climaxed, shuddering with the intensity of it all.

For a couple of moments the only noise in the room was Jude's panting as she got her breath back. Karen, still crushed below Jude's kneeling form ,turned her head so that she could breathe, and then, gently, slowly, Jude rolled off her, turned around and lay down full length beside her. Now that the passion was spent Jude was gentle, caring, stroking and caressing Karen's still shackled body.

"Not bad... for a beginner," she joked. "I think I might just leave you here chained to my bed and come back whenever I need a fix."

"I'd... I'd like that." Karen replied before she could stop herself. It had been instinctive, a voice from the heart rather than the brain and, now it was out there, she was ashamed of admitting to her desire so openly but, and Karen was beginning to understand this, the thought of being left there, to be used and abused at her Mistress' will, had an appeal that brought heat to her groin as well as her cheeks.

Jude propped herself up on one elbow and looked Karen in the eye.

"Would you, indeed?" She leant forward kissed Karen long and hard. "My little sex slave, chained to my bed; you need to be careful or you might just get what you asked for but we haven't got time for that right now; we need to sort out some food and get dressed to go out. We both need a shower and you," Jude reached down to the unruly bush of Karen's pubic hair, "you need a good trim."

Jude reached for the shackles that held Karen's wrists and undid them. Then they got up off the bed and she led Karen by the hand out of the bedroom and along the landing towards the bathroom. Jude seemed perfectly at ease walking about naked but it felt odd to Karen; at home she wouldn't have dreamed of going about the house with nothing on; it just wasn't 'done'. As they passed the top of the stairs Karen glanced down and saw the tattered remnants of her dress lying on the hall floor where Jude had ripped it from her. Even at that distance she could tell it was torn beyond repair. Part of her regretted the money lost but this was overridden by the memories of being ravished; she gladly sacrifice a dress any day for that. Did Jude know that she had a change of clothing in her overnight bag; did she even care? Meekly she followed on.









Jude's spacious bathroom was a consequence of the Victorian layout of the building, but that was the only thing that was old fashioned about it. It had been extensively modernised and all the fittings were to the latest standard, including a bidet, an enormous free-standing bath and a shower cubicle big enough for the both of them. Karen looked around in a mixture of amazement and envy.

"Good, isn't it?" Jude commented, with a note of pride in her voice. "I came into quite a bit of money when my aunt died, and I spent most of it on the house; I rather like my creature comforts. Now, before we get in the shower, there's something I've been meaning to do ever since I met you; I can't be doing with untidy pubic hair, so that thatch of yours has got to go. Sit on the edge of the bath."

Up to that point Karen had never even considered trimming her pubic hair; it wasn't the sort of thing done by 'nice' girls, but now even this most intimate part of her was under Jude's control. So she wasn't about to demur as she perched on the rim of the porcelain bath, whilst Jude went over to the bathroom cabinet to fetch out an electric razor and a comb. With a curt 'open wide' Jude nudged Karen's knees apart and knelt down in front of her. First she ran the comb through Karen's pubic hair, combing it as straight as possible before using the comb as a guard, laying it flat against Karen's body and using the clipper attachment on the razor to shave off anything that protruded. In this way it was no time before the entire area was trimmed so that the remaining hair was only the length of the comb's width. With this done, Jude set to work shaving the bikini line so that all that was left was a neat triangle of short fuzz. Although Jude was being totally matter of fact about what she was doing, there was no getting away from the fact that she was using a vibrating electric motor around Karen's most sensitive parts, and Karen found the smorgasbord of sensations teasingly arousing. 

"There, that will do for now," Jude commented as she brushed away a few remaining hairs and stood back up. "I don't expect to have to do this again. It's up to you to look after it from now on; you'll get punished if it's not up to my standard. Now, come along, let's get in the shower." 

Whilst Jude went over and fiddled with the controls of the shower Karen stood up and looked at herself in the mirror. With the protective covering of hair all but gone she looked open and exposed; and she couldn't help but reach down and run her fingers across the short fuzz that Jude had left, feeling the texture with the tips of her fingers. Simply doing that gave her delicious tingle and as her fingertips teased at the stubble she was becoming increasingly aware of how long she had been kept waiting for release. Jude, finally satisfied by the water temperature looked over at Karen. 

"Did I say you could play with yourself?" She snapped.

"No, no Mistress, I'm sorry Mistress," Karen admitted, shamefaced at being caught masturbating. 

"Well stop it at once and get in the shower." Jude held the cubicle door open and motioned Karen to get in. Jude evidently had no problem with water pressure as, when Karen was positioned underneath the showerhead, the water pummelled her skin in a delicious massage. Karen was enjoying the shower and wondering just what was required of her when Jude took control and, telling Karen to stand still, washed her down, first shampooing her hair and then soaping her body with a fragrant shower gel. Again Jude seemed to be making a point of being businesslike rather than sensuous, which reinforced the objectification that Karen was feeling; although Jude was doing all the work Karen was still the submissive one, she was a toy, a possession, Jude's to own and control. Having said that it still seemed to Karen that Jude was maybe a little overzealous when it came to shampooing her groin, both front and back, not that she was complaining. 

As Jude eased the soapy gel up and down the crack of her bottom Karen was in sheer heaven and when Jude used the lubricity of the gel to slip the tip of her finger past the rosebud of Karen's anus, she couldn't help but squeak with delight. Jude responded by pushing further and a combination of the warm water, the feel of Jude's soapy skin as they stood close together, and the tip of Jude's finger as it invaded her backside was almost too much for Karen and she found herself pushing rhythmically against Jude's body trying to get pressure to bear on the core of her sex.

"You like that, don't you?" Jude said, her first words since they had entered the shower.

"Ooh, yes, yes please, Mistress," Karen replied breathlessly as she humped away.

"And do you want a little more?" Jude pushed her finger just a fraction deeper.

"Yes, yes please," Karen urged.

"Well you'll just have to wait." Jude removed her finger, pulled away and reached again for the shower gel. "Now stand still whilst I finish washing you. I can't be doing with all this wriggling about."

"Oh please, please Mistress, please don't stop," Karen begged, still trying to rub herself against Jude's body. "I'm so close, I've waited so long."

"You, young lady, are going to have to learn to control yourself. Now stand still and let me finish off."

Felling like a five-year-old who had been told to stand in the corner, Karen hung her head and just stood there. Meanwhile Jude unhooked the showerhead and used it in her hand to rinse Karen down again taking extra care with her groin. As she directed the high power jet of water against Karen's front it was almost too much and Karen had to bite her lip to stop herself from crying out loud. With Karen clean all over, Jude quickly washed herself&nbsp; before turning off the water and leading them out of the shower. As Karen stood dripping on the bath mat, Jude reached for two towels off the heated rail and passed one over.

Whilst Karen towelled off her shoulder length hair, she couldn't help but stare at Jude as she too dried herself. There was something about her self-confidence, the way she held herself, that hinted at her inner power and Karen felt enthralled. She had never felt like this before about anyone but all Jude had to do was ask and she would obey, grateful that she be allowed to do so. Jude caught her staring and gave her a little smile, a smile that made Karen's heart sing. She wondered what would happen next.

"You're getting horny, aren't you?" Jude asked with a smile. Karen could only blush in return. How could she reply, how could she explain that although her needs were physical as well as emotional, it felt cheap to dismiss them as simply 'horny'? Jude came over and stood in front of Karen reaching down with her hand to stroke the fuzz on Karen's mons.

"Yes, indeed, quite a horny little sub. You've been good so far but after that little exhibition in the shower it looks like we might have to do something to keep you under control. Wait here a minute." Jude put on a towelling dressing gown and left the bathroom. Moments later she returned, holding a couple of pink objects and something black and strappy in her hand. These she put down on the lid of the wash basket, before turning to the bathroom cabinet and rummaging inside. Karen stared at the pile trying to make out what it all was; the pink items consisted of a plain egg-like shape and what, from the switches on the front, looked like it might be a control unit. As for the black object, apart from the straps there was a plain black triangle and a black pole shaped attachment. Was it Karen's imagination or was the pole shaped like a man's thingy? Whilst Karen had been distracted, Jude had fetched out what looked like a large toothpaste tube. She took the top off and squeezed out some of the contents of the tube onto the forefinger of her right hand.

"Seeing as how you can't seem to control yourself it looks like we're going to have to give you a little help. Now bend over and put your hands on the side of the bath. That's right. Now spread your legs... wider. There, stay like that." 

As soon as Karen was suitably positioned she felt Jude come and stand next to her and then the shock of Jude's finger pushing once more against the puckered ring of her anus. The tube must have contained some sort of lubricant as Jude's finger felt cool and smooth as, after an initial resistance, it slipped in easily. Jude was able to ease it back and forth until Karen's entire back passage was nice and slippery. However this didn't last long; Jude removed her finger, went over to the basin and washed her hands. Then she went back to the wash basket and fetched the strappy contraption and this time Karen felt something much larger pushing against her. Now she realised just where the pole shape, the dildo part of the strappy object, was going to go.

"This will be a lot easier if you just relax," Jude urged, as she worked the tip of the dildo against Karen's sphincter. Karen wondered how on earth she was supposed to relax as, whilst the tip of Jude's finger had felt pleasurable, this was a very different matter. For a start it was considerably thicker and, even with the lubrication, it was going to be a tight fit. Indeed, at first Karen didn't think it was going to fit at all but, once it was past her sphincter, Jude was able to ease it in, centimetre by centimetre, and, just when Karen was wondering whether she could take any more, she felt the strapping nestle in between the cheeks of her buttocks.

Once the dildo was fully inserted Jude ordered Karen to stand up and face her. The strap that ran up behind her was looped around a belt, which Jude fitted around Karen's waist locking it in place with a small padlock.&nbsp; A long black triangle hung down from the front of the belt and this, in turn, could be connected to a strap that ran forward from the dildo so that it ended up like some bizarre thong made of a black rubbery material.

However, before fitting this final part of the jigsaw, Jude went back to the wash basket and returned with the egg shaped object. With a curt 'open wide' she eased open Karen's nether lips with one hand whilst offering up the egg shaped object with the other. This time there was no need for lubrication, Karen's constant state of arousal saw to that, and the egg slipped in easily. It would have slipped straight out again but, before it could do so, Jude took the bottom end of the triangle and pushed it back between Karen's legs and, after adjusting it so that it was a snug fit, she locked it in place with a second padlock. Now she was wearing it Karen could see how cleverly it had been made. The whole contraption could only be removed by undoing the padlock at the front but, by undoing the padlock between her legs, she could be exposed to answer calls of nature or for whatever games Jude might have in mind.

As Jude stood back up Karen got a glance of herself in the mirror. The chastity belt, for that was what it effectively was, covered her front in a broad triangle and, although, at a push, she might be able to squeeze her fingers underneath, it was made of a hard rubbery material and there was precious little give so she surely wouldn't be able to play with herself. Moreover it would certainly ensure that the dildo stayed firmly lodged in her backside and the pink object, whatever that was, would stay in her 'front bottom'.

"There, that's better, walk around a bit. Let's make sure it all fits comfortably," Jude ordered and Karen took a few tentative steps and, at Jude's bidding, bent forward to pick a towel off the floor. As she did so the strapping pulled painfully at the dildo in her backside and Karen realised that 'comfortable' was a relative word and she was going to have to move carefully from now on.

"There, that's perfect." Jude said, standing back with her head to one side. "That will keep temptation at bay."

As Karen had walked about she had found that it would do more than keep temptation at bay. The inside of the triangle was mostly smooth but the lower part was ridged in such a way as it separated her lower lips and, as she moved about, she was always gong to be aware of the way it rubbed directly against her most sensitive parts. Not only would the contraption deny her relief, it would also ensure that she was constantly kept on the edge of arousal. Furthermore there was no way she was going to forget that she had the dildo firmly inserted inside her anus. What did confuse her was whatever it was that Jude had inserted into her 'front bottom'. Whilst she could feel it was there and, with the chastity belt in place there was no way it was going anywhere else, it didn't do anything; it was neither arousing nor uncomfortable.

"We'd best sort out your hair. If we leave it to dry naturally it will look a mess and that will never do," Jude commented. "I've got a hairdryer somewhere; come along."

Jude led Karen back to the bedroom and sat her down at the dressing table. Gingerly Karen let herself down onto the chair feeling the dildo forced deeper inside her as she did so. As with bending over, this was another manoeuvre that the belt restricted. At first she put her hands in her lap but Jude told her brusquely to cross them behind her back. The hairdryer took some finding as Jude, with her short hair, would have had little use for it and it was seldom used. Whilst she waited, Karen looked around the dressing table. There was precious little feminine about what lay there; Jude definitely wasn't much of a one for make up, for example. At last Jude found the hairdryer at the bottom of a drawer, so she pulled it out, untangled the wiring and plugged it in. Again Karen wasn't allowed to do anything but sit there whilst Jude sorted her out. She found herself passing the time by clenching her buttocks and exploring the differing range of sensations that doing so produced from the dildo inside her. Whilst it was far from comfortable, there was something piquant about the full sensation it gave and Karen would have been hard pushed to say whether she liked it or not.

"Well, that's you sorted," Jude said at last. "The bathroom is a mess, the bed needs tidying and I want dinner on the table by seven so you had best get a move on. What do you say?"

"Yes, Mistress, thank you Mistress," Karen responded.

"See you later then," Jude said as she went off down stairs.

Seeing as how she was in the bedroom Karen started by tidying the bed. It really didn't need much, just straightening round where their acrobatics had ruffled the duvet. Karen noticed that both the headboard and tailboard were wrought iron and that, in addition to the cuffs that had been used to hold her in place earlier, there were others at the bottom corners, all of which were firmly and permanently anchored. The ones at the foot at the bed were discretely tucked away under the mattress, so Karen did the same with the others.

She was just finishing up when she felt a twinge 'down there'. It was as if... but surely... it was as if whatever Jude had pushed inside her had just moved of its own accord. Suddenly it did it again and this time for longer. The damn thing was vibrating in short random bursts. And then it dawned on her; there had been two pink objects; evidently the one that was inside her was a vibrator, one which worked on remote control, and the other part, the one currently in Jude's possession, must be the controller. Although Jude was not in the same room as she, Jude was still going to be able to control its movements. For thirty seconds or so Jude turned it on to full blast and Karen had to sit on the side of the bed with her hands clamped between her thighs as she rode the wave of sensations. However it wasn&#8217;t long before the vibrations returned to a lower setting, just enough to make sure there were now two items inside her she was constantly aware of.

As Karen moved on to the bathroom she was finding it hard to concentrate. Although Jude was downstairs she had not forgotten Karen and was constantly playing with the remote controller; in particular she would leave it on one setting for a while and then, just as Karen was getting used to the rhythm, Jude would once again play with the settings and Karen would have to get used to another one. At one point she even switched it off which was, in some way worse, as it left Karen on tenterhooks wondering how long she was going to have to wait and what setting it would be on when it started again. The final straw was when she was on her hands and knees sweeping up the pile of pubic hair left from where she had been shaven and a sudden burst of full power made her jerk and spill the lot again. In semi-despair she looked up and caught sight of herself in the mirror. With her mood shattered, she felt she looked ridiculous crawling about wearing nothing but this stupid chastity belt. What was she doing, what had he got herself involved with? Being ravished by Jude had been wild and exciting, being shaven and showered had been strangely erotic, being fitted with the chastity belt was sweet surrender but this, this endless teasing, was neither one thing nor another, and had gone far beyond pleasure and into the realms of the wearisome. It had completely destroyed any good mood or sexy feeling. Determined to see it through, she carried on with the cleaning but the more it went on the more it was getting to her. She was nearly in tears by the time the bathroom was finished and she went downstairs to find Jude, still in her dressing gown, with her feet up on the sofa reading a magazine in the front room.

"Please, Mistress," she said, uncertain as to what reaction she would get.

"What is it?" Jude said as she put down the magazine.

"Please, the vibrator thingy, please don't tease any more."

"What, like this?" Jude said taking the controller out of her pocket and turning the dial on the front up to full.

"Please, Jude, stop!" Karen cried out. She fell to her knees next to the sofa. "Please, Jude, we need to talk. When I agreed to come her I agreed to be your 'slave' and I still agree to that; I'll do anything you want, in bed or out of it, but this, this is just cruel." Karen had tears in her eyes. "Please, I want to play but please play nice."

"Are you telling me what I can or can't do? That's not your place, not your place at all. You're my property and I can do whatever I want to you. A Mistress is supposed to be cruel and you had best get used to it." Jude started to rebuke Karen for her outburst, but as soon as she started something about the look in Karen's eyes held her back. "OK, let's come out of role for a moment," she continued, her tone softer this time. "You knew when you agreed to this that I would be a harsh and now, now as soon it's got real, you're complaining about it."

"But... but... but there's playing at being cruel and really being cruel." Karen tried to explain herself. "You're supposed to be my friend, you're supposed to care about me, but what you're doing with that damn vibrator isn't turning me on, quite the contrary, it's giving me a headache and that's turning me right off. If only you would just leave it on one setting for a while...."

Jude had been quite taken aback by this. Was she supposed to be Karen's friend? Well, yes, but not at the moment, that was not what the weekend was all about. But, on the other hand, Karen was right, it was all a game, and as Karen was getting genuinely distressed.... Suddenly the game was far less simple. Still, now that it had come out in the open they might as well get it sorted.

"Hmm... is there anything else you're not happy with?" Jude asked, barely able to keep the sarcasm out of her voice.

"It's... Look, Jude, I know that being naked is all part and parcel of being your slave but can we turn the heating up a bit. It's all very for you, wrapped up in that lovely bathrobe but I'm freezing. It's really hard to feel cold and sexy at the same time."

For a long while Jude just looked at Karen as she knelt there before her. Sharon would never have complained like this; Sharon would never have dared but then, maybe that was what had gone so wrong for them. Maybe if Sharon had complained a bit then.... But then she was the Domme; part of her just wanted to just tell Karen to stop moaning and get on with it, to stop trying to top from the bottom. After all when Karen had agreed to spend the weekend she had agreed as to what the roles were; who was the Domme and who was just the slave but then, on the other hand, maybe Karen hadn't realised what she was letting herself in for. She was such a meek and mild little mouse that for her to speak out like this she must have reached the end of her tether. She did look cold and upset and Jude was not so insensitive to see that she wasn't having any fun. Her heart melted.

 "Here, I know what will warm you up." Jude said as she unfastened her dressing gown and lay full length on the sofa. "Come up here with me and give me a cuddle."

Karen got up on the sofa and lay down next to Jude and, as their bodies locked together, Jude realised just how cold Karen had been, it was like cuddling an ice cube. The bathrobe was a generous size and there was just enough of it to wrap around them both; Jude refastened the tie holding them together and gradually Karen began to warm up. 

It's probably a good job that Karen could not read Jude's thoughts at this point. Part of her was still quite angry; how dare this uppity little sub come and start laying down the rules? There were plenty of other girls down at the club and maybe Karen with her na�vet� was going to be more trouble than she was worth; maybe she should hold out for someone who knew how the game was played. But then, as the pair of them warmed up, so too her anger abated and she began to realise how unfair she was being. For Karen to be here at all must have taken a massive leap of faith; it must have take some real guts for her to put aside her obvious nervousness about what she was getting involved in. Maybe it was she, Jude, who was being unreasonable.

And besides, there was something more than that. At first it had been fun to rock this little mouse's world, to play with her, push her buttons and watch Karen squirm as she discovered just how far outside her comfort zone she had been led. Watching the tug-of-war between Karen's newly discovered appetites and her straight-laced vanilla background had been all part of the turn-on but, right here, right now, Jude didn't want to hurt her friend any more, rather she wanted to wrap her in her arms and protect her from everything bad in the world.

Karen too was calming down. As the warmth returned to her body, she began to remember just why she had allowed herself to be persuaded to be here. Part of her still wondered just what she was doing, just how she had been talked into finding herself in this bizarre situation, lying next to a naked woman, wearing only some sort of chastity belt with its dildo thingy stuck firmly up her bottom. Meanwhile the remote control vibrator purred away singing its song, gently re-stoking the fires within. Crazy or not, now that Jude had stopped mucking with the controls it was rather nice. She snuggled closer to Jude. Heaven knew how she would have explained this to her mother, let alone her father, but, for all that it was 'unnatural', there was something about Jude that made her feel alive for the first time in her life. It wasn't just the intensity of the sex and the earth shattering orgasms, although, heaven knows that would have been enough, there was something else about the way Jude made her feel, something about being in her arms, something that made this all feel right.

Jude shifted slightly and gently kissed Karen's ear lobe. From there it seemed only natural for Karen to turn her head until they were lip-to-lip, exchanging soft gentle kisses.

"I suppose..." kiss. "...you realise..." kiss "...that as your cruel Mistress"..." kiss "...I have a bounden duty to..." kiss "...smack that pretty little behind of yours."

"Yes, Mistress. I'm sorry I spoke out, Mistress," Karen replied.

"You will be. In the meanwhile I'm getting hungry.&nbsp; If you go and look in the kitchen you'll find some spuds in the veg rack. Why don't you start by peeling enough for dinner?"

Somewhat reluctantly Karen got up from the warmth of their cocoon. She could quite happily have lain there all night but, now that Jude had mentioned it, she was quite hungry and time was passing. Once on her feet she turned to Jude and gave a little curtsey.

"Of course, Mistress." She said with a twinkle in her eye. "Anything you say, Mistress."

Karen went and found the kitchen. As Jude had said there were some potatoes in the veg rack and she soon found the peeler and was settling down at the kitchen sink when Jude reappeared.

"Here, you had best wear this." Jude said, handing over a bathrobe. "We'll need to get something more suitable sorted out for next time but it will keep you warm for now."

"Thank you, Mistress," Karen said gratefully as she put it on. Suddenly their little squabble seemed so unnecessary and, as she went back to the sink, Karen felt like she belonged. Cooking for someone, caring for someone, that what she was meant to do. All those years looking after her parents had trained her into the dutiful daughter and now she was settling into the role of the dutiful... &#8216;slave&#8217; seemed somehow the wrong word... servant, submissive, they all missed the love with which she was caring for her... her what? again the word didn't come easy. &#8216;Mistress&#8217; missed the point. For all that they were playing at being Mistress and slave, there was an undercurrent of something far more caring and it just felt natural for Karen to tend to Jude's needs, to have her relax with a cup of tea as Karen bustled about preparing the meal, laying the table and generally getting on with things. 

And, as for the gentle hum of the vibrator and the full feeling from her behind, well that was all part and parcel or the unreality, all part of the ever-growing ball of sexual tension that was the background of her time with Jude. For all that there were unresolved issues, Karen felt a level of contentment that had been missing for so long from her life.

Karen wasn't the only one feeling content. Jude, as she sat back and watched Karen do the cooking, was also feeling pleasantly satisfied with life. There was something very domestic about the way that Karen was bustling about the kitchen; she felt that all she needed was a pipe and slippers to be part of some fifties sitcom. But if Karen would make a good wife, what did that make her, a good husband? She was still pondering what all this meant when Karen called her to the table as the meal was ready.

Karen had only laid the table for one; whilst she had been cooking she found herself getting deeper and deeper into the role and she was sure that a 'sub' would never eat at the same table as her Mistress. Indeed, as she cooked the meal she only cooked for one; she reckoned she'd grab a sandwich later. She plated up the pie and chips and placed it on the table before pulling back the chair and motioning Jude to sit.

"May I fetch Mistress a drink?" Karen asked.

"Certainly. There's beer in the fridge." 

Karen fetched a glass and looked in the fridge where there were a number of cans of Becks lager. She opened on and rather inexpertly poured it out.

"And what is my little sub going to eat?" Jude asked.

"I... I wasn't sure what you wanted me to do, Mistress." 

"So you didn't cook anything?"

"No, Mistress."

"Hmm... That's not good. Come and kneel down here next to me." Jude pointed to the floor next to where she was sat. 

Karen did as she was told and Jude reached down and tousled her hair, guiding Karen's head onto her lap.

"You are a silly-billy," Jude chided. "We can't have you going without your evening meal, how can you serve me properly when you're fainting away with hunger. It's a good job you've made me enough for two. Now, open wide."

Karen looked up to see that Jude was reaching down with a chip on the end of her fork. She opened her mouth as directed and Jude popped the chip inside. Jude didn't just restrict the meal to chips either, but also included a forkfuls of pie. Karen couldn't help but feel like a puppy being fed scraps from the table but, given her still rather confused emotions, this was fine.

Jude also noted the puppy aspect, and sighed to herself internally. There were obviously quite a few things they were going to have to sort out; a 'slave' should look after her Mistress, not the other way around. But who could resist those puppy-dog eyes looking up at her with such trust? She reached for another chip, dipped it in brown sauce and offered it down. She thought over going to the club later. That in itself wouldn't be pretty intense but afterwards.... Would that be pushing Karen too far too fast, would that be betraying this trust? 

Dammit, the girl was just a sub and would have to learn to take what was coming to her. If she couldn't handle the heat then she should never have come into the kitchen.

"Are you my good little puppy dog now?" Jude asked playfully.

"Woof," was Karen's only reply.










"We had best be getting on," Jude said, as she put down her knife and fork and pushed her chair back from the table. "We want to be at the club by eight o'clock, and there's the washing up to be done as well as getting dressed. Hurry along now."

Karen got up from where she was kneeling ,and cleared the dishes away to the sink. She filled the bowl with hot soapy water, and was beavering away when Jude came up behind her and wrapped her arms about her. She tucked her hands inside the opening of Karen's dressing gown and sought out her breasts.

"And is slave 'k' a little happier now?" she asked, as her fingers tweaked Karen's nipples.

"Yes, thank you, Mistress," Karen replied.

Jude continued to play with Karen's nipples, and it was getting hard for Karen to concentrate. Jude pinched them quite hard and, as they now seemed to be sending little shafts of electricity directly to her groin,, Karen couldn't help but lean back into Jude and purr with pleasure, the washing up completely forgotten.

"Did I say you could stop?" Jude demanded.

"No. No, Mistress," Karen replied.

"Well, get on with it then," Jude ordered.

Struggling to keep her focus, Karen continued with the dishes. Fortunately for her there wasn't much left, and it wasn't long before she had finished. As soon as she put the last saucepan down, Jude spun her around and kissed her hard on the mouth. Their respective dressing gowns fell open and they hung, pressed together.

"If we didn't have to go out...," Jude commented as she broke away from the kiss.

"Do we have to?" Karen enquired, hoping that, perhaps, they could go to bed and sort out the growing itch between her thighs.

"Yes, we do," Jude replied firmly. "I promised the others we'd be there and, anyway, it's all part of your continuing education."

"What others?"&nbsp; Karen asked. 

"Just the usual crowd. You'll see when we get there and, if we don't get a move on, we never will get there. Now, come along, we've wasted enough time as it is."

Jude led them upstairs to her bedroom. She told Karen to take off the bathrobe and hang it on the back of the door. Then she reached into her wardrobe and fetched out a carrier bag. 

"Here, I got this lot for you to wear. I think I got the right sizes," she said as she handed it over.

Karen opened up the carrier bag and looked inside. At the top was what at first just appeared to be a shapeless piece of material but, as she unfolded it, she saw that it was effectively a tube of Lycra. If it weren't for the label sewn in the back, it would be impossible to tell how it was supposed to go. Jude helped her into it and, once she had got herself sorted out, she found that it was a skin tight fit from just above her bust to mid thigh. Although she was, in the strict sense of the word, decently dressed, the way the outline of her nipples was clearly visible through the stretchy material did nothing to hide the fact that she wasn't wearing a bra and, below, she had a most appalling case of visible panty line where the outline of the chastity belt was clearly discernible through the taut material. Karen thought it might, just, have been suitable for a youngster down at the clubs around town but for her... it was outrageous!

"Perfect!" enthused Jude. "Now there are stockings and shoes in there as well. Come along, I want to see what you look like."

The stockings turned out to be thigh-high hold-ups, whose lacy tops barely reached the hem of her dress. They were black and very sheer but at least they weren't fishnets. The shoes were stiletto-heeled court shoes. Although the heels weren't much over three inches, Karen had never been much of a one for heels. These were higher than anything she had ever worn before. She put them on, found that they were a perfect fit and, tottering slightly, she stood up. 

She gasped when she saw herself in Jude's full-length mirror. She looked such a wanton slut! She looked like one of the girls down on Dock Road, the heart of the red-light district. Her whole outfit screamed that she was sexually available. Maybe, just maybe, on a teenager out clubbing, this might have looked appropriate but she felt like mutton dressed as lamb. She hoisted up the front so that it better covered her breasts.

"How are the shoes? Can you walk in them?" Jude asked.

"They're... I can manage, just," Karen replied. "Please, Jude... err... Mistress. Do I really have to go out like this?"

"Yes you do. You look great, just like a sexy femme sub ought to look. And I've had just about enough back-chat from you. Any more and you'll be going out wearing a gag. Do I make myself quite clear?"

"Yes, Mistress. Of course, Mistress." Karen wasn't sure whether Jude's threat was real or bluff, but there was no way she was going to put it to the test.

"Fine, you can sit at the dressing table and do your makeup whilst I get dressed. Maybe that will keep you quiet."

Karen looked at the dressing table, to find that her cosmetics bag from her overnight case was lying next to the mirror. Jude must have put it there when she was sorting out the bathrobe. Karen wasn't quite sure how she felt about Jude going through her things, but knew better than to argue the toss over this one. She sat down and set to work.

In fact Karen hadn't got much to do. A little light blusher, some eye liner and a bit of lippy were all she was used to, but she wanted to look her best so she took extra care and, as she did so, she watched Jude in the mirror.

There could be no clearer indication of the difference in role between the two women than the clothes that they were putting on. Karen used the mirror to watch discreetly as Jude put on a pair of white cotton boxer shorts, a crisp white shirt, dark tan slacks, ankle socks and brown brogue shoes. Although the clothing could not have been more masculine, the end result was androgynous and Karen couldn't help but stare. There was something about Jude that made her want to stare. Beautiful, sure but not in the conventional sense of the word; handsome, but that made Jude sound too masculine and, despite the clothing, Jude was certainly not a girl dressed as a boy. What thrilled was this sense of power, this strong, independent woman could dress how she liked and always look great. That sent a thrill through her that made Karen's heart melt. With Jude looking so fabulous, how could she do other than worship her?

"So you like what you see?" Jude had caught Karen staring at her in the mirror.

"Yes, Mistress. You look," Karen still couldn't find the words, "just right."

"How are you getting on? Finished?" Jude asked and Karen nodded in reply. "Well, I've got one more thing to complete your outfit."

Jude went to her bedside table and returned with a long thin jewellery case. She came and stood behind Karen and opened it up,&nbsp; revealing a heavy gold chain maybe eighteen inches long. The fastener was a small padlock, and at the mid point a gold identity tag hung down. She placed it around Karen's neck and clicked the padlock shut. Karen leaned forward and looked at herself in the mirror. The chain was so short that it was more of a choker than a necklace. She looked closer and was not in the slightest bit surprised to see that the ID disk had an ornate 'k' engraved on it. She turned the disk over and there, on the back, were the words, 'Property of Jude'.

"Jude... err... Mistress, you shouldn't have," Karen gasped. Surely a gold chain like this must have cost a fortune.

"Shh... I'll spend my money how I like, thank you," Jude replied gruffly. "It's not a collar, we haven't got to that bit yet, but it will do for wearing out. Let everyone know whose property you are."

Karen had been so taken by the luxury of the necklace that she had hardly considered what it implied. It was like one of those pictures which can be seen two ways; one moment she was looking a beautiful necklace that any woman would be proud to wear, the next at an obvious collar, locked around her and with her 'slave' title plain for all to see. She guessed, she hoped, that this was the point. Those that knew the symbolism would spot it right away; others would simply see the necklace.

"Thank you, Mistress. It's beautiful," Karen said, still fingering the links.

"Nothing but the best for my girl," Jude replied. "Now, if you are ready, I'll order the cab."

Jude rang for a taxi and, in the meanwhile, Karen practiced walking back and forth, trying to get used to the heels. Five minutes later Jude was guiding her by the elbow, as she tottered down the front path towards the waiting taxi. It was only when she actually tried to get in that Karen discovered just how troublesome the dress was going to be. The taxi was a London cab model and stepping up into it made her dress ride up until she was sure that the chastity belt was clearly visible. As quickly as she could, she settled into her seat and tried to pull the dress back down again. Even so, she caught the eye of the cabbie, who was watching her in his rear view mirror.

"Where to, love?" the cabbie asked.

"Top end of Fishergate, please. Just by Yate's Wine Lodge," Jude replied and off they went.

Now that they were out of the house, Karen was getting increasingly nervous. The dress seemed to have a mind of its own and she was endlessly having to pull the hem down or pull the bust up so as to retain some modesty. As she reached for her hem once again, Jude smacked the back of her hand and told her to stop fidgeting. Karen gave her a pleading look but to no avail. She had to console herself that if the cabbie did get an eyeful, then all he would see was the black triangular bit of the chastity belt, which would just look like normal panties from where he was sat.

The top end of Fishergate is pretty busy on a Friday evening as all the clubbers meet up in the various pubs and bars. Karen was left standing alone whilst Jude paid off the taxi. A group of lads came out from Yate's and, seeing Karen standing there, they gathered around her.

"'Ello, gorgeous. Where are you off to tonight?" one of the lads started.

"I'm with somebody," Karen replied. 

"Yeah, but he ain't here now, is he," the lad continued. "How's about coming with us? We'll look after you."

"And how's about you leave the girl alone," Jude had paid off the cab and came up to Karen and put a protective arm around her.

"Gor, look at the state of that," the lad continued, evidently emboldened by drink. "What are you, some kind of lezzy or something?"

"I'm your worst nightmare," Jude replied. "A lezzy and a cop. Understand? Now back off."

"Yes, miss. Sorry to have disturbed you, miss. Didn't mean any offence, just mucking about." The lad, realising just how far he was in over his head, back-pedalled desperately and, as quick as they had arrived, the lads dispersed.

"Always one, isn't there?" Jude laughed until she looked at Karen and saw how shaken she was. "Hey, it's OK, they were just some lads having fun, no harm done and I'm here to look after you."

"Thank you, Mistress," Karen replied and snuggled a little closer under Jude's arm.

They made their way down one of the alleyways that lead off Fishergate and were soon at the club. Karen noticed that this time the door was not locked and Jude just let them in, although she was careful to close the door behind them. Apparently there was no need for a doorkeeper apart from D/s nights. They made their way into the body of the club, which was filling up fast. Karen noticed Mistress Wanda, who tonight, she guessed, would just be Wanda, sitting at the bar; indeed she looked up to see who had entered and she and Jude exchanged hellos. Jude looked around and spotted what she was looking for.

"There they are," she said and, taking Karen once again by the elbow, led her across the room. As they arrived at the booth, Karen was pleased to see Mel and Lucy sitting there already, along with two others she vaguely remembered from the previous week.

"Hi girls," Jude said brightly. "Mel and Lucy, you've already met 'k', Sarah, Kathy, you may remember she was here last week."

Mel and Lucy greeted Karen as a long lost friend, and Sarah and Kathy were equally welcoming. There was a certain amount of shuffling about as Jude went to sit down but when Karen tried to follow she was told in no uncertain terms that it was her job to go and get the drinks.

"Here's a tenner, that will do to start with." Jude reached into her jacket pocket and pulled out her wallet. "I'll have a Beck's, get whatever you like for yourself."

"Yes, Mistress," Karen replied and set off across the room to the bar. She was still unused to walking in the high heels but she could well see how, along with the dress, they affected her posture. She was forced to take smaller steps and to swing her hips, if only the damn dress wouldn't keep riding up.&nbsp; She got to the bar and ordered Jude a bottle of Beck's and a glass of lemonade for herself. Whilst she was waiting for her change, Wanda came over to her.

"Hello. Aren't you the little sub that ran away last week?" she said with a smile.

"Err... Hello... Sorry, I didn't mean to make an exhibition of myself," Karen replied, horrified that this was the way in which she was remembered.

"Oh, I wouldn't worry about that. You weren't the first and you won't be the last. I see you're here with Jude this time," Wanda reached up for the ID tag that hung from Karen's necklace, "or would that be Mistress Jude?" 

"Yes, Mistress, it's Mistress Jude tonight." It seemed there was nothing hidden from this woman and, even though it was not a D/s night, it still seemed appropriate to call her Mistress.

"Well, you had best be getting back or you'll get that pretty little backside of yours smacked. I wouldn't want to get you into trouble, well, not too much trouble," Wanda laughed.

"Yes, Mistress." 

"I'm not your Mistress." This seemed to amuse Wanda even more. "Just Wanda will do, but if Jude ever gets bored with you, well, come and see me. Now, off you go, mustn't keep Mistress Jude waiting."

Blushing bright red, Karen returned to the booth with the drinks. Whilst she had been gone the group had been joined by another couple, who Jude introduced as Andy and Beth. Karen said hello and then Beth was sent to get the drinks for Andy and herself.

And then, just like last time, it was all suddenly very normal. The women had obviously been friends for some while and were pretty close. The chat wandered far and wide and was just about normal for a girls' night out. However, beneath this normality there was a definite undercurrent. Karen soon found out that all the couples enjoyed a D/s lifestyle. Whilst it was far from as obvious as it had been last time, it was easy to see that each couple consisted of a Domme and a sub and, although it was subtle, Karen, Lucy, Kathy and Beth were definitely the junior partners. As the evening went on the hints, the allusions, became more blatant and Karen was glad they were in a secluded booth in a private club.

As they chatted, she got to know a little more about the others. Sarah worked in a shop in town whilst, Kathy, her sub, was some sort of accountant. Karen guessed that they were both in their low thirties. Andy, Karen guessed that it was something like Andrea on her birth certificate, worked at the hospital as a phlebotomist, which apparently had something to do with blood samples. Beth, it turned out, was a surgeon specialising in paediatrics. Andy and Beth had been together for nigh on fifteen years. "I met her when she was straight out of medical school, the rawest little houseman in the place," Andy commented. "She was useless at taking blood, never could find the vein, still can't that matter." Karen did the maths and worked out that they both must be around forty although you wouldn't guess it with either of them.

After a while Karen was beginning to regret choosing lemonade as her drink for each round although, truth be told, she would have had the same problem whatever she had been drinking. At first the need to pee started as a slight twinge but it wasn't going away. Before long the need was urgent. It seemed to take forever as Karen waited for a suitable pause in the conversation.

"Please, Mistress Jude, I need to go," she whispered urgently.

"Need to go, where do you need to go?" asked Jude, deliberately misunderstanding.

"To the toilets. I need to pee," Karen hissed.

"No, I don't think so. Maybe later."

"Mistress! I'm bursting!"&nbsp; 

"Well, you'll just have to hold it."

"I can't. Please, I'll wet myself."

With a sigh, Jude took some keys out of her pocket and tossed them onto the table.

"Ladies, it seems that my sub needs the toilet but she's all locked up and I can't be arsed. Should I let her have the keys?"

Karen was truly shocked. It was bad enough having to wear the chastity belt but to have it revealed in this cavalier fashion, to have the full extent of Jude's control over her announced blatantly like this, was almost past bearing. She clasped her hands between her knees and hung her head in shame.

"By the looks of things you're going to have to let her go or we'll get another cleaning bill from Wanda," Andy cut in. "It was bad enough last time but if we have another sub peeing all over the seats Wanda will go spare. If you don't want to go, then have one of the other subs take her.

Karen was amazed that she should be left to wet herself was even being considered. She wondered what had happened 'last time' and decided she didn't want to know.

"Please, Mistress," Lucy spoke up. "I'll take her. I don't mind."

"Mel?" Jude enquired.

"Yeah, let her go. As Andy says, we'll be in deep goo with Wanda if she pees herself."

"Ok then." Jude passed the keys to Lucy and pointed out which one unlocked the padlock between her thighs. "She's not to touch herself," Jude added. "Hands behind her neck at all times. Oh, and she's got a vibrator inside her as well. Make sure that stays in place."

"Of course, Mistress." Lucy replied. She picked up the keys and held out her hand to Karen who meekly followed her across the club. This time walking really was difficult, as Karen needed to keep her thighs together to stop from peeing herself. Lucy led her into the ladies and chose an empty stall. Karen immediately pulled her dress up to around her waist but Lucy stopped her with a stern tutting.

"You heard Mistress Jude. You're not to touch yourself. Now clasp your hands behind your neck like a good girl."

"Please, Lucy," Karen was near to panic but she did as she was told and even stood with her legs apart to make it easier for Lucy to find the lock.

"Now which key was it?" Lucy mused.

"For Pete's sake I'm bursting," Karen pleaded. "Please, Lucy, stop messing about."

"OK, OK, keep you hair on." Lucy found the relevant key and fumbled between Karen's thighs to find the padlock. It seemed to take ages but eventually it was opened and the triangular flap at the front of the chastity belt was freed. Karen almost fell back down onto the toilet seat and, with Lucy holding the flap clear, she was finally able to relieve herself. As she started to relax, the vibrator started to slip out, but Lucy was ready for this. She reached out with her free hand and pushed it back in. Of course this resulted in a certain amount of splashing, but Karen was just glad to finally empty her bladder. At last the torrent reduced to a trickle, and then died away all together. Karen slumped forward and leant her head on her friend's shoulder.

"Looks like you needed that." 

"Did I ever," Karen replied. "Thanks, thanks for coming with me. It looked like the others were going to make me wet myself."

"Nah, they were just mucking about. Now if we'd been in the playroom...."

"Playroom?" queried Karen. "What's that?"

"You mean Jude hasn't shown you? Then it's not my place to say any more. Now let's get you dried off."

With one hand still holding the flap of the chastity belt out of the way, Lucy withdrew the other hand and, to Karen's horror, licked her fingers.

"Lucy! Ugh! That's disgusting!"

"What, you've never tasted pee before?" Lucy laughed. "If you stay with Jude you soon will."

"But that's... unhygienic," Karen protested.

"Actually it's not," Lucy replied as she reached for the toilet paper. "Fresh urine is sterile unless the donor has some sort of infection. Do you have some sort of infection?"

"No, of course not!" 

"Well there you go then. After that it's just a matter of taste. Now come along, let's get you buttoned up again before that damn vibrator slips out."

Lucy refastened the chastity belt and flushed the toilet. Then the two women left the stall and went over to the basins to wash their hands.

"So, how's it going with Jude?" Lucy asked.

"I don't know, Lucy, all this kinky stuff. I mean... I'm not sure about it all."

"You're not sure about it all but still you're out in public dressed like a slut, wearing a chastity belt and with a remote control vibrator inside you? Jude must be pretty persuasive." 

"That's what I mean," Karen replied. "When I'm with her I just melt, I'll do anything she says and then, before I know it, here I am. It's pretty scary and part of me wants to run away."

"So why don't you? Leave, I mean. It's not as if you can't. After all, she must have given you a safe word. All you have to do is say it and she'll let you go."

"Look, Lucy," Karen turned to her friend with tears in her eyes, "I'm twenty nine and, until last week, I'd never been kissed. And then this amazing woman walks into my life and turns it all upside down. She's kind, she's generous, she's smart, she's sexy and when we're not playing sex games we can talk for hours; nobody has ever understood me the way she does. There's just one thing wrong, she's into kinky sex and I'm worried that if I don't play along I'll lose her."

"And you're not into the kinky sex?" Lucy probed. "That's not the impression you gave the other night."

"That's the hard part. I feel like I ought not to be; I mean the very thought of sleeping with another woman is a bit too much to handle and as for the other stuff... but, when I stop being such a prude, well...."

Lucy just gave Karen an understanding smile.

"It's just that it's all a bit overwhelming," Karen continued. "I look in the mirror and wonder if this is really me. Suddenly I find out that my new best friend likes drinking pee. How am I supposed to cope with that?"

"Just accept it for what it is," Lucy replied. "After all, it's not as if we're hurting anybody. We're just some girls having fun."

"When you put it like that I feel so foolish," Karen confessed. "And I really don't want to be a wet blanket."

"Has Jude told you what we like to do after we leave the club?" Lucy asked, her voice full of concern.

"No, what? What should I know about?"

"Well, if Jude hasn't told you then I guess she wants it to be a surprise. It's just... well, look, it's a lot of fun but... you might be a little shocked."

"Will I have to drink pee?"

"You'll have to wait and see, won't you." Lucy said with a smile on her face.

"Will you be there?"

"Of course, that's the point. Now come along, the others must be wondering where we've got to." And with that Lucy smoothed down Karen's dress before leading her back into the club and across to the booth where the rest of the party were waiting for them.

"Where the fuck have you been?" Jude started. "You two took your time. We thought you'd run off together or something."

"I'm sorry, Mistress Jude," Lucy replied for them both. "slave 'k' and I had a few things to discuss, a few details that needed sorting out. Here's the keys, she's all locked up again, safe and sound."

"And did she play with herself?" Jude turned to Karen "Well, did you?"

"No, Mistress," Karen replied, quite shocked.

"Hmm... OK then. Now go and fetch another round of drinks. My glass is empty."

And with that the party returned to normal. Karen tried to relax but the hints that Lucy had dropped in the toilets were bothering her. What and where was the 'playroom' and what as going to happen after the club? Was the fact that Lucy, and by implication all the others, were going to be there a good thing or a bad thing? Whilst no one was exactly drunk, everyone apart from Karen had had several drinks and Karen could see that their inhibitions were being loosened. Should she be scared? Lucy didn't seem to think so but she had tried to warn her of something.

"Hi guys." 

Karen looked up to see that a woman of about her age had just approached the booth. Karen had been lost in thought and sunk back in the booth so maybe the woman didn't notice her but she went straight over to Jude and stood in front of her.

"Hey Mistress Jude. Are we playing tonight?" She asked as she sidled up to her coyly. Evidently this woman hadn't made the connection between Jude and Karen.

"Frankie. Good to see you." Jude replied, somewhat awkwardly. "Let me introduce you to slave 'k', she's my sub tonight."

Frankie turned and looked. If looks could kill, Karen would have been reduced to a pile of ashes, so strong was the disdain in her eyes.

"Well, well, well. Look at little miss mousy. So, does that mean I'm not good enough for you anymore? Bored with me and you want to move on?" Frankie sneered. "I can't see why on earth you would choose this one, though. What's she got that I couldn't give you? Looks a bit uptight to enjoy your sort of games."

"Hey, come on, you know it's not like that," Jude protested. "There was never anything special between us; we were just playmates, a series of one night stands. It was never anything more than that. We both knew that right from the start."

"If I didn't then it sure looks like I do now." Frankie's anger was evident. "And is she just another one night stand or have you found true love at last?"

"Frankie, enough," Jude snapped.

"Frankie, fuck off. Is that what you mean?" Frankie snarled. She turned to Karen. "You, mousy, you'd better take care. One moment it's all fun and games and the next moment you're being treated like a wet fart. Well, I know when I'm not wanted. Fuck off the lot of you." And with that she was gone.

"Who was that?" Karen asked.

"Just an old friend." 

"She seemed to think she was more than that."

"She seemed to think all sorts of things," Jude replied. "She was never more than a friend. Trust me.'"

And with that the subject was dropped, but Karen couldn't shift it from her mind. Of course she knew that she wasn't Jude's first and, of course, it was only logical that everyone would know everyone in a small, enclosed community like the local lesbian scene, but something about Frankie worried her. And then there was the trust issue. The more time she spent with Jude the more she found out that Jude liked some pretty wild games. What sort of things had she indulged in with Frankie? Would she expect her to be that wild, that uninhibited? And, if Karen didn't play along, if she was too boringly prudish, would she also become 'just an old friend'. Was Jude just in it for the sex or was there something more? She sat quietly as she pondered these thoughts.

"Hey guys, I've had enough of here. Let's head on back," Sarah said thirty minutes or so later.

"Good idea. My place?" Jude suggested.

"Yeah, your place," Andy replied. "I'll order a minibus. Drink up everyone."

Andy phoned for a minibus whilst they all drained their glasses and went out to the street to wait. It wasn't long before it arrived and they all piled inside. As they made their way back to Jude's house, Karen could tell that there was a tension in the air, that whatever they were going back to was something they were all looking forward to. She remembered Lucy's hints and wondered what was coming next.









When the minibus pulled up outside Jude's house, Andy reached forward to pay off the driver whilst the others tumbled out and made their way up to the front door. Karen found that Jude was holding her close and being very protective; she had one arm around Karen's shoulder as she fumbled in her pockets, found her key ring and turned the lock on the front door.

"Go on through to the playroom, everyone." Jude said as soon as they entered. "slave 'k', I want you to organise the drinks. slave Beth, you had best help her."

"Yes, Mistress," Beth answered smartly, but Karen was non-plussed by what was being demanded of her. It wasn't as if she minded being ordered to play at hostess, but if she were to organise the drinks then how was she to know what everyone wanted and how was she to know where everything was? However, Beth caught her eye and motioned with her head towards the kitchen and, gratefully, Karen followed. 

They all trooped down the hallway but, before they got to the kitchen, Sarah, who was leading, opened a door off to the left and went through. As she went past on her way to the kitchen, Karen glanced through the door but only saw that it led down into the cellar. What was down there was anyone's guess.

"Give me a hand here, will you?" Beth asked, turning her back on Karen as soon as they had entered the kitchen.

"A hand?" Karen asked, completely confused. Beth was standing still as if she expected Karen to understand what was required.

"Please, with my zipper."

"With your zipper, what's up with your zipper?" Karen was still totally lost.

"Will you pull it down for me, silly?" And then it dawned on her why Karen was looking so lost.

"Sorry, 'k'," Beth turned back to face Karen. "I didn't mean to call you silly. I guess I assumed you knew all about the no clothes in the house rule."

"No clothes in the house.... Is that going to apply to me as well?" Karen could feel the panic building up inside her.

"Will it apply to you? Well you are a sub so I can't see why not. You can try keeping them on if you want but you'll end up being punished." Beth smiled. "I certainly wouldn't recommend it. Talking of being punished we'd best get a move on. Would you please...?" 

Again Beth turned her back on Karen who, this time, reached tentatively for the zipper that ran down the back of Beth's dress and pulled it down to her waist. Beth then shrugged the dress off her shoulders, let it fall forward and stepped out of it. Karen was not in the slightest bit surprised to see that she was wearing neither bra nor panties and was now naked, apart from her high-heeled ankle boots. Beth folded her dress neatly and laid it over the back of a chair.

"Come along, your turn," she said.

"I... I... I can't." Now that she realised what she had got herself into, Karen was horrified at the implications. She backed away from Beth until she was up against the kitchen work surface and could go no farther. All the hints that Lucy had been dropping suddenly made sense. It seemed that Jude had arranged some sort of orgy and she had a stark choice: she could join in or she could run away. Were she to undress, then implicit in her nakedness would be her availability for anything else they chose to do. She could see how na&#239;ve she had been; she had only to remember how the subs had been treated back at the club last week to understand what was in store for her. Compliance in undressing implied at least partial, if not full, compliance in everything else, and this was a step she wasn't prepared for.

"Wow, Mistress Jude really has thrown you in at the deep end, hasn't she?" Beth said kindly as she witnessed the rising panic in Karen's eyes. "If it makes it any easier you'll find that Lucy and Kathy will be naked by now as well. You and I won't be the only ones."

Karen realised she'd come to a crisis point. Frankie's jeers came back to haunt her, how she had been called 'mousy' and 'uptight'. Compared with the others she probably was. Could she fit in amongst these women; more to the point, did she want to?

And then there was Beth standing naked and unashamed, as if it were all completely normal. Karen couldn't help but stare at her. Both her nipples were pierced and, not only was she completely shaven 'down there', she had another piercing in her 'front bottom', and the lips had been padlocked together. Karen wondered how much it must have hurt to have piercings in such intimate places and how embarrassing it must have been to have them done. Just a short while ago, back in the club Beth had seemed so nice, so normal and now....

"Are you OK?" Beth asked, her voice full of concern.

"I'm..." Karen looked at Beth, her eyes full of tears. "I'm...."

"You're scared witless, that's what you are, aren't you?" Beth said gently. "Look, I can see that this is all too much for you.&nbsp; Jude has pushed you too far, too fast. I'll go and tell her that you're not up to playing tonight."

"Would you? Would you really?" Karen grasped at this straw but her relief was short lived for, as soon as Beth turned towards the door, Karen felt the waves of panic coming back. As Beth turned away from her she saw in her mind's eye all her new found friends also turning away from her, turning away from this uptight little mouse who wouldn't play in their games. Whilst she was struggling to come to terms with the contrast between the friendly welcoming people she had met earlier and the orgy they now expected her to join, what was the alternative? She could run away, go home defeated, spend another night on her own, abandon the first real relationship she had ever had. She wasn't sure she could take that either.

"Beth, please, don't go."

Beth turned in the doorway.

"Beth, please, just give me a minute or two."

"OK, sweetie, take your time," Beth came back into the kitchen but she was careful not to get too close to Karen, realising that she still needed her space.

"Guys! What's the hold up?" Kathy arrived at the door. Like Beth she was naked except for her shoes, ankle socks and a collar. "The bosses are getting restless."

"Just ask them to give us a minute, will you?" Beth replied. "We have a slight case of beginner's nerves."

"No, it's OK. I'll do it," Karen said, an edge of determination in her voice. Somehow seeing the two women together had changed things, had made it more normal. Suddenly she was the odd one out by being dressed. Her modesty, her prudishness, were overturned by a desire to fit in, a desire not to be alone any more. That said, she still had to turn away from them as she gathered up her courage and rolled her dress first down to her waist, and then all the way down until she was stepping out of the coil of rolled up cloth that it had become. She bent down to pick it up and, as she stood back up again she realised it was now or never so she turned back to face the others.

"So, what are these drinks we're supposed to fetch?" She said forcing herself to sound as casual as she could whilst she unrolled the dress and draped it over the back of a chair.

"There should be some white wine in the fridge, and a couple of beers for Mistress Jude and Mistress Andy. I'll get the tray and the glasses," Beth said briskly, realising how fragile Karen's determination was. "Kathy, be a dear and tell the bosses there's been a teensy problem but it's all right now. We'll be there in a moment or two."

"OK, will do," Kathy said, before disappearing back to the playroom.

As soon as she was gone, Beth came over to Karen and gave her a little hug.

"Well done, that took real guts, I could tell," she said softly.

"Thank you," Karen replied. "Thank you for being so patient."

"No problem, but we really must get on with these drinks." Beth had found the tray and glasses and put them on the kitchen table. Karen found the wine, and then rummaged in the knife drawer to find a corkscrew, whilst Beth opened the beers and poured them out. Now they were working together, it seemed no time before they were done.

"It was you who was ordered to get the drinks, so it had best be you who takes the tray," Beth said. "Are you ready?"

"Yes, I'm ready," Karen replied, although the hundred and one butterflies in her stomach said otherwise.

"OK, let's go."

Karen picked up the tray and Beth held the door for her. As they went down the hallway towards the playroom, Karen caught sight of herself in the mirror that hung by the front door. The shoes and stockings that she still wore, along with the chastity belt covering her groin, emphasised her lack of any other clothing and her breasts, visible over the tray that she held, seemed to be as much part of the offering as the drinks. At the doorway she nearly had another crisis but, steeling herself, she allowed Beth to open it for her and they walked on through.

Karen had her work cut out simply keeping her balance and not spilling the drinks as she struggled with her high heels and the steep steps down into what had been the cellar, now evidently the playroom. It was only when she got to the bottom she was able to look about her.

The bathroom wasn't the only room in the house where Jude had spent her aunt's legacy. Karen thought of cellars as cold, dark and damp; this was anything but. It consisted of two large rooms, which reprised the lounge and the kitchen above. The wall between these rooms had been knocked away in several places, and replaced by stout pillars and rolled steel joists to take the load.

The room immediately at the bottom of the stairs was the larger of the two and had been decorated with a certain luxury. The main theme was a deep red with gold trimmings. The floor was carpeted and the walls covered with cloth hangings to cover the bare brick beneath. The lighting was indirect and discreet and, Karen noticed, there was a gas fire built in to one of the walls. The fire had been lit and was warming up the room nicely. At one end, there were four opulent chairs, thrones almost, set in a wide arc and that was where the Dommes were seated. Karen noticed that Andy and Jude had the centre seats, Mel and Sarah at either end. She wondered how much this reflected some sort of pecking order. Off to one side was a table but, apart from that, the furnishings were sparse. On the wall behind the table was a large painting of an obvious slave-girl prostrate at the feet of her Mistress.

The other room, which Karen could glimpse through the openings in the dividing wall, could not have been more different. That room had no coverings on the walls, no carpet on the floor. Karen could see various contraptions dotted about. A horse like the one in the club was easy to identify, but otherwise she could only guess what they were. There was a bench running down the far wall and various whips, crops, paddles, and what seemed to be a cat-o&#8217;-nine-tails were hanging from hooks in an orderly fashion. From the care and expense that had been spent converting the cellar it was evident that this had not been done on a whim but was a serious project.

"Are you going to stand there gawping all night or am I going to get my drink?" Jude said sharply.

"Sorry, Mistress." Karen snapped back to the here and now, and went over to the thrones, offering up the drinks.

This done, she went to put the tray down on the table. Meanwhile Beth went over to Andy and knelt before her, bowing her head. Andy reached in her jacket pocket and brought out a collar. Karen couldn't help but stare as Andy fitted the collar around Beth's neck, an act that somehow conveyed not just ownership but also a tender concern. For all that Andy was full of bluster on the surface, collaring her sub was an act of love, not war.

Now there was only one Domme without a slave kneeling before her. Karen didn't need to be told what to do next. She went over and took up her position in front of Jude.

"You took your time," Jude commented. "Was there some sort of problem?"

"Just a little hiccup, Mistress," Karen replied. "My apologies for the delay."

"A hiccup?" Andy queried. "That's a lame excuse if ever I heard one. Hiccup or not, I'd give her a damn good spanking to make sure there are no hiccups next time. I know she's new, but if you don't lay down the law from the start they walk all over you."

"You'd give her a damn good spanking, hiccup or not. I've never known you need an excuse to up-end a sub and paddle her butt," Sarah joked. 

"I think we're all looking forward to that," Mel joined in. "I think we're all intrigued by our new little slave. Stop hiding her away; let's have a good look at her. Get that damn belt off her and let the dog see the rabbit."

"Here, you have a go if you're so keen." Jude took the keys out of her jacket pocket and tossed them over to Mel, who caught them deftly. "Go along, girl," she added to Karen.

This was the point which she had been dreading; in giving up her clothes she had given up her privacy and now she was being ordered to effectively offer herself sexually to another woman. However, she had made up her mind in the kitchen and she wasn't going to change her mind now. Shaking slightly, Karen shuffled over on her knees before getting to her feet and standing next to where Lucy was knelt in front of Mel's throne. Mel leaned forward and, after ordering Karen to stand with her feet farther apart, reached for the lock on the front of the chastity belt, undoing it and letting the straps fall away. The only thing that now held it in place was the dildo still lodged in her anus.

"slave Lucy," she said. "I don't want to get my hands dirty. Get rid of the belt, please."

"Yes, Mistress." Lucy turned to where Karen was stood beside her and reached between Karen's buttocks for where the dildo was attached to the strapping. Although she was gentle, the dildo seemed to resist being removed but eventually it came free. Although she was now empty, Karen could still very much feel where it had been; her back passage still felt stretched and distended and, like everything else in this crazy evening, she was unsure whether she liked it or loathed it. Once it was out Lucy stood up, and was heading for the door with the chastity belt in her hands when Andy stopped her and ordered her over.

"That's a pretty thin dildo you used there," she said as she examined the chastity belt. "She probably hardly felt a skinny little thing like that. I tell you, you're far too easy on the girl."

"She's new, she'll need to be stretched a bit before she can take the full Monty," Jude retorted.

"Well, you're not going to stretch her much with a needle dick like that. Give her something she can feel, something that makes her wince as she sits down."

Karen stood there shell-shocked, glad that Jude was not of the same mind but it wasn't just the thought of ever larger dildos being forced inside her, it was the way they were discussing it that was most disturbing. They were talking about her as if she were a doll, a plaything, and, it would seem, Jude was quite content to share her toys. As if to emphasise this, Mistress Mel reached out and started to examine her front bottom, playing with her nether lips, gently rolling them back and forth between finger and thumb and pushing back the vibrator every time it tried to slip out. Karen was a thing, an object to be shared among the Dommes; her views, her wants, her wishes were as naught. To make it worse she was there by her own free will, she was taking it unbound and unfettered, a willing accomplice to her degradation.

"She may be shy but she certainly isn't frigid," Mel commented. "Look how juicy she is." Mel held up her hand to show her fingertips glistening with Karen's secretions. "She's a hot and horny little cow on the Q.T."

'How could I be otherwise', Karen wanted to scream out loud. What with one thing or another Jude had kept her in a state of arousal for days. She had been allowed no relief and this evening in particular she had spent the entire time with both the vibrator and the dildo deep inside her. She would have had to have been made out of stone not to have been hot and bothered. Mel making out that she was some sort of hussy was so unfair.

"Yeah, beneath all that 'Little Miss Prim and Proper' she's a right little shag monster. I had her trying to hump me in the shower earlier," Jude said. "That's why I had to fit her with the belt."

Karen was horrified that their intimate moments should be shared so freely and worse, that they should be so distorted so as to portray her in such a bad light. She felt that Jude had betrayed her. This was turning out so much worse than she had thought.

"Humping you in the shower, little slave 'k', who'd have thought it. I'd love to have seen that." Sarah laughed.

"Get her to do it now," Jude urged Mel. "Hold your hand out, get her to hump that."

Mel leaned further forward and cupped her hand under Karen's crotch, even slipping her forefinger between the slick folds of flesh and poking it inside, touching the vibrator that was still thrumming away.

"Come along, girl," Mel said firmly. "You heard your Mistress."

Karen simply couldn't. This was a step too far and she was on the verge of simply refusing. She stood there with her mouth open, frozen, unable to speak, unable to move.

"Perhaps she needs more encouragement, " Jude said, taking the vibrator remote control out from her pocket and turning the intensity up. For Karen this just made it worse, just made her out to be some sort of mechanical doll who would work if you just pressed the right buttons.

"The only encouragement slaves need or understand comes from a riding crop," Andy said. "I tell you, you're far too easy on her, you give her far too many decisions. No wonder the poor girl is confused."

"Maybe you're right," Jude agreed. "'k' you have until I count to three to start humping or I'll get the crop. After that you'll get a thrashing and you'll still have to do it. One... Two...."

The threat of the thrashing brought things to a crisis; if she were going to run away now was the time to do it. She glanced about her; the mood of the room seemed to be amused anticipation, everyone, slave and Mistress, was watching her, waiting on her. Only Beth seemed to have picked up on her fears and she gave her a little encouraging wink. That was enough to calm her. This acknowledgement that her fears were understood pulled Karen back from the brink and, from here, her desire to fit in took over. If she stopped, if she said no, she would be a wet blanket, spoiling the mood, spoiling the fun. If only Jude didn't push her so hard. Why couldn't she understand how she felt?

"Three!"&nbsp; In desperation, to avoid making the decision as much as anything else, Karen pushed her hips forward, rubbing herself on Mel's hand, feeling her forefinger slip inside her. As she felt the friction of Mel's hand against her oversensitive flesh, she felt the rush begin, the drug take hold. Despite the humiliation and the conflicts inside her, Mel's touch was just what she needed. She hated this, she hated being forced to perform like some sort of circus animal for the Mistresses' amusement but, for all that, her body sang a very different tune and, if she were going to play along, the only thing she could do was close her eyes and ride it.

Maybe Jude wasn't so insensitive to Karen's mood as she got up out of her throne and came to stand behind her. Karen found her arms being drawn behind her back before the touch of cold steel around her wrists followed by the click of the lock told how she was now handcuffed. Then Jude reached around Karen to embrace her and cup her breasts with her hands. Whether knowingly or not this was just what Karen needed. Now she was no longer an accomplice, she was bound and held, forced against her will. She was no longer consenting to her own degradation, it was Jude who was doing this to her. She was back in her Mistress's arms and she was safe again. Resigned to her fate, she leant back into Jude's embrace and closed her eyes so as to forget about the onlookers and better concentrate on the mix of sensations she was being subjected to. Indeed, what choice had she but to surrender? All the pent up frustration of the past few days combined with the vibrator, now at full power thrumming away inside her, and Mel's touch against her sensitive flesh were all combining to steadily push her to where she no longer cared, where just had to hump a little harder, reach a little higher, to push a little further.... Jude's fingers were gripping her nipples, squeezing them tight and she should have been screaming in pain but it wasn't like that, she needed this, she needed... she needed... she needed....

The release, when it came, was an explosion that built within her, that built and built until she was focused only on the rhythmic pounding as she rubbed herself again and again and again against Mel's hand. She could feel her legs buckling but Jude's strong arms held her until she could take no more and her whole body spasmed. It was all too much, all too strong, she couldn't take any more but she had to, she had to, she had to....

The room spun, it all went dark and Karen collapsed like a rag doll.

When she came to, Karen found herself lying on the floor with her arms still handcuffed behind her back. Someone was bent over her and feeling her neck to find the carotid artery. She looked up to see Beth staring down at her in consternation.

"That's better, her pulse is returning good and strong again. It was just a faint, I guess she got over-excited, although it might be best if she rested for a while. A glass of water might help."

With a quick smack to her bottom, Kathy was sent off to fetch the water.

Karen looked about her. Jude and Beth were kneeling on the floor beside her whilst Andy, Sarah and Mel, although equally concerned, were giving them room. Karen noticed that Mel had her hand held out and Lucy was licking it. With a start she realised that Lucy was licking off her juices and with that the whole thing came thundering back to her. 

How could she have been so weak? Once again Jude had tricked her into making the most appalling spectacle of herself. She could imagine only too clearly what she had looked like, humping away at Mel's hand and, whilst she had been coerced in the beginning, she had needed no coercion once Jude had held her.&nbsp; She had willingly behaved like the worst sort of trollop, like a wanton slut, like.... She groaned to herself at the memory and her whole body seemed to blush. Kathy reappeared with the glass of water and, at Beth's suggestion she was helped up into a sitting position so that Kathy could hold out the glass to allow Karen to suck a much-needed drink through the straw provided.

"Is that better, pet?" asked Jude.

"Yes, Mistress, much better."

"Her colour has come back. She'll be fine now." Beth, her role as doctor now over, stood up to go over and kneel in front of Andy and resume being a 'slave'.

Gently, as if she were a little child, Jude helped Karen up off the floor and led her to the thrones. Jude sat down and manoeuvred Karen until she was sitting on her lap. Dazed, confused and more than a little overwhelmed, Karen snuggled down. Part of her hated Jude for what she had been just put through but, as she made herself comfortable, Karen felt safe and secure, a little girl on mummy's lap. Here she could appreciate the warm feelings that were still flowing through her body. God, that had been fantastic! Why did feeling so good involve feeling so bad?

"So, now that your pet has had her fun, what do you suggest?" Andy asked.

"How about a pony race? As an incentive the winner gets to put the loser on the dentist and arse fuck her," Sarah suggested.

"Fine by me. Hobbled with tails and tassels?" Mel cut in.

"Of course, is there any other way?" 

"A pony race, yeah it's been a while. A fiver says my Beth can still beat your two," Andy added. "What about the new girl?"

"If you don't mind I think my little one has had enough excitement for one night," Jude commented. "I'm not sure she's ready for pony racing."

"You're too soft on her, far too soft," Andy commented sarcastically.

Quietly Karen gave a huge sigh of relief. She had been wondering what they were all talking about and was less than enthusiastic to find out the hard way. In particular getting one&#8217;s "arse fucked on the dentist" was not only a vulgar expression; but what on earth was the 'dentist'? She snuggled up closer to Jude, grateful that she was not expected to join in for once.

"Which one is going first?" Mel asked.

"How about age before beauty, Beth, then Kathy, then Lucy?&#8221; Sarah suggested.

"Sounds good to me. Come along, my little pony slave, let's get you sorted." Andy got up from her throne and went through to the other room, returning with what looked like a horse's tail, some leather cuffs joined by chains and some other bits which were hard to make out. She put all this on the table and motioned Beth over. Beth got down on her hands and knees and Andy fitted the four cuffs to her ankles and wrists. Then she leant, reached under Beth and played with her nipples until they were erect. As soon as she was happy with this, she clipped on some tassels. Even from where she was sat Karen could see that they were quite heavy and, as they swung about, they would pull painfully on the slave's nipples. The final piece of the jigsaw was the horse's tail. Andy put on a pair of disposable rubber gloves before lifting it up to apply lubricant to the thick rubber plug at the business end. It didn't take much imagination to see where it was going to go. 

"Now that's what I call a butt plug," Andy said holding the tail out towards where Jude and Karen were sat. "Get that up your slave's pretty little backside and she'll know all about it."

Karen shuddered at the thought that anything that thick could possibly pass up the narrow confines of her sphincter but, apparently, it was due to be inserted in Beth, so it was not beyond the realms of possibility.

Andy reached down and held Beth's buttocks apart with one hand as, with a twisting movement, she used the other to work the plug into Beth's anus. Karen could see the expression on Beth's face, which was a strange mixture of pain and pleasure. Indeed it would be hard to say whether Beth was loving or loathing the experience, but whichever it was her face showed that it was intense. With the tail now fitted, Andy took off the gloves and put them on the table.

"Usual rules. Once round the entire perimeter and the slave's head must touch each corner completely," Andy confirmed with the other two. "Jude, seeing as how you're not involved, maybe you can be timekeeper. We don't want any mistakes like last time."

"Hey, that was an honest mistake!" Mel complained.

"Oh yeah. Well it was my slave that ended up getting reamed by your honest mistake," Sally retorted. 

"Enough, enough. I'll do it," Jude cut in. She slipped off her wristwatch and held it in front of her. "Are you ready?"

"One moment." Andy reached to the table and returned with a riding crop, which ended in a square of leather like the ones that had been used at the club. "Ok, when you're ready."

"Five... Four.... Three... Two... One... Go!" Jude counted down and Beth was off scampering around the room as fast as the chains around her wrists and ankles would let her. All the while Andy followed her and gave her encouraging smacks on the buttocks with the riding crop. Sarah and Mel also followed to ensure that Beth completed the course correctly. Fun or not, the three Dommes were very competitive. Karen could see the tassels that hung from Beth's nipples swinging wildly from side to side from side to side and the play of expressions across Beth's face told how this must hurt. When Beth got to the corner of the room she touched her head to the walls, before backing out and setting off again heading for the other room, with the three Dommes in tow.

From where they were sitting, Jude and Karen could not follow their progress through the corners of the other room but it wasn't long before they all reappeared, with Beth still moving as fast as she could and biting her lip in an attempt to hold back her various pains. On the home straight, Andy was really laying in to her until she finally reached the corner, nodded her head against the walls, and collapsed.

"One minute, thirty seven seconds," Jude confirmed. "Very fast, that's going to be hard to beat. Sarah, do you want to get Kathy ready?"

Andy led Beth, still in her 'pony' gear, back to the thrones and watched as Sarah prepared Kathy. The intense, if friendly, rivalry between the Dommes insisted that the chains, the tassels and the tails for the three slaves were identical. Well, the tail colours differed inasmuch as they were a match for the relevant slave's real hair, but the butt plugs were all the same, which in terms of how it would handicap the 'pony' was the crucial part. 

Kathy was next to go. She was similarly prepared and, with Sarah wielding the riding crop and Andy and Mel following, she managed a very creditable one minute forty-one seconds, which left Beth still in the lead. Then it was Lucy's turn.

Karen was quite surprised to see how eager Lucy was to get into her pony gear. Karen felt that she would have hated every second of it and there was no way she could have taken a butt plug that wide inside her without damage. Lucy, on the other hand, evidently loved it all and had given a little grunt of pleasure as the tail plug had been inserted. Karen was secretly rooting for her friend, not that she had anything against Beth or Kathy, but Lucy was the one she felt closest to. As Lucy set off scampering around the perimeter of the room, Karen could see the watch in Jude's hand and, in particular, the second hand as it raced around the dial. It was going on one minute and thirty seconds as Lucy start along the last wall and, hobbled as she was, she had a long way to go and little time to do it&nbsp; in. Karen watched as the second hand hit thirty five seconds, thirty six, thirty seven, thirty eight, thirty nine, forty, forty one, forty....

"Home!" Mel cried. "Timekeeper, how's she done?"

"One minute forty two seconds," Jude confirmed.

"Oh, come on!" Mel complained. "Surely she was faster than that."

"One minute forty two seconds," Jude repeated. "So, by my reckoning the winner is Beth and the loser is Lucy. If you ladies will prepare your slaves then we can get to the rewards."

Whilst Sarah and Karen returned to their thrones, Andy and Mel unfastened their respective slaves, although noticeably the tails and tassels stayed attached. Then Beth and Lucy went off to the other room, returning with a strange low bench. This was a wooden bench upholstered in leather and shaped like an irregular cross. There were two pairs of equal arms, one pair of about a foot, and the other maybe three feet long.&nbsp; Significantly, at the end of the two longer arms were sturdy posts reaching up to a height of four feet with a crossbar between them. Straps and chains hung off almost every bit of it. Without any prompting, Lucy lay down on her back, so that her arms were laid along the two longer arms and her head was resting on one of the shorter arms. This meant that the other arm came to about the small of her back and the rest of her body hung awkwardly off the end. Mel and Andy set to work and in no time the straps were fastened holding her arms and upper body firmly to the bench, with little room for movement.

Then Andy and Mel reached down for Lucy's ankles and, with a ritual 'open wide', they lifted them up and attached them to cuffs on the end of chains attached to tops of the pillars. This lifted and separated Lucy's legs up over her head so that what she presented to the world was her open and exposed groin. Karen could not think of a more lewd position to be in with everything so open and available, but at least now she knew why the bench was called the dentist.

With Lucy now prepared, they turned their attention to Beth. First her hands were fastened behind her back and then a curious arrangement of straps was affixed around her hips. Then Andy and Mel went through to the other room and, after some discussion, returned with a dildo, which, to Karen's inexperienced eyes, seemed enormous. They took it over to Beth and fitted it to the straps around her hips so that it looked as if she had a penis, albeit a particularly well endowed one.

Beth&nbsp; then knelt down on the floor, and Karen could see why the bench was set at the height it was; when Beth knelt forward the strap-on dildo was aimed exactly at Lucy's groin. Mel reached over and removed the tail from Lucy's backside but, almost immediately, it was replaced by the dildo, guided home by Andy.

At first Karen watched with horrified fascination as the dildo slid in and out of her friend's sphincter. Lucy must surely have been stretched to breaking point and Karen assumed it must hurt abominably. However, after a glance at Lucy's face, Karen was not so sure; it was hard to tell whether her facial contortions were pain or pleasure. What was certain was that Lucy was moving with the rhythm as far as her bonds would allow, that her body appeared to be welcoming this intruder. Beth too had a strange look on her face. In the kitchen she had shown herself to be a kind and understanding person but here she showed no reluctance in anally raping her friend.

As for the others, Andy and Mel were quietly overseeing their charges as if they couldn't quite be trusted to perform unguided. Andy had come round behind Beth and was moving sensuously against her slave, guiding her in and out, keeping the rhythm. Mel had knelt down beside Lucy and was kissing her on the lips whilst her hand played over her body, playing with the tassels on her nipples and straying to her groin.

Kathy too had moved and now sat, like Karen, on her Mistress's knee and Karen could see Sarah's hands deep between her slave's thighs which, to judge by the look on Kathy's face, was far from unwelcome. Jude too was holding Karen tight whilst her fingers played with Karen's nipples, stroking them in time to the rhythm that Beth, or was that Andy, was making. In fact it seemed like all eight women were locked together, as if all eight were feeling the dildo slide back and forth, as if all eight were feeling the ever-increasing sexual tension.

Without in anyway changing the metronomic pulse of her thrusting, Beth was increasing the intensity, pushing harder, pushing deeper and both she and Lucy were vocalising their growing arousal. For Lucy each push ended in a little mew. Karen still couldn't tell if it was pain or pleasure or even both. Beth's cries were earthier and it was evident that as she pushed against the dildo the dildo pushed back.

It was Lucy who broke first. Her mews turned to squeaks turned to cries turned to a shout muffled only by Mel's passionate kiss. Her body bucked and thrust back, straining at the straps that held her. This seemed enough to push Beth over the edge and she too gave a deep cry and thrust her body forward, wriggling her hips so as to wring the best possible sensations from the dildo as it pushed back against her groin. One, twice, three times Beth rammed herself against her friend before falling forward, exhausted.

There was a pause, a long pause, and then the whole room seemed to breathe a sigh of relief.

"Well, I think another round of drinks is in order," Jude said briskly. "slave 'k', would you do the honours?&#8221;











Karen lay in bed, wondering how it had all got this crazy. 

Once the 'pony race' was over things had broken up pretty quickly. Lucy and Beth had been disentangled and the four Dommes has gone back to their thrones to chat, each cuddling their own slave. It had all been pretty low key, except for the remnants of sexual tension in the air. Andy had been the first called it a night, pleading an early shift the next morning. She took Beth by the hand and led her upstairs. Jude and Karen followed as hosts. Karen once again helped Beth with her zipper, this time doing it up. Then it was all kisses and cuddles whilst they waited for the minibus.

The others weren't far behind, and it wasn't quite midnight when Jude and Karen finally had the house to themselves. The door had hardly closed behind their departing friends before Jude ordered Karen upstairs to bed. There, at first, Jude was the demanding Mistress and Karen spent some time with her head between Jude's thighs before it became a little more loving, a little more gentle and, before they put out the lights Karen was once again brought to a thundering climax.

But then, lying in the dark listening to Jude gently snore beside her, Karen found sleep hard to come by. Try as she might she simply couldn't shift the image of Lucy bent double with her legs asunder as Beth forced the massive dildo into her backside. Whilst Karen was fast reassessing what was and what was not acceptable this was surely, by any standards, far beyond the pale. She had really taken to Lucy, opened her heart to her, felt that she might be a true friend but this, this depravity, this debauchery, how could she possibly....

As she winced with embarrassment at the memory, she homed in on the image of the thick black dildo, glistening with lubricant, sliding remorselessly into the puckered ring. Remembering the discomfort of the relatively tiny dildo that she had worn as part of the chastity belt, Karen tried to imagine how it would feel, to imagine the pain of being stretched, of being forced wide open in that obscene manner as she was powerless to stop the violation of her most intimate parts. Surely it must be awful; surely it must be the most degrading thing, surely....

With a start she realised how worked up she had become.&nbsp; Sternly she told herself to calm down.

But calming down was hard when, following straight on the recollection of Lucy's degradation, came the thought that amongst Jude's friends this had seemed normal and, if she were to fight back her objections and continue to play along then, next time, it could be her. She imagined the horror as the straps were fastened around her, holding her arms and upper body firmly to the bench. The straps would be fastened one by one, tight and unforgiving across her flesh, remorselessly taking away her freedom and making her powerless to resist. Then, in her mind, she could feel the cuffs being fastened around her ankles. How she would fight, how she would try to defy them, but how it would be ultimately futile and her legs would lifted up and over, leaving her wide open and exposed. In the end she would be defenceless, she would have no option but to accept the intruder forcing its way inside, opening her up, violating her body. There would be nothing she could do, nothing to stop it, nothing to stop the dildo opening her, stretching her, impaling her. She shuddered at the thought.

And she remembered Andy's jeers, her comments that Jude was being too easy on her, that Jude should have given her a 'damn good spanking' for taking too long over the drinks and that Jude should have used a bigger dildo with the chastity belt, something that would make her 'wince when she sat down'. Jude had replied that she was going easy because Karen was a 'beginner'. But&nbsp; the obvious corollary was that, when she was no longer a beginner, she would be subjected to the sort of abuse that Andy was talking about. Indeed, she would be expected to allow herself to be subjected to the same abuse she had seen Lucy subjected to earlier that evening, or even worse.

Suddenly she felt hurt and alone. Just when she thought she had found somebody, more than that, just when she thought she had found a whole new circle of friends, they turned out to be moral monsters. No, that was unfair, too harsh; but what they found normal, acceptable was far outside her comfort zone. Upset by these conflicting emotions she wanted just to run away and hide. If she could have done, she would have slipped out of bed there and then but the practicalities were beyond her. With her dress destroyed earlier, the only clothes she knew of were the tube dress and the heels she had worn out that evening. She had no idea where her handbag was, so she had no idea where her purse or her keys were. Were she to leave now, as she didn't have money for a taxi nor keys to get in when she got home, she would be reduced to wandering the streets dressed as some sort of prostitute; not an appealing proposition. No, she would have to speak to Jude about it in the morning.

With the image of Lucy's violated backside still foremost in her mind, Karen finally drifted off to sleep.

"Good morning, sleepy head." Jude leant over and kissed Karen, waking her up. "I think it's time for some morning coffee. As you were such a good girl last night I'll let you wear the dressing gown."

"Umm... Good morning." Karen rolled over and returned the kiss. Last night's doubts were still strong in her mind but they could at least wait until she had had her coffee. She felt Jude's tongue pushing between her lips, Jude's hand stroking the flesh of her stomach and her body, if not her mind, surrendered. Dammit, how could she be cross with anyone who could kiss that well, with anyone who could make her feel this good, with anyone who... Jude slipped her hand between Karen's thighs and, to Karen's amazement, she was ready.

"Oh, yes, yes, please," she said in a hoarse whisper, as the back of Jude's thumb rubbed against the core of her pleasure.

"Yes, please, what?" Jude enquired playfully.

"Yes, please, Mistress," Karen said without hesitation and, as Jude continued to rub, so Karen responded.

"I'm not sure. I haven't had my coffee yet," Jude teased.

"Please, Mistress," Karen was astounded at how fast her body was responding. "Please, please, please."

"Ooh, I like it when you beg. Beg a little harder and I might just let you come."

"Please, Mistress, slave 'k' begs you to be kind to her. I'll... I'll do anything you want, anything at all. Please, just a little more...." Karen heard herself making all the promises that had got her into trouble last time but that wasn't important now, what was important was Jude's hand between her thighs, Jude's teeth on her nipples, the touch of Jude's body next to hers. She was so near to the edge that the need to climax pushed any other considerations away. Jude's hand was pushing harder at her groin and the little nibbles at her nipples had turned into sharp nips at what were now twin nubbins of pleasure. She could hold back no longer and, with a great groan of pleasure, she surrendered.

Jude gave her a minute or two before reiterating her demand for coffee.

"Yes, Mistress. Of course, Mistress," Karen said as she slipped from the covers and went over to the door where she unhooked Jude's spare bathrobe and put it on. "And would my Mistress require anything else this morning?" she asked with a playful curtsey. 

"There's plenty I require but, first of all, let's get some coffee," Jude replied and, with that, Karen went down to the kitchen and put the kettle on.

Whilst she was in the kitchen she sorted out the dirty glasses from last night and put them in the dishwasher. Indeed there were plenty of other minor tasks that caught her eye; Jude wasn't exactly a slob but she wasn't quite as house-proud as Karen either. Then the kettle boiled so she poured out two mugs of coffee. Remembering that Jude didn't take sugar in her tea, Karen assumed she would drink unsweetened coffee so, placing the two cups on a tray, she made her way back to the bedroom.

"Ah, perfect," Jude said as Karen put the mug down on her bedside table. "Now then, you've had your early morning orgasm, have I had mine?"

"No, Mistress."

"No indeed. And does slave 'k' think this is a right and proper state of affairs?"

"No, Mistress, of course not, Mistress." 

"Well...." Jude pulled back the covers and spread her legs letting the unspoken command hang in the air.

Karen was hoping to get back into bed while she drank her coffee but she could see Jude's point. Even if they weren't playing Mistress and slave there was a certain unfairness that she had been satisfied and Jude hadn't. Karen positioned herself half on and half off the bed so that her mouth was poised just over Jude's groin and, slowly, gently, set to work.

As her mouth nuzzled Jude's nether lips apart and her tongue delicately ran along the crevices beneath Karen once again began to think about what Jude was demanding of her. A mere week ago, if someone had suggested that she should kiss another woman's private parts, she would have been appalled and disgusted and yet here she was and already it was the most natural thing in the world. Caressing Jude in this way was an act of love, a caring, sharing act, and it was deeply satisfying to feel Jude's body respond. To her continuing surprise she rather liked the taste and, as the tip of her tongue searched out the inner folds, she was actually searching for more of the nectar. If she could just serve Jude like this, with possibly a little light smacking when she was 'naughty' then she would be fine, she would be well within what she could accept and there would be no problems.

She sensed rather than heard Jude put down her coffee cup so as to better concentrate on what Karen was doing between her thighs. In response Karen started to get more specific and spend less time running her tongue along Jude's nether lips and more time concentrating on her clitoris.

The problem was, Karen continued to muse to herself, that Jude wouldn't be content with such low-key games. It had become apparent last night that she and her friends were accustomed to play together at a far more intense level than Karen would ever be happy with. What is more, given the way in which they had expected her to join in, they couldn't see just how unacceptable to her the games were. She was still deeply shocked to find out that Lucy would allow herself to be so violated. She had seemed like such a sweet girl and not some sort of sex-crazed slut. Karen could never, ever, imagine circumstances where she would allow herself to be put in such a position.

Jude's breathing was shallow and Karen could feel the ever-growing tension in her body. Jude's thighs, in particular, where they lay either side of Karen's head, were taut as bowstrings. Karen flicked her tongue back and forth, rubbing quite hard against the now swollen nubbin of Jude's clitoris. She could sense the waves of pleasure flowing through Jude's body and was mirroring them with the intensity of her licking. Each wave seemed to take longer, to rise higher, to be more intense until, finally, there was the wave that simply refused to break. Jude dug her heels into the bed, raising up her hips, pushing herself at Karen. Karen pushed back, knowing that her tongue was lifting her lover, raising her up until....

"Oh yes, oh yes, oh yes, oh YES!!!" Jude thrashed about as she climaxed but Karen hung on, wanting to wring the last drop of pleasure from her Mistress. Jude seemed to lose control and Karen was having problems swallowing the juices that flowed until Jude could take no more and rolled over, hyperventilating.

For a moment or two the only sound was Jude gasping 'Oh, Yes' as she rode out the afterglow. Karen just lay there silent; she didn't want to do anything to break the mood and reduce the intensity of the experience. Finally Jude reached down and gestured Karen to come up the bed and join her and, for a while, the two women were locked together, holding each other as tightly as they could.

"Who taught you to do that?" Jude queried.

"You did, Mistress."

"Well, I must be a damn good teacher. Or maybe it's the pupil." Jude kissed Karen once again.

"So. What shall we do today?" Jude asked as she reached for her coffee.

"Isn't that up to you, Mistress," Karen said with more than a trace of sarcasm. "I thought we slaves weren't expected to have opinions."

"Don't be cheeky, unless you want a smacking."

"Sorry, Mistress." Karen's tone didn't quite match her words. "Seriously, I thought that my job this weekend was to do as I was told, that you would be making all the decisions."

"Well, when push comes to shove, that's what will happen," Jude confirmed. "However being a stern Mistress is too much like hard work and, this morning, this stern Mistress wants to spend some time with her girlfriend, not with her slave. So, I ask again, any ideas?"

"Well, I do seem to remember that I'm going to need a new dress. I'm not sure what happened to the old one, I haven't seen it since it was in shreds on your hall floor."

"Hmm... maybe we ought to get you one with Velcro fastenings," Jude joked. "Mind you, half the fun was ripping it off you."

"It was a bit...," Karen found herself lost for words. "It was wild, you were like a tigress."

"And did you like being mauled by a tigress?" Jude put down her coffee and leant over towards Karen. "If I was the tigress, what were you, the frightened deer?"

Karen had just enough time to put her coffee down before Jude pounced. Once again she was overwhelmed, once again she was swept away, once again she could only surrender. Jude pinned her wrists together with her hand and, although Karen could possibly have fought free if she had really tried, her resistance was little more than token.

"My coffee is cold," Jude complained half an hour later. "I ought to send you to fetch some more but if we don't get up now we'll end up spending the whole day in bed."

"And what's wrong with that?" Karen queried, amazed at herself for being so forward.

"I thought we agreed that you needed a new dress. Come along, let's sort out some breakfast and then we'll head into town." Jude slipped out of bed and put on her bathrobe. Karen followed suit and, grabbing the half finished coffee mugs, followed her downstairs.

As Jude and Karen made breakfast together, chatting and joking and sharing the occasional caress, Karen's concerns and worries from the previous evening seemed to fade into the background.&nbsp; It all seemed so easy, so natural, as if she and Jude had been doing this forever. After their breakfast they went upstairs to shower and it seemed inevitable that they should get in together and that there should be a certain amount of horseplay as they washed each other down. After towelling dry they returned to the bedroom to get dressed. Jude searched in her wardrobe and found a tracksuit, which, whilst not exactly Karen's size, was close enough. Along with a pair of socks borrowed from Jude and the sensible flats she had arrived in, Karen was ready to go. Jude, as ever, dressed in slacks and a shirt though her outfit was nothing like as masculine as last night's had been. 

There was only one fly in this otherwise idyllic scene and that was when Karen asked where her handbag was.

"Why do you want to know?" Jude asked curtly. "What do you want it for?"

"Well, I..." Karen started. "I might want to buy something."

"If you want to buy something, then I'll lend you the money," Jude said firmly. "We can sort it out later."

"But...," Karen tried to think of another reason and then decided to turn the question around. "Why shouldn't I have it?"

"Because I say so," Jude replied. "That should be more than reason enough. I'm the cruel and harsh Mistress, remember, and if I want to keep your handbag for now then that's my prerogative, OK?"

"I guess so," Karen said, feeling like a prop had been pulled away from under her.

"You guess so? Is that any sort of reply to make?" Jude sounded almost angry.

"I'm sorry, Mistress," Karen replied, a little subdued.

"Come along then, we'd best be off." 

Karen wondered why Jude had refused to allow her to have her handbag. On the surface it was such a small thing, nothing to get worked up about, but it was actually far more disturbing in that it dramatically highlighted Karen's dependence. She thought back to last night when she might well have run away, except that she had neither money nor keys. Taking away her handbag made her effectively a prisoner. Did Jude know this? Of course she did.

Jude, meanwhile, was also feeling uncomfortable. Getting the balance right seemed so hard with Karen. Something as simple and basic as hiding her handbag seemed to have really got to her and, somehow, she was far more upset than the matter warranted.

"Am I your Mistress?" Jude slipped her hand around Karen's waist as they made their way towards the car. "Do you belong to me?"

"Yes, Mistress, of course I am," Karen replied after the briefest hesitation.

"Then let me look after you. OK?"

"Yes, Mistress."&nbsp; Karen snuggled as close to Jude as she could whilst walking.

Once they got to the car Jude once again held the door open for Karen before getting in to the driver's side and setting off for town. It was only minutes before they were right in the centre, and Karen wondered where Jude was planning to park. Then they turned down a side street and through a gated entrance. Karen looked about her and noticed that most of the other cars were blue and yellow with blue lights on top.

"We're... we're in the police station," she said as the penny dropped. "Are you going to lock me up?"

"Best parking spot in town," Jude quipped. "One of the perks of the job. Come along now."

Again Karen had hardly got her seatbelt undone before Jude had got out of the car and round to open her door for her. Then she locked the car and led her friend out into the busy Saturday shopping crowds. As the walked down the streets Jude reached out and held her hand, which felt simultaneously so right and so wrong. It was so right inasmuch as Karen seemed to want to spend her whole day touching Jude; just being near her somehow made things better. It was so wrong inasmuch as Karen felt as if everyone was staring; that Jude's short hair and masculine clothes marked her out as lesbian and, by association, that everyone would know that Karen was too. Whist she had come to terms with sharing her bed and body with another woman, she was far from ready to let the rest of the world know. She was scared witless at the thought that they might run into anyone from work or, worse still, one of her brothers or sisters.

They made their way through the market and into the St George's Mall. Karen assumed they were heading for Marks and Spencer, or possibly using it as a short cut through to British Home Stores, but before they got there Jude guided her into New Look, a shop Karen associated with teenagers and certainly not a place she had ever been in . Jude went straight over to the rails and started picking out dresses.

"Jude, please. These are all far too young for me," Karen hissed urgently.

"Are you questioning your Mistress's judgement?" Jude raised an eyebrow at her.

"No, of course not but...."

"But nothing." Jude held up a dress against Karen to see how it would look. "Yep, these will do, let's try them on."

Jude guided her towards the changing rooms but insisted on waiting outside. Karen went inside and looked at the first dress. Fortunately it was a smock design with a high waist so she could try it on without taking off the bottoms of the tracksuit. She slipped it over her head, did up the tie at the front and went out to the body of the shop to show Jude.

This turned out to be the start of a long drawn out process. They must have tried a dozen dresses on in New Look and then on to Top Shop, French Connection UK and Next. In the end, inevitably, they were back at New Look and the smock dress. Once again Karen tried it on, this time, at Jude's insistence, without the tracksuit bottoms.

"That's the one," Jude said. "You look great."

"It's a bit... girly," Karen said, looking at herself in a full-length mirror.

"And what's wrong with girly?" Jude demanded.

"Well, at twenty nine I'm hardly a teenager any more. Anyway I thought you didn't do girly," Karen protested.

"I don't do girly on me," Jude clarified. "On you, however, that's another matter. I want my sub to be a pretty little femme. Come on, let's pay and we'll get some lunch."

"Shouldn't we get some leggings?" Karen asked.

"Whatever for?"

"Well, this dress, it's a bit short."

"Nonsense, it's just right and it shows off those lovely legs of yours to a tee. If you think I'm going to hide them behind leggings then you've got another think coming."

Jude led Karen over to the tills and, after a short queue, they paid for the dress. They then set off to find some lunch but on the way they passed a shoe shop and there, in the window....

"Those are the ones!" Jude exclaimed.

Karen looked to where Jude was pointing and, indeed, there were a pair of heeled open toe sandals that were the perfect match for the dress. To Karen surprise the heels were low, maybe an inch and a half; certainly not like the ones she had worn last night. Jude went inside and Karen could only follow.

When the assistant had found a pair in the right size Karen was delighted to find how comfortable they were; these were shoes she could wear all day. As soon as Jude saw how well they fitted that was it, they had to be bought and, minutes later, they were back out in the mall with Karen now carrying two bags instead of one. Then, at last, it was time for a caf&#233; and lunch. However, they had hardly found a table before Jude ordered Karen to go off to the toilets and change.

"Come along now, I didn't spend all that money to have you sitting around in one of my old tracksuits. I'll order omelette and chips for us both, you go and change."

Karen was just about to protest both about being ordered to change and about having no say in what she ate for lunch when she saw the look in Jude's eye and reckoned that obedience was the best option. She went over to the toilets, found a stall and, rather delicately given her distaste at public toilets, changed into her new clothes. As she emerged and was crossing the mall back towards the caf&#233; area she had a flash of panic about how short the dress was. She had never, ever worn anything so short, well, except maybe the tube dress last night, and the flared smock design meant that there was plenty of room for the air to circulate and the cool breeze around her nether regions was a reminder of her knickerless state. The heels, whilst not high, were pronounced enough to change her walk and she was aware of the swing of her hips and how this made the dress flow around her. It was not that she was dressed as a tart, as she had been last night, but that was at night, this was the daytime and she did feel very naked in this very public place. As ever, just when she was beginning to feel comfortable with Jude she found herself, once more, being pushed just that bit too far.

Feeling more than a shade uncomfortable, she went over to the table and sat down opposite Jude, finding, as she did so, that she had to reach behind her and sweep the hem of her skirt beneath her or she would have been sitting on the seat with her bare bottom. 

"You look fabulous," Jude said as she leaned over to kiss her.

This was too much for Karen, far, far too much. She looked about her; it felt as if the whole world were staring at her, as every one in the mall was privy to her nakedness under the dress. Jude seemed to have no feeling for her nervousness, no understanding of how hard it was for her. She just gave out the orders with no thought for Karen's needs or wishes. She understood that she was playing at being a 'slave' but really. She had to put the breaks on.

"Look, Jude, I'm not sure I can do this. Can we stop being Mistress and slave for a minute?"

Jude's immediate reaction was to say 'no', to tell Karen to stop moaning but she was fast finding that she needed a lot of patience&nbsp; with Karen.

"Why, what's up?" she asked, trying, and failing, to keep the frustration out of her voice.

"It's all too much. I mean, you've spent far too much money on me." Karen wasn't sure how to voice her real concerns so she fumbled for and excuse.

"Are you trying to tell me how I should, or should not, spend my money?" Jude sounded quite cross.

"No, of course not, but...." Karen couldn't find the words to state her objections. Of course it wasn't the money, well, not directly, it was the way that Jude had taken over her life, the way that Jude was making every single decision, the way she had become a thing, not a person. In some ways this was worse than the bedroom games, although that was another point that she needed to address, there at least were some limits and, when the games were over, so was the control. This was her life, all of it, and now she couldn't do anything without Jude's say so. It wasn't that the dress was awful; it may have been too short but, she had to admit, it was very pretty and suited her colour. Similarly the shoes were perfect in many ways but, importantly, it didn't feel like her dress, they didn't feel like her shoes and the meal, when it arrived, would not be her meal. She had become Jude's plaything, her doll, her new toy, and no amount of money could make that right; indeed, it just made it worse.

"Look, Jude, I just don't think I can do this 'slave' stuff. I don't think I'm cut out for it. I like you, I really like you but I don't think I can play these games."

"Why? What's wrong?" Jude seemed truly perplexed. "Haven't I looked after you? Haven't I treated you like a princess? What more do you want?"

"I want... I want... I want to choose my own omelette," Karen said but as soon as the words were out she knew that, whilst this meant perfect sense to her it didn't clarify things with Jude in the slightest.

"Choose your own omelette? What in hell is that supposed to mean?" Jude was getting quite angry.

"It means I don't want to be your slave any more," Karen blurted out. "I can't do it, I just can't."

"Well, don't you run hot and cold," Jude said nastily. "I don't seem to recollect too much reluctance when we were in bed this morning, and last night you came so hard you fainted. You had no problems being my slave then."

The waitress chose that moment to deliver the omelettes and Karen blushed deeply at the thought of what she must have just heard.

"So, what would you have chosen seeing as how this omelette isn't good enough for you?" Jude continued as soon as the waitress had gone.

"The omelette is fine," Karen admitted. "It's just what I would have chosen."

"So where's your fucking problem?"

"Please, Jude, please don't be nasty."

For a while the two women just sat there, eyes downcast, wondering what to do next. Karen, for the sake of something to do, poked at her omelette; but it tasted like ashes and she couldn't manage more than a mouthful or two. Jude didn't even bother with that, but just stared at Karen as if she were a monster with two heads.

"Do you know, I really thought we had something special. Sure, it's early days but I've never felt so close to... Dammit woman, what the fuck's the matter with you? Why can't you just..." Jude almost threw her fork down on the plate. "I can't do this either. Come on, I'll run you home."

Jude took out her wallet, found a twenty-pound note and threw it on the table. Then she got up and with a curt 'come on then' led Karen out of the mall and back to the car. They drove all the way back to Jude's house in silence. Jude parked up outside and curtly told Karen to wait in the car. She disappeared inside returning five minutes later with Karen's overnight bag, which she tossed across onto Karen's lap. Karen looked inside, wishing immediately she hadn't.

"It's all there," Jude said, her voice void of emotion.

"I never thought..." Karen started.

"That's it, you never think," Jude snapped and, with the silence still hanging heavy, they drove back to Karen's house where they pulled up outside. Jude didn't say a word as Karen opened the car door and got out.

"Jude, please, I never meant it to end like this," Karen said, turning back to the car with tears in her eyes.

"Fuck off. Just fuck the bloody hell off." And, hardly waiting for Karen to close the passenger door, Jude drove off with a squeal of rubber on tarmac.









Jude sat at her kitchen table feeling sorry for herself. What with the necklace, two dresses, two pairs of shoes, not to mention the drinks last night, she had shelled out a fortune on Karen, that silly little bitch. That would teach her to go after mousy little straight girls. She should stick with the girls who knew what they were, who weren't suffering from doubts every thirty seconds, who didn't end up running away.

And then, crashing through her self-pity, came the appalling sense of loss. Karen, ditzy little Karen, was really someone very special under all that frumpiness. There was the way she bit her lower lip whenever she was about to take another leap into the unknown. There was the tremble in her voice whenever she was pushed a little further than she liked and, above all else, there was that determined look as she overcame her fears and plunged on in. Jude was beginning to appreciate just how far and how fast she had pushed Karen. How many times Karen had been a million miles outside her comfort zone? Maybe she did have a point, maybe....

Dammit, she didn't have a point! She had agreed to be a slave for the weekend and had been nothing but trouble. If she can't stand the heat then she's better off out of the kitchen. Silly little cow.

She was still entangled in this train of thought when her phone went. She glanced at the screen, most of her hoping it would say 'Karen' but was disappointed to find that Lucy's name was there instead.

"Hi, Lucy. What's up?" 

"Hi Jude. Look, 'Sisters Together', Masie's band, they're playing at the Adelphi pub, you know, the one on the Fylde roundabout. Mel and I thought we'd go down and give our support and wondered if you and Karen wanted to tag along."

"Err, no, sorry, we...." Jude tried to think of an excuse on the spur of the moment and failed.

"Are you OK?" 

"I'm fine, just fine," Jude insisted.

"No you're not. I know that tone of voice. Come along, Judith dearest, tell Auntie Lucy what's the matter."

 Jude would never have taken this from anyone else. Apart from anything else, she hated being called Judith, albeit it was her 'official' name. However, Lucy was one of her oldest friends and had been a shoulder to cry on time and time again in the past. If anyone had earned the right, then Lucy had.

"Karen and I... we've fallen out. Look, it wasn't going to work, we're too different," Jude admitted.

"Oh?" Lucy prompted for more.

"I don't know, we were getting on fine and then she took umbrage at something and we had words; she said she couldn't... that I... that we... Well, we both said a lot of things and I ended up taking her home. We're not right for each other."

Lucy, who had very different views on whether they were right for each other or not, gently prompted her friend to talk, until all the details came tumbling out. They were on the phone for nearly an hour as Jude poured out her side of the story. The more Jude complained about how impossible Karen had been, the more Lucy was reminded of the Hamlet quote: 'The lady doth protest too much, methinks.'

Meanwhile, on the other side of town, Karen was sitting at her dressing table, fingering her necklace and wondering what to do about it. What with one thing and another, both she and Jude had forgotten all about it and now she was stuck with wearing it. After all, it was held on by a padlock and only Jude had the key. She peered into her dressing table mirror and studied the gold chain closely, admiring the strength and quality of the links; it really was quite beautiful, well, if you ignored the name-tag. And, if she were really honest with herself, even the name-tag had a certain something. It was almost as if it were an engagement ring or something, but, had it been an engagement ring, she could have taken it off. Without resorting to damaging the necklace, and she felt it would be sacrilege to have to cut it, she was stuck with it until she got in touch with Jude and she wasn't quite ready for that yet.

She sighed at the waste of it all. If only she and Jude had been more compatible, if only, if only, if only.... She felt the tears welling up and fought them back. She had things to do, but ever since Jude had dropped her off, almost thrown her aside, all she could manage was to sit at her dressing table and stare at herself in the mirror. Somehow she couldn't find the energy to do otherwise. Indeed, she was still wearing the dress and the shoes and, moreover, she hadn't bothered to put on any panties. Part of this was her apathy and part of it was the way it had become quite normal over the last week to dress like this and, somehow she didn't want it to end. Putting on panties would be admitting she had failed, admitting that it really was over.

Had failed at what? she asked herself. Had she 'failed' to join in with all their sick perverted games, had she failed to do everything Jude had demanded of her right up until the moment when....

The thought of their 'sick perverted games' brought back recollections of what had happened the previous night and, in particular, how Lucy must have felt when she had been anally raped by that enormous dildo. Try as she might, she could not shake the image and somehow, much as it repelled her, it also fascinated her and, abhorrent as it was, she needed to find out for herself what it must have felt like. Here in her own home, alone, no one would know and it wouldn't hurt to do a little experimenting. Of course she didn't own any sort of dildo, let alone something as large as had been used on Lucy, so she went off on a search for something suitable. She was looking in the lounge when an arrangement of candles caught her eye. She had been quite keen on candles at one point. Surely she had some spares somewhere.

She searched the cupboard under the kitchen sink where her collection had been stored away, found a box of assorted spares and selected one of the thicker ones, one which was maybe an inch in diameter.&nbsp; She did have some candles that were thicker still, but she was realistic about what she could or should attempt. Even then she was going to need all the help she could get and some lubrication would be essential. Remembering that she had some baby oil in the bathroom cabinet, she went upstairs to find it. 

Feeling incredibly daring, she went to her bedroom and closed the curtains before taking off her dress. Laying out an old towel to protect the covers, she got onto the bed and took the candle from the bedside table where she had put it. Suddenly it looked huge in her hands. She felt stupid for even contemplating doing this, but a little nagging voice in her head told her she'd always be curious if she didn't so it was time to get on with things. Should she apply the oil to the candle or to herself? Perhaps it would be easier on herself, so she put the candle back down and took the baby oil instead. Squeezing out a good dollop of the oil onto the tips of her fingers, she reached down between her legs to apply it. It was awkward and she was having trouble reaching until she lifted up her knees, which brought to mind the position Lucy had been in on 'the dentist'. She could almost feel the straps; almost see the others gathered round watching.&nbsp; 

Another squeeze of oil and her whole anal area was slippery so she pushed the tip of one finger inside herself. There, that wasn't too bad, in fact it was rather nice. However that wasn't the point of the exercise. She put down the oil and reached for the candle, pressing the pointed end against the puckered ring of her sphincter. This was it; this was where she found out. At first there was a little resistance but she was soon easing the candle bit by tiny bit inside herself. Initially she just felt stretched although, after a couple of inches it began to get too uncomfortable so she stopped going any deeper. God, it felt so depraved, so disgusting, so... so....

She couldn't help herself; as her left hand held the candle steady inside her, her right hand started playing with herself, reaching for the inflamed nubbin of her clitoris. Her fingers were still slippery from the oil, not that she really needed it, her private parts were already slick with her juices. Part of her wondered what on earth she was doing but the amazing feelings from 'down there' were too strong to resist and she was pushing herself nearer and nearer to....

The sounds of 'Constant Craving' came from the floor next to her bed; the damn phone was ringing. For a moment she tried to ignore it but the mood had been broken. She couldn't concentrate, so, sliding the candle out from inside her, she rolled over and reached for her handbag.

"Hi, Karen, it's Lucy." 

"Hi, Lucy, what's up?" Karen said, still slightly out of breath.

"Why don't you tell me?" Lucy said. "I've just been chatting with Jude and she's in a right state. What have you two been doing?"

"It's... it's complicated." Once again Karen was finding it hard to find the words to explain the complex mix of emotions inside.

"Do you want to talk?" Lucy asked.

"Please, I'd love to," Karen said, thankful that she could unload.

"Why don't I come on over?"

"Just you or will Mel be with you?" Karen queried.

"Just me, I think that's best, don't you?" 

"Thanks."

"See you in fifteen minutes then," Lucy said and hung up.

Gingerly Karen picked up the candle, took it downstairs and threw it in the bin before going to the toilet and cleaning herself thoroughly. She was oh so aware of where the candle had been; even after she had wiped and wiped, the slightly slippery, slightly full feeling remained and felt deliciously naughty. She was mindful of two issues she hadn't fully faced. The candle that she had used had been much thinner than the dildo used on Lucy and, furthermore, she had only inserted it a couple of inches. Heaven knows how Lucy had managed to take so much of such a monster. She put her dress back on, went down to the kitchen and put on the kettle ready for her guest.

"Wow, nice dress!" Lucy exclaimed as she came in the door.

"Yes, Jude bought it for me," Karen explained.

"And I see you're still wearing her necklace. You can't hate her that much."

"Hate her!" Karen was horrified that anyone could think such a thing. "How could I possibly hate her? She's kind, generous, loving, everything I could have hoped for except...."

"Except?" Lucy prompted.

Karen led her through to the kitchen and poured out two cups of tea before replying.

"Except... except I don't know," Karen admitted. "I really tried, I did my best to please her but I felt smothered. I couldn't breathe, I needed space. Oh, Lucy, I really like her, really I do but she can be a bit much. She even ordered my meal for me. Don't I have any say in things?"

Secretly Lucy thought that a Domme ordering for her sub was part and parcel of the experience, but she wasn't going to argue the toss directly.

"So, let's see if I have this straight. You didn't mind being ordered to strip naked and being told to hump another Domme's hand, right? And you came so hard you fainted, yes? But you do mind having your meal ordered for you?" Lucy asked. Karen was quite shocked by the bluntness but Lucy's smile, as ever, disarmed her.

"It does sound a bit stupid when you put it like that, and god knows I must have looked awfully ungrateful after she bought me the dress and all but...."

"But?" Lucy prompted.

"Oh, I don't know." Karen was nearly in tears. "One moment everything is wonderful, I couldn't ask for a better friend. The next I'm just... I'm just... Oh, Lucy, it's all this Domme and slave stuff. I guess I'm not cut out for it."

Again Lucy had firm opinions that differed considerably, but she wasn't going to push any more. She realised that Karen had to make up her own mind. After putting her arm around Karen and making a few 'poor you' comments, she listened to Karen's confused tangle of complaints against Jude, before tactfully changing the subject. With Lucy's gentle guidance they discussed the weather, Eastenders, Corrie, X-Factor, Strictly and Masterchef until, with a glance at the clock, Lucy said it was time for her to go. Karen was surprised to find how much calmer she had become. Ignoring the problem had made it go away. She felt as if Lucy had answered all her worries although, for the life of her, she couldn't see how. As for the necklace, well, it would just have to wait until she was ready to face Jude.

"Look, Mel and I are going out to watch a friend's band tonight," Lucy said as she got up out of her seat. "Why don't you come along? After all, I know you've got nothing else planned. We'll pick you up just short eight o'clock. Wear that dress, you look great like that. Please say you'll come."

"OK," said Karen, slightly against her better judgement; still, anything was better than Saturday night telly. "I don't normally go to that sort of thing but if you're going, then I'd love to."

"See you later then. Seven forty-five. Be ready." And with that Lucy picked up her handbag and set off for the door.

Karen went upstairs and took off the dress. If she was going to wear it that night, she didn't want to get it all dirty while she did her housework. She put on some sloppy-joes and, with her earlier apathy gone, set to with the vacuum cleaner.

At seven fifteen Karen was upstairs getting ready to go out. She had had a long hot bath and was sitting at the dressing table putting on her makeup. She couldn't help but think back to the last time she had done this under Jude's watchful eye. Jude had commented how she liked her slave to look pretty; well she would damn well show her that she didn't need to be a slave to look pretty, but then, of course, she wouldn't, because she wouldn't be seeing Jude. That brought her thudding back down to earth. Jude had been such a big part of her life for the past week that it seemed sad that, apart from when they met to remove the necklace, they would never meet again.

Her makeup done, it was time to get dressed. She reached down to her panties drawer and pulled it open. God, what a boring selection! Not wearing panties for a week was now focussing her mind on those that she owned which were, without doubt, the most boring collection of passion killers ever put together by womankind. It would almost be better to go without than to put any of these on. That went for tights as well. Her selection was uniformly black and a pretty heavy denier, nothing that looked in any way sexy or glamorous; any of them would have clashed with the carefree attitude that the dress suggested. So why wear them? Sure, the dress was short but it wasn't that short. If she went without, no one but her would be any the wiser. If she had learnt anything from the week she had just been through, it was that going without panties was no big thing. Anyway, it was all part of showing Jude what she was missing, or rather not showing Jude but, for all the faulty logic, it made sense to Karen.

And then it was seven forty-five and Mel's car was pulling up outside. Apprehensively excited, Karen checked her handbag to ensure she had money and her keys before going outside to meet them. 

"Hi, Karen." Lucy had got out of the car to greet her. "Jump in the back."

Karen got in and Mel greeted her warmly. Karen was glad that her split with Jude hadn't ruined her friendship with the others. Well, she hardly knew Andy, Beth, Sarah and Kathy, which seemed odd in itself given that they'd all seen her naked, but Mel and Lucy were already quite important to her. 

It's only five minutes&#8217; drive from Karen's house to the Fylde roundabout; but parking in that part of town is a nightmare and it was gone eight when they finally entered the Adelphi. As usual on a Saturday, the pub was packed to the gills. They made their way to the bar and ordered drinks before looking around to see if there was a table. Of course there wasn't, so they had to stand and Karen was once again grateful for her new shoes. They were so much more like party shoes than any others in her collection, and yet they were comfortable enough to wear all night. They found a corner where they could see the stage and settled down to chat. It was nigh on half past eight when....

"Hi Mel, hi Lucy, hi...." 

Karen turned from the pillar, which had half hidden her to see Jude staring back at her. Jude's face dropped, she turned on her heel and headed for the door. Karen glanced at Lucy and realised that she had been set up. She was furious but at least she owed Jude an explanation, to point out that she hadn't known, that she wasn't in on the plot. She put down her drink, grabbed her handbag and raced after Jude who was just passing through the door.

"Jude! Jude!" She shouted to the figure fast departing down the dark streets. "Stop, please."

At first Jude was easily outstripping her, but busy traffic held Jude up when crossing the road and, panting from the exertion, Karen caught up with her.

"Please, Jude, I know what you're thinking but it wasn't my idea,"&nbsp; she pleaded as she grabbed Jude by the arm.

Jude turned to face her, and was about to push her away and snarl something nasty when the look on Karen's face under the sodium glow of the streetlights made her think twice.

"No, I guess it wasn't. This looks like the work of that interfering minx Lucy. Not that it makes any difference. This isn't how I want to spend the evening."

This time it was Karen who saw the pain in her friend&#8217;s face, and, in doing so, she realised that she wasn't the only one who was hurting.

"Look, Jude," she said gently. "I know I hurt you. I'm sorry, really sorry. I get so...." Once again Karen got stuck in the emotional minefield surrounding how she felt about Jude. "I never really said thank you for the dress. Look, it really suits me." Karen stood back and struck a pose.

"You're welcome," Jude said gruffly. "I see you're still wearing the necklace as well."

"Well, I can't really take it off. You've got the key."

"Yeah, I hadn't thought of that." Jude reached in her pocket and pulled out her key ring. "Here, I'd best undo it now."

It would have been easier if Karen had turned her back but it seemed more natural just to step towards Jude and bow her head. This, of course, meant that Jude had to put her arms around her to reach behind her neck. She felt Jude fiddling with the lock. It was under Karen's hair and hard to find when the only light source was the streetlights. Karen could feel Jude's warmth, she could smell that wonderful Jude aroma, the soap that she used, a clean wholesome smell. She felt at home, she didn't want this to end. Jude had finally found the keyhole and had put the key in when....

"Jude, please," Karen said softly.

"What? I'm working as fast as I can. It's damn fiddly out here."

"No, I didn't mean that. Jude, please leave it on."

There was a long silence.

"And why should I do that?" Jude asked.

"Because I'm sorry," Karen said meekly. "Sorry I hurt you, sorry I got scared, sorry I behaved the way I did."

Again there was a silence until Karen heard the click of the padlock being refastened.

"I'm sorry too," Jude said quietly. "Can we find somewhere to talk?"

"What about the Adelphi?"

"And have that bitch Lucy crowing over us all night? I don't think so. Anyway I want somewhere quiet, somewhere where it's just the two of us."

Karen looked about them at the Saturday night crowds as they milled about here in the heart of the university area. One thing was for certain, there was nowhere around that was going to be quiet.

"Your place?" Karen suggested meekly.

"Come along then." Jude took her by the hand and led them up the hill towards the police station. Karen guessed that Jude used it every time she was in town. Sure enough they walked into the yard and over to Jude's Astra. They were just pulling out of the yard when Karen's phone started ringing. As Karen pulled the phone out of her bag Jude stopped the car. As soon as Jude saw the name 'Lucy' on the screen she reached over, grabbed the phone from Karen and switched it off. 

"Wha...," Karen started to complain.

"Just wait," Jude said, noticeably not driving away. Then, thirty seconds later, her phone went. Jude pulled it out of her jacket pocket, glanced at the screen, turned it so that Karen could read that it was also from 'Lucy' and then switched it off as well.

"I'm not quite ready to hear Lucy crowing over how she got us back together," Jude said.

"Are we back together?"

"I hope so. I really hope so. Now let's get home."

They drove off in silence, but a comfortable silence, a silence of knowing there will be time to talk soon enough and that, for now, the other&#8217;s company is enough. They pulled up outside Jude's house and she looked across at Karen.

"OK?" Jude asked gently.

"Yes, OK," Karen replied simply.

Jude got out and, ever the gentleman, went round to open Karen's door for her and hold her hand as she got out. This simple act, which only that morning had felt overprotective and suffocating, was now gallant and caring and, once again, Karen loved being Jude's femme. Together they walked up the garden path, together they opened the door, together they went inside and, together, they fell into a clinch.

"God, I thought I'd lost you," Jude gasped between kisses.

Karen was well beyond words. All her doubts, all her fears, all her second thoughts just melted under the overwhelming force of Jude's kisses. She wanted, no needed, to lose herself within the all-consuming fire of Jude's passion. It wasn't just the necklace, it was far, far deeper than that; she wanted to be Jude's, Jude's lover, Jude's girl, Jude's slave.

Jude too just wanted to hold Karen tight, to gather her in, to make sure she never lost her way again. She wanted to feel, just feel and her hands automatically went to the hem of Karen's dress so as to touch the warm flesh of her thighs. Her hands reached round for the twin globes of her buttocks, her bare, pantyless buttocks.

"Ooh, who's a naughty girl going out without her panties on?" Jude said with a twinkle in her voice.

"I am, Mistress. I'm a naughty girl," Karen responded.

"I might have to smack you later." Jude still kept it light and playful.

"Yes, please, Mistress. Please will you smack this naughty little girl?"

"Bedroom, now!" Jude said simply and, taking Karen by the hand led her upstairs.

As soon as they were there Jude undid the fastening at the neck of Karen's dress and lifted it in one smooth movement over her head. Then, without shedding one item of her own clothing, Jude sat on the bed and lay Karen across her knees.

"Are you a naughty girl?" she asked again.

"Yes, Mistress."

"But you're my naughty girl, aren't you?"

"Yes, Mistress."

"And you'll let me look after you?"

"Yes, Mistress."

"OK, then." And with that Jude smacked Karen smartly on her buttocks and kept on smacking until the bright red flesh had had enough. Then in one smooth movement she lifted Karen up, spun her round and laid her on the bed beside her before lying down on top and smothering her in kisses. One hand delved between her thighs and started to work its magic.

"All better now?" Jude enquired between kisses.

"Oooh! Yes, Mistress." Karen squeezed out between gasps of pleasure.

"Then come for me, baby, come for me now," and, as if on command, that's exactly what Karen did.









"Good morning, sleepyhead." Jude gently shook the still-sleeping Karen and, as she wiped the sleep from her eyes and sat up, handed her a cup of coffee.

"I thought the slave was supposed to make the coffee," Karen commented contritely.

"Well, normally yes but you were sleeping so soundly that it seemed a crime to wake you and you wouldn't want a copper committing a crime, would you?" 

"But you're all dressed as well." 

"Yeah, I figured you'd want a toothbrush, and we're low on milk so I popped to the corner shop." Jude looked abashed, almost as if she were ashamed of being helpful.

"Umm, well, I'm awake now. How can I thank you for getting me a toothbrush?"

"I thought you'd never ask," Jude said with a smile and, moments later, her clothes were in a pile on the floor and she was back under the covers with Karen.

"My coffee's cold," Karen commented when they resurfaced some time later. "I wouldn't dream of asking you to make me another, so I suppose it's time for me to get up and get on with the day."

"I thought you wanted to stay chained to my bed as a sex slave," Jude joked.

"Can I go to the loo first then, please?" Karen replied carrying on the joke. 

"If you have to," Jude said, "but seriously, I'm ravenous. How about you cook us some brunch?"

"Certainly, Mistress. It will be an honour and a privilege."

"Don't be cheeky! Get your butt down to the kitchen immediately."

Karen slipped out of bed, grabbed Jude's spare bathrobe from behind the door and, with Jude following closely behind, went down to the kitchen to start cooking. And there, despite the rather unusual setup, Karen was in domestic bliss. A competent if unadventurous cook, she enjoyed providing for those about her and, as she plated up the mixed grill she had put together and put it on the table in front of Jude, she felt as if she was really providing for her man, or woman, or....

Whilst she was growing ever more comfortable in her relationship with Jude, Karen was still seriously confused as to exactly what her role was. Her rather old fashioned and closeted upbringing had taught her that a woman's place was to serve her man, to support him in his needs and requirements and, in many ways, what she was doing here was simply replacing that mythical man with Jude. After all, Jude wore the trousers both figuratively and literally. Meanwhile Jude liked her to take a 'feminine' role, liking her in skirts rather than pants and wanting her to look 'pretty'. Furthermore she really appreciated the 'gentlemanly' aspects of Jude, the way she held doors for her, the way she looked after her. Similarly she felt supremely at home making Jude's brunch.

But, if it were as simple as Jude being the 'man' in her life, she still wondered what others might think. She knew she would have to keep her new lover secret and that hurt; her heart was singing and she wanted to tell the world. Her brothers and sisters would just be amazed that she had embraced a lifestyle so far from the norm; they would be shocked and horrified into the bargain. As for her work colleagues, most of them had accepted Mel easily enough, but some hadn't and she wasn't, and never could be, Mel. Surely, once they found out, they would use her sexuality as yet another stick to beat her with.

Jude finished her plate and sat back looking content. Karen took this as her cue to whisk the dirty dishes away and start clearing up. As she stood by the sink her curiosity started to get the better of her.

"Jude, err... Mistress," Karen said as she rinsed out the pans prior to putting them in the dishwasher.

"Yes?"

"The cellar... I mean the playroom...." 

"What about the playroom?"

"Can you show me around? I didn't get to see it properly on Friday." 

"Show you the instruments of torture, you mean," Jude laughed. "What's brought this up?"

"I... I'd just like to have a look." There was no way that Karen was going to admit to her recurrent thoughts about what had happened to Lucy on 'the dentist'. And she surely didn't want to find herself similarly restrained, not to say used, but her curiosity had been piqued and she wanted to see exactly what else was down there.

"Well I'm going to get dressed. You finish off down here and when I return I'll give you the tour. Maybe even a few practical demonstrations," Jude said with a broad grin on her face.

"I didn't mean...," Karen started to protest.

"Uh uh. You started this; you can't back out now. If you're going to get awkward about things then there are plenty of toys down there that might help you to a better understanding of the full benefits of willing obedience." 

"Yes, Mistress." Karen wondered what she had got herself into. They say that curiosity killed the cat, well, maybe it wouldn't kill her but it might put this little kitten into some very uncomfortable positions.

Jude came back down ten minutes later to find Karen using a Brillo pad to polish up the wire frame from the grill pan. She sat back and let Karen get on with it. Apart from any other benefits it looked like having Karen around meant that she was going to end up with a spotless kitchen. What's more Karen looked rather sweet in just a bathrobe and bright yellow Marigolds. She watched as Karen finished off and left the grill pan on the draining board to dry.

"Come along then. Let's see what's in the playroom." Jude stood up, went out into the hallway and reached for the key where it hung on its hook. Karen took off the rubber gloves and followed out into the hall.

"Ladies first." Jude unlocked the door and opened it, motioning to Karen that she should go through. Karen started towards the door but as she got there Jude stopped her.

"I don't think we need this," she said, plucking at the bathrobe. "Not quite the playroom dress code."

As soon as Jude said this Karen knew for certain that her trip to the playroom was going to be more than just looking, she was definitely going to get practical demonstrations as well but, after all, she had been the instigator and, although she was loath to admit it, maybe she'd been playing for this all along. She undid the robe, shrugged it off, and went back into the kitchen to drape it over the back of a chair. Feeling a little cold and a little foolish she returned to the hallway, went though the door and down the steps into the cellar. Jude gave her a playful smack on her buttocks as she went by.

"First things first," Jude said as she followed down the stairs behind her. "You had best learn how to light the fire. It's quite simple."

Jude showed her the controls to the integrated gas fire and in no time the artificial coals were heating up and warming the room with their red glow. The main room, the throne room, had little that Karen hadn't already seen. Indeed, Jude must have tidied it on Saturday afternoon. 'The dentist' had been put away along with the various bits and pieces, which had been left on the table. 

However, on the other side of the divide it was very different. Karen had got a fair impression from what she had seen through the gaps on Friday. In comparison with the opulence of the throne room, here the walls had been left as bare brick and the floor was stone flagged, which combined to give the room a 'dungeon' feel. There was another gas fire, which Jude ordered Karen to light, but, even when warm, there was no way this room was ever going to be cosy. Also, in comparison to the near empty throne room, this one was quite busy with a chest of drawers, a bench right along one side, and four large wooden structures stored at one end.

At the front, where Jude had replaced it after Friday, was the low bench arrangement Karen immediately recognised as 'the dentist'.She already knew exactly how that was used, how it could hold a girl open and exposed so that the part of her so lewdly presented to the world was her well spread buttocks and all that lay between. She stared at it in such fascination that Jude couldn't help but notice.

"Memories of Friday night?" Jude asked with a smile. Karen just kept silent. 

Jude then led her over to the next device, a horse, a little over waist high, similar to the one she had seen in the club. Karen reached out and stroked her hand along the padded top. The leather was beautifully polished and well cared for. Jude explained that keeping it that way would be one of her tasks after the next time it was used. As with the horse at the club, there were adjustable cuffs attached by chains to the four corners. At Jude's suggestion, Karen stretched herself over it so as to see how she could be positioned across the way or, if Mistress so desired, lengthways. At one end the leather surface was shaped with a central ridge. Again Jude insisted that Karen should lie along it so as to experience just how she could be positioned so that the ridge would put pressure on her most sensitive areas.

The third item was a St Andrews cross, two long beams, hinged in the middle like a pair of scissors. Both the crosspieces and the supporting network behind them were held together by butterfly bolts. This meant that, by choosing which of the numerous holes the bolts went through, the cross could be made as wide or as narrow as desired or adjusted so that the angle to the ground went from nearly upright to about forty-five degrees. The beams were well padded and leather covered, with straps at regular intervals to hold the victim in place. What Karen couldn't make head-nor-tail of were the complex fittings around the crux of the cross, until Jude showed how various hook shaped brackets which could be attached, so that the dildo on the end would impale the victim, either front or back, depending on whether she were facing away from or towards the cross.&nbsp; Karen shuddered at the size of some of the dildos.

The final item was a set of old-fashioned stocks. The main component was a solid frame within which various cross pieces could be positioned anywhere from close to the floor up to almost shoulder height, depending on whether the victim was to be held by her ankles or by her neck and wrists.

"These must have cost a fortune," Karen commented as she examined the workmanship and quality of the various items. "Where on earth do you get them from?"

"There are specialist suppliers if you know where to look and, as for the cost, we've found from long experience that it pays to get the best we can afford and all the girls chip in. After all it may be my cellar but they all get to play with them," Jude explained. "Now, come and look at the rest of the stuff."

They went over to the bench, above which various whips, crops and floggers hung decoratively on the wall. Jude pointed out her favourites. Then it was on to the chest of drawers.

"Try the second drawer down," Jude urged.

Karen went over and opened the relevant drawer. Inside was a selection of vibrators and dildos of all sizes ranging from the tiny, as had been used as part of her chastity belt up to the sort of monster, which Beth had used on Lucy. In horror she picked up one of the bigger ones and studied it.

"Is that what you'd like me to use on you?" Jude enquired sweetly. "Do you think you could take a monster like that?"

Karen didn't know if Jude was serious or not.

"Please, Mistress, I don't think I could...."

"No, I don't think you could either. And much as we could have fun trying I don't want to end up damaging my property. I think we should try for something a little more suited to a beginner like you." Jude came over and stood beside Karen and picked out something considerably thinner and shorter. "This is your sort of size, for now anyway. You're a virgin, aren't you?"

"Yes, Mistress," Karen whispered.

"What's that, speak up girl."

"Yes, Mistress, I'm a virgin," Karen said a little louder.

"Shall I wear this as a strap-on and pop your cherry? Shall I?" Jude waved the dildo in Karen's face amused by the wide-eyed look of horror. 

"Or maybe," Jude continued, "maybe we should leave that for another day. Maybe I should turn you over and come at you from behind. You'd like this up your bottom, wouldn't you? Oh, you'd pretend to be scared, to play the little innocent, but secretly you'd love it. If you were strapped to the cross then we could both pretend that nasty Mistress was buggering you against your will but we'd both know that wouldn't be true, wouldn't we?"

Karen was unnerved by how well Jude seemed to have read her inner thoughts. She did indeed have dark desires that she was reluctant to admit, even to herself. She would never, ever, willingly submit herself to the indignities that she had seen Lucy put through but if she were strapped down, unable to protect herself then.... The very thought was simultaneously thrilling and repulsive and this conflict troubled her deeply.

"But enough of this talk of penetration." Jude realised she had pushed Karen about as far as she could go, for the moment, and decided to lighten the mood somewhat. She put the dildo back in the drawer and pushed it shut before opening the one above it. "How about we smack that pretty little bottom of yours. Which do you fancy?"

Karen stared at the collection of crops and paddles that lay within the drawer. As with the dildos, the range stretched from the mild to the severe. One, shaped like a leather hand with a wooden handle reminiscent of a table tennis bat was almost comical. At the other end of the scale were thin whippy canes that Karen could tell would sting painfully even if used gently. She was drawn to the 'fly swatter' riding crops with their four-inch square of leather at the end, the ones which had been used during the 'pony race'. She reached in and picked one out.

"Is that the one?" Jude queried, taking the crop from her and swishing it through the air. "Is that what you'd like me to punish you with?"

"I didn't mean...," Karen started and, in truth, she didn't. She had been simply curious but now she realised that she had effectively chosen it. "If it pleases Mistress," she said, trying to cover her confusion.

"Smacking that gorgeous butt of yours will always be pleasing to me," Jude replied. "But let's not rush into things; let's see what other toys we have." 

Together they moved on to the next drawer.&nbsp; At first this appeared to be a jumble of leather, rubber and chrome but as Karen rummaged through she began to make sense of the contents. Apart from various cuffs with their attached 'D' rings, there were numerous gags of various types. Karen immediately recognised the ball gags; they were similar to the one Jude had used on her, back at the club. The ring gags were less obvious but when Karen picked one out to examine it Jude showed her how it worked, how, by forcing the mouth open it prevented the wearer from making any articulate sounds. The bar gags all had 'D' rings either end, making them look like the bits from horses' bridles. It didn't take much imagination to see that, whilst not as effective at silencing as a ball gag, these were more about control.

The final drawer contained a few odds and ends including the tails that the 'ponies' had worn during their race. At Jude's bidding, Karen picked one up and examined it. It consisted of two component parts so that the tail part could be used on various differing sizes of butt plugs, depending on the whim of the person fitting it. The tail itself didn't just affix straight to the plug but had a hard rubber strip which ran up between the buttocks to give the impression that the tail came from the base of the spine as it would on a real horse. There were four actual tails, three of which matched the hair colour of Beth, Lucy and Kathy. Karen wondered whom the fourth tail belonged to.

"So then, now that you've seen the toys in the playroom, the only question is where do we start?" 

"I'm not sure...," Karen started.

"Whether you are sure or not is of no relevance," Jude retorted somewhat sharply. "You asked for this and it's too late to back out now. I intend to suitably restrain you and then spank your bottie, understood?"

"Yes, Mistress."

"However, as I'm a kind and generous Mistress I will allow you to choose how you will be restrained. You have seen the options; which one would you like to experience?"

As ever, the hardest part for Karen was to actively participate; as long as it was something that was done to her, she had the excuse that she was powerless to prevent it. However, if she were to choose then her complicity would be implicit and, as such, she would have to admit to herself that she actually wanted all these perversions. Sure, she knew that this tangled logic wouldn't stand close scrutiny, but it was important to her. 

"Come along, now, don't keep me waiting," Jude said as Karen just stood there unable to make a decision. "Or maybe you'd like me to choose for you?"

"Yes please, Mistress," Karen felt safe again. 

"How about &#8216;the dentist&#8217;? That seemed to grab your attention earlier," Jude suggested. Karen merely nodded meekly.

Jude went over and pulled the contraption to the middle of the room.

"Lie down. I know you understand how it works."

It was a bit awkward at first. With the main base coming only to the small of her back Karen had to support herself with her feet but, when Jude knelt down beside her and started fastening the straps, she was soon secure and going nowhere. There were four straps along each arm, the first just beyond the shoulder and the last fastening over the wrist. These were augmented with two much wider straps across her body, one just above and one just below her breasts so that, whilst she was free from the waist down, she was firmly secured above that. Then Jude took each ankle in turn, lifted it up, over her head and fastened it to the cuff that hung from the upright post. She was now bent double and spread wide open. Karen couldn't fight the desire to close her legs but it was futile; there was a little play in the chains but her position was fundamentally fixed.

"Now what else shall we use?" Jude said as she went back over to the chest of drawers. Karen craned her head to see but, whether by design or accident, the chest of drawers was beyond her very limited field of view. A few moments later Jude returned, put some bits and pieces down on the ground and knelt down beside her.

"This will do for a start; help to concentrate your mind." Jude leant forward and lifted up Karen's head so as to blindfold her. Although the blindfold was made of leather, the inside was well padded with soft velvet and, as it was fastened with the Velcro strapping, it proved to be light proof and Karen could see nothing. Jude was right, the blindfold did seem to focus Karen's thoughts and make her more aware of her body and the contorted shape it was held in.

 "Open wide," Jude ordered. Karen did as she was told and felt the soft rubber of a ball gag filling her mouth. Once again Jude lifted her head to fasten the strapping behind her.

"Can you breathe?" Jude asked before putting Karen's head back down and Karen nodded in reply. 

"Here's the bell," Jude added and Karen felt her hand being opened and something round and hard being placed into it. "You remember how to use it?" Jude queried and, once again, Karen nodded.

"One final touch," Jude said sweetly and Karen felt her nipples being played with; immediately they responded, getting harder and more prominent. Jude suddenly stopped and she felt a hard pinch on each of them, a pinch that went on and on and on.

"Perfect!" Jude said and Karen could almost hear the smile on her face. "Isn't this fun?"

Fun is not a word Karen would have used but she couldn't deny the intensity of the experience. Unable to see, unable to speak, unable to move, she had no way of preventing Jude from doing anything she wanted or even anticipating what that might be. The twin points of pain from her nipples were far from unbearable but seemed to be connected by little wires direct to her nether regions. She felt open, she felt exposed, she felt vulnerable; much as she trusted Jude, did she trust her this much, trust her enough to give her this absolute power over her? 

Suddenly Karen's whole body shuddered as, out of the blue, she felt something, presumably Jude's fingertips, trailing down the inside of her thigh. Softly, gently and, above all, teasingly, Jude stroked and caressed her upper thighs and groin. All the time she kept up a running commentary but she really need not have bothered. Karen's whole world was centred around her groin. She was so focussed on the sensations from a million nerve endings along her inner thigh and the creases at the top of her legs that Jude's commentary was relegated to a background murmur. This half and half was far worse than she had expected; far better to have nothing than this teasing that left her nerves screaming for more. If only she would just stop teasing then Karen could feel the start of the orgasm that was gathering, an orgasm that would prove to be as earth shattering as every other she had had at Jude's hands.

On the other hand, if, as she suspected, she was to be spanked with the crop, then why, oh why, wasn't Jude just getting on with it. The crisp clean smacks with their purifying blend of pain and pleasure would be easier to deal with than this teasing, this endless teasing.

Jude ran the tips of her fingers along the very edge of Karen's nether lips and Karen couldn't help but respond by straining against her bonds, trying to push herself towards her tormentor, trying to open herself up further. A few muffled squeaks of frustration escaped through the confines of the gag.

"Ooh, you like that, don't you? Look how slick and ready you are," Jude commented as her fingers eased the lips apart. "Are you ready, ready to be spanked?"

Karen was dumbfounded by the question. How could she answer, she was gagged and unable to speak. She felt Jude's fingers pinching at her sensitive flesh and the frustration levels spiralled towards boiling point.

"Well, are you?" Jude prompted.

"Yes! Yes!" Karen cried out, but, of course, all that came out was unintelligible.

"Can't quite make out what you're saying." Jude said sweetly. "Was that a yes?"

"YES!" Karen screamed almost in rage but again no actual words emerged.

"I think that is a yes but I think you're not quite ready, there's one more thing to be done." 

Jude withdrew her fingers and stood up. Karen wasn't sure whether she was happy or sad; her flesh certainly missed Jude's touch but at least the teasing had stopped. It wasn't long before she heard Jude kneel back down.

"Now then, this will go much easier if you can just relax," she said.

Relax! How on earth was Karen supposed to relax? She was as taut as a bowstring, physically, mentally and emotionally, and the last thing possible to her was to relax. Then she felt something blunt pushing at her sphincter and that just added to the tension. She wanted to cry out to Jude to be gentle, that she had tried with candle, quite a thin one, and had only been able to take a couple of inches, but there was nothing she could do, nothing to stop it, nothing to prevent Jude doing whatever she wanted. She tried to grit her teeth but the gag prevented even that.

At first Jude was having trouble getting even the tip of whatever it was past the tight ring. Karen could feel that it had been well lubricated but she was too tight, she was too tense. Then the tip overcame the resistance and she was being forced open, forced wide, wide open. At first it was merely a different sensation but it soon moved on to uncomfortable and that discomfort moved on to pain. She bit down harder on the gag; she couldn't resist it, she couldn't fight it, all she could do was lie there and take it. This was so, so different from her experiments with the candle; there she had been in control and had known from the start the size of whatever was being put inside her. Now she was deep into the unknown; how far would Jude push her, how far would Jude expect her to go?

The stretching reached a crescendo and Karen was close to tears when, suddenly the width narrowed and she felt her sphincter take a tight grip. She remembered the plugs that had been attached to the tails, how they had had a Christmas tree shape and now she knew for certain that one of those Christmas trees was inside her. The feeling of being stretched to breaking point was gone to be replaced by a full feeling; this was bigger than whatever had been attached to the chastity belt but not unbearable.

"There, that's better," Jude said as she stood back up again. "Now don't go away, I won't be long."

Karen heard Jude's footsteps receding and now she was all alone. Bound, gagged and blindfolded, all she could do was listen to the multiple songs her body was singing. The throb from her pinched nipples, the fullness from her behind, the unresolved tension from her nether regions all demanded a resolution; being left alone was the cruellest thing Jude could have done. In her mind she was begging Jude to just get on with it; she would gladly take anything, anything at all rather than be left alone like this.

Jude was so silent that she never heard her return which, of course, was the intent. She barely heard the swish before her buttock exploded with fire. The actual strike probably wasn't that hard, but the sheer surprise made her buck and struggle against the bonds which held her. She needn't have bothered; they were far stronger than she was, and she could do nothing to stop the next blow, or the next, or the next. Jude was a Mistress of the crop and the blows stung rather than hurt, but they were relentless and incessant and in no time Karen felt as if she had sat in a patch of stinging nettles. As the fire turned to an inferno Karen fought against the straps and chains only to find how, ironically, they helped inasmuch as they gave her something to fight against, somewhere to put the intensity of the sensations.

In her mind she could see how obscene she must be looking, how, with her legs wide open, her sex gaping and her bottom filled with the butt plug, with her nipples clamped and her ever reddening buttocks presented to the world, she could have no dignity; she had become what she despised, a depraved slovern, a wanton slut, a bad, bad, bad girl. But, as she wallowed in this self-loathing and welcomed the thrashing that such a one as she surely deserved, she also felt an elation, a freedom, an exaltation. For all the pain, for all the discomfort, she had never felt anything so strongly. It was as if she were alive for the first time. Here, bound and held, she could accept her needs, needs that had been suppressed for so very long.&nbsp; She was floating, floating away in a multicoloured spiral of pain and pleasure, of good and bad, sweet and sour, heaven and hell. The relentless pounding on her buttocks was driving her higher and higher until she could take no more but she had no choice, she had no choice, she had no choice....

She had no choice but to surrender to the intensity of it all.

Jude sensed that Karen had reached her zenith so she stopped, put down the crop and knelt down to hold and cuddle Karen as much as she could, given the bonds that held her quaking body. Once Karen's climax started to subside she reached round as gently as she could behind Karen's head and undid the gag and the blindfold. Karen blinked from the light and flexed her jaw as Jude kissed her gently and soothed her as she would a baby.

"That was... that was...," Karen started.

"Shh. Don't try to explain," Jude said. "Now let me sort you out."

After a final kiss Jude reached for the nipple clamps and undid them. As the blood returned, they hurt far more than they had when the clips were put on and, now that she was coming down from the high, Karen was beginning to be aware of just how battered her body was. It wasn't just her backside, which felt as if she was on fire, a bad case of sunburn was the nearest she could compare it to, but her limbs were cramped from being held in this bizarre position and from having strained against the bonds. With the nipple clamps free, Jude knelt back up and went round to behind Karen and reached for the butt plug. It came out easier than it went in, mostly because Karen was more relaxed. Jude put it carefully to one side before returning and undoing the chains that held Karen's ankles. Moments later Karen was being helped to her feet. Karen reached round behind herself and rubbed her bottom.

"I rather fancy a walk in the park," Jude said as if nothing out of the ordinary had happened. "We'll need to find you some clothes though."

"All I've got is the dress and that's getting a bit manky."

"Yeah, we'll have to go to your place on the way. Tell you what; seeing as how we've got to take the car we'll make a day of it. Let's go to Beacon Fell. It's a lovely day and we could do with the fresh air. Come along. You can clean up in here when we get back."

And with that the two women left the playroom and went back upstairs.









Jude didn't need to get changed before they left. The jeans and red plaid shirt she was already wearing were perfectly suitable for a walk in the country. She did, however, take the time to go upstairs and grab a jacket and, when she returned, the pockets bulged ominously. When they got to Karen's house, they went upstairs to her bedroom. Jude told Karen to wait while she rummaged through the wardrobe, looking for a suitable outfit. Karen's mild suggestion that it might be an idea if she could keep a few clothes, just a small selection, at Jude's house, fell on deaf ears. It wasn't that Jude had actively told Karen that she didn't want it; rather she just ignored any prompting from Karen.

When it came to selecting clothes that were suitable for a brisk walk in the country, Jude was spoilt for choice. Most of what Karen owned was best described as "sensible" and "hardwearing"; there was absolutely nothing that could be described as risqu�. However, when Jude found a kilt at the back of the wardrobe she leapt upon it with glee and, matching it with a cotton blouse and a jacket over the top, she insisted that this was the only possible outfit for Karen to wear. Karen, who just saw the kilt as yet another knee length skirt, couldn't see what the fuss was about.

Then it was out of the town and off into the countryside. Jude, a graduate of the police driving course, was competent and experienced behind the wheel. She made short work of the ten miles through the lanes out to Beacon Fell. When they arrived the car park was nearly full, but Jude found a place where a family was just leaving, and pulled into the vacant space they left behind. Once again, she had hardly stopped before she was out and round, opening the door for Karen and helping her out of the car.

As the blip-blip of the remote locking sounded, Jude took Karen by the hand and led her firmly away from the car park. On a Sunday afternoon Beacon Fell is a popular destination but it's spacious enough that, with a little effort, one can get away from the crowds and find some solitude; and it was immediately evident that Jude was prepared to do just that. Her job kept her fit and strong and, as she strode out, Karen had to work quite hard to keep up with her. Jude led them deeper and deeper into the woods and further and further away from the crowds until, maybe a mile or so from the car park, they came upon a quiet clearing where the grass had grown to waist height. With the practiced ease of one used to subduing criminals, Jude led Karen to the centre, tripped her up, caught her as she fell and lowered her to the ground, hiding them from view. Jude used her body to pin down her victim and kissed her long and hard. Karen couldn't have resisted if she'd wanted to and, heaven knows, resistance was the last thing on her mind.

Without breaking from the kiss, Jude reached for Karen's wrists, pulled them above her head and held them firmly together with one hand. Still using her body to keep Karen pinned, she reached between them with her other hand, found the buttons of Karen's blouse and, inevitably, started to open them. As soon as she did so Karen's struggles went from playful to very real.

"Jude, please!" she said, breaking away from the kiss. "We're in public. Anyone might see us."

"You had best keep quiet then if you don't want to attract attention." Jude knew from many previous visits that, even on a busy Sunday, few, if any, visitors to the fell would stray this far off the beaten track and, furthermore, hidden in the long grass, they would be able to hear anyone approaching long before they were seen. It therefore amused her to see the rising panic in Karen's face. Taking her time, she carried on undoing the blouse buttons until they were completely open, and she could push the blouse aside and expose Karen's breasts.

"Umm... you do have the most biteable nipples," Jude said with a grin before leaning forward and taking Karen's left nipple between her teeth.

"Please, Jude, please, you're scaring me." Karen was getting desperate; she tried to free her arms so as to push Jude away.

"And you're squirming about too much," Jude complained. "Now shut up and lie still. It's a shame I didn't bring any rope. If I had you tied to a tree I could do whatever I wanted without all this squirming. You'd like that, wouldn't you?" 

Karen was seriously conflicted. She was genuinely anxious at being so exposed out in the open. There had been so many people in the car park; what if they were discovered? It was all right for Jude, she was still fully dressed. It wasn't Jude who was showing everything above her waist. On the other hand, the way she had been thrown to the ground played straight into every fantasy she had had as a girl. She had always pictured herself as the victim in some Victorian melodrama and, whilst Jude, having neither a top hat nor a waxed moustache, didn't quite fit the stereotype, this safe "rape" was deeply thrilling and her body was responding as ever. For all that she was struggling she was still careful not to struggle too hard.

"Well, I asked you a question," Jude said. "Should I tie you to a tree and have my wicked way with you?"

"Please, Mistress...," Karen replied, uncertain how to put into words how she felt. Of course, the thought of being tied up in such a public place was horrifying but the simple idea, the fantasy, sent such vibrant tingles through her, and her groin was crying out 'yes!'

"Maybe a tree would be just a little too public," Jude conceded. "How about we try this instead?" 

She reached for her jacket pockets and pulled out her handcuffs and, in a trice, slipped them around Karen's wrists. Then she reached for the inside pocket of her jacket and pulled out a tent peg. This she pushed into the soft turf before attaching the handcuffs. Truth be told, Karen could probably have got the tent peg out if she had really tried but, now deep into the fantasy, she was held fast. 

Jude didn't let it stay at that, and Karen soon found why Jude's pockets had bulged so much. Having knelt up so she could look above the long grass and check that all was clear, Jude fetched&nbsp; from her pockets two leather cuffs and two more tent pegs. Karen didn't have to ask what was coming next and although she made lots of 'Please Mistress, please don't do this' noises she didn't put up much of a fight and the feel of having her ankles restrained just enhanced the experience.

"There, that's better," Jude said as she rearranged Karen's jacket and blouse to further expose her breasts. "Now let's see to this kilt."

Jude reached for the buckles at the waistband of the kilt and, suddenly, Karen realised why Jude had been so keen for her to wear it. The kilt, being the genuine article, was wraparound and once the buckles were undone it was simplicity itself to unwrap, leaving Karen completely naked below the waist and the kilt no more than a rectangle of tartan material lying on the ground. Jude trailed her fingertips around Karen's groin, noting how her nether lips glistened with evidence of her excitement. This reassured Jude that, despite Karen's protests about playing 'al fresco', she wasn't completely averse to what was being done to her.

"Now you just wait here a moment. I know just the thing for you." Jude got to her feet. "Don't go away."

With that Jude disappeared from Karen's sight. This was completely unexpected and Karen's anxiety levels shot through the roof. What was Jude doing? How far was she going? How long would she be gone? She craned her neck to look around but all she could see was the blue sky above and the long grass around her. The only sounds were birdsong and the rustling of leaves in the wind. If she weren't alone, naked and pinned to the ground, this would have been a perfect day. As it was, it was turning into a nightmare. Her rising panic was just beginning to get out of hand when she heard the swish, swish of Jude returning through the long grass. When she came into sight, Karen could see that her hand was wrapped in a handkerchief which, along with the distinctive leaf shape, told her that the plant Jude was carrying was a stinging nettle.

"How are you doing, OK?" Jude said pleasantly as she knelt back down again. "Look what I've brought for you. You will enjoy this."

"What are you going to do?" Karen asked. Like every Brit she had learnt as a child to treat stingers with respect.

"Just this." Jude replied as she gently stroked the plant across Karen's breasts.

Karen gasped with surprise but at first it wasn't too bad. It stung, as you would expect, but it was not as painful as she had anticipated. However, when Jude stroked the plant across a second time it seemed to stoke the fires and the stinging turned into a burning and the desire to rub away the soreness became irresistible. Karen started to twist and turn, straining against her bonds. 

"Jude... Mistress... I don't think I can...," Karen started.

"Yes you can," Jude insisted as she drew the stinger back across once more. 

"Please, no more." Karen pleaded, her eyes filling with tears.

"Just one more then I'll stop," Jude replied but this time instead of stroking the plant across Karen's flesh she pointed the tip straight at Karen's nipple and swished it around. Once she had repeated this on the other side she threw away the plant and lay down next to her captive.

"Please, Mistress, please, I need..." Karen said between gasps.

"What do you need?" Jude asked.

"I need... I need..." But Karen wasn't sure what she needed. The screaming fire from her nipples was so intense she could barely stand it and as she struggled to contain it she could feel herself unwittingly working loose the tent peg at her wrists. But that wasn't what she needed; freedom was not the answer. The twin throbbing orbs of fire in her breasts were stoking a fire in her groin and she felt that if Jude didn't do something soon she would burst.

"Let me guess, is this what you need?" Jude asked as she trailed her fingertips along Karen's groin.

"You know that's what I need," Karen replied, the urgency of her situation making her forget her manners.

"What, like this?" Jude rested her fingertips at the top of Karen's nether lips and rubbed them back and forth in gentle circles.

"Harder, please, Mistress, harder, please, for the love of god!" Karen was far beyond such subtleties and needed redder meat. She writhed against her bonds, trying to push herself against Jude's hand.

Jude took pity on Karen and pushed her fingers firmly into Karen's sex and leant across to kiss the red rash that covered her breasts. Karen, overcome with the intensity of the sensations within her, pushed herself as hard as she could against Jude's hand, gritting her teeth as she did so to stop herself from crying out loud. Even so she couldn't stop herself from gasping, from expressing vocally how she felt physically, and Jude clamped her free hand over Karen's mouth to gag her. In fact, it took all Jude's strength to restrain Karen as she struggled against her bonds and the powerful forces that were wracking her body. Feeling like her breasts were going to explode, Karen resorted, uncharacteristically, to bad language.

"You bitch, those nettles sting like crazy, you knew how much they were going hurt, you knew what they were going to do to me, you fucking bitch!" Karen muffled snarls came through Jude's hand. "I hate you, I hate you, oh god I...."

As Karen lost control, her thrashing about tore the tent pegs from the ground. She flung her handcuffed wrists around the neck of her tormentor, pulled them together and just let the emotions flow. Still humping Jude's hand she rubbed her breasts back and forth against the rough material of Jude's jacket in an attempt to reduce the searing pain. This didn't diminish it much but in the endorphin rush of her orgasm it became just another part of the roiling within her. For one long, long moment her whole body was the twin peaks of her enflamed nipples until, finally, the wave broke and she just held on, sobbing. Slowly, gradually, her senses returned and, exhausted, she lay back gasping for breath.

"Are you OK?" Jude asked, her voice full of concern.

"That was... that was... that was almost too much to cope with," Karen replied. "That was pretty intense. You really know how to...," Karen rubbed herself once more against Jude's jacket, "My breasts, Jude, please, they're still stinging like crazy. Please, you've got to do something."

"Hang on; I've got some cream here somewhere." Jude delved into her pocket and brought out some antihistamine cream, which she squeezed out and started to apply to the vivid red rash.

As Jude's fingers eased the cool cream across Karen's breasts, the fire finally started to subside and she was finally able to relax again. The soothing cream was a heavenly contrast against Karen's still sensitive nipples and she could feel her appetites, never fully quiescent, reawakening. However, as her focus on the sharp stinging from her breasts became less acute, the light breeze playing across her body made her suddenly aware of her nakedness again.

"Jesus!" she gasped. "Please, Jude... err... Mistress, please, may I get dressed again? Please, enough, I've had enough." She held out her locked wrists in front of her.

"Ok, hang on, just let me finish here." Jude smoothed out the last of the cream, wiped her hands on her handkerchief, and found the keys to the handcuffs in her pocket. As soon as her hands were freed, Karen reached down, bundled her skirt around her waist and re-secured the buckles. Then she set to buttoning up her blouse until she was happy that she was once again 'decent'. However her clothes weren't the only things awry. Although she had no mirror she could tell her hair was all over the place, making it obvious what she had been doing. She tried to smooth it down with her fingers.

"God, I must look a mess." 

"I've seen you better," Jude admitted. "How are the nips, still sore?"

"They're... They're OK, I guess. The cream has helped a lot but I'm still smarting a bit. That was a lot to cope with. I'm sorry I called you an effing bitch, I don't normally use language like that."

"That's OK, I understand. I've had it done to me so I know what it's like. Seriously, are you OK?"

"Yeah, I'm fine... now." Karen admitted. "Thank you, really, thank you."

"For what?"

"For... Jude... You make me feel...." Karen snuggled up to Jude as she stumbled for the right words. "I've never felt anything like the way I have since I met you. I'd never had an orgasm before I met you and now... well, you're making me do things I'd never have dreamed of doing before." Karen realised she wasn't explaining herself very well. "Look, it's not just the sex, it's more than just the sex, Jude, please, tell me that it's more than just the sex for you too."

"Oh honey, of course it is," Jude replied. 

"It's just this is all so new to me. I mean I was a complete virgin just a couple of weeks ago and now I'm behaving like some sort of floozie, rolling around stark naked in public. It's a bit much to take."

"Yeah, but you're my floozie. I'll look after you. Do you trust me?"

Trust, there, she'd said it, this was the crux of it all. Did Karen trust Jude? She wanted to, she really wanted to and, on Jude's terms, she did. What Karen wasn't sure of was whether she trusted Jude on her own terms, whether Jude really understood the leaps of faith that she was making almost daily. In the post orgasmic glow and wrapped in Jude's arms, she could forgive her anything but the memory of how it had felt just a few minutes ago, of being tied up and naked out here in the open, that had been really frightening. Her trust that Jude really understood what she could and couldn't take had been badly shaken.

"Yes, Mistress, I trust you," Karen said at last. It was too complicated to explain the niceties and she didn't want to ruin the moment. 

And suddenly all Karen's objections seemed churlish. She snuggled even closer into Jude's arms and felt safe, protected, wanted. It was beyond doubt that their relationship was unconventional, and Karen wondered if she would ever be at ease with some of the things Jude seemed to expect from her, but it was as if she had come home, and right here in Jude's arms was where she wanted to stay.

Jude also was deeply content. She had her doubts; Karen was so uptight about some things but the way she gamely played along, the way she was prepared to overcome her reluctance, spoke of a courage hidden deep within. More than that, once the frumpy exterior was pushed aside, she was a sexy little thing and Jude felt that she had never been so strongly attracted to anyone ever before. Was this lust or love? She neither knew nor particularly cared. She gently pushed Karen back down to the ground and kissed her long and hard.

As Karen felt Jude's lips lock onto hers she also felt her body respond. She had never known anything like this before. Until so recently, sex had never been an aspect of her life and it really hadn't been something she had missed. Sex, like love, was what happened to other people. Now her every waking moment seemed to have its sexual side and just a word, a kiss, a touch from Jude made her knees go weak and her juices flow. Her nipples, still throbbing from the stingers despite the cream, seemed to demand attention and as for her groin, it wanted, no needed, Jude's touch and she would do anything to get it. She was becoming addicted, addicted to Jude. Despite her reservations, she reached up and, once again, her blouse was unbuttoned. Jude was only too keen to oblige.

Several hours later Jude looked up from their nest in the long grass.

"It's getting late. We ought to be making a move," she said.

"Do we have to?" Karen asked. "I could stay here forever."

"Yes, we have to. Anyway I'm getting hungry."

"I suppose so," Karen said reluctantly. "What do you want to do about eating?"

"There are some salmon steaks in the fridge. Can you cook them?"

"Of course, Mistress. Your wish is my command." 

"Come along then." Jude got to her feet and helped Karen up as well. As they picked their way back through the woods, the shadows were lengthening making the hollows dark and mysterious. 

"Jude... Mistress, have you ever tied anyone to a tree?" Karen asked, as off hand as she could manage.

"I might have," Jude replied. "It's a bit risky out here."

"Risky? You had me stark naked not so long ago." 

"Yeah but we could always have covered you up in a trice and the long grass gives good cover. Having you tied to a tree is a lot more conspicuous and a lot harder to get out of. Anyway, why do you ask?"

"Oh, just asking, just asking." Karen tried to brush the question away.

"No you weren't. I know your 'just asking'." Jude grabbed Karen, spun her around and pushed her against the nearest tree, pushing her arms back as if to fasten her wrists on the other side. "Is this what you want?" 

Karen couldn't speak. This was exactly what she wanted. The rough bark against her back, the way her arms pinned behind the tree forced out her breasts. She wanted Jude to ravish her, to rip the clothes from her body, to take her.

"Sorry, as I said, it's too risky out here," Jude said as she relaxed and let Karen go. Even in the half-light Jude could see the glint in Karen's eyes. If that is what she wanted, well, there were options available, there were other woods she knew of which were a lot less public.

Later that evening, Karen and Jude were relaxing on the sofa; their meal was over and they had settled down to watch TV. Well, the TV was on but how much they were watching it was another matter. Jude sat upright whilst Karen lay full length with her head in Mistress' lap.

"Mistress, about Friday night," Karen started.

"What about Friday night?" 

"Do you do that often? Well, you must do, look at all the stuff you have down there."

"We don't do every Friday, and we don't always have all eight of us, but we try to," Jude replied. "Why do you ask?"

"It's just that... Look... Jude...," Karen struggled; this was something she had to clear up but she didn't want to end the weekend on a sour note. "I don't mind the stuff we do, well, most of it, but doing stuff with other people, I'm not sure I can."

"How do you mean?" Jude sat up straight.

"I mean it's all right when it's with you, I lo... I really like you and you're special and all that but doing stuff with the others, that's not right."

"What's not right about it?" Jude asked, now quite serious.

"I mean... I mean I'm not ready, I don't think I'll ever be ready to make love with anyone else but you."

"Even when it's me that's ordering it?"

"Even then."

"I don't see why." Jude was a little short. 

"But I do," Karen insisted. "Please, Jude, please, if you care about me, don't ask me to do things I can't."

Jude looked down at Karen.

"And what about the rest of us? In particular what about me?"

"That's up to you, well, I'd prefer it if you didn't...."

"And where's all this coming from?" Jude asked.

"It's just.... Look, Jude, I know you think I'm being a bit of a prig but that's the way I am. I don't want to be a wet blanket but I'm not ready for some of the things you're into. I'm not sure if I'll ever be ready."

"So, what does that make the rest of us, immoral sluts?"

"No, no I don't think that at all, honest I don't. I really like your friends, all of them; it's just that it feels a bit icky having sex with them."

"But half the fun is the mix-and-match." Jude made one last effort to change Karen's mind. "We even swap roles from time to time; give the subs a chance to get their own back."

"Please, Jude, this is hard enough for me as it is. I'm really not into group sex. It doesn't feel right for me but I know it would be unfair to ask you to stop altogether. Can't you meet me half way on this? We'll still do Friday nights, I'll even get naked with the rest of the subs, but I don't want anyone else but you touching me sexually."

Jude thought fast. This was going to complicate things considerably and she had no idea how the others would react. She could of course, take a hard line, a 'my way or the highway' sort of thing but... well, wasn't that what had gone wrong on Saturday? If she really wanted Karen, and she did, then maybe a little bit of compromise was in order. Maybe she could bend a little, for the immediate future, at least.

"Let's just take this one day at a time," Jude said with a sigh. "Until you're ready I won't force you to do anything with anyone else but me and I won't do anything with any of the others. OK?" 

"Thank you, Mistress." Karen said, much relieved. "Really, thank you."

And with that the incident was over.

Later that night, Jude ran Karen back to her house, explaining that she had to get up early on Monday morning. Karen, who had been hoping to spend the night, was somewhat disappointed but reluctantly understood. When they got to Karen's house Jude walked her to the front door.

"Goodnight, sweetheart," Jude said after a passionate kiss on the doorstep.

"Goodnight and thanks for a wonderful weekend," Karen replied.

"I'll phone you tomorrow," Jude said, as she pulled Karen back into another clinch.

"Please, Jude, not here. The neighbours might see," Karen said nervously

"And what if they do?"

"Please, Jude, for me."

"Ok, Ok, goodnight honey," and with that Jude was off.

Karen let herself in to the cold dark house. Her nipples still throbbed a bit from the stingers, her backside was still a bit sore from where the butt plug had been, her sex was tender, albeit in a nice way, from all the sex they had had, and she felt battered and bruised all over. However she felt a contentment that she had never felt before and, as she stumbled exhausted to her bed, she was blissfully happy. 










Monday morning came as Monday mornings are prone to. Karen rolled over sleepily and hit the snooze button on her alarm clock. She had been awakened from a wonderful dream featuring Jude, herself and the Beacon Fell woods and she was loth to part from it. However the dream, once broken, wouldn't return and she had to make a start on the day. Idly, she wondered what Jude was doing. She had talked about an early start; would she already be out pounding the beat? She and Jude had been together barely a week, and already she was beginning to hate the police shift system. Why couldn't Jude work a nine-to-five job like normal people? In just one short weekend she had got used to waking up next to someone and, right now, she felt alone, and wanted an early morning cuddle. Still, regrets wouldn't get her to work, so she slipped out of bed, grabbed her dressing gown and went down to the kitchen to make herself breakfast.

Breakfast over, she went to the bathroom and started her morning ablutions. When she looked in the bathroom mirror, to her consternation, she saw that she was still wearing the necklace. Over the weekend it had become part of her, it was what she wore and, the previous night, in her exhausted state, she had completely forgotten about the need to remove it before going to work. Suddenly it seemed unmissable, completely obvious to all and sundry. The side featuring the ornate 'k' was hardly innocent and the other side, with its clear statement that she was Jude's property, left nothing to the imagination. Urgently she pulled it round to look at the padlock but, as on Saturday, however she looked at it, it was staying firmly shut. It would appear that it was going to remain around her neck, and she surely couldn't go to work like that. She went down to the kitchen, found her handbag and, inside that, her mobile phone. Now that the question of what Jude was doing was no longer idle speculation, she needed her to come round and unlock the necklace and the sooner the better.

"Hi honey, good morning. What's up?" Jude sounded bright and sunny as she answered the phone.

"Jude, please, you've got to come round. I... We... I'm still wearing the necklace and you've got the only key. I've got to take it off before I go to work," Karen explained breathlessly.

"Oh dear," Karen could hear the amusement in Jude's voice, "that's going to be a bit difficult."

"Jude! Please don't muck around. Please, this is important."

"I'm not mucking around. It really is going to be difficult. At this moment I'm just approaching Wigan station on my way to a training course in Hendon. I'm away for the week, didn't I tell you?"

"Jude, please, stop joking," Karen said urgently.

"Honey, I'm not joking," and, right on cue, Karen heard the Tannoy in the background, as the conductor announced the arrival of the train at Wigan station. 

"What do I do?" Karen asked, close to tears.

"I'm not sure I know what to suggest," Jude replied, suddenly practical. "Look, I do understand and, if you feel you have to cut it then," Karen could hear Jude's sigh down the phone, "well, as I said, I'll understand."

"Cut it...?"

"Yeah, with pliers or some such. If you do one of the links round at the back then it shouldn't be too hard to get it fixed."

Karen was both relieved and horrified. It was easy to tell that the necklace was no cheap trinket; and here was Jude, however reluctantly, suggesting that she mutilate it. On the other hand she would at least be able to get to work.

"Thanks. Thanks Jude, I'll try not to do too much damage." Karen felt as if she could breathe again.

"See, told you I understood. So, did you sleep well?" Jude was obviously chatty.

"Like a baby. I did miss you though." Karen wasn't making this one up. It was strange how quickly she had become used to sleeping with Jude and, conversely, how alone she felt when Jude wasn't there.

"I had to catch the six thirty from Preston so it really wouldn't have worked out. You're going to have to miss me tonight as well, and every night until Friday."

"You should have told me." Karen was disappointed and couldn't keep the reprimand from her voice.

"Sorry, hun, I thought I had. Anyway I'll phone you often, starting with lunchtime today. I'm not sure when they'll let us out for lunch so it could be any time between twelve and one."

"I'll be waiting." Karen glanced at the clock. If she didn't hurry up she would be late and she had lost enough time fussing about the necklace. "Jude, I've got to go or I'll miss my bus."

"OK, just make sure you're waiting for my call later."

"Bye. I love you." 

There was a silence as they both realised what Karen had just said.

"I miss you too, honey," Jude replied eventually, "bye."

And with that the call was ended.

Karen now had to bustle about to get ready as time was getting on. The first thing she had to do was to deal with the necklace. She went down to the kitchen to find the pliers in the small box of tools she kept in the cupboard under the sink. She took them back to her dressing table and sat down. Once again she turned the necklace around until the clasp was at the front and, choosing a suitable link, manoeuvred the pliers around it. The gold of the necklace sparkled in the morning sunlight streaming in through the window. It really was a fine piece of jewellery, no cheap trinket, and it was almost criminal to treat it so. More than that, it felt as if by cutting the chain she'd also be cutting a link with Jude and she surely didn't want that. She started to squeeze the pliers but she couldn't go through with it, she simply couldn't. There had to be way that she could keep it whole; if she couldn't take it off maybe she could find something to hide it, a scarf, a polo neck sweater, anything. With a sigh she put down the pliers.

By now she really was running out of time.She was increasingly flustered as she went over to her wardrobe to search for something suitable. Urgently she riffled back and forth through her clothes until she found a blouse with a high neckline made of lace which seemed to fit the bill. She tried it on and found that, although you could still see the gold chain glinting through, it looked like any other necklace. The tag wasn't visible and she wasn't announcing her 'slavery' to all and sundry. The only problem was the conservative cut of the blouse. She looked like a librarian. And it wasn't just the blouse, her boring knee length skirt wasn't helping matters either. She looked back at her wardrobe and began to see it through Jude's eyes. Not only was there no other suitable blouse but everything item she owned was "sensible" and "practical". Years of clothes shopping that rated machine washability over style had taken their toll and she had nothing that could be considered 'sexy' or stylish. Even her Sunday best was just that, more suitable for going to church than for going out on a date. Nowadays she wanted to look her best, not for herself but for Jude, even if they weren't going to meet that day. Much as she desperately needed to update her collection she wondered how; she had never been any good at choosing clothes for herself.

And then there was the moot point of underwear. She'd omitted a bra when testing the blouse and it seemed silly to waste time taking it off just to put on a garment she wasn't sure she wanted to wear. As for panties, a certain amount of cramping from 'down there' told her that she'd soon be wearing them, Jude or no Jude but, for today, she'd dress the way her Mistress wanted her to, maybe tucking a spare pair in her handbag just in case. Finished at last, she grabbed her handbag and dashed for the bus stop barely in time to catch the eight twenty.

Half an hour later she was at her desk, early into the office despite the morning's delays. 

"Morning boss." Mel announced her arrival as she came through the door and, instead of going to her booth walked over to Karen's desk. 

"Good morning, Mel." Karen replied with a smile. She glanced at the clock on the wall. "Are you feeling OK? It's not like you to be on time to work."

"Hey, less of the cheek. Anyway my boss told me being late wasn't being fair on the others so I... well, here I am bright eyed and bushy tailed." Mel actually looked embarrassed. "Look, do me a favour and give my Lucy a call, will you. She's been on tenterhooks since Saturday and if she doesn't get all the goss soon she's going to explode. By the way, is that Jude's necklace I see peeking through your collar?"

"Is it... is it obvious?" Karen asked, reaching for her throat.

"Is it obvious you're wearing a necklace? Only if you look. Is it obvious you're wearing a 'slave' collar, nah, I only guessed what it was because I saw you wearing it on Saturday and I've never seen you in a high necked blouse before. I put two and two together and judging by your blushes it seems that I guessed right."

"Jude went off to Hendon for the week and I'm stuck with it," Karen confessed. "She's not back until Friday."

"Really! Wow, what a hoot!" Mel couldn't help but laugh. "Little miss prim and proper stuck with Jude's necklace all week. I hope you have enough high- necked blouses. I'm not sure you want this lot to find out that their boss wears a collar announcing that she's another woman's slave." 

Karen was a little taken aback to be described as 'little miss prim and proper' but she guessed she deserved it. However Mel's joking brought home to her how much she hadn't thought it through. She had been so pleased to have found something for that day she hadn't bargained on having to find something else for tomorrow and Wednesday, and Thursday and.... 

"Oh my gosh! I've only got this one blouse with a high neck. What am I going to do tomorrow, or Wednesday? I need to go shopping. I'll have to go after work. Would... would you help?" Karen was amazed at herself for even asking such a thing, but after Friday Mel didn't seem so distant, so aloof.

"Me! You're asking the wrong person. I'd be useless; I've no fashion sense at all. Why don't you ask Lucy? A bit of clothes shopping; she'll be in seventh heaven."

"Thanks, Mel. I'll do that." 

"Well, best be getting on. I don't want to upset the boss by being late to my desk." Mel gave a huge wink and turned towards her workstation. "And don't forget to call Lucy," she called over her shoulder as she left.

Lunchtime found Karen sitting in the park waiting for Jude's phone call. When it didn't come shortly after noon, Karen surmised that Jude wouldn't be free until twelve thirty and went to the&nbsp; corner shop to buy some sandwiches. She was just polishing them off when her mobile rang.

"So, did you cut the necklace off?" Jude asked after the usual greetings.

"No, I couldn't," Karen replied.

"Couldn't? What, didn't you have any pliers?"

"No, it wasn't like that, I just couldn't do it," Karen confessed. "It didn't seem right."

"Oh sweetie! So you're wearing it now?" Karen could almost feel Jude's smile down the phone.

"Yes. I found a suitable blouse, one with a high neck and...."

"And all those women you work with have no idea that their boss is sitting there wearing my slave collar." Karen could hear the amusement in Jude's voice. "How deliciously naughty! I'll bet they don't know you're knickerless either; you are knickerless, aren't you?"

"Yes, Mistress."

"I should jolly well hope so," Jude replied in mock severity. "Well, well, well, no panties and collared at work, there's a turn up for the books."

Karen wanted to tell Jude how much it meant to her to be wearing the necklace but Jude's frivolity made it difficult. It was like when the 'love' word had slipped out earlier and Jude had all but ignored it. Karen wondered just how much this was whether Jude wouldn't or couldn't be serious about their relationship.

"I miss you," she compromised. 

"I miss you too," Jude replied. "I'm stuck down here learning about crowd control during the day and I'll be all alone in a lousy hotel tonight. We're supposed to meet up and go out boozing but... a pub crawl with a bunch of coppers... I think I'll give it a miss. Mind you, I'm sure that if you were here with me we could find some ways to pass the time."

"I wish you'd told me you were going." 

"Sorry, I thought I had. Maybe you should give me a spanking when I get back to teach me not to be so forgetful."

"Jude!" Somehow the thought of spanking Jude just seemed so wrong.

"What?" Jude replied. "I'll always be your Mistress but it's fun to swap roles occasionally. Wouldn't you like to spank my tush?"

And so it continued. Jude was flirty and frivolous; making light of it all and having fun. Karen's mood was more sombre. She wanted to tell Jude what was in her heart but couldn't find the space. Jude's flippancy seemed to crowd out any chance of serious conversation. Was that just her way or was it how she really felt about their relationship? Karen had never meant to say 'I love you' but at least it gave some indication of how she felt; a little reciprocation wouldn't do any harm.

And, when the phone call was over, as she walked back to the office, Karen felt as if there was a distance between them, a distance that was more than just the physical two hundred miles that parted them. She had wanted to talk about their relationship and Jude had just wanted to flirt and tell her off for having no panties on. She was sure she was more than just a notch in Jude's bedpost-- but how much more? When the chips were down what did Jude want with her and, equally, what did she want from Jude? Karen had never felt this strongly about anyone before and she was scared to realisehow dependant she was becoming. 

And then there was the whole kinky sex thing. She remembered Frankie's words from the club. It was hard to tell how much Jude wanted her as a partner and how much Jude just wanted a playmate in the bedroom. One moment Jude was caring and compassionate; the next she was pressing her to go one step further than she wanted. How much would Jude tolerate it if she put up too much resistance? And, as Jude kept upping the ante, would they reach a breaking point? Would Jude get bored with her and look for someone more adventurous?

Karen reached for the necklace around her throat and told herself not to be so stupid. There was a closeness, a genuine connection between them. Anyway, on Sunday, she had accepted, albeit reluctantly, Karen's limits. This had to be more than just a fling. Just because Jude was slow to show her feelings didn't mean she didn't have any.

She was halfway back to the office when she remembered that she had yet to phone Lucy. She reached for her mobile and, as Mel had prophesied, Lucy was delighted at the prospect of going clothes shopping. Enthusiastically she suggested that they meet up in the St George's Mall after work. Most of the shops were open until eight, which would give them a couple of hours&#8217; shopping before, at Lucy's suggestion, having a bite together at the West Coast burger bar. Karen asked about where Mel would eat. Lucy replied firmly that 'she knows where the can opener is; she can look after herself for a change'.

So it was that at four forty-five Karen found Lucy waiting impatiently outside the main entrance to the mall. They had barely hugged their hellos before Lucy was demanding details of Karen's weekend with Jude. 

"And don't try and fob me off with coyness," Lucy demanded. "I want all the gory details, all the goss. After all, it's me that brought the two of you together so it's the least I deserve."

Karen was keen to talk. She had much on her mind and she had found Lucy to be the best sort of listener. However, walking around the shops wasn't the place to try to explain the ins and outs of her concerns, so she asked if they could wait until they stopped to eat. Lucy was torn between her love of shopping and her desire to hear all the gossip, but time was running out so they headed off into the mall.

Lucy, like Jude, had no time for Marks and Sparks or British Home Stores, let alone Primark, but headed straight for the boutiques aimed at the younger market. Karen started to protest but Lucy was adamant and firmly insistent. She scoured the racks, picking out item after item before heading for the changing rooms. Karen couldn't believe that this young and trendy selection was intended for her until a 'come along then' made her realise that Lucy was waiting for her at the changing rooms. Together they squeezed into a cubicle and Karen tried on the first blouse.

Lucy was a harsh critic and Karen had to try on several blouses before they found one that reached her high standards. Karen felt that most of Lucy's choices were too young and too frivolous, especially for office wear. She was, after all, the supervisor and was expected to look the part. Lucy, on the other hand, had other ideas and all Karen's objections were just brushed aside. Finally Lucy deemed one of the blouses acceptable but when Karen looked at herself in the mirror....

"I can't wear this, you can see my nipples!" she exclaimed.

"No you can't, well, not much anyway, not unless you're looking for them," Lucy replied. "Anyway it looks perfect on you and it covers the necklace well." 

Despite her qualms Karen had to admit that the cut of the blouse was flattering to her figure, making the most of what breasts she had. 

"OK, we'll take it," Karen conceded at last. "If we get three more of these then we're done."

"Three more of the same? Are you crazy?" Lucy was horrified. "There's a whole mall full of stuff out there and you want four identical blouses! Not while I'm in charge."

Again Karen found out just how much Lucy was in charge. Once she had got the shopping bug Lucy was unstoppable.&nbsp; Before they were done they must have been to every store in the mall and it was nigh on eight o'clock. Karen had never in her life bought so much in one go but she had to admit that, with Lucy's guidance, she had gone a long way to revolutionising her wardrobe. Along with the blouses had come matching skirts and a dress, all of which were far trendier than Karen was used to. Famished and laden down with shopping bags, the two exhausted women made their way to The West Coast burger bar and settled into a booth.

"OK, I've waited long enough. I want to know every detail. Last thing I saw was you chasing after Jude as she left the Adelphi. I gather you caught up with her. What did she say?"

Prompted by Lucy, Karen told all about how she had made up with Jude, how they had spent Saturday night together and how they had gone to Beacon Fell on Sunday. Lucy wouldn't settle for less than all the details and, somehow, it helped Karen to talk about them. In particular discussing the various games they had played as if they were completely normal helped Karen to allay her ever- present concerns about what she was getting involved with. Years of 'nice girls don't do that' were being eroded by the plain and simple fact that Lucy, evidently a nice girl, did do that. Sure, Karen was still having problems seeing the person before her as the same person who would gleefully submit to anal rape, but there she was discussing how much stinging nettles hurt and the times she had had it done to her. Lucy made her friend gasp with a story of when Mel had used stinging nettles between her legs and it had all been a bit too much. "That's where Beth comes in handy. It's useful having a doctor as a friend. She's the one that recommended using antihistamines. Anyway, as far as I'm concerned, half the fun of stinging nettle play is using the cream afterwards." 

"So, this training course she's on," Lucy continued. "When's she back?"

"Friday, but I'm not sure what time," Karen replied. "About Friday...."

"Looking forward to it, are you?"

"Well, it's a bit difficult." 

"How so?" Lucy was concerned by her friend's obvious nervousness. "What's the problem?"

"Lucy, when you and Beth... I mean... when she... when you... Look, I can't...."

"You can't what?" Lucy asked gently.

"It's the group sex thing. OK, call me a prude but I can't get off on it. It doesn't feel right."

"So you don't want us to come back after the club?"

"Of course I do! I want you all to come and I don't even mind us all being naked except... well, I'm not happy making love with anyone else but Jude," Karen said quite firmly. 

"I'm not sure that what we do on Friday evenings comes under the heading of 'making love'," Lucy said thoughtfully. "Making love is what Mel and I do when we're alone together. Friday nights are more about having fun with a few close friends."

"Please, Lucy," Karen was getting quite upset by her friend's apparent lack of understanding. "A couple of weeks ago I'd never been in any sort of relationship and, for sure, no one had ever seen me naked. I certainly never even dreamed I'd be... be... doing the things we do. Now, all of a sudden, I'm having a hard enough time coming to terms with the fact my boyfriend is a girlfriend. I'm trying to be open-minded but... the whole group sex thing is too much for me. I'm sorry, I really am, but I can't help the way I feel."

"Hey, it's OK," Lucy replied, concerned at the growing anxiety evident on Karen's face. "Look, we all have limits and we all respect each other. No one's going to make you do anything you don't want to. It's going to make things a little complicated but we'll work round it. Shame though, I was looking forward to kissing that pretty little pussy of yours."

"Lucy!" Karen was horrified. "That's exactly what I mean. I don't feel happy with anybody touching me like that, well, anyone but Jude."

"OK, OK, I was only joking. Seriously, everyone is really pleased that Jude has found somebody and we love having you as our friend. We'll work it out, one way or another. You may find that Andy has one or two things to say but that's just her way. She's really nice once you get to know her."

"Oh, and there's another thing...."

"Another thing?" Lucy asked.

"It's my time of the month. I may not be ready for any sexy stuff by Friday; I'll probably still be a bit yucky."

"Come on, we're all girls together, we all understand that one. It comes up all the time. There are plenty of ways you can still join in, if you want to. If you don't then, well, we'll miss you but we'll understand."

"Thanks, Lucy, thank you for being so understanding." Karen was relieved that her fears were being allayed. 

"Hey, don't be silly," Lucy replied. "It's great to have you with us." She reached over and gave Karen a hug. "Oh! Am I still allowed to do that?" she joked.

Karen blushed but didn't push Lucy away.

That night Karen and Jude spent hours on the phone just chatting. Karen was keen to tell all about how she had gone shopping with Lucy and Jude seemed keen to listen. Indeed, when Jude finally brought the call to an end Karen was amazed to find out how late it was. As she took herself off to bed she felt a bit happier than she had earlier. Jude had been understanding, compassionate, loving. OK, so, naturally, there had been some sexy flirting, it wouldn't be Jude without, but Karen had felt more like a partner and less like a one night stand.

And, as she tidied up the house and got ready for bed, she realised how much she was missing Jude. Her house, her little house, for so long her safe little hideaway, now felt empty. She felt an almost physical need to have Jude there, to look after her, to pamper her, to be her helpmeet and then, later, it would be Jude's turn to do the looking after.

Monday turned into Tuesday turned into Wednesday and, as the week passed, Karen found she was looking more and more towards the weekend. Jude had confirmed that they usually got let out of the course around midday, which meant she could catch the two o'clock from Euston and be home in time for the evening meal. Jude told Karen that she would pick her up from her house and that they would go out to eat together before going on to the club. Karen noted that, as ever, Jude was taking charge and making decisions for both of them. However she didn't demur.

All the while Karen was finding that there were subtle changes happening at work. On Tuesday, the first day in the new clothes she had purchased with Lucy, she had felt nervous when she looked at herself in the mirror before setting off but, once she got used to it, she found herself walking taller and more confidently. She got an extra boost when Mel came in.

"Hello, sexy," she said as she came over to Karen's desk.

"Do I... do I look OK?" Karen replied uncertainly.

"If I weren't in a committed relationship...," Mel started but, seeing the look on Karen's face, she quickly backed off with, "Only joking." And, with a quick wink, went off to her desk.

For all her boost in confidence, came the weekly staff meeting, there were still enough trouble makers among her staff to ensure that she had little respect and, once again, she found herself tongue tied. She tried to make a plea about following the rules on smoking breaks but it was pretty feeble and, as soon as the meeting was over, she saw them going off, flaunting the rules as ever. As she put together the weekly performance statistics, again there was no improvement and she knew she was in for a hard time from Susan, her supervisor.

And then, at last it was Friday. Karen felt on a high all day. In a matter of a few hours she would be seeing Jude again and the very thought made her heart sing. It felt good to feel good; after all the years of loneliness the anticipation of being with someone special was a new feeling. It wasn't just that she was no longer dreading the long lonely weekends, she knew that in a few short hours she'd be with Jude and that was all she wanted.

"Morning, Boss," Mel said as she came in the office. "Someone's in a good mood this morning. Would that have anything to do with a certain police constable returning home?"

Karen just smiled, blushing slightly.

"Looking forward to some hot sex tonight, are we?" Mel went on as she came over to chat.

"Please, Mel!" Karen said aghast. "Keep your voice down. Anyway I can't; I've got my monthlies."

For a moment they just paused, each amazed that Karen had been so candid.

"I'm sorry; I didn't mean to embarrass you." Karen started.

"Hey, it's OK, really." Mel reassured her. "You'd need to do far more than that to embarrass me. Remember, I've seen you naked."

Karen and Mel looked at each other and burst out laughing. There was something about her down-to-earth ways and her no nonsense language that made Mel refreshing and good to have around. Karen remembered that she had originally been scared of her. Now there was something more like mutual respect.

And then, as soon as it was four-thirty, Karen was off, back home and straight up to her bedroom to get ready. She had a quick bath and then went to her dressing table to put on her makeup and do her hair. She wanted to look her best, she wanted to look pretty; she wanted to be everything that Jude desired. She ran her fingers through her hair; there was nothing wrong with it per se but it was so dull. There wasn't much she could do about the colour but the cut was as boring as her clothes had been before Lucy had had her way. Still, she would do what she could.

She put on the dress that Jude had given her. Its open neckline showed off the necklace but, now she was not at work, this was what she wanted. She was proud to announce to the world that she was Jude's. As she sat at her dressing table brushing her hair, she could see the dog tag glinting. For all her fears that it seemed to scream out to the world her perverse and degraded status, she was stuck with it. If she were being realistic, she had to admit that you had to look quite closely to read the words on the tag and, around town of an evening, she'd be safe with Jude.

Her phone burst into life and the screen showed '1 message received'. It was, inevitably, from Jude saying that she was just setting off and would arrive in ten minutes. Karen's heart raced. She fussed around the house tidying, rearranging, anything until, finally, there was a knock on the door and, through the frosted glass she could see the figure of her lover. She rushed down the hallway, opened the door and let her in.

Jude grabbed Karen, pushed her back into the house, spinning her against the wall and pinning her there. Without a single word she took Karen's face in her hands and kissed her long and hard. Then Jude gathered her in and Karen felt her knees weaken as Jude's strong arms took her, held her, squeezed her. She felt herself surrender, she gave herself up and let Jude do her will. However as Jude reached for the hem of her dress, as her hand moved up Karen's thigh, reality returned.

"You're wearing panties. Have you been a naughty girl or does that mean that...?" Jude let the question hang.

"Sorry," Karen replied. "Aunty Flo is in town. Maybe tomorrow."

"Oh well. It doesn't stop me kissing you." Jude led Karen into the lounge, laid her on the sofa and climbed on top. "God I've missed you," she sighed before showing how much in more physical ways. It was a full half hour before they broke apart.&nbsp; 

"I hope you're hungry," Jude said. "There's a new Italian just off the Fishergate. I've booked for seven thirty."

"Seven thirty? But it's only just gone six now." Karen responded. "What shall we do in the meantime?"

"I'm sure I'll think of something. Now where were we?" She said as she resumed kissing.

It was almost time to go when Jude finally released Karen from her clutches and Karen nearly panicked when she saw herself in the mirror over the fireplace. Her hair was all over the place and, as for her makeup; it needed reapplying from scratch. Despite Jude's impatience, Karen insisted on going up to her room to repair the damage until, at last, they set off for town.

Karen felt as if she was walking on air. Maybe it was the way Jude looked at her and fussed over her but she felt pretty as a picture in her new dress and shoes and, hand in hand with her lover, she was proud and happy as they made their way to the restaurant and later on to the club. And then, when they got there, she was now part of the crowd, greeted with warmth and friendliness. For the first time in ages she felt as if she belonged.









It was about ten thirty when Sarah turned to the assembled company and said "Well, ladies, I think I'm about ready for a little more privacy; shall we?" The Dommes all agreed, and Jude took this a cue to phone for a taxi. They all finished their drinks and trooped outside to wait. Karen was concerned that, somehow, the others would feel that she'd let them down; she had been brought up to believe that her 'monthlies' were one of the great unmentionables and she still felt uncomfortable having to explain why she wouldn't be joining in. Jude, in her usual forthright manner, simply stated quite openly that Karen was 'off games', but would be their serving wench for the evening.

When they arrived at Jude's house, Karen and Kathy were sent to the kitchen to organise drinks whilst the others went downstairs to the cellar.

"Watch out for the boss tonight," Kathy said casually as she slipped off her dress, folded it neatly and draped it over the back of a chair. "You're not the only one 'on the blob' and it's making her cranky. I'll give a pound to a penny I'm in for a sore bottom before we're finished."

"Doesn't that bother you?" Karen asked, as she concentrated on pouring out the beers. Even now she found it difficult to accept how easily her new-found friends disrobed in front of each other. She found she wanted to both stare and turn her eyes away.

"How do you mean? Why should it bother me?"

"That she takes her frustration out on you. That seems unfair to me."

"If it helps her feel better then that's what I'm here for," Kathy remonstrated. "Anyway, who says I won't enjoy it?"

"Enjoy a spanking, enjoy getting a sore bottom?" Karen asked.

"Well, I wouldn't have stayed with her all these years if I didn't, would I? You know what they say, no pain, no gain." Kathy gave Karen a broad wink. "Now we'd best get this lot downstairs soonest. It pays not to give them too many excuses." And with that they were off down to the cellar.

When they got there they found the layout was much as it had been the previous week. The four Dommes were sat with Lucy and Beth, both now naked, knelt at their feet. Karen and Kathy handed round the drinks before joining Lucy and Beth on the floor. Karen suddenly felt conspicuously overdressed.

For a while there was general chat, much the same as there had been in the club, except that the subs were expected to keep silent except when asked a question. However it didn't take long before, as Kathy had predicted, Sarah decided to move things on a bit.

"This little thing has had an attitude problem. She's been behaving like a spoilt little brat all day, haven't you?" She said in an off-hand manner, as she ruffled her hand through Kathy's hair.

"Yes, Mistress," Kathy answered meekly. "I'm sorry, Mistress"

"It's no good being sorry," Sarah went on. "I've had more than enough of your back-chat and general insolence. Once again I find I need to teach you a lesson. You deserve to be punished, don't you?"

"Yes, Mistress." Kathy sounded genuinely contrite. "Please punish your naughty little girl and help her behave better in future."

However, although Kathy's contrition seemed genuine, Karen could tell that this litany was well practiced, that this was far from the first time that Kathy had 'asked' to be punished.

"Very well then. Mistress Mel, Mistress Andy, perhaps you would do me the favour of ordering your subs to get the horse ready and get this one suitably arranged for punishment."

"Of course," the two Mistresses replied and, without the need for further prompting, Lucy and Beth got up off the floor and went to fetch the horse. Again there was a sense of ritual as they positioned it to Sarah's requirements. Then they went over to Kathy and, each taking a hand, led her over to the horse, helping her position herself lengthways along the top with her backside pointing towards the thrones. Lucy and Beth attached Kathy's wrists and ankles to the cuffs, which were then adjusted so that Kathy was at full stretch and wide open with her ability to move very much restricted. Now Karen could see exactly how the top of the horse functioned. The ridge of leather was forced between her legs and pressed hard against her sensitive flesh. Each and every movement she made would rub directly on her centre. As Karen watched, Kathy flexed her thighs to settle herself down and ensure she was positioned properly, barely hiding the sexual aspect of what was happening. Now that she was fastened, Lucy and Beth turned towards Mistress Sarah, gave a little curtsey and went back to kneel beside their respective Dommes.

Mistress Sarah got up from her chair and went to the other part of the basement, returning with a riding crop. The one she had chosen, unlike the ones Karen had seen before, was the real deal and did not end in the square of leather. She went over to the bound Kathy and stroked her along her back, making the bound woman give a little shudder.

"Well, slave, have you been a naughty little girl?" Sarah started.

"Yes, Mistress."

"And how have you been a naughty little girl? Tell the others, tell them how bad you were."

"I was disrespectful, Mistress. I didn't show Mistress the deference she deserves," Kathy replied.

"No, you most certainly did not. You were an uppity little tart, weren't you?"

"Yes, Mistress."

"And now you expect me to punish you, to help you improve. Why should I bother with such a disobedient little girl?"

Karen watched fascinated as Sarah and Kathy went through this ritual, for ritual it surely was. While Kathy was acting the naughty little girl confessing her sins, Sarah's fingers stroked her back, her buttocks and her inner thighs. Kathy was making little pretence about what this was doing for her. She was using what little movement she had to flex her thigh muscles, working herself against the ridge in the top of the horse. Even from where she was knelt, Karen could see the glistening juices that spoke of Kathy's arousal. Although the signs were far less obvious, Karen could tell that Mistress Sarah too was getting more and more worked up. There was a sparkle in her eyes that belied the mock annoyance of the school-ma'am character she was playing. 

"...and for that reason I'm going to thrash you until, this time, you understand the folly of your ways," Mistress Sarah concluded and, without further ado, she slashed the crop across Kathy's waiting backside.

However much the lead-up might have been role play, Kathy's cry of pain was all too real, as was her next and her next as, slowly, systematically, Mistress Sarah laid into her with the crop, leaving a pattern of parallel red stripes from the crown of her buttocks down to around mid thigh. Karen's emotions were in turmoil; this was far more severe than she had ever witnessed before. Kathy's cries went straight to her heart. Part of her wanted to step in and intervene but, not only was it not her place, she had to remember that Kathy, for all her evident distress, was far from being an unwilling participant. Furthermore, for all that Karen had been brought up to believe that hurting people was wrong, there was no denying the eroticism of what was happening. Karen glanced across at the others; all eyes were watching closely. Andy had reached down and was holding Beth close, stroking her neck in time to the thrashing. Lucy, her head resting against Mel's legs, had her hand quite blatantly between her thighs, and Jude too had reached for Karen, putting her hand on her shoulder and kneading it. Everyone there was feeling the tension.

As Karen reached her climax all pretence fell away. She was now rubbing herself furiously against the horse and gasping between her sobbing. Then she flung back her head, gave an almost animal cry and her whole body went rigid, locking her against the horse. Sarah put down the crop and leant over Kathy, hugging her tight. Kathy's tears ran freely as, completely overwhelmed, she rode out her climax. Sarah cuddled and babied her until, finally, she started to relax again. Karen breathed again. She suddenly realised she had been holding her breath. Emotionally, she, along with all the others, had followed every nuance of Kathy's climax and, now it was all over, she could feel a collective sigh run round the room.

Once Kathy had got her breath back, Sarah reached down and undid the cuffs so that she was able to slide off the horse. Kathy was still shaking and needed all of Sarah's support as they hugged and kissed. They broke apart and, for a moment or two, just looked at each other, their shared gaze full of love and caring. Karen saw Sarah mouth the work 'OK' and Kathy gave a nod in return. Sarah returned to her throne, reached for her drink, downed it in one and handed the empty glass to her sub.

"Well, that didn't touch the sides. It looks like I need a refill," she commented. 

"Would any other Mistress like a top up?" Kathy asked the group, her voice still a little breathless. 

There was a general assent, and Kathy was sent off to the kitchen with Karen assisting.&nbsp; As soon as they reached the kitchen, Kathy went to the sink where there was a bottle of hand cream. She handed it to Karen, turned and gripped the taps so that her battered backside was presented to the kitchen.

"Be a darling, would you?" she asked. Karen realised what was wanted. She squeezed a generous dollop of the cream onto her fingertips, stood behind Kathy and, gently, eased the cream across the battered flesh.

"God that's good," Kathy sighed. Her hands gripped the taps, whitening her knuckles, and she stood on tiptoe. "Yes, like that, a little more please."

"Are you OK?" Karen asked. Now she was close up she could see just how harsh Mistress Sarah had been. Even though Karen was being as gentle as possible Kathy was wincing in pain as her fingers touched the vivid red lines across her backside.

"Well, I'm a little sore. Mistress Sarah has a strong right arm," Kathy said with a little laugh. "But I'm fine, really I am. There's nothing like well thrashed buttocks to make a girl feel so goddam horny." With no sense that she was doing anything out of the ordinary, and with Karen still massaging the cream into her backside, Kathy rubbed her groin against the edge of the work surface. "Ooh but she knows how to turn me on." She sighed before reluctantly letting go of the taps and turning around. "If we don't stop now then I'm going to come again and that would never do. Come along, we'd best get these drinks sorted."

Both women washed their hands under the tap before starting on the drinks. Kathy fetched the wine bottle whilst Karen fetched a couple of beers from the fridge, opened them and poured them into tumblers. From the corner of her eye she watched her friend working her buttocks as the pain from her rear settled down. Her own emotions were still a tangled mess. She was still a little taken aback by the ferocity of the thrashing, but there was no denying it had affected her deeply. There was something about the intensity of the shared experience. She wanted to go over and give Kathy a hug but she felt it would be misinterpreted. Anyway there was no time; they had to get back to the playroom with the drinks.

When they got downstairs there was a certain amount of muttering about how long they had taken but it wasn't serious. After they had handed round the drinks, Karen noticed that Kathy, rather than kneeling on the floor, was now nestled into Mistress Sarah's lap. There was a closeness about them that had been missing earlier. Whatever the price in bruised backsides Karen could see that the punishments were an important part of how they bonded.

"Now that's out of the way," Andy started, "how about a little challenge, Beth against Lucy, see who has the most self control?"

"Suits me," Mel replied. "What exactly did you have in mind?"

"Jude, have you got that box I dropped by the other day?"

"Yeah, it's in the other room. Karen, it's a polished wooden box on the workbench, go and fetch it." 

When Karen got to the workbench it was quite obvious which box Jude meant, so she picked it up and took it back to Andy.

"This little beauty," Andy opened the box to show the others, "was made around the turn of the century. It's supposed to be a cure for the vapours in young girls who were prone to hysterics. All stuff and nonsense, of course, but it does have certain practical applications. I picked this one up in an antique shop in town and, believe me, it's fully functional."

With the box now open the others could see what it contained. There was some sort of cylinder and, there were two metal handles attached by long wires. Andy offered the handles to Jude and, as soon as she had taken them, she flicked some sort of switch on the box, which immediately started buzzing.

"Jesus!" Jude cried flinging the handles from her.

"Oops. Did I have it set a bit high? Here, try again." Andy adjusted the machine and Jude leant forward. She gingerly used the tips of her fingers to pick up the cylinders from the floor where they had fallen.

"That's quite pleasant, actually," Jude said as she held the two handles. "That's nice and tingly. So, you can adjust the voltage then?"

"That's the idea, anything from barely noticeable up to... well, it wasn't on full power when you dropped them! More than that, apart from those handles it has certain other attachments. Let me show you." She switched off the machine, and lifted it out of the box to reveal an inner compartment where various chrome shapes lay. She fetched out two cylinders each around six inches long and an inch in diameter.

"Is those what I think they are?" asked Mel. Andy just grinned and nodded as she handed it over for closer inspection.&nbsp; 

"So the Victorians cured the vapours by applying electric shocks to their pussies. Kinky little beasts, weren't they? Anyway, what's your plan?" Mel looked intrigued.

"Well, let's say we have the two subs knelt down facing each other. We fit them with one of these each, front or back, whichever you prefer. Then, as long as they don't touch they'll be fine, there's no circuit, see? However if they were to touch each other, lets say they were to kiss each other, then the circuit would be completed and this little box of tricks could do its stuff."

"And you keep upping the voltage and the first sub to pull back loses, is that it?" Mel asked, turning the metal cylinder over and over as she inspected it.

"That's the one," Andy confirmed.

"What's the prize?" Jude asked.

"I hadn't really thought that far."

"How about the winning sub gets to fuck the losing sub's Domme?" Mel suggested.

"I'm not sure...,"Andy replied.

"Not sure you're going to win? Not sure you trust Beth to pull through for you? Scaredy cat, scaredy cat," Mel taunted.

"OK, then," Andy conceded, not wanting to lose face. "Let's get on with it then."

Lucy and Beth knelt down on the floor opposite each other. Each of the cylinders was wired to the machine and then passed to the subs. Lucy sucked hers like a lollypop so as to make it suitably wet before reaching down and slipping it inside her. Beth followed suit and they reached forward and kissed.

"Proper kisses, tongues and all," Andy urged but, truth be told, they didn't need much encouraging and were soon locked in an embrace. Andy reached for the machine, set the voltage to a minimum and switched it on.

At first you couldn't tell that anything was that different but, as Andy slowly increased the voltage, you could see that the two women were becoming increasingly affected and, after one boost to the voltage, Lucy in particular gave a shudder, and a squeak escaped from her lips. Both started to squirm about as if trying to expel the invader in their groins but afraid to do so. At the urging of the others Andy was slow to increase the voltage. They were obviously enjoying watching the girls as they fought their conflicting desires. And then, as Andy turned the knob one last time, it was Beth who broke away, who pushed Lucy from her and reached down to take the cylinder from where it lay inside her.

"I'm sorry, Mistress, so sorry, so so sorry," Beth sobbed. "I just... god that's...," she reached down and rubbed herself, "that box is evil!"

"We'll discuss how sorry you are later," Andy said dryly. "Seeing as it's I who will be paying the price for your weakness."

Mel looked on delightedly as Lucy, also shaking like a leaf, reached for her cylinder, withdrew it, and held it to her lips where she licked it clean.

"Well, never let it be said I don't pay my debts. How do you want me?" Andy asked Mel.

"Nothing too fancy, hands and knees on the floor will do, naked of course," Mel replied.

Andy tidied away the electric shock machine, and then stood up and started to disrobe. Although she was making much of how Beth would pay for putting her through this, Karen could tell that mostly this was bluster, and when she was down to her underwear a little damp patch on her panties told its own story. When she was fully naked she knelt down on the floor leaning forward so that her backside was prominent. 

"Please, Mistress Mel, you are a worthy winner and I offer myself to your sub as your reward," Andy said from where she knelt.

Mel got up and went through to the other room returning with a strap-on. Karen was hardly an expert on sizes but this one seemed to be pretty large. Mel fitted it to Lucy and had Lucy kneel down behind Andy's prostrate form. 

"Let's see, do we need any lubrication?" Mel asked lightly as she reached between Andy's thighs. She brought her fingers out glistening with Andy's juices, which she showed to the others before licking her fingers clean. "No, indeed. Mistress 'high and mighty' is quite ready to be fucked, isn't that so."

"Yes, Mistress," Andy replied.

And with that Mel put one hand on the dildo part of the strap on and the other on Lucy's backside so as to guide her forward.&nbsp; The dildo slid home with a long smooth motion, causing Andy to moan gently. Then, with the others looking on, Lucy put her hands on Andy's buttocks and began slowly, steadily, sensuously moving back and forth. Both women were already aroused by what had gone before, and it wasn't long before Lucy was working the strap-on to a crescendo. As Karen watched she saw Andy's fingers grip the carpet and Lucy too had a far away look.

It was Andy who broke first. With a cry of "Harder! Fuck me! For gods sake you little bitch, fuck me harder!" she pushed herself back at Lucy, impaling herself time and time again on the dildo until, sated and satisfied, she slumped forward and lay flat on the floor, leaving Lucy still kneeling between her outstretched legs.

"Well, Mistress Andy, are you well and truly fucked?" Mel asked, once Andy had got her breath back.

"Yes, Mistress Mel, thank you Mistress Mel," Andy replied.

"And what about my sub? Is it fair that the loser should get to come when the winner is still unsatisfied?" Mel continued.

"No, of course not." 

Andy got back onto her hands and knees, turned round and reached for the straps around Lucy's waist. As soon as they were free, Lucy lay back on the floor and Andy buried her head between Lucy's thighs. Karen was utterly surprised. Here was the most dominant of all the Dommes debasing herself to service a sub... but no one else seemed to think it was out of the ordinary. There was even a little cheer as Lucy climaxed and, after a moment or two, it was all back to normal.

"That's an interesting box of tricks you've got there," Sarah commented as she looked through the attachments. "Where did you say you got it?"

"The antique shop in King Street," Andy replied, putting on a dressing gown that Beth had fetched for her. "I saw it in the window and couldn't resist. I'm sure we'll find lots of ways to put it to good use."

There were laughs all round at this.

And then the evening just seemed to drift away. It wasn't long before Sarah and Kathy called for the first taxi and the others followed soon after. Even so it was well gone midnight when a weary Jude led an even wearier Karen up to bed. 

And this set the pattern for the following weeks. More and more, as far as police shift patterns allowed, Karen was spending her time with Jude. Friday nights, whenever possible, were spent at the club and later back at the playroom. There was a certain amount of grumbling, notably from Andy and Sarah, about Karen's refusal to join in group activities but it was good natured and they accepted Karen's limits as part of the way she was. Andy's electric shock machine quickly became a favourite, especially when Kathy turned up with a pair of nipple clamps with suitable wires attached. Karen, along with the other subs, soon discovered what it was like to be on the cross or on the dentist whilst the various Dommes played with the voltage levels.

Gradually Karen was growing more comfortable with her new life. She still wasn't "out" in any real sense of the word, but the comfort she found in Jude's arms, whether or not sex was involved, made it increasingly hard to find anything wrong with loving another woman. Similarly, in her more introspective moments, she wondered just how it was that she was accepting more and more a sex life that was so unlike anything she would have dreamed of. Not so very long ago, if you'd have asked her about playing submissive games in a lesbian relationship, she would have called it perverse, sick, abnormal or simply refused to think about it. Now, well, it wasn't just the amazing orgasms, but there was something about submitting to Jude, something about being her sub, where the capitulation was more than just role play and had an almost mystical element. 

And it wasn't just in bed that their relationship was maturing. Increasingly Karen wanted to be Jude's wife. Cooking her meals and tending to her needs was fulfilling a need deep within her. She felt wanted, useful, appreciated in a way that she hadn't felt even when her parents were alive; indeed, even when she was acting as Jude's sub, it made a pleasant change not to be taken for granted.

For Jude things were not quite so straightforward. Sure she was fast becoming used to having a 'wife' around the place; Karen's cooking, if nothing else, was a big improvement on what had gone before, but she couldn't help but feel uneasy. Karen kept dropping hints, increasingly heavy hints, that she'd like to... well, not exactly move in, although Jude was sure that Karen would say yes to that in a heartbeat, but that she'd like, well, some cupboard space. Although, on the face of it, this was quite reasonable, Jude felt that Karen simply couldn't understand, it was all too recent, it was all too soon after... well, after Sharon.&nbsp; Letting someone into your house meant letting them further into your life than is safe. Give someone the power to hurt you and pain invariably follows. Much as she liked having Karen around, much as they really seemed to work well together, the scars around her heart were too fresh, too new, too raw. She would stick to her resolve never, ever, to get caught like that again.

And sometimes she felt smothered, suffocated. It seemed to Jude that Karen was foolishly rushing headlong into whatever it was she wanted them to have together. She was always going on about how happy she was and how this happiness all came from Jude. It was all too much, too much responsibility, too much obligation. Karen was always so keen to please that she demanded that Jude make all the decisions. While this was right and proper for a D/s relationship, sometimes it would be nice if... but that would involve opening herself up, laying herself bare.

And then there were the changes in Karen. She was dressing better, holding herself better, even being more assertive. This was changing things. She wasn't the scared little thing she had first met. What had started as a bit of fun with this little mouse had developed into something far, far more complex.

And then, bang in the middle of all this, was the incident in town. She and Karen had gone shopping together and, right in the main concourse of St George's Mall, they had bumped into Karen's sister. All morning Karen had been in a touchy, feely mood and, even as they went round the shops, Karen had insisted on holding hands. Then, as soon as she had spotted her sister, Karen had dropped Jude's hand like it was rancid. She had barely introduced Jude, pushing her into the background and referring to her simply as 'a friend'. Jude was used to those in the closet, but Karen had seemed almost embarrassed at Jude's existence. Karen's sister had mentioned a forthcoming wedding with a 'you'll be there, of course' and, whilst Karen had readily agreed to this, she had in no way suggested that, maybe, Jude might wish to accompany her. For the rest of the day their relationship had been strained. Jude knew that Karen had completely failed to understand how much she had been hurt.

And all the while, in the background, she felt she was getting pressure from the others. Karen's pathetic limits, her refusal to get fully involved, made life difficult, especially as the girls liked a little mix-and-match to liven things up. Andy, in particular, was, as ever, never slow to make her feelings known and phrases such as 'when are you going to get that little sub of yours in line' didn't help much.

Jude, whilst she agreed in many ways, wouldn't break her promise to Karen, so she urged patience upon her friends. Karen was still very new to the lifestyle and expecting her to throw herself headlong into it right from the start was asking a bit much. "Just stay with it for a while," Jude pleaded, "and let her find herself; give it time and she'll come to realise how unreasonable she was being."

With life getting increasingly complex and with the frustrations growing, Jude wondered just why her life revolved around the times Karen came to stay. If only Karen would just relax a bit, if only she would learn to join in, if only she wouldn't run so hot and cold, wanting Jude and her to be more than they were yet refusing to admit the slightest hint of closeness to her family. 

So, driven to distraction by this woman who, with her funny little ways had somehow turned her life upside down, Jude simply pushed all decisions off 'till another day, even if, in the small hours of a night shift, the questions returned to trouble her like picked onions eaten in haste.









As so often happens, the trouble, when it came, was a combination of little things that built and built. Jude had come off a punishing shift schedule to be told that, despite passing all her exams with flying colours, what with the recruitment freeze and all, there would be no promotion to sergeant in the current fiscal&nbsp; year. She returned to her desk, where a pile of paperwork waited for her, wondering why she put up with it all, the stupid hours, the abuse from the public she was only trying to protect, the lack of respect from the male police officers, and now this kick in the face. Really, why did she bother?

When she got back home she flopped down exhausted on the sofa. All she wanted was to get into her pyjamas, take herself up to bed, curl up under the covers, and hide away for a while. She needed a cuddle; she needed, just this once, to be the one protected, not the protector. However, as a Domme, she was supposed to be the one doing the cuddling. To admit to Karen just how much she needed her would be an act of weakness, which would undermine her position. She sighed as she looked at her watch. Time was getting on, and she was supposed to pick up Karen. But the thought of slogging all the way across town and back didn't help her mood in the slightest. She just wanted to sit there, but she'd made promises, she'd made arrangements and, as ever, people were relying on her. 'Why is always me that does the heavy lifting?' she asked herself.

Halfway across town she got caught up in emergency sewer works on Fowler Street. The ensuing chaos and confusion was not helped by two drivers who, by trying to push through the same gap, had had a minor collision. They had nearly come to blows before the police had stepped in and told them to move their cars. Bloody motorists, Jude thought, not for the first time. Why, oh, why couldn't they just co-operate? The net result was that the area all around the bus station was completely gridlocked and, although she knew most of the coppers who were trying to sort it out, it still took nearly thirty minutes to drive little more than a couple of miles, and her temper suffered further as a result.

As her car pulled up outside Karen's house, she came bounding out with a big smile on her face and a spring in her step. She threw her overnight bag on the back seat, got into the car, reached across and gave Jude a peck on the cheek. Normally this would have been just the thing to raise Jude's spirits, but she had reached that point in her cycle of depression where other people's good moods just contrasted with her own and made everything worse. And while they headed back to Jude's house, this time carefully avoiding the town centre, Karen's cheerful chatter was, to Jude's ears, inane wittering, and she felt as if she was getting a headache. When they returned, Jude pointedly sat in the lounge whilst Karen cooked supper in the kitchen and, when Karen called her to the table, she sat over her meal in sullen silence.

At the club it was hardly any better. Jude seemed to sink her first pint almost before they had sat down. Before any of the others had finished their first, she was sending Karen to the bar for a refill and, when Andy gently commented that she was drinking a lot, she got told to mind her own business. By the time they were ready to leave Jude had sunk four pints Again Andy enquired gently if she felt that she was in the right mood for "playtime".

"What's got into you tonight?" Jude snarled. "Just because I want a drink or two for a change, you come on like I'm a right dipso."

"I'm just saying...." Andy started but then backed off as Jude gave her look that would have scorched paintwork. 

There was an uneasy air in the cab to Jude's house and, when they arrived the atmosphere was forced. Karen was ordered rather nastily to go to the kitchen and sort out the drinks; Jude once again ordering beer. And then, when Karen brought the tray downstairs, she was so apprehensive about Jude's moodiness that she missed her footing and the tray went over, spilling drinks and glasses everywhere. Beth and Kathy rushed over to help whilst Lucy went upstairs to get a dustpan and brush. 

"You clumsy idiot!" Jude snarled as she got up out of her chair. "That's my beer you've just spilt. Why don't you look where you're going?"

She strode off into the other half of the cellar and returned with a riding crop. She grabbed Karen from where she was tidying up and told her to bend over. Karen looked at her nervously. Reluctantly she complied, reaching for her calves as usual. As soon as she was in position Jude lashed out causing Karen to scream out loud and lose her balance, toppling forward onto her hands and knees. Scared by Jude's ferocity, Karen stayed crouched down and reached for her backside as if to protect herself but Jude grabbed her arm and pulled it away. The riding crop was just about to fall again when....

"Jude! No! Stop now!" Mel had jumped up from her chair and was now holding Jude's arm.

"What?"

"What on earth do you think you're doing? This is supposed to be fun, not assault and battery."

"Are you telling me how to discipline my sub?" Jude retorted.

"I'm saying you're too drunk to be holding a riding crop," Mel replied firmly. "Karen, are you OK?"

"Please, Jude," Karen said from the floor where she knelt, "not like that, please, not like that."

"Not like this, not like that; all I ever hear from you is about the things you won't do!" Jude wrenched her arm free from Mel's grip but&nbsp; she did let her arm drop and didn't go to use the crop again. "You're supposed to be my sub. Why don't you act like one? How about I get a little obedience for a change?"

"That's unfair." Karen got to her feet. "Just because there are some things I won't do, some things I can't do, some things... they're just not right...." She trailed off, uncertain that she wanted to have this conversation right now.

"Not right! Hark at Miss Morally Superior. No one else objects. Why should you? What makes you so bloody special? Do you think you're better than us? Do you think you're better than me?" Jude's anger was out in the open now.

"No!&nbsp; No! Of course not.&nbsp; It's just ... it's just ...." Karen trailed off.&nbsp; It would have been hard enough at the best of times to try to explain the conflicting roil of emotions around her position, and she certainly couldn't now, but she never, for one moment, thought that Jude or the others were wicked or immoral. Just because she couldn't do certain things didn't mean she looked down on those who did. Her head dropped as she realised she couldn't answer, not now, not here.

"I'll tell you why you can't answer. It's because it's not about morality, it's because you're scared," Jude sneered. "Scared of what you are, scared of what you want. You hide away behind your 'limits',"&nbsp; Jude all but spat the word, "so that you don't have to join in, not properly. You're quite happy to go to bed with me but won't accept that you're a lesbian.&nbsp; You hide it from yourself and you surely hide it from others. You won't come out to anyone, not even a little bit. Take you sister's wedding as an example, you don't even want me as your 'plus one'. You all but disowned me, right there in St George's Mall.&nbsp; I'm surprised a cock didn't crow. You lock yourself away in that closet because you're far too frightened to come out into the real world."

"The real world?" Karen looked about at the various items around the playroom. "You think this is the real world?" Karen now stood face to face with Jude. "All this stuff with Dommes and subs, it's a fantasy, that's all, a fantasy. I won't deny that it's fun, I won't deny that we don't all enjoy it. It's sexy and exciting and I want to keep on doing it but that doesn't make it real. You and me, we're real, what we have is real, or at least I thought so."

"Please, please, the two of you." Lucy stepped between them. "Please don't argue like this." There was a muttered chorus from the others in agreement but Karen and Jude had already gone too far.

"To think that I thought...." Jude started.

"Thought what?" Karen asked.

"Thought that you could be one of us."

"But I am, aren't I?" Karen glanced around at the others who muttered assent.

"No you're not, not really. You're scared to commit, you won't come out, you won't join in, you just want to sit on the sidelines dithering."

"You're the one who won't commit," Karen snapped back, now quite hurt and angry. "You're fine as long as we're playing your games but anything more than that, anything real, you just don't want to know."

"Games? Can't you see that this is part of what I am, what we all are, an important part, and now you're saying it's not real, you're saying that we all live in some sort of fantasy land?"

"Please, Jude, I'm not saying that."

"Yes you are, that's exactly what you're saying; don't try to wriggle out of it. I heard you say it, we all heard you say it. Well, I've had enough; it's make or break time.&nbsp; I'm fed up to the back teeth with you and your attitude. I'm the Domme, I make the rules, it's my way or the highway. If you want to be my sub you should be down on your knees showing a little respect and obedience, not arguing the toss all the time. There, in front of me," Jude pointed with the riding crop, "that's where you belong and it's about time you started getting past these silly limits of yours about what you'll do and who you'll do it with. You'll do what I tell you to and you'll do it with anybody I want. I'm the Domme; you're the sub. Do you understand?"

There was a long, long silence as the whole room seemed to hold its breath. 

"I can't agree to that, you know I can't agree to that and if you think my limits are silly," Karen said slowly and carefully biting back the tears, "then that means you think I'm silly too. Respect works both ways, you know."

"You're all the same, you subs, all the fucking same. Can't do this, won't do that. I've had enough; get on your knees or fuck off."

"Jude, please...." Karen wailed.

"Please what? Are you my sub or not?" Jude demanded.

"Not when you put it like that, not when you make those demands. It's not me you want," Karen said as the tears started to fall. "I thought it was but it isn't. You don't even want a real person, you just want some sort of sex slave, some robot, a Stepford wife. I can't do that, even for you. I think I'd better go."

Before anyone could do anything to stop her, she rushed upstairs to the kitchen to find her dress which was still draped over the back of a chair. She was busy putting it on when Lucy joined her.

"Are you OK?" Lucy asked.

"Yeah, I guess... Yeah, I'm fine," Karen replied. They both knew she was anything but.

"Here, you'd best have this." Lucy held out her hand and on it Karen saw the key to her collar. Somehow it felt like this was the end, the very end. Her hand shook as she took it from Lucy and she tried to unfasten the lock but she didn't seem able to fit the key in the hole.

"Here, let me," Lucy said and, taking the key from Karen's hand she unfastened the collar. "Shall I keep this?"

"No, no, please, I'd like to...." Karen didn't want to give it up. It might be all that she had left but it was hers and would forever be a special part of her.

"Of course," Lucy replied, handing it over. "Look, give us five minutes and Mel and I will share a cab with you. We're all going more or less the same way."

"You don't want to stay?" Karen asked.

"No, it's over for tonight. No one is quite in the mood anymore."

"I'm sorry," Karen said, and she meant it.

"Well, don't be. You've done nothing to be sorry about. It's Jude who should be sorry. Look, hang on and I'll get dressed."

Karen became aware of a general bustle in the hallway as the others gathered and taxis were called. She stayed in the kitchen praying that Jude would give her the space. Despite Lucy's assertions, Karen still felt as if she had let the group down, that it was her fault that everyone was so down. Then Lucy appeared at the kitchen door and told her the taxi had arrived.

As they were ferried across town Lucy tried ever so hard to be upbeat but there was no hiding what had just happened. Karen was, understandably, quiet and withdrawn. Mel just looked pissed off. Lucy's attempts to keep the conversation going faltered and they continued in an uncomfortable silence until, eventually, Karen felt she really had to say something. 

"Mel, Lucy," Karen started. "I'm really, really sorry. I feel like I've messed it all up. Just because I don't want to do certain things doesn't mean...doesn't mean...."

"Doesn't mean you think we're a pair of immoral sluts." Mel finished off for her. "Well, if ever there was an immoral slut it was this one," Mel gave Lucy a nudge and a smile, "but that's why I love her so much. Seriously, don't worry, we understand, we all understand. If anyone was out of order back there it was Jude, not you. The first rule of D/s is you never play drunk and Jude had had more than a few too many. The second rule of D/s is you always respect limits, whatever they are."

"Please, Karen," Lucy cut in, "please don't let this come between us. Just because you and Jude... just because... Whatever happens it would be awful if we stopped being friends just because you and Jude fall out."

"Friends?" Karen looked at them. "As long as you don't expect me to...."

"Friends," Lucy confirmed, "and we wouldn't expect you to do anything, well, except come round for your tea tomorrow. I'm making shepherd's pie and we'd love it if you'd join us."

"Yeah, come on over," Mel added. "You're one of us now, one of the crowd."

Karen looked at the couple and was almost overcome by the warmth of their affection. Lucy, effervescent, bubbly Lucy, was open and obvious and had always been friendly right from the start, but even gruff Mel was smiling. These were special people, people Karen had come to care a great deal about and she accepted Lucy's invitation with gratitude.

Meanwhile, on the other side of town, Beth, Kathy, Andy and Sarah were also sharing a taxi.

"You'll have to sort her out," Beth said to Andy. "It's just like Sharon all over again."

"Why is it always down to me?" Andy complained.

"Because she respects you, because she listens to you," Beth replied.

"When she's in this mood she doesn't listen to anyone. As you said, it's just like Sharon all over again. She'll sulk and she'll moan, she'll drink herself stupid and she'll hurt anyone who goes near her. Why does she have to do it, why does she have to always push them away?"

"I really thought this one was the real thing," Sarah added. "I've never seen Jude so smitten.

"That's what makes it all so awful," Beth said. "It was the real thing, it is the real thing. Karen's the best thing that's happened to Jude in ages but Jude's too pig-headed to recognise true love when it jumps up and smacks her in the face."

"I think that's the root of the problem," Sarah said ruefully. "Karen was right, Jude's scared of commitment. If only she'd open up and let her in then she'd have the perfect partner in Karen, you can see how much they love each other, but she's so scared of being hurt she puts these stupid rules in place, rules she knows full well that Karen couldn't agree to. That way she can persuade herself that it was Karen who left and not her who pushed Karen away."

For a moment or two there was silence as they all mulled this over. 

"Do you know, from a really selfish point of view I'm going to miss Karen. I know she has her limits but, despite that, she fitted in really well and wasn't there just to make up the numbers. If she and Jude really have split then I guess we're back to having Frankie join us or, god help us, any of the other waifs and strays Jude tends to go for." This was Kathy's contribution.

"I'd rather not play than have Frankie back. It's not that I don't like her but, well, she's not one of us," Andy said.

"Yeah, it wouldn't be right playing with anyone else, anyone but one of us." Sarah put in. "I mean, we all know each other, we're... we're...."

"Family?" suggested Kathy.

"Well, that would make it incest, wouldn't it, but, yeah, we're us," Sarah continued. "That's what was so good about Karen, the way she fitted in so well, the way she so quickly became one of us."

"So, what do we do?" Andy asked.

"What do we do about what?"

"What do we do when Jude wants to include Frankie, next Friday for example?"

The four women looked at each other.

"I'm going to miss Karen," Kathy repeated, "Bloody Jude and her pig-headedness."

"So why don't we stop her? Why don't we show her what she's throwing away?" Sarah said.

"Because she'll never admit she's wrong; that's Jude's problem, always has been, always will be," Andy said firmly. "As I said, it's just like Sharon all over again."

The taxi rumbled on though the night taking the four women home.

Once the taxi had dropped Karen off, she let herself into her house, went through to the kitchen and put her handbag on the table. She felt hollow, empty, and even putting the kettle on for a late night cuppa seemed like far too much trouble. She sat and stared at the wall too weary to do anything else. She couldn't help but let her mind wander over the past few months, the way her life had been turned up-side-down, how much she'd changed, how much she'd grown. It wasn't just her sexual awakening, although that had been very much part of it, it had been a voyage in self discovery, and she was now far more confident in what she stood for. Just those few months ago Karen could never have stood up to Jude in that way; it had been Jude who had given her the strength to assert herself and, ironically that had been their downfall.&nbsp; It was still hard for her to comprehend why Jude had turned on her so. Jude had always been so understanding, so protective, so caring and now, just because...

Maybe she should go back, apologise to Jude, make it up with her, go and do all the things Jude demanded but, were she to do so, then she wouldn't be her any more. If she didn't have opinions, standards, reasons, places where she drew the line in the sand, then she wouldn't be Karen, she'd be an empty shell. Surely Jude didn't want that. What also hurt was that she had made so many compromises, had made real sacrifices, but it seemed as if she did all the giving whilst Jude did all the taking. And, in the end, for all that she was far more open minded nowadays, her core hadn't changed. It couldn't, that was what it was that made her who she was. For all the aching pain inside, for all that she was going to miss Jude terribly, she really had no choice; she couldn't be the person that Jude told her she wanted, she really couldn't. There had to be a limit, a place where you said enough is enough.

With a sigh that seemed to come from the bottom of her soul, Karen took herself off to bed, knowing that sleep was not going to be easy but what else could she do?

Back at Jude's house the whiskey bottle was open and Jude, sitting at the kitchen table, was making serious inroads. For reasons she simply couldn't understand she was angrier than she had ever been before. 'Stupid little tart!' she spat and took another gulp. 'I'm better off without her. There'll always be others, others that understand, others that know the rules, others that....'

A wave of nausea rocked through her and it was all she could do to keep her whiskey down. Why did she feel so bad? It wasn't as if... yet another wave came and, with a sense of better safe than sorry, she staggered off to the bathroom taking the bottle and glass with her.

'No one unnerstands..." she slurred as she knelt down next to the toilet, carefully placing the whiskey on the floor next to her and wrapping her arms around the rim of the bowl. "Ain't no one unnerstands. They all just... they all just...." Several pints of lager and half a bottle of Bushmills roiled inside her and her insides seemed to revolt. She felt so ill, so incredibly ill, so... and during the next few minutes Jude was reminded of the very real consequences of mixing her drinks.

As the dry heaves petered out an exhausted Jude turned towards the basin and tried to reach for the tooth mug. She needed to rinse her mouth out; she badly needed to rinse her mouth out. However she couldn't reach as it was too far up the wall and, when she tried to stand up she fell back to the floor, her head barely missing the side of the toilet bowl on the way back down again.

'Oops," she muttered as she settled herself down. Maybe the tooth mug could wait.

The tiled floor was cool and comforting and surprisingly free of the swaying motion that seemed to affect the rest of Jude's world. She rested her head on the floor and closed her eyes, just for a minute, just until she got herself together, just until she felt a little better.









A few days after the split, Karen was, once again, having a toilet break when she heard the door open. A group of women from her section entered. Immediately the smell of cigarette smoke filled the restroom.

"So, did'ya catch that program on the telly last night? The one about them trannies?"

"Trannies? What, like my Rob's van?"

"No, you ha'p'orth, transsexuals. You know, men what dress up as women, like. Disgusting, that's what I call it."

"My Sharon, over at the biscuit factory, she had to work with one. He was even allowed to come to work in a dress. There was all sorts of fuss when he wanted to use the ladies." 

"I should fucking think so. What a fucking liberty. Sick, that's what I call it, sick."

"Yeah, it's bad enough having that Mel work with us."

"Mel? What's wrong with Mel?"

"She's a lezzie, isn't she? That's not natural either. It's all very well them having gay rights but what about our rights? I mean, what if she fancies me or summat?

At this point Karen's ears pricked up. An anger that had been simmering within her since the weekend raised its head.

"It's the kiddies I worry about. I mean, you don't ever know, do you? There was a story in the paper just the other day...."

As the restroom bigot recounted the sleaze from the gutter press, Karen finished off her business, pulled up her panties, yes, she did wear them nowadays, and smoothed down her skirt. Then, gathering up a courage she never knew she had, she stepped out of the booth and went over to the sinks. She rinsed off her hands and used the hand dryer before facing the group of women.

"May I remind you all that smoking in the restrooms is not only against company policy but also against the law? Furthermore as none of you seem to be in any way in need of a comfort break, I suggest that you might want to return to your desks. I will be holding a section meeting in five minutes and I think you'll find it is important that you attend." Karen controlled her anger, keeping her voice as level as possible.

"Oh, yeah, and who's going to make us?" the bigot replied.

"Well, as your section supervisor I guess that I am." Karen's blood was boiling now. "Smoking in the restrooms is a flagrant breach of office regulations. As such shall we consider this your first formal verbal warning about this misuse of office facilities? Furthermore any repeat of these offences will lead to a written warning and eventual dismissal. If you want to keep your job then I suggest you follow the rules. Or have you forgotten there's a recession on?"

"You can't do that, I'm in the union," the bigot, as ever the spokeswoman, retorted.

"The rules as I have stated them were negotiated with the full cooperation of the union," Karen replied. "In fact I believe the union were instrumental in working towards a smoke-free office even before the recent change in the law. And as for your views on gay, lesbian and transgender staff members, I think you'll find that the union has a pretty strong position on that as well. Don't forget, section meeting in five minutes."

Fired up with anger, Karen marched out of the restrooms with her head held high. It was a bit like riding a bike, getting started was the hard part. Now that she was up and running, she could use her anger to finally assert herself. The important thing was not to wobble, to use it, not to lose it. Sure, she had only left herself five minutes to bone up on the rules but, really, she had reached the limit of what she could take. She had been pushed from pillar to post and, quite frankly, if she could stand up to Jude, then there was no one here who should give her any qualms. She reached for the staff handbook and found the relevant pages.
 
"Right, ladies," Karen began once she had gathered her staff around her, "for far too long this section has been the laughing stock of the office and I, for one, have had enough. With immediate effect there are going to be one or two changes around here. For a start there has been far too much laxity regarding the rules about smoking breaks. May I remind you that, according to the rules agreed with the union," here Karen picked up the staff handbook and turned to the first marked page, "and I'm quoting from paragraph seventy three if anyone is interested, all staff taking smoking breaks must ensure that such breaks are clearly marked on their flexi-time sheets, signing out and back in again for each and every one? Starting from today, I shall be making random spot checks of all your flexi-sheets to ensure that this is being carried out. Furthermore smoking breaks must, and I repeat, must, be held in the designated smoking area which is the thing that looks a bit like&nbsp; a bus shelter over on the other side of the car park. Use of the restrooms is not permitted under any circumstances. I think you'll find," again she consulted the manual, "paragraph seventy six covers this one.

"Furthermore, may I remind you that any breaches of these rules will lead, as per the regulations," again she consulted the staff handbook, "to a formal verbal warning in the first instance, followed by a written warning, followed by dismissal. H.R. are to be informed at each stage. You are, of course, perfectly entitled to have union representation at any stage in this process but I would remind you that the union were fully involved in making these rules and were particularly active in the smoke-free office campaign. Paragraph two thirty seven is the relevant one here.

"Are there any questions?" she asked her shell-shocked staff. "No? Well that brings me to my second point. We're the joke section, the layabouts, the under achievers. Do you think management hasn't noticed? It's tough out there and, if you want to find out just how tough, then carry on the way we're going and we'll all be out of the door looking for jobs that simply don't exist. They'll have us closed down faster than you can say 'outsourced to India'. All of us, and I do mean all of us, need to buck our ideas up before it's too late.

"And, whilst I have your attention, I do have one last point," here Karen looked directly at the restroom bigot, "recently there have been a number of incidents of inappropriate language. I'm sure you're all aware of company policy, again with the complete agreement of the union, towards language that is derogatory of race, creed or sexuality. Such language will not be accepted and will dealt with under the normal disciplinary procedures. Is that quite clear?"

"You're talking about me, aren't you?" the restroom bigot asked. "Just because I can't be doing with poofs; they're dirty, they are."

"Yes, Maureen, in this instance I am talking about you, but I'm not singling you out. Exactly the same rule will apply to anyone else who uses that sort of language."

"Hah! You can't tell me what to think. It's a free country, or at least it used to be. Anyway, what would you know about anything?"

"Firstly, no, I can't tell you what to think but I can and will tell you what is, and what is not, appropriate language for the workplace and I will ensure that company policy on this matter is fully enforced. As to what I do or don't know about it, well, maybe I know a lot more than it seems you or your nasty little newspaper does." In the boiler room of Karen's anger the pressure gauges were reaching critical.

"I'm only saying what's right. I'm only saying what every one else around here thinks, Them poofs, they're sick and I don't want them anywhere near me," Maureen sneered.

And then something inside Karen just snapped. She hadn't meant to get sidetracked like this; she was just going to make a stand on the smoking thing but, here and now, she felt she had to say something, she had to be true to what she was. She couldn't be Karen the mouse anymore.

"Well, if you don't want them anywhere near you maybe it's time to find somewhere else to work because, right here, your working around me. I'm one of them, I'm a lesbian. Not only am I a lesbian but so is my girlfriend. Do you have any problem with that?" There, she'd said it.

"You..." Maureen started. The rest of the staff were stunned into silence.

"Yes, me, and I'm not ashamed of it. If you can't handle it, if it makes you feel uneasy because you have the daft idea that I might fancy you or some such nonsense then that's your problem because it certainly isn't mine. Is that quite clear? Now, does anyone else have any sort of problem with this?"

Mumbled denials were the only real response she got from her staff but there was none of the derision she would have had previously. She could tell that her words had struck home, maybe less so those about gender equality, but the general thrust had got through and the threat of their losing their jobs was very real. This once proud manufacturing town had seen a massive decline since the eighties; they would all have friends whose jobs had been outsourced so they would all know how quickly a 'job for life' could disappear. She looked around and saw Mel grinning at her and, when their eyes made contact, Mel mouthed the words 'Well done, sister'.

"Well, now we know where we all stand I suggest we all get back to work while we still have jobs. Don't forget to keep those flexi-sheets up to date. I will be checking."

Five minutes later Mel came over, ostensibly to check on how to proceed with a difficult case but, as they sat at Karen's desk she leant over and whispered "well done! I'm so proud of you. That took some bottle, facing down an old bat like Maureen."

"I... I had to. All those nasty things she was saying, I couldn't take it any more."

"Looks like there are quite a few things you can't take any more. I think the girls might even take notice for a change. Well done, sister, well done." And with that Mel returned to her desk.

The smoking break rule enforcement had an immediate effect of keeping more of the staff at their desks and the knock-on effects took only a little longer to manifest themselves. Even by the end of the week the increase in productivity was measurable and, more importantly, Karen felt that she was getting more respect, that her words were carrying more weight. She did make some checks on the flexi-time reporting sheets but, ironically, this had a positive side effect. Rather than finding unreported smoke breaks, she found a miscalculation by one of her staff who had worked more hours in than they thought and was able to take an afternoon off as a result.

But there was one more effect that she only found out about much, much later. That Friday the usual crowd met up in the club, well, most of them. Both Karen and Jude had cried off, each fearing that the other would be there. 

Hey, guys," Mel said, "you'll never guess what happened at work on Tuesday."

"Ooh, yes, you've got to see this," Lucy added. "Go on, Mel, show them."

Mel got out her mobile and, after pushing a few buttons, started showing a video clip. When Karen had started the meeting something in her eyes had told Mel that this was going to be special and that she ought to record it on her phone. She had had to be discreet, but she had captured the essence and, in particular, Karen outing herself.

The phone was passed from hand to hand, each enjoying watching their friend make her stand, each admiring the courage they all knew it must have taken for Karen to out herself like that. Mel was keen to fill in the background and explain how much the smoking rules had been abused.

"So, is our Karen now the office dragon?" Andy asked after she had watched the video. "Is she on your back all the time?"

"I wouldn't put it quite like that," Mel replied, "but she's certainly not the pushover she used to be. As for putting that cow Maureen in her place, it was all I could do not to cheer."

"She's come a long way, our Karen," Andy mused, "a long way indeed. I do hope we're not going to lose her just because Jude's being an ass."

"We had her over for a meal last Wednesday," Mel added. "She's a bit shell-shocked but she's still one of us. She asked after all of you." Mel looked up as a shadow fell across the table. "Hi Frankie, what's happening?"

"Hi, guys," Frankie addressed the table, "what's that?" she pointed to the phone, "what's so interesting?"

"A friend of ours coming out in a rather spectacular fashion." Andy, as ever took the lead when speaking for the group.

"Can I have a look?" Frankie asked and, after a quick glance at Mel who just shrugged, Beth handed the phone over to Frankie.

"That's her, isn't it?" Frankie exclaimed, "the one that was in here with Jude the other day. She kind of owes me."

"How so?" Sarah asked.

"Can I...?" Frankie indicated a chair and, having got the group's assent, sat down. Everyone could see that she did so rather gingerly and, seeing their looks, Frankie grinned.

"Yeah, the state of my arse is all part of the story," she said as she lowered herself gently down.

"It was two days ago, Wednesday, and I was in here having a quiet drink when Jude enters. I can see she's on the prowl, I know that look, and she's sniffing round some of the lippies hanging round the bar. I'm just sitting back watching the show, you know how it goes. Anyway, she gets no joy there and she's still on her own when a bunch of tourists wander in. How? I don't know, someone must have given them the address or summat and, anyway, Wanda's not too fussy midweek, not if it's slow.&nbsp; As soon as Jude spots them she's on them like a shot, giving it life and soul of the party, but I guess she comes on too strong and half scares the poor little things away. Wanda even had to step in and have a word with her.

"By ten thirty Jude's getting desperate so she wanders over in my direction. I mean, how insulting is that, she can't get anyone else so it's over to good old Frankie.&nbsp; I nearly tell her to fuck off but, well, I'm in the mood, she's always fun to play with and, after all, I had nothing else going for me that evening. Anyway, to cut a long story short we grab a cab and off we go to her place.

"And that's where it all goes pear shaped. You know me, girls, I like a bit of rough and I'm the world&#8217;s biggest pain slut, but we've hardly got there before she has me arse over tit and she's ramming the world&#8217;s biggest strap-on up my jacksie. I'm screaming at her to slow down but all I get is some sort of lecture about how subs have to take whatever's coming to them. I mean, what's that all about? What's more the way she's going about it she's likely to do me a mischief.

"Any road, I've had enough. It's not just that she's hurting me, I can take that even if I still can't sit down properly for a couple of days afterwards. It's not even that I'm scared I'll end up in hospital, although that's part of it. Nah, it's as if she don't care or sommat, it's not Frankie she's fucking the arse off of, I'm just some piece of meat to her and that ain't right, whichever way you put it. So I yell out the safe word and, to give her her due, that pulls her up short. She pulls out, rolls me over and, this is the really scary bit, she goes all gooey on me; it's like she can't apologise enough. Talk about chalk and cheese, one moment she's pounding the living daylights out of my arse and the next she's Mother Theresa or summat. And all the time she's babbling some nonsense about how confused she is, how it's not been the same since Karen.

"Now I'm not that clever, hey, I'm not being modest, I know what I am but what I'm not is stupid. You don't have to be fucking Einstein to twig that it wasn't me she was trying to hurt it was this Karen. It might be my bum hole that's been ripped asunder but it was Karen that Jude wanted to fuck over. I tried to be all nicey nicey, a friend in need and all that, but you know what Jude's like. As soon as she realised I wasn't really hurt she clammed up tight. I mean she was polite and all but the next thing I know I'm dressed, in a cab and on my way home.

"So, yeah, next time you see that Karen tell her she owes me, I took the fucking from hell on her account and two days later I still can't sit down without wincing. I wouldn't mind so much but I didn't even get a decent orgasm out of it. Hey, gotta go, girls, that's Julie over there and she and I have got a thing going. Early days yet but you can never tell. Your Frankie might not be a free agent much longer. See ya!"

And with that she was off to join Julie, leaving, as so often happened, a stunned and bewildered crowd behind her.

"We can't leave it like this. I'm going to see her," Lucy said with determination.

"She won't thank you," Andy commented. "You know what she's like."

"We all know what she's like." Lucy was getting quite worked up. "She's hurting and she'll do what she always does, shove it down the neck of a bottle. Next thing you know she'll be in trouble at work again and bang goes her promotion prospects for another two years. We're her friends; we need to help her, that's what friends do."

"Yeah, but if you go round there then she'll just bawl you out. You'll just have made things worse. Best leave it to sort itself out," Sarah contributed.

"What, like it did with Sharon? We all thought that one would 'sort itself out', that Jude and Sharon would get back together again but what happened? Jude just wallowed in self-pity making herself and all around her totally miserable. I'm not going to let that happen again." Lucy was adamant.

"So what do you suggest? Do you want us all to storm round there and tell her to buck her ideas up? I can't see that working, in fact it will just make things worse, just make her more stubborn," Sarah replied. "Look, Lucy, I've known Jude the longest. She and I, well, we go way back, and, when she gets like this the only thing to do is sit back and wait. If we try to interfere it would just make things worse. Trust me on this one."

And with that the matter was, for the time being, laid to rest. What wasn't laid to rest was the video on Mel's phone. Frankie was telling all and sundry and quite a few were interested enough to come on over and ask for a look. By the end of the evening the batteries in Mel's phone were completely exhausted and, completely unbeknown to her, Karen had become a bit of a celebrity. 

Come eleven o'clock when, had it been a normal Friday, they would have been heading for Jude's house, there was an unspoken agreement to give it a rest for a week or so; that, somehow, the fun had gone out of things.

"Do you know?" Lucy said as she snuggled up to Mel in the back of the cab on the way home, "I'm glad it's just the two of us tonight."

"How so?" Mel enquired.

"Well, it'll be nice, just you and me for a change."

"Are you going all Karen on me?" Mel asked.

"No, of course not, well, not entirely but it does make you think, doesn't it?"

"What does?"

"Well, there are things I prefer to keep special, things just for you and me."

"Of course there are, that goes without saying," Mel agreed, "and, as soon as we get home, we'll be doing them."

"Ooh, yes please, Mistress." Lucy chuckled and they snuggled a little closer together.

On the other side of town Jude was moping around her house bored to tears. It had been ages since she had spent a Friday in; either she was out on the beat or she was down at the club and this nothing, this emptiness was getting her down. She'd flicked through the TV channels but, apart from a couple of inane panel shows, the only other thing of interest was a police thriller. After half an hour of shouting 'we don't do it like that' at the screen she finally switched it off. She reached for the whiskey bottle which, somehow, seemed to be emptier than she expected, and poured herself a couple of fingers. She flicked through a magazine and tried reading a book but nothing seemed to work. Nothing could hold her attention.

When eleven o'clock had rolled round she had half expected the others to turn up; this was, after all, a Friday night and, Karen or no, it was playtime. By midnight, and still no sign of them, she realised that she had been let down and was going to be on her own again. She even thought about giving them a call but she couldn't trust that little minx Lucy not to spring some trap and try and push her back with Karen, just like she had done last time.

She felt a bitter resentment every time she thought about Karen. She had no right to have been down at the club in the first place, a silly little wannabe like her. And then, that first evening, how she had blown hot and cold; that ought to have been a clue. But, for all her bitterness, the image that came to mind was of Karen lifting the hem of her dress to show off her legs. There was this fragility and strength combined that, right from the start, Jude had found so attractive. And with that came a cascade of other images, the way Karen would bite her bottom lip whenever she was pushed outside her comfort zone, the warm smile that lit up her face whenever she had broken through another taboo, that look she got in her eyes as they cuddled up in bed together, the way she would make breakfast wearing nothing but an apron to protect her from the spitting fat, the way she cared. At this point Jude took another long swig from her whiskey glass.

This need, this emptiness was almost physical, located deep in her belly but, as she ruminated, she saw another image, that of Karen standing firm, the Karen that had made her stand and she knew in her heart that any attempt to patch things up would run up against the same problem. At the end of the day they were too different. If Karen couldn't accept her for what she was, accept that a Domme is always a Domme, then there was no point, no point at all.

After all, before Karen had come along she'd been doing fine on her own, she'd had plenty of fun, plenty of playmates, girls who knew how the game was played, girls who knew their place. And that brought back to mind the disastrous night she'd had with Frankie. What a nightmare that had been. Hard as she tried she couldn't really blame Frankie and, when it had all gone wrong, she'd made a fool of herself by blubbing. Knowing Frankie, that little story would be half way round the club by now, with everyone laughing at the big Domme's downfall.

She went to pour herself another whiskey but found that the bottle was empty so, lurching slightly, she took herself off to bed.

Jude wasn't the only one who was hurting. Karen too had spent a boring evening on her own. Lucy and Mel had asked if she wanted to go to the club but the possibility of running into Jude was more than she could bear. She'd watched some stupid cop drama; it hadn't been too bad but seeing women police officers, even if they were just actors, reminded her too much of Jude and how good she looked in uniform. 

Whilst she cursed Jude for her pigheadedness she had to admit that the last few months had opened her eyes more than a little. She had had to rethink many of her basic tenets, her fundamental views on what was and was not 'right' or 'moral'. As she had learnt to accept her new-found friends&#8217; proclivity for a sexuality that was well outside the norm, so too she had learnt to accept that she shared many of these desires and, given the right circumstances, would willingly join in. Why then had Jude had to go and ruin it all by demanding more than she could give, indeed, more than any reasonable person would want to give? Why did Jude fail to understand that, for her, sex without love was joyless and hollow? She'd gladly and unreservedly give her body but only to her lover.

But, for all these ponderings right here, right now, she desperately wanted a cuddle and there was only one person she wanted that cuddle from. Damn her, damn Jude and her pigheadedness.

Come Wednesday night Jude was, once again, propping up the bar down at the club when she overheard two other patrons talking.

"Did you see that video clip?" the first asked. "The one of Mel and Lucy's friend?"

At this Jude's ears pricked up.

"The one that Frankie was on about? Yeah, I loved it. I told Mel she should post it on YouTube but she said it was too private."

"Excuse me," Jude butted in, "this video, who's on it?"

"That wassername, Karen, isn't it? Yeah, Karen, the one that... hang on, didn't you spend some time with her?"

"Karen, yes, I did. And this video...?"

"You gotta see it, it's classic. Ask Mel next time you see her."

"I will, I definitely will," Jude affirmed.

Two minutes later Jude had found a quiet corner and was on the phone to Mel.

"Hi Mel, it's me, Jude," she said once she was connected. "Look, are you doing anything this evening?"

"No, Lucy's out with friends and I'm just doing the chores. Come on over."

And so it was that, half an hour later Jude arrived at Mel and Lucy's house. Mel led her through to the lounge where the TV was on and the ironing board was set up. A pile of clothes lay in a basket and a slightly smaller pile was neatly folded ready to be put away.

"What the fuck!" exclaimed Jude. "Are you doing the ironing?"

"Yeah, I hope you don't mind if I carry on." 

"But you're a Domme. What sort of Domme does the ironing?" Jude said.

"One who needs clean clothes in the morning. Anyway, Lucy's out tonight and I've got nothing better to do," Mel explained.

"But that's not the point." Jude was adamant. "That's a sub's job; a Domme shouldn't lower herself to do menial tasks."

"What? You're suggesting that I should sit around all day whilst Lucy does all the work? Lucy's my wife, not my skivvy. Sure, it's all Mistress and slave in the bedroom, or the playroom, or the club but, back in the real world, she's my partner and I love her too much to mistreat her. We share things, together, and that includes the ironing."

For a moment Mel and Jude just stared at each other.

"Well, would you like a cuppa or is too menial a task for me to go and make you one?" Mel said at last.

"No, er, yes, I mean, thank you, I'd love a coffee if you would."

Mel and Jude went through to the kitchen where Mel filled the kettle and switched it on.

"So, what brings you to this neck of the woods?" Mel asked, "apart, of course, from a need to criticise my lifestyle."

"Just keeping in touch," Jude lied. "I mean, seeing as how Friday night's seem to have gone by the board for a while. Bloody woman, why did she have to go and ruin everything?"

"I&nbsp; assume by 'bloody woman', you're referring to Karen. If so I'm not sure I agree that she's the one who ruined everything."

"What, you think that it's my fault?"

"Who said anything about fault?" Mel said gently. "Please, Jude, I don't want to argue with you but, well, there are two sides to every story, OK?"

"I'm just saying that if Karen wanted to be my sub then she had a funny way of going about it, making up all sort of stupid rules and limits. Her job was to shut up and do as she was told, not argue the toss all the time."

"And get on with the ironing...." Mel suggested.

"Yes," Jude replied before she realised what Mel was saying. "Well, if I had a sub I certainly wouldn't be doing it."

"Maybe that's why you haven't got a sub," Mel suggested as she turned back to the kettle, which had now boiled.

Jude was completely taken aback. She'd expected that Mel, and indeed all the crowd, would be taking her side and yet, here was Mel effectively telling her that she was wrong. 

"I heard down the club," Jude tried to be as casual as possible, "that you've got some sort of video clip, something to do with Karen." 

"So that's what brings you over," Mel laughed, "I knew it wasn't my sparkling personality. Yeah, I've got a clip of Karen; would you like to see it?"

Mel found her phone, pressed the relevant buttons and passed it over to Jude. The picture was shaky, the words were hard to make out and, as often as not, Karen was obscured but, nevertheless, there she was, making her stand. And then she got to the bit where Karen said 'Not only am I a lesbian but so is my girlfriend' and Jude had to stop, rewind and watch it again. Girlfriend?

"She says 'girlfriend' on this. Has she found someone else?" Jude asked, her whole world crumbling around her.

"Someone new? Karen? Are you really that dumb?" Mel said quite angrily. "That girl's going through hell because of your pigheadedness and you wonder if she's got someone new. I, and everyone else, assumes she means you, not that you deserve it for one moment."

"But...." Jude was taken aback by the vehemence of Mel's anger, "But it would never have worked between the two of us. We're too different, we're chalk and cheese."

"And that's just an excuse you tell yourself to try to stop it from hurting. Every time anyone gets close to you, you end up pushing them away. Why? What's wrong with you? What are you so scared of? Do you want to end up another sad old lonely butch wondering why the pretty girls don't fancy you any more? Get real girl, get real."

The two women sat in silence over the kitchen table supping their coffee. Jude, for want of anything else to do, picked up Mel's phone and, once again, played the clip. Her thoughts were a confused tumble of conflicting emotions; Bloody Karen, how could she do this to her, how could she....

"I'd best be off," Jude said, getting up from the table. "I've got things to do."

"What, whiskey to drink, you mean," Mel said.

"Please, Mel...."

"OK, that was harsh but that's what you're going to do, isn't it? Go home and hit the bottle. I know you, Jude, I've known you for a long time and I'm more than a trifle fond of you but you're your own worst enemy. Please, I hate to see a good friend fuck up her life like the way you seem determined to."

"I thought you'd understand; I thought you'd sympathise." Jude said bitterly.

"Perhaps I do," Mel replied, "perhaps I understand better than you think. Please, Jude, for the sake our friendship, think about it, think about what you're doing."

Jude looked at her friend. If nothing else their shared experiences counted for something but, right now, Jude was in no position to take it all in. She shook her head, stood up and put on her coat.

"I'll think about it," she said. "Will I see you Friday?"

"Err.. we've... look... well...," Mel realised there was no way out of this one. "Jude, thing is we're giving it a rest for a few weeks."

"What, you and Lucy?"

"No, all of us. It doesn't feel right at the moment. Not without Karen." There, she'd said it.

"But there's always Frankie, or one of the other girls."

"But that's the point. We don't want to play with Frankie or one of the other girls. They're not family."

"And Karen is, I suppose. Well, at least I know who my friends are, or aren't. Fuck you and all who sail in you." And with that Jude stormed off into the night.












Jude couldn't believe Mel had been so unsympathetic. In many ways she saw Mel and Lucy as the perfect D/s couple. They had clearly defined roles: Mel the tough butch and Lucy the pretty femme. And yet, there was Mel doing the ironing. What on earth was that all about? Surely Mel could see that doing the ironing was degrading for a Domme, that it reduced her stature. How could a sub be respectful to a Domme who did the ironing?

But it was the things that Mel had said that had really got to her. She had been completely unsympathetic and had said that, somehow, she had 'pushed Karen away'. And then there was this nonsense about Friday nights, how they were on hold for a few weeks, how they wouldn't feel right without Karen. Although Mel had ducked the question, it was quite clear where she was pointing the finger of blame. What sort of friends were these, to turn on her like this? She had been so sure they were going to understand how she felt; and yet they had gone and taken Karen's side. Where was their loyalty? 

She got into her car feeling hurt and confused. She'd already had a couple of drinks at the club, and probably shouldn't be driving; but, well, just as far as the next pub wouldn't hurt, would it? Weaving slightly as she pulled out, she drove the couple of hundred yards or so to the corner, into the car park of the Rose And Crown, where she parked up and went inside.

She went up to the bar and ordered a whiskey, no, make that a double, and, moments later, Bushmill's finest slid down her throat, warming her inside. She perched on a barstool and, hunched over her glass, took another sip and let the whiskey do its stuff. 

"Do you want another?" the barman asked. Jude looked up and realised her glass was empty. She nodded and the barman poured her a refill. Another followed that one and Jude was just starting on yet another, when the door of the pub opened.

"Come along, Judy, you know you're barred," the barman called out.

"Be a love, just the one. Look, I've got the money." 

The back of the bar was mirrored and, when Jude looked up, there, in the reflection, she saw a bag lady shuffling across the pub, holding out a handful of loose change in front of her. However, the barman had come round from behind the bar and had started to kindly but firmly guide her back towards the door. Jude stared at the woman and then at the glass in front of her and her whole world seemed to shift. Sure, this wasn't the first bag lady she'd seen; pulling the drunks out of the gutter was part and parcel of her job, albeit one she didn't particularly relish. But why in Hell did this one have to be called Judy? There was even a faint physical resemblance. But she wasn't a drunk, was she? Jude thought back over the previous week and realised she'd been tipsy, and that was putting it mildly, every day since she and Karen had split. She felt as if she were standing on the brink of an abyss, teetering on the edge. That forlorn figure being guided out of the door was her future unless she did something about it now. She put down her unfinished drink and walked out into the night. There, standing in the car park was Judy, the bag lady.

"Judy, Judy, wait up!" she called out after the shuffling figure. Judy just turned and stared.

"There's a shelter, just down in Crown Street," Jude continued. "You can get a cup of tea there."

"Don't want tea. I just need a little drink and that bastard...." Judy muttered.

"Please, let me help you," Jude said firmly.

"Don't want help, don't need help, just want a little drink, that's all," Judy said in reply.

"Now come along...." Jude started.

"Go &#8217;way," Judy snarled, "I don't need you, I don't need anyone, I just need a drink."

At this point, had she been on duty, Jude would have had a number of options. Now, off duty and more than a little worse for wear, she could do nothing. She just stood and watched as the bag lady shuffled off. The stubborn pigheaded fool, Jude thought to herself before, once again, realising that the description fitted them both.

"I don't need anyone, I just need a drink." That's what Judy had said and the words resonated deep within Jude. She felt as if the very ground beneath her feet had been whipped away and she was lost, floating, falling; she needed to go somewhere, anywhere, anywhere but here, although for the life of her she didn't know why. She thought of going home but her house would be empty and lonely. She thought of calling up one of her friends but, after her roasting from Mel, she wasn't sure what reception she would get; anyway, ten thirty at night is a little late to go calling. She went over to her car, got in and tried to start it, but she was so uncoordinated she couldn't get the key in the lock. The realisation hit her that she was too far over the limit&nbsp; even to consider driving. She got out again, and, reeling slightly, locked the car after three tries, and walked away.

More out of something to do than any real hunger, she walked towards a kebab stand that she knew could be found just around the corner. She'd eaten there often when on duty and their kebabs were not too inedible. She ordered a doner with everything and took it outside and started walking. Anything just to keep moving.

Ten minutes later Jude threw the soggy remains of the paper bag that had once held the doner into a waste bin. Now that she was walking it seemed like she just had to carry on; it wasn't that she was going anywhere, it was simply the thing to do as her mind churned over the night's events. So far the fortress of her pigheaded self-confidence was holding fast, but it was under siege from two fronts. Firstly there was the way the group, her so called friends, had apparently ostracised her, had taken Karen's side and effectively banned her from Friday nights. Suddenly she was the outsider, the one who didn't fit, and that brought back all sorts of memories of school days, of crushed emotions, hidden feelings and an overarching loneliness. 

But if the past was painful so too was the glimpse of the abyss into which she was falling. Just because she could still afford Bushmills, and had yet to descend to Special Brew out of a can shakily gripped in a paper bag, didn't detract from the fact that her first reaction to Mel's harshness had been to head for the pub and that wasn't the first time she had done so. She couldn't deny it, she had been drunk every day since... every day since... every day.

Damn it, damn it, damn it! Why had she been so weak and let this happen to her? Karen was just supposed to be a bit of fun. She was just supposed to be a game, a silly little straight girl whose world she would rock, and then and then... but if anybody's world had been rocked it wasn't Karen's, it was Jude's.&nbsp; But what was it that Karen wanted from her? If she didn't want Jude the Domme then what other Jude was there?

Jude's meanderings had led her down to the river, and she turned right towards the promenade.&nbsp; On one side the closed arcades looked empty and forlorn; on the other the low tide had exposed acres of exposed mudflats dotted with the occasional pleasure boat. The streetlight's yellow glow reflected on the oily surface, giving it an extra air of desolation. She leaned against a railing and stared out across the estuary, not staring at anything in particular, just staring. A sudden squall brought with it a shower of rain and Jude turned up her collar; all those nights on the beat meant that she wasn't bothered by a drop of rain. But this rain had set in for good and, as the shower turned to a downpour, she just stood, leant against the railing, staring out to sea.

"Excuse me, are you OK?"

Jude turned to see who was calling her. A police panda car had pulled up at the curb and a copper had got out and was coming towards her.

"Oh, it's you. Hello, Jude. A bit damp to be out at this time of night."

"Hi, George," Jude replied. "I just needed some fresh air."

George gave her a long hard look.

"Are you sure you're OK? You don't look it. I could give you a lift home if you want. Sarge won't need to know."

"No, that's OK. Thanks, George, really, I'm fine."

The look on George's face told how much he disbelieved her but, after a moment or two he said goodnight and went back to the car. Jude, her reverie broken, started walking again. With her head down against the rain she trudged through the night; it was as if somehow, when she was moving, the ache within her was easier. The only thing was not to stop, to just keep going, and going, and going.

Worn out at last, she leaned against a tree. Here it was slightly dryer and she could rest for a while. She looked up to see where she was and realised with a start that she was outside Karen's house. Whether it was chance or her subconscious that had brought her this way was a question she didn't want to answer. The neat suburban street with its row of identical houses, each with its manicured garden, spoke everything about Karen from the outside, the little Englander, the petit-bourgeois values. Here and there along the street a window glowed, often with the flickering light from a TV set, but Karen's house was dark. Surely she must be in bed, asleep. Jude could just picture her, snug and warm in her flannelette nighty; so prim, so proper, so...

so warm, so desirable, so loving, so simply perfect. 

Jude's hunger for Karen was physical; she quite literally ached with need. But it was something other than sex that she craved; she wanted to be held, comforted, mothered. Sure it had started as sex but there was this other Karen, this real Karen, who kept coming through. Just beyond Karen the sexy sub there was another Karen she also needed, the Karen who stood up for herself, the Karen who was strong, who knew her mind, who took no nonsense, the Karen who....

"Jude, is that you? What on earth are you doing?"

Jude turned. She had been so lost in thought that she hadn't heard the approaching footsteps and, there on the pavement, standing under an umbrella, was Karen, walking home from the bus stop after an evening out.

Jude felt like a fool. What was she doing there, how could she explain it?

"I was just out for a walk," she said lamely.

Karen just stood and looked at her.

"Out for a walk. Pull the other one, it's got bells on. Excuse me, but it's pouring with rain, you're right over on the other side of town from your house, it's," Karen glanced at her watch, "the thick end of midnight and you're just 'out for a walk'. Please, Jude, give me some credit. What are you doing, stalking me? I'm not a complete fool, you know."

"No, you're not a fool, I never thought you were. Nor am I stalking you, I just... I just....&nbsp; Look, I'm sorry, I'm really not stalking you but, you&#8217;re right, I shouldn't be here, I'll go." Jude, physically and emotionally exhausted, simply couldn't find a way to explain. There was so much to say and she hadn't the words to say it with. Better to leave, better to walk away. She pushed herself up away from the tree where she had been leaning and turned to go.

"Jude, it's tipping it down, this is no weather to be out walking the streets. Can't I at least offer you a cup of coffee?" Karen asked to Jude's retreating back but Jude was already leaving. "Jude, stop, please!" Karen called out and, this time, Jude turned back.

"Jude, please," Karen continued, "Stop being a bloody fool. I don't know what's got into you but I can't let you just walk away like this. Please, come inside, have a cup of coffee and let me call you a taxi."

Jude looked at Karen and, for a while, her stubbornness fought with common sense. She was cold, she was wet through and Karen was right, she was just being a bloody fool but, somehow, saying yes would be too much like capitulation. For a long while she just stood there dithering as the last vestiges of her pride held out but, in the end, common sense won. She turned back and meekly let Karen lead her across the road and into her house.

"There's a spare towel in the bathroom," Karen said as they stood in the hallway. "Go upstairs and dry yourself off. If you bring your clothes downstairs I'll put them in the tumble for you and they&#8217;ll all be dry in no time. You can use my dressing gown in the meanwhile."

"I thought this was just coffee," Jude protested.

"Jude, stop being such a damn fool," Karen said with exasperation. "Just because we're not sleeping together any more doesn't mean that... Oh, for Pete's sake just do it, will you. Come on, bathroom, top of the stairs, second door on the right. You know the way."

Karen's school ma'am tone got through to Jude and, reluctantly, she did as she was told. She peeled off her sodden clothes and dropped them in the bath. The towel had been hanging over the radiator and was lovely and warm and, for the first time in ages, Jude was feeling some comfort. However, once she had finished, she realised that Karen's dressing gown wasn't hanging on the back of the bathroom door. It must be on the equivalent hook on the back of the door to Karen's bedroom. Wrapping the towel around herself, she crossed the landing to find it. It was exactly where she had thought and, now that she was in Karen's bedroom, she felt an overwhelming wave of nostalgia; they&#8217;d had so many good times right here. She remembered their first time, Karen's mixture of na&#239;vet&#233; and joy, of shyness and gay abandon; why had she thrown all this away? She looked around the room, wallowing in the memories. To top it all, there on her dressing table was a jewellery stand and, in pride of place, the necklace complete with its dog tag. Jude went to have a closer look and saw that, as well as the necklace, tucked in the clips holding the dressing table mirror, there was a photo of them both in happier times.

The contrast could not have been more clear; whereas Jude had been running away from all their shared memories, Karen was embracing them, treasuring them.

With a sense of shock Jude realised the extent and intensity of Karen's feelings and, therefore, just how much it must have hurt her to walk away. Jude had been so wrapped up in her own self-pity that she hadn't considered whether Karen would be hurting too. Here, dramatically, was all the evidence she needed. Just because Karen had acted with more dignity didn't mean she didn't feel the pain. Jude felt humbled, a petulant child beside this grown-up. However, it was time to go downstairs and face up to what she had done.

"I've made you coffee, is that OK?" Karen asked, as she took the sodden clothes from Jude.

"Perfect. Er... Karen," Jude started.

"Just a minute," Karen called out from the utility room. Jude heard the tumble dryer start up and Karen returned. She sat down at the kitchen table and motioned Jude to take the other chair.

"That's better. Your clothes will be dry in no time. Now, are you OK?"

"I don't deserve this," Jude said.

"What, I should have left you out in the rain? Just because we're not... just because we've stopped.... Dammit, Jude, whatever has happened between us I still care about you! I can't stop that."

"That's what I don't deserve," Jude said simply. "I don't deserve you. I'm a bitch who only thinks of herself and I don't deserve someone as wonderful as you."

"Is that what you came all this way to say to me?" Karen asked gently. She reached out and took Jude's hand in hers. "Anyway, I'm not sure that what you deserve has anything to do with it."

There was another awkward pause as neither one dared say what she really wanted to. Jude looked down at Karen's hand. Such a simple gesture but with so many meanings.

"I saw Mel's video, the one of you coming out," Jude said finally as a way of breaking the silence.

"That damn thing, I wish she'd just delete it."

"I'm glad she didn't. I'd never have known otherwise. I never thought you had the bottle, although I ought to have known. You were just fine and, well... I was proud of you." There was another pause. Jude stared at their conjoined hands. She felt overwhelmed by the power of the emotions she was feeling but didn't know how to put it into words. Sorry, that seemed like a good place to start.

"Karen," Jude lifted her head and looked Karen in the eye, "I'm sorry, I'm so, so, sorry. I never should have hurt you, I was a pigheaded fool and couldn't see right from wrong. Look, you said you had a girlfriend, in the video, I mean. Did you mean me?"

"Well, there's no one else, if that's what you mean."

"No, I don't mean that. It's just that I wasn't sure that I was your girlfriend any more. I mean I'd like to be but... well... I know I don't deserve it but, please, do you think we could try again?"

"With you making all the rules and me agreeing to anything you say?" Karen knew she was being hard, but she had to know.

"No, no, not like that. I love you, I love you with all my heart and all my soul and I will never, ever, ask more of you than you're prepared to give. I was a self-centred idiot who didn't know what she had until she lost it." 

Karen, her heart singing with joy, was too overwhelmed to respond and Jude, taking Karen's silence as uncertainty, slipped off her chair and fell on her knees before her.

"Karen, I need you, I'll do anything for you...."

"Oh, Jude, did you really think you would have to beg? I never stopped loving you, not for one moment." Karen looked down at Jude on the floor in front of her. Seeing proud Jude on her knees felt wrong, so wrong. "Please, Jude, you don't belong down there. Get off your knees and kiss me."

Jude stood up and there was a moment's awkwardness as now she was standing over Karen and she didn't want that either, so she pulled Karen to her feet and, standing together in Karen's kitchen, they kissed and kissed and kissed.&nbsp; Jude knew that, whatever happened now, her life would never be the same. She had changed, changed for the better, and Karen had been the one who brought that about. But it wasn't just about her, Karen too had changed and, as they snuggled together she could feel Karen pulling at her dressing gown so as to get closer, so as to have one less layer between them. Their emotional need had a very physical expression.

"I need you in bed, now!" Jude demanded huskily.

"I thought you'd never ask," Karen replied and, still touching each other as much as possible, they made their way upstairs.

Six-thirty the next morning found Karen bringing a breakfast tray to Jude who was still sleeping. 

"Come on, sleepy head, I've got work to go to. What shift are you on?"

"Eight 'till four. God, my head is thumping. Is that the time, I need to get a move on. Where are my clothes?"

"Still in the tumble. Shall I go and fetch them for you."

"Please, I've got to rush. And my wallet, my mobile...."

"All downstairs on the kitchen table. You eat your breakfast and I'll go and sort out your clothes."

Karen was busy running an iron over Jude's stuff when, wearing Karen's spare dressing gown, Jude appeared at the kitchen door, holding her tea in one hand and a slice of toast in the other.

"Ironing? I've no time for that, Please, Karen, I'll have to wear them creased. I've got to pick up my car and then go home and change. Do us a favour, will you, call me a cab?"

Karen kept an eye out for the taxi whilst Jude pulled on her clothes. She was barely dressed when she heard Karen call 'it's here' so, grabbing her wallet and phone, she made her way towards the front door.

"Look, I've got to dash... Karen... really... look... must talk soon... really important... but we've no time now... I love you...." Anxious or not Jude took the time to kiss Karen, a kiss that threatened to go on and on.

"I love you too, now go!" ordered Karen. "Come on, your taxi&#8217;s waiting."

Together they went to the front door but just before she left Jude turned once again to Karen. 

"Karen... honey... look... don't tell Mel... about us, I mean... will you? "

"Why not?" Karen started but Jude was already halfway to the garden gate and there was no time for explanations.

Come mid-morning, Karen was busy compiling the weekly figures when her phone bleeped, announcing that she had received a text. Surreptitiously she reached down and took her phone out of her handbag. It wasn't like her to break the rules, but this wasn't any ordinary day.

Phone you noon
I love you
Jude

Karen's heart gave another little leap. It was so unlike Jude to use 'I love you' in a text.

"I do hope someone isn't using her phone at work," Mel's voice made Karen jump.

"Just a text...."

"Hey, you don't have to explain yourself to me. I'm not the boss around here," Mel joked. "Would that text be something to do with whatever's making you so happy today?"

"Happy?"

"Yeah, happy, beaming smile, big grin all over your face. What's up?"

"I... I... I promised not to tell," Karen said sheepishly.

"Really? What was it you promised not to tell? OK, OK, I'm only joking. I'll keep quiet; I won't tell Lucy that you're back with Jude."

"How did you know?"

"So you are back with Jude. How did I guess? It's written all over your face. Something to do with the way you can't stop smiling. Do you know how hard it's going to be for me not to tell Lucy?"

"Please don't. I promised."

"You may have promised but I didn't." Mel saw Karen's face drop. "Don't worry; I'm only teasing, I'll keep quiet. Your secret is safe with me." And with that Mel went back to her desk.

On the dot of midday Karen was out of the office and on her way to the park. She was less than half way there when her phone burst into life with Jude's name displayed on the screen.

"Hi, Karen, look, it's Jude. I can't chat for long, one of those days, but can I pick you up after work this evening?"

"Yes, please!" Karen couldn't keep the delight out of her voice, nor did she want to.

"You get out at five, don't you?" Jude asked.

"That's right."

"I'll see you then. Oh, and have I told you lately that I love you?"

"You stole that line from Van Morrison."

"And what if I did? Doesn't mean I don't mean it. Love you, gotta go."

And with that the phone went dead.

The afternoon passed in a blur for Karen. All she could think about was five o'clock and all that that would bring. She was the first out of the office and, when she emerged, she found Jude waiting for her outside. She went straight over and kissed her right on the lips.

"Wow! Someone's getting bold," Jude joked.

"I'm just so happy I want the world to see," Karen replied and they hugged again.

"Look, there's something I want to say, something important; let's go to Franco's, you know, the Italian in Water Lane, we can stop there for our tea and discuss it over the meal."

Jude led Karen to where her car was parked and, twenty minutes later, Karen and Jude were settled at their table, having ordered from the early-bird menu.

"OK, I've waited long enough, what's so important, what do you want to talk about?" Karen asked.

Jude looked suddenly serious.

"When I woke up with you this morning I realised I want to wake up with you every morning. I've been thinking about this all day. It's stupid us living apart, stupid us having two houses. Please, darling, I want share all my life with you, every moment of it, not just the weekends. Please, what do you say? Will you move in with me?"

"I'm not sure..." Karen started. Jude looked devastated. Teasingly Karen waited a moment longer before continuing, "I'm not sure if I should move in tonight or whether we should wait for the weekend."

"You tease!" 

"Better get used to it. Seriously, it's still quite early and if we swing by my place I could pack a few things and then, maybe, we could move the rest of my stuff this weekend, if you're not on the beat, that is."

"No, for once I've got the weekend off. Are you sure?"

"Am I sure I want to move in? Unlike some people around here I've been sure for months. If you knew how much I've wanted to move in with you and all the while you wouldn't even grant me a little space in your closet but, hey, that's all in the past. Oh, Jude, I'm so happy you've asked at last. You've no idea how happy that makes me." For a long, long while they just stared at each other until they were disturbed by the arrival of a waiter. "Ooh, that looks good. Yes, please, I'm the insolata caprese."

So it was that Karen and Jude spent the early part of the evening at Karen's house packing for the move. Karen was amazed at how much junk she had accumulated over the years, and the pile to go to Oxfam was almost as big as the pile to go to Jude's. Even so, by the time they finished, both the boot and back seat of Jude's car were packed with suitcases and boxes and, even in the front, there was barely room for Karen. When they arrived at Jude's house, it took several trips to unload the car and the hallway ended up littered with items that had yet to find somewhere to live.

"If I'd known you had so much stuff I wouldn't have asked you to move in," Jude joked as they unpacked Karen's clothes in the bedroom. "I'm not sure if we need a new wardrobe or a skip."

"There is quite a bit and you're right, we are going to have to get another wardrobe. Our clothes will get all creased crushed in together like this," Karen commented as she tried to squeeze in yet another dress.

"I guess so. How do you fancy a trip to IKEA on Saturday?"

"That makes sense; I won't put anything else away until then." Karen looked ruefully at the overladen shelves. "Not that I'd be able to if I wanted to." 

It was quite late by the time they had finished, well, finished for the day. Exhausted but happy they snuggled up in bed together.

"So, lover, why is this a big secret? Why can't I tell Mel?" Karen asked after she had kissed Jude on the tip of her nose. "And it's not just her; what about all the others? You know I'm dying to tell everyone."

"You're not the only one who wants to tell everyone but I want to make it special and that's why I want to keep it secret for just a little longer. Please, if you tell Mel then she'll tell Lucy and, after that, you might as well announce it on the nine o'clock news. Tomorrow it's Friday and everyone will be down at the club. We'll go down a bit later than normal, wait until everyone is there, and then, together, we'll make a formal announcement. How does that sound?"

"That sounds perfect but, if we're going down the club, what about afterwards? Will we be inviting them all back here?"

"Well, I'd like to but... Look..." This was the first time they had talked about the Friday evening sessions and Jude was really nervous; she didn't want to open up old wounds and upset Karen. "It's up to you; I don't want anyone coming back here if you don't."

"But I do, really I do," Karen assured Jude. "Seriously, honey, I don't want Friday nights to stop, it's part of who you are; it's part of who we are." And Karen meant it. Apart from anything else there was a plan coming together, a plan that would only work if the whole gang were to come back after the club. Jude wasn't the only one who could make surprise announcements. They sealed their agreement with a good night kiss, and another, and another....

Come the morning, Karen got a real thrill from waking up knowing that her clothes were in the wardrobe and not in her overnight bag. Knowing that she'd woken up in her bed, in her house, the one she shared with Jude. She went downstairs to her kitchen and made breakfast, using her pots and pans. It was wonderful to feel at home as she laid the table for two. By the time Jude came down she had everything ready; the coffee was all sorted and two full English breakfasts were just coming together under the grill.

And later, after the day's work, Jude was, once again, waiting outside for Karen, which was another thing she could get used to. It wasn't just that she didn't have to catch the bus, far from; it was far more that her evenings were, from now on, going to be filled with a shared life, not a lonely existence. They would go home and Karen would cook a meal for two, a meal she would share, a meal that would be an act of love. 

But it wasn't just Karen who was walking on air. Jude, too, was finding that the sun was shining more, that life was a little brighter. Even one of her colleagues commented on her good mood. The fact that he put it as 'What's wrong with you? You're normally such a grumpy cow,' was just part and parcel of the station banter and, for once, she didn't mind.

After their meal they got ready to go out. Karen noticed that Jude seemed to be taking just a little more trouble over her appearance and, when it was time to leave, Karen felt that Jude was looking just right, that she was going to be so proud to walk into the club accompanied by such a fine woman. 

"Are you ready?" Jude asked after the taxi had dropped them off.

"I've never been more so," Karen replied. Jude took her hand and they went on in. 

"Hi guys," Jude said as they approached the booth where the others were sitting. Just as they had wished, all the others were there, chatting together. They looked up to see Jude and Karen holding hands and there were smiles all round.

"I've... err... I've got an announcement to make," Jude continued.

Karen was a bit taken aback; wasn't this their announcement, not just Jude's?

"I've been more than a bit of a fool," Jude continued, "and, as you're probably all aware, I've been blind to the fact that the most wonderful woman in the world was in love with me and I with her. On Thursday she did me the honour of moving in with me. Today I want to ask her something more."

Jude fumbled in her jacket pocket and brought out a small box. She opened it up to reveal the ring inside before getting down on one knee in front of Karen.

"Karen, my love, my only, my sweet. Now that I've stopped being such a fool would you do me the honour of becoming my wife? Please, Karen, will you marry me?"

"Oh, Jude, oh, yes, oh yes, oh yes!" Karen replied. "But Jude, please, get off your knees, that's not where you belong. What will the other's think," she joked, "a Domme on her knees before her sub."

Jude stood up and, holding Karen tight, took her hand and fitted the ring. Karen felt she would burst with happiness, there was simply too much emotion going on inside her. Jude, as ever, hadn't stinted on the ring and the diamond sparkled. They kissed and then turned to the others to share their joy. Lucy, of course, was ecstatic at the news and couldn't help but remind everyone that it was she who had first introduced Karen to the club and, as such, she could take the credit for getting the two of them together. 

"We'd like you all to come back later," Jude said, once things had settled. There was an awkward pause and all eyes turned to Karen.

"Yes, please, all of you," Karen added, "please, we'd love you to."

"Of course, why wouldn't we," was the general response now that they knew that Karen was willing. "It is Friday after all."

Later on Lucy was, once again, admiring Karen's ring.

"Lucy, I need a favour," Karen said quietly.

"Of course, what do you need me to do?" Lucy asked.

"When we get back I want you and the other subs, well..." Quietly Karen outlined her plan and Lucy, as soon as she got the gist of it, was more than keen to join in. Indeed, a few minutes later she, Beth and Kathy disappeared to the toilets together and, when they came back, there were sly winks all round.

When they all arrived at Jude and Karen's house, Kathy announced to the Dommes that, should they take their places downstairs, their subs would be with them shortly. There was a certain amount of good humoured muttering but no one was going to deny anyone anything that night. The four subs went into the kitchen where Karen retrieved a shopping bag from the bottom of the fridge and another from behind the veg rack.

"You've no idea how hard it was to smuggle this lot past Jude," she commented. "I had to tell her it was food for the weekend."

She put the bags on the table and retrieved two bottles of champagne, some candles and a piece of white fabric. She opened up the fabric to reveal a full-length cloak in white satin with gold thread highlights.

"Wow, this is fabulous. When did you get this?" Lucy asked.

"Mel and I went into town during our lunch break. I don't how I'd have managed without her."

"You mean Mel knew about this all along!"

"Well, bits. Even I didn't know that Jude was going to propose."

"I'll kill her!"

"Please, Lucy, she promised not to tell. It's just that she wormed it out of me at work and then, when I needed to go shopping.... She said you'd be mad."

"Well, OK, if she promised." Lucy was only partially mollified but there were things to do and the Dommes were waiting. Kathy took the candles downstairs while Lucy, Beth and Karen all went upstairs to the bedroom to help Karen get out of her clothes and into the cloak. The cloak was quite straightforward; its long white folds reached almost to the ground and a simple gold chain at the throat held it together. Karen clasped her hands behind her back so that, as she moved, the cloak would swing open, framing and displaying her naked charms beneath. Lucy was both delighted for her friend and, truth be told, a little jealous. She might have to mither Mel for a similar garment. By the time Kathy returned, they had returned downstairs and were sorting out eight champagne glasses. Kathy quickly stripped off and then it was the time for the four of them to go downstairs to the playroom.

With Karen in front, Lucy and Beth as maids of honour and Kathy struggling slightly with the heavily laden tray, they went downstairs where, as Karen had planned, the candles gave the room a soft glow; just the atmosphere she had wanted. She went over and knelt in front of the thrones and Lucy and Beth reached down and removed the cloak.

Karen looked up at Jude and their eyes met. They shared a smile, this was right, this was proper; the sub knelt before her Domme, a naked supplicant, her body, her soul, her heart, her gift to the woman she loved. There was just one more piece of the jigsaw to put into place.

"Mistress Jude, Karen began, "today you asked me to be your wife and I accepted with all my heart. I am proud and honoured to wear your ring showing all the world that we will soon be married and I am yours and only yours from this day on.

"But, whilst the ring is for the world, this," Karen brought her hands out from behind her back and held out the necklace, the one that Jude had given her, "this I wear for you and you alone. I am your submissive, yours and only yours and I will not be complete unless you are my Mistress, you and you alone. Please, my darling, my love, my Mistress, my Jude, take me and make me yours."

Karen lifted up her hands, offering up the necklace, and then bowed her head. The room was silent, all of them lost in the moment. Jude reached down and took the necklace and just held it for a moment before placing it around Karen's neck and locking it tight. Then she put her hands either side of Karen's head, lifted it up and kissed her long and hard.

"Karen, my darling Karen," she replied, once the kiss was over, "now that I've found you how could I possibly want another? You are mine as I am yours. You honour me by wearing my necklace and I promise from the bottom of my heart to do all I can to honour you in return."

And then, words would never be enough. They looked at each other and just knew that, for evermore, they would be Judeandkaren, or possibly, Karenandjude. They both knew the others were there, that they were watching but this was their moment and they only knew each other. Jude reached out, took Karen's hand, and guided her up, onto her lap. Their kiss lingered on and on until, well, if it went any further then it needed to continue in private. Slightly embarrassed they broke apart and looked at the smiling faces all around them.

"I think this calls for some champagne," Jude announced. 


Epilogue - six months later.

"Well, you must be pleased with yourself, winning the award for best team performance," Mel said as they packed up after a full day's work.

"It's a team award," Karen replied firmly. "It's for all of us, we all won it, not just me."

"Yeah, well, of course, this lot," Mel waved her arm to indicate the desks around them, "they were doing so well before you took over, weren't they?"

"We just needed to find our direction."

"Nah, what we needed was a great big kick up the arse and that's what you gave us. I don't think any of us will forget that day. Quite a speech, even without you coming out."

"Well, it needed saying, for my sake as much as anyone else's. And talking of top performers, have you applied for that supervisor post yet? The closing date is pretty soon."

"I'm still not sure if I'm the right person."

"Well, I am. After all, we both know you're good at bossing people around." Karen gave Mel a friendly nudge and they both laughed. "Please, Mel, promise me you'll apply."

"OK, maybe I will," Mel wasn't used to being the uncertain one. "Changing the subject slightly, how are the wedding plans going? You've only got a couple of more weeks before the big day."

"I never knew that so much needed organising. If it weren't for your Lucy...."

"My Lucy is like a pig in shit and loving every second of it," Mel laughed. "On the other hand, if I see another bloody magazine all about wedding dresses I'll explode. What about," Mel knew she was getting onto sticky ground here, "what about your family? Have they made up their minds yet?"

"George is still a bit dubious, but Jess, she's decided that it's modern and trendy to go to your gay sister&#8217;s same-sex wedding and, apparently, she's boasting about it to all her neighbours. Wonders will never cease."

"I am pleased, really I am. It doesn't feel like a proper wedding unless your family are there. When Lucy and I got married, it really helped heal the wounds; dad never thought he'd finally get to dance with his daughter at her wedding, even if I was wearing a suit at the time. Nowadays mum keeps mithering us about grandkids and, if Lucy has her way, well, lets just say we're looking at options." 

"So, will we be seeing the two of you tonight?"

"Wouldn't miss it for the world. In fact, as Lucy has been driving me so scatty with wedding this and wedding that, I think a little short, sharp spanking might be in order. And, given that you just encourage her, I might ask Jude if she can't do the same for you."

"What, together, over the same horse, sort of thing," Karen asked tentatively but with a twinkle in her eye. It was clear that she was far from averse to this suggestion.

"I'm sure we can work something out and stay within your limits," Mel laughed. "Just because you're a fussy cow...."

"Mel, please...."

"OK, OK, I'm just winding you up. Actually you've changed Fridays, do you know that?"

"How do you mean?"

"You've made us all think about what we're doing and who we're doing it with. Before you came along it was all about the sex. Now... now it's more of a couples thing."

"I'm sorry, I didn't mean to ruin things, it's just... well, you know how I feel."

"But that's it, we all felt that way to some extent, it's just that nobody had the guts to say anything. You didn't ruin things, you just changed them, changed them for the better. I like it that Lucy is mine and mine alone." Mel glanced up at the clock. "Oh my god, is that the time! Gotta go, see you later, bye!"

And with that Mel dashed off. As Karen tidied away the last few items from her desk she felt content, happy in the knowledge that her partner, her Jude was waiting outside and that, come the evening, she would be spending time with her new-found friends, those who had become so special to her. And, if she were in for a smacked bottom later, well, that was all part of it as well. She was blissfully, gloriously happy as only a bride-to-be can be.
