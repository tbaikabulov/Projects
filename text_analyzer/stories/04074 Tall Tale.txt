&nbsp;

�I�ll never find someone to love,� Rachel thought in 

frustrated anger as she stabbed at the doorbell.� 

Moments crawled by before Javier answered.� He didn�t 

seem surprised to see her.

&nbsp;

�Date end early?� he asked with a half smile as she 

stormed past him into his small apartment.� It was 

almost comic to see them together.�
She was six-four 

and he was a full foot shorter.�
From a distance he 

could have passed as her son.

&nbsp;

�Damn and double-damn,� she said with venom as she 

plunked herself down at the table separating the 

kitchen from the living area.�
�All I want is a decent 

relationship.� Is that too much
to ask?�

&nbsp;

It was a rhetorical question.� He
didn�t answer.� 

Instead he said, �Coffee?�

&nbsp;

She shook her head sharply.�
Glorious blond hair 

swished in an angry swirl.� But
the anger wasn�t 

directed at him.� Javier had
become her confidant � 

her best friend actually.� She
loved spending time 

with him when their busy schedules would allow.� He 

was a great listener and a really deep thinker.� 

�Goddammit,� she exploded as he took the seat across 

from her, �do you know what that fuck-wad said to me?�

&nbsp;

Javier half-smiled again indicating with a slight 

raising of his eyebrows that he didn�t.�
He knew she 

was extremely pissed.� Normally,
she never used 

profanity.

&nbsp;

�He said he liked me as a friend.��
Her eyes flamed 

and then almost started tearing at the memory.� �Last 

month he said we had a future together and tonight he 

likes me as a friend.� Then the
jerk starts asking me 

about Betsy Grant.�

&nbsp;

Another eyebrow lift.

&nbsp;

�One of the cheerleaders.�
Betsy�s shorter than you 

for Christ sakes.�� Rachel
snorted in disgust and 

continued, �I finally find a tall guy who seems 

interesting and he turns out to be a snake.� Not only 

that, but he�s a wimp-snake.� You
should have seen the 

spineless rat�s expression while he was telling me all 

this. . . .�� And she was
off.� Talking with animation, 

waiving her hands, raising her voice.

&nbsp;

Javier listened with quiet intensity.�
Never 

interrupting.� He offered only an
occasional look of 

empathy or confusion.

&nbsp;

Rachel was tall, indeed.� But
more than that, she was 

exceptionally self-assured � almost domineering.� What 

a combination.� And it had really
crimped her social 

life, because despite her strong personality she was 

entirely feminine.� This was
obvious in just about 

everything she did.� In her style
of clothing, her 

walk, the fact that she�d kept her hair long even 

during her volleyball days.� She
was beautiful, she 

was graceful, but she was no pushover.�
Where was she 

going to find a boyfriend?� There
simply weren�t that 

many tall men around, even on a campus as large as 

theirs.� And she didn�t just want
a tall guy.� She 

wanted a strong personality.� A
partner.� She wanted 

a man who would make her really feel like a woman.

&nbsp;

Rachel slapped her palm down on the table to emphasize 

a point.� Javier didn�t
flinch.� As he listened he 

admired both her strength and her beauty.� They had 

met the year before during their first days in the 

graduate program.� They�d shared
a class, traded 

lecture notes, studied together.�
They had become 

close friends.� He was just as
strong and self assured 

as she but in a quieter, less flamboyant way.� She 

continued to talk; he listened and continued to say 

nothing.

&nbsp;

An hour later Rachel finally ran out of steam.� Javier 

nodded thoughtfully and let the silence build.� Then 

something happened that had never happened before.� 

She asked for his advice.� Oh,
she�d asked for and 

he�d given her lots of general advice about textbooks, 

travel, taxes.� But she�d never
before asked for his 

opinion about her personal life.

&nbsp;

�What should I do, Javier?� Join
a dating service?� 

Take out an ad in the personals?�
What?� I can�t go 

on like this forever.� I need
someone.� How am I 

going to find him?�� She sounded
almost drained.

&nbsp;

A long silence followed.� Javier
stared at the table.� 

Rachel waited.� He wasn�t like
the other men who had 

passed through her life � all mouth and no intellect.� 

She knew he�d really paid attention and was seriously 

considering his reply.� He never
offered a suggestion 

unless asked and never gave one lightly.� But when he 

did give advice it always seemed to work.� And he was 

honest enough to tell her when he didn�t know.� He 

never faked an answer.� So given
the nature of her 

problem she didn�t really expect him to have a 

solution.

&nbsp;

Rachel sat quietly, lost in moody thoughts.� She 

stared through a black window into the darkness.� 

Time passed.� Then she glanced
over and saw that 

Javier had been studying her.�
She arched her own 

delicate eyebrows.� �Well,� she
seemed to ask.

&nbsp;

�Do you trust me?� he finally offered.

&nbsp;

�Of course,� she replied almost without thinking.

&nbsp;

Javier studied her face as if looking for something he 

couldn�t find.� He repeated the
question with emphasis, 

�Do you TRUST me?�� His voice was
quiet but compelling.

&nbsp;

�What was this?� Rachel wondered.�
But she considered 

the question carefully, and came up with the same 

answer.� �Yes, I do, Javier.� I trust you completely.�

&nbsp;

He nodded to himself, looked away, and remained in 

silent thought for a few more moments.

&nbsp;

�OK,� he said.� �I�ll be right
back.�� Then he stood 

and walked away leaving her bewildered.�
She heard 

his bedroom door open and the sound of rummaging.

&nbsp;

He was back a couple minutes later holding what looked 

like the sash from his bathrobe.

&nbsp;

�Stand up,� he said in a voice of quiet command.

&nbsp;

Rachel stood.� She looked at him
questioningly.

&nbsp;

He studied her for a long minute.�
She truly was 

magnificent.� Tall, beautiful, in
wonderful physical 

shape.� She had worn a lacy pink
blouse on her date 

with a matching blue jacket and skirt.�
She also had 

on high heels.� He smiled.� Six-four and wearing 

heels.� He knew they made her
feel more feminine.

&nbsp;

�Turn around,� he said.

&nbsp;

�What do you have in mind?� she asked.

&nbsp;

He smiled.� �You said you trusted
me. . . .� So 

trust me.�

&nbsp;

She tried to read his face but couldn�t.� She glanced 

down at the sash.� Then, taking a
deep breath and 

biting a nervous lip she turned.�
He came up behind 

her, removed her jacket, and hung it on the back of 

the chair where she�d been sitting.�
Reaching over he 

took one of her hands, gently pulling it behind her, 

and began tying the sash around her wrist.

&nbsp;

For a moment, a newspaper headline flashed through her 

head: �CO-ED FOUND STRANGLED.��
�What would her mother 

say?�� But she really did trust
him.� She swallowed as 

he took her other hand, pulled it back and began 

binding her wrists together.

&nbsp;

When he was finished he gently turned her around to 

face him.� He was smiling.� She was about to say 

something but he shushed her.�
�Don�t talk or I�ll 

gag you.�� Something in his voice
told her he was 

serious.� She tested the binding
and knew she wasn�t 

getting loose until he let her go.

&nbsp;

Javier reached up and gently stroked the side of 

Rachel�s face.� She closed her
eyes and let herself 

drink in the sensation.� She felt
more vulnerable 

then she could ever remember.�
She kept her eyes 

closed, swaying uncertainly in her heels, as reaching 

up with the other hand he began undoing the buttons 

of her blouse.

&nbsp;

Rachel trembled.

&nbsp;

One by one he nimbly unfastened each button.� She felt 

his touch through the cloth of her blouse or brushing 

her bare skin with the back of his fingers.� She found 

it surprisingly erotic.

&nbsp;

Her trembling increased but she held her ground.

&nbsp;

Carefully pulling her blouse out from where it tucked 

into her skirt, he undid the last button.� Then 

reaching under the silky cloth he slowly and sensually 

begin to rub her sides.� He
tweaked a nipple through 

her bra.� She quietly
gasped.� He was rewarded by 

seeing the little bud erupt beneath the fabric.� He 

rubbed some more and then tweaked the other nipple.� 

Rachel felt a definite response between her thighs.� 

She�d been with several boys and men in her life but 

nothing before had ever made her feel like this.

&nbsp;

Javiar reached in and around and with a deft flick of 

his fingers unlatched her bra.�
Rachel had very nice 

breasts.� Not huge but large
enough and extremely well 

formed.� So when the bra was
unhooked it rode up a bit 

exposing the bottom of each globe.�
He ran his finger 

along the sensitive skin on the underside.� A quiet 

moan escaped her lips.� He pealed
the bra up and 

palmed first one and then the other fleshy orb.� 

Leaning forward he sucked a nipple into his mouth 

and toyed with it as he pinched the other with 

tender force.

&nbsp;

Rachel sucked in her breath and opened her eyes.� She 

hadn�t ever thought of Javier romantically.� She 

looked at him as if for the first time.�
He might not 

be the most handsome man in the world but he was well 

built for his size.� And he
wasn�t bad to look at.

&nbsp;

Rachel was having a little trouble keeping her balance 

in the heels because of the storm of hormones being 

unleashed by Javier�s tongue and fingers.� He stopped 

and looked directly into her eyes.�
She could never 

read his thoughts through that funny half-smile.� 

Taking hold of her belt he carefully led her to his 

bedroom.� She�d seen the room
many times through the 

open door but she�d never actually been inside.� It 

was nice.� Clean and simple.� The room was small.� 

But the bed was huge, consisting mostly of a large 

flat mattress with an ornate brass headboard.� The 

covers had been swept off to one side where they lay 

in a jumble on the floor.� All
that was left was the 

bottom sheet and a few pillows.�
He maneuvered her to 

the side of the bed and stood her there.

&nbsp;

The kissing and licking continued as her belt was 

undone and her skirt unzipped.�
The garment fell to 

the floor around her feet.�
Javier pulled her 

pantyhose down and helped her to sit.�
Getting down 

on one knee he removed her heels and pantyhose.� Then 

she was surprised as he slipped the heels back onto 

her bare feet.� He laid her on
her back with her head 

on a pillow and arranged her comfortably.� Or as 

comfortably as she could be with her hands tied behind 

her and her blouse and bra still dangling around her 

arms.� He collected her other
clothes and put them on 

the dresser.

&nbsp;

She watched as he removed his own clothes until he was 

completely naked.� Rachel found
she was a little bit 

frightened.� But that was
silly.� He wasn�t going to 

hurt her and the worst that would happen would be that 

they would have sex.� �The worst
that would happen.�� 

The phrase bounced around in her head.�
Would that be 

bad?� She wasn�t sure.� �Trust me.�

&nbsp;

Rachel didn�t know how she felt about what was about 

to happen.� But as Javier climbed
into the bed she 

felt a powerful surge of lust.�
Lying on her back with 

her hands tied, some of her clothing hanging loosely 

around her torso, and with her high heels still on, 

she felt small and awkward and powerless.� Javier, 

looming above her in the subdued reflected light from 

the far room was a ghostly figure.�
A demon or an 

angel?� She couldn�t tell.

&nbsp;

He leaned down and kissed her.�
She closed her eyes 

and let him.� The feel of his
lips and tongue playing 

around hers was a powerful turn-on.�
His hands were 

on and around her breasts again, running lightly over 

her exposed skin.� She spread her
legs a little without 

even realizing she was doing so.�
She felt her own 

moisture and heat.

&nbsp;

He shifted position and began kissing the side of her 

neck.� He was incredibly skilled
at this.� She felt 

his hand slide down, past her breasts, across her 

belly, and come tantalizingly close to her public 

mound.� For minutes he did
nothing but vary the 

foreplay.� Rachel could feel the
heat of a rash 

creeping from her chest up to her chin.

&nbsp;

Javier stopped and left Rachel panting.�
He 

repositioned himself so that he was sitting on her 

belly.� Leaning forward, he
kissed her again.� She 

could feel his body pressing into hers.�
The hair on 

his chest stimulated her breasts and sent a new fire 

of lust through her.� She
suddenly realized, almost 

as a shock, that she wanted him to fuck her.� But with 

her hands tied she had no power.�
He had complete 

control and was driving her to a higher pinnacle of 

desire than she�d never known.

&nbsp;

He moved his legs between hers and sensually slid down 

her body.� As he kissed her
breasts again she could 

feel his penis slide through the now wet valley of 

flesh between her legs.� But he
didn�t enter her.� He 

kept moving downward until he was completely between 

her legs and his hot breath was washing over the wet 

flesh of her sex.� She didn�t
feel his tongue but she 

felt his fingers.� She felt her
lower lips being 

spread.� A finger dipped in and
out of her several 

times and then began to erotically circle her vagina 

and anus.� She found herself
almost trying to hump 

his hand as her pelvis seemed to take on a rhythmic 

life of its own.

&nbsp;

He spent long minutes just toying with her.� Playing 

with his fingers.� Letting her
feel his breath on her 

super-sensitive flesh.� By now
she was covered in a 

sheen of sweat.� Her breathing
was labored.� She felt 

an intense desire to come.

&nbsp;

And just when she thought she couldn�t take it anymore, 

he buried his face in her sex and began to stimulate 

her clitoris with his lips and tongue.�
�Oh God!� That 

was incredible.�� No one had ever
taken this much 

time and effort to turn her on.�
For the first time 

in her sexual life, she was the complete center of 

attention.� She had never known
anyone with such 

skills.� She had never felt so
small and helpless.

&nbsp;

He brought her to the crest of an orgasm but stopped 

before she came.� She
groaned.� He plunged a finger 

into her, licked her clit some more, and moved his 

finger like a penis until she was again on the edge.� 

And again he stopped before she came.�
Her bound 

hands were balled into fists.� He
moved his finger 

down and circled her anus again, licking sideways 

against her clit as he did so.�
She gasped and 

pressed her pelvis upward against his face.� It was 

difficult getting leverage while wearing the heels.� 

She had a fleeting thought that she might puncture his 

mattress.� He moved his hand back
up and this time 

pushed two fingers into her.�
Despite her height, her 

sex organs were of average size.�
She was tight and 

as his fingers pressed deeply into her as his tongue 

went back to work.

&nbsp;

Rachel�s mouth opened wide.� Her
breathing was deep 

and fast.� She didn�t know
whether to laugh or scream 

or cry.� The feelings were
incredible.� She�d never 

climaxed during sex before.� She
learned how to make 

herself come but only when masturbating in private.� 

This was amazingly different.

&nbsp;

His free hand wormed its way under her back and grasped 

one of her cuffed hands.� She
gripped him so fiercely 

she was afraid she might hurt him.�
But he squeezed 

back with astonishing force of his own.�
He pressed 

his lips quite strongly against her clit.� He pushed 

his two fingers into her � hard, hard, hard.� His 

tongue was whipping her clit with deliberate power.

&nbsp;

And it happened.

&nbsp;

There were no words to describe it.�
Her mouth was open 

but she couldn�t breath.� Her
pelvis had ridden high up 

against his mouth.� She screamed
silently once, . . . 

twice, . . . a third time as muscle contractions 

overcame her.� She started
breathing again and heard 

the most astounding sounds of passion.�
Was that 

really her?

&nbsp;

Javier had ridden her climax with consummate skill.� 

Drawing it out, maximizing the pleasure, tapering off 

before it became painful or unpleasant.

&nbsp;

Rachel found she was crying.�
Blubbering in fact.� That 

had been sooo good.� She didn�t
know what to do.

&nbsp;

Javier lifted his face and blew a stream of cool air 

over her wet sex.� She gasped at
the new sensation and 

continued to cry.� He rolled her
over onto her belly 

and untied her hands.� He removed
her shoes.� Tenderly 

he stripped off her now damp blouse.�
Rolling her on 

her side he removed her bra.

&nbsp;

Once naked and on her side, Javier snuggled up behind 

her.� His face rested against the
back of her neck.� 

His still hard penis pressed against the top of her 

ass.� He had placed one arm
protectively over her and 

was softly cupping a breast.� As
she wept he cooed 

soothingly in her ear, �Shhh, shhh, shhh� and 

delicately rubbed the side of her breast with his 

thumb.

&nbsp;

Rachel was almost limp.� She was
still weeping and 

didn�t know why.

&nbsp;

�Shhh, shhh, shhh.�

&nbsp;

Eventually she became quiet.� For
a long, long time 

neither moved.� At first she
couldn�t seem to think at 

all.� Then she wondered why he
had stopped there.� Why 

hadn�t he entered her?� Was this
some kind of 

rejection?� Of course not.� In a flash of understanding 

she realized his only concern had been for her.� A new 

emotion hit her like a wave.� She
felt loved.� Her 

tears began flowing once more.�
She really felt loved.

&nbsp;

Rachel reached down for the leg pressed up against hers.� 

It was a strong, well muscled leg.�
She moved her hand 

behind her back and felt his penis.�
It had softened 

considerably but was still inflated.�
She gently 

fondled it and felt it spring to full life.

&nbsp;

Rachel moved her other arm under and behind her.� She 

brought her wrists together and grasped his penis with 

both hands.� She again felt his
power and her own 

helplessness.

&nbsp;

Javier waited.

&nbsp;

Rachel shifted position, skooched up, and spread her 

legs a bit.� She tried to
position him into her from 

behind.� Once Javier was sure of
her intention he sat 

up and rolled her over onto her belly.�
Without a word 

or gesture from him, she had left her wrists pressed 

together at the base of her spine.

&nbsp;

He retied her wrists and massaged her clit until she 

was hot and ready again.� Then
positioning himself 

between her legs he entered her doggy style.� She felt 

him pumping with long measured strokes and could feel 

his balls swinging up against her clit.�
It wouldn�t 

take a whole lot of that before she came a second time.

&nbsp;

He loved her.� That much was
clear.� He loved her, and 

he wanted her, and he knew how to care for her.� 

Javier knew how to make her feel like a woman.� Her 

mind was in a whorl.� How did she
feel about that?

&nbsp;

As Javier hit his stride she heard the passion in his 

breathing and felt the lust in his movements.� She felt 

his body rhythmically pressing against her cuffed hands 

and knew she was in love.
