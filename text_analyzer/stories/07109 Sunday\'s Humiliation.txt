Synopsis: a slave is late home, resulting in a rather embarresing punishment.






She walked slowly into the room as she placed her collar around her neck, her heart beating fast, knowing that he was waiting for her.
"You're late," he snapped.
"I'm sorry, I lost track of time," she stammered.
A long moment of silence passed before he finally spoke.
"So not only are you late, you no longer know how to address me either?"
She looked away as she realized her error.
"I'm sorry, Master." she said quietly.
"You seem to be saying alot of that lately," he responded.
She stayed quiet, waiting for him to continue speaking.
"In there. Now." He ordered, pointint to the other room.
She hesitantly made her way in, knowing what was coming.
"Pants down," he told her as he picked up the cane.
She did so immediately, and placed herself in posistion before he delievered three hard strokes.&nbsp; After each stroke, she said, "Thank you, Master."
Upon the third, she squirmed and he informed her she could have an extra two for moving. She fought to stay still as he delievered the final two before telling her to fasten her pants and stand up.
Resisiting the urge to grab onto her redding ass, she stood up, placing her hands behind her back and looked at him, waiting.
"That was for failing to address me. You'll be punished later for being late. Understood?"
"Yes, Master."
"Good. Now get ready."
Sometime later, she was ready to go out and waited by the door.
He came over to her, and lifting her skirt, placed the weight balls inside her and ordered her to leave them there until further notice. He then proceeded to remove the collar from around her neck, knowing that she wasn't ready to out in it yet, before leading her out of the door.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*
A few hours later, as they made their way out of the pub, talking and laughing, he suddenly stopped and turned to her.
"Are you ready for your punishment now?" He asked.
She stayed quiet, unsure of what to say. She'd been hoping that he had forgotten about her lateness, but clearly he hadn't.
"Well?" he asked.
"Yes, Master, " She replied softly.
"Ask for it."
She fought back the urge to reply sarcastically, knowing that it would only bring more discipline, before she answered,
"Please punish me, Master."
"For what?"
She sighed to herself inaudibly.
Was he really going to make her ask and beg?
Looking up at him, she could see he was being serious and answered,
"For being late this morning, Master. Please will you punish me?"
"Well since you asked so nicely," He said, with a touch of humor in his tone.
"Pee."
She frowned slightly, unsure of how to respond.
"Now." He said, in a harsher tone. "And continue walking while you do so."
She waited a few seconds, arguing with herself over whether she should do as he said.
As she debated, she remembered the morning's earlier spanking and reluctantly started to walk.
Now she understood why he had ordered her not to use the bathroom while they were out, and why he had wanted her to wear a skirt.
He walked next to her, waiting silently, and after a few more moments she felt the pee begin to trickle down her legs.
He smiled as she wet herself, her eyes on the floor, and could clearly see the embarresment in her face.
"That's it, pee like the little slut that you are," He ordered.
She stayed silent, her embaressment becoming more and more obvious as she felt the pee rushing down her legs and onto her feet and the floor.
As he waved down a taxi, she wondered if he was going to make her get in how she was, and flushed when she realized that was his intention.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*
Once home, he slipped her collar back on, and then he informed her to wait in the living room, before he disappeared for a few moments, returning with restraints and a gag, which he placed in her mouth, and then lifted her hands above her head before cuffing them together.
"You are to stay like that until further notice," was his only words before he disappeared into the bedroom.
She stood there silently, wishing more than anything that she could shower and get changed.
Her wet skirt clung to her, reminding her of what she had done, and of how she had disobeyed.
Fifteen minutes later he returned to find her in the exact same position that he had left her, and gently removed the gag from her mouth.
"Have you anything to say, slut?"
"I'm sorry I was late this morning, Master," she replied immediately. "And I'm sorry that I didn't address you correctly."
He stared at her for a long moment before odering her into the shower.
When she came out of the bathroom she found him lay down in bed, and immediately went over and knelt next to him, waiting for him to speak.
After a few minutes he told her she was allowed to get into bed.
She did so, and as she lay next to him, he asked,
"Have you anything else you wish to say, slut?"
"Thank you, Master."
