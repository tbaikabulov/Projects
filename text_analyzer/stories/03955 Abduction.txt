Abduction


She stood at the window of her apartment bedroom, staring out into the night.&nbsp; Absently, she set her mug of fragrant, steaming tea on the windowsill with a quiet, precise clink.&nbsp; The darkened room at her back perfectly suited her pensive mood.
She sensed a presence behind her.&nbsp; Probably L, she thought, and without turning, she asked, �What do you want?�
A subtle scent of some unknown perfume was her only warning, jolting her out of her reverie as a female voice whispered, �You,� and a heavy cloth bag was thrown over her head, the opening twisted tight about her neck.&nbsp; Kara, ever a fighter, threw herself backwards, intending to knock her unknown assailant to the ground and startle her into loosening her grip on the hood that was beginning to choke her.
The attacker sidestepped to the right, shifting her grip on the hood to grab a fistful of Kara&#8217;s long hair as well.&nbsp; This grip, with the attacker&#8217;s step to the side, twisted Kara&#8217;s head cruelly to the left, causing her to stagger and turn to relieve the pain in her scalp and neck.&nbsp; Overbalancing, Kara dropped to one knee and caught herself on her left arm.&nbsp; The attacker took advantage of Kara&#8217;s fall and grabbed Kara&#8217;s right arm as she flailed for balance, wrenching the limb back to bend Kara forward.
Suddenly a third hand insinuated itself into the struggle.&nbsp; This second attacker snatched Kara&#8217;s left arm, upon which she&#8217;d been leaning since she&#8217;d fallen scant seconds ago.&nbsp; Deprived of any support save for her assailants&#8217; hands on her arms and the grip on hood and hair, Kara pitched forward helplessly, aided by a knee in her back, to sprawl facedown on the carpet.
She felt her breath coming shorter, and bursts of color sparkled behind her eyes.&nbsp; In some part of her mind, she realized that the material of the hood had been soaked with some pungent chemical, and she was going to pass out.&nbsp; Dimly she felt her wrists being taped together behind her back with what sounded like duct tape, and she wriggled in a final, futile struggle for freedom.
Just before unconsciousness claimed her, she heard a soft, wicked laugh, and the same voice that had first spoken to her murmured, �Good night, pet.�


Kara came fully back to herself some time later.&nbsp; As her senses returned, she began to take stock of her situation.
She was naked.&nbsp; The movement of cool air over her skin reinforced this sensation, as did the chill tile floor in direct contact with her body.&nbsp; Her wrists were still taped together behind her, and her elbows were forced as close to one another as they could go and taped as well.&nbsp; Her ankles, too, were similarly bound.&nbsp; The hood was gone, but she was still engulfed in darkness, and the area about her eyes stung like fury, although she couldn&#8217;t have said why.&nbsp; Her mouth was stuffed full with a piece of cloth, and another strip of duct tape sealed her lips shut.
Moving carefully, Kara rolled up to kneel upright, doing her best to ignore the coldness and stiffness of her bound limbs.&nbsp; Her more immediate worry was her lack of vision.&nbsp; She felt no blindfold tied about her head, yet when she blinked her eyelashes brushed against some barrier.&nbsp; And that strange pain around her eye-sockets�she suddenly shuddered, as she remembered something she&#8217;d read awhile ago, about the use of suturing and stitching in bondage sex.&nbsp; What have they done to me??&nbsp; Her terrified mind flailed, rebelling against the seeming conclusion.&nbsp; 
Lost as she was in her panic, she failed to hear the footsteps behind her until a hand trailed softly over her hair.&nbsp; �Calm yourself, pet.&nbsp; If you&#8217;re panicking like this, you&#8217;re of no use to me.&nbsp; And I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;d prefer to be of use, wouldn&#8217;t you, little one?�
It was the same voice she remembered from her abduction!&nbsp; She twisted toward the voice, as if seeking its source.&nbsp; 
The hand stroked her hair again, nails rasping gently against her scalp.&nbsp; Despite her fear, she found the sensation pleasant, and leaned into it slightly.&nbsp; The woman laughed again.&nbsp; �Already so eager, pet?�&nbsp; Kara froze upon hearing this, realizing what she&#8217;d done.
The nails drifted down the back of her neck, then over her shoulder and across her throat.&nbsp; Shivers rippled through Kara at this touch.&nbsp; She could nearly hear the smile in her captor&#8217;s voice as the woman spoke.&nbsp; �Yes, you&#8217;re going to be great fun to train, my pet.�
Suddenly the touch was removed.&nbsp; Kara turned her head this way and that, trying to discern where the woman had gone.&nbsp; Terrifying as she was, she was also, as far as Kara knew, the only other living soul near her, and even that was a comfort.&nbsp; There was a slight scraping sound, as of a chair being dragged across a floor, and Kara turned her face toward it.
�So, little pet, I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;re just full of questions right now.&nbsp; However, I have no use for your mouth just yet, so you&#8217;ll remain gagged for the time being.&nbsp; I will, however, try to answer some of the questions you probably want to ask.�
�First of all, I should explain what has happened to you.&nbsp; I&#8217;ve been watching you for awhile, little one.&nbsp; You caught my eye at a party a few months ago; though I&#8217;m sure you didn&#8217;t know I was there.&nbsp; I saw how you responded to your boyfriend whenever he gave you instructions on things.&nbsp; And I saw in you a strong will, coupled with innate submissiveness.&nbsp; It&#8217;s a combination that&#8217;s always fascinated me.&nbsp; And so I watched you, and after a while, I decided I had to have you.&nbsp; So I&#8217;ve had you abducted, brought you here, and you are now mine.�
�I should also explain your new situation, pet.&nbsp; You are now my property.&nbsp; Unequivocally.&nbsp; There will be no way for you to escape &#8211; any attempts to do so will result in extremely harsh punishment, which I shall demonstrate to you later, so that you&#8217;ll know what you risk if you disobey me.&nbsp; You will obey my every order &#8211; again, defiance will be met with the strictest of discipline.&nbsp; You will have to learn to trust me, pet, since I will be the center of your universe, after all.&nbsp; I will provide you with food, when and how I choose, I will decide when, where, and how you are allowed to sleep and void yourself, I will be your only source of both pain and pleasure.�
�To emphasize this, I&#8217;ve had your eyes patched over.&nbsp; Those patches sewn over your eyes may or may not be temporary; I&#8217;ll decide later.&nbsp; You have no need to see anymore, after all.&nbsp; All you need to do is obey.&nbsp; This will teach you to properly rely on me.�
�You no longer have a name, either.&nbsp; All I will ever address you as is &#8216;pet&#8217;, or &#8216;little one&#8217;, or some variation on those.&nbsp; Property, after all, has no need to be named.�
Tears soaked Kara&#8217;s eye-patches &#8211; tears of fear, tears of sorrow, tears of loss.&nbsp; At one blow, her entire life had been taken from her.&nbsp; She could see no way out.&nbsp; All that was left for her was to be the pet-slave to a complete stranger, and hope for gentle treatment.&nbsp; However, her new owner spoke on, ignoring her pet&#8217;s emotional distress.
�I will be using your mouth regularly, of course, so&nbsp; you won&#8217;t be deprived use of it forever.&nbsp; But when I do ungag you, I will expect you to address me with the utmost degree of respect and adoration.&nbsp; My name is Lina, however, you will address me as Mistress.&nbsp; And you will not speak unless spoken to, is that understood?&nbsp; Nod if you understand all of this so far.�&nbsp; Kara nodded.&nbsp; �Good, little pet.&nbsp; I knew you&#8217;d be easily trained.�&nbsp; Kara whimpered softly, despairingly.
Kara heard the quiet hiss of clothing shifting as her owner stood again, and this time Kara listened and heard her owner&#8217;s steps coming toward her.&nbsp; Her owner stood over her, close enough that Kara&#8217;s face nearly touched her owner&#8217;s thighs, close enough for Kara to feel her warmth and catch the slight musk of her owner&#8217;s arousal.&nbsp; Kara&#8217;s breathing quickened�but only partly out of fear.&nbsp; Horrified, she realized that some part of her was actually aroused by this!&nbsp; 
�Mmm, such a perfect reaction,� Lina murmured.&nbsp; Kara suppressed a sob, realizing that her owner could already read her tiniest reactions.&nbsp; �You&#8217;re still fighting it, aren&#8217;t you, pet?� Lina asked.&nbsp; Kara shook her head violently, not to deny that she was fighting her own body&#8217;s betrayal, but to deny that there was anything to fight at all.&nbsp; Lina simply laughed.&nbsp; �Little pet, you should learn this now,� she said softly, reaching down to pet Kara&#8217;s hair again, then suddenly digging her fingers in and wrenching Kara&#8217;s head back forcibly.&nbsp; �You cannot hide these things from me &#8211; and it will go much, much harder on you if you do,� Lina added, her mouth bare inches from Kara&#8217;s ear.&nbsp; Kara trembled in her Mistress&#8217;s grip, and gasped when the tip of Lina&#8217;s tongue swept along the curve of her ear.&nbsp; 
�Now, pet.&nbsp; It&#8217;s time for you to go to bed, so I&#8217;m going to put you in the cage that will become your new home.&nbsp; But tomorrow, your training will begin.�
