Seraphima Too

(by
Eve Adorer)

&nbsp;

Chapter 1 � Pool

&nbsp;

The petals
of a flower? No rosebud could so
comport. The mouth outbids the bud of mere rose to compose the kiss in repose
on heaven�s face.

&nbsp;

The eyes like the mouth
momentarily gaze unseeing.

&nbsp;

Reverie? Revere
the eyes brown, and the eye�s brown.

&nbsp;

She shines? Her complexion
is smooth and soft and hot in the glaring sun: sun that has lost the fight to
out-glow her glory.

&nbsp;

Distracted? Those she runs
down her bare right thigh, lost in thought, are long lithe and lingering
fingers. She is feeling herself without consciously feeling, and yet finding no
disappointment in her presentation.

&nbsp;

Sighs? Soft too, and cause
for the birds to stop singing, as they know they cannot compete with the sound
of a girl.

&nbsp;

Curls? Significantly
magnificent: coiffure of natural springs in coils as brown as black, that kiss
her forehead when the breeze teases and pleases to toy them, and dangle below
her shoulder-blades or dandle before her eyes from where she must sweep them
back with her sweet hand.

&nbsp;

Arms? Slender shapely slim, tender in
embrace holding you to the heart of her heart.

&nbsp;

Legs? She has been training ballet in gymnasium and is
strong and long and lissom and listen:
you have never seen such curves as her calves serve to swerve, or such power as
her thighs curve to serve.

&nbsp;

Breasts? Wholly holy: twice and twin: pink-brown tipped
mounted mountains, independently minded to wander their wonder as she but
breathes, heaving breathtaking breast swaying uplifting breast breaths.

&nbsp;

Face? Angel
outshining. The mouth lips petals in pose of rose in repose, below nose
with slightly flared nostrils, below eyes with lightly hooded lids suggesting
haughtiness in contrast with truth: lids that bid to save us from the searing
of the sincerity of her gaze into our souls, and the fire that lights the world
with the delight of girl when she smiles, and the world knows no greater wonder
to ponder, because girl is also the other six yonder.

&nbsp;

Tendrils? Her pubic hair dandles six-feet-long down between
her worshipful thighs, and flutters its devil-brown curls in snake wriggle
wiggle in the breeze, as its completely compelling copious hopeless complexity
totally hides her southern mouth, coiling down in bubbling curls to saint the
poolside floor flawlessly.

&nbsp;

Draping her peacock tail in
trail of inescapably erotic drape like cape on the poolside�s
white tiles, the inestimable Seraphima wiggles her
wonderful wonder to the edge, and blesses the water with plash of her naked
glory, as she divides and diverts the water, when she swims to relieve the heat
from the sun�s endeavours to compete with her, and
inability to admit defeat by her.

&nbsp;

Thereafter, dripping
kissing-pearl-tears, opalescent cadences runnelling
her black body, she shakes her head pre-towel�s embrace, and makes a rainbow
hello halo. She then reached down to wring out her pubic nether-crown, gathering
her profoundly erotic despotically-brown ringlets in long fingers with
impractically long nails.

&nbsp;

The left hand with which she
wrings is ringed single, with gold it sports: her distaff wedding ring, singing
of her marriage to the living breathing million smiles of the lovely Marina Ntebeli. For the newly twenty-five-year-old Seraphima, with the four-year new growth of her girl
confirming curls, is now Mrs
Marina Ntebeli, and the luckiest girl alive to be so
four-year-wived.

������.

&nbsp;

�Hi� smiled Marina, the epitome of love, after she had ignored the
dripping wetness of her wife, Seraphima, and kissed
the naked wonder on her god�s own lips with the kiss of two girls long-since
mated and married and daily in each other�s company.

&nbsp;

The kiss was perfunctory but
not unprofound, as wife kissed wife by the poolside
found.

&nbsp;

�Have you been by the pool
all day? Marina smiled, as Marina always but always smiled, for Marina was the smile of love.

&nbsp;

�Almost�, Seraphima answered distractedly, as she continued to pat
towel dry her pubic tail.

&nbsp;

Marina sat showing an appreciable appreciateable
expanse of thighs from her miniskirt�s slow rise: �I�ve taken the afternoon
off. After all it is your birthday. I thought we could take a boat out on
lovely old Lake Charlotte, just like we did last year on your birthday darling� I�ve got Camilleona lined up to do the oaring, while you and I relax
in the sun together for a change.�

&nbsp;

The stoppage was
infinitesimal. Innocent Marina
seemingly didn�t notice that the towel halted its patting dry of the dripping
pearls from the hirsute curls of the hair that confirmed Seraphima
as the supreme of girls. Nor did she notice Seraphima�s
nipples flicker, as the black angel looked up momentarily, and then renewed her
concentration on drying her nude body.

&nbsp;

Was the name �Camilleona� a trigger?

&nbsp;

The fiery Italian fury had
been the family maid this past year. She had been the replacement for the
replacement for Seraphima, when Seraphima
had accepted Marina�s offer of marriage. 

&nbsp;

The raven-haired Camilleona had been ablaze in the market place. Hanging a human haunch from a hook that her tied wrists dangled her
from. As Marina had examined her thighs, squeezing them to inspect
them for acceptable strength to accompany their evident beauty, she had spat
out her incandescent anger with Italian phrases it was fortunate that her two
would-be buyers had no ken of.

&nbsp;

Meanwhile wife Seraphima had giggled at the incongruity, of this feisty
fury fighting kicking and cursing, whilst hanging as market meat hopelessly
helpless in her bonds, and crawled over by swarms of
flies feasting on her sweaty nipples and invading her pungent unwashed snatch. 

&nbsp;

The purchase was inevitable.
To tame this nineteen-year-old hissing-cat was a challenge neither wife nor
wife could resist. Besides, Camilleona was stunningly
attractive.

������

&nbsp;

Camilleona was supremely intelligent too. She had picked up
good English within a month of service. The main benefit of her doing so
however, was that her volcanic eruptions, as she conducted crescendo orchestra
with her lovely arms waiving and dainty feet stomping, in her frequent
tantrums, were now copiously sprinkled with sexily Italianated-English curses.

&nbsp;

She was a superb maid. She
looked after both Seraphima and Marina with love and
dedication. Despite that she was constantly incendiary,
her lovely outbursts were rarely against her mistresses as opposed to the
inanimate.

&nbsp;

No meal she prepared, was seen by Camilleona
as anything less than an international incident. Yet the delicious food she
served was coincident, and a compliment to her skill.

&nbsp;

To tame her a little, and
just about sufficiently, Marina
had had, more than once, and very severely, to spank Camilleona�s
lovely olive-brown-complexioned bottom.

&nbsp;

Tears and cries that revenge
was certain and sure, and would not be short of nuclear warfare if she were not
let go, were accompanied by a kicking of supremely lovely legs that saw her
twenty-inch heeled mules hit the ceiling, as she fought and wailed and railed
at her bottom being reddened for her being naughty, and kicked her lovely legs
like a thoroughbred in sight of the winning post.

&nbsp;

Here and now, Camilleona wiggled into the scene. She wore a maid�s outfit
made for her svelte figure. In black with a tiny white apron and with excess of
ribbons and feminine frills at its hem and short-sleeved puff-sleeved
shoulders, she filled it with her thrills.

&nbsp;

Her slender arms bare and
beautiful with soft dark down all down her gasp-making forearms, led to doll-sized
hands with which she would shortly lift her already extremely short hem when
she curtsied.

&nbsp;

Her long slim legs were on
tiptoe in her heelless ballerina shoes, and kissed by red fishnet stockings.
Her lime-green suspenders hauled her stocking tops into victory Vs at the sides
of her flowing flanks. The bib of her dress and squared-off plunge neckline,
with a quarter-cup bra beneath, presented her tits en-prise
as they combined to ease them up and squeeze them up as if they would pop out
at any longed-for second.

&nbsp;

First and second, both
breasts beckoned bosomically becomingly, as Camilleona sexily seared: �Good afternoon my ladies�, with
a curtsey that flashed a fiery yellow thong bursting with pod-lips that sang a
bedtime song never ever allied to any lullaby.

&nbsp;

�Camilleona!
You are supposed to be down at the boat house�, Marina mildly reminded with intoned surprise.

&nbsp;

In response, the delectable Camilleona sang soprano with succulent seductiveness in
rising ire and fire, she inspired from her very soul, as her arms whirled wild
wind and her head shook and nodded together and her lovely mouth demanded it be
stopped with a kiss, whilst her sapphire blue eyes shone with demonic ruby
diamonds as she rose to a crescendo: ��Ow I be at
boat �ouse when I �ere and you demand of me I be �ere
and there and everywhere for you and Mistress Seraphima
too, and I do my best and you tell Camilleona she in
wrong place wherever she be and Camilleona try and be
good girl and be where she is said, only you change mind like windmill spin and
Camilleona not know if she come or go and I love work
for you and Miss Seraphima but now I �ate it, because
you tell me always I be where I not supposed be, and not tell me where I
supposed to be till I be where I not supposed to be, and Camilleona
made to look naughty girl when she try so �ard to be
good girl and please you and Miss Seraphima, and I
not know now whether Camilleona come or go being,
because you no make up mind where Camilleona supposed
to be and it no wonder I confused�.�.

&nbsp;

Marina took both the lovely maids pretty hands to calm her.

&nbsp;

Camilleona blushed at the loving touch, but her eyes still
threatened welder�s arc burn, and her artless heart-shaped face had turned a
delicious red, as much from her blushes as the rushes of her hair-trigger fury.

&nbsp;

�Camilleona.
Please go to the boat house and prepare for Miss Seraphima�s
birthday treat�, Marina sighed, as she kissed the hands to calm the feminine
eruption�s disruption.

&nbsp;

�Camilleona
go, but Camilleona not �appy.
Camilleona not get told what do to not be naughty
girl. Camilleona �ave �er bummy spanked when Camilleona not blame!� Camilleona
shouted as she stomped out on her tiptoes giving her long slim legs rigorously
taut muscles that taught a delicious lesson in the art of curvature, as her
handsomely generous portion of titties bounced with
her pronounced flounce. And she waggled her bottom wildly provocatively behind
her, till she slammed the swimming pool room door to emphatically punctuate her
ever-discontent.

&nbsp;

Afterwards, Marina and Seraphima glanced knowingly at each other, and then giggled
in unison, united in love of the Italian thunderstorm.

&nbsp;

For some reason some of Camilleona�s outbursts seemed to happen when both her
mistresses were together. Was the lovely Sicilian jealous of the tangible
gentle love Seraphima and Marina made her also feel?

&nbsp;

But why had Seraphima�s countenance encountered a look when Marina had just now before mentioned Camilleona�s
name?

&nbsp;

Had Seraphima
found that Camilleona�s fire was not confined to her
passionate heart, her supremely intelligent mind, or the lovely legs with which
she kicked and lashed when she was not using her equally pretty arms?

&nbsp;

Had she discovered that Camilleona, without pause, used her doll-sized hands as
paws and her fingernails as claws, and was savagely strong and virulently
vibrantly wild in bed?

&nbsp;

Did she know that, with
incredible stamina and endlessly demanding, Camilleona
was a nymphomaniac�s nymphomaniac in her insatiability? That she made you want
to satisfy her even though you knew you never could, and even though she had
made you cum when you had but thought of her?

&nbsp;

Or was Seraphima
only imaginatively daydreaming?

&nbsp;

�I�ll shower and get ready
for the lake�, Seraphima confirmed as she stepped
over to Marina and kissed her adorable wife.

&nbsp;

�Are you going to wear my
birthday present?� Marina called as the lissom Seraphima lithed to the door.

&nbsp;

�But of course!� Seraphima answered, with a hint of naughty sauciness in her
voice, and love in her sweet smile.

������.

&nbsp;

At sunrise, from the red
rocks five-miles out of Tumbleweed, the Dry Gulch Valley was an ocean of dust: a drifting shifting gritty red fog.

&nbsp;

Squatting to examine the
remains of the rock rubble surrounded fire, still smouldering,
the Nubian negress cowgirl
reached for the cigarillo. It was mostly spent. Raising its cool end to her
pretty nose, she was pleasured by the unmistakeable
smell of girl. Putting its butt to her long tongue, the taste too was
undeniable and erotically rich.

&nbsp;

From the distance was heard
the crack of whips, and the echoing soprano and contralto shouts of the herders
urging the cattle onwards.

&nbsp;

With the cigarillo butt
still in her long pretty fingers, and just taken out from her tongue tip�s
tasting of it, the cowgirl�s sixth and seventh senses told her not to move.

&nbsp;

Without daring to turn, she
whispered loudly: �I ain�t lookin�
for no trouble. I�m just a cowpoke ridin�
side-guard the roundup��

&nbsp;

Risking the very trouble she
was an outrider to patrol against. Chancing that whoever had come up behind her
was not one of the organised rustlers that the ranch
owners had refused to bribe off, the black cowgirl slowly turned. And as she
turned she let out a gradually rising whistle of appreciation.

&nbsp;

A wisp that fluttered out the
back of the Stetson told the cowpoke that this honey, the girl stood behind
with a drop on her, was brunette. But she didn�t get
to look into the sapphire-blue eyes and the astonishingly pretty face, till she
had travelled up two legs, each longer than the
Mississippi-Missouri, and far by far shapelier.

&nbsp;

This girl wore heelless
brown leather cowgirl booties, with wheel-spurs. She therefore stood on
permanent tiptoe, and oh girl did it do great shakes for her legs.

&nbsp;

She was as brown as if she�d gone about naked since the day she was born, but the day she was
born couldn�t have been more than nineteen years back. And despite the
all-over natural olive-brown tan showing her time in the sun, her skin looked
soft as rose petals.

&nbsp;

Apart from the Stetson and
the booties, the honey wore only a Mexican style poncho. It left her lovely
arms free, and god only knew what a beautiful view from either side. Front, and
back, its corners hung triangle to cover some strategic site sights. But, from
where the cowpoke squatted still, with the aid of a lifting breeze she could
see that the brunette, was equally genuinely
brown-downed between her goddam wonderful thighs.

&nbsp;

The dark-down on the honey�s
forearms glistened. From where the cowgirl squatted, she spotted the heavy
weapon on this gorgeous creature�s left thigh. It was still in its holster, the
holster being strapped, top the thigh near her crutch, and also just above her
knee. The butt of its handle faced forward.

&nbsp;

�See you�re packin� a long-barrel�, the Nubian cowpoke muttered
nervously.

&nbsp;

�Reckon so�, came the relaxed answer, soprano with a surprisingly
south-European singsong to the accent.

&nbsp;

The cowgirl re-thought her
introductory remark. Whether this gungirl was a good
guy, or an outlaw, the squatting cowpoke wanted up and out of where she was at.

&nbsp;

�Don�t think I heard your
name�, she tried, desperately.

&nbsp;

�Don�t reckon I told it�, came the cool calm answer.

&nbsp;

The roles now changed, with the
olive-complexioned leggy brunette assuming the questioner�s part: �Just how
many you got rolling down the valley below?�

&nbsp;

�We�ve twelve-hundred head
of brunettes, two-hundred or so of blondes, one-hundred-fifty of redheads, and
some fifty negresses so damned gorgeous like you
could only dream of�.�, the cowpoke replied, proud of her part in the
commonplace duty of herding ponygirls to market.

&nbsp;

�We can always use an extra
gun. We had five prime milkers stolen only yesterday,
even �fore we�d left Tumbleweed�.�, she went on. Won�t
do the rustlers no good though. We got �em branded on their sweet asses with the double-O of the
�Organic-Orgasm Farms Inc� ��

&nbsp;

�Maybe you�ll lose some more
if�n you don�t get yourself back down there�, the
tanned brunette mused, in a husky stage whisper.

&nbsp;

The cowpoke�s eighth and
ninth senses now told her this was her only chance to change the order of
things. She didn�t like squatting in seeming subservience, even to this
astonishingly lovely stranger.

&nbsp;

In a split second she had
risen, ripped her gun out, and was facing the gorgeous brunette; or would have
been save that in an even more split second, a bullwhip had wrapped around her
wrist and wrenched it so hard aside, as to leave her six-shoot in the rocky
dust, before it had nextly wound around her neck to
half choke her.

&nbsp;

�I just knew it.
You�re�you�re the Loner�, the cowpoke croaked, as she was throttled to a faint.

�����.

&nbsp;

�Pronto� had not lost all
her human sympathies. The Loner had always been gentle with her. She only used
the crop when Pronto got frisky. She had never dug in the spurs; at least not
since that time they had chased Sexy Red out of Nub City. Even then it had only been from frustration because
Sexy had gotten away.

&nbsp;

The settling back down of
the dust in Dry Gulch Valley after the cattle drive had passed, had not
entirely covered the unmistakeable prints of the
hooves of Pronto�s fellow ponygirls,
being herded from one town to another to meet market forces, where there was a
meat market to meet, and make replete.

&nbsp;

The Nubian negress Pronto, knew renewed fear.
She knew her place and was thankful for it. The day she had been purchased by
the delicious brunette now riding her, had been the sweetest of her young life.
Why this lovely creature had taken pity on her, Pronto
would never know.

&nbsp;

Tacked out in harness with
mouth bit, she had been obediently walking the circle that drove the pump to
draw up the village�s water, for four years by then.

&nbsp;

The marks on her body had
told of how the village girls treated her. The spiked cactus they had inserted
into her cunt after their night on the raw rye whisky, had been the least of their cruelties.

&nbsp;

They had constantly rubbed
her to the verge of a cum, and then mocked her cruelly
when she had cried with the frustration of not being able to go all the way.
Then, when she had actually cum under the lash of a casual noonday
bullwhipping, they had mocked her again.

&nbsp;

So as to distract the cruel
girls, the Loner had thrown coins in the dirt as she had cut Pronto�s bonds. Pronto could never have counted the money,
but she knew it was far more than she had been originally sold for at market.

&nbsp;

The villagers had actually
bought her as exchange for the worn out bucket they had replaced in their well.

&nbsp;

Pronto had been the last in
the sales� ring, and a giveaway, since her former owners wanted her off their
hands, having already made all the money they needed, and more, from the ponygirls they�d previously sold. They did not want to go
back home with the one remaining pony-whore in tow. They wanted rid, at any
price.

&nbsp;

When the peasant girls had
led Pronto out of town to their home village to work their water well, the old
bucket she had been exchanged for, had been left
behind in the town cattle market, in truth, unwanted.

&nbsp;

After the rescue, the Loner
had ridden her bareback out of the village with the cactus still up her. But,
in gratitude for her rescue, the Nubian negress
wonder, Pronto, had fought girlfully against the pain
of it, and the astonishing arousal it had given her. She had gritted her teeth
on the rope through her mouth in lieu of a bit, and slavered as she fought not
to cum while the cactus� spikes continued to rip her.

&nbsp;

Here and now, as she
recalled her rescue from Tumbleweed, and that cactus in particular, she found
her cunt wetting-up the leather crupper that divided
her love-lips.

&nbsp;

But now she was being forced
back there, back to Tumbleweed where she had been tortured by all the village
girls: ridden, driven by her mistress� relentless pursuit of the notorious
outlaw Sexy Red. 

�����.

&nbsp;

Pronto could not recall
seeing the girl at the Tumbleweed livery stables before. She was superbly sweet
and always smiling love. Her gentle demeanour showed
even in the movements of her delightful little hands. To be rubbed down by this
negress angel was going to
be a delight.

&nbsp;

A silver coin changed hands,
and her mysterious mistress left Pronto to the tender loving care of this
pretty negress, as she, Pronto�s mistress, decided to look around Tumbleweed. 

�����.

&nbsp;

The �jink�
�jink� of the Loner�s spurs as she wiggled off on
tiptop tiptoe along the raised wooden sidewalk of this godforsaken dump�s dump,
�Tumbleweed�, was the last sound Pronto heard, as the smiles of the stablegirl angel glowed, and she stroked her nose, to settle
Pronto, ready for a washing down. 

�����.

&nbsp;

Tumbleweed was a tumbledown
would-be town that did its best. It had only been built because there was a water well in its northern centre, and for no other reason
of any account.

&nbsp;

There were
some decent woman in the town. As the ethnic-Italian olive-bronzed
stranger, tall, willowy-slim, long-legged and very lovely, waved her sexy ass
slowly down the street, they scurried and hurried back into from whence they
had just emerged, or turned a one-eighty to attend to something they had just
made up as a recalled urgent mission.

&nbsp;

Naked beneath her poncho,
the Loner was cool and calm in body and mind. She kept her bullwhip coiled on
her right thigh, and her ramrod in its holster on her left. She was used to
causing this degree of disturbance.

&nbsp;

She was sweet and gentle by
nature, and hated the fear she created. To any woman coming within reach of
her, she reached up her long slim fingers to politely touch the brim of her
Stetson, and whisper a reassuring: �Good mornin�
ma�am�.

&nbsp;

Although seeming relaxed the
Loner�s eyes turned within her lovely head, to survey for positions from which
a gungirl might drop her. The Loner inspected all she
passed, against what she half expected.

&nbsp;

After what she passed became
past, her experience told her all was safe behind. All she therefore had to
worry her still, was to front and either side of her,
as if that were not enough.

&nbsp;

She was looking for any and
every hideout where an outlaw or gang member might be found. She was looking
for Sexy Red, and her cohort of co-whores.

&nbsp;

Sexy Red, so named after her
profusion of flame-red curls that fell in a tumbling titian torrent down below
her lovely ankles, was vicious and a killer though she was but a twenty-nine-year-old
English girl. She had once been a Girl-Court judge. She had made her name from
slaying lawgirls. There were nineteen notches on her
six-gun, and she had every intention to score more, if more of those pesky
tormentors got in her way. There was, therefore, a price on her head.

&nbsp;

Sexy had made a million
dollars from violent bank robberies. There were never any witnesses of these.
Sexy and her gang took care that every woman and girl who might testify against
them was shot dead, after they had been made to load the looted money onto a
stolen buckboard of course.

&nbsp;

Everyone knew Sexy Red was
behind the spate of robberies. Nobody was around who could testify to that in
court though. Nonetheless, Sexy found it the better part of caution, to keep
herself and her companions-in-evil hidden away.

&nbsp;

She didn�t want the
notoriety. She wanted to enjoy her spoils. She had a string of the finest
Italian born bred and trained ponygirls, she would race for huge bets, as many lovely girls as
arm-candy and bed companions, and her coequals in evil, her gang-members, with
whom to get blind drunk on stolen Italian girl-pee, every night if she chose.

&nbsp;

Sexy Red, born as Teasetta Loveschild, had a
background of curious parallels with that of the Loner. They had both been born
to parents who had died leaving them as orphans. Sexy had been brought up in a
mid-west orphanage, where she had gotten into bad company. Too intelligent for
school, she had put her mind to devilment. Her notoriety had begun when she had
been discovered one afternoon in bed, with her school ma�ams�
head in her crutch, with the school-teach eagerly licking her out between her
lovely thighs.

&nbsp;

The Loner had known that
same orphanage for a while, but had been whisked away, first to live with a
maiden aunt; then, when the aunt had died, to a convent school, where she had
been raised and taught by nuns, in an atmosphere foetid
with suppression of the deep sexuality that a girl as stunningly attractive as
the Loner naturally possessed. 

�����.

&nbsp;

In a microsecond�s
microsecond, the Loner had turned with her bullwhip uncoiled.

&nbsp;

The lovely Nubian negress flinched, but somehowed she was in no danger.

&nbsp;

As the Loner recoiled her
whip: �Stranger�, the nubile negress
began, �I�m sheriff of this here town, and what I says, goes. Whether you like it or don�t, ain�t none
of mine. We�s simple
folks here in Tumbleweed. We don�t want no trouble.
You�re welcome in this town long as you surrender up that there six-spin on
your horny thigh, and the blacksnake coiled on t�other.
So let�s have no trouble and a handover: butt first, and no �buts�. Savvy?�

&nbsp;

The Loner ran an
appreciative eye over the shapely black girl with the long trail of pubic hair
forming a tail behind her. She filled her denim miniskirt like it was poured-on
paint. Her stiletto booties half up her calves didn�t hide none that her legs
had acutely cute curves. Her ass said �spank�. Up top, her red-chequered shirt danced about like it held two mischievous
puppies. Her face lit a light that her lowered brown eyes and soft moist lips
tried to hide. Her closed mouth formed all but an �O� for orgasm. She was too
sweet to be trying so hard to be hard. She was made to be kissed; not to take
this risk.

&nbsp;

�Sheriff Seraphima?�, the Loner queried, but more as a conclusive statement
than an enquiry.

&nbsp;

�The same�, the sheriff
answered with a look of astonishment. Say, but how�d�ya
get my handle stranger?�

&nbsp;

As her startling
sapphire-blue eyes fellated the feminine figure of the sheriff, the Loner
tipped the edge of her Stetson in polite salute of a charming lady: �Arizona
Ranger ma�am. I won�t be in your town more than I got to. I�m trail for Sexy
Red. I hear talk she�s been flashing her goddam
gorgeous golden curls hereabouts. And I want speak with her, kinda urgent, if you get my drift. Then I can be on my
ways��

&nbsp;

The sheriff�s answer came
too quickly for it not to be a lie.

&nbsp;

�I haven�t even thought
about Sexy Red�s ravishing rolling ringlets this four-years
and more. You got the right �Tumbleweed� stranger?� she reflexed,
without confirmatory eye contact.

&nbsp;

�Maybe�, the Loner answered,
her intonation of even so brief a phrase confirming an
understanding of the attraction that Sexy Red, with her supremely superb curls
and her heart-stopping heart-shaped moon-white face, and the sweet freckles
dancing over her pretty little nose, could engender.

&nbsp;

�Sheriff Seraphima?�, said the leggy Loner.

&nbsp;

�Sheriff Seraphima?�, said the lovely Nubian negress
Pronto.

&nbsp;

�Sheriff Seraphima?�, said the smiling loving stablegirl.

&nbsp;

�Sheriff Seraphima?�, said Sexy Red�..

&nbsp;

Seraphima awoke to the gentle splash of the lake water: the
water of Lake Charlotte, the biggest lake of the inland archipelago that was Senabre, the southern African jewel in which Seraphima had now lived for four lovely loving years with
her darling of a darling wife, Marina�..

������

&nbsp;

The African sun bowed down
before Seraphima�s glory. Her dark black body was
naked, bar detail such as a summer-blue bikini bra, that
lifted her breasts to a balcony scene in which the twin heroines stood proudly,
side-by-side, and rose and fell with the easy breathing of the gorgeous woman
they were in intimate animated converse with.

&nbsp;

On her lovely princessly head, she wore her birthday present, a totally
impractical, but deliciously delightful woven-straw sombrero, with a
summer-blue ribbon tied in a silly saucy bow around its crown�s base.

&nbsp;

Seraphima had braided her pubic hair into two pigtails, which
she had woven, alike-to-garters, around her vast thighs, and held in place with
summer-blue side-ribbons tied in chocolate-box bows, to match and echo the bow
around her hat, and the blue of her bra.

&nbsp;

Deep within the darkest of
dark curls that still hid Seraphima�s ultimate
mystery though: within her cave closed cave, there were stirrings.

&nbsp;

Seraphima�s eyes, her devil-deep-down-darkest-brown lanterns of
searing love, showed daze from the afternoon day�s heat causing a dream phase,
as she awoke to the peaceful plash of the water, whilst the boat, a punt, a
girl-gondola, bobbed its uplifted prow, snailing
sailing proudly in the midst of the coastal water of the huge salt-lake, Lake
Charlotte, more a sea than a pond: its waves rippling blinding flashes of the
hydrogen fuelled Helios smiling birthday love from above, and warming the
nubile Nubian negress as it blessed her soft smooth
flesh.

&nbsp;

As she realised
she was now having a wide-awake wet-dream, Seraphima
moved a handsome thigh to hide what was happening besides inside, as her long
proboscis clitoris, coiled like a butterfly�s snout in its moist pouch, was
threatening to uncurl, and show how very much she was a girl, by rising up and
out of her to express her aroused joy, as if it were even remotely possible she
could be mistaken for a boy.

&nbsp;

Seraphima�s lovely wife, Marina, sat at the rear of the craft,
controlling the direction it occasioned, by occasionally pulling gently, with
practiced relaxed skill, on the two silk ropes that led to the outboard motor,
as the motor quietly motivated the craft forward, in the gentle breeze that
blew on the blue of Seraphima�s fabulously
filled-full fulfilled bikini top.

&nbsp;

As Seraphima
moved a birthday-girl�s thigh to shyly hide that she was getting a clitoral
erection, she was thankful to see that Marina was, with her eyes ablaze, in a
gaze solely at the horizon of the course she was taking the boat afloat.

&nbsp;

Seraphima closed her eyes to hide herself from the knowing
stare. And then she opened them again, to look at the kitten-cat smile from the
outboard motor.

&nbsp;

Seraphima�s eyes followed the ropes that ran from each of
Marina�s lovely hands, to the rear of where her wife sat her lovely rear, to
steer the girl-gondola, and marvelled at the way
those ropes were tied to the coral-pink nipples of the tits of the maid Camilleona.

&nbsp;

The exquisite Camilleona was mounted motor to motivate emotionally, the
motion of the girl-gondola.

&nbsp;

Camilleona was completely naked, bar the flippers on her feet,
which, along with her long slim fabulously shapely lower legs, were immersed in
the lake�s lapping waters.

&nbsp;

Her upper body was leaned
over the rear of the boat, and reared up proudly as if, in fact, her gorgeous
figure were its figurehead. Her arms were pulled aside, straight aside, and
tied by the wrists to the boat�s inner stern. Her lustrous brunette hair was
wound into a single pigtail, which coiled over her slim delicate shoulders, and
lay in her cleavage, as if it were the cruellest of
gentle whips.

&nbsp;

To steer the boat to port or
starboard, Marina merely pulled the rope tied to the relevant tit, to
order Camilleona to use her right leg more than her
left, or her left leg more than her right. But otherwise, the two ballooning
tits were gently but firmly pulled both together, so as to keep the motor
swimming with her swoon-worthy lower limbs, blessing the water with their shear
beauty as she therewith and thereby pushed the girl-gondola along.

&nbsp;

The unmistakeable
look of arousal in the powerfully passionate Camilleona�s
gorgeous sapphire eyes, was matched by the secretions she was salivating down
the pole, the rowlock, the fifteen-inch-long steel spur on which her cunt was spiked, and by which she was impaled to the rear
of the boat she was forced to give emotional motion to, by the use of her
wonderful legs.

&nbsp;

The ferociously fearsome fury
of the Italian minx, was so placated by the
ministrations her swimming whilst so impaled on the, and in the, very source of
her saucy passions, that she now smiled mistily and mysteriously. And so much
of the joy Camilleona was enjoying, was from her looking
at, and over, and up, and down, and all around, the superb near naked Seraphima. And Seraphima burned
with the embarrassment of knowing that she was this tortured girl�s
masturbatory totem token. But yet her shy blushes only rushed her clitoris to
moist shining erectness. And she could not help but look at Camilleona
to see if Camilleona had seen that she, Camilleona, was giving she, Seraphima,
a very literal, very hard time in the littoral, with her proboscis clitoris
shooting up and forming a rigidly proud mast in the prow of the boat, hard and
throbbing pleasure-painfully, and ultimately gainfully, as her slice slithered
with her horny-honey. And Seraphima saw the Italian
angel blush with the honour of her wonder causing
such an earthly heavenly upshot. And Seraphima looked
love at Camilleona, as she, Seraphima,
within the deep dark tangled wrangled jungle of her profuse profusion and
confusion of pubic curls, bubbled with joy. And Seraphima
quietly crossed her curvaceous legs and squeezed together hard, her gigantic
thighs: thighs wrapped in wreaths formed from her plaited pubic hair: wreaths
awarded for her thighs� winning winsome wonder�..wrapped her wreathed and
pubic-hair-gartered thighs hard together, and sighed as she almost silently
secretly came, secreted a moist spurt that hurt, and came a second time again.

&nbsp;

As Seraphima
avoided Camilleona�s look of love and lust and pride
that she had made her mistress cum inside outside, a long pregnant pause
followed.

&nbsp;

�Are you glad you�ve now
come twice on your birthday, my angel?� the innocent Marina suddenly asked, thus breaking the lapping splashing
silence: smiling, just as Marina
always smiled, referring of course, to the celebratory boat trips this year and
last.

&nbsp;

�It was�. It is just wonderful
my love�, Seraphima answered after a pause:
responding with her head lowered in completely inappropriate and misplaced
disgrace and opprobrium, at what she had just done, in having open-air orgasmic
cums, enjoying Camilleona�s
enduring her still enduring torture.

Seraphima Too

(by
Eve Adorer)

&nbsp;

Chapter 2 � Drool

&nbsp;

Day-to-day routine for Marina, was in the running of the girl-gondola hire business
her family had owned for over thirty years now.

&nbsp;

Pleasure was a major
business in Senabre. Tourists from the Americas and Europe flocked to flop by the inland lakes, enjoying the
mix of sun, and the sin of having the lovely Senabran
women at their beck and call.

&nbsp;

Senabre numbered white, black, and mixed beauties among its
nearly all-girl population.

&nbsp;

The plethora of girls in the
country seemed to be accounted for by nature�s decision that the only way to
bejewel such a heavenly nation, was to bespeckle it with god�s finest of her finest creations.

&nbsp;

However, it was speculated
that, in truth, there was a darker side to this development.

&nbsp;

Within the Senabran tribes, girl babies had always been regarded with
the joy that was never felt to the same degree for a boy; or so it was said. It
was rumoured that infanticide had therefore been
practiced, to weed out boys.

&nbsp;

Nothing was ever proven by
the historians, anthropologists, or archaeologists however. So, the conclusion
ultimately drawn, was that the fact that births of
girls in Senabre, outstripped boys by a factor of
nine in every ten, was a serendipitous wonder.

&nbsp;

Nobody was complaining. Senabran girls, black, white, and mixed, were sensationally
lovely. White, black, and mixed, they were distinctly distinguished by their
incalculably complex rippling usually dark black curls, matched on head by
muff, and on muff by head.

&nbsp;

Perhaps, quite literally,
the highest beauties in the land, were the girls of
the Petian Tribe. These statuesque wonders grew to a
willow-wand six feet and more in height, with a holy proportionate length of
those six feet, being supplied by wholly superb legs.

&nbsp;

As well as their distinctive
distinguishing height, the raven-black haired Nubian complexioned Petian girls also, mostly, had ravishing riveting startling
ruby red eyes.

&nbsp;

No Senabran
politician worth her want of votes, was ever to be
seen without a Petian mistress in tow by her lovely
hand. It was said that the Petian beauties ruled Senabre from the government�s bedrooms.

&nbsp;

The one exception was the Senabran president, herself a Petian,
whose wife was an adorable bubbly smiling Georgettian
tribesgirl, like Seraphima�s
wife, Marina Ntebeli.

&nbsp;

Marina knew her marketing too. From and for being able to
boast that she only employed Petian tribesgirls as the outboard motors on her girl-gondolas,
she had doubled the turnover of her boat-hire business, and bought out many
rivals. 

������

&nbsp;

Seraphima felt some frustration.

&nbsp;

She loved Marina to distraction, but was bored by being Marina�s trophy wife. 

&nbsp;

Of course she adored being
adored, and nor did she mind wearing the close-contour clinging rubber shirts
and skirts that Marina had lately taken a passion for, as fashion had whimmed that way of a sudden.

&nbsp;

To see, indeed for Seraphima herself to see, Seraphima�s
exceptional curves filling out to its ultimate attainment, the condom-close cling
of a rubber bustier, with its separate capacious cups for Seraphima�s
copious breasts, and her bottom rise and fall and swing its thing in the thin
close cling of a rubber micro-skirt, was to witness a living organism, organised as a walking orgasm.

&nbsp;

The colours
too, were dazzling, and chosen to contrast with Seraphima's
incomparable dark chocolate. Her en-pointe booties
were also these days of brightly coloured rubber.
Bare-legged, Seraphima glowed with her horny black
beauty, as she played housewife for the little smiling love on legs that was
Marina, her darling wife. 

������

&nbsp;

Today, the rubber was
parakeet-green, skirt and top. The top, a rubber tee-shirt was being given two
very promising, equally prominent, prominences, by Seraphima�s
profoundly protuberant breasts pushing its material materially out, to precede
her motion as she swayed her delightful way, to arrive at any destination she
chose to go forwards to, at least a seeming two seconds before the rest of her
steaming body.

&nbsp;

Her lower quarters, two
half-moons aglow and ago, filled a close-clinging rubber micro-skirt, that her
natural walking wave seemed to be trying to shake off with the rise and fall of
her two rotund hillocks, with such rock and roll did she decorate even the
merest gentle stroll.

&nbsp;

At her wife�s express
desire, Seraphima never wore panties, and would
either have her pubic hair wrapped as enrapturing garters around her stupendous
thighs, or else, as now, let it trail its six-feet of dark-brown twisting
ringlets, as an erotic tail, dangling down long luscious and luxuriantly, from
the slit between her long luscious and luxuriant legs, to weave and weft its
silent glide behind her, waving wonderfully wandering abaft, as she angelled her way, tiptop tiptoe in her ballectic
shoes, with her torsion-tensioned legs, a caress of curves, and with her
peacock�s tail sliding and snaking side-to-side, as she swayed her way, her
deep-seated, never-sated, clearly stated girlness, unmissably unmistakeably to
portray. 

������

&nbsp;

As Seraphima
entered the kitchen, to inspect Camilleona�s progress
with the luncheon, Camilleona turned, smiled
genuinely sweetly, and curtsied. A wonder of wonderful legs,
that was accompanied by her sexy: ��Ello my
lady�.

&nbsp;

�Good morning Camilleona. You do look pretty today!�, Seraphima
let slip as she looked at the Italian maid, who might have been made for the
black silk maid�s outfit she displayed within, with her tits splayed, and her
long legs made longer seeming my the black seamed stockings her suspenders held
high on her dream legs.

&nbsp;

�Oh! Thank you so my lady!� Camilleona blushed, as she curtsied once more, and once
more flashed the devil-black thong in which the seat of her longing belonged:
her thong filled with the thrilling lips, that so
eloquently spoke of love in their composed closed silence, as she dipped her
curvy legs in her obedient little wowing wooing bow.

&nbsp;

�When you�re ready� Seraphima gently insisted, trying to recover from her
mistake of flattering the ever-high-octane-fuelled Italian wench.

&nbsp;

�When Miss Marina go work,
she call tell Camilleona to be sure tell Miss Seraphima not she forget post mail, Miss Marina leave in
office�, Camilleona pouted as she undid the laces
that criss-crossed her dress� bib, and thus her
bosom.

&nbsp;

Seraphima reached under a table, lifted up a bright shining
stainless-steel bucket, and put it on the tabletop.

&nbsp;

After Camilleona
had undone the last of the laces of her bib, with the dextrous
dainty fingers of her doll-sized hands, she next worked the puff-sleeves of her
maid�s dress off her fragile shoulders.

&nbsp;

�Did Miss Marina not tell
you to post the mail yourself then Camilleona?� Seraphima innocently asked.

&nbsp;

�Oh Miss Seraphima! �Ow you
make Camilleona naughty with your question! Camilleona pass message Camilleona
told pass, and now you make Camilleona seem she need
her bummy spanked for being not behave like good
girl. Camilleona try so �ard
to be good for you and Miss Marina, and �ow not nice
it be that poor Camilleona word told lie when she not
lie ever on her honour and �ope
she die if she be naughty girl�.� Camilleona puffed
and pouted as her hair-trigger passion instantly poured out.

&nbsp;

Camilleona had now stripped to her waist, the top of her maid�s
dress bouncing on her beautiful full bottom, as she stood thus half-undressed,
with her legs stressed into sweet swerves by her pinpoint stance in her black
kid-leather ballet shoes.

&nbsp;

Seraphima passed the Italian firebrand a bright red ribbon,
and watched the lifting and shifting of Camilleona�s
heavy bare chest, as the olive-brown wonder, tied her dark-brown hair so it
could not wander, even as her heavy tits did just that, wonderfully.

&nbsp;

At a gentle nod from Seraphima, Camilleona tottered on
her temptingly torsioned legs over to the table, to
face Seraphima across it, and then leaned forward
over the readied bucket, with her doll�s hands clasped behind her back.

&nbsp;

As she took a firm but
gentle grip of the bases of Camilleona�s dangling
tits, and began to squeeze them in alternating turn, with a steady rhythm: �I apologise�, Seraphima affirmed.

&nbsp;

�I sorry too� Camilleona pouted with a sexy sulk, as Seraphima
worked her tits left and then right, and left and then right, by turn, making
the sweet white milk spurt from Camilleona�s
coral-pink nipples, and trickle down the insides of the bucket where it had
splashed with a mild metallic clash, after each squeeze.

&nbsp;

�Camilleona
really try �ard she be good girl for you and Miss
Marina�, Camilleona muttered on, still alight with
the slight she had felt like a disproportionate sting, as ever, when her
message had been questioned.

&nbsp;

For just a moment or two,
the impassioned Camilleona was semi-silent, and all
that was heard was the bubbling in the bottom of the bucket as it slowly
filled, because the white jets being squeezed from Camilleona�s
tits were now troubling and bubbling the creamy
lactation with which the bucket was slowly filling.

&nbsp;

�I did say I was sorry�, the
usually placid Seraphima found herself saying almost
angrily, as Camilleona muttered on like a pre-storm
thunder rumble.

&nbsp;

The silence between the two
girls fell again, and the air was filled only with the sound of Camilleona being milked, and the jets from her nipples
causing twin spaced splashes in the now half-filled bucket.

&nbsp;

��Ow
my mistress Marina and my mistress Seraphima like Camilleona�s wine, now Camilleona
only eat fresh fruit and much grape?� Camilleona
enquired, as a peace offering, whilst she bent over still, still having her
beautiful tits milked.

&nbsp;

�You know your wine is
impeccable�, Seraphima confirmed, pausing momentarily
from her tugging of Camilleona�s tits, before getting
back to the steady milking of her maid.

&nbsp;

Camilleona visibly blushed with pride.

&nbsp;

�Not only is your wine
wonderful, but I�m sure your milk yield is going up�, Seraphima
ruminated aloud, as she found the fountains from Camilleona�s
tits just beginning to give out.

&nbsp;

Camilleona rose with white droplets turning to trickles running
under her breasts.

&nbsp;

�I think we are going to
have to milk you three times a day from now on�, Seraphima
affirmed, as Camilleona wiped her nipples, and began
to put her dress� top back on.

&nbsp;

�Yes my lady�, Camilleona pertly smouldered, as
her legs shouted for hands to explore them, and her fore lips, and her four
lips, parted for another girl to kiss and adore them, when she curtsied once
more.

&nbsp;

The three-quarter-filled
bucket of creamy milk was for Camilleona to sort. She
would container it and refrigerate it; at least that
she would not use in her other role as chef.

&nbsp;

Finished her chore, Seraphima wiped her hands, and then wiggled out of the
kitchen, waving her parakeet-green rubber-clad bare bum, like a semaphore for
being made a whore, as her snake of cunt-curls swept
the floor aft of her before, and her tits proudly appointed the way she must essay
her inestimable assay.

������

&nbsp;

Perhaps pretty Seraphima had too much time to imagine.

&nbsp;

He ears pricked up every
time she heard her wife utter �Camilleona�.

&nbsp;

Seraphima was suspicious and jealous, even if she had no, if
indeed she had no cause to be.

&nbsp;

As she wiggled in her
clinging rubber tee-shirt and tight-tight rubber micro-dress to the local
mailbox with the letters, holding her pubic tress-tail over her left arm so it
may not drag in the dust, and letting her long strong legs show their completely
compelling curvature: passing schoolgirls wolf-whistled, and Seraphima blew them a kiss, so that they fell into
enraptured golden giggles.

&nbsp;

She then again fell into
reverie as she strolled and her side-dimpled bum dipped and switched.

&nbsp;

When Seraphima
had milked Camilleona earlier, there had been no
trouble. 

&nbsp;

The maid had bared her
handsome chest and bent with her titties dangled over
and into the bucket for the first of her hitherto twice-daily milkings, chattering away inconsequentially.

&nbsp;

As Seraphima
had pressed Camilleona�s swollen tits in her gentle
fists at their bases, then used a pulling down squeezing motion that caused the
Italian angel�s fresh white cream to squirt in strong jets from her coral-pink
nipples, and trickle down the side of the shiny bucket, Camilleona
had merely enquired if her week-long diet of white grapes had suitably subtlety
flavoured her pee.

&nbsp;

Seraphima had milked each tit in alternate turn,
working up a steady rhythm to encourage the girl�s milk to flow, and Camilleona�s milk had shot out in long white jets.

&nbsp;

This regular milking kept Camilleona producing, and Camilleona
would make the finest of aromatic cheeses with her milk and pee, as well as
serving her fresh pee as chilled wine for all her mistress�s evening meals.

&nbsp;

The mention in her gentle
mind of Camilleona and Marina in the same breath as
it were, stirred strange passions in Seraphima.

&nbsp;

The brown-eyed wonder was
strangely visited by �the green-eyed monster�. Jealousy, and endless hours in
which to indulge it, had for some time now fuelled Seraphima�s
thoughts.

&nbsp;

In truth, her wife was too
busy to be indulging an affair with the maid, but to Seraphima�s
thinking, that only said that Marina was indulging in sex when the opportunity did allow,
like when Camilleona gave Marina her bath in the mornings.

&nbsp;

And was there not an
extra-sexy sigh in the succulent voice of Camilleona
when she uttered �Marina�? Did she not accent that word with scented
accentuation in the way she sweetly rolled the centre �R�?

&nbsp;

Seraphima had also become a student of the looks exchanged
between Marina and the maid. And there was the way Marina took Camilleona�s hands to
calm her when Camilleona was, as ever, ablaze�..

�������

&nbsp;

Back home, after posting the
mail Marina had left a message with Camilleona about,
Seraphima sat with her eyes looking at but not
seeing, let alone reading, the latest edition of �Hi� magazine.

&nbsp;

Had Marina deliberately left the mail for Seraphima
to send, because it would get Seraphima out of the
house, so that Marina could slip home and give Camilleona
a quick kiss?

&nbsp;

The idea was ridiculous of
course, but Seraphima still analysed
it over and over, working out, not that it was indeed impossible, but the
innumerable ways in which it might just have happened, and feeling thus more
and more betrayed as she undermined her own mind.

&nbsp;

Camilleona tiptop tiptoed into the room. �Camilleona so sorry. She not disturb.
Camilleona come back to do dusting cobwebs later�,
she purred.

&nbsp;

Thinking quickly, Seraphima concluded that to have Camilleona
in her sights would prevent the affair she feared was in full flow somewhere
�out there�.

&nbsp;

�That wasn�t Miss Marina out
there with you just now?� Seraphima found herself
asking, ridiculously.

&nbsp;

�No my
lady. Miss Marina go boathouse
early as usual�, Camilleona answered, surprised and
curious at the question.

&nbsp;

�Shall Camilleona
come back later Miss Seraphima?� Camilleona
enquired sweetly.

&nbsp;

�No. Carry on�, Seraphima responded, pondering whether or not she had
indeed just heard her wife�s sweet giggles.

&nbsp;

Camilleona curtsied with a full-thighed
bob of her devastating body. �Thank you my lady�, she seductively sang.

&nbsp;

With her long legs crossed
and her six-foot long tail of pubic hair coiled at her tiptoed ballet-shoe shod
feet, as she watched the maid busy around the lounge with her feather duster,
like a fluttering butterfly, Seraphima continued to
pretend to read �Hi�.

&nbsp;

As Camilleona
reached up on her also tiptop tiptoe stood feet, showing off the lovely muscles
in her calves, the skirt of her black maid�s dress rose with a soft rustle on
her black seamed nylons, revealing the full expanse of her stockinged
thighs, the tops of her stockings hugging the firm flesh, the side stretches of
those tops pulled high by her devil-black suspenders, the hot bare tanned skin
above the stockings to where Camilleona�s legs became
smoothly firmly cheeky, and the fullness with which the gusset of her
deep-black thong was shaped out so that you could see the delineation of her
love-lips.

&nbsp;

�Marina must have caressed those very thighs this morning,
when Camilleona was bathing her!� Seraphima
sulked.

&nbsp;

Camilleona bent to tickle with her feather duster under a
coffee table. Seraphima, without seeming to be
watching, watched as the skirt rose and showed the smooth rotundity of Camilleona�s bare bum, an enticement to excitement if ever
there was a moon and a sun. And the way Camilleona�s
hot crack pouched a potent pod in her thong too, was that not a deliberate
invitation also to run for bedroom fun?

&nbsp;

�She does that on purpose
when she knows Marina will see!� Seraphima
fumed.

&nbsp;

Camilleona turned, still bending straight-legged, and her
lovely breasts lolled and belled in the criss-cross
laced-up bib of her dress� top. And Seraphima saw
their splendid heaviness, and the heaven of the deep
valley between the huge mountains, a valley through which the eye passed only
to find shadow, but through which it was possible to imagine that one could see
the brunette curls on the Venus-mound of this exceptional girl.

&nbsp;

�The little whore flashes
her tits at my Marina over the bath every morning just like that. And she
takes Marina�s hand and puts it on a tit, whilst she bathes my
loves lovely face!� Seraphima seared.

&nbsp;

Distracted and busy about
her housework dusting, trying to avoid disturbing her adorable mistress, Seraphima sitting so prettily reading her magazine,
suddenly Camilleona turned, startled to find the
exquisite Seraphima stood right behind her.

&nbsp;

�You�re having an affair!!� Seraphima sensationally screamed in flames of accusation.

&nbsp;

Camilleona looked astonished. Her sapphire eyes studied the
outstanding beauty of Seraphima�s face and the look
of fury upon it, which Camilleona read as pent-up
passion. Camilleona turned over in her mind, her
understanding of what she had just heard her lovely mistress shout at her:
�you�re having an affair�, she heard her conscious mind repeat over and over,
�you�re having an affair�.

&nbsp;

In the microseconds it took
for the accusation to be turned over and turned around in the broken-English of
Camilleona�s loving mind, Camilleona
dropped her feather duster and lifted up her pretty arms with her lovely doll�s
hands�

&nbsp;

�and as she stepped forward
toward Seraphima, and then stopped, because Seraphima did not seem to want to share the embrace Camilleona�s delightfully dark-down feathered forearms were
offering, she cried:.�.. �Oh Miss Seraphima,
Camilleona love to �ave
affair with you!� 

&nbsp;

Then Seraphima
wiggled forward and wrapped the lovely maid in her loving arms and, as she held
her and hugged her with her hands accidentally coincidentally under Camilleona�s risen dress, on Camilleona�s
lovely bared bottom cried: �Oh forgive me my darling girl!�

&nbsp;

And, as she held and hugged Camilleona to beg her forgiveness for accusing her of what
the sweet maid was so clearly innocent, the room�s door opened and two more
lovely eyes stared in with rising horror, micro-moments before Marina�s voice
screamed out: �Seraphima!! How could you!!!� 

�������

&nbsp;

Camilleona rushed from the room, confused, but not so
confounded as not to be terrified that her future in this loving household was
suddenly on the line. Surely she would be spanked and then fired, for letting
herself be fondled by her mistress, and being found doing so.

&nbsp;

As she left, she heard a
golden giggle from the darling little Marina, who had realised
she had not in fact been seeing what she had at first thought.

&nbsp;

�Your
face!� Marina smiled with tears of laughter starting in her startling
eyes, as she looked at the repentant Seraphima, and
just knew all was well with her love after all.

&nbsp;

Marina�s giggles were as much from relief from the realisation that her wife was not being unfaithful in any
degree, as at the look of horror and crisis that Seraphima
momentarily portrayed.

&nbsp;

The two lovely girls, wife
and wife, embraced and kissed, and Marina found a new and increased desire
evident in Seraphima, an increase Marina had hitherto assumed was not possible, such was Seraphima�s normal full-on fire.

&nbsp;

Seraphima was still begging forgiveness for her wild-thinking
that Marina could ever have been unfaithful. She wanted to make
love there and then. She kissed and stroked the warm body of her perfectly
formed wife, knowing Marina�s hot-spots and how to kindle her flame. 

&nbsp;

Marina, of course, knew nothing of the true cause of Seraphima�s present mindset, and assumed Seraphima�s eagerness to please, arose from the black
rosebud�s guilt at being apparently found in flagrante
delicto in Camilleona�s
arms.

������.

&nbsp;

�Ahem�, a sweet sound came
from the room�s doorway.

&nbsp;

Moments later: �Ahem�, came the repeated hint.

&nbsp;

�Oh my god: I forgot�, Marina giggled and smiled, just as Marina always but always smiled.

&nbsp;

The two girls, wife and
wife, so enraptured in love, and so wrapped in physical expression of that
love, broke free, and Seraphima looked up to see that
someone else had entered the room.

&nbsp;

The girl that entered and
entranced was her own royal fanfare. Tall, an apparent apparition, with her
moonlight-white complexion, coral pink lips, ice-green eyes, freckles that
divinely danced over her nose, her hourglass-make-gasp figure, stood on her
long sweetly smoothly muscularly shapely legs, with her hair cascading in an
avalanche of abandoned abundant bouncing dancing completely hopelessly copious
cascade, from the crown of her lovely head to the heels of her en-pointe feet: an angel in a cape of inescapably inestimable
sunlight glancing moonbeam dancing eye entrancing glorious rich flame red
curls.

&nbsp;

Marina smiled as she explained: �Seraphima.
Forgive me my darling, but I had this lovely creature hire my boat as a taxicab
this morning, and we got talking, and we got on so well, that I invited her to
luncheon. I hope you don�t mind sweetheart�.

&nbsp;

�Er�
this is Teasetta. Teasetta Loveschild? Teasetta says she
knows you, my love�.�.

&nbsp;

As the golden wonder dressed
with the gilded tresses held out a ghost white hand to shake in greeting: �Hi Seraphima, so lovely to see you again�, said a husky voice
with an intoned hint of a kitten wrapped in a mink rug in the way it purred. 

�������

&nbsp;

Maturity had added to the
golden glory that was the titian tease Teasetta. Her
eyes showed a hint of lovely laughter lines at their sides, and her high
cheekbones added grace to her older face, in place of the younger girl with the
fullness of cheeks that went with that youth.

&nbsp;

With her golden crown
tumbling torrentially down, Teasetta sat opposite
wife and wife at the luncheon table, as a strangely skittish and nervous Camilleona was standing ready to serve.

&nbsp;

Astutely acutely
intelligent, and with her sensitivity evident as ever, Marina had spotted Camilleona�s
nervousness, and gave the servant her loveliest smile as she reassured: �You�re
doing wonderfully well Camilleona. What a delicious
spread you have given us for our delight. Everything is alright sweetheart�.

&nbsp;

Camilleona instantly touched her left breast in lieu of her
heart, and a smile of relieved joy was accompanied by tears starting in her
passionate eyes.

&nbsp;

�Pour our wine please Camilleona�, Marina smiled, hoping that by giving the maid
something to do, it would stop Camilleona bursting
into some fiery tirade as the punctuation of the ending of whatever cloud-cover
had been making her so skittish just now before.

&nbsp;

Camilleona wiggled willingly over, a twist and twine of divine
legs, as she stepped one foot before the other, in a rump rotating sexy gait.

&nbsp;

When she bent to pour the
chilled white wine, firstly into Teasetta�s glass, so
that the guest might taste and approve it, Teasetta
was wowed by the bow and the full view of the gentle heavy raindrops Camilleona�s tits formed, as gracious gravity embraced
them.

&nbsp;

As she raised her glass and
sniffed practicedly at the fruity aroma Teasetta smiled: �That�s just adorable� she affirmed. She
then took a sip: �Mmm, oh gosh, that is really
delish. Is it your maid�s pee?�

&nbsp;

�How did you guess?� Marina smiled.

&nbsp;

�Corsican or else Sicilian�,
Teasetta contemplated as she took another sip. �My
guess would be Sicilian Italian, rather than Corsican French�, she concluded.

&nbsp;

�That�s amazing! You�re
exactly right! How do you do that?�

&nbsp;

�It�s nothing really� Teasetta blushed, loving the admiration of so pretty a girl
as Marina.

&nbsp;

�My husband John keeps a
wonderful cellar. He�s taught me all I know about the different girl-pee to be
found in the world.�

&nbsp;

�Forgive me, for saying that
your offering here is a little novice. Your maid should be fed more grapes, and grapes from her native Sicily particularly. She has obviously been consuming white
grapes from La Belle France. No harm in that at all of course. The fact it
momentarily threw me, and had me thinking �Corsica�, is my look out. It�s a truly delicious offering, and a compliment to
your splendid table�, Teasetta assured.

&nbsp;

Marina smiled, as ever, and nodded to Camilleona,
who obediently recharged Teasetta�s glass, and then
filled Marina and Seraphima�s too in turn, before
lithely wiggling her superb bottom away from the table, to stand ready to be of
further service.

&nbsp;

In continuing pursuit of her
wife�s forgiveness of the accusation of unfaithfulness, that
Marina did not even know Seraphima
had been accusing her of, Seraphima clung close to Marina whenever she could, and, as a symbol of her love for
her love, had already gently draped the full length of her pubic hair over Marina�s lap under the table.

&nbsp;

�Do help yourself Teasetta please!�, Marina sweetly insisted. �That over there,
is a gorgeous red stilton made from our maid�s own milk, and streaked with her
fresh menstruum. You really should try it. I�m afraid
it�s a little rich for me at this time of day, I have an afternoon�s work yet
to do, but it is a fabulous ending to an evening meal. Do try some� please.�

&nbsp;

�You used to be flatmates�, Marina spoke out again, to break a momentary pause.

&nbsp;

�Oh yes� Teasetta
broke in before Seraphima might admit the wrong thing
was being told as if the truth. �Seraphima and I
shared a house in Spindon over in England, till John and I got married. Then she stayed on to
help us pay the mortgage, didn�t you Seraphima?�

&nbsp;

Seraphima nodded her delight of curls, and swept a sweet stray
aside with long lithe fingers.

&nbsp;

�How poor Seraph ever ended
up as a slave in a coalmine� We lost touch you see�, Teasetta
continued the lie, minimising the detail so as to maximise the chance the lie would not be found out.

&nbsp;

�Sold as a slave and now
married to such a lovely girl. Seraphima you are so so lucky!� Teasetta concluded,
working a diversion into her conversational tactic.

&nbsp;

�I saw Seraphima
from a long distance some four years ago now, when John and I came over to Senabre on our second honeymoon. Not to speak to. I mean Seraphima had gone before I could talk to her, and was too
far away for me to call��, Teasetta
explained.

&nbsp;

�I�ve been so busy since.
Then John said I needed a diversion, and this chance came up to come back to
lovely Lake Charlotte once more. And I jumped at it. And I hoped against hope I�d find Seraph
again, so we could talk about old times. And I heard talk she had married and
that her wife ran a boat business: girl-gondolas for hire. And I looked out Marina during a break in my present temporary and strictly
holiday work. And here I am!� Teasetta practically
sang, as her eyes feasted on Seraphima�s lovely round
�O� and oh so kissable mouth.

&nbsp;

�Teasetta
was telling me that she�s starring in a Hollywood movie Cine Verity are making over here�, Marina smiled at Seraphima, in
order to bring the doting Seraphima into the
conversation.

&nbsp;

�I wouldn�t say �starring�
exactly�, Teasetta blushed.

&nbsp;

�You�re so right, this red
stilton is absolutely� mm mmm!� she praised, as she
waived a pretty hand wriggling its lovely fingers to express ecstasy.

&nbsp;

�You named your part: your
character earlier�, Marina queried, having forgotten the part Teasetta had said she was playing.

&nbsp;

�Oh. It�s a western film.
And I�m, would you believe, the evil outlaw �Sexy Red�?�,
Teasetta all but giggled. �Can�t think why!� she
added as an intended extension to the joke.

&nbsp;

�But your hair is so�..�, Seraphima broke in, and then
broke off, just as suddenly.

&nbsp;

To try and hide that she
wanted to hear the compliment completed, Teasetta
took a sip of wine, and thus hid her disappointment that, despite a quick
appeal with her ice-green eyes, Seraphima had lowered
her own eyes and was not in contact for the vital moment, and would not add the
missing word.

&nbsp;

Having seen the disappointed
look in Teasetta�s eyes, Marina complimented in compensation: �Your hair is really
lovely Teasetta�.

&nbsp;

�Thank you�, Teasetta answered, with another quick look at Seraphima, in search of the Nubian negress� supporting affirmation, but not finding it.

&nbsp;

�I was saying that I did not
mind at all, and that it would do Seraphima the world
of good if she wanted to do it�, Marina broke in, aware she needed to get the
conversation around to a conclusion, so she could get back to her boats.

&nbsp;

�Oh yes�, Teasetta recalled, as if she too had forgotten, and as if
it was not the main purpose of her visit. One of our actresses fell head-over-heels in love with a Petian
Tribesgirl, and who could blame her?! So there is a weansy little part, vital to completion of the movie, and
in urgent need of a negress
actress�. Seraphima would be just so perfect for it�.

&nbsp;

And, after having been
semi-silent so long during the delightful light lunch, with hardly a peck at
food, or a sip of wine, Seraphima�s eyes suddenly
opened wide with pleasured astonishment.

&nbsp;

�Oh may I? Oh please please Marina, please let me, please!� she danced bouncing
on her love-lips on her chair, and then leaning over to hug Marina and shower
her with kisses, as her, Seraphima�s face was
suddenly lit with endless miles of excited smiles.

&nbsp;

Marina smiled her love at Seraphima:
�Of course you may my angel�, she whispered, �Of course you may�.

Seraphima Too

(by
Eve Adorer)

&nbsp;

Chapter 3 � Jewel

&nbsp;

Dolly in her denim, Seraphima looked indelibly incredibly edible.

&nbsp;

The heat of the lights in
the humidity of the day and the confined closeness of the walls of the room,
made even a girl as fit as Seraphima perspire. And so
her dark black complexion shone with a sheen that reflected one lovely leg on
the other and one gentle breast in its twin, and vice versa in all four cases.

&nbsp;

She was playing the part of
a bank clerk. In the movie that was being made, the bank was going to be robbed
by the notorious outlaw, �Sexy Red�. Teasetta was
acting the part of Sexy Red.

&nbsp;

With Seraphima
standing en-pointe tall in ballet-shoe-style cowgirl
booties, one followed the lovely legs up to the ragged-edged blue denim microskirt, and, although the eyes did not want to do ought
but linger and ponder what was hidden in the shadow there, above that to the
waistcoat �vest�, which struggled to contain the abundance of Seraphima�s bosom within its tightly buttoned sleeveless
ragged-edged blue denim confines.

&nbsp;

The evidence that Seraphima wore no panties, was clear as day in the full
display of the full flow of her pubic hair, in twin braided twists, with ends
tied in and on themselves, trailing behind her wonderful, wonderfully waving,
wickedly misbehaving behind.

&nbsp;

On Seraphima�s
forehead was a yellow-tinted eyeshade, western movie bank clerk style.

&nbsp;

As she pretended to count
bank notes, in the umpteenth take of the start of her scene in the film that
was being made, Seraphima tried so hard not to smile
with joy at being something she had longed to be since way back: an actress.

&nbsp;

�Cut!� the director called.

&nbsp;

�Darling we really must not
let a smile cross those lovely lips. Counting money is a serious business!� the
director, an English girl rejoicing in the assumed name �Alene
Arlene� teased, to try and win the performance she wanted from the lovely negress.

&nbsp;

�Let�s see those darling
arms and those delightful fingers as you play with the money sweetheart�. And
take!�, she called for the nineteenth time, so that
the cameras rolled yet again.

&nbsp;

Moments later came: �Cut!
That�s a wrap. Time out now girls! No more than a five. I want us all back in
five for the robbery scene. That one just, but just, has to be but one long
take. Do I make myself clear?�

&nbsp;

�Seraphima,
darling, that was just perfect. Relax a mo now, you�ve got your two big scenes
coming�, Alene reminded.

&nbsp;

As far as the first next
scene went, or was to go, Seraphima had seen nothing
by way of a script. That was because of Alene�s
preferred modus operandi. 

&nbsp;

Alene was famed for bringing �naturalness� to her movies.
She never employed real actresses. She maintained that their training had
drained them of the ability to act. An ordinary girl from the street, who had
probably done no more acting than to be kissed by the leading girl in the
school play, that was where true acting was to be found.

������.

&nbsp;

As they stood alone
together, awaiting the preparation of the next shoot: �You know that I love
you, don�t you Seraphima?� Teasetta
whispered.

&nbsp;

�Please�.!� Seraphima sighed, as she lowered her love lanterns, closing
her devil-dark eyes with a shyness she had not felt since she was a teen.

&nbsp;

She then looked up into the
ice-green depths of Teasetta�s signally signalling orbs, and saw that it was true.

&nbsp;

�I can�t���.�, Seraphima whispered.

&nbsp;

�I�ll make you�, Teasetta quietly assured, and leaned forward to kiss Seraphima, who swiftly sidestepped.

&nbsp;

�If you love me, where have
you been this last four years?� Seraphima sweetly
teased, pleased to be so evidently adored by the flawless angel with the golden
glow.

&nbsp;

�Trying to forget you�, Teasetta gently smiled.

������.

&nbsp;

�Come on now darlings! Back
to the set! Come on, I�ve got a deadline and so therefore do you!� Alene called, breaking the static spell. 

&nbsp;

Filming of the next scene
began. Alene had just given the girls taking part a
quick oral run down of the order of events.

&nbsp;

Squatting to push bundles of
dollar notes into the safe, close its door, and spin its combination-lock, Seraphima showed off a huge expanse of thigh, shining with
the sheen of her sweet perspiration. Two inspiring thighs of wonderful size and
equal strength were formed by her squat, and her heavy breasts emotioned motion to match her own magical movements moments
after the rest of her had already moved on.

&nbsp;

The safe safely locked, Seraphima, as the bank clerk she was playing, was told by
her sixth and seventh senses, not to move.

&nbsp;

Without daring to turn, she
whispered loudly: �I ain�t lookin�
for no trouble. I�m just a bank clerk stowing the cash
from the herders that just passed this here way�..�

&nbsp;

Risking the very trouble she
was seeking to avoid. Chancing that whoever had come up behind her was not
friendly, the black wonder slowly turned. And as she turned she let out a
gradually rising whistle of appreciation.

&nbsp;

The complex curls that
fluttered out the back of the Stetson and down to the very ground told the bank
clerk that this honey, the girl stood behind with a drop on her, was a
drop-dead gorgeous redhead.

&nbsp;

But she didn�t get to look
into the ice-green eyes and the astonishingly pretty face, till she had travelled up two legs, each longer than the
Mississippi-Missouri, and far by far shapelier.

&nbsp;

This girl wore heelless
brown leather cowgirl booties, with wheel-spurs. She therefore stood on
permanent tiptoe, and oh girl did it do great shakes for her legs.

&nbsp;

She was as white as if she�d
never seen the sun since the day she was born, and her translucent complexion
looked softer than even rose petals.

&nbsp;

Apart from the Stetson and
the booties, the honey wore only a Mexican style poncho. It left her lovely
arms free, and god only knew what a beautiful view from either side.

&nbsp;

Front, and back, its corners
hung triangle to cover some strategic site sights. But, from where the bank
clerk, Seraphima, squatted still, she could see that
the titian tease, was equally genuinely auburn between her goddam
wonderful thighs, as evidenced by the brilliance of the burnished-red pubic
curls that tumbled in a coiled jungle-thicket to her knees, and glistened in a
sunbeam as her coiled curls gently whirled and waved when the breathtaking
creature merely breathed.

&nbsp;

The gold-down on the honey�s
forearms glistened. From where the bank clerk squatted, she spotted the heavy
weapon on this gorgeous creature�s left thigh. It was still in its holster, the
holster being strapped, top the thigh near her crutch, and also just above her
knee. The butt of its handle faced forward.

&nbsp;

�See you�re packin� a long-barrel�, the Nubian bank-teller, Seraphima, muttered nervously.

&nbsp;

�Reckon so�, came the relaxed answer, with a decidedly horny husky kitteness to its utterance, and a clearly English accent.

&nbsp;

The bank clerk re-thought
her introductory remark. Whether this gungirl was an
outlaw or a good guy, the squatting teller wanted up and out of where she was
at.

&nbsp;

�Don�t think I heard your
name�, she tried, desperately.

&nbsp;

�Don�t reckon I told it�, came the cool calm answer.

&nbsp;

The roles now changed, with
the ghost-white leggy redhead assuming the questioner�s part: �Just how many
was in the heard they just drove outta town?�

&nbsp;

�Some twelve-hundred head of
brunettes, two-hundred or so of blondes, one-hundred-fifty of redheads, and
some fifty negresses�.�, the teller replied, proud of
her part in making safe the money of the cowgirls riding ponygirl
drive, till they came back to Tumbleweed to spend it on cheap girl-pee, and
even cheaper girls.

&nbsp;

�Maybe they could use an
extra gun. if�n you ride out
after them and leave this here fine institution in my safekeeping�, the
spectral redhead mused, in a husky stage whisper. �Afore you go though, mind
you leave me the combo for that there steel-slam of course��

&nbsp;

The teller�s eighth and
ninth senses now told her this was her only chance to change the order of
things. She didn�t like squatting in seeming subservience, even to this
astonishingly lovely stranger.

&nbsp;

In a split second she had
risen, ripped her gun out, and was facing the gorgeous redhead; or would have
been save that in an even more split second, a bullwhip had wrapped around her
wrist and wrenched it so hard aside as to leave her six-shoot somersaulting
over and over on the floor, before the whip had nextly
wound around her neck to half choke her.

&nbsp;

�I just knew it.
You�re�you�re Sexy Red�, the teller croaked, as she was throttled to a
pretended faint.

&nbsp;

�Cut!� Alene
called. �Cut!� Girls that was just terrific? Now give me some of that in the
next scene. You�ve got it read-up Teasetta my golden
angel. Now lets go before we lose the momentum here!
Roll it�.! I said Roll it�.!!�

&nbsp;

To the next scene, Seraphima was a complete stranger. She had been given no
notes on this one at all.

&nbsp;

She began supine on the
bank�s floor, coming slowly around from her well-acted faint.

&nbsp;

�You gonna
tell us the combo honey, or do we gotta get it the
hard way?� Teasetta, as �Sexy Red�, hissed.

&nbsp;

�I don�t know the
combination!� Seraphima answered entirely truthfully.

&nbsp;

Sexy Red nodded, and her
pretty companions clawed and pawed at Seraphima's
skimpy clothing, till the sound of a skirt being ripped and the snap and flying
of buttons, told the truth, that she was being brutally stripped.

&nbsp;

It was not in the intended
outline script, that the shear beauty of Seraphima's
twenty-five-year-old�s fit and supremely feminine
body would cause the bandits to feel the awe they now showed, as the scene
slowed, but�.

&nbsp;

��..Then: �String her up!�
Sexy Red called.

&nbsp;

Moments later, Seraphima found herself with her toes struggling to reach
the floor, as she hung from a roof beam by her wrists, with only her pubic hair
touching, and thus making profound the ground, Seraphima
longed to reach to relieve the stress in her arms and shoulders.

&nbsp;

Teasetta moved her lovely golden curl-surrounded and crowned
face up toward Seraphima�s lowered head, as if she
were about to kiss the Nubian angel, and whispered, �Tell me that you love me�.

&nbsp;

Seraphima instantly shouted aloud: �No!� as if it were written in the unwritten script.

&nbsp;

�Then if you won�t give us
the combination freely, I guess we is gonna have ta whip it outta your lovely
black hide�, Sexy Red hissed menacingly.

&nbsp;

�Oh please god no!� Seraphima genuinely begged.

&nbsp;

The sad whistle of the
lonely bullwhip, as it begged the air to forgive it for the pain it was about
to inflict, as it flicked up, and picked up inexorable speed; saw Seraphima�s long inspirationally sexy black legs, mirrored
with perspiration, dancing helplessly in the clear air, as she fought to avoid
the cruel embrace of the twelve-feet of supple plaited leather, that suddenly
savagely curled right around her naked waist three times, blazing a path in her
flesh of unbelievable fire, concluding with the �rattlesnake� tip of its
heavily knotted end, giving her right buttock a vicious kiss, that caused the
angel to holler horrifically loudly with the terrible pain.

&nbsp;

�Oh god! Oh god! No! No more!! Please no more!!� Seraphima pleaded.

&nbsp;

But the wicked wild whistle
whimpered and wailed banshee�s tale again, as the blacksnake�s tail wound its
path through the winnowing air, air keening with the whine. And Seraphima was embraced thrice in a single trice again, of
spiteful bite that tore its path in her soft complexion, and punctuated its
crescendo with the slap of its impact, and the whack of the coda impacted in
fact by the knotted tail-tip biting Seraphima�s
beautiful buttock cheek again. And her blood flowed in a red trickle from the
vicious welt the kiss of the whip just felt, smelted into her smouldering bottom: a trickling tear of crimson that soon
anointed the wonder of her powerful thigh.

&nbsp;

�No!! No!! No!! No!! No!!
No!!!� Seraphima screamed. This was no pretence. She
had not agreed to this! No girl should be whipped like this!

&nbsp;

�Tell us the combo you
little whore, or you can kiss your gorgeous black skin goodbye!� Sexy Red spat.

&nbsp;

�I can�t!� Seraphima called. �Stop this! Oh please god stop this�, she
shouted and screamed, her voice trailing off to a hoarse croak.

&nbsp;

Two more withering wickedly
wild whistles, signifying significantly violent visitation from blazing
leather, coiled around the Nubian negress,
and kissed her naked tits by turn, as she screamed and screeched.

&nbsp;

And so turned was Seraphima now, two ways, as she helplessly spun from the
impact, and as she was turned to a new tune. And her cries were now sighs and
her �No!!� meant �More!!!�. And Seraphima
cried tears of blood from her crisscross-split left nipple. And she rubbed and
squeezed her sweaty thighs together, to try and finish her arousal with a cum. But her silk smooth flesh slid on the sheen with
which it shone, and was so slickly lubricated that she could not attain the
grip to squeeze her salaciously salivating slit, because her thunderous thighs
slid off each other leaving her crying out with fearsome frustration.

&nbsp;

And yet twice more beyond
these, the wistful whistle of the lonely whip cried and sighed through the sad
air, and cracked on Seraphima�s sweat-streaming sexually
steaming body, thrashing her sweet tits down hard on her chest, as it coiled
around her breast, pitiless python with bitter bite that tore her sweet skin.
And after each lash, Seraphima�s brutalised
breasts leaped from her chest, and flung themselves
out and up in rebound, as if betrayed lovers being deserted by their cruel
amore, and as if begging her cruelty for more.

&nbsp;

And Seraphima
was burned to sin and complete abandon to her unsurpassably
fundamental feminine full-score full-flight no-fight passionate sexuality. And
the whip wailed and told its tale that its tail just wanted to make love to the
beautiful black rosebud. And its cry as it whistled with fearsome ferociousness
through the air once more, sounded so lonely, and yet so totally brutally
brisk, as it wound around the helpless dangling girl with a thrice twirl, to
precisely embrace her in a ring: three rings: a tightening spiral of burning
fire, as it bit every millimetre of the soft
completely smooth complexion in its inexorable path, with its loudest yet
�crack�. And it took her: it took Seraphima between
her massive sweaty shining black thighs. It raped her. The knotted rattlesnake
tip of the bullwhip, after ripping her petals wide apart in an instant�s
instant of non-existent resistance, bit her inside with its lightening-rod
kiss: a kiss as if the whip tip had, in every millimetre,
one-million Piranhas armed with red-hot teeth, tearing a burning path in her
supremely sensitive pink with terrible pain. It struck into her so deeply deep,
the supreme majesty of its absolute savagery searing her sweet innocence.

&nbsp;

And momentarily Seraphima was stung stunned. Her body went as stiff as if
she had been ripped by lightening. And then, after the instant anaesthesia from a blow so dreadful that her nerve-endings
were numbed: anaesthesia from the agony yet to come:
a dam burst: and Seraphima screamed, and gasped and
hollered, time and time again, from the savage ravage and rape of her pink, and
danced devil dervish�s tango tarantella in her unbearable pain, twisting and
twining and cycling her beautiful sweat-sheened legs
to endure enjoying the unrelenting unrelieveable
unbelievable pain of the whip rape, blind to all bar the screaming red screen
that went with her screeches, a screen showing the golden wonder of the
exceptionally exquisite Teasetta�s lovely loving
face, as Seraphima came with a massive cum, and then,
instantly, a yet more monumental cum from her massive cum.

&nbsp;

Seraphima�s eyes were wild with her wanton�s abandonment to
sexual fire from the flames of the kisses of the whip still burning her
burnished body. Her sweat mingled with the tears of blood from the stripes that
surrounded her lovely breasts and beautiful buttocks, and dripped from between
the petals of her raped pod.

&nbsp;

Seraphima had just known a cum from
inside-out to outside-in. She had not only just cum: she had just been so
wholly part of that cum, that she had been her cum. Her whole body, her whole
mind, her whole holy soul had been a cum: a
monumentally mountainously massive cum.

&nbsp;

And Teasetta
moved in close and whisper-begged: �Tell me you love me. Please tell me you
love me!�

&nbsp;

And in agony still, and so
dazed by the extreme sexual experience she had just endured, even yet Seraphima found her love for Marina still paramount, and whispered an exhausted exalted
hoarse: �No�.

&nbsp;

�And�.cut!� Alene Arlene called.

&nbsp;

�Girls! Girls! That was just so terrific! I just adored the
bits where you were demanding that the little floozy say that she loved you, Teasetta. That was a brilliant touch. Don�t know where that
one came from darling, but lets have more of its like
in the scenes to come: Okay!�

&nbsp;

�Take a break everyone!�

&nbsp;

�Seraphima
love: you were just terrific.�

&nbsp;

�Your part�s over now
sweetheart. They find you dead in the next scene: flogged to death in fact. We
use a dummy for that of course. We just need a digital photo of your stripes,
so makeup can get the mock wounds on the dummy to match. Then we can let you go
darling. You know where the pay office is don�t you?� Alene dismissed with a distracted acted sincerity of tone.

&nbsp;

And then, she left the
bleeding wounded bruised agonised and humiliated Seraphima to be photographed, taken down from where she
still hung, and to make her own way home.

&nbsp;

As Seraphima
still dangled by her wrists, trickling with blood, she watched the pretty Alene desert her, running after the scene setters,
shouting, ordering: �No! I want the gallows over on the hill there!���. 

������

&nbsp;

As Seraphima
sat her agonised bleeding body to try and put her ballet-shoes
on, in order to be able to wiggle home, tears of confusion welled and then
poured from her loving eyes.

&nbsp;

Seraphima did love Teasetta. And
yet, even when the brutal whipping had made her surrender to the molten core of
her deepest nature, and she had actually become her cum, she had denied Teasetta the words the golden curled angel longed to hear,
as much as Seraphima had longed to say them.

&nbsp;

But or and, or and or but, Seraphima loved Marina too.

&nbsp;

It was surely a case of, �no
or I go�. Marina would never ever be other than monogamous. Seraphima�s jealousy over the imagined unfaithfulness of
her wife with their maid was now dispelled. Seraphima
knew she had to be as true to Marina as Marina to her, or two hearts would
be broken beyond their ever mending.

&nbsp;

And yet Teasetta
had just shown her love.

&nbsp;

The whipping had clearly
been intended to be intense pretence. Teasetta�s
skill with the bullwhip had shown in the earlier scene where she had ripped Seraphima�s six-gun out of her hand, and then wound the
whip around her neck.

&nbsp;

There were no marks to show
for those strokes. Yet Teasetta had been as good as
her word when she had vowed that she would make Seraphima
love her. The opportunity for Teasetta to make love
to Seraphima with the whip for real,
had clearly been what the girl with the tumbling tease of titian twirls had had
in mind when she had so sworn.

&nbsp;

Oh god was ever a girl so
cursed that she was chased and must be chaste so? Why was the world so cruel as
to deny Seraphima the heaven of Teasetta�s
arms unless she were to abandon Marina�s charms?

&nbsp;

Seraphima initially concluded that she had deserved the
whipping. If she had so enticed Teasetta through the
thoroughly exciting inviting spices of her face and body, and thus been
unfaithful to Marina, her wife of four loving years, Seraphima
had thoroughly deserved to be flogged as she just had been.

&nbsp;

And then she finally allowed
that even as her love had been tested by the fires that the whipping had
released; even when her deepest animal sexuality had been unleashed and arrived
unfettered in full, under the unbearable pain of the flogging, she had still
been faithful to Marina.

������

&nbsp;

Seraphima winced and cried out with pain again as she rose.
The blood from the wounds the black rosebud bore, had stuck her to her seat as
it congealed, and she cried anew with the stab, as her rising reminded her of
the multiple stripes of livid living agony with which she was still burning.

&nbsp;

Seraphima could not bear the thought, let alone the reality,
of donning the close-clinging saffron rubber tee-shirt and rubber mini-skirt in
which she had arrived for the filming.

&nbsp;

And so, though it was, as
she did not realise in her depth of pain, a theft,
she donned a soft white towelling robe, and rose on
her softly smoothly muscular legs, and strode proudly out of the caravan in
which she had changed, along to the pay office to collect her pittance, and
then home, along the bank of Lake Charlotte, with the blood from her savage
flogging trickling over the curves of her god-given calves, as she trailed a
blaze, with her devil�s tails of plaited pubic hair sliding sidling lizard in
the sand between her tiptop tiptoed feet. 

������

&nbsp;

As Seraphima
at last wiggled in through the patio doors of their lakeside home, Marina gasped aghast: �Oh my god! What have they done to
you my angel?�

&nbsp;

�Please take me to bed�, Seraphima begged.

&nbsp;

�Of
course, my love. Of course!�, Marina
lovingly concerned as she rushed to Seraphima.

&nbsp;

But the �take me to bed�
that Seraphima had said, was not the �take me to bed�
that Marina had read. And for the hours that followed, two girls
knew the heights to which the highest of high loves could reach; and universes
beyond; as Seraphima showed the lesson that her cruel
flogging had taught her, and Marina was shocked to find that she longed to kiss
and lick the blood that spilt from Seraphima�s split
nipple, and tongue along her salty welts, and both girls came, and came, and
again came again, as Seraphima played slave to her
mistress and wife for life, as her wife licked her wounds, and two angels from
heaven on earth, paid high homage to lesbian love�s full worth. 

������

&nbsp;

It was a month later that:
�Good morning my lady� Camilleona curtsied as she purred
and pouted: a lesson in lovely lissom limbs.

&nbsp;

�Good morning Camilleona� Seraphima smiled, as
she swung her legs to the side of the bed, and felt for her twelve-inch-heeled
mule slippers with her pretty feet.

&nbsp;

�Shall Camilleona
give my lady a bath?� Camilleona enquired sweetly.

&nbsp;

�No thank you Camilleona�, Seraphima yawned,
stretching and thus letting her breasts open the nightgown she was wearing: �I
think I�ll take a shower�.

&nbsp;

�As my lady wishes�, Camilleona curtsied prettily again.

&nbsp;

�Has �Miss Marina� already
gone to work?� Seraphima enquired, unnecessarily in
truth, using the nomenclature Camilleona habitually
applied when referring to Seraphima�s lovely wife,
and meaning by asking, to prompt Camilleona to
regurgitate any messages she might otherwise have forgotten.

&nbsp;

�Yes my lady. Before go,
Miss Marina tell Camilleona to tell Miss Seraphima, that lady Teasetta
come to call, and that she sorry too busy, so Miss Seraphima
see lovely red-haired lady alone�, Camilleona smiled,
pleased that she had recalled the message and managed to serve it up, in her
supremely sexy English.

&nbsp;

�What time?� Seraphima asked, betraying seeming anxiety.

&nbsp;

�It just make eight o� clock
Miss Seraphima�, Camilleona
answered with singsong brightness.

&nbsp;

�No. No� I mean what time
will Teasetta be calling in?�,
Seraphima asked, a little crossly.

&nbsp;

�Oh!!� Camilleona
suddenly stamped an extremely pretty foot: �Camilleona
make bath and wash Miss Marina. Camilleona do �er breakfast. She milk Camilleona
and Camilleona give plenty milk. Camilleona �ave
bedroom to clean and tidy, and clean shower after Miss Seraphima
use. Camilleona �ave
lunch to make even if Miss Marina say she not be �ome
all day. And then Camilleona do dinner and Camilleona �ave to run around
making cheese and yoghurt for lovely mistresses. And milk Camilleona
�ave to �ave squeezed from
�er titties two times more.
And still they never pleased with Camilleona, no
matter �ow �ard she try! Oh why you so annoyed at Camilleona
when Camilleona try so �ard
to be good girl and not get naughty bummy spanked?� Camilleona pouted as she conducted orchestra with her
lovely arms, shrugged her shoulders a thousand-fold times, and danced her twin
singularly shapely legs in her ballet-shoes, to emphasise
her sudden fury during this mini-tirade.

&nbsp;

Seraphima held up a sweet hand. �We all love you Camilleona, and you are doing a wonderful job�, she assured
the Italian volcano: �I�m sorry if I was unkind�.

&nbsp;

�Camilleona
sorry too, Miss Seraphima�, Camilleona
blushed, as she flushed with pride at the praise of her workgirlship.

&nbsp;

�Please would you bath me
after all Camilleona?� Seraphima
skilfully coaxed.

&nbsp;

�Of course my lady�, Camilleona bobbed a curtsy again.

������

&nbsp;

Once Camilleona
had settled the silver coffee service and delicate bone-china on the
marble-topped table between, but to the side of the four lovely legs, two white
and two black, of the white and black wonders that decorated either side of it,
Seraphima smiled at Camilleona
and said sweetly: Thank you Camilleona. We�ll pour
our own. I know how busy you are�.�

&nbsp;

Breaking off only
momentarily from her awed stare at the shear majesty of Teasetta�s
glistening glistering flame-gold hair, Camilleona
curtsied.

&nbsp;

Then, both the gorgeous
redhead, and the no less stunning negress,
appreciatively watched the progress of the egress of the lovely Italian, as she
wiggled her wonder from the room.

&nbsp;

Now alone, they turned and
smiled nervously at each other, and the universe momentarily knew transfer of
some of its stellar brilliance.

&nbsp;

�I didn�t tell Marina; I mean who did it exactly. Whipped me I mean. I�ve
never let her know fully about my past either. I�m not proud of it. I mean, not
just my past, but my not telling Marina who beat me�..�,
Seraphima said quietly.

&nbsp;

Teasetta did not answer, but watched the pretty hands and
arms of the stunning negress,
as she poured the coffee: black for Teasetta, and
white for Seraphima of course.

&nbsp;

�I meant and still mean
every word I said�, Teasetta answered.

&nbsp;

�I know you did; and don�t
doubt that you do: and I am so flattered and honoured
Teasetta, like you wouldn�t believe�, Seraphima sincered.

&nbsp;

�Do you forgive me for
raping you with the whip?�, Teasetta
asked with evident anxiety.

&nbsp;

Seraphima smiled gently. �You know I do�, she answered.

&nbsp;

There was then a pause, with
neither girl wanting to spoil the sweetly scented silence of their adorable
dual presence.

&nbsp;

�Will Marina be back today, I�d love to see her again. You are an incredibly lucky girl to have such a
darling for your wife, and she works so hard�.� Teasetta
broke in, as her eyes ran up and down Seraphima�s
bold beautiful bare thighs.

&nbsp;

�Have I timed it right?� she
then added, out of joint with timing, judging by her tone.

&nbsp;

�Marina won�t be back today, she�s signing a contract for
some new girl-gondolas. The contractor is bound to take her to luncheon
somewhere to celebrate and seal the deal�� Seraphima
responded with her sweet negress
lips describing the indescribable eroticness of their
need to be kissed, and her eyes blazons of both purity and fire, searing into Teasetta�s soul.

&nbsp;

�I just adore your love-hair
tied in two pigtails like that�, Teasetta
complimented, as she admired the two tightly woven plaits that draped floor at Seraphima�s slender ankles.

&nbsp;

�And rubber suits you so.
You have such a stunning figure, and the bright colours
it lends itself to, are such a delight in contrast with your complexion�, Teasetta went on.

&nbsp;

�You are very kind, and
coming from such a lovely girl as you�.�, Seraphima
lowered her head in a blush, as she saved herself from giving the compliment a
married woman is not aloud to say aloud, unless it be to her wife.

&nbsp;

An outsider would have
assumed that both girls were skirting their meaning, and that outsider would
have been right.

&nbsp;

�Have I timed it right?� Teasetta repeated, having seemingly to insist on the
question that was not being answered in precise terms.

&nbsp;

�Yes. It came on yesterday�,
Seraphima answered, whilst brushing a dark curl from
her heavenly face.

&nbsp;

�Is it heavy?� Teasetta continued.

&nbsp;

Seraphima did not answer.

&nbsp;

�They say it�s the fountain
of youth. I know I�m still pretty, but a girl wants to stay young. There�s
nothing Transylvanian about it you know. It�s just a transfer of �the fountain�
from another pretty girl. �Hi� magazine did a feature on it a year back. Seems
all the celebs are at it�, Teasetta
stated, sounding as if she were excusing herself.

&nbsp;

�I got the message you left
with Camilleona. You know I�m happy to oblige, just
as I did when I was your maid, way back when��, Seraphima answered, sweetly.

&nbsp;

�You do promise you won�t
kiss me�, Seraphima suddenly blurted: �I�d just go
meltdown if you kissed me Teasetta. You must promise.
I�m doing this as a favour for a friend. I�m a
married girl now: a happily married girl�.�

&nbsp;

Teasetta sensed the tension in Seraphima�s
statement and she knew both why and why.

&nbsp;

�Kissing is strictly out of
bounds!� she tried to joke: �No. I mean I love you so much I will do, or
forbear from doing, whatever you ask me, my angel�, Teasetta
concluded.

&nbsp;

�It�s just that I�m so far
from home, and my maid I sent off to see her girlfriend whilst I was over here.
And I need�..� Teasetta�s unnecessary explanation
tailed off.

&nbsp;

�I thought a towel�. Perhaps on the chaise longue. An
hour� I mean, there�s really no hurry, save luncheon at noon, and I must milk Camilleona
just after, or the poor girl will be in dreadful pain�?� Seraphima
murmured nervously.

&nbsp;

�We won�t be disturbed. Camilleona is well trained. She�ll only come if I ring for
her�, Seraphima gabbled in her high tension.

&nbsp;

In answer, Teasetta rose from her chair, letting the inestimable
treasure of her golden curls tumble silently around her ankles as she did so,
smiling nervously at Seraphima, before she took her
beautiful legs, and her beautiful legs took her, to the chaise, on which she
arranged herself with her golden coils under her and away from her moon-white
moonlight face, her coral-pink lips, and her ice-green eyes.

&nbsp;

Seraphima now rose, prettier than any posey, and waltzed wonderful
sway over Teasetta�s way. She then hitched up her
rubber miniskirt, and reached up, unhooked, and slowly removed what she now
placed face upwards, on a nearby table, before lowering her lovely body, to sit
its transparent beauty squarely on Teasetta�s
beautiful face.

&nbsp;

As she sat on Teasetta�s face, Seraphima toyed
with the curls of her hair, playing her adorable long fingers in it, in order
to attempt the unintended and anyway impossible goal, of straightening just one
of her curls out.

&nbsp;

She sat distracted and
daydreaming, her calves curved magically erotically, her gorgeous closed mouth
posed in the �O� of orgasm, as her monthly bleed drip-dropped to form salty
sips for and into Teasetta�s eager mouth.

&nbsp;

As Seraphima
sat, she had parted her thighs to open her petals. Beneath her humid warmth and
supremely feminine aroma, a dream-girl�s tongue, longing to lick, but obedient
to the promise not to kiss, curled into an eager channel to catch and sip draculianly, the beauty and eternal-youth assuring bright
red drips of the monthly bleed from the dark black rose.

Seraphima Too

(by Eve Adorer)

&nbsp;

Chapter 4 � Rule

&nbsp;

With the filmmaking over, and Teasetta having flown home to
England and her busy life as wife for John, professor of law at Camford
University, and as a Girl-Court judge, Seraphima knew she had to relax into the
sole role of loving wife for Marina.

&nbsp;

For her part, Marina had sensed the danger. She had heard
how passionately Teasetta had courted Seraphima with the bullwhip. But she knew
that Seraphima�s resulting orgasms were no betrayal: only the inevitable
physical reaction of such an all-girl girl. It had been rape, not mutuality.

&nbsp;

That Seraphima had not run
off into the sunset with Teasetta, pleased Marina of course. But the smile of
love that Marina was, knew that Seraphima felt regret at her loss, and that her
lovely wife needed more occupation than merely decorating their home�s swimming
pool all day long. 

������.

&nbsp;

�Let me pay for the dressing
gown then.�

&nbsp;

��Fraid it�s not that easy madam.
Theft is theft yer know. Do these �ere rubber close belong to yer missus?�

������.

&nbsp;

Seraphima sat in the luxury
of the business-class compartment of the bullet-train speeding her to the
meeting Marina had entrusted her to attend.

&nbsp;

It was good to be working.
The only work she had done since she had married Marina had been the movie. Her
previous �employment� had been as Marina�s slave, some four years back now. It
was also good therefore, to be working on something she wanted to do, rather
than slaving, or being abused and exploited as the film company had done with
her.

&nbsp;

A glance across from where
Seraphima sat on the train, showed four girls sat either side a table: four
lovely white girls. The prettiest was a petite sweetie with a gorgeous sparkling-eyed
smile. Her straight blonde hair was cropped short and stood stook straight
upright, rippling as she moved, as if wind-blown corn.

&nbsp;

Seraphima exchanged one
look, and thereafter the girl seemed smitten. She talked sweetly, but a little
too animatedly, and pretended not to be looking to see if Seraphima was still
looking at her, though in fact she was obviously using her peripheral vision.

&nbsp;

Seraphima smiled at the
little honey�s loveliness, and the girl�s grey eyes sparkling, and her lips
that shone moist with softness.

&nbsp;

A station stop. A three-girl
departure. A still vacant seat next to Seraphima, and a sweet voice saying:
�May I take this seat?�, the voice of a grey-eyed blonde of no more than
twenty-one, who had had a seat of her own not moments ago.

&nbsp;

As she bent forward to ask
about the seat she already knew was free for her to take, her vee-neck revealed
what pretty little breasts she had: no more than mere undulations. She would
never ever have needed a brassiere, save for show.

&nbsp;

And spotting that Seraphima
could not help but look down her sweater, and was adoring her hermaphroditic
contradictoriness: her boyish near flatness and her very girlish waist and
rear, she leaned a little more forward, and lingered longer, unnecessarily.

&nbsp;

Was she five-three? Her legs
were not long, but, as she stood en-pointe in her ballet-shoes, lovely in their
careering caressable contours.

&nbsp;

As the sweet creature sat
next her, and her skirt rose to show well-rounded black stocking-blessed
thighs, Seraphima could not help but take her eyes on a tour of exploration.

&nbsp;

�Hi�, the girl with eyes
that glowed with her adorableness, whispered.

&nbsp;

�Are you on a business trip?
I saw your suitcase and briefcase, and I said to myself �business-girl!�. I am
right aren�t I?� she asked, with a jokey tone that said �I do so hope you�ll
talk to me, I think you�re so lovely�.

&nbsp;

�I�m off up to Enabe. It�s
more a conference than a meeting. A couple of days of workshops and syndicates,
with the lectures in the same hotel as the attendees are all staying in: then
back to Ntobi�, Seraphima found herself answering.

&nbsp;

�Not �Business Efficiency
and the Menstrual Cycle�?�, the girl asked, with joy in her tone.

&nbsp;

�Why, yes as it happens�.�
Seraphima answered.

&nbsp;

�Kate�. Kate Godsgift?�, the
girl now smiled, as she put out the prettiest of pretty hands for Seraphima to
shake.

&nbsp;

�Nice to meet you Kate. Are
you at the same conference?�, Seraphima enquired.

&nbsp;

�I hope so�, Kate answered
with a mischievous giggle, �I�m the tutor!� She then laughed with her eyes
sparkling love-lightening: and the world grew suddenly sunnier.

������.

&nbsp;

�Let me pay for the dressing
gown then.�

&nbsp;

��Fraid it�s not that easy
madam. Theft is theft yer know. Do these �ere rubber close belong to yer
missus?�

&nbsp;

�Yes, they�re Seraphima�s�

������.

&nbsp;

Later that morning after she
had settled into the hotel and had a quick refreshing shower, Seraphima sat
among strangers, her fellow attendees, as�

&nbsp;

�We should not overindulge in
generalisations�.�.

&nbsp;

Kate kissed the air with her
ever-moist lips and ready shy smile as she fronted the lecture room, a hotel
lounge, pacing on her pretty legs as she added orally to the computer slide
display for her first lecture that first day.

&nbsp;

Seraphima watched her legs
and admired the soft red leather ballet-shoes in which Kate now paraded
pointy-toed pirouette tiptop tiptoed.

&nbsp;

�We should not overindulge
in generalisations, but numerous surveys have shown the assets we girls share, include
the advantage over the male of the species, of our greater communication
skills�.�.

&nbsp;

Kate now wore a light-blue
latex miniskirt that clung to her divine derriere with ne�er a line to define
that she was, under it, anything but perfectly naked.

&nbsp;

Atop a bare belly belying a
belly-dancer as a chancer for claiming to have a midriff to whistle wolf for,
she wore the same shade of blue, in a latex tank-top her tiny titties hardly
troubled to bulge out, but which showed she had pert alert nipples.

&nbsp;

����.monthly fall-off in
productive capacity, not in fact proven�.�

&nbsp;

Kate continued, the rubber
suspenders holding up her condom-fine, close-clinging latex stockings,
straining as her firm petite buttocks rose and fell when she paced the lecture
room.

&nbsp;

���coincidence of the female
cycle in structured environments a positive�.�.

&nbsp;

Kate smiled, and her grey
eyes glowed with warmth so lovingly lovely that Seraphima knew that she,
Seraphima, was in meltdown. 

������.

&nbsp;

�Let me pay for the dressing
gown then.�

&nbsp;

��Fraid it�s not that easy
madam. Theft is theft yer know. Do these �ere rubber close belong to yer
missus?�

&nbsp;

�Yes, they�re Seraphima�s�

&nbsp;

�When will yer missus be
�ome?�

������.

&nbsp;

�Thank you for your
attention. I hope at least some of you were listening to the lecture and not
just looking at me�.�

&nbsp;

Kate giggled, and then
blushed at her self-conscious joke and admission that she knew that, because
she was so devastatingly pretty, she was being ogled by every girl in the room.

&nbsp;

�You will be relieved to hear
that we have a short coffee break now, and then I have a syndicate exercise for
you all�. Now don�t groan!�, she teased and smiled.

&nbsp;

Kate smiled anew as she
walked straight over to the Nubian angel at the break: �How�s your room Seraphima?
The old �Titular Hotel� is just a tad old fashioned, but they have always made
us very welcome�.

&nbsp;

Seraphima caught the
sunlight sparkling on the soft blonde hairs on Kate�s slim forearms, and was
completely disarmed.

&nbsp;

But, before Seraphima could
answer, Kate turned to respond to another attendee.

&nbsp;

�Excuse me butting in Kate,
but whilst your opening lecture was fine, if a little pro-Freudian in its
otherwise perspicacious summation of the post-suffragette stratagem and
dilemma, what about the Marxian dialectic? When we discuss the feminine
experience, shouldn�t the Marxian �thesis, antithesis, synthesis� analytical
triumvirate enter the fray, stage-left, at the start of the day?�, Seraphima
heard the other attendee expound, with blue-stockings in evident display, and
obviously not only on her long legs, which had probably never yet been splayed.

&nbsp;

A quick glance at and from
Kate showed that the petite posy wanted still to talk to Seraphima. And a
second look from Kate at Seraphima, found Seraphima aghast at the obscure
query, and made Kate have to fight to hold back a peel of appealing giggles, at
the sight of the astonishment on Seraphima�s face.

&nbsp;

As she returned to front-up the
lecture once more, Kate avoided Seraphima�s eyes, knowing that she had made her
point with the Nubian negress, and that it was now for Seraphima to make the
next play.

������.

&nbsp;

�Let me pay for the dressing
gown then.�

&nbsp;

��Fraid it�s not that easy
madam. Theft is theft yer know. Do these �ere rubber close belong to yer
missus?�

&nbsp;

�Yes, they�re Seraphima�s�

&nbsp;

�When will yer missus be
�ome?�

&nbsp;

�She�s only just left for
Enabe�.. She�s on a residential course I decided I did not want to go to�.in an
hotel there��

������.

&nbsp;

�Kate!�, Seraphima called,
as lecturer and lectured went to lunch. And the lovely blonde angel turned with
her smiling eyes, and Seraphima�s longings now definitely belonged to love.

&nbsp;

�Are you in� Do you have
room �69�? You see I� I noticed you left your key at the back of the lecture
room, so I�ve tucked it in my stocking top for safekeeping�.�

&nbsp;

Kate blushed. �Thank you
Seraphima. That�s perfectly fine�, she smiled, and then blushed again, obviously
registering that her heavenly loveliness had scored a palpable hit with the
stunning negress. 

������.

&nbsp;

At lunch, Kate showed she
knew that, to continue to reel Seraphima in for real, she really no longer had
to be other than her sweet self.

&nbsp;

As the two girls sat
opposite each other, she just talked and giggled naturally, although her face,
her eyes in particular, showed that she was just loving having her delightful
prettiness admired.

&nbsp;

Of course Kate had seen the
wedding ring. But Kate was a �modern girl� and saw such trinkets as no fence or
defence against the natural fulfilment of love�s longings.

&nbsp;

For her part, Seraphima had
clearly been changed by her whip-rape.

&nbsp;

During the brutal experience
itself, her old self, the married girl who would never ever break her vow, had
still asserted itself, and she had resisted Teasetta, despite her agony.

&nbsp;

It had been in the weeks
since that, subconsciously initially, change had begun.

&nbsp;

Despite her old self,
Seraphima had been taken by the whip.

&nbsp;

Okay, it was hindsight, but
she should have interposed a leg to deflect the stroke that had invaded her.
The fact that she did not know that particular stroke was aimed at taking her,
was no excuse. She should, she told herself, have kept her legs together at all
times to protect her wifely virtue.

&nbsp;

This initial conclusion, and
her consequent guilt, had quite depressed Seraphima for some time after the
whip-rape.

&nbsp;

Marina, lovely Marina, had
soon realised the guilt Seraphima was feeling for having orgasmed under the
lash, and kept reassuring her wife that she understood, and that there was no
cause for such feelings: and even that she, Marina, would have done the same if
Teasetta had been bullwhipping her.

&nbsp;

But Seraphima knew that
nobody whom had not themselves been whip-raped, could possibly understand. Her
guilt was not only from the knowledge that she had surrendered; but also from
the need to have the incredibly intense experience over again.

&nbsp;

This latter was never fully
admitted by Seraphima�s conscious mind. When it did briefly surface though, she
told herself too, as was undoubtedly true, that the intensity could not be the
same as the first time; because the first time was the only time in which she
would ever not know that it was coming.

&nbsp;

Dissatisfaction with Marina
in bed was something the whip-rape had also almost immediately fed.

&nbsp;

Seraphima�s eyes had began
to roam. She began to realise that there was a whole panorama of girls in the
world, and not just the girl she was wed to at home.

&nbsp;

Marina and Seraphima knew
each other too well for the bedroom experience now to be anything other than
routine.

&nbsp;

Though they still shared the
same bed, the intervals between their lovemaking had been growing longer.
Seraphima had hoped that this would heighten the experience by renewing it, but
had been disappointed on that score. 

&nbsp;

Marina, for her part, had
assumed Seraphima�s apparently lowered desire was the outcome of the whipping,
and had been sweet enough to sacrifice her own needs to the wish she assumed
Seraphima had, to �re-virginalise� her body as it were.

&nbsp;

Without either girl
realising it, or at least without either admitting it to herself, let alone the
other, their physical love had become stale, staid, and was withering on the
vine.

������

&nbsp;

�Stop looking at me!�, Kate
shyly commanded, as she found herself blushing under the constant adoring gaze
of Seraphima�s dark-brown eyes, with the lovely negress transfixed by her smile
and her moist lips.

&nbsp;

As she lowered her adoring
gaze, and fought not to look at pretty Kate, Seraphima, smiled anew.

&nbsp;

Then, mini-moments later,
Kate tapped Seraphima�s hand and commanded: �Look at me!�, and Seraphima smiled
again at Kate�s charmingly contradictory femininity.

������.

&nbsp;

�Let me pay for the dressing
gown then.�

&nbsp;

��Fraid it�s not that easy
madam. Theft is theft yer know. Do these �ere rubber close belong to yer
missus?�

&nbsp;

�Yes, they�re Seraphima�s�

&nbsp;

�When will yer missus be
�ome?�

&nbsp;

�She�s only just left for
Enabe�.. She�s on a residential course I decided I did not want to go to�.in an
hotel there��

&nbsp;

�An� where more hegsactly
would dat be at madam?� 

������.

&nbsp;

Seraphima apologised as she
left the lecture room. The display on her mobile told her the call was from
Marina. Seraphima feared something dreadful had happened. There was no real
justification for such concern, save that her wife would surely not phone when
she would have known Seraphima would most likely be in a lecture, unless there
was some kind of problem.

&nbsp;

�Girl-Police�. Dressing gown
came home in after the whipping�. Feel so dreadful�.. Betrayal darling�.. God
forgive me but you know what they are like�.. I had to tell�.. They must be on
their way�. Please forgive me my love�. Please!!� Marina babbled.

&nbsp;

Seraphima swallowed hard.
She had quite forgotten the dressing gown.

&nbsp;

�You have done nothing of
the sort darling. �Betrayal� is a dreadful word, and one I will never ever
associate with you. If they are on their way, they are on their way. Please
don�t worry yourself so about it. I had some dealings with the Girl-Police when
I lived in England, and I found them perfectly willing to listen. I�ll explain
everything. I�m certain sure there will be no problem�.� Seraphima responded,
with a calmness she certainly did not feel.

&nbsp;

�Darling�. Please run away
somewhere: anywhere! �.�, Marina sobbed.

&nbsp;

�I�ll be home tomorrow. You
are even beginning to worry me now. Ask Camilleona to warm some of her milk for
you. Talk to her, and, above all sweetheart, don�t worry so. I love you.
Everything will be all right. I�ve got to go. I love you. Kisses. Bye! ��

&nbsp;

As she pressed the button to
end the call, Seraphima felt an acidic river run through her tummy. There was
no point in trying to run. �Some of the Girl-Police could be very nice women�,
she heard her imagination saying, but not believing.

&nbsp;

A deep breath raised her
lovely bosom proudly high.

&nbsp;

Seraphima placed her mobile
back behind the garter on her left thigh. Her hands were shaking: her tongue
dry. But she knew she would just have to wait and see what would happen.
Running would only make matters worse; that was for sure.

&nbsp;

Another deep breath, and
Seraphima wiggled back into the lecture, signalling with waved fingers and a
silent mouthed �Sorry� to Kate for the interruption, as she, Seraphima, sat
herself down once more.

������.

&nbsp;

Hours later and Seraphima�s
worries were well in the background. What on earth had Marina been on about?
Talk about unnecessary panic. If the Girl-Police had really been on their way,
then they must have taken the longest route imaginable, or else completely lost
their bearings. Seraphima would have to talk girl-to-girl with Marina about
this when she got home!

������.

&nbsp;

Lectures over, and another
phone call, this time from Seraphima to Marina, had assured and reassured
Marina that all was well, and that she, Marina, was worrying about nothing.

&nbsp;

Dinner followed and love
grew and showed, as Kate and Seraphima glowed.

������.

&nbsp;

As they rose from their
barstools, after the other pupils had long since dispersed to the bedrooms
following the end of the first day of the course, Kate smiled.

&nbsp;

Love was in the air. The two
girls had chatted endlessly and increasingly intensely. Seraphima, as she was
wont, had avoided overmuch detail about her cloistered upbringing, and
subsequent experiences at the hands of the English Girl-Courts.

&nbsp;

Kate had told of her wealthy
mother, her brilliant sisters, and her own rise through education, with a doctorate
from Vale in the USA at age fifteen, and all the opportunities that had
brought. The opportunities that the acutely astute Seraphima had never had an
chance to pursue.

&nbsp;

Along the way, it transpired
that Kate was originally from Camford, the university town near Spindon:
Spindon being where Seraphima originally hailed from. Kate was now a professor
of women�s affairs at Ntobi University, and was clearly in love with life in
Senabre.

&nbsp;

The other pupils gathered
around each other, and left the petite pretty lecturer to be monopolised by the
lovely negress. The two were so obviously wrapped in each other, that nobody
wanted to disturb them and, after a while, nobody continued to observe them.

&nbsp;

As they rose from their
barstools, after the other pupils had long since dispersed to the bedrooms
following the end of the first day of the course, Kate smiled.

&nbsp;

�Have you still got my room
key safe Seraphima: because I want you to meet Mandy?�

&nbsp;

At the querulous crestfallen
look that immediately befell Seraphima�s lovely face, Kate raised her pretty
hand to her ever-moist lips and giggled, with her grey eyes flashing diamond
sparkles.

&nbsp;

�Mandy is my girlfriend�,
she teased, with a hint of naughty taunt, and a �didn�t you realise I was
already spoken for� intonation to her voice, as she continued to giggle.

&nbsp;

Seraphima�s look still
showed the surprise she thought she had succeeded in hiding, and made Kate
laugh gently, but all the more intensely.

&nbsp;

A while later, as the girls
held hands in the upstairs corridor, Kate playfully recited the bedroom door
numbers: ��. 63�. 65�. 67�.�

&nbsp;

�Oh dear. 67 is your room
isn�t it Seraphima? Mmm I�m sure it is! So soon!! Oh well. Oh well �..
goodnight then�..�, Kate whisper-teased in a resigned tone, pretending the
evening was over and Seraphima to go to her own room alone.

&nbsp;

But Kate had such loving
laughter in her eyes that Seraphima just knew that new giggles were on their
lovely way. And, anyway, Kate never let go Seraphima�s hand during this tease.

&nbsp;

And now she grasped both
Seraphima�s hands and walked backwards, pulling as if she had to haul Seraphima
along from Seraphima�s reluctance, which made Seraphima laugh too.

&nbsp;

�And�.. here we are, 69�,
Kate�s eyes continued to shine with fun, with her voice tickled by the bare suppression
of her lovely laughter.

&nbsp;

When they had reached the
doorway of room 69, Kate turned her back to the door, and tried to fill its
frame with her petite five-foot-three. She then held her right hand out, palm
upward, fingers prettily bending surprisingly far down toward the ground, to
signal that she wished Seraphima to give her the key.

&nbsp;

�Oooh it�s still warm� Kate
pouted teasingly, as Seraphima placed the key, Kate had clearly enjoyed
watching her take from the top of her right stocking, onto Kate�s sweet palm.

&nbsp;

�Shh!� said Kate, with a
clear hint of yet more giggles, as she turned the key in the door and pushed it
open: �We mustn�t wake Mandy�, she whispered in a silly serious tone.

&nbsp;

Once inside, with the room�s
lights on, Seraphima had no time to look further than Kate�s adorably pretty
face, as the young girl suddenly moved her head sideways, and took her sweet
soft moist lips in a Cupid�s flight over Seraphima�s �O� for orgasm closed
mouth, without touchdown.

&nbsp;

�We mustn�t kwiss�, Kate
then said suddenly, as if startled, with her grey eyes intensely wide with cod
seriousness, mixed with suppressed laughter: �Mandy would be swo jwealous!�,
she pouted.

&nbsp;

�Close your eyes Seraphima�,
Kate giggled anew, as she then took Seraphima by her right hand, holding that
right hand in both her lovely hands, and led Seraphima, with Kate on
dramatically slow leggy tiptoe, to the bed.

&nbsp;

�Shh!� Kate whispered as she
let go Seraphima�s hand, and raised her dainty forefinger to her shiny lips.

&nbsp;

Seraphima, eyes open, openly
helplessly dazzled by this sexy girl, was in a daze ablaze.

&nbsp;

And then, Kate leaned over
the bed and whispered to a ragged old teddybear tucked under the duvet, with
its stubby arms tucked under too, so that only its face, with its nose ears and
ever-open eyes stared up. 

&nbsp;

�Mandy, I want you to meet
Seraphima; she�s weally wuvly!� Kate whispered in her teddybear toy�s left ear.
And Seraphima fell instantly fully head over heels in love with Kate.

&nbsp;

�Say hello to Mandy,
Seraphima!� Kate then commanded with a sexy seriousness, belied by the lovely
sparkle in her eyes.

&nbsp;

Seraphima moved in front of
Kate, bent over and kissed the teddybear on its nose.

&nbsp;

�Oooh. Mandy weally wuved
that�, Kate affirmed, with a little-girl pout.

&nbsp;

Kate then stage whispered in
the teddybear�s ear: �You got the first kwiss from Seraphima. I�m weally
jwealous Mandy! But I still wuv you!� and she kissed the teddybear�s nose in
turn.

������.

&nbsp;

�Let me pay for the dressing
gown then.�

&nbsp;

��Fraid it�s not that easy
madam. Theft is theft yer know. Do these �ere rubber close belong to yer
missus?�

&nbsp;

�Yes, they�re Seraphima�s�

&nbsp;

�When will yer missus be
�ome?�

&nbsp;

�She�s only just left for
Enabe�.. She�s on a residential course I decided I did not want to go to�.in an
hotel there��

&nbsp;

�An� where more hegsactly
would dat be at madam?�

&nbsp;

�The Titular Hotel�, Marina
confirmed, with tears running down her face, both from her fear of the
Girl-Police, and from her consequent betrayal.

������.

&nbsp;

As she rose from kissing the
teddybear, Kate fell into Seraphima�s arms, and again reached up on top of very
top tiptoe to fly her sensuously moist lips over and over and over Seraphima�s
longing mouth, without touching.

&nbsp;

Seraphima understood the
message, and played along, as Kate brushed her pretty face over and over, and
across Seraphima�s, teasingly, pleasingly, hauntingly, tauntingly,
dreamily-erotically, trying to see how close the two girls could get their lips
without them actually kissing: torturing them both: making them both await the
first kiss they longed for.

&nbsp;

Then Kate stopped her
torment; darted out the tip of her tongue to touch on Seraphima�s top lip, and
sweetly whispered: �That�s all!� and turned away, with a giggle.

&nbsp;

But that was not going to be
all, and Seraphima took the petite angel in her arms and kissed her beautiful
mouth with a gentle intensity; that Kate swiftly outmatched, and they lingered
thus for an endless age, till�

&nbsp;

�Let�s move away from Mandy
shall we. We don�t want to make her jealous��, Kate whispered, her eyes now
dream-filled and shy, as she took Seraphima�s hand, and led her from the bed to
a couch, where the two angels continued to kiss, and to explore the explosive
eroticism, of foreplay that was no �fore� to anything other than itself, as
they simply kissed, and broke away, and kissed once more.

&nbsp;

And Seraphima�s hand held
the angel�s neck and caressed her back only so as to keep Kate�s lips on hers.
And then she kissed Kate�s neck and Kate gasped with the pleasure. And Kate
gave award for the pleasure, measure for measure, by kissing Seraphima�s mouth
with a gentle intensity, that showed that both girls now knew how the other
wanted to be kissed, and that both were willing and wanting of kissing to
please.

&nbsp;

And Kate eased her top�s
strap off her shoulder to bare her neck more, and Seraphima kissed her neck
once more. And the moist mouth of the little blonde tease knew how to please as
it budded, then pouted, and then blossomed its lips on, and within Seraphima�s:
then stopped.

&nbsp;

The kiss stopped with both
girls fixed with their lips on each other�s, as if in a game of dare, to see
which cared the more so as to be the one to begin the kissing again.

&nbsp;

But the game�s rules were
disobeyed as Seraphima broke away and kissed Kate�s neck yet again, and Kate�s
fire was rekindled and her mouth flew moist to Seraphima�s, and her little cry betrayed
that the eroticism of the compassionate conflagration, had moistened other lips
of hers. And she kissed now with her soul. And time stood eternal. And the
minutes flew to hours. And the hours flew too quickly; and yet not at all, as
the girls kissed; and then kissed; and then kissed; and then kissed; and then
kissed; and then kissed anew�

&nbsp;

�.And a master-key turned in
the bedroom door, and the Girl-Police bungled in�.

������.

&nbsp;

�Sorry to barge in like
dis�, a shapely blonde with a sergeant�s stripes on her well endowed, literally
double-breasted tunic, conveyed, with practiced insincerity.

&nbsp;

�I�m Sergeant Pat Butt. �Ope
me and Constable Cretina Critic �ere isn�t interrupting nuffink�, she
sarcasmed.

&nbsp;

�Night Porter said as �ow
she�d seen you two �oldin �ands to the elevator. Knew you�d be in 67 or 69.
Good of you to leave the light on soas we�d know which�.�.

&nbsp;

Seraphima became aware of
Kate�s fear-fuelled trembling, and put a reassuring arm around the angel.

&nbsp;

�We�ll take a seat on the
edge of the bed �ere if yer don�t mind. Do carry on what you was doin� if yer
want to�, the sergeant mocked.

&nbsp;

�No? Oh! Oh well. Na den:
you�d be Seraphima Ntebeli, if I isn�t mistaken�, the sergeant continued,
looking at her brunette companion, and nodding for her to open her notebook,
just after she had looked Seraphima in her lovely face.

&nbsp;

�Course it�s none of my
business what was a goin� on just �ere, afore now. But I suppose you being
called � let�s see na �. yea �.. MRS Ntebeli, means you is married, MRS Ntebeli.
Would dat be about right?� the sergeant enquired with indifference to deference
in her monotone.

&nbsp;

�Yes. Yes of course�
Seraphima answered.

&nbsp;

�We was talkin� to your wife
earlier� a Mrs Marina Ntebeli? Your good lady said as �ow we�d find you at dis
�otel.�

&nbsp;

��As she bin in touch, to
tell you we was coming like?�

&nbsp;

�No�, Seraphima lied.

&nbsp;

�Just as well dat. We told
�er not to, if she knew what was good for �er like�, the sergeant mused.

&nbsp;

�Like I were saying, your good
lady said as �ow we�d find you at dis �otel. Don�t �spose she�d �ave known
whose room you�d be in doe�, the sarcastic sergeant speculated in order, as she
intended, to gain.

&nbsp;

�But we is very discretion
in the Girl-Police Mrs Ntebeli. Very discretion indeed: if you sees where I is
getting to�, she continued.

&nbsp;

�We �ave a few questions for
you Mrs Ntebeli. So, let us say dat, if you gives us de answers what we is
lookin� for, we won�t say nuffink nowhere to nobody abart you and dat pretty
little tart you got yer arm around just now: eh?�

&nbsp;

Without waiting for an
answer, the sergeant continued: �Your good lady, Mrs Marina, ses you brought
�ome this �ere white robe, the dressing gown what Constable Critic �ere is a
showin� you�, she averred.

&nbsp;

�Yes�, Seraphima answered,
�I�d had a part in a movie: a western. I put it on after I had been whipped for
real. I was bleeding and could not bear to wear anything tighter� I needed to
get home. I must have left my own clothes behind. I was in a lot of pain. My
mind was in turmoil. I had just been whip-raped�.�

&nbsp;

Without being able to, or
daring to turn and see, Seraphima felt the look of total astonishment, followed
by pained tender loving sympathy, on Kate�s face.

&nbsp;

�Was you in the changin�
room: de changin� caravan, what was also bein� used by the actress what was
playin� a character called �Sexy Red� � woman by the name of Teasetta
Loveschild?� the sergeant continued.

&nbsp;

�Yes. Yes I shared
Teasetta�s caravan, we were on location, though not far from my home as it happens�..�
Seraphima responded.

&nbsp;

�So. So den, dis �ere
dressing gown what we found in the laundry from your �ome, in the �ands of your
�orny little maid, Camilleona, when she was a washin� it down by der river
trying to get the blood out of it, was taken by you from Mrs Teasetta
Loveschild. Would dat be about right?�

&nbsp;

Seraphima was all too aware
she was about to incriminate herself, but boldly bravely answered simply:
�Yes�.

&nbsp;

�Got the notes on all that
constable?�

&nbsp;

�Yea sarge� the constable
replied.

&nbsp;

�Read �em out den Constable
Critic. Read �em out, and try and get past de first page of what �as been writ
down will yer, just for a change like!� Sergeant Pat Butt teased, elephantinely
inelegantly.

&nbsp;

Constable Cretina Critic was
clearly not the sharpest knife in the draw. She obviously had difficulty in
reading, let alone enjoying, anything that was not boringly straightforward and
tediously predicable. Indeed, when it came to reading them back, even her own
comments were somehow apparently seen, to her self-righteous dullard�s mind, as
pseudo-clever nonsense.

&nbsp;

�Sign the constable�s
notebook and, if your little lady will witness your signature like, we can
leave you be, for the time bein� luv�, the sergeant confirmed, as Seraphima
duly signed, as she dare not do otherwise, and Kate nervously countersigned as
witness.

&nbsp;

�Don�t fink you�ve �eard the
last of dis darlin�. There�s bound to be a court case�, the sergeant confirmed,
to Seraphima�s slightly relieved astonishment. Astonishment based on the
reasoned assumption she was surely about to be arrested for theft on the spot:
relief that it had not happened.

&nbsp;

The sarcastic English
sergeant, an individual relic of the old colonial days for Senabre: the days
before it had left the British Empire and changed its name from British
Senaban: the sarcastic English sergeant looked around the room, and ogled
pretty Kate, who lowered her eyes in terror.

&nbsp;

�You oughta get yerself a
girl wiv some tits on luv�, she sneered to Seraphima, nodding toward, to
indicate she was talking about Kate.

&nbsp;

�Your little tart �ere ain�t
got none as I can see. Maybe she was last in line when the tits was bein�
�anded out eh? They musta run outta titties afore she got ter the front of the
queue, cos there�s none on the front of �er, that�s for sure, eh!?!� the
sergeant cruelly mocked, to her and her constable�s evident and sole amusement.

&nbsp;

�One more fing�, the
sergeant began, with her tongue in her cheek, literally, momentarily, as she
gave a �listen to this one� look at her companion constable�.

&nbsp;

�One more fing�, the
sergeant continued, �Is it true that you �ad a cum when you was bein� whipped?�

&nbsp;

�Yes�, Seraphima confessed,
as she hung her head in shame.

&nbsp;

�Really big �un: a
multi-one, is what I �eard�, the sergeant confirmed, �In fact I �eard you was
gaggin for it: beggin for more�.�

&nbsp;

�No need to answer that�n
luv. It wasn�t no question��, she then sneared.

&nbsp;

The Girl-Police now left,
but as the bedroom door had nearly closed, it opened again, and the sergeant
put her head around it to say:

&nbsp;

�Do carry on what you was a
doin� of, won�t yer!�

&nbsp;

And just after the door
finally closed, Seraphima heard the mocking laughter recede, as the Girl-Police
re-entered the elevator to leave the hotel.

������.

&nbsp;

Shame filled, Seraphima knew
she had failed Kate. She had let the exquisite girl be mocked, and herself
denigrated in turn, and done about it that which all women who faced the
Girl-Police, were able to do: that is: precisely nothing.

&nbsp;

�I am so sorry about that,
my love�, Seraphima whispered.

&nbsp;

�It was not your fault
Seraphima�, Kate answered, with a new distance evident, despite her smile.

&nbsp;

Seraphima turned to leave,
and go to her own room.

&nbsp;

She then turned again and
whispered: �Kiss Mandy goodnight for me won�t you Kate��

&nbsp;

�Of course I will�.�, Kate
answered, with sweet tears welling in her gorgeous grey eyes.

������.

&nbsp;

Five minutes later, as
Seraphima finished her third phone chat with Marina, this one to tell her the Girl-Police
had just been, and that nothing had happened; there came a knock at her door.

&nbsp;

Terrified that the
Girl-Police had come to make the arrest she feared must happen at any time
soon; but equally too frightened of the Girl-Police not to open the door,
Seraphima emotioned over and turned the key.

&nbsp;

As she eased the door ajar
to see who was there, a whispered voice asked: �Can Mandy and I come in?�

&nbsp;

Seraphima opened the door a
little wider, and, hugging Mandy in her arms, a stark naked Kate walked confidently
across her carpet, and slid herself under the duvet on Seraphima�s bed.

&nbsp;

Tears came to Seraphima�s
eyes as she watched, transfixed, the exquisite angel traipse across the room,
and saw a flash of Kate�s little breasts and her innocently-hairless,
very-tight-lipped slit.

&nbsp;

�Mandy says she thinks I�m
in love with you�, Kate explained with a gentle smile. Then she cuddled her
teddybear in her lovely arms, turned on her side, and fell instantly into sweet
sleep.

Chapter 5 � Mule

&nbsp;

The card Kate had left on the bedside table had been amended
in manuscript.

&nbsp;

In print it read: �Professor Kate I. S. Godsgift, Faculty of
Women�s Studies, University of Ntobi�,
and included Kate�s work and home telephone numbers. The manuscript insertion
added, just after Kate�s surname, read: �and Miss Mandy Teddy�.

&nbsp;

As she picked up the card clipped in the pocket-clasp of her
borrowed fountain pen, Seraphima smiled, and then quietly laughed. Rising
gracefully from her bed, she swept her beautiful black body to the shower and
turned the water on, feeling with her right hand to check, before adjusting its
temperature, and slipping under the reign of its rain.

&nbsp;

The shower had obviously not been used before that morning,
so the deduction that Kate must have commuted for the card, before finally
returning to her next-door room to prepare for her day, was clearly proven.

&nbsp;

There was just a half-day of the course to go: then the
journey home.

&nbsp;

Returning fresh from her shower with a
towel as cowl on her head, Seraphima patted dry her long pubic hair with a
second towel, as she contemplated what to do next.

&nbsp;

Nothing had happened with Kate during the night. Both girls,
all three girls, if Mandy was included, had shared the same bed; but about that
event there is no more to be said.

&nbsp;

Okay, so the two girls had wrapped their lovely arms around
each other; but Mandy had thus been cuddled between them, and ensured that
there had been naught naughtiness.

&nbsp;

Guilt had come on the scene. Seraphima knew she had betrayed
Marina. But guilt can be such a
golden experience, even if one does not admit to oneself than one is wallowing
in its glistering waters.

&nbsp;

Seraphima determined she would start her day with a jog to
jolt her. She was no fitness fanatic, but had kept an acquaintance with the
gymnasium and running, and had increased her familiarity as her sexual
frustration, from the cooling marriage she now knew, had gradually grown.

&nbsp;

Donning trainers latterly, Seraphima wound her pubic hair
into plaits now wrapped and tied tight around her strong thighs, and wore a
restraining training tank-top, straining to do its best in requesting her
breasts be at rest, at its hopeless request; and a pair of shorts, both in
close-clinging cerise rubber.

&nbsp;

Unfamiliar with the streets of Enabe, she put the room key
in a pocket of her shorts, as she gave grace to the corridors of the brownstone
Titular Hotel, and swung her sexy rear and bare midriff to near its doors, to
escape for her run, determining to note landmarks, so as not to lose her way
back.

&nbsp;

Even running on the spot outside to warm her muscles for the
run to come, gave the new day a dance and prance glance of Seraphima�s advanced
chest, as her breasts flicked up in unison when she powered down, and then down
when she kneed up, as if they were determined to be conspicuous by their
completely contradictory capering.

�������..

&nbsp;

Kate looked at the watch that she had to haul back around
her delicate wrist to see its face, and worried that sweet Seraphima was not in
her place.

&nbsp;

She had stalled for almost twenty minutes, and the other
pupils were becoming restless.

&nbsp;

She asked again: �Are you sure none of you has seen
Seraphima, not even at breakfast?�

&nbsp;

�No. Sorry Kate. ��I expect she overslept or went home, or something�. Can we get on please?�,
the �blue stocking� insisted.

&nbsp;

�Yes. Yes, of course. We have a lot to pack into this
morning ladies. Lunch will be at noon
sharp. That will give you this afternoon in which to make your journeys home:
some of which I know are long��, Kate routined, as she tried to forget her
anxiety, and get to the first exercise for her pupils, so that she could slip
out of the lecture room, and up to Seraphima�s bedroom.

�������..

&nbsp;

Not far from the hotel, Seraphima was regretting having not
taking more notice of the eye signal.

&nbsp;

She had gone no more than one-hundred yards when she had
come across the pony-cart with two Petian girls in towing harness at its front.

&nbsp;

Of course she knew that the light-blue thongs the statuesque
honeys wore, marked them, and thus their vehicle, as
Girl-Police ponies and their cart. But she had taken the signal from the
blinkered eyes of one of the two mouth-bit gagged ponygirls, as signifying that
she should run on the sidewalk pavement rather than risk the road.

&nbsp;

The signally swift signal sidling of the ponygirls lovely
ruby red eyes, to indicate impending danger in the direction behind her, had
not been read as a warning. Of course neither girl knew the other. Both were
strangers. But the ponygirl was no stranger to the risk she was trying to
signal to sweet Seraphima.

&nbsp;

Around the corner Seraphima flew, and then almost cried out
with horror, as a voice called out behind her, not recognising her,
momentarily:

&nbsp;

�Nah den! Nah den! Let�s �ave a bit of an �alt from you young lady. Just what yer runnin� away from den. You bin robbing dat
dare �otel? Eh?! �

&nbsp;

Well�. Well�.. Well, and bloody �ell too. If it ain�t Mrs
Ntebeli�, Sergeant Pat Butt suddenly realised.

&nbsp;

Seraphima stopped on the
spot. She knew it was useless to try and escape. She knew only too well that
she had to await the sergeant�s permission for her to continue her mission.

&nbsp;

�Constable Critic!� the
sergeant called: �Come over �ere. There�s a girl �ere in need of a serious
talking to by you and me.�

&nbsp;

If Seraphima had guessed
that Sergeant Butt ruled the area of Enabe she was presently in, by force of
shear terror, she would not have been wrong. 

&nbsp;

Critic, was just her dullard follower. Butt worked her patch
with ruthless despatch. Crime in the precinct she patrolled was very low, not
because it did not take place, but because it was never reported, unless Butt
failed to get a slice of the proceeds, or some other form of pay-off.

&nbsp;

The Titular Hotel was not
alone in paying her protection money. Reporting her to her seniors was also a
waste of effort, since Butt paid them handsomely to keep off her back.

&nbsp;

�Constable Critic!� Sergeant
Butt called: �Come over �ere. There�s a girl �ere in need of a serious talking to
by you and me.�

&nbsp;

�Come in �ere you gorgeous black tart�, Butt beckoned, after
barging open the doorway of a derelict shop with her shoulder. 

�������..

&nbsp;

�I think Camilleona has got
a girlfriend�

&nbsp;

No: that wouldn�t do.

&nbsp;

�I think our Camilleona has
got herself a girl�

&nbsp;

Not much better.

&nbsp;

�You�ll have noticed that
Camilleona has gone? I think she�s got a girlfriend�

&nbsp;

If that was the best Marina could come up with, she was never going to get away
with this.

�������..

&nbsp;

Kate tapped on the door of
room 67. There was no answer. She turned to the desk clerk.

&nbsp;

�Would you mind awfully? You
see she�s almost an hour overdue, and I feel responsible for her, even if she
is just one of my students�.�.

�������..

&nbsp;

�Come over �ere� the
sergeant beckoned to Seraphima, indicating a rubble-strewn corner of the former
butcher�s shop.

&nbsp;

�You and
�er. �Er what you was wiv last
night. �Er wiv no tits. You and �er; are you lezzies?�

�������..

&nbsp;

The clerk turned the passkey
and opened the door of number 67, calling: �Mrs Ntebeli! Are you okay madam?�

&nbsp;

Both girls finding the room
empty: �Are you sure she came back from her run?� she asked Kate once again.

�������..

&nbsp;

�You see, me and the
constable �ere, we don�t like lezzies�, Butt sneared. Do we Critic?�

&nbsp;

Critic grinned inanely: �No
sarge, we don�t like lezzies do we sarge?� she echoed.

&nbsp;

To Seraphima�s terror, the
sergeant drew her baton, and held it up to Seraphima�s face, before putting it
down, thrusting upright from her own groin, and waggling it, as if it were a
rampant erect penis.

&nbsp;

�What you lezzies need is a
bit of dis�, she sneared, as she masturbated the mock cock�s absent foreskin,
with her left hand.

&nbsp;

�Yea �a bit of dis�; I mean
a bit of dat�, Critic echoed, latterly pointing.

�������..

&nbsp;

The room being empty: �Do
you think there might have been an accident?� Kate trembled. �Would you call
the police: please!� she almost begged.

&nbsp;

�Excuse me madam, but I�m
afraid there is not much use in calling the police around here. They are�.
shall we say�. a little unreliable?�

&nbsp;

�Oh god! We must do something!� Kate cried in voice and
tears.

&nbsp;

�I will organise a search
for you madam. Mrs Ntbeli was the lovely black girl with the gorgeous lips?�

&nbsp;

�Yes. Oh
god yes!� Kate cried once more.

&nbsp;

�Please don�t worry madam:
the staff know the locality well. We�ll search the
hotel and around all the nearby streets, and ask too if she has been seen.
These things usually have a simple explanation, and a happy outcome�, the clerk
tried to reassure the distraught angel.

�������..

&nbsp;

�Fancy a bit of dis, do
yer?� Butt snarled as she waved the twelve-inch-long baton under Seraphima�s
nose again.

&nbsp;

�Please don�t hurt me�,
Seraphima begged.

&nbsp;

�Get �em off lezzie. Let�s
�ave a good look at what you got that gets all the girls going goggle-eyed for
yer�.

�������..

&nbsp;

�Did you know that little
Camilleona has found a steady girlfriend?�

&nbsp;

It was getting worse.

&nbsp;

�Camilleona has left us to
live in an apartment near where I work: near the boathouse, as it happens�.

&nbsp;

God no! That was just awful.
The �girlfriend� needed mention in there somewhere.

&nbsp;

�Isn�t that just like
slaves? You take them in, you treat them as one of the family, you could
legally thrash them, but you don�t. And what reward do you get? They go off
with the first girl that seduces them, and live in a paid for apartment��. It�s
Camilleona I�m talking about of course. She�s only gone and left us would you
believe! �.�.

&nbsp;

That was the best so far,
but even if it would win no Oscars.

&nbsp;

Marina gently bit her lower lip as she ticked matters over
in her mind.

�������..

&nbsp;

�Fwarrh! You�re a big girl ain�t ya�, Butt almost slavered as
she gazed excitedly at Seraphima�s slowly swinging bared breasts, with their
huge pink-brown nipples.

&nbsp;

Seraphima was shivering with
fear, and her lovely bosom quivered a quiver of Eros� arrows toward the hard
hearts of the two Girl-Police, who lasciviously watched her shaking struggle to
undress, even out of as little as she had been presently wearing.

&nbsp;

��Ere
lezzie! By making your tits dance
about like that, you ain�t giving us �the old come on�, is you?� the sergeant
mocked.

&nbsp;

�Oh! Please!� Seraphima
cried.

&nbsp;

The shorts were lowered over
Seraphima�s gorgeous bum and down her incredible thighs, and she shaped her
lovely legs unavoidably erotically as she stepped out of these trunks, leaving
herself nude bar her trainers.

&nbsp;

At the sight of the pubic
hair tied around Seraphima�s thighs, Butt went but wild. Her eyes shone with
viciousness as she urged Constable Cretina Critic to grab hold of the other of
the two plaits she had untied and was unwinding.

&nbsp;

�Oh gawd! What �ave we got �ere den lezzie? You forget to
shave did yer? You forgot yer razor for fuckin� years by the looks of it. Cor,
fuckin� �ell. Where�d yer get so much of an �airy Nellie.
You must be some slag to have let it grow like that! But den all lezzies is
slags ain�t dey?!� the sergeant chortled as she snided.

&nbsp;

As the two Girl-Police made
her run crabwise in a circle, sidling around in the room, grabbed by the
six-foot long tresses of her dark brown pubic curls, pulling on her sensitive
lips as she enforcedly whirled, Seraphima�s screams were as in dreams, if all
dreams are nightmares.

&nbsp;

�Like dis do you lezzie,
eh?! Raand and raand we go. �Ere, dis is great lezzie, int
it? �Ope it don�t �urt: least not a little bit, you fuckin� lezzie cow!�

&nbsp;

Now they took one each of
her plaits out front and rear of her, and made Seraphima screech as they played
seesaw, pulling her back and forth by her pubic tresses, and laughing fit to
give sewage drains a good name, in their savage cruelty, torturing Seraphima�s
cunt lips more and more: and yet.

&nbsp;

�To you
constable! No? Back
to me den. Your way! Now back �ere. You�d fink the fucking lezzie slag
would mek �er bleeding mind up, wever she�s coming or fucking going wouldn�t
you constable: eh?!�

&nbsp;

Making her kneel, they
pulled Seraphima up to a half-stand on her pretty hands, as she howled from
being hauled aloft by the soft hair of her Venus mound: and yet.

&nbsp;

�Ups-a-daisy. Up we comes lezzie. Does that
�urt? �Ope so, you fucking slag.�

&nbsp;

And now Seraphima must crawl wheelbarrow on her palms, lifted aloft by the soft
curls that denoted her as the supreme among the cream of girls, as she screamed
and begged for mercy: and yet.

&nbsp;

�Look at the fuckin� lezzie go eh! All lezzies shud be �ung by their tits till they die.
Still yer couldn�t �ang this �ere lezzie�s slag girlfriend by �er tits, cos she
don�t �ave none!!� the sergeant sneared between
gritted teeth, as she pulled Seraphima up higher by her pubic locks: and yet.

&nbsp;

�This �ere
lezzie�s got fucking tits big as church bells though!�

&nbsp;

��Ere�.! Ere�.!! Hey, grab
an �old of her constable, and let me see if her bells go ding-dong eh!? Fucking
lezzie wiv ding-dong-bells, nar dat ud be summat to write �ome abart wouldn�t
it.�

&nbsp;

Grabbing hold of Seraphima
by her right wrist twisted and hammered hard up her back, and her left wrist at
her side behind her, the dullard Critic grinned
Cheshire cat, watching, as was the terrified Seraphima, the savage sergeant
draw her cosh.

&nbsp;

�Ding fucking lezzie dong!�
the sergeant sneered as she smacked her truncheon down onto Seraphima�s left
nipple, and smashed her gentle breast into her chest, beating the wind out of
the poor negress, who doubled up in an instant, gasping in agony, whilst
incidentally grinding her lovely bare buttocks into the constable�s groin.

&nbsp;

��Ere! You wanna watch it constable! This fucking lezzie is
trying to seduce you!�

&nbsp;

With tears running down her
sweet face and changing course as they met the upper of her succulent soft
lips, Seraphima, the black rose, straightened, only for the sergeant to thrash
her right tit harder still than the left she had just now brutally bruised.

&nbsp;

�Nope! Didn�t �ear no ding or lezzie
fucking dong dat time. Did you constable?�

&nbsp;

�No sarge. No ding or dong
sarge�, Cretina Critic sniggered.

&nbsp;

�Better �it �em a bit �arder
den �adn�t us?� the sergeant spat out with clear glee, before smashing
Seraphima�s left breast so hard, that Seraphima fell to the ground, crying and
begging for mercy.

&nbsp;

�What�s the fucking lezzie
slag saying? �Mercy�? What�s dat?�

&nbsp;

�Nah den. I got it! I reckon dats yer actual French. It means
�yes please� don�t it? What the fucking lezzie slag is saying �ere constable,
is that she wants a truncheon cock up �er, so as to cure �er of being a fucking
lezzie, see!?

&nbsp;

At that, the sergeant
beckoned for the constable to hold Seraphima kneeling, and she slid all twelve
brutal inches of her wooden baton up Seraphima�s cunt, as Seraphima howled and
hollered and bellowed her pain: and yet it slipped in without resistance to its
insistence. And Seraphima knew she was coming: she knew she was on the verge of
a massive cum; but that if she came the Girl-Police would have won this
horrendous game.

&nbsp;

�Dare you is den lezzie.
You�ve bin given de injection, and you ain�t not no
lezzie no more!� the sergeant cruelly laughed.

&nbsp;

As she kneeled on all fours,
they pulled Seraphima up by her pubic hair pigtails once more, till she touched
ground only with her palms. And the intense pain of her stretched sex lips, and
the deep penetration of the truncheon, gave Seraphima a pre-eruption cum. But,
against the exposure of the explosion that her beautiful body was budding and
bidding she endure and enjoy, she still fought and won.

&nbsp;

The police women then
dropped the flawless angel to the filthy floor.

&nbsp;

�Seems to
me constable, as �ow dat gang of girls from the local school, �the Tarts Wiv
�earts Gang� or whatever dey calls demselves, �as bin attacking lezzies
�ereabouts. They owes us a wad of dosh. They �asn�t paid into my charity for
a week or more. Let�s go and report this �ere crime, and put it down to dem,
where it belongs: since they�re all lezzie slags as well!�

�������..

&nbsp;

�I�ll be alright thank you.
You have been very kind.�

&nbsp;

�Let me just turn the shower
on for you then Mrs Ntebeli�.

�������..

&nbsp;

�I think Camilleona has got
a girlfriend�

&nbsp;

No: that wouldn�t do.

&nbsp;

�I think our Camilleona has
got herself a girl�

&nbsp;

Not much better.

&nbsp;

�You�ll have noticed that
Camilleona has gone? I think she�s got a girlfriend�

&nbsp;

If that was the best Marina could come up with, she was never going to get away
with this.

&nbsp;

What was the use of turning
this over and over in her head this way?

&nbsp;

As Marina rose from her bed, her back and buttocks bore bloody
scratches from her long night of passion.

�������..

&nbsp;

As Seraphima lay panting
with pain on the ex butcher�s shop floor, her back bore the bloody scratches
from her fall during her brutal beating.

�������..

&nbsp;

��Ere shall us book this
lezzie for stealing police property?� Sergeant Pat Butt sarcasmed, as she looked
down on the patently passionately perfect Seraphima, gasping with pain, with
her cunt ripped wide by the truncheon deep inside its insides.

&nbsp;

Putting her boot on
Seraphima�s beautiful thigh, she tugged the baton out of the tortured girl. And
Seraphima screamed with the pain again, and rolled on her front on the filthy
floor.

&nbsp;

�Musn�t leave dis in yer,
must us. Yer can get yer own cosh, to continue your cure: lezzie slag!� the
sergeant growled, before she spat on the floor next Seraphima�s face, and then
left her, before trying to slam the old shop�s rickety door as final
punctuation.

�������..

&nbsp;

As the desk clerk put the
key in the door of bedroom 67, and turned it, its lock bore the many scratches
of so much prior usage.

&nbsp;

�I�ll be alright thank you.
You have been very kind.�

&nbsp;

�Let me just turn the shower
on for you then Mrs Ntebeli�

&nbsp;

Alone in the shower
Seraphima sobbed as she came. And her tears poured as she came and sobbed and
cried over and over again.

�������..

&nbsp;

Seraphima sat in her
bathrobe in a chair beside her bed, feeling her bruises, her mind in the
torment of turmoil.

&nbsp;

The bedroom door opened and
a crying blonde angel, accompanied by a clerk, whose face showed she was the
soul of discretion, came hurtling into the room, before kneeling and putting
her sweet head onto Seraphima�s lap.

&nbsp;

The clerk�s face gave an:
�I�ll leave you then� look, as she pocketed her passkey, and turned to let the
two pretty girls comfort each other.

&nbsp;

�Thank you�, Seraphima
called to the clerk.

&nbsp;

�It�s an honour madam�, the
clerk assured, with self-evident sincerity.

&nbsp;

�Where had
you been Seraphima?! You had me
so scared! Oh god don�t ever do that to me again!�
Kate cried as she cried, and as she brought her lovely face, distorted by her
sobbing, up to Seraphima�s, and then hugged the negress
rose as if she would never ever let her go again.

&nbsp;

�I love you�, Kate
whispered.

&nbsp;

�Does Mandy love me too?�
Seraphima answered, trying to bring a lightness to the
scene.

&nbsp;

�I�m being serious�, Kate
answered with her crying giving her voice a distorting croak.

&nbsp;

�I love you too Kate: you
and Mandy both. But I�m a married woman�� Seraphima whispered aloud, wistfully,
as a preliminary to the kisses about to come.

&nbsp;

Thereafter: �What happened
to you my love?� Kate smiled sadly sympathetically.

&nbsp;

�I got beaten up by the
Girl-Police�, Seraphima answered quietly. �It was the two that were here last
night: early this morning that is: the nasty sergeant and her companion in crime�.

&nbsp;

�We�ll damned well report
those evil bitches and now!� Kate bristled.

&nbsp;

�No use. No witnesses. I
heard them say they�d blame it on a local girl-gang�. Let�s go home to Ntobi�,
Seraphima whispered wistfully.

&nbsp;

�Only if you promise to hold
my hand all the way�, Kate demanded and commanded, with her loveliest of so
many lovely smiles.

�������..

&nbsp;

All the
way home Seraphima wracked her mind. She just had to see Kate again. Her life would be incomplete now
without this heavenly honey.

&nbsp;

Marina would have to be told. Marina would just have to be told. Marina would understand. Surely Marina would understand. Marina would just have to understand. 

�������..

&nbsp;

�Hi
Seraphima!� Marina called from the kitchen, as Seraphima graced into
the marital home.

&nbsp;

�Thank god you�re okay my
love�, she added distractedly, but entirely sincerely.

&nbsp;

�I very nearly threw this
away unread. It�s this evening�s paper�� Marina then said, out of the apparent blue.

&nbsp;

�Where�s Camilleona? I�d
like her to do my unpacking�, Seraphima answered, as she struggled with her
suitcase.

&nbsp;

�Oh that�, said Marina, �I�ll tell you in just a mo. But come and look at
this�.

&nbsp;

Seraphima set her case down
and dumped her bag of soiled clothing alongside it. She then tiptoed into the
kitchen in her balletic shoes, to see whatever it was that her wife was going
on about.

&nbsp;

�Oh the
poor girl! Marina opined aloud. �Seraphima you�ve got to read this.
I�m sorry my love. It� It�s terrible news�.

&nbsp;

Seraphima took the crumpled
copy of the �Ntobi Courier� proffered by Marina, who put a comforting arm
around Seraphima, as she pointed out the distant-page news snippet that both
girls now read together.

&nbsp;

�Girl-Court Judge In Guilty Verdict� ran the headline. Seraphima looked
momentarily at Marina, and then read on:-

&nbsp;

�From our London England Correspondent:-

&nbsp;

Deadline Spindon, England: Thursday July 22nd: - Disgraced former
Girl-Court judge, the elegantly beautiful Teasetta Loveschild, begins a
sentence of 12-months hard labour today, after her own court found her guilty
of theft.

&nbsp;

The sentence was handed down
to Loveschild after she admitted stealing a white, robe-style, dressing gown,
during her recent holiday foray into movies, here in Ntobi.

&nbsp;

The robe, the property of
the famous starlet Glorinda Gramoldi, has been returned to its rightful owner.

&nbsp;

A spokesgirl for Ms Gramoldi
said that the rising star was grateful for its return. Adding that Ms Gramoldi
had forgotten she had ever owned it, and assumed it had been lost in her
laundry, along with the soiled panties her many girl fans are so notorious for
stealing.

&nbsp;

Loveschild�s punishment will
begin with one-hundred lashes of the bullwhip, to be administered in public, in
the marketplace of the busy industrial and mining town of Spindon, which is located in the English Midlands.

&nbsp;

The disgraced Loveschild has
been stripped of her judgeship, and her university teaching post. Her academic
qualifications have also been rescinded.

&nbsp;

As Loveschild confessed
under torture, no witnesses needed to be called for the prosecution, thus
saving the English taxpayer much unnecessary expense, and enabling the trial to
be curtailed.

&nbsp;

The Girl-Police officers
engaged on the case in Senabre, were present in court via video-link this afternoon
(UK time), and showed the garment in question.

&nbsp;

�The Courier� understands,
from sources close to the family, that John Loveschild, the guilty woman�s
husband, has insisted that their marriage will be dissolved, concomitantly with
the final stroke of the introductory whipping.

&nbsp;

Loveschild has been refused
permission to appeal against the sentence. Her plea that she had never used,
nor even seen the gown before, and that it was: �just hanging, apparently
forgotten�, in the changing caravan she used during the movie making, was
rejected out of hand, because it contradicted the confession she had had
written for her during her interrogation, and which was provably sealed with
her nipple print.

&nbsp;

In her summing up, the judge
for the case praised the superb work of the Girl-Police,
and two officers of the Ntobi Police Service in particular, for their
indispensable contribution to the detection and resolution of this crime.

&nbsp;

Sergeant Patricia Butt, and
Constable Cretina Critic, of the Ntobi Girl-Police�s Lake Charlotte South
Precinct, the video-link witnesses, were praised by
the judge in court. As a result, both these fine officers will be commended,
and recommended for the Police Medal.

&nbsp;

If she is so awarded, it
will be the third time that Sergeant Butt, known loved and trusted by the Lake
Charlotte community for her gentle but firm ways, and her deep-seated humility,
will have won the Police Medal.�

Seraphima Too

(by Eve Adorer)

&nbsp;

Chapter 6 � Who�ll Duel?

&nbsp;

Not believing what she had
just read, praying what she had read was untrue; it was as if Seraphima did not
even believe the document she held.

&nbsp;

She whisked to the front
page. And there in indisputable indelible print was confirmed:

�The Ntobi Courier and Lake Charlotte News�

Friday July 23rd 2010

�Late Extra Edition�

&nbsp;

As Seraphima looked dazed at
Marina, tears ran down heaven�s faces and wife and wife
must needs embrace with the grace god only gave the female of the human race.

&nbsp;

But, despite their
tenderness, and because of their tenderness, both girls winced. Seraphima from the bruises of her brutal bludgeoning; Marina from
the scratches caused by the consummation of an all-consuming passion.

&nbsp;

�Are you alright my love?� Marina tried to smile.

&nbsp;

�The
Girl-Police beat me up�, Seraphima answered, still sobbing at the thought of
Teasetta�s suffering.

&nbsp;

�Me too�, Marina responded, and thus truly lied to Seraphima for the
first time in their marriage: �The bitches whipped me�, she embellished.

&nbsp;

Seraphima cried for
Teasetta; Marina for Seraphima, and for the knowledge that she had betrayed her
love to the Girl-Police, and in the marital bed. But, after the terrible tune of their sad sobs for a situation they could
do nothing about, the worthlessness of crying dried the tears of both girls. 

&nbsp;

�Where did you say
Camilleona was?� Seraphima enquired again.

&nbsp;

�I sent her away. She had
news that her sister was ill. She�s gone to Enabe for a couple of days. It�s a
wonder you didn�t pass each other at the train station. I know she�s only a
slave, but it seemed inhuman not to let her go. It�s nothing dangerous. Her
sister had to be whipped rather severely. Camilleona has gone to tend her
sister�s wounds. Well, I mean, you couldn�t expect her sister�s owners to do
that, could you?� Marina over-elaborated.

&nbsp;

�I didn�t know Camilleona
had a sister�, Seraphima contemplated out loud.

&nbsp;

�She�s from a big family�, Marina further lied: though that could have been true for
all Marina of Camilleona really knew. �Nicholina: the sister�s name is
Nicholina, or so Camilleona said�, Marina added, to give more credence to the lie, and before
she was asked, and had to struggle to come up with a name.

&nbsp;

The echoing �splaaang� of a
window smashing, preceded that now bumping tumbling sliding and spinning across
the kitchen floor.

&nbsp;

The stun grenade exploded
with an echoing report. After it, Seraphima could see Marina felled to the floor as if she were dead, and could
not hear her own screams.

&nbsp;

It must have been twenty
Girl-Police that followed in, in their gasmasks, wielding bullwhips; and ten of
them that pinned the black rose face down to the floor and sprayed CS gas in
her face.

&nbsp;

�Bring in the cage!� their
leader ordered with a beckoning hand, as the world whirled and Seraphima passed
out.

��������..

&nbsp;

�May it please your honour�,
the clerk of the court began, �The first case before the Ntobi Criminal Court
August 2010 session, is that of Mrs Seraphima Ntbeli.�

&nbsp;

�Ntbeli stands accused of
receiving stolen property: to wit one white robe styled in the familiar form of
a dressing gown, and of assaulting two Girl-Police officers with one of their
own batons. This latter took place on the next day following their interviewing
her in respect of the said illegal receipt, and therefore in the normal pursuit
of their duty�.

&nbsp;

�Unveil the prisoner�, the
judge ordered.

&nbsp;

�May it please your honour,
the prisoner is self-evidently a very violent girl, and it has been thought
best to keep her in what is commonly called a �lioness� cage�; and to keep the
cage covered�, the clerk informed, with an edge of anxiety to her voice.

&nbsp;

�I thank the pretty clerk
for her advice. Nonetheless, I would remind the clerk that this is my court,
and when I say �unveil the prisoner�, the prisoner will be unveiled�, the judge
quietly insisted.

&nbsp;

As the cover of Seraphima�s
sheet-steel-floored iron barred cage was whisked away, a gasp echoed from the
courtroom walls.

&nbsp;

Within her brutal cage up
high on a stand, Seraphima knelt with her wrists girlackled behind her back, and her ankles girlackled together.

&nbsp;

Her neck had an iron ring
around it, and the ring was chained to the top of the cage. To tame her, she
had rusting iron rods thrusting into her trussed body, holding her rigidly
immoveable. The rods penetrated her throat, her cunt, and her anus.

&nbsp;

Only god and Seraphima knew
how long she had dwelt starving in the cage in which she could not move save
for infinitesimally. And god was not saying, and
Seraphima could not do more than moan her deep distress.

&nbsp;

Though god may not have
borne witness, one of her angels saw this terrible cruelty, and screamed out:
�Oh Seraphima!!� as she sobbed.

&nbsp;

Seraphima�s eyes looked
around the court and saw lovely Kate in tears, and Marina and Camilleona
holding hands, with Camilleona leaning on Marina�s shoulder with the look of love in her eyes.

&nbsp;

�Before I declare her
guilty, does the prisoner have a defence?� the judge enquired routinely.

&nbsp;

The eyes of the court, and those of Seraphima looked around to see if anyone
would speak for her: Seraphima�s eyes in desperation.

&nbsp;

The click-clack of
twelve-inch stilettos, with steel heels tapering to pinpoints, was the answer,
as an angelic apparition, wearing a black PVC microdress, with her simply
sinfully black rubber suspenders showing below its hemline, holding transparent
latex stockings on her very shapely legs, wiggled into the court, and took the
witness stand.

&nbsp;

The little angel, no more
than five-three in her stockinged feet, had cropped hair that waved like shorn
corn, as she daintied her delight onto the stand.

&nbsp;

�And who would you be,
delightful little lady?� the judge empathised, as she ogled the angel�s shapely
thighs.

&nbsp;

�I have the honour of being
Professor Kate I. S. Godsgift of the University of Ntobi, your honour�, Kate
curtsied, her skirt promising to show she wore no panties; but,
contradictatorially, falling as short of honouring that offer as its hem was in
distance down Kate�s lovely thighs.

&nbsp;

�I also have the honour of
being in love with the girl in that horrible cage�, Kate affirmed for Seraphima
to hear, only just avoiding more tears as she looked over at her.

&nbsp;

At that affirmation, a
single gasp of astonishment caused the assembled girls and women to turn in
turn to stare at Marina, who stared astonished at Kate and Seraphima by
turn.

&nbsp;

�Compose yourself lovely
girl, and tell this court what you have to say in defence of the prisoner�, the
judge instructed. �And I will have no more interruptions from the public
gallery!� she ordered, looking around slowly; sternly.

&nbsp;

In the southern-hemisphere
winter, the bitter winds that blew in the D�colletage Mountains above Lake Charlotte, were in sharp contrast with the coolest
low-seventies or late sixties Fahrenheit, the lowlands of Senabre ever
encountered at July�s worst.

&nbsp;

The film to be made of
Seraphima�s punishment would repay the cost of her trial. Glorinda Gramoldi had
been engaged to don her leathers, in �The Spillage�, a film that would witness
the punishment of a girl actually found guilty of receiving stolen goods, but
on a more imaginative fictional charge.

��������..

&nbsp;

The careers of Sergeant Pat
Butt, and Constable Cretina Critic, of the Ntobi Girl-Police were over.

&nbsp;

The exposition by sweet Kate
Godsgift, supported by the secret filming of the two, now disgraced officers,
attempting to bribe the �Tarts With Hearts Gang�, and threatening them with
prosecution for beating-up Seraphima if they refused to pay, had tipped the
balance.

&nbsp;

Kate knew nothing of the
accusation of receiving stolen goods, or who on earth �Teasetta Loveschild�
was.

&nbsp;

Seraphima had been reprieved
and sentenced at one and the same time.

&nbsp;

She was no longer charged
with assaulting the Girl-Police in Enabe, but found guilty of receiving stolen
goods: the �goods� being the same dressing gown for which Teasetta Loveschild
was still recovering from one-hundred lashes of the bullwhip, as her
preliminary punishment for the original theft.

&nbsp;

Pat Butt and Cretina Critic
had been lucky to find themselves roles as extras in the film.

��������..

&nbsp;

Seraphima knew what was to
come. Her stomach churned with fear in consequence of the consequences of her
crime, and the subsequent sequence of events that led to her being dressed
before the cameras for her upcoming ordeal.

&nbsp;

To ensure her co-operation,
she had been given the choice of one-month�s continued imprisonment in the
iron-barred cage in which she had been carried to court, or to take willing
unwilling part in the film.

��������..

&nbsp;

The �highest house in the
land� was meant as a meaningful double-meaning. Well above the mountain
snowline, the former hunting lodge of the very much former queens of Senabre,
the last of whose line had long since been deposed by the British, was palatial
in parlance and indeed. Its location atop Mount D�colletage�s snowline, gave it physical height, to match the
hype attendant upon its depiction as high in importance; which it had never in
fact been.

��������..

&nbsp;

The steady intermittent
soporific crackle from the logs on the fire and the sweet smell of their pine,
as they pined opinion on the stunning naked girl being
dressed before the glowing hearth, filled the microphones.

&nbsp;

In the synopsis for the
film, Seraphima was a serving wench who had accidentally spilt a droplet of
wine on the dining table of the cruel Czarina. No more beautiful woman could be
found to play the Czarina than the statuesque Gramoldi. 

&nbsp;

As the six-foot-two tall,
not too tall at all, athletic blonde bombshell, unrolled
lightening-bright-white seamed nylon stockings up the long curvaceous expanse
of Seraphima�s seemingly never-ending legs, the glow in Glorinda Gramoldi�s
honey-coloured eyes, showed the state of her arousal, not least when her hands
reached the place of Seraphima�s espousal, exposed.

&nbsp;

The waspie Seraphima already
wore, to draw her into an hourglass with the minim of grasp that her gracious
figure needed to complete that task, dandled suspenders at the sides of her
bountiful bottom.

&nbsp;

A theme for the dream that
was the circumstance unfolding before the cameras, showed in the lining of the
waspie the negress rosebud wore. Her waist was
squeezed whisper slim wisp, by a waspie, lined inside and out with warm white
wolf-fur, the outer hairs of which drifted in the eddies
from the currents of warm air from the glowing crackling fire.

&nbsp;

As she saw that Glorinda was
eyeing the glory of her god-given mouth, closed and composed in the �O� that
proposed orgasm as the road she who touched the black rose must always
eventually expose, Seraphima lowered her lovely dark-devil-brown eyes in
shyness and shame.

&nbsp;

Glorinda fastened the clasps
of the two suspenders now, so that they no longer dawdled in dangle at the
sides of Seraphima�s thighs, but took the strain of the sweet refrain any
stocking that captured the rhapsodies of Seraphima�s legs, must sing, with
metaphor to the fore, for her two so shapely limbs.

&nbsp;

Save where now pulled up at
her flanks into stretched inverted-vees, Seraphima�s stocking tops diagonalled
the glory of her sizzling thighs, their pristine white contrasting with her
sweet liquorice black.

&nbsp;

As Glorinda now finalised
the weaving of Seraphima�s six-foot long pubic hair into twin corn-ear tresses,
Seraphima watched with her lovely lips slightly agape, making a kiss with no
mistake.

&nbsp;

As she wrapped the corn-ears
of Seraphima�s pubic tresses, to address and caress the negress
angel�s stupendous thighs, Glorinda�s sighs were the genuine article.

&nbsp;

The corn-weaves of
Seraphima�s astounding pubic hair, paid honour to the wonder size of her wonderful
thighs, around which they were wrapped in rapture, to capture the beauty of her
legs; not by playing garters, this time at least, put in forming themselves as
infamous snakes, that were tied in inspirational spirals, curling curving
swerving around the rosebud�s thighs, down from her stocking tops to just above
her knees, whereat they were tied off to themselves.

&nbsp;

Just as with the waspie, the
rabbit-skin panties were white-fur lined, inside and out.

&nbsp;

The sensuous warmth of her
fluffy-fur knickers aroused fair Seraphima to a blush hidden by the glory of
her black complexion.

&nbsp;

In wholly innocence,
Seraphima�s orgasmic �O� mouth stood a little wider now, for she knew from the
feel of openness, that her pubic hair had been pulled hard, before being wound
round her thighs and tied: for her love lips stood agape inside her hot white
rabbit-fur knickers insides.

&nbsp;

Even with her legs together,
within her fur panties she was smiling pink. The discomfort of this disport
from the distancing of her distinctly feminine distinctions, reminded her that
she was a girl.

&nbsp;

The elasticated garter
slowly drawn up the glory of Seraphima�s left leg, was
the one exception to the wonderful white in which her beautiful black was being
enmirrored. For the fur of this superfluous erotic garter was white ermine
dotted with black. The two-inch depth of the ermine-fur garter delighted
Seraphima�s left thigh at the top of her stocking: warming bare thigh on the
inside of her leg, and decorating the stocking�s vee, just below the suspender
clasp on her outer thigh.

&nbsp;

The well-concealed zips,
made it easier to clasp the curves of Seraphima�s calves in the white
wolf-fur-lined knee-high heelless tiptoe-topping ballet-en-pointe boots, that
Glorinda next put on Seraphima, who, to aid the course of this course, was
sitting her parable of incomparable curves, in an essay of inestimable beauty,
on a seat made a throne as she did so.

&nbsp;

In bidding she now stand
after putting the boots on, the �Czarina� could not help but put out a helping
hand, and was thus touched and touched, hand and heart in equal part, by the
lovely Seraphima.

&nbsp;

Standing en-pointe only on
the squared-off toes of her boots, Seraphima teetered with her legs drawn into
a damnation of instructive inductive seductive muscular tensions, conducive
only to paying and praying worshipful attention to.

&nbsp;

The coat was fabulous. It
had once gloried in covering two polar bears. Now its sensationally sensuous
warmth embraced a near bare girl.

&nbsp;

Double-breasted, like its
wearer, and double furred, like its wearer, inside and outside fur-lined in
pristine white, she brown-furred, head and somewhere else that can be easily
inferred, it covered sweet Seraphima from where its collar-wings triangled out
at her face�s cheeks, to her fur booted ankles.

&nbsp;

Hooks went into eyes, and
Glorinda was espied by the cameras, as she slipped the gold buttons into their
allocated allotted eyes, watched by Seraphima�s own glorious globes.

&nbsp;

Before she slipped the white
chinchilla-fur hat onto Seraphima�s head, and lowered it flaps over her pretty
little ears, Glorinda eased Seraphima�s conspicuously cute dark brown hair
curls out from the coats collar.

&nbsp;

The mittens were of white
rabbit-fur. The stole had once been an artic fox.

&nbsp;

Enraptured and captured and
captivating in her furs, Seraphima felt guilty for the sensationally sexy
warmth and wonderful sensuousness.

&nbsp;

As she slid her
mitten-gloved hands into a white wild-hare-fur muff: her hands in a fur muff,
her muff in fur knickers, her bare nipples were
excited by the fur of the insides of her clinging coat.

&nbsp;

As she wiggled on tiptoe at
the order of the �Czarina� in the film being made, Seraphima knew the pull on
her female denoting keynote lips, from her tethered pubic hair, and felt that
this was just just punishment for the suffering of the poor animals that had
been sacrificed to cover this vulnerable human naked-ape, from exposure to the
bitter cold of the outside mountain air.

��������..

&nbsp;

The Czarina wrapped in red
fur and leather, and her helpers clad in black fur, ordered Seraphima away from
the warmth of the fire and out onto the plateau on which the winter palace
stood.

&nbsp;

Outside Seraphima�s
tiptoe-topped-feet scrunched in the compacted snow, and her breath steamed in a
sweet stream from her daintily flared nostrils.

&nbsp;

It was minus-five
Fahrenheit, with a chilling breeze telling the thermometer it was minus-ten.
The same chilling breeze blew up a scurry of soft white snowflakes that kissed
Seraphima�s lovely negress black face.

&nbsp;

What happened next was not
in the script. But Seraphima took just one look at the delightful horse that
was to pull the sled on which the party outside were about to ride, when she
squealed with delight and wiggled over, her breasts swinging a fandango on her
chest, with her nipples hotly in the caress of the fur insides of her coat: and
removed her stole from in front of her black-girl�s orgasmic mouth, and took
her mitten-clad right hand out of her muff, and with her opened-to-pink muff
still hot in her rabbit-fur panties, kissed the lucky horse, and smothered its
nose with her sweet gentle girly love.

��������..

&nbsp;

Seraphima, the prisoner, the
naughty maid who had spilled the fictitious wine, returned her stole across her
hot kiss-me-I-am-kismet lips, and put her mitten-gloved hand back in her muff,
as she was led to the rear of the sled and made as bade, to sit her other
fur-clad, parted-to-show-pink muff, on the rear seat where the Czarina would
sit beside her.

&nbsp;

It was the servant played by
ex-police-sergeant Pat Butt, who placed the bearskin rug over Seraphima�s lap
in readiness for the sled to become pony and trap.

&nbsp;

As she sat glowing in the
wonderful warmth of her furs, Seraphima felt comfortable and almost comforted
in the biting frostbitten air.

&nbsp;

It was the Czarina who now
reached to Seraphima�s chest, and tugged on fur-hidden, hitherto secret zips.
And then reached inside the close-clinging coat, to grasp in turn, each of
Seraphima�s breasts, and haul their black-coffee beauty out into the bitter
biting air, completely bare, adjusting the outside zips under them to hold them
exposed there.

&nbsp;

At this unexpected exposure of her lovely black bosom to the
bitter frost�s bite, even as her unction spread its musk from her held-open
lips in her rabbit-fur knickers, shamed, and realising she was there to be thus
punished, Seraphima hung her lovely head, wondering why her body betrayed her
instead, despite that she fought her arousal inside her pretty head.

��������..

&nbsp;

Momentous moments later, and rhythmic onomatopoeic
tintinnabulations: unconstrained sleigh bells on reined reins. The sleigh
glided, scrunching rolling marbles of uncompacted snow. The glides slid. Days of long nights.

&nbsp;

A bare black bosom openly fully exposed to the chilling
cold, jumped and swung in twin unison with the equine footfall. Horse four
foot: swift. Snow four-foot: drifts. She forfeit: sits. Days
when frost bites.

&nbsp;

Steam? No. Vapour? Yes. Breath? Again yes. Nostrils flare. Equine
and sweet fair. Bitter air. Days
when wolves fight.

&nbsp;

�Snow White�? No. No fairytale. Snow white? Yes: blue white. She white?
No negress. Days when howls fright.

&nbsp;

Dressed white? Yes. Hat with ear-flaps down; stole around
neck; knee-boots; ankle-length coat; knees under bearskin rug; seamed white
nylon stockings; ermine garter: left thigh. Mittened hands within hare-fur
muff. Split-open pink-flashing hot muff within rabbit-fur
panties. Nights of owl flight.

&nbsp;

She looks forward four ways. Quick glance eyes not believed.
Not four eyes looking horizonward? Four brown eyes staring at
starkly crisp world? Surely not so? Two brown
eyes steal out from under fur hat and over her fur stole. Yet two more �eyes�
also stare where the distance is at. Her nipples protrude; her breasts are
nude, and bitten by the freezing frost.

��������..

&nbsp;

So many of the pines had
been hacked for fire logs, that it was a wonder that the stark upright bare
trunk on the snowy plateau had originated from trees at the lower line of the
ex-volcanoes steep sides. The purpose behind, one-hundred years since, making
ten poor girls haul it up the mountain track, under the lash, to its current
station, where it had been erected upright in the permanent ice, was soon to
become self evident.

��������..

&nbsp;

The Czarina held her gloved
hand up, and ex-sergeant Butt slid the bearskin fur off Seraphima�s lap, and
the lovely negress, her bare breasts cruelly cold bold
protuberances as she daintied, alighted her delight onto her tiptoes in the
clinging chill of the mountain air.

&nbsp;

�You will strip yourself completely
bare�, the Czarina bade and poor Seraphima must obey.

&nbsp;

�I will not have clumsy
servants in my employ. You will strip yourself naked for us to enjoy�, Glorinda
gloried, as she rolled the words of her role into the steaming vapour that
uttered with her utterances to the entrancing negress.

&nbsp;

Seraphima knew the brutality
of this order from the test that her bare chest had already given the vicious
cold. Yet she knew she must obey or be returned to the iron bars of the
three-thrust cage, in which she had been imprisoned when accused of assaulting
the Girl-Police.

&nbsp;

As she unwrapped her arctic
fox stole and handed it to Cretina Critic, Seraphima�s hands shook with her
terror. She had already handed over the muff, and now removed her mitten
gloves. The glory of her black beauty began to tell its story in the
contrasting white of the snowline�s bite.

&nbsp;

At the removal of her hat,
the torment in the poor negress� wonderfully warm eyes
showed despite her fight to make it not so.

&nbsp;

Reaching up her coat,
Seraphima eased down her rabbit-fur-knickers still hot from her humid body and
sweet with a slick of her Aroma-Arabic�s scent, from her ascent to enjoyment of
her humiliation, despite that she was so ashamed that her body betrayed her so,
before they had bared her tits to the torment of the cold, to cool the ardour
in the pink of her harbour.

&nbsp;

As she leaned down to unzip
her right boot, Seraphima�s tits rolled round to swing in gravity�s gentle cling,
to make belle bells knelling that she was heaven.

&nbsp;

The coat must now go, and
Seraphima must now know how horrible it was undoubtedly about to be there, to
be in the frosty air bare.

&nbsp;

As she undid the gold
buttons and unhooked the gold hooks from their gold eyes, Seraphima felt the
inrush of the cruelly cold air, to the comparatively thin lair of clothing she
did still wear.

&nbsp;

Even as she removed her
coat, she hugged it to her already shivering body to try and soak in the last
vestiges of its comforting warmth, as she stood in her skimpy last vestments,
but the unchivalrous ex-Girl-Police, tore it from her gentle grasp, and left
her with nothing to clasp, as her body began to twitch and goose-pimple in the
murderous cold.

&nbsp;

Seraphima�s lovely eyes
looked for mercy and saw only lascivious lasers lusting after her lovely body,
as the Czarina ordered her to continue to strip.

&nbsp;

With her impractically but
prettily long fingernails, Seraphima struggled to untie her pubic hair from
where it played double-asp to her Cleopatra, spiralling around her
inspirational thighs, because her hands were made clumsy by the fact she was
now one whole shiver.

&nbsp;

As she fought to unclasp her
suspenders and lift her ermine garter so that her thin stockings slowly slid
down her superbly smooth legs, the struggle was worse still.

&nbsp;

The laces of the waspie were
all but impossible for fingertips that could no longer, she felt, feel. And yet
she obeyed and opened it wide to let the bitter cold inside, and her body St
Vitas dance with the cold�s inexorable advance.

&nbsp;

To be made to bare her feet
in the snow was surely more than Seraphima could bear, and yet she did as she
was ordered, and eased off her boots and stockings, till her beautiful black
body was bare, completely and utterly bare, bar the ermine garter on her left
thigh, which she moved to remove to get herself totally obediently nude.

&nbsp;

�You may leave the garter. I
don�t want you to die of the cold�, the Czarina cruelly mocked.

&nbsp;

As the breeze blew to freeze
the naked Seraphima�s passionate veins with its freezing kiss, she danced with
her arms around her chest and her lovely legs wrapped tight around each other
as if she would squeeze the remaining warmth in the depths of her sweet body
out to her beautiful black soft smooth carapace.

&nbsp;

�You will stay naked for one
hour. For you to stay alive for that endless time, you will find it best by far
to keep moving. To keep your mind and body sound, you will need to keep warm.
And the best and only way for you to keep warm, will be for you to masturbate.
But I do not allow my maids to masturbate. So if we see you
exciting your lovely body, you will be whipped�, the Czarina announced.

&nbsp;

�Oh god! Please have mercy on me!!� Seraphima begged.

&nbsp;

The tails of three
white-leather bullwhips trailed in the snow. Each bullwhip was laced with a
half-dozen razor blades embedded in its knot-weighted tip. As the Czarina
cracked her whip to show she meant what she had said, the blades sliced the
ice, and only god knew what they could do to Seraphima�s sweet flesh.

&nbsp;

Her feet already numb,
Seraphima danced, as her teeth chattered uncontrollably in her head. And
despite that she knew what it would bring, she dived
for the warmth of the clothing on the sled, tripped on her pubic hair pigtail
and slid-fell in the snow.

&nbsp;

And the ex-sergeant�s whip
whistled brutally, and gave her a blow, that caused her to scream as a stream
of her blood flowed from the cuts in her sweet arm, as the whip did its harm,
and the poor angel knew she must suffer anew, if she did not get more warmth
than her mean menial garter knew.

&nbsp;

As she squatted, sobbing in
her pain, Seraphima was one long shiver in the bitter bite of the wind that
blew on her naked limbs. And now she caressed her arms to try and give them
warmth. And next she ran her dainty frozen hands down her handsome squatted
thighs.

&nbsp;

But, as she caressed her
chilled breasts, the Czarina decided she was masturbating, and a white-snake
whip whistled, and Seraphima screamed as it wrapped
rapidly around her squatted body, and it razor-edges-embedded-tip, the skin of
her beautiful bum ripped, so scarlet on the white snow now slowly dripped.

&nbsp;

Seraphima now begged and
begged for mercy. She knew she had to masturbate in order to stay alive. And
she knew all to true that if she did so the whips would flay her.

&nbsp;

Her begging was
indecipherable. Her constant shiver in the bitter cold made it impossible for
her to unlock her jaw. Her pretty hand reached down between her heavenly legs.
She knew she must masturbate before it was too late. She whisked her love lips
with the frisk of her hand threshing them and thrashing them to bring on the
glow that a girl knows when her heat rises with her arousals arrival. And the
slash of the whips on her bare back raised a livid welts
that flowed a crimson river, and still Seraphima fingered her quiver to stop
the endless shiver.

&nbsp;

And she toyed with her clit
as the whip split her thigh, and her blood spilt to the ground nigh. And she
rubbed her tits on her thighs to keep her nipples alive. And the whip sliced
her back across her shoulder blades. And Seraphima came. But she needed this
again, and again, for the only way for her not to die in the cold savage snow,
was for her to masturbate to make herself glow.

&nbsp;

And so she played loves tune
on the most sensitive instrument known to girlkind, strumming her lips like a
lyre, as her back was flogged to add fire to the spice she must work from her
cunt, if she was to stay alive in the cold blunt, as a snow scurry increased
her hurry, and she masturbated herself to a gain, of coming yet again.

&nbsp;

And then she continued to
play her frozen fingers in linger over the lips of her sex, and to rub hard on
her nub and to poke in her hole to stoke the fires her strokes must inspire, if
she was not to expire. And the whips took her thighs, and cut them as she cried
with the horror of the pain, but still masturbated over and over again, to keep
alive her lovely flame.

&nbsp;

Strumming guitar on the
strings made by her love lips, Seraphima�s tune was crescendo ascending the
highway to heaven, as she masturbated as she must to survive in the brutally
bitter cold and deep dire frost, that bit every millimetre�s millimetre of her
naked flesh, as the pain of the marrow chilling cold, told its toll in her
unstoppable shivers, and the quivers of her breasts, as she threshed her love
lips with fresh zest, to save her poor life in the cold strife, of her naked
nudeness, bar the cynical cruelty of her single ermine garter on her superb
left thigh: a black beauty like a shadow in the snow�s drive, as they whipped
her with the razor loaded white leather bullwhips, to punish her for
masturbating, even while she masturbated furiously, in order to stay alive.

&nbsp;

�Stop this filthy whore
masturbating!� the cruel Czarina charged.

&nbsp;

And Seraphima screamed as
she was seized my her pubic tresses and dragged across the snow, a slithering
black honey, swishing and switching bewitchingly side to side as she was slid
in the snow, so cold on her naked body, despite her eager endless masturbation
to keep the fires of her human spirit from flickering out in the bitter winter
cold.

&nbsp;

And her breasts were pressed
out at her sides of her trunk as they dragged her on her front, like a foul
drunk, by the hair of her cunt. And she struggled and failed to prevail with
her hands and lost, to stop herself being hauled through the snow to the wooden
post.

&nbsp;

Dragging Seraphima to her
frozen feet with the hair of her head, she saw with horror the holes in the
side of the post and the height at which they were fed. This was not in the
script and no compare with the bars of the iron tricorn cage instead!

&nbsp;

�Mercy!� she screamed. �Oh
please god mercy�.

&nbsp;

But they hauled her to her
feet and then the tips of her toes. Then they tied her to the post with the
pubic hair of this rose. Then they drove in a nail so as to keep her pubically
publicly arranged, so that the rosebud would stand gibbering shivering on
tiptoes arraigned.

&nbsp;

But Seraphima�s eyes were on
the horror of the holes at each side of the post, and she knew what was coming
to hurt her the most.

&nbsp;

And they tied her wrists
above her head, and flogged her bare back until it bled. And the red ran over
the bum of the rose, and dripped to make pink the surrounding snows, as the
whips in the same snows slithered, before they swished through the rare air and
brutality delivered, on the sweet soft skin of the naked frozen negress, each
stroke a step in the progress toward when she heard the horror of the clink of
hammer and nails. And to the wooden upright her tits they impaled. And she
screamed in her pain and horror, as they smashed the nails through the sides of
her tits with a hammer, and sexually crucified the black angel to complete her
fate, as her punishment for letting herself masturbate.

&nbsp;

As Seraphima shivered and
shuddered nailed to the post by her tits, they did not neglect the hits with
the whips. And they flogged the poor rosebud to keep her alive, for the bite of
the cold was to the core of her inside, for she had been naked in the snow for
over an hour, and still they whipped the lovely black flower, and the whips
tails trailed in cold pink snow, where Seraphima�s blood had been mixed to make
it so, and her back was flogged to poor bloody ribbons. And she cried on the
post to which she was nailed by her tits, as they flogged her to punish her for
rubbing her nub, and her cries were not of pain but of gain, as she came with
cum on cum again and again, and the core of the poor angel was cold to the
quick, as her naked body in the snow was still whipped as down the post a trail
snailed. And her proboscis clitoris uncurled and rubbed on the equally upright,
to which she was nailed.

&nbsp;

And the last cry she uttered
was from the uttermost of cums, as she slumped in her bonds overcome with pain
and joy, as her punishers their whips continued to employ, on her thighs as she
sighed at the thunderstorm inside her honeypot. As down the post she slipped,
and her tits were ripped on the nails, as she slumped in a faint, overcome by
her cums, and her breasts took her weight, as she moaned with pleasure, as the
nails through her tits proved inadequate measure.

&nbsp;

The final scene of the film
showed Seraphima in slumber, her body bleeding from stripes without number.
Lost to the cruel cold world in which she had been refrigerated, as her lovely
body with the razor whips was serrated, her tits nailed to the upright because
she had masturbated.

&nbsp;

As another white flurry of
snow blew over her naked black body, Seraphima stirred and smiled with her deep
down pleasure, as she hung from her tits nailed, with her cums echoing off the
Richter Scales. As the camera showed the pink of the snow below her body, and
the slick of her honey on the post to which she was nailed, naked in the snow,
but for the one mocking garment she had been left to wear on a left thigh
without pareil. The single garment on her totally naked body.
The garment that glowed in the snows increasing flurry.
The garter of soft warming ermine that crowned her glorious
thigh.

&nbsp;

The �clip� �clop� �clip�
�clop� of the ponygirls� hooves took Marina to the door once more. Monday was delivery day. She
was anxious. The package was overdue. She had neglected her boat business
especially to be home to receive it.

&nbsp;

The two ponygirls pulling
the trash cart were eased to a halt outside Marina�s home. The driver and her assistant stepped down.

&nbsp;

Marina rushed out to the road. For the third time that
morn, her twelve-inch heeled mules scrunching in the gravel of the drive, as
her lovely legs flew.

&nbsp;

�Good mornin� darlin�!� the
cheerful driver called, as the breathless, breathtaking, Marina approached.

&nbsp;

�You Mrs
Jonson?�

&nbsp;

�No. No. Ntbeli.
The name is Ntbeli�, Marina responded, anxiety uppermost in her tone.

&nbsp;

�Oh. Oh dear. Not sure we�ve
got one for an Ntbeli� the driver mused resignedly.

&nbsp;

��Ere Jo, tek a look at that
one at the back will yer�, she then commanded to her lovely assistant, who now
climbed onto the cart.

&nbsp;

�Sorry �bout dis luv.
They�ve really fucked it up today, if you�ll pardon my language. List and load labels is sposed to fuckin� match ain�t dey.
At least yer�d fuckin� think so, wunt yer?� the driver mused in her amused
mocking tone. 

&nbsp;

��Ere den. You�re a crackin� little darlin� ain�t yer�, the
driver continued, as her eyes mentally undressed Marina, and metaphorically caressed her shapely legs. �Now
den sweet�art; you don�t �ave to �ave lonely nights when Nina�s around. Dey don�t call me �love potion number Nina� for nuffink
doll: that I can promise yer. Just give me de word luv, and I�ll give yer
doorbell de old ring-a-ding-ding-fing, any time! Be a pleasure for a sweet
little doll like you�.�

&nbsp;

�Yea! �Ere's an Ntbeli� the assistant now called,
distracting the amorously inclined driver�s attention from ogling the
discomforted Marina�s lovely thighs.

&nbsp;

And, as if she had entirely
forgotten that she had just been attempting to date the gorgeous Marina, the driver said: �Looks like yer in luck arter all
den sweetheart. Where d�yer wannit dumped?�

������.

&nbsp;

The driver and assistant
having just gone, Marina and Camilleona removed the hood and untied the gag.
With scissors they cut the long jute bag. Slowly the filthy bloody body of the
barely alive Seraphima was revealed.

&nbsp;

After Marina had put the scissors aside, she reached for them
again, and snipped through, and cast aside, a blood-soaked fur garter she had
just spotted: a garter that for some reason had been left on Seraphima�s left
thigh.

&nbsp;

Camilleona had already
lowered her top and now knelt and proffered her right breast to Seraphima, who
suckled eagerly.

&nbsp;

�We can wash her down right
here. Then we need to take turns to lie with her, to get her body warm. I�ll
take first turn�, Marina announced as she began to undress, thereby merely
confirming what she had already planned.

&nbsp;

After Seraphima had been
bathed clean, Marina stripped herself finally naked, lay on the chaise
beside her, and then hugged her wife to her warm body, as Camilleona slid an
eiderdown duvet over the two stunning negresses.

&nbsp;

�Come back in an hour please
Camilleona. And we�ll see if she wants the tit again�, Marina concluded.

������.

&nbsp;

For all Seraphima herself
knew, it might have been days weeks or months that she lay there, or later in
her bed instead.

&nbsp;

Her recovery was slow but
certain. Her mind was lost for a long while. For that same long while, she was
sure there was an angel reading by her bed. A little blonde girl with lovely
grey eyes would read to her.

&nbsp;

But the comfort Seraphima
took from these visits, was as much from the view up
the angel�s skirt exquisite. For there indeed were the gates of heaven, pure,
and innocent, and hairless: tiny and tight and shaped like a keyhole. The
little girl seemed careless of what she was showing, but, when realising, then
blushed scarlet, before playing lovely harlot, and letting Seraphima continue
to see her love mouth.

������.

&nbsp;

Kate was now a regular
visitor to the Ntbeli household. Despite that Marina knew she was a rival for Seraphima�s affections, the
shear delightfulness of the charming Kate won Marina over, and the two main women in Seraphima�s life,
had become good friends with one another.

������.

&nbsp;

It had come as no shock to
Seraphima when Marina had told her that she wanted a divorce.

&nbsp;

Over the year that had
passed, whilst she had recovered, and got back to full fitness by running and
swimming, she had been no slouch in noticing how Marina and Camilleona held
hands, when they thought she was not looking.

&nbsp;

And that fact in turn had
come as no surprise, when Seraphima fitted those scenes in with her recall of
the two sat together at her trial, and the look of
love in Camilleona�s eyes then.

&nbsp;

As Seraphima sat in a
deckchair beside the swimming pool, pretty Kate kissed her bare thigh.

&nbsp;

�Do you want me to promise
to obey if we get married?� she asked.

&nbsp;

Seraphima took the angel�s
chin in her hand, and ran her thumb over Kate�s ever-moist lips.

&nbsp;

�There are things you need
to know about me�, Kate whispered intensely.

������.

&nbsp;

The click of Camilleona�s
high heels broke the spell.

&nbsp;

�Camilleona bring her wine
all chilled for her two lovely friends�, the eponymous Italian sweetly
announced.

&nbsp;

�We soon need new servant. Me and Miss Marina go London and married. Camilleona so excited!� the lovely
Camilleona enthused.

&nbsp;

Seraphima beckoned her to
take a seat. Camilleona was no longer a slave or servant now,
she was part of the household on equal terms, along with Marina and Kate. Of
course counting Seraphima herself, the �Ntbeli household� was become, and was
agreed should stay and be, a four girl institution.

������.

&nbsp;

Camilleona
gone, Seraphima turned to lovely Kate once more.

&nbsp;

�Do you think we should have
a trial marriage whilst Marina and Camilleona are away?� Kate blushed, as she
tried not to let her lovely shyness show in her adorable face.

&nbsp;

�What were those secrets?�
Seraphima gently enquired.

&nbsp;

�What secrets?� Kate teased.

&nbsp;

Seraphima brushed her long
fingers longingly down Kate�s soft cheek.

&nbsp;

�I�m a virgin�, Kate
blushed.

&nbsp;

Seraphima clasped Kate�s
hands in two gentle hands of her own, and longed to kiss her.

&nbsp;

�I�ve never had periods�� I
don�t have monthlies��� I�ve not gone through puberty��. I�m not a woman��. I�m
still only a girl��.but I�m a woman in every other way�, Kate whispered, with
fear in her lovely grey eyes, those eyes looking for the rejection she was
terrified she was about to incur.

&nbsp;

Seraphima looked at the
angel, and raised Kate�s now slumped forward head with a hand under her chin.

&nbsp;

�Will: �I love you�, and:
�Will you marry me sweet adorable Kate?�, do as
answers?� Seraphima whispered intensely.

&nbsp;

The two girls now kissed to
bliss, as blessed as two humans can be, till heaven relocates to earth: two
compassionate coins of inestimable worth.

&nbsp;

As the two lovers now sat, with
Kate on Seraphima�s lap, Kate leaned her head on Seraphima�s breast and
whispered, with mischievous minx in her golden giggle: �I can also be very
naughty. You may have to spank me!�

������.

&nbsp;

As Seraphima rose from the
bed, before covering the still sleeping Kate with the duvet, and taking herself
to the shower, she put the tumbled Mandy off the floor, and put her back into
Kate�s sweet arms.

&nbsp;

Without opening her eyes
Kate took the teddybear and held it innocently, continuing all this while a
sleeping angel.

������.

&nbsp;

A month was a goodly time
for a honeymoon. But then, if you were to travel as far as London, a month was surely needed.

&nbsp;

For Marina and the newly
minted Mrs Camilleona Ntbeli, the honeymoon was over, and their flight would
touch down at �Ntobi International� later that day.

&nbsp;

At the call from below of:
�Cooee! Seraphima! Are you up and about sweetheart?� Seraphima switched off the
shower and, dripping wet still, dashed to put on her towelling robe, before
rushing to the stairs.

&nbsp;

�Oh god Marina, you gave me
a shock!� she cried as she rushed to kiss her ex-wife, and her ex-wife�s new
wife.

&nbsp;

�You�re not due here for two
hours yet�, she gabbled.

&nbsp;

�Sorry sweetheart. We got an
earlier flight. Oh, and a following wind. Where�s Kate? I�ve got a surprise for
you two. Where�s Kate?� Marina
repeated.

&nbsp;

�Still
sleeping. What�s the surprise?�
Seraphima asked with kittenish curiosity to the fore.

&nbsp;

�It would hardly be a
surprise if I were to tell you�; Marina smiled, just as Marina always but always smiled.

&nbsp;

�It�s my wedding present for
you and Kate, if you must know�, Marina teased.

&nbsp;

�Do you want to get Kate
downstairs or shall I show her later?� she then enquired.

&nbsp;

�I can�t wait for later!�
Seraphima exclaimed.

&nbsp;

�Okay then. But you must
close your eyes and keep them closed till I say you can open them again.
Camilleona and I will lead you. It�s in the kitchen.�

&nbsp;

�Now, do I hear a promise to
keep your eyes closed until told?� Marina gently insisted. �If you open your eyes it will
spoil it!�.�, she sweetly emphasised.

&nbsp;

�Okay! Okay! Okay!�
Seraphima exclaimed, �Look. My eyes are closed�, she giggled, just after she
had made herself go cross-eyed, and held her eyes looking down her pretty nose,
making Marina and Camilleona laugh in unison.

&nbsp;

�I�ll put a blindfold on you
young lady, if you can�t behave!� Marina laughed.

&nbsp;

�My eyes are closed! Look!
Look! My eyes are closed!� Seraphima insisted with excitement in her lovely
voice, and with her eyes really closed this time.

&nbsp;

Two hands now held
Seraphima�s, and led the sweet negress angel the short
distance to the kitchen.

&nbsp;

As the kitchen door was
closed behind the assembled trinity: �Open them!� Marina instructed, referring, of course, to Seraphima�s
stunning eyes.

&nbsp;

As Seraphima opened her
devil-deep-dark-chocolate-brown-eyes, she stared, with her lovely �O� for
orgasm mouth, open with astonishment�

&nbsp;

Her face, the heart-rending,
heart-stopping face before her, was heart shaped, and white as the fullest full
moon.

&nbsp;

Delicious freckles frolicked
delightfully lightly across the pretty little nose.

&nbsp;

She was ghost pale by
nature: the same nature that had given her, her near translucent complexion.

&nbsp;

Her stature and stance were
all that was queen.

&nbsp;

Her eyes shone ice-green.

&nbsp;

The apparent apparition wore
her glorious golden red curls, in teasing pleasing tumultuous swirls, that tumbled in copious cape, from her lovely head,
to dangle and dandle, below her very trim ankles.

&nbsp;

As she bent her
exceptionally pretty legs in a complete-and-utter-obedience-confirming,
extremely sexy curtsy:

&nbsp;

�Good
morning my lady Seraphima. I do
so hope you will be pleased to accept me as your slave�, Teasetta Loveschild
whispered.

&nbsp;

The End
