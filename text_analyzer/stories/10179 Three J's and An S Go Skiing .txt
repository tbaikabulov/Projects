Four young college girls on a skiing vacation have to find other things to do when an excess of
new snow traps them in their cabin.&nbsp; They find out things about themselves that they had only

Julie, Judy, and Joan had been friends since before kindergarten.&nbsp; When their mothers car pooled for school events, etc, they spoke of "picking up The Three J's."&nbsp; Teachers, and most of the community soon started referring to them as "The Three J's."&nbsp; In the fourth grade, Sara's mother went to work for Julie's mother as a cook and housekeeper, and since her mom lived in an apartment over the garage, Sara was added to the mix.&nbsp; After that, they became known to their parents, teachers and most of the community as "The Three J's and an S."

To a great extent, Sara was always the "tag along."&nbsp;&nbsp; Partly this was because of the difference in economic status.&nbsp; The Three J's were "from money" with generations of refinement and tradition.&nbsp; Sara was "working class" who cleaned up well, but remained slightly an outsider.&nbsp; Partly Sara was the odd one out because of physical differences.&nbsp; The Three J's were from Scandinavian stock with pale skin, light hair, and blue eyes.&nbsp; Sara was always slightly shorter, more than slightly less pale, and had dark hair and deep brown eyes.&nbsp; But primarily, Sara was the tag along because of the difference in personality.

From their time in pre-school together, The Three J's were all alpha-females with strong personalities and always somewhat of a handful for their parents and their teachers.&nbsp; Sara, on the other hand, was more of a beta, gamma, or even delta personality and tended to defer to whatever The Three J's said or did.

Sara was always the quiet little girl in the corner who never caused any problems in class.&nbsp; Still, The Three J's accepted her for what she was, or perhaps despite what she was.&nbsp; Conversely, she accepted The Three J's for what they were and accepted that she wasn't quite their equal and would never be as close as these three girls who had totally grown up together. 

It was slightly surprising to some people that The Three J's did not reject Sara when they reached the cliquey female society that is junior high and high school.&nbsp; Many unequal friendships often fall apart at that time, but the four remained very close knit.&nbsp; They seemed to have a special bond - and everyone knew it.

The few times that Sara was picked on by stronger students, The Three J's made it plain to the transgressor that she was under their protection.&nbsp; She was a part of their group... and she truly was.&nbsp; There was even a picture of all four of them in the yearbook together in their cheerleader outfits.&nbsp; It was a standard cheerleader shot where all four were in the air, their hands raised and legs bent back in a cheer of some sort.&nbsp; The football field was in the background, and across the top of the picture in white script was the caption, "Three J's and an S."&nbsp; 

It was no surprise that all four girls decided to go to the same college.&nbsp; What did surprise most people is that The Three J's chose one of the state universities rather than a more prestigious, private college.&nbsp; All four girls, however, had decided that, in one form or another, their careers were going to be in education, and the state schools were viewed as a better undergraduate basis for that.

Sara was planning to teach grade school, which was a good plan because even an undergraduate degree was a financial strain for her and her mother.&nbsp; The Three J's, for whom finances were much less of a problem, were planing on advanced degrees and future teaching positions at prestigious private schools or larger universities.

Because the state university was originally a "normal school," the old term for a teacher's college, fraternities and sororities were banned in its charter.&nbsp; After the freshman year, however, students could live off campus in apartments or private residences.

Naturally, starting their second year, The Three J's and an S roomed together.&nbsp; It was a rather nice apartment in a good area of town. The rent and other expenses were split three ways by Julie, Judy, and Joan.&nbsp; Sara paid her share by cooking and cleaning for the four.&nbsp; She also ran necessary errands for the household.

Joan's father had a timeshare for a skiing cabin out west, and during their junior year, the four girls decided that they would spend Christmas break skiing.&nbsp; Two weeks were available starting four days before Christmas, which was perfect for their schedules.&nbsp; They would be able to be there for at least ten days if Julie borrowed her father's four wheel drive SUV, and they team-drove the nineteen hours to get there.

As they pulled out of town, the roof rack held four sets of skis.&nbsp; The Three J's all owned their own, and Judy's younger sister had loaned Sara her equipment.&nbsp; Four suitcases were also firmly strapped to the roof rack.&nbsp; The back of the SUV was packed totally full of food, additional clothing and two cases of wine.

Julie had asked her father to pick up a couple of bottles of her favorite wine and put them in the back of the SUV before he brought it over to the school and switched cars with her.&nbsp; She was surprised when he asked, "Are you sure you girls are going to drink that much wine at the cabin.&nbsp; You will probably be up at the lodge most of the time?"

Julie answered, "Of course, dad, we are college students," but she didn't restate her request.&nbsp; His comment made much more sense later when she found two cases, rather than two bottles of wine in the back of the SUV.

Judy's only comment when she saw the two cases was, "Whoa!&nbsp; We are going to have to do some serious drinking to take care of that in ten days."
Nineteen hours is a long time to drive, even rotating through four drivers.&nbsp;&nbsp; Counting in gas breaks and food stops the trip actually lasted a little over 23 hours, which is just what the trip software said it would take.&nbsp;&nbsp; Since they had left at almost three in the afternoon, and crossed two time zones, it was a little before one, local time, when they got to the cabin.

Joan had explained that the cabin was about half way up the mountain on a little-used side road that was kept open all winter because it was the supply road for the lodge at the top.&nbsp; They would be able to ski directly from the cabin down a side trail to the main trail that led to the chair lifts.&nbsp; Then they could ride the lifts up to the lodge at the top.&nbsp;&nbsp; At the end of the day, it was just a matter of cutting off the main trail about half way down onto another side trail that would lead them to the cabin.

What Joan had not mentioned was that this was the only cabin on this stretch of road.&nbsp; The nearest neighbor was at least a half-mile away.&nbsp;&nbsp; Effectively, they had the mountain to themselves.

Judy had been checking weather on her smart phone throughout the trip and kept talking about a big snow storm that was supposed to hit shortly before they got there.&nbsp; Julie was overjoyed that new powder would make the slopes perfect, but Joan was worried that it might close the road before they got to the cabin and they would have to stay in a hotel for several days until the road was reopened.

The last several hours they were driving in swirling snow.&nbsp; It wasn&#8217;t a blizzard as such, because there was no wind, but there was a LOT of snow.&nbsp;&nbsp; In a two-wheel drive vehicle they wouldn't have made it.&nbsp; When they got to the mountain road, snow was falling rather heavily, but the road appeared to still be passable for the four-wheel drive SUV.&nbsp; Julie and Judy weren't sure that they shouldn't turn around and wait out the storm somewhere, but Joan knew the road and how far they had to go, and was sure that they could get to the cabin.&nbsp; They continued through the deep snow and arrived without incident.&nbsp; It was obvious, however, that the heavy snow continuing to fall ruled out going out on the slopes until the storm had passed.

The girls dragged everything except the skis up the steps into the cabin.&nbsp; Then they lugged the skis around to the back of the cabin and placed them in an outdoor rack on the side of the deck steps.&nbsp; Since the skis had already been waxed and prepared they did not need to be brought up to room temperature for tuning and would be ready for them when they wanted them in the morning.

As the girls came up the back steps onto the deck, they noticed that there was a hot tub mounted level with the floor.&nbsp; Three large infrared heaters hung from the roof above the deck.&nbsp;&nbsp; Joan explained, "All we have to do is turn on those heaters and the deck will be as warm as inside.&nbsp; There are some roll down clear covers that we can bring down if there is too much wind."&nbsp; She then flipped a large switch next to the door and the deck was suddenly bathed in warm, red light.

"Let that melt off any snow on the deck," said Joan, "and then I will fill the hot tub.&nbsp; It should be ready in about two or three hours."

Julie looked at her and said, "You should have told us to bring swimsuits."

Joan responded, "The deck is totally hidden from the road and that is a mountain behind us.&nbsp; This is totally private."&nbsp; Then she added with a snicker, "We don't need no stinking swimsuits."

The Three J's laughed at the movie reference, but Sara remained quiet and turned her eyes toward the ground.

The girls were soon settled into the cabin, and Sara began preparing an evening meal.&nbsp;&nbsp; While Sara worked in the kitchen, The Three J's changed into lightweight sweats, commonly referred to as pajama jeans, and sat around in the living room talking.&nbsp; Meanwhile, the snow outside got heavier and heavier.&nbsp; 

After supper, while Sara was cleaning up the kitchen, The Three J's returned to the living room to try out the satellite TV, but nothing would come in.&nbsp; "The snow must be really coming down thick." commented Joan.&nbsp; "It is really unusual for the dish to not pick up anything."

Judy, who had been intently studying her smart phone, looked up and announced, "Ladies, I think we are officially snowed in.&nbsp; According to this, we have already gotten over two feet of snow and we are getting three to four inches of powder an hour.&nbsp; The storm is stalled over the mountains, so this could go on all night and most of tomorrow.&nbsp; That would be five feet - or more - of additional snow."

Julie patted the top of one of the cases of wine that were stacked next to the couch, "Well then," she said, "I guess it's lucky we have adequate provisions for the week."

"Too bad there isn't room in the refrigerator to chill the wine properly." said Joan.&nbsp; "I could only put one bottle in there and it was a tight fit."&nbsp; 

Judy piped up, "Well, duh, isn't that a bunch of frozen stuff just outside the back door.&nbsp; All we have to do is put the cases down on the picnic table in the back yard, and then go out and get a bottle - or two - when we need it."

She paused a moment and then yelled into the kitchen, "Sara, would you please take the cases of wine out and put them on the picnic table?&nbsp; None of us is still dressed and you still have your jeans on."

Sara said, "In a minute," and shortly thereafter came into the living room and carried the first case outside.&nbsp; 

"Aren't you going to put on your coat?" asked Joan.&nbsp; 

To which Sara replied, "I like the cold.&nbsp; It is refreshing."

When Sara returned for the second case, Judy exclaimed, "Jees girl!&nbsp; You're barefoot!"

Sara blushed deeply and answered, "It isn't that cold, and I like the feel of the snow against my bare skin."

Julie gave a short laugh and said, "Wow, turned on by snow.&nbsp; That's a new one for me."

Sara turned an even deeper shade of red.

"Or is it that one of us asked you to go out into the snow that turns you on?" asked Judy.

Although it didn't seem possible, Sara became even a deeper shade of red as she picked up the case of wine and walked out into the snow.

The Three J's looked at one another as they softly said together, "Hmmmmmmmmmm?"&nbsp; Then Joan asked softly, "Have we been missing something all these years?&nbsp; Is Sara actually our love puppy?"

All three girls laughed, but quickly stopped as Sara came back into the cabin.&nbsp; They all drank slowly from their wineglasses to hide their faces as they thought about what had just occurred.

As the room became very silent, Joan suddenly stood up and announced, "I think it&#8217;s time that we tried out the hot tub.&nbsp; I'm going to go change into a robe and then I will meet you all out on the deck."

A few minutes later, the four young women stood on the back deck of the ski cabin in nothing but short robes while Joan explained how the controls for the hot tub worked.&nbsp; "You saw where the heaters turned on," she said.&nbsp; "And over there at the end of the deck is the switch that turns on the bubblers and brings the tub up to full temperature.&nbsp;&nbsp; There is some sort of weird regulation that it can't stay on for more than 30 minutes and that the control has to be at least 8 feet from the edge of the tub."

Joan pointed to a large, white, button-switch that was mounted on the wall just over the rail at the end of the deck.&nbsp; Evidently the heaters did not cover the last several inches of the deck because the rail and a few inches of the deck itself at that end were still covered heavily in snow.

Judy said, "Sara, why don't you go over and punch the button and then join us in the tub."&nbsp; The Three J's then set their robes on a chair, picked up their glasses of wine, and started to get into the tub.&nbsp; As Sara started to walk to the end of the deck, Joan added, "If you lean over the railing, you will get your robe wet with snow.&nbsp; Why not just leave it here on the chair with ours?"

Sara walked back, removed her robe, and set it on the chair.&nbsp; Then she walked naked to the other end of the deck.&nbsp; Since the snow was falling so heavily and there was no wind, there was about a foot of snow built up on the wide top railing.&nbsp; Sara's breasts brushed snow off the railing as she leaned forward to press the button.

The Three J's heard Sara's quick intake of breath as the cold snow rubbed against her breasts and belly.&nbsp; When she turned around, her nipples were hard and erect, which was to be expected from the snow.&nbsp; But she was also breathing slowly and deeply and looking slightly upward over the girls heads like someone who was deeply aroused.

When she got back to the tub, she bent over slightly to pick up her glass of wine from a low table next to the deck chairs.&nbsp; The Three J's could see the red light of the heaters reflecting off moisture glistening on her upper thigh.&nbsp; "That isn't snow," mouthed Julie to the other two girls before Sara turned around.

"This is overly weird," gushed Judy.&nbsp; "Here we are sitting naked in a hot tub in the middle of a snowstorm.&nbsp; There must be four feet of snow out there already."

"It's closer to six feet," corrected Joan.&nbsp; "At this altitude, the snow is dryer and more powdery, so it gets deeper.&nbsp; If you look out there, you can barely see the top of the second case of wine..., and they are sitting on top of each other on top the picnic table."

"Speaking of wine," said Julie, "My glass is empty.&nbsp; So is yours Judy.&nbsp; Joan..., down the hatch and we can send Sara inside to bring us refills.&nbsp; You will do that for us, won't you sweetie?"

Sara looked down at the water of the tub, downed her half glass of wine, and began to collect the empty wine glasses from the other girls.&nbsp; The Three J's watched the water drip off her ass cheeks as she carried all four glasses inside.&nbsp; A few moments later she returned with a tray holding the four empty glasses and the wine bottle from the refrigerator.&nbsp; There was only a little over an inch of wine in the bottle.

"That's all there is," Sara informed them.

"Oh, contraire," responded Julie, "There are eleven more bottles in the open case and another dozen in the unopened case.&nbsp; Someone just has to walk out to the picnic table and bring a bottle back up here on the deck."

Julie smiled in an odd way at Joan and Judy and then looked into Sara's eyes&nbsp; and continued.&nbsp; "Now is your chance to see if snow really turns you on.&nbsp; And if it is having to go out in the snow FOR US that flips your switch, Sara, I am commanding you to walk out there naked and bring back a bottle of wine for your Three Mistresses."

Sara's eyes opened slightly.&nbsp; She took a deep breath and trembled slightly.&nbsp; The tray of glasses rattled in her hands.&nbsp; Then she swallowed slightly, set the tray down on a low table, and walked over to the steps and started down into the back yard.

The interesting thing about true mountain snow powder is that unless you are held up on top of it by a good set of skis, you sink into it like it is light weight water.&nbsp; As Sara descended the steps, the snow powder split open allowing her to descend to ground level.&nbsp; As she walked toward the picnic table, the snow was above her waist, just below her breasts.&nbsp; The Three J's could hear Sara's ragged breathing as she slowly pushed her way through the icy powder.&nbsp; "One or two?" she called out when she had reached the table.

"Just one for now," answered Judy.&nbsp; After a pause and a quiet giggle, she added, "We can send you back for more later."

There was a sharp intake of breath heard clearly on the deck when Sara heard Judy&#8217;s comment. She opened the carton and removed one bottle of wine and started back through the snow.&nbsp; When she returned to the deck, her body was bright pink from her breasts down.&nbsp; She was shivering slightly.

Julie looked directly at Sara and said, "Pour us all a fresh glass of wine like a good slave, and then join us in the warm water.&nbsp; It looks like you need to warm up a bit."&nbsp; Both Judy and Joan raised their eyebrows, but said nothing.

Sara shuddered slightly and announced, "I need to go inside to get the corkscrew."

"Just make sure you don't screw anything else," giggled Judy as Sara went through the doorway into the cabin.

A few moments later Sara reappeared with the corkscrew.&nbsp; She held the cold bottle of wine between her legs as she forced the corkscrew into the cork.&nbsp; Then turning away from the hot tub, she placed the bottle on the deck and bent over to push down the handles of the screw so that it would pop the cork out of the bottle.&nbsp; As she bent over, she was accidentally - or intentionally - displaying her cunt to The Three J's.

"That definitely isn't snow," whispered Julie.

Shortly after Sara got back into the tub, the bubbles stopped.

Joan looked over at the switch and then at Sara.&nbsp; "Time to go punch the button, my little slut." 

Sara dutifully got out of the tub and walked over to the edge of the deck to push the button.&nbsp; She seemed to bend over for much longer than necessary and seemed to move back and forth as if to rub her nipples in the piled snow on the rail.

For the next half hour The Three J's and an S sat and talked and giggled in the hot tub like a group of college girls out on the town.&nbsp; In many ways it was a girl's night out, except rather than sitting around a table in a club drinking too much wine, they were naked in a hot tub in a snow storm drinking too much wine.&nbsp; At least no one was going to be hitting on them and they didn't have to worry about driving home.

Then the bubbles stopped again.&nbsp; "We are out of bubbles and we are out of wine." announced Judy, holding up her empty glass.&nbsp; "I think it is my turn to issue a command to our little slut slave."

She turned to face Sara whose eyes were wide and whose dark face was a deep shade of red.&nbsp; "Sara, I am commanding you to go over and punch the button.&nbsp; And then I want you to stand on the rail at the end of the deck and do a belly flop into the snow."
"That will get you down to ground level.&nbsp; Then, you are to walk over and get us another bottle of wine.&nbsp; But we are thirsty and you shouldn't keep us waiting, so I want you to hurry.&nbsp; If you don't get all that done in under a minute, I will warm up your ass for you when you get back.&nbsp; One smack for every second that you are late."

Judy then waved her hands indicating that Sara should get moving.&nbsp; Sara gathered up the empty wine glasses, set them on the tray on the low table and walked over to the end of the deck.&nbsp; She leaned across the snow and pushed the button, and then she climbed up on the wide railing, facing outward.&nbsp; She held her arms out wide and fell forward.&nbsp; Normally it would have been a ten or twelve foot drop to the ground, but the snow in that area of the yard was only a few feet beneath the deck supports.&nbsp; Sara fell about four feet and then disappeared into the powder.

The Three J's craned their necks to see what was happening.&nbsp; "You don't think she got hurt do you?" asked Judy.&nbsp; Then they could see the snow moving.&nbsp; Sara was evidently crawling toward the picnic table.&nbsp; After going about ten feet, her head popped up through the powder.&nbsp; The snow in that area of the yard was now almost up to her neck.&nbsp; It was slightly lower when she reached the picnic table.&nbsp; She pulled a bottle out of the case, held it high above her head, and then started walking around the picnic table.

"What is she doing?" asked Joan.&nbsp; 

"Killing time," replied Judy, pointing at a clock mounted on the wall above the hot tub.&nbsp; "She wants to make sure that she doesn't make it back in the time allowed."

 "That's 30 seconds late," Judy yelled out toward the yard a few moments later.&nbsp; "60 seconds... 90 seconds... 120 seconds..."&nbsp; Judy was yelling "150 seconds" just as Sara set the wine bottle on the table.

"Where do you want me?" asked Sara.

"I think we are going to all have to do this together or I am going to wear out my hand."&nbsp; Replied Judy.&nbsp; "Lay across the edge of the tub with your body on the deck and your legs in the water."

Sara did as she was instructed.&nbsp; "This is going to be like those old movies of the guys driving spikes for the railroad.&nbsp; We each take a swat and call out the number."&nbsp; Then, with Judy standing to Sara's left, Julie to her right and Joan directly behind her, they began swinging.

"One, Two, Three.., Four, Five, Six..., Seven, Eight, Nine..."&nbsp; They did indeed sound like track workers driving a spike, except rather than the clink, clink, clink of hammers against a spike, it was the splat, splat, splat of wet hands against ass cheeks.

By the time they reached one hundred, Sara was moaning loudly.&nbsp; At around one hundred twenty- five, she began to thrash on the deck.&nbsp; At one hundred forty-five she groaned loudly and went rigid, vibrating her body in an obvious orgasm.&nbsp; After five more slaps, The Three J's stopped and Judy said, "That's the first time I ever paid a waitress a hundred and fifty smackers for bringing me a bottle of wine.&nbsp; I guess the orgasm was the tip."
The Three J's all laughed and sat back down in the bubbles of the hot tub.&nbsp; Sara lay on the deck for a few moments and then slid into the tub, stood upright, and walked up the entry steps to serve the wine.&nbsp; As she handed each girl their glass of wine, she said to each, "Thank you, Mistress."

Sara got out to push the button two more times before the wine once again was running out.&nbsp; This time it was Joan who spoke.&nbsp; "Sara, we need one final bottle of wine for tonight.&nbsp; But this is what you are going to do.&nbsp; I want you to fully enjoy the snow, so you are going to go over the rail again, but this time backwards.&nbsp; We are going to come over and watch you.&nbsp; When you land on your back in the snow, you are going to lay there until you bring yourself off."

"Once you do that, you will walk, crawl, or whatever you want to do to get over to the picnic table.&nbsp; Then you will bring the bottle of wine back here.&nbsp; You will probably be a little chilled by then, so as soon as you serve us our glasses of wine, you can get back into the tub.&nbsp; We will be sitting on the edge of the tub.&nbsp; I think that after all the pleasure we have given you tonight, you should be willing to give us some pleasure.&nbsp; I think you will know what to do when we get to that point."

Sara nodded and stood up in the tub.&nbsp; Once again she gathered the empty wine glasses and set them on the tray.&nbsp; Then she went over to the edge of the deck, pushed the button, and climbed up onto the rail.&nbsp; Again her hands were held out from her body, but this time she was facing the hot tub.&nbsp; The Three J's were walking across the deck toward her when she fell backward off the deck.

The snow was now almost all the way up to the deck, so she hit the snow only a little below the level of the deck.&nbsp; The powder compressed under her and she stopped on her back on a blanket of compressed snow a little over a foot thick.

She lay there looking up at The Three J's for a moment or two and then brought her hands down between her legs and started rubbing herself.&nbsp; With one hand, she reached over and grabbed some snow and rubbed it against her breasts as her other hand drove in and out of her sopping pussy.&nbsp; Soon an orgasm boiled within her and she screamed out her release.&nbsp; From the deck above, The Three J's applauded as she thrashed about in the snow.

After just a few seconds, Sara forced herself upright in the snow and began pushing through the powder toward the picnic table.&nbsp; In some places the powder was over her head as she walked.&nbsp;&nbsp; This time she didn't delay and brought the bottle quickly up to the deck.&nbsp; Again she held the bottle between her legs to pierce the cork with the corkscrew, and again she displayed her now gaping cunt to The Three J's as she popped the cork out of the bottle.

She handed each of the girls their glass and set her glass and the bottle next to the hot tub.&nbsp; Then, trembling either with the cold or with sexual expectation, she descended into the tub.&nbsp; "I'm first," said Joan as she spread her legs and leaned back with her elbows supporting her on the deck.

Sara picked up her glass of wine and moved over to stand in front of Joan.&nbsp; She took a big swallow of wine into her mouth and immediately bent down and put her mouth over Joan's slit.&nbsp; Joan gasped as the cold wine spilled across her labia, and then gasped again as Sara's tongue began tracing its way up her slit to her pleasure point.&nbsp;&nbsp; Sara teased with her lips and flicked with her tongue until Joan was groaning and shuddering in the throws of a tremendous orgasm.

"I'll have what she's having," said Judy with laugh.&nbsp; But Julie said loudly, "I'm next."

Sara again took a big mouthful of wine and again pushed the wine into Julie's waiting cunt.&nbsp; "Aaah!" groaned Julie as the cold liquid entered her.&nbsp; Soon she was repeating "Aaah..., aaah..., aaah," as Sara's skillful tongue and lips took her higher and higher.&nbsp; Julie was a screamer and it is entirely possible that the people in the cabin a half-mile up the road heard her shrill cry as she climaxed.

Sara moved over to Judy, who said, "Let's take this slow so I can really enjoy it."

Be careful what you wish for, you just may get it.&nbsp; Almost a half-hour later, Judy was writhing on the side of the tub held on the edge of orgasm by Sara's tongue and lips and by repeated doses of wine forced into her steaming pussy.&nbsp; She started grunting, "Uh.., uh.., uh.., uh..," in time with Sara's lapping tongue.

Julie and Joan began clapping with her, chanting in cheerleader fashion, "Go, go, go, go, go." 

Judy exploded.&nbsp; She threw her legs over Sara's shoulders and drew her tightly into her cunt.&nbsp; She bucked and writhed against Sara's face while Sara abandoned her tongue and began lightly biting Judy's labia and her clit with her teeth.&nbsp; This time the cabins a mile away probably heard Judy&#8217;s cries mixed with the cheering voices of Julie and Joan who screamed, "Judy... Judy... Scooooooore!!" as Judy rocketed through a second and third shattering orgasm.

When Judy finally quieted down, the four girls sat on the edge of the hot tub finishing their wine until&nbsp; Joan finally said, "I think it is time for bed.&nbsp; I have a feeling we can sleep in tomorrow because with this storm we won't be going skiing."

Julie yawned, smiled and said, "I think we will find something to keep us occupied."

As the four got out of the tub, Sara scurried into the cabin before them.&nbsp; As The Three J's entered, they found Sara on her knees with her head bowed almost to the floor.&nbsp; Her arms were straight back level with the slant of her back and spread slightly from her body.&nbsp; "Do my Mistresses require anything else of their slut slave tonight?&nbsp; If not, I will clean things up and make sure everything is ready for tomorrow's meals."

The three girls looked at each other and then Joan spoke.&nbsp; "There is one thing, Sara.&nbsp; We really should have a bottle of wine in the refrigerator.&nbsp; So you need to go out and bring one in."

Judy added, "And the empty bottles need to be put back in the case for recycling."

Julie finished with, "One at a time."

"Oh, thank you," answered Sara.&nbsp; "May I pleasure myself while I do that?"
"With your hands or with one of the bottles or with your tongue if you are limber enough," answered Joan.&nbsp; "And tomorrow we need to sit down and talk about how our relationship has changed."

"I have always fantasized that the&nbsp; 'S' stood for slave." said Sara softly.&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking up into the girls questioning eyes, she added, "Three J's and a Slave.&nbsp; I've always been yours.&nbsp; And you have always been my Masters.&nbsp; Now you just know it.&nbsp; But yes, we need to talk about what tonight will mean for the future.&nbsp; Good night Mistress J's."

As The Three J's started toward their bedrooms, they stopped to watch out the rear window for a moment as Sara did a swan dive into the deep snow that now covered the back yard to the level of the deck.

Julie, Judy, and Joan slept until after eleven.&nbsp; By the time they had awakened, Sara had the cabin completely cleaned and straightened up.&nbsp; The Three J's took their time showering and finally emerged into the living room around noon.&nbsp; They were all wearing the same light, pajama-like sweatsuits they had been wearing the previous evening before stripping down and going into the hot tub on the back deck.

Sara was wearing a long nightshirt with a giant picture of Sponge Bob Square Pants on it.&nbsp; It made her look like a little girl, but anyone who had been watching her clean the cabin would have known immediately that she was NOT a little girl.&nbsp; That was because as she cleaned, Sponge Bob was hanging on the doorknob of the closet in the kitchen.

Sara liked doing housework naked.&nbsp; It made her feel free and alive, while at the same time allowed her to feel that she was a naked slave serving her masters.&nbsp; Her breasts had bounced freely as she moved quickly around the living room, not only picking up the minor litter from the night before, but also cleaning and dusting every surface in the room.&nbsp; When she heard The Three J's begin stirring, she scurried over to put on her night shirt and then went into the kitchen to begin preparing breakfast.

Sara, unlike The Three J's, had always been an early riser.&nbsp; In their apartment at the university, she would always get up around 5:00 and clean the living room and kitchen and do up the dishes from the night before.&nbsp; She always did this naked, and just like this morning, when she heard The Three J's beginning to stir, she would put on her nightshirt and begin preparing breakfast.&nbsp; None of them had ever seen her cleaning in the nude.&nbsp; That was her little secret.&nbsp; Nor did they see her cleaning their bedrooms or the bathrooms naked.&nbsp; That she always did when the three of them were in class.

As Julie, Judy and Joan came into the room, she called out, "Breakfast will be ready in a moment.&nbsp; Your choice is eggs or waffles.&nbsp; I already have the bacon done and the coffee on."

The Three J's voted for eggs and gathered 'round the kitchen table.&nbsp; In a few moments, the eggs were done and Sara joined them.&nbsp; As they were eating, Joan said, "Sara, we have to talk about last night."&nbsp; She paused and added, "...this morning..."&nbsp; Another pause, "...when we haven't each had a bottle of wine."

Sara turned slightly pink and answered, "The wine only brought out what was already there.&nbsp; I have been your obedient slave since the fifth grade.&nbsp; I like it.&nbsp; I enjoy serving you.&nbsp; And you have always protected me and taken care of me."

Joan continued, "But you have not always been our slut slave.&nbsp; You have been our friend, and we want you to continue to be our friend."

"Does that mean you didn't like what happened last night?"

"No," blurted out Judy.&nbsp; "That was fabulous.&nbsp; It would almost be enough to make me give up on men."&nbsp; She turned slightly red and continued, "But sex has a way of messing up friendships, and The Three J's and an S have been together for a long time."

"Does that mean we can't do anything like last night again?" asked Sara.&nbsp; The fear and disappointment in her voice was obvious.

"What we have to do," explained Joan, "is set down some new rules."&nbsp; She looked around the table.&nbsp; "Sara, you need to know when we want a slut slave and when we want a friend."

Sara swallowed and nodded and Julie continued.&nbsp; "And we need to know when you want to be treated as a friend and when you wanted to be treated as a slave."

"I am always your slave," answered Sara.

"Ok,' said Judy.&nbsp; "Then we need to know when you want us to treat you as our friend slave and when we should treat you as our slut slave.&nbsp; If we don't know what each other wants and expects and what each other's limits are, then we will screw up a really wonderful friendship for all of us."

Joan took Sara's hand and asked, "Sara, what are your limits.&nbsp; What is it that turns you on and what don't you want or won't allow."

Sara sat thinking for several minutes.&nbsp; She began, "I think you have already realized that I have this thing for snow."&nbsp; Everyone laughed.&nbsp; "And it is pretty obvious that once I am turned on, spanking really takes me over the edge."

She looked up like she was trying to recall something or go over a list in her head, "But I don't want anything that will permanently injure me or mark me.&nbsp; No tattoos or brands or anything like that unless I decide to get them."

She twisted her mouth in an odd way as she thought, "And nothing, of course, that would get me or any of us kicked out of school or hurt my - or your - future careers."

Joan nodded her head.&nbsp; "It sounds like you have thought about this a little."

"Fantasized is more like it," answered Sara, lowering her eyes and staring at the table.&nbsp; "But I never thought any of this would become anything but a fantasy."

Judy spoke, "It's a reality now, and we have to work with that new reality.&nbsp; Some things will change.&nbsp; Some thing will not.&nbsp; And we have to figure out what does what."

Julie asked suddenly, as if she had just thought of it, "Do you have a safe word?"

Everyone looked at her and she stammered out,&nbsp; "I read the book... and some stories on line...&#8221;&nbsp; She turned bright red.&nbsp; "OK, a lot of stories on line, but I know what a safe word is."

"So do I," said Sara softly.&nbsp; "My safe word is 'summertime.'" She smiled and added, "Summer is the opposite of winter.&nbsp; I don't really like hot weather."

The Three J's laughed.&nbsp; "Summertime it is," said Julie.&nbsp; "As long as it is winter, things are OK, but if it turns to summer, it is time to stop."

Joan added, "Then the logical 'slow down' word would be 'springtime.'&nbsp; If things are getting close to summertime, then 'springtime' tells us to back off."

"Winter, full speed ahead.&nbsp; Springtime, back off.&nbsp; Summer, stop.&nbsp; I got it," said Julie.

"But that still doesn't solve the problem of how we know for sure whether or not the snow is falling - or about to fall," said Judy, who then raised her hands and shoulders in that way that means "I don't know," and asked, "Any suggestions?"

"I have an idea," said Joan, and she got up and went back into her bedroom.&nbsp; She returned a moment later carrying something black that looked like a short velvet belt.

"This is one of three I bought online a while back to use as a straps to hold my skis together for storage.&nbsp; It has a Velcro catch that will grip at almost any size and it has my initials embroidered on it in gold.&nbsp; The only problem is that it isn't waterproof.&nbsp; I ended up throwing out the other two after only one season because they were so water damaged from melted snow."

Joan set the strap on the table.&nbsp; In golden script it said "J J J."

Sara said, "The Three J's." 

To which Joan answered, "And also my initials.- Joan Judith Johnson."

She held up the strap and Sara put it around her neck.&nbsp; It fit perfectly and looked great.&nbsp; Her face was framed in the outline of the black of her hair and the black of the collar.&nbsp; She looked truly beautiful at that moment.&nbsp; Her smile was beaming and her eyes were bright with happiness.

Joan continued.&nbsp; "The collar will stay in a special drawer in the hutch in the living room.&nbsp; Or when we are traveling together, it will be in a place we all agreed on.&nbsp; Whenever we want our slut slave friend to make an appearance, we will set the collar out on the table.&nbsp; And whenever Sara is willing to play - or needs her masters in a special way, she can just put on the collar.&nbsp; We will all know what it means."

"I could even wear it in public and no one would really know," said Sara softly.&nbsp; "It looks like a velvet choker."

"I could even get '&amp; an S' embroidered on it in the same thread" added Joan.

&#8220;I like it the way it is,&#8221; replied Sara.

"That sounds like we have that figured out - more or less," said Julie.

"And that will look much better on you than on a pair of skis, " added Judy.

"Our skis!!!" shouted Joan suddenly, as she jumped to her feet, her eyes wide open.

Everyone was looking at her with questioning looks on their faces.

"We hung them on the storage rack next to the deck.&nbsp; They are several feet beneath the snow.&nbsp; As it packs down today, it might warp or even break them.&nbsp; We have to get them out of there."

All four girls ran to the back windows.&nbsp; The snow had almost stopped falling and the clouds were beginning to give way to sunny skies.&nbsp; There was at least two feet of snow on the deck and it was level with the snow powder in the yard.&nbsp;&nbsp; 

"I've seen powder snows like this before - well not exactly like this," said Joan in a very serious voice.&nbsp; "I've never seen it this deep, but once the sun comes out, the powder will settle and pack.&nbsp; By tomorrow at this time it will be half that deep and you will be able to walk across it.&nbsp; If we don't get those skis out before the powder packs and warms, they will be damaged."

 "Does that mean we have to go out there and shovel our way down to the ground?" whined Julie.

"No," answered Joan, "Sara and I will go under the deck through the basement.&nbsp; There is a door next to the steps that opens inward.&nbsp; We should be able to dig into the snow from the doorway and get to the skis.&nbsp; There is only enough room under there for one or two people to work, so you girls stay up here.&nbsp; Turn the heaters on the back deck on and once the snow has melted away, take the covers off the tub.&nbsp; We might go back into the tub later this afternoon."

Judy smirked, and Joan added - "to soak and warm up."&nbsp; 

All four girls laughed.

"Besides," added Joan, "The heater switch also switches the hot tub from standby to pre-heat.&nbsp; Between the heaters and the hot water circulating in the system, the area beneath the deck should be warm enough to work in without freezing our asses off while we dig out the skis."

Joan opened the closet and took out her coat and walked back toward the bedroom to change.&nbsp; She returned shortly dressed in jeans.&nbsp; Meanwhile, Sara said, "I'll turn on the heaters," and she quickly opened the back door and stepped out onto the deck to flip the heater switch."

"We might as well watch some TV until you guys get finished," said Julie.

"Yell for us if you need help, " added Judy as they sat down on the couch.

"Sara, you might want to put on something warmer," said Joan.&nbsp; "We are going to be working, not making love.&nbsp; And set the collar on the table so it doesn't get wet while we work.&nbsp; I need a friend slave to help me, not a slut slave to eat me out"

"I'm always ready to be - or do - either." answered Sara.

Joan started to put on her coat and Sara continued,&nbsp; "And I'll let you know if it gets too cold for me." She then opened the basement door and started down the steps wearing only her Sponge Bob nightshirt.

The basement of the cabin was "semi-finished."&nbsp; What that really means is that even though the basement was effectively at ground level on three sides, they were never able to properly solve the groundwater problems, so there was no carpet on the floors and no paneling on the walls.&nbsp; There was nice furniture and a finished ceiling, but nothing that couldn't be moved if things got a little wet.&nbsp; 

The stairs came down into the basement in a large, open room that took up the back half of the space.&nbsp; The front half was divided between two bedrooms that looked out onto the highway.&nbsp; The doors to the two bedrooms were on the interior wall.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the middle of the back wall, there was a single, exterior-style door that opened inward into the basement.

As Joan reached to open the door, she explained to Sara, "The deck isn't closed in, but it is pretty close.&nbsp; There are little gaps between the boards to allow ventilation, but the snow doesn't usually get under the deck, and what does rapidly melts when the hot tub heaters kick in."

Joan went through the doorway.&nbsp; "Watch your step," she instructed as she stepped down six to eight inches.

Sara was surprised to see that the floor under the deck was concrete and had curbs around it almost like a highway.&nbsp;&nbsp; There was a large drain in the middle of the area.&nbsp;&nbsp; The hot tub itself was built on a foundation of concrete blocks and bricks.&nbsp; A large water tank and pump stood next to the wall of the tub.&nbsp; The pump was whirring softly.&nbsp; A couple of red lights glowed on an electrical control panel.

Joan reached up and pulled a string to turn on a light.&nbsp; Sara could see a small amount of snow against the outer walls.&nbsp; It was cool, but not overly uncomfortable in the small enclosure.

Joan pointed to the floor, "This catches any rainwater that comes under the deck in the summer and channels it under the house and out toward the road.&nbsp; We don't have to worry about what to do with the snow we pull in, it will just melt and go down the drain."&nbsp; Then she opened the outer door.

The snow had been packed tightly against the outer door.&nbsp; There was an impression of the individual boards apparent on the face of the snow, and there was a small hole where the lever- like doorknob had been pulled free when the door opened.&nbsp; 

Joan reached into a dark area alongside the hot tub and pulled out two small camp shovels.&nbsp; "These are for cleaning out the fire ring in the summer, but they will work for digging a hole in the snow to retrieve our skis."&nbsp;&nbsp; 

Some water dripped through the deck&nbsp;&nbsp; Evidently the heaters were beginning to melt off the snow.&nbsp; Another drop fell, hitting Sara on the shoulder.

"Are you sure you don't want to go put on something warmer," asked Joan.

"It would just get wet," answered Sara, "and once your clothes are soaked - especially denim, you are better off being naked."&nbsp; With that she pulled her Sponge Bob nightshirt over her head and threw it back out into the basement of the cabin.

Joan squeaked as several drops of icy water fell onto her neck from above.&nbsp; Handing one of the shovels to Sara, she said, "We had best get digging."

It took about fifteen minutes before they were at the tips of the skis.&nbsp; At that point, they had a tunnel into the snow about two feet long and three or four feet high starting from about two feet above the ground.&nbsp; "Damn," said Joan as she tried to pull one of the sets of skis into the basement.&nbsp; "I was hoping the powder would still be loose enough to pull the skis out, but it looks like we are going to have to clear the whole length of the ski."

She unscrewed the retainer for the front of the shovel and turned the head so that it now looked more like a hoe than a shovel.&nbsp; "Just pull it into the room," she said and started attacking the snow with her shovel-hoe.

The snow was packed just enough to make it difficult to pull the skis loose without damaging them, but it was still loose enough to move easily and rapidly as Joan and Sara swung again and again with their camp shovels.&nbsp; In another fifteen or twenty minutes, there was about a foot of snow on the floor rapidly melting into the drain, and they had a tunnel nearly the length of the skis that extended from just above ground level to the top of the uppermost ski.&nbsp; Sara was dripping with icy water.&nbsp; Joan's clothing was soaked to the skin.&nbsp; Surprisingly, it was Joan, not Sara who was shivering.

"How do you do that?" asked Joan.&nbsp; "I'm freezing, and you're the one who is naked."

"I told you that once you are wet, it is better if you are naked.&nbsp; Those cotton jeans are wicking water and evaporating on the surface.&nbsp;&nbsp; That makes them colder than my wet skin.&nbsp; Your ski pants are special blends to prevent that, but right now, you would be better off naked."

"Hell with it," muttered Joan.&nbsp; "Never know if you don't try."&nbsp; Soon her wet jeans and underwear were in a heap on the floor of the basement.&nbsp; "Tops dry," she said, and kept her coat on.&nbsp; She looked rather odd with naked legs and crotch below, and a heavy ski parka on top.

Sara entered the tunnel and began chopping snow and pushing it back toward Joan who was nearer the doorway.&nbsp; Soon the bottommost set of skis was clear, and Joan carried them back into the basement.&nbsp; Two more sets soon followed.&nbsp; Sara had to go back to the end of the tunnel to clear some hard packed snow from the uppermost set of skis, but soon Joan was also carrying them into the basement.

Just as she set them inside the doorway, she heard a loud gasp and felt a blast of cold air.&nbsp; She turned and could see daylight through the outer door.&nbsp; She could also see Sara buried to her breasts in the snow that had filled the tunnel when the end of it collapsed.&nbsp; 

"Help me," said Sara quietly, but with fear in her voice, "I'm stuck."

Joan hurried into the tunnel and pulled on Sara's outstretched arms.&nbsp; She couldn't budge her.

"You need to clear some of the snow first." said Sara.&nbsp; Then she added quickly, "Make sure you don't hit my feet."

Joan grabbed her shovel and rapidly, but carefully, began clearing the snow from the tunnel.&nbsp; It only took a few minutes until she was within inches of Sara's legs.&nbsp; She threw her shovel back into the area under the deck and again pulled on Sara's arms.&nbsp; This time, Sara pulled free from the snow.

When they both got back beneath the deck, Sara was shivering violently.&nbsp; "Are you OK?"&nbsp; Joan asked.

"Just cold," answered Sara.&nbsp; "The collapse scared me and I lost my fire."

"What?" said Joan.

"Snow turns me on, but only if I am already a little bit turned on or want to be turned on.&nbsp; Being half buried by an avalanche of snow and thinking I might die sort of kills the mood, so I lost my fire and got cold." 

"So," asked Joan, "if I were really turned on, the snow wouldn't be cold to me?"

"Maybe not," answered Sara.&nbsp; "It works for me, but it might not work for everyone."

Joan said, "Then lets get you warmed back up."&nbsp; She gave her a strange smile and added, "And maybe we will try a 'Coolie' before going up into the hot tub."

Joan threw her coat into the basement and lifted her sweatshirt over her head.

"What's a coolie?" asked Sara?

"That's a quickie in a snowbank," answered Joan as her mouth closed over Sara's.

In a few moments both girls were squirming against each other with one leg pushed between the other's so that they could rub against each other's clits.

"Warmed up?" asked Joan.

"Mm-huh," answered Sara.

"You ready?" 

"For what?" asked Sara.

"A sixty-nine in a snowbank." answered Joan.&nbsp;&nbsp; She then pulled Sara over toward the still open outer door.&nbsp; "I'm going to be on bottom, so you'd better light my fire really hot, really fast.&nbsp; Once we have both 'melted the snow,' we will run up and jump in the hot tub."

Sara giggled, said, "Let's go," and ran out into the tunnel with Joan right behind her.&nbsp; She stood facing the door with her head in the clear area of the collapse.&nbsp; Then she giggled again and said, "There's no way to do this slowly.&nbsp; Just dive into the snow and turn over.&nbsp; I'll dive into you and we will both melt some snow." 

Joan did exactly that.&nbsp; She dove into the snow between Sara's legs, squealing as her body hit the cold ground.&nbsp; Then she immediately turned over so she was face up between Sara's legs..

Sara also did exactly as she had said she would and literally dove onto Joan and began hungrily sucking at her labia and clit.&nbsp; Joan was soon moaning in passion.&nbsp; 

Joan returned the favor and tongued and licked between Sara's legs.&nbsp; Within moments both were crying out in climax.

Sara almost immediately jumped up from Joan and pulled the shivering girl to her feet.&nbsp; "Hot tub time," she said and climbed up out of the tunnel into the back yard.&nbsp; Joan quickly followed her, and after Sara detoured to hit the white button, both of them were warming up in the tub.

The noise of the bubblers starting up brought Judy and Julie to the back door.&nbsp; "How'd you guys get up here?" asked Julie.

"Skis are in the basement," responded Joan, "but the snow collapsed on us and we had to come out through the tunnel into the back yard.

"So where are your clothes?" asked Judy with her typical smirk.

"Didn't you know that once you are wet, you are better off naked that in denim?" answered Joan. 

"It was very wet down there," added Sara, trying to sound serious as they both dissolved into laughter.

Joan asked, "Would you two please go downstairs and close up the doors under the deck and then bring our clothes back up here for us?&nbsp; After that, join us in the tub.&nbsp; We can send Sara out for wine later."

A few minutes later Judy and Julie came back out on the deck.&nbsp; Judy was wearing her short robe, but Julie was naked.&nbsp; They had just joined Joan and Sara in the hot tub when the four of them hear the whine of snowmobile engines.

Two bright orange snowmobiles with flashing yellow strobe lights mounted on them drove into the back yard.&nbsp; The drivers wore bright red snowmobile suits with white crosses on the back and the words "Snow Rescue" above and below the cross.

One of the drivers got off his snowmobile and walked up the steps of the deck.&nbsp; He was talking on a radio set as he got to the top of the steps.&nbsp; "Checking in from cabin 19," he said.&nbsp; "Cabin is occupied.&nbsp; Power is on."

Sara got out of the tub and walked over to him.&nbsp; "May I help you?" she asked.

He took off his goggles and smiled at her and answered, "Maybe later.&nbsp; Right now, we have over thirty more cabins to check before dark."

He looked at the naked girl standing in front of him and then over to the three naked girls who were scrunched down low in the hot tub trying to keep their breasts below the bubbling water.&nbsp; "Only the four of you?" he asked.

"Yes," answered Sara.

He keyed his radio, "Four occupants.&nbsp; All four occupants accounted for."

There was a garbled response on the radio that none of the girls could understand.

The man chuckled and keyed his radio again.&nbsp; "Yes, they are all OK.&nbsp; In fact, they are more than OK.&nbsp; All four of them are fine - mighty fine."

He smiled at Sara, clipped the radio back on his belt, and said,&nbsp; "You might want to get back in the tub to stay warm, miss."&nbsp;&nbsp; 

She just pointed up at the heaters over her head and said, "It is almost too warm here.&nbsp; I might have to go out in the snow to cool off."

He laughed and then addressed all four girls,&nbsp; "OK, here's the deal.&nbsp; The storm has passed.&nbsp; We will be running the groomers on the slopes all night tonight and things will be ready by mid- morning tomorrow.&nbsp; Even the side trails will be back in top condition by noon.&nbsp; If you girls want to ski tomorrow, the lifts will be running by 9:00am, but the lodge won't be open for another day or so until they get the road open.&nbsp; That's state fire regulations.&nbsp; Most of the cabins are empty, so you will have the slopes practically to yourself until the lodge re-opens.&nbsp; Hope you enjoy it."

He walked back down the steps and got back onto his snowmobile.&nbsp; As the two snowmobiles whined off into the distance, Joan said to Sara, "Your collar is inside on the table, but I don't think we want to get it all wet.&nbsp; If you are in the mood again tonight, just go down into the snow and bring us back a bottle of wine."

Sara walked down the steps into the snow.&nbsp; It was more solid now, but she still sank to her knees in the packed powder.&nbsp; After she had pushed her way over to the picnic table, she had to dig down with her hands to open the top case of wine.&nbsp; "One bottle or two," she called out as she reached into the case.

"One for now," yelled back Judy.

"We can send you back for more later," added Julie.

Sara smiled, held the cold bottle of wine against her breasts, and walked back up the steps of deck.

Four young college girls on a skiing vacation have to find other things to do when an excess of new snow traps them in their cabin.&nbsp; This is the third in this series and describes an interesting day of skiing on almost deserted slopes.&nbsp; It might make more sense if you have read "Three J's and an S Go Skiing, Day1&nbsp; &amp; Day 2 ."

For the most part, the stories in this series are pretty mild.

"Come on sleepy heads," yelled Sara.&nbsp; "You told me to wake you up at 8:30 so we could hit the slopes as soon as the lifts were going.&nbsp; Breakfast is on the table."

The Three J's came into the kitchen wearing their nightclothes.&nbsp; Julie was wearing cotton pajamas, and Joan had on a long flannel nightshirt.&nbsp; Judy, however, was wearing a black, almost see through nightie with nothing underneath it.&nbsp; Her nipples puckered slightly as she walked through the cool air next to the patio doors that led to the deck.&nbsp; Her pubic area was completely bare, but Joan, Julie and Sara already knew that from several sessions together in the hot tub.&nbsp; Sara even knew that Judy must have had her bush lasered away because there was no stubble detectable to her tongue, and even the best wax job remains truly that smooth for only a day or two.

"Who were you expecting last night?" asked Julie.

Joan, who was sharing the bedroom with Judy answered, "She says she forgot to pack something to sleep in.&nbsp; That is her 'emergency nightie' that just happened to be in one of the side pockets of her suitcase."

"Who were you hoping to run into up here?" asked Julie.

"The rescue guy was kind of cute," answered Judy.&nbsp; "You never know..., and a girl should be prepared."

"You don't have his number, or his name," said Joan.&nbsp; "So I don't think you have much of a chance with him."

"Oh, I've got his number," answered Judy with a huge smile as she pointed to a big magnet stuck to the front of the refrigerator.&nbsp; It was a red square with a white cross in the middle of it and the words 'Snow Rescue' above and below the cross in big white letters.&nbsp; Across the bottom of the square in slightly smaller letters were three phone numbers which were labeled, Office, Lift Area, and Emergency."

"What are you going to do?" snorted Julie, "Call and say you have an emergency case of the hornies and need those two hunks on snowmobiles to come to your rescue."

"I've heard worse pickup lines," said Joan.

Julie responded, "Now that I think of it, those two guys last night looked pretty good.&nbsp; I wouldn't mind calling Snow Rescue for them to come help me with my hornies.&nbsp; Sara is nice, but I really need a man, and I was hoping there might be some action up here."

Sara, meanwhile, finished serving breakfast and joined them at the table.

When the conversation lulled into an extended period of quiet, Julie looked over at Judy's stiff nipples and commented, "I didn't realize so much cold air drifted over here from the patio doors.&nbsp; Maybe we should close the blinds."

"You three are making me feel naked," responded Judy.&nbsp; 

"You are naked," snorted Julie.
"I forgot jammies or a nightshirt.&nbsp; OK?&nbsp; And my underwear is not really comfortable to sleep in.&nbsp; I'm the least dressed one here.... I know.&nbsp; Let's change the subject."
"If it would make you more comfortable, I could take off my nightshirt," offered Sara.&nbsp; "Then you wouldn't be the least dressed one."

Judy didn't say anything, but Sara stood, reached up, pulled her long T-shirt up over her head, and then sat back down naked.&nbsp; "There, now you aren't the least dressed one here."

Joan laughed softly, shook her head and said, "Let's just finish breakfast, shall we.&nbsp; We did come up here to ski, after all, and we have a chance to ski all day on the slopes by ourselves today.&nbsp; Once they get the highway back open, this place will be packed."

The girls followed Joan's advice, completed breakfast and got dressed for skiing.&nbsp; As they were getting their coats and parkas out of the closet, Sara stopped, walked over to the end table by the couch and picked up something.&nbsp; It was her "J J J" collar.

"You won't need that on the slopes," said Joan.

"It isn't just a symbol for sex or servitude for me," said Sara in a soft voice that seemed to be full of emotion.&nbsp; "The Three J's are my masters and my protectors.&nbsp; This makes me feel close and protected.&nbsp; You guys have a lot more experience than I do.&nbsp; I am pretty much a Snow Bunny, and we will be going down the main hills.&nbsp; I'm relying on you to protect me."

"Don't worry, Sara Bunny," answered Joan.&nbsp; "I will protect you from any big bad wolves we meet on the way.&nbsp; And don't worry.&nbsp; The slope behind us is actually an intermediate slope, so you should be OK.&nbsp;&nbsp; The black diamond slope for the really serious skiers is on the other side of the mountain."

Sara pressed her lips together in thought and said, "I'll still wear my collar.&nbsp; It won't show under my ski mask anyway." 

A few minutes later the four girls were putting on their skis in the back yard and preparing to head down the slope.

Joan gave some final instructions.&nbsp; "Now remember, all you have to do to get to the chair lifts is stay on this path until it merges into the main slopes.&nbsp; There isn't really anywhere else you can go, so that will be easy."

"When we want to come back to the cabin, we need to turn off the main slope about one-third of the way down.&nbsp;&nbsp; That is the easy turn, and there is a big blue sign that says 'Parallel Slope.'&nbsp; It's so big because it used say something like 'Reserved for Snowboarders and other Non- skiers' but now they let the boarders go anywhere."

"The hard part is the path that leads to this cabin.&nbsp;&nbsp; The sign is smaller, brown, and just has an image of a cabin and an arrow.&nbsp; I'll remind you of all this again when we come back to the cabin for lunch."

The next two hours were heavenly skiing.&nbsp; The powder was fresh and there was absolutely no crud on the slopes.&nbsp; When they rode the chairs to the top they could see no one else on the slope beneath them.&nbsp; In fact, they could clearly see the trail of their skis from the previous run

Joan took that as an opportunity to instruct Sara on her skiing.&nbsp; "You see where the lines are clear as you turn?&nbsp; You are carving exactly right there.&nbsp; But over there where everything is all mixed up you were skidding or slipping pretty badly and you shouldn't have been at such low speed on such good snow.&nbsp; It's all in how you bend your legs and where you put your body weight.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'll show you before we start down for out next run."

A little before noon, the girls decided it was time to go back to the cabin for lunch.&nbsp; "I want to try something," said Sara.&nbsp; "I may never get a chance to try this again, but the slopes are empty except for us.&nbsp; They don't even have attendants at the ski lifts."

The Three J's looked at her waiting to hear what it was that she wanted.&nbsp; She smiled broadly at all three of them and said, "I want to ski back to the cabin naked."

"Go girl," yelled Judy.

"You are absolutely crazy," added Julie.

Joan, looking like she was thinking seriously about something, advised, "Keep the ski mask on.&nbsp; There might be security or safety cameras on the slopes or someone might come by with a cell phone.&nbsp; You don't want to be a viral video on YouTube... or worse."

Sara nodded and Joan continued, "Judy, you have a back pack, so you can carry her clothes.&nbsp; Julie, you lead.&nbsp; Sara and I will bring up the back.&nbsp; Remember it's a big blue sign to the parallel slope, and a little brown sign to the cabin.&nbsp; Got it?"

Everyone nodded and they walked over to beneath the deck of the closed lodge for Sara to strip off and get ready.&nbsp; 

"Are you really sure you want to do this?" asked Joan.

In reply, Sara slipped off her ski pants and long underwear and handed them to Judy to put in her back pack.&nbsp; After she was naked except for her mask, she put her boots back on and yelled excitedly, "Let's go!"&nbsp; A few moments later, the four of them started off down the slope.

The combination of warm noontime sun and cold air was exhilarating for all four girls, but especially for Sara who could feel both the sun and the cold wind on her bare skin.&nbsp; Her nipples were tightening and extending and she could feel an especial chill between her legs as the moisture which was forming on the lips of her sex evaporated in the cold, dry air that swept past them.

Julie began carving to the right and Judy followed her.&nbsp; Sara could see the big "Parallel Slope" sign and kept her skis in the tracks the other two girls had made.&nbsp; The turn for the second sign, however, wasn't so smooth.&nbsp; Julie didn't see the cabin trail sign far enough in advance and had to turn sharply to make the turn.&nbsp; Judy, who was following Julie, was caught even more off guard and began skidding badly as her skis broke loose in the tight turn.

Sara didn't have a chance.&nbsp; Once her skis broke loose, she didn't have the experience to recover and didn't know enough to 'drop to stop,' so she ended up straightening back out, and then, totally out of control, she went french frying straight down the slope, rapidly gaining speed.&nbsp; Joan, running behind her, retained control, but chose to follow Sara down the slope, calling out to her to cut and zig to slow herself down.

Sara regained control, and several very long minutes later, they were at the bottom of the slope just above the entrance to the chair lift.

"What now?" asked Sara.

"No choice," Answered Joan.&nbsp; "We have to go back up on the chair lift and then ski back down to the cabin."

Sara looked like she was about to cry.

"Good thing you kept the ski mask on." said Joan.&nbsp; "There are security cameras on the chair lift.&nbsp; Probably nobody watching them today, but you never know... they might be recording.&nbsp; Or, we might run into somebody up at the lodge.&nbsp; In any case, as soon as we get off the lift, head back down the slope."

Sara just nodded her head.&nbsp; Then she said softly, "I'm scared."

"You'll be alright," assured Joan.&nbsp; "Your face is covered and there's noone here to see you."

"No, that's not it," cried Sara, "I don't care if people see me naked, but if we get in trouble, you could get kicked out of school or not be able to get into the fancy schools you need for your masters and doctorate."

"Let me worry about that," answered Joan.&nbsp; "Let's just get my naked little friend-slave back to the cabin."

Joan helped Sara onto the lift and sat beside her.&nbsp; As soon as their feet left the ground she felt the cold of the seat coming through her ski pants and wished that she had taken off her jacket and let Sara use it to sit on.

Sara started to shiver.
"Are you alright?" asked Joan.

"My fire is going out," answered Sara, "I'm getting cold."

"If they're recording the security and safety cams, this is going to make one hell of a video," muttered Joan, and she took off her gloves and reached over to Sara.&nbsp; With one hand she stroked Sara's breasts as her other hand slid between Sara's legs.&nbsp; Sara moaned softy and seemed to relax, but her flesh felt like ice beneath Joan's hands.

Finally they got to the top and Joan pulled Sara from the chair.&nbsp; Sara seemed slightly dazed as they moved over toward the slope.&nbsp; Joan had seen something like this before.&nbsp; Sara was in the very early stages of hypothermia.&nbsp; The cold metal of the chair had sucked too much warmth out of Sara's body and her body temperature was getting critically low.

They started down the slope with Sara only slightly ahead of Joan.&nbsp; "Big sign!" yelled Joan.&nbsp; Sara responded by weakly nodding her head, and they turned onto the parallel slope.

Joan was worried.&nbsp; Sara was now wobbling slightly on her skis.&nbsp;&nbsp; Joan couldn't risk leaving her side, but at the same time couldn't risk not being ahead of her so Sara could follow her at the turn.&nbsp; Sara would never see the sign.&nbsp; She had to get ahead of her.&nbsp; But what if Sara didn't turn behind her?

Joan was just starting to move slightly ahead when she saw them.&nbsp; Two orange snowmobiles parked sideways on the parallel slope.&nbsp; Their yellow strobe lights were flashing and two people in red snowmobile suits were standing in front them waving their arms pointing onto the trail to the cabins.

Sara nodded her head weakly and turned with Joan onto the side trail.&nbsp;&nbsp; As they approached the cabin, Joan could hear the whine of the snowmobile engines behind them.

"Get her into the hot tub," yelled Joan as they reached the deck.&nbsp; The two snow rescue people grabbed Sara and easily lifted her out of her skis, out of her boots, and up the steps.&nbsp;&nbsp; One of them pulled her ski mask off and the two of them began to lower her into the tub.

Joan dropped into the tub to support her.&nbsp; Somehow she had shed her clothing as she climbed the steps and crossed the deck.&nbsp; Joan unwrapped the collar from Sara's neck and flipped it up onto one of the deck chairs.

"How are you feeling," asked one of the men.

"OK... " responded Sara slowly with a slurred voice.&nbsp; Then the warmth of the water hit her and she seemed to perk up.&nbsp; She looked up at the Snow Rescue people and added, "...more than OK, fine - mighty fine,"

The young man blushed slightly to hear his own words from last night echoed back at him.&nbsp; Sara looked up at him again and continued,&nbsp; "Thank you for your help."&nbsp; Then turning to Joan she said, "I think I found the limit of my fire."

"What?" asked the young man.

Sara, now apparently almost totally back to herself, smiled at him and said, "Judy would like your name and number so she can call you when it isn't an emergency."
She looked over at the other man dressed in red and added, "Julie would probably like your name and number also if you're available for the next few days."

He answered, "We are scheduled until 5:00 this afternoon when the lifts shut down, but we're all your's after that.&nbsp; My name is Kevin."

"And mine is Ron," added the other.

Sara looked up at Judy and said "Judy, meet Ron."

And then she looked over to Julie, "Julie, meet Kevin."

Looking at Judy and Julie, she added, "I'll use one of the downstairs bedrooms tonight so you two can screw you heads off if things work out."&nbsp; Then she gave all of them a very lopsided grin.

"She is still showing some effects of hypothermia," said Ron.&nbsp; "I'm in pre-med and an EMT.&nbsp; I've seen this before when someone is out on the slopes too long in really cold weather&nbsp; She will be OK in an hour or so, especially if she stays in the hot tub for a while, but right now it's like she is as drunk as if she had just finished off a bottle of wine."

"Amazing what a bottle of wine can start," sighed Judy.

"I will also sleep downstairs tonight," said Joan, and then as Julie began to turn bright red, she added, "to keep watch over Sara... and in case you need some privacy."

She paused and went on in a quieter voice, "Right now, Sara and I need some privacy while she warms up in here.&nbsp; I don't want to leave her alone for now, and we seem to be the only two naked people here, so it's a bit uncomfortable with all of you standing around up there."

"Not for me," chirped Sara.&nbsp; I could be naked in front of anyone, anytime.&nbsp; Remember?"

"That's the hypothermia talking, " said Ron.

"Don't bet on it," laughed Julie, as she grabbed onto Kevin's arm and said to him,&nbsp; "Before you go back to work, I do want your phone number."&nbsp; With that, she pulled him into the cabin.&nbsp; Judy and Ron followed and left Sara and Joan alone in the hot tub.

As they left, Joan called after them, "I want that number also.&nbsp; I have a special favor to ask of you two for later."

After they had gone inside and closed the patio doors, Sara stood up and looked into Joan's eyes.&nbsp; "I'm fine," she said.&nbsp; "And this isn't the hypothermia or the wine or anything else talking.&nbsp; If you hadn't relit my fire on the chair lift, I wouldn't have made it.&nbsp; Let me return the favor and maybe get both of us totally warmed back up.&nbsp; We could even do a 'Hottie,'"

"What's a Hottie," asked Joan.
"A quickie in a hot tub," answered Sara as her mouth closed over Joan's.

Joan heard a light rumbling noise and looked up to see the blinds being drawn across the patio doors that opened onto the deck.&nbsp; She pushed down with her arms so that she raised out of the hot tub and sat on the deck.&nbsp;&nbsp; As she did so, Sara's mouth trailed down her body.&nbsp; She lay back and let Sara light the fire between her legs.&nbsp; Sara stroked her thighs and ran her hands down the inside and outsides of her legs as she licked and nibbled on her labia and sucked lightly on her throbbing clit.

Both were back in the hot tub about fifteen minutes later when Ron, Judy, Kevin and Julie came back out onto the deck.

"We have to get back on duty," said Ron, but we will definitely see you tonight."

"Oh, you will!" answered Joan.&nbsp; Judy and Julie looked over at her as she added, "Trust me, you will DEFINITELY see us tonight."

A few moments later the two snowmobiles whined out of the yard and Julie said, "Are you two going to stay in the hot tub all day or are we going to eat lunch and get back out on the slopes.&nbsp; They are shutting down the lifts early so we only have a couple more hours."

"I've already eaten," answered Sara with a giggle, "but I probably should get some food, too.&nbsp; She and Joan dissolved in laughter as Judy and Julie turned to go back into the cabin.

 = = = =

An hour later they were back on the slopes.&nbsp; Sara's skill improved dramatically with each run, and by late afternoon, she was even doing "mogul jumps" over small hills on the slope.&nbsp; Around 4:30 Joan announced, "This is our last downhill run for today.&nbsp; With the lodge closed, they are shutting everything down at five o'clock."

The Three J's and an S raced each other down the slope.&nbsp; When they got to the bottom, Joan said, "When we get back to the top, let's meet over by the lodge deck.&nbsp; There's something I have to show you."

Julie and Judy looked at her with questions apparent on their faces.&nbsp; Sara, who rarely questioned anything The Three J's were doing, just walked over to the lift and waited for Joan to join her for the ride up.

When they got to the top, the three of them followed Joan over to the deck.&nbsp; "What do you want to show us," asked Julie.&nbsp; 

"Wait 'til the lifts shut off," she responded.

A few moments later, the whir and clank of the chair lift slowly ground to a halt.

"So what is it?" asked Judy.

"This," answered Joan, as she pulled her suitcase out from under the deck.&nbsp; "I had Ron and Kevin bring it up here.&nbsp; They will take it back down to the cabin for us when the get off duty... which is now."

"What's that for?" asked Judy and Julie together.

"Your clothes," answered Joan.&nbsp; "Or more accurately, our clothes.&nbsp; We failed Sara this morning when she was depending on us, and this is our way of making it up to her.&nbsp; If you enjoy it, consider it a chance to participate in her pleasure.&nbsp; If you don't like it, consider it a punishment for letting her down, but you are going down that slope like she did this morning - wearing nothing but your boots and ski mask."

"Oh well," answered Julie with a shrug.&nbsp; "It's like Sara said, we may never get this chance again.&nbsp; Who knows, I might like it."

"You'll NEVER like it as much as Sara," added Judy.&nbsp; "But it's hard to pass up the opportunity to do something this crazy."

Soon all four girls were packing their ski pants, parkas, and underwear into the suitcase.

Julie looked down the slope and said, "We'd better be sure we don't miss the turn this time.&nbsp; With no chair lift, we would have to herring bone our way back up to the turn, and that would be a LOT of work."

"Don't worry about it," answered Joan.&nbsp; "I've taken care of that."

Sara yelped, "Let's go!" and all four started down the slope.

The sun was low in the sky so there was no warmth on their bodies as they sped downhill.&nbsp; Their nipples puckered in the cold air.&nbsp; But Sara was not the only one who felt the extra coolness of moisture evaporating off the lips of her sex.

They carved left together onto the parallel slope and soon Julie and Judy were straining to catch sight of the small brown sign which marked the turn onto the secondary trail.&nbsp;&nbsp; Joan signaled Sara to slow down slightly and let the others get ahead of them.&nbsp; She wondered why until she saw the flashing yellow strobe lights up ahead.&nbsp; Ron was standing in the middle of the slope waving them into the trail.&nbsp;&nbsp; Kevin was standing along side him holding a digital video camera.

"Whoooaaahh!" screamed Sara and she raised her arms high holding her ski poles almost over her head as she and Joan passed the camera.&nbsp; As they zoomed down the trail, they could hear the snowmobiles revving up behind them.&nbsp; Soon the flashing strobes passed them and headed toward the cabin.&nbsp;&nbsp; When they arrived, the snowmobiles were parked in the yard and Kevin was standing on the top of the steps to the deck with the video camera.

"Put your skis in the racks," yelled Joan, and Judy and Julie scurried to get their skis put away so they could hurry up the steps onto the deck.&nbsp; Joan put her skis on the rack and walked calmly up the stairs.&nbsp; Sara racked her skis, took off her boots and threw them up onto the deck.&nbsp; Then she walked barefoot and bare assed out in the snow to retrieve a couple of bottles of wine from the case on the picnic table.

She held them up for the camera and danced around Rocky style with them above her head for a few moments.&nbsp; Then she pressed one to each of her breasts and walked with an exaggerated swinging of her hips over to the deck and up the steps.&nbsp; As soon as she had passed Kevin, Ron yelled, "Cut." and Kevin lowered his camera.

Julie and Judy had run into their bedrooms and returned wearing their short robes.&nbsp; Evidently, they left the boots and ski masks in the bedrooms.&nbsp; Joan put her boots and ski mask on one of the tables on the deck and lowered herself into the hot tub.&nbsp; Sara picked up Joan's boots and mask and carried them into the house.&nbsp; When she returned, she was wearing nothing but her collar and was carrying a tray with six full wine glasses on it.

"Why don't you all relax out here on the deck, and I will fix us something for supper," she said as she set down the tray.&nbsp; She then picked up one of the glasses and went back into the kitchen.

"I think we are a little over dressed," said Ron as he began to unzip his red snowmobile suit.&nbsp; Beneath the suit he was wearing a light gray track suit.&nbsp; Kevin had a similar track suit in light blue.

After he and Kevin had removed their suits, Sara reappeared beside them and held out her arms.&nbsp; "I'll put those in the living room closet," she said.&nbsp; "The boots will be on a rug just inside the patio doors.&nbsp; Dinner will be ready in a little while.&nbsp; In the meantime, if you need more wine, let me know."

Ron and Kevin sat down in the deck chairs and picked up one of the glasses of wine.&nbsp; Judy sat next to Ron and Julie sat next to Kevin.

"What are you going to do with your video," asked Julie.
"My camera, my video!" yelled Joan from the hot tub.&nbsp; "I will make sure that no faces or identifiers are on it and then it is getting posted through a techno-geek I know who has accounts everywhere.&nbsp; Nobody will know who it is except Ron, Kevin, The Three J's and Sara.&nbsp; Within hours, we will be the unknown ski streakers on hundreds of websites.&nbsp; Who knows, it might truly go viral and we will be anonymously famous."

"You can't be both," said Judy as she drained her glass.

Ron said, "We'd better save some of that wine for after dinner."

She pointed out at the box barely visible in the snow, laughed and answered, "There's another case under that one.&nbsp; If we need more wine, we will just send Sara back out to get some."

"Is she your servant?&nbsp; I thought she was your friend." asked Kevin.

"It's kind of complicated," answered Joan.&nbsp; "Sara is definitely our friend, but sometimes she is our friend-friend, and sometimes she is our servant-friend and sometimes she is our slave-friend and lately sometimes she is our slut-slave-friend."

"And I think for Joan," added Julie, "she is also lately becoming a love-slave-friend."

"Like I said," responded Joan, "It's kind of complicated."

"Are you two lovers?" asked Kevin, pointing to Julie and Judy.&nbsp; The disappointment was obvious in his voice and on his face.

"They are omnivores who lean heavily toward men," answered Joan.

"Very heavily," added Julie.&nbsp; Then looking directly in Kevin's deep brown eyes, "Especially hunks who are planning to become doctors."

"I, on the other hand," explained Joan, "am an alpha omnivore who leans a little bit toward my own gender."&nbsp; She paused and continued, "Lately a LOT toward my own gender."

"Dinner's ready!" came the call from inside.

Rod and Judy, Kevin and Julie got up to go inside.&nbsp; Sara came out onto the deck carrying a towel and Joan's robe.&nbsp; She was still naked except for her collar.&nbsp; A few moments later Joan and Sara joined the others in the kitchen.

"If it makes any of you uncomfortable, I will put on a robe, but as you may have figured out by now, being naked in public turns me on almost as much as being a good servant for The Three J's."

"Fine by me," answered Ron.
"I'm good with it," added Kevin.

"I'll get naked for you later," whispered Julie to Kevin.&nbsp; But since everyone else had stopped talking at that point, her whisper could be heard by everyone.

"Ditto," said Judy to Ron.

Both Ron and Kevin looked slightly flustered.&nbsp; Sara spoke up, "The Three J's are very powerful women who say what they want and want exactly what they say they want.&nbsp; You two look like you can handle it or they wouldn't have invited you.&nbsp; Besides, they only need one submissive servant, and that's me."

Pointing to her collar she explained, "Three J's and an S.&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm the S.&nbsp; That's Sara, Servant, Slave, Slut, Sister, or whatever they and I want it to be.&nbsp; Sometimes its even 'Spokeswoman' because I have absolutely no shame and can say anything to anybody - whether I am dressed, naked, or somewhere in between."

"I think the somewhere in between is what the rest of us are looking for," said Joan.&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ron and Kevin, I will get you guys some robes."

"From where?" asked Julie?

"In case you hadn't noticed, there are three drawers in the wall between the closets in each bedroom.&nbsp; There are six people who own this cabin and time share it.&nbsp; The drawers are to store stuff while you are not here."

"Although each of the drawers is supposed to belong to one of the owners, The stuff in the upstairs drawers is basically available to anyone.&nbsp; There are sheets, towels, robes, pajamas and nightshirts was well as some shampoo and stuff like that.&nbsp; The agreement is that if you use someone else's stuff, you clean it and put it back or you replace it if it is something that gets used up."

"NOW you tell me about the pajamas," said Judy, over acting as though she were deeply hurt.

A few moments later Joan returned carrying two tartan-patterned flannel robes and handed them to Ron and Kevin.&nbsp; "After supper, you can change in the bathroom or one of the bedrooms, and then join us out on the deck.&nbsp; I put a few items from the 'Cougar Cache' in the pockets in case you need them tonight."

"What's the Cougar Cache" asked Ron.

"Mom's two younger sisters have a sixth of the cabin.&nbsp; They never married.&nbsp; They're both college professors out east.&nbsp; They do NOT come here to ski.&nbsp; Their main interest is the skiing instructors and college students.&nbsp; They always say, 'The law doesn't say we can't fuck students.&nbsp; It just says we can't fuck OUR students."
"Mandy and Sandy?" asked Kevin.

"You've met them?"

"No, but I was warned about them.&nbsp; I was told they were pretty foxy for older women, but that they could probably wear out a jack hammer in a week."

"I don't know about that," answered Joan, "but they always come prepared with several boxes of condoms in various types and flavors, and what they don't use, they throw into their drawer.&nbsp; There must be about a case and a half of condoms accumulated in there.&nbsp; Mom always complained that they should keep them locked up in the basement like the Jurgensen's do their toys, but they never did."

"The Jurgensen's toys?" asked Judy.

"A whole different story - different owners," answered Joan.&nbsp; "When we were little, Mandy and Sandy got into the drawers in the downstairs bedrooms and when mom came downstairs there were whips and chains and cuffs and dildoes and about everything else you could imagine scattered all across the floor.&nbsp; Mom called Mr Jurgensen to yell at him, but he said he didn't care if the girls - or anyone else - played with their toys.&nbsp; It was all dishwasher safe anyway and could be cleaned up after use."

"Next time we came out here, there was a lock on the drawer, but after that, the first day we were here, Mom always ran the dishwasher empty a few times with bleach in it.&nbsp; I think Mandy and Sandy still borrow the toys once in a while to use on their boy toys or on each other.&nbsp; The key to the lock hangs under the deck."

"Food first.&nbsp; Fun and games later," interrupted Sara.&nbsp; "Have a seat at the table, I'm going out to get another bottle of wine."

As Sara walked out into the snow, The Three J's, Ron and Kevin seated themselves around the kitchen table.

The six sat around the table as if they were three couples - Kevin and Julie, Ron and Judy, and Joan and Sara.&nbsp; After they had finished dinner, Sara asked, "Would anyone like any dessert?"

Julie said to Kevin, "I think we should wait until later for some desert."
Judy poked Ron and said, "Yeah, I'll give you your dessert later, too."

Ron laughed, Kevin blushed slightly, and Julie turned bright red.&nbsp; "That's not what I meant," she stammered.&nbsp; I just thought we could spend some time out on the heated deck for a while before we ate... No, I mean I'm full for now but would have room for something later...&nbsp; I mean... "

Judy rolled her eyes.&nbsp; Joan said with a laugh, "Julie, when you get to the bottom of the hole, quit digging."

"Then I guess we are ready to go out on the deck for a while," interjected Sara.&nbsp; "You guys go on out and I will clean up the kitchen.&nbsp; I'll take the empty bottles back out to the case and join you in a little while."

Ron and Kevin went over to the bedrooms to change into their robes.&nbsp; Joan went out onto the deck, shed her robe, and walked down into the hot tub.&nbsp; Judy dropped her robe on one of the chairs and joined her.&nbsp; Julie, however, pulled her robe tight around her, sat down in one of the chairs and said, "I'll wait for Kevin here."

"Is Julie getting shy?" asked Judy?

Joan leaned in closer to her and answered quietly, "Maybe she is seriously attracted to Kevin and doesn't want to blow it and ruin the relationship."

"I'm seriously attracted to Ron," replied Judy, "But I think that if I blow it, it will strengthen the relationship."

"You two!" snapped Julie.&nbsp; "Just because I don't throw myself at a man cunt first, it doesn't mean that I'm shy or sexually repressed."

"I've never tried that," snorted Judy,"I'm definitely going to have to try that some day."

Julie was frowning with her arms crossed, and Joan and Judy were laughing heavily as Ron and Kevin came out onto the deck.&nbsp; "Did I miss something?" asked Ron.

"No," stuttered Judy through her laughter, "I haven't tried it yet."

Julie groaned loudly.&nbsp; Both Judy and Joan relapsed into fits of laughter.

Ron looked at Kevin and shrugged his shoulders.&nbsp; Sara, walking up behind them said, "Just pretend you are on a roller coaster."

"What?" said Kevin.

"Trying to keep up with The Three J's is like riding a big roller coaster.&nbsp; It can get fast and sometimes it can get scary, but as long as it doesn't go too far off track, the best thing is to just relax and enjoy the ride."

In response, Judy and Joan both raised their hands above their heads like they were at the top of a roller coaster hill and then both yelled loudly and, mimicking the bouncing of a roller coaster,&nbsp; submerged themselves beneath the water as they went "down hill."

"I don't do real well on roller coasters," muttered Kevin.

"Then you just sit this ride out," answered Julie from behind him.&nbsp; "I'm more of a merry-go- round person myself."

As Kevin turned to sit with Julie, Joan and Judy both bounced slowly up and down in the water mimicking riding carrousel horses.&nbsp; Julie stuck out her tongue at them. 

"I'm from Ohio," said Ron, "and I've ridden The Maverick at Cedar Point and the Son of the Beast at King's Island.... never threw up.... never peed myself... and I kept getting back in line to ride again.&nbsp; You can't scare me."

With that he set his robe on one of the chairs and slipped into the water with Joan and Judy.

"Be with you in a minute," said Sara as she walked down the steps carrying an empty bottle.&nbsp; The Three J's paid no attention to her, but Ron and Kevin both watched her walk barefoot and naked through the snow to place the empty in the case and then return to the deck.&nbsp; She went inside and shortly returned with another empty for a second trip out into the snow.&nbsp; A third and fourth trip with an empty bottle followed.

After returning to the deck from her fourth trip, Sara asked, "Would anyone like more wine?"

A chorus of "Yes" greeted her.

"Be right back," she chirped and went for a fifth time back out into the snow.&nbsp; When she got to the buried boxes, she dug with her hands until she had released the top box.&nbsp; After setting it on top of&nbsp; the snow, she bent down and pulled open the lower case.&nbsp; In a few minutes she was once again coming up the steps to the deck, this time carrying a full bottle of wine which was pressed tightly to one of her nipples.

Ron watched her walk into the house with the bottle and asked, "How is she not in a constant state of hypothermia?"

"She has an intense inner fire," answered Joan.

"And Joan is her favorite fireman," giggled Judy.

Ron shook his head and said, "This is definitely an interesting roller coaster ride." 

"I think we are going to check out the Carousel," said Julie as she got up from her chair.&nbsp; Sara was just coming out onto the deck with a tray of wine.&nbsp; Julie grabbed two full glasses off the tray, held one out to Kevin, and asked, "You coming?"

Judy started to say something, but the intense glare from Julie silenced her, so instead she and Joan went back to mimicking riding horses on a merry-go-round.

Sara handed glasses of wine to Judy, Joan, and Ron and set her glass on the edge of the hot tub.&nbsp; Then she set the tray on one of the low tables and carefully set her collar in the middle of it.&nbsp; Finally, she walked down into the hot tub and sat next to Joan.&nbsp; As she did, Judy slid closer to Ron and leaned her head against his shoulder.

The four of them talked about the events of the day as they drank their wine.&nbsp; As the glasses were growing empty, Ron asked Sara a couple of questions about her "snow thing," but she seemed a little distracted in her answers.&nbsp; The distraction probably had something to do with the fact that one of Joan's hand was rubbing up and down the insides of her thighs, with her fingers grazing the entrance to her slit each time the hand passed over the top.&nbsp; Judy's hand went under the water and soon Ron was also showing a great deal of distraction.

When Sara started moaning softly, Joan said, "I think it's time that Sara and I went downstairs and gave you two some privacy.&nbsp; You have the whole deck and backyard to yourselves."

Sara gave one of her lopsided grins and said, "You could try a coolie to see if you like it."

Joan added, "Or maybe even a hottie."

"What's a coollie?" asked Judy.

"A quickie in a snow bank," answered Sara with a deep giggle.

"Then's what's a hottie?" asked Ron

Joan looked down at the water and then at Judy who had turned and straddled Ron's legs and was sliding up onto his lap.&nbsp; "Oh," he said.

Sara pointed toward the end of the deck.&nbsp; "Somebody has to get out of the water about every half hour to push the white button, or the bubbles stop and the water gets cooler."

"Don't worry," answered Judy.&nbsp; "We will keep the water hot and agitated."

"See you in the morning," replied Joan as she picked up her robe and walked inside.&nbsp; Sara picked up her collar and followed Joan down into the basement.

When they got downstairs, Joan asked, "You want to go with separate bedrooms, or do you want to share one?"
Joan pointed back and forth between the bedroom doors.&nbsp; Sara got that puppy dog look on her face and replied, "Which bedroom is the Jurgensen's toy drawer in?"

"The one on the right," answered Joan.&nbsp; "Let me show you where they keep the key."

With Sara following her, she opened the door to the area under the deck and stepped down onto the concrete floor.&nbsp; Then she turned around and pointed at the wall area above the door.&nbsp; There were six key hooks each labeled with a number.&nbsp; "The Jurgensen's drawer is drawer number four."

"Mandy's and Sandy's drawer," said Joan, pointing to the one empty hook, "is drawer number three, except it's not really a drawer any more.&nbsp; It's more of a little closet.&nbsp; I've always wondered what they keep in there, but no one has been able to find the key, so they must take it with them."

"I think I might know where that key is," said Sara, her eyes opening wide in sudden recognition of something.&nbsp; "When we were pulling all that snow in here the other night, we moved a couple of things out of the way, including that strange bench... or table... or whatever it is.&nbsp; I set it on its end to push it back behind the hot tub and when I pushed it, a little slide opened on the bottom side of it.&nbsp; There was a key in there."

Joan went over to the bench and set it up on end.&nbsp; "Push right there," said Sara, pointing to an odd looking knot in the wood.&nbsp; 

Joan pushed and a small cavity popped open.&nbsp; There was a key inside that was very similar to the keys which hung above the door.&nbsp; "Lets leave that exploration for another day," said Joan.&nbsp; "I think the contents of the Jurgensen's toy drawer will more than keep us busy tonight."

Both girls came back inside and went into the bedroom.&nbsp; "Let's see what we have here," said Joan as she unlocked the drawer and opened it.&nbsp; The drawer contained an impressive variety of chains, cuffs, whips, dildos and other toys which Joan began laying out on the bed.

"What is that?" asked Sara, as Joan placed a torpedo-shaped object with wires trailing from it on the bed.

"It's a dildo, silly," Joan replied.&nbsp; "Or an anal plug.&nbsp; It's shaped so it could be used for either.&nbsp; I thought you were familiar with those things."

"Not that plug in," answered Sara.&nbsp; "And what are the metal strips on the sides of it for."

"Just a minute," said Joan as she rummaged through the drawer.&nbsp; A few moments later she lay a small black box and several other devices with wires trailing from them on the bed.&nbsp; The box had four knobs on the front and two on the top.&nbsp; There were also two openings on the top that looked like they were small headphone jacks.&nbsp; "This plugs in here," she said as she connected the wires from the dildo to the control box. 

Holding up three, small circular bands an inch or so in diameter she set them aside and said, "We won't be needing these."

When Sara asked "Why?" she held the bands up by their wires and answered, "Just what part of your body would go through these donuts?"&nbsp; Then holding up a small curved cup with a long metal tube sticking out of it she added, "And what part of a man's body would this be for?"

"Oh," giggled Sara.&nbsp; She picked up a set of clamps with wires trailing from them and said.&nbsp; "I have a pretty good idea what part of the body these are intended for - at least on a woman."

"And these are for anywhere," said Joan as she held up several sets of stick-on electrode pads.&nbsp; Holding up the box, she added, "It looks like you can use any two at one time."

"Four," countered Sara, holding up a second, slightly different control box.

"Let's see," mused Joan.&nbsp; "We have several different types of paddles, two floggers, a whip, a couple of different blindfolds, a ring gag, two ball gags, some soft, black rope, leather cuffs, and.... eight lengths of chain with clips on both ends."&nbsp; She looked around the walls and ceiling and said, "Nope."&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the bed, another "Nope." 

Joan walked out into the larger room and looked around at the floor and walls and ceiling.&nbsp; "Aha," she finally shouted.&nbsp; "Sara, bring me those chains, please."

Sara brought the chains out to her and Joan pulled a chair over to under one of the beams that ran across the ceiling of the large room.&nbsp; There were five, large beams spaced about three feet apart with equally large beams supporting them on both the inside and outer walls.&nbsp;&nbsp; "These cabins were originally designed with these beams holding up the deck so the area under them would be totally clear with no posts.&nbsp; There was supposed to be patio doors going out into the back yard under the deck.&nbsp; It only took one winter for them to figure out that patio doors at ground level were not a good idea in an area that got eight to twelve feet of snow on a regular basis.&nbsp; They changed their plans before they built this cabin, but still used a cantilevered deck.&nbsp; After the original owner installed a hot tub, he closed in the deck anyway and put additional support posts under it, but the beams are still here.&nbsp; And it looks like the Jurgensens - or Sandy and Mandy - have taken advantage of that."

Joan took one of the shorter chains from Sara and clipped it to a large, black eyebolt that was screwed into the overhead beam.&nbsp; Soon four chains were hanging from the beams.&nbsp; Joan then attached the longer chains to eyebolts that were screwed into the support beams right at floor level.&nbsp; "Since Mr and Mrs Jurgensen couldn't both be chained up at the same time, the second set of eyebolts must be an addition by Sandy and Mandy.&nbsp; Come to think of it, Mom said something once about her sisters and the Jurgensens sharing weeks together up here.&nbsp; I wonder if it was Sandy and Mandy chained here or the Jurgensens?"

"Tonight it will be me," whispered Sara as she stood under the beam, lifted up her arms, and then spread her legs as wide as they would go."
"Go get the cuffs," ordered Joan, "and I will string you up."

Sara ran back into the bedroom and returned with two small and two large leather cuffs.&nbsp; The cuffs were padded on the inside with what looked like real sheep's wool.&nbsp; "These aren't dishwasher safe," said Joan, "as she wrapped the cuffs around Sara's wrists and ankles.&nbsp; Two inch wide Velcro straps held the cuffs firmly in place.

"Arms first," said Joan and Sara raised her arms above her head.&nbsp; Joan clipped the chains to D rings on the cuffs.&nbsp; "Now the legs," and Sara spread her legs wide.&nbsp; 

"Hmmm," muttered Joan.&nbsp; "Too long... unless.... ah, yes.&nbsp; These are double ended clips.&nbsp; I have the chains backwards.&nbsp; I should have the adjustable clip at the wall."&nbsp; She then reversed the floor chains and again clipped them to Sara's ankles.&nbsp; "Let me see how tight we can get those," she asked herself as she pulled on the chain and moved the double-ended clip in several links.&nbsp; After she had done that to both chains, Sara said, "I think that is tight enough.&nbsp; I can feel it pulling my legs wider than I want."

"Which means that you can't close your legs at all and I can do whatever I want between your legs and you can't stop me."&nbsp; Joan reached up and rubbed Sara between the legs.&nbsp; Sara sighed and closed her eyes.&nbsp; Her nipples darkened and her sex began to glisten.

"So, what should I use on you?"

"Do I have a choice," asked Sara.

"Not really," answered Joan, "But I'm open to suggestions."

"I've never tried electro-sex," said Sara.&nbsp; "I've read a little about it, but never tried it."

"Electro-sex it is, then."&nbsp; Joan went back into the bedroom and returned with the two control boxes and a handful of the accessories.&nbsp; Each of the boxes had a fabric belt on it.&nbsp; Joan wrapped one of the belts around Sara's waist so that the control box was in the center of her back.

Holding up a set of black plastic nipple clamp contacts, she said, "I think you know where these go," and then clipped one to each of Sara's stiff nipples.&nbsp; She then led the leads over Sara's shoulder and plugged them into the box.

"Here is our all purpose torpedo," said Joan with a sly grin.&nbsp; "First we have to lube it up."

Sara's eyes widened.&nbsp; "Yes, it's going back there," whispered Joan into Sara's ear.&nbsp; "But even if it were going up front, I would still lube it.&nbsp; The lube helps conduct electricity, and we want goooood electrical contact."

Sara grunted slightly as Joan wiggled the torpedo into her and then pulled the wire forward between her legs and over her shoulder to plug it into the control box.
"Let's test what we have so far," said Joan, and she turned one of the dials on the box.&nbsp; Nothing happened.&nbsp; "Shit," muttered Joan as she opened the battery compartment.&nbsp; "Oh well," she said to Sara, "There are always a bunch of nine volt batteries in the drawer up in the kitchen."&nbsp; As she started up the stairs, she added to herself, "And if there aren't, I'm taking them out of the fire alarms."

A few moments later Joan returned carrying four batteries.&nbsp; "One for each box and a spare for later," she explained to Sara.&nbsp;&nbsp; Sara could feel Joan moving the control box and inserting the battery.&nbsp; Then her nipples started to tingle.

"That's the lowest setting," said Joan.

The tingle became a sting.&nbsp; "That's about one third."

The sting began to change in frequency and fade in and out on a regular cycle.&nbsp; "There are all sorts of controls I could play with here, but I think I will just keep the frequency the same and have it fade in and out."&nbsp;&nbsp; Sara began to moan softly.

"And this is the butt plug," said Joan.&nbsp; "What you will feel there is mainly your muscles clenching down on the electrode.&nbsp; I can run that one pretty far up without it being painful."

Sara suddenly felt like the butt plug was fucking her.&nbsp; It wasn't moving, but the sensations as her anal sphincter tightened and released were almost like it were moving in and out.

"This one is definitely a female only device," said Joan as she held up the clear piece of curved plastic with two strips of metal on it and a long metal tube sticking out from it.&nbsp; She lubed it, including smearing some of the lube across the metal strips, and pressed it into Sara until it was tight against her pussy lips.&nbsp; She tied it securely in place like a thong bikini bottom.&nbsp; The two metal strips curved together at the top and just missed being directly over Sara's clit.

Joan connected the wires to the other tens unit and set it to three.&nbsp; Sara began to squirm and twist in her bonds, and soon was grunting and moaning loudly.&nbsp; "Tell me if this gets too intense," said Joan.&nbsp; Remember your safe word is&nbsp; summertime.'"

"No," grunted Sara.&nbsp; "I don't want a safe word tonight.&nbsp; Gag me or something so I can't say it.&nbsp; I want to totally put my trust in you and let you take me past my limits.&nbsp; I know you won't permanently hurt me.&nbsp; I want to know how far I can go."

"Are you sure?" asked Joan.

"Yes," answered Sara.&nbsp; "Yes!&nbsp; Do it!&nbsp; Gag me and take me as far as you want.&nbsp; I give myself totally to you."

"OK.&nbsp; If that's what you really want."&nbsp; Joan suddenly realized that the thought of Sara being totally under her control like this was causing her nipples to tighten and her slit to moisten.&nbsp; She took a deep breath and went back into the bedroom.

Joan came back with a red ball gag.&nbsp; "Open up," she said and inserted it in Sara's mouth, making sure that the safety air hole was not blocked.

"Close your eyes," she said and slid a black blindfold over Sara's eyes.&nbsp; Sara began swaying and moaning almost immediately.

What Sara could not now see was that Joan had slipped an identical vaginal stimulation cup on herself and was attaching it to the same tens unit which she now had belted around her own waist.

"Let's turn things up a little shall we," she said as she reached for the control box on Sara's waist.&nbsp; Joan turned up the anal plug to maximum.&nbsp; Sara took several very deep breaths as she accustomed herself to the intense sensations from her anal sphincter.&nbsp; Joan then turned the nipple clamps up a couple of clicks.

"Ugh, Ugh, Ugh," responded Sara as the tens unit rose and fell through its cycle.&nbsp; The "ugh's" changed to continuous "aaaah's" when Joan turned the control up further and to "eeee's" when the control reached maximum.&nbsp; Sara's hips began to thrust and grind as her inner fire rapidly caught up with the outer pain.

Joan turned the cunt-stim plate up several notches.&nbsp; Sara's thrust and grind became more frantic and sweat began to pour from her body.&nbsp; Her head was thrown back and she was thrashing it from side to side.

Joan picked up a long leather covered wooden paddle and met Sara's movements with a solid thwack on her ass as she thrust her hips backwards.&nbsp; Sara's "eeee's" became "iiiii's."&nbsp; To give Joan better access, she stood on her tiptoes and began raising her ass up as she pushed back before thrusting forward. 

Soon it was a ballet of pain as the electro-stims pulsed and Joan swung and Sara pushed and together they began climbing that explosive mountain toward an extreme orgasm.

Suddenly Sara went totally stiff and screamed loudly behind her gag, her arms quivering wildly in their chains.&nbsp; Joan dropped the paddle, reached to the tens unit on her belt and turned both controls to maximum.&nbsp; At the same time she grabbed Sara from the front and thrust her body against her.&nbsp; She was two or three inches taller than Sara when they were both standing straight upright, and with Sara's legs spread like they were, she had to bend her knees slightly between Sara's legs so that her pussy plate slammed against Sara's and her breasts and nipples pressed exactly against the shorter girl's.

Joan gasped as she felt the pulsing of Sara's nipple clamps which were now in contact with her own nipples.&nbsp; She reached up and tore off Sara's blindfold and gag and crushed her mouth with her own.&nbsp; With no gag Sara was very loud and Joan was not much quieter as they crashed through a first, second, third and finally a fourth orgasm, each more intense than the previous.

As the fourth orgasm finally began to fade, the pulses started to become painful and Joan reached down to the tens unit on her belt and opened the battery compartment.&nbsp; The battery fell to the floor and the pulses stopped.&nbsp; She reached behind Sara and did the same with her control unit.

Joan stood clinging to Sara.&nbsp; Both were trembling with the after energy of what had just occurred.&nbsp; After several moments, Joan reached up and released Sara's hands.&nbsp; Sara collapsed against her and Joan lowered her to the floor.&nbsp; After she released Sara's feet, she helped her stand back up.

"Do you want some wine?" asked Joan.

Sara shook her head no.

"Do you need to go out in the snow?"

Sara laughed and said, "I'd melt it."&nbsp; Then she turned and looked directly into Joan's eyes to say, "Just take me to bed and hold me.&nbsp; I think our fires joined together tonight."

Joan said nothing.&nbsp; She just held Sara by the waist to steady her and guided her back into the bedroom.

Joan was awakened by sunlight streaming through the top of the window directly onto her face.&nbsp; She looked sleepily at the glass and wondered why anyone would put a dark curtain across all but the top two inches of a window.&nbsp; Then she realized that the curtains were wide open and what she was looking at was the snow piled that deep against the front of the cabin.&nbsp; She found her robe at the foot of the bed and went upstairs to see who else was up.

Sara, naturally, had been up for quite a while and was standing in the kitchen putting away dishes from the night before.&nbsp;&nbsp; She was wearing a long T-shirt style nightshirt with a big image of "Hello Kitty" on the front.
"Don't you own any clothing that you didn't buy in the children's section," asked Joan with a laugh.

"Growing old is mandatory," replied Sara, "But growing up is optional."

Sara gave Joan a big grin and then yelled in the direction of the bedrooms, "Ron..., Kevin..., your note said make sure you were up by eight."

Ron and Kevin stumbled into the kitchen from the bedrooms.&nbsp; Both were wearing the robes Joan had provided for them the night before.&nbsp; Julie followed shortly thereafter.&nbsp; She was wearing her cotton pajamas.&nbsp; Judy came in last.&nbsp; Once again, she was wearing her black nightie.&nbsp; This morning, however, she had on a matching pair of very small bikini bottoms with ruffles on the back and a black micro bra, also with ruffles.&nbsp; The bra barely covered her areola, let alone her breasts.

"Worried about the cold this morning, are you," asked Julie with a snicker.&nbsp;&nbsp; Judy just stuck her tongue out at her and sat down.

"Coffee's ready," announced Sara.&nbsp; "I can do eggs, waffles, or pancakes.&nbsp; And you've got a choice of bacon or sausage. What does the group vote for?"

After some general murmuring, Joan announced, "It looks like pancakes and sausage wins this morning."

Judy looked over at Sara and asked, "Are you getting shy this morning?&nbsp; Or is there something that you don't want us to see?"

"What do you mean?" asked Sara.

"Well," said Julie.&nbsp; "It wasn't like we were snooping or listening in, but the crack of that paddle was pretty loud and either your favorite team won the Superbowl - FOUR TIMES - or you and Joan had some really fantastic S&amp;M sex last night."

Sara blushed slightly - something that she normally didn't do very easily - and replied.&nbsp; "I'm not hiding anything.&nbsp; If you want to see what my ass looks like this morning, here."&nbsp; She turned around and pulled up the back of her nightshirt.&nbsp; Her ass cheeks were still bright red with darker blue and purple splotches on them.

"I don't hide anything," she continued.&nbsp; "But I don't cook bacon or sausage in the nude.&nbsp; Some pain is just that - pain."&nbsp; She dropped her nightshirt back down over her bottom and turned to get ingredients out of the refrigerator.

Just then a low beep, followed by three high beeps and a warbling tone sounded from the pocket of Ron's robe.&nbsp; "Oh oh," said Ron.&nbsp; "We may have to gear up and head out."

He pulled a satellite cell phone from his pocket and answered with "Snow Rescue, this is Ron."&nbsp; He listened for a moment and then answered, "I think you know the answer to that sir.&nbsp; And I am very sure that I can speak for Kevin on that, too."&nbsp;&nbsp; After a pause, "OK, sir.&nbsp; We will bring e-kep and e-cass down here to cabin 19 with us and will be on standby from here."

He put the phone back in his pocket and looked around.&nbsp; "The plows can't bust through the drifts on the road, so they have to wait until they can get a blower from the state.&nbsp; It won't be available until late tonight or early tomorrow.&nbsp; Since the snow kept almost everyone from getting here and the resort is basically empty, they have decided to totally shut down the slopes and use the down time for mid-season inspection and maintenance on the chair lifts.&nbsp; The boss asked if Kevin and I would rather be on standby for emergencies or help with greasing the cables.&nbsp; That was a no- brainer."&nbsp; He smiled at everyone and finished, "You heard my answer.&nbsp; We will be on standby from here until they re-open the slopes."

"What is e-kept?" asked Julie.

Kevin laughed and answered, "e-kep... E-C-E-P.&nbsp; It stands for Extreme Conditions Extraction Pod.&nbsp; Basically it's a tube on a sled that you can pull behind a snowmobile.&nbsp; If someone breaks a leg or whatever, it protects them from the weather while you get them back to the lodge or to a road to meet an ambulance or to the aid station to wait for a helicopter."

Kevin looked over at Ron, and Ron continued the explanation.&nbsp; "E-cass is E-C-A-S, and that stands for Extreme Conditions Ambulance Sled.&nbsp; It is a miniature ambulance with a hand stretcher in it and room for an EMT to crawl in alongside someone.&nbsp; It bounces like mad, so there isn't much you can do in there except check vitals and make sure the IV's are working, but it means a severely injured person isn't riding by themselves in a glass coffin."

Julie raised her eyebrows and Ron added "That's how someone described the e-kep before we had e-cass available.&nbsp; I'm fully qualified for both units.&nbsp; Kevin is qualified on e-kep and has gotten halfway through the E-D-P-P tests for the e-cass."

"Too many letters," said Sara as she set a stack of pancakes on the table.&nbsp; "It makes it sounds like Kevin is half pregnant."

Kevin laughed.&nbsp; "I have to show that I can tow the sled properly Empty, with a Dummy in it, with a real Person in it, and with a Pair in it."

"He's done empty and with a dummy.&nbsp; Since I am instructor qualified, I get to be the person and then one-half of the pair," said Ron.&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe we can find time for Kevin to complete his certification tests today or tomorrow.&nbsp; After breakfast we will run up to the aid station and pick up the units and stop by our cabin for some overnight stuff.&nbsp;&nbsp; Judy, if you want, you can ride along with me, and if Julie wants, she can ride along with Kevin."

"Are we allowed to ride along on the resort's snowmobiles?"

"The snowmobiles belong to Ron and I," answered Kevin.&nbsp; "As long as we aren't actually on a rescue run, we can have passengers ride along.&nbsp; Unless, you are there for a reason, however, you can't ride in the sleds."

"Oh drat," said Judy with a grin.&nbsp; "I was really looking forward to riding in a glass coffin."

After breakfast Ron and Kevin and Judy and Julie all got dressed and prepared to head out on the snowmobiles.&nbsp; "Are you sure you two will be OK here alone for most of the day," asked Kevin.

"We'll find something to do," answered Joan.&nbsp;&nbsp; 

A few minutes later the two snowmobiles were whining their way up the slope toward the lodge.&nbsp; Sara cleaned up the table and stacked the dishes into the dishwasher.&nbsp; Then she turned to Joan and said, "You know what I would REALLY like to do today?"

"What?"

"Sleeeeeeeeeeeep." answered Sara.&nbsp; "Last night was new and exciting and wonderful and fabulous, but this morning I am TIRED!"

"It takes a lot to burn the fires that hot," said Joan.&nbsp; "I will probably lay down for a while myself."

"Separate bedrooms," said Sara.&nbsp; "No offense, but my mind is really telling me that I have to get some sleep and I don't want my body overruling my mind...... again... (lopsided grin) ... for now."

Joan swatted Sara lightly on the butt and "You take the bedroom on the left.&nbsp; Then you won't hear the Jurgensen's toys calling to you either.&nbsp;&nbsp; I will stay up here and fall asleep watching TV."

Sara yawned and walked over to the stairway to the basement.&nbsp; "Wake me up at three or when they get back." She loudly yawned again as she walked down into the basement.

Joan was asleep on the couch in the living room when the roaring whine of snowmobiles in the back yard woke her.&nbsp; It was almost four.&nbsp; Joan ran to the steps and yelled down into the basement,&nbsp; "Sara, I'm sorry I didn't wake you, but it's four o'clock and they're back."

A voice from the kitchen answered, "That's OK Joan, I have a built-in alarm clock in my head and have been up here since a little after three."

Joan laughed and asked, "Then why didn't you wake me?"

"You looked like you needed the sleep, and besides, I didn't know how much junk TV you watched before you fell asleep."

Ron and Judy, Kevin and Julie came in through the doors to the deck.&nbsp; They were each carrying their boots, which they set on the rug next to the patio doors.&nbsp; Ron and Kevin were also carrying small overnight bags.
"They gave us a tour of the whole resort," bubbled Julie.

"It's immense," added Judy.&nbsp; "And they couldn't even take us up on the snowmobile trails through the woods because they're on duty."

"The snow is kind of tricky up there sometimes, and it wouldn't look good if the on duty snow rescue team had to call for rescue." said Ron.

"Talked to the boss," said Kevin.&nbsp; "The state blower should be here sometime after midnight.&nbsp; With any luck they should have the highway open by this time tomorrow.&nbsp; That means the lodge will be open the day after that."

"So, we get at least another night and day together here with nothing to do?" said Joan.

"I wouldn't say&nbsp; nothing,'" answered Ron, "but yes the lodge and the slopes will remained closed for now."

"Why don't you two guys go change," said Julie, "while Judy and I bring the rest of our group up to date on what's happening."

The two young men hung their snowmobile suits in the closet and wandered back toward the bedrooms.&nbsp; Judy looked slightly confused, but refrained from saying anything until the guys were out of earshot.&nbsp; She then looked at Julie and said "What!?"

"I've got to make this quick because I don't want Kevin to hear," began Julie, "But could you guys come up with some reason for all four of you to go downstairs early tonight so Kevin and I can have the deck and hot tub all to ourselves.&nbsp; He's sweet and special and..."

"Shy," interjected Judy.

"Let's just say he isn't as comfortable with his body... with being naked in front of others... as some of us are.&nbsp; I really think he might be&nbsp; Mr Right,' and I don't want to mess this up."&nbsp; She looked from face to face and then added, "Please?"

"There are eight chains in the Jurgensen's toy drawer," said Sara.

It was Julie's turn to say "What?"

But Joan merely smiled broadly and said, "What she means is&nbsp; got it covered.'&nbsp; Judy, you are going to suggest that we explore some group B&amp;D.&nbsp; Let's see how high a roller coaster Ron is ready for."

Judy commented,&nbsp; "I've always wanted to try a little bondage, but never met the right person.&nbsp; Ron might be the one.&nbsp; After supper, I will steer the conversation towards what we heard from you guys last night, and then I will let you talk Ron and me into joining you downstairs."

Sara shook her head slowly and said, "Clink, clink, clink, clink, clink.."&nbsp; The Three J's looked at her and she said, "The roller coaster is starting up the first hill, and I think it is going to be a really steep and&nbsp; bumpy ride on the way down."

All four girls were laughing as Ron and Kevin came back in the room.&nbsp; They were wearing the light weight track suits that they had on the previous evening.&nbsp; "Are you ladies finished with your necessary&nbsp; girl talk' or do Kevin and I have to go back and shave or something?"

"Were we that obvious?" asked Joan.

"We don't mind," answered Kevin.&nbsp; "What is obvious is that you four are very close friends.&nbsp; And close friends - male or female - like to check signals regularly in strange situations.&nbsp; Two of you were out of the loop half the day.&nbsp; You needed to talk about today..., tonight..., and maybe tomorrow to make sure that you all agreed on what was what."

"Wow," said Judy.&nbsp; "The only thing worse that someone who doesn't understand you is someone who does."

"So what's the plan for the evening?" asked Kevin.

"Drinks, conversation, and supper," answered Sara, "and then drinks, conversation and whatever out on the deck.&nbsp; And then Judy wants to find out what made me scream so loud last night.&nbsp; Ron, if you're up for a really wild roller coaster ride, we'll let the carousel crowd have the deck and hot tub for the night and the four of us will go downstairs for some wild and kinky sex."

Kevin shook his head.&nbsp; Ron laughed.&nbsp; "Boy, she just says it, doesn't she?&nbsp; But that sounds like a good plan to me.&nbsp; What about you, Kevin?&nbsp; Do you think you could stand a quiet evening with just Julie and the hot tub?'

Kevin didn't respond at first, but then he looked over at Julie and her hopeful face and stammered, "Yes... of course..."

Joan could sense that there was still something bothering Kevin so she piped up, "Then it's settled.&nbsp; The hot tub is reserved for Kevin and Julie tonight from 8:00 o'clock on.&nbsp; We won't even use it ourselves before that.&nbsp; Just conversation and drinks on the deck until 8:00."

Kevin seemed to relax greatly and went over to stand next to Julie.&nbsp; He pulled her into himself in a sideways hug.&nbsp; Judy, who was now standing behind them, began mimicking riding a merry-go- round horse.&nbsp; She abruptly stopped moving up and down as Julie turned to say something to her.

Joan, Judy and Julie used the time before supper to shower and freshen up.&nbsp; When they came back, all three had changed into their light weight, pajama-style sweat suits.&nbsp; Meanwhile, Ron and Kevin sat in the living room and watched TV, and Sara remained in the kitchen preparing the evening meal.&nbsp; She continued to wear her Hello Kitty nightshirt.

Following supper, all six sat around on the deck fully clothed and talked.&nbsp; Sara even kept her nightshirt on when she twice went out to get a bottle of wine.&nbsp; As eight o'clock approached, Sara announced, "Last call on wine before the four of us bid you adieu and go downstairs."

She then refilled everyone's glasses and took the empty bottle out to the case buried in the snow.&nbsp; When she returned she announced in train conductor fashion, "All aboard.&nbsp; Roller coaster leaves from downstairs in five minutes."&nbsp; Then grinning broadly, she headed back inside and down the steps.

By the time Joan, Judy and Ron got downstairs, Sara was stripped down to just her collar and had laid out all of the Jurgensen's toys on the couch in the big room.

Ron glanced back up the steps to be sure that the door to the stairway was closed and said, "I assume you girls decided in advance to keep things down to Kevin's comfort level."

Joan replied, "Julie asked us to keep it to the carousel level on the deck tonight.&nbsp; Evidently Kevin is afraid of roller coasters and she doesn't want to scare him off."

"But you aren't afraid of roller coasters," said Judy, running her hand down the front of Ron's shirt.&nbsp; "So let's get this ride rolling."

She walked over to the array of toys on the couch and exclaimed, "Wow!&nbsp; No wonder you were yelling.&nbsp; There is enough here to be too much for anyone."

"Not for me," answered Joan.

"Wanna bet?" fired back Judy.

"What's the stakes?" asked Joan.

"Sara told me how you had her wired up and used the paddle on her.&nbsp; We both get wired up.&nbsp; Ron and Sara swing the paddles and turn up the controls.&nbsp;&nbsp; Ron swats me; Sara swats you.&nbsp; Ron controls your electro-stims and Sara controls mine.&nbsp; We go until one of us says&nbsp; Uncle.'"

"What's the winner get?" asked Joan.

"Satisfaction," answered Judy.

"And the loser?"

"Losers!" said Judy with a smile.&nbsp; "We are in this as teams.&nbsp; The losers get strung up and wired up overnight while the winning team goes into the bedroom and makes sweet love all night long.&nbsp; Of course, the winners also have the right to come out once in a while and warm the losers' asses a little with one of the paddles."

"Do you agree to that, Sara?" asked Joan.

"I'm in," answered Sara.

"What about you, Ron.&nbsp; If you loose you end up with contact pads on your nipples and electro- stim rings on your johnson.&nbsp; You willing to risk that?"

"I won't lose," said Judy.

"Then I guess I will risk it," answered Ron.

"So," said Judy.&nbsp; "The submission word is&nbsp; Uncle,' and we keep going until one of us breaks."

"Orgasms don't count as breaking, do they?" asked Sara.

"No," answered Judy, "Only if you cry&nbsp; Uncle.'"

"Click, click, click, click, click," said Sara softly.

"What?" asked Ron.

"The roller coaster is starting up the first hill," answered Joan.

"We should probably all be naked for this," said Judy as she started to take off her top.&nbsp; Once everyone was naked, she stood under one of the beams and asked, "So, how does this work?"

"Sara knows," replied Joan as she stood under the other beam facing Judy.

Sara gave four cuffs to Ron and said, "Small ones on the wrists, big ones on the ankle.&nbsp; The clip close to the wall for the feet chain is double sided.&nbsp; Move it up the chain to tighten things so that her legs are held well apart."

When both girls were properly restrained, Sara handed one of the control boxes to Ron and said, "This belts onto her waist in the back - no put it on the front since I'm the one who will be changing control settings.&nbsp; I will do the same for Joan's."

Holding up one of the vaginal cups she said, "I think you can figure out where this goes.&nbsp; Remember to lube the contact strips as well as the metal dildo.&nbsp; It ties on like a thong bikini."

"I've never tied one of those in place before," answered Ron.&nbsp; When Sara looked up at him he added, "But I have untied a few of them so I guess I know how it is supposed to work."

After the nipple and vaginal electrodes were in place, Ron asked, "Are you sure you two want to go through with this?"

"The roller coaster is already at the top of the first hill," answered Joan.&nbsp; "Let's do it."

"Start with the nipple controls," said Sara as she turned Judy's control up to 3.&nbsp; Judy drew in a sharp intake of breath as the sting began.

Ron turned Joan's controller and she too reacted.

"It cycles up and down, so we should wait a little between changes." Sara informed Ron.

"Five minute steps?" asked Ron.

"Works for me," answered Sara.&nbsp; Meanwhile both Joan and Judy were starting to vocalize slightly as their bodies tried to get used to the tingling sting, and they worked to turn the pain into pleasure.

"Going to five," said Sara.

"Five it is," responded Ron.

Joan and Judy both began swaying slightly from side to side as the pulses bit into their nipples.

Five minutes later, Sara giggled and said, "Time for some pussy popping."&nbsp;&nbsp; She turned the other control knob to 3.&nbsp; 

Ron did likewise, and both girls again took ragged intakes of breath as their body accustomed itself to the painful stinging sensation.

"It's too bad we don't have another couple of controllers," said Sara.&nbsp; "There are two anal torpedoes that we could have used."

"Some other time," grunted Joan.

"Pussy power to 5," announced Sara.&nbsp; Soon both Joan and Judy were grunting in time with the pulses.

"Nipples to 8?" suggested Ron.

"Why not?" answered Sara.

Now both Joan and Judy were starting to writhe as they worked desperately to turn the pain into pleasure.&nbsp; Neither was a natural at it like Sara was, but both soon began to thrust their pelvises in a fucking motion as their bodies finally started to respond - or perhaps in an attempt to make their bodies respond.

"Pussies to 8" said Sara.&nbsp;&nbsp; Now both girls were beginning to thrust and grind like Sara had done the night before.

"It's time for some paddle action," said Sara.&nbsp; She handed one of the thick leather paddles to Ron.&nbsp; "Make it loud," she instructed him.
"Thwack!!!"&nbsp; Both paddles hit ass cheeks simultaneously.&nbsp; After the third or fourth swat, both girls began thrusting their asses back and up to receive the paddle.&nbsp; It was hard to tell if this was because they were getting sexual pleasure out of the strikes, or were trying to show that they could take it and more.

Sara was pretty sure that Joan sort of liked it, but Judy seemed to be forcing herself.&nbsp; She was slightly surprised that Ron wasn't sporting an erection.&nbsp; Either he wasn't into swinging the paddle, or he recognized that Judy wasn't being turned on by it and felt too guilty about what he was doing to get turned on.

After twenty or so swats with the paddles, Sara said, "I think it's time for nipples to maximum."

Joan took a deep breath.&nbsp; Judy began to quiver slightly.&nbsp; Ron said, "Back to paddle time... on one, two, THREE."&nbsp;&nbsp; Again the thwack of the paddles resounded as they stuck squarely on Joan and Judy's asses.

Another twenty swats passed and Sara said, "Pussy power to maximum."

Joan was now swaying back and forth with each pulse.&nbsp; Judy was trembling and looked like she was about to break.&nbsp; Five swats later, however, it was Joan who suddenly yelled, "Uncle!&nbsp; Uncle!&nbsp; Uncle!"

Sara stepped forward and released the batteries from both controllers.

Judy's head hung slightly limp, but she quickly pulled herself together and said, "Ron, leave Joan where she is.&nbsp; Put Sara in my place."

Ron unclipped Judy's cuffs from the chains and removed them from her hands and legs.&nbsp; Sara put the cuffs on her ankles, but wasn't able to wrap them securely on her wrists by herself.&nbsp; Ron pulled them tight and secured the velcro to hold them in place.

Judy removed the controller from her waist and put it around Sara's waist with the controller in the back.&nbsp; Then she moved the controller that had been in front on Joan's waist around to her back.&nbsp;&nbsp; After wiping everything down with the antiseptic wipes which were with the toys, she re- lubed the vaginal plate and tied it in place on Sara.

Judy put the batteries back into the controllers and said, "I think we will set everything at level seven.&nbsp;&nbsp; That is just above pleasure, but not far enough into pain to be torture."&nbsp; After running her hand across Joan's bright red behind, she said, "Ron and I are going into the bedroom to see if my team can win the superbowl at least once tonight.&nbsp; We'll see you in the morning."&nbsp; Then she and Ron went into the bedroom and closed the door.

After the door was closed, Sara asked softly, "Why did you throw the contest?&nbsp; Judy was near breaking.&nbsp; I could see it in her muscles and in her face.&nbsp; You, on the other hand, could have gone on forever.&nbsp; We didn't have to lose."

"She has no inner fire," answered Joan.&nbsp; "For her it was all pain.&nbsp; She tried.&nbsp; She was trying to make it feel good, but she couldn't make it happen.&nbsp; I know I could have won, but I also knew that she couldn't afford to lose.&nbsp; There is no way she would be able to spend the night like this."

Sara smiled at Joan as she continued, "I know your fire will rapidly turn this into pleasure if it hasn't already.&nbsp; And I also know that watching you will keep my inner fire burning brightly enough that I can also turn the pain into pleasure.&nbsp; We lost, and our forfeit is that we have to endure a night of pleasure out here while Ron and Judy enjoy of night of pleasure in there.&nbsp; So, we didn't lose after all.&nbsp; We both won."

Sara rolled her head slowly as she savored the pulses that were tingling and biting at her nipples and her pussy lips.&nbsp; "It's a good thing I slept all day," she murmured as her body began to respond.&nbsp; "I have a feeling I am going to be tired again in the morning."

"You and me both," said Joan, as her body also began to respond and her hips began to thrust slowly back and forth in time with the pulses.

1Three J's and an S Go Skiing - Day 5, Part 1 By The Technician

BDSM&nbsp;&nbsp; FFF/F&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; D/s&nbsp; /&nbsp; Mild / No sex in this segment

 = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =
Four young college girls on a skiing vacation have to find other things to do when an excess of new snow traps them in their cabin.&nbsp; This is the sixth in this series and describes a day with life- changing events for Kevin and for Julie.&nbsp; 

There is basically NO SEX IN THIS SEGMENT.&nbsp; What was supposed to be a minor interlude setting up some character development got away from me and grew on its own to became a whole segment.&nbsp; I was going to hack it back down to size, but I like the story so I am putting it in its own segment that you can just skip if you want to. 

 If you just want the sex - which is what I am usually looking for in stories like this - skip to Three J's and an S Go Skiing - Day 5, Part 2.&nbsp; That has no character development, just electro- sex, bondage sex, anal sex and maybe even a replay of some lesbian action in the hot tub.

This story might make more sense if you have read the previous days of "Three J's and an S Go Skiing"

For the most part, the stories in this series are pretty mild.

If you are looking for heavy duty stuff, try one of my other story series.&nbsp;

Joan and Sara were both hanging almost limp in their chains when Judy came out of the bedroom in the morning.&nbsp; Their bodies were covered with sweat and they were both moaning softly and rocking their hips slightly.

"Oh my God," yelled Judy.&nbsp; "Ron, come out here."

She ran over and tried to unclip Joan's wrist cuffs.&nbsp; "Help me," she yelled to Ron as he came out of the bedroom.&nbsp; "We have to get them down."

Joan seemed to wake up slightly and smiled a very odd and wrinkled smile at Judy.&nbsp; "Have you ever been overwhelmed with pleasure?" she asked in an odd, sleepy sounding voice.&nbsp; "Have you ever been so far into pleasure that nothing else exists?... no time... no space... no pain... not even your body.&nbsp;&nbsp; All that exists is pleasure."

"It looks like sensory exhaustion," said Ron.

Judy looked at him with a very confused expression on her face, and he continued.&nbsp; "In laymen's terms, 'You fucked her brains out.'&nbsp; She is so overloaded on endomorphins and endorphins right now from the pain and the pleasure sensations that her brain has basically shut down."

"Do you mean she is high on pain and pleasure?"

"Actually..."&nbsp; Ron paused as if he was going to explain further, but instead said , "Yes... short answer, Yes.&nbsp; She's OK.&nbsp;&nbsp; She just needs to sleep it off."

"Is Sara OK?" asked Judy as she and Ron lowered Joan to the couch.

"I'm fine," came a voice from behind them.&nbsp; "I was just asleep.&nbsp; Continuous multiple orgasms, even if they were kind of small ones, can really wear you out.&nbsp; I think Joan blew a fuse about 2:00 am.&nbsp;&nbsp; The batteries in my unit ran out around 3:00 and I decided to go to sleep."

"She wore out the machine," slurred Joan.&nbsp; "I think that is the text book definition of sexually insatiable."

As Ron and Judy freed Sara from her cuffs, he asked, "Are you sure you're OK?"&nbsp; 

"I'm more than OK," answered Sara, "I'm fine - mighty fine."

Ron laughed and shook his head, "I am really going to regret ever having said that, aren't I?"

Sara just gave him one of her lopsided grins and rubbed her wrists where the cuffs had been.

"Let's get Joan into bed," she said and began to pull Joan to a standing position.&nbsp; Ron and Judy help take her into the bedroom.&nbsp; Just as they were setting her down on the bed, there was a loud roar from outside the window and a thudding noise of something being thrown against the cabin.

"What in the hell is that?" snapped Judy.

Ron quickly looked out the window and answered, "The state blower."

Sara and Judy looked out through the top of the window that wasn't buried in snow.&nbsp; A fairly large state highway department dump truck was passing slowly by.&nbsp; On the front of it was the biggest snow blower either girl had ever seen.&nbsp; It was the width of one lane of the highway, and instead of having just one whirling blade cutting through the snow, there were six blades stacked one on top the other so that the snowblower's mouth pushing into the snow was as tall or taller than the truck it was mounted to.&nbsp; Two pickup trucks with "Dave's Snow Removal" signs on the doors followed slowly behind it.

When the pickup trucks got to the driveway, the second truck stopped and two men got out and took something out of the bed of the pickup truck.&nbsp; It was a long, white, fiberglass pole with a little red flag on the top of it.&nbsp; The walked up onto the snow and then a little way into the driveway before pushing the rod into the snow as far as it would go.&nbsp; They pulled it back out and then took a few more steps and pushed it in again.&nbsp;&nbsp; They repeated this until the rods suddenly would only go about half as far into the snow.

"What are they doing?" asked Judy.

"Probing for cars," answered Ron.&nbsp; "Pretty soon a small tractor with a big snow thrower on the front of it will come up the road and clear the driveway back as far as the car.&nbsp; The probe flags tell it when to stop so it doesn't chew up your car.&nbsp; Later another crew will come by and dig out your car."

"That's nice of them," said Sara.

"And they are well paid for it," replied Ron with a chuckle.&nbsp; "It is all part of the yearly fees for these cabins.&nbsp; They end up doing this two or three times every winter.&nbsp; But this is probably the worst it has been in quite a few years."

He turned around and checked Joan's pulse and then lifted one of her eyelids to look into her eye.&nbsp; "Let's let her sleep for a while.&nbsp; She should be pretty good in an hour or so."

"I'm going upstairs to fix some breakfast," said Sara.&nbsp; "You two come up when you are ready."

Fifteen minutes later Ron and Judy came upstairs.&nbsp; Both were wearing the sweatsuits they had been wearing the night before.&nbsp; Kevin and Julie were already at the table.&nbsp; They, too, were wearing their sweatsuits from the previous evening.&nbsp; Sara, on the other hand, was wearing only her collar.
"No bacon this morning?" asked Judy.

"Found the aprons," answered Sara, pointing to an apron hanging on the knob of one of the cabinet doors.

"I made the decision for bacon and eggs," announced Sara.&nbsp; "There is also toast and coffee."

The five sat around the table eating and talking for almost an hour and a half when Kevin announced that he was going to go take a shower.&nbsp; He had been gone for only a few moments when the sound of a roaring engine and a loud klaxon horn could be heard in front of the cabin.

"Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit," yelled Ron as he dashed into the living room and drew aside the curtains.

The large highway snowblower was roaring past at high speed with the driver leaning out of his window to see around the machinery.&nbsp; "Kevin!" yelled Ron.&nbsp; "Gear up!&nbsp; All call! we're going out! "

"What's happening?" asked Julie.

"Only a couple of things would pull a state blower away from a job, and only ONE thing would cause him to lock down the horn and not put the blower in travel position.&nbsp; There's been an avalanche somewhere on the mountain."

He already had the satellite phone in his hands when it began to beep.&nbsp; He answered with "Where?&nbsp; How bad?"&nbsp; Then he listened for a minute or two and hung up.

Kevin came running into the room, drying his hair.&nbsp; "Some idiot," explained Ron to Kevin, "followed their GPS up the summer access road on the other side.&nbsp; He thought he could get up to the lodge through there because it didn't show as closed on the highway conditions website.&nbsp; Hell, it isn't even on the highway conditions website because it's got big chains across it from the end of September to the end of May.&nbsp; The chains must have been buried in the snow and the idiot just drove on through."

"He got through to the Sheriff on his cell phone and explained what happened.&nbsp; They sent a county plow up there to rescue him.&nbsp; Plow driver reported that he had reached the car and was going to bring them back in his truck when suddenly he yelled 'Avalanche!' and they lost radio communication."

"The driver must have activated his emergency locator beacon, because they have a solid ping on the emergency frequency.&nbsp; A little while later they got a real weak transmission they think is from the driver.&nbsp; Something about putting his bed up and hoping it would poke through the snow."

"How bad is it?" asked Sara.

Ron paused in putting on his boots and said a measured, calm voice.&nbsp; "If a highway dump truck driver is hoping that his fully raised bed is poking through the snow, they are buried deep."

"What about the people in the car?" asked Judy.

"If the people were inside the car..., and if the car wasn't swept too far away.., and if we can find them..., and if the car wasn't crushed..., and if the car windows weren't blown through by the snow..., and if we can get to them in time..., we might be able to save them."

Ron then turned to Kevin, "Air rescue is going to drop locator strobes on the beacon.&nbsp; Two county rescue crews and a highway snow emergency crew will meet us there.&nbsp; We are going up and over the black diamond slope to intersect with the road on the back side."

He then turned to Judy and said, "If everything goes OK, we should be back in a few hours."

"And if not?"

"Put flowers on my grave every spring."&nbsp; Said Kevin.

With that Ron and Kevin ran out across the deck and down into the back yard.&nbsp; The two snowmobiles with the emergency sleds behind them soon roared away from the cabin.&nbsp; They evidently had European-style sirens because their exit was accompanied by what sounded like two donkeys singing soprano.

"What did he mean by that?" asked Julie.

Joan answered from the top of the stairs behind them.&nbsp;&nbsp; "They are going over to the west side of the mountain and cutting across under the high bluffs.&nbsp; It's normally blocked off all winter because of the extreme risk of avalanche.&nbsp; Just because the snow slides once doesn't mean it won't slide twice.&nbsp; He was serious.&nbsp; If the snow lets loose again, and they are under it, they might not come back."

Judy and Julie hugged each other and both began crying.

Sara called out from the living room.&nbsp; "They have it on TV."

The four of them stood in front of the set watching what was apparently a live feed from a news helicopter.&nbsp;&nbsp; A news anchor was talking, but he was only describing what they could already see.&nbsp; Below and to one side of the news copter, a small, red helicopter was hovering over a small clearing.&nbsp; A man in an orange jumpsuit was leaning out of the side opening holding something which he dropped to the ground.&nbsp; He then held another, and another and dropped them.&nbsp;&nbsp; Three bright orange strobe lights began blinking in the clearing.&nbsp;&nbsp; The camera zoomed in for a close up of the lights.&nbsp; A long green strip of metal that looked something like a park bench could be seen on the snow.

"That's the top of the truck!" exclaimed Judy.&nbsp; "The snow has to be ten to fifteen feet deep."

As they watched, two red snowmobiles came into the picture.&nbsp; As soon as they came to a stop, two men in yellow jumped off of each of them carrying a shovel and ran to the center of the strobe lights.&nbsp; All four began digging frantically in the snow near the green metal.&nbsp; In a few moments one of the men jumped into the hole and bent low as if he were looking at something.&nbsp; A moment later the others pulled him back up out of the hole and two of them lay flat on the ground with their hands extended down into the hole.&nbsp; It was obvious they were pulling on something, or something was pulling on them.&nbsp; The other two also reached down into the hole and soon a new pair of hands could be seen, and then arms, and then the torso of a man wearing a bright yellow-green vest.

The rescued plow driver was pointing at the snow in front of the truck.&nbsp; Then he made a rolling motion with his arms and hands.&nbsp; The newscaster whispered dramatically, "I think he is trying to tell them that the car was swept off the road and was rolled further down the hill."

Another snowmobile came into the picture.&nbsp; This one was the same yellow-green as the driver's vest.&nbsp; There were two men on it in bright orange snow suits with vests identical to the driver's.

"I believe those are highway personnel," intoned the news anchor.&nbsp; 

"No shit, Sherlock," muttered Joan.

One of the men took something out of a silver case.&nbsp; It looked somewhat like a radar gun, but had a much larger screen on it.&nbsp; The other man spoke with the driver for several seconds and then both of them got onto the snowmobile and roared out of the picture.

"I think that is a heat sensor," said Judy.&nbsp; "They are hoping to spot the heat of the car engine."

The man suddenly pointed to a spot on the ground about twenty feet downhill from the truck.&nbsp; The four rescue workers again began digging frantically.&nbsp;&nbsp; As they were digging, the camera backed out slightly to show Ron and Kevin's bright orange snowmobiles arriving on the scene.

"Well, at least they made it that far," said Joan.

"You're real hopeful," replied Julie.

"Just being honest," answered Joan.

The newscaster reported, "It would appear that snow emergency ambulances have arrived on scene.&nbsp; If Newscopter 11 can pan back down the road a little ways, we should be able to see how far the hospital ambulances have gotten."

The helicopter pilot followed the anchors direction and turned so that the cameraman could zoom in on the state blower truck several miles away moving slowly up the road.&nbsp; Three regular ambulances were following in its path.

"Stay there a moment," ordered the anchor, and the cameraman zoomed in on the highway snowmobile as it arrived at the ambulances.&nbsp;&nbsp; The ambulances stopped as the snowmobile carrying the rescued driver pulled alongside.&nbsp; The EMTs in the third ambulance helped him down the snow wall and had him sit in the open back doors of the ambulance.

Meanwhile the snowblower moved quite a ways forward, and then backed up and cut a wider swath of snow.&nbsp; It did this several times until there was a fairly wide area cleared of snow.&nbsp; Then it continued on.

Two of the ambulances followed.&nbsp; The third turned around in the cleared area and sped back down the highway.

The news camera returned to the scene of the avalanche.&nbsp; There were now seven men digging frantically in the snow.&nbsp; It was a fairly large hole that got narrower as it moved downward in the snow.&nbsp; As the hole got smaller, one of the men got up out of the hole, then another, and then another until there were only two digging at the bottom.

Suddenly one of red snowmobile suits ran over to the e-cass and opened the back doors.&nbsp; He came running back with a small black satchel and jumped down into the hole and disappeared.

"They must have found the car," announced the news anchor.

"Either than, or Ron just followed Alice and the White Rabbit down into Wonderland," said Sara rather disgustedly.&nbsp; She followed that with, "Idiot!"

A moment later the other red suit ran over to the hole.&nbsp; A small object was handed up to him.

"It's a small child," cried Julie.

The news camera zoomed in close on the face of a four or five year old.

"His eyes are open!" yelped Judy.&nbsp; "He's alive!"

The red suit - apparently Kevin - carried the child over to the e-cap and lifted the lid.&nbsp; He laid him carefully inside and lowered the plexiglass lid back over him.&nbsp; He then ran back to the hole and jumped in.

He returned a few moments later carrying a slightly larger child whom he also placed carefully in the e-cap.&nbsp; He then ran over to the e-cass and carried both stretchers over to the hole.

Two of the other men reached down into the hole and helped pull an adult up out of the car.&nbsp; It appeared to be a woman.&nbsp; She was barely able to stand.&nbsp; They placed her on the stretcher and Kevin and one of the other men carried her over and slid her into the e-cass.
A moment later they were pulling another adult from the hole.&nbsp; This person was slightly larger and appeared to be totally limp as they lifted him out and lay him on the stretcher.&nbsp; As soon as he was on the stretcher, Ron appeared in the hole and set his bag up on the snow.&nbsp; One of the men helped him up out of the hole while the others put the stretcher in the emergency ambulance.

Ron began to walk over toward the e-cass when suddenly everyone began running.&nbsp; The news anchor, always quick to state the obvious, said, "Something is happening." 

The camera pulled back and showed all seven men running toward the snowmobiles.&nbsp; The e-cep was first in line with Kevin driving.&nbsp; Then the two red snowmobiles, and finally Ron with the e- cass.&nbsp; The highway department man jumped on behind Ron as all four snowmobiles sped away from the scene at high speed.

The camera pulled further back and the news anchor announced, "There appears to be a major avalanche sliding toward them.&nbsp; They are trying to outrun it, but it doesn't look good.&nbsp; It doesn't look like they are going to make it.

Judy and Julie were both crying, "No, no, no, no," as they watched the snow flow down toward the road on which the snowmobiles were racing.

Just as the leading edge of the slide reached the road Kevin did something totally unexpected.&nbsp; He turned at an almost right angle directly into the avalanche and began going uphill against the flow of snow.&nbsp;&nbsp; The three snowmobiles following him had no choice but to make the same turn or hit him.&nbsp; The e-cass rocked wildly as Ron turned it hard uphill into the avalanche.&nbsp; They were obviously speeding uphill, but were not going anywhere because the snow was flowing beneath them almost as fast as they were moving uphill.

The news announcer was repeating "Oh, my God!&nbsp; Oh, my God!" almost as if he were chanting a mantra.&nbsp; Then he changed to "This is terrible.&nbsp; This is terrible."&nbsp; Finally, as the slide stopped moving, the snowmobiles started gaining ground and actually began moving uphill.

Kevin turned his sled slowly back toward the trail and heading out over the freshly shifted snow toward the waiting ambulances.&nbsp; The other snowmobiles followed.

"Unbelievable!&nbsp; Unbelievable! Unbelievable!&nbsp; Unbelievable!" chanted the news anchor.&nbsp; "That was a one in a million chance and it worked!"&nbsp; 

Judy and Julie just stood in front of the television and cried.

A few minutes later the news caster said that they had a live reporter with the ambulances and the helicopter camera zoomed in to show several snowmobiles alongside the ambulances which were now turned around in a large area cleared by the state blower.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Someone was standing next to one of the snowmobiles surrounded by a camera crew.

A couple of state highway trucks were in the area between the ambulances and the snow blower and men with shovels were working frantically to break down the snow wall to create a ramp from the road up to the top of the snow.&nbsp; The image switched to the ground level cameras and a female in a blue parka began to speak.&nbsp; "We are waiting the arrival of the rescue ambulance.&nbsp; We have been told that the family is alive, but injured.&nbsp; That's all we know right now."

The image cut back to the helicopter and you could see Ron and Kevin's snowmobiles approaching the now silent snow blower.&nbsp; Several men on top of the snow were directing them toward the ramp down to the highway.&nbsp; The ground level camera took over to show the orange snowmobiles and their sleds descend to highway level and stop.

The ground ambulance personnel ran to the e-cep and bundled the two children into one of the ambulances.&nbsp; A moment later the woman was transferred to a Gurney and placed in the same ambulance which immediately roared off down the highway.&nbsp; The EMTs took more time with the man.&nbsp; Inserting IVs and stabilizing his neck, leg and one arm before transferring him to the remaining ambulance.

The orange snowmobiles turned in the clearing on the highway and roared back up the ramp to the top of the snow where they stopped for a few minutes as Ron and Kevin spoke with the other rescue personnel before pulling away at a much more reasonable speed and heading on down alongside the highway.&nbsp; The camera followed them for some time while the announcer speculated on who the drivers might me.&nbsp; He stated, "I think they are part of the Snow Rescue team from Mountain Lodge Resort.&nbsp; We will try to find out who they are and get an interview later today.

Julie's cell phone rang and she squealed as she read the ID.&nbsp; "It's Kevin," she cried out. The others watched her as she listened and then replied, "We know.&nbsp; We were watching on television.&nbsp; OK.&nbsp; We will see you in a little while."

She turned to the others and said, "They are coming back on the trail alongside the highway.&nbsp; They have to stop up at the aid station to refuel and replenish their kit and then they are coming back down here."

"I'm going to clean up," said Judy.

"So am I," added Julie.

"You might as well clean up a little too," Sara said to Joan.&nbsp; "You look like hell."

"Thanks a lot." replied Joan.&nbsp; "I heard what Ron was saying downstairs, even if I wasn't responding too well.&nbsp; I always thought having your brains fucked out was just a myth, but after my twentieth or so orgasm, it was like I passed out with my eyes open."

"I think that happens to me at around my hundredth," answered Sara with her characteristic grin.&nbsp; "But I'm not sure because I've never gotten past ninety in the same night."

Joan wasn't sure whether Sara was kidding or not, so she just replied, "I'm going to grab a shower as soon a Julie is out."

It was nearly an hour later when Ron and Kevin came back into the yard.&nbsp; When they entered the door from the deck, each was carrying something - a twenty four bottle case of Lone Star beer in long neck bottles.

"I think we need to kick back and relax tonight, and wine just doesn't do it for me," explained Kevin.

"That's a lot of kicking back," observed Joan.

"We thought we might relax in the hot tub together and we weren't sure if you ladies might not want a change of pace from the wine." answered Kevin.

"You OK with everyone in the hot tub?" asked Sara.

"After today, I don't think I'm afraid of anything&nbsp; anymore - even roller coasters.&nbsp; In fact, I don't think much will scare me from now on.&nbsp; What is a bunch of naked people in a hot tub compared to a couple million pounds of snow.&nbsp; Count me in for a long soak on the deck tonight."

He looked over at Julie and added, "If it's OK with you."

She nodded her head eagerly, but said nothing.

Judy started to say something, but was cut off by the beep and warble of Ron's satellite phone.

Ron's voice got a little louder and harsher as he said, "Do we have to, sir?&nbsp; It was just a standard snow rescue with a minor problem with sliding snow."

He clicked off his phone and said to Kevin.&nbsp; "We have to go back up to the aid station.&nbsp; They've given the TV station permission to land on the heli-pad so they can interview 'today's heros.'"

"What am I supposed to tell them?... that we lucked out beyond belief?"

"I am going to say that we were just following our training," said Ron with a smile.&nbsp; "That's my story and I'm sticking to it...."&nbsp; His face and voice became expressionless as he finished, "...regardless of what the truth actually is."

"What do you mean?" asked Joan.

"We were dead, and we knew it," answered Kevin.&nbsp; "When the slide caught us, I knew it would roll us down the slope and bury us all.&nbsp; As the leading edge hit, I turned slightly in an attempt to keep the machine from rolling for another few seconds.&nbsp; The tow sled broke loose and dragged me around.&nbsp; Suddenly I was facing uphill and running on top of the snow.&nbsp; I just opened the throttle and prayed I could stay on top."

Pointing over at Ron, he continued, " They turned to keep from T-boning me and ended up along side me.&nbsp; Nobody was more surprised than me when the snow stopped moving and we were still on the blue side of the white."

He looked around at the girls.&nbsp; "Everyone thinks we are heros, but the reality is we are just some of the most very damned lucky guys ever on the face of the earth."

"But you saved the family," said Judy.

"And you rode an avalanche!" added Julie.&nbsp; "That had to be totally terrifying.&nbsp; Those two kids must have been scared out of their minds."

"The two kids loved it!" exclaimed Kevin with a laugh.&nbsp; "When we got them out of that car, I didn't want them to be afraid of the glass coffin, so I told them that they were going to get to ride in a space capsule.&nbsp; When we finally got to the ambulance, they told me that it had been one of the neatest rides they had ever been on."

Kevin looked Julie directly in the eyes, "And it was.&nbsp; When that sled snapped around and suddenly we were riding an avalanche, I wasn't afraid.&nbsp; I was on top of the world.&nbsp; I was Pecos Bill riding a tornado.&nbsp; All I could think of was keeping the speed exact so we stayed in the same place and I didn't shoot off into the trees or something.&nbsp; I knew that if a tree or a branch or, hell, even a really hard chunk of snow got swept under the front skis, we would tumble and get buried, but for that moment, I was in control of life and death.&nbsp; I think my being in control in such a situation was what gave me the biggest rush.&nbsp; Maybe that's why I've never been to crazy about roller coasters... I'm not in control on a roller coaster."

He turned slightly red and looked a little away from Julie's face.&nbsp; "I was so turned on.&nbsp; I was harder than granite.&nbsp; If you had been there at the ambulance after I transferred the kids to the paramedics, I think I could have taken you right there in the snow in front of Chanel 11 News and everybody."

Ron coughed slightly.&nbsp; "Speaking of Chanel 11 News, we have an interview to get to."

Addressing the four girls he continued, "And since we have to be up at the aid station again anyway, we had best get everything written down in our reports.&nbsp; I have a feeling that this is going to be a little more well known than our usual rescues, so we'd better make sure all the i's are dotted and all the t's properly crossed.&nbsp; We'll grab something to eat out of the refrigerator at the aid station, so don't wait supper for us.&nbsp; Depending on how long this interview takes, we should be back here sometime before eight."

He then leaned forward and kissed Judy and said, "See you then."

Soon the whine of the snowmobile engines was fading into the distance.

As the sound of Ron and Kevin's snowmobiles faded, Sara said, "Well, it looks like it's the four of us for supper.&nbsp; Everything is ready so why don't we go ahead and eat."

When supper was finished and the girls were sitting sipping wine around the table, Julie said, "Uh...&nbsp; I.... uh... have a favor to ask."

"This sounds serious," commented Joan.&nbsp; "What do you want?"
"I want to give Kevin something special."

"A 'hero fuck' for Super Rescue Man?" asked Sara.

Julie turned more than slightly red and answered softly, "Something like that."

"When Kevin was talking about being in control and how being in control turned him on, I was imagining letting Kevin be totally in control of me."&nbsp; She turned a deep shade of red.&nbsp; "And God, that turned me on!&nbsp; I thought I was going to start dripping on the floor through my clothing."

"Welcome to the sisterhood," said Sara.

"I've never felt that way for anyone else - ever.&nbsp;&nbsp; But I do about Kevin!&nbsp; I want to give myself totally to him.&nbsp; I want him to know that he is totally in control and can take me in any way he desires."

"And you need us because?" asked Judy.

"I don't know what to do... or how to do it."

"I think the carousel crowd is going to go roller coastering in the basement tonight," said Joan.&nbsp; "We've got almost two hours before they get back.&nbsp; Let's all warm up for a while in the hot tub and then we will take our bondage virgin downstairs and prepare her to be sacrificed to the conquering hero."

Julie could not meet any of their eyes, but her breath was starting to come in shallow gasps and it looked like she was almost on the verge of orgasm.

"To the virgin offering," said Sara, raising her glass in a toast.

"To the virgin offering," replied The Three J's.

 = = = = = = = 

The Three J's and an S sat in the hot tub drinking wine and talking.&nbsp; Julie was trying to build up her courage for what she wanted to do, and the other girls were trying to release the tension of the events of the day.

"I think we need to shut you off on the wine now," Joan said after Julie had finished her glass.&nbsp; "You don't want to get sick."

"Yeah," added Sara snickering, "throwing up really puts a downer on the mood."

"Not to mention the fact," said Judy, "that you are going to be bound and gagged when Kevin arrives back tonight.&nbsp; Throwing up into a ball gag is a real downer."

"OK, OK," answered Julie.&nbsp; "I'm just trying to get totally in the mood."

"If you want to get TOTALLY in the mood to give yourself completely to Kevin, I think you should be the one to take the empty bottles back out to the box in the snow."

Joan added, "And do it like Sara would.... one bottle at a time."

"How many bottles are there?" asked Julie?

"Five," answered Sara.&nbsp; "I never got around the taking the bottles out from last night."

"OK," said Julie.&nbsp; "Five trips out through the snow barefoot and bare assed, just like Sara loves so to do so much."

"Wait a minute," said Sara.&nbsp; "You need to get your fire burning first in order to enjoy the cold."

She slid over to Julie and pulled her body against her own.&nbsp; "Just pretend that this is Kevin for a moment," she said as she pressed her mouth against Julie's and slid her hand between Julies legs.

In just a few moments Julie was squirming and panting.&nbsp; "Whoa, Sara," said Judy.&nbsp; "Don't take her over the top.&nbsp; She needs that fire burning hot enough to melt her way through the snow."

Sara slid back away from Julie and took a deep breath.&nbsp; "You are insatiable," said Joan.

"But good to have around when you need your fire lit," answered Sara.

"Get going," Joan said to Julie.&nbsp; 

As Julie started to climb the steps out of the hot tub, Judy swatted her hard on the ass.&nbsp; Julie gasped.&nbsp; "Was that pain or pleasure?" asked Judy.

"Not sure," answered Julie.

"You're getting there," said Sara.

Julie picked up the empty bottle of wine that was on the table and walked out through the snow to the two boxes buried by the picnic table.&nbsp; She put the bottle in the open case and returned to the deck.

"Pain or pleasure?" asked Judy again.

"Both," answered Julie.
"Closer," said Sara.

She went into the cabin and returned with another empty bottle.&nbsp; As she walked out to the picnic table, she moved off the path that she and Sara had worn in the snow so that she was walking almost waist deep through the compacted powder.

On each of the next three trips, she again pushed a new path through the snow.&nbsp; As she came up onto the deck after returning the fifth empty to the boxes in the snow, Judy again asked, "Pain or pleasure."

"The pain's still there," she answered, "but the pleasure is overwhelming it... and me."

"She's ready," announced Sara.&nbsp; 

"Let's go get the virgin ready for sacrifice," said Joan

They stopped in the kitchen so that Julie could write a note to Kevin.&nbsp; Joan wrote "KEVIN" in large, block letters on the top of a piece of paper with a black marker and then handed the paper to Julie.&nbsp; Julie wrote, "Kevin, when you were talking about how turned on you got by being in control, I was thinking about me letting you be in total control of me and I got REALLY turned on.&nbsp; I am downstairs.&nbsp; The girls are going to tie me up and get me ready in some fashion - they won't tell me what they are going to do.&nbsp; I am giving myself totally to you tonight.&nbsp; I am yours completely.&nbsp; You may use me in ANY way you desire.&nbsp; Don't think at all about my pleasure.&nbsp; My pleasure will come from giving you pleasure.&nbsp; I don't want our relationship to always be like this, but for tonight I am totally and completely in YOUR CONTROL."

"Wow," exclaimed Judy.&nbsp; "If this doesn't get him going that boy is dead."

"OK, let's put that on the door to the basement and go down and get you ready."

The four naked girls walked down into the basement.&nbsp; The chains were still hanging from the two beams from the night before.

"We don't need all of these," announced Sara as she began to remove the second set of restraints.

"Stand here," ordered Joan, indicating beneath the beam, "and put your hands above your head."

Julie stood where Joan had instructed her and raised her hands above her head.&nbsp; Judy wrapped one of the cuffs on her right wrist while Sara wrapped the left.&nbsp; Then they both clipped the cuff to the hanging chain.

"Time for the feet," said Joan as she began wrapping one of the ankle cuffs on Julie's leg.&nbsp; "Spread 'em as wide as you can go," she instructed and then clipped the cuff to the chain.&nbsp; After she had done the same with the other cuff, she announced, "Not tight enough," and went over to the wall to move the clip up the chain several inches.
Julie was now tightly bound with her legs spread almost uncomfortably wide.&nbsp; Sara walked up behind her and whispered in her ear.&nbsp; "You realize that you are now totally vulnerable, don't you?"

Julie took a deep breath.
"Kevin will be able to stroke your breasts as much as he wants."&nbsp; She ran her hands over Julie's breasts and slightly tweaked one nipple.&nbsp; "And he can run his hands over your body...&nbsp;&nbsp; ANYwhere...&nbsp; over ANY part of your body."

Sara ran her hands across Julie's buttocks and down the backs of her legs.&nbsp; She then started up the insides of Julie's legs rubbing lightly with the backs of her hands as she moved upward toward where her legs joined together.&nbsp; When she got to the top, she turned her hands over and rubbed her fingers against Julie's slit, sliding two fingers between her dripping pussy lips.&nbsp;&nbsp; Julie inhaled sharply as Sara's hand found her throbbing love button.&nbsp; "Just think what that will be like when it is Kevin doing it," whispered Sara as she removed her hands from Julie's body and stepped back leaving Julie whimpering softly.

"These are the controllers," Joan informed her as she fastened the two belts around Julie's waist.&nbsp; She placed the two controllers on the outside of Julie's back, one on each side just above her ass cheeks.&nbsp; "I put fresh batteries in them so they should be good for six or seven hours of continuous use."

"This is a ball gag," said Judy.&nbsp; "Notice the safety air hole so you won't choke if your nose gets clogged."

"And this is a blindfold," added Sara as she slipped it over Julie's eyes.&nbsp; "There are also some earplugs, but that might be too much for your first experience at bondage submission."

Julie felt someone moving the controllers slightly and then felt wires against her back.

"These are the nipple clamp contacts."&nbsp; It was Judy's voice.&nbsp; Julie felt the pressure as the clamps closed on her nipples.

"We will set them at three," said Joan, and Julie immediately felt a tingling sensation.

"This is a pussy popper," said Sara.&nbsp; "Actually, I think they call it a vaginal shield electro-stim contact plate, but pussy popper is more fun - and probably more accurate.&nbsp; We are going to set that for three also.... for now."

Julie felt the cold of the lube as the metal tube was inserted in her vagina, and then the greasy cold feel of the contact plate as it was pulled tight against the outer lips of her sex.&nbsp; Almost immediately after it was in place, she grunted slightly as the first tingling shocks hit her.

"And this is an anal torpedo."&nbsp; The voice sounded like Judy's, but with the distraction of the nipple and vaginal shocks, Julie couldn't be sure.&nbsp; She was still trying to figure out what an anal torpedo was when Joan began inserting the dildo shaped butt plug up her ass.

She wiggled her butt trying to escape the intruder, but Joan slapped her sharply on the ass cheek and said, "Anything means anything, and you said ANYTHING."

Julie tried to say "I said KEVIN could do anything," but all that came out were grunts as Joan slowly wiggled the electric dildo into her rectum.

"For this to truly be effective," said Sara, "it has to be set fairly high."&nbsp; Joan turned the control to eight.

Julie grunted and gyrated as her anal sphincter began to contract tightly in time with the electric pulses.&nbsp; Although she had never experienced the real thing, it soon felt like someone was fucking her in the ass.

"One more thing," said Judy.&nbsp; "We are going to glisten you up.&nbsp; This is baby oil gel that I am smearing all over your body."&nbsp; Julie began moaning as Judy rubbed the thick gel all over her body.

"And this is regular baby oil," added Sara as she poured copious amounts of the oil over Julie's shoulders and began to mix it with the thicker gel that already covered her body.

Julie was now bucking and grinding in time with the electric pulses.&nbsp; "We are going to let you stew a while," said Joan.&nbsp; "Kevin should be here in about a half hour.&nbsp; If he gets delayed, we may have to do something else, but for now, this should work fine.&nbsp; We're going back upstairs to the hot tub."

Julie was vaguely conscious of the sound of the girls going back upstairs.&nbsp; She definitely heard the door close solidly at the top of the stairs.

"What would you like to do until the guys get back?" asked Joan.

Judy replied, "We might as well get back into the hot tub until they arrive.&nbsp; I think Ron and I will go back into the bedroom at that point."&nbsp;&nbsp; She looked at Joan and Sara and smiled broadly.&nbsp; "He deserves a 'hero fuck' too, even if I'm not throwing myself at him cunt first."

Sara giggled and said, "She is kind of doing that, isn't she.&nbsp; Does that upset you?"

"Only because I didn't think of it first," answered Judy.&nbsp; "Only because I didn't think of it first."

As Joan started to step back down into the hot tub, she asked, "Sara, would you like to go get us some more wine?"

Sara paused and for a moment Joan thought she was going to say, "No," but instead she said, "Why don't we try the beer.&nbsp; That way we can honestly say that we didn't sit around and drink several bottles of wine every night for the whole time we were up here."

"You just want to bring the beer up here one bottle at a time," laughed Judy, "but a beer does sound good."&nbsp; She paused and added, "And then after Ron gets back I won't be mixing my liquors and end up sicker than a dog."

"So you're going to be doing doggie-style hero fucks tonight?" asked Sara in mock seriousness before dissolving into fits of laughter.

"Have YOU ever done doggie style?"&nbsp; Judy asked Sara in response.

"Kind of hard to do with two women unless one of you is strapped, and I've never done a man."&nbsp; She paused and looked very thoughtful for a moment and then continued, "Never done a dog either, but I think it would be about the same to me since I'm not really attracted to men or dogs.&nbsp; If I were horny enough, though, I would probably do either or both."&nbsp; She paused again and then added, "Never done a machine either, though I've gotten pretty wet watching some of the ads on the porn sites."

"Are you answering Judy's question or making a bucket list?" asked Joan.

"I think that would be a fuck-it list," answered Sara as she returned with the first of the beers.

Like Julie had done before her, she was now making a totally new path through the snow on each trip out to the cache of beer and wine on the picnic table.&nbsp; When she returned with the second bottle, Judy said, "I thought Lone Star bottles didn't unscrew... that you had to have a bottle opener."

"You can get them that way," answered Sara, "but most people want to be able to open them without an opener, so except for certain special runs, they are twist offs."&nbsp; She held the bottle down to her pussy lips and mimicked twisting it open.

"I saw this leather thong on line once that had a ridged depression right here," pointing to her cunt with the top of the bottle, "You could set the top of the bottle in it under your skirt and twist the cap off.&nbsp; The idea was to make it look like you were opening it with you pussy lips.&nbsp; I almost bought them, but couldn't figure out where I would ever wear them and who I would be drinking beer with that I could do that trick for."

"I've seen beer bottles there before, but they were already open, and there were no thongs or panties in the way."&nbsp; said Joan.

"It would give the beer a distinctive flavor, I imagine," said Judy.

"I'll have to try it some day," responded Sara as she twisted the cap off with her hand and gave th bottle to Joan in the hot tub.
A minute or so later, she was back with the final bottle of beer.&nbsp; She stood at the top of the steps into the tub, twisted the cap off and threw the it over onto one of the deck chairs.&nbsp; Then she lowered the bottle down to between her legs and inserted it into herself several times.

"Love the sensation of cold inside me," she said, and then after taking a deep swig from the bottle added, "and it does, indeed, add a distinctive flavor to the outside of the bottle that you pick up on your tongue as you drink."

She looked over at Judy and said, "I'll have to ask Ron his opinion on it in the morning."
Judy merely tipped her bottle at Sara in a salute and said, "You never know.&nbsp; You never know."

"Speaking of Ron," said Joan, "I think I hear the snowmobiles now."

Seconds later the two bright orange snowmobiles and their towed ambulance sleds came into the yard.&nbsp; Ron and Kevin walked over to the deck carrying their helmets and began to climb the steps.

"Ron, could I speak to you a moment over here," said Judy.

Joan said, "Kevin, Julie is waiting for you downstairs."

"I finally get brave enough to travel outside of my comfort zone and go full monty in the hot tub and she's not feeling adventurous tonight," he responded.&nbsp; He sighed deeply and added, "I'll never understand women."

"That's probably true," Joan replied, "but tonight isn't what you think.&nbsp; Julie is definitely feeling adventurous tonight - just not in the way that you expected."

Judy held her finger up to her lips to tell Ron to remain quiet and said to Kevin, "Julie is feeling very adventurous tonight and might be willing to travel well outside her comfort zone."

Sara added, "She might even be willing to travel all the way around the world, and you're not going to find her that adventurous very often."

"There's a note that explains everything on the door going downstairs," said Joan.&nbsp; "Just hang up your things, read the note, and go down on her.. I mean to her."

Kevin looked very confused, but mumbled, "OK... I guess..."&nbsp; He turned to say something, but instead muttered, " .... women," and walked into the cabin.

"What is going on?" asked Ron.

"Julie noticed that Kevin gets turned on by control," explained Judy, "so she decided that she would let him totally control her tonight.&nbsp; We helped her get ready and..." 
Judy couldn't continue for her snickers and giggles, so Sara completed the explanation.&nbsp; "Julie is downstairs chained to the beams, naked, blindfolded, and gagged with both electro-stim controllers pleasure pulsing the nipple clamps, the pussy cup, and the anal torpedo.&nbsp; Right now, she is probably hornier than a three peckered billy goat and would a deep throat a cactus and screw a doorknob both at the same time.&nbsp; If Kevin thought he had a wild ride this afternoon, just wait until he gets downstairs."

"I was thinking more along the lines of a few beers and then an evening of quiet thought and reflection," said Ron.&nbsp; After a long pause and long drink from the long neck, he stroked Judy's breast and added "... of course screwing my brains out has always helped me to clear my mind and focus my thoughts."
"I think that was a hint for us to go inside and start reflecting," said Judy.

Sara began to get up out of the hot tub and said, "I'll get you a couple of long necks to go.&nbsp; Thinking always makes me thirsty."

She returned shortly with four bottles, surprisingly bringing them in one trip.&nbsp; As she handed them to Ron she said, "We were discussing earlier about why some people like to put a lime in their beer bottles.&nbsp; Joan thought that it was to give Dos Equis or Corona a tangy over taste.&nbsp; Judy thought there was a better way to give a tangy over taste to Lone Star."&nbsp; She smiled over at Judy.&nbsp; "Maybe she could explain that to you sometime tonight."

Judy smiled back and mouthed, "I will get you for that!"

Sara just stuck her tongue out at Judy and handed the four long necks to Ron.&nbsp; "Have a good discussion and reflection," she called out merrily as Ron and Judy disappeared inside.

Meanwhile, Kevin was slowly walking downstairs as he read and re-read the note he had taken off the door without really understanding for sure what it meant.&nbsp; When he got to the bottom of the steps he stopped, frozen, watching Julie writhe and buck in her chains.&nbsp; Her body was glistening with gel, oil, and sweat.&nbsp; Her head was thrashing from side to side and she was moaning continuously through the red ball gag that filled her mouth.

He stepped up behind her and examined the controllers that were strapped to her waist.&nbsp; Tracing the wires from her nipples clamps he shut off that half of the controller and reaching around her removed both clamps at the same time.

Julie stood up as straight as she could and thrust her breasts forward trying to recapture the tingle.&nbsp; Instead, she felt Kevin's hands close around her breasts and felt his fingers circle her aureola and tug slightly on her nipples.&nbsp; "Give me a minute to get out of my clothes," she heard Kevin say and the hands left her breasts.

She began whimpering and thrusting her breasts forward.&nbsp; In a few moments she felt Kevin's body press against her from behind as his arms wrapped around her and fondled her breasts.&nbsp; He continued to tug gently at her nipples while at the same time rubbing his chest against her back.

She was now moaning shrilly through the gag.&nbsp; She felt his hands on her waist and suddenly the pulsing between her legs stopped.&nbsp; Kevin released the belt on one of the controllers and lowered it to the ground.&nbsp; He then untied the strings which held the vaginal cup in place and tried to slide it off her body.

He was surprised to discover that attached to the plate was a long electrode which was deep inside her, but as soon as he saw it, he changed from sliding the cup off her body to pulling it straight away from the opening of her pussy lips.

Then, still standing behind her, he began to rub up against her and to stroke her entire front.&nbsp; His hand traveled from tweaking her nipples to sliding between her legs and grazing her clit to pressing against her abdomen as he moved back toward her breasts.&nbsp; She was trying to tell him, "No, I want you to have all the pleasure," but nothing understandable could come out past the ball gag.

Besides, she could tell that he was also enjoying what was happening because his rigid prick was rubbing between her legs.&nbsp; The thought crossed her mind that she hoped he couldn't get shocked by the anal plug, but it didn't matter since he had now already moved around and was standing in front of her.

He pressed himself fully against her front.&nbsp; Her breasts were crushed against his abdomen.&nbsp; His erection was pressed between their bodies just above her pubic bone.&nbsp; His hands were kneading the globes of her ass, and he was starting give out short, guttural moans as he rocked against her.

Stepping slightly away from her, he ran his hands down the length of the outside of her legs and then back up to her breasts.&nbsp; After doing this several times, he bent his knees slightly and pushed himself between her legs.

Reaching under her arms and putting his hands up and over her shoulders from the back, he pulled suddenly and thrust himself upward into her quivering cunt.&nbsp; She exploded in an immediate orgasm, and continued to go higher as he thrust hard and fast for several minutes.&nbsp; Just when she thought that she could stand no more, he suddenly thrust very hard upward and held himself tight within her.

Julie felt like she was being impaled by his prick and being lifted off her feet.&nbsp; She wasn't wrong.&nbsp; With him pushed tightly inside her, she was on tip toe with barely anything touching the floor.&nbsp; He held himself, and her, like that for at least a full minute and then dropped down and lowered her to back onto her feet.

Julie thought he might stop and let her down so that they could go into the bedroom at this point, but instead, his hands began to again slide over her body.&nbsp; The combination of the heavy baby oil gel and baby oil and their own sweat had made her body extremely slippery.

Kevin rubbed his hands across every inch of her body.&nbsp; The sensations ran from sensual to soothing to painful and back to sensual.&nbsp; She began to come down from her orgasm, but remained in an extremely elevated sexual state.&nbsp; And as Kevin continued to stroke her, she felt herself climbing once again toward climax.&nbsp; This time, however, it wasn't a rapid rush as before, but a slow, steady, continuous increase in the fire within her.

Kevin again moved around behind her as he continued to stimulate the entire surface of her body.&nbsp; She felt movement of the second controller belt and heard it, too, being placed on the ground.&nbsp; Then the sensations in her anal canal lessened.&nbsp; Kevin was slowly turning down the level of the pulses.

Somehow, the lessening of the pulses made Julie more, not less, aware of them.&nbsp; It was no longer a sudden tightening of her anal sphincter, but it became rather a series of prickly shocks deep within her.&nbsp; As the level continued to slowly drop, it subsided to tickling tingles vaguely between her legs.&nbsp; Finally it was just a strange tickling sensation that seemed to be both inside and on the surface of her rear.

When the pulses were totally gone, she felt Kevin's fingers gripping the T-shaped base of the anal torpedo.&nbsp; He tugged steadily and twisted it slightly back and forth as he pulled it out of her.&nbsp; She felt his finger slide into her as soon as the torpedo had come out, and was surprised that it did not feel as if there was much resistance to that intrusion.&nbsp; She must have remained slightly open after the dildo was removed.

Kevin stood behind her and again began rubbing his body against her.&nbsp; He was once again rigid and erect - as only a virile,&nbsp; young man could be in so short a time.&nbsp; With one hand he reached up and began to loosen the straps which held the ball gag in place.&nbsp; "I want you to be able to say no to this," he explained. "And if you say no, I will stop, regardless of how far along we are."

He dropped the gag onto the floor and rubbed against her back with his body while kneading and massaging her breasts with his hands.&nbsp; He began rubbing his dick up and down in the crack of her ass cheeks and moved his hands down so that he was both pulling her more tightly into himself and rubbing her cunt and clit.

He dipped down slightly, and the head of his prick slid down into Julie's ass cheeks.&nbsp; He moved back and forth to aligned the head with her virgin rosebud.&nbsp; He thrust forward slightly, not enough to penetrate, but enough to apply pressure and slightly spread the puckered opening.

"Yes, yes," she moaned.&nbsp; "Tonight, I am yours.&nbsp; You are in control.&nbsp; Use me however you want."

It took all the control Kevin had not to slam himself fully into Julie upon hearing those words.&nbsp; Instead he rocked back and forth with her, penetrating her slightly more with each thrust.&nbsp; As his member slowly slid in, Julie began moaning louder and louder.&nbsp; She turned her head and tried to kiss him as he stood behind her, but all she succeeded in doing was to touch tongues for a few fleeting seconds.

Kevin was now fully within her and he continued his slow steady strokes as both he and Julie began moaning louder and louder.&nbsp; The push of his hands against her cunt and his thrusts into her ass became faster and then more and more frantic until Julie was suddenly once again taken up onto tiptoe and beyond.&nbsp; Her feet were now totally off the ground, pulled down only by the tension of the chains attached to the wall.&nbsp; She wailed and shook and vibrated as Kevin held her impaled in his grip.&nbsp; She felt the warm sensation of him ejaculating inside her and screamed out in uncontainable pleasure.

Upstairs on the deck, Sara and Joan were rubbing against one another in the hot tub.&nbsp; Sara stopped,&nbsp; looked over at the cabin, and said, "That didn't sound like a carousel.&nbsp; That sounded much more like a roller coaster."

"So, my little roller coaster rider," murmured Joan.&nbsp; "How would you like to finish the evening?&nbsp; With a coolie?... a hottie?... or a not-so-quickie in the bedroom?"

"I think I will take one from column A, one from column B, and one from column C," answered Sara, and then laughing she ran down the steps of the deck and threw herself into an area of undisturbed snow in the back yard.&nbsp; Joan raced behind her and dove after her into the snowbank.

Kevin, meanwhile, was unwrapping Julie's wrist and ankle cuffs in preparation to carrying her into the bedroom to complete their world tour.

Ron and Judy, Kevin and Julie, Joan and Sara were sitting in the kitchen eating breakfast when Ron's cellphone rang - his regular cellphone, not the snow rescue satellite phone.&nbsp; He stepped away from the table to answer it and came back several minutes later looking upset.

"Well," he said, "do you want the good news first or the bad news."

"Let's go with good first," answered Julie.

"The lodge will be open for business as of 9:00 this morning.&nbsp; They are booked solid and expect to be full to capacity by nightfall."

"And the bad news?" asked Judy.

"They found a problem in the cable for the chair lift on this side of the mountain and it will have to stay shut down for another day at least.&nbsp; It looks like it took a lightning strike in that thundersnow we had just before Christmas and there is a burnt spot in the cable.&nbsp; It takes a special machine to cut out a section and re-splice, so they have to wait for the repair people to get here tomorrow."

"So what does that mean?" asked Julie.

"It means that you have a choice between the bunny hill with its rope pull to get up the little slope or the black diamond slope on the other side.&nbsp; The Mogul Hill is more or less open, but that is 'expert only' even when it has been properly groomed.&nbsp; We can get you up to the lodge, and you can ski back down here to the cabin, but the chairlift on this side is a no go until sometime late tomorrow."

"The bunny hill doesn't sound like much fun, and I don't think I can handle the expert slopes," said Sara.&nbsp; "I will just stay here and watch TV or whatever."

"I'll stay with Sara," said Joan.&nbsp; "We'll find something to do."

"I'll bet you will," snickered Judy.

"Everything doesn't have to be about sex," harumph Julie.&nbsp; "Two people can just sit and watch TV together."

"Maybe the Sara and Joan we knew last week before we came up here could just sit and watch TV together all day," responded Judy, "but I think we have all changed - a lot - in the last few days. "

Sara replied, "There's satellite TV and a strong internet connection.&nbsp; Joan and I are going to research some of her genealogy that we were talking about the other day.&nbsp; It looks like there might be some interesting stuff hidden away in the closets of her family tree."

"Hope you don't find too many horse thieves and ladies of the night buried back there," said Judy as she repressed a laugh.&nbsp; "Who knows what you might turn up if you started digging through my family's closets."

"We could come back early for lunch and see if you have changed your mind." said Ron.

"You four have fun on the slopes," said Joan.&nbsp; "We'll expect you back in about three hours.&nbsp; Sara and I will be OK here."

"We'll be more that OK," started Sara, and the rest joined her to finish with "we'll be fine... mighty fine."

Ron, Judy, Kevin and Julie were still laughing as they walked out onto the deck and down into the yard.

After they had left, Joan turned to Sara and said, "So, does this genealogical research begin with getting out a key that my aunts have hidden in that strange bench of theirs?"

"Like I said," replied Sara, "I'll bet there's some interesting stuff hidden away in your family closets.&nbsp; Why else would they go to so much trouble to hide the key?"

"Maybe so we wouldn't play with their toys like we have with the Jurgensen's." answered Joan.

"It probably isn't dishwasher safe," suggested Sara, "because whatever is in that closet wouldn't fit in the dishwasher.&nbsp; If it wouldn't fit in those big drawers, it has to be something big."

"Shall we begin our research?" asked Joan.

"After you," replied Sara with a bow and a sweep of her hand.

When they got downstairs, Sara said that she would go get the key and walked out into the area under the deck.&nbsp; When she returned, she was carrying the entire bench.&nbsp; "I was thinking...," she began, "This weird bench, or whatever it is, was probably expensive to have made.&nbsp; It has a lot of expensive looking hard wood in it.&nbsp; The very top portion adjusts up and down, and it is reinforced with steel where the wood joins together.&nbsp; I'll bet this has something to do with what is in that little closet."

"So let's see what is in the closet," replied Joan as she set the bench on end and pressed the dark knot in the wood that opened the secret drawer.

Sara and Joan walked together into the bedroom on the left and Joan tried the key in the lock.&nbsp; It unlocked and the door opened downward as though it were hinged on the bottom where it met the floor.&nbsp; But there were no hinges visible.&nbsp; Instead, two pins stuck out from the edges of the bottom of the door and were held in place by open-topped brackets that were attached to the wall.

"It looks like you are supposed to lift it up and out once you have it opened," said Sara.&nbsp; Joan did exactly that.&nbsp; There appeared to be several large boards stacked sideways in the small closet.

"Wait a minute," said Joan, and she opened one of the closet doors.&nbsp; "The floors in the closets have been raised up about two feet so that you can slide something really long in there.&nbsp; Help me drag those boards out into the main room."

With a little tugging, grunting, and groaning, Sara and Joan dragged several large boards out of the closet and into the main downstairs room.&nbsp; They returned and each carried a stack of smaller boards out into the room.&nbsp; There was also a medium-sized wooden box filled with black iron straps and bolts, and a large, padded board that looked like the seat to a strangely shaped chair.

"There's something else big tucked in on the other side," observed Sara.&nbsp; ""There's also a little bench and a big leather box of some sort."&nbsp; She handed the bench and box out to Joan and said, " I think I can slide this other thing out into the bedroom and pick it up."

A few moments later, she carried what looked like a black half-barrel out into the main room.&nbsp; "I didn't realize they were this heavy," she said.&nbsp; "This thing must weight twenty or twenty-five pounds."

"You know what it is?" asked Joan as she set down a black padded bench or stool that seemed to match was Sara was carrying.

"Oh, yeah," answered Sara.&nbsp; "I've seen pictures."

Setting it down she added, "And I've seen some very interesting videos of this thing in action."

"What is it?"

"It's a Sybian."

"But what is it?" asked Joan again.

"It would be a lot easier to see what it is if the attachments were in place," responded Sara as she opened up the black leather case that had also been in the closet.&nbsp; She held up a T-shaped piece of soft, pink plastic and set it on top of the black leather half-barrel.

"It's a vibrator!?" said Joan, her face showing her obvious surprise.

"Oh no," answered Sara, "this is much, much more than just a vibrator.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is the B52 of vibrators.&nbsp; The Sybian is the top of the line, leading edge, female masturbatory machine in all the world.&nbsp; They cost over a thousand dollars and the extras can run that up to almost two thousand.&nbsp; It vibrates, rotates, pulsates and just about every other "ate" except munching on you.&nbsp; These things can give you so much pleasure that they can actually be used for torture."

"No thanks," answered Joan, "I've already had my brains fucked out by machines once this week."

"But I haven't," said Sara with the puppy dog look on her face.&nbsp; Her eyes were glistening over with tears.&nbsp; "Do you think Sandy and Mandy would mind if I gave it a test drive?&nbsp; I'm pretty sure that the attachments can be washed and sanitized even if they can't quite go through a dishwasher."

"I don't think my aunts would mind," said Joan.&nbsp; "... especially if we don't tell them."

Joan looked around the room and continued, "But before you fuck your own brains out with that thousand dollar dildo, let's see if we can figure out what the rest of this stuff is."

"Now that I am thinking heavy duty BDSM," said Sara as she looked around, "I think the long boards we pulled out of the closet are a Saint Andrew's Cross."&nbsp; She pointed at the long, heavy boards on the floor, "See, you can tell where the boards cross and the bolts hold them together in a big X shape.&nbsp; Those shorter boards with the hinges on them must attach to the uprights and the short lengths of chain go between them to hold everything up like a giant artist's easel.&nbsp; That padded thing that looks like the top of a chair is probably the body pad for the center of the cross."

"That leaves those other boards with the half holes in them and all the short pieces with plates and hinges attached to them." said Joan.

Sara walked around the room holding some of the pieces in her hands.&nbsp; Suddenly she turned and walked over to the bench.&nbsp; "This is a base for that," she said, pointing over to the Sybian.&nbsp; That's why it has six legs.&nbsp; The middle legs are to strap your legs to.&nbsp;&nbsp; The metal brackets hold the Sybian in place, and the eyebolts recessed in the end connect to the chains attached to...."&nbsp; She looked around the room and suddenly said, "... those eyebolts halfway up the beams.&nbsp;&nbsp; With or without the Sybian clamped in place, the bench can be held directly between the beams in the center of the room."

She walked around the room some more twisting the large piece of wood in her hands that had one large and two small half-circles cut out of it.&nbsp; "And this is a pillory that mounts on top of the bench if the Sybian isn't there.&nbsp; See, if you put the two big pieces together, they form a big hole for your neck and smaller holes for your wrists."

She went over to the bench and turned some of the adjustments.&nbsp; "This can be raised to almost five feet in the air.&nbsp; It wouldn't have to go that high just to make a Sybian horse, but if this pillory were clamped in place, it would be just the right height."

Sara put her hands on her hips and faced Joan.&nbsp; "Your aunts, Sandy and Mandy, are two totally kinky ladies.&nbsp; How did you turn out so straight?"

"If you consider intentionally losing so that I ended up spending an entire night in electro-sex bondage as being 'straight,' I would hate to see what you consider 'twisted.'"

"Stick around," said Sara with a wide grin.&nbsp; "You might get a chance to see just how twisted I can be."&nbsp; She then carried the bench into the center of the room between the two beams with eyebolts and began attaching the leg chains to the four corners.&nbsp; She also attached four chains to the ceiling beams.

"I see how this is supposed to work," she said with a satisfied smile.&nbsp; "See how this bracket goes under the wood and slips into these brackets on the ends of the Sybian.&nbsp; Somebody has done some modification to the internal base plate so it can be held firmly in place on this horse rather than just setting it on the floor or on a bed."

Sara set a pad of thick rubber on the top of the bench.&nbsp; It fit exactly.&nbsp; "I'm not sure what this pad is for.&nbsp; Maybe it controls noise or lets the machine vibrate more freely."&nbsp; She had Joan help her set the Sybian in place and together they adjusted the height of the bench so that the top of the device was just below her waist.

She then went over to the accessories case and brought back a medium sized dildo attachment and an almost flat one with a large nub in the center of it.&nbsp; "You could actually remain a virgin and use this machine," she explained.&nbsp; "In fact, with this one," holding up the flat attachment, "you wouldn't even have to take off your clothing."&nbsp; She grinned and added, "If you didn't mind getting everything all wet and gooey."

As she put the dildo attachment in place, she continued to explain to Joan, "The man who invented this says that you don't really need anything ramming inside you for the orgasm of your life.&nbsp; That's why it vibrates and rotates rather than thrusting like a man.&nbsp; If I could find a man who could rotate and vibrate, maybe I would switch sides."

Sara checked that everything was properly in place and said, "I will start with this one and work up to the double penetration one or maybe even that extra large monster."

"Don't wear out my aunt's expensive machines," said Joan sarcastically.&nbsp; 

"I think I am going to do a Julie on you," said Sara.

"What do you mean?" asked Joan.

"I want you to tie me up in this like Sandy and Mandy have it set up for and then take over the controls.&nbsp; You do whatever with the speed, intensity and amount of rotation.&nbsp; I want to show you that I totally trust you."

"Rotation?" replied Joan.

"Yes, rotation," answered Sara.&nbsp; "Weren't you listening?&nbsp;&nbsp; It doesn't just vibrate."&nbsp; She held up her index finger and twirled it in small circles, "It also rotates and wiggles.&nbsp; At full intensity, it is supposed to be able to make a frozen nun climax in just a few minutes."

"Hah!" laughed Joan.&nbsp; "Take my word for it, some of those 'frozen nuns' aren't as chilly as you would think.&nbsp; From the roof deck of one of granddad's summer houses we were able to look down into the valley at the back yard of a convent.&nbsp;&nbsp; They had a big swimming pool back there.&nbsp; There were high walls, so I guess the sisters thought no one could see them in their bikinis.&nbsp; We were the only house overlooking the bluff, and we weren't there most of the time, so I guess they forgot about us."

"Anyway, you could always tell when the mother superior was out of town because when she was gone, so were the suits.&nbsp; I never saw anything else.&nbsp; They weren't kinky or into public sex or anything like that.&nbsp; But they did like to lay around in the sun naked.&nbsp; They probably thought skinny dipping was a mortal sin that would send them straight to hell, but they still did it.&nbsp; The priest probably had to take a cold shower after hearing their confessions that week."

Sara laughed.&nbsp; "I went to public schools, remember?&nbsp; But if I confessed everything I did to a priest, he would probably have to run barefoot and bare assed out into the snow just to cool off."

"So what exactly do you want to do, and when?"&nbsp; Asked Joan.

Sara finished tightening all of the clamps and adjustments on the bench and walked over to the wall to plug in the Sybian.&nbsp; She picked up one of the sets of wrist cuffs.&nbsp; "These cuffs have two sets of D rings on them.&nbsp; That's because they are supposed to connect to two sets of chains, one from each end of the beam.&nbsp; That way my hands are held in place just like the bench is held in place."

She picked up two wide belts that were in the accessory case.&nbsp; "These belts wrap around my ankles and those middle legs on the bench so I can't get up off the Sybian.&nbsp; If you adjusted the bench high enough, it would be pure torture with my cunt carrying my whole weight on that pounding ridge.&nbsp; But I have it set so I can keep some or most of my weight on my legs."

"So all you have to do is strap me in place, turn it on, and turn me on."&nbsp; Sara giggled.&nbsp; "I really want to see what my inner fire does when it is dealing with pure pleasure rather than a mix of pleasure and pain."

"If you really want to do this, I'll do it for you."

"I want it," answered Sara as she swung her leg up over the Sybian, impaled herself on the dildo, and settled down into the "saddle."

"OK" said Joan as she began to wrap the wrist cuffs around Sara's wrists.&nbsp; After she had them in place she reached up and pulled one of the chains over to one of the cuffs.&nbsp; Since she was in front of Sara, she attached the chains from that side first, and they pulled Sara forward on the Sybian, but after Joan had stretched the second set of chains over and snapped them in place, Sara was held very upright on the machine.

She asked, "Are you seated where you need to be?"

Sara answered, "Yes," and Joan bound Sara's legs to the center legs of the bench.
"Wait," said Sara.&nbsp; "This isn't right.&nbsp; With my hands held tight like this, I can't bend forward and there is way too much pressure against my front inside from the dildo.&nbsp; Maybe we have to go with that flat nubbly thing."

"Or maybe you didn't have everything figured exactly right," answered Joan as she moved Sara's foot forward and set it on a small ledge a little ways up from the bottom of the front leg.&nbsp; Joan strapped the foot in place and did the same to the other leg.&nbsp; Sara now looked like she were riding a very strange motorcycle.&nbsp; Sara must have thought the same thing because she said, "Vroom, Vroom," and twisted her hand like she were controlling the throttle of a bike.

"Let's see what this does," said Joan, "and what you do in response."

She switched the unit on and the Sybian began humming softly under Sara.&nbsp; She increased the amplitude of the vibration and Sara said, "Wow!"

Joan said sweetly, "Let's see what this control does."

Sara pulled against her wrist restraints and said, "Ah!&nbsp; I can feel that moving inside me."

Joan played with the controls for a little while and the sound of the machine - and Sara - varied in tone and intensity.&nbsp; Finally she was more or less satisfied with the combination and stood in front of Sara.

Sara began to moan slightly and said, "That is really intense."

Joan moved the controls again and Sara began saying "Yes... yes... yes..."&nbsp; She looked up at Joan and said, "Pure pleasure is much better than pure pain."&nbsp; After taking a deep breath she went on, "... the right mixture of pleasure and pain is really nice, too."

She tilted her head back so that her throat was totally open and moaned deeply.&nbsp; "But pure pleasure is really, really, really nice."&nbsp;&nbsp; 

Joan watched as Sara then began to go into the pleasure as she had so often gone into the pain - giving her body to it... swaying with the sensations boiling within her... letting her body and mind soar together and separately upward into the source of her inner fire.

"Just leave it at that level and let me float here for a while," she murmured to Joan.&nbsp; "Right now, I want this to go on forever."

"Forever is a long time," said Joan.&nbsp; "I am going to go soak in the hot tub and will be back in 15 minutes."

Sara's only response was a long "mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm" as she undulated her body between her wrists which were held in place by the chains and her pelvis which was held in place by the Sybian's upright dildo.
Joan started to leave, but Sara called out to her, "Joan, before you go, let me see your body.&nbsp; I want to imagine your body as I go higher and higher."

Joan laughed.&nbsp; "Sara, you are weird..., but OK."&nbsp; She quickly slipped off her sweatsuit and underwear and stood in front of Sara.

"Like what you see?" she asked as she turned slowly around.&nbsp; When she was again facing her, Sara gave her what could only be described as a smile of contentment and then closed her eyes and once again went back to a long "mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm" as she swayed in the Sybian saddle.

Joan blew her a kiss and walked up the steps to the hot tub.&nbsp; Fifteen minutes later she traveled back across the deck to re-enter the cabin and check on Sara.&nbsp; She gasped, however, when the door would not slide open for her.&nbsp; Despite tugging at the door and slamming her fists against the glass, it would not open.

She ran frantically down the steps of the deck and around to the front of the cabin.&nbsp; Running up the front steps she grabbed the handle of the front door, but it, too, would not budge.&nbsp; The front door was locked!

She thought of the car and driving up to the lodge for help.&nbsp; The fact that she was nude wouldn't have stopped her, but the keys were inside the cabin.&nbsp; She thought of running to a neighboring cabin, but the closest was almost a mile away by road, and she had no guarantee that anyone would be there.&nbsp; She ran back around to the door beneath the deck.&nbsp; It might be open... but it wasn't.

Finally she walked dejectedly back up onto the deck, and to stay warm, submersed herself in the hot tub while she tried to think of some way to get back into the cabin.&nbsp; She lost track of how many times she walked around the cabin trying to find some way to get in or break in.&nbsp; Had the deck chairs not been firmly attached to the deck to prevent theft, she would have thrown one of them through the patio door.&nbsp; She looked for a large rock or tree limb or anything which she could use to break a window, but everything was frozen under the snow.

When the snowmobiles finally came into the yard, Joan was curled up against the patio door beating softly on it with her fists and crying.

Ron and Kevin came running up the onto the deck.&nbsp; Kneeling down beside her, Ron asked, "Joan, what's wrong?&nbsp; What's happened?"

Between sobs, Joan replied, "I accidentally locked myself out of the cabin and Sara is inside on a sex machine.&nbsp; She's been there for almost three hours."&nbsp; Joan was now totally blubbering,.&nbsp; "I tried to get back in, but I couldn't.&nbsp; I couldn't even break the glass in the door."

"Why didn't you use the emergency key?" asked Julie.&nbsp; "You told us about it on the way up here.&nbsp; It's taped in place under the deck rail by the hot tub controls."
Joan shut to her feet, "Oh my God!&nbsp; How could I have forgotten."

She ran across the deck and clawed at the area under the deck rail.&nbsp; There was a wide double strip of something like duck tape with an edge folded over so she could get hold of it.&nbsp; She peeled it off and beneath it, wrapped in plastic wrap, was a key.&nbsp; She ran back to the patio door and inserted the key.

"It's already unlocked," she screamed.&nbsp; "Why won't it open?"

Kevin, looking through the glass, said, "The safety bar has fallen down into the track.&nbsp; The door won't open."

"The front door will," cried Joan as she ran down the steps of the deck and through the snow to the front door.&nbsp; A moment later she was running across the cabin to lift the safety bar to allow Ron and Kevin in.&nbsp; 

"She might be hurt!" screamed Joan.&nbsp; "Please come help me."

The five of them ran downstairs.

Sara was drenched in sweat and humming softly to herself.&nbsp; As they ran over to her, she opened her eyes and said, "Hello Joan.&nbsp; It started getting painful a little while ago."

She continued to explain with a dreamy expression on her face,&nbsp; "But by then my inner fire could have melted steel, so I just went into the pain and mixed it with the pleasure while I waited for you to come back.&nbsp; Did something happen?&nbsp; Are you OK?"

Joan was crying, "No, Sara, are YOU OK?"

"Let's get her out of this," said Kevin and he and Ron started unfastening chains and straps.&nbsp; Joan picked up the control and the Sybian went silent.

Ron and Kevin lifted Sara off the Sybian saddle and set her on the couch.&nbsp; "I'm going into my doctor mode here," said Ron.&nbsp;&nbsp; "I'm not being a dirty old man.&nbsp; I need you to spread your legs so I can check for damage."

"I don't mind," answered Sara.&nbsp; "I have no inhibitions, remember?"

Ron reached out and slightly spread Sara's labia.&nbsp; "There is some bruising," he said, "but she is basically OK."&nbsp; Turning to Sara, he added, "I would stay off that thing at least for the rest of the day, however."

"Anything you say," she replied.&nbsp; "You're the doctor."

"Not yet," he answered, "but definitely don't try to wear out that machine.&nbsp; I don't think even you can do that."

He helped her to her feet.&nbsp; Joan, still crying softly, embraced her.&nbsp; As they hugged she said, "I am so sorry.&nbsp; I panicked.&nbsp; I could have gotten back in here hours ago if I had just kept my head."

"That's OK," responded Sara as she hugged her.&nbsp; "I could have stayed there for a lot longer."

"But then you might not be able to walk for a while," added Ron.

"It would have been worth it"

Sara looked around at everyone and said, "And now it's time for me to fix you all some lunch.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will get out some sandwich stuff while you get your coats and stuff hung up.&nbsp; Then you can&nbsp; join me in the kitchen."

A little while later the six were sitting around the table eating.&nbsp; Ron said, "Did you ladies bring something nice to wear?"

"What do you mean?" asked Joan.

"The boss said Kevin and I and our guests or family are supposed to attend a special banquet at eight tonight at the lodge.&nbsp; That idiot we rescued is evidently a rich idiot, and he wants to show his appreciation for saving him and his family."

"I don't have anything really fancy," answered Julie.

"Fancy up here is clean and dry," said Kevin.&nbsp; "A nice, light weight sweat suit would be acceptable.&nbsp; A dress would be better."&nbsp; He laughed and added, "But you can forget about high heels unless you carry them into the lodge in a bag.&nbsp; Heels really don't work in the snow."

"You get us back here by six tonight, and we will be ready by seven thirty." said Judy.&nbsp; "If you have a car, you can pick us up, or the four of us will drive up to the lodge and meet you there."

"I think it would be best to meet at the lodge," answered Ron.&nbsp; That way Kevin and I can change into something at our rooms in the aid station building.&nbsp; We will meet you at the front entrance to the lodge at 7:45."

"So, what's up for this afternoon?" asked Joan.

"You guys could come with us and try the upper slopes," suggested Kevin.

"It would keep Sara off the sex machines," added Judy.

"I'll wait until the lower slopes are open," answered Sara.&nbsp; "What are you guys going to do?"

"Kevin is going to complete his qualification for the e-cass," chirped Judy.&nbsp; "I've volunteered to be the patient, so I get to ride in the sled with Ron."

"That isn't as great a prize as you think," said Ron.&nbsp; "It really bounces around back there, and part of the certification is that you have to take the sled up and down each of the three main slopes.&nbsp; That includes the Mogul slope."

He turned to Joan and Sara and continued, "Technically, Kevin and I are now off-duty now.&nbsp; We left the e-cap up at the aid station with one of the other teams.&nbsp; When we leave here after lunch, Judy and Joan will be riding my machine and Kevin will be towing me in the e-cass.&nbsp; We will make a run up and down a couple of the slopes and then I will write up the evaluation.&nbsp;&nbsp; We'll leave the e-cass at the aid station, and then, assuming someone doesn't need it, after we ski for a while, we will go back and Judy and I will get in the back while Kevin and Julie ride up front.&nbsp; For the qualification test a rider up front is allowed, since sometimes you have to bring back someone with the injured party and they might have to ride with you."

"So, you guys ski and qualify, and Sara and I watch TV or whatever."

"I saw whatever set up downstairs," said Judy.&nbsp; "Just make sure that one of you doesn't get trapped outside while the other one is tied to that cross in the basement."

"Oh, we wouldn't use that cross this afternoon," answered Sara with a grin.

She paused until everyone was looking at her.&nbsp; "But there is a pillory that goes on the bench in place of the Sybian."

"You two!" said Julie.

"Don't knock it until you've tried it," answered Sara.

"Well it's time for us to hit the slopes," interjected Ron.&nbsp; "We should be back here around six to drop off Judy and Julie."&nbsp; He got up and began gathering his boots and coat. "See you then," he added and then said, "Oh, almost forgot."&nbsp; He walked over to the door and lifted the upright safety bar totally out of the track.&nbsp; "You are supposed to hang this on the hook on the wall to keep it from accidentally falling back down into the track and locking you out."

When Joan looked up at him, he added, "You aren't the first person we've had to rescue outside in the snow after the patio doors locked them out."

"You aren't even the first naked person we have had to rescue," said Kevin.&nbsp; "I don't think I will ever forget that hugely obese fifty-five year old man from last year," he added with a shudder.

"That's because you want to remember that twenty-three year old model he had in the hot tub with him," replied Ron with a laugh.

"There's that too," responded Kevin as he put on his boots.&nbsp; A few minutes later, the whine of snowmobile engines faded off into the distance.

Sara was cleaning up the kitchen while Joan continued to sit at the table.&nbsp; After a little while Sara turned to her and asked, "What's bothering you?"

"I screwed up!" she answered.&nbsp; "You trusted me, and I screwed up.&nbsp; You could have been badly hurt because of my stupidity."

"The safety brace falling into the track was an accident.&nbsp; You can't blame yourself for that."

"But I CAN blame myself for panicking and forgetting about the emergency key," wailed Joan.&nbsp; "I would never be able to forgive myself if something had happened to you because of my mistake."

"I forgive you.&nbsp; Just let it all be in the past," said Sara as she sat down at the table with her.&nbsp; She took Joan's hand. "But it looks like you already can't forgive yourself."

"I DON'T forgive myself," cried Joan.&nbsp; "I can barely look at you without thinking that I could have really hurt you bad with my stupidity.&nbsp; I need to do something to make it up to you so we can both move on and let it be in our past.&nbsp; This may be nothing to you, but it is a giant wall to me."

"Sometimes the slave must teach the master," said Sara softly.&nbsp; Then she asked, "Are you asking to be punished?

"No..., yes..., maybe..., I don't know," replied Joan.&nbsp; "but I need to do something so that my guilt is balanced out."

"Sometimes, for some people, forgiveness is not enough.&nbsp; If you really want me to punish you, I will.&nbsp; What kind of punishment do you have in mind?"

"Nothing..., something..., " Joan suddenly raised her head.&nbsp; "The pillory!....&nbsp; I want you to put me in the pillory for the same amount of time that you were on the Sybian."&nbsp;&nbsp; She stopped and looked up at the ceiling as if she were reading something or trying to remember something important.&nbsp; "And I want you to use one of the paddles on me... ten swats every ten minutes.&nbsp;&nbsp; And I don't want to be able to change my mind, so use one of the ball gags."

"I was on that Sybian for two and one-half hours.&nbsp; That's 150 minutes.&nbsp; That would be 150 swats."

"160 actually," replied Joan.&nbsp; "If you count the ten at the start."

"Do you really want to do this?" asked Sara.

"That question seems to be getting asked a lot lately," answered Joan.&nbsp; "Yes, let's do this."

They both went back downstairs.&nbsp; Joan stripped off her sweatsuit.&nbsp; She had not bothered to put underwear back on after they had rescued Sara.&nbsp; Sara was still wearing nothing but her collar.

"Help me take this apart," said Sara as she started loosening clamps and brackets.&nbsp; After they had lifted the Sybian off the bench, they began assembling the pillory that mounted in its place.

"I think this platform thing goes on first," said Sara.

"Then what are those holes for?" asked Joan pointing toward two large holes on the flat, padded base.

"Well," replied Sara, "If your head is on that end and you are bent over, something on your anatomy is going to be hanging down about there."&nbsp; She had set the platform in place and put her hand through one of the holes.

"Oh," said Joan as she handed Sara more pieces of wood.

"This forms a pad for your shoulders so you don't accidently damage your windpipe while your head is in the stocks."

"You seem to know how this is supposed to work, Sara, so I want you to set me up right and punish me like I said."

"Do you want the full set up?" asked Sara.

"Yes," answered Joan.&nbsp; "But don't tell me what it is.&nbsp; Just do it."

"OK," said Sara as she tightened the last bracket into place.&nbsp; "Let's adjust this to your height as you are bent over."

Joan bent over the now complete apparatus and set her head in the large half-circle and her wrists in the two smaller half-circles.&nbsp; She could feel the padding on the front of the platform pressing lightly against her thighs and the slightly higher padded step pressing against her chest just above her breasts.

"Those other cuffs in the accessories box," said Sara with a note of surprise in her voice.&nbsp; "The ones without the attachment rings.&nbsp; I see what they are for now."

She ran back into the bedroom and returned with two wrist cuffs.&nbsp; They were almost identical to the others except they had no attachment rings on them.&nbsp; They did, however, have a rather high ridge that ran along the outer edge of both sides of the cuff.

"Let me put these on you," said Sara as she wrapped the cuffs around Joan's wrists.&nbsp; When Joan again placed her wrists in the half-circles, the wood of the stocks fit exactly in the groove formed by the ridges on the edges of the cuffs.

"And that explains what that big thing is," said Sara as she went back into the bedroom and returned with what appeared to be an oversized version of the wrist cuffs.&nbsp; "This goes around your neck," she said.&nbsp; "Of course, not very tightly, but it acts as a pad so you don't get bruised or cut by the stocks if you thrash around... or should I say WHEN you thrash around."

Joan stood up and Sara wrapped the neck cuff somewhat loosely around her.&nbsp; She then put her neck and wrists back into the stocks.

"Now all I have to do is put the upper board in place and you are all set.&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, almost all set."

Sara put the upper half of the stock in place.&nbsp; There were two threaded rods which fit through holes in the lower half and protruded downward an inch or so beneath it.&nbsp; Sara threaded a washer and large wing nut over the post and tightened it in place.

She then went upstairs for something and returned a moment later and said, "I'm setting this timer for ten minutes.&nbsp; Every time it rings, you get ten swats.&nbsp; In the meantime, I will be riding the Sybian - with it set on a very low setting - and will be taking in pure pleasure."

Sara then came around in front of Joan.&nbsp; "Now that I have you totally secured, we can finish the set up.&nbsp; First the ball gag so you can't object or change your mind.&nbsp; Last chance to back out."

Joan said, "Do it.&nbsp; You may not need to punish me to forgive me, but I need to be punished to forgive myself.&nbsp; Just do it!"

"OK," said Sara as she put the gag in place.&nbsp; Then she held something up in front of Joan.&nbsp; They looked like oversize old fashioned earrings with the screw thread that tightened onto the earlobe.&nbsp; The dangley part, however, looked more like a fish weight than a decoration.&nbsp; It even had "5 oz" imprinted on its side.

Sara reached under Joan and began to attach the nipple clamps. Joan grunted.&nbsp; "They have to be tight enough so that they don't drop off as they swing.&nbsp; The reason that the holes for your tits are so large is because they will bounce when you ass bounces.&nbsp; These will swing as your tits swing and add to the punishment."

"Of course, if it were me in there and you were working on me with a dildo or a strap-on, I would probably like the sensation."

Sara stood back in front of Joan.&nbsp; "The final accessory," she said, holding up a blindfold.&nbsp; She put it in place and announced, "Now we are ready."

Joan was now in darkness.&nbsp; She tried to remain still so that the weights on the nipple clamps would stop swinging.&nbsp; They had finally come to rest when she heard Sara say "One," and her ass exploded in pain.&nbsp; Sara swung at a steady, measured pace.&nbsp; After the fourth swing, Joan noticed that the nipple weights swung exactly four times between each swat.

"I am really stupid," she thought to herself.&nbsp; "I was stupid for not removing the safety bar from the patio doors.&nbsp; I was stupid for not remembering the emergency key.&nbsp; I was stupid for not forgiving myself.&nbsp; And I was REALLY stupid for setting my punishment at 160 swats over a period of an two and a half hours."

Sara finally said, "Ten," and Joan tried to stop her dancing feet so the nipple weights would stop swinging.&nbsp; It helped to count the swings as the clamps tugged at her nipples.&nbsp; "Eleven," she said to herself when they finally stopped swinging.&nbsp; Now it was just a matter of waiting for the next round of her punishment.

As she waited, she could hear the Sybian began to hum softly.&nbsp; Soon Sara was also humming.

The timer rang and the humming of both the Sybian and Sara stopped.&nbsp; "Time to get back to work," said Sara softly.&nbsp; A few moments later she said, "One," much more loudly and Joan yelled into the gag as the paddle slammed into her asscheeks and the nipple weights began swinging wildly.

Joan was crying heavily into her gag by the time Sara said, "Ten."&nbsp;&nbsp; Then Joan heard the Sybian again start up and shortly thereafter Sara's happy humming filled the room.

"I think she knows exactly what she is doing," thought Joan.&nbsp; "She knows that I feel guilty that I caused her pain, and she is following my orders to punish me, but at the same time, she is showing me that she also had pleasure in that pain and I didn't really damage her ability to get pleasure, even from the Sybian."&nbsp; Joan shifted her legs slightly and the nipple weights began swinging again.&nbsp; "Why didn't I just sit and talk this over with her."

Joan had a lot of time to think and Sara had a lot of time to hum as the cycle was repeated over and over again.&nbsp; Finally the timer rang and Sara announced, "Last set."&nbsp; Then she said, "Before I start this one, I am going to remove these."

Joan felt Sara's fingers on the nipple clamps and then they both came free.&nbsp; Her nipple burned intensely from the rush of blood back into them.

Sara explained, "I thought you might want to have something to take your mind off the tingle while they get back to normal."&nbsp; Then she announced the first swat.&nbsp; 

After the second swat, Joan was wishing that Sara had left the nipple weights in place.&nbsp; Without the distraction of the pain of the swinging weights tugging at her nipples, the pain of the swat seemed to be that much more intense.&nbsp; Or maybe it was because she had already received over 150 swats by that time.

Joan was dancing and writhing from the paddling when she heard Sara say, "Let's get you out of that."&nbsp; It was over.

Sara removed the blindfold and then the ball gag.&nbsp; Then she unscrewed the rods that held the top of the pillory stock in place.&nbsp; As she took the top half off the stocks, Sara said, "Don't stand up yet.&nbsp; You will probably get dizzy and I don't want you falling and breaking something.&nbsp; Ron and Kevin might not understand.

"I don't really understand," answered Joan.&nbsp; "But now there is nothing between us but what we want to have there.&nbsp; My guilt is gone.&nbsp; Only my love is left."

"Your guilt was probably gone at around 25 swats," responded Sara. "but I would have kept going to five hundred if I knew that's what it took to get you to say you love me."

"How long have you loved me?" asked Joan.

"Since before I knew what love was," answered Sara, "And I would have still loved you if you had fallen in love with some man and married him.&nbsp; You don't choose who you love.&nbsp; And you can't choose who will love you."

"I've always known that I more than liked you," said Joan with deep emotion in her voice.&nbsp; "But everyone - including me - expected me to meet 'Mr Right' someday and settle down and raise a family."

"You are my 'Ms Right,'" said Sara, almost crying.&nbsp; "And I could be your 'Mrs Right,' if you wanted me."

"We will see," said Joan as she stood upright and drew in a very deep breath.&nbsp; "In the meantime, Ms Right needs to soak her sorry ass in a very cold bath so maybe I won't have to stand through dinner tonight."

"Why cold water when there is all that ice cold snow out there?" replied Sara.

When Joan raised her eyebrows, Sara added, "No sex.&nbsp; I won't even come out with you.&nbsp; But right now, the snow is probably the best ice pack your blistered butt ever had.&nbsp;&nbsp; Go freeze your ass a little to stop the pain and swelling and then you can go up and take a shower to wash away the sweat and stink.&nbsp; I'm going to take the Sybian horse out for a full gallop to top things off and then I will clean up and get dressed."

As Joan went through the doorway under the deck to go out into the snow, she could hear a very loud humming noise from the Sybian vibrator and almost immediately a very loud wail from Sara.

1Three J's and an S Go Skiing - Day 6, Part 2 By The Technician

BDSM&nbsp;&nbsp; FFF/F&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; D/s&nbsp; /&nbsp; Mild&nbsp; / Snow&nbsp; /&nbsp; Cold&nbsp; / Another Interlude with no sex.

 = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Four young college girls on a skiing vacation have to find other things to do when an excess of new snow traps them in their cabin.&nbsp; This is the ninth in this series and continues the adventures of The Three J's and Sara at Mountain Lodge Resort.

This story might make more sense if you have read the previous days of "Three J's and an S Go Skiing," especially "Three J's and an S Go Skiing Day 6 Part 1."

Again, there is basically NO SEX IN THIS SEGMENT.&nbsp; This is the second half of what was supposed to be a minor plot and character development.&nbsp; I may turn these stories into a book someday, so I am leaving the section, but putting it in its own segment that you can just skip if you want to. 

 If you just want the sex skip to Three J's and an S Go Skiing - Day 6, Part 3.&nbsp; Judy and Julie tell the others what happened in the afternoon and Sara tries to get things back in balance in the red ass cheeks department..

For the most part, the stories in this series are pretty mild.

It was after 7:00 when the snowmobiles came roaring back into the yard.&nbsp; Judy and Julie jumped off and scampered up the steps into the cabin while Ron and Kevin turned the units around and roared back up the hill.

"You're running really late," observed Joan and they hurried into the cabin.

"We know!&nbsp; We know!" they both yelled in unison.&nbsp; "We'll explain everything later."

"Joan and I have already showered and gotten most of the way ready," yelled Sara.&nbsp; We will stay out of your way."

"Yeah," said Joan to herself.&nbsp; "All I have to do is figure out what I can wear under this skirt."&nbsp; She was currently standing in an off-white pleated skirt with a bright red blouse above it.&nbsp; She was carefully wiping off a pair of four inch heels that exactly matched the skirt.&nbsp; Beneath the skirt was an equally bright red bottom and nothing else.

Joan had returned to the snow in the back yard several times since she ordered Sara to punish her.&nbsp; Sitting in the snow took away the sting, but sitting anywhere else was brutal.&nbsp; She walked into the living room and looked at herself in the mirror.&nbsp;&nbsp; She fluffed her hair slightly and then turned around, lifted the skirt, and looked at herself in the mirror over her shoulder.&nbsp; The globes of her ass were red and swollen with dark purple splotches starting to form right on her "sit spot."

Sara came into the room.&nbsp; "I should have stopped after 25," she said.&nbsp; "I knew you had been punished enough, but you said ten every ten minutes for two and a half hours, so I kept going."&nbsp; She hung her head and lifted up her eye at Joan like a small child caught by a parent.&nbsp; "Besides, for each of those ten minutes, I was riding the Sybian up to the heights of heaven."

She sighed and stepped forward with her hand held out.&nbsp; Joan didn't quite catch what she said at first, but as Sara placed something in her palm, she said "These will help take away the pain.&nbsp; They are left over from when I screwed up my back last summer.&nbsp; They are really powerful, but NO alcohol.&nbsp; Without any alcohol, these things will get your buzz on, but with even one drink, not only will it totally blotto you, it can kill you."

Joan took the two pills and walked back into the kitchen for some water.&nbsp; After taking the pills, she went over to the stairway to the basement.&nbsp;&nbsp; "I'm going to go downstairs for a few minutes and sit on an ice pack," she told Sara as she started down the steps.

"Take a towel with you,' said Sara, as she started down the steps.&nbsp; "Or you will get that skirt wet when you put it back on."

"Got it covered," answered Joan.
Joan entered the basement area, took off her skirt and draped it over the couch, and then, naked from the waist down, went outside through the doorway under the deck.&nbsp; She walked a little ways out into the snow and sat down.&nbsp;&nbsp; There were several other depressions in the snow nearby where she had "sat on an ice pack" earlier in the day.&nbsp; Unlike Sara, the icy feel of the snow was not pleasurable to her, but it did temporarily kill the pain and was definitely helping to control the swelling.

As she sat in the snow, she could feel the pills beginning to take effect.&nbsp; She could also feel the snow melting between her legs and becoming slightly slushy against her and pushing further up into her ass cheeks and the cleft of her sex.&nbsp; "Sara would really like that," she said to herself, "but I am starting to get uncomfortable."&nbsp;&nbsp; With that she got up and went back into the basement.

Joan dried herself with the towel she had taken into the basement earlier, and stood around for a few minutes making sure that she was totally dry before she put her skirt back on and went back upstairs.&nbsp;&nbsp; As she climbed the stairs, she felt slightly light headed, almost dizzy.&nbsp; "Whoa," she thought to herself.&nbsp; These pills are good stuff.&nbsp; It's a wonder that Sara didn't share them earlier."

When she got back upstairs, Sara was holding a bag with four sets of heels in it, and a small clutch handbag.&nbsp; She called out, "Judy and Julie are almost ready.&nbsp; Julie used her remote starter thingy so the car is warming up.&nbsp; We won't have to wear coats for the few minutes up to the lodge."&nbsp; She then looked over at Joan and asked, "Are you carrying a purse, or do you want me to keep that extra pain pill in mine?"

"Extra?" asked Joan.

"Didn't you hear me tell you 'One for now, one for later.'?"

"Oops," said Joan with a slight giggle.

"Definitely no alcohol," replied Sara.&nbsp; "I'll put my bottle of pills in my purse, but I don't think feeling pain is going to be your problem tonight.&nbsp; You are so 'not feeling any pain' right now."

Judy called out from the front door, "Time to go.&nbsp; We said we would meet them at the entrance to the lodge at 7:45."

The four girls hurried down the front steps and into the car.&nbsp; Since it was Julie's dad's car, she drove.&nbsp; When they got to the lodge, the parking lot was fairly full and they had to park a little ways from the door.&nbsp; "Good thing we didn't just stay barefoot," said Julie, looking at the thin layer of snow covering the parking area.

"What do you mean, we?" answered Sara.&nbsp; Joan, Judy and Julie were wearing tennis shoes.&nbsp; Sara&nbsp; got out of the car barefooted.&nbsp; Ron and Kevin were waiting for them just inside the door.

Noticing the bag that Sara was carrying, Kevin said, "I was only joking about carrying your heels in a bag.&nbsp; The tennis shoes would have been OK."&nbsp; After a withering glare from The Three J's and Sara, he turned to Ron and muttered, "Women....."&nbsp;&nbsp; 

Ron just smiled and held out his hand for Judy.&nbsp; "Sara, you can check that bag with the tennis shoes in it at the coat check."&nbsp; Seeing that there were only three pairs of shoes in the bag, he added, "Did somebody forget something?"

"Oh, somebody definitely forgot something," answered Sara with one of her lopsided grins.&nbsp; "It was windy in the parking lot," she added and grinned over at Joan who suddenly turned just a few shades less red than her blouse.&nbsp; "But I," continued Sara, "intentionally left my tennies down at the cabin so there are only three pairs to check."

As she walked over to the coat check, Ron and Kevin turned toward each other and raised their eyebrows.&nbsp; Kevin asked, "Do you have any idea what she is talking about?"

"I don't think I want to know," answered Ron.

Together they both muttered, "Women..."

The main hall of the lodge had been set up for a banquet and it was packed.&nbsp; "How did they get so many people invited is so short a time?" asked Judy.

"Mr Montrose invited them," answered Ron.&nbsp; "There is a picture of his father over the fireplace.&nbsp; They are the family that donated most of this mountain to the state for a park and backed the building of the resort.&nbsp; Big money... old money."

"And people just came?" asked Julie.

"There was an announcement taken to all the rooms and cabins saying that Mr Montrose wanted to celebrate the reopening of the resort after the storm and was inviting everyone to a free banquet at the lodge at 8:00 pm." answered Kevin.

"Free food... free booze," added Ron.&nbsp; "That will pull in a crowd every time its tried.&nbsp; We really need to get to our seats."

They had just gotten themselves seated when the wait staff swarmed among the tables.&nbsp; There was a choice of several entree's and several different choices for wine.&nbsp; When Joan started to order a glass of wine, Sara cut in with "No alcohol tonight for Joan.&nbsp; She is already feeling no pain from some pain pills that you can't mix with alcohol."

"Forgot," said Joan.&nbsp; "I guess it's water or 7up for me tonight."

"Why the pain pills?" asked Ron.

"It's nothing," explained Sara.&nbsp; "Besides, it's all behind her now."

Joan shot a very stern stare at Sara.

Kevin started to ask something else, but Ron gave him a quick look indicating that they should shut up while they were ahead.

Following the meal, everyone sat around talking for a while until someone approached the microphone at the head table and asked for everyone's attention.&nbsp; "That's the idiot from the car," said Ron.

Kevin looked back and forth between Ron and the man at the microphone, "Isn't that Mr. Montrose?" he finally asked.

"Ladies and Gentlemen," the speaker began.&nbsp; "Some of you may recognize me, or may note the strong family resemblance to my father whose portrait hangs over the main fireplace here in the lodge.&nbsp; And I think that all of you heard what happened the other day.&nbsp; So.... half of you are probably thinking 'How can anyone that rich be that stupid?'&nbsp; And the other half are probably asking yourself, 'How can anyone that stupid be that lucky.'"

He looked out over the crowd and made a hand gesture pointing to several of the tables in the front.&nbsp; "I am here tonight because of these people," he continued.&nbsp; "I did something extremely stupid and extremely dangerous.&nbsp; I didn't know how stupid it was until my go-anywhere-at- anytime all wheel drive SUV bogged down in the snow.&nbsp; I didn't know how dangerous it was until an avalanche tumbled that 8000 lb SUV down the mountain like it was an acorn.&nbsp; I am very rich, but I did what I did because I was an idiot, and my family and I are alive because we were lucky enough to have these people in our world."

He paused to look once again at the tables.&nbsp; "One man... and then eight more, came out to rescue us from my idiocy.&nbsp; They knew how stupid it was to be on that road.&nbsp; They knew how dangerous it was to be there.&nbsp; And yet they came out to where an idiot had buried an SUV on a closed road.&nbsp; They didn't do what they did because they were idiots; they did what they did because they were heros.&nbsp; I don't know who said it, but I read it on a plaque somewhere, 'A hero is just a person who is brave enough to do their duty when duty calls.'&nbsp; This idiot... this very rich idiot would like to thank you heros for bravely doing your duty."

He held up several envelopes in his hands.&nbsp; "For the county plow driver, Mr Harold Watson... for the state rescue workers, Mr David Long and Mr Robert Watson - cousin of Harold's.... for the county rescue workers, Mr Wyat Thompson, Mr Larry Michelson, Mr William Polk, and MISS Shirley Jones... and especially for Snow Rescue EMTs Ron Jeffry and Kevin James, I have, in each of these envelopes, a certified check for $250,000.&nbsp;&nbsp; The taxes are all taken care of and if there are any problems, the card for my lawyer is also in there.&nbsp; Just call them.&nbsp; They will straighten everything out.&nbsp; My people will get with you in a little while and explain how this all will work."

"In addition," he continued, "I have arranged for a 'meritorious admission' to Harvard School of Medicine for Ron and Kevin who are both pre-med students here at the local college."&nbsp; He turned and addressed them directly.&nbsp; "Or if you would rather go to Stanford or Johns Hopkins, I can arrange that also."&nbsp; He smiled out at the crowd.&nbsp; "There are some advantages of being a billionaire, even if you are an idiot billionaire."

Seeing their looks of shock, he went on.&nbsp; "I've checked you two out.&nbsp; Your grades are more than adequate, but schools like that also need a little push from above to get you in.&nbsp; Or, if you would rather go somewhere else, just let my people know.&nbsp; There are still a few medical schools in the country that don't have a building named for my family."

Kevin and Ron just stared at each other with open mouths.&nbsp; "And don't worry about tuition and books and that stuff.&nbsp; All you have to worry about is your living expenses, I will pay the rest."

He then turned back to the crowd and said, "I've always wanted to do something great in my life, but I am too much of a rich, spoiled, self-centered idiot to ever do much except manage money my great-great-grandfather made back in the old days.&nbsp; But these two have already shown that they are willing to give their lives for others.&nbsp; They will make great doctors, and giving the world two great doctors like them may be my only way to bring greatness into the world."

There was a tremendous round of applause, after which Mr Montrose concluded, "Enjoy your dinner and sleep well tonight knowing that there are heros among you."

Ron and Judy, Kevin and Julie, Joan and Sara sat talking excitedly among themselves until two men in dark suits came over and bent down to speak with Ron and Kevin.&nbsp; "I'm sorry Judy," Ron said.&nbsp; "We've got some legal papers to sign and then the lodge wants us to do interviews with the local news media.&nbsp; I think they said something about a news conference tomorrow morning, so it looks like we are stuck up here tonight."

Kevin took Julie's hand.&nbsp; "We're back on duty at the aid station tomorrow morning, so you four are on your own tonight and most of tomorrow.&nbsp; Why don't we meet you back at the cabin for supper.&nbsp; I might use some of my new-found wealth and get some pizzas delivered from town."

Ron asked, "Will you girls be OK on your own tonight?"

"We will be more than OK," they said in chorus, "We will be fine... mighty fine."&nbsp; Their laughter caused people at several surrounding tables to look over wondering what was going on.

Kevin kissed Julie lightly on the lips and Ron gave Judy a quick kiss on the cheek.&nbsp; "See you tomorrow night," they both said as they accompanied Mr Montrose's "people" back into the office area.

"Shall we go?" asked Julie.&nbsp; 

The four of the got up from the table and started toward the door.&nbsp; "I'll go get your tennis shoes from coat check," said Sara.&nbsp; "Unless you want to walk barefoot with me across the snow in the parking lot."
"I'd rather sit bare assed in the snow at the edge of the parking lot," answered Joan.&nbsp; "But I think I will wait until we get home to get bare assed naked."

"You're already bare assed under that skirt," said Sara.&nbsp; "Like I said, it was windy in the parking lot.&nbsp; Half the people here know that you are bare assed under that skirt."

"I didn't hear you say to take only one pill," said Joan, her face turning red.&nbsp; "It kind made me loopy."

"Oh, that explains a lot," said Julie.

"What do you mean?" asked Joan.

"I think she is referring to the fact that you were stroking my breast and legs most of the night." answered Sara.&nbsp; "Those who didn't know you were bare assed, know you have a girl friend."

"I don't have a girl friend," said Joan, standing up very straight.&nbsp; "I have a fiancee."

"That makes three of us," replied Judy.

"I think we have a lot to talk about when we get back to the cabin," said Sara.

Judy, Julie, and Joan handed their heels back to Sara to put in the bag which already held hers.&nbsp; She handed them back their tennis shoes, Joan refused saying, "Put them back in the bag.&nbsp; I'll barefoot it with you.&nbsp; Maybe some of that cold will work its way up to my bare ass and cool things off a little."

Sara stuck her tongue out at an older woman standing nearby who had overheard them and was looking at them with an obvious expression of shock and disgust on her face.&nbsp; Then taking Joan's hand they walked out into the parking lot together.

"So who wants to go first and say what happened for them today?" asked Julie after they got back to the cabin.

"I'll start," said Joan.&nbsp; "It's pretty simple.&nbsp; After you two left with Ron and Kevin, I was feeling so guilty about having let Sara down that I had her punish me by locking me in that pillory downstairs and spanking me... hard... really hard... a little bit too really hard."&nbsp; She turned around and lifted the back of her skirt so that Judy and Julie could see her ass cheeks.

"Wow!" said Judy and Julie together.&nbsp; "No wonder you took those pain pills and wanted to go out and sit in the snow.&nbsp; Your ass is all red and swollen.&nbsp; How many times did you tell Sara to spank you?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
"Ten," answered Joan.&nbsp; Then she added, "Every ten minutes... for two and a half hours."

"Shit!" exclaimed Julie, "That's 150 swats."

Sara said, "Actually it is 160, if you count the first ten."

Everyone looked at her and she continued, "Only Joan would correct you on that as you are swatting her ass with a paddle."&nbsp; Sara smiled and went on, "Afterwards, she told me that the guilt was gone and all that was left between us was her love for me."&nbsp; She paused for a while before continuing, "And then I said that I had always loved her, and one thing led to another and I guess we sort of proposed to each other."

She looked over at Judy.&nbsp; "When Joan more or less announced our engagement, you said, 'That makes three of us.'&nbsp; So tell us what happened between you and Ron and you and Kevin."

"Kevin asked me to marry him while we were on the chair lift," bubbled Julie.&nbsp; "He said that he felt that I was the one from the moment he met me.&nbsp; We are going to wait until we both get our undergraduate degrees.&nbsp; Before tonight, I was afraid that I might have to put off graduate school for a while.&nbsp; Now all we are trying to figure out is when and how to do the whole 'meet the parents' thing.&nbsp;&nbsp; We figure we should at least let our parents think we are taking it a little bit slow, so we probably won't get rings until spring break."

"Did Ron ask you on the chair lift also, Judy?" asked Joan.

"Not exactly," answered Judy, turning slightly red.

"Oooh, this should be interesting," said Sara.&nbsp; "Tell us all about it."

"When we left here," began Judy, "Ron was in the e-cass behind Kevin, and Julie and I were on Kevin's snowmobile.&nbsp; We followed Kevin up and down the service trails alongside the slopes and finally got to the aid station.&nbsp; We went skiing for a while and then Ron said that we should finish getting Kevin qualified, so we went back to the aid station."

"The e-cass was still hooked up to Ron's snowmobile.&nbsp; Ron opened the back door and told me to slide in on one of the stretchers."

Judy looked around at the other girls, "If the small one is a glass coffin, the e-cass is a glass funeral coach.&nbsp; It is all plexiglass or something.&nbsp; The outside is one of those wrap on plastic things like they use to put advertizing on busses.&nbsp; You can't see inside, but from the inside it is like looking out through tinted glass all around... and above.&nbsp; As I slid in, it was like I was laying on a bench or picnic table outside somewhere."

"Ron slid in beside me and said, 'You might want to hang on.&nbsp; It can get really bumpy in here.'"

"I started to ask him, 'Hang on to what?' when he reached over me and pulled two straps up over me from alongside the stretcher."

"As we started moving, he said, 'I could strap you in, but we don't usually do that unless we are dealing with a drunk or someone who doesn't know what is going on.'"

"'But what if it suddenly gets bumpy.' I asked, and almost immediately Kevin must have gone over some rough snow or something because it got very bouncy in there."

"'In that case,' answered Ron, 'I throw myself over the person and hold them in place.'&nbsp; And he did just that.&nbsp; We were passing skiers going down the hill or just waiting at the edges of the slope."

"'What must this look like to them?' I asked.&nbsp; 'You're laying on top of me.'"

"Ron laughed.&nbsp; 'You can't see in, only out.&nbsp; You could be lying there naked with this parked outside the lodge and no one would notice.&nbsp; We could both be naked going down the slopes and all anyone would see was a red, Snow Rescue, e-cass ambulance.&nbsp; If there were any room in here we could be screwing our brains out and, as long as we weren't too noisy, no one would notice.'"

That image flooded my mind and I started flooding somewhere else.&nbsp; I asked, 'So why can't we screw in here?'"

"'The same reason you can't do much in the bottom bunk of a bunk bed.' he replied.&nbsp; 'No headroom.'"

"We had reached the bottom of the first slope, Kevin stopped and walked back to check on us.&nbsp; There were people right up next to the walls of the e-cass and as Kevin was walking back around to the doors of the e-cass, I suddenly had this image of us lying there fucking while Kevin drove us around among all these people through all the slopes.&nbsp; Ron told Kevin that everything was fine back here, and that's when I knew what I wanted to do.&nbsp; I asked, 'Don't you guys have radios?'"

"Both answered, 'Of course.'&nbsp; So I said, 'Then, Kevin, you just keep going.&nbsp; If anything isn't fine back here we will give you a shout out on the radio.'&nbsp; Kevin said, 'OK,' and went back up to join Julie on the snowmobile."

"As we started moving again, Ron asked, 'What was that about?'"

"Bunk beds don't bounce on their own,' I answered and started skooching out of my clothes."

"'What are you doing!?' he asked and I answered, 'Just get naked and get inside me before the bunk bed starts bouncing.'"

"It took a moment before it finally hit him what I was asking him to do.&nbsp; He said "Oh... OH!" and started trying to get out of his clothes.&nbsp; Luckily for us, a couple of skiers wanted to ask Kevin something and it was a several minutes before we started moving again.&nbsp; By then we were both naked and Ron was trying to slide up on top of me."

"It was such a turn on to be lying there like we were on a picnic table in a public park full of people, and yet no one could see us.&nbsp; I was sooo wet before he even slid over on top of me.&nbsp;&nbsp; He was right.&nbsp; There isn't much head room in that thing.&nbsp; I could barely raise my legs to give him better access, but he got inside me and began sliding slightly up and down on top of me."

"It was nice, but then the e-cass started bouncing and that was terrific.&nbsp; Ron wasn't moving that much in and out of me, but he was really bouncing against my clit.&nbsp; That was a totally different experience, it was taking me higher and higher and higher.&nbsp;&nbsp; And while we were doing this, I could look out the windows on either side or on the top and watch people going by on both sides or on the ski lift above."

"I started cumming and screaming and suddenly Ron clamped his mouth over mine to keep me quiet.&nbsp; It was intense.&nbsp; He was basically lying flat on top of me bouncing with the motion of the sled as we traveled down the rough snow at the edges of the main slopes.&nbsp; For some reason," Judy stopped to give a big grin to the others, "For SOME reason, neither Ron nor I noticed when Kevin got to the bottom of the slope and started to make a wide swing across the flat area to start back up on the other side.&nbsp; The sudden motion rolled us over onto the other stretcher and suddenly I was on top."

"Our legs were a little twisted together, but Ron was still inside me.&nbsp; I tried to bring my legs up under me so I could straddle him, but there just wasn't enough room in that little ambulance.&nbsp; I spread my legs around his and pushed myself up on my arms and just let the bouncing of the e- cass do the work.&nbsp; My breasts were hanging down and Ron reached up and began playing with my nipples.&nbsp; In a little while I was screaming again and then sudden we could hear Kevin's voice on Ron's radio. 'Are you guys OK back there?&nbsp; I thought I heard you yell or something.'"

"Ron dug through his clothes and found his radio and answered, 'Everything's fine.&nbsp; Judy was just enjoying the scenery a little too much.'"

"Kevin answered, 'One more slope and then back to the aid station.&nbsp; I'll let you out of back as soon as we get there.'"

"'Take you time,' answered Ron, 'and don't open the doors when we get back.&nbsp; I will release things from the inside when we are ready to get out.'"

"A little while later, we turned ourselves over and Ron was back on top.&nbsp; As we were bouncing down the last slope, Ron said, 'This isn't exactly how I had planned to do this, but are you willing to marry someone who is almost as crazy you are?'"&nbsp; 

"I said 'Yes.'&nbsp; He wants to take a little bit more time to be sure that there is more to this than just wild, kinky, sex.&nbsp; So, for now, Ron and I are just 'Pinned.'"

"'Pinned?' asked Joan.&nbsp; Ron isn't a member of a fraternity."

"Yes he is," answered Judy, "One of the most exclusive fraternities there is."&nbsp; She pointed to a oval golden pin on her sweatshirt.&nbsp; In the center of the pin was a red square with a white cross on and the words Snow Rescue.&nbsp; "He is a part of the fraternity of heros."

The four of them hugged each other in a group hug for a few minutes and then Julie said, "It is actually getting a bit late.&nbsp; Anyone for a short dip in the hot tub before we head off to bed.?"

Joan answered, "I don't think heat is exactly what my ass needs right now."

"It's what mine needs," said Sara.

Something about the tone of her voice caused The Three J's to turn abruptly to look at her.&nbsp; "What's wrong?" asked Joan.

Sara looked down at the floor.&nbsp; When she raised her face, her eyes were swimming in tears.&nbsp; "When you said that you needed to be punished to remove something that had come between us - on the inside, I was laughing at you.&nbsp; I mean, if you're forgiven, you're forgiven.&nbsp; It's over?&nbsp; Right?"

"But then I over-punished you.&nbsp; I could see that you hadn't realize how painful a full-on ass spanking like that could be.&nbsp; After 25 swats, you had learned your lesson, or whatever it was that you needed.&nbsp; I should have stopped.&nbsp;&nbsp; But I didn't... and it wasn't just because you had told me not to stop."

"I had a ball gag in my mouth.&nbsp; Remember?" said Joan.&nbsp; "I couldn't tell you I had made a mistake or changed my mind."

"You didn't have to tell me, Joan.&nbsp; I knew.&nbsp; I could tell.&nbsp; I knew at 25 you were broken.&nbsp; I should have stopped at thirty, but I wanted to keep going so I could keep going back to sit on that damned Sybian.&nbsp; God!, that machine is pure pleasure.&nbsp;&nbsp; I put my pleasure above your pain, and now I can't stop thinking about it."

"What do you want?" asked Judy.

"I want the three of you to take me down to the Saint Andrews Cross and tie me in place.&nbsp; And then I want each of you to take a paddle and give me ten hard swats.&nbsp; Do it all at the same time so that they come hard and fast and I can't turn that pain into pleasure.&nbsp; Then my butt will match Joan's butt and we can go out and sit in the snow together and say that we love each other.&nbsp; You can laugh at me if you want to, but it's what I need."

She looked up at Joan and whimpered "I laughed at you because I didn't understand.&nbsp; I do now, and it is OK if even you laugh at me, but please do this so we are back in balance."

"You two are going to have a strange and wonderful relationship." said Judy.

"I'm strange," answered Sara, "She's wonderful."

"OK," said Judy.&nbsp; "A little detour to the basement to make Sara's ass all bright and red and burning so it will match Joan's.&nbsp; Then Julie and I will come back up to the hot tub while Joan and Sara go out and melt some snow."

They went down into the basement together.&nbsp; Sara stripped off her dress and underwear.&nbsp; "I wore underwear just so I wouldn't accidentally embarrass any of you at a high class function tonight."

Joan slipped off her skirt and blouse.&nbsp; "But I was the one with the bare ass."&nbsp; Then she added, "Are you sure you want to do this?"

"Yes," said Sara as she stood against the cross and put her arms up against the upper cross pieces.&nbsp; Judy began to strap her arms in place.

Meanwhile Julie came back from the bedroom carrying three paddles.&nbsp; After handing one each to Judy and Joan she said, "Ten, as hard and fast as we can. Right, Sara?"

Sara nodded and The Three J's began swinging.&nbsp; The noise of the paddles striking flesh was loud and fast.&nbsp; Sara was screaming after just the first few swats.&nbsp; On one swat, Judy's paddle actually landed on top of Joan's.&nbsp; She didn't count that one.

After just two or three minutes all three J's said, "Ten!" and stopped their paddling.&nbsp; Sara was hanging slightly limp and crying.

"So that's what pure pain feels like," she said.&nbsp; "Pure pleasure is much, much better."

Joan ran her hand lightly over Sara's bottom.&nbsp; It was hot and red and slightly blistered at one spot.&nbsp; "I think you will need to sit in the snow with me for quite a while tonight."&nbsp; Then she asked, "Did you get what you wanted?"

"Yes," answered Sara.&nbsp; "The wall is gone.&nbsp; Only the love is there."&nbsp; She looked over her shoulder at Joan.&nbsp; "Maybe next time when we feel a wall starting to rise, we can overwhelm it with love and pleasure rather than breaking it down with pain."

"That would be a good thing," said Joan as she started unstrapping Sara from the cross.

"See you two in the morning," said Julie as she and Judy went up the steps toward the hot tub.
"In the morning," answered Joan as she led Sara out through the doorway under the deck to find some fresh snow in which to sit.

"Maybe by morning, we can come out here and melt snow in a different way?" said Sara.&nbsp; "but for now, I just need to cool off the fire in my ass before we go to bed."

"I think we are both strange," said Joan.

"And both wonderful," sighed Sara as she sat in the snow.

Four young college girls on a skiing vacation had to find other things to do when an excess of new snow trapped them in their cabin.&nbsp; This is the eleventh and final episode in this series of the adventures of The Three J&#8217;s and Sara at Mountain Lodge Resort.

This is a VERY mild wrap up for this series of stories.&nbsp; 

This story might make more sense if you have read the previous days of &#8220;Three J&#8217;s and an S Go Skiing,&#8221;

For the most part, the stories in this series are pretty mild.

The Three J&#8217;s and Sara were sitting around the kitchen table of the cabin.&nbsp; Ron and Kevin were on duty, so they had left early to go up to the aid station.&nbsp; Sara, as usual, was busy clearing away dishes and cleaning up the kitchen.&nbsp; And as usual, she was wearing nothing but the velvet collar that Joan had given her.

&#8220;This is our last day here at the cabin,&#8221; said Joan.&nbsp; &#8220;Tomorrow we have to start our long drive back to the real world.&#8221;

&#8220;This is our real world,&#8221; replied Sara.&nbsp; &#8220;It is just that a whole lot has changed in the past ten days that we will have to fit back into the world we left back at college.&#8221;

&#8220;Some things will change, now.&#8221; said Julie.&nbsp; &#8220;Kevin and I are engaged, and that means I am basically out of the heavy duty partying circuit now.&nbsp; No need to keep fishing when you have already caught your limit of prize trout.&#8221;

&#8220;We can party,&#8221; answered Judy, &#8220;but we go together, and come back together and make sure none of us does anything stupid that can screw up what we have found here.&#8221;

&#8220;Sara and I have to figure out how things between us are going to change,&#8221; said Joan.&nbsp; &#8220;I mean, do we move into the same bedroom?&nbsp; Do we tell people at school that we are now a couple?&nbsp; What do we tell our parents?&nbsp; I know some stuff has to change, but some stuff has to stay the same.&nbsp; How do we decide which is which?&#8221;

&#8220;I know one thing that is going to change,&#8221; snickered Judy.&nbsp; &#8220;Sara won&#8217;t have to go tearing ass into the kitchen to put her clothes on every time she hears us moving around in the morning.&#8221;

&#8220;You knew?&#8221; asked Sara.&nbsp; The surprise on her face was very evident.

&#8220;Since about the third day of Freshman year,&#8221; answered Julie.&nbsp; &#8220;But you are not the only woman who likes to do housework in the nude, so we figured we would respect your privacy.&nbsp;&nbsp; That&#8217;s why we always made sure we made some noise so you would hear us before we came out into the living room.&#8221;

&#8220;Everyone except Joan,&#8221; said Judy.&nbsp; &#8220;She would sneak out to the end of the hallway and stand there watching you clean the living room and kitchen.&nbsp; I scared the piss out of her a couple of times by walking up behind her and tapping her on the shoulder.&#8221;

&#8220;You used to watch me?&#8221; Sara asked Joan.

&#8220;I told you I always more than liked you,&#8221; replied Joan.&nbsp; &#8220;I just didn&#8217;t want to admit it to myself or anyone else.&#8221;

&#8220;You didn&#8217;t have to admit it to us.&nbsp; We knew.&nbsp; We always sort of expected you to run out and jump her bones one day, but you never did.&nbsp; I was tempted to shove you out into the living room a couple of times myself when you were standing there in a nightie breathing heavily and rubbing yourself.&#8221;
&#8220;I didn&#8217;t rub myself!&#8221; countered Joan.

Julie just raised her eyebrows and looked at Joan while nodding her head.

&#8220;Oh,&#8221; said Joan.&nbsp; &#8220;I didn&#8217;t realize I was doing that.&#8221;

&#8220;But now the two star-crossed lovers have gotten their stars uncrossed and just have to figure out how to make that work in their lives from this point on,&#8221; said Judy.&nbsp; &#8220;As far as plans for the day, I plan on skiing this morning, and then skiing or hanging around at the lodge this afternoon with Ron.&#8221;

&#8220;That&#8217;s sort of my plan for the day also,&#8221; said Julie.&nbsp; &#8220;Except I plan on being with Kevin this afternoon.&#8221;

Sara cleared the final plate off the table.&nbsp; &#8220;So that plans our final day,&#8221; she said.&nbsp; &#8220;What about our final night?&#8221;

Judy brightened and said, &#8220;Ron is staying here with me tonight.&nbsp; We will be apart for a long time and tonight will have to last us for a while, so I will probably be screwing Ron most of the night.&#8221;

Julie added, &#8220;Same for me.,&#8221; Then she turned bright red and stammered, &#8220;I mean... except not Ron...&nbsp; Kevin...&nbsp; Kevin and I will....&#8221;

Joan said, &#8220;Stop digging Julie.&nbsp; You&#8217;re at the bottom of the hole.&#8221;&nbsp; Everyone laughed and she continued, &#8220;Sara and I won&#8217;t be separated like you guys, so tonight isn&#8217;t quite as frantic for us.&nbsp; But we have a bunch of toys to finish cleaning up and put away.&#8221;

&#8220;So the plan for the whole day is this.&#8221; said Sara.&nbsp; &#8220;We go skiing together this morning, come back here for lunch, go back on the slopes with our fiancee&#8217;s, come back here for supper, and then, after some wine and relaxing in the hot tub, go to bed and screw our brains out until dawn.&#8221;

&#8220;Not exactly,&#8221; said Joan.&nbsp; &#8220;We have a nineteen hour drive ahead of us tomorrow, so at least one of us has to be ready to drive first thing in the morning.&nbsp; Someone has to stop screwing at a reasonable hour and get some sleep.&nbsp; I think that will be Sara and me.&nbsp; You two can sleep in the car for a while and drive later in the day.&#8221;

&#8220;Lets get dressed and hit the slopes.&#8221; said Julie as she got up from the table.&nbsp; &#8220;The day is wasting.&nbsp; We&#8217;ll ski down to the intermediate hill chair lift from here and once we are at the top, we may even convince our no-longer-a-snow-bunny to go over onto the real slopes for a while.&#8221;

&#8220;I think I&#8217;m ready to try that,&#8221; answered Sara as she started downstairs to get her ski clothes.

 = = = = = = = = = 

The Three J&#8217;s and an S spent the morning together and then came back to the cabin to eat lunch.&nbsp; Ron and Kevin were getting off duty at 1:00 so Judy and Julie left early to make the trip down the slope and back up to the aid station.

After they were gone, Joan asked Sara, &#8220;Is your butt as sore as mine?&#8221;

&#8220;Probably not,&#8221; answered Sara.&nbsp; &#8220;It is red and bruised and still swollen, but I had the sense to say 30, not 150.&#8221;

Joan replied, &#8220;Mine is sore enough that I&#8217;m not really in the mood for more skiing.&nbsp; I think that I am going to alternate between applying hot and cold to the bruised areas.&#8221;

&#8220;In other words,&#8221; said Sara, &#8220;you are going to sit in the hot tub until your muscles relax and then go sit in the snow until your butt stops hurting.&#8221;

&#8220;Something like that.&#8221; answered Joan.

&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Sara, &#8220;there are three bottles of wine left in the case and if we get a head start on them, we can finish off one of them before the happy couples get back.&nbsp; We have all afternoon to alternate between hotties and coolies until you aren&#8217;t sure if your ass hurts or not.&#8221;

&#8220;I don&#8217;t know if I&#8217;m in for an afternoon of fast, marathon sex,&#8221; said Joan.

&#8220;Then we will have to go slow and take some rest stops along the way,&#8221; answered Sara as she took off her collar and carefully put it on the table.&nbsp; When Joan looked at her she explained, &#8220;Now I don&#8217;t have to worry about getting that wet if I should have to put my head under water for some reason.&#8221;&nbsp; She then gave Joan one of her lop sided grins and added, &#8220;Maybe we will find out if my breath control is greater than your orgasm control.&#8221;

Sara started for the door.&nbsp; &#8220;I am going to go out and get that bottle of wine.&nbsp; I will meet you in the hot tub.&#8221;

Joan got up from the table, stripped off her clothes, and left them on the counter on the way over to the patio doors that led out onto the deck.

After she was in the hot tub, Sara set two glasses of wine on the edge of the tub and came down into the tub with her.&nbsp; &#8220;How&#8217;s your bottom?&#8221; she asked.

&#8220;Much better,&#8221; answered Joan.&nbsp; &#8220;The warm water feels good on it tonight.&#8221;

&#8220;Does it feel good enough that you can sit up on the edge of the tub?&#8221;

&#8220;Why should I do that?&#8221;

Sara gave her another of her lopsided grins and answered, &#8220;Because I can&#8217;t breathe under water, silly.&nbsp; And if I use a snorkel, I can&#8217;t do this.&#8221;&nbsp; Sara submerged her head under the water and went between Joan&#8217;s legs where she gave her several quick licks and nibbles before having to come up for air.&nbsp; &#8220;Besides,&#8221; she said, somewhat breathlessly, &#8220;you said we should take our time this afternoon and float together in a cloud of pleasure.&nbsp; I figures I would start moving you up toward that cloud.&#8221;

&#8220;That&#8217;s not exactly what I said, but it sounds good to me,&#8221; answered Joan as she used her arms to push herself up out of the water and onto the edge of the tub.&nbsp; &#8220;But when we go out into the snow, I&#8217;ll be the one giving you the pleasure.&#8221;&nbsp; She laughed softly, &#8220;And that way I&#8217;ll be on top.&nbsp; I absolutely don&#8217;t know how you can lay in the snow on your back and still get so turned on.&#8221;

&#8220;You&#8217;ll always be on top for me,&#8221; answered Sara as her kisses worked their way down Joan&#8217;s stomach until her lips began to nibble at her cunt.

 = = = = = =

Later that afternoon, Joan was sleeping on her stomach on a deck chair when Ron and Judy walked up onto the deck.&nbsp; Ron walked over to her and bent down to examine her ass cheeks.&nbsp; &#8220;Pervert,&#8221; giggled Judy and Joan suddenly snapped awake.

She looked up at Ron and he explained rather sheepishly, &#8220;Purely medical.&nbsp; I was looking to see if any of the cuts or bruises were infected.&#8221;

&#8220;I&#8217;ve been alternating heat and ice.&nbsp; And in between, Sara has been rubbing that ointment you gave me into - I mean onto - my butt.&nbsp;&nbsp; It really is feeling much better now.&#8221;

&#8220;It&#8217;s looking much better, too,&#8221; answered Ron.&nbsp; &#8220;And that is from both a medical and horny young man point of view.&#8221;

&#8220;We&#8217;ll take care of the horny part later,&#8221; said Judy.&nbsp; &#8220;Why don&#8217;t we change and relax in the hot tub before supper?&nbsp; Kevin and Julie should be down soon.&nbsp; They were on the phone with her parents up at the lodge when we left.&#8221;

Sara came out onto the deck carrying three robes.&nbsp; She handed a short, white robe to Joan, and another, similar robe to Judy.&nbsp; The larger, flannel robe she handed to Ron.&nbsp; &#8220;You can change inside,&#8221; she said, &#8220;or, if you are comfortable with it, you can just hand me your clothes and I will take them into the bedroom.&#8221;

&#8220;I think I will change in the bedroom,&#8221; said Ron, but Judy began stripping off and handing him her clothes.&nbsp; 

&#8220;Then you can take my clothes inside for me,&#8221; she said with a smile.

As Judy began to step into the hot tub, she turned her head over her shoulder and asked, &#8220;And what is your opinion on MY butt?&#8221;
&#8220;Medically speaking,&#8221; Ron replied, &#8220;healthy looking.&nbsp; Horny young man speaking, perfectly delectable, and enticing.&#8221;

Joan looked up at him from her deck chair and said, &#8220;You two are going to make it.&nbsp; There were about a thousand wrong ways to answer that question, and you picked one of the few right ones.&#8221;

Judy laughed as she settled into the water and then added, &#8220;He&#8217;d better have... he&#8217;d better have.&#8221;

Ron decided he would leave while he was ahead and took Judy&#8217;s clothes with him back into the bedroom to change.

&#8220;Why are men so shy about getting undressed in front of women?&#8221; asked Joan.

Judy laughed and answered, &#8220;I don&#8217;t really know.&nbsp; Maybe it is because of the underwear.&nbsp; Despite anything that anyone says, there is no such thing as sexy men&#8217;s underwear.&#8221;

&#8220;Or maybe it&#8217;s because men know that what women really look at is their butts and that the front side of a man just isn&#8217;t that attractive unless you are already half-way to orgasm.&#8221; suggested Judy.

&#8220;So you are saying that it takes a cute butt to get you wet before a man&#8217;s junk looks sexy to you?&#8221; asked Sara.&nbsp; &#8220;No wonder men are so confused.&nbsp; According to that, they would have to approach a woman backwards in order to make an impression.&#8221;

&#8220;Or play football in those really tight pants,&#8221; added Judy.&nbsp; When Joan looked up at her, she added, &#8220;You don&#8217;t think I watch the those games for the cheerleaders, do you?&#8221;

&#8220;I do,&#8221; answered Sara, &#8220;but that&#8217;s probably why I am sleeping with Joan rather than Ron or Kevin.&#8221;

&#8220;Speaking of Kevin,&#8221; said Judy.&nbsp; &#8220;Julie has a request.&nbsp; She said Kevin has loosened up quite a bit, but please, no sex in front of Kevin.&nbsp; &#8216;Take it to your room when it gets to that point&#8217; is the way she said it.&#8221;

&#8220;I don&#8217;t think we have to worry,&#8221; said Joan.&nbsp; &#8220;I think Julie will have Kevin back in the bedroom before Sara has the supper dishes done and put away.&#8221;

&#8220;Speaking of supper,&#8221; said Sara, &#8220;I can hear Kevin&#8217;s snowmobile now.&nbsp; I will get things ready to go in about twenty minutes.&#8221;

 = = = = = 

Following supper, events unfolded pretty much as Joan had predicted.&nbsp; Everyone recessed to the deck / hot tub for some wine and conversation, but before everyone had completed their first glass of wine, Julie was hinting strongly that it was time for them to go back to the bedroom.
After they left, Ron said, &#8220;Ok, why is everyone trying not to laugh?&#8221;

&#8220;Because Julie is so sweet and straight and predictable,&#8221; answered Judy.&nbsp; &#8220;She is going to make a great lab rat somewhere after she gets her doctorate in chemistry or physics or whatever.&#8221;

&#8220;And you are a business major who wants to teach the future corporate giants of the world,&#8221; said Ron.&nbsp; &#8220;Joan, what is your major?&#8221;

&#8220;English literature and composition,&#8221; answered Joan.&nbsp; &#8220;I am going to be writer who doesn&#8217;t starve because I will be teaching others how to go out and starve trying to live off their writing.&#8221;

&#8220;I am stopping at an undergraduate degree and am going to teach grade school,&#8221; said Sara.&nbsp; &#8220;I really do like little kids.&nbsp; There is something about their openness and honesty.&#8221;

&#8220;It helps that you are going to be a little kid forever yourself,&#8221; said Judy.&nbsp; She emptied the wine bottle, refilling her wine glass and Kevin&#8217;s, and said, &#8220;So isn&#8217;t it time for you kids to get off to bed?&#8221;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Joan and Sara looked over to her, she added, &#8220;You&#8217;ve had the hot tub to yourself all afternoon.&nbsp; Now it&#8217;s our turn.&#8221;

&#8220;OK,&#8221; said Joan laughing.&nbsp; &#8220;I need to drive first tomorrow anyway.&#8221;

&#8220;I have three empty wine bottles to put back in the case first.&nbsp;&nbsp; And then I have to figure out what to do with the cases,&#8221; said Sara.

Ron replied, &#8220;Leave them with your trash bags.&nbsp; They will get taken for recycling.&nbsp; Did you girls really go through 24 bottles of wine in 9 days?&#8221; 

&#8220;We had help,&#8221; answered Judy.

&#8220;But the help brought 48 bottles of beer that also got finished off.&#8221; insisted Ron.

By that time, Sara was making her last trip into the snow to return empties.&nbsp; When she came back she was carrying both cases of empty bottles.&nbsp; &#8220;I&#8217;ll leave these here on the deck and set them out in the morning before we leave.&nbsp; Right now, Joan and I have to finish putting away toys.&nbsp; We got most of it done this afternoon, but there are still a few things left.&#8221;

When Sara got downstairs, the lights were on, but Joan was already in bed.&nbsp; All of the Jurgensen&#8217;s toys were washed, sanitized and locked away in the drawer.&nbsp; Sandy and Mandy&#8217;s Saint Andrews Cross had been disassembled and returned to its place under the closets along with the parts and clamps for the pillory.&nbsp; The specially built bench that could be a Sybian horse stand or a pillory was back under the deck alongside the hot tub.&nbsp; But the door to Joan&#8217;s aunts&#8217; closet still leaned against the wall alongside the opening.&nbsp; And in the other bedroom, sitting on its pad next to Joan&#8217;s bed, was the Sybian.&nbsp; The double penetrator attachment was installed on the top of the saddle.&nbsp; The unit was plugged in and the remote was lying on the floor next to it.

As Sara came into the room, Joan looked up sleepily.&nbsp; &#8220;I really do need to get some sleep tonight.&nbsp; I thought you might want to float off into pure pleasure by yourself for a while.&#8221;

&#8220;Won&#8217;t it keep you awake?&#8221; asked Sara.

&#8220;Not unless you start screaming,&#8221; answered Joan.

Sara kissed Joan goodnight and said, &#8220;I will save the screams to wake you up in the morning.&#8221;&nbsp; Then she centered herself over the Sybian, knelt down, and settled back onto the dual dildos.

&#8220;It&#8217;s already set to what you had it the other day,&#8221; said Joan.

Sara turned the switches and in a little while, her head was back and she was humming along with the Sybian.

&#8220;If we recorded that,&#8221; said Joan sleepily from the bed, &#8220;we could call it The Sounds of Contentment.&nbsp; It is so peaceful sounding....&nbsp; so peaceful...&nbsp; so peaceful.......&#8221;&nbsp; Her voiced trailed off into sleep.

Sara looked at Joan sleeping nearby and closed her eyes.&nbsp; As she drifted into her special place she thought about the previous days of their vacation.&nbsp; &#8220;What I have learned in the past ten days,&#8221; she thought to herself, &#8220;besides the fact that Joan loves me as much as I love her, is that pure pain is terrible, and pain mixed with pleasure can be really nice, but pure pleasure is wonderful.&#8221;&nbsp; Soon Sara was swaying slightly on the Sybian saddle as she gave herself over to the pure pleasure that she was feeling.

&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she said softly to herself as she rocked slowly back and forward, &#8220;this has truly been a wonderful winter vacation.&#8221;
