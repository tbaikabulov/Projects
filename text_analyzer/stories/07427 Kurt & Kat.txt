Synopsis: 






 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Kurt lifted the coffee to his lips; let the steam tickle the insides of his nose.&nbsp; Nothing felt better in the winter cold than coffee shop steam.&nbsp; He darted his tongue into the whip cream top experimentally and came away satisfied.&nbsp; A tiny smile crept across his lips.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�You&#8217;re like a big kid,� his coffee companion observed.&nbsp; She was tall, but looked shorter slouched in the coffee shop comfy chair.&nbsp; Her chestnut hair fell in bouncy waves around her head and shoulders like a frisky halo.&nbsp; She was dressed for the weather in a tight turtle neck sweater that matched her hair in colour and hugged her robust breasts alluringly.&nbsp; Tight jeans and running shoes&#8212;that she always wore in winter regardless.&nbsp; She never wore a jacket.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Something you&#8217;ve noted before,� Kurt shot back.&nbsp; Secretly he was satisfied though.&nbsp; No one else noticed his surreptitious frog-like whip cream grab except her.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�It never changes,� she said, smiling broadly.&nbsp; �But then sometimes I think you maybe just do it for me.&nbsp; If you were actually on a date with some woman would you do that?� her eyes twinkled like the mini Christmas lights strung up around the windows of the coffee shop.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�You&#8217;re probably right,� Kurt agreed, deciding it was safe to commit some of the scalding liquid to his mouth at last.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�So why with me then?� she asked.&nbsp; Her tone implied it was a rhetorical question; she already knew the answer.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Silly Kat, you know why.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Which of your other friends would put up with that crap?� Kat asked.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�All of them.&nbsp; Otherwise they wouldn&#8217;t be my friends,� Kurt replied wittily, smiling when he saw he&#8217;d outmaneuvered his friend.&nbsp; Kat tipped her drink towards him in a toast.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Touch�.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Yeah well��
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�So who are you chasing these days?� Kat asked.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I don&#8217;t know; nobody I guess.&nbsp; It&#8217;s gotten kind of boring Kat, seriously.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�What has?&nbsp; The chase?&nbsp; The conquest?&nbsp; The having and the holding or just the fucking?� Kat asked.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Everything.&nbsp; I&#8217;ve decided to turn over a new leaf; look for something more and all that,� Kurt said.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Uh-huh.&nbsp; How long is that going to last this time?�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Hey long enough!� he said, threatening her with a mocking pointer finger.&nbsp; �I&#8217;m not such a bad guy once you get to know me.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Yeah but look how long it took me hanging around to figure that out.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Were we good together?�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�You mean that two weeks we dated?&nbsp; I don&#8217;t know Kurt, were we?� she winked, �why so serious all of a sudden?�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Not serious, just&#8212;uh&#8212;retrospective I guess.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Yuh huh.&nbsp; We didn&#8217;t work Kurt it&#8217;s true, but look at our friendship now; stuff of legend.&nbsp; So everything works out for the best.&nbsp; Maybe you&#8217;re just in a rut,� Kat offered.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Maybe,� Kurt agreed.&nbsp; Kat&#8217;s cell phone went off twice to remind her of an appointment.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Oh I forgot to tell you,� she said, reaching down to shut it off, �I have to leave early today.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�What?� Kurt asked, stunned and a little hurt.&nbsp; Her job had never interfered with their coffee &#8216;dates&#8217; before.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Yeah sorry.&nbsp; It was kind of a last minute thing; I didn&#8217;t think you&#8217;d mind.�&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Kurt didn&#8217;t say anything, just sipped his coffee moodily.&nbsp; Kat reached out across the little coffee table and touched a hand to his knee.&nbsp; �You&#8217;re not upset are you?�&nbsp; He shook his head.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�You&#8217;re sure?&nbsp; I don&#8217;t have to go yet, I mean I&#8217;ve got ten minutes.&nbsp; It&#8217;s not like I&#8217;m abandoning you or anything,� Kat defended herself.&nbsp; Kurt was the only person she ever felt the need to do so with.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He fixed her with a steady gaze over the remains of his whip cream.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Why do you do that job?� he asked.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Huh?� 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�You know, the&#8212;uh&#8212;the dominatrix thing.&nbsp; Why do you do that?� he asked.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Here&#8217;s a conversation we haven&#8217;t had in a while,� Kat remarked.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I&#8217;m just curious.&nbsp; I mean, does it still make you happy?&nbsp; Or is it all about the money now?�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Kat&#8217;s eyes grew frosty and she raised an eyebrow.&nbsp; Anyone else would have been petrified; her own sisters knew the look they feared.&nbsp; Kurt however had known her too long and vice versa.&nbsp; He&#8217;d become impervious to her glare, which meant she couldn&#8217;t stay mad at him long.&nbsp; She knew by the time she left the coffee shop her anger at Kurt&#8217;s sting would have passed and they&#8217;d be back to normal.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�You know how good the money is.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t work so much and I have my own house and car and buy whatever I want&#8212;when I want.&nbsp; I make as much as you do in that design art thing you call a job.&nbsp; Tell me, does that make you happy still?�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Not really,� Kurt answered.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Well you know what,� she leaned forward, �you know it&#8217;s what I enjoy Kurt.&nbsp; It&#8217;s what I need.&nbsp; And the money is good.�&nbsp; She stood up to go and dropped her coffee cup into a nearby garbage can.&nbsp; �And I do enjoy it.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The phone tinkled three times and he was just about to hang up when she came on the line.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�It&#8217;s me.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Thought you might ring up.&nbsp; What&#8217;s up?�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Look Kat, I&#8217;m sorry about that thing about being a dominatrix at the shop today.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Yeah what was that about?� Kat asked, squeezing Kurt a little over the phone.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Nothing much; I&#8217;m just not used to sharing you I guess.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Kat laughed sharply.&nbsp; �Don&#8217;t worry Kurty.&nbsp; Besides, you&#8217;re not my boyfriend.&nbsp; Even if you were you wouldn&#8217;t get a say in how I run my life&#8212;�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I know, it&#8217;s just we&#8217;ve been friends so long��
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Kurt honey, don&#8217;t worry.&nbsp; Some little slut who dumps money at my feet to beat the shit out of him isn&#8217;t going to replace you in my heart,� he could hear her eyes twinkling mischievously over the phone.&nbsp; Kurt had become convinced that they made a small sound when they did.&nbsp; �Besides, today was a once in a lifetime thing.&nbsp; It won&#8217;t happen again so don&#8217;t worry.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I know.&nbsp; It&#8217;s fine.&nbsp; So did you get up to anything fun at least today?� Kurt asked, jumping back onto the small talk tract.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Fun?&nbsp; Like ha-ha fun or fun fun?�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Well fun fun obviously.&nbsp; Geez.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Well I did have this little nineteen year old show up today.&nbsp; That&#8217;s who I met when I left the shop��
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Shit, Kurt realized.&nbsp; She had been going to an appointment.&nbsp; All she&#8217;d been up to all day was working and he didn&#8217;t really want to hear about that.&nbsp; He&#8217;d long ago learned a little trick.&nbsp; Whenever Kat went into detail he sort of tuned her out.&nbsp; When she&#8217;d first started as a dominatrix he&#8217;d been supportive and listened to her wild stories and from time to time&#8212;especially on the phone&#8212;he&#8217;d had to work hard to keep a raging hard on contained.&nbsp; To avoid the embarrassment he tended to disconnect from the conversation when it steered into Kat&#8217;s work.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Kat was continuing on the other end of the line.&nbsp; ��rode him around the room like a horse with a bit in his mouth.&nbsp; But now I need new spurs&#8212;�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Wait, you have spurs?� Kurt blurted out.&nbsp; And suddenly he was back in the conversation.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Yeah, of course.&nbsp; Today though I got a little too excited I guess.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�What happened?�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I rammed them into this kid&#8217;s thighs and got them bloody.&nbsp; Real bloody,� Kat explained.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Just use them again,� Kurt said.&nbsp; He could see her already shaking her head, her wavy hair dancing back and forth across her face.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�No can do.&nbsp; Have to replace them.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Right right.&nbsp; Safety and all that,� Kurt mumbled.&nbsp; Something was stirring in his groin.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�So, uh, why don&#8217;t you just save them to use on that guy again?&nbsp; It&#8217;s his blood isn&#8217;t it?� Kurt asked, working desperately now to disconnect again.&nbsp; He wanted to move the conversation onto something else but his tongue wasn&#8217;t cooperating.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Kat laughed again.&nbsp; �I don&#8217;t think he&#8217;ll be back again,� she admitted.&nbsp; �He said I scared him and it was maybe a little more intense than he&#8217;d originally thought.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�God, what do you do to these guys?� Kurt asked.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I make all their fantasies come true Kurty.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Well it doesn&#8217;t sound like getting spurred to death is this today guy&#8217;s fantasy.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Again Kurt could picture Kat shaking her head before she even spoke.&nbsp; �Oh it&#8217;s in there somewhere.&nbsp; He&#8217;s just not ready for it to take over his life yet.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Yeah, speaking of that how&#8217;s that going?
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�What?&nbsp; My Big Search?� Kat asked.&nbsp; Kurt grunted in agreement that that was what he&#8217;d meant.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Not going is more like it,� Kat explained, �I may give these guys all the fantasies they&#8217;re after but they sure as hell don&#8217;t bring me mine.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�That sucks.&nbsp; What are you going to do about it?� Kurt asked.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Don&#8217;t know.&nbsp; I&#8217;ll figure out something though.&nbsp; Don&#8217;t I always?&nbsp; Oh hey, there&#8217;s a movie I want to see this weekend, want to go?� Kat asked.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Okay, let&#8217;s do it.�&nbsp; He didn&#8217;t ask what the movie was or even when.&nbsp; He&#8217;d be there.&nbsp; �Hey, uh, Kat, do you want to uh�you know?&nbsp; After the show maybe.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There was a brief silence on the other end of the phone.&nbsp; Kurt knew she was contemplating.&nbsp; �I don&#8217;t think so Kurty.&nbsp; I mean, it got weird there for a bit last time.&nbsp; It&#8217;s not like there&#8217;s a short line of girls waiting to fuck with you.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Yeah, yeah true,� Kurt admitted.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;They finished up and Kurt hung up.&nbsp; Something was bubbling through his head and his gut but he couldn&#8217;t quite place it.&nbsp; He liked Kat and knew she liked him.&nbsp; They&#8217;d been friends for years and years in any direction.&nbsp; Neither could exactly remember where they&#8217;d first met.&nbsp; They&#8217;d tried dating once and moved on from that into the solid foundation of friendship they had now.&nbsp; With the occasional lustful interlude things worked well.&nbsp; Friends with benefits and all that.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;So what was bothering him?&nbsp; He had no idea.&nbsp; Sleep on it, Kurt thought, and after take-out and a movie alone he did.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Friday morning rolled around expectedly but unbidden.&nbsp; Kurt found himself staring at the ceiling long before his alarm even had the chance to shriek once.&nbsp; It had come to him sometime in the night and jolted him awake.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He was jealous.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Stone jealous of all the little shits and fat jerk-offs who got to spend time&#8212;sexy time with Kat.&nbsp; It was true he wasn&#8217;t her boyfriend and he didn&#8217;t want that; he didn&#8217;t think.&nbsp; It was something else he wanted.&nbsp; He wanted to be with her but not with-with her, if that made any sense.&nbsp; God it was maddening. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He lumbered to the bathroom and shaved and scrubbed himself clean, waiting for the usual jolt of wake-up that finally got him ticking for a work day.&nbsp; At least it was the weekend tomorrow and Kat wanted to go to some movie so that was all right.&nbsp; He was looking forward to that.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He knew what some of it was though, Kurt thought, staring himself down in the over-sink mirror.&nbsp; Whenever he and Kat had had too much to drink or went out of their way to find the other for a tryst it was always what she called &#8216;vanilla&#8217;.&nbsp; Kurt always thought of pudding for some reason whenever she said it.&nbsp; Every time even though he rolled away feeling like a million bucks he knew he&#8217;d barely scratched the surface of what it took to satisfy his friend.&nbsp; One time she hadn&#8217;t even orgasmed even though she claimed she had.&nbsp; There was one giant block of her life that he seemed all but shut out of.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The thoughts were still bopping around inside his brain through rush-hour traffic and into work.&nbsp; They felt like bingo balls all rolling about pointlessly inside his skull.&nbsp; Just before lunch he had the most overwhelming urge to masturbate and found himself whacking off in the third floor washroom.&nbsp; He shot his load straight across the chasm between the toilet and the stall door where it landed solidly against the metal.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Holy fuck, what was that about? He wondered absently, wiping the door down with a piece of toilet paper.&nbsp; Range was never one of his strong suits.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As the afternoon wore on and people slowly made a break for the exits as early as they could, Kurt found himself swinging back and forth on his chair staring stupidly at his computer monitor.&nbsp; A co-worker stuck his head in.&nbsp; �Something on your mind buddy?� he asked.&nbsp; Kurt shook his head.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Time for bed I think,� he lied.&nbsp; Satisfied, his well-wisher left.&nbsp; But sleeping was the last thing Kurt felt like doing.&nbsp; Something inside of him was on fire.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When the office had all but cleared out and sounds echoed like the inside of a tomb, Kurt found his fingers digging for his cell phone.&nbsp; There were only two speed dial entries.&nbsp; His parents; an obvious duty choice.&nbsp; And Kat.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Yes?� she whispered into the phone, half seductively.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�It&#8217;s me you big goof,� he said.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I know.&nbsp; What do you want?&nbsp; I&#8217;m uh, kind of in the middle of something.&nbsp; Actually, can I call you back?� Kat asked.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Kurt nodded his head but his lips surprised him.&nbsp; �Actually it&#8217;s kind of important.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Okay, just let me slip outside.�&nbsp; There was some rustling and noise making on her end and then Kat came back on the line.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Okay, so what&#8217;s so important that it couldn&#8217;t wait?�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I&#8217;ve been thinking about your problem,� Kurt said.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I wasn&#8217;t aware I had one,� she joked.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Your-uh-your Big Search problem,� Kurt added.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�No Kurt, no, if this is some set up with a weirdo buddy of yours the answer&#8217;s no.&nbsp; Besides, I&#8217;m too picky for just anybody as you well know.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Yeah I know that Kat.&nbsp; I&#8217;m not trying to set you up with anybody, so don&#8217;t worry,� Kurt assured her.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Then what&#8217;s up?� Kat was starting to sound exasperated.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�How about me?� blurted through his lips.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Say what?�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Me Kat.&nbsp; Me.&nbsp; How about me?�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Kurty, what the fuck are you talking about?� Kat demanded.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I know you inside and out.&nbsp; I&#8217;d be perfect.&nbsp; I uh�I want to be, uh, I want to be near you Kat.&nbsp; So I was thinking, wouldn&#8217;t I be perfect?� Kurt blundered on.&nbsp; It occurred to him that he should have thought out what he&#8217;d planned to say before he&#8217;d called her up.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Kurt, are you saying what I think you&#8217;re saying?� Kat wondered.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Absolutely.&nbsp; I&#8217;ve thought about it.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�You don&#8217;t have any idea&#8212;�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Then teach me!� Kurt almost shouted.&nbsp; He poked his head outside his office to see if any stragglers had overheard.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I uh, I need to think about this Kurt.&nbsp; It&#8217;s all so sudden I mean,� Kat mumbled.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Okay, yeah, of course.&nbsp; Sorry, I just wanted to phone you and tell you I mean.&nbsp; We&#8217;ll talk about it huh, figure something out?�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Yeah sure Kurt�� Kat trailed off.&nbsp; Kurt could sense she was still brewing on the other end with things unsaid.&nbsp; He waited silently, barely breathing.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Actually Kurty, you know what, fuck it!&nbsp; Seriously, fuck it!&nbsp; Come over tonight, eight o&#8217;clock.&nbsp; Don&#8217;t be late.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Um, okay.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I&#8217;ll see you at eight okay.&nbsp; Right now I have to go back in and spit on this guy or he&#8217;ll want his money back,� Kat said.&nbsp; He could picture her winking on the end of the line.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Kurt drove around aimlessly for a few hours, looking at things he&#8217;d seen before and stopping in front of things he didn&#8217;t really want to see but which suddenly helped him pass the time.&nbsp; Eight o&#8217;clock ticked closer so excruciatingly slowly he suspected he would keel over and die of a ripe old age before it even got close.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He slowly narrowed his winding car circles and at seven thirty exactly drove straight for Kat&#8217;s house, pulling up with over fifteen minutes to spare.&nbsp; He could sit out here drumming his hands against the steering wheel or he could go in.&nbsp; She knew he was there anyway.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;With his first two knuckles, Kurt tapped out the shared secret knock they used before just walking into each others houses.&nbsp; The times one of them found the other lounging on their furniture or in their fridge unannounced were too many to count.&nbsp; Pushing the handle though Kurt found the door surprisingly locked.&nbsp; What the hell?
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Footfalls echoed on the other side of the door.&nbsp; She was wearing heels.&nbsp; He would congratulate himself when he was proven right.&nbsp; But then, Kat never wore shoes in the house�ever.&nbsp; It was socks and the occasional bare foot day.&nbsp; She always made him take his off whenever he wandered over.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The lock tumbled and the door swung open.&nbsp; Kat stood in front of him, standing on the raised step out of the little square of tiled entry way she towered over Kurt completely. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It wasn&#8217;t just the step.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She had a good six inches on her in heel alone.&nbsp; Slick fitting shiny leather boots crawled their way up from the impressive heels to end just over mid-thigh.&nbsp; A stretchy rubber looking thong covered just enough of her privates to be indecent.&nbsp; Her breasts were bare and hung over what looked to Kurt like some sort of leather &#8216;under-bra&#8217; that cupped the edges of her tits and came to a sharp looking &#8216;V&#8217; pointing the way towards her navel where a glittering navel stud he&#8217;d never seen before shone back at him.&nbsp; Her flowing chestnut hair was pulled up in a severe pony tail that bounced of its own accord just behind her head.&nbsp; Leather gloves stretched right up to her armpits, each one had a zipper running from the wrist to the end.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Nice uh, nice bra Kat,� Kurt mumbled stupidly.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Yeah you like it?� she asked, almost sarcastically.&nbsp; �So close the door.�&nbsp; He did and mechanically kicked off his own shoes.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Get your clothes off,� Kat whispered, a hard edge creeping into her voice, �now.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Kurt looked dumbfounded.&nbsp; He started glancing around, for what, he didn&#8217;t know.&nbsp; Viper-like, Kat&#8217;s hand flew out and found purchase in Kurt&#8217;s hair.&nbsp; With a practiced motion she pulled just enough to force him to his knees.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Now Kurt, I won&#8217;t ask again.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Newly refocused, he all but blew out of his clothes, leaving them in a loose pile in the entry-way.&nbsp; Kat turned and walked confidently into the living room.&nbsp; Instinctively Kurt got up and followed her.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;By the coffee table they&#8217;d shared, well, coffee over countless times before, Kat suddenly turned to stare at him.&nbsp; �Why. The. Fuck. Are. You. Standing?� she spit each word like a curse.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Kurt motioned to the door.&nbsp; �Well I was uh, over there, and uh, you well, you walked in here, so I thought I&#8217;d follow.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t know.&nbsp; I mean&#8212;�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Knees,� Kat whispered.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Feeling like an idiot Kurt dropped to his knees on the rug.&nbsp; �Uh, now what?� he asked stupidly.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Kat stared down coolly at him and then broke into a smile.&nbsp; �Kurty, are you sure about this?&nbsp; I mean, this is great, thanks, but are you really sure?�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Yup.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The smile on her lips changed slightly, inched a degree or two closer to cruel but he barely noticed.&nbsp; �Then hang on,� she instructed.&nbsp; �Don&#8217;t move, don&#8217;t blink; don&#8217;t even breathe until I get back.&nbsp; Understood?�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Uh-huh.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�We&#8217;ll have to work on that,� Kat mumbled, almost to herself.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She slunk off down the hall and he heard her rustling in her bedroom.&nbsp; Kurt screwed his eyes closed until they hurt; working at convincing himself he wasn&#8217;t in some weird lucid dream.&nbsp; Kat was back before he knew it.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Towering above him (he came to her crotch on his knees), Kat smiled down at him.&nbsp; She had a piece of what looked like heavy leather with buckles on one end spread in her hands.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Do you see this Kurt?�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Nope, I have no idea what you&#8217;re talking about!� Kurt smirked, pulling out the usual sarcastic banter they tossed back and forth.&nbsp; He waited for Kat&#8217;s expected witty reply.&nbsp; Instead her hand flew out, just as fast as it had to grab his hair, and connected solidly with his cheek.&nbsp; He never saw it coming; the blow literally knocked him back onto his ass.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�What the fuck!� he hissed, testing with his tongue for blood.&nbsp; There was a small cut where his lip had grazed a tooth.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�None of that Kurt.&nbsp; If I ask you a question I want an answer; an honest answer and I want it immediately.&nbsp; Understood?�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Holy God, yes, okay.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Now get back up on your knees.&nbsp; Let&#8217;s try this again,� Kat ordered.&nbsp; Kurt nodded dumbly and climbed back up into his kneeling position.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Now, do you see this thing?� Kat asked again.&nbsp; Kurt nodded that he did.&nbsp; She raised her hand slightly and felt a swift tingle between her legs when he instinctively cowered backward.&nbsp; �I asked Kurt, do you see this thing?�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Yes,� Kurt whispered.&nbsp; Suddenly he was having trouble looking his long time friend in the eye.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�This is a symbol Kurt.&nbsp; It&#8217;s a collar, like a dog&#8217;s collar, for slaves.&nbsp; It&#8217;s a slave&#8217;s collar.&nbsp; If I put it on you it marks an agreement between us understand.&nbsp; When the collar is on you belong to me&#8212;I would say like a dog but you know how much I love and respect dogs&#8212;so let&#8217;s say like a vibrator okay.&nbsp; You belong to me just like the vibrator in my dresser drawer&#8212;�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�That big one you got at the sex party?�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Does it matter?� Kat snapped.&nbsp; �Don&#8217;t interrupt.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She continued.&nbsp; �If this collar goes around your neck it takes away all your rights Kurty.&nbsp; Everything.&nbsp; You do what I tell you, you act how I tell you; you talk when I allow it and piss when I want you to.&nbsp; It means I own you completely and I&#8217;ll use you any fucking way I want.&nbsp; If I want to sit on your face and have you eat me out until you pass out that&#8217;s the way it is.&nbsp; Understood?�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As if in answer Kurt&#8217;s erection erupted and sprung full out in front of him.&nbsp; Kat touched the toe of a boot to it experimentally, a small smile on her face.&nbsp; �Well it looks like even after all this time there are things I don&#8217;t know about you.&nbsp; Maybe you don&#8217;t even know them about yourself huh?�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Suddenly Kat leaned down and grasped Kurt&#8217;s shoulder rigidly.&nbsp; She stared him in the eye; hers were watering.&nbsp; �Kurty, you know this will change our friendship right?&nbsp; Nothing will be the same again.&nbsp; The next time we sit around here drinking coffee you might be naked bringing it to me on a tray tied to your balls.�&nbsp; She smiled at the mental picture she&#8217;d obviously conjured up.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Kurt blinked heavily and nodded.&nbsp; �I know.&nbsp; It&#8217;s okay Kat.&nbsp; It&#8217;s really okay.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She flung her arms around him in a tight embrace.&nbsp; Kurt felt the slide of her gloves over his skin and tingled.&nbsp; His erection strained even harder to get up and walk away on its own.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Thank you�� Kat whispered breathlessly into his ear.&nbsp; �Kurty, thank you.�&nbsp; She planted a short kiss near the ear.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She stood up and picked up and fingered the collar.&nbsp; �Put your chin up,� she ordered.&nbsp; He complied.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;With a swift practiced motion Kat wrapped the collar around Kurt&#8217;s throat and slid the buckles into place.&nbsp; Kurt swallowed experimentally.&nbsp; Stepping back, Kat surveyed her handiwork. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I&#8217;ll call you many things but mostly &#8216;slave&#8217;.&nbsp; You&#8217;ll speak only when spoken to and address me&#8212;every time&#8212;as Mistress Kat.&nbsp; If you forget, you&#8217;ll suffer for it.&nbsp; Simple as that.&nbsp; Understood�slave?�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Kurt nodded and then remembered himself.&nbsp; �Yes�Mistress Kat.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�That collar stays on all weekend understood.&nbsp; Sunday night I&#8217;ll take it off.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Okay Mistress Kat.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Kat surveyed the room.&nbsp; �When did I get this rug installed?� she asked oddly.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Kurt had to think about it.&nbsp; �Last year.&nbsp; We went shopping for it that one weekend.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Suddenly the heel of Kat&#8217;s boot was digging deep into his soft side just below Kurt&#8217;s ribs.&nbsp; �Forget something?� she asked.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�We went shopping for it Mistress Kat!� Kurt shouted.&nbsp; Satisfied, Kat disengaged her heel.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Very good.&nbsp; So obviously then it&#8217;s still relatively new and I don&#8217;t want to ruin it.&nbsp; Slave, where in this room isn&#8217;t there carpet?� Kat asked.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�We carpeted the whole thing�Mistress Kat.&nbsp; Just the entry way and the kitchen have tile,� Kurt recalled.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Good slave,� Kat whispered.&nbsp; �I want you to go lay on your back with your head hanging over the step over the entry tile.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Kurt nodded and stood up.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Slave,� Kat whispered.&nbsp; The edge was in her voice all the time now.&nbsp; �I know I didn&#8217;t mention it so you get a free pass this time.&nbsp; Always, always, always on your knees.&nbsp; If you get off your knees I swear to God I&#8217;ll hobble you.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�So crawl then?� Kurt double checked.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Everywhere.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Yes Mistress Kat.�&nbsp; Kurt crawled as speedily as he could to the entry way and flipped over onto his back, hanging his head over the tile.&nbsp; The riser caught him right in the neck and hurt like a bitch.&nbsp; Blood rushed to his head.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Kat walked calmly over to his prone body and smiled.&nbsp; �Very good slave.&nbsp; Very very good.&nbsp; Open your mouth.�&nbsp; Kurt complied immediately.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Kat stepped over him, planting her feet firmly on either side of his hanging head.&nbsp; With a finger she pulled aside the thin material of her thong exposing the lips of her pussy.&nbsp; Without warning a warm stream of yellow urine started, stopped, then started again, this time running full towards Kurt&#8217;s open mouth.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Kat&#8217;s piss bounced off Kurt&#8217;s face, forcing him to close his eyes and move his mouth, desperately trying to catch the stream.&nbsp; It ran over his cheeks and dripped onto the tile under his head.&nbsp; Kat peed steadily for a few seconds and then the stream tapered off.&nbsp; When she was sure she&#8217;d finished she reached down and picking up the shirt Kurt had left in the entry used it to wipe her largest lips.&nbsp; Satisfied she tossed the shirt back in the pile of his clothes and grinned down at him.&nbsp; His eyes were still clamped tightly closed.&nbsp; Shining globules of her piss rested like dew in his eye lashes.&nbsp; Perfect, she thought.&nbsp; Beautiful and perfect.&nbsp; Carefully she readjusted her PVC thong.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Consider yourself marked territory slave,� she smiled.&nbsp; Kurt&#8217;s eyes were still closed.&nbsp; �You missed some by the way so you&#8217;re going to clean it up, all of it, with your tongue.&nbsp; When you&#8217;re finished I&#8217;ll be waiting for you in the TV room.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Kurt felt her step away and retreat.&nbsp; Slowly he turned his head and carefully rubbed his eyes, trying to whisk away Kat&#8217;s urine.&nbsp; He got up on his knees to stare at the small puddle and the piss running in the grouting between the tiles.&nbsp; Fuck, he thought.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In all the years he&#8217;d known her Kurt never would have believed Kat was capable of pissing on her best friend and then ordering him to lick it up.&nbsp; What had he gotten himself into?
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;His mouth tasted of piss.&nbsp; Kurt was sure he had some up his nose too.&nbsp; It was everywhere he imagined as he crawled on his knees down the short stairs to Kat&#8217;s TV room.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Is your tongue tired slave?� she asked bitchily from where she sat comfortably on the couch.&nbsp; His usual spot when they watched a movie or something was the recliner on her right.&nbsp; Almost by instinct he started heading towards it and then stopped in the middle of the floor.&nbsp; What was he supposed to do now?&nbsp; Where was he supposed to go?
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Kat slowly got up from the couch and walked over to him, her boots making soft impressions in the rug.&nbsp; Almost casually she bent down by Kurt&#8217;s side and then just as suddenly gripped him by the hair and pulled his head straight back.&nbsp; With her other hand she forced two fingers into his mouth and pried his jaw open.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Looks like your tongue&#8217;s still there, so I wonder what the problem is?�&nbsp; Kat reached into his mouth and caught his tongue between two fingers and her thumb.&nbsp; Savagely she pulled it out past his teeth as if examining it in some experiment.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Aaim thory Istress Clat,� Kurt tried to shout.&nbsp; None too gently Kat released his tongue back into his mouth.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�What was that?� she asked.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I&#8217;m sorry Mistress Kat.&nbsp; I&#8217;m sorry I didn&#8217;t answer.&nbsp; Yes, my tongue&#8217;s tired�Mistress Kat,� Kurt blabbered.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Kat smiled sweetly into his eyes.&nbsp; �Then I guess when you&#8217;re done here it&#8217;ll be exhausted.�&nbsp; She stood up and sat back on the couch.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Come here slave,� she ordered.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Obediently, Kurt crawled towards her, bringing himself up short just at the inside of her ankles.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�You&#8217;re about to get a lesson in the place of a slave,� Kat started, �As a slave, you&#8217;re basically a living breathing fuck toy for me to play with slave.&nbsp; That&#8217;s why when I start to hurt you even if you beg it doesn&#8217;t have any effect.&nbsp; Your whole reason for being is to please me however I want.&nbsp; That&#8217;s it.&nbsp; Do you need to work?&nbsp; Do you need to eat?&nbsp; Do you need to pee?&nbsp; Do you need to sleep?&nbsp; Doesn&#8217;t matter.&nbsp; You&#8217;re nothing now slave.&nbsp; I could hang you to death right here just for the sake of an orgasm and afterwards I wouldn&#8217;t feel anything.&nbsp; Of course it&#8217;d be a bitch to get rid of the body and I would probably feel bad because of who you were to me, but I could do it if I wanted and you would get up on the stool and thank me for snuffing you out like a light bulb.&nbsp; Are you starting to understand?�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Yes Mistress Kat,� Kurt whispered.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Then you&#8217;ll put that tongue to more use and clean my boots.&nbsp; Think of it as a lesson: even dogs don&#8217;t clean their owner&#8217;s boots,� Kat said, gesturing towards Kurt&#8217;s mouth with the toe of her boot.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Nodding his understanding he darted his tongue out experimentally, touching it to the smooth leather of her stiletto.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�You&#8217;re going to hafta do better than that slave,� she nudged his lips playfully with her foot.&nbsp; Kurt plunged into his work, working his tongue in long cat strokes up and down the length of Kat&#8217;s boot, proud of the shine he was producing.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�The heel,� his Mistress instructed.&nbsp; Nodding his understanding Kurt moved his mouth to the stiletto heel, taking it into his mouth like a slender cock.&nbsp; How did one go about sucking cock? He wondered and tried to emulate what he&#8217;d seen women do in any of the porn he&#8217;d watched.&nbsp; Suddenly the sharp end jammed roughly into his cheek.&nbsp; An edge of it caught his gum.&nbsp; Kurt almost screamed.&nbsp; He realized Kat was laughing; she&#8217;d done it on purpose.&nbsp; When he maneuvered his tongue and tried to catch the heel again she gave a sharp jerk and ran the end of the stiletto into the top of his mouth.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Angrily he jerked away from her boot and held a hand to his mouth, sure there was blood.&nbsp; �What the fuck Kat?� he shouted.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Instead of reacting Kat merely sighed.&nbsp; �Fuck it slave, I thought you were coming along better than this.�&nbsp; She sighed again, staring intently at Kurt&#8217;s face.&nbsp; The look scalded; he found himself looking to the carpet in shame.  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Now you&#8217;re getting it,� Kat whispered triumphantly.&nbsp; �Now here&#8217;s what I&#8217;m going to let you do.&nbsp; I&#8217;m going to let you clean my other boot and you&#8217;re going to do it so perfectly�so perfectly,� she repeated, �and I&#8217;m going to ignore this little &#8216;incident&#8217; for the time being, but I&#8217;m not going to forget slave.&nbsp; You&#8217;ll be punished for it absolutely.&nbsp; And when it happens you&#8217;ll wish you could come back here and please me by sucking on my heel.&nbsp; Understood?�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Kurt dipped his head in a short bow.&nbsp; �Yes Mistress Kat.�&nbsp; He shuffled forward on his haunches to place himself in front of the boot he hadn&#8217;t touched yet.&nbsp; When she didn&#8217;t raise it up to meet him he got the hint and bowed low to it, touching his tongue to the leather.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Closing his eyes Kurt gave himself entirely to the task.&nbsp; When he opened them briefly he saw Kat had pushed aside her thong and was rapturously thrusting four fingers in and out of her pussy.&nbsp; Her face was a grim mask of concentration and enlightenment.&nbsp; He imagined monks on the cusp of communing with The Holy looked much the same.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Kurt closed his eyes again.&nbsp; It wasn&#8217;t how he&#8217;d expected it to be but somehow or other he was going to make Kat orgasm, really truly cum the way she needed to.&nbsp; It made his head light to think about it.&nbsp; How little he wanted from life, he thought.&nbsp; Just wanted to make his friend cum&#8212;beautifully hard.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He heard Kat moan above him and doubled his efforts, sliding his tongue across the leather of her boots in swirls and crisscrosses.&nbsp; He moved slowly downward and took the point of her toe in his mouth; sucked on it gently.&nbsp; Lifting her foot slightly he maneuvered to get his mouth around her heel.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It seemed the second he put his lips around it Kat let out a sharp shriek and her foot spasmed, catching his lips against the bottom of her boot.&nbsp; The heel ricocheted off his back molars and gouged his tongue.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Fuck, Jesus Fuck!� Kat hissed between her teeth.&nbsp; Kurt stealthily disengaged his mouth and sat slightly back, nursing a swollen lip as Kat gave herself over to her orgasm.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Fuck! Fuck me!� she whispered, eyes clenched shut, head thrown back.&nbsp; Her ponytail spilt across the back of the couch.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Slowly, as the orgasm abated, she opened her eyes and turned her attention to Kurt.&nbsp; Removing her hand from her clenched cunt she leaned forward and touched it to Kurt&#8217;s lips.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Lick my hand clean,� she ordered.&nbsp; He was used to her taste, had obviously tasted her before.&nbsp; But this was different.&nbsp; There was a new odour, something sharper, cleaner about the smell on Kat&#8217;s fingers.&nbsp; He eagerly took each finger of her gloved hand into his mouth, sucking her scent and juices off until her hand was clean and the leather shone.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�How&#8217;s your tongue?� she asked lightly.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Fine Mistress Kat,� Kurt replied.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Good.&nbsp; You know I wasn&#8217;t going to but now I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ll be able to help myself.&nbsp; I&#8217;m going to rape you tonight,� Kat said nonchalantly.&nbsp; �How big a strap-on do you think you can take in your ass right now?� she asked.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Um�� Kurt was lost for words.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Trick question,� Kat laughed.&nbsp; �I&#8217;ll choose.� She slapped him playfully across the face and stood up to stretch.&nbsp; �That was a great orgasm,� she said to no one in particular. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I&#8217;m going to show you where you&#8217;ll be sleeping and keep you there for a bit while I set up okay,� she said oddly.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Oh yeah, I figured I&#8217;d just use the couch; I&#8217;ve got a sleeping bag in the car,� Kurt offered, then added: �Mistress Kat.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Kat looked down at him in mock shock.&nbsp; �A sleeping bag?&nbsp; What for?� she asked, clearly facetiously.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Uh, for the couch,� Kurt tried to explain.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Slave,� she bent down and took his face in both hands, staring intently into his eyes.&nbsp; �If you were still my friend Kurt yes, you&#8217;d be sleeping on the couch.&nbsp; It&#8217;s true.&nbsp; But now you don&#8217;t even have a name; you&#8217;re just my slave.&nbsp; Come on, I&#8217;ll show you where you&#8217;re sleeping tonight.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She stood up and motioned for him to follow.&nbsp; Crawling on all fours, Kurt kept close to Kat&#8217;s stiletto heel.&nbsp; She opened the door to the basement and sauntered down the wooden stairs into her unfinished basement.&nbsp; Kurt had a hell of a time getting down the stairs on his hands and knees but finally managed it.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�You&#8217;ll get better at that,� Kat promised.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Kurt had been in her basement any number of times.&nbsp; Usually to get a white wine out of the fridge she kept in the corner.&nbsp; But today it was different.&nbsp; A large wooden cross in the shape of an &#8216;X&#8217; sat against the wall on a special stand of some kind.&nbsp; Manacles hung from the ceiling.&nbsp; A wooden medieval stockade stood in the middle of the floor taking up space and in front of the fridge was a large steel cage.&nbsp; The end was a swing door that hung open.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Kat walked over to the cage and gestured inside without any ceremony.&nbsp; �Welcome home,� she quipped.&nbsp; �Get in.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Um�okay,� Kurt mumbled and started crawling for the cage.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�The correct answer is &#8216;yes Mistress Kat,&#8217;� Kat said exasperatedly.&nbsp; Kurt realized given his mistake he still had to pass by her to get into the cage.&nbsp; Sure enough her foot lashed out and he caught her heel along his side where it scraped a long red mark that drew blood in one place.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Yes Mistress Kat,� he whimpered.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Kat waited until he was inside and then closed the door behind him.&nbsp; She shot a bolt through the door connections and attached a heavy padlock.&nbsp; Unexpectedly she reached through the cage and took Kurt by the hair again.&nbsp; Viciously she pulled his face to the edge of the bars before leaning in and taking a kiss. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I&#8217;ll be back for you in a bit slave; don&#8217;t get too comfy.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Kurt realized he&#8217;d dozed off when suddenly Kat was just outside the tiny cage unlocking the door.&nbsp; She worked silently.&nbsp; When the door was open she snapped her fingers and indicated a spot immediately next to her foot.&nbsp; Obediently Kurt crawled out, trying to avoid catching the crisscross pattern of the bars on the floor of the cage against his knees.&nbsp; He failed miserably and all but hobbled out onto the cement floor.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Kat silently lifted his chin and attached a long chain leash to Kurt&#8217;s collar.&nbsp; She gave it a few experimental tugs at his expense and, satisfied, turned her attention to his ankles.&nbsp; Quickly she threaded thick leather cuffs around both of them and gave the heavy looking &#8216;D&#8217; rings an almost obsessive compulsive couple of flips.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Satisfied, Kat jerked on his lead to indicate he&#8217;d better follow and led him back up the stairs.&nbsp; They climbed the next set up from the TV room into the living room and kitchen and then climbed again to the small floor where Kat had her bedroom and a small guest room that she never used.&nbsp; He could see that it was dark outside now.&nbsp; Very dark.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Her room startled Kurt.&nbsp; The comforter set he was used to seeing had been replaced by jet black rubber sheets.&nbsp; Several bondage looking devices lay across the bed in a jungle of buckles.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Still working wordlessly Kat jerked Kurt roughly to her side and worked her fingers against the buckles on his collar.&nbsp; The heavy leather ring fell into her waiting hands. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Don&#8217;t get excited slave, this in no way releases you.&nbsp; It&#8217;s going right back on in a second,� she said.&nbsp; Her voice was cut through with an excitement Kurt had barely heard before and always out of context.&nbsp; He realized why she wasn&#8217;t talking.&nbsp; She knew he knew her too well, knew that her voice would give her away.&nbsp; She was on the edge of ecstasy.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Working quickly Kat selected a heavy looking something from the bed and held it up briefly in front of Kurt&#8217;s face.&nbsp; To him it almost looked like a helmet.&nbsp; The only thing he was sure about was that it was meant for his head.&nbsp; Without waiting for him to react, Kat slipped the whole thing over Kurt&#8217;s face and head.&nbsp; With practiced hands she tightened the numerous buckles until it was all but a second skin.&nbsp; The heavy hood completely covered his eyes, ears and nose save two tiny holes for breathing.&nbsp; In a second Kat remedied his mouth too, locking into place a heavy gag that shoved a hard plastic something into his mouth, holding his tongue down.&nbsp; He understood that no skin was visible on his face.&nbsp; He felt Kat&#8217;s slender fingers at his throat and felt the collar loop back around.&nbsp; In a second it was locked in place once more.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Holding his hands gently in the small of his back with one hand, Kat began slipping something heavy over his arms.&nbsp; Kurt felt his arms hustled into an arm sleeve that Kat cinched so tightly his elbows almost touched.&nbsp; She attached the loose ends of the sleeve to his collar and his arms and hands were effectively put out of commission.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Silently Kat pushed his legs apart until he was almost splayed flat on his front.&nbsp; She took the ankle cuffs in her hands and something rattled.&nbsp; In a moment Kurt realized that a solid metal bar of some kind was holding his legs wide apart.&nbsp; He tried experimentally to close them from the uncomfortable position Kat had pushed them to and failed.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Pulling him by the leash Kat succeeded in getting most of Kurt&#8217;s upper body onto the bed.&nbsp; With some help he was able to slither his whole self up on top of the rubber sheets.&nbsp; He felt Kat step up onto the bed and wondered briefly how she could keep her balance in heels.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Unceremoniously she tipped him forward and Kurt fell against the bed flat on his hooded face.&nbsp; He tried to balance himself out by bringing his legs up against his ass and realized he couldn&#8217;t; something was pinning his legs to the bed.&nbsp; It took a second to realize that Kat was standing on the spreader bar between his ankles.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A second realization washed over him.&nbsp; Try as he might he couldn&#8217;t keep his asshole closed for very long.&nbsp; In this position it naturally stopped puckering and hung slightly open.&nbsp; Kat&#8217;s words floated back to him in his mind&#8217;s ear.&nbsp; �I wasn&#8217;t going to but now I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ll be able to help myself.&nbsp; I&#8217;m going to rape you tonight.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Kat was doing something above him and then just as suddenly he felt her bend down near his height.&nbsp; �God has abandoned you,� she whispered in his ear, her voice hoarse, �I am your goddess now.&nbsp; Pray for mercy.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;With that he felt something hard touch the outside edge of his asshole.&nbsp; Oh God no! Kurt thought woefully.&nbsp; With one solid push the strap-on Kat was wearing tore into his ass, rending flesh the whole way.&nbsp; Even the slick coat of lube she&#8217;d given it did nothing to halt the pain.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Kurt howled into his gag, and, failing that, the rubber sheets on his Mistress&#8217; bed.&nbsp; Not satisfied with merely thrusting it in, Kat began to slide the dildo back and forth along the chute of his ass.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He lost track of time; got lost in the pure agony.&nbsp; Occasionally some small movement Kat made caused the experience to be briefly pleasurable before the pain took over once more.&nbsp; And still she didn&#8217;t stop or slow down.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Abusively she hammered her plastic cock in and out of Kurt&#8217;s ass.&nbsp; Randomly switching the rhythm to whatever suited her.&nbsp; Tears balled up on the inside of the hood Kurt wore and sat hotly against his skin.&nbsp; His nose ran, making it hard to breathe in the hood.&nbsp; Every so often Kat would reach forward and shove his head forcefully into the sheets, closing his nostrils against them.&nbsp; No matter how much he struggled for breath he couldn&#8217;t do anything about it.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;How much time passed Kurt didn&#8217;t know until the thrusts of Kat&#8217;s cock became more erratic.&nbsp; Finally she started to moan and in one sudden final agonizing blast deep into his anus, Kurt felt Kat&#8217;s orgasm ripple through the strap-on and vibrate inside of him.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For a moment it was so beautiful that the pain washed away entirely.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Slowly Kat slid her plastic erection&#8212;still hard&#8212;out of her slave&#8217;s ass.&nbsp; He felt her collapse on the bed next to him.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�My God,� she whispered, her voice still shaky.&nbsp; �Now normally at this time I would give you the honor of licking me to a few more orgasms, but I know you well enough to know that besides being exhausted you&#8217;re also in a shitload of pain.&nbsp; Aren&#8217;t you slave?�&nbsp; Kurt tried to nod an affirmative.&nbsp; His ass burned like a small fire had been lit inside of it.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Kat ran a manicured finger over the side of Kurt&#8217;s hooded face.&nbsp; �Do you think you can get up a hard on?� she asked seriously.&nbsp; Leaning close to his ear she whispered: �I want your pathetic slave cock inside of me�now.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To his surprise, Kurt felt an erection springing to life between his legs.&nbsp; The tension made the pain in his ass unbearable and still it came.&nbsp; Kat reached a shiny gloved hand down and stroked her fingers back and forth over the purple helmet.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Good slave.&nbsp; Very good slave.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In a few moments it was ready.&nbsp; Forcing Kurt up into a sitting position she propped his less than mobile body up against the headboard.&nbsp; Sitting face to face she wrapped her legs around him.&nbsp; The feel of her boots against his bare skin made Kurt shiver involuntarily.&nbsp; Kat caught the reaction instantly but said nothing.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Instead she voraciously shoved her vagina over Kurt&#8217;s penis, enveloping it like a Venus fly trap would a treat.&nbsp; Hungrily she slid herself back and forth over Kurt&#8217;s shaft, moaning quietly.&nbsp; In an orgasmic fit she ripped Kurt&#8217;s gag out of his mouth and coupled her own lips to his, robbing him of his breath.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Kurt felt like he was being face raped as Kat&#8217;s tongue darted deep into his throat, almost making him gag.&nbsp; He worked desperately to catch a mouthful of air from time to time as she changed the position of her mouth.&nbsp; He felt Kat&#8217;s body ripple again as an easy orgasm flooded through her.&nbsp; It barely slowed her down.&nbsp; Her mouth continued to lay claim to him while the tight muscles in her pussy claimed his cock for their own.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Kurt realized that in a second he was going to cum inside of her.&nbsp; She must have felt the change in the muscle too because just as he was about to lose control she effortlessly slid backward, setting his member free.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Cum on the bed,� she growled.&nbsp; There was really no choice.&nbsp; Orgasm rocked Kurt&#8217;s body and he spurted his load, again with distance to show, across the rubber sheets.&nbsp; Kat laughed merrily.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I&#8217;ve never seen you come like that,� she said.&nbsp; Kurt didn&#8217;t reply.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Well your mouth is free,� Kat remarked.&nbsp; �Before I put the gag back in you&#8217;re going to lick up all this cum.&nbsp; I have to sleep here tonight after all.� 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She took the back of his head in one hand and deftly led his face to the mess he&#8217;d made.&nbsp; Sticking out his tongue obligingly he lapped up his seed wherever her hand guided him.&nbsp; In a few moments the white globes were no more.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;True to her word, Kat shoved the gag back into his mouth and buckled it to the hood.&nbsp; She expertly unlocked the spreader bar and gave him back the use of his legs.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�It&#8217;s hard to crawl with an arm binder on and you can&#8217;t see where you&#8217;re going.&nbsp; Just this once I&#8217;ll allow you to walk,� Kat said, gathering up his leash in her hand. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Wasting no time she led him out of her room, back down the multitude of stairs and into the basement.&nbsp; Ordering him back to his knees Kat directed him into his cage and noisily closed the door behind him.&nbsp; He heard the lock click home and the footfalls of her stilettos echo away up the stairs.&nbsp; She stopped for a moment to turn off the lights.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It was only then, lying on his side, blind, mute and half deaf, that Kurt realized he was hungry.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Kurt!&nbsp; Oh my God!&nbsp; Kurt!�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Kat&#8217;s voice grabbed hold of Kurt lost somewhere to sleep and catapulted him back to the realm of the waking.&nbsp; His eyes blew open in panic only to find that he still couldn&#8217;t see.&nbsp; Panic immediately set in hard until he remembered where exactly it was he was.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The door to the cage rattled and finally flew open.&nbsp; �Kurt oh my God, are you all right?� Kat shouted, clumsily working at pulling him from the cage.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;With a little help from him she rolled him out the door and immediately set to work yanking the heavy leather hood off his head.&nbsp; Loosening most of the buckles she grabbed hold and reefed it out from underneath the collar.&nbsp; Daylight&#8212;or at least all of it that flooded through the tiny basement windows&#8212;blasted Kurt full on.&nbsp; He scrunched his eyes shut in defense.&nbsp; Kat didn&#8217;t stop though.&nbsp; She turned her attention to the arm binder and rapidly slipped the cords free, yanking it off completely.&nbsp; Kurt&#8217;s arms fell limply to his sides; there was almost no feeling in them.&nbsp; He tried to squeeze his hand into a fist and couldn&#8217;t.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Kat&#8217;s fingers deftly undid the ankle cuffs and slipped them off.&nbsp; A ring of tingling flesh remained.&nbsp; �Kurty, oh God Kurty, what did she do to you?� Kat whimpered.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Kurt opened his eyes to find Kat staring down at him lovingly.&nbsp; She was one hundred percent the Kat he knew and loved.&nbsp; She was wearing her usual tight jeans and a turtle neck sweater&#8212;this one some weird shade of blue.&nbsp; �Kurty are you okay?&nbsp; My God, what are you doing here?�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Kurt looked up at her, the puzzlement must have been written clean across his face.&nbsp; �Uh�I&#8217;m gonna let you answer that okay�uh�Kat.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Oh God Kurty, I&#8217;m so worried.&nbsp; What did she do to you?�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Kat?&nbsp; What the hell are you talking about?� Kurt finally managed.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Kat stopped to stare at him.&nbsp; �Oh God,� she whimpered.&nbsp; �There&#8217;s something I&#8217;ve never told you Kurt; it&#8217;s too strange.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�What?&nbsp; What is?&nbsp; What are you talking about?�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�It&#8217;s me Kurt.&nbsp; There&#8217;s, oh God, there&#8217;s two of me.&nbsp; It&#8217;s called a split personality.&nbsp; The other one is crazy Kurt!&nbsp; She&#8217;s insane.&nbsp; She does anything to get her off.&nbsp; She&#8217;ll kill you baby!� Kat rattled on, tears flowing freely down her face.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Kurt paused to look at his friend, taking her all in.&nbsp; He took the opportunity to stretch out his numb arms and legs and reveled in the cool cement floor not being the bottom of the cage.&nbsp; Kat kept looking at him, crying softly.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�You know I remember you could always do that.&nbsp; Your boyfriends hated it; they never knew if you were actually upset or just a leaky faucet,� Kurt finally said, gesturing to her tears.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Wha--?� Kat asked stunned.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Kurt dug a thumb under the collar she&#8217;d obviously forgotten to remove and flicked it out at her in Shakespearean fashion.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Kat sat back on her haunches and slow cruel smile spread across her lips.&nbsp; �Clever,� she whispered.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Something like that,� Kurt replied.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Kat stood up, apparently happy.&nbsp; �Well it&#8217;s not really Saturday without a good mind fuck,� she said.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Maybe on your calendar,� Kurt replied, dropping back into their usual banter.&nbsp; Another lightening quick backhand from Kat wiped the smile off his face instantly though.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Well you&#8217;re a clever little bitch, but I knew that.�&nbsp; Her hand came back and struck him across the opposite cheek with her open palm.&nbsp; �That&#8217;s for forgetting the &#8216;Mistress&#8217;,� she informed him.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I wasn&#8217;t aware it was mandatory when you were out of character,� Kurt pressed his luck.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Silly slave,� Kat replied lightly, �I&#8217;m always &#8216;in character.&#8217;�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Anyways,� she continued, �you know where the bathroom is.&nbsp; I want you to clean yourself up.&nbsp; I&#8217;ll be in the kitchen.&nbsp; If you&#8217;re quick there might even be some breakfast left for you.�&nbsp; Kat turned and wandered up the stairs, stopping once at the top to turn a cool smile on Kurt, still sprawled embarrassingly across her basement floor.&nbsp; When he heard her climb the stairs up to the kitchen Kurt gathered himself up and moved to the bathroom.&nbsp; He realized halfway up the stairs that he was crawling.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Showered and scrubbed, Kurt crawled his way into the kitchen.&nbsp; The espresso machine he&#8217;d given Kat for some birthday or other gleamed on the counter.&nbsp; How embarrassing, he thought, catching a reflection of his humbled self in its chrome exterior.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Kat had changed out of her jeans and sweater and lounged on a kitchen chair in a tight red corset that rode down over her hips and just over the bottoms of her breasts, pushing them up and out seductively.&nbsp; Kurt felt the need to bite his knuckle or something&#8212;focus his attention elsewhere.&nbsp; Her finely shaved pussy was on full display and black shiny patent leather boots covered her legs almost entirely.&nbsp; Her hair cascaded around her shoulders in the way Kurt was used to.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Without speaking she pointed to a dog dish near her chair.&nbsp; On closer inspection Kurt found it was full of plain oatmeal.&nbsp; Testing it with a finger he found it slightly on the cold side.&nbsp; Sensing his thoughts Kat smiled.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�You should have been quicker in the shower slave,� she chastised. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He gazed into the bowl intently then turned his eyes on Kat.&nbsp; The same cruel smile he&#8217;d seen earlier played across her features again.&nbsp; �Absolutely that&#8217;s all you get slave.&nbsp; Eat up.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Kurt obligingly sunk his face into the bowl, lapping up as much of the oatmeal as he could.&nbsp; His pride stung, his stomach told him otherwise.&nbsp; He was beyond famished.&nbsp; It was vile.&nbsp; When his stomach had had just enough his tongue started to rebel.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Mistress Kat?� he ventured.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She looked down on him from her coffee.&nbsp; �Did you say something slave?�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Yes Mistress Kat.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Did I ask you a question first?� she asked.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�No Mistress Kat, it&#8217;s just, it&#8217;s just so fucking dry!� he blurted out before he could stop himself.&nbsp; Kat took on a look like she was considering his situation.&nbsp; Abruptly she slid down off her chair and squatted squarely over the dog bowl.&nbsp; Reaching out she grasped Kurt&#8217;s hair in her hand and pulled his head close to the bowl while she simply pissed all over the oatmeal.&nbsp; When she was finished she balanced back on one hand and thrust her hips out towards Kurt&#8217;s face.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Lick,� she ordered, already pulling his mouth in close to her pussy.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Kurt closed his eyes and darted his tongue out experimentally once, twice, and then quickly licked the urine away.&nbsp; Kat sat back in her chair and returned to her coffee.&nbsp; Kurt inspected the oatmeal again, now swimming in Kat&#8217;s piss.&nbsp; He was suddenly no longer hungry.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Again anticipating him, Kat interrupted his thoughts.&nbsp; �You&#8217;ll clean that bowl edge to edge or there&#8217;s no lunch or supper for you.&nbsp; Understood?�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Yes Mistress Kat,� Kurt mumbled weakly.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;While his face was buried in the oatmeal that now smelled of pee and tried to choke it down, Kat spoke softly to him, pausing occasionally to take a sip of coffee or finish her bagel.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Today I&#8217;m going to torture you slave.&nbsp; I&#8217;ve got the whole day booked for it,� she almost giggled.&nbsp; �In fact I&#8217;m pretty sure that any uh, remaining will or attitude you might have left will be gone by the end of the day.&nbsp; You probably won&#8217;t be able to sleep; there won&#8217;t be a position you&#8217;ll be comfortable in&#8212;I can guarantee it.&nbsp; I want you to know that anything I do to you today is for my own benefit.&nbsp; I know the last thing you want is pain; but God it&#8217;s going to make me feel absolutely awesome.&nbsp; Understand?� she rattled on, assuming Kurt did.&nbsp; �You&#8217;re definitely going to bleed understand.&nbsp; Maybe a lot.&nbsp; Odds are what I do today will scar you for the rest of your life.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Kurt bolted upright at that, trying to plead silently with Kat.&nbsp; She ignored him.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Slave, I want you to know that I thought about it a lot last night.&nbsp; What I might do to you today and how that&#8217;ll change things.&nbsp; I realized that if it&#8217;s too much I might break you, and then you&#8217;d never be the same again.&nbsp; I know that.&nbsp; I get that.&nbsp; It&#8217;s a risk that I&#8217;m willing to take though,� Kat explained.&nbsp; �I don&#8217;t want to break you okay.&nbsp; So I want you to be strong and please me by taking everything I give you today.&nbsp; Understood?�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Yes Mistress Kat,� Kurt replied.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�How&#8217;s your ass from last night?� Kat asked, changing tracks.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Sore Mistress Kat,� Kurt answered honestly.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Of course.&nbsp; Do you think it stretched a little?� she asked seriously.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Maybe�Mistress Kat.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I hope it did or today is going to be worse for you,� she warned.&nbsp; �There&#8217;s something I have to do first though.&nbsp; It&#8217;s Saturday after all.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Was she serious? Kurt wondered.&nbsp; She had to be bluffing.&nbsp; He knew from experience that mostly every Saturday Kat took the time to call his mother and chat idly about nothing.&nbsp; His mother loved her calls; looked forward to them all week.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Kat took hold of Kurt&#8217;s leash and jerked him forward.&nbsp; There was oatmeal left but he hoped because it was her idea to stop that she wouldn&#8217;t hold it against him.&nbsp; She led him steadily by the leash down to the TV room where her computer was propped in one corner on an IKEA desk.&nbsp; She stopped to pull two large black garbage bags out of the closet.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Oddly, Kat pushed the computer chair clear across the room and then proceeded to spread the garbage bags flat on the floor right in front of the desk.&nbsp; Before he could ask what was going on Kat roughly jerked Kurt&#8217;s leash, making it known he was supposed to move onto the garbage bags.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Kat pushed him in the direction she wanted and then sat squarely on his back at the computer.&nbsp; Dissatisfied she stood up and prodded him a little closer.&nbsp; Sitting again she obviously decided he was in the right spot.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Don&#8217;t fucking move an inch,� she warned, getting up.&nbsp; A few minutes later she returned with a massive red ball gag.&nbsp; Even though he knew where it was going he wasn&#8217;t sure it would fit in his mouth.&nbsp; Kat shoved it in anyways and buckled it uncomfortably tight at the back of his head.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Now,� she said, picking something else up.&nbsp; �As you probably guessed I&#8217;m going to call your mom.&nbsp; You&#8217;re going to sit here and be my stool while I do it.&nbsp; Oh, and something else�� She dangled the something else in front of his face.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A metal dildo with ravenous looking metal spikes down the length of it glared back at him.&nbsp; �Guess where this goes,� Kat offered.&nbsp; He was about to resist before she sat on him again.&nbsp; �Good guess,� she laughed, smacking his ass with a bare hand gleefully.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She picked up the phone next to the computer and dialed a number Kurt knew off by heart.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Hi Ginette, yeah it&#8217;s me.&nbsp; How are you?�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Oh I&#8217;m great.&nbsp; Better than I&#8217;ve been in a long long time actually.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Oh, no reason I guess.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Kurt felt the end of the cold dildo touch his anus.&nbsp; It puckered instantly but Kat was undeterred, slowly forcing it into his shaft.&nbsp; He&#8217;d seen the small metal teeth.&nbsp; It&#8217;s going to shred me up inside, he almost wailed.&nbsp; Suddenly the garbage bags made perfect sense.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As each individual spike found purchase inside his asshole and then slowly began ripping their way forward Kat continued her lively conversation with his mother.&nbsp; Tears sprung to Kurt&#8217;s eyes almost instantly.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�No I haven&#8217;t seen Kurt in a while.&nbsp; I think he&#8217;s busy with work.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Oh yeah, we talk all the time.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Okay I&#8217;ll tell him.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Abruptly Kat rotated the dildo inside his ass and pulled it in the opposite direction.&nbsp; The teeth found new purchase and ripped their way free of his asshole.&nbsp; A full fledged scream erupted in his throat and all but died at the gag.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�No, but there&#8217;s a cat that&#8217;s been caterwauling all morning outside somewhere,� Kat told Kurt&#8217;s mother.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Yeah I know; sounds like it&#8217;s in pain or something.&nbsp; Like it&#8217;s got something sharp jammed up its ass.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Gruesome I know.&nbsp; Sorry.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She rotated the dildo again and plunged it back in.&nbsp; The teeth shredded flesh.&nbsp; Something warm began to trickle down the insides of Kurt&#8217;s legs.&nbsp; He didn&#8217;t have to look to know it was his own blood.&nbsp; He screamed into the gag again and began to whimper.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�No you didn&#8217;t tell me about that,� Kat continued.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Wow, that&#8217;s great!&nbsp; I&#8217;m glad to hear it.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;ll be fine.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Well like I said I haven&#8217;t seen him.&nbsp; Maybe I&#8217;ll just have to wander over on my own for coffee.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Well you know me.&nbsp; I work when I want.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Not this weekend.&nbsp; Something special came up.&nbsp; Kind of a vacation you might say.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I might see him Sunday if he survives.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Well I remember him saying this weekend was going to be hell on him or something.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Yeah why he can&#8217;t phone and tell you himself I have no idea.&nbsp; It&#8217;s not like he&#8217;s gagged up somewhere.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Oh would you, that&#8217;d be great.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I haven&#8217;t been down there lately actually.&nbsp; It&#8217;s a sin I know.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Please do.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Kat continued on like that, chatting idly with Kurt&#8217;s mother.&nbsp; Occasionally, randomly, she would crank the metal dildo in Kurt&#8217;s ass or jerk it out then ram it in again.&nbsp; Blood flowed steadily down his legs to pool around his knees on the garbage bags.&nbsp; Each aggressive attack of the dildo elicited a primal howl from deep inside his chest.&nbsp; The gag muffled most of them almost perfectly.&nbsp; Between screams he was reduced to a continual sobbing as the inside of his ass was rendered unrecognizable.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I agree, I should put the thing out of its misery,� she laughed, obviously talking about the &#8216;cat&#8217;.&nbsp; �All right Ginette, I&#8217;ll talk to you later.&nbsp; Love you too.�&nbsp; She hung up the phone.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Your mom is so nice,� she said, tapping Kurt on the head like he was a good pet.&nbsp; Slowly she pulled the hated dildo out, giving it a final harsh yank at the end.&nbsp; She examined it giddily.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�God that&#8217;s so hot,� she whispered to herself.&nbsp; Kat thumped Kurt&#8217;s head again lightly.&nbsp; �Because I like you I&#8217;m going to give you an hour to recuperate.&nbsp; Don&#8217;t stray off the plastic,� she ordered and got up.&nbsp; Almost instantly Kurt collapsed to his side, moaning into his gag.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Less than an hour later, drifting rapidly in and out of sleep, Kurt came awake to Kat&#8217;s boots in front of his face.&nbsp; �Play time slave,� she said simply.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Slowly he maneuvered onto his back and found himself looking up at Kat&#8217;s perfectly tight pussy.&nbsp; A pang of desire flowed through him unbidden, hardening the muscles in his ass which in turn rippled waves of agony back up his body.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I&#8212;I can&#8217;t Kat.&nbsp; I just can&#8217;t.&nbsp; I can&#8217;t take anymore,� he whimpered into the gag.&nbsp; It came out as muffled babble.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Undeterred Kat wrapped the chain lead around her hand and jerked her uncooperative slave up to a crawling position.&nbsp; Pulling viciously on the leash she forced him down the stairs back to the basement.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Working fast she forced Kurt to his knees.&nbsp; Dragging on the leash she pulled his head back, causing him to arch wildly back over his heels.&nbsp; She slipped the ankle cuffs back on and locked a short spreader bar to them making it nearly impossible for Kurt to move his feet further apart than a few inches.&nbsp; Attaching a short chain to the back of Kurt&#8217;s collar, Kat tied it to the spreader bar between his ankles.&nbsp; His knees were taking all the stress, folded back like a crescendo mark.&nbsp; Desperately he tried to spread his legs further apart to balance his weight.&nbsp; Kat assisted merrily, strapping heavy thigh cuffs across his legs and forcing an extending spreader bar between them.&nbsp; Maliciously she increased the length until it felt like Kurt&#8217;s legs would split off at his groin.&nbsp; Naturally his hands fell back to support himself behind him.&nbsp; Kat however wouldn&#8217;t have it and wrapping cuffs around his wrists attached them to the ankle cuffs. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Bent backward, his arms immobilized, Kurt whimpered softly into his gag.&nbsp; Kat strolled around to face him, a crop resting in her hands.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Put your chest out slave,� she ordered.&nbsp; Kurt could barely move in his contorted position.&nbsp; The chain around his neck made it difficult to thrust anything in any direction.&nbsp; What little effort he could make seemed to please Kat at least.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The crop rained down unannounced across his right nipple, scalding the skin and battering the little ball of flesh.&nbsp; Kurt howled into his gag.&nbsp; Her second stroke connected perfectly with his right nipple causing the same reaction.&nbsp; Try as he might, Kurt couldn&#8217;t sink into the ball he tried to be.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Jesus Fucking God you&#8217;re killing me!� he raged into his gag.&nbsp; It came out as so much unintelligible babble.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Twenty more&#8212;each,� Kat informed him.&nbsp; �Think of it like exercise slave.&nbsp; This is the warm up.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;True to her word Kat inflicted a full twenty strokes across Kurt&#8217;s nipples.&nbsp; By the time the last stroke fell he&#8217;d fallen into a state of mental unconsciousness.&nbsp; The pain had ebbed its way into a more or less constant state that he&#8217;d simply grown to accept as all consuming.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The day wore on interminably.&nbsp; Kat moved him from bondage to bondage whenever it suited her.&nbsp; Hanging upside down from the roof she almost flayed the skin completely off his ass before locking him back in the cage and laughing while he tried to avoid the wax she spilt down on him.&nbsp; When she hung him by his wrists to lash the wax off again Kurt passed out momentarily.&nbsp; Either Kat didn&#8217;t notice or she knew her next slash would bring him back around.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Tears ran freely down his face, dripping on the floor when they could, running over the gag in his mouth.&nbsp; He looked down at his body, scared senseless by the plethora of red marks running everywhere.&nbsp; Thin streams of blood ran where Kat had broken the skin either accidentally or on purpose.&nbsp; He could feel whole pools of blood on his ass where she had all but devastated his skin.&nbsp; He knew then that all of his beliefs that were he ever captured on a field of battle he could survive interrogation were a total joke.&nbsp; It felt like he was rushing towards a wall somewhere on the edge of his perception.&nbsp; Somewhere during the day he&#8217;d forgotten who he was, what he was.&nbsp; He knew only that if Kat kept it up that he would break just like she&#8217;d feared.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Snap clean in half.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And then just as abruptly as she&#8217;d somersaulted him into this new world of inhuman agony, she released him again.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Undoing his bonds, Kat let him slip silently to the floor.&nbsp; Instantly Kurt tried to curl into a ball only to find the wounds all over his body to be too much.&nbsp; Defeated, he instead just laid as still as he could, staring up at Kat hopelessly.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Kat bent down and lovingly removed the ball gag; even taking took the time to run her finger around the edge of Kurt&#8217;s mouth to catch any leftover drool.&nbsp; Kurt tried to speak and then remembered the rule.&nbsp; He would wait until spoken to.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I know I told you that the collar would come off Sunday night,� Kat said, �but I&#8217;m giving you the option now slave.&nbsp; Take it off now and you get to go back to being regular Kurt and I&#8217;ll go back to being regular Kat and this will just be a memory,� she offered.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Kurt&#8217;s fingers jumped to the collar.&nbsp; He ran them over the surface experimentally, as if testing it for weaknesses.&nbsp; His brain shouted at him: all you have to do is slip those buckles free.&nbsp; Come on genius!&nbsp; But his fingers wouldn&#8217;t obey.&nbsp; Kat watched his internal struggle with rapt attention.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Slowly Kurt crawled up onto his knees and sat like a Japanese tea master.&nbsp; Small abrasions on his knees and shins made staying seated difficult but he endured.&nbsp; He touched a slow finger to the first buckle, then the second.&nbsp; Guardedly he raised his head and stared up into Kat&#8217;s whirlpool eyes.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;With a final flourish Kurt dropped his hands to his lap and bowed his head.&nbsp; He stayed silent.&nbsp; Kat reached a hand out and gripped his hair tightly, giving it a test tug.&nbsp; She slowly pulled his head back until he was looking up at her.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Open your mouth slave,� she ordered.&nbsp; Without thinking Kurt dropped his jaw open.&nbsp; Through her smile Kat dropped a stream of saliva into his waiting mouth.&nbsp; With her free hand she pushed his jaw closed.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I&#8217;m proud of you slave.&nbsp; Very proud.&nbsp; I want you in your cage now&#8212;�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Mistress please�� Kurt interrupted to beg.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I want you in your cage now,� Kat continued as if she&#8217;d never been stopped, �and I want you to wait for me there.&nbsp; I&#8217;ll cook some supper for us and then we&#8217;ll spend the evening together.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Kurt&#8217;s eyes widened automatically.&nbsp; �Don&#8217;t worry,� Kat laughed, �I think you&#8217;ve taken all the torture you can today.&nbsp; I have something much softer and special-er planned for after dinner.�&nbsp; She walked across and opened the cage door.&nbsp; �Don&#8217;t make me drag you in,� she commanded.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Beaten, Kurt bowed his head and crawled readily into the cage.&nbsp; When he was inside Kat shut the door but didn&#8217;t lock it.&nbsp; They both knew he would be waiting for her when she returned.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Linguine and clams,� Kat said in way of greeting.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She opened the cage door and instead of pulling Kurt out, tossed a plate covered in pasta and small clam sauce in.&nbsp; �You may use your hands.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Thank you Mistress Kat,� Kurt said gratefully.&nbsp; As he downed the slippery pasta, an act made even more difficult by the oily sauce, Kat leaned against the pillory and watched him, a bemused smile across her face.&nbsp; Stiff and sore, Kurt still managed to finish the whole meal in a few short minutes.&nbsp; Like a hungry dog he licked the plate clean.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Remember that motion for the next time you clean my boots,� Kat remarked.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Yes Mistress Kat,� Kurt agreed.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Give me your leash,� Kat commanded, holding out her hand expectantly.&nbsp; Kurt complied.&nbsp; She gave it a short sadistic tug before letting it fall slack.&nbsp; Slowly, like performing calculus, Kat wrapped the chain around and around her hand until Kurt&#8217;s neck was less than a finger&#8217;s length away.&nbsp; Spreading her other hand on the top of his head she firmly pushed his face level to her bare pussy.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�That plate licking thing isn&#8217;t going to work here though,� Kat warned him, �by the way, any other time you&#8217;ve done this you&#8217;ve never made me cum, so I wouldn&#8217;t fall back on old standards either.&nbsp; You&#8217;ve got five minutes to make me cum so hard my knees buckle or what I did to you this morning will seem like a light yoga routine.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Motivated by sheer fear of what Kat could do to him, Kurt stuck his tongue out and immediately got to work.&nbsp; She was right; his first instinct was to duplicate what he had done once or twice in the past when his face found itself in her pussy.&nbsp; He had to consciously change things up.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Kurt worked tirelessly, darting his tongue in and out, sideways, stretching it, flattening it deep into Kat&#8217;s cunt, searching out the clitoris and desperately trying to make it sing.&nbsp; He could feel the five minutes waning on and Kat wasn&#8217;t even moaning yet.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He looked up, trying to catch her eye.&nbsp; �Please Mistress Kat,� Kurt croaked, his lips sticky with Kat&#8217;s juices, �I need more time.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I&#8217;ll say,� Kat smiled.&nbsp; �Get on your back.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Kurt looked behind him at the concrete floor but his legs were already unfolding and before he knew it he was lying flat out staring up at the ceiling.&nbsp; This immediately before Kat&#8217;s descending pussy lips took over the view and blotted out his world.&nbsp; With ferocious intensity Kat slid herself over Kurt&#8217;s face, committing his mouth, his nose and most of his eyes to the darkness between her legs.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Instinctively Kurt&#8217;s tongue darted out and he rapidly began the task of getting Kat to cum while his air ran out.&nbsp; When he began squirming Kat slowly slid herself towards his chin, releasing Kurt&#8217;s nose from a unique bondage and presenting her clit for far easier access to his tongue.&nbsp; Getting the hint, Kurt stretched his tongue out, dipping deep between Kat&#8217;s lips, searching for the bud that might bring him salvation.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Finding it he turned his full efforts there until Kat&#8217;s clitoris emerged from its tiny home like a pearl demanding his attention.&nbsp; Kurt knew he&#8217;d found the necessary spot when Kat suddenly grabbed his head in both hands and held his face captive deep in her pussy.&nbsp; His tongue didn&#8217;t stop.&nbsp; Her juices began to fill his nose and coated his eyelashes but he didn&#8217;t stop.&nbsp; Couldn&#8217;t stop.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Somewhere past the five minute mark Kat suddenly dug her nails into the top of Kurt&#8217;s head; her whole body went rigid and a soft hiss of a moan escaped from between her lips.&nbsp; Still she held Kurt&#8217;s head rapt.&nbsp; Like constrictor snakes, Kat&#8217;s legs sprung up of their own accord, wrapping themselves around Kurt&#8217;s head and shoulders, holding him tight.&nbsp; Just as Kurt feared he&#8217;d used the last of his air, Kat&#8217;s living rigor mortis&#8212;caused by her French tiny death&#8212;relaxed a little and she slowly released her legs and then gently lowered Kurt&#8217;s head to the floor.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Knowing Kat, Kurt pulled his legs up and Kat happily settled back onto his chest, resting against the chair Kurt&#8217;s thighs created.&nbsp; �Good slave,� she whispered knowingly.&nbsp; �We have to work on your pleasuring skills though; they leave something to be desired.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I&#8217;m sorry Mistress Kat,� Kurt apologized.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Kat took the chain of Kurt&#8217;s leash in her hand again and distractedly, almost idly, began wrapping it around her hand once more.&nbsp; Kurt knew better though; he&#8217;d known her far to long to know she did nothing idly.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�What are you thinking?� she asked.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Sweet God, was she serious?&nbsp; Today she&#8217;d quietly humiliated him while she spoke to his mother on the phone, had nearly beaten him to death, forced him to eat with his hands off the floor and then all but face raped him, putting his tongue to use as her own personal sex toy and now she was asking &#8216;what he was thinking&#8217;.&nbsp; It was like some stereotypical nightmare question.&nbsp; He&#8217;d answered the question wrong enough on countless other occasions to know there was no right answer either.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Unbelievable!!
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Uh&#8212;I&#8217;m uh&#8212;well I guess I&#8217;m thinking�uh...what you want to do next,� he tried.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Kat nodded her head thoughtfully.&nbsp; �Good answer, good answer.&nbsp; I like that.&nbsp; Very &#8216;other centered&#8217;, which is a good trait to have in a slave, it&#8217;s true.&nbsp; It&#8217;s not the right answer though,� she whispered menacingly, leaning close to Kurt&#8217;s face.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Knew it! Kurt thought triumphantly.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�The right answer,� Kat continued, �is: &#8216;nothing Mistress.&nbsp; You haven&#8217;t given me permission to think,� she said seriously.
�Yes Mistress Kat, I understand,� Kurt replied.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Good.&nbsp; I&#8217;m glad.&nbsp; Get up,� Kat said.&nbsp; She stood up and pulled Kurt along with her.&nbsp; He gave a little resistance when it seemed she would pull him to his feet and dropped heavily onto his knees.&nbsp; Kat&#8217;s grip on the leash prevented him from falling to all fours like a true slave.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I think today&#8217;s lessons had some effect,� Kat remarked, slowly relinquishing the chain until Kurt was able to crawl.&nbsp; Keeping a tight hold on the leash still, Kat led him up the stairs&#8212;all the way up&#8212;once more to her room.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The rubber sheets were still there.&nbsp; Immediately Kurt&#8217;s asshole froze in terror.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Get up on the bed and lay on your back slave,� Kat commanded.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Yes Mistress Kat,� Kurt mumbled, moving immediately to fulfill her desire.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Working methodically Kat crawled under the bed and after a minute or two reappeared, pulling a chain from each corner of the mattress.&nbsp; �I screwed rings into the bed frame,� she explained.&nbsp; Kurt wondered if those rings had been there when one or the other of them had been lonely enough to encourage a meeting together on the same bed he was now sprawled naked on wearing only the collar that marked him as Kat&#8217;s personal property and some wrist and ankle cuffs.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Kat stretched the chains enough to attach them to the cuffs on Kurt&#8217;s ankles and wrists then stood back a moment to admire her handiwork.&nbsp; Slowly, almost lovingly, she climbed on top of his prone body.&nbsp; Touching her hands to his chest she smiled down at him.&nbsp; Her boots ran down his sides producing sparks of desire wherever they brushed his skin.&nbsp; Slowly Kat reached around her back and loosened the red corset, finally pulling it away from her body.&nbsp; For the first time her naked body dazzled Kurt like a visitation from God.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Reaching over his head, Kat pulled open the night table drawer and rummaged.&nbsp; Kurt tried to strain his head to see what she was doing but couldn&#8217;t get a clear view.&nbsp; When she found what she wanted Kat closed the drawer, careful to keep her prize out of Kurt&#8217;s sight.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;His body ached.&nbsp; Where the bed touched him&#8212;everywhere&#8212;small balls of agony shouted out.&nbsp; His skin was flayed, his ass reduced to a hamburger.&nbsp; Even the backs of his legs, right down to his ankles hadn&#8217;t escaped Kat&#8217;s ministrations. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Kurt tried his best to look like a sad puppy.&nbsp; �Please Mistress, I can&#8217;t take anymore pain,� he begged.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Kat cocked her head, regarding him coolly.&nbsp; �If I want you to you&#8217;ll take so much pain right here, right now, that you&#8217;ll pass out and die.&nbsp; Don&#8217;t forget it.&nbsp; Right now though I want something different although I&#8217;m considering now some wax to teach you a lesson.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Kurt moved to shake his head in protestation but caught it in time.&nbsp; Kat reached over his head and with one slick movement pulled a blindfold down over his eyes. �You know slave.&nbsp; When you can&#8217;t see, everything&#8217;s amplified.&nbsp; Pain�and pleasure.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Kurt felt Kat&#8217;s fingers run lightly over the tip of his cock.&nbsp; Near instantly it stood at a slight angle, working its way up to full attention.&nbsp; Kat barely gave it the time.&nbsp; Sliding backward she assisted it up against the edge of her pussy.&nbsp; With one swift slide she took him completely inside her.&nbsp; The move was excruciating, semi-flaccid as he was.&nbsp; Once inside Kat&#8217;s vagina though Kurt&#8217;s erection came alive, pressing up into her.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�That&#8217;s it slave,� she whispered encouragement.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Pinned like Kurt was, it was Kat who controlled their movements.&nbsp; Pushing off of his chest she rhythmically pounded herself up and down on his cock.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�My God,� she purred, �We&#8217;ve&#8212;we&#8217;ve done this before and it&#8217;s never&#8212;never&#8212;been like this,� Kat let out a soft moan.&nbsp; Kurt opened his mouth to answer her and was rewarded with her hand in his mouth, her fingers pressing down into the back of his throat.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Rotating her hips at a sharp angle she brought Kurt to the brink of orgasm.&nbsp; �Beg to cum slave,� she ordered.&nbsp; In response he threw a glance from behind his blindfold down at her fingers, still in his mouth.&nbsp; �Beg,� she repeated, not removing her hand.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Kurt mumbled through his unique gag, begging for release.&nbsp; Instead Kat stood up, releasing Kurt&#8217;s cock from her grasp.&nbsp; A long mournful wail escaped his lips.&nbsp; Reaching back into the night table drawer Kat retrieved a cock ring and fitted it mercilessly down Kurt&#8217;s shaft.&nbsp; �Women,� she explained, �as you probably know, are multi-orgasmic.&nbsp; Men: if you&#8217;re lucky, you can milk four orgasms out of them in a night and then they bitch all the next day.&nbsp; You&#8217;re no good to me used up,� she explained.&nbsp; �If you&#8217;re lucky you&#8217;ll cum once tonight.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She uncurled her legs and rested back in the crux between Kurt&#8217;s thighs, freeing his mouth.&nbsp; Casually she presented the heel of her boot to Kurt&#8217;s lips.&nbsp; �Let&#8217;s see if you&#8217;ve gotten any better at this while I wait for you to come off edge,� she instructed.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Willingly Kurt took the heel in his mouth, sucking on it like a cock.&nbsp; When Kat viciously rammed it further down his throat Kurt was ready for it and didn&#8217;t stop sucking.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Very good slave; looks like you can be taught new tricks after all.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Kat rode him intermittently the whole night.&nbsp; Her orgasms coming faster and faster, she slipped away each time Kurt sat on the edge of one of his own.&nbsp; Between raping him she stretched along his body, toying with his nipples and stroking his cock to get it hard once more for her use.&nbsp; If he nodded off she would wait until he&#8217;d just slipped under the cover of sleep before slapping him&#8212;hard&#8212;across the face, bringing him around again for her pleasure.&nbsp; She removed the blindfold to have the pleasure of gazing into his eyes.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As the night became directly proportional to the intense flaming in his cock, Kurt began to realize that somehow he and Kat had become different people.&nbsp; She was right.&nbsp; As long as they&#8217;d known each other, and all the feelings they held for each other, now, here, he had become an object, a toy for her perverted uses.&nbsp; It shocked him to realize that not only was he not in control at all anymore, their shared history would not save him from whatever Kat wanted.&nbsp; Here he was, tied to the bed, completely immobile.&nbsp; He wasn&#8217;t play acting or helping Kat get her jollies off.&nbsp; She had tied him to the bed and was now using his body exactly as she saw fit.&nbsp; If he resisted she would injure him as she had earlier.&nbsp; His sides, indeed everything from his ankles to his hairline screamed in agony each time Kat thrust herself against him, and ultimately him into the bed.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He was suffering for her and it made her horny at which point she found uses for his tongue, his body and his cock to get her off in the way she needed.&nbsp; A shiver of fear ran through him.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Kat stopped.&nbsp; �Whoa,� she whispered.&nbsp; �What was that?�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I just realized something,� Kurt whispered.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�And that was��
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Kat&#8212;� her glare stopped him.&nbsp; He realized he was right.&nbsp; �Mistress Kat, I just realized that this is the real thing for you isn&#8217;t it.&nbsp; You need a man like this,� he gestured at the cuffs and the chains pinning him to the bed.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Kat thought about it for a moment, gently lowering herself fully onto Kurt&#8217;s cock.&nbsp; He could feel the muscles deep in her vagina pulsing and contracting against it.&nbsp; �God you have no idea.&nbsp; For what it&#8217;s worth slave, I&#8217;m glad you&#8217;re that man,� she finally said.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I get that too.&nbsp; I understand Kat&#8212;I mean Mistress Kat&#8212;I know what it means to you.&nbsp; I understand the position now.&nbsp; This is who you are all the time, and then there&#8217;s the Kat most everyone else sees.&nbsp; For the first time I know both of you.&nbsp; It&#8217;s like Buddhist enlightenment or something,� Kurt babbled.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A shiver tremored through Kat&#8217;s pussy.&nbsp; She touched a finger to Kurt&#8217;s lips.&nbsp; �Oh my slave, that�that&#8212;that makes me�so happy to hear you say that.� Kat bent down and kissed Kurt heavily on the lips, forcing her tongue past his teeth into the depths of his throat.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When she removed her lips from his Kurt finished what he&#8217;d set out to say.&nbsp; �There&#8217;s just one thing��
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Kat raised an eyebrow but didn&#8217;t interrupt. Absently she started rooting around in the dresser drawer again and came back with a ball-gag.&nbsp; Something in Kurt&#8217;s eyes stayed her hand momentarily.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�What happens when you get bored with a slave then?&nbsp; Even me?&nbsp; What happens then?� Kurt asked.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Kat leaned in close and kissed him on the bridge of his nose.&nbsp; �Silly slave.&nbsp; You should know that as a woman, we tend to&#8212;at least on the whole&#8212;once we make an emotional connection we tend to stick with it,� she explained.&nbsp; �But I&#8217;m glad you asked.&nbsp; And I guess when I get really bored with a slave I&#8217;ll have them auctioned off and find a new one.�&nbsp; She passed a beat.&nbsp; �Even you.�&nbsp; Kat winked and effortlessly slid the ball gag into Kurt&#8217;s mouth.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Now slave.&nbsp; For that deep introspection I think you&#8217;ve earned the right to cum once don&#8217;t you.&nbsp; Of course you don&#8217;t have an opinion do you.&nbsp; Good for you,� Kat laughed and roughly removed the cock ring.&nbsp; Sliding back onto Kurt&#8217;s cock she rapidly brought herself to orgasm.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Kurt beat her there though.&nbsp; With a roar into the gag he launched his seed deep inside of his Mistress.&nbsp; His cock screamed with the effort.&nbsp; Kat kept pumping however until her own body shook as she came.&nbsp; Exhausted she slipped across Kurt&#8217;s wide open chest, occasionally tweaking a nipple with her finger nail out of interest.&nbsp; Kurt&#8217;s penis stayed buried inside of her.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The sun was streaming through Kat&#8217;s bedroom windows when Kurt slowly rolled around to consciousness.&nbsp; Kat was still draped across him, the edge of his member still resting softly in the crux of her sex.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Sensing the life in him Kat slowly came to, rolling her eyes up to find Kurt staring down at her as best he could.&nbsp; Her fluffy hair got in the view.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Morning slave,� she said lightly.&nbsp; They&#8217;d both fallen asleep.&nbsp; The gag still filled Kurt&#8217;s mouth importantly.&nbsp; Kat reached up and removed it casually, like pulling off a band-aid.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�My God it&#8217;s Sunday,� Kurt mentioned.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�You want to go to church or something?� Kat asked.&nbsp; Kurt kind of chuckled.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Actually I was wondering if you wanted to get brunch or something,� Kurt said.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Kat seemed to mull this over.&nbsp; �Okay,� she finally relented, �let&#8217;s do it.&nbsp; The usual place?�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Yeah sure, I mean if you want&#8212;�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Not a question,� Kat interrupted, putting a finger to his lips theatrically.&nbsp; Kurt started to get up; remembered the shackles.&nbsp; God, everything hurt.&nbsp; His body had dissolved into a general all consuming ache.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Where are you going?� Kat asked.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�To get dressed.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�You are dressed.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�For the restaurant I mean.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Kat coolly stared down her nose at Kurt.&nbsp; Slowly she sighed, reached over and undid first his right cuff and then the left, setting his arms free.&nbsp; Silently she repeated the process on his feet.&nbsp; With a rush, a tingle of stabbing pain slipped into his digits.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Go run a bath,� she ordered.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Huh.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Slave. Now!� Kat&#8217;s voice jumped a level only briefly.&nbsp; Kurt nodded and slid off the bed silently and made for the bathroom.&nbsp; He&#8217;d never been in Kat&#8217;s Jacuzzi tub before but he knew she loved to soak in it.&nbsp; He&#8217;d bought her some kind of oil bath&#8212;or was that bath oil&#8212;that the girl at the bath and crap shop had recommended for a birthday present once.&nbsp; He cranked the taps on and tested the temperature.&nbsp; This thing was going to take forever to fill he moaned to himself.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Use cold water,� he heard Kat instruct from the bedroom.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Uh, okay,� he mumbled.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Kurt cranked the hot water tap off and waited the excruciating interval until the tub looked full.&nbsp; Happily he turned off the tap.&nbsp; What was up he had no idea.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Kat obviously heard the water shut off because he heard her moving around the bedroom outside the ensuite.&nbsp; She slithered into the bathroom with a seductive swish to her hips.&nbsp; To Kurt&#8217;s surprise she was still wearing her boots and had a rubber skintight black glove on her right arm that stretched up to her shoulder.&nbsp; Her other hand was bare.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Weird.&nbsp; Kurt sat on the edge of the tub watching her.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�You don&#8217;t usually bath in cold water do you?� Kurt asked half serious.&nbsp; He was genuinely curious.&nbsp; Kat didn&#8217;t reply, didn&#8217;t even reward him with a smile or a look of any kind.&nbsp; Instead she walked confidently to his side and decisively grabbed Kurt&#8217;s hair with her glove hand, sinking her fingers down to his scalp, taking total control of his head.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;With an unexpected jerk she pulled Kurt off balance, knocking him to the floor.&nbsp; His knees connected to the tile with a painful thump.&nbsp; Without stopping Kat thrust Kurt&#8217;s head into the water.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Without warning, without a breath, in the icy chill Kurt felt his throat constrict; felt his lungs screaming for air.&nbsp; Instantly he started struggling against Kat&#8217;s grip but couldn&#8217;t get any leverage.&nbsp; With a snort he pulled water up his nose and hacked it back out.&nbsp; He started convulsing under the water.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mercifully Kat pulled his head out with a jerk, pulling his soaking head back so that he looked straight at the ceiling.&nbsp; She filled his vision menacingly.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I&#8217;m worried,� she said.&nbsp; �I&#8217;m worried you&#8217;ve forgotten something.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I haven&#8217;t&#8212;�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�You&#8217;ve forgotten that you&#8217;re a slave,� she curled her lips in a snarl around the word while curling his hair in her fist, �and whose slave you are you fucking little piece of shit.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Without flourish she plunged Kurt&#8217;s head back into the water.&nbsp; Seeing it coming he caught a quick gulp of air but it failed him almost immediately after hitting the cold water.&nbsp; He&#8217;d been thrashing for what seemed like an epoch, blackness started to crowd in on the edges of his eyes.&nbsp; Kat felt his struggles growing weak.&nbsp; Finally she pulled him out of the tub.&nbsp; She put an ear near his lips.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;With a terrific splutter Kurt coughed up water in a hacking hoarse explosion.&nbsp; �Mistress,� he whispered, �I&#8217;m sorry Mistress.&nbsp; Mistress Kat.&nbsp; Mistress��
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�It may have seemed like a bright sunny brunch day like before but its not.&nbsp; We&#8217;ll go to Alex&#8217;s because I like it there too.&nbsp; You know that.&nbsp; But you&#8217;ll go in the collar; I&#8217;ll order for you, you&#8217;ll ask permission before eating.&nbsp; When Candy flirts with you like usual when she brings the coffee you&#8217;ll ask me for permission to speak to her and we&#8217;ll see how that goes.&nbsp; Understood?�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Yes Mistress Kat,� Kurt immediately replied.&nbsp; It brought on another round of coughing.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Now.&nbsp; I think you&#8217;ve remembered the lessons but I&#8217;m not sure you&#8217;ve learned them,� Kat whispered darkly.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Kurt shot his wet eyes towards her, bald begging in them.&nbsp; An icy smile crept across Kat&#8217;s lips.&nbsp; �Are you scared Kurty?�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Yes Mistress Kat.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Good.&nbsp; You&#8217;re learning then.&nbsp; You see, you&#8217;re not hard at all.&nbsp; You can&#8217;t even get hard, your body&#8217;s using all its energy just to keep you alive in there,� she motioned at the tub with her head, �but me, I&#8217;ve got a rubber glove on so the cold doesn&#8217;t bother me and if I were to let you touch me you&#8217;d see just how fucking wet this is making me.&nbsp; You&#8217;re not having fun, you&#8217;re scared.&nbsp; I&#8217;m the only one getting her rocks off slave.&nbsp; Get used to it.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Yes Mistress Kat.&nbsp; I understand,� Kurt whispered.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�That&#8217;s good.&nbsp; I&#8217;m happy for you.&nbsp; But I don&#8217;t want there to be a repeat Kurty; I think you need some more convincing.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Kurt violently shook his head until Kat reined it in with his hair.&nbsp; �Please no Mistress.&nbsp; Please don&#8217;t,� he fairly choked the last words.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Slave, I&#8217;m going to put you back under the water do you understand?&nbsp; I could give you some number like, a minute for every time you&#8217;ve forgotten to answer me when spoken to or didn&#8217;t call me Mistress since you woke up, but that would be unfair to me.&nbsp; So I&#8217;m going to hold your head under until I feel like bringing you back out again.&nbsp; You might pass out.&nbsp; I&#8217;ll probably even cum too.&nbsp; Now I&#8217;m going to let you take a big breath and then you&#8217;re going to willingly let me put you under.&nbsp; When you&#8217;re under you can think about all of the ways you pissed me off this morning and how, as a little fuck slave, you can make up for them.&nbsp; Ready?�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Kurt felt tears running down his cheeks.&nbsp; Obediently he pulled in two lungfuls of air.&nbsp; He shot one final pleading glance in Kat&#8217;s direction which she simply ignored and roughly shoved his head back under the water. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She waited.&nbsp; Waited through him holding his breath and through his vain struggles and his weak struggles and finally when he&#8217;d stopped moving sans a minor twitch or two she jerked him free of the water and flopped him on his back.&nbsp; The motion knocked his lungs and with a splutter Kurt coughed up a lungful of water, rolled on his side and vomited, before slowly rolling onto his back, weak and alive. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Kat slid down the side of the tub, all but unconscious.&nbsp; A silent orgasm blew through her tissues like a street racer.&nbsp; She&#8217;d never had anything like it.&nbsp; She tried to moan, to scream, but like being in a dream no sound came out.&nbsp; Her eyes rolled up into her head and her hand shot out of its own accord to find her sex.&nbsp; Without warning she fell forward onto her forehead.&nbsp; Her breath was so shallow it was barely there. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Kurt struggled onto his side.&nbsp; His first thought was that Kat was having a seizure.&nbsp; Instinctively he reached out to her.&nbsp; �Kat?&nbsp; Are you okay?�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Her hand shot up and locked around his wrist in a steel grip.&nbsp; Pulling him towards her, she slowly pushed back onto her haunches.&nbsp; Kurt felt ripples of ecstasy coursing through her.&nbsp; A minute passed�more.&nbsp; Finally Kat opened her eyes and her breathing slowly began to return to normal.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Oh God, Kurt!&nbsp; God!&nbsp; I&#8217;ve�never&#8212;not like that.&nbsp; My God.&nbsp; Fucking Jesus.� She reached out and splayed a hand across his wet face.&nbsp; In her eyes, Kurt saw Kat make a decision of some kind but she didn&#8217;t say what.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Kat drove them to Alex&#8217;s, the breakfast caf� they&#8217;d been coming to since as long as Kurt could remember.&nbsp; The thick leather collar felt hot and heavy around his neck; a great mental weight attached to it.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The Hostess knew them by site and smiled warmly when they walked in.&nbsp; With a quick hello she led the way to their usual table.&nbsp; She took a quick glance at Kurt&#8217;s collar but said absolutely nothing.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Eventually Candy wandered over and welcomed them back like usual.&nbsp; Coffee with two creams, coffee black with a tiny tiny bit of sugar which she always let Kurt put in on his own.&nbsp; She looked at them both for confirmation and Kat smiled jovially and agreed.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Kat glanced through the menu.&nbsp; When Kurt reached for his she distractedly reached over and pulled it out of his hands, closed it and set it on the table for Candy to pick up.&nbsp; �You&#8217;re having poached eggs on toast because I want one,� she told him. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Candy came back.&nbsp; The hostess had obviously flagged her down because she stared at Kurt&#8217;s collar with undisguised interest.&nbsp; �So what are we having guys?�&nbsp; Kurt enjoyed how she included herself in their decisions most Sundays.&nbsp; It was something that vaguely annoyed Kat.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I&#8217;m having the two egg omelet with the fruit salad and Kurt&#8217;s having the poached eggs on toast,� Kat told her.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Candy turned to Kurt.&nbsp; �What kind of bread sweetie?�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Kurt looked to Kat and waited for her answer but it didn&#8217;t come.&nbsp; Instead she smiled sweetly at him across the table.&nbsp; Candy began to look confused. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Kurt?&nbsp; Earth to Kurt?&nbsp; Bread?� she laughed, sure he was playing some kind of game.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Finally Kurt broke down.&nbsp; �Can I tell her?� he asked Kat irritably.&nbsp; Kat raised an icy eyebrow in return.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I mean, can I talk to Candy please,� he mumbled.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Go right ahead,� Kat said sweetly, gesturing to their regular waitress.&nbsp; He turned to answer her and stopped. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Um��&nbsp; Kat waited a beat.&nbsp; �Um, what kind of toast should I get?� Kurt asked her.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�He&#8217;ll have whole wheat,� Kat told Candy the waitress.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Uh, okay,� she said, quickly scooping up the menus and disappearing.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Great,� Kurt whispered, �now we&#8217;ve weirded everyone out.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�When we get home I&#8217;m going to crop you twice on each ass cheek for that,� Kat said sweetly, crossing her legs. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Mistress for what?� Kurt whined.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Four.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Oh for&#8212;oh.&nbsp; I&#8217;m sorry.&nbsp; May I speak Mistress Kat?�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Kat smiled.&nbsp; �No.&nbsp; Just sit there quietly until the food comes.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Kurt did.&nbsp; Candy brought their meals with the other regular server and the hostess hovering nearby, ears straining.&nbsp; She couldn&#8217;t bring herself to ask questions though.&nbsp; Kat thanked her profusely and shared a quick laugh with her about something pointless and she scurried off.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Kurt looked down at his food and up at his Mistress.&nbsp; �May I eat Mistress?�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Kat mulled it over.&nbsp; �Save me one; the best one, and yes you can slave.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Kurt pushed the eggs around on his plate, selected out the biggest and tastiest looking and lifted it between his fork and his thumb across the table divide onto Kat&#8217;s plate.&nbsp; She said nothing, simply shuffled her omelet aside to make room.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�So uh, can we like�talk?&nbsp; Like usual?&nbsp; Mistress?� Kurt asked.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She lifted her head to regard him, smiling sweetly.&nbsp; �Sure slave.&nbsp; What did you want to talk about?�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Well, um, oh, I found that CD by the way.&nbsp; So you don&#8217;t have to keep looking for it for me,� Kurt told her.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Kat sighed theatrically.&nbsp; �Well shit!&nbsp; I got it for you for Christmas.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�What seriously?�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�No not really,� Kat chuckled to herself.&nbsp; �Where did you find it anyway?�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�On-line.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;They fell easily into their usual inane banter like two old friends.&nbsp; Candy the server stood nearby confused and reported back what she&#8217;d heard.&nbsp; They were just talking like normal&#8212;their usual pointless nattering about stuff.&nbsp; Kat finished her omelet and slowly picked apart the poached egg on toast Kurt had given her but didn&#8217;t eat it.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Full?� he asked.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Changed my mind,� she told him curtly.&nbsp; Then slowly, deliberately she bent over her plate, puckered her lips, and spit audibly over the decimated poached egg.&nbsp; Kurt looked around panicked to see if anyone had seen.&nbsp; Candy clearly had.&nbsp; Her mouth hung in a small &#8216;o&#8217; of shock and disgust; her eyes practically bugged out of her head.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Eat it,� Kat ordered him.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Kurt looked up at her, shocked and directionless.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Don&#8217;t make me shove your face in it slave,� she whispered&#8212;loudly.&nbsp; More of a hiss between her teeth really.&nbsp; Kurt nodded his understanding.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Yes Mistress.�&nbsp; Slowly he picked up his fork again, looked at it like it might give him some answers, and dutifully scooped the egg into his mouth.&nbsp; Their waitress and the hostess quietly looked on.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When he&#8217;d finished Kat smiled benignly.&nbsp; �All done?� she asked.&nbsp; Kurt nodded.&nbsp; �Ready to go?�&nbsp; He nodded again.&nbsp; She stood up and got her coat on.&nbsp; Kurt slowly slid his chair back.&nbsp; Kat slid to the front counter and paid their bill, handing her credit card to the unbelieving hostess.&nbsp; Kurt fumbled with his coat before finally succeeding in getting his arms through the sleeves.&nbsp; Kat was already waiting for him by the door impatiently.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As Kurt hauled his ass lethargically across the restaurant towards the door Kat turned jauntily to Candy and said:&nbsp; �If he doesn&#8217;t get his ass moving I&#8217;m not going to wait &#8216;till we get home to spank him.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Kurt nearly lost consciousness.&nbsp; His face drained of all blood, his teeth chattered.&nbsp; Little wisps of something flitted behind his eyes.&nbsp; In every year of his entire life he&#8217;d never been more absolutely mortified.&nbsp; He prayed for a stroke to take him quickly.&nbsp; Still, his feet carried him quickly to Kat&#8217;s side.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Candy ran up behind the counter.&nbsp; �Um, hey come again guys.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�We will, don&#8217;t worry,� Kat assured her. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Um, were you guys like always�� she gestured between Kurt and Kat with her finger like it should be self explanatory.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Kat shook her head; her bouncy hair flew saucily.&nbsp; �Oh this?&nbsp; No.&nbsp; Not at all.&nbsp; This is totally new.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She waved goodbye to the restaurant staff, took Kurt&#8217;s hand tightly and led them out.&nbsp; �You were very good in there,� she said lightly, like discussing bowling. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Uh, thank you Mistress Kat.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I would have pushed your face in the eggs,� she told him seriously.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I know Mistress.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She drove them back to her house, something new for both of them.&nbsp; Kurt usually arrived for brunch in his own car, and went home his own way.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For the rest of the day Kurt held his proverbial breath.&nbsp; Kat was gracious and generous.&nbsp; She sat reading a magazine for an hour on the couch, dressed comfortably in her usual jeans and a sweater.&nbsp; She rested her bare feet comfortably on Kurt&#8217;s arched back.&nbsp; She flicked on the TV and let Kurt massage her feet.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;After that Kat put together some kind of pasta dish that Kurt had never had before.&nbsp; She even let him eat with her at the table.&nbsp; Kurt ate silently, filling his stomach, not giving Kat the provocation to spit in, piss on or otherwise defile his meal.&nbsp; He automatically cleaned up the dishes.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Evening pulled up outside.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Kat slipped up behind him while his hands were letting the dish water out of the sink.&nbsp; She wrapped her manicured fingers around Kurt&#8217;s naked and loose cock, stroking it gently.&nbsp; With unbridled speed it sprung to attention.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Time to talk,� she whispered.&nbsp; �When you&#8217;re done come into the living room.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She was waiting for him, her feet tucked underneath her.&nbsp; It was a sight Kurt had seen so many times before.&nbsp; Instead of flopping himself in the armchair though and blurting out his usual &#8216;what&#8217;s up?&#8217;, he crawled to her feet and silently waited on his knees, his eyes cast down to the carpet.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Without inviting him to get more equally comfortable Kat started talking to him. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�So it&#8217;s that time now�by the way.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Mistress?�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Sunday night.&nbsp; You&#8217;ve gotta work tomorrow; I&#8217;ve got appointments.&nbsp; Shit to do right.�&nbsp; Kurt was silent.&nbsp; �Back to normal,� Kat clarified.&nbsp; She touched her fingers to the back of Kurt&#8217;s collar.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Mistress, may I speak?� he asked.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Yes slave.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Mistress Kat, I don&#8217;t want to take off my collar.&nbsp; I�I want�please&#8212;I mean, I want to keep being your slave.&nbsp; Please let me stay your slave,� Kurt stammered. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Kat wordlessly slid down to the carpet to face Kurt head on.&nbsp; She entwined her fingers with his hair and covered his lips with her own, pulling the air from his mouth, kissing him deeply.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Oh Kurty, I&#8217;m, I&#8217;m so glad&#8212;I needed to hear it from you.&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; Yes, yes you&#8217;re mine slave.�&nbsp; She leaned in to his ear and whispered: �I&#8217;ll tell you a little secret.&nbsp; I wasn&#8217;t going to let you go no matter what.�

&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
