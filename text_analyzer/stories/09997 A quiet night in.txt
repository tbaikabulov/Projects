A quiet night in
by timidbruin

As I sit locked in my box with little possibility of changing my situation, I could not help but begin to wonder where it had all gone wrong.&nbsp; Or right.&nbsp; It all depends upon your point of view, and even with the hood and gag in place I still tired to smile.

It was nothing but a usual busy Friday afternoon of meetings, reports and the usual sifting through bullshit.&nbsp; During a moment between problem solving I was pleasantly surprised with a phone call from my wife.

�Hey honey, how is your day going?�&nbsp; She asked in the most innocent of voices.
�Urgh, it just never ends.&nbsp; Just when I think I might get on top of it all, something else jumps up and smacks me again.�
�I'm sorry to hear that, are you still going to make it home for dinner?&nbsp; I want to make you something nice, how does some home-made stew sound to you?.�
�Sure, sounds great, I promise I'll make it home for dinner.&nbsp; Once I can get away from here I don't want to see anyone again.&nbsp; Just us for the weekend, some good quality quiet time together.�
�I think that can be arranged.�&nbsp; I could hear the smile in her voice, the only problem was I didn't sense the cheeky tone.

The rest of the work day was uneventful, I plugged away finishing what I could and postponing everything else to the following week.&nbsp; All I wanted was to punch out from the monotony and get home to have a quiet peaceful meal at home with my lovely wife.&nbsp; I nearly made it, being left with a couple of hours worth of work still to be finished off, I figured it would be safe to take it with me and somehow squeeze it in when I had unwound.

The trip home was uneventful, just the usual busy traffic amongst other bored drivers wanting to find their quiet little place in the world.&nbsp; Getting home I parked the car in the garage and walked around to the front door, still without the slightest of ideas of what was in store.&nbsp; My key slide effortlessly into the door to unlock a night I would never forget.

Having heard me pull into the drive, she was in the hall waiting for me.&nbsp; Strategically standing just forward of the hallway down-light, her chestnut brown hair flowing all the way down to her waist, surrounded by a enlightened halo giving an angelic appearance.&nbsp; She was only half dressed, nothing but knee high English riding boots and some tight fitting two tone jodhpurs, her long locks teasing what lay beneath as they sat covering her perk breasts.&nbsp; The unexpected view took my breath from me, half out of surprise, half from shock.&nbsp; She knew it was the way I fantasised most about her, and no effort had been spared.&nbsp; 

In her left hand was a riding crop, in her right a collar.&nbsp; My collar.&nbsp; Giving me a few moments she stood there, her beauty stunning me to do nothing but stand in the doorway with my jaw dropped.&nbsp; Slowly holding out my collar she spoke in a soft tone �If you want more, your going to have to wear this.�&nbsp; We had always agreed that for a session I would consent by putting on my collar, this way we both felt comfortable with a firm starting point.

I took a step inside swinging the door shut behind me, I dropped my briefcase by the wall and fell to my knees a respectful distance from her feet.&nbsp; My head pointed down to the ground I slowly lifted my eyes, savouring her highly polished black leather boots, to the jodhpurs tightly conforming to her skin.&nbsp; The darker brown of the jodhpurs highlighting her inner thighs while the lighter tan of the outer fabric showing off the beauty of her natural curves.&nbsp; My eyes drifting up over her soft skin and contours as they took in all that I loved about her, eventually meeting with her eyes, wanting me to take the journey she was offering.

I reached up to her outstretched hand and took my collar.&nbsp; As I buckled the well worn leather collar around my neck I could feel the comfort of an item that I have come to love and loath at times.&nbsp; It was my freedom, but only in the binding did it give me that promised inner freedom.

�Good boy, I'm proud of you.�&nbsp; She said, with that same gentle and warm voice I had come to know.&nbsp; I looked back up to her as she reached around behind her to grab something that was tucked into the back of her jodhpurs.&nbsp; Seductively stepping around me so that I could not see what was in her other hand, she moved beside and a little behind me.&nbsp; I started to follow her with my eyes, but the further she went I soon had to turn my head to follow her.&nbsp; I then felt the force of the riding crop across my back.&nbsp; �No, you just stay there and be still, I want to see what I have to work with.� 

Continuing around me she reappeared in front, my eyes moving to track her, but I dare not move for another whip.&nbsp; Her hand was now concealing something small that she held against her body.&nbsp; Studying me up and down there seemed to be a sign of approval across her face, one of both wanting and also an evil side that wanted what I may not give.&nbsp; It was all part of her play, she loved the control, and the moment that I put my collar on, it was all hers.

Continuing her circle she passed from my field of view once more, the temptation to follow was there as strong as ever but I knew my place and she had plans.&nbsp; I heard the click of her boots on the hard wood floor stop behind me, I could hear her breathing, and from my memory I could see the smile of delight lighting up her face.&nbsp; There was a gentle tug on my collar as she squeezed her fingers down against my neck and tested my binding, it ending with the sound of a click.&nbsp; She had been holding a padlock and now used it to lock my collar in place, I now knew this was not going to be a short tease, but a long night ahead.

I felt her move in closer, her breath on the back of my ear.&nbsp; �Your mine now, so don't you move an inch.� she said whispering.&nbsp; Stepping back she opened the draw on a small antique table by the door.&nbsp; I heard the familiar clinking of metal on metal followed by the sound of a handcuff ratchet being opened ready for its victim.&nbsp; She gently took one of my hands and secured the cuff in place, softly guiding it around to the small of my back.&nbsp; She then took the other hand and unlike the first, folded my hand into a pressure point and forced my arm to meet the other, pinning both together.&nbsp; Unexpected pain from my wrist jolted me forward, she held the grip firmly until she had both hands cuffed, palms out.&nbsp; My breath was a little taken by the unexpected harshness, but she did like to show who's the boss.

I straightened back to my original kneeling stance, hands now locked behind me.&nbsp; I still not dare turn as I strained to listen and interpret my fate.&nbsp; Her boots gave her away with a few steps back towards the front door.&nbsp; Hearing the door open once more I could not help but wonder what was going on.&nbsp; Of all the things I though she was planning, that was one I hadn't thought of.&nbsp; Feeling her eyes upon me I knew that turning to look would only result in some form of punishment.&nbsp; I resisted for as long as I could, but the curiosity eventually got the better of me. 

Cautiously turning to the right I waited for the crop to find its way onto my back.&nbsp; It never came.&nbsp; She was standing in the open doorway I had only just passed through a few minutes ago as a free man.&nbsp; She pointed to the keys still hanging in the door-lock, my keys, the keys I had forgotten about once I laid eyes on her.

�Tsk Tsk, this is going to cost you.&nbsp; We can't just have anyone just walking in here you know.�
�But I.....�&nbsp; 
She cut me off, �No, there is no 'but'.�
�Sorry Mistress�
�Oh don't worry there will be time for that, for now you will remain quiet.�

With that she quickly stepped forward, and whipped my arse hard with the crop.&nbsp; I couldn't turn fast enough, getting back to the 'safe' forward position again.&nbsp; Even through my trousers and boxers, the whip felt like it was enough to leave a mark.&nbsp; Letting out a little wince, I found my correct position, eyes forward, arms relaxed and my mouth shut.

Closing the door, she went back to the draw where the cuffs had been hidden and took out my leash.&nbsp; It was a metal chain style, which if used for walking a dog wasn't so great but for me it was, it was both weighty and could be varied in length.&nbsp; She clipped one end to the D ring fixed on the front of my collar and proceed&nbsp; to walk down the hall towards the bedroom.&nbsp; As she moved she took up some of the slack on the leash and motioned a tug, I knew to follow.&nbsp; Scrambling to my feet so as not to pull back on the lead, which could only be interpreted as disobedience, I stumbled up and followed in step as she lead me to the bedroom.

As she walked she held the handle of the leash low by her side, allowing me to feel the full weight of the chain leash on my neck.&nbsp; I kept stride with her, the sound of my dress shoes drowned out by the tap of her riding boots.&nbsp; Flicking the bedroom light on I expected to find something out of place for a possible scene she had been planning, but it was all as it should be.&nbsp; The bed was made and clear of items except the usual extra pillows.&nbsp; The dresser had the normal items atop it, all clean and tidy as she liked to keep it, and the dog cage in the corner.&nbsp; Not that we had a dog, it was just a good place for her to keep me when she was preparing things.&nbsp; There was also a large chest next to the wall that had a lock on it so we could put away the toys and equipment that we didn't want anyone else to see.

Leading me to the end of the bed she tied her end of the leash to the metal frame of the bed-end.&nbsp; Turning towards me she gave me one of her special smiles, one that I only got when she was in complete control.&nbsp; I knew she was loving this, giving what she knew I loved, yet was often to afraid to ask for.&nbsp; Again she slowly made her way behind me, the lesson learnt I did not move, I had to prove I was worth the lessons she gave.&nbsp; 

I felt her move in close, her body pressing gently against mine, as she wrapped her arms around my waist.&nbsp; Slowly she began to rub against me, feeling me through my shirt and methodically moving her hands further down.&nbsp; I felt her begin to feel my hardened cock through my trousers, it having only awoken from its day once I laid eyes upon her and now being smothered by the confinement of my boxers.&nbsp; I stretched my head back a little taking in a large breath, wanting to turn and take her in my arms, yet the cuffs reminding me that was not an option.&nbsp; Giving my member a playful squeeze she whispered once more to my ear.&nbsp; 

�Tough day was it?&nbsp; I bet you can't even remember what you were doing an hour ago.&nbsp; And this is only the beginning.&nbsp; You had better leave all that behind, I expect all of your attention now.�&nbsp; She gripped harder, making sure she also got a good handful of my balls too.&nbsp; �These are mine for the night, and I will do what I want with them.�

I winced as she held on, but managed to limit any movement on my part.&nbsp; Releasing her grip she effortlessly switched back to the playful rubbing, driving my mind back from pain and into the bliss of the sensation.&nbsp; Her lips kissing my shoulder as her hands began to work their way out onto my thighs, continuing the motions of pleasure, but not getting me too over excited.&nbsp; Moving down my legs with her hands her lips began kissing their own path down my spine, her soft touching kisses working their way through the thin fabric of my shirt.&nbsp; With my wrists cuffed she soon reached them with her sensual lips, her warm hands now passed my knees.&nbsp; 

I stood still, every fibre of my being just wanting to let her do anything she pleased.&nbsp; Her left hand let go and disappeared behind me, just as her lips left me for the last time.&nbsp; Her right hand now found its place just above my ankle and I felt her left hand slipping up against the right side of my waist.&nbsp; As she gently pressed against me, my mind taken I let my weight move to the left with the guided hand.&nbsp; Without any warning she then pulled my ankle out from under me lifting my foot up against my arse and all of my weight was forced onto my left leg.&nbsp; She held firm as I wobbled about, not balancing me, but restricting me from dropping back down to two feet.&nbsp; She then proceeded to untie my shoe laces upside down, just like a farrier working on a horse's hoof.&nbsp; The shoe came off, followed closely by my sock, I dreaded the fact I had no idea this was coming, I had just spent all day in those and wished I could have cleaned up a little first.

The relaxation now gone I struggled to stay as steady as possible balancing on the one leg.&nbsp; Just as I had been slipping away to never-land at her magical touch, she had taken it away again and gave me something else to think about.&nbsp; Balancing was not a hard thing to do in normal circumstances, but on the brink of complete bliss and mindlessness, I know found it took all of my concentration.&nbsp; She held on for a minute or two as she played with my toes, it was hard for me to judge time, then she released my foot back to the ground.&nbsp; Reversing her grip over to my left leg I let her take my other foot, just as a farrier would expect of the horse they was servicing.

My shoes and socks now in a pile on the floor she went about the business of unbuckling my belt.&nbsp; Slipping it slowly through the loops of my trousers I could feel the tail of the belt as it loosened my trousers to the point they wanted to drop.&nbsp; With a little tug that&#8217;s exactly what they did, ending as a rumpled pile of fabric around my bare feet.

Still unwilling to turn or even move for fear of a reprisal, I stood perfectly still letting her play out her plans of my ultimate tease.&nbsp; With a little tug on either leg of my boxers they soon followed the same fate as my trousers.&nbsp; I now stood in the middle of the bedroom, hands cuffed behind, collar and leash tied to the bed-end, and with nothing to cover my modesty but the lower hem of my business shirt.

I know knew that she had forgotten one thing, she would have to take off the cuffs if she wanted to get the shirt off.&nbsp; It wasn't like her to miss a detail like that, but there we had it.&nbsp; I knew she wouldn't cut it off as it was part of the gift she gave me when I received my last promotion.&nbsp; I let out a small smile, wondering how she would pull this off.

I could sense the heat before she made any contact, but there was little I could, or would, do to defend myself.&nbsp; Her right hand came up between my legs from behind and securely grabbed my balls.&nbsp; She gave a good tight squeeze that immediately wiped the smile from me.&nbsp; The pain grew as she didn't let up on the pressure.&nbsp; It took my breath, it took my thoughts, it made me want to do anything for her.

�Having some of your own thoughts there are we?�

My mind raced trying to work out how she knew, then as quick as flicking on the lights, I realised that she had seen me smile in the mirror on the dresser.&nbsp; I hadn't realised until now that she had positioned me so that it was just out of my line of sight and knowing that I wouldn't turn my head, she could safely watch me from the side without me seeing. 

�Did you really just think that I hadn't thought of your shirt?&nbsp; Hmmm, now that is interesting.�

Letting go of her empowering grip, she went to the dresser to get the next step of her plan.&nbsp; Leaving it on the floor behind me, I listened for the sound of metal, leather of the distinct squeak of something rubber.&nbsp; There was nothing to give me any clues as to what it was she planned, and that in itself was the plan.

Again she moved up close behind me, her arms wrapping around my shoulders as her fingers found their way to my top shirt button.&nbsp; As she slowly worked her way down I could feel her long locks teasing my bound hands.&nbsp; Eventually the last of my buttons felt a freedom of its own, then she took both sides of the shirt and pulled it back over my shoulders.&nbsp; Sliding the shirt down to my wrists she hit the wall I was expecting.&nbsp; She would now have to undo the cuffs and let me regain some movement, and not too soon, with my arms back I was beginning to stiffen up with a lack of movement.

She then picked up the rope she had placed on the floor behind me.&nbsp; Working on my arms at the elbows she wrapped and clinched my arms until they were firmly held together.&nbsp; She pull the handcuff key from the jewellery box atop the dresser and removed the cuffs.&nbsp; I was more restricted than before, and now she had the shirt off.&nbsp; I tested my movement but there was little difference, she had come along way in her rope-work.

�Don't worry, you're going to get your arms back in a minute, I'm not that cruel, we can't have you just standing there all night.�

She went back to the dresser and took out another item.

�Now down on your knees and head to the floor.&nbsp; I want to see that arse nice and high.�&nbsp; 

I did as well as I could, dropping to my knees immediately, but with my arms bound back hesitated to drop forward.&nbsp; Seeing this hesitation, she helped out with a gentle nudge from her riding boot.&nbsp; I came crashing to the ground face first, the plush carpet offering little to soften the fall.&nbsp; Spreading my legs a little for some much needed comfort, I lifted my arse as high as possible, presenting whatever it was she was looking for.

�See that wasn't so hard, although next time you hesitate I'll help you a little more.�&nbsp; 

With no hesitation on her part she took what she was after, and grabbed my scrotum pulling back much further than it was ever designed for.&nbsp; She then clamped my balls into a humbler, like a medieval stockade except this device locked around the balls and continued out behind the arse stopped a male from being able to stand.&nbsp; She locked the clasp on the humbler and finished with a small padlock.&nbsp; My cock was now bursting at length and beginning to leak, showing her my uncontrollable desire for what was happening.

�Oh you like that, good, get comfortable in it.�

I wanted nothing more than to tell her the feelings I was having, but it wasn't how this worked.&nbsp; My cock was on fire, and the discomfort of my balls only added to the frustration, I was lost in a world of her creation.&nbsp; My arms and shoulders ached, balls stretched to their maximum, my face full of carpet, and yet all I wanted was some touch and relief for my cock, and that now just hung in the air completely unfulfilled.&nbsp; Snapping me back to the present, she gave me a harsh flick to my balls with her finger.&nbsp; Being strained to the tightness of a drum the flick travel the full length of my body, follow by a full body shiver, the aftershock following an earthquake.

She went once more to the dresser, and took out another item for me.&nbsp; This time when she returned she straddled herself across my arse letting my upper legs take her full weight.&nbsp; My hands still with a small amount of freedom, now only a fraction of an inch from her crotch, yet they may as well have been a world away from it.&nbsp; The sensation of feeling her jodhpurs across my arse, only a small layer of fabric keeping us apart, sent my mind into a spiral.&nbsp; She wriggled about, making out that she was making herself more comfortable, but I knew it was for my benefit there was nothing I wanted more than her wearing those.

She lifted my arms, pulling them up from my back almost to a point straight up.&nbsp; I wasn't the most flexible person, but she did have a good idea of how far she could push before the pain became too much.&nbsp; This was close to my limit and I began to groan at the angle.&nbsp; She took one of my hands and forced me to make a fist.&nbsp; With the current position that she had me, I did as she wanted and she slipped a mitt over my fist, and locked it around my wrist.&nbsp; I tried and failed to stretch my fingers inside the mitt, but it was more for a sense of finding my new limitations.&nbsp; I had my other hand already in a fist and she slipped the second mitt on, locking it too with a small padlock.

�Good boy,� she said letting my arms back down to rest on my back.&nbsp; Sliding herself forward a bit she bumped her crotch against my mitts, knowing that I could feel her there, but it was not the feel that I desired.&nbsp; She then reached back and kindly rubbed my taught balls, reminding me of their current situation in all this.&nbsp; She sat there for a moment, taking in the control that she now had, she had always had it, but she savoured moments like this to take it all in.

�Ok, I'm very pleased with you.&nbsp; Even though there have been some little mistakes, overall you're doing well, I guess perfect will have to wait for another night.&nbsp; For now, I need to go finish making dinner, so we'll have to do something about you.�

She pulled my arms back up, but nowhere as high as before and started undoing the rope binding my elbows together.&nbsp; As she took off the the rope layers, I could feel the blood beginning to rush back through to my hands, only for the cramped mitts to block the feeling in my fingers.&nbsp; As the last of the restraint was released, my elbows feel apart and my arms back to my sides as my mitts hit the floor.

Standing straight up over me, she gave a squeeze of her legs to my hips, a welcome reminder of her dominance.&nbsp; Reaching forward she took the lead off the bed-end and stepped off me to the side.&nbsp; �Here boy,� she called as she lead me over to the dog cage.&nbsp; On all fours I did the best I could with the mitts and the humbler slowing me down.&nbsp; Opening the door I turned and backed into the confined crate so that she could unhook the leash from my collar.&nbsp; She closed the door and locked a large padlock over the latch.

�Stay.� she commanded with a smile.

She turned and left room, switching off the lights and closing the door as she went.&nbsp; I listened to her boots on the hardwood floor in the hall wishing for her return, and knowing it would only take time.

The cage wasn't very big, I couldn't really lay down, or even stretch out in any direction, it was why I had backed in, there was no way I could even turn around should she command it.&nbsp; But it was as comfortable as a cage could be, she was kind enough to give me a thin blanket to sit on while I awaited her return.&nbsp; The cage itself kept me doubled over and hunched down, the humbler doubling that restraint.&nbsp; 

I could still feel the constant pressure of the humbler on my balls, keeping them stretched out behind my legs.&nbsp; At least now being doubled over with my legs up against my stomach it relived the humbler and the pressure as much as was possible, but it did still pull my cock back and pointing down.&nbsp; 

Left to my own thoughts, I couldn't help but feel the draw of my teased and currently unused cock.&nbsp; It felt strained between my legs, a frustration that she had teased and deliberately left without any relief that it deserved.&nbsp; The warmth of desire had grown between my legs and I had to try to find my own release.&nbsp; Spreading my knees as far as my cage walls would allow and arching my back up against the ceiling of the cage I tried to grab a hold of myself.&nbsp; It was in vain, the mitts bound to my wrists quenched any attempt on my behalf to get any purchase on my burning cock.&nbsp; Fumbling about I tried with my right hand and again with my left, even pushing my face against the thick wire mesh and using both mitts gave no satisfaction.&nbsp; Frustration built as I wiggled about trying to find some kind of purchase, anything for a little release of this cruellest of cruel denials.&nbsp; Each time I felt I was close to succeeding my covered fists gave nothing in return.

In the darkness of the room I could only feel the confines for the cage against my skin as I rattled about trying as best I could to use two useless hands for a task they could not do.&nbsp; Everything slowly slipped away into the jet black of my confinement, my whole world reduced to a 2 and a half by 3 and a half foot cube.&nbsp; There was nothing else, no room, no house, all that I knew right now was my Mistress would return when she was ready and the futility of my frustrated struggle.&nbsp; I wanted nothing more than to grab my throbbing cock and fire a load off, but no matter the want, I had no means.&nbsp; My fate for the night had be chosen, and she had chosen well.

I struggled with myself for a long time, but ended up giving in to my frustration and finding the least uncomfortable position within my limitations.&nbsp; Naked except for my collar, some infuriating leather mitts and a humbler tormenting my manhood, I now accepted my fate within the darkness.&nbsp; As strange as it may look to anyone who didn't understand, I wouldn't have changed a thing.

With no light in the room I had no means of measuring the time, and I longed for her.&nbsp; I could handle the aches and pains, even the frustration of not being able to please myself, but I wanted to at least see her.&nbsp; I didn't even want to be let out, I just wanted more contact from her, her commands, her demeanour, her smile, even her punishment.&nbsp; I knew not to call out, not to 'rattle the cage' but to sit and wait, she was doing this for us, not just me.&nbsp; I closed my eyes and my breathing slowed, without any outside stimulation I was slipping into an almost standby state of mind.&nbsp; The world now long gone and only one person that everything hinged on, I waited.

I never heard her boots on the hardwood, whether she snuck up to the door or I was gone so far as not to hear it, my sub-space was blown as she opened the door and hit the lights.&nbsp; Had it not been for the well made cage I know I would have leapt up, even with the humbler still in place.&nbsp; The light burning my eyes as they struggle to adjust to the brightness, but I couldn't look away from the angelic mistress before me.

�Awww, had a little nap did we?&nbsp; You're so cute in there,� she said with a smile.&nbsp; �But dinner is ready, common lets have some food.�

She grabbed the key from her jewellery box and unlocked the crate.&nbsp; Grabbing the leash that she had left atop the crate, she undid the latch and opened the door.&nbsp; I waited for her to reattached my leash and then crawled out on all my aching limbs.&nbsp; Once clear of the cage I gave each limb a good stretch and flex as best I could with the humbler still in place.&nbsp; She curiously watched me as an owner watches a dog rise from a good afternoon nap waiting for me to give her my full attention once more.

�Hungry?� she asked, knowing that I would only ever give one answer.&nbsp; I gave a little nod with a smile as I looked longingly into her eyes from my position on all fours at her feet.&nbsp; Smiling back she turned and lead me to the door.&nbsp; �Good boy, come.�

We made our way through the hallway to the other end of the house.&nbsp; Her boots tapping away at the floor, and my eyes fixed to them as I scurried along on all four behind.&nbsp; At first I didn't notice the changes she had made to the dinning room, I just sat back on my haunches when she gave me a hand signal.&nbsp; She had already trained me as a human pup, I now followed those commands just as easily as a verbal instruction.

I watched her delicious curves as she moved around the room, lighting some thin candles on the table and putting some finished touches in preparation for our dinner.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As she left my sight and disappeared into the kitchen I finally looked around the room itself.&nbsp; Most was as normal, except for a few minor changes.&nbsp; She had removed all of the dining chairs except for one at the head of the table, and there was now a thin cheap rug under the length of the table covering the plush carpet I now sat on.&nbsp; She walked back in and signalled me to come, I rushed over on hands and knees as fast as the humbler would allow.&nbsp; Sitting before her, she reached down and gathered up my leash now hanging from my collar.&nbsp; Unhooking the clasp she took the leash away and placed it on a nearby side table.&nbsp; 

�This is a special dinner I made for you, and as such you must dress appropriately.�&nbsp; With that she reached back to the side table and brought down a bow tie, but this was not like any bow-tie I had seen before.&nbsp; This one was like a clip-on bow-tie, except it didn't have a band to go all the way around the wearers neck.&nbsp; This special bow-tie just had two very short pieces of elastic and a hook at each end of them.&nbsp; She knelt down in front of me as I did my best to present my neck for her, straining to be the perfect submissive.&nbsp; Hooking one of the elastics to the D ring on one side of my collar she then pulled it taught around the front and hooked the other end to the opposing D ring on my other side.&nbsp; Stepping back to admire her handiwork, she signalled me to stay perfectly still as she pulled a camera off the side table and snapped a shot for our private collection.

Placing the camera back onto the side table she disappeared back into the kitchen.&nbsp; I sat perfectly still holding the best puppy position that I could manage as she returned.&nbsp; In her hand she carried a shiny steel dog dish, steam rose from it, and the aroma assaulted my nose.&nbsp; She wafted the bowl down under my nose letting me get a good sniff of the offering, motioning me to follow, she placed the dish under the table right in front of the one chair.&nbsp; I crawled under the table being positioned perfectly by her gentle guiding hand.&nbsp; My head dipped as I wanted another sniff of my special home-made stew, only to be met with a swift smack on the nose.

�No.&nbsp; Wait,� She promptly ordered.&nbsp; Heading once more to the kitchen she came back with a bottle of red wine and a small bowl of food for herself.&nbsp; Only being able to see her boots from my spot under the table she poured some wine into her glass and some more into a small steel bowl that she then put onto the floor next to my dinner.&nbsp; Taking her seat at the head of the table she placed a boot to either side of my now perfect dinner.

�You may now begin.�

Crouching down on my bound paws, I dove straight into the heart-warming dinner that she had specially prepared for me.&nbsp; I savoured the taste of the meal, not only chosen for the taste of a good healthy meal, but also as it also represented a meal you would feed a good puppy.&nbsp; I knew I was making a mess of my face, but it was all worth it, and I did my best to make the most of such an opportunity.&nbsp; In between mouthfuls of stew, I occasionally wet my palette with the wine and savoured the view of both eating between her feet and looking up to the conforming two-toned jodhpurs above.&nbsp; I had spent the afternoon looking forward to this meal, but never in my dreams had I pictured something as perfect as this.

As I got close to the bottom of my bowl I felt it start to shift against my attempts to get the last scraps.&nbsp; Not looking, yet still well aware of my position, she sensed my problem and clamped the steel bowl between her feet.&nbsp; With the dish held steady, and her boots ever so much closer and tighter into my personal space, I savoured the last few mouthfuls and made sure to lick the entire bowl spotlessly clean.&nbsp; I then set about licking clean the boots from any splatter that I caused during the meal.&nbsp; Being as thorough as possible, both out of wanting to do well and not ever wanting to stop, it became evident that I had finished.&nbsp; I sat back onto my haunches as best I could without bumping the table above me as she slid her chair back to take a look at me.

�Good boy, you finished it all up.&nbsp; You have done so well, I'll even give you a little treat for dessert later on,� she said through a pleased smile.&nbsp; �But for now, I think we had better clean you up, you have half your dinner all over your chin.�&nbsp; She reached over and took a napkin from the table and proceeded to wipe all the mess from my chin as I held my head between her knees, once done she threw the used napkin into my bowl.

She motioned me out from under the table as she stood and went to get my leash from the side table.&nbsp; Taking off the bow-tie, she placed it on the table and reattached my leash for the walk back to the bedroom.&nbsp; My belly sloshed from side to side as we made our way back up the house, the humbler still limiting me to all fours.&nbsp; Once in the bedroom she motioned me with pup sign-language to present my arse for her.&nbsp; I dropped only my forearms with my head to the ground and held my arse as high as possible.&nbsp; 

She unlocked the humbler and my balls snapped back to their natural position, their punishment over for the time being.&nbsp; She then took my bound paws, once again handcuffing them behind my back as they were earlier, and removed the mitts.&nbsp; I felt the blood rushing back to both my balls and my fingers as they were now free and once more my own.

�Sit,� she commanded in a sturdy voice.&nbsp; I sat back up to a kneeling position once more awaiting further instructions already feeling the benefits of the humbler being removed.&nbsp; She circled me once more, my head staying locked straight forward to a point in space I could only imagine.&nbsp; Stopping directly at my left she also faced my point in space.&nbsp; Slowly but surely she stepped her right foot in front of my folded knees.&nbsp; With a woman's grace she gently pushed back into my knees giving me no option but to split my legs giving her access to where she wanted to go.&nbsp; Feeling the leather of the boot against my inner thighs she continued pushing back parting her way to my groin with her heal.&nbsp; The back of her finely sculptured leg now taught with the soft fabric of her jodhpurs pressed against my front, from belly to my face.&nbsp; With a little force she pushed her heal up into my groin, squashing what she found there.

�Hold my boot for me.�

Leather boot firmly lodged into my most private of privates, I squeezed my legs trapping the boot with my upper thighs. She pulled up and I felt the slip of her heal inside the boot.&nbsp; Seductively she took her time pulling her foot from the boot, even pulling up on the boot a little, making me tighten my grip further. Once free of the leather she stepped over me and placed her now bare foot to my right straddling my folded legs and placing her finely toned arse an inch from my face.

Slowly she bent forward doubling herself over to retrieve the boot from my groin in preparation for the next one.&nbsp; As she bent over, she naturally pressed her arse back into my face, at first I moved back to avoid her, but realised that she was offing it.&nbsp; I stood my ground and let her smother my face, breathing deep I could smell her moist womanhood under the soft taught fabric.&nbsp; Resisting the urge to kiss her I did as I had been trained and tried to stay neutral to her touch until permission had been given.&nbsp; Holding her position for a moment as she retrieved the boot, I felt my cock straining to find space, eventually she took the boot and I found myself at full mast in the vacated space.

Holding onto her boot she straightened up, giving me fresh air once more, and placed the second boot between my legs for removal.&nbsp; This time she pushed lightly down on my hard cock, trapping it under her heal.&nbsp; Again I squeezed my thighs trapping the boot allowing her to take it off, my cock trapped in a vicious circle of both pain and pleasure.

Once freed she took both boots and placed them together at the end of the bed, my head still spinning of pleasure and desire for her touch.&nbsp; To add to my troubles she came back to stand in front of me giving me another look at her two-toned legs and arse.&nbsp; Hooking both thumbs into the top hem of her jodhpurs she slowly started to slip them down her body.&nbsp; At first she teased as she slowly slipped them down over her finely shaped arse then she began to double over again as she continued to work from side to side, slipping them further down her thighs.&nbsp; With each inch of downward movement her womanhood came more into view, it was now that I could begin to see the moistness and the effect that I had placed on her in my incarceration. This time though she was a few feet away, and there was no hope for me to get the touch I craved.&nbsp; Once at she reached her ankles I had the greatest view I could hope for as she stepped one foot from the jodhpurs then the other.&nbsp; Discarding the used garment onto the bed she turned to see that I was completely taken by her spells and nothing but putty to her.&nbsp; I know now that the smile she gave at that point was not one of tenderness, it was for the evil she was about to unleash.

She circled back around behind me and ordered, �Down.�&nbsp; At first I heard it but did not comprehend the word, it wasn't until her foot hit me hard between the shoulder blades and my face slammed down into the carpet once more that I got the meaning of the command.&nbsp; Hands still bound behind me I had nothing but the carpet to soften the blow.&nbsp; Trying to get the breath back into my lungs I wriggled about on the ground the cuffs doing their job well and not giving me any purchase to right myself.

She then stuck her fingers down the back of my neck and took hold of my collar.&nbsp; Pulling me up to a sitting position again by the neck, I let out a strained cough at the unexpected move.&nbsp; Without letting go of the collar she unhooked the leash with her other hand dropping that to the floor.&nbsp; She then grabbed the handcuffs binding my wrists and forced then higher up my back, intense pain shooting through my arms as they bent to angle they were never meant to achieve.&nbsp; Without so much as a word her body language ordered me up onto my feet.&nbsp; This was the least amount of restraints she had been using since I first got home, yet now it was the few that remained and her shear force that kept me in check.

Half pushing, and half guiding she forced me into the en-suite shower.&nbsp; It was larger than the one in the main bathroom of the house and I had also made one small modification for play such as this.&nbsp; Pushing me to the back wall she let go of my cuffs and grabbed a locking clasp from the soap-tray.&nbsp; Hooking the clasp to the D ring on the front of my collar she push me forward until my nose now pressed into the back wall.&nbsp; Built into the wall was a fixed mounting point that I had installed shortly after we had moved in.&nbsp; It was at the perfect height for me in my collar, and with the clasp it locked me so that my nose was only just touching the wall.&nbsp; It was a perfect single point restraint that was extremely useful should I ever need to be hosed down.

With me firmly restrained to my current position she went back out into the bedroom and came back with some more equipment.&nbsp; She crouched behind me and locked a thick leather cuff to each of my ankles.&nbsp; Pushing my legs apart she then clipped a spreader bar between them, leaving me completely exposed, the addition also applied more pressure to my collar as now I was a little shorter against the wall mount.&nbsp; My head now slightly tilted up by the pressure of the collar and clasp, I tried to get better footing on tippy toes, although it did not help much.

She shut the shower door behind us both and turned on the water, first switching the flow over to the hand-held shower head and not the main shower head above me.&nbsp; Getting the water to a
comfortable temperature she then set about hosing me down.&nbsp; Once thoroughly soaked, she turned the hose away and began soaping my body.&nbsp; Expecting to be doused with the usual gel soap we both used day to day, I was surprised when she started rubbing me over with a bar of grit soap, normally only used to get the stubbornest of muck from your hands.&nbsp; As she rubbed into my skin it felt like being massaged with sandpaper.&nbsp; What she was doing felt great but the bar of soap was ripping into my skin.&nbsp; I moaned at the harshness of it having just had the greatest of seductive teases and now suffering the payment for it.

I groaned again as she found a sensitive spot on my lower back, giving me a tap to the back of the head she effectively hit me twice as my face hit the tiles.&nbsp; She worked the soap from my shoulders, arms and back, then went to work on my arse.&nbsp; Either I wasn't clean to the standard she wanted, or she seemed to enjoy the restrained moans and grumbles I was giving off as she worked that area until I felt as red as a tomato.&nbsp; I pulled and wriggled against the spreader bar and wall fixing as she finally continued down onto my legs, building a good soapy lather as she went.&nbsp; Once she reached the cuffs of my ankles she took the hand-held shower head and rinsed me down, the warm water soothing the harshness my skin had just endured.

Once content that the the back half was nice and clean to her standards it was time to work the front.&nbsp; Reaching around between myself and the shower wall, she grabbed a handful of balls in a vice-like grip.&nbsp; I winced at the pain, all thoughts of the gritty soap gone as her method of control was absolute.&nbsp; Her free hand came up to the clasp and unhooked me from the wall.&nbsp; Leading with my balls as guidance she twisted and I followed as best as the spreader would allow.&nbsp; Turning with my back to the wall she pulled up forcing me to back up until pressed hard up to the wall.&nbsp; She let go of her grip and used both hands to re-clasp my collar to the wall.&nbsp; 

With the spreader taking a small fraction of my hight, and the handcuffs keeping my arms back against the wall, I now found that the collar was tight around the front, not that it was restricting any breathing but it did stop me from being able to tilt my head and look down.&nbsp; As she now stood before me in all of her natural beauty, no matter how hard I tried I couldn't look down to take it all in.&nbsp; For some reason I felt this was just another of her planned coincidences. 

This time she picked up the gel soap and a loofah, she then looked straight into my eyes and smiled that wonderful evil smile, I just knew that they were not for me.&nbsp; She turned the water back on and was about to soak herself, but she didn't grab the hand-held instead she turned the flow of water back to the main shower head.&nbsp; That shower head was directly over my head and immediately I was soaked in the torrent.&nbsp; With the restraints there was no way to move from the flow or even cover up, coughing a little at first I focused and found a sweet spot in the flow and waited for her to change back to the hand-held.&nbsp; She didn't though, instead she was wetting herself from the overflow bouncing off the unmoving victim.&nbsp; It was more than enough for her to get a good lather of soap up managing to complete her entire cleaning with the flow.&nbsp; Not that she rushed to do it, she enjoyed her time in such close intimate proximity, but with absolute control over all that was happening.

As she switched the flow back to the hand-held I felt the water flow stop and the last of the drops fell away to reveal my Mistress now clean and happy with herself.&nbsp; Coughing up the last of the water she took hold of the gritty soap and went to work building a lather on my front half.&nbsp; Starting at the shoulders and working down over the chest and stomach, she then took a detour and skipped my groin with the harsh soap.&nbsp; Moving straight to the legs she finished of with some harsh scrubbing on the inner thighs, and shins.&nbsp; As I wriggled about against the lathering, giving off the usual moans of discontent, she slapped me hard enough that I had a red hand print inside of the red mark left from the soap.&nbsp; I stemmed my groans as best I could until she reached the cuffs on my ankles.

Looking me straight in the eye again with that evil smile, she again switched to the gel and loofah.&nbsp; She poured a substantial amount onto the loofah and then took it from my sight.&nbsp; I felt it as she thrust it hard into my groin, squashing my cock and balls in one hit, enough to the point that I tried to back up, but only managing to push myself further into the wall I was fixed to.&nbsp; She then smiled at my grimaced face and knelt down in front of me, dropping out of my field of vision.&nbsp; I strained against the collar but the soaked worn leather was still too strong, denying any chance of seeing what she was up to.

I felt her work the loofah from the outside working slowly inwards to my cock now burning with pain and pleasure from the constant night of tease and denial.&nbsp; She grabbed my unprotected balls in one hand causing a flinch, her response to the flinch was a good squeeze and twist.&nbsp; Without any words I knew it was a warning, and without any sense of what was happening other than touch, I really had to concentrate on being still.&nbsp; I felt the last of the loofah as she finished lathering up, discarding it to the floor she then began to rub the lathered soap that was already there.&nbsp; She kept one hand on massaging my balls, playfully squeezing each of my balls between her fingers and flipping them about within their own natural confinement.&nbsp; Her other hand now worked its way up and down my hard shaft, following and feeling ever contour and crease.&nbsp; Combined with the warmth of the confined space of the shower, the tightness of the restraints she chose, and the gentle massaging I was now enduring, I felt myself beginning to climax.&nbsp; She too sensed this and gave both a harsh squeeze to break my moment.&nbsp; Once satisfied that I wasn't going to reach a climax that she had not authorised, she went back to teasing it back from me.&nbsp; 

She continued her cycle pushing to the limit and then breaking it until there came a point that it was getting harder to break it.&nbsp; The climax was going to come if she kept to the same tactics, pushing to the brink one last time she let go and stood back.&nbsp; 

�There you go, you're all clean again now,� she pointed out not expecting an answer from her now over stimulated willing victim.&nbsp; She then added, �I think I'll just let you rinse off for a little bit now, and get your mind back to the present.&nbsp; By the way, if you need to 'go' now is your last chance for the night, I would suggest you make the most of it.�

With those words of advice she turned the water to the main shower head and switched the water to cold.&nbsp; The ice cold water hit like an anvil, instantly washing away any feelings of bliss and pleasure and forcing me to pull on the restraints trying to be free of the icy torrent.&nbsp; She stepped out and closed the door to the shower to dry herself off and prepare.&nbsp; Amidst the cold water pounding down, I took her words of advice and let go of my bladder in preparation for whatever she still had planned.

It didn't last all that long as she knew that there was a limit to the cold I could take, and in the 
minute or two she waited, I felt like I had endured an hour.&nbsp; She switched the water off and crouched down to unhook the spreader bar so I could walk out.&nbsp; Once I had the water out from my eyes I could see that she had slipped into a simple black bra and panties.&nbsp; With my ankles now free I gained a very limited amount of movement back.&nbsp; As I fidgeted about she gave a little playful slap to my leg, so much so that even without words it was not intended to command me to stop.

She left and got my leash once more, and clipped it to the front of my collar.&nbsp; Unhooking the clasp attaching me to the shower wall she gave me back some freedom and lead me out of the shower and onto the tiles.&nbsp; Loosely hanging my leash on the towel rail, she then set about drying my body of from its recent rinse.&nbsp; The soft towel a blessing to my skin, after the harshness of the soap and and the cold of the rinse, it was like being wrapped in cotton wool.

Once finished she took the leash and I followed her back into the bedroom, where she once again signalled me to kneel for her.&nbsp; As I knelt down the cold and experiences began to take their toll and I started to shiver.&nbsp; I tried to stem it, but no matter how hard I wanted it, my teeth continued their own song.&nbsp; 

�Awww, that's no good, you have a shiver.&nbsp; I'm guessing that's from the cold water, but it's ok, I have something to fix that.&nbsp; All we have to do is give you something comfortable to wear�

She went over to the dresser again and this time she pulled out a full leather hood.&nbsp; She came back and stood behind me.&nbsp; As this hood had a built-in collar, she was going to have to remove&nbsp; my now soggy leather collar.&nbsp; Unlocking the little padlock she unbuckled the collar and dropped it to the floor.&nbsp; Taking the hood, she fed if carefully over my face, pushing it around until it was sitting in the right place, then methodically tightened the lacing down the back.&nbsp; I could feel with each tug of the lacing the soft leather conforming and compressing its way around my face.&nbsp; Once she was happy to have the hood nice and tight she tied off the lacing, buckled the fixed collar and replaced the small padlock to this new piece of attire.

She went back to the dresser and came back with the hood's gag.&nbsp; This was one of the first hoods that was bought for me, it was also one of the most comfortable.&nbsp; It is a soft leather hood with eye, nose and mouth openings, but also has both a gag and blindfold that can be attached with press studs.&nbsp; It was this gag that she now pushed into my waiting mouth and locked there with four press studs.

�See, I told you, no more chattering teeth, you're all better now,� she said with a smile of content.

She walked the other way and opened our 'toy' chest.&nbsp; It was a heavy antique looking chest with a lock on the lid, we had bought it as a safe place to put the things we liked to keep private.&nbsp; It was not until now that it dawned on me that all night she had been taking things from the dresser, things that are usually kept in the chest.&nbsp; She now lead me over to it by the arm so that I could take a look inside.&nbsp; It was empty, well almost, she had made a few modifications.&nbsp; She had lined the bottom of the chest with a rubber mat and&nbsp; at each end on the floor were three eyelet fixing points, she had also put some flush mounted electric fans for airflow on the back wall of the chest.&nbsp; Even with the hood, she knew I had a look of surprise across my face.

With a little encouragement she got me to step into the chest and made me stand at one end.&nbsp; She took some clasps from the dresser and used them to attach my sodden ankle cuffs to the two eyelets in the corners.&nbsp; My feet now fixed inside the chest, my immediate fate was becoming clear.&nbsp; Seeing that my breathing was becoming relaxed and accepting the fate she was laying out, she chose to take away some of that certainty.&nbsp; Grabbing the blindfold for the hood, she didn't waste any time blocking away my sight of what she was doing, purposely using excessive pressure on each of the press studs.

The world now dark and my ability to speak gone, I awaited her next step.&nbsp; It wasn't as I expected, leaving me to stand I could hear her over by the bed preparing something for me.&nbsp; It took her a while as I stood naked, feet rooted in place with my hands still cuffed back and a blinding hood taking away my most useful of senses.&nbsp; When she came back to me, she took my cuffed hands and unlocked my wrists, freeing my arms once more for the night.&nbsp; She let me stretch them and free up some circulation for a few moments before she took both wrists and and gently held them out in front of myself.

Taking a thick rope she started winding around my wrist and cinching them tightly together.&nbsp; She didn't use all of the rope, leaving the tie with a long tail of robe hanging from it.&nbsp; She then left to the dresser and quickly returned.&nbsp; This time she motioned me to hold my hands up and to the side, so as to be out of her way.&nbsp; I felt her grab at my balls once more, stretching and pulling at them, as I felt the cold of steel clamp around my sack.&nbsp; Tightening the bolt used to lock the ball weight in place I could feel her care to not pinch any skin in the opening.&nbsp; As she let go of my new piece of jewellery I felt its weight tug gently down, a weight I had been used to before, but one that over time becomes more and more intense.

Tugging at the excess rope from my wrists, she lead it between my legs as she motioned me to kneel down into the chest.&nbsp; Feeding the lose end of the rope through the middle eyelet right between my feet she carefully pulled it through until I felt the tug on my wrists.&nbsp; Pulling a little firmer the rope guided my hands down between my legs and towards my feet.&nbsp; As she pulled harder, I couldn't help but fold down into the crate and onto my compressed legs.&nbsp; Once she was happy with my posture and position, being certain not to pull my wrists too far, she tied off the rope leaving me hopelessly bound within the crate. 

She reached inside and flipped a small switch turning on the near silent fans, and if it weren&#8217;t for the air movement on my still slightly damp skin, I would never have known they were there.&nbsp; Leaning over the chest she seductively ran her fingers up and down my back a few times, before moving a little closer and fondling my leather clad head.

�You have done very well tonight, and now is your first reward for entertaining me.&nbsp; Here is the peace you craved.�&nbsp; I felt her kiss the back of my head.&nbsp; �I'm going to leave you for a little while, you don't have to worry about a thing, just wait for me.&nbsp; I've got some things that need doing and when I am ready to play with my favourite toy again tonight, I'll come get it back out of the crate.�&nbsp; I wanted to say thank you and even if the gag were not there I know I still wouldn't be able to get it out, but there will be a time that I can tell her, and she knew this is what I want too.

She kissed the back of my head again then stood, with one last look at my predicament, and being sure she had not forgotten anything, she shut the lid and locked it closed.&nbsp; I heard her through the lid as she replaced the table cloth and nick knacks that normally sat atop the chest, and cleaned up around the room.

I adjusted myself as best as my restraints would allow me, as well as testing how little movement I had.&nbsp; Her words echoed in my mind, yet it was only three of them that hit me the most, 'her favourite toy'.&nbsp; My fate had been chosen, I was loving it, the hood and the crate felt fantastic in their basic confinement, the restraints doing their job giving me that sense of safety and incapacity to have nothing expected of me, and finally the ball weight, a simple tool, yet one that reminded me who it was that controlled my wants and desires.

As I sat locked in my box with little possibility of changing my situation, I could not help but begin to wonder where it had all gone right, and I wouldn't want to have it any other way.&nbsp; In the dark I waited, in my peace I let my mind go not expecting it to come back.&nbsp; Time became nothing as my breathing set the rhythm and my body gave in to its forced position.&nbsp; It didn't take long for me to find some sub-space and turn off.

My hands were the first to go to sleep, followed by my folded legs beneath me, but I never lost the feeling of my balls.&nbsp; The weight doing it's job of softly holding pressure on my most sensitive of areas, reminding me that even if they were mine I had given up my control as a gift for her.

I have no idea how long the night had gone, or even how long I had been in the chest so far.&nbsp; I hadn't noticed it at the time, but in hindsight she had removed all of the clocks that I may have seen during her planned evening.&nbsp; She had guided me from planned scene to planned scene and I loved her for the detail, the planning, her ability to read me.&nbsp; Now I had nothing, no decisions, no responsibilities, no need to be anything but an object for my Mistress.

Savouring the serenity I never heard her just outside my cage of solitude.&nbsp; She busied herself around the room preparing her last treat for the evening.&nbsp; It had been just over two hours since she locked the lid on her favourite toy.&nbsp; She gently took the items back off the top of the grand chest and folded the table cloth before putting in on the floor.&nbsp; Retrieving the chest key from the safety of the dresser she unlocked the lid, ready for the last stage of her diligently planned evening.

She lifted the lid and light spewed into the chest, not that it did any good for its willing victim inside.&nbsp; It was the air movement and temperature change that told me it was time.&nbsp; She started simply with a caring hand stroking my slightly arched back, the touch creating a shiver of movement throughout my body against the bonds. Methodically feeling her way over my conformed body, the tender touch warmed wherever she roamed.&nbsp; She felt down and around my face, her touch like that of an angel through the soft bound leather covering my identity.

Untying the rope holding my hands between my feet I felt the slack and then my wrists dropped to the rubber mat.&nbsp; With a little encouragement and a gentle hand against my chest she guided me back to a kneeling position, knowing that my body would be cramped and taught from the inactivity of being encased.&nbsp; My breathing still slow began to quicken with the stimulation I was now getting, amplified by pain from unused muscles.&nbsp; She took my wrists and slowly removed their bindings, once off she tenderly rubbed and massaged some of the pain away.

I felt her hand then move to my ankles and unclasp them from the fixings within the chest, but not removing the leather cuffs themselves.&nbsp; She moved around behind me and her arms locked under mine she helped me lift myself to a sitting position on the edge of the chest.&nbsp; My entire body groaning at me for being held stagnant for so long and now refusing to work at usual.&nbsp; Once propped up and sitting with my arms free she left me to regain my circulation, and went back to preparing the bed for use.

She took her time, giving me some well needed recovery, she left to the kitchen and came back with a tray of goodies.&nbsp; Pulling the gag from its press studs I felt my mouth gain freedom that I had long since forgotten it should have.&nbsp; She held a glass of cool water to my lips and I took what I needed.&nbsp; Once done she put the gag back to my lips and I opened up for her to put it back in place.&nbsp; Putting the water out of the way she reattached the leash to my neck for the last time of the night.&nbsp; 

A gentle tug guided me up and standing again, although my legs still a little wobbly from the aches and pains.&nbsp; She gave me the time to find my legs, like a fowl learning to walk for the first time.&nbsp; Eventually time came and she made me step out of the chest and back to the soft carpet of the bedroom.&nbsp; Pins and needles now assaulted my legs as I followed her guidance over to the king sized bed.&nbsp; With a few simple touches I understood her commands and made my way to lay down face up right in the centre of the soft comfortable mattress. 

She took each of my ankles and attached them with short chains to each of the metal corner posts of the bed end.&nbsp; Wrapping each of my now free wrists with leather cuffs of their own, she then followed suit and fixed each of those the the corner posts above my head.&nbsp; Spread eagled and still slightly cramped she took out some oils and went to work massaging away the remaining pains.

Her hands soft and lovesome as the found their own way into every crevice of my body, at times&nbsp; finding something sensitive, but always leaving nothing but relief.&nbsp; Still well an truly lost to a world not our own, I followed her in my mind around my body, involuntary moans and groans escaping my gagged mouth for her entertainment.

Once she reached my cock and balls she grabbed the tool to remove the ball weight and release me from the heavy steel confinement.&nbsp; I left out a groan of love for her as the steel fell away to be replaced by her loving fingers massaging away their torment.&nbsp; I felt my cock growing hard to her touch as it had so many times so far this evening, yet never getting to reach its goal.&nbsp; She finished the massage with a few calculated stokes of my shaft.&nbsp; Leaving that to its own, she then climbed up onto the bed with me and straddle me around the waist.&nbsp; Her legs falling back against mine and my cock being teased with the faintest of touches from her spread cheeks.

Turning her attention back to my face she pulled the gag from my mouth and followed it with a kiss.&nbsp; Her lips pressed against the leather of the hood but their intent well understood, her tongue invading me conveying her full intentions.&nbsp; She made the most of my predicament and started to pull away, and my head following as best it could, never wanting end such a loving moment.

With my head raised as far as I could manage she slipped a hand in behind and pulled the knot on the lacing.&nbsp; I felt the shift in pressure on my face as the leather relaxed around my head.&nbsp; Grabbing the key she unlocked and unbuckled the collar, releasing my neck for only the second time of the night.&nbsp; With her hands reaching around behind my head she pulled the leather back undoing the taught lacing, the leather loosening itself from my face.&nbsp; Giving a little tug she then slipped the hood off over my head and the light of the room bombarded my sight.

Leaning back in she finished the kiss she had started, my eyes closed to the harshness of the light, I was left savouring her taste.&nbsp; With a simple kiss she gave me what I needed, the torments and pains of the night washing away leaving nothing but the pleasure of her efforts behind.

Leaving my in a dizzy state I felt her lips leave mine and her weight shift as she sat straight up against my waist.&nbsp; I opened my eyes as best I could, to see her high above me, the woman whom I loved and would do anything she ever desired.&nbsp;&nbsp; She fired a loving smile at me, my own face trying to smile back, but still suffering the effects of the confining hood.&nbsp; 

She turned around atop me and moved her hips back up towards my head, my bindings allowing her to take whatever position she saw fit.&nbsp; Hooking her feet over my shoulders she crouched back down, giving me nothing to see but her womanhood.&nbsp; Giving a little starter she bumped herself into my nose and I lifted my head a little and set about kissing what she presented.&nbsp; My enthusiasm growing as I turned from kissing to some licking and working my tongue between her lips.&nbsp; The taste of her hit my palette and fuelled me for more, as I set about giving her the pleasure that she had bestowed on me for the evening.

I felt her shift with my invasions of her most sacred of gifts, as my tongue probed its way around her clit.&nbsp; After a short while the wetness came as she built towards her reward for all the effort.&nbsp; Pushing back into my head I felt her lay her body on mine, her breasts resting softly against my waist.&nbsp; She then took my solid member in her mouth and sent a wave of pleasure throughout my entire body, involuntarily making me pull against the firm bonds keeping me spread eagled.&nbsp; 

As she worked her mouth up and down my shaft, her tongue wrapping and teasing all that it found, I reciprocated and worked harder at my task trying to push her over the edge of bliss.&nbsp; For the moment we were bound as one, each lost in a world of pleasure having pushed ourseleves this far and now the final steps to reach the end.&nbsp; I was determined to push her there first and doubled my efforts to the extent of trying to block out the sensations she was sending into my tethered body.

I felt her teetering on the edge just as I too was getting there, the race almost to its end.&nbsp; With one last thrust I gave her clitoris a soft bite as I also sucked with my sealed lips.&nbsp; She promptly sat up arching her back, convolutions bombarding her body, and compressing my head down into the mattress, my air supply cut.&nbsp; She came and shook all at once, perched precariously atop my face.&nbsp; 

Her efforts were not wasted as I too reached the point of no return and fired my load back up against my belly.&nbsp; The pressure of her body weight against my face coupled with the restriction of breath, took me beyond my self control. 

Finally, we both were left feeling fulfilled. 

She lifted herself from me as her orgasm subsided, leaving her filled with contentment and returning my ability to breathe once more.&nbsp; Once we had both returned from a place of bliss to our bedroom together she climbed off my torso, and disappeared into the en-suite to clean up.&nbsp; As I lay there still bound tightly to the bed I couldn't help but reflect on the night as it had been.&nbsp; She had managed to find everything that I loved and crammed it into one special night that neither of us would ever forget.&nbsp; She had reached perfection in my mind, and the only sad though I had, was that each night like this from now on would be measured by this one.

She returned after freshening herself and brought with her a dampened towel.&nbsp; She then set about the task of wiping down my face cleaning me of the enjoyment we had just experienced together, and followed with cleaning up my own stickiness.

After returning the towel, took a light duvet and made the bed over my spread eagled form.&nbsp; She then turned off the main light to room leaving only a side lamp still on.&nbsp; Slipping in under the sheet beside me, she reached over and kissed me on the cheek.

�I love you.&nbsp; You did fantastic tonight, I'm so proud of you.&nbsp; Good night,� she said turning off the bed lamp

She then snuggled her warm body up against mine, hooking a leg over mine and an arm over my chest, finally resting her head on my shoulder for a pillow.&nbsp; After a moment it sunk in to me that this was how I was going to sleep tonight, still bound but in the arms of the one that cared for me.&nbsp; Closing my eyes, my body felt exhausted, I was drained and it didn't take long even in the stretched out position for me to find sleep.&nbsp; 

As I drifted off to the dream world I was left with only one thought.&nbsp; I knew I had a fifty fifty chance of waking up in the morning still bound, and if that were the case then I know I had an even longer day ahead of me.

The End.
