Synopsis: College girl on her way back to school in the fall and has car trouble in the desert. She encounters a "Good Samaritan" who turns out not to be so good after all.DESERT BOUND
By Silky Sullivan
It was a sweltering August day with not a cloud in the sky. According to the
  digital gauge on the dash of Traci's black Mustang convertible, the temperature
  was at 108 degrees and climbing. Although it was tempting to let the top down
  and allow her gorgeous shoulder length blonde tresses to be caressed by the
  gentle breeze, the persistent penetrating rays of the Mojave Desert sun persuaded
  her otherwise. As Traci's car streaked across the desolate countryside, she
  daydreamed of her summer adventures while working at a local casino in her
  hometown of Las Vegas . The summer had been much too short and it was now time
  to return to UCLA for her senior year. Rather than take the main highway back
  to Los Angeles , Traci opted for the backroads to take in some new scenery.
  On this particular afternoon, it seemed at times that her car was virtually
  the only one on the road. Traci had never been one to be apprehensive about
  traveling alone and had no reservations about it today either. As she continued
  to think about her summer vacation and the school year ahead, her foot seemed
  to get a bit heavy on the accelerator and before she knew it, the speedometer
  reading had passed 90 miles per hour but Traci seemed unconcerned. She couldn't
  imagine the police patrolling this deserted stretch of highway. 
Completely immersed in her thoughts, it took the hint of a smell of antifreeze
  to arouse her from her trancelike state. At first she dismissed it as just
  her imagination but when the smoke began billowing from underneath the hood,
  her heart sank and she realized that she had no choice but to pull over and
  call for help. The Mustang limped to the shoulder of the two lane highway and
  Traci immediately turned off the ignition. She pulled out her map and realized
  that the next town of any size was at least 45 miles away. She extracted her
  cell phone from her purse and dialed 911, only to find out that she was in
  an area where there was no cell signal. A sickening feeling began to creep
  in as her mind raced to come up with a plan. Well, she guessed that she would
  just have to wait until a car passed through this area and stopped to help.
  She would have to be patient. The minutes turned into hours as she waited for
  assistance. Then she heard the sound of a vehicle approaching from the west.
  As the car came into view, it appeared to be a late model red sports car of
  some type. Traci stood beside her car and waved her arms as the car approached
  but as it neared her, it became painfully obvious that this driver was not
  going to stop. The car was being driven by an older lady who seemed to be either
  unconcerned or too scared to stop. Traci began to panic as the sun began to
  sink in the western sky. The silhouettes of the multitude of cactus plants
  that dotted the stark landscape gave Staci an eerie feeling .If help didn't
  arrive soon, these silhouettes would serve as her only companions in the dark
  desert wilderness. She only had one bottle of water and a candy bar and although
  she was already hungry and thirsty, she dared not touched either yet as she
  had no idea when help would arrive. Although Traci had always been fairly brave
  and not one to worry a lot, the sounds of the desert critters spooked her a
  bit. She tried to block out the sounds by thinking about pleasurable things
  and it seemed to work somewhat, as she did drift off briefly into a light sleep. 
It was the headlights of a car approaching from her rear that reflected in
  her rear view mirror and awoke her. Her heart began to pound with anticipation
  as the car slowed and pulled in behind her and stopped. Although she was very
  grateful that a good Samaritan had finally arrived, she was still wary and
  kept her doors locked. A shadowy figure emerged from the car and slowly ambled
  up to her driver's window. Traci cracked her window a few inches and peered
  out at a middle aged man with thinning hair and muscular build. He seemed to
  be quite nice and politely asked Traci if he could help her. As she looked
  into his eyes, she felt that this was a person that she could trust. Of course,
  she really didn't have any choice. �Need a lift somewhere?� he asked. Traci
  immediately responded in the affirmative , unlocking the door and slowly opening
  it. As she emerged and got closer to the man, she felt even better about him.
  He had kind eyes and seemed to be a genuinely caring person. �I'll be glad
  to drive you to the next town, which is about 40 miles away.� I live about
  5 miles past town and can drop you off at the motel where I will call a wrecker
  for you. There's a small repair shop in town who should be able to get you
  up and running in no time.� You look like you need some food and a good night's
  sleep. Traci nodded and thanked the man for stopping to help. �By the way,
  what's your name?� Traci asked. �The name's Fred but everyone around here calls
  me Stubby�, the man replied. �Grab your gear and hop in.� Traci gathered up
  her purse and locked up her car and slowly walked back to the passenger side
  of Stubby's older model Chevy Caprice. Just as she started to open the door,
  she felt an arm grab her around the neck and she screamed. Her shrieks of terror
  were quickly muffled by a large white cotton handkerchief that was shoved between
  her sensuous lips and held in place by a gray piece of duct tape that was roughly
  slapped over her mouth. Stubby pushed her into the back seat and began to tie
  her arms and hands together with some thin cotton rope that was lying in the
  floorboard of the car. He then wound numerous strands of rope around her ankles
  and tied a short length between her ankles and wrists. Although her hands were
  tied in front of her, she was helpless in this reverse hogtie. As Traci peered
  into Stubby's eyes, she no longer saw the kind, caring man that had stopped
  to help. He now had a sneer on his face as he jeered at her with an evil snicker, �Well
  little lady, I guess you're mine for the night. By the way, you will be much
  more comfortable in my humble abode than you would have been in the local motel.
  You may as well relax and enjoy the ride. We'll be there soon. Then the fun
  can begin.� 
Fear enveloped Traci's writhing body as she made a feeble attempt to free
  herself. What did this man want from her? She knew the answer but didn't want
  to dwell on it. Only minutes had passed but it seemed like hours when the old
  Chevy made a right turn off the highway onto a rough dirt road. Soon the car
  pulled up in front of what appeared to be a dilapidated frame house. She could
  see a small kerosene lamp flickering inside what appeared to be the living
  room of the small structure. Stubby pulled up to the front door, shut off the
  engine, and opened the rear door. He threw Traci's bound and helpless body
  over his shoulder. She attempted to cry out but the handkerchief and tape reduced
  her cries to muffled moans as the door was opened and she was tossed onto an
  old couch in the front room like a bag of dirty laundry. Stubby removed the
  tape and the handkerchief that had filled her pretty mouth. �Well, I guess
  I'd better give you something to eat and drink before we get too involved.
  You're going to be tied up for quite some time. Of course, if you're a good
  girl, I may untie you later.� Traci gobbled up the crackers that he fed her
  and gulped down the bottle of water. She had barely swallowed the last drop
  of water when a large white silk scarf was forced into her mouth until it completely
  disappeared between her full lips. Before she could spit it out, another scarf
  parted those gorgeous lips and was wound twice around her head and then tied
  cruelly tight in a knot at the nape of her neck. Another scarf was tied over
  her eyes to prevent her from seeing what this evil man had planned for her
  next. Traci squealed in protest but Stubby ignored her pleas and threw her
  over his shoulder again, carrying her into his bedroom. He dropped her onto
  the rickety old four poster bed and rolled her onto her back. He immediately
  untied the ankle and wrist ropes and began to slide Traci's skin tight jeans
  down to her ankles and then removed them entirely. Stubby began to feel a stirring
  in his loins as he gazed at the half dressed lovely young lady that was now
  his prisoner. He swiftly attached her arms to the bed posts at the head of
  the bed after removing her pale yellow cotton top, leaving her clad only in
  a very sexy light peach colored satin bra with matching thong. Stubby moved
  to her lower extremities next, attaching both ankles to the posts at the foot
  of the bed. The ropes at all four corners were pulled as tight as a fiddle,
  leaving the poor girl in a severe spread eagle position. Stubby could contain
  himself no longer. He noticed that, despite her muffled protests, the crotch
  of her panties appeared to be getting damp. Could it be that she was enjoying
  this? Stubby began to slide his pants down, revealing a massive hunk of meat
  between his legs. It was certainly obvious that his nickname was not a reference
  to a lack of size of his manhood. Stubby decided that he wanted Traci to see
  what was about to happen to her so he removed the silk pad from her eyes. As
  her eyes adjusted to the flickering light of the kerosene lamp, she focused
  on the gargantuan love tool that glistened with pre-cum only inches from her
  mouth. Traci was both horrifed and strangely excited at the sight and felt
  an intense tingling in her twat. Stubby removed the silken gag and thrust his
  ten inches of love muscle between her lips. At first, she protested but after
  tasting the slightly salty pre-cum, she greedily suck the tool further into
  her throat. Stubby began to get up a rhythm as the one eyed monster pushed
  deeper and deeper into Traci's accommodating throat. Before exploding, Stubby
  withdrew his rod and quickly regagged her. He unhooked her satin bra, revealing
  an ample set of perky white breasts with large pink nipples that were standing
  erect as a result of the stimulating events that had just occurred. Then Stubby
  pulled out his pocket knife and sliced the thin bands of silky satin that held
  the thong in place. He tossed the panties aside and peered at a completely
  shaven snatch that was wet and waiting for some action. He moved his head between
  her legs and buried his tongue between her tight pussy lips, running it up
  to the top where it met an erect clit, standing like a soldier at attention.
  Traci could contain her excitement no longer. She let out a shriek of delight
  as Stubby's talented tongue tangled with the ever hardening mound of joy. The
  voluminous gag could not begin to silence Traci sufficiently as she writhed
  in ecstasy on the creaky bed. Stubby could contain himself no longer as he
  positioned his member at the precipice of her love canal. As he slowly pushed
  his huge swollen purple head past her pussy lips, Traci seemed to be trying
  to mouth the words �fuck me hard�. Certainly Stubby wanted to oblige his sweet
  captive(if you could consider her a captive at this point). So he pushed deeper
  into her tightness until his entire third leg was buried to the hilt. He began
  to stroke with a tender but vicious pounding. Suddenly his engorged tip hit
  Traci's G-spot as she exploded into a multiorgasmic frenzy. Almost simultaneously,
  Stubby erupted with a ferocity that could only be matched by Mt. St. Helens
  . He withdrew his pistol and collapsed on top of Traci where the two spent
  the remainder of the night. 
As the sun peeked above the desert horizon, Stubby and Traci awoke from their
  kinky night of passion. Stubby started cooking breakfast for Traci and told
  her that he would call the wrecker to pick up her car so that she could get
  it fixed and hit the road again. Traci gave him a wink and replied,� �Who says
  I'm in a hurry to go? I've got a few days before school starts� After finishing
  off a hearty breakfast, the two retired once again to the creaky bed where
  they explored their mutual passion for kink for the next two days. 
As Traci sped off toward California in her newly repaired car, she couldn't
  wipe the grin off her face as she thought about the previous three days that
  had exposed an unexplored passion for kinky sex. She pushed the pedal to the
  metal as she daydreamed about the adventures that awaited her down the road.
  Boy, it was going to be an exciting senior year!
