Golden Chains in Sherazad
&nbsp;&nbsp; This one is completely the work of my depraved imagination. (With some inspiration from Jade Dragon and Eucher).� I hope you enjoy reading it as much as I enjoyed writing it.
&nbsp; I really wanted to revel in Queen Kailya�s humiliation so it required a fairly lengthy introduction. I mention nasty things like rape etc but for tags, (M/F, cons, fantasy, oral, inter)
&nbsp; Secondly this is an adult story, if you are younger than eighteen DO NOT READ!!!
&nbsp; If you liked it drop me an email saridu@yahoo.co.uk if not fuck off.
&nbsp;&nbsp; Chapter 1 : Queen of Galandria
&nbsp;&nbsp; The two generals strode purposefully through the castle gardens. Farouk�s chainmail softly chiming, his brother enchanted robes softly flapping in the wind. 
 Queen Kaiyla shivered despite the magically controlled room temperature. The men were well built, their ebon skin shaped their hard muscles. The ruler has never fantasised about the dark men of Kalish but the recent invasion of the Duchies, combined with the two men�s commanding aura left her wondering if they were good in bed. Kailya berated herself, it was her lonely bed she told herself, she played with her new wedding ring and sighed, her eyes never leaving the dangerous men. 
 The one general was tall and well built, a scimitar rested comfortably on his hip. His head was bald and he had a trimmed goatee. Over his suit of finely crafted chain mail he wore a loose silk shirt and pants, common for the men from the south. 
 The other 
bodyguard, was also very muscular, His black hair was short and curly, he wore a goatee like his companion but was dressed in loose fitting silken robes, complete with slippers rather than boots. 
 �They look like hungry wolves.� Her daughter joined her at the window. 
 �They are Chandra, we must be careful tonight. The ambassador is one of the Sultan�s favourites, we will not do anything to anger the him.
�. 
 The silver sea duchies, though well garrisoned with mercenaries were no match for the disciplined army of the Sultan of Kalish. From the daring sea battle to the lightning strikes in the heart of the province, the campaign had been swift and brutal. Queen Kailya felt her throat dry unconsciously. The stories coming from the flood of refugees was horrifying. The king of Delamnia was hanged from his castle gates, his wife flogged and forced to watch her daughter�s gang rape in the courtyard. All the woman enslaved, the men sent to labour camps. She steadied her hand, she had to remain calm and in control, Galandria�s army was well sized and prepared, it would not be such a soft target as the 
dutchies. She would make peace with the Sultan while making allies with her other neighbours. 
 �Your father is joining us tonight.� She started purposefully. 
 �Don�t call him that, he will never be my father. You married him mother because the guilds forced you 
to, we are not blind to the truth.� Her daughter�s bright blue eyes shone back at her. 
 Queen Kailya touched her daughter�s arm. 
 �I am blessed to have such a loyal daughter. But Chandra, we must appear united tonight, 
King , Queen and princesses, you are right these generals are hungry wolves sniffing for blood.�. 
 �Why are we entertaining them then?� 
 �My daughter, you have much to learn of the throne.� 
 �That is because I don�t want it mother.� 
 Her mother frowned but ignored the barb. 
 �The Sultan obviously has something to say, and has sent his generals to talk for him.
�. 
 �I hear they are twins brothers, one a skilled warrior, the other a gifted mage.
�. 
 �Yes and powerful adepts, we must be careful.� He mother reiterated. 
 Chandra watched them walk, the two brothers stopped talking. The Kalishite ambassador was talking to the seneschal. Her eyes focused, she was sure, 
somehow she knew the one bodyguard. He looked up, even across the distance his deep brown eyes flashed before her. A night by the fire, their faces close. She gasped and took a step back. 
 �Chandra are you alright, you are as pale as a ghost.� 
 �I,� the princess gulped her tongue dry, �I, I have to train.� Chandra suddenly said before fleeing down the stairs. 
 �This land is cursed brother, the sun hides her face, the woman walk around without veils and the men debauch themselves with alcohol in public
.� 
 �True Farouk, but not cursed, they do not know of 
Kalah�s immense love so she does not shine in their hearts.� 
 �Hmph, then it is right that we must show them.
�, Farouk looked up, gazing intently. 
 �It is her brother?� 
 �Yes Khalim and her beauty is this godless kingdom�s only redeeming value.� 
 �Do you think she will say yes?� 
 �I hope so, but either way she will be mine. The Sultan cannot deny our accomplishments in this campaign brother and I have yet to take a reward. Yes, she will be mine, I will pray to Kalah to keep my feisty lioness safe as we battle. 
 The seneschal greeted the bodyguards and escorted them to a guest suite. 
 �Her majesty Queen Kailya will entertain you for dinner tonight.� He said bowing low. 
 *��������������������� *
��������������������� * 
 Queen Kailya stepped out of the bath into a waiting silk bath robe. 
 �Thank you Tessa but I feel like towelling myself down.� 
 Her young handmaiden curtseyed and left the ruler with her thoughts. 
 Kailya sighed and looked at herself in the 
mirror, she slipped the bathrobe from her shoulders turning in the mirror. 
 The middle aged ruler giggled a little as she cupped her large breasts. They were widely talked about in dark castle corridors and behind her back known as the Mountains of Galandria. Bearing three children has done wonders for the already well endowed Queen and her bosom was more than a handful for most men. The goddess had blessed her with a wonderful figure. Her breasts sagged little and her stomach was still flat, if anything fat had decided to lay siege to her large pale behind. Kailya laughed as she poked her well rounded butt. Not bad for a woman in her late thirties she mused. She had high cheek bones and her husband had always loved her 
pouty, kissable lips and deep blue eyes. The Queen flicked through her long blonde hair preening herself. 
 Her hands came up and she cupped her large breast softly groaning. The queen licked her lips as her fingers started playing with her nipples. Kailya crossed the room and locked the door before lying down on her silken bed sheets. She sighed as her nails gently grazed her inner thighs teasing her needy pussy. The matriarch moaned softly, her eye lids flittering closed, she ran a finger over her lips, kissing her invisible lover. 
 It had been five years since her husband had died. Beren was a great man, a warrior, a diplomat, a caring father and a wonderful husband. His death in a hunting accident had crushed her and she hadn�t taken another man to her bed since then. In the last two years the guilds had placed increasing pressure on her to remarry, to bring stability to their kingdom. 
Valdis had been their choice and she was no fool, she knew where his allegiances lay. 
 She touched her clit and groaned eager to push thoughts of her unwanted husband from her mind. But instead of images of her beloved dead husband, her mind was filled with an ebon skinned man with short black hair and muscles. 
 �No. No, it�s wrong.� 
 Her mind whimpered but her body refused to accept the logical assertion, her long fingers stroking her thighs, her other hand playing with her hard nipples. 
 �I can�t.� her mind desperately tried again. 
 In her reverie he jumped through the window into her bed room, she turned surprised. 
 The powerful man strode up to her and pulled off her crown, throwing it across the room. 
 �You are 
mine now Kailya.� He whispered, pushing her to her knees. 
 The queen found herself helplessly sinking to the floor. 
 �No, this is wrong.� Kailya whimpered on her bed, but her body spread her thighs wide, her hands griping her inner thighs, teasing her pussy. 
 The dream Kailya obediently opened his pants and freed a six inch black cock. 
 �Ummm.� The matriarch groaned as her one hand flicked her clit, she slipped two fingers into her mouth 
hornily sucking. 
 The Queen of Galandria hadn�t given a man a blowjob in years but her body remembered and she could almost feel the thick hot cock in her mouth, sliding between her lips. 
 In her 
dream , her lover pulled her to her feet and took off his shirt, revealing his well muscled chest. 
 They kissed wetly, his hands roving her body, she was wearing her sexy red ball gown, the one she wore to the 
Kavarach ball, many years ago. His hands impatiently unbuttoned the back of her dress before pulling it off her. He picked her up and carried her to the bed. 
 The forbidden dream lover pushed her onto the bed, claiming his prize. 
 �Oh Goddess, yes.� The masturbating Kailya whispered as her fingers circled her breasts, her dream lover hungrily sucking on the large mounds 
 Their lips locked, his strong tongue pushed inside her mouth, he kissed her hotly, their tongues entwining before his head travelled down her body, igniting her. 
 Kailya�s eyes were firmly 
closed, two fingers left her mouth, circled her breasts and then travelled over her stomach to her pussy. 
 �YES!!!� she hissed as they joined the other hand, she spread her pussy lips and pushed two long fingers inside. 
 Her dream lover was sucking her pussy, how she missed 
Beren�s loving tongue! 
 �Oh Goddess no, no, ah, yes.� She fought as her dream self spread her thighs inviting his black cock inside her. 
 Kailya body arched as her two fingers began to roughly pump inside her. 
 �Ugh� she moaned, her thighs were wide, she could already feel her hot juices gushing around her hand, soaking the bed, 
the lonely matriarch hadn�t been this turned on in years. 
 �Goddess, fuck, oh yes shit, harder baby, harder! fuck me hard!!!� she cried out, the reserved Queen blushed as she heard her dirty tongue swear like a sailor, but it turned her on even more. 
 �YES!!!!!!!� the mother of three shrieked as her hips jerked their pelvis lifting off the bed. The Queen rammed three fingers deep inside her steaming pussy and wailed as she orgasmed. 
 A jet of her fluids burst from her pussy as she sprayed hard, her hips thrusting against their invisible lover as she imagined hot cum exploding inside her. 
 Eventually Kailya came down from her mind shattering orgasm. She shook her head, she wasn�t thinking straight, she couldn�t let her sexed starved body interfere with tonight. The ambassador would pounce at any sign of weakness, Galandria had to appear united, 
she lectured herself. 
 Sighing she went to the mirror and allowed herself an indulgent smile, she had never fantasised about the black skin 
Kalishites from across the ocean and definitely not about a man barely older than her daughter. Kailya giggled and nibbled her lip, forbidden and naughty yes but by the Goddess it had been so good. 
 She opened her wardrobe and flipped through her dresses. Kailya wasn�t sure if by chance or by design but the red dress from her dream was in her hands. A sly smile crossed her, since she would never bed the dark skinned Kalishite, she might as well show him what he would never touch. 
 �Tessa! Attend to me.� She called out. 
 Her handmaidens were finally finished preening her and Kailya turned in the mirror critically, yes she would have the advantage tonight. She checked the light crystal and then shuffled through the papers she had signed this afternoon. 
 �What is this?� she picked up a contract and frowned, the Queen had signed troop orders and scouting missions, she didn�t remember a trade contract. 
 Her temperature rose as she scanned the document. 
 *��������������������� *
��������������������� * 
&nbsp; The Queen of Galandria burst through the door into her new husband�s chambers, his servants fleeing before the Queen�s wrath. 
 Valdis was sipping wine in his study. 
 �What by the goddess is the meaning of these!� she threw the contracts onto the table. 
 �What is the meaning of what beloved?� he stood his face full of concern. 
 King Valdis was slight of build with small pin pricks for eyes. Kailya shuddered every time she 
remember their wedding night, his pathetic two inch dick thrusting wildly inside her. That was the last time they had slept together. 
 �Do not call me that!� she thundered back. The queen picked up the papers and waved them accusingly. 
 �I found these concealed between troop orders I signed today. Do you know anything about this!� she spat at him. 
 The king stood and walked up to her, his face innocent. 
 �I don�t 
understand, what papers?� 
 �Don�t lie to me! This contract with the steel guild is not in the crown interest, this clause would redirect almost all of the profit from our steel refinery to the guild. This contract with the harvest guild removes almost all taxes from wheat production, do not lie to me and tell me it is a coincidence!� she screamed at him.

The king�s innocent expression was replaced with annoyance. 
 �Yes these contract pay tribute to the real power in this kingdom.� 
 �How dare you! This is treason!� her shock siphoning her rage away. 
 �Quiet you tongue woman and listen to me.� He suddenly snapped. 
 Queen Kailya had heard the rumours in the corridors that he regularly beat the servants, even took whores to his bed but she had turned a blind eye for the good of her kingdom. He had never spoken to her like this before. 
 �I, don�t you dare speak to me like that.� Her hands were shaking with anger. 
 �Shut up woman! This is what is going to happen from now on. The guilds let you sit apon that throne. A lonely queen with three beautiful daughters, you need the protection my guilds offer.
�. 
 �Protection? Are you threatening me?� 
 �Very clever, now listen if you want to stay on that throne and keep your daughters safe, shut up and sign whatever I give to you, understand beloved.� He 
smirked the last word. 
 Queen Kailya was shaking with 
rage, she would not be extorted by this rat. 
 Their seneschal entered, he took one look at the rulers and quickly bowed. 
 �My apologies your majesty but the ambassador and his bodyguards are waiting in the formal study.
�. 
 Queen Kailya glared at her 
husband, he smiled back sweetly, placing his hand around her waist. 
 �Come along my love, let us meet our guests.� He smiled. 
 The Kalishite ambassador completed his evening prayers and paced agitated. He watched the general�s 
finish their afternoon training and prepare for dinner. 
 After sunset the seneschal entered. 
 �Ambassador Kareef, Queen Kailya and King 
Valdis will listen to what you have to say over dinner.� 
 �Good, I tire of this godless land, come bodyguards.� 
 The two 
brother�s shared annoyed looks before following the pompous diplomat. 
 �Mother!� 
Kailya�s young daughter raced into her arms. 
 Valdis smiled and nodded at his wife, she glared back before closing her eyes enjoying the embrace. 
 �I had a wonderful day mother, I was in the gardens and a rose opened before my eyes!� 
 Kailya fussed with her 
youngest�s long blonde hair. 
 �You must be careful Gemma, nobody must know this, 
it must be kept a secret.� She stared into the young girls deep blue eyes. 
 Her youngest was a splitting image of the ruler in her youth, blessed with her mother�s long blonde hair and deep blue 
eyes, she was tall with a dancers build and an impressive bosom for a maiden of eighteen years. 
 �But mother.� 
 �No buts Gemma, you need to be more careful.� She smiled and held her daughter close again. 
 �Yes mother.� The young girl said resigned. 
 Several months ago her daughter powers had begun to emerge and Queen Kailya was desperately trying to suppress the knowledge. The young maiden was not ready to be an adept yet. 
 Kailya smiled motherly. 
 �The tailor guild did a wonderful job, you look so beautiful.� 
 Gemma blushed, her white ball gown hugged her body tightly and since she was now a maiden was tailored to outline her alabaster breasts. 
 �It�s tight fitting mother and my bosom.� 
 Her mother laughed softly. 
 �You are a maiden now remember. Some day a dashing young man is going to take you away from me.� Queen Kailya straightened out a crease. 
 �Mom, you�re making me blush.� The young girl giggled. 
 Kailya sighed and smiled a little sad. 
 �On the subject, you are looking hot mom!� Gemma teased. 
 It was her mother�s turn to blush a little. 
 �Well, thank you Gemma, sometimes a woman must use her charms against men like these.
�. 
 �Are they dangerous?� 
 �Stay well away from them Gemma, they are wolves sniffing for our blood and I will give them none. Now go and stand with your sisters, the ambassador will be here soon.� 
The two generals followed their ward into the large banquet hall. 
 "May I present Queen Kailya, her new husband Kind Valdis and her three daughters, Princess 
Anjelica, Princess Chandra and Princess Gemma.". 
 Kailya decided to go on the offensive. She took a step forward and extended her hand. Maybe some of the excitement of her forbidden orgasm has stayed with her, she knew the deep red satin ball gown looked good on her, tailored to emphasise her shapely hips and her large breasts and showing just enough cleavage to interest the men but not too much to portray her as a harlot. She had her handmaidens pin her hair in a sophisticated wrap and completed her enticing outfit with metallic red high heels. As Gemma had gushed, her mom looked hot. The ruler decided not to sit around and be bullied by these wolves, she would strike first, show them that 
Galadrian's were a strong and proud people, not afraid of confrontation. 
 Valdis clenched his fists, his wife was being head strong and he hated the senschals careful choice of words. The guilds attempts to buy the old man off had so far failed but Valdis had even bigger plans. He glared angrily at his new wife, the bitch never dressed like that when she was entertaining the guild and since their wedding night, shunned his slightest touch. A cold smiled crossed his face and he leered over his new step daughters, a king's bounty in 
flesh, they would serve him well chained to his bed. 
 An invisible war had broken out between the queen and her guest the Kalishite ambassador. His eyes flashed but the Galadrian queen stood her ground looking down at her hand. Eventually a small smile crossed 
Kareef�s chubby face and the balding, short man bent over and kissed her hand. 
 It was Kailya' turn to be nervous, the ambassador she could handle, if power is what he wanted, she would show him power. The two ebon skinned general's were another matter. They exuded power with their every move and her body responded. The bald brother reached 
forward , bowing gracefully he kissed her outstretched hand. 
�Kalah has blessed you with beautiful daughters.� His lips gently touched her white fingers. 
Farouk�s eyes left the queen to settle on Chandra, she shifted a little uncomfortably. It had been four years and she was even more beautiful than he remembered. Princess Chandra was Queen�s Kailya�s second daughter, in her early twenties she had refused to be courted by nobility instead signing up for the 
Galandrian army at a young age. 
The wilful princess favoured her father�s side, she had high cheek bones, a finely sculptured nose and kissable lips, combined with her hazel eyes she would definitely fetch five rings. Her hair was darker than her mother and sisters, rich honey brown but that just excited the warrior more, her skin was like smooth marble, highly prized by the 
Kalahshites. Farouk was pleased to see her body had also grown over the last four years and her mother had blessed her with a well sized bosom. Her life in the army kept her athletic body toned so she would look good in a dancer�s costume. 
 Queen Kailya blushed a little at the comment. 
 �Thank you.� 
 The second brother stepped forward, the ruler hoped he wouldn�t see her nipple erection, her forbidden afternoon fantasy still fresh in her 
mind, she gulped and held her breath. 
 Khalim was sure Kalah had sent one of 
Her angels, Queen Kailya was, without a doubt, the most beautiful woman he had ever seen. The young mage had always enjoyed older women, from the time he had first been given a much older pleasure slave. Farouk enjoyed his slaves young and feisty, Khalim preferred maturity and a keen mind. 
 �Kalah writes your beauty in the stars.� He whispered entranced, his lips kissed her hand gently sucking the skin. 
 Farouk raised an eyebrow at his brother�s flattering comment, Kalah wrote of only the most beautiful women of legends in the sky, it was a high compliment. 
 Queen Kailya blushed, his intense brown eyes met hers and lingered. 
 �Thank you, Lord.� She finally found her royal voice. 
 �Just General, Kahlim El Nazra and this is my brother General Farouk El 
Nazra your majesty.� 
 Kailya found herself smiling. 
 �Shall we sit.� Valdis broke the magic, 
Kailya�s smile didn�t drop but her fingernails dug into her palms. 
 �Princess Chandra.� Farouk bowed slightly by the table before sitting. 
 Chandra eyes threw back daggers, General and he looked in even better shape than when they last met. The princess had not told her mother, four years ago, when she was a rebellious youth trying her hardest to run away from her mother�s crown, she had signed up for a Kavarach mercenary camp. Young warriors from all over the land attended to learn the ways of the adepts. There were Skaadi Northmen and Thuulian hunters and one single ebon skinned warrior from Kalish. The westerners had treated him with suspicion but the young warrior was talented and dedicated so was grudgingly shown respect.� As a recently announced maiden, Chandra had found herself drawn to his magnetic presence. Late one night by the fire place their passion had ignited, he was the first man she had ever kissed. She had run from her feelings that night, scared to surrender herself to another. She lost her virginity to a cavalry 
captian the next winter after a meaningless night of celebration. Chandra gulped as his brown eyes swept her inside, instinctively she could tell his feelings hadn�t changed. 
 �I think he is making eyes at you sister, the goddess alone knows why.� Her sister�s haughty voiced brought her back to reality. 
 Chandra frowned annoyed as usual. Her sister was only one year older than her but the two were constantly fighting. It wasn�t her sarcastic words, Chandra had long ago become immune to her sister�s spite, 
it was the obvious tension that their mother was trying to avoid. Queen Kailya shot her eldest daughter a dirty look before sitting down and smiling at the ambassador. 
 There was no argument, Princess Anjelica�s was the most beautiful woman in Galandria. Many a diplomat commented she had the face of an angel, that was until she opened her mouth. It brought Queen Kailya much sadness to admit that her first daughter, the surprise joy of her new marriage to Beren was a bitter, capricious and vain creature who cared about nobody other than herself. She had her mother�s long blonde hair and well sized bosom but with her father�s high cheek bones, aristocratic fine nose and deep green 
eyes, she was a heavenly creature with the heart of the damned. Currently the selfish princess was searching for a rich yet very pliable husband to pander to her demanding whims. 

The party settled down to an uneasy silence. Queen Kailya had attended royal banquets since she was a young maiden and could start conversation with the reserved Skaadi northmen. She started talking aimlessly, about the crop and the next Kavarach ball, luckily General Khalim was a well educated man and politely held conversation with her.

The ambassador said nothing, his eyes oogling first her daughter Anjelica and more alarming her youngest daughter Gemma.

"It appears our conversation bores you, Ambassador Kareef." She finally had enough.

He looked at the Queen, but not before leering on last time at the young white dressed maiden.

"Your youngest daughter wears white, is she a virgin?" he swirled his glass of wine.

Kailya and Khalim's polite conversation ground to a halt and the mother of three's face darkened.

"Not that it is of any concern to you Ambassador but yes my daughter will find a kind loving man to make her a woman." She said pointedly.

Kareef laughed and annoyed waved a servant away.

"Good, then we can negotiate how much to break her virginity." He said casually.

Khalim glared annoyed at the ambassador, he had seen nothing but strength and pride from the Galadrians, yes they were infidels but they would quickly learn to love Kalah.

Queen Kailya slammed her fist down her eyes flashing thunder, Gemma turned whiter than a sheet, her sister Anjelica laughed mockingly.

"Ambassador! You are a guest in my kingdom, I expect you to act like one. My daughter like my kingdom is not for sale!" she tried to keep as calm as possible.

Kareef smiled, goading the Queen had been most enjoyable.

"My apologies Queen Kailya, you westerners misunderstand our culture. I was merely asking if your daughter had a dowry." He said smoothly.

Queen Kailya glared, knowing full well what he had meant.

"But since you wish to talk about the price for your kingdom. The Sultan of Kalish, the Great Mubarak Bin Lal Fadeen has an offer."

The queen calmed herself down, the ambassador had purposefully provoked her to leave her off guard for the real issue.

"Very well, I am ready to hear it."

Kind Valdis glared at his wife, soon "beloved" soon, the arrival of the Sultan and his army had raised interesting possibilities.

The ambassador drank some more wine, his eyes again fixated on the young and still blushing princess.

"Princess Anjelica is well renowned at the most beautiful women in this godless kingdom. The Sultan's demand is simple. Your daughter agrees to be his twelfth wife and live inside his harem in Sherazad. In exchange for your homage he mercifully agrees to a peace treaty"

"What!" Anjelica stood her face livid.

"Is this some kind of joke? No black skinned beast is putting his hands on me! I am worth far more than your filthy Sultan's twelfth wife." She spat out.

"You Kalishite's disgust me!" she turned imperiously and stormed away from the dinner table."

"My daughter is right, a poor choice of words but my kingdom is not for sale. If the Sultan's men put a foot on my territory I will not hesitate to condemn it as an act of war. This conversation is over, thank you ambassador.".

Kareef's eyes flamed as he watched the arrogant bitch walk off, he pushed his chair away and shook his head.

"Unwise infidel, soon you will learn, the Sultan is no man to say no to." He stormed off.

"Excuse me mother, I have no stomach for politics." Chandra glared at Farouk before leaving the table.

The black warrior admired her tight ass and toned figure as she stalked off. 
 He turned to his brother Khalim smiled and moved his head. 
 �Kalah grant you favour my brother.� He said in their native tongue. 
 Khalim turned back to the Queen. 
 �
My apologies for my daughter�s badly chosen words General Khalim.�. Kailya tried to mend bridges. 
 He smiled broadly, 
 �It is not you who should apologise Queen Kailya, not everyone appreciates our culture.
�. 
 �What is that Khalim? A brutal regime which takes pleasure out of enslaving it so called �infidel� neighbours?� 
Valdis sneered. 
 Khalim smiled back, causing the slight build king to squirm in his chair. 
 �I do not expect you to understand, please excuse me.� He bowed to Queen Kailya before leaving the table. 
 �What exactly was that?� Kailya turned angrily on her husband. 
 Valdis waved his hand dismissively. 
 �I have no time for Kalishite threats, shall we adjourn to the study?� he smiled suggestively making Kailya shake with anger. 
 She smiled back tersely, 
 �Yes husband, lets.� Her hands touched the bundle of contracts in her pocket. 
 Gemma followed her mother and new father to the study, her cheeks still flushed from the ambassador comments. She shivered thinking about the disgusting man. But would a man make her a woman? 
 Her eldest sister was at the 
balcony, she glared annoyed at her mother and swept a contemptuous look over her youngest sister. 
 Gemma gulped but decided to speak to her, her mother was angry with her new husband again and she didn�t need to be a mind reader to know they were going to fight again. 
 �Ah, the ambassador, he looked at me, hungrily.� Gemma lightly touched her throat. 
 �Don�t make me laugh.� He sister turned with a sneer. �He wanted to fuck you silly.� 
 Gemma gasped at the crude language, her sister�s smile grew. 
 �You look so prim and proper sister but wait until he finds out you�re a disgusting freak.� 
 Tears started forming in the young maiden�s eyes. 
 �No nobleman is going to want to touch you when the truth comes out, you�re a freak sister, you know what adepts are used for?� her sister continued, enjoying the misery she was inflicting. 
 �I am not a freak.� Gemma sobbed, her sister smiled and leaned forward. 
 �Adepts are treated like whores, only good for buggering in their tight assholes, filthy freak.� Her sister spat venom. 
 Gemma�s tears flooded, she turned and fled wailing. 
 Anjelica watched with a sick smile. 
&nbsp; �Should I light the fire your majesties?� their seneschal asked. 
 �Yes it�s a cold 
night, here you can use these, that�s all they�re good for.� Kailya handed the contracts over. 
 Valdis�s eyes narrowed and he gripped his glass of wine. 
 His wife smiled at him, reclaiming her dominance. 
 The newly crowned king watched as his contracts were set alight. 
 �Unwise beloved
 unwise.� he spat before storming out. 
 A few minutes later Gemma burst into the room from the balcony. 
 �What is wrong honey?� Kailya asked, instantly forgetting her scheming husband. 
 �I�m a freak!� Gemma wailed before fleeing into the castle. 
 The mother of three stormed onto the balcony. 
 �What did you say to your sister?� 
 Anjelica turned with the most innocent expression. 
 �Nothing mother.� 
 Kailya frowned and shook her head, 
 �You are such a disappointment 
Anjelica.� before turning her back and walking after her youngest child. 
 ����������������������������������� *��������������������������������� *
��������������������������������� * 
 Khalim walked down to the garden and shook his head, war would come to this godless land, it was Kalah�s will. He lifted his head and followed the sound of a woman crying. Queen 
Kailya�s youngest daughter was sobbing by the fountain. 
 �What is wrong princess? A young woman such as yourself should never shed such desperate tears.
�. 
 Gemma looked up startled, 
 �I shouldn�t be talking to you.� 
 Khalim smiled, 
 �And why is that little one?� 
 �Because mother says you are a hungry wolf sniffing for blood.� 
 The 
Kalishite laughed softly and sat down, unperturbed. 
 �Your mother is a wise and amazing woman and you should respect her. The problem is your people demonise wolfs, but they are a predator like any other.� 
 �My people have respect for the desert wolf, you see the wolf is a necessary part of 
Kalah�s will, yes they attack caravans and kill livestock but like any creature they only do it because they must eat.� 
 Gemma nodded, not quite understanding the intense foreigner. 
 �Now why does such a young flower cry?� he asked gently. 
 The princess dabbed her cheeks. 
 �My sister, I, I am not like others.� She finally said dejectedly. 
 Kahlim smiled and slowly nodded, knowing all too well the rejection he faced as a young boy. 
 �You are a beautiful maiden who will make some man very lucky. The desert flower that blossoms after the rain, it is not ugly because it is different, 
no it is beautiful because it is different.� 
 Gemma looked up and smiled at the stranger, there was intensity to him that Gemma had only seen in her sister Chandra�s eyes. 
 �Gemma! There you are, come inside or you will get a cold.� Queen Kailya marched up to them. 
 The princess smiled at the strange black man before standing. 
 �Thank you Lord Khalim, you are a very wise wolf and have made me feel much better.� Gemma smiled, bowing slightly. 
 Khalim opened his hands and smiled. 
 �Take care young princess, obey your mother and Kalah will watch over you.� 
 �Gemma I will escort you inside, good evening General.� Queen Kailya was not sure how the black skinned Kalishite had won over her youngest daughter but her instincts as an overprotective mother kicked in. 
 The young princess smiled, with some mischief at Khalim, 
 �Thank you mother, but I am sure I can find my own way into the castle, if you would show the General the way back?� She said with an innocent look. 
 Queen Kailya raised her eyebrow at her daughter�s meddling. Princess Gemma cocked her head with a naughty smile to her mom before skipping off. 
 Kailya watched her youngest leave and then raised an eyebrow at her guest. 
 �Please Queen Kailya, since you believe me to be a wolf sniffing for blood.
�, Kailya blushed a little. 
 �Perhaps you would consider sharing a drink with this wolf to allow him to show you our people are not that different.� 
 Kailya paused before smiling a little, he was bold and charming. 
 �Very well general, since I have indirectly slighted you, one drink.� 
 Khalim smiled back and tried not to imagine the Queen in a dancer�s costume. 
 ����������������������������������� *��������������������� *
��������������������� * 
 Kailya found her initial anger dissolving, Khalim paused to admire the roses and ask which her favourite was. The queen blushed at the very straightforward intentions of the young Kalishite, but found 
herself very flattered. 
 She paused at the door to the 
study, Khalim touched his forehead in a silent prayer before gliding in. He looked over his shoulder and smiled, beckoning with his hands. 
 Queen Kailya hadn�t felt the heady rush of the hunt in 
years, she casually walked past him, trying to stop her eyes from deciding if he was as well muscled as in her dream. 
 �You are very sure of yourself General.� She turned with two glasses. 
 �I cannot remember ever having a drink with a Kalashite, is it against your religion?
�. 
 Khalim laughed, 
 �No, Queen Kailya, an often misunderstood law of Kalah. A servant of Kalah does not consume fruit of vine in public for fear of losing their tongue and dignity. That said, a faithful of Kalah may partake in the company of a woman he trusts.
�. 
 Kailya raised an eyebrow but turned and poured a glass of sweet white wine. 
 �You place a lot of trust in me General, do I have to remind you we are on opposites sides of a war?� she handed him the wine, his eyes holding hers in comfortable silence. 
 �You are a special woman Queen Kailya and Kalah has allowed me a glimpse of your soul, I would know more. As for the Sultan,� 
Khalim spreads his hands wide, �The Sultan is the voice of Kalah, she has declared this continent full of infidels, I am just the Sultan�s right hand, a wolf earning his meat.� he said with a disarming grin. 
 Kailya smiled back, annoyed that she was finding herself enjoying the black 
Kalashite�s company. 
 �Do you play?� Khalim asked gesturing to a set out board of King�s Champion. 
 �I, ah, it has been many years, but yes.� Kailya answered with a small smile. 
 �Excellent.� Khalim finished his wine and cast a spell, the black marble pieces shaped and twisted as if clay 
in a potters hands. 
 �Impressive magic, you are a sorcerer?� The Queen asked the question she already knew the answer to. 
 Khalim bowed slightly, the black marble pieces had changed from their standard western pieces of footmen, knights, towers and bishops to the eastern pieces, Mamaluks, Farii, 
Dome shaped siege towers and Speakers of the True Faith. 
 �The Shai-ir recognised my talent at a young age, my brother chose the sword, I chose the book.
�. 
 Kailya nodded impressed, there was no doubting the adepts self confidence, she had only recently pierced his pattern, a strong, complex series of interlinking silver 
threads, he was a powerful and accomplished mage. 
 �In my land, beautiful woman must always go first.� He conceded with a magnanimous bow. 
 It took three moves for Khalim to stop grinning, Queen Kailya was no novice, 
this board was definitely not for show, though rusty is showed a remarkable intellect, something Khalim was eager to test. 
 �Something wrong general?� she asked innocently. 
 Khalim clapped his hands laughing, he extended his glass and the Queen refilled it, she hated the way he was making her feel, alive. 
 �Well played Queen Kailya, yes you are no novice, excellent, I am have been looking forward to this all evening.
�. 
 Queen Kailya furrowed in concentration as Khalim began to build a series of complex moves, each move the start of another strategy. 
 Suddenly after a few footmen and 
mamaluks had been deposited beside the board Khalim pointed down and opened his hands. 
 �You see? You westerners are preoccupied with your Queens.� 

�She is the most powerful piece in the game, someone to be respected.� Kailya pushed her point. 
 Khalim smile didn�t slip, he was up to something. 
 �Yes strong and powerful but isolated, too proud to accept help.� He pointed to the board, no white piece of any power was near the Queen, 
she was surrounded by footmen. 
 He then pointed to his side of the board, the sensuously sculptured figurine of a woman who looked suspiciously like Kailya stood next to a fierce looking amir who looked a little like Khalim.� 
�My Sultana? Yes she is a strong and capable woman and respectful of her Amir but at the same time invaluable to him.� 
 Kailya gulped as the conversation took a serious note and she was sure Khalim was no longer talking about King�s Champion. 
 �But she sits in her 
tower, my Queen is on the battlefield, amongst her subjects, a woman of action, see reinforcements are not far away.� She motioned across the board, to her two knights attacking his siege towers, two could play this game. 
 Khalim confident smile still did not slip, quickly Kailya checked the board, a cold chill making her gulp, 
she hadn�t even seen it. 
 The young mage smiled as his adversary�s finally saw his diversion. 
 �Yes not far, but too far to prevent her downfall, while my speakers kept her busy, my 
faris has slipped in.� He moved the knight piece from behind a wall of footmen. Khalim exchanged the pieces in a deft move before gently kissing the white queen. 
 �Khalim, please stop.� Kailya fled to the window, running from her own feelings. 
 She gripped the cold stone balcony and took a deep breath, not for the first time in her life cursing her heavy crown. Kailya felt Khalim silently join her outside. 
 �You take you jest too far General.� She whispered in the night wind. 
 �Jest? Why your majesty? Because you feel the same way? I do not play with your feelings 
Kailya.� 
 She shivered as he used her name, she looked up, 
by the goddess she wanted to lay her chest in his arms. 
 �I can understand you 
concerns my desert bloom, but my heart is true.� 
 �How Khalim, we have just met!� she spat out angry because he was the first man since her dead husband she had ever felt connected to. 
 �Yes, but in 
Khalah�s eyes a second is the same as a lifetime, I know inside you have a beautiful soul. In your western culture I wish to put a ring on your finger.� 
 �Thank you General but as you can see I already 
have one.� Her anger continued to rage. 
 Khalim took a step forward, 
 �You do not love him, this crown, weighs heavy on your beautiful head.� He reached up and deftly removed it. 
 Kailya turned furious, 
 �How dare you!� she turned full of misplaced anger. 
 Khalim stepped in and kissed her. 
 The Queen of Galandria eyes widened before her body took over, it was a revolt. 
 Her eyes closed and her lips eagerly locked with his, his body pressed against her, his hands playing with her hair, running down her back. 
Kailya�s hands defied her mind and roamed his strong shoulders enjoying the hard muscles. 
 Khalim�s hips bumped hers against the balustrade, Kailya groaned her eyes closed, she could feel his hunger, almost taste his need, he wanted to take her to her bed and make mad passionate love all night long. Goddess it felt good to be needed in such a carnal way. 
 Somehow to the Queen it felt like her crown had magically lifted off the cold stone where Khalim had left it and placed itself firmly on her head. The responsibilities of state and motherhood crashed her erotic 
escape, she had duty and people relying on her. 
 She broke the kiss, gently pushing him away. 
 �Khalim we cannot do this.� Her mind whispered, but her body was crying out in protest. 
 �Why? Do you not want me?� he asked, not willing to back down. 
 Kailya gulped and shook her head. 
 �No, you are the first man I have wanted to take to my bed in many years.� The words tumbled off her rebellious tongue. 
 �Then stop fighting it my angel.� He stepped into her and Kailya was powerless to stop her desire. 
 Their first kiss had been powerful, their second was explosive. The Queen of Galandria could no longer deny herself, her hands ran through his hair and down his back, she moaned in his mouth as he gripped her ass, squeezing the wide cheeks. Khalim broke the kiss and started sucking her pale neck. 
 �Oh Khalim.� Kailya whispered as his hips pushed hers against the stone railing, his hungry mouth kissing down to her large breasts. His hands had left her ass and were quickly travelling up her stomach to meet his mouth at their lusty target. 
 The blonde queen nibbled her lip, her hands playing with his hair. This was it, the moment of truth, if he suckled her breasts she would be unable to stop herself and he would spend the night in her bed. The older Queen felt something very large and hard bump against her inner thigh. A moan escaped her lips as she imagined his size, she so desperately wanted it, to feel a strong, handsome man thrust inside her again. Again her crown found its unwanted way onto her head, she was the Queen of Galandria and he was her enemy, she was a white woman, he was a black man, she was the mother of three and he was younger than 
Anjelica. It was wrong, as much as her body wanted it, she could not allow herself to take it. 
 Finally Kailya�s mind reigned in her over sexed body. She lifted 
Khalim�s head up with her hands, without looking in his eyes she buried her head in his shoulder, refusing to allow herself to shed a tear. 
 �Please Khalim we can�t, please do not make this harder than it is for me.
�. 
 Khalim sighed and gently lifted her head, the black mage smiled tenderly before kissing her red lips. 
 �If I take you to my bed, I do not think I will have the courage to tell you to leave in the morning and you must.� She squeezed his hands. 
 Khalim opened his mouth and she gently touched his lips. 
 �Please, I have not fallen so heavily for a man, I feel what you are talking about, but Khalim, it can never be. As much as I sometimes regret it, I am the Queen of Galandria and you are the Sultan�s right hand, very shortly I fear we will be at war and no amount of praying will change that. Thank you, I am truly flattered and in another life, I could let myself fall for a much younger man. But fate is not being kind to us and I have a country to defend.� 
 Her eyes hardened, she squeezed his shoulders once more before picking up her crown. 
 Khalim tried again but she shook her head before fleeing the study with as much grace and poise as she could muster. 
 He watched his beautiful Queen flee; the mage sighed and raised his face to the moon with a sad smile. 
 �I am sorry Kalah, I tried but her mind is full of duty and pride.� He looked at the small white queen figurine he had taken from the board. The mage flicked his black fingers, the sculpture changed, her crown was gone and a collar surrounded her neck. He kissed it, �I will protect you despite your pride my beautiful angel and teach you 
Kalah�s love.�

 The tall black warrior followed Chandra�s tight ass as she stormed through the castle. Several servants looked at him surprised but the man exuded such self assuredness that nobody stopped to question him. 
 Farouk waited as the object of his desire entered the royal wing, he had a suspicion from her angry mutterings that she was going to use his favourite method of calming down, exercise. 
 As he suspected Chandra emerged sometime later dressed in practise armour and marched down to the training hall. Farouk slowly followed his prey enjoying the sway of her 
ass, she had swept her hair into a tight pony and wore black boots. 
 Chandra had just started practising when Farouk entered the hall. She glared at him but motioned for the quartermaster to leave her. 
 �How dare you!� the fiery princess fired the first salvo. 
 Farouk smiled bathing in her 
anger, she was possibly even more sexy when she was angry. 
 �Dare what?� 
 �Come here! 
Now, after all these years.� 
 �It is 
Kalah�s will that we meet again.� 
 �Don�t bring your goddess into this. You never contacted me.� Chandra said hurt. 
 Farouk spread his hands, 
 �If I remember correctly it was you who ran away from me that night.� 
 �We were young and confused and, you never chased after me, I never saw you again.� Chandra turned her confusion into aggression. 
 Annoyingly the black 
Kalashite laughed. 
 �Kalashite men do not chase after woman, though I have never forgotten you or that firey spirit my storm chaser.
�. 
 Chandra 
gulped, he had called her that the night of their passion. 
 �Do not call me that, and besides who says I am interested.� Chandra flicked her hair haughtily. 
 The 
Kalashite laughed again and walked over to the rack, he kicked off his silk slippers before removing his shirt. 
 The brunette princess had to admit, the 
Kalashite was in perfect condition, powerful muscles rippled across his back, she felt the same desire that had left her panting all those years ago, stubbornly the colonel repressed her feelings, he was the enemy, a man who had left her and never chased after her. 
 �What are you doing?� she asked a little frightened by her raging feelings. 
 He picked up a wooden sword, 
 �You are here to practise? Then lets practise.
�. 
 Chandra paused, 
 �How do I know this isn�t some kind of elaborate assassination?� 
 Farouk grinned and casually tested the sword out. 
 �On my word, I will not hurt you.� He said seriously. 
 Chandra smiled and flicked her sword, eager to show this 
Kalashite her post in the army was not brought with her mother�s influence. 
 �Princess.� The quartermaster said concerned from the edge of the training mat. 
 �It�s alright 
Gidern, its just practice.� She matched Farouk�s smile. 
 The black warrior let his fiery opponent attack, casually blocking her strikes, appraising her skill. 
 Chandra�s confidence was shaken a little as he continued to circle her, deflecting her blows, his smile never slipping. 
 A particularly well aimed strike glanced off Farouk shoulder and the General began to counter attack. Chandra blocked his strikes but a sweat began to line her brow, he was good, very good, much better than her quartermaster. 
 �Resistance is futile my storm chaser, surrender to me, open your heart.� 
 �Never!� Chandra spat back, the adrenalin coursing through her veins. 
 Farouk laughed his sword speaking for him. 
 The combatants clashed for sometime before Farouk decided to end it. Chandra blocked a strike and riposted but her opponent had anticipated the move, his sword quickly striking her practice sword, the wooden weapon flying across the mat. 
 Chandra gulped, the quartermaster drew his sword. 
 �Leave us, I wish to speak to the princess.� Farouk said unconcerned. 
 �Please 
Girdern.� Chandra panted her brunette eyes never leaving the black warrior�s. 
 �As you wish your highness.� The quartermaster sheafed his sword and motioned to the servants. 
 �Now what do you intend to do with me?� The princess challenged. 
 Farouk bowed slightly and flipped his sword, offering her the hilt, as Chandra reached for it he gracefully held her wrist. 
 �I, ah let go of me.� Chandra 
said, the four years apart disappeared in a heart beat and she was back around the fireplace, his lips close to hers. 
 �Why? You feel the same as I, Kalah allows me to see it in your eyes.
�. 
 �I am not the child you met four years ago.
�. 
 �No you are a brave and strong woman, I will never hurt you and worship your every step.� Farouk said seriously, he reached into the pockets of his pants and produced a strip of black and gold silk. Chandra�s eyes widened as he wrapped it around his wrist and extended his hand. She only vaguely knew the customs of the 
Kalashite�s but the proposal of marriage was well known. 
 �Take my hand 
Chandra, I never forgot about you, it is you who has inspired me to become the man I am. Take my hand and we will be unstoppable, Kalah will shower us with her blessings. All you have to do is take my hand and be my beloved.� 
 The princess of Galandria paused like a deer caught by a hunter. In the end her legs answered for her tumbling mouth. 
 Farouk watched sadly as she fled the training mat and shook his head.

 Kailya only slowed down outside the royal wing and straightened her dress. 
 �So, tell me everything.� An excited voice ambushed her as she entered their lounge. 
 Queen Kailya cursed, Gemma uncurled from the couch and rushed over giggling excitedly. 
 �Nothing happened.� Kailya innocently defended herself; she frowned as sounds of loud voices wafted in from 
Anjelica�s quarters. 
 Gemma joined her mother in a frown, 
 �Anjelica is entertaining again, ugh her friends are such bitches.
�. 
 �And Chandra?� Kailya asked eager to steer the conversation away from her. 
 Gemma shrugged, �She stormed into the lounge before barricading herself in her room.� 
 Kailya nodded knowingly, Chandra had inherited her husband�s penchant for brooding 
 �But, stop changing the subject mom.� He daughter raised as stern an eyebrow as she could muster. 
 �Come on, tell me, I saw the look in your eyes and you were gone three hours, come on, tell me, tell me!� she dragged her mother to the sofa. 
 �Gemma, nothing happened.� her mother said as straight faced as possible, she could still feel 
Khalim�s lips on hers and her heart was still racing. 
 Her youngest daughter raised an eyebrow. 
 �I am sure you told me a noblewoman never lies?� 
 �Gemma, that�s different and you are too young.� 
 �Mother, you yourself said I am a maiden so tell me.� The young princess said frustrated 
 The Queen sighed and fussed with her daughter�s straight blond hair. 
 �Very well, we had a drink.� 
 �And�� Gemma pushed. 
 Kailya sighed, 
 �And we kissed.� 
 �Way to go mom, so what�s the next step.� Gemma said excitedly. 
 �Gemma, there is no next 
step, I shouldn�t have even kissed him. I am married to your father.� Kailya said angry at herself. 
 �Oh mother, you are fooling nobody, you treat me like a child but we all know the guilds pressured you into marrying him and the two of you are always fighting. But 
Khalim�� Gemma grinned mischievously. 
 �Can never be, please Gemma drop it, for your mother, okay? Now let Cherie put you to bed, it is long past your bedtime. � Kailya gently hugged her before leaving for her own lonely bed.

 The 
Shai-ir mage walked slowly back to the guest quarters. Farouk was pacing annoyed. 
 �She said no?� his brother asked the obvious. 
 �Too proud and independent.� His brother swirled a mug of coffee. He turned and smiled at his twin. �But by 
Kalah�s will she will be a perfect pleasure slave.� 
 Khalim grinned back, �Brother you did not tell me her mother was touched by Kalah.
�. 
 Farouk forgot his gloom and clasped his brother on the shoulder. 
 �It is good to see you interested in a woman more than a book brother! Yes, the Queen is well 
curved, those massive udders would fetch at least four rings alone.� 
 �It is not just her body brother, though I cannot wait to suck on those breasts! She has a mind Farouk, keen and sharp, she will be a perfect First slave.
�. 
 �Slow down there! We must first battle their army, then capture their capital, then convince the Sultan to give them to us and then they need to accept 
Kalah�s love before we can talk of First slaves.� 
 Khalim smile did not drop he sighed happily, 
 He caressed the white queen in his pocket, �The board is set brother, 
it is just a matter of time now.�

Now onto the nasty sex, some more action than the first, the Sultan&#8217;s humiliation might not be for everyone (M/f, nc, inter, rape, humil, bdsm)

Chapter 2 : The fall of Galandria

The next day Kailya threw herself into the mountain of paperwork she had to sign, her father had never explained to her how many times she would have to sign and seal decrees! The Queen frowned and stroked her signet ring, thinking about her parents always made her sad. They had been assassinated just two years after Kailya had married the man of her dreams, the young queen was forced to ascend the throne to bring stability to her kingdom. Kailya&#8217;s nails scratched the desk, though she had no proof, she had always suspected the guilds were somehow responsible. Thankfully Beren had been a strong rock she could lean on, his charisma and leadership skills had banded the Galandrian&#8217;s behind their new Queen and King. 

Kailya tried very hard not to think about Khalim as her morning passed on. About lunch time Captain Beleris entered looking more serious than usual.

The knight bowed low, �Your majesty I can understand the need to show the Kalashites our strength but my conscious demanded I beg you to find another way.�

Queen Kailya put her pen down, �What are you talking about captain?�.

Beleris gulped a little,

�The ambush of the ambassador and his guard, the troops prepare to leave for the north portal as we speak.�

�What! I requested no such thing.�

�My apologies Queen Kailya, King Valdis spoke to our order this morning, he said it was your wishes.�

Kailya growled her temper rising.

�Cancel the ambush Captain, thank you.�

Beleris bowed gratefully and left.

�Where is Valdis?� She pounced on her seneschal in the corridor.

�He is sitting down to eat lunch with your daughters, your majesty, I was coming to inform you.� He called out as his queen thundered off.

Kailya stormed into the royal wing and onto the balcony.

Gemma smiled at her mom and then gulped , finding her yogurt very appetising.

�When exactly did I give the order to assassinate Ambassador Kareef?� Kailya started as calmly as possible. She thought about telling her daughters to leave but decided she had to show Valdis she was not afraid of him.

Chandra looked up surprised, Gemma paled.

�But my beloved, surely you are not going to let the ambassador threaten us like that, these Kalashite&#8217;s need to be put in their place.�

�I did not give the order!� Kailya thumped the table.

�But my love, it is what you wanted, isn&#8217;t it? For the good of the kingdom?� Valdis replied calmly.

Kailya took a deep breath, Valdis had obviously sensed something had happened last night and was taking petty revenge.

�But mother, you can&#8217;t! It&#8217;s wrong!� 

Anjelica laughed coldly at her younger sister, �That is why a runt like you will never be Queen, you are soft and weak sister, the throne takes a will of steel. I think it&#8217;s a great idea, slaughter them like the beasts they are.�

�Anjelica, do not talk to your sister like that!� Kailya said angrily, her eldest just smiled, sipping her juice.

�Assassinating the ambassador will achieve nothing. The Sultan would have already received your poor choice of words, Anjelica.� Kailya&#8217;s eyes flashed at her eldest.

�What about his generals? They have practically won the Sultan&#8217;s campaign in the dutchies. You do want them dead, don&#8217;t you?� Valdis continued, turning the dagger in his wifes chest, that would show the bitch for whoring herself to the Kalashites.

Chandra looked up at her mother, the two looked at each other for sometime. Kailya fought a new wave of emotions as she was forced to think of Khalim. She cleared her mind and thought logically.

�Killing the generals would be as pointless, the Sultan would merely promote within his army, besides they are powerful adepts and not easily slain. It would prove too high a cost even if our knights were successful, don&#8217;t you agree beloved?� she fought back.

Valdis glared at her logic before leaving the table. Anjelica stormed off in a huff, 
Gemma smiled happily at her mother and sister.

* &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;* &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*

Near evening a small contingent of Galadrian mages escorted a stunningly beautiful, light brown skinned woman to the Queen. Kailya had left her magical past behind her but she could feel magic flowing off her. She flicked her eyes into astral, as she suspected a magical creature. The woman had deep green eyes, kissable red lips and high cheek bones. A sparkling string of diamonds wrapped around her long black hair creating a bun before dropping the black hair to one side. The queen took one look at her body, dusky features and the woman&#8217;s see through veil and knew who sent her. A silver top barely concealed her large tanned breasts, her stomach was bare and well toned.&nbsp; Her see through pants revealed curvy hips and a firm wide ass. The creature wore high diamond encrusted slippers, balancing gracefully on miniscule heels. 

Her guest flicked her hair and huffed, her eyes roamed over Kailya.

�I don&#8217;t see what all the fuss is about, master has gone mad.�, she muttered.

�Silence, demon.� One of the mages snapped.

The creature rolled her eyes and crossed her arms.

�Our apologies your majesty, this thing was found sneaking through the city, please be careful, she is a genie, a creature of trickery created by the power hungry Shai-ir of Kalish.�

The genie looked at the archmage in disbelief and huffed again.

Kailya smiled at the wizard&#8217;s prejudice.

Her own adept powers had developed at a young age, even younger than Gemma&#8217;s. Her parents understood the hardship it would bring their only daughter but also the dangers sitting on the throne brought. Finally it was decided the young girl would be tutored in private. A tutor was hired and Kailya was schooled in the Galadrian&#8217;s tradition of sorcery. It was kept a secret for the princess&#8217; protection, only her husband had known of his wife&#8217;s adept powers. That was a long time ago and Kailya had not studied the art in many years now. 

�It&#8217;s alright magister, this genie is it dangerous?�

�Only to fools.� The creature spat darkly.

�Silence your deceptive tongue! Lest I summon the nine damnations of Akabar!� the magister threatened.

The genie glared at him before raising her nose in disdain.

�What does it want?� Kailya decided to carry on playing stupid.

The creature&#8217;s eyes lit up.

�Well somebody has half a brain in this unholy land. Yes I have a message from my master, listen to it so I can leave.� She said primly.

�Careful your majesty, it could be a trap.� The mages cautioned.

Kailya waved her hand,

�Let her speak.�

�Finally, I really do not understand why your surround yourself with these fools. My name is Mushira Ashara Lal Kadeem second daughter of the Amir of Nadakazar and twenty second in line to the Silver Throne.� She paused waiting for the queen to acknowledge her title.

Kailya tilted her head slightly and the creature continued.

�My master commanded me to deliver these to you, he said you would understand and Kalah would guide your heart. Really the clouds in this land are turning his brain to soup. Take these, as gifts from him.� She reached into her pockets.

The four mages raised their hands, spells at the ready.

Khalim&#8217;s genie raised her eyes to the ceiling muttering in a strange language before revealing a small black parcel and a letter. She put them on the ground and clapped her hands. Before the mages could move the genie streaked to the window and jumped out. An eagles cry announced the creatures new form as it began flying east.

* &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;* &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*

Queen Kailya stood by the balcony watching her daughter&#8217;s unit cross the courtyard; she could not lift the feeling of dread that griped her throat. 

She looked down angrily at the note in her hand and nibbled her lip. 

The silk parcel was a carefully wrapped figurine, a King&#8217;s Champion white queen, without a crown. In flowing script on the letter was a simple message, Open when the Sultan invades. Kailya did not have to wait long. Two short weeks after hearing her daughter refusal, the Sultan&#8217;s army of Kalah invaded Galandria, the countries border defenses were quickly overwhelmed and the army began a straight march for the capital. With shaking hands Kailya had opened the letter. She looked down again; it was Khalim&#8217;s sincerity that struck her.



Dear Kailya

With heavy hands I write this letter, I am sure the Sultan will not take your daughter&#8217;s rejection well and I will be forced to raise my hand against your country. Please understand, it is not a task I wish, but a task I must excel at, Kalah demands no less. We will rapidly approach your capital, before meeting your army, do not worry, Farouk prays daily for Chandra&#8217;s safety. We will be victorious, please do not consider it boasting, I write so because our hearts are pure and full of Kalah&#8217;s love. Before we siege the capital I pray Kalah helps you see the truth, you must escort your daughters to Thuul, we will not attack there for sometime. Please go with them, I write this though I know you will not. The Sultan enjoys humiliating his opponents and your daughters will be his tool, they must not fall into his hands. If the Sultan takes you alive, I am conflicted, I want to hold you again, but I understand if you must take your life to avoid the Sultan&#8217;s fate, it will bring you much honour in Kalah&#8217;s eyes. I pray you choose to live, once the Sultan tires of you, I will ask he gives you to me, I have yet to take reward for this campaign and I will never meet such a beautiful, intelligent woman ever again. Stay strong, bend to the Sultan&#8217;s will, resistance will only bring discipline and live. He tires quickly then I will take you and care for you my flower. This will be difficult for you to read, but you must do as I say, save your daughters and if your pride requires it stand tall against the Sultan, I will come for you.

Kailya had shouted, screamed, crumpled the note into a small ball and thrown it across the room. Somehow it had found its way into her pocket. She had a bitter fight with Chandra. Her headstrong daughter had plainly told her mother that her unit was joining the main army to meet the Kalashites on the Merrypuddle plains. Both women had landed up screaming at each other, Kailya forbid it, Chandra accused her of controlling her life. The fight had ended with door slamming.

Kailya angrily wiped a tear away, Queen&#8217;s do not cry in public. She fought the urge to mount up a horse and ride after the column, to tell her daughter one last time she loved her. Stubbornly she wrapped her fingers around the balustrade, her eyes following the light infantry marching through the town. She would not because she would see her daughter again, the Galandrian army would be triumphant, her knights were renowned as the best fighting unit across the continent, they would show these black skinned demons. She looked up, Kailya had never been a particularly religious person, the Galandrians followed Nustress one of the old goddesses, she hadn&#8217;t visited the cathedral in years but a prayer found its way onto her lips.

The Queen opened her eyes again and stared at the letter in her hand. She may be proud and stubborn but she agreed with him, her daughters must not fall into the Sultan&#8217;s hands. Kailya tried not to think about Chandra, she had placed one of her children in Nustresses hands, she would not tempt fate with her remaining two.&nbsp; Even now Captian Beleris was making ready to escort her two daughters through the escape tunnels to the royal airship and on to Thuul. Kailya had thought about what Khalim had said, she would stay and fight the Sultan, if her meagre defenders could just hold out until reinforcements arrived. The other countries would aid her, it was in their best interest to see the Sultan defeated, the Kalshites were obviously not content with their foothold on the continent. But that would not be necessary, she had briefly spoken via magic mirror with the other rulers and everybody agreed to wait until the Galandrian army had tested the Fist of Kalah. Her army would be victorious, they had to be.

* &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;* &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*

Chandra shifted uncomfortably, the summer heat was blazing down and even in her magically cooled armour she was still sweating. The army was heading for the Silvercreek portal, about a day&#8217;s travel from the capital. From there they would activate the rune gateway and travel to their far east portal, near the Merrypuddle plains. The princess looked around, she looked up on the hills and frowned, she didn&#8217;t remember such a large forest in the valley, she used to ride through the area often with her father. Impulsively she left the column and rode Starr to closer to the start of the strange forest.

The princess angrily shook her head, what was she doing? It was the fight with her mother distracting her, they had not left on good terms and she was feeling bad. Stellia her shield bearer had dropped the colonel&#8217;s sword and Chandra had flown into a rage almost drawing blood with her crop. It wasn&#8217;t poor Stellia&#8217;s fault, the young adept was trying, Chandra had to clear her head, they were heading into battle and she needed to be focused. The colonel took one last look at the forest line, the way the wind was blowing through the trees, it was hypnotic, she berated herself again for lacking focus before spurring her horse on, back to the marching army. 

�That was too close, I thought you said nobody would look twice at your magical forest witch?� The Sultan&#8217;s Right Hand lowered her hand, the adept archers lowered their bows. The Hyissian witch turned on the black haired woman. 

�My magic is very powerful and will distract a peasant easily but that is Princess Chandra, a colonel in the army and a strong adept. I did not think her mother would allow her to join the army.�

�So that is princess Chandra, how do you know this witch?�

The Hyissian smiled at her blind apprentices,

�I also have my spies Kalahshite.�, she said secretively.


* &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;* &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*


Kailya put down her pen and rubbed her tired eyes, it had been two long days. Finally this evening General Kalver had informed her by magic mirror that the Kalahshite army was waiting for them on the Merrypuddle plains and they would engage them at dawn. The Queen took a deep breath and for the hundred time tonight tried to push her fear for her daughter&#8217;s safety out of her mind. Chandra was in the goddesses hands now, Kailya had to be ready. She stood up and walked around her study, it was early in the morning and she hadn&#8217;t slept at all. Whatever she did, the mother of three could not shake the feeling of dread. She calmed herself down and sat down again, resolutely picking up her pen. At least Valdis had been scarce tonight, she had been fighting with him constantly since the ambassador&#8217;s visit and it was draining her. As much as Kailya hated the thought, she would have to speak to Cardinal Mirschadal when all this was over and petition the goddess for a divorce. She balled her fists, she would not be threatened by the guilds any more.

Her daughter&#8217;s scream propelled her into action; she jumped out the chair and rushed for the door. She found her two daughters dressed in their nightgowns in the passage. Gemma was crying uncontrollably and for the first time in a long time her eldest daughter Anjelica look afraid. 

�What&#8217;s wrong honey.� Gemma flew into her arms.

�The city, mother, it&#8217;s burning.� Anjelica whispered.

�What do you mean?� their mother asked, her hands shaking.

�Mother I woke up with a bad dream and went to the window, it&#8217;s burning!� Gemma wailed.

Kailya took her two daughters by the hand and dragged them back into the study, she burst through the doors to the balcony and stopped.

�By the goddess.� She whispered.

�What does it mean mother?� Anjelica asked shaken.

Kailya scanned the horizon, one of the fires was definitely the cities barracks, and another looked like the mage&#8217;s tower. Her lips were dry, even from here she could here the sounds of people screaming on the streets, a large contingent of horse riders had gathered in the square, making for the castle gates, though far in the distance Kailya picked up their shirtless black skins.

�It means we have been betrayed.�

�Milady, I came as quickly as I heard.�

Kailya turned relieved as her ever present seneschal entered.

�Morris please take Anjelica and Gemma down to the cellars, Captian Beleris will meet them there.� The serious knight had discussed what to do if there was an emergency, Kailya had been amused but entertained him, she now thanked his cautious mind.

�But mom, what about you! You&#8217;re coming with us.� Gemma started her voice rising scared.

�Take them Morris now, I must raise the guard.� 

Kailya tried to stop her hands from shaking; she went to her desk and opened her bottom brawer, carefully wrapped inside red satin were her magical bracers of protection, the ones she never expected to ever have to wear.

She had just picked them up, trying very hard to ignore Gemma&#8217;s pleading when a whistling sound followed by a sickening thud and then her daughter&#8217;s screams jarred her. Morris, her faithful seneschal stumbled towards her, he fell to the ground, a crossbow bolt lodged deep in his chest. It all happened quickly, two large men pounced on her daughter&#8217;s at the doorway, grabbing them by their hair, dagger&#8217;s at their white throats. 

Kailya raised her hands but her blood ran cold, 

Valdis entered carrying a crossbow. He kicked the fallen seneschal.

�Always wanted to do that old man.� He smirked.

The Queen turned on her husband furiously,

He shook his head,

�What ever you are going to do beloved, stop or pretty Gemma&#8217;s blood will soak the carpet.

�You bastard!� Kailya spat out. 

She eyed the large men, they had firm grips on their daggers, even if she could animate them, Valdis was carrying a crossbow and she doubted she had enough magic to turn all three weapons aside.

�My dear wife such language and in front of your daughters. You&#8217;ll pay for that slut, gods hear me, you&#8217;ll pay, but not by my hand, beloved, the Sultan wants you unharmed, I hear he is something of a monster in bed.� He smirked.

Kailya gulped and prayed the guard would come and find her.

�The castle is secured and under guild control, Captian Beleris never saw the dagger in his back. We will just wait here until your new master arrives.� Valdis smiled smugly.

The Queen fought her despair and focused her anger.

�Traitor!�

Valdis just smiled.

�Who me? No my dear, you are the traitor for not showing the guilds, the true power in this country their due respect. The Sultan&#8217;s invasion was the perfect opportunity for Galandrian&#8217;s true power to emerge. These Kalashites are fools, you know all he wanted was their pick of Galandria&#8217;s women. Hah! With the countries coffers I can buy an entire harem! Oh he wants to parade you around Sherazad before selling you at their slave market, I fear your pain has just begun, dear wife. He has graciously promised your daughters to me.� Her step father turned with undisguised lust on a terrified Gemma.

�I&#8217;ll ask him to let you watch as I rape my dear step daughter.�

�Coward! Leave her alone.� Kailya&#8217;s eyes narrowed and she took a step forward.

Valdis shook his head and aimed his crossbow.

�Get on your knees whore, now.� He barked. 

Kailya balled her fists before Gemma cried out, the dagger touching the young maiden&#8217;s throat. Her eyes blazing with fury, Kailya knelt.

�Good slave.� He smirked before locking her wrists in manacles.

�Now let&#8217;s go to your bedroom dear, you know the one you never let me enter, the Sultan has requested you present yourself like a queen before he disgraces you.�

The helpless Queen glared back praying to the goddess Valdis was bluffing.

The three women were roughly herded into Kailya&#8217;s quarters.

Valdis tossed his crossbow to one of the mercenaries and flung his wife&#8217;s closet open.

�There are too many dresses bitch, where is that sluttly one, the dress you whored for the Kalashite&#8217;s, the one your fat tits were falling out?�.

Kailya glared at him, Valdis had always been loathsome, now he was plain disgusting, the dress was in her storage closet, wracked with guilt, the queen had moved it after Khalim had left.

�I sent it to the cleaners, now let us go.�

Valdis laughed loudly, rummaging through the large closet, he pulled out a blue dress and threw it at her.

�Strip and put it on.�

�Never!�

�I won&#8217;t ask twice fucking bitch.� Valdis spat angrily, he walked up and grabbed Anjelica by her long blonde hair.

�Leave her!� Kailya fought back.

Valdis ran a dagger up his hostage&#8217;s side, playing with the princess&#8217;s nightgown.

The Galadrian queen tried to disintegrate her husband with her eyes or at least hope this was all a very bad dream. Finally she began to undress.

�Take a good look men, soon the slut will be fetching a good price at the whore house.�

Kailya eyes never left her traitorous husband, the mercenaries eyes lusting over her body.

Valdis smiled, the satin blue dress was low cut, showing the Queen&#8217;s magnificent breasts and gathered around her waist before flowing over her wide ass.

�Perfect, you should have open your legs to me beloved , now you are just a piece of flesh for the filthy Kalashites.�

�Nustress take you to hell.� Kailya spat back.

�Not likely, you will be surprised at how much absolution a country&#8217;s coffers can bring. Now the heels and then the makeup, come on whore we don&#8217;t have all night, or should I begin entertaining myself with pretty Gemma?� he smiled at the young princess, Gemma paled at the suggestion.

�Leave her alone.� Kailya growled, she eyed the mercenaries, they were openly oogling her body but their knives had not lowered and two crossbows were still pointing at her.

Valdis snapped the manacles back on his wife and groped her breasts, Kailya stared back defiantly.

�You will never get away with this.�

�Oh yes I will, the Kalashites pay a fortune for beautiful white skin, pity I had to bargain you away, I would so enjoyed beating you into submission myself.�

Kailya dugs her nails into her hands and glared at her molester.

�Come whores.� Valdis pushed Kailya towards the door.

The mercenaries brought the three women to Anjelica&#8217;s bedroom.

Valdis threw her a tight fitting golden ball gown.

Anjelica didn&#8217;t move.

The traitor king walked up to her and viciously slapped the princess, sending her flying.

�Stop it, leave her alone!!� Kailya cried out fighting as one of the mercenaries held her arm.

Valdis grabbed his step daughter by the hair.

�Fucking bitch, I have seen the way you look down at me. Your sister is going to be chained to my bed and fulfil my every wish. Your hot ass I am going to chain to the dungeon walls and you can scream for you dinner every night.� Valdis laughed with the dutchy mercenaries.

�Now get dressed or I will give you your first whipping, first of many slave trust me.� Valdis patted a riding crop against his leg.

�Anjelica, just do what he says.�

�Good whore, now listen to your mother and strip nice and slowly.� Valdis smiled as he sat down enjoying the show.

The mercenaries whistled as the first princess was forced to strip in front of them.

�Check out that ass.�

�No Brorn, those tits, a man can suck them all day.�

�Come on sugar, spread those pussy lips.� The three laughed.

Anjelica glared at her step father before picking up the silken fabric and stepping into her dress.

�Come on slut, help your sister.� Valdis barked at Gemma.

With shaking fingers Gemma helped her sister into the tight dress and high golden slippers.

The three women were finally pushed into Gemma&#8217;s room.

�Strip nice and slowly step daughter, you are going to spend the next few years satisfying my cock, so put on a good show.�.

�No, stop it now, not Gemma, leave her alone.� Kailya fought in her manacles.

�I didn&#8217;t see you fight when they ordered me to strip, mother.� Anjelica spat at her mother.

�Gag these sluts.� Valdis ordered.

The mercenaries grabbed Kailya and roughly pushed a pair of Gemma&#8217;s panties into her mouth, Kailya fought bitterly but the large men were too strong.

�Now start stripping.�

Gemma looked tearfully at her mother, Kailya was still fighting the two men.

�Do it now whore! Your mother can no longer save you from my hard cock, now get busy!� he screamed.

Kailya watched disgusted as her husbands rampant erection pushed through his pants.

�No, please let us go.� Gemma pleaded.

Valdis cracked the riding crop on the pink side table.

�No? A slave never says no, I am going to have to beat your training into you.� He took a step forward, Gemma stepped back, her face whiter than a sheet.

Kailya jumped in the men&#8217;s arms.

�Got a real fighter here milord, needs a good gang bang.�

�Not until the Sultan has seen her, he was very insistent. Now my slave start stripping or I don&#8217;t care what the Sultan wants, I will whip that tight ass black and blue.�

Gemma looked at her mother, tears running down her face, Kailya nodded. The young princess looked embarrassed at the three mercenaries.

�Please, please, make them turn around.� She pleaded.

Valdis laughed,

�Stop stalling slave, I want to see those perfect tits.�

Gemma blushed deep red, she took one more tearful look at her gagged mother.

Kailya&#8217;s heart broke, she was not sure how but she would have her revenge on her husband for his act of treachery.

�Strip!� Valdis barked again.

The blonde princess closed her eyes and dropped her nightgown.

The mercenaries wolf whistled,

�Look at those tits!�

�You could crack nuts with those ass cheeks!�

�Yes, you will do nicely.� Valdis purred, stroking his hardon.

�Please some clothes.� Gemma wailed miserably.

Valdis stopped, thinking for a moment, Kailya felt a cold shiver run through her, thankfully his face changed. He stood and walked over to her cupboard, enjoying Gemma&#8217;s sobbing. He found the ball gown and threw it to his step daughter.

�Get dressed daughter, have you no pride! Stripping like a common harlot! Put some clothes on.� He mocked her, Kailya continued futilely struggling as her youngest daughter burst into fresh tears.

Gemma quickly put on the white ball gown, the same she had worn for dinner with the Kalashite ambassador. Kailya nodded bravely, encouraging with her eyes.

Anjelica was pushed forward and pulled the laces at the back of Gemma&#8217;s gown tight causing the young girl to yelp, her eldest sister smirked in her makeshift gag before pushing Gemma&#8217;s feet into silver high heels.

Finally all three women were marched off, in manacles to the throne room. Kailya was surprised to see her servants had been herded into the room and several of the nobles from the nearby estates were standing, looking shocked and dazed. Most of the men had been beaten, they stood naked, their hands bound behind their backs. The women had all been dressed for a ball but were unharmed.

Several black soldiers stared at the queen with undisguised lust.

Kailya felt her hands become sweaty and her throat dry, she had heard of them and seen pictures but the Sultan&#8217;s Sardukar were even more intimidating up front. They were his elite bodyguard and shock troops, strong, tough and mean. Their massive muscular bodies were covered in strange red tattoos of protection and obedience. Several by the door were armed with curved scimitars and rune covered staves but most were armed only with wooden canes which they freely used on anyone who disobeyed.

The Queen was prodded onto the red carpet before her throne, where she would stand to greet dignitaries. 

�Stay close to me Gemma, everything is going to be okay.� Kaliya said soothingly. 

One of the mercenaries raised his hand, Kailya calmly stared him down. She recognised them now, Silver Dutchie mercenaries and silently cursed herself. Just last week her seneschal had delivered a report from the town guard that a large number of mercenaries had been seen in the taverns, Valdis had �admitted� to hiring them to bolster the town guard but wanted to keep it quiet, she had been such a fool for not seeing his treachery.

As the time went by the room filled with more and more of her disposed court, the Sultan had been supplied with very accurate information and any man or woman of importance in the kingdom was herded into the room in chains. Some hours went by, the prisoners were forced to stand by the brutal Sardakaur. Valdis entered with three guild masters, Kailya&#8217;s eye blazed across the room, begging her magic to break her bonds so she could throttle her idiot husband. The head of the steel guild, the harvest guild and the tavern guild laughed at their former queen&#8217;s helpless rage, the three bowed mockingly before lusting at Gemma and Angelica.

�Valdis you are a fool, the Sultan will never share power with you. Keryen I expected you, but Dernen, how could you?� Kailya accused the jovial Tavern guildmaster, the fat man ducked her accusing eyes behind the tall steel guildmaster.

�Silence slave.� One of the Sadarkaur raised his cane.

�No it&#8217;s alright Sadarkaur, I want her to hear everything.� The head of the steel guild commanded the tattooed warrior.

�Queen Kailya, you look radiant this morning.� He mockingly complimented her, the other two laughed. The three guildmasters stared hungrily at Kailya&#8217;s breasts, her hands manacled behind her back, she was powerless to stop them.

�Keryen you are a fool for trusting the Sultan, he will not share power, please give up this madness.� 

The guildmaster smile dropped and he reached forward to slap her, Kailya stood tall, the Sardakaur caught the smaller man&#8217;s hand.

�Unharmed.� He growled at the guild master.

�Fine, the bitch will get what is coming, as Valdis was saying the most beautiful women in the land is a small price to pay for free reign over your country. You know I thought my predecessor&#8217;s plan to kill your parents would end your reign but that fool Beren was more charismatic that we thought.�

�You bastards! Nustress help me I will strike you down.� Kailya roared in rage.

The Sadakaur pushed the guildmaster away and lowered his cane touching Kailya&#8217;s chest.

�Silence slave, the Sultan will teach you respect for Kalah.�

The guildmaster glared at the Sultan&#8217;s warrior before laughing at the queen, the four men sauntered to one corner of the room.

�Mother, I&#8217;m scared.� Gemma whispered.

�It&#8217;s okay honey, just stay close and everything is going to be alright.� Kailya tried to convince herself, her hands still shaking.

Some more time passed before there was commotion at the door, the double doors were thrown open and a slightly built man in golden chainmail armour entered, on his head a sparkling turban, next to him a tall brown skinned woman dressed in a leather cuirass, Kailya&#8217;s eyes instantly noticed some kind of whip in her hands.

The Sultan of Kalah strode purposefully towards the queen.

�Is this her?� he looked Kailya over and then her daughters.

The woman nodded.

He turned back and spat at the Queen&#8217;s feet.

Kailya gulped, trying to calm her shaking hands.

�She looks like a whore in a dress. Get on your knees whore and kiss your master&#8217;s feet.� He extended one of his dusty riding boots.

The Queen of Galandria looked around, very aware of her two precious daughters next to her. She swallowed her pride and fell to her knees, kissing his boot.

The Sultan sneered and kicked her away.

�You are not worthy of Kalah&#8217;s forgiveness.� He turned to the assembled crowd.

�Kalah has declared your people unfaithful, not fit to serve her as devout worshippers, only fit to be her slaves.� The crowd gasped, several women broke into tears. 

The woman standing next to the Sultan cracked her whip, the crowd instantly fell silent.

�This is what happens to those who dare defy the will of Kalah.� 

Kailya felt strong hands grab her, hauling her to her feet. The Sardakaur ripped her blue dress from her body, Kailya suppressed a sob as she was disgraced in front of her court. The Sultan smiled and reached forward groping the Queen&#8217;s large breasts, Kailya glared defiant as he fondled her. The sultan greedily mashed her large mounds, tugging on her sensitive nipples, smiling at the defiant infidel as they hardened from his attention.

�Very nice udders whore and already hard nipples, you will make a lusty fucktoy what do you think Jarzia?�

Jarzia had long black hair tied in a severe pony, her eyes were deep brown but they made Kaiyla shivered, they were cold and merciless. She had a beautiful body, toned and atheletic with a well sized bosom.

The woman looked over the queen with a critical eye.

�She has potential, Kalah has blessed us with sellable flesh.�

�Hear that whore, your udders will fetch a good price at my slave market but first I will show you slaves what happens to those who defy the Will of Kalah.�, he laughed at the furious queen before grabbing her by the shoulders and exchanging places with her, her roughly turned the half naked queen around so she was facing her shocked court.

Kailya bit her lip as her subjects stared at her naked body. The Sultan reached behind and jiggled her breasts.

�What do you think men? Is this whore fuckable?�

The queen blushed as the Sardakaur roared with approval, several showed her their tounge, obscenely kissing air, worse some pulled down their loose pants revealing massive erections. Kailya was horrified that the female Sardakaur gripped their crotches and beckoned to her.

The soldiers behind the disgraced queen checked her heavy manacles before nodding to their leader, the ruler of Sherazad walked around slowly, his soldiers quietened down.

Suddenly the black man slapped Kailya, her head jerked from the vicious blow, the soldiers threw her onto the throne room floor.

She had heard the reports, the Queen of Galandria knew what was going to happen and she desperately hoped they wouldn&#8217;t make her little baby watch.

�Mom! What are you doing? Please let her go!� Gemma suddenly said her concern for her mother outweighing her fear.

The Sultan turned on her and smiled,

�Ah yes, the young virgin.� He motioned and his Sardakaur ripped her white dress from her body. 

Gemma cried out fearfully, the soldiers held her hands as she tried to cover up her nakedness.

The Sultan smile faded and was replaced with lust, he grabbed her face in his hand.

�Slaves do not speak unless commanded to; you will learn to respect your master and mistresses.� He caressed her alabaster cheeks making Gemma shiver in fear, she gasped as his rough hands fondled her perfect breasts. �Such beautiful flesh and a virgin, I think I will take you for myself. What do you think Jarzia?�

�Beautiful Sultan, she will be a perfect fucktoy when I am finished with her.�

�No! Leave her alone, I beg you, take me but please spare my baby.� Kailya cried out, from the floor.

The Sultan turned to his slave trainer �Make sure the virgin watches, I want her to see everything, she closes her eyes cane her until she opens them.� He ordered Jarzia ina cold voice.

Gemma felt the soldiers tighten their grip on her arms. The black haired woman walked behind her, running her hands up the tight white dress.

�No please, don&#8217;t make Gemma watch.� Kailya tried to plead with the black ruler.

The Sultan smiled before dropping his pants.

Kailya gulped, the Voice of Kalah was an impressive six inches long and his black manhood was easily wider than her dead husbands.

On her back, naked and defenceless, the matriarch tried to futilely back away but her assailant grabbed her hips, pulling her towards his large cock, he slapped her again before roughly ramming his cock into her tight pussy.

�Tight slut! Haven&#8217;t been fucked in awhile? We can cure that, soon you will be begging for Kalashite cocks!� the Sultan panted as he thrust deep inside the blonde queen.

�Watch closely and learn slave.� The slave trainer whispered in Gemma&#8217;s ear.

�Please make him stop.� Gemma felt tears fall down her face as her mother was brutally raped, horrified but morbidly fascinated, the young maiden watch the Sultan&#8217;s black cock plunge in and out of her mother&#8217;s ravaged womanhood.

�You have never seen one before?� Jarzia laughed in her ear. �Don&#8217;t worry, the Sultan won&#8217;t fuck you for months, he&#8217;s still busy with his little jungle bitch and your infidel brethren we enslaved in the Silver Dutchies. Until then your sweet pussy is mine.� The slave trainer menaced, licking the young maiden&#8217;s ear.

�Please, he&#8217;s hurting her, please make him stop.� Gemma closed her eyes trying to escape the nightmare.

She cried out in pain as the slave trainer crop lashed her pale behind.

�Watch little whore, watch everything, your mother is going to live in a world of pain from now on and you will join her unless you obey my every perverted command.� Jarzia menaced before sucking her ear.

The Queen of Galandria refused to give him the satisfaction of her tears and just stared angrily as he violated her. 

Her silent defiance obviously annoyed the Sultan and he began slapping her between his thrusts.

�Fucking whore, you like that don&#8217;t you bitch?� He began twisting her nipples and mauling her large breasts.

�Beast, coward!� she spat back.

The enraged Sultan slapped her several more times before grabbing her hips, he groaned loudly pounding her pussy hard.

Kailya looked away as the monster howled in orgasm, his filthy seed flooding her bruised pussy.

He pulled out and used her hair to clean his dick, he spat on her again.

�Hang this slut up, I want to show my new slaves what happen if they don&#8217;t obey Kalah&#8217;s decrees.�

The two Sardakaur grabbed Kailya and pulled her towards the centre of the room. The mother of three steeled herself, the soldiers had hung two sets of rope from the ceiling, at first she thought they were going to hang her but she feared they had something much worse in mind. She pushed the terrifying feeling out of her mind as she felt the sultan&#8217;s copious seed run out of her violated womanhood and streak down her thighs, she had to be strong, she had to stop her tears from flowing, for her babies.

A strangely beautiful woman dressed in a black dress watched from the one wall, she was tanned instead of black like the Kalashites, with full red lips and a voluptuous body. Some large, half naked black man attended her.

The Sultan look over the defiled queen with contempt before casually walking undeterred by his nakedness over to the shocked Gemma, he could see her terrified eyes focus on his flaccid cock. 

�Watch slave, you will learn quickly from Jarzia or she will make you scream. She is my royal slave trainer, the best in the land, yes you will make a perfect cocksucker.�

Gemma face paled as the Sultan&#8217;s eyes roamed her body, the young maiden&#8217;s face transfixed on her mother&#8217;s back. 

�Jarzia make that worthless white slut scream, I want all this white whores to see what happens to those who defy Kalah&#8217;s Will.�

The young princess shook her head fearfully as she watched the slave trainer walk over to her mother, her high heeled boots clicking on the marble floor. Jarzia unfurled her whip and cracked it in the air.

Kailya jumped at the sound behind her, she was facing her shocked court, determined not to show any weakness. 

The guildmaster&#8217;s walked around the room to better watch the spectacle; Valdis toasted a glass of wine to his wife.

�See my beloved you refused to let me in your pussy, how did your new master feel? You are such a frigid bitch, I&#8217;ll bet he&#8217;ll sell you to his whore houses within a month!!!� he laughed mockingly.

Jarzia grabbed Kailya&#8217;s ass and squeezed, she ran her whip around the queen&#8217;s body so Kailya could see it.

It was a strange looking whip, long strips of leather about the width of a dagger each were bound into a handle.

�Ever seen one of these before slave? We call it the Kiss of Kalah, it&#8217;s a slave whip, don&#8217;t want to draw blood do we? Ever been whipped? I didn&#8217;t think so; you westerners are so pathetically weak. It will hurt like nothing you have ever felt before. Best get used to it bitch, Kalashite owners beat their infidel slaves all the time. Please feel free to cry.� Jarzia bit the queen&#8217;s shoulder before laughing taking a few steps back.

Kailya prepared herself, there was a whistling sound and her back exploded in pain. Her parents had never even raised a hand against her, she managed to stifle her cry of pain but the whip kept flying through the air. Gemma watched horrified as her mother was whipped, the young maiden eyes transfixed with terror as the sadist swung back and forth.

After ten lashes Kailya broke down,

�Please no more, please.� She wailed.

Jarzia smiled and simply increased her pace,

�That&#8217;s it, slave beg for mercy.� She spat out.

Kailya&#8217;s body shook from each blow, her fierce pride obliterated by the intense pain, she screamed, begged, pleaded for the sadist to stop. Jarzia&#8217;s whip left wide red strips along the matriach&#8217;s back, across her thighs and her plump ass.

Something snapped inside Gemma, 

�Let my mother go, now.� She softly whispered. 

The sultan turned, his lip twitched and he motioned, two of his soldiers held Gemma&#8217;s arms.

�You are brave little one, but such insolence must be punished. Jarzia whip the whore&#8217;s breasts twenty lashes, I want to show my newest fucktoy what happens to those that defy me. If she does not count, whip her mother twice.�

Gemma shook her head,

�Please no, please let her go.�

Jarzia walked around and pulled Kailya&#8217;s hair forcing her head up, the tears were running down the matriarch&#8217;s face.

�Hear that slave? Your daughter has earned you your first breast whipping, if you thought the back was painful, just wait until you feel this.� She slapped Kailya and slowly walked away.

�No, goddess, please no more.� Kailya begged.

The Sultan watched Gemma&#8217;s face,

�I will not tell you twice slave, count everyone one your mother&#8217;s lashes or Jarzia will give her two.�, his eyes&#8217;s daggers daring the virgin&#8217;s defiance.

Gemma snapped, her eyes burnt into the Sultan,

�Let my mother go now.� She whispered.

The Sultan&#8217;s motioned with his hand.

�Add another ten lashes.� He ordered.

It happened suddenly, Gemma felt a beautiful heat radiate from her chest. A magical force picked up Jarzia and threw her across the room. Thr soldiers let go as the young maiden&#8217;s body erupted in azure flames. The sultan took a step back, he gulped and motioned to his guards, the young girl&#8217;s blonde hair blew in a magical breeze, her body rose off the ground, levitating several inches.

�Now!� Gemma screamed.

�She&#8217;s an adept, kill her!� the Sultan said panicky.

�No, leave her alone, I beg you.!� Kailya managed to plead through the pain in her back.

Gemma felt her rage focus, the black soldiers had drawn their swords and were cautiously approaching but the young maiden could only see the Sultan. She had never truly been angry in her life before, never considered actually killing somebody, but for one second she could imagine a magical force snapping the Sultan&#8217;s neck and deep down inside she knew she could do it. Suddenly the amazing heat in her chest was snuffed, her azure flames died down and she sank back to the floor. Gemma&#8217;s gasped for air, it felt like somebody had ripped the air from her lungs.

Kailya watched the black dressed woman weave magic, she opened her hand a small ball of energy appeared, she flung it across the room, behind the hanging queen, the sorceress raised her hand and beckoned with her fingers. She caught something in her hand and raised it to her lips.

The sorceress breathed the new adept&#8217;s magic in, sweet, pure, strong. She strode across the room, the Sardakaur reluctantly making way for her.

�Out of the way!� she commanded. 

She ignored the Sultan and took the gasping adept by the shoulder, shaking her.

�Breathe child, breathe!� she urged her, �You lungs were full of magic, now breathe!�

Gemma took a deep breath; she looked dazed and confused before fainting. The sorceress&#8217; spirit warrior caught the unconscious girl.

�You Kalashites are such barbarians, have you never seen an awakening before? Hyissa has blessed this one with great power.� she reached out and caressed the young princesses face her eyes twinkling. �And great beauty, she will be perfect.�

�What are you talking about witch? She is my newest slave who I will personally beat into submission.� The Sultan appeared from behind one of his Sardakaur.

The witch turned on the Sultan&#8217; ignoring the armed soldiers.

�No longer, I am taking this one as payment for my services.�, she said imperiously.

�Do not make demands from me witch, your Black Circle has been well paid for its services.�

The sorceress gently stroked Gemma&#8217;s arm examining the young maiden.

�Gold, what do I care for Kalashite gold. You have paid the circle and now you pay me. This one is worth more than all of your gold and I am taking her.�

The Sultan crossed his arms, �Kalah finds your lack of respect, disappointing.�, his Sardarkaur raised their swords.

The witch rested a hand on her massive spirit warrior&#8217;s ebon arm.

�Tell me Sultan, have you ever heard of the essence of the Black Will plant?�

The Sultan&#8217;s men approached, the witch didn&#8217;t look impressed.

�We had a wonderful meal last night didn&#8217;t we Sultan? Jarzia really can cook, I remember you commenting on the unique flavour.�, the witch smiled evilly.

�You are bluffing witch, my Sardakaur personally taste my food and detect poisons, I am not that stupid to travel with a Hyissian bitch and not take precautions.�

The Hyissian laughed undeterred.

�Ah yes your Sha-air and then demons, they lack the subtlety of our spirits. While you were planning your treacherous attack, my apprentices slipped Black Will into the pot. It&#8217;s a very specific poison, triggered by a simple command word.� She smiled.

�You lie, kill the witch.�, he commanded.

His soldiers advanced, the witch sighed and clicked her fingers, the four Sardarkaur instantly clutched their throats falling to the floor, writhing in wordless agony. The Sultan gulped and touched his throat. The witch smiled again.

�Now I will be leaving tonight, see that I am not disturbed.� Her spirit warrior picked up the blonde haired girl and slumped her over his shoulder.

She walked past the stunned crowd.

�My baby, where are you taking her?� Kailya asked, tears in her eyes.

The woman walked up to her new slave&#8217;s mother,

�This will be difficult to accept but she is mine now.�

�No, no, please not Gemma, she is so young and innocent.� 

The woman smiled,

�We will speak later; the Sultan is not finished with you.�

She left the sobbing queen.

Jarzia walked up to the Sultan, the Voice of Kalah was furious.

�That fucking bitch, give me that and clean up this mess.� He kicked one of the dead Sardakaur before grabbing the slave whip.

Kailya screamed as the Sultan swung the whip, her red back exploding in fresh pain. 

Anjelica who up until now had been very quiet hoping the Sultan would somehow forget her refusal felt hands grab her ass.

�You don&#8217;t think he&#8217;s forgotten have you slave?� Jarzia laughed from behind her. �He wanted you to watch all of it before he makes you pay, you think your mother is suffering? Wait until he&#8217;s finished with you.� Anjelica gulped and her flawless features paled.

Thankfully the Sultan tired quickly and motioned to his guard.

Kailya was cut down, she collapsed on the floor sobbing. 

�Please mercy, no more, please.� She begged.

The Sultan grabbed her by the hair.

�You think I am finished with you slave? Your precious youngest daughter is gone, and I have defiled your infidel womb but I left your eldest daughter for last.� He smiled evilly as Kailya stopped crying and started shaking her head.

�No, not Anjelica, she didn&#8217;t mean it, please.�

The Sultan turned,

�Please who?� he tested.

The Queen of Galandria swallowed her shattered pride.

�Please master.�

�Louder! I want the whole room to hear.�

Kailya suppressed a sob,

�Please master, spare my daughter.� She begged.

The Sultan just smiled and turned his back, 

�No!� Kailya wailed as the Sardakaur hauled her to her feet.

�If that whore says another word, twenty lashes to all the pleasure slaves.� The Sultan took the slave whip and flicked it through the air. Anjelica paled, the black conqueror motioned and her golden dress was ripped from her body. 

�Ah Sultan, your majesty, I can explain, I have friends and can give you much power.� The eldest princess started. 

The Sardaukaur wordlessly attached shackles to her ankles, a short iron chain running between them. They then unlocked her manacles before reattaching them in front, running another chain from the manacles to the shackles on her ankles. They nodded and took a step back.

�Sultan, please, what I said, it was a misunderstanding, I am ready to marry you now.� the beautiful blond pleaded, the sultan&#8217;s eyes narrowed and he advanced.

Kailya shook her head helplessly as the conqueror stormed up to her daughter.

�Fucking whore!!!� the Sultan screamed, the whip whistled through the air.

Anjelica cried out as the leather strips struck her bare breasts, she fell to the floor.

He loomed over her.

�You stupid infidel slut, did you really think I was going to forget!!!!� he screamed at her.

Anjelica looked up in terror, shaking her head, pleading with the enraged man.

�No stuck up white infidel dares refuse my offer, this is what happens to those that insult me.� He swung the whip catching the princess on her thigh.

Anjelica wailed and tried to crawl away, but with her hands and feet shackled it was futile. 

�Crawl slut! Fucking crawl, like a bitch! You are not worthy to lick my dick cunt!� the Sultan swung the whip again and again in a rage.

�Mother please, make him stop please, Aaaah! Please!� Anjelica wailed, Kailya felt her broken heart shatter even more as her first born was brutally beaten.

Sultan whipped the princess around the room, he made sure all his new slaves witnessed what her arrogance had brought her. He laughed as she begged for mercy, trying helplessly to escape the slave whip.

Anjelica looked up at anyone, pleading for their help, the courtiers looked away. The first princess had always flaunted her station above her mother&#8217;s court, flirting with newly wedded men and looking down on their wives, teasing and mocking the members of the Galadrian court, Anjelica found little sympathy in their faces.

Jarzia eventually pinned the wailing princess to the throne floor with her boot as the Sultan whipped the princess&#8217; beautiful ass and back again and again.

Kailya felt her tears flow freely but she knew she could do nothing more than pray.

The Sultan put the whip down, Anjelica had passed out from her beating, he spat on before giving the slave whip back to Jarzia.

�Take her to her bedroom, you will use that whore&#8217;s room for grading?� the Sultan motioned at the Queen, Jarzia bowed.

�Send for a healer, I will make this piece of shit scream all night long before I pass Kalah&#8217;s judgement.�

A Sardarkaur walked up to his Sultan, bowed and whispered a message.

�Good, excellent timing Captain.� He walked over to the three guildmasters and King Valdis.

�Ah, Well met Sultan, I take it our mercenaries were able to secure the city for you?� Keryen smiled as a servant poured another glass of wine.

The black Kalashite ignored them, he threw a bag at the guildmaster&#8217;s bodyguard.

�Your commanders are dead, work for Kalah and live.� He said simply to the men.

Valdis&#8217;s face drained, he stood panic stricken as the Sardarkaur advanced on the men with their canes.

The mercenary captain looked inside the pouch of gems and pearls and nodded to his comrades, before falling on one knee.

�What is the meaning of this? We had a deal.� Keryen complained as the soldiers pulled his arms behind his back, snapping on manacles.

The Sultan sneered.

�Kalah does not make deals with traitors. Make sure they are sent to the mines commander, I want them worked to death, twenty hours a day.�.

�No, no, please Sultan, this must be some mistake.� Valdis said suddenly very scared.

The four men were hauled off, the Sardakaur canes used to silence their protests.

Kailya smiled just a little, Nustress had answered one of her prayers, she would not shed a tear for her traitorous husband. Her smiled faded as the four men were herded out, their treachery was complete, Galandria had fallen and even images of Valdis pushing mine carts under a slave driver&#8217;s whip would not change her fate.

The new ruler of Galandria turned to the slaves.

�You are all slaves, learn to serve Kalah and she may be merciful. Obey your commands instantly or suffer the consequences. Get these white whores out of my sight.�

He ordered something in the eastern tongue and the Sardakaur moved forward. Kailya watched as the clothes were ripped from the enslaved women, any man who fought in their bonds was beaten with the canes.
