Chapter 1

Maggie was a naughty girl. That is why she found herself chained to the wall of the dungeon hidden beneath the main floor of the Estate of the Count and Countess De la Fountaine. She was still wearing her mistress&#8217; black corset with pink lace and silk stockings. She felt the biting cold of the stone against her back even through the corset. Her nipples were hard and aching from the cold, at least that is what she told herself. She thought that she could feel the oppressive darkness more then any other sensation. It left her lost in her thoughts and the sensations of the shackles and cold. She cursed her stupidity and selfish lusts.
She had not been able to resist the temptation. She had known better. The rules where made clear to her and she had over time proven that she had understood them. She had done well in her position as a chambermaid largely due to the tutelage of Clarisse.&nbsp; 
Clarisse had served the Fontaine house for several years before Madeline or as she preferred Maggie was purchased. Clarisse was strong and quiet but had taken Maggie under her protective wing and helped her through the difficult transition from life as a daughter too life as a servant.
Sold to the Count and Countess La Fontaine at the age of twelve, Maggie&#8217;s parents were at risk of loosing everything, their home, their children, and even their own freedom. Selling their eldest daughter to the Count and Countess had assured them that the rest of the family would remain intact. The Fountaine house became their benefactors and thus assured the families survival.
Maggie had been trained first as a housemaid. The labors of the estate were difficult but she had learned hardships early in life. She was the oldest of three and as such had worked hard along side her mother to care for her family.&nbsp; 
It had been an unusual honor that the Countess had chosen such a young girl to be her personal chambermaid. Maggie had thought that it a reward of her hard labors. It brought with it some extra privileges, such as an upstairs bedroom that she shared with the Countess&#8217; two handmaids and a little more free time then the other servants. That was especially true when her mistress was away.
Bound shackled to the stone wall she blamed the free time for getting her there. The Count and Countess had left for the week. She had rushed to finish her daily chores in hopes of finding some time for herself. She was able to finish early and fled the daily routines of her day to take a bath at the bath house. Normally, she would have been limited to using the wash basin in her room and would have washed herself with a wash cloth. It was a special treat for her to be able to enjoy the luxury of being able to lounge in the heated water of the hot springs.
The springs where rare and had made the estate a popular place for the aristocracy to visit. Their visits created extra work for Maggie and the others. She pushed the thoughts of more labors aside as she relished the closest thing to freedom that she had been able to find since she had become a slave. She was actually a ward of the estate due to her parent&#8217;s inability to provide for all of the family. It was a nice way of saying slave. If she tried to leave, she would be beaten nearly to death or worse and her. The Count and countess would stop providing support for her family and they would all soon starve. Soaking in the warmth of the water and feeling the smoothness of her body in the water. She found her hands roaming over her breast and the sex. Her mind drifting away and loosing itself in the visions of wanton lust that the handmaid&#8217;s had painted for her. 
They painted pictures about the countess&#8217; fine cloths and her exploits in amour. She hoped that one day she would be able to become one of the countess&#8217; handmaids and secretly hoped that when she did she would be able to experience some of the things that she pictured from their stories. The fingers of her right hand began to make circles over her clit while the fingers of her left hand began to squeeze and pull on her hardened nipples. The excitement built in her slowly until she heard the sounds of approaching laughter. She stopped her indulgences and climbed from the tub. Pulling her nightgown over her head, she rushed back to the main house. Her nightgown clung to her wet body as she ran.
The thoughts and feeling that she had been exploring in the bathhouse stayed with her as she returned to her room. She lay down in the bed and slid her hand below her gown. Her mind returned to the stories that her roommates Cossette and Jacqueline had told her as they talked in the darkness of the night. A smile crossed her face as the idea entered her thoughts. She climbed off the bed, and reached for the candlestick on the nightstand before entering her mistress&#8217; bedroom.
She let her eyes and her mind explored the room as never before. She imagined herself as the Countess. She thought about what it would be like to be the mistress of the house. What would it be like to have been born into the world deserving the luxuries that surrounded her on a daily bases?
She knew that it was wrong to open her mistress&#8217; armoire, but in that moment she was the countess and it was all hers. She ran her fingers over the silk of the dresses and thrilled in the bright and beautiful colors of the dresses. Her fingers passed from the soft and supple fabrics to the hardness of a corset. The fabric was soft but it was the hardness of the whale bone sewn between the layers that sent a shiver through her. It was black with pick lace trim. The fabrics felt so fine, so soft, and the contrast of the pink against the black was stunning. She could feel her nipples getting hard. She looked over her shoulder at the empty room, hesitating for only a moment before she quickly began to undress. She carefully removed the corset from the armoire and stepped into it for the first time. She lifted into place around her frame and cinched it as tight as she could. The feel of the fabrics and the restraint of the whale bone began to stir her arousal even more and the heat in her sex began to build. It was so firm, so tight around her body. She could feel it forcing her to stand straighter. It make her already ample breasts seem even larger as she looked at herself in the large mirror in the corner of the room. She searched for the silk stocking that she had often pickup up from the floor and from the backs of the chairs. She carefully stretched them up her legs and clipped them to the corset. They felt exquisite against her skin.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Her sensitive nipples began to ache as the moisture built inside her again. The hunger had been building in her since her bath. Alone and free to be what ever she wanted to be, she choose to be the countess and she wouldn&#8217;t be denied. She stretched out on the bed, and began touching herself again trying to fulfill the desires coursing through her. She caressed her breasts and began to pull on her hardened nipples stretching them, and pinching them before starting the cycle again. She could smell her arousal filling the room, as she imagined that the touch was that of one of the countess&#8217; many lovers. Her words like her desires escaped her, �Ooooo....... oh .. yes.. mmmmm� She was lost in her own passions. The words and her moans freely escaped her lips as one hand continued to assault her breasts and nipples and the other slid over the silk outer fabric of the corset and massaged her sex. 
That was how the count&#8217;s governor found her. He had been passing the room when he her heard moans coming from the room. He walked the entire mansion nightly before retiring for the evening. He looked to review the work of the servants and planned the next day&#8217;s activities. This particular night was different in two ways. The travels of the Count and Countess had made it possible for him to reward some of his staff. It was also different in that he had been working with the stablemen in the later part of the evening and so had changed the path of his nightly inspections. 
He followed the sounds of her lust and watched her as she ministered to her own desires. She was as beautiful as he had imagined it.
He knew that she should have left her to the purity and innocence of her own youthful pleasures. The time wasn&#8217;t right. He started to step away and continue his nightly inspection but a part of him could not walk away. The countess would not forgive him and he was unwilling to live with the deception it would demand.
Even as a child, Madeline had her eyes, and even her demeanor. Now she was a woman. Every curve and movement of her body now reminded him of her. It was as if God had brought her back to him. 
He knew in his mind that she was Madeline a purchased slave, but his heart still wished that Plato could be right and that it was her re-incarnated.
It was a decision made in weakness and in the fullness of his humanity. A part of him knew that the deception would have been the honorable course of action.
He silently entered the countess&#8217;s room. She had made it too easy for him. His dark dreams now ready to be unleashed. He towered over her. He was tall by any standard and muscular from years of hard physical labor. Even his years as the governor of the La Fontaine estate had not diminished his strength. If anything, it had given a sense of power to his presence. 
�What in God&#8217;s name do you think you&#8217;re doing?� His voice was like thunder coming from nowhere and everywhere at once. Tinged with implied indignation it was clam, powerful and demanding. 
Her eyes flew open but her fingers refused to stop their relentless attack on her sex. She saw him towering over her. Looking almost god like as he stood with only the light of the candle casting his face in flickering shadows. Just as in nature lightning follows thunder, and she felt a surge of passion hit her driving her to the edge of an abyss that desperately wanted.
�Ohhhh.. gooooooooddddd,� Her voice a desperate scream. Her legs began to tremble as her body drove itself into her thrusting fingers. 
He grabbed her by the hair and pulled her up off the bed. He spun her around and threw her down again before pulling her wrist behind her back and driving her body in to the plush fabrics of her mistress&#8217; bed.
�You filthy little whore!� She heard his voice deep lustful and filled with anger.
�I could not help myself... pleeeeeeaaaaasssee..
She screamed out of fear and frustration as he pulled her up from the bed. One hand grasped her wrist and the other her hair as he forced her out of the room. Her body denied the bliss that she had been so close to obtaining.
�Oh.. Please.. I'm... sorry.. I couldn't help it....� 
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Shut up you little whore!� He growled and pushed her down the hallway and through the great hall. Clarisse watched as Maggie passed exposed like a street whore.
He released his grasp on her hair and fumbled with something unseen on the wall. A side door clicked open and he pushed in wide before pushed her through it. He pushed her against the wall face first and told her to stay still as he lit a torch and He grabbed a torch from the wall. She didn't notice and latter wouldn&#8217;t remember it happening. She was lost in the combination of fear and passion that surging through her with a force that she was had sent her mind and body spiraling out of control. She would only remember feeling the strength of his hands. Their strength bound her by her wrist and her hair. She would remember the feeling of her hair pulling against her flesh, the muskiness of his smell, and his towering over her with every step.
�Please.. Sir.. I .. I&#8217;m ... sorry.. please.� Maggie heard the words but it was as if someone else spoke them, her mind was still fighting the flood of sensations filling her body. She didn&#8217;t want mercy. She didn&#8217;t want forgiveness. She wanted to be taken. The person hidden inside her was in awe of the strength that had captured her, and lusted for more. 
She didn't even think to resist as the juices from her pussy dripped down her thighs. She simply moved where he guided her. Her body wanted to follow his lead. He took her down the winding stairwell to the dungeon as the smell of sulfur from the torch filled her nose. 
She fought to maintain her balance as he forced her down into the darkness. Unable to use her free hand to touch herself though she desperately wanted to.
When they reached the bottom of the stairway, he pushed her through a heavy unlocked door and threw her forward onto the floor. The silk stockings tore at the knees. He grabbed her by the hair again and pushed her back against the stone wall with a force that nearly drove the air from her lungs. She stood there dazed and unmoving as he put a manacle on each wrist, and then one on each ankle leaving her exposed and helpless against the wall.
He stepped away and soaked in the picture of her lust driven self. He had been rougher than he had intended. His passions and memories had thrown him onto a path that he had fought against until now. He stepped forward his hand snapping forward to grab hold of her pussy. His fingers parted her swollen lubricated lips and drove into her. He lifted her body from the floor impaling her on his hand and the fingers inside her.
�Hmmmm... please Sir.. oooo.. please...� The orgasm hit her like a lightning bolt. Her body convulsing against the roughness of his hand and the shackled that bound her as wave after wave of pleasure wash over her. He lowered her back to her feet and pulled his fingers from her sex. She slumped against her bonds her eye lids fluttering as she tried to regain control of her body. He slapped her across the face with one hand and forced his cum soaked fingers into her mouth. 
�Clean them whore.� She began to suck on his fingers as tears started rolling down her cheeks. Her eyes still glazed over knowing that the passion that had driven her here was already returning. He smiled at her and without saying another word he turned and left. He disappeared followed by his silhouette against the flicker of the fading torch light. 
Her response to his harshness had been more than he had hoped. Whether from her training as a slave and servant or from a naturally submissive nature, he didn&#8217;t know. He only knew that it had fueled his hunger for her. A hunger he had thought long past.
Slowly her breathing returned to normal and she started to focus on the present. She could hear the steady drip of water as it fell from a stone in the wall to a bucket on the floor. There were no windows and no light of any kind. The room was cold and the darkness was complete. She could have screamed, or died and no one would have known. She screamed anyway. The sound of hear shrill desperate voice echoed off the stone walls and faded until all was silent once more. 
Hopeless, she did what she could do. She waited for his return. She tried to tell herself that she could hope for someone&#8217;s return, someone who would rescue her from her imprisonment. It was a fleeting thought. Other thoughts quickly challenged and shouted down the hope that it had offered. She was already a slave. She would only leave this prison to return to another that looked better to others but was still cruelty to her. She wanted his return. Right and wrong could be damned and forgotten. She wanted the man who had become her vision of power and lust. She hated herself for it but she wanted his return.
Time meant nothing to her in this new world were there was no sunlight, or warmth and the only things left to her were the cold of the stone, the weight of the chains and the bite of the manacles. She spent the time racing from thoughts of what awaits her, to questions of her own sanity, and to the burning desires that were keeping her nipples hard and her pussy moist. 
The foot steps started softly, slowing drawing closer. The smell of the torch returned and the light forced her eyes to blink as they tried to adjust to having light once more. She had no way to know that only minutes had past or that he had gone only to make sure that his long time slave and lover Clarisse knew his expected silence in the matter and to have her begin preparing for the next phase in his newly formed plan to make Maggie his own.
He walked towards Maggie with purpose, even as he forced himself to slow his pace lest he betray is own lustful need. He stopping in front of her and calmly asked,� What do have to say for your self?�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Her mind was reeling from the passions her captivity had stirred, and the speed at which her life had changed. She didn't know what to say and started mumbling that she was sorry and begged for forgiveness and mercy. Even as she heard the words her body silently begged for more, begged for the harshness that had brought her more pleasure then she had ever imagined possible.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A smirk crossed his face as he stepped away and began to walk around the room lighting the previously unseen torches that line the room. Each new torch revealed more of the prison that held her. Her eyes fixed on a table standing in the middle of the room with shackles at the feet, and another set of shackles at the head of the table attached to chains. She broke her stare to look at a huge �x� made of wooden beams leaning against the opposite stone wall. The torch light flickered off a metal cage suspended just above the floor by a huge iron chain. Everywhere she looked she saw furniture and tools that filled her with fear. Her heart raced at the vision of things before her. The light revealed implements of torture that she had never imagined and in that moment didn&#8217;t want to. The wall also held wooden boards with pegs that where draped with whips of various lengths, and handles with multiple strands of leather hanging as if waiting for a victim. He returned to her and smiled again. It was a devious self-indulgent smile.
�Your mistress is in need of a maidservant not a whore. I&#8217;m going to teach you the difference and your place in my Lord&#8217;s house.� He possessed her completely, they both knew it and wanted it as his hands began to grope her breast pulling away only to grasp her nipples and pinch them between in his thumb and fore fingers. The passion returned with the sweet taste of fear. Yes, it was sweet it was moving her again. It stirred her passions and again turned the pain in her arms and wrists into pleasure. He pulled her body forward by the nipples forcing them to stretch against her bounds. 
He released her aching nipples and again reached down to feel the heat in her pussy. His fingers covered by the wetness of her hunger. He began to play with her clit. He rubbed it in ever hardening circles. His eyes filling with lust as her body betrayed her again and begged for more. She tried to drive herself into his touch. Her eyes rolled back and all of her being was on that delicious circle passing over her clit.
So close.. 
Soooooo close..
Closer..
�Oh God yes.. Please..�
�What are you?�
�Mmmmmmmm� Please.. harder..�
He pulled away and with amazing speed slapped her across her breast.
�Ahhh......� she screamed. The blow set her skin on fire. 
�I asked you a question. What are you?� His hand made an arc and struck her other breast. 
�I do not understand?� She said as tears began streaming down her cheeks. She lied. She knew. She knew what she was, what her body was telling her she was. It told her what she wanted to be. He slapped her again this time across the cheek. Spots of light filled her eyes.
�Do not lie to me! Tell me what you are!� His voice shook her with it&#8217;s strength and ferocity. She tried to form the words as the blows started again.
�I&#8217;m a whore, sir.� The blows were raining down on her breasts and sides. One hand became two and her entire body was turned into an encompassing sensation of flames as she continued to scream out,� I&#8217;m a whore.. I&#8217;m a whore, please stop.. oh God. I&#8217;m a whore, sir.. please..�
The words were like a sweet wine and he was drunk on them.
 The blows stopped as suddenly as they started. Her body was cover with sweat and her chest was heaving as she fought for air.
He bent down and released her ankles. He then stood up and released her wrists. Her skin remembered every blow and her juices freely flowed down her thighs. She knew that even one more blow and the pleasure that she had found before would have been hers again. She didn&#8217;t understand it, but she knew. He grabs hold of both of her nipples and pulls her down onto her knees. 
He pushed down his breaches, to reveal his hard cock. He didn't speak. He just grabbed hold of her hair and pulled her to his manhood. She opened her mouth silently and without protest as he pushed his cock into its eager depths.
It was different then the stories that her roommates had told. It was scary. The taste was strong. The smell was stronger. Her mouth tried to adjust to the size and taste of the intruder as it moved in and out. Suddenly it drove forward until her nose pressed against the hair at its base. Her nostrils filled with the musky sent of his body. His cock was as thick as her wrist and stretched her mouth as he drove it inside her. She started to gag as it drove into her throat and tried to catch her breath as he pulls it back only to have him drive it forward again and again.
For the first time, she tried to resist and tried to push her body away and free herself of his manhood but his strength was driven by his lust and it would not be denied. He pulled her forward by the hair as the speed and force of his thrusts increased. He pulled her forward and held her tight leaving her unable to breathe before his own ecstasy over took him. He felt his cum spurting into her throat and mouth.
He released her hair as she pushed herself free of its still throbbing length. His cum still flowing from his cock as it popped free dripping from her mouth over her chin onto her sweat-covered breasts.
Time stops while he regained his composure. His orgasm was complete and all encompassing. Everything else disappeared as his mind floated in the ecstasy of the moment. His body shuttered in aftershocks. Regaining control of himself he pulled his breaches back over his saliva soaked cock. Maggie stayed on her knees at his feet unmoving except to wipe away the cum from her mouth with the back of her arm. She didn&#8217;t think the taste. It was neither good nor bad. It was just what it was and part of a force that demanded her submission. 
That wasn&#8217;t entirely true she thought. She cursed that the thought. She tried to make it go away, but it wouldn&#8217;t. She wanted it. She wanted to taste it, feel it, submit to it. Her body felt as like lightning had struck the ground close by. Every sensation in her body was amplified and overwhelming. Each stroke of his cock in her mouth had filled a part of her with a hunger, a desire to feel it in other places. Her thoughts waged a war inside her as she starred at his saliva soaked still pulsing manhood.
The reprieve was brief as he once again grabbed hold of her hair and pulled her to her feet. He pulled her behind him until she was standing in front of the table that she had seen earlier. He bent her forward over the table and kicked her legs apart. 
�Keep still.� He demanded as he kneeled down.
He secured her ankles to the legs of the table before moving forward and pulling her wrists as far as they would go before securing them to the other side of the table.
She was lost, lost in her wanting. She felt so open and exposed yet all she wanted was more. 
His hunger satisfied for the moment, he stopped to admire her body once more. He could smell her need, and feel the heat of her body in the air. He should have left her to her indulgences. His owns lusts now satisfied he found himself angry with her. He was angry with her for having so much power over him. He knew it was his choose to walk into the room and that his anger was with his on weakness. Still, the wheels of fate had been set in motion and he needed to know her body would respond to the pain that he had found such pleasure in inflicting. Using his anger only made it easier.
He walked to the wall and lifted a couple of straps from the pegs and a handle from its pegs. The heavy leather strands swayed below the handle with each step as he moved towards her again. He moved next to her and tied a wide leather strap over her eyes, and another that he pulled between her lips before tying them behind her head. Denied the light again she tried to hear her captor to find him in the darkness. Instead, she heard the ominous swish of the leather strands as they cut through the air. At first that was all that she heard the swish, swish, swish as they moved through the cold air of the dungeon. Then she felt it, the bite of the leather against her still burning skin.
The strands struck without mercy moving up and down her legs, ass and back. The blows moved from one side of her body to the other in a dance of pain. The fire in her skin fueled a need that had remained unquenched in her loins. The dance drove her closer in a relentless race that her body demanded it win. 
Her legs trembled as her body desperately tried to find some way to drive itself deeper into the blows that were raining down it. She screamed a desperate scream as blinding white warmth washed over her in wave after relentless wave. Her world, her everything disappeared and all that she was became one with the pleasure that had replaced the pain. 
Her mind slowly returned to the present to find that her capture has once again disappeared. She was bent and tied and knowing that the hunger in her needed to be fed again. The heat of the torches faded while the darkness grew stronger and remained to trap her in her hunger for more.












Chapter 2

She had drifted asleep in the darkness. It was a restless dream filled sleep. They were the dreams that blur the lines between the world of dreams and reality. It was in this state of waking dreams that her captor discovered her. She thought she heard the footsteps, but her senses didn&#8217;t begin to return to her until she felt the gentle touch of a hand tracing an invisible picture on the backs of her thighs, her ass and her exposed sex. The gentleness of the touch cutting into her soul as it passed over the inflamed and hypersensitive skin. 
Her pussy had become swollen and wet even before she became fully aware. The darkness confused her until she remembered the blindfold, the flogging, and the ecstasy. Her capture had only the gag before he left her. Her breathing quickened and soft moans again began to escape her lips.
&nbsp;&nbsp; �Oh god please.. please touch me..� her words in truth where just a whisper, but in the room of stone and silence they sounded like a lust filled roar.
Two fingers roamed back and forth against the outsides of her pussy.
�So close..�
�Please..�
�What are you?� The words came to her as a whisper. She could feel the breath on her ear as he spoke. It sent a shiver through her body. The fingers still traced the outline of her lips.
�Oh god there&#8217;s some one else.� The words formed in her mind like a roar of thunder but outwardly she just moaned.
�A whore sir.� She said as she fought for enough control to speak.
�Who&#8217;s whore are you?� 
�Your whore sir.� Still the fingers gently traced the outline of her lips. Her words turned to a groan as a finger slid through the part of her lips stopping just short of her clit.
�What will my whore do?� Damn that voice she thought. Each word sent shivers through her. God she wanted to be a good girl, she was a good girl, but the need, the hunger, the pleasure, the pain.. God I am a whore she thought.
�Anything sir.� 
�You like the pain don&#8217;t you?�
�No sir.� Oh God grant forgiveness, she did like the pain! How could she like the pain? Pain is bad. It is wrong. The lust was so wrong. The thoughts raced through head still knowing that her answer was an honest one.
Then it came again. The pain came as the floggers leather straps once again wrapped around the tender flesh of her ass. The tears streamed down her cheeks and still the fingers tormented her.
�Lying little whore!� The voice echoed through her mind as two fingers drove into her wet sex.
�You like the pain don&#8217;t you?�
�Yes. Yes I like it..�
�Ask for it!� his voice thundered in lust from her side.
The gasped for the breath to speak,� Please sir.. Please more sir.. Oh god please..�
�Such a lust filled tart.� Soft and filled with a lust of its own it was familiar. It was the voice of a woman. It was the voice of her mentor and friend. Clarisse watched her as she taken like a street whore to the dungeon. Her fingers tormented the folds of Maggie&#8217;s desperate sex. 
The leather straps returned to wrap around Maggie&#8217;s back. Knowing that it was Clarisse only fueled the desires that surged through her again.
Maggie had known Clarisse from the beginning of her life at the estate. It was Clarisse who had trained her as a housemaid. She showed Maggie kindness while she suffered with the loss of her family. Clarisse was also the first one to introduce her to the pleasures of womanhood. She would climb into bed with her and curl up with her in the dark loneliness of those early nights. A few weeks after sleeping with her Clarisse began to touch her under her nightgown. She would caress her breasts. It wasn&#8217;t long before the touches became more urgent and worked their way down to Maggie&#8217;s pussy. The months that followed led to more lessons and the pleasures of receiving and giving oral sex.
Clarisse had given her pleasures and joy and peace that she hadn&#8217;t even known with her parents. She had also brought her gret pain when she had failed to learn or complete her duties. That was like home too. The difference was that Clarisse had always offered forgiven, acceptance, and even Maggie had thought love when her discipline was finished. When she became the Countess&#8217; chambermaid she was moved to the room next to the countess, and no longer had time to spend with Clarisse. 
�Clarisse Please.. please lick my pussy.. please.. please make me cum..�
Her begging turned to screams as the tender touch of her one time lover stopped and turned to agony as she slid her fingers forward and pinched her clit.
The agony turned into blinding warmth that slammed through her body making it shudder uncontrollably as the orgasm washed over her. The warmth passed into darkness as she passed out again.
When she woke again the corset has been stripped from her along with silken stockings. She was lying face up on top of the table. Her wrists were bound to Clarisse&#8217;s ankles.&nbsp; She felt the pressure of the blindfold as it lifted from her eyes. She blinked against the light of the torch and discovered that she was looking up Clarisse&#8217;s swollen sex. Her thighs and calf strained against the leather straps that held her calves and thighs together. Her nipples pulled against the ties that held firmly to the straps that bound her bent legs together.
Clarisse was on her knees with her ankles bound with leather straps to the wrists of her master&#8217;s new toy. Her wrists were above her head secured to a beam above her. Another leather strap filled her mouth and her nipples had been tied and stretched with a string that went from her nipples over her shoulders and down her back, They pressure pulling against the lips of her pussy forcing them apart and pushing against her clit before it attached to the straps that secured Maggie&#8217;s legs.
Maggie could hear the swish of the flogger once again.
�Clarisse has been a very naughty girl. She let you cum even though I and specifically told her that she was not to let you cum.�
Maggie watched as the straps sliced through the air and curled around Clarisse&#8217;s back. They struck again and again in the same dance that she had felt before. Each strike of the leather made her remember the blows on her own flesh. Each made her want the fire they brought to her. She could smell Clarisse&#8217;s sex and the see the juices as they began to flow down Clarisse&#8217;s thighs. Maggie wanted it. She needed it, needed to taste the essence of her first lover again. She lifted her head and extended her tongue stretching to reach the soft wet folds that hovered above her.
Each taste, each stroke of the leather, the sound of each blow combined to build the fire in her again. Her lover&#8217;s lips were just close enough to taste but to far away to please completely. If she strained her body she could drive her tongue deeper in Clarisse&#8217;s depth the strain caused her legs to pull on straps that were tied to Clarisse&#8217;s nipples.
Maggie didn&#8217;t have a way to know that the straps led to Clarisse&#8217;s nipples. She just knew that she needed to taste her. She strained even more to reach the depths that she knew would bring them both the release that they needed as Clarisse&#8217;s screams echoed through dungeon.
The leather straps continued their relentless assault moving from Clarisse&#8217;s back to her stomach to the underside of her exposed breasts before working their way down the front of her legs. They passed from Clarisse&#8217;s spasming body to Maggie&#8217;s stomach and pussy. Her body jerked against the blows and pulled her nipples as the pain drove her back to the brink of the abyss that now consumed her every thought.
The dance concluded and she laid her head back on the table. Her chest was heaving and tears streamed from her eyes. Her only thought, her only want was to plummet over the edge again to the waves of warmth that waited to envelop her.
�Anything. I&#8217;ll do anything.. Oh god sir please.. Please.. Anything. Anything..� She couldn&#8217;t stop. She needed it. She had to have it. Nothing else mattered.
He threw the flogger to the floor, and pushed down his breaches. His cock was throbbing and his body covered in sweat. His chest was heaving as moved between her legs, and without words drove his cock inside her soaked pussy.
The pain was searing and glorious all at the same time. She plunged again in the ecstasy that now consumed her existence. She road the waves of its bliss into the darkness again as her master fucked her in his own drive towards ecstasy.












Chapter 3

Maggie woke up slowly dreaming dreams of pain and pleasure. Her eyes opened to find a sun lit room blinking against the harshness of light after so much time in darkness. She was in the comfort of her own bed. She was happy, warm and even content. It wasn&#8217;t until she moved to get out of bed that she remembered it all. Her battered body ached and protested against even the slightest motion.
She was determined to get up despite the pain. The flood of memories of the dungeon and her discovery at the hands of the governor overwhelmed her. Tears returned to her eyes and her contentment fled before uncertainty. Now that she had remembered and was returned to the light of day she needed to learn her fate. She needed to go the governor. She would beg him for mercy, and for the privilege of continuing in service to her mistress the Countess de la Fontaine. The passion and the pain would live in her dreams and be forgotten in the world of daylight and responsibility. 
Her body was not as determines as her mind. She nearly collapsed on the floor as she tried to stand. She caught herself on the edge of the bed and laid back down still determined to seek forgiveness.
Clarisse slowly pushed open the door to her room. Her back pushing the door as she steered a serving tray. She wore her usual uniform and seemed perfectly ordinary in every way. Seeing Maggie awake brought a smile to Clarisse&#8217; face.
�Good morning pet.�
�Sweet Clarisse was it real? Was all of it real?�
�Yes, pet. All of it was real.� Clarisse said with a knowing wink.
Maggie groaned as she pushed herself upright on the bed. Her naked breasts and stomach exposed to reveal a criss-cross pattern of red stripes. �Please forgive me? I did not mean to cause you such harm! I just couldn&#8217;t stop myself. I&#8217;m so sorry.� The tears returned to her cheeks as she spoke. She desperately wanted the comfort of her innocence. She wanted to forget what she had learned about this new world of passion. In the light of day it seemed so wrong. The aching in her body no longer fueled the passion that had driven her in the darkness.
Clarisse set the tray down on the wooden dresser beside the bed. Carefully she sat down on the edge of the bed next to Maggie took her in her arms like a mother would a hurt child. 
�Dearest Maggie, you own me no apologies. Like you, I learned that the pain brings me pleasure. I have gladly found myself in the dungeon. There have been many such times for me more then a few of which I begged to receive from Antonio in his bed chamber.�
�I don&#8217;t understand?�
Clarisse wiped the tears from her cheek. �Not completely, not yet, but just as I taught you and cared for you when you first arrived I will again. That is enough talking for now. You haven&#8217;t eaten in nearly two days. You have gotten some rest but your body will need a little time to recover.�
�One more question please?
�Yes pet.�
�Why did you? I mean.. why did you make me cum? Didn&#8217;t you know what would happen?�
�Yes pet. I knew.�
�Then why?�
�When I watched Antonio take you to the dungeon. It made me wet and even jealous in a way. I have so missed our nights together. He came back up stairs to make sure that I would keep silent. I begged him then to let me serve him in the dungeon.�
Maggie could feel the arousal returning to her worn body. Her exposed nipples hardening as Clarisse spoke. She also knew that Clarisse was feeling the same. She saw it in her eyes.
�Seeing you bound and exposed.. I remembered the feelings. I wanted it too.&nbsp; I wanted to feel the leather against my skin.. the pain.. the pleasure. And, I knew from how you where responding to his blows that it would give you what you wanted more then anything else at that moment.�
Clarisse bent forward and gently, passionately as Maggie lowered herself back on the bed. Maggie&#8217;s mouth moved from her lips down her throat to softly caress and nibble her breasts and nipples.
Yes, she remembered. They both remembered.
Maggie pushed the coverlet down exposing her sex to Clarisse. She tried to guide Clarisse&#8217;s hand to her moist pussy, but Clarisse pushed her hands away and lifted herself from Maggie now heaving breasts.
�You need rest more, and besides that my Master has forbidden me to play with you until you have more training.�
�What kind of training?� Maggie asked even though she already thought she knew the answer.
Clarisse just laughed at her and walked towards the door. �Eat and rest. We&#8217;ll talk about the rest latter.� 
Maggie sighed in frustration and resignation as Clarisse left the room. She felt reassured at least a little and began to realize just how famished she had become. The meal was excellent far better then the ones that she would normally be serviced at the servants quarters. She drank it down with a glass of wine. It had made her much more herself, and had helped to relieve some of the soreness from her body. 
She laid back down and reflected on the past two days. The memories only stirred her arousal again and she slid her hands beneath the covers to massage her breasts and rub her clit until she came again. The orgasm wasn&#8217;t as intense as those she had experienced at the hands of Antonio, but it was nice none the less and soon after she drifted off to sleep and dreamed dreams of captivity, the pleasures of pain, Antonio, and Clarisse.












Chapter 4
 
When Maggie woke up once more she was immobile and in the dark. Her first instinct was to panic, and she began pulling against her bonds. The uselessness of the efforts quickly realized. She could feel the leathers straps around her wrists pulling her arms out and above her. There were more straps around her ankles pulling her legs out and down. The straps securing her knees, thighs, and elbows were equal steadfast. She could also feel the pressure of straps wrapped around her body. The first strap was wider then those that secured her wrists and ankles and wrapped around her chest and back just above her breasts keeping her from moving her upper body. The second matched the first in pattern and size but it wrapped around her from the other side and came just below her breasts. Two more straps repeated the patter around her hips and prevented her from moving her hips.
The struggle though brief and the realization of what it meant quickly sent her body into the spiral of lust that she had been dreaming about since she was first caught on her mistress&#8217; bed. She knew that she was not in the dungeon as there was some level of cushioning beneath her, and she suspected that she was still in her room.
What she didn&#8217;t know was that the wine that she had been given by Clarisse included some medicine Antonio had obtained from the local apothecary. She had indeed sleep very soundly so Clarisse and Antonio and no difficulty in binding her. She tested her bindings in silence unaware that bound and waiting on her knees was Clarisse. Her hands bound behind her back. Her breast wrapped with leather cords. Her head bent forward as she sucked on Antonio&#8217;s cock.
Antonio relished the pleasures that Clarisse&#8217;s mouth offered him. She had been his lover for several years but she was a price of his newly found power. She was trained slave rather than the recipient of his affections. Over the years he had found himself wishing that he could offer her his heart. She deserved it genuine affection and h knew that in part she had gotten that from Maggie after Maggie&#8217;s purchase at the insistence of the countess.
He had served the count and the estate for nearly twenty years. The first few years where filled with darkness and misery. There were times that he still shuddered at the memories of those early days. He still bore the scars on his back and in his mind.
The oldest scars came to him after he had tried to run away from his new owners. He was seventeen years old then. He knew that the skills he had learned on the streets of Paris would enable him to evade anyone who would pursue him. The streets of Paris did not prepare him to evade the skilled noses of trained hunting dogs. His freedom was short lived. He returned to the estate&#8217;s dungeon. The sound of the whip and his screams blended as they echoed off the stone walls. His blood stained the floor. The torment continuing until he passed into unconsciousness. It was weeks before he had the strength to return to labors of the field.
The young count was sitting in a chair staring at the deep cuts covering his exposed back when he finally awoke. A shuddered passed through Antonio&#8217;s body when the count spoke.
�That was a foolish thing to do Antonio. What you felt, and feel now was your choice. You must learn to govern our feelings. Feelings are never wisdom. Learn to control your body and your feelings and you will discover rewards that even most aristocrats never know.� The count stood and walked out of the room without another word.
The pain that pulsed through Antonio&#8217;s body with every beat of his heart fueled a rage within him. He had killed once and now desired to do it again. He swore that he would avenge himself.
The count returned to his room every day. He would ask questions about life, politics, art and Paris. Sometimes the answers Antonio gave would please him immensely. Other answers would cause him to launch into a discourse on what the answer should have been. 
He seemed especially interested in the pain and the memories of the whipping. He seemed to take a sadistic glee in hearing about the pain and from the sight of wounds. Antonio was not a stranger to inflicting pain himself. His found his experiences however where always in the context of sex and with intention of bringing out the pleasure in the pain. The count seemed to find no erotic value in the pain. He simply seemed to enjoy inflicted it for the sake of the watching his victims responses to the pain.
Despite his sadistic nature as the weeks passed the Count and Antonio developed something that was close to a friendship. It could have been built out of mutual respect or understanding. It could have but it had not. Antonio had forged it out of necessity. The Count had forged it for personal gain. 
Antonio had found that relationship valuable over the years. Most people feared the Count. Everyone seemed to despise him. That Antonio seemed to respect him and understood in part his sadistic nature gave him value to the strange Count.
It wasn&#8217;t long before the Count had him re-assigned from the fields to the house as his personal servant. Antonio&#8217;s days filled with hours of study. He learned to read and write. He was required to study many of the books in the family library and of course, the Count soon had him helping torture his many victims. The servants came to fear him as much as they feared the young Count. He learned to wield the whip and learned the finer points of using all that remained hidden under the estate floors. 
After his father&#8217;s passing the young Count took procession of the estate. His mother pushed him into marrying so that he could establish a bloodline.
He chose a young bride of fourteen from the house of Lapointe named Maria. Her family&#8217;s wealth was comparable to his and the politics of the aristocracy was favorable to the union but it was a marriage of show and not one of affection. The Counts affections were reserved for stable boys and for the dungeon that remained his true mistress.
Antonio nurtured the count&#8217;s trust knowing the value it could hold for him. Even as a trusted confidant the sadistic side of the count would use any displeasure as cause to carry out its cruel ambitions. Many more scares would add to the pattern of scars on his back over time but none as harsh as the first. When the governor of the house died in his sleep the Count chose Antonio has is successor.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Shortly after his appointment as governor, Clarisse came to the house of Fountaine. She was beautiful and strong willed, but still burdened by the awkwardness of youth. Antonio had the power to take her and make her his. The Count had given him all that was his to manage and possess so long as he kept the Count&#8217;s secrets and made it possible for the Count to indulge his own hungers.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He sometimes regretted what he did to Clarisse. He knew that the reason his affections could never be given to her. He could never know that she would have given her own to him freely. Her mouth still sliding up and down the length of his engorged cock, Antonio knew that Maggie must be different. He wanted her to choose him even though it was a choice that she was not supposed to make. He resolved himself to the plan that he chosen and pushed Clarisse away from his saliva coated cock. He left Clarisse on her knees and moved to the side of the bed.
�It&#8217;s time to learn another lesson.� She knew the voice it was Sir. Antonio had returned and bound her in her sleep. The voice was soft and filled with a smugness that made her angry, though she didn&#8217;t dare say anything. Seeing Maggie stir against the bounds, he had pushed Clarisse away, and silently moved to Maggie&#8217;s side. She felt his hand start to caress her breast this time gently almost lovingly.
�What are you?� The question made her heart flutter.
�I&#8217;m a whore, sir.� 
Antonio pinched her nipple. She screamed in surprise!
�A whore is what you where. You are a slave. A whore fucks whomever she chooses for what ever she chooses. You are a slave and shall not fuck anyone for any reason unless your master or mistress tells you. If I find out that you&#8217;ve been acting like a whore again you&#8217;ll be punished severely. Do I make myself clear?� he continued to squeeze her nipple as he spoke.
�Yes, sir.� She said panting. Some how the distinction made her feel better. She had been a slave since the age of twelve when her parents sold her. Her place as a whore had been new and against the tenants of the church. 
He released her nipple, and returned to the soft caress with which he started. �What do slaves do?�
�We do whatever you want sir?� His hand stopped it&#8217;s gentle touch and snapped back to slap down on her breast and nipple. The pain shoot through her once again. 
�You are to do what ever your master or mistress wants from you. I did not say that I was willing to be that to you.�
No, sir. Thank you for correcting me sir.� 
The pleasure of his touch returned and began to blend with the throbbing in her nipple fueling the need for more.
�Good girl. Are you ready to learn how to be a good slave?� That terrible and wonderful voice had become almost hypnotic. His caress began to move from her breasts across her stomach.
�Please sir.. I want to learn to be a good slave.�
�Such a good girl.� The words seem to fill her head. It made her want to please him. It made her mind, her heart, her depths want to please him.
�Pleeeaassee Sir.. oh god please.�
�Please what?�
�Please sir, let me please you. Let me do what you want. Please sir, touch me. Fuck me. Oh god, anything sir.� Her voice filled with lust, and need. He smiled again and let the path of his finger tips move farther down her stomach.
�You found the pleasure in pain didn&#8217;t you slave?�
�Mmmmmmmmmmmmmm.. yes.. Siiiiirrrr..� She was getting close again.
�That was lesson one. You needed to accept that truth about yourself. Now you&#8217;re going to learn lesson 2.�
�Pleeeeeeeaaaaaaaaaaaaasssssssssseeeeeee.. siiiiirrrr..� his finger tips where so close. She tried to thrust her body towards him. She tried to move to get them closer still by the straps held her immobile. All she could do was lay trembling at his touch.
�Such a good girl.� He snapped his fingers and Clarisse struggle to her feet and moved too his side.
�We are not going to have the same problem as before are we Clarisse?�
�No Sir.�
�Very well, Let&#8217;s begin.� He pulled the cord that bound Clarisse&#8217; hands and let the strap fall to the floor. He moved silently back to the chair he had been sitting in before, and slowly began stroking his cock as he watched Clarisse start Maggie&#8217;s next lesson.
Clarisse climbed onto the bed so that she was leaning over Maggie&#8217;s head facing her feet. As softly as she could she began to kiss Maggie&#8217;s forehead, and worked her way down her nose. She brushed her cheeks, nibbled and kissed her lips. 
Maggie quickly lost herself in the gentle assault on her senses. Each kiss, each breath, each brush of skin amplified in the darkness. Clarisse pushed herself back just enough to start at Maggie&#8217;s ears and work her way back down following the line of Maggie&#8217;s throat to the dimple at the base of her throat. Her body once again covered in sweat as she trembled uncontrollably against her bonds. She desperately wanted to move, to be free to touch her lover. She wanted to be able to guide her and urge her forward to give her the satisfaction she craved. She begged and pleaded mercy, for pleasure, for pain, for satisfaction but her voice was a whisper even to herself.
Clarisse continued her gentle cruel journey down Maggie&#8217;s desperate form. She was enjoying her part of the journey. Relishing the feel of Maggie&#8217;s body as it trembled against her lips. She found herself stopping to savor the taste of Maggie&#8217;s sweat and the fragrance of her dripping sex. Clarisse let her own hardened nipples gentle slide over Maggie&#8217;s unmoving form as she worked her way down Maggie&#8217;s body with excruciating patience. She carefully moved past Maggie&#8217;s pleading sex down her legs, letting the heat of her hardened nipples caress the inside of Maggie&#8217;s thighs before moving down to her toes, and then back again.
Maggie would get so lost in the feeling that Clarisse created in her body that she would forget to breath. When her need for air became demanding she would suck air into her lungs in desperate bursts. Each breath reminded her of her bounds and renewed her awareness of the straps that held her only to have them disappear again and her mind called back by the relentless kisses and touch of Clarisse. Her mind was lost in the ripples of pleasure that drove her to the edge of the white warmth before fading into frustration. Her desperate wish would draw painfully close, and then flee, only to return again somehow even closer then before. The gentleness of each kiss and touch becoming more difficult to bear as the gentle became the pain.
Antonio watched in admiration as Clarisse pushed Maggie&#8217;s body to the edge of ecstasy only to deny her, and bring her back again and again. Maggie lay beneath Clarisse lost in every sensation. Her whispers had become a strange symphony of grasped breaths, and moans. Antonio stood and moved to the side of the bed. He stopped and ran his fingers down Clarisse&#8217;s sweating back over her perfectly shaped ass, and slid a finger into her dripping sex. Clarisse moaned and thrust herself back onto his probing fingers, only to have him withdraw them again. He licked his fingers and bent down so that his face was next to Maggie&#8217;s.
�Pain and pleasure, my dearest one tell me which do you want?�
Maggie didn&#8217;t answer at first. It wasn&#8217;t until Clarisse stopped her assault and Antonio asked her again.
�Which do you want?�
It was his voice, the consuming presence that she heard. Calling to part of her that she never even knew existed.
�They.. are the.. same sir. The pain.. is.. pleasure... annnddd the.. pleasure... iiisssss pain.. Please sir, anything�� Even that close to her Antonio has to strain to hear her lust filled whisper. 
He wiped away the tears that where streaming down her cheek. �I want you to cum for me now Sweet Maggie.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The words were freedom for Maggie and for Clarisse they where a call to action. She drover her tongue into the soft folds of Maggie&#8217;s sex, and began to flick her tongue over Maggie&#8217;s hardened clit.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She obeyed the command as waves of pleasure washed over Maggie in a title wave of blinding pleasure. Her body pulled against its bonds with a strength that came from her core but they gave no ground. Her head arched back as she screamed an animal scream of lust. Her fingers clenched together. Her knuckles went white, and her toes curled as the spasms washed over her in a seemingly endless series of waves. The rest of her body trapped unable to do anything other then feel.
 The darkness returned to Maggie again as Antonio rewarded the nearly exhausted Clarisse by standing over Maggie and driving his cock into Clarisse&#8217; waiting ass as she too disappeared over the edge of the abyss just as she had been commanded by her master. The waves of ecstasy washed over her just as they did Him as he filling her ass with his essence.
 











Chapter 5

When light and awareness once again returned to Maggie she found that she was still in her bed. She was careful to move slowly as she stirred. She was naked, hungry and desperately needed to pee. She discovered that much of the soreness had disappeared, and that apart from the faint red lines where the straps had secured her she actually felt well. She climbed from the bed to squat over the piss pot and relieve herself. She closed her eyes and begin thinking about all that her body had experienced beneath Clarisse&#8217; gentle torture. Her nipples began to harden again, and she could feel herself getting wet. 
�What have I become?� She thought. She wiped herself clean and washed her hands in the basin before moving in front of the corner mirror. She stood staring at her own reflection. Her eyes traced the pattern of faint red lines that the straps had made on her white skin. Her nipples were still hard and her need was growing slowly but steadily as she stood looking at someone that she didn&#8217;t know. She felt unsure of herself and unsure of what to do next. She found herself hoping that Antonio, or Clarisse would be there to tell her what she was to do next. Quickly deciding that satisfying her hunger was of utmost importance she pulled on her night shirt and left for the kitchen.
The kitchen smelled like heaven to the famished Maggie, and she eagerly pleaded her case for a late breakfast with Nicolas who cooked for the La Fontaine house. The servants usually ate separately but Nicolas had always been willing to make exceptions for Maggie and today was no different.
What was different about breakfast in the main kitchen this morning was just how aware Maggie was of Nicolas and how he treated her. The way that he smiled at her when she entered the kitchen gained new attention. She could see him stealing glances of her as he worked and wondered if he had always done so. Knowing that he looked at her as a desirable woman was adding to her lust. Maggie&#8217;s thoughts refused to leave the experiences of the last few days her thoughts not yielding in their assault on her mind and body. Her nipples remained hard and her state of arousal was not lost on her kitchen benefactor.
Nicolas couldn&#8217;t believe his good fortune. He always enjoyed being able to watch Maggie eat as she always stood with the morning sun beaming through the window behind her. Her body revealed to him through the cotton fabric of her nightgown in a glorious silhouette that he often pictured in his minds eyes as he stroked his cock in the darkness of the night. Today he thought that he could even smell the fragrance of her sex, and his own arousal would have been obvious to all had he not been wearing a long cooking apron.
She thanked Nicolas for his kindness with a soft kiss on the cheek. Nicolas seized the moment and pulled her to him. He wrapped his arms around her in a hug that she shrugged off as brotherly affection. He considered his chance to fell the heat and firmness of her breasts pressed against his chest. He released her with a smile and picture in his mind that he would use in fantasies. She turned to leave the kitchen and make her way back to her room. She turned as she passed through the kitchen door and ran into Antonio as he stood in the hallway.
Her heart jumped into her throat and she nearly came as his sudden appearance brought the fullness of her experiences back to her. Her mind and skin relived them in an instant though it felt as if it was outside the bounds of time.
�Miss Madeline, The Count and Countess will be returning to the estate soon and the rooms to which you have been entrusted are lacking. You will get dressed and get to your duties immediately or I shall be forced to report your slackness to the countess upon her return.�
She stood before him stunned. Her body remembered and silently begged for his dominant touch. Her mind lost as the pictures of her experiences flashed through her mind. Even as she stood overwhelmed before him, he stood before her impersonal and detached. Even the use of her formal name made her flinch. Had the experiences not been so fresh and so abundant she would have thought herself mad. 
�Yes, Sir.� She stammered. �I shall correct the situation immediately.�
�Make sure that you do.� He said as he moved past her without another glance. The lust in Nicolas&#8217;s embrace reached into Antonio&#8217;s thoughts like a fire. He felt an anger rise up in him that he had not felt in many years. A dark dangerous anger that had so many years ago led to his enslavement. He walked away appearing calm but his mind raced to subdue the rising tide of emotion. 
She stood dumbfounded watching him walk away and disappear around the corner of the hallway. Slowly at first but with a growing sense of urgency she went to her room. She dressed and began her chores.
The afternoon went by in a blur. Maggie threw herself into the familiar routine and managed for a while to forget her hunger. The work brought her comfort and a sense of normalcy. She felt herself once again and was prepared to put her thoughts of Antonio and Clarisse behind her.
�Miss Madeline.� The voice was soft but purposeful. Maggie&#8217;s heart again fluttered as Clarisse called her by her formal name.
�Clarisse thank God!� She stood and ran to her rediscovered lover and tried to hug her. Instead, Clarisse pushed her away to avoid the embrace.
�I missed you so. You were gone when I woke and I felt so lost. 
I wanted to thank you.. to..�
Clarisse cut her off mid sentence. �Shut up Child! I don&#8217;t have time for your prattle�
A blow to her stomach would have affected her less.
�I have to help care for the west wing as Maria is sick. I also need you to care for Master Antonio&#8217;s suite before dinner.�
Maggie&#8217;s eye&#8217;s searched Clarisse&#8217;s face for a sign. She searched for some recognition of the hours spent bringing her such torturous pleasures. She would have settled for a hint of the comfort that she had shown her through all of the lonely nights when she first arrived.
Clarisse&#8217;s stern expression offered none of either.
�Did you hear me?�
Maggie&#8217;s mind was still reeling, �What?�
Clarisse&#8217;s hand shot up in a flash and slapped Maggie across her face.
�Pay attention. If I give you instructions I expect you to acknowledge them.�
Tears filled her eyes, and her own hand went to her reddened cheek. �Yes, Miss Clarisse. I understand I am to clean the governor&#8217;s suite before dinner.�
�Then see to it child.�
�Right away Miss Clarisse..�
Before she could get out all the words Clarisse had turned and started to walk away. Once she was out of sight Maggie sank to the floor and pulled her knees to her chest, and let the tears flow freely down her cheeks.
Her mind raced with thoughts thrown together without pattern or reason flooding her mind and overwhelming her heart. �What has happened? What did I do wrong? Perhaps they are no longer pleased with her. What is to happen to me now? How can I go on without feeling what I felt?�
The questions and feelings left her weak and lost, yet her years of service roused her from her apathy. She wiped the tears away, splashed water on her face, and gathered her things before starting towards Antonio&#8217;s suite. Antonio&#8217;s suite was just down the hall from the entrance to the dungeon. She stared at the heavy wooden door as she walked by, remembering her half-naked entry into its depths.
She knocked on Antonio&#8217;s door afraid to enter. �Sir, its Maggie I have come to clean your suite?� 
There was no answer from the other side so she knocked again. Assured by the silence that the suite was empty she opened the door and entered the darkened room. Heavy draperies covered the expanse of windows on the outside wall. She leaned over the sofa that served as a sitting area and pushed the draperies aside to let the evening sun light into the room. 
She wondered why she needed to clean since the room appeared spotless and in perfect order. Her heart started to pound in her chest as she surveyed the room. She realized that in all of her time at the estate she had never been in this room. Even in her time training with Clarisse, she had not entered into his bedroom.
Shelving filled with books covered the wall opposite the windows. She had thought that only the Count and Countess would have been able to afford the luxury of books and she expected those to occupy the shelves of the estate&#8217;s library rather then the personal suite of the governor. Opposite the door she first entered was another door that she supposed led to Antonio&#8217;s bedroom? The thought of being in his bedroom send a rush of heat through her body once again. She walked over to the books touching the soft leather bindings as she continued to survey the room. Its furnishings were simply, but elegant. It has a small writing desk holding the usual candle, quill and ink well. A chair sat out from its edge and some ledgers were stacked on the shelf next to it. She caressed the back of the chair and only after glancing over her shoulder; she leaned over and took a slow deep breath so that she could smell his scent again.
Despite the orderliness of the room, she was careful to make sure that the room was in perfect condition before knocking on the second door. Hearing no answer, she entered the second room. This room was much larger then she had expected. Inside the door stood an easel with a partially painted canvas and a side table with a supply of paints and brushes. The picture was of the estate&#8217;s lakefront on the south side of the estate. The colors were soft and the style captured the settings peaceful warmth at sunrise.
She could see other pictures painted in the same style. Each was done in soft warm colors and detailed points of tenderness and beauty. The brush strokes were soft and flowing. She wasn&#8217;t sure what she had expected but the paintings moved her and amazed her with the emotions that they instilled.
Beyond the easel stood a large armoire and another chair, which at that moment was holding up a draped pair of pants and a white linen shirt. His bed was opposite the main entrance door. It was even larger than the bed in her mistress&#8217; room. It was made of mahogany and had a large carved post that nearly reached the ceiling at each corner. It stood away from the wall behind. She presumed that the arrangement was purposeful and meant to keep the tapestry that hung behind from creasing. Another table stood just to one side of the bed with a candle, his washbasin and pitcher as well as his piss pot.
Maggie looked over her shoulders once again and sighed before starting her chores. She picked up his clothes, and though she should have simply taken them away she stopped and breathed in his scent. It was strong and musky and remaindered her of how he smelled when he forced his cock into her mouth. 
�Who was this man that could bind her, fuck her, and beat her but still find such beauty and warmth in the simple scenes of the estate? She didn&#8217;t know but she desperately wanted to know him. She wanted to understand. Just as she hoped he would help her understand the hunger for things she thought she should despise. Her pussy was wet and her nipples hard as she fought the urge to touch herself. She wanted to feel his bed and to feel his manhood inside her once again.
Still the harshness of his presence earlier in the day, and Clarisse&#8217;s stinging slap across her cheek kept her from giving into the temptations that lade before her. Well, they kept her from most of them. She still indulged her hunger by brushing her nipples against the objects that adored his room. It was a cruelty of its own as it just kept her hunger from abating. She took down his bed and prepared it for the evening so that she could feel the texture of his bedding.
She was just finishing his bedroom when he opened the suite&#8217;s main door. His face was still cold and void of expression.
�Why are you still here Miss Madeline?�
�I was just finishing Sir. I&#8217;m sorry sir.�
�I would suggest that you not inconvenience me this way again. It is no doubt due to your lazy morning. You think that just because your mistress is away that you can be slack in your duties.�
�No sir,.. I mean..&nbsp; I won&#8217;t let it happen again. Please forgive me sir.�
Internally he smiled a wicked knowing smile though to Maggie his face seemed as cold as stone. He stepped asideand pointed to the door.
�Please leave now.�
Her heart was pounding in her Chest. All that she could hear and all that she could see was the image of him in the torch light of the dungeon. She bowed her head and forced herself to move. She desperately hoped that he might seize her at each step. She prayed in her heart of hearts that his anger would stir and that he would return her to the dark depth of stone and captivity.
The prayer was unanswered as she left his room untouched. He spoke no more words, and did not even look towards her again. When the door closed behind her she began to run. She ran through the halls as tears ran down her face and neck. She ran as the juices of her sex began to run down the insides of her thighs. She ran to her room and threw herself down on her bed. She pulled her skirt up and drove her fingers into her wetness. Her body was again demanding that she satisfy it. 
The abyss drew near as she her fingers continued their assault and while the fingers of her other hand began to pull mercilessly on her tender nipples. She passed over the edge only to find that the valley beyond had no depth, and that the waves of pleasure that her body had demanded pasted through her like ripples in a pond.
Her hands fell to her side. Her skirt still pulled up and her sex still exposed. The tears still ran down her cheeks and neck. She was lost. The mundane routine of her day, a day that she had hoped would bring her back into the comfort of her old life only made her feel empty and lifeless.
Her body had not betrayed her in the torch light. It was her mind. Her spirit had given her over to the darkness that she now craved. It was the shadows of her own self that had been unleashed, and she could not turn back the hands of time. 
She had gone too far down the path to turn back but not knowing how to find her way back to the sweet abyss that haunted her thoughts. Her guides had left her to the mundane and the darkness of her room was more oppressive then anything she had even experienced before. She lay unmoving and cried herself into a restless sleep.











Chapter 6 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She awoke still in darkness, but not the forced darkness that she had dreamed of finding. She was wearing the same cloths and still lay in her room unbound and hopelessly free.
One thing had changed however while she slept. Her resolve had changed and she had woken with an idea. She pushed her skirt back down and moved towards the door. She began to hurry as softly as possible down the hall towards Antonio&#8217;s room. 
She raised her hand to knock on his door but found that she could not get her body to obey. She desperately wanted to wake Antonio. She would beg him for to take her beg to be his slave again. She would offer him anything but her hand was help up trembling but unwilling to knock on the door that held her promise. The tears returned to her eyes, and followed the now familiar path down her face. She leaned into the wall and slowly crumbled to the floor. She felt lost once again.
A slave would never wake their master for such selfish ambitions. Waking him would only tell him that she was not worthy of him. �No,� She thought. The quest that took her from her room was the right one but her path to slavery was not through his door. She needed a new path. 
�There must be another way to prove to him that she was destined to be his slave. I have only to find it.� 
Her mind raced and her senses came alive as a new plan formed in her mind. She lifted herself up from the floor and again moved with quiet purpose through the house. She returned to her room, made her bed, straightened the room, and went back through the house with her candle in hand. This time she did not return to Antonio&#8217;s door. She instead moved down the hall in search of another door, a hidden door. She slipped through that door to the darkness and made her way its spiral case to the place that held her promise.
She could feel the stones getting colder on her bare feet, and the coolness of the air against her skin. She opened the door at the foot of the stairs and once inside stripped off her cloths and tossed them to the side against the wall. She used the candle to light a torch and used that in turn to light the rest. 
This was where she wanted to be and she knew that by midday the staff would be searching for her. Even so, no one would look for her in the dungeon except him. He would know where to find her.
She moved about the dungeon not knowing how some of what she found would work. She discovered the secrets of others only to find that she would not be able to use them to bind her self.
Maggie had always been a creative child and she decided how she would ensure her success. She found the leather rope that Antonio had used to bind Clarisse. It ran through a pulley attached to the rafter above the table. Much of what she had found in the dungeon was too heavy to use for her plan. In the end however, she found just what she needed. She filled a water bucket from the corner just full enough to make it a little heavy for her. She tied the handle to one end of the woven leather rope, and the other she used to make a loop that would allow both her hands to pass through. She set the bucket and the loop on the table in front of her. She found the cloth that Antonio had used to blindfold her. Blindfold in hand she stood as she had before at the table&#8217;s base. She secured the shackles around her ankles and placed the blindfold over her eyes. She took on last peak and bent forward. She found the loop just as she expected and put her hands through the loop. She tightened the loop as much as she could and then making sure she got a solid hold on the sides of the bucket, she pushed it with as much strength as she could muster. The bucket slid forward off the table and dropped until the rope caught hold. The weight snapped her wrists up and forward over the table as it pinned her wrists together with the rope.
A thrill shot through her as the pressure of the bucket pulled against her wrists. She had trapped herself with no hope of escape! She knew that she would not have the strength to pull the bucket back to its place on the table even if she changed her mind. The shackles wrapped around her ankles like the familiar embrace of a friend. The cold teased her still hard nipples, and the darkness of her blindfold only heightened her awareness of each strain of her body, each sound however faint, and each smell. She would wait for her master to discover her gift and find her worthy.












Chapter 7

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Her body flushed at the thrill of knowing that she was at last where she knew that she wanted to be. She relished the sensations that coursed through her body. She liked feeling the strain in her wrists as she pulled against the weight of the bucket. She could even feel the change in pressure around her wrists as efforts made the bucket sway back and forth in mid air. The cold metal of the shackles against the skin of her ankles just fed the hunger that had driven err into the darkness. The moisture of her juices as they started to once again leak from her sex, and trickle down her leg. 
Her only companion in the darkness was the sound of water dripping from the wall and the sound of her breathing. The silence amplified what little them and made their constant rhythmic cycles almost hypnotic.
In time, the thrill of her return to captivity diminished and her mind began to fight with her desires. She started to wonder what would happen if he did not come to find her soon. Her fingers tips began to fall asleep and a tingling sensation began to emerge. It forced her to try and move them to restore circulation, but the efforts only seemed to make it worse. The muscles in her legs began to cramp from the strain of being in one place, and tears once again returned to her eyes.
What would happen if he returned only to release her and send her back to the life she had known before? Everything began to blur together as the hypnotic rhythms droned on and her mind lost itself in what if&#8217;s, and possibilities. She started to think that she was losing her mind.
She began to talk to her self out load. Her voice, at first, was a welcome change. It sounded load and unsure to her. She decided to give the dripping sound a name but the only name that she could think of was Splash. She would talk to Splash and ask him questions but his answers only annoyed her so she told him that she would not talk to him anymore. Still he babbled on.
Lost in the timeless darkness she began to drift in and out of sleep. Images played themselves out in her mind. She would never know if they were real or just dreams, not even latter as she looked back on her life. It was from that drifting darkness of awake and not that she snapped fully awake and alert.
She did not know why. She could not remember anything waking her. She instantly became aware of the aching of the muscles from hr toes to her wrists and the numbness of her fingers. She once again felt the chill of the stone room, and became aware of how exposed she was. The cool air chilled her completely now. Goose bumps covered her body and her nipples became hard once again.
She found herself cold, alone, and miserable. This was not what she had hoped to find in the darkness. She started to call out to Antonio, and crying for help. She thought that some how some one would hear her and find her. Even as the thought passed through her mind she knew it would not happen. She cried out in the darkness anyway.
Her desperation began to fill her and her mind began to spin into the darkness of its own thoughts once again.
�What do you want sweet Maggie?� the words where unreal. The words were a trick of her mind, but it sounded like him. It sounded like Sir. She so desperately wanted it to be him.
�I want to be your slave. I want you. I want what ever you want from me.
Oh God, I&#8217;ve gone mad! I&#8217;ve gone completely mad.�
�Why are you here?� The voice became her everything as it returned to her once again. This time it was different stronger but farther away.
Her mind began to hope and the passions that it had fought away began to surge through her again. This time they were stronger, and the painful aching in her body became a fire that sweep down to her exposed sex.
�Please tell me you&#8217;re real! Please tell me you&#8217;ve found me at last!� She begged and made all of her body listen for the voice in her head. She forced the very core of her being to listen for its answer.
�Why are you here?�
�Yes!� She screamed! Unsure if the scream was out loud or only in her mind. It did not matter for she new the answer. He was there with her. He found her in the darkness and that was what mattered. The voice had moved, had changed again, but now she felt him! She felt his presence with her in the dungeon. It was not her imagination. She was not mad. He was real and he hand found her! The thoughts repeated themselves in her mind.
The voice returned to her again this time clear and even stronger as it demanded an answer. �Why are you here?�
Maggie forced herself to stop. She forced herself to breath, and tried to quail the trembling in her voice.
�I didn&#8217;t know where else to go. I was alone and felt lost and this was the only place I could think to go.�
�Why bind yourself this way?�
�Tears and more tears, she would never remember crying more, and more passionately as she did at that moment.�
�I don&#8217;t know.� Her words came in gasps. �I just needed it. Hoping that� that...�
�That I would accept you, accept you as your gift to me unconditionally without demand or thought of consequence.� She could feel him. Even in the darkness without even a single touch or sound as evidence, she knew.
A whimpering yes was all that could manage. Everything lost in his words, and her bodies wants.
His hand reached out and pushed the hair away from her shoulder, before it started to trace a line down her back. His fingers spread and followed her every curve and crease. She felt its movement with all of her being as they brought with them a fire that moved from them to her heart, her nipples, and her sex.
She had found it again in the darkness the abyss, the edge that she craved with all her being to fall from again. It drew closer as his fingers moved over the roundness of her ass and began to trace the folds of her wet sex.
�Are you ready sweet Maggie? The voice returned the voice that had such power over her.
Her answer a moan more then a word but one that he understood completely. His fingers surged into her sex, only to withdraw as quickly. She screamed again in desperation, and began to beg for their return.
The fingers now covered in her juices began to trace the outline of her asshole. She began to try to push against them desperate for his touch. They disappeared again as she screamed and begged not knowing what she was saying as she fought for breath. 
�Are you ready?� The voice filled with a hunger of its own demanding her even as she felt lost with her self.
 �Please oh God please, please.� She began to beg desperately hoping that the answer would be enough.
He moved behind her as he used her own juices to lubricate his cock. His needs demanded He act.
�Cum for me!� he demanded. His voice was nothing more a lust-filled growl as he pressed his cock against her asshole and forced it into her tight depths.
The pain was blinding as his cock forced itself into the depths of her bowels. Blinding as it became a surge that threw her headlong over the abyss into the blinding whiteness that now called her back.
He continued to drive into her unable to stop or prolong his own drive into the blinding whiteness of his own bliss. He grabbed hold of her full breasts and drove into her one last time as he pulled himself into her depths and held himself there. He filled her depths with his cum as he continued to hold himself to her. His body trembling and shacking as the after shock of his passions washed over him. His body falling forward until it rested on her back and pressed her breasts against the hardness of the wooden table.
They stayed that way while each rode the waves of pleasure. When he regained his composure and strength, he pulled his manhood from her and put moved to the front of the table to release her bound wrists. She moaned softly as the blood retuned to her fingers but she had already let the light and sleep reclaim her.
He released her ankles from the shackles that held her and lifted her into his arms. He smiled a deep and satisfied smile as he carried her back to his room. He moved cautiously through the secret hallway that led to the door behind his bed. He laid Maggie on the bed and gently removed the blind fold before returning to the dungeon to douse the torches and close door to the secret entrance. 
His mind was flooded with thoughts. He left the dungeon to walk the estate. Each step a personal quest to understand the events of the past few days and explore the depths of their possibilities. He knew what had to happen, but he also knew what he wanted to have happen and the two could not be reconciled. 
He walked past the stables oblivious to the marks in the dirt. The following day the marks would be gone.
He returned to his bedroom by the light of the moon. He still didn&#8217;t know where this road would take them but for the first time since he became a slave he was content and even happy. He crawled into bed next to Maggie and gently kissed her forehead as she slept. He pulled the covers over them both and laid his head on the pillow.
�I accept your gift Sweet Madeline.� He whispered as he closed his eyes and let his own dreams overtake him.











Chapter 8

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Maggie awoke to the familiar feel of leather straps. She was bound again and blindfolded as before unsure whether she had been without it. She did know that she was no longer in the dungeon. Unlike the dungeon, this room was warm and she was lying face down on a bed that was both soft and luxurious.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Her wrists where secured behind her back bound together as was her elbows not quite together but enough that she knew she would soon feel the strain in her shoulders. Maggie&#8217;s ankles bound together, she began to wiggle. She discovered that her wrists and ankles were somehow connected.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That she was already aroused when she woke had gone without notice. It was if she was in a constant state of arousal and the only question was one of degree. Even so, now alert and having discovered her circumstance her arousal was again growing and hoping for an opportunity to return to the abyss.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She felt a confidence and peace in her bondage. The sensation of the dungeon returning to her and reminding her of the gift she had so freely given. The gift he has so passionately accepted. She could feel the wet stickiness of her sex, and smell her scent in the warm air of the room, and she hoped.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Hope was a strange thing for her.&nbsp; A slave sold in bondage and servitude did not have the luxury of hope. Her life had secured the future for her parents, brother and sisters. She would not know freedom, and would not know such privileges as marriage. Still her bound and shrouded in darkness she found her dared to hope. Here on the path to the white abyss, and in its depth she was complete. The sum of her physical, mental, and emotional joined and basked in a warm peace that she in some way thought must have been the heaven that visiting bishops often spoke about over dinner and wine. Her bondage was her freedom and she would gladly give her body to the one who would take her there.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There was something else. A sound that was both raspy and smooth. It came and went without rhythm or cadence. Occasionally she would here the rustle of water, and movements. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Maggie thought about speaking. Maybe saying good morning, but she didn&#8217;t know what part of the day he had awoken to, and she found that she wanted to relish the quiet sounds and her bonds just a while longer.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Maggie tested her bonds and it had he noticed her efforts subtle struggle. Antonio had been waiting patiently with Clarisse. He watched his gift now safely wrapped once more as she passed from slumber to waking. He was in no rush as Clarisse was shaving his face and head with a straight razor. Her skilled hands moved as if she where a painter and his skin the canvas. His face was free of any nicks or scars. He had long sense ceased to worry and now spend his time beneath her care far away lost in his own thoughts.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Clarisse for her part was standing in front and to the side of her master deep in concentration despite having her master&#8217;s skilled fingers playing with the folds of her sex, and her clit. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When Clarisse finished his shave, she took a warm cloth and wiped away the remaining traces of shaving cream. She caught her breath and fought to make her legs stop shaking as her master withdrew his taunting fingers from her sex. The climax denied her thought she had been teetering on the edge as he stood and moved towards Maggie.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Clarisse waited patently for the chance to follow the instructions that her master had given her. She composed herself quickly and moved to the side of the bed opposite Antonio. Moving together almost as it was a familiar dance Antonio and Clarisse climbed onto the bed and grabbed hold of Maggie. Antonio gabbed her shoulder while Clarisse her knee and together they rolled Maggie onto her side. Her hardened nipples and the swollen slick lips of her pussy exposed to their greedy gaze.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Maggie began to speak but before she could utter a word, Antonio slid his hardened cock into her mouth. Clarisse pushed herself forward and made her body a lever to push Maggie&#8217;s legs wide apart and to expose her sex to them even further. Maggie&#8217;s heart began to pound as they claimed her body again. Her grown sent vibration through Antonio&#8217;s cock as her mouth stretched to accommodate his fullness. He loved the effect.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Grabbing Maggie by the hair, he pulled her head down and forced his cock deeper into the warmth of her mouth. He held her down and left her with just enough space in her mouth to keep her from choking on his manhood.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�It is time that you learn the rules that you shall be expected to follow. Whenever I ask you a question, I expect an immediate answer. Do you understand?�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Maggie understood perfectly. She was however unsure how to answer with his cock filling her mouth and hesitated as a result. A sharp pain went through her body radiating from her pussy as Clarisse slapped the mound of her pussy with the flat of her hand. Maggie&#8217;s scream sent even stronger vibrations into the depths of Antonio&#8217;s cock. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�You must not have understood.� Antonio said. �Let me start over. If I ask you a question, I expect it to be answer immediately. Do you understand?�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Maggie said yes and shook her head in affirmation. Her yes only a muffled mumble but both actions created the pleasant stimulation that his cock craved. He smiled at Clarisse who in turn smiled at him as she lightly caressed the lips of Maggie&#8217;s now extra sensitive pussy.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Better. You are to address me as Master unless we are in the presence of other in the daily realm of the estate. Do you understand?�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Maggie again shook her head in affirmation and promptly said a muffled yes. Only to have her yes turn to a scream as Clarisse brought her hand down and slapped Maggie&#8217;s exposed breast.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I would suggest that you pay better attention to what I say in the future slave. Let us try again. You are to address me as Master unless we are in the presence of other in the daily realm of the estate. Do you understand?�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This time she said yes master as she nodded her head. Clarisse&#8217;s gentle Clarisse returning to the folds of her pussy and sending shivers through her body. She fought for breath as she tried to breath through her nose, and exhaling in bursts that made her cheeks swell as the air forced its way past her master&#8217;s cock. Drool was dripping from her lips and down her cheeks.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Damn that voice!� Maggie thought. That voice that I crave and dream about. Somehow, she both hating and loving the voice that called her like a siren. Hating it for the pain but loving it for the pleasure and freedom.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�You shall refer to Clarisse as Mistress or Miss Clarisse, and shall obey her as you will me. Do you understand?�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Yes Master.� Master Antonio was beginning to love the sound of those words as they pasted through his throbbing cock. Clarisse rewarded Maggie by sliding a finger into the depths of her wet pussy.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�You will be mine to use, or punish as I please. You will submit your pleasure to me just as you submit your body to me. That means, you are to assume that permission to cum has been denied unless one of us expressly grants you permission. If you do I will make sure are punished in such a way as to not allow you to cum. Do you understand?�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Yes Master.� The answer was becoming rote as she tried to focus on the voice. Each moment that pasted made it more difficult as each answer brought with it more stimulation from Clarisse and she found herself dangerously close to passing over the edge of the abyss. She gurgled out the answer as Clarisse drove two fingers into her sex, and began to pinch and pull one of her nipples. Maggie&#8217;s words turning into an animal like moan sending vibrations deep into her master&#8217;s cock.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She wanted to pass over the edge desperately but the voice, that damned evil, beautiful, glorious voice said no. It called her back but her body bit her to pass into the glorious white bliss. Her breath held in anticipation. Her entire being was waiting suspended at the edge.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Her body began to shake in frustration as her master pulled her head back releasing his throbbing saliva coated cock from her mouth just as Clarisse released her nipple and withdrew her sex-coated fingers from Maggie&#8217;s depths. Maggie&#8217;s breath returning in spasms as she began begging her master to cum.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�These are only the first of many rules that you must sweet one. You must choose. Once you give yourself to me and accept me as your Master you shall bound to me. That was your wish when you returned to the dungeon, but you can still return to your old life. You can seek absolution from the priest and have all be as it was. If that is your choice, neither Clarisse or I shall ever return you to the dungeon, and shall again be touched or acknowledged as anything but a chambermaid by myself or Clarisse.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Maggie&#8217;s chest heaved as she fought to breath. Her mind tried to absorb the full meaning of his words. She knew that she could not go back to life as it had been. Her tears dropped freely into her blindfold as she fought for the breath to speak. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I&#8217;m only free when I am in your service master.� The words came in rushes between breaths but held a tone of confidence.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I am your slave, and wish to be so with all my being. Do with me as you wish.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Master Antonio smiled with pride and genuine affection at his bound slave. He pulled her forward again as he drove his cock into her mouth. He began fucking her mouth in earnest sometimes slowly and deeply, sometimes in quick thrusts pulling her head down as he drove into her. He relished the power that she had given him over her. Fucking her stretched mouth until his cum began to shoot down her throat and fill her mouth. Pulling her head back and freeing his still pulsing manhood from her. He released her hair and moved off the bed as Clarisse moved forward to lick away the cum that seeped from the corners of Maggie&#8217;s mouth. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;With the taste of her master on her lips, Clarisse raised herself over Maggie&#8217;s face, and grabbing hold of both nipples claimed her promised reward.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Lick my pussy slave. Lick it and make me cum all over that sweet face.�
Maggie began to driver her tongue into the wet folds of Clarisse&#8217;s swollen sex. She drove to higher and higher plains of pleasures knowing from experience how best to please her mistress. She felt Mistress Clarisse&#8217;s body begin to shake and quiver. She tasted the changes in Clarisse&#8217;s sex as she drew closer to the edge. Maggie&#8217;s body was almost one with that her mistress. It was as if her body felt each circle and flick of her tongue. The sharp sound of Clarisse&#8217;s hands repeated slapping Maggie&#8217;s breasts joined her moans and Maggie&#8217;s muffled screams. Maggie&#8217;s own pleasure being drawn form the pleasure she was creating in Clarisse. The blows sent waves of throbbing pleasure through her as her breasts began to turn red and from the blows. Her mistress plunged into the abyss that she craved for herself. Maggie joining her in her mind even though her body still craved its chance to join her in the white bliss.
Maggie felt her mistress&#8217;s body begin to spasm above her. She fought to keep the moist hardness of her tongue buried deep in the folds of Clarisse&#8217;s sex as the waves past. She slowly started to lick the wet folds once again as her mistress recovered. Beginning to lick in earnest again as she tasted the excitement returning. 
Clarisse continued to ride Maggie&#8217;s tongue through the waves of ecstasy that Maggie created in her, returning to the abyss repeatedly until the relentless waves became too painful to ride and she climbed free of slave.
Maggie&#8217;s jaws and tongue ached and her body covered in sweet. She just lay still bound and aching from the hog tie as panted for breath. 
Before she had a chance to recover, Clarisse pushed Maggie onto her stomach and then pulled her up by her bonds until she was on her knees. Once on her knees, Clarisse pushed her face down into the mattress of the bed. Fingers plunged into her sopping wet sex. They pulled free and returned to coat her ass hole before plunging into her still tender ass. The fingers fled her body as quickly as they had appeared.
Maggie lust was becoming overwhelming as her body was once again answered the siren&#8217;s call. Her master&#8217;s cock returned to her. This time it stretched her asshole. Its entrance into her depths was slow and patient. His cock stretched her a little at time. It entered her and then retreated in small thrusts. Each thrust drove into her a little deeper than the last.
Master fucked her with a controlled passion letting his lust rebuild after his recent release. He let himself experience all of her as he took his pleasure. Sometimes slowing and driving into her wetness without letting her body feel the contact with his body. She desperately wanted more. She wanted to feel his body slapping against pussy and to wrap her legs around him and pull him into her. She wanted to force his cock into her depths deeper and harder. 
He couldn&#8217;t describe the pleasure he took from feeling her arse spasm around his cock, from watching her body pull and strain against her bounds, and the grunts and moans that escaped her lips as her chest heaved in desperation. All of his senses focused on experiencing her ecstasy. His passions mixed with hers until the sensations of her jerking shaking body seemed to be apart of his own. Their heat grew and blended into an unquenchable fire. The feel of her muscles trembling around his manhood feeding an inferno that engulfed him with need once again.
Maggie was lost in the sensations once again. Her face and breasts felt as if they unbearably driven into hard luxury of the fabrics while her muscles ached from her bonds, and her service. Her ass was burning from the intrusion of her master&#8217;s cock into her depths. The burning sensation moved like a fire into her sex driving her closer to the edge of the abyss. 
Her body was acting on instincts as she felt everything and nothing at once. Her mind waited for the voice to find her in the fog of light. She had to wait for the voice to tell her that it was ok to succumb to the need. 
�I&#8217;m trying master. I cannot stay longer. Please let me cum? Please, do not make me stay longer. I need to fall..neeed to go�� She spoke the words but it was like a dream and she didn&#8217;t know if she had spoken them aloud or only in her mind.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;His knew that he could not deny his needs much longer. He felt himself thrusting faster and harder. The needs of his body became more urgent. He reached forward and grabbed Maggie by the hair leaning forward as he pulled her head back. He struggled to speak the words as her moans fuelled his hunger until he was all but lost. 
�Cum for me. Cum now sweet one!� It was the voice. That wonderful powerful commanding voice had freed her and her body obeyed. Her entire body began to spasm in answer to the call her juices flowing from her sex as the waves returned to her.
He felt her body obey him. His own body pulling him into her depths again and held her as he proclaimed his ownership over this gift so freely given. She felt his cock pulsing inside her as she rode the waves into the light that brought her dreams. Feeling a since of pride and joy at knowing that she had brought her master such bliss.












Chapter 9

 
The light slowly returned to her eyes. Her thoughts returned to her as the blindfold was removed by Clarisse and the straps where being removed by Master Antonio. Her body still felt the ripples of pleasure.
�Oh my God! She said and started to giggle. Her body felt the aching and wariness of her limbs, as they again tasted freedom. 
&#8216;That was sooooo good. Thank you Master. Thank you, Mistress.�
Antonio tossed the straps to the floor, leaned over, and took Maggie&#8217;s chin in his hand. He turned her head and kissed her deeply. Her eyes closed and relished the tenderness of the moment.
&#8216;I&#8217;m glad that you enjoyed it sweet one.� He said lightly slapping her bare ass with the flat of his hand. It sounded harsher then it was. &#8216;Now get dressed. You have chores to do. Slave to us or not you are still the chambermaid of the Countess de la Fountaine. You must never forget it.�
�No sir, I won&#8217;t.�
Master smiled at her once again and gave her bare ass another swat with the flat of his hand the sound echoing of the walls of his bedroom.
�Now go.�
 She giggled again and grabbed her clothes from the floor next to the bed. Still feeling flushed from her orgasm and service to her master and mistress she got dresses. She watched with more then a little admiration as her mistress dressed along with her. Clarisse had a toned body. Years of physical labor on the estate had made it tough but it was still soft with the natural curves of a woman.
She turned her gaze from Clarisse to Antonio. She had never seen his body in the light of day before. Covered by his shirt or hidden behind the darkness of a blindfold, it was still a mystery to her eyes. Her elation turned to wonder before becoming heartbreak. 
Antonio&#8217;s body was a labyrinth of scars. Lines crisscrossed his back and chest in a tapestry that told a tale of unimaginable pain and suffering. She was horrified at the sight of them for the briefest of moments. The horror became awe. She watched as he dressed. The scars shaped themselves to his movements. It was as if the scars themselves had succumbed to his strength and now bent to his will. She realized that the strength in his voice was but a reflection of the strength that lived in his soul. He held the strength to overcome tremendous pain, adversities, and suffering. He harnessed them like a team of horses and used them to pull him ever forward. 
The scars were old. She knew that for him they were always present. Antonio&#8217;s body apart from the scars reflected a life of hard labor. It was strong and muscular in a way that only comes from hard manual labor. Even so, his place as the house governor had given him the chance to add on a few extra pounds.&nbsp; His large frame and broad chest hid them well.&nbsp; 
She was in awe as practically floated from the room as she set about her chores. She desperately wanted to ask mistress Clarisse about the scars and to learn about her master but she knew that it was not the time or place. Instead, Maggie threw herself into her labors with relish finding secret and erotic meaning in each task. Her heart filled with joy. She found herself singing and even dancing as she worked to complete her work. Despite them all, what she truly desired was to back in the dungeon tied to the wooden table that a part of her had decided was home to her soul. 
She finished dusting only slightly annoyed at the hands that hand been making marks in the dust on the tabletops and fetched a bucket of soapy water along with a strong horsehair brush. She crawled on her hands and knees and scrubbed the bedroom floor. Each push of the brush across the floor caused her breasts to sway beneath her. Her nipples rubbed against the fabric of her dress with every sideways pass. Every splash of water from her wash bucket reminded her of Clarisse. She pictured Clarisse in her mind bound above her own trapped body. She felt Clarisse&#8217;s juices dripping down on her hot skin. Maggie&#8217;s dress become wet both from the water of the bucket and brush splashing against it and her own dripping sex. The hard wooden base of the brush reminded her of the hardness of the dungeon table and the hardness of her master&#8217;s cock and the hardness of his scarred body. She pushed and pulled it across the floor and wished that her hands where holding and stroking his cock. 
She found herself pulling the brush back farther then what was necessary so that she could press the backs of her hands and the hard edge of the brush against the mound of her pussy. She spread her knees apart even widen to make more room for her private assault on her sex. The act of scrubbing the floors became for her a private erotic dance. Her breasts swayed. Her nipples rubbed. The water splashed. Her sex dripped. Her knuckles turned white from holding onto the handle desperately.&nbsp; Her breathing became more and more labored. Each part of her body and step in the process of scrubbing the floor became an instrument in her mind. Together they became a symphony that played while her mind painted a picture of her back home on the hard table in the darkness of the dungeon. 
�Mmmmmmm.. yes... so hot.. so very very wet..&nbsp; so wanting.� It was as if a part of her had freed itself from the trappings of her own mind and moved away to watch. It spoke lust-filled words of encouragement. It chanted them in time with the symphony that beat inside her body. Ever slap of the brush, every sway of her breast moving the orchestra closer to the finale. Still that deep powerful voice would return to her mind and tell her no. 
Time passed blindly and without thought as she worked her way across the marbled floors that were in her care. She wanted to touch herself... to feel the slickness of her sex, and to make herself cum, but she knew that her master had forbidden it.
 �Only a small touch� that would suffice... yes, just the small sliding touch of her finger against her clit? So needed so wanted.. that would make her cum? Surely, no one would see? No one would know?� The lilting chanting voice of an alter ego called her.
 Still the powerful deep voice of her master echoed in her mind and kept her hands tightly clenching the handle of the scrub brush. That she could not made her want to even more. Dam him!
�Ahhhh.. even the frustration drives me closer. Only days ago I had been a slave bought and sold. Blindly content in my daily existence and now what have I become?� Her thoughts tried to calm her and block out the orchestra that kept calling to her.&nbsp; �I have made myself a slave to a slave and for what?�
She knew what she had gained pleasure beyond her imagining and more. She had gained power and freedom. Power because it was her choice and hers to take back. 
She had found freedom in slavery before but not at first. She had blamed herself for her plight. She had thought that perhaps if she had been a better daughter her parents would have chosen to keep her. Perhaps if she had been a better helper, done more, worked harder somehow her parents would have been able to keep her. Her family would have prospered more and she would have been able to stay.
Clarisse had told her when she first came to the estate that it was fate. It was the way of things as she held her in the dark and stroked her hair as she cried. When she had grown more accustomed to her new life she found that she liked not having to be the one responsible for taking care of the her brother, her sisters, the inn when her father drank to much ale or her mother after she had entertained a traveler in the night. There was freedom in not having to decide the fate of others and freedom in not having to decide on her own fate. Now she had found freedom by giving away her own guilt. She need not feel shame or guilt for the pleasures that her body experienced for it was her master and her mistress that made her body feel and do the things that now consumed her. When they where just fantasies her mind accused herself of all kinds of evils for thinking and feeling them.
Had she been less distracted perhaps she would have paid more attention to her labors or to the increased levels of activity in the house. Instead she listened to the symphony, the siren song, debated her choices and most of all thought of the abyss. She lost herself in thoughts of pain and the pleasures that she had learned the pain could bring. They were such sweet thoughts. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The carefree indulgence of her memories and thoughts reflected in her body as she worked. They were indulgences that would pass unnoticed.&nbsp; Master Antonio enjoyed his pleasures but he was had not achieved such freedoms by being idle, careless, or self-indulgent. He made sure that Clarisse knew her duties as Maggie&#8217;s mistress. 
It drew no notice from Sophia who was a housemaid along with Clarisse when Clarisse asked her to keep a watchful eye out for Maggie. Sophia was the oldest of the four maids and had been at the estate the longest. She had long straight hair that hung to her arse. Her breasts were large with big dark nipples. The other servants secretly joked about them because when they got hard from the cold or for any other reason the became as thick and long as the end of the other maid&#8217;s fingers. The smartest or most capable she was not, but once given a task and having learned it, she was as reliable as the sun was to rise in the morning to complete it. If Clarisse asked, it was for a reason and Clarisse had asked. Sophia therefore made an effort to be more watchful of Maggie as the day progressed. 
Sophia&#8217;s day passed with nothing unusual disturbing it as she completed her choirs. It wasn&#8217;t until the afternoon started to pass into evening that she actually found herself passing by Maggie. Maggie was on her hands and knees scrubbing the mistress&#8217;s hardwood floors when she passed by the open door. Mindful of Clarisse&#8217;s request she stopped and watched through the doorway as Maggie scrubbed. 
Maggie had an odd way of scrubbing the floors she thought. Sophia felt her face begin to flush as she realized that with each backward pull of the brush the top of the brush would slap against Maggie&#8217;s body more specifically against her crotch. The expression on Maggie&#8217;s face was one of delight rather then pain, and Sophia found her nipples beginning to harden under her dress. She found herself a little envious of Maggie&#8217;s creativity. She quietly retreated down the hall that she had just come and began to search for Clarisse. 
Exact in her attention to detail, and was ever mindful of her duties. She demonstrated both as she recounted Maggie&#8217;s methodology of scrubbing the floors. Clarisse seemed not to notice the hardness of her nipples or the flush in her cheeks as she tattled on Maggie and was only mildly surprised at her news.
Clarisse dismissed her with a thanks and kiss on the cheek. Sophia bowed and turned to walk away when Clarisse stepped behind her and put her arms around Sophia. Clarisse pulled her ample body back to her before beginning to fondle Sophia&#8217;s still hard nipples through her dress. Sophia froze. She closed her eyes and began to pant from want. 
Sliding one hand down her stomach until she could caress the mound of Sophia&#8217;s pussy through her dress, Clarisse leaned forward and whispered into Sophia&#8217;s ear. �Continue to be as diligent in your duties to me and I&#8217;ll give you a special reward. Would you like that?�
�Yes, Miss Clarisse, I would like that very much.� Sophia groaned in reply.
Clarisse released her hold on Sophia much to Sophia&#8217;s disappointment. �Go on now. We&#8217;ll see how you do in the next little while.�
Sophia took a moment to collect her self. �I&#8217;ll do my very best for you miss Clarisse.�
�I know you will Sophia. You can take the rest of the night off.�
�Thank you Miss Clarisse.� 
Clarisse smiled a wicked smile and marveled again at the size of Sophia&#8217;s hardened nipples before starting down the hallway towards countess Fountaine&#8217;s bedroom.
Sophia made a hastily retreat to her room feeling pleased with her self for a job well done. She quickly closed the door to her room. She pulled her dress over her head, blew out the candle next to her bed and climbed under the covers. Spreading her legs apart even before the flame blew out she plunged three fingers into her drenched pussy. She pictured herself on her hands and knees scrubbing the floors with her newly discovered technique. Clarisse standing above her with her legs spread and her dress pulled up to expose her sex. She relentlessly drove her fingers into her depths letting the palm of her hand slap against the mound of her pussy as she imagined it was the hardness of the brush. Clarisse&#8217;s voice saying, �Come get your reward.� Her toes curled and her body shuttered as her orgasm washed over her. She decided that she definitely needed to try that for herself.
&nbsp; Maggie finished the floors and the rest of her chores a little latter then normal. She was hot, horny, and very hungry. Her face wore a mischievous little grin as she went to the kitchen. Clarisse watched from the end of the hall and followed her at a distance unobserved.
Nicolas was an excellent cook and a man of some exploits in the sexual arena both were areas of pride for him. He had always hoped that Maggie would someday be one of those exploits. When Maggie entered the kitchen he again felt that God had chosen to bless him above most men. She was a vision of perfection. Her hair was tussled from work her dress was soaked in the front and her nipples were hard and clear against the wet fabric, even the mound of her pussy held the wetness of the fabric close. She smiled a warming smile and crossed the floor to Nicolas. Her hips swayed just a bit more then usual, and her steps carrying a little extra bounce.&nbsp; She had a feminine confidence that made it self know in that bounce and the sway of her breasts. Aware of her body and the power her womanhood carried more then ever before.
�Sweet Nicolas I&#8217;ve been working so hard today and missed the staff meal. Could you pleaassseeeee let me have something to get me through the night?� she said as sweetly as honey. She twisted some strands of hair around her fingers and completed the question with a slight bite of lower lip.
Nicolas found the hardness of his cock becoming uncomfortable. This was a moment that he had hoped and even prayed would happen. He didn&#8217;t pray much and wasn&#8217;t really sure that this was a moment he should have been asking God to experience.
Unfortunately, the moment was bitter sweet. Antonio had visited him earlier in the afternoon. He had made it clear that he specifically was not to grant Maggie any special privileges from the kitchen regardless of any enticements that might seem to present themselves. Antonio knew all about Nicolas&#8217; and his exploits. He was not going to have his new pet wasted on the likes of the cook.
Maggie stared in disbelief as Nicolas shifted restlessly in front of her and told her no. She lowered her head and looked up at Nicolas with puppy dog eyes, �But I&#8217;m so hungry and your sooo good at what you do. Can&#8217;t you just let me have something?�
She put her hands on her stomach for emphasis. The action only helped to pull the wet fabric of her dress tighter against her hard nipples.
He desperately wanted to let her have something, but he had been around the estate a time or two. Antonio had not become the governor by chance. He could be hard and ruthless. Despite his natural inclinations, he resisted. He feared Antonio to much. Instead, he stiffened his shoulders just a bit and told her that he had been too lenient with her already.
She couldn&#8217;t believe his change of position especially towards her! Still, she could tell his cock was hard, and she was still to horny and to hungry to relent. She slid one hand down a just a little lower until it rested just above the mound of her pussy as she let her other hand move across her body and up her other arm. Her bent arm pushed her breasts up and increasing the strain against the fabric. She bit her lip once more. 
�You&#8217;re not going make me go hungry are you?�
Dam the governor. Nicolas thought. Times are changing and it is time to seize the day.
�Well, I suppose a little something won&#8217;t hurt.� He said. He moved closer to Maggie and slid his hand across her stomach until it slid under her own as he stepped behind her. Maggie was thinking that she might have pushed Nicolas just a little far, but a part of her liked the feel of his hand sliding across her stomach. She like having it so close to her wet pussy. She closed her eyes and waited.
Maggie&#8217;s eyes flew open as Nicolas cried out and he crumbled to the floor.
Antonio had entered the kitchen unnoticed with Clarisse at his side. He struck Nicolas just under his rib cage with a savage blow that drove the wind from Nicolas&#8217; lungs, and sent him to the floor. 
Maggie didn&#8217;t have time to react as Nicolas fell away from her. Clarisse was on her in an instant. She grabbed her by the back of her hair and her arm behind her back. Clarisse pushed her out of the kitchen an into the hall. Maggie screamed partially from the pain in her arm and from her pulled hair but mostly out of fear. Clarisse let go of her arm, spun her around, and slapped her across the face. The blow sent bursts of light into her eyes as tears began streaming down her cheeks. A burning heat began to fill her skin where Clarisse&#8217;s hand had struck. 
Pulled by her hair, Maggie found herself following Clarisse towards the dungeon door. She still wasn&#8217;t even sure what had even happened. She only had time to see the imposing form of Master Antonio standing over poor Nicolas. 
A part of her felt guilty for what had happened to Nicolas. Another part felt beautiful and powerful. Nicolas had always given her special treatment. The way an adult gives special treatment to a child.&nbsp; The kind that makes you smile because of how happy it makes them. This time it had been different. It was what a man shows to a woman. She was a woman and she had begun to realize the power that being her sexuality inherently held, but she lusted for those that could control and harness that power in her. Just like she relished the freedom from guilt.
Pulled ever forward by her hair, she was reminded that Clarisse was one of those that knew how to control that power. Maggie&#8217;s body responded to her automatically. Her nipples hardened and her pussy became wet. Her breathing began to shallow and she could feel her heartbeat pounding in her chest. Her bare feet began to descend the cold stone steps towards the dungeons depths. She could smell the sulfur from the burning torches and the growing scent of feminine arousal. The feel of the stone, the pain in her head, and the sensations growing inside her body where enhanced by the memories of the days before. She felt herself cum as she walked. Not the sweet release that she had been fantasying about all day, it was instead the softer tremors that once felt only seemed to tease you into wanting more.
Clarisse's strong hand forced her down into the depths that she had been craving. They passed through the dungeon doors together before Clarisse pushed her forward into the center of the room.
�Strip slut. I want you naked now.�
The harshness command made Maggie jump slightly and sent a shudder through her incensed frame.
Clarisse&#8217;s voice was as cold as the stone of the walls, but Maggie welcomed it and hurried to strip and before throwing her cloths into a pile against the wall.
&nbsp; �Get on the table, and lie on your back.�
&nbsp; Her nipples were hard and beginning to ache and she could feel her juices flowing from her sex as she climbed onto the table.
&nbsp; Clarisse didn't speak as she moved towards Maggie.
&nbsp; She took a wooden pole and tied it between Maggie&#8217;s wrists forcing them apart.
&nbsp; Maggie&#8217;s heart began to rush at the thought of what next for her.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp; Clarisse then secured the pole to the strap hanging from the beam above. The same strap and beam that Maggie had used to bind herself days before. 
Clarisse smiled a small evil smile as she secured a strap too Maggie&#8217;s right ankle. She pulled Maggie&#8217;s ankle up with the strap and secured it to the pole so that her right wrist and ankle where touching.
�Oh my God.. !!!&nbsp; Yes!� Maggie screamed the word in mind. She was already loosing herself to the passions that had taken over her life.
&nbsp; Clarisse smiled again as she returned to the end of the table with another strap and repeated the procedure with her other ankle.
&nbsp; Maggie could still feel the hardness of the cold table against the small of her back and the top of her ass but her asshole and pussy were fully exposed and her breast where pushed together by her thighs.
Clarisse ran her hand over Maggie&#8217;s inner thigh passing to the side of her sex before reaching between her splayed legs and roughly pulling and shifting Maggie&#8217;s breasts as she made sure that Maggie&#8217;s aching nipples were equally available o her whim.
Maggie could already feel the tingling in her fingertips as the circulation slowed but still let enough blood flow to keep her from harm. She waited for the blind fold and the pain. She wanted it desperately and did not caring why it came.
Clarisse moved to the wall and returned to the end of the table with a two meter long stripped willow branch.
It was the first time since her capture by Antonio in her mistress&#8217;s bedroom that a sense of fear began to creep into her thoughts.
�Mistress what about the blind fold?�
�Shut up slut. There will be no blindfold this time. Master gave you a warning before you left his chamber. What was it?�
�Uuuuhhhh...� 
�He told you to remember whose chambermaid you were. You seem to have forgotten already. You cleaned like you've never set your hands to the task.�
The willow branch that previously rested against the wall whistled through the air.
Maggie had started to say I'm sorry mistress but it was replaced by a scream.
She found to catch her breath, �I was... just...�
The willow branch whistled again as it arced through the air and hit the back of Maggie&#8217;s thigh. Maggie screamed again as the pain shot through her body.
Her mind kept trying to form the words, �I was just so happy at the thought of master and you and what we shared.� They where never uttered as the whistling arc of the willow branch began to blend into the screams that replaced Maggie&#8217;s words. Crimson strips creating pattern of interwoven lines up and down the backs of her legs. 
Clarisse had withheld some of the force but Maggie couldn't tell. The pain of each blow was searing and instant. Finally, the whistle of the willow branch fell silent. The dungeon filled with the thunderous sounds of Clarisse&#8217;s labored breathing, Maggie&#8217;s sobbing and the dripping of the water from the wall into the pail below. Clarisse walked to the bucket took a ladle from a wall hook. She scooped out some water and drank her fill before bringing a ladle full to Maggie to drink.
�You must always remember who owns you sweet one.�
Maggie&#8217;s breath was still coming in bursts as she tried to focus through the pain. When she was finally able to speak it was only a desperate whisper.
�I will mistress. I swear it won't happen again.�
�It will not sweet one. I will make sure.�
Clarisse stepped away and the awful sound of the willow whistling through the air returned. The blows began to rain down again moving up and down the backs of her legs in random patterns.
Each blow was as searing as the first.
Maggie&#8217;s mind began to loose itself in the flashes of pain.
The searing burn of the willow passed from pain into a rhythmic heat that flowed from her every point of the crimson streaks to her sex, and mind in flashes. 
Even now, lost in the pain, the dark part of her wanted to be touched. Its dark magic changing the sea of pain into one of superheated passion. It wanted to be touched. It wanted her hands free to touch her herself. It wanted Clarisse to touch her so badly... ooooohhhhh god, yes to be touched now...�
The blows became waves in her ocean of lust. She could feel herself moving closer to the white abyss driven by the flashes of fire from the willow. The waves pushing her closer until just before she pasted in the abyss the blows stop.
�Noooooooo....,� she screamed it again and again desperate for more, desperate for the abyss. 
The searing heat slowly turning to pulses of pain. That pushed her farther from the pleasure that had been so close. 
Clarisse left Maggie to her own recovery as she went to the wall for more straps. She climbed onto the table above Maggie revealing to Maggie her own wet sex, and the scent of her lust.
Maggie recovered her senses during the respite and opened her eyes. Her eyes blinked against the torchlight and the light layer of smoke that hung in the air to see Clarisse&#8217; exposed sex wet and open before her. �God.. Yes.. ... Yes..,� The words rushing into her mind with thoughts of tasting her mistress. 
Maggie began to beg. She begged for forgiveness. She begged for mercy. She begged to please her. She begged until the words were nothing but a rambling incoherent babble.
&nbsp; Clarisse continued to work with the straps above Maggie, refusing to look down at her slave. Her sex desperately wanted the gift of her master&#8217;s lust.
&nbsp; Clarisse&#8217;s own nipples were aching, and her sex was dripping as she fed her own lust. Maggie begged beneath her.
�Please.... Please...... oohhhh&nbsp; god please... mistress please...�
 Maggie didn&#8217;t know that Clarisse had been forbidden from taking her own pleasures from her slave until her masters return. Knowing the punishment that would await her Clarisse focused on the straps and completing her task. She climbed from the table returned with Maggie&#8217;s clothes.
�NOOOooooooooo...... please... pretty please. I'm begging you.�
The clothes had been soaked in the cold water of the bucket and were now soaked through. Clarisse climbed onto the table again and tied the wet clothes above Maggie with the straps that she had placed there only moments before.
Maggie could feel the water dripping down on her. Drop by cold drop.
The drops fell on her burning skin in excruciating bursts of cold relief before turning to fire as each drop traced a path down the backs of her pain-filled legs.
Clarisse climbed free of the table and without a word and walked to the dungeon&#8217;s door before closing it behind her with a finality that seemed to crush all hope in the room.
The echo of the closing door left the room silent again except for Maggie&#8217;s breathing and the sound of those damn drops of water into the once delicious bucket. The cold drops still falling relentlessly onto her burning skin.
&nbsp; �Oohhhh god ... please... do not leave me like this..� 
&nbsp; Maggie let her head fall back. She was too tired to hold it up any longer. Her thoughts returned to the numbness in her fingers and toes and the pain that pulsed with each drop through her fevered skin.
The cold drops began to form rivulets that rolled down the backs of her legs to brush against the fire that filled the lips of her sex and down to her asshole before forming a puddle on the table beneath her.
Her thoughts turned from the pain to her failure.
She had failed the moment that she was had been freed to her own thoughts. Her eyes began fill with tears. Her mind lost in her failure, and the disappointment that she had brought to her master and mistress. Soon the power of her thoughts replaced the torment of the water and all that her body felt.
 She sobbed until she could sob no more. Her tears dried, and all seemed lost. She hung in the flickering light of the torches until her clothes after her clothes had ceased their dripping torment. She had long since closed her eyes to the torch light, and she began to feel alone. It was here in the mists of her despair that the light returned.
It returned in the form of a kiss. A soft sweet gentle kiss brushed against the heat of her legs like the wings of a butterfly. The kisses returned, moving their velvet touch up and down the flaming heat of her legs.
She lifted her head and opened her eyes to see the flicker of light across her master&#8217;s face. The flames made his eyes sparkle as he watched her and kissed her.
Her eyes filled with shame and tears returned to them as she felt the weight of her own disappointment come crashing down on her again. His kisses stopped their dance as he reached forward and brushed the tears from her cheeks.
Her lips said, I&#8217;m sorry master, but the words were only sobs. Her body shuttered as it fought against her bonds.
His voice, that voice that capture and filled her heart returned in soft reassurance.
�Your punishment is finished sweet one. With the last drop of water came forgiveness. You will remember your owners and your master and need never fear for I have already forgotten the trespass.�
Her tears flowed still but now in joy as he words restored her heart.
His kisses returned to the heat of her legs and turned the aching tenderness of her bruised skin into an unquenchable flame of passion surging through her once again. 
His kisses were sweet agony as they tenderly and slowly covered ever inch of her legs and inner thighs. They continued moving down towards her sex passing over her inflamed swollen lips until his tongue pushed forward against her ass. His tongue teased her ass before it slid upward and pushed the lips of her pussy apart moving relentlessly towards the hardness of her clit. Her body shook as her entire being felt each moment of his tongue&#8217;s movement. She strained against her bonds un-breathing abandoning all reason. 
When his tongue touched her clit it was like a flash of raw savage heat unleashed like a lighting bolt branching from horizon to horizon viscously throwing her over the edge into the abyss with a power beyond any that she experienced, and until all was gone.
Her master released her from her bounds. She moaned in protest as circulation was restored to her fingers and toes but she didn&#8217;t wake. He carried her up the secret passage to his bed where he laid her down and covered her still trembling body. It was there that she remained until her mind returned to her and she awoke again.












Chapter 10

The night&#8217;s activities had brought a deep sense of peace and comfort to Maggie. She snuggled under the covers and dreamed sweet dreams of captivity and passion.
The Antonio could not say the same. After he had tucked Maggie into his bed for the night, he lit a lone candle on his writing desk, and sat in his chair and watched Maggie sleep. That is where he remained until sunrise. He sat unmoving. His arms rested on the arms of the chair as he watched her shift beneath the covers, and listened to the sweet sound of her gentle breathing as she sleep. For a little while, her activity kept his attention but as the candle burned down his thoughts turned to the kitchen and to Nicolas.
Antonio had a strong distaste for violence. He had had his share of it as a child, and as he grew, he had discovered the power that comes from knowledge.
It wasn&#8217;t that he particularly was beaten. That came with captivity. He had been quick tempered and small for his age. Had he been bigger things may well have turned out very differently, but why ponder what wasn&#8217;t.
He like most boys was prone to fight. His brothers had liked to joke on him and would do so until his patience snapped. He would fly into a rage that was blind and he would strike out without prejudice. Older and bigger his brothers would simply keep him at arms length but he found ways to get to them. They laughed at him until in his rage he would hurt them.
Hurt by the wild upstart, they would hit him. He just wouldn&#8217;t feel it. His rage was such; the pain would pass unfelt unfelt. It took a surprisingly great deal of force to stop an enraged Antonio. When the rage ended Antonio&#8217;s regret would begin. It would latter be the ability to regret hurting another that let him believe that God must be as real as the unseen air. Compassion for an enemy doesn&#8217;t exist in the animal realm. It is unique to man.
Feeling unwanted and angry, Antonio started to wander the streets of the city. He studied the people that frequented the town square the women coming to the market, and the vendors as they plied their trades. Even, the whores as they men fucked them over the backs of the wagons, and while they sucked cocks in the alleyways. He watched as some men treated them like trash. Some men called them like dogs with no name and would push them over a hitching post or bent them over behind a building. Working men with dirty hand and stained teeth that grabbed them by the hair and pulled their skirts up. They would pull there sweaty cocks out and fucked them for a minute or two and grunt as they came in �its� cunt or arse. They would step back throw a sou on the ground and walk away while they pushed their shriveling wet dicks back into their trousers all without a word.
Other men would come to partake of the lady&#8217;s services as well. Gentle with fine clothes, they would take their whores to inns. Antonio would study them too watching them through the slats of the windows. Some gentle of refinement would do nothing but talk or cuddle like babies. Others would cum in their trousers before they could get their dicks out of their finery.
These men, the whores would laugh at when their fee was paid and the men where gone. The whores would laugh, mock, and curse the men who paid them. If the man had been to un-towards young Antonio would study the whores as they comforted each other in ways that only another could.
There where other men that came to call on the whores of the town square. Men that the women didn&#8217;t mock. They were men that the whores wanted and sometimes fought for the opportunity to fuck. Men who&#8217;s cocks where sucked. Men who&#8217;s cum was swallowed gladly, and were fucked without having been asked for a liard. These were the men that he studied the most. 
He was a quick study with a quick temper, alone, and left to feed his own wants as he found means. Antonio turned to stealing what he wanted. It started as food for his hunger and became money for his leisure.
He curiosity changed as he matured. He found himself aroused and curiosity became passion and lust. He found himself in love with a young girl named Jolene. 
Jolene was a cast away who turned to the streets to live. Her looks and charm could get a � Lious for a fuck. She fucked when she had too. She lived life when she had the money and took to a young street rat named Antonio. Neither of them could read nor write.
Sitting in his chair in the candle light Antonio remembered her as if she was standing in front of him. Her long brown hair, deep brown eyes, full lips and young full breasts were as real to his mind as the chair in which he sat. She had a smile that was disarming, and her zeal for life made her seem innocent and yet sensuous at the same time. He thought of how alike Jolene and Maggie were and prayed in his own way that the similarities of last night would not herald a similar fate.
Antonio was a puppet at Jolene&#8217;s beautiful feet. She was his first love and his first lover. He knew what she was just as she knew who he was. It mattered to both but only because it meant that they understood each other and it made the trust in one another even greater. 
It was a warm summer night just a few weeks after they had first become lovers that his life, his very being changed forever. 
They were lying together in the bed of the Inn �Fleur de Farine.� The room paid for by a young count that had only needed it for a few moments. Jolene was laying on Antonio&#8217;s chest her heart beating into him. Her hair draped softly over his arm as he held her close. She rolled over on top of him as the moonlight filled the room and made her look to him like a goddess. She proper herself up on hands and looked into his eyes for what seemed to him an eternity before she spoke.
�Do you love me?� her words were soft and full of the warmth that still lingered from their passions.
�Yes, I love you.� His words were soft but full of confidence and depth. She smiled and laid her head back down on his chest.
�Do you love me?� he asked in return. 
She was silent for a moment before answering. �I don&#8217;t know.� She said. 
Despite all the years that had past he still remembered how he felt at that moment. He had thought that she loved him as much as he her.
Thinking back on that night he decided she must have felt his body tighten beneath her. She lifted herself off his chest and sat up on her knees. Her body was straddling his legs. She smiled again, now a playful mischievous smile.
�Do you love me?� she asked again.
Antonio looked into her eye&#8217;s again. How silly he thought. How could she be sure? He could simply be another man wanting to use her for his pleasures. He could just be using means other than to get it from her.
�I love you, absolutely and with all my being. I could deny you nothing.�
She slid her hands down his stomach and began to stroke his hardening cock. �Are you sure there&#8217;s nothing that you would not deny me?�
�Nothing.�
�I want you to bind me and spank me.�
�I would hurt you. I would do anything but that. I could not hurt you, never!�
�I didn&#8217;t say hurt, I said spank. There&#8217;s a difference.�
He had watched men spank the whores of the square before but had thought them harsh and it beyond the ability to be enjoyed. She bit her lower lips and pouted a little, even as she continued to stroke his cock.
�I&#8217;ll be your captive slave. You bind me and spank me for trying to flee. Fulfill this fantasy for me and you can have my arse to fuck. It will be for you and you alone.�
She was an experienced fuck, and had a magical mouth, but he knew that her arse was still virginal. She had not said that she loved him but the gift of her virgin arse in his mind said it for her.
He pushed her off him and onto the side of the bed. Jumping off the bed he grabbed the sash from her dress and with the speed of street thief he came at her again. She wrestled with and pretended to beg for mercy, but he easily pushed her back onto her stomach and tied her wrists together with the sash.
He stood up. His cock harder then ever and more exited then he had ever been. She was on the bed her wrists tied behind her back her legs slightly spread. He could see her chest heaving from excitement and the lips of her pussy opened and wet.
He pulled the belt from his trousers and moved back behind her. She had pushed herself up onto her knees with her face lying on the bed.
He so wanted to bring the belt down. The excitement in him was beyond what he had ever imagined, but he didn&#8217;t want to hurt her. He swung the belt and brought it down on her arse but he had held back most of the force. The sound of the belt striking and the sound of her moan made his heart skip a beat.
�Yes.. harder please. I need it harder.� The next blow was harder and the next harder than the one before. Still she begged for more and for them to be harder. Even in the light of the moon he could see the marks raising from her arse. His cock was throbbing and desperate for her sex to the point of aching. Her begging stopped and turned into moans and her arse thrust itself back onto his belt.
He could take no more. He threw down the belt and grabbed her by her sides. He pulled her back to him and drove himself into her wet sex. He felt her body as it spasmed around his cock after only a few strokes. He pulled her back driving his cock deep inside her and held her there as her body shuddered beneath him.
�Gasping for breath she begged again.� Fuck my arse, please I want it to be your&#8217;s be please� please fuck my arse now��
He was beyond word or thought. All that existed was the lusts of her body and his own. He pulled his cock free of her sex and guiding it with one hand drove it into her arse. He wasn&#8217;t gentle lost in his passion, he simply drove his hardness into her tight hole. 
She screamed into the bedding as his cock forced its way inside her. Her body began to spasm again. Her hips pushing her back into him trying to drive him inside her even more, trying to let it fill her being. He drove himself into her and fucked her without thought. He pulled her back and held her his hands clenched tightly around her waste as he threw his head back and his body began to spam, his cum filling her arse.
He collapsed next her and fumbled to untie her bounds. They lay together silently as they recovered. That night was the first of many. It was their and theirs alone, a bond of trust lust, and even love.
 It lasted through the fall. They spent more time together and she fucked for the money less often. He stole more to keep them happy and they were happy.
It ended on a cold night. Jolene had decided to work the square after being told that the one of her regulars a bankers son had been trying to find her. He paid well more then the � Lious that she made from most.
Antonio had decided to work the square himself. The banker&#8217;s son arrived soon after Jolene did. Antonio watched from a distance. He felt uneasy. The banker&#8217;s son was drunk and big and seemed out of sorts. He paid for the usual room at the Flour de Flarine. Antonio abandoned his work to slip around the back and watched through the seams of the shuttered window.
A part of him hated that she fucked others but another part of him admired and thrilled at seeing how skillfully she could please men and at how much they lusted after her. He enjoying knowing that she would find leave to find him of her own free will. A gift they would never know.
It happened quickly. She had stripped a slow sensuous production and laid herself out on the bed for him. He had fumbled with his cloths and climbed on top of her. The man was a pig with money nothing more or less. He started to fuck her. Her body was under his. Antonio had trouble seeing everything as the man&#8217;s body was covering Jolene&#8217;s. Antonio didn&#8217;t realize that things were going terrible wrong until He saw her clenched fist striking at the man&#8217;s arms and back. Antonio began running. He crashed though the door of the inn to get to his love but he was too late. Her arms had fallen to her side limp and lifeless. The man looked up at Antonio as he crashed through the door his hands still clutching Jolene&#8217;s throat. 
Something snapped inside Antonio. He became something unreal and devoid of anything but rage. He eyes and heart went cold as he closed on the man. The rest of what happened was hard to remember. What he did remember he only remembered in pieces. He remembered hitting the man. He remembered the smell of the blood and the lifeless eye&#8217;s of the man. The gendarmes found him holding Jolene&#8217;s lifeless body before hauling him away.
He might have walked away and been left to his loss had the man he killed not been the son of a banker or Jolene something other than a whore. The only thing that saved him from the gallows was that Potential scandal that would have surrounded the banker had the entire event seen the light of day. Instead, other charges where manufactured and he was forced into debtor&#8217;s prison. It was there that the Count de la Fountaine bought him. The Count a past client of Jolene paid his dept out of pity. It didn&#8217;t dissuade his anger or grief. It was captivity still. 
His rage was not as engulfing when he entered the kitchen. His rage tempered with time and other things that he tried not to think about, but it was still rage. 
His first blow took the air from Nicolas&#8217; lungs, and the next snapped his head around and his fist hit his jaw. Nicolas blacked out and crumbled to the floor. There were other blows struck but they ended quickly. Antonio climbed on top of Nicolas and would have likely killed him but he stopped when he saw the glazed eyes of the cook beneath him.
Antonio replayed the two events, over and over in his mind as the candle burned down and Maggie slept. When she dreamed her hand would find her pussy to play out the dreams of her mind, but Antonio was lost in his own thoughts and didn&#8217;t notice.
The candle flickered out and he still sat unmoving in his chair. It wasn&#8217;t until the sun had started to fill the room with its morning light that Antonio stirred from his thoughts. He quietly left the room and found Clarisse to give her instructions for the day. Leaving her, he went on his way to attend to the estate and prepare it for the imminent return of its own owners.
