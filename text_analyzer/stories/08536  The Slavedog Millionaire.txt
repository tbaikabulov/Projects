The Old Friend, The Millionaire

Priya opened up her front door to an attractive young man dressed in formal attire. He spoke with a pleasantly eager tone. �Hi, Priya. I&#8217;m Rajat.�
�Rajat?� Priya said, scanning her memory banks. "I do remember your face but..."
�We studied together in school.�
�Oh, yeah. Rajat. Hi!� Priya smiled but kept a good distance from him.
�You remember me?�
�Of course I do. Wow, you look great. Come on in, we have much to catch up on.� She walked him in and showed him to her couch. �How did you find my place, anyway?�
�Oh you&#8217;d told me once in school, I just never forgot,� Rajat said. He placed his briefcase on the tea-table and settled in his seat. He stole a little glance at Priya&#8217;s smooth, slender legs. The elegant black dress she was wearing did apt justice to her shapely structure.
�Now, please don&#8217;t take this the wrong way. But you look�WOW!�
�Oh, thank you Rajat.�
�It&#8217;s like you&#8217;re getting prettier every day or something. I was just thinking how could the beauty queen Priya get any prettier than she was, but here you are!� Rajat said. "You're quite simply breathtaking!"
�Thank you.� Priya blushed slightly.
�A girl like you must have several admirers and boyfriends?�
�If you must know, I do have a boyfriend." Priya said. "His name&#8217;s Rahul.�
�He must be a wonderful man. I would love to meet him someday!� Rajat said, a genuine smile took over his face. �Anyway, what are you doing these days?�
�I&#8217;m studying medicine in Bangalore Medical College. I just finished my second year,� Priya said.
�And you still top your class, as always?�
Priya shrugged her shoulders. �Yeah, I came first this year. It&#8217;s like, why is everyone dumber than me, you know?�
�It's hardly possible for anyone to be smarter than you...�
�Thanks. Anyway, what are you up to?�
�I started a business right after school. It&#8217;s an online dating website. It&#8217;s doing very well now, got millions of users.� Rajat said.
�That&#8217;s a perfect fit for you. You&#8217;ve always been a computer geek,� Priya said.
Rajat lowered his head and maintained a straight glance towards her. �Um, Priya. There is a reason why I found my way here today."
"Tell me." Priya said.
"I&#8217;m rich. Like, very very rich.� Rajat said.
Priya nodded, �OK. That&#8217;s great. Why are you saying it like that?�
�I&#8217;m a millionaire. Even in terms of dollars.�
�That&#8217;s wonderful!�
�And I brought over two million dollars in cash, right here in this briefcase.� Rajat unlocked the briefcase and showed the stacks of cash to Priya.
�What? That&#8217;s dangerous. Why would you do something so crazy?�
�Priya, I thought I should finally return it to its rightful owner. Please take it, it&#8217;s for you.�
�All of this is for me?� Priya asked, looking at the massive amounts of money in the case. �Why would you give me so much money?�
"Priya," Rajat looked down at her feet. �Starting this business was hard. There were times when it looked like I&#8217;d never succeed. During those times I would just think of you. The very thought of you was the only thing that kept me going. So I owe you everything I have today.�
He pointed to the briefcase and waited patiently. Priya sat back in her seat, her eyes wide open and her jaws weak from the revelation. �Wow. I don&#8217;t know what to say.� She shook her head and paused for a few moments. �So you&#8217;re in love with me.�
�Yes, but I can never have you and I know that!� Rajat went on. �Priya, I bought a big house in Bhimanagar residential. That&#8217;s yours too. And my internet business��
Priya held up her hand and stopped him midway. �Rajat, I can&#8217;t accept all this.�
Rajat knelt down before Priya and placed his hands on the floor. �Priya, you deserve it all, you deserve to rule the world. Please accept it, for my sake.�
�But Rajat, I am still studying in college. I don&#8217;t think I should be handling these vast sums of money��
�Please Priya, I beg you...�
Priya stopped him and raised her forefinger. �First, you have to tell me what you want in return.�
Rajat bowed down. �I want nothing from you. If any of this stuff makes you happier, my life&#8217;s purpose is served.�
�So, all you want is to serve me?� Priya asked.
�Yes, Priya.�
�OK. Here&#8217;s what I&#8217;m going to do. I&#8217;ll accept everything you own and in return, you can work as one of my slaves.� Priya stated.
�A slave? What does that mean, Priya?� Rajat asked.
�Most of the time you&#8217;d be locked up in my cellar waiting for orders. I&#8217;ll use you to clean the car, the garden, the house &#8211; all of what used to be yours. And I&#8217;ll be moving to my new house soon.�
�I&#8217;m ready to be your slave, Priya. Use me as you wish.� Rajat declared, holding his head high. Priya stood over her new slave. 
�The very first thing I want to do is pay you back. I&#8217;ll give you one thing that&#8217;s worth more than everything you&#8217;ve given me, so I don&#8217;t feel like I owe you anything.�
�What is it, Priya?� Rajat looked up to her.
�Bring your head down and close your eyes,� Priya instructed. Rajat did as he was told. She walked around the millionaire, and then stepped up on his neck, letting her sharp, elegant heels sink into his tender flesh. She twisted her feet and dug further into his skin.
�Aah!� Rajat closed his eyes shut and allowed his body to flow into the cold ground. He smiled as he felt the sharp heels poking into his neck. His heart began to bubble from the warmth of being subdued by the woman of his dreams, the woman whose very presence elevated his soul to new highs. He was allowed the pleasure of her heels for mere seconds before she pulled back her legs and stood over him. He sat up and crossed the fingers of his right hands between those of his left, in a breathless worship.
�That was easily the best moment of my life, Priya.�
�I know.� Priya said.
�Thank you so much, Priya. That was certainly more valuable than anything I&#8217;ve given you, or could ever possibly give you.� Rajat said, his head swirling in stars of ecstasy.
�So I can safely say that I have paid you back? I don&#8217;t owe you anything?�
�You have overdone that, my Lady!� Rajat said. �Now I owe you. I will spend my life paying you back for that through servitude.�
�That&#8217;s good. Now drive me to my new house. I want to check it out now.� Priya said.

The Payback

Priya opened Rajat&#8217;s briefcase placed on her tea-table to check its contents. There were hundreds and hundreds of fresh bank notes, and each one was worth a thousand Rupees &#8211; the highest denomination available from a single note. The notes even carried the smell of freshly withdrawn money &#8211; pleasant but simultaneously evil.
�That was the greatest moment of my life, Priya! I can&#8217;t even imagine how I would thank you for something like that.�
�I&#8217;m looking at many millions of rupees in cash, right here in this briefcase.� Priya said.
�Yes, Priya. It&#8217;s all yours, it&#8217;s only yours.� Rajat said, closing his eyes. �And I will spend my life being a good slave to you.�
�Of course you will.� Priya said. �But I have to say that I still feel bad looking at all this money. You worked so many years��
�Five years, Priya.� Rajat explained, joining his hands and looking up to her with a smile like he&#8217;d seen God. �My online dating website took five years to succeed.�
�You struggled five years to earn this kind of money. I don&#8217;t feel very good about just taking it away from you like this.�
�But you deserve it, Priya.� Rajat said. �The only reason I was able to persist with the idea was the very thought of you- your beauty, your grace�� Rajat said.
�Stop it! You&#8217;re starting to sound a bit cheesy.� Priya said. Rajat sealed his lips shut. �I&#8217;ll tell you what &#8211; you hold on to your briefcase for a few more minutes.�
She handed him the open briefcase and he took it from her to set it down on the floor.
�Make a wish. Ask me for anything you truly want.�
�Priya, I&#8217;m supposed to be your slave.� Rajat said.
�Yes, but for a few minutes, I&#8217;m going to be the angel of your dreams.� Priya smiled. �Tell me what you&#8217;ve dreamed of and be honest!�
Rajat crawled closer to her seat on the couch. He brought his hands close to her feet. �May I?�
Priya nodded. He caught her feet in his hands and raised them up to his face. With a deep breath and closed eyes, he went forward to kiss the dusty bottoms of her elegant shoes. Within moments, his heart began pounding so hard that Priya could see the individual beats through his formal suit. He sniffed, licked and kissed every inch of her feet and shoes, then finished with a satisfied smile.
�My dreams have become true, Priya!�
�I can see that!� Priya laughed. He picked up the briefcase and placed it next to Priya. �Thank you so much, Rajat. But��
�What is it, Priya? Did I do something wrong?� Rajat asked.
�No, it&#8217;s just that my boyfriend is coming soon and I need to have you securely stowed away in the cellar before he arrives!�
�Sure, Priya. Lock me up. But can I ask only one more favor?�
�What is it?�
�Can I ride you to the cellar on my back?� He asked.
"Certainly." Priya instantly dropped herself on his back, grabbed on to his shoulder and placed her legs on either side of his body. He began to crawl on his hands and knees and made his way towards the stairs. �Priya, please slap my head and tell me to ride you faster.�
Priya caught his neck and swung her hand to deliver a hard slap to his head. �Giddiyap!� she ordered.
�Wow, that was absolutely perfect!�
Rajat crawled in through the basement door and once inside, Priya swiftly and expertly chained him up like a pet. �Priya, that was worth more than anything I could possibly give you,� Rajat said, passionately kissing her shoes. �I should be paying you much more than this, but my imagination fails me. It&#8217;s beyond me to even think of a way to show you my gratitude.�
�Of course,� Priya said. �So here&#8217;s what you&#8217;ll do as my slave. You&#8217;re going to continue running that website of yours, every day and giving me all the money you make from it.�
�Sure, Priya.� Rajat said. �Everything I have and will ever have is yours.� 
�Also, from now on you&#8217;re just like any of my other slaves. I don&#8217;t owe you anything.� Priya said. Rajat accepted with a nod and another kiss on her feet.
�Your job starts with being locked up in this room for several hours,� she said as she opened the cellar door and walked out, bolting the cellar door shut.

The Priya Mansion

 �I usually like surprises.� Rahul said, wrapping his arms around Priya as she drove her red sports car through the wide tarmac streets and the huge bungalows of Bhimanagar, known as one of the most posh residential neighborhoods in Bangalore. �But��
�But what?� Priya giggled.
�You&#8217;ve been driving so quietly for over twenty minutes.� Rahul said. �It kind of bothers me.�
�Well stop being bothered, then!� Priya said.
�Like it&#8217;s that simple.� Rahul said, scratching his chin in his hands. �Can I take a guess as to what this is all about?�
�No, don&#8217;t!�
�You&#8217;re taking me to that fancy Italian restaurant everyone&#8217;s been talking about?� Rahul asked.
�I said no guessing, Rahul.� Priya laughed.
�We&#8217;re going to that new 3D movie?�
�Noooooooo.� Priya asserted. �This is something you cannot believe even if I told you.�
�Does it have something to do with our relationship?� Rahul asked.
�That&#8217;s correct. Finally.�
�Hmmm,� Rahul paused for a heavy breath, �a jewelry store?�
�Nope.� Priya shook her head. �This is much bigger. Much, much bigger.�
�Whoa. Bigger than a jewelry store? My imagination fails me.�
�Good. Keep quiet for a few more minutes, we&#8217;re almost there.� Priya slowed down the car and stopped before one of the biggest houses in the neighborhood. She turned to Rahul and smiled.
�Oh? This is it?� Rahul asked. �We&#8217;re going in to meet your parents?�
�No, silly. I would never do that to you.� Priya laughed.
�Then whose house is this?� Rahul asked, raising his head high enough to see the dome shaped structure on top of the house, the big, beautiful reflective windows and the high quality cream and brown painted finishing that made the house stand out like a royal palace compared to the other houses.
Her eyes twinkled with magnificent brilliance and she had a calm, happy smile on her face as she gave him the answer. �This, my dear sweet Rahul,� Priya said, "is my new house!"
�Oh my God! You're joking!� Rahul said.
"Nope."
Rahul jumped out of the car to stare even more intently at the radiant palatial structure. �The Priya Mansion.� He read out the marble engraving in the facing side of the compound. �So all this is really yours?� He felt the heavy metallic gates in his hands and pushed it open. The noise they made as they opened up had a royal timbre to it.
�Yes. It&#8217;s all mine.� Priya said.
�How is that possible? Where did you get the money for something like this?�
�You wouldn&#8217;t believe if I told you.� Priya shook her head as she walked past the dazed boyfriend and rang the doorbell.
�Who&#8217;s inside the house?� Rahul asked.
�Why, my butler of course.� Priya said. Rahul&#8217;s mouth hung open as he stared at the girl. She moved her hands across his face to break him out of his spell, but he remained in his daze for a few more moments.
Rajat opened the door, dressed up in his formal attire- a brilliant white shirt, his glimmering black blazer, a red bow tie, black trousers and polished black shoes. Priya held her head high and frowned at him.
�Rajat, did you bring me the Kashmiri silk foot rugs like I&#8217;d asked?�
�I couldn&#8217;t find them anywhere. I&#8217;m so sorry, Priya.� Rajat said, getting down to the floor on one knee and hanging his head low.
�Don&#8217;t you think my beautiful feet deserve the richest silk in the land to wipe on?�
�You do, my Goddess Priya.� Rajat cried. �But unfortunately��
�In that case, my boyfriend and I will use your face as our foot mat.� Priya said, clapping her hands and pointing her forefinger to her boots.
�Most certainly, my Lady.� Rajat said. He placed his cheek on the floor and closed his eyes. The heel of Priya&#8217;s boots landed on his ears and scratched much of his face&#8217;s skin as she wiped away most of their dust on him. She did the same with her other boot.
�Go ahead. Use my foot rug.� Priya said to the still dazed Rahul.
�Well, why not?� he mumbled, stepping forward and wiping the dust off his boots on Rajat&#8217;s face. �God, look at that beautiful chandelier,� he pointed to the ceiling. �And that black leather couch. Please pinch me and tell me I&#8217;m dreaming.�
�My pleasure,� Priya said, pinching his muscular biceps.
"Aaaahh!" Rahul hissed in pain.
�And you&#8217;re not dreaming.� She stretched out her arms and turned around, dancing her way into the living room. �This is my new house.�
�It&#8217;s as beautiful a place as you deserve to be in.� Rahul nodded. �But I still don&#8217;t get what the hell is going on.�
�I will tell you, once you answer the big question.� Priya said, halting her dance.
�What question?�
�Rahul,� Priya said, stretching out her hands for a hug. �Will you move in with me?�
�Of course I will. I love you,� Rahul grabbed Priya&#8217;s body into his and raised her light body off the ground with his strong arms to kiss her on the lips. He turned her around in his arms through a full circle before letting her back onto solid ground. He gazed deep into her eyes. �Now will you tell me what&#8217;s going on?�
�Well.� Priya said. �My butler&#8217;s name is Rajat. He was my classmate in school.�
�Okay.� Rahul nodded.
�After school, he went forth and built an online dating website. He worked persistently on it for more than five years and turned it into a multimillion dollar enterprise.�
�That&#8217;s commendable.�
�Yesterday, he comes to my house and tells me about his business. Then he tells me that he was only able to pull it off because of me. The thought of me was the only thing that kept him going.� Priya said.
�You do have an inspiring effect on people.� Rahul said. �Go on.�
�He believes that since everything he&#8217;s achieved is only because of me, I should keep all his money and assets. He gave me two million dollars, plus this house and his business.�
�So we&#8217;re freakishly rich people. Bye bye middle class!� Rahul said, raising his hand for a high-five, responded swiftly by the girl. �And we do deserve all this I&#8217;d think. Technically, the business wouldn&#8217;t even exist if not for you.�
�Exactly.� Priya said. �I earned all of this.�
�Now, what does he want in return?� Rahul asked.
�Ask him. I&#8217;ve never been able to get an answer out of him.� Priya shrugged.
�Hey Rajat, what is it that you want?�
�I want nothing, sir.� Rajat said. �I wanted to make her happy. I know that I could never be a boyfriend for the likes of her. Money is all I have.�
�Well,� Rahul said, pointing his hands randomly across the house. �You have made her happy with all this.�
�Indeed, Sir Rahul.�
�Now she&#8217;s happily moved in with me.� Rahul said.
"Congratulations, Sir." Rajat said, swallowing hard.
�So you can get out now.� Rahul declared, pointing to the front door.
Rajat was aghast, his head bowed down and looked at the ground, shaking his head.
Rahul held Priya in his arms and kissed her hair. �He&#8217;ll tell us what he wants. It&#8217;s the only way I could think of,� he whispered into her ear.
�Priya said I could be her slave.� Rajat said.
�She needs an army of competent slaves around her at all times.� Rahul said. �What makes you think you&#8217;re good enough?�
�I&#8217;m willing to do anything for her.� Rajat said.
�And what about me?� Rahul asked. �Are you ready to serve me, too?�
Rajat turned to Priya for the answer. �If you want to be my slave, you&#8217;ll have to be his slave, too,� she said.
�I&#8217;m ready for anything, Master.� Rajat said, kneeling before Rahul.
�To begin with, you&#8217;re much too well dressed to be my slave.� Rahul said. �Take off all those beautiful clothes now.� Rajat took off his coat and looked around for a place to keep them. �Keep them near my feet!� Rahul specified, pointing down.
�Yes, Master.� Rajat said, placing the expensive coat at Rahul&#8217;s feet. He slowly took off his white shirt and his vest to stuff them at his master&#8217;s feet.
Priya stepped forward and stretched out her hand. �Rajat, hand me your belt.�
�Here,� Rajat unbuckled his belt and gave it to her.
�Now your pants.� Rahul grinned. Rajat stood up and obeyed his master swiftly, adding his pants to the pile of fine clothes at his feet. �Your underpants, too,� he said. Rajat obeyed unquestioningly. �Now you look less like a successful businessman and more like a slave dog.�
�Thank you, Sir.� Rajat said, joining his hands.
�I feel like having some cold chocolate milk shake.� Priya said, dropping on the couch. �Go bring me some, now.�
Rajat scampered into the kitchen and returned in a few minutes, carrying a glass of brown chocolate milk shake for Priya.
�That&#8217;s good. Now I wish to be entertained while I drink this.�
�What do you want me to do, Priya?� Rajat asked.
�Go and sit on the floor, next to the pile of your clothes.� Priya said. Rajat sat down on his knees. �Rahul, take his belt and hit him with it,� she said, giving Rahul the beautiful shiny leather belt with a buckle made of solid gold.
�My pleasure,� Rahul laughed, holding the belt and approaching Rajat.
�And stand on his clothes.� Priya said. �He forgot to bring me my Kashmiri foot rugs today and he deserves the worst punishment.�
Rajat sat still and looked down, his lips sealed tight.
Rahul stepped his weight on the expensive clothes and held the lengthy belt behind his shoulders. He brought it down on Rahul&#8217;s naked skin with full force, peeling off bits of his skin on impact.
Priya laughed as she sipped the cold milk shake. �That was beautiful! Give him some more!�
Rahul took a deep breath, prepared the belt for action and took it down to the millionaire slave. Without a moment&#8217;s pause, he raised the belt to the other side and brought it down even harder. Priya cringed at the leather to skin impact moment, then laughed in approval for her boyfriend&#8217;s merciless performance.
Rajat suffered a few dozen beatings from his master, much to Priya&#8217;s joy and amusement. �Wonderful!� Priya had a few tears in her eyes from the excessive laughter, which she wiped off with a finger. �I&#8217;m done with my milk shake, by the way.�
�You felt good about that, slave?� Rahul taunted him.
�Yes, Sir!� Rajat said, sucking back tears from his eyes.
�Worth two million dollars?�
�Very much so, my Lord!�
�Good. I&#8217;m going to tie this on your neck. Get over here, you novice slave!� Rahul ordered, holding the belt in both hands and stretching it out.
�Yes, Master!� Rajat said, sitting on his knees and offering his neck to be leashed. Rahul buckled the belt around his neck and dragged him towards the couch. He sat down and tossed back Priya&#8217;s hair, then kissed her on the lips. He grabbed her waist and laid a soft kiss on her neck. She closed her eyes and dropped into the couch.
Rahul proudly looked at her and then to Rajat. �You gave her more than two million dollars, and you still don&#8217;t get to kiss her like that. Aren&#8217;t you ashamed?�
�Indeed, master.� Rajat said, rubbing some of the belt wounds. �I am sure that Priya requires a lot more than money from a man.�
�I&#8217;m a real man unlike you, you rich, eccentric loser.� Rahul said.
�Yes, Sir.� Rajat said. �Priya deserves a strong man like yourself.�
�Now shut up and watch!� Rahul said, casting aside his pants on Rajat&#8217;s face. He pounced forth and took off Priya&#8217;s shirt, and then her bra. He dug his face into her smooth, milky breasts and rubbed his cheeks against them, grinning towards Rajat as he gratified his lust.
He had a hard, gigantic midsection by the time he was done fondling with her breasts. Rahul then picked up Priya&#8217;s toned legs and held it in his arms, bringing her butt upwards to perform his thrust. He slowly slid himself into the cave of her vagina, causing her throat to emanate muffled sounds of joy. He held her legs up tight, then moved himself back and forth repeatedly, injecting more and more of his young, fertile semen into the smooth opening.
Priya moaned louder and louder with each push for a few minutes, until all her throat could do was release a gloriously satisfied �Aaaah.� Every muscle in her body released itself into an ecstatic, relaxation. Rahul fell softly on her body and laid on her for a while, before he got up and looked at Rajat. �You watched that?�
�I did, Master!� Rajat said.
�How was I?�
�You are a God among men, Sir!�
�Exactly!� Rahul said, catching the belt around Rahul&#8217;s neck. �And you are an inferior, slave-class being."
"I am, Sir."
"Now where&#8217;s the cellar, where we keep slaves like him?� Rahul asked Priya.
Priya stirred to answer the question, her fingers pointing randomly towards the stairway. �I would usually keep him under the stairs.�
�That&#8217;s where you&#8217;re going now. Follow me!� Rahul said, dragging him towards the dungeon under the stairs.

Punishment for a bad week

Priya walked out of her first floor master bedroom, dressed in her elegant blue dress, with a majestic cream-brown fur robe covering her arms and shoulders. Her head held high, she stepped towards the stairs and began to climb down. The noise from her high-heeled leather sandals resounded all over, making her royal presence felt in every corner of The Priya Mansion, including the cellar below her stairs where Rajat lie asleep, naked and unaware.
As Priya&#8217;s steps drew closer, Rajat woke up and began to move his bound body with a haphazard randomness that stemmed from incredible fear. He looked around, realized where he was and gave up. Priya stepped towards the cellar, and stood over him, glaring at his pathetic form.
�You are so poor.� Priya said, shaking her head in disgust. She reached her feet towards his face and spooned the restraining cloth out of his mouth with her sandal.
�I am very poor, my Goddess!� Rajat said.
�Just disgusting.� Priya said. �Why should a wealthy, sovereign being like me keep a poor, naked slave such as yourself?�
�I�� Rajat mumbled, �I run the business.�
�And how much did it fetch this week?� Priya asked.
�It brought ten lakh Rupees this week, my Goddess.� Rajat said, handing her a cheque. �The money arrived, too. Here, it&#8217;s all yours.�
�Ten lakhs.� Priya said. �But last week you had produced twelve lakhs.�
�I&#8217;m sorry, Mistress.� Rajat tried to move away from her. �But the numbers are bound to fluctuate on a week to week basis.�
�Well, that isn&#8217;t fair now, is it?� Priya said.
"How so, my Goddess?"
�After all, I was the very source of inspiration that helped you get your online dating business working.�
�You are, Priya. Very much so.�
�So,� Priya explained, �if you made less money this week than the last week, it reflects badly on me, don&#8217;t you think?�
�How, Priya?�
�It would mean that I inspired you less this week than last week.� Priya said. Rajat gulped. �Seriously, how much more inspired could you be? Do you see me, slave?� Priya asked.
�I do, my Goddess Priya.�
�How beautiful do I look today?� Priya asked, stepping one foot forward and spreading her hands apart.
�Like the elegant Goddess you are, Priya.�
�I bought this beautiful dress yesterday.� Priya said, touching the glimmering blue dress across her chest. �And this beautiful, soft fur robe,� she felt the soft surface of the cloth against her cheek. �I bought them all with your money, so you could feel more inspired for your business.�
�I am sorry, my Goddess.� Rajat said, curling up his naked body to hide as much of it from her view as possible. �But it&#8217;s very hard to control how much the business produces on a weekly basis.�
�You think it&#8217;s easy to choose clothes like these?� Priya asked. �And ordering my maids to bring them over from the boutique?�
�I will work harder for you, Priya. I am so sorry that I complained.�
�Sorry you will be,� Priya said. �I have an additional task for you today. Clear out that complete area there,� she said, pointing towards the huge hallway, �and bring me a dais with two thrones.�
�Thrones?� Rajat asked.
�The fanciest, most comfortable chairs. The kind that I deserve to sit on.� Priya said, walking away. �Oh, one more thing. They should be red.�
Rajat made a few phone calls, called up his contacts and arranged for the dais and the thrones. Before evening, the hallway was occupied mostly by a large dais and two comfortable leather chairs, the latest, most comfortable ones he could find anywhere.
Priya entered the mansion with Rahul, who was dressed in an elegant black suit. The couple looked like members of Royalty, in their elegant clothes and their classy demeanour.
�Welcome home, my Prince and Princess!� Rajat said, getting down on his knees.
Priya stepped her foot forward, and Rajat promptly kissed the sandal with his lips. �And you are the Pauper,� she said.
�The Prince and the Pauper.� Rahul pointed towards himself and then Rajat. �Just like the old Mark Twain novel.�
�That&#8217;s true.� Priya said. She turned to Rajat. �From now on, your name is Pauper.�
�Pauper reporting for duty, my Prince and Princess.�
�Good� Priya said, stepping one foot forward. Rajat promptly kissed her sandal.
�Now, stand up here,� Priya said, helping the Pauper up on his feet. She then threw him towards the dais, so that his body landed over its steps. �The Pauper needs to be punished for a bad weekly performance.�
�How badly did his business do?� Rahul asked.
�Only ten lakh Rupees this week.� Priya said.
�Pathetic. How can you do this to us?� Rahul said, stepping his boots on the Pauper&#8217;s feet, then his knees, then his midsection. He trampled over much of the Pauper&#8217;s body as he climbed up to his throne.
Rahul then held out his hand, helping Priya walk all over the Pauper&#8217;s body with her sharp sandals. The couple sat down on their big chairs, while the Pauper knelt before them, bowing down and waiting for instructions.
�It seems that this slave, this Pauper, is in need of some inspiration.� Priya said. �He performed better last week than this week.�
�I know exactly what he needs.� Rahul said. �Hey Pauper, go fetch me my whip.�
�Please, Sir!� the Pauper pleaded.
�Fetch my whip, too.� Priya said. �We are going to give you all the inspiration you need for your business.�
Rajat ran off into the storage room and brought back the couple&#8217;s hard leather whips. �Here you go, my Prince. My Princess.�
�Good. Now kneel between us and kiss the foot of our chairs.�
He knelt between them and took the unforgiving leather to his body, screaming and crying in pain.
He tried to move away from the painful whipping, but Priya strangled him in place. �You don&#8217;t have the right to move away when I&#8217;m beating you up.�
�I&#8217;m sorry, Princess.�
�Fetch me some ropes.� Priya said. The Pauper brought her the ropes, which she used to bind his hands to the bottom of the two chairs.
A second rain of leather followed, with the couple sitting down on their comfortable chairs and whipping the life and blood out of him.
