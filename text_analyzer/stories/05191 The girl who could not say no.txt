Author�s note: The story explores the mindset of a submissive who has chosen to obey someone 

who controlled her, in this case a peculiar instruction for the evening. The focus is not on why she 

chose to obey him or the events that led to her decision, but on the happenings thereafter - the 

implications of her obedience, the psychological struggle she faced for the rest of the evening.



---



Grace felt that she was dreaming. Perhaps she was drowsy from the alcohol, or perhaps it was 

really a dream. 



Was it an office party to celebrate the new year ? Everyone from the company was there, 

including account executives, secretaries all the way to the department heads and directors. It 

was at somebody�s house, so large it could be almost called a mansion. The surroundings looked 

familiar to her but she couldn�t remember when she was there before.



The lights in the room were dim, and there was loud music playing and perhaps twenty to thirty 

people in the same room as herself, talking, drinking in groups, some standing, some sitting. She 

sipped from the cocktail glass in her hand. She had finished the cocktail, and only the cherry was 

left. She had to get more to drink. Stumbling towards the bar, she passed a mirror on the wall, 

and caught a glance of her own reflection.



She was wearing a slinky halter cut-out mini dress. Could it be even called a dress? A single 

rhinestone brooch was set on the dress below her navel. Above the brooch, she was practically 

naked for there was a large cut-out baring the center of her body starting from immediately 

above the brooch, all the way up to her neck. With the center of the dress missing, only the outer 

halves of her breasts were covered. The rhinestone brooch itself was set on the top edge of the 

skirt portion of the dress, drawing the eye to notice how amazingly low-rise the skirt was. The 

skirt was hanging so low on her hips that any lower it would slide off her bum. The distance 

from her bared belly-button to the brooch set on the top-edge of the skirt was like the span of her 

hand from her wrist to her fingertips. On her wrist was a stunning rhinestone bracelet that 

matched the brooch.



While the bottom half of the dress was practically the entire dress in terms of the amount of 

material, it was by no means a long dress. It was very short � a good eight inches above her 

knees, not even covering up to the middle of her thighs. Waist-up, the halter left her back free, 

exposing her shoulder blades, definitely her usual choice of style for party-wear. But in this case 

the strap around the back of her neck merged seamlessly to the two front pieces of her dress half-

covering her breasts, tapering downwards to join the skirt part of the dress, baring a lot more 

than the usual halterback bare-shoulder dress or tubetop. 



Grace was stunned to see what she was wearing in the mirror. Yet paradoxically, she wasn�t 

surprised. It must have been Royston�s orders. He had been making her dress slutty to the office.



Royston did like her once upon a time. How did it come to be? She rejected him. Perhaps he still 

liked her. But now their relationship was different. He controlled her. Perhaps he got off on 

seeing her titillating the guys in the office with what she wore. If he couldn�t control her heart, he 

controlled her body. Grace felt a little whoozy, thinking about this.&nbsp;&nbsp; 



She was quite sure there were several guys from the accounting department who were staring at 

her as she walked past a table, but she ignored them. She had to get another drink.



�Hi Grace, how are you doing?� 



It was Jim from the sales department. Jim was a smooth-talker, with smooth well-gelled hair. She 

wasn�t sure she really liked him. She did not know him too well, except a few interactions and 

meetings at work. But he was always polite. There was no reason for her to be rude. She smiled at 

him, and replied, �I am fine Jim, on my way to the bar. And you?�



�Fantastic. My my.. the famous Grace getting a drink for herself? That can�t be so. Allow me to, 

well � escort you to the bar,� said Jim, eyeing Grace�s tipsy walk. �It looks like you can do with 

some help.� Jim put his arm around her waist to steady her. 



Grace smiled, and wanted to say something along the lines that she could manage, but couldn�t. 

She wasn�t supposed to refuse. 



Jim walked Grace toward the bar, putting his arm around her shoulder. 



�Thank you,� said Grace feeling a little high. How many drinks did she have, she asked herself. 

Can�t remember.



Stumbling a little, she felt Jim�s hands sliding down her shoulders to her elbow. �Sorry, � said 

Grace feeling embarrassed that she was leaning onto him. Her sense of balance was a little off. As 

she walked, she was barely aware that his hand was no longer on her elbow, but had moved to 

her back and then to the side of her chest. 



Nearing the bar, Grace saw a familiar figure sitting there � it was the burly man with the bearded 

face from the shopping mall. The guy that burst into the men�s toilet while Nakamori and Joe 

were taking nude photographs of her in there ! Grace felt the panic rise in her heart � what was 

he doing here?!



�Stop, Jim.. stop I�m feeling giddy,� lied Grace, hiding her face in Jim�s chest to avoid that man 

noticing her. 



�Oh, are you alright?� said Jim, hugging her even closer to his body. He was enjoying the 

experience of Grace clinging onto him. Did she let him? Did she encourage him? She would be 

practically lying on his chest if they were in a horizontal position rather than standing. Jim knew 

she was tipsy, and was the type who would take advantage of a tipsy woman. Doesn�t matter 

whether she knew it or not. Didn�t care. They say alcohol reduced inhibitions. If the woman let 

him do it, he would.



�Why don�t you take a seat over there with George and the rest, I�ll get a drink for you,� said Jim, 

rubbing her bare shoulders.



Jim brought her to a table where four other guys were lounging on settees around it. 



�Hey guys,� said Jim, �Grace�s joining us.�



�Oh sure, that�s great. Hi Grace, happy new year !� said George, extending his arms to give her a 

hug and a kiss. George was a genuinely nice guy, even slightly shy. Not her type, Grace thought. 

But he had the hots for her. She knew it, from the looks of people whenever she visited the 

accounting department to look for him. 



Not wanting to be impolite, Grace hugged George, and they exchanged kisses on the cheek. 



�Happy New Year, Grace� said John, standing up. Grace let him hug her too, feeling both his 

hands on her naked back. 



She suddenly felt self-conscious again about the mini-dress she was wearing, and how the guys 

around her were staring at her. 



After all, the material that joined the top of her dress from waist up to the bottom of the dress 

was only two fingers wide, due to two daring cut-outs on each side of the mini-dress that bared 

the sides of her body from her ribcage down to her hips. If for any reason the two narrow 

stretches of the garment joining the top of the dress to the bottom were severed, there would be 

nothing holding the bottom part of the dress up � it would fall off her bum, leaving her naked 

below, and also leaving her topless.&nbsp; She would be utterly humiliated. With a shiver, Grace 

recalled for a split second this very emotion she felt when she was made to strip nude in the 

shopping mall toilet. 



John gave her a more than light peck on her cheek; it was more like a lingering smooch.



�And from me too, Grace,� said Ryan who literally pulled Grace into a tight embrace, one arm 

trapping her waist to his hips, while the other hand was on her ass. �Bear hug!� he joked, to the 

laughter of the guys. He was holding her so tight that her breasts were mashed against his chest. 

Pulling the petite girl up, the other guys around could see her already short skirt hike up from 

the back, flashing her thong covered ass. T-back thong to be exact.



�You can sit beside me Grace,� said Ryan, pulling the girl down to the seat next to him. Grace 

could not say no, and found herself squashed next to the man who obviously did not mind, 

putting his hand on her thigh.&nbsp; 



Jim returned shortly with a drink for her. Grace found herself toasting with the guys. She could 

not say no when they said �bottom�s up�. Just as she finished her drink and was putting down her 

glass on the table, Grace crossed her leg. 



While the men might had thought her eyes were still on the glass and that she wouldn�t notice 

where they were gazing , she knew they were all looking at her legs when she was crossing them. 



Grace felt a pang of horniness � if one of the guys had said, �Grace would you like to spread your 

thighs wide?� Grace would not be able to refuse him. She would have to part her legs while she 

sat there on the low sofa in front of them. 



Those were Royston�s instructions for her that evening. Grace would not be allowed to say no. 

She had to accede to every request that was put to her by anyone for that evening till 8am the 

next day.&nbsp; 



Royston caught her stealing from the company, and threatened to report her. She did not want to 

go to jail. She had to obey him now. At what price? 



-- 



�Would you like another drink?� Jim asked, looking closely at Grace�s face. Her skin was slightly 

flushed and her eyes were finding it hard to focus. 



Grace shook her head, but her mouth opened and said, �Yes please��



And so Grace had to down another drink. She was feeling buzzed for sure now.



Grace found herself being pulled by Jim to another part of the room, to find more people to toast 

to. Many folks were getting rowdier now, and drunk. They had to push their way through a few 

groups of people. Grace smiled docilely as she was led by Jim through the crowd. She did see 

familiar faces, and said, �hi� when they smiled at her, but she did not recognize many faces too. 

Friends of her co-workers perhaps. 



Some people said, �Nice dress, Grace!�, stopping to hug her as if they were old friends. Some 

whom she did not recognize said, �Hey, sexy!� She was mildly aware of people brushing against 

her, and touching her as they moved through the crowd to get to the other side of the room.



The music changed and became louder. �Looks like the deejay had started the disco!� said Jim to 

the inebriated Grace. �Shall we dance, sexy?� said Jim.



Grace said yes, and found herself on the dance floor with Jim, grooving to the beat with tens of 

other half drunk guys and gals. The dance floor got more crowded as she danced with Jim. With 

his arms around her waist, his groin was grinding against Grace�s. As Grace had her arms around 

his neck, she thought she heard Jim whisper into her ear, �Can I take off your thongs?� But it was 

just her imagination. The alcohol was making her head spin. The music pounded in her ears and 

the lights were bright to her eyes. Grace shut here eyes and imagined what it would feel like if 

someone from behind yanked down her thongs to her feet. 



Instead she just felt Jim feeling her up. His hands were roaming her body as they danced, 

touching her ass, her back, her thighs.



Was Jim one of them ? Royston said he would check on her tonight. Make sure she was not 

refusing any requests put to her. He might plant some people to ask her questions, just to make 

sure she always answered �yes�. Could Jim be testing her ? 



She can�t be sure, but she knew the costs of disobeying Royston would be high. Too high. She 

wouldn�t want to risk it. Not after what she had been through. She had to stick with it. 



A few other guys asked to dance with Grace, and she could not refuse. Invariably, while dancing 

with her, they took the opportunity to hug her, kiss her, touch her body and feel her up. 



Grace looked at the mass of faces in the dancing crowd, at the observers in the sidelines. She did 

not see Royston. Would he know? He could have someone spy on her and report to him. He did 

that before. She had no choice. She let the guys rotate amongst themselves on who would dance 

with her.



Jim enjoyed the envious look on the guys� faces when they asked him if he minded, to which he 

said, �No, be my guest.� Once he had seen them get hot and heavy with Grace, he would take 

over again. 



She had no choice, letting them feel her up, as they rubbed their bodies and groins against her. 

Hands on her ass and bare back. She even felt Ryan�s erection when he slow danced with her. He 

was hard, and pressing against her. He didn�t seem to mind that she might notice.



She felt humiliated that there were eyes in the crowd on her. Accusing eyes. Eyes that judged her 

and assumed how sexually promiscuous she was. A slut who let the men touch her body. A 

cockteaser. Some of these people work in the same office as her. How was she going to face them 

when it came to Monday?



�Jim, I think I�m drunk, I can�t dance anymore,� said Grace, her face flushed.



�Drunk? Would you like me to send you home?� said Jim.



�That�s not�� Grace started to say, but bit her lip, and completed her sentence, �.. such a bad 

idea.�



--



�Here you are,� said Jim, stopping his car on the road in front of the hotel. �Why are you staying 

in a hotel?�



�My place is being renovated,� Grace lied.



�Are you feeling better then?� he said, turning to face her, and leaning closer. �Do you want me 

to send you upstairs?�



�I am better, thanks,� said Grace, hoping he would just leave.



�I think I�d better come up with you,� said Jim, parking his car.



Grace stayed silent. She could not say no. She was still feeling light headed.



The bellboy and staff in the reception saw her in that sexy dress, drunk and leaning against a man 

who was escorting her upstairs to her room. Through the closed circuit security camera in the 

elevator, they would later also see the couple kissing.



In the elevator, Jim was leaning close to Grace. He told her, �You look so sexy tonight Grace,� 

staring into her eyes. Grace tried to look away but couldn�t. �May I kiss you?�



Not waiting for her answer, he kissed her on the lips. Grace put up very little resistance. 



Jim pulled his head back slightly, looking into her eyes, and said, �Just a goodnight kiss.� 



There was another pregnant pause. Grace wasn�t sure what she was doing but she was silent. 

Then he pressed his mouth against hers again, kissing her more passionately this time. 



Grace�s mind said, �No, no no,� but her lips were submissive, allowing the man to taste them as 

he pleased.



The elevator bleeped, announcing the arrival of the eleventh floor. Jim stopped kissing her, and 

Grace quickly walked out of the elevator, with him following behind.



Despite being tipsy, Grace managed to find her room and unlocked the door. Pushing the door 

open she turned around to face Jim, saying, �Thanks for sending me home Jim, good night.�



�May I come in?� said Jim, his hand on the door.



Grace felt a sharp pang of guilt, humiliation and horniness simultaneously pierce her heart.



Once again, she had to betray herself. �Yes,� she said, biting her lip, as Jim stepped through the 

doorway. The door to her hotel room closed, with the two of them alone inside.



�Can I kiss you again?� was Jim�s next question that would lead to him removing her clothes and 

his own. 



�Can I taste you below?� would lead to him eating her pussy first, and imminently having her 

return the favor later. She would not be able to help herself from juicing as he ate her out for a 

few minutes. 



He would get up and show her how proudly his erection was standing. He wanted to see the 

look in her eyes, as she attempted not to look, but could not resist glancing at his fully hard 

manhood. Positioning himself in 69 with her on the hotel bed, he would continue tonguing the 

sexy wench�s hot little cunt, reveling in her girlish whimpers. 



She would not have a choice to say no when he finally told her to �Lick my cock, Grace. Hold me 

in your hand.. you make me so hard. You make me hard, even back in the office.� This she would 

do while he continued licked her in the 69 position, and his cock was poised inches from her face. 

This would culminate in �Omigod, your tongue is so hot Grace, suck me Grace� ohhh yes, your 

mouth is so wet and hot. I�m so hard right now.�



Grace did as she was told, for if Jim had asked her, �Grace, would you like to suck my cock?�, 

she would have replied �Yes please� even if she didn�t want to. If he had asked �Grace, do you 

like sucking cocks?�, she had to say �Yes, I do,� too. 



Finally the humiliating question came. �Do you like the taste of my cock, Grace?� he said, while 

his cock was inside her mouth. �Mmm� she mumbled, before she withdrew her mouth from the 

throbbing erection. �Yes,� she replied, her voice trembling as a tear came to the corner of her eye 

as she laid there on the bed next to his crotch. �You like the feel of my hard cock throbbing in 

your mouth, don�t you?� he said, flicking his tongue over her clit, causing little bolts of electricity 

to run through pelvic region and her spine. �Yes,� replied Grace, humiliated. 



�Oh yes�.Your mouth is made for cock-sucking, Grace,� he said, closing his eyes. 



Grace did not answer. She knew that after they have had oral sex, he would fuck her in the pussy.



She would lay there quietly, letting him fuck her in missionary, his face above hers as her body 

jerked with each thrust of his.



�Are you on the pill, Grace?� he asked, in between thrusts.



Grace nodded, tearing in the corner of her eyes. He would not see her crying, as the lights were 

dimmed out.



�Uggh, ugggh, uggh..� Jim made guttural sounds with each thrust into her pussy, thinking of 

how incredibly tight Grace�s pussy was. He couldn�t wait to tell the other guys in the office of his 

newest sexual conquest, of how he bedded the sexy young thing Grace.



The pace of his fucking increased, his body slamming into Grace�s petite body harder and faster. 

�Can I cum in you?� Jim asked finally, grimacing with the effort of trying to hold back his climax.



Grace would nod again, her voice breaking, �Yes Jim, please cum in me.�&nbsp; She screwed her eyes 

shut, feeling her own words tear herself apart inside her. The slut in her craved the feeling of 

sperm splashing in her womb. 



Her reply excited the man fucking her, for he was expecting her to ask him to cum outside of her, 

perhaps on her body. Jim could not believe what Grace said. Indeed, even as she said it, he could 

feel her body tightening, her back lifting slightly off the bed, her cunt becoming even wetter as if 

she was on the verge of orgasm.



�Fuck, I�m gonna cum in you Grace� I�m going to cum in your hot, wet pussy� oh oh oh oh 

FUCK�. I can feel OHHH your pussy spasming UHHGG - milking my hard cock�. I � AM � 

CUMMMINNNNGGG��.Nnnnngghhhhhhhhhh�. His body jerked and jerked, shooting sperm 

into her pussy.



**



Grace awoke. She was in her hotel room bed, but she was alone. Her body and her sheets were 

soaked. It was not just perspiration, for she could feel her vagina wet with secretions. 



Was it a dream? The party and what happened with Jim after the party? Her head still felt 

groggy. Groping around, she could not find her panties.
