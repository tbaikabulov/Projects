&nbsp;

Nicole stepped out of the shower and
dried herself before pulling off the cap that covered her long strawberry-blond
hair.� It had been a tiring day and all
she wanted to do was climb into bed and sleep.� She sighed, picked up a hair brush and
decided it was better to get the tangles out now.� Standing naked before the mirror at the sink,
Nicole looked at herself and tried to see what men saw in her.� Tall, she often felt like a giant towering
over both women and men.

&nbsp;

�You�re not too tall,� proclaimed a
deep voice. ��You�re just right for me.�

&nbsp;

Before Nicole could move, she found
her wrists held behind her and a hand over her mouth.

&nbsp;

�You should see what I see.� Very pretty blue eyes, a cute nose with a
round tip that should be tapped when your naughty, a perfect mouth�shall I
continue?�

&nbsp;

Nicole nodded.� He could speak to her all day and she�d want
to get lost in his voice.� It was
musical, hypnotic, arrogant and playful.�
She found herself wanting to see his face.

&nbsp;

�No interrupting then.�� 

&nbsp;

The hand covering her mouth lowered
and spanned her throat.� Nicole found the
gesture both protective and sexy.� He
pulled her closer and she realized he was naked.� His skin pressed to her skin.� She felt herself becoming aroused.� When he rubbed his chin lightly across her
shoulder, she knew he was slightly taller than her.� Who was this stranger?� The whiskers on his face, tickled and she
squirmed into him.� He chuckled and put
his lips to her ear.

&nbsp;

�As I was saying, a perfect mouth
with luscious lips.� Your body is slim
and toned, yet you have these beautiful breasts that need to be held and
kissed.� So many things I could do to
them and make you beg me for more.� Now
look in the mirror and see yourself.� Do
you see these curls?� They hide the
treasure that makes you so very feminine.�

&nbsp;

His hand skimmed her skin, lightly
caressing a breast before moving down her taut stomach and petting the soft triangle
of hair above her sex.� Stopping all too
soon for Nicole, his hand moved to hold her hip.� She gasped.�
His hand was cool, like the hand of her vampire master before he�d fed.� She hadn�t noticed that before. �She also hadn�t noticed the way his body
vibrated with psychic energy.� She
noticed both now.� Perhaps he was like
her master.� 

&nbsp;

Neither afraid nor alarmed, she
sensed no danger from the intruder.�
Turning her head, Nicole tried to see him in the mirror and he nuzzled
her neck.� All she could see was his dark
hair.� Lips brushing her throat, he
whispered and sent shivers down her body.

&nbsp;

�You see, slave?� You�re beautiful.� I�m going to make you mine.�

&nbsp;

�I�m not a slave,� she protested.

&nbsp;

He nibbled her earlobe and the hand
on her hip pressed, grinding his erection into the cheeks of her ass.� Nicole felt weak in the knees.� Her admirer was overpowering her with his
touch and scent.� He smelled of leather
and horses, a spicy cologne and of something wild and
untamed like a jungle cat. 

&nbsp;

�Over here, little one.� To your bed where you
belong.�

&nbsp;

He guided her across the room.� Nicole soon found herself on her back, her
head on a pillow.� His strong left hand
held Nicole�s arms over her head and her captor smiled when she tried to
struggle.� Her feet became caught in the
sheets and he used that to his advantage, placing his knee between her
legs.� Nicole became very aware of his
intentions and renewed her struggles.� It
was wrong for him to touch her like this.�
She should have stopped him before, but she didn�t want to.� He shook his head in disapproval.

&nbsp;

�Stop fighting your master.� Have you no manners?�

&nbsp;

�Get away from me.� You are not my master!�

&nbsp;

�That�s enough, slave.� Not another word from you in that tone of
voice.�

&nbsp;

Nicole felt the intruder reaching
into her mind, taking over her will and then a sense of calm when he released
her psyche.� Why was she fighting
him?� She couldn�t remember.� Gazing into his green eyes, she found him
quite handsome. Was it an illusion or was he still in her mind?

&nbsp;

�Tell me what you see, slave.� As if you were speaking to your best friend
and I wasn�t here with you.� Do you like
what you see and feel?�

&nbsp;

She nodded with no sense of
embarrassment at his request.� Nicole
knew what she would say to Catherine and she pictured her friend sitting next
to her.

&nbsp;

�Cat, I met the most amazing
man.� He�s got curly black hair that
makes me want to run my fingers through it.�
It�s long enough for a pony tail, or a braid.� His eyes are like emeralds and when he looks
at me, he takes my breath away.�

&nbsp;

�Tell me more.�� 

&nbsp;

His husky voice sent chills through
her body. �Nicole felt herself getting
wet.� Surely he�d notice.� Before she could think about the
ramifications of her own lust, he tickled her with his free hand.

&nbsp;

�What else?� he asked, further
encouraging her to play his game.� She grinned for a moment before speaking.

&nbsp;

�He�s rugged, with a strong nose and
a full mouth and his whiskers tickle when he brushes them against my neck.� Where Uncle Stephen reminds me of a little
boy, he reminds me of a rough cowboy or a knight in shining armor and I ��

&nbsp;

Her face turned a delightful shade
of crimson.� 

&nbsp;

�You what?� he asked not so
innocently.

&nbsp;

�I want to kiss his thick lips.� I think I�ve dreamt about kissing him.�

&nbsp;

�And his body?� Do you like his body?�

&nbsp;

Nicole nodded and blushed.� This big giant of a man, who claimed to be
her master, actually wanted to know what she thought.� What could she tell Catherine?� She studied her naked captor like she would a
work of art.� He appeared to be no more
than thirty, perhaps in his mid-twenties.�
He had white skin, not too pale, more like a faded tan and his broad
shoulders tapered to a narrow waist.� His
hairless upper body was well formed and muscular, like statues of the ancient
Greeks, and not a modern day bodybuilder with exaggerated muscles.� When Nicole lowered her eyes, she could see
his thick shaft standing at attention.�
It jutted out from a nest of dark curls and she wanted to touch him, to
see what he felt like.� She smiled and
thought of Goldilocks and the three bears.�
His cock was not too big, not too small, but just right.

&nbsp;

�Please stand up and turn around.�

&nbsp;

He laughed at her request.� Deep, full, and carefree, his laugh enchanted
Nicole.

&nbsp;

�Trying to get away from me?�

&nbsp;

�I wanted to see your butt.� So far you�re a ten in my book and amazingly
perfect.� I don�t think, I could tell
that to Cat, cause she�d be very jealous.� And if not, she�d want to know who you are
and I don�t think I want to share you.�
But then, I don�t even know your name.�

&nbsp;

�My name is Michael, but you may
call me Master.�

&nbsp;

He lowered his mouth and kissed
Nicole.� She could feel the energy
between them.� The ultimate chemistry
that her Aunt Danielle tried to describe that she felt between her and her
lifemate, Stephen.� And it felt really,
really good.� Michael claimed her,
branding her as his and she wanted him.�
With fire and passion, Nicole returned the kiss and tried to signal that
she wanted more.

&nbsp;

His free hand cupped a breast and he
kissed her cheek, her neck, pausing to lick and tease.� The hand on her breast massaged gently.� His talented fingers tweaked a nipple.� She moaned and he circled the tip until it
hardened, signaling her readiness.� He
lowered his lips and suckled her breast. �His mouth, his fingers, his touch, all of him,
fed her arousal like never before.� She
watched him tasting her.� He raised his
green eyes.� She thought Michael�s
possessive look and his mouth on her breast were the most erotic things she had
ever seen.� She felt like a firestorm flowed
through her veins.� 

&nbsp;

�Please�Michael�let me touch you.� 

&nbsp;

She wiggled under him, spreading her
legs and blatantly offering herself to this total stranger.

&nbsp;

�Try again, slave.�

&nbsp;

�Stop calling me that.� I am not
a slave,� she hissed.� �Get off me, if
you can�t treat me with respect.�

&nbsp;

�Little one, so young and na�ve, of
course you�re my slave.� Call me Master
or you�ll earn your first spanking.�

&nbsp;

�No!�

&nbsp;

�I warned you.�

&nbsp;

Michael easily flipped her over and
laid her across his lap.� Wriggling and
squirming, Nicole felt his erection poking into her stomach and she couldn�t
get away.� She wasn�t sure she wanted
to.� Her hands were in front of her, held
in his left hand, and she was very aware of her nakedness.� Very aware of her skin
touching his.� He put his right
hand on the small of her back and pressed.�


&nbsp;

�That feels nice, slave, but you�d
best stay still for this.�

&nbsp;

�Let me go!�

&nbsp;

�That�s please let me go, Master,�
he corrected with a hint of laughter in his voice and she tried again.� He was only playing, wasn�t he?

&nbsp;

�Master Michael, please let me go.�

&nbsp;

�And you�ll be a good slave.�

&nbsp;

�Dammit!� I am not
your slave!� I�d be happy to be your pet,
but I�m nobody�s slave.�

&nbsp;

�It�s all semantics, little
one.� In time, you�ll understand that
it�s not the words, but what they mean.�

&nbsp;

She shook her head, trying to get
him to understand, to see that this was wrong.

&nbsp;

�No, it�s more than that.� You can�t just come in my bedroom and declare
that I�m your slave, like I�m a piece of furniture with no value.� I won�t be your play toy!�

&nbsp;

�That�s enough, slave.� I know your thoughts, but you don�t understand your own value.�

&nbsp;

�Grrr!�� She growled to emphasize her anger.� �Let go of me!�

&nbsp;

�I think not.�

&nbsp;

His hand came down hard on her right
cheek and Nicole yelped into the bedding.�
Another blow to her left cheek and she pressed her lips tightly
together.� She wasn�t going to give him
the satisfaction of hearing her cry out.�
Right cheek, left cheek, back and forth, his open hand spanked her
bottom over and over again in different spots.�
It seemed he would never end.� Nicole
found herself panting from the hits. The pain turned into something else.� It turned into something that frightened
her.� She shouldn�t like this, should
she?

&nbsp;

Michael lightened the blows.� Nicole�s head buzzed.� Aware of his movements, of her own body
reaching for sexual release, she struggled to stay in the moment.� She felt high as if she floated and yet her
groin was tingling, spreading warmth through her core.� She whimpered in frustration.� If he didn�t stop, he was going to make her
come like this.� It would be embarrassing
for him to know what affect his actions had produced.� 

&nbsp;

Just when Nicole thought she
couldn�t take it anymore, that the next blow would set off a climax, he
stopped.� Sighing, she went limp.� She felt his hand caressing her hot and swollen
bottom, then moving lower.� He gently tapped
her inner thigh.� Nicole parted her legs
and heard the sharp intake of his breath.

&nbsp;

�Little one, you smell
delicious.� This was supposed to be a
punishment.�

&nbsp;

Now she was embarrassed.� What could she say to defend herself?� Nothing.

&nbsp;

�Confused, slave?� Not everybody enjoys playing rough.� It�s a gift and I�ll cherish you more for
it.�

&nbsp;

His hand spread the wetness on her
thigh.� The pads of his fingers moved a
little higher and brushed across her tender lips.� Nicole stayed absolutely still, her mind and
body fighting an inner battle. �She
should try to stop him, but she wanted him to keep touching her.

&nbsp;

Very lightly, Michael stroked the
wet lips of her sex and then brought his fingers to his mouth.� Nicole turned her head to watch him, waiting
to see what he would do.� Michael sniffed
his fingers.� Watching her, watching him,
he licked them as if tasting a fine dessert.

&nbsp;

�Mmm, sweet like honey.� Have you ever tasted yourself?�

&nbsp;

She shook her head.� He lowered his hand, dipping into her wetness
again.� Nicole couldn�t stop herself from
moaning as he stroked her clit.� He
gently rubbed the little bud in small circles and increased the pressure when
she arched away from his hand.

&nbsp;

�Don�t fight it, my pleasure
slave.� I want you to come for me.�

&nbsp;

�Not a � pleasure slave,� she denied
in a whisper as if reminding herself.�
�I�m a � virgin.�

&nbsp;

Michael found just the right spot
and pressed.� Nicole whimpered.� He�d just spanked her and she craved his
touch as if this was perfectly normal.

&nbsp;

�Please�� 

&nbsp;

She paused in confusion, undecided
if she was asking him to stop or continue.

&nbsp;

�Hush, let it wash over you.� Give me your pleasure so I can taste it.�

&nbsp;

There was a hint of compulsion to
his magical voice, yet still Nicole didn�t sense any danger.� His hand fondled her and she stopped wanting
to think.� 

&nbsp;

�That�s it, little one.� Feel me touching you.� Give yourself to me.�

&nbsp;

The familiar sensation built in her
core, just like when her vampire master fed from her.� Nicole might be a virgin, but she wasn�t an
innocent when it came to feeding her emotions to a demon.� Her master wasn�t satisfied unless she
climaxed for him when he fed.� And now
Michael, with his cool hands, was doing the same thing to her and she wanted to
do his bidding.� 

&nbsp;

His hand pressed a little harder.� Shattering, calling out his name, she saw
lights and rainbows.� Before she could
recover, Michael laid her on her back and nudged her knees open.� Nicole stared into his eyes.� Once green, they had turned golden and were
glowing.� His fangs had descended and she
knew he was hungry, yet she had no fear.�
She thought him more attractive than before.

&nbsp;

Once again, Michael captured her
hands and moved them over her head.�
Nicole didn�t fight him.� A
bemused look crossed her face.� She
wondered why he felt it necessary to restrain her.� 

&nbsp;

�Little one, you are mine.�

&nbsp;

�With a hand on her cheek, he used the words of
her family and claimed her.� If she
acknowledged the claim, she would betray her master.� She knew what he wanted.� He wanted her to acknowledge the claim, to
willingly place herself under his protection.�
She couldn�t do it.� She belonged
to someone else.� Tears welled up in her
eyes. Nicole wanted him, but Michael was forbidden.� She shook her head and he kissed her, his
lips coaxing her to say what she couldn�t.�
When he looked at her, she felt his vulnerability and anguish that she
would deny him.

&nbsp;

�I belong to Master
Nikolai,� she whispered.� �Please
understand it�s not right.� Only my
master can give me to you.� You have to
ask or challenge him.�

&nbsp;

He nodded and she saw
the relief on his face. 

&nbsp;

�Then I will make it
right.� We were meant for one
another.� Do you want me?�

&nbsp;

Nicole nodded and he
thrust into her and held still.� She
gasped.� Instead of the pain she expected
there was only pleasure.� She�d never
wanted anything or anyone more than this.�
Leaning forward, Nicole kissed Michael and felt the rightness of
him.� She belonged with him and wanted
him with every fiber of her being.� Her
legs wrapped around him and she tried to force him in deeper.

&nbsp;

�Slow
down, little one.� I�m trying not
to hurt you.�

&nbsp;

�Please Michael � I
need you.� I�m burning up.�

&nbsp;

�As you wish,� he
responded through clenched teethe.� �Tell
me if I hurt you and I�ll stop.� 

&nbsp;

Michael shifted his
body and using strokes that were long and sure, he brought Nicole to the brink
of another orgasm.� She pressed herself
into him, meeting him as best as she could with her hands over her head and
Michael thrust a little harder.� Nicole
called out his name and shattered on his hard shaft.� He didn�t slow down.

&nbsp;

�That�s it, little
one.� Give me another one.� Come with me.�

&nbsp;

His thumb rubbed her
clit in small circles and he gave her no time to calm down from her sexual and
psychic high. �Around and around, his
thumb circled.� His cock pumped in and
out of her in a matching rhythm.� He
gently nipped her shoulder and Nicole had her first full body orgasm.� He climaxed right along with her.� The sensations went from the tips of her toes
to the top of her head.� The aftershocks
were as pleasant as the foreplay.� For a
moment, only the sound of their panting filled the room.� 

&nbsp;

�Please � I want,�
Nicole began.

&nbsp;

�Shhh, I know.�

&nbsp;

Releasing her arms,
he raised himself, but left his shaft inside of her.� Nicole lowered her hands and reached into his
soft hair.� Yes, that�s what she wanted.� She wanted to touch him.

&nbsp;

Nicole caressed his
face, his firm shoulders and finally ran her hands down his muscular
chest.� Every touch brought a new
sensation, a new jolt of pleasure between them and his eyes never left hers.� Michael was devouring her with his eyes and
she smiled.

&nbsp;

�May I please kiss
you again?�

&nbsp;

Nodding, Michael
lowered his head and shifted his weight to trap her hands between their
chests.� Nicole felt his cock stirring
with her.� It was hard and
demanding.� It seemed his recovery time
was zero, like many of the vampires in her master�s family.� Not that she should know that little fact, or
that she should be thinking it, but she finally realized why she recognized his
smell.� He smelled like her master.� 

&nbsp;

�Are you thinking
about me, pet?�

&nbsp;

�Oh, yes!�

&nbsp;

�Good.�

&nbsp;

His lips lightly
brushed across hers and the electricity raced through her, setting off another
wildfire.� He parted her lips with his
tongue and she opened her mouth.� His
tongue swept inside.� She squeezed her
legs around him.� Michael�s taste and
smell engulfed her and she playfully sucked on his tongue.� That set off a moan and she liked his
reaction. �As their tongues danced,
imitating the act of love they had just consummated, her fingernails dug
lightly into his chest.� Abruptly,
Michael raised his head and roared.� The
sound echoed through her bedroom.� 

&nbsp;

�Is my tiger upset or
happy?� she asked with a mischievous smile on her face.

&nbsp;

�Happy,� he murmured
and sniffed her hair and neck.� �You
smell like strawberries and cream and of the forest.� You must be a nymph.�

&nbsp;

�Do you like my
smell?�

&nbsp;

�Yes.�

&nbsp;

Michael nipped her
shoulder and Nicole lay passively beneath him.�
He roared again, louder this time and she raised her head to kiss his
lips and quiet the beast that she had awakened.�
A purring sound came from deep and low in his chest.� It was a loud rumbling that filled her ears
and made her want to join him.� His hands
tightened on her shoulders and he kissed her roughly.� Instead of pulling away, she pressed herself
into him and returned his passion with her own.�
She could kiss him forever.�
Slowly, he raised his head and caressed her cheek.

&nbsp;

�You should be afraid
of me.�

&nbsp;

�Is that what you
want?�

&nbsp;

There was a moment of
silence and she held her breath, waiting.�
She knew that many vampires fed on fear and enjoyed the taste as more
than any other emotion.

&nbsp;

�No, I don�t,&quot;
he admitted quietly.

&nbsp;

A sigh of relief and
her blue eyes studied his green ones.� He
was open, vulnerable, filled with lust, desire and something she couldn't
name.� Something wild in him called to
her.� She craved him.� It was too much to hope that he felt the same
way.� When she smiled, it made his body
harder.� Boldly, she leaned forward to
sniff his masculine scent.� He tightened
the grip on her shoulders. �It hurt, but
she didn't struggle.� Was she to be his
prey or not?� The decision was his to
make.� She couldn't escape if she wanted
to and she wouldn't call out for help.�
It was too late for either of them.

&nbsp;

�If you don't want me
to be afraid of you�&quot; she paused.� 

&nbsp;

He said nothing,
watching her intently.� 

&nbsp;

&quot;�then� what do
you want?�

&nbsp;

�You,
little one.� I want you.� Love me.�
Live with me.� Be my pet.�

&nbsp;

&quot;Yes,
please.&quot;� The happiness was spilling
out of her.� &quot;Can you love me,
too?&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;How could I not
love you?&quot;

&nbsp;

He moved then, slowly
rocking his hips, and Nicole shuddered from the pleasure.� As if he was her master, she turned her head
and offered Michael her throat.� His hips
moved just a little faster and his fingers dug into her shoulders.� It was a combination of pleasure and pain
that confused Nicole and she didn�t know if she wanted him to loosen his
grip.� It felt so right to be held by
him, to feel his warm breath on her neck.�
Deciding for her, Michael moved his hands to bunch her hair and nuzzled her
neck.

&nbsp;

�Little one, you have
to tell me when I hurt you.� You�re human
and you�ll have bruises in the morning.�

&nbsp;

Though he tried to
chastise her, but she couldn�t hear his words, only his husky voice.

&nbsp;

�My slave, my little
one, so innocent and sweet, I have to taste you now.� I have to claim you.�� 

&nbsp;

He licked her neck, his words
registered somewhere in her mind, and she felt his fangs lightly skimming back
and forth.� His cock pumped to the same
rhythm of his teasing and she ground herself into him.� Nicole opened her eyes and saw the shadow at
the far end of the room.� Her heart beat
wildly.� She had sensed the danger far
too late.� 

&nbsp;

�Please, Michael, stop!� It�s not allowed.� He�ll kill you.�

&nbsp;

Terrified for her captor, Nicole panicked.� Her fear replaced all sense of enjoyment, yet
she didn�t fear for herself.� She�d seen
Nikolai tear vampires apart when his property or family was attacked.� Michael was signing a death warrant for
attempting to stake his claim without a proper challenge.� 

&nbsp;

�Please, Master, don�t hurt him!� It was my fault!�

&nbsp;

Nikolai grabbed Michael by throat
and pulled him away from her.� Though
Michael was the larger of the two, the ancient Nikolai had age and power on his
side.� Nikolai�s anger covered
Nicole.� She screamed her throat raw
before everything went black.� 

&nbsp;

---

&nbsp;

Her screams jolted Michael from his
deep sleep.� He sat quickly, ready for a
fight.� The bedchamber was empty, the magical
wards he used for protection were secure and in place.� Michael laid down on his king-sized bed and
thought of the girl with strawberry-blond hair and deep blue eyes.� The dream was too real.� Her taste was on his lips and her scent on
his body.� He looked at his erection,
expecting to see her virgin blood on his hard shaft and was relieved when it
wasn�t.� 

&nbsp;

Somewhere, a girl was crying for him
and he would find her.� No, more than a
girl.� She was a brave tigress and a
young innocent all wrapped in a beautiful package.� A treasure to be cherished
and protected.� A
companion to savor.� She was
steamy nights of hot sex and playful lovemaking and she wanted him.� A mate for him?� Was it possible after more than 800 years for
him to find someone who would love him and the demon within?� More importantly, did he find someone that he
could love unconditionally?

&nbsp;

Michael swore to himself.� He�d been so hungry for her that he didn�t
ask her name.� And she didn�t think
it.� Replaying the dream, he looked for
clues that would help him find his mystery virgin and felt a calm wash over
him.� The demonic part of him craved her
as much as his soul.� Michael decided to
start his search with the only vampire he knew named Nikolai, his sire.� 

&nbsp;

---

&nbsp;

Through her window, Nicole could see
the sun rising over the beach.� Her father
didn�t bother to knock.� Instead he
walked into the room and sat on her bed.�
She didn�t want to look up, afraid to see the anger on his face.� Well, not the anger.� More like the disappointment.� She didn�t know if she�d been screaming in
her sleep or broadcasting her dreams to the rest of the household.� Neither was a pleasant thought.� 

&nbsp;

Her father, Jesse Heyes, had
obviously been up for awhile.� He was
dressed in blue jeans and a dark t-shirt without shoes or socks.� She giggled aloud, wondering what Michael
would think of her father. �While she
grew older each year, he didn�t.� His
body had been frozen in time when he was a mere 25 years old.� �He had
been mated to a vampire and turned into a halfling, a human with vampiric blood
and strength, in the 1800�s.� She
wondered whether Michael was older or younger than her father.

&nbsp;

�Nikki, are you all right?�

&nbsp;

Looking into his blue eyes, she
shook her head.� His shoulder length,
honey blond hair fell in waves to his broad shoulders.� He hadn�t had time to brush it.� Maybe he hadn�t been awake as long as she
thought.� She giggled again then choked
back a sob.� 

&nbsp;

Jesse opened his arms and she
cuddled into him.� He held her like a
small child, rocking Nicole softly while she let the memory of her time with
Michael sink into her consciousness.� Her
sadness overwhelmed her and she cried for the loss of a man she�d never met.

&nbsp;

�Nikki, honey, it�s
okay.� I�m here.� It was just a dream.�

&nbsp;

�No, Dad, it was real and he wanted
me.� Nikolai killed him.�

&nbsp;

�Who wanted you?�

&nbsp;

�Michael.�

&nbsp;

�Think very carefully.� Did you see Nikolai kill him?�

&nbsp;

She shook her head again and her
father rubbed her back.

&nbsp;

�If you liked him, that�s a good
sign.� Later, when you�re feeling up to
it, I want you to show us your dream.�
Okay?�

&nbsp;

�Us� meant her father, mother, and
her vampire master.� Us
meant reading her thoughts and watching her dream as if they were her,
experiencing it.� Us
wasn�t going to happen.� She quickly
pulled out of his arms.

&nbsp;

�I�I can�t show you that!�

&nbsp;

�Jessica Nicole Heyes, just what
rating was this dream?�

&nbsp;

Her face reddened and her father
raised a knowing eyebrow.

&nbsp;

�Nikki?�

&nbsp;

�Triple X for sure.�

&nbsp;

�Perhaps I should kill this one
myself,� he joked and tickled Nicole.

&nbsp;

She squealed in delight and tickled
his ribs, knowing that her father would laugh and play with her.� He always made her feel safe.� Up until this moment in time, she had thought
she could tell him anything, but now she wasn�t as sure.� Abruptly, a look of horror crossed her face.

&nbsp;

�Dad, don�t you dare tell Mom about
this dream!�

&nbsp;

�It�s too late, honey.� Your mom sent me in here.� She says when your ready to talk, she�ll
listen.�

&nbsp;

�Oh.�� Nicole shook her head.� The joys of living in a psychic family were
never ending.� �Thanks, Dad.� I�m now beyond embarrassed.�� 

&nbsp;

They both laughed.� Jesse gave her a kiss on the forehead and
headed for the door.� 

&nbsp;

�See you at breakfast, honey.� I�ll drop you off at the university today and
if you�re feeling braver you can tell me about this Michael in private.�

&nbsp;

She nodded.� 

&nbsp;

�If he�s real, not just a dream��

&nbsp;

�You want to know if he can claim
you.�

&nbsp;

Jesse made it a statement, not a
question.� He knew.� He always seemed to know what she needed or
wanted.

&nbsp;

�Yes.�

&nbsp;

�Not just anyone can claim my
baby.� He will have to prove himself
worthy.�� 

&nbsp;

He sighed.� His eyes showed the wisdom that came from
seeing things others couldn�t imagine.

&nbsp;

�If he is worthy, and he is your
choice, then and only then, will I give my blessing.� Let�s hope for the best.�

&nbsp;

He stood and walked towards the
hallway.

&nbsp;

�Dad, thanks for understanding.�

&nbsp;

Turning, he grinned and winked.� Waves of happiness radiated from her
father.� He did his best to wrap her in
his psychic cocoon, yet they both knew that she wasn�t a baby anymore.� 

&nbsp;

�You�re most welcome, my princess.� Your humble servant can do no other.� 

&nbsp;

Laughing, Nicole tossed a pillow at
him.� She missed and it bounced off the
door as it shut.� Her smile turned to a
frown.� She felt a sense of loss that she
couldn�t explain.� Joking with her father
had helped, but now�� The tears came
unbidden. �What was wrong with her?� Tentatively, Nicole reached out with her
psychic energy to find the man in her dreams.�
It seemed she had taken this mental path before.� It was familiar, comforting and somewhat
unexpected.

&nbsp;

Michael�s determination to find her
flashed into her mind.� She could smell
him.� She felt his mind reading out for
her own.� Joy replaced sadness in a
single heartbeat. �He was real.� 

&nbsp;

�Michael?�

&nbsp;

His face entered her vision.� His eyes locked onto hers.� 

&nbsp;

�I�m coming for you, pet.� Fear not and be ready.�

&nbsp;

And thus, the courtship of Michael
and Nicole began.
