Synopsis: An icy business powerhouse finds herself trapped in a NYC phonebooth by the threats of a hidden watcher.Another Phone Booth
 �H-hello?� Janet picks up the phone, a look of vague curiosity on her coldly
  pretty face. &nbsp;At an icily preserved 38 years old, she's fought her way
  to the top of the heap at the Majors- Wankston Firm. &nbsp;She didn't get there
  by being sweet, and she didn't get there by being warm. &nbsp;She sure as shit
  didn't get there by answering payphones. &nbsp;But with her car gone belly
  up, her cell battery gone south, she'd had no choice but to step into the booth
  on 32 nd and Park Avenue�not to call a cab or otherwise get a ride, but to
  make a teleconference on time. &nbsp;Business doesn't wait�not if you want
  to stay on top. &nbsp;One look at her closed, wary face would tell anyone that �on
  top' is the only position Janet Rollins knows. &nbsp;
�Hello?� &nbsp;Her voice irritated now, as much with herself as with the still
  silent caller. &nbsp;Why did she pick up at all? &nbsp;Why does anyone pick
  up a ringing payphone? &nbsp;She rolls her eyes, moves to return the phone
  to cradle. �Snooze you lose, asshole.� 

�Don't hang up, Janet.� &nbsp;Voice low, smooth. &nbsp;

�Who is this?� &nbsp;Janet tugs at her lapel, eyebrows drawn down. &nbsp;�Jack?� 

�I don't know Jack, Janet.� &nbsp;A soft laugh. &nbsp;�I don't think you know
  Jack, either.� 

�Funny�who the fuck is this?� 

�You don't know me, Janet. &nbsp;But that's okay�I know you.� 

�Great, ever consider a career in comedy? &nbsp;&nbsp;No? &nbsp;Good thing. &nbsp;Now,
  Find someone else to get your jollies with, asshole.� 

�Why would I want to find someone else, Janet? &nbsp;I have you. &nbsp;Janet
  Rollins, 56192 East Central, number 14a Front. &nbsp;Janet? &nbsp;Janet, why
  so quiet?� 

�This isn't fucking funny.� 

�No. &nbsp;No, it isn't, is it, Janet? &nbsp;But I believe it will be fun. &nbsp;For
  me, anyway.� 

�Don't know how much fun you'll get talking to a dead line, asshole.� 

�The Birmingham deal, Janet? &nbsp;Oh, I see I have your attention now. &nbsp;&nbsp;Are
  you sure you want to hang up?� 

�I don't know what you're talking about.� &nbsp;&nbsp;Janet runs a hand through
  her perfectly coiffed hair�$250 every two weeks to keep it so sleek, so absolutely
  perfect. &nbsp;The hand--$200 a week to keep her nails shaped, painted in the
  muted power red she prefers. &nbsp;

�Of course you do, Janet. &nbsp;You only run your hand through that oh, so
  professional �do' when you're nervous.� A chuckle, the sound of a lighter flipping
  open. &nbsp;�That blue blouse really plays up your eyes�it must have been very
  expensive.� 

�I don't have to listen to this shit, I can hang up, walk away.� &nbsp;Janet's
  flat blue eyes dart, scanning the hundreds�thousands of windows, wondering
  which this person is peeping from. &nbsp;

�Did you know I have the Federal Trade Commission on speed dial, Janet? &nbsp;Isn't
  that funny? &nbsp;I think it's a riot.� 

Janet turns from the booth door, instinctively brings a hand up, hides her
  face as her voice drops to an angry whisper. &nbsp;�What the fuck do you want? &nbsp;Money? &nbsp;Is
  that it, you want money? &nbsp;Fine! &nbsp;Tell me how much.� 

�Oh, Janet, Janet, you really don't know me at all, do you? &nbsp;I don't
  want money, what would I do with money?� 

�Then what? &nbsp;Damn you, what do you want?� 

� Mmm , I want justice, Janet.� 

�Jus�what the fuck is that supposed to mean?� 

�The Birmingham deal, Janet. &nbsp;Your little deal brought you how many millions? &nbsp;And
  it gave ownership of 492 child-laborers to a known pornographer, a known flesh
  peddler.� 

�No! &nbsp;I don't know anything about that, I�we couldn't have children working
  for one of our holdings, we�� 

�Not we, Janet, you. &nbsp;You made the deal, you took home the cash, you
  paid off the inspectors.� 

�I got them out of a sweatshop!� &nbsp;Janet's voice cracks, sweat beading
  on her upper lip. 

�And into a whorehouse.� 

�That's not my concern, I'm a businesswoman, I�� 

�Don't care?� 

�No, you fuck, I don't care, why should I?� &nbsp;Janet slams a clenched fist
  against the plexiglass , oblivious to the stares of sidewalk denizens in the
  fading evening light. &nbsp;�It was business!� 

�And so is this, Janet.� 

�What do you want from me?� 

�What color is your bra, Janet?� &nbsp;Wry amusement, voice soft, taunting. 

� Wha �fuck you, fuck you!� 

�It's number two, in case you were wondering.� 

�What the fuck are you on about?� &nbsp;Janet's voice is shaky, her blush
  standing out starkly on her now pale cheeks. 

�The Federal Trade Commission, Janet. &nbsp;Number two on speed dial. &nbsp;Janet? &nbsp;Janet,
  are you still with me? &nbsp;Don't sulk, dear, it's not becoming.� 

�Blue.� &nbsp;Janet's voice is husky, enraged. 

�I'm sorry, Janet, I didn't hear that�say it again?� 

�It's blue, you fuck, my bra is blue!� 

�Good girl. &nbsp;I'd like to see it, Janet.� 

�I'd fucking die first.� 

�And you just may�bad things in happen to uppity bitches in prison. &nbsp;Oh,
  my�yes, Janet, prison. &nbsp;That's where people like you go when they get
  caught, isn't it?� 

Janet moans, a low, frustrated sound, her eyes squeezing shut, hand rising,
  swiping the sweat from her brow. &nbsp;�I hope you rot in hell.� 

�I'm sure you do, Janet�but all things considered, you might want to spend
  a little more time considering the state of your soul rather than mine.� 

�Fine, you piece of shit excuse for a human, here you go.� &nbsp;Janet hisses,
  lips pulled back in an impotent snarl as her fingers begin fumbling with the
  buttons of her silk blouse. 

�Don't unbutton, Janet�grab that soft fabric, give it a good tug, rip it open.� 

Janet gives a sharp whine, grabs the silk, yanks, sending buttons flying. &nbsp;

�Oh, my, yes. &nbsp;You are angry, aren't you? &nbsp;Pull it open, Janet,
  untuck your blouse, let it fall open.� 

�You motherfucker , you god damned motherfucker !� &nbsp;Janet's voice is
  trembling as she yanks the blouse wide, reveals her C-cup breasts encased in
  thin, hand tatted lace. &nbsp;She looks up, sees that she has an audience�two
  men, eyes wide, mouths frozen in disbelieving smiles. &nbsp;Men come to this
  corner to drop their cash on the adult theaters, the strip joints. &nbsp;It's
  not often they get a free show. 

�Very nice, Janet. &nbsp;Oh, yes, very nice. &nbsp;You take very good care
  of yourself, don't you, Janet?� &nbsp;A low, amused laugh. &nbsp;�It would
  appear your audience agrees. &nbsp;Give them a smile, Janet, touch your breasts
  for them.� 

�Please don't do this.� &nbsp;Janet's voice breaks, tears brimming. 

�Please? &nbsp;Please? &nbsp;I think that's a first, isn't it, Janet? &nbsp;Are
  you begging?� 

�Yes, damn you, yes, I'm begging!� 

�I think I like you like this, Janet.� &nbsp;A pause, the sound of smoke being
  inhaled, exhaled slowly. &nbsp;�But sadly, I really do need you to do this,
  Janet. &nbsp;Now.� 

�I won't.� &nbsp;Janet's voice small, quavering. 

�Yes you will, Janet. &nbsp;Surely your lifestyle, you job, your homes, your
  cars, your jewelry, surely those are worth a few moments of embarrassment,
  aren't they?� 

Janet whines, her head thrown back, eyes squeezing back tears as her hand
  rises slowly, haltingly cupping a breast, a strained, thin lipped smile on
  her lips. 

�Squeeze it, pinch the nipple through that pretty lace.� 

Nodding, blushing furiously, Janet complies. &nbsp;�There, you sick fuck,
  happy? &nbsp;Are you happy?� 

�Getting happier by the moment, Janet. &nbsp;Hook your fingers under that
  lace, tear the cup open.� 

�Oh, Christ, oh, please stop this, I will do anything�� 

�I know you will. &nbsp;You're doing it now. &nbsp;Now obey me. &nbsp;Tear
  it open.� 

Janet looks up, tears spilling from her wide eyes, trailing down her trembling
  face. &nbsp;Four men now. &nbsp;Four men watching her, their expressions open,
  frankly aroused. &nbsp;With a low moan, she grasps the expensive lace, jerks
  hard. &nbsp;Once, twice, the delicate material surprising strong. &nbsp;With
  a frustrated yell, she yanks violently, the sound of the lace giving so loud. &nbsp;Her
  breast spills out, upturned, nipple stiff. &nbsp;Another man joins the crowd. &nbsp;She
  whimpers, turns away. 

�Turn back around, Janet.� 

�N-no, please.� 

�Do it now. &nbsp;And tell me, Janet, what color are your underwear? &nbsp;I'll
  bet they match, don't they? &nbsp;Pull up that power skirt and show me.� 

�If you wanted to humiliate me, you have, if you wanted to shame me, you have,
  please, please stop now.� &nbsp;She turns slowly, eyes the growing crowd fearfully. &nbsp;Two
  women have joined, their eyes sharp, hateful, their dress proclaiming them
  prostitutes. &nbsp;

�We're not done yet, Janet. &nbsp;Not even close. &nbsp;Now show me your little
  panties. &nbsp;Right now.� 

�Oh, God, please, they think I'm a whore, please . . .� 

�What do you call a woman who sells her soul for a few bucks? &nbsp;&nbsp;I'd
  say you are a whore, Janet. &nbsp;They do come in all shapes and sizes.� &nbsp;A
  sharp laugh, the faint sound of fingers tapping. &nbsp;�Lift your skirt�or
  I hang up. &nbsp;And if I hang up, you might have one day to get out of the
  country before your whole life comes crashing down around you.� 

Janet whimpers, a trembling hand catching the hem of her light linen skirt,
  lifting haltingly until her garter, panties are revealed, both the same jewel
  blue of the bra. &nbsp;

�Oh, very, very pretty, Janet. &nbsp;Tell me, are they bikini or thong?� 

� Th -thong.� &nbsp;Janet's voice is weak, stammering, her eyes down, not
  daring look up at the increasingly raucous crowd gathering around the booth. 

�You hardly sound the ultra-professional bitch now, Janet, what's wrong? &nbsp;&nbsp;Squeamish? &nbsp;I
  can't believe that, after all, you're the woman who sold children into prostitution
  and porn. &nbsp;Did you know that Thailand is the largest producer of child
  porn? &nbsp;And snuff?� &nbsp;Voice hard now, venomous. &nbsp;�A child prostitute
  in Bangkok can expect to live approximately 3 years from the time they enter
  the trade. &nbsp;How does that make you feel, Janet?� 

�I-I'm sorry.� &nbsp;Janet begins to sob softly, her hand still clutching
  her skirt, holding it above her hips. 

�No, you're sorry you got caught. &nbsp;But that's okay, Janet�I'm going to
  help you make amends. &nbsp;Turn around.� 

� Wh -why?� 

�Because I told you to. &nbsp;Because you lie so much that I want to see for
  myself if that pretty scrap of material covering your icy cunt is really a
  thong.� 

Janet turns, sobbing harder, pulling the skirt up in back, showing that she
  is, indeed, wearing a thong. &nbsp;

�Wiggle your ass.� 

�Oh, God.� 

�For a woman who hasn't seen the inside of a church in over 10 years, you
  certainly do invoke the name of Our Lord with appalling frequency. � A cough,
  a low laugh. &nbsp;�Of course, it is said that the Lord doth love the sinner
  better than the saint, as the sinner is in greater need of God's love. &nbsp;Now
  shake those hips. &nbsp;Wiggle that ass.� 

Janet complies, her legs trembling, slim, well muscled thighs trembling as
  her lovely ass works from side to side, eliciting a rousing cheer from the
  growing crowd of spectators. &nbsp;

�Press it against the glass, move your hips like you're fucking it.� 

�Please . . .� 

�No pleading necessary, Janet. &nbsp;Bend over and fuck the glass or the FTC
  fucks you. &nbsp;Pretty simple.� 

Janet's pretty ass presses against the ass, her hips grinding, her neatly
  trimmed pussy lips peeking with each thrust, her body shaken by her deep, devastated
  sobs. &nbsp;The booth begins to shake, a brave bystander striding forward,
  grasping the sides of the booth, his hips slamming against the plexiglass in
  an obscene parody of intercourse. &nbsp;

�Stand up, Janet�you are shameless, I declare.� 

Janet straightens, stumbles back, away from her ardent admirer. &nbsp;Her
  face is a mask of horror, eyes darting from face to hungry face. &nbsp;

�Reach up, Janet, move the light cover.� 

�Please, please, why?� 

�Because I told you to, Janet. &nbsp;The longer you question me, the longer
  this goes on�and who knows how long the natives will be satisfied with just
  watching?� 

Janet's shaking hands push the plastic cover aside, skitter along the narrow
  shelf, seeking, then finding. &nbsp;She grasps the object, pulls it down with
  a horrified gasp, the crowd shouting, howling as she holds the huge dildo in
  her trembling fingers. &nbsp;

�What's wrong, Janet, not big enough for you?� 

�You can't, please, you can't ask me . . .� 

�I'm telling you, Janet. &nbsp;Sit on the bench, pull those sleazy little
  panties down, and fuck yourself for the crowd.� 

�I won't.� &nbsp;Her voice, teary, shaky, her glistening red lips pulled down
  in a miserable frown. &nbsp;

�In prison they'll use their fists up that tight twat, bottles, iron bars,
  broom handles�whatever they can get their fat hands on. &nbsp;And you won't
  even have that pricey flat to go home to, that fancy claw foot tub to soak
  it all away in.� 

Janet stumbles back, sits hard on the cold metal bench, her legs spreading
  slowly, one hand still clutching the phone, the other clasping the monstrous
  dildo. &nbsp;Whimpering, whining, she lifts her skirt, struggles to work her
  panties down to the building chant from the crowd. &nbsp;Tilting her hips up,
  she pushes the ugly pink tip against her pussy, tears flowing freely, her free
  breast jiggling with her sobs. &nbsp;

� Mmm , what's that they're shouting, Janet? &nbsp;Shove it in, shove it in? &nbsp;&nbsp;I
  think that sounds like a fine idea. &nbsp;So shove it in. &nbsp;&nbsp;Shove
  it in that tight, cold cunt of yours, shove it all the way in, I want to see
  it disappear into that mean snatch of yours.� 

� Mmplease , please, if you want to fuck me, just tell me where to meet you,
  I'll fuck you, please, I'll fuck�� 

�Fuck you?� &nbsp;His laugh is harsh, derisive. &nbsp;�Sweetheart, I wouldn't
  touch that kooz of yours with the proverbial ten foot pole. &nbsp;Now shove
  it in, whore. &nbsp;Shove it deep.� 

Janet sobs, balancing the phone between shoulder and ear as she reaches down,
  parts her pussy lips, her shaking fingers working down, deeper, holding herself
  open as the other hand brings the dildo into place, begins pushing. &nbsp;The
  jostling crowd moves in closer, eyes starving, devouring her as she whines,
  head back, hips twitching to accommodate this pink latex beast. &nbsp;She bites
  her lip, moaning with pain as her pussy stretches, the dildo catches, tears
  as she shoves harder. &nbsp;A small cry escapes her trembling lips as the last
  inches grind into her, filling her. 

�Now fuck yourself with it. &nbsp;Like you fucked those little children, fuck
  yourself hard.� 

Janet's eyes stare up, red rimmed, mascara running, her hips moving in a dull,
  mindless rhythm as she shoves the giant dildo into her pretty pussy again and
  again. &nbsp;Her ears roar, are filled by the obscene cheers of the men peering
  in. &nbsp;Some have unzipped their flies, taken their stiff, angry cocks out,
  are jerking off furiously to her show. &nbsp;An enterprising pimp has begun
  working the crowd, promising personal shows for those willing to cough up the
  cash. &nbsp;

�Fuck it harder, fuck it like the whore you are.� 

Janet's hips rise, fall, rise again, the cruel metal of the bench biting into
  her ass, her arm aching, pussy burning. &nbsp;She tries to find a prayer, but
  realizes with a desolate start that she doesn't remember any. &nbsp;The pimp
  shoves through the crowd, his pockets bulging as he pounds on the door. &nbsp;Janet
  looks up, her eyes glassy, swollen with tears as she shakes her head slowly,
  miserably. &nbsp;

�Pull it out, Janet. Pull it out and suck it.� 

Janet obeys numbly, her tongue moving slowly, lapping at the wet tip. &nbsp;With
  a sick moan, she opens her mouth, her shining lips wrapping around the thick
  latex, her eyes dull, flat above. &nbsp;

�Shove it deep, Janet, gag on it.� &nbsp;His voice is thick now, raspy. &nbsp;

Janet gags miserably, her nostrils flaring as she fucks her face with the
  dildo. &nbsp;Her legs still spread, her pussy red, wetness shining on her sparse,
  so neatly trimmed brown hair. &nbsp;She continues mindlessly, waiting for him
  to tell her to stop, her eyes locked on the pimp kicking at the door. 

�I'm sorry, Janet, I was called away, I�oh, my�you're not still fucking that
  viper's mouth of yours are you? &nbsp;Oh, goodness, how funny!� &nbsp;His laugh
  is deep, booming, more Santa than Satan. &nbsp;She whines, he laughs again. &nbsp;�You
  can take it out of your mouth now.� His tone is light, dismissive. &nbsp;�Oh,
  and open the door.� 

�N-no, no, please, they'll hurt me . . . � Janet's voice is husky, words slurred. 

�Yes, I imagine they will. &nbsp;Think of how bad it would be if you were
  6 years old�like some of those children you condemned to a miserable, agonizing,
  dehumanizing death. &nbsp;I would think it would be easy to fuck a 6 year old
  to death, wouldn't you?� &nbsp;

� Mmmplease , I said I was sorry, I said�� 

�I don't believe you. &nbsp;Not yet. &nbsp;Now open the door�and if you drop
  that phone, my next call is to you-know-who.� 

Janet rises shakily, swaying on her heels as she grapples with the door, slides
  it open. &nbsp;The pimp's beefy hand grabs her hair, his gold toothed smile
  broad as he tries to pull her from the booth. 

�N- noo !� Janet screams, jerking back, batting at him with her free hand. &nbsp;�In
  the booth, only in the booth!� &nbsp;She squeals, twists out of his rough grasp,
  losing a handful of her now not-so-perfect hair in the process. &nbsp;�I can't
  hang up, I can't hang up the phone, please, please, anything you want to do,
  do it in here.� 

�Tell him you want to take them all on in the booth, as many at a time as
  will fit.� 

�Please, please, ohhh , I'm going to do this, mmmplease don't�� 

�Say it!� 

Janet look into the pimp's sneering face, moans, �I want to take on as many
  as can fit in the booth, p-p-please.� 

Janet grunts, whines, her slim body shaking, battered between the two eager
  men. &nbsp;Her tight asshole bleeding, tearing as each punishing thrust lifts
  her off her heels, her pussy filled, raw as the men fuck her furiously, sandwiching
  her cruelly. &nbsp;Her skirt hangs in tatters, the fine linen shredded away
  to give easier access. &nbsp;Her delicate lace thong hangs desolately from
  one trembling leg, rough hands clawing, mauling her breasts, both uncovered
  now. &nbsp;One small hand, nails broken, bleeding, pawing at the steamed up
  plexiglass , struggling to maintain her balance while the other hand clutches
  the phone to her ear in sick obedience. 

The booth is filled with their panting, grunting, her thighs slick, coated
  with cum from the others. &nbsp;Her lipstick smeared, mascara dark under her
  eyes, her cheeks, chin, chest smeared in cooling spunk. &nbsp;She grunts, moans
  as the cock in her ass explodes, adding to the hefty collection of cum already
  filling her cramping bowels. &nbsp;But her mind is distant, only barely registering
  the new body behind her, the rough prodding, poking, then brutal penetration. &nbsp;To
  her it's all one agonizing nightmare, all the men on her have the same foul
  breath, the same leering faces, the same thick, punishing cocks. &nbsp;It's
  as if there is only one man, fat, smelly, mean, filling her magically with
  the same stinking meat. &nbsp;What she focuses on is the sound of his voice. &nbsp;His
  voice. &nbsp;Ridiculing her, reminding her that this is no worse than the fate
  she brought down upon innocent children. &nbsp;Admonishing her to keep that
  phone to her ear, to take it like the whore she is. &nbsp;She whines, brought
  to her knees as a new cock, the same cock, bobs before her swollen, puffy lips. &nbsp;Her
  mouth drops open automatically, her head jerked back as the thick meat grinds
  mercilessly into her sore, aching throat. &nbsp;Thighs jerked apart, another
  inside her pussy, another in her battered ass. &nbsp;Her eyes wide, glazed
  with shock, pain, but her mind on the voice. &nbsp;Waiting. &nbsp;Waiting for
  him to tell her. &nbsp;To tell her she's paid her debt, she's fulfilled her
  obligation. &nbsp;

Janet whines, the cock in her pale, slimy face spewing cum into her unprotesting
  mouth. &nbsp;She sputters, swallows, throat working, milking, her mind tiredly
  noting that she's developed a system, one that allows her to breathe while
  sucking, eating cock. &nbsp;Cum spatters her face as her latest user withdraws,
  globs in her eye, another up her nose, setting off a spate of hacking, gagging. &nbsp;

�Janet?� 

She moans, bouncing violently with the double fucking of her ass and pussy. 

�Janet, are you paying attention?� 

Janet whimpers, tries to speak, her jaws too sore, mouth too swollen, throat
  too bruised. 

�That's a good whore. &nbsp;Do you want to stop now, Janet?� 

Her eyes widen, she whines high, begins squirming, twisting between the men
  crushing her. 

�Ask me, Janet, beg.� 

� Mmmplease , mmmm unna stob mmplease .� &nbsp;Her eyes, swollen, red, glassy,
  roll up hopefully, pitifully, pleading. &nbsp;� Mmmm , p-p-p- leeeaase .� 

�Janet?� 

Another cock in her face, she turns her head aside, resisting for the first
  time since the phonebooth door opened. &nbsp;

�Janet? &nbsp;Are you listening? &nbsp;I hear the regret in your voice, Janet,
  I hear the pain, the remorse. &nbsp;And I'm a nice guy, Janet, I am. &nbsp;So
  I've listened to you begging me, and I have one thing to say . . .� 

Gagging, whimpering, Janet's bruised, bloodied hand rises shakily, pushing
  against the fat, sweating hip of the man fucking her face, her nostrils flaring,
  bruised lips stretched wide around his thick shaft. &nbsp;It's over, she knows
  it's over, she can stop, this can end, please, please this can end. 

�Janet? &nbsp;Janet? &nbsp;Are you listening? &nbsp;My answer is &nbsp;. .
  . no. &nbsp;&nbsp;Janet? &nbsp;&nbsp;Janet, are you there? &nbsp;I said no. &nbsp;No. &nbsp;No.� &nbsp;

Janet screams rawly around the cock in her face, her ear filled with the uproarious
  laughter of her tormentor, his answer to her pleas echoing in her stunned mind
  as her head is jerked back, giving passage to her swollen, tortured throat.
