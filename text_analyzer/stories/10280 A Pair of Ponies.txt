A Pair of Ponies
by Timidbruin


Three text messages went out instantaneously, each to their own eager recipient.&nbsp; Short and straight to the point they all informed almost the same things, the three recipients were all required by their Mistress to attend an as yet unknown event.&nbsp; Each of the three male submissives were ordered to be available for a specific day to serve their shared Mistress, none of them knowing that the other two had also received her summons.&nbsp; They all knew of each other and at times had even met and had sessions together under their Mistress, but they all had their own special one on one relationships with her.

She loved each of them in turn as only a Domme could.&nbsp; They all had somewhat similar wants and needs that attracted her desires, but by having the three of them, she could specialise play for each of them depending on her needs.&nbsp; She could also then give each of them enough and push their limits, yet still have another one ready for some play, keeping them all in a constant state of wanting to please her.&nbsp; Her planning had been long and thorough, the messages were nothing more than another link in the chain.&nbsp; She was out to not only give all three of them the day of their lives, but to show her peers the love she had gained from her trio of pets.

She arrived at the State BDSM and Fetish Fair early in the sunlit morning, groups of people, both normally dressed and fetishists, went about setting up stalls and displays, including a large grand stage at the center of the main arena.&nbsp; Her own plans still on track as she registered herself and her sub's attendance, she then lodged two entry forms to the fair officials.&nbsp; Looking to her watch she smiled at the thought of her three little pets, rising and preparing to please her on the little information she had given them.&nbsp; 

The gothic dressed official handed the registration papers back to the Mistress, �Looks like you're in for a special day,� she said, a wicked smile breaking across her face.
�Thank you so much, and it will be special once my pets arrive.&nbsp; Which way is it to my stables?�
The registrations clerk pointed further into the fair, �Follow the path around the track, once you go past the food stalls and pet cages, you will see the old wooden stables, that is the area you requested.&nbsp; If you get to the KY pool, then you have gone too far.&nbsp; I believe your area should be set up to your liking, but if there are any issues please don't hesitate to let us know�
�Thank you again, you have been wonderful,�&nbsp; She gave the clerk one last friendly smile and headed off deep into the fetish fair to her awaiting attraction.

Each of the submissives felt their nerves building.&nbsp; Although she had not told them what they were doing she had given them a date and place, a quick google search later, each of them had worked out they were off to the fair.&nbsp; They had each read and reread their message over and over as the days had counted down.&nbsp; Now on the morning of the fair, they individually planned what they could and waited until it was time to serve their Mistress as per her instructions.

Fifteen minutes before the allotted arrival time, two of her subs bumped into each other at the nearby train station.&nbsp; They had not expected to see each other, but neither were surprised either.&nbsp; They nodded a mutual respect, one of deep knowing, and each kept a comfortable silence between them.&nbsp; They fell into step together as they walked through the vanilla world towards a unique cultural fair of wonderment and desires.

Arriving outside the main gate, they found the third of her privately owned trio already waiting.&nbsp; Nods exchanged, they now stood together, not a word uttered but a common bond and understanding joining them together.&nbsp; They waited the final minutes, on the stroke of the clock she walked out through the main gate to meet them.&nbsp; 

Their collective jaws dropped as their Mistress approached them.&nbsp; She wore a polished latex catsuit that hid no part of her perfect form, her curvaceous body amplified by the shiny black coating.&nbsp; She had the suit custom made for this very event, and it gave her the look of jodhpurs by way of silver inner thighs that continued up to her tight behind.&nbsp; Around her waist was a ribbed leather corset, made to resemble an English riding vest, complete with red leather tie.&nbsp; Her legs covered from the knee down by tight traditional leather riding boots, their own shine a tribute to the latex above.&nbsp; Her long black straight hair, now cut short and sitting just about her shoulders, giving a classy defining purpose to her look.&nbsp; 

She strode towards them, her demeanour emanating that of the Domme she truly was.&nbsp; Seeing her trio together and awaiting her had lit the fire within and she found her true self come out.&nbsp; She carried a leash and studded leather collar in one hand, and a crop in the other.&nbsp; Standing before them, she looked over each of them in turn.&nbsp; They had done as instructed and wore normal vanilla clothing.&nbsp; Two of her pets were of the same hight and build, the third, a bit shorter had a much stockier build.&nbsp; It was the short one she took too first.

Motioning him to come forth and kneel, he complied and dropped at her feet, looking up his gaze transfixed to hers.&nbsp; Roughly she reached out and locked the studded collar around his neck.&nbsp; It was a new collar for him, and although he didn't see it, the tag riveted to the front read 'Bitch'.&nbsp; She clipped the leash to the D ring over the name-tag, and wrapped the leash around her hand several times before firmly pulling him against her side.&nbsp; �Heal, Bitch,� she barked at him.&nbsp; Scrambling about he quickly turned to her side and awaited her next command.&nbsp; Breaking her attention from Bitch, she turned back to the other two, both wishing to be in his place.&nbsp; 

�You two have some free time before you are required,�&nbsp; She reached up and pulled two admission tickets from under her corset, all the while yanking on Bitch's leash pinning him to her thigh.&nbsp; �These are for you,� she said handing them over to one of the submissives. �You have 20 minutes until you are required, I hope that you are both wearing what I have instructed as there will be repercussions for all three of you if you have failed.�&nbsp; She then turned away from them both and headed back into the Fair.&nbsp; They stood and watched as their Mistress left pulling Bitch by his leash so that he could neither walk upright or follow on all fours, just trapped into a crouched hobble behind her.

Once she was out of sight, they took a look at each other and headed into the fair together, naturally falling into step side by side.&nbsp; By their body size and mannerisms it would be easy to mistake them for brothers, but this was a trait she had already identified within her two pets and was wanting to exploit.

As they entered they both took delight in the sights and sounds of the fair.&nbsp; There were people of all walks of life, male and female, young and old, all having a day of naughty excitement and wonderment.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The fair itself was a mix of stalls and displays all set in and around an equestrian racetrack.&nbsp; Inside the track there was a large stage set up at one end with a band working their magic to the audience sitting on blankets spread across the lush green grass.&nbsp; Behind the band were two large video displays, one cycling through creative advertisements for the fair sponsors, the other with scrolling text of the day's itinerary.&nbsp; At a glance the stage was going to be constantly rolling with different things throughout the day, from music to displays and lectures, to competitions for the attendees.&nbsp; 

The two guys made their way further into the fair, they couldn't see where their Mistress had gone, so firstly they had to work out where she was going to want them.&nbsp; They started walking out and around the main arena and followed the path amongst the stalls.&nbsp; Slipping from stall to stall, they didn't see her, just an array of custom BDSM gear and toys, for all parts of the body and types of play.&nbsp; Both wanting to stop and enjoy the wears but the clock counting down kept them moving.&nbsp; Passed the shop stalls they passed by an area filled with varying sizes of cages, some empty others with human puppies or slaves locked away awaiting their owners return.&nbsp; They both took the time to read the warning sign staked at the entrance. 

'THIS IS NOT A PETTING ZOO!&nbsp; 

ALL PETS AND SLAVES LEFT AT THEIR OWNERS RISK.&nbsp; 

PLEASE DO NOT DISTURB THAT WHICH DOES NOT BELONG TO YOU.&nbsp; 

PLEASE CLEAN UP YOUR PETS MESS BEFORE LEAVING.'

Looking in they both felt envy for the pets already locked away, dressed or not dressed as their owners wished, they had nothing but a freedom from the real world and complete dependence on the one they love.&nbsp; Both of them looked for Bitch, but he was not there, she must still have him by her side.

They continued around the fair and came to some older wooden stables.&nbsp; They had be saved as a reminder of the heritage of the track, and had been unused since the new modern stables were built a few years before.&nbsp; Now they stood out amongst the new facilities and modern layout, but were loved for their reminder back to yesteryear.

Two of the individual stalls were roped off and an 'A' framed sign was covered with a blanket in front of the entrance.&nbsp; As the only display yet to open they were both intrigued and started to look for their Mistress.&nbsp; She was nowhere to be seen, but as they started to walk around to see what was behind the stables Bitch came out on all fours.&nbsp; It was obvious to them that he had been ordered out to scare them away.&nbsp; 

He was now dressed very differently then how they had last seen him.&nbsp; Locked in Leather shorts with padlocks on the belt and each thigh, and a large antique iron padlock securing the panel across the front of the shorts.&nbsp; A thick studded leather harness tightly bound around his muscular chest.&nbsp; His hands encased in locked black mitts, and knee pads protecting him from the gravel.&nbsp; His mouth and chin was covered by leather pup muzzle, with straps wrapping firmly around and over his head.&nbsp; It was obvious by his muffled barking that he also had a sizable gag locked away underneath.&nbsp; 

He did his best to be threatening, throwing is whole body into his furious barking, only being held back by his leash now attached behind the stables.&nbsp; As they looked at Bitch, they both smiled, knowing him and their joint Mistress, he was doing his job, and loving every second of it.&nbsp; They took the hint and with still 14 minutes until they were required, they took their leave and walked away.&nbsp; At the first sign of them turning Bitch quietened down, his victory sweet.&nbsp; As he turned and crawled back behind the stables, they both watched his rubbery tail wiggle about, sticking out through his leather shorts.

Knowing where to go they both split up to take in the sights.&nbsp; They didn't fully understand what was planned for them, so now was the chance to soak in as much as possible.&nbsp; They knew Mistress has something special planned, but that did not mean that they would get to see the fair.&nbsp; Both of them watched the time intently as they went about, even finding time to eat, drink and relive themselves as they did not know what the future still held.&nbsp; With a minute to spare they both arrived back at the stables and stood awaiting at a respectable distance where their Mistress could find them.&nbsp; 

Again she did not disappoint with a grand entrance comming around from behind the stables, still adorned in her incredible outfit and with Bitch held tight by her side.&nbsp; She did not lose her stride as she crossed the ground towards her eager submissives.&nbsp; Careful not to flinch or show any disobedience, they stood perfectly at attention, unfortunately for them, right in the middle of the path leading around the track.&nbsp; She looked them both up and down, inspecting them, looking for a mistake.

�Vanilla clothes off.&nbsp; And you had both better be wearing what I instructed,� she indirectly barked to them both.

Together they started to disrobe in the middle of the fairs foot-traffic.&nbsp; First taking off their shirts, revealing black Lycra bodysuits underneath.&nbsp; Almost as a race they stripped amongst the other wandering patrons, making sure to neatly fold and stack their common clothes as they went.&nbsp; She watched them intently as they each squirmed at the order given.&nbsp; Neither of them were experienced with public displays of submission, and now found themselves putting all of their trust in her, in this uncomfortable location.

As they finished and returned to a stance of attention, their clothes neatly in front of them, she looked them over once more.&nbsp; Their bodies and modesty protected by little more than a wafer thin layer of stretch fabric.&nbsp; Covered from foot to wrist their bodies a neat silhouette in the late morning sunshine, two silhouettes that were almost perfectly alike.

�That's much better, good to see you can still follow the simplest of instructions.�&nbsp; She dropped the leash and motioned for Bitch to stay.&nbsp; Walking around she reached out and ran her fingernails across each of them in turn, seductively stroking and petting them as they stood like statues.&nbsp; With a harsh slap to the arse and a grab to a now not so well hidden hardening cock, she did her best to unsettle their stances.&nbsp; Pleasantly rewarded by their tough resolve to serve, they never moved an inch, as the crowds continued to walk around them.

She motioned Bitch to stand up from his kneeling position and walk on two feet with her back into the stables.&nbsp; Without any orders the two silhouettes stood fast, not daring to upset the apple cart, now nothing more than an obstacle for the hordes of fetish minded patrons.&nbsp; She took off Bitch's leash and hung it over the divider between the stalls, she then unlocked and removed his mitts freeing his fingers.&nbsp; He grunted a sigh relief, a sign that the gag was still jammed in his mouth under the leather muzzle.&nbsp; She took two pairs of handcuffs from a hook in the stable and handed one set to Bitch.

They walked back out into the sunlight, Bitch a half step behind the Mistress, and they went straight behind the statues promptly locking their wrists behind their backs.&nbsp; Their first binding of a long and rewarding day.&nbsp; Grabbing a submissive by the arm each, they lead each of the black bodies into the shade of the stalls and turned them around to face the crowd walking by.

Bitch hooked a rope across the front of each of the stalls and walked off behind the stables, as Mistress enjoyed her two submissives following her desires perfectly.&nbsp; She knew they would be a little uncomfortable at first but by the end each would be left begging her for more of her special treats.&nbsp; Returning with two large luggage bags, Bitch put one in each of the stalls, being careful to put them behind and out of sight of the two silhouettes.&nbsp; He then returned to the foot of their Mistress, kneeling before her and revelling at the praise of a pat to his head.

A one finger gesture, and he dropped to the ground laying at her feet.&nbsp; �Good Bitch, Stay.�

She stepped over the laying pup and into the first stall.&nbsp; Walking straight past her pet, she went to the bag now sitting at the back of the stall.&nbsp; Unzipping the top she smiled to herself at the array of pony gear, carefully selected and custom made within.&nbsp; She rummaged about and found the items she was looking for, placing one item on the ground she took the other in hand and approached her apprehensive submissive from behind.

He had been listening to her behind him, and knew she had returned with something, but now she just stood there.&nbsp; She lent in closer and let her breath tickle the back of his neck.&nbsp; As he took in a deep breath, she took the moment and slipped the Lycra hood over his head.&nbsp; It was the same black Lycra as the bodysuit and covered his whole head, leaving only his face exposed.&nbsp; She walked around him, tucking the long neck of the hood under the bodysuit, leaving only his hands and face for the world to see.

Once she had circled him she went back to the bag and picked up the other item.&nbsp; This item she stopped and admired, it was hand made and she had two of them, one for each of her special submissives.&nbsp; She had been waiting for this moment since she first day she had the idea of making her own pony-boys, and now after a lot of time and effort, she was enjoying the control of creating her dream scenario.&nbsp; She took the custom pony mask and walked back in front of her pet.

�Do you know what this is?� she asked as she tenderly held the mask up in front him.

Not sure of the response she was looking for he just politely nodded to her, his eyes transfixed on the beautiful mask.&nbsp; Looking to her right she saw her other pony straining to look across without moving his head.&nbsp; �It's ok, I have another one for you too.�&nbsp; she smiled to him, somehow releasing any anxiety either of them had.

As she lifted the leather mask up to his face, he instinctively opened his mouth for the bit.&nbsp; Taking the metal gag between his teeth, the bit pushed the corners of this mouth back a little.&nbsp; She pushed it back a little more until the mask sealed against the Lycra around his face.&nbsp; With her other hand she slipped one of the straps over his head and tightened it holding the hood in place.&nbsp; She then slowly and methodically did up the other two straps, locking the mask to his head.&nbsp; Sliding it about to find the best purchase on his face, she then stood back to see her first pony-boy.&nbsp; It was as she had dreamed, with his identity taken, the mask had not only changed his look, but also his demeanour.&nbsp; Without so much of a word, the mask alone had sent him into a sub-space and his posture had switched to that of a pony-boy

Inside the mask his world changed, as she tightened the straps behind this head he took his first deep breath within the mask, his nostrils assaulted by the sweet smell of worked leather.&nbsp; The straps also pulled the bit further into his mouth, his tongue now playing with the metal invader.&nbsp; He opened his eyes, unsure of when he had closed them, and saw his new limited pony vision, only able to see out to the sides, and not directly in front of himself.&nbsp; It took a few breaths, but his mind had slipped to a better place, the exhilaration filling his entire body as his identity changed.

He looked forward as best he could through the mask to see his pleased Mistress before him, her face a picture of delight.&nbsp; Stretching his face as best as the hood would allow, it now felt natural to him, a part of him.&nbsp; He was her pony-boy

She stood and admired him for a few moments, watching as he came to happy terms with his new self, then turned to switch to the other stall.&nbsp; As she turned she was surprised by the small crowd that had gathered and was watching her and her ponies from the rope at the stall entrance.&nbsp; Even she had been so lost in the moment that she had not seen nor heard them.&nbsp; Unable to wipe the smile from her face she continued to move to the other stall, making her way through the gathering.

�Are these new ponies?� asked a bear Dom, his gagged slave in a straight jacket kneeling behind him.
�Yes, it's their initiation,� she replied.
�They are beautiful, you should be very proud of them,� he smiled to her.
�Thank you, I am.&nbsp; They still have a long way to go though, and they have a long day ahead of them.&nbsp; Let's see how they feel at the end of it.�

The crowd parted for her, allowing her to attend her other soon to be pony.&nbsp; As he already knew what was in store for him she took her time, and gave him some teasing petting before giving him his pony mask.&nbsp; He was as hard as an iron bar by the time she had finished strapping up his head, and he too instantly dropped into a pony sub-space.&nbsp; Giving his pony nose a rub, he let out a grumble of content to his Mistress from within the thick leather.&nbsp; 

She stroked his body as she passed to get more items from the bag at the back of the stall.&nbsp; This time she returned with some long thick ropes with clips on each end.&nbsp; Attaching one end to one side of the mask-bit she then attached the other end of the lead to an anchor point on the wall of the stall.&nbsp; She then did the same on the other side of the pony.&nbsp; The weight of the ropes now pulling slightly on his mask-bit and in turn that was attached to the bit secured inside his mouth.&nbsp; He could feel the weighty ropes and when he tried to turn his head or move from his spot the ropes went taught and the sensation was relayed directly through his mouth.&nbsp; 

Before moving back to her other pony to get his ropes in place, she unlocked the handcuffs holding his hands at bay.&nbsp; At first he brought his arms around to his side, but it did not feel natural, so instinctively put his hands together behind his back, just as they were.&nbsp; She gave him one last pat on the rump before switching stalls and preparing her other pony.

After roping both ponies to the center of their stalls and removing the handcuffs, she stood back with the crowd to admire her work with the identical steeds.&nbsp; She motioned to Bitch still laying on the ground surrounded by the assembled crowd, he leapt to her beckoning.&nbsp; Pushing through the forest of legs surrounding him, he was eager to reach the next step of her plan.&nbsp; Once at her feet he looked up to her and she gave him a lovingly pet on the head before signalling him up from her feet.&nbsp; He stood without hesitation and enjoyed the few looks he had drawn from his Mistress's touch.&nbsp; Toe to toe, she reached out to him and ran her finger seductively under his chin lifting his head and forcing him to look her in the eye.

�Now's your turn to help me.&nbsp; Do me proud and pay attention.�

He mumbled compliance through his gag and leather muzzle, and broke away from her to attend one of the ponies.&nbsp; Mistress also moved in towards her other pony leaving the gathered spectators to watch from the rope blocking the stall entrances.&nbsp; She steeped past her pony ducking under one of his lead ropes, and went straight to the bag.&nbsp; 

Returning with more items from the bag under her arm, she took the hand of her pony and gently held it in hers.&nbsp; She caressed his fingers and stoked at his palm before softly pushing his fingers into a fist.&nbsp; The pony savoured her kind touches, trusting in her guidance as she slowly slid a rubber hoof over his balled hand.&nbsp; He felt the rubber contract tightly around his wrist as she pulled closed the zipper, his hand now replaced with a perfectly crafted rubber hoof.

She did not drop her feather-light touch as she moved her hand from his new hoof, up his arm and across the back of his shoulders, and back down to his other wrist.&nbsp; Again she played with his fingers and instinctively as she slowed, he balled his hand awaiting his other hoof.&nbsp; She did not disappoint him, securing it in place with the a pull of a zip.

Running her hands across his back he uncontrollably shivered to the delight of the onlookers.&nbsp; She took his new hoofs, and one at a time, she lifted his arms and rested his wrists over his own lead ropes.&nbsp; In a world of sub-space he complied standing as a cross in the middle of his stall.&nbsp; Across in the other stall, Bitch too now had the rubber hoofs on his pony and was force-ably putting him into the cross stance.&nbsp; Once done she motioned to bitch and they switched stalls.&nbsp; Mistress did not want either of her ponies to feel left out, and as this was there first time she wanted to share in both of their experiences.

From the bags now came more hooves, although these were different and more of a knee high leather boot.&nbsp; Mistress started her touch behind his hips and slowly slid her hands down his Lycra clad thighs until she reached his ankles.&nbsp; Hooking a hand around his shin she lightly pulled back, forcing him onto one foot, his cross stance now giving him some balance on the lead ropes tethering him in place.

Calmly she slid his raised foot into the boot, pointing his toes, she slipped the leather up his calf until his toes could go no deeper.&nbsp; He tested his new footwear and planted the hoof sole into the stable floor.&nbsp; Immediately he could feel the fixed angle of his foot in the boot and the minimal surface he had to stand on.&nbsp; Wobbling about he still held most of his weight on his bare foot as she moved around in front of him.&nbsp; Working from the toe up, Mistress pulled and tightened the lacing to her liking, making sure that he had no movement within the boot and the maximum amount of support possible.&nbsp; Once at the top she finished off with a neat bow and stroked at his leg, encouraging him to put his weight down on it.

This time he felt more stable in his new hoof, feeling the support of the tight thick leather around his lower leg and ankle.&nbsp; Content with her work, Mistress went about giving this pony his last hoof.&nbsp; 

Bitch was working on the other pony but in a much more brutal way.&nbsp; The pup unable to convey the same tenderness for the pony as their Mistress was, instead relying on forcing consent from the pony he now envied.

It didn't take long to get them both shod, and Mistress had decided to let them be free to feel their new hooves within the confines of the stalls.&nbsp; She had unhooked for each of them one of the lead ropes, and now they walked about still tethered to one wall, but able get a feel for the new footwear.&nbsp; Mistress had sent Bitch to start preparing the next items of tack for the ponies and she stood with the passing crowd, chatting with them and answering questions.

It was not long before Bitch had laid out an array of leather strapping and other equestrian looking items on the ground within the stalls.&nbsp; The ponies had been walking about, getting used to the feel of the high stance hoof boots they now wore, and the crowd was still cycling past.&nbsp; Everything was following her plans perfectly, all of her submissives were responding as she expected.

Once Bitch was happy with the equipment he had arranged for Mistress, he ran back to her and knelt by her feet.&nbsp; She was busy talking to some people about past sessions with her pets, and ignored Bitch until she had finished her story.&nbsp; 

She looked down to him, �Good boy,� with a comforting hand stroking against his muzzle, she continued, �I have to go for a little bit and see some people at the stage.&nbsp; I'll be back soon.&nbsp; I want you to tend to the ponies and wrap up their ankles.�&nbsp; Finishing, she lent in close and gave him a subtle kiss to his leather muzzle.

He watched her cut through the crowd and vanish into the masses of the fair.&nbsp; Light headed and full of lust, her words took a little to soak in, but he turned and went back to tend the ponies.&nbsp; He re-attached both lead ropes to each of the pony's bits, took some snow white bandages, and knelt at the the foot of a pony and started the job of wrapping their ankles.

Mistress cut a line directly to the stage in the main arena.&nbsp; On the main stage there was a lecture going on, demonstrating some simple rope binding techniques.&nbsp; The lecturer, a large bearded gentleman in leather pants and vest was showing the different ties and their uses on his five willing volunteers.&nbsp; He had been doing his demonstration for some time now as all of his subjects were bound in varying states of immobilisation.&nbsp; While he was working on an intricate rear arm bind, he explained what he was doing through his microphone and a camera man buzzed about shooting close ups that were being fed live onto the two big screens behind them.&nbsp; 

Cutting around the stage side Mistress found the event organiser she was looking for.&nbsp; �Good morning Madam Que, how lovely to see you once more,� Mistress said to the opulently dressed woman.&nbsp; Madam Que turned to her addresser, her ruby red burlesque dress swishing around with her graceful movements, it hugged her fine yet curvy body and mimicked her every move.&nbsp; 
�Oh my god, you look amazing.&nbsp; You really should wear rubber more often, you do it so well.�
�Oh please Madam, like you haven't seen me like this before.�&nbsp; She grinned, the compliment well received.&nbsp; 
�And what may I do for you on this fine day?&nbsp; How are your little ponies going?� Madam asked.
�Oh the ponies are magnificent, only halfway there, but they are coming along perfectly.&nbsp; I just came to see how you are and that everything is in order.&nbsp; My ponies should be ready within the hour.�
�Don't fret, the competition will begin shortly, but I shan&#8217;t forget your entry.&nbsp; Even if you are a little behind, I promise they wont miss out,� Madam reassured her with a heartfelt smile.
�Thank you Madam, I know they will work hard for your cause this afternoon.�
�I hope so, you're taking up valuable real-estate in the stables.&nbsp; I had quite a few people wanting to set up in there.�
�You won't be disappointed.� Mistress replied.&nbsp; She took the Madams hand, giving it a tender kiss, one of a long-time friendship.

Mistress took her leave, turning to find her way through the masses and back to her stables.&nbsp; �SLOWER, I want to see that arse working.� Madam called out to her over the sounds of the fair.&nbsp; A cheeky smile of thanks and embarrassment exploding across her face, as she slowed a little and let her hips show her wears through the latex catsuit.

She did not go straight back to the stables, instead doing a lap of the fair looking for a treat for Bitch.&nbsp; As she approached the stables, the crowd had broken down to a few onlookers.&nbsp; Bitch was sitting by the entrance, leaning on the stall divider.&nbsp; Taking note of her two ponies, both were now adorned with pure white bandages neatly wound around their forearms and lower legs.&nbsp; 

�Good Bitch,�&nbsp; He sat up straight at her praise.&nbsp; �I have a treat for you.�&nbsp; She walked passed him and motioned him to follow.&nbsp; She lead her pup around the side of the stables to where she had set up his water bowl.&nbsp; Releasing the straps holding his leather muzzle she gently pulled it from his chin, the fixed rubber gag escaping his mouth.&nbsp; He flexed his jaw, enjoying his moment of freedom and regaining some of the lost feelings.

She motioned to the water bowl on the ground and he quickly took his order.&nbsp; Lapping at the cool refreshment he savoured its blandness, as he knew to be thankful for the little things she gave.&nbsp; As he sat back up, knowing that he would have to wait until she was ready to let him drink again, she surprised him and held her clenched fist out to him.&nbsp; �Now sit pretty.�&nbsp; Kneeling, he then sat back onto his legs and brought his hands up in front of his chest and begged.&nbsp; 
�Come on, you can do better, I know you can,� she taunted.&nbsp; He pulled his chin in tight, puffed his chest and straightened his back.&nbsp; She stood there looking at him, her 'not impressed look' clearly plastered across her face.&nbsp; Bitch held the stance, his back beginning to ache, he tilted his head and went for the full puppy eyes look.&nbsp; It did not take long.&nbsp; �Awww, you are so cute.&nbsp; Good boy,� she lent in a gave him the treat.&nbsp; Holding it tight, she then let him sniff it before gently pushing it into his waiting mouth.&nbsp; He sucked the small chocolate treat she gave him and rolled it about in his mouth for a few seconds before chewing it and scoffing it down.&nbsp; Immediately he gave her the puppy eyes again.&nbsp; �No, you only get one, chocolate isn't good for dogs.�&nbsp; 

He whimpered and bent down to his water bowl, having another drink to wash down the treat.&nbsp; As his head came back up she slipped a hand around his head and pushed the muzzle and gag back onto his face.&nbsp; Bitch sat still as she pushed his head around tightening the straps to her liking.&nbsp; Once Mistress was content that he was secured properly she motioned him to follow and walked back around to the ponies.

Both of the ponies stood in the centre of their stalls, the ropes doing their job keeping them calm and steady.&nbsp; Two sets of ponies eyes now tracked her movements as she walked back and forth across the stalls, Mistress enjoying their black forms and obedient nature.&nbsp; Stepping into one stall, she motioned to Bitch to enter the other.&nbsp; Both ponies began to fidget about with anticipation of what was to come, whatever that was going to be. 

She walked up to her pony and calmed him with some loving strokes down his nose.&nbsp; She then slipped under the lead rope, leaving his vision, to the pony tack set up behind him.&nbsp; Picking up the first of many parts she unceremoniously started strapping him up in the custom made harness.&nbsp; In the next stall, Bitch watched her carefully and followed suit with the pony he had been assigned.

First was the leather waist belt, it was five inches wide with two heavy buckles at the back and was adorned with D-rings and cart tugs to each side.&nbsp; At the front there were two empty buckles pointing down to his crotch, at the rear was a long shiny black tail, made of real horse hair, pointing straight out from the harness and hanging down below his knees.&nbsp; Two straps also hung down from just beneath his tail. To make sure she had it tight enough, she gave her pony an unexpected poke to the belly, making him breath in as she tightened the buckles at the back.&nbsp; Moving in front of her pony, she reached between his legs grabbing one of the small straps.&nbsp; With no care for his excited member, she pulled the crotch strap through and feed it to one of the empty buckles at the front of his girth belt.&nbsp; The second was also pulled though, although she deliberately left both of them slack.

Next she strapped a three inch strap around each upper thigh, these were a little loose and held in place with a short strap running down the outer thigh from the main belt.&nbsp; The pony could sense them move around as he changed his stance but not drop any further on his thighs, the feeling of the straps on his inner thighs heightening his excitement.

Mistress went to the divider and checked on Bitch, she had shown him the gear and explained it before the ponies had arrived at the stables.&nbsp; With such short tuition, she was very happy with the work he was doing and had managed to copy her perfectly.&nbsp; If he kept this up, she knew he would be up for a very special treat.&nbsp; As he finished off the leg straps she motioned him to sit back in the stall and wait, she wanted to do the next part herself.

Turning back to her own pony she could see he was getting stirred up with excitement.&nbsp; She picked up the upper part of the harness and brought it around to show him.&nbsp; It was made with layers of think leather, giving both strength and weight to it's construction.&nbsp; The upper harness was shaped to sit across the chest of the pony, then up and over the shoulders and covering between the shoulder blades..&nbsp; There were short straps that held it in place under his arms and also two down the front and the same down the back, joining it to the main belt.&nbsp; 

With the upper harness in one hand she unhooked each of the lead ropes holding him in place, now it was little more than his desire to please and be hers that kept him in place.&nbsp; Holding the harness before him, she pointed out the steel plate riveted to the front.&nbsp; Looking through his darkened pony eyes he could see the plate but not what was on it.&nbsp; He tilted his head and turned his face, trying to get a look at what she wanted to show him. 

�This is your special new name, it took me a while, but I found what I think is the right name for you.&nbsp; You are now, Prancer.�&nbsp; 

Lovingly she stroked at the side of his neck for a moment before placing her hand on the end of his nose, pushing it up to make it easier to pass the harness over his head.&nbsp; He let her guiding touches control his movement as she slotted the upper harness over his head and set it gently on his shoulders.&nbsp; She did each of the straps under his arms then after connecting each of the front and rear straps, she began to tightening them.&nbsp; Holding nothing back, she made sure all of them were as snug as possible against his body, but still allowing natural movement.&nbsp; As she pulled them tight Prancer could fell the girth belt being pulled up slightly with the tension.&nbsp; 

Once she was happy with the main harness she turned her attentions to the loose crotch straps.&nbsp; With one hand she grabbed his hidden member, making sure he was clear and then tightened the crotch straps as far as she could, reversing the tensions on the girth belt and firming the full harness to his entire body.

Prancer was in the world of bliss, his body being compressed in comfortable ways, giving him feelings of satisfaction no matter how he moved.&nbsp; His hoofs becoming more familiar with every passing minute, and his harness a welcome confinement to his adrenaline filled body.&nbsp; His entire body now screamed in his mind that he was a pony, nothing more and nothing less, he was her property and he would do anything she desired.&nbsp; 

Mistress poked fingers in and around his harness, making sure that all was straight, tidy and well fitted.&nbsp; Her pony was just that, her creation, and she want him to be the best he could be, she knew he would give her nothing less than everything he has.&nbsp; Once satisfied with him, she stroked his body one last time before re-attaching his lead ropes and leaving him to explore his new found arousal. 

She returned to the other stall and found Bitch had been watching from the ground through a gap in the divider.&nbsp; He sat to attention, but even through his leather chastity shorts she could see his jealous erection trying to burst out.&nbsp; She gave him a pat on the head and lent in close, �You will get your day someday too.&nbsp; Now go tend to Prancer, I want him with his arm binders on and ready to have the blinkers to go on.�&nbsp; Wishing it were him, he stood and walked to the other stall, his rubber tail betraying his actual mood of jealousy as it wagged happily about with each movement.

Turning her attention to her other pony, Mistress followed the same steps.&nbsp; With his pony mask and the lead ropes he had been unable to see what had been happening in the other stall.&nbsp; He had just enjoyed the first half of his harness being put on by Bitch and was still getting use to it when mistress began the second half.

She now held his upper harness in her hand and released his lead ropes, again she held up the riveted plate for him to try and read.&nbsp; �Just like my other pony, you too are very special to me, so I had to think long and hard for the right name.&nbsp; You are now known as Dancer.�&nbsp; With that she gave him tender touch across his soon to be covered chest and then tilted his head back to put on the remainder of his harness.&nbsp; 

After finishing off and tightening all the straps of his now complete harness, she took a step back and watched as he came to terms with the arousal of his new attire.&nbsp; Even though his human face was covered, it was obvious to anyone watching his body language, he could not have been any happier.

A short time later Mistress had also bound him up with his arm binders to match Prancer's.&nbsp; It consisted of three 2 inch heavy leather straps up each arm, one at the wrist and one each side of the elbow and then attached together with double ended clasps, locking their arms uselessly behind them.&nbsp; It also had the wonderful effect of forcing them to push out their chests, showing off their fit and bound bodies.

With only one part left until her ponies were complete, Mistress and Bitch worked together on each of the ponies.&nbsp; First they put a posture collar on each of the ponies, then the head strap holding the blinkers that went up and over their heads.&nbsp; Finally, they attached a tall elegant feather to the back of the collar that stood tall above the pony's head, reminiscent of the heavy haulage horses of days gone by.

Once finished with them, Mistress, with Bitch kneeling at her feet, stood back amongst the standing crowd and admired her creations.&nbsp; They were just as she had envisioned them, and they had both been extremely patient with her plans.&nbsp; Unable to stand still each of them fidgeted within their confines, testing and feeling the transformation they had been put through, loving every second.

Checking the time Mistress had made her deadline by a considerable amount, no longer did she worry about making the stage on time.&nbsp; She enjoyed her moment watching them, as her hand instinctively found its way to Bitch's head by her side and stroked him with her delight.&nbsp; It had now just passed the stroke of midday, and she and her pets had a long afternoon ahead of them.

She moved away from Bitch leaving him sitting with the crowd and unhooked the guide ropes blocking the front of the stalls.&nbsp; Dropping them to the ground, she then slowly approached Prancer, her hands calming his bound body as she stroked her pony, stealing any anxiety from him.&nbsp; Unhooking one lead rope from the wall she held it tightly in hand and unhooked the other from his pony bit, letting it drop unceremoniously to the floor.&nbsp; With her control complete she gave a tug to his lead rope, he dropped his nose slightly and moved towards her.&nbsp; Smiling, she gave another tug and walked him from the stall.&nbsp; 

Unsteady on his hoofs and with no arms for balance he was far from graceful, but in time he would learn.&nbsp; She took him out into the crowd, they moved apart allowing the pony space as he walked about in the sunlight.&nbsp; With limited vision from his pony mask and blinkers, Prancer could only see glimpses of who was around him, he just trusted in the weight and guidance of the lead rope transmitting his Mistress's wishes through his mouth bit.

They all enjoyed watching as this new pony-boy was born, unsteady and lacking in confidence, he was still beautiful to behold.&nbsp; His muscles twitching and flexing under his tight black bodysuit, contorting and fighting against his rigid harness.&nbsp; His legs taught from walking on his toes, toning his finely round rump, uncomfortably hiding under his long black tail.&nbsp; He stood tall amongst the onlookers, the hoof boots and forced posture putting him a head above most.

After two short circles on the spot she stopped him in front of Bitch still sitting on the ground, wishing it were him on the lead rope.&nbsp; She motioned him up and then to the surprise of everyone around, she handed him the rope.&nbsp; 

Mistress, happy knowing that Bitch knew his role, she went and took Dancer from his stall.&nbsp; As she lead her second pony out into the sunlight, Bitch offered the lead back to her.&nbsp; She smiled and winked to him, letting him take control of Prancer.&nbsp; She pulled Dancer next to Prancer and the two ponies formally meet.&nbsp; They both tried to get a closer look of each other, although extremely limited by the pony gear they now endured.&nbsp; Side by side, they stood for the onlookers, several people taking photos of the two of them.

Mistress turned to Bitch and whispered to him, �I think we shall take the long way around.�

Falling into step with his Mistress, both of them gave a little tug to the ponies and the four of them proceeded into the fair.&nbsp; Mistress and her pup servant walking in front, her perfectly presented pony-boys being led behind.&nbsp; 

As they walked the path around the track, they found heads turning in their direction from all walks of the community.&nbsp; It was not anything new, but the presentation is what sold them.&nbsp; Two fresh entirely matching pony-boys, a pup submissive entrusted to his Mistress, and Mistress herself, one of the finest figures of the day, framed perfectly, encased in her hand crafted latex outfit.

The crowd parted wherever they moved, some took photos, others fired compliments or questions to Mistress, but everywhere they went they were followed by the sound of pony hoofs, pattering on the path.&nbsp; As they passed by the cage holding area, the incarcerated all took note of them, a look of jealousy uniform amongst them.

Mistress and her entourage sauntered their way in the midday sunshine around the welcoming fair settings.&nbsp; Everyone they encountered were encouraging and positive, many just wishing they could be a part of their little display.

As they almost completed the full circuit of the equestrian track, Mistress changed direction and turned into the main arena.&nbsp; The two ponies, having just come to terms with walking in hoof on the path now found trouble with the soft lush grass they had to cross to the stage.&nbsp; As they hesitated and struggle to maintain balance, Mistress slowed and let them follow her at their own pace.&nbsp; Undeterred and wanting to please they did not stop but grateful for the caution they could now afford.

Up on the stage, Madam Que had the Floor and was presenting a fetish fashion show.&nbsp; She floated about on stage talking into her Microphone about each of the entrants, her red dress leaving the audience no mistake who was in charge.&nbsp; She spoke with wisdom only earned through years of dedicated knowledge and a passion unrivalled by anyone.&nbsp; She currently discussed the finer parts of one entrant's leather crafted dominatrix catsuit to the masses on the lawn below.&nbsp; 

Mistress half watching the stage and also being mindful of her ponies, continued their journey around to the rear of the stage.&nbsp; As the troupe reached the stairs up onto the stage she halted them.&nbsp; Handing Dancer's lead rope to Bitch, she gave each of her ponies a going over, correcting their gear and making sure that perfection was in order.&nbsp; �Wait here,� she ordered Bitch, as she turned and ascended the stairs to the wing of the stage.&nbsp; She watched Madam Que strutting around her current subject, passionate words flowing from her to the entertainment of the audience.&nbsp; 

Caught in the corner of Madam's eye she spotted her Mistress friend watching from the safety of the curtain.&nbsp; Finishing off her spiel of the costume she was displaying, she politely ended that presentation and put an arm out to Mistress.

�And now, just in the nick of time, I would like to introduce you all to a close personal friend of mine.�&nbsp; She motioned Mistress up to her on the stage.&nbsp; Without so much as a moment of hesitation, Mistress strode out onto the stage, her boots echoing on the wooden stage floor.&nbsp; She gave Madam Que a loving hug followed by a kiss to each of her cheeks.

�This is Miss Gray, I have know her for a long time, and must I say, you look radiant today.�&nbsp; Holding the Microphone out to Mistress she responded, �Thank you Madam Que, but only as you continue to set the standards so high for the rest of us.�

�Flattery will get you Everywhere.&nbsp; Now tell us a little about your wonderful outfit.�

As Mistress spoke about the finer details of her custom made equestrian inspired outfit, a discreet cameraman buzzed around her like hummingbird, highlighting her comments on the big screens behind them.&nbsp; Madam Que continued to encourage her to elaborate further at every opportunity, but Mistress tried in vain to keep it short and simple, she was not expecting to become the center of attention.

Knowing that Mistress was trying to politely move the attention from herself, Madam Que gave in to the battle of wits with her friend and asked, �Now your not here for yourself today, are you?�

�No Madam Que, today I have brought my special pets for your fashion show.�&nbsp; 

�Such a stunning outfit and you don't want to share more?�

�I'm honoured but my pets are probably getting restless backstage.�

�Well, why don't you go fetch them for us all to take a look at them,� she offered with a smile.

As Mistress smiled back to Madam, she turned and went back to her ponies behind the stage.&nbsp; Bitch greeted her with the best look he could muster within the tight confines of his leather muzzle.&nbsp; She took both lead ropes from him, and motioned him to sit.&nbsp; As he dropped down to his knees pulling off the best puppy sit he could, she broke the news he did not want to hear.&nbsp; �No Bitch.&nbsp; Stay.&nbsp; Your day will come another time.�&nbsp; She stroked him under him under his chin, a meaningful gesture, but not the one he desired.

Turning to her ponies she made a clicking sound with her tongue and lead them up the stairs, onto the stage.&nbsp; Both of them struggled judging the steps but she did not give them time to think about it, she just tugged their lead ropes and pulled them up by the mouth.&nbsp; As she crossed the stage the sound of her boots eclipsed by the wondrous sound of pony hoofs as they clopped behind her.&nbsp; She took them both to center stage and positioned them side by side so everyone could see them in all their glory.

�My goodness Miss Gray, where does one find such beautiful stallions?�

�One must look long and hard, I know, it has taken me a while.&nbsp; I would like to introduce to you Dancer and Prancer, my two new ponies.&nbsp; I expect they may be a little unsure of this as it is their first time out, but they are both behaving well.�

Madam Que turned her attention back to the audience.&nbsp; �Is she not the luckiest Mistress here today?&nbsp; Now how about you tell us what it has taken for you to bring these wonderful beasts before us today.�&nbsp; Madam Que then passed the microphone to Mistress and encouraged her to give a detailed explanation of her ponies attire.

As she spoke both ponies were stunned in the moment, they were now in full view of everyone in attendance, there was no greater way to be the spectacle of the fair.&nbsp; Each of them felt every pair of eyes bearing down on them, soaking in every detail of their bodies and admiring the costumes that Mistress had provided them.&nbsp; It was not any fault of their own, but the excitement and feelings gradually got the better of them with each of them feeling the strict confinement of the harness around their groins.&nbsp; As they stood on display, each locked within their own leather bliss, Mistress continued to highlight special touches built into their new personas, followed closely by the cameraman giving close up shots for the benefit of the big screens.

Feeling the attention bearing down, each of them began to fidget within there personal confines tensing their arms within the binders and shuffling about on their hoofs.&nbsp; Mistress turned Prancer around as he started to fight against his arm bindings, discreetly stroking him and calming his anxiety, all the while turning it into a demonstration of his pony tail and tight rump.&nbsp; She made sure that the cameraman took great advantage of his posterior getting it perfectly framed for the big screen.&nbsp; With a playful pat to his rump she turned to Madam Que and handed her Prancer's lead rope, moving him to the side of the stage.&nbsp; 

Standing closely in front of Dancer, she drew his attention from the hundreds of eyes looking over his body to his desire to serve his Mistress.&nbsp; She notice his breathing slow down as his mind shut out the fair, the gear, and the rest of the world.&nbsp; To him it was now only his Mistress and his need to please her.&nbsp; He watched her through the narrow vision he was trapped with, looking for any sign of an order.&nbsp; She pulled straight down on his rope, pulling his head and mouth down towards his chest.&nbsp; As he conformed it also brought the effect of making his posture change ever so slightly, lifting his shoulders and making him take a more majestic stance.&nbsp; She stroked his chin in reward, letting him know to hold that pose for her.&nbsp; 

Clicking her tongue at him, she moved to one side and tugged on his rope, the gentle force felt in full through his mouth bit.&nbsp; He followed and as he took his first step she tapped him on the thigh, instinctively he lifted it higher before finishing his step.&nbsp; As he took another step again she tapped him again, and he stepped much higher than normal.&nbsp; By the third step he had worked it out for himself, making sure to lift his knee to horizontal before placing it back down, all the while trying to maintain the stance she had requested of him.&nbsp; 

She took him back and forth across the stage while explaining to their audience how he was still in training, and would only improve from what they saw today.&nbsp; For him his concentration was being stretched further than it ever had before.&nbsp; Holding the pose while taking the steps she required, he fought hard for balance on his new hoofs, with his only means of guidance the gentle tugging he felt through his mouth.&nbsp; His confidence grew with each lap of the stage, and he found himself slipping into a comfortable rhythm.&nbsp; 

�Whooowwww,� she called, as she pulled his rope down, breaking his stride.&nbsp; She pushed him to a standstill with a hand to his chest steadying the pony still ready for more work.&nbsp; Dancer's heartbeat thumping it's way through his chest, through the harness and right into his Mistress's hand.&nbsp;&nbsp; She smiled at the thought of the effort he had put in even if it was just a short jaunt, as it was something she had never asked of him before.

Turning back to Madam Que, Mistress passed her back the microphone as she took Prancer's lead rope back.

�Thank you for that display Miss Gray, please, everyone show your appreciation.� she announced, encouraging a round of applause for the Mistress and her fresh ponies.&nbsp; �I believe you will all have a chance to get up and close to the ponies throughout they day, please show them your support and make sure you visit them at sometime during the afternoon.�

With the applause washing over the stage, Mistress took a bow to acknowledge the crowd before leading her pets back off the stage.&nbsp; She took it slow down the stairs, giving the ponies all the time they needed to comfortably navigate the tricky obstacle.&nbsp; At the bottom Bitch waited, still with a disgruntled look etched into his face.&nbsp; Mistress fired a displeased look back at him as she handed him Dancer's lead.&nbsp; 

Strategically she took her troupe around the stage and back amongst the crowd she had just entranced.&nbsp; She lead the way, enjoying the warmth of their attention as her pets focused on being all they could in their reflection of her.&nbsp; It was a meandering path she took back to the stables, stopping for anyone that wanted a closer look at her equine playthings.&nbsp; Both Prancer and Dancer had slipped well into their new identities.&nbsp; At first they had been timid in their movements, restrained in unfamiliarity, but now having had some time in their new gear, and with an overwhelming positive response from everyone around them, they found their inner ponies.&nbsp; Moving with a ponies grace and inquisitiveness, they interacted with their admirers with tenderness and an equal amount of respect.&nbsp; Mistress could not have been happier with them, she had let them find their own way inside the mask and within their own heads, she had just given them the little push they needed.&nbsp; She now found she was enjoying watching them and their interactions, and knew they were ready for the next challenge.

Eventually they finished the journey back to the stables, and Mistress watched as Bitch used the lead ropes to restrain them back in their stalls.&nbsp; Once each of them were settled back, she motioned her pup to her feet and stroked him under his chin.&nbsp; �You are doing very well my dear.&nbsp; Your time to be the center of my attention will come, and you will know it.&nbsp; Until then I need you focus on what I want from you, not what they are doing.&nbsp; Do you understand?�&nbsp; Eyes down trodden he reluctantly nodded, his immediate wants overridden by his desires for her.&nbsp; Slipping her thumb up onto his cheek her loving touch drew the last of his stubbornness from him, a stubbornness that she had always found endearing in her pet.

Having obtained her pups full attention she now gave him his most important job of the day.&nbsp; She was leaving him to tend to the ponies on his own, to feed them, to adjust their attire and give them a moment away from public eyes.&nbsp; Mistress on the other hand was due for a little renewal of her own, she had been invited to a VIP luncheon within the fair, and as much as it pained her to leave her ponies, she still had full control through her pup.&nbsp; She continued to stroke him as she explicitly&nbsp; detailed everything that she wanted him to do, and in what order.&nbsp; Once finished she lent close to him, kissing him on the forehead, before motioning him to the stables and to begin his tasks.&nbsp; As he disappeared under the curtain she turned to seek out Madam Que and her luncheon date.

Bitch worked hard behind the curtain, he took his responsibilities as law, he followed her word to the letter.&nbsp; He tended the ponies, giving them time out of their masks, but only so they could eat a prepared equine themed meal, and only one at a time, denying them the chance to see each outside of their full pony outfit.&nbsp; He then took their hoof boots from them, exchanging them for more conventional black military style boots.&nbsp; Each of them appreciative of the comfortable footwear, but sad at the lose of their unique pony hoofs.&nbsp; Bitch timed his tasks well finishing just as his allotted time ran out, he quickly went over what he could, making sure all was in order for their Mistress's return.&nbsp; He then found himself a comfortable spot in the hay, and settled himself down until her return.

It took longer than expected and the ponies were getting restless in their stalls, but eventually Mistress returned calling to Bitch from outside the curtain.&nbsp; He scrambled to her call, and ducked under the curtain only to be stopped in his tracks with her new outfit.&nbsp; Gone was her glossy black catsuit, now she worn more traditional equestrian attire.&nbsp; Light tan jodhpurs now hugged her legs above her english riding boots, displaying her curves just as the latex had.&nbsp; Above she still wore her riding vest looking corset, but now it sat tightly above a light blue silk shirt cut specificity for her.&nbsp; She smiled and motioned him to her feet, reaching down she picked the pieces of hay from his back from where he had been laying.

Once content that he was at his best once more she asked if he had finished his tasks.&nbsp; With a wag of his tail, and nosing his muzzle at her leg he did he best to acknowledge he was done.&nbsp; �Good boy, we shall see in a moment, now I want to&nbsp; come with me.�&nbsp; She hooked a leash to his collar and let him stand beside her, before leading him off to get the pony cart.

The cart wasn't quite full size, but it had been designed with two human ponies in mind.&nbsp; It was relatively basic having only two wheels and a single bench seat between them.&nbsp; The simple aluminium frame had been coated in black, highlighting the wooden spoked wheels and black leather bench seat for two. From under the seat came the pole which ended with a crossbar for attaching the ponies.&nbsp; As Bitch dragged the cart around in front of the stables people began to gather at the new apparatus as it was put on display.&nbsp; Following Mistress's direction he positioned it at her whim and started laying out the tack for each of the ponies.

Her excitement getting the better of her, she turned back to the curtain, and her ponies concealed behind it.&nbsp; She drew back the concealment, giving them their first look at their afternoon task.&nbsp; She watched over them as they strained themselves to take in every detail through their restrictive leather masks.&nbsp; Their body language one of excitement and eagerness, as the wriggled about against their ropes and bonds, wanting to get started.&nbsp; She walked in to Dancer stroking at his chest and whispered in his ear �Are you ready to work?&nbsp; A pony has to earn his way, we can't have you getting all lazy now, can we?�&nbsp; With her other hand she unhooked one of the lead ropes and let it drop to the floor.&nbsp; Holding a hand out behind her, Bitch took the initiative and passed her a set of reins.&nbsp; Clipping it to Dancer's mouth bit, she replaced the other lead rope and gave the reins a little tug to make sure he was still paying attention.&nbsp; Responding with a head bob, his gaze stayed transfixed on the cart.&nbsp; 

Giving an encouraging click with her mouth she tugged on his reins and walked him out into the sunlight.&nbsp; With a little shoving she had him positioned, Bitch lifted the cart pole up to Dancer's waist, and Mistress set about hooking him up.&nbsp; She attached a short chain from the cart pole to his left hip, then a long chain from the end of the crossbar to his right hip and tautly back to the cart itself.&nbsp; Motioning to Bitch, he let go of the cart, allowing the pony feel the cart's weight through his leather harness.&nbsp; It was a well balanced cart and sat well bound to his hips, his leather harness letting out a little squeak of strain but spreading the light load evenly and comfortably upon his body.

Turning her attention to Prancer, Mistress grabbed another set of reins.&nbsp; As she approached he tried to move forward stopped abruptly by his ropes.&nbsp; She tried to settled him with a few strokes, but she could feel his excitement and desire bursting from his body.&nbsp; �Calm, just calm a little, you aren't going to miss out.�&nbsp; She took his leather nose and mouth in her hand and forced him to look her face to face.&nbsp; �Calm, it's going to be a long afternoon.�&nbsp; As his breathing slowed back to normal, she pulled his nose closer and gave him a kiss between his pony eyes.&nbsp; �Good boy,� she whispered to him.&nbsp; Swapping his ropes for the reins, she then gave him the same treatment as Dance and lead him out into the sunshine and next to his pony brother.

A few chains locked in place and he too was bonded to the cart and his brother.&nbsp; They were now truly a team, joined at the hip and at her disposal.&nbsp; The admirers took photo's and commented on their matching tack, the ponies left with nothing to do yet but stand and take the attention.&nbsp; 

Mistress took the sulky Bitch to one side and whispered words of encouragement in his ear. For now he had pleased her with his ability to follow her instructions, but the time had come that he would not be needed for a while.&nbsp; She gave him loving words of the times to come and the pleasure she had already received from him.&nbsp; As he found his inner peace and relaxed to her silky voice, he gave up his jealousy and awaited his next task.&nbsp; She took his padded mitts and he offered his paws to her, once more she locked away his fingers and left him dependent on her.&nbsp; Finally taking his chain lead she feed it around the post separating the stalls and clasped it to his collar, leaving him with a shaded cool spot to sit out the afternoon.&nbsp; With one last pat on his head she turned to her ponies.&nbsp; Bitch watched her go, then circled the immediate ground once before dropping down onto his side, a comfortable spot to watch the proceedings before him. 

Her ponies becoming restless as she walked in front of each of them, straightening and perfecting their tack for their afternoon work.&nbsp; Focused on her task she never noticed Madam Que as she approached from behind.&nbsp; �Hello again beautiful,� She quipped, making her presence felt.
�Madam Que, how wonderful for you to join me,� Mistress replied with a smile.
�With the effort you have gone to I wouldn't miss it.�
�It would be an honour if you would join me for my ponies maiden journey.�
�The honour is all mine.� she replied, her voice one of genuine respect for her friend.

A guiding hand lead Madam Que to her place on the soft leather seat.&nbsp; With the grace that only a true lady possesses she sat back on the cart, her movements gently rocking the ponies as they waited.&nbsp; Once settled into the padded bench seat Madam Que looked up to the ponies strapped to the cart.&nbsp; �Oh my, I do like the view,� she said beaming a smile to her friend.&nbsp; Passing the reins back over each of the ponies heads, she took her seat on the bench next to Madam Que.&nbsp; �Yes it is quite nice, I think I could get used to this.�

She pulled in the reins taking up the slack and gaining some pressure on the ponies noses.&nbsp; They felt the pressure evenly on their masks and the bits still comfortably invading their mouths.&nbsp; That little tug was enough to focus them, their time had come, this is what their Mistress wanted from them.&nbsp; Both were now in the same bind, they felt bonded to each other, the bound arms, the weight of the harnesses, the restrictions forcing them into the ponies that she wanted them to be, all lead to them falling away from the world to the simplest animalistic impulses.&nbsp; Although they had not been in this position before, they had dreamt of it, and now it came naturally, all they did was release themselves and let it happen.

Sounding a click to them she also flicked the reins, giving them each a slap to their shoulders.&nbsp; Without a thought they each lent into their harnesses, applying the pressure and pushing forward.&nbsp; Pleasantly surprised the cart moved with less effort than they were expecting.&nbsp; It took the ponies only a few tentative steps before they dropped into a synchronised rhythm together as if they were one.

The crowd parted way giving the ponies right of way, as they moved onto the circular path around the arena.&nbsp; With a tug on the reins they turned and fell true to the center of the path.&nbsp; Mistress watched them intently, being sure they were safe and following her orders.&nbsp; She observed the harnesses and their binding making sure all was as it should be for their maiden voyage.&nbsp; 

Madam Que on the other hand was enjoying the show the ponies were performing right in front of them.&nbsp; �Oh my, your two ponies are beautiful, I could honestly watch them from here all day,� she quipped with a cheeky smile plastered across her face.&nbsp; For a moment Mistress was still lost in the moment of tension, she had spent a lot of time and effort to reach this point, and she was now so focused on the task that she found herself engrossed in the details.&nbsp; It was Madam Que's words that broke her free and for a moment she took in the view.

Their black bodies flexing underneath the tight leather harnesses, muscles tightening and relaxing with each step.&nbsp; The sun directly overhead was accentuating their movements, glistening off the lyca bodysuits.&nbsp; She listened to the creaking and moaning of the leather harness intertwined with the clinking of the cart's chains, all the while feeling the pride well within her.&nbsp; She adored their long black tails swishing back and forth with each laboured step, exposing their perk bottoms framed amongst the black leather strapping.&nbsp; She found her eyes drawn to their legs, their efforts purely for her benefit, as the pumped against the ground pulling her and her guest forward.

�Yes.&nbsp; They are beautiful.�&nbsp; She answered, struggling to find the words.&nbsp; Madam Que seeing her friend's happiness, put an arm around her comforting her further.

The crowd was good and parted for the ponies, a few stopping to take photos others giving words of encouragement.&nbsp; As they reached the first bend in the path Mistress gave a little tug on the reins, both ponies feeling her instructions and complied to follow true to the path.&nbsp; Herself falling for the rhythm of the pony's movements, Mistress felt herself relax into her seat and the comforting touch of her close friend.&nbsp; Together they rode in silence, enjoying the sights, enjoying their company, and loving the view before them.

It didn't take long to complete a full circuit of the fare, Mistress doing her best to regulate the speed of the ponies and to take the longest route possible.&nbsp; But inevitably the maiden journey had to come to an end.&nbsp; Pulling in front of the stables from where they started, Mistress pulled back on the reins and halted the ponies.&nbsp; Jumping from the cart she moved around in front so the ponies could see her, then she have&nbsp; each of them a pat for their efforts.&nbsp; She placed a loving hand on each of their chest feeling their breathing and heartbeat.&nbsp; She could tell they had been working but they each still had a lot more to give her.

Returning to her passenger, she helped Madam Que from her seat.&nbsp; With a wealth of grace she disembarked and hugged her close friend.&nbsp; �Thank you, for letting me share in your dream.&nbsp; You are one very lucky lady to have such wonderful pets.�&nbsp; The embrace broke with a kiss to the cheek and Madam Que stood back to take in another look of the ponies.&nbsp; Joined by Mistress they took a moment to enjoy the black ponies who only hours earlier had been little more than two shy guys responding to the call of their Mistress.

Her eyes drifted over their bodies, taking in the formality of their costumes.&nbsp; She noted their limited movements as they responded to the world around them.&nbsp; Instinctively they were already exhibiting equine gestures, as they interacted with people coming close to them to give them a pat or just get a closer look.&nbsp; 

As she watched them her eyes inadvertently fell upon bitch still tied to the stables.&nbsp; He now sat at the full length of his leash and at attention, just as he had been trained.&nbsp; Without giving him a smile she walked around the cart and to his side, his gaze never leaving her.&nbsp; She bent down and patted him on the head.&nbsp; �You can relax now, is there anything you need?�&nbsp; He looked to his water bowl that was out of reach.&nbsp; She smiled and fetched his water bowl, tipping out the stale water and filling it with fresh water from a bottle.&nbsp; Putting it in front of him, she released the gag from his muzzle to let him take his fill.&nbsp; Once finished she locked his gag back in place and he dropped back onto his side to enjoy the shade.&nbsp; Reaching down she gave him a belly rub before leaving him to attend to her stall.&nbsp; 

Uncovering the A framed sign it advertised carts rides around the fare with no fixed cost, just a friendly donation towards the fare.&nbsp; With the sign now proudly displayed, a female couple stepped forward asking to be first paying customers.&nbsp; Mistress guided the two leather clad patrons around the ponies to the cart bench, helping them up to the padded seat.&nbsp; 

Turning to Madam Que, Mistress gave her a friendly hug.&nbsp; �Time to put my pets to work, thank you for your company.�
�You're welcome, and I'll hopefully be seeing you later this afternoon.�
�For sure, I look forward to it,� Mistress replied, breaking the embrace.
�Enjoy your ponies, I wish I could be watching them from that angle for the rest of the day,� She said, winking as she started to move away into the crowd.

Her attention back to the two lovely ladies sitting upon the pony cart, she smiled to them, their attentions half between her and the two black animals in front of them.&nbsp; Reins in hand, she took her place next to them on the leather bench seat.&nbsp; �Are we ready?�&nbsp; 
�Ready, but we aren't in much of a hurry, we can take our time if you like.�
�I'm sure we can accommodate that.�

With a verbal click and a flick of the reins she got the ponies attentions, and had them moving in a flash.&nbsp; It took a few steps but as before they fell into step together and found a happy rhythm.&nbsp; Mistress made sure her customers were comfortable, as the ponies did their work.&nbsp; She found that they didn't need a lot of encouragement or guidance this time around, they just trotted the same course as they had last time.&nbsp; Mistress didn't mind, she still had the control should she need it, but now she really could just sit an enjoy watching their bodies work and muscles flex.&nbsp; 

That was how her perfect afternoon continued, her pets working out of love for her and the community supporting them.&nbsp; After each circuit she checked her ponies and when needed gave the water through a straw.&nbsp; She then lined up the next patrons, all the while collecting donations to be given to the fair.&nbsp; In the shade of the stables, Bitch watched, at times he napped or got some pats from the passer-bys but he still wished he could be one of the ponies pleasing his Mistress.

They worked through the festivities, becoming one of the popular attractions, until the sun drooped low in the sky.&nbsp; With one last circuit Mistress knew her dream afternoon was now at an end.&nbsp; She guided her ponies in front of the stables for the last time, their panting and lax body movements told her all she needed to know.&nbsp; They had given their all, and would push to keep going so long as she wanted them to, but they were exhausted.&nbsp; 

Mistress apologised to the remaining people still wanting to go for a ride, but they understood.&nbsp; The ponies had been working on and off for hours now, and it was time for the fun to end.&nbsp; Mistress patted them each down, letting them know through her touch the love and admiration she had for them and their efforts.

She had been keeping an eye on Bitch all afternoon as they came back to the stable for more patrons, now he slept up against the post he was tied to.&nbsp; She walked over to him, giving him loving pat on his shoulder, awakening him from his light slumber.&nbsp; Motioning him to sit up, he rolled over stretching out in the process before sitting up into the stance she had taught him.&nbsp; Bending down close she tenderly kissed him on the forehead, his eyes closing at her touch.&nbsp; She slid her hand under his chin, holding his head in her kiss before pulling her face back to see his loving eyes as they opened for her.

She gave him one of her most sacred of smiles, one of joyous thanks for his efforts.&nbsp; �You have done well pup, I only need your assistance for a little longer.�&nbsp; She took his paw in her hands and removed his mitt.&nbsp; Stretching out his fingers, she entwined hers with his, taking the any soreness away from his underutilised fingers.&nbsp; Kissing his hand she let go and motioned for his other paw.&nbsp; She repeated the process before removing his gag and letting him drink again.&nbsp; Once he was done she unlocked him from his leash and motioned him up onto his feet.

�I want you to take the ponies into their separate stalls and drop the curtain back in place.&nbsp; Then put the cart away and come to me.�&nbsp; He nodded acknowledgement, then moved to his duties.&nbsp; Mistress covered the ride sign, before leaving to seek out Madam Que.

The cart gone and curtain in place Mistress was happy upon her return.&nbsp; She carried with her a stylish shopping bag that she place on the ground as she passed under the curtain.&nbsp; Her two ponies were back in their positions, roped to the centre of their stall, and Bitch sat in the hey at the back of one stall.

As she entered, all eyes followed her every movement.&nbsp; She passed Prancer running a hand around his torso as she ducked under the guide rope and behind him.&nbsp; �Good boy,� she said to Bitch giving him pat on the head, �Stay�.&nbsp; Moving up behind Prancer she put her hands on his hips and moved her body in close.&nbsp; Pressing herself against him, she could feel his bound arms against her front and his tail pressing into her.&nbsp; Wrapping her arms around his black and bound body she radiated her love for his submission to him.&nbsp; �You have made me proud, more so than you can imagine.&nbsp; You have done well and it will not be forgotten,� she whispered through his leather mask.&nbsp; Unable to respond to her with his own touch he gave a whimper of his own, muffled by the bit gag and the leather mask still changing his identity.

Hearing this she let go and moved under his guide rope to face him directly.&nbsp; Stepping in close she reached around his head to the buckles holding his head secure.&nbsp; She knew he was intently looking at her up close but with the black lens of the pony mask she could only hear his breath underneath.&nbsp; Slowly but methodically she unbuckled his mask, holding it in place with her free hand as she released the last clasp.&nbsp; Stepping back one step she still held the mask to his face but now with both hands, as if she were holding his cheeks.

�You are so beautiful, I wish I could have you like this forever.�

Dropping her arms she took the mask from his face, the internal bit gag freeing itself from his mouth.&nbsp; His eyes transfixed to hers, his face covered in well earned sweat as he stretched his jaw and mouth.&nbsp; It took a moment for him to find his voice, but eventually it came to him.&nbsp; �Thank you Mistress.&nbsp; Thank you for everything,� his own voice sounding foreign to himself.&nbsp; She smiled, and found the words she was looking for, �You're welcome.�

Leaving Prancers mask to hang in front of him by the guide ropes she gently pulled his head forward and kissed him on the forehead.&nbsp; She left him standing his head bowed and took her attentions to Dancer.&nbsp; She gave him an equally loving embrace before removing his mask too.&nbsp; As Prancer had done, he too expressed his love and thanking to the Mistress that had given them the day of their lives.

With both aware the day was at an end for them, the stood in silence, still bound in their pony tack.&nbsp; Mistress turned to Bitch and motioned him to her.&nbsp; She stroked his head as she gave him instructions to release the ponies back to men and let them dress accordingly.&nbsp; He took in her words as her touch soothed and comforted him.&nbsp; Once finished she left Bitch to his duties to seek out her next appointment of the day.

There were no time restraints, nor any urgency.&nbsp; Bitch slowly worked back and forth on the two ponies removing pieces of gear and respectfully packaging each item back into their respective bags.&nbsp; With each removal of gear the ponies felt themselves slipping out of their forced equine minds and back to reality.&nbsp; It was not long before Bitch had each of them still standing in the centre of their stall wearing nothing but the black bodysuits they started with.&nbsp; He then placed their normal clothes on the ground in front of each of them.

Mistress sat on a wooden bench just outside the stables, talking with Madam Que and a few other friends.&nbsp; Bitch was the first to come out, drawing back the curtain as he did.&nbsp; Dancer and Prancer now back in normal clothes sat together on a bail of hay at the back of one of the stalls.&nbsp; 
Mistress motioned Bitch over and to sit at her feet, �Good boy.�&nbsp; She then looked up to the pony-boys as they finished tying their shoelaces.&nbsp; When done, they looked to each other before walking together over to their Mistress and her friends.

�Thank you boys for a memorable day.&nbsp; I know I, and everyone around here loved what you did today, you make me proud.�&nbsp; looking each over they looked so very different, but she could still imagine them in their pony outfits.&nbsp; �Before you both go for the night I wanted you to see this.�&nbsp; She took the shopping bag she was carrying earlier and pulled from it a trophy.&nbsp; Atop the trophy was gold statue of a bound gimp, sitting and awaiting his owner.&nbsp; �Congratulations, you both won second prize in the costume contest today.&nbsp; I do expect you to win me first prize next year, but for now this will do.�&nbsp; She gave them a wicked smile before standing to give each of them a hug.&nbsp; She embraced them from the heart, leaving no doubt of her gratitude for their days effort.

Once content that they were comfortable with what had happened she turned to Bitch.&nbsp; Taking his leash from the bench seat, she clipped it to his collar once more.&nbsp; �My beautiful Ponies, you have finished your day.&nbsp; I thank you.&nbsp; You can now go home and relax, you have earned it.&nbsp; But, I will be contacting you soon, and you will be ready.&nbsp; I have some special duties in store for each of you, but for tonight, it will be Bitch's turn.&nbsp; I will be taking him to a special play party tonight, he has done well today and has earned himself a reward.�&nbsp; She patted him on the head again, his eyes lighting up at her words that he was going to have her full attention.

�So go home you two, and enjoy your evening off.�&nbsp; She half ordered and suggested.

Each of them gave a respectful bow before they took their leave.&nbsp; The sun just dipping under the horizon, they made their way in the diminishing light to the fair gate.&nbsp; Each back in normal clothes and looking like anyone else, but inside they still felt as the ponies they wanted to be.&nbsp; They even fell into step together as they walking out side by side.
